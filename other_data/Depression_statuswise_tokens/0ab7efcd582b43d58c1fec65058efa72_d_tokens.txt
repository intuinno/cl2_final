some day I will be as cool as everyone else and not have to use this cheap cricket phone to facebook . I cant see my own post and a bunch of other stuff if I dont respond to a post comment its because im cheap and cant afford an actual computer . 
being a white girl and having Native care maybe was not the best idea . 
I dont know if I like this whole waking up early thing 
I dont understand how you can be friends with someone on facebook yet in real life you refuse to acknowledge them . I am still crushed inside and well never love a friend like I loved you . I wish you could see me for who I really am 
I got pink eye from a pharmacy tech really who would go to work that way sucks cause I only have one good eye and it happens to be in that one my world has looked fussy all day . Word of advise never get your medicine from someone with a swollen puffy eye .

There comes a point in your life when " FUN " no longer means bar hopping , clubbing or being out til 4am . It means board games , movies , going out for family dinners , bedtime stories , and sleeping in means 8 am . Becoming a parent doesn't change you , instead , it makes you realize that the little people you created deserve the best of your free time ! Re-post if you are PROUD to be a parent :) 
yay for riot radio !!! Nsu 91.3 listen to it NOW !!! my kid loves it ..

My computer has a mind of its own I swear . It took me forever to figure out how to get my mouse to work it wouldnt budge some how it got switch to a mouse device not my touch pad what the hell ?

i gotta figure out how to get Spazz outta jail ! 
Beauty contest today ha I got Randy to wear pink ! wish us luck we could realy use the cash .... 
So I always hated those mom's who took millions of pictures of their kids . now I am one of them . I cant help it she is just so damn cute ! I dont think the year and a half of working @ a portriate studio helped my cause any . Sorry 
I am so sick of people not following thru seriously like 5 people have ditched me in the last 3 weeks I dont have time for this . if you don't wan't to do something just say it dont BS me . It is getting very aggrevating ... 
First time makeing beans and rice hope it goes well ... 
Just watched a very Bias documentary called Pregnant in America . Pretty much just ragged on hospitals , epiderals , and c-sections the whole time . I belive in the whole natural thing but I dont think my baby would be here if it wasn't for my C-section . Documentaries should never be bias i am watching you to learn actual facts your opionion is important but dont down the other side just becuase you think it is wrong . 
Happy Mardi Gras !! 
Wish I was in L.A right now the rain always makes me think of my momma's home town ) : O well I guess oklahoma's wanna be Mardi Gras party will have to do I am gonna try to find a king cake today Randy has no idea what a king cake is haha .. 
I missed the parade ): but I am going to the bar with spazz face today . even though I wont be drinking . I am just gonna watch Spazz get drunk someone has to take care of her . But I am making a shirt since Oklahoma doesn't sell any shirts that say Kiss me I am Cajun .. 
Its been a GREAT day here is an example baby spit up in my eye , horrible cramps , and about three hours spent cleaning up my husbands mess from dinner last night .. 
Ah the life of a mom and a wife ! 
ugh . My body is not taking kindly to this whole being period thing off to the E.R I go :( 
If you could live a seperate life would you ? 
What a beautiful day I think the smoke cleared the air . 
One good thing about living in a small city you never know when your friends well be rideing their bikes down your street ! 
Why is it that I have to jump thru so many damn hope to see a doctor ? 
Sage is 2 months today she is getting so big and slowly but surley getting quit the attitude ! 
wow it takes so much longer to get out of the door when your a mom . feel like i need one of those giant rolling suite cases . 
I am a collage student again I start next week I cant wait to get my brain moving ! 
It is really awesome to hear a doctor say my two month old is extremely smart and strong for her age and that we are doing a good job ! I am very proud of Sage she is 13 pounds and 24 1/4 inches and ranked above average on all of her test !!! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping , whom we've carried but never met , who we have held but couldn't take home , and those who came home but couldn't stay . Make this your status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it because unlike cancer , this is still a taboo subject ! Break the silence . In memory of our angels that were too perfect for Earth !!!..

no body tells us when we are little girls carring our babydolls that its not always fun being a mommy . Those people who have children to create a fairytale family then when they do have kids they dump them off @ Grandparents house so they dont have to deal with them shouldn't have children if you have a child that is your responasability not your parents they already raised thier children come on people own up !
