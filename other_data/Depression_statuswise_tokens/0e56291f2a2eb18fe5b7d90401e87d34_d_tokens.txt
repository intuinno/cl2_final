Wow . I just realized that I really dont like 90% of the people in this town . 
Twilight book five . 
Edward and the cullens get staked Sam and Dean Winchester 
Once I rose above the noise and confusion 
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion 
I was soaring ever higher 
But I flew too high 
Masquerading as a man with a reason 
My charade is the event of the season 
And if I claim to be a wise man , well 
It surely means that I don't know
