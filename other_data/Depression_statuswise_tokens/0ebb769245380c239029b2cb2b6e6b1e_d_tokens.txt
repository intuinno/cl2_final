The Word of God is my strength , and Christ is my Savior , and His Spirit is my guider^^ 
Let us fix our eyes on Jesus , the author and perfecter of our faith , who for the joy set before him endured the cross , scorning its shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God . Hebrews 12:2 
You are my Light , who shines out in my life , and my body . Who fills me with His perfect love and His Spirit .

Why do we sleep through Church , but stay awake for a 3 hour movie ? Why is it hard to pray , but easy to cuss ? Why is it hard to re-post a Godly bulletin , but easy to re post the mean ones ? Why can people worship a celebrity , but not God ? Gonna ignore this ? Afraid to get laughed at ? The Lord said , " If you deny me in front of your friends , I will deny you in front my Father . " Re-post this if you believe in Jesus
