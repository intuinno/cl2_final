PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by pandas . Pandas are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by pandas . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost

.... think I made a bit too much tho ^^ ; 
Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown my sensations , Regrets taught me how to make any hard decisions , Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once , Love is not the word only for the sweet romance , Well , I'm scared , scared , scared , scared to death , And I'm scared to keep on going on my way , Well , I'm scared , scared , scared , scared to death , And I'll tell myself I'm special till the end .. 
There's an underlying understanding , at least that's what i think .. 
I can't read you .. at least that's what I know

I realized this afternoon , that for the last week I have been sleeping for most of the time and in random places around the house like a kitteh x3 on a random note ... my nose hurts O.o wth ? 
Great , my colds back with a vengence > < 
Am I just scared or am I too young to understand what it all really means 
I want something I can't reach , just out of touching distance in time 
I know I must have patience and wait . 
.. but sometimes patience seems such a waste 
Will it all be worth in the end , or will it have all been pretend ? 
Gettin tired of your worrying , why don't you stop worrying and actually help for once .... -.- 
The one person who i thought would never lie to me , did ... for a really stupid reason ... you pain in ass
