everyone is unique . everyone has its own persona . the magic of connecting is that eventhough we are different from each other . we still find something that magnetize us from one another ... but somehow sometimes the magic disappears and the connection is lost forever ... 
another day has ended ... and tomorrow is another day ... a never ending cycle ... a cycle going on and on ... day to night .. night to day ... same old same old ... whats the point of living ... are we bound to never ending trying to be responsible and doing the right thing ... hehehe trying to be a poet lang

BANZAI 
sakit ako tiyan ... dont want to go to work ... 
life is pain .... i heard that once in a movie ... and i think its right ... if you cant survive that pain then its the end of you ... learn that the hard way hehe 
u r who u r ... dont let others compromise who u reli r ... Self pity is a quicksand ... when u pity yourself is the greatest tragedy of all ... 
pain and change result is growth ... i think sir is right ... life is really something ha ... no reklams i cant wait for the next chapter ... :)

life and its questions ... everything happens for a reason ... i may not know the answers now but i know someday i will have it ... looking up and asking the heavens to give me strength and hoping that i will not lose myself again ... 
my head is spinning and spinning ... i think i'm going nuts ... people see me and they think i'm strong but i think i am just a weakling trying to project someone who is that strong ... im a hypocrite ... :( 
work again tomorrow .... haaaaay nosebleed .... at least im not under the sun ... im sorry to all the farmers who lost their crops ... its devastating when what you work hard for , all turn to crap in the end ... all you have to do is survived ... theres always tomorrow ... :)

El Nino will make many people hungry ... Drought is such a tragedy ... 
work again tomorrow ... xerox here xerox there xerox xerox everywhere ... in fairness im happy in my new job .. no dull moment ma yawyawan ka lang ug kalit na wa ka kahibalo unsa sala mo hehehe .... everyday is an adventure ang tirada haha .... Banzai !!! :) 
a heart that is cold as ice ... a heart that once that try too be warm but end up going back as cold as ice ... lost in an never ending turmoil in her own mind .... looking up in the heavens trying to find the answers she is seeking .. 
next step ... what to do ... what to do ... whats my next step ...

trying to hide behind a mask ... always trying to hide behind a mask ... smiling , laughing and trying not to let others see what is behind the mask ... haaaay buhay parang sine ay ... crap 
and the next chapter begins ... hmmm i hope its a good one 
Life is all about not planning but how you ride the roller coaster experiences that fate put you into .... 
im in a dilemma again ... my mind is stagnant again ... another twist and i dont know what to do ... crap 
why do i over dramatize everything ay .... haaaaay im way too abnormal ay ... i way too over analyze everything ay .... haaaaaay dukol me hehehe .... 
i thought my path is that na ... i shouldnt complain coz its a good opportunity but i dont know .... i will figure it out eventually hehe ... i shouldnt complain ... im always tryin to run away ... its time that i face everything and live my life ... haaaaay its easy to say hard to do .... crap ... crap .... come what may ... ok bring it on !!!! 
the cruelest thing makes you appreciate the most beautiful things .... everything has its reasons .... so the past you cant do anything about it all you have to do is see it as part of growing up ... we stumble n we fall theres no choice but to stand up .. if change is necessary then do it ... be strong ... 
COME WHAT MAY .....

the one who only believe his/her eyes can cloud the heart and the brain ....

such a nostalgic feeling seeing myself all throughout my pics .... its funny thinking that the world is changing or is it me .... walking through memory lane is really something ay hehe 
when something happen that is not part of our plan . when fate 
intervenes & everything we do we are like trap in a one big circle 
were its like heaven & hell is mixed up then 1 big question mark 
pops up in ur head & u r drowning in ur own confusion . then 
u r in the mercy of fate . life is mystery and if u dont have 
the power 2 b headstrong then what fate will throw at u will break 
u or it will make u . its up to u

meeting someone who can hold you in the world full of strangers ... someone who found you and held your hand in the dark times is somewhat like a miracle .... cherish it and dont let it go without fight when the darkness ends and the light comes ... may it be friends , lover , etc ... that miracle is hard to find ... 
After 11 years of familiarity .... Its hard to swallow that everything is going to an end .... Great change is about to happen and I cant do anything about it .... All I have to do as accept it and miss all that I have to let go and face the future of unfamiliarity ... A start of a new beginning ... 
bored with my life .... routine .... everything is routine .... boooooorrrrreeeeeddddd .... need something to spice it up .... 
I'm here na land of multi cultural city .. Hay life is great .. :) 
People pisses me off .... I hate it when kaya ra nila ang papika pika ..... They can tell me what they want to tell me in my face .... Im not afraid of them ..... Really PISSES ME OFF !!!! 
went to travel n back again ..... hope i can do it again .... next stop JAPAN !!!! hehe someday i hope .... 
fate is really something .... sometimes it do something that you cant comprehend ... why is it that you do something and you achieve it ... and instantly something happen and you are back to where you started .... is it fate or bullshit ???? : < 
life is all about the journey and not the destination ..... it will have a rough part sometimes coz the journey is not perfect ... why it is there is like asking why theres holes in the road . life is not all about perfection . it is a journey to try to embrace its imperfection ... 
when all is lost ... you will see who is true and who is not .... 
“Be patient . Don’t rush everything . Everything happens for a reason even if it’s negative or positive . Be positive always , and always love the people who actually help you from the very beginning – don’t forget them . Have faith in God and love your family . ” by Charice .... nice quote .... 
round and round .... you took a step forward and something happen and you feel you step back .... crap .... 
one major screw up .... good thing its taken care of already ..... thank god ...
