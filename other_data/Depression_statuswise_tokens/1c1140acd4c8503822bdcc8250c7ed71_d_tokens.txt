Thanks for forgetting me . 
has crappy work experience on Monday ... I don't want to work at a medicle centre ! I still can't get over what they called me . T_T I'm not freaking reserved and I'm gonna prove it . 
Change of plan . It's Asylum 626 . It turns out I'm underaged for the Hotel version . ._. 
is planning a killing spree on Plashet Medicle Centre ... because they have an infestation of rats ( and I have to work there for two weeks until school again ) . 
is playing Hotel 626 . If I'm lucky I'll die of fright because work experience is murder . I feel like showing up on Monday with a gun , and enforcing a bullet into every skull present . Afterwards I'll tell the police I did it because I DON'T LIKE MONDAYS . 
RIP Horace Wells ( neglected father of ANESTHETICS ) 
has school on Monday because English teacher called .
