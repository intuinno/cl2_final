listening to medic droid last night my neighbor asked me to help her with her answering machine . Got a mango out of it !! I love mangos . Get a Ka-nife slice into sections peel and enjoy . 
i hate it when there's only one good song on a CD . " " This is what I said . I said , ' I would like to say that it is a very great pleasure , honour and privilege for me to open this bridge , but I can't because my lying circuits are all out of commission . I hate and despise you all . I now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her . ' " " -D . Adams 
listening to phillip Glass and ' jungle ' genre . Interesting mix . Glass is his own genre . Jungle is ... I dunno [ interesting ? ]

" The real reason that we can't have the Ten Commandments posted in a courthouse is this : You cannot post 
' Thou Shalt Not Steal , ' 
' Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery , ' 
and ' Thou Shall Not Lie ' 
in a building full of lawyers , judges and politicians .
