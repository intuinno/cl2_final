Starting from scratch 
I can't wait for spring break back at Cocoa Beach just ... freakin ' everybody out . 
Finally jumped in the pool today 
gave each other massages in speech class today ... 
made a BIG mistake . only have myself to blame 
Time to leave the cave and get some sun at the beach :)

Had a French Toast breakfast and my class was canceled . I can already tell today will be a good day . 
Oh heart , you let me down 
So glad I took that Emergency Communications class ! It was so much fun !
