" By casting this ballot , I do pledge myself to abide by the result of

the ensuing General Election . "

Really appreciates not being called out on the obvious today , even in the presence of irrefutable evidence . That was a truly kosher thing to do , and any kindness done to me shall be repaid :)

Have you ever been in love ? Horrible isn't it ? It makes you so vulnerable . It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up . You build up all these defenses , you build up a whole suit of armor , so that nothing can hurt you , then one stupid person , no different from any other stupid person , wanders into your stupid life ... ( 1 of 3 ) 
You give them a piece of you . They didn't ask for it . They did something dumb one day , like kiss you or smile at you , and then your life isn't your own anymore . Love takes hostages . It gets inside you . It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness , so simple a phrase like ' maybe we should be just friends ' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart . 
It hurts . Not just in the imagination . Not just in the mind . It's a soul-hurt , a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain . I hate love .  - Neil Gaiman ( 3 of 3 )

God bless the countless families throughout Alabama and beyond who were and will be affected by yesterday's storms . 
Friends are going to network and pull through this aftermath . If you know of any reclusive people in your community , however , consider that they may not have the same access and opportunities . Especially the elderly . If you're aware of anyone who fits this description , let me or someone else know . There has been an outpouring of aid in Northern Alabama , it just needs to be pointed in the direction ! :) 
BARACK OBAMA DOES NOT CARE ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE /kanyeface 
When donating goods toward the tornado relief effort , please keep in mind that there are infants impacted as well . Formula , diapers , etc are being grossly overlooked !! 
To the jerks claiming that Wednesday's tornado in Tuscaloosa was " revenge " or " karma " for the poisoning at Toomer's ... You are sick , sad and COLD . 
Would like to know why supplies are being STAGED at Maxwell . They STAGED plenty after Katrina too that never made it to anyone , that's why you can buy FEMA trailers for $10 now . Homeland Security has facilities right here in Calhoun Co . Afraid of actually HELPING ? Also , didn't FEMA just spend $1B on MREs and Port-a-potties for The Great Central US ShakeOut ? Can they not be repurposed and MOBILIZED ? ( 1/3 ) 
What a coincidence , FEMA stages a disaster drill for April 28 , ties up at least a Billion in taxpayer resources and then FAILS to deliver during an actual disaster THE SAME DAY ! ( 2/3 ) 
It's not George Bush who doesn't care about Black people or Obama who doesn't care about White people ... IT'S GOVERNMENT WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE * AMERICAN * PEOPLE WHO FILL IT'S COFFERS ! But it's not our money they're courting anymore . So send the aid to Japan and China , right ? But hey ... if they'll turn their backs on SOLDIERS to play political games , does any of this really come as a surprise ? ( 3/3 ) 
Got stranded at home today , so I am working on a portrait of Michael C . Hall as Dexter and thinking of trying to auction it for the relief effort . 
Dude ... Osama Bin Laden is dead ? Pour one out for one's homies . 
Obama releases his birth certificate , kills a terrorist and aids in a National disaster all in one week ? I'm calling shenanigans . Watch this joker get re-elected . 
Bin Laden QUICKLY ' buried at sea ' before positive identification on American soil ? DEFINITELY calling bullshit . Wow ... SINCE WHEN IS THIS THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS ? 
" Finding a country willing to accept the remains of the worlds most wanted terrorist would have been difficult " the official said . So the U.S. decided to bury him at sea . Uhhh ... We would have taken them !!! 
more drone trails today ... more tstorms tonight . And the beat goes on ... 
Dear God , I want to thank you for my beautiful child , my yummy bowl of Froot Loops , and a government so adept and efficient that we hardly even notice how adept and efficient they are !

Sick again , it seems :( Just remember kids , a boom box is not a toy . 
Alfred ( Michael Gough ) died ? ALFRED ? Seriously ? And not a word was spoken ... shame . 
I've carried my child within my body , Slept with my child on my chest . I've kissed little toes & wiped away tears . I've been puked on , peed on & spent sleepless nights cradling my child , but I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM , and there is no greater Honor , Love ..... or Blessing !! Post this as your status if you are a Very Proud Mom . 
Helpful suggestion of the day : When you're caught , that's it . Just give up . Or risk looking like the world's biggest asshole . 
And thus , my epic weedeating is rewarded with a giant bowl of broccoli and cheese .
