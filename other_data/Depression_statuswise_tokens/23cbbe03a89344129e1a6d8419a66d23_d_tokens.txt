Why do we sleep through Church , but stay awake for a 3 hour movie ? Why is it hard to pray , but easy to cuss ? Why is it hard to re-post a Godly bulletin , but easy to re-post the mean ones ? Why can people worship a celebrity , but not God ? Gonna ignore this ? Afraid to get laughed at ? The Lord said , " If you deny me in front of your friends , I will deny you in front my Father .
