" I royally screwed up " 
" I post the signs 
For all to see 
But i get no reply 
Because no one loves me " 
" Everybody bites it sooner or later , im just in the AP class , ahead of the game " 
" Everyone sees who I appear to be but only a few know the real me , you only see what I choose to show there's so much behind my smile you just don't know . " 
" There is nothing sadder than a child who has barely seen the world , yet who has seen enough of it to know that he does not wish to be a part of it ... " 
The fear of death follows from the fear of life . A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time . ~ Mark Twain
