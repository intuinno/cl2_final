Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . Sadly there is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% wont copy and paste this , many because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ?
