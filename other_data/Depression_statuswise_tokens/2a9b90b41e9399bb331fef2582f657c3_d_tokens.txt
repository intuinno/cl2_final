Is so sad that Hagane No Renkinjutsushi Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood is really finally ending . T T.T T It was nice for the past few years . It's first in my favorites so far . <3 
Who wants to hang out over the summer ...? 
-Sigh- No luck . 
Just passed by a house with a Christmas tree ... 
Hagane No Renkinjutsushi : Fulmetal Alchemist Brotherhood manga ended ... I cried . 
Watching Curious George . 
I need to delete some friends ... 
Oh ho . I'm so horrible for not even starting the next chapter ~ And its been like ... A month ? Eh ... Not so bad . I'll make them wait another month . 
DAMMIT . Jenn and I tried to catch an abandoned dog . The little ones are so stubborn . WHO ARE THOSE STUPID LITTLE OWNERS AND WHY WOULD THEY ABANDON SUCH A SMALL DOG IN THE PARKING LOT WHERE THE COYOTES ARE ?! 
Did nothing but work for Christmas eve . I was planning to be a scrooge tomorrow for Christmas and sleep all day , but we just decided to throw in some last minute things . Mom and Dad are going to Palms Springs or something , so Christmas is going to be small this year . 
OH WHAT DA ' HELL ? Jenn Eunjung Choi , Joy Seohyun Jeon and Lisa Cheung , remember that crappy looking Amuto tablet sketch ? Well ... I submitted it to deviantart and already got 3 favorites in less than a minute . 
... I lost the list of vocabulary for Visconti ... Can someone give me the list we're being tested on ? 
-Sigh- The past is a pain in the ass . The future is just troublesome too think about . And the present is just too boring . 
Yup . It's official . I have to go to tutoring EVERY WEEKDAY . On Saturday , I have to go to the Art Center in Pasadena then go straight to my mom's store in El Monte . Sunday is my only day off ... But I might have to spend it cleaning my room and buying art supplies and doing my other homework ... F *** MY SUMMER LIFE . 
I can't believe that one of the camera crew members got stuck inside the Pyramid . 
I hate mysoju.com . 
OMG . As I look at more Comic-Con Pics from Mythbusters , I'm think , " IF THEY'RE GOING NEXT YEAR , I'M SO F*CKING GOING . " 
Almost time to deal with the teachers . 
Theory : People who can't draw , can write . People who can't write , can draw . People who can do both ... Er ... No theory for that yet . 
There is no one to talk to . 
I'm trying to do manga coloring ... So far , HORRIBLE . I'm only on the cleaning part , and I give up . I can't find a easier way for the cleaning . The directions aren't specific enough and there's nothing for Elements 8.0 . T T.T T 
Stewie is a masochist ? o.o

I have to go to a tutoring thing today . I don't even know where it is . What it's called . Or anything . Mommy just signed me up said , " You're going there today . " And I was like , " Whaaaaaat ? " 
I want to sleep , but Shayla is demanding me to wear a costume for her party on Sunday , so I have to finish making it by then ... 
I noticed that I work harder on cold , rainy days like today . . §§§§§ .
