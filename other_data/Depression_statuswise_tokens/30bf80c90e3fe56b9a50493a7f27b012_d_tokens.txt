Last night's Linkin Park concert was good . :) 
Got my prom dress and shoes today . My dress is BEAUTIFUL . My sister describes it as a light sunset orange . It's sparkly and flowy where it needs to be . :D 
I can't believe I stayed up late last night to do my Controversial Scientist project ... and it wasn't even due for me today ... Guess that means I'll just make it much better :) 
Trending at #3 on Yahoo ! is ... Muffin tops ... 
What's more scary ? 
Oxford English Dictionary now features " Muffin top " as a new word , along with " LOL " and " OMG " . 
Homework is the bane of my existence ... 
I HATE MY ENGLISH HOMEWORK . I never should have taken 3 English classes ! There's no way I can get all my homework done and get proper sleep tonight !

I'm so glad high school's almost over , especially since I've realized that I simply just don't care about most of my classmates , my teachers , my classes , my clubs , etcetera . College is all I really care about right now . If I happen to " Unfriend " you , it doesn't mean I dislike you . It just means I don't really care at all . Sorry . 
Anyone know of anywhere that's hiring right now ? 
If you have a tumblr , then be sure to let me know the link to it as I now have one . :) 
" The more symmetrical you are , the better a dancer you are . " Really ? Then that must mean most people aren't very symmetrical , huh ?

HAPPY FESTIVUS EVERYONE ! XP 
My mood's in need of a boost right now ... Say something funny or nice , please . 
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWILIGHT BARBIE DOLLS ? I've seen them ! 
Working on my English essay ... Oh joy . 
I just love how Kpop music videos have beautiful/expensive cars in them for no reason at all . :)
