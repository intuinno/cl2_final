Falling to deep , 
Crawling to far . 
I know what you want 
I know who you are . 

These things you tell me , 
They look like lies . 
And don't you know , 
I can see your disguise . 
Cause if you hurt me , 
You Know I'll hide . 
And don't embarrass me , 
Cause I'm made of pride . 
Ask me no questions , 
I'll tell you no lies . 
Now tell me the truth 
Or the heart of us dies 
It was a long time ago now , 
But it feels so near 
He's gone forever , 
Not coming back here 
We were so young , 
So tender , so fresh 
We had no hearts , 
just skin , bone and flesh 
I felt not for him 
And he not for me , 
Till that one winter evening 
When our hearts were set free 
The sea breeze was strong 
And the tide was high . 
But we didn't care 
For there was a sun in the sky 
Little Red 
Riding Hood didn't listen to Mama , Pinocchio was a liar , Robin Hood a
