" Just smile and there's nothing you can't overcome 
The sky is a continuous cotton candy 
Even if it collapse down , it wouldn’t matter 
Even if it rain heavily , it wouldn’t matter 
Might as well happily drench yourself 
The rainbow is a smiling face 
Sadness bye bye 
You don't need a reason to be happy "
