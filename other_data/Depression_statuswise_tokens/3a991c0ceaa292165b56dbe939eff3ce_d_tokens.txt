It's MOTORCYCLE SEASON ! Remind all of your family and friends that it is motorcycle season and taking a few extra seconds to take a second look may save lives of our ? ' d ones . Give them their fair share of the roadway and don't follow too close ! PLEASE RE-POST , even if you are not a bike rider ... LOOK TWICE !.... SAVE LIVES !!! ?

Let me get this straight Charlie Sheen can make a “porn family” , Kelsey Grammar can end a 15 year marriage over the phone , Larry King can be on divorce #9 , Britney Spears can have a 55 hour marriage , and Jesse James and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE . Yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Repost if you are proud to support equal rights . 
A 15 year old girl holds hands with her 1 year old son . People call her a slut , but no one knows she was raped at 13 . People call another guy fat . No one knows he has a serious disease causing him to be overweight . People call an old man ugly . No one knew he had a serious injury to his face while fighting for our country in the war . Repost this if you are against bullying and stereotyping . I bet 96% of you won't . 
Stupid cancer ... We all want a new car ... A new phone ... Freedom ... A person who has cancer only wants one thing ... To survive . I know a lot of you " who think you're too cool " probably won't repost this . But a very little amount of my friends will . Put this on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer , survived , or who is fighting against it now
