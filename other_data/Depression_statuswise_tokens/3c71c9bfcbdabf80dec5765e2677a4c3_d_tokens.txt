I just remember this one time I went to get a burrito and the guy making the burrito was eating from it . At the time it didn't bother me but now I'm disgusted . 
Today , I was thinking of not being a vegetarian anymore on another note I went off on a freshmen weird but I have the smallest patience today :( I feel bad but oh well . 
Do you ever get these moments when your cleaning things out and you run into an old picture or a thing that an old friend gave you and you think damn what happen to us . How things got so bad between us I will never know all I know is I kinda miss our friendship but it took two and one of gave no effort

Singing Chase Coy like a mad man 
Fighting evil by moon light winning love by day light never running from a real fight she is the one named Sailor Moon :) 
Facebook is so confusing and apparently I don't know how to spell my own last name but thanks to Kim Pham that was changed . I'm going to go off now and watch the Ultimate fighter like a loser haha . 
I'm beyond angry . 
My arm still hurts from yesterday from Jiu Jitsu but today it feels even worse that's what I get for having too much pride .
