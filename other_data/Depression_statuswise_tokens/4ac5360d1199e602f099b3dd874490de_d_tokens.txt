Okay so it's hard enough solving a Rubix Cube in the first place , but what happens if your color blind ?

ONLY ONE DAY LEFT OF SCHOOL !!!!!!! 
Went on hike w/bro . We wer 2 find a Mystique Lake 5 1/2 miles up mountain , never found it . Trail was creepy , no people @all . Found sign that was2 tell wher r location was , hadn't been updated since 1979 . Storm cam w/ lightening , thunder , hail . We heard a growl , saw nothing . Dissapointed in not finding the lake , we headed back , my bro fel due2 slickness of trail , HA . Got bak2vehicle afta mny hours of hikin . Tht was my adventure2day . 
..... wish the rain would go away ..... 
Was on top of North America's tallest sand dune , and I got to go white water rafting ! These last two days were soo fun ! 
Ugh ! School is already long and boring . Only a bazillion days left till summer break again . 
absolutely and completely bored right now 
Well isn't this funny .... Our washing machine , microwave , downstairs fridge , and the ignition to start our van are all broken ! It's ridiculous ! It's like our appliances all decided as a group to quit , for no reason ! 
Had a horrible migrane , went to the doctor said it's possibly due to a imbalance in my muscle/skeletal system . In other words a very slight case of scoliosis(however you spell that ) . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ! 
Had a blast at the Rendezvous ! 
I noticed in movies that whenever some bad guy is trying to take an object of importance away from the good guy or whatever , there always seems to be a fire place the person can throw it into , so the bad guys don't get hold of it . 
Morgan : Shhhhsh ! Everybody listen ! The class sounds like a bunch of walruses ! Haha ! 
Miranda : Why isn't the vending machine taking my quarter ? 
Me : Umm maybe cus it's a korean shilling ! Bahahahahahahaha ! 
" did u just call me a giraffe ?!!? " " no dude YOU just called me giraffe . . . "
