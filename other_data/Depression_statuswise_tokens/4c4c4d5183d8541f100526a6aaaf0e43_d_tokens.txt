y'know , 
i much prefer the way my professor runs his class than the way any of 
my highschool classes have been . read the lecture , and a paper due at

Q : What is your guilty pleasure ? 

A : Hmm .. I guess any drama show on ABC Family . Secret Life , Make It or Break It , Greek , you name it . It can be pretty embarrassing to admit I watch some of those shows . 
didn't think it would be this difficult to stay chill about how I feel . 
probably worst day yet . hopefully something will get better soon . 
turns out I didn't have to go looking for a Halloween costume , because I have everything I need in my closet . leopard dress + leggings + Uggs + plastic ears = leopard . yeah man .

practiced for 4 and a half hours today .. oh man . so much music ! and the wind ensemble music is SUPER HARDDDDDDDDDDD . AHHH I LOVE IT . :D

I don't want to sound like a whiny baby , but I really need a break . I'm just really overwhelmed and it's turning me into something I don't want to be .

The animal you remind me of . 5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 . My favorite thing about you . 7 . Give you a ... weird nickname . 8 . Challenge you to post this . 
midterms week = no english .. meaning I'm free from 11-3 on MWF . life is good . :] 
we won our homecoming , did NHS ? :] 
uhh , so Red bus saves my life . yeah . 
can't listen to music and notate triads at the same time . bahahahahah :] 
learned how to support my singing todayyyy :D 
hoping to go out tonight cause I can't take this anymore . 
welp , guess I have to start on my homework now . I'll pop in my All-State recording to make it better :] 
I think I should reward myself with a little Facebook time .. I have four pages of my five page paper done .. and I still have two hours left to finish it . Jury at 4 ... wish me luck ! 
Lindsey Ruberg TOTALLY FIXED MY CD DRIVE . :DDDDDDD yesssssssss . 
finally got iTunes up on this laptop . :] 
oh golden delicious apples , how I've missed you . 
Q : Do consider me a friend ? What is your favorite memory of us together ? 
A : Of course I consider you a friend ! Favorite memory .. hmmm . We've had a lot of fun moments :] Probably your first year of flute camp , when we first met . I heard you playing and started freaking out because I was so excited we had someone of an awesome caliber there , and you had this look on your face like you thought I was crazy . :D 
marching band , then wind ensemble concert ! everyone should come out to hear us ! :] 
they're showing Eclipse in the Union on Friday at 8:30 pm .. ohhhh yes . all I wanna know is .. how the heck did they get the rights to it ? it doesn't come out on DVD until December ... but who cares ! :D 
I'd much rather practice than watch the Superbowl . Kcya ! 
is on a search for the perfect recital dress .. 
had to do it . Vulpix is adorable . 
Happy birthday best friend Sarah Shulman , wife Katie Stieghorst , and my favorite actor Freddie Highmore . :] 
Danielle Hetzel , Adam J.D. Beck , Jeremy ' Grif ' Lippert , Adam Brostowitz , Hutch Restarski , Stavros , Jonathan Wilcoxen , Cassandra , Mike , and all the other ML seniors , marching band will never be the same without you . You will be missed . MYNWA <3 
happy llama , sad llama , totally rad llama , super llama , drama llama , big fat momma llama ... 
had another awesome night with DaMar Hampton and Kristen Barnett , we just added Karen Sanders into the mix this time . :] 
homework day . joy . 
I really miss my boys . ( Hint : Hanson . ) 
is it sad that I can recognize songs on the Harry Potter soundtracks by name ? 
men are hopeless . 
went to beu because my shoulder was throbbing like mad during theory . I was practically writhing in my seat the entire time because it hurt so bad . beu said , " take some painkillers and suck it up . " screw you , beu , screw you . 
glad to be back :] 
mock audition went quite well ... I think I've definitely improved since my first ensemble audition at the beginning of the fall semester . 
its a jersey thing 
can't wait to bring back the rest of my DVDs from home , so I'll actually have variety .. and not have to watch something I've already watched . 
almost 80 degrees today . that's what I'm talkin ' about . 
:O Ralph Fiennes is the voice of Ramses in The Prince of Egypt ! Yay Voldemort :] 
Q : What ensembles do you play in at school ? 
A : This semester I'm in marching band and wind ensemble . Next semester ... well , next semester depends on how my audition goes . I could either be in Concert Band or Orchestra .. So . Next semester = no marching band , wind ensemble , and concert band/orchestra . 
this week needs to be over . right now . 
iTunes , you suck for keeping me up so late . your music is too good to resist ... 
I'm so sick of my neighbors . Every day since I've been here , they have their TV or their music up so loud that I can hear it through the walls . Not only that , but I can hear everything they say through the walls . I go to my RA , and I complain at the front desk , and they still don't get it . It's even 24 hour quiet this week , and I can hear everything going on over there . What is it going to take ? 
Andrea Owens and Julianne Boo are freakin ' awesome . Just sayin ' . 
Alright Facebook , start listing some great flute solos you think I haven't played . Ready , go ! 
I unfortunately have a research paper to finish tonight . 
had a fun time with Julie Ann Evans and Christina Prahler last night . :] 
great job , fighting and marching leathernecks ! // going out tonight with the girls . :] 
had one awesome time with Kristen Barnett and DaMar Hampton tonight . :] 
Dear fiction books , 
I miss you . 
Love , Molly 
Hanson's " I Will Come To You " still makes my heart melt . 
is officially scared . Just saw the list of classes I have to take in order to get my teacher certification . Whose idea was it that I get an education degree , again ? 
home hasn't changed much .. although I did notice they painted the sex store pink and they're doing construction in front of AC Moore . oh , and they're changing the dance studio AGAIN . other than that , nothing has really changed . 
awesome job , PMA ! :] 
had a great time spending New Year's Eve with my bestie , Sarah Shulman , even though I could hardly stay awake for all the late night fun :] 
Thanks Daddy , SP4 Gary Fuller , for your service to the US . Love you :] 
saw HP7 with Sarah Shulman yesterday , and saw it yet again with Gabby Gilligo today . life is good :]

break is over too soon .. good thing there is only three weeks until I get to come home again . 
misses Andrea Owens , Katie Stieghorst , Lindsey Ruberg , Kyle Kraemer , Zachtopher Friant , Miki Simmons ...

I bet you I could go to London and fit in .

3333333333 : What an obnoxious number ... :] You're my sister . You're my best friend . You're the person I can always turn to and I know you'll always be there to listen to me . You're the awesomest person I know . I don't know what I would do without you <3 
is in the midst of trying to shove everything possible in my suitcase ... 
82.95 : Hi !! :D I miss you like crazy ! I hope lessons are going well , and I hope you'll tell Mrs. Olson that I miss her ALOTALOTALOTALOTALOTALOT . Yeah . :D Tell me everything you're playing right now !! You're an incredibly sweet girl and I'm quite glad we're fellow flutes . Can't wait to see you ! 
ALS is a condition where a person loses the ability to use their arms , hands , and legs , and sometimes even the ability to speak and swallow . The WIU Marching Leathernecks are teaming up with the ALS Association to help raise money for people with ALS . Just a few spare dollars can help , if you feel so inclined to donate . http://web.alsa.org/site/TR/ALSEvent/SaintLouis?px=2915400&pg=personal&fr_id=7110

oh hey Jersey , I see you didn't get any snow ... :D 
I'm not sure why I brought sunblock to school ... it's not like there's a beach around here . 
performing one of my pieces for my recital at open mic tonight . hopefully it goes well .. 
today . will be epic . 
just have to get through my english final and then my piano final tomorrow , and then I'm set to go back to Jersey <3 
finishing up the LOTR series with the extended version of Return of the King today . :] 
oh New Jersey , how I've missed you ... 
last football game of the season today <3 
thought my performance went quite well tonight :] 
went to a Lutheran service this morning . it was definitely different . 
Perhaps I should belt out some bassoon as loud as I possibly can in my room so my lovely neighbors get a taste of their own medicine . 
is glad to have friends like Andrea Owens , Lindsey Ruberg , Zachtopher Friant , Kyle Kraemer , and Katie Stieghorst here at WIU . :] 
a day full of packing , practicing audition excerpts , watching movies with mom , and cooking ! :]

in the middle of my attempt to leave videos on most of my friends ' pages , my camera decided to " not be found . " awesomesauce . 
anyone know where I can get a cheap , small TV around Macomb ? how about a DVD player ? 
have to somehow scrounge together this FYE paper today , take my FYE final , anddddd beast my jury ... yikes ? 
In order to further distract me from finishing my theory homework , you should inbox me a number and I'll tell you what's up . :] 
oh no .. auditions are on Monday at 12:30 CT for flutes ... and my flight doesn't leave Newark until 12 ET the same day . how could this have happened ? 
is kind of addicted to the Welch's strawberry soda they sell in the c-store ... 
got invited to join the Honors College // figured bass , I despise you . 
never thought I'd miss home this much . 
I believe coming to Western was the best decision I ever made in my life . 
paper , done . jury , done . I never seem to sound as good as I can when I'm nervous .. but I guess that's only to be expected ? 
I'd prefer not to be a Gemini , stupid new zodiac system .. 
Exactly one year ago today , I auditioned/was accepted into the School of Music here at Western Illinois University . <3 
gonna bring in the new year with my best friend in the world , Sarah Shulman . 
got through the first half of the day with flyings colors , and in a great mood . now for the second half : lesson , studio , concert band . let's go !! :D 
What the heck will it take to get my neighbors to shut ! up ! 
This is one of those days where I wish I lived in a freshman dorm , so I could be hanging out with my friends right now ... ah well . Guess it's time to finish cleaning . 
As soon as the semester is over and I come home , Vanessa Kwok , Justin Lien , and Kaylla Cantilina , we MUST run over to Princeton . Pronto .

Can someone explain why my parents paid $ 1,515 for my meal plan , but I only ever see $900some of that money on my ID when I first buy something from the caf ? 
fantastic mood :] now I just need to be at the beach to make it better ... :P 
I was so into my practicing tonight and I was playing so intensely that I think I must have locked my jaw .. and now it hurts . :[ But nevertheless , it was an awesome session ! :] 
Camerata was absolutely fantastic tonight ! LaMoine , props to you as well ! // When Dr. Huff articulates , it looks like he's munchin ' on his reed :]

What a fantastic stream . I wish the boys would do this sort of thing more often . <3 
Zac is singing the most beautiful song ever right now . #hanson live on http://www.livestream.com/hansonmusic

getting up early to go to the contemporary service at Wesley UMC :] 
nothing like some Rally For One to make my night more awesome <3 
Hmm ... Memoirs of a Geisha or Spiderman ? 
Two awesome movies in a day : Remember the Titans at 2 , and August Rush at 4 . :] Then I'm gunna watch Spiderman since I got more votes for that than Memoirs of a Geisha . // Happy . <3 
Every time I watch Spiderman , it reminds me of senior year in marching band at NHS and the Danny Elfman themed show . Good times . 
It's audition day ! :D Put on a smile ! Today is going to be an awesome day . 
" Count yourself blessed every time someone cuts you down or throws you out , every time someone smears or blackens your name to discredit me . What it means is that the truth is too close for comfort and that that person is uncomfortable . You can be glad when that happens -- skip like a lamb , if you like ! -- for even though they don't like it , I do ... and all Heaven applauds . " -- Luke 6:22 ( from The Message ) 
been thinking about ASP lately , and how much I miss it . 
Today is going to be the awesomest day ever ! Nothing can bring me down :] 
My heart beats only for you . 
Of course it would be concert day and my lips are so chapped that I can't play correctly . AWESOMEEEEE . 
Just had one the of the greatest concerts ever . WIU Wind Ensemble , we rock ! :D 
Good job , WIU Concert Band . I conquered my chapped lips and defeated my solos ! Woot ! :] 
" It's like a never-ending chain of smiles . :] " 
" Stop it !! " 
absolutely fantastic service this morning , and an incredible night last night . :] 
did not sing nearly enough today . 
I'll have the sweetest dreams , just for you . 
Best Monday in a long time ? Yeah , I think so . :D 
11 days til Jersey <3 
Arranging pieces for a mallet ensemble is not easy . At all . 
I could definitely go for some spring break right now . Homework is piling up and getting on my nerves . Grr . :P 
I'm watching old YouTube videos of me , and I'm realizing just how much I've improved since last year . :] 
Mmm , rain <3 
There aren't enough words in the English language to describe how amazing the orchestra concert was tonight . 
Well , looks I'll have visited two states I haven't been to by the time spring break is over . 
Thank you Daddy , Gary Fuller , for getting my copy of Breaking Dawn signed by Peter Facinelli <3 
Had an awesome girl's night/Jane Austen movie night with Kathleen McGowan , Alyssa Rae Stasicky , and Abby Chien . :] 
Five more days . Just five more days , and then I'll be home . :] 
I love Kristen Carlstrom for writing me letters and coloring pictures for me to hang up at school :D 
I keep thinking this week is going faster than it actually is . Today I woke up thinking it was Thursday . 
Stay with me . This is what I need , please . 
So ready to be out of here . Spring break , get here faster . 
One more day . Just one more day . Gotta keep telling myself that . One more day ... 
this time tomorrow , I'll be HOME !! :DDDDDDD 
Oh hey , New Jersey . Good to see you again . // Just spent the most amazing weekend with the most incredible guy ever . :] 
I get to see Josh Peck again this weekend <3333 
It's impossible not to be happy on a day like this . :] 
I love Josh Peck so much . :] 
Only 56 more days until I'm home again . Recital in two weeks , and my parents and Josh Peck are coming to see me play :DDDDDD 
Today is a perfect day :] In the best mood .. nothing can bring me down ! 
Joshua Michael Peck , you make my life so much better . I don't know how I've lived this long without you . I love you with all that I have and I'll never stop . <3 
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you :] 
had a wonderful hour-long talk/practice session/dinner talk with DaMar Hampton :] 
best time for the 7x7 Rubik's cube so far : 16:33 . 23 :D 
LOL the Domino's delivery guy definitely just attempted to hit on me . Nice . 
My recital is in five days . 
... AHHHHHHHHHHHH ! 
So , a few people have seen me solving my 7x7 Rubik's cube in Browne .. and they're all like , " Is that for real , or is it a decoration/joke ? " People of Browne , it's for real . I'm not trying to fake anybody out . I'm a Rubik's nerd , what can I say ? :] 
I don't get a break for myself until Sunday .. here we go . T_T 
Is today over yet ? No , of course it isn't . I still have an FYE even to go to , a psych study guide to do , theory homework , AND I need to practice piano . It's going to be a long night . 
Dear Enterprise Rent-A-Car , you have officially ruined my night by giving my parents a jank car . Instead of arriving in about a half hour from now , they won't get here for another four . Thanks , thanks a lot . 
Mary Johnson Fuller , Gary Fuller , and Josh Peck just left . Only six weeks .. yet it still feels so far away . I miss you already <3 
It's so hard to watch the three people you love most get in a car and drive away from you , knowing you won't see them again until the summer . 
Wind Ensemble Tour = Sleep ? What's that ? 
WE Tour - over . Great job everyone ! :] 
A Very Potter Musical makes any night a better night :] 
Josh Peck's pastor talked about us in his sermon today . We must be special :] 
" True love does not come by finding the perfect person , but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly . " -Jason Jordan 
Is it May 15th yet ? 
If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world , who isn't perfect but is perfect for you , who works hard & would do anything for you , who makes you laugh & drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who takes care of you , who you want to grow old with , who you are thankful for everyday , & who you could not live without ... then brag about him a little & re-post . <3 Josh Peck 
WAHHHH I wanna learn Italian . Really badly . 
I guess I owe ASP for all my happiness :] 
Having a lot of fun changing my embouchure and opening up my sound . There are so many colors I've never heard myself play before , this is great ! :D 
Next semester is going to SUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCK . 
Won't tell anybody how you turn my world around , won't tell anyone how your voice is my favorite sound . Baby , if I've got you , I don't need a parachute . You're gonna catch me if I fall down . <3 
If I could " like " Dr. Thomas ' top ten reasons to be in marching band email , I would . I would like it ten times . 
Happy Easter ! He is risen indeed ! <3 
Dear A Very Potter Sequel , 
Please stop being addicting . Finals are soon .. 
Love , me . 
For once , I'm not glad that it's almost Friday .. 
Watching a Disney movie will totally take things off my mind . 
Very , very homesick . 
It's Harry Potter Day ! :D 
May the 4th ( Be with You ): Intergalactic Star Wars Day !! :D 
Wahhhh ... there's a second flute position open for the New York Philharmonic , but the deadline already passed for applications .. :[ 
My day has officially been ruined . More like my life is falling apart . 
Pre-May 8th : My mom has been the most supportive figure in my life . No matter what I get myself into , she has always been there to help me deal . She always listens to what I have to say . I don't know if she realizes , but when she says , " I love you baby girl , " it makes getting through the day so much easier . Without her , I don't know where I would be in life . I surely wouldn't have gotten this far . I love you , Mom . 
I'm not in it to win it , I'm in it for you . <3 
I love Mary Johnson Fuller very , very much . Can't wait to see you when I get home . <3 
To the flute camp girls of 2009 ( Shannon Lynn Vandzura , Lauren Anne Healey , Justine Stephens ): I just watched the DVD of our recital that year , and at the end of Air , we " bowed to the master " aka Jerry and Esma . Remember that ? It made me smile . :] 
I miss Sarah Shulman and Josh Peck like no other . I cannot wait to go home . Finals week , get outta here . No one likes you .
