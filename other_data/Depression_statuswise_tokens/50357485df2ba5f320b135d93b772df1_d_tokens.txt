“When I say , " I love you , " it's not because I want you or because I can't have you . It has nothing to do with me . I love what you are , what you do , how you try . I've seen your kindness and your strength . I've seen the best and the worst of you . And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are . You're a hell of a woman . ” ~ Joss Whedon 
There's not a lot for you to give if you're giving in And there's not a lot for you to feel if you're not feeling it You bring it up and bring it in and we'll get you fixed up in no time Cause this love is all I have to give

Hello . 
This is a Facebook status update . As you continue to read you will soon 
find out that this has nothing to do with anything unless you think 
pointless things are relevant to something . I have wasted your precious 
seconds of life .

I'd like to watch Spider Man while eating Ritz crackers covered with cheddar cheese ^3^ 
There are people who are just like you . They’re 
lonely . They’re missing somebody . They’re in love with someone they 
probably shouldn’t be in love with . They have secrets you wouldn’t 
believe . They wish , they dream , they hope . You could tell them everything & they would understand . And right now , they’re sitting here reading these words , & I’m writing this for you so you don’t feel alone anymore . 
" ... I 
pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end . Shortly after 
taking office , I announced our new strategy for Iraq and for a 
transition to full Iraqi responsibility . And I made it clear that by 
August 31st , 2010 , America's combat mission in Iraq would end . And that 
is exactly what we are doing -- as promised and on schedule . " -
