When I was a kid I didn't have a computer , cell phone , Nintendo DS , XBox , or Wii . I had Hot Wheels , a bike , ball & bat , a basketball . If I didn't eat what my mom made , I didn't eat . And I dealt with it . I didn't think of telling my parents " no " or dare to talk back and or got in BIG TROUBLE if I did . Life wasn't hard , it was life .. And I survived .

as far as I know , the recorded number of mailbox attacks in the past very was extremely low ... mainly due to the fact that mailboxes don't move very fast .
