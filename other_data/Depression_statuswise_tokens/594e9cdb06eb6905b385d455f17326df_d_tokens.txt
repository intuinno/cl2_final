I must confess I never saw any beauty in her face . Her features are not at all handsome . Her complexion has no brilliancy ! Her teeth are tolerable I suppose , but nothing out of the common way . And as for her eyes , which I have sometimes heard called fine , I could never perceive anything extraordinary in them ! And in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion which I find intolerable . 
can't wait for Mum's cooking !! Mmmmmm ... 
wants to hang , draw and quarter political science essays ! 
went on four buses today , but only had to pay for one ! :D 
" You are too hasty , sir , " she cried . " You forget that I have made no answer ... I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr Collins with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ... " 
is wishing that she didn't have so much study to do ! 
is really scared of taking the taxi tonight !!! =/ 
is VERY happy because she just finished her politics essay that is due on Tuesday ! :D

thinks chocolate is awesome comfort food ... mmmmmm 
" When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; ... because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit a would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . " 
just came home from her cousin's Michael Jackson-Rand and Eve Jackson-Rand's house and a delicious lunch . It's soooo nice to have home-cooked food ! Mmmm ... 
finally had something that could be called ' salad ' for dinner ! Mmmmmmmm ... FINALLY !

Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest . It seemed that Dernhelm laughed , and the clear voice was like the ring of steel . ' But no living man am I ! You look upon a woman ! Eowyn I am , Eomund's daughter . You stand between me and my lord and kin . Begone , if you be not deathless ! For living or dark undead , I will smite you if you touch him . '

Fawlty , remember ? The poor sod you do jobs for . So how are things your 
end ? Ah , splendid . Now how would you like to hear how things are my end ? 
Oh , well , up to your usual standard I think the odd hole in the wall ,

" You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " 
" You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . "

" From the very beginning from the first moment , I may almost say of my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , ... I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " 
needs chocolate . :( 
Cadbury's Turkish Delight Chocolate ! Mmmmm ... 
loved Dido and Aeneas ! Well done Veronica Jane ' Duckie ' Milroy !! 
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy ! That he should have been in love with her for so many months ! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , ...  was almost incredible ! 
Those who matter don't mind , and those who mind don't matter . 
~ Bernard Baruch 
bought a box set of Beethoven's 9 Symphonies performed by the Berlin Philharmoniker with Herbert von Karajan !! :D 
Nooooo ! Roger Federer , you disappoint me ! :'( 
Mr Bingley : I know this is all very untoward , but i would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet ... alone .

-2005 movie adaptation of Pride and Prejudice

The world is indeed full of peril and in 
it there are many dark places , but still there is much that is fair ; and 
though in all lands love is now mingled with grief , it still grows , 
perhaps , the greater . ( J . R . R . Tolkien ) 
When the verb of the relative clause is in a compound tense conjugated with ' etre ' , the past participle agrees with the relative pronoun ' qui ' because ' qui ' is the subject of the verb in the relative clause . The antecedent determines the gender and number of ' qui ' . :( 
Looking forward to a DELICIOUS lunch of awesome green salad ( with fetta and olives ) , potato salad , beetroot salad , and cold turkey , with pavlova for dessert !! :D

For my part , I must confess , I never saw any beauty in her 
face . Her features are not at all handsome . Her complexion has no brilliancy . Her teeth are tolerable , I suppose , but nothing out of the 
common way . And as for her eyes , which I have sometimes heard called fine ,

wants chocolate . 
Aimee Desailly , you are my HERO !! <3 
I just finished hanging gingerbread cookies on our REAL Christmas tree ! The smell is sooo good ! German-style Christmas is unbeatable ! German food is awesome .... 
This is my last day of being a teenager !! :'( 
" Yes , I did . That was only when I first knew her . For it has been many months now I have considered her one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance ! " 
When we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find 
her a reputed beauty ! I particularly recall you , Mr Darcy , one night 
after they had been dining at Netherfield , saying : " She a beauty ? I 
should as soon call her mother a wit ! " But afterwards she seemed to 
improve on you . 
I even believe you thought her rather pretty at one 
time . 
Esther is the awesomest person in the world - I just can't explain how great she is !!! She is my hero !!! <3 <3 
GO FEDERER !!! 
It's going to be a stressful night ! Go Federer !! 
But as for me , I shall sing of Your strength ; 
Yes , I shall joyfully sing of Your lovingkindness in the morning , 
For You have been my stronghold 
And a refuge in the day of my distress . 
O my strength , I will sing praises to You ; 
For God is my stronghold , the God who shows me lovingkindness . 
Psalm 59:16 -17 
just bought a car !! :D 
can't believe she has the a sister as awesome as Esther !!!! 
See from His head , His hands , His feet , 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down ! 
Did eer such love and sorrow meet , 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown ?
