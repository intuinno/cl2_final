I got a baby sheep today .... i named him Haggis , pray he survives the night ... 
why is it that every time oi eat a chocolate cookie i get the random urge to sing " mitse hid lik " 
" That could be me " 
I've never awoke in the dead of night , 
to hear screams of pain and fright 
The fear that i feel when i'm no longer free 
I think to myself " That could be me " 

I hide in the courner to run from the pain 
My screams are masked by the falling rain 
The bruises i hide from the eyes that i see 
I think to myself " That could be me . " 
I , too , have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought ... and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . <3 
Heh heh .... therers nobody online at 6 am on a saturday morning ..... 
believes in JESUS CHRIST and has accepted Him as my personal SAVIOR . One FB'er has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says , " If you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my father at the gates of Heaven . " This is simple ... if you love GOD and you are not afraid to show it ... re post this . No shame here , No show , No notice . HE IS MY SAVIOR
