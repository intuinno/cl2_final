LOVE THESE WORDS from a friends facebook Thanks Phillip Our lives are not determined by what happens to us but by how we react to what happens , not by what life brings to us , but by the attitude we bring to life . A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts , events , and outcomes . It is a catalyst , a spark that creates extraordinary results or ----------

The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen . Just listen . Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention .... A loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the most well-intentioned words . 
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us . Be all that you can be !! 
Shame on Canada ! We have our own people on the streets ; our unemployed are having to choose between if they will eat or pay the rent ; our food banks are empty ; our children are without a home ; Yet our government is doing more for Haiti then for their own country ! 99% of the people ... won't have the guts ... to copy and paste this .... are you 1%

The Eight of Chalices card suggests that my power today lies in space . I am true to myself and will only regret the chances I don't take to seek or follow my hearts desire . I turn away from or make a clean sweep of that which does not honor or sustain my passion and love , and in this , I am not afraid to be alone . I am empowered to move forward or make space and my gift is letting go .

What is the purpose of exploring a new path ? It is to experience a moment , a purpose or even perhaps a lifetime that is greater than what is available in the current reality or experience . It is to be in choice regarding one's reality and experience into the NEW YEAR WE GO !!!!

message for you is whatever situation you find yourself in , ask , ' Who has it worse than I ? ' Then pray for that person(s ) and even consider how you might help their situation or lend some encouragement . It'll make your plight seem much more bearable . 
In a world filled with natural disasters , violence , and bad news , people may ask , ' How can there be a God ? ' But rather , so much of these unfortunate situations are the result of society trying to push God out . Where is God ? He's waiting to be welcomed back in today , and to heal a hurting world . I love this one !!! 
it's not about who acts true 2 Ur face it's about who remains true behind Ur back . I realise who matters , who never did , & never will again & I'm not sad . 
" Being happy is the cornerstone of all that you are ! Nothing is more important than that you feel good . And you have absolute and utter control about that because you can choose the thought that makes you worry or the thought that makes you happy ; the things that thrill you , or the things that worry you . You have the choice in every moment . "

While you SCREAM at your Woman , there's a man 
wishing he could talk softly in her ear . While you HUMILATE , OFFEND &

could make love to her . While you make your Woman CRY , there's a man 
stealing smiles from her . Post this on your status if you are against

Life will always throw you obstacles but how strong you are will determine if you fall & stay down or trip & keep running . I choose to trip and keep running . 
we are never given more than we can handle breath in breath out u can do it ! @ !! 
may not be 
the most beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I 
might not be everyone's first choice , but I'm a great choice . I don't 
pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm good at being me . I might not 
be proud of some of the things I've done in the past , ... but 
I'm ... proud of who I am today ! Take ... ... me as I am or watch me as I walk away ! Post this if you're proud of being you 
A 
word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of 
praise after success a frigging man positive is always best . 
It is true what they say ... When you let go and move on , an inner peace and calm take over . Embrace it ! 
Remember , life is not just about surviving the storm ... It's about learning to dance in the rain even when things are pouring down around you ! " 
" Life is not measured by the number of breaths you take ... But rather by the number of moments that take your breath away " Happy New Years everyone may 2010 go out with a bang and 2011 come with great rewards !!

" It's not what you do ... its how you do it . 
Its not what you see ... its how you look at it . 
Its not how your life is ... its how you live it " 
WHAT IS ONE THING YOU REGRET IN YOUR LIFE ?

.. I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this .... in the status of all my friends . 
If we will but follow this voice of intuition , it will speak clearly and plainly . When we recognize that we are the individualized power of Infinite Spirit and that nothing outside of this has any power at all then we enter upon the road to true education , and all the mysteries that before were closed now reveal themselves .
