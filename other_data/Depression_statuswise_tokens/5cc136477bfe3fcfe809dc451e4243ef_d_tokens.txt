Life is not tried it is merely survived when your standing outside the fire .

Life is good I have halo 
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... 
Looks to be another restless four hour night before work .... 
What's a guy gotta do 
The time is rapidly aproching when all of the lie to your face , smile while your looking , sorry excuses for human beings that would rather try and destroy someone for trying to be happy in this world we are stuck in will face retribution for their actions , and their judgement will be final and everlasting 
Getting my workout on ! 
Its almost 5am and its time for bed 
F it , I'm going to bed 
Wants travel at the speed of light just to see what its like 
Why so serious ? Let's just have fun with it . I mean , it is the only one we get . 
Those who I surrornd myself with must learn to live to a higher morallity and remain vigilante in these convictions ... 
And now we wait 
Watching shutter island for the second time , so far knowing the ending isn't helping 
When life gives me lemons , I make orange juice . 
So as I lay dying , trapt , in this moment as the shadows fall around me and my senses fail I swear I shall be avenged sevenfold . This , truly , will be a day to remember . 
thinks its going to be a fun evening 
If my heart could sing it would sound like Gary Allan 
Academy starts in an hour and a half ! 
What mysterious powers are at work when you finally fall asleep only to wake up for some random reason like an hour later and then can't sleep anymore ... 
Restringing a guitar takes for years ... 
Time for sleep 
If I go crazy then will you still call me superman ? 
My only day without plans this week , what to do ... 
I seem to have misplaced my ability to sleep , if you find it please let me know . 
Its funny how when 1 good thing and 1 bad thing happen they don't eqaul out ... 
Not even 9pm and I'm ready for bed ... 
There needs to be more of a nightlife on this mountain ...

The beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair . 
Time to get this show on the road . 
Made it to Tucson , found the place I'm going in the morning and am now at the home of Mr. Stockton . 
0530 am , on the road . Gonna stop and get some water . Here we go ! 
I'm burning for you , burning , like a candle . 
Been playing BlackOps on the ps3 at the Ko Ton residence and , yeah , I need to get this game . 
I'm not the one who wants to hurt you . 
Finally awake and ready to get moving . Going to get all together then I'm on my way to Phoenix 
Good stay in Tucson . Didn't go exactly the way I wanted but got to hang out with an old friend and meet a couple of new ones . But now I'm on the road again . 
In Scottsdale , at my grandmas house . Probably here till Wednesday . 
If someone asked me what I wanted , right now my answer would be : I want you , to tell me that you want to see me , to tell me you want me to hold you safe in my embrace , to make me feel that feeling I can only get when I see your face . My answer would be , I want you . 
I know 2 adresses here in the valley and you , Google Maps , are wrong . I know what's at that adress and it is definitely not what I'm looking for . 
Waking up in Phoenix feels like the first few minutes after being hit by a truck . 
Yeah , I'm at a baseball game 
Going to take care of a couple things after the game . Then I'm just going to go exploring . Maybe try and get lost , with a gps ... 
Attention everyone currently on the 101 south bound ; would you kindly fuck off 
This is we and we are the night people 
Feeling good after a run . Heading across town to explore . Someone text me ^_^ 
I think I need to go back to the mountain to get my xbox and quit my job then just move down here 
Up at 0430 am and getting ready to drive to the testing site . 
I realize now I forgot my sunglasses this morning 
You know who you are and you know what you did . Its never to late to change it but , I'll never forget it . 
I'm hip-hop baby 
Go ahead , take a chance . I'm waiting for you to see that it may not be perfect but its worth a shot . Come on girl let's give it all we got . 
So , tired ; brain , not working . Need sleep but don't want sleep . Good day . Somebody hug me ... 
Getting ready to leave the valley . 
Some people are happy to be home from a long trip I can officially count myself among those who are not . 
In 1 hour its going to be 3/03 . The single most epic day of the year . 
Has issues ... 
Is at one of those points where you just feel like your entire life is boring the hell out of you . Not sure what to do about it at this point . 
" I'm the man and everbody out there knows that I'm the baddest " -HU4L 
Dear world ; I <3 you 
I greatly enjoy working out I would , however , enjoy it even more if someone would go with me . 
Is so bored . This job is going to kill me with bordem . 
Merry Christmas facebook people 
Well , suns coming up . Time to go home and try to get some sleep . 
Today it is man vs metal . I take on the gym to see who shall reign supreme . P.S. wtb more protein ... 
Yep I'm awake . Don't know why . But I am 
Lost in stereo 
When all you can do is make it from today to tomorrow making it to tomorrow is the hardest thing you can do . 
Where am I and who are you ? 
Wanted to put something fitting but honestly I think Lost in Stereo pretty much covers it . So , Lost In Stereo . 
" You built a time machine out of a delorean ? " 
You only get one shot ... 
I feel like a monster . The good kind that is . 
O sht y'all I think they forgot about Dre ! 
Honestly , what is the worst that could happen ? 
I can't lie ; I'm feeling a little bit country . 
It ain't nothing but a g thang baby 
While perfection may very well be a goal that is well beyond the reach of any human that doesn't mean that I'm not going to strive to achieve it in every way . You show me a person that is 100% content with every aspect of their life and I'll show you a person that will never know true happiness . 
Sum beach ... 
Hahaha , yeah . 
15 reps at 340 . We going up from here .

The reasons for the misunderstandings , the emergency landings on a plane headed for home .

Sometimes i feel lke I'm the only one that listens when i speak 
Shoot to thrill !

Sleep is for the weak ! 
" You take a mortal man , and put him in control . " 
I'm just trying to find my Ramona ... 
I definitely need something to do .... 
Whenever people do stupid things and get themselves in trouble all I can do is laugh 
Tron Legacy this weekend ! 
Not having a good holiday currently 
Whats the deal with purple , seriously ? 
Up down bacwards purple orange music is the source of life on earth . 
If I'm going to make this happen I need to get my shit together and make it happen 
the #1 deciding factor in a battle against a world-searing universe-spanning monster of nightmare and death is gumption . Everything else is just window dressing . 
What is this from ? 
Bears , Steelers , Superbowl 45 
For what evil truly lurks in the hearts of man ? 
Life is : love , loss , happiness and sorrow . Life is comedy and tragedy and it is all of these things over the course of the day ... 
Definitely needs a haircut ... 
Perhaps if I were to stop looking for it , it would come to me . However I want it so badly I'm afraid I can never stop . 
" You've had some of the best times you'll never remember with me ... " 
Today , San Diego , you have disappointed me ... 
Patience is a virtue , unfortunately its the most valuable one which is why there is so little of it 
Got a new game and a 12 pack , of pepsi ... set for a couple days at least 
Here's to the good times , they were good . To the hard times that we shared . You'll never know how much I cared . But now you've left and gone away and I'm finally ready to begin my new day . 
The fire that burns eternally . 
I <3 geometry 
Best part of new years is obviously fireworks 
ok NOW I'm tired . p.s. Six days till TRON 
1.5 miles , 13:00 minutes , soul crushing defeat . Next 2 weeks are going to be intense ... 
Gg broncos you can go freeze in Denver now 
Like you mean it 
If I sleep then I must wake and when I wake I would know if this were just a dream , so for this I must not sleep lest these sweet dreams desert me 
I think its time to blow this scene , get everybody and the stuff together ... 
Its gonna be a blast ! From the past ! 
I can ride MY bike with NO HANDLEBARS !! 
I don't really know what's going on right now , not sure how I'm going to deal with this , hit me like a ton of bricks ... 
The long road to ruin 
Like a good man once said , " when the sun goes down ... " 
As we travel down this road called life all we can really hope for is that we made an impression on the right people at the right time , and ultimately we hope to impress someone enough that they travel with us . 
Life is hard and there's no such thing as fair . Even so , a country boy can survive . 
They say I'm the man when I'm really a thundercat 
It hurts sooo , good ? 
Not currently positive the sun is coming up tomorrow 
There has to be some way to be completly happy . Or at least to have the things that make you feel complete at the same time ... 
Thinking of you ... 
If the world were to end tomorrow , would you be mine today ? 
I can hear you , alone in the dark , and I've come to tell you . Don't be afraid , come take my hand and I will show you the way . 
I'm sick of this shit , I need an opening , a door to stick my foot in just something to get it all started ... 
Girl , its just you me and the moon . Whatever shall we do ? 
All in all a good day . Need the next month to go by fast though :) 
Today my boy Brian Urlacher is gonna put the hurt on someone 
Valentines day , just an excuse to eat far to much chocolate . 
The sun may not always shine on you , life may knock you down and people may leave you in the cold but I will always be there with a candle , a hand , and a blanket . 
After an extremly long and even more amazing weekend its back to the routine .
