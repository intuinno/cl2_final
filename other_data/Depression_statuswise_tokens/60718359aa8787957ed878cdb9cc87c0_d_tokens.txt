From not using my cell phone hardly , to recently being active on it . Forgot it at home today and actually feeling the loss of it lol . Go figure :P 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , I have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's a$$ . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
I am my worst critic when I don't have to be since if I can't trust words from people I trust ... I'm doomed . And I agree with words from a wise and very sexy person ( who has great taste in women and doesn't wear polka-dots :P ) once said I think I'm worth the risk too . Thanks for being there/here . Thanks to all my friends . 
Just got approved for an apartment I applied for ... effective 4/15 ... well after I sign the lease that's getting drawn up now ... the waiting wasn't too bad .. the worst is yet to come .... packing all my stuff and moving it to the new place will be worse than the waiting lol . 
Just got informed my monthly rent will be $61 less a month than I was expecting ... guess it slides per income .. or rent went down . Guess that's going towards electric bill since water is included with rent , no need for cable or landline .

Semi-afk packing and cleaning a bit . Can't hear cause I won't have my headphones one but I'll check my comp later . 
Did my address change online for stuff and car insurance is gonna go down about $80/yr cause I'm closer to work now . I feel like an ad .. I'm saving $X on car insurance :P 
We all have at least 60 friends on facebook ; but when it comes to needing someone to talk to , how many will actually be there for you ?
