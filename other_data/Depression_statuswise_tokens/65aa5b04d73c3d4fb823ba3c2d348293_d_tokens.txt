Im ecstatic ! 
LOVE , Live , Laugh 
When ... i ask ? Impatience is a flaw i wish i could simply get over and forget i ever had like a " boo-boo " my mommy can kiss ... Sure life is great ... And I'm definitely not ready to grow up ... But its as if time has stopped just to point and mock me ... I laugh , i cry , i work my hardest but still it ticks and tocks in the slowest of all manners . When ... i ask ?? 
Ok , seriously , can you say best night ever ? Tonite was amazing !!! Have to admit even driving there was freaking awesome !!! 
I'll deny it but i see what's going on here . :)

I may regret things in the moment but looking back now .. I wouldn't change a single thing about my life . Pull out the old photo book and you realize how perfect you really have it .. How lucky can one person be ?? :D 
BS of the day : Treat others how you want to be treated and they will do the same for you .. or how ever that dumb butt saying goes ... Don't work !! Im sorry but when the heck did curtsy get rudely thrown out the window and why was i not informed ????

i wanna no who made up the rules on beauty .... who stood two different people side by side and said one was beautiful and one was ugly ? who has that power ?? :) No one ! So the day you feel like judging me will be the same day you feel the power of my fist to your face . 
Tired ! So tired ! lol . 
Ok so tell me .... How can life be any better ? Maybe if time stopped in this one moment and stayed ? Impossible but it would be lovely .... Lol . Living to love and loving to live , and only a few can ruin it . Ya'all just stay away . =D 
Now i really do wish time could have stopped .... Turns out I'm my own worst enemy .... Who knew . 
Got fake nails for the first time today . Dark red !! Lol . Hope they stay on for skewl . 
Good break from school ! Just saying .. May be one of my best . :)

Days like this suck . I wake up at 10 when all i want is for it to be 5 in the afternoon or later . I want this day over and i want this mood gone . Life is tormenting me .
