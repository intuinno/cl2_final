" wo kya dost jinhe apne dost par yakin na ho , 
wo kya dost jinhe dost ki baaton ko sun na bhi na ho , 
dusron ki baat sun kar jo dost par vishvaas karna chod de , 
aur apne dost k sach ko bhi kaagaj ki tarah marod de , 
jaa-e-dost ek din tujhe sach khud pata chal jaayega , 
lekin kya pata tab tak itni der ho chuki ho , ki tera ye dost apni dosti wapis nahi de payega ... "

IF YOU BORN POOR 
IT’S NOT YOUR MISTAKE 
BUT IF U DIES POOR , IT’S YOUR MISTAKE . 
BORN WITH PERSONALITY , IT’S AN ACCIDENT 
BUT DYING IN A PERSONALITY IS AN ACHIEVEMENT . 
YOUR BIRTH MAY BE NORMAL 
BUT YOUR DEATH SHOULD BE HISTORY . 
DO OR DIE IS AN OLD CONCEPT 
BUT DO BEFORE U DIE IS NEW CONCEPT 
bye fb , 
c u after 28 feb . 
I hate this feeling of displacement , 
Not knowing where I'm headed . 
Not knowing how to react . 
Heading to a place that I have created . 
Slice open , 
The pain held inside . 
And let it slip away . 
Every night that I have cried . 
Let the blood drop , 
Let it all slip away . 
Let life slowly stop , 
This life of disarray ...

kisi k paas faltu speakers hon .. 
to contact me .... 
Dream visit us when we are asleep .. 
but .. 
GOD is so wise , 
he wakes us up each day

gives us every chance to make our dream come true ... 
Home is so boring ...

Some times SILENCE 
is the best way 2 answer .... 
If the other person knows u well enough ...

Science Kahta hai " Jeebh pe lagi chot sabse jaldi theek hoti hai hai . " 
Aur Gyan Kahata hai " Jeebh se lagi chot kabhi theek nahi hoti .. "

If a person is silent .. 
it doesn't mean that he is unknown of fun , thrills and colours of life .. 
instead it means that .. 
life has taught him some lessons which have made him silent .. 
and those lessons are termed as ' experience ' ..!! 
bye - bye facebook ..

" An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field . " 
Niels Bohr 
Terrorism is a complex phenomenon . 
The term terrorism has been interpreted in several ways . Ironically though , the global community hasn’t yet reached on a consensus as to the definition of terrorism . 
Yonah Alexander defines terrorism as “The use or threat of violence against random or civilian targets in order to intimidate or to create generalized pervasive fear for the purpose of achieving political goals , ”

Its when we stop TRYING to understand our friends .. 
Its then we start LOOSING them .. 
All of us have thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to overcome cancer . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or ... is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour ...
