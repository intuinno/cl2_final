The weather is very nice out today . It's days like these that make me wish I still had a working bicycle . (¬ ¬) Meow . 
I'm guessing that this is because of the abnormal hour it is right now , but at the moment , nearly all the popular quizzes on Quiz Monster just so happen to be in German . (><) Funny stuff .

While at the funeral of her own mother , a girl met a guy whom she did not know . She thought this guy was amazing , the dream guy that she was searching for , and fell in love with him immediately . She never asked for his name or number and afterward could not find anyone who knew who he was . A few days later the girl killed her own sister . Why did she kill her sister ?

Every night I crawl into bed exhausted , wanna pass out but can't , end up on my comp or doing something of other , and regret it in the morning . 
Midnight always seems to roll around the corner so much more quickly than expected , does it not ?

Sick of having amazingly out of the ordinary dreams and then not being able to remember the details after waking up .

We'll work on that then . ~ Remember dreams . Good luck ! 
I think I'll go bed and take my pills now , have another nightmare tonight and wake up in the morning going , " Well that was weird . " Routines .
