Out of school for now . Hopefully only have a week left . I might have to stay over time to finish though . 
PLEASE TAKE NOTE - apparantly the whole changing your profile picture to your favourite cartoon chatacter thing was actually created by a group of pedophiles , because if children see pictures of cartoons they will add them , it was currently on the programme Internet frauds and will apparently be on tv some time tonight ..., put this as your status to warn people and change your profile pictures back 
I love always staying out all night and just showing up at 4-5am . Makes me feel like a teenager .

Already Christmas eve , Why Holidays , why must you impede my advance at getting a life . 
Just Got Tickets for TRON : Legacy IMAX 3D on Friday , EPIC ! I am Pumped . First 3D and IMAX Movie , AND IT'S TRON ! You can't beat that shit . It's going to be so epic . It makes me want to /faceroll just thinking about it ! 
Well , took the test . Right before I took it i found out i was Exempt from half of it , so that's always nice . Passed Elementary Algebra with flying colors . Passed the computer skills thing . Failed one ... College Algebra . Course it also ends up everyone in my family that took that portion failed it as well . 
On another note , I am sick like there's no tomorrow . ¬.¬ It sucks pretty bad . I might not be able to go to school tomorrow . I hope I can . I got work to do . 
I just found out my step-uncle died ... This sucks . 
Still got the coughs , but my sniffles are gone . So , I am still somewhat sick I guess . But oh well . 
Wish me luck , going to take the Accuplacer . 
Techno is the pure embodiment of music , as it was meant to be . A combination of the soul and feelings , compressed in to sound , and blasted through speakers . No instruments are needed , as Instruments only limit the sounds one can produce . Techno , is my shit .
