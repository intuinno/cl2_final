" You were only given this life because you are strong enough to live it . " 
is enjoying talking as if she were an immensely educated individual . If all of humanity were to speak this way , the world would be far more enjoyable . 
Be off to sleep , my loves , for the night is calling you . Did you know that yesterday morning each of your spines grew ? Something about the pressures of walking , and things of that sort , but I hope you sleep VERY well , and do not end up in court ! I love you ?

Sometimes I wish everyone would just .. stop . That everyone would take a few minutes to shut up and listen . The only problem is that it doesn't seem as if that will be happening anytime soon . But maybe I'm too hard on humanity . Maybe we all still have at least a little bit of goodness in us . Maybe it is possible . Yes . It is possible . 
did her sleep study thing last night , and surprisingly , the wires weren't really uncomfortable . 
I wish everybody would come back already D: . Cause I miss them .. and stuff .. ): 
So , apparently well groomed horses look like unicorns . 
I'm really thankful for the ability to love and be loved right now . Just thought you should know . <3

I'm going to go to bed .. maybe ..... Depends on if anyone comments or messages . Then I'm happy to stay up . 
Listening to Sum 41 . Woopie . For real .

Dad and Ben are flying to Vegas today to get our new red Mustang convertible . Haha . That's actually very strange .

I think I don't want summer to end so much that my mind keeps telling me that tomorrow is not the last day and it's okay for me to sit around doing nothing , when in fact , it is not . HELP . 
I actually woke up before 2pm today . Yessssss . 
WEEKEND 
Lalalalala . I don't really know what to put here .. (: 
You all fail to excite me . 
Going offline . Expecting to find about 19837593487523984 email notifications when she comes back on . Thank you . 
My crazy cool essay moment has passed . So here I am . On facebook o.o 
I'm just sitting in my room right now . On the laptop . Doing nothing . Fun . 
I GAVE UP . Turns out it's not possible for me to concentrate right now .. the solution : Facebook . 
Summer , Summer , please don't go . I will miss you so very so . It is a shame my name isn't Moe , cause there's not much else that ends with O . 
Logging off , but I have my phone . Communicate ? 
Hmmmmmm .. 
Facebook thinks I'm a dude . Life is so unfair . 
" i think won't like him ( christian Bale ) if I get to know him though he seems like an aggravating person why ? Men can be beautiful my profile picture what picture is that ? well it does ! it looks like a fake person's smile " -Abby what are you even saying ? 
I should probably do something today seeing as it is the last day of summer .. but I'll most likely just sit on my bed the whole day staring blankly at my computer screen . Sounds so fun . JUST KIDDING- it's sounds like one of the most boring things possible . I don't want summer to end , but at the moment it looks like a much better thing to be learning than doing this . AHHHHHHHHH . 
SUMMER SCHOOL IS OVER ... but I still have to read 345763 books and write 345763 essays ): ... But I /AM/ coming to the commons tonight . My mom told me that I should try to have a social life . 
gets to sleep in tomorrow . Yay for Saturdays . 
Mmmmm .. not so great right now . |= AGAIN . 
I did absolutely nothing today . I feel like a .. I'd say potato , but it's so overused . Bleh . 
hmmmm 
SUBWAY . eatfresshhh 
School time . Wow . I'm up early . 
School wasn't all that bad today , but block schedule is messing with my sense of time . Yay ? Yes , yay indeed . 
I'd go to sleep , but I have this problem with not finishing my homework until around 10pm . 
First day .. It was okay . I didn't get lost , which is a plus , but I have almost no friends in any of my classes : None in 3 of them and only one or two in the other three . I'll live- High school is all about meeting new people , right ? Well , besides achieving academic excellence and all of that stuff . Oh , and I get my ribs looked at today (: . They've been hurting more than ever ): .

I wanted summer to end even before it even started .. but now that it's almost gone , I don't want it to end . 
I remember way back when when some annoying neighbor of mine made fun of me because I called dinner supper . He said I was such a humble person . I didn't know what humble meant .. so I started crying . And that is my story for today . Dinner/Supper- be back soon .

HOMEWORK TIME , but I need ways to procrastinate .. text ? Thank you . 
Campout tiiiiime . Even though I'm not camping out .. my sleep is " too fragile . " Oh , well . I'll still be able to spend today acting like a complete idiot without being judged . Well , I may be judged , but I'm pretty sure no one is going to tell me I am an idiot and to get out of their life . It's always a good thing when that doesn't happen . Uhmmmm .. so I'm leaving now . Clever facebook statuses can wait ... (:

I'll find out tomorrow what's up .. the doctor said my ribs were most likely bruised , which REALLY hurts , but she doesn't think they're broken .. and that's good , I guess . But either way , unless the issue is messing with my breathing/ internal organs , the only thing that they can do about it is to suggest I take ibuprofen . Wow . 
AHHHHH !!!!!! ( it's my birthday ... ) 
GOOD NIGHT . 
Campout was fun (: But now it's time for one of God's most precious gifts : SLEEP .

I know I shouldn't be this stressed about school .. but I am . Only two more days until the weekend .

Staying home is supposed to be easy , but I just feel sick and sneezy .

Have you ever wanted to be outside of yourself ? Or wondered what it's like to be someone else ? Have you woken up from a dream , so sweet , and wished that it would really be ? Have you ever longed to be set free , or away from things that are bad ? Has there ever been something you didn't do , that you wish you had ? Have you lived through the worst that you can imagine to be ? If so , you can guess what it's like to be me .

I'm so happy right now , and I can't help but smile . I haven't felt this great in a too long of a while . I'm seeing the silver lining on all the clouds overhead . Things are going so well- Something has to be said . There are people around me who care for my being , and are there to support me through anything . I hope that they know how much they mean to me , for finally , openly myself I can be . 
I'm about to punch my electricity in the face .

It's like the world is set on pause . And now my mind has started to stop . Racing thoughts disappear and on my cheeks hault the tears . Stop and rewind to back when I was happy . I'm starting to feel happy again . My heart has been opened , now I feel happy again . (: 
HAPPY WINTER BREAK ! & Alex Olivares is an amazing Santa -I'm obsessed with my new mini xylophone . ( It was made in Germany ) And fuzzy socks and Wooly Willy/Hair-do Harriet and AMAZING wallet . THANK YOU !

I can clearly imagine all of my teachers sitting in the teachers ' lounge planning out all their homework schedules so that I have 156 things due on the same day . 
And now I have an urge to bake cookies . So I am going to do so . And eat them ALL by myself . :D 
Dear Doctor Katz , you are my new favourite person . Love , Elizabeth . AKA the mystery of my wrist problems is solved . I have chronic tendonitis . Wow , that sounds lame . But yay ?

Nothing exciting is happening . Laammmmee . 
I've had 6 cookies . I don't know how many more I can handle . I guess I'll just have to hide them somewhere besides my stomach . 
I started playing my piano ( well , keyboard ) again today , and I don't understand why I ever stopped . My wrists are swollen and my fingers are sore . Oh , how I've missed that feeling . 
Today I've been reminded of how blessed I am . My family is supportive and loving and wonderful , and my friends are some of the best people there are . I love you guys , and I hope you have a wonderful 2010 ! <3
