Oh guess what !? I cooked dinner last night ! I know this is a big shock to those who know me very well . I made fajitas ! 
so far everything is looking good . Alton has an endoscopy ultrasound on Monday to see if there is any cancer still in the stomach and how deep it is . Dr said it looks like they may have gotten it all when removing the polyps . if there is cancer still there hoping it is just the first layer they will scrape the lining . so far no chemo or radiation . but he does want frequents checks on stomach just in case . 
Unfortunately most women won't re-post this : I'm strong-willed , independent , and outspoken , I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at MY BEST !

Didnt someone with the last name Tuma go to River City with us ? 
Reason I ask , while Alton was in the hospital this last week he had a roomie whose last name was Tuma . It sounds so familiar . Alton's roomie was about 65 or so . He didnt know of any Tuma's from West Sac . Just wondering .

Money can't buy happiness , but it sure makes misery easier to live with . 
Alton got call from GI dr. polps in stomach are not cancerous but have to be removed , ans there are white blood cells on bottom of stomach , so means his body is fighting infection just where . liver is still enflamed . gall bladder has precancerous cells , but wants to wait and do another ultrasound in about 5-6 months to see if it grows . Will find out the action plan Thursday when we see her . 
urgh . i just wanna go back to bed ! NO NO NO ! Want to do event ! Ok Im outta here or I will never be ready to leave . Glad I got my stuff ready last night , so now I just load the car ! Smart thinking ! 
I'm thinking Fall is here 
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car . 
I loved you the minute I knew I was pregnant . I loved you the second you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you & to this day I still would !! Put this on your status if you have children you love more ...... than ...... life ? 
Alton's surgery to remove his alien in his stomach is tomorrow morning ! They wont know the recovery time yet , until they go in . If they go through his throat it will be 2 days , if have to go through his abdomen it could be up to 4-6 weeks .

or my other option : 
paint myself and do some kind of routine on k street mall 
So after a week of worrying about what the ultrasound said , doctors not calling us back to say what was happening ...... 
Alton went to oncology appointment and the doctor didnt know why he was referred there . his ultrasounds were fine . THERE IS NO CANCER !!! 
There is a cyst and there is pain so he is referred to Pain Management . 
whoohooo !!! 
I like it on the kitchen table 
after months of an unhappy zoo , everyone is happy now !! whoohoo

So far so good . Waiting on call from doctor to schedule the removal of the polp in Alton's stomach , and will schedule another ultrasound in 3 months to see if the cells on the gall bladder get bigger . They will be going in thru his esophagus to remove the polp so recovery time wont be long , it will be an out-patient at UCD downtown just in case there is a problem . ( Breathing sigh of relief ) 
I am really needing the love from my friends today . Help me make it through . 
Today Alton got call from gastro doc for an appt on Tuesday . Still waiting for call from Urologist . Hmmm . Funny thing , our doctor called him after the gastro dr. Make sense ?
