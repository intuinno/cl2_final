" HOHOHOHO " 
Life is like a piano 
The white keys represent happiness 
The black keys show how dark the sadness 
But harmony between white and black keys create amazing music harmony the same with how beautiful life journey (: 
You never know how strong you are until to be strong the only option for you 
Meaning of real pain when the wing angel of death came to you .. not take you away but bring the people who the most important in your life and in your heart leave you alone with the suffering from open wounds that continued bleeding in your entire empty and dark life 
Left deep regret can't turn back time when happiness smelled fragrant flowers troughout the heart .. just memories and tears of blood remaining .
