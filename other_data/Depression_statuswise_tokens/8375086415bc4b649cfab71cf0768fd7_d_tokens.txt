isn't it amazing that we people often find ourselves watching animes , movies or teleseryes to be entertained . why do we do so ? may because it's the only source of escaping reality , a reality that is sometimes unbearable to conceive . i felt glad that through this opportunity i can grasp the situation in which i can go beyond the realm of limitations .? 
akward isn't it that i care too much about you and just now I confessed to you . I'm glad that i have told you . I think it is time to take my steps .
