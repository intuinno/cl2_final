Sometimes I lose hope . No lie . I'm no Angel , but I try to see the good in everything . Sometimes I can't . Sometimes my heart just wants to give up and turn to ash , but I won't allow it to . " Never Lose Hope , " I was once told by an Angelic friend . I shall not Lose Hope . Not now . Not ever . 
No need to make it up to me . If I do something for you without your asking for it , then know I do it from my heart . It knows no conditions for what it wants to give . Besides ... no friend of mine shall travel deep into the dark night of the soul without me . 
I have given and will continue to give my best , but no matter how hard I try , what I do or how I do it , you are never pleased . Is anything good enough ? =/ 
Dreams . Curious things of our minds . 
I've had enough . I love to give more than is expected of me , but holy shit , to the point that you use me and I receive nothing in return ? Fuck you . This stops now .
