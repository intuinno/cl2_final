really happy that i find " someone " before my oral exam .. meeting her and getting her to help me was the wisest choice i ever make .. cuz i was able to enter and leave the examination hall with ease .. ^.^ 
a great teacher not only teaches the student to do well but also inspire him/her to love the subject and strive to be a better person 
it is only when one is in desperate moment will they finally know who is their true friend .. and i am thankful for getting to know 3 most beloved friend .. YL , BR and PH 
since taking the initiative to talk to others yet they cant even be bothered about it .. why should i care ? i might as well just shut up and wait till they got things to tell me . or better yet leave them be !! 
i wanna give up O'level this year .. my motivation has vanish into thin air .. haizz 
i wonder do all the people deserves sympathy as they fall under the catergory of " humans " or only a certain group of people deserves it ?? 
recipes .. recipes .. i got a hard time finding recipes that fits my F&N practical criteria ! it is either too easy or the ingredients is hard to find/expensive !!! help ! 
just played and intense and bloody game today > left 4 dead 2.it is one hell of a game man ! it will be scary to play alone at night ! 
learn to accept things that does not go according to what we want . if we do not try to accept it , stress will increase . 
5 more months to o'levels .. 30 more days to MT o'level exam !! 1month and a half to o'level F&N practical exam !!!.... yet i am still daydreaming away ! 
lost my phone.so no point smsing me ! haha 
it is good to have an end to journey toward but it is the journey that matters , in the end 
have not finished my F&N coursework . but the more i do , the more i feel like giving up . the coaching itself have already made me suffered from headaches .. dont feel like doing it ! 
the feeling of loneliness is gnawing my heart .. at times , that feeling is unbearable , at times it was frozen up .. i hated that feeling .. 
kindness is what makes a human being , brittle . but it is also the same kindness that brings human beings together 
its funny that people claims that they know you well but in fact they dont . whats worse is that they didnt do any significant stuff for you and can forcefully claim that they are your best friend/good friend 
did not attend school today , but i knew very well who really care for me .. and i am happy .. ^.^ although it is only 1 person .. 
very very tired now .. but no matter the amount of sleeps i had , it wasnt enough .. 
if life is like the show " rhythm of life " i will go back to the past and change everything . 
who are you to judge me . what right do you even have to criticise me . look at your actions and behaviour before talking bad about others .. 
not a superstitious person but at times the horoscope is spot on . 
the first time and the first thing to appreciate what others do is to say thank you . the second time will be doing something nice in return .. 
was i wrong ? maybe .. but i must say ~ ~ daikira !! honto daikira !! haha 
Half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have rushed through life trying to save . -Rogers , Will 
despite telling myself that i should pick up the courage to meet that person , i am still hesitating !! gosh ! i tink there is high chance that i will not turn up at her office -.- mmph ... what should i do ?? 
why bother ? i have always given advice to many people but what i've said , they neither keep it in their mind or heart.so when they met with some obstacles , they will just turn around and blame me.so,why bother ? 
had fun today but was boring due to the lack of entertainment by the host .. after the fun time , i was wondering should i go out tomorrow ?? 
attitude is a small thing that makes a big difference ! 
i seriously dislike people who show off -.- wats the point of showing off when it is just a moment of success ? 
i wonder isit because i think that it is my problem and no one cares .. or isit simply because people just dont want to care as it is not their problem 
should i ?? should i not ?? gosh !! it is so troublesome !! help me solve it !!... nvm .. asking people to help = taking forever -.- 
i really dislike people who only ' saw ' me when they needed help and pretend that i dont exist when they are done with it . ( how many people are actually not like this ? ) 
i belongs to INFP kind of personality .. ^.^ 
i cant find the courage to face the examiner for the oral exam next tuesday ! shall i skip it ? >.< 
i wonder whether retaking chinese paper is a bad decision .. cuz the problems lies not with the paper but the oral itself .. if my oral had gotten a merit , i would have easily gotten a B for the overall chinese .. now .. i wonder ....... 
susan boyle is my greatest motivator . 
woahoo !! joanne peh and rui en won the most favorite actress award !! so happy for them !! i love them alot cuz they are the best among the 7 princesses !! 
globalisation notes ... globalisation notes .. please come out .. dont play hide and seek with me .... 
finally .. i am able to study !!! -.- i am not sure what force is pushing me forward but .. the most important thing is that i nid to use determination/commitment to make it successful .. if not i am back to being a lazy and slackish person .. 
Our greatest battles are that with our own minds . -Jameson Frank 
hope that this SA1 ends quickly . everyday , the paper gets harder and harder !! 
they based on one test to judge us which is very unfair .. hate banding the most .. what are we going to learn when we are used to another method of learning and suddenly all change ?? 
just created a new blog . but it serve the purpose of introducing and explaining about certain anime . 
today is my doom's day ! i told the examiner i got nothing else to say for 3/4 times sia !! so dead .. plus she repeat and rephrase what i said sia !! walao !! 
i don't get one thing . why do people complained about others being inconsiderate yet , they themselves are one ??? 
it is said that the result will be released around 10 ~ 12 jan ... i wonder isit true ... 
i sit down , stare at my book for less then 5 mins and i am back to my laptop ! 
despite knowing my limit in ability to archieve distinction for chinese , i will still aim high for it .. because the result will always fall below my target .. must chiong for chinese !! i am much more weaker in that subject than anyone else ! 
another year in school is not always a good thing .. the bad thing is that we have to go through the same procedure for another year , thus we all will feel sian about it .. right now , everyone is feeling tired of F&N .. no one is doing coursework but playing facebook or blog shopping 
one has to try not to make mistake as making up for it may be impossible .. 
imitation . that is what clowns are good at . 
what can we do about F&N when we put in so much effort and when our work come back to us .. it is being rejected or 99% of it was being erased off .. where , when , how can we find our motivation to continue on with our F&N ?? 
just a little more .. just add 100% effort in .. just strive on and not stop to slack .. my little motivator to keep me going .. so that i will be prepared for Olevels ..

Having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words , but pouring them all right out , just as they are , chaff and grain together ; certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them , keep what is worth keeping , and then with the breath of kindness blow the rest away . - a quote by Dinah Craik 
so not going to sch for the rest of my holiday , be it MT oral practice or F&N coursework . just want to stay at home and really enjoy the rest of my holidays !! 
Those who know true love act with confidence , straightforwardness and honesty , 
whereas those who present themselves as nice are often merely hiding the 
... depths of their emotion behind a show of smiling appeasement . 
will not be affected by their words and actions .. i am alot stronger then i used to be .. i have overcome my biggest obstacles and now .. i should place all my efforts and thought on another issues .. which is Olevels .. 
who are you to judge me ??!! you cant even be bothered to apologize when you are at wrong !! dont expect me to be kind towards you , cuz you dont deserve it .. 
is there a need to be attitude towards others when the most obvious thing is that you , yourself are the one at wrong ?? no longer a kid yet your actions shows that you are one . 
SUFFOCATING right now !!! plus irregular sleeps has made me very bad tempered !!! suffocating + headaches + tired + bad temper = unable to study !! 
the greatest time i ever spent was when i am with my cca members .. because i got caring seniors , 2 most beloved juniors and a bunch of wierd and crazy people ! the most important is that we've been through a series of scolding from teachers !! great memories !! 
i am such a movie freak !! watching movies after movies at home right now .. 
i seriously cant stand unorganized people and i cant stand last miunte stuff !!!! 
Offering one's left hand is a sign of trust for that person , as the left hand is the one that holds the shield(i . e . you trust that person enough to lower down your guard . ) it is also a sign of fraternity and lover , for the left side is where the heart resides . 
no countries should face natural disasters alone . because the root of the natural disaster is caused by global warming which is entirely due to human beings . 
i 
cant judge and force other to share the same view as i am . if i do not 
want to let the issue bugs me , i have to change my own thinking .. but at 
times i wonder .. why do i have to go through the pain to change myself so 
that i am able to mingle with others ??? why do i even have to accept 
their behaviour ????
