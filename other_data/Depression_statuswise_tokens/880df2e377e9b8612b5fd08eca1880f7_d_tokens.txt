Facebook suddenly has a whole new meaning post-Hellenistic World essay .... hmm ... would Friend requests from Antiochos be all the rage amongst the Macedonian elite ? Would Seleukos change his profile picture to exaggerate his Alexander-inspired features ?? WOULD THERE BE INANE FAN PAGES " 95% OF BABYLONIANS COULDN'T SEE THE PERSIAN INFLUENCE IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PALACE AT AI-KHANOUM lol ! 1 " ??? The mind boggles .
