Grr ! My glasses broke last weekend so they keep falling off >:( 
I'm getting really nervous about my biopsy coming up , i can just hear my family saying " ... Lindsea died in her biospy " :'( Pray for me ! 
! Scary Black Widow ( I think ) in the garage ! now everything i touch seems to be a scary nightmarish monster trying to kill me ! AHH 
I can't wait for Grand Assembly ! 
I survived my biopsy !! Even though they blew up two veins when they were trying to IV me :'( it hurt like crazy 
I really wish I hadn't looked at the McDonalds nutrition chart .... 1 McChicken has the same amount of trans fat as 3 Subway Footlongs . 
AAAAH ! Why am I picking out all of my eyelashes ?! I have about 10-20 BLOND eyelashes on each side :'( 
I love rain , but I want some sunny days T_T . 
I'm sick :'( 
Listing what animes I've seen makes me feel like a total nerd T_T 
Can't wait to get my new haircut tomorrow ~ And have a super awesome epic Harry Potter Marathon with Charlotte <3 
Finally got a new Facebook ! Never really did find out why my last one was disabled ... Sorry for the ugly webcam taken profile picture !
