making quizzes is confusing 
flying purple dog ! lol ! 
No one loves me on face book . :( 
Boo ! 
WAHHHHHHHH !!!!! RIP Robert Cordner , commonly known as my grandad . I am deeply upset and I need consolation ! 
Hrmmmmmmmm ....... I must be addicted to Linkin Park , I mean seriousky , I have 39 of their songs , and I listen to it most of the time .... 
there is nothing much on my mind , thankyou very much . 
bother 
goddamit , that was SUPPOSED to be a haiku . 
It's easier to run escape all the dead truths and find myself here 
We had a heart dissection in science on friday , and it really upset me , because had this vivid image of a heart stopping , and that reminded me of my grandad . I ran out of the room , crying my eyes out and sobbing loudly . 
I ams eatings a real big sammywitch . It is full of nummy things ! mmmmmmm 
My brain 
Hooray . Finally finished year 10 stage challenge . To Elise and evr1 else : Sorry . Thats it . 
if you ask me how i feel , I usually say ' I dunno ' but today , I'm really not sure . It's not like I was meditating at lunch again . but It's just wierd . Emotions are almost overrated unless they are needed . All I feel right now is love and well , I can't explain it . It's clear in my head , but not in my words . Nothing is really affecting me right now ... 
Where did you go ? 
When was the last time you appreciated someone you love ? well , you'd better start . you never know when they might go away forever 
If u people want me to add you on those wussy games like farmville and cafeworld , you'd better just accept my vampire wars invitation because I can't do anything until i have a bigger clan ! I'll come at you with my friggin ' vampiric claws if you're not careful ! 
It is new years eve and I am sitting in the study , eating my mcdonalds and getting ready to go back to my room to watch naruto . Best New Years Eve EVER ! 
I'm always getting caught in the crossfire ... 
It really hurts whn your friends don't tell you about their birthday parties and then you get told on the night and then your other friends are going and I wasnt even told . I feel like crying . The perpetrator is Maya Wilde , who could at least have told me that she could only invite so many people . : C 
Gah ! Christmas Cards hard ! 
found a TROLL in the dungeons , TROOOOOOOOOOOLL . Thought you ought to know . PS ERYN IS SO AWESOME . This is not a facebook hijack . Love from LEEELLEEEEE . ex oh ex oh . ERYN IS COOL . Prost . 
is it me or am I a facebook noob ? 
Why is the world so bloody unjust ???? 
Lillikaya is my real name . isn't that strange ...... 
Hello . I am really going insane ..... 
I got sunburnt . On my shoulders , and my back and every time I move or sit down I want to scream because my back rubs against the chair or my bed . Ow 
I just learnt how to do a major scale on an electric guitar without moving my hand . Don't I just rock ? 
I was watching Naruto Collection 13 and the guy who plays Sagi also voices Ichigo . WOO ! 
Ieyui Nobomenu Renmiri Yojuyogo Hasatekanae Kutamae 
okay , maybe i've changed my mind . 
I hate year eleven already . It is going to be a VERY slow year . 
I love vaelntines day ! it is so cute ! 
i'm never alone , as long as I have love in my heart and some sort of smile on my face 
I hate searching for weapon pieces . OFFICIALLY . 
Sigh . My ipod just went Spastic ! 
I swear I am addicted to Final Fantasy VIII . I'm looking up item locations for the final weapons and have been playing for over 30 hours in the last two days , from when I get up to going to sleep-it's crazy but I'm loving it because squall is Level 89 ! No wonder one of my nick names is Squallette . YAY ! 
thanks eryn , you're such a kind big sister . 
bangers and mash for tea , woop . 
Love is blind until it slaps you in the face with a large species of fish , or in my case , an awkward turtle 
Somewhere ... 
There's a place for us . 
Somewhere a place for us , peace and quiet and open air , wait for us somewhere . 
But the past is the past ... it's over , done with . 
Succumb to my hunger for the cerebral cortex ! 
I want to share my songs with the world . 
3 songs ready for youtube ! 
My daddy is from Paddington . 
He caught the train a lot , from the station . 
Curses , to those who are unwell . 
You passed on the infection ! I am NOT enjoying the symptoms , because I cannot sing , I cannot cough without pain throughout my chest , and I will miss out on athletics day because of it . 
DAMMIT I HATE BACTERIA 
o-o -oa-oa ! 
Chest infection . 
Every time I cough , I retch . Isn't life so wonderful ? 
Feels .. Delirious . 
my breath is short 
my throat is like sandpaper 
And the headache in my temples just won't stop . 
Just heard the amazing news . WELL DONE ONSLOW !!! I am very proud of every girl who now has no voice whatsoever from chanting . 
Whoever gave me this cold is not a very nice person . 
Mai nose , it feels like sandpapers . 
Poor Christchurch . It's not going to be nice news once it's all been cleared up . 
I've been watching the news for 3 hours now , the devastation in Christchurch is immense . 
People are being very nonchalant about the earthquake in Christchurch . The last one was bigger but there weren't any casualties . This time , people are dead . 2 buses were crushed by falling buildings , the CBD was heavily damaged , buildings have been razed to the ground . We should still be optimistic about those who may have survived , but right now , it's not something to joke about . 
For the first time in about two years , I got up at 7:30 
Waking the neighbourhood up by singing Florence + The Machine . 
" the STAARS the MOOON they have all been blown out ! " 
I just noticed that I have an extra graphics calculator . wtf . if any of my mates are missing one and shared one with me , tell me . 
Earthquake in house that has almost no solid foundations . 
D: 
I think Wellington might be next for a large earthquake , morbid as it sounds . 
The plates are shifting , and so are we . 
kicking an owl off a football field is lower than low . 
I just saw Mr Spence in town ! XP 
 = I never showed affection to anything but your ego .  = gotta love Parkway Drive . 
Note : do not read ' IT ' by Stephen King before sleeping . 
Peace is but a shadow of death , desperate to forget it's painful past . Though we hope for promising years after shedding a thousand tears , yesterday's sorrow constantly nears . And while the moon still shines blue , by dawn it will turn to scarlet hue . -Kuja , FFIX 
Is walking around the house , dancing to metal . Having a LOT of fun . 
Mum is home ! And she bought me stones ! :D 
Got some new nail polish , guess what colour ! 
~ We'd jump the life to come ~ :D 
You know , eating half of the afghans in the cupboard doesn't get you any favour with your mother , it doesn't get any with an anti-cannibalism society either .

Had the most amazing trumpet , drama and physics lessons . Pas de deux , crazy improvisation exercises and torque make my day UH-MAZING . 
It's been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are ! 
Someday the dream will end <3

I must abscond from this abysmal limpid animation . 
Train , train take us away , take us away , far away . To the future we will go , where it leads , no one knows ! 
Today a guy came up to me and said : " I like your hat " We then conversed and exchanged names and stories about buses , guitars , and numerous other things . It was pretty cool , actually . =) 
I just found a picture of pikachu and heracross and bulbasaur that Eryn drew from when we were small . :3 it is possibly the cutest thing i've ever seen .

Nothing is more depressing than looking at your NCEA results online and realising you really don't have many credits and you've got 25 days left of lessons . 
That Snorlax you just called fat ? Yeah , it's eating rare candies by the DOZEN for you to accept it . That Gastly you just called ugly ? It's been trying to learn a new move to replace Mean Look .

Hair the colour of glowing streetlights-the rain creates a halo . Sit and watch the stars go out as darkness moves closer . In the black we reveal what keeps us whole and unbroken-and turn our souls towards what light remains in our hearts ...

Didn't realise L 490 had creepy war-like chanting at the end of it . Shudder . 
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul , that love never lasts . And we've got to find other ways to make it alone .. But keep a straight face . And i've always lived like this , keeping a comfortable distance . And up until now I had sworn to myself that i'm content with loneliness . Because none of it was ever worth the risk .. 
Cozy Cake Shop chips-the best way to a good afternoon .

After tagging those TagMyBuddy pictures , I have come to realise how well I don't know my friends . It's quite sad to think I do not have enough close friends to be able to tag them perfectly . And I'm slowly drifting from my current group of buddies . I wasn't invited .. and i'm afraid that will keep happening . 
Let's hope tomorrow is better than today . :) 
Research time tomorrow ! It's amazing how I'm not actually procrastinating my science and drama research assignments . I'm even looking up the books I need so I can get them almost straight away . Then I'll be working hard ! XD

I apologise to you , I reacted badly and i won't do it again . So I won't lean towards either infatuation or hate towards Nino , i will only be his friend . It was good while it lasted , but it's over .

Quite a while ago , I was walking to robotics , and saw a dark cloaked figure across the road from jessie maya and i . I looked for about ten seconds , then turned away and asked jessie if she'd seen anything . She said she hadn't , and I dismissed the apparition . About two weeks later , I was walking into the spot where my friends sit , and I feel a cape flowing out behind me .

Making a song list- each song represents one of my friends . If you have any suggestions , for yourself or others , post them here !

" Hold on , i'm trying to think ! " - Mr Stewart 
3 Black Mages albums ... all mine !!! 
I'm feeling nervous , trying to be so perfect .. because I know you're worth it , youre worth it . 
My footsteps echo 
Down the halls 
Their hallowed remains 
Empty as I 

Tears soften the ground 
That falls away into nothing 
I must stay constant 
Like the movement of time 
Or the past will crash 
Into the future 
If I close my eyes 
I can feel eternity 
Caressing my face 
And wiping my eyes 
Endless possibilities 
Flow into my fingertips 
Pull the threads 
And manipulate fate 
OMG . All my contacts have been erased . Message me with your number , people . 
I never thought my mother would be able to carry my grandfather alone . 
Train , train , take us away take us away , far away 
to the future , we will go 
Where it leads , no one knows ! 
Tap exam , wish me LUCK .

Compared to sin , we humans are mere mud puppies . :D i'm a mud puppy !

Pike River mine , the lives of those lost summed up on the evening news . Eerie silence accompanying each of their names as they are read out . The narrator choked when he got to the youngest miner , only 17 years old . 
I hope their souls travel safely to the other side . 
Last day of maths for year eleven . SCORE ! 
Eryn is a LIZARD WOMAN . 
I've been to hollywood , I've been to redwood , I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold . <3 Neil Young 
Just a little poem I wrote about Cantala .. 

We can fly 
Carried on wings of song 
Soaring over land and sea 
Leaving nothing more but awe 
When we fly 
We move with grace 
Enthralling our audience 
And loving nothing more 
We are Cantala 
And we shall arise 
To win our heart's worth 
And we share our magic 
With all denizens of the Earth . 
And there do I see my father . My son . My life . 
And there do I see nature . Pokemon . The world . 
Has new clothes ! :D 
Alone on New Year's Eve .

" Sad is happy for deep people " - Sally Sparrow , Dr Who series 3 . 
I roll down the window 
And then begin to breathe in 
The darkest country road 
And the strong scent of evergreen 
From the passenger seat 
As you are driving me home 
We have to find a better way .
