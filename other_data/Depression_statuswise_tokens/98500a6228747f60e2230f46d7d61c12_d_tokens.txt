Why do most BOYS have to be so selfish , only thinking about themselves , and what THEY want ... 
I am not be the most beautiful , or the 
sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be everyone's 
first choice , but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone 
I'm not , because I'm good at being me . I might not be proud of some 
of the things I've done in the past , but ... I'm 
proud of who I am today . Take me as I am or , watch me as I walk 
away ! Post this to your status if you're proud of being you !

I miss when McDonald's had the different flavored twist cones ! the pink ones and the blue ones were my fav 
Women wonder why men are so fascinated and attracted with the physical attributes with the opposite sex when life is not all about it . This is also the reason why women have a difficult time in trusting and understanding men better . 
Probably going to bed soon . Such a shitty day Sundays suck ass 
I guess I'll go take the bus at 7:30 and go downtown , probably bum around with my friend Kelly , and get something to eat for supper for myself before that 
Going nighty night in a little while , will be thinking of a certain someone :)

Listening to Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime - VERY good album

I am just hoping to find a job , it is really tough and tight at our house , my mom can barely afford anything , and it's just very stressful . 
Just wants to veg out at home , maybe bake some cookies or something . It's too cold out and I just want to stay home , listen to some music , watch some Beavis and Butthead and maybe Simpsons .. 
well besides Danzig and TON I threw in some great ' 80s songs Adam Ant and Duran Duran and all sorts of great stuff IMHO !!!! 
Thank you everyone for the Happy birthday wishes :) 
has to work tonight at 5pm , as well as next Saturday , woo hoo ! 
you know you're broke when you can't afford the dollar menu lol 
I love video games , they are a nice escape from reality sometimes haha 
Watching Roseanne 
is watching Full House 
Wish I felt prettier 
Sick of everyone else getting the fun in life 
head feels like it's going to explode 
gonna relax at home , take a bath , and basically relax , then need to set up a dr. appt tomorrow to find out what's wrong . 
I can't wait til the damn sports crap is off the TV as I cannot hear my music with my Mom's bf's shouting at it !! 
watching Rugrats .. ahh to be a kid again I tell ya 
watching Roseanne yay and it's the older season , if I'm not mistaken , the first season , my favorite one ! :D and I'm putting together a Christmas gift I made for the house , it's a sentimental type of gift 
wants to have some drinks sometime this week 
tired of not having my own phone I have no f###### way to call anyone ever 
Accept me for who I am , don't try to change me to fit something you want . 
is home after a long day , now just relaxing 
wish I had a laptop , would be so much easier being able to lay down on my bed and still be on the computer 
probably going to the mall later or something after 5 
decided to stay up late and go through my jewelry 
I have the worst migraine , I don't know why nothing is helping it 
has a very bad migraine again .. :[ 
has a bad migraine again 
" When I'm down and blue , rather be me than you " -- yes it's a song 
playing Super Mario All Stars on SNES . Wish I could figure out how to get the sound to come through my stereo though 
I am so worried about one of our cats , Simba , he has not been eating too much lately :( - he is over 10 yrs old 
is beat , was so busy at Homefront , and what kinda nut calls the cops cuz someone wouldn't answer their phone ? a drunken sot LOL 
realizes how much happier I am without that anchor in my life , he was just a user anyway 
Compromise has always been my strong point , I make it a point to be fair ! =) 
is beat from working , now relaxing , eating and watching youtube 
" I was busy " gets so annoying to hear arrghh lol 
:( 
might go to Pick N Save though , I feel more comfortable with places that have self checkouts then people aren't eyeing you or looking down on you cuz you have to use a food card - I'm of the ones who don't take advantage , and who really needs it , it really helps my Mom out as she is barely left with much money , and for me jobs are scarce 
Oh how I love these daily headaches and migraines , how they never end .. =( 
wish I could at least win ONE of the Monopoly prizes ... 
Went to K-Mart with my Mom a little while ago , and the Valentine's Day crap is out , ughh , the only good things about it , is the candy , and the fact it only lasts one day 
I still and always will hate Sundays , feels like a day of DEATH !!! 
annoyed at Derek posting stupid crap on my status 
just sitting at the computer with Cleo on my lap , with her paw stretched out 
Had a delicious dinner at Adam's , he is definitely good at what he does :) 
Damn it is freezing cold ! brrrrrrrrrrrrr ... :( 
BENNIE , BENNIE , BENNIE , BENNIE , BENNIE BENNIE AND THE JETS- GOD I LOVE THAT SONG !!!!!!! - always have honestly - he may be you know , but he seriously kicks ass in my honest opinion , I don't care what you think !! 
has a migraine and is extremely hungry but there is absolutely nothing to eat and I don't have much for money either 
I HATE MY CUZIN 
I seriously need more energy , I never feel like doing anything 
I hate it when he gets that way to my Mom 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! 
can't sleep ... 
I'm sorry if my form of joking isn't raunchy and filthy/sexual . I can't help that I am uncomfortable with that , that is me . My form of joking is tamer , yet sometimes a bit morbid . I can't help what makes me upset , I am a sensitive person . 
lmao " all I wanted was her GD wallet , and the bitch gave me a hard time " 
I am SO beat from work I could collapse 
has a major migraine but gonna go to bed eventually 
can't wait to get my N64 memory card in the mail so I can finally save Mystical Ninja instead of getting far and having to shut it off and lose it all 
my cousin is awesome =) 
Post this as your status and see what people love 
about you . I love your _____ . 
I am just me , and that's enough for me , Who cares if I'm no supermodel or social butterfly . I will NEVER change for ANYONE ! :D 
Why do most men have to be so selfish , only thinking about themselves , and what THEY want ... 
has an interview at the Sheboygan Humane Society today at 2:00 for cat caregiver :) 
It was such a workout giving little Sophia a bath haha :D 
might take a bath/shower then a little nap 
it's just too damn cold outside , I need to get a winter jacket ... from Goodwill , don't have the $ to buy a new one 
eating a snack I made and watching Beavis and Butthead episodes on Youtube . Always loved them , grew up watching em haha 
MTV should just change their name , Music Television my ass . All they have on there are a bunch of teens being pregnant , dozens of reality shows . Of course if they did have music shows/videos they would have crap on there anyway , from what I've seen , not even Headbanger's Ball is that impressive anymore . 
argh I can't stand Nickleback's music !! lol 
I miss the shows I grew up with , like Clarissa Explains It All , Hey Arnold , Are You Afraid Of the Dark , All That , Kenan and Kel , Salute Your Shorts , I could go on .. 
they are so hard to find , and if they are put up on Youtube or something , they get taken down , so I have nowhere to watch them unless they put them on DVD :( 
Stupid computer was acting stupid for the last hour + couldn't get on internet ugh I hate that . 
I wish I could go back in time and be a kid again if only for a day , I miss those times so much these days 
pie is in the oven , now gonna watch Plains , 
Trains , and Automobiles , even if it is on TV , I'd rather watch my DVD 
cuz it's uncut haha . 
is wishing I could find a job , it really is very depressing and I don't know what else to do 
is extremely frustrated . 
going to play some more Bully for a little while , then going to bed 
Took EVERYTHING off of my Zune just to get ONE picture off of it , what a pain in the ass , this is going to take awhile now lol oh well at least I can sorta start off fresh 
Goodnight 
is watching the original Night Of the Living Dead on youtube . It's still pretty good , but I still prefer the 1990 remake 
I am LOVING that song Goody Two Shoes I am serious it is in my head honestly it kicks ass !!!! 
probably gonna be going to bed soon , have my jacket on the bed yet , as well as 3 cats sleeping on there , but waiting for me to move my rear to the bed under the covers :D 
Black black black black number one 
Darn it I thought my Mom meant we were dying my hair today , not til my b-day lol Holy s *** it is too frickin cold out !!! 
Spending new years eve at home with my Mom and her bf Kenny

taking the 6:30 bus , making sure I am bundled up enough , and then going to the mall for a little while , see if my friend Kelly is down there before I go . Gonna get something to eat too 
had a really great time last night ! would definitely do that again , just gotta make sure I drink a glass of water between drinks at least lol 
Step away from the jukebox , Mr. " Renholec " :D 
It's too *&^%$#@ cold out !!!!!!!!! 
for some reason , this year , I feel more bah humbug about Christmas . I can't stand most of the music , it's so repetitive , in every store I swear I hear like 500 different versions of one song . Then I wanted to go to Piggly Wiggly the other day , well I get driven out of there cuz of some horrendous accordion player standing next to the bell ringer . 
was thinking of making stuff for at my grandparents , but realized that we don't have anything to make with , and can't make a punch with only ginger ale and vodka yuck , not to mention nothing is open to buy some stuff and besides that lol not much money 
is in dire need of money/a GD job , this is getting ridiculous , and also pissing me off when it's suspected that money was taken from MY room 
feeling much better today thank goodness :) 
is watching part of " Monster " on Youtube before Raw comes on - God men can be such f ****** PIGS !! 
been having an upset stomach today , not sure why . Gonna stop at the mall cuz I have to use this card thing before it won't be valid 
going to play Bully for awhile ( a PS2 game ) 
I amuse myself in my very own private hell 
now playing Super Mario World 
not feeling so great today , violent tummy and head what in the hell is wrong with me lately egads ! :/ 
yum candy hearts , I have a passion for the pink ones lol my Mom likes the Brach's ones , they sure are good and addicting lol and I got some of the " Sweethearts candies " kind ( like thick necco wafers ) and they're good also . yep I could fall into a pool of them , just not the green apple ones lol 
at home relaxing now . Love the gifts that I got . We all also did White Elephant gifting with the family this year lol 
After the holidays I am definitely gonna start walking more , I feel like such a pig lol 
had a wonderful time with an amazing man :) 
Merry Christmas everyone ! 
I hope I don't have another nightmare like last night :( 
Just watched ' Frozen ' - Not a bad movie , although I kinda wished they would've showed the aftermath at the end , still good though- watching deleted scenes and behind the filming . There's no gimmicks in this movie at all , they are really there , no CGI and stuff like that , they were really pretty much going through what they did in the movie in a way , pretty cool . 
again my Mom is STILL sleeping yet !!!!! 
is playing Bully again haha - have to work on Friday at Homefront @ 5 yay :D 
Now I went to Elton John , great singer right there !!!! GREAT music !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
ugh stupid computer decided to be a piece of crap when making a burned cd for a part of a gift , couldn't copy half the CD , now it will not come out of the drive 
SERIOUSLY gets sick of having to deal with my Mom's bf's mutterings ughhh A-hole 
is going to bed 
just watching some more Roseanne and going to get ready for bed , at least maybe ... possibly ..... try to get to bed earlier hahah 
needs to find a punch recipe and maybe some snack recipe for my grandparents tonight 
has a headache and kinda just wants to go to bed 
needs her tummy to feel better , not even the Pepto worked - wtf :/ usually it does lol 
Damn cat just takes a crap in the litterbox in here and leaves the room , thanks alot it smells nasty , damn cat ..... 
feels like the biggest jerk ever today , I didn't mean to forget like I did :( 
thinking I'm gonna be turning in early these waves of nausea are killing me 
Mom is finally taking down the tree and putting all the other Christmas stuff away 
is going to bed , soooooooo tired 
is playing Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island :) 
Well SOMEONE has framed me or something about ordering pizzas to their Dad's house , an officer came to my house to see if I was the one that ordered them . I would REALLY like to know what the hell this is all about cuz I would never do something like that . I am sure you can take a wild guess at who I am talking about hmm ?? ha I would never do something so dumb 
it is so fricken cold outside too damn cold for me I can't stand it lol ! 
watching an episode or two of ... you guessed it .. Roseanne haha ... then going to bed , gonna get up in the morning early enough that I can make a special thing for breakfast besides the bacon they're making- saw it in a " Twinkie cookbook " french twinkies , sounds good and worth a try , just like french toast but with Twinkies lol 
watching Faces Of Death , never seen it before . Realized recently that most of it is only acted out and not real , only some scenes are real , like that one politician shooting himself , that kinda stuff . It is very interesting though either , way , guess I just have always had a morbid curiousity muahaha 
is now playing Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon for Nintendo 64 . got my memory card for it in the mail today so now I can save it , then I'm going to sleep 
Made a good supper ; oven BBQ ribs ( with bones ) with a sauce I came up with , some instant " Loaded " mashed potatoes , and a salad to start with that had some fresh parsley and a couple other fixings , was too full to eat dessert ! :D 
Excedrin Menstrual is a miracle for the nasty pain , works fast , thank god ! 
going downtown for awhile for a walk since I didn't last night lol 
Can't wait til the temperature starts getting a little more tolerable ( at least 35deg+) then I can go for my long walks again like when I used to walk to South Pier 
home and beat , but is worth it . Going to the mall tomorrow to take advantage of a little deal they have . 
" OMG it's decaf ! who let that into the house ?! " 
all of a sudden I feel sluggish , like a zombie 
Yay I got my new Safelink phone now since asshole pulled the plug on the other one 
another headache grrrr , and had an irritating angering dream which probably didn't help :/ what is with the dreams I have sheesh 
Hmm found something called Traces Of Death , too bad there are no videos of it
