See that I'm never late for anything these days ? I set all my clocks to different times ahead . I don't know which one has the correct time ( most probably none ) but they always make me earlier than everyone else , or just in time . I can't seem to see the downside of this ( except that my time is always incorrect of course ) , and that this is the longest status update I have ever had .

If only there was not only a dislike button on facebook , but an algorithm set up that has an averaging component to it as well : 3 dislike , 2 likes = +1 dislike . Wouldn't that be just purrfect . 
Ever wondered why you rarely hear of independent men but more of independent women ? Almost as if it's a given that if you are a man you are definitely independent , or rather , the default of a woman is to be dependent . Hmm .

Things you most probably shouldn't be doing when you are drunk : 1 ) . Tell people how awesome they are . " You're my best mate , you are " . 2 ) . Ask for extra-hot chilli sauce on your food . You don't get superpowers just because you are drunk . 3 ) Hold any kind of philosophical discussion .

Why do I still watch LOST ? I know how it's going to end . I think the plot is getting more ridiculous with each episode . Perhaps it's just that Desmond is so hooooot . Yeah , brother .

Shared the metro today with a middle-aged guy who accidentally ( presumably ) soiled his pants ( a lot ! ) . At least he had the decency to move away from the seat when he felt the floodgates opening . I thought of prof . Ohring during the whole ordeal !

" I've suffered through dates that were very extreme

And eventually even their manners did erode 
With scores for politeness nowhere near the mode 
So I apologize for being so informal 
But I'm so glad I finally found someone normal "

for your fear of being locked in the world's limitations . 
for your fear of the absurdity of existence .

Watched a doc . yesterday on propaganda . First quarter was ok : the media has an agenda bla bla bla . Then suddenly , lo and behold the whole focus shifted to some conspiratorial hogwash I cannot even believe that some people would believe : apparently there is an elite society that includes the NYT , & other media giants who are pro-communist and want to take over the whole world . 
I like it on the kitchen floor , almost always .

Thank you ALL for the lovely messages . Spent the day ( well almost all the day ) watching the rain . wooohooo !!!! rain rain rain uuuhuuuhuuu ( tried to say the last part with the tune of 2 and a half man .. ) 
Pretended to sleep on the tram to avoid a too-much-for-my-comfort-zone-chattering-from-a-stranger small talk . Pretend- slept past my tram stop by accident . 
CW : What sort of a Dictator is Qadafi anyway ? He's only a Colonel . We cannot have a decent war against someone who is just a Colonel . Idi Amin was a Field Marshall . Fidel is El Jefe . Gushungo , like the Queen , is Commander in Chief of all the Armed Forces . Muammar you are taking a piss . I think NATO should bomb you very heavily until you stop playing around and promote yourself to General , at least . 
Done and done for today . Now , where is that wonderful sunshine !? 
A real woman always keeps her house clean & organized , the laundry basket is always empty . She's always well dressed , hair done . She never swears , behaves gracefully in all situations & all circumstances . She has more than enough patience to take care of her family , always has a smile on her lips & a kind word for every1 . Post this as your status if you , too , suspect that you might be a man ! 
Hey guys , is the uni open tomorrow since Labour's Day fell on a Sunday ? 
When it comes to Osama's death , I think I'm going to join the birthers conspiracy nutjobs and say : Pics or it didn't happen ! 
is absolutely thrilled that not only does Osama sleep with the fishes after being gunned down in terms of international law like the mad dog he was , but this was done in a way which will make a really good movie . Cast : Denzel Washington as Obama , Michael Douglas as Biden , Scarlett Johanssen as Hilary Clinton ( hehehe ) , Hugh Grant as Cameron , Colin Firth as Nick Clegg and Nick Clegg as Osama . 
It's weird when news sites , in suggesting links , say things like " You might also like ... ' 6 killed in Baghdad bomb attacks '" 
Pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space , 
' Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth . 
Hegel is arguing that the reality is merely an a priori adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics , Kant via the categorical imperative is holding that ontologically it exists only in the imagination , and Marx is claiming it was offside . 
This is not a good year for Psychology . First the controversial Bem article published by the JSP ( parapsychology revisited ) , and now Psychology today ( strictly speaking it's safe to say that it's not really peer reviewed ) published an article by the evolutionary psycho-logist Kanazawa claiming that Black women are * OBJECTIVELY * the least attractive people in the world . 
If anyone asks , tomorrow I'm going to spend a sizeable amount of my time doing ' field research ' aka watching Jersey Shore . #Team Snookie ;)

How come no one told me the world is ending tomorrow !! OMG oO !!!! 
Science is like sex : sometimes something useful comes out of it , but that is not why we are doing it . 
Wise words from my supervisor : There are 2 kinds of data : those that are in line with your hypothesis AND interesting data . Mine are very interesting . Ah well , off to the lab once more . 
PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by pandas . Pandas are nearly unstoppable , and when hungry , also breathe fire . 71% of people won't copy this into their status because they have already been eaten by pandas , 28% are hiding in their showers with fire extinguishers awaiting the coming pandocalypse , and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post . 
OMG you guys !!!!, I just noticed that my graduation hat has numerous messages written all over it !! Was I that drunk on the graduation day that I didn't realise it ? Thank you all for the lovely messages one year later :) 
Good luck New York . Fingers crossed for you ! 
Redundant but I will still say it : I strongly dislike condescending benevolent people ! 
Help me choose a coat colour , I want to repaint my apartment . 
No , I don't have a favourite colour , and my furniture is predominantly white . 
I hate you All . 
Had dinner with the Mayor of Stockholm in Stockholm City Hall . * How cool is that ! 
* Well , me and 1200 other people ... but still . 
Listen carefully , for I will speak in metaphors . 
Beware my loved one ( she would often say ) beware of the insipid vanities and idle dissipations of the metropolis ; beware of the unmeaning luxuries of the City and of the stinking fish of the surroundings . 
Alas ( exclaimed I ) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never be exposed to ? 
Baaaaa I can't handle vodka anymore . 
WARNING , PLEASE READ - I don't usually re-post these but ... If someone comes to your front door and asks you to remove your clothes and dance in your front door with your arms in the air .. DO NOT do this ! it is a scam !! They just want to see you naked . Please copy and post this to your status -- I wish I had received this yesterday . I feel so stupid now .. 
I am still waiting for NATO to demand that the British government step down and start arming the rebels in the street ! 
" When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land . They said " Let us pray . " We closed our eyes . When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land . " Desmond Tutu 
The more I read on African history the more I think our history classes at school were crap ! This week I covered Somalia and Ethiopia , I will start on Southern Africa soon . Sidenote : I totally want to visit Ethiopia !!! 
' From research on counterfactual thinking we know that thinking about negative past events can elicit negative affect ( Roese , 1997 ) , and , in particular , this negative affect is characterised by sadness ( Mandel , 2003 ) . ' Oh Psychology :) 
Congrats Sonia Nyathi . I knew anyhow that you'd make it ;)

Bad idea to work from home today ! Construction workers just outside my window : drilling , laughing , smoking & probably staring at me ( that part probably not true but still weird feeling persists ) . All in all , just doing their job . Just wish they would do it somewhere else !
