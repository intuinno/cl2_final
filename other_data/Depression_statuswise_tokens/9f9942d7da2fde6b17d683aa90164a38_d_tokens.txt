What in the world matters if the world you live in might crumble down into pieces ? 
What if the change has changed too much ? 
What if the life I had now was not the best it could be ? 
What will happen to my idealisms of life ? 
Would they change or not ? 
Would they shatter away like my heart ? 
What would happen ? 
What can I do ? 
Who will be glad or sad ? 
Whom will misery bless ? 
Why am I starting every sentence with ' w' ?

That is why I was a loner then I started to trust people now and suddenly something caused me to fall back to where I was .... just because someone betrayed my trust again . Should I go back to being a loner ? 
Hey guys lets try this out ! 
Time for some truth telling ! 
Someone say something about me 
someone else say something about the person that said something about me 
and etc etc etc 
But the format has to be this : 
" ________ is ________ but he/she is ____________ " 
It doesnt mean you cant post again if you posted already ! 
Just you cant post after your own ! 
Sick and tired of mournings 
This guy was talking to this lady fortune teller . The fortune teller said : " On this day , in this hour ... 5 years from now you are going to die " the guy stands up and says

He dies . 
If I write something smart I people will like the status but it hurts my brain just to think of one - Damn my brain hurts 
All the pain from my 2-8th grade just flashed before me ... I was bullied and picked on I hated the world I didnt trust anyone .... I got people who I trust did I change ? or am I just little depressed ? 
Did anyone noticed that you get more likes if you mess up on a status rather than if you manage to get the status right ?

If I was more better and much more kind 
Would I have been more happier ? 
Damn it , Emo moments ..... Damn middle school memories 
School is the corner around ......

Forensics is science of Human imperfection . I am now very disappointed . 
Every one of the cases solved were cases with flaws . 
Perfect crimes became cold cases . 
Even with case being solved majority of them were let free on no charge basis . 
I am starting to distrust the legal system now . 
Science of Human Imperfection HA ! I been studying that since I was 8 !
