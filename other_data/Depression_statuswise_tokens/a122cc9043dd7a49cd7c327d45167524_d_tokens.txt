Thank you to all who have switched here from my old account . I truly appreciate it . :) 
Now , please , don't forget to unfriend the old one . 
FB is being ridiculous . It has blocked my ability to reply to all of your lovely messages . I thank you all for the support . It it much appreciated . <3 :) 
Please remember to remove my Juliet Weston account from your friends lists , if you haven't already . I've done all I can to block her from this account and to hide what won't be suspicious on the other account , but it seems it would be safer to simply remove all possibilities of an accidental post to the wrong account . 

Thank you . :) 
Copy this and put it in your status if you know someone or have heard of someone who knows someone . If you don't know anyone or even if you've just heard of someone who doesn't know anyone then do still copy this . It's important to spread the message ... Oh , and the hearts ! ?????? For goodness sake , don't forget the hearts ! ?????? 
Everyone ! I have a new email address : oncebitten@post.com . Please update your address books . :) 
FB is still being stupid . They still won't let me send messages ! URGH ! * stabbity * 
I need help building my coffee machine . Please send parts ! 
Thank you ! :)
