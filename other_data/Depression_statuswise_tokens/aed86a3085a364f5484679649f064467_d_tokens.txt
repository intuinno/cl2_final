Even Newt Gingrich is on his 3rd marriage . Britney Spears was married exactly 55 hours on a whim . Yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? REALLY ?! Feel free to copy and paste if you agree

Just one word of encouragement can make the difference between giving up & going on . There is power in what you say ; speak carefully . 
WOW its funny how people ask for favors when things are " supposedly " going bad but dont have a word to say when things are good ... It's funny that you chose to do the things that led up to you leaving but you wanna blame everyone else .. You should search thru that brain of yours and sort thru all the LIES and all the TRUTHS ...

I just love all these people who blame Obama for everything wrong with this country .... I really wonder how anyone could forget the idiot who spent 8 yrs in office and left a big mess for the next man to clean up ... everyone always b*tching about healthcare .... 30 million Americans will now have the chance to see a doctor regularly and get medicines they desperately need

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile ..

Ladies .... when a man shows you his true self please take it for what it is ... his actions speak WAY louder than words .... once his actions show you whats up never take what comes out of his mouth as the truth ... Character lies in a persons actions !!!

Having technical difficulties today :/ 
Even though I'm not a big fan of dishes and housework at night it is lovely to wake up to a nice clean home . 
Well .... consider my mind blown 
When you die it will not matter how much money you had , the size of your house or your car nor how many friends you had . The only thing that will matter is how much of an effect that you had in the life of a child . 
Time to go hook these hooligans up with some good eats . 
ugh why must I keep waking up at 5 am ?!?! 
How much of your personality is how you really are and how much of it just playing the role you think you're supposed to ? 
So , let me get this straight ... Charlie Sheen can make a " porn family , " Kelsey Grammer can end a 15-year marriage over the phone , Larry King can be on divorce #9 , Britney Spears had a 55-hour marriage , Jesse James and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE . Yet , the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you are proud to support equal rights . 
Hooking it up for my honey's bday today ... baby back ribs , cajun potato salad , baked beans , candied yams and chocolate cake ... can't wait til he gets home ! 
Happy Valentines to all you lovers out there :)

The first woman was created from the rib of a man . She was not made from his head to top him , nor from his feet to be trampled on by him , but out of his side to be equal to him , under the arm to be protected & next to the heart to be loved

2 billion people tuned in to watch two human beings get married . Two people who are no better or worse than anyone else . Status is an illusion that we buy into . Imagine if 2 billion of us let go of status/class segregation , saw one another as equals and put effort into shifting ourselves and others to make the world a more peaceful place . 
As soon as it gets warm and humid like this I'm ready to chop off the little bit of hair that I let grow back . 
Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it , and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's Depression Awareness Week and 1 in 5 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support . We copied and pasted , will you ? 
I am laughing my a$$ off at all these people who are saying things about Bin Laden like they are white house correspondents or something .... we will only ever know what they tell us ... you can theorize and speculate all you want , I find it doubtful that the WHOLE truth will ever come to light though . 
Funny how people's insecurities and jealousy spews out into everything they say ... instead of cutting people down try a little bit of support and encouragement ! 
I hate all these tagged photos of shoes but damn , some of them are hott ! 
Why are my children fighting their sleep tonight ?? Jerks .... mom is sleepyyyy 
Dear EVERYONE , you won't find out who has looked at your profile . 
You won't know what you look like in the future . 
You won't know what that man saw when he walked in on his daughter . 
And you can't see the leaked video of Osama's killing . 
So use your brain , stop clicking on spam links !!!!!! 
If you agree , post this on your wall . 
In honor of Mother's Day we are going to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother and keep it there till May 9 . I did and so have several others . If you will and like this idea , please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many beautiful mothers we can get on FB . 
I have " liked " a bunch of recipe pages here on fb and all of them have been posting hispanic dishes for Cinco De Mayo .... I keep looking at the chicken I took out like WTF ... I don't want you !

Wow ... does not seem like 9 years ago I was laid up in a hospital bed all big and sweaty giving birth to one of the greatest miracles of my life ... Happy Birthday to my babygirl ... I love you . 
Happy Mother's Day to all the ladies holding it down day in and out ! One day of appreciation is not enough !
