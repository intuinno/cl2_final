me : did you see that ? he was grilling me so much just now , meliss . Melissa Stein : it`s because he`s hungry , he`s gonna eat you . : X -- roflmao . i love us (:< 3 
love this weather x100000 , it should stay this way forever . <3 
words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks your heart . 
so i`ve been sitting at my computer for two hours and i only have a page and a half done of my ap essay . lovely . 
can`t sleeeeeep . : / 
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open that i won't be making a mistake . ; night nighttt . <3 
you take the breath right out of me . 
Please 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish 
for 2010/2011 is that people will understand that being gay is not a 
disease , nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure 
but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ! 93% won't copy and paste this ? 
does someone from my section wanna give me the stuff that the clarinets have to be tested on in band ? (: 
got soaked walking not even a block to my house , i'm loving this rain rofl . 
karma`s gonna come back and punch you in the face so hard , i swear . 
why does it have to be so cold outside ... ? 
i just died a little inside . ; ; 
must be exhausting to lose your own game . 
so apparently i have to edit an ap paper , read for ap , do social issues journal and economics homework for tomorrow . rofl guess who`s not going to sleep tonight . 
failing this english test tomorrow , hands down . 
so someone's sitting outside in their car right now , blasting justin bieber songs . seriously . rofl . 
definitely did horrible on the sat subject test . whatever . i don't care . 
those who hate so strongly must have once loved deeply ; they must have once embraced what they now set on fire . 
can`t sleep , so typical : / 
half hour of sleep last night :/ screw school , i'm going back to bed . 
finally gonna take the nap that i was thinking about all day <3 
how can you possibly cry about losing something you never had to begin with ? 
it`s gorgeous out , but i`m stuck doing this stupid ass ap paper . life is screwed . : / 
never forget those who died nine years ago today ; both the people who died as the buildings fell and those who gave up their lives trying to save them . god bless america and all our people <3 
" i can count the number of girls vergil has been with on one hand . you know why ? there are none . that's why . " 
do we seriously have school tomorrow ? i feel like my weekend just started :/ 
i really want some thai food right now :/ 
i forgot how bad it felt when you remember it`s sunday afternoon and you have homework . : / 
all and all i learned a lesson from it though ; you never see it coming , you just get to see it go . 
head hurts stomach hurts and i still have a poster to do for social issues . : / 
so nervous about this subject test tomorrow . :/ 
you can't spell ' believe ' without ' lie ' . 
assassin`s creed brotherhood tomorrow <3 
living in the past is not the way to live ; i wish you could hear me say that i miss you . 
multiplayer in ac : brotherhood is way too addicting :/ 
buying orange ribbons and stuff for spirit week ; if you want let me know . (: 
band was great , good job guys ! <3 
at home now , soo tired ; head hurts so bad :/ 
cannot wait to graduate , i'm done with all the bullshit . really . 
if the end is so much better , why don`t we just live forever ? 
so i'm sitting thinking about what i should be thankful for and the first thing that i can think of is my friends ; there are too many fake people & i'm glad i found you guys , who stuck with me through all the bullshit . so screw everyone else , i got you guys & that's all i need , you know who you are , ilysfm <3 
don't do anything for anyone else ; don't think about no ones best interest but your own . being nice gets you nothing but being someone elses doormat . 
ap english classwork ? has to be done for tomorrow ? almost twenty questions ? you're funny . night . 
whatever . i'm done . 
all i know is these last four days of school better go by quickly . :/ 
writing these personal essays for colleges is a pain . : / 
someone needs to do my economics project for me so i can play assassin`s creed brotherhood , thanks . (: 
thanks to Mindy Tam , i will be dreaming of vergil on sushi platters tonight . so . when i wake up disturbed tomorrow morning , i`m texting you an angry text . even though most of this was my fault but you went along with it , so . oh and let's not forget the whipped cream . god what's wrong with us . <3 ;; 
i really really want to be in italy right about now :'( 
but why am i still up . :/ 
when you hit rock bottom , you`ve got no way to go but up . 
i must have been the only idiot walking home in the rain without an umbrella or a hood .. - ____ - ;; 
" don't play games , it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over ; cause if i get burnt , i'ma show you what it's like to hurt . " - ilovee him <3 
misery loves it`s company . 
IF 
YOU have a cartoon picture as your profile picture , REMOVE IT . A group 
of pedophiles made it up . They're doing it because kids will accept 
their friend requests faster if they see a cartoon picture . It has 
nothing to do with supporting child violence . It was on the TV show 
that warns you about internet frauds , plus tonight's news . SET THIS AS 
YOUR STATUS TO WARN OTHERS ! 
jensen ackles . <3
