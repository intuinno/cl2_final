So a guy walks into a bar ..... that's it ...... well if you wanna know so badly you ask him what happened next !!! 
Life is actually nothing like a box of chocolates . It's more like playing ' Frogger ' . 
Seeing the future seems like it would clear up a lot of stress & uncertainty ... but on the other hand ... if you knew everything was gonna happen before it happened you'd eventually get bored . 
I Really HATE early rehearsals ! 
Sometimes ....... I just don't want to ...... 
Can't have your cake and eat it too ? If I have or own a cake you can be damn sure I'm eating it ...... provided that I'm in the mood for cake .
