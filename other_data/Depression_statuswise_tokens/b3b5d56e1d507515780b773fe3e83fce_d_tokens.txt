Ya know listening to love songs sometimes relaxes me other time I get depressed . Mostly cause it makes me think of the 3 guys I was ever interested in , ( not that I would ever tell who they were ) , one of which broke my heart .

My oldest son is gay ... he even looks like a girl sometimes . I'm always looking for him but he hides with his sisters and I tend to over look him ... still at least he doesn't have long hair . XDDDDDD

Watching ' Anger Management ' . XD 
TODAY IS INTERNATIONAL CAPS LOCK DAY !!!

Well its been a little more than a week since Ruki joined our family . He's grown some although I haven't really noticed too much cause he's with me all the time . 
Mama is scared of automatic car washes ! XDDDD 
Naruto shippu 175 was touching , I almost cried twice . 
You know since I've been out of high school I've done a lot of thinking ... there are things I regret not doing during that time . I wish I hadn't been so oblivious and naive about some people . Sometimes I say to myself ' if only I had been smarter or less oblivious ' I wouldn't have all this anger and regret ... but it couldn't have been helped at that time . 
Ruki is so cute when he sleeps ... especially when he runs and barks . Weird , but cute . Assuming you've had a pet in the past , did she/he ever do anything that made you laugh or go awww ? My dork will run into walls . * stare * ..... * laughs hard * 
Asking for help or advice is always hard for me ... my face got so hot today ... DX
