i have one more thing to check when i get on the computer now . email , and facebook . yay ! ( not ) . who said that ?? *looks areound nervously * who's there ? *sneak attack from erin and sabrina * AAAAHHHH !!! hello !! 
i'm exhausted and i didn't do anything . bleh . i feel so bad and sleepy .... good night . 
listening to music and talking to friends .. doing nothing i should be doing but knowing it'll be done soon .. and ...? i don't know what else . XD i feel lost right now . how random . 
i am so glad i took health over the summer . there's no way i could handle 30 weeks of health . 4 is bad enough ... 
i just took my permit test and got 100% !!! i am psyched !!! 
i is watching twilight right now !!! sam's idea , before you ask ( and i know someone will ) . pretty funny though . 
the dance was pretty cool . now i get to go to coalinga . i wanna sleep more !!!!!! T_T 
al right . doc says i have a small concussion . and before you ask ( because someone will ) i hit my head on a shelf . and when i was 4 i hit my head on a shelf . only then , i got stiches instead of a concussion . 
you know what ? i finally realized ... i just don't give a shit right now . take THAT . 
Aries is second only to Aquarius in independence , but the world will know most of his or her innermost secrets due to the unique Aries trait of opening the mouth and inserting the foot . now who here is an aries ? 
read through my home page . 30 posts wereabout applications . 10 were either pictures or somebody actually talking . imagine , people talking on facebook . such a weird concept ... and i just spent like a half hour with my flair board . it's the only app i love going on . have a nice weekend everyone !! 
big puddles and a car .... oh the fun i can have ...!!!! 
alright . i have been told to inform people that genna is resting semi-comfortably at the hospital at the moment . 
i just looked down my home page , and i saw only about 3 or 4 actual posts that had what somebody actually said . almost everything is off of an app or something else like that . 
JV soccer won , 2-0 . Varsity tied 0-0 and the ref called game before they could finish attacking the goal . it was probably illegal , wrong , and still quite funny . 
in a perfect world this could never happen in a p[erfect world you'd still be here and it makes no sense i could just pick up the pieces but to you this means nothing nothing at all . perfect world-simple plan . if you want an idea of how i feel , check my flair board . it's pretty damn accurate .

my hair turned really weird after the game today . but it was a really good game . 
i don't want to go to bed , that would be admitting that today is over , and that yesterday can't be reclaimed . i liked yesterday , te performance , the friends , the fun , the random looks on faces through closing elevator doors . i'm gonna miss a lot of people . good night . 
good morning people of the world . it is nearly the crack of noon and time to get on with our lives !

if you're not the one then why does my sould feel glad today ? if you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way ? if you are not mine then why does your heart return my call ? if you are not mine would i have the strength to stand at all ?

i hope this makes you smile . 
i love scaring people . not to friends : i just might scare some people tomorrow . BEWARE !!! 
i am magic . 
okay , to anyone who knows * PHYSICS * : we know that F = ma which is force equaling mass times acceleration . but for F = Gm1*m2/r^2 , does F still equal force/net force or does it equal gravitational force ?

second thought , i'm getting off . too much pain . i'll see you guys at the concert . 7 o clock . see you there . 
well , i just got a giant shock . i made regional honor choir . i was sick at the audition , and still can't sing fully . this is surreal ...

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . A woman has read this entire post . A man is still looking at his thumb . Re-post if this made you smile ? 
Maybe you've heard of that mythical place called the Court of Miracles hello you're there Where the lame can walk and the blind can see But the dead don't talk so you won't be around to reveal what you've found We have a method for spies and intruders rather like hornets protecting their hive here in the Court of Miracles where it's a miracle if you get out alive 
can someone give me the link to the choir site so i can download the songs for my iPod ?
