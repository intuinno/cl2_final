south park KINDA cool , not very laugh-out-loud funny , but better than i expected . def not M-rated material . 
ok ... no longer emo ... no longer depressed ... but im losing it ... i cant live like this ... he's gotten control of me and no matter how hard i or any of my friends try , i cant get my heart back from him ... 
so bored and should be doing school stuff ... things i've done since coming home ( not that anyone cares , but yeah , that's boredom for you ): 1 ) finishing iced mocha from mcdonalds 2 ) get into pjs 3 ) watch 2 eps of ouran 4 ) look at pics of tamaki on deviantart ( and was quite disappointed in lack of good ones ) yeah , im really productive

Seriously , anyone out there who knew me at MHOC knows how miserable I was there . Didn't think it was possible , but I'm a billion times more miserable now . 
anyone out there who will battle me wen we go back to school ? ( my team ranges from level 27-34 , but will probably go WAY up by the time we go back )

doesn't know if this is for real , but is now going back to Pokemon : 
ATTENTION : the group asking everyone to change their profile picture to a cartoon character is actually a group of pedophiles . There doing it because kids will accept their friend request faster if they see a cartoon picture . It has nothing to do with any Child charities . IT'S ON TONIGHTS NEWS , Copy&paste this on your status . Let everyone know .

OMG I'm gonna DIE of hypothermia at this point !!! ( Okay , obviously an exaggeration , but still !!! ) XP 
YES !!! Gonna get to go to Megacon the day after a college visit !!! :D 
There are those who don't know ... they'd truly be shocked if they only knew . And to those who do know ... well , only a very few of them truly comprehend the severity of it all and how horrible it all is . However , no a soul is aware at all ... about how far it has come to ...
