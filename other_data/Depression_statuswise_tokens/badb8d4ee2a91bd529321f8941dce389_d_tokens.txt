Is it just me , or did this week start out horribly ? 
School . It's always there . Me ... I was there , then I wasn't .... No seriously . I was . " Was . " 
Time to chill ? I think so ... 
" And know that if I , Knew all the answers I would Not hold them from you'd Know all of the things that I know . We told eachother , there is no other way . " 
Hiding from the enemy is hard . Hiding in plain sight is easy . Becoming invisible however , only belongs to those who hold Secrecy . 
I think I'm allowed to wish everyone an official Merry Christmas now !

No ! I watch you and you don't watch me ! 
Just want to wish everyone a happy holiday ! ~ 
" It's okay . We will be there . Besides , there's not only negative feelings inside people . Courage ... Everyone has the courage ... here . " 
" Where does this go ? " 
As of today ... There shall be no more love for anyone . 
I'm never going to get work done after this all starts .... 
" So if I ever see you on the street / Ill pretend that I didnt see / And turn my face / No use in small talk anyways " 
Why am I up ? Why else ? It's story time . Just ... Not for you people . 
I believe the obsession has finally hit ... Thank you for a totally free weekend . 
Meh ... Fun but it could have been better ... 
Huh . Look at that . 2:30 am exactly . 
For those who felt it , 5.7 in SoCal . South of Palm Springs . 
Summer school ... Oh the joy ... 
Complete virus take over of my laptop ! 
What ? 
Muse is a good way to end the week . Mhmm .
