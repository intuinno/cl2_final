People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious .

All of us have thousands of wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour .

Mom has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed , seen me fall , cheered me on , kept me going strong , and DROVE ME CRAZY at times ... Moms are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever ! Put this on your status if you love your mom , whether ...... she's here with you , or in Heaven .
