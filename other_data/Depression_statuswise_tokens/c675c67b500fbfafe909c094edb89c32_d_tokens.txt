sometimes you have to stop loving the most 
important person in your life .. 
not because the spark is gone , but because that person is 
unintentionally making you feel 
" WORHTLESS " 
" Laugh so hard that even sorrow smiles at you ,. 
fight so strong that even fate accepts its defeat .. 
Love so true that even hatred walks out of the way . 
Lastly , 
Live Life so well that even death Loves to see you exist .. :)) 
" falling inLOVE is like disecting a frog in your biology class ., 
they open you up , learn everything about you and then rip your 
HEART out and throw you away " ..

" if you don't understand my silence , 
you'll not understand my words .. " 
-from MUTE PEOPLE 
sabi nila , 
" you can never realize the importance of a thing until its gone .. " 
sabi ko naman .. 
" it well never be gone unless you give importance to it .. " 
right ??? 
definitely .. :)) 
I was not born to insist myself to someone who doesn't want me anymore ,.. 
I give LOVE , yes I do .. 
In fact i easily fall for someone who makes me feel special .. 
but , when i sense the person is starting to get rid of me .., 
I wont waste time .. 
I wont wait for him to neglect my presence .. 
LOVE don't fade easily but mark my words ... 
" I can contradict my feelings just to make sure I won't look stupid !!.. " 
weh ! atlast pahuway na jud ang mga bahug nawong .. hahaha :)) 
" some people might say , single persons have a sad life , 
" NO " 
they have friends that make them happy , 
some might also say , 
no one cares for them , that's also a lie .. 
the have their family who loves them .. 
but do you know why they are still single ??? 
it's because they look forward to a long term relationship 
at the right time with the right person .. 
and not for experience .. " :)) 
" if you leave something wonderful with thosewho come toy your life , 
they will surely find it hard to erase you from their hearts .. " :) 
so true .... lol ! 
A REAL AND NICE FACT : 
" wala naman mali kung aminin mong 
inlove ka sa kanya ang mali ay yung 
pilit mong tinatanggi kahit sobrang obvious na .. " 
(^tama^) .. )) 
sometimes , no matter how much i someone , 
it's still wiser not to have that person back again ,... 
less tears , 
less pain , 
much better .. =) 
gudnyt ... :) 
when you made to choose between two good things ,
