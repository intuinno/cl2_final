Why do girls have to be so cruel ? lol . 
I am feeling a whole lot better . I think I am a comedic genious . XD lol . Not really . All well . I love to feel free . 
She was crazy to think I was going to take her back . lol . Wow . lol . I am officially free . Know any girls that like my personality in Iowa ? lol .

14 days left . Oivey . If I can survive . School just kicked my ass today . I don't even know why . Oivey . 
Not to sound concieted , I think I look fucking amazing ! lol . Looks aren't everything , personality is more , but damn I think I look good . haha . My thyroid disease is the best thing to happen to me . n_n

There are 8 days left till I am 18 . yay me . 
Better . still sucks . But , idk . Everything just sucks . Happy early birthday to me . haha . Sigh . At least I got to know that there could be a girl out there for me . heh . I guess the real me isn't going to be found yet . All well . 
Sorry about all those quizes people . XD I was bored , and I just chose the ones that interested me , and the results interested me . 
oh yeah , and 6 days till my bday . 
Fucking sigh . 
Life is good , life is bad , life is funny , life is stupid . The meaning of life is to live it . For all of those feelings and more . What makes life so interesting is not knowing what is going to happen . Thats what makes life worth living . It may be bad now , but it will be good eventually . 
The pain has subsided . I am now just ready to continue as a friend . I am willing to be a friend if she is willing to be my friend . Tomorrow is my birthday . I am going to be 18 years old . I feel like I am 30 . lol . But all well . I am going to move on and just see where life takes me . I always do . And I will never stop moving . 
The ILC could be in trouble . We need all the help we can get . We need to make a petition , go to the school board , the news , everything we can to do get your story out there . We need help . Anybody who is from Indianola , that supports the ILC , please give me your help and input . We all need it . 
I am feeling better . I understand everything . I will always be there for her as a friend . I understand everything now . Kat , don't be hating yourself . It is not your fault . Not my fault . It was just not meant to be right now . I will always be there to help you . I just needed a day to myself . To just vent and think . And I always was going to be your friend . It hurt but I know it was needed . Thank you . 
I am lost . I am sad . It is the ifs and maybes that keep on getting me . I love her so much . I don't want to lose her . I just don't know if she wants to be with me anymore . How long is this going to be ? I guess it is neccessary . 
UGH ! I am so tired of the twightlight movies . Jesus . Enough already ! lol . The guys aren't even that good looking ! lol . 
Oh sigh . Better as always . I deal with things . Strangly , everytime I got dumped , instead of feeling less secure and everything , I feel even more confident that ever . haha . I am better . Still kind of sucks , but hey , thats life . :) It will get better in the end . Just got to let time run its course . 
Well , my xbox is back . I am happy for that ! I am better . I am no longer hurt . It was not her fault that she had to do with what she did . I understand . That never hurt me . Now , I am going to be her friend . I am going to be there for her if she wants me to be . 
Happy Birthday to me . :) I talked to her today . I felt better to talk to her normally . I hope we can talk more later . I want to be her friend . 
One thing after another . I am so done with everything for this year . Now the ILC could be closed next year . Sigh . I am done with shit ! Anybody from indianola , that knows about the ILC , that cares for it , help make a patiion for the school board . 
The good and the bad , I will always survive . I may seem down , but that is natural . I will always prevail in the end . That is who I am . I learn from every bad and good thing happening to me . I will always be ok in the end . 
Better day today ! Much better . Still could be better . BUT I STILL LOVE LIFE ! Being human is not just about the shit . It is also about the good , love , happyness . Etc . I don't like thinking down . Because I know there is an up . 
Don't hate me people , but I am going to cut my hair today . lol . I am tired of it . It will be gone today ! 
10 days till my bday . woot . 
I am tired of pretty much everything . Just a bunch of shit everyday ! UGHHHHHH !!! HH ! H ! H ! H ! H ! H !!!! TIRED OF IMMATURE PEOPLE ! New joey is coming into town and this joey is tell you exactly how I feel joey . I hope people like the new me . Because it is time to crack down on some people . 
Snow , snow , snow , snow , more snow , more snow , and more snow . Normal IOWA ! haha . 
Hoping to get my hair cut today . 
I guess not today . Tomorrow I guess . 
School tomorrow I am sure . All well . It was a good run . I am glad we had these days off . I needed a break from everything , everybody , just all . I am much better now tho . I may not actually kill somebody ! haha . Jk jk . I could never hurt somebody . Unless they mess with my friends , or if they phyisically attack me . Then I will hurt . 
haha , I was mistaken for a 30 year old , hahaa . So I guess my mental age is way way way older than my real age . haha . 
I wish some people could help me . I don't get out enough . I should , but I don't . all well . I just wish I had a girl who was cuddly , and nice , understanding , funny , likes things I like . She must be really hard to find . All well . It will happen . I am a great guy , and I am sure a girl will see that eventually . All well ! I am patient . I can wait . 
The reason why a xmas tree is better than a man . It stays up for 12 days , looks cute in balls , and looks good with the lights on . ( First heard from Tabitha McHugh ) 
7 days left ! Wooootwooot ! What are you all gettin me for me bday ? lol . 
Joey Benge One thing after another . I am so done with everything for this year . Now the ILC could be closed next year . Sigh . I am done with shit ! Anybody from indianola , that knows about the ILC , that cares for it , help make a patiion for the school board . 
School canceled again tomorrow . I am glad . I needed a break from that place ! 
Ok , on the friends q and a , don't take things super serious people ! It is for funzies . And fyi , I know I don't have a cute butt ! I have no but !! lol . And the answers will be shown . So I will find out who said that .... grrrr . hahaha . jk . I like my no-butt ! XD I am glad no school tomorrow , I needed a big break . 
SO ! Today was kind of sucky . I don't want to talk about it . I get frustrated easily when I am tired . hahaha . Anyway , things have gotten better . I just wish somthing else would get better . Kind of wish I had a girlfriend , and all girls are taken in that school anyway , and I don't like any of them . so , well , I am screwed . haha . 
Feeling better . a little blah but all well . 
I wish I had somebody to lay on my shoulder and to hold . I wish I had somebody to call my own . I wish , I had somebody . Every day I see how happy people are with their love , their boyfriend , girlfriends , and it makes me , how come I don't have anybody ? I am this great guy , yet I feel like I got the short end of the stick . There is like nobody for me at the ILC . Nobody . 
Omg ! * breathes deep * . Represented ilc , no other students there . ugh . I did good tho apperntly . Talked to reporter , got our story heard . * sobs * haha . I feel fucking amazing . 
I wish , I could find a girl who understands me , will stay with me for a long time . A girl that will care about me just as much as I care about her . A girl , who won't lie to me to save face . Or to omit facts . A girl who is romantic , who knows what it is like to feel alone . Why can't I find her ? I am supposedly this great guy , how comes I can find this equally great girl ? Is she even real in this society ? 
Somedays are great . Somedays suck . This was a good day . This week has been good for me . I still wish I found that special someone . But hey , there are a lot of girls out there . There is bound to be one that likes a guy like me . I just hope that really happens . Cause , somedays I wonder . 
Ok . Listening to country music , cleaning the house , moving a giant tv by myself , not fun . haha . But to me , it is ! XD I folded my clothing and am thinking about bakin the last batch of cookies . XD hahahaha . 
Is really cold right now ! haha . SO COLD ! lololol learning japanese is fun , but hard . ( thats what she said ) . XD I am in an odd mood . all wells . 
I guess it helped me with everything but that . It just annoys me somedays . But , I am not going to give up hope . I am just done looking for something that isn't there . 
The reason why a xmas tree is better than a man . It stays up for 12 days , looks cute in balls , and looks good with the lights on . 
haha , I am a lot like some of these things . 
I have a secret , guilty pleasure to tell you all . I am .... A big fan of gilmore girls . I love it ! I also love Buffy the vampire slayer , angel , and charmed . XD 
Maybe it is just the place . Maybe it isn't . Maybe it is my looks , maybe people don't like my personality . maybe I am not open enough . I really don't fucking know . but , whatever . I am done with searching for a girl . Done . 
FRIDAY ! WOOOT ! I AM A GEEK AND PROUD OF IT !!!!!!! 
sigh . I give up . haha . I give . I am done looking for that special somone . how can I find someone if there is nobody in that school to be with ? haha . I am done . I give . I will just be a bachelor till when the fuck ever . If I have a girlfriend , yay . but , fuck it . all I ever do is be who I want to be , and I guess , it doesn't matter . continued down .... 
God I am sick . XD Good day tho . It sucked to see friends in pain tho . I wanted to find out who pissed that person off , so I can kick their asses . I was in a mood where I would have said anything to anybody . I was proud of myself , but not as much as two people who spoke at the podium ! I was like holy crap ! haha . Good day . Stay away from the Kimwa . 
Oh sigh . I like my hair , even if others don't agree * cough*Hanna*cough * . :P Oh sigh . The year should be getting better soon I hope . 
Oh sigh . Not today to cut ! but tomorrow .

Happy Valentines day ! The hallmark giftcard day ! haha jk . Hallmark hates me cause I make my own cards . But seriously , today is the day to celebrate relationships that have lasted a long time , and ones that just started . That is what this day is about in my eyes . So take care of your boyfriends or girlfriends and show them that you care for them . I know I will show mine . 
sigh . Well found out my DUMB FUCKING ASS COUSIN ! YEAH YOU HEAR ME CATHY ! Got her kids taking away . YOU CALL ME SELFISH ? WHO IS THE ONE THAT CHOSE AN ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND OVER YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD ? THOSE KIDS WILL GET A GOOD HOME AND YOU NEVER DESERVED THEM ! 
FUCKING TIRED OF PEOPLE ! STUDENTS ARE JUST PATHETIC . A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS SCHOOL . FUCK EM ALL . 
I am tired of over half the students in my school . It is like they don't want to do anything anymore . They have been disrespecting the teachers , leaving whenever , a lot of people already have 5 absenses . First period In my class only one person did work . and it is just stupid . I am done with half the people in that school . I been there for 3 years , and it is rediculous . I am done with them . I am tired of it . 
Ugh . I understand why she did it . I understand really . It will take me time to get over her . I don't like being single . I want a girl like her , sweet , funny , caring , honest , trusting , and well just hasn't had a whole lot of experiance in some things . It is hard to find somebody like that . I hope someday I do . I understand . She wants something I can't give her . Long distance doesn't work . I won't let it happen again . 
Is feeling good ! Has a great person with me . and school is doing good . 
oh sigh . 
It is necessary . I know it is . It sucks but it is necessary . Sigh . I know she will be back . It is just a break . She will be back with me . I just don't like the idea of not talking to her for a few weeks . It is not what I want tho . It is what she wants . And that is all I can do is know that she will be back . 
Well . It is pretty much the truth . The ilc will probably be closed next year . They want to intagrate the school into the HS . Which , could work . If they keep the program like it is now , just in a differnt school . 
one more day then 4 day break ! WWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!! 
Oh sigh . Why do people keep on saying hey you are 18 you can go to a strip club now ? lol . I don't want to go to a strip club . XD Not that kind of guy . lol . Nore do I smoke so I don't buy ciggarettes . So idk what else to do ! lol . 
It annoyes me when girls say men suck ! Like they have a few bad things with men and then they just decide all men suck . It is like , wtf ? I am a male , and I am pretty sure I do not suck . Maybe I am biased towards myself . Idk . But still . I think I would make a great boyfriend , if just I found the kind of girl I like that likes me . haha . 
Sighs . I hate growing up . lol . now I got to worry about more things . haha 
hahahahahahahahhahahahaahhaha god I hate my life ! hahahahhaha ! XD I just found out just after three days , my ex has a guy , she says a friend , who she makes out and kisses with ! WOO ! Wow . I should have known . I mean she kissed 12 guys in 7 years . come on joey . wake up ! 
I want a girl to cuddle with , to kiss , to hang out with , and to hug . I want to experiance all of that in real life . I have paitence , and it sucks ! haha . I want that stuff . I never even really had a girlfriend . I never got to kiss , to cuddle , none of that . It is hard when I am not out there in the world , and I want to get out there in the world . Anybody want to help ? XD haha . Kinda not kidding , kind of kidding . XD

To all learning center students ! The learning Center will be put into the High School . Now all we can do is email them telling them what we would like it to look like in the Highschool . I think if they keep it relitevly the same in the High School you all will be just fine . We fought hard , we didn't fail , it just was unavoidable . So don't feel bad for what has happend . Just know you did your best . 
* sobs * Now it is over . She just wants to be a friend . She wants other people . She can't be with me anymore . * sobs * Goddamnit . Why does this shit keep on happening ? It is not fair . Why do I end up liking somebody so much and have that stripped of me ? Can't I be happy with somebody ? FUCK . I hate this .
