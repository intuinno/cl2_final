......................... why can't i focus on writing my paper AT ALL ??........................... 
[ people should just stick to treating eachother the way that they really feel about one another , even if that means giving up whatever they might gain from pretending to like someone they really don't , or having to deal with the temporary awkwardness of admitting that they made a mistake , or changed their mind ... or whatever . just a thought . ]
