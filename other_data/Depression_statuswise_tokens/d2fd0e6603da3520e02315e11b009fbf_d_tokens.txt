Yesterday I discovered the origins of the saying , ' the cake is a lie . ' 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post .
