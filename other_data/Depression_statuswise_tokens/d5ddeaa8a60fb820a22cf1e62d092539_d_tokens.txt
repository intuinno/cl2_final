" ... But when it comes to human beings , the only type of cause that matters is final cause , the purpose . What a person had in mind . Once you understand what people really want , you can't hate them anymore . You can fear them , but you can't hate them , because you can always find the same desires in your own heart . "

Introspection is crucial for inner strength and the power of seeking true humility . For humility can never be achieved successfully without true introspection . To be humble is to truly see ourselves as powerful but insignificant . It is this yin and yang that tests us daily .

Love is not breathlessness , it is not excitement , it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion . That is just being " in love " which any of us can convince ourselves we are . Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away , and this is both an art and a fortunate accident . - St. Augustine
