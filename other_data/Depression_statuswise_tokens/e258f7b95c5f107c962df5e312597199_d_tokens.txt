Lost two more cadets and a SeeD today . I had to help some guys get to the infirmary so I'm getting ready to try and find the van to get more supplies for the nurses . And I dearly miss the cooking back home ._. I've been spoiled with coming home to a warm meal waiting for me . 

Any news on your end ? And are you sure you don't want me to take a day trip , Yuna Fayth Suzuki ? 
I wish our uniforms were warmer ._. I'm freezing my ass off . They tell me that I'm going to be up and out on the field at 6 AM until ' ?? ' Since I'm on night watch again until 11 ( they're letting me sleep tonight ! ) , maybe Yuna Fayth Suzuki could give me a call and let me talk to the kids and her ...? 
GOING TO SLEEP IN 3 MINUTES !! I want sleep sooooo badly . Though , it was really nice talking to Yuna Fayth Suzuki , Lennon and Luna . See you guys the 3rd !! 
* bangs head against wall * I .... CAN'T .... SLEEP ... 
Going to try and sleep ... or at least just lay in bed . x_x 
Pssssst , did you know that Tidus Ahh Taylor is a dickless ass ? 
As requested by Yuna Fayth Suzuki . An update . 
Well , today as I was out on the field and a swarm of unicorns made of chocolate rained down . I was surrounded by these chocolate fiends ; it looked as though I was done for . But someone across the field cast firagra and melted the unicorns . I still don't know who my savior is , I believe he was a giant glittering turtle . 
Okay , seriously now . 
Three more guys were killed today ; two more injured . I've been out on the field all day fighting and I'm tired as hell . And they tell me that Friday-Sunday I'm doing re-con and leading an invasion . Please , try not to worry anymore , Yuna Fayth Suzuki , but that means no calling/texting or anything with me this weekend . 
Well , last night I gave a certain girl a surprise visit . I thought that since I won't be able to talk with her this weekend I might as well come visit . Had a very fun night with Yuna Fayth Suzuki . I took the LONGEST shower when I got up <3 It feels great to be home . 
The invasion was a complete success ; in fact , it was so successful that I'm coming home Thursday . That's right , I'M COMING HOME THE 24TH !! Can't wait to be able to sleep well , eat good food and be awakened by kids jumping on my bed . 
I'll be home 8 days earlier , good news , Yuna Fayth Suzuki ? 
Così , ho adottato un bambino italiano ... il suo nome è apparentemente Itay . Così i thats un altro ragazzo alla mia lunga lista dei bambini . 
What have I missed ? When did Rena Lynette Leonhart grow up so much ? I am such a terrible parent ._. 
Okay , Sora Strife-Awaiosonoankoku ... maybe it IS a bad idea to allow Denzel Awaiosonoankoku to watch Metalocalypse ................. 
Apparently , if mine and Yuna Fayth Suzuki's relationship doesn't work ... Cløud Strife-Fair is going to snap my dick off ._. 
Night all , going to sleep with my beautiful girlfriend Yuna Fayth Suzuki . <3 
Going to go cook dinner for me and Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
Yes , I know you all are happy to have me back but please stop standing outside my bedroom door and singing ' In The Jungle ' while I'm trying to sleep . Yes , haha . Very funny . 
Because it'll embarrass Yuna Fayth Suzuki . Yuna just sat on my lap and bounced for me and kissed me sexily ... bra-less . 
Thinks Paine Sabbath is a SEXY Bitch ... Shhh Don't tell Yunie ... : x 
" Do YOU like to bounce on MY sexy lap ? " -Yuna Fayth Suzuki 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki , if we have ANY more kids and if one is a boy I am naming him Leonardo . And that is that . :D 
So , yeah . I'm getting my own show because I'm psychic . It's gonna be called ' That's so Squall ' 
D: BUT Cløud Strife-Fair , I DON'T WANT TO GO TO AN AA MEETING !!!!!!! Yuna Fayth Suzuki CONTROL YOUR BESTIE !! 
Pssst , Yuna Fayth Suzuki ... I love you . 
" They never break down- but I do ! " -Maytag guy on Robot Chicken 
I will be a good father . I will not kill my idiot daughter . I will be a good father . I will not kill my idiot daughter . I will be a good father . I will not kill my idiot daughter .

VIII DOES NOT LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF VII !! 
It's Final Fantasy South Park month . -nods- 
I understand that it is a kind gesture , but Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku , please stop inviting me too your 3 AM trips to Wall Market . It's not cool to call me at 2:30 to ask me if I want to go . 
" I saw you smiling at me , was it real or just my fan-TASY ? " -Yuna Fayth Suzuki ( I <3 you :D ) 
Go to Google Translate copy and paste " äääääääääääääää " and translate from German to Turkish , the result ? The meaning of life . 
Come on , Yuna Fayth Suzuki and Irvine Kinneas ... join us South Parkians . 
Night all . School/Work tomorrow . Going to try and help Irvine Kinneas and Zell Dincht study for their exams . 
Is at GARDEN trying to get Irvine Kinneas and Zell Dincht to focus on studying . 
No , Yuna Fayth Suzuki . You had your chance . GTFO of my cocoon . 
Okay , I am really enjoying scrolling down and seeing all the South ... Enix ... characters . XD

Is done working on South Park peeps today . It's 2:30 . 
Okay , it's 3:09 . Bed time for me and Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
Has eggrolls . 
Dear Fish-headed horse

Sincerely , Squall 
Is gonna whip Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku's ass at some video games . 
You just can't trust them Bi-SEX-u-als .... 
Pssst , Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart ... I love you . 
I <3 you , Raion . 
Oh , and Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart XD 
Okay , I have to start being happier , louder , funnier , nicer and more adorable . 
-nods- 
is going to sleep at 4:30 AM on a school/work night . Yeah , I'm going to be paying for this . 
Lunch break at Garden . By the time I got to sleep my alarm went off , though it was worth it I had quite a night with Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart . 
// Squallsdead.com ...... I think ... my .... mind ... it's .... been blown ...... IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW !!!!!! 
... so ... Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku is convinced I suffer from Abandoned Child Syndrome . Please tell me someone disagrees . 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart is distracting me from my work . 
I hate writing essays . ._. Dammit , Garden ! 
So ... yeah , FFVIII ... I'm dead . O.o holy shit , man . 
Nooooooooooooo ! I've seen the Aqua Teen a million times D: 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart : " ? Dude , dude , dude , OMG ! He's so sexy ! Sexy , sexy ! ? * continues with song * " 
You and I wake up in bed together .. Using five words , what would you say to me ? ** Note : if you comment , you must repost this as your status . 
... the sad truth is ... I'm whipped ... ._. 
... hmm , well ... it's 4:43 AM ... my alarm will go off a 5 ... -facepalm- Why the hell do I keep doing this ? 
Okay , so no work tomorrow . That means I have the whole day to be on strike . 
No work todaaay ! I'm gonna sleep iiiiiin , it's 5:19 AMMMMM . Gonna have a good day in my cardboard- OHMYGOD !!! 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart , 6:48 PM . 
When you fail too much for a facepalm , the only thing left too do is ... -headdesk- 
I could reallllllllly go for a cigarette right about now ... and a drink ._. Okay , so this whole ' quitting smoking and drinking ' thing is going to be harder than I thought ... 
ADIDAS . That is all . 
Jecht Taylor : AND BLAH-DE-LA-DE-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH . 
Due to my alcohol and cigarette withdrawal I have fallen back onto sugar ... and how I love you , Sugar ... 
Me : " Hey , Yuna , wanna see my sexy hair flip ? " 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart : " Yeah . " 
Me : -flips hair- " Sexy , huh ? " 
Yuna : " No . " 
//Me and Jecht Taylor were in the kitchen being manly trying to find something to snack on , I guess Jecht slid ( but caught his balance ) when I had my back turned and when I asked him what happened he reenacted it and then fell . I feel better about tripping now . XD 
I want Dairy Queen ... damn you , Dairy Queen ... why aren't you close too my house ? 
<--- Going to be stuck in a car with Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku and Jecht Taylor . Thank Shiva , I'm going to have Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart with me . She will be the only thing keeping me from killing the other two . 
Well , I survived the drive , turns out that Jecht Taylor is a terrible driver and Laguna Loire drives like an old man . Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku wanted to get there early and early we were ._. 
I'M NOT PARANOID OR INSECURE . 
Got an exam Monday , got to train some cadets after that , giving a tour of GARDEN to some new recruits , then I have to help out with Selphie's festival , help Irvine study and go over Zell's paper + classes thrown in there and I've got to get home make time for Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart and the kids ... 
I am reallllllly missing my Marlboro . 
Hey , Benjamin Viktor Williams , why don't we leave Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart and forget about her and run off together . ;) Because you know I'd like that :D 
Unicorns eat hummus for their metabolism and tortillas for horn upkeep/growth . And they only share their food with their mates . Right , Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart ? And mermaidunicorns exist . 
My exam went by fast , me and the cadets got some training in , Quistis gave the tour for me , the meeting for the festival was postponed , Irvine said he had the studying under control , I went over Zell's paper , one class was canceled because the instructor called in sick at the last minute and the other classes went by fast . It's good being home early . 
" If you love video games , why not make it a career ? Lead Game Testers can earn as much as $60 , 00 a year ! Learn more here . " 
WELL , DAMN ! IF I CAN MAKE $60.00 A YEAR ... 
._. So ... much ... competition ... dammit , Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart , stop being so irresistible ! 
Is heading off to work . 
I love you Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart 
I swear if one more cocky cadet addresses me as ' Commander Fagot ' or ' Commander Gay-ass ' I am beating them to a bloody fucking pulp . 
<3 <3 <3 <3 Loves Rena-Lynette Leonhart soooooo much , and I'm going to cuddle her and hug her and kiss her and love her nonstop when I get home . <3 <3 <3 <3 
Selphie wants to throw me a party ... because 2011 means I've been with Garden for twenty years . ._. I hate parties ... 
Is watching Lovely Bones ; making me fucking sick . 
I NEVER had sex , smoked weed , skipped class , snuck out , or been drunk . Post this as your status and whoever likes it thinks your lying about one or all of them 
... Angeal Hewley and Prétty Príncéss Taylor are arguing about whats better : honor or Blitzball ... what a wonderful discussion going on at SEplayhouse . * facepalm * 
SeeD or SOLDIER ? 
Prétty Príncéss Taylor sent me this over chat 
~ ( >:| ) --|---< 
I had to share it with you . It kinda reminds me of Auron Ishikawa ... 
Awww ... it's okay if Raion doesn't love you , Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart ... I still love you . <3 
Why is my pussy so wet ? 
YOU PASS OUT AND LATER YOU WAKE UP TO FIND OUT THAT YOUR MARRIED TO ME AND THAT WE ARE ON OUR HONEYMOON ....... using only 3 words . What would you say to me ? Note : If you comment you must copy and paste this as your status , so i may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport . Play along ... 
Gave Yuna some money , sent her and Cloud out for a day to do whatever since she's been feeling stressed . I cleaned the kitchen and I am currently doing the laundry . 
Really hates getting cockblocked by Cløud Strife-Fair and his damn texting Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
Tomorrow marks me being sober and smoke free for ten days . It's seemed longer than that ... maybe because it's been hell ... 
DON'T DRINK OR SMOKE . IT'S A BITCH TO STOP . 
I <3 Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
<-- had a chocolate craving and is now eating white chocolate , milk chocolate , milk chocolate and peanut butter and butterscotch baking chips . 
Yeah , I've got Yuna Fayth Suzuki eating right out of the palm of my hand . Literally . 
Imma pretty butterfly 
Hey , Cløud Strife-Fair , Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku , Zack Fair , Genesis Rhapsodos and Angeal Hewley ... SeeD is better than SOLDIER ! Stick that in your potion and suck it ! 
Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia 
The fear of long words . 
Attention , Dylan Holmes 
In case you didn't know , as a SeeD I am highly trained in poking wars . 
I will win . 
-S . Leonhart 
Dammit , Raion . Eat the chip . 
Reality isn't so kind . Everything doesn't work out the way you want it to . That's why ... as long as you don't get your hopes up , you can take anything ... you feel less pain . 
Why can't I take my own advice ? I'm such a moron . 
... is heading out to GARDEN . Sleeping in my dorm tonight ... 
Is in my GARDEN dorm ... probably going to try and sleep ... long work day tomorrow ... night everyone . 
... I can't sleep ... it doesn't feel right ... sleeping alone ... 
I can't get my fucking life together . Someone , please , I want gun to my head . 
Cid called me to his office today . 
He told me to take the rest of the day off . 
Then he said " April Fools !! " 
Instead he's sending me out to Dollet for a mission tomorrow . 
I'm going to be sent out to Dollet tomorrow morning . I haven't been given a return date yet . 
That should give you some time ... to think some things through , Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
... well ... the mission to Dollet turned out to be an assassination attempt plotted by Sephiroth ... 
Well , nice to know he wants me dead ... 
I feel so drained . 
Back in my dorm at GARDEN ; working on reports and studying . 
<-- Doing homework . 
Nothing lasts in this world . Someday you're bound to lose everything . Everybody around you will be gone . Then what are you left with ? Nothing . Nobody ... It's so miserable . And it's inevitable . It's so hard to recover from something like that . I never ever want to deal with that again . I can't . Even if it means being alone ... 
//Well , since Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku killed me , I suppose I'm off to bed ! 
When tomorrow starts without me , and Im not there to see , 
If the sun should rise and find your eyes all filled with tears for me ; 
I wish so much you wouldnt cry the way you did today , 
while thinking of the many things we didnt get to say . 
I know how much you care for me , and how much I care for you , 
and each time that you think of me I know youll miss me too ; 
Is finally back . 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart , I WANT TO MARRY YOU TODAY :3 I LOVE YOU THAT MUCH . YOU MAKE ME SUCH A SOFTY ! :3 
Is choosing to be the adult and ignoring Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku . 
._. I sense cat-fights in my near future ... 
Me e Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonharta sono andare in Italia , per gentile concessione di Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku . Così , ho deciso ho bisogno di rispolverare il mio italiano . 
" Simply Wood Rings : An eco-conscious artisan shop creating wooden wedding rings made from salvaged wood . On your special day , give her wood ! " 
I won't be getting Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart a wooden ring but I will be giving her ' wood ' . :P 
( Sorry , baby ... it was too tempting to pass up ) 
//Goodnight . 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki-Leonhart , you need to be going to sleep . YOU ARE SICK . GET YOUR REST . 
... Rena-Lynette Leonhart is my daughter , of course she's my daughter ... she's mine and Reno Quinton Atakawashi-Shinra daughter ... Rufus Shinra isn't her father ... of course he's not ... 
Work today was tiring . We had the SOLDIERS and Turks over today , I hate to admit it but ... they can fight ... just not as good as SeeD . 
CALL OF DUTY : BLACK OPS . 
It's addicting . 
Is now the proud father of Lockett and Leona Leonhart . <3 
<3 Yuna Fayth Leonhart <3 
* insert witty hipster remark here * 
Yuna Fayth Leonhart : Oh , my ! Oh , my ! <3 
The word ' wow ' is too mainstream . I use the word ' wowerlaaderando ' instead . 
Dammit , Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku !! Stop trying to rape Yuna Fayth Leonhart !! 
//Offline , Going out with Yuna Fayth Leonhart and Sephirøth Awaiosonoankoku . Be back late . 
People are always telling me " If you don't have anything nice to say , don't say anything at all " then they wonder why I'm so quiet . 
YEAHHHH !!! NEW YEARS AND DRUNK AS HELL !!!! XD IMMA PARTY PARTYING WITH ZELL , QUISTIS , IRVINE , YUNA , TIDUS , JECHT AND EVERYONE ELSE TO WHOM I DID NOT LIST !!!!!!! GONNA BE A GOOD YEAR !!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!!!!!!!!

Eating a quick dinner with the SeeDs and then back to the mission . They decided to split the group up so Irvine , Zell and Selphie all got transfered . At least I don't have to deal with the two drunken idiots anymore . How's everything over there , Yuna Fayth Suzuki ?

Hope everyone is doing good , it's hell out here but I'll be home Sunday ( hopefully ) The one thing about Deling , there's no snow !! I've forgotten what grass and sidewalks look like ! I'm sorry I didn't give a update sooner , Yuna Fayth Suzuki . I'm trying . Tell the kids hi for me . 
Was just informed I'm going to be on night watch until 3 AM , so Yuna Fayth Suzuki feel free to text me . 
Okay , again . I apologize to ANYONE I talked to last night , and I also apologize for the ' drunk posts ' . I will try not to let it happen again 
Family Guy , you so funny . 
Jecht Taylor is a immature cry-baby . 
2:45 AM or so HQ was attacked and took an hour to get under control Lunch right now and I might try to take a 5 minute nap . Going off about 4 hours off sleep and I get to work night watch again And when I asked about the earliest time to leave they said " Actually you can probably leave Thursday ... the 3rd . " So now it's looking like I'm not coming home until March . 
See you the 3rd , Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
! DEPRESSION ALERT ! I , Squall Leonhart , ' main ' character of Final Fantasy VIII , one of the most hated FF's , am depressed that VII got a prequel/sequel and a movie , X got a sequel , and some other FF's got remakes . And now , after living in the ever looming shadow of VII , it seemed as though one game out-shined VII , and that was XIII . And now , XIII is getting a sequel . ._. I think I'm dying . 
Well , mission briefing is over . The ever moronic Irvine Kinneas and Zell Dincht decided to go out drinking . I'm staying back at HQ and studying on the mission . Hopefully I can sleep tonight , early day tomorrow . And I'm going to try to keep you updated , Yuna Fayth Suzuki , so you won't worry so much . 
My head still hurts ... 
? + ? 
Thats right , Irvine Kinneas-Leonhart , I stole your sock . What now !? 
I apologize to anyone I talked to last night , and disregard any posts from last night . I had a little too much /eggnog/

Finally got to Deling , me and the SeeDs went out and got some food and is now waiting for the mission briefing . I have a feeling it's going to be a loooong week . 
Because I probably won't be on tomorrow , 
Happy Valentine's Day Reno Quinton Atakawashi-Leonhart , Yuna Fayth Suzuki , Cløud Strife-Fair ! Can you all tell the kids Happy V-day for me ? And everyone else ? 
Just two more hours and I can sleep for awhile . Night watch is so boring . Thanks for keeping me ' company ' Yuna Fayth Suzuki . But seriously , if your tired to to sleep , you need your rest . :P

Just got back to HQ the enemy slashed our vans tires so me and 2 cadets had to carry as much of the supplies from the van back to HQ . Irvine called and told me that Galbadia is sending in some recruits . We lost a cadet out on the battlefield today I couldn't stop his bleeding enough to get him to the infirmary I blame myself I should have done more 
Give me something to smile about , Yuna Fayth Suzuki . 
17 hours and counting . Still a long night ahead . Been out on the battlefield for at least 13 hours . They sent two more SeeDs and quite a few lower ranks . I didn't know this mission was going to take a turn for the worst . 
Yuna Fayth Suzuki tell the kids I love you guys and that everything is going to be okay .
