Heartache doesn't ever really go away ; not even with time , it simply dims into a background noise , always threatening to pull you under if you listen too closely . 
Did you know you can disable people from being able to comment on your wall ? Weird .

Well Im not the type who gets voted Most likely to be victimized by those old butterflies but you're the exception your love is infectious . The fever s climbing high . 
11 hour shifts are retarded 
I remember why I used to only sleep during the day . Worst nightmare ever . Too many lately . They're beginning to make sleeping a chore . Even when exhaustion hits . 
I don't know what I want , So don't ask me , ' cause I'm still trying to figure it out . Don't know what's down this road , I'm just walking , Trying to see through the rain coming down ....

Sick of the nightmares 
Why are all of the statuses so sad tonight ?? 
Bedtime . <3 
I don't think I've ever smiled so much such shortly after doing something sooo stupid . 
Hey hey stomach , why such a jerk today man ? 
You've already won me over , in spite of me . And don't be surprised if I fall head over feet . 
Every one is quoting the movie the wedding date lately .. Even on bumper stickers ... What's up with that ? 
I remembered my twitter password ! Now I can stop annoying all of you lovely people 
Doesn't understand the concept of " pokes " I just know that if it says you " poked me " I'm going to " poke " you back . IN A COMPLETELY NOT DIRTY WAY . Just saying ... 
Oh lord CC , why do you do the things you do ? 
Headphones full blast and a good book sounds like the perfect escape right now ... 
Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones , as wind puts out candles yet fans fires . 
Like this status and I will reply with one amazing quality I think you have . But I warn you : If you like this , I expect an honest to God response saying one thing you DISLIKE about me underneath it in a comment . It's a strange contrast , but if you're my friend , you're the ones I will listen to and need to hear it from :) 
God . I hate this person so freaking much ... asfrliajskl ; fwaehotihwaen 
Meggie : " You've been to Persia then ?? " Elinor : " Yes , a hundred times . Along with St. Petersburg , Paris , Middle Earth , distant planets and Shangri-la . And I never had to leave this room . Books are adventure . They contain murder , mayhem and passion . And they love anyone who opens them . " <3 
Love for some one isn't like other things that you can put in your pocket with the intent to save it for some rainy day . Don't miss your chance . Share it while you have it . Let it flourish , don't let it smolder and waste away until you lose it . 
When I lay tonight ... When I close my eyes ... I know the sun will rise ... Here or the next life ... As long as you're still mine ... 
Haha my cat just tried crawling into an empty chip bag and got stuck , it was pretty entertaining . 
Today is a good day . =) 
The show Two and a Half Men never fails to make me laugh <3 
I wish I could not wear pants without it being inappropriate sometimes =/ 
So , I'm pimping out Alexx Harrison , Eren Dainjer Watts and Heather Marie Goers . Any takers ? They're a bit expensive but worth the money if you like the upscale hookers for like presidents . <3 you 
If some one isn't listening , you just can't make them hear ... 
I forgot Tim Curry played Rooster in Annie ... Weird 
My last status lies , my bff is katiemae ;) 
Can't you tell KatieMae had my phone ? 
I hate you every single second of the day ... There's always that nagging twinge . But at the same time I love you just the same for every second and more , because my watch finds extra seconds in the day just for you . 
Shake weight = epic fail 
I love it when you're fighting with some one and you're getting upset , then you get the most random message from some one else that is really nice and makes you feel so much better . 
I've given a lot of thoughts to the nights we used to have . The days have come and gone . Or lives went by so fast . 
Did I miss something ? Was I not just yelled at to hurry up for two both to say " wait , I need to change " ? 
Sing me something soft . Sad and delicate . Our loud and out of key .... Sing me anything ..... 
I wish I lived in the biblical times as esther of persia 
Shoot me ? Please ?

I love the crazy conversations I have with my momma sometimes 
Go purple ! Yeah 
It never really clicked that the song " the Escape " ( The pina colada song ) was about adultery ... It's kind of weird that it's princess Fiona's song in Shrek on that little like dating thing . 
Sometimes , when one person is missing , the whole world seems depopulated . - Lamartine 
Breathe . Just breathe . Take the world off your shoulders and put it on me . 
I can't wait for the snow . I need a beautiful sight to show me how beautiful the world is again . 
If one more person tries to talk to me about a bun in a certain someone's oven I might hit them . Jsyk . Because truthfully , I could care less . That ship has long since sailed and I don't care . 
I ran into a tree and the tree won 
If I had a world all my own , everything would be nonsense . 
Really right now ? Really ? 
Wants to dance in the current thunderstorm 
Is no longer blonde =D 
Don't let past experiences cloud your judgement when it comes to something similar with others . Some situation and decision that lead you astray in the past may have been completely wrong for you but it could be completely right for some one else now . Give it a chance . Don't boo on some one else's parade because something booed on yours . Try being happy for them and it'll translate into your own life <3 
Run , baby run . Don't ever look back . 
I love it when people are dicks <3 
I feel like half of my soul is wandering away from me . exploring . I hope it comes back soon . Idk what to do without it 
Had a pretty awesome night last night with KatieMae Knopp , Kristen Singleton , Elle Socrates and Kara Horstmann . But not Sabrina Trnina Acovski or Monica Brady-Barnard because they didn't show up * COUGH*COUGH * 
So , I'm pretty sure I could watch the movie the Proposal five times in a row and still laugh every single time 
I don't understand this whole poking concept . I never see them until a million years later and I don't really look at them . I just press poke back . Then they poke me back then the whole vicious cycle starts all over again . * shakes head * 
Because I've heard it said that every mushroom cloud has a silver lining . 
I just don't understand how you can smile with all those tears in your eyes and tell me everything is wonderful now 
I wish there were words to express how mad I am at you right now . 
" There's alot of assholes.in this city , you can't just go around setting them all on fire ! " " Why not ? " 
thinks Jenny Choate is the most charming person ever <3 lol 
I love psychos . They're awesome . 
All sure things fall 
If one more person walks into my room and turns my light on we might have a problem 
Goodnight world <3 
I wish I could change my hair color depending on my mood like Tonks ... That'd be sweet . I hate being confined to just one for a month . 
About 10 hours <3 
I <3 Eren Dainjer Watts she's the bestest :D 
No one sings like Bing Crosby nowadays =/ 
Play these records and think of me , I'll wish on mars and think of you . 
<3 about to be the best day ever =) 
I got your runaway smile in my piggy bank baby 
" ... I wish none of this had happened . " " So do all who live to see such times , but that is not for them to decide . All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us . 
-LOTR <3 
Always a comforting quote . Goodnight . 
Where the hell is a reset button 
Sometimes you have to forget how you feel , and remember what you deserve . 
It's a lyrically capturing day ... 
Oh holy jesus ... 
Next time I go to saginaw I'm definitely getting me some good ' ole Eudici's pizza and bread sticks ... I miss it 
Cleaning my room and going through boxes of toys and stuff to donate sounds pretty good right now 
" Christmas gift suggestions : To an enemy , forgiveness . To an opponent , tolerance . To a friend , your heart . To a customer , service . To all , charity . To every child , a good example . To yourself , respect . " 
Guess what guys ! I have a beautiful smile and no cavities . It's bedtime . 
Never be afraid to try something new . Remember , amateurs built the ark , and professionals built the titanic . 
I <3 Alexx Harrison she is the bestest most amazing person in the world !!! 
I <3 Heather Marie Goers she's the bestest person !!! 
I don't get many things right the first time . In fact , I am told that a lot . Now I know all the wrong turns , the stumbles and falls brought me here 
Misses Rams horn with Kara Horstmann , KatieMae Knopp , Kristen Singleton and Elle Socrates . 
=/ 
Isn't sure she fits in any way anywhere 
Listen to the drummer who strikes a different beat within you . 
How bright the morning that warms the afternoon . How rich the evening whose cloak reveals the moon . How pure the darkness that greets the breaking dawn . How sweet the silence just before the song . 
Yay for ear aches 
Raise your hopeful voice , you have a choice . 
Thinking of changing my number . 
Make haste , I feel your heart beat 
The way words that you say just fall like rain , I'm drowning in the sounds of your invitation 
had an amazing night with the loves of my life . Chrissy Eller , Jenny Choate , KatieMae Knopp , Kristen Singleton and Ricky Knopp . <3 
" Fairy tales can come true 
You gotta make ' em happen , it all depends on you " 
You meet thousands of people and none of them really touch you . And then , you meet that one person , and your life is changed forever . <3 
I can't help it if you look like an angel , can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain so , come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you . Can't help it if there's no one else ... I can't help myself . <3 
Taquitos !!! 
TOTALLY watching Finding Atlantis on the History Channel Sunday night . 
Today is an awesome day for self esteem =/ 
Just cut off about 3 inches of hair =) 
If you need to fall apart , I can mend a broken heart . If you need to crash , then crash and burn . You're not alone . <3 
I have often walked down this street before , but the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before . 
" Will you walk a little faster ? " Said a whiting to a snail . 
Heads carolina , tails california . 
Right after I meet some one , they show up on my suggested friends list ... Crazy ! 
... I dyed my hair almost back to my exact natural hair color ... It's soooooo weird . 
Everyone wants to be your sun that lights up your life . But I'd rather be your moon , so I could shine on you in your darkest hour when your sun isn't around . 
Love is like an hourglass , with the heart filling up as the brain empties . 
It'll be alright again 
Today is gonna be a good day . =) 
Ohhhhh boy . 
If I could be any part of you , I'd be your tears . To be conceived in your heart , born in your eyes , live on your cheeks , and die on your lips ... 
What's a song I should download ? 
Awesome . 
" Holy Shit Batman ! " - Momma Choate about 5 seconds ago ... I love my mom . 
Needs to invest in a copy of Fanboys

God is amazing and definitely working in my life today . Grateful for today . 
So , I lost my phone . And it's on silent , not even vibrate . Yay ! lol 
Watchin ' Babar : The Movie , =D 
So I lay my head back down , and I lift my hands and pray 
And we'll go spinning around the room , And dance with our hearts on fire , ' Cause every song is ours tonight 
Had a great night/morning . Actually , weekend . Finally bedtime . =) 
Sooo nervous . I really hope tomorrow turns out good . 
Somehow , I knew something bad was going to happen today . </3 
What I need now is some one to sing me an Irish lullaby and rub my back until I fall asleep ... =/
