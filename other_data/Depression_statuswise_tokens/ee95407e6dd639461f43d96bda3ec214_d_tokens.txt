Missing someone badly ... 
It feels bad to be away from your Valentine on this special day ... 
aaya mausam dosti ka .... 
When we love , it isn't because the person's perfect , it's because we learn to see an imperfect person perfectly ... 
Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves .... 
Missing everyone badly ... 
I wish I was with my friends , or in a pg , atleast at home ... Its soooo boring here ... 
Sister week !!!!! if u have a sister who has made u laugh , wiped ur tears , hugged u tight , watched u succeed , made u mad , cheered on you , kept u strong .. copy and paste this 2ur status , i did so because i have the best sisters in the world !!!!!!!. 
Although you are very happy but you are scared too at the same time 
6 Months and 10 Days ... A long time indeed ... 
I Love Walking In Rain .... Because Nobody Can See Me Crying ! 
nagme hain , sikwe hain , kisse hain , baatein hain ... 
baatein bhul jaati hain ... yaadein yaad aati hain ... 
" You come to love not by finding the perfect person , but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly . " 
True friends never go out from our life easily ... 
But , when it happens , they will come back at right time without expectations ...
