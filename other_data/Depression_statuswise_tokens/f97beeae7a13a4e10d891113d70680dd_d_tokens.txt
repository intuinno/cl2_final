Lot of things go 
unquestioned 
lot of things 
unanswered 
Some feelings r 
burried alive 
Some are born dead . 
“This is life” 
" D Most critical moment in life " 
" when some1 very spcl hurts u so deep , causes tears in ur eyes , n asks , " wat happened ..? " 
but u jst reply " NOTHING " 
Yipeeeeeee ..... celebrating second diwali !!! 
Our Indians are often hailed as great mathematicians ever since they invented the number " 0 " which lead to the rise of infinite numbers . When the number " 0 " has got so much of importance in the History of Mathematics , why do people criticize us when we secure a " 0 " in our academics ??? ;) :P 
Confused n irritated !!! 
Prabhas is reallyy Mr. Perfect !!! 
" I trust U " is a better compliment than " I LOVE U " because U may not always trust the person U Love , but U always Love the person U trust .

People Who Meet You 
In The Journey 0f Life

From You 

... But 
There Are Some Idiots 
Who Expect Nothing More 
Than You 
They Are Your

Love sees sharply , hatred sees even more sharp , but Jealousy sees the sharpest for it is love and hate at the same time .. 
Life teaches you to love and teaches you to cry , it may be ironic but its true that you can't know the value of love until you cry for it . 
A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend . A successful woman is one who can find such a man . 
You've seen me laugh 
You've seen me cry 
And always you were there with me 
I may not have always said it 
But 
thanks and I love you Father 
??? Happy Father's Day ???

There is a miracle called Friendship 
that dwells within the heart 
and you don't know how it happens 
or when it even starts . 
But the happiness it brings you 
always gives a special lift 
and you realize that Friendship 
is God's most precious gift . 
I believe in angels , 
The kind that heaven sends , 
I am surrounded by angels , 
But I call them friends . 
Dedicated to all my friends ??? Happy Friendship Day ???
