“So have no fear of them , for nothing is covered that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known . What I tell you in the dark , say in the light , and what you hear whispered , proclaim on the housetops . And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell . " - Matthew 10:26 -28

... rejoices in pains and trials ... if only to know Christ more and 
more ...

" You have sown much ,

And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes ... Why ? declares the Lord of hosts . Because

his own house . "
