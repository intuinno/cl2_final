All about a Girl .. 
When she suddenly becomes quiet , she is sad n expecting love .. 
When she is not arguing , she is thinking deeply .. 
When she calls u everyday , she is seeking ur attention .. 
When she messages u everyday , she wants u to reply atleast once .. 
When she says I Love You , she means it .. 
When she says I Miss You , no one in this world can miss u more than her .. 
Girls r always special .. Never take her wrong :) 
Affection is easy to obtain .. But once its gained , it is difficult to maintain and once its lost , it can never be regained .. So Care for the one who Cares for you ... :) :)

Cute Attitude of a gal : --> I am not waiting for a King .. I am waiting for the one who thinks that I am his Queen ...!!! :) :) 
" Remember , today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday ... " - Dale Carnegie .. 
The Happiest feeling ever is to know that a person has all the opportunity to be anywhere in the world , but they choose to be with You .. :) :)

The cause of all our personal problems and nearly all the problems of the world can be summed up in a single sentence : Human life is very deep , and our modern dominant lifestyle is not .

A fantastic thought for Lifetime ... 
" Respect the person Who Expects a Smile from You .. 
And 
Surprise the person Who has not Expected anything from You .. " :) :) 
" Sanju Weds Geetha " ... :( :( Nice N Sweet story .. But never seen such a tragedy movie till now ... :( :( :( Seriously getting Depressed after watching it .. :( :( :( 
Always try to make some time free for your loved ones even in your busy schedules ... 
because , 
one day you will have free time but not your Loved ones with you ... 
An Ultimate fact of Life .. 
" The day your Best ones stop bringing their problems to You , Is the day You have lost your Name from their hearts .. " .. :) :) 
Pain is not felt on the day u Miss ur Loved ones .. 
It's really felt when 
You Live each day without them and with their Memories in ur Heart .. :( :( 
A Next Generation Nursery Rhyme .. 
" Johny Johny , Yes Paapa .. 
Using Facebook ? Yo Paa ! 
Passing Comments ? LoL Paa ! 
Getting Likes ? WoW Paa ! 
What's ur Relationship Status ? 
Ha Ha Ha ... :) :) :) .. " .. :) :) 
Commitment doesn't mean Sticking to Someone when one has no Choice .. 
But It means Sticking to that Someone , Inspite of having several Choices .. :) :) 
Everyone says Love hurts , but that isn't true . Loneliness hurts . Rejection hurts . Losing someone hurts . Envy hurts . Everyone gets these things confused with Love , but in reality Love is the only thing in this world that covers up all Pain and makes someone feel Wonderful again . Love is the only thing in this world that does not Hurt ... :) :) 
Love is , when you take away the Feeling , the Passion , the Romance and you find out you still Care for that person .. « smile » « smile »

It takes around 2 years to learn to Speak .. 
But It Takes a Lifetime To learn Wat not to Speak .. :) :) 
Kandilla yaaru aa devarannu .. 
Irabahudo eno ninnanthe avanu .. 
Geleya andare adaku hattiraa .. 
Iniya andare adaku yettara .. 
Oragi kollalenu ninna yedege omme naanu ? 
Karagi hogalenu ninna karagalalli naanu ? 
Kadalelllava ale sutthuva tharave .....

" Worrying does not Reduce yesterday's Sorrows .. 
But it Empties today's Strength .. " 
So don't Worry , Keep Smiling Alwayss .. :) :) 
LIFE is like a RIVER 
which have many TURNS .. 
So .. 
Enjoy every TURNS .. 
Because these TURNS never RETURNS .. :) :) 
Keep Smiling .. :) :) 
A Best Person is one who , 
" Excuses before you say Sorry .. " 
" Understands before you Explain .. " 
" Waits Forever when you say Just a minute .. " 
" Stays with you when you say Leave me alone .. "

" The First Person Who comes to your Mind When You want to Share Something Special with someone is Your Best Relation .. " .. :) :) 
True Relations have the most Unique Character like SALT ... 
Their presence is never Felt , 
But Their Absence makes all the Things Tasteless ... :) :) 
Purity of a Relationship between two is not about Smiling after reading the Message .. 
Its about Smiling just by seeing the Name .. :) :) 
Admire those who give time to u in their Schedule .. 
Love those who don't see their Schedule when u Need them .. :) :) 
Love Someone Soooooo much that even God wonders whether I " Created " these creatures in my Heaven or Are they the ones , " Recreating " me on their Earth .. :) :) 
Falling in Love is the Secret Ambition .., 
Expressing it is the Biggest Hesitation .., 
Finding True Love is the Greatest Tension .., 
So Follow Indian Tradition 
and 
Marry Mom's Selection .. :p :D :D 
I think Its Naagavalli's Birthday today .. :p .. All her films Aapthamithra , Aaptharakshaka , Chandramukhi and Naagavalli all are Telecasted today in different Channels .. :) :) :p :D :D 
I Love my Shadow a lot .. Bcoz atleast it was with me When I am left alone by the One whom I actually Loved a lot .. :( :( 
Funny Truth .. 
" No one is as ugly as their Voter's id pic , nor as Good looking as their Facebook profile pic .. " .. :) :) 
Argument is Bad but Discussion is Good .. Why ??? 
Bcoz .. 
Argument is to find out " WHO " is Right 
But 
Discussion is to find out " WHAT " is Right .. :) :) 
Thank God .... At last finished Engineering with a good Percentage .... Got 77% ... :) :) 
A fake Smile can Hide billions of tears .. 
If Gandhiji would have ever thought about doing " ENGINEERING " , he would have definitely added a 4th monkey with hands on its Forehead .. :D :D 
Its only Imperfections that complains about what is imperfect .. The more Perfect we are , the more Gentle and Quite we become towards the Defects of others .. :) :) 
Express urself to someone who Cares for u .. 
Not to someone who Needs u .. 
Coz Care means Personal Commitment 
Need means Personal Requirement .. :) :) 
Just Survived from a Major Disaster in my Life .. Thank u God Thank u soooooo Much for saving me again and again .. :) :) 
Life is like a library owned by the author . 
In it are a few books which he wrote himself , 
but most of them were written for him .. :) :) 
Life is a cycle ... 
Wen u love , U get hurt .. 
Wen u get hurt , U hate ... 
Wen u hate , U try to forget ... 
Wen u try to forget , U start missing 
Wen u start Missing , U Start Loving ... :( :( 
Even if u Don't give any Gift to ur lover , Give more and more time to ur lover and be Sincere to ur lover .. I feel this is the only way to make ur love stronger and be happy in a Relationship .. How many of u agree with me ?????????????? 
Dil se Dhadkan bhulaaa denaa Aaaasaaan nahii hai .... :( :( </3 
I am neither Single nor Committed .. 
I am Reserve for the one who Deserve me .. :) :) 
Life must be understood Backwards ... 
but 
It must be Lived Forward ... :) :) 
I'll always need my mom no matter what age I am ...... My Mom has made me laugh ... wiped my tears ... hugged me tight ... watched me succeed ... seen me fall ... cheered me on ... kept me going strong ... and drove me a little crazy at times ! My Mom is a promise from God that I will have a friend forever ! Put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful mom ? :) 
I LOVE U MOM .... 
Unless you speak from Heart , U can't touch anyone's Heart .. :) :) 
Trust the one who can See these 3 things in You ... 
Sorrow behind your Smile ..., 
Love behind your Anger ......., 
Reason Behind your Silence .... :) :) 
Lead your Life similar to a Dictionary .. 
Providing Meaning to everyone Who refers you .. :) :) 
Care for the one Who Shares with you .. 
Share with the one Who knows you .. 
Know the one Who Miss you .. 
Never Miss the One Who remembers you Always .. :) :) 
Possessiveness is the Outcome of True Love .. 
Anger is the Outcome of Real Care .. 
So Accept these Both from your Loved one .. :) :) 
The Best Relationship is that in which 
Yesterday's Fight Does not stop Today's Communication .. :) :) 
UNMARRIED PERSON : 
" TajMahal Katbeku aadre Mumtaaz sikthaa illa .. :( .. " ...., 
MARRIED PERSON : 
" TajMahal Katbeku aadre 
Mumtaaz Saaythaa illa .. :( :( .. " .. :) :) :D :D 
Someday everything will make Perfect sense .. So for now , Laugh at the confusion , Smile through the tears , and keep reminding yourself that Everything happens for a reason !!!.. :) :) 
No one in this World is as busy as they say .. 
Their Ego makes them Feel busy and Find no time to Care for their Loved ones .. :) :) 
There is a Storm in my Heart but it rains From my Eyes .. :( :( 
You will Never really know what a " Lie " is ... 
Until , 
Ur most Loved and Trusted One Lies to u or hides Something from You .. :) :) 
LOVE is such a marvelous word .. 
If a girl understands , the boy won't understand it ..., 
If a boy understands , the girl won't understand it ..., 
If both understands , The World won't understand it ... :) :) 
3 hard Realities of Life .. 
You think a lot about the person u r trying to forget .. 
You Hurt a lot to the one you Love the most .. 
You Fight a lot with the one from whom you expect a lot .. :) :) 
" SORRY ... " doesn't always Fix everything ... :( :( 
Accepting many Wrong persons may not affect ur Life .. 
Rejecting one Right person will leave u broken throughout ur Life .. :) :) 
Avoiding Something doesn't always mean that you Hate it .. 
It could also mean that you want It , 
but 
You just know that It isn't yours ...!! :) :) 
The Greatest Gift u can Give to someone is ur time .. 
Because .., 
Its like giving a portion of ur Life that u can never get back .. :) :) 
" Nothing Happens without a Reason " ... 
Each Person who has crossed your Life has come Either to teach you Something or to Learn Something from you .. :) :) 
FORGIVENESS does not change the past , but it does make the future pleasant .. :) :) 
Don't go for looks ; they can deceive .. 
Don't go for wealth ; even that fades away .. 
Go for someone who makes you smile 
because 
it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright .. :) :) 
When 
nails are grown , 
we cut nails , not fingers ... 
Similarly , 
when 
our misunderstandings 
grows we should cut 
ego , not relations ... :) :) 
My Heart is in Relationship 
I am Single ... 
I will always need my Parents no matter what age I am ...... 
My parents have made me laugh ... wiped my tears ... hugged me tight ... watched me succeed ... saw me fall ... cheered me on ... kept me going strong ... scolded me ... motivated me ... restricted me ..... gave liberty .... 
Parents are a promise from God that I will have a friend forever ..!!!! 
I love my parents ........... Put this on your status if you hv World's Best Parents ... ??? :) 
i surely do ? them :) 
Tanha Dil ... Tanha Safar ... 
The Main Difference between Attitude and Ego is that Attitude makes you Different from others while Ego makes you Alone from others ... :) :) 
When someone Hurts you don't feel bad .. 
Coz 
Its the Law of nature that the tree that has sweetest fruits gets the Maximum number of Stones .. :) :) 
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all .. ( Lord Tennyson ) 
Don't trust the people who change their feelings with time ... Trust the people whose feelings remain the same when our time changes ..!! :) :)

There is one moment in your Life-When u r with someone n u feel like the world has stopped and ur life seems so perfect .. Make sure u never loose that person ... :) :) 
You never get a person of your type In this world .. You either have to adjust or to compromise .. You adjust , wen someone wants to be with you ... and compromise , wen you want to be with someone ... :) :)

The BEST Relationship is not the one which is free from problems and misunderstanding ... Its the one where one SORRY and a SMILE can make everything perfect as Before ... :) :) 
Be talented in front of everyone , but always be a fool in front of your dear ones ... that's always something special ... :) :) 
There is only a thread gap between Love and Friendship .... Stealing heart with permission is Friendship !!! Stealing heart without permission is Love !!! :) 
" The person who tries to keep everyone happy and always care for everyone is always the most lonely person ..... " 
Sometimes God upsets ur plans to setup his own plans .... And God's plans are always perfect .. So never get upset when ur plans get upset ... :) :)
