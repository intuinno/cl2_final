Marigolds smell like cat piss . 
I hate that new auto-tuned crap they call music which they play at all our school dances . Why is it so popular ? Kanye West , T-Pain , < PROPFIRST > Bieber , T.I. , and many other artists who fake having a good voice shouldn't deserve all of this attention just because they own a 100$ program which is able to automatically tune their voice . Thumbs up if you agree . 
I hate being short . Maybe if I drink Miracle Grow I can be taller ? 
Why can't British people pronounce the ' T ' in ' British' ? 
Buying a new laptop ... A netbook . Cause if I keep doing this ... Well it's a waste of time , my mom's not cooperating ...

Life would be a lot easier if people did more than complain and sulk about everything . 
The Devil Wears Prada has the . Best . Song . Names . Evar . 
WHY DO MY FRIENDS KEEP SAYING \SHIZZNIT \"??!" 
Epic . It's Raining ... I LOVE THUNDER !!! AND RAIN !!!! I'M GOING RUN AROUND IN THE RAIN !!!! YAYYY !!!! :D

Song Mood : On To The Next One - Escape The Fate 
Song Mood : The Flood - Escape The Fate 
What I love about Escape The Fate ... All of their songs are the same amount of awesomeness , even though they have switched lead singers AND guitarists . 
Sometimes I wish I could change the things I've done . That's when I go back and realize ... I can't , can I ? 
It's just amazing ... Just amazing how quickly life can change ... 
What song shall I learn to play on guitar ? Comment it ^^ 
What's really annoying is being forced to remember things you want to forget .

Do I need to die to show you what I mean ? I'm living my life always ready to scream . I hate myself for loving you . I'm no good for you anyway .
