Happy New Year ! 

sleep and I aren't friends for some reason . My solution : watching Lost . 
definitely just became a fan of Adventure Now , and you should , too . 
wishes < PROPMALE > Bartlett was a real President . 
got the IB Diploma ! 
Microsoft makes a search engine and Google makes an operating system . Huh . 
is currently working on writing . 
my writing now on the internet : http://theophilusian.wordpress.com/ 
Coffeehouse Theology ; Kairos . 
kairos was great , uploaded new story ( theophilusian.wordpress.com ); good day . 
is working on a story . 
uploaded the conclusion to \The < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Conspiracy\ " ( theophilusian.wordpress.com) ! " 
the second segment makes me proud to be a tennessean : http://www.hulu.com/watch/83170/the-colbert-report-wed-jul-15-2009 ... but not really . 
wants the Sears Tower's name to be changed back to normal . 
will be in Chicago for a week ! 
just got back from the BEST mission trip to Chicago ! 
read the Book of Zephaniah and thinks it is still profoundly relevant to us today . 
has written two new things in two days ! http://tinyurl.com/howshallilive and http://tinyurl.com/howfarpost 
Coffeehouse Theology/Kairos tonight !! 
was going to find out his roommate tonight , but a technical error decided he has to wait until tomorrow . :P 
has been assigned a room ( not excited about the fourth floor though ) and a roommate , and has uploaded some new writing : http://theophilusian.wordpress.com/2009/07/29/keep-yourselves-from-idols/

Coffeehouse Theology/Kairos night ! 
< PROPFIRST > Sorkin is a brilliant writer and producer , just saying . :) 
wants to write but needs ideas ... 
didn't know the Switchfoot song \Sooner or Later\ " was based on Soren Kierkegaard . The lyrics are more meaningful now . :) " 
Stars : http://theophilusian.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/stars/ It feels good to right again . :) 
When peace , like a river , attendeth my way , When sorrows like sea billows roll ; Whatever my lot , Thou has taught me to say , It is well , it is well , with my soul . 
can't import his Beautiful Letdown CD onto his iPhone because it's in DualDisc format ... horrah for failed media endeavors . 
\That's the problem with the American Dream : makes everyone concerned for the day they're going to be rich . \"" 
tomorrow's my last full day in < PROPMALE > for a long time . Whoa . 
is registered for the Freshman retreat next weekend ! 
loves Samford University ! 
RUF was the BEST way to end my first day at SU ! 
was served an abundant serving of humility today . 
one book of the Iliad down , three to go . 
got to go to the RUF cookout , now for reviewing the Iliad . Metress at 8:00 AM . Not to excited about the 8:00 AM part . 
“Sometimes I ask myself if the rain and the storms come from God or if they just happen , and then I think that this same rain that floods our streets makes my crops grow and feeds the hungry , and no one but God can be behind that . Those days I’m thankful for the rain . Yes , I thank God for the rain . ” 
“What a farce is this modern liberality ! Freedom of speech means practically , that we must only talk about unimportant things . We must not talk about religion , we must not talk about death , we must not talk about birth . Something must break this strange indifference , this strange dreamy egoism , this strange loneliness of millions in a crowd . Something must break it . Why should it not be you and I ? ” -GK Chesterton 
anyone need a ride to < PROPFEMALE > Hills for church tomorrow ? I'm going to the 11 o'clock and college mixer lunch . 
I sadly cannot help but write like what I read sometimes . When I read < PROPMALE > , my fiction comes out in lines . ( frustrating ! ) When I read Aristotle , my prose comes out verbosely and convoluted . ( equally frustrating , but sounds cool ) 
“I will say more : even—yes , even if this never comes to pass , even if there never is a heaven on earth , even then I shall go on preaching . And really how simple it all is : in one day , in one hour , everything could be arranged at once ! If only we all wanted it , everything could be arranged immediately . ” –Dostoevsky , Dream of a Ridiculous Man 
isn't finished with the Iliad because Dr. Metress sent us homework on a Saturday of a three-day weekend . I voice my disapproval , but I will do it anyway ... 
watching the Brentwood Baptist service from this morning . 
uploaded a new story : http://theophilusian.wordpress.com/ 
Go Bulldogs ! 
has the fight song stuck in his head . Church tomorrow ! ... err , today actually . 
is possibly confused , but might not be confused seeing as he could be confused about being confused , which is quite confusing . 
enjoyed the four Fiddes lectures very much ! 
is soaked . it rains so much here . 
feels like he would be just fine if he didn't see Aristotle again for quite a while . 
thinks the Castle premiere was brilliantly written and acted . Yay ! 
if you read Books 3-4 of Plato's Republic on drugs , it would look like the ending of Book 10 of Plato's Republic . 
has developed the idea for a < PROPFEMALE > and is quite excited about it . 
finished reading for tomorrow , watched Castle , and now can read what I want to read . :) 
one citation away from finishing that paper ... if only the Iliad didn't have so many pages ... 
is done and can sleep now . 
outlined his writing and rhetoric paper and can now go to RUF and then spend the night reading about Suffering and Ethics . That doesn't sound as fun written out as it does in my head . 
watching Back to the Future with awesome people was an awesome way to end the day ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Cousins is the pope 
is watching 30 Rock and < PROPMALE > Baldwin quoted Eliot's \The Hollow Men . \ " Made my day . " 
just saw the most obvious and awesome Firefly reference on television ever ! Thank you ABC's Castle . 
“Beginning with < PROPMALE > , all the great Hebrew prophets challenged the simple identification between God and the nation , or the naïve confidence of the nation in its exclusive relation to God . The prophets prophesied in the name of a holy God who spoke judgment upon the nation [ that claimed that it ] and God were one or that God was the exclusive possession of the nation . ” -Reinhold Niebuhr 
thinks you should look at < PROPFIRST > Carr's status . 
is watching < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > \get down with the sickness\ " in the fellows room haha " 
is watching his paper come together quite slowly ... too bad it's due tomorrow . :/ 
White is not a mere absence of color ; it is a shining and affirmative thing . Also , Virtue is not the absence of vices or the avoidance of moral dangers ; virtue is a vivid and separate thing . Mercy does not mean not being cruel , or sparing people revenge or punishment ; it means a plain and positive thing . In a word , God paints in many colors ; but he never paints so gorgeously as when he paints in white . -GK Chesterton 
finally ... finished ... with ... that ... WIT paper ... 
One of the personalized facebook ads on my profile was for \Affordable Drug Rehab\ " ... " 
hasn't really gotten done any of the work he planned to get done . Oh well , it was a nice break with family and friends . 
wants to get this work done .... 
\I’m sorry if you disagree with me . I don’t write the laws . I just distribute them when they are dropped off on my doorstep by a pure white dove named < PROPMALE > who works for the Southern Baptist Convention . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Acuff " 
this is how I have felt about my to-do list for today : http://xkcd.com/349/ 
5 Pages to go ... 
it's still Wendesday as far as I'm concerned . 
it snowed in Birmingham ! 
wants to go back to < PROPMALE > where there are no tsunamis or final exams . 
2 exams and 1 essay . 
is \as gangsta as a pocket watch . \ " ( http://stuffchristianslike.net/2009/12/1642/ ) " 
two finals ... then home . 
needs his Samford friends to add him on skype : wes_spears 
my laptop battery is now officially useless . :/ 
watching the Glass Menagerie ( one of the best plays ever , by the way ) . 
Celebration of Discipline by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is fantastic ! I wish I'd read it a long time ago . 
Avatar was epic ! Definitely worth seeing in 3D . 
wanted to say something profound about Christmas , but I think < PROPFIRST > Carr's got it covered . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
I understand Borders not having Boethius , but Saint < PROPFIRST > ? Very disappointing . 
Leaving for Samford tomorrow ... leaving for Rome on Wednesday ! 
Who's at Samford and wants to go get dinner someplace ? 
has a blog http://theophilusian.wordpress.com and now so does < PROPFIRST > Carr http://churchofthemalcontent.wordpress.com and you should read them both . :) 
\I'll only believe in the Myth of Er if I get to come back as Wolverine . \ " - < PROPFIRST > " 
got his convocation credit email --- wait , nope . Still the same amount as when I left . Funny how that works . :) 
back to Tennessee today , missing all my Samford friends . It was great to see all you guys ! 
According to Barna’s polling data acquired by a random sampling of churches around the country : 57% of American churches continue to use the traditional Times < PROPMALE > typeface , while 23% have succumbed to Papyrus , 15% have abandoned written language altogether and only communicate with YouTube videos , and the remaining 5% use Old English font because “that’s what < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > used . ” sacredsandwich.com/archives/5749 
HTML-5 must be adopted by hulu for video playback instead of Flash . Then I could watch it on my phone . :)

http://stuffchristianslike.net/2010/02/hope/ 
is somewhat perturbed . 
is sermon writing for St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day . 
\Today is about love because today is simply today . \ " http://theophilusian.wordpress.com/2010/02/14/no-greater-love/ " 
had the most awesome car ride ever in the morning with < PROPMALE > Halbrooks , < PROPFIRST > Carr , and < PROPMALE > D . House ; a great dinner with my family ; and a movie with the Fellows to round out the day . Aside from getting chewed out by Campus Safety for being in < PROPMALE > 90 seconds too long , a pretty awesome day ! 
< PROPFIRST > Carr and < PROPFIRST > Wood are meddling meddlers . 
Meals , movies , winks , questions , and Yogurt Mountain with friends today was fantastic -- a perfect Saturday . You guys are great ! 
most certainly does not think < PROPFIRST > Beck is a genius , no matter what @ < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > types on his computer . 
will be gone tomorrow from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm for Samford Sunday and is just realizing how long a time that is . Huh . 
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy crib ? 
thinks everyone should come to the Socratic Event in < PROPMALE>'s this evening at 7 PM ! 
needed Spring Break yesterday . 
had a great time with < PROPFIRST > Gerrish , Kolin Rubel , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Szymanski , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Smith , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > at the Dr. Bains \beau tie\ " tutorial . Truly a bonding experience for the ages . " 
plans to spend the evening writing . Perhaps something will come of it , perhaps not . Such is the process . 
listened to podcasts , cleaned out his Samford email , and read books today . You bet I'm an exciting individual . 
Ever wonder what the church will look like in the future ? http://wp.me/pzOSl-3u 
30 Rock is awesome . 
visiting the Church at Station Hill tomorrow and then back to Samford ! 
loves Samford . 
service in the morning , geocaching in the afternoon , and a movie in the evening . Good day , indeed !

My first year of college went by fast . Thanks all of you for making it great !

\Christian faith has nothing to fear from the power of thought . \ " -Church Historian < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > discussing St. < PROPFIRST > " 
Rereading Plato's Republic and I'm seeing striking similarities between the Greek and a certain sixteenth century Italian political theorist . Today , I mean to pay a compliment to neither ... 
has restored the power of the internet to his home . 
has figured out a way to watch the episode of Lost he missed tonight now : it's free , legal , and involves a time machine ( but not polar bears ) . 
The Empire Strikes Back came out 30 years ago today ... happy birthday ! I am , in fact , a nerd , it's true . :) 
\It is useless to play off orthopraxis against orthodoxy . . . revelation is not isolated from life or artificially juxtaposed to it . It is concerned with the ultimate meaning of life and it illumines the whole of life with the light of the Gospel . . . \ " -Pope < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > II " 
I think the LOST finale may still be an hour long just with an hour of commercial breaks . 
LOST ... it's over . 
LOST finale . Did you love it or hate it ? 
wrote about 17 pages today in one sitting on a new story ... feels good . 
Coffeehouse Theology tomorrow . :) 
At the end of Coffeehouse Theology today , one of the employees came up to us and thanked us for sharing the word of God . I do love what I do . 
showing Toy Story 2 for the kids in the children's ministry at church . I'd forgotten how many < PROPFEMALE > Wars references there are at the beginning of this movie . haha 
Coffeehouse Theology tonight -- we're talking about < PROPFEMALE > and the Pentateuch . 
loves the discussions we have at Coffeehouse Theology . :) 
More great theological and ecclesial discussions tonight , even if they take place over considerable distance . I am thankful and God is good in providing good friends . :) 
\Prayer is a form of protest with God against reality . \"" 
\You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and it is they that testify on my behalf . Yet you refuse to come to me to have life . \ " < PROPFIRST > 5:39 -40 ( NRSV ) Understanding the difference between Word and word . " 
\Baptism has been superseded by the evangelical invitation . Preaching is being displaced by other media . The Supper is so infrequently observed that Christians starve for lack of nourishment . We reject all attempts to make the church and its practices incidental to our relationship with Christ and one another . \ " -Baptist Manifesto " 
wants a book that's down in Birmingham . How I miss the Samford library ... 
has found multiple Baptist Churches in Birmingham with liturgy . Where have they been all my life ? 
\Faith is but a name for learning how to go on without knowing the answers . \ " - < PROPMALE > Hauerwas on Christianity and Suffering " 
< PROPMALE > Hauerwas ' memoir is one of the best books I've ever read . 
really doesn't want to wait an hour for my phone to update to iOS4 because it does just about nothing for my phone ... 
Kairos at Brentwood Baptist lived up to it's namesake tonight . 
thought camp with the Brentwood Baptist youth was amazing , challenging , provoking , awesome , fun , revealing , and just plain great ! Remember to live Romans 12:1 -21 kind of lives , small group members . :) 
\Theology is doxology . \ " - < PROPFIRST > S . Fiddes " 
loves to talk with friends in ministry , which is on reason why < PROPFEMALE > Szymanski is awesome . :) 
The Oregon Trail on sale in App Store this weekend . Yes . Oh memories . 
can't update his Adobe Reader or anything because he doesn't have permission to access his own Common Files folder . I apparently have to ask the SYSTEM , which I also own ... 
< PROPFEMALE > . España . 
\No one nation can hold the entirety of the Kingdom of God . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
Just sent out the notes for Coffeehouse Theology tomorrow . Remember to read your Gospel of choice , those of you attending ! Excited < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > will be joining us . :) 
just sent in my last premin internship journal for the summer . It's coming to a close soon , isn't it ? 
\The Christian alternative to war is worship . \ " -S . Hauerwas " 
Updated my phone today . Good news ! It worked ! The reception bars are indeed taller . What ? No , of course it doesn't do anything else like make it go as fast as it used to . That would be absurd . 
\The only ultimate disaster that can befall us [ as Christians ] is to feel ourselves to be at home here on earth . As long as we are aliens we cannot forget our true homeland which is that other kingdom You promised . \ " - < PROPMALE > Muggeridge " 
Watching the Rugrats tell the story of < PROPMALE > . Good times . 
in Chicago 17-24th . Pray for the youth , that God might work through them this week to the < PROPFEMALE > of his name . Peace be with you . 
< PROPMALE > Poole is my hero . 
All you BBC/SH students who went on the Chicago trip : you are incredible . Out of the five times I've worked in that city , the work you guys did was some of the most inspiring Kingdom-building I've seen . I'll miss you guys . Peace be with you and God bless . 
The church becomes the Church when it begins living like Armitage Baptist Church - < PROPMALE > . To live life as a Church not driven by programming or < PROPFIRST > but lives lived in the belief in and light of the life , death , and resurrection of Jesus Christ is truly an shining example of what He meant when He spoke of the Kingdom . 
so ... in case you hadn't head , Joss Whedon is directing the Avengers movie in 2012 . I'm not usually excited about these movies , but now I am . 
officially will be in Birmingham Friday through Sunday . Hurray ! 
taking a break from the curriculum and discussing the Sermon on the Mount tonight at Coffeehouse Theology . 
was stopped for a second today in grateful appreciation of the aesthetic of the Bible he received in the mail today . We don't make Bibles like this anymore ... and then I discovered the bubble wrap it came in . 
We’re not pacifists because we want to abolish war , but to be faithful followers of Jesus Christ . - < PROPMALE > Hauerwas 
It's time for Kairos . That statement is somewhat redundant . If you know why , you get 5 Greek points . 
Someone forgot to log out of his facebook < PROPFEMALE > , but he has the best Mom in the world who did it before his brother got to it ! : ) 
\You see then it is by action and not by faith alone that a man is justified . \ " - St. James\ 
In Birmingham . Yes , it's quite awesome . 
had a phenomenal weekend in Birmingham ! I can't wait to be back there again , but I'm also looking forward to discussing the Apostle < PROPFIRST > at Coffeehouse Theology tomorrow . :) It shall be a good last few weeks . 
so ... the Reformed Theological Society called my phone today . :P 
is tired of seeing political ads on television that only support hate and reinforce prejudice . Sometimes , I'm pretty much ashamed to live here . 
< PROPFIRST > Tillich's sermon \You Are Accepted\ " was one of the best things I've ever read . " 
So , school is starting up for everyone but me ; however , it makes me want to start school , too . How things change . 
My dog enjoys sleeping in the sun so much , it makes me think she survives via photosynthesis . 
is going to see The Other Guys with < PROPMALE > Spears . I have pretty good expectations , hopefully it will live up to them ! 
would like to sit in the Fellows room and have in-depth theological discussions tomorrow . I don't see this happening for a few reasons . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s beard is gone . 
haha :\ 
\// We exist to bear witness//we had to be//the infinite needs us to see it . //Without the perceiver//the perceived does not exist . //That gives us leverage . Don't look until you get what you want . \ " \ 
14 more days . 
\We live in a time that celebrates church-less Christianity . But Jesus never taught that following Him was a solo experience . Even the Lone Ranger had Tonto . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
< PROPFIRST > Carr , please report to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s most recent status . There is a papal dispute in progress . 
\It was grace-full preaching . I even pounded the pulpit . Twice . Many pulpits have been pounded in the name of hellfire ; I thought it was time to pound one in the name of grace . \"" 
12 days ... 
And , alas , Coffeehouse Theology has come to a close . 
book sale at the library today ! 
The book sale went well ! An old Bible , some Brennan Manning , < PROPFIRST > a Kempis , that kind of thing . :) 
\Yet I’ve come to believe in a form of Christianity that is at least as \ 
Who've thought highs in the 80s would feel cool ? 
just realized how much I need to do before the semester starts ... and to think , I've been bored . 
It's amusing to me when fundamentalists attempt to describe postmodernism . 
Church Music by < PROPFIRST > Crowder Band is possibly my favorite worship music album . 
Well , that was terrifying . My computer shut off and wouldn't turn back on . Took it to Best Buy and found out it was the power cord and not the computer . Phew . Needless to say , now the rest of my files are safely backed up . 
watching < PROPMALE > Armey on the Daily Show . I like how people rewrite history to make their point . 
So I misplaced my phone this evening and just found it . Fancy that this one period of time , unlike the rest of the week , is when I get a lot of texts and emails . Sorry to those of you to whom I did not respond promptly . 
A conversation with < PROPFIRST > Carr : \ 
< PROPFIRST > : BBC college ministry is doing CoD every other Wednesday\ 
Wes : Call of Duty ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : Yes . Bonhoeffer coded the first Call of Duty . \ 
Wes : sweet ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > : You get to blow up Hitler 
3 days ! 
\And now we've come to the sun's hour of rest\ 
Netflix on my phone ? Yes . 
what a crazy random happenstance . 
Finish packing tomorrow and then off to Birmingham . 
“Because it is often easier conclusively to prove natural and \ 
philosophical propositions than interpretations of specific biblical \

\This guy's on secular radio and television 
Saw family , got my books , saw my friends , got to see needtobreathe . Good day in my books . 
The extreme nationalisms of our century are laboratories for the study of what ultimate concern means in all aspects of human existence ... everything is centered in the only god , the nation - a god who certainly proves to be a demon , but who shows clearly the unconditional character of an ultimate concern . -Tillich 
< PROPFIRST > Tillich and I are going to < PROPFEMALE > out in the dorm this evening unless anyone else wants to do something . :) 
Fellows ! We're getting together to watch < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and our Bulldogs in my room ( < PROPMALE > Hall ) , come on over ! We have food , it'll be fun . :) Kick-off is at 11 , so if I need to check you in , come by around 10:30 or so . 
spent the first part of the day watching football with some great friends . Now I'm working on the Bible Study curriculum for next week in the Fellows Room if anyone wants to < PROPFEMALE > out . :) More Lord of the Rings tonight , Fellows ! Looking forward to it . 
Going to celebrate at St. < PROPMALE>'s Episcopal Church at 10:30 . If you'd like to come , let me know . :) 
would side with Erasmus over < PROPMALE > any day of the week . 
Nerf Gun War in < PROPMALE > tonight . 6-9 PM . Be there . :) 
\[The Gospel of < PROPFIRST > is ] telling the story of friendship loose in the world . \ " - Dr. < PROPFIRST > O'Day " 
Dinner with Dr. < PROPFIRST > O'Day , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , Bishop < PROPFIRST > Willimon , Dr. < PROPMALE > Barnette , Dr. Roxburgh , < PROPFEMALE > Szymanski , < PROPFEMALE > Coyle , < PROPMALE > Havard , and < PROPFIRST > Carr . Can an evening be more awesome ? Bible study was icing on the cake . I love Samford . 
\Blessed are the peacemakers 
had a fun game night with < PROPFIRST > Carr , < PROPFEMALE > Longoria , Carlson Hayes , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
\It's not done ! It's gestating in the womb of my mind ! \ " - < PROPFIRST > Carr " 
needs a running < PROPMALE > ? I'm thinking Thursdays/Saturdays ... anyone interested ? 
Oh Monday , I'm glad I don't have to be in class at 8 when you come around anymore . This would not be possible . 
Go Bulldogs ! Great game . Bible Study afterward went well . Now time for sleep . 
Racketball . Nerf War . < PROPMALE > Python . Good day .

only Greek and Feynman to go ... 
Sermon on the Mount Bible Study tonight at 9 . < PROPMALE > 105 ! 
It was fun to meet all of your families tonight , fellow Fellows ! 
Did you know that cebu are real ?! A boy COULD have a sick cebu , a sad cebu , and a mute cebu . 
Why was I not told the story about Sir < PROPFIRST > Gates and the ship \Sea Venture\ " in early U.S. colonial history ? It's like a real-life Lost . " 
Lots to do this week ... 
Good discussion at Bible Study tonight ! I'm looking forward to next week . 
Nerf war at 3 . 
today was officially one of my worst days ever . But dinner with awesome people ( < PROPFIRST > Carr , < PROPFEMALE > Longoria , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Altendorf , etc . ( too many tags )) and running with Carlson Hayes was much better than this morning . 
Samford students , feeling opinionated ? Send me 250 words by tomorrow morning and you could be in the Crimson on Wednesday ! 
is heading to North < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow ! Seminary road trip with < PROPFIRST > Carr and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! I'm super exited ! 
En route to North < PROPFEMALE > ! Just stopped for dinner in < PROPFEMALE > . 
It's been a good few days in Winston-Salem . Off to Durham to hear N . T . Wright at Duke tomorrow morning ! 
Worship in Duke Chapel was incredible . N . T . Wright was amazing . Got to go by < PROPMALE > Hauerwas's legendary door . Fantastic day already . 
had a phenomenal fall break road trip to North < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Carr . Visited Wake < PROPMALE > and Duke Divinity Schools . Incredible experience ! Much fun was had . 
Philosophy paper , Greek homework , Scientific Inquiry midterm , Christology reading . Go . 
ugh ... finished with a fall break's worth of homework . Not the most enjoyable night of my life . Time for sleep . 
lots of television comedies in the afternoon in the dorm , the Ides of Pizza in the evening , and Waffle House at night . All with pretty awesome people . It made for a good Friday night . 
Preview Day and Samford v . Furman . Let's go Bulldogs ! 
It's that time of the week again . I need a 250 word student opinion for the newspaper . Any takers ? :) 
It's still Sunday and I already know Monday is going to be awful ...

\Give us days to be filled with small rebellions\

We're about halfway back to Samford ! 
will spend the remainder of the night reading < PROPFIRST > Barth and studying ancient Greek . It's quite an exciting Halloween ! 
Samford , \ 
I don't need the wireless Internet to be fast . I just need it to work . I can't do my job if the only way I can access the Internet is through my phone on AT&T's network . Fix it . Thanks . \ 
< PROPMALE > 
Bible Study tonight in < PROPMALE > 105 @ 9 . Prayer and fasting are the subject . 
Samford , \ 
My AT&T cellular network loaded a video faster than the wireless in my dorm . \ 
Just thought you should know . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Wars in the Fellows room at 9:30 ! 
Going to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters .

My WIT paper is proving to be an elusive foe . As is productivity . Dr. < PROPMALE > Needleman's lecture troubled me on many levels , though I understand his point . Why do we have to think about these things so much when we have work to do ? 
I found part of his Western Intellectual Tradition paper in the bowels of my mind . Plato was right , after all , it was already there . How nice . 
so much work ...... 
paper day ... 
\What are kingdoms but great robberies ? \ " - St. < PROPFIRST > " 
is in the home stretch . 
The WIT paper has been vanquished . Only proofreading remains . 
Just watched Castle from two weeks ago . So good . 
Does it get old , getting emails in your inbox from one of your favorite writers/theologians ? Nope . 
so ... many ... Greek ... verbs ... 
I'm at home . The house is cold and quiet . It's very nice . 
so full ... 
\He shall judge between the\ 
\Stupid chaos butterflies . \"" 
Getting ready to go back to Birmingham 
Phenomenal service at convo today ! 
The smoke detector decided it wants a new battery . It decided as much at 11:30 at night . I'm not a fan . 
\The hidden wound of our democracy is that we are dealing death all over the world . But < PROPMALE > reminds us of a different < PROPMALE > ... and < PROPMALE>'s Gospel shows him to us . \ " -J . Wilson-Hartgrove " 
If you haven't looked into attending A Night of Peace yet , you should . We'll be having a night-long service of fasting with prayers for leaders , soldiers , and nations as well as preaching from some of us and singing Christmas songs about peace . I hope you can come ! Bring a blanket and a friend ! Peace be with you . 
So much to do .... 
I hate Mondays ... 
anyone want to go out to eat ? 
Good times at Chilis with < PROPFIRST > Carr , < PROPFEMALE > Miller , < PROPFIRST > Altendorf , and Zach Brown & co . Only four more days . 
One down , three to go . 
Samford people , my friend Ryne Ledbetter ' s status : Look at your status , now look at mine , now back to yours , now back to mine . Sadly , yours isnt mine . But if you stop posting about other things and make this your status , yours could be like mine . Look down , back up . Where are you ? You're on Facebook , reading the status your status could be like . I'm on a computer . 
Who's still up working on writing papers ? This guy . And this guy --> < PROPFIRST > Carr 
\I prefer the homely joys to that of making academic history . \ " -Henlee Barnette " 
About to take Greek , then only one more to go ! 
Greek wasn't bad at all . :) One more to go . 
WIT and packing tomorrow . 
Why is it that the more really old high church things I prefer the more liberal people think I am ? It's confusing . 
Candlelight service , Sonic , Cookies , Christmas Lights , A Christmas Story . It's Christmas < PROPFEMALE > . 
Snow :) 
I love books . 
A lot of \Christian art\ " is about the lens\ 
Comments on AL.com are just deplorable ... 
Ordered a European Charger for my Kindle and received a USB cord for a computer ... 
So ... birds are falling from the sky and hundreds of thousands of fish are dead in Arkansas . Think what you will . 
I'm leaving for Italy tomorrow ? Whoa . 
Getting ready to board in Atlanta ! 
hectic in Frankfurt but we made it . 
was on top of the vatican today . i thought youd like to know . 
It was an interesting journey but we made it to Canarra , a village outside of Assisi where we're staying at a nice little bed and breakfast . Good times . 
Went to Assii today , and it was incredible . A vibrant place spiritually , lots of thoughts . The views from the top were also awe-inspiring . An amazing day . Hanging out in Canarra tomorrow and then off to < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Watching < PROPMALE > Texas Ranger dubbed in Italian in Cannara , Umbria . Enough said . 
Heading home tomorrow . Looking forward to being in Birmingham again but not that 3:15 wake up call . See you soon , Samford . 
In Frankfurt again . One more flight . Almost there . 
on they way to Samford 
Anyone want to go to lunch at noon ? 
Social Network at the dollar theatre at 7:35 showing anyone ? Text me . 
Anyone have a copy of the < PROPMALE > Appreciation book I could borrow for the semester ? 
\I'm going to hack some more . \ " -Walle " 
Freshmen Fellows , whoever wants to meet for the BP Group , we'll be in < PROPMALE>'s at 11:45 ! 
Recovered my keys , watching < PROPFEMALE > Bride in the Fellows room . Good times . 
Reading Opinion Sections for WIT . I think one of them said something borderline racist . Fun . 
\I haven't come for only you // but for my people to pursue . // And you cannot care for me with no regard for her . // If you love me you will love the Church . \ " - < PROPMALE > Webb " 
would like to avoid any ... imperial entanglements . 
hiybbprqag 
We'll be watching the Super Bowl in the Fellows Room ( thanks to some technological wizardry ) this evening if you'd like to come ! There will be food . 
Kickoff is at 6 ! Free food and the game on the projector in the Fellows room . Be there ! 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Latham , \ 
I know I didn't really ice up the roadways too bad . I know I didn't come with the force of a Midwestern blizzard . But I covered the campus and it looks really nice . So , why don't you just let all those nice students out of class tomorrow morning to enjoy me or sleep in a little . It sure would be nice . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
The Snow 
Step Sing . Was . Awesome . Great job everyone ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , everyone . It was a great day ! 
Watching Serenity with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Walle , and < PROPFIRST > . Good night . :) 
Phenomenal day . 
Apparently someone searched ( and found ) my blog based on the following search term today : \theophilusian fragments < PROPMALE > spears is mcjesus i love you so much . \ " ... ? McJesus ? What does that even mean ? " 
No warm water in < PROPMALE > ? Not the best start ever . 
We see the Church of today in no sure position , wavering between yes and no , even more in ethics than dogmatics ; now silent where it ought to speak , now speaking where it ought to be silent ; always behind what the world has done without it ; full of goodwill on all sides ; but certainly it raises no prophetic voice , no watchman's cry , above the confusion of other voices . - < PROPFIRST > Barth 
\You should grow a beard . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Janas to < PROPMALE > Brandl in Ethics Bowl " 
I simply don't have the passion to be a Greek scholar . That's all there is to it . 
I'm loving that community of 25 freshman Fellows all together . Does the heart good . :) Even if it's just because they're studying . 
So ... EBSCO cut off my access to the book I'm writing my book review on ? Really ? Sure , I guess I was done with that . 
Speech in Praise of < PROPMALE > 
\It was me . In the Fellows Room . With my hands . \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > playing Clue " 
Fringe is SO good . 
I realized I have 3 midterms next Thursday . Fun . 
\ ... the short-lived Jawa culture remains an enigmatic phenomenon . \ " according to my archaeology book . I think they were short-lived because they kept stealing droids . I'll ask Dr. Strange tomorrow . " 
Leaving for Ethics Bowl National Competition tomorrow . Be back Friday evening . 
Castle is so good !! 
We're in Cincinnati ... working on cases for last minute prep . Big day tomorrow . :) 
A certain individual on the ethics bowl trip just acknowledged himself as a hipster . I'll let you guess who . 
Lost both so far by very small differentials . Disappointing but we're performing well . 
Back to Birmingham ! :) 
It's good to be back . 
Anyone with a printer willing to print my sermon out for me for tomorrow ? 
Bad News : I'm really hungry for some reason but don't have any food in the dorm . Good News : I'm preaching tomorrow . And it's not too far away . Yay for Cullman ! 
\Give 100% . Giving 110% is impossible . Only idiots recommend that . \ " -The < PROPMALE > Swanson Pyramid of Greatness " 
Almighty God , you have created us out of the dust of the earth : < PROPMALE > that these ashes may be to us a sign of our mortality and penitence , that we may remember that it is only by your gracious gift that we are given everlasting life ; through Jesus Christ our Savior . Amen . 
Packed a bag full a books , a bag full of clothes , and an iPod loaded with lectures . I'm ready to drive home . 
My copy of Barth's \Church and State\ " only quotes the Institutes in Latin . Slightly problematic . Thank goodness for footnotes and a nearby English translation . " 
Sometimes I want a Bible printed on actual paper . I don't care how thick it is or how many volumes you have to separate it into . I just want to write on it when I don't have a super fine lead pencil . 
Currently 1/4 of the way through < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s book . Expect an in-depth review on my blog soon . 
Someone found my blog on google today via \what does a baptist church look like . \ " I like it . " 
Halfway done with \Love Wins . \ " I'll do a post on Heaven & Hell today and cover the rest of the book tomorrow . Heavy stuff . " 
What's going on Louisville ? 
Lost all his contacts today , more or less . Anyone from after high school . Joy . Getting a new phone tomorrow anyway ... so , oh well . 
Go Belmont ! 
New phone . Same number . Text me your name so I can add you back to my contacts . :) 
Finally finished with all these varied applications . 
The Crimson comes out on Friday this week , so if you'd like to submit a short 250 words of your own opinion for the paper , feel free to send me one . :) 
Go ResLife , you scheduled me to sign up for housing during my Craft midterm . 
We're going to Chili's tonight to watch UNC-Marquette and Kansas-Richmond ( starts 6:15 ) . We're meeting in the Fellows Room at 5:30 , leaving at 5:45 . Text me if you want to come . 
Loves the West Wing . I'm not terribly political , but I have a weakness for great writing . 
You know , I didn't get all the studying done I wanted to , but today was pretty awesome . < PROPFEMALE > Little , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Walling , < PROPFIRST > Elmore , < PROPFEMALE > Norville , < PROPFIRST > Dorrill , < PROPFIRST > Goebel , < PROPMALE > Brandl , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and everybody else , including random guy who threw the frisbee with us on the quad . 
\[William ] < PROPFIRST > claimed that it was only when he was under the influence of nitrous oxide that he was able to understand Hegel . \ " -Wikipedia " 
Free cloud storage with any Amazon account . Sweet . 
The game is the symbol of all hopelessness , and I just lost it . < PROPFEMALE > Snider 
In case you didn't know , < PROPFIRST > Colbert will be on < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow singing < PROPFEMALE > Black's \Friday . \ " Just so you know . :P " 
Go look at hulu.com . Now . It's awesome . 
Samford Gives Back folks , remember you need to be at Seibert for breakfast at 8:00 am to get convo . See you tomorrow ! 
Seibert gymnasium at 8 for Samford gives back . If you have any questions , text me . Sign your name to it though because I lost most of your < PROPFIRST > when I switched phones . 
Thanks Fellows who showed for Samford Gives Back today ( those in our official group and all the others ! ) . Good job everyone ! 
If you want to come watch the Butler-VCU game with us , come to the Fellows room at 4:40 with $5 and we're going to go get a lot of food at Chili's and watch the game . :D 
Change of plans . We're doing the $5 each thing , but with pizza in the Fellows Room . We'll order around half time , come on over ! 
Great day of eager service , basketball games , good food , and great friends . Well done . 
The Waves : I'm not quite sure it was worth the journey . 
Such a good retreat . Great discussions and , more importantly , great food . Now I'm rested and refreshed . 
I had a great time preaching in Gadsden today . Looking forward to the week ahead . 
I love my life and that people like < PROPFEMALE > Little , < PROPFIRST > Goebel , < PROPFEMALE > Kawell , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Smith , and < PROPFIRST > Dorrill are in it . You guys are my favorites . Sorry rest of the world , but you weren't quite as awesome as they were today . :) 
I wish conversations in real life were timed as perfectly as they are in the West Wing . 
Easter Egg Hunt = Epic Fail . 
If you want to come to a Good Friday service , let me know . Brookwood's is at 12:00 . 
Anyone know why there were four police cars and campus safety trucks around Smith last night ? 
“In the face of a man’s death , a Christian never rejoices , but reflects on the serious responsibilities of each person before God and before men , and hopes and works so that every event may be the occasion for the further growth of peace and not of hatred . ” -Vatican's Response 
Prayer service for our brothers and sisters affected by the tornadoes during convocation hour today . In < PROPMALE > ; no credit offered .
