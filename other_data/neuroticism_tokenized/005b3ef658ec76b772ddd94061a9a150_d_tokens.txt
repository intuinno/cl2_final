is just holding Baby PJ and is waiting for dinner to be started 

Congratulations to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > on the adoption of their new son ! 
I spent my first night on a BiPAP machine last night and woke up feeling pretty rested . For those of you out there with sleep apnea , get an evaluation ... it is wonderful to feel rested again ! 
Today I learned of the passing of one of my favorite persons , < PROPFEMALE > Klobas . She was a dedicated advocate for disability rights , a devoted fan of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s , and most of all , a quality human being . I am heartsick over her passing , and wish I could have spoken to her before her death . The world of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > has lost a beautiful , radiant soul . I am the richer for having known her . 
Recently received part of my old collection back from a gentleman who stored part of it for 14 years in his basement . My ex-wife apparently moved it out to turn the old collection room into an office . It was a shock to see some of that stuff after all these years ... 
Well , the household just got bigger than ever ... we bought a < PROPFEMALE > Lab puppy to go with my wife , 6 kids , and two cats .... 
Well , it's Friday gain , and I am hoping for a productive weekend ... Chandra won the 50 meter breaststroke and the 50 meter backstroke at Montana State Special Olympics in Bozeman . Today she's running the 200 meter dash . We're very proud of her ! 
Just finished the article for Endless Summer Quarterly on The Beach Boys ' Sunflower album . It was fun to write about music for the first time in a few years . Thank you to < PROPFIRST > Beard for asking me to do it ! 
Just returned from 10 days vacation with 6 female family members , my son , and a dog driving in an RV from Billings to Morro Bay and back via Yosemite National Park . We were hosted by < PROPFEMALE>'s father and mother , and appreciate the gracious hospitality we received there . Beware of bison 6 feet high at the shoulder driving through Yellowstone at night .... t 
Memories of 2001 when Billings was last hit by a tornado ... Our county area was ruined , as was several businesses nearby . Spent some time in the basement with the tornado sirens going off ! Very much a reminder that Mother Nature is in charge ... 
It was a wonderful early summer day after some very bizarre storms this last weekend , and I am so grateful for it . Had dinner outside on the lawn , and remembered how sweet things can be if I just stop to enjoy them ... 
Just ordered < PROPMALE > Jardine's solo cd entitled Postcards From California . The tracks previewed on his website were quite well done . It is too bad that a label did not pick up this cd for distribution , but after all , most people wouldn't know < PROPMALE > with any kind of familiarity . Being a huge < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Gershwin aficionado , < PROPFIRST>'s new project of Gershwin tunes is very exciting ... 
It was just yesterday I called my dear friend < PROPMALE > Hanes and < PROPFEMALE > told me he couldn't talk ... he was too ill . < PROPMALE > died this morning at 12:15 am my time . I am so very sad and I don't know what to say except that I am glad to have known a man so full of spirit , so full of life . He was a < PROPFEMALE > among men , and I will not know his like again for many , many years . Farewell my friend , my beautiful friend ... 
It is moving to see the tributes pour in from all over the world for < PROPMALE > Hanes . His passing was noted on a few mailing lists , Facebook , and in emails to < PROPFEMALE > from the list of people who she kept aware of his changing health . What was both stunning and moving was the variety of walks of life from which the tributes came . This was truly a man for all seasons . 
Went to the doctor yesterday with a fever for a few days and spent $1000 in various tests finding out what I DID NOT have . Meanwhile , this morning , I'm feeling better . It's nice to know my basic health is solid , but it seemed like killing an ant with a mortar round .... 
It is lwhat would be my late mother's birthday today . I remember her and honor her memory today 
Thanks to < PROPMALE > B ., I had the privilege of hearing the entire < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Reimagines Gershwin cd on the phone . It is unspeakably lovely . Thanks !! 
Well , it's a quiet Sunday at home , with all 4 older kids visiting elsewhere . It's just the 2 year old and the 1 year old in diapers and the 5 month old Yellow Lab puppy . Believe it or not , it is actually quiet here ... 
Just got done with my second article about < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and The Beach Boys in 4 weeks ... thanks to < PROPFIRST > Beard and Endless Summer Quarterly for the invitation to write . It's been several years since I did something like that ... 
Well , our family is reunited today ... Sabrina , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > return from their dad's home today . It is nice to have them back , and I have missed them . Our family has a new appliance today , a dishwasher , which should make our lives much easier ... as we are a family of eight . Labor saving device indeed ! 
It is beginning to be Autumn in Montana with a few freaky exceptional days .... I love this time of year ... the aspen turn , school is back in session , and nights are cool .... 
Well . the kids` nursery has become their room ... it`s exciting because each room in our home is coming together ... the garage still awaits , heaven forbid ! 
Rough day in therapy , washed away by some fun singing in the church's first choir practice this evening ... add some music to your day ... 
If anyone is so inclined , check out the new Endless Summer Quarterly for my review of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Reimagines Gershwin and another article I wrote celebrating the 40th anniversary of Sunflower ... 
Never too late to think about what I am grateful for today .... 
Having some daddy/son time with Elom from Sesame Street on the dvd player . Stopped at the fire station earlier today and got to see the hook and ladder firetruck . My little girl and boy`s eyes were the size of saucers .... then they fell asleep ... 
This week is a week to remember what we are grateful for . For me it is my families ... the family that raised me and the family I am raising ... 
Home today with a sore back from a slip on ice from our late fall snowy weather . Lots to do , but too sore to move much . Tomorrow`s another day ....... 
It`s getting to the end of a very busy weekend , and it`s too bad there is not more time . But then again , who said time is ours anyway ? There is no better time spent than with family . 
It is one of those days when I am running from taking one kid or another to weekend activities .... community theater , working at McDonald`s , Special Olympics Snowshoeing , church , and so forth . Busy , busy , busy ..... more so than during the week ! 
Flat on my back today home sick ... I know now why I`ll never retire ! 
Dog tired tonight because my 18 month old son PJ decided party time was from 12 midnight to 3 am .... 
Listened to Pet Sounds last night , and was reminded what a < PROPFEMALE > it is ! 
I was listening to the first cd of Elvis`s 50s boxed set , and was reminded just how vital and creative those recordings are ... suffice to say that a < PROPMALE > highlight of them is < PROPMALE > Moore`s guitar playing . What a talent ! Of course Elvis`s energy is incredible . I`m not gonna do a Griel < PROPMALE > and analyze `em though ! 
The subject of a 50th anniversary Beach Boy box set has been mentioned several places recently . If you like their music , what would you like to hear on it ? 
One of my favorite prayers ... Keep watch dear Lord , with those who work , or watch , or weep this night , and give your angels charge over those who sleep . Tend the sick , Lord ; give rest to the weary , bless the dying , soothe the suffering , pity the afflcted , shield the joyous ; and all for your love`s sake . Amen . From the Book of Common Prayer-Compline 
It is wonderful to see people recover from the shattered lives that chemical dependence has caused them .... for all the miracles I have witnessed , I am really thankful ... for those still suffering , miracles happen every day ...
