Stupid cancer . We all want a new car , a new phone . A person who has cancer only wants one thing ... to survive . I know that a lot of you \who think you're too cool\ " probably won't re-post this . But a very small amount of my friends will . Put this on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer . "
