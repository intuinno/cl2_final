good days =) learning a lot , doing a lot 
I wanna write one like this . 
\What a curious life we have found here tonight . There is music that sounds from the street . \""

Mom made white chocolate covered peanut butter balls . I love existence . 
Sometimes the things we do or like surprise us . Leads me to wonder . I like it . 
Learning about emotion and time . 
I hate blood . 
A good day to reflect on life 
Lines 
Thank you for the fun , Tuck . I was thinking while we were playing and I'm gonna write a poem with a western theme . That's ... that's cool , right ? ha ha 
It's ... snowing ?! 
Ahhhh ! Sometimes my thoughts are supernovaes . A burst illuminates a lot in my head and it spreads quickly and changes the light on other thoughts I have -- stars that may explode -- and then the center of the first thought condenses and other thoughts start to gravitate toward the heavy thought . Then it takes another supernova to get out at times , so I wait or add pressure into smaller , less heavy spaces . 
Girls are unpredictable . This is both good and bad . 
The thing about forgiveness is it's the sick taking care of the sick . 
Excited for two days in a row off ! Lots of < PROPMALE > and all the Exorcism movies . Going to finish the song I thought of this morning , too . Topping it off with Event Horizon , the movie my dad says is the scariest . Kinda cool and new to think I'm excited about this , ha ha . 
I want a haircut and to visit Kentucky ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Tolliver ) for a week in March . 
Exercise , clean room , watch the Godfather , haircut , finish that one song and maybe the other (?) , then enjoy the rest of the day off 
I'm really excited to go back to Nicholasville for a week soon . It's going to be so weird at first , after having lived in another state ( and having a license from another state ) for nearly a year ( and that after having lived 100 < PROPMALE > away on a college campus for two years , too ... so , three years total ... ) ... I really want to be in Nicholasville though , soon , before I leave for the military . 
Aaaaand I need to pick an Air Force career . This is just like the < PROPMALE > picking thing in college ! Why is this such an ordeal for me ?! 
I'm really excited about the cd I'm almost finished with !, wanting to play Just Dance 2 or the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Wii game , don't have either , but maybe I'll just dance around the house when it's only me and < PROPMALE > Lafferty home , ha ha ha 
went for one realization today and stumbled onto a more real feeling one 
Dear precious radio ( though you won't be so precious once I throw you out the window for disobeying ) , PLAY LESS < PROPMALE > MARS and more Lady Gaga or < PROPFIRST > Derulo or something . 
Fortress of Solitude , Heaven , Mars , head , whatever you want to call it . 
=) I think I'll do that again 
This month's new discoveries : Glee , < PROPFEMALE > Lauper , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Rimbaud . 
80's music is on my palette lately . That's right . KISS , < PROPFEMALE > , Bon Jovi , Queen : lookin ' achyu . 
passed an armadillo on the way to work today . I really am in Texas ... 
frustrated lately 
The Vampire Lestat ... =) good book 
=) found something I want to do , have been doing , and would like to continue , but more emphasized . 
I've faith , but I don't hold belief in Christianity . If there were some other interpretation of Jesus's life , I might believe that . I've noticed that none of the 4 Gospels say Jesus was sinless . Only in later books , Hebrews 4:15 and 1 < PROPFIRST > 2:22 , is his sinlessness mentioned , and both were written a generation -- if not more -- after his death . That doesn't make Easter not a fine day to remember grace , though . 
is moving to < PROPFEMALE > , Florida in August 
Why do I mix up Caesar salad dressing with Italian dressing ?! Is it because they have to do with the same place ?? 
=) I think the lives of our friends are speakeasies in ages when living is discouraged . 
Interesting dreams lately 
I'm liking my walks at night . I'm going to sleep outside tonight . 
A bottle 
What a good day ... =) 
Swore into the Air Force =) 
I want blueberries when I grow up . I plan on having a blueberry patch . 
I've made my decision . I like < PROPFEMALE > more than DC , though Batman is still the best . \ 
Now to continue some letters to friends =)
