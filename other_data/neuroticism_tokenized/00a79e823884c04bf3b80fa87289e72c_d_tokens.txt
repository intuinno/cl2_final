Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid and their handicap is not contagious . They only want what we all want . To be accepted and loved . Can I make a request ? is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for atleast an hour ? It is special education week and this is in honor of ALL children born in a special and unique way . 
UGH ... I'm TRYING to watch the Matenrou Opera live stream BUT MY INTERNET IS TOO (*&%#()& *%) (@#* ^ SLOW ... oh my god . It keeps freezing every three seconds . FML . This internet ticks me off beyond belief sometimes .

Ugh . I'm so sick of always feeling so crappy . Really really really sick of it . A part of me wants to do so much and the other part feels too bad to do it . =\\ Maybe things will change over the summer ! Fffff . It's tiring being optimistic when nothing ever changes . 
Omg it's storming hardcore ... I don't want to leave school ! FOR ONCE . 
Aaaaaaa it's so pretty out today ! Hopefully it'll stay nice ... I haven't looked at the forecast today but I do know it's supposed to be in the 80s this weekend ! (*___*) \
