According to Indiana law , it is illegal for men who have a mustache to \habitually kiss human beings . \"" 
But a study has shown that men live up to five years longer if they kiss their wife before going to work . 
According to scientists , approximately 40 percent of twins under the age of five or six ( and some close-in-age siblings too ) have a language that they speak only with each other . Zow zare zou zhoing zhian ? xD
