Sesame Street ..... 

it's early , no creamer so my coffee is black , and nothing on tv , so low and behold my computer and the internet is my savoir . but i saw the sun rise , coffee is O.K. , and the internet is world wide so it looks to be like an ok day . 
another monday .... ugghhh . 
I have been so happy lately !! School is going great and no more bagels !! I miss the people but not the place . 
I still find each day too short for all the thoughts\ 
I want to think , all the walks I want to take , all the books I want to\ 
read , and all the friends I want to see . \
