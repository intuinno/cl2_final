wtf is Farkle ? 
I've decided that if some apocalypse hits and I somehow survive it , I'm moving into Montezuma's Castle . 
I have a lump in my throat again and the good ol ' body aches . I'm beginning to think I don't , nor have I the last 3 times I got sick , have a virus or anything of the sort . Nobody else who's getting sick also had a lump in their throat .

I've discovered that people will argue to the death over whether or not a female can \bulk up\ " without steroids . " 
bahahah . I love our team . Everybody standing up at work telling Merch to just call her back and leave a damn voicemail this time . 
In other news : my favorite jeans now officially have a hole in the butt . Used to just be a hole in the back pocket , but no , my buttocks are now visible . 
feels like a baby factory - no not because I'm manufacturing any of my own - just feel like the ground could fall from beneath my feet at any minute . 
Caprica - Greystone : \I wished for free publicity . I guess I should've been more specific . \ " Talk show host : \ " I feel a lot better about my monologue now . \ " awww . I thought it was funny . "

Highlights from previous post : RA : [ ... ] why not give them comprehensive sex-ed and the resources they need so they can prevent unwanted pregnancies ? CW : I hate to be rude [ ... ] When I was 10 years old , I knew how to access condoms . I didn't have to have anybody tell me . I had parents who talked to me . 
RA : what responsibility do we as a society have to take care of these children , especially the unwanted children ? [ ... ] And all of our resources here in California are completely drained . I recently did a show about school budget cuts and heard from teachers who are seeing more and more homeless children in the classroom . CW : You ask a good question . I don't know . You look at it with the screen over your eyes

I still get that little thrill every time someone says your name . 
went to bed around 7:30 /8 ish ( am ) . Tossed and turned until 9 . Got woken up at noon . Couldn't sleep after that . Giving everybody a warning now , I will be very cranky today . 
rawrg . 
also , this gigantic dog whose head went up to my belly button thought I was food . or did until he saw another dog and thought he wanted to mate with it . 
I have never seen a creature - animal or human - more hyper than Paysli . 
Why is this the first time I'm watching Definitely Maybe ?? <3 
is it too late to do something worth while ? 
Glee season finale was so lovely . 
Dear world : please stop with the pizza ads . They make me a sad , hungry panda . 
They say that when two people are in a good relationship , they make their own world - jokes , phrases and moments that are theirs alone - and our world is vast . 
omg . I haven't been that completely exhausted in .... actually I don't really remember having been that tired before . I'm sure it's happened sometime .

Am I a bad friend ? I feel like I've had a good run in this state , but everyone's drifting away - getting married and having kids . There's apparently no time for friends anymore . Maybe it's time to go on another journey ... make a new home , again . 
Why is there still crap in my lungs ? 
I'm making salsa . Pray I don't accidentally cut off my hands in the process . 
To us ... whoever the hell we might be . 
The Glades is AMAZING 
Paysli is like a freaking chipmunk ! She's been playing with the same piece of dog food for 20 minutes .

I've been trying to be more friendly at work . So far progress has been disappointing . Well hey , I tried . \

Oh . And I'm all in Rome and stuff now , which is not what I was expecting . It's strangely depressing looking . 
You don't need to have a cigarette to smoke in Rome . Just step outside and breath deep . 
leaving Rome today and doing some interesting touristy stuff ... and also I'm really tired . 
Sorento ? Across the bay from Pompeii . Gorgeous . 
Sorento is so gorgeous . Really , it's insane .

I'm watching this commercial for some inhaler and during the whole thing , the guy just keeps doing a circle around his truck with a rag . I'm not even listening to what he's saying anymore . All I can think is : \that is going to be one shiney fucking streak when this commercial is over . \""

I keep thinking that as I get older I'll get closer to wanting children ... but each year I like kids less and less 
some of these kids shows are actually quite hilarious 
Alright ... now I really don't ever want a dog . >:(

exhausted and still have more work to do . x_x 
saddest week ever :'( 
long day . I think some tea and reflection are called for ... 
so not used to this much human interaction . Do not want .

And why does everybody FREAK THE FUCK OUT on me the like 5 or 6 times a year I get into a fight . Everybody else fights PERPETUALLY but the one time I get in a fight it's the fucking end of the world and I'm some sort of devil woman . Seriously , everywhere I go , I have to listen to other people bicker with each other constantly , but I say one negative thing and everyone's jumping all over my shit about it .
