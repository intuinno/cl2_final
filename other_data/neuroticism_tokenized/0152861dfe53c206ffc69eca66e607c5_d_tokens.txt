I'd be lying to myself if i said it wasnt a dream . 

Its time to spread our wings and set soar to the lives we've known were coming . Lose ourselves in the midst of it all , and let go of the fears that hold us back . Life is but a game . Live it to its best . 
just got off , but im not tired . bullshit 
damn this shit just damn it all . we dont want it , but you need it . leave it be , forget it . and maybe , just maybe it'll all go away . 
haha thanks < PROPFEMALE > . so how ya been 
hahahaha .... thanks , but its a little too late too stay out of trouble ... lol 
thanks < PROPFEMALE > =] 
lol thanks < PROPFEMALE > . i like the enthusiasm 
why thank you mr. vollmer . lol 
haha thanks . \ 
have we ever actually talked in person ? lol 
thanks < PROPFIRST > . lol 
im officially 18 , and tonight the partys at Larrys house . its time to get crunk !!!! 
our mistakes in this world define us . they build us up and they break us down . all we can do is live past them and try to learn from them . hopefully everything is for the better now , but whats it really matter . life always moves on . 
One day the world will see what it has reaped . it will fall just like it has before . we are young in the age of Earth , for she is ancient and unforgiving . she will not let it stand much longer . 
The music blares , we all stand still . We hear every beat , we feel every note . Life is like a < PROPFEMALE > , very badly written , and mistakenly open ended . Is this a crescendo , or a morose \ 
diminuendo ? I guess only time can tell as we continue to listen to the < PROPFEMALE > that we call life . 
Days come and days go by , almost like nothing ever happened . The only thing we have to remember them are the memories and the scars . So learn to live . Make the memories , get the scars . They only hurt once . 
so whats the count , like 180 more days starting tomorrow and its finally over . 
another day gone by , another thought dripping down my spine . the day we see it all will be the day we reap what we've wrought . 
These days everything is like a passing rain . Its all come and go , and sometimes you get left out in the cold . Maybe you'll get lucky and have some company while you're out there . After all , who doesnt enjoy playing in the rain ? 
Sometimes in life you're up , others , well you're just not . And for those times when you are up , it feels like you're never going to come down again . And when you're down , it feels like you're never going up . This wonderful circle of life . 
round'n'round we go . our eyes meet , and they quickly look away , as if frightened by a thought . scared for a moment by a creeping dream remembered , buried deep and rooted in . why dies it burn to see it , that look ? when i catch your glance , and it departs from the field . 3 strikes and nothings left . and now . i cant even count the strikes on my hands . 
Light the sky as bright as the sun . Feel the < PROPFEMALE > as it burns us into time . Let it shape us , let it hold us . Light up the sky , and let it take us . 
The sun shines brighter with every breath you take , the < PROPFEMALE > grows fuller with every move you make , together one may only tell that one was ever alone , but apart they each stand out like earth herself . 
The blue sky just isnt the same when i look up and feel the blues . it seems more of a gray , and less of a happy day . so brighten up and lay a field of dreams old chap , maybe things will just go away . 
Lets write a tune , better yet , lets live the beat . Tap the notes , hum the rhythm . Sing the song and lets get to steppin . This song is for you , it is for me . Its for all the ones like me and you and you and me . So step to the beat and get with the flow cause all we're doing is moving . Two steps forward , one step back . Keep it up and maybe you'll get it . All ya gotta do is love . 
When you smile , the whole world stops and stares for a while . 
7080617 Is no longer my phone number . id feel like posting my new one so if you want it just get ahold of me . lol 
oh dear bed you do sound great right now . 
ya gotta love overtime =] 
you're a biiiitch 
this life we lead has many roads . how are we to know which path is right and which is wrong ? so many different choices that affect so much more than we know but how do we know where to go ? sometimes this life we lead is harder than the life itself and it leaves us empty and baron if we sray the wrong way . please just let me choose the right path . 
15 hours yesterday .. and ready to do it all again today . yay lol < PROPFEMALE > christmas ! 
maybe a little late ... but happy new year , maybe this year some of the people who live on here will find some kind of life . lol 
the days stack up , but the weeks fly by . every step is a decision we make so step in the right direction and things may go your way . you never know when you're going to wake up and your while life has flown by . 
im breeding a monster within me . growing and changing and always hating . it takes it all but its not enough . maybe its time to be the monster ive become . 
im playing on a tight string . one wrong note and the string snaps and the song is ruined and everything ive lived through , love , hate , anger , depression , happiness , lonliness , high times and low tomes , will all have been for nothing . 
theres something right over the horizon . things are about to change , things are about to get big and the wind blew me in the right direction . im gonna ride it out and see where i end up . 
yay ... work =] 
sleep and a shower sounds great 
who knows what , you know who , we all know it was but you'll never know who . 
living in this place is like jumping on a trampoline . you go up and up but you always come back down sometime . 
this game was old when it started . dont push it . 
spinning round and round this merrygoround goes . up and down we go . slowly spinning but never stopping but i dont think i even want it too . 
nothings ever going to be the same , so i guess all there is to do is step up to this new development and start again . 
on a plane or a train or even a boat or a car , lets leave this place and never return . the memories can only do so much before they tear us down . so leave them here with the rest and begin again . 
the dark side of light was never meant to be shown . its a nightmare in paradise covered with smiles . let it be and itll be okay they say .. but who are they to say anything ? 
i live at dominos . but i made a badass pizza . 
if you're into grind metal look up < PROPFEMALE > grin . badass 
yesterday i didnt see the world the way i see it today . everything was different and now things have been misconstrued and id even know what im looking at . but what i do know is you , and thats my faovrite part about tomorrow . 
its strange to think i dont have to go to work tomorrow .. lol i dont even remember my last day off . 
to lie here under you is all i could ever do . 
how much cocain can < PROPFIRST > sheen do ... enough to kill two and a half men ... haha 
brandii i will murder youuuuuuuu lol 
day and night have blended together . which is it now ? 
darling you're my angel , come and save me tonight . you're my angel , come and make it alright . 
the dentist .. is certifiably evil . 
to get up or to stay in bed .. that is the question .
