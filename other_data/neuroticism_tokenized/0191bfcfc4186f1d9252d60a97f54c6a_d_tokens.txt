So I guess I had a good day ... for an hour . 
To < PROPFEMALE > Slaughter : \Ahh ! I hate music ! * Throws nearest object at wall *\" * Laptop actually accidentally gets kicked off the bed and hits wall * Look what you did " 
The secret of forgiving everything is to understand nothing ... 
So , < PROPFEMALE > Hartley is coming over tomorrow , On Broadway Saturday , and partying it up with sisters < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and Brielle < PROPMALE > . It shall be Epic ! :) 
You and I left our troubles far behind :)

The logical thinking skills of my family never cease to amazing me ... :) 
\New TV\ " entitles us to watch it all day :) " 
Nothing like watching Sesame Street with the babies :) 
It takes extraordinary talent to lose your phone in your sleep . 
Thank goodness for friends within walking distance :) 
Nothing like time with family <3 
Pooring drinks on slanted surfaces is not reccomended . Well apparently I didnt know that . 
Music is life . Some people just don't understand . 
Was sick today . Missed jazz auditions , which means another 5 or 6 days of freaking out . Delightful . 
Jammed the escalator at the mall on accident with a < PROPFEMALE > ... Hahaha ! 
\I KNEW it would happen ! My therapist said it wouldn't happen BUT IT DID ! \ " Oh good times :) We love bad Disney movies ! " 
Only I would lose my phone running in the dark when its about to rain :) 
Don't make opinions of me based off what other people tell you ... That's not cool . Thanks :) 
Four days four days four days four days .... 
I can't be happy all the time . 
Rain wasn't on my agenda today . But neither was slamming my hand in the door , hitting my head on the doorknob , or falling down the stairs . Luck is the enemy ... 
Only THREEish days until < PROPFIRST > with loves < PROPFIRST > Else , < PROPFIRST > Lisle , Brennyn Hawbaker , and < PROPFEMALE > McKim ! And my ever so favorite counselors :) It'll be a long few days ...

Another busy day ... At least I get to spend it with awesome peoples ! :) 
Rifle :) Enough said .

< PROPFEMALE > España !!! :) 
I seek motivation ... I'm running low . Very low . 
I think I'll try defying gravity :) 
Ha ha , Dad , I am watching House and it is medically inaccurate and you can't stop me from watching it !!! Because it's addicting ... And this is what happens when I'm stuck at home . 
I have dreams , and nothing will stop me from reaching them :) 
Is awesomely tired . 
My family and friends are the most amazing people I know . 
Grace Baccam's room = Clean . For the first time ever . Mine = Sheet music and instruments everywhere . What has the world come to ? Confusion . 
My dearest Brielle < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Hernandez , \ 
Do you remember when we made that cupcake skit ? Hilarity . I miss you both with all my heart ! I'm coping okay though , because Gabby Magee is filling the hole in my heart you guys left ... :) Anyway , that was my status dedicated to ( some of ) my three best friends in the whole world . \ 
Love times a million , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > . 
Has 7 siblings for the next three weeks . Awesome <3

Hanging out with Malie Luong and Lavie Luong and other wonderful family members . Home is fun sometimes . Lyly L , we wish you were here though . 
Lavie Luong , you are a loser . Even though you won ... 
Oh , no offense my family loves but I miss my friends . A lot . A LOT .

Today ( yesterday ) was a beautiful day , despite any problems we might have faced . I love our family . Both ours and our new . I now proceed to sleep . Goodnight :) 
I had SUCH an amazing weekend ... Back to the real world of flags and rifles ! 
My schedule is running slightly behind ... Perhaps I will be home by 1:30 so I can have enough energy to Guard it up in the morning . 
To all my < PROPMALE > cousins ( and Aunt ) who stayed at my house ( Lavie Luong , Malie Luong , Nalin Luong ) I wish you a safe trip home . I love you , I'll miss you .

Making almost happy memories with Brielle ...? 
At Wartburg All-State camp with wonderful people ! 
Thunderstorm , lightning , rain , flash floods , long drive , I hate you . Otherwise it was a sucessfully musical weekend . More to come this week . 
Good job Spirit and Millennium ! I'm proud of us ! 
Had a busy day . Needs to do Honors homework . And epically fails as busing tables ( an already known fact ) . 
Honors English Homework Weekend Lockdown begins now ... 
Honors English Homework Lockdown failed . Tomorrow . :) 
The honors homework scramble begins now ... Wish me luck :) 
Tonight's Goal : Finish Honors homework in the time it takes to eat 5 Jolly Ranchers ... 
Is going to post a stereotypical status about the first day of school . But seriously , let the staying up late , frequent music practice , and procrastinating homework begin . Here comes freshman year ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Baccam is my favorite sister . :) 
My cousin , < PROPMALE > Lovan , has finally decided he needs a girlfriend . < PROPMALE > ie < PROPMALE > , me and Savanh Lovan your favorite cousins are proud of you . Also we're glad to embarrass you publicly on Facebook , like so . 
Brielle < PROPMALE > just cannot handle my violin music . It's way above your level of music perception anyway , you just don't understand . * Cries * Anyway , you're okay . 
How far will talent take you ? Mixed with hard work ? To the sky , I hope . 
Today was not a good day . But tomorrow will be ? 
Motivation for flute- Please come back before I punch you in the face . - < PROPFEMALE > Baccam 
Late night homework/practice ? Bring it on ... 
Is determined to have a fantastic weekend consisting of family , friends , music , and other good things of that nature . 
< PROPFEMALE > Hernandez , Brielle < PROPMALE > , we are bringing back the THOUGHTS NOTEBOOK ! 
Was going to ice the bruise on my < PROPFEMALE > , but ended up dropping the rock hard ice pack on my bruise . Life , why do you hate me so ? 
Sometimes the world tries to knock it out of you , but I believe in music the way people believe in fairytales . 
To me , words don't come easy without a < PROPFEMALE > . 
Music is the reminder that we are not the only things in the universe . 
Procrastinates on everything . EVERYTHING . 
So , apparently , ich muss < PROPFIRST > Bieber töten . < PROPFEMALE > Jones , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > DeBoer ... 
< PROPMALE > Lovan needs to get rid of creepy < PROPMALE > guys that creep on his profile . Savanh Kanga Lo < PROPFIRST > agrees with me . You'll never get a girl if that keeps up . And then our goal would fail ... LOVE YOU ! 
Sore throat/lost voice relapse ? Not cool . 
Caution : Hardwood floor slippery with socks on ... Ouch . 
is doing what she does best ... Cramming ! 
I miss Chicago . ( Grace Baccam : DING ! Wacker . ) 
Lavie Luong , Malie Luong , Nalin Luong : Don't open the dishwasher . You WILL die . 
Tonight , I actually hit a volleyball over the net , made new friends , AND there was a shooting < PROPFEMALE > . This is a sign ! 
My music playlist has been reduced to the two All-State etudes and < PROPFIRST > Fantasy . My life is over . 
< PROPFIRST > Hornback are hilarity . In a bad way . 
AND < PROPFIRST > Hornback are hilarity . In a bad way . 
Love is an act of endless forgiveness , a tender look which becomes a habit . 
Hey friends and family , I apologize in advance for totally locking myself in my room for the whole month of October . I'll be musically cramming ! I love you all ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Hernandez , Brielle < PROPMALE > , I miss you . 
I like it on the bed ! 
Renew your youth , restore your soul ! :) 
40 days until my bestest < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Mertzenich and I are reunited ! 
I wish motivation came in bigger packages . 
< PROPFEMALE > Slaughter is my bestest < PROPMALE > because she puts up with me . I couldn't ask for anything more . 
is pulling a miracle in 10 days ? I'm thinking yes . 
< PROPFEMALE > Boothroyd made my day with our awesome Scrubs handshake . So did the cat in the stroller . 
had almost fun at Perkins with < PROPFIRST > Hornback and < PROPFEMALE > Pudenz ... :) 
can see the headlines now ... \Flute player breaks/badly injures finger 6 days before All-State auditions\ " . Cool . " 
So my flute felt the need to break today . As well as my finger . Okay . 
Don't think too hard . Relax , have fun . :) 
Scales will be the death of me . This is when I realize < PROPFEMALE > Slaughter was right back in 7th grade when she told me I should practice them more ... :) 
Skype with Malie Luong and Nalin Luong ... Until it broke ! :( 
Life goes on . A lesson still in the process of being learned . :) And GOOD JOB EVERYONE TODAY ! < PROPMALE > love to you all . 
Skyped with Lavie Luong ... Cheered me up ! LOVE YOU ! 
And the night shall be filled with music ... And the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents and silently steal away :) 
Now loves her flute section ! < PROPFEMALE > Rossmann , Madi Flesch , < PROPFEMALE > McKeon , < PROPFEMALE > Robles , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . :) Keep it UP ! And good luck on chair tests ... May the best flute win :) 
Brielle < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Hernandez : \What ? Flutes can go flat ? I thought you just pressed the button and it was right . \ " PS < PROPMALE > is creepy . ( < PROPFEMALE > Slaughter made All-State but I'm playing in the 6th grade concert ) Hahaha love my bestest friends ! "

Choir discussions are best over dinner and the car . Had a fun time tonight ! :) 
I'm not in the Thanksgiving mood yet ... The solution : A < PROPFIRST > Brown Thanksgiving ! 
Nokkao : * After waiting in traffic line * We pass you up ! BITCHES ! I love city drivers . :) 
Having a doctor as a father is wonderful .... Like when he opens to his textbook at dinner and says , \Do you want to see oral cancer ? \ " Yeah ... no . " 
Went to see < PROPFEMALE > Palin at Borders ... Ended babysitting 2 random kids . An overall successful night ! 
\*Provactively * I NEEEED you ! \ " - Mrs. Engels :) "

Oprah told me why I love music ... It lights me up and lets me know I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing . :) Thank you Oprah ! 
Looking forward to another great year with the best people ever ! 
You must have reason to be in places to which you go , and you must only do things you really care about . 
It's easier to play when it's right from your heart . Tone will come and your fingers will follow . 
Don't believe what your eyes tell you . Look with your understanding ! 
Don't think to much ... It's not good for you . :) 
Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind . Seriously . 
In your mind , hear it perfectly , musically , expressively  know exactly what you want to happen , note by note .... 
Let your heart drop once , then know it's not the end . Just another path . :) 
Shut up and don't bother me . I'm trying to fly , here ! :) 
If it's worth doing , it's worth doing spectacularly . 
The best day of your life is the day on which you decide your life is your own . :)

Love is fragile , and we're not always its best caretakers . We muddle through and hope this fragile thing survives . 
Music's a powerful thing . One song can can change your mood , make a memory . :) 
I think I set a record . I have effectively missed every single one of my flute teacher's calls in the past 2 years ... 
My name is < PROPFEMALE > and I enjoy not signing out ! < PROPFEMALE > Huynh is my idol . She's so awesome . I've been graced with the honor of having a status written by her . <3 
Headin ' to my hometown , the big WI ! 
Is successfully failing Honors English . Already . And it feels so good ... 
Vacation is always fun until a child vomits ... < PROPFEMALE > has vomit phobia !!!!!! 
Having someone help you doesn't mean you failed . It just means you're not in it alone .

After the rain , the sun shines . 
I don't let go of concepts - I meet them with understanding . Then they let go of me . :) 
< PROPMALE > Flesch's finest moment = getting stabbed by < PROPFIRST > Cunningham via COD ... Best thing ever , right Kenzie < PROPFEMALE > Flesch ? 
I love the flute , because when three family members come in your room to bug you , you can just obnoxiously blow a high D to make them go away . 
Every day I'm shufflin'! With Savanh Lovan via Skype . :) 
Practicing > Homework . 
Never go coning with a snow cone . It doesn't work out so well . 
< PROPMALE > Flesch is a cranky , whiny baby ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Hwang needs to learn how to manage technology better ... AKA Plug in her computer when it's going to die ... 
It is difficult to say what is impossible , for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow . 
I have an obsession with white cars . I know this because I spent half of Iron Man 2 admiring the beautiful white Audi R8 Convertible ... 
My day was made when I was the first one to find out my most favorite person/cousin is coming to the US next month ! Lyly L , everyone ! 
I try every day to < PROPFEMALE > every moment , love every memory , and embrace every possibility . :) You should too ! 
Let your heart drop once , then know it's not the end ... Just another path . :) 
Sometimes I like to sit in my car and turn on Symphony Hall and just sit there because I'm not allowed to drive it ... 
12 days ... Not that I'm counting , Lyly L . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Slaughter and I definitely bring out the worst in each other ... \

The first conversation I have when I walk in ... \ 
Me : Why is my shark so warm ? \ 
Lyly L : It's ALIVE ! \ 
Me : I thought sharks are cold-blooded ... \ 
Lyly : Well not in warm water ! Hahaha <3

You don't need to know everything . You just need to know a lot about a lot . - Mrs. < PROPMALE > :) 
\Where's Grace Baccam ? Does she not sleep at home anymore ? \ " -Aunt Nichole\ 
Most productive day ever with best friends < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ... And < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > Niccole Wiles kinda ... ;) 
Sometimes the truth you would prefer not to hear is the same truth that will set you free . 
Assigning blame takes focus away from doing what it takes to fix a situation ... Always be moving forward . 
< PROPFEMALE > Baccam and I are 15.5 today ! AKA 6 months until the biggest house party ever ... ;) 
It's going to be a great day . :)
