Hidee ho ... we had a great Easter ... new grandbaby arrived ... uh-huh , that's right , new girl in town ... and what a cutie !! I will let her daddy post her pictures though , don't want to take away too much of his thunder ... Baby < PROPFEMALE > has arrived !! We were so blessed and on Easter Sunday ... God loves us !! 

I love my deck on a day like today .. out there , I can feel the crispness of the wind on my face , hear the leaves waving back & forth , I can smell the wetness of the air , the earth ; I can feel God .. this house is perfect for that , no noisy street just outside , no exhaust fumes , just simple perfection ... 
Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers ... you mothers !! Especially those in my family ... and my friends ... really , Happy Mother's Day ! love you all 
I miss my new granddaughter ... been sick , the two grandkids here and me , so we haven't seen Baby < PROPFEMALE > since forever !! Okay , maybe not that long but too long , plus , it's < PROPFIRST>'s birthday today ... a big one ! Missing out on that too ... at least I went to the doc this time ( thanks < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > for the push ) and got meds ... big sigh ... 
We took < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > to Chili's for dinner last night ; what a thrill ! They were adorable , of course , not at all shy with < PROPMALE > saying hello , thank you , goodbye and Monie was so precocious , so cute with it all .. they devoured the onion strings and corn dogs and mandarin oranges ... it was loud in there which made it perfect for them , no worries about being loud ! Fun ! 
Vacation time ... not to Oregon as previously planned due to < PROPFIRST>'s illness but vacation , staycation as long as I'm not working , not at home , I'll be happy ! All 6 days of it too !! So grateful to have a brother who is willing to do the work for me while I'm gone , thank you God for him ! Vacation is nigh !! I am so happy !! 
What's on my mind ? 9 years , 9 months , 3 days = 3563 total days ... those of you close enough will know what that means ... count down to 10 years , double digits , God willing ... 
Has anyone been watching Sing Off ? It's time to vote and I'm torn ! They were all very , very good last night , very , very , very good ... I have liked and cheered for all the groups that are left ! How am I supposed to vote now ??? I want to vote ! But how do I choose ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !! Haha ... I'm all done wrapping and stockings and stuff ! Have a < PROPFEMALE > one !
