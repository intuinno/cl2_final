OK , I just have to say this . Everyone has a right to their own feelings and opinions , and here's mine : To wish that your state rival looses the NCAA national football championship ( unless they are playing against your team ) demonstrates a TOTAL LACK OF CLASS . Personally , I hope Alabama wins and wins big . War Eagle AND Roll Tide !! 
Up to 46 fans ( from among my friends ) for I'll bet I can find 1,000,000 people who think music education is important . THANKS ! Now , invite your other friends ! 
I'm finished with AQ , PQ , and CQ ... I'm Q'd out ! Easy < PROPFIRST > , Easy < PROPFIRST > , Easy < PROPFIRST > ! ( This probably won't mean anything to my non-Delta friends ) 
Anyone have any suggestions for good restaurants and/or must sees/do's in Prague , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , or Rome ?

AUBURN UNIVERSITY SINGER < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > SPENCER --- MISS HOMECOMING 2010 !!!!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > friends , Just in case you want to bid off for the AU Singers Fall Show , it is Dec . 4 @ 7:30 and Dec . 5 @ 2:30 and 7:30 . You won't want to miss it !!!! It's Glee on steroids !!!! 
I wonder how many extra sections ( flights ) < PROPFEMALE > will have to PHX around < PROPFIRST > 7 , 8 , 9 . Let me know when ya'll are going . Maybe I can work your flight ! \ 
It's great to be an Auburn Tiger !!!! \ 
There's another group of Auburn Champions playing tomorrow at 230 and 730 : The Auburn University Singers !!!! Auburn High School . Finish this great weekend on a \high Note ! \"" 
Auburn Friends , < PROPFEMALE > has added flights BHM-PHX January 8-11 . But be warned : very high fares . Go to delta.com 
Auburn friends , disregard my previous post . I think those were charters . Sorry ! 
AUBURN FANS !!! Are you Phoenix bound ??? Anyone on < PROPFEMALE > flight 8771 from Birmingham on January 8 ? I'll be one of your flight attendants . 
Took an airplane full of Auburn fans from BHM to PHX today . In spite of the fact that we did not get catering ( therefore very few adult beverages , ran out of ice , no promised meal in f/c ) , they were great !!!! Of course , as I told them , it was not surprising since they were Auburn folks . And we did a big WARRRRRR EAGLE on taxi in !!! 
Kentucky just passed the best law ever . To be on Food Stamps , Medicaid , or Cash Assistance for your children or yourself , you have to pass a DRUG test . Every other state should pass a similar law . If people who work have to take a drug test to be employed , people who receive assistance should have to take one also . Just sayin ' 
I feel like the proudest Dad in the world !! First , my niece , < PROPFEMALE > , has been offered a position as a < PROPFEMALE > flight attendant . One of my students , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is currently Auburn University's Miss Homecoming 2010 , and it was just announced that another student , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , has been voted Miss Auburn 2011 !!!! Both < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > were nominated by the AU Singers . 
Happy birthday , < PROPFIRST > !!! 
A post from a friend : There comes a time in your life when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living .
