Had an awesome New Years at < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo ( aka my sister ) house !!! :D Got to spend time over there with her and my nephews , as well as my cuz Chyna AsianSensation Alvarez ! Chyna also fixed up my hair last night and I just wanna thank her so much for it ! I also wanna thank my sister for having me over ! I hope to see you guys again sometime this month and I can't wait to go to church tomorrow ! 
I CANNOT fucking wait until OCTOBER !!!!!!!!! My gf will be here , and we'll be going to Youmacon at the Hyatt during Halloween weekend !!!!! 8D 
Packing my bags and heading for Ohio in the morning ! We're staying a couple nights at the Kalahari resort ^^ I'm going along with my mom , < PROPFEMALE > ( niece ) , < PROPFIRST > ( nephew ) , my aunt < PROPFIRST > , my grandma < PROPFIRST > Pardo , and my cousins < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Myren . It's going to be a BLAST ! : ' D 
Well , I would've wrote about it sooner but we got back from our vacation Friday , thanks to the dumbasses in charge of my mom's short term disability . We couldn't even fucking enjoy our vacation because they screwed her over on her check :| Damn fuck heads . 
Praying that she'll get the job at McDonalds . The interview was yesterday and I thought I just about bombed it ! x_x ;;; When it came to talking about myself , I totally went blank ! AGH !!! @_@ ;;;;;; 
I'm very thankful my mom is going back to work because she has been driving me UP A DAMN WALL !!!!!!! Seriously , this woman drives me nuts @_@ ;;;; I just need to work on getting a job or just graduating and then getting one and then make plans to move > w >;;; 
Damn , my feet hurt so bad ! x_x My mom and I went shopping at Target * and * Kroger with all the coupons she printed off . I think we bought * way * too much though ' cause the back end of the car scraped when we pulled out of Kroger , and it doesn't usually do that ! XD 
I'm really anxious about Youmacon coming up ! To think , it'll be here in almost a month ! And my gf will be here in less than a month :D I cannot WAIT until the convention is here ! So many Otaku to associate with @w @ 
Tired as hell ! I need to stop staying up late and getting very little sleep x_x ;;; Gonna take my mom to physical therapy in a bit . 
Trying not to get too worried about all these sudden slight anxiety attacks happening . It might just be nerves but it's happening too often ! I can't even enjoy a whole week ! ARGH ! >:( 
Today is the day I start my diet ! Gotta do whatever I can to get down to a healthier weight :) Also got a dentist appointment today for fillings , agh ! 
In a pretty shitty mood . Things aren't going according to plan for Youmacon . My girlfriend is left without a costume and because of this she refuses to go to Youmacon , no matter how much I try to talk her into it . I don't know what to do now :'( 
Still feeling like absolute SHIT ! I still don't feel any better about all the drama that ensued last night with my gf . I was hurtin ' like no tomorrow deep within my soul :'( Gawd I can't wait until 10/24 , Halloween party & booze ... nice . ( And no , I'm not an alchoholic . ^^ ;) 
HOLY SHIT !!!!!!!! I got my cosplay today !!!!!!!!!! This made me so happy :) The only thing is that if my gf doesn't get a < PROPMALE > to get one then I won't be cosplaying at Youmacon . She granted me that one condition and I accepted it . Because I * really * wanted her to go to Youmacon with me :') 
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY LAPTOP IS TOTALLY FUCKED UP !!!!!!!!!!! It won't even start up right and I don't have the system recovery disk for it ;3 ; Gotta take it back to RAC . 
Can't wait , I'm so excited ! My girl is supposed to get here on Wednesday . I'm gonna surprise her and pick her up from the greyhound station XD 
OMG I'M BACK ! 8D 
I miss my girlfriend :( I probably won't be seeing her until February or sometime in summer , depending on if I'll be able to go to Naka-Kon or not . I cried when she had to leave on Tuesday :'( 
Super nervous about a driver's test I'm about to have in a couple hours . It's at 2:30 and I'm really nervous ! D: I might pass ... or FAIL !!!!!!!!! ; w ; 
OMG I PASSED MY ROAD TEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @_______@ ;;; 
Trying to figure out what to make for my friends on deviantArt . Might make a huge picture or little sketch requests ... not sure <3 
Tryin ' to figure out what to get my bro for his birthday . He didn't really drop any hints on what to get him . Maybe we should get him a GameStop gift card ... Oh well , he's gonna be 29 on Monday ! :D 
I hate it when my dad acts like a big fucking asshole . He never has anything nice to say and when you say something to him he gets a fucking attitude . I'm just really sick and tired of this shit right now >.< 
After two years of waiting ... I FINALLY GOT MY WII !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm playing my one and only Wii game non-stop : Super < PROPFIRST > Galaxy ! I need more games xD ;;; 
MY BRO LET ME BORROW SSBB !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I just need to practice more because I suck at playing against other people online XD 
Had a dream last night about < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo and Chyna AsianSensation Alvarez . Kinda weird because they were at my old Elementary school ( I think my sis was working there , I dunno ) and we chatted for a while and stuff . I can't remember more because it's all still hazy xD maybe its a sign to < PROPFEMALE > out with ' em or something . I dunno XD I love them both though ! :) 
needs a hair cut ... badly D: 
Got a bit of a headache right now x.x ;;;; Gonna go and play some more Brawl . I just unlocked Falco , Snake and LUCARIO !!!!!!!!!!!!! I gotta play more now !!! :D 
I can't wait !!! My birthday is in just a couple of days !!! I'm so excited ! I'm not sure what I'm doing on my birthday , but for it I know we're supposed to go out to Chili's!!! :D 
Going out to eat with my mom , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! :) We're going to < PROPMALE > Village for dinner , and I hope we all have a nice family dinner together ! :D 
Today is my birthday !!!!!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XD I'm surprised at how many people are saying Happy Birthday to me today . It wasn't like this last year at all o_o I'M JUST SO HAPPY NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS EVERYONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) 
Getting tired of hearing my mom constantly bitch at ME about everything ! I need a damn vacation >>;;; 
Just got Dominos delivered to my house ! My last day to enjoy good food that's bad for me XD Decided to stay home and chill while I talk to my girl for the New Year . I hope you all have an awesome New Years < PROPFEMALE > ! :D 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE BALL DROP 2 MORE MINUTES ! :D 
HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D

Liquid Plumr needs to gimme my money back . Their product did NOT work at all ! >:( 
Did my exercises today ! :D Felt so good ! :) I'm keeping track of my NYR's on some site and getting back on track to get healthy ! 
Watching GHI with my mom . Dad is watching too , but he's just criticizing the show -_-;;; 
About to exercise right now . But first I gotta take out the trash and grab the mail . And I should be going to bed on time tonight because I only got maybe 2 1/2 hours of sleep today x_x ;;; 
Had a wonderful day at church !!!! I went with < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo , my nephews , Chyna AsianSensation Alvarez and < PROPFIRST > :D I definitely heard what I needed to hear today . It was about trials and tribulations . We're not really being punished , we just have obstacles in our way . And I finally understand now , I see everything in a new light now :) 
I ran over a noodle at the dinner table because that's how I roll . XD 
Addicted to MapleStory !!!!!!!!! I can't stop playing it ! It makes me want to abandon all the facebook apps ! Lol ! 
has been feeling like crap for the past couple of days !!!! I'm more than likely sick :( Runny nose and a sore throat . I don't know what's next . And I don't know if I'll be able to go to church tomorrow ; w ; 
Had an AWESOME day at church !!! Even if I was sick , I managed to have a good time ! :) I hope to be more lively next Sunday . Can't wait to see my sis , Chyna , < PROPFIRST > , and the boys again ! :) 
I STRONGLY DISLIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE GET MAD AT ME FOR STUPID REASONS . AND I ALSO * STRONGLY * DISLIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME I SHOULD ACT A CERTAIN WAY JUST BECAUSE THEY KNOW I GO TO CHURCH !!! I AM WHO I AM !!! 
Been crying for probably half the day today . Two of my favorite characters from Death Note , < PROPMALE > & Mello , died today :'( Today was their death date and it made me cry so much knowing that . I was dreaded the day that they would die . Call me weird if you want , I always cry when my favorite fictional characters die X'D 
is tired of NOT having a damn job ! Seriously , I've been looking for about 2-3 years already and NOBODY is hiring >:( It's pretty depressing , honestly ;_; 
so wants to get an iPad right now D: It looks awesome , even if people make fun of it . Maxi iPad XD Then again , I made fun of it like that too !!! :D I still want one o_o 
Ugh , the smell of dog food makes me want to barf right now D: 
Finally found my wallet ... it was by the computer buried under stuff ... oi = w =;;; 
Had a pretty good day today . Wasn't horribly bad , kinda good :) I just hope tomorrow is even better ! ^_^ 
I want to go see The Wizard of Oz at the Fisher Theater :'( 
I really need to quit watching \1000 Ways to Die\ " o_o ;;;" 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments . 
Ugh , the vision in my left eye is kinda worse now that I've been neglecting wearing my glasses o_ <;;; I'll have to get stronger glasses when I get a < PROPMALE > >>;; 
Ugh ... feel sick to my stomach x_x ;;; Maybe I ate something something bad ><;;; 
Just got done watching Zombieland and The Hangover with < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo and Chyna AsianSensation Alvarez . Totally awesome movies XD 
Oww , oww , oww , my skull is on fire x_x ;;;;;; 
OMG ... TOO MUCH SNOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! X_X ;;;; 
Oh yeah !!!! Back on track with my weightloss today ! I feel very motivated and pumped right now !!!! > w < 
I wish my head would quit burning so much . I haven't been on the net almost ALL day and it STILL acts up ! ><;;; Well , I'm gonna pray on it , though :'( 
I hate the snow BECAUSE I * ALWAYS * HAVE TO FUCKING SHOVEL IT !!!!! AND DO PEOPLE THANK ME , NO ! THEY BITCH IF I DON'T FUCKING SHOVEL OUT THEIR PARKING SPOT OR IF I DON'T BRUSH THE DAMN SNOW OFF THE CAR FAST ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET TO WORK ! NO APPRECIATION WHATSOEVER ! ><;;;;;; Can't you just tell I had a bad morning start ? :/ 
Going out to shovel the snow AGAIN . I swear Michigan is a pain in the ass to live in :/ I wish I could just go out sledding with people ; w ; 
OMG I feel like I've been beaten with a shovel x_x ;;; My back hurts , my legs hurt , just hurtin ' all over @_@ ;;; No more shoveling for me ><;;; 
I hate it when I feel like crying for no apparent reason ._. ;;; 
Bored ' cause I dunno what to do x_x ; I might draw ... but my mama wants to watch a movie . * sigh * Off to watch a movie : / 
No movie tonight ! :o Mom's head was hurtin ' and she's not feeling too good so she's off to bed . The only ones awake with me are my dogs ! :D 
Been sick to my stomach all of last night and this morning . I think I might hate buffets now x_x ;;;; Totally not worth feeling like crap ><;;; 
Feeling so miserable right now . Been feeling emotional for a few days and now I just broke down completely . I hate being depressed T_T 
Cleaning < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo's place ! I wanted to wait til noon so I wouldn't make other people in the building mad with a vacuum that sounds like a siren o_o ;;;; 
I sucks that those you love the most can end up hurting you the most :'( 
Having allergies sucks XD 
Going to sleep finally ! Night ya'll! ;) 
Exercising !!!! :) 
Oh boy , what a night/day x_x ;;; There was a fire about 1-2AM last night . Only a few houses away from ours . Now I'm a bit freaked out and just about afraid to leave the house now because I'm afraid that we'll have to go through this fire bullshit AGAIN . I'm praying extra hard that nothing happens . Because it's been just about 6 years since the fire , and I do NOT want to go through more pain from it again :'( 
Watchin ' some ShayTards on Youtube :P 
Doing last minute cleaning this morning ! The house is looking lovely * w * 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day , guys ! I hope you're all not getting TOO wasted now . Gonna have me some drinks later ;) 
Had a few drinks tonight , and not feeling anything . Why can't I feel drunk yet ? XD And I'm also obsessed with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s \Waking Up In Vegas\ " song @_@ " 
Cooking corned beef , cabbage , potatoes & carrots . This should've been done yesterday but SOME PEOPLE forgot to take the corned beef out the freezer >:( Also today is a dreadful reminder , I'll have to read my bible for comfort . 
Reading to take my mind of my anxiety right now . Grrr ... I hate slight attacks sneaking up on me :( 
Son of a biscuit eating bulldog !!!! I CAN'T FIND MY WALLET !!!!!! T_T 
... nevermind , I found my wallet XD 
has anyone ever been hit with a realization that they have a family that loves them so much ? ' Cause I've been hit with that just now . Looking through pictures , talking on the phone with my brother , and looking at the drawing I did for < PROPMALE > pretty much influenced that feeling . God , I love my siblings so much , and I love my nieces and nephews just as much too ! ; w ; 
Why is it so COLD in the house ?! My hot cocoa is cold again ; w ; 
Going to sleep ! Night fb ! :) 
Cleaning , cleaning , cleaning , cleaning , cleaning , and cleaning . And did I mention cleaning ? XD 
YES !!!! I GOT THE INTERNET BACK ! :D 
I'm not trying to complain , but it feels like everybody is mad at me today/tonight . If I've upset you , I'm sorry , I'm not perfect . I admit I can royally fuck up things , but I can't help it . I'm a human being :( So I'm just gonna sleep on it tonight . I had a fucked day yesterday , and I wanted a good day today . Guess my good day will be tomorrow :( 
Been playing \Robot Unicorn Attack\ " for 3 days . It never gets old for me @_@ " 
I hate it when my mom rags on me to get a job . I fill out job apps all the fucking time and it's still not good enough . Not sure if this counts as a FML moment or not u_u ;;; 
OMG DEVIANTART IS SO EPIC TODAY XDDDDDDD 
Tired as hell u.u ;;;;; Gonna head to bed since I had less than an hour of sleep at least XD So good day everyone :D 
I got a paper cut ! ; w ; 
Over at my aunt < PROPFIRST>'s house for Easter . Haven't seen my cousins in a long time @_@ 
Changed my email address because of stupid spammers using my email to send messages ! :( Making a new one right now ! 
Had a nice day so far , and now things just kinda went downhill . I just feel so down right now ... 
La la la I'm bored and sleepy . Not to mention my face hurts :( 
Cleaning , cleaning , cleaning ! Then I gotta exercise and take a bath before my mom gets home . We're going out to eat tonight :D 
Had a good night tonight hangin ' with my mom :D Now I'm off to sleep off the alcohol in my system . Night facebook peeps ! :) 
I feel so fucking hurt and betrayed right now . I don't even know if I can think straight or look at the person I'm mad at without wanting to hit them ! 
Whew ! I'm so glad I don't have to do any taxes , though it makes me feel kinda crappy for not having a job :( Just put my dads W-2 in on turbo tax and that refund crashed FAST ! My heart sank and it's not even MY taxes ! XD 
I've decided to pick up on a new hobby yesterday ! But the only thing is that I gotta learn how to hand-sew first , lol ... 
Yeah , the new hobby/project I said I was going to do , but I gotta learn how to sew first ? I'm going to be making plushies ! :) 
Ha ha ~ < PROPFIRST > Buckley is awesome :) 
I'm sick of trying to make people happy just to fit in . If you don't like the things that I do , the things I say , the family I have , and the things I love to do then you can just FUCK OFF ! I know who my true friends are . 
Just ordered some stuff from a craft store online for my plushies and such . Won't have everything I'll need to get started , but I am stocking up on supplies :) 
Why do I always have to be so impatient when it comes to ordering stuff online and wanting it RIGHT AWAY the next day ? XD Maybe I should do sewing experiments or something to keep my mind occupied ... 
I fucking hate it when someone blames you for some shit you didnt even do . Thats what I'm dealing with now :/ 
Despite a few bad things , today was AN AWESOME DAY ! We had a small party for my niece , < PROPFEMALE > , today at < PROPMALE > E Cheese's :D I'll upload some pics & vids tomorrow . But we're going back Saturday and I hope < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo will be able to come with the boys ! And I got my package today ! YEAH !!! 
Here I am trying to go to sleep early and after 1 1/2 hours I can't sleep :/ 
Still not asleep x_x If I can't sleep then I'll just sew ... 
I got the worst sleep EVER today x_x ;;;;; I think I FINALLY got to sleep at 9:30 this morning and woke up at 1pm ... and it's 1:38 now x_x ;;;;;; 
I cleaned the whole house from 2pm all the way to now , 5:14 pm x_x ;;;;; It was rough , but I got it all done . Now I can get paid @_@ ;;;; 
Had another sleepless night , but now I'm at < PROPMALE > E Cheese's with my nieces and nephew . Just waitin for my sis and the boys :) 
http://twitpic.com/1i4n2q - 
At my bro's house ... and wondering when we're going home so I can attempt to sleep @_@ ;;;; Well , I'm going to take half a sleeping pill so hopefully that'll knock me out XD 
Going to sleep !!! I pray it'll be more than 3 hours ! 
Missed 3 weeks of church this month . I fail :| 
I ? LadyGaga I ? LadyGaga I ? LadyGaga I ? LadyGaga I ? LadyGaga I ? LadyGaga I ? LadyGaga ' cause it's true ! ;) 
I ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGagaI ? LadyGaga 
Been feeling sick to my stomach all day :'( And also I had a dream that I jumped out of a building o_O Suicide ? I don't know . But I might've been playing Fire Escape too much on the HTF site XD ; 
Just had a dream that I was robbing a bank with my friend < PROPMALE > and a bunch of celebs o_O Really weird if you ask me XD 
Tired as HELL ! Gonna sleep now ;) 
If there was som random piece of clothing or fabric of some type that looked like it fell out of a tree or was just dirty and was on your car , would you touch it with BARE hands ? I just dealt with that now and my mom thinks I was being a baby about it :| 
I have a massive headache x_x ;;; 
I'm so bored and irritated :( Gonna play some \Fire Escape\ " on the HTF site so I can enjoy saving and letting victims splat XD ;;;" 
I got to check my weight today since my mom had to go to the docs . I lost 8 pounds ! :D 
Why does my face hurt ?! x_x ;;;;;;;;;;;; 
Don't want to freak myself out or anything , so I need to be calm . But I've had a tight feeling in my throat all day yesterday and It seems worse-like :( I hope I don't die tonight :'( 
Feeling semi okay today . Still have the choking feeling , though :( 
At < PROPMALE>'s Cafe with my mom , aunt < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > . Havin ' a good night :) 
Gawd my mom is wasted -_- 
Gettin ' ready to go out again tonight . Gonna be heading to Armandos so we can eat and drink all night xD I just pray it won't be last nights disaster -_-;;;

Brawl all night , sleep all day . I like the sound of it . But it's not my exact plans for the night . I was depressed today so I'm working on a drawing as well as listening to \Dreams\ " by < PROPFIRST > Halen . I'll have the pic up soon :) " 
Watching old wrestling matches from the Attitude < PROPFEMALE > on Youtube . I miss the good old days . Stone Cold was always the best ! <3 Btw ... watching The Rock vs . Stone Cold , WrestleMania 17 :)

I honestly thought my mom would be happy that I told her that I had a job opportunity waiting for me once I've volunteered and shit . But I guess it's not enough . I have to STAY home and work some place CLOSE to hom instead of fucking going out into the world . I'm SICK and TIRED of her mentioning FAMILY DOLLAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm very upset at the moment :'( 
completed her food and exercise diary for 05/05/2010 and was under her calorie goal #myfitnesspal

Where did daddy go ? Last time I saw him was Tuesday night , since I slept almost all day Wednesday . He's not home and I'm worried . I hope he's okay , even if he does make me mad at time :'( 
Daddy's fine ! He just got home about a half hour ago . I don't want to explain the whole situation that happened . We're keeping it to ourselves ^^ ; 
I can't wait until Mother's Day . My mom and I are gonna go to church , then go eat afterwards , and I don't know WHAT else after that ! :) 
Out at Sams Club right now . Grabbin ' a bite to eat before we shop x_x 
Bought my mom a beautiful card and some roses . Her reaction - Totally worth more than anything in the world :') 
Had an excellent day at church today ! My mom enjoyed herself this morning and I'm so glad . I can't wait until my baptism ! 
Argh ! Why can't Youmacon get here faster ?! :'( 
Not feelin ' too good tonight . Sick to my stomach . Hopefully sleep will help :( Night ya'll . 
If I said I was moving to Reno , NV what would you think ? 
Finally going to sleep ! I gotta quit goig to bed do late x_x 
Just found out we might take a family vacation to < PROPMALE > City ! Sounds AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!! @______@ 
Gah ! Gotta get to bed early ! >:( Long story and I don't feel like explaining . I'm really hoping for the summer family vacation to < PROPMALE > City ! * crosses fingers * 
It sucks when you get a second opinion from a friend about something and then shit hits the fucking fan when you go with what they said :| 
Feeling so much friggin ' better right now ! Very relieved . I'm not sick anymore :D 
I'm gonna try my damn hardest to not let the little shit bother me . I'm tired of people trying to bring me down . FUCK ALL YALL HATERS !!!!!! :D 
Let me correct myself on what I said in my tweet . I have pharyngitis , and it sucks ! :| Thankfully I got some cough drops , vapor rub , and some tea I can't spell the name of help me out . As well as soup and soda crackers :D 
Still feeling like ultimate crap and I fail at spelling and typing ! Yaaaaay ! :D Gonna get off here and watch tv while eating soup and drinking tea . And I nearly typed \dreanking\ " XD " 
I'm still having trouble with my bowels -_-;;;; Might have internal hemorrhoids or something . Trying not to worry about it , since I'm now writing a daily journal to calm myself down . I just kinda wish this bullshit would pass so I can go normally :/ 
My one tooth that was already in half cracked in half after eating cold pizza :| This shit sucks ... 
Been starting to feel a lot better lately . My throat is still kinda bothering me , but other than that I'm fine ! Writing a daily journal has been helping me greatly ! I should have started this journal thing sooner ! :) 
Barely got sleep and feel like shit . Gonna catch the rest of my Z's now ! :) 
Argh , burned my fucking finger on the damn < PROPFIRST > Foreman grill ><;;;; Though I soaked it in cool water and banaged it , it hurts like a bitch still x_x ;;;; 
I wish I could see Hawthorne Heights on June 2nd , but I doubt I'd be able to go see them ;_; 
I HATE FEELING ULTRA SHITTY !!!!!!! Really panicky right now , but I'm talking to a few friends right now , which is making feel a bit better , as well as crying . I just want to overpower my anxiety :'( 
Argh , having tooth trouble . Sensitive teeth on the upper right side , fucked up tooth on the lower left side . NOT a fun experience while trying to eat :'( 
Can't wait until tomorrow ! Going to a bbq at my uncle < PROPMALE>'s house :D Can't wait to see family there :) 
I hate having difficulty breathing !!!!!! My chest keeps acting up and my breathing feels weird . I hate having these fucking problems <<;;;;;; 
Argh , I hate it when I can't sleep :'( 
Somewhat frustrating day today :( Got yelled at for something I didn't do , but all is good even if there wasn't an apology :) Going to take my frustrations out on dishes and doing laundry and exercising ! And maybe even drawing : ' D 
Had a good workout on the treadmill ! :) Gonna go at it again later once I get all my laundry together . My room is a wreck XD 
Going to be baptized tomorrow :D But now I'm home alone since the folks wanted to go out and my closest friend is away somewhere else for the weekend . Sigh , being lonely stinks :( 
Will hopefully be able to make it to church ! Unless the stupid streets by my house are too flooded ! ARGH ! >:( 
Didn't write sooner , but I ended up getting baptized . It was a very nervous and mostly emotional moment for me in my entire life . I don't think I've ever made a huge commitment like this :o After baptism I felt so pure and cleansed , that made me want to cry even more , but from happiness :') 
Is it strange that I love watching vlogs of an awesome family ( SHAYTARDS ) on YouTube , stalk the Ustream for there to be a live recording tonight , and frantically grabbing my phone to see if the twitter updates I get are from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? I don't believe so :) 
Anxiously waiting on Ustream for < PROPFEMALE > to go live from the hospital . It'll still be a few hours before anything happens . Still , so damn excited that the baby is finally going to be coming ! :D 
Has anyone ever had a really bad dream and they woke up right away from it and then go back to sleep and the dream almost kinda REPEATS itself ?! I just went through that this morning >:( My dreams are getting worse lately ... 
Ha ha ha ~ Having an awesome convo with Nneka < PROPFEMALE > Burns about random stuff XD 
Cooking up some brunch for my mom and I ! Hashbrowns , bacon and eggs ! Yum ! :D 
Can't read my , can't read my , no you can't read my Pervy Face ! ... oh wait , yeah you can D: 
Working on an awesome drawing thanks to an awesome movie from my childhood ! :D 
Still working on a drawing that is taking FOREVER !!!! Which honestly I think it's a good change of pace , rather than me working on it for less than an hour and it comes out like crap . Hurrah for taking my time ! :D 
Going to play some Wii Sports ! Boxing is my ultimate favorite ! :D 
wishes she could go to < PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE>'s FRIDAY BITCHES BALL with PMS & Switchfoot ! :( BUT I DON'T HAVE A RIDE TO GO , ARGH !!!!

Didn't get to go to Livonia Spree due to the weather :( But at least I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with my family for lunch at < PROPFEMALE > Corral ! :D 
Aiming to win a Macbook Pro with SoBe Lifewater's \Heads or Tails\ " contest ! I gotta buy more Sobe ! :D " 
Working on < PROPMALE > requests/trades for friends on deviantArt ! It's about time I got st < PROPMALE > ed on them :D 
Saw two cute < PROPFEMALE > little spiders on my laptop earlier . Wondered where they came from and I looked up ... and saw like an infestation of < PROPFEMALE > spiders ! x_x ;;;;; So , as much as I didn't want to , I had to vacuum all those little spiders up along with cobwebs in the corners . I have NO idea where they came from , or where the sac of eggs they came from were @_@ ;;; 
UGH !!!!!!!!!!! I found MORE baby spiders on my ceiling even after I vacuumed them up this morning !!!!! I can't even relax in my own damn room :'( 
I need more zoo-mates ! :) 
Sigh ... I wish the people that owed me money would GIVE me the money instead of putting it off . I mean , I know the economy is bad and all , but I need money too . I've tried getting a job and of course I don't get shit . Feeling like a sack of crap at the moment and going to drown my sorrow into cleaning ... 
OMG !!! I cannot wait until next year !!!! Anime Expo® 2011 , HERE I COME !!!!!!!!!! I am going to find things to do that will get me money and I will be there next year for SURE !!!!! 
Just bought my pass for Anime Expo® 2011 !!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR !!!!! 
Working on a secret project !!!!! Can't tell anyone , especially the person I'm making the \surprise\ " for > w >;;;; ... in otherwords I'll eventually talk about it XD ; " 
Ugh !!! THIS HEAT SUCKS !!!!! >_<;;; 
Okay ... WTH weather ... first you're hot and humid as hell ... AND NOW YOU RAIN ?! UGH !!! Don't affect my A/C is all I can say , it can still be hot in my room <_<;;; 
Ugh , I hate acid reflux >_<;;; 
Ha ha ~ I love keeping people in suspense . I got a friend who is dying to know what our \secret cosplays\ " for AX next year will be . And I've got a secret project I'm working on for another friend that I'll give to them once I go to AX next year ! :D Plus they have no idea I'm working on something for them XD " 
Argh , I've got a kink in my neck > _o Total pain in the rear if you ask me -_-;;; 
Not feeling too good tonight . Got a fever of 99.4 and feeling rather shitty . I hope I'll get better and that it's not anything worse :( 
Ugh , why is tonight so hot in the damn house ? D:< Going to my room to chill out , so I don't have my temp going up again <_<;;; So goodnight FB friends and fam ! :D 
OMG I MIGHT HAVE AN INTERVIEW TODAY ASLDKFJASLKDFJWSODFJWOIFJWLKEFJJSLKDFJ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 
Finding out that I lost 9 pounds today was awesome !!!! I hope my weight loss continues ! :D 
Back home from the drug test . I got out surprisingly fast ! I thought I'd be there for hours , but I wasn't :) It just took FOREVER getting home because of construction crap going on and I nearly got lost , but I DIDN'T!!!!!! Thank you God ! :D 
I dunno what's been wrong with me today . Barely want to eat anything , my mouth was very dry even though I'd be drinking water , and I have an odd pain in my chest . And it can't be diabetes ' cause my blood sugar would be out of control , which it wasn't since it was 96 . Sigh , just gotta keep getting my weight down I guess : < 
Watching ' < PROPFEMALE > Hills Ninja ' with my mom . Frickin ' hilarious !!! XD 
Still struggling with throat problems , but thank God it wasn't as bad as last night ! I honestly thought I would be dead , but I wasn't :') 
wishes she had someone to < PROPFEMALE > out with because staying home all the time isn't doing much good . If I had something to do on a daily basis I don't think I'd have half the problems I got right now -.-;;; 
Argh !!!! I'm tired of my dry mouth/throat !!!! It's pissing me off ! >:( 
Got to < PROPFEMALE > out with my best friend < PROPMALE > Moyer !!!!! He was really a godsend today , I don't think I would be as happy as I am right now ! Plus we're going to see a movie tomorrow . Hell yeah ! >:D 
had a wonderful time with < PROPMALE > Moyer today :) Went to the movies with our yummies and saw How To Train Your Dragon at < PROPFIRST > Park cinemas , went to Southland Mall afterwards and was window shopping at Best Buy and other places . I want an iPad badly now <_<;;;; 
I can't wait until August 13th when The Expendables is out so I can see my favorite smexy wrestler/actor Stone Cold < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > on the screen ! * w * 
I'm home and feeling okay ! Glad I went to the ER , found out I had some problems I didn't even KNOW I had ! Got my meds for my problems so I'll be just fine ! ;D I want to thank my sis < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo for taking me to the hospital . I really appreciate what she did for me ; w ; 
Oh Lord ... going to my first day on the job in less than an hour ! So nervous , yet also happy that I was granted this opportunity ! Thank you God and Jesus ! :) 
First day of work : EXHAUSTING !!!! x_x ;;;;;;;; Even worse : we have to work from 4PM to 1AM x________x ;;;;;;;;;; I wish I had my own car or someone could drop me off since I can't take my mom's car all the time :( 
I'm SO thankful that tomorrow is Friday ! Then I'll be FREE on the weekend !!!!!!!! My feet are so sore and achy :'( 
So glad to finally be home , and be free for the weekend ! My feet are so damn sore and red . I'm gonna rest them this weekend ' cause I'll have to go back to being tortured on Monday :'( 
Ugh , work has totally ruined my sleep schedule x_x ;;;; I can't even wake up in time for church or for anything else ;_; I want Sunday to last forever before going back to being tortured ... 
Had a REALLY strange dream last night that had 3 people I've never met before , but there was a girl who turned into a little toad witch , and two other guys that I can't remember what their powers were D: All I know is that I worked for the FBI and I ended up getting shot ... which the toad witch saved my live :o 
Ugh , only got 4 hours or less of sleep ' cause mom wanted me to go to breakfast with her :/ 
Damn I have never been in so much pain in my life . My spine feels like it severely wants to snap in half , and I'm practically BEGGING my mom to cut my feet off :'( Worked our asses off tonight and got forced to make one more palette <_< But I guess the good news was that we didn't have to clean XD 
Friday !!!!! I'm so glad that it is Friday ' cause now I'll be able to rest for the weekend ! My body is so achy and sore . But it'll be worth it when I get that paycheck . And speaking of pay checks , we get one today ;) 
Just bought New Super < PROPFIRST > Bros . Wii today while out with my gay husband <3 We had a blast and saw Cats and Dogs : The Revenge of < PROPFEMALE > Galore . Tomorrow we're going to discuss ideas on my YouTube video entry for < PROPFEMALE > Soul's Who's Next contest . I really hope to be the next internet < PROPFEMALE > . It's been a dream of mine since I discovered my favorite YouTubers ! :) 
Had a good time out with family , now I'm just relaxing playing my new game :) Just gotta ask my mom if I can borrow the car tomorrow and then keep brainstorming ideas for the video that I'll be making with my gay husband < PROPMALE > Moyer <3 
I really don't like it when I end up getting acid reflux . I was up half the night because of that BS -_-;;; 
Called off work ' cause my stomach wasn't acting right . It'd suck to keep running off the line every 5 minutes to use the bathroom x_x 
Just woke up with only a couple of hours until I go to work . I wish it wasn't so torturous ;_; 
So we'll pretend it's alright ( pretend it's alright ) , and we'll stay inside . Oh what a world , I'll keep you safe here with me ( with me) ! ;D 
I woke up early as hell this morning thanks to playing something that had a lot of censoring beeps . I ended up dreaming someone was bitching me out before I woke up . Only a couple hours until work ;_; 
Yeah , didn't have to go into work today ! :D 
Damn we gotta work ! ; A ; 
is so glad it's the weekend !!!!! We got new liquor to pack on our line now . I don't know how many palettes we have to make a day , since today was our first day packing the new liquor . I just HOPE a certain bitch doesn't speed the line up like crazy and mess us all up ! Grr ! And I'm seeing weight loss progress , I just need a darn scale ! >:( 
Number one main focus today : Spend time with Gay Husband <3 Main focus number two : CLEAN MY ROOM XD 
About to head to work soon . I'll finally be able to put last week's check in the bank tomorrow ! ;D 
I ended up weighing myself and I went from 352 ( 7/13/10 ) to 335 ( today ) o_o * faints * 
Saw The Expendables with my mom earlier . BEST . MOVIE . EVER . <3 
Had a weird ass dream that I was pregnant o_O I mean , I'm happy for all my HS buddies having kids and stuff , but that's just not for me right now . I want to enjoy my life before I get tied down with marriage and kids :) 
Got an hour until my ride gets here , and an hour & 45 minutes until we work to death x_x ;;;; 
Yesterday was the BEST day of work ever . < PROPMALE > Moyer was temporarily laid off from his one job he's working at and he had to be over at my job , except he was on the other line instead of on mine ! :( But he came over to talk to me on his break , and it was awesome ! <3 And even better when we took a long ride home , which was full of hilarity and awesomeness ! Too bad he's not going in today because of his asthma :( 
Got my eyebrows done today before I went to work . They were getting out of control ! And I found out that our last week to work is the 2nd week in September . I know I shouldn't be happy , but I am ' cause I'll finally get out of that hell hole ! XD 
Still sore as hell from working overtime on the first line last night . That'll be the first AND last time I do that . Gotta wash up and go get my nephew a gift for his birthday ~ 
Just had a rude awakening this morning because of my mom . Apparently she can't get her own shit together -_-;;; Trying to get back to sleep now before I have to be in to work later and my ride picks me up ... 
Ugh , I ended up getting a head cold . It sucks =3 =;;;; 
is so damn happy to have a 3 day weekend ! Even if we don't get paid for Monday , ROFL ! XD 
is having a good old time playing some old school < PROPFIRST > and drinking some Smirnoff . What a way to spend my 3-day weekend XD 
I don't know why , but I found it kinda funny that I ran into my sister < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo at Sams Club earlier today . I did think that would happen one day , but didn't expect it today XD 
had some fun playing Super < PROPFIRST > Bros . Wii with < PROPMALE > Moyer ! Epic and funny as hell , especially since we were doing voices for < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > XD Fun times ! <3 
isn't sure if the Mexicans next door are bbqing or trying to set their house on fire >>;;;;; 
Hey FB friends and family . Could I ask you all a favor and to pray for my uncle please ? He's been in the hospital since Wednesday and we're not sure what he has in his brain , but it's some sort of mass . We're hoping it's not a tumor . So please pray that it's nothing too serious and that it can just be taken care of with medicine . :( Thanks and I love you guys ! <3 
Didn't have to go into work today . And since I didn't have to go in I went out with my most awesome friend < PROPMALE > Moyer ! And I * cannot * wait until next month ! Youmacon get here sooner please ! : ' D 
wonders if she's the only one that has no luck at all with love <_< 
Today ( Thursday ) was our very last day of work . I'm officially laid off and unemployed . Firetruck D:< 
thinks it feels weird to be laid off . I have a lot of free time again , and I'm afraid I might turn back into a lazy bum again X'D Time to start puttin ' in job apps and get to cleaning the house ! ' Cause I still need money for Youmacon ! 
Just saw the trailer for Disgaea 4 . I . Fucking . Want . <3 
just woke up . Damn I'm exhausted still from not really getting ANY good sleep recently x_x ; 
went to see my uncle today at his house and glad to hear he's doing better ! :) He won't start chemo & radiation until next week . I just hope it'll take care of the problem and all will be good <3 
Argh , I'm so sleepy today ! :( 
has been feeling lonely and depressed lately . Will I ever find someone to love me for who I am instead of judging by looks ? 
In Indy right now about to see UFC : Ultimate Fighting Championship 119 LIVE ! A cab is about to get us and we're going to have us some fun ! XD 
Agh ! I'm so hungry that my stomach hurts and I feel sick ><;;; Has anybody felt like this before ? I know a couple people do :o Can't have cereal ' cause for SOME reason when we got home yesterday most of the food was SPOILED in the fridge , and it was all FINE on Saturday <_< 
Somehow ended up getting sick yesterday , and it's definitely kicking my ass today -_- I need some OJ <_< 
Caramel apples are yummeh ! <3 And I want to go to a haunted house this month !!!! 
FREEZING !!!!!!!!!! ; A ; 
I miss my dad , I wonder where he's been all these years ? And who is the strange man that now lives in our basement ?

I wanna carve a pumpkin damn it ! D:< 
I have internet again ! But that's not important ! WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT YOUMACON IS ALMOST LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY !!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
Went out with mom and had us some margaritas xD 
I can't remember a damn thing I did last night . Not to mention I feel like shit x_x ; 
I strongly dislike the sound of someone puking . My poor friend is doing that in the bathroom and I can't help but cringe and feel sorry :'( 
Will I ever get over minor little colds ? Thanks to this shit I can't even get my flu shot -_-; And my friend is still sick , so I had to walk to the dollar store and buy a few things . Came back sweating to death x.x ;;; 
It really irks me when there are people who are fat and then try to talk down to someone who is fat as well . Gawd I'm so irritated at the moment >_< 
is sad that Youmacon is over ; A ; Didn't really get to enjoy it that much because I was unable to get to the panels I wanted to go to , or the one I was * trying * to go to got moved -_- Oh well , I still had fun and enjoyed myself ! <3 I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL YOUMA 2011 ~ ! 8D 
I hate it when the most fragile things fall apart ... 
* sigh * Ended up losing my job T T_T T 
Post-con depression sucks ; A ; And in a little bit I'll be having brats over here to watch X'D 
Falling back really helped me out with my sleeping schedule . I now wake up at 11 or sooner instead of noon XD 
Haven't been on FB in a while , nor have I tweeted . Nothing but being busy with things here and there . Hope all my FB friends and family are doing good ! I love you guys ! :D <3 
At the hotel with my cuz and friend . My cousin just showed me something very disgusting x_x ;;; 
Could NOT sleep on the sofa sleeper at all last night . Had a very hard time sleeping as well as being uncomfortable with the room temp , but all is fine now . Everyone else is still sleeping except for me :/ 
Playing some War and heading to bed eventually . Had an awesome Thanksgiving with family and friends yesterday ! I'm so happy everything turned out fabulous even if a certain basement dweller did not want to celebrate with us . I just want to be happy with my family :) 
I feel like absolute shit . I wish I could go off on vacation somewhere alone . 
So many things I wish I could say on here , but it's best to be kept to myself so I don't get myself into trouble <.<; 
People can say the cruelest things to you . And it hurts even more when it comes from someone you think is your family . And < PROPFEMALE > Salcedo , you know exactly who I'm talking about :( 
Gonna play a little bit more War since my < PROPMALE > might be leaving me soon ; A ; And then I'll have to be on a hunt for some N64 AV cables of my own ! Agh ! 
He has a TV down in the basement , yet he's up here watching TV in the living room -_-; 
Sorry if anybody's been trying to get a hold of me on my cell and I haven't been able to call back or whatever . It's still out of service at the moment . I'll get back to tweeting and doing status updates from my phone eventually ! <3 
I swear the psychos are out tonight ! There was about to be a fight at Armandos . It was crazy ! D: 
Had a dream that made me burst into tears all day today . I miss you grandpa and I'll always love you with all of my heart ! <3 
I've changed my weight goal to 160 . I'm hoping to be in shape eventually so I can get into the Air Force . Sounds crazy for me to do , right ? But I want to protect my country :) 
If anybody wants to know ... ketchup to the eye hurts ... BADLY x_x 
Wishing for some happiness to come my way . I wish I had a soul mate :'( 
It's almost midnight , but I just want to say before its too late : Happy Birthday , Grandpa . This year you probably would've been 73 years old . I hope you had a wonderful birthday up in Heaven . Wish we could've been there to celebrate with ya . Two years is a long time since you've been gone . I miss you , and I love you with all of my heart . 
Just tricked a friend into eating a dog biscuit ! And they liked it ! XD 
Feeling like absolute shit from the lack of sleep I'm getting now . Have a bad headache now ! >_< 
After staying up for more than 24 hours I'm going to FINALLY go to sleep ! NIGHT !!!!!! 
is feeling like miserable shit . Been crying since I woke up . 
Watching music vids and Christmas specials . Still lonely :( 
Eating at < PROPMALE > Village with my folks :) 
Okay , I've got a serious question to ask and I need everybody to try and respond . Is it a good idea for someone like me with very little job experience to try and call employers after filling out an application vs . someone who has a lot more experience to do the same thing ? I'm always badgered to fill out apps and call the very next day and I need advice from those of you that have/used to have jobs . Thank you ! 
Saw Tangled with < PROPMALE > Moyer yesterday . It was a really good movie ! Worth seeing again ! :D 
Been busy all day today ! And my sleep keeps getting interrupted because I keep waking up in the middle of the night ! Argh ! Ah well , I managed to get my PS3 today ! But I can't have it until Christmas ! I miss < PROPFEMALE > Pierce :'( 
Trying to get the house cleaned for Saturday ! Mainly so I don't have to work on my birthday >:( 
Had a somewhat fabulous birthday yesterday . Again , thanks you guys who wished me happy birthday :) About to go out shopping to get a gift for my momma <3 I will destroy whoever tries to ruin my day XD 
Tried looking for my grandpa's grave for an hour . No luck at all :'( 
Wooooo ! I'm on my itouch ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !!!!!!!
