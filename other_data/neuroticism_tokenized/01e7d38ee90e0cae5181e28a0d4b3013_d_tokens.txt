\There is where you want to be . But you can't get there from here . \"" 
Two hour wait at the rmv .... two more hours gone .... sigh 
Trying to talk less in an attempt to hear more . 
You can try to be everything to everyone ... or you can be everything for only one ... 
It's a beautiful Monday ... only a few more weeks until summer :) 
Please put this on your status if you know someone(or are related to someone ) who was killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > .

Our father who < PROPMALE > in Boston . Hockey be thy name . Thy will be done . The cup will be won . On ice , as well as in the stands . Give us this day our hockey sticks .

My super smart 5 year old scientist asked this question ... http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question38.html 
My home is being destroyed by BP !!! The beautiful white < PROPFIRST > beaches of my home Florida are being coated with oil ... small balls right now ... I'm crying 
http://tweetmeme.com/story/695646009/welcome-to-the-better-marriage-blanket\ 
OMG can you believe this ?! I have been dreaming of this forever ! 
I'm tired of it !!! The well should have been destroyed within the first week ... but no not even within the first month ! And why hasn't it been destroyed ??? Because if BP destroys the well they lose the drilling rights to the land , and then must buy a new spot for another well . WTF ?? \ 
JOIN ME ... BOYCOTTBP !!!!! 
Happy Fathers Day to all of you who choose to be a loving father and role model to the children in your lives that look up to you and think of you as a hero ... any man can create a child ... it takes a pure heart full of love to be a father .

Summer is here ! Sitting at a table inside a wonderfully air conditioned Dunkin Donuts talking with my girls about the beach :) .... Were trying out the new coolota flavors ; watermelon and blue raspberry . 
I am in love with middle earth . Having only one life to live I wish to live there . Free of technology and the complications of industrialization . Where wars were faught for truly honorable reasons . Where a man was a man and \family\ " wasn't a chosen \ " lifestyle\ " .... MIDDLE EARTH RULES !!!!! " 
A vacuum that doesn't suck really sucks to use ! ~ Rob J 
I admit I am a geek , while recently obsessing over my farm < PROPFIRST > J said \Your status should be laid off and loving it\ " he is on the right track . I would love it if I could change one thing . If < PROPFIRST > could be with me it would be perfect and I would love it . " 
Please copy and paste this to your status , if you know someone or have been affected by someone who needs a smack upside the head . People who need \ 
a smack upside the head effect the lives of many . There is still no known\ 
cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head except a smack \ 
...... upside the head but we can raise awareness . LOL 
just finished watching a very interesting animated film on netflix called < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . just before the final credits was this reminder ... \God gave us relatives ..... Thank god we can choose our friends\ " I am very glad to have good friends in my life and here on fb . " 
I was just wondering .... When did our country's government stop protecting the people ? When did our government turn on it's people sucking the life out of their lives ? Maybe both things happened at the same time ... 
My moms phone is off for a few days ... I miss her so much I hadn't really realized until now how much her presence means to my life ... I can't wait until I can hear her voice again ... I love my mommy 
I need smokers for my beehive ... please send some if you can .... thanks 
I just realized something interesting ... I was outside of the box before I knew the box existed ... now I'm wondering what that means for me ... what do you think ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Wong : Children with special needs don't have an illness , so they are not contagious . They want what we all want , which is to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . But will you do it and leave it on your status for at least one hour ? It's special education week , and this ... is in honor of all the kids who are in need .

It seems very strange to me that a close confidant of the past would selfishly withhold information from me . I only seek enlightenment so that I may learn and move on . That would end my pain . 
AACCHOO !!!........? (-???•?) ?.. If you're allergic to bullshit , drama , games , liars , & fake ass people keep this sneeze going .... 
I'm so happy that my girls have an awesome step dad :) If you ask them though they'll tell you that they have two dads ... no \step\ " included :) I love you < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > :) " 
is at the laundromat wishing I were anywhere else on this beautiful day :) 
I thank all of my many good fb friends who are my neighbors in various games . You have all helped to make it a fun experience for me . I hope that I have been a good neighbor in return .... I'm going to be playing less for a while to make more time for outdoor summer fun :) 
Here's a thought ... among the many factors that contribute to the deterioration of familys and lovers it is my opinion that heartbreak and greed are the two biggest culprits followed closely by selfishness . 
From the mouth of babes ... my 5 year old just told me \You get what you get and you don't get upset . \"" 
I had a great 17 hours straight with my < PROPFIRST > :) 
I love my husband so very much !!!!!! 
Just got back from jogging ... I can't wait until I can see the pay off of exercise ... it was really hard but being overweigh is even harder for me these days ! 
8:58 pm our kitchen < PROPMALE > says to < PROPFEMALE > \Think about things you don't know ; its the only way your brain is going to work . \"" 
ahhhh ..... peace and serenity at our house and among its members , I am thankful everyday for my three beautiful daughters and my loving and kind friend and husband :) 
PLEASE HELP !!!!!!!!! I only need 4 more bricks to finish my garage !!!! \ 
Please and Thank You :) 
Man is a Religious Animal . He is the only Religious Animal . He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them . He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight .

I thought I'd share this short story , I can across this a few months ago in a forwarded email ... 
The 2010 Perseid meteor shower - August's famous\ 
' shooting stars ' - will peak in this coming week , on the mornings of \ 
August 12 and 13 . 
Maybe the most awesome thing you do with the kids this summer won't cost you a < PROPFEMALE > ....... 
I want to thank ALL of my great friends here on facebook . You are all appreciated !!!!! I have been focusing on finding a better job so I haven't had as much time as usual for being neighborly . I hope everyone is ready to go back to school :) I will miss having so much fun free time with my angels . 
How knave am I ? I just found out that the victim of the \craigslist killer\ " was a prostitute . All this time I thought that she was some young unworldly person . Leave it to irresponsible news broadcasters to demonize a third party in order to fill the nightly news while not even addressing the fact that every person is accountable for there own actions . " 
The darkness surrounds me oppressive and heavy ... I could easily slip to the deepest depths where no one could ever find me ... Robbie is my beacon and he follows me through the ddarkness with his light ... I LOVE YOU ... thank you for always seeking me out .

Her hardest < PROPFEMALE > to hold . \

I loved you the minute I knew I was pregnant . I loved you the minute \ 
you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were\ 
only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , & to this day I \ 
still would ... Put this on your status , if you have a child or \ 
... children ...... you love more than life !! ? I love ALL my children more than life I wonder if they know it . Love you kids , all of you . (

Were traveling on the highway heading to NH for the day . Just saw a bumer sticker worth sharing \Not all who wander are lost \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and Rob ... my four angels of light in them I find the true meaning and purpose for my life ... 
I have been told to shut up and sit down my whole life . I have never committed a crime . I have never knowingly misled anyone for my personal gain or otherwise . I have been a loving wife and mother while being a working tax paying member of society . I was told today that my 5 yr old cannot be enrolled in school this fall . Why you ask ? Because being poor is a crime . 
Heres another thing that just doesn't make sense . A child can legally be denied an education because of a loop hole ..... MY CHILD !!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's getting harder everyday for me to have faith . 
Wow ! I won't be complaining about my cellular service for a while , I cut my friend from 80 to 37 in only 30 < PROPFEMALE > or so which is pretty good considering how complicated that is to do on a blackberry ! Those of you left are here because I choose you and I want to stay your friend . 
I can't sleep ... in a state of utter disbelief 
Our family had a wonderful day and evening together . The girls and I worked as a team during the day completeing the final back to school tasks . And < PROPMALE > and I made a beautiful meal together for all of us . It was a great day of heaven at the Johnson/Dobo house :) 
Getting ready to call it a night . < PROPMALE > and I had a great date day :) Saturdays are quickly becoming my favorite ! 
Happy Happy Happy ! 
We signed the lease for our new place today ! The girls will be starting classes at the new school next Wednesday .... It will be AJ's first day of kindergarten !! We are all so happy and we want to thank our friends and family for giving us the strength and support when we needed it :)

We had soooo much fun today ! A bottle of wine plus unlimited < PROPFEMALE > walk time at the farm equaled happy everyone :)

Life is Good ! 
\What Makes A Man ? \ " \ 
What I am thinking of right now ... \ 
< PROPMALE>'s Third Law of Motion : For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . \ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s thought regarding our individual < PROPFEMALE > : The things beyond our control are affected by the decisions we make everyday . Be careful your paving the way to your < PROPFEMALE > every second of every day . 
I love you Robbie ...... \ 
xoxoxoxoxo from me and our girls 
Everything is unpacked , washed , folded , and put away . I don't have anything to stress about and I have free time .... Yes you read that right nothing to stress about and free time .... So what do I do now ? 
OK so here is what I realty think about god and reality , it's a proven fact that the status quot human only uses 10 % of there brain . With that thought as my basis I believe that everything each person knows or believes is a product of there own minds interpretation . Does god exist ? I really don't know . I think that not knowing is actually the point . We will never know .... until we know . 
Peace and tranquility fill my heart this morning . 
Waiting excitedly for my < PROPFIRST > to come home ! \ 
? I ? miss ? him ? 
< PROPMALE > and I were just talking when the topic of \free will\ " came up . Long story short my first thought was this \ " WOW \ " free will\ " is the ultimate bible disclaimer !!!!!! \"" 
Phrase I despise more than any other ... \Bell to Bell \"" 
I miss my < PROPFIRST > <3 
<3 Yesterday was a great day . I finally got to meet < PROPMALE>'s girls . They are all wonderful beautiful angels . Happy and smart and absolutely precious . I missed them as soon as we left . <3 
Just one more reason why I love you ...... Because you always have a way of making me think ' I never thought of it that way!' ...... Usually I'm thinking that because ' It's the most awesome way to think about that!' ....... just one more reason why ? ? ? ? 
Your killin me right now !!!! You are like the most awesome dad ! 
That's the end of my gushing for now ;-) 
p.s. I've been writing this while you made the most DELICIOUS dinner for the kids and I .

My dad's dog < PROPFEMALE > passed away this past Saturday morning . She was just 8 yrs old . She was a sweet and loving pet who was family to us . She died due to complications from a uterine infection . The vet turned my dad away last Thur because he didn't have $1000 . They agreed to do the surgury for $600 last Fri but they don't work on the weekend . Her appt was on Mon morn . She will be missed greatly . 
I wish you all a happy holiday !!!!! My dad adopted a dog today . She is super cute and healthy just a little over 2 years old . I wish I had a picture to share . He sounded so happy to have found her so soon after losing his pet . I am happy he has a new pet to share his love with :-)

AJ ( my six year old ) was riding in the car .... still in her 5 point harness car seat because she's a < PROPFEMALE > peanut ... when she made this sincerely genuine statement ... \It's a beautiful day today ! \ " ...

Every time my exhusband comes over to visit the kids I am reminded why I got divorced . 
I wish facebook had a blog option . I have many thoughts I'd like to share . Sadly I can't share them here because most of these thoughts and ideas exceed the 420 character maximum allowed in status updates . Does anyone have advice ? Maybe a blog option exists that I am unaware of . Please advise if you can help . 
Great half time show ! Way to go peas !!! 
I'm watching the movie ' Precious ' it's making me cry . If you need some new perspective on life you should check it out .

<3 I joined facebook about 1 year ago . I was excited at first thinking that I could connect with < PROPMALE>'s family and reconnect with my own . Unfortuntely I haven't connected with many of < PROPMALE>'s relatives . In the last week I have found many of my own family members ! I love you all !! I am proud to be a McKean ! <3 
A Woman inhabits her own space fully but doesn't seek to conquer others ' space , any more than she allows others to impose upon her . She competes - passionately - with her eyes on the goal , not with dirty tricks or cheap shots . And when she wins , she is gracious to those who haven't won . 
Here's an interesting fact about me that most people don't know ... I almost always prefer to give my ' turn ' to someone else because I get more joy out of bringing happiness to others than having happiness just for myself . 
God never closes a door in your life without opening another but it can be hell in the hallway ... I am reposting this . My Aunt < PROPFEMALE > posted this today .

When I was a kid I didn't have a computer , cell phone , Nintendo DS , XBox , or Wii . I had a bike , some marbles , and a jump rope .. that was it . If I didn't eat what my Mom made , I didn't eat , and I dealt with it . I didn't think of telling my parents \no\ " or dare to talk back and I got in BIG TROUBLE if I did .... and I survived ! Repost if ... you appreciate the way you were raised . " 
A utility pole near our home was somehow broken in half during the early morning hours . I first noticed that we were without power at around 2am . I saw the new pole being put in at around 10am . Our power was just restored at 11:40 am . It took 9 hours to restore power to our small neighborhood . It is easy to take a convience for granted until it's gone . I am thankful to be able to live in comfort . 
AJ got a red light at school today :( 
We're on our way to visit < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > which is a happiness of it's own <3 The sun is bright and warm :) I am thankful that the weekend hasn't become outdated . It's a perfect day .

My daughter AJ is the one who plays Petville . She really wants some flowers for her pet . I am asking anyone who still plays petville to send some flowers . She needs the to fill her empty vases which will beautify her pets home . Thank You . 
Today was a great day ... read my story below if you're interested :) 
It has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are !! 
Why did Boston < PROPMALE > delete his facebook < PROPFEMALE > ?

I've been lots of places , but I've never been in Cahoots . ( Apparently you can't go alone . - you have to be in Cahoots with someone ) I've also never been in Cognito . ( I hear no one recognizes you there ) . I've never been in Coherent - they say nobody understands you there . I have been in Sane . They don't have an airport , so you have to be driven there . ( For some of us , it's a short drive ) 
Friends are like underwear ... Some crawl up your ass ... Some snap under pressure ... Some don't have the strength to hold you up ... Some get a little twisted ... Some are your favorite ... Some are cheap and just plain nasty ... And some actually do cover your ass when u need them too :-) Re-post for all the friends you have & love ! They know who they are . 
Love is photogenic ... it takes darkness to develop . 
Just had an hour long convo with my brother < PROPFIRST > . OMG he is all grown up ! Married and happier thank I've ever heard him . I even got to hear my nephew make his oh so adorable baby chatter :) sweet dreams for me now .
