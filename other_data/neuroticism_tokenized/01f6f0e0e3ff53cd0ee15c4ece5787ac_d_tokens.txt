Whatever you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will give you a baby . Give her a house , she will give you a home . Give her groceries , she will give you a meal . Give her a smile and she will give you her heart . She multiplies and enlarges what she is given . So if you give her crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit ... Real women keep this going !! :) ~ ?? 
So my cat plays fetch like a dog !! Funny as hell !! she goes and gets the ball then brings it back !! I love it !! ^_^

I have carried a baby in my body . I have comforted a baby on my chest . I have kissed boo boos , been puked & peed on , woke up to a hungry baby & stayed up all night with a sick baby . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror , I see a mother , and there is no greater honor ... or blessing . Make this your status if you are PROUD to be a MOMMY

We crucify ourselves between two things , regret for yesterday and fear for tomorrow . \

I'm not super superstitious , but this year July has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So Copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy ,... will be without money . I can't let that person be ME ! 
I know you believe you understand what you think I said . But I am not sure that you realize that what you heard is not what I meant - < PROPMALE > Greenspan . 
Kickin it with my boys ! <3 Wishin we could freeze time and stay in this moment ... 
Happiness is a choice ! <3 ^_^ 
A great majority of the people that step into my life will never understand me , and those who do mean the world to me . 
HUSBAND WEEK : If you have a husband who is your best friend , who works hard for you , who has been with you through thick and thin , who loves you even when you're at your worst , and whom you are PROUD to be married to , copy and paste this with the date you were married : 2/19/2006

True friends don't care when you're flat broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , whether your hair dye needs a root touch-up , or if your family is filled with nutters . Your conversations always seem to pick up where they left off , even if they're months apart . They love you for exactly who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are . ? 
Whoop Whoop !! Superbowl Sunday !! =) The packers are gonna get stomped !!!! <3 
I love how you make one mistake and say somethin and all of a sudden you're dumb and lame ! Shut the fuck up bitch !! 
A woman has strengths that amaze men\ 
She can handle trouble & < PROPFEMALE > heavy burdens . \ 
She holds hppiness , love , & opinions . \ 
Smiles when she feels like screaming\ 
Sings when she feels like crying , \ 
Cries when she's happy , \ 
& laughs when she's afraid . \ 
Her love is unconditional ! \ 
There's only one thing wrong with her , \ 
She sometimes forgets what she is worth ...
