so i went to work this morning at 9 and was scheduled to get off at 5 but since people decided they didn't want to show up i stayed until 9 its not that i don't mind the hours its just tiring working a 12 hr shift 
before work today i went up to sprint to see about getting a phone with them i was approved and i found out that since i work with whataburger i get a 13% discount on my monthly < PROPMALE > ( cool right ) .... so sine i didn't have the money at the moment to get the phone i want they set me up with a free one for 30 days everything will be unlimited except calls to and from landlines 
i forgot to post this but Orange night out was great last year we gave out 66 burgers so this year corporate was expecting 99 but we blew them out of the water and gave around 299 
I haven't felt this bad in a while now ..... I miss you < PROPFIRST > .

To love is to \ 
suffer . To avoid suffering one must not love . But then one suffers from \ 
not loving . Therefore to love is to suffer , not to love is to suffer . To\ 
suffer is to suffer . To be happy is to love . To be happy then is to \ 
suffer . But suffering makes one unhappy . Therefore , to be unhappy one \ 
must love , or love to suffer , or suffer from too much happiness . I hope \ 
you're getting this down . 
if society could live on love i would be wealthier than all of y'all ........... haha 
Feeling pretty sick up here at work but feeling better than I did when I got here 
bored 
Just had a drunk girl up here that wouldn't stop flirting with me and asking for my #/when I get off work even though I told her I was already in a relationship lol better watch out < PROPFIRST > you've got some competition lol 
Calling out all the Cheaters , Physical/Mental Abusers , and so called PLAYERS out their !! \ 
Im tired of you guys treating women like crap and and making them think they have work for your affection ... \ 
all men should wait on the woman they love and treat them better then they want to be treated because that person should be a blessing to you . \ 
Lets stop this mistreatment and lets stop it now !!!!!! 
suck when you have the night off but nothing to do
