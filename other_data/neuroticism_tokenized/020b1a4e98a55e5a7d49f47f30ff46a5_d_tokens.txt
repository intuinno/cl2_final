just spent about thirty minutes outside talking to Jehovah's Witnesses . about my dog . 

Found a stray dog yesterday ~ She's a beauuutiful little Dachshund ; very sweet and all that . Anybody want another pet ? .. Seriously . 
Just poured half a pot of boiling water on my hand . And may have cracked my favorite Yixing teapot in the process . 
Rolled my ankle pretty badly yesterday while playing tennis . I still can't walk like a normal biped . Thanks , Brian ~ 
Thank you to everybody ! I love all of you ( well , most of you . haha ) and I thank you for all the well-wishes . It's been a somewhat dull day , since I started summer classes . But that's okay ! It's twice as appreciable now that that's over . 
Praying for my grandfather that'll be going into surgery in about 20 minutes . And hoping for the very best . 
Trying to jog in 99 degree weather ? Made it a half a mile , lol . Need just a liiiitle heat relief . 
awww . < PROPFIRST > McCartney on Late Night with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ! He's too cool . 
Heyyy , I haven't been on here in so long , so I thought I'd post something ~ Here it is .
