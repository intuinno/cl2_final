So I just realized that < PROPFEMALE > n currency and the currency in The Legend of < PROPFEMALE > share the same name . Why did this take me so long to figure out ? ( Sadly , < PROPFEMALE>'s currency is not comprised of various colors of hexagonal gemstones . ) 
There are some things man is not meant to see , some movies that are not meant to be made , and some plot summaries that are not meant to be written . I am still shaking after reading it . Don't bother asking me what movie it was ; I don't despise any of you enough to tell you its name . 
( 816 ): Just had a drunken guest at my hotel threaten to \throw a fuckin fireball at my face \"" 
( 513 ): sex in a ball pit . and I thought ghandi did great things . 
No , Facebook , I do not want to be friends with the guy who slapped me my freshman year of high school . How dare you suggest that . 
My life has just been made complete : http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveOfBabies

Ah , wind ; you are exactly what I need to not hate this heat so much . 
( 813 ): Dudeeeee , i ordered strippers for my party . ( 1-813 ): I ordered a moonbounce . ( 813 ): Fuck , you win .

If only I could write my honors thesis about the mathematics behind the various meal plans and the number of points you get for every meal you give up . People may actually be interested in it if I did .

Of all of the dorms to hold a rave in , they're doing it in the Honors dorm ? Ah well , it's at 8:00 PM on Wednesday night if anyone wants to come as my guest . 
It's like that old Scandinavian saying : You can let two angry mackerel fight it out in a purse , but don't ever plan on carrying that purse to a formal affair ... well , it loses a little in the translation . 
has rediscovered the joys of pessimism . Oh how I missed you , old friend . 
In Soviet Russia , status update you ! 
So apparently my tastes in men are so bizarre that I can look at a guy whom three separate close friends have described as ugly and find him very handsome and cute . I am unsure what to think about that ; by that , I mean both the fact that I find a supposedly ugly guy cute and the fact that my friends are willing to say that to my face . 
For far too long , my hair has been devoid of its natural wave at the ends . I don't know what cuased it , but it lay there straight as an arrow , until today , when the wave came back . I don't know how to explain it , but I will say this : the wave is in my hair , and all is right with the world . 
I am < PROPFIRST>'s procrastinating impatience . 
I am < PROPFIRST>'s content resignation . 
I am < PROPFIRST>'s incessant isolation . 
( 240 ): boyfriend # 1 is in the bathroom and boyfriend # 2 is ringing the doorbell need back up this is not a drill i repeat this is not a drill 
is < PROPFIRST>'s inflamed sense of abandonment . 
( 401 ): he said he wanted to butter my pancake . i thought it was sexual , but he went downstairs and made pancakes . i need to stop dating fat guys . 
Sometimes I miss my prepubescent voice ; being mistaken for my father when I pick up the phone is starting to get tiresome .

( 805 ): Going to get yelled at but I labeled the reel \four dried up sluts decide going to the middle east to shop during a war is the best idea ever \"" 
( 847 ): Whoa , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > died\ 
( 224 ): Whatchu talkin bout ?!?! \ 
( 847 ): Too soon . 
The simple act of typing is immensely satisfying compared to scrolling down web pages doing nothing but reading . 
( 815 ): Pretending to be straight requires way more energy than I'm willing to use in this heat . 
Before I go to another party , I need to get a t-shirt with a picture of a sign that says , \Conversation only ; no small talk allowed in this area . \""

I will soon be pruning my friends list to only include people I still talk to or consider worth keeping on the list . If we have actually talked with each other in the last year or we were good friends when we did talk , you won't be pruned . My goal is just to clear people who were acquaintances but nothing more . If you fear being pruned and don't want to be , just say so by commenting on this post . 
As much as it may be typical pop , < PROPFEMALE > Spear's \Toxic\ " actually has a decent bass line . " 
\I am required to award stars to movies I review . This time

\I just moved into my new apartment building . Said building has a library\ 
My friends list has been pruned from 310 people to 152 . I feel so much ... lighter . 
I might be able to take the Twilight movies a bit more seriously if < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Pattinson , or < PROPFIRST > Lautner would just make a different face from the ones they usually make . Every single time I see a promotional image with one of those actors , they each have the same exact facial expression . I know people like familiarity , but come on now ... 
Ok , I have to post both of these :\ 
( 713 ): she gave me a handjob in the middle of the night and my stomach growled so she walked out totally naked and came back 5 minutes later with two sandwiches . who the fuck says getting married is awful ? \ 
( 315 ): She recited Pi throughout every orgasm she had .... she said it was a game she likes to play ... how far she gets is how she judges her lovers ... I am oddly turned on by this ... 
After reading another GMH about people shaving their heads for cancer patients , I feel like I need to say this now : if I ever get cancer and have to go into chemo , please * don't * shave your head for me . The guilt I'll feel at being the reason you shaved your hair will far outweigh any consolation it could give me . 
I know it's disgusting , but it made me laugh : ( 773 ): Its as if he has to do the exact opposite of what I tell him . Don't come in my eye , pfshh it's in my eye . Don't come on the cat , pfshh it's on the cat . 
In other news , after retaking my personality profile test , I can confirm that I am the most introverted of all of my friends who have taken that test . 
This one is for you ; you know who you are : ( 443 ): The irony of calling it Pride is that you do things that no one should be proud of . 
has had various songs off of Megadeth's album Rust In Peace stuck in his head for the past two days . Considering that the songs that get stuck in my head are usually pop garbage , I like this change . 
\No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public . \ " - H.L. Mencken " 
is leaving for Philadalphia to visit his sister for the weekened and won't be back until Sunday . I don't know whether I'll get a < PROPMALE > to check my e-mail at any time through the trip , so if I don't respond to your attempts to contact me during the weekend , that's why . 
( 816 ): She always acts like she's doing me a favor with a hand job . I've been giving myself hand jobs for almost 20 years . 
\Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity ; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger . \ " \ 
To my UML friends ( who are engineers ) , take note : ( 514 ): He was taking the caps off the vodka bottles and throwing them out the window so we'd have to finish them . Engineers have the best logic . 
( 978 ): i know you like preteen girls so i'm gonna offer you some advice ... dump a bucket of glitter on yourself and walk into the sunlight . they will come running .

Nothing against Cyanide & Happiness ( I enjoy it quite a bit ) , but why is Facebook recommending it to be because I liked xkcd ? The two are not at all alike , aside from both being non-story-based webcomics . 
So it turns out \Don't Mess With Texas\ " is an anti-litter slogan . Good to know . ( source : http://dontmesswithtexas.org/report-a-litterer/ ) " 
I should have waited until I was more awake to read this : http://xkcd.com/762/ 
\Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom\ " and \ " The Ultimate Showndown\ " are now on the Rock Band Network . You hear that ? That's the sound of me shrieking in joy . Off to download them . "

( 817 ): They asked me to help them shop for lingerie . \ 
( 214 ): Tell them everything looks awful , makes their ass look fat , etc . You'll wreck their self esteem and likely both have sex with you to make themselves feel better . \ 
( 817 ): You're the most understanding sister I could ever ask for . 
I'M brave enough , that's who . \ 
POKE me if you ever had a crush on me . LIKE this status if you think I'm a good friend . MESSAGE me if you ever wanted a relationship with me . COMMENT if we have good memories . NOW let's see who's brave enough to copy & paste this on their status ...

When someone complained that Blizzard's design of the Maelstrom wasn't epic enough , a representative ensured that in the next patch the \epicness\ " would increase tenfold . This is what they changed it to : http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/8841/258235ffd616edb8cf692d9.jpg\

In the last few very short weeks , the illusions and fantasies that I was raised on have been ripped out violently from under my feet . And I can't complain about it , because such complaints can only be reasonably met with the reply , \That's life . \ " * sigh * This is going to be a rough month . " 
would kill a man to be < PROPFEMALE > ing out with someone tomorrow from 1-4 , and possibly before and/or after , in order to miss a party filled with people who will ask him the same five questions two dozen times . Please , my friends ; throw me a bone and invite me to < PROPFEMALE > out with you tomorrow . 
After listening to some of La Roux's music , I have to say , I'm a bit disappointed . I expected something a bit more unconventional from a band whose singer has hair like that . 
What a sad world we live in where going on someone else's facebook account and writing a status about how they like penis is considered a derogatory act . 
Today I didn't even have to use my A . K . \ 
I got to say it was a good day . \ 
( Of course , hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Lalli certainly didn't hurt either . ) 
(+64 ): I briefly wondered why they weren't in school , but after the tinier one shouted \check out dem titties ! \ " I had my answer " 
WoW.com commenter < PROPFEMALE > perfectly sums up the opinions that World of Warcraft players have on the other faction :\ 
Alliance : \I think we should get along . I have no dislike for you :3 \ " \ 
Allow me to say this now and put it to rest : I don't poke . It goes against one of the ten commandments of facebook ( http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-10-commandments-of-facebook/ ) , and thus I don't do it . If you want to get my attention , write on my wall or send me a private message ; that will be much more appreciated .

Looking at < PROPMALE > Butcher's picture when I log on to facebook is somehow more soothing than looking at my own . 
The Roast of < PROPFIRST > Hasselhoff and the possibility of a good friend coming over tonight is scant but still appreciated consolation for not being in < PROPMALE > while Megadeth/Slayer/Testament play at the Tsongas . 
Sadly , the rest of tonight's roast will be a sore disappointment , because < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > just did his routine in nothing but a speedo and a leather jacket . Thank you , Mr. < PROPMALE > ; thank you kindly . 
Socrates was weary of the written word because it froze ideas in time , making one unable to interact with them as one could with dialog . Something tells me he would have loved wikis .

Will be doing another culling of his friends list some time soon ; there were some people who were on the threshold who I really should have just cut last time . Again , if you fear being cut , just let me know that you want to stay on the list and I will oblige . If we have actually communicated in the past few months or talked in person in the last year , you are safe . 
finally got the bright idea to use Audio Hijack Pro to re-record his songs through iTunes and turn them into clean files . So long , DRMs !

A Tokio Hotel song just spoke to me . Either we need to give that band way more credit , or my life has hit a new low . All things considered , I find the former more likely . 
The first song to reach 100 plays on my new laptop : a song by an obscure Hungarian black metal band . Go figure . \

Times like these make me hope that the rules are reversed for gay men , and that every gay man grows up to marry his own father , not mother . Because as awesome as my mother is , her ENFP tendancies are really getting on my nerves . 
\When you move out I'm getting two Weimaraners ! \ " \ " WHOA DREAM BIG ! \"" 
Allow me to say this now so I don't regret leaving it out later : though I now have my license , I do not have a car of my own , and don't plan to get one for some time , so I cannot drive anyone anywhere . If I'm lucky , I can drive somewhere from Nahant in one of my parent's cars when I'm at home , but that's it .

Can anyone recommend some earbud headphones that have decent sound quality ( i.e. better than the ones that come with an iPod ) and are reliable ?

Thanks to < PROPFIRST > Winczewski , I can't stop listening to Shinedown's \Devour\ " . And I don't mind that fact . " 
( 631 ): He kept buying me shots of < PROPFEMALE > . I decided to just save myself the half hour of toilet hugging and tell him straight up that I intended on sleeping with him . We got Tacos on the way home with all the money we saved . 
New guilty pleasure : listening to BrokenCYDE solely for how unintentionally funny it is . I don't know how my attitude towards them could have changed so much , but I find them downright hilarious now . 
( 303 ): so , I mean this in the straightest way possible , but don't you ever just feel like you owe < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > a blowjob ... 
Today was the first day a man ever told me he liked my hair . Unfortunately , he was kind of out of my league ; he was about 10 .

Candlelight Vigil is tonight at 7 P.M. in the Donahue Quad . Come join us as we remember < PROPFIRST > Shepard and all the recent lives lost due to anti-gay bullying and harassment , and to show that we believe that bullying , harassment , and discrimination is purely unacceptable and wrong . ( Copied from our president's status update ) 
Sunday , the twenty fourth of this month , is a once in a lifetime opportunity : the Westboro Baptist Church is coming to < PROPMALE > to protest UML's production of The Laramie Project from 1:15 to 2:00 . If you have ever wanted an opportunity to be part of a counter-rally against these lunatics , now is your < PROPMALE > . If you are seriously interested , let me know and I'll keep you updated . 
\I can't believe how normal you are . \ " \ 
I'm bored , yada yada yada , let's get on with this . \ 
Like this status and I'll tell you : 1 . Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . The color you remind me of . 3 . My first memory of you ( if I can remember it ) 4 . My fondest memory of you . 5 . The animal you remind me of . 6 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . 7 . My favorite thing about you . 8 . Challenge you to post this . 
So My Top Fans won't publish my results , but here's what I got as people who interact with me the most on facebook . \

Ah , marathon runners ; is there no greater example of self-centered exhibitionism ? 
My laptop is having bad start-up issues right now , so it'll probably be out of commision for a few days . I can check my e-mail on my iPod in the mean time and will probably make liberal use of the library's computers , but until further notice , phone based communication will be preferred . My number is 978 223 5663 . 
To avoid possible disappointment , I'm going to limit myself to cautious optimism and simply tell you that my laptop actually turned on . I'll give it a week before I say it's working dependably again . 
Bad news : My laptop is still out of commission . Good news : This whole saga has been a blessing in disguise in a surprising number of ways . News that concerns you : The best way to reach me is still my cell phone , 978 223 5663 . 
\Why am I fighting to live 
As copied and pasted as they may be , seeing the status posted by my straight friends about their wish for 2010 has really warmed my heart . < PROPFIRST > Keaney ? < PROPFIRST > Beauvais ? < PROPMALE > Faler ? Thank you . 
I can't take my computer in to be fixed until Saturday now , so until then , the best way to reach me is still my cell : 978 223 5663 . In other news , this week has been going so badly it's starting to verge on being comical . 
My laptop was repaired , though at the expense of my harddrive . Now beings the process of bringing my laptop back to where it was before . This is going to be a long week . 
Tomorrow at 1:00 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Cook and I will wave signs proclaiming \God hates bags\ " and \ " All bags go to hell\ " at the counter-WBC protest to show the WBC that we don't take them seriously and to distract attention away from them though the absurdity of our antics . Anyone interested in joining should meet us in the second floor of McGauvran\ 
Only here could you have a crowd of a hundred GLBT-people and allies be vocally disappointed when the Westboro Baptist Church doesn't show up to protest a play we are putting on . But seriously , we put so much time into organizing this counter-protest . They are so inconsiderate .

I should have been thinking about Calculus , but for the past hour , I have been thinking about nothing but the logistics of building a volcano in the middle of the lake next to my house in Minecraft . This game is going to be the end of me . 
Like this status , if you dare , and I will tell you my favorite thing about you and my least favorite thing about you . Before you click that button , know that I am a brutally honest person , and you might not like what you hear ; if you do like this status , and I know you well enough to know your flaws , then brace yourself . 
( 516 ): There are going to be so many Snookis this Halloween that I might just dress as the guy that hit her and punch them all in the face 
So this is what friendship really is . There's no worrying about being even with the other person , about doing the other person a favor for every favor he does for you ; you just do things when the other person asks , because you're happy to do it for them , and they do likewise for the same reason . I have to say , you neurotypicals have a nice thing going on here . 
The last movie I saw in theaters was Saw < PROPFEMALE > , about a year ago . Now I'm going to change that by seeing Saw < PROPFEMALE > I tomorrow . I already have my ticket reserved . It's going to be a good time . 
leaves to see Saw VII in five minutes and just came back from the mail room with Rock Band 3 and the new keyboard controller . It's going to be a good weekend . Productive ? Probably not . Good ? Without a doubt . 
just beat Llama , Rock Band 3's fourth hardest song on the keys , on expert keyboard . The first time I tried the keyboard was four hours ago . I've played the keyboard for maybe an hour total in those four hours . It's official : the keyboard is the new easy instrument . 
I must be the only non-drinking college student in < PROPFEMALE > . 
I have been in the mood for metal music as of late , but the metal selection on my iPod is decidedly lacking . I am calling upon the power of Facebook to summon friends to recommend metal songs for me . They can be any sub-genre , though I generally prefer bands whose vocalist sounds human . With that as your guideline , your challenge is set . 
is reading < PROPMALE > Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for his college literature-class . This is a win .

Voted by absentee ballot about a week ago . It was kind of exciting . 
Look , Willy : < PROPFEMALE>'s got claws ! 
My hobby : chea -- er , being resourceful at online chemistry homework by using Google to look up information that we are supposed to calculate ourselves . 
Fuck man , I have no Idea what to put here . - < PROPFIRST > Winczewski 
Is doing surprisingly well for only getting three hours of sleep last night . Oh , did I mention I stayed up until 4:30 last night ? Yep , pushed the record forward by three and a half hours . It was a good night . 
Is about to watch < PROPMALE > Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for one of his classes . Yes , you read that right , it's for a class . This is a great way to end an already amazing weekend . 
Funny ; last time I took this test , I was the \Innocent Uke\ " . That means that in the past two months 
All of the cool kids at UML are going to give blood today .

\It doesn't feel good if you just squeeze it . You have to go downward . \ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Schneiderman : \I must admit 
I'm heading out to Swampscott for the night , as well as much of tomorrow , to visit a good friend . I don't know whether I'll be able to check my e-mail in that time , so calling me will be your best bet if you need to reach me for any reason . 
Alright , this is a matter of some urgency : does anyone know where I can get a pair of the classic red-and-blue 3D glasses ? 
3D glasses are in the mail . I will soon be playing Minecraft in 3D . This . Is . Going . To . Be . Epic ! 
Alright , new musical mood today : I am in need of recommendations of good death metal songs . Here are songs I have liked to give you an idea of my tastes :\

Friends , countrymen and women , it has come to my attention that some people seem to think that punctuation in text messages is only for the purpose of making smiley faces . This is not the case . A period < PROPFIRST > s the end of a sentence , a comma < PROPFIRST > s a pause in thought , an exclamation < PROPFIRST > denotes emphasis , etc . Please use these symbols for what they were intended for . 
Sometimes I wanna copy somone's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
( Fine , I'll play along . ) You and I wake up in bed together ; using only FOUR words , what would you say to me ? ( Note : if you comment , you have to copy and paste this in your status -- fair is fair . Play along ) 
No sound is scarier than this one :\

< PROPFIRST > Winczewski , < PROPMALE > Perez-Clancy , and < PROPMALE > DeCourcy ( I think ; forgive me if I'm wrong ) know what I'm talking about . 
Thanks to one paper I had to write for chemistry , OpenOffice will now automatically suggest \hermaphroditic\ " any time I type \ " her\ " in a word document . It will do this for the rest of its time on my laptop . Fantastic ... " 
My cell phone knows the word \oni\ " but not \ " eggnog\ " ? < PROPFEMALE > WTF . " 
You know shit's about to get real when < PROPFIRST > Welsh swears . 
I want to put something profound or poetic here , but all I can think of is , \You never go ass to mouth . \"" 
Calling all freeware-philes ! Can anyone recommend a good free Mac-compatible image-editing software like photoshop ? 
Can anyone recommend for me a specific model of headphones that has good quality , is durable , and doesn't create much noise that doesn't end up in my ear ? I'm looking for headphones for the express purpose of listening to loud music without bothering the other people in the room . Size isn't an issue . 
\Don't walk in front of me ; I may not follow . Don't walk behind me ; I may not lead . Just go stand over there somewhere . \ " \ 
If you think I'm visually unappealing , like this status . If you dislike me as a person , put a ?. If you're my mortal enemy , put a :) . If you have ever wanted to fight me , poke me . If you have un-aired grievances with me , message me with them . If you're not scared , post this as your status ! ( A new twist on an old classic ! ) 
Read and learn , people :\

is bored . Let's play the number game . Send me a private message with a number and I will put what I think of you as my status , preceded by the number you send me . 
49.7 : You are without a doubt one of the most entertaining people I know , and I enjoy your company thoroughly , but sometimes I can't help but wonder whether there's something lurking beneath that exterior , something you really don't want others to see . 
42 : This is probably the most sincere one I will write ; I hope that sincerity doesn't scare you away . Here it goes : you are one of the best things that has ever happened to me , period . I am thankful for every moment we have been able to spend together , every word we have exchanged over the phone , everything you have brought into my life . 
113 : I wish we could see each other more often . You're one of the most amiable people I know . 
150 : I wish we knew each other better ; you're too cool to only know casually . 
3 : You're one of the very few people I met in high school that I still consider one of my best friends ; I think that is sufficient to show how magnificent you are as a person . The amount of time it has been since we last saw each other is simply inexcusable ; we must < PROPFEMALE > out over winter break . 
This demonstrates much of what I think is wrong with the world :\

82.4 : What can I say that hasn't been said before ? More importantly , how can I say what remains to be said in a mere 420 characters ? You know what , 420 isn't enough . To the comments section ! 
This has been quite enjoyable , so I'm going to remind everyone that I am still playing the number game . Send me a private message with a number , and I will put what I think of you as my status , preceded by the number you send me . And if you're brave , post this as your own status . 
12 : Oh 12 , how do I describe you , especially not having talked to you outside of Facebook in a year ? Truth is I regret us not warming up to each other before senior year ( give or take a few ) , because , though I may say this in many things like this when talking about people I don't know all that well , I really do wish I knew you better . 
18 : You have done a lot for me , 18 , more than you could ever know ; more than I could tell you , to be honest . You are the first person I ever opened up to as much as I opened up to you , and it was the start of a really important friendship in my life . Though I sometimes feel like I need to really be forceful to get a word in edgewise in our conversations , I wouldn't give up our friendship for the word . 
Really , this is very fun , so I'll say it again : I am playing the number game . Send me a private message with a number , and I will put what I think of you as my status , preceded by the number you send me . And if you're brave , post this as your own status . 
So I got the urge to go to Brew'd Awakening today , just to decompress , and what do I see when I walk in ? Six bears . Six burly , oversized men , just standing around talking . It's like someone up there knew I had be at Brew'd and put the idea in my head just so I could see this amazing sight . It was also , quite possibly , my first \I can't believe my eyes\ " moment . " 
I upgraded to the new profile design solely so I could tell the world that I speak Ubbi Dubbi , and Facebook won't even let me add non-recognized languages to my profile . Really , Facebook ? What the hell ... 
\Drama is gay man Gatorade . It replenishes their electrolytes . \ " \ 
As this semester comes to a close , I feel the need to prune the friends list again . If we have been in contact in the past few months at all , either on this website or in person , or you have told me you don't want to be cut from the list in the past , you will be spared . If neither of these apply to you and you worry for your possition on my friends list , let me know and I'll spare you .

Because I rarely back down from a challenge :\ 
INBOX ONLY ! 2010 is almost over . Confess something you've always wanted to tell me ; it will stay between us . Put this as your status and see who surprises you . 
I'm back home , which means I have no reception unless I leave my house . Call me on my home phone if you need to contact me , or do so here , because it will take me a while to get your texts , and you probably won't reach me if you try to call . 
These are the dangers inherent in animation :\

Being that I am notoriously difficult to buy presents for , at the risk of appearing presumptuous , I present you a list of things I am guaranteed to like :\ 
- < PROPFEMALE > that combines chocolate and mint or chocolate and peanut butter ( but not peanuts , and certainly not caramel)\ 
-manly jewelry\ 
-gift cards to places you have seen or heard of me actually buying things from\ 
-nerdy shirts ( size medium ) 
Since I don't know who's home and who isn't , I'm putting out this general message that I am free to < PROPFEMALE > out tomorrow , and if you can see this , it's because I want to see you at some point over winter break . If the feeling is mutual and you too are free tomorrow , contact me somehow ASAP .

( Let's see what happens when I do this . ) In order to discourage people from poking me indiscriminately , I shall now interpret any poke I receive as flirtation and react accordingly . 
I had a dream last night where I cut off half of my hair , just to see how people would react , but kept the hair I cut off in a ponytail , as if I'd be able to reattach it . Thank God it didn't actually happen .

your humor style :\ 
CLEAN | COMPLEX | LIGHT\ 
Your humor has an intellectual , even conceptual slant to it . You're not pretentious , but you're not into what some would call ' low humor ' either . You'll laugh at a good dirty joke , but you definitely prefer something clever to something moist . 
This is the perfect weather for one of my favorite winter delicacies : < PROPFEMALE > snow . 
Bitch , you can work a < PROPMALE > , but you cain't work my corner ! 
Sometimes , I can be redundant from time to time . 
< PROPMALE > Python and the Holy Grail is the final film we will be viewing for Philosophy and Film . This is made of so much win . 
I'm finally back in a room on the second floor . It's good to be back home .

So it turns out anticipating sex makes a man's beard grow faster . I have been trying to grow my beard out recently , but have found that it grows at a snail's pace . I need you to do me this favor ... 
1 . Publish a novel . \ 
2 . See how it is received\ 
3a . If it is well received , revel in new-found respect . \ 
3b . If it is poorly received , claim novel is full of symbolism and motifs that clearly went over everyone's head . Scholars will poor over novel and give unnecessary importance to accidental/insignificant patterns so they can appear intelligent . Be vindicated by history . \ 
Problem , literary critics ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , you are the devil . Come see me for more details . 
Fucking friend zone . That's all I have to say . 
It's the end of an < PROPFEMALE > today : I have canceled my WoW account . This game gave me five and a half great years of play time , but I've given it a lot of thought and realized the game has been moving in a more group-oriented direction that is just not compatible with my playstyle . Rather than kvetch , I'll take the hint and move on . Adiue , Blizzard ; parting is such sweet sorrow . 
I'm glad facebook finally got on the ball and added Ubbidubbi to the languages I can claim to be able to speak . 
It has been less than 24 hours , and I already miss being a WoW player . But actually playing WoW ? Nope , can't say I miss that . I guess it always was the community that kept me playing . 
How did this song lose to \Before I Forget\ " for Best Metal Performance ? That's an atrocity . \ 
\Suche gut gebauten Achtzehn- bis Dreißigjährigen zum schlachten . \ 
A request for you metalheads : find me a metal song(s ) and/or metal band(s ) that fits the following criteria :\ 
1 . Is from one of the heavier and more extreme metal sub-genres ( black metal , death metal , grindcore , etc . )\ 
2 . A least 25% of its/their lyrics are understandable upon first listening without needing to actually look up the lyrics . 
Apparently there are people who think < PROPFEMALE > White is the best drummer of our time . This personally offends me ; I'M a better drummer than her , and I'm not even that great .

My computer's spell-checker didn't know \kvetch\ " ? This is unacceptable . " 
My plans for the evening : catch up on homework , work on my Minecraft project , finish up the laptop case I'm making from scratch , maybe go into < PROPMALE > and see what's going on with Winterfest .

Guitar Hero is dead , and good riddance . I knew the company that did it first would , in the end , end up doing it the best . 
Becoming the moderator of a forum has really brought out the inner mediator in me . I was about to write a multi-paragraph reply to an argument in the comment section of a friend's status update before I realized the people arguing were probably overly-opinionated twats who wouldn't listen to reason from someone they don't know . I have to remember that I only hold authority on one website , not the whole internet .

I AM A HANDFUL -Unfortunately most women WON'T re-post this . I'm strong willed , independent , a bit outspoken , and I tell it like it is . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle but I love and give with all my heart . If you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . If you are a HANDFUL , re-post ! I dare you .. I'll be looking for the ladies who re-post ! 
A question for my Minecraft-playing friends , which I am putting in the comments because it is too long for a status update . 
http://www.bugcomic.com/comics/home-ec-dreck/ 
My psych professor told me that , in writing my research paper in APA format , I need to cite every source that confirms a fact if I state that face . For much of my paper , this means three citations for the content . Do you know how long APA in-text citations are ? This is going to do wonders for the paper's length . 
\Don't hate pop ? artists for doing what makes them money

Is it bad that I've reached a point in my life where I'm not at all surprised when people flake out on me ? Where I half expect it to happen any time I make plans ? 
The shear amount of arithmophobia shown by most of the people in my non-math classes saddens me greatly . 
Attention certain women who need to hear this : double standards that favor you are NOT empowerment ; they only embitter men who may grow up to be your enemies in the quest for equality . 
I find the fact that we have a label for people who reject labels for sexuality ( pomosexual , if you are curious ) to be deliciously ironic . 
It's one of those \Why am I up this late when I have to get up at 6:35 ? \ " nights . " 
I would like my Facebook friends to comment on this status , sharing how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right , just make it up . After you comment copy this to your status , so I can do the same . I bet half won't read the instructions right .

My childhood has finally come full-circle . One year ago , I was out on a walk with my old roommate , and we found these sticks that brought me back to my childhood , when I would collect sticks that reminded me of guns or swords and use them for solo roleplay .

You know what would be fantastic ? If it turned out that the only people called by tomorrow's Rapture were the virtuous atheists .

Just stumbled upon this idea : what if , in order to reduce the effect of people whose messages we don't like ( say , the WBC , or the GOP , or proselytizers ) , we treated them like trolls ?

I just had an amazing dream : a bunch of DDR songs were added to Rock Band's DLC store , as was a skin for the game that changed the menu to look like the classic DDR menu , complete with a groove-radar style display ( the one that displays stream , voltage , air , freeze , and chaos ) for displaying the individual instrument difficulties .

Does anyone else listen to music this way , or am I just a weirdo ?

In all of recorded history , there are accounts of 3700 supernatural beings , 2870 of which can be considered deities .

Last semester , when I had to get up at 6:30 AM for class every weekday , I was never tired this early ( 10:30 PM ) , so I never went to bed early enough to get eight hours of sleep . Now , when I can sleep in as late as I want with no consequences ? I am . The fuck is this ? 
Like my status for :\ 
How we met -\ 
Your name in my phone -\ 
What I like best about you -\ 
Favorite memory -\ 
First impression -\ 
Have I liked you ? -\ 
Who are you to me -\ 
You should put this as your status - 
Question for my friends : the forum I moderate has a staff directory that includes , among other things , areas of expertise that the staff members can give advise on . I'm thinking of removing one entry from my life , but that will leave it pretty sparse ( in terms of expansiveness ) . Does anyone recall me giving them good advice on any particular subject , a subject I could add to the directory ? 
I'm disappointed with the world for making me promises it couldn't keep . 
Me : \We need to go to the basement . < PROPFIRST > 
I want the opinions of theists AND non-theists on this : Suppose we managed to raise a generation without religion . Through whatever means , we created a world population that has never been introduced to the idea of God or gods . Do you think this population , having never been indoctrinated with religion or theism , would \rediscover\ " God or recreate religion in any form ? " 
Alright peeps , question time : what are some songs that you really like from genres or artists you usually can't stand ? 
It appears that Facebook no longer publishes a piece of news when I change my religious or political views . My feelings about this are mixed . 
I need to get this off of my chest before it comes out dangerously : it's 30 Minutes or FEWER !!!! Fuck ! 
Playing along . \ 
Let's see who truly reads my status . You and I wake up in a police car handcuffed together . Using three words only , what would you say to me ? Note : if you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status so I can comment on yours as well . Have fun ; play along . 
I would just like to take this moment to give thanks for the lack of debilitating heat in recent days . 
\If one should find themselves so lucky as to get laid 
Tonight , I went from moderator at Empty Closets to administrator , the highest position on the staff . Moving on up ! 
“If you put as your Facebook status “I totally raped at Halo today” for your two hundred Facebook friends to see , statistically , you have just reminded thirty-three people of one of the worst experiences of their entire lives . \ 
To describe how well you did at a video game . \ 
Good job ! ”

Do I challenge you to put this as your status : 
While at work , I found a biography of a woman named < PROPFEMALE > Lamarr . Now those jokes in Blazing Saddles make total sense . 
\Dating in the gay world is like finding a job : you have to either do it on the internet or get referred . \"" 
Your grammar tip for the day : Are you about to use a colon ? Will your sentence make just as much sense if you remove the colon ? Well then , remove it . 
Does anyone recognize this pattern of piano chords ? \ 
http://mrodigga.tumblr.com/post/9121943294\ 
I was messing around with piano chords in GarageBand when I stumbled upon this pattern . It sounded eerily familiar , but I couldn’t figure out where I have heard it . Does anyone recognize it ? 
Let's clear this up once and for all :\ 
\Is this real life ? \ " = < PROPFIRST > After Dentist reference\ 
Rage-motivated status time : The world would be a better place if we could somehow exterminate religion . I will not be convinced otherwise , though you're welcome to try . 
I accidentally typed \mr a\ " while trying to type \ " me a\ " in a text today 
Often times when I listen to music , I'll listen to similar songs . But tonight ? Here's what I was in the mood to listen to , in order :\

You mean there was an earthquake and I didn't feel it at all ? I feel deprived . 
It's crazy to think that I hold within my hand the power to end a living being's life . She could be going along , just living her life , trying to get through the stresses of the daily grind , and like that , I've ended it all for her . She is now no more , all because I decided , \You don't get to live anymore . \ " \ 
Am I the only one trying to get ResLife to let me move in on Saturday instead of Sunday ? 
Am I the only one who thinks < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is criminally overrated ? 
That awkward when you read this status incorrectly . 
So who else is going to rough out this hurricane in these old dorms ? 
Story time , everyone ! This story is longer than 420 characters , though , so come gather ye round and listed to the story of UML's first fire alarm this year in Fox hall , a tale of deindividuation and unintentional mass freshmen hazing . More in the comments . 
Being that the campus is without wifi , I went downtown in search of my Internet fix . Alas !, my usual places where I go to chill and browse are closed for the hurricane , but I found one open place with password-less wifi which I'm standing outside of now . MetroPCS to the rescue again ! 
The privacy mechanics and settings have changed . Go make sure they are as you want them :\

I'm really not sure I'm comfortable with Facebook letting people know who can view my statuses . 
\Why settle for vanity when you can have pure egotism ? \ " \ 
Another new application , another thing to \Hide all by \"." 
Statuses of yesteryear : ( 631 ): He kept buying me shots of < PROPFEMALE > . I decided to just save myself the half hour of toilet hugging and tell him straight up that I intended on sleeping with him . We got Tacos on the way home with all the money we saved . 
Do any UML peeps know what Fox dining hall's schedule for today is ? 
\You're like best friends with severe boundary issues . \ " \ 
\Don't worry 
Anyone want to meet for lunch at Fox ? My mid-day is pretty free on Thursdays . 
Some construction machine outside of my dorm made the sound a Metal Gear < PROPFIRST > makes when it opens its maw and it about to attack . I nearly shat myself . 
Remember my furious anger at the university that happened over the summer ? It is now somewhat abated because rather than my Computing I class being taught by two professors with atrocious ratings on Rate My Professor , it's being taught by a post-grad student who knows how to teach , is anything but boring , and has one glowing review on RMP . Maybe this semester will be great after all . 
I'm sure one of my techie friends will know this : why is it that when I finish downloading a torrent and am seeding , it still often displays a small download speed on things that are being uploaded ? 
Alright peeps , I need some recommendations of good progressive metal songs . Not bands , please ; songs . ( I always feel aimless looking up band recommendations . If I like the song , I'll seek out more by that band . ) 
\So basically government should stay out of people's lives until it's needed to discriminate against minorities . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Hassett tried to put glasses on me while I was already wearing glasses . Yo dawg , we heard you like glasses , so we put some glasses on yo glasses , and now your prescription is messed up and you can't see . 
Friend of mine to another friend : \Aren't you a bit old to have an imaginary friend ? \ " \ 
Of course , every person I know who has liked this < PROPFEMALE > is a man , but one of them is black , at least . \ 
Like if you're a strong black woman who dont need no man 
It makes me so happy that someone made a loop site out of this gif . \

It has been an \I'm totally going to put this shit on my résumé\ " kind of night . " 
Let's clear up any misconceptions : atheism isn't a choice . I doubt theism is a choice , either , but I won't pretend to speak for anyone but myself , and my own atheism certainly wasn't a choice . 
Have any of you peeps ever had Tibor Beke ? If so , can you tell me how anal he is about details and technicalities when grading assignments if the assignment is a proof ? 
I was given T ... \ 
Something I like : T-shirts ( of the graphic variety , specifically)\ 
Something I don't like : Tipsy people\ 
Something I need : Trains\ 
Somewhere I've been : The Tides ( I couldn't think of a location , so I went with a restaurant)\ 
Like this status and I won't give you anything , because I don't feel like giving out letters all night . 
Saw a status from yesteryear about Shubov's accent . I miss it ... 
I wore my \I heart chubby bearded guys\ " shirt to Pride Alliance today . The response it got was pretty epic . " 
Depression & anxiety are not signs of weakness ; they are signs that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or had depression & anxiety . Will you do it , and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support . Depression & anxiety kills people every day . 
Status of yesteryear :\ 
\Some people just can't handle us . \

The French Wikipedia < PROPFEMALE > on modular arithmetic < PROPFEMALE > puts the English one to SHAME ! \

First Real Analysis homework : VANQUISHED !!! 
( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Hassett drops some trash and tells < PROPMALE > O'Connor ( her BF ) to pick it up . )\ 
Me : \Don't do it 
Is showing up when you said you would show up really too much to ask of people ? I honor my commitments , even the social ones ; why can't they ? 
Is anyone else with a legitimate copy of Minecraft unable to log into the servers and thus only able to play offline ? 
\He did this to me ! He branded me ! \"" 
I voted for Marck Clerveau , because I vote for people , not politicians . 
44° weather ... Now this is what I'm talking about . 
I'm used to feeling the wind in my hair , but today , for the first time , I felt it in my beard . This pleases me . 
Attention anyone in Tibor Beke's Symbolic Logic class : homework #6 turns really ugly real fast when you get to the second part ( the nand part ) . I talked with him about it today due to a nice bit of serendipity , and he said it's perfectly acceptable to use abbreviations when the functions get too long to be practical to write out fully ( if you don't , the final answer will take up around a dozen lines ) . Spread the word . 
This satisfies me on some deep level ( click on the pictures to get a closer look and see why ) . \

New profile pic . It's my spirit animal . 
Alright people , it's recommendation time again . I need names of good instrumental songs . Rock instrumentals are preferred , but as long as there is no singing and as long as it's good , I'll take recommendations from any genre . 
Alright people , survey time : if I asked you to tell me the manliest song you know , what criteria would you use for deciding which of the songs you know is the most manly ? \ 
( FWIW , I was talking about this with some friends of mine , and the best conclusion we could come to was that Celtic punk is the manliest music out there , though , reflecting on it now , viking metal might have it beat . ) 
STRAIGHT MALE FRIENDS ! A hypothetical situation for you : Suppose a guy you know asked you ( prefacing that he knows it's a long-shot ) if you date guys . You say no and ask why , and he says it's because he thinks you're cute , but hey , it doesn't matter now . How would you react ? ( Assume it's someone you get along with well . ) 
Everyone is going through some kind of struggle , no matter how ideal their life might seem to you . If you ever find yourself thinking that someone else's life is so much better than yours , think of how much better your life seems to them compared to how it really is . All that struggle and stress that you hide from others ? They're hiding something like that from you , too . Remember that . 
Beke , you crafty bastard ! 
I leave it to you , Facebook : tonight at UML Glee Club Presents KARAOKE IN THE COMMON , do I sing Misery Business by Paramore , No One Knows by Queens of the Stone Age , or Smash the Control Machine by Otep ? ( The votes of people who will be there to watch me sing count for ten of the votes of people who won't ) . 
Not a great follow-up afternoon to a horrible night . I'm taking a break from the world . I need me time , and massive amounts of it . 
Daria : ( being fitted for a bridesmaid's gown ) \I think I'm going to be ill . Is that a problem for you ? \ " \ 
Willow : \You have a very old soul . \ " \ 
I had to post this after I saw the names . This is just brilliant . \

My favorites are < PROPFIRST > as the healer ( totally appropriate ) , < PROPMALE > as the damsel in distress , and < PROPFIRST > as the final boss . 
\Long-haired metalheads are some of the nicest guys I've met . \ " \ 
Our ice-breaker question at the last Pride Alliance meeting was , what is your favorite super hero ? < PROPFIRST > Paquette's answer ? My hair . 
I bet there are very few people on either side of the gay marriage debate who truly understand how the people on the opposite side view the issue . 
So I lost my weekend to an assignment that I thought was due today , only to find out today that it's due in a month . FUCK . ME . 
Working in Fox's tutoring center from 5 to 11 . After the weekend I had , I'd be more than appreciative of visitors ( snacks are also appreciated , as are hugs ) .

“I think the trouble with being a critical thinker or an atheis or a humanist is that you’re right . And it’s quite hard being right in the face of people who are wrong without sounding like a fuckwit . People go “Do you think the vast majority of the world is wrong ? ” Well , yes . I don’t know how to say that nicely , but yes . \\
