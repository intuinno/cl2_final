ugh , someone in one of my classes called a pterodactyl a velociraptor ... It just bothers me ... 

lol When the friend Q&A asks me if I think someone is cute ... If I say yes , I don't mean it like I have a crush on anyone >_> I actually basically either say Yes or Skip the question 
Punk'd is a stuuuupid show , I hate that I have to watch it while I'm looking for somethin to watch . 
Wisdom teeth suck . I don't know if the pain of having them pulled would be worse than just growing in . 
The < PROPMALE > Potter Series is so amazing . I have to gush . lol I'm finishing it up tomorrow :P The chapter with all the revelations from Snape's memories was so good . imo . 
I just realized how many 90s songs I know only from Weird < PROPMALE>'s \Polka Power ! \ " XD " 
:S I retardedly cut two of my fingers with my xacto knife , then , freaking out , jerked it away and stabbed my leg a little bit . I then started going into shock a little bit or something - vision got dark , hearing got fuzzy and distant , got very pale . But then I breathed , drank water , and got better . lol 
I miss my friends :( 
? \ 
? It's sister week ! If you have a sister who has ever made you \ 
laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you tight , watched you succeed , saw \ 
you fail , cheered you on , and kept you strong ... copy and paste this\ 
on your status ... I LOVE MY SISTER !! ? ? 
ooo ooo ooo , guess what ? I hate < PROPFIRST > Mingus even more after seeing you guys ' Prom pictures :D 
My mom is saying she's gonna be waking me up at 7 for the rest of my vacation -_- \ 
And then , if the rest of my vacation is going to be anything like today , I will only get about 2 hours doing anything I actually choose to do . 
I haaaaate the stupid Twlight/vampire mania >_> \ 
Mostly Twilight though . 
The Doctor : All I've got to is pass as an ordinary human being . Simple . \ 
What could possibly go wrong ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Have you seen you ? \ 
The Doctor : \ 
So you're just going to be snide ? No helpful hints ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Hmm . Well , \ 
here's one ... *** Bow tie , get rid ! ***\ 
The Doctor : Bow ties are cool . Come \ 
on , < PROPFEMALE > . I'm a normal bloke . Tell me what normal blokes do ! 
Holy CRAP The Orphan is an insane movie . But really good lol\ 
plus I dyed my hair :D 
Why could I possibly need to know anything about \performance art\ " in order to be able to go into 3D computer animation ? " 
\Roger Clemens ? That guy who wrote < PROPFIRST > Twain ? \ " \ 
Browsing Myspace kinda makes me think of simpler , more innocent times . Lol Maybe that's because I made my account when I was in , I don't know , 8th grade . heh , but yeah , lots of memories connected therr . 
Full name : ___________ . Age : ________ . Birthday : ___________ . Eye color : _________ . Nickname : ___________ . Bestfriend : ______________ . Favorite color : ___________ Favorite Food : ________ . Post this to your wall and see who knows you . 
I like it in my backpack . hah fail . 
Ahhh , the < PROPMALE > Potter books are so win ! lol I hope everyone knows that . 
YAAYY only 2 days of class this week !!! 
type your name : Emily\ 
type your name with your elbow : 3emiol . 6666y\ 
type your name with your nose : emily\ 
type your name with your eyes closed : emilt\ 
type your name with your forehead : e3 milly\ 
\ 
lolol 
hahaha here's a poem one of my dad's old students in Japan wrote about him :\ 
hint if you need it : \gomi\ " = \ " trash\ " in Japanese\ 
:S My Modern Germany syllabus makes the class look kinda scary ... 
ugh - once school st < PROPMALE > s I end up never doing anything I actually want to . I'll take a break and kill time with stupid crap like checking facebook and deviant < PROPMALE > - but never can I sit down purely to have fun - or do my own < PROPMALE > stuff . 
Heyyy , AP < PROPFEMALE > people ! Remember when I used so many semicolons that I had a < PROPFEMALE > long sentence and we couldn't use sentence pattern 1 anymore ? lol I now use none of those variations in my writing . Good times . 
-_- I did * not * decide to do < PROPMALE > so I could write papers about other peoples ' < PROPMALE > . Also - general studies classes are crap . 
fml . 
WHY do people make tests the week after spring break !? I can't believe it was * impossible * to get the schedule to work out to where it was just before the break , when I had these things firmly in my mind and was reading textbooks about it every day . Bu it's over and I can stop freaking out . Only one more Chinese Painting test to go . And an essay -_- 
I don't care if no one watches < PROPFEMALE > n Idol - the fact that < PROPFEMALE > voted < PROPFIRST > off is not ok . What the judges and apparently < PROPFEMALE > are looking for is a \soulful\ " voice >_> < PROPFIRST > is so talented and he doesn't scream like a bunch of the others . He also doesn't put all the stupid little runs into his song . I hate that . " 
-_- so really , there's no way to know what a teacher will be like until you're in the class either hating life or breezing through it . People's opinions vary WAY too much to be certain of anything . Guess I'll just wait and see . 
Who else lives/has lived with their parents at least through part of college ?
