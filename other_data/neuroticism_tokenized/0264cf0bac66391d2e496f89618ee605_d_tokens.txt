had a temporary lapse of judgment yesterday , the first in many months , and now remembers what this guilt feels like . 

chat died . 
can equate life to a museum at 3 in the morning . 
wants to go to Florida , with an abundance of money to do the exciting things . 
just watched the video from that one friday . haha . 
is very surprised at that which she almost did , and still wants to do . 
wants sausage pizza . 
could not walk in a straight line , and is fairly certain she isn't drunk ? 
is thinking , hmmmm .... is this summer one for experimenting ? 
thinks it's weird when people she knows outside of school actually call her Angelynn . 
does , very much , not like only 4.5 hours of sleep , and would like some caffeine . 
is going to mow , for she is in need of green . 
is somehow involved in way too many awkward scenarios . my stepmother was trying to figure out how to get my phone to stop ringing , and she accidentally called wellington , whom she knows of but has never met and does not necessarily approve of . wow , that w 
is going to bed earlyish today . 
thinks lack of sleep is not cool . 
could have saved like 45 dollars on concert tickets if she had waited 6 days . 
is displeased . 
will have to get up semi early tomorrow . 
is off to St. < PROPFIRST > for a few days . 
has realized her mother is very much a slacker . 
did not change her status from her phone , facebook lies . 
gets really aggravated when people lose their shit then ask to borrow mine , what in the hell makes you think I will let you borrow mine ? You'd loose it too . 
has only to say , suffering is not a rite of passage . 
never got what she hoped for ... things are the same , if not worse ... excluding Wellington of course . 
FUCK ! lost her jump drive , containing a 90% complete paper , thats due tomorrow , and about 2 pages single spaced , and is not going to retype it in case she finds it , and probly wouldn't get it done anyway . 
loves the world with all people in it and every beast and plant that lives on it . i only want peace in the world for all creeds and nationalities . Let freedom sing from the mountain tops and teh valleys 
is at a stale mate , or in an it's complicated , with life . 
thinks if you're viewed as nothing by someone you're not going to be nice to them and never going to forget it , it takes them being genuinely nice for that to happen , so if they want it to change , thats what they need to do , not claim they are , in fact that makes things worse . 
cannot do anything about anyone else , and right now could care less . 
is good , for now , i think . 
there was something ... but now it is forgotten . 
if i painted it in watercolor , would you know what it was ? if i wrote it in words , would you know what it was ? if it was always there , would you have known ? 
you can not deny that people are biased . if they weren't , best friends would not exsist , everyone would marry anyone , cheating wouldn't be a big deal , fights would be many less , society would be civilized , and much more would be legal . if wishes were fishes ... 
applied to hy-vee ... and further continues her searching . 
when you release them , they loose meaning , and if you don't , they stay and torment . 
has one of those big , life , pessimistic questions again : if you truly feel bliss , why must the smallest , most minute thing cause an ever flowing , quickly devistating cascade of thoughts ? why can we not just live with the good , live in the moment , or just let it fade ? 
wishes she could really say what she was thinking , or do what she really wanted to do , that is , if she had the resources , but in truth , she cannot really do any of this because , and undoubtably , people would interfer , and only make it worse , because really they think you were already crazy , but it is they who make you crazy . 
thinks sprint and samsung seriously need to get their **** together , this is the 4th phone I've had the same problem with , I mean really ... 
is thinking in a chain reaction .... anything else said is summarized with this , or is furthering this . 
is having a bad summer . 
had a day of ... unexpainable thoughts . 
is having a pretty freaking horrible day so far . 
feels like right decisions no longer exsist , because you're always wrong in someones eyes . 
can't sleep . 
\I really need to talk ... it keeps the voices from closing in around me like darkness . \"" 
would post a musing about several summers ago , but then again , in that case this musing would be proven correct , and we can't have that now can we ? 
had the most beautiful , yet messed up , dream ever . 
probly won't sleep . 
wunscht , dass weiss sie mehr deutsch , < PROPFEMALE > koennte sie alle private Gedanke im Status schreiben , ohne Leute wissen , aber sie weiss nicht genug , wie schade . 
wishes she knew . 
summer felt like nothing this year . 
has a feeling no one she knows will have classes with her : \ 
us-schw < PROPMALE > z\ 
english 3-materer\ 
int 3 math- pingrey\ 
photo 1-grant\ 
ap < PROPMALE > 1-grant\ 
b lunch\ 
ap physics b\ 
h chem-brooks 
hates her luck with technology , especially sense it only fails when i need it . DAMNED AP PHYSICS !!!! 
had a really , and i do mean really , shitty first day of < PROPMALE > year . 
got really pissed at her < PROPMALE > teacher today . 
anyone who has my number should call me or text me so i have your number again without having to go through and type them all in . and leave your name , because i guarantee i have no idea what your number is . 
wishes she knew more people in AP physics sometimes .... 
why must my favorite subject be the hardest class I'm taking ? 
feels like crap , way to go getting sick . 
man my stomach hurts . and I've missed 4 days , and I miss Physics , < PROPMALE > Rios should tell me what they did , and I will be back tomorrow dammit . 
oh silly ange and your leaving out of your phone lolololol 
i like tagging people in statuses , its like leaving them little presents they didn't want to see , like < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > should fix my glitchy computer , see , such fun , and then we would hunt down < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Cutts . the end . 
likes substantial conversation with human beings , which does not necessarily happen in high school . 
feels so powerful with a camera in her hands , it's like possessing a weapon only few can use , with the weight of it making it's existence known . 
wishes she were still in band , and played tuba , so as to play sousaphone for marching band , it sounds quite phenomenal/ spectacular . 
attacked her knuckles with some heavy duty lotion and neosporin , we will see if they stop hurting . 
sincerely fucking hates AP Physics sometimes . 
wonders how much she doesn't say , but on a completely different note , that was quite the experience . 
was in her room for about 40 minutes , then looked outside , and the road , it's alreeady covered . 
in facebook chat :/ \how does one make that face ? \ " \ " have a stroke\ " courtesy of anonymously horrible . " 
watched transformers 1 and 2 over the snow days , and is excited for the third . admittedly i liked the first better , but i think switching out < PROPFEMALE > fox this late in the game is going to make the third harder to warm up to . 
wishes there weren't snow on everything , because outside feels like a great place to be , but then there's snow . 
I LOVE SAMY . <3 
quick , tell me jokes , don't ask why just go ! 
thinks she may grow to hate Christmas by association : Mr. Scoville , pyhsics teacher , \it's Christmas . \ " hands children a pop quiz . now you see . " 
stuck in a wreck , 79 < PROPMALE > from columbia , at 7 15 on a sunday , before a physics test ... 
my computer is telling me lies again ..... it is at risk .... 
life doesn't need to be back , i assure you Florida can stay forever , and not run away from that plane so desperately quickly , of this i assure you . 
thanks people for all the birthday stuff , and wish things , also i am impressed with the surprise of that party ....
