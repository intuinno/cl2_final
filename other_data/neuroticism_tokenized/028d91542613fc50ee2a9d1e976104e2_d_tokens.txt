Seeing truth but feeling weird . . . . 
bored 
Feeling sicker than ever before . . . 
Sore all over , and is disappointed about the out come of the Knowing . . 
hurting all over . . 
tired , sore , repeat . . tired , sore , repeat . . 
Truth is mixing with false perception . .

love is becoming more of a < PROPFEMALE > tale than reality . . :( . . 
2 more days until college life . . . woot woot . . . 
Got a new computer puppy to keep my smile . . its a black lab . . ;) . . 
At collage .... its fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..... it is not kidding 
college is so over rated . . new seniors you have nothing to worry about . . 
I'm in class doing nothing . . lol . . 
tired . . tired . . tired . . tired . . repeat . . . 
boy oh boy oh boy . . a rough couple of days ahead of me . . 
still out of it from the news of yesterday . . . 
High light of the day : Potato Soup ! ! . . its amazing . . ;p . . 
No campus job for me i guess . . . 
I got a graphic tablet and it is like sweet ! 
Easier to be the influenced than the influencer 
On a Pilgrim's journey with one goal . . the heavenly city . . want to join ? 
not feeling so hot . . . . 
in my class and it is really boring . . . ;p . . . 
I am going to lose my mind . . . . . 
stress emotionally and physically doesnt do me justice . . . . . 
the movie Legion is 100% against God . . . . . 
tired of life and to tired to care about the problem . . . 
is wondering what fully happened the last 5 days . . .

new information . . . it's getting over whelming . . 
is glad its the weekend . . . 
is home in the little town of Mentone for the Saturday only ! . . . 
is back at college and missing the rest of her friends she didnt have time to see . . 
is wondering when life will be about not living then but living now . . . 
\We get so much in the habit of wearing disguises before others that we finally appear disguised before ourselves\ " . . i am so confused about many things right now . . this is me . . " 
I am coming to know the truth in many things lately . . . 
. . to tired to want to deal with anything anymore . . its a friday . . 
hhuumm . . Pepper < PROPFIRST > Cheese-Its are amazing ! . . 
Life can be so cruel even to the most innocent . . 
what would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything ? 
I miss all my friends from home and church ! . . 
OMGNESS . . its so cold . . where did all the heat go ? . . 
spiritually , mentally , physically drained . . or plainly i'm sick and it hurts . . 
Courage is not the absence of fear , but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear 
Getting really tired . . of fake friendships . . 
I'm finding that not all who wonder are lost . . . 
What is it with peoples view on beauty . . 
Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets 
wow looks like i'm not getting a break from being sick .. 
No one who hides behind closed doors are free , for they are imprisoned by their own fear . . . . 
Isn't is Ironic ? We ignore those who adore us , adore those who ignore us , love those who hurt us , & hurt those who love us ? 
How is the world did i get here ? . . 
Going home for the weekend ! . . finally get to relax . . 
I'm finding that moving on is simple , what you leave behind that makes it difficult 
Having to wake up to reality . . no time to dream anymore . . 
mid-term testing coming already . . so not cool . . 
Coming down to a couple of hard choices . . . 
It's going to be a long weekend . . . . 
i'm finding that stress is the confusion created when one's mind overrides the body's basic < PROPFEMALE > to choke the living daylights out of some jerk who desperately deserves it .. 
it really sux when you lose or are about to lose someone close to you . . it hurts . . 
sux when you are so tired and it takes all your energy to get to class to find it cancelled .. lol .. owell .. 
I am finding that if you see the magic in a < PROPFEMALE > tale , you can face the future 
I am finding that fear is God's warning signal to get busy . . . . . 
Will I ever see what you could see in me ? 
I'm done pretending . . done sitting on the side lines of life . . 
why do classes have to start on a Monday ? . . 
Thank God . . i am passing all my classes . . so stress free now . . ;) . . 
It is not love that is blind , but jealousy ; which ends up hurting the ones you love . . 
to think a car reck can make one feel so sore .. agh .. 
doesnt anyone live an original life ? What did you surrender to be on the in crowd ? 
I wonder what its like to have it all , to never be afraid that I would fall . . 
Going to the doctor's tomorrow .. pray they dont find anything wrong .. 
results from yesterday : Concussion and very bad body pains . . . 
X-ray and CT Scan results : Positive for no damage . . thank the Lord . . 
If head aches increase the next step will be a MRI scan .. hope that doesnt happen .. 
I see that the key to change is to let go of all my fears . . . 
I gaze out a darkened window to a broken sky . . . 
who wants to plant a pizza plant ? . . . 
I am finding that < PROPMALE > is the only way to run away without leaving home 
I'm ready to be done with everything . . and just escape . . 
R.I.P. is the only way to really get any sleep now days ... 
i found that if you lose yourself your courage soon will follow .. so be strong ... 
I'm finding that you might be done with < PROPMALE > but < PROPMALE > is never done with you .... 
.. <3 .. I would risk you hating me as long as in the end i know i still love you .. <3 .. 
i live .. because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help . . 
i'm thinking that perhaps our eyes need to be washed by tears now and then , so that we can see Life more clearly again .. 
though the world may think Im losing touch with reality .. It would be crazy to choose this world over eternity .. 
maybe all we need to do is stop planning our lives and start living them ... 
omgness ... Tofurky and Gravy soda , the new Jones Sodas .. ummm .. how about eeewww ... sounds gross ... 
If everything around us is beautiful than why do we find a need to change it ?.. 
i have no clue what to say or think . . . 
Looks like in the end i am right . . even if they say its not true i know it is . . its proven . . 
i hope that what seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings that are hidden at first ... 
sux when you have friends and know they are lying to you and dont care ... 
going to have to face my past and present when writing my english paper .. wish me luck .. 
this is going to be a long weekend .. fun fun .. 
If i am so good at helping ppl why cant i help myself ?... 
if we are the generation of change , then why do we tare down those trying to change the world for the better ?.. 
to the unloving , the unfaithful , the hurting , the dreamless , the ungreatful , the unwanted .. I Love You .. 
i'm finding that < PROPMALE > is our senses on fire fueled by imagination .. 
what in the world is going on .. sick then not then sick again .. agh .. 
to me the smartest people are those who fight , get beat , rise , and fight again .. 
nothing ever happens the same way twice ... 
I hope everyone has a great break and safe trips .. will miss you all .. l8er .. 
So glad to be home and hanging with old friends again .. 
sickness never takes a break . . . owell . . . 
i'm finding that when we doubt our abilities and who we are , we give power to our doubt .. 
2012 is not to bad of a movie but not what i thought it to be like .. still good .. 
my heart is missing people that left and it will never stop loving them ... 
I feel more alive then i have for the past 3 year ... 
i have a new look on things and a new cell phone .. 
After what i have heard i can work to be at peace with a big part of my past .. :) .. 
My life is great !!!!! <3 
i feel a strong urge to join my friends and jump from 15,000 feet .. 
going to have to face something i am hoping isnt the answer ... 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > concert was the best that i have ever gone to see !!! ;) .. 
im am coming down to a choice idk if my heart can bare ... 
you call my name , I come to you in broken pieces , so you can make me whole ... 
time going by way to fast .. need time to slow things down .. 
let it snow , let it snow , let it snow . . . 
keeping hope and taking things slowly .. trusting instead of relying on fear .. 
Want more snow just minus the cold .. lol .. 
Things happen for the better of us and not the worse .. hold onto that hope .. 
I was doing homework and ended on facebook ... 
im finding that there will be many friends that walk in and out of my life but only the true friends will leave their footprints behind .. 
LOL .. is most commonly used when we run out of things of importance to say or have nothing else to say on im , text , or anything else for that matter .. 
Had an interesting and fun time last night .. 
I'm looking for an internship to take < PROPMALE > classes in Japan .. 
Im either moving to California , New York , Florida , Japan , or Germany in the next couple of years .. more likely Japan though .. 
I think this will be my last year at tech .. i am for some reason on fire to trasnfer and go to japan .. 
One more left . . . 
is being silent ... 
is happy to be away from everything for a month and hoping things clear up .. 
what is going on with pokemon on facebook ?.. thought it was dead history .. 
Caffeine + ADHD = Danger lol .. ;) .. 
Dont you love when the unexspected happens and your speechless ?.. 
the 23 flavors of Dr. Pepper : -Amaretto , almond -blackberry , black licorice -carrot , clove - < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > -cola , < PROPFEMALE > -juniper , lemon -molasses , nutmeg -orange , prune -plume , pepper -root beer , rum -raspberry , tomato -vanilla ... i'm surprized alot about wuts in it .. wow .. 
is tired of ppl telling others to do as they wish and wut they believe is right .. then they condem them for doing it and treat them like crap .. 
Lord I lift my friends to you , I've done all that I know to do , I lift my friends to you . Complicated circumstances have clouded their view , and I fear that I won’t have the words that they need to hear . I pray for your wisdom , oh God and a heart that's sincere , and Lord I lift my friends up to you . Lord I lift my friends to you my best friends in the world , I know they mean much more to you . I lift my friends to you . 
i have not been called to the wisdom of this world but to a god calling out to me and even though the world make think im losing touch with reality it would be crazy to choose this world over eternity .. 
why do we hurt the ones trying to change the world when we encourage them to be a light to the world ?.. just shows wut a lifeless world we really are .. 
it hurts when some people assume things about people around them when they dont know wuts going on then say things that hurts those people before they even try to understand .. really hurts .. 
i think i am in heaven .. 3-D Animation is like so amazing .. yay me .. lol .. 
wuts it going to take to make people see my reflection isnt really a work of beauty ?.. 
I wonder what it's like to have it all to never be afraid that I would fall .. 
Doesn't anyone here live an original life ?.. Or did you surrender to be on the inside ?.. 
there is just no winning when it comes to some friends . . but i love you all anyway with a full heart . . . 
this weekend just crashed and became pointless . . 
I don't wanna be afraid . . I wanna wake up feeling beautiful . . yea like that will happen . . :( . .

I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy .. Come on , Squishy Come on , little Squishy .. 
What really bothers me is people who look down on others who struggle with learning .. Just because they struggle with learning doesnt mean they are any less of a person .. So love me for me or dont love me .. because what you see is what you get .. ;) .. 
it hurts me when i see people hurting others who try to make a difference .. thought we wanted a world of positive change ?.. isnt that why we encourage people for a better world ?.. 
To all those who are lost , hurting , and alone .. I LOVE YOU .. even if i might not know you .. you always have me as your friend .. so < PROPFEMALE > in there you'll live to see a brighter day .. let me know if you guys need anything .. ^o^ ..

oh how I HATE COMPUTERS !!!... 
those were my nails .. that was my crown .. that pierced your hands and your brow .. those were my thorns .. those were my scorns .. those were my tears that fell down .. 
Why does someone believe you when you say there are four billion stars , but check when you say the paint is wet ?

The rain is heavy and cold ..

Its not the fact of wut they said that hurts me but the fact they choose to lower themselves to hurt others and myself .. 
Aagghh sleep .. i thought u were my friend ... 
Saying hi is so easy but i find it hard to say good-bye .. this time idk if i can .. 
Tears form on my saddened face , their trail warm against my cold cheeks .. such a salty taste they leave as they disappear into lips moist with regret ... 
If people evolved from apes , why are there still apes ? 
Dont tell me wut makes up water .. Why is water wet ??..
