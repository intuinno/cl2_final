Google DOSN'T have children , your intuition is the expert 
ecost per change with disposables is $0.36 assuming baby is potty trained by 2/12 and used an average of 7 dipes a day ( more- newborn/ less older ) that's $2577 . \ 
average cost of a FANCY cloth system $1413 \ 
that's a $1164 savings . and if you use prefolds and covers that's a savings of like $2150 including cost for water/electric/detergent AND thats enough diapers to only have three extra loads of laundry a week .
