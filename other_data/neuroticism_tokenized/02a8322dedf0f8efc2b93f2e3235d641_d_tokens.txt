The Cowboys are in the playoffs . Today is a great day to be a cowboy fan ! Now lets send a message to those Eagles 

My New Year's Resolution is to not make any resolutions for 2011 ... I have already failed ... 
USA !!! USA !!! USA !!! Wow !!!!!!!! 
Finally ..... 
Just saw Step Up 3D , and I'm 100% sure I was \Born from a Boombox\ " . But it sure was a sucky way to find out I was adopted :-( " 
Everyone needs to check out my < PROPMALE > Will's video at staticshorts.blogspot.com, it's hilarious !!! 
Thanks everybody , today was great ! 
What's up my Nintendos ?!?!? 
Okay , so this dude in the bathroom yesterday used a urinal that was already pretty much full to capacity , stared at it , thought about it for a second ... and promptly flushed the urinal spilling a massive amount of water on the floor ..... and that was your \Really ? \ " moment of the week " 
Talk about every Cowboy fan's nightmare : Not only did the cowboys have a horrible year , but now we might see the freakin steelers celebrate a 7th championship on our turf ? This hurts ..... 
Bucket List : Run in a 7 degree wind chill . Check . Immediately regret my decision . Check . Potential sickness coming on ? Crossing my fingers guys !!! 
I said Brrrrrr !!!! It's cold out there , There must be an Arctic Cold Front in the atmosphere ! I said Brrrrrr !!!! It's cold out there , There must be an Arctic Cold Front in the atmosphere ! O-E-O-E-O Ice ! Ice ! Ice ! Slow it down ( Drive Carefully ) O-E-O-E-O Ice ! Ice ! Ice ! - Paid for by the North Texas Meteorologist Association 
Woo-Hoo !!! TGI ... WTF ???? Again ? Really ? ( sigh ) ..... 
It's SUPER BOWL DAY !!! aka NATIONAL PIG OUT DAY !!! aka BRAND NEW COMMERCIAL DAY !!! aka remember your team sucks and isn't good enough to make it to the super bowl day :-( 
We hold these truths to be self evident , that the steelers have a right to suck as much they want to ! 
How funny would it have been if < PROPFIRST > Jones knocked < PROPMALE > Staubach out and stole the trophy 
The cowboys got dissed on Glee ! OH HELL NAH !!! That was a low blow , it can't get any worse ... 
Life Lesson # 337- When it comes to customer service and the worker has a choice between a dude and an attractive female , attractive female always wins . Solution - Set yourself on fire , because that's the only way your gonna get noticed . 
Is going to get a Grammy someday .......... not earn one , but steal one . I'm gonna go Ocean's Eleven all over Kanye West's ass !!! 
\Life moves pretty fast . If you don't stop and look around once in a while 
I feeling weird this morning ... I was gonna talk about the importance of being humble ... but why should I be humble ? I'M A WINNER !!! Whoa ... where did that come from ? I'M TIRED OF ACTING LIKE I DON'T HAVE A KICK-ASS LIFESTYLE !!! What ? Oh no ... not that ... anything but that ... I think I have ... THE SHEENS !!! 
The Hulk is scared to make me angry , because he wouldn't like it when I'm angry . 
After 4 years I finally have a game system again ! I got a PS3 , I.D. awill19 . Hit me up , if you feel like getting beat in some Madden haha 
Why in the world did Texas call a timeout and not let Arizona foul them ! They blew it ... 
Oh no ! It's Judgement day !!! Everyone stock your weapons ! Hide in your cellars ! Nevermind that fact that Skynet doesn't exist . They went back and forth in time so many times , Skynet has become Facebook !!! It's happening people , the machines are taking over !!! 
This is awesome and everything , but just because Bin Laden's dead , doesn't mean terrorism goes away .... 
I wonder how many bounty hunters are disappointed today . I bet they were positive they were getting that 25 million . Everyone keep the bounty hunters who are left without a purpose now , in your thoughts . 
YEEEEAAAHHH !!!!! Boy am I happy , but we got away with one . Kidd fouled the HELL out of Kobe , but I'll take it :-) 
This team is different .... AND I LIKE IT !!! 
You know Mavericks , just when I think you couldn't possibly disappoint me anymore in the playoffs , you go and do something like this ..... AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELVES !!!!! YEEEEEAAAAAHHHHH !!!!! 
Everyone needs to go see Bridesmaids ..... absolutely Hilarious !!! I think it deserves to be considered among the Mount Rushmore of comedies like Old School , Anchorman , Wedding Crashers , Superbad , and The Hangover , it's that good ! 
Lol Closed Caption typists need to concentrate more . I don't think the Thunder were trying to GARDEN < PROPMALE > . Although a lot of those defenders feet were planted like they were ground roots haha 
TIGER JUMP !!! LMAO !!!! < PROPFIRST > Griffin just won me over 
Mavs drank their tough juice today ! Awesome Win !!! Wow ... 
On the road to redemption ; we blazed a trail , swept through the waters of the lake , and silenced the thunder . The heat is beginning to rise . It's time to make things right .... 
If this bizzaro universe this playoffs has been is any indication , in relation to 2006 , Mavs should win the series in 6 . 
The NHL's Atlanta Thrashers are moving to Winnipeg , Canada finally righting a wrong for so many years . This has to be the most significant sports story today already , I honestly don't know what could possibly top it . 
I think I have reverse < PROPFEMALE > vu ... talking about exercising demons , WOW ... SERIES ON !!! 
Sherman : But I don't understand Mr. Peabody . Why does everyone fall asleep when they look at this ? \ 
Peabody : It's an old Spanish custom Sherman\ 
Sherman : It is ? \ 
Peabody : Of course . This girl's name is < PROPFEMALE > . And you know when you \See < PROPFEMALE >\" you fall asleep . " 
Regret for the things we did can be tempered by time ; It is regret for things we did not do that is inconsolable . - < PROPFIRST > Smith 
They made rock em sock em robots into a movie ... lame ... 
Turnovers , turnovers , turnovers . If they Mavs take care of the ball , they win . Simple ... 
Epic series so far , Mavs have to take Game 5 . And it's official < PROPMALE > is < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > is Pippen . Miami only goes as far as < PROPMALE > takes them ... 
Gotta check out foxes jumping on trampoline on YouTube . Absolutely brightened my day :-) 
Just 1 more ... I'm ready to lose my mind and party on Sunday !!! LETS GO MAVS !!!!! 
I wanna do a flash mob ... 
I got a feeling ... 
It's right there Mavs , time to do what y'all do and own the 4th Quarter 
As a fan , this makes up for : those nasty silver uniforms , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , the 3 J's , < PROPFIRST > Rodman , 2006 collapse , 11-71 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , Wang Zhizhi , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Legler , < PROPMALE > Perot , < PROPFIRST > Dampier , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , 1st round exits , < PROPMALE > Daniels , < PROPFIRST > Buckner , < PROPMALE > Cleamons ..... going through pain makes victory that much sweeter . Congratulations Mavs ! WE DID IT !!! 
After this series , JJ Barea needs to write a book . That guy speaks to the belief that anything you put your mind to , you can achieve . That dude was an undrafted 5'8 point guard , and now he's a vital piece on a championship team and dating a former MISS UNIVERSE !!! Like Waterboy , \YOU CAN DO IT !!!!! \"" 
Now that the Mavs are NBA Champs , I wanna see < PROPMALE > host the season premiere of Saturday Night Live . I think he'll do a good job ... 
\Follow your bliss\ " - < PROPFIRST > Campbell " 
I like discovering new music :-) 
Green Lantern = eh 
I am a musician , who works at Target on the side . Not the other way around . I lost track of that ... now I know what I need to do . 
They call me Skittles , cause my shot arcs so high it tastes the rainbow ! 
Everything's going to be all right :-) 
\Yeah I don't want to live my life for tomorrow\

Are < PROPFEMALE > fish big ? 
Anybody that really likes Conan O'Brien should check out this new Documentary called \Can't Stop\ " . It follows how Conan was doing in the time between getting booted from the Tonight Show and starting his new show on TBS . " 
Nice to see the Rangers represented at Wimbledon 
My curfew was the porch light . My parents called my name , not my cell . I played outside with friends , not online . If I didn't eat what was cooked for dinner , I didn't eat . Sanitizer didn't exist . But you COULD get you mouth washed out with soap . I rode a bike without a helmet , getting dirty was ok & neighbors LOVED YOU as much as your parents did . Re-post if you drank from a garden hose and survived . 
I wake up to find that Tsonga already broke Djokovic on the first set .... this guy plays for keeps ! 
YEAH !!! The power of Ranger Nation is back in Tsonga's corner ...

\WE are the music makers ... WE are the dreamers of dreams . \"- < PROPMALE > Wonka " 
\If you want to view paradise\ 
Received an involuntary Botex injection from a group of ants hanging out on my water glass ... not a fan ... Why in the world would any woman do this to their face ? 
FB poll : Do any of you listen to the radio anymore ? If not , why ? 
FB poll #2 : Do you feel radio stations play the artists and songs you want to hear ? 
Uh-oh , UTA's stepping up to the WAC ? Nice , but they gotta get football in there now ... it's UNACCEPTABLE to not have a football team in Texas ... it's what we do

\Once in a Lifetime\ " by the Talking Heads has a really nice groove to it . I'm definitely in an 80's mood right now ..... " 
My phone is completely operational , but the home and sleep buttons don't work ... I got First World Problems ... 
\Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor . It's a gift to the world and every being in it . Don't cheat us of your contribution . Give us what you've got . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Pressfield " 
I was watching the show Friends with Benefits , when a trailer for Friends with Benefits the movie came on , and my head exploded . I tried to pick up the pieces but there were no strings attached . 
< PROPFEMALE > Monae , where have u been all my life ? That girl has TALENT !!!
