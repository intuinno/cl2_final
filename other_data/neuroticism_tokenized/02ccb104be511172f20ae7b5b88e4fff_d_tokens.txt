Wondering why you're only seeing status updates from the same people ? Facebook has changed its News Feed so that by default you can only see updates from people you have recently interacted with ! To change this click the arrow next to ' most recent ' then \edit options\ " and tick the box to receive updates from ALL friends . Most importantly - repost this !
