going to spend the rest of tonight polishing the 167 < PROPFEMALE > document that is due by noon tomorrow . BLAH !

wondering if i should continue to vacuum the stairs constantly , or start vacuuming gunner instead . also going to buy a little handheld vacuum after work as gunner's hair has clogged our big vacuum's tube . 
Gunner is one year old today ! And only 112 lbs one year later . haha . 
Drake might possibly make his appearance today :) We shall see !

Gonna run as far as I can today ... which hopefully is far , because I am WAY behind on my running . 
Possibly Drake's birthday tomorrow ... or maybe he will wait until Wednesday so he can share his birthday with Uncle < PROPFIRST > :) 
is an auntie ! 
happy birthday to < PROPFIRST > :) and only FOUR days until april and < PROPFIRST>'s wedding !! 
Wedding weekend starts with BACHELORETTE tonight ! 
what a beautiful wedding and a gorgeous bride :) 
Gunner treated himself to an $80 toy yesterday , which consisted primarily of my nice black heels , with a sock thrown in . He's lucky he's so irresistably lovable ... 
moving 50 feet away to a new cube now causes my phone to roam all day - yuck ! 
heading up to the twin cities today to visit my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! :) 
Running with < PROPFEMALE > ... hopefully far , but we'll see what we're able to do ! 
my mother found her way on to facebook ... scary . 
new < PROPFIRST > brown book out today ! ( yes , I know I am a nerd ... ) 
what's going on tonight ?? 
eating sunday dinner with the fam made by yours truly :) 
1 mile to E ... a new low ( both literally and figuratively ) . 
I hope kona has my phone ... because my house , car , and purse didn't have it . 
My phone is safely locked away in Kona's safe . We will be reunited at lunch time . 
Goin to the game today ... last time I went I was 16 . Go Huskers !! 
Husker game was amazing ... why haven't I been going all these years ? 
Another Tuesday , another pint night . 
Strategically signed up for Monday and Wednesday night class starting in Nov - no pint night interference , no siree . 
and < PROPFIRST > are going to pick out gump in 2 hours . 
no more gump ... gump got vetoed . now we have a < PROPMALE > . 
just found out that I will be going to the packers-vikings game on monday night !! saweet !

Cheering on the PACK tonight at the metrodome ! Incredibly sore ... good thing our seats are 5 rows from the top ... 
Going to pick up the newest member of our family after work today :) Can't wait for Gun to meet < PROPMALE > ! 
dilemma ... huskers ... or < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding ? what to do , what to do ... 
GO HUSKERS !!! 
SSSUUUUHHHHHHHH ! how bout that fourth quarter ? 
Broncos are 5-0 . The difference between being a true die-hard Broncos fan and a Broncos supporter by association is 18 celebratory beers - < PROPFIRST>'s 20 to my 2 . 
Just learned that < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s wedding is on On Demand . I know what I am doing tonight . 
is wondering how best to convince < PROPFIRST > to dress up < PROPMALE > and gunner as < PROPMALE > and big for halloween ... 
Gunner : 5 Remotes : 0 
Went home to discover that < PROPMALE > had scaled his 4 foot tall cage and escaped ... luckily ( for him ) nothing in the house was destroyed or peed on . 
First v-ball game of the season tonight - go Scared Hitless !! 
Solid start to the season - nice work team . 
has an ambitious week planned . Which in no way guarantees that I will follow through , but at least the planning is in place ... 
Can't wait til my nephew comes trick or treating on Saturday :) 
My 2 month old nephew's mom says he wants special dark chocolate for halloween ... sounds fishy to me . 
is work over yet ?? KC bound tonight , < PROPFIRST > bound tomorrow ! 
heading to the stockyards in Ft . Worth - should be interesting :) 
what to do what to do ... shopping & boozing most likely . maybe some pool time somewhere in there . 
leaving Texas today and have to say goodbye to miss < PROPFEMALE > :( 
Managed to lock myself out of both my car and my house this week - 24 hr locksmiths are not cheap . :( 
I think my stock-umentary is pretty good representation of the stockyard experience . 
I have a good feeling about this pot of chili ... 
< PROPFIRST > comes home today ! Haven't seen him since last Wednesday ... Gun and < PROPMALE > miss him too :) 
I have a whole < PROPMALE > full of coffee and I'm not afraid to drink it 
Just a regular sized cup of coffee this morning ... I think I OD'ed on caffeine yesterday . 
And after that morning meeting , looks like I'll need a LOT of coffee this week and next . 
well I'm not going to say volleyball is fun , but it's definitely entertaining . old chicago afterwards is always fun :) 
:) 
engagement party at k-la and < PROPFIRST>'s tonight ... <3 them ! 
searching for an april or may marathon in a nearby/surrounding state ... suggestions are welcome ! 
So is it bad I already went and got color swatches at < PROPFIRST>'s Bridal yesterday ? They are pretty to look at , even if I have a good 6 months before I need to begin planning :) 
First day of online class - my computer won't let me download java dev < PROPFEMALE > as it's my work computer and I don't have admin rights . My personal computer is broken . Crap . 
Solution : Bought a laptop today . Justification : Needed one for programming class , mine's been broken for 8 months and will cost more than it's worth to fix , and they are all on sale right now . 
Wrote my first Java program today ! It is a message that says : \My name is < PROPFEMALE > . My favorite hobby is running . My favorite television show is The Office . \ " lol . " 
Omaha headline ... \Man Allegedly Assaults Wife Over Shoveling Duties \"" 
Getting back into running is a pain in the you know what . 
Need to start wrapping presents , not to mention finish shopping . Maybe I'll start on that tonight ! 
work xmas party at the bar today starting at 1p , dinner date with < PROPFIRST > friday , < PROPFEMALE > saturday , christmas < PROPFIRST > and dinner with some lovely ladies sunday , and get to see molwen this coming week :) YEA ! 
Will be reclaiming my porch today . I wonder how long it will take to dig out 6+ ft of snow ? 
A Christmas < PROPFIRST > was wonderful ... need to go to plays more often . :) No school this week and only 2 days of work - wahoo ! 
Better stock up on wine again in case I get snowed in this week . Somehow all of it disappeared last time we got snowed in ... weird . 
Stuck at mom's with a bunch of looneys :) Gotta love family time ! 
Bored outta my mind . Treadmill or wine ? I suppose I could do treadmill , then wine . hmm ... 
Wondering if the snow plow < PROPFEMALE > will visit < PROPMALE > Park today so I can park at home tonight rather than at HyVee :) 
Attempted to go home over lunch to discover that the snow plows made it to our neighborhood and plowed each street ... minus the roundabout and the street that lead to my house . Touche , snow plow < PROPFEMALE > . Touche . 
Huskers today , NYE tomorrow .. Go Skers and Pink Flamingos ! 
Happy new year ! I get to marry my manfriend this year ! Got the Evo and have no idea how to use it ... should keep me busy this weekend . :) 
new year's resolution ... better phone etiquette . 
Goal for the week - paint office , clean car , do laundry , run EVERY day . 
Eggnog tea = Yum . Doesn't taste like eggnog , but it's still good ! 
So much for running every day . We are stuck in our neighborhood once again until the plows visit us ... 
I made it to work today ! Or at least < PROPFIRST>'s Escape did . That means I can run today too :) 
Is it March yet ? I want to be in Vegas with NO SNOW ! 
I've decided that for my birthday ( four months from now ) I want a ladder ball set and a beer pong table . 
Day 1 of marathon training ... hoping this snow goes away before the really long runs so I can do them outside ! The treadmill is just awful . 
Listening to a conference call , and one of the guys sounds just like The Dude from Big Lebowski .

Bridal fair today was good , but kind of makes me want to elope in Vegas . I wonder if I could get married at Margaritaville , < PROPFEMALE > in hand ? 
Q : What begins with \Pro\ " and is awful ? A : Programming . Q : What begins with \ " Pro\ " and is not awful ? A : Procrastination . " 
Seriously though , would my bridesmaids rather go to Vegas instead of buying the dress , shoes , hairdo , etc .. ? :) 
I believe we found our reception hall ... which means we will be getting married in Omaha :) 
Worked out at work this morning . Forgot straightener and makeup - I look lovely :) 
Enjoying some vino with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > to celebrate < PROPFIRST>'s quarter century :) 
First tempo run tonight ... those are not fun , but they sure do kick your bootay into shape . 
Swapped today's run with tomorrow's because tomorrow's was shorter . Have a feeling I'll regret that tomorrow though ... 
Can't wait to get a fence . Gunner dragged me through the ice and snow and peed on the neighbor's daughter's snowman yesterday ... while she was building it . That's embarrassing . 
Congrats to the new Mr. and Mrs. Skinner ! :) 
I <3 Beer tour kick-off at OC tonight :) 
Mindy : A hot lesbian , New Yorker , cowboi that may or may not be related to Kinky Friedman . Thank you UrbanDictionary.com . 
Anyone want to dogsit two very lovable labs ?? ( Please disregard previous statuses about ripping up carpet and peeing on snowmen ) 
Homework is done . All that stands between me and the Superbowl is 10 < PROPMALE > on a treadmill ... Ugggh . 
Leave for Vegas ONE month from today ! :) 
Aurora-ing this weekend and CAN'T WAIT ! 
Well the chapter on Arrays is still intact , so at least I can get today's homework done . I like to think it was their way of wishing me a Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day . 
22 days ... :D ... please go by fast ! 
Going to shovel the 6 ' of snow from our porch and stairs today ... Mol sent a package 2 weeks ago and they haven't delivered it because of the snow ... oops ! 
Well the good news is I ( finally ) transferred all of my past iTunes purchases onto my computer ... bad news is I won't be able to transfer any of the music I had downloaded to my iTunes from CDs ( which is over half of my music ) ... :( 
< PROPFIRST > Our Queens fish fry tonight ! Going for friends , fish & beer . But mostly the beer . 
Going to start off the St. < PROPFIRST>'s beer tour right with a Smithwick's ( my fave ! ) and a lovely bunch of ladies . 
s'more pop tarts ... why must you be so delicious ??

Grilling and running outside today ... I'm a happy girl ! 
Well unfortunately grilling did not happen today because my dogs locked me out of the house for 2 hours . Yes , you read that correctly . 
I'm gonna get my clean on and my homework on tonight . Par-tay . 
Spending the day w/my family and celebrating mom's bday tonight :) 
I hope this year's t-shirt for the < PROPMALE > half is cuter than last year's ... cuz last year's was just plain ugly . 
Just found out the finish line of the < PROPMALE > Half will now be at the 50 yd line inside Memorial Stadium - AWESOME ! :) 
Hoping there's just enough paint left for the second coat ... we'll see ! Happy Easter ! 
I am uber excited for PIANO BAR tonight :) and to see my Molwen who I haven't seen in oh so long ! 
My legs hurt . That's what I get for slacking off on the running . 
I do believe I have a dress and ceremony location picked out ... now I just need to buy/reserve them . That would be two < PROPMALE > checks off the list . 
Woke up to the beautiful sounds of fence installation today . 
Apparently Gunner is capable of jumping a 6 ' wooden privacy fence . 
Hoping we find < PROPFEMALE > today :( 
< PROPFEMALE > update - they found her , but she was attacked by another dog :( Hopefully she will be okay ... mom & sister are heading to the vet now . Poor little thing :( 
< PROPMALE > race for third year in a row tomorrow :) This year we finish inside of Memorial Stadium - awesome ! :D 
Short of goal time by 51 seconds - dang ! Chip time was 2:00:51 . 
Amazing weekend ! Great weather , spent time w/family and friends , 3 yummy birthday dinners , and the run went well . :) 
Trying out the Baked Tilapia recipe from the Iowa Girl Eats blog :)

Just caught a glimpse of my empty camera case in my purse , mocking me . 
only lasted a week without a camera before i caved . the replacement is hot pink :) 
ACI's diner is selling \Better than Saturday night cake\ " for 98 cents . Must ... resist ... " 
Well I found my camera . It was in < PROPFIRST>'s dresser ... wonder how it got there ? 
Almost time to begin the Friehe-Wisecup wedding festivities ! :)

Great weather for a run , and a nice long run sounds good right about now . 
Just ordered our cake topper from Etsy :) Got favor boxes , mint molds , and navy/sangria powder dye this weekend too ! Moving right along now ... 
My handsome little nephew is 1 today :) Happy birthday Drake ! 
Target sent me a free $20 gift card if I register there by October 24 . I had planned to procrastinate on that for a good 5+ more months , but how can I refuse an offer like that ?! 
My nephew learned to walk just in time for his first overnighter at Aunt < PROPFEMALE>'s this weekend 
Got my personal best time in the Corporate Cup 10K yesterday - 52:59 , 8:32 < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ! :)
