I still haven't put up the rest of my New Zealand and Australia pictures ... maybe I should get working on that . 
What I did at work today : avoided going in the pool , wore way too small lifejackets , did all my paperwork , ate cupcakes , colored , and found out that I went to school with \Captain\ " for the last 3 years . I'd call this a successful day . " 
Let's use our bajillion and five Qantas skymiles and get everyone a one-way ticket back to New Zealand . We can go find < PROPFIRST > , and hire him to drive us around again and find < PROPFIRST > and drive around New Zealand with him . < PROPFEMALE > ? I just want to run away to New Zealand and hide there forever . 
One month ago , we were on a plane to LAX , where we would transfer and head off to New Zealand ... -sigh-
