Happy New Years Everyone ! 

I'll have you know ! \ 
That's I've become\ 
Indestructible\ 
Determination that is incorruptible\ 
From the other side a terror to behold\ 
Annihilation will be unavoidable\ 
Every broken enemy will know\ 
That their opponent had to be invincible\ 
Take a last look around while you're alive\ 
I'm an indestructible\ 
Master of war 
soon to board out bird to Guam . Should be interesting . If I don't get to talk to anymore for awhile , it's because I'm in Guam with no wi-fi . Not sure how it'll work . Stay tuned for pictures , nevertheless . 
Well , once again , never as easy as it looks/seems . Had a situation happen to cause us to change plans ... again ... so with that being said , I'm off to work while I'm on \Vacation\ " .. Ha-YUT ! " 
What a freakin trip ! Won't be back in Japan until tomorrow , but wow .. so much stuff , both good and bad , happened . Pictures , stories , everything !, more to come soon . I will say this , being attached to an Infantry Unit is HELLA WAY BETTER than anything could have been provided back in Norfolk , VA . Hands down ! Got to do so much , and even tho certain things sucked , it was worth it and I'd do it again . \Guam Liberation \"" 
There's alot of history in Guam especially about the < PROPFEMALE > Corps . I learned alot and I'm glad I got to experience this . The < PROPFEMALE > s I'm with are f*cking hilarious ! Good times ! 
Just got back from the Gym . I SLAYED my body tonight ... God , I'm so good looking when I finish working out ! Does anybody else ever feel that way ? Be proud of yourself and what you do ! 
Note to self ... get that picture to < PROPMALE > I told him I'd get ....!! Don't laugh ! Like you've never wrote something down to remember ! I have nothing else to write on that I'll check later .. This is NOT meant for people to read , btw XP I'll delete it once the task is done . 
going to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > real soon ! Yay ! I get to get off this terrible base and see a happy friend again :) See something new in this country . I could use the friend to distract me right now ... more than ever . < PROPFEMALE > , you're the lucky contestant in Japan I chose to < PROPFEMALE > out with today !!! YAAAY !!! PICTURE TIME !!! 
had a great time with < PROPFEMALE > ! Where did the time go ?? It is so cool have her out here in Japan with me to get away from this base and everything in , to just leave everything behind , and enjoy each others company . Most fun I had in Japan since I been out here for sure ! 
.. u know , u learn somthng new about u and the way u learn in the most interesting ways . Its true that even a teacher can learn from his students thus making the student the teacher and the teacher the student .. thus learning somthng new about u . My [ student ] tought me somthng unintentionally as I was teaching the [ student ] . Every1 carries wisdom of their own experiences . No 1 person is better than the next . Thank u . 
You will NEVER see me post something on my wall/profile about me being bored ! No disrespect to anyone who does do that , but I don't agree . There's always SOMETHING to do . Don't be lazy & waste your life away , go make a difference . Everyday is a new day and you can't get it back . If you're bored , you have only yourself to blame . I'll NEVER cave to boredom ! I'll make a difference everywhere I go , you can count on that ! 
I have a virtual bruise from Lukensy poking me so much because I'll poke him back ... stubborn mother @#$%& !.... STOP POKING ME !!!! lmao 
The new Linkin Park song ' The Catalyst ' from their new album kicks ass !!! Listen to it ! You can hear their new Single on their MySpace < PROPFEMALE > ( remember that ? MySpace ? Yeah , it still exsist ! [ you losers , making me get a facebook because NO ONE goes on myspace anymore ] So check it out ! ) 
Hiking Mt . Fuji on the 20th ... of course there's going to be pictures ! 
... I'm done with this ... 
With arms up , stretched into the sky \ 
With eyes like , echoes in the night \ 
Hiding from the hell that you've been through \ 
Silent one , you- \ 
\ 
Go , giving up your home \ 
Go , leaving all you've known \ 
You are not alone ... 
Mt . Fuji tomorrow ! YUT !!! Finally , I've been waiting this whole time ... Too bad we have to ' < PROPFEMALE > Corps'nize it up and be up at 0400 tomorrow morning ... fun day , I can see it already lol w/e I'm not going to let it get to me tomorrow ! Man vs Nature !! * Saw voice * oh yes , there will be blood .... and pictures 
I'm off to Mt . Fuji now . Gonna be a looooong hike ... looking forward to it !!! 
Mt . Fuji Sucked !!! Not really , it just beat the living crap out of me ... But I made it !!! I have the hiking stick that's branded so now I have bragging rights . I'm going to go to bed and post pictures of the hell hike tomorrow . Worth it ;) once in a lifetime hike and I recommend it to anyone who wants a real challenge . 
2nd Degree burns ... that's what champs are made out of ... blisters are starting to form on me now ... 52 marines go to Mt . Fuji and not a single person had sunscreen on them ?? Even Gunny is hurting pretty bad , and he came prepared .. more pain to come as the days go on .. ( Pictures will be uploaded real soon , just had to make some adjustments )

I read this box ' What's on your mind ? ' ... you don't want to know what's on my mind .. it's 2:04 am in the morning here and I'm not close to getting any kind of rest .. been up for 20 hours now and I easily see passing 24 hours ... again ... so you want to know what's on my mind ? You can't handle what's on my mind ... 
What a way to have a wake up call today ... it's like the fire alarm was meant to go off exactly at 7:00 am ... the whole building went outside for 30 minutes ... Good morning , Sunday 
As if the first one wasn't bad enough ... the fire alarm went off again exactly one hour later .... interesting .... Need some good news about me today then ? On the bright side -NO DUTY !!!!!

~ *When I look into your eyes , there's nothing there to see . Nothing but my own mistakes , starring back at me -asking why . The sacrafice of hiding in a lie . The sacrafice is never knowing .. * ~ 
Wow , can't believe it's been 1 year since Kanye West ' took the < PROPFIRST>' lol and you ALL know what I'm talking about ! So makes me wonder what will be at this year's VMA .. Taylor going to hold on to her < PROPFIRST > ' stronger ' this time ? Lady Gaga going to dress in something crazy ? ( of course ) Linkin Park performs live with their new single . Bet < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s going 2 win ALOT of stuff .. and Rihanna .. Eminem too .. looking forward 2 it ! 
I miss having facial hair ... 
That < PROPMALE > Cercone is a silly bitch ! 
Why is there so much hate ? The hatred inside ... You forget who you are , yet you don't care ... When you look back at it now , you have to ask .. \How did it come to this ? \ " ... The path of hatred is many acts .. a journey ... Not a light switch ... " 
~ *I'm swimming in the smoke , the bridges I have burn . So don't apologize , I'm losing what I don't deserve ... what I don't deserve* ~ 
~ *I know what it takes to move on , I know how it feels to lie . All I want to do , is trade this life for something new . holding on to what I haven't got* ~ 
I'm a lie .. 
I've been at war with < PROPFEMALE > Pintor and Parysusy Rodriguez for MONTHS now , and they won't let up !! Everyone else quit already . THEY threw in the towl >:/ I swear , as soon as I get back I'm going mess BOTH of you up and take your lunch money for not claiming me as the LAST poker ! 
Parysusy Rodriguez you suck !!! I've never got this kind of attention before ... but I'm still going to spam your profile ... that's what TRUE friends do >:) But we created this first so if anyone else starts this , we know who did it first .... buncha biters !! lol 
~ *God bless us everyone , We're broken people living under a loaded gun , And it can't be outfought -it cant ' be outdone -it can't be outmatched -it can't be outrun -No ! God save us everyone , Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns ? For the sins of our hands , the sins of our tongues , the sins of our father , the sins of our young* ~ 
If you wrote a book about your life , would anyone want to read it ... 
I miss my family . The sad part is , not my immediate family * Except < PROPMALE > ! I miss him * the very small family I never got to see as much due to certain circumstances . I look at their profiles now to see how they have grown and it makes me teary . Sugar Aubreys , < PROPFEMALE > Rhee I miss you 2 so much ! No matter how far the military takes me , I promise I'll see you soon .

Off to Tokyo ! 
Boy falls in love with girl , girl falls in love with boy , boy gets girl pregnet , girl loses baby ... boy becomes serial killer ? Something's not adding up here ... 
~ *I shiver and shake the warm air cold , I'm alone .. on my own . In every mistake I did this all , through my skin .. and bones . It's harder starting over , than never to have changed -with blackbirds following me , I'm digging up my grave . They close in , swallowing me . The pain , it comes in waves . I'm getting back what I gave . * ~

It's strange what < PROPFEMALE > will make foolish people do\ 
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you\ 
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you\ 
No , I don't wanna fall in love\ 
( this world is only gonna break your heart)\

There's gotta be more to life than being really , REALLY , ridiculously good looking !.... but what ? 
I believe I've found a new calling for me . I wish to start a non-profit organization that helps support single parents and their kids . I've noticed enough single parents that don't have all the essentials for their children . Being raised by a single parent , I know EXACTLY what my dad went through . I do not wish for anyone else to go through what I had to . I've always felt like I can do more for others ... this is it ! 
One day , I'll know why I was put here . Until that day , as I continue searching for my place in this world , I will give my best to make a difference for someone/something . That's all one can ask for , honestly . 
I look good .... really good .... HEY EVERYONE !!!! COME SEE HOW GOOD I LOOK !!! 
Today is my father-in-law's 2 year anniversary of his passing . Tho he wasn't my father-in-law at the time , the family is my family now . Today's not an easy day for them , which doesn't make it an easy day for me . I remember the day just like they do . Besides my wife , my mother and little sister are having a hard day . I'm sorry I can't be there for you 3 today .. I wish I could be there now but soon . I love you guys .

Pride\ 
In almost every list Pride is considered the original & most serious of the 7 deadly sins , & the source of the others . It is identified as a < PROPFEMALE > to be more important or attractive than others , failing to acknowledge the good work of others , & excessive love of self . The story of Lucifer , pride ( his < PROPFEMALE > to compete with God ) was what caused his fall from Heaven , & his resultant transformation into Satan . 
... can't . Only too much before someone breaks . 
Actually done with work early today ... home now ( I'm tired ) 
God , I'm so sick .... I can't even sleep , I'm so sick ... F**king CTF in the snow got me sick ... I can't even eat or I'll throw up . ( Just go away ! )
