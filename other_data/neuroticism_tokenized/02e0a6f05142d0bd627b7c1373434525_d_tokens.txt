Got the replacement phone ether txt or msg me ur number

I hate that feeling when you're about to cry and someone asks you if there's anything wrong or to cheer up and you try to smile , but you just physically can't do it and eventually the effort of trying to smile for this one person has the tears spilling over . It makes me feel so defeated by life when I can't find the strength to smile in those moments . 
playing a game on soompi haha its fun and interesting . the exchange student is going to b coming i cant wait til we can at least talk to her 
When you look at a person , any person , remember that everyone has a story . Everyone has gone through something that has changed them . 
who's all going to the game tomorrow ??? 
Im writing to Miu , idk wat to say but im so exsited 
Have you ever felt a storm of emotions within ur soul ? The unimaginable phone call from a doctor in which the precious life that was created is in the balance between life and death . Percentages and medical statistics now ring in ur ears as the tears well up inside , tears that continuously flow as you think the unthinkable about your babys diagnosis . As the walls of hope seem to close in on you , where do you turn ? 
uhhh I'm acually really starting to think that I wont be able to be an exchange student for 11th grade . Looking at the scholerships im not even gonna have a < PROPMALE > , I might be able to senior year but idk if i wonna graduate their and not be able to have my familly their . But it's on now , Idc when but im going to somewhere else . If i get an A in all my subjects next quarture I have a < PROPMALE > of getting a 3.0 average . 
People got to learn , things arent just about ur happiness . If u make a bad choose ur not only affecting ur life but a lot of other peoples , especially when u have kids . My whole life ive said i dont wat kids , every little thing u do when u have a kid effects their whole lives . Your happiness , ur sanity , ur passion dont matter anymore . You cant just take ur kids from their home , from their lifes because ur NOT HAPPY ! 
“Our relationship has already been formed . No matter how trivial a meeting and the incidents that follow may seem , a relationship is made . Even if it is just for a short amount of time , a knot that has been tied does not unravel . It means that during your lifetime , every incident that passes has meaning . The meeting between you and I also has meaning , so remember it . ” 
i always thought he was best for u but .. after seeing you tormenting yourself like this , i realized i was wrong . u should let him go . you need someone who truly loves you , someone who will protect you and care for you . and , you probably know that such a person has and will always be by your side . 
you may condemn me with your bitter words and untouchable rage you may torment me ' Cause I don't lead my life in your way . But I will stand here before you with no pride or prejudice , just steadfast and certain that I will land on my own two feet you think you can break me bring my head down to my knees but my power will defy you when my heart's on my sleeve 
I've always counted all my blessings knowing you'd defend me and stand by my side . If only I didn't lose my senses . I always read the last < PROPFEMALE > instead of the first . :( 
When they pull you too far you must learn to forgive and you must ask your heart , Will I lose a friend ? Striving to contend . Will I destroy this trust when I want the best for us ? Should I hold your hand no matter what you plan ? 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a\ 
sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as \ 
your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you \ 
do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people \ 
won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some \ 
point in our lives . Show your support good people . I copied and pasted , \ 
will you ? 
I've been a puppet , a pauper , a pirate , a poet , a pawn and a king\ 
I've been up and down and over and out\ 
And I know one thing\ 
Each time I find myself layin ' flat on my face\ 
I just pick myself up and get back in the race\ 
-Westlife : That's Life

Got a myyearbook let me kno if u got one or if u wonna see my boyfriend then let me kno and ill give u the link to his profile so u can talk to him urself lol :) 
B like water making its way through cracks . Do not b assertive , but \ 
adjust to the object , and u shall find a way round or through it . If \ 
nothing within u stays rigid outward things will disclose themselves . \ 
Empty urmind b formless . Shapeless like water . If u put water \ 
into a cup it becomes the cup . U put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot . Now \ 
water can flow or it can crash . 
hacked by < PROPMALE > hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Sei : love simply isn't enough No matter how strongly you \ 
feel that love It may just not be enough After all there is no \ 
place on earth where strong feelings alone are automatically rewarded\ 
Sub :\ 
Then why do people love at all ? If love is useless what use could we \ 
have for such an emotion ? \ 
Sei : Because were lonely As long as\ 
we can love we can dream Human beings aren't strong enough to live \ 
without their dreams . 
I just got home like an hour ago . I had so much fun with the family and < PROPFIRST > didnt hit me at all :) so it was amazing . There was no drama at all and it was good to see everyone that I never really get to c . Hopefully I get to see them at marely's wedding though

it . 
reading history of love but just parts of it though and it makes me feel all special and i cried when < PROPFIRST > Gursky dead :\ ( " 
\The idea of evolution is so beutiful and sad . Since the earliest life \ 
who even cares about sex ?! Ppl act like \ 
its the most important thing humans do but come on . How can ur whole live revolve around something slugs can do . I \ 
mean who u want to screw nd rether u screw them ? Those are \ 
important questions but theyre not that important . U know \ 
whats important ? Who u would die for ? Who do u wake up at five \ 
fortyfive in the morning for even though u don’t even know why he \ 
needs u ? 
“Every time she tries to leave , knowing it’s what has to be done , the \ 
boy stops her , begging like a fool . And so she always returns , no matter\ 
how often she leaves or how far she goes , appearing soundlessly behind \ 
him and covering his eyes with her hands , spoiling for him anyone who \ 
could ever come after her . ”\

— < PROPFEMALE > Krauss , The History of Love 
Sometimes u have to be strong for urself . You have to know that ur a good person and a good friend . Whats meant to be will end up good and whats not wont . Love is worth fighting for but sometimes u cant be the only one fighting . At times people need to fight for u . If they dont , u just have to move on and realize what u gave them was more than they were willing to give u . Always fight until u cant anymore . 
I guess when you really love someone , unconditionally .. You won’t care what they do to you ; positive or negative . You see past their mistakes and faults . You’ll still want and need them no matter what obstacles you have to go through . You’re determined to fight for what you deserve . You will never stop trying or give up . Enough is never enough . 
So like my status ill tell you what i \like\ " about you "

We're like alarm clocks . When the time is right , sparks would fly and a < PROPFEMALE > would ring in our head but only for us to hear , telling us that it'll work out . When time is slowly ticking away , waiting for it to change its hours ; we cling desperately onto memories of when the sparks did exist . And when the battery runs out and time stops , so do we . We stop clinging onto memories and sadly , that's it . That's our ending . 
today was bad till i got to see my best friend in the whole entire world <3 :) < PROPFIRST > Gay-j Coulson tomorrow should be fun haha :)
