When a tornado meets a volcano\ 
All I know is\ 
I love you too much\ 
Don't you hear sincerity\ 
In my voice when I talk\

I have of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custom of exercises ; and indeed , it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame , the earth , seems to me a sterile promontory ; this most excellent canopy , the air , this brave o’erhanging firmament ... it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours\ 
Something is rotten in the state of MICHIGAN
