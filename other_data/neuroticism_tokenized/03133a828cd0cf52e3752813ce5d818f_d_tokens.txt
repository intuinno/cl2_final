thinks that when you have two tone hair , and someone asks you about it , you should not start talking about your performance/game plan etc . And you should especially NOT refer to yourself in the third person while doing it

Tough Mudder was awesome !! But on to the next thing ... Amanda ... anyone else in tomorrow afternoon ? 
... Heaving against every fiber of their being , a living war cry in the face of adversity . They overcome through sheer exertion of will . Shattering the fallacy of the immovable object by becoming the unstoppable force . Belief is a place where the irrational exuberance of childhood finds new life ... Stop wondering if you can , and know that achievement is as simple as trying , over , and over , and over again . \ 
\Belief \"" 
needs to figure out how to get paid to Crossfit ... take that job in a heartbeat 
You know you are a Crossfitter when :\ 
1 You dont laugh when someone says snatch\ 
2 a nickname like K < PROPFEMALE > fills you with dread\ 
3 no one likes girls named < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , or Jackie\ 
4 you KNOW your totem animal wont save you\ 
5 You are constantly amazed at how much punishment your hands can take\ 
6 You are constantly amazed at how much easier everyday activities become\ 
7 Its only creepy if you look into each others eyes . 
Tomorrow = me bringing a PVC pipe , lacrosse ball , and foam roller to my office . I give an over/under bet of 10 dirty looks while on < PROPMALE > . Takers ? 
Qualified for the Toughest Mudder in 2011 !! Congrats to D-Roe , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > P , and all the other Diablo tough mudders who made it .

Intermittent fasting blows 
Is it just me or does it seem everyone else has today off , took a sick day , or just decided not to show up for work ? I am way too jealous of those people right now .

So many Giants fans on < PROPMALE > today , even at 6:00 am . Despite working in the weirdest city on the planet , you shouldnt break out a lacrosse ball and do some mobility wod work in your seat . People start staring

18 hour days suck 
sometimes clarity is a bitch 
just fell down a half dozen stairs at home , and into an action roll . That was really lucky . 
How do you know you're a nerd ? Watching the Science channel and caling your brother to discuss the differences between dark matter and dark energy and its effect on the universe . 
Why do Crossfitters always seem to have the perfect combination of hot and cool wives or girlfriends - and where do we find these people ? 
Thrusters on saturday and snatches on Sunday = sore ! 
Crossfit Games - Watch out ! Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence . Talent will not ; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent . Genius will not ; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb . Education will not ; the world is full of educated derelicts . Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent . The slogan \press on\ " has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race . " 
Another 2011 sectionals quote : Another quote for Sectionals : Stubbornly persist , and you will find that the limits of your stubbornness go well beyond the stubbornness of your limits . ~ Robert Brault 
I hope I dont run out of quotes before sectionals .... “Success is determined by those whom prove the impossible , possible . ” 
I ate something with gluten in it ... and now I am paying for it . This is worse then a hangover , the flu , and the plague all rolled into one . 
signed up for the games and signed up for Team DCF . This has been a year in the making . Bring it !!!! 
Sectionals in t-minus 11 hours !! 
anybody got the first wod ?? 
DU's on the first wod ?! Happy Birthday , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , and Happy Labor Day to me ! Giggidy . GiGGidy . Goo
