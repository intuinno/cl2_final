The time has come : we're helping to start a community ! 
Put this on your status if you know someone -- or are related to someone -- who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , can breathe tadpoles . 93% of people won't copy this , because they have already been eaten by dragons , 6% of people are sitting in the dark , hiding ; and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post .

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS . . . I am asking if everyone could put this as their status for 1 hour . I'm pretty sure I know the ones that will . Think of someone you know or love who has MS . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour . To honor those who are fighting MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS . Hope to see it in your status :) 
My mom called my name , not my cell . I played outside with my friends not online . If I didn't eat what my mom cooked then I didn't eat . Sanitizer didn't exist , but I could get my mouth washed out with soap . I rode a bike without a helmet . When I was naughty I got whooped . Getting dirty was ok ! And the neighbors cared just as much as my parents did . Re-post if you drank from a garden hose as a kid and survived . 
Mmmm , scattered and covered hash browns and bacon . 
Woohoo ! Just ripped < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > to my Macbook !
