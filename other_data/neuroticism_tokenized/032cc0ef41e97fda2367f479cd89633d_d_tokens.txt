Why return to the world of the living , when the realm of the dead is so restful ? Because when you have something to live for , you'd rather not sleep at all , just to have it a moment longer . 
Sick in the body , Light in the soul , so my mood ... somewhere in the middle ? 
im sitting on the padio 
Great Day , and Night , now hopefully , Great Sleep :D 
Just watched Ponyo ... I'm a little scared now ... perhaps even traumatized

let me whisper\ 
sweet nothings in your ear ... 
Stage craft ... Porque !!!!!

Horray for AVG virus protection :) 
Can't wait for tomorrow to come :) dance class and then I get to see someone I haven't seen all weekend :/ 
ring ring ring ring rng ring r 
Thrilling and twirling , in the midst of a commotion/ Spinning and whirling , dizzy are emotions/ Set your sights on a point far away/If only to right yourself to live another day . 
Had a great day :) thanks to a certain someone who lives far enough away to make days like this rare and wonderful 
work ... yay Oh and by the way , apparently frozen fudge bars work the same as frozen poles , thankfully they melt faster . 
ugh . 
Great day :) thanks to < PROPFIRST > Lentini :] 
Life seems to have this searing hatred of me ... and I don't know why ... 
I can't help but feel that my life will improve greatly when I'm over being sick . 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > Sills CD I bought Sixty Sundaes , Sandwich & Screamery

It has been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and they don't hold grudges . They ...... understand that life is busy ... but you will ALWAYS love them ... Re-post if you have @ least 1 of these friends . ? 
Je T'aime , Je T'aime Toujour\ 
I am forever yours\ 
Sweet Dreams , sweet dreams Mon cher\ 
You're always in my prayers\ 
Softly , sweetly \ 
Wrapped up in heavens arms\ 
Sailing , Soaring Over the moon\ 
Gathering stardust

I'm a Genius ! no , several geniuses a gaggle , a swarm , a flock of freaken Frueds ! 
A pretty girl with the world at her feet\ 
She wrote her hopes upon a paper sheet\ 
She built a bridge of dreams into the unknown\ 
So ready to reap before she’d sown 
... I thought today wouldn't upset me too much ... guess its a good thing I'm working all day , I wont have any time to think or be sad . 
Another day just like the one before\ 
No roses or chocolates at my door\ 
I stare at your picture in a frame\ 
But I know it can never be the same\ 
I wish to God that I could see your face\ 
That we could be together in another place\ 
I wish your arms were tight around me\ 
As we watch the stars above the sea\ 
As the silver clouds move past the moon\ 
I’m dreaming that you’ll be home soon 
American Animes are the best :) teen titan beats out any other kind ever invented .
