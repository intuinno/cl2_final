My Friday is about to begin ..........

Wants a tough decision to be easier . 
Very ... Very .... Very ..... Bored ....................................... 
Yipeee .................. time to go to work ................................................... :^( 
I win . 
Just washed the Durango and checked the fluids . Good to go . 
I'm having the urge to blow money on something I don't need ....... Must .... Resist ........... 
Take Care Now , Bye Bye Then .......... 
Does not want to go to work today ................................... 
Hey Everybody ! ( yes that means you too ) I just got my new phone to replace the old one thats been broken for a month or two . Because it was broken I couldn't get anyone's < PROPFIRST > off my old phone ..... So if you could send me your phone number it would be appreciated . Look forward to hearing from ya . 
Haha Had a good day off ; Re-Organized my room a bit , washed my Durango , and just all around relaxed . 
Thinking ........ 
Anger ruins joy . Steals the goodness of my mind . Forces my mouth to say terrible things . Overcoming anger brings peace of mind . Leads to a mind without regrets . If I overcome anger , I will be delightful and loved by everyone . 
Good day today .... Went to the gun show and bought another gun :^D 
Hates his job with a passion ......

Just got my original wood stock set for my AK ; It will make for a good project tomorrow . 
Has wood stain on his hands ... Things are looking good so far .

Won't give up . 
Fixed the problem with the wood AK stock . 
Enjoys getting phone calls from people that have the wrong number but don't believe it .......... 
Is Bored ........ 
I hate it when things are complicated ....... 
Can't sleep ................ 
I had a pretty excellent afternoon 
1 .... 2 .... 3 .... 4 ...... Freddys coming for you ...... 
I am awesome !!! I went for a bike ride today and totally turfed it ....... scraped up all over and I sprained my wrist or something ........ YAY ME ! hahaha 
Is still hurting from my stupidity ....... but the scrapes are healing and I can move my wrist a little bit , I just can't pick anything up with that hand . That'll teach me to get outside and exercise ! 
Good day off . 
Just got back from a good bike ride . And I didn't crash this time ! Haha . 
As soon as you're born you start dying ....... So you might as well have a good time . 
Internet is back 
:^) 
Isn't good enough . 
Today's been pretty decent so far . I was forced to watch < PROPMALE > Miserables for the first time ...... and it actually wasn't bad . Too bad my day will go downhill here in an hour when I go to work until midnight ..... 
Grrrrrr ........ * wakes up * Its 6:30 .... I can go back to sleep for a little bit ...... * Wakes up again * Gahhhhh ! Its 8:50 !..... time to get ready for work 
When you're a man with a plan .... Got a hammer in your hand there ain't nothin you can't do .... 
Went for a bike ride , my legs feel like wet noodles . Lots of headwind , and its getting awful hot out . The bike ride was fun though . 
Got back from shooting my new gun a little bit ago . It shoots pretty well . I'm pretty happy with it . 
If you \like\ " this status 
Work ...... Blah . 
Tired ..... But tonight was good . 
Tired .... Long day .... Went shooting , rode quads , got sunburned , ate nachos , saw toy story 3 . Time to pass out . Zzzzzzzzzz ... 
Good . 
Has had an excellent weekend . Went and saw a baseball game last night(go Toros ! ) , went to church for the first time ever ( kinda awkward and nervous to say the least ;^P ) and then just relaxed . Life is good . 
I love my Dodge ..... but sometimes I really wonder WTF the designers were thinking on certain things ..... Like putting the oil filter in such a stupid spot ! Its hard enough to get in there but then once you're in there you have no choice but to let oil pour alllllll down your arm . 
Went and watched Despicable Me last night . It was pretty good . And after looking for over 2 months for a suitable new baseball hat ... I found it ! But ..... I was too much of a cheapskate to buy it hahaha . 
Bike Ride ! 
Interesting night , got a parking ticket from the U of A because my big SUV doesn't fit into prius sized parking spaces and I was over the line . Ate at < PROPFIRST > Rockets which wasn't bad but it was expensive for what it was . And then kinda wandered around for a while and ended up not doing anything interesting and coming home . 
Has had a great day so far . Went on another bike ride , watched a movie that made no sense , and < PROPMALE > out . :^D Work soon though , so that sucks . haha . 
Had an AWESOME Saturday morning ! I went out 4 wheeling with < PROPFEMALE > and my Parents . Got to play around a little in the mud , my Dad got stuck though . And it wasn't too hot out which was surprising . I uploaded the pictures from today to my ' Durango ' album f.y.i. :^D 
Bike Ride time ! Then depending on how today goes there may be some < PROPMALE > Taco and shopping for some new basketball shorts because * someone * stole my favorite pair ... * cough * < PROPFEMALE > Rozier * cough * :^P 
Just felt like weighing himself after this morning's bike ride , and has now lost a total of 30 pounds in the last couple months ! :^D 
Time for work ....... Boooooooooooooooooooo :^( 
Wants to draw but doesn't know what to draw ............ 
Awesome weekend !!!!!!!! Now comes to an end Zzzzzzzzzzzz ...... 
At home ; I need to get myself a real job ... A career .... Something more than the part time slum that I've got now . 
Light Bulb ! 
Is enjoying his day off so far :^D I got to see < PROPFEMALE > for a little bit and I'm killing time by making some wood grip panels for my . 45 
Gone Fishin ' 
Wow .................................. :^( 
Did not sleep well . 
Long bike ride this morning , stopped off at the house for a break and then went back out . Just got back home . 
\That has to be the whitest ... White part of the eye I've ever seen ..... Do you floss ? \ " Topper < PROPMALE > haha " 
\And now I will kill you until you die from it !! \"" 
Is trying to stay up late so tomorrow .... Errr tonights ride along doesn't seem so harsh at 4am .... And it's failing ... I'm tired haha Zzzzzzzzzzz 
Home from the ride along .... It was actually pretty fun . I felt really awkward and out of place a few times but it was a good time . I'm really tired though , and if it weren't for my iPods spell check this probably wouldn't make much sense haha . Zzzzzzzzz 
Ordered a new < PROPFIRST > Fitzgerald jersey last night ... I hope it makes it here by Sunday . 
Just got back from a really nice little Mini-date/picnic , and I'm feeling pretty good about things . :^D Good day off so far ;^D 
NFL tonight !!!! YESSSS !!! So excited !! hahaha :^D I'm gonna go for the ........ Vikings . Why not huh ? 
Just called in and registered to take the written exam for the Sheriff's department application process , now I'm printing out the application :^) 
Today should be good :^) 
The Cardinals squeaked out with a win .... Wasn't pretty ... But it was a W . Really good weekend :^) 
Wow ...... Cardinals are looking terrible .... Of course it doesn't help when the referees eject players for putting their hand on the refs shoulder to ask a question ... * sigh * there's always next week right ? 
Together together together ...... together 
\Everyday you can get better or be content on where you are at ... I'll chose to get better today . Be great today people ! Faith Focus Finish\ " < PROPFIRST > Fitzgerald " 
Just did some exercise to try and get ready for the Sheriff's physical test ( if I pass the written test I want to be prepared :^) ) Ran on the treadmill for a few minutes ( I still need to run longer ) , did the required amout of sit-ups , and fell short of the push up requirement because my bad wrist was hurting . I have until the 23rd of next month to get where I need to be , so I'm feeling good . 
I had a really awesome day yesterday .... I surprised < PROPFEMALE > Rozier after her play let out with a little present , then took her out to lunch . :^D Then after her voice lesson got over with we watched < PROPMALE > Python and the Holy Grail for the first time and enjoyed some cake :^D 
Everyone else has only one funny bone ..... But I'm so awesome that all 206 of mine are funny ;^P 
Is sick :^( I've been throwing up all afternoon , and my head is killing me .... 
:^D 
Has had a great day so far ! Went to Big Fat Greek with < PROPFEMALE > Rozier and then wandered around the mall for a little bit . Came home and got to watch the Cardinals pull off a surprising win against the Saints ! Now its movie and Root Beer float time ! 
So I took that test for the Sheriffs department 2 weeks ago . And there turned out to be 1400 people taking it ..... And only the top 250 got to move on to the physical test ........ Guess who got a letter this afternoon saying they get to keep going ? ;^D 
Didn't pass the physical test for the Sheriffs dept . Didn't pass the sit-ups so they sent me home . Wasn't told it was going to be timed either , I only had one minute to do 33 situps . There's always next time . 
< PROPMALE > Hall's first NFL touchdown !!!! 
And another < PROPMALE > Hall interception .... 
The Cardinals need new quarterbacks . 
Had an awesome Sunday ; went and saw @ < PROPFEMALE > Rozier in her new play :^D Then we went out to dinner and watched RED at the theatre . I am very happy ;^) 
Got a CJ-5 with 4-Wheel drive and smokey on my tail . 
Had a really great day today . Went out with < PROPFEMALE > and wandered around the mall , bought Doc some little cowboy boots and had a awesome burger for lunch . I am a lucky man :^D 
I had another amazing day today :^D < PROPFEMALE > and I went to Tombstone ( her first time ) wandered around and checked out the neat stuff , ate a Hawaiian pizza in Big Nose < PROPFEMALE>'s ( seems kinda weird eating Hawaiian pizza in a historical old west saloon ... But it was good ) . Then drove home and just relaxed on the couch watching movies together . Perfect ! I am amazingly happy and lucky ;^D 
Happy thanksgiving to all ! And too all a goo ....... Wait ... Wrong holiday ... Happy thanksgiving anyway ;^D 
Just saw the Jazz beat the lakers .... :^D :^D :^D nice little tidbit to learn before falling asleep .. Zzzzz 
My Dad and I ran some of the sprayable sea-foam through the Durango . It's still running a bit rough but it's 10 times better than it was . Probably gonna run the second half of the can through tomorrow . :^) 
Utah Jazz won again tonight ! that's seven straight bringing them to 15-5 on the season :^) at least one of my teams is playing well 
Awesome day off ;^D now .... Zzzzzz
