Homeless go without eating .... Elderly going without needed medicines ,,,, Mentally ill without treatment .... Troops without proper equipment .... Yet we donate millions to other countries before helping our own first .... 99% of people on facebook won't have the guts to ... repost ... this !!!!! Will you ?

Spent all day yesterday trout fishing with my son < PROPFIRST > on Mad river fishing for brown Trout with flyrods . We caught a few fish saw a mink and i had a deer just about run over me in mid stream < PROPFEMALE > it crossed . snow on ground , air and water was cold and wading was great . \that day was price less \"" 
Heavenly Father , as we embark upon this a new year , walk through my home and take away all my worries and any illnesses ; and please watch and protect my family and friends . In Jesus name , Amen . This prayer is so powerful , stop what you're doing & set this to your status . Watch what He'll do !! Believe 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE ... Getting back up is LIVING ~ Re-post if you agree ~ ~

< PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 are all US military who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status . ~ repost and give them honor they deserve 
I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family and my friends will . Think of someone you know or love who has or had cancer . My prayer is that I hope a cure will be found . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . Love & Thanks
