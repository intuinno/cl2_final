That's the thing about depression : A human being can survive almost anything , as long as she sees the end in sight . But depression is so insidious , and it compounds daily , that it's impossible to ever see the end . The fog is like a cage without a key . -- < PROPFEMALE > Wurtzel

Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts . -- < PROPFIRST > Einstein 
Hiding in my room , safe within my womb , I touch no one and no one touches me . I am a rock , I am an island . And a rock feels no pain ; And an island never cries . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > From song I Am a Rock

I can't get Christmas carols out of my head !

One more day of school then I'm off until the 3rd . Woohooo ! 
\Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night \"" 
HAPPY NEW YEAR ! I'm off to blow stuff up . 
In the market for a car . Lost the old one because of a dog . Take my advice - hit the dog . 
Now State Farm says they haven't decided it was totaled because they haven't gotten the info from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s Collision Dept ( they have the fit ) and we should know Monday or Tuesday . Anyone want the hair I am pulling out of my head ? 
Went car shopping today . The kids are trying to talk us into two cheap cars instead of one almost new one . Got 6 total possibilities now - 2 for < PROPFIRST > ( 05 Tribute 3.0 or 98 Lexus ES 300 ) , 2 for Will ( 03 < PROPFEMALE > Gl 1.8 T or 03 Mustang coupe ) and 2 for both ( 10 Elantra GLS or 08 < PROPFEMALE > Wolfsburg ) . \ 
Now the insurance company just needs tell us if the Fit is totaled and if it is , what we are getting for it . 
Finally got the check from the insurance company and two \new\ " cars . " 
The kids are leaving me again . Will left a few hours ago . < PROPFIRST > is leaving in the morning . :( 
Last week of 5th mod . Doing Obstetrics and Pediatrics this week . 6th mod starts next Monday . 
The \fun\ " mod starts tomorrow . Rehabilitation and therapy . " 
So far in this mod I've learned about range of motion , massage therapy , and today we dipped our hands in hot wax . This is definitely better than drawing blood ! 
Missing my Alienware . It wouldn't run on battery so it went back to get fixed . :'( 
If you are not part of the solution , you are part of the precipitate . - Horforia Zenro 
Because of all that snow last week I have to go to school tomorrow . :( 
Only 2 more days of Mod G then it's off to X-Ray !!! YAY !!!!!!!!!!! 
Start X-Ray tomorrow . FINALLY ! 
A-Ray is going to be FUN FUN FUN !!!!!! This mod lasts 8 weeks . 
No one has been able to explain to me why young men and women who serve in the U.S. Military for 20 years , risking their lives protecting freedom , and only get 50% of their base pay . While politicians hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital , protected by these same men and women , and receive full pay retirement after serving 1 term ! Re-post if you believe this is absolutely WRONG !! 
Banana
