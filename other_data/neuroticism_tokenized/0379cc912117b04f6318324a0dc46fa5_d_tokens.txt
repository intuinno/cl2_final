There's another Pirates of the Caribbean coming in 2011 !!! 
has decided she does not need a man or children to screw up my life . I have learned to be content in my circumstances . 
My car broke on me Again ! I could still drive it ( it drove fine and nothing sounded funny ! ) so hopefully it won't be expensive or the warranty will cover it ! And < PROPFEMALE > had surgery earlier and is doing fine . They found that her appendix was fine but took it out anyway . Bad news though , they found that her intestine was swollen but they don't know why . So she at Stevens until Friday . 
The warranty is covering most of the costs . I haveto pay 300 plus tax . Bad news , I have a bubble in my tire .... Which means I get to spend money I don't have ..... And I have to move in two weeks . Life is great .... 
If anyone has an extra room or knows someone who does , will you let me know ? I need a place ASAP , but I don't have much money .... I'd be really grateful ! 
My head hurts ... ugh !

When Jesus died on the cross he died for YOU and me . If you are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ , copy and repost . I am not . 
I think we could reduce the number of cars on the road by limiting the number of stupid people who have driver's licenses and do not know how to drive their vehicle in an assertive and alert manner . Or those who get ticketed for driving while texting or using your cell should have their licenses revoked . 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland 3D !! 
Do I work at applebee's ?? No , I live there ..... 
Is wondering what would have happened if I'd made some very different decisions in my life .... I don't regret them , but I'm curious as to what it would look like . 
Wake up , look around Just before you're feet hit the ground Where they make the oil and street Is where you stand and where you sleep Black and whites along the lights Plain clothes and < PROPFEMALE > Rights At the right place but in the wrong life Somedays just ain't so easy

You groped your way through that murk once , but no longer . You’re out in the open now . The bright light of Christ makes your way plain . So no more stumbling around . Get on with it ! Ephns . 5:8 ( The Message ) 
I did it !! Take that Satan !!

Why is it that every time I'm really attracted to a guy , I end up acting like an idiot and super shy ??? I'm so frustrated with myself ! 
Had an awesome night out with the ladies and gents !! 
But if God himself has taken up residence in your life , you can hardly be thinking more of yourself than of him . Anyone , of course , who has not welcomed this invisible but clearly present God , the Spirit of Christ , won’t know what we’re talking about . But for you who welcome him , in whom he dwells—even though you still experience all the limitations of sin—you yourself experience life on God’s terms . 
I will not compromise my values for ANY man ( or person ) . And if that means I stay an unmarried virgin for the rest of my life , so be it . Jesus means more to me than anything else in this world and if He doesn't want me to be married than I won't get married or have sex . 
I wish I was good at relationships but I'm not . 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They want what we all want : to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Could you do it and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It's Special Education Week , this is to all the children who need a little extra help and understanding .

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . ........... Repost if u have at least one true friend . They will know who they are ;) 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never met , or those we held but could not take home or the ones thatcame home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby 
To all my applebuddies ( current and former ): Tomorrow we are having a little surprise cake/ semi-party for < PROPMALE > at bothell applebee's around 8 pm if you can make it . Obviously , please do not tell him that you are coming . thanks ! 
I want ice cream with pretzels for a topping . I am weird ?? 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do , in honor of someone who died of or is fighting cancer . 
I do not own even a modicum of < PROPFEMALE > .
