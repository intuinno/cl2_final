Three-score barrels of powder below\ 
To prove old England's overthrow ;\ 
By God's providence he was catch'd ( or by God's mercy)\ 
With a dark lantern and burning match .

A soul to dig the hole much deeper\

Brining dem turkeys . 
Happy Thanksgiving people ! What are you thankful for ? 
Off to my uncle's for Thanksgiving . Wish me luck ! 
Mission Accomplished ! I am now going to ' liberate ' ' Christmas ' . 
Today was a day of extremes . Greatest Thanksgiving meal I have ever had , hardest I've laughed , and the most likely I was to pass out at a social event without the help of drugs . 
Disturbing dreams . Though I did go lucid at one point ! :D / : 
I'm pretty sure last night was the last time I will ever dex . That was bad . 
All that is exciting and enjoyable in my life happens in my sleep . 
I'm still sending out cookies but you'll have to message me your address because I no long have access to /sb/ . 
Leftover ham , goat cheese , and dijon go together much better than I expected . 
Amazing dreams last night ! It seems the more I hate my waking life the better they get . Special thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > for their guest appearances . 
I believe I can see the future . Because I repeat the same routine . 
Downloading some of Herbie Hancock's stuff . Only like 4 gigs though . Lossy too . \ 
Damn , prolific artists . 
Greasemonkey is amazing . Why am I just now discovering this ? 
But who needs love when there's Law and Order ? \ 
And who needs love , when there's Southern Comfort ? \ 
And who needs love at all ? 
Ugh why was I sleeping on my computer and how did I kill a bottle of whiskey AND wine . 
< PROPFEMALE > Online is ridiculously addicting and amazing and I rue the day I picked it up . 
Just got spontaneously sick . Standing in my kitchen when all of a sudden I get all weak and develop a fever in about 30 seconds . Fastest virus ever . 
Has begun the baking process . Should be done by tomorrow , and out by Monday . My apologies for the mediocre peanut butter cookies . 
Ok , freakiest night ever . At the EXACT apex of the eclipse , all the dogs < PROPFEMALE > ted freaking out . And as SOON as they stopped , a giant bat flew over my head . Not even five feet over me , with a wingspan of at least three feet . THEN a shooting < PROPFEMALE > passed right after the bat . I'm confused as to what this means . 
Information travels faster in the modern age . 
I hope everyone's insatiable lust for material possessions and feigned love was slightly quelled today ! Only 365 more days to shop for that special someone ! 
Ok < PROPFIRST > don't forget to take the pie out at 4:15 , don't forget , don't forget .... \ 
6:10 : What's that smell ? FUCK 
Stars are awesome .
