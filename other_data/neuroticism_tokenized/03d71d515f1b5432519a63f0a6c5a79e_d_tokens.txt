Started drawing in Illustrator . I have a long way to go , lol . 

One more week . . . 
Gonna be away for a few days . 
My friend gave me a bamboo brand WACOM tablet . I used it to write this message . This thing is great ! 
\May those that accept their fate be granted happiness . May those who defy it be granted glory . \ " -- Edel " 
\Who is happier ? A dreamer who lingers or one who is woken ? \ " -- Edel " 
\The true value of a treasure is revealed when it is fought over . \ " -- Drosselmeyer " 
No more quotes from Edel -_- 
So why do I get blocked for adding people I know from work from the suggestions < PROPFEMALE > ? =/ 
Paradigm shift ! 
Have you ever had so many things you wanted to do that you did nothing ? Time to choose . 
I just went on a 14 mile bike ride with a couple of friends beneath the clear night sky . It felt great , and was a ton of fun ! 
I just ate a whole , raw habanero pepper . Good stuff ! lol 
At times , my heart does wander . How fortunate to have two homes . How sad to possess but one body . 
Should I be worried if the username \tetrahydrocannibinal\ " is taken ? lol . " 
I love personality tests . If you keep an open mind , you can learn the things about yourself that you can't see , and others are too polite to point out lol . 
Castle age has gotten a LOT cooler since I played it last ! 
Catapult Turtle . . . oh , so beautiful ! 
Today was . . . a good day =) 
Yamada-san , please have a happy ending . 
Got a day shift at work ! Really excited ! 
Just spent over an hour playing DDR on difficult . . . I'm pooped ! Took the regional tournament tho =p 
My first day on days was pretty sweet ! 
It`s another beautiful morning ! 
I had a really good sleep last night - without pills , even . 
I`m getting a swimming lesson after work today . Nevermind I`m two decades late lol 
I interview for a supervisor position this afternoon ! * crosses fingers * 
Highlight of my day : Sitting with my nephew as we thumbed through the \B\ " encyclopedia together . " 
Well , didn`t get the job . 
The week is passing fast . Hard to believe my hump day is already over . 
Played tennis with < PROPMALE > today . Was a total blast ! I had < PROPFEMALE > much fun ! 
If I were to give an answer to everything I know , then there would be no answer to anything at all . 
I have walked five hundred < PROPMALE > and I will wall five hundred more . At Walmart you can walk a thousand < PROPMALE > and not ever walk out the door . LA LA LA LA 
\They made a monkey out of me !!! \"" 
I think it's a good thing we can't smell brain farts . 
Just two more weeks and my days off will be mine again . 
If I can never reach the end of the rainbow , I'll just have to find something else to find beautiful that isn't an illusion . 
The greatest lie I ever told myself is that I am an honest man . 
if you've been texting me lately and not getting a response , i was out of text messages . but i have more now lol . and yay ! my days off are nearly here . 
It's all shifting . I feel it . I sense something wonderful approaching and can't wait to meet it ! 
Just finished a three hour workout with < PROPFIRST > at Gold's Gym . I felt like total crap while I was there , but feeling pretty great , now ! Can't speak as to tomorrow , though lol . 
3 hours of Pokemon Black down . 147+ to go mwahahaha 
I dreamt an anime last night . It was pretty interesting , but I woke up during the climactic battle . Anyway , I love being able to dream in full color and stereo sound . 
I'm tired of waiting for the ideal situation . It's time to create it . 
It's beautiful outside , we're having a cook out at work , and my work day is half done . What a great day ! 
I thought eating healthy would be too expensive , but after doing a bit of shopping , I think it can fit in my budget alright . Making real changes in my life is becoming exciting . 
The door opened . 
proles-autumnus . deviant < PROPMALE > . com if you care to see my novice < PROPMALE > lol 
It's interesting to discover the true meanings to words I've long used yet never truely understood . Perhaps \reading the dictionary\ " isn't such a bad thing ? " 
In the last two and a half weeks I'm down eight and a half pounds of fat and up one and a half pounds of < PROPFEMALE > body mass ( muscle ! ) . Makes me hopeful . 
Uploaded some new < PROPMALE > to my deviant < PROPMALE > . Spent like 7 hours working on it . proles-autumnus . deviant < PROPMALE > . com 
I don't want to be at work . I wanna go home and draw lol
