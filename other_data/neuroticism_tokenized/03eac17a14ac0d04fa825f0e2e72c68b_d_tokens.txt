U'r Looking For Something U Cant Find , If U Give It Up U'll Lose Ur Mind , There's Always Something In Ur Way , But What Can U Say U'r Gonna Have A Good Day :) 

In the end , we won't remember the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends 
This is for last days in the shadows , and to know a brothers love . This is to Lebanon Angels and the rivers of our blood . This is to all of us , to all of us . So don't tell me if I'm dying , cause I don't wanna know . If I can't see the sun , then maybe I should go . don't wake me cause I'm dreamin ' of angels on the < PROPFEMALE > . Where everyone you know , never leaves too soon 
??? ???? ????? ????? ????? ??? ????? ??? ????? ????? 
Dont Search 4 Love Cuz U'll never gonna find it anywhere , Let Love Finds U Slaps U in the face N tell U Yow Bitch I'm here :P :P 
Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute , and it seems like an hour . Sit with a pretty girl for an hour , and it seems like a minute . That's relativity 
Everytime that I breathe , I can feel the energy . Reachin ' out , flowin ' through , you to me and me to you . wake or dream , walk or stand , you are everywhere I am . Seperate souls , unified , touching at the speed of light 
Dream As IF U'll Live Forever , Live As IF U'll Die Today 
Not all scars show , not all wounds heal . Sometimes you can't always see , the pain that someone feels 
Sometimes People Tell U B Like Me 2 Fit IN , Know Ur Identity Is Not In Them , Y Should U Measure The World By Someone Else's Design ? , Dont Let Anybody Tell U Who U R :D U'll Find Urself In U ;) 
C'EST LA VIE , TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT :D 
I hold it true , whate'er befall ; I feel it , when I sorrow most ; It's better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all . 
I'll move on baby just like you When the desert floods and the grass turns blue When a sailing ship doesn't need her < PROPFEMALE > that's when I stop loving you

No matter how fast light travels , it always finds the darkness has got there first and still waiting for it 
joy is just another way of realizing how much pain ur feeling , and pain is maybe just what someone else is needing

One Minute I Held The Key , Next The Walls Were Closed On Me , And I Discovered That My Cast Stands Upon Pillars Of Salt And Pillars Of Sand , It Was The Wicked And Wild Wind , Blew Down The Doors To Let Me In , Shattered Windows And The Sound Of Drums , People Couldnt Belive What I'd Become

Only A Life Lived For Others Is Worth Living 
I Tried So Hard Not To Lose It , I Came Up With A Million Excuses , I Thought I Thought Of Every Possibility , And I Know Someday That It'll All Turn Out , I Might Have To Wait , But I'll Never Give Up , I Guess It's Half Timing And The Other Half Is Luck , Wherever You Are , Whenever It's Right , You'll Come Out Of Nowhere Into My Life , I Just Haven't Met You Yet :D 
U Can Go U Can Start All Over Again , U Could Try To Find A Way To Make Another Day Go By , U Can Hide , Hold All Ur Feelings Inside , U Could Try To < PROPFEMALE > On When All U Wanna Do Is Cry , And Maybe Someday We'll Figure All This Out , Try To Put And End To Our Doubt , And Try To Make Things Better Now , Maybe Someday We'll Live Our Lives Out Loud , We'll Be Better Off Somehow , Someday 
Let It Go , Let It Roll Right Off Your Shoulder , Dont You Know The Hardest Part Is Over ? , Let It In , Let Your Clarity Define You , Let It Slide , Let Your Troubles fall Behind You , Let It Shine , Till You Feel It All Around You , And I Dont Mind If It's Me You Need To Turn To , We'll Get By , It's The Heart That Really Matters In The End . 
When the cold hard rain just won't quit , And you can't see your way out of it , When your heart is full of doubt , And you think that there's no way out , You find your faith's been shaken , You take back what's been taken , Get on your knees and dig down deep , You can do what you think is impossible , Keep on believing don't give in , It'll come and make you whole again , It always will , it always does , Love is UNSTOPPABLE 
The Guilty One Is Not He Who Commits The Sin But The One Who Causes The Darkness 
This Is Where I Lose Myself When I Keep Running Away From You , And This Is Who I Am When I Don't Know Myself Anymore , And This Is What I Choose When It's All Left Up To Me , And This Is How It Looks Like When I'm Standing On The Edge , And This Is How I Break Apart When I Finally Hit The Ground , And This Is It Hurts When I Pretend I Don't Feel Any Pain , And This Is How I Disappear When I Throw Myself Away 
My Heads Aches From All This Thinkin ' , Feels Like A Ship God Knows Im Sinkin ' , Wonder What To Do And Where Is It To Stay , These Question Like A Whirlwind They < PROPFEMALE > Me Away , Who Will I Turn To When The Day Wont Give In , Who Would Tell Me How It Ends And How It All Begins , Im Only Human 
Truth is , Everybody Is Going To Hurt You . You Just Gotta Find The Ones Worth Suffering For 
Dear Agony Just Let Go Of Me , Suffer Slowly Is This The Way Its Got To Be ? \ 
Dont Bury Me Faceless Enemy , Is This The Way Its Got To be , Dear Agony ? \ 
Leave Me Alone , Just Let Me Go , All Blue And Cold , Just Turn Around There's Nothing Left 
Can we pretend that airplanes In the night sky Are like shooting stars , I could really use a wish right now , I could use a dream or a < PROPFEMALE > or a wish , To go back to a place much simpler than this , And after all the pandemonium and all the madness , There comes a time when you fade to the blackness , And when your plans unravel in the sand , What would you wish for if you had one < PROPMALE > ? 
He Doesn't Look He Doesn't See Opens Up For Nobody He Figures out , Narrow Line He Can't Decide Everything Short Of Suicide Never Hurts Nearly Works , Something Scratching It's Way Out Something He Wanna Forget About A Part Of Him That'll Never Show He's The Only One That'll Ever Know

It's Not The Tears , It's Not The Sadness , Not The Fears , Nor The Madness , Some Wish For One More Try , Others Simply Wish They Could Die . 
I'm done with these endeavors , Alone I walk the winding way , I'll live to die another day , Until I fade away , Why give up , why give in ? It's not enough , it never is , I feel it growing colder , I knew this day would come to end , So let this life begin , Living is hard enough , Without Me fucking up , The final fight I'll win , But I will go on until the end 
twilight eclipse best twilight saga movie ever !!! 
Intoxicated Eyes , No Longer Live That Life , I Should Have Learned By Now , I'll Burn This Whole World Down , I Need Some Peace Of Mind , No Fear Of What's Behind , You'd Think You've Won This Fight , You've Only Lost Your Mind 
All Is Lost Again But I'm Not Giving In , I Will Not Bow I Will Not Break , I Will Shove The World Away , I Will Not Fall I Will Not Fade , I Will Take Your Breath Away , And I'll Survive Paranoid , I Have Lost The Will To Change , And I'm Not Proud , Cold Blooded or Fake , I Will Shove The World Away

Nothing better than a < PROPFIRST > Buble song when u r in the mood hope it lasts :D 
... 
All Night Starring At The Ceiling , Counting For Minutes Im Feeling , This Way So Far Away And So Alone , But U Know It's All Right I Came To My Senses , Let Go Of My Defences , There's No Way Im Giving Up This Time , And Im All In Nothing Left To Hide , Im Falling Harder Than a LandSlide , Even If I Lose This Game Im All In , Im All In For Life 
In This Wake I Find Myself , Losing The Will To Resume This Hell , When Every Breath Is A Dying Wish , It's Hard To Follow The Point Of This , The Broken Place That I Call My Home , Has Deepened The Sorrow That I've Sown , And I Can't Erase What's In My Heart , I Want It To Finish Before It Starts , I've Been Fading Away , I've Been Waiting On A Call , So Now I've Come To The Final Sleep , I Hope Forgiveness Is Mine To Keep 
Taking Back Control Of My Life 
Baby Steps ... 
I Need a Little More Luck Than a Little Bit , Cuz Every Time I Get Stuck The Words Won't Fit , And Every Time That I Try I Get Tongue Tied , I'll Need a Little Good Luck To Get Me By , I Need a Little More Help Than a Little Bit , Like The Perfect One Word No One's Heard Yet , Cuz Every Time That I Try I Get Tongue Tied , I Need a Little Good Love To Get Me By This Time 
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean , don't you know \ 
, Butterflies all havin ' fun you know what I mean , Sleep in peace when the \ 
day is done , thats what I mean , And this old world is a new world , And a bold world , Just for me , It's a new < PROPFEMALE > \ 
, It's a new day , \ 
It's a new life \ 
. For me\ 
And I'm feeling good 
When you're heavy like a stone , And there's trouble where you stand , N o-o ne will tell your heart where to go , Or make it feel something it won't , You could rearrange the stars , And make them all your own , But you just cant live all alone 
30-10-2010 a day in history :D :D :D 
Waiting for a sign , Praying to the sky , For love to come around so hope won't let me down , Shadows < PROPFEMALE > on , the light is all gone , Sadness calls to me , Love come rescue me , Is there a hope beyond this night ?, Here before the flames begin , as my passion dies within , As the darkness closes in , I hope the sun will shine again , Bringing salvation to a world on fire 
TO 3AYTA GOING TO SEE 7ASSONAAA :D :D :D :D 
Hover Above My Head And Call Me Out , I'm Beneath It All , Just A Thief Caught In The Red , Hands Dirty From The Crawl , Back To Unsuspecting Victim , Waiting On A Different View , But It's Too Late Now To Change , Wrapped Inside , Holding Tight To The Memory Of Light , Who Am I ? 
Do you know what it feels like to be left behind ? Losing everyone around you in such little time . It's hard to hide behind this frown , When on the inside you're on the verge of a breakdown . I've lost everyone that meant the world to me . All I have left of them are these memories . I feel like I no longer belong . I fake my happiness to show nothing's wrong . 
No matter how many deaths that I die , I will never forget , No matter how many lives I live , I will never regret , There's a fire inside this heart and a riot about to explode into flames , burn let it all burn , I'm running from the light , running to the night , the quiet silence defines my misery , The riot inside keeps trying to visit me , No matter how i try , it's too much history , Too many bad notes playing in my symphony 
I'm at war with the world , And they try to pull me into the dark , I struggle to find my faith , As everything's slipping from my arms , I'm at war with the world , ' Cause I ain't never gonna sell my soul , I've already made up my mind , No matter what , I can't be bought or sold 
damn u msn 2011 !!!!
