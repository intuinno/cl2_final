starting to get way to stressed about the upcoming court hearing with the ex-husband . with every piece of mail received i seem to just get more and more angry . i wonder more and more what i ever saw in him . 
been sick as a dog . finally got my antibiotics so hopefully it will take care of the problem . 
one more day of school , then the dreaded court date with the vindictive ex husband . gotta love a good custody battle . wish me luck !! 
stress , stress , and more stress . i get to wake up bright and early to drive to little rock and battle the ex . i am just hoping for the best . i miss my son so much !! 
had < PROPMALE > for the weekend . our time together was great !! been trying to work out a visitation schedule for when they move to California in decemeber . instead it looks like im going back to court to fight for full custody !! 
dunno if its stress or just being emotionally drained .... i woke up today sick as a dog with a splitting headache and no energy at all . i wish i could just get things on good terms with my ex . I want my son in my life and dont understand what is so wrong with that . 
sitting at home , crazy bored cause my lover is busy working patrol all weekend . dunno what to do to pass the time , maybe ill go shopping ?!
