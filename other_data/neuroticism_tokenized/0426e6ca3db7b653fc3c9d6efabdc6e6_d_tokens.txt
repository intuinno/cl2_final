Come along with me\

But you always believed in me

Surround yourself with what you LOVE , whether it's family , pets , keepsakes , music , plants , hobbies , whatever , YOUR HOME is your refuge

A friendship shared , a laugh , a kiss ... \ 
Ah yes , these things I , too , shall miss . \ 
My life's been full , I've savoured much :\ 
Good times , good friends , a loved-one's touch . \ 
Perhaps my time seemed all too brief—\ 
Don't shorten yours with undue grief . \ 
Be not burdened with tears of sorrow , \ 
Enjoy the sunshine of the morrow . 
Remembered Joy\ 
Don't grieve for me , for now I'm free ! \ 
I follow the plan God laid for me . \ 
I saw His face , I heard His call , \ 
I took His hand and left it all ... \ 
I could not stay another day , \ 
To love , to laugh , to work or play ;\ 
Tasks left undone must stay that way . \ 
And if my parting has left a void , \ 
Then fill it with remembered joy . 
Gossip needn't be false to be evil - there's a lot of truth that shouldn't be passed around . ”

Nature gave us all something to fall back on , and sooner or later we all land flat on it 
If you always do what you've always done then you will always get what you've always gotten ! And the world is full of people who have lived their whole lives without ever having lived at all for if you have never failed at something it is because you have never really tried It is in failure that we have an opportunity to grow Leave that comfort zone and try the limits for nothing is sweeter than a hard fought victory

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is . While you HURTyour woman , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make your woman CRY , there's a man stealing her smiles . Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence

Ever wonder why riders mount from the nearside of a horse ? Well , men used to wear scabbards for their swords on their left hip ( so they could draw the sword quickly with their right hand . If they had got on from the other side of the horse the sword would have gotten in the way !

When you’re depressed , the whole body is depressed , and it translates to the cellular level . The first objective is to get your energy up , and you can do it through play . It’s one of the most powerful ways of breaking up hopelessness and bringing energy into the situation

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete .

If I need to change , I alone will make that decision .
