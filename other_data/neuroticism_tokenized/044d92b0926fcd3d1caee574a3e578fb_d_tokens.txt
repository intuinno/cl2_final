is coloring easter eggs :] 
A smile costs nothing but gives much . It en < PROPMALE > es those who receive without making poorer those who give . It takes a moment , but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever . None is so < PROPMALE > or mighty that he cannot get along without it and none is so poor that he cannot be made < PROPMALE > by it . Yet a smile cannot be bought , begged , borrowed , or stolen , for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away . 
Often people attempt to live their lives backwards ; they try to have more things , or more money , in order to do more of what they want , so they will be happier . The way it actually works is the reverse . You must first be who you really are , then do what you need to do , in order to have what you want . 
nothing lasts forever so live it up , laugh it off , take chances , and never have regrets , because at one point everything you did was exactly what you wanted <3 
... maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back , maybe , you have to let go of who you are to become who you will be <3 
I've been walked on , used , and forgotten and i don't regret one moment of it , because in those moments , i've learned alot . I've learned how to tell when people are lying and when people are sincere . I've learned how to be a teenager , and how to grow up when i need to . And i wont ever take what i have for granted . This is life , live it one day at a time . Because you never know how many days you got left . 
Fish are food , not friends <3 
Nobody can go back and start a new beginning , but anyone can start today and make a new ending . 
skypeee <3 
Sometimes you just have to smile and pretend everything is okay , hold back your tears , and just walk away 
There comes a point in your life when you realize who matters , who never did , who won't anymore , and who always will so don't worry about the people from your past because there's a reason they didnt make it into your future <3

skype with lube the tubee <3 < PROPFEMALE > Forte 
no schooool (: 
< PROPFEMALE > thinks ... 
I reallly need to get out of here ... texxxt itt (: 
I love < PROPFEMALE > with all my heart <3 
It breaks my heart ; it makes me sad to think of all the times we had . You made me laugh and you made me cry . And all that I can do is sigh and wonder why :/ 
remember all the times we've had together , what happened to being best friends forever ? :( texxxt . 
We all lose friends .. we lose them in death , to distance and over time . But even though they may be lost , hope is not . The key is to keep them in your heart , and when the time is right , you can pick up the friendship right where you left off . 
A simple friend thinks the friendship over when you have an argument . A real friend knows that it's not a friendship until after you've had a fight :/ 
Sometimes we need to be hurt in order to grow . We must fail in order to know . We must lose in order to gain . Some lessons are learned best through pain . :/ 
The funniest thing about this message is that by the time you realize it doesn't say anything , it's too late for you to stop reading it (:
