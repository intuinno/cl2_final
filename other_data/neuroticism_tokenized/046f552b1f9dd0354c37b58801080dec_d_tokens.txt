listening to your dad rip up the floor for 2 hours is definitely not the most enjoyable thing in the world ...

everyone's statuses about the last day of summer/school starting tomorrow are really annoying .

Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% won't post this as their status - be one of the 3% and post this as your status . Do it for at least an hour , for those who have died of cancer or who are still fighting . 
aghhhhhhhhhh 
regionals tomorrow :D 
I guess I just needed some more luck . 
Who sets a playground on fire ? stupid , ignorant , idiotic , morons who don't have lives and think it would be funny to burn down a playground for special needs kids . It's pretty shocking when you walk past a park that you practically grew up in and see it go up in flames . 
the amount of chlorine in my eyes is ridiculous . 
< PROPMALE > Monah : \looking at pictures of weed and talking to ppl . \ " \ 
has cuts and bruises . from SWIMMING . 
it's always nice when a teacher decides to give you a test over 3 chapters with 1 day of notice . I LOVE that . 
Special needs kids are not sick , gross or stupid . They only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this & leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education Week , and this is in honor of all kids made in a unique way 
time is moving way too slowly right now . 
is insanely jealous of those of you who are going to see < PROPMALE > Potter tonight . 
if you want to avoid looking as stupid as you do now , I would advise knowing SOMETHING about what you're talking about before you say one word about it . 
well ... today is boring . 
frustrated . 
well this sucks . 
redbull :D 
dgbiodsbgoisbfiosnbsdibg . today was bad . 
parents are SO annoying . 
foooooooooooooooooooooooood ! 
you're pathetic . I will not feel jealous , because I already won . so you can suck it . 
anxious . 
out and about with < PROPFIRST > Silverman ! 
< PROPFEMALE > McNichol is pretty and she admitted it . So never ever let her call herself ugly/gross/etc . kcool . 
the 12 days of Christmas = the worst thing EVER . 
going to go die at swimming now . sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet . 
just kicked the desk by accident . now my foot hurts . brilliant .

shoppingshoppingshoppingshoppingshoppingshoppingshopping ! 
sooooooo booooooooooored . 
root beer float and a frosted fudge cake at 11 in the morning ... WIN . 
Hey , < PROPFIRST > Rohwer ! YOU'RE REALLY ANNOYING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOUR STUPID CALL OF DUTY LAGS . GET OFF LIVE IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM . P.S. It's probably pretty bad that I have to put this on facebook since you don't hear when anyone talks to you anymore , thanks to that lovely game . PLEASE BE QUIET . 
I think going after a SINGLE guy would be a lot easier than going after a guy who's in a relationship ya hoe . 
woooooooooo recruiting ! 
Very sadly , most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in HONOR of all the children who need a little extra help , < PROPFEMALE > & understanding .
