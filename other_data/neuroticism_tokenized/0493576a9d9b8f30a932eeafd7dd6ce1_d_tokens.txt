Happy New Year -- dancing rodents to all , and to all a good . . . . something ? ( And to think I haven't even been drinking -- being ill is just as good , to muddle the synapses . Who knew ? ) 

Feeling slightly better -- was able to get up , get dressed , go to Mom's and come back . But still little energy and near zero creativity . Nowhere near the hypothetical n-word , \normal . \"" 
Minnesota plays at noon ; Dallas/Philadelphia game is at 3:15 and the Packers play Arizona , also at 3:15 . I want Minnesota to win , Philadelphia to lose/Dallas to win , and am iffy on the Packer game because it can't really affect either team overmuch , though I'd prefer a Packer win . 
First post -- about JJ Hardy trade from Brewers to Twins . Awful , awful , awful move ! 
Have to admit to a lot of schadenfreude regarding the Packers loss to Tampa Bay today ( Tampa Bay 38 , Green Bay 28 ) . 
I just watched the figure skating ( from Japan ) today with Mom ; amazing what those skaters can do . Now , as for my favorite skater ( among all those skating now ) , < PROPFIRST > Weir -- he took second , and looked far better than his earlier appearance in Cup of Russia ( where he placed fourth ) . He obviously wasn't well , but his triple axels were in good shape , and he only popped one jump . Way to go , < PROPFIRST > ! 
Took Mom's dog Trouble for a ride today up to Milwaukee and back ; he was very good . I think he was more patient than I with the road construction and other issues . ;) 
Boy , can < PROPFEMALE > Boyle sing ! ( Just saw her on DWTS . ) 
< PROPFIRST > Dobbs is going off the air at CNN ! The partisan idiots on both sides who hated him -- why ? He was fair -- he went after all of you alike . Why , CNN ? Why ? ( This is my favorite news show . Boo , CNN ! Boo , hiss , boo !!!!! ) 
Happy Veterans Day , all . < PROPFIRST > was a proud Navy vet . . . my father is a proud Navy vet . My ex-husbands were veterans ( Army and National Guard , unsure which branch ) . . . . their best quality , for sure . All I can say , for all you living vets out there is -- THANK YOU . And for those who have passed on , I thank them posthumously for their service and I promise I will never , ever forget . 
Fighting it out with a story the last few days , and I'm losing . 
Just watched Skate < PROPFEMALE > competition ( on tape ) -- Earth to judges , regarding < PROPFEMALE > Gedakashvili ( however her name is spelled ): She's a C cup ! Triple jumps have to be harder for a woman who is developed rather than a little girl ! 
Packers win , 17-7 . Vikings win , 27-10 . Both Packers fans and Favre fans are happy tonight . ;) 
Took Mom's car in for an oil change , and to get a tire replaced . . . fun and excitement . ;) 
Ridiculous , this Newsweek photo of < PROPFEMALE > Palin , not to mention the content-free nonsense they threw in there ; as a < PROPMALE > Dem I'm appalled . Here's a link to at least one other < PROPMALE > Dem who's just as appalled as I am : http://alegrescorner.soapblox.net/showDiary.do;jsessionid=18FCE763404E4B3E0E83C74C104331D8?diaryId=3763 
More errands for Mom today -- then the usual daily detritus . I hope to be able to write this evening , if my hands allow . 
Yeah ! Got some writing in ( didn't let my aching hands/wrists stop me tonight ) , and figured out a nagging problem in one of the novel MSS . 
Looked over an old story ; I like what I have of it , but it's only half-finished and the rest needs serious revision . Well , that'll give me a project this Thanksgiving week . ;) 
Facebook has lost all my neighbors in the various games . . . doesn't matter which game I play , I have no neighbors . Supposedly it's a \system-wide gaming issue\ " -- we'll see . " 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Packers won Thursday -- can the Vikings beat the Bears , too ? ( I sincerely hope so . ) 
I am so sick and tired of the < PROPMALE > sports leagues in the US of A being politically correct all the time . 
OK , that was the shortest-lived stint in a group in history . Group not as described -- why would anyone want to stop Congress from going into session at all ? 
Mostly good comments on latest story ; still working on tightening the ending ( in my head ) . How to get it to the < PROPFEMALE > is the next ordeal . ;) 
Under the weather . . . . 
Still under the weather ; even money on whether or not I'll be able to get out of bed and hobble over to Mom's today . 
Wasn't able to get out Sunday ; missed Favre's loss to Arizona ( last year Favre beat ' em with the Jets , and Minn . beat Ari . also ; suppose it's Ari . ' s year . ) Will get out today . 
Got out today ; still sick but feeling a little better . Poem up -- see my other post about it -- at Joyful ! online ; first sale of ' 09 . 
New Facebook settings ; hm . Changed settings . Then it says to change ' em again . Hmph . 
Today hasn't been too bad -- yet another new story idea ( when I haven't finished the other ninety-odd ); they don't show up in any regular fashion , I'm afraid . 
Finally , some of the journalists are starting to come around with regards to Barack Obama -- and are holding him as accountable as any other POTUS . About frickin ' time ! http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/31234647/obamas_big_sellout/print 
Minnesota and Green Bay play today -- Vikings against Bengals , while the Packers take on the Bears . Wonder if they'll both win -- and what < PROPMALE > Ochocinco ( nee : < PROPMALE > ) is going to do for a TD celebration . ;) 
Green Bay won ; Minnesota won . But < PROPFIRST > lost to San < PROPMALE > ( was hoping for a < PROPFIRST > win ); Indianapolis and New Orleans are still undefeated , and I was rooting against both . I think that means I went 2-3 ; good thing I don't bet . 
Doctor appointments the last several days ; I also have a few more next week . And I have a job possibility . So it's not all bad , here . ( And seven stories and poems are still out -- a non-rejection beats a rejection any day even if it's not a sale . ) 
I never thought I'd say this , but I agree with < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > with regards to health care reform . See his excellent op-ed in today's Washington Post : http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/16/AR2009121601906.html 
Senate votes on health care < PROPMALE > at one a.m. -- repeat , one in the morning . ( If it were a good < PROPMALE > , they'd vote during normal hours , and they'd not be bringing in 93 year old < PROPFIRST > Byrd at that hour ! ) 
In other news , my sister graduated today with her EE degree after over twenty years of taking one class at a time -- I'm very proud of her . :-) And job interview has been postponed until Tuesday evening -- interviewer got called out of town . 
Happy holidays to you all . 
Dad's Xmas tree looks nice ; maybe I can get my brother to take a picture of it and help me upload it . ( < PROPMALE > has finally made it back to WI . Yay ! ) 
Bears-Vikings game excellent ; Favre played exceptionally well . Too bad < PROPFIRST > Peterson can't < PROPFEMALE > onto the ball ; that's what gave the Bears the ball , and the win . Boo , Peterson ! 
Tired of being tired , sick of being sick . 
Happy New Year to all , and to all a good . . . something ? 
OK . . . just watched \Easy A\ " with my brother and Mom . That movie is funny as Hell . " 
OK -- Minnesota won , and is the #2 seed . < PROPFIRST > won , and is the #3 seed . Green Bay won , and is the #5 seed -- < PROPFIRST > plays Philly again and GB plays Arizona again . Strange ! ( And let's not even get started with the AFC mess . ) 
Bad headache today . Didn't do anything . Tomorrow's plan is to go to the doctor -- again . :-( 
Diagnosis : sinus infection . ( Again . ) Got antibiotics ( again ) . Should be feeling better in three to five days ( again ) . I feel like my life is on continuous loop . 
New status -- two Senators retire ( Dodd -- yay ! Dorgan -- boo ! ) . My niece's e-mail was hacked . And new < PROPFEMALE > fan site thelegendary < PROPFEMALE > Clinton.com has already been threatened by the DNC . ( And I'm still sick but am starting to feel better . Feistier , anyway . ) 
Two more days until the football playoffs start . ( That should help keep me amused . ;)) 
Editing and fixing artifacts that have crept into ELFY since switching computers a few months ago has gone well . Now to figure out how to boil down a fourteen < PROPFEMALE > synopsis into two < PROPFEMALE > s . 
New York beat Cincinnati ; < PROPFIRST > took care of Philadelphia . Who will win their NFL playoff games today ? Only the Shadow knows ( ha ha ha ) . . . . 
Packers lose in OT to Arizona , 51-45 . Did anyone see this coming ? ( I sure didn't; the Packers had the second-ranked defense in the _whole league_ . ) 
And now , in a lopsided vote , Peyton Manning wins the MVP over < PROPFIRST > Brees ; Rivers got two votes , and Favre one . < PROPMALE > and Rodgers , who just combined for 96 points in their game , didn't get _any_ votes . Where is the logic here ? ( Both < PROPMALE > and Rodgers had great seasons . So did < PROPMALE > Schaub of the < PROPMALE > Texans . ) 
Sinus infection still in progress ; antibiotics only helping a little , teensy bit . This is my sixth sinus infection since October ; I am sick of them . 
My newest blog -- < PROPFIRST > Scarborough defends < PROPFEMALE > . God bless him ! http://alegrescorner.soapblox.net/showDiary.do?diaryId=3906 
Put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered or is suffering from a mental illness . The majority won't put it on because unlike other causes and issues , mental health is a BIG TABOO . Break the silence , to support all those that are suffering or have suffered . Most try to cope alone . 
Very tired today ; I also fell in a snowbank . I have to hope Friday will be better . 
Today was somewhat better . Still worried about Haiti/Haitian people in wake of bad earthquake . Fatigue and pain level high . 
Watching New Orleans demolish Arizona ; so far this game has _not_ lived up to the hype . 
Back to the doctor tomorrow ; let's see if they do anything _this_ time . 
I couldn't help but change my profile pic tonight , what with the Massachusetts special Senatorial election -- I want Coakley to win , because I think she'll be a much better Senator than Brown . Too bad I can't vote there . ;) 
After the election . . . the spin . The spin . Watch the spin . . . then fall asleep , cursing the spin . 
On a completely different topic , < PROPFIRST > Weir skated well but not perfectly to take third place in the US Mens Championship on Sunday . I love < PROPFIRST > ; he's funny as Hell and a really fine skater . ;) 
Brewers have signed < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for one year , $5.5 . million with a mutual option for 2011 . It's an improvement , but they still need < PROPMALE > Sheets . http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100120&content_id=7944660&vkey=news_mil&fext=.jsp&c_id=mil 
Women's figure skating championship , USA , on tonight . Watched it -- saw _one_ Olympic-level performance , by Nagasu ; one good one , by Wagner . One indifferent but good technical program by Flatt and that's what won ? Unreal ! 
Bring on the football ! Please ! 
Bad officiating in OT ruins Saints-Vikings game . I think the Saints do not deserve to go to the Super Bowl and will be crushed by the Colts . The refs need to be reviewed ; their calls made no sense . 
The < PROPMALE > Sheets watch begins today ( at least by me ): with which team will he sign ? ( And can I force any more W's into that sentence ? ;) Win baby , win ! 0 :-)) 
OK -- < PROPMALE > Sheets signs with Oakland for 10 MM and performance bonuses . Wtg for him -- but Brewers didn't make offer . What was up with _that_ ? 
Being proactive -- have car appointment ( to look at squealing belts and to get oil change ) on Friday ; doctor appointment tomorrow to discuss recurrent sinus infections ( seven since Sept . 1 ) and general ill health . Wish me luck ? 
OK -- Doctor said my health problems are unpleasant and frustrating ; I have a consult forthcoming in two weeks with the ENT doctor , and antibiotics now . 
Car repair appointment now on Tuesday ; too ill today to go . A bit better than yesterday , though , and I hope to write tonight . ;) 
OK , let's try this again . \The Gift\ " and \ " Changing Faces\ " seem to be going well ; I know what I need to do to finish both . I get closer every day to finishing at least _one_ . But my other WIPs remain stalled out . :-( " 
Ill today -- migraine . But tomorrow will be better . ( It has to be . ) 
Migraine mostly gone ; now dealing with post-migraine stuff . But if I'm slow and careful , I'm fine . We'll see about creativity later . :-) 
Many ill or injured friends to pray for today . ( Other than that , today's PSA is this -- \Hug your friends and/or family members -- love ' em as much as you can for as long as you can . \")" 
Exhausted after several days of migraine headaches today ; slept in , and did very little . Still quite tired . ( I don't think the six-plus months of sinus infections have helped , either . ) 
See Ahmir's note , below ; < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > is in trouble in Texas , and anyone who supported HRC in the primaries ( if they have any money at all ) should send a bit -- if they have none ( like I do ) , they should blog about it . The folks going after her are two male Obama-supporting Dems who don't seem to care that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > supported Obama in the ' 08 general election -- and that annoys me something fierce . 
Re-posting my own update -- still very tired , and trying to recover from four or so days of on-and-off migraines . Very limited energy . Going to the doctor later today to try to get some relief . 
Here's an Alegre's Corner diary for y'all regarding < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > being primaried in TX . http://alegrescorner.soapblox.net/showDiary.do?diaryId=3987 
Migraine specialist said migraine is still continuing after four days -- it's weakened but present . Rx called in for Toradol ( heavy hitter , not a tryptophan ) to take for two days , along with Compazine ( to stop nausea so I can eat a bit ) . 
Better today . The medicine worked . Still drained . Migraine specialist said being very tired is normal after a four day migraine . ;) 
Super Bowl Sunday is here -- my prediction -- Colts 35 , New Orleans 21 . 
New Orleans wins Super Bowl . Yawn . < PROPMALE > Sharper makes an ass out of himself with idiotic post-game comments -- priceless . ;) 
I think I've finally kicked headache . But my sleep cycle , never that regular to begin with , is way out of whack due to the last week's trials . : sigh : 
A friend , < PROPMALE > Brown , put up this < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > quote as his status : Always be a first-rate version of yourself , instead of a second-rate version of somebody else . Which reminded me of my version of it , said by < PROPMALE > in \An Elfy Abroad\ " ( work in progress ) -- \ " I am who I am . I refuse to apologize for it . \"" 
Errands , errands , errands . Talking price of antibiotics down at drugstore ( after their quote was wildly wrong ); fixed car ; got haircut ; brought sick Mom some soup . And that's just the half of it . 
Ill today ; Mom also ill today . I brought her some food ( slices of pizza ) but she couldn't taste it ; her cough is looser , which is encouraging . Aside from that , if you have any prayers , send a few out to former Pres . < PROPMALE > , who had heart procedures done today . 
I must be feeling better , because my present mood is \mad as Hell\ " and yesterday I'd not have had the energy for it . " 
Wrote a little on \The Gift\ " -- looked over some of \ " Elfy Abroad\ " and posted to my writer's group . Doing my best to get through V-Day as if it were any other day on the calendar ; thinking about < PROPFIRST > a lot today ( and every day ) . " 
For my HRC friends ( and others who love absurdity ): an oldie but a goodie written by SusanUnPC at No Quarter -- \Call the DNC and demand a free delegate ! \ " http://www.noquarterusa.net/blog/2008/06/01/call-the-dnc-tomorrow-and-demand-a-free-delegate/ " 
Looking forward to pairs short program ( figure skating ) this evening -- we'll see if either American pair comes in the top fifteen . 
Pairs figure skating tonight -- the three Chinese pairs , the Russian pair comprised of a Japanese gal and a Russian man , and a < PROPMALE > pair are the favorites for the three medals . The two Canadian teams have an outside shot at bronze . 
American pair #2 ( Evora/Ladwig ) second after twelve pairs have competed . They were tenth after short program ; will be at least tenth after long , but may move up . Other pair - bah . 
Two Canadian pairs have skated . Langlois/Hay much prettier than Dube/Davison but latter got better FS scores despite some < PROPMALE > mistakes in jumps and spins ; right now , if all stays the same , Dube/Davison finishes sixth , Langlois/Hay ninth , Evora/Ladwig ( #2 American pair ) tenth , and Denney/Barrett ( #1 American pair ) will remain in 14th . 
Latest diary at A/C -- \Evan Bayh says ' it's time ' for incumbents to go . \ " http://alegrescorner.soapblox.net/showDiary.do?diaryId=4011 " 
< PROPFIRST > Weir just skated exceptionally well , and stands currently in fifth with five skaters to go in Olympic short program . He got 82.10 points -- a few points lower than I'd have scored him . ( Go , < PROPFIRST >!) 
Poor < PROPFIRST > Abbott . His nerves got to him and he's in 14th . :-( Lysacek skated solid , but unexcitingly , and is in second place by a hair over Takahashi . < PROPFIRST > Weir remains in sixth place and is _not_ out of it . 
I'm looking forward to tonight's Olympics , which features the men's figure skating long program . Go , go , < PROPFIRST > Weir ! 
NBC annoys me severely . They have not shown < PROPFIRST > Abbott's free skate . I've read the live blog by Yamaguchi and Carruthers ; I know , approximately , what happened . But the guy is a National champ and deserves better from NBC . Boo , NBC ! 
OK , NBC showed < PROPFIRST > Abbott -- just on tape-delay . But they did show him . And he improved as he went . Good for him ! ( He has an excellent shot at the top ten . ) 
Weir skated great . Judges screwed him over big-time . I do not respect these judges ; bad ice was a problem . Weir should be bronze medalist . Judges should go get f****d . 
Wrote to the USFSA . It probably will do no good . Weir skated great and that's what matters . ( Judges -- bah . ) Weir is a winner and a true champion . I applaud all three US skaters for doing their absolute level best on the Olympic stage . 
I have done what I can with regards to < PROPFIRST > Weir , not that he needs my help with anything . ;) I will remain upset unless/until justice is done , but that doesn't mean everything else stops . 
Today was a down day . Still mad about Weir's unjustly low artistic score ( PCS ) marks . Injustice in the Olympics , of all places , is wronger than wrong . And my health was bad . ( Mom , OTOH , is better now that she knows she has pneumonia and is taking antibiotics . Not that she feels good -- but she's better . ) 
Was appointed an officer in this group a few hours ago -- bless them . Like me , they're angry that Weir didn't medal despite his phenomenal long-program performance . http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/group.php?gid=314766911502&ref=mf 
Up , though I shouldn't be ; prednisone drainage makes me feel weird . I'm going to try to write -- we'll see what I end up with this evening . Might be drivel , rather than _driven_ . ( Or pure -- as the driven slush . ) 
Still having problems with drainage caused by prednisone . Off computer and down for twenty-four hours -- writing was brief but productive . Hoping to see Mom today , check on her pneumonia . 
Mom still way under the weather ; cough looser . Prednisone still has me mostly down ( aside from checking on her ) . Snow here , and lots of it . Perhaps some writing tonight , if all goes well . 
I have a plan to help me get back to playing my saxophone regularly ; maybe clarinet , too . We'll see -- I am confident I can regain some ability with practice , but left hand/arm will remain limited until/unless hand expert can give me better exercses . 
Wednesday must be better ; may be going back to the doctor again ( ill , weak and drained ) . If I have any energy at all today , will try to play my saxophone . 
Bad snowstorm blew up out of nowhere ; white-out conditions . Only three counties in WI are affected , and mine is one of ' em . 
Mom's feeling somewhat better , but I definitely am not . Back to the doctor tomorrow -- today was a down day , with migraine and other associated detritus . 
Verdict : bronchitis . I'll be offline at least a day or so , dealing with this . 
More out of it than with it -- bronchitis still kicking my butt . 
This winter has been brutal -- I'm tired of it . Spring is nearly here . . . thank goodness . ( Still sick , and still tired . But better than yesterday , I think . ) 
Well , this hits the outrage meter -- figure skater < PROPFIRST > Lysacek is going to skip Worlds , and instead is going on ( gasp ! shudders ! horrors ! ) Dancing with the Stars ? 
What a surprise . Down another day with bronchitis . Coughing set a migraine off . Now trying to figure out if eating is a good or bad thing ( as it's been another 24 hours plus with no food ) . 
Doctor says bronchitis is no worse . But I now have a nasty sinus infection on top of it . Switching antibiotics . And I'm finally _off_ the prednisone ( yay ! ) . 
Still down . Saturday was much like Thursday -- awful . 
Real quick thought about the Oscars -- never , ever , for the love of God(dess ) , let < PROPMALE > Bridges speak ever again . Which means you don't ever nominate him for anything , and you certainly don't give him an award , ' cause the man appears to be an idiot . 
< PROPFEMALE > Bigelow beats out ex-husband for Best Director ; first woman ever to win the award . About damned time . 
New/changed antibiotic is definitely helping . Managed to do just about everything I'd hoped to do today , though fatigue is still a concern . 
Four appointments , three days . Went to ' em all . My health remains bad but is better than last week -- if I'm careful , I should be able to do a little bit every day . ( Much better than last week , by < PROPMALE >.) 
OK . < PROPFIRST > Weir is effeminate , no lie . He's probably gay -- no lie , though I don't care . But what does that have to do with the tea in < PROPFEMALE > ? ( IOW , Stars on Ice -- let the man skate in his home country ! ) 
All right . Like TinyBoi , I have changed my profile pic to show my personal support for my favorite figure skater , < PROPFIRST > Weir . 
The current Democratic leadership annoys me at absolute best -- that they've \encouraged\ " < PROPFIRST > Kucinich to vote in favor of the current healthcare bill/mess makes me furious . " 
Tracking House Resolution 4872 -- the Reconciliation Act vis-a-vis Senate Health Care < PROPMALE > passed on 12/24/09 . 
Cortisone shot in right hand/wrist seems to have helped with flexibility . Left hand/wrist will be done next week ( had to have one good hand to grip cane ) . ;) 
Migraine today . 
Health care < PROPMALE > has most of my friends up in arms , one way or another , and no one is listening to anyone trying to mediate . For the moment I'm bowing out of this discussion for health-related concerns . Maybe tomorrow I'll be up to the fight again ; we'll see . 
Please pray , think good thoughts and/or send positive energy to Ace Masters and his family today . His father is in ICU after a heart attack and is in a coma ; things don't look good . :-( 
Ace Masters ' father responded a bit today when Ace played him a song his father enjoys . . . was taken off the respirator , breathed on his own for 30 minutes , then they had to put him back on due to CO2 levels being too high . So there's some hope there , it seems . . . prayers continuing in this quarter . 
Injection in left wrist today was easier than last week's in right wrist . Last injection helped greatly with flexibility and pain/stiffness but of course cannot bring back strength ; physical therapy will be started ASAP on both hands , so I should be able to play more often with far less pain _soon_ . ( Much less type for longer , and not in short bursts of an hour here or there , either . ) 
Hands remain a problem . Some improvement in left hand/wrist from cortisone shot , but it'll be a few more days before I can do much in the way of writing _or_ trying to play my instruments . Right now it's \heal as much as I can\ " and try to rest as much as I'm able despite the pain . " 
Vinny Rottino ( former Brewer ) sent to AAA New Orleans ( Marlins farm system ) . I wish Rottino well ; he's a good player , nearing 30 , and has worked hard his whole life -- I hope this will be the year he gets his < PROPMALE > to shine . 
I hope Vinny Rottino will go to AAA ; Marlins could assign him to AA , which IMO is ridiculous as Rottino has succeeded at AAA ( and their AA roster appears set ) . In other news , the Brewers seem to believe < PROPFIRST > Lopez can be a #2 hitter despite his awful , atrocious , disgustingly low career . 296 OBP . Boo ! 
Milwaukee Bucks lose C < PROPFIRST > Bogut for the playoffs after he sustains a bad injury in last evening's game -- he dislocated his R elbow , sprained his R wrist -- but broke his R hand . Very disappointed for the Bucks ; very sad for Bogut , one of the nicest guys in the NBA . 
Brewers lose , 5-3 , in home opener/Opening Day . Not pleased with Brewers line-up today ; Edmonds needs to sit , and even though Gomez had a great day today he should never bat second again . 
Went to Brewers game ( they won , 7-5 ) and had physical therapy for second day in a row . Am exhausted . More about it all tomorrow . 
Brewers looking pretty good tonight , ahead 7-2 in the bottom of the 5th with the Brewers still batting . Mom at game despite being very ill ; I , of course , am watching her dogs . ;) 
Brewers lose today , 9-5 , to Chicago . It's going to be a long year unless the Brewers starting pitchers remember how to pitch . 
Gateway Technical College ( in Racine , Kenosha and Elkhorn , WI ) has voted to close its child care lab , which has won multiple awards -- they say it's too expensive . I say they are morons . 
Figured out a nagging problem in EA ; also practiced 55 minutes on saxophone ( both on Saturday ) . Hands hurt today but I can handle it . 
My heart goes out to my Polish friends ( emigrés and those who live in Poland alike ) , who buried their President and their President's wife today . Due to the ash cloud from Iceland , many world leaders were unable to pay their respects . Please say a prayer for my friends in Poland . 
I would like an explanation from someone as to why Vinny Rottino , who was hitting . 375 in very limited opportunities , was sent down to AA . He has two triples , for goodness sake -- what does the poor man have to do to get a decent opportunity ? 
\A passionate interest in what you do is the secret to enjoying life ; perhaps the secret to a long life . \ " -- < PROPFEMALE > Child " 
Brewers lose in 14 innings ; Macha fails to PH for Weeks ( 0 for the game ) , Gomez ( poor clutch hitter ) and then it was down to Braun , who flied out . Macha needs to _go_ . Now . 
We shall see if the Brewers do any better against San < PROPMALE > ; SD has started off very well . < PROPMALE > is pitching tonight and he's starting to show some good stuff ( his last start was excellent , albeit a no-decision ) . 
Go Bucks ! Go Brewers ! 
Very mixed bag today . 
Three appointments Monday -- regular doctor , migraine specialist and occupational therapist ( for my hands/wrists ) . Just thinking about it makes me feel tired -- and very nervous . 
Tuesday -- two appointments . Not nervous about either of these , so that's a plus . ;) 
Appointments went reasonably well today ; I am tired of bureaucracy , though , and am glad all the medical appointments are over for the week . 
< PROPFIRST > Obey steps down in WI ; I knew he'd have trouble this year , with anti-incumbent mood _and_ his district being heavily populated with my fellow HRC supporters . Obey is a smart pol ; he knew he had no < PROPMALE > . I wonder if he's finally starting to regret his Superdelegate support for BHO . 
Week was tiring and draining ; so far , the weekend has started off with a migraine . May next week bring better news , luck , or something that's better than this . 
Always aim high , work hard , and care deeply about what you believe in . When you stumble , keep faith . When you're knocked down , get right back up . And NEVER listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't go on . -- < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ( 6/7/2008 ) 
Pulled odd muscles in the right arm after pulling left biceps and triceps in a near fall late last week in the left arm . Both arms are a mess ; good thing I am going to the hand/arm doctor tomorrow , eh ? 0 :-) 
Brewers fans -- look for the groups Fire < PROPMALE > Macha !!!! and Fire < PROPMALE > Peterson , and join ' em today . Someone must be held accountable for the Brewers atrocious play . 
Brewers lose , 5-4 , in the bottom of the ninth . Closer < PROPMALE > Hoffman can't get one single out and blows his fifth save in ten tries . Bullpen is exhausted ; manager must go . 
Brewers losing streak hits nine ; the \fire Macha\ " watch continues . " 
Brewers lose in 12 innings , 8-7 . Team showed signs of life ; good defensive plays ( a few off ones , but not as many as usual ) , a little better pitching , but still a loss . Not as important as extending unemployment benefits or cleaning up the Gulf , but worrisome to Brewers fans . 
Very hot , humid weather here today . Car does not have air conditioning . Ozone warning ; particulate warning . Not a good day to do much of anything but survive and hope for better . 
Still hot and humid here ( not a good day for asthmatics , to be sure ) . Brewers won , though . ;) 
Third straight humid and hot day . Waiting for rain but may not get it . Brewers lost tonight , 5-0 . Still musing about how one writer made it over -- by putting up all the nasty stuff his Dad says about him on Twitter . 
Went to Brewers game Thursday ; they won , 4-3 , in ten innings . Weather a little better but asthma is a factor . Migraine doctor pleased with my health/improvement in that area . 
Two Carville stories about how he's upset about the federal response to the oil spill disaster :\ 
\ 
First is at Washington Post , and also talks about the White House's response to Carville's comments : http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/27/AR2010052704545.html?wprss=rss_nation 
And finally , the Brewers won tonight , 8-6 , despite the starting pitcher , Manny Parra , only managing to go three innings , and the first reliever , < PROPMALE > Estrada , not doing too well , either . And < PROPFIRST > Capuano was recalled from AAA after spending nearly two years out of the majors due to arm problems -- happy days . 
Japanese woman knuckleball pitcher makes her American professional baseball debut . http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-femaleknuckleballer 
To all Brewers fans booing < PROPMALE > Suppan -- what did it get you today ? The poor man is obviously trying his best ; if this is the end of the line for him , you are _not_ helping with your undisguised hatred of the man . 
On this Memorial Day , remember our veterans . If not for them , the US would be a far , far different place , and a far , far worse place . 
Brewers lose , 6-4 . < PROPMALE > Hoffman blows another hold , giving up three runs in one ( count it -- _one_) inning . Brewers send down OF < PROPFIRST > Stern , then DFA him in order to call up P Kameron Loe , who pitched well in his debut ( one inning , zero runs , three-up , three-down inning ) . 
In the past week I've sent out a poem , two stories , and queried an agent regarding my/Michael's novel , ELFY . I also know the story I sent to WotF a few months ago has been received and will be read . Now to see what happens . 
< PROPFIRST > Capuano's debut with Brewers spoiled by Weeks ' error in the 4th ; Brewers are losing , 3-0 , after four innings , with Capuano out of the game . 
Brewers lose to Cardinals , 8-0 . Yes , Wainwright pitched very well for the Cardinals , giving up only two ( count ' em , two ) hits . But if this game doesn't convince Brewers fans its time for Macha to go , nothing will . 
Brewers lose another one , 5-4 , in 11 . When will < PROPMALE > Macha get the ax ? That's the only interesting question left to this season , I fear . 
Quote for the day : All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle . -- St. < PROPFIRST > of Assisi 
Best news I've had in _years_ , bar none -- agent has asked for sample pages for ELFY . And I sent them ; now keeping fingers , toes and other assorted appendages crossed . 
This is a first , and a solemn one ; one of my poems never got read because the editor died and the market closed . Tip your hat to < PROPFEMALE > Labriola , who died on 2/27/2010 , the past editor of the Euphoria Poetry Contest . 
Just sent a poem and a short story out ; a productive evening's work , all told . 
In case any of you needed this link , here is one to < PROPFIRST>'s online Guest Book -- I thought of this today as I signed the Guest Book for < PROPFEMALE > Labriola ( past editor of the Euphoria Poetry Contest ) . http://www.legacy.com/gb2/default.aspx?bookid=2668806 
OK , Agent #1 has rejected ELFY . They liked it , but did not love it -- getting _any_ good comment from an agent is a good thing . I am therefore readying query to agent #2 . 
Queries sent to agents #2 and #3 . Submission package put together for agent #4 ( that one must go by snail mail ) . Mom surprised at the amount of work that goes into getting things ready to be sent . ( What , writing's not work ? ) 
This article disgusts me , and should disgust any highly qualified , yet unemployed , person . \

Been reading many interesting stories/articles on writing , writers , etc ., at the Baen Books Web site this evening . They publish many ( if not most ) of the books I go out of my way to read in the SF/F genre . Check ' em out ! 
Brewers play at CO today . They lost the first game , 2-0 , due to poor defense . Lost the second due to bad relief pitching ( 8-7 ) and a questionable managerial decision in the 9th to let rookie catcher Lucroy hit for himself with the bases loaded and 2 outs . ( He had a nice AB , but ended up with a fly ball out . ) What will today bring ? 
Brewers won , 6-1 , with five-run rally in the 9th . They were 3-3 on the six-game road trip . They start a long homestand on Tuesday . Not sure if I'll be able to get to any of the games this time ( if there's a cheap ticket promotion , perhaps ) . 
Mrs. < PROPMALE > made an excellent speech in support of gay rights , and here's an article about it :\ 
http://www.shewired.com/Article.cfm?ID=25196 
Another good rejection , this one from Contrary Magazine ( where I'd sent the _only_ piece of flash fiction I've ever written , as it's more literary than not and this Web site isn't exactly a fantasy or SF haven ) . I'd rather have a noncommital sale , but what can you do ? 
Eight years ago today ( 6/24 ) , I married the most wonderful , caring , honest , creative , funny and intelligent man I have ever known . We celebrated two anniversaries together before his untimely death ; I've now observed six anniversaries alone . I will love you forever , < PROPFIRST > . 
Brewers win tonight gives ' em five wins in a row . 
Brewers winning streak over ; they scored four runs in one inning today , and none the rest of the game . They lose , 5-4 . Didn't mount a rally in the 8th or 9th . Boo ! 
Brewers win , 3-0 , on Narveson's best start of career -- 8 innings , 0 runs . Axford gets save . Start of new winning streak ? 
Brewers took it on the < PROPFEMALE > last evening ; < PROPMALE > Astros hitters had our pitchers ' number(s ) . Brewers remain consistently inconsistent -- or is it inconsistently consistent ? 
Brewers won tonight ; Fielder hit 2 HR and has nearly tied < PROPFIRST > Hart for the team lead ( Hart also led the NL at the start of tonight's action IIRC ) . 
Got a story into WotF for the June 30th deadline ( today ) -- don't know about last quarter's story yet , but you always keep subbing until you have an acceptance , same as any other market . Also sent off another agent query . 
Just found out one of my FB friends ' fiancée has died . I don't know how this happened , but it sounded very sudden -- it happened last week , on my anniversary . Please say a prayer for the soul of < PROPFEMALE > Wolf . 
Happy 4th of July , USA ! 
Agents #2 and #3 have said no . Have four queries currently out -- so we'll hope for better with Agents #4 -7 . 
Brewers losing badly , 7-1 , in the fourth . Narveson looks terrible ( SP ) , but defense remains a problem . < PROPFIRST > Hart is a great hitter but his OF skills need refinement . 
Had to pass on Brewers game today ; asthma still kicking my butt . In Brewers news , will < PROPFIRST > Hart be a Brewer at the end of today's game ? The Giants want him , and it'd probably be better for Hart if he goes as the Brewers are going nowhere -- but I'd miss Hart . He hits well and I can handle his defensive lapses . 
Agent #4 said no in less than 24 hours . Queried agents 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 . Took antibiotics ( have another sinus infection ) . Brewers lost , 9-3 ; Hart still with team and manager Macha still not fired AFAIK . 
Brewers look good tonight , as they're up 2-0 after two . Hart hit his 20th HR ; he will be in the HR Derby next week at the All-Star Game festivities . < PROPMALE > is dealing , and glad to see it ( he's back after having a scare to do with peritonitis -- the lining around his heart ) . Jenkins retired today , and spoke with the players ; they no longer look like zombies . Yay ! 
Sent out five chapters of \Keisha's Vow\ " to my writer's group this evening . Edited about ten chapters of \ " Elfy . \ " Wrote my first writer's blog post ever . Just another day in paradise . ;) " 
< PROPFIRST > Hart takes part in the HR Derby tonight . He'll start the All-Star Game tomorrow . So glad the Brewers haven't traded him -- hope they won't . Yay , < PROPFIRST > ! 
< PROPFIRST > Hart hits 13 HRs in round one , HR Derby . Hope it's enough for the second round -- usually it would be , but y'never know . \ 
In other news , it was obvious that A-Rod did not know who Hart was before Hart started hitting HR after HR . Boo , hiss , A-Rod ! ( Aren't you paying attention ? Hart _is_ the hottest hitter in the NL ; how could you miss that if you play or watch baseball ? ) 
All-Star Game , happening now . < PROPFIRST > Hart and < PROPFIRST > Braun are starting in the outfield . Yovani Gallardo is on the DL but is at the game as he was named to the pitching staff before he went on the DL . Great way to represent Milwaukee , guys ! 
Agent update -- #5 -7 have said \no . \ " Seven queries/submission packages remain out . \ 
I know it's July . I know it's supposed to be hot and humid in this hemisphere . But I'm beyond tired of it . 
We had rain for about two seconds there -- hard to get excited about , not to mention that it didn't cool the weather down any . 
< PROPFIRST > Capuano wins for the first time since 5/2007 -- wrote a blog discussing Capuano's persistence , and saying that writers need to be more like him . Because ultimately , the only one who takes us out of the game is . . . us . \ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/persistence-pays-off-chris-capuano/ 
OK , the Brewers have trouble with starting pitching , as evidenced by two games ( yesterday and today ) where Pittsburgh , a poor-hitting team , lays 10-plus runs on the Brewers starting pitcher . Yet they refuse to start < PROPFIRST > Capuano again and would rather go with the bums they have ? What gives ? \ 
Oh yes -- FIRE MACHA NOW ! 
Bad weather in SE WI . Flash flooding . Sinkholes swallowing cars . Massive road problems and small \lakes\ " and \ " rivers\ " preclude driving to very many places . We've been told to stay indoors unless it's an emergency . I'm betting federal disaster relief will be needed . " 
Both EA and KV are speaking to me ; worked on EA tonight , got 1900 words and am firmly established in part 45 ( finally ) . Figuring out parts 31 and 32 in KV . Now to think up an appropriate blog post subject for tomorrow . ;) 
< PROPFIRST > Hart hurt trying to make sliding catch into right field side wall -- concrete underneath , and he hit that with one knee and his other foot underneath him . He could've hurt his knee , shoulder , or foot -- or maybe all three -- I hope he'll be OK . Updates will follow as I hear anything -- watching game now . 
< PROPFIRST > Hart has a bruised thumb and is day-to-day according to both Brewers.com and JSOSports.com ( the latter is the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel sports section ) . 
Wrote at least 1200 new words into EA today ; had illuminating talk with friend regarding KV . New short story attempt ( non-Elfyverse ) stalled out . Such is life . 
Heat got to me badly on Tuesday . Took care of oil change for myself and Mom -- ( two cars , but only one me to bring ' em to mechanic ) -- car's AC does not work . Had to go to Milwaukee and got lost on the way back due to expressway being closed for repairs . Boo ! 
New blog about MuseItUp Publishing , which I found due to a writer at Forward Motion getting an acceptance there :\ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/quick-note-about-museitup-publishing/ 
New blog about writing , etc ., called \A Flurry of Ideas . \ " \ 
Doctor visit Monday -- almost certainly have another sinus infection ( what is this , #15 for the year ? ) . Creativity is slowed to a halt while I search for a way to keep breathing effectively . 
Brewers winning big in Chicago ; < PROPFIRST > Hart signs three-year contract extension . Good to be a Brewers fan tonight . ;) 
The worst part of writing -- the rejections . Writers of the Future contest just kicked the 2nd quarter story I sent in ; the 3rd quarter one is a completion of a story < PROPFIRST > had started . As for the story , tonight I will grieve -- tomorrow I'll send it to another market . ' Cause that's what writers _do_ . 
New blog post about bad commercials ; how to damage the narrative . \ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/bad-commercials-how-to-damage-the-narrative/ 
Various things for my Castle Age friends -- a new general , < PROPFEMALE > ( I haven't managed to get her , but I've been told reliably this is how ) -- see comments for details : 
Continued hot and humid weather here annoys the crap out of me . Creativity is not at a complete halt , but definitely at one remove . See FB < PROPFEMALE > for link to latest blog post about bad commercials , though . ;) 
< PROPMALE > Sheets has had possibly career-ending surgery -- had a < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , flexor tendon and pronator tendon surgery all at the same time yesterday , 8/10/10 . See http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/athletics/detail?&entry_id=69876 for details . 
Ill . Will be going to the doctor on Monday . Very sore throat , amidst other concerns . Not the usual sinus problems here AFAICT , though maybe they've just attacked my throat first this time . Will update later . 
Still sick , but a new blog post anyway about the meanings of words and how they change :\ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/words-meanings-and-change/ 
Went to doctor -- have another sinus infection . Antibiotic plus Mucinex in evening , those two plus Sudafed during the day . 
< PROPFIRST > Capuano wins in relief for the Brewers , pitching 3 2/3 scoreless innings after Gallardo had nothing ( gave up 6 ERs in 3 1/3 inning ) . Got first hit since ' 07 ; won at Miller Park ( home ) , first since May ' 07 . Yay , Cappy ! ( Hart and McGehee also had good games . ) 
New blog about < PROPFIRST > Capuano's big win last night ; also about < PROPMALE > Sheets ' surgery update :\ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/22/persistence-pays-off-part-ii-chris-capuano-wins-again-also-ben-sheets-surgery-update/ 
Still sick . Went back to dr. this evening ( urgent care ) . Got codeine cough syrup and a Rx for a new antibiotic as he felt present one wasn't working . Ears now inflamed in addition to throat and sinuses being infected ( both ) . 
Still really ill , but managed to write a blog about music critic < PROPMALE > Rosenberg , and the < PROPMALE > of the professional critic -- trust me , it's interesting ! http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/08/27/the-role-of-the-professional-critic-don-rosenberg/ 
Let's try again -- I've agreed in principle to place my reprints at EQuill e-press , available here :\ 
http://www.equillpublishing.com 
Still not feeling well . Weather is not helping . Really tired of being sick . ( And sick of being tired . ) 
New blog post -- about narrative flow ; what makes a good narrative ? Examples from authors < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > Miller -- and the \Maury\ " show . ;) \ 
Congrats to the newly-married < PROPFEMALE > Chauvin and < PROPFIRST > ( < PROPMALE > ) Stephens ! Way to go , guys ! Enjoy that Labor Day weekend honeymoon ! 
Umpires throw a fan out at Miller Park ( Brewers home field ) -- they've also thrown out Brewers mgr . < PROPMALE > Macha ( no loss ) , Cardinals pitching coach < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( a big loss for St. < PROPFIRST > ) and Brewers OF < PROPFIRST > Dickerson . I'd not mess with the umps -- even the broadcasters are wondering if they're going to be next . 
Brewers reliever < PROPMALE > Hoffman notches 600th career save , a significant milestone -- a tale of perseverance , too , due to how he'd had < PROPMALE > problems earlier this year and pitched his way _out_ of the closer role , then back _into_ it ( at least part time , shared with < PROPFIRST > Axford ) . < PROPMALE > Hoffman's a good pitcher and a good man ; congrats to him ! 
Let's see how much trouble I can stir up tonight . ;) \ 
Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR first name . ( It can only be one word . ) Then copy and paste this post on your wall to keep the fun going . ( Post originally made by < PROPMALE > Evans , with minor emendations made by yours truly . )

My uncle < PROPMALE > is doing his best to recover from extensive cardiac surgery , but it's going very slowly and the doctors are concerned . A brain scan is on the schedule for tomorrow morning as < PROPMALE > hasn't woken up as of yet -- my Mom survived a coma eleven years ago and I pray < PROPMALE > can survive this . 
New blog post -- research is in progress so I can finish up my late husband < PROPFIRST>'s fourth \Columba\ " story . http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/research-in-progress-to-finish-michaels-fourth-columba-story/ " 
Went to move the car in from the street . Little dog is scared because she hates storms -- it's very < PROPFEMALE > and starting to rain . Temp still above 80 , very humid , at 3 a.m. 
Uncle < PROPMALE>'s progress slowed and somewhat reversed today ; prayers needed . Has edema , a fever , and still hasn't been able to take the ventilator out and it's now been about ten days since the extensive cardiac surgery . 
Let's try again -- for my friends at Baen's Bar : how would _you_ go about it , were you me , to let folks know < PROPFIRST>'s work still exists and is available at eQuill ? 
Brewers lose on Fan Appreciation night , 6-0 . I hope they'll win tomorrow for their last home game ; < PROPFIRST > Capuano pitches and he's my favorite current Brewer player . 
Yet another new blog post -- two in one night ! Heartwarming story of remembrance , love , from a Holocaust survivor . http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/09/25/heartwarming-holocaust-story-of-survival-love/ 
Research in progress for two radically different stories -- means I don't have much to say , especially as research takes a lot of time just to sift through before I am able to write anything . Also trying to finish up a story for the Writers of the Future contest ; may not make deadline ( tomorrow midnight IIRC ) but I will _try_ . 
New blog -- about frantically trying to finish story for WotF : http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/furiously-trying-to-finish-a-story-for-wotf/ 
Got the story off . Over 11K words , at least 8500 of which were written in the past two days . Mom let me use her computer to send it as she has a better Word program than I do ; now , I wait . 
New blog about two new book reviews I wrote for Shiny Book Reviews ; < PROPFEMALE > Weir's historical \Queen Isabella\ " and < PROPFIRST > Schaffer's pointed satire \ " One Nation Under Dog : < PROPFEMALE>'s Love Affair with our Dogs . \ " Check it out ! \ 
Went to ER Monday night due to weakness and pain in left arm that radiated all the way up into the neck . Somehow I strained something ; I have to take more muscle relaxants and have a Rx for T-3s sitting in my purse . Oh , and I'm supposed to rest . ( Easier said than done . ) 
I hate pain meds , even weak ones , because I have trouble writing when I'm on ' em . I can edit but not write ; all writing projects on hold while I continue to do my best to heal . 
My brother-in-law , < PROPFIRST > Caffrey , died last evening ( I was just informed ) . He was 53 and had suffered for many years with full-blown AIDS . I hope he'll find peace in eternity and be reunited with his lover , who predeceased him by at least ten years . 
New blog post -- a bunch of stuff , including new publication announcements , the Yoplait yogurt save lids stuff , and a < PROPFIRST > Favre observation . \

My Uncle < PROPMALE > needs prayers , folks . He's not recovering well from his extensive cardiac surgery ; he doesn't remember my Aunt ( his wife ) most of the time and is totally confused . He may have had a stroke ( or a series of smaller ones ) during the long surgery -- recovery time will take months , minimum . Please keep him and my Aunt < PROPFIRST > in your prayers . 
I was unclear before on how much my uncle < PROPMALE > understands ; it's less than I had thought . Please keep praying . 
A happy event -- Sec . of State < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s birthday is today . I hope she has a special day . \ 
A sad event -- a friend of mine , < PROPFIRST > Strawnsky , passed away at age 73 . I wrote a blog , an elegy , about what I remember about < PROPFIRST>'s life :\

A tornado touched down in Mount Pleasant not one mile from my father's home . Much damage . No deaths , two injuries . Grateful it wasn't worse ; WI state highway 11 shut down until midnight to clean up debris . Power was out nearly 4 hours . 
Via < PROPFIRST > Bunts : A true friend doesnt care if you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is messy , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies , because they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . ( Repost at your own risk . ;)) 
Windstorm outside . Windstorm _inside_ . A completely frustrating , vexation-filled day . 
Thursday was a write-off day . Down for the count with one of the worst migraines of the year . Friday _must_ be better . 
Migraine cleared after 36 hours . Friday afternoon/evening was better . Hoping to be able to write tomorrow . 
And now , we find out that < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > has likely held on to his seat in < PROPFEMALE > -- < PROPMALE > has been the weakest Sen. Majority Leader in decades . Whereas Feingold has been an effective Senator and has never looked or acted like an idiot ( unlike < PROPMALE > ) . The world has a sense of humor . 
Note I've changed my profile picture ; just reminding folks that at least some Dems have ethics -- and completely understand what happened last evening , why it happened , and that it's time for Obama to understand the people were here before he became POTUS -- and will be here after he's gone home to Chicago . 
Brewers hired < PROPMALE > Roenicke as manager ; he seems OK from hearing his first press conference , but I'd never heard of him before this ( he was the Angels bench coach for five years ) . Let's hope he's a lot better \fit\ " than < PROPMALE > Macha . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Czisny wins Skate Canada ; way to go , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Put \Sounds of Nightfall\ " into Universe Slush ; it's the only way to try for publication with Universe Annex . Please wish me luck . " 
Good news : Realms of Fantasy bought . Bad news : they were bought by Damnation Books LLC , who is _not_ a recommended market ( see Preditors and Editors for details , or my blog ): \ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/realms-of-fantasy-bought-updated/ 
Hands continue to be bad -- muscle relaxants help enough to drive and type a little , but not much more than that . I have to hope tomorrow is better ; this interferes greatly with my writing and editing . 
Happy Veterans Day ! Thanks to all who've served , including my late husband , my father , my uncles , my cousins , and many of my friends . 
Uncle < PROPMALE > had two setbacks this week ; the ventilator is back in , and it's unclear whether his mentation is improving or not . He's now spent two full months in the hospital after cardiac surgery ; my Aunt has been there with him the whole , entire time . Please say prayers for < PROPMALE > , and for Aunt < PROPFIRST > , if you would . 
Wrote 3600 words into a new Elfyverse story -- very pleased with my progress , as I woke up with one line in my head and had to get it down immediately . ;) 
My poem , \No Rest 
Bristol stays over < PROPFEMALE > on DWTS ; other finalists are < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . While life as we know it won't end with Bristol P . in the finals , she does NOT deserve to be there and is a horrible dancer . 
OK -- new blog post . I've been sick for two days , and have had two thoughts on my mind -- War Poetry ( at WinningWriters.com ) and the whole \Bristol Palin Scandal\ " on DWTS . So here goes . . . something ? \ 
Under the weather , but up and doing laundry . Saturday was a total wipe-out . Wasn't online _at all_ . Slept , slept , and slept some more . Still feel bad , but better than yesterday . 
Tornado Warning . 
All clear sounded twenty minutes ago . Or maybe it was twenty years . 
Happy Thanksgiving , folks . 
We got very bad news from my Aunt < PROPFIRST > today ; Uncle < PROPMALE > is having massive trouble breathing even with the respirator . Please say prayers that somehow my Aunt will be OK . . . I don't know what else to ask for . \ 
My Mom is devastated , and I feel bad , too . For such a brilliant man to endure ten weeks in the hospital after an extensive cardiac operation , never to get out . . . not the ending we all wanted . 
Uncle < PROPMALE > passed away today at noon . Memorial is planned on December 11th . All honor to his memory , and to my Aunt < PROPFIRST > .

< PROPFEMALE > Edwards dies at 61 . Please see my blog post for my brief , yet heartfelt , thoughts about Mrs. Edwards . \ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/elizabeth-edwards-dies-at-61/ 
My cousins , Mom and sister are all paying respects to my uncle in another state this weekend . I hope my Aunt < PROPFIRST > will be comforted by all those who have traveled to be with her and remember Uncle < PROPMALE > -- but I also hope she'll know many of us couldn't get there but are there in spirit . 
I definitely am not a fan of the \new\ " profile and will not upgrade to it unless forced . " 
Weather alert : heavy winds gusting to 50 mph and snow . . . my sister and Mom are traveling back to WI today and will run into this mess at some point . It's not expected to be gone until 6 PM CST . . . it hit around 4:30 a.m. 
Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > Czisny , winner of the Grand Prix Ladies Figure Skating event held this week in Beijing . . . it aired earlier today , I just watched it , and she was outstanding and deserved her win . 
< PROPFIRST > Favre did not play this evening , snapping his regular-season consecutive games streak at 297 . He has at least three admitted-injuries -- a broken foot , a bad shoulder , and pain in his right hand ( it's swollen and blue-tinted ) -- he's an incredibly tough guy , so his arm injury must be extensive . I wish him the best . 
Now that I've had my fun for the evening , I need to start thinking about writing . I hope to write a blog about Favre's streak coming to an end ( a magnificent achievement , comparable to Cal Ripken's in baseball ( 2632 games straight , comprising 16 seasons of play ) -- 20 years of brilliant play . ( I also have to try , again , to fix five very stubborn chapters of WIP . ) 
Still thinking about my new blog . So much has been written about Favre -- maybe I should just write about what his streak has meant to me as a Packers fan/football fan . \ 
As for writing -- man . Some nights are tougher than others . Maybe I should work on something else and go back to what's stalled in a day or two when my mind's fresher . 
New blog post up about Favre's streak ending :\ 
http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/brett-favres-consecutive-games-streak-ends/ 
Brewers get Greinke , Betancourt , sending Escobar , Cain , Jeffress and Odirizzi to the Royals in exchange . Mostly I see this as a good trade , though I hate to see < PROPMALE > Cain go . 
My holiday prayer : I hope those who need cures will get them , for those children awaiting adoption to be adopted , then loved deeply , and for everyone else to never have to worry about food , shelter or heat . Amen . 
My new blog post is not for the faint of heart , though my Widownet friends should enjoy it . . . . \

Winter Xmas storm tallies -- < PROPFEMALE > 1 , curb 0 . ;) 
Looks like the Packers will win a very sloppy , interception-filled game at home to gain the playoffs . Color me unimpressed . 
Please join me in mourning the passing of < PROPFIRST > Carlson , a very kind and gracious woman who has left this life due to cancer . I knew her slightly due to helping the HRC campaign ( and staying allied with HRC Dems ever since ) . . . she will be greatly missed . 
I wonder where my other status update went from earlier today about poor < PROPFEMALE > Giffords ; wrote a quick blog , which is available at my elfyverse.wordpress.com site , about what was known as of 4 PM EST . Haven't been back long enough to hear an update ; how is she doing ? Does anyone know ? 
I see FB changed my profile . I hope they got some enjoyment out of it . I surely didn't . 
Mom left something behind at the grocery store today and thought it was gone forever . It wasn't; I called , and sure enough , it was there -- I went and got it for her . There are still good people on this Earth and today it was proven to us , once again . 
For my N/R and Haven friends . . . I'm being affected by the FB issue , thus am having trouble getting and sending gifts and even playing the games . Sometimes I can play , sometimes I can't , but no matter what I do I can't send gifts . Hope N/R and Haven fixes whatever they need _soon_ . 
Has anyone but me noticed that on these awards shows , no one ever thanks their bratty children ? Or their ugly children ? \ 
Nope , all these award nominees have are \beautiful children . \ " Hmmm . " 
Blizzard conditions . Possible phone problems . May be offline more than online for the next day or two . 
Some days are better than others , some . . . not . Today I'm meditating on the St. < PROPFIRST > of Assisi quote that goes something to the effect that \Not all the darkness in the world can extinguish the light from a single candle . \"" 
Flu-ish , achy , and miserable . Online ' cause \women should not sleep all day and expect to be interesting . \ " ;) " 
Got over to Mom's . She says I look awful and if I'm no better tomorrow I'd best go to the ER . 
Still more sick than well . Stayed in today and slept . I hope to be able to get out tomorrow and do _something_ . 
Still way under the weather . I can do about three things per day -- minor things -- then I'm done . Tomorrow I will have to drag myself into the doctor and hope they'll see me despite my lack of money and insurance . 
Went to doctor ; verdict -- sinus infection plus bronchitis . Antibiotics given ; I've just started ' em . Have to take Mucinex plus Sudafed , use more saline nasal sprays ( I've been using ' em , but I guess more ? ) , and I have a cough syrup for nigh t-t ime use . 
The antibiotics hit me really hard . I'm up now , but was asleep just about all of Saturday . I hope today won't be another washout ; I'm tired of being ill . 
Feeling much better today . Wrote a very short story this morning . . . glad my creativity has returned . 
Bad winter snowstorm here ; nearly impassable roads , snow blowing sideways , few trucks out . If you live in SE Wisconsin or Northern IL , STAY HOME . ( I wrote a blog saying the same thing , FWIW . ) 
Weather continues at white-out or near white-out conditions . Car is in driveway and drift is up to the engine , at least . . . bad wind gusts continue . Dogs can't go out in this . Really don't like this weather at all . 
Mom and I managed to clear the furnace vent by throwing hot water at the snowdrift until we could see it , then using the broom to clear the snow . It took almost two hours . ( Back stoop is fairly clear but that's all ; used the hot water method to clear it so we could get at the vent . ) 
Dad was approached by two con artists claiming to be from the Water Dept . They cased the joint while he was downstairs running the water ( they said a sewer main was broken ) . Dad is not hurt . Apparently nothing was taken ; my things ( including instruments ) are still there , and my computer is still there also . Police have already taken a report . 
Still blocked in with the huge drifts . We won't know whether or not my Mom's male friend can get here for hours yet -- there isn't much Mom or I can do to affect the situation . ( But at least we got the furnace vent unblocked . That's something . ) 
Mom's friend came , got a pathway for the dogs in the back , and a path through the front walk . Still can't get out . We're trying to get additional help ; he'll come back tomorrow if we can't find anyone . 
We're dug out ; streets are mostly barely passable . Got to Dad's . Three pieces of jewelry , one costume , was taken from my room . Police report has been filed . The robbers even looked through < PROPFIRST>'s ashes , trying to find something of value . I feel soiled . 
Temp is back up over 100 F . Antibiotics are working but the stress of the past few days has taken its toll . Those of you who've commented about the recent crises , thank you . Those of you who cared but did not comment -- thank you , also . 
Various folks have been posting and reposting about the need for health care in the USA . I agree with them , but would rather write my own posts about the subject . We're in a crisis due to the lack of affordable health care and anyone who doesn't see that is a fool . 
Super Bowl is a big mess . Fans turned away ' cause seats are unsafe . Half-time show mix is bad , which didn't help the singers . . . so far the Packers appear to be the far better team , but the second half awaits . I think the Packers have the edge , but I am actually rooting more for those poor fans who ended up with no seats . 
Doctor said three things : 1 ) I have a sinus infection ( he thinks the bronchitis is gone ) , 2 ) he's moving out of the area , and 3 ) I lost six more pounds . ( One pound per month , but at least I'm not gaining . ) 
Rihanna's dress at the Grammy's -- awful . Yes , it fits her . Yes , it's see-through . Yes , it's tacky . She can sing , but she can't dress . 
My father should be very happy with this -- < PROPFIRST > Weeks signed to a 4-year contract extension . ( He's been upset with the slow progress of the Weeks/Brewers talks all winter . ) 
MoveOn.org stands with the protestors in Wisconsin who are fighting for their rights to collectively bargain ; even though I broke with MoveOn.org years ago over other issues , I stand with them in this . What Gov . < PROPMALE > is trying to do is plain , flat wrong . 
I'm declaring Saturday , February 19 , 2011 , a stress-free zone . 
Broke big block , writing-wise , last evening after some good advice from a friend received . . . came out compressed , so the 4K I wrote probably will end up being 9 or 10K once I figure out what else needs to be there . ( But I wrote _action scenes_ , * not * setup as I had been doing . Yay ! ) 
Hoping for the best w/r/t Japanese earthquake/tsunami . . . many , many dead and worst of all , they can't get to some of the more rural areas due to damage to roads , bridges , etc ., so there's undoubtedly more injured people who haven't been taken to hospitals yet . Keeping my fingers crossed . 
Lots and lots of writing tonight . . . six reviews ( two for Shiny Book Review , four for Amazon.com ) and 2200 words of fiction later , I am tired yet exhilirated . ;-) 
Car overheats ; back in shop . Car is 14 years old and it's probably something to do with the radiator . Let's hope it's a cheap repair because that's all I can afford . 
No word on car . Garage had no time for it , or me , today . We'll see tomorrow . 
Car is fixed and I can pick it up tomorrow ( they fixed it about two minutes before close of business ) . It needed a radiator hose that's just underneath the main radiator apparatus ; the reason my car overheated is because there was _zero_ coolant in the car . 
Car is fixed . Seems to be OK now . Broke until next week , but at least I have my car . :-) 
< PROPMALE > Schultz just reported at MSNBC that there now has been * some * looting in Japan . I wrote 150 words at my blog about it . . . no video yet has been posted online , or if there has been , I'm too ignorant to find it . If * you * find it , please let * me * know and I'll add it to my blog . 
Diet Mountain Dew flavors . . . interesting . Good caffeine source , too . 
Oh , and I forgot to add in something about < PROPFEMALE > Ferraro in my blog . Very inspirational woman . Strong , capable and confident , she would've made an exceptional Vice President and an even better President had she ever had the opportunity . 
I am ill . This is not much of a surprise . . . but the doctor said I have a sinus infection ( upper sinuses only , but bad enough ) and an upper respiratory infection . I have an antibiotic and get to take all sorts of OTC meds , plus another nasal spray . Doctor said I should rest and continue to take the meds I have been taking along with these new ones . ( Maybe I should open a pharmacy ? ) 
Fell , and fell hard , outside a Speedway in Milwaukee ( was doing an errand for Mom ) . Hit my left knee , then my right cheekbone -- I look awful but broke nothing . Everything hurts . Now have a Rx for Percoset to add to my collection . 
Despite the injury , got a story off to WotF , one they've never seen before . ;-) We'll see if they like it better . Further deponent sayeth not . 
Voted . 
Today's referendums on < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > -- Milwaukee County Exec race goes to < PROPFIRST > Abele , D ( this was < PROPMALE>'s job before he became Gov ) . . . the Kloppenburg/Prosser state Supreme Court race is 50/50 with 51% of the vote in , too close to call . Prosser is the Incumbent , is a conservative Republican , and said he'd be an advocate for < PROPMALE > . ( Hint : he should've won easily , if not for that . ) 
Breaking news -- < PROPFEMALE > Kloppenburg has filed for the recount . This is the only way to make sure how many votes are out there as optical scanners and voting machines can be manipulated . This is a < PROPMALE > , by-hand recount . Good for her ! 
Some days , I just wish the anvil would fall and be done with it already . 
< PROPFIRST > Lohan sentenced to jail on Good Friday . . . probation violation due to shoplifting . You'd think Lohan would've realized after the first stint in jail she didn't want to be there . . . don't understand her . ( Good for the judge . ) 
Brewers playing < PROPMALE > Astros -- current score , < PROPMALE > 9 , Brewers 6 , Top 10th ( former Brewers playing for Astros -- < PROPMALE > Hall at 2B , < PROPFIRST > Bourgeois in the OF , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > in the OF ( out of game ) , < PROPFIRST > Inglett pinch hit -- have all played/contributed in this game ) 
Happy Easter , everyone ! Here's a new blog post , not-so-coincidentally called Meditations on Easter . http://elfyverse.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/meditations-on-easter/ 
Tired -- observed judicial recount in Racine County for a few hours today . This is gonna take a while . 
Just observed Speaker of the House < PROPFIRST > Boehner ( R-OH ) on TV -- he's giving < PROPFEMALE > Pelosi a run for her money with regards to what sure looks like Botox injections . ( Note to men : stay away from the Botox . ) 
< PROPFIRST > Trump -- the perils of way too much self-promotion . ( Just sayin ' . ) 
I am going to write this evening , somehow .
