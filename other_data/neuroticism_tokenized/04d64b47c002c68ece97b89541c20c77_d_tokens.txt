< PROPFIRST>'s coming home for a four day weekend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've got to figure out what I'm going to make for dinner ... maybe orange glazed chicken , broccoli , steamed rice and a spinach salad ??? 

Can't sleep ... maybe I'll take a bubble bath to help relax . I may even get crazy and pour myself a glass of wine . 
I'm excited to see my friend < PROPFEMALE > ! She's finally back from her England trip . :o ) 
I miss my hubby !!!!! Thankfully , he has a four day weekend next week ! 
Sleep is yet an elusive dream . Oh how I long for eight blessed hours of uninterrupted slumber ! I think tonight I shall take a sleeping pill . ( Okay , maybe that’s a little melodramatic but after two nights of very little sleep dear god I’m tired ! ) 
Okay , I’m starting to think there’s a big conspiracy in my house to try to keep me awake . I just tried to lay down for a nap and was abruptly woken up by Mr. Snugglesworth ( my cat ) head butting one of my kidneys ! 
I only have one of Haide’s paws left to cut the nails on and then grind them smooth ! After that , it brush and bath time for all my furry babies . If I still have energy after that I’m steam cleaning the carpet . Wish me luck . 
My OBGYN was telling me about the HCG diet . He said it will help with fertility . Plus , I’ll lose all the weight I’ve put on from my hypothyroidism . So , I’ve looked it up on the internet and it looks a little to good to be true . Does anyone know anyt 
I’m currently reading Dracula by Bram Stoker and finding it a painstakingly slow read . Don’t get me wrong , it’s a very interesting and provocative read , but it’s not exactly what I expected . Have any of you read it ? If so , what did you think ? ( Ple 
After three hundred painstakingly long pages the characters have finally decided to seek out and kill Dracula ! Thank God !!! Only two hundred pages to go . ( Normally I can read a book of this size in one or two days . This one has taken me two weeks just to 
I finally finished reading Dracula !!! Sorry Bram Stoker , I loved your idea but I’m NOT going to recommend your long , slow , and , sometimes very boring novel to anyone . I feel like I’ve defeated my arch nemesis ! 
Haide , my sweet lovable Mastiff , has arthritis in both her back hip joints . The poor dear has been limping around all day . I hope her medicine kicks in soon ... 
Haide is spending the night at the Animal Emergency Center in < PROPFIRST > . Around 8pm she started having problems breathing , her stomach looked like she was doing crunches , she was lethargic , and her eyes weren't focusing . So far all we know is that its not bl 
Haide is home ! She's back in for a check up next week . We still don't know what's going on with her . We are waiting for lab results . Her red cell count was low and her white cell count was high so there is some sort of infection going on . She's waggi 
We have a diagnosis for Haide . She has immune mediated hemolytic anemia ( IMHA ) . Basically , her immune system is attacking and killing her red blood cells . Yes it can be fatal , but it’s also treatable and we’re NOT going to let this condition have her ! 
I wish I could get Haide to eat . She even turned her nose up at chicken ! She's only eaten 9oz . of prescription wet food today , and that's just because I added to her water . Thank God , the vet also gave us a high calorie dietary supplement . 
I hate seeing Haide in so much pain . 
Haide seems to be doing a little better . Tomorrow morning I’m taking her in for another round of blood tests . Once we get those results back we’ll know if she’ll need a blood transfusion or not . Please keep my furry baby in your prayers ! 
Haide’s results from today’s CBC were promising ! Her red blood cell count and her platelet count were both a little higher ! So the Prednisone is working ! Her white blood cells have increased too , so the vet put her on an additional antibiotic to help 
It just NOT a good time to be a pet in the Fitzgerald family . Smudge , my in-laws Maine Coon cat , had to stay the night at their vet on an IV . He has some sort of infection , his stomach is bloated , and he may have a blockage in his intestines . Poor furry b 
Friends and Family -- Please read the note titled \Haide Girl \"" 
I’ve decided I must be a very passionate person . I love those close to my heart with a fierceness and when they’re gone I morn with a almost debilitating sorrow . 
My fat cat is a little less fat ! < PROPFEMALE > has lost a pound and a half ! I guess her Rx food really is working ... :o ) 
Today has been rough . I miss my Haide girl so much ! 
My husband just called me a racist because I prefer English Mastiffs to Bullmastiffs . Then he said that I’m also a sexist because I’d prefer to get a girl dog ! LMAO !!! He just cracks me up ! :o ) 
I'm about to take a hot bubble bath . Then crawl in bed with a book . I know that's not very exciting , but it sounds amazing to me ! Night , night everyone ! 
I just stepped on a BIG fat spider and hundreds of < PROPFEMALE > baby spiders appeared after it was dead ! How freaking crazy is that !!!! Now , I have the worst creepy crawly feeling . I hope I don’t have nightmares tonight ... 
Did you know that the tap water in < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > has to much calcium in it and commonly causes bladder problems in dogs , cats & humans ??? Poor < PROPFEMALE > girl has crystals in her bladder and she & Mr. Snugglesworth both have bladder infections ! My poor babies ! I feel bad for them ! Hopefully , their antibiotic will make them feel better soon . 
My mother-in-law bought a 8wk old , female , solid black Yorkie-poo today and she’s having trouble coming up with a name for her . Do any of you have suggestions ??? 
I need to clean my bathroom . Maybe I'll do that tomorrow ... 
I miss my Haide ! She used to come lay her big heavy head on my mouse hand , wag her tail , and look up at me with her big beautiful brown eyes when she thought I had sent to much time on the computer . 
Does any one know where I can find Tru Blood the drink ? It's a blood orange soda from the HBO show True Blood . It was suppose to hit stores today . I want to get some for the shows finally on Sunday . 
Night , night everyone ! I'm going to try to go to bed early tonight . Hopefully I'll be able to sleep a solid 8 hrs . Wish me luck ! 
I'm excited about adopting a Mastiff !!!!!!! Our home interveiw will be later this week . Then after we're approved we get to met the dogs ! :o ) 
Tonight I get to spend some quality time with my hubby , then tomorrow we have UFC tickets !!! < PROPFIRST>'s very excited about that second part . :o ) 
Just got back from 5 hrs . of UFC ( somewhat bloody ) entertainment and lots of macho crud humor . And yes I loved every minute of it ! What a fun night !!! :o ) 
Waiting for dinner to cook . Teriyaki chicken , twice baked potatoes , and steamed broccoli . Plus , I have a beef roast , potatoes , & carrots in the crock pot cooking for tomorrow . It's starting to smell very yummy at my house ! :o ) 
I'm tired of not feeling good ! This is my favorite time of year and I want to be able to enjoy it !!! 
I just found some pictures of Haide on our camera that I had forgotten about ... I miss her sooooooooooo much ! 
< PROPFEMALE > from the Mastiff rescue is coming to do our home visit and interview on Sunday ! And she's going to bring < PROPFEMALE > with her !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm SO excited to met her ! :o ) Hopefully , < PROPFIRST > will be able to come home for this big event . 
My in-laws , husband ( for those that don't know < PROPFIRST>'s stationed at Ft . Sill in Lawton ) , and mom are all coming over tonight ! I've got a lot of cleaning to do ... 
We adopted < PROPFEMALE > ( a mastiff ) today !!!! She's a very sweet but shy girl . I'll post some picz of her sometime soon . :o ) 
I am LOVING my new little mastiff girl ! She's amazing ! Very shy , but she's slowly starting to warm warm up . I got lots of doggy kisses today !!! :o ) 
Ok , so if Haide was a \tea cup\ " Mastiff then I think < PROPFEMALE > is a \ " shot glass\ " Mastiff ! :o ) She's such a little girl ! Only 93 pounds ! " 
Night , night everyone ! I'm going to curl up with my puppy and go to sleep . 
I LOVE having a Mastiff door greeter again ! There’s nothing like opening the door to a big sweet goofy dog grin ! 
I just witnessed one of the grosses sights in my life ! It dealt with < PROPFEMALE > poop and dog throw up . I’ll just leave the details to your imaginations . My stomach is still churning from cleaning up that lovely mess . :o ( 
I love dogs , but I am not a fan of small yippy ankle bitters . Tonight just helped reinforce my dislike . A crazed Pomeranian/Chihuahua mix bit me ! The evil little shit bit my hand while I was trying to pick up his leash . I’m okay . He broke the skin in a couple of places , it’s a little sore , and I’m pretty sure it will be bruised tomorrow . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I just got back from her first Pet Smart trip . She did so good !!!! :o ) 
Loud snoring , loud sighing , loud barking , loud belching . I had really missed the unique sounds of a mastiff . < PROPFEMALE > has made our house feel ( and sound ) like home again . :o ) 
< PROPFEMALE > helped me pull out all my Halloween decorations this weekend . It’s crazy just how much Halloween stuff I’ve accumulated through the years . I'm starting to get excited about the party !!! It’s only 17 days away ! :o ) 
What are you going to be for Halloween ??????????????????? 
I HATE ear infections ! Thank God for ear numbing drops ! 
I'm soooooooo tired of being sick ! 
I love the way < PROPFEMALE > greets me at the door with lots of excited , sloppy kisses and tail waging ! It makes me feel so loved !!! :o ) 
I'm puppy sitting Ally tonight ! :o ) 
My \lap mastiff\ " keeps trying to crawl onto my computer chair with me ! LOL !!! I guess she wants to play on the internet too ! :o ) " 
The living room ceiling is leaking ! And < PROPFIRST > found water in the floor vents ! So , I’ve just spent the last 4 hrs . looking for houses on the internet . I HATE the process of moving , but we’ve got to get out of this house before I lose my mind . Right now I’m just looking at rentals because we don’t know where < PROPFIRST > is going to be after February . You gotta love the Army . ~ Sorry , I needed to rant a little . 
< PROPFEMALE > is amazing ! I had put something on the stove and had forgotten about it . She came in the back room to the computer and wouldn’t leave me alone . She was head butting me and acting very strange . Finally , I got up and followed her to the front of the house where I saw ( and smelled ) the food burning . Soon after I took care of the burnt food she got a big treat and lots of lovins ! Love this dog ! 
6 days until Halloween !!! I've gotta get busy on the house . :o ) 
Low Point of my Day : Accidently slicing through a vein in my finger at work and going to the ER . High Point of my Day : Lortab and pizza 
5 days until Halloween !!! 
4 days until Halloween !!! Do you have your costume yet ? 
3 days until Halloween !!!!!!!! 
Happy Halloween everyone !!!!!!! 
It's party time !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I'm STILL taking down Halloween decorations . This is my least favorite part of any holiday ! Anyone want to help ... 
Tomorrow is < PROPFIRST>'s 33rd birthday ! Wow , we're getting old !!! :o ) 
I'm thinking about going to the 50 cent movies tomorrow to see < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half Blood < PROPMALE > . Does anyone want to join me ? It's showing at 4:30 pm and 9:15 pm . 
Good thing : Wal-Mart just put their Halloween decorations on sale for 75% off , so I stocked up ! Bad thing : Now I've got to go back and buy another plastic container to put all my new stuff in . 
Hate is a strong word and I think it gets used to much , but I HATE this rental house and my landlord ! I’m so tried of this drama . I hope and pray I can find a new place soon . 
I feel very blah today . 
Ms. < PROPFEMALE > had a rough time last night . First she had a bad case of hiccups . After a few dog treats and some ice cubes they finally went away . Then about five minutes after we got in bed I felt her roll over , then heard a loud thump . She fell out of bed ! She was okay , a bit shaken , but okay . My poor sweet clumsy girl ! 
I just bought our New < PROPFEMALE > tickets for Next Saturday !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I get to see my husband tonight !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I just watched Monday’s episode of The Big Bang Theory and at one point I laughed so hard I actually had to use my inhaler . I love that crazy show ! 
I should be cooking or cleaning , but I have a killer headache so I think it's nap time . 
Hello my name is < PROPFEMALE > and I’m addicted to books !!! 
Yay !!!!! < PROPFEMALE > just sat for me for the first time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I think getting sick and throwing up at work has got to be one of the worst feelings ever ! I don't want whatever this is ! I hope and pray I feel better tomorrow ... 
< PROPFEMALE > and I are going to try this whole sleep thing again . Wish us luck ! 
Bah Humbug !!!!!!!!!!! 
I’ve been sick ALL week with the flu and a sinus infection . My doctor put me on Tamiflu and the Z pack and I STILL feel like crap ! I’m a lot better than I was but I’m still running a fever , coughing , my nose is raw from all the tissues I’m having to use , and I still have a killer headache . The worst part is I’m going to miss out on most of my favorite things about December . Bah Humbug ! 
My sweet < PROPFEMALE > has an ear infection . :o ( Thanks again < PROPFIRST > for taking her to the vet for me ! < PROPFIRST > & I truly do have the best friends ever !!! 
Thanks for all my sweet & loving birthday messages !!! I really have been blessed with wonderful friends & family ! Unfortunately , I’m still sick and even had to go to the ER this morning . Not only do I still have the flu and a sinus infection , but now I have the added fun of bronchitis . :o ( Happy birthday to me !!! 
I miss < PROPFIRST > . Can't wait until this current Lawton deployment is over ! 
I’m excited about seeing Avatar in 3D and setting in the < PROPMALE > balcony ! I’ve never gotten balcony seats before . :o ) 
< PROPFEMALE > just came back into the house wearing a drool sickle ! Yucky !!!! 
I’ve just spend most of my evening on the computer looking for a rental house in the Norman/Noble/Moore area and haven’t had much luck . Tomorrow , I think I’m going to go old school and drive around looking for rental signs . Do any of you know of a nice ( 3 bed , 2 bath , with a fenced in yard ) rental house in that area that would allow a Mastiff and two < PROPFEMALE > cats ??? 
I’m back from the frozen tundra known as Minnesota ! I had fun , but it’s good to be home !!! 
< PROPFIRST > sent me roses ! I love my man !!! :o )

Is it just me or is FB running VERY SLOW today ??? 
I'm sick ... again , or maybe I should say still . I'm not sure I ever fully recovered from all the loveliness I had back in December . :o ( Yesterday , I went and had a CT done of my sinuses . Hopefully that will help my doctor figure out how to get me well . I don’t want to have another sinus surgery , but at this point I’d do about anything to feel better . Do you know any magic fairies ? :o ) 
Procrastinate now . Don’t wait ! :o ) ~ Ellen DeGeneres

After being deployed for 3years , 5months , and 21days < PROPFIRST > is finally coming home for good ... ( well he’ll be home until the next deployment anyway . ) It’s going to be strange living with him again after so long . I’m a little nervous , but very excited ! I have butterflies in my stomach ! :o ) 
\Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living . \ " ~ Mother < PROPFIRST > Jones " 
< PROPFEMALE > just told me that my allotted computer time is up and I need to go give her a good tummy rub ASAP ! LOL ! :o ) 
My chest feels so tight it’s hard to get a full breath . :o ( Wish I felt better . 
Tightness in my chest + 102.8 fever + shortness of breath + BP of 140/98 + heart rate of 100 + tasting blood every time I coughed = 6am trip to the < PROPFIRST > ER & a diagnosis of bronchitis 
The narcotic cough suppressant that the ER doctor prescribed for me has the following warning on it : “Do not use this product to make a child sleepy . ” How crazy sad is that ?!?! LMAO !!! 
I’m SO tired of being sick ! My PCP is sending me to an ENT/surgeon on the 16th . Hopefully , he’ll help make me well again . 
\There is no charge for awesomeness ... or attractiveness . \ " ~ Po played by < PROPFIRST > Black in the 2008 animated movie Kung Fu Panda " 
If I’m not well soon I’m afraid my head might actually explode from pure frustration . :o ( 
I get to go to the Otolaryngologist ( ENT ) today !!! And get a < PROPFEMALE > camera shoved up my nose !!! I know you’re all so very very jealous , right ???? 
Well my doctor’s appt . went good today . He said that my sinuses still look good structurally from my 2004 surgery , so for now he changed a few of my medicines ( hoping that will help ) and wants to see me back in two weeks . 
I was just abruptly woken up by < PROPFEMALE > choking on a piece of paper ! Thank God I had read about how to do the doggy Heimlich maneuver ! Plus , I had seen it on the Dr. Oz Show . And thank God I heard her ! She was in the hall and I was asleep with both the bedroom doors closed . I guess my “pet parent spidey sense” must have kicked in !!! Now , I just have to figure out how in the world she got that paper .

Trying to convince < PROPFIRST > to watch New < PROPFEMALE > with me . So far I’m not having much luck . :o ( 
< PROPFIRST>'s reading the Twilight saga !!! Love my husband !!! 
It’s finally time to lay down , relax , and read a little of the newest < PROPMALE > Dresden book ! 
< PROPFIRST > and I are starting P90X . We weighed our selves , measured our body fat , wrote down all our measurements , took our before pictures , and took the fitness test . Tomorrow will be our official day 1 and I’m excited ! Wish us luck ! 
Wow , P90X is kicking my booty ! Muscles I didn’t even know I had are sore ! 
I miss my sweet little Haide girl . She seems to be haunting most my thoughts today . Anytime I close my eyes I see her goofy doggie smile . 
Thank God for Benadryl ! My poor < PROPFEMALE > is broke out in hives again on her tummy and muzzle . I’m starting to think she may be allergic to grass . This only seems to happen after she has rolled around outside , but I hate to tell her that she can’t play in the grass . I mean , isn’t that a big part of the whole being a dog thing ?!?! 
I got so many things that I need to do , but all I want to do is set down a read my book ! 
I just unclogged the bathtub , cleaned the toilets , and started laundry . Now I’m trying to decided if I should go make a hot breakfast for my husband or go read my book ... 
I learned two valuable kitchen lessons today . 1 flour can be freezer burned . 2 wheat flour makes nasty gravy . 
I’m a little bummed that our Oklahoma cowboys/bothers team didn’t win the million on The Amazing Race . Hopefully , the kid from Oklahoma will win The Biggest Loser ! Yes , I’ve been watching entirely to much T.V. lately .

I sometimes talk in my sleep and last night I woke myself up twice from talking ! How insane is that ?!?! LOL !!! Plus , I had several crazy and bad dreams that kept waking me up . I hope my sleep tonight is more restful . 
Today would have been Haide girl's fifth birthday . I really do miss that sweet lovable dog !

There should be a new law that bans cell phone usage while a person is checking out at a store . It’s just plain rude to everyone around them . Especially , when they ask the cashier to “hold on” or “what , can you repeat that” or they have to keep resliding their credit card because they can’t take one minute to actually read the machine . 
\When you can see your unborn children\ 
So my air conditioner is out and I can’t get anyone out to fix it until the morning . In this instance most normal people would open all their windows and pray for a good breeze . Unfortunately , I can’t do this because of my allergies . Lucky me ! I get to try to sleep in a sauna tonight !!! I know you’re all so very jealous , right ?!?! 
\I try to be the person my dog thinks I am . \ " ~ unknown " 
\There is a saying : yesterday is\ 
I think I’m fighting getting sick . :o ( I’m trying my hardest to stay well with lots of rest , healthy foods , lots of fluids , using my netti pot ( sinus wash thing ) and taking my vitamins . I hope it will be enough . 
I found out Athena’s deep dark secret and what I believe is the source of her dragon breath . When I let her out to go potty at night she eats those big nasty June bugs ! I caught her in the act ! She was acting like they were this wonderful delicacy . She reminds me of Timon off of The Lion < PROPMALE > . “Ooh , the little cream-filled kind ! ” “Slimy yet satisfying . ” 
We're going to go look at another house tonight ! I'm very excited and hopeful !!! 
Okay , I like the house we saw today a lot better than the last one we looked at . It had several “WOW” factors for us ! But , I HATE the ugly green carpet that’s throughout most of the house and the ugly laminate flooring that’s in the kitchen and dinning room !!! That would HAVE to go ! 
I just feel ... off today . 
Stupid people make my head hurt . 
I wish my real bank account looked more like my Mafia Wars bank account . 
I’m ready for some big changes . Bring it on world !!! 
An elderly couple was attending church , about halfway through she leans over and says , “I just had some silent gas . What do you think I should do ? ” He replies “Put a new battery in your hearing aid . ” ~ * ~ I laughed so hard that I cried the first time I heard this joke . Enjoy !!! ~ * ~ 
It’s finally time to go immerse myself in the fictional world of < PROPFIRST > Westerfeld’s “uglies” and “pretties . ” Thanks again < PROPFEMALE > for letting me borrow these books ! You’re amazing !!! 
I've just spent the last several hours trying to sleep , but not having any luck . :o ( Hopefully , I can at least get a couple of hours before I have to go to work at noon . Thanks God I didn't have to come in early today ! 
Coke Cola is an amazing product . You can use it to eat battery acid off a car battery . It will make an old tarnished < PROPFEMALE > shine like new again . You can even use it to get motor oil and grease out of clothes . I’m just not sure we should be drinking it ... 
Before you take your dogs out in this heat please think of their poor little paws . Would you want to put your bare feet on the HOT concrete or asphalt ?!?! 
I feel sick to my stomach . Wondering if I ate something bad ... 
My throat is a little sore and I think I have a sinus headache forming . :o ( I don’t want to get sick !!! Hopefully the neti pot , vitamin C , and a full nights sleep will be all the medicine I’ll need . 
It’s done ! It only took three days , my husbands help , and lots of dog treats , but we finally cut and grinded down all of Athena’s nails !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Collins ' Mockingjay came out today ! But I ordered mine online to save same $ which means I still won't get it for a couple of days . :o (

Please pray for my cousin < PROPFEMALE > and her baby girl < PROPFEMALE > . 
Why can't I sleep ?!?!?!?!?! Tomorrow is going to be a very long day . 
I’m plotting ... That’s right , be afraid , be very afraid . Mwahahaha !!! :o ) 
My car has an appt . at the car doctor at 8 in the morning . I hope and pray that they’re able to diagnose the problem and fix it at a reasonable price and in a timely fashion .

I’m not feeling the best ... my tummy hurts . :o ( I better NOT be getting sick again ! 
It's time to feed my tummy ! 
I'm about to go snuggle up on the couch with < PROPFEMALE > and watch a couple of episodes of Bones . 
I just realized just how much training < PROPFIRST > is going to be doing before his upcoming Afghanistan deployment and I’m not very happy about it . Don’t get me wrong , I want him to be well prepared . But I also want to spend time with him before he’s gone for another year . It feels like I just got him back from the last deployment . 
I’m seriously thinking about taking my in-laws up on their very kind offer and moving to Texas while < PROPFIRST > is deployed . I’ve still got a lot to think about ... 
So , I think < PROPFEMALE > thinks I’m her own personal napkin . Doggie drool mixed with pureed Bil-Jac , great ! Thankfully , I don’t have a weak stomach . LOL ! :o ) 
If you run out in traffic at night wearing only black you’re just asking to be taken out of the < PROPFIRST > pool . Survival of the fittest baby ! 
I thoroughly enjoyed my day . I got to see lots of really cute dogs in very creative & fun costumes . One English Mastiff , < PROPFEMALE > , was dress in reggae style like < PROPMALE > Marley . She had dreadlocks and everything . LOL ! I wish I had pictures ... 
< PROPFIRST > and I are going to have a scarey movie marathon in honor of Halloween !!! 
I'm excited ! Tonight is < PROPFEMALE > Stallman’s Bachelorette Party !!!! 
We're back home from Eureka Springs , Arkansas where our good friends , < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > , got married . We had a blast , but boy I'm I tried now . 
Last night < PROPFIRST > & I watched The Box . It was awful ! Definitely , one of the worst movies I’ve even seen . 
Best quote of the day- “Don’t let your meness get lager than your weness . ” 
This will be my last weekend at Pet Smart . I'm both happy & a lil sad ...
