Put this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort . As everyone knows , being killed by Avada Kedavra , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone , muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't copy and ... paste this . Will you make this your status to spread awareness of this growing threat ?
