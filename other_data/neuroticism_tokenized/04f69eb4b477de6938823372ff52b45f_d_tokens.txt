Totally fired up again at the state of the American education system . < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > had to listen to my tirade for the past half and hour about how proficiency tests don't actually assess whether or not students are meeting standards and how between the 4th grade and high school our students start in the top 25% of industrialized nations , but fall into the bottom 25% during those years . Our students deserve better ! Maybe I'll be like Dr. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and start my own school . Who's with me ?
