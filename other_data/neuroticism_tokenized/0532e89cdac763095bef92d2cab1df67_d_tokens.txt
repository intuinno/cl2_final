Those brown eyed boys will be the death of me ... ~ < PROPFIRST > Borden 
going to the movies to see it's complicated in a while :-) , then to jessicaaa's for american idol i think ... 
i love my cat because she never judges , easily forgives , and the best part , instead of scolding me for sleeping in she's next to me snoring lol ... 
it would help me to know , do i stand in your way , or am i the best thing that you've had , weeee are young , heartache to heartache we stand , no promises no demands , love is a battlefield ..... ~ pat benatar ( just heard on american idol , sounded decent , awesome song ) 
seriously , when i was a kid and wanted to grow up , i soooo underestimated how complicated life can be . at this point , i'd be cool going back to age 5ish again ....

Two more days of Staters then it's Disneyland on Monday yaaay :-) 
Loved Community tonight . Funniest show on tv ! 
The worst feeling is suddenly realizing that you don't measure up . And that , in the past , when you thought you did , you were a fool . 
going to sleep at < PROPFEMALE>'s because apparently i won't be on time for disneyland tomorrow if i don't ... prob a good idea i need some cheering up anyway . :-( 
Sometimes someone says something really small and it just fits into this empty place in your heart . 
i hate being siiiick :-( 
what's with all the < PROPFIRST > day commercials ! every kiss does not begin with < PROPFEMALE > :-( 
the worst thing about being lied to is knowing you weren't worth the truth .... hmmm true words . 
players only love you when they're playin .... 
you're not as messed up as you think you are , your self absorbtion makes you messier , just settle down and you'd feel a whole lot better , deep down your just like everybody else . 
so ... today was as bad as i was expecting it to be , in fact .... a little worse . silly me for getting my hopes up and getting up early for work just to do my hair for someone who didn't even care . can't wait for vday to be over . 
i don't wanna go to work , i just wanna sleep all day . uuugh . manic monday . 
I've offiicially adopted the orange and white cat that hangs outside as my outside cat that i pet and feed when i come and go . his name is < PROPFIRST > . 
my goal tomorrow is to rearrange my room , and possibly declutter it . we shall see how it goes . i think i want silk sheets like < PROPFEMALE > Butler 
you know that facebook group talking about how < PROPMALE > hardy made it easy to spot douchebags ? well , worse then < PROPMALE > hardy is all that so cal and tap out nonsense , and nautical stars eck . when i see a car with a tap out sticker on it , i cringe . true story . ha ha . 
The Lightning Thief was really good I enjoyed myself . :-) . Lessons learned today , believe me . It must be hard to be in love with someone that kind of just whores around all the time ( literally ) . Jusss sayin . 
Watched the mens figure skating for the Olympics at < PROPFEMALE > Haines house .... they all have really nice butts . Its kind of amazing . 
got my room all moved around and my new comfy comforter :-) ... now its time to do the taxes 
and through timeless words and priceless pictures , we'll fly like birds not of this earth and tides they turn , and hearts disfigure , but thats no concern when we're wounded together ...

uuuuugh . i don't even want to get out of bed today . they don't call em terrible tuesdays for nothin .... 
some times in our lives , we all have pain , we all have sorrow , but , if we are wise , we know that there's always tomorrow .... 
Constantly giving in to these moments that just bring me down , just bring me close enough to stay around ... but I won't stay around ( TSA : < PROPMALE > Maker's Greensong )

That fire you ignited Good , bad and undecided Burns when I stand beside it Your light is ultraviolet 
did i mention , i don't really like wood floors , yet i moved into a house that only has wood floors ? mopping sucks . i'd much rather vacuum . that is all .

be safe . be happy . ... thanks but i'll be happy when i'm over you :-/ 
Whenever they say it can't be done , remind them that they make a jellybean that tastes exactly like popcorn . ~ John Mayer 
Someone come over and kick it with me . Boredom ensues .... 
Jess : my potatoes taste like they've been sitting all day . Me : Damn lazy asses . 
Him : You should go to urgent care first thing in the morning it will be quicker . Me : I hate urgent care , unless I'm urgently bleeding from my liver I aint goin .... On that note , anyone have home remedies for the worst sore throat in the history of sore throats ? 
home now , can't get meds till tomorrow since walgreens doesn't accept union insurance which is nonsense , so instead I got everything I could think of to help an badly infected throat , I did go see the runaways tonight before urgent care which I'm sure didn't help the being sick thing but it was totally worth it cuz that movie rocks . Nite eveyone . 
feelin better ... throats still sore but not nearly as bad as it was .... now i'm just restless 
I wanna be in a band ... i can't sing so ... someone should buy me a guitar then teach me how to play it :-)

I really love those lunch breaks where I have too much other nonsense to so that I don't even get time to eat . Ya ... its awesome . Too bad I don't have one of those magic ebt cards , cuz then I could just not have a job and I could be at staters right now buying 60 dollars in chips , popcorn , cup o noodle , and < PROPFEMALE > with it just like one of my customers today ....

i feel like the build up for glee has been to much and i'm not yet prepared to watch it .... so its just sitting here on my tivo ... hmm ... what to do . 
So , looks like I'm working the rest of the week . Which makes Monday my only day off , I'm exhausted already but at least it'll be a good paycheck next week .... right ?

About to go see Kick Ass with some of my fav people :-) 
Omg ... stinky lady is here and it's a hot day .... Fml . 
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one . ( true story ) 
Gonna see Hot Tub Time Machine after work :-) 
Things I've realized this week : Don't substitute paper towels for toilet paper when you run out . I always have weird dreams when I fall asleep on the couch . 
When you do something you shouldn't , even if other people aren't judging you , it really doesn't stop you from judging yourself . True story . :-/ 
Hot Tub Time Machine was < PROPFEMALE > funny , I love the 80's ... and < PROPMALE > Duke :-) 
It is the highest form of self-respect to admit my errors and mistakes and make amends for them . To make a mistake is only an error in judgment , but to adhere to it when it is discovered shows infirmity of character . 
Sooo sick of lies . Especially when a person stands by their lies more than their truths . And especially when they only consider you a friend based off what you do for them , not even do so much as buy . It's exhausting . It's stupid . Grow up because I'm not buying it anymore . I'm over it . 
What you call insanity I call inspiration -glee 
I think the wind is gonna blow my house over . All Wizard of Oz status ... :-/ 
But seriously , you don't really have the right to act holier than thou or act like Obama is the anti-christ when your getting alot more support with him than you would McCain and Palin . Now I respect republicans and democrats alike , don't get me wrong . But if you are going to live liberally , atleast have the decency to back up your liberal president . 
Otherwise , get off the welfare , work for you food and housing , and then you can trash talk Obama . Thanks . 
Stars shining bright above you , night breezes seem to whisper I love you , but in your dreams whatever they be , dream a little dream of me .... Just got done watching one of my favs of the coreys , dream a little dream :-) 
Finally got my windshield wipers fixed :-) , I guess I should get my car washed now ha ha ... 
Recent events have made me question my faith in humanity . Just sayin . 
Well , I don't know , but I've been told , you never slow down , you never grow old . I'm tired of screwin up , tired of going down , tired of myself and tired of this town . ~ Tom Petty

Trust is like a mirror , you can fix it once its broke , but you can still see the crack in that mother fuckin reflection . ~ Telephone by Gaga and Beyonce 
we the kings old album was like last summer's anthem . hearing their new stuff makes me all nostalgic . the ataris always did that to me too .

Action speaks nothing without the motive ( myfortunecookie ) 
The last boy that I loved he was a low and lusty liar , set my heart on fire but made me choke . His beauty was a sight to see , but he didn't save it all for me , I found other fires by following the smoke . I wish that he had either cared for me or let be me , but he chased me from mind and from my home .... if love is really all we need , then my singing is never gonna save me . Music is my substitute for love . ~ Frank Turner

Just got back from seeing Nightmare on Elm Street in the dbox seats with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hogg and it was way cool . Makes the movie way creepier . Now I'm kinda scared to go to sleep .... 
at some point involuntary outside attacks to your self esteem are supposed to be humorous right ? And not make you feel shitty ? I'm waiting for that point . 
so ... pretty much all of 2010 has sucked . today was no different . i hope the rest of this year goes by fast because i'm already over it . 
I like when family plans things at the last minute and then I end up having to work ... oh well mothers day isn't a big deal right ? Not like I have one . 
The problem with people who only want what they can’t have is that once they have what they want , they don’t want it anymore . 
I'm gonna assume a dead bird in the stairwell of my house was a bad omen ... 
We have come to the conclusion that I like a little ... eh ehm ... chocolate in my milk . :-D 
He used to fingerpaint on the walls with his poopy , we called him poopcasso -snl 
they tell you that the garden of < PROPFEMALE > was perfect but you couldnt even eat off the apple tree , and for heavens sakes look out for that snake , lying to your woman constantly ... adam must have scratched his head , looked up and said , \lord this just isnt doing it for me \"" 
You don't have to be the Dalai Lama to tell people that life's about change 
I love when the lines get super long at work and the managers get all stressed , I just wanna say thanks for that extra help you didn't schedule now you have to come up here and check just like the rest of us . 
do ya ever get a text from someone telling you the start of what your sure to be an interesting story , so you text em back to get this story going ... totally forget about it and then remember it hours later when said person is sleeping so you have to wait till the next day to hear about it .... ugh ha ha . 
Oh oh , I want some more , oh oh , what are you waiting for ? Take a bite of my heart tonight . ~ Animal by Neon Trees . I love this band ! Okay , I need to go to something that matters now ....

My best work friend is moving and now I'm sad :-( you don't realize how much you'll miss someone until there actually gonna leave .

The first step to better times is to imagine them . ( my fortune cookie ) 
Filling out my FAFSA and going back to school . Boom .

RIP < PROPFIRST > Hopper 
It sucks when you feel like you have no one to talk to anymore , no one that understands . 
when you got nothinn , you got nothin to lose , you're invisible now , you've got no secrets to conceal , how does it feel , to be on your own , with no direction home , like a complete unkown , like a rolling stone . ~ bob < PROPMALE > 
Just had my first experience with a \Fast Frank\ " that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > grandma gave her .... it's a hotdog cooker . " 
darlin you don't deserve me , you don't deserve my love , i had plenty to give but you shrugged it off . darlin it aint easy for us to say goodbye , but i just hope that we'll have better lives . ~ zee avi ( darlin ) she's my new fav singer . 
There's an infomercial on for extenze , and they are advertising \women's extenze\ " am i missing something ? i don't think women need to extend .... " 
It's the 1st of the month , you know what that means ... all the \classy\ " people are in Staters today ... :-/ " 
i want a cinnabuuuun .... < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > should bring me one when she gets off work .... 
Trophies are like herpes , you try to get rid of them but they just keep coming , ha ha man I love glee 
That young terrorist went on to become the first gay president of the united states ... abraham < PROPMALE > -glee 
Wooo hoooo < PROPFIRST > brought me a Cinnna Bun cuz she loves me , and it was mmmm mmmmmm good . Now back to bed , thanks Stacizzle 
Only the good die young 
The best temperature year around is a warm heart and a cool head ( fortunecookie ) 
i'm off tuesday , feel free to make plans with me . especially plans where i don't have to pay ;-) 
Ha ha , I like how the censors got totally f**cked up while < PROPFIRST > Facinelli was droppin the F Bombs during the MTV Awards . Awesome . 
Slow dancing in a burning room 
Stater Brothers is the crabgrass in the lawn of life . 
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait , some say it's better but I say it ain't . \ 
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints , the sinners are much more fun ... only the good die young ;-) 
Had fun wataching The Lost Boys and Glee , and looking through the yearbook with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hogg man we get sidetracked a lot ha ha . Still fun though . Can't wait for Beetlejuice saturday ! 
Sooo not looking forward to work at 9am tomorrow , I don't even like the fact that 9 has an AM .... seriously .... :-( 
Guy just proceeded to hit on me , then ask if he can buy the service deli food with food stamps . Yay me ... :-/ 
So it looks like I'll be seeing Twilight , New < PROPFEMALE > and then the midnight showing of Eclipse , triple feature at the Ultrastar June 29th with < PROPFEMALE > Haines , but its all good because < PROPMALE > Black rocks my socks :-D 
it seems like its getting harder to believe in anything , than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts ... ~ paramore 
Today is soooo blaaahh .... I'm sure tomorrow will be fun though , Beetlejuice at Cinespia and possibly Porto's , well see how it goes . :-) 
Last night was cool , met a new friend and watched The Boondock Saints for the first time haha . Now I'm gettin ready to go to Cinespia to watch Beetlejuice with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hogg and < PROPFEMALE > Haines 
Okay , no Beetlejuice because there was a billion more people there than last time :-/ but we still had fun at Porto's before & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > after . Too bad I dropped my second Porto's pastry as soon as I walked in the door when I got home :-( no bueno . Did you know that some < PROPFIRST>'s have bars ? Apparently < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hogg didn't .... and < PROPFEMALE > Haines had her first picnic . :-) 
So today was like one of the shittiest days ever , I think it might be time for me to transfer stores . When your up in the office at work crying for an hour it's usually not a good thing . 
Life in general , I'm so done with a lot of people and thier unnecessary bullshit . It seems like the people that say they don't want drama are the ones that like to cause it . I'm lucky for the small handful of friends I can trust , and I guess the ones I couldn't at least taught me a lesson . 
And for the people from the past and the present that seem to just hate me sooo much for no good reason , I hope life bites them in the ass and they finally get whats coming to them , and I wish they would just get out of my life . True story . :-/ 
singin ' don't worry , about a thing , cuz every little thing , is gonna be alright .... ( people are no longer gonna be harshing my mellow ) 
Sure would love a Cinnamon Roll at 6am ish .... Hmmm who is up that early that could bring me one ..... I think her name starts with an S and ends in a Y .... 
I love horchata 
Anyone wanna go see the midnight showing of Toy Story 3 tonight ? 
Toy Story 3 was awesome . I'm sad it's over . :-( p.s sucks seein the person you still like with someone else oustside the movie #bleh

Happy Fathers Day to < PROPFIRST > Smith < PROPFIRST > Butler , < PROPMALE > Guzman , < PROPFIRST > Renteria , < PROPFIRST > Dempsey , < PROPFIRST > Sers and any other Dad's I'm friends with that I missed . Hope you guys all have a good one . 
And of course Happy Fathers Day to my Dad who needs to get a facebook < PROPFIRST > Caminiti . One of the best dads out there . Always been there for me , even though he was a young Dad did everything he could for me , and still does . Even though we don't see eye to eye all the time he's my Dad and I love him . 
can't sleep , alot on my mind . 
Back to school , back to school , to prove to Dad that I'm not a fool ... - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ( first day back at school tomorrow in like 2 years , wish me luck )

< PROPFEMALE > Butler < PROPFIRST > Davidson okay , so I come home , and I go to the garage to let < PROPFEMALE > do her thing , and this massive huuuge man eating bug came running at me like a spider monkey from the garage , chased me across the kitchen , I couldn't find any Raid or anything so I tried to use Windex but he was too strong ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Butler < PROPFIRST > Davidson so me and < PROPFEMALE > got him cornered in the bathroom , I slowly waited for him to come out , came at him from behind with your < PROPFIRST > Colbert book ( sorry it was the closest thing I could find ) and smashed him like nobody's business . I'm pretty sure I saved us all from what could have been a tragedy . So your welcome . :-) Okay goodnight .

I find it very odd , that I speak out at work about unfair things going on , and then a few weeks later I'm transferred . Nice to know you can talk to your managers . 
I hate when everything changes , I just need something to stay the same for a little bit . Stability , balance , security ...

So , I'm reading the comments on the Daily Press website about the gay marriage ban being overturned , and of course they are all from close minded conservatives with negative things to say .
