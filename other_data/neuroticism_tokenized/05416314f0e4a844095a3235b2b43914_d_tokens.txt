In order to truly appreciate the greatness of < PROPFEMALE > you have to leave it ...... Personally I'd rather just not appreciate it . 

$20 cartons of smokes , $5 cuban cigars . 
Just got me a full fledged Mr. T mohawk . It's not exactly in army regulation , so I will probably have to cut it off . I will be sure to take so pics before they make me though . 
I'm all hopped up on caffeine and nicotine . It sucks when those two are the only substances you can legally abuse . 
I get to drink two beers on June 14th because it's the Army's Birthday . I don't think I have to tell everyone that I am super pumped . 
Why do some people feel the need to put overly personal stuff on the facebook news feed ? Keep that shit to yourselves people . 
Operation New < PROPFEMALE > is way cooler than Operation Iraqi Freedom . 
New Years resolution for 2011 . Don't Eat a grilled chicken breast for at least a decade . 
Tonight was supposed to be < PROPMALE > and cheese night . There was no < PROPMALE > and cheese . If they pull that crap thirteen or fourteen more times I'm gonna say something to somebody . 
is tired of sobriety 
I may have overestimated my alcohol tolerance 
I'm back in Iraq . Hell Yes . 
one more day and I'll be through . 
My first arrest of 2011 I get mud on my pants . Terrible start to what I was hoping to be a mediocre year . 
Don't eat Burger < PROPMALE > after 2 a.m. It does terrible things to you . 
However low a man sinks he never reaches the level of the police . 
Thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes , except < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( I still hate you ) . I always like to think of everything I've accomplished in my life on my birthday . It was a depressing fifteen seconds of my day , but the steak and cake was awesome . 
I like it when crack heads deny smoking crack . It makes me smile , on the inside . 
224 < PROPMALE > to New Orleans . 
Harrah's was added to the very short list of casinos where I broke even .
