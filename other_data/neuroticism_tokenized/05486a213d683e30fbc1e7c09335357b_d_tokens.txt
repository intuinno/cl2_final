My favourite band member of Versailles , < PROPFEMALE > You , just died . I'm in shock and I can't stop crying ...

It's amazing how fast wikipedia articles are edited . It's also amazing how anyone had it in them to type \(deceased)\ " next to < PROPFEMALE > You's name . " 
chest hurts ... tear ducts are sore . the worst part about having someone you love but weren't close to die is that no one understands why you're so sad . 
Having my mom accuse < PROPFEMALE > You of overdosing was not something I needed . He was sick , not a freaking druggie . 
the definition of \parents\ " in the dictionary should be \ " people who will never understand you \"" 
movies & out to eat with kat today :DDDD 
I think Labyrinth might just be the best movie ever haha . < PROPFIRST > Bowie ( was ) pretty good-looking .

So tired , so glad it's the weekend . Also , everybody go listen to \Dear God\ " by Avenged Sevenfold . Just heard it last night and it's already one of my favourites . " 
Stupidity : An important human asset 
I scorn Tokio Hotel . 
If there's anyone who doesn't enjoy sarcasm , odds are they're too stupid to understand it . If this offends you , the odds are most likely against you . 
ssssssssssslllllllliiiiiiiippppppkkkkknnnnnooooooottttttttttt

i don't want to go to bed yet but i'm dog tired and i have a cough ... i hope i'm not getting sick ! D: 
Refusing to accept change is like refusing to get older ; it'll happen anyway , like it or not . So it's best to take it with dignity and grace .

I hate NCIS . It seems like I'm one of the only ones whose good taste in crime fiction lives on .

Oh my God . Driving = awesome . Driver instructor = not so awesome .

stupid werewolves ruining all the fun 
John : Wanna play a shooting game ? Me : Uh , no . John : Why , cause you're a girl ? Me : No , cause you're a douche . This is why lots of girls don't like video games .

sick :( can't go to my concert tonight :( 
Hmm . Grandparents coming over . Time to review the old duck and cover . 
Don't try to convince other people . Of anything . Ever . You'll save yourself a lot of trouble . 
How was The Vampire's Assistant ? I missed seeing it . :( 
You know it's going to be a bad day when you start it with pulling your neck so badly you can't even turn your head . 
They need to sell optimism at Walmart . :( 
666 friends ??? :O 
I love Cozy Cozsazhi , Kat < PROPFIRST > , Addison Bevis , < PROPFIRST > Wu , and < PROPMALE > Lanshaw . :))) <3 <3 <3 
So I like to avoid conflict ? How is that a bad thing ? 
Question everything . 
uuuugggggh i am so freaking annoyed -.- 
Really didn't feel that great today ... and still upset that I missed the < PROPFEMALE > Gap trip >.< 
\Idk\ " is the most insightful answer to a question I have ever received " 
very sick ... i hope i don't have the flu ... 
Happiness and sadness lie too close . 
Hiccups ! :O 
Hope everyone enjoyed Christmas ! 
I don't see why people accuse me of being alone all the time when no one ever has time for me in the first place ... Words like \loneliness\ " don't have any substance until you're experiencing it yourself . " 
Watching Silent Hill . >.> I love that movie ! 
Oh my God . RIP \The Rev\ " . DDDDD: " 
You don't have to pretend you care about me anymore . 
I'm so SICK of this . 
Mmmm feeling shitty . My throat is raw and my stomach hurts ... not going to homecoming afterall . :/ 
Is a little sad . Oh well , everything happens for a reason . :) 
Throughout my entire exam I had \Zydrate comes in a little glass vile ... \ " in my head . Repeatedly . Just that one phrase . " 
Tired .... did not like The Lovely Bones . :( 
Found Korean notes in my literature textbook ... cool :D 
I'm a mentalcase :D 
Would say something insightful but is too freaking tired . 
Loves < PROPFIRST > Wu <3 <3 <3 
yummy snooooooowwww 
My life lesson of the day : Deep down , everyone is a total asshole . 
has the best sister in the world <3 
Something's wrong with < PROPFEMALE > ... she's lethargic and she can't jump up on the couch or the bed without help . I'm worried . :( 
Is laughing at all the complaints about the new homepage ... once you figure out where everything is it's much more organized and convenient . 
< PROPFIRST > Jun Ki makes me miserable because he is gorgeous D: 
is so indecisive . First I like something then hate it , then like it again , then hate it again . Wow . 
feels like playing mahjong for some reason ... good thing i have it on my desktop :D 
There are people I really wonder why I even bother to stay friends with . 
just finished watching The Ring and is now terrified of TVs , people with long black hair , circular objects , flies , trees , ladders , wooden chairs , bathtubs , horses , nails , wells , water , and cassette tapes :DDD 
Watching Schindler's List alone in my parents ' room . Not the most romantic movie , eh ? :P 
feels absolutely terrible 
Since my last message was along the lines of a death threat ( and while I am still incredibly angry , I'm not going to stoop to this person's level and let them have what they want ) I'm revising it . Whoever is spreading rumors about Kat and myself knows that they aren't true , and so does everyone else who knows us . Just because I'm being nicer doesn't mean I'm going to be tolerable if it doesn't stop immediately . 
Listening to the Shrek soundtrack while working on my Civics paper ... lol :D 
Watching The < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show !!! 
They are Night Zombies ! They are Neighbors ! They have come back from the Dead ! Ahhhh ! 
Loved < PROPFEMALE > Kutcher in The Butterfly Effect . <3 But enough of intense movies , I'm watching UP next ! 
What the heck . Right after I become a fan of < PROPFIRST > Sinise ( whom I absolutely adore ) I have a creepy dream about him burning to death . Wow . 
stomachache D: trying to finish this danged science test . 
Is done wasting her time on people who constantly let her down and also annoy the shit out of her . :) I got a life , why don't you try it ? 
feels like a regular squished possum in the road 
throat paaaaaaains D: geeez , thanks Colbie !!! jk jk 
What's on my mind ? < PROPFIRST > Rzeznik :P 
is sniffling and coughing and absolutely hating this cold 
feels freaking rotten . i hate colds . 
' s voice is gone ! whooo ! 
is mind numbingly bored . 
I know I have a good dog because she likes Skittles lol . 
Mmm watching the second season of Hell Girl . Sad , but I like it . 
sad , but not in a bad way . bittersweet ? 
Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections . 
A funeral isn't a ceremony for someone's death , it's a celebration of the life they led . < PROPMALE > Davidson 1909-2010 
Cried just watching trailers for the movie Precious . I wonder what I'll be like when I actually get to see it lol . 
Soooo .... why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ?

TORNADO WARNING YAAAAAAAY 
Ugh . I hate secret life of the american teenager . it should be called the secret life of a slut who gets knocked up at band camp . 
? Only love , only love can leave such a < PROPFIRST > ? 
I hate girls that look like boys ... gross ! 
Bored , feeling gloomyish 
Pink is way better than Lady Gaga . Just a fact . :) 
All I want to do is travel but my parents are the biggest homebodies ever . Go figure . 
is in hate ~ 
Washington DC tomorrow . I get to wake up at 5:30 in the morning wheeeeeeeee 
will soon throw her laptop across the room if it doesn't stop freezing up 
Today's philosophy : You be nice , I'll be nicer . You be a bitch , I'll be a bigger bitch . 
Toodles ! ( it's amazing that I'm this cheerful this early in the morning ) 
3 days away from my asshole brother were not enough . 
Is pathetic :D The plot of the movie The Time Traveler's Wife made me cry lol . 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this ~ Will you be in the 7% that will and leave it on your status for at least an hour . It's Special Education week .??? 
is gonna cut a bitch 
Feeling very much like jumping off a very tall building . Why is it that the person you want to care most always cares the least ? 
turnip 
there are some people out there who seriously need to lay off . you only get one < PROPMALE > at life so why screw it up by being horrible to people and making enemies ? 
I'm so .... DUN DUN DUN ..................................................... bored 
\There a only a few things that I hate more than people who will commit whatever means when the ends benefit only them ; on the other hand there are only a few things I enjoy more than seeing people who get hurt by those means get up and brush themselves off . \"" 
Just had the most fun ever lol . 
Doesn't particularly feel like babysitting a 16 month old this morning . Oh , well . Too late . 
I've been sitting here for about 20 minutes now , and I just realized that I'm wearing earphones and not listening to anything . Blond much ? 
If you compare yourself to others you will become vain and bitter , for there will always be greater and lesser persons than yourself . 
Hope all the moms enjoyed their time off from scrubbing toilets . Don't worry , we'll let you have your job back tomorrow . 
There are insane people , and then there are REALLY insane people . Such as those with more than two kids . 
the deepest hatreds can be caused by loving too much . 
Desperdo by the Eagles is the best song . Period . 
<3 ' s her mom 
There are forces trying to keep me from watching Hannibal Rising . Sometimes I hate the internet . 
O- one\ 
B- big\ 
A- ass\ 
M- mistake\ 
A- < PROPFEMALE > 
Once you're used to being alone , it's not so bad . But sometimes it would be nice if someone cared . 
< PROPFEMALE > of the Damned was okkkaaaayyyy , but Interview With a Vampire is much better :D 
Addison Bevis is the best person ever :DDD <3 <3 
Like or dislike the name < PROPFIRST > ? 
And my horrible mood increases indefinitely . 
In an insanely bad mood . 
NEVER watch Last House on the Left . It's the sickest , most disgusting movie I've ever seen . 
\I think I'd like to give a message to the young people of < PROPFEMALE > . And that is : We shall continue to abuse our position and f *** up the mainstream . \ " -Bono " 
For the time that I've been given , I am what I am . 
Is an ugly , insecure , literal and figurative misfit . Great . 
Had sooo much fun at the masquerade ball :)))) 
Uh ohhh . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > has joined the ranks of the celebrity NSFW . 
I opened my computer and it blasts the Macarena . I'm still trying to figure out whether or not this is some kind of sign . 
Don't cry because it's over . Smile because it happened . <3 
I love Glee lol , but all the character are sooo messed up . 
\If the people \ 
Too bad the market's so awful right now . I'm really ready to get out of Salisbury and move on to bigger and better things . 
Since more girls go to college than boys , you can stfu and make ME a sandwich . 
So . Bored . Hate . Waiting . 
IIIIIIIIIIIII get to go to choral camp and do what I do bessssttttttt <3 
I'm HOOOOOOME !!! NCSICA is the best choral camp on the planet . If you like to sing and you're interested just ask me about because you'll really enjoy it :) 
Without being made stupid by melodramatic choreography , I've decided that the song Dust in the Wind is actually pretty cool . 
I love that my dad loves Uncle Kracker lol 
I love the times when I actually like being me . 
Brown and orange people are creepy . Pale skin is a lot prettier . I wish my arms wouldn't tan like they do -_- 
This is probably going to get me killed , but I hate Lil ' < PROPMALE > , he's disgusting , and he deserves his jail sentence . 
got tickets today to see The Goo Goo Dolls on 8/10 :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 
is going to Williamsburg , VA and the Biltmore house with < PROPFEMALE > Cass , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Murphy , and < PROPFEMALE > Whitaker < PROPMALE > later this month . My lazy summer suddenly got busy . 
Who the hell are < PROPFIRST > Guetta and Gucci Mane and why is their crap popular ? People with taste are becoming seriously few and far . 
< PROPMALE > Boy has to be one of the most beautiful songs ever written . <3 
Has anyone seen The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ? Worth a watch or not ? 
I love how people who don't know me well think I'm so quiet and serious and act shocked when I say or do something funny . I'm actually the biggest goof around lol . 
Finished watching Splice today . Loved it . 
Tragedy is a reminder to take off the blinders , wake up , and live the life we're supposed to take up . 
You can dream , so dream out loud . 
Is having an ultimate dream come true . Is going to a U2 concert in Philadelphia . Next friggin year . D: I don't know how I'm supposed to survive that long . 
Williamsburg was hot . Not in a necessarily good way . 
Wants to smack somebody with a McDonald's cheeseburger . 
Watching V for Vendetta <3 
Inception . Oh my God . 
The stupid thing WOBBLED . ( like this if you know what I'm talking about :P ) 
' Lady Gaga is a piece of fruit . \ -My niece Haylee " 
Just got my < PROPMALE > textbook . Yay for independent study classes . -_- 
< PROPFEMALE > , seashell eyes , < PROPFEMALE > smile , calls me . So I sing a song of love , < PROPFEMALE > . - < PROPFEMALE > , The Beatles\ 
\ 
I love that song <3 
It's official : I'm marrying < PROPFIRST > Rzeznik . 
Totally wants to go to another concert like , right now . I could live at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater . 
Loves The Who <3 
It's refreshing to forgive . 
Well , today sucked . At least there's only five more minutes of it left . 
Creepy fans ruin everything ever . I can't look through any of my favorite actor's photos without getting creeped out . :P 
Kat's coming over and she's bringing Shutter Island with her . :DDDDDDDDD 
Catch Me If You Can vs . The Departed . Which is better ? 
So , I saw Vampires Suck . Funnier than I expected . 
Had a yucky day . 
Ever feel like doing something kinda crazy just to see how people react ? 
Has great friends . What more do I need ? 
To everyone whose ears stick out like mine : don't wear hats . just don't . you look like dumbo's long lost twin . 
My dog < PROPFEMALE > just had a seizure ; does anybody know what could cause seizures in dogs ? 
I . Love . The Misfits . 
Watching the < PROPFEMALE > and the Frog <3 
9 years later and the pain is still just as strong . 9/11/01 
Blood < PROPFEMALE > is an amazing movie ! A good mix of action and emotion . 
A moment of love , even in a bad man , can give meaning to a life . 
I've got that feeling . You know . The one where I'm FAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLIIIIINNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG . 
Thinking today will probably suck . 
is obsessed with U2's Zooropa CD . 
Carowinds with Kat < PROPFIRST > tomorrow ! :D 
Fireflight , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , Kutless , AND Casting Crowns live . What a night . :D 
OH MY GOD I GET TO MEET THE GOO GOO DOLLLLLSSSSSS 
I've been blasted back to the time where I thought all boys were gross and cootie infested . Feels good . :) 
A lot of people claim there isn't a God because if there was , there would be no wars , or poverty , or hatred and things like that . What they aren't considering is the fact that we can't blame God for the things we're doing to ourselves . 
I think I'm having an allergic reaction to Price's homework . :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
Thinking the whole sweet sixteen thing isn't so sweet unless you actually have some friends . 
Homeless go without eating ... Elderly go without needed medicines ... Mentally ill\ 
go without treatment ... Troops go without the proper equipment ... Yet \ 
we donate millions of dollars to other countries before helping our own \ 
first !!! 99% of people on facebook won't have the guts to re-post \ 
......... this ..... WILL YOU ? 
Crappy day is crappy . 
Sounds so cliche , but think about how your actions will effect other people . RIP < PROPFIRST > Shephard , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and all the other countless victims of bullying and cruelty . 
Choir @ 7:30 with Kat < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Chamberlain :D 
I like it on the floor next to my shoes . 
Way to ruin a perfect weekend . 
Will be posting pics of the Goo Goo Dolls concert later , as soon as I find out where to download the meet & greet pics . >:] 
Say what you want , but the movie Labyrinth is timeless and < PROPFIRST > Bowie's mullet is absolutely beautiful . 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . Our wish is that people will understand being gay is not a disease or a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% wont copy and paste this .... Will you ... make it your status for at least one hour ? Promote Love ... & Acceptance ! NOT HATE . 
I . Hate . Drawing 3-point perspectives . 
JUMPIN ' ON THE BANDWAGON : [ I dare you to put this as your status ! ] Whoever likes my status first : I will change my last name to your last name for a week :) 
I believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible , it says : if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of My Father , at The Gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , repost this ! 
Supertramp <3 
I be pimpin ' my new diamonds . PS- Thanks so much for all the love on my b-day . :) 
HIDE YO KIDS , HIDE YO WIFE 
Somebody needs to put the Duggars in a mental hospital . 
Put this as your status if you know someone , or are related to someone who suffers from being a Clemson fan . Being a Clemson fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for Clemson fans and sympathy alone does not help , but we can raise awareness . 90% of Clemson fans won't repost this because they don't know how to copy and paste :o ) 
You look beautiful today , so smile . :) 
Twitter is experiencing a hiccup . 
Thanks to < PROPFIRST > Salmon I've had Hairspray songs raging through my head all weekend . 
Listening to Pink < PROPMALE>'s \Brain Damage\ " and Supertramp's \ " The Logical Song\ " on a loop has turned me into an unintelligible lump of goo and I like it . " 
Might have discovered her purpose . 
Is about to watch The Linguini Incident . I <3 < PROPFIRST > Bowie . 
Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hold up for a sec . You're doing homework , and then you're going to bed ? AND you want people to text you ? NO WAY !!! 
Weeellll . < PROPMALE > Paisley is hot . 
\Dwelling on the past is unproductive . \"- < PROPFEMALE > Smart\ 
Night out with < PROPFIRST > yyyyaaaayyyy :DDD 
So Megamind was hilarious , despite the fact that it was another movie with blue people in it . 
I think , therefore I'm single . ~ Lizz Winstead 
There is a huge , huge , HUGE difference between \your\ " and \ " you're\ " . I will automatically assume that you're an idiot if you can't distinguish between the two . " 
CHOOOOIIRRRR 
All of my hair is GONE :D 
Listening to Bohemian Rhapsody makes doing homework so much easier . 
Reading something with a happy ending was wonderfully refreshing . :) 
The Linguini Incident . Seriously underrated and now one of my all-time favorite movies . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! :) 
I just read a < PROPFEMALE > of \mylifeistwilight\ " . I've never felt more like a superior being in my life . " 
is officially ADDICTED to < PROPMALE > . <3 
I . Hate . Colds . 
Dayquil for breakfast and lunch . Lovely . 
I'm determined that today will be a good day . :] 
Watching more < PROPMALE > . <3 
< PROPMALE > Potter with < PROPFIRST > later ! :D 
< PROPMALE > Potter was so-so . :/ 
I love that my dad's watching the country music awards and I'm sitting here blasting Black Veil Brides in the same room . 
So Jell-O is made of pig skin . :| 
Nowadays it seems like trying to be unique is conforming because eveyone's doing it . Just be yourself . :\\ 
Thank you , thin sheet of ice on the road , you've ensured the fantasticness of my day . Snuggling in bed with my dog and a cup of coffee all morning , here I come . <3 
If you think I'm hot , like this status . If you love me , put a ? . If I'm you're friend , put a :) . If you've ever wanted to go out with me , poke me . If you miss me , put a :/ . If you ever had a crush on me , message me saying so . if you think im cute , put a :D If you're not scared , post this as your status :) 
Boredom . My least favorite word ever . 
I love Doc Hollywood ! <3 
Thinks it's a little odd that Christians are the people who should discriminate the least but probably do it the most . 
Not the best day but not the worst . I have no idea if I can make it another five days . 
blerg . blerg blerg blerg . it's 2am . blerg . 
Shopping nearly completed . Whooooo . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!! <3 
omygosh . i got a keyboard :DDDDD SO excited ! i will be the piano master > D 
Stick , snow ! D: 
Two words : Shutter Island . 
Fact : Snow forms when water molecules attach to dust , smoke , or other kinds of dirty particles in the air . So it's probably not a good choice to eat it . 
There are too many people in the world to impress . From now on , I'm just going to be me . I'm excited . :) 
I think I'd rather jump off a bridge than go back to school . ): 
Everything is turning into a massive , steaming pile of crap . 
Doesn't understand why teens are so cruel to each other . 
Bad day . :( I can't stand how tired I am . 
Dear life : You suck . Please go away . 
I want snow . Inches and inches of snow . 
\Today I had coffee that tasted like < PROPFIRST > Murphy's FACE . \ " -the smartest person in the world " 
\If you dream then dream out loud . \"" 
I love < PROPFEMALE > people . And I love being < PROPFEMALE > . 
is going to fail her < PROPMALE > exam :D 
\I'd rather have roses on my table than diamonds on my neck . \ " :] " 
Okay kids , who else is going to fail their Latin exam ? 
No , I'm not as lovely or as popular as you , person I'm too nice to name , but at least I know how to show other people respect . 
Just hiccuped so hard it hurt ! D: 
I would get a cold during the long weekend . I feel horrible . 
You disappoint me , Jets . You disappoint me . 
GOOD GOD WITH THE POKING , PEOPLE 
100 on my < PROPMALE > exam . :D :D :D :D :D 
I saw someone complaining about feminists today . So , do you think women are property and not people and don't deserve the same basic rights as men ? No ? Congratulations ! You're a feminist ! 
If I see one more person use the wrong form of \your\ " and \ " you're\ " I'm going to scream . Do you like making yourself sound stupid or something ? " 
< PROPFIRST > of the Dead :DDD <3 
is playing tetris like an addict . XD 
I'm pretty sure God knows I love Him even if I don't repost spam and chain stuff . :| 
TACKY DAY !!! :D 
Migraines are the worst . :( 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day . Whoooooo . :/ 
Okay , Lady Gaga . You've redeemed yourself with \Born This Way \"." 
Oh hi , nerves . Why you gotta make me sick like that ? 
Surgery went fine . I still feel icky . 
I had no idea my dang FOOT could hurt this much . 
So the only thing capable of making me feel better right now is listening to U2 . So that's what I'll do . 
Plans to be wearing Tulane blue and green this time two years from now . :] That's right . I finally decided . 
It'd be nice if somebody gave a crap . :/ I guess that's too much to ask these days . 
I'm a girl and I think The Notebook is soppy and stupid . Apparently I help make up about . 5% of the female population . 
< PROPFEMALE > Hudson looks AMAZING ! :O 
Goodnessgraciousme . I hope all artists aren't so hostile towards polite and honest critiques . :,[ I mention some weird lighting and anatomy and suddenly I'm a horrid , spiteful person . 
Dear 10 year old girls , \ 
You don't need a boyfriend . Now go play with Barbies . 
I hate Twilight SO . MUCH . It's now IMPOSSIBLE to find any thing else with the word twilight in the title . 
People who don't sing , play an instrument seriously , compose , write lyrics , or have any knowledge of musical theory who say music is their life seriously annoy me . 
Praying hard for Japan . :( 
I'm sorry , but somehow I don't find looking like you're in your early 30's while you're in high school is attractive . So lay off the tanning , girls . It makes you look old . :| 
Dear life , \ 
I hate you . Please go away . \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > 
To all my fellow biology peeps : I flagellate my hair back and forth . 
A man needed a brain transplant . A doctor explained the prices to his wife :\ 
Doctor : You can get him a female brain for $900 , or a male brain for $1500 . \ 
Wife : Why is the male brain so much more expensive ? \ 
Doctor : Well , it's never been used . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Perry , \ 
You were so much cooler before you started copying Lady Gaga's alien freakshow . So quit it . \ 
<3 , < PROPFEMALE > 
Is going to see 30 Seconds to Mars :D 
I really hope I just have a cold versus the flu . :/ 
\A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle . \"" 
No , Facebook , I do not like Gucci Mane , or any other person who talks in rhymes and calls it music . 
< PROPFIRST > Patterson employs ghost writers . Thought you people who are fond of the Maximum Ride series ought to know . 
Well , this has turned out to be one horrible week . 
Soooo I love U2 more than anything else in the world . Even < PROPFEMALE > Hammond . 
Girls who think they're going to marry their high school boyfriends make me laugh . 
dress shopping later . muy emocionado :D 
Running 5 < PROPMALE > on an elliptical is leg muscle suicide . :,D 
< PROPMALE > Leto is fine . That is all . 
Has spent the whole day watching old Disney movies . :D 
Mom's in bed , so I can't voice my frustration aloud . I'll do it here instead : AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG 
Well ... life could be better , but for now it's good enough . 
Oh my God . If < PROPFIRST > C . Reilly is cast as Haymitch I will not see the movie NO MATTER WHAT . 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > Salmon and Kat < PROPFIRST > who were amazing at the spring concert today . :D
