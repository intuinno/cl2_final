Sky is getting so good at using his fork . He claps everytime he stabs the pasta with his fork :) I'm so proud of him . 

Starting over , starting fresh , erasing thoughts of another time , beginning anew ... Let's see where this takes me ... 
Good game Lakers ! 
Had a good night hanging outside around the fire pit . Sky is all tuckered out and looks so cute sleeping cuddling with the blankie . Moments like this bring a big smile to my face . I love being a mommy ! 
Feeling much better today . Had the worst headache yesterday . Lots of sleep and a wonderful hug today helped make me feel better . 
Back From Ashes @ < PROPFIRST>'s Grotto ! Be there or be square ! 
I'm not part of anybody's drama . Hell we're not even friends so leave me out of it and don't try to say that we are . Grow up and take some responsibility . 
Because I'm < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and I'm AWESOME ! 
Happy thoughts and pixie dust 
Is it 2011 yet ? 
I'm over all of it :) I've moved on :) everyone be proud :) one thing left to do and all will be wonderful again :) I love my life and myself the most :) 
\I'm not perfect but I'm worth it \"" 
Never leave an unfinished puzzle unattended with my son around , he'll chew on all the edges . No missing pieces but the pieces won't go together now :( 
I stand alone ... 
No one knows the life I lead , the things I do , the people I involve , or what goes on behind closed doors . So stop thinking that ya do . 
Chores are almost done ! What to do after that ? I'm already bored * sigh * 
Ice cream and a movie alone ... how exciting is my life right now lol 
I think I've already lost you I think you're already gone I think I'm finally scared now You think I'm weak But I think you're wrong ... 
Woke up quick about noon just thought that I had to be Compton soon ... 
If I leave here tomorrow would you still remember me ...
