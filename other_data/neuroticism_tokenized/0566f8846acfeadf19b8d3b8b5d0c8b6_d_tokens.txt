I'm going to rewatch \Lucky Star\ " over the next week or so . It's so good !!! Like spicy chicken gumbo ~~~ !!! = 0 ) " 

Why does everyone talk about sleeping during the rain ? What a waste . Rainy days are such a joy to watch .

\To err is human . To forgive is divine . \ " \ 
I sat outside during my lunch break ( at about 6:50 pm or so ) . It was quite < PROPFEMALE > as I watched the clouds drift past the half < PROPFEMALE > . I also saw a few flashes of lightning in some of the clouds . 
I'm going to Mr. Gatti's to play Pump It Up on Saturday . When I do ... I think I'm going to try ... Bemera . Somehow , I think I can survive it . Whether I actually will or not is a different matter .
