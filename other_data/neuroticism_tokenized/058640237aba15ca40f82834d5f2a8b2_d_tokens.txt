is wishing the weekend could be the rest of the week too ... Monday comes and reality sets in like a punch in the face . 
' s week is getting better ... more hectic and crazy , but better .

Here are the standings : < PROPMALE > beer , 1 . < PROPFIRST > , 0 . 
middle of the week - hoping for a good , laid back weekend . 
< PROPFEMALE > , i dropped my phone in a glass of juice ... i may be out of touch for awhile while i figure out what i need to do to fix it . 
Sunday , bloody sunday ... 
Demain , dès l’aube , à l’heure où blanchit la campagne , Je partirai . Vois-tu , je sais que tu m’attends . J’irai par la forêt , j’irai par la montagne . Je ne puis demeurer loin de < PROPFEMALE > plus longtemps . 
It puts the gas in my truck , butter on my biscuits , A couple bucks when I'm itching for a scratch-off tickets ... 
Has a date with Weeds season 4 tonight . 
Work , then Karaoke and Dancing with Dar and < PROPFEMALE > ! I love our little bar ... minus the creepy guys . 
Hanging out at home ... watching National Geographic . Church tomorrow morning , then ... who knows ? 
hey hey ! Gophers win at Illinois ! hooray ! 
Damn cat knocked over the plant ... dirt all over the white carpet . fantastic . 
Ghost hunters and facebook ... what more could a girl need ?... 
off to work ... then a meeting this evening . 
I gotta get out of here ! It's like I'm tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck being packed with fertilizer and fuel oil , pushed over a < PROPMALE > by a suicidal < PROPFIRST > Mouse ... 
Working on eggs for Easter ... check out my photo album for pics of them ... 
Know what totally made my wednesday better ? Brand spanking new episode of Ghost Hunters !!!!!! 
I broke my heel ... again . Now I need a new pair . And my hockey team is losing . And I'm apparently being ignored by someone ** ahem ** . That's my crappy trifecta ... 
ok ... crappy trifecta has been resolved . All but the broken shoe . I still need a new pair of heels for work . Maybe a run to Target tomorrow morning ... 
is going to relax for a change ... nothing is going to get done tonight . 
It's Pi day ! 3.14 !!! 
I'm feeling better ... still feel a little funky , but better . Planning a great St. Paddy's day ! Pre-game starts tuesday , baby !! 
Hi Ho ... Hi Ho ... it's off to work I go ... but i'm not looking forward to it . Read the news ... you'll understand . 
more easter egg-ness . I have to make like , 20 of them before easter ... and then I have to varnish them . Can we push easter out a couple of weeks ? Would anyone really mind ? 
Let the days of basketball induced stupor begin . March Madness , Baby !!! 
Working this weekend ... looking at houses ... busy busy busy . 
my NCAA bracket is kicking butt and taking names ! 
Busy sunday's suck ... and i miss someone ... alot . 
is feeling lonely . 
Laundry ... the bane of my existence ( among several other things ) . 
Sleepy ... that's the dwarf i am impersonating right now . 
Yeah ! I found my < PROPFIRST > Buble CD and i've been rockin ' out all day ! 
The day started out really badly ... but has since gotten better ! 
church , then work until 6 , then free as a bird . 
I'm so confused ... 
Had a great morning , almost smooshed 2 animals with my car , and now i'm ready for bed - not a bad hump day . 
hmmm ... i don't know how i should feel right now . i'm torn between several emotions and none of them are very logical . i need to start channelling Spock . 
Do you still like me ? I just need to know ... for my own piece of mind and to convince myself that i'm not unloveable . These are the kinds of posts you get from me at 3:30 in the morning ... the dark enhances introspective thought . 
longest day ever . 
It would be an amazing day for a bike ride . No wind , no rain , blue skies and sunshine ... perfect . 
Where is the on switch for my brain ???? And who turned it off in the first place ???? 
Silvan easter ... sigh . 
Oh , Lordy . Save me now ... 
Whew ... made it ! Time for a long walk with my puppy ! 
I have a poison song stuck in my head ... it's going to drive me crazy all day ! 
... The old man is snoring ... ' Ugh ... you snore!' 
I just saw a giant rat run accross the parking lot at work !! ICKY !!!!!!!! 
At the drive in ... in the old man's ford . Behind the bushes ... until I'm screamin for more . In the basement ... lock the cellar door and baby ... TALK DIRTY TO ME !!! ** Yup ... still stuck in my head . Why is it so darn catchy ?? ** 
Days like today make me wish i was independently wealthy . It's too nice to be inside !!! 
I think I need a karaoke night with my most favorite people . I know they won't all be able to be there , but I can settle for a select few ... you down ? 
Running errands with my puppy , work until 8:30 , then hopefully < PROPFEMALE > ing out and relaxing with some friends ! Text me if you want to < PROPFEMALE > out !! 
To sum up the last few weeks : Men can be more trouble than they're worth , work is boring , and i got a puppy . Now for a nite of fun to offset the crappy ! 
Ok ... here's the plan : sargeant pepper's in oakdale for bad karaoke , waffle fries and beer ! Let's everyone show up and be rowdy ! 
I made chicken noodle soup from scratch ! Yumm-o ! 
Gonna relax , have a drink or two and < PROPFEMALE > out with the hubby and some good pals ... what a way to end the week ! 
I'm having a pizza dinner with < PROPFEMALE > , then I'm home alone - peace and quiet , i get the remote and computer to myself , and I can actually get things done without someone in my way ... it's not all bad . 
So ... breaking news : my car window got busted out at maplewood mall . Last time i let < PROPFIRST > touch my car . 
Dropped my car off and managed to get to work on time ! Dang , i'm good ... 
I'm in the mood for sweet and sour chicken from < PROPFEMALE > chin ... but no one will eat it with me . :-( 
This is the craziest week ... and it's only Monday ! What next ??? 
When life gives you lemons , you make lemonade . But what happens when you don't like the lemonade you made ? 
Mmmmm , sliders . Just had a wonderfully creepy dining experience at White Castle . Guy in the next booth was staring at me the whole time ... I feel dirty and violated ... 
It's raining , it's pouring . The old man is snoring ... he went to bed and bumped his head and didn't wake up till the morning . 
I want your love and i want your revenge .... you and me could write a bad romance ... 
It's been an icky , boring , lonely week ... 
Boys can suck it ! I'm spending a night with my girls !! 
I like the feel of your name on my lips/ And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss/ The way that your fingers run through my hair/ And how your scent lingers even when you're not there ... 
Just saw a cute guy < PROPFEMALE > a nice little buell pop his clutch and almost drop his bike ! Hahaha ! Made my day .... 
Bowling with my family ... a no drama , easy friday night ! 
Now i'm home for the night ... jammies and a good book !!! 
Yahtzee , baby ! 
At < PROPMALE>'s cabaret ... it's an interesting experience ... 
I've become addicted to the show Overhaulin ... I love pretty cars and big engines ! 
Band name of the day : Bubble Mishap ;-) 
I do what i gotta do , workin that 9-5 ... it's killin me but then again it's keepin me alive ... 
I'm going to be completely selfish this week and not worry about ANYTHING ! I'll still be nice to everyone though ... 
I've lost control of the TV remote and I'm REALLY BORED !!!!! Someone entertain me ! 
Woo ! $200 dumped into my car this morning ... 
I'm really confused by the phenomenon of Counter Steering . How is it a two wheeled vehicle can be steered in one direction and move in a completely different one ? One of you smart engineer-math-architect guys need to explain this to me ... 
The Dweebs are at The Blue Fox in < PROPMALE > Hills tomorrow nite ! 
They've turned a Green Day album into a musical ? What the heck ... 
Hanging out with my girls ! Bet you wish you were here ... 
Date night at Applebee's . Trying to salvage the week with good Thursday and Friday nights ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Puppy now knows her name , Sit , Down and Come ! Working on Roll Over and the ' Leave It!' command ... she's all kinds of crazy smart ! 
Gearing up for the Festival of Nations next weekend ... also looking for a new apartment I can afford ... 
Work today . then two days off !! What in the world am I going to do with myself ?? 
Yay ! Did some karaoke ... some crazy people watching , too . Our karaoke bar cornered the market on crazy tonight ... 
I love it when foreigners try to yell at me ... it always ends up being funny ! 
Take my breath away ... 
I'm as corney as kansas in August ... 
Hmmm ... hubby's asleep and I'm bored . What to do ... what to do ... 
Stuck at work , then back to the Festival of Nations later tonight . 
I still need a date to the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit at the Science Museum ... anyone up for it ? 
Working long hours while not wearing a shirt has made me sick :-( 
Why do i always end up getting lost ?!!! I hate it ! 
Omg .... I'm leaving work and actually caught a glimpse of the sun !!! 
I totally just now figured out that my printer has < PROPMALE > feed capability ... i've had it for a year . That totally made my night ! 
Chillin ' with the Gretzky and a good book . Finally , some R and R !! 
I feel bad for the chaps who rode motor bikes to work ... it's chilly ! Wait ... no i don't . They have bikes . I'm jealous ! 
If anyone wants to see a smokin ' hot girl tonight i'll be at Throwbacks in woodbury rockin ' out to Arch Allies ! 
Someday , love will find you . Break those chains that bind you . One night will remind you ... 
I have a totally free saturday ! Hubby's at work , laundry is getting done ... call or text if you want to < PROPFEMALE > out ! 
What an icky day . I just feel really blue today .... I need a < PROPMALE > to cheer me up . 
Is feeling better after dinner with < PROPFEMALE > Silvan - she always helps me put things in perspective !!! 
I feel like Eyore today and i'm looking for someone to pin my tail back on ... 
Wish < PROPFIRST > luck for his interview today ! Everyone cross your fingers and send out good vibes ! 
The chick serving our seminar at greenmill totally has a < PROPFEMALE > gosselin haircut ! 
I'm playing the stepford wife and hating it .... I need to be independantly wealthy so i can hire a maid and cook . 
I miss the sound of your voice . And i miss the rush of your skin . And i miss the rush of the silence as you breath out and i breath in ... 
Well , at least my car looks pretty and shiney after all this rain ! Although it's always pretty when i'm in it :-) 
Someone reminded me how much I adore < PROPFIRST > Buble yesterday ... so I had to dig his CD out of my car and listen to it on repeat all day long ! I just couldn't help it ... thanks a lot Old Man ! 
I would like to announce to the internet that i thoroughly enjoy beer ! 
Getting my hair done up all cute , the apartment is clean ( sorta ) , i get to wear my new dress again and I get to see some person/people that I haven't seen in awhile ! What a day ! 
Why all the games ? 
When a heart breaks - no it don't break even . 
What you've got boy is hard to find - Think about it all about it all the time - I'm all strung up my heart is fried - I just can't get you off my mind 
So I ate lunch on the patio in a tank top and my back is TOTALLY sunburnt ... owie :-( 
Went to the bathroom and unzipped my skirt . All of a sudden , my ring slipped off my finger and fell right in the toilet . At least the toilet was clean ... 
What the heck ... the twins had their butts handed to them by the sox , and the CELTICS and LAKERS keep winning ( btw i'm very sad for the Suns after last night ) . Sports suck right now ... Who wants to see the Celtics win ?! Well , bostonians do , but they're insane so they don't count . 
I'm gonna be in lots of pain tomorrow ... i can already feel it . But i feel great today ! 
I'm just a little black rain cloud , hovering over the < PROPFEMALE > tree ... 
zzzzz ... 
I get to go to what should turn out to be a gorgeous wedding ... too bad she didn't get a warm < PROPFEMALE > day . 
I like a girl with a short skirt , and a looooooong jacket . 
Woo . Sitting in orientation ... can someone please keep me awake ? 
Really ?! The Celtics had to win again ? 
I hate storms . I am so scared of them ... I can't help it . It must be biological or something . Maybe it's a trait that natural selection proved effectively increased survival rates . 
Days like this make me HATE that I have a desk job . I belong outside !!! Gah !!!! 
It don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite . Hop in the water and cool ourselves from the heat of the night - baby get ready .... ooooooh ! 
Jeez ... You could feed a third world country with all the venison laying on the side of the highway this weekend . Gross . 
I love the drive to the cabin ... except when crazy rednecks yell at me in a gas station parking lot . 
Thinks fishing with worms is gross ... i'd rather use minnows ... they're less icky . 
Fish count : one bullhead , two perch , one broken line by a northern and countless bait robberies . 
Back in the cities - but I brought home a pretty nice sunburn as a souvenir . Come visit at the pet store ... i'll be there ' till 8 tonight instead of hanging out at the pool . 
Rain is a good thing ( but I still don't like thunder and lightening ) . 
is a little angry right now .... Apparently I suck at life and can't do anything right , and today was officially ' Complain about < PROPFIRST>' day at home . \ 
\ 
on a more cheerful note , my little sister's surgery on her knee went well and she might be home tomorrow . Now is the best time to prank her ... she can't come after me ! haha ! 
New day = clean slate . 
Hubby is watching baseball , cat is cat-napping , dog is chewing on a bone , birds are sleeping ... and i'm bored out of my mind . 
so tired ... just want to eat and watch tv ... 
Is playing modern warfare 2 with her baby brother .... it's actually a pretty cool game ! 
Is watching hockey !!! 
I'm rooting for the underdogs . Go flyers ! 
Is home from work and now off to the gym ... nothing like a good run to work off the stress of the day ! 
Hates driving in the rain . 
I'd rather be fishing ... 
At the gym ! Run , < PROPMALE > , run ! 
Is watching Man vs . Food ... grody . 
Crazy day at work ... At least the weekend is almost here ! Anyone doing anything fun tomorrow night ? 
Watching < PROPFIRST > play video games is the MOST BORING SATURDAY EVER !!! Someone save me ! 
Wine and the new TruBlood ... what a great evening ! 
Yummy ! Homemade fetuccini < PROPMALE > ! 
My acrylic nails have < PROPMALE > on for 2 months ... time to forcibly remove them . 
The first testicular guard ( cup ) in hockey was used in 1874 . The first helmet in 1974 . It took men 100 years to figure out their head was also important . 
Already wishes she was done at work ... and she just got there . 
I need a drink ... 
Sooooo full . Won't have to eat for days , now . I'm like a wild lion ... gorge and starve , gorge and starve . 
What a start to the week ! Is it over yet ? 
Wine and tv . A good way to end a Monday . 
Is stuck inside on this beautiful day . 
Is the week really only half over ? For real ? 
Men are stupid sometimes . You think they've grasped a concept , and then ... nope . Back to square one . 
Here comes the sun , la la la la ... here comes the sun ! 
Arch allies at oakdale summerfest tonight ! Hopefully it won't keep raining ... 
Arch Allies was great , as usual . It would have been better if < PROPFIRST > Silvan had been willing to dance with me . At least I had < PROPFEMALE > Silvan and < PROPFEMALE > Lanoux Brandt !!! 
Hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > , the Mighty Wiener Dog !! 
sooo glad to be home ... but not glad to be all alone ... 
Is anyone interested in going to see the MN Lynx with me ? I get discounted tickets through work and it would be a fun , cheap outing ... 
has a fishing license and would like to use it this fine 4th of July weekend ... anyone up for it with me ?? 
was in a weird mood today , and was reminded of someone she hasn't seen or talked to in awhile . It's kind of bittersweet . 
Watched a guy try to break into my car last night ! I called the police , but he got away ... 
Quarter end was horrible !!! 
I'm just gonna roll with the punches ... crazy changes in store . 
House hunting ! 
Working out , then movie and popcorn at home with the husband . Maybe going to Fort Snelling tomorrow to celebrate our country and the wonderful men and women who serve it . 
O ! thus be it ever , when freemen shall stand\ 
Between their loved home and the war's desolation ! \ 
Blest with victory and peace , may the heav'n rescued land\ 
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation . \ 
Then conquer we must , when our cause it is just , \ 
And this be our motto : \In God is our trust . \ " \ 
Happy 5th of July , everyone ! I hope everybody survived the 4th in one piece ! 
Either cat or < PROPFEMALE > chewed through our hdmi cable ... great . 
It's soooo nice out ! Why am i stuck at a desk ????!!!!!!! 
I'm like the < PROPFEMALE > opposite the hypotenus . Always right . 
Wishes Better Off < PROPMALE > wasn't being cancelled . LMAO !!!! 
Rollin ' throught < PROPFIRST > Prairie ... on our way home ! 
To market , to market to buy a fat pig . Home again , home again , jiggity jig ! 
Soooo sunburnt . I'm going to have the most amazing farmer's tan . 
Is feeling restless . Animal Planet and facebook until i decide to fall asleep . Boring . 
Goodnight my angel time to close your eyes/and save these questions for another day . \ 
i think I know what you've been asking me/I think you know what I've been trying to say . \ 
I promised I would never leave you/and you should always know/ wherever you may go no matter where you are I never will be far away . 
Is pissed off ! Why am i the only one who can manage to actually come to a conclusion and make a decision ?? Seriously . I've laid out all the facts and given him all 3 possible options . JUST FREAKING CHOOSE ONE !!! 
Another evening with TruBlood , wine and the man who loves me !!! 
So ... my \day off\ " didn't quite turn out to be a day off . I'll just have to try for some ' < PROPFIRST > time ' at a later date . I hate having to raincheck myself !!! " 
McDonald's french fries are the best when you're having a crappy day ... yummers ! 
Just had a three hour conversation with < PROPFIRST > , trying to talk him through a decision .... just to conclude that we weren't going to change our minds . My husband is so special ( but I say that with all the adoration and love that a wife can ) . 
Yay , storms ! I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight ! 
Super tired ... and a really boring week is ahead of me . 
A quick trip to the library , breakfast , then packing for the big move ! 
I need a hero ! He's gotta be stong , and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight ! 
Sister date with dar is rocking my flip flops off right now ! I love crazy , friendly drunk people !! 
I know a place where the grass is really greener ... wet and wild , there must be somethin , in the water !

Thunder In the Valley !!! I heart Lumberjack Days !!! 
This week SUCKS !!! I wish I could have curled up inside < PROPFEMALE > Silvan's suitcase and stowed away on vacation with < PROPMALE>'s family 
It's going to be a very sad day ... My birdies are going to a new home . Hugs would be appreciated . 
Is currently homeless . As much as i liked our apartment , our house will be so much more like home when it's done !

Half Life at Throwbacks ! 
Everyone says the first year of marriage is tough . No one tells you the 2nd year is tougher ! 2 year anniversary was today and I LOVE my hubby !!!! 
Why do some people feel the need to twist things and cause drama ? Seriously ... I'm not stupid and I ALWAYS figure out the source . I'm like friggin ' < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
It's almost fall !!! I busted out my hipster scarf today !

Everything is put away at the new house , our furniture was delivered , waiting for our washer and dryer ! Now to bring the animals over , one by one . 
It feels like fall ! I love it ! 
Our state fair is a great state fair ! Don't miss it , don't even be late ! 
I got kissed by a horse ! 
Riding the SkyRide at the state fair ! 
If you're too fat to walk , you're too fat to go to the fair and eat . 
I made it the whole day at the fair without spilling anything on my shirt ! 
My first ever Vikings game ! 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFIRST > !!! 
I'm gonna kick one of my coworkers in the face pretty soon ! 
$300 To fix my car window . This sucks . We should go back to horses ! 
Grooming puppies at Petland ! I'm COVERED in short , sharp dog hairs ... itchy !!!

Petland pets make life better ! Work till 3 , then dinner with my love ! 
Work , then a walk around the lake with the puppy , then working on my Ren Fest costume ! 
Work , work , work . 
My puppy is NOT gonna want to go potty in the rain ... 
It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt . 
Is making curry chicken for the hubs !!! 
Ren Fest !!! It's < PROPFEMALE > weekend ! 
Might be getting sick ... but hopefully not ! 
Working at Petland all weekend !

Off to work again ... maybe i'll treat myself to my favorite spot in the city this weekend ... 
I like it on the living room floor ! 
Working on the house this weekend ... gotta get ready for winter ! 
The Twins are done for the season .... now I can turn my attention to Football ! Can't wait for some good College Basketball to get going , too ! 
Was made aware of quite the ' learning opportunity ' at work . Time to fix it and start fresh tomorrow ! 
Wish i had a motorcycle to ride fast and wreckless . 
Painting the garage door ... eew . 
Can't sleep ... watching TV . 
I wish i were a derivative , so i could lie tangent to your curve . 
Painting , playing with the < PROPFEMALE > , laundry , making dinner , working on some < PROPMALE > - that's my Saturday ! 
Oh . My . Word . Even though the Vikes won , the last play of the game was , well , a little ridiculous . 5 lateral passes ... it was like watching a PeeWee game ! 
My socks glow in the dark !! 
It is perfect snuggling weather ... Oh how I love fuzzy blankets ! 
I'm thinking about setting up a reef tank in my living room ! Any thoughts ? 
At Fogo de Chao for a work meeting ... amazing !!! 
I don't think i could possibly put another piece of meat in my mouth ... 
I'm gonna decorate for halloween this weekend !!

I wish it were warm out ! Hail the Vulc ! 
The < PROPFEMALE > rain ruined my Mums last night :-( 
Happy Birthday to my puppy ! She's one year old !

Whoo ... Great Halloween party last night , then got up today and pulled all the Buckthorn out of my back yard ... looks amazing now ! 
It's soooo nice out ! I should be home raking my yard ! 
Remember fondly those who are in a better place . Happy All Souls ' Day . 
Why do i always end up with the new person when i'm in a hurry ? 
Had to get my < PROPFEMALE > fish flavored food instead of chicken ... now he's trying to bury it like it was poo ... 
I really wish I had my paycheck so I can buy groceries ... 
Dammit ... It's snowing . At least there is Christmas music on the radio !
