is experiencing Murphy's law . Its been a downward spiral since the afternoon with two workshops and three hours of tutoring with a sore throat . Then the evening allowed me to burn my finger , get stuck in mud , ruin my favorite flats , and wear bags on my feet so I could run to the tub . I hate Thursdays .
