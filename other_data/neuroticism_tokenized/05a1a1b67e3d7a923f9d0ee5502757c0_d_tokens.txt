My life just stopped in its tracks . No , I'm not dead , but time just stood still . I keep waiting for it all to resume as it was , but I know that will never happen . The world is frozen . At least I am , anyway . I don't notice the days going by . I want so badly to be dreaming . But I know that this is reality ...

about to do homework ... =s 
i am sooooooo bored !!! 
Such exorbitant duress A contingency to abscond Surfeited with esprit ... I <3 vocabulary !!! 
Okay , so today I fell out of bed , hit my head on my desk , and broke my CD player , all at 3 am .... Was this a bad day ? 
Esprit ....... with a mixture of fear and pain ...... Impenetrable shield of nervousness .... 
I feel like Rogue today ... 
just made a bowl of intant noodles without blowing up the microwave !!! 
\Nevermind \"" 
Coolio . 
I find myself too archetypal ... 
Never set your alarm for 3 am ..... 
says that < PROPMALE > Rund is the worst friend ever !!! 
The loud creak you hear in your ears when you swallow ... 
A tear in a contact lense ... 
Extemporaneousness ! 
Blue bird laughs from a fallen tree , sunset burns on a quiet sea , sold my soul and they ran me down , there was NO < PROPFEMALE > , there'll be no milk as sweet , sweet ... NO < PROPFEMALE > by Iron and Wine 
La la la ! Hiding shame with masquerade of smiles and oblivious laughs ... 
is watching The Guild while drinking orange soda with strawberry and watermelon twizzler straws !!! 
What a crazy random happenstance ! 
< PROPFIRST > , you're driving a spork into your leg ... 
It's a brand new day and the sun is high , all the birds are singing ' cause you're gonna die ! How I hesitated now I wonder why ... it's a brand new day !!! 
The GUILD season 3 is da bomb ! 
\I'm running on one foot !!! Whooaaa ! I'm running on one foot !!! Ow ! Noooooo ! It hurts ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > and Saphire ( < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ) " 
3 days !!! 
aiiieeeeee !!!! i actually have to finish the songs i write !!!! i have a deadline of next monday !!!!! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s slpovr today !!!! soooo excited !!!!! get to see all the friends i rarely see !!! 
On the fly !!!! ( talk show ) Status Quo !!! ( status quo ) 
Horrizons kiss the clear blue water while the branches among the evergreens sway to the coastal breeze ; the grassy plains < PROPFIRST > a lazy day by the glowing old lighthouse up the hill ... 
texting < PROPFIRST > ?! 
As we wait for the dusk to fall and the sun to arise at < PROPFEMALE > and we fall into a deep sleep with a bi tiresome yawn we hope to awaken soon sleeping under the stars and < PROPFEMALE > ... -Sleeping Stars ( the trilo-bytes ) 2006 
that peaceful night , tears in both our eyes , seperating truths and lies , sobbing silently , while i give my quiet plea , just to forget , all of my deepest regrets , taking the strands of time to twist , and resist , a fallen , broken heart , our words , now torn apart , writhe in the sunset's agony , tangling < PROPFEMALE > ... 
i'm soooooooo frustrated that i have to wait 2 more years until i can get a job !!!! 
Can you release what follows your everystep , day or shine , but not let go of the tattered thorns beneath your feet , desperately grasping for something to hold onto ...? 
C > C > C > C > C > Tears .... < ) < ) < ) < ) < ) 
With perfect clarity a voice rings , high above the gentle whisper of humanity . The speaker , foresaken among hell's tongue , sheds the weight of anxiety and rises to meet the sky with a delicate embrace ... Nothing is impossible ... 
I cover my ears and scream at what I see , for I can't look away . I'm perfectly fine , but I cannot say the same for the poor girl staring blankly at me with glassy eyes , hands over her ears . T'is then I realize that I'm looking at my reflection ... 
I cannot change you . I cannot earn your trust . You may be disappointed if you fail , but you are doomed if you don't try ... 
Off to destroy the enemy's blockade !!! 
We're strong as hell but not hickory rooted ... 
\Light tends to hide from me . But that's okay . I've learned to see in the dark . \"" 
Today , I fell down the stairs . I landed on my knees . When I stood up , I realized I had fallen because my shoelaces were tied together . I am weirded out because I just tied those shoes to my feet , and I don't have younger siblings that could do that to me . MLIA 
\Shed the blank look on your face for a smile and a half ... \"" 
I cannot believe my eyes . How the world's filled with filth and lies . But it's plain to see , evil inside of me is on the rise ... 
This appeared as a moral dilema ' cause at first it was weird though I swore to eliminate the worst of the plague that devoured humanity it's true I was vague on the ' how ' so how can it be that you , have shown me the light .....? 
L-O-V-E is a mystery !!!! < PROPFIRST > is here !!! 
Hanging Out With < PROPFIRST > , The Awesomest Person Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just shoved Icecream in < PROPFIRST>'s face !!! 
is shooting a music vid today ! Aaaaaiiiieeeeeeeee ! Soooooo nervous !!!!! <3 
\I didn't jump . I slipped . \"" 
like i , < PROPFEMALE > , even you , open ur mouth and speak 
I have to speak . I have to open my mouth . But it's so hard to do when you are watching so intently ... 
Close you're eyes . Breathe . Don't hear . Listen . Don't feel . Sense . Don't bite your lip . Forget everything . Except for me . Don't let time pass . Let it fly . Release your heart . Cut ties to the world . Rise above me . Let go . Don't look down .... 
I am alone . I walk with only my conscience on my shoulders . Care to join me ? 
When we fall , we are all given nets , but our doubts destroy that , and we crash ... 
Ima gonna cry ! I am alone , bored and uber pissed at me mum !!!!! 
Curiosity killed the cat . Thank God I'm not of the feline nature ... 
SAVE MY HEART ( save my soul ) 
Alone and lacking < PROPFEMALE > , my hiding eyes , leaking frost . It's cold , but there is no shelter . I'm waiting for something , an answer , at that . Burried beneath the icy roads . I am incapable . I search for an escape , but there is not one possibility . Free my caged mind and release the seldom following cries of life flooding back into existance ... 
I just wanna hide in my closet until everything goes away . 
I can't hear myself think . But my mind is empty . So there is silence . 
I'll wait . I guess I don't really mind . I'll play along . It's kinda fun . To pretend , that is . 
This is my first Saturday alone since the end of September ... Loneliness has never seemed more depressing ... Or boring ... 
Someone tell me y i have chorus songs from 2 years ago stuck in my head !!! 
I woke up early , but now I'm sleeping in ; my head aloft in the clouds , dark thundering clouds , sending a lightning bolt down to Earth , striking the souls of every living beast , saving the worst fucked up soul for last , my own . Crushing the skulls of the innocent , for the lies I tell have been thrown in my face , too many times . I've been abandoned , forgotten as if I were only a day of someone else's life ... 
Words hurt and hate ... 
Life is at a standstill ; I barely notice the days passing ... 
I remain ignored , secluded from these strange beings ... I always knew I was different , that I didn't belong . I don't mind not fitting in , just the resentment is a torch to my heart ... 
You don't belong here ... You should go ... Leave . 
Okay , so you've done everything you can to ruin me . What now ? 
Be :-)) $ 
I turn out the lights , but the snow outside my window glows bright ... I can't help but keep my eyes open ... <3 
I speak silence . I have words to say . But I don't know how to say them .... <3 
#532500 
I wish my tears were just water ; so that they didn't sting my eyes ... <3 
Though I longed for a < PROPMALE > to start over , everything was thrown in my face . I cannot change . Perhaps with long term whatever , but I don't have much time . And I'm not that patient anyway ... <3 
It's not that I lie a lot ... I just that when the words flow out of my mouth , I barely notice if they're not true ... <3 
Post-it notes make me smile ... ;) 
When I closed me eyes and fell backwards , no one caught me ... I wonder why ... <3 
I am a different person ... I broke myself , and I broke everyone else ... What have I become ? <3 
I feel sick :( 
Is tempted to jump ... <3 ;) 
Make me believe that I'm worth it . Let me see myself through your eyes . Then Let me know what you you think ... <3 
I will never forget no matter how much I try ... <3 
I lost all feeling in my hand for a few minutes today ... I still don't know why ... <3 
I'm more of a < PROPFEMALE > than a Daisy ... <3 
I really wish I spent less time around people who aren't in good moods ... <3 
I often find that I am afraid to blink , in fear that this dream will go away and I will wake up to reality . I want to wake up most days . Just not today ... <3 
Not in that life . Not in this life . Not ever . <3 
Death is the temp . job and life is the vacation ... 
Why do I feel that someone is following me ? 
Alone in a crowd ... 
response ability 
Hands braced against the wall , hoping the pain will end . It's all just matter : the dark , the dismal , the shattered , the remainder of a broken soul . Desolate memories , of times without this . The change . The difference . Gone forever . Let go . <3 
Heaven today is but a way to a place I once called home . Heart of a child one final sigh as another love goes cold . Once my heart beats to the rhythym of the fallen snow . Blackened below that river now flows a stream of molten virgin snow . For the heart I never had . For the child forever gone . The music flows because it longs . For the heart I once had ... <3 
I wait for your eyes to bleed and wounds to shed tears ... <3 
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens . Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens . Brown paper packages tied up with string . These are a few of my favourite things . 
I don't know much but I know this for certain . That is the sun poking its head ' round the curtain . Now please can we leave ? I'd like to go to bed now . It's not just the sun that is high in my head now . I'm not trying to say that I'm smelling of roses . But when will we tire of putting **** up our noses ? Don't like staying up , staying up past the sunlight . It's meant to be fun and it just doesn't feel right ... 
What is your weapon of choice ? What's your weapon of choice ? There is a weapon to free us all . I won't waste it ! I won't waste it ! I won't waste my love on a nation !!! <3 
Darling , what is going on ? Honestly that never happened . Lying is your favourite passion . Leave me , go where you belong . Higher heels and lipstick napkins . Dying is your latest fashion ... <3 
metaphors , semi-colons , comma splices , paradoxi ... <3 
Curled fingertips resting upon the edge of existence . They tell you not to let go for anything . But you're slipping , and you don't have the strength nor the will to save yourself . By the < PROPFEMALE > , you'll have fallen ... <3 
I speak the truth . But you still don't believe me . I waited for a response , and yet I knew what you would say . You think I've changed so much , and that you barely know me anymore . As if I'm a different person ... <3 
Masked by who I once was , I wait around the corner , lurking . You pass by me , smiling at the friendly face you see . And yet , my diguise is wearing thin , and you begin to notice the change . I avoid you , in hopes to replace these chipping layers , but every coat of paint fades in the sun . So I reside in the shadows ... <3 
The melancholic eyes of a traitor . Looking down , avoidning reality's gaze . Heavy fog around glassy stares . Blank but longing looks out the window . Waiting patiently ... <3 
Time passed and the skies darkened . The day came to a bitter end , bright in the fiery inferno of the setting sun . And I remembered just how tired I was . Yawning , and trying to shake the sleep from my slowly closing eyes , I layed my head down for only a minute . I didn't want to doze off this early , and yet , I couldn't escape the sleep ... <3 ZZZzzzzzz 
Everyone glances at me with intrigue and curiousity . But I'm not flattered . I'm alienated , and passed around from person to person . They can't see what I know . I know that every look is hateful , and that every word on their tongues will hurt if spoken . I'm not like everyone else . I just have to accept it ... <3 
I warned you , and now you're really gonna pay ... 
Je ne c'est pas ... <3 
Go ahead and break me , but my other half will destroy you !!!! HIYAAAAAH !!! 
was typing the first chapter of her story , editing it as she went along . But , however , she accidentally clicked cancel , and everything she had just spent an hour and a half typing was deleted and unretrievable , leaving her very upset and cursing at the computer . 
We speak our own tongues , and yet we understand eachother ... <3 
I got my haircut ... ;) 
is unable to believe they called the snowday before there were even 3 inches of snow on the ground ... <3 
Why do we attack ourselves when we don't mean to ? 
Don't criticize the inquisitive ... Because then you won't learn anything ... <3 
Finally im unbanned from my own laptop !!!!!!!!!! FREEDOM !!!!!! 
Walking out onto the snow you step where there are all ready footprints , so you're feet don't get wet . But if nobody had dared to walk on the fresh snow , perhaps for the same reason , you wouldn't be getting anywhere ... 
* Glass tears shatter , like falling hail of < PROPFEMALE > waters -- and fate , the pure unravel , like empty chains unlocked -- and your sorrow * ~ Kusari no < PROPFEMALE > 
With my hopes set high , I reach to the sky , and come crashing down , with my face in the ground , as love fades away , running out of time to say , the same words , even though they hurt ... 
We always go to EXTREMES , I always crush my own DREAMS , I just THINK too hard , and IMAGINE too big ... <3 
I LOVE YOU <3 
PARTY NIGHT !!! <3 XD <3 
STIll w/ my friends . Boredom . But u gotta still luv ' em . <3 
Why do you look away from the things you wanna see ? Why must you walk away from the places you wanna be ? You hurt so much and you might not care ' cause there are feelings you don't share . But if stay too long we'll all be gone and that isn't what you want . What you want ... ~ Stay Too Long ( nameless band ) 
Still has sharpie on my hand . Thank you < PROPMALE > . I REALLY appreciate that ! 
Live Young Die Fast ~ Alkaline Trio 
Too many acronyms ... 
I cannot determine which < PROPFEMALE > is the anti- < PROPFEMALE > . If the real me is like Kirra , then the anti- < PROPFEMALE > is Jacqulynn . But the real- < PROPFEMALE > rarely shows so is Kirra the anti- < PROPFEMALE > ? I am extremely confused . 
I don't hate you but I just wanna save you while there's still something left to save ... 
I still find joy in playing old pokemon gameboy colour games ...

Aren't I amazing ? 
Get mad then get over it . <3 
How do I determine if something is an epic fail or just a faol ? 
Strawberries with cool whip and sugar ... YUM ! <3 
You said things were better , that they were fixed . I don't see the difference . There is always a certain time of day , where every good thing goes wrong . I want to blame you . <3 
<3 Tää jylhä kauneus < PROPFEMALE > ääretön yksinäisyys Lapsuuteni metsän , taivaan Kaikuu se haikeus halki tän matkan Aamun tullen yö tarinansa kertoo Jylhä on kauneus < PROPFEMALE > ääretön yksinäisyyteni Sitä henkeensä hala < PROPFEMALE > a Kehtoni hauta , hautani paikka Erämaan viimeinen on <3

<3 I remember sitting in my tree with a good book , looking at each passerby and waving as they said hello <3 
<3 They pain is fading but the scars are just appearing . <3 
<3 LaDiDa : The word used to represent being in a daze or not paying attention ; the trailing off or lost thoughts when speaking of someone ; the quoting of myself in irrelevant context to the subject ; randomness used to express felicity ! <3 
Climbing my tree ... <3 
I fell out of my tree ... 
<3 The evening slips past my eyes . and sets to the light of the day I despise . I hide my face and breath into my hands . I turn away and give up all for which we stand ! If I could shatter the pieces already broken . I could stop listening to you all of your words unspoken . And if I wait for the day in which you're gone . Why can't I notice before too long ?! <3 
<3 Most blondes are Finnish . I am Finnish . I was born blonde . Damn , I conform to everything ! <3 
<3 New shirt , new shoes , new purse , and new sweater ... Life is good ... <3 
<3 Mint chocolate chip icecream !! <3 
? You turned away when I appeared , and mocked the pain in it's longing song . I hid that so well , the broken pieces , and little did you know my heart lay shattered . We used to just release each breath , exhaling the blood from our throats , as we watched every other person live unharmed . Who changed the colour of the night ? What brought the canopy over our wet eyes ? Why can we not blink away the light ? ? 
Phone confiscated ... Sooooo not cool ... Teacher texts out-of-state friend from phone to say i got in trouble and not to respond ... Pretty bad ... Though the teacher told me that i could get it back at the end of the day , my phone is being held hostage by security ... Even worse ... :'( 
ISS is the worst ... XP 
:-)) $ is happy !! :D 
Heke ? Dingding BOREDOM ! Mega-Q </3 ! 
<3 Live a little ; Have fun ! <3 
<3 Ça ne me dit rien ... <3 
is sad because Antarctica has no capital ... 
<3 The < PROPFEMALE > is as bright as daylight though the sky remains a faded black . The rain is shallow , seldom to fall upon my watery eyes , with the glittery web of tears . Save the last song of the serenade for me , and I shall haunt your eyes no longer ... <3 
Minä rakastan sinua ! 
<3 Be still , my son , You`re home , Oh when did you become so cold ? The blade will keep on descending , All you need is to feel my love , Search for beauty , find your shore , Try to save them all , bleed no more , You have such oceans within , In the end , I will always love you ... <3 
<3 NOTHING can wipe the smile from my face and take the skip from my step !! <3 
<3 Is soooooooooooo happy !! <3 
I iz not so happy :( 
<3 A premature feeling has fallen into a trap , but it is as vital as the oxygen I breathe at night to stay alive ... <3 
<3 I plan to sit under a tree , or < PROPFEMALE > in one to pass the time ... <3 
<3 I just want to paint the sky another shade of blue <3 
</3 If it had been any other day , maybe I'd have been fine ... </3 
<3 Could I have broken the same glass to see it shatter another way ? <3 
<3 All your love is a lie ! You're one-night butterfly ! Hurt me be the one ! Whoever brings the night ! The dark created to hide the innocent white ! Lust of night ! Eyes so bright ! Seductive lies ! <3 
<3 Alone beneath my shallow sky with pursuit of the light in your eyes , I wait , you speak , and I am no longer trapped ... <3 
<3 LOVE <3 
Panini est Canadian ! 
<3 ... I blink my eyes to the tune of the fire , but the leaking brine keeps them closed . Desperate glances to each side , but hell , whoever knows . I paint my face to disguise the pain , but the rain washes it away . Pretending that I've already chosen , my fate , before the end of the day ... <3 
My heart is a little messed up 
Cait brought a lost dog to my house . Made posters . Put them up . An hour later the owner finds us walking by . Lead her back to her dog . Had to take posters down . Up late . Being good is hard work . 
Is finally online . Tired . Bored . Talking to my love :) Wants breakfast . 
Stupid mosquito allergies :( 
Working on paper . Hand written 4 1/2 pages . Single spaced . Needs to type . Ugh . :/ 
Mad at stupid project . Needs a nap . Crying for no apparent reason . Ugh :'( 
Is high on caffeine ! Excited to be done with project ! In good mood ! YAY ! <3 
XP sleepy !! Needs hugs !! Good day so far !! 
Master cleared phone on accident . Is devastated . But relieved . Has pics and contacts on memory card . :/ 
<3 ... Been there , done that , messed around . I'm having fun don't put me down . I'll never let you sweep me off my feet ... <3 
Sick :/

All the birds are singing that you're gonna die ... 
J'ai trop d'intégrité . Je me déteste pour cela . <3 
Say what's on you're mind and kill 
Sometimes in life , we pick things up and weigh down our pockets , and don't even know we're walking around with our pants to our ankles , tripping and inching slowly forward , our hands gripped tightly to the side bars that our concrete walls of life provide only for the handicapped of the ignorant . ( yes , I just said we're half naked ) 
Boredom 
What happens when you can't trust someone ? 
MWAHHahahahahahahahaaa ... No I'm not evil ... 
Why is it that every time I get remotely close to you , you remain out of reach ? 
? I feel the pressure , it's coming down on me , it's turning me black and blue ? 
<3 Now and again she's afraid when the sun returns <3 
Please , remember me . Happily . By the rosebush laughing . With bruises on my < PROPFEMALE > . The time when . We counted every black car passing . Your house beneath the hill . And up until . Someone caught us in the kitchen . With maps , a mountain range . A piggy bank . A vision too removed to mention . 
<3 . Running for her life . The dark rain from her eyes still falls . Breathtaking butterfly . Chose a dark day to leave . Save one breath for me . A Loner longing for . The cadence of her last breath . <3 
? With your fragility displaced . Our memories erased . The beauty of the light within your mind . With your dreams all locked away . Sorry for our rain delay . The water washing your eyes ' til you go blind ? 
<3 ... 3 days ... 3 more stupid days ... <3 
<3 ... Only 20 hours ... I'm sooooo ecstatic !!! Can't wait ... <3 
<3 Perfekt . < PROPMALE > is here . And is wandering downtown . Alone . Ecstatic . <3 
AAAaaaaahhh running through the woods at Bird Elementary for like 2 hours ! Covered in scratches and thorns and mud . But very fun !! :D 
is VERY VERY VERY ecstatic and happy and also worried sick ... 
<3 :'(( Last day :'(( <3 
</3 He's gone ... And I'll never see him </3 
<3 Only slightly better , but still sad :'( I miss him ... <3 
<3 Lalalalala I can't hear you lalalalala <3 
I didn't let myself fall just get back up again ... 
<3 Search for beauty , find your shore . Try to save them all , bleed no more . You have such oceans within . In the end , I will always love you ... <3 
What's today ? 
<3 Is there Life before a Death ? Do we long too much and never let in ? <3 
OMFG ! I'm awesome !

< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Lonsway , < PROPFIRST > Cloud Funk , < PROPFEMALE > Mosteller , < PROPFIRST > Mosteller , < PROPMALE > Rund , and Jefferiah Acocella are all awesome . 
Rough week ... 
<3 We can't both become the same pawn that's made to fall . Oil that tastes like blood stole the summer scent . From me to you you're stabbing me through you . You're stabbing you through him and betting most of this world . We'll add enough of the world ... -Jars , Chevelle <3 
<3 I'll be watching , waiting . Dreadful shaking . Will the storm pass over us today ? Will lightning strike our sins away ? \ 
Watching , waiting . Falling , shaking . Will the storm pass over us today ? Or is our future looking grey ... -Storm to Pass , Atreyu <3 
<3 You were told to to run away . Soak the place and light the flame . Pay the price for your betrayal . Your betrayal , your betrayal . I was told to stay away . Those two words I can’t obey . Pay the price for your betrayal . Your betrayal , your betrayal ... -Your Betrayal , Bullet for My < PROPFIRST > <3 
<3 Up on melancholy hill there's a plastic tree . Are you here with me . Just looking out on the day , of another dream ... -On Melancholy Hill , Gorillaz <3

I'm awesome ! Y'all know I'm awesome , yo ! I love you ! 
You can choose to see outside , or just see the window . Usually , I can only see the outside , maybe because that's where I really am , beyond the hold of any walls . It seems to be a miracle when only the smudged glass sits before my eyes , still and unchanging . I guess I let my dreams remain guarded by a blockade , one that I can see through , though I can never walk around it ... 
Sleep is my new best friend . 
<3 No walls . Can keep me protected . No sleep . Nothing in between me and the rain . And you can't save me now . I'm in the grip of a hurricane . I'm gonna blow myself away . -Hurricane Drunk , < PROPFEMALE > & the Machine <3 
I'm bored ... Seriously ... 
My mind is a radio ; I can change the station . Sometimes I listen to music , other times I just listen to the voices ... 
I seriously am tired , but too awake to sleep ... 
Smart people is my favourite oxymoron . 
<3 So if you love me let me go . And run away before I know . My heart is just too dark to care . I can't destroy what isn't there . Deliver me into my fate . If I'm alone I cannot hate . I don't deserve to have you . Ooh , my smile was taken long ago . If I can change I hope I never know ... -Snuff , Slipknot <3 
After being with someone for a while , it's hard to be alone . 
I hate when the person you miss is the one you need comfort from the most , but they can't , and someone else has to do it ... 
Sleep 
You left me lost again ... Je ne sais pas quoi faire ... Tu dois croire moi ... Vraiment ... Je t'aime ... 
Tell me when you miss me ... 
What good is a cold metal chain around your neck when it pulls you to hell ? 
I'm pretty sure I'm getting better ... Slightly ... My voice is still gone though ... :/ 
YAYAYAYAY I AM BETTER ! ( BUT NOT FULLY HEALED ) :/

And it was your heart on the line ...

Lalalalalalalalalala * ignoring you * lalalalaladidaaa 
:/ being cold gives me a really bad headache ... 
Y'know , just because I act like I don't care doesn't mean I don't ........ 
Yes autocorrect , I kiss toucans . 
I forgot to pick up the textbook I need to do my psychology homework .... In other news , it hurts when you drop our bass on your foot .... Yeah , hanging out with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , watching the snow is not that fun :/ and now that I'm home , I am really tired .... I COMPLAIN A LOT .... 
Mwahaha ... Wait ... what ? 
First school day in weeks that I haven't gone out with friends :P 
How am I today ...? Well , I don't think I can answer that ... 
I tell you goodbye ... And you don't see that it's not forever ... 
Braces off ! 
Seasons in the sun ... Sad song ... 
I find it kinda funny ... 
My dad just said : \Mom needs to eat celery marshmallows ! \"" 
Hah ... Yesterday was fun in < PROPFEMALE > Arbor , but I'm pretty sure the rest of the week will suck ... So if you need me , I'll be asleep or playing video games . :P 
Forgiveness is fickle when trust is a chore .... -I & W 
Let's both forget about , the people we care about ; Tomorrow's just another sun to set ; A fading friend you love ... -A & L 
Listening to good music :) feeling dizzy still but oh well ... I'm tempted to play struggle irl ... I call blue ! Haha random day :P 
I am a musicbox ; a keepsake , not a prize ... A locket of pictures , handful of cat's-eyes ... Awaiting a shelf , I am stashed away neatly ... My layers of dust , growing all but discreetly ... 
People make mistakes ; that's not an excuse , it's a fact ... But nobody should make mistakes ... And nobody should care if you do ... 
Oh look ! A pretty butterfly ...... * Is terrified * ... 
One . Big . Dark room . 
I have a name . I have a face . Why am I anything less than you ? Why am I forgotten ? 
You want honesty ? You will fail school . You will not win the lottery . Your shirt is stupid . You will never do anything beneficial . You are a lousy friend . Now go prove me wrong . 
Hah , fun day with many friends downtown ; scaling walls then a deep meaningful conversation ... Over all I learned that I am too much of a bookworm now XP 
Not feeling well ): but sleep helps ... 
We all have lives that need revising . 
Random day with people ! ' Twas nice to see certain friends be really happy ^_^ and to just sit and talk ... Compared to my normal record of under a minute , it took me approximately 9 hours and 45 minutes before I finished a single 20 oz . voltage :P I'm pathetic ! 
Mtn dew popsicles ! :) 
Ahh nice half-day :) not a bad day with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > I guess . Now for sleep ... 
I can't go a weekend without at least 11 hours of sleep each night ... I dislike waking up ...
