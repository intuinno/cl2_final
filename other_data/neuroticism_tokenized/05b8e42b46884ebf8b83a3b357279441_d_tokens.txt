Procrastination . \ 
It looks like facebook . 
\What are you two whispering about ? \ " Kellyn Maguire : \ " Well ... it involves an ape ... some midgets ... and a candybar . Long story . \ " Me : \ " ... Sure . \"" 
? Baby , it's cold outside ... ( : 
speech is done . \ 
Break , you can start now :) 
I like smiling--smiling's my favorite . :) 
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve ... WHAT ?!?!! 
super last minute Christmas shopping for my sisters :) 
hasn't gone to sleep yet so < PROPFEMALE > probably skipped me since he's too impatient to wait until I'm tired . :) < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
feelin ' like being creative today . 
great day (: 
It would be great if nobody showed up to school tomorrow . It would also give me more time to finish my homework .. 
gonna miss Pretty Little Liars :P but it's cool , cuz I know what happened to < PROPFEMALE > ( ; 
I wish I was born in the 60s ... you know , without that whole \segregation\ " thing . " 
I quit school . \ 
Problems solved . 
heyy speechers , practice tomorrow ? O.o 
This is a joke . Hogwarts only had one set of finals . 
really want to cut my hair again . really . badly . 
I love speech . SASSY&CLASSY (: 
Great start to a great weekend (: 
Still climbing trees , tripping up over fallen leaves but holding hands , no one else could ever understand what it's like between us -- and that's between us . <3 
amaaazing weekend . and with a late start , ill just get my stuff ready tmr ;) 
CAN'T STOP SNEEZING . 
slept for 12 hours ... and could still continue to sleep ... 
putting a considerable amount of effort into not doing Bio . \ 
So what the heck ? I'll do it again . Truth is ... 
has quite possibly the worst work ethic . Ever . 
And I have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the < PROPMALE > ? 
just realized how much I have completely spaced out during Bio . Two days before the test . * party finger * 
If I'm this person you say I am , then why has nothing changed ? 
It's amazing how unmotivated I can get until the very last second . 
When you realize how small you are compared to the world , certain things don't matter . 
broke my glasses , have no idea how I'm going to get through school tomorrow . xP 
Me : Hey , eighth graders , interested in joining the speech team ? Mikey Maloney : No ? Well are you interested in acting ? < PROPFIRST > Moran-Rudd : No ? Well do you like to win things ? Good , now take the dang flyer . 
just got to my house . I suspect I won't be leaving for another 36 hours . Great . 
Me : I HATE STAYING IN THIS HOUSE . I'M SICK OF SNOW . \ 
Mother Nature : DGS just gave you another Snow Day . \ 
Me : ... LOL JK . 
cutting < PROPFEMALE > hurr ;) 
Some coke , facebook , sitting in my livingroom wishing I was asleep but I can't because I finishing my Bio homework ? This is definitely a Sunday night . 
< PROPMALE > Criss , I now deem you most adorable thing on earth . In return , I simply ask that you marry me . \ 
kthnxbye , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Just realized I haven't done my 30 Day Photo Challenge for the past four or five days because I didn't feel like it . then realized this is only really a challenge for procrastinators .. 
So proud to be on a team with such talented people :) CONGRATS GUYS ! KICK BUTT AT STATE ! 
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at . Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at . <3 
? I feel like an < PROPMALE > ist who's lost his touch , \ 
He likes himself in his < PROPMALE > \ 
But not his < PROPMALE > too much <3 
Pretty sure anyone who went to state just woke up in the past three or four hours at least . :) \ 
Congrats everyone ! 
motivated to do absolutely nothing .

All you have to do is think ' Maybe ' ... and then it gets a little better <3 
Running out of time to screw around :/

played some minigolf and watched < PROPFEMALE > Coupland get it in , Christian Moran-Rudd try , and < PROPMALE > Taco Maguire scare some kids at the bottom of the mountain . 
and I love Grace Grannan and Kellyn Maguire . THERE 
You see I'm trying to find my place , but it might not be here where I feel safe . We all learn to make mistakes ? 
Lian < PROPFEMALE > Lucansky just ruined my entire week . 
So hum hallelujah , just off the key of reason . I thought I loved you , but it was just how you looked in the light ?
