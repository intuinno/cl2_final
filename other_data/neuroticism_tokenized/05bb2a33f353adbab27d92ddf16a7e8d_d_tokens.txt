aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh !!! OK , I feel better . 

Happy 4th to everyone !!! To anyone who will , drink one for the fallen soldiers and for those who aould not be here . Without them , we would not have this day to celebrate . 
Boring 4th , sitting at home with nothing to do . 
Don't drink and park . Accidents cause people . 
I'd rather be hated for everything I am than be loved for something I am not . 
Never regret anything because , at one time , it was exactly what you wanted . 
I disagree with < PROPFEMALE > jewelers . I would bet that on any given Friday or Saturday night , more kisses begin with < PROPMALE > Light than < PROPFEMALE > . 
Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day 
Watch your wallets , the leprechauns want their gold . 
Work is so slow
