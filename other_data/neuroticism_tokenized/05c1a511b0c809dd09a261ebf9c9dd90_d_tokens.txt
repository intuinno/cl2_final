Good things come in small packages . 
Is it wrong that I immediately knew the movie 2012 was filmed in Vancouver the second I saw all the Stargate actors in it ? 
I hate when people ASSume things . 
If this country spent half the effort on helping ourselves , as they do helping others , maybe there wouldnt be homeless children in the street .

At your age , you're going to have a lot of urges . You're going to want to take off your clothes , and touch each other . But if you do touch each other , you * will * get chlamydia ... and DIE . 
Raise your hand if you like boobies . Go . 
Why is it that when you tell someone something that's true , Even if you tell them it is , and that you hate lying , they don't believe you ? Is dishonesty that much more occuring these days than being truthful ? What is wrong with the world ?

I don't know what compels me to keep taking these 4 mile walks ... 
Rum is for drinking , not burning . 
Bored . :/

4 mile walk success . Its becoming a common and healthy habit . 
Watching Sister Act ... again . 
I love my computer . I missed my computer . 
Shiny ! 
Bronchitis last month and strep throat this month . What's next ? :/ 
I look at all the lonely people ...

Its amazing how life works . 
I seen a rainbow yesterday but too many storms have come and gone leavin a trace of not one god-given . Is it because my life is 10 shades of gray ? I pray 
all 10 fade away . I seldom praise him for the < PROPFEMALE > days . And like his promise is true , only my faith can undo , the many chances I blew , to bring my lif 
pe with such an enduring pain that it keeps them in the pouring rain . Who's to blame for tootin ' cane into your own vain ? What a shame you shoot and aim 
for someone else's brain . You claim the insane and name this day and time for fall and pray to crime . I say the systems ' got ya victim to your own mind . 
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of comin ' true , believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you . 
Moving day ! Hurray !

I don't want to set the world on fire . I just want to start a flame in your heart . 
We can dance if we want to . \ 
We can leave your friends behind . \ 
Cause your friends don't dance\ 
And if they don't dance\

Tomorrow's another day , and , I'm thirsty anyway ... bring on the rain .

Today was a very productive day . I applied to a million places even Hobby Lobby , where , in the < PROPMALE > section almost had an artgasm . I went to Best Buy and almost had a musicgasm playing this sexy keyboard .. that I must have ... I've probably found a job .. at a THEATER that is literally down the road .

Going out and about with < PROPFEMALE>'s car . I hope I don't get lost . .. .. And perhaps maybe I can find a job .... Yeah . Not getting lost and getting a job . That's on my agenda today . 
I dropped off applications at places where I remembered where to get to . At least two of them seemed promisingly interested . I even went a different way back to the house and didn't get lost . I call this battle a win . 
I've been up since 7am .... and it's Saturday . I was uber productive with the job search -- even though it Saturday and all the important people arent working , and I didnt get lost driving in this grid-like town . Oh , and did I mention I havent slept more than 3 hours ? I deserve some kind of cookie . Or perhaps a backrub . In the meantime , Im on my 3rd cup of coffee . That'll teach my insomnia a lesson . 
I cooked dinner today , in heels . ^_^ 
Give me fuel , Give me fire , Give me that which I < PROPFEMALE > .

Better a < PROPFEMALE > with a flaw than a pebble without . 
Stop trying to control it -- Let it happen . 
Does it hurt more when a stranger tells you you're a bad person , or , when someone you know and love tells you you're a bad person ? 
What does a girl have to do to make an honest living doing what she loves ? 
I made a new friend today . :3 yay .

“Consciousness is the stone that creates the waves in a sea of nothing” 
Human beings are such dynamic creatures . We change so much over a short period of time . In fact , our cells regenerate every 7 years . Someone you knew 10 years ago is not the same person you know today , molecularly and characteristically . They are different .

Five stages of loss and grief : 1 . Denial and Isolation 2 . Anger 3 . Bargaining 4 . Depression 5 . Acceptance .... right now , I'm in-between 4 and 5 . And I know I cannot compete with 10 years ... so , Acceptance is right around the corner . Thank God .
