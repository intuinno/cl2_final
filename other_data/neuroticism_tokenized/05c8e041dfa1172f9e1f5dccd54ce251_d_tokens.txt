Do not dwell in the past , do not dream of the future , concentrate the mind on the present moment . ~ Buddah 
We are what we think . All that we are arises with our thoughts . With our thoughts , we make our world . 
Let your heart guide you . It whispers , so listen closely . 
Thinking of you is easy . I do it every day . Missing you is the heartache that never goes away . 
Every time you look at me and see me smiling , just know that I am thinking of you !

When you are living your life the way others want you to , you aren't living your life at all , but are living theirs . Why sell your goals short like that ? 
Heal the soul first , then healing of the mind and body will follow . ~ Dr. Shaw

Ultimately , \ 
humanity is one , and this small planet is our only home . If we are to \ 
protect this home of ours , each of us needs to feel a vivid sense of \ 
universal altruism . It is only this feeling that can remove the \ 
self-centered motives that cause people to deceive and misuse one \ 
another . 
To meet everything and everyone through stillness instead of mental noise is the greatest gift you can offer to the universe . \

Broke down and turned the heat on last nite . 42 degrees this morning , feels like 33 . 
Since\ 
we < PROPFEMALE > the true happiness that is brought about by a calm mind , and \ 
such peace of mind arises only from having a compassionate attitude , we \

has sawdust in her hair , a guitar pick in pocket and a piece of barstool in hand 
Although\ 
I personally believe that our human nature is fundamentally gentle and \ 
compassionate , I feel it is not enough that this is our underlying \ 
nature ; we must also develop an appreciation and awareness of that fact . \ 
And changing how we perceive ourselves , through learning and \ 
understanding , can have a very real impact on how we interact with \ 
others and how we conduct our daily lives . ~ Dalai Lama
