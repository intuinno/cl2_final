The siren sings a lonely song of all the wants and hungers . Of lust . Of love . Of brute < PROPFEMALE > . The ledge of life goes under .

Rest in peace < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > 11/85-4/10

who come begging to your house willing\ 
to exchange all their beauty and\ 
their elusive madness for the scar on your soul ... 
Just got my first digital cam . It's ridiculously hooked up , a Nikon Coolpix L110 w/ 12.1 MEGA . It was a beautiful gift , and the first digital camera I have ever owned . I'm so happy I could cry ;) 
Got a new job , starting tuesday . You know those pig-ear dog treats ? Yeah , i make those . The ladies love it ... 
Starting at the factory this afternoon . Hope all goes well . Did everyone make it back safe this weekend ? 
Happy National Pelvic Thrusting Day ( for those who participated) !!! 
PAYDAY !!!!!!!!! 
friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question\ 
their friendship . And pick up like they just spoke yesterday , \ 
regardless of how long it has been ........ REPOST if you are lucky \ 
enough to have a friend like this ! 
So I went rock climbing today . Very intense , especially for a born and bred flatlander like myself .

Back from the Great Blue Heron Festival . I stand by my guns on this one- the east coast rocks . 
Hey to all my TCTC 
Hey to all my TCTC brothers- who all is going to be at celebrate ? just trying to get a rough estimate . I'll be there along with Brownie on saturday . 
Back in Chicagoland again . Yet another funeral . Dammit . Dammit . Dammit . This record is broken . 
Fuck . Too many funerals . I think I'm out of energy . 
Thank god for family and good friends . These last two months would have been impossible without them .

If the purpose of mind is to reason , then I say it is a most honorable thing \ 
to lose ones mind . Reason prevents possability by creating comfortable \ 
facades , and splits canvases into dualistic nightmares . I wouldn't wish \ 
a right mind upon my worst enemies . 
In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape ;\ 
Broken branches trip me as I speak ... 
We'd be a walking disaster ... \ 
( just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there ) 
The ground gives in \ 
as expected\ 
and you fall into dust\ 
as before your were a child . \ 
Educate me , \ 
my brave nomadic king ;\ 
To which direction from here \ 
do you see yourself being thrown ? 
I had a dream last night that I understood how to play solitaire ... That was the whole dream . So far , it has already had a profound impact on my life . 
T-minus 7 minutes to episode 1 of \Signals From Innerspace\ " ! Whoooooooo ! Go Luc ! " 
\The earth turns\ 
In the breath of the morning\ 
I keep forgetting\ 
the smell of the warm summer air . \ 
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing . \ 
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement ... 
For the record : Damn the man , save the empire ! Good luck Brownie , you will be sorely missed . 
There is no becoming , no revolution , no struggle , no path ; already you're the monarch of your own skin -- your inviolable freedom waits to be completed only by the love of other monarchs : a politics of dream , urgent as the blueness of sky . 
Sweet gig today , doing some photography for a friends wedding ( her first one ! ) , beautiful weather , clean conscience . Life is good sometimes !

Listening to Schubert's Piano Sonata in A < PROPMALE > , and pretty sure it's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard . Just had to say . It's really THAT good , especially in the third movement . 
Just an open question : Is there anything more meditative then cooking soup ? I mean , really , is there ? 
Oh , the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear\ 
Like criminals , they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer\ 
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way \ 
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay . \

You know what ? I was sitting outside just now and it was pretty < PROPFEMALE > . So I was sitting there , and I was thinking \I don't think I actually know what CAUSES wind\ " . Hmmm ... So I checked out the wiki < PROPFEMALE > for \ " wind\ " and it completely blew my mind . Yup . That was my night . Schweet !! " 
I don't care if we ARE down by two in the 2nd , Hawks are STILL gonna crush the Redwings tonight ( god told me so ) 
Wow , has anyone ever heard Hummel's Piano Concerto In A Minor Op . 85 ? It's exceedingly brilliant , especially the last movement . If you're looking for something to meditate to , this would be a wonderful choice . 
Sweet ! Just came across all the jewelery the McHenry County sherriffs dept took into custody when I was arrested last year . The rubber bands melted , but the rest was there . That makes this a very good night !

Why do I do it ? Seriously , I have no idea why I do it . At least once a year I am magnetically drawn to rotten < PROPFEMALE > com , and I'm never really happy that I did . Honestly , this ruined my whole night .

Green Tea is a miracle . That's all I'm saying . A freaking miracle . 
Wow , it's been years since I took a bath instead of a shower . Extreme relaxation , especially when accompanied by a large cup of chamomile tea . Niiiiiiice .

I jumped in the river and what did I see ? Black eyed angels swam with me ... 
Just a heads up to everyone , my phone is out of commission at the moment , so facebook is the only way to get ahole of me . Somehow , that just makes it worse ...

This life , this experience , is at all times in its entirety . A glorious\ 
manifestation . A single moment , a lone movement of a singular machine . \ 
The space between is an illusion , the handiwork of personal perspective , \ 
self sustaining and self organizing , by no means intended to represent\ 
the whole . It's just there to make it all a little easier to take in .

Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday , there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is to show support against child abuse/violence .

I hate to do it , but I'm going to have to once again shamelessly promote my photography and poetry < PROPFEMALE > , as well as ask for honest feedback . Criticism welcomed as well ( as long as it's constructive ) . \

So , apparently Obama has decided to go ahead and get the States involved in the whole Hosni Mubarak situation . Yeah . That'll turn out well . 
And today begins the evacuation of thousands of Americans from Cairo . You know that part in every scary movie where the music gets real slow and dark right before something crazy happens ... Yeah , it's kind of like that . 
Okay , so I have decided that since my backpack has been with me for so long and in so many places that I should give it a name . That torn to hell black and grey thing I take everywhere with me ?
