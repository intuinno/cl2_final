The siren sings a lonely song of all the wants and hungers . Of lust . Of love . Of brute < PROPFEMALE > . The ledge of life goes under .

Rest in peace < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > 11/85-4/10 
... just because someone cares about an issue , doesn't necessarily mean they have an informed opinion on it ...

who come begging to your house willing\ 
to exchange all their beauty and\ 
their elusive madness for the scar on your soul ... 
Just got my first digital cam . It's ridiculously hooked up , a Nikon Coolpix L110 w/ 12.1 MEGA . It was a beautiful gift , and the first digital camera I have ever owned . I'm so happy I could cry ;) 
Got a new job , starting tuesday . You know those pig-ear dog treats ? Yeah , i make those . The ladies love it ... 
Starting at the factory this afternoon . Hope all goes well . Did everyone make it back safe this weekend ? 
Happy National Pelvic Thrusting Day ( for those who participated) !!! 
PAYDAY !!!!!!!!! 
friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question\ 
their friendship . And pick up like they just spoke yesterday , \ 
regardless of how long it has been ........ REPOST if you are lucky \ 
enough to have a friend like this ! 
So I went rock climbing today . Very intense , especially for a born and bred flatlander like myself .

Back from the Great Blue Heron Festival . I stand by my guns on this one- the east coast rocks . 
Hey to all my TCTC 
Hey to all my TCTC brothers- who all is going to be at celebrate ? just trying to get a rough estimate . I'll be there along with Brownie on saturday . 
Back in Chicagoland again . Yet another funeral . Dammit . Dammit . Dammit . This record is broken . 
Fuck . Too many funerals . I think I'm out of energy . 
Thank god for family and good friends . These last two months would have been impossible without them .

If the purpose of mind is to reason , then I say it is a most honorable thing \ 
to lose ones mind . Reason prevents possability by creating comfortable \ 
facades , and splits canvases into dualistic nightmares . I wouldn't wish \ 
a right mind upon my worst enemies . 
In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape ;\ 
Broken branches trip me as I speak ... 
We'd be a walking disaster ... \ 
( just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there ) 
The ground gives in \ 
as expected\ 
and you fall into dust\ 
as before your were a child . \ 
Educate me , \ 
my brave nomadic king ;\ 
To which direction from here \ 
do you see yourself being thrown ? 
I had a dream last night that I understood how to play solitaire ... That was the whole dream . So far , it has already had a profound impact on my life . 
T-minus 7 minutes to episode 1 of \Signals From Innerspace\ " ! Whoooooooo ! Go Luc ! " 
\The earth turns\ 
In the breath of the morning\ 
I keep forgetting\ 
the smell of the warm summer air . \ 
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing . \ 
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement ... 
For the record : Damn the man , save the empire ! Good luck Brownie , you will be sorely missed . 
There is no becoming , no revolution , no struggle , no path ; already you're the monarch of your own skin -- your inviolable freedom waits to be completed only by the love of other monarchs : a politics of dream , urgent as the blueness of sky . 
Sweet gig today , doing some photography for a friends wedding ( her first one ! ) , beautiful weather , clean conscience . Life is good sometimes !

Listening to Schubert's Piano Sonata in A < PROPMALE > , and pretty sure it's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard . Just had to say . It's really THAT good , especially in the third movement . 
Just an open question : Is there anything more meditative then cooking soup ? I mean , really , is there ? 
Oh , the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear\ 
Like criminals , they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer\ 
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way \ 
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay . \

You know what ? I was sitting outside just now and it was pretty < PROPFEMALE > . So I was sitting there , and I was thinking \I don't think I actually know what CAUSES wind\ " . Hmmm ... So I checked out the wiki < PROPFEMALE > for \ " wind\ " and it completely blew my mind . Yup . That was my night . Schweet !! " 
I don't care if we ARE down by two in the 2nd , Hawks are STILL gonna crush the Redwings tonight ( god told me so ) 
Wow , has anyone ever heard Hummel's Piano Concerto In A Minor Op . 85 ? It's exceedingly brilliant , especially the last movement . If you're looking for something to meditate to , this would be a wonderful choice . 
Sweet ! Just came across all the jewelery the McHenry County sherriffs dept took into custody when I was arrested last year . The rubber bands melted , but the rest was there . That makes this a very good night !

Why do I do it ? Seriously , I have no idea why I do it . At least once a year I am magnetically drawn to rotten < PROPFEMALE > com , and I'm never really happy that I did . Honestly , this ruined my whole night .

Green Tea is a miracle . That's all I'm saying . A freaking miracle . 
Wow , it's been years since I took a bath instead of a shower . Extreme relaxation , especially when accompanied by a large cup of chamomile tea . Niiiiiiice .

I jumped in the river and what did I see ? Black eyed angels swam with me ... 
Just a heads up to everyone , my phone is out of commission at the moment , so facebook is the only way to get ahole of me . Somehow , that just makes it worse ...

This life , this experience , is at all times in its entirety . A glorious\ 
manifestation . A single moment , a lone movement of a singular machine . \ 
The space between is an illusion , the handiwork of personal perspective , \ 
self sustaining and self organizing , by no means intended to represent\ 
the whole . It's just there to make it all a little easier to take in .

Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday , there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is to show support against child abuse/violence .

I hate to do it , but I'm going to have to once again shamelessly promote my photography and poetry < PROPFEMALE > , as well as ask for honest feedback . Criticism welcomed as well ( as long as it's constructive ) . \

So , apparently Obama has decided to go ahead and get the States involved in the whole Hosni Mubarak situation . Yeah . That'll turn out well . 
And today begins the evacuation of thousands of Americans from Cairo . You know that part in every scary movie where the music gets real slow and dark right before something crazy happens ... Yeah , it's kind of like that . 
Okay , so I have decided that since my backpack has been with me for so long and in so many places that I should give it a name . That torn to hell black and grey thing I take everywhere with me ?
