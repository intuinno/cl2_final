Happy New Year ! 

Going to church for the 1st time in a long time to start working in the nursery with 2 and 3 year olds ! 
I had so much fun working in the nursey ! There was a couple girls that were attached to me the whole time ! 
I just realized how many scratches I have from 2 crazy kittens . 
I am going insane ! Zacks cat < PROPFEMALE > has learned how to open the cupboard with the garbage can and go in there and mess around . I have caught him about 4 times within 5 minutes . He will just go right back and do it . 
I am so nervous and excited ! I got a call from petsmart and have an interview tomorrow at 3 ! Wish me luck ! 
I had my interview today and the lady says she likes me very much . More then likely I have a job ! I will get a call on wednesday hopefully with a job offer . 
Still have not found anything out about the job . I will hopefully find out tomorrow . 
I got the job !!!!!!!! 
Thanks to everyone for all the comments on my new job ! I am so relieved . 
I've got wedding pictures ! Go take a look ! 
Got a call today from petsmart and am going to go to orientation wednesday . Finally get to start ! 
Having fun at petsmart ! Today i was actually able to cashier . It took a couple days to get my associate id # . The dogs that come in are so fun . Its amazing how many people bring them in ! 
Had a long day ! Went to work on my day off !! Why do people call in 2 days in a row when they are not sick ? Not the smartest thing to do ! 
2 more days of work then i've got a day off ! 
I am exhausted ! It is so hard going back to work after not working for almost 1 year . Being on your feet for 6-8 hours is not fun after not working for so long . 
Next 2 days off ! Then work 1 day and get 2 more days off ! 
Went to work and came home and went swimming with < PROPMALE > for a while . It felt so good ! I have not been swimming for so long . 
Taking care of my parents house / animals til the 9th of August ! 
Have 2 days off with < PROPMALE > ! I'm lovin it ! 
I can't believe i will be 27 in 2 days ! It is so wierd ! 
Thanks to all of you for all the birthday comments ! 
< PROPMALE > is gone for 3 days ! Going to California for his stepdads funeral . I am not used to him being gone . 
I will miss you so much Ozi ! Love you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Have fun back in Germany ! 
4 long days of work ahead of me then who knows what . Not quite 8 hour days but close enough . 
4th day of work done and 3 to go . 
Day # 7 of work will finally end at 9:30 ish tonight ! Then I have 2 days off ! 
I finally have 2 days off ! Done with this 7 day stretch of working . 
Get through today and tomorrow at work and I have 2 days off . I worked 7 days in a row the week before last and had last wednesday and thursday off and now I am working 6 days and have thursday and friday off . Been working alot ! 
Laundry day ! 
Just worked out for 45 minutes on the tredmill with < PROPMALE > . Haven't done much since before the wedding . We are gonna try to get back in shape . We will see how it goes !

Enjoying my 4 days off ! Its nice but didnt get many hours this week . Have monday thru thursday off ! 
Well , I am ending up working tomorrow but have saturday off . Someone wanted to switch shifts . 
< PROPMALE > and I have been married for 5 months today ! I can't believe it's been this long already . This year has flown by . 
I think I came down with allergies . Sneezing and watery eyes all day . The bad thing is that I have to work 10- 5:30 tomorrow . 
Worked today and got my schedule for next week and I am working 8 days straight . 1 down and 7 to go . Wish me luck ! 
Today is < PROPMALE > and I's 6 month anniversary ! 
Today is # 6 of 8 days of work . I am so exhausted already . 
Well , I survived my 8 days straight of working . Now < PROPMALE > is sick and he has to work 7 days straight . 
< PROPMALE > has been sick with the flu the last 3-4 days . Can it go on any longer ? I sure hope he gets better soon . 
I have a cough and a < PROPFEMALE > fever now . I hope it doesnt get any worse . 
Today is my first day being back to work after being sick and i'm still not 100% . I hope it won't be to bad . 
Well , < PROPMALE > left his shoes out in the bedroom . I got up and went to the bathroom and jammed my right foot into the shoe and either sprained or broke my toe . It is extremely bruised also . It hurts so much . 
Today was a really bad day at work with customers . People trying to scam us and all around I had rude customers . Hopefully it will be better tomorrow . 
Doctor appointment this morning and now laundry . What a fun day ! 
Just cleaned most of the apartment . It really needed it . Some of it wasnt the greatest looking . Believe me you wouldnt want to see ! The rest is for < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Hope everyone has a great day tomorrow ! 
Just watched Paranormal Activity and I am so freaking scared .

A couple customers came in at closing with a cat that came right up to them as they were walking in the park . No id tag or anything . Hopefully it has a chip so we can get him/her back to there owner . It was so scared and shaking and I think it has been lost for a little while cause it was kind of on the thinner side .. One of our petcare employees is taking the cat for now . I felt so bad . It is the cutest cat .

True friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people .

Off for the next 2 days ! Not looking forward to the rest of the week though . Closing Wednesday-Saturday and turn around and open Sunday . We are open from 8 am-10pm for holiday hours too which doesnt help . 
I keep hearing everyone talk about a tornado warning . Has anyone heard anything recently about it ? 
Don't work til 8 tonight and i'm scheduled til 11 and doubtful I will be there til then . Almost not even worth going in but im not that kind of person to do that . 
Got a new scratching post for the kittys on sunday and they love it ! Got some pictures up so take a look if u want ! < PROPMALE > wanted to get the biggest scratching post they had but we saved a total of 50% between the petperks and we get 30% of 1 time during christmas instead of 15% . 
We also had to get regular kennels since they know how to escape from the cardboard boxes . Those boxes have always made me a little nervous as it is . So it was time to stalk up on everything we use and take advantage of the extra little discount . I could keep going but i'll shut up now ! As you can see I had to break it up into 2 status's 
Not looking forward to the next few days at work . Working til 11 tonight and back at 8- 4:30 tomorrow . 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around you & whispered come with me . With tearful eyes , we watched and saw you pass away .

Can't believe its been ten years since I graduated highschool ! Was added to the BHS reunion group . 
So apparently there is a 13th zodiac sign which I had no idea about ! \ 
The original creators only wanted 12 Zodiac's ( 12 months ) so they got rid of the 13th one . But now astronomers are actually counting it in now . The status was to long so I put it below ! 
Kids with special needs aren't sick , or gross . They only want what everyone wants to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you are faced with it . God bless everyone who has a special need child . 
If you have a wonderful partner , who helps balance your whole world , who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you , who works hard , would do anything for you , who makes you laugh , drives you crazy , is your best friend , you want to grow old with , who you are thankful for everyday , and who you could NOT live without then post this as your status ! I love you so much < PROPMALE > Marsh ! 
My Mom has made me laugh ..... Wiped my tears ..... Hugged me tight ..... Watched me succeed ..... Seen me fall ..... Cheered me on ..... Kept me going strong ..... And ..... Drove me a little crazy at times ..... But Mom's are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever ! Put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful Mom whom you love ! I love you so much mom ! ( < PROPFEMALE > Medford )

I know everyone has been curious to why Facebook keeps coming up as my status . Somehow my email is linked to facebook even though I have disabled my email account already . Hope that clears it up and if anyone has any ideas on how to get it to stop please let me know ! Its driving me crazy ! 
Was at Big Als for a birthday party and got first place in bowling out of 4 people ! Score was only 78 but still first place ! Happy Birthday Syrus Tibbett ! Had a great time ! 
Donated my hair to locks of love ! Very wierd having 10 inches cut off considering my hair was past my belt !
