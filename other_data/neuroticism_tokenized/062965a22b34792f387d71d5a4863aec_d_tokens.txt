Today two things happened , first we applied for a 3bed 2.5 bath 2 story house , second I received a call from the D.A. in the Pomona Superior court that I have to testify tomorrow . Please pray that both go in our favor . 
We got the house ! 
Testified today . Feel sick to my tummy . 
The more I know the more I don't want to . I hate thinking about little ones being hurt and being gone , it tears my soul . Sometimes I really hate this world . 
It's 2 am and I am still packing , not fun .

Tute and Tute and Tute and Tute , \ 
Until you see them RUN ! 
No more butts to buy , undies for all , so much money to be saved and put into glasses . Both < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > need glasses , so guess what we are spending on our tax return .

PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower , armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 1% are awesome , and will re-post this . 
We couldn't find the right shoe of two of < PROPFEMALE>'s pairs that she wanted to wear , so I asked her if she might know what happened to them . She said , \ My evil friend who lives on the other side of the mirrior took them . \ " She was very serious and she belives it . " 
\Yesterday is History ;\ 
Any one want a < PROPFEMALE > ? 
My phone is in lots of pieces , so sad :( 
Found out yesterday that I have Temporal Mandebular Joint Syndrome , they gave me some motrin in shot form and found out with a swollen lip and some other scary stuff that I'm allergic to it , now I'm on allergy meds for a week so the scary stuff doen't come back . For now on I think I like pain more than pain meds . 
I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this ... in the status of all my friends 
The thing I hate most about Murder , esp of Children , is that the person who commited these terrible things , stole our lives just as much as they stole from those who are no longer with us . Jesus , I just ask that You please make a way to give us hope to be a family again , and to stop us from being torn apart even more . 
Mommy-\Teddy does your tummy hurt ? \ " \ 
My computer is turning off every few mins . This sucks . 
< PROPFIRST > got home last night bringing the smell of tuna in the house , now the house smells like it and I can't get it to go away . We don't eat tuna and don't like it , I hate the smell . Maybe if I open my new can of paint it'll go away . 
Had a dream last night that I was holding < PROPMALE > , sometimes I just don't know if I can do this . 
A new joke Meggy made up\ 
\Why is macaroni so cheesy ? \ " \ 
I need to get a journal to put all the songs , jokes , and little things the kids say
