Happy Summer everyone ! :) 
So , I'm driving home from work & some dipshit with a Mexican flag hanging off his car is doing 25 in the 50 mph zone , while cars drive by him honking their horns & flipping him off ... We get to a red light & he's driving with his iPod on in both ears & looking confused as to why everyone is telling him he's #1 ... what a freakin ' MORON ! 
Listening to Obama spew forth more crap ... BARF !

A TEACHER FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MISSOURI WILL LOSE HER JOB FOR STANDING UP FOR ALL OF US . Give this teacher and true American a standing ovation . \ 
This 4th grade teacher has said it all , and she was brave enough to attach her name to it . 
I had so much fun tonight ( Taco Night ) with my family . :) 
Ok , ok , let me make sure I have this right : left is right , right is wrong , up is down , bad is good , illegal is legal and vice versa , black is white , yes means no , and good is bad . Ok , I'm all good . Let's roll ! 
Is having my mom & dad over for a delicious South Beach inspired dinner & they picked up a Red < PROPFEMALE > ( North Beach inspired ) Costco cake for dessert ... Mmmmmm :) ~

Have to turn off the computer ... flashflood warning till 3pm & I hear thunder ! :) 
UN-APOLOGETIC AMERICAN : I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of < PROPFEMALE > and to the republic for which it stands ; one nation under god indivisible with < PROPFEMALE > and justice for all . I grew up reciting this every morning in school ; it is a shame we no longer do that for fear of offending someone . Now , let's see ... how many < PROPFEMALE > ns will re-post this and not care about offending anyone .

I have carried a baby in my belly . I have comforted a baby on my chest . I have kissed boo boos , been puked , peed & pooped on . Woke up in the middle of the night to a hungry baby & more . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body ISN'T magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror , I see a Mom , and there is no greater honor or blessing . Make this your status if you are proud to be a MOM 
I'm feeling so wiped out from driving < PROPMALE > up north to his new job . 10 hours from Victorville , CA . to Gerlach ( end of hell ) , NV . only to get there & find no vacancy's at the 1 motel . Slept for 1 1/2 hours in the car , ran < PROPMALE > on some errands for a few hours , then drove back home by myself . I felt like a freakin ' sissy , I got lost twice , but I found my way home , 10 hours later . Zzzzzzzzz 
I am thoroughly appalled that people are opposed to a Mosque by ground zero . To show our tolorance we should let them build . Then right across the street someone should put a topless bar called \you Mecca Me Hot\ " next to that a bar called \ " The Turban Cowboy\ " and next to the Mosque should be a pork rib joint called \ " Iraq O'Ribs ..? \ " Then it will be their turn to be tolerant !!!

IT'S MOMMY WEEK *** RE-POST THIS WITH THE DATE THAT YOU BECAME A MOMMY ~~~ August 4 , 1988 <3 
Can hear the thunder getting louder , turning off the computer for awhile to make some homemade chicken noodle soup & do some baking . :) I <3 FALL !! 
My home is filled with toys , has fingerprints on everything & is never quiet . My hair is usually a mess , makeup is a thing of the past , & I'm always tired , but there is always love & laughter here . In 20 years my children won't remember the house or my hair but they will remember the time we spent together & the love they felt . Your children only get one childhood , make it a good one . 
Up , showered , coffee'd , getting kids up , having a yard sale ! 
Material progress and a higher standard of living improve comfort and health but do not lead to a transformation of the mind , the only thing capable of providing lasting peace . Profound happiness , unlike fleeting pleasures , is spiritual by nature . It depends on the happiness of others , and it is based on love and tenderness . ~ Dalai Lama
