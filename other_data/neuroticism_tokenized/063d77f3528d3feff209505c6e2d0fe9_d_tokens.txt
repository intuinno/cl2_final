Do not put your faith in a cape and a hood . They will not protect you the way that they should . And take extra care with strangers , even flowers have their dangers . And though scary is exciting , nice is different than good . =] 
hates when unforseen circumstances are obstructive , because they can end up being destructive . And prevent you from being constructive . ... But I'm only saying all this to be instructive .

What I love most about rivers is you can't step in the same river twice . The water's always changing , always flowing . But people , I guess , can't live like that . We all must pay a price . To be safe , we lose our < PROPMALE > of ever knowing what's around the riverbend ...

But it's so hard to see the reality that the end will be the end of things , and our hearts are all we get to bring . So let's go ahead and make them worth something . You all laugh at me , like I'm not happy with anything , any time , anywhere . And the half of me's all about apathy . And the other half just doesn't care . =]

It amuses me how , all in one day , < PROPFEMALE > can both make delicious funnel cake from scratch AND set the microwave on fire . O.o 
Therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ... & we rejoice in the hope of the < PROPFEMALE > of God . Not only so , but we also rejoice in our sufferings b/c we know that suffering produces perseverance ; perseverance , character ; and character , hope . & hope does not disappoint us b/c God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit , whom he has given us

Close your eyes when you don't want to see . Stay at home when you don't want to go . Only speak to those who will agree . Yeah , and close your mind when you don't want to know . You have lost your innocence somehow . But everybody loves you now ... 
Things I learn from MST3K : when giant carpet monster approaches you at a whopping 2 m.p.h. , do not jump into its mouth . You will get eaten . 
I need people's opinions : Who should I dress up as tomorrow night for the HP movie ? I can't decide between Moaning < PROPFEMALE > or 5th year moody < PROPMALE > ( which I'd choose only b/c my friend < PROPFIRST > is being Umbridge & we'd have a kind of theme going ) . Your thoughts ?
