I have completely disassembled my dishwasher . Checking the hoses and listening to Rush Limbaugh . It's a good night . 
hey can somebody please go to my house and move my scores upstairs ?? I couldn't get home . flood --- chest high in the street in front of my house . 
Please pray for me and my neighbors tonight . We were evacuated from our homes due to a flood from the Harpeth River . We are living with uncertainty tonight , most of us staying with friends , and do not know what we will face tomorrow . It is supposed to rain all day tomorrow . i do not want to lose my piano but please pray for strength in case I do . it is irreplaceable . Thank you so much . 
Thank you for your prayers and kind thoughts . The rains have stopped , the water receded . No damage to the inside of the house . Many homes were not spared , one burned to the ground . It is both heartbreaking and uplifting to see my neighbors cleaning up and working together as life goes on . Power should be restored in the next few days . Praise God from whom all blessings flow . 
ice ... if any one can bring ice that'd be great . not an emergency . 
also , a member of my crew has requested more shovels and a wheelbarrow . thanks . 
Everything is fine . Backyard and garage all cleaned up , and the gravel driveway is back in the driveway instead of the back yard . Thank you to the many who came by with a shovel , wheel barrow , willing hands , and food . God bless you all . 
You mean I'm supposed to look under the house ??!! 
Alright . Time to get back to work . But I WILL get to the massage table at the help station today . And if anyone knows where I might look for my big huge trash can , I'd be much obliged if you would tell me . 
Today I'm supposed to clear out the overgrown brush from around the ac so it can air out , and this morning they put a dumpster right in front of my house ! Woohoo ! 
The nightmare is over , the head ache begins .
