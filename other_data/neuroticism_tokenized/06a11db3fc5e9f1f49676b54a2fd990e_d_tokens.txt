The Republicans are ridiculous . They're still backing O'Donnell and claiming that what she meant to say was whether the exact phrase could be found in the First Amendment . However , she did not state her question that way . This is the formality of a debate . So stop your bitching , and grow the fuck up ! What a bunch of < PROPFIRST>'s . 
The reality of politics ... \

Sunday musing - Life can be simply described as the result from a system in a high state of entropy . Thus , making life far more valuable than if it were the result of some sky daddy . 
I voted today ! 
The HTTP has several security holes and your information can be easily taken . I can easily become the middle-man and take anyone's information ( userid , password , credit card #'s , ect ) on any unsecured < PROPFEMALE > . Seeing as most < PROPFEMALE > s are unsecured , nearly everyone is at risk ! The point is , if you are going to log-in to any site on the Internet , make sure that the server is using HTTPS or SSL . 
I voted Republican because I'm a Christian , and the Republican party is God's party . I know this because he told me so . 
Playing with some new lenses I bought for my camera ...

against your position .

So today I learned that there is a Christian ( not affiliated with the WBC ) who agrees that the recent shooting in AZ was a good thing and also that abstinence-only sex education is the only way to prevent unwanted pregnancies .

My favorite question to ask evolution deniers : So the change in distribution and frequency of alleles of a population do not change with time ? The change in alleles have been observed to change over time ( evolution ) . See English Peppered Moth , single nucleotide in a < PROPFIRST > ( mutation ) , < PROPFIRST > flow ( migration ) and ( natural ) selection ( the result of mutation ) . 
Going to Alaska UAF for a couple weeks at the end of May to be a nerd and work with other climate modeling folks ... this immediately after a trip to Boston and Poland ... it's going to be a busy month
