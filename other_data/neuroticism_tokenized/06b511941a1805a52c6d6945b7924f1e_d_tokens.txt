Douggg :) iloves the hangover :) 

3 years and a day before I'm legally free to go ! 
I love how I can be ' grounded ' but still get everything I want . I guess its my talent :) 
Happy birthday to me and all those who share this wonderful day with me <3 
I like the way my lips look red . Haven't taken pics in a while . Put some up later ? Who knows :) 
I beat < PROPFIRST > up today . So that is why her eye is swollen . She alsa has marker on her neck and a stamp ! < PROPFEMALE > and I are so mean :) 
Lmao . White chicks is my favorite movie ever ! I wish I would eat like that in public . That is so unlady like . They borrowed sprinkle to make that movie :) 
School then game later if it doesn't storm :) woot ! Woot ! 
Whenever you actually have to ask a teacher something important they aren't here ! Grr . 
Yeah good job eagles ! We looked nice today !! :) 
Sometimes , you have to give things up to get what you want . So that's exactly what I'm going to do :) 
Counting the days until my spring break begins ! One week and a day !! Soccer in a few :) 
Goodnight . I'm through . Done ! Bye .
