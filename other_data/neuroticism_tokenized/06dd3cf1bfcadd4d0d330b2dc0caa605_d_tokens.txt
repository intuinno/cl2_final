People in my life make everything so much better 
It's 3 A.m. and thoughts of you are running through my mind . You're out there somewhere ... or 8 < PROPMALE > down the road ... just hurry up and find me . 
Some one should come < PROPFEMALE > out with me today . I'm bored and lonely . Two things I absolutely hate . One I even have a fear of . 
Oh love of my life . Come find me ... 
What I want right now is a nice hot bubble bath , a good romance novel , and some hot tea . 
Why do I always give myself to people who don't want me ? 
Anyone want to skype ? 
I need my sexy best friend to hurry up and get here ! She knows who she is :P 
I just made a beat by slapping allies backside 
You sir are amazing ... <3 
< PROPFEMALE > , I may be going to the battle of the bands . I need the people who are riding with me to let me know and also let me know if you have money for it . My money is tight right now and I don't think I'll be able to pay for people . 
Aha six people all fitting into a < PROPFEMALE > truck to go to the battle of the bands this Saturday . Gee this will be entertaining . 
You sir MOST definitely amazing ((: <3 
I now have a drummer !!!

So , me and < PROPFEMALE > just experienced a Muslim prayer meeting in the ingles parking lot . Best moment of our lives . She got a picture and thought they were Jews . I had my window rolled down with my body sticking out the window so I could watch them . Hahaha 
I have Internet tonight and tomorrow . Skype anyone ? 
Ugh . I hate valentines . Being alone . And sweet live songs like < PROPFEMALE > tale by < PROPFIRST > swift that makes me wish I had someone to be with . 
GO STEELERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Packers can kiss my ASS !!!!!!! sorry for my language . 
If I could I would make you love me . If I could I would forget your face . I know I could make you happy I tried so hard but I can't get away from you ... 
Should I fall for him ? If yes , what if he doesn't fall for me ? If he does then what if we fall out of love ? If we don't should I continue to wait for him ? If I do , what if he starts liking someone else and leaves me for them ? If that doesn't happen will we be together for 50 or so years and live happily ever after ? So many questions ... 
Are you gonna kiss me or not ? I really like you a lot . I think we've got a good shot . So are you gonna kiss me or not ? 
Either the ghosts in my house freaking hate me or they have an effing messed up sense of humor . I turn one tv off another one turns on . Fml . 
Daddy : I always wanted a ghost to speak to me . Want to know what I want it to say ? Me and mom : sure . Daddy : ehh < PROPFIRST > . Ehh . Then I would be like what the fuck ... ehh ? Are you a Canadian ghost now ? How do you even spell that ? Ehh . \ 
Hahahahaha 
Sometimes you have to run for a jump you know you won't make . Sometimes you have to land on your face to eventually land on your feet . Sometimes you have to fall in love with out knowing if it will work out . 
Apparently allies dog waves now 
I don't think you're ready for this jelly . 
It's time for me to move on and be with someone who makes me laugh more than you did . 
It's a popcorn explosion !!!! 
Every one should go see This Night I Possess at the masquerade march fifth !!!!! 
I wish you'd ask me out tomorrow . But I know it probably won't happen .
