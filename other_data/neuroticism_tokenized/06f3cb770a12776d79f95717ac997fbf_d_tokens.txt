All love is expansion , all selfishness is contraction . Love is therefore the only law of life . He who loves lives , he who is selfish is dying . Therefore love for love's sake , because it is law of life , just as you breathe to live . - Swami Vivekananda

I am the green in the grass that bends back from underneath your feet . And I am the blue in your back alley view where the horizon and the rooftops meet . ?

Time is to slow for those who wait , to swift for those who fear , too long for those who grieve , too short for those who rejoice , but for those who love , time is eternity . ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dyke 
I've been jumping from the tops of buildings . For the thrill of the fall . Ignoring sound advice . & any thought of consequence . My bones are shattered . My pride is shattered . And in the midst of this self-inflicted pain . I can see my beautiful rescue . <3
