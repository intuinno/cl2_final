Every thing is okay in the end . If it's not okay then it's not the end . 
Advice is what we ask fo when we already know the answer but wish we didn't . 
Never be afraid to try . Remember amateurs built the ark , professionals built the titanic 
Today was not a good day . :( 
Saw New < PROPFEMALE > last night with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !!!! It was so good :) 
There are three types of people in this world , those who make things happen , those who watch things happen , and those who wonder what happened 
The feeling when things change for the better and you figure out what really matters .... 
When you see someone you used to know but you dont really say anything ... thats awkward 
Beginings are usually scary and endings are usually sad but its everything in between that makes it all worth living . 
YAY !!!!! WINTER BREAK !!!!! :) 
I really wish I believed that . If only it were that easy

I have 18.5 hours of company rehersal over break ... so much for break oh well 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS !!!!!!!!! 
People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world , are the ones who do . 
Why do I always get there right when someone gets hurt ???? 
no matter how much u want it to be , things will never be the same ... 
some of the fan groups i dont understand . I read what the group is and i say to myself i hate it when that happens why would i become a fan of it ? but the < PROPFEMALE > has tons of fans ? what ? 
Haha most fun night ever ! < PROPFEMALE > LaPre < PROPFEMALE > Horn and I kick butt at lazer tag ! totally beat 6 air force guys at it ! woot woot we are amazingness 
Everyone says they want to be remembered , everyone says they want to make a difference , so when the time comes to make a choice , how can people say that they dont care ? 
have you ever wondered which hurts more : saying something and wishing you had not or saying nothing and wishing you had ? 
I'm amazed at how you get everything you want ...... 
A stranger stabs you in the front , a friend stabs you in the back , a boyfriend stabs you in the heart , but best friends only poke eachother with straws :) 
I wish I could tell you I understand , that I know how you feel but the truth is I dont know , and I don't think I will ever understand exactly how you feel . All I can do now is try to understand , to make it okay ... 
Dance , the only place where you can say \dang I forgot my pants\ " without it sounding weird . " 
This weekend was so fun !!!!!!! I dont want to go to school tomorrow 
Saw the new < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland movie !!

I am going to be sore tomorrow 
Happy Easter !!! 
I was looking at old pictures and its crazy how different things are and how things have changed so much . It makes me miss those old times , makes me wish I could just replay them over and over , and it makes makes me want to stay friends with you always ! :) 
We stopped looking for monsters under our beds when we realized they were hiding in the people around us ... 
You can close your eyes to things you don't want to see , but you can't close your heart to the things you don't want to feel . 
Giving up doesn't always mean you are weak sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go 
and yeah ... i guess thats it . 
As long as we have memories , the past remains . As long as we have dreams the future awaits ! 
Vague-booking : the act of posting a very vague status on facebook so people will wonder/ask whats wrong . Admit it we have all done this haha . 
It seems like when you are all the way back in September the the year will just go on and on forever , but when you finally get to May and school is almost out you wonder where the year went . 
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... NINJA !!! hahaha oh good times :) < PROPFEMALE > LaPre < PROPFEMALE > Kramm < PROPFIRST > Lind < PROPFEMALE > Brogan < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > 
\What am I suposed to do when the best part of me was always you 
Nothing you have that much passion for is ever a waste of time , no matter how badly it ends or how well it goes ... 
You are so fake . 
http://www.formspring.me/racheljackson ASK ME SOMETHING !! 
Do all things really happen for a reason ? 
Loves Coldplay 
Went to look at houses in Breckenridge ! So excited !! 
What's the biggest mistake that you have ever made ... that you don't regret ? 
Is pretty annoyed :( 
A friend is the person that knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you forget the lyrics . 
The song California Gurls has been stuck in my head for like three days . 
Little kids are so cute . 
So last night I found out what corners are for , divices invented to find furniture in the dark ... ouch 
I really hate the word sorry . 
Got the house !!!!!! SO Excited ! 
At the end of the day the people that really matter are going to be the ones standing beside you watching the sunset and assuring you that it will rise again in the morning . 
I would like to dedicate this to that random lady , < PROPFEMALE>'s dad , and < PROPFEMALE>'s gradfather ... yyyeeeaaahhh ... < PROPFEMALE > Horn 
Quality night , Amazing cake that WASN'T a fail !! :) < PROPFEMALE > McCall < PROPFEMALE > Vastine

you can close your eyes to things you don't want to see , but you can't close your heart to things you don't want to feel 
I'm getting my hair cut tomorrow and I want a new style ! any suggestions ? I'm thinking about front bangs . 
sometimes its just not worth the fight

Why do I always get my hopes up ? 
It takes an athlete to dance but an artist to be a dancer . 
If you think you know then your probably wrong

Well you're not awake , but you haven't been sleeping and you hate god , but you don't believe in him and your not scared , but you still have your eyes closed ... 
Just to clear up any confusion DECA stands for Deaf Emus Carrying Alpacas . < PROPFEMALE > Horn 
http://www.formspring.me/racheljackson ask me stuff !!! 
because well behaved people rarely make history . 
And life's like an hour glass glued to the table 
The scars will just remind us of how far we have come . Don't let where you come from define where you end up . :) 
Happy thanksgiving everyone !! :)

No 40 year old foreign man you may not be my friend on facebook !

Its funny how you go through the year day by day but nothing changes , then when you look back everything is different 
Everybody dies , but not everybody lives
