There is neither happiness nor misery in the world ; there is only the\ 
comparison of one state to another , nothing more . He who has felt the \ 
deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness . We must have\ 
felt what it is to die , that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life . \

\The secret of happiness is to make others believe they are the cause of it . \ " \

Where ever you go , there you are . 
Unless you are 1 of 2 people , having an opinion on the way my marriage works is a bit pointless . I see you as I would a window shopper . You can not describe important textures , colors , or smells . You can not describe how anything feels in your hand or on your skin . ( continued ) 
I hate it when you finally fall asleep and your cell phone rings ; I hate it even more when its not YOUR phone ringing !
