I've heard a lot about the French side of my mother's tree , but the English side is interesting too . Since < PROPMALE > of 1628 was born in Ipswich and married in Newbury Massachusetts in 1651 , he sailed across sometime between 1628 and 1651 . < PROPMALE > , his dad , shows up in the passenger lists from 1635 , so little < PROPFIRST > probably hitched a ride with his folks in 1935 , which is when Newbury was founded . 
<-- 1620 Mayflower . I'll give this a rest soon , but while 3/4 of my mother's family are French Canadian , the English quarter is currently fascinating me -- it appears that my great(x10 ) grandfather < PROPFIRST > Turner came over on the Mayflower in 1620 , although he died during that first year . 
Quick onset , high fever and shivering , feeling like a bus hit me . flu
