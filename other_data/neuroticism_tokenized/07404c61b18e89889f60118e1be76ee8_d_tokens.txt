Is wandering how food in < PROPMALE > is better than in other countries( U.S. and Russia ) . I eat veg . sald at 8am , and only at 4pm I eat chicken salad , and nothing else : I'm full . NO meat !!! and NO soda !!!! But it's o.k. Mother Russia is waiting for me : blinchiki , kartoshechka , shashlichok(pincake with sour creamk , fried potato and shish kebab ) and Soda with sugar ...

some reality show is being shot next to my door : all the parking spots are blocked because of this ... I don't like reality shows !!! 
Just received email at work with “Privacy and Security on Social Networking Sites” with nine items how to protect yourself from thief’s and avoid viruses – it sound like wash your hands , use condom and don’t forget to lock a door . This virtual life becomes too much realistic 
Had to change my Gmail login name , to my original name , because people got confused thinking that my name was “seruvv” , fifteen years ago when we created these weird and funny alter-ego names nobody cared , and it was cool ; now people don’t even think that it might be not a real name , there is even such a thing as electronic signature , never thought it may exist . Bottom-line : I’m becoming a dinosaur in computer world 
I don't have mornings 
Today at Dunkin Donuts saw a women whose hand and shoulder was completely covered in tattoos , and she asked for “coffee with skim milk and no sugar” , which looks to me like a heroin addicted is asking for kosher food . \
