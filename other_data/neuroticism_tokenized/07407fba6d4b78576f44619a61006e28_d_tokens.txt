The facebook trick : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , b , a , enter key then right click . Then press up then down & magic circles will appear ! The only way to stop it is to log off or reload the < PROPFEMALE > ... put this as your status if it worked for you . So Cool ! 
can't get any Lady Gaga song out of his head . He's been singing them ALL . DAY . )= but he likes it =) 
I thought a Prius couldn't get any uglier .... then I saw one in camo O.o

THIS ... IS ... CHRIST-MAS !!!!!!!!!!!! >=O

2010 will forever be known for terrible movies and overrated singers . 
Launching flaming pumpkins from a trebuchet . WIN . 
I'm going to take the time to say that for the majority , this'll be the last semester we have together . I'm gonna miss a lot of you guys , even some of the underclassmen . We're almost out , so let's just have some fun . Senior Class of Double 1 ! 
fml . My guitar hero guitar has finally died . At least it lived a long and happy life . Now I need a new guitar . 
SCHOOOOOOOOOOOL'S OUT FOR SNOW DAY ! ~ 
But I don't want to go to school tomorrow D: 
My cousin < PROPFIRST > Sullivan has just been arrested for the accused murder of two people at his home on Fairview Rd . o.o 
has thought of a reason why all of you should go to Dessert Theatre : you'll get to see him dressed as a girl , which should provide plenty of comedy throughout the night =3 
is no longer going to be < PROPFEMALE > . Instead , he is the comic relief , Malvolio ! 
http://www.supload.com/listen?s=ttOup8 you know you like my musics D:< 
is going through his Paramore playlist . Current song : Hello , Hello ~ 
is wanting to book some sort of gig at the Underground 
is listening to The Witch and the Saint .... THANKS < PROPMALE > >=O jk , I love it . Really . 
got his hair cut for dessert theatre earlier ... and doesn't like it at all >=O 
is worried about Dessert Theatre ... no practice today or tomorrow . Hopefully , we'll all know our lines and just get there extra early and do blocking . 
is it bad that I WANT to go to school tomorrow ? : < 
is glaring at the snow . Maybe I'll gain heat vision and we can go to school :D 
is . so . bored . D: 
is practicing his piano version of Bad Romance . 
scratch that , learning Bringing Me to Life <3 
Literacy Test = biggest joke invented by man :D 
EVERYONE . CHANGE YOUR LANGUAGE TO ENGLISH(PIRATE ) 
apparently you DO learn at least one thing every day . And what I learned is : I was playing Bad Romance the wrong way :3 
just drank a funk shake and feels like he can take on the world ... more or less :3 
officially can't use his < PROPFEMALE > without it hurting worse than listening to < PROPFEMALE > O'Donnell sing D: 
please , enlighten me so I don't forget . Rehearsal starts at 3:30 today , yes ? 
Like this if you too mourn the loss of use for my < PROPFEMALE > ;___; 
is freezing D: 
is . so . bored . >=O 
is , as Emmey often says and for lack of a better phrase , bored as sin . 
it's only 16 days ' til < PROPFEMALE > Hero ... I think I'mma dust off my script :) 
is ... at a loss of what to put here :/ 
just woke up from a nap and had the most terrible dream that Leopold's theme song was Party in the USA ): 
let's see ... it's a Saturday Night , I have nothing planned , what should I do ? S.L.E.E.P (:

rather liked being a big , pink , just-had-lipo dragon today :) 
va aller à demain répétition dans son joker costume 
is watching Count of < PROPMALE > Cristo :) 
feels like he is about to throw up and has no reason why ): 
Shorts + flip-flops + having to throw yourself around on carpet because it's what the script says = scratched/skin ripped off of your feet , knees , and legs . ):< 
is killing time ' til 5 by sitting at a stop sign and having staring contests with drivers/passengers :) 
just got out of the shower , and is going to go grab some Taco < PROPFEMALE > from Harding before heading over to school for the play . 
thinks Actor's Showcase went pretty well :) 
state tournament was .... way too tiring -__- 
to the person in the silver car who honked at me around 7:45 pm , who are you ? 
just had FroYo for the first time .... and loves it like no other <3 
caved in and downloaded a bunch of Ke$ha songs ... specifically Dancing With Tears In My Eyes . Thanks Emmey[/sarcasm ] 
is listening to the always-good Evanescence :) 
thinks that him , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > are going to have TOO MUCH fun at 3:05 tomorrow >=) 
FROYO !!!!! <3 
misses the seniors :'( 
doesn't remember ... when is the Alg II EOC ? :|

dislikes this great amount of boredom :( 
oh look : coconut halves ! < PROPMALE > Python and the Holy Grail emulation : begin :)

V -v-v- VICE . President . * makes memo to randomly appear in Miami Vice attire on last day of school this year/first day of school in August * :3 
is excited about getting to go to Scotland summer ' 11 :) 
\This is madness . \ " \"..........\" \"?\" \ " This . Is . SPAR ! TA ! \ " * kick * " 
what to do ... :| SO . BORED . 
My < PROPFEMALE > Silly Band broke :( 
mmmm ... Orange Sherbet from FroYo <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
Drama test tomorrow , French the day after , and Environmental Science on Friday . Being absent a lot sucks . 
STOP ! End of testing for the day . :) 
FroYo is exceptionally good today <3333 
NOW LEAVING OCCUPIED < PROPFEMALE > . Au revoir , Madame Slaughter ~ 
Fro to the Yo ~ <3 
a 24 on the ACT ? Needs improvement . Not bad for my first time .... I guess :| 
< PROPMALE > of Persia was awesome . FroYo was awesome . ' Twas a good night , if I might say so . 
sleepy ... must wake up .... need ........ Sunny D ........ 
bored , bored , bored , I am so bored ~ 
Re-cap of my summer thus far : sleep , sleep , watch < PROPMALE > of Persia , sleep , watch Karate Kid , sleep , post this on facebook :) 
1:30 am and I'm too bored to sleep -___- 
Two years of French = I can say hello ; one session of Finding Nemo = I can speak whale :) 
Just woke up . I guess that makes .... thirteen hours of sleep ? I need more . I still can't function . 
wishes there was something to do .... 
is there no limit to my boredome ? I'm literally eating just because I have nothing else to do . Oh , how low I have stooped . 
just got a new puppy :) 
26 minutes until CIA vs KGB on Deadliest Warrior >=) 
FroYo :) ' nuff said :) 
oh , hey there , boredom ! what are you doing back here so soon ? 
there is a puppy trying to eat my foot , and he is succeeding . :( 
there is a drama carwash next saturday ... but wait ! that's my birthday . I think I know what's more important :) 
the answer to life is < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s voice . 
is attempting to film himself playing guitar hero without looking . Apparently , you can win tons of money just by being good and going to competitions . Even more if you don't look ... which apparently none of the YouTube world can do aside from me , and that's a pretty big world . 
mmmmm . FroYo . I'm so glad you brought the orange sherbet flavor back :) 
is going to attempt to start filming it .... AGAIN . Here's hoping for the best . 
If anyone happens to have a camera and some free time on their hands , would they like to come film and be witness to something never seen on youtube ? :) 
Panic ! at the Disco .... I forgot I liked you :) 
is sitting back , relaxing and watching Charmed . 
\What is at a peak is certain to decline . He who shows his hand will surely be defeated . He who can prevail in battle by taking advantage of his enemy's doubts is invincible . \ " - Cao Cao . " 
I wonder if there is a reason that my Old Fashioned Hard < PROPFEMALE > Root Beer Barrels are fat-free ... 
Chelcie is my ex-french < PROPMALE > . She has a nice accent . I miss her . 
Senior Year on less than half a piece of paper : 1)English IV-Rand ; 2)Stage Prod I-Taylor ; 3)Chem H-Bennett ; 4)Alg III-Birdsong ; Lunch :) ; 5)Oral Comm-Choate , StudyHall B-Harper ; 6)PE-Leonard , Psychology-Treadway ; 7)Drama IV-Taylor 
20 days until Senior Year can kick off with official style . Can't wait . 
is actually excited for school this year , but is also experiencing some twinges of sadness .... 
It's called a Doogle and I love it . 
is more or less at 95-97% of notes hit on Misery Business , on expert , without looking . There only 3 vids on youtube of people playing on expert blindfolded , but they're doing ridiculously easy songs . I think I'll have to step up my game and do something like Everlong by Foo Fighters , which is remarkably harder than Miz Biz . 
just watched YTNN and the numerous LR Drama Tournament vids on youtube . Memories , man . Memories . and muffins . 
still can't believe it's not butter ! 
what's that ? a zombie ? never fear , I have a shotgun ! (perfect example of why southerners will ALWAYS survive a zombie invasion ) 
good morning facebook . wait , no , it's not a good morning . this is too early to be up . I want summer back so I can sleep in . 
Day 1 of Senior Year : check :) 
I think Coach < PROPMALE > is right . Gym WILL be more fun when we can use the new gym instead of the girls ' gym . Psychology , welcome to 1st semester . 
Drama Priority Checklist : make sure that the Haunted Shop has been OK'd . 
LionFest was cool , just , not temp-wise . AT ALL . 
thinks that everyone should go to Autozone from 9-3 tomorrow and get their vehicles washed :) 
Oral Comm Project : Yes , I'd like some pictures of you for the collage . Me : We're sorry , but the item(s ) in question for cannot be found . They do not exist in our databanks . 
thank you to everyone whose vehicle got washed . we really appreciate it . by we , I mean the people going to Scotland(this does not include myself , sadly ) 
despite wearing very strong sunscreen yesterday to the carwash , I am sunburned and look like < PROPMALE > . Please sing that particular Christmas song everytime you see me at school . I'd think you odd not to . 
is done with his Oral Comm collage :) 
Pharoah Ramma-Lamma-Ding-Dong does not enjoy the three-day weekend to be at its end :( 
yay ! my english essay is done ! :) 
Madi , I don't like wroting .... 
still has no idea what his temporary mummy outfit for the fair parade is . :/ 
Like this if you saw a mummy today :) 
has a severe case up updawg 
oh , just to make this clear on the off < PROPMALE > someone thinks this : my facebook note I wrote about love is NOT directed at anyone or inspired by any events . Just saying . 
is maybe 60% done with his oral comm project 
make that 100% done :) 
saw Bish and < PROPFIRST > at < PROPMALE>'s :) I'd mention < PROPMALE > , but he hasn't graduated , so I do not miss him severely . 
11:00 AM , Friday , October 15th , I believe you need to hurry up and get here . 
11:00 AM , so close , yet so far away :( 
Research Paper checklist : Rough Draft [] , Final Draft [] . And I only have today . Perhaps Mrs. Rand'll let me work on ' em a bit next week .... 
thinks something may be wrong with his neck . I woke up a few hours ago and it was a bit stiff , but now it's just a < PROPMALE > pain to barely turn it any which-way . :( 
Hey . Everyone . Go to the auditorium a5 2:00 and watch the play :) 
the play is finally done with ! 
has the feeling that something is rotten . In the state of Denmark . :) 
Polonius and < PROPMALE > FTW . Just saying . 
I think tomorrow night I'm gonna try a social experiment ... >:) 
facebook , my question for you is : what are you doing for Halloween ? 
only a few hours left until I begin the long process of Joker-fication . 
just got told he is going to get a haircut soon . I cannot stand for this . Winter is approaching , and with hats being frowned upon at school , I have no better way of keeping my head warm . 
Hey . Four day weekend . Get here already . 
we're climbin ' in yo ' classrooms , snatchin ' yo ' teachas up , gonna hide ' em so you gonna fail the class , fail the class , fail the class ... 
\Twilight : a tale of a girl's choice between necrophilia and beastiality . \"" 
is watching Count of < PROPMALE > Cristo , which outclasses -nearly- every movie released in the past two years . 
Enjoy this year's halloween . ( new profile pic ... finally ) 
so ... apparently , high school students just loooooove them some SIMPLE magic tricks . I can only imagine what would happen if I did harder ones . 
well , this utterly sucks . This is the week of Dinner Theatre , and in English , we're reading the M-word . HELP . ME . 
walked around school for a bit , levitating a card , like a BAMF . 
Hey . You with the $8 . Come to Dinner Theatre tomorrow at 6 PM . You will not regret it , I swear . 
I woke up with a guitar hero guitar in my hands . This is either a sign , or someone must have slipped me some drugs last night :/ 
Subliminal Message time : Go watch Dinner Theatre tonight . Doors open at 6 , food is served at 6:30 , show starts at 7 . Go , and watch . 
dinner theatre was a success ! and now , to take a cold shower so as to cool off from the combination of many layers of thick clothing and ridiculously hot stage lights . 
yay ! International Thespian status ! 
is about to watch Deathly Hallows . -IF- it is good , I will then proceed to wonder what divine intervention happened to the director < PROPFIRST > Yates , and why it couldn't have happened earlier(I'm looking at YOU , Half-Blood < PROPMALE > >=O ) 
As long as beauty is in the eye of the beholder , there will be many faces with black eyes . Let us return the favor to those who dare to force their ridiculous standards upon us . 
has a Joker monologue for Drama Tourney(albeit some additions and whatnot :) ) ! 
Put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was killed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when it was under siege by Death Eaters in The Second Wizarding War . Over 50 citizens died in this terrorist attack . 93% of people won't repost this , but ... will you be part of that magical 7% that will ? Repost to show your support of Dumbledore's Army . 
I find it funny that this person who is a year and a half older than me , at least half a foot taller than me ... is my nephew XD 
I think I might have actually gained some weight from this >> 
is practicing his solo piece for Saturday . 
is going to Phoenix for xmas 
... I can't even come up with something witty to put here . Perhaps I'm sick . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . His voice . Imagine that coming out of my mouth . It is . 
got a haircut . My head is cold . FML . 
I have until rougly 8AM to get at least a decent version of the Joker's laugh . I'm in for a rough night . 
to all in Bugsy Malone at tournament , break a leg ! 
getting ready to head to the bus that then heads to tournament . I hate being up this early , but I can smell a first-place trophy or two >:) 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , he's climbin ' in yo ' farmhouse , snatchin ' yo ' poultry up , tryn ' a take ' em , so ya'll need to hide yo ' chicks , hide yo ' eggs , and hide yo ' roosters , ' cuz he takin ' all of ' em out of there . 
can't stop listening to Panic ! at the Disco . This is easily a good thing . 
and they danced like no two people had danced before , with a passion so fierce it could be felt and seen . The marvelous vision of the two was but a facade , created to make the others think they were in love . But love , as it was , no longer existed anywhere ... 
Jokes about \The Raven\ " :\ 
I am craving bacon . There is no bacon here . This could be a problem . 
just ( hopefully ) killed a spider by spraying it with TAG . I say hopefully , because it disappeared on a white floor . Like , turned invisible . I was watching it the whole time , and it didn't go into a hole or under something . It just vanished . But it's ( hopefully ) dead :D 
\Like\ " this if you're not taking semester tests . " 
My drama > your drama . But that's probably because while you're dealing with petty people , I'm hanging out with the cool ones . Acting drama > people drama , which equals My drama > your drama :) 
Drama X-mas party was fun and whatnot . Now it's time to chillax and do nothing . 
watching Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus . 
just got told by < PROPMALE > and Paco that Coach Birdsong says I have to take my semester test . According to my calculations , I have a C for a semester average in that class , and only have two absences . I SHOULD NOT have to take it . W.T.F. 
I don't have to take the test . Coach Birdsong just forgot to < PROPFIRST > me absent . w00t ! 
\The Pessimist complains about the wind . The Optimist expects it to change . The Realist adjusts the sails . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > " 
nothing like a little FroYo to make the day better :) 
He that knows not the nature of man is best-suited to live among them . He who knows is he who chooses to isolate himself from the calamity to come . 
can't wait for the lunar eclipse :) 
22\ TV > 42\ " HDTV . That is all . " 
I can't help it that I feel that today and tomorrow will just be \another day \"." 
just another day .... I could sure use some Christmas Spirit . Unfortunately , the only holiday I recognize is Halloween >> 
I never thought this would happen again . A headache caused by boredom , who would've thought ? 
... I just sneezed 17 times in a row , which is the 37th occassion of me sneezing today . Methinks I might be allergic to Christmas :| 
still hasn't seen even a speck of snow . 
Indiana Jones marathon :) 
for Christmas , my present was the ability to win the game >:D 
new phone is in need of < PROPFIRST > . You know how this works . 858-7398 
when you're wearing black slacks with accentuating off-white pinstripes , whoa , everything goes according to plan . 
it is safe to say that I can do a perfect Vader impression . May or may not upload it later ;) 
this is probably wrong of me , but I am thoroughly enjoying my mom kicking my stepdad out . 
the power to kill is not an abomination . the choice to do it is . 
Any dolt with half a brain could tell that humankind has gone insane , to the point where I don't know if I'll upset the status quo if I throw poison in the water-main . Listen close to everybody's heart , hear that breaking sound . Hopes and dreams are shattering apart , and crashing to the ground . 
is sitting here , bored and singing along with Dr. Horrible . Text it 5018587398 . 
watching DECODED . Pretty interesting stuff . 
Tomorrow . He returns . Mufasa . 
its 2:36 in the morning , school starts at 8 , and I can't sleep . How typical . fml . 
didn't sleep at all . This is going to be a terrible day . 
even though my doctor said I shouldn't eat for 48 hours , I did anyway . And I've gotta say , those were the best spaghettios I've ever had . 
Hey . Don't snow . I kinda need to practice Bugsy Malone with everyone so I can catch up . Kthxbai . 
there is a 1/0 < PROPMALE > of it snowing :) 
here are my thoughts : Searcy is barely getting a millimeter , while everyone else is getting lots . Harding -essentially- controls Searcy , and since the students come back tomorrow , if it snows , there will be no students , which will mean no money . Harding likes its money . Harding therefore set the weather to \Torment by letting everyone else get snow . \"" 
I tripped and hit my jaw on a chair earlier , and I think my tooth might be loose . This could be a < PROPMALE > problem . 
um , no I don't want to be a Gemini . I'm a Cancer . Kthxbai . 
next weekend : Drama Tournament . Weekend after that : Thespian festival . What a great way to end January . :) 
the only thing keeping Monday from being Monday is Bugsy practice . 
I feel as if there is a Chem test tomorrow , but I don't know if there is , and if there is , what it's over . :/ 
I think I have drain bamage . 
Thespian Festival . Hurry up and get here . 
drama tournament is postponed until Feb . This makes me incredibly angry . 
... IN < PROPFEMALE > . 
anyone know if we have school tomorrow ? 
I'd say something witty about how playing in the snow has exhausted me and I want to go to sleep , but everything does that . Insert witty comment here , and good night . 
only two and half days of school this coming week . Thespian Festival , how I love you <3 
Me , I'm dishonest . And a dishonest person you can always trust to be dishonest . Honestly , it's the honest ones you need to look out for , because you never know when they'll do something incredibly stupid . 
it honestly doesn't feel like Saturday to me . 
is carayizy . 
there's a hole in the world like a great black pit , and the vermin of the world inhabit it , and its morals aren't worth what a pig could spit , and it goes by the name of London . 
well , the good news is , I know how I'm going to do my makeup for Commercial . Bad news , I lack makeup and have no way of getting some :/ 
is a blood sprinkler :) 
it only took 4-5 aerial workshops , but I was transformed into a beast with four-pack abs . Yeah . Believe it . 
watching Case 39 
is a circus freak :) 
The Only Difference Between Martydom and Suicide is Press Coverage 
I could kill for some bacon right about now .... 
Drama Meeting tomorrow ! And I will be severely angry if there are no donuts . 
The human heart is the source of all our power . We fight with the power of our hearts . 
Life is more than experience that is put to use , more than just an accumulation of memories . Living just to die is just too sad . We call it life because we feel it , and only so long as we have a reason for living does death become what it truly is : another step . 
That of which cannot be sought provides the basis for the search ; and yet the despair felt through the futility is as naught but an ant under the boot of man . So why do we keep looking for the thing we cannot have ? Lest we fall victim to the fear , we cling to the infinitesimal , yet still in existence , speck of humanity that we call \hope . \"" 
Jesse-1 , Snow-0 . I'm whiter , take that . 
Papa < PROPFIRST>'s <3 
I'm out of school all week with the legit flu . No Dessert Theatre for me ... crap . 
I need to lose the flu in two days . 
Tamiflu , you just might be my saving grace :) 
how on Earth is Searcy the ONLY district in Arkansas that is GOING to school tomorrow ? If by some miracle we're out , they'll probably make the announcement WHILE people are getting ready , like the jerks that they are . 
all this snow , and I'm too sick to go out and enjoy it . 
just saw two guys running down the street having an epic lightsaber fight . 
I would like to thank tamiflu for nearly curing me of the flu . Antibiotic for throat infection ... do your job right . 
coughing up a lung shouldn't be so literal ... 
Throat infection , I was fine with you up until now , but not letting me do my Joker Impression ? Prepare . To . DIE . 
why , yes , I was putting up an act . What else do you expect from an actor ? 
Y'know who < PROPFIRST > Bieber is starting to take after ? < PROPFIRST > McCartney . Very similar . Except , y'know , there were actually reasons to like McCartney . 
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger . 
two of my friends die and my girlfriend leaves me for a Floridian grandmother . This will be a good play . 
not looking forward to tomorrow ... 
I think someone should tell my mom that she's supposed to SING on a karaoke machine , not laugh . 
need a new impression to work on since Sweeney is practically nailed . Any suggestions ? 
Plan A and Plan B have failed . Plan C ... don't continue the trend . 
Sit tight , I'm gonna need you to keep time , come on , just snap , snap , snap your fingers for me . Good , good , now we're making some progress . Come on , just tap , tap , tap your toes to the beat . 
State Drama Tournament , or Prom ? 
Haven't you heard that I'm the new cancer ? I've never looked better , and you can't stand it . 
is learning Sweeney < PROPMALE > songs :D 
Hello , March ! 
How they make a man sing ! Proof of heaven as you're living - pretty women , sir ! 
is writing a script for a sing-along similar to Dr. Horrible , but with less superpowers and more prom-ness . 
is the groupie that got groupies . 
does anyone know why I'm not on Whitest Kids U Know ? 
is reading Timaeus in hopes of finding the goodness for a monologue for tournament . 
both the experiences and the signs say that nothing has been , nor will ever , go right for my Senior year . 
\Like\ " this status if you are female and free for prom :) " 
I have become < PROPMALE > Weasley . That is literally how red my hair is . 
Finishing Timaeus and then starting Critias . Oh , Plato :P 
this looks like a promising day :) 
I've had a twitter since mid-July , and this is the first time I've accessed it since . Glad to know that Facebook is better :) 
I can feel it starting again . The celebrity deaths . There must be 2 more , as there always is . 
I'd like to take a moment to remember the life of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . May you rest in peace . 
Dream Job : Grapist . 
No , it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality . 
can play a 4 chord song ! 
tomorrow I will do nothing but play 4 chord songs . 
don't you just hate it when your dream is more realistic than reality ? 
Happiness is like glass ; you may not always be able to see it , but it's definitely there . You just have to change your viewpoint slightly . 
is practicing Timaeus for drama tournament next weekend . 
seriously , is EVERYONE on my friends list having a terrible day or something ? 
20 . Days . I think this feeling was best summed up by McLovin : \Chicka chicka yeah ! \""

such lovely storms :D 
I have succeeded in cutting down a tree using nothing but a herring . 
Day 4/20 . 
words can't even describe how ridiculous this is .... 
watching Sweeney < PROPMALE > . Win .
