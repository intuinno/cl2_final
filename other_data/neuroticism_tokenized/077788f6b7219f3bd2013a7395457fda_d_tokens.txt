Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , let's cut down congressmen's pay , too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep this going if you agree .
