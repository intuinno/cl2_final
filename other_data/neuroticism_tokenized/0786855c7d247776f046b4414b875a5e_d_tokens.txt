To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , knives stab people , and spoons make people fat .

Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised .
