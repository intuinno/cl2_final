DearMr . President I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to savemuch more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree .
