Finish each day and be done with it . You have done what you could ; some blunders and absurdities have crept in ; forget them as soon as you can . Tomorrow is a new day ; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense . ~ Ralph < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE >

God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ; courage to change the things I can ; and wisdom to know the difference . 
“Don't rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth . Only you can be responsible for that . If you can't love and respect yourself - no one else will be able to make that happen . Accept who you are - completely ; the good and the bad - and make changes as YOU see fit - not because you think someone else wants you to be different . ”\
