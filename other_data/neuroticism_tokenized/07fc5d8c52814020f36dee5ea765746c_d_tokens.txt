I’m 21 now but age gives no guarantee on maturity . ;) 

I'm thinking I have made my decision . < PROPFEMALE > is more expensive and doesn't sound as exciting as South Korea's summer program . So , South Korea it is unless a problem comes up with my eligibility . Let's see if I can get this application started ! :) 
Memo to self : Don't yell your lab partners name unless you're 100% sure of his name . I knew it was one of the brothers from Home Improvement , and I knew it wasn't < PROPFIRST > . I yelled Brad .... it was < PROPFIRST > . Go figure with a 50/50 < PROPMALE > I pick the wrong one :D 
How is it that I am passing my physics lab and not my class ? Answer : My teacher puts way too many questions on the test to answer in 45 minutes and 90% of the questions he never gave an equation for so it takes forever to figure out an equation that * might * be right . Thank God I'm drinking tonight . 
Woo ! Great news out of nowhere !! :) 
Why am I always the one with flat tires ? Forget being a vet , I should just open up my own tire shop so I can fix them all myself ! But I wouldn't want to put Dob out of business by him not having the < PROPMALE > to fix my tires :D 
Not one , but TWO nails were found in my tire . When my car wants fixed , it damn well takes it to the limit to make sure I fix it in a timely manner .
