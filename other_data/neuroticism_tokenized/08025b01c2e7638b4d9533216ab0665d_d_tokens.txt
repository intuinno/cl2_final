if your child is under 11 years old they should not see Where the Wild Things Are . Not because it would scare them , but because they won't understand . 
spent 3 hours picking up trash around Silver Lake . Perfect weather . 
there's something beautiful about waking up on a Sunday and admiring God's beautiful creation . While watching < PROPFEMALE > prance around because it's cold . There are perks to having a cold .

is planning on going to the Ren Faire with a friend , who wants to go with us !? 
surprisingly enjoyed part of the 4 hour long Hamlet ... Anyone else want to go to the Ren Faire . We decided on Saturday . 
Why do people jokingly tell you to behave when it clearly isn't funny ? Seriously , how do you respond to something like that ? So far I give a polite smile and laugh , then I walk away . 
had THE BEST time at the Ren Faire ! 
Oy vey . 
' s psychology teacher told me that they shot off guns at LSCC for veterans day . She , however , forgot and thought that someone was shooting people . Sadly , it WOULD happen in Lake County . 
when God speaks , its best to not say anything and just listen to what He says . He did give us two ears and one mouth so we can listen twice as much as we talk . 
Good Boys Sink Down Hard . aka . The rugs go in front of the Garage , Bathroom , Sink , Door , and Hallway .

Is it safe to say that I highly dispise the month of December ? Not because of Christmas , but because of people . 
Big head ache ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s kisses and moving hips sends me on a one way trip ! 
Woohoo ! Psychology is finally over ! Now on to finish my literature ! 
THE SNURKS !!!!!! I haven't seen this movie in forever !!!!!!!! 
I really dispise < PROPFIRST > Fielding at this moment for writing such a horrible novel that I have to read . 
According to my brother if < PROPMALE > Wenger jumped off a < PROPMALE > then everyone would follow him . I think we found something that we both agree on . :) Good seeing you today , < PROPMALE > ! 
One more final and I will be done ! Lets just hope I can wake up before 8 . 
Woohoo ! Finals are over ! I am going back to bed now . 
She waited till just before midnight , so no one would see her go in and crying she knelt by the manger for her gift was unworthy of him . Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness , \Maria what brings you to Me ? If the bird in the cage is your offering open the door let Me see . \"" 
is sick . 
Oh how great is the Lord of the universe that he would look down on me and help with schoolwork ! Thank you again , God , for my straight A's .

I bet that your pastors don't teach this at Christmas time < PROPMALE > 10:2 -4 . 
I <3 my brother . Good times , and good pictures . 
Why should we always stay where we began ? Why should the church be a spiritual school composed of first-graders who never go beyond the first grade ? Nobody wants to get any further than this , and I do not mind saying that I am somewhat sick about it all . It seems to be an awful , mixed-up concept of Christianity . - A . W . Tozer 
probably shoudn't have stayed up so late with my dad . 
has a new number 352-561-8564 or 352-561-vlog . =] Of course if you call me now you will only be able to leave a voice message so give me a couple of seconds to set it up to my home phone and laptop . 
School today , but I don't have to go until 2 in the afternoon ! 
had a horrible dream that we had to put < PROPFEMALE > asleep . 
the cat is afraid to go outside . I would be too . 
You know you have weird dreams when you dream that your cat has a boyfriend . I don't think he's right for her . 
I love googlevoice ! Makes me smile ! 
Yesterday : I think I'm going to start eating healthy . Today : I want a doughnut . 
Sometimes I want to hug you until you pop . Other times , I just want you to pop . haha !

I lost the game . 
1 . I have a Spanish test tomorrow . 2 . I love Pirate facebook . 
Is tired of people who say they are Christians , but don't act like it . I don't know who they think they're fooling because even atheists can tell the difference between a genuine Christian and a \church-goer \"." 
HAS to watch the State of the Union address tonight .... should be interesting . 
Have you ever had one of those moments when you study for a test and during the test you forget how to do something that you've always known how to do ? Happened to me today . Apparently , I wasn't the only one . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Carmichael and our emoticon battles . 
Burry Time !

The cake is a lie . 
Some girls want doctors or lawyers . But I wouldn't trade my computer programmer for either one . Especially on days like these . Thanks again , Sweetheart ! 
Praise God for today ! An 100 on my statistics test , a $500 dollar check from LSCC , and an A on a test that I thought I got an F . Thank you so much God ! 
:'( 
After finishing my paper yesterday , my mom called & said that she locked the keys in the car & was starting to walk home . My dad & bro were gone so I called my grandma to go find my mom . When my grandma couldn't find my mom I resorted to the best possible reason , someone had kidnapped my mom . Mom finally made it back home with the experience of the LC bus transportation . 
Oh praise the One who paid my debt , And raised this life up from the dead ! 
Long day . Gave Dinky catnip , studied statistics , and wrote notes for a person in my sociology class . I think I'm going to finish it all by watching lifeburry . 
One more test tomorrow and then I'm starting off Spring Break by playing Halo with < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Vick , < PROPFIRST > Collins , and < PROPMALE > Jergens 
Can anyone else get into their gmail ? 
Well , I wake up in the morning and the ' larm gives out a warning and I don't think I'll ever make it on time . By the time I grab my books , and I give myself a look , I'm at the corner , just in time to see the bus fly by . It's alright , ' cos I'm Saved by the < PROPFEMALE > . 
is going sky diving today and picking up < PROPFIRST > . 
Well , the wind would not allow us to go sky diving yesterday so < PROPMALE > and I scheduled it for next Saturday . :( But at least < PROPFIRST > is home ! 
I'm not a twilight fan , but the guy who helped me in the learning center seriously looked like < PROPFIRST > Cullen . 
God , thank you for the little things . Like not having to do a presentation tonight . 
Attempting skydiving again today . If the weather doesn't permit , I'm going to take it as a sign from God not to go skydiving . 
Clouds give me congestion . But other than that skydiving was amazing ! 
I loathe being sick . 
Our < PROPMALE > Stover loving , cookie monster eating , bread-bandit snatching dog just ate half a bag of dum dums and pixie sticks . He'll probably have a sugar crash at 2am .

woke up at 4:50 am yesterday . Got to LSCC at 8 to complete a take home test that wasn't due that day . And was owned by two 12 year olds on halo . I hope today is a better day .

It's scary when you delete your Facebook and then decide to get back on only to discover that Facebook has kept ALL of your information . 
Facebook Survivor ? Let's do it ! 
La di da de dum , la di da de dum what's the name of that song ? 
Eastern standard time . Always ahead never behind . 
At UCF with my brother .

Is it wrong that I got excited because I found Hello < PROPFEMALE > silly bands ? 
There's a party in my tummy ! 
Oh , < PROPFIRST > Choi . Your music is so amazing that it's soothing . 
When < PROPFIRST > Smith scolds you , it's like Canada ( the friendliest country in the world ) hating < PROPFEMALE > . 
I remember when A-ok was the cool thing to say . 
Me : Hey < PROPFIRST > ! Wouldn't it be cool if we saw Aunt < PROPFIRST > on 44 ? 30 minutes later a car pulls out in front of us . Hey look ! Its Aunt < PROPFIRST > ! 
I love having conversations with < PROPFIRST > on facebook when we're practically in the same room . 
Headed to the rubber duckie race ! 
... Then they killed off the word ' no ' . They just killed it . They killed it ! It was a sad day for the alphabet . 
Pray for those in Japan ! 
A couple of nights ago I accidentally pulled my cats tail because I thought she was my pillow pet . Oops . lol 
I have a challenge for all of my friends . For the next week , I'm giving you the privilege to write my about me for me . Whatever you comment on this status will go on my about me . You can write a sentence or a paragraph , or even better continue from the last person's post . ( This is a Grace Collins original , don't let me down . ) 
You know that feeling when you think you're finally going to finish a video game just to find out 2 hours later that the story doesn't end yet ? I've hit that point . 
Hello piano ... It's been awhile . 
It's a big buff Neanderthal riding a narwhal . 
Playing outside with kids for 3 hours is a great way to stay in shape . Plus its just fun ! 
I'm a blueberry , grape , and more importantly a strawburry !!!! 
God will provide enough for your needs , but not enough for your greed . 
Before you criticize someone , you should walk a mile in their shoes . That way , when you criticize them , you’re a mile away and you have their shoes . 
Women are hypocritical . We say that we want a guy to love us for our personality but judge guys by their looks . 
< PROPFIRST>'s text from 10 steps away : She seemed unhappy that we are early , we should run . 
On rainy days such as these my dog and cat like to sleep in my room as we wait for my mom to finish her music lessons . It's getting a little cramped in here . 
Have you ever noticed how Facebook is like prison ? You sit around wasting time & writing on walls while being poked by people you haven't met ... 
I heard someone call out in the mall cafeteria , \Two diabetes ! Your order is up . \"" 
I love that when my aunt's dogs are in the garage , they bark at everyone who they can't see except me . Its like they can feel my presence like a jedi . Lol 
One day without shoes is today ! 
I'm on edge today because its national weed day . Everytime I smell something , I ask < PROPFIRST > if he smells it too . 
Best family conversation ! Mom-\I think we're related to Fergie . \ " < PROPFIRST > & Stephanie -\" The singer !? \ " Lol happy Easter everyone ! God is good ! " 
Just made a banana < PROPFEMALE > mask to put on my face . Cons : The chunks of banana slide down your face . Pros : You can feed the rest to your dog . 
Laughbook , crybook . Put all your business out there then wonder whybook . Truthbook , liebook , indirect subliminal replybook , lovebook , hatebook . Quick to give advice but dont pull your own weightbook , realbook , stuntbook . Why people gotta frontbook ? This is done only on FACEBOOK . 
I think its funny that people judge others on how spiritual they are . As if they have a say so in the matter . 
I was woken up by < PROPFEMALE > this morning it went a little like this : \Oh herro < PROPFEMALE > ! Did you know I can get up on your bed now ? Cause I certainly didn't . \""
