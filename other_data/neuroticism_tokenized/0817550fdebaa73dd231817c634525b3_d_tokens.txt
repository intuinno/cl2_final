Maybe people will be more receptive and less intolerant of things that differ from the typical societal norm this year :) 

I hate relationships >:( we all must use our own critical thinking skills to evaluate viewpoints , facts , and behaviors objectively to assess the presentation fo information or methods or argumentation to esablish the true worth or merit of an act or course of conduct . People , are a disease , a virus that destroys all which it comes into contact with for self gain . 
Facebook is really boring :(

I decided to put the worst pictures of me on here . Why ? Why not ? Who really cares anyway I mean really . These pictures of me in my white tank top where with no shower for two days , sleeping in my makeup and just freakin nasty :) 
Peoples secrets . It's amazing the types of secrets people keep . It changes your perception of them . People that were loyal , trustworthy and decent people become nothing short of lying thieves or criminals . 
Washington State ..... If I didnt know better , we could find Satan Ruling from Seattle . 
The end to another crappy day in Washington State . 
I need to take a picture of myself , I just got out of bed . Been laying there for a few hours and my hair looks like I put my finger in an electric outlet . 
It's amazing how people that are supposed to be your friends turn on you in a moments notice . 
New apartment , awsome roommate , things are better finally 
Finals , HOW EXCITING :) 
Washington State University here I come :) 
Decisions decisions .... 
The nice thing about having a new roommate is not having little crack dogs pee on my shoes . If you're going to have animals , TRAIN THEM and be a responsible human being with them .
