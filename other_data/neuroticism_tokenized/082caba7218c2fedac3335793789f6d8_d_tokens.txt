\Making up my mind is just so unfulfilling/ what is there to find in the thoughts that i think/ maybe i should try some sleep/ or some weed/ or some narcotics but then id regret it probably/ so i'd rather make the right decision . . . \""

Did they tell you , you should grow up\ 
When you wanted to dream\ 
Did they warn you , better shape up\ 
If you want to succeed\ 
I don't know about you , who are they talking to ? \ 
They're not talking to me\ 
I'm higher than high , lower than deep\ 
I'm doing it wrong , singing along <3 -Metric

Like tragedies of irony we all look the part , but the comedy of sensibility we've all had to start praying before we sleep , looking before we leap . I want to live my own life . And just be .. Me <3
