If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world . Who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you . Who works hard and would do anything for you . Who makes you laugh and drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who you want to grow old with , who you are thankful for everyday , and who you could not live without . Brag about him a little and re-post this as your status ? ??
