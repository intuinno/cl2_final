I listened to the new Eminem today . I wasn't sure what to expect since the last album was painfully bad . It wasn't just his worst album it was just plain awful . His new album is amazing . The beats aren't quite as good but his lyrics are awesome . I'd say they are the best they have ever been . Everything is right in the world

I heard a rumor that the \made in USA\ " stickers are made in < PROPFEMALE > . If this is true perhaps there is a market for new \ " made in USA\ " stickers with a near-infinite number of progressively smaller \ " Made in USA\ " stickers . And of course I would make the last one in < PROPFEMALE > to preserve at least a little bit of irony . " 
I am now running Android 2.3 on my hero O.o
