One last night , one last time to spend with you , if only you were here 
Church+Wapsie = Party all night long :) 
We use the word love so casually today what do you feel when I say I love you ; what do you think I mean by it , because when I say it I really mean it and I'll say it again I love you ... 
when you become an equal to your idol who do you look up to then ?

Wake up at the crack of < PROPFEMALE > slip down stairs and sit beneath the fire , pull out a worn copy of \The Republic\ " ..... then promptly fall asleep " 
Life is such a simple fleeting thing and in considering mortalitiy it arouses in me the question of what to do when confroted with such a dire prospect ? 
When does the cold realm of logic cross into the hot passionate realm of love ? 
Love is never letting go even when you know its gone never giving in even when you've lost and most of all being there for her 
I'm a believer not a taste of doubt in my mind i'm in love 
I have s many visions for the future and the only thing i regret is not being able to share them all with you 
If there's nobody beside you then ill follow you into the dark 
Pastafatarian ;s its not quite christianty but it has the irrestiable charm of FOOD and some pretty tasty meatballs . 
If I told you how much you meant to me my only fear would be that you didn't feel the same way if I keep quiet I can pretend it will be all right 
As one < PROPFEMALE > of hope blooms with the start of a new journey so must a journey come to and end and all that was attached withers away 
Waking up is never easy its more .... intresting when you have someone standing over you 
People are flowers budding into beautiful unique blooms you have to look at each one differently to appreciate them

Is it worse that someone died or that I don't feel anything about it ? 
I'd rather be hated for who I am then hated for who I'm not . Actually I'd rather be loved .

I shout out but nobody hears and as I trail off i remember nobody cares , I lay down and am quiet 
I'm at debate camp how is there this much drama ? Whatever just talk it out don't go and be pissy if we try to help sometime people care 
I refuse to be a realist , I will dream and I will hope for a better- The Romantic , -a dying breed but does it have to be so ? 
If this be but a dream , should yet one waking moment break the yonder spell . One burst of sight through the stumbling darkness and one sees what one has missed . 
Love , in its final moments and last breath will take its final embrace sweeping us into the dark 
Apologetics , My sword of truth smote your life of lies , oops im sorry

When i was young and knew everything and she a punk who rarely ever took advice now im guilt stricken sobbing with my head on the floor stoppin baby's breath and a shoe full of rice no . Cant be held responsible she was touching her face i wont be held responsible she fell in love in the first place For the life of me i can not remember what made us think we were wise 
Those better pastures are just over yonder , keep rolling and you'll make it one day my son . I promise we'll make something out of the green , green field just over yonder 
There comes a point where one is so generally down but not sad your not sure whether to lay down and cry or just move on its not crushing but its just a general :(

I'm pathetic today , get up and stand for what you believe or i'd rather be a filthy hypocrite . now its just :( 
Smile its what the people want doesnt matter how you feel torn up inside begging for someone to reach out paint that plastic grin , or other generic crap 
We sit in our Kumbya circle and talk about our feelings , the realist comes and kills the dreamers and takes everything leaving nothing but bones behind consuming the idea of a better world . Turn your back get stabbed ,

A jagged bolt of lightning rips through the sky as your words did to my heart , searing a trail of fire that burned and crisped , leaving me bitter and lost .

So I'm now doing this number thing as well , message me a number i'll write a status about you 
13 : Your really special don't ever forget that , I really do care for you and wish only the best for you in everything you do . Even if you debate LD , somethings can be overlooked . I still look back at Iowa City and remember are walks fondly and hope you feel the same , MISS YOU TONS ! 
123 : Haha your one of the nicest people i know , I'm always marvled at how well you float between groups and never letting anyone tie you down from what you want to be , don't ever lose that . I wish we still were closer cause you helped me out a ton and I never really got the < PROPMALE > to return the favor . 
3131 : Still think of you every time I pass a McDonalds , and Yes I have ordered ( or tried ) A Mc______ even if you now do PF debate we still love you . Send my regards to all the rest of the Iowa kids you see around . And oh btw your a really nice guy , keep it up 
19 : What's there to really say , \If Music be the food of love play on\ " - 1.1 12th Night and your in band ... But I can honestly say I'm so glad I met you and I think of you daily " 
42 : Your one of my best friends I don't know what I'd do without you . Thanks for everything you do . You always make my day just a little brighter and better 
792 : I'll freely admit I didn't always care for you , but to do so would be stupid . Your a genuine sweet caring person . Thats all too rare today , Don't ever lose that and I'm impressed on just how nice you are to people even thouse outside your cliche or group way to go ! 
15 : Well I bet that kid you met one day in the middle of summer would never come to be such a good friend . I'm glad I didn't take that bet . I don't know what I'd do without you , I feel like I can always talk to you and know to expect your sarcastic wit and thanks for being such a good friend 
593 : Your way to religious the end\ 
nah but your a nice kid thats fun to talk to , you know at least most of your stuff and Im fairly impressed with all of it , though perhaps you should check cause deathmetal =/ the bible 
26 : Dewgong ! \ 
and in that one word I feel like it says everything worth saying . Your super involved with everything , a policy debater , funny and witty , oh and liberal . + your a dewgong i mean what more can one wish for than an asian manatee ? 
I'm playing only Beatles music till i get through every song in chronological order , And yes they are all good 
Emmy : You seriously need to log out of your facebook ! Every time I try to get on , it's on yours ! \ 
< PROPMALE > : Whatever ! It's an accident , it hardly happens . \ 
Emmy : Suuure . Just please stop it's really annoying having to log out of yours every day . \ 
< PROPMALE > : It won't happen again . Jeez , chill .... \ 
\ 
Well then < PROPMALE > . How is this for ' it won't happen again' ? Hmmm ..... 
Dear _________ , \ 
You already know who I am and you know plenty about me . But when it gets down to me do you really know me ? Or just know about me ? Can you tell me what makes me laugh and smile and what I just downright hate ? Do you understand me or can you just pretend too ? Do you even want to try to ? I wouldn't blame you at all if you didn't\ 
Sincerely , \ 
< PROPMALE >

The world is a cruel unjust place , no matter what the justification there is no reason to shoot a innocent nine year old child in the cold blood . Ever . My thoughts go out to < PROPFEMALE>'s family and friends and maybe jut maybe we can prevent this from ever happening again . 
Discourse is the words we speak . Ideas are formed in terms of the words we speak . Ideas we have become the way we think . How we think affects what we do . What we do affects what others do . What others do affect a society . A society affects the words we speak . Break out of a cycle of destructive discourse before I lose any trace of faith I have in you < PROPFEMALE > 
I guess I'm doing this again ... \ 
message me a # I'll make a status about you or something like that 
21 : your super nice , and pretty cute to , I never see you anymore though\

17 : Wish I saw you more often ( seems like im saying this alot ) but yah your really sweet and Im sad that I never get to see you anymore 
9192010 : you put the date we met ? cute . I can say I still feel the same now as I did then can't wait to get a < PROPMALE > to see you again . 
17 : I do not think It would kill you to admit I was right once , for one thing , rather than making me win everything in a debate . Still its fun 
5382238- Sometimes I still think of you and wonder what I missed out on . Every now and then I still miss you
