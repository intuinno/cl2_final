It's going to be alright . It was just a little fight . For freedom , for justice , the act of making a name . We are all lost , we are all confused . We are all teenagers looking for a place , looking for a show , a place to hide and a place to glow . DOn't give up , Keep your head held high . There is always tomorrow , there is always a new day . And I will never make you walk it alone <3 
Sprained ankle I curse you !!!!! Not now ... 
Keep your heads up girls . It's not over yet not even close . Don't let them see you weak . Don't ever let them see you cry . Keep your mind , your heart strong . If they beat us mentally then they have us beat for all . Don't think we can't do this cuz we can . Never ever say sorry or that you let me down . No matter what happens you will always be my girls and I love you to death ! Thanks for being so amazing <3 
I don't want to hurt you . I don't want to dissappoint you . I'm lost and very much confused . I'm trying to find my way in this world ... this new reality and it harder than expected . Life isn't suppose to be easy but no one said it be this hard . I'm fighting everyday to just get thru the night . Im slowly fading and im breaking inside . Now I know what goodbye feels like 
haha my Halloween costume is amazing lol and totally unique .... totally me haha . Can't wait to get it :p 
I miss the innocent days I had when i was young . But life got hard and its hard to adapt . I have new ways , I have new days . The days are gone when you were by my side , you took away my fear and picked me up off my feet . I miss the days but I forget the days . The young , the innocent days . All I wanna be is carefree ... nobody else but me ? -SMH 
We have come so far so let's give them a show . We have worked to hard to just let go . Don't ever underestimate me for me . I may come back and sting you like a < PROPFEMALE > . I may not know my rights from my wrong . But I am tough and I am strong <3 -SMH ...... Don't give up girls ! It not over . Don't give up on me now we can do this !! But I need you all to be in it with me ! 
Good Job Football and Volleyball !..... Gah I hate being sick . Seems to happen to me every year around State . All I have to say is better this week then next week . Can't believe it almost that time of year . Everything going by so fast . Before I know it I going to be throwing up my grad hat and rushing out of the high school towards my dream , a new reality , and the real world . Crazy huh ? Love ya all <3 
Ok so tell me how I suppose to do my last online assignment if I can't access it ??? hmmmmm .... I have asked and done about all that I can lol ... now just have to wait it out and hopefully it all works out before due date on Tuesday hahah GAHHHH !... Think my Halloween costume came it WOOO !!! Can't wait for this weekend . It time to give it up and just live it up :) <3 Love The Life We Live and Live The Life We Love <3 
I hate being sick ! :( ... It needs to go away right about NOW !.. Ughhh haha I just feel totally drained physically and emotionally right now . But on the bright side I got my online class up and going ! Phew ... Can't wait for this weekend . Having a feeling it goint to be pretty great <3 
A month !!!!??? Wowww .... huh ?... This can't be happening . I feel as if my heart is losing its beat more and more each day . Right when things start going good . Finally I found my place , the arms I belong in and it has to end . U.S.M.C take care of him for me please :( I can't lose him . <3 
I wanna know all the answers but I'm learning these things take time .... I wanna understand why but these things take time ... If we ever fell in love would the wind go would the pain go away ?? I was afraid to try but afraid to never know what it feels like to be loved . I guess I will never know . I need to go run and clear my head . Gotta focus on the bigger picture now .. <3 
Dang phone why aren't you working ?? I curse you lol . So ya everybody Heads up my phone went retardo and I can send but can't recieve texts . So if ya have been texting me and I haven't replied I promise Im not ignoring you ! lol . Called Verizon and I have to update it which I can't do cuz I live in the middle of nowhere but hopefully should be fixed by Friday . If you need to get ahold of me just call : ) Thanks <3 
Can't believe in 5 days I will be stepping up to the line and running my last high school Cross Country race : ? Can't believe how fast time is going by . I am going to miss my girls so much ! But I know they going to be just fine . When my phone gets fixed I going to laugh when all the texts start coming thru . I can only imagine how many there is goin to be haha . * Never Underestimate The Dream ... Lets do it girls ! <3 * 
Excited , Nervous , Ready , Butterflying , Focused ( Mentally and Physically ) for this weekend !... Take the pressure , take the pain and put it all together and make a name . Never underestimate yourself girls ! We can do this ... Just have fun . THanks for the amazing season . I love you all and I going to miss you ! But I know you going to be just fine : ) Class of 2011 BABY !!! Wow this week went by fast <3 
Leave for State tomorrow . So pumped and ready . But it really starting to hit me that this is the end of my high school cross country career : ( But even more reason to go out big right ? I can come back as good or I can come back with the gold ! Ready to spend the weekend with my girls for one of the last times : ( Love You Girls ! Let's do this ! Love You all so so much . Thanks for making my senior year a blast : ) <3 
This is it .... This is the end of my High School Cross Country Career . No time to hold back . Time to take a risk , a < PROPMALE > and prove the doubters wrong . No time to look back and say \what if\ " but time to be able to look back on the course after my race tomorrow and know my heart was put out . Time to make some fame and make a name . Come on PanTigs Let's Give This Town A Name !!! <3 " 
Not how I ever imagined my last Cross Country race ever ending . Although it is hard to find God's reasoning for me collapsing with a mile left in my last race with an injury is hard to imagine . However , God has reasons for everything . But he gave me the strength to get back up and cross the finish line . There was reasoning .. I changed a life and didn't even notice till I crossed that finish line . He opened my eyes <3 
Boot and Crutches ... oh joy oh joy . Now I really am a hobalong . And to all the people in the world ... going up and downstairs on crutches is not as easy as it is made out to be lol ... Good foot goes to heaven . Bad foot goes to hell .. lol hmmm good analogy but I still can't do it haha . <3 
I don't know what we are . I don't know what we will be . All I know is my mind is nothing but you and me . You make me ramble when I'm shy . You make me laugh when I cry . I am a klutz and you love every imperfection . You have my head spinning with everlasting affection . I don't know what we are . I don't know what ... we will be . Hopefully one day we can be something greater than just you and me ? 
Glow Stick Dance Tonight ! haha I can't wait ! < PROPFEMALE > and I are going to pimp out my crutches and boot with glow sticks haha :p ... Have a feeling that this could be a great start to an amazing weekend : ) Excited to be able to go watch my bro run in his XC race . And guess what everyone ? No Math homework from our \thug\ " teacher haha ! Life Is Good <3 " 
Dance was pretty dang amazing last night ! : ) ... And my crutches looked flippin sweet lol . Although , I lost count how many people tripped over them ... haha my bad :/ ... Well headed of to Gillette here in a bit : ) Kinda excited . Just saw my bro a week ago but already miss that little sucka ( and of course my sis too ! ) Life Is Good <3 
Running has always been a big part of my life . However , I never knew exactly how much I loved it and needed it in my life till it was taken away from me . Went to watch my bro at his XC meet and he tore it up !! Just sucks seeing all those people running just makes it more real that my high school career is done and there nothing I can do about it ... Pullin an allnighter for my college course . Wish me luck <3 
Oh brother oh brother what shall I do with you ! A simple \What do you want for your birthday ? \ " and you reply NOTHING !!. Your a poor college ... take that back your a < PROPMALE > little puppy but geez come on ... Guess I will just have to pick out your present with no input from you * sigh * Men are so complicated lol ... Love ya <3 " 
What do I do when all I think about is you . I ask questions that may never be answered . One day , one hope , one prayer . Two hearts can be greater than one . I can live with thinking . I can live with hope and wonder ; but what am I suppose to do when I fall in love with you ? <3 
I miss you ... that is why I send a billion texts , make the call . I wanna hear your voice and know your going crazy too . I guess I just have to wait for you to miss me now <3 
I see you walk down the hall , but you don't say a word at all . What can I say , what can I do to save your broken soul . You need a hand , you need a friend , but I not going to be here till the end . So look at me , say a word . Help me help you . Let's save this broken soul <3 
Ready to just walk with my boot tomorrow . My armpits are sooooo sore from my crutches ! Pretty excited bout multiple things : ) My mind going off in so many directions at this point haha . Hope I get to go visit Concordia soon : ) ... Thank goodness tomorrow is the last day of school for the week I ready for the weekend and just to relax . Really want to go swimming or biking ... thing that is my plan for tomorrow : ) <3 
I'm lost and confused . I have been twisted and used . I loved how you could tell I wasn't ok , but I hate how you believed my lie . Maybe this is a game , maybe an eye for an eye . But answer this .... What am I suppose to do when all I know is that I am falling for you ? <3 
Rode my bike around Kerbs loop today : ) Feels good to be able to do some activity !! : ) Have to say it was a bumpy ride though ! But must say nothing beats running ... Can't wait to get this boot off . The weather has been amazing and all I want to do is run . So weather just give me a few more weeks please and thank you ! haha <3 
Everyone something happened to my Facebook and a message was sent to all of you ... DO NOT CLICK ON IT !! lol it is SPAM !! bad stuff people no clicky 
I use to hope for you and I . Now I sit here wondering why . I need to realize we weren't meant to be , you just didn't feel same about you and me . I sit here wondering what to do , because for some reason my heart is still stuck on you . Maybe there no reason or maybe I like the taste of pain . Until I figure this all out I will fight through the storm and dance through the rain <3 
Sometimes You Have To Kiss A Lot Of Frogs Before You Find The < PROPMALE > <3 No one said life was easy , but it is up to us whether we just deal with it or do something to change it -DMW ...... Hmmmm ... I'm a pretty happy chickadee right now ; ] 
Ugh ... sometimes I just ugh !!! haha ... Just frustrated and overwhelmed . Just wish I could see him . <3 
Ugh !!! Where to start ??? Im frustrated , Im overwhelmed , I'm GOING CRAZY !!! lol .... Just wish all this work would just go away but I know it not going to : / I really don't like senior year ... its been one of the hardest years of my life ! I thought it was suppose to be easy ... You liars !!! lol ... Everything would just be so much better if I could just see him <3 
It's the things you say , It's the things you do . They all got me going crazy over you <3 
Ok peoples we are taken a vote : ) Should I grow my hair out again like freshman year ?? Or should I keep it the length it is ? Vote Vote Vote <3 
No one can do it like you do . No one can make me smile , and laugh like you do . We are < PROPMALE > away and hours apart but baby you have a piece of my heart <3 : ) Pretty chipper girl today ... Not looking forward to the five day week though : ( sighhhhhhhhhSIIIIIIIGGGGHHH lol ... But I am excited just little longer till get to see my familia : ) 
Just ordered my amazing running shoes : ) ... Ga I can't wait to get them and put them on BOTH feet and go for a run again ... I miss running so much ! Hopefully get my boot off Thursday though !! Crossing my fingers ! Then the times of everyone asking \why do you just have one random shoe everywhere\ " shall end ! haha Today has been long but really not a bad day ; ) <3 "

CAN'T Wait !!! Just hope I survive till then lol . And keeping my fingers crossed for Thursday , PLEASE NO MORE BOOT ! 
The smiles you put upon my face , the butterflies you leave stomach when I hear your voice . You pick me up when I am down . I am sometimes weak but you make me strong ; For you , for me , for us . I wanna be by your side ; that I cannot hide : ) You have allowed me to try . You have allowed me to believe . I know this is not a dream although sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure <3 
Doctors appointment tomorrow morning please no more boot ! That would make my week even more amazing :) woke up in quite a good mood n hasn't gone away ... Man he got me going crazy ;) hahah <3 
Got my boot off today ! Still can't run for two more weeks though :( ugh this is killing me !... Really don't want to go to school tomorrow sigh ... oh well can't wait for next week only thing tat would make it tat much better is if I could see him :) < 3 
Sigh : ( back to the boot for a week or so ... just to sore to walk around on a lot ... Can't wait just two days of school ! Then off to spend Thanksgiving with all my amazing family ! Excited to see all the little ones they all getting so big its crazy !... Think I need to hit the weight room so I don't get wrestled down by all the boys again haha : p Missing Him <3 
It's going to be alright . It was just a little fight . For freedom , for justice , the act of making a name . We are all lost , we are all confused . We are all teenagers looking for a place , looking for a show , a place to hide a place to grow . Keep your head held high don't let them bring you down . Your not going to go through this alone . Not today , not tomorrow , when I said forever I meant together . <3 
Drunken Off Nothing But Each Other Till The Sunrise <3 Love Ke$ha's new album !! Way better than the first ... KUDOS !!!! Haha I'm sure < PROPFIRST > and I will be jammin and know all the lyrics to all the songs by school tomorrow haha .. School is pointless this week we not doing much . Hope I make it to Guernsey tomorrow ! He is amazing ... but yet that doesn't even seem to cover it <3 
Made it to my grandparents last night : ) Just waiting now for my cousins and sis to get here ... This has already started out as an amazing Thanksgiving with my family . Serenity is so cute and has gotten so big since I last saw her !! Hope everyone has a great holiday with their families : ) <3 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone : ) !! Hope its great ... I know what mine is going to consist of ... eating and sleeping because ya see boys are very persistant , They will not allow girls to beat them in any sort of challenge or game ... sigh Boys will be boys and while they are being well them ... I going to sleep like a baby ! Minus all the crying I gonna be out ! lol ... So thank you thank you very much haha <3 
You can only eat so much until your body realizes how completley full it is and explodes haha ... lol ehhhhh don't like upchucking hahahaha ... not exactly the best feeling in the world haha ... I think I done with food for my life ... or at least for another hour hahah : p Having a great time with all my family . Especially Erin ... and < PROPFEMALE > ; ) wink wink haha Love Ya All <3 
Had a great day yesterday : ) And excited for today with the girls : ) Oh and muhahahah the taste of revenge is sweet lol . Told you I would beat you at this game sometime and I did : ) doing little dance woot woot haha <3 
Only time will tell our < PROPFEMALE > . Only faith can strengthen me . I wanna be strong . I wanna prove the doubts wrong . So stay by my side . Take my hand . Don't let go . Let's give them a show . Because only time will tell our < PROPFEMALE > and only faith can strengthen you and me <3 -SMH 
Sometimes life needs risks , second < PROPMALE > s , hello's and goodbye's . One never realizes how fast time really does fly by . I took a risk , I gave my heart a second < PROPMALE > . I said goodbye to my past and said hello to something that will last . So don't give up don't give in . The ice can't stay forever thin . Take a < PROPMALE > take a risk because sometimes the greatest things are closer than you think . <3 
I don't have the latest fashion . I don't have the latest technology . I don't have the perfect life but I take and live what is right in front of me . If you have something to say please say it to my face . I can take your words , remarks , put downs , rumors because I am me . And because I believe in me and stand strong for me then let me apologize for the things you don't like but I ain't changing <3 
Awwww ... I miss being little and watching the Rugrats all day : ) ... The young , the sweet , the innocent days : ) ... Guess sometimes good times never fade . But life is all about growing up .. mentally , physically , emotionally . Time disappears before your eyes so don't waste it . Make the best of the worst , and < PROPFEMALE > all the great like you will never have it again . <3 
Call it an ordinary day but its not . Even the coolest girls around aren't all hot . It's the past , its the future , it's the present . Just give it up , Live it up . Don't hold back , don't give in ... your lying if you say you have never sinned . Just forget it all because the people that really care are going to be there to pick you up when you fall . <3 
I won't let go because I can't go a day without you ... or even an hour . No one said anything would be easy in this life . Yet no one thought it would be this hard . Then I met you and you said that life is going to be life but its up to us whether we change it . Well I wanna change it ... and that is what I'm doing with you <3 
:( everytime !!!!!!! Sorry hon .... Idk how but I am goin to try everything I can to make this up to you . Sorry for the dissappointment . You mean so much to me 
Dream Big , Go Big . Never Underestimate Yourself <3 
Can't wait to see my sister ! : ) seems like it has been so long . Ready for shopping , and chick flicks ( Zac Efron ) :p and late night talking ...... So guess this means I get the floor when you come home ? Since the other bed was bednapped haha ... Love my family and friends . Yep people sometimes life can just be that good ; ) <3 
All I wanna do is be close to you . All I wish is to hold your hand . Sometimes things just happen without a plan . All I want is for something that will last , something to allow me to let go of the past . Im crazy for you ... and I never going to be able to get over you <3 
People say I so lucky to be in a little school where there is not finals .. Well why then am I being bombarded by every test possible ... * sigh * 1 down-100% ... 2 to go .. crossing my fingers ... Today was like cookin day ... cookies , truffles ,, and MORE COOKIES !! lol . Can't wait to see my sis this weekend ! and himm : ) very soon <3 Yep life is juuust that good : )

I bite my lip and you know why . Maybe its because you make me laugh when I want to cry . You have no reasoning for the things you do . But you respect me for who I am and what I do . Your everything I dreamed of and now its true . Now I know everything I ever wanted was just to be with you <3 
Had a great Christmas . However , I still believe I got the best gift I could ever ask for about two months ago : ) .... What do I have to do to see you ? It's killing me . I'm sorry . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas Everyone ! <3 
Why < PROPMALE>' t you want me happy . Why < PROPMALE>'t you love my smile . Do you really want to make me cry to you really wanna hurt me this way . I do love you but we need adjustments . Because without noticing you really are taking away one of the best things that has ever happened to me . Im happy again , so < PROPMALE>'t make it go away again . <3 
Don't give in . Don't give up hope . I promise one day we are going to get out of this sinking boat . You mean so much to me and I know you feel the same . We are going to change this ok ? Please smile . Please don't frown , for if you do this boat may really drown <3 Im Sorry 
You make me smile . You make me laugh . You catch me when I fall . I don't know what I would do if it weren't for you . Hope to see him soon !! <3 
Had an amazing day yesterday . Never wanted to leave ! : ) : ) What can I say people .... I think I'm truly fallin <3 These butterflies are never going to go away . Life sometimes can really be this good : ) You jus have to fight through the storm and dance in the rain .. every pain we have ever experienced will go away and a new day will come .

Not giddy type smitten\ 
Not clingy type smitten\ 
Not like a middle school girl who claims she is in love\

Happy that maybe love does exist\ 
Happy that all the past breaks and tears will slowly start fading away . \

It's time to forget . It's time to forgive . Live it up or give it up . This is our life . Live it through love . Dream big .. Go big .. Because you never know what's around the corner <3 
Like this and I'll tell you : Do I regret meeting you ? Are you important to me ? : Have you ever made me smile ? Have you ever made me mad ?... Best feature ? Do I like your profile picture ? Do I see you in my future ? Do I love you ? Have I ever crushed on you ? You're my : Rate on a scale of 1-10 : Do I dare you to put this as your status ? : 
When you hold me close and grab my hand and say your never letting go . That is the moment I feel needed for the first time ..... 
Everything I was looking forward to jus totally crashed .... Idk what to do anymore . This is not how it was suppose to be 
I just came to say hello ..... Hello ! Your alright but I'm here darling to enjoy the party ! I just came today hello ! ......, Gahlove this song deff my jam for the summer ! Now I wanna dance :p

Live is a crazy thing . It's something tat is explained in tears , kisses , the heartbreaks and the hugs . Love is powerful ... It has the power to stay and live within or the power to leave one standing in the rain not knowing which step to take next <3 
What do you want me to say to you ... that \ I can't get my mind off you\ " .... Because of everything we have been through ... everything we were gonna do . I guess we just didn't think it through . Because now I'm fighting the rain and feeling the storm because today I am left on the side and I don't know what to do . I never really thought id have to plan a day without you . <3 " 
No one can bring me down if my feet aren't touching the ground . You can never break my heart without me breaking yours . I stand tall even when I fall . So don't try breaking me cuz you will only break you <3 
When do you know when its time to let go and move on or when its the time to hold on tight and never give up ? <3

No one can underestimate me . There is only three people that can determine my success , that can determine where I go and what I do . And those people are Me , Myself and I . <3
