Both DUI and DWI are terms that refer to operating a motor vehicle while impaired by illegal drugs or alcohol . The biggest difference between the two is only in what the letters stand for . DWI is an acronym for driving while intoxicated or impaired and DUI stands for driving under the influence . Throughout the United States , the laws vary regarding how a DUI or DWI is dealt with

if you think that putting up a mosque 600 feet from ground zero and having the inauguration on the anniversary of September 11 , is immoral , inhumane , and a complete lack of respect for the memories of all that perished on that day and their survivors and that politicians are doing a grave injustice to the fallen heroes , their families and all the people of < PROPFEMALE > , please repost ! OMG ..

Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree ! 
Its so pretty out side 
This snow reminds me of living in Michigan . 
Happy Thanksgiving GOBBLE GOBBLE 
Yep and its snowing AGAIN 
I think I would like to be on a deserted Island on the beach with a frosty Coors in my hand .. yep thats it

WOMEN'S ASS SIZE STUDY ... There is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses ; the results were pretty interesting : 30% of women think their ass is too fat ... 10% of women think their ass is too skinny ... The remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he's a good man and that they wouldn't trade him for the world ! 
What a beautiful sunrise this morning . Wonder if people that go to PRISON get to see that . I dont think soooooooo .
