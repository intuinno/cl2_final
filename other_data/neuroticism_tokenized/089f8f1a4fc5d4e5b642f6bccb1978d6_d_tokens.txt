It really pissed my off , yet it's quite funny . && its so funny i might cry . That was kinda amazing . LOL 
Today , let's just say it was definately something . 
In a way , im excited for my magnet classes . \

Now i can say that i truely hate a person . \ 
Go somewhere and die , bitch . 
I can't play the guitar what so ever anymore . \ 
I wanted this year to be awesome . By the looks of it , it won't be . 
Im not good with poetry . \ 
>.< 
Sadface . \ 
:( 
I didn't like today , it sucked monkey cock . \ 
I loved the < PROPFIRST > bra conversation though . \ 
The only bright side of the day . D:< 
I tried Dr. Pepper the other day and its tasted nasty ; Why not give me cough medicine instead . That's exactly what it tastes like anyway . : & 
I had a horrible dream ; i woke up crying . 
Oh shit , picture day in three days . :O

I had a weird , but awesome dream last night . 
October is breast cancer awareness month . 
We have a science test tomorrow . \

Why not just crush me completely . 
The same person who laughs , talks a lot and seems happy , may also be the person who cry's themselves to sleep . \ 
I like this ' like ' so much . 
Yesterday was national coming out day . (: 
Ahhaha , ramen noodles . xD 
You are my wildest dream .? \ 
I throw up my heart each day , but am only forced to swallow it back down each time . 
Today was so fucking amazing ! \ 
I loved the feild trip . \ 
No classes , woo hoo ! \ 
Boodaye ! ? 
Awww .. I wish i could go to the Fright Dome . \

What if the thing that you think messed up your life didn't happen . How different would your life be ? \ 
I got this off < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s status . I like this question . \ 
Answer it for me please . (: 
The girl who seemed unbreakable broke , the girl who always laughed cried , the girl who never stop trying finally gave up . She dropped a fake smile as a tear ran down her cheek and she whispered to herself \i can't do this anymore\ " . \ 
Eating ice cream on a comfy couch on cold days while thinking back to amazing times makes me happy . 
This weekend actually felt really long . \ 
It felt a whole week long . I liked it . (: 
I have been so happy lately . \ 
:DDDD 
Thunder storms make me happy . \ 
I love them so much ?
