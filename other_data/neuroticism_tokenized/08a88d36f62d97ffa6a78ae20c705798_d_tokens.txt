Brave HEB on an empty stomach or not ? I need to get this done , but ... 
P . S . -- I want another tattoo . Something small . Leaning toward and ancient midwifery symbol behind my ear ( maybe ? ) . 
I know this is a lot of status updates in one sitting , but I had to tell ya : Just got word that part of my financial aid that I thought was denied is coming through ! It's not much ($750 ) , but every bit helps . Should have it Monday by the latest ! God is too good . 
Done with all tests ! Yay !

Beasted on 2 of her exams . Waiting for the 3rd ... :) 
Thank you Lord , an 87 , 88 and 100 on her first round of exams ! Nursing school may be in reach afterall . :D Now I have to bust my butt doing some housework . Hit the cell if you need me . 
Happy 21st birthday to my hubby ! I love you , < PROPMALE > ! I'm so proud of you -- always ! 
Feet hurt . PC sucks sometimes , man . :( 
Well you fell in the < PROPFEMALE > jar and lost your cool .... 
Chillin ' with the in-laws . 
pissy . Needs chocolate . 
just call me Doubting < PROPFIRST > . 
I think if we started a tap in my head , I'd probably survive and feel much better , right ? Sure . Get your gloves . I want my head back ! 
Happy Thanksgiving Day , Canada ! I , for one , am thankful for your delicious < PROPFEMALE > syrup . And < PROPMALE > Dooright , of course . 
Spent all day throwing her guts up ... and other unpleasant things . I just get over a heinous sinus infection and get hit with the stomach flu ??? Life is so cruel . P . S . -- Can't miss any more school , or classes start dropping me ( effing Blinn attendance Nazis ) and work will probably fire me as I've been out for over a week . What can I do though ??? 
May be sickly , but is accomplished . hah ! 
When will this end ???? I'm so sick of being sick . 
is praying that her Scuba prof doesn't drop her , but refuses to go , since puking in the pool is sometimes seen as a social/health faux pas . 
hey , ja-ja-jaded ... 
I'd hit it like a staff-weapon blast , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
information overload ! I have a test in literally every class this week . 2 of them are skills tests in classes that I haven't been able to attend in over 2 weeks . Woo ! 
Scrambling to catch up ... 
SOOOO pissed at Wells Fargo ... Wouldn't you do your little automated fraud call to see if I really was making those purchases ( which I did ) BEFORE you decide to cancel ALL PAYMENTS ?????? Dumbasses . 
Not enjoying life inside my head ... 
Way too much coffee . I am bouncing off the friggin ' walls ! WHOOOOOOOOO !

Hubby's taking me out to dinner on his study break . Yay ! 
is taking a mental sick leave from her Bio class this morning . I have a high A and no unexcused absences . F *** it . I need a break . BADLY . Will be back for other classes later on in the morning . 
Is wondering ( due to a class assignment ) what your thoughts are regarding baby sign language . Worth it , or not ? Developmental help or hindrance ? P . S . -- I already wrote my views , so you won't be influencing me one way or the other . In fact , I may not even comment back on this post . Just wondering what you think . 
is between a rock and an unfed llama ... 
Is relieved to know what's wrong with her . Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome . Basically a nice way of saying withdrawals . Who knew they could give you \microseizures\ " ( electric-shock feelings in the head and extreme vertigo ) ... " 
This is not going well ... 
Cannot abide the ignorant . 
Staying up to fight for early ( as possible ) registration . No more effing 7:45 am classes , plz !!!

Is turning into a forum troll ... Stupid people : if you don't know what you're talking about , research it . If you still don't know after that , STFU ! 
Emotionally drained . But had a great evening with her old friend , Shandy . 
Loves being married to this man . Plain and simple . He can make everything better just by sitting beside me . :) 
Hopes she can make it through these next few months ... no breaks in sight . 
Went to bed at 8:30 last night . It was awesome . Morning has been lovely too . :) 
Took the cat to the vet yesterday . I think that the highlight of the trip had to be when she broke into a sprint ( with me attached to the leash , sitting on the bench ) , leapt onto the grieving old couples ' heads ( the ones who'd just put down 2 of their dogs ) , and scale the 5 ft . display of kibble . Good times , good times . 
Needs to find a quiet place sometime in the next few days to take an hour-long IQ test so she can write a PSYC paper . Problem is , I do not HAVE any quiet places in my life ! AHHH ! No wonder I'm always freaked out and twitching ... huh . 
Planning ... it's what I do . 
Is not communicating effectively today . * sigh * 
Could listen to < PROPFIRST > Kucinich talk all damn day . But alas , class . 
Falling asleep at ther desk ... Thank God ONE of my bosses isn't here . lol . 
And the \head zaps\ " are back . * sigh * " 
Wants out of here . 
In lecture in bio , the topic is Origin of Replication , and due to all the Stargate SG-1 I've been watching this phrase sends me into a double panic ! 
Chillin ' with her Nea and her < PROPMALE > . 
Can't wait for Christmas . :)

VERY pissed at EA . 
at work , not feeling too great , thinking about everything I need to do before the end of the semester . * sigh * 
press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down , then click or scroll and magic circles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the < PROPFEMALE > ...

Is proud of her sister-in-law , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Roady , for making it into RICE UNIVERSITY !!! :) 
Trying not to judge her new math prof by the first CRAZY email she sent ... The last day of finals for FALL semester ... telling me that I need to buy 3 books/packets/computer programs BEFORE the first day of class ... Trying really hard . 
Just wants a good night's sleep , please . 
has taken care of the Walmart debacle and got a \free\ " tire out of the whole ordeal . :) " 
Can be a real jerk sometimes . :/ 
Could seriously eat about 3 of these sandwiches . Too bad I only have the one . Been craving turkey and provolone on < PROPFEMALE > wheatberry bread for a couple days now . 
' s account got hacked . I apologize to everyone who's been getting spam messages and comments . Should be fixed now . * sigh *

Deperately wants a manicure , though she dreads the conversation she will have to inevitably have with everyone there about her pachyonycia ... :/ 
Everywhere and messy ... cuz we just woke up ! 
Just discovered that all the music from their wedding was on < PROPMALE>'s hard drive ... the one that died . :( 
Let's see how forthcoming my facebook friends are . Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me . It can only be 1 word . No more than 1 word . Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This should be interesting ... Wonder if i have 20 , or more , brave friends who will participate ? 
Feels not-so-great . First TEAS test tomorrow 8am-2pm . Kill me now . 
Just left Blinn . I am so mad ... they wouldn't let me take my nursing test , as they had rescheduled the complete testing schedule WITHOUT notifying any of the students or even the people who sign students up for the test . Been fighting with them since 8 this morning about what to do and how to get my money back . It has NOT been a good day ... 
Praying for a better day than the last . 
I loved my dog in line at the bank because I'm a ninja ! 
Had fun last night with everyone . Apartment search went well today . Procrastinating on laundry and grocery shopping til later today . 
Antsy Pants 
< PROPFEMALE > ... I may have been hacked again . It keeps saying I've posted polls about people from an app that I don't have and is sending me notifications about people I don't know writing on the walls and posts of other people I don't know . Now what ?! 
Why the heck am I up this early ? Oh , yeah . Class . * Curses * 
Doesn't know if she can do this ... 
Chipper . 2 good lectures today and no work . I might actually get to see my husband ! 
My \fine\ " is $645.50 . . . OMGWTFBBQ " 
Double homicides down the street back home in Abilene , a trip to < PROPFEMALE>'s , and cookies and pao de quejo for breakfast ... Today has been interesting , to say the least . 
TALAE TALAE TALAE TALAE TALAE ... * Eyes roll * 
Is a walking pathogenic microbe , thanks to her klutzy Micro lab partner . Sigh . At least I was quarantined from going to work ? * shakes head * 
Sold her last textbook ( that's being reused this semester ) . Yay ! 
Is ... gasp ... cheerful . 
Naked Fish = fave . It's been a super-fantastic , wonderful , awesome day . :) I haven't had one of these in a looooong time ! 
Has been working so hard I didn't realize what time it was ! This is my first break of the day and apprently I need to leave in 25 minutes ! Whew ... at least I got a TON accomplished at work . :) 
On a Saturday night , I clean my closets . Something is wrong with this , huh ? 
It's freezing !!! 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status and the FIRST entry for your name under comments . 
Trying to pick an apartment ... * sigh * 
Is looking forward to seeing the Hoo-Ha Talks/Vulva Speeches/Cooter Discussions ( aka Vagina Monologues ) tomorrow night with Thais Macedo and < PROPFEMALE > Getterman . Also . Con is this weekend . It will be nice not to have to work it for once . 
Sad that he sweet baby brother is sick . :( 
Last day of Con . I turn 21 tonight at midnight at Dead Dog ! Whoop ! 
All I want for my birthday is to get to leave work ! :P 
Is gonna be lame and just have birthday order-in Chinese food . lol . It'll be nice to just chill . 
Thanks to everyone for their sweet birthday wishes !!! <3 
Chilling at home . Cold . Unproductive . Missing home . Thinking about Aiden , A&P , and pizza . 
Freezing ! Today was a Casa < PROPMALE > day at work . Nice . 
is utterly convinced that hot baths can solve all problems . 
trying to keep her zen before the 2 big anatomy tests in half an hour . Yes , he does lecture and lab exams on the same day . * cringe * 
Round 3 of testing begins in T-minus 8 hrs . I need sleep . And a miracle for Micro ... 
Not ready for Monday . 
Crazy snow ! Making some soup and locking myself away with < PROPMALE > Roady to eat soup . Maybe cheesecake and/or cocoa with Thais Macedo later . Get to see my mommy ( < PROPFEMALE > Smith ) and step-daddy ( < PROPFIRST > Smith ) and baby brother this weekend , provided they don't get snowed in . 
Is screwed . Hate Micro . 
Exhausted . Here's to hoping tomorrow goes more smoothly . 
Has had a rough day so far . Had to file a police report for harrassment this morning with campus police . I don't get people ... 
Had a great weekend with her family . Hope I can kick this sinus stuff before my nursing test this weekend ( and the 3 tests I have beforehand) ! 
Feeling awesome . Had a beautiful Gram Stain today and figured out without a doubt what my unknown organism is in Micro . Thank God ! I will need all the points I can get , since that test kicked my butt today . Nothing new for that class ... 
These angry phone calls at work are killing my zen . 
Good dinner . Relaxing night of studying ( < PROPMALE > history , so it's cool ) and gaming . :) 
Studying for my Nursing Entrance Test !!! 
Did incredibly well on my Nursing Entrance Test ! Now I have to finish the application ( due in April ) , get a TB test and serum titers done ( due with application ) and then we don't find out until JUNE ! Ugh ... 
Soooo ready for work to be over ! 
Ready for Spring Break to REALLY begin . :) 
drinking a < PROPFEMALE > Lifesaver and packing before bed . 
Abilene , Abilene , prettiest town I ever seen ... ( Yeah right ! ) 
' s fondest wish is for smooth sailing . 
Made it home . Just completed our first census . :) 
needs to be left alone for tonight . Need to chill and regroup . Tomorrow is gonna suck . 
Gets her new glasses today . Yay ! 
Is disappointed with life today . 
apparently I'm not allowed to receive financial aid for summer school if I've received financial aid for the long year ? Isn't that kind of the point of financial aid ? You can't pay for your education , so we help you ? 
Thought all day today that it was Friday already . Imagine my disappointment when I checked the calendar and remembered I had Tuesday/Thursday classes today . :( 
Wishes she spoke better Spanish for the sake of her callers at work when < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are out . 
Gets so much joy helping and educating pregnant women . I'm so happy I've found my passion and so impatient to start the real work ! 
Needs hot tea and a bath to calm down from reading all the misinformation and pure idiocy on myobsaidwhat.com . 
Got shot full of tuberculin ! w00t ! 
It feels good to DO good . :) 
You have suffered enough And warred with yourself It's time that you won Take this sinking boat and point it home We've still got time Raise your hopeful voice You had a choice You've made it now ... -- < PROPMALE > Hansgard and Marketa Irglova \Falling Slowly \"" 
Cleaned out SOOO much stuff from the closets today . Getting a jump on clearing stuff out before it's time to pack up and move . 
Happy Easter ! He is Risen ! 
Nervous breakdown ... 
Just dropped off my nursing school application ! AHHH ! Prayers please ! We won't know until May or June and there's still some follow up to be done , but yay ! 
Fighting my renewed Sims addiction ... have to finish this laundry or we'll have to go nekkid tomorrow ! 
I'm one of those uses-too-many-hyphens-to-string-together-adjective-phrases people . 
Grateful 
Missing my puppy . Been crying all morning ... :( 
Back to the grind . I have an unholy amount of work to get done this week . mom-and-sister-in-law are coming in at the end of the week and < PROPMALE > gets his ring on Friday , so at least those are some things to look forward to ! 
Cleaning nazi time ... 
has been with < PROPMALE > Roady for 5 years today . Awesome . :) Also , < PROPMALE > got shot today's date way back when . . . not quite as epic . 
So proud of < PROPMALE > Roady . Congrats on getting your ring today , love ! You TRULY deserve it . :) 
sushi with the sister-in-law in a bit . :) 
had a lot of fun this weekend . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Galloway Roady and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Roady . :) 
When did I stop being interesting ??? 
Bitch stole my cat ... 
Bitch did not steal my cat and has no idea how she got in . What's going on here ? 
I need a drink ... 
Watched the K-9 unit do demos outside her work for half an hour . Awesome ! 
\Softly call the Muster ... \"" 
Congrats to Buff < PROPFEMALE > Good and < PROPFIRST > Farrow on their wedding day ! They've worked so hard to get here . Love you both ! Best wishes ! 
is proud of < PROPMALE > Roady's 48 second ring dunk . :) 
Back to the daily grind . I need a nap ! 
Someone motivate me , please . . . 
Olfactory , Optical , Oculomotor , Trochlear , Trigeminal , Abducens , Facial , Vestibulocochlear , Glossopharyngeal , Vagus , Accessory , Hypoglossal ... 
is a snark machine . 
Hacked again ! Those Friend FAQ links are fakes ! DO NOT OPEN THEM ! I don't even have that app ! 
feels like crap just in time for finals . Yay Amoxicillin ! 
needs to take a chill pill and bring things back into perspective . 
our day off has turned out to be anything but . But at least I didn't have to strain myself intellectually very much today . Battled fleas ( more like battled the cat while she got a flea treatment ) , our microwave died and we had to get a new one , filled in nail holes , more packing ... ugh 
Happy Mother's Day to < PROPFEMALE > Smith ! Best mommy ev-ah ! I love you ! \ 
\ 
And Happy Mother's Day to < PROPFEMALE > Galloway Roady , my wonderful mother-in-law . XOXO 
I have so much to do and so very very little time in which to do it . . . This week may kill me . Ugh . 
2 Finals today , 1 tomorrow + work , and then packing til Saturday ! 
Is just braindead . One more final to go . I'm not sure I have it left in me . 
Packin packing packing . . . Should forage for food soon before my husband starves . 
Moved into the new place . It's awesome ! Thank you so so so so much to my wonderful parents and grandparents for all your help . We can't tell you how grateful we are . Love you ! 
WHOA @ the massive thunderstorm ! 
Has lost all track of time being out of school and moving . The phone on my work desk is telling me that it is Monday the 17th at 10:40 pm , which also does not help with my sense of time . 
My life may not be ideal , but I am so very blessed ! I have a husband who loves me and works hard for our future , an amazing family , the best friends anyone could ask for , a nice new place to live , and enough options for work and education that I know I can reach my goals , however long it may take . Thank you , God , for all you've done for me and all you are going to do ! 
Work , chores , unpack , sleep , repeat . 
is doing some serious soul-searching . Pray for/think of me , k ? 
Change of plans : looks like I will be graduating with an Associate's degree hopefully in August . Apparently , I am eligible for either of 2 . Who knew ? 
Wake up in the morning feeling like P . Diddy ... 
One day at a time ... 
I cannot be sick right now . This is not good . 
has aphthous stomatitis again : aka recurrent mouth/throat ulcers . Yay ! Well , at least I'm not contagious . Just in a world of hurt . \ 
Aside to my PCer friends : Do any of you or your children get mouth sores/ulcers on a fairly regular basis ? Apparently one cause/exacerbator can be the leukokeratosis/leukoplakia on our tongues . 
working all day , driving to Abilene tonight , AHS graduation tomorrow , turn around and come back Sunday , back to work all day Monday . 
Okay , Farmville is going away . Sorry , everyone ; I just never play it anymore . 
Had to swim into work . Goodness ! 
Even your emotions have an < PROPFEMALE > in so much space 
Had a nice lunch with her husband . Wish we could do that more often . Yum sushi . :) 
Nice chill Sunday . Back to the grind tomorrow . Better make the most of our last few hours before the alarm clock starts the week over again . 
Waiting for work to end so she can go watch Brasil play with her Brazilian second-family . :P 
Should have stayed in bed . Can't seem to get anything right this morning ! 
Burn it to the ground ... 
Doctor knickerbocker , knickerbocker number nine ! 
Desperatley misses El Chico's . Damn it , why is one of the only great things about Abilene their food ?! 
Who's going to the Texas Red's Festival , or would like to now that you know about it ? 
Texas Reds was Awesome ! New favorite wine : Sisters Who Sip ( Blueberry Pinot Noir ) from Cork This ! Winery in Montgomery . 
Happy Father's Day ! 
Back to work . Thank goodness < PROPMALE > and I are off next week ! We need that vacation ! Lake < PROPMALE > and Turner Falls , here we come ! 
We have a guest bed ! Whoop ! 
Heading to Oklahoma in the morning for our anniversary . Be back in town either the 30th or the 1st . Don't expect to see much of us til next week , though . We're outta here ! 
Church was nice . Trying to figure out what to do about the car/transportation . :/ 
Car is in the shop . Waiting on an estimate . Hopefully it will be done by tomorrow ; I start classes ! 
At Blinn . Summer II has begun . Just one month ... just one month ... just one month ... 
I just want to be everything in your eyes . 
You have suffered enough , and warred with yourself ; it's time that you won . . . 
Sometimes my ambitions get the better of me and I find my heart and mouth running ahead of my head ! 
This is absurd . 
Is it lunch time yet ? Is it ? Is it ? Can I go now ? Cuz I wanna go now ... 
Caffeine is my drug of choice . * jitters * 
It's official : I graduate in August with an A.A. in Psychology ( minor in Bio ) . Then it's off into the real world for a short stint before settling down with < PROPMALE>'s ( hopeful ) future job and flinging myself headlong into midwifery ! Life NEVER goes the way you plan , but sometimes it can be pretty great anyway . :) 
One set of house guests well-rested , well-fed and on their way , one more set coming in . It's been a busy weekend ! 
I was so restless last night . Woke up twice to jot down poetry and couldn't fall back asleep . Now that I have to be awake and functioning , I'm not sure that losing 3-4 hours of sleep was worth those 18 lines/4 stanzas ... 
My give-a-damn is busted . 
Our gerbil , Gandalf , is dying . :'( He and his brother Radagast were the first pets < PROPMALE > and I had together . It's going to be a hard night . 
Gandalf died this morning . :'( We're going to miss him . 
Feeling a little better today . Have only cried once so far today . Now I have to figure out how to get everything done these next two weeks without losing my mind ! 
I'm just so . . . tired . 
It was a long , but thoroughly rewarding trip . Got to see my family and had a blast at Aiden's 3rd b-day party ; the girls got back together ( love you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Pugh and Chanea Wells ! ) ; got to be there with the fam for mom-in-law's surgery ( < PROPFEMALE > Galloway Roady is recovering nicely ); even managed to get my homework done ! Love you all and miss you already , but I'll admit it's nice to be back in our own beds . :) 
Film critique term paper today , final tomorrow , interview Friday ! :) 
Is super proud of her bestie , Chanea Wells ! :) Great song , babygirl . You're going places . 
Finished my final with a 92 ! Should be an official Blinn College graduate by tomorrow night . No more classes for at least a year ! YESSSS !!! 
Has an interview today ! Wish me luck ; I really want this job !!! 
Interview is done . I think it went nicely . Keep your fingers crossed for me !

It's going to be one hell of a day !

If you have a wonderful man , who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you , who works hard and would do anything for you , who makes you laugh , that's your best friend , who you want to grow old with , who is your world & someone that you're thankful for everyday , then post this as your status ? 
Has an Associates degree . :) 
Just hired my replacement . He's awesome and we all love him , but it's still bittersweet . I love my job/coworkers and they will be hard to leave . Doubly so , as I do not yet have a job for myself lined up . :/ 
? Drop of a hat , she's as willing as , playful as a pussycat , Then momentarily out of action , temporarily out of gas , She'll absolutely drive you wild ! ? 
C8H10N4O2 FTW ! 
Does anyone know when the refunds are supposed to start for Texas A&M scholarships/loan disbursements ?

Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that the\ 
people will understand the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The \

Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . 93% won't copy/paste this . \ 
Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
Flowers delivered safely . Cleaning , doing some paperwork , and getting ready for sister-in-law and RenFest this weekend ! Whoop ! 
Had an awesome time at RenFest ! :) 
Anyone know someone/someplace that's hiring ? 
Up baking bread and folding laundry . Such a good wife ; such a bad feminist ...

Needs to go prove to A&M that she is married . I wonder if they accept proof in the form of public consummation or if I really have to dig through the lock box to find a copy of the marriage license ... 
STOP ! \

Grandparents are in town . :) 
Weird question : Is there any place in town that I can buy temporary tattoo transfer paper ? The kind you run through an inkjet printer ? Or do I need to suck it up and order online/pay shipping costs ? On the flip side , is there any amazing ( not just good ; FANTASTIC level ) artist * Cough < PROPFEMALE > Walden , Cough * in town that would be willing to give me a massive permanent marker/paint/something tattoo for Friday night ? 
Car is in the shop again . 
ATTENTION :\ 
If you are on the A&M Campus , please seek shelter AWAY from Rudder \ 
tower ! A gunman has been spotted and police are setting up a command \ 
center and calling in the College Station SWAT team . I know some people have \ 
not yet received the Code Maroon , since they were first sent out at 4 \ 
pm . Again , please seek shelter AWAY from Rudder Tower ! 
No\ 
armed subject found at this time . Police are still searching .. \ 
Continue to shelter in safe place . Bus pickup to exit campus- GO TO < PROPFIRST > ST\ 
BEHIND < PROPMALE > DINING HALL . 4:33 pm . According to KBTX , an additional sighting has been reported on west Campus . 
Glad that the ' gunman ' scare turned out to be a false alarm . In other news , just got back from a lovely scholarship dinner for < PROPMALE > . FINALLY got to meet his donor . :) 
Loving The Feminist Breeder's latest blog post ! Rock on , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Had a blast at the Cepheid Variable Masquerade Ball ! Also , my corset is fab . :) 
Got her re-acceptance letter from A&M . Whoop ! Still a lot of paperwork to fill out/rules to fight , but they said yes . :) I start back up this January . 
Doesn't wanna go to the store and you can't make her ! * holds breath * 
Making beer bread . Be jealous . 
Just turned the heater on for the first time this year . It's heavenly . :)

Has 28 days to relearn a language to near fluency . 
It's an Anberlin kind of day . Mostly their older stuff . * nod * 
Can find neither her French dictionary nor her verb conjugation book . Merde ... 
Plus ça change , plus c'est la même chose . 
is exhausted ! Been hauling winter clothes upstairs and summer clothes downstairs . * Panting * 
Baking with my husband , then Cepheid and D-Raid ! 
Never forget : 11-18-99 . May the Spirit always burn bright . 
Is having a super healthy breakfast of tamales . Reminds me of when I was little and my grandma would take me to Hernandez Bakery for breakfast and we'd pile up on sweet breads and tamales . I miss her . And Abilene , sometimes ... 
ZOMG ! < PROPMALE > Potter ! :D 
PLEASE READ ! If someone comes to your front door and asks you to remove your clothes and dance with your arms in the air , DO NOT do this ! It is a scam ! They just want to see you naked ! Please copy and paste this to your status . I wish I had received this yesterday . I feel stupid . ;) 
Heading outta town this afternoon . Y'all have fun ! 
Back home . Had a great weekend with family ! :) 
just finished registering for her Spring classes at A&M . This is going to be an ... interesting ... semester . 
Does anyone in C-Stat need a printer/copier/scanner ( Canon M190) ? It's nice and works ( will need some new ink fairly soon , but we've used the cheaper off-brand and it works just fine with it ) . We were given a new one , so if you are willing to get it out of my house , it's yours , free-of-charge . :) 
Facebook makes life so much more pleasant and simple . Truly , it does . 
loves making lists of things to do . Does not love doing those things nearly as much ... 
Feeling a bit blue . Just one of those days ( weeks ? ) . 
I'm sick of following my dreams . I'm just going to ask them where they're goin ' , and hook up with them later .... 
Loved Tangled ! Loved loved loved loved loved ! 
Been studying French like crazy all day ! Placement/credit test tonight 5-7 pm . Just need to go over passe compose and prepositions/geography one last time , then I'm leaving it up to < PROPMALE > ( and hopefully competency ? ) . 
Placed into French 201 ( means I was able to test out of 2 classes -- 8 credit hours) ! Yay ! 
Also confirmed : I do NOT have to add a minor ! WHOOP ! That means I can actually graduate on time with < PROPMALE > after all . It's been a good day on the education front here . :) 
Has the sweetest husband ever ! Instead of sleeping in and studying for his finals , he's up at 8 , going to play < PROPFEMALE > for underprivileged children who's < PROPFEMALE > date would have otherwise been cancelled . :) I love him ! 
It's been a pretty darn good day . Super nice outside , too . :) 
Has a job interview Monday at 10 am with the College of Engineering . Wish me luck ! I really want this job ! 
Getting ready for my interview ! 
Got the job ! I start on the 3rd . Thanks for all the well wishes and prayers ! 
Getting stir crazy ... think I'm going to overhaul the office at home today . * cue insanity * 
Got a brand new planner ( you have no idea how much this excites me ... ) and am cleaning out the office . The weather outside is sooo pretty , if a little hot . Had lunch with my hubby and we start baking Christmas gifts tonight . I'm having a really good day ! 
Phase one of Operation Bake-All-The-Things complete . Verdict : Success ! 
Heading to Abilene in the morning . My phone is acting a little weird , so if you need me and can't get through , call < PROPMALE>'s phone . Love you all !!! < PROPFEMALE > ( almost ) Christmas ! 
So , my phone is completely dead . I still have the same number and a temporary phone , but do not have access to any of my old < PROPFIRST > . If you would like me to have your number , please either message me on here or , if you have MY phone number , please send me a txt with your name ( full name ) . Thanks ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Hope everyone had a great Christmas ! Ours was nice , even though < PROPMALE > has been sick all day :( \

Got a new phone on a new network . ( Thank you , < PROPMALE > Roady ! )If you're Sprint , we can talk for free . I'll be sending out/asking for < PROPFIRST > soon . 
Had a good first day of work , but glad to be home ( even though there's still lots to do here ) . 
Another day another dollar . 
In a world of hurt today . This weather+pachyonychia is 
Finally got all our old textbooks posted . Already sold 4 this weekend . Keep your fingers crossed that they all go ! 
Being an adult today ; getting stuff done . 
First day back at A&M in almost 2 years . Wish me luck ! 
Sooo tired . Long first day . Already have homework . 
Just made a very wise choice ; thank you no-penalty add/drop period . That class was gonna blow . This one sounds pretty neat . :) 
Watching a couple kids roll around a D20 outside < PROPFIRST>'s Deli . Warms the cockles of my geeky heart . :) 
It's not been a good day . Can we just start over ? 
My first wisdom tooth is coming in . :( 
Way behind and just . . . Tired . 
homework is eating my soul ... 
Snow day ! Snow day ! Snow day ! YAY ! 
Having a pretty good day . Btw , Inception was awesome ! 
Thank you , everyone , for my Birthday wishes ! I <3 you all ! 
Thank you all so much for my birthday wishes ! I would thank you each individually , but I am far too blessed with friendships to have enough time ! :) 
I would like all my Facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right . Just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status . :) 
Completing our FAFSAs for the year . What fun ! 
Why is it that the study of formal logic is so utterly intuitively illogical ? I love the class , but ... whoa . 
Rough day . Just want a nap ... 
Barely staying awake in my classes today . Blah . 
OMG ! Due to the freeze , our electric < PROPMALE > is DOUBLE what it was last time . And last time's was high to begin with . This is insane ... 
GREEN ! 
Should have worn shorts today ! 
On the road to ConDFW . :) 
Working < PROPFEMALE > auction at ConDFW . 
Getting interviewed about the fire in Zachry . 
Theses essays are killing me ! 
is excited ! Get to see my family today ! :D 
Would anyone be able to watch our cat and gerbil ( in College Station ) over Spring Break for free or pretty cheaply ? Either in your home or make daily visits to ours ? 
Studying for my first Logic exam . So far , so good . 
If there is a cepheid at the tables , would you please look around for a blue metal water bottle with trees on it ? It may be on the little hutch/table . Thnx ! 
I'm a banana ! 
Skipping class to write essays . * Sigh * 
4 essays down , the hardest one left to go . 
HAHAHAHA ! Finished with this stupid 5 essay midterm ! Whoop ! * dances , then collapses from mental exhaustion * 
Dentist today . Think happy thoughts ... 
Lots of $$$ dental work in my future . * sigh * It's always something ... 
Living it up in < PROPFIRST > . :) 
Zilker botanical gardens . :) 
' S day is already miserable . I just wanna go home . :( 
Class then Con set up . :) 
Shoulda just stayed home ... 
So much to do ! 
I need to start taking photos now that I have a camera that works . 
Between rollerblading , good food with friends , Petting lots of kitties , Crispin hard cider ( delicious ! ) , and Spring Awakening , I guess this weekend hasn't been a total loss afterall . 
Feelin ' left out again . It kinda just been a crap week altogether . Trying hard to shrug it all off . 
PC patient count is up to 984 ( 399 registered in the IPCRR ) as of March 2011 . Awesome ! 
A&M friends , other than Sci Fi , what 300-400 level English Lit Classes do you recommend ? 
With my freeze ray\ 
I will find the time to\ 
Find the words to\ 
Tell you how\ 
How you make\ 
Make me feel\ 
What’s the phrase ? \ 
Like a fool\ 
Kind of sick\ 
Special needs\ 
Anyways ... 
So , my fellow Cepheids , I just retook the purity test . I have gone down to a 28.8% . I think it is time to keep me secluded from civil society ... 
Thank God this week is over . Dealing with things one at a time ... 
If your mom was/is a hardworking woman , and was/still is your hero , helped you no matter how bad you were , or what kind of trouble you were in , or was just the BEST mom ever , if you are blessed to still have her , or even if she is your angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are PROUD of your Mom . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one Mom . ??? 
Great day . Having a blast ! 
Work , work , work , work , work ... I am so ready for this semester to be over . This week is going to be rough . 
All hopped up on C8H10N4O2 . 
Gotta start writing this paper ! I am just stuck . Ugh . 
I think the tabs I currently have open on my computer sum up my life at the moment nicely : Facebook , Gmail ( with forwarded NEO ) , WellsFargo ( so I can balance my checkbook/cry about being a brokeass college student ) , grad school search for my hubby , Texas Parks and Wildlife website , Iranian Divorce Court article/stats ( and accompanying essay being written in Word ) , a feminist birth advocacy site , and 3 webcomics . 
Wow ! Big night ! After a decade , Osama bin Laden has been killed . It's so surreal . 
I did the math last night ... by the time this week is over , I will have written 28 essays this semester . By the time finals are done , I will have written a grand total of 30 . My eloquence is markedly suffering and with each subsequent essay I sound more and more as though I am trying to explain patriarchy to 3rd graders . FML . 
< PROPMALE > just answered a question that I * thought * , but did not actually * ask * . We were not even looking at one another , so the nonverbal thing wasn't a factor . Oh yeah , we are THAT couple ... 
I will pay someone to write these gd essays . For reals ... 
Fighting heat sickness , battling through these practice problems ... like a boss ! 
Yeah ... the studying I'm supposed to be doing ... about that ? INTERNET FOREVER !!!! 1111 !!! 1 
Last final of the semester coming up in half an hour . Whoop ! 
I am probably one of the only women who actually enjoys going to their yearly because I get a full hour of great conversation about my field . 
My back is killing me ! So ready to go home and take a nap . 
Bridesmaids was awesome ! Chick version of The Hangover . Loved it ! Also loved getting to see my @ < PROPFEMALE > Getterman . :) 
Cannot abide the presumptuous attitudes of those in perceived positions of authority . 
Just ordered my Aggie ring ! 
Oral surgery in the morning . Thoughts and prayers would be greatly appreciated . 
Surgery went well . Very sore and still numb in places , but taking meds and doing okay . Thank you for your prayers ! 
Maybe I spoke too soon ... analgesia finally wearing off and OMG ! At least < PROPMALE > is a good nurse and I have some pain meds . Gonna try to sleep some of it off . 
I look and feel like an abused chipmunk ... * sad puffy face * 
Today has been pretty awesome . Had a good follow up appt . ( Have another in 2 weeks ) , got my sutures out and found some pretty dresses for all the upcoming weddings this summer . :) 
What a crappy day . :( 
Dear Facebook , thanks for reminding me that my wedding anniversary is on Monday . I never would have known !!! 
Anniversary weekend : day 1 - Messina Hof . =D 
Anniversary weekend : day/night 2 - 7F Lodge in the < PROPFEMALE > cabin with in-room massages and 2 person whirlpool tub . Heck yes . 
Anniversary weekend : day 3 ( actual anniversary ) - Bluebell Creamery tour in Brenham and back home . 
Another long weekend ahead . Yesssssss . :) 
Car broke down in Rogers . Greeeeeat . 
Our little gerbil , Radagast , died last night . Sad day , but he went peacefully and maybe now he can meet up with his brother , Gandalf , again . 
Beautiful wedding ! Congrats , < PROPFEMALE > Dickson and < PROPFIRST > Howell ! 
The new Emerging Technologies Building ( Industrial Engineering/Biomedical Engineering building where I work and < PROPMALE > has his research lab ) is gorgeous , but we're still working out a few kinks . One example : The water fountain that shoots water high onto the wall with frightening similarity to a Jurassic Park velociraptor . 
My gmail must have stopped importing my Neo/Tamu mail last week without my noticing it . Now when I try to import it again it won't let me . What's the deal ? 
What a day ... 
Lets see who fully reads this : Leave me a 1 word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of your LAST NAME ... it can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you .... Don't just post a word and not copy ... That's no fun :) 
Sooo , our cat is addicted to dried apricots . 
If I close my eyes really tight , do you think people will ignore me today and just let me be ? Hard day when you just wanna be left alone but work in the front office . 
Please post this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by Reavers and is now a hood ornament on a Reaver ship . 85 percent of people won't copy this as their status because they have no idea what a Reaver is ; 10 percent will start speaking Chinese or say something profound like \I swear by my pretty floral bonnet I will end you \"; and 5 percent will start singing \ " The Hero of Canton . \"" 
O'Bannon's with friends . Good night ! 
Much needed swimming and D-Raid . It's been a loooooong day . 
Moody and quiet today . Don't wanna be here . I'll get over it ... 
Haircut ! Winning ! 
Just got my super pale face powder all over my black shirt . Lovely ... 
It's been a stressful past few days . Blah . Weekend was not supposed to be this way . 
Dentist appt . They unscrew one post from my jaw and screw another one in . Fun ! Maybe they'll finally give me a tooth to put on this stinking post ! 
The reading list for my women's lit class : Frankenstein ( winning ! ) , < PROPFEMALE > ( kill me now ) , The Mill on the Floss ( wtf ? ) , and Lady Audley's Secret ( Gag ! ) . Why can we never examine works by , you know , GOOD female authors ? Huh ? Or maybe even some * gasp * contemporary works ? I know , I know , perish the thought that any but the comedy of manners genre could possess any literary merit ... * sigh * How about some Atwood , < PROPFEMALE > Guin , Tan , < PROPMALE > , Kingsolver , Fitch , Diamont , Morrison , Oates , Plath , Nin . . . 
So , there's this new neighbor in our complex . He's this little asian man whose apartment contains ( from what I can tell ) only a pink lamp , a desk , chair , and computer . But the thing is , he likes to sit at that desk , on his computer , every single night , with the blinds wide open , wearing only a pair of men's slippers . Yuuuuuup ... 
Is tired of money . Anyone want to start a commune where goods/services are based off the barter system with me ? < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Pugh , we could have cows ... 
Can't focus . Want to go do fun , not-work-related things !

Ags , I need your opinion on a VERY serious issue : Is it okay for me to walk alone under the Century Tree , barring the strange looks I will undoubtedly get , if I am 1 . ) already married , and 2 . ) previously walked with aforementioned spouse under the Tree before marriage ( and I think since) ? In my case would it be a null effect or does the tree portend marital dissolution as well if you dare walk solitary beneath it ? Just always wondered . Made me nervous every time I went to class in Bolton ... LOL ! 
Too . Much . STRESS . 
Got my Aggie Ring ticket . :) 5:45 this Friday . WHOOP ! 
Must write paper . Cannot write paper . MUST write paper ! * Shiny object of distraction * 
Cracks me up when women say they don't like feminism . Really ? Then I'm coming over and taking your voter registration card , any property you own , and your birth control . I will also be reverting the legal definition of \wife\ " to mean \ " servant\ " as it did just a few decades ago . Inequality rules ! " 
My ( 4-yr . old ) brother is in the hospital with asthma and a severe sinus infection . Prayers/thoughts , please !

Hates being treated like an imposition . 
Officially caught the Corps Crud . File under #thingsididn'tmissaboutTAMU 
We never really grow up . We just learn how to act in public . 
Just had to send lecture material corrections to my Women's health professor . The statistics she is using are from 1999 ! The whole class is one giant mess of misinformation , but seriously ?! 
About to take a test . Can't focus . Ugh . 
Got the first part of ( one of ) my annotated bibliography done ! Whoop ! I may be a month behind , but this sucker is going down . Part 2 deadline : Wednesday night . Bring it . 
I'm loving this thick fog ! Favorite weather . :) 
So , for anyone who does not already know ( or hasn't guessed ! Haha ! ) . . . \ 
I'm Pregnant !!! ( And < PROPMALE > helped ! :D ) 
Tonight is definitely a white chicken chili night . Need some avocado to go on top . Yum . 
Well , this day could have definitely been a whole lot better . Oh well , glad it's nearly done . 
Apparently my messages are acting strangely . If it seems like I have not responded to you , it is likely that I did not receive your message . I am getting them sometimes more than a day after they were sent . Not sure why . Just a heads up . 
May I ask a personal favor .... only some of you will do it , and I know who you are , if you know someone who fought cancer and passed away , or someone who is still fighting ... please add this to your status for 1 hour as a < PROPFIRST > of respect and remembrance , I hope I was right about the people who will . \ 
Love you , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Had my first ever migraine this morning from 6am-12pm with searing pain , nausea , and vomiting . I honestly thought I was going to either need to be hospitalized or die . Let's never do that again , shall we ? 
Just finished watching Black Butler ... whoa . 
It has seriously been the weirdest day at work . I've been doing more advising than the real advisor today . I am worn out ! 
Time does not make sense today . Time change is messing with me still , I guess .
