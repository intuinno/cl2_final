Happy New Year . Thanks for all the wishes for Zag , he is a < PROPMALE > of goldens ! To top it off I did a majpr sprain * they think * of my back so I can't see Gatse until I am more mobile ( read off thr exact pillow and hoptpad configuration with the triamvirite ofd drugs ..... I know the physical pains will heal easily , but losing my best friend is hard . Thank you everyone ! It means a lot to me . Hugs to all , < PROPFEMALE > 

OMG , on top of joining facebook , my Ipod died and I am now going to be an Itouch owner ..... Anyone have favorite apps you can recommend ? 
Yeh , going to take some time off over the next two weeks and get away from work ! Hope we don't have too much impact from Hurricane Bill (: 
Christian and I had a lovely visit with his daughter < PROPFEMALE > the last couple of days . We toured , read , relaxed , played with computers :) , and ate ! Can't wait until both < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > can visit together !!!! Watch out Cape < PROPFEMALE > :))))) 
Just got back from a quick getaway to the White Mountains . Weather was fantastic ! Hope to post photos soon . 
So nice to take a week off ! Everyone have a great long weekend ! 
Some photos of our brief trip to the White Mountains last week . 
Yuck , back to work and the grind and right back immediately into the mire ! Time off was wonderful and C and I enjoyed it so much . Oh well , pays the bills ...... 
For the New Orleans dinner I will make Chicken Big Mamou on pasta and an appetizer :) 
Yuck , rainy weekend coming . Gatse is doing brilliantly though ! < PROPFEMALE > Yuckens worked with him and < PROPFEMALE > the last couple of weeks at third level , his canter is to die for ! 
Had a great time at Yankee stadium on Friday except the Soxs never showed up :((( 
Pats really blew it last night , very disappointing ! 
Hi everyone . Things have been nuts with Zag but I have to report a lot of improvement ! Meeting with the oncologist tomorrow am ...... Then we will really know the prognosis . Please everyone , send good thoughts .... 
Well , we thought we were off for an adventure but circumstances intervened .... trying again tomorrow :) 
Well we're ...... back ! Short but very sweet ! 18 1-4 ft iguanas yesterday am sitting on the trees below the condo ... hummingbirds flitting across the deck .... views of St < PROPFIRST > and BVI :))))) 94 yesterday to what , 40's today YIKES ! What do I miss the most ? The water and fishies , and the view . Pics to come . 
Zag is doing really well on chemo , acting like a puppy at 10 with lymphosarcoma still on the liver with the spleen and adrenal gland gone . We'll see ....... But it is awesome to have him come back to life , even for awhile . 
The game was soooo close , we faded ....... Bad loss ! 
Happy Thanksgiving to all , and their families both two and four legged ! 
Hey when life deal you lemons , make lemondade . Just remember to add something special :) 
New Orlean's Rocks !!!!!!!! Thank god a real team finally won a Superbowl ( obviously Pats excepted ) . 
Nice long weekend ... happy for the no'easter LOL ! Riding in the plan , maybe a day trip to go over the bridge :) 
Nasty weather , all meetings in W < PROPFEMALE > cancelled , fantastic ! But a very bad cold thanks to the audience in Saratoga last week :( Good that is rain here . 
Still battling the aftermath of the pneu/bronch thing , that is why I hate to go to public meetings ! Want my strength back to ride and workout . At least it is lighter at night :))) not that we can see it with the 4\ of rain :( " 
I'm still battling this * thing * but I think I have turned the corner . Want SO MUCH to get back to the land of the living ! 
Very excited to have C moving in , tomorrow is the final day with the mass move , thanks in advance Seb ! 
Well , the bad news is in because I have not been able to ride since my trip to Chicago . Knee replacement on the left is going to happen , going through the appt issues for clearance etc . Bummer but good . I need to be able to ride :)))))) \ 
\ 
I have also been traveling the past weeks so am way behind on everything ! Nashville and surrounding areas were more devastated than the news showed . 
Thank you everyone for your b'day wishes ! The weather cooperated , so it was a nice lazy dazs in the sun , but the boat didn't get into the water because an incredible dink couldn't get out of the way for 45+ minutes ARGH gotta love Granite Pier . Gatse was off so no fun on that front . I am likely going to try riding who cares about pain if it is going to be gone soon .... we''ll see . 
Well , surgery date is June 11th thanks to my friend who is my doc ! I will then have two bionic knees to travel to < PROPFEMALE > in September . Everyone please keep your fingers crossed for a great outcome !!!!! 
Well , tomorrow I become truly bionic :) Please think good thoughts for me . 
Hi all . I am up and walking without the crutches except when doggies are around . The knee is doing really well , but where they cut the tissue I still have a ton of swelling and lack of mobility . Bummer that it is not going as smoothly as the other one . \ 
But it will be good . \ 
Everyone have a great holiday ! 
Yippy ! Gatse did his first flying c < PROPFEMALE > e the second day out ( to the left , right he still hasn't got the < PROPFEMALE > of the hind legs , it will come ! ) Taking it slow with him because he is such a sponge and tries so hard . < PROPFEMALE > is loving where he is at . Going to start competing again next year at 3rd level . \ 
Stopped by the NE Friesian show this weekend , it seemed like there wasn't a great turnout which is too bad . 
Today my doc gave me the go-ahead to ride , the only problem is it is my left leg and I'm not sure I am strong enough to mount and god knows I could never figure out how to get on from the right LOL ! 
Hi all , I appreciate the b'day wishes but it is in May , and it is correctly entered in my account . So maybe there is another < PROPFEMALE > S that is celebrating ???? 
I rode Gatse today after returning from two weeks in < PROPFEMALE > with Christian and friends . Gatse was awesome , he amazes me every time I ride him . \ 
My new ( other ) bionic knee is working well and only had a small impact on our trip . < PROPFEMALE > was incredible , I hope to post some pics soon . 
Wow , back to work full force after vacation ! Amazing how things can go from slow to fast in an incredibly short time .... Slowly but surely coming up to full force . The next year is going to be hell , but hopefully worth it . 
Wow , check out Jupiter ! 
I heard this from a friend and checked . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > ( belated happy b'day ) , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , Shep , Tilde . Your phone < PROPFIRST > are on Facebook . Just an FYI if you want to remove them ! 
His name is Zorro ..... ( have to follow the Ziggy , Zag , Zeus trail ) . He is INCREDIBLE ! A monument to < PROPFEMALE>'s breeding . Super smart , bold , affectionate , gorgeously pu t-t ogether ! But you have to like dark goldens and that is our thing and < PROPFEMALE > s , totally within standard . 
Just can't wait ! Will post more when Zor ( Zorro tentavely Sunnybrae Sunset Starchaser ) Zorro means < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and I am trying to name back to it . 
It wasn't pretty , but the Pats won ! 
Zor is home and is SO smart ! Over at the Rockport house so I can't download a pic , will get the cable tomorrow ! Nothing like a < PROPFEMALE > retriever pup to feed the soul and remind us of the good stuff in life ! 
Forgot to say , last weekend the < PROPFEMALE > clinic with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Peters was unbelievable ! Learned so much , and watching them hop on the clinicians horses - can you say new horse ? :)))))) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all :) > \
