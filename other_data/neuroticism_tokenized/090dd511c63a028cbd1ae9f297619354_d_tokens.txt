Almost went the first three weeks of school without falling asleep in class . But the 10 minute nap in Biology was totally worth breaking that lol . 
While I was waiting for a friend at the park-who didn't show up- I was sitting on a bench , apparently half in the sun half in the shade since only half of me is sunburned . :|
