I'm giving you my heart , and all that is within , I lay it all down for the sake of you my < PROPMALE > . I'm giving you my dreams , I'm laying down my rights , I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life . And I surrender all to you , all to You . I'm singing you this song , I'm waiting at the cross , And all the world holds dear , I count it all as loss . ~ James , < PROPMALE > VINEYARD SONGS 
I'm waiting ... For making informed decisions For knowing what God requires of me For what He is going to say For giving my heart I'm letting go ... Of my pride Of my plans for my life Of my own desires Of wanting everything NOW He is Faithful !!
