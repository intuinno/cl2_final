I know you are , but what am I 
O Lord , though I have no feeling of confidence in you , I know that You are my God , that I am all Yours , and that I have no hope but in your goodness ; so , I abandon myself entirely into you 
< PROPFIRST > Lennon , was one of the best musicians of all time 
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round I really love to watch them roll No longer riding on the merry-go-round I just had to let it go 
Your hand will reach all your enemies ; your right hand will reach your foes ! At the time of your coming you will drive them into a furnace . Then the LORD'S anger will consume them , devour them with fire . Even their descendants you will wipe out from the earth , their offspring from the human race . 
Good Friday 
Be yourself , it's all that you can do

Asking if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . Too many to mention have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see ... this in the status ... of all my friends .. ? 
Eyes upon me\ 
Watching me in my perpetual sleep\ 
Dreams deceive me\ 
My future depends on a mindless dream\ 
I've fallen from promises\ 
Damned to take risks on my own\ 
The masterful science that freezes your\ 
Mind and your soul\ 
The wretched dream is realized\ 
The human race is to be crystallized 
Just some lyrics from a song that I like 
I love talking to local celebrities 
I miss < PROPMALE > 
Is it wrong of me to think that < PROPFIRST > Sheen is cool ? 
No offense to < PROPMALE > Knots , but Mr. Roper was far better than Mr. Furley
