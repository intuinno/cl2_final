I called my mom a weirdo , she replied with \I know you are but what am I ? \ " XD "

I wonder what would happen if you hired two private investigators to track each other ... 
The difficult times we go through , they shape who we are . Everytime you come across a rough patch , you change . For the better , or the worse , it's your choice . Without the problems and tough times , we wouldn't appreciate the awesome times we now < PROPFEMALE > . <3

You shut your mouth when your talkin ' to me !

\Do what you can with what you have where you are . \"" 
R.I.P. < PROPMALE > . today wasn't the best , but friends help you forget . 
You never completely move on from losing someone you love . 
It's ridiculous . 
When a relationship becomes work , and more is going into it than either of you are getting out , it's time to fix it- or end it . 
Is tired of man-whores . 
Chillin ' (: 
You have to show the people you care , that you truly care about them . When people are loved , it gives them something to live for . Everyone is fighting battles inside . You never know , your friendship could be all they need to survive . 
Copy this into your status and see what people rate you . 1 : Crazy . 2 : I'd marry you . 3 Talkative . 4 : Sassy . 5 : Loveable . 6 : Too nice . 7 : Moody . 8 : Sexy . 9 : Spoiled . 10 : Mouthy . 11 : Random . 12 : Hot . 13 : Funny . 14 : Fit . 15 : Amazing . 16 : Beautiful . 17 : Cute . 18 : Smart ass . 19 : bubbly . 20 : loyal .

Hmmmm , Darnnnn , leaving Melissas soon/ : then it's back to the house . But I had A LOT of fun yesterday and I'm sooooo glad I went with her to the Y . :D ! 
If you choke a smurf , what color does he turn ? And Why is it that when someone tells you that there’s billions of stars in the universe , you believe them . But if they tell you there’s wet paint somewhere you have to touch it ? 
It's Independence Day . ^.^ ?

A heart is not judged by how much you love ; but by how much you are loved by others . 
Relaxing in my bed ..

wants to dance . 
I would rather try and fail , than to never give it a go . 
Am I the only person who looks at someone who's smiling , and wonder if they're actually happy/not faking it ? 
It takes way too much energy to harbor anger and hostility all the time . 
hmmmmmm , so , is this when I find out you're fake or later ? 
Can never get to sleep anymore /: 
A recent police study found that you’re much more likely to get shot by a fat cop if you run .

I don't give a FUNYUN ! 
Life has its ups and downs , but as long as I have my friends I'll be smiling . 
You don't have to be blood to be family . 
Home is where you feel welcome . 
In a few years you'll want to kick yourself for all the stupid things you let people you fall in love with do to you . 
Sabes que .. tu eres < PROPFEMALE > perdedor . 
Soooo .... awkward .... 
Just got home from the fair , (: Went to the mall then headed to The Band < PROPFIRST > and the < PROPFIRST > Currington concert , it was uh-maze-ing . Woulda had a super-awesome day if my dad came with a mute button or stayed home .

Happy 18th birthday to my brother , he's all growed up /: ( how much is admission to the game tmw night ? ) 
Laying down thinking about the football game ( we got stomped 42-12 ) , and how much i dont wanna do my homework 
Sometimes Mondays suck even when there isn't school . 
Sometimes I debate on deleting my myspace and my facebook because I feel like people are stalking me ...

Wishes tomorrow would hurry up . Fridays the best day of the week . friends , Football games , and the start of the weekend . Cant wait ! 
-Is so fed up with being treated like i dont mean anything . This is why i try to only rely on myself , and dont really like trusting people . Its like setti 
-ng yourself up to get knocked down . 
Going to the football game tonight , see yall there ? ( :

Some of the best things , things we're given , we take for granted- our house , our siblings , our education , freedom of religion , free will , even food . Many things go forever without being appreciated . When was the last time you told your parents ( sincerely ) thank you and that you love them ? 
its 10:10 on 10/10/10 make a wish 
Someone does you wrong , then after a while you forgive them , letting go of the past . There's one way to figure out if you've truly gotten over it- if given the < PROPMALE > to get back at that person , would you do it ? Would you take revenge ?.. 
If you knew me you would know ...

I dare someone to try and cut off my wings 
A person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
I hate how you can have an amazing morning and then one person mess it all up and put you in a bad mood .

Its only a mistake if you dont learn from it . 
Okay , well , it's one thing to be mad at me for stupid stuff , and hold grudges against me , but if you've got a problem with me , don't say or do stuff to my 12 year old sister- it's petty . And if you have a problem with me , confront me not her . You can be mean to me all you want , but you will not touch , threaten , insult , ( etc . ) my sister .
