Got back to my fieldwork church today , and all i can think is \fieldwork is my favorite part of Seminary . \"" 
first real test for the Huskers .... how will they do ? 
How sad is your life when you get really excited that there is a brand new roll of TP in the bathroom ? 
The Huskers didn't look pretty today , we'll be dropping several spots in the polls , and with that Texas loss it doesn't look good for a National Championship run without some losses by Bama , Ohio State , and Boise State . 
SO MUCH HOMEWORK !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Every day when i get out of my class on the Psalms , i am more and more reassured of the fact that God's divine wrath came against the Hebrew nation solely and completely in the form of the Hebrew Language . 
Hot shower on a cool day , life is good ! 
Having a brew then going to try and translate some Hebrew !!! 
A toll is a toll , and a roll is a roll . And if we don't get no tolls , then we don't eat no rolls .

Went to my first Hockey game tonight . It is quite possibly my new favorite thing . Blues win 1-0 in OT . Simply AWESOME !!! 
I so desperately want to be done with my Hebrew Exegetical paper , i really struggle to think of anything i dislike more than the Hebrew Language . oh well here begins a great debacle of a paper . 
On TV for the Husker Game today , i think i heard the band playing the tv theme song from \Coach . \ " AWESOME !!! " 
Officially done with all my work for LCMS History , that means i'm 1/4 through all of my classes . good times . 
1 Week ! 
Can\ 
honestly say that St < PROPFIRST > Drivers are by far the worst i have ever had \ 
to drive with . And yes , I've probably driven wherever you live , But St \ 
< PROPFIRST > ones are even worse than they are . 
Iowa state played a heck of a game , and i think has a great future . I was just happy to somehow squeak out a win , maybe next week we'll have a healthy complete team . 
Just watched the Minnesota State Screaming Eagles win the National Championship . Congrats to Coach < PROPMALE > Fox ... :) 
Exegetical Done ! 
no want mint for pillow need sleepy !!! 
Worst part of being back on campus ... \having to take keys with you to use the bathroom/shower so you don't get locked out of your room . \ " ( now that's living the high life ) " 
< PROPFIRST > Corso picked the Huskers to win today ... so now i'm mentally preparing for a loss . Thanks < PROPFIRST > . 
Great Weekend in spite of the Husker loss , and only two weeks till I'm back home in Detroit which irony of irony is actually a statistically safer city than St < PROPFIRST > . ( must be the better drivers ) 
Word of the day : Pleonasm\ 
The use of more words than those necessary to express an idea ; redundancy . ( never experienced here at the sem of course ) 
Thing most looked forward to on break : Not rest ( suprisingly ) not even family ( sorry guys ) i most look forward to driving around people who are not from Missouri . 
Finally felt well enough to get out of bed today for class , now if i could feel better enough to understand what Dr. Lessing was saying i'd be right as rain . 
There is the right way to do something , the wrong way , and the Lutheran way . \ 
Q . isn't the Lutheran way the right way ? \ 
A . Yes , but much slower . 
\the doctor says i wouldnt have so many nose bleeds if i kept my finger out of there \"" 
Hates the new profile 
< PROPMALE > , you were right . Going to the Zoo made me happy ! 
Just finished two big projects , now i get to start on two really big homework projects . Hooray !!! 
supposedly the worst storm in 30 years is on its way to St. < PROPFIRST > , maybe it'll cancel class and give me extra time for my Lessing exegetical ... knowing the sem probably not . 
they say that hiking is just walking where you can go pee , sometimes really young and really old people go hiking unintentionally ... 
is sad today , my fur hat i bought while in Russia split down the back . I guess 8 years is quite a long time to last but i lament its beginning to fall apart from usage . 
Black eyed peas ... i needed no more motivation than that to leave and go do homework . 
Cigar Club tonight we had Lutherans , Anglicans , and Catholics meeting for cigars , drinks , and ecumenical talks . It's pretty cool when you can get a systematics professor and the seminary president to show up for something like that , as well as an Anglican bishop . 
????????? ???????? ???????????? ???? ????? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ???????? 
writers of Hebrew Commentaries . I don't CARE if you find a chiasm in every verse , just tell me what the text means . 
First trip of the year to < PROPMALE > DREWS , mmmmmmmm ... 
Had a really nice weekend with < PROPFEMALE > , and got to see the Vienna Boy's choir , then when i get back to St < PROPFIRST > i hit a pot hole and ruin the front axle on my car ( i really love this city ) but on the plus side they put new shower heads in the dorm shower so now we have water pressure . hooray !!! 
Gave up facebook for Lent . See you all after Easter . 
At this point i don't care where i go for Vicarage as long as its off campus !!! 
I want to say Thank You to everyone i know who has served this country in the Armed Forces . God Bless you for your service ! 
I couldn't sleep at all last night ... It's my baby brothers birthday and i can't believe this will be his last year as a twenty-something-year-old . Happy Birthday Joosh !!! ITS YOUR DAY 
So I'm being sent to Bemidji Minnesota . I'm probably the only student at the Seminary who would actually be happy about that , so good for me i guess . After being in Russia , i figure Bemidji can't be so bad . 
Geeble Gobble !!! 
I truly love my fieldwork church ! Great sermon , great message by Pastor about current events in the world , and wonderfully kind reception for their fieldworkers all in one day . Thanks .
