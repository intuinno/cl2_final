Life is very challenging right now ... 
Bored on the couch .....

Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > at their work and < PROPFIRST > is threatening to charge me for using the internet and fax machine ... lol !!!!! 
Excited that the weekend is finally here ... YAY !!! 
Waiting for < PROPFIRST > to wake up so I have someone to play with ... lol !

Bored ... bored ... bored ... 
So glad the weekend is here ... finally get some family and friends time ! 
Does anyone have a cure for stress ? 
This baby can come out any day now ... I am so ready !!! 
People should be warned of what's to come during their last month's worth of doctors visits .... can we say painful !!! 
Went to the hospital today , thought I was in labor and turns out I am just sick and had a fever .... I hate waiting =( 
So now it's Monday afternoon and the water still isnt fixed , going on 2 days now and I can add possible kidney stones to the list .... this is not a good week so far ! 
Still hopeful that I go into labor this weekend ! LOL

Newborn = No sleep .... but she is definitley worth it ! 
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes yesterday =) 
Trying to relax and enjoy the day ... 
Making the most of every day from now on and learning not to take people or anything else for granted ... 
Everytime I see < PROPFEMALE > smile , it makes me feel all warm and squishy inside ! 
I'm pretty sure I broke my freakin ' toe today ............. so much for cleaning !

Went to take < PROPFEMALE > for a walk and its crazy < PROPFEMALE > outside !

More marriages might survive if the partners realized that sometimes the better comes after the worse . 
Everything has been said before , but since nobody listens we have to keep going back and beginning all over again . 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil , but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails . 1 Corinthians 13:4 
Love is blind -- marriage is the eye-opener ... 
Love - a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain , causes eyes to < PROPFEMALE > , cheeks to glow , blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker . 
< PROPFEMALE > went to get her first set of shots yesterday and was fine ..... until we got home ! 
Rain , rain go away ... because we have no power ! 
... Nevermind its fixed already ! 
So annoyed right now because I cant do an easy thing like open a stroller to take < PROPFEMALE > for a walk !!!!!! 
Been a busy and productive day so far .... and yes I was able to take < PROPFEMALE > for a walk because I got lessons on how to unlock the stroller from my hubby ! 
It's disappointing to know that your parents aren't good grandparents ... but its even worse when you knew it all along ... 
“We must all suffer one of two things : the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment . ” 
Sooo .. I lost my ring 2 days ago and you won't believe where I found it .... in the cheese .... don't ask ! LOL 
Yeah , I'm bored .... if you can't tell ! 
Hopefully today will be more interesting then yesterday .... 
Semi-productive today ... but missing my better half =( 
.. Ok so now I lost my car keys .... whats next , my mind ??? 
Soooo ..... I'm not losing my mind because it took 5 days to figure out that < PROPFIRST > accidentally took my keys instead of his when he took his truck to the shop to get fixed ! 
.................................................................................................................................................................... 
I have a new philosophy . I'm only going to dread one day at a time . 
Love : A temporary insanity curable by marriage . 
At home sick .....

What would you do if your parents did not like your husband ? \ 
a . ) Cut them off from your family for good . \ 
b . ) Just wait until they decide to come around . ( which may be never)\ 
c . ) Give up . \ 
d . ) Do nothing and hope for the best . 
The cat and I are both shedding . Fortunately for him , his is a seasonal coat ... I have to worry if mine will grow back at all !!!

I suffer from shor t-t erm memory loss . It's true ! I forget things almost instantly . It runs in my family ! Well I mean ... at least ... I think it does . Hum ... Where are they ? ... Can I help you ? - Dory 
Woman are meant to be loved , not to be understood . 
My heart smiled when you kissed my lips . What a sweet surprise . 
... Is blessed to have awesome family and friends ...

To make a long story short , don't tell it . 
Need some good luck ... and fast ! 
Its going to be a busy weekend ... but a good one ! 
Ok forget good luck ... how about a miracle ? 
Wish me luck ! A miracle may happen tomorrow !!!!!!!! 
So much for miracles ... hard to believe in anything anymore ... 
Vaccum in one hand and baby in the other ... you think I would be somewhat buff by now ! 
Its amazing what one's influence can have on another family member and how it can affect so many people . Yet there is always hope that one day the other person will come around as well .... at least I hope she will ... 
Today is my stepdaughter's 6th birthday ! Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > , love you !!! 
Its gonna be a good day today ! 
If you say your gonna call , call . If you make plans with someone , follow thru . I hate it when people decide to do something else and don't call to let you know . Friends don't get mad or hold it against you if you cancel , they understand . It just pisses me off when people do this ... just sayin .... 
HAPPY FRIDAY EVERYONE !!!! 
Paintball tomorrow .... YAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
No paintball today .... BOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
