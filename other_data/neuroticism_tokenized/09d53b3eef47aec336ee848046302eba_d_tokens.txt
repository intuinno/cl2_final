is glad to be home ! 

just got a macbook pro ! 
Is not sure she likes her < PROPMALE > - too many system problems ! Thought they were supposed to be better than PCs !!!!!!! 
is home !!!!!! 
is thankful for good friends . 
is glad her sister enjoys the finer things in life with her , such as : The Misadventures of Flapjack , bathtub crayons , and The Wiggles live in concert . 
wishes that if her neighbors insisted on listening to their music at unhealthy volumes they would at least have good taste in music ! 
gets to go to a Seattle Mariners Game tomorrow and sit in the President's Suite ! Only thing that could make it better was if she had remembered to pack her camera ! 
I guess you know your fruit Popsicle is really made from fruit when there are not only chunks of fruit , in this case strawberries , but also some leaves !!! 
Is it stupid that I'm super excited for my neurology appointment simply because the doctor's name is Dr. House ? 
Well , 45 minutes , three different beverages , several different google searches , and too many strategies to count later , I think I may be able to swallow my diuretic pill tomorrow ! Who would have thought that carbonation would help . Now , we need to pray that it happens when I need it too , not just when I practice with pieces of marshmallow ! Why am I 24 and still not able to swallow pills like every other human ???!! 
had a staring contest with a hawk today . It might have been the highlight of my week :) 
Okay , this one sounds fun . I want all my facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me . But , I want you to lie . That's right . Just make stuff up . And get creative ! After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same .
