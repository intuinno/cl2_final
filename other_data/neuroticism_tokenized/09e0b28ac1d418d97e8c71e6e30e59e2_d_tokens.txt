“I’m not a prophet , but I’m here to profit . That’s all . I’m gone . That’s my life . Nothing is sacred . I don’t fall in love , I just fake it . I don’t fall in love , I don’t fall in love . ” ~ Fun ~ Best lyric i have ever heard ... haha

Then through your life you meet a few People who aren't any of the above at all . Its these people that help you realize ... \ 
The world ain't half bad .

I think in relationships , you find out just as much about the other person as much as urself . You find the person they portray , the person they hide , the person they wish to be , \ 
its like falling in love 3 different times ... relationships are hard but it also comes with things to grow from and to realize ... they were all you needed all along . \ 
The Spaces between your fingers were made for someone else to fill them in . 
ugh ... nyquil isnt working 
Life's a strange thing . It's like walking down the street and you pass shops and people . You never really forget people . The hot dog fender smiles and they have a laugh that sounds familiar . Their a stranger and an old friend all at the same time . at least i hope . i hope she remembers me , even if its something she'll never remember . 
i think in the end .... i finally grew up 
rather fail as myself then make it as someone i'm not 
Rest in peace phone
