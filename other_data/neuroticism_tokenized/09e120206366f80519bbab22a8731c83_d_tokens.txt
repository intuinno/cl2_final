\Everything happens for a reason\ " is no reason not to ask yourself if you're living it right . " 
When the spring is cold , where do robins go ? What makes winters lonely ? Now at last , I know .. 
Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times , when one only remembers to turn on the light .

Everyone's going to say ass tomorrow .

I hope that womb's not too warm , cause it's cold out here . And it will be quite a shock to breathe this air , to discover loss . I'd like to make some changes before you arrive . So when your new eyes meet mine , they won't see no lies , just love . 
<3 ' s snl's latest idiot who said fuckin instead of freakin . =D let's see if she's on next week .. hahahahah oh man . GOODNIGHT ! 
... Where are you , Arienette ? 
And at least I exist . What could mean more than this ? 
Oh , what can you do with a sentimental heart ? 
Are you a Kiwani ? Are those expensive ? How do you afford it ? 
There's a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall and the bells in the steeple too . And up in the nursery , an absurd little bird is popping out to say coo coo . 
new cameras are fun . 
THE OFFICE . < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > <3 =] 
Friday night arrives without a suitcase . 
Sunday morning creeping like a nun

i've been eating for you . 
Just say the word and of course , I'll stay . Roll your eyes , and I'll go awawy . Just , please don't leave me guessing . Just please , don't keep me waiting . 
life's a slippery slope , regret is the steepest hill . hope for the best , plan for the worst & maybe wind up somewhere in the middle . 
bring out the < PROPFEMALE > nash and led zeppelin . dance parteh time !! 
I got the money if you got the time , ____ . 
Thanks for overcharging me , Verizon . 
Instead of telling our young people to plan ahead , we should tell them to plan to be surprised . 
Maybe it's me who's this unstable , always obsessed about the end . Why can't I let what happens happen and just enjoy the time I spend ? 
It's not something I would recommend , but it is one way to live .. 
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand ? 
food pantry tonight . wootage . 
Let's just keep touching . Let's just keep , keep singing . 
Oh my darling , when you smile , it is like a song . & I can hear it now .

And now for < PROPFIRST > Poppins . Go , < PROPFEMALE > Andrews , go ! 
Make a plan to love me .. sometime soon . 
All we ever do is .. say goodbye . 
When the Lord closes a door , somewhere He opens a window . 
Somewhere out there is a lady who I think will never be a nun . Auf Wiedersehen , darling . 
Well , apparently , we're both suffering from a deplorable lack of curiosity . 
Where , oh where , has my baby been ? 
So imagine what you want , and then hold on to that thought . Cause that's as close as it will ever come . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > Lennon . 
We might die from medication , but we sure killed all the pain . 
ACT tomorrow :S :S :S 
Why must it be Sunday ? 
Who needs anti depressants when you have Addehs , Kikkis , and snuggies ? 
research papers arent my cuppa tea .. 
quietly turning the back door key , stepping outside she is free . 
Morning breaks and the sun warms my face , how I wish it were you warming me . 
As she posts another letter to the sound of five , people gather round her , and she finds it hard to stay alive . It’s just another day . 
Mahk Hahmon . 
f.m.l. 
It's too cold to take pictures :( 
i miss my bangs .. 
You're far away . Where are you ?..... In a world that's disappearing , I'm afraid . 
The Beatles/AP European History Party . 
I don't get good feelings there at all . And i can feel them around me . I can feel , I can definitely hear them . I can see them , through the window .. constantly there : morning , noon , and night . And you have no idea how they have tried to debate that because there are a lot of people that do not believe . 
I'm not carefree , no . I'm free to care , I just never do . 
All I need is a mirror to go with this fever . 
oooohhhhh myyy gawwwwwddddduh 
Me eat pancake before pancake happy hour on ______ . 
I love how I still can't sign up for Advanced Photography <3 
The < PROPMALE > Trapp children don't play . They march . 
The best way to get over a woman is to turn her into literature . 
I saw it glitter as I grew and loved a boy I never knew . I thought this place was heaven-sent , but now it's just a monument . 
I hate Verizon . 
Is this the end or just the start of something really really beautiful wrapped up and disguised as something really really ugly ? 
Is there any way I can block become a fan crap from my news feed ? 
So I guess I have a tumblr now . http://turrillkelly.tumblr.com/ 
I love LA . 
The saddest part of a broken heart isn't the ending so much as the start . The tragedy starts from the very first spark , losing your mind for the sake of your heart . 
Verizon getting sued for false charges <3 http://www.electronista.com/articles/10/02/26/verizon.said.charging.2.dollars.for.unused.data/ 
Use dementors to get rid of teh lazys . 
I can't seem to stop singing wherever I am . And what's worse , I can't seem to stop saying things - anything and everything I think and feel . 
& the pride inside their eyes is synchronized to a love you'll never know , so much more than you can show 
< PROPFEMALE > , my < PROPFEMALE > . These are words that go together well , my < PROPFEMALE > . 
Block .. 
< PROPFIRST > Mayer at Nationwide Arena tonight :D 
You brought music back into the house . I had forgotten . 
And we'll go dancing , baby . Then you'll see how the magic's in the music and the music's in me 
What can I do to you , I'm only a shadow .

The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love . Let the < PROPFEMALE > clouds < PROPMALE > everyone from this place . Come on with the rain . 
Oh look , It's < PROPFIRST > from Facebook . 
“That's amazing , < PROPFIRST > , but I'm gonna go home now and look at my vagina with a hand-mirror . \ I love < PROPFEMALE > Fey . " 
Someone's churning the earth . Someone's stirring the sky . 
The sweetest woman in the world could be the meanest woman in the world if you make her that way . You keep hurting her , she'll keep being quiet . She might be holding something inside that will really really hurt you one day . 
When we left the movie show , the future wasn't bright . But came the < PROPFEMALE > , the show goes on , and I don't wanna say goodnight . 
I forgot the other boy .. What was his name ?.. Oh well , God bless what's his name . 
project runway <3 
Dignity , always dignity . 
There's stars in my eyes and there's sun in my hair . & I'm running away , it makes me feel better . 
Lie to me if you will at the top of Beringer Hill . Tell me anything you want , any old lie will do . Call me back to you . 
~ I'm sitting on the edge of my bathtub talking to addehieeahfda samson reese on my laptop and I can see the reflection of the lappoop . XD ~ ~ xd *~~ XD ~ xD 
School is ass . 
Lush red feature counter top with crushed quartz .... it's too red ! 
Why does my heart go on beating ? Why do these eyes of mine cry ? Don't they know it's the end of the world ? Afterall , it ended when you said goodbye .. 
Happy quit facebook day . 
at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ' s house . makin cookiessss . 
Such a long Sunday drive .. and I'm taking it all alone 
Crimson and clover , over and over . 
Sometimes lonely isn't sad . 
What's going to happen's going to happen . Just make sure it doesn't happen to you . 
typing on the wii is fun ., 
time for living life on the D-List :) 
She's a < PROPFEMALE > of a girl , I guess that's what you might say . 
Do you want a relationship with me ? 
I'm your equal . I'm going to meet you men on your own terms , cater to your craving for efficiency , learn to talk sports , tell jokes , smoke , drink , and yes , if I have to , I'll even kiss you back ! 
I may not be as clever as you , but I haven't been an actress for nothing ! I know an awful lot about life and men than most people , and I know the only things that matter are understanding and happiness and being absolutely genuine all the bloody time . 
I never read < PROPMALE > Sawyer . Was he ... sexy ? He was only twelve ! So ? If ya got it , ya got it . 
I , liking buffalos , fell through a black hole inside of a trapdoor , and get ready , for a good picture . Please , don't say anything racist , that you might need to feel remorse for , later . 
I wanna be your happiness . I wanna be your common sense pain . Wrap your head in a picket fence , we'll build after the hurricane . 
Don't show me how profitable it will be to fall in love with you , < PROPFIRST > . Don't Americanize me . 
I don't want to know what's good , or bad , or true . I let God worry about the truth . I just want to know the momentary fact about things . Life isn't good , or bad , or true . It's merely factual , it's sensual , it's alive . My idea of living sensual facts are you , a home , a country , a world , a universe . In that order . I want to know what I am , not what I should be . 
Insects flutter up against my window . I don't like the way they look at me . 
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like \I love you \"." 
Whistles , orders . No more music , no more laughing . Nothing that reminds him of her . Even the children . 
Unfortunately , my darling , you can't take a whole audience home to bed without being accused of immorality on rather a grand scale . 
I'm just reminiscing on something I've already seen . 
You mean nothing to no one , but that's nobody's fault . 
Why does the thunder get so angry ? It makes me want to cry . :( 
Fuck thematics and fuck it hard . 
Through cowardice , we shall all be saved . 
Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke , in this ' ole wide world there's no happier bloke . 
You've got to admit , seduction can really be very funny if you stop and think about it . ... You're not supposed to stop and think about it . 
Cut your hair . Let them see how truly abandoned you are . 
He loved my sinuses and spleen and every organ in between . Yet he never said he loved me . 
You'll never decide what you want until you've decided who you are . 
Always remember there was nothing worth sharing like the love that let us share our name 
One bottle of booze and it's all hearts and flowers again . Fat lot he cares if his little girl's got a job . 
How about I send you a book on nutrition ? Then you can stop spoonfeeding me non-fiction . 
Poor broken < PROPFEMALE > and nobody's child . Haunting and taunting , you're \ 
just kind of wild . 
There was talk of love and how I need it back . 
It's nothing but time and a face that you lose . I chose to feel it , and you couldn't choose . 
I'm < PROPFIRST > , and I'm going to be eighteen on Friday , and I'd \ 
like a pink parasol . 
Sometimes I cry myself to sleep because I'm not < PROPFEMALE > Andrews . 
God's will hath no why . 
Don't tell me not to live , just sit and putter . Life's < PROPFEMALE > and the sun's a ball of butter . 
I know not who I am . 
Live through this , and you won't look back . 
Such proper language for acts so cruel . 
History bows and it steps aside . In the jungle there's columns of purple light . We're starting over . 
How sad it is to know I'm in control .
