She crushed all my hopes and dreams . Told me I was amazing then within one day decides to move in with her exboyfriend and I find out her web of lies . Now I'm tangled up . Thought she was in love with me . That's bullcrap lies . I'm imploding right now . Her love for Me was driven by prestidigitation . She had so much potential . And she couldn't break up with me to my face ....... even text !!!! I had to learn from her family !

Got a visit from < PROPFIRST > Deininger tonight , Miss working with that guy . Always has some kind of story to tell . Should go Hangout at his impressive cabin sometime . He still has yet to implement that hot tub we discussed though , Chess and some beer will suffice . As long as he doesn't have his friend try and teach me calculus though . \

One bright day in the middle of the night , \ 
Two dead men got up to fight . \ 
Back-to-back they faced one another , \ 
< PROPFIRST > their swords and shot each other . \ 
One was blind and the other couldn't see , \ 
So they chose a dummy for a referee . \ 
A blind man went to see fair play , \ 
A dumb man went to shout \hooray ! \ " \ 
Never interrupt your opponent while he’s making a mistake . 
I love you today . But it is only continuation of the love I felt for you yesterday and the love I will feel for you through all tomorrows . 
Sleeeepppp

Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Went with < PROPMALE > to Las Vegas skill games we both won 60 bucks within 15 minutes got triple 7s . Walked out with 15 more than I came with < PROPMALE > 25 . 
Some ass in a big truck with cab lights rode on my bumper all the way home .

The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time , and still retain the ability to function . One should , for example , be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise . ~ F . < PROPFIRST > Fitzgerald 
Boldness is ever blind , for it sees not dangers and inconveniences whence it is bad in council though good in execution . ~ Francis Bacon
