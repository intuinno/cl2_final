Hey , hey , hey . Guess what , guess what , guess what . I GOT PUBLISHED !!! 

Hey < PROPFIRST > , I got a question for you . You were born on April 1st . So , does that mean you were born a fool ? 
I just realized something . Somehow , someway the inconcievable did occur . I grew up and matured . 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I\ 
know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my\ 
friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least\ 
for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still\ 
... fighting it .. 
I just realized that in a little over a week and a half , I'll be free from school , have no schedule to follow , and have almost no responsibilities for three months . .... FML !! 
Agenda for next week : Finals , finals , glider flight contest after Military History final , more finals , Honors Day presentation/competition . And then top it off with finding a nice ditch to die peacefully of exhaustion in . 
Just realized I have a margin of error of 7 out of 50 questions on my US Military History Final tomorrow to maintain my B , and need a high A on the < PROPMALE > of Religion Final as well . Why do I feel that I'm gonna pull an all-nighter tonight studying for the finals I have tomorrow ? FML 
WOO HOO ! Just 13 hours to go till Bohemian Circus . I can taunt the kids as they try to dunk me ! REVENGE ON THE BRATS FROM HELL !!! MWA HA HA HA ! 
If time destroys all things , and we choose to waste time , is that not just a very slow form of suicide ? 
You and I wake up in a police car together . Using FOUR words only , what would you say to me ? NOTE : If you comment you must copy and paste to your status so I can comment on yours . 
Stupid cancer ... we all wish to have a new car ... new phone ... to lose weight ... a person who has cancer only wants one thing ... to fight their cancer ... i know that 97% of you won't put this on your wall ... but 3% of my friends will .... Put it on your wall in honor of someone who died from cancer or who's fighting against it now ... 
\Ah

The first day was a rockin ' success ! I can't wait to see how the rest of the week goes ! 
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT . The DARK SIDE has stopped carrying Cookies . We have found that it brings too many incompetents over to our side and is causing early onset Diabetes for our officers . We now offer FREE YOGURT and BANANAS to those who decide to join us . THANK YOU . THAT IS ALL . 
Recipe of ' The Good Life ' : 1 1/2 cups of love , 1 cup of dedication and loyalty , 1/2 cup of planning , a dash of spontaneity , a pinch of misery for flavor , and MOST important ... hmmm what was that last bit ? Oh yeah ! LIVE IT UP ! ( Duh ! )

Kids with Special needs aren't weird or odd . They only want what everyone wants .. to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for 1 hour ? It is Special Education week & Autism Awareness month , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you are faced with it 
Friends are those who you would die for with a smile on your face , if it meant knowing they would live on happily . 
Why is it the older you get , the more Friday starts to feel like Monday ?

— Immanuel Kant 
It doesn't matter what the class , always somewhere in the course they should tell you the words of the wise Socrates : \The unexamined life is not worth living . \ " Because none should forget that to live is never enough . One must live and LEARN of life . " 
There are fewer convictions that are stronger than those made with the heart . Fewer still than those made by a heart in love . 
Never snuck out\ 
Never had sex\ 
Never skipped class\ 
Never smoked\ 
Never drank\ 
... Never broke the law\ 
Put this as you status , and whoever likes it thinks your lying\

Seriously ? Am I really the only Lone < PROPFEMALE > student interested in attending TEDxTheWoodlands on Sat , Sept 24 ?

There are 19 seats left for TEDxTheWoodlands . anyone from church should know our own < PROPFIRST > Loumis-Price is a speaker . And freinds should note it's a great opportunity and should be very interesting . It could also be a great way to network and make new friends . 
If I had the choice , I'd go to hell . Heaven has the better company , but I imagine Hell has better conversation .
