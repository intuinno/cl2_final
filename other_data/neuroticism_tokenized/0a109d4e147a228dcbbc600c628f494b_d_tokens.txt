Pick for today ; The old man , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 
While ur screaming at ur woman , there is a man who wishes he could whisper in her ear . While u humiliate , offend , & insult her , there is a man flirting with her & reminding her how beautiful she is . While u hurt her , there is a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there is a man stealing smiles from her ... Repost this if you are against domestic violence 
ever get that weird feelin ' that the next few weeks could be very important to your future ..... or somoene elses future for that matter ? I keep getin that weird fellin ' , and i'm not sure i like it ................ 
Well , if the computer was working 4 hours ago i would have picked < PROPFIRST > Jr. to win at Martinsville .... not a bad choice :) 2nd is great .
