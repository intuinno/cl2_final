I like it on the floor or the table 
carried a child within my body . I've comforted a baby on my chest . I have kissed and hugged , been vomited on , peed on , pooped on , awakened inthe middle of the night to a feverish child & more . I wouldn't haveit any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a Mom , and there is no greater honor or blessing . Make this your status if you're proud to be a mommy ? 
My kids are playing peek-a-boo with eachother but instead of saying peek-a-boo when they uncover thier eyes they are screaming and then laughing hysteric 
ally ...

Finally done with my laundry , ran some errands today , cleaned up all the toys and now just sitting here listening to music relaxing :-) 
More snow is coming ... I am so ready for it to be warm and green again !!!!

DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN . ( 1 ) FINE - this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are RIGHT & YOU need to SHUT UP . ( 2 ) NOTHING - means SOMETHING & u need to be WORRIED . ( 3 ) GO AHEAD - this is a dare not permission , DO NOT DO IT . ( 4 ) WHATEVER - is a woman's way of saying F**K YOU . ( 5 ) THAT'S OK - she is thinking long & hard on HOW & WHEN you will pay for your mistake . Re-post if u agree 
Is in need of a mental health day ... away from the kids ... The kids need a day away from each other as well !! 
From A to Z use a word to describe me . lets try and use all the letter and try our best to stay in order ! ( : post this as your status to see what you get (:
