\My curse is to always be behind . No matter what I do I just cannot seem to get ahead . Life for me is moving slower with each passing day . My friends are well in front of me and the harder I try to catch up the greater the distance grows between us . It se " 
Its been a long long time coming but its time for me to go . 
Bed then up to work at 430 . IHML

So when Professor O'Cools has trivia night remember that \General Knowledge\ " questions are \ " generally\ " NOT \ " known\ " by the \ " general\ " public . Friggin ECU professors ... like a team of supercomputers ... i hate them " 
Already writing a paper . What the heck man . 
Finshed a paper , time to sleep . 
Sweet talking an old lady so that she will give me UNC basketball tickets right behind the players . 
If failing to plan is planning to fail then doesn't that mean you achieved your goal ? Think about it . 
Home for a sec then back to class 
Anthropology homework . Shoot me in the face .

Well football is off to a terrific start . ( Delhomme sucks ) Looking foward to Late Night with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > at the < PROPFIRST > Dome now . 
\If I could only be free from the torment you put me through . \ " HJ " 
Confused and troubled ... 
Going to bed and dreaming of the massive amounts of money that will be deposited into my checking account sometime between one and two :) 
Watching the Yankees . Maybe they won't blow the lead tonite . 
Hurt my thumb :( 
Well < PROPFIRST > I think its already time to get someone up in the bullpen . Bottom of the first and looking like a blowout . 
Are you kidding me the yankees should start every game down four runs . Its the only way any other team has a < PROPMALE > . 
So i deff was the only student to show up for my study group tonite . Hope the < PROPFEMALE > tells my professor and just gives me a freakin A . PLEASE !!! please ... please ??? 
Trying to watch football , basketball , baseball , and study . Should be interesting . 
It hurts that I can do nothing ... 
Watching the Tar Heels then the Colts . 
getting ready for the game tonite 
Who dat ... who dat say dey gonna beat dem Saints ? 
life has me down 
Can't believe im pulling for Dook but I hate those cocky Big Ten punks 
The Dookies let me down !!! WHAT THE HECK ??? 10 years without a loss in this challenge and they lose to the Badgers ? Nature's pissed off retarded bear cousin ? All you Dookies should burn your team apparel and just cry yourselves to sleep . UNC had a bunch of rookies and handed it to last year's runner up team . I'm ashamed to even pull for a team that is in the same conference as Dook . DOOK SUCKS !!!! 
Wish I could just disappear ... 
If I could leave this place today I'd be gone without ever looking back . 
I don't care what you might think about me , you'll get by without me if you want . I could be the one to take you home . Baby we could rock the night alone and we never get down it wouldn't be the let down , but sugar don't forget what you already know . I could be the one to turn you out . We could be the talk across the town . Don't judge it by the color , confuse it for another or You might regret what you let slip away . 
The one good thing that comes from the Panthers not having a quarterback is that the Vikings have a better < PROPMALE > of winning . Go Favre !!! 
All you need is love . 
Haha . < PROPMALE > Delhomo pack your bags . < PROPMALE > Moore is taking your spot !!! 
Hey , thanks for being the worst kind of person . 
Feeling pretty good today ... 
what a crappy day for football the panthers were the only bright spot and i feel sure the vikings wil lose tomorrow ...

At least the Tar Heels won tonite . #2 seed in the NFC is still up for grabs . Way to blow the game Peterson ... 
Looking at lab pups tomorrow then getting my stuff together for the Columbia trip .

Man , I really miss my iPod :( 
UNC with a win streak :) 
Who says you gotta be old to miss the good ol days ? 
Friggin bump on my eyelid is killing me !!! 
Watching basketball and reading Rush's broadcast for today .

Bed somewhat early . Church in the morning then fishing until work . 
Facebook continues to thank me for getting many of my friends to join . How bout send me on a vacation to show your thanks facebook instead of just writing me a little note . 
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself to hold on to these moments as they pass ... 
Ready for the game tonite . Haven't punched the door in awhile hopefully won't have to tonite either . 
GO HEELS !!! 
Getting ready for work ... what a bore it shall be :( 
Working then taking the dogs to the creek to throw the dummy . 
Beer , pizza , and my UNC Tar Heels !!! What more could I possibly need ? 
Nothing better than the smell of fresh cut grass > 
Sometimes , when one person is missing , the whole world seems depopulated . ~ Lamartine . Just finished breaking my hand , trying to take the edge off . 
I'm tired of screwin ' up , tired of goin ' down , tired of myself , tired of this town ... Buy me a drink , sing me a song , take me as I come ' cause I can't stay long ... 
I want you to want ... me - CT

\Thou < PROPMALE > to me a delicious torment . \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > "

\Everyone has flaws . Its just a matter of finding someone who appreciates those flaws and loves you for them . \ " - MS :) " 
Its not who you are underneath , but what you do that defines you . 
I may not be here when you call , so , best be giving your all . 
I've always wondered if my life would have been better if I hadnt met you , but then I think of what my life would have been like if I hadnt . 
We are all puppets , I'm just the puppet that can see the strings ... 
Can I have just one more moonlight dance with you my love ? 
I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself ... a bird will fall frozen dead from a limb without ever feeling sorry for itself . 
Crazy Crazy Crazy . Soooo glad I made it home ok . 
summertime means popcicles by the ton :) 
getting some stuff packed and getting ready 
I pray that this broken road will lead to you . 
Every little thing is going to be alright . 
Just the thought of you can drive me wild , oh you make me smile . 
laying ... trying not to make my sunburn angry ... 
I give up . 
Hope is nothing but an illusion . 
I got nothing 
Out 
If only wishes came true ... 
I'm rolling thunder and falling rain . 
I may not be here when you call ... 
Ridiculous 
If I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck at all . 
So here's your holiday . Hope you enjoy it this time . 
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's ... his hair was perfect . 
After eating an entire bull , a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring . He kept it up until a < PROPMALE > came along and shot him . The moral : When you're full of bull , keep your mouth shut .

I think the door just dislocated my pinky ... 
Can't seem to do anything right . 
\I ain't ever had a lucky break . \ " HG " 
Get busy living or get busy dying . 
You never lose by loving . You always lose by holding back . 
One day at a time -- this is enough . Do not look back and grieve over the past for it is gone ; and do not be troubled about the future , for it has not yet come . Live in the present , and make it so beautiful it will be worth remembering . 
Tonite , bourbon is my only friend ; I shall cradle this bottle until it rocks me to sleep . 
Dear Dad , \ 
\ 
Thanks for being the best father anyone could ever hope to have , for always being there with a solution for all my problems , for all the fishing trips and for showing me how every man ought to act . I hope one day to be half the man you are and I will be lucky if I turn out to be one fourth the father you have been to me . Thanks again for everything you do and have a great Father's day . \ 
Love , Your Son 
\Stop following your passion ... start carrying your passion with you . \""
