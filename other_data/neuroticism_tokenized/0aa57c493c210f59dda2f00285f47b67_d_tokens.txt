I am a ladybug , torn from my winter rug , with nobody to keep me warm . So I went out into the storm , found that I had been reborn , and spring came anyway . 
Held under these smothering waves by your strong and thick veined hand , but one of these days I'm going to wriggle up onto dry land . 
I'm wide awake , its morning . 
I won't say I'll never love , but I don't say a lot of things , and you my love , are gone . So fly away on soapy heels , and promise not to promise anymore . And if you come around again , then I will take the chain off of the door . 
I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust . 
Exit the capsule , the lights off in the < PROPFEMALE > houses back on planet Earth . So this is outer space .

It is easy to be beautiful ; it is difficult to appear so . I admire you for the trap you've set . It's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over . 
I want to be with you all of the time ; Its useless , but I have to try . 
But where was it when I first heard the sweet sound of humility ? It came to my ears in the goddamn loveliest < PROPFEMALE > . How grateful I am now to be part of the mystery , to love and to be loved . Let's just hope that is enough . 
Brunch with VP Biden ? Just gotta get a good word in for my letter of recommendation to the Academy and get out hahaha (: 
Now that its spring , we'll sleep out in the garden . And if it rains , we'll just sink in to the mud , where it is quiet and much cooler than the house is , and there is no clocks or phones to wake us up . Because I have learned that nothing is as pressing as the one who is pressing would like you to believe ; And I'm content to walk a little slower because there is nowhere that I really need to be . <3

So I don't listen to the boys who say that you're bad for me and I should turn you away . I get a feeling when I look at you . Wherever you go now , I wanna be there too . They say we're crazy , but I just don't care , and if they keep on talking , still they'll get nowhere . So I don't mind if they don't understand , when I look at you and you hold my hand . Cause they don't know about us , they've never heard of love . <3 
Dear Johns Hopkins University , Please do not taunt me with emails about your beautiful undergrad admissions programs unless those emails are accompanied by scholarships . Its just not nice . 
sucks at life . 
Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart , like why are we here ? And where do we go ? And how come it's so hard ? It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving but I'll tell you one thing , it's always better when we're together . ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Butler call me or I'm not coming over .

Dear Americans : Obviously building a mosque blocks away from the site of the WTC is much more offensive to the \sacred ground\ " than having a Burlington Coat Factory on the exact same spot .
