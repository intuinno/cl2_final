it no matter what . You have my full honesty . I dare you to put this in\ 
your status and see what people ask you ! \ " , 201 0-0 9-03 02:49:49 " 
Tell me - did you sail across the sun ? Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded ? And that heaven is overrated ? Tell me - did you fall for a shooting < PROPFEMALE > ? One without a perminant scar ? And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there ?

I just want to be happy . 
today is gonna be the day when they throw it all back to you\ 
and by now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do\ 
and I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now 
I have seen at least three or four posts of people saying \I like it on the bed/desk/in the closet/on the floor/ect .. \ " Would someone please tell me what this is a reference to ? I'm so confused . " 
I like it on the chair by the kitchen table . 
A tired song is playing on a tired Radio , and I won't tell no one your name .... Now we're grown up orphans who never knew our names , and we won't tell no one that's a shame ... Don't it make you sad to know that life , is more than who we are ? 
I just found out it would be < PROPFIRST > Lennon's birthday if he was alive ! <3

1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and so much else , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this 
mahhhh 
This is cancer awareness month . In memory of every cancer patient , family member , and friend who has lost their battle with cancer ? and in honor of those who continue to conquer ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy & paste . I was proud to . Will you ? 
Black birds singing in the dead of night , take these broken wings and learn to fly \ 
all your life , you were only waiting for this moment to arise 
Loving is what I got . I said remember that . <3 
Life is like a watermelon , eat it and it bleeds , eat it and it bleeds , eat it and it bleeds ... lol , i just randomly remembered this . < PROPFIRST > Hathaway 
Tomorrow , Oct . 20 , 2010 , I will be wearing purple in rememberance of the teens who took their lives due to intolerance and bullying over their sexuality . Purple represents Spirit on the LGBTQ flag . You don't have to be lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgendered , or even questioning your sexuality ; wear purple in support of those who are . On Oct . 20th help raise awareness of this serious issue ! 
chillin and listening to Metrostation <3 
Of\ 
every 10 people born 1 is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is \ 
instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority and \ 
much more , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens commit \ 
suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste \ 
this . Many of you won't , but let's see who will . 
doing homework and stuff , then going over to < PROPMALE>'s later :) 
Stop and stare . I think I'm moving but I go nowhere . Yeah , I know that everyone gets scared . But I've become what I can't be , oh . \ 
Stop and stare . You start to wonder why you're here not there . And you'd give anything to get what's fair . But fair ain't what you really need . Oh , can you see what I see ? 
What do you do when your life's a disaster , and time's moving faster , and it's getting harder to breath ? What do you say when someone is right but , you disagree , even if it's the tru-uuth ? 
BROTHER WEEK . If you have a brother who has made you laugh , tortured you , stuck-up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watch you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , & you cant do without , copy and paste this to your wall . \ 
<3 < PROPMALE > 
and I don't want the world to see me ( but I do ... )\ 
because I don't think that they'd understand ( I wish they would ... )\ 
When everything's meant to be broken ( and it is ... )\ 
I just want you to know who I am ( I want to know who you are , too ) 
the < PROPFEMALE > is breaking , and it's no surprise , the landscape looks like nothing I've ever dreamed ,... the air is clearing , and it's becoming increasingly obvious , that i never belonged here , anyways 
Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was killed in Hogwarts when it was under siege by the Death Eaters during The Second Wizarding War . The Order brings unity , but the Death Eaters continue to < PROPMALE > division and hatred . 57 citizens died in the ... terrorist attack against Hogwarts . 93% of people won't repost this . Repost to show your support of Dumbledore's Army . 
Thank you everyone for all the wonderful birthday wishes !!! <3 
The < PROPFEMALE > is breaking , the light shinning through . I'm barely waking , and I'm tangled up in you . \ 
Even the best fall down sometimes . Even the wrong words seem to rhyme . Out of the doubt that fills my mind , I finely find , you and I collide . 
is spending the afternoon in Boston with the fam , plus meeting my aunt < PROPFEMALE > there . ? 
Keep drinking coffee , stare me down across the table\ 
While I look outside\ 
So many things I'd say if only I were able\ 
But I just keep quite and count the cars that pass by .... \ 
\ 
So let me thank you for your time\ 
And try not to waste any more of mine\ 
Get out of here fast\ 
I hate to break it to you babe\ 
But I'm not drowning .... \ 
You've got the talking down\ 
Just not the listening . 
No school tomorrow !!!!!! :) Anyone wanna make plans ?? If so comment , message me , or text . Just contact me somehow . :) 
wants to know why my dog < PROPFEMALE > insists on eating things that aren't edible , such as pieces of rope . Why , < PROPFEMALE > ? Why ? You'd think by now she'd realize eating rope makes her throw up , but nooooo , she likes it because it's chewy .... * eye roll * 
A\ 
true friend doesn't care when you're broke , if your being a bitch , what\ 
you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or\ 
if your family is filled with crazy people . They love you for who you \ 
are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . :) ? 
is an official staff member at Camp Grossman for the summer of 2011 !!! :) :) 
whats worse than annoying Christmas music ... Taylor Swift Christmas music ! :/ 
Got a letter from Camp Grossman =) 
And all of our parents , they're getting older . I wonder if they've \ 
wished for anything better , while in their memories , < PROPFEMALE > \ 
tragedies .... They love to tell you stay inside the lines . Well \ 
something's better on the other side .... I wanna run through the halls of\ 
my high school . I wanna scream at the \ 
top of my lungs . I just found out there's no such thing as the real \ 
world , just a lie you've got to overcome . 
I worry , I weigh 3 times my body , throw my fears around . But this morning , theres a calm I cant explain . The rock < PROPFEMALE>'s melted , only diamonds now remain ... By the time I recognize this moment , this moment will be gone . But I will bend the light , pretend that it somehow lingers on . And I will wait to find if this will last foreverAnd I will pay no mindWhen it wont and it wont because it cant it just cant . Its not supposed 2

Don't waste your time , no friend of mine , untill you love me just the way I am . <3 A good song . 
Little Lion Man .... And it was not your fault but mine . And it was your heart on the line . I really fucked it up this time , didn't I my dear ? 
Type your name : < PROPFEMALE > Geiger\ 
With your elbow : < PROPFEMALE > Gdekigedr\ 
With your nose : < PROPFEMALE > giger\ 
With your eyes closed : Ravhel Geiger\ 
Put this as your status : Don't erase your mistakes . 
Let me take you down , cause I'm going to strawberry fields . Nothing is real , and nothing to get < PROPMALE > about-strawberry fields forever . Living is easy with eyes closed , misunderstanding all you see . It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out , it doesn't matter much to me . 
I'm gonna go out foraging\ 
When i come back , I'll show you what I've seen\ 
I just know we can't stay here\ 
The cobwebs are getting everywhere . 
This world will never be what I expected , and if I don't belong , who would've guessed it ? I will not leave alone everything that I own , to make you feel like it's not too late , it's never too late . <3 
No , facebook , I do not want to try the new profile , so stop trying to introduce me to it ! 
I am loving this snow ! <3 
Driver's < PROPMALE > tomorrow <3 
It seems like everywhere I go , the more I see , the less I know . 
Inbox only : 2010 is almost over . Inbox me one thing ( or more if I'd like ) that you could not , or were not able to say to my face this year . It stays between us two and I wont judge . Repost this and see who surprises you ! 
I'm going to see how long I can hold up against the new profile before facebook makes me change it ... who's with me ? :D 
The snow is < PROPFEMALE > beautiful !! :) 
So do we have a one hour delay or school or a snow day or what ??? 
eh , fuck it . :/ 
Uh-oh , uh-oh , here comes tomorrow . Uh-oh , uh-oh what will we borrow , now ? And pay back somehow ? 
Midterms tomorrow . 
Midterms are finally over . :) 
Imagine there's no countries , it isn't hard to do . Nothing to kill or die for , and no religion too . Imagine all the people , living life in peace . You may say I'm a dreamer , but I'm not the only one . I hope someday you will join us . And the world will live as one . <3 
Like this if you think I should make my dog a face book < PROPFEMALE > . 
The weather is so beautiful . All of the tree leaves and trigs and the bushes are encased in a thin layer of ice , it's so gorgeous ! <3 
If you message me with a number I will do the status-number-thingy because I am bored . =] 
111111 I also miss you and can't wait to work with you at Grossman this summer ! You are an awesome friend and I love our little talks at Grossman . I wonder if our little plaque is still hanging up at A & C . xD <3 
3.14159 ( haha , math related humor ): I don't know you all that well , but you seem very nice , and I like that you share my opinion on wall-mart . =] I hope college is going well for you , and I enjoyed being in marching band with you back when I was in 8th grade and you were in 12th . <3 
Going sledding with my neighbor and his friends , a bunch of eight graders . I'm such a nerd . xD But I don't care if you think I'm crazy for sledding in this weather , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Egerton ! 
YOU AND I WAKE UP IN JAIL TOGETHER ... Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . 
Typical Super-bowl < PROPMALE > light commercial : * something dumb promoting and normalizing alcoholic behavior , such as a man choosing a beer over a girlfriend * Narrating guy \Drink responsibly\ " .... hypocrites " 
Don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are ? You grew up way too fast , and now there's nothing to believe , and reruns all become our history . A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio , and I won't tell no one your name . <3 
What ever tomorrow brings I'll be there , with open arms and open eyes . 
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind , for me it happens all the time ... 
I'm so glad it's finally Friday afternoon . :) 
You don't have to lie to me again , you don't have to try to be my friend , you don't have to tell me that you're better off alone , so don't ... and it's not easy , but nothing ever is , and it's not my mission to make this any worse , but I've tried every trick that I could find , and it still hurts ... <3 
I need another story\ 
Something to get off my chest\ 
My life gets kind of boring\ 
Need something that I can confess . 
It's ironic how we ignore those who want us , want those who ignore us , love those who hurt us , and hurt those who love us . 
Strawberry/blueberry 
just had a pretty awesome weekend . :) 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , won't you come out to play ? Dear < PROPFEMALE > , greet the brand new day . The sun is up , the sky is blue . It's beautiful and so are you ... Dear < PROPFEMALE > won't you come out and play ? Dear < PROPFEMALE > open up your eyes . Dear < PROPFEMALE > see the < PROPFEMALE > skies . The wind is low , the birds all sing\ 
that you are part of everything . Dear < PROPFEMALE > won't you open up your eyes ? <3
