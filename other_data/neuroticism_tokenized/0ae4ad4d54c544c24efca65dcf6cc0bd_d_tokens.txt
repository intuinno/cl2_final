Love burns across the infinitude 
It's weird hearing Owl City on the radio . 
Herald the WEIRDO'S! Summon the LOSERS and the FREAKS . Here come the frightened and forgotten with fire in their eyes . They walk tall and trees applaud , skyscrapers bow , mountains are dwarfed by these children of another dimension . Their prayers summon the hounds of heaven and invoke the ancient dream of Eden . And this vision will be . It will come to pass ; it will come easily ; it will come soon . 
Pray for my mom , ya'll . She has a horse running at Keenland today . And it would be nice to actually do well . 
Love , for the day is near . 
All that you loved , all that you treasure , will pass with time . Blinded by the inability to see beyond flesh and blood . Shifting blame with a log in your eye . Insisting that a string tied to your limbs is what’s to blame 
The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world . On the contrary , they have divine power to demolish strongholds . We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God , and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ . -2 Corinthians 10:4 -5

The entire sky is grey and overcast . Except for where the sun is setting . So the sun is shining on all the orange trees . And they look so pretty and bright in contrast to the grey sky . It looks amazing . I wish I could have taken a picture ! 
God's pretty much blowing my mind right now with His beauty . esdfgh 
Where your greatest passion lies , there lies your God . 
And if we are the body , how'd the pretty men get so ugly ? How'd he get all these spaces between each limb ? 
And without faith it is impossible to please God , because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him . -Hewbrews 11:6 
We are soldiers in an army of the immortal . And when we speak life- life happens . And when we speak healing- healing happens . And when we speak truth- truth happens . And when we go take what we have found to a dead world , we’ll see it come to life again . And when we take what we have found to a hopeless world , we’ll see hope come back . We’ll see the heart of our world start beating again 
So few come and don't go 
And do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind . Teach me to do Your will , for You are my God ; Your Spirit is good . Lead me in the land of uprightness . 
I for real want a snuggie . 
Tonight ... I laughed so hard I cried . Life is good .

The vision is people breaking cycles , making change . The vision is the possibility that your best days are ahead . The vision is the possibility that we're more loved than we know . The vision is hope . Hope is real . You are not alone . This is not the end of your story 
You were created to love and be loved . You were meant to live life in relationship with other people , to know and be known . You need to know that your story is important and that you're part of a bigger story . You need to know that your life matters . 
God risked Himself on me . I will risk myself on you . And together , we will learn to love , and perhaps then , and only then , understand this gravity that < PROPFIRST > Him , unto us .

So much for a nap :p The world seems against me having a nap today . lol 
I think the closer we get to God and the more we start loving Him , the less difficult it becomes for us to obey . The things you thought were so important before , somehow seem unimportant . It won't be so difficult to make sacrifices . We'll just do it because we want to please Him . We'll do it out of love . 
Finally got her nap . :p

Is completely alone in this town . With the exception of my brother . 
\I have had 3 teachers call me an instigator and I always thought it meant investigator . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Liao HAHAHA " 
Honestly ... There is absolutely nothing you could ever do or say to me to make me change what I believe . So it's basically pointless to argue with me about it . Don't waste your time . 
\The simple lack of you is more to me than others presence . \"" 
< PROPMALE > Connors and < PROPFEMALE > make my day better . 
For some reason this reminds me of this reminds me of the Grinches smile ----> :} 
wishes she was not in Nicholasville , KY right now . :/ 
is going hiking tomorrow . So excited . God , I love how beautiful you've made this world ! 
Something's missing . 
No , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us . For I am convinced that neither death nor life , neither angels nor demons , neither the present nor the future , nor any powers , neither height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord . Romans 8 : 37-39 
had a fantastic day . But it's always nice to be home . So sleepy . Goodnight , world . 
Dear AnyoneWhoLikesKesha , Why ? 
is awake . Coffee ? Yes . 
Jesus only did what he saw You do . He would only say what he heard You speak . He would only move when he felt You lead , following Your heart following Your spirit . How could I expect to walk without You when every move that Jesus made was in surrender . I would not begin to live without You for You alone are worthy , and You are always good . 
thinks it's really annoying when people lie . 
Some days I really just prefer animals to humans . 
So much for getting out of the house tonight .. 
Weedin ' out the creepers . 
Oh , why do I let myself let go of Hands that painted the stars and hold tears that fall ? And the pride of my heart makes me forget it's not me but You who makes the heart beat . I'm lost without You and dying from me . Will my life find me by Your side ? Your love is beautiful . At the end of it all I wanna be in Your arms . 
As they say ... Necessity is the mother of invention . 
He heals the bokenhearted and binds up their wounds . Psalm 147:3 
No matter where I move to , there is always a really annoying dog that NEVER SHUTS UP . 
Someone just rang my doorbell . Totally not answering . It's probably my neighbors coming to yell at me and tell me to stop singing so obnoxiously loud . HAHAAAAAAAAA 
wants to take < PROPMALE > classes . 
I can breathe easier when I know you're okay . 
wants to be in < PROPMALE > , Florida right now .

I wish i had a friend that would go walk in the park with me . lol 
Ultimate frisbee anyone ?! 
Thank you , Lord , for such a beautiful day ! I need to get outside !!! 
Well Keenland was nice . Minus the heat , and the large congregation of drunken idiots . 
I . Neeed . Gassss . Mask . * coughgaspcough * 
Happy Easter everyone !!! :D 
What to do ... 
Hangin out with the brother . :] 
Is going to ponder the intricacies of cinema . 
will probably be spending my day reading my new book , drinking coffee , enjoying the sunshine , and talking to my alien friend . :D 
Psalm 91 is pretty awesome . You should read it . 
Justified . 
God , you love me just the way I am , so why shouldn't I ? 
Someone please tell me why people aren't wearing any shoes today . 
One scarf from banana republic is sixty dollars ... no thank you ! 
Dance party with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > .

Life is just a little bit frustrating . 
Lose the weight of defeat . Its time to stand your ground . 
Not a good day . 
It is Friday night and since < PROPFIRST > St. Ama isn't here I'm going stay in and read my book .

No you cannot pay me in gum . 
Coachella would be fun to go to .

You show that you are a letter from Christ , the result of our ministry , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts . 2 Corinthians 3:3

Where You go , I go . 
Wonderful day :] 
South African accents are so cool . 
Kentucky is seriously so gorgeous in the spring time . 
I seriously am laughing my butt off at some of the movies they have on Hulu . 
worries too much . 
Bad dreams . 
is out of it today . 
I'll be looking at the < PROPFEMALE > , but I'll be seeing you . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Holiday . Really . 
What a wonderful start to my day ... Not . 
What a beautiful sunset . God is such a great artist . 
I am a treasure in the arms of Christ . 
I need an inciting incident . 
is having a tough time . 
This morning .. I woke up singing an NSYNC song . Why ? 
Walk The Line is a good movie . 
There is no fear in love , but perfect love casts out fear . 
is having such a hard time concentrating . 
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge , but fools despise wisdom and discipline . Proverbs 1:7 
I hate the way that things always change so suddenly . Thank you , Lord , for never changing . 
is listening to a sermon titled The Heart of Communication : Communicating Without Shame . haha Yesss . Definitely needed to hear this one . 
I give up . < PROPMALE > Connors is such a distraction . 
Headache :/ 
Oprah basically gets to be nosy for a living . 
wishes she was about 13 hours away in Texas right now . 
Distance is taking its toll . 
Keenland in the early morning is my favorite place . 
Side note : Duct tape fixes everything . 
Fear not , for I am with you ; do not be dismayed , for I am your God . I will strengthen you , yes , I will help you , I will uphold you with my righteous right hand . < PROPMALE > 41:10

Is no longer upset . :D I am so excited to see what God is going to do in my life in the few months to come ! 
is thankful for the rain . 
is working on being the woman God has called her to be . 
All to You , I surrender , everything , every part of me . All to You , I surrender , all of my dreams , all of me . If worship's like perfume , I'll pour mine out on You . For there is none as deserving of my love like You . So take my hand and draw me into You , I want to be swept away , lost in love for You . 
Everything is going to be okay . 
Lightsaber fighting with flashlights around the house ... Heck . Yes . 
It really is the thought that counts . 
Your love makes it worth it all . 
Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial , because when he has stood the test , he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him . < PROPFIRST > 1:12 
It's the simple things that make me happy . Going to sit out in the sun and read my book . :] 
Love is not affectionate feeling , but a steady wish for the loved person's ultimate good as far as it can be obtained . CS < PROPFIRST > 
I hate bad dreams .

Thunder !!!!! :D 
Love always trusts . 
A father to the fatherless , a defender of widows , is God in his holy dwelling . Psalm 68:5

Moms homemade chicken and dumplings ... That should cheer me up a bit . 
Flood . Go away stupid rain . You're ruining people's houses . 
Tomorrow : Coffee , breakfast , yoga , shower , < PROPFIRST > Discoll , Bible , journal , C.S. < PROPFIRST > . And I'm praying for sunshine as well . Should be a fairly decent day . Thank You , Lord , for the simple pleasures in life . 
Wait .. what ? The sun is shining ? 
It's my facebook and if you don't like what I post up here I don't care . You don't have to be friends with me . So don't leave negative comments on my posts . Thank you . 
meh ... 
You know what I hate more than anything else in the entire world ? Lies . I hate lies about as much as I hate satan . 
May the 4th be with you . HA 
is currently a wifi bandit since cable and internet is out for some reason . 
The stars are unusually bright ans twinkly tonight . 
As they say ... Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
is trying to stay positive . 
absolutely hates being a sinful human being . My spirit is willing by my flesh is weak . 
You vegetabelieve it . 
thinks it would be great to be a roadie for Invisible Children . 
Don't complain about being pale to me ... Chances are you're still like 10 shades darker than me . 
is so unhappy . 
doesn't really understand why people like those animal bracelets so much . 
Your kingdom come , Your will be done on EARTH as it is in HEAVEN . 
lost her phone at church . :/ 
is going to apply for lowes ... Maybe there's a < PROPMALE > I won't have to spend the summer in < PROPFEMALE > and I'll have the house to myself for the summer . Heck ya 
Auctioneers are crazy . 
Dear Everyone , You are special . And you are loved so much . 
When I go into the mall ... I do not want you to straighten my hair , I do not want a massage in the middle of the mall , I do not want you to pluck my eye brows with a thread , I do not want to try your lotions , I don't want your fake hair clips , and I don't want you to buff my nails ... And if I do I'll let you know . 
should probably like .. sleep .. or something . 
... People . 
Coffee and I Love < PROPFEMALE > reruns . 
Doubt thou the stars are fire ; doubt that the sun doth move ; doubt truth to be a liar ; but never doubt I love . 
Is watching the news . A man murdered a guy because his dog peed in his yard . What is wrong with people ? 
Life aint easy for a boy named < PROPFEMALE > . 
Is going fishing ! For the first time ever . Haha 
You know youre a redneck if ... you park your car in your front lawn ... 
I wonder how many divorces and failed relationships it's going to take for people to realize they're doing it all wrong . 
\To love is to be vulnerable . The only place outside Heaven where you can be safe from the dangers of love is Hell . \"" 
Hi . My name's < PROPMALE > and I save people money . 
It'd be nice to have some encouragement instead of being insulted for a change . 
absolutely cannot and will not tolerate being lied to .

Come Lord like you promised . Come with healing in Your touch . Come with fire in Your eyes . Just like You said you would . Come with grace and mercy . Come with judgement and might just like You said you would . Lord come restore Your Bride 
Sometimes this world seems bigger than it is , and I know You’re telling me to cast my cares aside and you know I try , but these walls I’ve built just won’t let me see You . Cause I’ve barricaded these tendencies . My selfish pride , these things inside , they always get the best of me . Show me love , teach me truth , break my heart and bring me back to You . Of all this world it’s you I wanna see . 
is getting real tired of Facebook posting inappropriate things on peoples walls . 
thinks that people who drive through neighborhoods with their music turned up as loud as it can go are really obnoxious . Seriously .. it's a constant thing on my street . 
This has probably been the least productive , most boring day I've had in quite some time . I can't wait to get out of Kentucky 
There goes those gangstas bumpin down my street again . 
doesn't like it when people turn into divas when they're hungry . 
The only thing consistent about the relationships I have with the people in my life is that they are consistently inconsistent . People always come and go . No one ever stays for long . Thank You , Lord , for never changing and always loving me , even when the people and things of this world are constantly coming and going . 
Dropped ANOTHER phone in the toilet . I hate myself . 
You don't ever want me around any kind of electronics . haha 
I don't flirt . Like ... ever . 
is concerned and a little bit stressed . 
can't help but be a little envious of those who are in happy relationships . But I know I'm still young , and I know God has everything under control . So I'm waiting patiently on Him . His timing is perfect . 
is really struggling at the moment . 
So what I'm not your average girl . I don't meet the standards of this world . Chasing after boys is not my thing . 
I find it really annoying that I can't add music to my profile without \liking\ " the < PROPFEMALE >." 
They really should make waterproof phones . 
wishes she could watch Dear < PROPFIRST > right now . Love that movie . 
I just feel so much better about life when my house is clean ... lol 
is all dressed up with nowhere to go and no one to < PROPFEMALE > out with . lol Sad . 
I wanna go camping . 
Well ... my phone is working again ... for the most part . 
I promise I'll give more than I get . 
Does anyone else think the whole \kthxbai\ " thing is really annoying ? " 
< PROPFEMALE > makes me laugh . 
Frosted Flakes are more than good ... They're GRRRRRRREAT . 
People are really hurtful 
is having a terrible day already .. 
Thank you , lord , for < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Hes so happy all the time that you cant help but be happy too . 
When everything is falling apart you will be safe in His arms . 
just knocked over an entire jug of laundry detergent . It's everywhere . SGDHSFGHSDGAFGH -____- 
I hope you meet someone your height , so you can see eye to eye with someone as small as you . 
has had a pretty dang good weekend so far . G'night facebook . :] 
And so , steadfast and undeterred , I will proclaim the name of Christ to a dead and dying world . I am not ashamed ! We will resist our sin to the point of blood , and we will wear our scars like badges of honor . But let our hope cry out that our God is greater than the pain of persecution . Blinded , I saw that Christ is Lord . Now , may the world see You through open eyes . God , my Father , reign . -For Today 
is going to < PROPFEMALE > out with her brother . :] 
If grace is an ocean , we're all sinking . 
When my world is shaking , Heaven stands .

is watching One Big Happy Family on TLC right now . I think I love it . 
thinks facebook is dumb sometimes 
will be gone from Nicholasville , Ky for the entire summer in a matter of days . Not sure if I'm happy about it or not . 
Can I just have everything on modcloth.com? Please ? 
Life's good . Going to get my packing/ house work done , hanging out with Jaron later , then tomorrow ... Gettin ' the heck outta Nicholasville , Ky ! WOOO ! 
I'm awkward . 
Hey girls ... A bit of modesty wouldn't hurt anyone . 
I love and miss < PROPFEMALE > Patterson , < PROPFEMALE > Patterson Merritt , and < PROPFEMALE > Patterson < PROPFIRST > all equally . :D 
I know I smile a lot and act like everything's alright . But it's really not . Nothing's alright . 
is it really that hard to make plans and follow through with them ? I just want to leave already . Irritated and disappointed . 
I've been here before , now here I am again . Standing at the door , praying You'll let me back in . To label me a hypocrite would be only scratching the surface of who I've been known to be . Turn me around , pick me up , undo what I've become . Bring me back to the place of forgiveness & grace . I need You , I need Your help . I can't do this myself . You're the only one who can undo what I've become . 
I just wanna forget yesterday even happened . 
I love naps . 
Cool guys don't look at explosions . 
I want to make some no-bake cookies . 
There is an amount of love , an amount of grace beyond all meaning , beyond all measure . There is no greater love than laying your life down for a friend . If we loved God to a teaspoon of his overflowing cup , what would this world then see ? Our land of sorrow and turmoil would swirl to a community of joy , open our eyes to glisten , open our hearts to receive , and open our mouths to smile . This is a love that none can fathom 
The sound of a group of believers coming together to worship the same God is one of the most beautiful things to me . Really and truly . 
can't stay awake any longer 
is leaving Friday morning . For real this time . 
\It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a < PROPMALE > man to enter the kingdom of God . \ " < PROPFIRST > 19:24 "

I love Mr. < PROPFEMALE > ... lol 
In our weakness , You remain . When we're broken , You sustain . 
It's pink outside . Literally .... pretty much the entire sky is pink . It's kinda awesome . 
Facebook is dumb . I my \suggestions\ " it says \ " Matt ________ . He needs a profile picture . Suggest a profile picture . \ " What will they think of next ? " 
Oh for goodness sake ! I don't need an update in my news feed every time someone changes their profile picture . Seriously , Facebook . Seriously . 
Why am i still awake ... 
Sigh ... last day in town . 
I don't think I will ever drink capri sun again . 
is leaving in the morning for < PROPFEMALE > . Might not have internet . So ya'll will have to text me . If you don't have my number message me and I might give it to you . :P haha And if you don't have my number you can just message me on here . I have facebook mobile . 
Is on the road . :)

Fainting goats are awesome .

It's pretty sad when your day off is the day you get to go home at 5 in the afternoon rather than 8:30 in the evening . Lol 
Has a big mouth and a big temper . I should really learn to not speak at all when I'm upset . 
Thinks everyone should dress like they did in the 40's and 50's . 
Its pretty sad when you spend the summer in a place that makes you greatful for living in Nicholasville .. lol 
Oh my goodness . Sooo happy for a break in the hot weather . 79 degrees right now . Perfect . :) 
Breaking New : Two women and a four-wheeler run over by a deer .

Inception was a good movie . 
Should probably be sleeping . Church in the morning . So excited to see my church family . 
I could probably write a book about my life . A long one . It would become a best-seller and then lifetime would wanna make it into a movie . That's how dramatic my life is . lol 
Lunch with < PROPMALE > Connors ! :] 
Ya done goofed 
I love < PROPMALE > Groban . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Staton . :] 
Drink . My . Hot . Kool-aid . 
I hope you meet someone your height so you can see eye to eye with someone as small as you . 
When the going gets tough .... Everyone leaves . 
Is playing COD with my bro . Haha 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails . 
You make everything glorious . And I am Yours . What does that make me ? 
Family drama just never freaking ends ... 
I know I have a temper and I come off as mean to some people . But I'm really not , I swear . :( 
Please keep your negative comments to yourself . Thanks

Well ... when all else fails .. curl up with your snuggie and read a book .

Woah ... Google is awesome . 
Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give you . I do not give to you as the world gives . Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid . < PROPFIRST > 14:27

Most ridiculously boring day of my liffffe . 
Awful Waffle with my best frannn :]

It's a bittersweet symphony , this life . 
has lots to smile about .

.... Such a strange day . 
Life goes by way too fast . 
Why are office supplies so fun ? 
Why are there NO good movies playing ? 
It's just way to easy to stalk people on facebook . 
Frustrated . 
just got rid of all the creepers . 
feels terrible today . 
I'm tired of seeing all these dang cute , happy couples everywhere . 
I give up making plans . None of them EVER work out . Good thing God knows what He's doing . Cause I sure as heck don't! 
Coffee . 
Wahmei . YES . 
I am what I am and that's all that I am . 
So incredibly sleepy . 
I wish life was just a little bit easier and a little less complicated . 
I hate today . 
Oh Love that will not let me go , I rest my weary soul in thee . 
Dear Life , Slow down . Please and thank you . -Chels . 
I need to write more . 
Everyone leaves . 
Ice cream makes everything better . 
Humility is one of the best traits anyone could have . 
I'm pretty sure < PROPMALE > Groban was sent straight from heaven . 
Moms homemade chicken and dumplings ... YES !! 
I kinda can't get enough of Ascend The Hill . 
I REALLY want that big huge fluffy dog I always see in the mall . Who knows what I'm talking abou 
What the crap is up with this wind ? 
Sooo .... The severe weather siren is going off ... sweet . 
TORNADER ! 
is currently unsatisfied with life . 
I don't wanna go out for Halloween . I just wanna stay home and eat a caramel apple .. and lots of < PROPFEMALE > and watch scary movies . Too bad I have none of those things ! :( haha 
Someone PLEASE take me to Ireland . 
needs to learn how to be more sociable , less shy , and less sensitive . 
If it gets any easier for people to stalk me on facebook I'm seriously just gonna have to delete it . The whole \see friendship\ " thing ? Come on now ... " 
I just want to travel the world for the rest of my life . haha 
It's only a matter of time before I meet < PROPFIRST > Young and he falls madly in love with me and proposes . 
has issues . 
Omgosh facebook is stupid .

I'm just gonna be a rock < PROPFEMALE > . 
Prettiest sunset ive ever seen right now 
Here we go again ... again . 
Crappy day . 
I love the south . 
Below freezing temperatures are so NOT okay . 
I wish I were anywhere but home right now . 
Where Your < PROPFEMALE > is I wanna be . Where Your beauty is I wanna see . Where Your scars are born I’ll lay a kiss , ’cause it’s your presence , Lord , that I miss . You blow me away . You’re beautiful . 
I don't know how to put this but ... I'm kind of a big deal . People know me . 
The ice cream man is STILL making his daily drive through my neighborhood about twice a day . I'm convinced he's a drug dealer . 
Wonders why some people like really stupid horror movies . 
Breakfast for dinner . YES . 
needs a freakin hug . 
Dang , I'm gonna miss Kentucky . :/ 
I fail at so many things in life . So thankful for His grace and forgiveness . 
Got the fire going , watching < PROPMALE > potter , and eating pizza at the best friends house . Heck yeah ! 
I eat way too much sometimes . 
I love this rain . So much . 
Its not even five yet and its already dark outside . :( 
Everyone else went out and bought the new ADTR cd ... I went and got the new < PROPMALE > Groban cd . hahahahaha I am such a loser . 
I'm moving to Ireland . 
What the heck .

Someone come < PROPFEMALE > out with me . 
Horrible freaking mood . 
needs some serious encouragement . :/ 
Cause I need freedom now , and I need to know how to live my life as it's meant to be . 
I hate when I delete someone off Facebook and they still show up in my news feed . :/ 
If I could just be in two places at once .... Or just have the ability to teleport all of my problems would be solved . 
Snow :) 
Dying for something is easy because it is associated with < PROPFEMALE > . Living for something is the hard thing . Living for something extends beyond fashion , < PROPFEMALE > , or recognition . We live for what we believe . - < PROPFIRST > Miller 
Ugh ... can't sleep . :/ No more caffeine late at night for me . 
I wave my hair back and forth I wave my hair back and forth I wave my hair back and forth .. shut up !!!

Why am I ALWAYS tired ? 
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself . 
Fun night . :) 
SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW ! YES !!!

Love it will not betray you , dismay or enslave you . It will set you free . Be more like the man you were made to be . There is a design , an alignment , a cry of my heart to see , the beauty of love as it was made to be . 
Zombiessssssssssssssssss . 
needs a hug . :/ 
Those < PROPFIRST > are really pissin me off . 
Don't innerup ! Ruuude . 
If today was not an endless highway , if tonight was not a crooked trail , if tomorrow wasn't such a long time then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all . 
I swear if I see one more freaking number status .. 
Humility is seriously one of the most attractive qualities anyone could have . :) 
Well , OBVIOUSLY we have a basilisk in Hogwarts school . Hes climbin up yo staircase , snatchin yo Muggleborns up , tryin to petrify em , so yall need to hide yo Gryffindors , hide yo Hufflepuffs , and hide yo Ravenclaws cuz they petrifyin errybody out here .

This world kinda sucks . Boys suck . I'm tired . This status is probably going to make people question my sanity . 
Bring on the snow .

Not my chair , not my problem . 
It aint no thang . It's a hair flip . 
Finally making friends in Alabama . :) 
I swear we need to find some comfort in this run down place . 
Oh my gosh , goat cheese is disgusting .

After all the things I've seen in my life , all the good He's done for me , and all the prayers He's answered .. there is no possible way I could ever have doubts about my Heavenly Father .

Being an archaeologist would be sooooo cooooool . 
I love guys with beards . 
When i grow up , i wanna be a redneck . 
Okay so here's the plan . I'm gonna go to college and practice guitar like crazy . So I can fulfill my dream of being redneck rock < PROPFEMALE > archaeologist with her own show on the travel channel . Then in my travels I'll play with some baby lions and tigers and ride an elephant through the jungle ( it's on my bucket list ) . I gotta get on this ... 
Got a job !! Heck yeah . God is so faithful ! 
To give unselfishly , to love the least of these . Jesus i'm learning how to live with open hands . All of these treasures that i hold will never satisfy my soul . Jesus i lay it at your throne with open hands . 
OMG OMG OMG . < PROPFIRST > Beiber <3 
I don't wanna talk about you like you're not in the room . I wanna look right at you . I wanna sing right to you .

Snowing in Alabama .. again ? What the heck , mother nature . 
Hi , I'm a deseperate lonely girl looking for some attention , so I'm going to put on some revealing clothes and take pictures of myself in the mirror and post them on facebook . 
When lies become the truth , that's when I run to you . 
Love me some seafood . 
Shrimp and grits . Sounds weird . Tastes < PROPFEMALE > good . 
Dear Guys , It doesn't matter how good looking you are . If you have a horrible personality you're unattractive in my eyes . 
Grace is my < PROPFEMALE > , but pride is my home . Jesus , your words have called me from my comfort . I’ll give you my life , if you’ll hold it in your truth , because truth is the pursuit that captivates my soul . I stand before you redeemed . You are all I have . I could never want more than this . 
Omg . Girl Scout Cookes ... Samoas . They're like little pieces of heaven .. 
Ugh ... I might be a little bit ocd . 
I need to write more often . I need to spend less time on the internet and more time praying and digging into God's word . I need to practice guitar more . I'll never learn if I won't practice . I need to draw more and stop hating everything I do . I need to stop being so critical of myself . I need some inspiration . I need some Thin Mints . 
Valentines day is stupid . 
I think next time I'm on a date I'm gonna order either spaghetti , ribs .

Happy Valentines Day . -__-

The fact that my phone is still working is amazing to me . After being dropped in the toilet about three times and dropped about 50 times a day ... 
I gotta go get ready for work . BUMMER .

My heart , O God , is steadfast ; \ 
I will sing and make music with all my soul . \ 
Awake , harp and lyre ! \ 
I will awaken the < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
I will praise you , LORD , among the nations ; \ 
I will sing of you among the peoples . \ 
For great is your love , higher than the heavens ; \ 
your faithfulness reaches to the skies . \ 
Be exalted , O God , above the heavens ; \ 
let your < PROPFEMALE > be over all the earth . \ 
-Psalm 108:1 -5 
I am a nerd . 
<--------------- This girl needs a hug . 
I seriously need to work on MEMORIZING scripture . 
I've been blessed with great jobs . I've never had to work in fast food or retail . And despite the fact that I complain about having to go to work , really like my job . I just don't like these crazy hours . From here on out I will NOT complain about work . I prayed for this job and God answered it my prayers . It's silly to complain about it ... especially when there are so many people out of work right now . I'm blessed . 
I seriously don't understand why more people dont use coupons . They're basically giving you money . Uh ... Yes please . I'll take some free money ! I <3 coupons . 
Yes !! My mom is sending me some Ale 8 . Hallelujah ! I'm so excited . 
I just spent way more money in Lifeway than I planned .... but it was all for the < PROPFEMALE > of the Lord so I guess it's okay ! Lol 
You seriously never know how much your family means to you until you come close to losing them . 
Carnival with my little sisters . Fair food . Heck . Yes !! 
Ive consumed wayyyyy too much sugar in the past twenty minutes . Ahahhaa 
Come be the fire inside of me . Come be the flame upon my heart . 
Is it weird that I'm nervous about making my family dinner ? lol I hope they like it ! 
\I could not help but think that somewhere along the way we had missed what is radical about our faith and replaced it with what is comfortable . We were settling for a Christianity that revolves around catering to ourselves when the central message of Christianity is actually about abandoning ourselves . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Platt " 
In the middle of my little mess I forget how big I'm blessed . 
Jesus Culture is so good . I can't get enough of worship . 
Zoo !! 
Can i have a squirrel monkey please ? 
Flipburger disclaimer : do not drink the milkshake until the liquid nitrogen has evaporated . 
Fun , adventurous day for sure . But man I'm tired . 
All my Kentucky peeps ... My mom has got a horse running at Keeneland on Saturday . Pray he does well ! lol 
Someone help me with guitar . lol 
Every heart has an hour of existence . Every breath brings a < PROPMALE > for redemption . If somehow we could wake up . Let us love like we were children . Make us feel like we're still living in a world I know that's burning to the ground . Give us time to beat the system . Make us find what we've been missing . 
I have 666 friends on fb . HA . 
I am falling madly in love with Jesus . 
What was it like when You slept ? Did the rocks come close and the trees < PROPFEMALE > in ? And did the air rejoice just to be Your breath ? 
My little sisters always make me feel better . Love them so much . 
When I grow up I'm gonna have my own garden and grow my own herbs and vegetables . And have my own chickens and have fresh eggs . It'll be awesome . 
It would be nice to have some people in my life who would actually stick around . Friends .. True friends are so hard to find . People just come and go like it's nothing . I guess that's why family is so important . 
I'm already tired of hearing about 4 freaking 20 . Shut . Up . 
Serious thunderstorm going on right now . <3 it . 
I miss < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Frazier . 
Facebook is stupid . 4/20 is stupid . Pot heads are stupid . My inability to teleport is STUPID ... I'm done complaining now . 
I DO NOT LOOK LIKE < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
I love you . Yes you . 
I love Easter . 
Also ... I love music . It's basically the greatest thing ever . I don't know how I would get through life without it . 
Though the world seems to forget , we will not forget who You are and what You've done for us . 
Going to the drive in with my family ! :) 
Family dance partay !! Haha memories . <3 
So glad my family wasn't blown away by the tornado . <3 haha 
Death is beaten , You have rescued me . Sing it out , Jesus is alive !! 
After working all night , all I wanna do is sleep . But it's Easter . I'm not missing out on today !!! I HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH ! 
Absolutely exhausted . 
Can anyone say \Slap happy \"?" 
I . Want . Food . 
Mmm bop . 
I wanna learn to play the piano . And the mandolin . lol But first I have to learn how to play my flippin guitar -__- 
God is so good . 
It's like every hipsters goal to look like as much of a pedophile as possible . Or so it seems ... 
So there's basically 100% < PROPMALE > o ' tornaders tomorra . Hope they all bypass good ol ' Guin , Alabama . 
I'm bored out of my ever lovin ' mind . So what am I gonna do ? I'm gonna blow up peoples news feed ... and eat . 
Mother nature can knock it out already . 
I'm okay , ya'll . All I can say is God is great ... There were tornados everywhere up above , below , and all around . But they all seemed to miss us . My heart is broken for all of these people . 
I want to get my hands dirty and find some way to help these people . 
So .. If anyone here in Alabama wants to get together and figure out how we can get stuff together to help with everything ... Let me know . OR if you are already doing something to help let me know and I'll join in . I seriously can't sit here and do nothing . 
Woah , what ? I have cell phone service now ? PTL 
QUIT COMPLAINING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ! If you don't like something then freakin do something about it and quit complaining . People are all talk . Put some actions to those words . 
MY MOM JUST SENT ME ALE 8 . Praise the Lord , Hallelujah ! I'm so happy . 
\That's not fat . That's my protective muscle layer . \ " lolol " 
Porch sitting is the best . 
Working on stepping out of my comfort zone .... I pretty much hate it . 
Hey , let's all post a status about Osama bin Laden . 
These feelings won't go away . They've been knockin ' me sideways . I keep thinking in a moment that time will take them away , but these feelings won't go away . 
I believe in restoration .
