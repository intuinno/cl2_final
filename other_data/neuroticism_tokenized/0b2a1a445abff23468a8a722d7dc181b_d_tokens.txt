Happy New Year !!!! 

I'm bored so I will take an obvious poll . Who loves < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr. Day ? 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has AUTISM . A goal for 2010 is that people will understand autism is not a disease ; people with autism are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE ...... 93% won't Copy and Paste this , will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
have you noticed how people will say not to \judge them by their cover\ " ? yet these same people will go around and simply for example say that twilight sucks even though they have never read or seen it ? i myself am not saying that twilight is good . but i'm not saying its bad either . how can I if i have never read or seen it ? P.S. I have heard some of Miley < PROPMALE>'s music and can safely say that she sucks :) " 
Just spent about half of an hour I'll never get back looking at flair . That stuff should not be allowed to be that fun . 
Just became friends with people I haven't seen since I moved . 
Exams ? Let me at ' em ! Of course , if they were to spontaneously burst into flames I'd be perfectly fine that .

A poem you see , \ 
Exacts a small fee . \ 
A stretch of the mind , \ 
A flick of the wrist . \ 
But I think you will find , \

In sanity .

Why can't computers just work ? Why must there be bugs and glitches ? 
Rest In Peace < PROPFEMALE > Gannon . Words can not describe how much this community already misses you . I myself did not know you all that well , but I think that it is obvious from the reactions to your death that you were loved . It is in times like this that communities are brought together , and we see the changes that need to be made . I think that a change for the better is exactly what is needed to heal our community . 
I need names for the lamest supervillain and his/her power !
