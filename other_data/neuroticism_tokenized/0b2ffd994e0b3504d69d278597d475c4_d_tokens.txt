Was going to do homework .. definetely deciding against it . And the procrasination lives on . 
Fed up with Tiger Woods on my homepage . Doing homework what else is new ?

Dear Organic Chemistry , I hate you . I am so glad I only have to suffer learning about you for approximately two more weeks . Please die . 
Homework until I work 3-11 . What a life I live .. 
One day your life will flash before your eyes . Make sure its worth watching .. 
all kinds of homework .. don't even know where to begin . 
Dear Organic Chemistry , You have owned my life every friday from 9-2 . I will not be sad to see you go today .. I hope I never have to endure your class ever again . Thanks for screwing up my life and making me feel more stupid than I have ever felt in my life . Good riddance . P.S. I hope actually pass :)

Wrapping up some surprises & snuggling with the love of my life watching Friends <3 
Working the first of at least 5 in a row .. 3-11 tonight 7-3 tomorrow . 
I am no one special . There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten . But in one respect , I've succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived ... I've loved another with all my heart and soul and for me , that's always been enough . < PROPFIRST > Barba <3 
snuggling up and going to bed soon =) 
There is only one happiness in life --- to love and to be loved . <3 < PROPFIRST > Barba 
Cleaning my room & doing laundry--aren't I lucky ? 
snuggling the love of my life <3 
You believe in me .. like nobody ever has .. When my world goes crazy .. you're right there to save me .. You make me see how much I have .. <3 < PROPFIRST > Barba

There are four questions of value in life ... What is sacred ? Of what is the spirit made ? What is worth living for , and what is worth dying for ? The answer to each is the same . Only love . <3 < PROPFEMALE > 
Teen Mom season finale . I love my life <3

The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience , but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy . 
Why ? Why are they making me take this music class ?

Work 7-3 
Completely not looking forward to working 7-3 & wishing life was a little bit simpler 
Sleep work 7-3 and family fun night tomorrow =) <3 
We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have , but rather from recognizing and appreciating what we do have . 
I hate you microbiology . 
work 7 am-11pm Off on saturday though =) <3 
Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you , when you think everything's going right ... 
i dont want to go to school especially in the rain =( 
I knock on the door hope isn't home faith's not around the lucks all gone , don't ask me what's wrong , ask me what's right -- and Im gonna tell you l.i.f.e. 
Shower -- lunch at < PROPFEMALE > Tuesday -- Mini Golf -- maybe a walk at the ecology site .. it's going to be a beautiful day with the best man in the world . <3 
sleep , work 7a-11p 
LAST WEEKEND 3-11 SHIFT =) You no longer own my life =) =) =) 
staring at the ceiling . my nightly ritual . 
If you really put a small value upon yourself , rest assured the rest of the world will not raise your price . 
cant find the motivation to study for anatomy 
thankful for good friends & the good times we have 
snuggling up with < PROPFEMALE > and getting some much needed sleep <3 
Dear Microbiology , You are not the only thing that I have to study but you will own me until 6 am . Thank you for sucking all the joy out of my life & for filling my soul with hatred . <3 
large iced latte .. I'm ready to study 
Laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live <3 
the next time you see an accident on the road and the only thing you can think of is what an inconvenience it is for you please remember that its someones loved one . Say a prayer for them and then remember how precious our time is . don't take it for granted . 
up all night doing micro . 
Micro lab all night .. school .. pedi/mani after if anyone wants to join me . 
330 am up at 7 . good night 
Remember , always give your best . Never get discouraged . Never be petty . Always remember , others may hate you . But those who hate you don't win unless you hate them . And then you destroy yourself . 
Right now there is a nurse helping a woman become a mom , a nurse holding the hand of a dying man , a nurse inserting an IV in a child , a nurse listening to an alzheimers patient tell a story of long ago , a nurse missing their family while caring for yours . In the minute it took you to read this , nurses all over the world are saving lives . May 6-12 is National Nurses week - thank a nurse !!! 
Sleep for a few hours .. Up at 630 .. Dunkin for some coffee .. studying 8:30 -10 until anatomy final and then attempting to write my ten < PROPFEMALE > music paper . 4 days . <3 
at school attempting my music paper . statistics final at 12 . can't wait for this to be over . 
Success is failure turned inside out -- \ 
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt , \ 
And you never can tell how close you are , \ 
It may be near when it seems so far , \ 
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit -- \ 
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit . 
Not accomplishing anything .. I need to kick my behindddd into gear . Dunkin coffee & music paper + studying for micro all night . Pretty much my life <3 
lets talk about how my five < PROPFEMALE > music paper .. is just gone .. off my computer . 
Handing in my music paper .. picking up bubb at school .. going to lunch and then home to study for micro & nursing which is quite obnoxious . Spa party tonight <3 so looking forward to it . 
Love is everything it's cracked up to be . That's why people are so cynical about it . . . It really is worth fighting for , being brave for , risking everything for . And the trouble is .. if you don't risk anything . . . you risk even more . <3 
Advil , coffee , donuts , < PROPFEMALE > ale-->i'm ready for my last all nighter .. see all my favorite people at 8 am . Good luck girls <3 
work 7a-11p and i can't sleep =( 
yankee game with the love of my life 
Happyyy Birthday to < PROPFEMALE > Steyert Barba Going to celebrate & have a Pampered Chef party tonight . 
We \ 
have no right to ask when a sorrow comes , ' Why did this happen to me ? ' \ 
unless we \ 
ask the same question for every joy that comes our way . 
< PROPFEMALE > ho suck is at the mound . we are screwed . 
Never\ 
be bullied into silence . Never allow yourself to be made a victim . \ 
Accept no one's definition of your life ; define yourself . 
I hope it rains . Work at 7 and I can't sleep because it's too freakin ' hot . 
Love knows no limit to its endurance , no end to its trust , no fading of its hope ; it can outlast anything . Love still stands when all else has fallen . <3 
If you are not living on the edge .. you take up too much room <3 
No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others . The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude . <3 
Snuggling up with bubbss .. watching a movie .. bedtime .. work 7-3 .. nails with momma before my cousins wedding <3 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it\ 
is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily\ 
angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil , \ 
but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . <3 
I hope that my\ 
achievements in life shall be these-that I will have fought for what was\ 
right and fair , that I will have risked for that which mattered , and that I\ 
will have given help to those who were in need that I will have left the earth\ 
a better place for what I've done and who I've been . <3 
Beach with my love & Brinks baby <3 
I think my greatest ambition in life is to pass on to others what I know . <3 
The measure of a man's real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out . 
Little brothers graduation <3 
doctors all day 
Engaged to the best man in the world . <3 
I love my life . <3 
Thanks to everyone for all the well wishes & always being the best friends & family I could ever imagine . <3 
Please text or message phone < PROPFIRST > . I lost all of them 
text or fb message me your phone < PROPFIRST > =)

I hate packing =( 
It's the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live . 
You've got all the tal < PROPMALE > down .. just not the listening . Who cares if you disagree .. you are not me .. who died and made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? 
really don't want to work today . 
so done with work . 
I have the best family . 
Lunch with the best mom in the universe , movie with the best fiance , floating around in the pool and spending time with people I love . How could you ask for anymore ? 
Really don't want to work tomorrow .. not even a little bit . 
riverhead raceway babyy =) 
you are the only exception . 
I've learned that people will\ 
forget what you said , people will forget what you did , but people will\ 
never forget how you made them feel . 
date . 
I love sleeping in on my days off . 
love being seasick =) 
Nothing is more honorable than a grateful heart . 
Never judge a man's actions until you know his motives . 
The thing that is really hard , and really amazing , is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself . 
you should tell her she's beautiful everyday . 
It doesn't matter as long as we have each other . 
Getting some beauty rest for wedding dress shopping with my sister at Kleinfeld's tomorrow =) Can't wait--I'm so excited for her <3 
wish I was sleeping and not working . 
I want to go back to bed . 
you are the best thing that's ever been mine . 
So much homework . 
can't wait to get out of here and go shopping with my mom . 
some call it arrogant . I call it confident . 
hope work goes fast . then riverhead raceway . =) 
homework . forever . 
Our most basic instinct is not for survival but for family . Most of us would give our own life for the survival of a family member , yet we lead our daily life too often as if we take our family for granted . 
Yesterday is history . Tomorrow is a mystery . Today is a gift , that's why they call it the present . 
don't want to work tonight . 
cause in the end they'll judge me anyway .. so whateverr .. 
Can't believe I'm actually going to get up at 7 am to go to the gym instead of sleeping until 10 . This is completely out of character . Bridal boot camp with my sister < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Witt .. what are sisters for ? <3 
Develop an attitude of gratitude , and give thanks for everything that\ 
happens to you , knowing that every step forward is a step toward\ 
achieving something bigger and better than your current situation . 
homework all night . 
hour of cardio 
snuggling up and sleepiing till 545 then class =(

work and nursing school will ruin my weekend =) <3

Can we please let < PROPMALE > Swisher pitch ? 
930 am and today has already proved to be a bad day 
poor < PROPFIRST > y < PROPFIRST > . swisher you always pull through for us . 
swishalicious =) 
I gave up my life to learn how to save yours . 
thank you everyone for all of the birthday wishes =) I had a fabulous day . <3 
Life is a beach and I'm just playin ' in the sand <3 
homework until i go to sleep . so lucky . 
i cant find anything for this stupid < PROPMALE > paper . 
be good or be good at it . 
hope work is quick and painless . 
going to see life as we know it finally =) <3 
patho paper forever 
wish i was motivated to do any of my homework . 
guess i should write my paper .. idk 
please this class has to be over 
Everything I do , I do it for you <3 < PROPFIRST > Barba 
You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him . 
def not a good day . 
already want to go back to bed . work 7-3 then stusying forever . can't wait till tuesday-freedom =) 
You know you on the top when only heavens right above it <3 
Not studying for nutrition . Date with my < PROPMALE > Potter book because I'm clearly a loser .. and bedtime . Can't wait for tomorrow to be over and my grandparents to get here =) How blessed I am to have such a wonderful family . <3 
We\ 
can never judge the lives of others , because each person knows only\ 
their own pain and renunciation . It's one thing to feel that you are on\ 
the right path , but it's another to think that yours is the only path . 
Today I am thankful for my family and my friends . For the right to an education . For my health and my family's health . For being able to take care of myself and for the gift of being able to take care of others . For having a roof over my head and food always on my plate . Today .. I'm thankful to be surrounded by the ones I love . Have a great Thanksgiving everyone ! <3 
Character contributes to beauty . It fortifies a woman as her youth fades . A mode of conduct , a standard of courage , discipline , fortitude , and integrity can do a great deal to make a woman beautiful . 
3 day diet journal to prove that I eat too many calories , too much fat and too much sugar . What a waste -- I hate redundancy . 
guess i should start my paper now . 
I've never wanted a semester to end more . Pointless class and then quality time studying with < PROPFEMALE > AllweneedinLifeis Hope 
I need sleep . 
i can think of about five million things i would rather do than go to work right now .. 
worst night at work I've ever had . 
If you find somebody to love in this world you better < PROPFEMALE > on tooth and nail . <3 
What the head makes cloudy .. the heart makes very clear . <3 
You're going to come across people in your life who will say all the\ 
right words at all the right times . But in the end , it's always their\ 
actions you should judge them by . It's actions , not words , that\ 
matter . 
cause everybody dies but not everybody lives .. 
i hate fridays . i hate working 3-11 . i am not in a positive mood =) 
why are you speaking when no one asked you ? 
assessment demo ruining my life . k thanks . 
patho and pharm all day & all night . 
I wanna go to sleep =( 
today will kill me . 
we don't need no script for this . 
Spending time with my family for my daddy's birthday . Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
buhbyee school till January 19th =) <3 
christmas cookies with momma . 
I would rather have eyes that cannot see ; ears that cannot hear ; lips that cannot speak , than a heart that cannot love . 
reading < PROPMALE > potter by the fire with some hot cocoa in hand with some of the best family in the world . 
I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands ; you need to be able to throw something back . 
looking forward to little fockers tomorrow night with my family =) 
If you don't like something , change it . If you can't change it , change your attitude . 
I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart , I usually make the right decision . \ " , 2011-01-03 22:57:38 " 
\We delight in the beauty of a butterfly but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty . \"" 
work 7-3 then gym . 
< PROPFIRST > mcguire =) 
work . boo =( 
getting dressed for work and going to brave the storm . Oh , the things we do for our patients . 
full day ahead of me =) lots of fun though ! 
sick and do not want to go to work tomorrow . 
dinner then class 630-930 
there are very few trustworthy people in this world . 
< PROPMALE > that 
so proud of my booboo for getting accepted to his 5 year program ! ( I knew you would all along =)) 
and the homework begins . 
the company men =) 
Saw The Company Men earlier today and am going to see No Strings Attached tonight . I love six dollar Tuesdays =) 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Colly for closing <3 
my poor booboo has to drive me to work =( 
when will fluids and electrolytes stop owning my life ? 
“I have long since come to believe that people never mean half of what they say , and that it is best to disregard their talk and judge only their actions” 
i will be slaving over my med surg book . yey for school ( not ) =( 
if you aint got love its all just keeping score ... 
I'm flawed but I am cleaning up so well .. I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself ... 
I hate to break it to you babe ... but I'm not drowning .. there's no one here to save .. 
yay for JERSday =) 
I do not want to be at work . I want to go back home and snuggle up in my bed before I do hours of homework . I needa change . 
I have decided that there is no good reason to go into nursing . I have never wanted to quit school as much as I do right now at this very moment . I wish I was somewhere else doing something I actually liked . 
If there's just one piece of advice i can give you , it's this - when there's something you really want , fight for it , don't give up no matter how hopeless it seems . And when you've lost hope , ask yourself if 10 years from now , you're gonna wish you gave it just one more shot . because the best things in life ... they don't come free . 
At the end of the day faith is a funny thing . It turns up when you dont really expect it . Its like one day you realize that the < PROPFEMALE > tale may be slightly different than you dreamed . The castle well it may not be a castle . And its not so important happy ever after just that its happy right now . See once in a while , once in a blue < PROPFEMALE > people will surprise you and once in a while people may even take your breath away . 
Some call it arrogant , I call it confident . <3 
Get busy living or get busy dying . 
Always give more than you take . 
clinical 7-3 gym mommas 
had such an awesome valentines day . I'm the luckiest person in the world . 
I don't wanna go to the gym-im sleepy =( 
I'm just gonna wake up in the morning and say \today's gonna be a bad day\ " that way I'm not disappointed when it is and I will be happy if it turns out being better . " 
homework and jersday 
would like to go back to bed instead of to clinical 
can't wait for this test to be over . 
school till 12 then a ton of homework =) yes . 
Your life is not just about you . Its also about contributing to others . Its about living true to your mission and reason for being here on this earth at this time . Most people are so stuck in their egos that everything revolves around me , me , and more me . But if you want to be < PROPMALE > in the truest sense of the word it can't only be about you . It has to include adding value to other peoples lives . 
leaving work . homework . studying & JERSDAY =) 
can't believe that on this day six years ago I started the journey of a lifetime with the love of my life and best friend . celebrating tonight =) 
making dinner .. getting in my PJ's and doing hours of homework -- real great saturday night . 
I don't do second best . 
You should expect more , you should expect everything . Trust and emotional support , intellectual stimulation . You should expect that he´ll be there for you unconditionally , no matter what you do , no matter what life brings . <3 
cant believe the schedule is made for the fall . bleh . 
I can't wait to spend one day in my bed past 630 in the morning . That would be fabulous . 
Clinical paperwork forever & then it's tee shirt time =) 
Had a great time tonight with my girls =) 
can't wait to get out of work & spend time with my family =) 
People are so classy . 
I've learned that making a living is not the same thing as making a life ... <3 
its not having what you want but wanting what you've got . 
what a gorgeous morning 
Reluctantly setting my clock an hour ahead . 
You can only become truly accomplished at something you love . Don’t make money your goal . Instead pursue the things you love doing and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off of you . 
I want to go on vacation =( 
Finishing touches on the med-surg paper and I've decided I am going to get TJ's for dinner =) 
Writing a paper twice sucks . 
Text me numbers .. new phone . 
studying with the bestiess .. <3 
can't wait to sleep in tomorrow =) 
The top gets higher the more that I climb ... 
layed in bed all day .. guess i should get ready for school now 
life's like an hourglass glued to the table . . .
