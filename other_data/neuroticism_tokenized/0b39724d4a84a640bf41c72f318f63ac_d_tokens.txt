Smelling the wonderful < PROPFEMALE > hickory pork ribs cooking in the oven . Concerned with Talvi . Have to take him to the vet first thing in the morning . Watching < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . 
Relishing children in bed , laughing at the memories from < PROPFEMALE > Photos of < PROPMALE > at a young age , and seeing myself in my children . Its freaky , but expected . 
Talvi is fine , possible necrotic tooth , but at least it's not cancer . THANK GOODNESS .
