is breathing a sigh of relief ...

missing his son and daughter daily ... 
Just got out of traffic and have to get back in it : hair cut time ( after my second shower ) ... 
Just got out of the pool and it feels great ... 
Just saw Towelhead by accident ; whoever wrote this movie is a beast ! Great film ; it will make a lot of people mad ... 
Thinking about the 12 hour drive ahead ... 
is having a great day , cheers !! 
Once again , I had a supreme day . Perhaps , I spoke too early : it isn't over yet . Regardless , it's been pretty good . 
The Universe comes at you indiscriminately . Deal with it . 
Da Bears blew on Sunday . Damn ... turned of game and started Sunday dinner . I am looking forward to the Cavs ' season opener ... 
Good shit over the last week . See you in 2010 and beyond ( you know who you are ) . 
Happy New Year to all my family and friends ... Hope the your new one is better than the last ...

How sweet it is to be loved by me ... 
Sometimes things go your way ... < PROPFEMALE > those moments . 
Start work today ... sort of have mixed feelings because school is now on the backburner ... 
Bagged another interview for Tuesday ... jobs are like women : they don't want you unless you're already taken ... 
Going to and fro in the earth and up and down in ti . 
Looks like the brother nailed another gig ... good two weeks . 
Just bagged a new job . So things are turning around . 
Happy Mother's Day . 
Thanks to all who thought to acknowledge my day ... I'm still walking to and fro on the earth and up and down in it .... The next three days I'm going to be hard to reach ... 
I know everybody's feeling it , but this heat is oppressive . 
Hopefully Kobe and the boys pull it out tonight . 
Happy Friday/long weekend ! 
Hope everyone is getting it in today ... BBQing and enjoying each other ... Stop the violence 
today is my occ day , for those that know

The weekend has begun .

And on the sixth day , He made Privacy < PROPFEMALE > and saw that it was good ... 
Weekend was nice and uneventful . Just lazy < PROPFEMALE > around at home ... I needed that ... 
Cleanliness is next to sexiness ... 
Good Morning all .. 
Privacy < PROPFEMALE > is awesome . 
Pain so deep that it erodes the foundation of love ... 
Half way point of the week now ... Morning and much success to you all .. GO BLACKHAWKS ! 
I'm tired of being preached to by the nuthouse escapees mornings ... They should ask their god for cars ... 
Feels good to be spoiled for the hell of it ... 
Go Hawks !!! 
Morning all ... Damn it feels good to be on the downslope of the week . 
Listening to old Tribe ... 
Red jerseys painting our great city today ... We are the champions !!

Ain't it cool how parties spontaneously come together ? 
Good morning all ! Let us start our work week out rested and relaxed . I know I am ... 
Good day today making the doughnuts . Hopefully this is a preview of the whole week .

Let's go Lakers ! 
I want my dough in clean new boy 50s . You know who you are . Lakers baby .

Happy Father's Day to us all .... A special shout out to those who want but can't have ... Love ! 
Once again , another Wednesday : Halfway over , the week is and hot ! Do your best to beat the 94 degrees that Chicago is getting today . Remember , and it's especially true in the summer , the freaks come out at night .

End of the week people ... be safe and cool

Morning all ! Let the weekend begin with a huge bang . I'm riding ' till the wheels fall off . To my Wolves : Great job this week . Can't ask for nothing more -- or can I ? 
I just wanna be , I just wanna be successful 
Just a thought on my extended weekend : All these boys ( supposedly men ) , who have children and the opportunity to see them , but don't take advantage of it , you will regret it hardcore one day ... The dissappointment in your babies eyes is akin to wells of sorrow . Think about it .

Watching Team USA go at < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Someone literally brought the funk with them today ... Feel like CTA's trying to exterminate me with noxious fumes ... 
Yesterday it was funk , today some unexplained delay ( hours ): it's official-if there is a god , then it is hell bent on making me sleep deprived and generally ill tempered . 
I picked the only carrier that has no coverage in the subway .... Sprint customers should revolt : the bills are high enough 
And so starts the Friday commute : with an early start and hopes of a < PROPFEMALE > finish ... 
Full tank in your Focus : about $34.00 ; Riding the CTA : $84.00 per month . Girl with no gag reflex : Priceless ! 
Kicked Croatia in the ass yesterday ... getting in Slovenia's ass today . GO TEAM USA ! 
Children with special needs do not have an illness & it is not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Can I make a request of anyone ? Are you willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ?

Visceral , ancient , volatile-but only for you . 
Help ! I am sick of getting notices from people from these god's message applications . Do I have to block them to stop it ? 
Nothing better than a long hot shower at 1am 
Four Day Weekend has begun ! 
At Navy Pier with the family ... 
Children's Museum and Bubba Gump's ... nice day 
BBQ with the fam ... Nice . 
Team USA is killing Angola . 
Wasted day spent nursing a throbing head , sore throat , and achy stomach ... 
Time to go bed shopping 
I am now 100% . Too bad the weekend is over . 
Team USA gold medal game today @ 1330cst . 
True Blood in 40 minutes . 
Chillin in downtown chicago listening to a cover band jam 
Now what ? 
Did you ever say damn and meant it ? 
Visceral , ancient , volatile-but only for you ... \ 
Share my hidden wounds , my fragility . \ 
Trusting your discretion ; fearing your betrayal . \ 
I leap ... \ 
Falling , not knowing where I will land , \ 
Only knowing that it was worth it ... \ 
Pain revealed in a flash , \ 
For the pleasures of the present , \ 
And the hope of loyalty . \ 
Will you travel to the end , \ 
Or leave swiftly like the wind ? 
I truly had a perfect day . I can't complain . 
Fresh hair cut on a rainy day . 
Today was a good day , and it's not over . 
I am baking a lasagna tomorrow . just thought I'd put it in the air(something nonpolitical/ non atheist promoting ) . 
The Buick Regal came up : I just saw a new one , it looks nice . 
Babies are in bed ... just read them their stories . Time for dad to relax . 
The older I get , the more the Wife rubs off on me : I'm actually enjoying shopping for beds . 
Boozer hurt already ? WTF ! 
Going to see about meeting Rahm < PROPMALE > . Take care FB .

New look Bulls is looking good against Toronto in tonight's preseason exhibition game . Key word is exhibition and , moreover , Toronto ; however , if this is a preview of the type of play to expect , we're in for a good ride this season .

Had a great time partying with < PROPFEMALE > students last night . 
Lasagna day , with bread and wine . 
First half Heat/Celtics : Heat looks over matched . Despite the talent , the experience of the C's has been overwelming . Stay tuned for the 2nd . 
Enjoying life with my family ! 
New look Bulls look awesome against Portland in the first half . Roughly 6 minutes left to go . 
Boozer's cast comes off by the end of the week ! 
Bulls looking good in the 3rd quarter . Deng is snapping . He's logged 32 so far . At this rate , he may score over 40 tonight . \ 
Of course , don't sleep on Portland ; but , every < PROPFEMALE > has its thorn . 
88-73 as we go into the 4th ; Deng is 2 points from his career high 38 . Bulls are , however , in foul trouble . 
I'm calling this game with 5:36 left in the 4th . At this point : < PROPFEMALE > has 12 asts/15pts ; Deng has 39pts ; Bulls lead 101 - 88 . Nice one . We killed them defensively . 
Memphis vs LAL in 15 minutes . 
The day after the election , and the mood on the street in Chicago is sour . Disappointment in the election result . Oh well . 
Back in the D ... 
This may be anecdotal , but over 70 degrees in November in Chicago and Detroit metro indicates some validity to global warming to me . Although memory cannot serve as evidence , I seriously can't remember this ever occuring at this frequency growing up .

I'm getting junk mail advertising a seminary class . Should I go ? 
Five easy payments of $38.00 . NBA League Pass ; should I indulge myself ? 
Decision made . NBA League Pass here I come . My wife won't let me watch the game . She's made the decision for me . Maybe she should pay for it . 
< PROPFEMALE > Stiles and < PROPFIRST > Weller are awesome this year on < PROPMALE > . 
Kudos to science for one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century , the electric toothbrush . 
Very good day today . Kids are just slightly destructive , and I had no < PROPMALE > blow ups . Pretty good . 
Contrarians are just as cancerous as fundamentalists . \

First game of the Circus Trip turns out good for Chicago against < PROPMALE > . They put the Rockets away 95 to 92 in a hard fought victory in which < PROPFEMALE > carried his squad on his back in the fourth quarter . Unfortunately , dark days lie ahead : San < PROPFIRST > tomorrow night and < PROPFIRST > on Friday . \ 
Till then . 
Gonna be a good night for your boy . I get to watch the Heat go at the Suns in about 90 minutes , then the Bulls at the Spurs right afterwards . The kids are going to bed early . 
Game time ! 
Don't think I'm gonna finish the Heat/Suns game . Miami killed these guys . Maybe there will be a miracle in the 4th quarter . Doubtful . 
Game two of the Circus Trip . Since 1998 , they have been unable to win more than three games on the annual road trip through the West . After last night's victory against < PROPMALE > , they take on < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and the Spurs . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , short new acquisition < PROPFIRST > Boozer and weak at the two , will need to limit turnovers and take over at clutch time ; Deng , Gibson , < PROPMALE > , and the bench will need a solid night . 
Da Bulls go down in flames . They looked good in the first half , but fell apart in the 3rd . When the 4th came around , the hole proved too deep for Chicago . San < PROPFIRST > with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and Old Reliable , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , can do that . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > and the crew go 6-4 for the season and will have a virtually guaranteed loss coming Friday against < PROPFIRST > . With their 103-94 victory , the Spurs record stands at 9-1 . 
Baby I'm scared of you . I don't believe in magic , I believe , I believe in love everlasting .... 
Daddies and donuts at my girl's school today . Coffee with a bunch of children , their teachers , and other dads . Hopefully SHE enjoys it . 
Yes . I purchased the League Pass . Don't know why I took so long to decide . Now I can waste my life away posting on FB AND watching the NBA . Heaven ! 
Anyone see < PROPFIRST > Beasley reject Kobe last night ? That was some cool shit . 
Why is shopping for beds so @&*(^&# frustrating ?! 
< PROPMALE > just blocked Bron's shit in crunch time . 40 seconds left ; Memphis 95/Miami 90 . 
Boston at Toronto : is it even worth watching ? 
Heat falls to the Pacers in Miami ! Indiana up 16 with 2 minutes to go !

Miami drops third game in a row to < PROPMALE > . Less than one minute to go , 100-92 , and there are no miracles ... 
Suns suffer a gut wrenching loss ( 123-115 ) in double ot to the Bulls , who , after coming off a loss last night to the Lakers , crawl back from a 23 point deficit and go up 3-2 on their annual circus trip . Phoenix fails to go above . 500 , and the Bulls have good cards to finish their two week road trip through the West better than they have since < PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > . Sweet . 
Happy Thanksgiving . I'm thankful for my family , science , reason , and logic . Good day ! 
Hoping < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ( neck spasms ) can play tonight against < PROPMALE > . 
No children today . Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat ! 
likes Boardwalk Empire , but for a town that is 40% black , it's kinda light . The production value is through the roof ; how much more would it have cost to hire black extras ? 
Miami challenges < PROPFIRST > at home tonight . Your thoughts ? 
I'm calling this one in the third : Heat drops game to Mavs at American Airlines Center . Chandler , Nowitski , Kid , < PROPFIRST > , etc are giving them the business ; 2:00 left , Heat has two time outs remaining , the Mavs 5 . The Heats defense has been poor , their offense stagnant . Lebron ineffective , < PROPMALE > neutralized ; the supporting staff looks like D-League pick ups . Something is rotten in South Beach . 76-59 . 
106-95 . Heat loses the fourth game out of the last five in < PROPFIRST > . 
And they did it . For the first time since 1998 , the Bulls finish the circus trip with a winning record , 4-3 . 96-85 is the final against the Kings . \ 
Rumor has it that Boozer will be playing within one week . Hopefully , it's true because the schedule doesn't get any easier . 
loves Kobe < PROPMALE > because he has won me lots of money over the years from irrational Kobe haters . 
It's a shame that the majority are rarely guilty of excessive critical thought . 
Boardwalk is hilarious tonight . The prohibition enforcement agent just drowned another agent , who happened to be Jewish , performing a baptism in front of a black congregation . LMAO ! 
Washington challenges Miami at American Airlines Arena . With all the talk about the Heat's woes , the team has a lot to prove . They cannot possibly stand to lose to a sub . 500 team after losing four out of their last five . I don't think they will , but they've disappointed frequently this year . Heat fans are surely holding their breath . 
Creationist arguments serve as proof that humanity shares a common ancestor with apes because it amounts to throwing an inordinate amount of shit against the wall in hopes that some will stick . -Shoeresh Coppage 
Lebron did nothing more than choosing to work for another employer . It's his career . All the general nastiness his actions off season has generated is ridiculous and exhibits extreme stupidity . Get a life people ! All the shit going on in the world , and you dim wits are up in arms about a man making his own career decisions . I hope the Heat grinds the Cavaliers into the ground then scrapes them off like dog shit . 
Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec 6 ) there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories and smiles . This is for a campaign against violence against children .

is really enjoying the Bulls/Thunder game . 
Bulls take down the Lakers for the first time since 12/06 . The only player on the roster then ? Luol Deng . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > score their first victory against the world champs . Go Bulls ! 
Watching the Clippers climb back from 25 down against soft ass < PROPMALE > . If LAC would stop shooting long balls and attack the rim , they'd beat these guys . It's not over , they have 8 minutes left in the 4th and have cut the lead to 8 ; and , < PROPMALE>'s in foul trouble .

Ready to watch Ice Cold D-Rose , aka Poohdini do the damn thing at the All-Star Game . Ya dig ? 
Cavs take out the Knicks , Melo fouls out at clutch time . 
New York at Miami ; tip off moments away . 
the Knicks/Heat game just got real good going into half time . 
Knicks out away the Heat . What a game ! 
So my new bedroom set will be here in a few days ; the kids have already colored on their new furniture ; and I derived pleasure from buying towels , a really cool iron and ironing board . \ 
A thrill a minute . \ 
What have I become ? 
< PROPMALE > just came back from being down 24 pts and put the Heat away in Miami . Awesome game . 
Great night for Bulls fans : They take out the Magic decisively at home . When do the talking heads shut the fuck up and give our boys their props ? \ 
On another note : Chicago has Miami again on Sunday ( by the way they have already one the season series by two games ) , but it looks like the Spurs want to spank that ass first-first quarter blow out , 36-12 . 
ESPN commentators must be blowing LeBron , < PROPMALE > , and Bosh . They're down by damn near 30 in the 4th , have only beaten one elite team this year , yet these guys are still fawning over the Heat . 
Heat fall to the Spurs by 30 . 
Not a game that anyone cares about , but New jersey and Toronto just started a triple overtime . 
If you were buying expensive concert tickers ( within the first ten rows ) , who would you pick : < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > Legend or Usher ? 
Getting ready for the Bulls/Heat game at 1:00 EST . Coach Thibs says it's just another game , but a victory today would go a long way to solidify Chicago as the second seed . You know the Three Musketeers and crew are going to come out hard considering they've lost four of the last five . I hear that Bosh will play the five and LeBron is going to play the four . \ 
Good luck Chicago ! 
Bulls sweep the season series against the Heat ! See ya ' in the post season player . Yeah ! 
Heat fall down to Trailblazers ! 
More crying in the lockerroom , Heat have lost five out of the last six . 
Heat pull it off at home and take out the Lakers .

Celtics fall down at home to the Grizzlies in a nail biter . Or maybe they're saving themselves for the playoffs ? In any case , Chicago now sits atop the East a full game ahead of Boston . 
Knicks crash and burn at home against the lowly Bucks . Will there be any weeping in the locker room ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > thought that he and his boys could come in < PROPFEMALE>'s house and take one . Not today baby . Ice Cold D- < PROPFEMALE > put that shit down . Bulls lead the Celtics by 2 games for the top spot in the East . 
The Grizz just put down the Spurs convincingly . 
Boston falls to Indiana . 
Lakers just punked < PROPFIRST > . Good game . 
20 minutes left at work , and off tomorrow . Good times ! 
Watching the American \Death at a Funeral\ " again . Hilarious ! "
