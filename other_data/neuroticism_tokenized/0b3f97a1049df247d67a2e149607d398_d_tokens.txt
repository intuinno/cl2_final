So This is what my college schedule officially looks like :\ 
General Chemistry Lecture/Lab\ 
Intro to Computer Science\ 
Advanced Writing for Professionals\ 
Communicating in French I Lecture/Lab ( don't know what that lab's about ... )\ 
Calculus I\ 
Intro to Physics\ 
At least this is it pending my AP scores coming in the next month or so . \ 
18 hours total . 
:) My summer is going pretty well ... I've got a job at Copeland , working 12 hours a day =P Lotsa stuff to do in preparation for college , and applying for those last minute scholarships . So its been pretty busy . My sister has come to that age where she wants to go everywhere , but can't drive yet , and soon I'll be off to college . 
So its really a summer of expectations , I suppose : expecting my next paycheck , expecting to be very busy , and expecting my life to change in every way as I attend college :) Sounds exciting ! 
Just got my AP score reports . \ 
Calculus earned a surprising 4\ 
and\ 
Statistics earned a full 5 ! ( Yay Mr. Maskey ! ) 
I leave Wednesday for St. < PROPFIRST > 
I made it through the first days of classes . No trouble with anything , I know like the first half of my calculus class , My French class is by far the hardest ; I walk in and the professor is only speaking French , and this is the lowest level , just a bit intimidating is all :) Oddly enough ( I'm a physics < PROPMALE > ) my English teacher is my favorite so far . Weird huh ? 
Whooo ! graffiti party ! \ 
Black light with phosphorescent highlighters ! 
Just got back from my acapella audition ; I asked how I did , and they said I did pretty good ! Woohoo ! I could become part of Astha ACapella ! \ 
They said they'd let me know by the weekend , I'm so pumped to find out ^ ? ^ 
I was not accepted into the acapella group . Oh well , better luck next time :)
