trying to figure all these new buttons out 

yay , i finally got a new phone 
one more midnight shift and then 2 days off 
need new books 
i suppose i should start checking this more often 
where did the strange cough come from ? 
i really hate sunburn , why can we invent all kinds of technological wonders , yet we have no sunburn-b-gone invented ? 
work work work , i need to go see < PROPFIRST > pilgrim vs the world , and hopefully no more strange work drama that comes outta nowhere . only drama im asking for please 
finally off . one more night shift ( hopefully not rainy ) and then a day off 
roll the windows down , turn the radio up , and lets go 
people create such drama on these social sites , is it really worth it ? it will never make sense to me 
really great when people just decide what your going to do after work , then when you don't want to go with their plan when your not comfortable with it , they want to guilt trip you . thanks a bunch 
thank you at&t , for not listening to me . for wasteing my daytime minutes , and claiming its my fault when its clearly your technicians . and for telling me to call back in 3 hours . it will not be a nice conversation in 3 hours 
lets hope they can handle the girls till i get back 
why do they giggle about everything ? 
why sea turtles ? it doesn't make sense but its funny 
the way the clouds are moving fast in front of the < PROPFEMALE > looks just like a horror movie 
sometimes family makes it really hard to like them , or deal with them 
hyper + no < PROPFIRST > = HORRIBLENESS . im not even sure thats a word , but it is now . my phone has been quiet for to long , don't you love me friends ? a friend ( me ) in need is a friend(me again ) indeed right ? you know im not even totally sure what that means 
stupid theatres never have what you want

why does it seem like half the people out here can't change a tire ? 
today is definetly not going as planned 
some people just don't understand plain english . maybe i should speak ebonics ? spelled right ? who cares . maybe ill try using card board signs ? maybe im just not using enough text lingo ? 
well im pretty sure of how to do my job , still really no training besides ims . and im already having to train someone ? gotta love the walmart way 
im sorry but im not wearing a pink shirt , can everyone please stop asking me ? 
soooo haunted house maybe tomorrow night ? if everything works out and god willing this time 
well had fun at the haunted house , still kinda bummed we couldn't get together more people . i think < PROPFEMALE > got less scared than my friend tho . all in all it was a good night but in a bummed mood 
just love getting in trouble for actually working , sometimes this place really knows how to push it and then they wanna know why everyone thinks about leaving 
just hanging out in mesquite at the PrimaCare clinic 
i don't like riding with people that can't drive in a straight line . scares me to death when they are all over the road 
to much to think about 
can't wait for the 2 days off . gotta figure out what to do about everything and i wanna go do something 
im thankful for my friends and family that put up with me and accept my strengths and faults.im thankful they put up with my attitudes , my stubborness , my moods , my opinions that are usually really extreme . im thankful they know im there if they need an ear , a helping hand , a shoulder , an extra head , or any other body part . and im thankful for everytime they were their for me 
hard enough to save up money and now i make more but less hours ? and smaller check . how wonderful 
had fun , now im all hyped up and still want to do something . feel like doing something or just driving 
tired of the way this store is run 
well went to the viewing , funerals tomorrow 
well the day is said and done , means time for food and a walk . what sounds good for dinner ? because all im drawing is blanks 
TRUE friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what name brand you wear , if your house is a mess where you live , about your past , or if your family is filled with craziness . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking bu ..... never question the friendship . Re-pos this if you have at least one true friend , they will know who they a 
jamming out to music while cleaning is the only way to clean 
well late night drive around < PROPFIRST > , and now ive been to poetry , texas . if yoy can call that a town 
life gets better right ? just love people hinting that i did something that i didn't 
whats something you want to do before you die ? that thing that would make you feel like you fulfilled some divine purpose ? i want to change as many lives as i can . and write a book . be someone that can do something no matter what 
really ?? are they asleep ? tuckered out and tucked in ? THEY HAVE OFF SWITCHES ? 
32 hours and no sleep and 4 more hours of work . I CAN DO IT ! as long as i stay outta the pillow aisle . i wanna go home and play with my camera 
you haven't been there so you don't get it and no you don't \understand\ " so why even say it ? " 
driving myself crazy , thought i had this figured out already 
i think im going to write the definition of \mine\ " on the fridge in permanent marker and see if that doesn't get people to stop eating or drinking MY stuff " 
just not into any of it today , just off 
hate people that say they are your friends but aren't 
words could not describe 
yea that makes sense , i mean she does nothing anyway so instead or making her do something .... they instead try to make my friends do the chores , and they wonder why i hate being at home with them 
at&t was so nice as to suspend my phone today . i told them over the phone the other day that payday was THURSDAY and i would pay in full . so they leave a msg saying i didn't pay by TUESDAY like i said and my phone is suspended ... oh joy . at least tomorrow is payday and should get it turned back on . only funny part today was my cell phone < PROPMALE > is literally 666.668 ... am i the only one seeing the evil number ? 
so if my head explodes from this headache does my insurance cover it ? 
christmas in january :) 
i wanna rule the world 
i know how a brain freeze happens and yet it still happens to me no matter what i do to stop it . i think icecream is secretly evil 
had a blast today , alot of fun . almost walked off a huge step tho 
trying hard at customer service , i think they stuck a sign on me that says \ask me all the hard questions\ " tho " 
feeling old , only 10:40 and falling asleep
