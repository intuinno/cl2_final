My cockatiel just flew away ... I'm devastated ... 
Crap , I'm in trouble ... and I'm gonna go outside today for once lol . Amazing I'm still tan . 
Right so , I've decided what I want to do . I want to be a research psychologist . * throws confetti * 
Ew , Facebook changed it's layout . This is starting to feel like Gaia all over again . 
RIP My baby cockatiel Shadow . I'm the only one mourning her passing . I guess I'm the only one who got emotionally attached to her . 
I just finished watching The Lovely Bones . It's very bittersweet , but I liked it nonetheless . = w = 
I'm so bored . I need something to doooooooooo adfnaefnrugreangl ~ !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
If you don't watch Archer ... then you should . <3 <3 <3 
My favorite word ever : \Doppleganger\ " . What's yours ? " 
I totally just lied to my mom . And I had no reason to do it . x.X I wonder if it's normal to have lied before and gotten used to it that you do it impulsively . 
Squirrel Tail ! 
Don't you hate it when someone nags you to do something and then when you comply , they say \thank you !!! <3333 \ " like you're best friends ? I'm about to cut someone . :/ " 
Ew , my eye is all red . I think it's allergies . I didn't even know I had allergies . > n < 
I never really noticed this before ... but it's fun to kill my Sims . > u > Just sayin ' . 
I wake up this morning and my mouth tastes like blood . D: My face just doesn't like me nowadays . 
You . Yes you . Play Robot Unicorn Attack . Now . ALWAYS I WANT TO BE WITH YOU AND MAKE BELIEVE WITH YOU ~ !!! 
Back from < PROPFEMALE>'s party and my eyes feel like they're going to implode . So I take it I'm getting allergic to cats now . > n < ;; 
So since < PROPFEMALE > always get mad at me for leaving right after I post here , I'm gonna stay online until I have to sleep . Let's see if she gets her ass online and tries to talk to me > u > 
So tomorrow I'll be at school at around 11 AM and staying until 3 PM . If anyone wants to meet up with me , I'll be in the cafeteria at 12:45 . c : 
I'm so mad right now ... I could murder someone . I'm serious . * fumes * 
Poo Face <3 
Woke up at 5:30 this morning . Fell asleep in Yoga class 4 hours later . > n > ;;; I am so cool ~ 
is Lactose Intolerant . 
Have you ever listened to music one day and realized that it's going incredibly slow ? Or that it's going incredibly fast ? Trippy ... 
lol an earthquake . I was sitting in the car waiting for my mom while at the same time , people are running out of Barnes and Nobel with unpaid books . My mom clearly flipped out . 
Yum , Krispy Kreme doughnuts ~ <3 
How do you comfort a suicidal friend that lives hundreds of < PROPMALE > away ? 
The answer was so simple , I was too smart to see it !!

That feeling of being stabbed in the heart ... it's back ... 
It needs to be Saturday right now . > / 
lol so like , 5 minutes ago my dogs were barking like crazy . Since they wouldn't shut up , I decided to go out and see what the hell they were doing . I open the front door and these three guys run past our house , followed by a cop and two cop cars . Apparently they jumped my neighbors fence just before taking off . Don't know what they did yet . 
So every Friday for the past 5 weeks , I've been getting this pain in my mid back and chest . It's sort of a mix between having an air bubble inside you and having achy muscles that make it hard to breathe . > n > I don't feel it inside , so maybe it's my muscles but I don't know what it could be . The feeling stays for about a half an hour and then it disappears . It's bizarre ... 
Health Update : Went to the hospital last night at around 12:30 . My back and chest were hurting so much , I couldn't even lie down and sleep properly . After a few X-Rays they determined it was an esophogial reflux . A mix between Esophogial Spasam and Acid Reflux . Owie > w < But I'm all better . Yum , 400 mg of Motrin ~ 
Why is it that afternoon naps dreams are more fucked up that normal night time dreams ? Either way , I don't think I'm ever going to nap again . 
I hate not being able to vent . 
You know , when you start to have dreams about being stuck in an elevator that free falling 20 stories , it's really no wonder why you'd be afraid of them . 
Are these not glass ? * smashes * Oh , they are . 
I officially hate having high hopes . 
So these two Asian kids try to break into my dad's car again . When I catch them in the act , the girl runs off and escapes . I manage to catch the guy and put him in a choke hold until he passes out . Ah , the excitment of dreams ~ 
Maybe it's just me ... but Google has been acting retarded all day . It takes me like , seven or eight tries in order for me to click a link and actually go to the correct < PROPFEMALE > . > / 
If the world was an old woman , the US would be her dementia . 
So my mom is letting me try out texting this month and enabled it on my phone today . Just sayin . > w > 
Why is it my MP3 manages to play every single fucking sad song when I'm depressed ?! D < 
So my mom thinks it's hilarious to burn like , a billion sticks of insence and make it look like we live in a pot house . Way to go mom . Did you forget I also have some ASTHMA ? D < 
I think ... I really fucked things over for myself ... 
Note to Self : Don't Ever Become A Counselor 
So a man goes to Mexico and finds a pretty lady there . They sleep together and soon afterwards , he leaves her to go back to the US . Many years later he comes back to Mexico , finds another woman and starts to date her . Here's the catch ; this new woman is his daughter from the previous lady . And he gets her pregnant . 
I hate this fucking place . 
So I'm doing this paper for one of my classes and our teacher is encouraging us to use references from our book and then to list what we used on a Reference < PROPFEMALE > at the end . I'm an idiot though , so I can't figure out how to do that . > n > Can anyone help ? 
Turned in my Observational Research Paper today . Would have turned in my test too , except I forgot it at home . So I have to do that on Wed . > n < Well at least the week is almost over ! 8D Oh yeah , I also saw Mr. Kammerer on Thurs . He got fat lol 
Did I forget to mention how much I LOATHE stubborn people ? Well I do . 
So lets say you have a white pitbull with brown spots all over . What would you name her ? 
If sex is supposed to make you feel good and relax , why do some people need to smoke afterwards ? 
Pacman 30th Anniversary ! wooka wooka wooka wooka wooka ~ 
Went to the eye doctor today . I got my eyes dilated today and since I'm near sighted , that makes me completely blind for the whole day . My doctor also told me that since my prescription is so strong ( fail ? ) that it would be in my best interest to start wearing contacts . What do you think ? 
\He touched my hand . That means we're engaged . \"" 
I do all of my work , get an A on all of my tests , worked my ASS off on my final project , and I get an F in the class ? WHAT THE FUCK ? 
So I emailed my psychology teacher today ( like i said before lol ) and he responded a few minutes ago . He says it was definitely a mistake and that my grade on his rescord was indeed an \A\ " so he's gonna make sure he changes it . I am so fucking happy right now ! > w < " 
Is there a book about be lonely ? 
This is one of those days where I wonder what my results would be if I had a psychiactric evaluation ... probably not good . > n > 
If women win 99.9% of all fights , how many fights do they win if all their fights are against another woman ? 
Why the hell does my house smell like tangy pizza ? i'm the only one here and i haven't cooked anything . creepy ~ 
\There are big changes for you 
Do professionals ever follow their own practice ? If that's so , why do some dentists have missing or gold teeth and barbers have bad hair ? And how about people who work for cellphone companies ? Would they get fired if they personally used a rival service ? 
There's been a lot of little earthquakes recently ... maybe it's an omen ? > u > ;;; \ 
If it is , then it'd better wait until after I see < PROPMALE > Gaffigan . He'll be the first comedian I see live and I do NOT want to die before it , damnit ! 
Really dad ? You're going to throw a tantrum over a problem that is literally nonexistent and you're going to take your youngest daughter down with you ? How the hell does that make any sense whatsoever ? 
i hate sitting here in the middle of the night and all of a sudden , i start to hear weird noises that won't go away . 
just spent the past 45 minutes sharpening 12 pencils with an old < PROPMALE > sharpener i found . now it looks like my fingers have frostbite . i'm so hardcore . <3 
Is it really THAT weird to pour your milk before the cereal ? > n > ;;

Just saw Toy Story 3 . Amazing ! D: 
\How deep is your love ? I really need to learn . ' Cause we're livin ' in a world of fools 
Jeez , it's like the fires of Hell decided to take a vacation in my house . = n = 
Mom just told me she's thinking about canceling the internet at our house . :/ \ 
\ 
My dad would drop kick her because he needs it for school like me . So he'd never let it happen . It's just irritating to hear her say \well I don't need it so I'll cancel it . \ " Seriously ? You're just mad because you can't even figure out how to turn it on . " 
Nilla Waffers as so addictive . D: 
So ... we have no working plumbing . wth . 
My mother is counting down the years until she gets to divorce my dad . > n > 
Today was an interesting day . My english teacher compared us to sausage links and described how the smart kids have big openings so he can stuff all the fat and cholesteral in , while the dumb kids have small openings in which he couldn't stuff as much . \ 
... yeah . 
Go for the gold Germany . You're gonna win it this year ~ \

Dreams are to lovers as wine is to friends\ 
Carried through \ 
lifetimes and spilled now and then\ 
Gotta love Ratatouille ;D 
So Comic Con had a few unexpected visitors today . A small group of Hardcore Christians protesting the convention . Sure you can believe whatever you want and you can have non violent protests all you want . But when you do it at a place where you're severely outnumbered and no one cares , really all you want is publicity . And you've run out of things to protest that would have made sense otherwise . :/ 
Synchronize watches ! Synchronize fist pump ! Synchronized driving ! 
So my birthday is in 5 days , but my mom wants me to do something this weekend . She suggested I throw a gringo mexican party . You're invited < PROPFEMALE > . xD 
thinks Soup Plantation made her sick . xP 
Aww , i love all of you too ~ I can already feel myself getting carpel tunnel in my thumbs xD 
So my brother came to my room and gave me a pretty heavy shoe box about a half an hour ago and said I could keep it . When I opened it up , I found at least 200 Pokemon cards in it . I'm definitely gonna need another folder to arrange them all . D: 
So the weirdest thing happened yesterday . My brother caught a cockatiel that was flying around in our backyard and we put the bird in a cage to check it and see if it was okay . Obviously the bird had to of belonged to someone . But after staring at it for a long time , we're convinced it's my cockatiel that flew away earlier this year . How's that for a round trip ? xD 
I want to own an owl now ~ = w = 
Got a tooth filling today . Still have one left that I'm gonna do later . Half my mouth is still numb and I probably cried more than I should have . I can't help that I'm deathly afraid of needles though . > n > ;;; Didn't help that I had to get shot twice . Got a Jamba Juice though lol ~ 
You could have at least told me that silver fillings have some mercury in them before you put them in ! Dx 
Does anyone know any good thrift stores around here ? I'm looking for cheap stuff to make my halloween costume . For funsies , because I've never made a costume for myself . > w < Don't judge me ! 
Anyone hear about that story of the man who's house burned down while firefighters watched because he didn't pay for the $75 it costs to have their service ? WTF what's wrong with people these days ? What if someone was trapped in the house ? What if it exploded and killed innocent people ? I didn't even know there was places where you had to pay upfront for stuff like that ... 
I feel so weird today . Like I'm out of place here and a little nostalgic . \ 
... \ 
Maybe it's just gas . > n > 
i'm really worried . Our pitbull ran into our little dog the other day and he got hurt . He won't walk on his left leg and it's sticking out at a bit of an < PROPFEMALE > . It can bend still and straighten out without him crying , so I think he might have just dislocated it . But my parents are a little hesitant to take him to the vet because of cost . They will eventually . But what can I do for him in the mean time ? 
wow .... talk about total < PROPFEMALE > vu . 
Chicken and Coupon Guy were so totally in love . 
My sister made me watch Paranormal Activity 2 with her today . I probably would have found it a < PROPFEMALE > bit more suspensful if we didn't watch it IN THE DAY , in the LIVING ROOM with PEOPLE TALKING in the KITCHEN NEXT TO US . \ 
Still wish I made a costume * sobsob * 
\Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up ! \ " \ 
Why is today being so mean to me ? I didn't do anything except wake up this morning . ; 3 ; 
Don't you hate it when you wake up all nice and cozy in your bed , then the second you move you suddenly feel like you're in Alaska ? I'm surprised I don't have frostbite ; 3 ; 
RIP my poor tongue . After being burtally murdered by a drop of pure rubbing alcohol disguised as wine , I don't think I'll be able to taste anything for a year lolz . Great parenting mom and dad . 
Why are you doing this to me MSN ?! Dx * headdesk * 
I just found out today that a class friend of mine has my first name as her middle name and my middle name as her first . I feel so awesome right now . <3 
Crap , I think I'm getting sick . DON'T BETRAY ME LIKE THIS , BODY ! Dx What about all the things I've done for you ? All the snacks I consumed ? All the sodas I drank ? DOES THAT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU ANYMORE ?! 
\She's small and cute and she's always there . She's a shoe . \ " - My brother . Talking about me . B/ " 
Yay I got a new lightbulb ! My room doesn't look yellow anymore ! > w < And I can seeeeeee ~ 
Cats and dogs need to stop raining all over my house . We have more than enough of them already D < 
A few relatives stopped by for a visit today . My Little Aunt has gotten very awesome since the last time I saw her . Especially for someone still in Highschool lol . 
Got my sister addicted to Supernatural . I haven't decided yet if that's a good thing or bad thing . > n > ;;; 
< PROPMALE > can be a scary language . Someone could be across the street , yelling \I love you ! I brought you these flowers ! \ " at me and I would crap my pants . " 
You know if I were to die right now , in some sort of firey explosion due to the carelessness of a friend , well , that'll just be okay . :D 
It's an epidemic . My sister , mom and brother are all in the living room watching Supernatural . What the hell . 
Whoever studied the human body must have loved apples . < PROPFIRST>'s apple , the apple of your cheeks , the apple of your eye ... apple bottom jeans , boots with the fur ~ 
i want you to make me feel like i'm the only girl in the world ... god , someone shoot me now please > n > i can't get that song out of my head 
Nothing is as awkward as trying to avoid explaining to your dad why \buck futter\ " is funny . >> ;;;" 
Thanks Call of Duty . You're the first game I ever stopped playing after I threw down the controller and yelled \Stop yelling at me !!! Dx\ " at the tv . I hope you enjoyed those 5 minutes because we're through . " 
Having a very 90's and early 2000's music night . = w = Ah , nostalgia ~ 
Last night I dreamt of a giant octopus wanting to take over the world while my family and I searched for clues in order to stop him and my friend < PROPFIRST > a penguin to distract me . This is what I get for eating a whole box of chocolate covered wafers before bed . > n > 
why must you hurt me , wisdom tooth ? ; n ; 
fufufu ~ i love this new pirate speak setting . > u o 
Tomorrow I get to wake up at the buttcrack of < PROPFEMALE > to see a surgeon about getting my wisdom teeth pulled out . The sooner it happens , the sooner I get to go on a Frozen Yogurt diet . |3 
After watching SNL Celebrity Jeopardy all day , you can't help but giggle when you watch normal Jeopardy the next night . Oh , and I'm eating a big bowl of jell-o now . yum-o ~ 
6 hours and 10 minutes until the new episode of archeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer ~ !!!! 
Yuck , I'm starting to get sick . I'm actually surprised it took this long , considering I've been in the house this whole week with my sick sister . 
random sickness thought : when i was about 8 or something , i remember one day i was drawing a picture and i made the sky too small and the grass too big . so i flipped it , losing sleep over the fact that someone would find out i screwed up . \ 
i don't remember what else i < PROPFIRST > on it . i also don't know why i flipped it . lol 
What does the internet do to people your age ? I always manage to make friends with younger people , get creeped out by older people and loathe everyone my age that isn't related to me . I dunno ... I'm tired lolz 
beat my first game of mindsweeper !!! it's not a big accomplishment , but for those three seconds , i felt like a real bomb difuser . <333 i'm such a nerd . xP 
Looks like Pucky had a slipped disc . Luckily the pain medication seems to be working . Let's hope that and rest is all he needs to recover . n_n 
Scenario 1 :\ 
\What do you have to say for yourself ? \ " \
