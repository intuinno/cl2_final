What you did was very spiteful , but it was also very brave and very honest and I respect you for doing that . But the content of what you said has made me hate you . So there's a layer of respect , admittedly , for your truthfulness , but it's peppered with hate . Hateful respect . 
Oh you evil basturd .

I'm simply one hell of a butler . 
Your fight for survival -- starts right now .
