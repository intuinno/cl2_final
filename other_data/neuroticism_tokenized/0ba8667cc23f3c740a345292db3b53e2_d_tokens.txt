Dear dad , it's super sweet you come into my room every morning to say goodmorning , but when you leave , can you close the door ? It wasn't open when you came in . What makes you think I want it open when you walk out . 
Great . The lights went out at my place . \

Goodnight F.B. 
Babysitting on a Friday night . How sad is that ? \ 
Pretty irritated . Have some respect , you're old enough to know what that is . 
Today seriously took my breath away . \ 
I don't remember the last time I smiled so much in one day . 
I think it might be official . \ 
All that's left is to speak up . 
Ehh , so close . Whatever . \ 
Wasn't as bad as I thought . 
Wow . What lovely information . \ 
This changes everythingg . \ 
whackk . \ 
Grades just ruined my plans for the rest of the week . Hopefully mom will get over it by the time Friday comes alongg . 
I don't think I've ever been this frustrated and angry beforee . I just want it to be Wednesday after school already . 
Seriously ! We just got assigned this project Monday and it's already due tomorroww ! \ 
And I'm the one that has to make the poster . \ 
My partners are going to kill me .

Universal Studios Hollywood Grinchmas . <3 \

Last time I fall for that shit againn . \ 
Bitches . <3 
This kid makes my night every day . \ 
The shit he says . <3 \

Got time to think about it . \ 
I'm 3 years ahead , but I'm readyy . \ 
So longg . \ 
It all started with a kiss . \ 
Great dayy <3 
So on whatever TV show you watch , haven't you ever seen that the main character getting annoyed by the new kid or a neighbor ? Always talking to them , eating their food , etc . So I had annoying neighbors in my dream last night . Ahaha . Shit sucked . 
I pretty much wasted my time on a lost cost . \ 
Never letting that happen againn . 
Perfume commercials are so stupidd . 
My mood ring is malfunctioning . \ 
Yo soy tu peor pesadilla . \ 
(: 
I forgot how much of a trip Sesame Street is . \ 
Ahaha .

These late night phone calls are getting rather amusing . \

-__________- 
I'm ready for 2011 . \ 
New . New . New . New . New . 
A little nervous . 
\Ohygod 
My mom reminds me of an angry chihuahua . 
School . No bueno . 
So long Riversidee . \ 
I love ordering things online . I get all excited when it finally comes in the mail and I see that big package with my name on it . \ 
Boy Meets World . <3 
Found pictures from freshmen/sophmore year on my old laptop . What happened ? 
< PROPMALE > Barnes made my night . (: \ 
Thanks kidd . 
Mom made a facebook . Still deciding if I want to approve her request or not . \ 
I wish essays wrote themselves . 
Can you say late start ? <3 \ 
I've been looking forward to this day all week . 
I find it funny how people who have nothing to do with a certain situation do nothing but stick their big noses in it . Don't come to conclusions until you know the whole story , which in this case you'll never know because it's beyond history already . So STFU . 
A nightmare has to be pretty bad if it scared you so much that you woke up this early and refuse to go to back to bed . 
Spent my day babysitting . <3 \ 
If it were any other kids I would be pretty irritated . But who can be irritated when babysitting the most adorable twins in the world . \ 
Watching Hannibal Rising . <3 \ 
I'm in love . 
)': \ 
Not even a day and I already miss themm . 
Forever is apparently very short these days . 
A part of me wants to go out tomorrow . However the other part just wants to lay in bed all day and listen to music . \ 
Just haven't been in the best mood . 
My sister is funny . Stupid . but funny . 
I love the intense hair do's in the movie The Grinch . <3 
Had a good cup of coffee with my folks . \ 
It really is quite around the house these days . & to think this is what I wanted months ago . I was so wrong . 
Either there is no school Monday or it's another ditching day for me . \ 
Either way , my friend has already made plans for the day . \ 
My mom is too funny . She talks on the phone while driving and if she see's a cop she slowly puts the phone down and makes eye contact as if she's not doing anything wrong . Great influence mother . <3 
Working on yearbook pages . Stressing out . 
< PROPFIRST>'s day is just around the corner and it only makes sense that my parents talk to me about relationships . My dad talked about how back in his day he respected women . Now he see's couples these days and he says , and I quote , \Guys are touching girls < PROPFEMALE>'s and are just so disrespectful\ " \ 
Great napp . Haven't had one of those in awhile . \ 
Things that bother you currently , honestly wont matter anymore in a couple of months . So why are you acting as if it's the end of the world ? \ 
Trust me . I bet there are far more important things that you should be worried about . However , you wont even give it the time of day . 
K : \Aren't I the nicest person you've ever met ? \ " \ 
Okay . It's official , my mother has lost her mind . It's time to put her in a home . 
I'm surprised to see that no one has posted something depressing on facebook . \ 
That's uncommon . 
I have the best timing E V E R . \ 
I keep up with people's birthdays by looking at the side of my homepage . <3 
Saw The Green Hornet . \ 
Loved it , ahaha 
I can see into the future . & in my future I see myself staying up late working on pointless homework . \ 
Beetle Juice , Beetle Juice , Beetle Juice . 
Beiber Black ? Did I seriously just hear that correctly ? Wtf . 
Your selfish acts amuse me . 
I just got up from my nap , & I don't think I've ever woken up so confused before in my lifee . Ahaha . 
Just drove by the old middle school & all the kids were out of class . I don't ever remember being as small as them . 
Just saw my Algebra 2 teacher at Walmart . Classic . 
You're not trying . So why should I ? \ 
You did this to yourself . 
Telling me that you just finished working out is not going to impress me . Just makes you look desperate . I'm not interested , so stop trying . I just want a simple conversation & a friend . Nothing more . 
I was dreaming that my mom was yelling at me . I woke and my mom started yelling at me . Some dreams do come true . 
Had fun todayy . \ 
I could go for a caramel brulée latte . 
Watching Mamma Mia . I can't help but to sing along to the songs . 
\What Women Want\ " \ 
I can say my alphabet backwards . <3 
Someone should buy me , \The Outsiders\ " \ 
< PROPMALE > . < PROPFIRST > . < PROPMALE > . \ 
Why are their so many guys in Lady Gaga's life ? 
My cocker spaniel , < PROPFEMALE > is a beast . <3 \ 
Bought her some doggy bones todayy , & when I gave her one she devoured it within seconds . My little < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
P.S. Mom switched to basic cable . I no longer have comedy central . BS . 
The excitment I have for knowing my alphabet backwards is off the charts right noww . \ 
I keep saying it over and over in my head . <3 
\Y el corazón 
Breakfast for lunch . \ 
Yumm . <3 \ 
Thanks mom . \ 
Hiccups . \

\Yo no quiero agua 
If only money grew on trees . \ 
Then maybe I would actually participate in Arbor Day . 
Got my dress . \ 
\The wild women . The rippin ' & the tearin ' . The rippin ' and the tearin ' . \ " \ 
Psst . Guess what ? I don't want to alarm you but your pride is showing . \ 
& it makes you look pathetic . \ 
Just sayin ' . 
My dad says the most deepest things . It get's you thinking . 
Stupid sister is making me listen to the radio for her name . \ 
She better win this stupid contest , cause it's waisting my valuable time . 
I'm the most gayest straight person I know . 
I can't believe how hard it is to find the movie , \Fluke\ " \ 
< PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE > <3 \ 
It's official . Movies from when I was twerp are AMAZING . 
Bitches never stop trippin ' 
Today's fight was crazy . 
Dad : Did you know when someone on a show is in some kind\ 
of trouble with the law they kill themm . \ 
Mom : WHAT ? \ 
Dad : They kill their character on the show . Like have them get hit by a car or something . Not in real life . \ 
Mom : Oh . \ 
I found this very amusing . 
Just one of those days . \ 
I'm loving how you look more and more like a girl each passing dayy . \ 
I guess since you act like one , you wanna look like one too . \ 
Asshole . 
My mom found our dog < PROPFEMALE > a mate . \ 
She's gonna get KNOCKED UP . 
I want a new phonee . I feel guilty asking my mom for another one thoughh . What to do , what to do . 
I don't care that it's probably below freezing outside right now . While most of you want some hot chocolate , I could go for some ice cream . 
School starts just a bit to early , even with an open first . 
Oreos . Yum <3 
I hate that my hands and feet are colder then ice not only in winter , but all year long . Wtf . 
Walking around campus for a bit . I don't want to go back to my english class just yet . 
My mom just broke 3 laws in only 5 minutes . Then we drove for less then a minute and noticed a cop . Luckily he stopped someone else . My mom laughed and called him fucker . \ 
Lmao . <3 
Crapp . I can't remember where I left the Oreo I was eating . \ 
-______- \ 
Somewhere in my room there is a half eaten Oreo and even though I don't like doubting myself , I don't think I'll be finding it anytime soon . 
Found it . <3 
Mom is cooking eggs and she accidently drops a piece of an egg shell on one . I kindly point it out for her to get it . She says , \Leave it . That's where all the calcuim is . \ " \ 
Gonna attempt to curl my hair . 
Attempt to curl hair = failure . \ 
Night FB . 
Beyond irritated . 
Pink lemonade never tasted so good . 
Sweetheart , you've never looked any better . \ 
** This is no complement . 
An apple a day keeps the doctor away . \ 
Skipping school for a day keeps the drama away . 
( 500 ) Days of Summer . <3 \ 
\This is not a love story \"" 
I wonder if my mom will let me stay home tomorrow like she did today . \ 
Mmm , doubt it . 
\That's why the water is salty . From the whale sperm\ " \ 
If you can't stand the heat , then why the fuck are you even in the kitchen ? 
So today I went to the soccer game to take pictures for yearbook . \ 
I witnessed a kid throw a frisbee at this little girl . Possibly his younger sister . Idk . \ 
He claims it was an accident . I personally think otherwise . 
Midwinter tomorroww . Yay & at the same time yuck . \ 
: I 
Finally taught my dog < PROPFEMALE > how to sit on command . \ 
Watching Disturbia & eating pizza <3 \ 
Great dayy . \ 
The Rugrats Movie <3 \ 
I remember begging my sister to take me to see this movie in theaters when it \ 
first came out . \ 
Had some good ceviche in class thanks to Joel . \ 
Thanks mann . 
Here's a simple solution to almost all your problems ... GET OVER IT . 
My pup can sit and lay on command . According to my mother she now handles her buisness outside , and currently is learning the paw trick and is being leashed trained . \ 
If there's anything better then warm pizza , it's cold pizza . <3 
That's it ! Notifications on my phone are off ! \ 
Fuck you guys ! 
Yearbook . Finally done until last deadline . <3 \ 
Gonna relax for the next couple of days . \ 
My dad just gave me a lecture because I didn't eat a few of my vegtables . \ 
Wtf . 
\Stupid\ " is a mean word . \ 
\You know freshmenn\ " \ 
You're locked in a room . There are no windows . Just walls , and you have a piano , a calender , and a bed . How do you eat , drink , and get out ? 
There's no such thing as a sure thing . 
Finally something to look forward to on Tuesday nights . \ 
My Life As < PROPFEMALE > <3 
< PROPFEMALE > finally knows how to give me her paw . \ 
Today seemed alot better then most days . \ 
Ahhh , just read the craziest thing ever . \ 
Need to hurry home and look more into it . Ahaha 
Casper <3 \ 
I absolutely detest soup . 
I can just tell tomorrow's gonna be a really bad day . 
I really just don't want to go to school today . 
Just got up from one really long nap . 
< PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > . Seriously ? I'm getting stressed out just by watching the damn show . 
Oh how I've missed break . \ 
\If I was a fly 
Possibly getting a new phone tomorrow . <3 \ 
Yay for special deals at tmobile . 
My goal is to learn to play \One Last Wish\ " on the piano before break is over . <3 " 
Mom & I waisted about an hour at the tmobile store just so the stupid idiot can fuck up pretty much everything . From the internet on my phone , to the new phone we got being completly useless . Now we have to wait till Monday to get it all fixed up because he said , \Were are too busy today and have people waiting . \ " \ 
\Whats this about ? I figured love would shine through \ 
On stickam . I forgot how funny this site is . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Garden's chocolate mints . \ 
< PROPFIRST>'s day ? Never heard of it . \ 
Alright . Going to the tmobile store to activate my new phone . Hopefully the idiot from last time isn't there and my mom & I will actually get someone who can get the job done & right . 
It really is hard to find good help these days . \ 
Everyone at the tmobile store are idiots . \ 
No new phone . For now anyways . \ 
I'm not giving up that easily . 
Mom wants to bleach parts of bangs . \ 
Let's see how it turns out . 
Made my dad chocolate covered strawberries . \ 
Gave my mom a haircut and highlights . \ 
I don't always appreciate the stuff they do for me , so a small gift from me to themmm . <3 \ 
Seriously the best parents in the whole world . No one can compare . \ 
< PROPMALE > Brand <3 
Getting sick . Today of all days . \ 
Perhaps love sickness ? \ 
Pshh , yeah right . Ahaha . \ 
Just your average fever . 
Only good thing about being sick is how amazing you feel once you start getting better . 
Hip . Hip Hop . Hip Hop Anonymous . 
I need to meet a chick by March 4th to see the movie \Beastly\ " with . \ 
Was about to go to bed and I heard a coyote howling outside . \ 
Now I want to see the movie , \Coyote Ugly\ " \ 
You know your having a good break if you start waking up around this time and can't remember what day it is . \ 
I'm having an awesome break . \ 
Red Riding Hood . \ 
Gotta see it . 
Six flags anyone ? 
I feel like I'm going to cough up a lung . \ 
I find it funny that right when my sister calls me I hear the thunder outside and then all the lights go out . Remind me never to answer her phone calls againnn . 
At home playing xbox kinect with the familyy . \ 
Watching my parents play . Priceless . 
I'm already counting the days till next break . 
Peruvian soda . <3 \ 
No other soda can compare . \ 
I'd tell you , but then I'd have to kill you . 
Dad wants to get an xbox 360 so he can use the kinect . Thanks sis for bringing it over . I guess he hasn't had enough . \ 
Mom brought me a balloon from the party she went to tonight . \ 
It's squeaky/chipmunk voice timee . \ 
Parent's are taking me out to eat . \ 
Dear sis , stay off my facebook . Don't use my account to send yourself things on farmville . Don't make me change my password .... AGAIN . \ 
Love always , your annoying little sister . <3 
Do I really want to go back to school tomorroww ? No . Of course not . \ 
Maybe I can trick my mom by telling her school doesn't start till next Tuesday .

Hanging out with the yearbook staff today was AWESOME . \ 
Last night I was dreaming that I woke up around 8 am . Then I went back to sleep and it was 4pm . I went back to bed and I actually woke up from my dream and it was 11am . Either I missed a whole day , or my dreams are messing with my head . \ 
P.S. Even in my dreams I'm sleeping . Wtf . Ahaha 
Still can't get over the fact that we got over a hundred free tickets yesterday at < PROPFIRST>'s . <3 \ 
That almost never happens . Ahaha

Right handed people live , on average , nine years longer than left-handed people . 
So I decided to make my bed a couple of minutes ago . \ 
Yeah , kinda dumb since I'm gonna mess it up in a few minutes but there's something about laying in a freshly new made bed that makes me sleep better at night . Just sayin ' . 
Laying down in my freshly new made bed I can't help but to look around and see how everything else is so unorganized . It's almost midnight and I'm cleaning my room . This can't be normal , but I can't help it . Ahaha 
I need a new bulb for my lava lamp . Hmph . 
Wow . I just got pranked by some guy I don't even know . 
Summer is just around the corner . Ugh\ 
It needs to be winter again . 
I like that the freeway walls out in Irvine are decorated with pretty little pictures of flowers . You'll never find class like that out in Riversidee . 
Out in < PROPFEMALE > Park . The only thing that's keeping me from telling my mom it's time to go , is the cake they have yet to pass around . After that I'll be more then happy to go homee . 
I have a compass on my phone . Awesome . 
Okay , I know you can't download new apps onto your phone when you don't have enough memory . But I didn't know you couldn't delete stuff off of your phone because you don't have enough memory . Wtf . How does that happen ?
