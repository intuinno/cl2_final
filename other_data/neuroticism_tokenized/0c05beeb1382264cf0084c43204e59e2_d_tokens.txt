If you play violin or < PROPFEMALE > , here's a cool trick I just figured out : smash your left ear against the side of the instrument while you're holding it and play anything .

Would the members of the Transparent Sacrifice ( < PROPFIRST > Tu , < PROPMALE > Bellows , < PROPFIRST > Zhang ) be interested in getting together for a rehearsal sometime tomorrow at somebody's house ? If not , we could probably stay afterschool Monday .

Incomprehensible math homework , like so many other unspeakables , is best done lying on the floor .

Two more days . Shit . :( 
Bittersweet day . 
had a fun day , aside from the whole < PROPFEMALE > Tugadi-injuring-his-wrist part of it . 
A respiratory ailment and longing for someone made for a miserable day .

May have finished his extended essay . @_@ 
Like this status and I will tell you something completely and utterly false . It'll be an outright lie , but I'll make it interesting . 
suddenly realizes that he doesn't have any idea what to title his EE . >_> 
Extended Essay : Accomplished . \ 
Halloween Costume : Accomplished . \ 
Everything Else : What ? 
has had an awesome ( and LOOOOOOOOOONG ) day so far . I expect it to improve . 
< PROPFIRST > Vitz-Wong , < PROPFIRST > A . Yule , < PROPFIRST > Ceder ! What say you to Saturday at < PROPFIRST>'s house whenever the SAT happens to be over ? You know why ... 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hall ! < PROPFEMALE > came back to my porch ! :D 
The Math 2 SAT subject test was pretty difficult , and I probably should have studied ... \ 
Luckily , it was cushioned by Literature and Biology E for me , so I didn't feel so bad afterwards , but still . 
Congrats on winning 1st place at Auburn , Ram Band ! 
< PROPFIRST > Tu and < PROPFIRST > Bargones-Duckstein : I'm not going to be able to stay after school on Monday for Stars and Stripes , so it looks like we're going to have to do it during chamber/orchestra time . That means getting up early , < PROPFIRST > . 
How do you guys think \The Orgiastic Typewriter\ " would look on a concert program ? " 
A message to the silly people out there who apparently think < PROPFEMALE > Alleman Troxel and I are going out : We are both ardent man-lovers . If I were going out with someone , he would be male . Okay ? 
AUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHH 
just got home . And now it's math time . 
3 hours of little black dots = massive hand cramp . But I'm now 73.2% done ! 
Where did all of my motivation go ? D: 
No school tomorrow . It's official . 
Do you guys think Dinter will be at school tomorrow so I can go water my plants ? 
HL Bio kids ! Ms. Dinter wrote to tell me that she would be at school this Friday so we could water our plants , but she's also willing to come in tomorrow if you absolutely need to do it then . Let me ( or her ) know asap , because it would probably be better if we all came on the same day . 
Dinter's at school at 2:00 , so go if you need to . 
I <3 Stravinsky . 
I'll never stop spraying urea ... 
Awesome day . And now I must sleep . 
Back from Iowa City ! 
The MI is done . Now time for Lear ! 
D ! S ! C ! H ! 
Could somebody be so kind as to tell me what happened at school today ? 
Anything of consequence at school today , kiddies ? 
Don't you hate it when you skip something because you're sick and don't end up feeling as sick as you thought you'd be ? I'd much rather be at rehearsal . :( 
\Fallacious\ " is the sound a dead rabbit makes . " 
Wants to write cheesy pop-sounding music . What's wrong ? 
Awesome time at the Seattle Chamber Music Society's master class today , guys ! 
3RD CHAIR !!!!!!!!!!!! :DDDDDD 
TOK was by far my favorite class of my IB career . Have fun , IB juniors ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Loubet-Senear , < PROPFEMALE > of Sparkles , your crown awaits your < PROPMALE > pate . 
So , apparently I'm taking a health class from Brigham Young University . This should be interesting . 
If you want to evoke your ancestors , use bassoons . 
Today was a great day , and things are set to improve for tonight ! 
Hey theory kids ! What does Henderson want us to say about Chopin ? 
Mambo ! 
Dead tired . But the IA's done . 
I dream of transferring Drosophila ... 
Boom chick diggadum 
Someone should start the Puget Sound Youth Chamber Orchestra , just so there can be an ensemble called PSYCHO . 
I had a dream that I wrote a string sextet about an aloe plant that had been raped by a thorny tree that was constantly fluctuating between spring and fall , i.e. its leaves would fall off and then regrow all at once . How odd . 
Is it okay to talk about chords as if you had synaesthesia on Theory homework ? >_> 
This earth is going to get danced out so hard ... 
Congratulations Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras on a successful sacrifice ! 
For those of you who missed Sunday's SYSO concert ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Lura , Dylan < PROPFIRST > , etc . ) , you can hear the entire thing , including all of the Rite , tonight at 8:00 on 98.1 < PROPMALE > Fm . It's epic ! 
So , I suppose I have to tell you guys that I've been accepted into the University of Washington . 
If you're not listening to Brahms right now , you're a terrible person . Jk . But still . Do it . Do it now . Don't miss the Poco Allegretto . 
ZOMG TUNE IN TO 98.1 < PROPMALE > FM RITE NOW . 
I'm finally done . I'll also never look at buildings with parabolic roofs the same way ever again ... 
Best . Monday . Ever . 
Wow . I won't be surprised if my feet turn purple by the end of Thursday . >_> 
Guess who managed to get absolutely no homework done tonight !
