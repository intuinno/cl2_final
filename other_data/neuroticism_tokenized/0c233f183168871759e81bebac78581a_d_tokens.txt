A pile of things . A mind makes a rather good table . 

westborough is such a boring town . full of yuppy , conservative , REPUBLICANS . uck . This is like the type of town where 90% of car sales are soccer mom vans , and 50% of the money is spent between abrocrombie and fitch , and lawsuits that violate our first amendment rights . A town where the only bars around only cater to the old , decrepit , dropout drunks of society . 
I won't be on for awhile . Someone stole my laptop tuesday night . so im sorry for all of you who will be lacking in my presence . bye ! 
So , I just moved to Peabody ! The transfer went great , and rain is wet . Booyah ! 
damnit ! this is what happens when you drink WAAAY too much coffee ! Very bad idea when you have work in the morning , and a full day planned after ! Oh well ! I can just do it again tomorrow when I actually AM sleep deprived , unlike right now ....

Ruined goods can never be given away in perfect condition . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas .

Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross . They only want what everyone wants- to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you are faced with it 
tthankyou to allll , now i have to go to work !
