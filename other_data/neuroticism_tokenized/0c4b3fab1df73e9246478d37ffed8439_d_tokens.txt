A word to the wise ain't necessary , it's the stupid ones who need the advic - < PROPMALE > Cosby

i feel like i'm under house arrest , i cant go anywhere , and i have to do things i don't want to do , i guess thats just life . I just wish people would stop blaming me for being unavailable to come over to their houses .

The blade carries with it a thousand screams of pain . 
Knowing others is wisdom , knowing yourself is Enlightenment . 
If ifs and buts were < PROPFEMALE > and nuts the world would never go hungry

Today ... \ 
was a good day ! 
It's time to stop procrastinating , and focus . 
:) 
The black walls rise again to enclose me . \ 
I thought i had long since left this place , but here i am again . \ 
Will i be-able to escape this time or will i disappear in this abyss ? \ 
But most importantly will i be missed ? \ 
Who will miss a nobody in the sea of nobodies . 
off i go to sleep after a long day 
Weather like this has never graced us with its presence on a school day ...

I just so happen to be happy ... 
The worst fear ( I think ) is the fear brought on by the disturbance of what we know to be reality . 
I think it's a stretch to hope for no school tomorrow ... \ 
It probably won't snow enough for that 
I believe in what tomorrow will bring ... 
I guess i get my life back now , though i will miss speech ... \ 
bittersweet ... 
So here we are ... doing that crazy thing called life ... 
Does spring break happen at different times for other schools ? 
In all truth , aren't we all just pretending ?

I think these days of being a teenager ( the years i have been tortured ) I will long for the most ... looking forward to the future , goodness i'm tired .
