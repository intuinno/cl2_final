Watching the < PROPFEMALE > Parade with my girls , just as I watched it with my mom when I was their age . :-) 

Shabbat Shalom ! 
At home , my goodness it is cold outside !!! Finally found doggie jackets , so they have some protection from the cold . 
last day of vacation . guess I should start on those big projects I need to get done before I go back to work . Tomorrow . 
We attended a wonderful wedding and reception last night ... got home after 1 AM . The adults had fun and so did the kids . Nice . 
Dinner at grandparents , kids running amok , gotta get some sleep , < PROPFEMALE > said she's out of clean jeans , don't have a landline anymore -- how may people have we forgotten to tell ?, work tomorrow , do I have clean pants ?, holy cow , it's that late already ?!?!, g

We disconnected our landline , so ( 402 ) 483-2904 is no longer a means of reaching us . 
Posted to my profile but not my wall : We disconnected our landline , so ( 402 ) 483-2904 is no longer a means of reaching us . 
We just saw the < PROPFEMALE > Trek \prequel\ " It was GREAT !!!! " 
We're to the back side of the civil calendar year . The days are already getting shorter . If I wasn't busybusybusy , would time slow down ? I'd like that . 
at work , long night ahead . too much paper on my desk ... But tomorrow will be better ! 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > McFerrin on \Riverwalk Jazz\ " . Very cool -- and easy to work to ! " 
I think I'll leave for home soon . My brain isn't firing on all cylindars anymore . 
aarrgh . work tomorrow . 
more chances to \get it right\ " tomorrow . to do good work . to make my corner of the world a better place . guess that meas I need to get my sleep . nitey nite ! " 
crying at my computer at work is NOT cool . At least I am not sniffling , too . 
Just another day in Paradise . 
Great dance recital pix now in my wall photos . Check out my darling daughters ! Not that I am biased , or anything , lol ! 
chaos , chaos and barely hemmed in chaos . My domestic , inner and professional lives , writ small . 
< PROPFEMALE > Sotomayor is pro at answering difficult questions , especially those that are designed to trip her up . 
My Dad's yahrzeit is this week . I'll be in shul saying Kaddish for him . Losing people really messes wth my head . 
Removed girls from their daycamp program today . Tzipi hid in the back corner of the basement , under all kinds of furnature and stuff , to avoid going . She's generally level-headed about stuff one doesn't want to do but needs to do anyway . They have been 
I am trying not to get lost in the morass of paper I am responsible for moving from my desk to someone else's desk ... 
I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed being the second set of hands for wrenching on motorcycles ( and cars ) . 
dislikes having to search the couch for gas money . i went to college and got a Corporate < PROPFEMALE > job to avoid having issues like this . Rats ! 
productivity at work -- had \work dreams\ " all night last night . " 
INVITATION : < PROPFIRST > is reading Torah this Shabbat , and we're sponsoring lunch afterwards in honor of his birthday and his remarkable progress after surgery . Hope you'll come share this big event with us . 
thrifted all 3 < PROPMALE > Potter costumes for girls for slumber party Saturday nite -- under $20 ! got to chat with my < PROPFIRST > and his < PROPFEMALE > for a bit & finally found < PROPFIRST > b-day gift ! Tonight : bake brownies , buy chips and ice cream for big ( ok just Ham Clan ) b-d 
We Hamicksburgs know how to par-teh ! 
J's sick with the bug kids all had . So far , I am not . Baruch HaShem . 
I now have the bug ... 
got out of bed on the wrong side this AM -- the 4 or 5 times I had to get up from 1131 PM ( last night ) to 0710 AM when I overslept my alarm clock . 
Sotomayor confirmed ! YEAH !!!!!!! 
I just bought a new-to-me washing machine . Sight unseen . It's a KitchenAide and it's almond colored . After spending 6+ hours and $100 at the laundrymat this weekend , a $150 washer with a 7 month warrenty is better than fine by me ! 
< PROPFIRST > micromanaged the kids into cleaning up the house last night -- it was SO nice ! We all even got to bed at a reasonable ( for us ) hour . and I Skype'd with < PROPFEMALE > this AM -- how cool is that ?!?! 
distracted 
Shopko for back to school -- have flyer and coupons in hand , with list of what we don't already have . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > gone ... a great loss 
< PROPFIRST > and I get to attend < PROPMALE>'s cocktail party ! 
back to work , back to school , back to reality . Wait--'back to\ ? I never really left . Must do something about that ... " 
home sick , feel like h-e-double hockeysticks . have to be healthy for tomorrow -- first day of 4th grade for the Troublets . 
still feel like cr@p--can't afford to take another sick day . still , it's nice to have the ' normalcy ' of school year rythm return .. 
Normal school year -- rats . we were late to school this AM . I am going to be a drill sargeant ( need to get a whistle ) from here on ... 
Tzipi suggests we buy a hybrid car/plane so we can get to school and work faster ( on time ) . She may have to be the one who invents it ... 
funeral for a dear woman in the AM , granddaughter time in the afternoon and a ( super fun ) kid b-day party ( Omaha ) this evening . Home about 10:30 . Turning off brain and closing eyes now ... 
Is it a ) Friday or b ) 5 o'clock yet ? 
I adore my puppies ... I need to do laundry ... what am I going to make for dinner ... write an inspection findings report ... D and I started another year of ballet today ... first spelling test is Friday ... need to vacuum the car ... crawling into my bed would be SO lovely right now ... 
looking to try out wrist bands for motion sickness releif for 2 of the girls . Anyone have kid-sized ones they're not using that I could boroow for a couple weeks ? 
I am not having fun anymore . Time to do something different . 
Going to pick up girls and the < PROPFEMALE > from airport . 
I want to be super-hyper-productive and I want to take a 48 hour nap . 
Not thinking about the zillion bug bites and the itch ... slow making-me-crazy itch . .. or be sleepy from the \cure \"" 
going home now ... 
what the H-E-double hockey sticks was I thinking !?!?!?!? 
trying to focus , so many things need to be doe ** FIRST ** 
getting \stuff off my plate \"" 
restful afternoon , me outside finishing a Discworld book , my feet propped on a tree , doggies digging happily in the hard mud near my chair . ahhh 
bought groceries , rotated compost pile , helped grandma clean out girls ' room ( at her house ) , worked with kids on chores ( which is like trying to train cats to be service animals for the disabled ) . Glad we have tomorrow off , I need the rest . 
Why does cleaning create such a mess ?!?!?! We're going through all the girls ' books , [ they have waaay too many and don't care for them properly ( NEVER had this problem with Michael ) . ] and they various piles are all over the living room ... 
I like 3 day weekends -- I got rest on the Sabbath and got big stuff and mundane stuff done Sunday and Monday . Now to do the same at work :-) 
My daughters are now officially permitted to wear training bras ... not that there's a need , of course . Still a < PROPMALE > milestone in their lives . 
Our heartfelt condolences go out to the entire immediate and extended family of < PROPMALE > Kushner who passed away this morning , 21 Elul , September 10 , 2009 . May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion . Baruch Dayan HaEmet 
Off to Curriculum Night at the girls ' school . Hope to be before 9 ... cuz the girls and I all really need some sleep . 
and yet , inexplicably , Roadhouse is one of my favorites ... 
had it all worked out in her head , but found it was gone once she sat down at her computer to write . 
It's almost Rosh Hashanah , it's almost Rosh Hashanah , it's almost Rosh Hashanah .... 
I LOVE the High Holidays !!!! 
and < PROPFEMALE > just finished making challot for the holiday- 2 big , 6 small and 6 small cinnamon sugar'd . Back to sleep for awhile while they rise . 
Honeycake(s ) and house cleaning are next on our holiday prep list . :-) 
Kids on time to school today , homework done and lunches packed . My husband is my hero ! 
cleaning the basement may not count as teshuvah , but that's how we're spending the day prior to Kol Nidre . 
Beautiful services ( thanks < PROPFEMALE > , Cantor < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > B . et < PROPMALE > ) , dear friends , easy fast , yummy break-the-fast , burdens lifted from my shoulders . It's a good day . 
Ah , PassDay ' , the day the paycheck passes into ones account and right back out again . 
home with kids -- everyone queasy or worse . Yippie ! 
need to be hoizontal for awhile 
going to sleep now . finally got some stuff listed on ebay 
It takes me 4 days to catch up from missing one day at work/school . That and I can't remember what day it is .... 
what's on my mind is the usual adult worries -- money , chilcare , career , family . So what else is new ? 
the music my girls will remember from their childhood , their \comfort music\ " as adults ... They Might Be Giants and R.E.M. " 
wishes people would quit whining about the purported snow and cold coming this weekend . When it's too deep to walk through AND it's colder than -10 F , THEN whining is appropriate . Geez ! 
eBay maven-in-training ... 
got the hardware set up for my new eBay/ Half.com mega sales maven office .. now to run the internet connection and load the printer software ... 
zero progress made in eBay maven land . Have had a resourceful weekend getting household chores done with NO HOT WATER !!! Hopefully , we'll have a hot water heater tomorrow night . Think good thoughts ! 
I think I am a caught up on my friends ' lives . A little ... 
I am ill and I am unamused . 
my lungs hurt . 
The Hamicksburg Family is QUARANTINED at home . 
Still sick -- going to doctor , all of us , today . 
is feeling almost human , baruch HaShem ! To school and work we go . 
Not going to make it to the school stargazing event :-( We won't get everything done that we have to before needing to leave . It's too bad we live so far away and that the girls missed so much school in the last 2 weeks . 
Still coughing . Not improving much . Still scaring co-workers who are concerned about catching swine flu . 
has started her holiday shopping ... frugally . 
still coughing but otherwise feeling much better . 
working for the weekend 
Tripped on dog tie out cable , fell , hit the driveway , sommersaulted , rolled to a standing position . Broke at least 1 toe . Saving grace -- it was 1 AM so no one saw me . 
woke up , drawing breath , soul returned to body . Good start to the day ! 
Geeking out at work with Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition . Great music to do paperwork by ! 
productive day . forgot to eat lunch . 
ummm , it's Thursday . That means it's figure out everything I started but haven't finshed yet and get it finished by tomorrow . In Theory , anyway ! 
why didn't my recent status update show up here ? 
can lead a colleague to cGMP documentation skills , but can't make them use them . 
' s Mom-type-person is having lumpectomy and maybe removal of lymph nodes this AM . It is outpatient surgery and she'll be home tonight . I think that's just wrong . More to the point I am very scared . 
and the beat goes on , and the beat goes on . dah de dah de de . dah de dah de dah . 
too nervous to sleep . got home from a lovely Shabbat dinner around midnight ( Thanks Witkowski's!) . Cannot seem to mellow out and sleep . I REALLY need to catch up on solid sleep ... 
Sunday night -- ate the \trial\ " pumpkin pie for dinner along with big glass of milk . That's the kind of nutritious dinner I can really dig into ! (' trial ' as in first attempt with kid assistant ) " 
need Hanukkah gifts help : I want to get in-line skates for Illyana ( prefer adjustable size 1-4 ) , a scooter for Tzipi ( like a razor kick scooter ) and one or the other for < PROPFEMALE > . Any one out there in FBland have gently used versions of these items they would like to get rid of ? Thanks 
Mom person ( aka Grandma < PROPFEMALE > ) back in for more surgery today . The tissue removed last week didn't have all \clean edges\ " . Also 2 of 5 lumph nodes removed were cancerous . She sees the oncologist Friday . I am doing the \ " heavy cooking\ " Thursday . :-) " 
I am grateful for my friends -- not only are they compassionate nuturing souls , but an endless source of information ! 
glad today is today and tomorrow will be whatever it darn well wants to be . < PROPFIRST > , please call your mother . thx 
dinner roll dough rising , parade is on , more coffee brewing . Thankful for ability to read , kneed and bake . Thankful for material niceties and the ability to enjoy them . Thankful for percolator my friend < PROPFIRST > got me ( thanks < PROPFIRST >!) and the ability to use it . Thankful my body is strong and healthy . Thankful my home is lit , warm and 
Spousal-unit and I both have a headcold . Kids do not . I should be grateful for that , right ? 
still sick , kids fighting ( not cleaning like they should be ) and am discovering international shipping is a real PITA !!!! Otherwise , it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood ! 
what to do what to do what to do so very very much to do what to do what to do what to do 
Mom-person/Grandama < PROPFEMALE > update : saw the oncologist yesterday – treatment will be radiation and tamoxofen ( or the newest generation ) . About 70% odds of survival 10 yrs . More tests and bone scans and x-rays , etc . and she won’t start the radiation until after the first of the year . 
donated blood -- 1 unit in 4 mins . 12 secs . personal best is 3 mins . 57 secs . 
Up till 11 , up at 4 . Turkey cooked , and meat removed from bones and properly dispatched to freezer ( for pot pie and soup stock making ) and fridge for sandwiches , cat and dog treats and gravy making . YUM !!! 
Check out the girls ' 4th grade school pix in my album 
fell in the middle of the street while taking dogs out last night . ouch ! bruised and cut up elbow , back wrenched , sore spot on the back of my head . 
The girls and I got hair cuts after stocking up for the impending blizzard . 1 pony tail for Locks of Love , 3 bobs and a trim for mom . Girls are so cute/beautiful/adorable with their new cuts !!! 
is off through the ever deepening snow to the doctor's ... needs to get elbow x-rayed . 
' s daschunds seem to like the snow -- even though it is nearly over their heads ! They look like brown flying fish breaking the surface of the snow , coming all the way out and \splashing\ " back in ... " 
chatting on FB , not doing anything that needs to be done . 
Still home ... no cabin feever ... kids play outside , even after dark when they shouldn't , even when I am yelling at them to get their darn chores done , even though we seem to have only 1 pair of snow boots ( I was sure there were a pair for all 3 of them ) . 
Now up to 2 pair of actual snowboots ... 
attempting to get 3 kids up , moving and out the door to school by 7 . hmmm , what are the odds ? 
Lovely night with the kids and grandkid -- a menorah each to light , latkes , chocolate , presents , traditional and non-traditional Hanukkah music , laughter . Happy Second Day Of Hanukkah ! 
Uploading pix from Hanukkah Day 2 -- then to Hanukkah Hop at the shul ! 
tired , tired , tired . should have gone to bed an hour ago . pix uploaded to FB tho , so not a waste of time ;-) 
is at work , on time . girls to school , on time . husband in Omaha doing dreaded paperwork . There was no screaming & no fighting this AM . Yet another Hanukkah Miracle ! 
Hopes she can make out some of what's being said at tonight's Hanukkah Program -- enunciation isn't a grade schooler's strong suite . Will be kvelling in any case ! 
High Anxiety , not the movie . Too much to do in the next 5 workdays . Want to go home and light candles with the family , should stay here and get work done . 
Am called the best Eema in the whole world by my daughters b/c I give them the best Hanukkah presents EVER !!! ( gotta love how the enthusiasm dies off when there are chores to be done ! ) LOL ! 
at work . On another note , my birthday is tomorrow and I am as excited about my birthday now as when I was a little kid ! A friend at work decorated my desk and bulletin board with lots of balloons ! FUN ! YEAH for birthdays ! 
Thanks for the birthday wishes , everyone ! Made my day all the happier ! 
Happy Solstice & a good Yule . May the darkness be banished and the light be bright once again . 
ACCKK !! Thibitz !!! 
Got to work safely , no problems with roads once I was off my street . I am in a great mood -- glad to be at work . 
Boss just dismissed us -- time to go home ... or at least not stay here . 
A happy SolChrismaHanukwanzikkah to all my friends and family ! 
I promised the girls I'd take them to see < PROPMALE > and The Chipmunks today . I am sure I can drive there , but I really don't want to see this movie ... maybe I'll just drop them at the theatre and come back an hour and a half later ... 
Tomorrow will be Postponed Christmas Day . I'll do all the things that were supposed to be done on Christmas Day -- go to the movies , dinner and presents at Grandma < PROPFEMALE>'s and Grandpa < PROPMALE>'s . Ahh , I love the holiday season ! 
I cannot believe it's day 5 of my winter break and the house is a bigger mess than before ! I am obviously doing something wrong ... 
meeting the Elf Brigade for some bowling at 10 
it is STILL snowing ... again . 
Just got back from annual dinner date with my college < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , to celebrate our December b-days . Terrific fun !! laughing at old jokes and comiserating about the pluses and minuses that come with our just turned age ( 43 ) . See you again in December 2010 , < PROPFIRST > ! 
Children balking at writing thank you notes , doing their chores etc . Situation normal ! Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > and Happy Birthday to my friend Terre ! 
10 years ago I was staying on the 4th floor ( maternity ) at St. < PROPFEMALE>'s and < PROPFIRST > & I watched out the nearly floor to ceiling window at all the fireworks the city of < PROPMALE > shot off . A sweet memory . 
Happy New Civil Year ! May we all have a year of health , love of family and friends , prosperity and chocolate . 
new year feels like the old year -- hoping things improve . 
Ghastly news on the old-and-dear-friends front . Another one bites the dust . We are unamused . 
At work , behaving normally . No one here knows I was up uintil nearly 3 amchatting on FB with other people who are shattered by the death of our friend . 
We must honor those whom we mourn by doing deeds of loving kindness and of tzedekah , to further those values held by our dear friend . 
Beginning to come to grips with Illya's death . < PROPFIRST > and the boys are helping . 
A friend at work and NE DOR said it was really dangerous to travel to work today -- so I guess I won't . 
ummm , flesh-tone ? ( as in my tone ) 
Girls off school another day . I think I'll go to work ... 
ackk , thibitz . 
Tired . Really , really tired . Like end of finals week , just finished the blue-book exam for your 400/800 level molecular genetics class , tired . 
Played first complete game of Monopoly with the girls . Good sportsplayership all around ! Oh , and I won . 
To all the mommies out there , repost this . How much did your child(ren ) weight at birth ? < PROPFIRST > 8 lbs 15 oz , Tziporah 2 lbs 10 oz , Illyana 3 lbs 4 oz , < PROPFEMALE > 2 lbs 13 oz . 
found pictures of Illya ' back in the day'--Michael's early day , that is . Will post here soon . 
My babies are 10 years old today ! 
compilation CD idea : covers of AC/DC songs by Big and < PROPMALE > () , < PROPFIRST > Boone ( Highway to Hell ) , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ( You shook me all night long ) , etc . 
New profile pic is my late , dear friend Illya Cavlan , with one of his favorite people -- Moochie ( aka < PROPFIRST > Hamicksburg ) , taken December 1989 . 
We need to have a family party at our house every month -- to keep up standards of cleanliness , ya know . 
< PROPFIRST > and I are hanging out with Elihu at the Blumkin Home for Shabbat this week . Shabbat shalom ! 
Still in Omaha with Elihu . 
Rabbi Elihu Milder died peacefully this morning near 2 AM . May his memory be a blessing . 
I hope to be done with the end of lifecycle events for a while -- 2 in 2 weeks is a bit much . 
Taking the day off from traumatic circumstances . I am at work , the girls are at school and < PROPFIRST > is home recovering from Monday's surgery . 
< PROPFIRST > had another surgery today -- he said to say he's fine . Meanwhile I totally fubar'd with my parental units here in < PROPMALE > . I didn't call this last week to check on < PROPFEMALE > who had radiation treatments for her breast cancer and I didn't call to tell them ( < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > ) that Rabbi Elihu passed away and when his funeral was . 
I am exhausted . Oh well . I have things to go , places to do and people to be , so I best get at it ! 
At work , doing work , oy , does my head hurt ... 
Happy National Chocolate Cake Day !!! 
So glad Shabbat is almost here ! Dinner at a friend's house tonight and then I can sleep in until 9 tomorrow morning ! 
I slept a lot this weekend . Still need to sleep more -- first 2 weeks of January really knocked me out . Sleep is wonderfully restorative to mind and body . 
I am enjoying my job today . :-) 
has spent the last 2 hours cooking dinner , explaining adverbs and adjectives , doing our taxes , making beer bread ( thx , Terre ! ) for lunches tomorrow , supervising 3 kids doing laundry , dishes , and critter care , drinking a very well deserved beer , advising that while serving dinner is NOT the time to ask me to go buy more ketchup , loading the dishwasher and tripping over all the aforementioned items . So there . 
Roads Omaha to < PROPMALE > slippery as snot . Lots of cars in the ditches -- can see the tire tracks in the fresh snow ... 
Don't feel well , girls and I are staying home today . They are pretty upset with me about it . 
I think my dogs are the only members of my household NOT currently in the doghouse ...

LET'S PURIM TOGETHER ! Tifereth < PROPMALE > and B'nai Jeshurun will jointly celebrate PURIM , Saturday evening , February 27 , at the < PROPFEMALE > . The celebration will begin at 6:30 p.m. with a Havdalah service , followed by a Purim service . There'll be a costume parade , songs , and an interactive retelling of Megillah < PROPFEMALE > , the Purim story , in the sanctuary . 
has hit the wall of sleep deprivation . You all know what I am talking about . Think I'll watch the Olympics , drink a beer and fall asleep on the couch by 8:30 . I am glad the girls can fend for themselves dinner-wise ! 
my brain stopped . 
up most of the night again -- friggin financial b.s. 
tired , tired , tired . unamused , too . Kids drive me crazy . Not that it's a long trip . 
Just talked to Rabbi Katzman -- the girls and I may have a place in Omaha for during the school week !! Time frame is just after Pesach ! Sweet !! 
PURIM this weekend !!!! Break out the etrogcello ! 
It's Purim at Friedel ! So many costums , so many cute kids ! Pix if I can get them to upload . Look for album called Purim 2010 
It is almost Shabbat ... I keep telling myself that as I try to stay focused at work . 
Just talked with the girls ' Hebrew teacher . Seems Tzipi has been passing notes with another girl in the class and will be removed from class for a week if it happens again . Oh , and she doesn't pay attention or do in class assignments or homework . This is my academically oriented child ?!?!?! 
Girls are in their first speech competition this afternoon ! If the butterflies in their tummies had escaped while driving to school this AM , I would have wrecked the car ! 
If Kucinich and Stupac voted for it , I think it is a true reflection of democracy . Everyone got input and nobody is happy with the result ... 
Simcha challah an unqualified success !! I am totally stoked to do it again ! Thanks again < PROPFEMALE > , for making it possible ! 
Monday night seder fanfreakintastic !!! Thanks to all who made it happen !!!! Next year in Jerusalem ! Barring that , next year at my place ! 
This just rocks !!!! The girls will be \at camp\ " nearly all summer -- sleep away camp ( Herzl ) from mid June til beg of July . Chabad ( Omaha ) day camp from July 5th-16th AND our local religious school's day camp from July 18- Aug 1st . What a great summer to be them !! " 
Dr. Who first episode of new Doctor . Missed the official premier last night , but BBC < PROPFEMALE > is rerunning the episode a lot in the next week . YAY !!!! 
attempted purple as newest hair color ( with a more traditional dark brown overlay ) . not so much . maybe my son will come fix it for me ( hint hint ) 
\Happy 62nd Birthday \"-- You Know Who You Are !!! " 
All kids sick . Dogs are healthy . Yeah . 
Another couple of hours and it will be Shabbat . I will not think/worry about money , laundry , the future . Only the here and now , my family , friends and my relationship with G-d . 25 entire hours of freedom . ** Shabbat Shalom to my Jewish friends and family ** ** Blessed Be for my Pagan friends and family ** ** peaceful Sabbath day to my Christian friends and family ** 
at work working ... except for 10 mins on FB . Go me . 
My husband and my son are my heros ! They unloaded and schlepped downstairs a new-to-me washer and dryer set . Then hooked up the dryer ! I am a lucky woman ! 
Shabbat Shalom , everyone ! 
well caffinated , brain engaged . in training 1-5 . 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness . It is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer ... at some point in our lives . Show your support . ? ? ? 
I have no response to that 
Happy Mothers Day to all of the mothers and mothers-to-be , as well as the grandmothers , aunts , sisters , female cousins , and close female friends who play an important role in any child's life !

Good stuff : It is Friday , a simchat bat is tomorrow , my simcha challah looks pretty good , and on Sunday , I get to see friends and go to a special dinner that honors a special friend . Ahhhh . Shabbat Shalom chaverim ! 
If ' Monday ' is going to show up twice in one week , I think people should be forewarned . 
I am no longer the mother of three fourth graders . hmmmm 
Finally got sleep -- feel MUCH better . Am now attempting to herd my 3 \cats\ " to complete chores . HA ! " 
I am , I am , I am Superman and I know what's happening . 
Credit card 1 ( of 3 ) is \resolved\ " as of the 15th !!!!! One less set of phone calls to avoid ! " 
Happy 12th Anniversary , Sweetheart ! 
The girls are on their first fishing trip , with their Abba , in Arkansas . I am hoping to see some pix of what they caught ( or of the one that got away ! ) 
The inside of the < PROPMALE > office on 10th and O Sts looks like it hasn't changed since the 1960's . 
I spent 3 hours ironing Tzipi's nametags into clothes , sheets , towels for camp , which starts Monday ! And I am not done with her stuff . And I haven't started on < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE>'s . OY . 
existentially speaking , why do I have a 23 year old son , 3 ten year old daughters and a 4 year old granddaughter ? 
Kids at camp -- photos already available -- Tz and D are in cabin 4 , but Tz is in the cabin photo for 5--I's cabin . Hmmmm . 
3 letters and 1 package ( goggles for < PROPFEMALE > that I forgot to pack ) in the mail to Herzl Camp this AM . Go me ! 
Feeling recharged -- almost . Maybe by Sunday I will have the spring back in my tail and will get some projects done ! 
The Futurama marathon is preventing me from going to bed ... I hate it when that happens ! 
< PROPFIRST > and I are leaving at 0'dark 30 tomorrow ( Monday ) to pick up the girls from camp . I wonder of I should buy air freshener for the back of the car where all their dirty laundry will be ... 
Kids are home , I'm at work , so no laundry is done . There is 6 weeks worth of camp laundry in my basement . I am afraid to go home ... 
I give up , I am going home where the work to be done doesn't require any actual use of my brain . 
My lunch was a religious experience . I am still glowing ... thin bagel with everything ( toasted ) , schmear , applewood smoked wild caught salmon , organic red leaf lettuce . Add about 10 halved apricots from our own yard and voila !! G-d's love for his people is revealed . 
My dad's gone 3 years today . I miss him more now than before . Strange , that . 
A Big 10-Q to < PROPFEMALE > for my sweet new profile pic ! 
New Warehouse 13 on tonight ! remembering that just made my whole day brighter ! 
Hiding at work until storm passes . I live South and West and the storm is moving North and East ... safer here ... I think . 
broke a tooth . wah . b #tch , whine , snivel , moan , complain . 
First day of LJCS daycamp for the kiddos . Soul Train has provided < PROPFEMALE > counselors , and the camp is longer this year , too . The girls are stoked !!!! 
Tuesday , < PROPFEMALE > b'Av . What else is there to say ? 
simcha challah made and in shul freezer . It is 2:30 AM , think I'll go to bed now . 
need . to . kick . brain . back . into . gear .

finished a < PROPFIRST > Sedaris and am now on < PROPFEMALE > Vowell's newest -- Wordy Shipmates . Interesting juxtaposition , as I started the rather scholarly ' Shipmates ' when 3/4 through ' Dress Your Family ' and read them conconcurrently . 
head full of work stuff pain 
facebook ads work ! http://www.kosherkeepers.com/wholesale-products.html 
Do I watch the new Warehouse 13 or take the girls shopping for school shoes tonight ? I think the remote and a beer are calling ... 
an hour late going home -- am not even hiding from my kids ! too much paper , too many expectations , too many deadlines , too too much . 
Leaving work early today to start the weekend-long bat and bar mitzvah celebrations in < PROPMALE > and Omaha ! 
Troublets are in the fifth grade as of today . I got weepy yesterday thinking that they'll be graduating from Friedel in only 2 years ... sniff . 
I got 1 of my kid's fundraising coupon books sold ! And not even to myself ! 
thinks Facebook creates a Venn diagram of the relationships in my life . 
Why isn't it the weekend yet ?!?!?! 
Happy Erev today and Rosh Hashanah sarting tonight !!!! \ 
Apples and < PROPFEMALE > all around ! 
??? ???? Happy New Year ! 
That which does not kill me makes me __________ . ( Clue to missing word -- the answer ISN'T strong ) 
If G-d only gives me as much as I can handle , I wish G-d didn't think so well of me . 
All of my girls got more than 100% on last week's spelling test ! 
made applesauce last night from the apples that the kids carried in their lunchboxes last week . I hope they like it in their lunch today as much as I did . :-) 
< PROPMALE > Jewish Community : Community Sukkah\ 
Our community sukkah has come apart . We are needing volunteers to come to Tifereth < PROPMALE > today and help put the sukkah's top and sides back together . If you are available today please call Nava at the office at 402-423-8569 immediately so that we are able to hold the Joint Sukkot event this weekend . Thank you . 
made baked trout with < PROPFEMALE > and crushed almonds . Fan-freakin-tastic ! The girls disagreed . More for me !! 
Headcolds should not be allowed to completely wipe me out for 48+ hours . It's just plain mean . 
Onward into the fog ... 
Off work today and tomorrow to celebrate Jewish holidays ! First time ever that I have had enough vacation time to observe the whole set of High Holidas . AWESOME ! 
Friedel makes me Kvell ! The girls read from the Torah during Simchat Torah ( first 10 lines of Bereshit ) AND Shabbat morning services -- the first 3 aliyot of Bereshit ! \ 
Thanks to Naama and Eadie ! 
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood . :-) 
0625 Wednesday morning : time to rouse the troops ! 
13 year old boy in Texas shot himself in the head after years of bullying and torment for being gay . < PROPMALE > Walsh , also 13 , < PROPMALE > himself from a backyard tree . < PROPFIRST > Clementi , 18 & a freshman at Rutgers , jumped off the GW Bridge - his roommate broadcast video of < PROPFIRST > with another ...... guy . Today , I STAND UP TO THOSE BULLIES in their honor ..... If you care to STAND UP with me , please post this . 
Off work now . Must get the kids , run errands and then go home and cook and clean . Guess I am not really off work after all . Click LIKE if this is your life , too . 
If you know me well , you know that\ 
I AM _______ I Love _______ and I can't stand ______ . \ 
Put this on your status and see how your friends respond . 
Shabbat Shalom all ! 
home today , unwell . garage emptied , cleaned ( by < PROPFIRST > ) now neither of us can move w/o making sea-lion type noises . All my CA friends know that sound ... at least 1 kid also unwell . Cat and dogs fine . 
still have a bug . girls missed school today and Monday . Hope tomorrow all the little viruses will have been killed off . 
Off to work . To prepare for a visit from a ' colleagues ' in the Netherlands . Which is to say , an audit by Corporate HQ . 
working , working , working -- trying to catch up on the stuff I didn't do while I was doing what I needed to do . 
If I could draw , I'd make my life into a comic strip . 
Shabbat Shalom . < PROPFIRST > is cooking up a yummy dinner and I am leaving work for an entire 36 hours ! 
At my desk at work . 3rd week of 4 . Then a weeks family vacation to Arkansas for Thanksgiving with mom-in-law . 
I think I'll try something different and go home BEFORE I am late . 
Today is Sunday and is my final Sunday at my job before our family vacation to visit J's mom and step-dad in Arkansas . These are the days of my life . 
Been productive so far this week . Getting off FB now so as to continue productivity streak . 
Off work and on vacation in T-48 minutes ! 
Leaving for AR in 9 hours ... half of kitchen cleaned and some of necessary laundry done . Deciding whether to bring turkey or buy one there . House sitters , and you know who you are , thank you for keeping an eye on our place while were gone .!!!! 
On the good ship , Lollypop , it's a great trip to the < PROPFEMALE > shoppe . 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > playing Twister with the girls while I play on FB . I love downtime ! 
Brisket and baked potatoes for dinner , apple and pumpkin pies for dessert -- just finished playing Yatzee . Just the 5 of us for T-Day this year . It was a good day . 
My vacation is over . A couple more weeks would be nice , I only just feel rested up and if I had more time off , I could get domestic projects done . 
One kid is sick -- the other 2 are normal . Sick isn't snarky . 
First day back at work today . My brain was still on vacation . Sigh . 
Chag Sameach Hanukkah ! \ 
Candles , fried food , presents , family . Doesn't get any better than this ! 
2nd night celebration : Big kids , medium sized kids and a small kid will be at our house for latkes ( by < PROPFIRST > ) , dreidl , candle lighting and presents ! 
Half way through Hanukkah -- still waiting for some of the girls ' gifts to arrive . Not like they are doing without thus far ... 
Told the girls no candles or presents until homework is done . Amazing how motivated they became ! 
Bribery , used judiciously , is a useful tool . 
and the annoying gentile does the motzie ! 
Last candles lit , last presents opened . Had sweet and sour chicken for dinner -- Dahlia asked if it was in preparation for Christmas . 
The annual Hanukkah program at the girls ' school is tonight . First performance for the new orchestra . I am looking forward to seeing the results of all the kids , faculty and staff's hard work ! 
Hanukkah program was the best I've seen to date -- the kids ( all ages ) said their lines so they could be understood ( Hebrew not withstanding ) . They were on time , on cue and on the < PROPFIRST > . A very creative script to boot ! \ 
Not that I am biased .... LOL 
Shabbat Shalom ! May peace find you , if just for 1 day . 
First yarzeit for my friend Illya this week . Said kaddish , of course . 
I am not sure I am ready to start a new work week . I don't think my prefernces are taken into account in these matters . 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one ... to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
cookies and milk for dinner while parked in front of the tele ( Dirty Jobs : Holiday Edition ) . Man , I love this time of year !! 
How do I undo the new profile setting ?!?!?! 
DADT goes down !!!! 
Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes ! I feel loved . :-) 
Sinus infections suck . and I can't even blow ... my nose . 
virus , in my ear , makes me feel dizzy and on my rear . 
A happy Christmahanukwanzikkah and WHOYC to all ! 
Home from AR . Had fun , Relaxed . Watched lots of Dr. Who . 
At work . Attempting productivity . Wish I were napping . 
May 2011 be your year ! 
AT work . no one else here . Dr. Who on the speakers . Gotta love it ! 
Kids late for school . AGAIN . As < PROPFEMALE > is home sick , I only had 2 to herd and still couldn't manage timeliness . Their principal must think I am the biggest loser parent ever . FEH ! 
< PROPFEMALE > told Tzipi and me to just \chillax\ " already . I am amused . " 
Home with 3 sick kids , a not-up-to-par husband and my own sore throat . Glad it's Friday , < PROPFEMALE > and cold out . Somehow makes being stuck home with sickies more bearable . 
watching Saturday morning ( now afternoon ) cartoons with the Troublets . 
10 years ago , 5 years ago , I drove to work in this kind of weather , no problem . Now , not so much . Am I maturing ? or becoming a wimp ? This IS a survey ... 
Hope there's school today b/c the girls are going no matter what ! 
Oy , finally home !! What a looong day . We came home to a deceased triop ( a small crustacean from a < PROPFEMALE > , kinda like Sea Monkeys ) . RIP \Racer\ " . Tzipi loved you . " 
Kids @ shabbaton until after havdallah . Went out with good friends , had great fun . A glimpse at ' empty nesthood' ? 
More birthday related fun today ! Steins are coming in from Omaha , food mirth and merriment shall ensue . 
Off to community concert at shul ! 
Would using \vindictive\ " and \ " spiteful\ " as modifiers of the same noun be repetitive ? " 
I am glad I made myself get out of bed this morning ... I didn't want to . 
It's Shabbat and I am still at the computer at work . Gonna leave it now , tho . 
Not a good parenting day . not a good domestic day . not a good work day . not a good driving day . harumph . 
snow day tomorrow+my W-2s finally arrived . Guess what I am doing tomorrow ? 
so far taxes not done , kitchen not cleaned , laundry ??? (haven't looked ) . OTOH , girls to dentist for check-ups ( postponed from 27Dec10 ) AND we're going to the library to return books that aren't overdue and work on Science Fair Projects . 
another snow day , maybe I can get done tomorrow what didn't get done today ? Or I could read one of the books I just checked out ... 
The Hamicksburg Girls have been diagnosed with Chicken pox today . They have only had lots of contact at Tifereth < PROPMALE > and Friedel Academy so please check your little ones for the little red bumps with white center if you have been in contact . 
Chicken pox update : Illyana feels better , but has a couple new ' spots ' . < PROPFEMALE > and Tzipi feel lousy and are as yet spot free . 
thank you everyone for the get will wishes and commiseration of all those whose kids have had \chicken spots\ " or remember their own . " 
Science Fair project day at the Hamicksburg's . 3 kids , 3 projects , only 1 experiment done to date . The scientific method is never going to be the same after this ... 
Stupid virus has messed up my computer , I can't send mail out and I can't format a CD to copy info onto AND ... IT ATE TZIPI'S SCIENCE PROJECT WRITE UP ! 
tax forms W-2 , 1099 and 1098 entered into tax prep program . Not done by a long shot . 
It is stupidly late . 1 science fair project done ( not the presentation board , tho ) and 2 more to go . Getting up at O'dark:30 to get project #2 done . 
Science Fair was terrific fun , but now that it's over , I have a d'var Torah to practice before services . 
Science Fair pix and my d'var torah for Ki Tissa are uploaded . These are the fruits of last week's labors . 
Taxes done and e-filed . Hope the IRS and NE Dep't of Revenue accept the filings and process them quickly ! 
Computers at home still iffy , can't access anything not directly work related from work computer , so if you really need to reach me , call my cell . \ 
< PROPMALE > , over and out . 
It's a Zoey day ! 
trying to catch up on all the happenings here since 2 weeks ago when our computers went kaflooey . Thx to my < PROPFEMALE > for working manymany hours to make the ' puters healthy again ! 
Making sure to wish happy b-days to people I love . 
Too many changes at once makes me very short tempered . Moving to a new office at work ( cubicles for the first time in 15 years)/a favorite co-worker no longer with the company/co-worker in my office is in the ICU/2 very deserving co-workers got promotions/ b.w.s.m.c. Oh and I have a cod ib by dos . Waa 
A cheerier post : Kids all registered for summer camp , deposits made , and requisite financial aid applications also done . < PROPFEMALE > to Ranch Camp ( JCC of < PROPMALE > ) , Tzipi and < PROPFEMALE > to Herzl ( WI ) with many of their Friedel friends . Big weight off my mind/shoulders ! 
Chag Purim sameach and Shabbat Shalom ! 
Getting the Passover plans put together , have several friends helping plan/prep/cook/fun ! Looking forward to another year of quinoa lice , ping-pong ball hail and chocolate frogs ! 
10 to 7 . Kids aren't up , I am messing around on FB and we need to leave in 25 minutes . Hmmm . 
oy , it is really that time already ? 
another day shot to hell , but not completely . :-) 
put one foot in front of the other , and soon you'll be on your way ...
