Suddenly feels like he is rapidly sinking to the bottom of the marianas trench 
is flabbergasted as to why the water in a bottle in the freezer isnt freezing , but the ice cube tray is rock solid ... did I miss something in science class or am I retarded ? I have a feeling that is going to be the highlight of my day ... 
is watching a < PROPMALE > and compelling documentary on squirrels in england 
is kicking asthma in the ass ! 
is wanting everyone to draw him a picture on the graffiti app ... so DO IT ! 
pondering why , before he woke up , there was a gun being held to his head 
is wondering where all the education went in this country ... and hopes that no one shoots him tonight .... I don't feel like dying again . 
just ate 3 egg rolls ... looks like an extra mile today 
ran that extra mile today !!! 
actually had some sort of a good day today 
smells something herbal coming from the apartment above 
Ong Bak 2 ? Heck yes !

Does anybody read books anymore ? There's no official books section on facebook or myspace anymore ( there is a comic books section on myspace , but I hardly consider that true literature ) and I constantly see grammar and spelling errors from so many people , most of whom are attending college ... Congratulations < PROPFEMALE > , we're officially retarded ...

Maybe it's a sign that I shouldn't be playing farmville at 4am , or maybe it's a sign that I should get some sleep so I have enough energy tomorrow to get a life ... yeah , that's it . 
Im going to Atlanta soon !!! Making that $krilla cuz ! Aaaaand , I'm about to find out when basic starts !!! So many things happening at once today ... Thank you Jesus !

I hope that I'm not harvesting < PROPFIRST > from my elephants in Farmville . 
running is no good with congested lungs ... but damn , Connecticut is beautiful . I want to own and live in a lighthouse out on a < PROPFEMALE > island like the one I saw today . 
I finally found someone that loves me unconditionally ... but its a cat . I may be on my way to becoming a crazy cat man ... any other crazy cat ladies out there that want to be crazy cat people together ?

I was purposefully almost hit by a car twice today just because I was riding my bike .... not cool . A bike has every much a right to be on the road as a car does , and in some cases , more so . So please be respectful of your fellow man , especially the ones improving their health and the ones not contributing to the nations addiction to oil .
