Got < PROPMALE > Grace in for an H1N1 shot at the Waukesha County mass clinic ( still haven't come in at our pediatrician ) , but advises anyone going to pre-print their form on one < PROPFEMALE > front and back , apparently printing the form on 2 < PROPFEMALE > s doesn't fly w/ the computerized system . So much for being prepared . 
question for those who are comfortable and confident in networking ( the human kind ): is it instinct and being comfortable talking to new people or can the shy among us work up to a confidence level ?

Decorated the Christmas tree this evening , unfortunately my strategy of keeping the ornaments out of reach of < PROPMALE > was nullified by < PROPFEMALE>'s removal of the mid-level ornaments .

Vikings lose a late-season game that the Bears almost let slip away . Both teams were who we thought they were .

Not exactly a defensive struggle in Pasadena . 
Time for the Big Ten to reverse the spin and say it's \de-emphasizing athletics to focus more on the student-athlete\ " . Or give the < PROPFEMALE > League champ a BCS bid next year . "

Let's go Saints !

The paperwork from Richmond finally arrived in < PROPFEMALE > , now I have my official Wisconsin PE license number !

Exciting US-Canada hockey game , great win for Team USA , but no margin of error over the next three games .

Whew ! Thanks for playing , Switzerland , you definitely made Team USA earn this one . 
Aldi cereal : The Master's thesis of piecing together American History from sugar packets . 
So far , so good for Team USA . Lot of hockey to play , tho .

Enjoying the Marquette radio broadcast team tonight . 
Nice win for the Terps . 
< PROPFEMALE > now wants to go to \FiveRuckers\ " . Might she be a future Mergers and Acquisitions < PROPFEMALE >?"

Enjoyed my conversation this afternoon with a < PROPMALE > Controls recruiter today regarding water project opportunities . Keeping my fingers crossed that something good comes from this .

Just read the issue of the Milwaukee Sentinel published on my date of birth thanks to Google News . 
Took the MyPath Career Themes assessment from MyPath/Manpower , says my highest scores are in Economic Research and New Product Development . Would have been nice to have taken this test at 17 , but results would probably be way different anyway .

Considering a LEED class to qualify for Green Associate Traning . Or is Project Management the way to go ?

To say that the first quarter of the Bucks/Hawks playoff was inauspicious would be a vast understatement . 
Phone screening with ATC today , hopefully said enough of the right things to move on to next round of interviews . 
From Fake AP Stylebook : infrastructure - To be used for public works projects and government property if no one knows what they're talking about . Sure , it's satirical , but there may be a challenge for us in the civil engineering/public works industry to further educate the public on what goes on when we design and build your roads , water treatment plants , sewer mains , and public school buildings . 
Hopes everyone in the Administrative Professionals profession had a good Administrative Professionals Day today ! 
Would be remiss not to mention Earth Day today , since Wisconsin's own Senator < PROPMALE > gets credit for starting the event . 
Cardinals take Badger standout O'Brien Schofield towards end of round 4 . 
Applied for a temp Engineering Supervisor job for the US Forestry Service . Thank goodness the application was online , I shudder to think of the irony of how many trees would have been cut down to mail the application . 
Just made plans to go to < PROPFEMALE > in 2 weeks to go to < PROPFIRST > Hight ' s graduation . 
Has a job offer in < PROPFEMALE > . Not with WisDOT or a civil consulting firm per se , but a project management job with a firm that performs high-tech transportation data collection and processing for state DOTs , utility companies , and other engineering clients . 
Has a bit of writer's block regarding what to put on my one-liners for my Jeopardy ! audition Tuesday ( want to use something other than what I tried 4 years ago ) . Any suggestions ( or what you might want to know about me if I get picked to be on the show) ? 
Thanks for the Jeopardy suggestions for tomorrow . Also , officially back to work as of Wednesday .

Hopes everyone had a < PROPMALE > to take in or participate in an appropriate ceremony today . 
So there you go , replay gives the Flyers a goal on a call as close if not closer than the play at first in the Tigers game . 
Ok , Flyers get a legit game-winner a minute after replay washes out what they thought was the winner . Now we have a series . 
Spent most of the day with the family , also working in time to run errands in the morning and reading about vocodors . 
Random thought : we have 4 TV news organizations in town , all with crawler technology for sports/weather headlines . Could one station try a \News Hour\ " approach where one could actually listen to a nuanced local news story with sufficient background information to understand what is going on ? " 
Give someone a fish , they eat for a day . Teach someone to fish , they eat for a lifetime . Teach someone how to get their own fishing show , better get a percentage of the gross . 
Hockey through the eyes of Lillian : the two most impressive things are the \orange-out\ " and the big < PROPFEMALE > Arches on the ice . " 
Early World Cup soccer on the weekend -good . Vuvuzelas ( I think that's what they're called ) at 7 in the morning - not so good . 
Milwaukee-area friends : if possible , try to check out today's JS front < PROPFEMALE > article on the city's education level . Of course , to sell more papers , they aren't publishing the article online today .

Also notes nice FD freebies from Bubba's Custard ( with e-mail coupon ) and the < PROPMALE > Davidson Museum . 
One last note : Best wishes to Pastor < PROPMALE > from our church as he moves on to retirement . The reception held for him after second service showed a lot of effort ( and our kids loved the cake and punch ) . 
So the Bucks take < PROPFIRST > Sanders . Over/Under on < PROPFIRST > Sanders Show jokes/meta in the area over the next week/month season ? 
Stayed up for Summerfest fireworks coverage on Channel 12 . It's a tradition , but I still wonder if it's because Summerfest is so important to Milwaukee or Milwaukee's a small enough market to air fireworks at 10:30 twice a year . 
Factoid : With Sen. Byrd's passing , this is the first time the Senate has not had a Byrd since March of 1933 . 
Up way too late with work things . 
Happy Canada Day from Gander Bay to the Yukon ! 
Now knows that Brazillian and Ghanian are off the menu for this month's World Cup-winner themed dinner club . 
< PROPMALE > Grace had a nice birthday today , although the downtown fireworks proved to be too much . 
Trying to figure out the odds of my line trimmer and lawnmower battery failing on the same day . ( Note : the push mower held in reserve for the tight spots and culverts came through , but it just wasn't exactly the easiest day to use it , temperature-wise ) . 
Noticed that the pies and cakes from the Elm Grove pie contest auction didn't exactly push the envelope in terms of uniqueness . Surely the contestants worked hard , just nothing really exotic . 
Seems like although it's been hot here , Wisconsinites have relatively little to complain about compared to friends back east . 
Strangely enough , the LeBron sweepstakes could at least make the day of at least one South Florida Realtor in a tough market . 
Trust Today's TMJ4 ... to set the gold standard for unintentional comedy in local coverage . Today's howler , an upcoming story on that \new thing\ " called \ " online dating \"." 
Having family fun with Wii Bowling . 
For NPR and football fan friends : for all of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s skill in recruiting , he must not have spent much time with recruits at the foosball table . 
Had a < PROPMALE > to listen to a < PROPFIRST > Kasem Top 40 show from 1979 today . Seems funny to hear the Bellamy Brothers and < PROPFIRST > Rabbit sprinkled in the first hour with the likes of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Worked on light housecleaning while watching last three innings of Nats game . Exciting stuff , I know . 
Enjoyed Thursday night church , especially getting to sing \Amazing Grace\ " to the tune of \ " Peaceful Easy Feeling \"." 
Welcome back to the booth , < PROPMALE > Uecker ! 
Had a good day in Chicago , didn't get to do much sightseeing but enjoyed some < PROPFIRST>'s chicken . 
Is proud of my wife < PROPFEMALE > . 
Although we don't have Chick-Fil-A in Metro Milwaukee , it is worth noting that two of my favorite local establishments are closed on Sundays . 
In yet another example of the randomness of kids , < PROPFEMALE > performed her own interpretive dance to \The Battle Hymn of the Republic \"." 
At the Farm and Fleet , not the Fleet and Farm . I'm still not sure of the whole backstory behind the split/difference . 
Will be presenting a \brown bag\ " session on how to get a Professional Engineering license at work tomorrow . " 
Getting ready to go downtown for the Arena Football playoff . 
So far , so good for the home team , they're up 44-33 at half . 
Unfortunately , TPIR fail-horn for the field goal kick contestant . 
Stunningly , no Violent Femmes on the arena playlist until deep in the 3rd quarter . 
And the road to Spokane will be taken by the Iron . 
Extra authenticity points for Conejitos in Milwaukee , the Tv is tuned to a < PROPFIRST > Azul vs Pumas match . 
Noticed something different tonight on Brookfield Road , a few sections of pavement that are temporarily sawcut for road repairs had alternating florescent pink and yellow stripes at the edges . I think it does a good job of capturing the driver's attention . 
Got to Zoo a la Carte just in time to hear the last Gin Blossoms song , but had to get meal for the kids , so the show was pretty much a washout for me . 
So now we know that Child #3 has an 80% percent < PROPMALE > of being a girl , given the ultrasound pictures today . 
It's that time again , about every other ad during the 9 PM newscast has been of the political variety . 
So Labor Day weekend here kicks off as if it were < PROPMALE > Day or maybe a nice Veteran's Day . To my friends and family back east , stay dry . 
C'mon , Tigers .... you get the fumble recovery and then just get a missed 40-something FG attempt out of it ? Meanwhile , UVa discovers a running game . 
Ok , that last drive for LSU was more like it . 
Just got back from Dodge County , < PROPFEMALE > , and Sunday School teacher orientation night at church . 
JMU-21 , VPI-16 , Final . Did not see that one coming . 
Ohio State could use some help in the punt coverage department . 
UVa and USC both missing chances to take the lead now . 
Nice UVa drive to get back to level against USC . 
Only down one touchdown , still close enough to rally in the 2nd half . 
is trying to figure out who to vote for in the Lt . Gov primary and the State Assembly primary . 
Could use a < PROPFIRST > King-style map right now to figure out where earliest returns are coming in , curious to see if < PROPMALE > and Kleefisch leads will hold . 
and Neumann's delivering the concession/thanks to staff speech . Meanwhile , it looks like it will be < PROPFEMALE > ( Kleefisch ) For Real getting the GOP Lt . Gov nod . 
Channel 12 breaking out the #s now , < PROPMALE > carrying SE Wisconsin 72/26 based on current results . That's securing your base . 
Other things going on tonight , so we can't attend , but want to give a nod to tonight's Brookfield East/Brookfield Central showdown . 3-0 vs 3-0 , let's go Spartans ! 
Heartbreaker for Clemson , another ACC loss , but at least I have Auburn in my pool . 
Well played , Sparty . 
So < PROPFEMALE > tells us that the map says that when you are 10 , you can travel to < PROPFEMALE > . Now if I just knew the exchange rate at that point in time to confirm that :) 
Good news : The Alaska crew will finish collection this week . Bad news : Time to send out my resume again . 
Question for non-engineering friends in particular : What do you find to be the most interesting or most mysterious aspects of what Civil Engineers do ? 
ESPN highlights the Tri-Delt house at SMU during tonight's game , that's a nice surprise for my wife . 
Six years of a great marriage ! Love you , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Hight ! 
Wonders if anyone's heard anything ( postive or negative ) about Zintro , where one can either register as a consultant or register and then use consultant services . 
Saw a couple of opportunities with Black and Veatch in Milwaukee today ... keep your fingers crossed . 
LSU football .... where bizarre happens . Or is it Where Coach < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > wins in spite of himself happens ? 
Interesting .. I think the Oregon band made an attempt at \Bad Romance \"" 
If the reports of < PROPMALE > Macha's demise are true , they probably would be completely overshadowed until about Thursday had the Lions pulled out a win today . 
Was available and able to explain to someone what the role of a contract City Engineer was today . 
Ok , how does LSU top the endgame in their next contest ? 
Auburn gets the close call at home , 17-14 Tigers in the 2nd . 
Keep it up , Longhorns ! 30 more minutes to play . 
Church should be fun tomorrow .. continuing the < PROPMALE > Tressel book study , but with most of the congregation happy Badger fans . 
Big hit for J Rollins , now back to NBC . 
Attended a City of Milwaukee Plan Commission Meeting because I was curious about one of the projects on the agenda . Had I known earlier this afternoon that it was National Community Planning Month , I could have attended in honor of the occasion . 
For Ranger fans : Sweet play by < PROPFIRST > Young to start the double play . 
Oregon clearly dispelling the notion of trouble for high-ranked teams on Thurs . night . They way they've been playing tonight , they still probably would have beaten UCLA by 3 touchdowns at the < PROPFEMALE > Bowl . 
Rangers must have saved up to get that much confetti . Big win for the loyal fans who have stuck with the team for years . 
Another LSU game , another LSU clock controversy , and it's only the end of the first half . 
Nicely done , Badgers and Missouri . Begrudging nicely done to Auburn as well . 
Should have taken the \over\ " on < PROPMALE > Fitzgerald references by local weathermen yesterday . " 
Finds it a little too convienent that Halloween weekend coincides with the last weekend before mid-term elections . Of course , if I had voice training lessons to become one of those issue group voice-over guys , I'd have a nice little side career this weekend . 
Cleared a lot brush from the yard today and saw the UVa game , so win-win today . 
Got a \ticket\ " from < PROPFEMALE > for \ " not letting her watch a movie\ " today . " 
Sees that Harley-Davidson is looking for a legal counsel in Milwaukee . 
Is it too early to say that I'm not running for President in 2012 ? ( At least not in the primaries . ) 
Watch those Tigers ! LSU fakes the punt for the first down , then gets a delay of game penalty . 
tries to remember our Veterans every day . 
Had a recuriter ask me if I knew anyone with Ohio PE status interested in working in Chicago . Let me know if you know anybody and I can try to help out . 
Will be presenting a seminar to South Milwaukee High School students on financial literacy for Make a Difference Wisconsin Thursday morning . 
Had a pretty good group of students today , hopefully everyone learned something , whether it was about budgeting or CDs or stocks or the importance of saving and investing . 
Sorry , Iowa friends , but N'Western wins with a hard-fought 4th quarter comeback . 
I think we can summarize the MNF game so far as blerg . 
Noticed a surprisingly high number of houses going in at one of my old subdivision projects . Wonder if the developer was able to sell a few plots or if they're feeling good about a turnaround . 
Took < PROPFEMALE > to the Milwaukee Public Museum today . Her favorite parts were the dinosaur videos , the butterfly exhibits , and the life-sized igloo . I liked the top floor exhibit of un-updated exhibits , architecture , and typefaces from the 60's and 70's .

Is rooting for Marquette today against UW due to proximity , though we have friends on both sides of the rivalry . As for next year , it may depend on what client base I have . 
Brenham , TX gets some brief screen time during Cam < PROPMALE>'s segment , but no screen time for Blue < PROPFEMALE > Ice Cream . 
Tried to distill 3 1/2 lessons into about 1 hour and 15 minutes for Make A Difference WI at Lad Lake school today and interviewed w/ an engineering firm across the street from where I was working in < PROPFEMALE > . Said firm does have a small Men . Falls office though . 
Knows that it will be snowing in Richmond tomorrow morning between posts from friends and Channel 12's Twitter feed . 
More networking tonight . I learned that Wisconsin has one of the more detailed guidelines for solar energy , and to smile more ( as part of a greater speech on likability ) . Oh , and one can buy a camo-covered NIV Study Bible . 
Is neither an Eagles fan nor a Giants fan , but gotta cue the Alcoa music for the end of that game . 
Pack/Pats finish reminded me of way too many LSU games of recent vintage . 
Tweaked my resume a little thanks to some tips I picked up on Friday . Check my LinkedIn profile if interested , there are some nice tools to put a resume up with Box.net . 
Has just enough of a cold that trying to read \Eloise goes to Paris\ " to the girls tonight made my throat feel like I moderated 15 rounds at ACF Nationals . " 
In the tradition of < PROPFEMALE > saying cute things , the other night saw her playing show producer . She said that < PROPMALE > would be put back on the show list \if she did her < PROPFEMALE > dance with Hello Kitty \"."

Nice to see < PROPFIRST > Summerall's annual appearance at the Cotton Bowl . Even nicer is how < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and company are working on A&M's offense . LSU might not even need < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > intrigue this time . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hight is here ! 7 lb . 9 oz . 21 in . < PROPFEMALE > and the baby are well . 
Wonders how the Bernoullis tried to explain to their kids how you don't need to use too much syrup to \cover each piece of their pancakes \"." 
Girls are excited to have < PROPMALE > back at home , but now to keep them from re-engineering the Cradle Swing ( TM ) . 
I have friends on both sides of the rivalry , but based on proximity to my hometown , I'm rooting for the Ravens today . 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Fedders for the delicious lasagna dinner ! 
Knows that government job application forms are thorough , but I still find it strange to have to provide my high school and \major curriculum\ " for such after having graduated over 15 years ago and when applying for a professional position . " 
Won't say much about the cold weather other than a ) It's not that much warmer in Chicagoland and b ) the cold doesn't seem to stop MSP from having white-collar jobs and a \creative class \"." 
Just saw the WBBM forecast online for tomorrow , still looks like Packers weather ! 
< PROPMALE > Hanie ? < PROPMALE > Hanie ?? 
The Packers should have won that game , but there just had to be a \whew\ " factor in the 2nd half . " 
Dear Architectural Digest : More architecture and planning , less photos of really , really < PROPMALE > people's houses . Thanks ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went to the Chinese Pagoda in Wauwatosa for lunch today . Although the price for the buffet was nice and they decorated for the Chinese New Year , the wood paneling , green booths , and blandness of the food made me think it was Year of the Rabbit 1975 instead of 2011 . 
I had a < PROPMALE > to ask former New Mexico governor < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > a question about infrastructure spending today via Twitter . He said that \Infrastructure spending must be determined by the States - they know what they need and where money must be spent \"." 
Lillian : Take a look at what I've packed for the picnic . \ 
Me : You have crackers , apples , tunafish , granola bars , cookies\

TMJ4 now showing a couple travelling by dogsled . 
Still wondering how Hupy and < PROPMALE > got < PROPFIRST > Shatner for their ads . 
Just participated in an ASCE LinkedIn group discussion regarding the lack of engineers in Congress , and by extension , public office . Any thoughts ? Any other professions that might be under-represented or perceived to be under-represented ? 
Just had a recruiter e-mail me today about an engineering opportunity in Saskatchewan . Fortunately , my interview for Friday is much closer than that . ( a firm in Milwaukee ) . Of course , if you know anyone looking in Sask ., let me know and I can pass info along .

Treated the bigger kids to sledding and lunch at Panera for < PROPFIRST>'s , < PROPFEMALE > picked out the card from the girls to < PROPFEMALE > \that had the most hearts \"." 
I'm keeping an eye on the federal budget discussion , but ultimately , I think it's up to the public to request infrastructure improvement at the local level ( excepting the obvious projects that fall under the cover of directly affecting interstate commerce ) . 
Bizarro state legislature antics must be slowly following me around , I was in Texas when Dem legislators fled to Oklahoma and New Mexico to protest the redistricting plan ( 2003 ) . 
Everyone enjoying Engineers Week so far ? 
Learning how to pronounce Chequamegon ( SHA-WAH-ME-GON ) . 
Given all of the hoopla surrounding Dr. Seuss ' Birthday , I'm thinking the Las Vegas Tourism Board is missing an opportunity by not talking up Dr. < PROPMALE > S . Thompson's Birthday . 
Wow , exciting times here in WI . I have my opinions about what is happening , but I have been trying to keep it off line given the balancing act of what I do for a living and the left/right balance of my friends and family . 
I'm looking forward to attending today's ASCE Wisconsin Spring Conference . 
Spring Technical Conference was nice , not as many networking leads as I was hoping for , but good presentations and a good dinner speaker ( < PROPFIRST > Gurda , author of \The Making of Milwaukee \"." 
Not the easiest draw for Marquette by getting < PROPMALE > in the 1st round . 
I think I have my 5-12 upset pick , Richmond over Vandy . 
Oooooh . Bucky draws Belmont . 
Documentary I'd like to see : how the \ad wizards\ " developed and researched all of the goofy insurance ads one sees on television nowadays . The Geico caveman and gecko seem almost sublime compared to what State Farm is doing . " 
U of R Spiders and VCU Rams in the Sweet 16 , way to go RVA ! 
Spoke with a Northwestern Mutual rep today to learn about their agent program . Not sure if it's the right career for me , but she did know an engineering firm VIP , so it was a productive networking day . 
Go VCU ! Hopefully it will be a happy day for Richmond sports fans ( and on a different level , Mizzou fans ) . 
Have a nice Opening Day . May the team of your choice meet or over-achieve your expectations for the season . ( Unless your team is in the < PROPMALE > East and located in the I-95 corridor and north of the Delaware House ) . 
Likes the idea of posting songs that link to specific events and anecdotes , but will not take the \30 Day Song Challenge \"." 
I see that at least some people at LinkedIn have a little too much free time on their hands today . 
For anyone watching out-of-state : Kloppenburg/Prosser very close , Kloppenburg up by about 5400 with 71% in . 
Note : a lot of the 29% of precincts still out are in < PROPMALE > County ( Kloppenburg vote ) , Waukesha/Washington/Walworth Co ( Prosser ) , and Milwaukee County ( depends on where in the county ) . 
Downloading HEC-RAS today , might as well try to fiddle with it in case it can lead to something .
