I can curl 15 now . It may only be half of what I normally do , but looking at the circumstances I think that its pretty good 

nice day out , suppose I'll play one or two hours of b-ball , then go for a four or five mile run , then moss springs to cool off , and to top it off , Sidewalk Days practice at Thompsons , fun day ... 
tommorow is Sidewalk Days , walking to Moss Springs after the demos , and a whole lot of fun 
the first demo was good , but number two is gonna be even better ! 
haha , had my first funnel cake today , demo was great , and the new sword form is coming along well , this day could not have gotten better , well maybe if it did not rain , but still , pretty awesome day 
do you think mma would be a good sport in place of football ? give me some opinions here ? 
just baked a strawberry cake with ceara 
uhhhhh ... summer reading for Mburg stinks , this book sounded cool , but is really really boring , I can not read more then five pages without falling asleep ... how am I going to finish this ?
