Well , this has never happened before . Somehow a wild bird got into our house and is now in our Christmas tree . 

is having her birthday party six days earlier this year . Earlier presents for her ! 
Ew . I just ran over a slug in my room with my rolling chair and killed it . :/ 
I JUST LOST THE GAME . 
Alright , a question for those who know Facebook better than I do : How do you send a private message to someone who isn't your friend ? I have been receiving some ... unpleasant messages from someone at my school who isn't even my friend on Facebook . I've already blocked him , but does anyone know how he could have actually done that ? Help ? 
Does anyone know when the next school break is ? I need a break really bad . :/ 
DO PEOPLE THAT TALK IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS REALIZE IT MAKES THEM LOOK MENTALLY RETARDED ?! I MEAN , DOES THIS LOOK INTELLIGENT TO YOU ?! 
is going to San < PROPFIRST > tommorow . 
Every time I come on here and see what people post I lose a little bit more faith in society . My generation is going to destroy the world . 
My bird has been on Facebook for one day and he already has more friends than me . EPIC FAIL . 
If you update your Facebook status more than five times a day , I can't help but assume that you are incredibly self-righteous . 
I just now realized that all my profile pictures have something to do with penguins . 
I just found out I'm going to have to have surgery . :| 
Sure are a lot of foreigners making fun of 9/11 on the internet today . -_- 
>:| 
LOL @ all the people thinking Facebook is going to start charging users .
