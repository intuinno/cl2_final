loves it when Jingle Cats and Who Let the Dogs Out play on iTunes DJ .

( insert vague statement here ) 
After going through MY holiday classics ( home alone , the < PROPFEMALE > claus , etc ) and seeing there always be 1 character who doesn't believe in < PROPFEMALE > Claus , I realized that their reason for not believing in < PROPFEMALE > Claus is the same reason that a lot of people have for not believing in God ... ... \He didn't give me what I wanted . \"" 
Laramie folk : have to get rid of our 32 '' TV and Malibu Pilates this week . Hit me up if you know anyone who would pay a little . 
So , I would like to test a playstation 3's DVD up-converting capabilities with my new TV to see if there is better upconversion out there , or if my expectations are too high . Does anyone have a Playstation 3 that I could borrow for , seriously , like , an hour ? 
DOPPLEGANGER !!!! ( circa < PROPFIRST > 2k6 ) ( thanks < PROPMALE > Gibbard ) 
Oh boy , what a night . 
... when i ripped the pop-punk i listened to in high school ( i.e. New Found < PROPFEMALE > ) , i knew that some day i'd feel like listening to it . that day is today . i'm just glad < PROPFEMALE > isn't around to call me a < PROPMALE > . 
i long for a job where i don't have to mentally correct my superiors ' spelling ... 
Attention Laramie friends : If you seem to have an extra ( or 2 ) grey Hanes zip-up hoodies , I think they might belong to me . I think I've left like 2 of them at < PROPMALE>'s house over the past month . 
... i just finished watching a Looney Tunes episode that ends in a double suicide . weird . 
oh man , Mass Effect 2 is as amazing as everyone says 
Question of the day : -What was your first concert ? Mine was < PROPMALE > G with my dad when I was about 11 . Mom didn't want to go and dad couldn't scalp the tickets . :| 
Question of the day : What did you want to be when you were a kid ? I wanted to be a trash truck driver . 
uh oh . This fanboy was not impressed by the 2 songs from Murder by Death's newest album ... P.S. apparently they played last night . whoops . 
-Question of the day : Which famous person would you like to < PROPFEMALE > out with ? -I'd like to < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ... when he was alive , that is ... not just his dead lung-cancer-filled body . 
-Question of the day : Being able to fly , or Being able to swim and breathe underwater ? 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and home-cooked buffalo wings . Life is good . 
Dear body , I have done nothing to harm you ( except maybe eating half a pie over breakfast and lunch yesterday , but that's besides the point ) . Please stop wreaking havoc on me . Keeping me up all night last night in agony should have been enough for you . Now , STOP ! xoxo < PROPFIRST > 
ol ' Knight ( lancer ) couldn't get out of the driveway this morning for all the snow . Now my boss is on his way to pick me up for work . DANG IT ! 
!!! NOW IN THEATRES !!! \ 
\ 
Every other freakin ' movie**\ 
** Featuring < PROPFEMALE > Johansson 
Help ! I need new bands to check out ! Anyone know of a band that uses a harpsichord/ old-sounding piano ? ... or just any good band at all ? SUGGESTIONS ! 
needs a better sun : wind ratio 
Season 4 of The Simpsons is more epic than I remember . 
telefictionary , anyone ? 
how do I say this without sounding like an idiot ... let's see ... \ 
ICP and Murder by Death have something in common . I think that both groups are trying to make up for years of not-so-happy music with a single try . \ 
Don't get me wrong , I'm not comparing their musical abilities ( ICP is retarded while MBD is the polar opposite of retarded ) , I'm just saying that even gold and filth can share common ground sometimes ... 
So , I go to my car after a long day at work , and my car won't move when put into gear . Crap , my clutch is out . Call a towing company , wait for 30 minutes , tow truck guy comes ... \ 
... turns out it isn't my clutch . Someone stole my passenger front tire and my hub was resting on their old crappy tire and rim . \ 
Thanks , white economy asian car driver ! 
The chemicals I used in the tire shop I worked in last year put a different finish on my wedding ring . I turned it into Zales for a replacement , but now have to go about a month without a wedding ring ... my left hand feels naked ! =( 
Shantana and I have 2 sets of golf clubs we are trying to get rid of ... a right-handed set and a left-handed set ... anyone interested ? 
just found out how to mass-rename files on his computer . \ 
Picture organization , here I come =/ 
With the wife at work , I'm once again reminded of how Trials may just be the most addicting game ever . 
Dear Discovery Channel , \ 
Thank you for giving us entertaining shark videos to watch as we lounge in our awesome hotel room . \ 
xoxo\ 
The Judkins 
Dear weekend , \ 
CTRL + Z ( in a good way)\ 
xoxo\ 
< PROPFIRST > 
... just finished < PROPFIRST > pilgrim ( the books ) . \ 
now , back to The Walking Dead ( the BRAAAAIIINNNSSS !!!! ) . 
can't wait to have a job I'm actually excited for :| 
Went to my first DESTRUCTION DERBY on Saturday ... and to all of my non-Wyoming friends : that isn't a big deal out here . They happen all the time . \ 
However , I felt myself giddy with boyish delight and thoughts of \BANG ! BOOM ! SMASH ! HIT EM HARDER ! \"" 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . the World : overall , excellent . VERY well done . Would've been a near perfect movie if there were a few changes to the ending . 
You shall build a turtle fence ! 
Goodbyyyyyyye neckbeard . \ 
Hellooooooooo Hot Dogs and Fries ! 
I'm realizing more and more that the Walmart ladder ends at a < PROPMALE > . 
I've just watched 7 episodes of Scrubs in a row . \ 
I'm sold . 
Shutter Island : Very Good Movie . 
500 Days of Summer : Very Good Movie . Very awesome and fun . 
Dear Jerkbags , \ 
If you don't know crap about your car , please don't pretend . Your car isn't like your dog . You can't just feed it lamb chunks instead of chicken chunks because ' that's what rover likes ' ( or at least you think he likes ) . Likewise , you can't put diesel oil in your 2003 truck just because you want to be like your stupid friends . Your truck is going to explode . 
I'm pretty sure the car ride I just had was directed by < PROPFIRST > Lynch ... I passed a kid ... riding a unicycle ... cradling a frisbee ... wearing american flag shorts ... \ 
Immediately after I passed him , I was pretty convinced he wasn't real . 
Driving to < PROPMALE > and back on the same day : BOO ! \ 
Driving to < PROPMALE > and back in order to pick up one's beautiful wife : YAAAAY ! 
Anyone want a ghetto bookshelf ( for free) ? 2 long , black planks of wood and 6 cinder blocks ! 
I've made a horrible mistake . 
... i love it when i can legitimately use the word \usurped\ " in casual conversation . " 
Observe and report : What . the . crap . I want my dollar and 86 minutes back . 
The people who were going to sublease our place just backed out . \ 
Anyone need a 2 BR place starting December for $530/mo ? 
Baileys . Fried Food . Now . Who's in ? Text me . 
< PROPMALE > Potter 7.1 : AWESOME !!!!!! 11one 
Anyone want to help < PROPFEMALE > and I move to < PROPMALE > next Saturday ? We need 1 more person ... 
So , < PROPFEMALE > not getting the job = can't prove we make thrice the rent = lose $800 security deposit = have to find a new place = go to < PROPMALE > today to find a place = find an awesome place that fits our budget well = SUCCESS !!! 
Black Friday score : Every DC animated movie for $2/each . Batman : Under the Red Hood , Superman & Batman : Public Enemies ... awesome for someone who doesn't have netflix . 
So , Shantana and I could really use a hand on Monday from about 10am-3pm ( in Laramie ) moving all our stuff into the U-Haul . We aren't moving to < PROPMALE > until friday or Saturday , but we have to be out of our place by tomorrow . Any takers ? 
... nothing makes you want to throw all your stuff away and live like they do in IKEA catalogs like PACKING AND MOVING 
So , it looks like the big move is happening SATURDAY ! We could definitely use a few more hands to help unload ( it's going to be annoying ) . So , if you're willing to go down to < PROPMALE > with us for the day , let me know ! We'll pay your gas and food . 
Just got internet hooked up . \ 
-The move went very well , thanks to < PROPMALE > A Lopez , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and Jedadiah Cracco . Preeeeetty sure it wouldn't have been so smooth with without those guys . \ 
-Started working at a walmart down here . It's a job . \ 
-Our place is AWESOME ! We'll post pics when we get everything organized . 
No , < PROPMALE > ... Just < PROPFEMALE > ... NINETY DOLLARS 
Saddest thing I've heard in a while : Toyko Police Club and Two Door Cinema Club just toured together ... through < PROPMALE > ... 2 days ago ... AND I MISSED THEM 
... it's that time again :\ 
1 . Home Alone\ 
2 . Au Gratin Potatoes\ 
3 . Christmas 
So , < PROPFEMALE > and I picked up Community season 1 for $12 on black friday , not really expecting much ... \ 
Oh man . That show is amazing . I went from somewhat enjoying it on the first few episodes to absolutely loving it by disc 2 and 3 . Highly recommend . 
Awesome Christms present : some random comic shop in < PROPMALE > having a 50% off comics/graphic novels sale . \ 
Picked me up the rest of the Sin City books that I needed ( 3-7 ) for $50 . Boosh . 
Making the slow change over to PS3 ... ' duckpants ' wasn't available , so I went with ' ductpants ' 
... is it melodramatic of me to say that I think wal-mart is taking away my humanity ? 
Soooo ... phone died . Sorta . Edit : phone in a coma that wakes up periodically and then goes back to catatonic . \ 
ANYWAY , if you need to reach me , text me ... or just contact < PROPFEMALE > anyway . Joined at the hip , anyone ? 
I'm now a PS3-only owner . It pained me , but the xbox 360 is now sold and out of my possession . Goodbye , friendly interface ; helloooooo blu-ray ! 
found 2 comfortable patio chairs at a thrift store today for $4/each . This place is home a little more each day =) 
Replacement phone acquired . Boosh . I love cheap phones . 
Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal ( one of the 2 webcomics I read ) has not been funny since the writer got married . Boo . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Tenney , < PROPFEMALE > Tenney ... Got home from work yesterday and the wife was already finished with 2 discs of Glee ... I'm 3 episodes in , and damnit ... I'm hooked too . 
< PROPFIRST > Lawrence-Amend , < PROPFIRST > Teske ... You guys both live near each other . < PROPFEMALE > out already . 
Man , I could really go for a Honkerburger right about now . 
Teachers on TV shows are horrible . All of them are always in the middle of a lesson when the < PROPFEMALE > rings to dismiss class . What ill-preparation ! 
Albuquerque must have one freaking confusing intersection , considering a certain cartoon rabbit continues to make the incorrect left turn . 
Since we're all telling cold weather stories ... I left a can of coke 0 inside my car ... and it exploded . 
Birthday's on Saturday ... Preeeeetty sure I'm going to watch the < PROPFEMALE > Wars trilogy and eat an entire pizza . 
Thanks , everyone , for all the birthday wishes ! This whole weekend was spent simply lounging around and watching movies ! 
Mama say . \ 
Mama saw . \ 
Mah ' Mamosa . \ 
( it makes sense when < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > backup singers say it ) 
Holy Lord , \Airborn\ " is on instant queue . \ 
Just got netflix . Just found out how to watch SNL circa 1994 . \ 
Oh man . 
Mystery Science Theater 3000 : How can the jokes made about the movies be so freaking funny , and EVERY joke made outside the movie is rubbish ? 
SNL : season 21 . It's really awesome seeing Will Ferrell show his range , before he realized he could play the same character in every movie and be a hit . 
I'm pretty sure I watched more \I Love Lucy\ " as a chubby teenager than I'm comfortable to admit . " 
Daybreakers was a surprisingly good movie . What are we at ? A solid 2 good movies about vampires ( I'm lookin at you , blade 1) ? 
Expuberance : The satisfaction of knowing that 13-year-old you would be happy with how things turned out . \ 
I just ate pizza and french fries for breakfast .
