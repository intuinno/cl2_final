As the seconds of what futures exist draw nearer , I cannot help yet to feel as though we are firmly set upon the bottom eyelid of some maternal or paternal < PROPFEMALE > ; who , as their seconds approach our centuries , feel the urge to blink , far too early , as we - excepting the cognoscente - antagonize unduly the divine cornea .

Playing bass . 
If you must compliment yourself , then your validity is questionable . 
Some flagitious , linguistic acrobatics and a handful of cultured antithetical contemplation . Need I say more ? Kiss the comma , you know you needed it , nebbish . 
It is both medially entertaining and , to a greater partial , somewhat melancholic to see so much foolishness in one , cooperative conglomerate . 
Playing bass ( Chromatic Fantasia , J.S. Bach , & You Can't Hold No Groove , V . Wooten ) and reading on Disjunctive Syllogisms . I probably should be brushing up on my mathematics skills , au contraire . Which reminds me , I'm also skittering across this asinine AP French packet .

Cello Suite in G < PROPMALE > , a cup of tea , and an illimitable bastion of poetry ... now , if I had a life , this scene would be complete . 
The average being cares for situations causally and conditionally ; this is little compliment to the destitute it aims to aid - for what genuine sparks of organic life are conditional exclusively ? I live unconditionally , no matter what spontaneous factors rise or fall , provided they are not fractions of my life force itself . A trophy sought for effort or affecting of emotions is a token for one's carapace only . 
Is that right , now ? You had intercourse ? You altered your consciousness ? You ruined your components ? Where were your achievements when your psychedelic wings deteriorated with sobriety ? Your dignity ? Yes : make it , it's all you shall possess in due time - machinated dignity , our most decadent yet . 
Not radical enough to conform to non-conformists ; not concerned enough to be a ' nerd ' ; not mindless enough to be a ' teenager ' ; not awake enough to ' succeed . ' I suppose you could call me a deadbeat among the motley , if you wanted to remember my colors .

I've all the time in the world , and plenty to pass it with ; for some reason , all my science drives me to , at the bottom , pass with it nothing . What is wrong with me ? What is wrongness at all ? Perhaps a physiologist could tell me why my organs like destruction , why I burned those most significant to personal dust ; all my philosophy , thought , and ruminations have failed where I think nothing may succeed . 
To what should I relinquish my bearings ? To nothing , to nowhere , to -- no one ? Catch here this river wreath , as I fling it far upon the wind's stride , with the momentum of a graceless fall . 
The longer you prevaricate , the longer you have to fear the needle . 
Home is in sight , Angel ; hate me a little less , or pretend to , mayhap , while you follow the path of the innermost arm of my trident : ignore my horns , my encroaching , beastly marks ; if I must remain without your company , then I should revel in sending you to safe arms .

To cradle one in your mind is not like your arms ; to shelter them in a heart , no matter its puissance or fragility , is not like your arms .

Night is a time for brooding .

Today I received , for my ' efforts , ' the National Presidential Scholarship , worth $ 50,000 total , accumulated in occurrences of $ 12,500 per semester , on the basis that I , throughout my ' high-school career , ' have so ' focused ' on my education that -- on the highest margins measurable -- I so dutifully ' applied ' myself to a percentage not even a fraction of the totality ; ... 
The Anti-Christ rears his sleepy head , coarsens the tidal mass's linens with a gentle roar , denaturing the nature , devaluing the values ; and , like a hibernating copse his leaves steady , the sky emboldens with dusk , and the tweeting creatures depart : he falls dead . Poesy bear him witness . Philosophy bear him witness . - Witness shall bear them none ! 
I would beseech my heart for a compass , / yet it gave back only its moving tiers - / By looking , distraught , in my spirit's tarn / Learned , the face had I been for all these years . 
I go to bed , dying still , with little minds quoting bigger ones in song ; can you not quote your own - and not just so , but with expressiveness , with precision ? Any thing is prejudged in its constituent things , and all things are not necessarily a certain way , but , by necessity are any given certain way . And you still have yet to delineate the arteries .

THE RELIGION OF RELIGION , a comprehensive , beginning-to-end , non-fictional treatise which shall ILLUMINATE and EXPOUND FULLY UPON the purpose of religion , why it is , how it became , what it's becoming , WHAT it TRULY is , and how no contemporary ' religion ' is a religion - it is now being written ; -- scorn it , for my enjoyment ; -- the time has come to dispose of belief , and engage in the revelry of KNOWING .

Pistis toward Noetic thought ... and Gnosis began ... 
The greatest metaphor for life is that ... the essence thereof is much like the concept of dawning a splendid bravura - an elegant dress , a lofty suit - and making in the locality and environment the most choice of choices , and among those Mysteries of life , adding to the fatigue of the weary , careworn threads among your vestment ; and , at death , with our wisdom alone , we throw ... this tired suit , and find another .

Shamatha is the one-pointed mind , the focused , diamond-like , persevering mental body of shi-ne - it is silence ; it is the first step toward Samadhi : utmost ecstacy , and perfect self-understanding . 
People suffer continuously and many expect them to wait for a solution to their ailment ; one who suffers does not want to , and sometimes cannot , ' wait . ' The truth is , steps to the solution are readily available , now - one need not ' wait ' until later . This is Gnosis . This is practical living . 
We confess to living ' the life , ' or a life bountiful in bliss , and in the same moments complain or reproach within this very same vehicle , through which we are given such abilities ; nay , we live by remembrance , and thus we live not at all - for never has an image ' lived , ' and only until we fearlessly face the Inner Abyss of memory shall we live only in the fleeting now .

We spend years earmarking faith and filling our fairweather pockets to their brims with it , only for it all to fall out in the brambles ubiquitous on the earth . The fact of the matter is , there is no existent merit for cultivating faith in mere belief exclusively . When we engage spirituality , rather than scrutinize or peruse it , and entertain it through all facets of life , we sow faith of the heart , not the pocket .

Our most devastating blows are oftentimes our most crucial edifications - fruits in a poison's robes . Many a time have we fallen in the crevice of a dire , saddened earth , and have emerged triumphant and inspired by low-lying , moist , life-giving soil .

How can one live without noticing how stupid and inconsequential ' existence ' is ? Look at our photographs , our inventions , our ' values , ' our beliefs - they are all hilarious , useless , and mean on the smallest level nothing .

People rarely ever mean what they say . If they always intended well , there would be no need for language . Truthfully , the development of language only shows how far lost the zeitgeist is in the abyss .

There is so much discord and so many absurd conjectures based on the subject of love , and love lost , that it has given the sentiment a bad name , indeed . The fact of the matter is that the greatest majority of those who contribute to this body of ill disposition toward love are those who tragically misunderstand the subject to begin with .

And when the hyperborean came from her cavernous grotto of meditation , she noted that the world had suddenly become baseless , and inundating , and vitriolic , and full of thievery . In her eyes , she shined within the gloriole of her obtained logos ; but in reality , she had become more base and far less Zarathrustran than the thoughtless . And she desired . And she failed , and suffered . In the following years , she rejoiced . 
As long as there is suffering , -- \

And never cross over into Nirvana . 
Lo ! and through failure , the Hyperborean became a prophet . She spoke the tongue of the universe and bore proudly her cachet of wisdom . Others soon failed in her wake , and they did not become prophets , or wise , or erudite , or edified . When the Hyperborean saw this , she said : \Woe to the one which casts her or his self into the murk of the deep ; a dish is served by means greater than which is seen upon a plate . \"" 
If in my fortress -- and , thereby , hers -- she has < PROPFEMALE > to what idiosyncratic preference whatsoever , and I shall surely and singularly receive it graciously . That is what , I believe , true love enables and entails . 
I am no poet , but I should like to be . Poets have a comforting tendency to do everything in even more anonymity than the average person , especially die . In fact , our greatest poets have usually only been discovered a century or two after their death . Perhaps they are ahead of their time , and thus die in the future . This is paradoxical , because most poets suffer an unbelievable burden in their present .

To be incredulous toward the efficacy of the liars , and the callous , and the unsympathetic , to increase our capacities is a poor thing , indeed .

One may be either brave or ignorant in believing in love . Brave , for there exists so much evidence against its validity and puissance ; ignorant , for the same reasons . I consider myself a brave idiot .

Running from Miss < PROPMALE>'s , you showed up one day . \ 
From a flat in South End where you made me strong\ 
You said , \We're burning out at both ends . \ " \ 
Time to study the elegant dance of < PROPFIRST > . 
Got an angel on the stairs\ 
( as if you'd even care)\ 
When the lights are up , \ 
and the sun has nearly gone down . \ 
\ 
Did you see him on the street ? \ 
Did you pass him at your feet ? \ 
Did you think aloud , \how dare they \ 
When they pumped out your guts\ 
And filled you full of those pills\ 
You were never quite right\ 
Deserving all the chills\ 
They say the worst is over\ 
Kicked it over and ran\ 
Then they ask what went wrong\ 
When they turn you on again\ 
They turn you on again . \ 
I remember running through the wet grass\ 
and falling a step behind . \ 
Both of us never tiring , \ 
Desperately wanting . 
It wasn't baroque , by\ 
any means . - But\ 
perhaps (,) that is what\ 
it means ? \ 
That\ 
a simple chain\ 
fell to my heart when\ 
I adorned it - I adored it ;\ 
that a chain , \ 
simple , \ 
like our time's passing , \ 
is the last to\ 
hold not our hearts , \ 
but them together . 
I don't want the world to see me , ' cause I don't think that they'd understand . When everything's meant to be broken , I just want you to know who I am . 
Home for the weekend . Text . ~ 910.416.1967 
My email hasn't been functioning well recently , so I have not been able to email Mr. O'Neal . If someone can ask him if he would be interested in letting me come in and do some creative writing / interpretation courses , can you do so , and thereafter let me know what he says ? Thanks . 
O ! by your < PROPFEMALE > I sadly , deeply so , \ 
-- while it dies there , forlorn in window -- \ 
Wish my heart you'd pluck ; bow my dreams so true ... \ 
For the < PROPFEMALE>'s bloom , -- any sound will do . 
I will see the day I die many times before I see the day in which I put my trust in a single person . 
It's < PROPFIRST>'s Day ? What ? When did that happen ? O , today ... right . 
It was Outside when I realized it was Night ;\ 
' twas Night when I realized I had become those lips :\ 
devious , dolorous , ephemeral , dishonest ... \ 
morosely lambent , just beyond the watershed , \ 
just beyond Home . May it nudge your vessel , \ 
and rusticate you to some em'rald field , as in Rome , \ 
far , far from Here : happy , < PROPMALE > , and Outside . 
Napping . Up at 5:30 . 
I'm up . 910.416.1967 - text if you need me . 
Should I end this night with readings on mathematical fictionalism , Beethoven and Gliere practice , or some Tibetan Book of the Dead ? Discuss . 
I hate dyslexia . And early mornings ! 
Spend your time earnestly tracing your failures , and you shall be drawing your success . 
Probably going to extend my practice time to 5-7 hours a day . I won't be available often . Hah 
The most quaint article of morbidity is that , despite invoking disgust , or fear , or vexation , and the like , it is often the only audible call to contemplation for mankind . There are few things as versatile as morbidity - it is a necessary grace , a mysterious sheen of mortality , a feared interloper , a writer of novels , the deific hairs of a painter's brush ... without death , perhaps we would lack our greatest triumphs . 
Out . Text . 910.416.1967 
Very ill . 
Fear of unreturned feelings has left many in stagnation , and thereafter a cyclopic desperation . And , oftentimes , this happens , time and time again , as the fearful sits in favor of the known corner as opposed to the unknown corridor beyond , and loses its newest loss . Fear truly is the strongest of human emotions so frequently ; does \true\ " love always triumph ? " 
You'll always have one companion in life : you . Treat them well ; you never know how long they'll stay around . 
< PROPFEMALE > is dictated by mindset and translated by action . 
Taking a nap to hopefully make practice more effective . 
Hunger . 
Are we human , or are we dancers ? \ 
My sign is vital , my hands are cold - \ 
And I'm on my knees looking for the answers . \ 
Are we human , or are we dancers ? 
There's nothing very interesting around when not behind a plane of < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . It's the most fantastic terrible agony . 
Nap time now - then more practice when I wake up 
When there is no trust to be found in people , we are blessed with everything non-human . I happen to have 88 special friends . The best thing : they only speak when I want them to . 
O , blue rain ! keep to your clouds , your < PROPMALE > / - ( We , in living , have broken someThing's heart . ) . - . 
Flying to your neck , \ 
unfelt , but sculpted in \ 
her face , all the damned \ 
mystery ; ah then \ 
but by your grace \ 
I should - no ! - must rejoice . \ 
For here , my answer , \ 
my still dancer . 
Glancing over More Than Words . 
Going to see a play at 8:00 . Afterwards , it will probably be some more guitar practice , or maybe piano . I'm weeks ahead in piano , so I have a certain breadth of leisure ; but this also denotes that I simply have more to practice . We'll see . Text if you need me . 910.416.1967 
Two monsters of modern education : oversimplification and comma splices . One is collateral , the other : consciousness at work ( by not working ) . 
Going home for the weekend . Text if you need me . 910.416.1967 
Back on campus . Sleep , then piano . 
Love : it will lead us not astray . By fate we all shall die , one day . 
Going to nap for a bit , then practice some more after , I guess . 
Lying down for a nap before practice . Text me if you need me , though . 
A lesson in human nature : the greatest enemy of the proofreader is the absence of errata . 
Back to practice as usual . 
Mankind has yet to learn the subtle < PROPMALE > of language - ergo , trust no one to her or his words . 
The basic syllabus for the course I may be teaching at Massey Hill has been completed ; if you're interested , let me know , and I can message you a copy . I will most likely be teaching this course through Mr. O'Neal's AP Language and Composition class , and Ms. Czechowski's English III class , although anyone not enrolled in these courses is encouraged to attend in person or online . 
Nap , then practice . If you're interested in participating ( whether at Massey Hill or online ) in my creative writing , interpretation , and philosophy workshop , check my previous status for more information . 
Going to practice in Reeve's . Also : I am now taking poetry requests ; if you want a poem on a specific topic , in a certain style , & c . & c ., send me a message and I'll have one done as soon as possible . 
A dog is not considered a good dog because he is a good barker . A man is not considered a good man because he is a good talker .  
I must say , the most productive of all aesthetic and intellectual paths - which I should note I appellate so arbitrarily - have that characteristic , sometimes baleful - adverse , even ! - section in which the tyro , driven by a resolve unlike that of the unvariegated zeitgeist , have strayed from the warily apparent signposts ; and , they have , most admirably , taken up , within a germinating soil , a path of autodidactism ... 
Sick 
Violent Femmes 
Back to World of Warcraft , aha . 
My best friend , < PROPFEMALE > Coad , departs for Germany tomorrow , and I shall miss her dearly . But , we shall meet again , perforce ! 
Not programming today . Playing guitar . Text me . 
Going to try and tackle the Tocatta and Fugue in dm . 
Nevermind , I really need some rest . Napping , then Tocatta . Text if you need me , though . 910.416.1967 
And falling a step behind\ 
Both of us never tiring\ 
Desperately wanting\ 
They turn you on again . 
Nap , then practice . Text if you need me . 
But I don't\

like a graceful God without\

Let the countdown begin . 
I've always been and always will be an idiot ; I just practice expressing it in different ways . 
Going to teach a piano lesson . If anyone is interested in taking lessons ( as of now , I do them for free ) please message me , or text me . 910.416.1967 
I'll return shortly . 
Look for Love ? Nay ! It is hard to find , and nonplussed , and unschooled in the ways of Emotion ; and , for sake of Time -- whom we owe our reciprocation of her or his blessing of Space -- we should not succumb to folly , and forget that Love , indeed , is devious , and hard to find : -- and , for sake of ourselves , we must move , not hopeful -- as Love's lenses are infinitesimally small -- but cognizant , of Love's finding us . 
The integrity of an argument ultimately does not lie in its form , but by what it represents . An argument is a pure suitor which speaks from conviction , not from circumstance . 
Practicing . Message for my attention . ~ 
Let us meditate on our sufferings . Even should we run out of all other lessons , suffering always remains . 
Piano . 
\Something goes in this song -- as Night 
How easily does it begin ? - chewing a toothpick , rewriting words inside-out to be meaningful to careless eyes , assaying by essay to say how long I have longed , how difficult the difficulty a difficult life brings - chewing a toothpick , popping a taut spine , and lying cruciform along an axis of bark-covered words falling in a proverbially silent < PROPMALE > . It does not begin easily . 
I suffer heavily all miseries until I am quickened with the emboldening psalm you chisel in time by all things done . 
I have to play a recital tomorrow , and now my Reynold's , scoliosis , and Sydenham's Chorea all decide to go spastic on me . This verily hurts . My song is going to suck tomorrow . Om mani padme hum . 
About to dig into someone's faulty laptop , get the thing backed up without turning it on , and wipe it completely via booting straight from a CD thru the BIOS settings . If you need me , text me , until further notice . 
Almost done backing up the essential files . I am back now , for all intents and purposes , however . 
We spent some time -- ours ! -- rising\ 
... \ 
\ 
together , and anxious at heart ... \ 
I fancy now that Time's\ 
breath-veiled weep must < PROPFEMALE > t -- \ 
somewhere , amid Love's eternity , -- \ 
Current in a tear stream\ 
to sweep one's Love to sea .... \ 
Caring more , I blind these young eyes , \ 
searching in < PROPFEMALE > faces for thee . 
Going home until Sunday . 910.416.1967 
If anyone is in at least one of Ms. Czechowski's classes , could you ask her if she ever received my proposal via e-mail ? Thanks . 
I'm falling even more in love with you \ 
Letting go of all I've held onto \ 
I'm standing here until you make me move \ 
I'm hanging by a moment here with you \ 
I'm living for the only thing I know \ 
I'm running and not quite sure where to go \ 
And I don't know what I'm diving into \ 
Just hanging by a moment here with you 
Ready to play Voodoo Chile tomorrow . ~ 
To live as if youre dying is to live with an objective in mind , even if the objective is no objective  thus , it becomes easy to cling to , this cyclic operator ; ergo , it is much more sufficient , and fulfilling , and joyous , to live as though you are already dead . 
That's precisely what we need in modernity . More generalizations . Especially this one concerning generalizing . 
\So 
Logging off for the night . You're welcome to text : 910.416.1967 
Behold : I am not for the populace . By the Way shall I disappoint others , as they are bound by subjective inebriation , a stupor borne paradoxically by the objective . The objective is just so , but only by malignant design . Thus , by the Way , I shall disappoint , and transcend in the presence of nothing . 
I'm in love with but one ; it shall persist forever , no matter what consequence presents itself . Like all true love it is independent , and free from primal force . It is a sophisticated affection : infinite profundity , infinitely profound - without borders , without center . The only thing better than this love , is for it to be coupled ...
