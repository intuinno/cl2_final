I love Creative Writing . Why ? Aquatic squirrels , awkward squirrel imitations , awesome handshakes , demon voices , evil hiccups , terrorist hand sex , ninjaness , incredible soxyness , and just overall blasphemy . (: 
Should finding a nice sketchbook really be this difficult ? :/ 
Maybe going to the movies later ? (: 
Got back from seeing \How To Train Your Dragon\ " a little while ago . (: " 
I have recently become strangely obsessed with the band Enter Shikari lately . Why ? I've no idea . :/ But they are pretty amazing . <3

Wow . That was uncalled for and incredibly innappropriate . 
Getting my braces off on MONDAY ~ :D

Shh ... Do you hear that ? That's the sound of forgiveness . 
Llamas + hats = God's tears , gender confusion , and tummy rumblys only hands can satisfy . 
A surprisingly good day . (: 
\That was more staring into a cat's eyes while he's takin ' a piss than I ever wanted to do . \ " ROFLMAO "

I have just discovered the awesomeness that is Blassreiter . (: 
LOLOLOLOLOL . Oh , Sebby . Just because you find 32 random kitty-cats out in the woods does not mean you can hide them all away in your room so Ciel doesn't find out . (: 
Working on < PROPFEMALE > Bartee's Kuroshitsuji poster , and I must say , it's lookin ' pretty schnazzy ~ ;) 
SCARE TACTICS . <3 (: 
Bad day . :/ 
): 
Just finished cutting my hair . It looks pretty schnazzy if I do say so myself ~ ;P 
1 out of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly a minority , put down , given bad labels , left alone , and so much else ... all for something they didnt ask for . Many gay teens are turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them that life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy/paste this . Most of you wont , but lets see the 5% of you who will . ? 
Apparently , if you die for school spirit , it counts as a good cause . So , if no one sees me during or after Multiplicity Day , blame Maddi McLean Denten . 
I miss my old hair . ): 
“The open-minded see the truth in different things : the narrow-minded see only the differences . ”

I hate it when you're trying to rendezvous with fellow mercenaries and then a giant robot spider comes chasing after you and right when you're about to reach the rendezvous point everyone in your party decides to die and then the inevitable \Game Over\ " screen flashes before your eyes . -_-;"

Put this as ur status if ur against bullying

Allergies suck pineapples . 
This is starting to piss me off . All anyone seems to want to talk about now is drama this and drama that . Really ? There are more interesting things to talk about than something someone said yesterday that pissed you off and now you've got your panties in a knot about it . Seriously people , grow up and stop being so friggin ' melodramatic . Is it really that hard just to laugh it off and get over it ? >:| \

Awesome . Didn't win anything . Not even an \Honorable Mention . \ " \
