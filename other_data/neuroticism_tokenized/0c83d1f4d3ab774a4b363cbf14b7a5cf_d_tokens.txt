Having a party at my house Tuesday !!!! 
Party at my house Tuesday ! Starts at 8 pm !! 
Got the fire going and everything is set !!! YAY time to party !! 
Last night was a blast ! Included very interesting things such as < PROPFEMALE > car bombs , the discussion of getting unmentionables stuck in a steal trap , and a very drunk dog who likes her alcohol . Oh , and why am I up at 9 am ? Because I am the man , that's why ! LOL , love to everyone !! 
Just got home ! Driving 5 hours wears a person out ! 
I'm up , but I don't want to be ! Oooohhhh back to school , back to school . 
Studying .... plan on making it a long night/morning !! 
So I found this site that helped me identify over half my bugs last nigt . Let me know if you would like the link ! 
Still have a lot to finish ! Ugh I can only blame myself ! 
Had no electricity last night , so it sure cut my studying time down . 
Is all hopped up on caffeine , and likes the saying \cuz I'm bluffin with my muffin\ " Tee < PROPFEMALE > bah ha " 
Is working away at her paper !!! I seriously need to change my hobby from procrastinator to overachiever !!! 
So entomology is the study of insects right ?

Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments . 
All of this lovely slow has resulted in my car stuck on a hillside . No damage though , thankfully . 
Happy Valentines Day to all my friends !! 
Hanging at the house and contemplating ......... 
Just posted pics of our new doggy !! 
Relaxing at home and enjoying my day off ! 
My new doggy's farts smell really REALLY BAD !!! ha ha 
Off to work hopefully , if I can make it out !!! 
Ran out of water today ....... you'd think that unlikely with all the f-ing snow on the ground !! 
water today and satellite tomorrow !! YAY 
I'm so fed up with everything going wrong !!! Today was a horrible day ! 
Today marks a year that my parents were taken from me and my family . To remember them I'd like anybody that knew or met them to comment about a fond memory , or their meeting . 
Stupid rain , I know its good , but i want to be outside !! 
yay , i've lost 10 lbs ! 
Don't know why I'm up so freakin early ! But I will be playing with horsies and cows today , then time to party , whoo hooo . 
wednesdays make me smile :) 
Had a crazy busy day at work today , did not help that I had a long night , but it is all worth it to be there for family and animals . 
off to work ! 
Did not mean to take a 2 hour nap , it just happened . Glad this week is over . 
I just love it when my dog pokes her wet nose in my face before my alarm has gone off . :) 
I hope to catch my < PROPFEMALE > this weekend ! 
It is about to storm like hell .... :) 
hoping for a nice calm day at work ........ ha yeah right ! 
I still have not caught my < PROPFEMALE > , not even sure if she's still around . :( 
Saw a sighting of my cat , so at least now I know she has not run away . Now I just need to catch her ..... hmmmm 
Just got home from work . Got ice cream cake and a candle from the girls :) Thanks guys ! 
Back to the clinic until noon , then its time for some rest , whew this has been a busy week . :) 
I'm gonna complete this day by working on my application :) 
Might be going white water rafting Sunday , : ) !! 
Heading up to Fayetteville this evening after work , then hitting the rapids tomorrow !! 
Had a good time on the water yesterday ! White water rafting is definately a good work out , pretty sore today ! 
Work until 2 . Wondering what the clinic has in store for me . 
Lost a special member of my family today . 
I have a special kind of family , lol : ) 
When will the crap stop piling up ? 
Today was supposed to be the beginning of the end , but I guess I have to wait a few more months :( 
Ready for some R and R with the best ! 
Let's see .... what could make my day a whole lot better ? Day says , \how about getting stung in the forehead by a hornet and having half your face swell up ? \ " Not exactly what I was going for . : ( " 
Still very swollen today , seriously have to strain to keep my eyes open , I'm gonna start telling people < PROPFIRST > beats me . 
work , then out with the girls : -) 
running on a small amount of sleep , going to have to do some serious napping when I get home . :) 
mmmm steak and mashed potatoes :P 
getting very disheartened about vet school :( 
Remind me not to plan things , they always seem to get ruined :[ 
work till 2 , then I gotta go through my stuff for a yard sale ! 
hmmm ... things could get very interesting .. 
Good day at the yard sale with Steph , back at it again tomorrow :) 
Loves the Drive-in , and thinks it sucks that it is now closed until next summer . 
wants everbody to go to www.wwwdotcom.com :) 
Things are starting to look up for my applications :) OH yeah , and WVU better get with the freaking program !!!!!! 
COME ON EERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!! OVERTIME BABY 
Sorry , not this time < PROPFIRST > , WOO HOO !! 
Ahhh , don't know why I woke up 40 minutes ealry . Feeling kind of hyper . Where is all this energy coming from ? 
Just putting the finishing touches on my supplemental applications , transcripts are on their way , and I'm feeling a little less overwhelmed . :) 
Did I mention that I love fall ? Let's Go WVU ! 
Had a good night with close friends and good music . :) 
Off to work for a half day , then hopefully I'll get some stuff done around the house . 
It's Saturday , that means I'm off until Tuesday . :) hope everyone enjoys their weekend ! 
Who would have ever guessed bowling and pitcher margaritas do not mix very well ? 
My mother always told me to treat others the way you want to be treated . Well I know I do not treat people like crap , so why do I get treated like crap ? Tired of getting walked on ! 
Exhausted , but hey the yard is now both weed eated and mowed . 
Both my phone and cell phonw is not working , so please contact me on here if you need to . 
Yay , my phone is finally working again ! 
To the owner of the red siberian husky puppy around my neighborhood-Why the hell did you pay hundreds of dollars for that beautiful dog if you're just gonna let it run up and down a busy part of route 5 ? You're lucky it wouldn't come to me , but somehow I feel you wouldn't miss it that much otherwise you'd take better precautions !! 
Today , some justice will be served , but not nearly enough ! 
< PROPFEMALE > crap , tonight is going to be awesome !!! 
Happy Halloween to all my friends and family . :) <3 
Saw christmas decorations on my way home . Is anyone else thinking way too soon ? 
My elusive feline has finally been captured . YAY 
people are freakin heartless and retarded !!! 
Happy Thanksgiving . Mmmmm can't wait for good food ! 
what a trying day today , I'm glad its all over ... for at least 30 years anyway . 
Change your profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . We are hoping to not see a human face on facebook until Monday Dec 6 . Join the fight against child abuse and invite your friends to do the same . Copy and paste as your status 
shitty shitty shit shit ...... thats how I feel 
4:30 is way too early to be up !!! 
message me a number 1-3000 and I will tell you what I think about you . 
# 1- you're a dork because you actually messaged me 1-3000 instead of a number between , so I am designating you # 1 because you are my bestest friend in the whole world , and I love you like a sister and would do anything for you . You're kind and caring and not afraid to tell me your true feelings :) 
#41 You have a great personality and it reminds me of my roots because of your similar natures . You've been there for me through what I am going through , and I am so sorry I have not been able to help during your time of need . You share the same compassions that I do and I love you and your other half very much ! 
#13 We've had our ups and downs :) , but since we've been out of eachothers breathing space its been all ups I think . I really enjoy partying with you and appreciate every little favor you've done for me . You've been a good part of my family and I love you :) 
#7 / #3 I don't know you very well , but you take great care of a certain loved one of mine and I can rest at ease knowing that she has such a true friend like you . I love that you are very compassionate about animals , and I hope one day I will know you better :) 
#69 Of course you would choose this number , and that is why I love you so much . You are crazy , but in the greatest ways . I really miss you and I wish we could < PROPFEMALE > out more . You are a great person to vent to , very trustworthy , and very caring . I'm also sorry you feel I gave you bad luck . Love you ! 
#6 I think I still have a lot of stuff to figure out about you , but I think you are an awesome person . Your energy makes the day enjoyable , and I am so glad I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with you at my party . You remind us all that we should take excitement in the smaller things in life like hot guys in big trucks , or a favorite song coming on the radio . :) 
#3 or #5 or #35 or #8 You are my sister , I love you very much . I love your free spirit and your devotion to many good causes in the world . Sometimes I know we dont always agree on ways of living , but I don't think either of us lets it bother us . But I will always be here for you if ever you need me because family is most important whether blood related or not , right ? 
This has been the crappiest weekend ever !!!!! 
Lets see if I will make it out for work , should be interesting !

< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > \\m/ 
not feeling so hot .... it better not be the start of that stomach bug ehhh hemmm .. * cough * < PROPFEMALE > * cough * 
somehow , my brilliant blind pooch , managed to shut herself in my bedroom sometime between this morning and my arrival home . 
Tired of being sick :( 
I am from another planet . You will never understand it . We are a race that likes to acquire things . 
Got some meds in my system , hopefully I will be back to 100% in no time

Happy St. Patricks day to all my friends and family :) 
Its St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day and I don't even get to go out :( 
Awesome night !! \\m/ :O 
You know I think its really shitty that through a break-up you realize who was truly your friend and who was just your friend because of your significant other . Even people I knew before the relationship haven't spoken to me . But thank you to the people who have continued to be my friend . 
Love thunderstorms <3 
hmmmm 
Played me some guitar hero last night for the first time in awhile . Oh yeah , I still got it ! ;-) \\m/

interested in what today might bring :) 
Still looking for a roommate . If anyone is interested , or knows someone who might be , message me for contact info . 
off to work until 2 ..... joy joy 
So let us melt , and make no noise , \ 
No tear-floods , nor sigh-tempests move ; \ 
' Twere profanation of our joys \ 
To tell the laity our love . \ 
Moving of th ' earth brings harms and fears ; \ 
... Men reckon what it did , and meant ; \ 
But trepidation of the spheres , \ 
Though greater far , is innocent . 
Some people are just ignorant . Go ahead and keep on living in your fantasy world . 
Let's never do this day again . Agreed ? 
work until noon , looking forward to tonight :) 
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence One step from lashing out at you ... You want in to get under my skin And call yourself a friend I've got more friends like you What do I do ? Is there no standard anymore ? What it takes , who I am , where I've been Belong You can't be something you're not Be yourself , by yourself Stay away from me A lesson learned in life Known from the < PROPFEMALE > of time 
New Game : There's enough history between your friends that something reminds you of them , a song , a movie trailer . So , if you like this status , I will find a youtube video to post on your wall that reminds me of you . Afterwards , copy & repost so I can do the same . 
<3 Loving this gorgeous day <3

< PROPMALE > is gone and Kohana is in da house :) It means swift , I like the sound of it and it fits his intelligence . 
Two weeks until I get to see my <3 FAMILY <3 !!! 
Uhhh , mother nature , in case you weren't aware , it is May now . The excessive showers are supposed to stop to make room for all the flowers . 
Now that the sunshine is back I am going to take this opportunity to go hiking on the Hill in Millstone with Kohana :) 
Had a really great visit with one of my parent's friends who I hadn't seen in a long time :) 
YEAH ( french ) TOAST !! \\m/ 
music+book+outside = near perfection ....... a fire would make it perfect :) 
why is the rum always gone ...... because I keep drinking it :P 
work until 2 ....... ah I love my Tuesdays 
blah .... how am I supposed to walk my pooch in this weather ? 
But baby , you hardly even notice when I try to show you . This Song is meant to keep ya from doing what you're supposed to . Like waking up too early , , maybe we can sleep in . I'll make you banana pancakes pretend like it's the weekend , and we could pretend it all the time . Can't you see that it's just raining , there ain't no need to go outside . 
today work ... tomorrow work .... and THEN Black Stone < PROPFEMALE > !! 
So apparently I got free gasoline yesterday :P ...... oh and I saw a bobcat this morning .

Go away rain , I would like to have a fire if its not too much to ask . 
Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers I know and love . Love your mother all the time . You only get one , and they leave us much too soon . I love and miss my mom everyday <3 
Going for a 4wheeler ride on this gorgeous day .......... can't wait until next weekend !!! 
Man I have so much to do today ..... mow the lawn , lay out in the sun , go 4 wheeling , and sit by a fire ..... I don't know how I'll ever get it all done . Loving my country life <3 
Work was really good today :) 
You admire me , I know you do . Even if you don't like me ! You know why ? Because I take the lemons of my life and make the best damn lemonade you ever tasted . 
Ok people , so I really need a roommate . Even if no one within my friends is looking for a place , please help me spread the word . Ask your friends , etc . Guy or girl will do , and bills are cheap :) 
Work today .... picking up the sibs tomorrow , then camping alllllll weekend :) 
Going to take a nice jog with my pooch <3 
packing up .... be off into the woods soon enough <3 
Camping until Monday <3 , I actually get service up there so HTC :) 
Well camping was interesting to say the least ....... I think I'll lay off the Sailor < PROPFIRST>'s for a bit :P 
rain , you are about to make jogging even less fun than it already is :( 
So ... the person that I was planning on going to the Seether concert with , can't come . So I have an extra ticket if anyone wants to go with me :) 
Work until 5 , then VACATION for a week !!!!! 
Let the vacay begin and the countdown to ROTR start ticking !!! 
I just absolutely love smelling like bleach ...... damn you poison < PROPFEMALE > , you have won this time . 
ROTR here I come !!!!! \\m/ (>_<) \\m/ 
Went crowd sufing for the first time ..... HELL YEAH !!!! \\m/ 
Lessons learned yesterday ...... 1 . fat men and women should not crowd surf , they will hurt you when they land on your neck and smash your head into the rail . 2 . If your on the rail , security is your friend . 3 . Form a bond with those around you quickly . 4 . You can't go all day from 9-7 on a granola bar and water in the hot sun , you're BG will drop . READY for round 2 ? I got this . 
Got to grab the ass of the lead singer of 10 years ....... ok not grab , but palm it as he crowd surfed over my head . :P 
Layed down to take a nap , woke up saw that it was almost 7 , freaked out because I thought it was 7 am tomorrow . Haven't been that disoriented in forever . 
walking my pooch <3 
Can't hardly turn my head this morning ..... I'd like to meet the girl that landed on top of my neck and punch her in the face . 
Apparently no onions also means no lettuce or tomato . done with this day , next please . 
cosmo and blackberry icecream <3 
I think I'll get my fishing license today <3 Definately need a lake trip soon ! 
drink a little drink , smoke a little smoke ..... campfire smoke that is . Camping out with Shawni and < PROPFEMALE > tonight :) 
Ahhh fishing <3 
Looks like I'll be tearing the rest of my ceiling tiles down in the living room and dining room , since half of them decided to fall down last night :( 
Oh Lake Sutton , I have missed you so . I will see you in a couple hours . :) 
really wishing I could talk to my momma today , could use her advice on sooo many things :( 
Hmmm , never had a bomb threat called in on a concert before , but hey there's a first for everything , and the show must and did go on \\m/ ... <3 SEETHER 
going to go enjoy the warm breeze and watch the storm roll in <3 
up this early ? On a Sunday ? WTF ? 
Grilling out this evening <3 
Seriously reconsidering my love of walking around barefoot after killing that baby copperhead last night . 
I just love getting chewed out for something I didn't even bring up :/ 
It's a < PROPMALE > dancer's choice my friend ; better take my advice . \ 
You know all the rules by now and the fire from ice . \ 
Will you come with me , won't you come with me ? \ 
Whoa - oh , what I want to know-oh , will you come with me ? 
Well its that time of year again , when the splooge trees are blooming ..... makes driving with the windows down a little less pleasant . 
I'm So EXCITED !!! 
Just got skype , we'll see how this goes :P 
So much can be said through silence . As hard as it seems , all that we need , is too close to be seen .... Our lives , you build your walls for me to climb . A billion walls for me to climb . 
I'm gonna explode like a firework ..... kapoohie ..... then what ? 
Your strength is determined by the experiences you have had , the hardships you have endured , and the people who try to bring you down . MAN AM I STRONG ! 
Yay , I finally have a roomie !! On the downside Kohana killed one of my neighbors chickens :( 
Its days like today I wish I either had better tools , or a man who knew what the hell they were doing when it comes to fixing mowers . 
I got the letter C\

jogging with Kohana <3 
Friends stay with you through thick and thin , they don't let you blow away ... they try to comfort you when your hurt or down . That's what a true friend means ! 
So even though I'm not so happy I had to clean off a shredded rabbit on my porch .... I can't help but be impressed that my cat can take down prey the size of her . 
Home from work late , so no jog with Kohana .... * pouty face * 
Off to Pburg for the whole day ........ :) 
Two truths and a lie .... 1 ) People think I'm younger than I am by my looks , and older by my personality . 2 ) I can't stand kids . 3 ) I could live where I am for the rest of my life . Post what you think is a lie . Then repost as your status .

There's a point in time where you realize you're giving wayyyy too much credit to someone you thought helped you through the rough times of your life . But looking back , it was all me baby ! My own inner strength is what overcame . They were just a crutch that kept me from healing sooner !

I love the fall for sooooo many reasons <3 
Working as a painter today had me thinking about < PROPFIRST > all day . Not just because of the tasks I had to do but my employers treated me exactly how he would have treated his employees . Never worked them too hard and lunch was always on him or cooked by my mom . Great day <3

Seems like as soon as I get used to all the new stuff in Facebook , they change it again ..... eh so far I like .
