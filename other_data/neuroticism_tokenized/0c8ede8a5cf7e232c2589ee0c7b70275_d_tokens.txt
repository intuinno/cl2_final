Of all the things I've lost I miss my innocence the most / slipping through life's challenges like hot butter on toast / mmmm that makes me hungry maybe I should eat / so then maybe my tummy would stick out further than my feet / when I was young I used to take straws and put them in my nose / my daddy told me not to he's really smart I suppose
