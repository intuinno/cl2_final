Having a good conversation with Thunderf00t and JRChadwick 
I have an idea for to stop the BP leak . First dump large amounts of debris ( such as large rocks ) on the leak forcing the leak to split into weaker and smaller transport route between the oil line and the open ocean . Second Cover the outer layers of the rock with a thick layer of hydralic concrete . A larger amount of concrete and rocks holding back weaker streams of oil .
