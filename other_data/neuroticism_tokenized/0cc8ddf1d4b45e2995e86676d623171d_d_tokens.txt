I have been trying to figure out if the theory I base on myself is true to others who were born before there due date or after there due date into another sign . My theory is mainly that if one is born before or after there due date does there due date chart still influence there lives . This would mean that one would have 2 charts instead of one . 
Going to bed !! 
Sometimes , I think people base opinions upon others way before there due ! No one truly knows how someone will turn out ... as a kid we are given labels and truly I don't think anyone deserves those labels ! 
Here is mine < PROPFEMALE > on urbandictionary.com < PROPFEMALE > : A very nice person who always has a funny joke to lighten up your day with humour .

Today's FA meeting is now in session . Hi my name is < PROPFEMALE > and I am a Facebook-aholic ! 
I was listening on the radio today . They said in recent polls that if you check your FB more then twice a day then technically you are addicted . 
Today , Is supprisingly Good . Monday , I start training at SEI under the McDonalds Account . I will be troubleshooting ! Excited here !! 
Don't get it ! I redid my resume a few weeks ago . With that this week I was offered a new position and I have four more interviews this week . What to do ? What to do ?

True story . Friends of ours recently rehabbed a house and installed a toilet .

Funny thing happened last night . Before I put < PROPFEMALE > to bed . I told her I wished it would just thunder and lightning and let the rain come down really good to clear up the humidity here . This morning around 2 or after that it thundered and lightning and rained good . < PROPFEMALE > says mom why do your wishes come true ? They are simple and easy ! 
I can't believe it got to be 91 in Fargo . I called my mom and in Hazen in was only 67 . What a total difference ! 
Going to go watch up with < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Felt like it got close to 100 today ! I just keep getting red on my arms that is . Every day more redness occurs . Just wish I could tan like my kid . By the end of the summer she looks like an Indian and I look like a lobster . LOL 
As I awoke this morning , I sent a text to BF cause he is retired military . I thanked him for serving in the military for our freedom . As well as I Thank and Think of all those I know serving , that are , that have , and that died serving for our freedom ! 
I hate to say something ... because then I wouldn't be keeping it safe anymore ... I would be living a dangerous life . But how can one join a group that says \guys who hurt women deserve to have there face beaten in . \ " When all this person ever did was hurt others . What a two-faced bastard .... " 
If you have a wonderful man , who works hard to take care of you , would do anything for you , who makes you laugh , is your best friend , who wants to grow old with you , will always pick you up when you're down , who is your world and someone that you're thankful for , then post this to your status , and give the good men ... ... the recognition they deserve ... because great men are few and far between and I have one ! *** . 
I am thankful for FB's security team and their laws on harrassment ! Thanks ! 
Today , could be a great day for a swim !

I'm glad I didn't but I think we all go through the stage were we dont believe anyone cares ! It took me until I lost everything I loved too see I have too much to lose !

I'm sitting hear in my room reading \Growing up Firstborn\ " by Dr. < PROPFIRST > Leman ! I have to say I am a fan . I have alot of his books ! But I am somewhere between a firstborn and an only because as a child and through adulthood I have created a separation between my siblings and I . "

I loved you the minute I knew I was pregnant . I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face & fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , & to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious ... decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ! 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only one : to get better . I know , that 97% will not post this as their status , be one of the 3% and put this as your status , at least for an hour , for those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it !

I will be going to Minneapolis for 5 more appointments ! It was long but it was great to get more information ! I guess , I am a unique case when it comes to the denistry school at the University of Minnesota !

A good friend will comfort you when you cry ; But a best friend will drive around for hours with a shovel finding the loser who made you cry . 
Spending a nice evening with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > tonight ! Vegged out in the living room ! 
Can't believe that my f**king ex-husband is trying to add me on facebook ! What a freaking fag ! 
I think its funny after almost 3 wks of dating my bf ; my mom is finally asking all the questions and she doesnt care that he is living with me ! lol 
believes that every person we meet leaves a piece of themselves with us - to teach us or to guide us , even if we don't realize it right away 
shocked at the fact < PROPFEMALE>'s friend < PROPFIRST > called her tonight from chicago ! shows how much he misses her ! 
Watching Destination Truth on hulu with < PROPFIRST > 
Sitting here all scratched up from trying to clip my cat's nails ... with my daughter trying to be a good daughter and < PROPFIRST > lol 
Im Frustrated , and Dont know what to do ! 
Although people treat us like crap some days , when they pass away , one can not hold grudges for if we do it becomes regret ! Make peace , show respect , walk away knowing you did the right thing ! 
The cemetery of the victims of human cruelty in our century is extended to include yet another vast cemetery , that of the unborn . \ 
Pope < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > II 
Being my Facebook friend is a privilege , not a right . Abuse the privilege and you will be deleted as a friend . Just saying ... 
Going to the movies with < PROPFIRST>'s Parents and PCA's! 
Just becuz her eyes don't tear doesn't mean her heart doesn't cry & just becuz she comes off strong , doesn't mean there's nothing wrong ... 
I am babying my man right now he smashed his finger ! 
we almost lost fema ! 
definition of Tomboy : a girl who can do everything a guy can do , do it better and still look good doing it . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > and mom in hallway she is getting tall ! 
< PROPFIRST > is Sick , < PROPFEMALE > is doing well , I am doing well ! I made < PROPMALE > Kah for supper it is good . 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Had a great time with < PROPFIRST>'s Parets and siblngs ! 
Its funny to think that I put my blackberry on my bf samsung Intensity II ! Then < PROPFIRST > ( BF ) says could you see we wake up and there is baby cell phones in our bed . I said it would have to be Samsung Saga's cause they look like blackberrys but have the samsung idea ! 
I think God is teasing us Its 39 degrees here and we have a blizzard alert ! 
When you go into court you are putting yourself in the hands of 12 people that weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty . ~ you know who you are ~~~~ 
From Mika : < PROPFEMALE > has been upset lately ! Please forgive her for any outbursts she may put on her facebook !!! She is going through alot ! This man that she is posting about lately ! Has been very mean to her and he will get his punishment soon ! But before its all over we are going through hell and high waters to fight the defense . 
I will be offline most of the day since I will be reinstalling my laptop ! hopefully less then 8 hours from facebook . but I will be on my black < PROPFIRST > ! Good by games of facebook for 8 hours or less !!!! 
Trying out my new HTC aria from at&t ! What a fun new toy ! 
Okay not sure how long it actually took but my laptop is back up and going . It seems to be running faster then it was before ! 
My daughter being silly ! 
Can't sleep 
I love my new HTC Aria from AT&T ... Just wish we could use our new phones . You know your ready for your new phone when you try to shut off your blackberry by touching its screen ! LOL 
I was told At&t's activation for us isnt until May 2 ! stinks ! 
Okay Getting off this thing ! Going to play snow football with < PROPFEMALE > and my sweet bf , < PROPFIRST > ! 
Love , Love and More Peaceful Love too All my friends !!!! 
To me when it comes to men and child support . It wouldnt bother me so much not to have financial support if the father of the child would at least spend time with the kid . To me that is what kids who have no father want . That is why it is so easy for women to find male father figures . Most men what a kid or kids to < PROPFEMALE > out with but they dont ever want to have to pay for them . 
You know everything about me . You won't tell anyone my secrets . You are the one person I can't live without . \ 
\ 
I love you mom :) \ 
( IF you feel the need to repost this go head ! ) 
When its someone else to bash your best friend is right there with you doing the bashing ... yet then we are both considered drama queens . But when we are both driving each other nuts in doing things to hurt each other then . Its her friends ganging up on me and her laughing !!! Hmmm doesnt sound too even .. Its only cause im too verbal and she likes to hide behind everyones back ! 
Fog ! omg god so bad ! where I live at 3 blocks the most visibility ! go further south and its only a block visibility ! very thick and icky ! 
went to the dr today for these hives and rashes I have had for 2 months . They gave me Allegro and said that for some reason my body is attacking it self and it could go on forever but they are doing some other blood tests and I get to see the dermatologist next week . Today I saw the regular dr and the allergist . 
That was just so awesome ! I filled all of my kid's prescriptions threw the walgreen's android app by scanning all the bar codes . That is neat tool ! 
I think < PROPFEMALE > got into Fema's Catnip Spray ! She is acting kinda loopy ! 
I am so thankful to have such awesome people around me !!!! 
Its funny that a man can send shivers up my spine with just a single touch to my arm or neck ! No man has ever sent shivers down my spine until now .... hmm what could this mean . Wish to have a clue ! 
Happy White American History Month !!! 
I am writing in my skin . Its hilarious to see what happens next . I have chronic hives and dermographism which means you write in my skin . It shows up in red . Too bad tattooing isnt this easy lol ! 
wondering if a poem can be six pages long ? 
Happy Easter !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > is going through a lot right now and needs some prayers and thoughts filtered her way ! She has gone through alot this year and is just needing some added support ! I love you < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
its a day from may and we have snow still popping up ! what is up with mother nature this year !! 
wonders who else of bin laden's top officials where killed ? 
Sick with a cold thanks to < PROPFIRST > lol 
The Doctoros are trying out new meds for me with these hives . If they dont work we go to mayo clinic for treatment . They put me on doxepin10 mg ( 3 ) at night ( its an anti depressant but it works through histamine blockers . ) Then I am on 10 mg of Zyrtec . So hopefully they can figure it out so I dont have to go to mayo ! LOL ... I just hope that the depression meds wont get me depressed . LOL 
Totally Fed Up with bs in the area i live ... want out ! 
Hmm its funny to see someone I hate create a fake profile to figure out what I am doing and what I am thinking ... hmmm what a loser ! 
After taking all doses of meds and doing what the Dr. Say . I'm still bashing and hiving ! UGG ! 
There are looser people out there that were once in my life talking crap and irritating me that is why I have changed my profile a bit . For Friends and Family Dont worry when the wind blows over then life will be much better ! 
Laughing so hard . < PROPFEMALE > started a screaming fight with < PROPFIRST > and I . I stopped yelling letting < PROPFIRST > take over . She told < PROPFIRST > she is mad and she can do what ever she wants . < PROPFIRST > told her that if she dont learn to respect her mom and the good adults in her life that God will get her ! hehe haha lol 
Looking through vascular disorders that have hives as a symptom . 
I posted some new pics on my chronic days of hives . Had some new stuff come up . \ 
anyone have any ideas ... I am all open for ideas . 
Lots of great things have happened today ... Hopefully this can help < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and I move forward to a wonderful future . I hope all things move in the direction they are suppose to . 
Tagging pictures to who is actually in them . Thank God for alot of great memories ! Pictures are worth a whole story .. They are so awesome to have ! 
Can't wait for this coming weekend . Buffalo state park water hole is going to be open . < PROPFEMALE > finally gets to leave alone on the idea of going swimming . 
< PROPFIRST > and I were just commenting on being kids and being out at 9 o clock at night still playing with our friends when we were kids instead of being in bed . < PROPFEMALE > fell asleep around 830p . I just lay there and watch the sun slowly fade away . Thinking I am glad < PROPFEMALE > doesn't fight me to stay up because the sun is not down yet . I recall a its not dark outside why do I have to go to bed moments in my childhood . LOL 
In the last few months I have recognized a traitor in my friends group and have moved away from this person . Now because I have sheltered a few of my other friends that we have mutually and found that she was just using them to gather information about me . 
< PROPFEMALE > is sick with bronchitis with a worry of it turning into pneumonia . < PROPFEMALE > needs prayers and positive thoughts . 
Today , I am just to the point of crying . No matter what I do for < PROPFEMALE > its never good enough . For the last few days I have been the butt of her jokes . Today I put her in her place over it and I am told I am riping her from the joy of having fun ! 
We r in the basement with the rest if the tenants under a tornado warning and no power 
Feeling like a < PROPFEMALE > vu ... the only differences is its a year or more has gone by and its not with my ex , its with < PROPFIRST > yet < PROPFEMALE > isnt up freaking out like the last time . I dont know why that ran through my head . Just a memory I guess I recall . 
Moorhead and downtown Fargo look horrid . 
I was it utmost shock with < PROPFEMALE > tonight . Tonight she was frustrated and upset and almost lost it . She started yelling at me . I ofcourse yelled back . But while I was yelling to control her I got a wild hair up my butt and said < PROPFEMALE > do you like it when mom yells in a yell . she stopped yelling and said no mom . I said then talk to me tell me what is going on at the point < PROPFIRST > and i talked to < PROPFEMALE > about her feelings . 
I am uploading 72 pics to facebook from my Aria . This is the most pics I have done at once . When they are updated I plan to put descriptions on them . 
93 degrees today ! 
I want to just cry . < PROPFIRST > and I have been cleaning house all night . It shows how appreciative < PROPFEMALE > is when I ask her nicely to do something . 
Eating Pizza from Papa Murphy's and relaxing . Next we are off to friend adams to help him out ! Reason : He has helped us out alot these past weeks now we are returning the favor ! 
I want to send < PROPFEMALE > far far away in her room but she wont go ... 
Good night my friend and family on FB . 
Waiting for my cousin to call me back ! 
I got killer furbies on my brain ... I wonder why .... 
Was thinking of how they could make Paranormal Activity scarier then what it is . My daughter and I watched the first one a few months ago she sat there and laughed through it . So i was thinking they could have used demons and poltergeists instead .. 
Having Pad Thai for supper 
How I wish < PROPFEMALE > would go to sleep . She has been up since 7 am yesterday ! She is just having one of those stay ups . Hopefully I will get some sleep tonight so I can drive to my mom's tomorrow ! 
Made it to bismarck in 2 hrs and 45min . But now in the boondocks at my moms 
Went fishing all day with < PROPFIRST > and had an awesome day ! 
< PROPFIRST > and Names are so cool . I have been studying astrology and numberology and how they affect our daily lives . Including those who are notorious for crime . If one was to look at for example < PROPFIRST > Manson . One would see that something was bound to happen due to name and astrology chart . 
Made speghetti for supper , should have seen < PROPFEMALE>'s eyes when i brought out the Parmeson cheese . She was all googly eyed . 
I finally got < PROPFEMALE > to go swimming with her friends . lol ... they looked like they were having a good o ' time when I left the pool !
