Why is it hard for some to pray ? Why is it so hard to repost the gossip ? Why can people worship a celebrity but not Jesus Christ ? Gonna ignore this ? Afraid to get laughed at ? Most of you won't repost this ... The Lord said if you deny me infront of your friends I will deny YOU infront of my Father !!! I repost this ... Will you ? 
G . P . A is now 3.41 !!!! 
Most women WON'T re-post this : I am a HANDFUL !! I'm strong willed , independent , a bit outspoken , & I tell it like it is . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control & at times hard to handle , but I love & give with all my heart . If you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . If you are a HANDFUL , re-post ! I dare you ... I'll be looking for the ladies who re-post 
If your Daddy is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best Daddy ever ; Whether you are blessed to still have your Dad with you or if he is an ANGEL in Heaven ...
