I SURVIVED ANOTHER DAY OF RAIN , WIND , AND TORMENT ! 
As you know not every bird can roam the sky , I see your wings bird , but .. can you fly ? All I see when I look down , Something jumping on the ground , Scratchin ' at the dirt ; cluckin ' in the barnyard , Tell me could that be you ? In the that case lay another egg , Tryyy to save yourself from the barb-e-que . 
Sooo uh , heard any < PROPMALE > Winker albums ?

I haven't seen Hurt Locker , but it is up for many academy awards . The makers of the movie claim that it is very hyper-realistic , but many veterans from middle east state that the movie is a sham and fails to be realistic in every shape and form . http://www.aolnews.com/opinion/article/opinion-why-veterans-arent-buying-the-hurt-locker/19385403 
An undertaking that redefines genocide , a bomb is dropped on the innocent countryside . They said we'd be safer , they lied , as we rest our gaze upon the molested cow hide . We tried and tried but the angry man of the olden presides . 
Being sick sucks .

So , uh , anyone hear about revolutionmuslim.com telling the creators of South Park that they'll kill them if they ever show anything that pertains to the prophet , Muhammed , again ? Prett scary stuff . I wouldn't have shown it but apparently , on a poll I found on Aol.com, 92% of thirty-something-thousand people would have shown it or not have censored the episode . 
I am just getting all nastalgic up in this mofo ! \

< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim : 7 out of 10\ 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was an ok movie , with it's creative < PROPMALE > direction , humurous scenes , and good action sequences , but I , personally , did not see the greatness in it . The main element of the movie that contributed to my rating the most was the use of < PROPFIRST > Cera .

I don't believe it . That idiot , < PROPFIRST > Brown , is governor and people like my next door neighbor are not going to be able to live comfortably with the property taxes that he is going to raise . 
Any of you who voted \yes\ " on 25 should be ashamed of yourself . " 
< PROPFIRST > Brown is also going to raise income taxes , sales taxes , and DMV fees . He is the second worst governor to run california and he did it THREE TIMES . The only person to outbeat him on being the worst governor is Gray Davis . \
