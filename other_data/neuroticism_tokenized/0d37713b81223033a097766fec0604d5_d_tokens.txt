is reading book 4 of the Twilight series . So far it's pretty good . Obviously , I love < PROPMALE>'s P.O.V. the best but why are his chapter titles so long ??? 
has finished \Breaking Dawn \"!!!" 
thinks if I would've just read pt . 3 of Breaking < PROPFEMALE > that I wouldn't have had to read all that Bella/Edward/Jacob nonsense . Some say it's about the journey vs the destination but pt . 3 of book 4 really does sum everything up w/out anyone having to waste

Going running running running . Putting in my 3.5 , taking a shower , going to work . 
At the library chillin ' ... I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than to be in a place surrounded by books , peace & quiet and best of all the only other place besides a movie theatre where it's rude to be loud .... 
Cam't sleep !!! Why does the Sandman deny me so ?!? WHY I BEG YOU !!! WHY !!!

Listening to that new Jay-Z/Alicia Keys song New York ... I'm sorry but everytime I listen to this song I get inspired to get on a stage ( any stage ) and interrupt someone's performance ... LAUGHING OUT LOUD @ Lil ' Mama !!! :-D ))) 
Real quick , this has been on my mind since last night ... So < PROPFEMALE > gets a papercut , right ??? Why didn't she just suck on her finger or run to a sink to wash the cut like a normal person ??? Why did she just stand there and bleed all over the carpet knowing damn well that < PROPMALE > has issues with self control ??? Just sayin ' ... 
@ The library ... There's something about silence and books that just does it for me ... 
I'm really glad that Facebook < PROPFIRST > is back to normal . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Rivers 
I do not want to go to work today . I couldn't even get in a good run this morning ... Fuckin ' snow ... 
What to do . What to do .... I'm thinking about seeing Sherlock Holmes . I dunno , we'll see ... 
Hey everybody , it's your girl , ~ PAM ~ , wishing everybody a SUPER DUPER HAPPY NEW YEAR !!! 
I'm doing something I never thought I'd do again ... I'm gonna join a gym . I love to run but if I'm going to be remotely successful in this marathon coming up in April , I gotta cross train ... 
@ my mom's making t-shirts .... OOooh , maybe I display that as a \talent\ " for our big meeting at work . Does anybody think I can get < PROPMALE > to wear a shirt that says \ " Pam is the best teamleader I've ever had\ " ??? LOL " 
Today is \Tuesday Movie Madness\ " day . The Book Of < PROPMALE > & The Lovely Bones are on todays list ... " 
Today was day 2 of shopping for nice clothes to go out in and today was a complete failure . I dunno , I guess I'll find something otherwise my heels and my hair extentions is what I'm rockin ' this weekend ... 
m Day 3 of shopping : I finally found a dress to wear to the party . Life is good ... For the moment . 
Today everything just got on my f*cking nerves . Gonna wind down with a little Zombieland then off to bed .... 
I love clothes shopping online ... There's no lines , the store is never crowded , no one is asking if they can help you every five minutes and if you know your size there's no need to try on clothes .... 
HAPPY ST > PADDY\S DAY EVERYBODY !!! " 
This shit is elementry school . I'm ' bout tell this bitch to meet me on the playground at 3pm !!! 
Went to a Drag Show last night and it was awesome !!! 
So this really cute guy was in < PROPFIRST>'s yesterday and all I could do was look at him from afar and wsh I had the balls to go talk to him . I can talk to anyone about anything no matter how difficult but I can't walk up to a dude and say \Hi my name is Pam ... \ " I'm such a puss !!! " 
Down to a size 10 in pants . Just one more size to go before I'm down to my goal size !!! 
Easter egg hunt was awesome , worked a double , off to bed ... 
It's 10:48 P.M. and I can't sleep . I guess it's time to start reading my latest book \ABRAHAM LINCOLN : VAMPIRE HUNTER \"..." 
Have you ever had people friend request you and you except the request b/c you know them and they're cool but then you guys never talk ? I mean what is the point in that ? Isn't the whole point to reconnect or to stay connected ? So why in the hell do people friend request you knowing damn well they don't have shit to say to you ... 
Saw CLASH OF THE TITANS today and let me just say they really fucked that one up !!! I hope no one was a fan of the original ... 
So I used red box today for the first time . Can I just say it am excited !!! 
Ninja Assassin is one of the most violent movies I've seen in years ... ... I love it . 
It's hotter than the devil's < PROPMALE > out here !!! 
FRIDAY THE 13TH was fun and campy HALLOWEEN is the worst horror remake to date but NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET looks absolutely fantastic . Every time I see a preview of this movie I get goosebumps ... 
So I go to my Myspace < PROPFEMALE > and decided to delete all the mail and notifications and I see a link that offers you a Myspace e-mail account . Now , my question is does anybody still actually use myspace anymore ??? Do any of you guys still check your account ??? 
Yet another night that The Sandman denies me sleep a at reasonable hour .... ... BITCH !!! 
This is some BULLSHIT !!! It's 12 fucking 30 in the a.m. and I still can't get to sleep . This is some BITCHASSNESS !!! 
Had dinner with my Hardlines crew tonight . May I just say that I have THE BEST DEPARTMENT IN ALL OF SAM'S CLUB !!! 
It's too early ... Or late ... I'm not sure ... Sleep - the sickness and the cure .... 
So I'm on the busstop and this guy who is wearing the 3D glasses from the movies just walked over to me and stated the obvious ... * So you just chillin ' n da shade wit da wadder , huh ... * 
Fuck you Insomnia !!! I gotta secret weapon tonight ! And you can tell The Sandman to SUCK MY **** !!! 
The ghetto word of the day is \HOTEL\ " . I don't tell Bonquisha shit because that HOTEL errthing she hear .... "

Today's ghetto word is VEGAS . Dis bitch don't have the VEGAS idea what the fuck she doin ' . 
Hey everybody , the ghetto word of the day is DIMENSION . Yall know my babies farva be tall , dark , handsome and not DIMENSION smart ... 
The kids next door are banging on the walls and the parents are letting them . It reminds me of the kids that run around in < PROPFIRST>'s .... 
After the day I had at work today I need to get fucked up !!! SHOTS ! SHOTS ! SHOTS ! SHOTS ! SH-SHOTS !!! 
I had two nights of getting to bed at a decent time and now I'm feeling like The Sandman was just teasing me since he's a punk-ass bitch !!! I guess it's gonna be a SAW marathon for me .... 
Just imagine a criminal wearing baggy pants and saying something like fo ' shizzle . Now open your eyes , what do you see ? A black man ? Well , that was a white woman !!! Shame on you !!! * I love THE OFFICE !!! * 
Ghetto word of the day ... DEFENSE - I saw this dude running from the cops but he hopped DEFENSE and got away . 
1 and a 1/2 more days ' til my big day !!! I'm hoping hardcore that this guy is totally awesome and that this date isn't a complete fail !! 
So I can't sleep ... Should I read or watch a movie ??? And if I watch a movie should I go out to get movie snacks ??? Decisions , decisions ... 
So lately I've been having alot of conversations about people selling out . But I feel like some people are sellouts ( Plies , I'm looking at you with your Harvard education and your bad grammer ) , some people aren't & some people are just being haters . So , selling out , what is it and who doing it ??? How do you guys feel about ??? 
I always want what I can't have ... Like sleep ... 
YOU KNOW YOU’RE FROM BALTIMORE WHEN ... You've wondered where the freeway between < PROPMALE > and Mulberry Street was supposed to go to . 
I finally figured out how to delete \friends \"!!!" 
Ran , work , sleep ... 
So some people are working on the water pipes in my neighborhood & they shut off all the water . Well , that sucked b/c I had just come back from running and I had to go to work . So I had to go to the store while stinkin ' and buy two 1 gallon jugs of water so I could wash my ass in a pot !!! 
The midnight church service is on . It's time for me to begin making attempts to go to sleep .... 
So , today I will clean my house , go to the movies and buy a new dress ... Not necessarilly in that order ... 
Just saw A NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST . and I gotta say I loved it . Wierd b/c all the things I've people say bad about it , I loved . It was old school mixed with new school and actors too old to play teens . I say good times .... 
Reading UNDER THE DOME by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Let me just say I hope I'm never trapped somewhere w/ a bunch of people b/c the human race is fucking nuts !!! 
So I'm on Perez < PROPMALE > getting my fix of celebrity gossip and it turns out that one of < PROPMALE>' cause of death was chronic constipation .... 
You know you're ghetto if you have a tip on your toenails ... 
I just wanna say the movie title HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON sounds like it could be the title of a porn flick .... 
Saw IRON MAN 2 , it was boring ... 
To all my Mommies out there , HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY !!! 
So I had an interesting conversation w/ someone I see on a daily basis and it made me realize that some of the people I see on the regular are ignorant morons . They would rather believe non-sense versus just asking for truth & they'd talk behind your back than confront you to your face .... Pussies !!! 
Today I'm going to eat breakfast for breakfast , lunch & dinner .... 
Occasionally , I like to think I'm a nice person ... Then I stopped ignoring MF the next to asking me questions and I moved to another seat ... 
Question ... What is it with people taking pics in the mirror just to put on FACEBOOK ? Why not wait for a ginuine photo op and then post thos e pics on FB ??? 
Question ... What is it with people taking pics in the mirror just to put on FACEBOOK ? Why not wait for a genuine photo op and then post those pics on FB ??? 
Have you ever forgotten your schedule and showed up to work on a day off or at the wrong time ??? Well , I did and feel like a dumbass ... But at least I can go back to bed .

At the Taco < PROPFEMALE > and I'm pretty sure the people are getting road head . 
Went down to the HIPPO last night . It was pretty fun but I was dissappointed with the ladies fashion . I get that some ladies like to look like dudes but not a one of those ladies were GQ . They all looked like they bought thoer clothes off the clearance rack at Changes ....

So I'm watching ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A FIFTH GRADER and I must say this fifth grader isn't that smart b/c he's gotten every answer wrong ..... 
I've watching previews of ECLIPSE , why is it that everyones hair ( or weave ) looks a hot fuckin ' mess except < PROPFEMALE>'s ? 
LORD OF THE RINGS or SAW ??? I think i'll switch it up and watch BLADE ... 
Gonna go see THE KARATE KID , then hit up Fells Point for some shopping .... 
Have you ever read someone's FB status and got the urge to tell them to STFU ?!? 
Dammit , it took forever to find a decent stream of last night episode of TRUE BLOOD !!! 
I'm taking a power nap befor I take a power run ... 
I used to think FB was like MYSPACE's older , more mature , less slutty sister but somewhere along the line FB has gotten a big head and has become just as bad as MYSPACE . The only difference is 1 you can't \pimp\ " your profile and 2 a lot of the older generation finds it sociallly exceptable to have a FB profile ... " 
Damn you , < PROPFEMALE > Hopkins !!! 
So I just recently got a new phone and switched companies so why is my first mont < PROPMALE > $659.00 ??? What's worse is that I can't look at the < PROPMALE > online and I can't get in touch with a live person at Sprint ... 
@ the flea market with my mother and its hotter than the Devils < PROPMALE > in July out here !!! 
So I'm in < PROPMALE > Farms and I'm behind this lady who is buying two $1 bag of Doritos with food stamps . Now , I have been fortunate enough in my life to not have had to use use or need food stamps but I'm pretty damn sure that's not what the fuck EBT is supposed to be used for !!! 
@ Gay Pride and I am def entertained !!! 
Just got back from Gay Pride ... I had such a great time !!! 
So\ 
I get a recommendation for this one girl b/c we have friends in common . \ 
I go to her < PROPFEMALE > to see who she is & I look at her pics & let \ 
me just say to the ladies : It's not sexy/hot/cute to post pics of \ 
yourself in underwear . The only people who wanna see that shit is guys \ 
that are trying to get into your pants .... 
I watched THE BOONDOCKS today and I'm pretty sure this weeks episode took a direct stab at < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ... I loved it !!!! 
Just got done watching TRUE BLOOD and I just wanna say I want some of what < PROPFEMALE > got !!!! 
So I just saw ECLIPSE and I gotta say it was not the suckfest that I was expecting . For what it was it was actually pretty damn decent . Of course , if you're not a fan I don't recommend it but I theroughly enjoyed this flick and just so you know I inappropiately laughed at every girl who cried during this flick !!! 
Just saw THE LAST AIR BENDER now I'm gonna use this last little bit of daylight to get my run on ... 
Just got done watching THE CRAZIES . I would consider this a class 2 outbreak ( even though they weren't zombies ) . Biological warfare will be the end of us all . You say I'm watching movies , I say I'm doing research and when the shiz hits the fan I'll be ready .... 
Signed up for a couple of college courses for the fall . That's right Pwade is furthering her education !!! 
BEST !!! DATE !!! EVER !!! 
To all my fellow < PROPFIRST>'s Club associates !!! I'm on vacation , have fun busting your asses at work while I'm at home chillin ' . That is all !!! 
Again , I am on vacation this week and to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > I have not gotten a butt fungus from sitting on it !!! 
So I've heard those < PROPMALE > Gibson tapes and people are pissed that he use racial slurs but really ? The \N\ " word or calling his nanny a \ " Wet ****\" isn't even the worst of it !!! Never mind the fact that he is just verbally wearing her ass out or telling her \ " if she gets raped it's her fault\ " . I think two things about this situation ... " 
Sometimes life squeezes lemon juice in your eyes then laughs at you while you cry like a little bitch b/c you eyes are burning . Other times it hands you a nice glass of ice cold , sweet ass lemonade with a little umbrella in it ... Well , people I'm enjoying my glass of lemonade and I'm sippin ' it slow ... 
Has anyone noticed that all of the hair stores in Baltimore ( probably other cities , too ) are owned by asians with african employees ???

Let me know if you are in ...

Fact : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > can jump start a car by hooking jumper cables to his nipples ...

So I tossed and turned all night and inbtween the tossing and turning I had nightmares , inbetween the nightmares I woke up to make the nightmares weren't reality . Needless to say , this is going to be a long fucking day which may turn into a long fucking weekend !!!! 
Another crappy night where I have to make sure the dreams are not reality ... 
If there's nothing to fear but fear itself then why am I terrified ?!? 
Its cold out here !!! 
It's 2 hours into day 1 of working overnight this week and it sucks . Bad . 
OK , people , tonight is day 2 of me working overnight this week . I think I might try that 5 hour energy drink b/c there's no way I'm drinking coffee again . That shit fucked my stomach up !!! 
This is my last night on the overnight shift !!! Can I get a HALLELUJAH ?!? 
No more night shift for me and I'm glad b/c I miss my girls !!! So now I'm getting my relax on to prepare for work tomorrow morning but first I gotta mop the floors and move around some furniture first .... 
Ugg boots and Crocks are so FUCKING ugly !!! 
As much as I like working the early shift and getting off early , I'ma have to give a big middle finger at having to wake up at 4:40 a.m. 
Went to the dealership today . I ended up seeing another car I'm interested in more than the one I originally liked . So I'm going to wait another couple of weeks , stack up my paper and go for the Jeep !!! 
Shit is just getting weirder and weirder and I have no fucking clue what to do about it !!! 
It takes some silence to make sound . It takes a loss before you found it and it takes a road to go nowhere . It takes a toll to make you care . It takes a hole to make a mountain ... - < PROPFIRST > Mraz . If things were easy we'd all be doing it all the time . Sometimes it takes the rough patch to see it's worth it ... 
Today I feel worse than that time I fell down a flight of steps , got caught in a bear trap and accidentally set myself on fire ... 
No mani , no pedi , no fresh hair extensions ... I am dedicated to the cause . In 2 weeks I will have a car . In 2 weeks I will give the MTA 2 big middle fingers !!! 
Went to Weight Watchers today and discovered I lost more weight . :-) I started out at 177 now I'm down to 169.4 . I'll be fit & trim in no time ... 
I slacked on my running for damn near 2 weeks but today I feel good and I'm getting my Nike+ on then seeing what I can get into later on tonight !!! Oh and be sure to check my new shoes . They're killer !!!

Norris’s wife burned the turkey one Thanksgiving , < PROPMALE > said , “Don’t \ 
worry about it , Dear , ” and went into his backyard . He came back 5 \ 
mins later with a live turkey , ate it whole then threw it up a few \ 
seconds later fully cooked with cranberry sauce . When his wife asked him\ 
how he had done it , he gave her a swift roundhouse kick to the face and said , “Never question < PROPMALE > Norris . ”\ 
HAPPY THANKSGIVING !!! 
Things I'm thankful for : An awesome support system aka kickass friends & fam , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jokes , people wearing bad fashion & reality ( yes reality ) aka things for me to laugh at , books aka things to stimulate my mind , stupid people aka people who make me look smarter by association & last but not least the possible future zombie apocalypse aka something for me to look forward to ...

This line at Barnes & < PROPMALE > reminds of the lines at 6 Flags .

This class/course I wanna take at Phoenix is f*ckin ' $1220.00 . * Sigh * . Looks like I'm gonna have to live my life on cheap ( real cheap ) for the next two months . The price we pay to learn new skills and better ourselves ... \ 
... But it's not gonna stop me from playing the Mega Millions . I gotta exhaust all possibilities and winning the lottery is a viable option .

I now understand why people think I'm weird for talking about the zombie apocalypse . It's still a threat but I get the weird looks .... 
So I just watched < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera sing the National Anthem on Perez < PROPMALE > . She sounded great but she messed up the words . Oh well , at least she didn't pull a \Tyrese\ " and purposefully change the lyrics . < PROPFIRST > is still the greatest NA singer of all time !!! " 
Another one bites the dust ... :-( *Sigh * 
So I'm shopping through apps for my phone and I come across a < PROPFIRST>'s Club app . That's right if you have an android phone you can download the SC app . :-/
