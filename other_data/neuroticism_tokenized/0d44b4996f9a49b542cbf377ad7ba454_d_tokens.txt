< PROPFIRST>'s bed ATE Hello < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!! :( 
< PROPFIRST>'s bed gave Hello < PROPFEMALE > back

too much to do this week =( 
Just had a shaving cream fight at < PROPFEMALE>'s . Got interrogated by a cop because of it . =D 
5 years <3 . It's been a great anniversary/ < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday celebration . Could only be better if I wasn't sick ! 
has biology chocolate AND white chocolate =D 
will NEVER look at plants the same way again thanks to McKinnley . Nature is rated R !!!!! 
... People are really weird =D 
I CAN be bribed with < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
If you know a \ Mr. Fresh\ " stay away because he likes to hit cars and make the doors not open !!! " 
Another promise , another scene , Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed , And all the green belts wrapped around our minds , And endless red tape to keep the truth confined .. SO COME ON ! 
Hello , my name is < PROPFEMALE > Day and I am a procastinator ..... Professors need punched in the face for making us do work anyway !! 
I propose that we completely forget about finals and just go home for break early =D 
Only 4 more finals , 1 speech , and 1 7-page paper to go ! 
stupid power outage ! This week was supposed to be easy =( 
Only 3 more finals and 3 and a half pages on my paper to go !! =D 
Paper is done ! Yayyyyyyyy 
Only the two Dr. < PROPMALE > exams left , then I get to go home and face a potential snow storm . Exciting =D 
Everyone have a Happy New Year ! 
HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!!!! 
Dear \Genius\ " playlist - you placed Killers into a Brit-pop/rock category .... They . are . from . < PROPFEMALE >......" 
It's only the first day of classes and I'm ready to quit 
It's past time for bed . I HATE 8 A.M. classes , but I'm loving this cute little evil dog thingy that my suite-mate gave to me =) 
Only Biology lecture and lab and then I can come home . Can't wait to sleep in tomorrow morning =D 
Feels very excited that her 8:30 class is cancelled ! =D 
So my Blackboard account is dead .... and I am supposed to sign on it tonight for my online class ..... and my password was supposed to be sent to my email but it wasn't ... and no one will answer my emails or my phone calls .... Isn't college great ?? 
Only two more hours of being a teenager =( . This year , my birthday is not a day to celebrate - it is a day to mourn 
Hungryyyyyyyyy 
I am faced with a < PROPMALE > problem . I must choose between an awesome , colorful , fingerpainted background surrounding hello < PROPFEMALE > ... OR the same awesome background with the words \OH MY\ " written on it ...... " 
Such a dreary day . Guess I'll curl up with a book 
Here's my suggestions to improve campus life at Concord . 1 . a globe that would enclose campus to keep out all of the stupid snow & rain . It would be like a non-snow globe . 2 . A big conveyor belt system to take students to & from class . 3 . Room service in all the dorms . 4 . An anti-theft face-punch mechanism . If you try to steal , you'll get punched . 5 . Free 50 inch flat screen TVs for everyone who has had a TV stolen . 
< PROPMALE > is FORCING me to eat < PROPMALE>'s . He's so MEAN 
Should totally be studying for my Geog class .... but Facebook counts as studying , right ? 
I'm going to be like Poe and study ! =) 
Feeding < PROPFEMALE > =) 
Packing my bags . I have just received news that I am to drop out of college , and move into the hello < PROPFEMALE > house and have someone feed me cherries =) If it's what Dr. < PROPMALE > thinks is best 
Operation Poe will begin =) 
Poe ? What about Poe ? I have no idea what you're talking about !!!! 
So < PROPFEMALE > is in our room dancing with a painted face .... =) 
is bored 
NO CLASSES TOMORROW !!!! Life is sooo gooooood 
So I'm listening to < PROPFIRST>'s zune ... a playlist entitled Night . Most depressing music in the world to go to sleep to . 
Things that are wrong : A . It is cold , FREEZING actually . B . There is like 200.5298 feet of snow outside . C . It's almost 8 AM and I am still awake . D . I'm pretty sure my stomach is eating itself . E . I'm terribly bored 
I should be exhausted , but I'm quite energized . I really need sleep ....... 
After last week , I don't think I can survive a full week of school =( 
Time to either sleep or read , until History class . I hope it gets cancelled . That would equal a perfect day . 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE>'s door now has a hello < PROPFEMALE > door hanger on it =) 
Oooh-oh-oh Can't tell me nothing now , Baby I know how to fly . Oooh-oh-oh Can't nothing hold me down , I'm gonna touch the sky . =) 
Classes are over for me , so it's time to get back into my PJs 
Reading time , yay !!!! 
Bored out of my mind ...... 
Walmart trip , I vote < PROPMALE > to drive =) 
Inclement weather = Love <3 
* sighs * no one loves me , so I guess I'm gonna read 
Bed <3 
Only 1 more class to go . I love inclement weather and class cancellations =) 
Concord night classes cancelled ... when do night classes begin ? 4 ? 5 ? 
< PROPFIRST > needs beauty sleep , so he will be sleeping for the next 40 years or so . 
I've changed my mind . I love snow . woot 
I care for all of you !!! Let's see who in my Friend's List actually pays attention . Copy and repost this in your own bulletin . Let's see who the true friends are !!! 
< PROPMALE > IS ATTACKING < PROPFIRST > ! He is no longer my friend !!! < PROPFIRST > will probably not be able to make babies now ..... 
I'm falling in love with Coldplay .... 
Time to curl up and read . Gonna stay up as long as I can to try and finish this book 
EVERYONE ! Start texting < PROPFEMALE > Rinehart like mad !! 
Watching < PROPFIRST > get his hair straightened =) 
Why must I punish myself by staying up late , knowing I have a dumb 8AM class ? Goodnight , world . 
OMGEEEEEE !!! Rock on the Range , anyone ? Skillet ! Papa Roach ! Rise Against !! Coheed !!! Three Days Grace !!!! APOCALYPTICA !!!!!!!!!!!!! Who cares if it's $120 per ticket ? I'M GOING 
I'm thinking that < PROPMALE > and cheese will be perfect right now =) 
wants to sleep and forget about the rest of this week 
is glad to be back on campus =) 
So , Concord doesn't cancel day classes , when there was actually some snow on the roads . NOW THEY CANCELLED EVENING CLASSES ???? The roads are clear , sir . 
Matt = evil 
.... < PROPFIRST > HATES MEH =( 
I'm defrosting my orange juice =) 
Apparently Facebook is getting back at me and Poe for our many many posts =( 
thinks its time for bed ... or at least time to read 
So I've ran around the past two weeks , especially this week , gathering everything I need for my portfolio . Although I already had all the requirements , I used yesterday to rewrite and tweak every little detail . Now campus is closed : I won't get to turn in my portfolio today . Not seem like a big deal ? Today was the last day . This epic fail truly makes me hate snow . It's ruining my college career ! 
OH ! And massive snowstorm also equals me most likely being stuck up here this weekend . What happened to that protective bubble I asked for ? 
=) Portfolios will be accepted on Monday . Yay ! 
We just bought our tickets to ROTR ! =) 
I NEED BOOKS ! Anyone have any suggestions ? 
Don't let < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner near anything that he can use as blackmail ! 
Snow equals perfect way to scare Poe when she wakes up . 
What do you MEAN I have a paper due tomorrow ?? 
I've decided that my essay for history is going to have magical powers and write itself =) 
I don't even have any friends . GRR to you all !!!! <3 < PROPFEMALE > 
Dear history paper , I want you to know that even though you do not exist yet , I completely hate you . Signed with loathing resentment , < PROPFEMALE > 
Facebook is not a reliable source to use in a paper , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner !!!!!!!!!! 
stupid paper ..... grrrr 
I is excited =) After today , the rest of my week will be completely effortless . And THEN i get to go home for an awesome week . And tomorrow is the birthday of the GREATEST PERSON EVER ! And I get to dye my hair over break ! All of these things make me entirely happy , regardless of my lack of sleep and incomplete history paper <3 
thinks < PROPFEMALE > Targosky is fabulous . 
would like to amend that she thinks that BOTH < PROPFEMALE > Targosky and < PROPFEMALE > Poe are awesome . 
My facebook has been hacked by < PROPFEMALE > Targosky =) 
EVERYONE ! < PROPFEMALE > is NOT crazy and I adore her =) 
=) Just woke up . Yay ! 
< PROPMALE > is very bad at giving clues .... 
please please please make them stop ! I AM NOT deciding . I always have to decide . GRRRR 
So , my favorite lyrics at the moment ? So up they picked me by the big toe . I was held from the rooftop , then they let it go . There's any screaming , let the windows down as I come to the ground . <3 
Dear World , You're tricking us aren't you ? Giving us small hopes that spring is here - the song of birds chirping , the dazzling bright sun , the promise of warm weather this week ... Ah , but you have plans to crush our hearts and dump 20 more inches of snow on us soon , right ? Okay , I'm on to you . Cruel , evil little world . <3 < PROPFEMALE > 
I is loving spring break =) Relaxing , enjoying the warm weather , enjoying my new hair , enjoying the idea of an industrial .... Yep , life is pretty much good 
Sad movies ARE NOT cool =( 
My break is almost over =( I DON'T WANNA GO BACK 
Back at college .... grr face 
Just ordered 50 belly button rings ... So I'm feeling pretty special . 
Dumb uncomfortable bed - kept me tossing and turning all night long . Dumb 8 a.m. math class - he taught us that if both sides are the same number , then they must be equal .... SUCH a hard concept to grasp . Can't wait for the day to be over so I can crash 
Putting homework aside until tomorrow , and gonna read <3 
okay , so NOW I'm really getting off of here =) 
.... I should take a nap .... 
Getting worri < PROPMALE > .... still have not receiv < PROPMALE > a call to set up my interview with the < PROPMALE > . dept .... Guess they hate me =O 
Dumb online class . I hate busy work 
Dumb Pieces of Flair ... won't let me send evil buttons to my evil friends 
I just made it rain Mountain Dew =) =) 
Just woke up . I advise EVERYONE to take a class taught by a coach . They are never there =) 
Just finished reading Ender's Game . One of the best books that I've read .... <3 
Beautiful day ! Definitely time for a trip to Pipestem !! =) 
My head hurts because < PROPFIRST > dropped me and my head hit a metal pole . He's abusive and he doesn't even try =P 
is sick =( 
finds it alarming that her mouthwash was placed in the trash . Does not like this . 
Is glad that < PROPFEMALE > Targosky is enjoying her grilled cheese . And in return , I have an awesome tattoo =) 
so APPARENTLY someone does not want me to have clean teeth because my toothpaste magically disappeared as well . Please . It's not nice to throw away someone else's half full Listerine AND to take away their good toothpaste as well . 
hmmm ... nap ? I think so 
A sidewalk covered in worms = Yuck . 
Back from Pipestem . Had fun . Was cold though .... =) 
SOMEONE shouldn't give landline texts that wake sleeping people up . So , now I'm angry . Grrrrrr . =D 
< PROPMALE > is mean . Someone should walk down to the office and punch him . Thank you . 
The McDonald's here is dumb . Why does everything seem to be better as long as it's not in Princeton ? 
So , my razor ? Switched out with the other girl's who has a < PROPFEMALE > ? We have different colors . Mine is purple . Theirs - green . I even keep mine out of the shower away from theirs . How is it that they got switched out ? I would have had a serious brain malfunction for ME to have done it . Sure , I thought I had a concussion last week , but I honestly don't see how it was done any other way than on purpose . 
Been a long , yet wonderful day . Time for bed <3 
So , I look outside and I see snow . Not fair ! =( 
< PROPFIRST > Bellew is awesome and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner is not . That simple 
Time to waste about 7 hours , doing absolutely nothing . I LOVE my Tuesdays and Thursdays =) 
Ready for the day to be over 
Time to read ; no classes tomorrow , but need my rest so that me and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner can OWN < PROPFIRST > Bellew at tennis =) 
So , got my piercings today =) The needle didn't hurt anymore than getting a piercing with a gun , just like the piercer said . And I'm already in love with my industrial <3 
I have confidence that I am going to FAIL my bio test tomorrow =( 
30 < PROPFEMALE > to relax before < PROPFIRST > gets out of class . Gonna lay down - hope my ear doesn't bleed anymore =) 
Pretty happy with the Rock On The Range lineup . Could be a little better , but it appears that we'll get to see most of the bands we want without too much overlapping =) 
So I got a B on my Bio 102 exam ... I think that pretty much makes me a rebel =) 
Couldn't get into one of her classes . Grrrrrr 
Loves her boyfriend for skipping calc for her <3 
So I had to cave in and add an 8AM class . Grr face 
It's too hot , I'm grouchy and sick , and I have a paper to write for a crazy professor . Can life get any better ? 
Meat continues to gross me out . I don't even know why I should eat it . I should become a vegetarian . 
Time for bed ? I believe so =) 
Disappointed , angry , depressed equals me right now . Oh well - if they weren't from Canada , they would have won =) 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE !!! 
Are there any < PROPFIRST > Bellew's out there that are utterly confused ? Maybe < PROPFIRST > Bellew ? Or < PROPFIRST > Bellew ? Or perhaps < PROPFIRST > Bellew ? But which is the REAL one ? 
Then there's < PROPFIRST > Bellew 
Hello . < PROPFIRST > Bellew's name is < PROPFIRST > Bellew . And my name is < PROPFIRST > Bellew . =D 
Now that we're all back to our true names , all of the < PROPFIRST > Bellew comments are quite interesting =) 
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor <3 
=( I don't know where my < PROPFIRST > is .... 
So I look at < PROPFIRST > and pout , and I instantly get what I want . I adore being spoiled <3 
I DO NOT like fire alarms that go off before MY alarm =( Even if it was just a few minutes . 
So apparently my day is going to consist of sitting in my dorm by myself on this pretty day . Wonderful . Thanks < PROPFIRST > . 
I am so thankful that I have a GOOD family that actually cares about me , supports me , and loves me . Some people aren't so lucky . 
Not trying to be dramatic or anything , but I think I'm dying . 
I think my math teacher wants us to learn how to count cards .... so anyone up for Vegas ?? =) 
Only 3 more weeks left . And finals week doesn't even really count because it's gonna be the best week ever . =) 
And to be honest , I haven't started my essay yet , and I plan to continue my procrastination for at least another hour and 30 minutes . 
There are a lot of dumb games on here .... 
Eating a frozen uncrustable =) 
So I think I'm going to actually start my paper now , although I'd much rather have my face punched repeatedly by a flock of angry penguins . 
Sleepy , my head hurts , and I just want this paper to be finished =( 
YAY , BED <3 
And my miserable day begins . Luckily , the rest of my week is looking beautiful after today . =) 
Today seems like a definite skip-class day . =) 
My head hurts and I don't wanna go to lab =( . Two more weeks to go , but I'm done NOW ! 
Debating on what earring I should order ..... ah , why not order them ALLLL ?! =) 
\THIS is a MOOSE . \ " =D " 
Have you met my boyfriend ? His name is Mr. Lame .... He's lame =) 
< PROPFIRST > Bellew and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner are at war in their dorm . I'm scared for my life and feel that I need to take cover .... 
=) Only a week and a half left ! =) 
Just got back from my last science lecture EVER . 
I GOTS ACCEPTED INTO THE TEACHING PROGRAM =) =) 
Which do you prefer ? \The fascination of what's difficult has dried the sap of my veins and rent spontaneous joy and natural content out of my heart . \ " OR \ " It eats my soul . \"" 
Had fun getting in freezing water and taunting < PROPFIRST > Bellew with help from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner =) < PROPFIRST > is a chicken =P 
Study for my exam or go to Sonic with awesome ppl ? I chose the food =) 
I ... just hatched ... an uncrustable =) 
Day of Procrastination #2 : Write history paper or go to Outback with awesome ppl . Once again , I chose the food .... and I still haven't started that paper . 
Time to finish that paper that's due today =) 
History paper is finished . The rest of my week = pure awesomeness <3 
I think I'm in love with this week =) 
hates fire alarms that stop as soon as you step outside ! =( 
Last night here ! Yay ! =) 
So my computer just went psycho on me . Hope it's not where I was playing those converted songs .... maybe they will make my stereo blow up 
So , in a few hours I'll be home for the summer . Kinda terrific , kinda sad . =( 
So far , I have all A's . I must say , I approve of this =) 
< PROPMALE > in a few days . =) Without this trip , I'd probably lose the little bit of sanity I have left . 
my family is a little psychotic . =) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > thinks you're ugly 
Less than 24 hours <3 =) =) So excited . 
Getting ready , last minute packing . And then I'm off to have an awesome weekend with < PROPFIRST > Bellew and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner and being surrounded by awesome bands . =) 
So my part of the road trip is over . Tomorrow I get to sit back and relax while < PROPMALE > drives us to < PROPMALE > . Unless he gets us killed .... =) 
time for bed . Can't wait - just hours away from 2 full days of awesomeness =) 
We at the hotel , motel , Holiday Inn !... Well , it's actually a Red Roof Inn =) 
Rock On The Range was completely awesome today ! It was worth it just to see Rise Against , Skillet , and Three Days Grace . And tomorrow we get to see Apocalyptica and Coheed ! So excited =) 
OMG , Apocalpytica was amazing !!! So fantastic , so beautiful , so my favorite performance of all =) 
One of the best weekends ever !! =) 
haha , silly low quality videos . Makes it sound like NO ONE at the concert could sing =) 
Hungry =( 
Guys are ..... dumb =( 
Every time I listen to music , I act like I'm still at a concert ..... 
Last to Know by Three Days Grace is absolutely beautiful . It gives me goosebumps <3 
So where can you go and catch up with old friends , laugh at people , touch a mohawk , and witness a marriage proposal all at once ? FHS Graduation of course =) 
My clothes keep multiplying like bunnies . It's out of control , I promise . 
wants McDonald's fries .... =( 
Had fun hiking today .... except for those creepers .... 
My cereal ate my spoon =( 
I'm eating my boyfriend's penguin =D 
Baby loves to dance in the dark , cause when he's looking she falls apart <3 
MIZUHARA !!! That's RAWR in Japanese =) 
Nothing better than driving home at night during a thunderstorm . I LOVE the lightning =) 
Time to go have fun with my family for my mommy's birthday !! =D 
So today was fun day ..... besides the fact that I ripped one of my favorite pair of shorts and made my toe bleed =D 
Yum yum , breakfast time !!!! =D 
So I was going through some old notes from middle and high school . Best part so far ? : \I told he she better requanize who she talking to a ruffrider . \ " ..... yep ! =D " 
And last night was an epic , wonderful , becoming night . Why , you may ask ? ONLY with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > could I stare at the stars in a graveyard , remember our ridiculous yet clever past , sing a song about our hillbilly heritage , and write a story consisting of Howie Mandel and < PROPMALE > Sanchez . <3 =D 
misses < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s mp3 player because it has the best music eveh on it . And now I'm on youtube looking up the songs I can remember =D 
Stupid Concord . I don't WANT to take out a < PROPFEMALE > , but I guess I'll have to since you lowered my Pell =( 
Dear rain , I am beginning to despise you . 
Had an AMAZING time with < PROPFEMALE > Dailey and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > hiking along the beautiful river , marveling over trees , rock formations , bras hanging from limbs , a waterfall , hobbit holes , and our secret little sandbar . Too bad that Mamaw thought we had died or something .... 
TONS of lovely music thanks to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . I'm overwhelmed with musical happiness right now =D 
So my redneck brother who spends all his time huntin ' and fishin ' didn't want me to change Telephone by Lady Gaga ... =D 
I wish I had big man arms so I could rearrange my room .... 
According to Expedia , it would only cost 1000 dollars more to fly to Italy and Germany than it would to go visit Beckley .... 
So I'm going to another concert in a month . How do I feel about this ? Pretty sweet . =) 
Time for some good food , awesome people , and possibly going to the park later on for the fireworks . =) 
Having an argument with < PROPMALE > Cook about vampires ... very interesting . 
So we're having a yard sale this Fri and Sat , 9am to 3pm , Cunard Rd . Women's , juniors , and men's clothing , computer desk , dresser w/ mirror , 2 compound bows , stereo system , video games for playstation 2 , nitendo gamecube , xbox360 , and some for the old sega and nitendo systems ( I believe they are for the sega < PROPFEMALE > and super nitendo ) . And a lot of other stuff =) 
Just a reminder : We are having a yard sale today until 3pm and tomorrow 9am - 3pm . We have lots of stuff and we HAVE to get rid of it , so drop on by =) 
Please pray for my mom - they found several knots in her breasts . Also , please keep < PROPFEMALE > in your prayers as well . 
I am a big loseh 
Just got back from watching Eclipse with my mommy <3 
Time to go with < PROPFIRST > so he can pay off his car =) 
Doesn't want summer to end ...... 
Nudiustertian , I was walking down the vomitory when my foot began to yeuk . So I took off my winklepickers and held them under my oxters so I could releive the yeuk . I didn't realize that I dropped my spondulicks and now I have tittynope left ! 
My mom went for another test today . They are still concerned and want her to get a biopsy . Please pray that it comes back negative . 
Dear Concord , please stop sending me \revised\ " award letters that are exactly the same as all the others I've already mailed back to you . " 
Dear NCIS , \ 
You've got West < PROPFEMALE > all wrong . Yes , we're country folk , but we still don't dress or talk that way . GAYSE station ? Come on . Next time you should depict West < PROPFEMALE > ns with a little bit of the CORRECT accent , a little bit of a temper , a little bit of huntin ' and fishin ' , but a lot more respect . 
Watched Inception today . It was INCREDIBLE . =) 
So this two cans and string site is pretty awesome ..... =) 
THUNDERSTORM !! <3 
This is so gorginshcnipe . So roofin ' sweet !!!! 
seriously . twocansandstring is so much more entertaining than facebook =D 
So I may be going to < PROPFEMALE > to see a concert this weekend ! I don't even really know the girl that well , but does that matter ?? NO ! Why ?? Because she's still awesome with an adorable voice and I'll be with my < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Dailey !!! <3 
GRRR . So I wanted a job ALL summer and never got any call backs . Until now . 3 weeks before school starts . 
Had the MOST AMAZING time with a certain < PROPFIRST > Bellew today hiking , picnicking , and a little rock climbing at Long Point . And I found out that IF I was a car in Nascar , my scoliosis would be considered a good thing !! =D 
OH my goodness ! Time to get ready and pack for the concert tonight !! =D 
Had a TERRIFIC time at the Lights concert AND in DC with < PROPFEMALE > Dailey and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
So I have like a week before I have to go back to the dorms . How does this make me feel ? At this point , I have NO IDEA ! 
So now that my brother has a Facebook , he stays logged in and I'm always ending up on his account . NOT happy about this . 
I feel that I need to let < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Dailey know that one of them was responsible for bruising my poor foot due to their crazy behavior . 
Food , food , food ! Please ???? 
I DO NOT like Walmart ! At least , not today . 
I can try to be your rock , but every now and then , I need someone to be mine . 
fighting with people on an anonymous website is very rewarding . =) 
Fayetteville tonight . Athens tomorrow , then back to Fayetteville tomorrow night . 
About to head up to Athens with < PROPFIRST > Bellew . I get to see my awesome < PROPFEMALE > Poe , the insane < PROPFEMALE > Targosky , and the ... strange < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner . =D 
Back home in Fayetteville , and I'm VERY HAPPY about this . Ten minutes in the dorms at Concord and you'll sweat off fifteen pounds . Oh , and of course I'm happy to have a couple more priceless days with my family ! <3 
Does anyone else find it ironic that when your driving BEHIND a rafting bus , the driver decides to be extra cautious and drive about 10mph , but when you're PASSING one , you're basically forced off the road by a psychotic driver ? 
To take the hot glue gun to my dorm or not . That IS the question ..... 
Back at college , and sure , there may be some cool people up here and all . But I left \ 
FAR MORE AWESOME people behind like my mommy , mamaw , and < PROPFEMALE > Dailey and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - I miss them already ! <3 
Not feeling very good . And I SHOULD be watching reruns of Cops with my mamaw right now =) 
There's a big spider hanging from my bathroom ceiling . Did I mention that I find spiders to be quite disturbing ??? 
In memory of every cancer patient , familymember and friend who has lost their battle with cancer and for thosewho continue to conquer it . Put this up for 1 hour if you know someonewho has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste . I did , will you ? Loveto those who are in the fight . Lots of love to those who lost ... the .. fight , but live on in our heart 
Finally done for the day . Pizza time ?? I believe so ! 
Bed , take two =) 
Trying to figure out a way to juggle 21 hours of classes , approximately 70 required field placement hours , as well as work study . Ugh , my social life this semester will be nonexistent . 
Dumb internet ! WORK !!! 
I think I'll be eating off of this burger for the rest of the week .... 
So my dog , my fluffy Pomeranian puppy , my baby puppy has short hair thanks to a certain Jaron < PROPFIRST > . Will I ever be able to look at him without bursting into laughter ?? 
Falling in love with Avenged Sevenfold all over again ... <3 
Forcing a certain < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner to eat one of my lunchables . =D 
Please pray for my little cousin , < PROPFIRST > Bickford - all things are possible with God ! =) 
Only 4 more hours and then I'll be done for the day . =) 
Ready for complaints ? Complaint #1 : Dear guy who wouldn't pass my car for inspection . Seriously ?!? You failed me because of my itty bitty back windows supposedly being too tinted ??? They aren't - the only way you couldn't see into my car would be if I was stashing a MIDGET back there . The ONLY possible convict that I let in my car would be < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner . 
Okay , now Complaint #2 : Dear crazy woman who was driving in front of me . Don't drive again . You are possibly the WORST driver that I've ever had the misfortune of following . When they say to brake in the curves , they don't mean to STOP . And next time you pull over to let me pass you , try not be still halfway in the road and slam the break . I felt like ramming into you honestly . 
Complaint #3 : My dog is STILL funny looking and probably will be for a couple of months . Thanks , Jaron < PROPFIRST > - it's like a < PROPFIRST > of sunshine to come home on the weekends and see my creepy dog's face . 
I'm feelin like a < PROPFEMALE > - you can't stop my shine ! =) 
And what's better than singing and dancing when no one else is around ?? NOTHING ! =D 
So not only is today the birthday of the great < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner - in one month from today , I will have been with the wonderful , terrific , amazing < PROPFIRST > Bellew for 6 years . <3 
I am seriously thinking of dropping a class . If I don't , I think my head will explode . So much for me being an over-achiever ... 
My car is legal again ! =) 
is so tired .... =( 
The elevator smells a little like Creepy Crawlers ..... 
Dear M . Shadows , \ 
Marry me ? Thank you . 
Ate too many lifesavers .... =( 
Awww . Miss Poe looks so cute when she's sleeping and not being a ninja . =) 
Got me like Oh my gosh , I'm so in love , I found you finally , you make me wanna say OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH MY GOSH =) 
Rain ! <3 
So . Sleepy . =( 
On an epic search for my glasses ... once again . =/ 
Dear < PROPFIRST > Bellew , You better be glad I love you or I'd be very angry with you for , oh I don't know , BREAKING MY GLASSES !!! 
Lunchable time ?? I believe so =) 
hungry >_< 
Time to head to my last class of the day . Can't wait for it to be over . 
Listening to people studying for plants ....... 
I WANT TOYS !!!! =) 
I'm such a kid ! =D 
So it's not even 9 PM yet and I'm already halfway done with my essay - this could be a first =) 
... the week of horror has begun >_< hahaha 
Dancing to music while going over my paper . Usually , I'd be rushing to finish my paper right now - I could definitely get used to this , but I'll probably convert back to procrastination .... 
Seriously - next time there's a fire alarm when I'm in the shower , I'll take my chances of being eaten by flames >_< 
Finally put my tattoo idea to paper - Now I just need someone with actual artistic talent to clean it up a bit ( or a lot ) =) 
With my baby =) 
Is sad because < PROPFIRST > is calling me a mutated , malformed individual =( 
Sick =( 
* sighs * 
Well , I have at least ONE of my placements now . Hopefully the rest will be at the same school . Now the question is : can I complete 65 hours ?? 
< PROPFEMALE > Poe is the BEST ROOMIE EVER because she gives me awesome Hello < PROPFEMALE > fortune telling ball ! 
Should be cleaning right now . But I'm ... not . 
Everybody ! Meet < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - she thinks you smell nice , but she's not ready to give a speech ... 
Eating muh leftovers from < PROPFIRST>'s . < PROPFIRST > Bellew is awesome =) 
Seriously thinking about dropping another class . Stupid field placements ... >_< 
So here's my dilemma . I have 50+ pairs of shoes . All under my bed . And when I have my heart set on wearing a certain pair , I can NEVER find them ! =( 
TRUE STORY ! < PROPFIRST > Bellew : * grabs < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner's ear and goes \nimma nimma nimma\ " in a cute little voice . And < PROPMALE > ... launches a starburst out of his MOUTH ..... strange boys . " 
Lunchable and apple juicebox = <3 
Can't wait for the day to be over . A little sad that I don't get to ruin < PROPFEMALE > Rinehart's birthday , but life must go on . >_< 
Loves < PROPFIRST > Bellew because he gives the best late anniversary gifts ever !! <3 
This makes me happy : This warranty is invalid and does not cover cosmetic damage or damage due to the acts of God .... =D 
My throat hurts . I hate cold weather that makes me sick . =( 
sick =( 
Adores her kindergartners ! <3 
So I have to teach two < PROPMALE > lessons in two different classes , both worth a huge percent of my final grade the same week . Gah - no pressure , right ? 
I really wish my voice would come back . =( 
has a demon skull !!! =D 
Ugh , SHOULD be working on my lesson plan and studying for a quiz , but of course Facebook wins . 
needs something exciting to do . So sick of homework and studying =( 
Hmm ... maybe I should just stay at college for the rest of my life ? 
Yeah , so anyone remember the Halloween parties I used to have ? Well , this year I'm venturing to a little haunted place down on the river known as Red Ash . So if you wanna come and you aren't scared of an island full of graves , let me know . =) 
Had a terrific time with my bestest friends < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Bellew , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner at Bridge Day today . Only < PROPFEMALE > NightFaire's lack of being there made me sad . <3 
I think if I don't stop coughing soon , I'm gonna cough my lungs up . =( 
NEEDS to be a good girl and start her homework . But will I ? Probably not . 
Time to make a lot of things right . 
It's been a long day . Time for bed . 
>_< 
One thing I've learned so far by making this floor plan - an ideal kindergarten classroom should be approximately 5000 square feet . Hmmm ... 
very happy that she chose to skip her history class to catch up on some sleep . =) 
hears a < PROPFEMALE > Targosky singing in the hall . =D 
<3 Lions make you brave , Giants give you faith , Death is a charade ... <3 
is becoming soooo attached to her kindergarten class . Can I please just bring them home with me ??? 
desperately needs supplies to make a witch =) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is the coolest person you'll ever meet . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ALSO loves < PROPFIRST > Bieber ! =D 
is stressed to the breaking point and most people don't seem to care ... 
Yeah- I'm just gonna finish my paper tomorrow .... =D 
Time to collapse , I think .... 
Can totally write her paper that's due tomorrow ... tomorrow =D Bedtime . 
Definitely nap time =) 
Terrified tons of children today - I feel accomplished . =D 
cannot do all of this . Preparing for three epic fails this week . =( 
is terrified about giving her 35 minute lesson today . =( 
is SOOO HAPPY to actually be doing NOTHING for once =D 
Math class cancelled once again .... =D 
Gangsta training begins early . A little boy in my kindergarten class already has the baggy pants and pointless belt thing going on . =D His pants were halfway down revealing his spiderman underwear for most of the day . 
Every ... body ... pay .... attention .... This ... right here .... is my .... prettyboyswag ! =D 
Maybe if people wouldn't worry about everyone else's lives , they'd be able to figure out their own . 
sick of professors giving me busy work ! 
Has < PROPFEMALE > MUCH energy and I want to dance , but < PROPFIRST > is too lame to dance with me . =( 
is in a WONDERFUL mood because she has no more classes today AND she got a 96% on her big Educ 306 lesson !! =D 
IS SO HAPPY , IS SO EXCITED , IS SO TERRIFICALLY , WONDERFULLY DETERMINED that she will be receiving the BEST birthday present ever !!! What could POSSIBLY be better than watching M . Shadows performing on stage ??? Nothing !!!! =D 
< PROPFIRST > Bellew is a really creepy boyfriend . AND < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner is a really creepy friend . 
thinks < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner is EVIL for soaking her with FREEZING water . And < PROPFIRST > Bellew is even more evil for sitting back and watching . >.< 
Was totally hit on by a 2nd grader ..... 
KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AREN'T SICK , GROSS OR STUPID , AND THEIR HANDICAP ISN'T CONTAGIOUS . THEY WANT WHAT WE ALL WANT : TO BE ACCEPTED AND LOVED . CAN I MAKE A REQUEST ? IS ANYONE WILLING TO POST THIS AND LEAVE IT UP AS YOUR STATUS FOR 1 HOUR ? IT'S SPECIAL EDUCATION WEEK AND THIS IS IN HONOR OF ALL CHILDREN WHO WERE MADE UNIQUE 
My tummy is growling - I need food ! 
rawrawrawrawrawr !!! I should be asleep ! =D 
FINALLY done with classes and observations . Now I'm just waiting for < PROPFIRST > and I GETS TO GO HOME for a week . =D 
HOME ! For a week ! =D 
Gah - my break's just begun and I'm already bored . 
Riding on the back of the fourwheeler while Jaron < PROPFIRST > hits jumps = BIGGEST adrenaline rush that I've had in a long time ! =D 
LOVES being home with her family . Where else can I have a toothpaste/water fight , explore old graveyards , go jumping on the fourwheeler with a half-insane brother , sing oldies around the dinner table , and use shining christmas lights as a jump rope ?? =D 
<3 And we have gone through good and bad times . But your unconditional love was always on my mind . You've been there from the start for me . And your love's always been true as can be . I give my heart to you , I give my heart because nothing can compare in this world to you .... <3 
has so much to be thankful for and is excited to spend Thanksgiving with those that she loves ! 
Walmart right now equals pure insanity . I LOVE IT !! 
Today was fun . Only one more day and then it's back to college , which I am dreading . 
Just put makeup on Jaron < PROPFIRST > - And I have to say that he makes a beautiful woman . =D 
wants Christmas break NOW !! 
playing with her gak that she kept from her early < PROPMALE > class . Such a kid =) 
Just ordered my iPod ! =) 
Broke my phone . This has just been a SPLENDID week ( note the sarcasm ) 
Awake . And I have NO reason to be . =( 
Dear local state road workers , Remember that huge sunken in hole on gatewood road that you have refused to fix for months ? And remember how your solution was to have traffic stop and take turns . Well , guess what ? It's on a hill . And it's now winter . Do you know what happens when little cars like mine stop on a hill covered in snow and ice ???? 
Whoever's stilling my internet and slowing it down ... I wanna punch them in the face >.< 
How am I supposed to come up with a science lesson about mummies that wouldn't terrify 5 year olds ?? 
I wish I wasn't so rushed today =( 
I HATE FedEx . Incorrect Address ?? I think I know my address - I've LIVED there my entire life . 
Will take part in the cartoon thing just for today because I'll honestly be glad to see faces again after this whole thing is over . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my baby brother , Jaron < PROPFIRST > ! 
Okay , I give in . Message me a number , and I'll do the status thing . But I'm only doing 5 tops . 
#4 : One of the most sarcastic people I know . And that's one of the most awesome things about you . You're hilarious and always make me laugh . And it's fun to debate with you over pointless twilight things . =P You're actually one of the people I miss most from our high school . You're a good guy and a great friend and there aren't many of those out there anymore . 
#972 : I don't really know you , but you're friends with my awesome roomie so you must be awesome too . And your baby is adorable . ( I'm assuming that that is your baby in your profile pic ) =) 
#6 : Goodness , we go way back , don't we ? Not always pleasant memories - often of us fighting or not being friends , but we've always pulled through and that's what counts . And one thing has NEVER changed . You have always been there for me when I needed you . When I felt like no one else cared , you did . You always know when to ask if I'm okay and you're ALWAYS there to listen to me . 
17 : What can I say about you ? I honestly don't know what I'd do without you . You're more than my other half . You're truly my everything . You've made me a better person and you're continuing to do that . You are the most amazing guy that I know and I don't know what I ever did to deserve you . But I'm glad you're with me . Because I love you with all of my heart and that will never change . <3 
612 : I don't think that there is anyone else on this campus that can make me laugh quite as much as you do . You're insane and crazy and that's why I love you . Although I must admit the first time you came into my room doing my dance scared me a little ... And you always have the answer to any problem : You has tattoos or it'll grow back . =) 
22 : The most amazing smelling person ever . Likes shiny . Me and < PROPFIRST > thought you were a bit of a freak when we first met you . And we were 100% correct =P But seriously you're one of the most awesome people that I have met and you're one of my closest friends , kid . 
968 : Oh how I love you , miss most wonderful roommate ever ! You're just pure awesomeness . Your giggle , your awesome story telling skills , your bubbly personality , your semi-gothic attire , your disney music , your mad ninja sleeping skills ... I could just go on and on . I love you =) 
I think it's time to whip out that emergency can of Mountain Dew . =) 
Yeah , I'm totally still playing that game , so message me a number . Why don't my FAMILY MEMBERS want to know what I think of them ?? 
0901 : My youngest friend and one of my best friends . It seems insane that there's such a huge age difference between us - you're so mature . Yet when we're together we act like 5 year olds . No one else can bring out the silly side of me quite like you can . If someone thinks that they are random , they should check out our formspring wars . You're always there to make me laugh or to just hold me . I love you so much ! 
22 the second : Haha . Your pout - oh how I hate it . But I'll be nice in this one . There's something about your personality that won't let me stay mad at you . Even if you do aggravate me for some reason , I can't stay mad at you . And that's not really like me . You're a very intelligent person - you know way more than I do . =) 
7610 : I just met you recently , but you're an extremely nice person and fun to be around . I look forward to getting to know you better ! =) ( This is only the last 4 digits ) 
:) $&@\- : Okay girl . You are one of the CRAZIEST girls that I know . You are so outgoing and hilarious and you made me and mom laugh so much at the movies that time . " 
I'm so ready for this semester to be over . I just don't care anymore . 
Is sad because her observation is complete and she's going to miss her little kindergartners terribly ! =( 
I don't even know how I'm functioning this late into the day with only four hours of sleep . 
WOOT ! No more classes this semester !!! =D Now the question is - general admission or stadium ??? 
=D I am officially going to the Avenged Sevenfold concert in Huntington with < PROPFIRST > Bellew , Jaron < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner !!!!! Hopefully the boys can protect me from all the moshers and crowd surfers ..... I almost got killed at ROTR by a big goth chick ..... =D 
On my iPod !!!!!! :) 
Is ANGREH at < PROPFIRST > Bellew because he says she can't have a pet monkey !!! >.< 
My cream cheese is frozen .... >.< 
Okay , that's it - I'm transferring to some college in the tropics ! 
I now have a < PROPFIRST > Bieber poster hanging in my dorm room . Please don't ask - just blame < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Bunner 
Every time I listen to Skillet , I fall in love with them more and more ... <3 Have to go see them live again , this time with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > NightFaire . 
... I'm not really sure WHAT I'm doing right now , but it's definitely not writing my history paper .... 
Today has been ... interesting =) 
Finally home for Christmas !! Time to spend time with the ones I love ! <3 
<3 Remember when we'd ... stay up late and we'd talk all night , in the dark room lit by the TV light , For all the hard times in my life , those nights kept me alive . <3 
Going to Beckley with < PROPFIRST > Bellew - if he ever finishes getting ready ! 
Just checked my grades - 4.0 - this will make my Christmas even merrier =) 
Yay - just got an early Christmas present . New touch screen cell and we now have unlimited texting =D 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > =D BUT not only is it Christmas < PROPFEMALE > - it's also my most amazing boyfriend , < PROPFIRST > Bellew ' s birthday ! <3 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas < PROPFEMALE > everyone ! 
Been a terrific Christmas so far . But I think it's time for bed now . Have a great Christmas !!! 
Terrific < PROPFIRST > tmas ! Now I'm keeping < PROPFIRST > hostage ! 
Straightened my hair for the first time in ages - and I'm amazed at how long it is . =) 
So here I am with tons of rock music on my iPod , getting pumped about an a7x concert that I'm going to in a few weeks , and all I have listened to for days is < PROPFIRST > Swift .... 
So after having my iPod for a week now , I am sure of two things . iTunes sucks - did when I had my old iPod , does now , and always will . And the Genius playlist thing isn't so genius . 
My brother takes longer baths than any female I know . Which equals cold water . Which equals grumpy < PROPFEMALE > >.< 
How is it that such a small dog can get me and everything else completely soaked when I bath him ? 
So Jaron has a new puppy . I think it's about time that I got that monkey I wanted ... =D 
It's kinda pathetic that I'm upset that I received an extra scholarship , but with the way Concord is , that means it'll lower my grants and I'll probably end up owing them MORE money than I did initially . >_< 
Ugh , college next week . Rawr . 
Anyone else have Educ 319 ? 
On my way to < PROPFEMALE > Garden in a few ! If < PROPFIRST > ever finishes getting ready . 
Had a terrific birthday . Thanks for all the birthday wishes - I am blessed to be surrounded by such incredible people ! <3 
Frozen orange juice and almond milk . Yay . >.< 
And after 4 hours of being stuck on 77 and taking a detour , I am home 
If Jaron < PROPFIRST > would try out for American Idol , he'd be one of those they'd air on tv for everyone to get a laugh out of . 
Terrific night - Hollywood Undead was amazing and a7x was absolutely beautifully wonderful . Now it's time for bed 
Will be heading back to college once < PROPFIRST > is finished getting ready ... Slow boyfriend >.< 
Looks like another year of rotr for me !!!!!!!! :) 
The weekend ... Time to relax and have fun , right ? But no , not for me . So much to do , so many projects and assignments that must be done when all I want to do is spend time with those that Iove . 
Rawr .... Stupid apps . Definitely don't think that those people have been stalking my photos . 
I am sick . I am exhausted . I need to catch up on my sleep . I should not go to my 8am class tomorrow , but I will feel guilty if I don't .... 
I'm sorry but I seriously CANNOT believe people are actually pumped about this < PROPFIRST > Bieber movie .... 
It's official . Second year of ROTR and taking my dear ones to a concert this summer . Sounds great :) 
Wedding in a little more than 4 hours - time for my hectic day to truly begin =) 
Wedding was beautiful !! Now we are Concord bound 
I wish I had my car up here ... I'd be at Pipestem right now .... =( 
So beautiful outside . And I'm stuck in class until 5 =( 
My dog likes Fun Dip ! :) 
Blah . Berkey paper . >.< 
Sleepy . Counting down the days until spring break =) 
I can see my future now . Children's books scattered everywhere . The house a mess and filled to the brim with stuff for my class . Me up until the late hours making last minute changes to lesson plans and creating stuff for lesson activities . Stressful ? Yes . Worth it ? Absolutely =) 
Ugh , terrific ! How in the heck am I supposed to fix this ??? 
Over an hour left of work and there is absolutely nothing to be done . 
It's Friday , classes are cancelled , I don't have to work today , we actually have an excuse to go get some decent food , AND I GET TO SEE < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > NightFaire TODAY ! Doesn't get much better than this . 
Had an AMAZING time hanging out with ZEEMOSTAWESOME people in the world - < PROPFIRST > Bellew , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > NightFaire ! 
Blah . Fun weekend so far , but next week is looming ahead - lesson plans and tests and quizzes , oh my ! 
Blah . Nasty weather >.< 
Definitely a rent a movie and cuddle up to my baby kinda day =D 
Hmm ... I vote that spring break starts NOW ! 
Spring break is so so so close !! Why can't I fast forward to Friday ?? 
Dumb fire alarms .... 
Time to get this assignment finished so I can get into bed . One class tomorrow and then work for 2 hours and then SPRING BREAK ! =D 
I feel that I have to make this statement . Facebook friends , please learn proper grammar . I know I'm not perfect - no one is . But some people SERIOUSLY missed something in elementary school .... 
Finally ! A week of relaxing , hanging with family , and ... a lot of homework .... 
The more I listen to these bands , the more excited I get about ROTR . It's gonna be absolutely INCREDIBLE 
Getting ready to head out with some awesome people =) 
Going to see Beastly with my baby ! =D 
Beastly was amazing !! But seriously - the guy is SO Much more attractive when he's supposed to be ugly .... 
Grrrrr rain . Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr car . :( 
Lame cold nasty rain/snow ALL WEEK LONG !!! That's okay because I'm headed to < PROPFEMALE > in a week where it is 70 degrees =D 
Take a dangerous journey across Sewell Bridge ? Check . Explore an old abandoned house that is miraculously still standing ? Check . Climb onto a stopped train ? Check . Jump in front of a MOVING train ? Check . :D 
Dear college , please go away . 
Eating a luncheable while I study for a Berkey quiz . =) 
Going to bed at1 ??? I am overwhelmed with JOY that I'm going to sleep this early . =D 
Is SO thankful that all none of the classes I need next semester overlapped . I'll be able to graduate when I want =D 
People's pointless complaints honestly do make me laugh . Don't complain of something that you put yourself into ... =D 
So beautiful outside ! =D 
In 12 hours or less , I'll be on my way to < PROPFEMALE > . Gonna be a busy evening =D 
... Maybe I should just ignore this fire alarm . 
In < PROPFEMALE > . LONG drive and got sick , but I did see a dead armadillo ! :) 
Today's a lazy kind of day . :) 
It's a beautiful day ! And for once , I'm not gonna let ANYTHING or ANYBODY ruin that =D 
Math 305 has to be the biggest waste of my time ever . 
The fact that I don't have history class has made my day so much more pleasant ! =D 
Grrr ... why must I be an overachiever AND a procrastinator ?? The two DO NOT mix well together ! 
Jury duty AGAIN ???? What the heck ?!?!? 
It's SO COLD ! What happened ?? =( 
I'm so confused about when I have to take the Praxis . Everyone keeps telling me COMPLETELY different things ... =( 
Blah . :( 
McDonald's sounds REALLY good right about now .... 
Stressful day of a stressful week of a stressful month of a stressful semester ??? DEFINITELY means a McDonald's break ! 
Got in to all of my classes ! =D All 21 hours .... =D 
I personally believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . The bible says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . 
Dear Berkey paper , go away . And don't come back . 
Little brother shakes dog to where it makes funny noises . Little brother quits for a minute , then says \I like that noise .. \ " and proceeds to shake Havok . Anyone else think that Jaron is being abusive ???? " 
Lol , controversial questions on Facebook ! Yay ! 
Being somewhat productive . Considering my usual choice of procrastination , this is a big step for me . =) 
So < PROPFIRST > said that education majors are weird . I asked him why and he replied \You guys are just so .... teacher-ish ! \"" 
BEAUTIFUL outside ! Hmmm , Pipestem with < PROPFIRST > Bellew later . He has NO idea , but we ARE going !
