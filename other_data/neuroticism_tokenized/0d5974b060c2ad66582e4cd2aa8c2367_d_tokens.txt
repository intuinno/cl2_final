you know how you always see the sticker on the fuel pumps at the gas stations that says gas contains at least 10% ethanol ? the companies making the ethanol are pushing the epa to increase that amount to 15% which in turn lowers the life of the cars and increasing fuel consumption ... and on top of that ethanol forms formic acid which like sulfuric acid contributes to the issues that alternative fuels are working to fix 
i got to installing my coilovers last night and i got the rears and 1 front on without breaking anything but on the last bolt on the entire install it broke ... so now my car is on < PROPFIRST > stands without a front strut assembly in the parking lot on a friday ... thanks murphy youre the best
