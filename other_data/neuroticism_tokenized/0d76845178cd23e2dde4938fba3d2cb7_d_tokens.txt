I'm bored , what should I do ? 

So ended up singing karaoke and playing Munchkin on New Years < PROPFEMALE > . I'm off to a good start on my resolutions just got to take it one day at a time . 
Just paid for my college classes and books . Been working on my D&D campaign today , a little bit of progress . Now I've got to get ready to meet < PROPFIRST > for lunch , I'm starving ! 
I just spent 8 1/2 hours doing my finals - I want my temples massaged . Oh how I wish we had a jacuzzi bathtub . I don't want to think anymore tonight . 
All done with my online semester , whoot ! Now on-campus classes start tomorrow at CBC . 
Just got a kitchen table , whoot ! Now our small apartment appears more cluttered , got to reorganize . 
got two of my exams back got a 97 in political science , which I was shocked at cause it was my least favorite and an 83 in biology . YAY !! 
Two weddings in one month ... love is in the air ! 
First day of photography class today - kind of boring but has potential . Only two more nights in my ECE class - kind of sad , because it's been a lot of fun . Now I need to get to work finishing the final project . I feel like I'm the turtle in race , sure bu 
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar , The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart . 
Three things I love : my boyfriend , my baby , going to school Three things I hate : exes , hypocrites , mean/rude people - sometimes all three can be wrapped up in one 
Finished my ECE Class ; I did a pretty good job on my final project :) 
I can't believe I spent all day in front of this computer screen . I need to get out . 
I get to finally update my prescription and get new glasses tomorrow - Yay ! 
is going to go camping this weekend . 
is feeling extremely pregnant right now and < PROPMALE > is kicking/headbutting in the same spots and it's starting to hurt a little . 
is loving music and has a lot of cleaning to catch up on today , also needs to make room for the baby 
finally got my computer fixed , yay ! Got my grade back from ECE class got an A+ , whoot ! Now I've just got photography left and I'm having difficulties with my portrait shot 
< PROPMALE > is crushing my rib cage and making it hard to breath . He needs to stop stretching it's hurting his mama . 
Went to the hospital today - 100% sure it's a boy now . He's healthy , everything is measuring at 32.5 weeks , but his legs are measuring at 34 weeks , so he's got long legs like his daddy . I'm doing okay just got sentenced to bed rest . 
My b-day is coming up next Friday , whoot ! My due date is getting closer and I know I still need to buy the basics . And I feel like I'm having morning sickness again , I'm trying tums out , but I feel like it's making it worse . 
Just had a C-section today , baby is still in recovery - he needs to get stronger lungs 
Baby's doing better -- phone needs to be charged . :( 
they let me hold him and change his diaper last night :) He's still under the oxygen hood . They're doing an x-ray now to see how he's progressing . 
< PROPFIRST > was able to hold the baby without any extra air being needed this morning , looks like he's doing a lot better . They're putting him under a light to help with something in his skin , but it might be as soon as 24 hours before we can take him home :) 
I just spent an hour and a half on my homework and lost it 
Just made double chocolate chip cookies and they are yummy :) 
Spending time with my mom and step-sister today . Lunch and Pictures with < PROPFEMALE > are on the schedule . Mailing off Christmas cards as well - kind of on the late side but at least they're going out . I realized I'm missing addresses from people . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Just gave < PROPMALE > a bath and he looks like he's about to go to sleep again . I'm about to watch \The Ugly Truth \"" 
Just got done exercisiing , the workout use to be easy but not so anymore . I need to get back in shape , not just for me but < PROPMALE > too . 
I just took the what letter will your soulmate's name start with and got the result Result : The Letter S Bonus fortunes : You will meet at : the supermarket . Your first kiss will be : sexy . You'll build your dream house in : Sacramento . Your children will be : smart . < PROPFIRST > is my soulmate , so they got that right and darn tooting < PROPMALE > is definitely smart :) And < PROPFIRST>'s family lives in Sacramento so who knows ? 
I feel so good after taking a showering =) 
I've been cleaning for 3 hours straight and still have a lot to do 
Spent the day cleaning the living room and kitchen and it looks pretty good . That's another resolution : to keep the house clean . Just got to clean the bathroom and bedroom tomorrow . Also going to the gym at 6:30 am , got to get some sleep 
Got back from the gym : walked on the treadmill at an incline for 30 < PROPFEMALE > . and lifted weights for like only 15 < PROPFEMALE > . Going same time tomorrow . Started going through < PROPMALE>'s clothes - time to get rid of the one's that don't fit anymore . 
Little One's got a cold :( 
Little One is no longer sick . I had a pretty good day today . 
I lost my purse :( 
found out purse is with stepbrother 
Anybody want to join an anime club ? It meets Saturdays . On a side note , Still haven't got my hair done , I'm beginning to think it's a sign that I shouldn't get purple highlights . 
< PROPMALE > just fell asleep again . I love it when he laughs in his sleep . He must be having good dreams . 
Morning classes are kicking my butt . I'm taking naps with my baby boy again . 
My computer broke so I can't check my account that much . I lost some pics and video of < PROPMALE > :( I'm bummed . But on a good note I'm doing rather well in school , even with the lack of sleep . 
We finally have a somewhat working computer , so I'll actually be able to check on this every now and then . :) 
< PROPMALE > is now saying a lot of small phrases . He can now say : I got it , I got you , I did it , I'm done . And he can kind of say I love you . 
Apparently our computer won't let me open up any of my emails :( 
Just got back from the concert . It was pretty good , but very loud . I'm very tired now ! 
Thanks everyone for the happy birthdays . I had fun at the concert . It was a great birthday present from < PROPFIRST > . Too bad chevelle canceled , but the other bands were still really good . < PROPMALE>'s birthday turned out pretty good , hopefully I'll make more friends with ppl who have kids so < PROPMALE > will have more kids his age at his next bday . 
Getting ready to go to dinner with my mom , then we're taking < PROPMALE > to his first hockey game . 
I'm having another baby boy ! 
I signed < PROPMALE > up for music classes today . He seemed to enjoy the class , but didn't like waking up early . I've also got him on a list to join a mommy and me waddler's dance class , but I have to wait until they get three more members to sign up before they start . 
I don't think I'm taking < PROPMALE > to music class today . It's getting harder to go , wish it wasn't so far away . < PROPMALE > is too tired to really enjoy it when we're there . It's a total commute of two hours and they switched the location a little so the bus that we have to catch back only comes every hour so I have to wait 30-40 < PROPFEMALE > after class to catch the bus . totaling the time gone to 3 1/2 hours for just a 30 < PROPFEMALE > class . 
My mom took < PROPMALE > again today . Gives me more time to clean the house . It's getting better each day . Got to have it looking good for < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST>'s Mom :) 
< PROPMALE > is making me read him the same books over and over agian . I'm happy he likes to read books but can't there be variety ? You can only read Go , Dog , Go and Baby Woof Woof so many times before it drives you crazy , lol . 
Fiddlesticks must be going through her first heat , because she won't stop meowing , it's been driving me crazy all night . She woke me up three times last night with her meowing and demanding to be petted . I can't quite stay awake at 4 am to pet her . 
Christmas is coming up fast and I still haven't gone christmas shopping . 
< PROPMALE > spent the day with my mom and apparently ate the whole time , lol . I got the living room , hallway and < PROPMALE>'s room clean . Still have a lot to do before the baby comes but I've been having contractions almost every day since sunday . 
Have a feeling < PROPMALE > is going to wake up in the middle of the night . Went to bed extra early 7:30 pm tried to wake him up at 8:30 pm but he didn't stir , so just going to let him sleep until he wakes on his own . We have no plans tomorrow so it won't be that bad . 
Getting ready to go to holiday bazaars with my mom :) 
Having trouble sleeping tonight . 
first snow of the season , yay ! It's beginning to look a lot like christmas . 
Spending the day watching movies with my family while snow coats the outside . Seems the doctor was wrong about < PROPFIRST > being born this weekend . It feels like he's going to wait a while , but who knows . 
Having contractions , think I might be starting to go in labor , but not sure . 
thinking of getting red highlights 
Having hard time getting < PROPMALE > to sleep these nights . 
This makes two nights in a row that < PROPMALE > has slept through in his crib since < PROPFIRST > came home . Woot ! 
Just put < PROPMALE > to bed , now < PROPFIRST > is wide awake . < PROPFIRST > is being a little piglet . 
This christmas season is going by too fast . The boys ' are going to get so spoiled . Our bedroom has been taken over with presents . 
< PROPMALE>'s going to his cousin's b-day party today . I get time to catch up on sleep and house work :) 
I've been updating/uploading photos on facebook and I'm finishing up a couple scrapbooks . I get my family photos tomorrow afternoon and will finally be able to mail off my christmas cards . 
< PROPFIRST > and I celebrated christmas today since he works on the 25th ; I'll put up photos soon . 
Got our Roku today ; it's awesome ! 
Cleaning the kitchen 
Oh and I lost 20lbs this month :) 
Playing with my new phone . lost everyones number 
My new number is 509-205-9648 
just burnt my finger making pasta ; it stings really bad 
Had fun playing with < PROPMALE > today , he is so smart and is getting more rythme 
I'm so sore from exercising . I can't wait to go back to college :) 
had fun tonight . it was so good to get out of the house . 
Having a good day . Went to lunch and family expo with my mom . Now < PROPMALE > is passed out on the floor . 
Felt good going to the gym . My skin always feels good after the steam room . 
My workout partner said that I've gotten a lot toner since we last worked out together . That maid me smile , thanks . 
Got contacts today :) 
< PROPMALE > made < PROPFIRST > smile today , by blowing his tongue at him , it was cute . 
Went to Gold's Gym and did the BodyCombat class ; it was a pretty fun class . 
I miss having ppl come over and < PROPFEMALE > out , 
I'm happy and want to celebrate with everyone 
I'm drunk ; < PROPFIRST > and I lost the camera kinda sad about that hope we find it soon . 
Sent < PROPFIRST > to get a cpl of alcoholic beverages he came back with quite alot , lol 
Goodnight to all ! 
drunk + facebook = not a good idea , lol 
kids are asleep , now I really need to start cleaning . 
I had a good time the other night , thanks to everyone who came . 
I'm sick :( 
Feeling better . Just played DDR for about an hour and a half burned 300 cals and did a 10 < PROPFEMALE > pilates workout . 
Just got done doing the bodypump class at the gym ; enjoed it more than I thought I would . 
Got an ipod for v-day ; playing with it now :) 
I've got a month to train for the St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day Foot Race . I'm going to do the 5km , it'll be my first race . I'm nervous cause I haven't even ran a mile since I got out of the Navy . Intense training will be a must . 
Lost 5 lbs . and an inch off my waist this weigh-in . I'm fixing the diet , so I'll do better next weigh-in . I'm starting to really enjoy working out :P 
Just burned 295 calories playing DDR , now going to do a 10 < PROPFEMALE > pilates video before taking a shower and going to bed 
Just did week 1 , day 2 of #c25k with @couch5k ! 
Anyone know any good activities to do with an 18 month old ? 
Just played cars with < PROPMALE > , read to him and gave him a bath , now he's playing with fiddlesticks while I take care of < PROPFIRST > . 
Didn't realize happy tree friends was an adult cartoon , until the first death scene , which < PROPMALE > laughed at . 
Realizing I might be pushing myself to hard , so going to take a break tomorrow and give my muscles some time to recoup . 
Been cleaning the bedroom most of the day and ended up killing 5 spiders so far . 
< PROPFIRST>'s getting a D&D campaign ready , and the set-up and intro sound very good ; can't wait ' till he's ready to start . 
At walmart for my follow up apt for contacts . Thinking of going to starbucks afterwards . 
Anyone want to go to the gym with me tomorrow ? I have two 14 day passes if you're not a member . 
Lost 2 lbs this week ! 
Just did week 2 , day 1 of #c25k with @couch5k ! 
Ended up not going to the gym today ; I had a lot of cleaning to do . I'll have to make up with a lot of DDR tonight . 
Just did week 2 , day 2 of #c25k with @couch5k ! 
:( Dropped my Ipod - worst luck with electronics ever . 
Checked the result < PROPFEMALE > of the st. < PROPFEMALE>'s day foot race 5k run- I finished in 42 < PROPFEMALE > 50 sec , placed 460th out of 575 . Got to train a lot to finish closer to the top . 
< PROPFIRST > rolled over for the first time this morning ; I'll post a video later :) 
Just did week 3 , day 1 of #c25k with @couch5k ! 
I love the smell of the pool , too bad I forgot my swimsuit . Just burned 800 calories ( including the walk home ) 
Great , < PROPMALE > just got done being sick now I am . I hate being sick . 
Watching the Contender ; I want to go to a live boxing match . 
< PROPMALE > is so smart ! 
today's ge t-t ogether was much smaller than anticipated and hoped . Oh well , there was just enough spaghetti , which tasted awesome ( < PROPFIRST > made it from scratch ) , to feed us and more delicious cookies for the family . 
Closing the night with cookies and coffee while watching the Contender , I love the show , boxers are so sexy ! 
So on my way back home from the gym a guy in a truck honked , waved at me and pulled over . I thought it was < PROPMALE > coming over to get his coat so I walked over and was about to get in , then realized it wasn't < PROPMALE > . I've got to be more careful . 
Just had one of the best eggs I've ever cooked . It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt and pepper . 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > toons with my sons . 
< PROPMALE > has been saying \apple pie\ " all day ... I think he wants some . " 
< PROPMALE > is getting better at brushing his teeth . And he gives me a kiss every night when I sing him to sleep . He's such a sweetheart . 
< PROPMALE > has been real clingy these past two days ; holding on to my pocket as I walk , constantly wanting to be held . And < PROPFIRST > has started screaming for the heck of it , not angry screaming more like wanting to hear himself . I'd like a little me time . Glad < PROPFIRST>'s days off are coming up . 
1st day of classes this morning , nice to be back at CBC after taking a year off . Afterwards had lunch with my mom , then we went shopping . Got < PROPMALE > even more toys ; he's so spoiled . 
yeah , so my email has got a virus on it ( think it had something to do with linking it up with my ipod ) , so if you get any messages from me don't open them . I don't really use it to email people anyway . If you need to contact me facebook is the best option . 
I accidentally left my coffee out , pretty sure < PROPMALE > drank it cause I don't see a spill anywhere . 
Yay ! < PROPMALE > is spending the day with my mom so I get time to myself and with < PROPFIRST > . 
< PROPFIRST > really doesn't like it being quiet , I have to put music on or a show or he'll start crying . 
< PROPFIRST > made a comment about something being the oldest trick in the book , so < PROPMALE > handed him a book . 
Hope the weather is better in the morning for my 5K , the boys will be going to \breakfast with the Easter bunny\ " with my mom while I run . " 
Need a babysitter tues and Thursday from 7- 12:10 pm and Wednesday from 7- 10:30 next week . 
< PROPMALE > + quiet = trouble . Found out < PROPMALE > can now turn door knobs and opened our bedroom door , not sure of the damage yet just no he spilled my coffee all over . 
Ran the 5k in 41 < PROPFEMALE > 10 sec , about a < PROPFEMALE > better than last time . 
Can anyone babysit Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday morning ? 
Yay got a babysitter , now I don't have to miss a week of classes ! 
It's my anniversary with < PROPFIRST > . He surprised me by coming home early with a lot of alcohol - who wants to come over and party ? 
< PROPMALE > can count to 3 ! He's so smart ! 
Playing magic taking shots everytime damage is taken . I'm totally getting drunk . 
I'm very drunk ! haven't been this drunk in a long time . 
Every now and then I find myself wanting to flirt with a guy/girl and then I slap myself and think < PROPFEMALE > you have the most amazing guy in the world . < PROPFIRST > I love you so much ! 
Woke up feeling sick in a very cold house , < PROPFIRST > forgot to close the sliding glass door . 
< PROPMALE>'s on the table counting to three then jumping onto the couch or < PROPFIRST>'s lap . 
Apparently watching the baby brainworks : counting video causes babies to fall asleep . 
Oh that workout during body mechanics class is going to leave me sore . 
< PROPMALE > thinks mommy trying to ballet dance is funny . 
Made peanut butter cookies from a new boxed cookie mix and it doesn't taste that sweet :( 
Happy Easter ! 
< PROPMALE > can now say the word \stop\ " and is saying it a lot . " 
I've been on a little binge for the last couple days , time to get back up and start exercising again . 
Went through to invite people I know with kids in the area for a play date and realized I don't really know that many . I need to get more active in finding friends . I wish I had a car/license that'd probably help . 
< PROPMALE > just said , \happy\ " for the first time . " 
I hate calling customer service ! 
Asked < PROPMALE > if he wanted to take a bath , he said no . I'll wait ' til his show is over then he's getting one whether he wants to or not . 
Any one going to the < PROPMALE > Dunham concert ? 
I'm exhausted and have a huge headache , need to take a nap before < PROPFIRST > comes home . 
Bought my ticket to the < PROPMALE > Dunham concert , looks like I'm going by myself . 
I'm so happy to be home , went to the mall from 1- 4:30 pm then had lunch with < PROPFIRST > then walked home - 3.5 < PROPMALE > . 
Oh how spoiled my kids are . They got new stuffed animals ( < PROPMALE > got < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > a classic tigger ) , and new outfits . 
I'm so tired of < PROPMALE > whining everytime I hold < PROPFIRST > . 
< PROPMALE > got mistaken for a girl again that makes two days straight that people have mistaken him for a girl . 
I got my strong interest profile results today . One of the top jobs they showed for me is a parks & recreation manager . I've never really put any thought into it before ; I should check it out . 
Heard < PROPMALE>'s tv turn on . < PROPMALE>'s out in the living room , so went to investigate - fiddlesticks ( our cat ) had pushed in the cassette which turned on the tv and started toy story . 
Trying to get < PROPMALE > to take a nap before we go to < PROPFEMALE>'s get together , he's fighting it . 
Had fun at the get together at < PROPFEMALE>'s . The kids played and watched < PROPMALE > the science kid while < PROPFEMALE > and I made mother's day cards . 
It's been an okay mother's day- took the kids to the park , making fish fillets for late lunch and getting ready to watch \what women want \"" 
So right now my plan is to get an Associate in Arts & Sciences with an Emphasis in Health & Physical Education transfer degree and then transfer over to WSU and get a Bachelor's degree in Psychology . 
I have so much more schooling left to do - a lot of science and math . 
so I just read the financial aid statement for CBC . According to it they only offer financial aid for up to 9 quarters . So this 2011-2012 school year will be the last year that I get financial aid . I'll have to look into getting a scholarship . 
So what I really want to be is a CPS Investigator , so I don't need the emphasis on health & physical education . I'll just get a regular AA and transfer and get a BA in either Psychology or Social Work or Human Services . 
< PROPFIRST > can now roll from his back to his front . He was rolling all around this morning . :) 
I've got to get an academic plan done before I can get any more financial < PROPFEMALE > . I scheduled it for next Wednesday . I did some computing myself and I think I'm done with my electives . So the only reason I won't be able to graduate next year is because I've been putting off math . :( 
just reread the complete guidelines for financial < PROPFEMALE > , so the < PROPMALE > of 9 quarters of financial < PROPFEMALE > is if you're going full time each quarter , if you're half time it's up to 18 and they allow two program changes up to 12 quarters . So I should be able to get financial < PROPFEMALE > for the rest of my schooling . 
And If my calculations are correct Fall 2012 will be my last quarter at CBC then I'll be able to transfer . I'll find out for sure next Wednesday . 
I think my toe is either broken , sprained or dislocated . I hit it against my dumbbells 2 1/2 weeks ago and it still hasn't healed if anything it feels worst , though I'm sure < PROPMALE > stepping on it all the time isn't helping . 
< PROPMALE > is addicted to popsicles . 
It seems that the house being clean and me cooking are correlated . When the house is clean I'm more inclined to cook . 
I just put strawberry cobbler in the oven . :) 
took the real age test and apparently I'm 29.1 , not as bad as I thought it was going to be . I just basically got to shed weight , eat more veggies , take in more vitamin D and not watch as much tv . 
< PROPMALE > ate dinner and took a bath and is watching < PROPMALE > before bed in 10 < PROPFEMALE > . It's so much fun watching his play progress . He also loves looking at pictures of himself and looking at himself in the mirror . 
I haven't been in an exercise mood today like I have been , so I kept my calorie intake low and did a 15 < PROPFEMALE > circuit workout while < PROPMALE > took his nap . 
I love my family ! < PROPMALE > is such a sweetheart and tells me he loves me and gives me kisses everyday . < PROPFIRST > smiles and raises his eyebrows at me . And < PROPFIRST > tells me he loves me and that I'm beautiful everyday . I'm truly blessed . 
I feel like going photo-walking today . I'll have to wait ' til I get home after I'm done with my meeting with my adviser to go through my academic plan . 
Why do cameras have to be so expensive . 
So I got my phone back it was suppose to get fixed , but it just started having the same problems , plus I can't get to my voicemail . I think I'm going to have to just buy a different phone . 
We all got a little spoiled from my mom today . I got a new summer outfit consisting of denim shorts , pink tank top and black flip flops . 
ok , I should probably try to cool it on the coffee , but I'm so addicted - it's hard . I've already gone through the calories I'm allowed on my diet , more than half of them came from coffee . so only going to drink water the rest of today and if i get hungry i'll eat an apple . 
fiddlesticks keeps eating < PROPMALE>'s watermelon . 
I'm so tired , but today was the worst day I had on my diet since I started my challenge so I got to get some more exercise in . ugh . 
I think I'll try and make it fun and do some DDR 
Just ran a mile in 11:46 which is an improvement from the last time when I ran it in 12:00 . 
Just did a 30 < PROPFEMALE > circuit workout and took a shower - my body feels pretty relaxed now 
! st measurement of my personal challenge - lost 2 in off my waist and 1/2 an inch off my hips . I'll have the weight loss update tomorrow morning . I should've lost weight with the loss in my waist we'll see how much ! 
I lost 4.5 lbs which is like 2.25 lbs a week which is good but i want it to a litttle more so I'll exercise a little more . I'll try to cutback on my coffee intake but I just got starbucks after the gym so not a good sign , lol 
I like the show , The Secret Life of the American Teenager , but it always feels like they're just lecturing each other . 
It's so hot in my apartment , the air condition doesn't work :( 
Got my permit renewed - this time I'm actually going to learn how to drive and take the test and get my license . I want to be able to visit my dad sometime soonish 
I'm watching Hoarders and I can't believe how people can live in that environment . It's even worst when they have kids , it's totally not fair for them . 
Went to the gym today and did the bodycombat class , had chinese food for dinner then cleaned the kitchen . < PROPMALE > was so excited to play with all the kids - he ran around in circles and threw bouncy balls toward a hoop that was too high for him . 
taking the children to the circus tomorrow night with my mom :) 
Just got back from the circus . < PROPMALE > enjoyed the elephant ride and the bear show , < PROPFIRST > enjoyed watching the jugglers . 
just watched the season finale of secrets of the American teenager - saddest season finale ever cried a lot . Now it's bed time . 
My kids are so cute , < PROPFIRST > Soto keeps trying to steal < PROPMALE > Soto's food . 
Any one have a car that < PROPFIRST > can use to take the driving test to get his license again ? He's a good driver . 
< PROPMALE > Soto said \please\ " yesterday for a Popsicle and \ " thank you\ " toady when I gave him his vitamin gummy . I must give most of the credit to < PROPMALE > videos \ " Please and Thank You\ " and \ " Best Manners . \ " He also went to the bathroom on the toilet today and counts to three with a lot of accuracy . He's growing up so fast . " 
I'm hoping < PROPFIRST > passes his driving test tomorrow to make our trip to seattle easier . Nervous about being away from the kids for a whole weekend . Excited about meeting Kaylea and all the stuff planned for seattle . 
I'm soon to be Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Soto ! < PROPFIRST > purposed last night ! I'm the happiest girl ever ! 
So , < PROPFIRST > and I are wondering out of curiosity how many people would be able to travel to a beach in Oregon ? a beach in WA ? a beach in CA ? or possibly Seaworld in San < PROPMALE > , CA for the wedding ? 
< PROPMALE > is being a little trouble maker today . He keeps getting into the kitchen drawers and sneaking into the bathroom and getting into the bathroom drawers . He also spilled my coffee twice today . Then on top of all that I caught him pushing a plush toy on < PROPFIRST>'s face - I know he was just trying to play with him , but he could have hurt him real bad . 
< PROPMALE > is slightly disturbing me - He keeps trying lay on top of < PROPFIRST > 
Won't be making it to the gym today - < PROPMALE > took too late of a nap . 
< PROPFIRST > got his first tooth while < PROPFIRST > & I were in Seattle . He's now starting on his second tooth and he's having a hard time teething . 
Knowing he had to go to bed soon , I discovered < PROPMALE > had thrown a bunch of toys in his crib . 
Money is not kind to me :( 
Looks like there are stumbling blocks to maneuver over before we can start saving for the wedding :( Hopefully I'll win a giveaway or the lottery and all will be fine . ( wishful thinking I know ) 
< PROPMALE > blows kisses now :) 
I went to the gym today , the kids were in such a good mood ( enjoyed time playing with kids their age ) so I decided to take the scenic route home . It was nice : stopped at a park , pushed < PROPMALE > on a swing while he laughed then we walked the road that had the view of the river , it was gorgeous outside . But I forgot the route was so long so that on top of the bodypump class has made me very sore . 
< PROPMALE > had a good , full breakfast this morning eating a huge pancake all by himself . 
You could lead < PROPMALE > to food , but you can't make him eat it . He had a good hearty breakfast , but didn't eat much of a dinner . 
< PROPFIRST > reminds of < PROPFEMALE > the pooh sometimes - he just got his butt stuck under his bouncer . 
We found out < PROPFIRST > has low iron levels so he needs more protein . Apparently he takes after me and is a short , chubby baby he's in top 75% of weight I guess I was blind cause I thought he was just healthy . < PROPMALE > had perfect level of iron and is in the top 75% for height and has the perfect height-weight proportions . 
< PROPMALE > is eating the rind of a watermelon and he likes it . 
I won a free < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > pamper party . They have you set up an appt when they call but I can call and reschedule it . Right now it's scheduled July 13th at 3pm . I can have up to five friends who would be interested ? if your interested does the date/time work , if not what date/time would work ? 
< PROPMALE > is such a grouch when he wakes from his nap . 
I'm so glad I decided to look when the first assignment for my Native American Culture was due since it was due by midnight tonight . 
Just got some cleaning done , now all that's left is mopping the kitchen floor and cleaning the bathroom . 
< PROPMALE > is running around in circles and plopping onto the floor . He's so silly . 
< PROPMALE > likes his new bed , but when bed time came he wanted to be in his crib . 
Wounds from the mud run are healed or almost healed . 
Made Banana Waffles for breakfast . I thought they tasted ok , but < PROPMALE > really liked them and scarfed them down . 
< PROPMALE>'s vocabulary is growing everyday . 
Put a picture of < PROPFIRST > & me at the beginning of our relationship as my profile picture . We've changed a lot since then . 
I just asked < PROPMALE > if he would rather take dance classes or gym classes and he said \dance\ " followed by laughter :) " 
I asked < PROPMALE > to play with < PROPFIRST > so he started handing him all his toys - it was very cute . 
Just got my first English 102 assignment done . I prefer taking English classes on campus , it's so much easier to stay focused and motivated . 
Had a good day : spending time with < PROPFIRST > and the boys , getting my homework done , having smores and getting to know < PROPFEMALE > . Now it's time to go to bed . Goodnight Everyone ! 
Got my Native American History homework in right on time , however I only was able to answer 12 of 15 questions . I need to do some extra credit . I hate online classes in the summer . I have homework due everyday . 
< PROPFIRST > keeps scooting his booty down the hallway trying to get to < PROPMALE>'s room . When I catch him he tries to scoot faster - he's so cute . 
Damn the fine print of wedding venues . 
I got my homework done for the day . It's so much better to get it done earlier than waiting last second . 
You know it's summer when the moment you step outside you feel like your getting bitten by bugs everywhere . 
Just took a look at my schedule for fall - four classes , tow of which are online , what was I thinking , lol . I might have to take different classes though because < PROPFIRST > has a new shift change coming up . 
Out comes < PROPMALE > laughing while running around naked . 
Yay ! < PROPMALE > is finally eating ! 
Going on a date with < PROPFIRST > tonight . About time , lol . It'll be nice to spend time with him without the kids around . 
I wish I could sleep right now . I woke up at 6:30 am and cleaned non-stop til 3:00 pm with < PROPFIRST > helping out too . He did a good job ! The place looks great in my opinion . Now I need a nap , but I can't cause I got to keep the kids out of trouble . 
< PROPMALE > can now lift a 10 pound dumbbell . 
Finally got the air conditioning working !

My poor little < PROPFIRST > woke up at 3am with a fever and sore throat . Every time he tries to drink his bottle he starts coughing . 
< PROPFIRST > is feeling better . His fever went down , but he still has a bit of a sore throat . He won't drink his bottle right now cause of the sore throat but will eat solids , so I fed him mashed potatoes for lunch . 
I wish < PROPFIRST>'s mom , < PROPFEMALE > was here . < PROPFIRST > has been so fussy today and I have a huge headache now . 
I tried to move < PROPFIRST > from < PROPMALE>'s room back out to the living room and < PROPMALE > got mad at me , so I'm letting them play together but I'm keeping an eye on them . 
I've watched Toy Story 3 everyday for the past couple of days . I'm glad it's a good movie or I'd be going nuts . I'd say this is < PROPMALE>'s favorite movie right now . 
Where's < PROPFIRST > ? Oh don't mind him , he's just hiding in the corner eating < PROPMALE>'s cupcake . 
< PROPMALE > now likes to pick out his clothes and says , \I too\ " in response to me saying I love you . " 
< PROPFIRST > had me cracking up this evening , he's so funny . 
I love the sound of my kids laughter feeling the room . 
< PROPMALE > started saying please yesterday , but it comes out as peas . 
I wish my camera was charged ; I'm missing out on some good photos . < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are playing real well together . It kind of looks like they are playing fetch , lol . < PROPMALE > keeps throwing a ball and < PROPFIRST > grabs it and brings it back to him . So cute . 
Had fun at the party . I always have fun when I see my kids having fun . And the tether ball tournament was fun too . < PROPMALE > got spoiled ! If he didn't have too many toys before he definitely has too many now . Tons of left over cake if anybody wants some . 
< PROPMALE > got sad today at the gym childcare because he got put in time out for the first time . He was sobbing ; I felt bad for him . 
< PROPFIRST > clapped and said \yay\ " for the first time tonight . " 
According to my mom , I need to find < PROPMALE > some friends so he gets used to playing with kids his age . Any two year olds out there looking for a playmate ? 
Signed < PROPMALE > up for music classes since gym and dance didn't work out with the scheduling so hopefully the music classes work out . 
< PROPFIRST > has started crawling . < PROPMALE > has started doing the dishes with me and saying thank you more . I'm very proud of my kids . 
Just finished my homework . :) I thought I did poorly on my last math quiz , turns out she has to grade the written answers herself and I actually got a 93% much better than the 44% I thought I had . And i just took the next quiz and got a 100% . I feel a lot better .
