Had my one class today , got out of class at 12:15 , raced back to the dorm . Sat down , got all my homework done . Realized i have nothing else to do at the moment . Tried finding my roomate , remembered he's taking a vow of silence for 3 days . FML 
Woke up this morning with a headache . Went to 2 classes . Ate . Back at dorm ... nap time . Class at 5:30 , i should be up by 4 . 
I have climbed highest mountains/ I have run through the fields/ only to be with you/ I have run , I have crawled/ I have scaled these city walls/ only to be with you/ but I still haven't found what I'm looking for 
Lookin like ill be alone int he dorm again tonight ... 2 roommates went home the weekend , the other is looking to go to a Magic tournament . Shame my cards aren't up to date or else i would go :/ 
I'M THE < PROPMALE > OF EVERYTHING !

DUDE NO WAY ! Back to the Future marathon on A&E ... guess im not doing my homework until later tonight :p 
Third Back to the Future has been on , almost over . Homework after it's off xD 
\Don't cry because it's over 
Who just sat down for 2 hours and banged out a project in one sitting ? This guy right here . 
Reach out and torch someone 
Maybe today I'll finally get the balls to talk to that girl who called me handsome ... 
Bored , posting a poem I wrote for my Creative Process class : 
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH ! 
Well , after taking 6 different buses between the 2 campuses , I've finally signed up for pay :) \ 
I can official start work . 
Rolling gouts of oily flames filled the evening sky , piles of collected corpse set ablaze by the Burnas at the rear . Plaz Git finished off the last of the remaining Space Marines , crushing what little life was left in the human in his mighty steel ' klaw ' , pistons straining against the < PROPFEMALE>'s armor . As plate and bone gave way , a sickening snap broke the man in half . 
Sat down for an hour worrying about this short story rough draft i need to write for Fiction . Needs to be 8 pages minimum , i already have 4 . I has a talent i guess :3 
Done with class for the day ... got nothing to do , no homework ... nap time ? 
Just got the word from the boss : I start this week :) 
Just finished an 11 < PROPFEMALE > short story that was only supposed to be 8 < PROPFEMALE > s .... whoops :P 
Job meeting tonight shortly after my night class . Ill end up figuring out my hours for the weekend finally . Waiting anxiously for tomorrow , hopefully be able to play some Warhammer with the Multiple Realities club . 
Just got hours for the weekend ... ugh =.= \ 
Friday and Saturday aren't bad , basically just closing . Sunday's ridiculous though ... oh boy .. \ 
One of those \I have a job ! ( :D ) .... wait .... I have a job ( T.T )\ " moments . " 
It doesn't think , it doesnt feel\ 
It doesn't laugh or cry\ 
All it does from < PROPFEMALE > till dusk\ 
Is make the soldiers die\ 
- Onean children rhyme 
just played his first game of Warhammer 40,000 . The result ? Victory ! My Warboss crushed the enemy's commander to death with his Klaw :3 \ 
Other than that , I succeeded to do nothing but fail with my other special units . Rank and file Orks are superior . \ 
Tonight was a good night . 
met a very cool person today and sees something special ... \ 
Things are turning around :3 
And so the goliath reared back his head as the knight's < PROPMALE > plunged into his breast . Arms spread , mouth agape and eyes aflame with fury . Mighty fist held true around the steel pole jutting from his open wound , blood pouring down that sturdy shaft . His flaming eyes met those of the knight , and with one last defiant wail , the goliath yanked the < PROPMALE > deeper into his chest , rupturing his heart . 
Woke up this morning , felt like i got hit by a bus . Went to my classes , impatient as my grandfather . Saw < PROPFEMALE > afterward , was a great time ! After she left it all came rushing back >.< \ 
Now im drinking tea , orange juice and eating soup ( not all at one lol ) . I think im getting a cold ... 
is considering on taking tomorrow off from classes >.< \ 
I wanna feel better but don't think i can if I try and keep up with all this work :( \ 
Suggestions ? 
went to the school's doctor today and found out that my sinuses are going crazy ! Got some meds ( from the doc ) , tea and cookies ( thanks to < PROPFEMALE > :3 ) . Taking the day off , just going to relax and watch some tv in between naps >.< 
Announcment :\ 
My school's web-access program is freakin ' stupid ! Therefore , I am forced to uninstall my virus protection program and install McAffee instead ... \ 
I might not be on for a few hours due to the long and tedious process of uninstalling and then reinstalling a horrible program on my laptop ( class aside ) . 
Holy crap , I got like 30 \happy birthday\ " wishes xD\ 
So , why're you posting at 5:18 AM < PROPFIRST > ? Oh , see , I feel like crap ... again -.- \ 
I woke up five mins ago , almost unable to breathe . My throat kills again , my head is pounding and my stomach is starting to ache . In all of my attempts to get better , I seem to have only gotten worse . Screw this , I'm taking another day off . 
I hate being sick ... 
Alright , last day I'm taking off of school this semester >.< \ 
This weekend is going to be jammed full of make up work 
Homework is all done ! I'm all caught up aside from the test that I missed :3 
Cards are sorted , reading done , everything starting to fall back into place . I hate recouping after being out of school for a few days -.- 
Boom ! Boom ! Boots the size of oxcarts , then an axe like a falling sun . Elves scattered . Trees scattered . Even the hills ran for the hills ! 
Just found out that for the first time in 3 weeks he can sing effectively :3 
just heated up some of Mr. LaSagna's stew . The man sure can cook ! 
In the void , only the C'Tan can hear you scream . \ 
In honor of the Halloween season : Necrons 
just made my housing deposit for next semester . And so , WCSU owns another small portion of my soul ... \ 
You win this time ... 
opened up both Elspeth Tirel AND Venser , the Sojourner today ... looks like my Magic the Gathering luck has finally come around xD 
was planning on finishing off a project today , but got 2 paragraphs into it and stopped . Oh well ., not due for a little while still , and it's halloween ! 
So here's my plan for Halloween : play some Magic , Listen to Protomen , and watch TV . Not exactly what i was hoping for ... but hey im not complaining ! 
Class schedule is looking AMAZING for next semester :\

BWAHAHAHA ! Hacked ! Okay , not really , but I still love you . :3 Love , < PROPFEMALE > <3 PS , this is what happens when you give me access to your computer . ;D 
Hello , my name is Skellum and i wear a silly hat . 
is having one of those \why am i here right now ? \ " days . " 
ok , so feeling nauseous just by breathing is a good enough reason to not go to class this morning , right ? 
It doesn't need to use its venom- it just needs you to know it can . 
is having the hardest time right now with this short story . I'm so outrageously unmotivated to do ANYTHING right now . 
What am I looking at ? Ashes dead man . 
is happy ! Much thanks go out to < PROPMALE > Bennetti for helping me out with Magic trades ! The old moss-covered stone is finally starting to roll . 
He loves as he hates : not the person exclusively , but the ideas they stand for . 
Three key things to know when a Dwarf is in your party : \ 
1 : NEVER insult , pull , offer advice or make snide comments about his beard . NEVER !!! \ 
2 : NEVER insult , poke fun at or make snide comments about his height . If you do , he'll promptly respond with an \Oh 
< PROPMALE > !! < PROPMALE > , you have to be the stupidest man on the planet to think this is a good idea ! Have you seen what you're wearing ?! That outfit makes you look like a sequined train wreck ! Look at you !! You're part of a twelve-headed Jackass ! This chorus is the feces that is produced when shame eats too much stupidity ! You people make me envy the deaf and the blind ! 
Have a pleasant Thanksgiving all ! 
dug through his old Yugioh cards over the vacation and found that a couple were worth quite a bit ! 
finally changed my pic for the event . 
is watching one of those off road trucker shows . They're driving up a 13 ft wide road in these massive trucks made out of WOOD , high in the mountains somewhere in < PROPFEMALE > . NOBODY in that country seems to understand the vague concept of operating a motor vehicle ... 4 accidents in the same episode , none of them the fault of the American drivers . 
... What did I tell you about leaving yourself logged on while I'm here ? X3 Loooove yooooooou ~ <3 \ 
-Your incredibly intelligent , wonderful , and absolutely amazing girlfriend . 
PUUUUUUUUUUPPPY ! 
Good job < PROPFIRST > , you did it again ... 
Yahtzee's thought process during the video game Amnesia : 
Dear idiots holding the door open , \ 
You are beyond annoying , and have no capacity to learn . Holding the door open ( despite the desk worker asking you polotely not to ) will cause the alarm to sound , which results in ear splitting beeps . That aside , I have no control over the bus schedule and am not the god of bus punctuality , therefore STOP ASKING ME WHEN THE BUS IS GOING TO COME . \ 
Thank you and good day . 
I love how there's different types of crazy people . There's crazy people who kill people , and then there's crazy people who dance on one foot in the middle of the side-walk with an icecream bar for tips on a daily basis . 
wants to wish everyone a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , a happy Chanukah , a wonderful Quanza and a most joyous Yule ! 
So , who has two thumbs and pulled a shiny Baneslayer Angel this morning ? THIS GUY ! 
is the proud owner of 3 new Dark Heresey Books . There's a great deal of reading to be done ... and I've already been reading for 2 hours . 
Life is very much like a collection of well written stories . Each volume is filled with chapters and these chapters are filled with dynamic characters that complement each other . Just like in any book you've read , people phase in and out of your life , but always remember : YOU are the author , and you get to choose the ending , no matter where your story takes you . 
Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name .... It can only be 1 word .... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you .... Don't just post a word & not copy , that's no fun . 
Who's got two thumbs and just got both of the Protomen albums off of Itunes ? -points to self with thumbs- This guy ! 
woke up this morning , went out to shovel . Came inside an hour later to eat lunch , only to return outside to continue where I left off . proceeded to shovel for 4 more hours . That was my day .

spending the next few days with my girl , away from home and ready for school to start . Having a blast either way :) 
I'm all moved into my dorm , almost everything unpacked , no sign of the roommates yet though . 
Decided on something new just now . \ 
Every day ( or at least , as often as I'm able , but only once daily ) I shall roll on the \Divinations\ " table in the Dark Heresy Rulebook ( a one hundred sided die ) . I will document the number I rolled 
Today's Divination :\ 
79 : \The only true fear is of dying with your duty not done . \"" 
Gah , weird day . I enjoyed my classes , but for some reason I'm really out of it all of a sudden . It wouldn't normally worry me , but for some reason it is . \ 
Maybe it's because I'm adjusting still ... \ 
Today's divination\ 
12 : \The pain of the bullet is ecstasy compared to damnation . \"" 
whoa ... whoa ... whoa ... \ 
whoa ... \ 
Teacher wants me to read half of a novel in 1 day ? ... I'm sorry , this isn't grad school . I feel this is not a reasonable thing to ask . Over 100 pages to read , and he expects notes and a SIMPLE discussion ? This isn't a kiddie book either ... this is everything regarding tragedy from Plato to modern-day analysts ... and this is a writing class how ? 
Yesterday's snow day was a good day indeed . Played some Gamma World with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Brown , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Shenanigans abounded , everything from making a gun out of the springs and casing out of a pogo gun using nothing but duct tape , to constructing a massive flail out of a punching bag , croquet hoops , wooden spikes and sheet metal . 
Oh < PROPMALE > . My name is < PROPFIRST > and I love my absolutely wonderful girlfriend so very , very much . I am also a silly puppy . :D 
Man , 2 snow days in a row ? I could get used to this 
All of my Dark Heresy stuff is done and all of the important pieces have shipped ! Excited for tomorrow to play with < PROPFEMALE > Fox La Sagna , JT Ledan , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > ! Stop having crazy dreams ! I don't care if they were prophesies of your demise and syphilis ! JT Ledan , < PROPFEMALE > Brown , we miss you dearly after that buffalo stampede . 
OK , so , The Deer < PROPMALE > plays something like the Tetris theme song about an hour or so into the movie ( really long wedding scene ) ... \ 
Made < PROPFEMALE > Fox La Sagna and I lol . 
Dear random resident who randomly decides to sit behind me at the desk waiting for the bus , \ 
The bus won't come for another 15 minutes ... please go back for your dorm and wait there . I don't care if it's warm here and if you got a good view of the bus stop . \ 
P.S. Stop opening the door for people and criticizing me on my job . 
Just got done with homework for Human Tragedy : Watch Full Metal Jacket . \ 
Best class ever . 
Reap what you sow , pay what you owe . 
Your Zombie Apocalypse Team is the first five people on your friends list . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Musket , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Table Ventre , JT Ledan and < PROPFIRST > Shepherd . Oh yeah , aint no damn rots gunna take us down ! 
Enjoying some of < PROPFEMALE > Scalia Justice's famous Homemade < PROPMALE > and Cheese . 
Today's enlightening truth : Nuclear meltdowns aren't nice . 
The girl you just called fat ? is starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The boy you just called stupid ? has a learning disability & studies over 4 hours a night . The girl you just called ugly ? spends hours in the mirror putting on makeup hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? is abused enough at home . There is more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying .
