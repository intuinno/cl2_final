Don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about . You know exactly where I'm coming from , and you throw it in my face . You take me for granted and scream when you don't get your way . Fuck you and your paranoia . You live the way you do by my whim . If it weren't for me , you'd be homeless , or worse . Grow up ....

Gandalf :\ 
End ? No , the journey doesn't end here . Death is just another path ... One\ 
that we all must take . The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back , \ 
and all turns to silver glass ... And then you see it . \ 
Pippin :\ 
What ? Gandalf ?... See what ? \ 
White shores ... and beyond , a far green country under a swift sunrise . \ 
Pippin : Well , that isn't so bad . \ 
Gandalf : No ... No it isn't . 
Eowyn : The women of this country learned long ago , those without swords can still die upon them . I fear neither death nor pain . \ 
Aragorn : What do you fear , my lady ? \ 
Eowyn : A cage . To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all < PROPMALE > of valor has gone beyond recall or < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Aragorn : You are a daughter of kings , a shield maiden of Rohan . I do not think that will be your fate . 
Arwen : And to that I hold . I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone . \ 
[ hands him her pendant ] \ 
Arwen : I choose a mortal life . \ 
Aragorn : You cannot give me this . \ 
Arwen : It is mine to give to whom I will . Like my heart . 
: You offer it to me freely ? I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this . \ 
Galadriel :\ 
In the place of a Dark Lord you would have a < PROPFEMALE > ! Not dark but \ 
beautiful and terrible as the Morn ! Treacherous as the Seas ! Stronger \ 
than the foundations of the Earth ! All shall love me and despair ! \

Chiron is officially my favorite character . With Lady Artemis and Huntress < PROPFEMALE > close seconds .

So now I'm in South < PROPFEMALE > , sitting in a hotel room at ( their time ) 2 in the morning . I'm gonna try and get some sleep , but just thought some people would like to know I made it safe and sound . Love you guys . ^^\ 
I think I'm nervous ... 
Family Day went well . Now for Graduation . I'm laying on my hotel room bed waiting for Kat and < PROPFIRST > and Grammy to finish getting ready . I'm in a white dress that only comes down to my knees ( shut up , you freaks that know me well enough not to expect that ^^) and an awesome black jacket . \ 
Know something ? The nervousness is back . >.> 
Graduation was nice . Waking up next to my fiance was heaven . Having to leave him at < PROPMALE > today or tomorrow ? Worse than anything hell could throw at me . 
Can my life explode with emotion any more than it is right now ?! \ 
Wait ... don't answer that . I know it could . And none of it would be good .

put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was \

you should repost to show your support of Dumbledore's Army !

Hey guess what you lost the game . >> 
Sometimes I wonder where I'll be in a day , a week , a month , a year . How much will my life change tomorrow ? In seven tomorrows ? 30 ? 365 ? 
Not all those who wander are lost ... 
They\ 
joined for many reasons , to march , to sail , to fly , \ 
They went where \ 
they were posted but nobody joins to die . \ 
Their leaders talk on TV what \ 
else could we have done ? \ 
But those leaders lost no daughters and none \ 
has lost a son . \ 
So here's to all our soldiers wherever they may \ 
be .... \ 
And here's to all their families , I raise a glass to thee ...

My fiance's coming home tomorrow or Thursday . Goddess , bless , I'm twitchy . Thought I was nervous when I was in < PROPFEMALE > ? Got nothing on this ! 
My day is long , my night is lonely . I struggle to sleep , and sometimes I can't eat . But my love is like a bridge that keeps me close to you so that I can keep going . Thank you , my Soldier . I love you . Come back to me soon . 
The Army has my Soldier , but I have his heart . <3 \

This is for the sad Army wives , the angry Army wives and the strong Army wives . A toast to you for falling apart and putting yourselves back together . Because a paycheck isn't enough , a body pillow in your bed is no consolation and a webcam can never compare .

I don't miss you and you alone - I miss you and me together . 
To fall asleep in the arms of a lover is paradise . To fall asleep in the arms of the one you love is heaven . To wake up in the arms of the one who is both ... there just isn't a word . 
Is another < PROPMALE > enough reason ? It has to be . 
I can be patient . You taught me that . So now I'll wait for you ... and live my life away from you , and never doubt that you have always been the best part of my life . 
I am 20 years old today ... and the one thing I want for today I probably won't get . At any rate , thank you , everyone who has wished me happy birthday today . each and every one of you has made me smile ... and I've needed it .

Why does such a pretty color have to be such a bad thing ? 
I'm tired of being broken , but I'm scared of being healed ... I usually just end up broken again . 
I was broken as a child . A young man came and mended me . Then I left him for one who healed me -- no glue required . I broke his heart , and he shattered me . And now I'm being healed again .... and it terrifies me . 
Back to school after a day and a half away due to snow ... and all I can see are the eyes I've been watching these last few weeks ... they're everywhere I look ... 
Sunshine and snow flurries . Stay flurries , dammit .

Some things are just shadows in the mist , and some things are as solid as a fist . Why do the things that hurt have be tangible , and the things that bring happiness be fleeting ? 
All of us have thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , find a new job , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this . 
To my girls , who make me smile every time I see your names . To my boys , who make me laugh . And to those who's mention makes me cry . I love you all . Don't go anywhere ... I wouldn't be me without you . 
really has to start remembering that the world rights itself in the end . <3 
I have DID . Crazy as fuck and proud of it ! 
I'm thinking of cutting my hair . At the moment , it comes just past my shoulders . I'm thinking of chopping it off to an inch or three long . You know , spiking length . Opinions ?
