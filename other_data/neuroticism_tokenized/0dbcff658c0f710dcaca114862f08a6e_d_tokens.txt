I had already quit my other job because RT 7 DINER hired me & was working out a schedule told me what to wear & everything told me to call sunday & now they say they hired someone because they needed someone friday when i was at the wedding which she said was fine when she hired me . people r messed up !

Thank you for everyones help we found an apt . Its gorgeous but we are paying for the beauty . < PROPFIRST > got into Schenectady christian very excited . We moved this weekend his room is done one down 5 more to go . I hate moving . Our room is the entire upstairs with a half bath and a huge walk in closet for me and a seperate one for < PROPFIRST > woo hoo . 
life is going ok these days my new apartment is way overpriced for what we got so i am pretty pissed about that there are so many things either unfinished or done horribly and my landlords wont return calls so sweet it i have to move again i will die dev is in schdy christian so that makes me smile he likes it too which is better worth the cost and trust me large cost hope everyone else out there is doing well
