Sorry about the notification thing , my account went insane and started sending messages everywhere . 

got my schedule . Somehow the seniors all know about my website , which scares me . 
is growing a peach tree in his backyard .

9th Grade ! Let's do this ! 
8 mile run ... hour long ... no breaks ...

Look's like I've got the whole house to myself for the rest of the week ...

is partying with the XC team .

is making music for Broken : The Game . 
U.N. < PROPMALE > was her ? is awesome . 
saw new < PROPFEMALE > :P 
Heavy Rain + 5K Thanksgiving Run + Horrible Cramp + Giant Hill = Not Fun . 
is almost ready for the orchestraw concert . 
finally got power back . 
Orchestra concerts are the concoction of evil gremlins . 
Going away on a trip for a week , may be on periodically . Happy holidays to everyone ! 
On the road again ... ` 
Totes just played the 1812 Overture right as the clock hit midnight . At full volume . Outside . While fireworks were erupting around my house . 
It's funny how I can be dreading a run , then feeling horrible while on the run , and throwing up when I finish ... but strangely , I want to do it again . 
Not enough hours in the day , huh ? 
Avatar . Hoh boy . I uh ... I really dunno what to think at this point ; it was good . Real good . Quite an experience . On the good side , i loved the villains and the plot in general ; the whole symbolic biology of Pandora was believable , which is rare in such a sci-fi movie . But i just can't figure out how I feel about it . 
is trying to install the new mecha spore pack . It is becoming increasingly the most frustrating thing ever . 
Most people spend saturday nights hanging out with friends . I spend mine pre-ordering pokemon games . 
Finals : Completed , destroyed , obliterated , owned , and thoroughly destroyed . 
Finals : Completed , destroyed , obliterated , owned , and thoroughly finished . 
I knew the saints could do it ! 
Almost time for Bioshock 2 ... 
My god ... I may just actually understand the math for the test . 
I miss the days when being sick meant you got to stay home ... 
Computer's fixed , projects are almost done , and easter's coming . It's gonna be a good weekend . 
Spent almost an hour struggling with calculating triangle lengths , and I just got it . Awesome . 
5:53 mile . Yesh indeed . 
just lost the game . 
lost the math packet guide for Mr Ortenzo's , does anyone know what the problems are for the math review ? 
Off to Oregon ... 
Just started listening to Children of Bodom for the first time , and simultaneously having my face blown off . 
Portal gun- in half life 2 . This may be the best thing ever . 
Had to find something to do this summer , so I'm learning HTML . I can now code a fairly decent webpage in just Microsoft Notepad . Score ! 
Might have broken my toe , so XC practice tomarrow isn't looking too good . 
Why does it seem like facebook is sending friend requests to people ? I almost never request people , but i'm suddenly getting all these notifications that people accepted my requests . :/ 
AND SPAIN SCORES ! 
Okay , since everyone is doing it , \ 
Like this status and i'll post on your wall ... \ 
\ 
1 . What I like about you . \ 
2 . What I dislike , too . \ 
3 . First Impression , and an\ 
4 . Honest Confession . \ 
and , just for the heck of it , \ 
5 . What pokeyman I think you would be . 
I < PROPMALE>' like when it's cold , but if it's so hot I can't even fall asleep , I'd rather just be in antartica . 
Time for my weeklong summer orchestra camp ... oh boy . 
Aha ! The solo is mine ! 
Read in my older brother's yearbook middle school yearbook ( over a decade old ): \ 
\Practice warcraft this summer so I can have some competition . Call me sometime . \ " \ 
A very potter sequel ... my life is complete . 
Spark Notes + Mom that majored in english literature + nice summer day with a book out on the porch = Wuthering Heights is making a lot more sense . 
Never use a preposition to end a sentence with . 
Like this status and Cthulhu will tell you your alignment ( lawful evil , neutral good , etc ) and a short blurb about you from his opinion . I am not being brainwashed by him to write this . Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn . Cthulhu fhtagn . 
My mom , while quilting , cut her finger almost completely off w/ a rotary blade . She then proceeded to drive herself to the hospital , get four stitches , drive back , replace the bandage and sterilize the stitches herself ... and then returned to quilting . With the blade . \ 
Boss . 
It's really weird learning that your teachers have facebooks . 
Speech and Debate is a lot like running in track . It's painful at first , but you learn to love the pain . Now I just need something in the fall to torture myself with . 
Sorry I haven't been around . I'm in Idaho . Yeaaah ... 
The one day that some crazy sonic boom takes place back home , I happen to be stuck in Oregon . Oh well , the < PROPMALE > bakery made up for it . Several times over . 
Summer homework ... finished . Brain ... thoroughly melted . 
World History , Vanderpol\ 
English Lit , Gollegly\ 
Orchestra , < PROPMALE > \ 
PreCal , Grotzke\ 
Chemistry , Blake\ 
Spanish , Wren\ 
Debate , Gorne\ 
Any of you guys know what these teachers are like ? I only have Gollegly and < PROPMALE > from last year . 
So I reinstall Warcraft III Reign of Chaos out of nostalgia to play some of the old maps . I play some campaign mode , and then decide to resume working on my RPG project . I open the folder to find ... the re-instillation has wiped my old files . My projects . My Frozen Throne maps . \ 
>:( 
Am I the only one that doesn't use a locker ? I always thought they waste more time than they < PROPMALE > . 
No joke , I saw a double rainbow a few hours ago . It was so intense . 
Rain , how I've missed you . 
A quick study tip for anyone taking a language class ( spanish , french , < PROPMALE > , etc . ) that I learned ; set your language on facebook to that language . Names and posts will still be in english , but you'll get a little bit of practice by reading your language all over the < PROPFEMALE > . It's actually fairly helpful at sustaining your skills if you don't feel like getting your books and notes out . Like me . 
And thus , summer comes to an end . Adeu , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ugh ... running on saturdays is not what I had in mind for XC . I guess breaking 5 minutes on my mile would be nice though . 
I understand that you want to burn a Quran because it bothers you , and the constitution allows for stupid , hateful things like that because that's how our country has to function in order for everyone to have freedom of expression . \ 
What I don't understand is why you have to do it on the day that so many families lost husbands and wives , many of whom are Muslim themselves . It's bringing disrespect to a new level . 
Saturday morning , first week of school over . Sleeping in , right ? \ 
Hah , I'd rather run through a lake up to my hips any day . XC FTW >:D 
Seaside = eating icecream on the beach while everyone else is in Pre-cal = XC is awesome . 
Seaside was fun ... and then I got the hard course . I think going through the mudpit was the best part of the race . 
Guys , \ 
if you get a message asking what you did in some video or whatever , \ 
it's not legitimate . Don't click on the links or you might get a virus , \ 
or something like that . If you notice that your account has been \

The hunger games series was ridic . 
Fatal disease is actually a really good song . 
Money is the root of all evil . \ 
Dig ! Dig ! Dig ! 
New Bioshock coming out , and I can't even get the second one to run on my computer . This is interesting . 
I like it on a frigid icy wasteland planet inhabited by a race of diminutive snow weasels who have constructed an elaborate tunnel system in the ice spanning thousands of < PROPMALE > . 
You call that breaking my spine ?! You Red Team ladies wouldn't know how to break a spine if ( crack ) OH MY SPIIIIIIIIINE 
I love nerd day in spirit week , because I don't need to dress up at all . \ 
Ohohoho . 
Like this status and I'll tell you what video game character I think you are . 
Maybe for ugly sweater day , I should wear something from WSU . 
Today's meet was so intense . FWXC SCRUBS FTW . 
Pasta party was teh awesome . Thanks guys for making it a great night , tomorrow's gonna be the best meet yet ! 
I think I'm finally starting to understand what Cambridge is all about ... working on two debate cases , precal pages , taking notes on English literature , doing huge packets of chemistry on molecular bonding , all on a Saturday night ... and loving every minute of it . 
loves actually getting homework done . 
Time to continue the long tradition of buying < PROPFEMALE > in the vain hopes that some kids may come to our house for Halloween , and then ending up eating all of it ourselves . 
Nanowrimo : 120 words so far . \ 
I guess we have to start somewhere . 
Interesting thoughts on a Like < PROPFEMALE > that has almost 400,000 likes . \ 
\BOYFRIEND GUIDE (: \ 
So apparently my judge for round 6 yesterday decided to change their vote on my ballot , making my record 2-4 instead of a 3-3 ... Debate is very interesting . 
AC . Less do diss ... 
2-4 at whitman to 4-2 at snohomish . IMPROVEMENT FTW . \ 
Also , congratulations to < PROPMALE > on getting his first lady friend . It's now 65 to 1 . 
Wonderboy ... what is the secret of your power ... 
I swear , if I have to right < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > one more time ...

Reasons I like debate :\ 
Other people there who play minecraft , half life , etc . \ 
People who actually know internet memes . \ 
Winning . \ 
Reasons I dislike debate :\ 
I miss weekends ;( \ 
5 hours of sleep . \ 
Losing . 
What the crap , every one is getting snow but me . ;_; 
Mr. < PROPFIRST > in class today , after looking at a solution of NaCl contemplatively :\ 
\We're gonna cook the hell out of this ! \ " \ 
Time to start running again . 5 minute < PROPMALE > won't break themselves . 
Ugh ... 50 minute redondo runs sure are a fun way to spend thanksgiving weekend . 
< PROPMALE > Potter , < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim , and Inception , all in one weekend ... 
I hate when I'm trying to make that one jump in a game that my character can just barely land , and in the middle of it , a wave of lag hits and I fail outstandingly . 
Time to lucid dream , so I can study for the chem test in my dreams ... 
NC , AC ... XC . 
It's over ... the chemistry test ... is finally over ... 
Always , I wanna be with you , and make believe with you , and live in < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > ... 
You know the drill . Since it's Pokemon picture month , like this status and I'll tell you what Pokemon you are . 
Why not , i'll do that number thing too . Send a message to mah inbox w/ a number and i'll make a post . Tomorrow morning . 
#69 ( lol ): You're one of the coolest people I know , and I'm not just saying that as a cop out . You always say hi to me , and are one of the people who understands me and the kinda stuff cambridge does to us . You're just a cool kid . 
7777777777757777777777 : What a bamf . Seriously , before this year I barely knew you and now you're like one of the awesomest people I know . You always say hilarious stuff and you happen to be awesome at a certain facebook game > : X 
768244762and a bunch of other numbers : Ever since elementary school you've been coolio . I remember those sweet bike races we had ... and how I lost all of them , lol . But srsly , you're just an energetic and nice guy , and you've always been a bro . 
1337 : is what you are . One of the few other h4ck0rz that I know . Sucks you ddin't go to fed , bro , but whatever . I also admire your flash skills . 
should have the rest of those number things done soon , been so fricken busy >.< 
minecraft . :] 
I've forgotten how good a warm bath feels after a long 70 minute run in the cold rain ... ahhhhh 
Hey people who were at the speech party : who left the capri sun , so I know who to bring it to after break ? 
7 . 
6 . 
Man , Black Swan was a weird friggin ' movie . Did not expect that much blood , but it was awesome in the end . 
Finally finishing these ... \ 
99.9999999999 ... \ 
Awesome runner , chill dude , fun to < PROPFEMALE > with . Can't wait to train w/ you , Isaah , and the rest of the crew for track . Just an all-round great guy . 
00000000000000001\ 
There's not enough space in this status to say all there is about you . You always have a way to make things better , even if I don't want them to . You're one of the best friends i've had . Sometimes I wish I was nicer to you , because I feel like I was an a-hole . 
01134\ 
You're probably the nicest person I know . Especially the little things , like saying hi when we pass in the halls . Helps brighten bad days sometimes . You're always very appreciative and nice , and It will be not awesome next year when you and all the other seniors move on . :/ 
Awesome yield this year >:D 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone . I love you . 
One last one that slipped under the rader :\ 
3.1415 ... \ 
You're my favorite person in the whole world . Minus your political views . 
Okay , I've seen a LOT of people falling for this ... so i'd like to take a minute to put this message out there :\ 
There is no app that can check who has seen your profile . Nothing . The closest you will get is some firefox addon that lets you and your friends see views to eachother , but there is no way to have it one-sided ; you can't check up on views to your profile . 
So , just saw Inception , two thoughts ;\ 
First , what if that whole movie ... was just part of the matrix ? \ 
And second , how insane would that movie have been if directed by < PROPMALE > Tarantino ? 
Far over the < PROPFEMALE > mountains cold\ 
To dungeons deep and caverns old\ 
We must away ere break of day\ 
To seek the pale enchanted gold . 
So , just wondering , but why do the titans never actually clash in Clash of The Titans ? It's all just titans clashing with humans ... 
So , I have an idea . I remember reading that if you listen to a song that you dislike for long enough , it'll start to grow on you , and you'll eventually end up enjoying it . So ... what if I listened to \Baby\ " by < PROPFIRST > Bieber every day for the rest of January ? " 
True joy is beating the champion with one pokemon left that has 10 hit points left and is confused . 
Ahh , debate tournaments ... 
masquetang > emillion 
Well , didn't take first place but being a finalist is plenty enough . For now . 
Well , it's taken all night and half my brain cells , but I do believe this English project is complete . 
Finally finished the hobbit . 
Snow is like your friend from out of town . He comes over unannounced and plops down on your couch , preventing you from leaving or getting anything done by refusing to let you do anything but make chicken noodle soup and play video games . He always stays for a week and then has to go back up to his family in Minnesota . But for some reason , even though he makes a mess of things , you still miss the fun you had with him . 
Extemp prep , blarg . 
How to determine how awesome a track event is :\ 
Start with the mile , which is the best and perfectly spaced event . Every time you cut that distance in half or double it ( 800 , 2 mile , etc . ) you go down a level of awesome . So 800's and 2 < PROPMALE > are fairly awesome , and 400's are moderately awesome , etc . etc . 
Futbol > Football 
Okay . There will be a dance at my school . One of the people from Jersey Shore will be there . My reserve of snowballs from last winter and cream pies is still in high supply . With the right seat and a few calculations , I could figure out the trajectory it would take to throw one of these to hit a theoretical target at the dance floor . With a minion , I could organize an escape plan through one of the back doors . \

Stranger : Asl\ 
You : 10 / m / pallet town\ 
Your conversational partner has disconnected . 
60 minutes * 8 hours * 180 days in a school year * 10.5 years = 907200 minutes spent in school . \ 
Almost hit one million ! Huzzah ...? 
Time to actually continue and possibly finish my trans-medieval steam-punk novel ? Why , I think yes . Ghàele Ilmària , mortals . 
Ms. G's English class , also known as advisory #2 . 
Spent a solid 5 hours napping today . Congrats FWHS Speech & Debate . I am exhausted . 
1st person to comment my status- I will have your last name for a week . \ 
2nd person to comment my status- You can dare me to do one thing . \ 
3rd person to comment my status- I'll write I love you on your wall . \ 
4th person to comment my status- I will answer any question .. for you . \ 
Put this as your status ... if you're brave 
Thank you to the Ong Family (& Cousins ) for making me laugh the hardest I have ever in my life . 
Okay . Last one of these I'm doing for a while . Like this and I'll tell you what fantasy-esque race you would be ; ork , goblin , elf , etc . Nothing too far out there , mostly just Tolkien races , so you'll be able to Google if if you've never heard of it . I will also let you know what class you would be ; once again , same deal , basic stuff like warrior , mage , priest , etc . 
Long nap , quick run , spend the rest of the night listening to the LotR soundtrack ... life is good . 
Now , to ACTUALLY learn how to program and not just GUI everything . 
Just saw Shawshank Redemption for the first time ... what an amazing movie . 
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn .

Oh jeez , all these birthday messages ... thank you guys so much , I can barely keep up ! 
Homework : Write an essay about the various types of medieval weapons used in the early 20th century , such as swords or axes . Dissect some of your favorites , and explain why . \ 
English homework is a lot more fun when you get to write up your own thesis for essays . 
so ... have to create an entire archive of files for extemp by tomorrow ... fun fun fun . 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYq_-zju_P8&NR=1 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and Long Distance . You know we be LD'n all day , err day . 
According to Twilight , vampires are at their strongest just after transformation because they still have human blood lingering in them . As time goes on , this blood is lost and they lose power . So human blood makes them stronger ... why aren't humans already much more powerful than them ? in fact , why would you even want to become a vampire ? 
ugh ... history 
Caught a wild Pansage ... YES 
Last speech tournament ( for me ) of the year . Still thinking about whether it's a good idea to do an entire impromptu in song . 
Total number of people at speech tournaments i've met who .. \ 
play minecraft : about 40\ 
play pokemon : 7\ 
play audiosurf : 3\ 
play fable : 3\ 
< PROPFIRST > the \trollololol\ " song super loud in the middle of a field : 1\ 
State reading test tomorrow + 4 hours to do it + only non-electronics allowed after the test = I'm finishing lord of the rings this week 
Epic rap session w/ Koby < PROPMALE > today . 
I love that moment when I finally understand everything in math ... 
sin(math ) / cos(test ) = tan(finally done ) 
HAHAHahahAhahaha ... \ 
\Friday\ " is seriously one of the funniest songs i've ever heard . It's hilariously bad . " 
warm < PROPFEMALE > day + slow , melodic beatles songs + nothing to do = good day so far 
ugh ... days when I feel like I accomplished nothing are really annoying . 
Okay , so I'm thinking of writing a play based on the periodic table ... Mr. < PROPFIRST > gave me the inspiration with the \Fl + NaCl --> NaFl + Cl\ " explanation . \ 
it could snow tonight , right ? ... right ? 
It's spirit day for my school today . \ 
So , I'm wearing all black . 
time to run in the rain ... just one more minute of facebook 
Just saw a house that was a castle . I'm not kidding ; it had ramparts , a gate , and towers all over it . Soooo awesome ...
