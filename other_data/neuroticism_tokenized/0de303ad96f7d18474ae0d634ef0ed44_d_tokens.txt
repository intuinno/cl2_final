The status drama is hilarious . hahahaha 
Are the back roads well enough for travel ? 
POL was pretty fun today .... even if we didn't get free cookies .

Proverbs 4:18 
Romans 8:29 -30 : For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .

1 < PROPFIRST > 5:8 ( English Standard Version)\

Be sober-minded ; be watchful . Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour . 
It's almost spring time ! It's time to shave the eyebrows . 
Youth went well . I hope someone took something out of that . 
Wording of your OPs can spark serious unintended offense . Ah !! 
House is back on drugs . :) 
God’s Sovereign Choice : Read Romans 9 . 
Every right-minded man has a philosophy of life , whether he knows it or not . Hidden away in his mind are certain governing principles , whether he formulates them in words or not , which govern his life . Surely his ideal ought to be to contribute all that he can , however little it may be , whether of money or service , to human progress . \ 
-- < PROPFIRST > D . Rockefeller 
What's your favorite book in the Bible ? 
I can't believe that happened .

Evolution makes us a miracle .

\A fire broke out backstage in a theater . The clown came out to warn the public ; they thought it was a joke and applauded . He repeated it ; the acclaim was even greater . I think that's just how the world will come to an end : to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke . \ " ~ Søren Kierkegaard "

Doctor Who is back and it's actually interesting again . Well done Moffat . 
I find it hilarious to like God on Facebook . 
It isn't racist to have no interest in foreign cultures . 
Ever heard of Absinthe ? Beer has 4-6% ABV ( alcohol by volume ) on average . Absinthe has between 45%-75% ABV on average . Anyone want to try it ? 
Who the hell kills Turtles for fun ? The assholes of Devan Crook and < PROPMALE > Fidler . :) 
< PROPMALE > Rocks . 
Rorschach : You see , Doctor , God didn't kill that little girl . Fate didn't butcher her and < PROPFEMALE > didn't feed her to those dogs . If God saw what any of us did that night he didn't seem to mind . From then on I knew ... God doesn't make the world this way . We do .

There is a fifth dimension , beyond that which is known to man . It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity . It is the middle ground between light and shadow , between science and superstition , and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge . This is the dimension of imagination . It is an area which we call The Twilight Zone . —Rod Serling 
Are you a Democrat or a Republican ? Neither . I'm a bull moose ! 
We are not human beings having a spiritual experience . We are spiritual beings having a human experience . - < PROPMALE > Teilhard de Chardin 
“Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing wonder and awe - the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me . ” ~ Immanuel Kant 
It's times like these when I wonder how stupid some people are . 
Facebook loves to taunt me . 
I want to be a radio host . Giving advice to lovers and playing passionate music all night long . My voice is here to comfort you . My strong hands and powerful presence let you know I'm in control . That's the power of < PROPMALE > ! 
Hell is worth the attractive guy from Las Vegas ? Wait ... What the ...? 
I'm queer but you're here . Well done , worthy adversary ! o_o 
Shrimp for dinner tonight ! Woot , Woot ! 
I may be critical but I'm actually a bleeding-heart optimist . Just saying .... 
I love this new chat function . 
Am I too serious or too laid back ? 
I hate < PROPMALE > Flanders . 
I just realized that I have to deal with another English class in just a month . :( 
The fiddle is awesome . 
\Read my lips . No new taxes . \ " FAIL "

Truth is ... my little pony is awesome . 
Going to see < PROPMALE > Potter tonight . 
Severus Snape is the best HP character ever . 
Whoa , since when is there a creative writing class ? 
\Extremism in the defense of < PROPFEMALE > is no vice . And moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue . \ " ~ < PROPMALE > Goldwater " 
I need a prolonged distraction . 
They need to make a movie about the life and times of Albus Dumbledore . It probably won't happen given that he was gay and presenting that part of his character on the big screen will make the homophobic idiots riot .... at least in this country . But come on , that would be such an amazing film to watch ! 
How can anyone feel refreshed by something so relentlessly tedious and predictable ? There is no joy or fun when all you have is fear . When your actions are devoid of compassion , you become a monster . You create a hell on earth where only delusions of heaven can keep you sane . You devour anything that conflicts with your arrogant perceptions of humility . It is a curse , not salvation . 
Torchwood is fantastic . 
BAH ! ZINT . Ohto Noko . 
Wow , the end of summer is upon us and I have never been so bored . There seems to be nothing worth living for now .... Wait , what did you say ? Shark Week starts July 31st at 9PM ? O_O FANTASTIC ! The spring of life is flowing again !! 
If your soul was exposed everyday on your face , would you wear a mask ? 
I'm a married man now . I understand that most of you were holding out for my love . I'm afraid you'll just have find another fish . 
Why do I keep smoking cigars in my dreams ? 
When I picture getting into fights at school , it always seems to be myself vs Lord Voldemort . Is this normal ? 
Eternal hell makes me sad . 
Don't be like me . When you idealize your love all you feel is pain . When you make an image out of sadness , you will never be normal . Human emotions are not something you should toy with . They are far more powerful than any deity you can imagine . 
Shark Week starts at 8 tonight . Enjoying two hours of awesome sharky goodness . 
Never understood why we have to suffer through world history . Martians are much more interesting than humans . 
Man , I love Facebook . Even though I'm not close friends with all the people I have on here . Your lives are bloody entertaining . Keep being human folks . 
Is class registration really this week ? O_O 
Ugh , all hail the super congress . :( 
ERRR , I BELIEVE IN THINGS .... ERRR POST THIS AS YUOR STATUS IF YUO HAVE THERE GUTSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!! 1111 . <<<< O_O No . 
I'm going to rant about the military . 
< PROPFIRST > McCartney was the best beatle . O_O I said it . 
Boring day ... 
Horrible night ... this day isn't much better . 
This summer was absolutely horrible . I would prefer the taste of a bullet to this nonsense . I'm so glad school is starting . How can people be so horrible to each other ? :( 
100% Man and 100% God .... How come nobody knows what that means ? Milk is lame , bring the meat . 
This country is going up in flames . We need serious help . 
This day was awesome . :D 
What a day ... 
\A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them . \ " ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > " 
Decent first two days with a little bit of homework . All is well in my small little world . 
This year will have a lot of controversies . I'm politically and religiously to the left of every bloody person in this town . This is going to be fun ! 
Yikes , that was a horrible nightmare . Let's hope it doesn't become a reality . 
Wow , what's with all the inspirational Facebook updates ? The mush is making my heart thaw out . 
Monday sucks . 
Television doesn't work for me anymore . I actually prefer school work . 
Ugh . This is such a boring night ... 
Teasing me Facebook ... I'll strike you down . You have my word . O_O 
Fright Night looks amazing . Finally a real vampire movie ! 
That was absolute nonsense . 
Facebook sucks . I think I might just shut it down . The conversations aren't good anymore . I have few friends to talk to when I'm on . No one pays attentions to my posts anyway . 
The Secret of NIMH is my new favorite animated film . 
When a character in a book makes you angry enough to punch the wall , you know that the author of said book is a genius . 
This wasn't a very fun Saturday . 
There isn't a thing on TV . All music does to you is break you . I have no one to talk with . I'm surprised I have any blood left in my veins . I'm going to go read . Let's hope that reading hasn't lost its taste either . 
I want to wrestle a grizzly bear . 
It finally happened . I've lost my taste for reading . I hope it's just the book . 
The chemistry book is a really bad math guide . 
Guy love is great and all but Facebook is so boring sometimes . I was having five hour conversations a few months ago . Now , almost everyone is busy . 
I don't really like four day weekends . O_O 
The school has anti-weed propaganda on the table by the Counselors office . This school is declining every day . Too much Republican Jesus , not enough common sense . 
I have a cold and it sucks . 
Ugh , even when school is out Mondays still suck . 
This statement is false . 
Ugh , this day was lame . There were only two redeeming factors . 
O_O I hate Saturdays . 
Human beings , even in conflict , always do what they believe is correct . Truly wonderful , even heart breaking . 
I have a weird feeling . 
Ah , this was a good night . No one to talk to though and I'm finally in the chatting mood . Oh , well . 
< PROPFEMALE > D is the nectar of life . 
My mother is drunk . This is hilarious . 
Reality kind of sucks . O_O 
Same-sex marriage . 
The American justice system has failed us tonight . 
Romney came out looking strong . The last part of the debate did elevate my mood from the negatives digits . 
Fun night . :) 
This weekend rates a 9/10 on the < PROPMALE > scale . Which is just so great . 
Hmm , I'm frustrated and easily annoyed . Not sure why .... 
I'm not tired tonight . I took a nap . :) 
Cee-Lo Green is awesome .
