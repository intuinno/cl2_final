psalms 18:1 -3\ 
\ 
1 . I will love thee , O LORD , my strength . \ 
2 . The LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower . \ 
3 . I will call upon the LORD , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies 
psalms 3:8 \ 
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD : thy blessing is upon thy people . 
Ecclesiastes 3:11 -13\ 
11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end . \ 
12 I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life . \ 
13 And also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of God . 
Wake up in the mornin wit one thought , I gotta get it . Then I hopped up in the shower my gurl already in it .... \ 
Hopped out the shower soakin wet , I'm already fly n I aint even put < PROPFEMALE > clothes on yet , cause they get fly and I am fly ... 
so when a teacher doesnt really give lectures , doesnt teach 80% of the material in the book , and allows open book tests , even on the final wtf is she teaching ? i feel like this class is really wasting my time can i have the final now n skip the rest of dumb shit 
so when u loose not one but both axles on ur car in 30 days wut do u do ? then u get not one but 4 flats in a matter of 1 month , ur goin to school and the fuel pump goes out , another day ur tirods go , battery dies jus cause , hub assembly yup thats been done . brakes check them off the list of shit thats gone wrong too , not once but twice and now the caliper is goin bad too ...... 
all that fixed , now i got to leave for class n the engine head jus cracked .... all this since the end of january .... all i wanna do is get this damn degree and somebody or somethin dont want me finish this shit is crazy .......... damn man 
When you come to the edge of all the light you know , and are about to step off into the darkness of the unknown , faith is knowing one of two things will happen : There will be something solid to stand on , or you will be taught how to fly . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > J . Winter 
If you don't go after what you want , you'll never have it . If you don't ask , the answer is always no . If you don't step forward , you're always in the same place . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Roberts 
“Do not go where the path may lead ; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail”\ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Emerson\ 
“I am a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down ... ”\

“Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life ... as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed . ”\

\We are all in the gutter 
\One day your life will flash before your eyes . Make sure its worth watching . \ " \ 
\This is what the LORD says : \ " Maintain justice and do what is right 
Knowledge can be communicated , but wisdom cannot . A man can find it , he can live it , he can be filled and sustained by it , but he cannot utter or teach it . \ 
Hermann Hesse 
You can't always see things for what it is if you just stare at it , sometimes you have to step back , look at things from a different perspective and ask questions . \ 
< PROPMALE > Ruiz \ 
Ignorance is a characteristic amongst many , while wisdom is a virtue to few . \ 
Lucid Poet 
Do more than belong : participate . Do more than care : help . Do more than believe : practice . Do more than be fair : be kind . Do more than forgive : forget . Do more than dream : work . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Every morning you are handed 24 < PROPFEMALE > hours . They are one of the few things in this world that you get free of charge . If you had all the money in the world , you couldn't buy an extra hour . What will you do with this priceless treasure ? Remember , you must use it , as it is given only once . Once wasted you cannot get it back . 
Wisdom is your perspective on life , your sense of balance , your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other . It embraces judgment , discernment , comprehension . It is a gestalt or oneness , and integrated wholeness . \ 
< PROPFIRST > R . Covey 
< PROPFEMALE > with others is Love , < PROPFEMALE > with self is Hope , < PROPFEMALE > with God is Faith . \ 
Adel Bestavros \ 
Be wise to insure that every idle word spoken is carried with peace , driven with love , and filled with hope . For this we know is certain , one day our words will become our last . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > \ 
A life without cause is a life without effect\ 
Barbarella 
omg i dont think im ever gonna get this paper to sound the way i want it too , its givin me the worst headache 
dont let someone be a priority in your life when u are still an option in their life\ 
God didn't promise days without pain , laughter without sorrow , sun without rain , but He did promise strength for the day , comfort for the tears , and light for the way . \ 
Fate , is an excuse for why we end up where we do ! Our ' Actions ' predetermine our < PROPFEMALE > , our ' Reactions ' seal that fate ! 
Some people come into our lives and quickly go . Others stay awhile , make footprints on our hearts and we are never , ever the same . \ 
To attract good fortune , spend a new coin on an old friend , share an old pleasure with a new friend , and lift up the heart of a true friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon . \ 
Chinese Proverb 
By all means marry . If you get a good wife you will become happy , and if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher . Socrates ( 470-399 B . C . )\ 
Life is uncharted territory . It reveals its story one moment at a time . \

all that worrying an stressin bout the final in my class is for not , my instructor jus told me i got the highest grade , now that is wuts up !!!! I am excited bout that !! 
\I had the blues because I had no shoes until upon the street 
\Fall seven times and stand up eight . \ " \ 
A real act of honesty is not enough to be honored by everyone , but being witnessed by you and God alone . \ 
As the rest of the world is walking out the door , your best friend's are the ones walking in . \ 
Neither genius , fame , nor love show the greatness of the soul . Only kindness can do that . 
' Success , remember is the reward of toil . \\ 
So if < PROPFIRST > clausen who all ya'll n.d. fans claimed was heisman worthy last year couldnt beat Big Blue , how can u expect < PROPMALE > Crist(who is this kid anywayz ) to get it done ? \
