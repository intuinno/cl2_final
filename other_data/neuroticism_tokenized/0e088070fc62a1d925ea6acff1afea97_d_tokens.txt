My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease ; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE ........ 93% of people won't copy and paste this , WILL YOU be one of the 7% that does ............... and make this your status for at least an hour ? 
< PROPFEMALE > is a virtue 
waiting on Savannah ... nothing today , maybe tomorrow 
Will be at the doctor's this afternoon to see how much I'm dialated ... wish me luck 
Poopy , only 1.5 cm ! 
Almost officially past my due date 
The countdown begins ... 1 day overdue 
What was the #1 song on the day you were born ? Google the date and #1 billboard song .... Copy and paste with your #1 song . Mine is : The Four Seasons , Oh what a night ... in 1976 R U kidding me , if I were born a month earlier , it would have been < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s 50 ways to leave your lover , a couple months later and I would have been born to Afternoon Delight ! 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments . 
4 days overdue ... come out < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Thank you all for your congrats and well wishes . I have posted some pictures , and am quite tired , so I won't be on facebook nearly as often as I used to . 
I can't believe my daughter is one month old today ! 
My daughter attended her first Mass last night , and behaved like an angel :) She was as quiet as a church mouse ! 
It amazes me that some people lose their health to make money , then lose their money to restore their health . We shouldn't work ourselves to death ... some things in life , like family , are more important ! 
I wish we could be born old and then get young . 
Thank you all for your birthday wishes ! I already received the best gift ever ... my baby < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Here Comes the Sun ! 
When you find Peace within yourself , you can live at Peace with others . 
In farmville I'm in need of : 4 paned windows , 3 aged bricks , 2 turtledoves and a partridge in a pear tree ! :) 
I had a dream last night that I died , and yes , I am still alive to talk about it . 
WHOA !!! I never knew so much poop could come out of such a little girl ... we had a < PROPMALE > blow out ! 
It's Friday night , and I'm looking forward to going to bed early ... how pathetic , but I'm so darn tired ! 
I had planned on cleaning the house today , but it's so nice out , and the dust and cat hair will still be there tonight ! 
Oh no , the chicken my husband took out for dinner has not thawed out , now we're ordering chinese food ... YUMMY !!! 
Off to bring < PROPFEMALE > to see Grandma and Grandpa !!! Over the river and through the woods to Cranston we go ! 
In pursuing personal happiness , one must bring happiness to others 
Anyone want to adopt two cats ? One likes to poop on the floor , while the other pukes on it !.... I mean they're really great cats - they never cause any problems 
Enjoys changing the lyrics of songs based on what < PROPFEMALE > is doing . For instance instead of Who shot the monkey , we sing Who dropped the binky , followed by Tootin ' < PROPFEMALE > , which is a twist on Rockin ' < PROPFIRST > 
It really is a Good Friday , warm , < PROPFEMALE > , and very thankful for what the Lord has blessed me with , and the ultimate sacrifice He made for us ! 
Actually got a good nights sleep last night :) 
My baby girl is 9 weeks old today ! 
Tomorrow < PROPFEMALE > gets baptised :) 
Back to work this Thursday . Boy 10 weeks flew by ! 
I think I aged myself yesterday when talking about the Banana Splits , and my coworkers had no idea what I was taslking about . I still have the song stuck in my head ... tra la la la la la la , tra la la la la la la la :) 
Playing catch up at work ! So much to do ... so little time ! 
To all my St. < PROPFIRST>'s friends : Who's going to the reunion ? 
I traded eyeliner for dark circles , Salon hair cuts for pony tails , my figure for stretch marks , designer jeans for sweat pants , long showers for hairy legs , late nights at the club for early mornings , designer purses for diaper bags , and I wouldn't change a thing to get it back !! I LOVE BEING A MOM !!... Re ... post this if you don't care what you gave up and will continue to give up for your kids ! 
Blah !!!! 
I like it on the kitchen table 
I finally get to celebrate Mother's Day ! Yeah :) 
Wishing all you mommies out there a happy Mother's Day ! I hope you all enjoyed it ! 
It's 10 pm on a Saturday night , and I'm headed for bed ... how pathetic ! But I'll be up at 3 am , then again at 6 am . I hope < PROPFEMALE > starts sleeping through the night soon . 
waiting ... 
Sad that my family isn't coming down from New Hampshire because my niece is sick :( \ 
I Hope you feel better < PROPFIRST > and we love you and miss you ! 
< PROPFEMALE > loves blowing spit bubbles so much that I am running out of bibs ! 
I wish I had a < PROPFEMALE > gardener ! 
sleepy , but too much to do - can't take a nap :( 
loves watching her daughter sleep ... the little angel 
Hates working Saturdays ... and for those of you wondering - I'm on my luch break ! 
done with playing games , time for Hell's Kitchen 
why do men feel it necessary to hold on to holy underwear ? do they think it's sacred ? 
that which doesn't break me , makes me stronger 
Funny to see how excited < PROPFEMALE > gets when our cat < PROPMALE > pays her a visit 
< PROPFEMALE>'s 6 month checkup went very well . 14 lbs , 12 oz ... still a little peanut , but as happy and precious as ever , even after her shots - 5 seconds of screaming and done 
Looking forward to a day of rest tomorrow . The Fall can't come fast enough . I think all my co-workers would agree . 
When it comes to my daughter < PROPFEMALE > , I didn't think I'd be such a softy , but apparently I am . 
Before you were conceived I wanted you . \ 
Before you were born I loved you . \ 
Before you were here an hour I would die for you . \ 
This is the miracle of life . - < PROPFEMALE > Hawkins 
Forget bibs , < PROPFEMALE > needs a poncho ! 
Children with special needs only want what we all want ... to be ACCEPTED !!!!!!!! Can I make a request of anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education week , and this in honor of all children who learn a little differently ! ? ? 
I can't belive my baby is a year old tomorrow ! Slow down time . SLOW DOWN ! 
Thank you all for your nice birthday wishes !
