Often asks himself why he does the things he does . Answer : Cause he’s a moron !!!! Why !!! Why do I keep doing this to myself !!!!!! Maybe I’m a Masochist . No I’m still a moron . 
So instead doing my evening work out I end up drinking 7 beers and eating 2 dinners one of them being chicken Lasagna and the other being a full rack of ribs . way to stay in shape . LOL 
After an extensive conversation with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > I found out she hates the word CUTE and anyone who uses it towards her . So please beware because she punched me in the stomach and spit on me .

So I’m going to work tomorrow .. I think something up , because it’s normally my day off . I can’t help but think that I’m going to get jumped when I go in . Maybe I should send the doppelganger instead :) : 0 
What can I say when a door close’s another one opens . When I woke up this morning I didn't think that I would be hopping on a plane to San < PROPFEMALE > . I’m sure friends and love ones will understand my disappearance for next couple of days while I go through my options . I would like to send my apologies to < PROPFEMALE > Beeman , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Seronio , < PROPFEMALE > Peterson , and < PROPMALE > Zabala Alipio I will be back Saturday

This is the biggest tease ever , so Reno is having an anime convention !! It’s the first one ever !!! So it’s going to suck , but that’s not the point . I have no camera and no money and it all goes down Friday and Saturday . DAMN IT !! Curse you fate !!!!! 
So it looks like my reign of terror is over . I official start work Saturday . tomorrow will be my last day of sitting around the house playing video games and eating delicious delicious sandwiches . Ahh memories . 
Dear world , I hate you . They tell me to vote in a place where I’m barely considered a citizen and I don’t take the time to learn the issues . So my question to you is what’s more dangerous an ignorant voter or an apathetic one ? I ask this because I fall into one of those categories . 
After hearing some unsettling news about panda’s I now HATE bears more than ever !!!!! Especially PANADA’S !!!!!!! 
So after watching MegaMind with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > I can't help but wonder what Evil heaven is like and if you have to be a Super villain to go there . :D
