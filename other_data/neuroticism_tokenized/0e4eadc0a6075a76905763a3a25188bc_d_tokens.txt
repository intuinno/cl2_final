Hi David/son , we are fine , and it is so nice to see your face on facebook !! You are so grown up and of course handsome . Hope all is well for you , I think we live near you now , we are in WV . Are you in VA ? 

< PROPFIRST > says Momma < PROPFIRST > and Baby Sullivan are doing Great ! 
Finally figured out how to edit and delete photos in album , now Sullivan's birth album should make more sense ! 
Just stopping in between Sully visits to see how everyone is doing . Miss everyone ! 
What animal are you ? -- My Result : Horse . http://quizme.heroku.com/quizzes/724977/referrals/status?aid=1814830217
