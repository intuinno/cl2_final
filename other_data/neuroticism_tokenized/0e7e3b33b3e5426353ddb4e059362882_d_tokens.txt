Just woke up from a 2 hour nap . Damn i needed that . :] now i'm bumping up the bass music . :D 
First day of work was cool . :] Have some stories already . lol . I'm ready to sleep now though . 
Just finished my physical . Man , first thing i say is \what ? \ " when i hear her say that . >.< Haha . " 
Well I think I screwed up . Blah . That's what I get for risking . But it's what I need to do . 
Today's work makes me wonder : what goes through a kids mind when you yell at them to step on the RED brake to stop , yet continue to floor the GREEN one . >.< lol . 
I did real good today in practice . :] i surprised myself . Now i'm thinking what i'll do before i go to work . Hmm .. 
I'm in san < PROPFIRST > . There's cops blocking the street . Why ? People are rioting . This place is too crazy . 
Did an open-top bus tour around san < PROPFIRST > . That was < PROPFEMALE > . Lol . Just finished eating pho . Good again . :] ( It's noodle soup ) 
Back from San < PROPFIRST > . It was cool but it's too suffocating over there . Just finished saying goodbye to < PROPMALE > after giving him a little firework show . Now time to get ready for paintballing tomorrow . :] 
Ugh . I just messed up my knee so bad . There goes running for a bit and probably work .

Just got an mri for my knee . I'm going to see the sports med tomorrow . Blah . I'll see what's up . 
Surgery anyone ? 
I'm bored . Ask away : http://www.formspring.me/danram09 
So 2-3 weeks before I have a surgery . At least I know I'll keep my job . :] I'm glad I'm doing better . :] 
Thinking that people will give you what you want without saying what you want will never get you what you want . 
I hate feeling held back ... my mind wanders too much now ... 
I just finished seeing a second doctor for my knee . I'm getting surgery this thursday now . 
I have to be over for surgery at 8:30 in the morning on thursday . At least it's not that much longer . 
You cannot fathom the immensity of the f *** I do not give . 
At the hospital now . Well time for surgery soon . 
I'm done with my surgery . It took like 3 hours . I can't believe how bad the pain was when i woke up . I'm so sleepy now . At least i'm going home now . 
I'm heading over to the doctor's to follow up on my knee . I'm going to probably see some stitches . Yummy . Lol . 
I'm finally able to do more things on my own . But walking is still off the list . On the other hand , I finally have my own car . :] 
Man , making my way around school with these crutches get me so tired . I'm so ready to knock out . I have to wake early tomorrow also . At least I'll see the team to see how they've been . 
Ugh . Why am i still having dreams about her ?! I hate having dreams like that . It's like a nightmare . 
Wish me luck that I have a dream-of-her-free night . So far it's been two nights in a row . Ugh . 
Drove my car for the first time today . :] ya it might have only been around the block , but I managed to get myself in by myself and everything . :] Man I have to do a lot of work on it though . 
If you could define me ( in a sentence or a word ) , what would you say ? Feel free to answer anyone . 
I'm finally scheduled to work , well for next sat . but still . I'm done with my first week of physical therapy now and school is not that bad so far . I'm also getting myself around now with my own car , I still have a lot of work to do with it though . Things are coming back now . 
Got to see a lot of familiar faces today . That was cool . All they got to see was my crippled self . lol . 
Good job today AVC cross country . You guys gave me a workout having to crutch around to cheer for all of you . lol . But i'm glad i went . :] 
Darn ps3 network , doing maintenance til 5 so i cant play online . Now all i can do is homework . lol . 
Good news pho lovers , there is a pho restaurant in palmdale . 
So after two hours of torture I got to fly my therapist's mini helictopter . lol . 
First day back to working today , I'm kinda nervous . lol . 
So no more crutches . But my walking is still messed up , it's like my leg has down syndrome . lol . 
Trying to kill time in school sucks . I have nothing to do for an hour . 
So I get my lab practical test back today , I got a 60/60 . I was so surprised . lol . But thank goodness . 
I saw my grade for Bio Lab , I have a 93% . The next highest in the class , 82% . And I'm at 102degrees flexion now . Progress is good . 
Hooray for me ... I have to get put under on Friday so I can get my knee manipulated ... and blah ... 
Got my manipulation today . Man i hate the feeling of waking up from being put under . Hopefully I'll get better from this . 
Does anyone still use this ? \

I feel like driving somewhere very far . 
Done with therapy ... for now . At least I get to go on a cruise tomorrow . 
Oh man , last night at work was the craziest !! Kids can cause so much mayhem . I lost my voice from yelling so much . 
My puppy is keeping me from doing my study guide , he's falling asleep on my lap . 
I seriously almost got ran over by a kid in a go kart . Weird thing is , he was the one with the dear in the headlights look . >.<* 
My puppy is back to his old self and I got a really good mountain bike today . :] Things are getting good . :] 
So I added my points together and added the last possible points to see what my grade could be if I half-assed my last exam tomorrow ... I would still get an A !!! Awesomeness . :D That's what i get for doing so good til now . 
What a night . :] 
There I go messing up . . . yet again . 
Thank you everyone for the happy birthdays . :] 
Thank you everyone again . :) so many b-days from all of you . ( I'm saying this from an iPad in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ) these are pretty bad ass . Lol . 
After 3 years and 2 months of having the same phone , I finally got myself a new one . :] that was my gift to myself . lol . 
I can't believe it took me 3 hours to get to UCLA . That's what i get for it being my first time driving out of palmdale on my own . Looks like I'm staying for the night too . :] Mini adventure . 
I am done with therapy !!! :D 
Over an hour long bike ride around Palmdale . That's what's up . :]

Who wants to go bike riding right now ? :] 
One paper down , three tests to go . Then spring break . 
One paper and two tests down now . Only one more test to go . 
Done with all my tests now . I think I did pretty good on all of them . Now I'm hanging out with tennis people at the park . 
54 minute bike ride followed by a 19 minute run then go out with my older brother to get a new puppy . What a day already . :]
