In the creative state a man is taken out of himself . \ 
He lets down as \ 
it were a bucket into his subconscious , and draws up something which is \ 
normally beyond his reach . He mixes this thing with his normal \ 
experiences and out of the mixture he makes a work of < PROPMALE > . 
Nothing \ 
contributes so much to tranquilize the mind as a steady \ 
purpose -- \ 
a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye . \

What we do \ 
in our dreams we also do when we are awake : we invent and make up the \ 
person we are dealing with—and immediately forget that we have done it . Friedrich Nietzsche ( 1844-1900 ) 
A \ 
man needs the sexual conquest to prove that he can still do \ 
it , that he can still get it up . It's like having a duel with \ 
himself . He has to prove it all the time . We don't have to prove \ 
it . \

Courage is the most important of all the virtues , \

We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry , \ 
naked and homeless . The poverty of being unwanted , unloved and uncared for \ 
is the greatest poverty . We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind \ 
of poverty . \

Most of the poverty and misery in the world is due to \ 
bad government , lack of democracy , weak states , internal strife , and so on . \

A Winter Limerick\

Success was just step away until something snags it right from under you leaving the < PROPFIRST > of regret for even trying . Why bother having the support of helping with getting a career started when the support decides to bail when it is needed at the most crucial time . To continue forward or just quit ? 
Passed Access and still kepted an ' A ' . Yeah ! 1 class down and 3 more to go .

Tonight < PROPFEMALE > is performing her < PROPMALE > bear dance at school and < PROPFEMALE > is to perform her hip hop dance at school tomorrow .

I am so happy for my new car . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > for the very early b-day gift (: Girls are driving me nuts . Everyday for the past week girls have been at each others heads over the tiniest things . It must be because they are not ready for their dad to leave yet . I know I am not but it has to be done for the best . 
Kids and I had a blast . We were in Colfax and it had just started to snow as we were heading closer to our auntie mama's house up towards the woods . Forgot how much fun it is to drive in the snow and get covered head to toe in the white stuff . HA HA had a blast . Maybe tomorrow the whole family can head up there for some snow day fun ; before Daddy leaves .

To my children , I make mistakes , sometimes more than I would like to admit , being a Mom . But I will always be there for you , to hear you , to cheer you , to laugh or cry with you , to protect you with my life , and to love you for eternity with all my heart !

To my husband ; I posted the videos of OUR Wonderful son . He is getting so big . Yes he loves to make a mess . 
I have tattoos , so I'm trashy & a trouble maker . I have curves , so I'm fat . If I wear makeup , I'm fake . If I say what I think , I'm a bitch . If I cry some times , I'm a drama < PROPFEMALE > . If I have guy friends , I'm a slut . If I stand up for myself , I'm mouthy . Seems like you can't do anything these days without being labeled . So , go ahead and label me baby , see if I care . Re-post this if you're proud of who you are !!
