Just bought a signed < PROPFEMALE > Rice edition of Feast Of All Saints . I'm so happy I could purr ... Now looking for a signed copy of Cry To Heaven . 

Hello , my name is < PROPFEMALE > . And I'm a Bingo addict . I confess that I go to Bingo with my mother 1-2 times a week . I come home with dauber stains on my fingers and my hands looking like tie-dye . And I love it ! AND I won $325 dollars last week .. boy were those little blue haired ladies mad ! :P 
Confession is good for the soul .. 
Sometimes when you're with someone for a long time they start to treat you like you're less than you are . My knight in shining armor is turning out to be my knight in tin foil . Maybe it was the < PROPMALE > of something that you couldn't have and everyone else wanted . A caged lion is never as exciting as a free one , is it , Love ? Absence make the heart grow fonder . Perhaps it is time to take a leave of absence . Permanently . 
I prefer my own company anyway . Cur . 
Packing for a three day snowbaording trip in Big Bear . I promise to document photographically the contusions . For all of your twisted viewing pleasures of course . 
Just made a wonderful meal for herself and stared straight ahead determined to enjoy it and not hear or see her dogs piteous looks and whimpers . 
is wondering if light has a speed , does darkness ? 
loves her Daddy and will do anything he asks .. even change offensive Facebook pictures ! LOL ! 
Loves the sound if falling rain and wishes she could sleep outside in a tent so she could hear it all around her . 
It's like every night there's a battle waged by me against insomnia . I miss chat rooms to while away time in . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Herer . You started the fight ... now rest and we'll finish it . I'll celebrate your life in 4 days along with others who appreciated your hard work . 
is craving Ethiopian orIndian food . EXTRA spicy ! 
Going to Bingo with Mom again ! If I win , I'm getting my \hur did \"!" 
is watching the new video for \Babyfather\ " by < PROPFEMALE > . * sigh * She's my all time favorite . I swear she's a vampire . I've yet to see her age . Flawless . Effortlessly flawless . " 
My family is awesome ! 
I feel beautiful today . I call it having a \Brandi Quinones\ " moment ! " 
I really want to learn how to prepare and cook Indian food , but I am too intimidated by the amount of knowledge you need for spices alone . This is something , I have a feeling , I will be leaving to the professionals . 
Wish I had someone to go to Taco Tuesday with . More importantly , I wish I had someone to pay for it ! :P 
Had a lucid dream last night . Only I couldn't control my dream characters . Only my dreamscape . I even went so far as to tell one of them that they HAD to do what I said because it was MY DREAM . Do you know what the cheeky little monkey said back ??! \ 
\How do you know it's not MY dream ? \ " \ 
Sure God created man before woman . But then you always \ 
make a rough draft before the final masterpiece . ~ Author Unknown 
Misses her dog , Pepper , while she is taking care of < PROPFIRST > at the City Of Hope ! Lub you Pepperoni ! 
Lost my phone charger , so if you are trying to call or text me and I haven't gotten back to you , I am sorry ! \ 
I should have written down my phone number list :( 
Wish I were at the beach with a trashy romance novel , cheese , cured meats and two blond dudes names < PROPMALE > and Johann fanning me with banana leaves while the Shemar Moore lookalike feeds me grapes ... 
Going to troll used bookstores in Pasadena . Life is best between the sheets . \ 
;) 
YouTube gave me a warning strike for \hate speech\ " . Oh that's < PROPMALE > . That's Croesus < PROPMALE > . Must've been my \ " Thanks-taking\ " comment on a Thanksgiving video . I regret nothiiiiiiing ! :P " 
ROFL @ These \Booty Pop Panty\ " commercials !! XD " 
Last night was so much fun ! I met a ton of great new people and got to get in touch with some of my favorite old ones ! Love spending time with my friends and family :) 
You know you're a Californian when you feel a 5.4 earthquake , look at the other people in line , laugh for a second .. then continue ordering your Jamba Juice . 
Thinks < PROPMALE > Gibson should be raped by a pack of Inuits .... but \he will blow me first . \ " \ 
The Predator movie sucked , however , the previews for the new Resident Evil look promising . Down with the Umbrella Corporation ! :P 
is having sleep issues ( yet again ) and just forced herself to stay up all night in the hopes that she will be tired tonight at a normal time like a normal person . Two Ambiens and nothing . Madness . Welp .. at least I don't see shadow people in my peripheral vision yet ... 
Hello , my name is < PROPFEMALE > , and I have a BINGO addiction . :'( 
I'm craving Indian food . Again . 
Insomnia . Follows me around doggedly like some kind of preternatural stalker . Meh . Another month or two of this and I am treating myself to an all expense paid trip to a sleep disorder research center . 
Went to court today for some tickets I had . I've NEVER gotten out of a ticket . Every cop thinks other cops let me out of tickets and that THEY'RE going to be the staunch representation of moral uprightness and be the one to give me one . Here's 1000 dollars I don't have for infractions that exist only in the minds of those willing to have them enforced upon them . Va t'empaler encule . Excuse my French . Literally . 
is daydreaming of the outskirts of Dubai . 
is trying to decide between Pho and sushi . 
I miss Myspace .. and while I'm at it , I miss chat rooms too ! 
* yawn*\ 
Off to my alternate reality . 
Bar Sinister tonight . Should be fun . 
Anyway , we all have baggage . You are burdened with that most brutal and \ 
unendurable of gifts - intelligence and self-awareness . So much easier to be \ 
a fucking idiot . \ 
~ Jerry Stahl ~ 
Yaaaay for the Chilean miners ! Yah willing they will ALL be out soon ! :) 
Overcast . Perfect day for fishing . \ 
* trots off to Mission Viejo Lake * 
Is wondering if she will have to just break down and MAKE her < PROPFEMALE > Baker banana skirt costume . \ 
* < PROPFEMALE > sigh * 
If the rhythm doesn't suit me , I'll just march to the beat of my own damn drummer . 
I can't STAND being broke , having no smoke and being told \We're still going 
And yes , as a matter of fact , I DO have the girl flu . 
Let's see how long before my anger induced bravado wears away and I erase everything for today . I call 1 hour before I revert back to the self effacing boot licking lackey in the guise of a girlfriend . 
\The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery . There is always more mystery . \ " \ 
is battling the first bout of flu for 2011 . I can't believe I lasted until November . I was so trying for a year of invulnerability . Meh . 
So very very very very very very bored . Who wants to go out tonight ? 
I'm not wild ... maybe a bit feral .. but definitely NOT wild . \ 
* wink * 
< PROPFEMALE > is touring next year !! She's coming !! The Pied < PROPFEMALE > of Sensual Elegance will be here !! Oh , < PROPFEMALE > ! Oh , SADE !!!!! \ 
* prepubescent squeal * 
I ate some of the free tacos < PROPFIRST > in the Box was giving away yesterday . I remember thinking as I opened the thing to administer much needed hot sauce , \This looks like some kind of soy paste/peanut butter type \ " meat\ " . This certainly can't end well . \ " \ 
I'm not going to throw a fit if you leave to go out with your friends . I would never condescend . Goodbye , have fun , and please don't look at me oddly if I make it back home after you do . After all , you put in so much more work when you are a female left alone to her own devices . Drinks may be free , but they sure aren't cheap . Toodles . 
\In order to know virtue 
When the student is ready , the Master will appear . 
Taco Tuesday and no one to go to Taco Tuesday with . :( Time to hit up Craiglist \Platonic\ " section and find some company . I'm so lame . \ 
Was thinking about old Nickelodian shows . What do these < PROPFEMALE > Montana watching newbs know about \The Adventures of < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE >\" and \ " Salute Your Shorts\ " ? ;) " 
Packing , moving , buying gifts , Christmas , my Mother moving , the job situation and the car situation . Calgon .... take me awaaaaay !! 
Received the brand new California Drivers License . Pretty cool looking . Now all I have to do is nuke it for about 5 or 7 seconds to disarm the chip so \They\ " can't track me . \ 
is moving today . Trying to get as much done as I can while there is a lull in the rain 
Finally finished moving . At my mothers . She'll be moving on the twenty eighth . Two moves in two weeks . Yay . 
1 ) I'm back . Yay . Moving is over\ 
2 ) < PROPMALE > , your present is coming . \ 
3 ) My lucid dreaming is coming along nicely 
Do any of us really know everybody on our friend list ? Here is a task for you . I want all my fb friends to comment on this status about how you met me . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . You will be amazed at the results you get in 12 hours . 
Are you still mad that I kicked you into the pool while yelling \This is Sparta ? \"??" 
\ ... we don't need no thought control . No dark sarcasm in the classroom ... \"" 
* Doing the Happy Dance*\ 
Yes 1,000 more dollars towards my car fund ! Thanks Daddy !!!!!! I'm almost there ! :) 
Is going to IKEA . They think they can make you walk through the whole damn store and you'll come out with more than what you originally came for . They have not met me and my Mother . We'll stroll along right to the end for the 99 cent breakfast with nothing in hand but a catalog . Nej , IKEA . Nej . 
My Uncle < PROPFIRST > and his wife JUST had their new baby not even half an hour ago !! \ 
* grinning harder than The Joker !! * Welcome to Earth little baby ! 
is happy there aren't any of those asinine effing < PROPFEMALE > grams and dyed carnations being delivered to classrooms and reminding me that I am a complete failure at love . \ 
* Acerbic smile and enthusiastic thumbs up * 
Nothing like seeing a picture of the new 2011 Sports Illustrated cover model to get you out of your sweats . -_- 
Free DnB and Dubstep show @ The Avalon tonight in Costa Mesa . I need to dance off some of these after Valentines day half off chocolates . 
Recovering from that nasty little bug that's going around . Waking up and going directly to the Porcelain God to pray is no bueno . :( 
I have 4b hair . Don't know what that means but sounds good to me ! :) 
1 hour full body massage . Yes !! The crying baby in the background detracted from the ambiance , just a bit , but it was a wonderful experience . Thanks < PROPFIRST > ! Second favorite behind Brookhurst . 
Have this collection of vintage romance comics that my Mother owned when she was a teenager . I am trying to find a reputable site that will help me ascertain the value . 
Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission . - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
No , I'm not going to watch the Oscars . I know this may be foreign to some , but I just don't care about these people . What they're wearing . How many jewels they have on . How many squares of paper they use to wipe their arses . < PROPFEMALE > just don't care . 
Ok . Today is the day . The braids are coming out . There are so many of them , that this is going to be a two day job . Ugh . 
Day 2 of braid removal . This is going to go well into day number three . Why oh why did I get micros ??? 
Craving an In & Out double double with grilled AND raw onions and chopped chilies . 
A nice heavy rain is perfect for fishing . The barometer drops and they start getting hungry ! Too bad I don't know any REAL troopers who could actually hang . \ 
\ 
* looking at Bleu * 
Seeing my Grandma today ! Hopefully she will cook . Her and my mother always try to outdo each other and the casualty of war is often my stomach ! Yay !
