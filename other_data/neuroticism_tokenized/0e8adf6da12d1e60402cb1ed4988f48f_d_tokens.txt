New to facebook . not really sure what to do or what i'm doing ...? 

I haven't decided whether the final < PROPMALE > scene in toy story 3 is touching or awkward , especially when he whispers a farewell to his toys from a distance ? btw , sorry if you havent seen it yet , i didnt really give much away . 
feeling a little blue today . the monotony of my summer is getting to me ... not even ice cream excites me anymore :/ 
Watched Inception ! recommend it 
Relieved to see familiar faces at the ice cream shop ! thanks for coming < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , etc !! :D 
a lady at the grocery store asked in all seriousness if i had twin powers and that i should practice my twin telepathy ... the conversation only got weirder from there O_O

This is I LOVE MY SISTER week . If you have a sister who has made you laugh , \
