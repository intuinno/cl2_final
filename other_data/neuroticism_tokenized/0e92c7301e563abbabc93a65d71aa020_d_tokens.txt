ATTENTION : Apparently the group that told everyone to change their profile pics to cartoons was a group of PEDOPHILES . They're doing it because if children see pictures of cartoons the child wil accept the friend request quicker . It was currently on \internet frauds\ " and will be on tv tonight . Awareness . post this as your status & warn people to change their profile pics back . "
