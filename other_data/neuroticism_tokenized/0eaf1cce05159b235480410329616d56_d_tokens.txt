HAPPY NEW YEAR'S TO EVERYONE ! Having an amazing time with my family . < PROPFEMALE > is enjoying all the attention =] Can't forget all the amazing food =] Can't believe ' 2010 ' flew by so fast . Guess that's what happens when you become a parent . Thank You Lord for Everything ! =] 

new to facebook 
Going to the hospital 2x a week on tuesdays and fridays for heart tones and BPP my little baby is healthy and very active as always . she will be here 2 weeks ! im very miserable swollen & tired . trying to get through these last few days ... 
Got nervous this morning . The doctors said its getting closer to that time where they really need to keep an eye on her . She wasnt doing too good for the first 10 minutes but she started to act right . If she would have stayed in sleep mood , then they would have had to do a bunch of things and kept me in the hospital and deliver her . Going back friday and seeing the specialist ... 
BABY < PROPFEMALE > IS BORN AND FINALLY HOME !!! born thursday feb . 11th , 2010 . 7lbs 20ozs at 20 7/8 inches ! had a rough struggle through jaundice hopefully it will stay down ! 
just overwhelmed with being in an extremely cluttered room . between mine , scotts , and the babys stuff .... theres just too much stuff ! ( cant wait for our own place ) 
It's First Child Appreciation Week .... put your first child as your profile picture and post birth stats in comments ! 
got to spend time in glenmora for a couple of days and loved it . i was doing things i use to and loved it ! and i love that my incision is completely healed and i feel great . walked around a lot yesterday and starting to get back to my old self ! 
got my computer back to working !!!! oh how i missed it so much !!!! my lovly laptop with happy < PROPFEMALE > stuff !! 
GOT MY LAPTOP TO BACK ! it is now virus free and virus protected ! now its back to my happy < PROPFEMALE > keyboard , millions of songs on itunes , and my pics !!! =] HAPPY AND I KNOW IT ( CLAP , CLAP ) 
internet is acting up over here . facebook is literally the only website i can get on . all the others take hours !!!! confused bt weather to blame the internet or my computer ? my laptop did just get healed ... 
INTERNET'S BACK UP !! And this pleases Gabby very much ! =p ( jumping around in a circle , clapping my hands , and giggling ) 
Going to go see the family that i miss soooo much ! All tha family from my dad's side downsouth for one big supper ! whoo hoo ! got < PROPFEMALE > love that cookin ! 
Just got back around 12 midnite from downsouth . HAD A GREAT TIME !! enjoyed seeing everyone again , just always tired ... < PROPFEMALE > loved it till we had to go ... sorry lil one =[ 
GOT TO SEE < PROPFEMALE > IN WONDERLAND by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > in 3D !!!!! we went to walmart and found < PROPFEMALE > two outfits ! one is coveralls and they are so CUTE ! and a really nice actually easter dress !!! none of those lil ugly ones , its cute and yellow to match with her cousin Christian ! EASTER PICTURES !!! and CONGRADS to my brother for getting engaged to the woman he loves last night ! I WAS THERE IT WAS CUTE !!! =] =] =] 
its funny how all these young people are getting engaged right before my eyes and yet there dating time is < PROPFEMALE > short .... if i could go back i wouldnt get prego cuz i would have been one of those people that would have waited till being with that person for a long time first ... ( i prob wld have just kept saying no bec of commitment issues ) 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and I went to the nursery festival yesterday .... and you wont believe it but there was really no point in going ! Everything was EXPENSIVE ! If only they could have paid for our gas .... 
I have a very painful abscess on my breast . It became this way because apparently i didnt have the right antibiotics for mastitis =[ there truly is something more painful than a tooth ache ... its an abscess ... and when you dont have a very strong and powerful pain killer ..... UNBEARABLE PAIN { currently high off percocet so for now , pain doesnt exist =]} 
at rapides hospital . just got out of surgery . i have a tube running through the problem ... going to be here for a few days ... < PROPFEMALE > , Mommy misses you and knows she has to go through this to get better so she can be there for you ! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BABY ! =[ say goodnight < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Im at Rapides Hospital . I finally got to see my daughter today , made my day a little easier . I miss her so much ! They are going to re-patch my boo boos up . They are still trying to get rid of this infection . It was a pretty big one . They took one pint of thick bad stuff out when they did they surgery , and thats not including all the bad stuff i have been draining . 
Im on the road to recovering . The little towel thing is not inside anymore , i just have two little things , one inside each hole to soak up anything . im taking antibiotics by mouth now . on a drip for something ... taking pain meds by mouth . i maybe recovering but im aggravated and in alot of pain . 
Might be coming home tomorrow or so ... the antibiotics are really tearing up my stomach . its like a battle with myself just to eat a little . very frustrated , aggravated , and just wanting to take it out on something ! still have a lot of healing to do .... just hanging on , never giving up ! 
Going through a roller coaster of emotions from furious to depressed . Im recovering very well from the surgery and probably coming home today . Im missing my little girl . Cant wait to hold her and see her and be there for her once more . Still praying and staying strong . 
in the process of healing . im glad i was able to enjoyed Easter with my loving husband and beautiful daughter . we all three had a great day ! HAPPY EASTER !! 
Enjoying life as it quickly passes by with a wonderful , caring , and loving husband ! Enjoying all the good and BAD times ( every second really ) with my strong , animated , and loving daughter ! I love everyday God has given me and blessings he has given to me and my family ! I'm way too luck ! =p

People need to understand that people with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Its Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra care and understanding ! 
MY FACEBOOK IS MESSING UP ! ITS ADDING AND BLOCKING PPL FAN SITE AND CRAP ! IT MESSING UP ! AM I THE ONLY ONE ? IM THINKING ABOUT DELETING FACEBOOK , I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SAFE WEBSITE !! \

Why are people friends on here when you hide there status and dont really connect with them on here .... i find its a nice way of saying we not friends so i delete them but yet people get mad when i do .... all i have to say is : IF YOUR MY FRIEND THEN WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO HIDE MY STATUS AND IGNORE ME ???

my sugar keeps bouncing up and down a lot . very tired and frustrated by it . all will be better soon . going to see if i can change my insulin when i see my doctor . 
got a headache bec i have hiccups =[ 
They say a woman was created from a man's ribs . Not the head to be superior or from the feet to be walked on , but from under the arm to be held and next to the heart to be loved ? 
at < PROPFEMALE>'s house watching the boys play xbox as the girls cook . =] R.E.L.A.X.I.N.G 
Going to go back to the AT&T store tomorrow hoping they will fix my sim card . Already upset with them and how they treat costumers . Starting work books at school tuesday . life right now is like one big blur in the mirror that wont come out .

Zoo Boo tomorrow with my beautiful daughter < PROPFEMALE > ! 
well , was unable to go to the zoo boo . and i still think it is safer to go to zoo boo instead of trick or treating around town . someone said i would need to buy reflective tape or < PROPFEMALE > flashlights at the zoo bec it has enough lights . so have to skip out on trick or treat and rodeo so my bby can go to zoo boo . and there is still the fall festi at church . ( she will be a beautiful angel ! ) 
< PROPFEMALE > had a wonderful time at the zoo boo . waited about 2 hours in line and did the walk through and stopped to try and take pictures which lasted about 40 minutes . THE POINT IS : < PROPFEMALE > had a good time and is out ni ni . =]
