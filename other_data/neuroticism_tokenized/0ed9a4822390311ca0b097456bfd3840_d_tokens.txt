Ah ! Homework sucks .. =/ 
each momment of a happy lover's hour is worth an age of dull and common life . 
Remember your unique , just like everybody else . 
60% of what an American says is a lie . 
fireflies yay ! 
Zac is standing . < PROPFEMALE > has a tummy ache .

No brush in bathroom . o_O 
Not replaced ? Bullshit .

< PROPFEMALE>'s my teammate in pool . \ 
< PROPMALE > to angelica : not to turn you against < PROPFEMALE > , but she called you ugly . 
Happy New Year everyone . =) 
I'm never peeling potatoes again . 
Birthday's are good for you . Statistics show that the more you have the longer you live . 
What ? Your blushing ?! Oh stop it .. ='D 
Make me smile . 
You make me smile . =D 
Marilys snores . 
NEEDS TO JOG NOW ! 
Ahhhh ! Facebook is confusing . 
Ahh ! A stray cat came into my house looking for Bootsy . Scared the living crap out of me . 
So ... I kinda have this craving for < PROPMALE>'s .. Anyone want to take me there ? 
Wants to go jogging . I hate the rain . =/ 
Has a < PROPMALE > backache . 
A word to the wise isn't necessary . It's the stupid ones who need the advice . 
I don't want to achieve immortality through my work . I want to achieve it through not dying . -Woody < PROPFIRST > 
< PROPMALE > don't do it . I'll beat you up . 
Is it jogging time ? Yes it is . =D 
Procrastination is the < PROPMALE > of keeping up with yesterday . 
Sunday's are starting to look like the best day of the week . ;) 
Ahh . My plans have failed . I should stop making them . =] 
Ahhh ! Going to Jacksonville . Text me ... I don't want to go ! T_T 
My Saturday plans : Be dragged to my mom's friends house .. To sit around and have a play date with her friends daughter . End up probably driving home , and getting her ultra late , so I would be unable to do my original plan with someone I actually wanted to < PROPFEMALE > out with . Am I happy about this ? Not at all . 
What a jip . lol 
Ahh .. I fell jogging and now I'm cut on both my hands , knee , and elbow . I'm way too accident prone . 
< PROPMALE > is a super hero . 
Ahhh ! < PROPMALE > made me cheesecake ! xD 
Going hiking tomorrow . If I never come back , I've been eaten by a bear . 
Back from hiking . I'll put up pictures when I get them . =D 
Sounded like it was going to be a epic story , but he never wrote back to \Why what happened ? \ " Thanks dad . =] Going jogging . Wont be back for a really long time . " 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s house .. sitting next to < PROPMALE > .. On < PROPFEMALE>'s computer . =] 
I came to the conclusion that my mom is the reason i HATE shopping . 
I surrender to the strawberry ice cream . 
\When I go to your house I'm going to sing all those songs to your mom until she throws up cause she's so annoyed . \ " Thanks < PROPMALE >." 
One more day . Then it's jogging time in the morning . =D 
And I'm going to fix the roof for 6 bucks so I can buy easter things . Yay ! =D 
Drove my mom to the hospital cause of a hurt ankle .. She's ok . But now I'm tired . Jogging and then going to the mall with Marilys .. Text me . =] 
So I pretty much slept all day ... I don't feel good about this at all . 
I think my friends are going to be faking happiness for awhile . 
Your not you when your hungry , Snicker's satisfy . 
So yea < PROPMALE>'s bbq was great , we brought boards from the backyard and ate pizza . Little big planet .. Good game . You guys are the best . =D 
First day back was just as I expected ... Boring as psdjioawkjd . =/ 
Spaghetti on a Monday . 17 years it took for them to get away from tradition . HALLELUJAH ! 
I found a dead lizard meshed in with the junk I poured out of the backpack I let Marilys borrow .. I can't wait to tell her . xP 
R : Ravishing O: Original N : Nimble 
I can't wait until I'm away from here . 
My life is amazing ! I couldn't be more happier . =D 
Everything didn't go as planned .. But I still love you < PROPMALE > . =] 
So far .. My birthday plans are amazing ! 
I LOVE MY LIFE ! 
Old Town + Best friends + Hacky sack - Money - Way home = SLDKJOISJDL AWESOME NIGHT ! 
UDHANUNFKANSF <-- That's what I'm feeling right now . 
Thanks for the \happy birthday's\ " guys . =D You all made it extra special . xD " 
I think i'm going to jog . 
Ahhhh i need a life . 
So i put a dollar in the vending machine .. A water comes out .. Followed by 25cents . =) 
So the chinese restuarant just sang happy birthday to me with a candle on a muffin . =) 
About to jog with my aunt . 
Suppose to be doing a research paper .. But instead I'm procrastinating on Facebook . =/ 
Procrastination + nothing to procrastinate with = jogging . =D 
Me : i must have been 15 when i talked to him . -long pause- angie : I'm 15 right ? Me : no your 16 . 
Bleh . I need something to keep me busy for 30 mins . =/ I'm as bored as psakndkjfnasdf . 
Growing up i've always been pop-pop's little girl . I think half of the reason is because i really didn't have a dad .. The other cause he's hilarious ! 
So I think I'm finally going to officially start on that paper now .. After some cranberry juice and a nice long jog . =D 
So i'm wearing a shirt that says \boggy creek elementary\ " and this girl was like \ " ahhh you go to my school\ " didn't think i looked that young . " 
I love how it takes until the soles are falling off for my mom to buy me new shoes . Shows how much my family likes shopping . 
\what's wrong with me . Why did she have to cheat on me ? \ " i don't think i've ever seen my brother so heart broken . D'= " 
About to jog in shoes made for jogging . =D 
Ahhh My friends are amazing .. They actually beleieve me when I say my throat is closing up from the lack of vegies . =P 
According to my alarm clock it's 63 degrees in my room .. And I'm sweating like a donkey . Either the pills aren't working , Or I have too much trust in that alarm clock . 
I'm sick . I'm probably not going to be at school tomorrow . 
Made a smoothie . My brother liked it . Be proud of me < PROPMALE > . =D 
Aw < PROPMALE > worries about me . 
Don't have to wear my retainer during the day anymore ! 
Why isnt < PROPMALE > answering his phone ?! 
I have the most amazing boyfriend ever ! 
I came to school untired on the wrong day .. There's actually nothing to do . =\\ 
Ahh ! I love my boyfriend ! 
My thoughts of today are completly undescribable . Today was wayy too amazing ! I love you < PROPMALE > ! 
Jog I'm go to ing . 
My joints hurt . 
My soda exploded on me the second time i wanted to drink from it . Only that would happen to me . 
I bit my tongue when i sneezed and now its swollen and bleeding . =\\ 
My boyfriend is soooo fjxdufuhgghs amazing !! 
Ugh .. It's raining . 
My grandfather : Things would be so much cheaper if we could all just be naked . ( lol ) 
My mom thinks were letting the < PROPFEMALE > run around the yard to clean the cage . That's not what's happening at all . 
Going to the loop .. Maybe ? 
Grandma : oh you just came in . My cat : meow . Grandma : yea . ( lol ) 
I thought I was going to the loop .. But instead we walked to Mc Donalds met up with < PROPMALE > and played DJ Hero . =D 
Ahhh .. jog I go wanna . D'= 
Marilys : \Tell me when your going ? \ " Me : \ " No . \ " Marilys : \ " What ?? \ " Me : \ " My bad .... Ok . \"" 
Another favorite chapstick ruined by the dryer . 
Bleh .. For some reason I only plan to study for the first time in my life . 
Worst day of my life . 
Call me , text me .. If you want to reach me .. If you want to IM me , that's ok . 
My day only got worse . Hopefully tomorrow is a better day . 
I guess i'm done waiting for a call that isn't going to happen . Goodnight . 
My cat is meowing in my face . Jog I go . =D 
Today feels like it's going to be a better day . =) 
I just ran outside in the pouring rain to get stuff out of the car . And as soon as i got inside it abruptly stoped raining . Story of my life . 
Believe it or not , I actually cleaned my room . Like cleaned inside my stuffeverythinginsidesonoonesee'sthemess spot . =D 
Theres no life after you . 
99% on my research paper ! Highest grade in the class . < PROPMALE > was right behind me with a 95% . =D Were amazing last < PROPFEMALE > writers ! 
We turn left and my grandfather puts on the right signal . So when it didnt click off he left it on for it to click off by itself . Its sad how this made my day . 
So apparntly my family vacation is going to the beach , safari , and the zoo . Growing up when you live with my mom is impossible . 
I MISS < PROPMALE > ! 
I wish I was bored with nothing to do . So much better than cleaning for a garage sale . =/ 
My mom talks to me like she talks to the cat . Sometimes I don't know how I should feel about that . 
Second place is the first loser . 
Red < PROPFIRST > commercial's suck . 
Strawberry Whoppers save the day once again . =D 
Borrow money from a pessimist - They don't expect it back . ;) 
Last half mile of my hike made my day . Next time you walk 6 < PROPMALE > in the Ocala National < PROPMALE > , be sure to grab your mother and sing marching songs with her . Might make your day too . =D 
The llama spit on my mom . Lmao 
Ahhh .. gatorland is only fun when your fear spits on your moms face , and your 6 foot tall brother is too scared to walk in a room with flying birds . lol I love my life . 
WTF ?? I should be sleeping right now . 
My cat keeps bringing live lizards in the house . This explains why I always find dead ones lying in odd places in my room . 
Me and my mom going on a safari = us witnessing deer having sex . 
The teenage mind is disturbing . All I hear about is who everyone wants to \do\ " and what they smoked last night . Makes me hate being a teenager . " 
Yogurt is revolting . I wish I could destroy it's exsistance . 
It's amazing how < PROPFEMALE > can brighten my mood . =D 
This is crazy ! Not being able to sleep sucks . 
I love how my mom remembers to buy my brother's unhealthy soda , but consistly forgets my cranberry juice . 
* me eating a plum*\ 
My brother : \What are you eating ? \ " \ 
I love waking up to no one being awake/no one being home . It's so peaceful . =D 
WTF ?? No one is doing anything interesting today ! For a weekend .. It sure does suck . 
Don't take life so seriously . It isn't permanent . 
If I agreed with you , we'd both be wrong . 
< PROPFEMALE > got her lip pierced ! =O 
I used to like the rain .. But now it's keeping me from baking cookies . -_- 
MOST AMAZING DAY OF MY LIFE ! 
Grandma : * stern voice * why are you wearing a shirt ? \ 
Grandfather : o_O cause it's the most presentable thing to do ! 
< PROPMALE > is superman . Don't let him fool you . 
I'm not crazy I'm just alittle unwell . 
1 thing I'm going to miss when I move out ... The funny things that happen EVERYDAY . 
* KABOOM * <-- That was my mind . 
< PROPMALE > is the most amazing person in the world !!!!! ( and no this isn't < PROPMALE > typing this through < PROPFEMALE>'s facebook ...... in case thats what you were thinking ) o_O 
I don't know if I should be happy about being home alone , or sad cause everyone's at the hospital for my grandma's operation . -_- 
My life is brilliant . 
This is the most relaxed summer ever . Could use a job though . =( 
Me and < PROPMALE > went to warp tour and chased a rabbit around my shed . Day well spent ..? No .. Not really . =/ 
I love my superman . =D 
WTF ?? I never win . 
Ron : \We'll talk tonight . \ " \ 
I think < PROPMALE > proved , just today , that he is the MOST AMAZING PERSON TO EVER WALK THE EARTH ! 
* mom's phone rings*\ 
Mom : \CRAP ! I left my phone at home ! \"" 
I have 2 houses to stay at for a week , and i locked myself out of both of them . Pretty smart huh ? 
I got the best boyfriend , a puppy , and coupons to steak n ' shake . Life couldn't be better . =D 
Buying school cloths isn't that great , it means school is almost back in session . 
Everytime I point a fake gun at my grandma she gives me a thumbs up . 
I have this crazy feeling that this puppy is worse than having a child . 
When my brother runs out of batteries for his xbox controller , he fetches new ones from my mom's toothbrush . Lol 
Senior year classes suck . 
Going to < PROPMALE>'s today ! xD 
Sooo < PROPMALE > finally met my grandma . =D Great day ! 
If I'm addicted to loving you , And you addicted to my love too . We can be them two birds of a feather that flock together . 
Gateway changed alot in one summer vacation . Their starting to really limit the attire with this \no skinny jeans\ " stuff . " 
So I told myself that this year I was not going to be lazy and actually make straight A's ... But unfortantly , that theory is slowly failing . 
< PROPMALE > needs to commit to his duties as superman and learn how to fly ! 
My alone time : when i take < PROPMALE > outside to get him away from everybody else . =) 
I hate being unhappy when my reasoning for it sucks . 
Waiting for the epic plans < PROPMALE > has for me tomorrow . =D ( Right < PROPMALE > ? =P ) 
Ron : \Our relationship is like an unlimited supply of toothpaste . \"" 
An airplanes faster than a cadillac and a whole lot smoother than a camels back but I don't care how you get to me , just get to me . 
After spending my whole morning looking for my favorite pair of jeans , < PROPMALE > comes ( at 5:15 pm ) dragging them across the floor of the living room . That's my kind of luck . lol 
I need 1,378,634,929,658,465,154 National Geographic magazines . 
I think I'm going to write a poem for < PROPMALE > . o_O 
I just realized that the thing my dog has been chewing on all day is a dead lizard . 
People need to stop taking me so seriously . 
My dog is a rotten animal . 
< PROPFEMALE > will happen . And it wont be good . 
My mom is going on a road trip today . Goodbye good food . =( 
People are so easily angered these days . 
Me : i was going to wear tye dye but i didn't have dye . \ 
Angelica : well , you could have used sticky notes . 
=( <-- That's me . 
Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > ! =D 
And this is where my process of procrastinating begins . 
Now I'm done procrastinating .. TIME TO CLEAN ! ='( 
Girl on my bus : \you is stupid . \"" 
>=/ 
Ocala National < PROPMALE > is a beautiful place . 
5 more mins and i'm out of 4th pd ! =) 
Ang : what a cute monkey . \ 
Marilys : it's a zebra . \ 
Ang : no zebra's have different strips . \ 
Me : monkey's don't have strips . \ 
All of us : laugh !!!! 
Grandparents : ( about my dad ) He's a good looking guy . \ 
Me : Of course he is .. Where else would I get my good looks from ? \ 
Grandparents : ME ! 
Today was a good day . Let's see if we can keep that up . 
So apparntly my mom has no spirit for anything . What happened to her child like ways ? =( 
Talent show was funnn ! 
Mom : you see the fireworks . \ 
Brother : no . \ 
Mom : you can't see them ?? Their bigger than life ! 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone . 
I just introduced youtube to my mom . 
Had the best thanksgiving break of my life . =) 
Me : now mom , remember what i taught you . \ 
Mom : * BRAARR * 
While < PROPMALE > feels ignored .. He sings about it on the phone . 
Is it bad that I laugh at < PROPMALE>'s insanity ? Nahhhhhhhh . 
After sitting here for 20 mins analyzing my life , I came to the conclusion that nothing in my life is interesting enough to say on facebook . 
WHY IS < PROPMALE > SO MEAN TO ME !? 
Ron : You just said you don't like cream cheese . \ 
Me : NO . I said I don't like green cheese . 
I swear ... I live my life for everyone else but me . =/ 
Grandma : how do you workout with these weights .. Their heavy ! \ 
Me : grandma , their only 5 pounds . 
My aunt is strong ! She just picked up out of bed . 
Wtf ? Why is it so cold outside ? 
It sucks that my life is alot more complex than it looks . 
mom : * tries to feed the dog food*\ 
Me : No .. Don't feed him food . You can't keep doing that . \ 
mom : * slips the food really fast under the table*\ 
Me : WHAT DID I TELL YOU !! 
Grandfather : who she talking to ? 5513 ? \ 
Me : o_O lynn ? \ 
Grandfather : is that her name ? I only know it by the phone number . 
Me : are you ok ? You look kinda dead . \ 
* silence * \ 
* pokes cheek*\ 
Danny : oh me ? I thought you were talking about < PROPFEMALE > . 
Never going on a hiking trip without my brother . =D 
Yesterday was the best day of my life . =D 
The process of procrastination on my critical analysis starts now ! 
Grandma : did the cat come out of the closet ? \ 
Me : is she gay ? 
My senior year of highschool sucks . =/ 
I only have 391 words .. And I'm stumped . =( 
Me : let's stop being dramatic and just be nice to eachother and be friends . \ 
Ron : * laughs * \ 
Me : =\\ 
My wise friend once told me : \Drink juice . It will make you feel better . \ " =] " 
Me : it was some kind fruit . \ 
Angelica : vanilla ? 
I hate being sick . =( 
Wtf ? How is anyone going to have any sympathy for my sickness , if everyone is sick at the same time as me ? So depressing . =( 
Today's accomplishment : Convinced my mom to buy me a giraffe cake for my 18th birthday . =D 
If you don't want me to tell people the mean things you said to me .. Don't say mean things to me . 
Mom : Grandma , everytime I look in this cabinet you get in trouble ! \ 
Grandma : Well then stop looking in there . 
Stop complaining about me not texting you back .. My phone broke . =) 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > : Spent playing games with < PROPMALE > online and watching A Christmas Story with my mom and < PROPMALE > . Best Christmas < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > r ! 
Jason : What did Batman say to < PROPFIRST > before he got in the batmobile ? \ 
Me : I have no idea , tell me . \ 
Jason : < PROPFIRST > , please get into the batmobile carefully and buckle your seatbelt . \ 
Me : Did I not watch enough batman ? I don't find that very funny . 
4:11 AM . I think my sleeping pattern is ruined . 
Christmas Presents : Shirt , Cup , Hat , Chapstick , soap , $100 , and $5 from a scratch and win card . =) Thanks everyone who got me the stuff . 
I wish I was tired right now . 
Gettng new phone on Thursday . =) ( possibly ) 
Max : Sticks nose in garbage . \ 
Grandma : Why is he being such a piss head today ??!! 
Got a new phone !!! =) 
Everytime i start eating starbursts i see the subway commercial where everyone is getting so fat their pants buttons are flying off . It's kind of lame . 
I'm starting to hate change . 
Me : i don't like cereal . \ 
Danny : * takes off my sock and throws it at me * i can't believe you don't like cereal . * leaves room * 
Scrapbooks are lame . =/ 
Facebook only seems to interest me when I have a huge project due the next day . 
I am not happy with you ! 
Stephen : i lost my sunglasses again ... \ 
Me and < PROPFIRST > look back seeing my brother wearing them . \ 
Christopher : you dropped them . 
My day spent with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > : Asking our best friend < PROPFIRST > O'Hora if he has a girlfriend/boyfriend . 
Grandma : Is that < PROPMALE > that keeps calling ? \ 
Me : Yea . \ 
Grandma : Well then take it off the hook . 
Life is not all beer and skittles . 
Today was a good day . =) 
Amelya Viera:Where's the eyes ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > Wright : It's a ham shark ... It doesn't have eyes . \ 
Amelya : Then how does it eat ? 
Breakfast : Potatoes from a can . o_O 
Why is Gateway full of sex addicts ? 
My brother and grandma watch jersey shore together . 
Fortune cookie : the harder the fall , the higher the bounce . 
< PROPMALE > Narvaez's birthday was AWESOME ! It was fun hanging with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Lupa , and < PROPMALE > . =D 
Grandfather : Get to bed kid ! \ 
Me : No . \ 
Grandmother : She's 17 she doesn't have to go to bed . \ 
Grandfather : YES SHE DOES ! She's still a child . \ 
Me : Well ... That's cool . But I'm not going to bed . \ 
Grandfather : -_- \ 
Me : =D 
It's amazing how the people who are the most mean are the ones who get mad the easiest when your mean to them . 
Me : I seem to be the only \average person\ " in the group . One of my best friends has a lip piercing and the other one now has a tatoo . \ 
Me : are you trying to ask for sympathy from me ? \ 
Ron : no , that's like trying to get sympathy from a dragon . 
My character on < PROPFIRST > party : you did it ! \ 
Mom : shut up you little piece of shit . 
I should have went to prom last year . Masquerade's are dumb . 
Me : guess what guys your invited to my giraffe party ! \ 
Marilys : well you know how i'm going to ruin it ? \ 
Me : how ? \ 
Marilys : I'm going to bring a llama . 
Grandma cadwell : i didn't like her , so i got a pie thrown in her face . Well when it wasn't illegal . 
Christopher : GED - good enough degree . 
* Everyone is quiet*\ 
Mom : I have to go to bed . \ 
Grandma : Why ? \ 
Mom : Cause < PROPFEMALE > is pissing me off ! \ 
Me : How ?? I'm just sitting here looking cute ! 
Mom : Pick up the poop and we can a play game . \ 
Me : I don't want to play a game .. So why would I pick up the poop to play one ? \ 
Mom : Look here smart ass ... JUST PICK UP THE POOP ! 
I think I miss playing board games . 
Yesterday was amazazing ! =D 
My teacher called me smart today . I would have felt alot more complimented if I didn't fail her class 3 years ago . 
Brother : that guy sucks when he raps . \ 
Me : you rap . \ 
Brother : uhh .. I'm sitting here . Your sitting there ... Uhh .. \ 
Me : we sittin everywhere . \ 
< PROPMALE > Hassan : I have to let my pet turtle squirtle go . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Cruz : I can take him . \ 
< PROPMALE > : I can't give him to you ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Why not ??? \ 
< PROPMALE > : Everyone knows that if you give your pokemon to another trainer they wont obey you . 
* < PROPMALE > jumps up on grandma*\ 
Grandma : I think it's time to make this dog fat like gizmo so that it doesn't jump up on me anymore ! >=/ 
Ron : i'm so tired today . I just want to sleep . \ 
Me : you want to come over today ? \ 
Ron : YEA ! 
* driving down 192*\ 
ron : is that a lion . \ 
* everyone looks*\ 
ron : oh it's just a cow . 
Beaches on a rainy day are only fun if you're only there because your skipping school . 
Guy at the stop : you look so young . You look 18 . \ 
Me : i am 18 . 
If this is what we've got , what we've got is gold . 
I now remember why i stopped wearing eyeliner . It's impossible to wash off ! 
One of my very few flaws : Little things bother me . Like people spelling \through\ " like \ " threw \"." 
Shopping with my mom and brother . Oh joy . 
I wish the tv was never invented . It ruins my life . 
Me : mom look a chicken . \ 
Mom : wow .. A chicken there and there is a goose over there living at that house . \ 
* drives by*\ 
me : oh .. It's not a chicken . It's a vulture 
So the start of my spring break was amazing ! < PROPFEMALE > Castro knows how to throw a party . ;) 
Stayed in Pj's all day today . Now I want to get dressed up and go somewhere .. But have nowhere to go . 
So there is a stray dog that wants inside my house . And when I walk outside he follows me . I think he might like me more than my own dog does . 
Today was a such a waste of life . I hope all my friends are happy . >=/ 
I guess staying out all night just isn't my cup of tea . 
Today is offcially the worst day i've ever had . 
My dog doesn't like me anymore . ( This is my depressing status for < PROPFEMALE > Castro . ) 
Today looks like it's going to be a good day . =D 
I was sick on Friday .. But I was fine for the rest of spring break . Now I'm sick again . I guess the thought of school makes me ill . 
With Graduation coming up , there's a good < PROPMALE > you will never see me again . Like this , and I'll message you everything i can confess to you . ( got it from < PROPFIRST >.) 
Buchanan Sean : Watch it just be 2 words .... Shut up Sean . \ 
me : o_O \ 
Sean : I mean 3 . 
Being sick is painful and boring . 
I'm going back to school tomorrow ! yay ! -_- 
We have pudding to last us for 3 months . Why ? Because the last time my mom bought pudding she didn't get any . Thanks for taking a stand mom . =) 
Prom is going to be amazing . =) 
I know I'm late with this information .. But besides from the sucky music PROM WAS AMAZING ! 
Pet peeve : When someone gets mad that I don't text them back . If our conversation was important ... It wouldn't be in text . 
Mom to my brother : Your so handsome .. and really smart . It's such a shame that you just waste your life playing xbox . Your going to be 35 and still be sitting in your room playing xbox ! \ 
Brother : By the time I'm 35 it wont be called xbox anymore . 
OH NO ! My brother just found the secret stash of gummies . They were nice while they lasted . =( 
Going camping . =D 
Best camping trip I've ever been on . =D 
Grandma : Tomorrow is < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday . She's going to be 27 . \ 
Grandfather : o_O \ 
Me : Wow ... I aged pretty fast . 
Today is another busy day . 
Mom : i don't know what < PROPMALE > is barking at . I looked out over the fence and no one is there . \ 
Me : he must be trying to warn everyone about zombies . \ 
Mom : your right 
Mom : i thought < PROPFEMALE > was hawaiian . 
I like the thought of sleeping in . But when it actually happens ... I regret it . 
Field day was amazing . =) 
< PROPFEMALE > lavigne-what the hell . =) 
Robin : wait the wedding is tomorrow and your just starting to shop now ? \ 
Mom : yep . \ 
Robin : wow , your starting early . Usually wait til your on your way . 
Wow ... Today isn't starting out so good . 
My generation is filled with idiotic , lazy slobs . I'm so excited for my future . 
4 more days ! =) 
Brother : * pretends to throw a water bottle at my grandma to give it to her . *\ 
grandma : don't shake it ! \ 
Chris : why ? It's just water . \ 
Grandma : oh . 
Sign at mcdonalds : \Sorry not power \"." 
Grandma : you guys want some provolone on your cheese . 
3 more days ! =D 
2 more days ! xD 
Running on 3 hours of sleep on my last day of school . I don't see this going very well . 
* my brother driving down the turnpike*\ 
mom : Stop driving so close to those cones ! If you hit one it will destroy the front end of my car . \ 
Brother : Don't tell me that . Tell me that when I hit one < PROPMALE > bears fly out . 
< PROPMALE > Narvaez just made my night . 
Buchanan < PROPFIRST > is a jerkface . 
Ha ha I found my way in . =D \ 
\ 
-Buchanan < PROPFIRST > 
I graduate today ! Yayy ! 
I have yet to feel like I actually graduated . Yesterday was a great night though . ;) 
I've come to the conclusion that I actually hate being busy .

I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you’ve had and what you’ve learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you’ve celebrated . 
My brother ate my chinese food . I think I officially hate him now .
