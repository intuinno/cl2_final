R.I.P. to my wonderful pencil sharpener . You lasted two whole months with mistreatment and crashes onto a hard , hard floor . We will miss you 
Rude people suck . 
I have so many things I still want to do n my life . I can't stop or pause for a minute bc then I might lose the opportunity to be great . 
Lock in's with 70 kids are officially the craziest thing I've ever attended . A burnt arm , loss of a nail , and many diff items flying thru air 
I was planning on being something worth mentioning , energy invested in someone I saw potential in ... who killed chivalry ? They need to get their sentence in ... 
I love bad days that end up as good days =) 
Reminicising about my 21st birthday when 1 ) I tripped over a cinder block and fell into a trashcan on my way into Blackout 2 ) I wore a white dress in an all black party ... and expected not to stand out ... and 3 ) One of my friends puked into champagne glasses perfectly , with no spill over . 
Gettttt it , get itttt !!! =) 
I'm mad at myself ! Who lays down at 8pm for a nap and doesn't wake up til 730 the next day ?! Now I'm not tired ... & I still wanna party . 
If you buy your 3XL white tee from a gas station ... you have no < PROPMALE > with me . And also , those have been out for 3 yrs . Just sayin . 
There are some things you can't change even if you try ... so I've learned that the best thing to do is accept it , and figure out how it can make you a better person . =) 
I have never been so upset with a class ful of children . Man I need to figure out how to get to these kids before the streets do ... 
Just remembered .... if hottness was an oreo , you'd be double stuffed . Lol ! Night was made . 
So I go to bed at 130 ... I wake up at 530 , get ready ... get all my school work together ... and now my keys have completely disappeared . I don't know where the eff they are . What do I do ? I had to call off one job .... hopefully I find them soon 
So .... after 3 hours of searching , a call off to one job ( I don't call in ... ever ) , three loads of laundry , cleaning out my car and my closet -- my keys were found . Ugh ! Why am I so dumb ? Lol 
People say don't mistake my kindness for weakness ... but what if your weakness is kindness ?? 
I'm soooo sleepy . Woke up at 4 for this speech tournament , ill be there til 3 or do , thn headed to babysitting . Long day ahead = lk 4 sodas ! 
So today , a student in my last hour was playfighting with another student . When I called him out on it , he yelled \don't ever talk to me again ! \ " Lmfao ... that hurts . " 
So is it sad that I get EXTRA excited about the small things like my airport fountain soda choice , and I stand there 4 abt 5 < PROPFEMALE > . like its a serious life decision ? 
Let's see if Black Friday in Massachusetts is any diff . From Black Friday in IL ... haha people are probably still just as ignorant =) 
I find it funny that as we drive , my dad is trying to guess which shopping establishment that each car is headed to ... by the type of car they're driving . 
Don't ask me why ... but I decided to eat a salami , egg , and cheese sandwich ... bad idea . Now I wanna puke . Shoulda stuck w dunkin donuts .. 
I wish I could be like a dog or a little kid and love unconditionally no matter what .... 
After seeing a turkey brined in a bucket , stealing remus from a LARGE yellow lab , shopping for hours for my new ipod , and a successful thanksgiving filled with fun , family , and xbox360 -- one more flight , and I'm home sweet home =) I missed my roomies ! 
Have u ever been on E on the highway and didn't have anywhere to stop , so u turned off the heat and turned on your hazard lights to make it to the gas station ?? Oh ... just me ?? Cool ... lol 
So the fact that < PROPFIRST > has made Call of Duty Black Ops his own personal drinking game has officially made my night ... =)

SNOW DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ! =) 
Sometimes I wonder if the next step I take will really be the best step ... & how do you make it your best , if you never truly know what's in store for you ? 
So I've come to the conclusion that you can sleep when you're dead , and that this is the season to celebrate . Ready for tonight !

Have you ever felt like you would give everything you have to make things better ? 
A lot of people walk in and out of my life ... but you're one of the only ones I truly wanted to stick around .... =) 
has anyone noticed that we're in the ... ' yeah you're screwed ' part of every weather chart ? 
slowly realizing that I cannot completely live my life to its fullest until I move to Mexico ... approximately 296 days until the big move . & hearts ; 
Winter , because of you , I've decided that I no longer want to live in a house owned by someone who doesn't plow his whole driveway or move a dilapidated truck out of a perfectly good parking space . Sincerely , \ 
Girl pushing her car out of a snowpile at 4am 
.... I think of what better ways to start the day than the AAA guy calling < PROPMALE > a dumbass ... oh wait , there are none .. 
He's putting chicken fertilizer on the driveway in the place of salt ... because he ran out . 
So I know you love these minute by minute updates ... but now they're literally dragging my car out by chaining it up to a flatbed truck .. 
Car is out . Landlord was officially called a dipshit about 13 times by the AAA guy ; then he spent about 5 minutes approximately telling me that I need to find a new house in the area . LOL I'm glad that he knows it as well as I do . Bedtime , up in 4 hours . 
Man ... watching this snow storm from this bus window has me HOPING ... PRAYING ... that I get to Chatham for this speech tournament safe ... 
Let's just say Ice + Stairs + < PROPFEMALE > = Fight my knee did * not * win ... But the roommate asked me if I want to put ice on it LOL and the other roomie called me hobbles ... Not feeling so great right now . 
I wish I didn't live in such a hellhole ... 
Happy < PROPMALE>'s Birthday everyone ... I know you're all out celebrating , but we must remember one of our best fallen presidents , helping begin with many civil changes in our country ! Bahaha =) #uknowurfromspringfieldwhen ...

Sooo ... my first orthopedic knee doctor appt is today ... not excited =/ 
I just know I have to be the strongest believer in ' everything happens for a reason ' .... & hearts ; 
Sooo ... the room I'm in for my MRI makes me feel funny . The sign says there's such a strong magnetic field that it can erase debit and credit cards ... somehow I don't think that's safe ! Lol 
I think the reason people hold on to memories so tightly is because memories never change ... when everyone else does . & hearts ; 
So ... I told my boss that I was having a midlife crisis ... and she told me to go get a few drinks . LOL 
Had a great day today ! =) Its not always what happens to you , but the way you react to the situation . Life is good & hearts ;

The hardest things about recovery from ACL surgery : not being able to walk far distances , pain , not working out , & que no puedo pasar tiempo con mi mejor amiga ! Te extraño !

Can't wait to live by the beach , and be able to have Miami Vices whenever I want . & hearts ;
