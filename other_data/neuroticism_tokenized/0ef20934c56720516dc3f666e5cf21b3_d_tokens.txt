\I think it was God that was the rapist .. so he could be born by his mom that he raped so he could kill himself as a sacrifice to himself to save you from the origional sin that he condemed you with because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree . .. I think\ " Kinda puts Christianity into perspective . "

The Inverse Butterfly Effect ; simply put it's my theory that we as humans have the ability to have an infinite level of positive influence on the world . This is achieved by one person helping , advising , or inspiring multiple people , then this effect dominoes whether on purpose or not . Until we are all in improved from each other . 
hackers deserve the death penalty . 
How is everyone ?
