“Watching you walk out of my life does not make me bitter or cynical about love , but rather makes me realize that if I wanted so much to be with the wrong person how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along . ” 
< PROPMALE>'s officially gone from scrubs ... D: 
feels like watching a < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > movie . and wrapping some skanky christmas panties . and sleeping . and drinking coffee . and smoking crack .

\All it takes to fly is to hurl yourself at the ground ... and miss \""

my work ethic ( or lack thereof ) is really limiting when it comes to things like research essays . however , my apathy ( which i definitely do not lack ) is playing a key role in me not dying from overstress right now . such is life . x ] 
happy birthday , < PROPFIRST > sullivan . :/ 
you know who would make me feel better right now ? < PROPFIRST > whitesides . but NO . I HAVE TO MISS SEEING THE USED LIVE BECAUSE IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT . i hate being a minor . last time i missed a concert , it was a7x in < PROPFEMALE > . and then one of them died . today sucks . 
Now everyone report to the dance floor , to the dance floor , to the dance floor . Now everone report to the dance floor . Alright , stop ... pajama time . Here little kiddies , on my lap .

AWESOME WEEKEND . 
you know you've changed when you had a fun night last night , but still would have rather been playing ninja and even crying with near-strangers . 
SO . EXCITED . FOR . THE USED . :D if i don't go , shit will go DOWN . 
if the silence takes you , then i hope it takes me too :] 
i now have a completely new appreciation for hockey ;D 
where the wild things are is ADORABLE . i just wish i could have seen the ending . D: 
my rhymes and records , they don't get made because my records and rhymes , they don't get made . if you rap like me , you don't get paid and if you roll like me , you don't get laid . ;] 
is tearing shit UP at SKI BRULE . ohhyeah . 
my face is ... burnt . the slopes look like rotting fruit . gotta love fake snow . xD 
what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you ? and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up and you're okay ? 
sharpen up your teeth , your dreams are more than worth defending in a fight that's never ending . go on , go ahead and prove me wrong . 
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body , but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke , thoroughly used up , totally worn out , and loudly proclaiming– “Wow ! What a Ride ! ” — < PROPMALE > S . Thompson [ i am completely in love with zacky baker ] <3 xD 
overrated boys and attention-starved girls : a little curious , a little insecure . they call it love , it might be pre-mature , but they don't need excuses ; to feel used , to feel lust , to feel something for once , to know there's somebody else just dying to feel anything , ready and willing . 
off to watch the office . maybe if i'm lucky , i'll get to see < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > doing the nasty again . YUM . sorry if i just made you jealous < PROPFEMALE > Winters i mean < PROPFEMALE > Schrute . xD 
i believe in the faith that grows and the four right chords can make me cry ; when i'm with you , i feel like i could die , and that would be alright , alright . :] 
watched titanic in its entirety for the first time last night . a little part of me died . and my tear ducts are swollen . D: BUT < PROPFIRST > IS SOOO FINE . xD 
it's BUSINESS DAYY . and i'm in my BUSINESS SOCKSSS . and tiffy's in her BUSINESS SHOESSS . 
holy tired . THE USED TONIGHT . :DDD 
i feel sorry for all you sad fucks that didn't see the used last night ! GREAT SHOW . i've never felt so alive and dead . 
live it , love it , know it not . 
i think the chain broke away , and i felt it the day that i had my own time ; i took advantage of myself and felt fine . 
awesome night ! I PWN N00BZ AT SLAPS . 
shall go on shining as a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world . 
i definitely have a new appreciation for new franken . :] 
i watched the proverbial sunrise coming up over the pacific , and you might think i'm losing my mind , but i will shy away from the specifics . 
BEST TORNADO WARNING EVER . i love everyone i got to experience it with , and boy did we experience it like balluhs with ring pops and ERRYTHANGG . ;] 
i , i am almost nowhere , and i'm getting there fast . but you , you're the hope in my cold stare . 
and now it seems that i have found nothing at all . 
i think ... a little part of my brain died . along with my fingertips . AWESOMEEE . 
i hate the feeling that i'm missing out on a great night . :[ 
i want warm summer nights to come right NOW . :[ 
If I were the rain that binds together the Earth and the sky , whom in all eternity will never mingle , would I be able to bind two hearts together ? 
is eating a vegetarian ham sammich . OH YEAH . 
and in that moment , i swear we were infinite . :] 
so , in the past week i've been so kindly compared to < PROPFIRST > from scrubs and < PROPFEMALE > from she's out of my league . thanks , guys . too bad i consider that a WIN . ;D 
go shit in your hand ! yeah , i'm awesome . ;] 
:] 
if i wrote a song about soy milk , it would definitely be a love song . <3 ;D 
so . tired . fuck . 
listening to sublime , the shins , and the beatles almost simultaneously . how could that NOT make someone's day ? :] 
i think my hair is forever doomed to smell like bon fire . and for now , i'm perfectly content with that . :] 
give me all your poison , give me all your pills , give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill . you're running after something that you'll never kill ; if this is what you want , then fire at will . 
\there's only one lesson to be learned from life anyway- that there's no lesson to be learned from life . \ " fitzgerald will never fail me . <3 " 
hold your own , know your name , and go your own way , and everything will be fine ...? 
you're so crazy , enough in a way that i'll probably say you destroyed me . 
the used ... they're legit . enough said . :] 
TODAYYY IS A TRAGIC DAYYY ! BUT , only a week before school's over !... and then another year . Dx
