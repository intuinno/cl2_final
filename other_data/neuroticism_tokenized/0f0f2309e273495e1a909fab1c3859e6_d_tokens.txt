N/V , HTN , fever , congestion ... UGHHHH 
So , pretty much , to sum it up : I was given the SQ , and it hurt like a bitch . My arm bled like crazy . And so did my vein-it would not stop bleeding for two freggin minutes . Then my breasts were exposed in the daring cold for 15 minutes . Well , at least I didn't have to get a gluteal !!!!! Ladysss ! I'm still here ! 
Moving to < PROPFIRST > with < PROPFEMALE > Coreas !!! Hell YA ! Free health care , more money , and gov't workers to do your laundry , make dinner , and watch the kids !

Thanks to all the people that actually said Happy Birthday to me . And FUCK YOU ALL to whomever did not . <3 
I still remember those looks and those calls in gym class . I still miss those late phone calls and those early letters in the mail . I wonder what happened . What happened to us ? I remember your tears and mine , when my father made our love a crime . You were hurt and so was I ; or are you just another lie ? You may not see me now , but I see you . It still hurts me that I can't say \I love you too\ " . kkk kkk " 
I hate pediatrics . Nitra !!! I met your < PROPFIRST > last Monday !! Be Jealous ! <3 < PROPFEMALE > , we are so switching externship sites ! <3 Popeyes chicken anyone ?

Dinner for tonight : Raisin Bran cereal with vanilla soy milk , Orange Juice with 110% Vit C , and rice pudding ! Yumm ! lol 
Just got off work . Where the hell is my ride ?? I need to get out of these damn scrubs !! 
Someone rescue me from this perpetual hell you call life . Release me from it's lively grips and set me free into a world of numbness . Give me the death I long for . 
I'm gonna fuck up your relationship . Make her hate you . Make you mine . Destroy everything you ever had with her and laugh in her face . I'll make you forget her , forget who she is , forget how she looks , forget everything . Cause when I'll say her name , you'll think of me . And when we're in bed together , it'll be my name you're screaming . Then , I'll kill her . Why ? Because that's who I am , that's what I do . See you soon . 
I like it in the car .

I've seen a < PROPMALE > man beg , I've seen a good man sin , I've seen a tough guy cry ... I've seen a loser win and a sad mad grin , I've heard an honest man lie ... I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up and everything between . \
