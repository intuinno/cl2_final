I'm telling you I seen , known & even learn what the word weird means , but I have never in my entire life seen nothing like those < PROPMALE > people ! They're just unique , and I can't believe I am going to say this but I like them . Besides , I belong with them , yes with the weird kids ... I am p < PROPMALE > of them and I'm in their field as well . What can I say < PROPMALE > is the new revolution and the key to ambiguity . 
Calculus B midterm , ur going down on FRIDAY !
