I love when God gives you a little nugget of happiness that you wouldn't have even dared to hope for in a million years . He just plops it in your lap . So amazing . 
I want Beyonce to shut up about her boyfriend's halo , well really I just want her to shut up . 
Can't protesters come up with something more original than taking a picture of whoever the current president is and adding a Hitler mustache ? It's been done too much and you just look ridiculous ! Freaks

Some gal in my apts had the nerve to say she doesn't pick up her dog's poop , with ( what she thought I'm sure ) a cute little giggle -- it wasn't cute at all . I wanted to smash her dog's poop in her face . But I didn't , I just gave her a weird look . Man I need to work on my confrontation skills . In the meantime I am visualizing her high heel stabbing into a steamy pile and I believe I may get my wish :) 
I love dorky FB stuff that strokes my ego < PROPFEMALE > is the perfect woman . She has no flaw . She's funny , sweet , smart as hell , and above all , she is extremely gorgeous .

Don't listen to what the other jack-off put . Everybody loves < PROPFEMALE > .

Am I the only one who is scared of the healthcare reform < PROPMALE > ?!??!! I voted for Obama but this is ridiculous ! 
WHY would anyone want to expand the IRS for ANY REASON ???? Are you kidding me , I can't even think about this ridiculousness ( health < PROPMALE > ) it stresses me out ! But I can't help it . What the hell are people thinking seriously !?!?!
