How to remember the 2000's: Military-Industrial Complex , Commercialization , Digitalized Technology , Terrible Mainstream Music , Pluto's not a planet anymore . I believe that makes me a pessimist . I'm sure I'll call these the good old days in 2020 , but until then , here's to the 2010's !! 

baby , it's cold outside . 
has nothing to do , help a brotha out . 
I guess the day wouldn't be complete without someone jumping off a 12 foot fence and spraining both ankles ... 
is having pizza and steak for dinner ... This is quite possibly the happiest day of my life . 
has a working phone ! Text away , kiddies ! 
regrets taking all of those stupid quizzes because he always comes back with 20 new notifications about the same people taking them over and over and over again . 
wants to be like everyone else ... so : BEACH !! 
hopes he turns a nice , toasty < PROPFEMALE > rather than straight pink tomorrow morning ... he was only at the beach for 4 , maybe 5 hours today ... 
hates plateauing ... 
doesn't get people ... I'm going to sleep , dang it . 
hasn't updated his status for a few days , sooo he thinks that Arizona Energy Herbal Tonic is quite the shiz-nit , perhaps even the bees knees ... 
just had the best porterhouse of his life ... 
http://i203.photobucket.com/albums/aa7/buddyc75/jesusPSP.gif you know you want it ... 
wtf ?! Now < PROPMALE > McNair is dead ?!!?! 
got 99th percentile on the Science section of the ACT ... I'm so confused ... 
listened to all of Breaking < PROPMALE>'s songs today and found half to be really good , and half just silly , hahaha . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > + < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > + < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > = < PROPFIRST > Jacobs + < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > + < PROPMALE > Bradshaw . 
is back , kiddies . 
wonders what he did that is scaring off so many people ... maybe it's the beard . 
Felt like starting up a Fantasy Football league , so if you got an e-mail , don't freak out . If you didn't and want to play , holler at me and I'll put you in . 
mmm ... skittles ... Nature's aphrodisiac ... wait ... 
whole bag of hot fries . gone . who needs fiber when you got spicy food ? 
RIP my gallon jug of Arizona Tea . July 22nd , 2009 - July 22nd , 2009 . 
I woke up on the wrong side of my head . 
is as far to the bottom as could be , and he's gonna make his way up , all the way , all by hisself . 
RIP < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
screw you < PROPFIRST > Shapiro . 
work til 11 , sneak in a text if you want . 
feels dirty after listening to the END , didn't know the Black Eyed Peas would sellout so badly . 
looks too old to be in high school ... apparently ... 
I guess 190 pounds puts you on the line ... 
right guard ... me ? really ? 
there's your answer . 
facebook's acting up , don't hold me accountable . 
can a brother get a blitz ? 
is chilling with the Kubo . 
just got accepted for post secondary at CSU ... no sweat < PROPMALE > State , you're only forcing me to arrange everything for the next 10 months in 8 days ... 
doesn't dislike < PROPFIRST > Favre for coming back , he just dislikes the fact that he has retired and unretired for a whole freaking decade now ... and that the Browns will play him in Week 1 . 
loves being the g . 
lunch 8/21 : chicken , pizza , grapes , tangerine , pb&j , potato salad and hot fries ... what ?! I was hungry ! 
had a good game . 2 days of rest then back to the grind . 
YES !! Go < PROPFIRST > Bartel !! 
is so relieved that he didn't take a math this year . 
south shoreline , oil , cars , canned food , gray snow , darkness and light , fire , christian themes , blood splatter , oil , evil winning , revolver , 2 bullets , water , little boy as jesus , moral code and civilization out the window , trees and forests , nuclear winter , coca cola , parka , phone dialing ... Did I miss anything I could illustrate ? 
chilling with the kubo for one last night ... tomorrow's gonna suck . 
wonders why little league baseball has completely taken over ESPN . BTW , how do you login into moodle ? Nothing I try works . 
1-0 . Maybe the marching band shouldn't be at games more often . 
Good job girls volleyball , but on to more pressing matters ... How the hell do you play a musical instrument in two and a half over four time ?! 
is killing the kubo at some ncaa 10 . He's tried to fake 6 punts and has run the option about three dozen times already ... pff ... college football , what a joke . 
Browns ' Offensive Line is screwed . 
burgers for lunch , steak for dinner , leftovers for dinner tomorrow ... SWEET !! 
SONIC !! Good job spilling your tots < PROPFIRST > ...

< PROPFIRST > Moss disappoints me . 
biiiiiiiiiiig mistake .

we have a football game here kiddies . 
just looked at his e-mail inbox for the first time in a couple weeks and would like to request that the college board QUIT JOCKING HIS NUTS . Sending me 10 e-mails won't convince me to go to some university out in Wyoming . 
hopes everyone did good on their SATs . Gonna rest for a minute because film was torturous , clean the room , college crap , homework , college crap , more homework , college , college , homework and trying to make some plans for after 4 , hit me up . 
you know how you get into Carnegie hall , don't you ? Practice .

the < PROPMALE > Browns ' defense was trying to play either grabass or flag football against the Steelers .... not sure which one ... 
wing night with the crew and extended crew , peeace . 
Pacer's needs a wing flavor hotter than their extra hot . In unrelated news , < PROPFIRST > Vazquez is a pussy . 
is about to wake up deathly sick tomorrow , I can feel it . There's no reason why I should be this tired , this sore and this cold , especially on the first day above 70 degrees since August . 
who called it ? 
caught the swiny . See you all in two weeks . 
might be back Wednesday , thank you to everyone who left something on my wall . 
no facebook , I refuse to poke < PROPFIRST > Danger Occhionero ... ya know ... unless he wants me to ... 
This Just In : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wvUIVu_6U8&feature=related 
If < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > just spiked the ball into the dirt every time he dropped back to pass , his QB rating would be 39.6 ... < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s current QB rating for the 2009 season : 36.2 . 
knows < PROPFEMALE > Flip won't respect me in the morning if I don't ... so Go < PROPMALE > !! 
... am I really fiesty ? 
really has to wonder what kind of trash is going around about him when < PROPFEMALE > Donahoe suspects him of lacing his powerbars with anabolic steroids ... 
' s Zune froze , so he is now in a perpetual world of < PROPFIRST > Coltrane ... it's much nicer actually . 
+ Buca Di Beppo's = <3

We finally wiped that smile off of Hines < PROPMALE>'s face : http://www.thebrownsdominate.com/modules/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=65&g2_serialNumber=1 
just when I think I'm in the clear as far as college mail goes , I remember that my SAT scores just went out a week ago . Ouch .

< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 47 FANTASY POINTS . BOOM BABY !!

had fun last night ( waiting for < PROPFEMALE > Donahoe to respond ) . 
damn you all , 99 notifications ?! really ?! 
gah , 46 notifications this time . 
so when I finally got home from my Grandma's , a bag on my bed greeted me with 10 bags of Hot Fries ... My mom knows me too well . 
I'm getting good at doing things the < PROPMALE > Melnyk way . You sit down , you say \game time\ " and get shit done . - < PROPMALE > Rodriguez " 
Winter Break is over , now begins the longest 5 month span of my life ...

let's go Cowboys !! 
3 for 3 with colleges . Now he just needs some funds from OSU . 
boudi . 
hopes there's a 40% curve on the AP English 12 midterm . Who actually believes they're getting better than a C+ on that ? 
owns the Zune of GOD . 
was just swindled into two dates by a best friend . This might have been good had it not been by < PROPFIRST > Kubovcik , and instead , you know , a girl maybe ? 
can I kick it ? 
don't eat no ham n ' eggs , cuz they're high in cholesterol . 
is too distracted by Instinctive Travels , Facebook and Paths of Rhythm to focus on AP Physics , so the computer is getting turned off . Goodnight all . 
Senioritis . noun . A crippling disease that strikes high school seniors . Symptoms include : laziness , an over-excessive wearing of track pants , old athletic shirts , sweatpants , athletic shorts , and sweatshirts . Also features a lack of studying , repeated absences , and a generally dismissive attitude . The only known cure is a phenomenon known as Graduation . 
OK , you two are getting incredibly annoying , my news feed is completely clogged up with both of you saying the same exact things over and over . Call each other or text or something . You know who you are . 
come on FAFSA , J . Rocke needs some funds . 
is feeling quite swole . 
Discographies just downloaded : Killswitch , Nas , Naughty By Nature , RATM , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . There's my music taste for you . 
Sinbad is hilarious . 
needs April to get here soon . 
ID3 tags are the most annoying things ever . 
Looking out for my boy takes a higher priority over some frosh-fest and post-frosh-fest festivities . Hope you guys are still having fun though . 
after 7 hours of work , 2 domino's pizzas , a stop at Walgreen's , two Arizona teas , Zach and Miri and the Big Lebowski ... the H.M.S. Mo'Dick hath been assembled . 
February's over now , can I please take down this picture of < PROPFIRST > Gere ?

NFL free agency has begun ! I can finally dig my out of this hole of depression in which ESPN shows nothing but basketball ! 
is sick . My post-swine-flu-super-charged-immune-system couldn't last forever ... 
The Browns just traded for Seneca < PROPMALE > . I see where Holmgren is going . Now , we trade < PROPFIRST > away , cut < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , trade for < PROPFIRST > Smith and < PROPFIRST > Vick and then draft < PROPMALE > Tebow . Then , have all four of them plus Cribbs on the field at the same time and run our offense exclusively out of the wildcat . 
would like to wake up illness free tomorrow , let's hope < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Eash's miracle concoction work its magic !! 
may have stumbled upon the meaning of life . The fact that he may have stumbled upon the meaning of life AT TWO AM makes it's credibility a little questionable , however . 
oh , so this is how it feels to wear shorts ? 
lordy loo the Road is a slow movie . 
If you're told that you're in denial , how do you argue back ? 
Holmgren has some explaining to do . Signed Delhomme , < PROPFIRST > to Broncos , Wimbley to Raiders ? 
With Bumpers : Kubo - 134 , Westy - 107 , Rocke - 83 . Without Bumpers : Kubo - 103 , Westy - 68 , Rocke - 143 . 
Just cleaned out his binders and notebooks . I would like to take this moment to apologize to the environmentalists out there for the two forests I must have killed while taking AP English , Sociology , AP Physics and AP Government .

oh , so THAT's how it feels to get over the head with a load of bricks . 
Frederik Groce , < PROPMALE > Melnyk , < PROPMALE > Colvin : Black in Blood , Black in Practice and ... < PROPMALE > . 
strike three , and I'm out of luck . 
is going through his old iPod 5G and reminiscing over the old music . Does anyone know a good way to salvage the music off of this thing ? 
just pimped iTunes to get his old music library off his old iPod . 
Great ... As if I didn't had to look after < PROPFIRST > enough already , he got a double dose of emotional baggage today . 
is not supposed to be within two hundred feet of a school ... or a < PROPMALE > E . Cheese . 
off to bed , getting up at 5:30 for an 8 hour drive to < PROPFEMALE > . w00t . 
So this is what it is like to be completely relaxed ? I like . 
Oh , and vacation was awesome , sorry if I didn't respond to texts and calls , phone died on Saturday . 
since the other 3 Melnyk cousins feel the need to post about themselves going running , I think I will go ... lifting . 
Just call me \China Guito Dude . \"" 
< PROPMALE > Roethlisberger is officially a complete slimeball . I really hope Goodell has the cojones to suspend him for an entire year . 
just tried listening to Lady Gaga for the first time . It didn't go well . 
The Browns obviously drafted < PROPFIRST > Haden to bring back the Brownie elf as the official logo . See the resemblance ? http://thebrownsboard.com/images1/BROWNIE.jpg http://media.scout.com/Media/Image/33/331038.jpg 
Between the Buried and Me , Canned Heat , RL Burnside . You know you love my music taste .

going out to scare some kids . 
what a week ... 
Today I didn't even have to use my AK , I got to say it was a good day . 
I miss my zune . I'll just have to find another way to fall asleep I guess ... 
damn you facebook chat . 
would REALLY like for this one to work out . 
as the great Puff Daddy once said , vote or die kiddies ! 
Re-realizing how much he hates The < PROPFEMALE > Letter . 
is reviewing literary terms for the test tomorrow . This will hopefully be the last time I ever have to use Moodle again . 
well , I'd call that a good evening . 
AP Physics test was possibly the most impossible test I have ever taken in my life . At least it's all over meow . 
how is one to react when they are told that they should be doused in < PROPFEMALE > , covered in fuzzy material and immediately hugged because they look cuddly ? 
I was told today that getting hugged by me is like getting hugged by a brick wall ... 
just heard someone use the term \Mean Muggin'\ " in context . Don't mess with skinny 8th graders in wifebeaters ! " 
got his 6th grade letter like the rest , and thinks we should have a Fassett/Expo class reunion . Who's gonna pay for Mathias < PROPMALE > Hansen's ticket back from Denmark ? 
got his 6th grade letter like the rest , and thinks we should have a Fassett/Exoo class reunion . Who's gonna pay for Mathias < PROPMALE > Hansen ' s ticket back from Denmark ? 
is listening to the new Black Keys album . 
is confident in his bridge design . 
is going through August Burns Red's discography again , they sound much better this time . 
a lot to handle this early on , but I'll make it work . 
is contemplating the idea of putting a prom picture as my profile picture . However , I'm not sure if the picture of me fishing on the river is more representative of my humble nature . 
is tired of wasting his time and effort , it's time to have some fun . 
Top thrill dragster , you unreliable bastard !! 
Great way to kick off the Summer , I know this one is gonna be good . 
What is this ?! I broke triple digits in tagged photos ?! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s a bitch , but treat her well and she pays . 
I love how I will always end up forcing myself to like songs by an artist , but right now , it's a challenge to find a song by Avenged Sevenfold that I don't like . 
< PROPFIRST > Kubovcik is in love with Little Big Planet right now . 
has a voice somewhere inbetween Fergie and Jesus . 
If you have one or two extra commencement tickets that you could give away , please call me , text me or leave me a message . Thanks . 
would like to revise his previously made comments about Avenged Sevenfold . They would be my favorite if they would actually follow through on their songs !! 
This is ridiculous . I have at least 10 applications out there that I've checked back on , but no calls back . Can anyone refer me somewhere that might ACTUALLY be hiring ? 
trying to free my boy . 
finished strong with a 4.4 GPA for his last ever quarter of high school . 
is watching Man vs Food at the Melt and is really tempted to take on the Melt Challenge ... too bad I'm not the biggest fan of cheese . 
just got back from orientation , and CSU is going to be awesome . I don't think I've ever been this excited in my life . All of my AP classes and my ACT scores cut out 6 classes and I'm set to double < PROPMALE > in Chemical Engineering and Political Science while working c o-o p over 5 years . The area is amazing and I met a future best friend too . This is gonna be good . 
Oh Yes . \

Real fun night tonight , I'm really starting to like this . 
Life isn't fair , but it would really suck if it was . 
Grad Party is now on the 10th , sorry for the change , hope you can still come . 
The same old shit is still going wrong , but at least the fresh new shit is going right . 
definitely did not go to the fireworks , but , instead , sat on the back porch with my elder neighbors talking about politics , economics , healthcare , the city of < PROPMALE > , jobs , engineering , the old days of our youth when we all blew up things with < PROPFEMALE > bombs and life in general for about 6 hours . It's official , I'm 40 years old . You guys need to take me out more . 
Learning how to play this damn thing might be the end of me . 
still hates < PROPMALE > Modell the most , but LeBron < PROPFIRST > now beats out < PROPFIRST > Dolan for second place on my most hated < PROPMALE > Sports-related figures . 
Wow , Kobe really IS better !! It's all so clear to me now ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is the man . \

Laptop is ordered . For those who still need to get one , let me know , I got a great deal at < PROPFEMALE>'s Online Outlet Store and can help you out . 
Women : You can't live without them , and they can't pee standing up . 
the allergies that I never had before are going wild !! 
got his new laptop today . Now begins the tedious task of having the Zune software on THIS computer recognize all the music on the OTHER computer . 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Hila , but Frederik Groce ... not so much . 
\wait ... watch my pawn hump the end of the board \"" 
just spent 8 hours hauling furniture and boxes . < PROPMALE > Rodriguez , you better love me for this . 
needs to re-graduate high school to throw another grad party that Hallah Amawi will come to . Does this mean I'm gonna play freshman football this fall ? 
I want to document everyone's Jungian personalties now , it's so interesting and accurate . 
This weekend is gonna be crazy . 
Who else has Skype ? Frederik Groce gets pretty boring to talk to after a while =p 
Is anyone else randomly going to Cedar Point tomorrow ? 
I just tried watching Jersey Shore ... that lasted a full 10 minutes . 
I'm just next to the right field foul poll . If a ball comes towards me I'm going to try as hard as I can to make it onto sportscenter . 
Today I learned to ALWAYS wear a shirt while making Philly Cheesesteaks . 
[ Insert emotional , pissed off , possibly poetic message here . ] 
I won't jinx it . 
Last week before college ... This is going to be the longest freaking week ever . Someone help me pass the time . 
Can I get a hot tub ?! 
25 applications in , and I FINALLY have a job .

Last weekend before college . If we have yet to adequately chill , you best get to chilling with me . Give me some plans . 
Needs more friends who don't work 50 hours a week . 
Second day was much better than the first . 
Yeah , this whole college thing is going to be fun . The sky is the limit right now . 
has been out all day and JUST got home at 12:30 . \ 
Today was a good day . 
Well , at least I got a new story to tell out of it all . What a night , hahahahah . 
I love the fact that I am wearing a hoodie and jeans right now . 
Calculus , my old enemy , you make less sense now than you did 2 years ago . 
Studying . Distractions are welcomed . 
My best friend is off to < PROPMALE > , and all I have to remember him by is this damn beer mug . Thanks < PROPMALE > . 
= < PROPMALE > Allen\ 
< PROPFIRST > Hyland = < PROPMALE > Cribbs\ 
< PROPMALE > Caja = < PROPFIRST > Brees\ 
I'm feeling an all-pro team right here . 
When the highest scoring player on your fantasy football team is your KICKER , you know you has problems . 
< PROPFIRST > Colbert is doing a spoof of Dr. Strangelove . It is very sad how happy that makes me . 
< PROPMALE > Caja is my bromate . Woot for chemistry humor !! 
GTL ? Nah , more like SGW : School , Gym , Work . Get Educated , Get Swoll , Get Money . 
would rather not do homework right now , someone hit me up with plans . 
Who should I play ? Hakeem Nicks or < PROPFIRST > Collie ? 
Dear Calculus , I hate your stinking guts . I'm going to sleep . SGW tomorrow . 
All work and getting paid better make < PROPMALE > a < PROPMALE > boy . 
Team J . Rocke vs Team Immigrants . This should be a good game . 
I guess < PROPFIRST > Vick was a good waiver pickup then ... 
Is finally looking to upgrade his whole phone situation . Who's an expert that can help me out ? 
LeBron < PROPFIRST > is complaining that Race played a factor in the backlash against him after \The Decision\ " . Yeah 
Freshman fifteen my ass , I've lost ten pounds so far ! 
Today needs to end so I can enjoy my three days off . Who wants to < PROPFEMALE > ? 
If I didn't have < PROPFIRST > Ohio Maryo at work , I would've gone insane by now . Happy birthday < PROPMALE > , you sexy son of a bitch ! 
I just got home from work , and I even if I HAD the time to watch enough TV to figure out what ridiculous show prompted everyone to post their favorite location to do the dirty , I probably still would be clueless . Goodnight to you all . 
Work ' til midnight then chemistry lab report . Peace . 
finished his 8-page Chemistry Lab Report before midnight . Suck it , < PROPMALE > Caja . 
got shot down for Sweetest Day . Ah well , today's still gonna be fun . 
Fuck < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !! Two helme t-t o-helmet hits , two Browns injured , no penalties . 
TJ Ward : Knock Roethlisberger's head off and all of < PROPMALE > will chip in to pay your fine !! 
A deep gash in my hand from work is keeping me out of football today , time to catch up with some people and some homework . 
Just wrote a paper on Diversity for my Intro to University Life Class . It made me miss RAD ... besides that whole getting screwed out of meeting Obama and spending a week in DC ... thing . 
Team Melnyk vs Team Groce this week . Really , it's Team Melnyk vs Team Melnyk , but what the hell ? 
Highlight of my day : Skyping with Ingveig Habbestad during English 102H ... 
was a walkin ' home from work at 1:30 in the morning on a Friday night and wouldn't you know it ? The line of cars for Taco < PROPFEMALE>'s drive-through was spilling out onto Detroit . smh 
No idea what we're going to be doing tonight , but it should be fun ... although last time I said that we ended up marooned in < PROPMALE > Heights . 
Because I refuse to back down from a challenge by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ocilka ... \ 
Like my status & I'll tell you :\ 
1 . Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds , \ 
2 . The color you remind me of , \ 
3 . My first memory of you , \ 
4 . The animal you remind me of , \ 
5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you , \ 
6 . My favorite thing about you , \ 
7 . Give you a weird nickname , \ 
8 . Challenge you to post this . 
I guess I'm the only one of my friends that knows how to cross streets ... 
For once , < PROPMALE > will be on ESPN for something positive . Go Browns ! 
My Team Melnyk defeats Frederik Groce's Team Melnyk . OH YEA-EA-EAH !! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > - \Remember all those stories I told you about being the token black kid in my class ? \ " \ 
< PROPFIRST > Blake : < PROPMALE > , you're so cold ! \ 
< PROPMALE > Melnyk : It's why you love me . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Blake : It IS why I love you , it's sad ! \ 
For those keeping score , I'm still not coming off as cuddly and warm as I'd like to be . 
Bring on the Jets . We've found our Quarterback and our Runningback . 
So sad ... http://www.salary-money.com/Jared-salary-10629.php 
With Yoey Feigenbaum and < PROPFEMALE > Sušinskas as my witnesses , I can chug a can of Coco-Cola in 8 seconds ... from one of the cans we're using to test for aluminum leeching ( and poisoning ) into liquids ... O.O 
Does anyone have any previous experience with Virgin Mobile ? I know their internet is a little unreliable , but if thats the only hitch , $25 a month is too good to pass up . 
< PROPFIRST > Vick : 48 fantasy points and climbing . He might outscore Ivor Karabatkovic all by hisself . 
So the car I test drove today was absolutely terrible . Going back to scouring craigslist and autotrader and bluebook and cars.com, hopefully I will be mobile by Saturday . 
It's time to play with my little cousins , catch up with the fam and enjoy turkey leftovers for a week . Happy Thanksgiving everybody . 
Thanksgiving dinner was delicious . Seconds were even better . Thirds weren't as good as Seconds , but still great . Resisting Fourths was tough . Then the five pies were amazing . Then resisting Seconds on the pies was even rougher . \ 
I'm very thankful for my family ( of great cooks ) . 
is feeling inspired . 
\The way I see it 
Finals are coming up , I have to do perfect in Calculus from this point on for a grade I deem acceptable , my chemistry experiment is constantly being held up by profs that are supposed to help our group since I just don't happen to know how to run an ICP spectrometer , four more chapters of Chemistry Homework to do as well , and I'm going to get the Copley Medal awarded to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > too ... \ 
No big , I got this . 
Now I can't figure out who is who because everyone is either a cartoon character , a Pokemon or , in < PROPFEMALE > Jawhari's case , a grumpy Jewish cat . 
Apparently , this years string of swine flue has hit , and instead of getting everybody dreadfully sick , it has transformed all the infected into some sort of cartoon character . I'm happy I got vaccinated . 
No complaining about the new Facebook profiles or my associate and I will < PROPMALE > dirty cowboy boots , come over to your house and put our feet up on your white , suede couch ... and by my associate , I of course mean < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
It may have been because I was listening to them while I was more angry than I've ever been in ... years ? Yeah , years ... but Unearth is freaking awesome . 
Back to square one . 
Decembeard ? 
Crunch Time . 
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but not to their own facts - < PROPFIRST > Moynihan . 
To all ASC 101S students : I e-mailed the honors program asking about class next week with < PROPFIRST > being on extended leave and they said that we will have class with there to collect our essays and administer course evaluations next Tuesday . 
Reason #45 to like the New Facebook layout : It immediately made me aware upon adding Jaco Jucutan as a friend that he also likes the Blue Scholars , automatically making him the coolest person I've met at CSU . 
Always bank on your own game ... The one-liners < PROPFIRST > Ohio Maryo and I come up with at work ! Hahaha . 
Wrong person to mess with ... 
December 23rd : Pumped for Christmas and to see my family ! \ 
December 24th : Wake up sick as hell ... \ 
December 25th : Still sick as hell , lost 8 pounds of body weight ... \ 
December 26th : Finally recovering , but still had a great Christmas ! \ 
December 27th : Getting the wisdom teeth pulled ... \ 
I'm thinking that tomorrow would be a good day FOR YOU to message and/or Skype me , I'm going to be loopy out of my mind . 
FINALLY BOUGHT A CAR . 
I finally got the grade I deserved . 3.76 GPA for the semester . 
You have your way . I have my way . As for the right way , the correct way , and the only way , it does not exist . 
Heading to work . Last week before school starts , I'm free pretty much everyday so hit me up . 
I'm going to drive my advisor crazy when I get back to school , haha . 
Always be thankful for what you have , you could easily have it so much worse . Always be ready for opportunities , you could easily have it so much better . 
I'm back at CSU , and once again , I feel like the token straight , white dude . 
It's time to see what I'm capable of . 
So this weekend was definitely a good one . Thank you to everyone that was a part of it . 
E.S. Posthumus . Yes . 
For some reason , I have the strange urge to wear a block of cheese on my head as a hat today . Go Packers !! 
I am pleasantly surprised at how fun tonight was . 
I'm learning that all things , good or bad , always happen when you least expect them ... so I'll continue to be prepared for anything , and continue to be thankful that , for once , more good things are happening than bad . 
Happy ValentineZ Day . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Juniewicz and Frederik Groce , as much as I like being Ingveig Habbestad's favorite person in the States , I think you should talk to her more often . And < PROPFEMALE > , I think you should start talking to me more often too , it's only been 7 months . 
Dear < PROPMALE > State University , every outdoor surface in Lakewood is encased in an inch of ice . Please call or e-mail back before 4am . Love , < PROPMALE > ... XOXOXO 
So , let me get this straight ... < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE . Yet , the idea is that same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post to your < PROPFEMALE > if you are proud to support equal rights for ALL ! 
Team < PROPMALE > , Yoey Feigenbaum and the Yoey-ettes set a new record today at CSU . Go team ! 
Playlist on repeat :\

Alright snow , it's March . Your job is done , now stop falling . 
This is the last time I take 6 classes in one semester . 
I had almost forgotten how much of a badass dude < PROPMALE > Nunnari is . Almost . 
Spring Break begins early because of a Snow Day ... Talk about a mixed blessing . \ 
On a much more dire note , prayers go out to Japan . If you are in Hawaii or on the Pacific Coast and can read this , get to high ground ! 
Bored out of my mind , some Spring Break this is turning out to be ... 
Kiss me , I'm Ukrainian . 
Due to a stupid mistake made on my calculus test , I will now forever associate integration by parts with trigonometric substitution . Woo ! I sound like I actually know what I'm talking about ! 
Two midterms the day after Spring Break is one hell of a way to kick my ass back into gear ! 
Who the hell designs a chemistry lab that doesn't account for converting between mL and L ? 
The answer for #1 is [ 9.5 (arcsin(-1/6)+2pi)-6cos(arcsin(-1/6)+2pi)- 4.5 sin(2(arcsin(-1/6)+2pi))]-[ 9.5 (-arcsin(-1/6)+pi)-6cos(-arcsin(-1/6)+pi)- 4.5 sin(2(-arcsin(-1/6)+pi ))] . \ 
Calculus II <3 
I'm not happy , I'm feeling glad , I've got quail , in a bag ... 
To my fellow CSU Engineering Peeps : How good are professors Baykut and Tewari ? 
Five full-speed engineering classes next fall ? Psh , I got this . 
Pantry ? 
One must complete 132 credit hours worth of classes to get a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering at < PROPMALE > State University . In comparison , with 132 credits to work with , one could also quadruple < PROPMALE > in Philosophy , Political Science , History and Sociology . \ 
It is now safe to say that I am currently re-considering my < PROPMALE > . 
Apparently I occasionally speak in a Southern drawl , so I'm just going to start telling people that I'm from ' nawlins . 
I wear the blisters I get from using two knives in one hand to chop up herbs as medals of achievement . I love my job . 
I , < PROPMALE > , love < PROPFEMALE > Bartosh . Because she is the coolest girl on the planet . 
I have two words for my Chemistry Final and American Chemical Society Tests :\ 
Game Time .
