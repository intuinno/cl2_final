Now , I want to buy $20 game to go along with it . I cannot decide between Amnesia : The Dark Descent , Team Fortress 2 , or Minecraft . Amnesia and Minecraft are favorable . Which game should I choose or should I choose none of them ? 
That tears it , I gotta play Amnesia after playing the demo . > w < \
