Has a Missing Wing , and doesn't feel complete . 
And as we walk on down the road . \ 
Our shadows taller than our souls . \ 
There walks a lady we all know . \ 
Who shines white light and wants to show . \ 
How everything still turns to gold . \ 
And if you listen very hard . \ 
The truth will come to you at last . \ 
When all is one and one is all . \ 
To be . A rock , and not to roll . \ 
... \ 
And she's buying , a stairway . \ 
To Heaven . 
Doesn't have a phone now , but he doesn't care . Why ? Because he gets to see her tommorow . <3

There she stood in the doorway ;\ 
I heard the mission bell\ 
And I was thinking to myself , \ 
’this could be heaven or this could be hell’\ 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way\ 
There were voices down the corridor , \ 
I thought I heard them say ... 
If I could wake up in a different place , at a different time , could I wake up as a different person ?

We listen to the tales and romanticize , \ 
How we follow the path of the hero \ 
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun , \ 
How we'll rise to the height of our halo . \ 
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize \ 
Our way into the arms of the savior \ 
Fading all the trials and the tribulations , \ 
None of us have actually been there , \ 
Not like you ... 
Needs to know which song is better , for a freind . \ 
The Verve- \Bittersweet Symphony\ " \

We`re the middle children of history , man . No purpose or place . We have no Great War . No Great Depression . Our Great War`s a spiritual war ... our Great Depression is our lives . 
\But if you caught on fire 
Knows that the function of music is to release us from the tyranny of conscious thought . 
Missed her the whole time he was gone . 
Misses when the world knew what music was . 
Is very glad he got to see Angel < PROPFEMALE > tonight . :D ILYA <3 
Eyes Hurt . Bed Calling . Ehhh .. Maybe one more Song .. 
\The time I burned my guitar it was like a sacrifice . You sacrifice the things you love . I love my guitar . \""

Wants to listen to some \Smashmouth\ " . Thanks Einstein Quick .... " 
Spent the last 2 hours making a 5 foot leaf pile with his brother . It was demolished in about .. A Minute ? Lesson learned : Your never to old for childish things . \ 
In other news he's missed Angel all day . And loves her tons :D 
Loves the Storm :D 
Stripped his guitar , and is ready for some new strings . However , he is also ready for bed . Night Night . 
“Then , out of nowhere , a flock of birds flew by the window , extremely fast and incredibly close . Maybe twenty of them . Maybe more . But they also seemed like just one bird , because somehow they all knew exactly what to do . ” 
Hopes all of you are having a good Thanksgiving . I am thankful for good Music . 
Has lately noticed that quite a a bit of songs I tend to relate to the thought of \Nostalgic Music\ " has been coming from Led Zeppelin . " 
And no one called us to the land . \ 
And no one knows the wheres or whys . \ 
Something stirs and something tries . \ 
Starts to climb toward the light . \ 
\Echoes\ " before bed . Hell Yes . " 
Loves her more than the need to breathe , sleep , and think . :) 
Ended up taking a picture with a Black guy with an awesome ' Fro in Wallmart . \ 
Hell Yes . \ 
He is now listining to Pink Floyd . \ 
And in other news , he loves her loads <3 \ 
Full Night . 
Formal = Dressing Up . \ 
Dressing Up = Bleah . 
Knows that you can join the millions talking in the Dark , \ 
Or you can stand up and scream light , out into the night . 
\No reason to get excited\ " \ 
New Phone , Hell Yes . 417-719-2893 
( Mom watching How the Grinch stole Christmas . )\ 
\What a *******!!\"" 
Loves her Loves her Loves her , And Enjoyed spending the past two days with her :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !! :D 
Is about to kick some combine ass on Half Life 2 , Hell yeah . 
Is begining to wonder how good that corn that was set out for 6 hours really is . 
Rugrats and Nachos :D 
Just called Greenland ..? 
< PROPFEMALE > TUESDAYS I THINK YES . 
And the more and more I tend to listen to music , the more and more it seems to take control of me . Rhythm becomes in sync with heart pulse , My brain projecting images at me that I've never even seen before . And it seems that all I can do is wait patiently for the song to be over . 
Needs more songs for his Ipod , because the 2130 he has at the moment is simply not enough . 
Found his headphones ! :D 
Happy 9 months Angel :) I love you ! 
Has had his phone for 2 Days over a month now , and already managed to break it . :( 
( Me Taking NWEA Testing . )\ 
Question 17 : \Why Did the Mother Cat lose her Black Kitten ? \ " \

Is presumably about to spend an epic/nostalgic weekend with Einstein Quick . 
BlizzardBlizzardBlizzard :D 
Thinks the snow blowing around looks like ants marching thousands and thousands of < PROPMALE > over dunes . \ 
In other news he really needs some hot chocolate . 
Assumed for some reason that the Super bowl would be on . Despite the fact that I really don't care for Football . Until I heard \The Legendary Pokemon are doing THAT ?! \ " From the other room . \
