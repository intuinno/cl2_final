PANCAKE TUESDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Pancake Tuesday ! ( For those of you who don't understand , think crepes galore ) 
Just spent over 1 1/2 hours visiting my neighbour's elderly cat which is deaf , super skinny and ADORABLE . 
Isn't it so weird when you find someone on Facebook and they haven't changed A BIT in those 6 years ?? 
<3 s her exchange student . Worst part ? French class is going to be SO embarrassing- she's practically fluent in English ! 
Holton Girls : What are you all doing during Period 5 tomorrow ? I'm taking a History quiz during that period , and < PROPFEMALE > ( my french exchange student ) will have nothing to do all period .

Sitting in Atlanta airport waiting for my flight ....

Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone !! ( i feel so loved ;) ) 
Of COURSE I would lose the USB on the one night that I really need it ... 
SO bored of studying ... 
Computer is currently freaking out , saying it has a virus . Currently I'm running the quick scan and saving EVERYTHING to a flash disk . 
Turns out I'll have to take this computer to IT tomorrow- I can't fix it and there's all this random stuff popping up .... about 17 different types of antiviruses ( some real and some fake ) and somehow a porn site just popped up .... 
Made it all the way to < PROPFEMALE > in one piece ! Got about 1 hr of sleep , which is making this french keyboard much harder to navigate .... for example , it took me several minutes to find the full stop button , and every time I write an a , q , z , w , or m I have to delete it because the wrong letter shows up ! 
Apparently all of the apples around < PROPFIRST > taste and feel exactly like pears , but they're not pears because everyone calls them apples and they look like apples ... 
has sore feet from walking around < PROPFIRST > all day ... 
1am : Just got back to the house after returning everyone to their respective homes , after the amazing production we saw of < PROPMALE > Miserables 
this is the life : sitting in a cafe overloking the Seine in the evening , with Notre Dame and french music playing in the background while eating sorbet . 
you know you're in < PROPFIRST > when you see 5 smart cars squished into 2 normal parking spaces ... 
fireworks @ the capitol , then sparklers at home :) 
just back from a full day of whitewater tubing with < PROPFIRST > O'byrne (: D ) but now is crispy fried all over my arms and legs :( ... 
New York @ 4:07 am : was woken up by a large electronic beep , then a voice telling us that they are ' checking on the fire alarm we just heard ' . 4:09 am : 7 fire truck stop outside our hotel . 4:11 am : proper fire alarm goes off and everybody grabs essentials , heading for the door . 4:15 am : we travel down 15 flights of stairs to be told that it's a false alarm . :D all in a morning's work ... @ < PROPFIRST > O'Byrne 
loves VIP CA calls from RBC :D :D 
home from camp :) 
no power for past 25 hours , with no idea when it will come back ...................

GOT INTO RBC HUP 2011 . ( finally ) 
internet's been gone 2 days now . Have resorted to sitting in a corner beside a drafty window to steal internet off the neighbours .... 
I have to say- I absolutely love being in Ireland . Everybody is just so nice . Example : random car gets stuck in the snow at a stoplight . Instantaneously , half a dozen men between the ages of 12 and 90 jump out of their cars and start to help push it out of the snow . When the car finally gets out , everyone congratulates each other and drive off without a second thought . <3 
I think that the history teachers ACTUALLY want to kill us . 
History exam :O 
Turns out that if a human was as fat as my cat , they would weigh 250 pounds . I don't think that diet's working quite the way it's supposed to .... 
NO SCHOOL . 
Five head government officials resigning in Ireland .... implosion time O.o 
snowing again 
Why , oh why , did I decide to be a good student and do my homework during/right after school yesterday and then leave almost all my books at school ??? 
Watching Modern Marvels on the History Channel for her friday evening .... :D 
Eating green tea < PROPFEMALE > Kats that Dad brought back from Japan .... :D 
In France .... \ 
-There is no Norway\ 
-There are only 5 continents\
