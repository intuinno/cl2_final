Reaching your head w/ the cold and sudden fury of a divine messenger Let me tell you about heartache & the loss of God Wondering , wondering in hopeless night 
time needs to slow the fuck down . it doesn't seem like years have passed , but minutes . 
Metamorphose . An object is cut off from it's name , habbits , associations . Detatched , it becomes only the thing , in and of itself . When this disintegration into pure existence is at last achieved , the object is free to become endlessly anything . 
why do we kill people , who kill people , to show that killing people is wrong ? 
having a root canal wednesday . yay . 
if i was a flower growin wild and free . . . 
Hold your head up high . . . and blow your brains out 
I been thinkin about you your records are here your eyes are on my wall your teeth are over there 
just to let everyone know I LOVE SMOKING ! I hate the \no smoking\ " in restaurants and I will seriously be PISSED if it becomes a law that I can't even smoke in my car . " 
Spartacus fuckin rules ! 
so much I want to do but no time to do it . gir . 
and does anyone want to buy me windshield wipers ? cuz that'd be great 
< PROPMALE > DADDY GONNA MAKE YOU WANNA 
Well hello UTI . Lovely to wake up to you this morning :/ 
this turned out to be really a most excellent day 
Six years ago today , I can't believe it's been that long . 
Had my teeth cleaned today at 4pm . They still frikin hurt . Goodnight FB . 
thanks fuckin god it's FRIDAY ! 
okay so 23 has got to be one of the most confusing years of my life . 
Had an awesome weekend and prayed to god I wouldn't run out of gas on the way home :) 
Fuckin Mondays man . My head hurts . My stomach hurts . I don't want to go to work . I just want to lay in bed all day and watch movies with my dustinator :) 
Twilight got nine Razzies nominations . Who would have thought !? lol 
please don't snow again please don't snow again please don't snow again ! 
I LOVE YOU SUN ! It's really nice to see you ! Oh won't you please stay a while ? 
I slept a total of one hour before being awakened , not needlessly though , at three in the morning ; so now I am going back to sleep ! :) 
I know sending my daughter to private school is a way better environment for her and will most definitely keep her safe during the day while I am at work BUT they have no many gd activities I can't keep up ! I always miss or mess up something ! It makes me feel like Shit ! 
So ready for tomorrow 
the weather hates me ! agh ! 
Sometimes I look back at my life , and the crap I did and I'm like , \what the fuck was I thinking ? What in the world could have been going through my mind to do THAT ?! \ " lol " 
and I won't just let it go , cuz I don't believe what I used to know . . .

The weekends go by WAY too fast :( 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy .. but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are . 
Long ago , and oh so far away ... I fell in love with you before the second show . Your guitar sounds so sweet and clear , but you're not really there ... it's just the radio . 
I will be 24 in exactly 6 months . It's not Valentines Day , it's my half birthday . ;) 
Cannot wait for tomorrow ! 
If I had a shotgun , you know what I'd do ? 
Boondock Saints never gets old . Willem Dafoe cracks me up every time . :)

Tune in , turn off , drop out , drop in , switch off , switch on , and explode .

Okay it seems like everyone is going to Bonaroo this year besides me and you know why ? Please forgive me but the lineup SUCKS ! It's all stupid indie rock , rap , and hip-hop ! There are like 6 bands I MIGHT want to see . Call me old school or whatever but Lil < PROPMALE > ?! WTF ?! The best band on the lineup is The Black Keys and I am not paying $300 bucks to see them .

felt like I was going to drown while taking Laney to school this morning . What a downpour ! I was soaked !

Oh , I am so glad it is wine o'clock . 
Woot ! Woot ! I got everything I was looking for today ! I know a certain lady who is going to be very happy tomorrow ! and did you know they make whole bed sheet sets that feel like your favorite old T-shirt ? For TWENTY bucks ! I can't wait to go to sleep tonight . lol 
mmmm . . . garlic tuscan noodles , breaded chicken , and white wine . I love myself lol 
It really does get worse before it gets better :/ 
I should have bought something stronger than wine at the liquor store . . . 
I'm gonna find me a hole in the wall , I'm gonna crawl inside and die . . . . Love that song ! 
I act like it doesn't bother me . I tell you I don't care ; that it's the past and I can't change the past . But I can't sleep . I can't eat , drink , or smoke enough . 
fuck 11:11 . It's 12:12 lol 
Everything is good again . Thank God .
