Heroism on command , senseless violence , and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -how passionately I hate them ! ~ Albert Einstein 

Cause’ if one day you wake up and find that your missing me and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be , Thinking maybe you’d come back here to the place that we’d meet Then you’d see me waiting for you on the corner of the stre

-Let's start a riot!/Don't put your life in someone's hands They're bound to steal it away Don't hide your mistakes ' Cause they'll find you , burn you If you want to get out alive Hold on for your life 
Haha , just when I though life couldn't get better , it does ... ! I missed my friends over the past weeks , I can't believe I haven't < PROPMALE > out with them in so long ! Thanks for the fun night ! 
i hate it when i upset people whose company i enjoy , sorrry ... 
See no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil 
Rephrasing , credit to < PROPFIRST > Rhodes ;D : See all evil , Hear all evil , refrain from speaking evil 
all that we have is hope and love so don't you worry ' bout a thing 
Self affirmations are for the weak minded and insecure , but I think I really need some right now to prevent me from doing a really really big mistake . I need some serious reverse psycology ! 
one mans sorrow is another mans happiness mwah-ha-ha ! ;) 
I LIVE !!!! 
Awesome early christmas party . Thanks < PROPFIRST > and friends ! =D 
AHHHH ! I'm about to die from extreme pain ! 
wow , i just finished watching new < PROPFEMALE > . i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing . Gosh , i don't know which is worse , the first where she always looks like she smells something bad and she's super clingy , or the second , where she's whiny , suicidal and has two guys going after her which she both blows off at the end ... 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > dinner in < PROPFEMALE > ... it'll be interesting to see how it turns out =D 
HAHA , < PROPFEMALE > Christmass everyone !!!!!!! Happy holidays !!! 
Don't be scared and have no fear I will show you what it means If there's no pain Rules are still the same I'm with you , just lead me I'm ready to play T.N.T. for the brain What you feel is insane It is love and not a game T.N.T. for the brain 
I love life ! And friends .... and roommates ..... and squad leaders .... and really chill people . =D Yep , those chill people are really cool . They're fun to be around . 
Don't let them get where they're going to , You know they're only what they think of you . You heard of this emotional tricky , And you feel like you were learning the ropes . 
Headache ... sleepy ... hungry ... grumpy ... whine , whine , whine , complain , complain , complain , I don't wanna play basketball today ... and we're gonna have TWO practices a DAY from now on ... more complaining , more whining , a little more whine and complain ... I gotta do something good for myself ... 
Back from Dehli !!! UNDEFEATED !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Won 4 games in a row , and first team to ever beat the Montfort team on the AES court !!! I call that a success ! ~ Can't wait for big bro Dhianjot Megalli to come ! ~ 
Dum doo doo ....... my mind feels really blank right now .... I think I talked out all my words today .......... doo dum dum 
10 more days ' till rishikiesh , 6 more school days ! let's see how many of those i can fake being sick ;) 
Wow , never knew I could miss this years 12th graders this much . The school feels so empty without them ! [[ throroughly exhausted ]] 
4 days till yoga festival , 2 weeks till spring break and 10 weeks till home !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait to see all mi friends in FL ! 
I see you coming ' round the bend I just can't think of anything that can make me smile like you can 
We belong to the music ! Don't kill the beat . << Rishikiesh in a day , fun in the Ganga ! I'm sure some of you know what i mean ;) >> 
seriously considering running away with a circus next year ... maybe i'll find one somewhere in europe . 
For some reason , I'm more Rishikiesh-sick rather than homesick .... =( << fun-filled weekend .... < PROPFEMALE > In Wonderland and Earth Hour ... wonder what else lies ahead >> 
Normal kids would probably be freaking out about their Calculus or Spanish 2 exams coming up . But me , on the other hand , I'm stressing about what yoga set and meditation would be good for a businessman with digestive and insomnia problems and how to make a simple yet effective chart to explain the chakras and their charactaristics . Isn't this world backwards sometimes ?? 
SATs are over , exams are almost done , shirts are almost finished , and the bags aren't nearly packed . Yep , it's the end of the year alright ! And a hectic one at that ! I'll be back in FL on the 10th of May , so < PROPFEMALE > Gianacakes , < PROPMALE > Winchell , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( wherever the hell you are ) call me up and we can find tiem to < PROPFEMALE > out this summer !!! 
Sleepppp .... need to sleeeeeeepppppppp . Gosh , I'm gonna miss everyone sooo much ! Yes , EVERYONE , that was no typo . 
In < PROPMALE > , overnight . Still have 14 hours till home . dead tired but glad to be in < PROPFEMALE > 
Home sweet home ! 
Pooped . The day I get back , I'm already running around , doing spontaneous things with my mom . So far , I've gone to her work , her work dinner , a theatre play , gone to a friends house , slept in all day , gotten acupuncture , gotten a massage , and other small fun stuff . =) Still no beach yet , but we'll go . Tomorrow I might go ballroom dancing ! 
< PROPMALE > 
Oopps 
Connor :\ 
We haven't really got a system of deciding who , Roc . It's , uh ... \ 
\ 
Rocco :\ 
Me ! * Me* ! I'm the guy ! I know everyone ! Their habits , who they < PROPFEMALE > out \ 
with , who they talk to ! I've got phone < PROPFIRST > , addresses ! I know who \ 
they're fucking ! I know where they live ! We could kill * everyone . *\ 
\ 
Murphy :\ 
So what do you think ? \ 
I'm strangely comfortable with it . 
living life , missing a few from mpa , glad to be free soon ! 
FILM CAMP !! CAN'T WAIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Need . To . Excerisce . Tumble . DO ANYTHING PHYSICAL ! 
Is a 1780 good on SATs ?? 
I really have to get drawing again . Or writing . My hiatus has been dramatically declining me talents . Soon they may completly disinegrate ! 
100% Russian by blood , 100% American by citizenship , but 100% human by heart . \ 
<< small doubts are starting to form about soulmates >> 
I'll always wake up so confused\ 
each time I have that dream of you\ 
but , if you dreamt of me too\ 
Does that mean we dreamt the same dream ? 
I just got the best early b-day present ever !!!!! MY OWN HIGH QUALITY VIDEO CAMERA !!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !!!! 
I've been sitting watching life pass from the sidelines\ 
Been waiting for a dream to seep in through my blinds\ 
I wondered what might happen if I left this all behind\ 
Would the wind be at my back ? 
Finally back down from the clouds ...... almost . =) \Where's my angel ? \"" 
it's the first thing you see as you open your eyes\ 
the last thing you say as your saying good bye\ 
and something inside you is crying and driving you on , \ 
cause if you hadn't found me , i would've found you 
OPERATION COOK TATER TOTS AND POTATO PEROGI : SUCCESSFUL ! mmmmm ...... I love eating my own homemade food , there's just so much love in it . =) 
OPERATION EAT TATOR TOTS AND POTATO PEROGI : UNABLE TO FINISH .... tooooo much .... buttterrrrr ..... tooo much ... oil ....... 
Can't talk tonight , but message me and I'll reply super soon !!!! 
I think OPERATION ATOR TOTS gave me food poisoning .............. -.- 
The longer the wait , the sweeter the gift [ Something that has calmed my undecisive paranioa for the meanwhile ] 
All the crazy shit I did tonight\ 
Those will be the best memories . \ 
I just wanna let it go for the night\ 
That would be the best therapy for me . \ 
It's gettin ' late but I don't mind . @ < PROPFEMALE > Allard Chaaaarlie !! ;) 
Somewhere over the rainbow ....... 
Whenever I walk on tiles , I see a chessboard and start stepping on the tiles the way a knight would . No joke . 
Now that a friend is no longer a friend ( on FB ) I can say mean things about them . Mwah-ha-ha ! JK . I would never do that . Seriously . 
SHEIKRA 6 TIMES with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > 
I begin the tale\ 
With a breath , I inhale\ 
And cast a spell\ 
Using words that propel\ 
Set you assail\ 
To the place \ 
Where dreams of men dwell\ 
Nightmares efficiently await \ 
To test one's fate\ 
By how well\ 
You can deal with \ 
A tale that tells itself\ 
Said the storyteller\ 
A bestseller \ 
Is what I had in mind\ 
Ladies and gentlemen\ 
Settled in ? \ 
ONCE UPON A TIME\ 
IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND ME\ 
LA NOUBA 
Woot woot ! All people born in July are definatly born to have a great < PROPFEMALE > , maybe like RULE THE WORLD ! < PROPFIRST > Farmer , < PROPMALE > Brudno , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Drausinus McCoige , Gobind Singh , Dev Khalsa , < PROPFIRST > Schmidt and of course me . Happy birthday to all ! PS-sorry if i missed anyone who is qualified to be on the list of awesome 
I know a boy , who is very unique . He has an old soul , and a strong guiding spirit , but doesn't listen to what his heart tells him . He is talented in many things , but chooses not to use them . He has a graceful character and a rare charm , but to reveal himself is too hard for him . I do hope that young man will flourish into who he really is . We need people like him in this world 
Row ! There's only seven more < PROPMALE > to go\ 
We'll sail across dry lands\ 
We'll cut the grass in all\ 
We'll steal the single jewel\ 
We'll wipe the crystals dry 
Full Sail or FSU ???? Tough choice ! 
First day of film camp over and done with . Now I just have to get with the right group to realize my 5 minutes plan for a movie . PS- Any ideas anyone , for a 5 minutes movie that is set in Tampa Theatre ? 
I have a feeling I know mr shanghai knight and yet he chooses not to add me . How odd . It must be that he doesn't want to see all my blabbering statuses on his home < PROPFEMALE > . Tell me if I'm right shanghai knight . PS have you seen the movie shanghai knights with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Unoffically directing and writing the plot and screenplay of a short movie ! Can't wait until the end result ! 
In exactly a month I will be on a flight going to < PROPFEMALE > for the next 9 months . It gives me a funny feeling in my stomach , something that could make me throw up ... 
Great birthday today , chilling with good friends , taking it easy ! Thanks everyone for your birthday wishes and making today better ! Wish you all the best ! 
high off of one pill of benydrill !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hehehehe =D 
I think I have a small problem , my past has come back to haunt me from 5 years ago , and now I feel like the meanest andthe most gullible girl on earth . That's only slightly contridicting ... 
NCIS ........... marathon time ! 
Willingness doesnt ' sound right . Anyone have a synonym or a word that can be applied in the sence of ' if you're willing to' ? 
There was a boy\ 
A very strange enchanted boy\ 
They say he wandered very far , very far\ 
Over land and sea\ 
A little shy\ 
And sad of eye\ 
But very wise\ 
Was he\ 
And then one day\ 
A magic day he passed my way\ 
And while we spoke of many things , fools and kings\ 
This he said to me\ 
\The greatest thing\ 
Why then , O brawling love , O loving hate , O anything , of nothing first create ! O heavy lightness , serious vanity\ 
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms , \ 
Feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health , \ 
Still-waking sleep , that is not what it is ! \ 
This love feel I , that feel no love in this 
It makes me feel fuzzy inside when you're the first one to tell me [ Good Morning ] 
Less than three weeks to go ! Super busy , but if anyone wants to chill before I leave the country call me up . 7274598196 . I'll make special time ofr special people . =) \ 
( Voyage , voyage ) 
It's confusing when younger people seem older , and older people act younger . It throws everything off balance and I don't appreciate it .......... -.- 
I never thought he was blue , until now ... 
Mwah-ha-ha , I have my mom credit card and we're heading down to Miami ! Perfect scenario . 
Who really needs the past with the allure of something new ? 
Let's burn this filthy town straight into the ground with our dirty looks and glances\ 
Come on , can you hear us now , as we rock you , shock you , drop you , and make you want it more ? 
I love mowing mazes through tall grass . =D 
It's amazing how life works ! I love unexpected surprise !! Escpecially when a friend you haven't seen or heard from in 6 years comes back to town when you're in the same place ! =D I can't possibly express how happy I am . Although I'm a bit nervous about how much he's changed ..... 
Blood & Chocolate , True Blood & Moonlight . The Mentalist , Numb3rs , & Burn Notice . Sin City , X-men , & Elektra . How ' bout it , huh ? 
Woe , I shall leave this tranquil world of abundance for the hectic land of the gods . 
Yes , life does give you unexpected surprise , and then let's you down . Not very nice of you life ... or rather peoples poor choices of not going to * cough*vacation*cough * 
Ready for partying , < PROPFEMALE > Allard ?!?!?! =D 
Had the best time skating with < PROPMALE > Brudno and < PROPFEMALE > Brudno !! Thanks guys , it was really chil ( ha , chill ) and it felt like I wasn't leaving for 9 months . I'm gonna miss you and keep in touch . ( E-mail/skype is better , facebook sucks in < PROPFEMALE > ) 
In < PROPFEMALE > , settling in with my roomies . =) Terribly missing FL and peeps , but I think I can pull through 9 more months . I'm thinking of starting a blog for this year .... opinions ?? 
Fasten your seat belt < PROPFEMALE > , ' cause Kansas is going bye-bye . 
Love sings , \ 
When it transcends the bad things . \ 
Have a heart and try me , \ 
' cause without love I won't survive . 
Really wishes she wasn't physically limited the way she is .... Special thanks to my neurotic and reactive nature . Never showing that side of me again 
Movies are up on Youtube ! Check them out and give me feedback pleeeeeeeease !!!!!!!!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28b-kUoU42w\ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyk0xmdk2rk 
Surprisingly very happy and content . I certainly hope it lasts , but I'm sure it will with meditation and good friends =) Yes , this year will be vey good , I have a feeling . 
People like us use their bodies like exploding weapons wired\ 
Never excusing while we're standing as we dance tonight away , oh yeah 
Chillin with my roomies , lights low , candle burning and listening to calm music . Yes , life is good . If only , though ,..... 
Kings Of < PROPFIRST > are performing at the Florida Fairgrounds on the 18th ! I strongly dislike being away for such events !!!!! Darn it , why can't bands tour < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I see you comin round the [ corner]\ 
I just can't think of anything that can\ 
make me smile like you can 
Life is a wheel of changes\ 
But changes are life\ 
And someday we will have to say good bye\ 
But our spirit will survive \ 
Reason is lasting , passion is living\ 
And dying is teaching us how to live 
The principles of lust are easy to understand , \ 
do what you feel , feel until the end . \ 
The principles of lust are burned in your mind\ 
do what you want , do it until you find love ... \ 
<< Time together isn't ever quite enough \ 
When you and I are alone , I’ve never felt so at home >> 
Brown eyes i hold you near cuz youre the only song i long to hear , a < PROPFEMALE > softly soaring through my atmosphere where soul meets body 
I want to live where soul meets body\ 
And let the sun wrap its arms around me\ 
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing\ 
And feel , feel what its like to be new 
Sleepy , sleepy . In the middle of the day going to sleep ! That's a new record for me ! I must be super exhausted . \ 
Going away from facebook for a while , seems like a very insincere way of communicating . 
Tonight we dance \ 
I leave my life in your hands \ 
We take the floor \ 
Nothing is forbidden anymore \ 
Don't let the world in outside \ 
Don't let a moment go by \ 
Nothing can stop us tonight 
Everyday the world goes faster , \ 
turning faster than it seems , \ 
Let's not talk about tomorrow\ 
Leave me here on the street of dreams 
I was reborn today . 
I was reborn yesterday and became a ghost today . 
Soooo tired , but don't wanna sleep because I hate missing i single moment of the day . -.- 
A pretty piece of flesh I am .... \ 
<< \Do you bite your thumb at us 
Akinbola was right when he dubbed < PROPFIRST > Guetta is a musical genius ! \ 
Four to the floor , I was sure , never seeing clear , \ 
I could have it all , whenever you are near . 
They call me The Wild < PROPFEMALE > \ 
But my name was < PROPFEMALE > Day \ 
Why they call me it I do not know \ 
For my name was < PROPFEMALE > Day 
Our love is alive , and so we begin\ 
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table\ 
Stumblin ' in\ 
Our love is a flame , burning within\ 
Now and then firelight will catch us\ 
Stumblin ' in 
Delicatly underneath the surface of calm water in a nice warm bath . I don't want to move a muscle . Tomorrow , though , I will have to come up and take a deep breath and face the cold air . Good night all , friends and family from Florida and all over the world , I love you all . 
Happy diwali !! 5 day weekend ! Feels like hurricane weekend back home , without the wind and rain . 
Great dinner , thanks guys ! 
In Malaysia ! It's amazing !! Tropical and warm weather during the winter , the smell of a home cooked meal in a nice and cozy house , just chillin and relaxing . Now this is the life . 
Almost had an FML moment in the airport . =\\ cant wait to see the ocean , thailand in a few hours ! 
In the land of the sunshine\
