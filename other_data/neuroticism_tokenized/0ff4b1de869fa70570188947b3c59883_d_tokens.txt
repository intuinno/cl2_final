Earlier this week , the Supreme Court ruled that businesses and corporations are protected under free speech rights , and are allowed to have a legal say in political matters ( including elections ) .

Question : How does changing your profile pic to a character from television in your childhood help fight child abuse ?

Contrary to popular belief , the Paladin in many RPGs is not a stupid , over-zealous , and judgmental class . It can be played that way ; I play the class paladin , however , and I refuse to believe that any source of a paladin's power ( be it a god , an ideal , or the light itself ) would want its champions to be poor representatives of their causes . Thank you for your time . 
Never underestimate the power of stupid people .
