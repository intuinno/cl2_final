There is no such thing as tornados . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > just hates trailer parks . 
Just got in from Tucson . Nothing like a nice 17 hours in a car to finish out your vacation ... tomorrow will be THE WORST !, At least we made it home safe and had a great time all week . 
I kind of miss the warm glow of CRT monitors ... 
I got 99 problems and they all bitches 
People said \Van Gogh you can't be a great artist because you only have one ear ! \ " He then said \ " I can't hear you \"" 
Wipe that stupid look off your face and go to bed . 
I have this burning urge in me that wants to decimate a whole chocolate cake ... 
Living off of Ibuprofen ... wtb new knees 
oh yeah and one more thing .... FOR THE HORDE ! 
Worst day of my life . 
Some days you just need a peanut < PROPMALE > parfait to survive ...

Thanks to everyone who has wished me happy birthday so far ! From this point on anyone else who wishes me a happy birthday will be noted as a slacker . Thanks again ! 
I really hate it when I hear someone say “It will Automatically do it” DIAF
