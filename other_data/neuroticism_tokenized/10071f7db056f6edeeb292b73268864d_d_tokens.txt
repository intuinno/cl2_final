I had no choice in typing this statement that you are now reading . All events are predetermined by previous events leading all the way back to the big bang .

Flood , Stream , Channel , and Port . An interesting set of words , they tie together in the context of water as well as technology . Fishing/Phishing and Worm can also loosely fit in there .
