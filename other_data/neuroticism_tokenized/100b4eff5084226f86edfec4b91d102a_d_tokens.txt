being laid off sucks 

can't wait for snow fall and bolton valley to open up so i can ski and ride the slopes again woohoo 
I think im not far from loosing a person very close to my heart right now and I'm hoping i can change that because its my fault that its happening so I'm now determined to not lose her cause I love her dearly and I want her in my life . I'm stuck trying to figure out what will work best to help me to my goal . any suggestions will be taken curtiously . 
feeling better now maybe not as much of a jerk in her eyes cant wait to see her again xoxo love you forever

got home today rebuilt a bike but still needs more fixing and tore out old motorcycle wiring harness and trying to put in the new one which is turning out to be a real drag . going to the sunday party at lift should be a blast . 
ok so out of my high school friends who is in montpelier that would like to come out dancing at lift tomarrow night ? or anyone else you have to be 18 plus though sorry 
just finished a 15 mile plus moutain bike ride had a blast and just my luck had to walk my bike from mont bike path too house after blowing a tube but thats an easy fix . I wanna take a nice dip in the water somewhere but i dont know if i want to just hop right into the < PROPFEMALE > or river unless someone were to join me cause it is really fast now , went kayaking yesterday down it .

The final dance performance went awesome . tomarrow heading up to costco to get supplies for the hot dog cart but tonite i have the house to myself and can do what i want mom and < PROPFIRST > are on a date so im free yea 
2nd day running the hot dog cart with my dad im hoping to be running it alone until < PROPMALE > get out of school but we shall see . one thing i know is that its not as easy as it seems and requires a lot more knowledge memory and learning than i had though but its good for me i think . 
running the hot dog cart again today but I do believe I will be on my own for a while today should be interesting . then coming home and with some help will be finishing the tinting of my car . 
going to the club tonite wish i had some one that would want to come out tonite 
wtf everything cant go right for me this week ive tried doing all kinds of stuff and people have started trying thing with me and in the end they never work out I don't get it . its like a curse what will not work out next or what will go wrong I dont know but it needs to change cause I want to have things go as planned or atleast when you make a plan have the people stick to it . 
ran the hot dog cart today then went for a nice kayak ride . met my dad back at shore and then got to go tubing on the speed boat for the first time this year . had a blast and a great day . its about time things go my way

anyone wanna come out dancing tonite ill even pay their admission its my last night out on the town for quite a while atleast 2 years 
i figured it out before when i was asking if people would want to come out dancing with me i thought it was because i was uncool in high school so they didnt want to go with me but its not that at all its that anyone i ask hasnt gone yet and is scared to go cause its so different from what they are used to 
woo hoo just got back from running our hot dog cart downtown and now im relaxing finally
