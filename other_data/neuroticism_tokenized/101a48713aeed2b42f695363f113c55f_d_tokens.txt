saw district 9 with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > . it was way awesome . i could almost feel the gore spray , and yet there were moments i even teared up a little . go see it .

They really should move Thanksgiving to early August or late September . 
Twenty-six feels so old today . 
this is what i get for never getting on the computer : everybody gave me \happy birthday\ " s and i didn't know until today ! but it was like getting a little bonus birthday a week later . thanks everybody . :) "

car trouble = lame 
stranded in the middle of nowhere where the only people who know where i am are the friends i came out here to visit who don't have a car . no way back to < PROPMALE > , no way to get to my 7:30 am class , and no matter what the towing and repair < PROPMALE > , i can't afford it = an angry and whiney zandy . 
it's lonely in illinois . 
gaping hole where my headlight used to be , new fringe around the rim of my tire , furry smear along the whole length of my car ... damn deer . 
yay for having a car again 
finally watched dr. horrible's sing-along blog last night . yay for everything . 
trying to watch queer as folk . got disc two and it was majorly damaged , completely split from center to outside . so we sent it back and have been waiting for a new disc . comes in the mail today , and i'm all excited . then i open the envelope and pull out the sleeve and the disc falls out in three pieces . is my mailman screwing with me ? is somebody renting these discs just to break them and send them back ? wtf mate ? 
threatened by rednecks at the island of misfit toys .

re-watching six feet under . again . 
my hands are coated in silver , but i'm done printing . 
the worst is over . and i finally got to sleep . 
Take my love , take my land Take me where I cannot stand I don't care , I'm still free You can't take the sky from me Take me out to the black Tell them I ain't comin ' back Burn the land and boil the sea You can't take the sky from me There's no place I can be Since I found Serenity But you can't take the sky from me ... 
\pretty spry for a corpse \""

i'm at my mom's and it's cold .

a seven nation army couldn't hold me back

i survived summer printmaking 2010

supermassive black hole

there's only us there's only this forget regret or life is yours to miss no other road no other way no day but today 
zombie mashed potatoes 
hopping on the \livejournal backwards revolution \"" 
started ceramics today . will be cover in mud for a month starting monday . 
nostalgia should be classified as a controlled substance . chasing the dragon of memory . 
i had zombie dreams . ( they were fast zombies ) 
finally got to swim . 
i finally saw gone with the wind . i think i might throw up now . ( those thoughts are not related . ) 
i need more < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > in my life . 
I've looked at love from both sides now , \ 
From give and take , and still somehow\ 
It's love's illusions i recall . \ 
I really don't know love at all 
yay for swimming with the zombies . 
randome life quote : \ 
\but pumpkin's peein\ " \ 
i dreamed i had a pimp hat 
i threw a pot today . 
i hate sundays . 
i love my mom . 
i have never seen anyone wear a < PROPFEMALE > pack on their < PROPFEMALE > . 
i am so not one of the cool kids . 
i want to watch fear and loathing in las vegas again . 
on my way to zombieland 
i miss my dad . 
firefly = <3 
just keep swimming . 
shakedown 1979 , cool kids never have the time on a live wire right up off the street you and i should meet junebug skipping like a stone with the headlights pointed at the < PROPFEMALE > we were sure we'd never see an end to it all and i don't even care to shake these zipper blues and we don't know just where our bones will rest to dust i guess forgotten and absorbed into the earth below 
nargles 
i survived ceramics ! yay , now i finally get to start my summer vacation . 
yay for the new < PROPFEMALE > and eclipse soundtracks , which now belong to me . i'm excited about sia on the new soundtrack , but disappointed that there's no muse . 
everything hurts . 
so < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is still kinda useless as < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > lautner is still the hottest thing to ever sprout cg fur and fangs . 
yay for fireworks ! 
fire bad , tree pretty 
p h.d. in horribleness 
i think i passed the knight bus on my way back to < PROPMALE > . 
yay for cheap faux-lasagna made with scrappy at-hand ingredients . i'm surprised , it's actually pretty tasty . 
i have finally finished reading the dark tower . 
skipping sleep on days that i have a low responsibility quotient does a lot to increase my joy for the day . 
i had my doubts when i first saw previews , but < PROPFIRST > pilgrim vs . the world was pretty awesome . chock full of geektastic fun . 
all my life i have thought there was something wrong with me because i frequently feel so awkward in social situations . today i think maybe the problem is the way other people act around me , after < PROPFEMALE > told me about people giving me dirty looks in professional practices and after the guy who wouldn't just go around my car when i stopped to check the mail . 
i am not looking forward to the new doctor . i'm sure he's alright , but i really enjoy < PROPFIRST > eccleston ( and for the not-so-geeks in the house , i'm talking television not medical ) . 
* thinks idly about starting a hardin county flickr group * 
doesn't anybody stay up late and do weird random fun stuff anymore ? why am i so old on the outside and old on the inside and so 19 in the space between ? 
1 . turn on your mp3 player\ 
2 . set to shuffle\ 
3 . the third song is your zombie apocalypse battle anthem\ 
4 . post it here 
saw the expendables . it was a movie . there were explosions . then i re-watched district 9 which is still freaking awesome . then i watched taintlight , a twilight parody with a budget of two which was so bad it was hilarious . 
bad things : life is expensive . good things : i found a 1TB portable hard drive that is compatible with both the macs at school and my pc . also i've discovered that my nail polish glows in the dark , and i call that a win . 
damn you , last.fm angry bear . 
i survived my first public speaking presentation . i talked too fast , my voice shook like hell and i couldn't let go of the podium , but they laughed ( at the jokes not at me ) and it's over . and now : is there anyone out there who'd be up for zombie-hood in a couple of mondays ? 
i wish i had big scary lawyer and/or cop friends . 
i have thoroughly enjoyed having an extra day of fall break , but i still think fall break should be a week like spring break . i like fall better . 
wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff 
bowties are cool . 
lithography is a process created by satan to piss me off .

finally done printing for the night . and < PROPFEMALE > was right about the ink cartridges , they really go further than you'd think . 
my bfa review went pretty well . i'm feeling good . 
i just got my first trick-or-treaters ever . and they were in their twenties . and i don't mind a bit . age limits on trick-or-treating are stupid . 
staying up all night scanning negatives and watching < PROPMALE > . makes me think i should go into forensics . and get better locks . 
life is good today because my paper is finished and it's the weekend . 
i'm so ready for this semester to be over . except for the part where next semester's going to be ten times worse . 
< PROPMALE > hoskins , < PROPFIRST > leguizamo , < PROPFIRST > hopper , and < PROPFEMALE > mathis = super < PROPFIRST > bros . <3 
was up all night in the photo lab/gaydiscotechnohiphopdanceclub and tonight was the painting open house which was all kinds of fun . one more day of classes , whoo ! 
semester = finished . 
so , even though i have about a hundred books on my kindle and a few in my apartment that i haven't read , i am now re-reading the ultimate hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy . i blame casteele for letting me watch the movie . 
it feels like a transformers kind of day . 
i wish i had pears . ( incidentally , due to typographical error , that sentence started out as : \i wish i had bears . \ " which would be an entirely different flavor sensation . ) " 
i'm at my mom's . i'm staying up way too late ' cause i'm me . i'm flipping through the satellite channel guide ( i don't have cable at home so tv's become a bit of a novelty again ) and i'm almost blind . so as i pass the shopping channel i read \Zumba Fitness\ " as \ " Zombie Fitness . \ " sometimes not being able to see makes the world way more interesting . " 
my mother's alarm clock has been going off for an entire episode of angel . she hasn't even hit snooze . i wish i could say i took after my dad on this one . 
raisin & spice is my new favorite instant oatmeal flavor . 
i had forgotten what a great voice < PROPFIRST > hetfield has . 
i'm really sad thatThe Birdcage is not available on netflix instant viewing . 
yay for < PROPMALE > show and sushi night 
let go and let paint . 
awesome days st < PROPMALE > with crashing life drawing and end with beer-drinking < PROPMALE > kids .
