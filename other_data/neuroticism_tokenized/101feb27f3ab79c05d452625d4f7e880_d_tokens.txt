Oh glorious gods ! Tonight two titans , once gods , clashed once again under the rampant sounds of Zeus ' mighty cries from the heavens . Deceived by the tricks of the other , one god suffered a most humiliating defeat . Alas his virtue doth not allow him to hold a grudge , so for now they rest in hope that this be the last score in need of settling . 
She's just too beautiful :) Got to see her today and it made not only my day but my week 2
