Copy this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face , except for a punch in the face ! But we can raise awareness . 93% of people won't repost this : That's because they need a punch in the face .
