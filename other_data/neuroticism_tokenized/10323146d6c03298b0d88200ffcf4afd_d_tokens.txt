Perfect by nature\ 
Icons of self indulgence \

If ignorance is bliss , how come there aren't more happy people ? 
Tired ... * yawn *

Haunting these walls\ 
Shadows crawling out , revealing\

I thought if I could touch this place , oh feel it , this broken place inside me might start healing . Out here it's like I'm someone else , I thought maybe I could find myself . 
Ever after never came and I'm still waiting for a love I'll never have . All the dreams I've laid to rest are ghosts that keep me . After all that I've become , I am only one 
Okay , I'm going to forgive you because I'm a very Zen person ... and I'm on a lot of pain medication right now . \
