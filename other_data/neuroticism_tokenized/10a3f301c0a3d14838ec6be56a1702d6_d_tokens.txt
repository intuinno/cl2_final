Has to go do way too much homework for the 3rd day of school .

Whats better : Doing the right thing because you want to , or doing the right thing because you want to get into some super exclusive club for only people who believe the exact same thing as you ? Also , wth would i want to go to a place where everyone believes the same thing ? i would rather be in hell with a bunch of people who have their own opinions . 
Saw the play and liked it . Thinks < PROPFIRST > did a good job directing ( still dont know exactly what that means ) . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Poe did something in his writing : he chose his letters , for instance , to make the effect of a heartbeat ( scary , or w/e ) , he would add a lot of the letter d , or to make it longer to say a sentence , he would use a lot of the letter g , apparently a lot of the letter s gives the effect : evil . Does anyone know what this effect is called , or more letters that give similar effects ? 
just spent half my life savings on a keyboard . 
i think its funny the way videogames have adopted the drug catchphrase : \first one's free . \ " (\" first month free . \")" 
Is trying to teach himself Jazz .
