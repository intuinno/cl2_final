Today we celebrate the One Who was born < PROPMALE > , when God came near in the flesh , and love came looking for the last , the lowest , the least , and the lost . Thank You , Father , for Jesus Christ the Lord !!!!

I remember my dad saying once that he took time to slow down so he could hear himself think . Today has been a good day for following that Godly counsel . 
One of the deeper questions in life ... Doing homework and doing laundry : do they go together or am I in the right place at the wrong time ???

On this day , I am thankful for the father that got me here , and thankful for the Father that keeps me while I am yet here . I am truly grateful for such blessings ! 
just left Nashville Shores . Lots of fun , but where did all these kids come from ? 
May my heart be broken by the things that break the heart of God .... My heart is restless unless it finds rest in Him . I am grateful for this everlasting , relentless preoccupation with God , trying to apprehend that for which I was apprehended . 
Goodnight one and all . 
Just got back from my high school reunion a little while ago . What an AWESOME time it was !!!!!! I am so thankful to have had such an opportunity .

I am grateful I was allowed the privilege to serve . I am grateful also for those who still do , and for those who have given their last full measure of devotion . God bless every one ! 
Thank you , one and all ! 
It is said that a man who has 3 good friends is < PROPMALE > . I see that I have so many more . God has indeed blessed me with each of you in my life . I love you all , and pray God's best for each of you . 
To one and all : may the God of Peace , even our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , be with you this season . May His blessings be yours in full , and may the Lord Himself be your provision for the coming year . I love you all , and am so grateful for the influence you have on my life . 
At home with the wifey . Both sick with flu-like yuck . Thanks for sharing , bbcakes ! 
Still yucky , still sick .. but still loved by God and still saved ! 
Feeling much better !!!! Thank You , Lord !
