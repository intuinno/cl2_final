That was a long night , a cool night , a sleepless night ; but to say these things without celebrating the achievements that arose on that occasion then henceforth would be an iniquity not even time would forgive millennia thereon . So I say to those , whom took to the stage and put on an act to rock the ages , never forget the experience . 
Jalalabad is in Afghanistan , the Confederated States of Micronesia has a booming spice trade , and the Castilians have a natural lisp 
Diese Scheiße ist Bananen . Genug sagten

I'm glad I'm not Brezhnev . Being the Russian leader in the Kremlin . You never know if someone's tape recording what you say . -Nixon 
Unless a president can protect the privacy of the advice he gets , he cannot get the advice he needs . -Nixon 
It's a piece of cake until you get to the top . You find you can't stop playing the game the way you've always played it . -Nixon
