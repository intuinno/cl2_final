I saw some dude get tackled by the cops on Sir < PROPMALE > . Hilarious ? I think so ! 
When my mother was pregnant with me , they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins . They did another ultrasound a few weeks later , where they discovered that I had resorbed the other fetus . Do I regret this ? No , I believe his tissues made me stronger . I , now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby . 
Taking a huge leap I've never taken before . BX 
I need to control myself , man . 
The core of mans ' spirit comes from new experiences . 
Don't ever fucking question that . 
:'[ 
I had to throw some spontaneity into the mix so , off to the cemetary with Bundy . I hope it's good therapy . 
Had the best day . I feel better . :] 
I want to run away to the backcountry of Japan . I'd built a cozy cottage and snowboard with a playlist of really intense orchestratic scores blaring in my ears . That's where I want to be . 
Not worried , got that good good . haha 
Had the best sleep I've had in awhile . I'm feelin ' awesome & I'm pleased with almost every aspect of my life , finally . shawwwiiiinnng

Are you coming ? 
Well , I'm back . 
I just want to jam . That's all . 
Cryyyyyyyyyyyyyyin ' over you !! 
I just don't know what to do ... 
This new facebook is a crock . 
Bowling then Brandt's . woo 
Too much frosting has been consumed . Almost done . What to do after this ? 
I'm misplacing way too many things lately . 
Squeeze me baby , til the juice runs down my leg . The way you squeeze my lemon , I'm gonna fall right out of bed . 
I'm nervous about tonight . You'll never hear me say that again about anything . 
I am Recyclops . 
1 . ) I wish someone would purchase me Circa Survive tickets for my birthday . I'd be at your service for life . 2 . ) Being here really boosts my self-esteem . ;D 3 . ) Grand Slam @ < PROPFIRST>'s! 
Pickles & Oriental Ramen . Good call . 
Hookah bar tonight with the boys & also with the hopes of something fantastically perfect happening to me on March 16th . 
Congratulations , you've successfully made me feel like scum . :[ 
Honestly , I feel like havin ' a few drinks & dancing ' til my legs fall off . 
Playing Pokemon Red Version to kill the time . Sweeeeet . 
So , I totally have the best friends ever . Thank you for all the birthday wishes , they really made my day . ( Bundy , you're the best , b t w !!!! Thanks for the awesomely perfect gifts . ) Now , I'm off to have a delicious meeting with some delicious looking people . <3 
From the south . I got them diamonds in my mouth . 
Bout to get my party on in San < PROPMALE > . ;] 
Another day , another opportunity . 
I am the nicest , sweetest person you'll ever meet , but I'll be damned if I let anyone walk all over me . Don't expect me not to back myself up , haters . 
What to do ? What to do ? Hmmm . . . . . 
You got beef but there's worms in your Wellington . I'll put a hole in your skull and extract your gelatin . 
I've died and gone to heaven . Here in the Loftin at SAC , there appears to be a band consisting of horns , an upright bass and a banjo that's about to perform some sweet , sweet music @ 11:00 . 
I need a whole lotta new . I'm excited . 
Rave last night was awesome . My legs are so sore . Can't Stop Won't Stop ! 
I wonder why I try to find a way out no matter what . It's unfortunate for the parties involved . 
I need an acoustic guitar soon . My creative juices are clogged ! D: 
& also , I really want to start an acoustic jam band type deal that does sickass covers , among other things . But , I want to include hip-hop , funk , and a lot of other genres . Sounds tasty . 
Shutter Island @ 8:05 with my boys . ;D 
I'd do anything for some Miso soup right now . :[ 
Off to see the Spurs tonight . OklaHOMO is going down . ;D I decided to take your OK nickname , Brandt . < PROPFEMALE > me . 
This always happens to me . * palm on forehead SLAP * 
Plans got cancelled . Who has something to preoccupy me with tonight ? ;D 
We can dance if we want to . We can leave your friends behind ' cause your friends don't dance & if they don't dance then , they're no friends of mine . 
I wish I had a car , a moped , a motorcycle , anything ! :[ 
Last night I immediately found out a few things . 1 . ) Whiskey is the enemy , even though it's delicious . 2 . ) Never drink it straight from the bottle . 3 . ) Don't go to a party w/ only one bathroom . 4 . ) < PROPFIRST > in the Box is not appealing when you're plastered &/or sick . So , I got 3hrs of sleep & I haven't the slightest idea why I'm up this early . I guess the point of this post is .. Does anyone want to go get some breakfast ? 
Going after what I want & not stopping until I get it . 
Question : Is anyone else planning on going to Marley Fest on April 17th in < PROPFIRST > ?? I plan on going , but I also would like to stay either the entire weekend or at least that Saturday night . So , is anyone game ? 
Game plan : Build a cabin in the woods somewhere where there is an even ratio of snow & sunlight . Purchase an R.V. , a guitar , a keyboard , Traktor Pro , a ton of terriyaki beef jerky/miso soup , & travel constantly . Sounds rad . 
Nothing makes me feel classier than listening to < PROPFIRST > Mingus in the morning . ;] 
All I have to say about tonight is , \Wow . \"" 
Going home to do some cleaning & well-deserved primping , then I'm headed to < PROPFIRST > for the night !! ;D 
If anyone else is gonna be in < PROPFIRST > tonight and wants to meet up & roam the town a later tonight , call me ! 550 5009 ;] 
< PROPFIRST > was a blast . Kerby's was delicious , 2 person improv tale-telling is hilarious , & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is my new best friend . 
I fell asleep in the shower for an obscene amount of time earlier . I also had a dream in that very shower that I was Dancing with < PROPFIRST > Walken to The < PROPFIRST > Brown theme song . Why it wasn't Weapon of Choice ? I wouldn't know . 
One time I was invited to come to a social gathering . I was paid a handsome amount of money . I brought a shotgun and a bottle of Tanqueray and showed those people the best fuckin ' time they've ever seen . 
Lack of sleep has finally caught up with me . I'm going to take a nap and dream about Tuesday . <3 
If there's one thing I hate , it's losing . If there's two things I hate , it's losing & getting cancer ....... I better do something BADASS tonight . 
The only thing that's keeping me in town & alive is the fact that I'm seeing Circa Survive on Tuesday . After that , I'm considering leaving . 
Sometimes I don't even know why I waste valueable time & energy on this . 
My mind's not a well . It won't run dry . Just keep drinkin water and you'll be alright . 
I need a good guy who can get me out of this town . :O 
My luck lies in the messages hidden everywhere . 
moody . 
How low can you go ? How low can you go ?

I wish that I could aimlessly do something right now . Maybe drive around , or something completely on impulse . :/ At least I have fuel for writing , but still .. It just doesn't suffice sometimes . 
What's an adventurer to do ? 
Can't believe that actually exists . :O Pulled an all-nighter . Now , I'm going to get ready to have some breakfast with the long , lost < PROPFIRST > , then time to get my scholastic on . Good morning , Tuesday . I hope you're better than yesterday . <3

Tonight , there will be no standing up straight . It'll either be leanin ' towards any direction or slouchin ' to the front . 
^ & counter . 
Monday = Bubble tea <3 , blood rocks , off balanced mind & body , the 70's , a burger that's taken me 30min & counting to finish + fries that haven't been touched , smooth ass tunes , mystery , inner itches , & lots of curiousity . What's new with you ? ' cause I'll tell ya , I can feel so much changing . 
Worst sleep ever ? Possibly . It's gonna be one of those days , man . 
Not gonna lie , this is all pretty outrageous . 
I wanna rock with you all night . 
Okay , enough pictures . Does anyone want to go do something tonight ?? Movie , coffee , exploration , set land mines , anything ? 
I'm diggin ' this whole thing . 
Kinda considering Bonnaroo this year . The lineup is pretty badass . 
Damnit .

I can not wait for Spring Love !!! 
Say , I need you to want me , to hold me , to tell me the truth . 
I give it until June 1st to land this shit . 
Life , you're the shit . 
I can feel it coming in the air tonight . Oh , lord .

Bad day turned hilarious & awesome . Gettin ' super stoked/prepared for Spring Love with < PROPFEMALE > :D , new game plan + I need a sketchbook . Ahh , I'm stoked on life .

Landed a job at Shisha !! Super stoked , son . Goin ' bowling tonight & Spring Love is in 3 days !!! :D Life is tasty . 
Finally , Spring Love tonight !!! I can't wait to dance , swim , friggin ' explore the hotel , & dance some more ! :D Best week I've had in months . I'm pumped . 
Off to work . If anyone wants to go out for some late night breakfast when I get off around 3:00 , hit me up ! ;D 
Grumbly in my tumbly for some stir frumbly , yumbly . 
Off to work to make that cashflow , smoke hookah , learn Arab , & drink Mondo Monster ! Come visit & leave a delicious tip . Furthermore , today was real strange , but I dig it ;] . Oh , & don't drink a Tiki Torch if you're eating Mongolian stumbly frumbly . It's a weird combo . Schlataaaa . 
Had my first nightmare ever last night . At least , the only one I can recall . :[ Anywho , I have the day off so I'm ready to take advantage of it . What are YOU doing ? 
What do I do now ?? Hmmm ... 
I hate when my bed feels too big for me , D: . It's okay , bed . I still love you & all that you offer . Even the trickery , ' cause you feel nice . 
Goin ' to the river with my boogie shoes . Whatchu gon ' do ?

Great day , well , for the most part . I'ma end it with Hellraiser , a delicious sesh , & a sleepover with my old , and very missed friends . ;D 
I wanna be an airborne ranger . I wanna lead a life of danger . Before the day I die , there's five things I wanna ride : Bicycle , tricycle , automobile , virgin's mother , & a ferris wheel . ----- Meh . 
Meh , iffymess , this is . 
That's why my friends call me Whiskers . 
I have nothing to say , guys . Time to work . 
I had an amazing night . Rode the electric wheelchair all over walmart , got The Office on dvd , some yarn for awesome beanies & such , i d k . Everything's just super lately , bahahahahahahahahahahahaha . 
Things I hate : Being dead tired , then getting home only to be wide awake . I guess that means AM cleaning . Oh , well . ;{ P 
I'ma be M.I.A. until between 6:00 - 10:00 tonight at worst . Thanks , insomnia . 
I like distorted things , I like high contrast a lot . Good lord , I need to fix my A.C. , it's too hot to clean . I want to fight someone , I feel the aggression building up . Am I getting sick or is it just the smoke ? Zen Den in the works , it'll be delish . I think my Sprite is hot now . I'd like my mochi . I missed you , Phox . Why don't you just move in with < PROPMALE > McBride & co . & myself ? Diggin ' the electronic movement .

Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahaalol . 
Beorne tomorrow ? How exciting ! I love chocolate milk . I can't sleep :'[ . Laces on the men-je'! ahaha , I want to write a funny book right now . 
crazy dream about ghost biggie , having zebra striped hair , rape , bagel bites , a house party , rap hell- taken there by Biggie through the floors , & metal hell- taken there through a tv by some random rock stars through a static-y tv so that they could beat Satan with gorgeous harmonics ..... weird . 
Your mind makes me happy . I'ma start my day now and get the hell out of SA :D . I will see you later or I will see you on another time . 
< PROPFIRST > Tosh would be jealous of my new sweater vest that I acquired today . ; X Heck , I'm jealous of myself . Okay , now I'm going to Beorne . 
Can't believe I lost my phone charger while it wasn't even in my possession D: & I wonder what I'ma do tonight ? ...... Hmmmm 
' We bonded over the Fugees .... Fugees and Funyuns . ' 
I want a pretty lady . :[ 
This sucks ! xO 
Mmmm , ' bout to get my Hibache on ! Speaking of , my little green book needs to be fed tonight . 
I'm always thinking one step ahead ...... Like someone who makes stairs . 
g'night , cruel world . 
Everything gets better . 
I like pleasure spiked with pain . 
Another all nighter . :O At least my apartment looks amazing now , thanks to teamwork ! . & you know what else ? I'm tired of worrying about making others happy . If you can't enjoy something , then that's all you , pal . My words aren't going to make you feel any better until you want to be better , yourself . I've had quite enough , thank you . :] 
FINALLY , I've got a/c & our place is lookin ' sexy . There's so much room for activities .... :D 
Even better : Tosh . 0 will be airing 12 episodes this Sunday !! & < PROPFIRST > will not be wearing fruit costumes in the new season . Good choice , Tosh . Good choice . 
Trust me , it's paradise . This is where the hungry come to feed , for mine is the generation that circles the globe for something they've never tried before . So , never refuse an invitation , never resist the unfamiliar , never refuse to be polite , & never outstay your welcome . Just keep your mind open & suck in the experience . ... And if it hurts , you know what ? It's probably worth it . 
I don't feel here . 
The age old question arises .... ' Where did this large bruise on my leg come from ? .... o.O ' Anywho , my feet are killing me . I can't believe we both have our jobs still . I'ma sleep like a baby tonight ... Oh , & drink Minotaur . 
I was blinded by the escape . Where am I ? 
I really can't stand my sleep schedule . I'm beginning to look like a racoon . :/ I do love < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > though ... Not the actor , the cat . 
You say I can't get to the Tree of Life without the sword . Well , how the hell am I supposed to find a sword when the local shop doesn't < PROPFEMALE > anything but sticks & wooden goods , & I've been to everyone's house already !?!?!? >:O ..... I'm beginning to think the sword doesn't exist . 
... I must seem easy or something . People try so hard it's ridiculous & upsetting , I'ma nap . ;D 
Oh an . I had a dream I was the preacher at this church who believed in Marijuana . [ I don't even like smoking that much ... ] Anywho , this group of 3 kids came in . They were starving and homeless , so , naturally , I gave them canned goods and a home . Well , one of them , the boy , hadn't eaten for so long that he had lost sight of all reality . 
I miss my best friend terribly . :[ This sucks . 
Retrospection reminds me of why this happened in the first place . Secondly , if there is a God , this will happen . Thirdly , I want to sing forever . Fourth , I burned my kitchen floor . Fifth , I'm missing the beauty in things . Sixth , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > needs to come visit me once I move -- Like , ASAP . Seventh , i <3 my roomie . Eighth , my < PROPFIRST > Bowie poster scares me now . Ninth , well , I forgot what the ninth thing was . 
Wow , I am absolutely fucked . 
I ain't made'a magic ! 
I much prefer my , ' wake up at 3:00 p.m. , go to bed at 9:00 a.m. , ' schedule . Nap time unless you have something better for me . And blueberries are gross . The book is in !!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D 
:'( 
Softball + My Custom < PROPFIRST > , poolside ? I think so ! Text me , ' cause I don't swim !! 
Feelin ' healthy , but exhausted . Hopefully I'll get some meat in me tonight ! .... Don't even . 
igeev^ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
And as the slight breeze came from the hills , stirring the leaves , the stillness , this extraordinary quality of silence was not disturbed . The house was between the hills & the sea . And as you watched the sea , so very still , you really became a < PROPMALE > of everything . 
maybe if I were a dad I wouldn't be so damn bored today . D: 
Austin-bound !! Xihopetheyhavemywallet .... X 
Don't know what it might be . Don't know what it is , yo . 
When in doubt , I'll try the Sparkly Eyes technique . 
These two worlds will exist simultaneously without ever meeting . 
I think I want to be a witch . Dang , I love The Craft . 
Why would you be afraid of anything ? That's just silly . The storm inside of me is passing & I dig it . 
Woke up in a frantic and mentally violated state . 
It ain't no sin to take off your skin & dance around in your bones . 
No escape . Ugh . 
It's your feet when you're walking . 
twisted stomach knots . D: 
I've been in this apartment for way too long . I'm going crazy & I need to get out asap . 
Un-tss Un-tss Un-tss Un-tss Un-tss 
Phone's off for a while . August means amelioration . 
Oh , absence . You're a son of a bitch .

I love being stood up . -.- At least I have Real & < PROPMALE > , haha . 
Oh , what I'd do . 
My business is to create . 
IH8 DK . 
I'm so happy they're playing SNL on VH1 every night now . Also , I want to start playing disc golf now that the weather is awesome . Does anyone have any suggestions on where to get them or which ones to get ? 
It was the eggrolls . 
Ah , rough . Just the way your mother likes it , Trebek . 
Also , fuck breathalizers . 
I don't wanna be stuck out here on the west side . I just wanna go out and play tonight . 
blank . 
I really need to stop doing this , ' last-minute costume , ' bit . :( 
Man , this weather is straight romance . <3 
BMTH tonight , but not for meeeee . Secondly , I didn't get my check , so no Amazon.com shopping for me tonight either . Double :( On a good note , at least I don't have to see my new dickhead of a boss today . Oh , the little things . :) 
Almost everyday I slice my eye-hole open and I wonder , how does it heal so quickly ? 
Does anyone have any good suggestions on books or movies to get of Amazon ?? 
What's the point of showering if I'm just gonna put on my dirty-ass work clothes ? Yuck , I feel like an old , moldy , piece of chicken . Lastly , thank you , Conan O ' Brien , for completely making my week last night ! Kudos on bringing < PROPMALE > Richter back , but please , get a hold of < PROPMALE > Weinberg again . Oh , and thanks for making me realize that I think < PROPMALE > Rogen is kind of horribly uninteresting . xoxo 
I feel like dancin ' . 
Time for work , where I learn oh , so much . 
Sometimes I forget that I have the strength of two men ; I've forgotten a lot of things . 
Adventures with < PROPFEMALE > , yeeeaaahhhh ! 
Had an absolute blast in < PROPFIRST > last night , & just as much fun today . I got my glasses finally & I'm one step closer to where I want to be . :) 
Woo , got the job at CoCo Lounge ! At least , I think . Either way , I start Saturday :D . #2 
Work at 10 . Man , I hope I'm not too sleepy to kickass tonight . 
I need SOMETHING . This just won't do anymore . :'( 
What a cold & dreary day off . I can't wait to play some pool tonight though ! ( Everyone should definitely join . ) Also , someone should take me to get some soup ' cause I have the sniffles . :'( 
gosh , I really don't feel like working tonight . Bed , I'll see you around 2am . ugh . 
Take a little walk when the worst is to come , when I saw you looking like I never thought . & say you're at a loss or forgot that words can do more than harm . The town is gonna talk , but these people do not see things through to the very minimal . 
Watching 16 & Pregnant makes me feel like I have a heart made of ice and no soul to match , l o l . Time to go make some monie$ . seeya . 
This is surreal . These next few months are going to be ridiculous . Oh , anticipation ! 
Only day off this week . Just bought my Spring Love ticket , so let me know if any off you guys are going , too ! Now , it's time for some good ol ' fashion mall exploring . 
I've been gone . I miss you guys . 
When in doubt , spit it out . 
Not sure how to fill up my birthday weekend . 
When you are flying around & around the world and I'm lying here lonely , I know there's something sacred and free reserved and received by me only . Nobody knows it , but you've got a secret smile and you use it only for me . 
I can't say that I'm not happy . < PROPFIRST > in April , head in the right place , eyes open , and the unleashing of something that I'll never be crazy enough to lock back up . 
Additionally , shoot me , because I have Bieber fever as of last night . :/ 
All this predetermined < PROPFEMALE > makes me want to vomit . 
Oh , also , would anyone like to go to ACL with me this year ? I'm talkin ' all 3 days , straight up enjoyin ' and absorbin ' everything it has to offer . 
Fierce . 
So full it hurts to breathe . D: 
Afternoon nostalgia ? It's on . 
Come see me at\ 
Bdubz tonight ! ;) 
At buffalos . Really don't . Feel like working . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , gtfo . 
I'm gonna become the BEST at pool & take everyone's money , ( I'm getting damn close & If anyone ever wants to go play , let me know . I am down ANYtime , ) replace sodapop with yoga , and find myself a nice girl . Shouldn't be too hard , right ? 
I just jump-roped a mozzerella stick . Sweet ! 
Milkshakes & The Cheesecake Factory in my favorite city with the Buffalo girls :) 
I thank god I've been blessed with a patient mind . Because what I want to happen won't happen for a very long time . Now , my only company's this half full glass of wine . 
You're something I've never seen before . You're the sweetest drug , oh girl . But I'm telling you one thing . Don't you try to control me , no . 
I wasn't aware that people still watch wrestling ...... Dumb . 
Tacos y Margaritas . When did I get so Mexican ? :O 
Tonight is easily the most hilarious night I've had in a while . Looooooooove it ! 
I think I'm evil . 
Today is awesome and I feel social . Hit me up , yo ! ;) 
I am SO ready to dance until 5am . Saturday , scooch on over here next to me . ;) 
One ring to rule them all ..... 
@ < PROPMALE > McClain has made my night & quite possibly my summer . <3<3<3 I need to get off this godforsaken thing now . G'night , everybody . 
Pre-gaming at < PROPFIRST>'s ..... This may have been a bad idea . ;p 
5 hours of sleep ? I guess it'll have to do . Day2 commence , haha . 
My entire body is sore for so many different reasons and I think I'm realizing , that by some terrible miracle , I've changed my mind . So pissed , ha . 
Absolutely scrumtrillescent . 
I make alot of mistakes . Fuck , I make so many . I like to sit and watch them unravel . Consequences , there are plenty .
