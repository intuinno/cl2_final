\Why do I feel as if I'm drifting further & further away from you & that you seriously annoys the hell outta me at times recently ? \"" 
' s love for you knows no boundaries , so no matter how irrinoying you can be , she will still love you , provided you don't step on her when she's on her sympathetic division mode ! :D 
Selamat Hari Embek Embeeeek to everyone ! :D 
\You can’t measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange . \"" 
Can anyone tell me why common tests are invented ? To rack our brains or whaaaat ? As if exams don't cause enough damage already . Sucha hassle wassle . Zzzz

Je ne peux pas attendre < PROPMALE > vraies vacances pour commencer . :D 
Oh yeah , attachy's over , welcome to DOOMSLAND 2nd batch ! * evil grin * 
Gosh , believe it or not , life is INDEED unpredictable cuz you never know what's in store for you the next day . Gee . 
simply cannot comprehend how a guy's brain functions in a relationship & thinks that someone has to invent a dummy guide for it . 
' s joints are screaming in pain from all the excessive headbanging & kneeling . Thank God her head did not just get detached & roll all over the floor ! 
( And again , another day of training passes by , leaving me in the agony of muscle aches . Repeat mode . ) 
Alright Srinadi & Titisan Temasek , tomorrow is the preview , so let's give our best , our 100% or more if possible wokay ? Let's rock the studio down ! :D 
I cannot comprehend as to why there's a BIG commotion regarding who's being crowned the Spore Idol . It's already happened & nobody can ever change the fact that Sezairi won , so why bother ? Lol . 
What I definitely hope for 2010 is that everyone will be blessed with loads of luxury & euphoria till there's no room for poverty & lachrymal people . Miracles don't happen , but I do believe that if I wished hard enough , maybe a < PROPFEMALE > will < PROPMALE > my wishes . <3 
When you’re young , your whole life is about the pursuit of fun . Then you grow up & learn to be cautious . You could break a bone or a heart . You look before you leap & sometimes , you don’t leap at all cuz there’s not always someone there to catch you . In life there’s no safety net . When did it stop being fun & start being scary ? 
Frankly speaking , I believe the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are . Good mood , bad mood , ugly , pretty , handsome , what have you . The right person will still think the sun shines outta your ass . That’s the kind of person that’s worth sticking with . <3 
No words can describe how overwhelmed I was with lachrymosity when my patient passed away just now & I'm the last person in contact with him . One moment he's perfectly fine , another moment he's lifeless . Goodness gracious ! ): 
Facebook makes the world seem smaller than it already is . Like everyone else knows everyone else . It gets pretty annoying as time goes by . Really I swear . Sheesh ! 
Before you judge me , take a good look at you . Don't you have anyth better to do ? Seems to me , you're slow to comprehend that jealousy & ignorance go hand in hand . <3 
Yes , we shed tears , suffer the same torment , bear the same grudges but ultimately , we forge a closer bond & share loads of laughter , fun plus joy . So here's the deal lovelies , LET'S SHINE TOMORROW ! <3 
Everything seems to be in a flurry now & I feel like I'm on the world's most emotional rollercoaster . * insert what I'm supposed to be feeling * 
The organ that differentiates a human being & an animal is the brain , sadly many people don't seem to make full use of the advantage . * sighs * 
ASSignments are really killing me ; meeting deadlines is another monster . Boohoohoo ! 
Counting down the number of days left before the real showdown ; so many things to do , so little time . PANIC MODE . 
My weekends are seriously gonna ROCK swell time . I have great company , awesome happy pills & my love of my life ; can life get any better than this ? :D 
ZOMG ! After tons of incessant & intensive training , the day has finally arrived . LET'S ROCK ESPLANADE DOWN GUYS , for real ! :D :D :D 
Had a blast during our first ever attempt in front of the audience . Woo I savour every moment I have with the Jiwo-Jiroians . Hope it lasts . <3 
All good things had to come to an end , but why so quickly ? I wish to rewind all those moments that we had together again . Well done everyone , we were awesome ! :D 
Oh gosh I'm like suffering from the post production blues like < PROPMALE > time ! I miss my Jiwo Jiroians . Boohoo ! 
It's pretty an irony when the things that we anticipate to end so eagerly ends up being one of those things that's the hardest to let go of . Catch my drift ? 
' s head is spinning & twirling like a top due to incessant assignments . Sheesh ! 
NAFAS NABUNG IS LOVED . <3 
\Setiap jiwa itu harus dijaga & dibelai ; kita < PROPFEMALE > memikul tanggungjawab ini . Translation : Every soul has to be well taken care of & cherished ; we are responsible for our very own souls . \ " <3 " 
ZOMG ! Guess what guys ? I touched a real life tarantula & it feels like carpet ! Lol . 
I wish I wish I could live in Avatar land where everything is glowing & awesome . I can make friends with Eywa & she'll < PROPMALE > all my wishes . :D 
If you can’t handle me at my worst , then you don’t deserve me at my best . 
“Live your life day by day . You never know when your time will come , so live at every hour , laugh at every minute , and love at every second . ” 
Asshole with the long sideburns . Sheesh ! 
\Life only demands from you the strength you possess . Only one feat is possible ?? not to have run away . \"" 
FYP really surfaces majority of the students hypocrisy & two-faced backstabbing attitude . Sad world . Catch my drift ? 
BONDING CAMP , here I comeeeeeeeeee . I'm so excited , I'm jumping for joy . Lol . 
Jiwo Jiroians , I'm over at the loft right now , reliving & reminiscing all the memories that we left here once before . Wish you guys were here . 
What's with people & korean bands ? I don't even understand their language . Lol . 
What if I say that I'm in love all over again ? * ponders * 
Dear Practical Test < PROPFEMALE > , let me pass my NSL prac test this coming thursday with flying colours . :D 
Everybody has problems . Everybody has bad times . Do we sacrifice all the good times because of them ? I rather not . :D 
Oh yeah , a well done for my practical test really made my day today , hope the goodness lasts throughout ! Woo . 
Man , I dig eating Oreo cookies with milk like totally ! Yum yum yum . :D 
Someone please create a \I hate the new facebook layout cuz it's fugly & super UNuser-friendly\ " fan < PROPFEMALE > cuz i dno how to create one . Boohoo ! " 
1000 words of bullshit , here I come . Lol . 
I love Herwanny < PROPMALE > for helping me in my ELAHA assignment & dear Hafizukiz Zukiz baby , hope that ELAHA is being an angel for you ! <3 
Why is it when I'm good to some people , I get offensive treatments in return ? This world is purely unfair . Boohoo ! 
Oh God , what should I study for NSL SAQ test later on ? Stump , neurovascular , traction or what ? Sheesh ! 
Wondering ... When i get older losing my hair many years from now , will you still need me ? Will you still feed me when I'm sixty four ? 
Oh damn the mensy cramps . Hurts like crazy & with PAS presentation in approximately two hours , I'm dead meat . TSK ! 
\Any man can love a million girls . But it takes a real man one to love one girl a million ways . \ " <3 " 
You are a strange & magnificent creature & you have enchanted me completely . <3 
ZOMG ! I don't know what's with some Malay girls & their fetish for tarnishing their reputation nowadays . I guess they just don't get the definition of dignity . Sad . 
Life sucks currently . Period . 
\Expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are good is like expecting the bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian . \ " Zzzzzz " 
Exam mode , well not so into it but yeah . Lol . 
Dear 2.2 s , let's give our best for tomorrow's paper alrighty ? We can do it , that I'm confident . :D 
\I’m tired of all this nonsense about beauty being only skin-deep . That’s deep enough . What do you want—an adorable pancreas ? \ " Lol . " 
Is < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > a wicked watch ? 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day is kind of a < PROPMALE > letdown cuz firstly , there ain't a story line & secondly , < PROPFIRST > Swift looked so awkward on the screen . Zzzzzz 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was no doubt an awesomely rocking show . I wished I was < PROPFEMALE>'s daughter cuz she's so damn pretty . <3 
You see , you closed your eyes . That was the difference . Sometimes you cannot believe what you see , you have to believe what you feel . And if you are ever going to have other people trust you , you must feel that you can trust them , too—even when you’re in the dark . Even when you’re falling . 
\People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use . \ " Agreed ? Cuz I totally vouch for that . " 
\I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls . \ " <3 " 
A girl should be two things : classy & fabulous . :D 
< PROPFIRST > ROAD's mutton chop is like the best mutton chop I've ever tasted . Woo ! :D 
Mentally challenged at IMH , please don't give me an arduous time for the whole of next week will you ? If you behave , I'll tell the nurses there to give you chocolate biscuits . :D 
Attachment gave me creeps & the \I don't wanna come tomorrow\ " feeling . It's just a bad first time experience . Geez . " 
Eh hello I rather that you cut the < PROPMALE > , save your breath & admit that you're just a fucking hypocritical racist than beat around the bush spouting bullshit . GRR ! 
I realised that all this Korean artistes have taken my friends by tsunami , avalanche , earthquake , blizzard , sandstorm - anything but storm cuz storm seemed to be an \underword\ " . Catch my drift ? " 
Vietnam , here I come . 060310-190310 . Miss me when I'm gone . I gotta feeling that the trip is gonna be rocking cuz of the awesome company . :D 
HELLO SINGAPORE , GOODBYE HANOI ! Awesome memories & company . Gonna miss everything hell loads ! :D 
Now now what should I wear for tomorrow's function ? Err . 
I truly miss the kids back at Bac Giang province . Wanna see their smiles again & receive all the warmth of their embrace . :( 
ZOMG watching all the candid & random YEP musical videos that people tagged me tickles my laughing bone to the maximum . Everyone were so atrociously hyped up like no one's business . Lol . 
This is real hilarious : \All women's trouble in life are all because of one stupid chromosome that decided to be different . \ " Lol . " 
Gosh I'm like so freaking bored outta my mind . So damn lazy to do the case study . 
Are there any interesting places in Singapore that I can visit besides those that I already know ? Any recommendations ? 
Define digitally penetrate in a child abuse case cuz I'm kinda clueless . 
The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves , and not to twist them to fit our own image . Otherwise we only love the reflections of ourselves that we find in them . <3 
\Maybe some women aren't meant to be tamed . Maybe they just need to run free till they find someone just as wild to run with them . \"" 
Nothing beats the awesome company of Hafizukiz Zukiz , he's truly my sunshine . Cliche , but it's just frankly speaking . <3 
Can someone please help explain what the hell PRCP is all about cuz I'm like clueless here , thanks a million . 
If you keep on judging others , you won't even have the time to love anyone . 
I don't know if you've ever noticed this , but first impressions are often entirely wrong . You can look at a painting for the first time , for example , and not like it at all , but after looking at it a little longer you may find it very pleasing ... Your initial opinion on just about anything may change over time . 
Sitting in the NSL lab alone , freezing to death & fearing each moment that there's a slight possibility that the mannequins might move & harm her or something . 
So tomorrow is the pinnacle of witnessing whether all of our hard work all these while had been fruitful . I gotta feeling that FOC 2010 is going be an awesome blast . :D 
Soaking wet from top to toe now , freezing but the day was aweeeeesome ! :D 
I can proudly pronounce that nothing can beat the thrills of this year's FOC Ancient Egypt 2010 ; a job aweeesomely done by all of you guys . :D 
Being popular doesn't mean that you're beautiful , sometimes people just wanna have a share of your fame . 
I can never ask for more being in the HS family , <3 my committee , delegates & freshies bits to pieces ; you guys are aweeeesome , keep rocking yeah ! :D 
My spirits for next week ain't gonna be dampen by the fact that I'm already in Year 3 ( Sucks balls , I know ) cuz it is all overwhelmed by the fact that I'm gonna see the lovelies at the post FOC gathering . So who's with me ? :D 
Sometimes you need to step outside , get some air & remind yourself of who you are & where you want to be . 
I'm lonely . Why do you think I had to learn to act so independent ? I also get mad too quickly , and I hog the covers , and my second toe is longer than my big one . My hair has it's own zip code . Plus , I get certifiably crazy when I've got PMS . You don't love someone because they're perfect . You love them in spite of the fact that they're not . 
I have never ever , I repeat never ever even bothered to visit the discussion boards in my < PROPMALE > pages , but since there are participation marks awarded , I'm forced to do so . Judging by the humongous amount of replies , I'm pressurized as to how to answer those questions that the lecturers have posted cuz the rest wrote compositions like < PROPMALE > time . Grr . 
Everything is gonna be alright , be strong , believe . 
I feel like supercalifragilisticexpialidocious . 
There are some things way important than your social climbing agenda , period . 
I love you without knowing how , or when , or from where . I love you straightforwardly , without complexities or pride ; so I love you because I know no other way . <3 
Mom always tells me to celebrate everyone's uniqueness . I like the way that sounds cuz everyone is beautiful in their own single way . :D 
Memories are like a still life painted by ten different student artists : some will be blue-based ; others red ; some will be as stark as Picasso and others as < PROPMALE > as Rembrandt ; some will be foreshortened and others distant . Recollections are in the eye of the beholder ; no two held up side by side will ever quite match . 
The public has an insatiable curiosity to know everything , except what is worth knowing . There's a reason why \Mind Your Own Business\ " is part of the vocabulary . Tsk . " 
Expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are good , is like expecting the bull not to charge because you are a vegetarian . Lol . 
If you can't razzle them with dazzle , baffle them with bullshit . Lol . 
For beautiful eyes , look for the good in others ; for beautiful lips , speak only words of kindness ; and for poise , walk with the knowledge that you are never alone . <3 
Music is a total constant . That's why we have such a strong visceral connection to it , you know ? Because a song can take you back instantly to a moment , or a place , or even a person . No matter what else has changed in you or the world , that one song says the same , just like that moment . 
Why do we trust one another so little ? I know there must be a reason , but still I sometimes think it's horrible that you find you can never really confide in people , even in those who are nearest to you . Speaks volume isn't it ? 
I totally have no effing idea why some people are not even half pretty or are they kind-hearted but people worship them as if the sun shines from their asses . Lol . 
One thing about being on top of the world ... it gives you a long , long way to fall . Agreed ? 
A well dressed woman , though her purse may be painfully empty , can conquer the world . <3 
Kindness in words create confidence , kindness in thinking creates profoundness & kindness in giving creates love . <3 
Love is always patient and kind . It is never jealous . Loves is never boastful or conceited . It is never rude or selfish . It dose not take offense and is not resentful . Love take no pleasure in others people's sins , but delights in the truth . It is always ready to excuse , to trust , to hope , and to endure whatever comes . 
Feelings never do make sense . They get you all confused . Then they drive you around for hours before they drop you right back where you started . 
Literature review is like the finest form of bullshit that can ever exist around here , right now . Oooh I love literature review . <3 
LITERATURE REVIEW IS LIKE THE NEW SEXY , WOO ! <3 * hint hint sarcasm * 
There is no such thing as the perfect soulmate . If you meet someone & you think they're perfect , you better run as fast as you can in the other direction , cuz your soulmate is the person that pushes your buttons , pisses you off on a regular basis & makes you face your shit . 
I contend that every woman has the right to feel beautiful , no matter how scrambled her features , or how indifferent her features are . <3 
Everyone is like a butterfly , they start out ugly & awkward but then morph into beautiful graceful butterflies that everyone loves . <3 
Words are the most powerful drug used by mankind . 
Style is an expression of individualism mixed with charisma . Fashion is something that comes after style . 
Talk is cheap , but lies are even cheaper . 
The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears , the figure that she carries , or the way she combs her hair . The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes , because that is the doorway to her heart , the place where love resides . <3 
I've never fooled anyone . I've let people fool themselves . They didn't bother to find out who & what I was . Instead they would invent a character for me . I wouldn't argue with them . They were obviously hating somebody I wasn't . 
364 days with you cupcakes , one more day & it'll < PROPFIRST > as one of the milestones that I've achieved in my life . <3 you Hafizukiz Zukiz . 
Maybe there are no right moments , right guys , right answers , maybe sometimes you just have to say what's in your heart . 
There is more to sex appeal than just measurements . I don't need a bedroom to prove my womanliness . I can convey just as much sex appeal , picking apples off a tree or just by standing in the rain . <3 
I have never been a fan of celebrating monthsaries , but for this time time round , it is oh so mandatory cuz it's our first ever anniversary . Happy first anniversary cupcakes , I love you so very much . Thanks for tolerating all my nonsense , for sharing moments of ups & downs with me , for being the best ever boyfriend in the entire universe . Muacks ! <3 <3 <3 
The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead . <3 
Practical test tomorrow . * panic mode * 
People are like stained-glass windows . They < PROPFEMALE > & shine when the sun is out , but when the darkness sets in , their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within . Totally agreed . 
No one can make you inferior without your consent , so be hell appreciative with what you possess now . 
Assumptions are the root of all diabolical hatred in the world . Know your things , then talk . Don't talk your head off without thinking . The only organ that differentiates a human being from an animal is a brain , so why don't you start to utilise it well ? 
If you had an ounce of self-esteem , of self-worth , of self-confidence , you would realize that , as trite as it may sound , beauty is truly skin deep . <3 
Tomorrow marks the end of common test for the year 3's who are currently taking NURM . Best of luckies & break a leg cuz we sure have one chunk of memorization to do ! :D 
Life is actually real simple , but we decided to make it complicated . I suggest that we learn to love ourselves first before it is made illegal . 
Was totally amused when my grandma questioned the worth of being a soccer fanatic since according to her , it's tantamount to watching people chasing for a pathetic ball & tryna score into a net-like container . Lol . 
I <3 my boyfriend very much . I don't wanna share him with any girls , INCLUDING gays . Eew whatever happened to him yesterday is damn disgusting , totally . 
I won't tell anybody how you turn my world around , I won't tell anyone how your voice is my favourite sound . <3 
Everyone is speaking in World Cup language & hell I don't even comprehend any of them . Maybe if I'm lucky , I managed to recognize some names , other than that , it's all alien language . Man , I guess I'm only interested in the winner . Lol . 
I'm feeling hell vexed . I cannot even change my background for my formspring . The stupid system kept saying invalid request what bullshit . Any kind soul wanna step forward & lend a helping hand ? I need large doses of that seriously , thank you . 
I don't like people who have never fallen or stumbled . Their virtue is lifeless & it isn't of much value . Life hasn't revealed its beauty to them yet . 
Define beauty . 
Missi Nisa , < PROPFEMALE > Nurfazila , Herwanny < PROPMALE > , Fee Losophy , Aishah Kamsani , Nurulhaziyah Ziziee & Ekynn Nnyke , I think I'm gonna join in the fun on the upcoming Tuesday gathering cuz my trip is cancelled . Say what ? YAY ! We're totally gonna have an awesome Happy Pills time together . Oh wait , am I invited ? Lol . 
Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option . Things can only work out when they're on equilibrium , trust me . 
I have the best girlfriends in the whole entire universe & also an awesome boyfriend , do you ? 
L'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle . <3 
Hey so I gotta a question . Do you wanna have a party in my basement ? Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum ? Is my love your drug ? 
ZOMG . THE LAST TIME I HEARD PORTUGAL SCORED 7-0 AGAINST N . KOREA ? I love you Cristiano Ronaldo baby . Come back early , will be waiting for you at home . Lol . 
It has been said that time heals all wounds . I do not totally agree with the statement . The wounds remain . In time , the mind , protecting its sanity , covers them with scar tissue & the pain lessens , but it is never completely gone . 
Afiq Ashraf , < PROPFEMALE > Nurfazila , Herwanny < PROPMALE > , Muhammad Azuan , Muhammad < PROPFEMALE > Bin < PROPFIRST > , Hafizukiz Zukiz , thanks for the awesome night spent the last two days . You guys are rocking ! <3 
I think if I've learned anything about friendship , it's to < PROPFEMALE > in , stay connected , fight for them & let them fight for you . Don't walk away , don't be distracted , don't be too busy or tired , don't take them for granted . Friends are part of the glue that holds life & faith together . Powerful stuff . 
Cuz you are the only exception . <3 
People are lonely cuz they build walls instead of bridges . 
I wish I wish with all my might that tomorrow marks the first day of vacation . That'll be infinity awesome ! Fat hope ! Lol . 
You're something between a dream & a miracle . <3 
You know what ? All your statuses screams attention & they're for sure helluva fake . Ask you something . Are you made in < PROPFEMALE > woman ? Totally . 
Beauty is power ; a smile is its sword . <3 
We are all , stars & we deserve to twinkle . <3 
Fee Losophy , < PROPFEMALE > Nurfazila , Herwanny < PROPMALE > , Missi Nisa , Aishah Kamsani , Nurulhaziyah Ziziee & Ekynn Nnyke , plan a girly day out this week or the next pretty please ? Over the weekends or something ? I miss you guys terribly already . Sobs . 
MUMMY I WANT A POLAROID CAMERA PRETTY PLEASE ! 
I always think that shopping is cheaper than a psychiatrist , period . :D 
Life's too awesome to waste your time thinking about someone who doesn't treat you right . Agreed ? 
Hangovers are the wrath of grapes . Catch my drift ? Lol . 
I know everyone is hell pressurized & damn shagged with FYP , but seriously , everyone is suffering from the same burden . Here's the deal , why don't we finish it once & for all instead of pulling such long faces . Pulling long faces is damn unhealthy you know , research says so & it's scientifically proven . :D 
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment cuz you are true to yourself , not fake or hypocritical . 
Don't just fit in , but stand out & let the world see what you've got ! :D 
Everyone is beautiful in their own unique way . Not in how you look or how you act , but just being who you are . Be true to yourself is the trick . <3 
ZOMG why on earth should my birthday fall on a week when everything is on panic mode & when all the < PROPMALE > assignments are due ? Someone please shoot me . I think I should postpone my bday to next year & have a proper one . Sheesh . 
The only way to get what you really want , is to know what you really want . And the only way to know what you really want , is to know yourself . And the only way to know yourself , is to be yourself . And the only way to be yourself is to listen to your heart . <3 
I am indeed overwhelmed by sheer euphoria with the immense birthday wishes , surprises & hugs that I've gotten today . I really had a blast , thanks a million everyone for making this girl a special kid on her birthday . Hopefully , tomorrow I can ace my FYP presentation & practical test . Need loadsa luckies for that . <3 
< PROPMALE > between us wrap like a noose around me , I'm choking for you . <3 
Everywhere I go , I see people tapping enthusiastically on their iPhone . I don't have an iPhone , so does that make me a loser ? Lol . 
DANG ! To think I was that imbecile to be fooled into believing that AskJud is the real deal of a virtual tarot . * knocks head * 
I ain't a fighter , I'm a lover , but I'll sure as hell fight for my love . <3 
I hereby proclaim that July babies are rockingly awesome ! Cheers to all Cancerians . <3 
It's official . My mum chopped my hair till it's shoulder length . I have mixed emotions about the hair loss . I can foresee myself being labelled ugly tomorrow in school . God , I need your help . Sheesh . 
Mummy says I look like < PROPFEMALE > with my new haircut . Lol much . 
Sometimes I may be selfish , impatient & insecure . I make mistakes , I'm out of control & at times , hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst , then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best . Thank you very nice . 
In life we all have an unspeakable secret , an irreversible regret , an unreachable dream & an unforgettable love . <3 
Spiteful words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks the heart . Sobs . 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . <3 
Distance makes the heart grows much fonder , then you'll realize how much you love your partner . Speaks volume . 
Wit is educated insolence , you gather that ? * winks * 
What does a boy expect from a girl in a relationship ? Just curious , so bring on the answers . Lol . 
Eat , Pray , Love . Absolute reading bliss . <3 
For this Ramadhan , I strive to be as pious a Muslim can be whenever possible & aim to get in shape . I can do it , insyallah . God bless . 
It's easy to look at people & make quick judgements about them , their present & their past , but you'd be amazed at the pain & tears a single smile can hide . What a person shows to the world is only one < PROPFEMALE > facet of the iceberg hidden from sight . And more often than not , it's lined with cracks & scars that go all the way to the foundation of their soul . 
I wanna meet someone who treats me the way I deserve to be treated . Like the sun rises & sets with me . I don't wanna feel any pain or agony . I want every passing day to be full of love , genuine love . 
Yes , I might look that I ain't the most gregarious ( friendly ) person around in school , but trust me , if I know you well , I can be the most irritating & loud person that you can ever meet I swear . Just ask my friends , they all agree . Please don't judge a book by its cover , thank you very nice . 
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream . <3 
No relationship is perfect , ever . There are always some ways you have to bend , to compromise , to give something up in order to gain something greater ... The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences . And that's the key . It's like a big pie chart , and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece . Love can make up for a lot . <3 
If you have the privilege to choose a song to describe your love story with your partner , what'll you choose ? I'll definitely take my bet on Teenage Dreams by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . Oooh I'm in love all over again . <3 
I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right , you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . 
< PROPFEMALE > Parikka <3 Fifi Lapin <3 
To be brave is to love someone unconditionally , without expecting anything in return . To just give . That takes a whole lot of courage ; cuz we don't wanna fall on our faces or leave ourselves open to hurt . 
Sometimes , you hafta be apart from those you love , but that doesn't mean you love them any lesser . Sometimes , it even make you love them more . Have you heard the phrase \absence makes the heart grow fonder\ " before ? * winks * " 
Haters are confused admirers who can't comprehend why everybody loves you . They just don't get it . Lol . 
You can't live your life to suit other people . The harder you try , the more restrictions they'll put on you just for the fun of seeing you jump through their hoops . That's how diabolical people can be . 
There comes a time when the world gets quiet & the only sound left is your heart . So you'd better learn the sound of it . Otherwise , you'll never comprehend what it's saying . 
We human beings tend to have so much love to give for everyone . You can love anyone at any point of time , but remember that out of all the love that you have accumulated , your love for Allah S.W.T has to be the greatest , deepest & most sincere . <3 
The best things in life are unseen . That's why we close our eyes when we kiss , cry & dream . <3 
Alright guys , let's rock NS5 tomorrow . All of us are gonna score with flying colours . For now , just cram your memories with whatever notes that you can , get all this done & over fast . After Friday , we can party all night long . Woo ! 
You know what ? NURM can go wash stinky toilet bowls for all I care . Sucky piece of module . My brain refuses to memorize the notes for nuts . It's like NURM is written in alien language . Lol . 
If you wanna be respected by others , the wisest thing you could do is to respect yourself first . Only by self-respect will you compel others to respect you . You gather that ? 
Love never dies a natural death . It dies cuz we dno how to replenish its source . It dies of errors , blindness & betrayals . It dies of illness & wounds ; it dies of weariness , of withering , of tarnishing . 
I'm just so tired of trying my best to please & comprehend other people's feelings , to cater to their needs , but in the end , I'm the one at the losing end . The one who's being hurt incessantly . No matter how sorry people are , they still won't change at all . Sheesh . 
I'm in love with you . I can't promise us a future , or guarantee a perfect one , cuz we're us & I'm me & who knows what might happen in the future . But trust me , in my heart I'm effing sure that I'm in love with you & I hope you're in love with me too . <3 
Don't be reckless with other people's hearts , don't put up with people who are reckless with yours . 
I'm missing Ramadhan already . Why is it gone so soon ? Salam Aidilfitri Maaf Zahir & Batin . This shout out is only for the deserving people who really had a meaningful & blessed Ramadhan . < PROPFEMALE > tak puasa sungguh-sungguh tu , shame on you ! :D 
Who's wearing blue for the first day of Raya , please like this status cuz we JIWA like that . :D 
ATTACHY . TMRW . ME . NO . LIKEY . SUCKY . * shows disgusted face * 
When a man can listen to woman's feelings without getting angry and frustrated , he gives her a wonderful gift . He makes it safe for her to express herself . The more she is able to express herself , the more she feels heard and understood , and the more she is able to give a man the loving trust , acceptance , appreciation , admiration , approval , and encouragement that he needs . 
< PROPFEMALE > is for losers . It's just a stupid excuse to wait for things to happen instead of making them happen . 
You should never give yourself a < PROPMALE > to fall apart cuz when you do , it becomes a propensity & it transpires on repeat mode . You must practice staying strong , instead . 
You can try your hardest , you can do everything & say everything . But sometimes , people aren’t worth trying over anymore . They aren’t worth worrying about . It’s important to know when to let someone go when they’re letting you down . 
My boyfriend's gonna ditch me totally for gym till his NAPHA is over like what , in a month's time ?! How awesome . Now I feel like trading lives with the metal plates for a month . Lol . 
We all remember the fairytales of our childhoods . The shoe fits < PROPFEMALE > , the frog turns into a < PROPMALE > & blah blah . Once upon a time and then they lived happily ever after . The problem is , fairytales don't exist . It’s the nightmares that always seem to become reality . The person who invented the phrase “Happily ever after” should have his ass kicked , so hard . 
I don't want phenomenal love confessions or expensive gifts or romantic moonlight walks or songs you wrote just for me or calls every five minutes to tell me you miss me . I just want YOU . For the rest we'll see . <3 
There is an inner beauty about a woman who believes in herself , who knows she is capable of anything she puts her mind to . There is a beauty in the strength and determination of a woman who follows her own path , who isn’t thrown off by obstacles along the way . There is a beauty about a woman whose confidence comes from experiences who knows she can fall , pick herself up , and go on . <3 
It's weird , like when you’re in love , all of a sudden you’re hearing all of these love songs for the first time , and it feels like the singer is just talking to you alone , reading your mind . When you’re grieving , it’s the same thing . I’m in tune with all the sadness of the world suddenly . You know , songs find you , poems find you , people find you . 
Dear God , if everything that I'm going through right now is just a test of my strength , endurance & to measure the intensity/depth of my love for you , make it end pretty quickly please . I don't think I can prolly endure till the end of this week cuz this is like one of those which puts me in a meagre predicament . Sucking my euphoria away like the Dementors in < PROPMALE > Potter . < PROPMALE > me what's best for me , I <3 you . Amin . 
I love today hell much . Had tons of fun laughing my ass off . Woo ! <3 
Braids , glitter , frozen yogurt , a good book , daydream , florals , jellybeans , polaroid pictures , fleeting moments caught in time , secret glances , bubbles , picnics , sunshine , rain , lace , carousels , endless conversations , empty parantheses of time to fill with everything and nothing , accessories , candycanes , tea , music and lyrics , trust , people , travelling , vintage , macaroons : ME . <3 
Life's all about ass . Everyone’s either covering it , laughing it off , kicking it , kissing it , trying to get a piece of it , or simply just being one . Lol . 
I believe that no matter how many mistakes we've made ; how badly we've really screwed up ; how old , worn out , or dejected we've become ; as long as all of us realise where we've gone wrong , we all have the right to be forgiven & a < PROPMALE > to ameliorate any predicament . Forgiving is a virtue . 
Fee Losophy , Missi Nisa , Aishah Kamsani , Ziziee McKinzie , Herwanny < PROPMALE > , Ekynn Nnyke & < PROPFEMALE > Nurfazila , I can't wait for tmrw . I'm sure each & every one of us are gonna look smoking hot in our outfits . <3 & miss you lovelies hell tons . Muacks ! 
Sometimes , you just need someone who is not only willing to be there for you , but comprehends you & what you’re going through . Someone who you out down your guards & reveal your imperfections . Someone who will never judge you or sway away even from the mistakes you make . Someone who loves you , truly for who you are . One of the greatest gifts in life is having the < PROPMALE > to find someone like that in your life . 
I am overwhelmed with euphoria today . The rendezvous was awesome & I miss it already . Btw , people thought that I chose nursing as a choice in order to get into SIA cabin crew . Like a stepping stone . Lol . 
I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school . They don't teach you how to love somebody . They don't teach you how to be < PROPMALE > or how to be poor . They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer . They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind . They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying . They don't teach you anything worth knowing . 
You don’t hafta always be pretty . You don’t owe prettiness to anyone . Not to your boyfriend/spouse/partner , not to your co-workers , especially not to random men on the street . You don’t owe it to your mother , you don’t owe it to your children , you don’t owe it to civilization in general . Prettiness is not a rent you pay for occupying a space marked “female” cuz all of you are pretty in your own unique ways . <3 
I believe in pink . I believe laughing is the best calorie burner . I believe in kissing , kissing a lot . I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong . I believe that happy girls are the prettiest . I believe that tomorrow’s another day & I believe in miracles . <3 
Somehow I knew we would be friends . We’d have our ups & downs , but when the big things came along , we could work anything out . We’d fight then laugh it off because we learned it wasn’t worth it . We knew that our friendship would make it through anything . It feels like we’ve been friends forever . No matter what , you’ve always been there when I needed you the most , and I love you to death for that . To my Happy Pills . <3 
I like it on < PROPFIRST > Hamilton's < PROPFEMALE > & Chace Crawford's body . How about that ? Lol . 
I've learned in life so far that in reality , this thing called relationship is not what it seems like on teevee , all sugary sweet & no spice . You gotta figure your way out in the whole process , have tons of fun & get hurt at the same time . Frankly speaking , there's no such thing as a knight in shining armour , don't live in delusion . If he's the one for you , he just is . InsyAllah , the rest God will decide . 
Women are like tea bags ; you never know how strong they are until they're put in hot water . <3 
People question why life is sometimes so full of pain . Well , without pain , would we learn how to appreciate euphoria ? Would people learn from their mistakes ? Would people learn how to pick themselves up after they fall ? Sometimes pain is the best teacher and through the pain , we learn how to show kindness to others . 
Yay ! Attachment over in a weeks ' time . Awesome possum ! To all the year threes , jiayou ! Gotta fight till the end . 
The bottom line is , life is about learning , whether you're in school or not . We are mere mortals , human beings . We make mistakes . But your lowest moment might also be the one where you begin to rise & rise . So double back . Regroup . Brush yourself off & try again . :D 
It really doesn't matter about your apearance or height . So what if your too fat , too thin , short , tall , ugly or pretty ? All that matters is what's in your heart and what you want . People who tease you are dumb cuz they themselves are not perfect . So , just be yourself and don't listen to what others say . Like they say , you're born an original , don't die a copy . <3 
Learn to value yourself , which means : fight for your happiness . So I'm going out there & strive for the best that I can . I'm gonna face tons of obstacles , but I'm gonna keep going . I'm gonna reach as far as I can , for every thing I've ever wanted & I ain't giving up . Cuz that's what you do when your dreams are more imperative than your fears . You go out there , ignore the odds & focus on making your dreams come true . <3 
I am a < PROPFEMALE > , all girls are in fact . Even if they live in < PROPFEMALE > , old , desolated musty attics . Even if they're dressed in rags , even if they aren't gorgeous , smart or young . They're still < PROPFEMALE > es . All of us . <3 
Promise yourself to be strong . Look at the < PROPFEMALE > side of everything and make your optimism come true . Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future . Give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others . Live in the faith that the whole world is on your side as long as you are true to the best that is in you . <3 
It is better to live your own < PROPFEMALE > imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else's life with perfection . <3 
Life is like a rainbow . You need both , the sun & the rain to make its colours appear . <3 
I have no regrets in my life . I think that everything transpires to you exactly for a reason cuz you don't knw what Life/God has in store for you . The predicaments that you go through builds your character , making you a much more stronger individual . Don't be debilitated . <3 
To all my dearest friends who are down with God knows how many kinds of diseases , I pray that all the meanie viruses/bacteria will stop terrorizing your immune system & go away for good . May all of you have a speedy recovery . Sleep well , have enough rest , hydrate yourself regularly & most imperatively , take your meddy no matter how bitter they are . <3 you guys , JIAYOU ! :D 
Tomorrow is Friday , in other words , if I go through tomorrow , I would have successfully completed my 3.2 attachment . Woo six weeks flew just like that baby ! Congrats to all who made this far . You excited for tomorrow ? Cuz I sure as hell am . Yay ! :D 
Ahhhhh I can already inhale the saccharine smell of vacation wafting through my nostrils . Lol . Hooray ! 
We're not perfect . Any of us . We make mistakes , we screw up , but then we forgive & we move forward . <3 
Don’t waste your time caring abt the people who don’t like you or those talking behind you cuz they're just jealous . Waste your time with friends . Live for the moment , laugh often , be immature , do anyth&everyth . If it’s smth you’ll regret in the morning , sleep late & when you wake up , laugh about it with your friends , cuz your friends are what matter most . When you have your friends , you have everything . <3 
I can't comprehend why some human beings , even after being granted the capacity of intelligence to think , are bothered to trash talk about other people . I mean come on , it's everyone else's right to do anything that they want , so long they don't meddle in your affairs . You can just freaking keep your thoughts to yourself . The best thing , some people behaves like \pot calling the kettle black\ " . Catch my drift ? Lol . " 
The one that is meant for us is usually the hardest to get , keep & accept cuz through all that the love will grow stronger . Love wasn't made to be easy , otherwise we wouldn't end up with the right person . We would end up with the first one who comes along . By struggling , we single out the wrong ones & realise who really is the one . <3 
I have become my own version of an optimist . If I can't make it through one door , I'll go through another door - or I'll make a door . Something terrific will come no matter how dark the present . <3 
On days when you beat yourself up over any regrets , always remember that life isn’t about all the mistakes you make , it’s about what you learn while you’re picking yourself back up from them . Woo . 
I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they go right , you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart , so that better things can fall together . <3 
Never take someone for granted . Hold every person close to your heart , cuz you might wake up one day & realize you've lost a < PROPFEMALE > , while you were busy collecting stones . <3 
Mistakes are a part of being human . Appreciate mistakes for what they are : precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way . <3 
< PROPFEMALE > yourself like a < PROPFEMALE > & you'll attract a < PROPMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > yourself like a hoe & see how far you'll go . xxxx 
Beauty should not be judged from a pretty face , but from a pretty mind , a pretty heart & a pretty soul . <3 
? Single ? Taken ? Feelin’ So Fly Like A G6 . <3 
Being single used to mean that nobody wanted you . Now it means you’re pretty , sexy , & you’re taking your time deciding how you want your life to be & who you want to spend it with . <3 
The only way to get through life & its unpredictable predicaments is to laugh your way through it . You either have to laugh or cry . I prefer to laugh . Crying gives me a headache . <3 
Let your heart not be hardened by the people who treat it without care , instead let your heart grow stronger , bigger , to love more those who do . <3 
When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry , show life that you have a thousand reasons to smile . <3 
People are unreasonable , illogical , and self-centered . Love them anyway . If you do good , people may accuse you of selfish motives . Do good anyway . If you are successful , you may win false friends and true enemies . Succeed anyway . The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow . Do good anyway . What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight . Build anyway . <3 
Friendship is the source of the greatest pleasures & without friends , even the most agreeable pursuits become tedious . <3 
Kayaking just now was effing marvellous ! I'm loving water sports like to the maximum . Next up , banana boat or wake boarding . Anyone up for it ? Woo ! <3 
Every girl is beautiful if they have the ability to believe in themselves . <3 
School tomorrow . Abhorring the last minutes till school . Period . 
In < PROPFEMALE > tales , the princesses kiss the frogs & the frogs become princes . In real life , the princesses kiss the princes & the princes turns into frogs . Catch my drift ? Lol . 
Down with diarrhea today , meaning replacement in clinical area . Go away pretty please . Huhuhu . 
Stop & appreciate what you have today . Look at what you have with wider eyes , maybe with more compassion & more gratitude for the things that you do have & not the things you don't have . <3 
I think the most beautiful people are the ones who went through the toughest situations in life but still manage to keep a smile on their face , especially if they have a bright personality to go along with that smile . <3 
Everyone is made up entirely of flaws and imperfections , combined together with beautiful intentions . <3 
Don’t ever let anyone try and bring you down , because those who try are the ones who have so much bitterness and hatred with themselves , so they bring others down with them . <3 
You come to love not by finding the perfect person , but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly . <3 
Anyone have like the slightest idea what to study for pharmaco test tmrw ? I'm totally lost in my own world , doing case study . Hurhur . 
A true friend is someone who understands your past , believes in your future , and accepts you today just the way you are . <3 
I watched this drama on teevee about how God despises children who don't practise filial piety towards their parents . They get their retribution during their death . The way they die is so grotesque & horrifying . I wanna be a filial daughter . I don't wanna hurt my parents ' heart or make them cry . I love mommy & daddy . <3 
On days when you beat yourself up over any regrets , always remember that life isn’t about all the mistakes you make , it’s about what you learn while you’re picking yourself back up from them . <3 
O Allah , enlighten what is dark in me , strengthen what is weak in me , mend what is broken in me , bind what is bruised in me , heal what is sick in me , straighten what is crooked in me & revive whatever peace & love that has died in me . Ameen . <3 
For me , true love is when you love someone for the sake of Allah , you help each other here in the Dunia cuz you want to meet again in Jannah . Masyaallah . <3 
Friendship doubles your joys & divides your sorrows . <3 
My mother , she is beautiful , softened at the edges and tempered with a spine of steel . I want to grow old and be like her . Thanks a million Allah S.W.T for granting mama < PROPFEMALE > to me & to you mama , keep rrrrrocking ! xxx <3 
For me , Beauty shouldn't be judged from a pretty face , but from a pretty mind , a pretty heart & a pretty soul . <3 
When Allah loves you , He makes you endure trials . So face those trials with a smile , cuz deep down you know He loves you . <3 
I SWEAR THE MOST IRRITATING/ANNOYING/EXASPERATING/BELEAGUERING THING THAT'S EVER INVENTED FOR HOSPITALS IS THE UROSHEATH . The damn sticky tape can seriously annoy the hell outta me , especially when it gets stuck to the gloves . Pfft . 
ZOMG yesterday plus today was just awesome . Met the most amazing people , albeit random . Sometimes you just don't know what's in store for you in life . Thanks for being such angels cuz I really enjoyed myself helluva . Lesson learnt : Don't judge a book by its cover , judge by its contents . Woo ! <3 
Life is too ironic to fully comprehend . It takes Sadness to know what Euphoria is , Noise to appreciate Silence & Absence to value Presence . <3 
Don't try & perfect yourself for one person . Wait for the one who loves your imperfections & accept you just the way you are . <3 
Joke/Quote of the day from one of my girlfies : \Behind every girl is a dumbass guy who did her wrong & made her strong . Douchebag . \ " Lol . " 
Laugh your heart out , dance in the rain , < PROPFEMALE > the moments & ignore the pain . Live , laugh , love , forgive & forget . Life's too short to be living with regrets . <3 
Girls do not dress for boys . They dress for themselves & of course , each other . If girls dressed for boys , they'd just walk around naked at all times . Catch my drift ? Lol . 
ZOMG I was so gobsmacked when my mum gave me the green light to be an air stewardess just now when I don't even have real intentions to be one . Come on mummy , I don't even have what it takes to be one okay ? Lol . 
It's not about being who someone else wants you to be . It’s about being completely yourself & finding someone who loves inch & every bit of it . Someone who loves your laugh & your smile & the sound of your voice & the things you say . Someone who loves you even when you’re in a bad mood or when your face is red and puffy with tears . <3 
Frankly speaking , I used to have this perception that if someone hated you , they'd just delete you on FB . Apparently not at all . They use your feeds to bitch about you . The best part of this ? I'm still trying to decipher the irony of this fact is . Welcome to the real world baby ! 
Tell me whether I should be flattered or angry for the following convo between me & my patient just now . \ 
Patient : Eh you Singaporean uh ? You look like foreigner . Are you from Philippines or smth ? \ 
Patient's relative : Yeah you look like foreigner . You look Eurasian . Can I call you < PROPFEMALE > ? < PROPFEMALE > is a pretty name . \ 
LOL EPIC ! 
I've come to realize that you can't depend on other people to get what you want . You gotta gather up your nerve , throw yourself out there & get what you < PROPFEMALE > . You gotta dream big & run after your goals , cuz no one is gonna run the baton for you . How's that for a perfect recipe to tackle PRCP ? <3 
I doubt anyone will ever comprehend how much I abominate working life , I swear . Deprived me most of my freedom & what's worst , suppresses my immune system cuz of lack of rest . Sheesh how I wish I can be a schoolgirl all my life . Boohoo ! 
I've learnt that in life , people simply come & go , but you learn to know that , the people who stay are the ones who will always be there , through all the bullshit , drama , through thick & thin . They will always have your back & you realize those are the only people that you truly need . <3 
Life is already complicated as it is . You don’t need people to weigh you down , people to disappoint you . Woo . <3 
Working life stinks ! Now I can't even differentiate a weekday & a weekend . When was the last time I even had a proper date/girlfriend's day out/random rendezvous with my beloved ones ? Very poor . 
Let me tell you smth you already know . The world ain’t all sunshine & rainbows . It is a very mean & nasty place & it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it . You , me , or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life . But it ain’t how hard you hit ; it’s about how hard you can get hit , and keep moving forward . How much you can take , and keep moving forward . That’s how winning is done . <3 
Can I count on you if I fall apart ? 
Some days just stinks , other days are just plain awful . You know what you hafta do when those days come ? You shake it off , forgive , forget & move on . Otherwise you’ll spend a long time wallowing in the negatives . <3 
Diagnosis : Otitis Media . Treatment Plan : Encourage patient to sneeze with mouth open . Zomg how the hell is that even possible ? Tell you what , if you can even find me someone who has that kind of ability , I'll give you ten buckeroos . Lol . 
Trust me , there is no person in the world who is made to handle every punch that’s thrown at them . We aren’t made that way . In fact , we’re bound to feel mad , upset , sad , be hurt , stumble and fall . We aren’t supposed to be able to handle everything . But on a lighter note , that’s what makes us stronger in the end , by learning from the things that hurt us most . <3 
I've discovered as I’ve grown up that life is far more complicated than you think when you’re a kid . It isn’t just a straight forward < PROPFEMALE > tale . It's more than what meets the eye . You gotta experience it to know how to deal with things . Enough said . <3 
Prettiness is only skin deep , but real beauty comes from within . <3 
Braids , frozen yogurt , pandas , dolphins , a good book , daydream , florals , gummies , love letters , polaroid pictures , picnics , sunshine , rain , lace , carousels , endless conversations , vintage , trench coats , long busrides , eyeliner , candycanes , music & lyrics , trust , people , ice cream , travel , far away , hair accessories , french , jellybeans , macaroons , text messages , a kiss on the forehead : ME . <3 
When you’re a little girl , you believe in fairytales . Then you say you're going to find < PROPMALE > Charming . In fairytales , the bad guy is easy to spot . He’s always wearing a black cape . Then you grow up . You find out that < PROPMALE > Charming isn’t as easy to find as you thought it was . The bad guy , isn’t wearing a black cape . He’s really cute and he makes you laugh , but in the end , breaks your heart slowly but surely . 
Life is too short to spend it with people who annoys the living daylights outta you . <3 
Treat people as you would like to be treated . < PROPFEMALE>'s only a bitch if you are , period . <3 
When you’re young all heartbreaks feels like the end of the world . But it’s not ; it’s just the beginning . You might have to meet a few more jerks , but one day you’re gonna meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated like the sun rises and sets with you . <3 
We're not perfect . Any of us . We make mistakes , we screw up , but then we forgive and we move forward . If I can , you should too . Cheerios ! <3 
I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates , or love at first sight . But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life , if you were lucky , you might meet someone who was exactly right for you . Not cuz he was perfect , or cuz you were , but cuz your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together . <3 
Oh , here's a condom for you . I figured since you're acting like a < PROPMALE > , you should start dressing like one too . In your face douchebag . <3 
If someone breaks your heart , break their face , simple . <3 
Mommy can I have an angmoh as a boyfriend ? A halal one at that pretty pleeeeease . * gives the puppy eye look * 
If you don't have anything nice to say , then do us all a gargantuan favour & just keep your mouth shut . Thanks a million . 
Yay yay ! Hari ni malam raya , besok hari raya , malam nanti makan sama . It rhymes ! Lol . 
Question : What do you think about me ? \ 
\ 
Well , it's Christmas < PROPFEMALE > & I'm hell bored , so you can't blame me for posting nonsensical questions cuz I thrive in nonsense . Nonsense wakes up my brain cells . <3 
They say nothing lasts forever ; dreams change , trends come & go , but friendships never go out of style . <3 
If you're gonna be two-faced , at least make one of them pretty , thanks a million . Lol . 
If you want the rainbow , you've gotta put up with the rain . Simple . <3 
Ahhh today & tmrw will be doing night shift . Nvm I'll text < PROPFEMALE > to come party with me & my patients . Give him oreo cookies & choco milk . Who wanna come ? Hehe . 
They say the key to life is euphoria . They say the key to euphoria is self love . Loving yourself might take awhile , from imperfection to imperfection . You’re not perfect , darling , I’ll tell you that . But I’ll tell you something else - you’re beautiful . <3 
Along the way , I’ve learned that you can’t let anyone in too far and you can’t trust endlessly . The biggest mistake you can make is to care or love someone more than yourself , because then you are just setting yourself up for disappointment . Boundaries are necessary so that you can protect yourself , because once you’re broken , you’ll never be fully fixed . <3 
Just woke up from my beauty sleep . Night shift , here I come again . May you be as blissful & as serene as yesterday . Oh I've got a date with < PROPFIRST > Brown again don't I baby ? See you in 4 hours ' time , absolutely looking forward . Yum ! <3 
Note to self : Don't place your euphoria in someone else's hands , cuz once they're gone , so is your euphoria . Remember that ultimately , you yourself have the ability to make yourself smile like there's no tomorrow . <3 
Don't cry for a guy , let a guy cry for you , cuz girls give & forgive but guys get & forget . Don't waste your precious tears lovely ladies . <3 
I SURVIVED TWO NIGHT SHIFTS ! WOOHOO IMMA SURVIVOR ! <3 
If a girl looks swell when she meets you , who gives a damn if she is late ? Nobody . Exactly . 
I <3 12B . Enough said . 
Why must the good looking guys predominantly be either gay , married or taken ? I want my fair share too , but added with personality . Boohoo . 
Don’t love when it’s only convenient for you . Just cuz love doesn’t want you now , doesn’t mean the right guy isn’t out there looking for you . <3 
We all remember the fairytales of our childhoods . The shoe fits < PROPFEMALE > , the frog turns into a < PROPMALE > , etc . Problem is , fairytales don’t come true . It’s the other stories , the ones that begin with dark & < PROPFEMALE > nights & end in the unspeakable . It’s the nightmares that always seem to become reality . The person who invented the phrase “Happily ever after” should have his ass kicked , so hard . <3 
Money can't buy love , that's why people steal hearts . <3 
Never stay with someone who doesn't show you that you deserve the universe . Don't do anyone any favours when all they do is make you sacrifice . You deserve more than you give yourself credit for . Knw that you shld never settle for someone who can't prove their words for you . Most of all , LOVE YOURSELF & everything well will follow suit . <3 
Frankly speaking , I've always believed that New Year wishes are just bullshits . I just wanna be as pious to God as possible cuz I knw everyth good will follow suit if I'm a good Muslim . I don't hafta wish on a wishing < PROPFEMALE > . God will give me miracles . <3 
Dear 2010 , thanks a million for teaching me invaluable lessons throughout the 12 months . You have taught me how to be strong in the midst of predicaments , how to choose my friends wisely , to always follow my heart & not my head , but most imperatively , you taught me to love myself more than ever . Goodbye . <3 
Note to self : Never get too attached to anyone cuz attachment leads to expectations & expectations leads to disappointments . It's mandatory & imperative to love myself more than ever before loving anyone else . <3 
In life , you don't get the people that you want . You get the people you need ; to teach you , to hurt you , to love you , to make you laugh & best of all , to make you exactly the person you should be . <3 
Zomg she's so fake I swear if you flip her hair & take a closer look at the back of the neck , I bet you can see MADE IN < PROPFEMALE > engraved there . Lol . 
Sometimes , we take for granted the people in our lives that mean so much & when we finally realize that , it can be too late . Take advantage of every minute you have , hold onto & < PROPFEMALE > every second . Have no regrets & never forget those that made you who you are . <3 
In a world filled with abomination , we must still dare to hope . In a world filled with angst , we must still dare to comfort . In a world filled with despair , we must still dare to dream . And in a world filled with distrust , we must still dare to believe . <3 
Never lie , steal , cheat , or drink . But if you must lie , lie in the arms of the one you love . If you must steal , steal away from bad company . If you must cheat , cheat death . And if you must drink , drink in the moments that take your breath away . <3 
Harta & rupa tak akan bawa saya kemana-mana . Hanya iman & taqwa akan menolong kita di padang Masyar . Mesti seimbang dunia & akhirat , itu baru betul . That's the kind of guy I want in a soulmate . No more , no less . <3 
Whatever happened to chivalry ? Does it only exist in 80’s movies ? I want < PROPFIRST > Cusack holding a boom box outside my window . I wanna ride off on a lawnmower with < PROPFIRST > Dempsey . I want < PROPMALE > from Sixteen Candles waiting outside the church for me . I want Judd < PROPMALE > thrusting his fist into the air because he knows he got me . Just once I want my life to be like an 80’s movie . <3 
If love & beauty were easy to find , they would not exist . Chaos & sadness exist in order for you to find the love and beauty in them . So that love & beauty mean smth . It’s meant to be hard to search . So that you will learn to appreciate better . <3 
I no longer believed in the idea of soulmates , or love at first sight . But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life , if you were lucky , you might meet someone who was exactly right for you . Not because he was perfect , or because you were , but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together . <3 
The problem now boy , is that deep in your soul , you're a living jerk , believe it or not . I'm sorry but I've been blinded by all that thick mask . In actual fact I pity you cuz God gave you a brain BIG enough for you to make use of , but instead you use your balls to think . Lol . 
Whatever you give a woman , she will make greater . If you give her sperm , she’ll give you a baby . If you give her a house , she’ll give you a home . If you give her groceries , she’ll give you a meal . If you give her a smile , she’ll give you her heart . She multiplies & enlarges what is given to her . So , if you give her any crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit . <3 
Infect with laughters , not STDs . <3 
Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before finding the right one , so that when we finally find the right one , we will know how to be grateful & appreciate the other person more than ever . <3 
Dear fellow girls : Guys ain't gonna run to your house at 3AM with flowers . They ain't always gonna randomly text you to tell how gorgeous you are . They probably ain't gonna dance & sing in the rain with you . Yes , they cheat & lie , some of them . But so do girls . Stop setting these high expectations & live in the real . Get over the fact that guys aren't perfect & neither are you . ? 
Roses are red , violets are blue , I have five fingers & the middle one's for you . <3 
I wanna be someone's < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . Who wanna be my < PROPFIRST > Brand ? Tetapi mesti seimbang dunia & akhirat tau . Then I want . If not can go cermin muka tu dulu okay ? Haha . 
Goodness gracious me , how on Earth can my five off days just surpass like that in a flurry . I'm only half satisfied . Me want more vacation pretty please ! Work in like less than two hours , gosh depressing . Hopefully my angels at work are there to cheer me up like a doll . Shiyonce Knowles Eiqa Rahman Shazni Nadzirah Sheilamos Mahmood <3 
Maybe I think you’re cute & hilarious , maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you , if you know what I mean . <3 
Don't ever let anyone try & bring you down , cuz those who try are the ones who have so much bitterness & hatred in themselves , so they bring others down with them . <3 
I'm thinking balls are to men what purses are to women . It's just a little bag , but we feel naked in public without it . Lol . 
Each women should be treated like a < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Sometimes second chances work out even better than the first cuz you learn from your mistakes . <3 
Rabbani Anuar , I swear the doctor will come back for the dark choco . Don't take eventho if it's still there on Mon or else the doctor will haunt you in your dreams ! Hahahaha . 
I could be your punkrock < PROPFEMALE > , and you could be my garage band < PROPMALE > . <3 
Note for all my beloved PRCP mates : Finish every day & be done with it . You have done your utmost best ; some blunders & absurdities no doubt crept in ; forget them as soon as you can . Tmrw is a hell of a new day , you shall begin it as serenely a possible & with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense . Let's overcome the odds together ! <3 
I have mixed feelings regarding my OT posting tmrw . Totally have no idea what lies behind the closed OT doors . Hope all's well . Gonna miss my lovelies over at 12B . Work hard , play harder lovelies . See you in a months ' time . Miss me when I'm gone . Heh . <3 
Sometimes in life there really are bonds formed that can never be broken . Sometimes you really can find that one person who will stand by you no matter what . Maybe you’ll find it in a spouse , but there’s also the < PROPMALE > that the one person you can count on for a lifetime , the one person who knows you sometimes better than you know yourself is the same person who’s been standing beside you all along . <3 
Dear two-faced person , I can't seem to decide which face of yours to punch first . 
In life , we do things . Some we wish we had never done & some we wish we could replay a million times in our heads . Nevertheless , they make us who we are & in the end , they shape every detail about us . If we were to reverse any of them , we wouldn’t be at the exact place that we are today . So just live , make mistakes & learn from them , and never second guess who you are , where you have been & where you are going . <3 
Everyone has the right to be stupid , but you are abusing the privilege . Lol . 
Jowin Sin MinLee Loh Sharvena Ubi < PROPFEMALE > Adoré Leong Lau < PROPFEMALE > Kang < PROPFEMALE > Sus & all the rest of the attachy mates for OT currently , I <3 you guys heaps . Let's go through thick & thin together . Yes , we made history cuz we're the kewl kids like that yo . :DDDDD 
I'm sick & tired of your shit . Go & have your period in the shark tank bitch . <3 
Have you ever heard a song from so long ago with so many memories tied to it that it made you cry ? And didn’t you wish that you could go back in time when everything was simpler & carefree ? Those are the songs that are the soundtracks of our lives . The ones that bring back our childhood , best friends , first love , first broken heart & the poignant memories . <3 
Men always wanna be a woman’s first love . That is their clumsy vanity . We women have a more subtle instinct about things . What we like is to be a man’s last romance . <3 
My perfect de-stress method ? Lying on the bed wrapped in my comfy comforter with the headphones blasting either oldies/ indie rock soundtracks . Woo better than awesome . It's pure bliss I swear . <3 
Mummy can you sponsor me 110 buckeroos pretty please cuz I'm currently broke as hell & am really looking forward to be part of the crowd for Laneway Festival . I'll promise I'll do the laundry & scrub the floor shiny clean in exchange for a rendezvous with my beloved Temper Trap & Ladyhawke . * gives puss in boots look * 
I swear I feel like a stranger in the midst of the OT staffs . Goodness gracious , weren't you guys like once a student before ? Show us students some love pretty please , dang ! 
I know I've made like heaps of mistakes , but I don't regret making any of them . Cuz if I hadn't made them , I wouldn't have learned the trick to make things right . <3 
You were born an original , don't die a copy . <3 
I wanna be your rock & roll < PROPFEMALE > . Go on a roadtrip around Europe in our VW < PROPFIRST > & yes , you can be the driver . We'll have heaps of pepperoni pizzas & strawberries dipped in chocolate . We can sleep in our trench coats , aviators & oversized oxfords . Maybe play in the rain with our raincoats & boots . Mhmm perfect gateway . <3 
Love is not about finding the right person , but creating a right relationship . It ain't about how much love you have in the beginning , but how much love you build till the end . <3 
Shiyonce Knowles Nue Misnawi Eiqa Nanahara ZOMG I totally know what the hell that thing you guys asked me to google already . Perverted minds ! Hahahaha . Now Nunu your turn to report your findings . * do the epic cooking dance thingy * <3 
Hafiz Kamarrudin Muhammad Fareed Fee Losophy I had a blast with you guys , you guys were awesome people . Let's chill again pretty soooon . I wanna see Fee get forfeited . It's always me & Fareed . Boohoo . ): 
Imperfection is beauty , madness is genius & it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring . <3 
Confession : I used to stereotype westsiders being very typical mats & minahs . Now that I've met several awesome mates from the west , I gotta admit that forging bonds with them is one of the best damn thing that's ever transpired in my entire life . Woo ! <3 
LONDON IS DEFINITELY THE EPITOME OF GRANDIOSE ! Hell yeah sponsor me buckeroos for a vacation there pretty pleaaaaase . * gives puss in boots look * 
YOU DON’T HAFTA ASK ME “WHAT'S UP” EVERY SINGLE TIME I SIGN ON MSN/FB , CUZ IT WAS ALWAYS THE CEILING & UNTIL MY HOUSE GETS BOMBED IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CEILING . Period . 
When life gets tough , just put one foot in front of the other & keep going . Can't do that ? Well then get in a wheelchair . 
I have a confession to make : I love British accent , it makes me go wowzers . Like the woohoo woohoo kind of feeling , you get me ? I wanna send my kids to a British montessori & make them speak in British accent . Confirm sexybompeepee ! Woo ! <3 
I don’t wanna be hot or pretty . I don’t wanna turn heads when I walk on the street . What I would really like , is to be someone’s kind of beautiful . Just one person , who will still think I’m beautiful even when I’m old & the world despises me . <3 
Fashion is the most powerful < PROPMALE > there is . It's movement , design & architecture all in one . It shows the world who we are & who we'd like to be . <3 
Sometimes God doesn't give you what you think you want . Not cuz you don't deserve it , but He thinks that you deserve more . So don't go all emo & claim that God doesn't love you when you don't get what you want , cuz believe me He sure as hell love you in ways beyond imagination . <3 
When life gives you a bad romance , show everyone your poker face , buy a new telephone , call < PROPMALE > & you guys can just dance all night long . <3 
No men . No pain . Know men . Know pain . <3 
Love does not revolve solely on chemistry or is it sparked by one . True love happens when both souls are able to overlook each other's differences & work things out from there , by building chemistry . Enough said . <3 
Euphoria keeps you sweet , sorrows keep you human , life keeps you humble , success keeps you glowing , but only God keeps you going . <3 
Hell yeah I'm starting to dig my fellow Dinamis mates . Let's make this an effing HUGE success alrighty mighty . We rrrrrock ! <3 
Spend life with who makes you happy , not with who you hafta impress . <3 
Do me a favour & don't sugar-coat anything . I wanna hear your truth , no matter how raw & blunt it is . I wanna hear your thoughts , uncensored & un-edited . <3 
Politics is showbiz for ugly people you catch my drift ? 
If you < PROPFEMALE > Allah S.W.T to be persistent in granting you the things that you love , be persistent in doing things that he love . Fair enough . <3 
You can simply photoshop your face , but you can never photoshop your attitude . Period . <3 
When you learn to accept instead of expect , you'll have fewer disappointments . You gotta trust me on this one , I swear . <3 
Morning everyone . Today is the 14th of February & it is just like any other day . May today we be blessed with heaps of Allah's blessings & love ! Cuz you know yourself nth is better than His love . * winks * 
Don't let the past dictate who you are , but let it be part of who you will become . ? 
If there's an award for being very broke , I think I'll bag the first prize cuz I'm sure as hell feeling friggin broke now . Now then I wanna be a billionaire so freaking baaaad ! ))))): 
People say that your dreams are the only things that save you . Come on baby in our dreams , we can live on misbehavior .? <3 
Our parents are the most precious blessing that we can ever receive . For those whose parents are unwell , may Allah bless them with good health & wealth . Amin . <3 
Do you know the feeling that you get when you have two RDs in the middle of the week like on a Thurs & Fri for an instance & you still have to work on weekends , but realized that you're still stuck on the same week , not on a brand new week ? Sucks balls < PROPMALE > time . This should be one of the FML moments of a PRCP kiddo . ): 
Don’t hold onto anger , hurt or pain . They steal your energy and keep you from love . <3 
Life is like Facebook . People will like your problems & comment , but no one will help solve them cuz everyone is busy updating theirs . Mhmm . 
Emma : You make my heart have premature ventricular contractions . \ 
Adam : What ? \ 
Emma : You make my heart skip a beat . \ 
Awh shucks so saccharine ! <3 
The sign of maturity is not when we start speaking big things , but actually when you start understanding small things . <3 
People who don't have problems don't really live . Everybody gets problems & must fight for it . <3 
Girls who have a strong belief system are beautiful in an extraordinary way . Believe . Me . 
Nobody looks good in their darkest most grim hours . However it's those hours that makes us what we are today . <3 
Don't waste your time looking back on what you've lost . Move on , life is not meant to be traveled backwards ! <3 
Without God , our week is : Mournday , Tearsday , Wasteday , Thirstday , Fightday , Shatterday and Sinday . <3 
Allah SWT does not look at your face or body , rather He looks at your heart . <3 
Euphoria keeps you sweet . Trials keep you strong . Sorrows keep you human . Failures keep you humble . GOD , keeps you going ! <3 
11th March 2011 = F . R . E . E . D . O . M <3 
I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U has eight letters , but baby , so does B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T <3 
It's Better To Lose A Lover Than To Love A Loser ! <3 
Every woman is a mystery to be solved <3 
Sometimes God allows some things to be torn down in your life so they can be built the right way <3 
Shall start the countdown from today officially : 3 more days for TTSH kids as far as I'm concerned c'mon you go boys & girls we can do it cuz we've been through 3 friggin months ! Three days are peanuts heh <3

Zomgah I noticed that you're only a bitch on days that end with a Y . 
Newsflash bitch , I don't live to please you , period . 
Life is incredible when you decide you love yourself enough to weed out all the bullshit that don't belong . Self love is the ultimate love above all <3 
What matters is not your ability to steal a lot of hearts , but your ability to keep only one heart . <3 
Hold hands , not grudges . Break dance , not hearts . Do hugs , not drugs . Be happy , not easy <3 
In your bed , it's 6AM , you close your eyes for 5 minutes , it's 7:45 . At school , it's 1:30 , you close your eyes for 5 minutes , it's STILL 1:30 . ( Prolly this is one of the reasons I miss school , time flies so friggin slow except when you're on break or fooling around with your friends , meh ! ) 
Wahai lelaki-lelaki sekalian , if you wanna go Friday Prayers no need to check in through Foursquare & announce to the whole world what . Wanna < PROPFEMALE > pahala must discreetly , cannot action , later minus off your blessings points da rugi lol . 
ERP collections should be donated to Japan , LIKE TOTALLY ! 
Saya sayang bangeeeet sama semua crew Dinamis saya , nanti dekat Loft semua bobok sama saya okeydoke ? Hehehe <3 
Don't dare deny the mere fact that Dinamis bonds us closer cuz I feel that I'm bonded to some people in ways that are unimaginable , syukur alhamdulillah love you girlies to the maximum !? 
If I took a punch to the face for everything wrong with you , I'd be in a coma . 
Looking through all the photos taken at school since Year One made me feel hell nostalgic & realised a truth so intangible : I definitely , absolutely miss being a student & going to school . < PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
Your name , is ucking Stupid . The missing letter is the grade you got on your common sense exam . 
People always complain about how life is too short . Liiiiiiiiife . Okeydoke problem solved . 
When people try to break you , don’t let them . The trick to winning isn’t winning , to fight , or to pretend like it doesn’t affect you . You just don’t let them break you , that’s when you won the battle for yourself <3 
Middle finger is used when words aren't enough for people to comprehend that they're helluva annoying , that's the reason why the phrase \action speaks louder than words\ " is created in the first place . " 
Real men never stop trying to show a girl how much she means to him , even after he's got her <3 
Ladies , sometimes your knight in shining armor is just a retard in tin foil . 
Prove to me you’re not average & we’ll be on the same < PROPFEMALE > ; cause the only difference I see in guys is they all got different names . 
Some girls need to control their WHOREmones . 
When life's a bitch , you gotta learn how to pimp it <3 
Dinamis Seni < PROPFIRST > Baba Blah Blah Blah 2011's experience , the best I've ever had . To all the casts , congratulations for rocking the stage cuz we sure as hell blew them audience away cuz we're awesome like that . We ROCK babies , we did it despite all the predicaments , alhamdulillah ! Gonna miss all of you like crazy , helluva crazy <3 
Seni warisan adalah perjuangan . Bukannya alat untuk diperdagangkan . < PROPFEMALE > anak warisan zaman . Memperjuangkan apa < PROPFEMALE > ditinggalkan <3<3<3 
Awh shucks is it just me or whenever I watched the videos from Dinamis , they never fail make me to have goosebumps all over my body , < PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
When all is said & done , you’re a part of me , that’s the way it was meant to be , people are brought together for a reason , everything happens for a reason , I believe the reason you & me were brought together was cuz we complete each other , we fill in each others missing spaces , the empty holes , the blind spots , with love . For all my Dinamis sweethearts <3 
It's pretty hilarious that Facebook is now like overwhelmed with snapshots from < PROPFIRST > Baba Blah Blah Blah , it's like we're basking in the limelight & conquering people's news feed . Like coolio aglio olio only , goodness ! <3 
If Dinamis is a sort of World War , Redondo would be our staple food , thanks to momsy for introducing Redondo to our MCC family cuz due to us I guess their sales just skyrocketed for no apparent reason lol . 
Being single doesn't necessarily mean you're available . Sometimes you have to put up a sign that says , \Do Not Disturb\ " on your heart <3 " 
Ladies it's perfectly alright to be single . The right man at the right time will step up to the plate . Love yourself more ! You're beautiful exactly as you are & it's your imperfections that make you perfect . Remember that ! <3 
Oh screw beautiful , I’m brilliant . If you wanna appease me , compliment my brain <3 
? Single ? Taken ? God is busy writing the best love story for me <3 
Don't wait for problems to come to seek God . Seek God before problems come to you <3 
That awkward moment when you can't tell if someone is a male or a female . zzz 
Love me for my brawns & personality , ain't my beauty cuz beauty is ephemeral whereas brawns & personality is forever <3 
Girls wish to be loved not because they are pretty , sexy , or good , but cuz they are themselves <3 
Remember when someone annoys the crap outta you , it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown , but it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm & bitchslap that mothereffer . Lol . 
Some men have many women & love none . A real man has one woman & loves her as if there existed none . Food for thought <3 
Duct tape ; Finding a cure to noise pollution , one mouth at a time <3 
That awkward moment when someone asks you what's wrong & they are the problem . 
Oh Allah SWT , cleanse our hearts of the sicknesses of arrogance & pride and let us die as sincere , humble Muslims . Amin <3 
I'm not single & I'm not taken . I'm simply on reserve for the one who deserves my heart <3 
Sometimes you’re afraid to become a couple cuz you're afraid of losing what you already have with that person . But life is all about risks & it requires you to jump . Don’t be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have , or could have had . No one waits forever <3 
Being with all women in this world doesn't make you a man , but making one woman feel like she's the world .. that does ! <3 
Every women deserves a man who looks at her every day like it's the first time he saw her <3
