It's rather hard to find out something ye don't know . 
Knowledge is a valuable thing . In voicing a thought we define a series of ideas , stringing them together in a structure we call language . It allows for the communication of thought . Such an ability is a powerful one . It allows one to place their thoughts in the minds of others , allowing knowledge to spread , treasure to be stored in the minds of others , seeds planted in fertile ground to grow in their own unique ways . 
In essence of the value of knowledge and the power of language to convey it , one can recognize the far greater magnitude of significance we have in the power of writing . Even any seemingly unimportant or common mundane knowledge or trivia is valuable . Simple journals and letters from even a hundred years ago give us insight into the life and culture of what was then society ; it gives us insight into another world .
