Don't just live in a desert place . Cultivate your land . Cultivate a relationship with God . Cultivate a love of His words . Cultivate ! 
and it doesn't stop there ! Cultivate your people relationships-start within your family . Cultivate a love of learning . Cultivate your life ! 
But remember , we don't go to a fast food window for cultivating . Care for the soil to allow the plants TIME to grow . Cultivating takes Time !
