is amazed it took her so long to join this site . 

If the different fields of science contradict one another , is science doomed to fall as it is an example of the dualism which inevitably destroys everything it touches ? Or something else ? 
you know , that quiz is eerily incorrect . . . and also eerily correct . 
Please , God , save me from my everlasting boredom or my kitchen will be a pile of ashes in 4 seconds ! 
< PROPMALE > and Hobbes : < PROPMALE > : It's not denial . I'm just very selective about the reality I accept . t.t I wish I exercised this latent human ability more often . 
< PROPFEMALE > ( my little sister who's pestering me ): If reality is false , and everything false is NOT reality , then what is it I ask you ? The answer , of course , is TORTELLINI !

is having difficulty with the knowledge that , apparently , she is < PROPMALE > Alexandrovitch Millerman's number one fan ( read : STALKER ) . . . and that she seems to be the only one not laughing her head off about it .

will miss being able to watch < PROPFIRST > Leno live , despite her joy at his return to his superior show and time slot . . . Goodbye Frog Man ! < :D 
< PROPFEMALE > - UrbanDictionary : A super-sweet girl . Extremely gorgeous and tons of fun . When you meet one you will want to be a huge part of her life but you would have to be very lucky for it to happen . An < PROPFEMALE > will stay on your mind forever so you will know when you meet one . 
There's a reason we're called the right . It's because it is right . 
You remind me of the babe ! What babe ? The babe with the power ! What power ? The power of voodoo ! Who do ? You do ! Do what ? REMIND ME OF THE BABE !!! . . . . I love Labryinth :D 
shall not join another game on Facebook because they are slowly and painfully consuming her soul . 
will not be on Facebook for awhile to focus on the rest of life . She will entrust her profile to her younger sister , who has promised to change the password and not tell it to her until she is prepared to return . She humbly asks your help by contacting her by phone or email until her return , and thanks you for your support in her endeavor to be more awesome . :D < PROPFEMALE > ne , minnasan !

is amazed that emailing multiple people to ask about homework missed on two sick days doesn't seem to work anymore . I mean , yeesh , guys , how hard is it to give a sick friend homework ? It takes like 5 minutes , tops ! * cough * < :(

First all-nighter ever . . . I'm gonna pass out in the middle of < PROPMALE > . . . grahk .

School : DO NOT WANT . 
loves Gargoyles - and Futurama - and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s voice . That is all . * squee *
