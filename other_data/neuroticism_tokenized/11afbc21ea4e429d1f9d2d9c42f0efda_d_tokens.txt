you've got a friend in me . 
so , just watched toy story 2 ( again ) . And Woody's Round Up ( the fictional tv show ) was cancelled in 1995 according to the Proctor . What bothers me is that 1 ) it's in black and white , and 2 ) The Proctor claims that it was cancelled because of the launch of Sputnik ... Sputnik was launched 38 years prior , in 1957 ... mind agitated .

needs a fan to < PROPFEMALE > around with him in school . 
to be honest , money doesn't matter , material items won't make you happy . It is the friends of which you make and spend time with and the impact you make on others ' lives that truly make you happy , no matter how simple or involved , making an impression on someone's life is amazing . 
just wishes time would fly .
