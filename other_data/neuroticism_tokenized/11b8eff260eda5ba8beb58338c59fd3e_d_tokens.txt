What were the three questions we had to do for our speech reflection ? Anyone ? x.x 
Grr . . . you know how I have no picture ? Well , I just tried to upload one , and it said : ' NO!' , and slapped me ! Okay , so maybe that's not exactly what happened . . . but it won't let me . x.x 
Is there school on Friday ? *( < PROPFEMALE > wants to know . ) 
Yeah , you know you want that LTM tomorrow . xD 
Hey , for Meadow's test , I have no idea what the bodies of water that we're supposed to know are . Supposedly there's a link on edline ? I think it's hiding from me . 
I just got contacts . :O 
Turned in the Gatsby resource file , only the lab report and the personal project essay to go . xD 
Wewt , only 1,200 words to go til my statement is done ! 
I feel so accomplished now . :3 
Wow , I still haven't even bothered putting up a picture . Lmao . xD 
Has anyone here completed their yoga thing ? \ 
Because I just got the e-mail , but never got anything in the mail . And it's due today . D: 
< PROPMALE > Club tomorrow . More people should show up , we'll be making senior crowns . \ 
Note : this is not for those that cannot handle crafts . May cause blindness if done incorrectly . 
Who knows where I can get a CAS Log Sheet ? \ 
Also , on a random note : Photoshoot this week . :D ( Fire and Air ) 
WOOT . Photoshoot tomorrow ! Should be awesome . \ 
Maybe I'll even get a facebook pic out of it . 
<3 <3 <3 PB & J necklaces finally on sale during lunch . Look for the < PROPMALE > Club < PROPFIRST>'s Day poster or buy from me , < PROPFIRST > , or < PROPFEMALE > . They look freaking AWESOME ! 
< PROPMALE > Show this Thursday ! I think everyone should come . Everyone . \ 
Except the stupid people that come in , eat , and leave . They're not welcome . 
< PROPMALE > show tomorrow ! I hope everyone plans on coming . :) 
I'd say the < PROPMALE > show today was pretty fun , no ? \ 
I think Sulian enjoyed it too much , though . 
So apparently keyboards can be as germ-filled at toilet seats if they're not cleaned enough . Lovely . 
LMAO . \It's complicated\ " is a relationship status ? What's that even supposed to mean ? " 
\The vocab cards will only take you about an hour . \ " - Mr. Morone ... Has anyone actually managed that ? It took me a little longer than an hour . " 
Guess who left the first half of his bio work in a notebook for safekeeping and then left said notebook at his aunt's house . Yup . 
Did anyone pick PET #1 ? If so , what did McGreevy or Morone tell you , because McGreevy never got to everyone doing that PET in our class .
