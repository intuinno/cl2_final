All of this comes crashing down , Cornerstone's gone Sleepless Hopeless . No end in sight . Ink well has run dry , fill it with blood of the scribe . Rest comes easy , to the guiltless The vampire laments , as he prays , for the sun . Doom , despair , tragedy are the tools of the trade .

' sigh ' okay heres the deal ... i'm the proud owner of a 1984 318i bmw and have been working on it for a while now ( still dont start ... dont know why ) but i love it !.... i was just recently offered a 19884 528e with no problems , runs just fine . im not a big fan of the 5-series , and the 318i has sentimental value ... what to do , what to do !? 
well i cant do the engine swap :-( looks like im just getting a new beemer 
next tuesday i buy the MAP sensor for it , pretty sure thats the last piece ( i mean it this time ) if it doesnt start ill prob just get the 5-series ; just not a fan of the look . as for the engine swap , the engine tranny , and wiring harness are easy , the driveshaft wont work ( 5series is longer ) and im not sure the 318i's driveshaft can handle it , 
hey ya'll

2009-2010 < PROPMALE > Cup : Flyers vs . Blackhawks . This is going to be the gayest < PROPMALE > Cup in a while but IF I HAD TO CHOOSE . unfortunately id say Flyers , ONLY BECAUSE they really do deserve it , I think they've consecutively been to the Playoffs ( almost ) every year more than any other team in NHL History . and only won 2x so its more of a < PROPFEMALE > if they win .... Plus Chicago has Hossa , he can choke on a $%#* 
< PROPFIRST > Zesiger : \ 
My father used to say that not playing to win is like sleeping with your\ 
sister . Sure she's a great piece of tail , with a blouse full of \

thing . Kids with no teeth who do nothing but play the banjo ... eat apple\ 
sauce through a straw ... pork farm animals .

The myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten ( forgotten ) . \ 
Take hold of my hand , \ 
For you are no longer alone . \ 
Walk with me in hell .
