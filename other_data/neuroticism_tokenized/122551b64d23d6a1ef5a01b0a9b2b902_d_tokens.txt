What can I do ? This is eating disorder territory and I am out of my league . A psych eval suggestion wasn't warmly received . ???

24 hours awake and counting . Perhaps 30 is the new 20 . 
And remember , with Brown Paper Tickets , smiles are free ! 
Talley wasn't an A list player . He will likely never make the hall of fame , but this is the best explanation I've seen for the Bills ( and to a lesser extent , every losing team in any sport ) last decade . Also Sully of the Buffalo News is a better sports writer than the entire staff of the Times and PI combined . Truth . http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/columns/jerry-sullivan/article215812.ece 
Nice thing about the BPT Meydenbauer office is you can blast music in the back room and call center can't hear it in the front . 
Nasty Bills comment of the week ( regarding their Facebook < PROPFEMALE > referencing a ' highlight ' reel ) : The only highlight would be news of a murder/suicide that involved < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Buffalo . Time to Billieve in 0 and 16 . 
A French possesive could be ' tus ' right ? The intimate form of ' your' ? HELP ME INTERNETS ! 
Anyone down to eat at Joule in Wallingford ?

Everything I know about conflict resolution I learned from < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > cartoons . 
Does anyone have a live trap for rats and mice ? I'd rather play catch and release but death traps are cheaper . Oddly , I was just talking about how I never had a rodent problem tonight . Ask your hippy kids , because for a $2 kill trap it makes little sense to pay $30 for a live one . Granola is tasty but Kool Ade is not . 
Curious . How many of you have never shot a gun ? 
Never thought I'd say this , but I feel sorry for < PROPFIRST > fans . Romo is a decent guy . 
I have decided I'd rather deal with the blackouts than sobriety . Sometimes it's better to wonder than to know . - Overheard at the Griz 
Never had $50 a pound tea before . Good shit . #reallyfondofhavingAsianfriends 
Homemade lamb and onion dolmades . Fuck yeah . 6 hours of work seldom tastes so good . 
This sounds like a joke but isn't : get paid to work for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > going door to door . 10$ per hour . Let me know after 4 PM . I Can't get back to everyone andt 
Tommorrow ( today actually ) at the Grizzled Wizard at 1 PM football potluck . Ribs , brisket , pulled pork and my eggplant dip . Epic shits gonna drop . Bring shit or don't , we have plenty . 
QOTD \It\ 
If you haven't played Limbo and Super Meat Boy do so . 
I never want to see another phokeng ticket as long as I live . 
Way too many bad things have happened to way too many good people this week . 
I love it when people don't suck . 
I was just over shopping at Kohl's and the prices on glass tea light holders were ... well , I won't spoil the surprise for you , but they were pretty low . Isn't there someone in your life that could use a glass tea light holder ? 
Apparently the Brown Paper Tickets Bellevue version of the Seattle office's Lady Gaga dance off is the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > sing along . That and doing shit loads of math . 
Is it just me or is every single person in Seattle sick , getting sick or just getting done being sick ? 
Snow in Wallyhood . 
If anyone needs a place to stay in Wallingford I can provide uncomfortable accomodations . Blankets are in short supply but you can bury yourself in clothes I intended to take to Goodwill years ago . 
Does anyone happen to have a video of cars sliding on Capital Hill on , I don't know , say , 11/22/10 ? 
I said it's impassible , nothings impossible . Except for sometimes passing . 
Obligatory holiday posting ! 
You know , I've never really forgiven airplanes for September 11th . 
Right\ 
now I'm thankful for < PROPFIRST > Peterson and his girlfriend bringing a full 7 course meal to\ 
work for me just because they're awesome . I might add it's very fucking tasty . 
Gems from today's attempt to talk someone into setting up a ticket scanner system . She refers to CAT-5 cable as telephone wires . She thinks the color of CAT-5 cable matters . Her office has clicking links from an email disabled (?!?) so she asks if she can simply copy and paste a URL into the address bar and is surprised when that works . * headdesk * 
< PROPFEMALE > Newsom has a song in a Hewlett Packard commercial . Huh . 
New laptop . 2.2 gig dual core , 3 gigs ram , 280 gig SSHD for $400 . I have VLC , utorrent , ZoneAlarm , PeerBlock , Spybot , Security Essentials , Super AntiSpyware , HTTPS Everywhere , AdBlock Plus and Google Sharing . What else am I missing ? I think security-wise this bitch is Fort Knox , but I'm open to suggestions . 
Nothing matters , < PROPFIRST > , when you're free .

How do you keep a cougar out of your backyard ? Put up a goalpost ... 
I'm going to be in Portland next week from Wednesday to Friday for < PROPMALE > Cohen . Any suggestions other than spending all my time at The Magic Garden ? Dive bar suggestions are welcome , the divier the better , I like the kind of places where you're likely to pick up a staph infection . 
Anyone down for the Funhouse tonight ? Kylesa and Lesbian are playing at 9:30 . 12 bucks presale , probably the same at the door . 
\Satan worshipers are a covetous bunch \"" 
< PROPMALE > Roth is really really ill . Really ill . If you want to see him do it soon . He's at UW Medical Center if you would like to visit . 
\We don't take dimes . Dimes are garbage . We hate dimes\ " - The Tube " 
A strip club with a salad bar ? Cool ! 8.50 for a T-bone ? Fuck yeah . 
I sincerely regret visiting Portland just for shows and driving back the same night . < PROPFIRST > at the Grizzled Wizard had it right when he told me to treat it like Vegas . A cheap Vegas without people from flyover states on their first vacation from corn county AK . The Magic Gardens , The Tube , Pints , The A-crop , Voodoo Doughnut , and My Father's Place are landmarks of note . 
Never bet against a Sicilian when death is on the line . 
@ Jazz Alley for The Bad Plus . 
Need a cheap drunk ? Kill the Keg Night at the Grizzled Wizard !!!! Rolling Rock is $1 < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Celebration and Bridgeport IPA $2.75 ' till they're gone . We'll drop the price a quarter every hour after 10pm . 
Mad Men is a pretty good corporate psychodrama . It reminds me of BDXP where once I worked in corporate . It bears little resemblence to BPT . This is good . 
I am wearing holiday themed boxers today but only because they are clean and close enough to pick up with my toes so I didn't have to get out of bed . 
< PROPFEMALE > Burana customer that lives on Fortuna drive . That shit's < PROPFEMALE > . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas or pagan holiday of your choosing . 
Aaaaand the Dawgs kneel it out on the 4 for the mercy kill . We got talent and class . 
Potluck at the Grizzled Wizard . Shamus ' ribs , < PROPFIRST>'s tacos and some vaguely cajun seafood stew I made . 
So my work has somehow acquired the Twilight books . Can someone tell me what book and chapter the scene where < PROPFEMALE > gets a cesarean section via the werewolf dude's teeth because her vampire baby is trying to punch it's way out of her womb ? I really just want to read that one part . 
Grizzled Wizard potluck tomorrow for the Hawks game . Even if you don't cook show up . 
Fuck yeah . DAT WHO !

I'm thinking Hawks moneyline , Pats spread and Hawks spread parlayed with the under . Pays 950 if I win all with 400 outlay . Thoughts ? 
Every single bet I wanted to place yesterday failed . Thank god victimless crime has a bedtime around midnight ! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > still owes me 100 bucks . 
Like times of old . 
I don't care how good your event is , if you put it up against the fucking Superbowl , you are a retarded person .

Best $7 cover in yars3 
QOTD You get too close to me and I will spit on you . It aint sensual and I aint clean . 
Pulled a Platinum Angel from a 2011 Core Set pack today . Watched The Isand and now Tango And Cash . 
I have pretty good luck with packs . Usually something I can use or something valuable it seems . Values drop once things rotate out of standard though . 
Daddy got a Droid . App suggestions ? 
Read a heated internet debate on how to cook scallops and now I really want scallops . For the record , I'm firmly in the less is more camp . Butter ( or bacon grease ) , lemon , garlic , salt , pepper is all you ever need . Serve with crusty bread . DO NOT OVERCOOK . 
Gastropub . I hate the word gastropub . 
Deep fried bananas rock . Didn't see that coming .

\The final war will be between Schrodinger's cat and Pavlov's dog . \ " \ 
Dear Paseo . I tried your chicken today because you were out of sandwiches . How can you afford to sell half chickens with a side of rice for $5.50 and have it be so awesome ? Also , slopping some chicken juice on the rice is a nice touch . 
Chinese is playing the < PROPFEMALE > tonight and I shall be there . 
It occurred to me a minute ago that I picked up more of my morality from FFIV than the bible . 
Trailer Park Boys . Digging it so far . Bubbles is fucking amazing . It's like The Office of losers . 
If you are the type of person who constantly describes themselves as random , there is a good < PROPMALE > I will find you utterly predictable . 
There . are days when my job sucks and days like today . This was RAD . It is the wonderful cats I work with that make the diffetence . 
Live reporting from Westlake Center woodcarver shooting protest via < PROPMALE > W . : Seattle police just hit a protester with a cruiser and are using horses and gas to try to disperse people ... 
I STAND WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD . Also PBS , various middle eastern countries , Wisconsin , people who don't shoot woodcarvers , Wikileaks and various other causes I am no doubt forgetting . 
I just had one of those moments where I looked at a < PROPFEMALE > and was like HOLY SHIT , THAT'S A MOTHERFUCKING GLOWING BALL OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM ENGAGED IN A LONG TERM NUCLEAR REACTION AT LEAST 4 LIGHT YEARS AWAY moments . Then it was gone . 
I had a dream that involved hostage negotiation , heavy weaponry and the mobile ticket scanning app for Android phones . Action / adventure dreams are pretty rare for me . 
Bisping by illegal knee . Fitch got robbed . The post main event fight between the fat guy and the guy with the slightly darker fat was the highlight . Got to admire lighter fat dude for attempting to drown his opponent in blood . Two fat guys with Tito haircuts enter . One fat guy with a Tito haircut leaves . Overall it sucked . 
Quick And Easy Boys are fucking really good . 
So I was just attacked by a homeless guy I gave two bucks to for some creepy line drawings . I haven't been in a fight since 9th grade . 
\Thanks for choosing DoubleTree by < PROPMALE > . \ 
Lesbian and Whitehorse at the Funhouse tonight . 
Ahh , off work . You know what would be good right now ? Between 6 and 10 glasses of merlot . 
Dear bands and venues . Posting 6 updates in 10 minutes is more annoying and less effective than posting one a day for 6 days . Hootsuite and Tweetdeck . Google . 
I haven't had to think this hard at work in a long , long time . My brain hurts but it also kind of feels like I'm high . High on nerd endorphins . MATH : NOT EVEN ONCE .

3.5 hours into ticket scanner event and no calls yet from the producer . 7.5 hours to go . This makes me very happy ... so far . 
This would seem to indicate that the panspermia hypothesis of how life got started on earth is more likely than previously thought . It could also be that the meteor has an earthly terrestrial origin : http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html 
So people are going to have to walk through the entire event to get their tickets scanned . Wifi requires a browser to log in . Looks like I'm getting up early . 
Heaven Hill bourbon . It tastes like camping and firearms . 
Printer in office suite was out of papet . Paper door on copier locked . Removed ink cartridge in copier , removed plastic wall . Gained paper . 
I've eaten nothing but cheesesteaks since I landed . 
Drug dealers here are really forward . One even sang his product line walking by . 
That went amazingly well . 
The Brown Paper Tickets cheesesteak taste test results : Two votes for Geno's , one for < PROPFIRST>'s . My personal favorite was Ishkabibble's though . 
Does Seattle have a signature dish ? Like Philly has cheesesteaks and Buffalo has wings ? 
Nate Dogg died . Sad .

If I ever run out of stories you haven't heard remind me that I know three convicted murderers and once worked in group homes with the retarded . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > . I'll remember you for a lot of reasons but I think the most statistically significant is 10K games of < PROPFIRST > Kart and 5K of 007 . Easily . 
Hummus , last time you won but by god this time I am going to kick your Mediterreanian ass . Feta ! Katamala ! Engage ! 
Nothing like a funeral or wedding to get you back in touch with kids you love . 
It's nice to be such a regular at a bar that the staff offer you rides home even thoughyou are fairly sober and live 8 blocks away . Wallingford is family to me . 
I work with cooler kids than you do . 
The swedish meatball pie from Pie in Fremont comes with the highest recommendations . You'd think the lingonberry sauce would throw it off , but then you'd be wrong . The macaroni and cheese with peas pie is just okay though .

Congrats to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > for making a Thursday night door sell like a Saturday show . I'm 20 heads from calling the fire department myself . 
Something has to go horribly wrong today . I had one unread email in my work inbox and it is a sales list for a fake event I created . By way of contrast , yesterday I had 57 . 
I'm a Rainbow Gathering vet . What is the difference between that and Burning Man ? 
In brightest day , in blackest night ... 
My Little Pony : Friendship Is Magic is among the finest kids shows ever . Lots of Adult Swim / Cartoon Network talent . At least watch the two part miniseries .

Ham is like the Pokemon of meats . It starts out basic , like just ham , then evolves into sandwiches and finally transforms into a lentil or split pea soup . Fuckin ' love ham . 
Was stuck in Final Fantasy 1 for three days because I didn't realize I had already completed the Earth Cavern on accident . I'm now like 10 levels above where I should be . 
So a guy walked into my office today wasted and smoking a cigarette well after dark . He mumbled something and was asked if he needed anything . He apparently did not and left .
