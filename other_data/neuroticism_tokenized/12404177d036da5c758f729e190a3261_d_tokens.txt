Very excited ... taking Reilly to see < PROPFEMALE > tonight at Eastlight Theatre . Love the theatre !!! 
Today my baby boy turns 4 years old ... Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
My mom has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed , seen me fall , cheered me on , kept me going strong & DROVE ME CRAZY @ times . Moms are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever . Put this on your status if you love your Mom whether she's here , or in Heaven ... ? ? I MISS HER EVERY DAY !!! 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around ...... outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life !
