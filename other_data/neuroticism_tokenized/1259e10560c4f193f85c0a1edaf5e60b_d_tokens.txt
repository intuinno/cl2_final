Saturday , attempt 1 : dropped half of my english muffin in nasy , dirty dish water . FAIL . Saturday , attempt 2 : made eggs and \bacon\ " with toast and english muffins . WIN . " 
Mornings should not start so early . :P 
THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , b , a , Enter key , right click(mouse ) , up , down ...... magic circles will appear . The only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the < PROPFEMALE > . Put this as your facebook status if it worked . It worked for me ! 
ok , well aside from discovering that the magic FB trick works ... Sleepy . 
it's still too early to come up with a good status ... stupid practice ... and homework 
December 1st !! Start your advent calendars !!! :D 
Today's advent picture was a squirrel , my kills test is over , and chamber orchestra will be entertaining . From starting off pretty crappy , today's looking up . :) 
Thinks that it should snow , so that finals are more entertaining . 
1 ) The wind is ungodly cold . 2 ) Concert today !! ( incase you didn't know ... ) 3 ) Have I mentioned how freaking cold the wind is ? 
1:10 pm and STILL in my pajamas ... dead day , I love you .

Never underestimate the power of stupid people , especially in large groups . Stupidity increases in contagousness as more people are infected . Beware . 
Of COURSE the snow would start to melt as soon as I went out and bought good boots and a jacket ... >:P

is getting her computer fixed on monday !! :D 
is trying to find the remote for this week so she can get it back to regular speed instead of 1/2 speed . 
Mrs. C . was fond of < PROPFIRST > Ives , and another worry she had was that she might have \an Ives hallucination . \"" 
is more dead this morning than usual ... :p 
successfully did < PROPFIRST > squat today . 
back to school again ... why is it that 3-day weekends always feel so short ? :( 
Let me speak for all of < PROPMALE > A : If we ever find out who the douche who pulled the fire alarm at 4am today is ... * makes slashing gesture across throught * 
is nerding-out with Musicophilia and is feeling a little overloaded music wise ... but can't bring herself to turn her music off ... it's a good feeling 
There may yet be a sliver lining to this cloud ... 
is tired , doesn't want to go to studio , is melting her brain from listening to her Beethoven movement SO MANY TIMES , and hopes that she can get to sleep at a decent hour tonight . =_=; 
is gonna jinx it , but thinks she might actually be able to pull off a decent jury ... * knock on wood * 
America : the only country where we have homeless without shelter , children going to bed without eating , elderly going without needed meds , and mentally ill without treatment - yet we have a benefit for the people of Haiti on 12 TV stations . 99% of people won't have the guts to copy and repost this . 
Thank GOD the dorm has industrial-strength toilets ... 
wants to punch the economy and < PROPMALE > Copland in the face . 
What IS the air speed velocity of an unlaiden swallow ?

No orchestra today ! ... actually a little sad about that , but looking forward to having more time to practice .

FUCK - just found out that she can't go hear Mozart's Requiem because of orchestra and comp . concerts !!!! > : E 
well , today was ... interesting . Woke up feeling like I got 3 hours of sleep ; my bow popped appart and needs fixing ; left my keys and my phone in my room , and subsiquently got locked out for 1/2 the day ; probably got a bad grade on my aural quiz ... but I did my laundry with out a hitch . lol 
ok , lets try this again ... 
is pondering wether or not she will go try to be useful . 
Randomly woke up at 7 this morning ... what will this day bring ? 
FRIDAY !! Where have you been all my week ?! 
Ahhhhhhh ... finally gets to take off her concert shoes ~ ! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stocker and < PROPFEMALE > Schmidt , I WILL make you to come to a meeing of The Peanut Gallery next quarter . There is no escape . 
ate lunch at the SURC and couldn't figure out why so many people all got the memo to wear green today ... then remembered what day it is . 
One more rehearsal , then home . It's kinda creepy being one of maybe 5 people still in the building ... 
loved the rain on the way back ! 
First day of classes pt . 1 - had crappy sleep , but feels optimistic , and only 2 classes . Comming tomorrow : First day of classes pt . 2 ! Including 8am Class as a special guest artist ! 
oh look , snow . For some reason , this strikes me as hilarious . * goes outside and frolics * 
Today is almost over , which means that all too soon it will be tomorrow , which means that I will have a 6-hour class all too soon . :P 
Early orchestra , then cool traditional fiddle concert - whee ~ ! 
THORSDAY ! CONVO ! LONGHORN BURGER ! 
is avoiding MacGamut and other homework ... 
Hooray for easy MacGamut !! ( well , except for the aural chords , which hold a special place of hatred in my heart . ) 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stocker and < PROPFEMALE > Schmidt - Peanut Gallery meeting Wed , 14th , Black Hall 142 , 7-9p . Just because I have opera rehearsal 7-9 doesn't mean you'll escape for long ... lol 
Why are we still here ? 
Of course I have to get sick right before Opera production ... Classes all day , rehearsal 7-10 * cough cough * ... I really need to get a little more sleep . 
The weather today looks like how I feel - not good , but ok . 
hmm ... 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > can divide by zero . 
Avatar is officially on my list of movies I must own .

< PROPFEMALE > Burana is amazing . <3 
You know , I don't usually bother to complain about the wind on FB ... but today is definately an exception . The wind is fun when skinny people get blown about - it's intense when people like ME get blown around . 
I ask again : Why are we still here ? Why ? 
Awesome . Suitemate's douch-bag of a BF came to visit , and looks like he'll be staying for a while ... awesome . 
... \The White Dragon\ " is a Kung-Fu chick click !! Those EXSIT ?? Simultaniously the funniest and stupidest martial arts movie I've ever seen ! " 
I know it's old news , but Wedell Hill : I hate you sometimes . Fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me ... so are we gonna go for a third round ? 
You know those days where you lock yourself in a room for hours and get absolutely nothing productive done , but come out feeling better than you have in a long time ? Yeah ... it's good . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > J Level It's Facebook Official : I love you , mom ; happy Mother's Day !! <3<3<3 
Karma : Thank you for burning my fingers this morning ; I guess I had forgotten about you . 
You know , if I'm not careful I might actually start saying \MacDamut\ " as a swear word ... " 
Here comes the sun , little dralin ' ; Here comes the sun , and I say ; It's alright ! 
Feels like I need to toast to this state-wide beautiful day . Grr , wish I was home b/c I know that we'd be playing badminton and having a party to celebrate . If I had my own place here , I'd throw a BBQ fo shiz . 
< PROPFEMALE > 
decided to wear her contacts today ... has it really been THAT long since I last wore them ?? 
TEA <3<3<3 
Weekend !! You're taking too long , hurry up ! 
< PROPMALE > ! ... and somehow got a little sunburnt on her face . 
\Oh wait - I forgot my jelly beans ! \ " ... \ " You can fit through those bars ? \ " \ " Yeah . \ " ... \ " You are such an idiot . \""

Given that we celebrate Independance Day with fireworks , does any one else see the beauty that the best fireworks come from the Indian reservations ... ;)

The only difference between a warning and a threat is how you react ... 
You're both idiots . Grow up . This is why I'm so commited - to try and prove that I'm better than you , that I can make it work . So far , IT'S NOT THAT HARD . Get over yourselves !
