Hey ! How are things going ? Are you home now ? 

Thank you ! 
Thank you ! I am not sure if < PROPMALE > has told you or not ... our house sold today and the inspection was great ! We are thrilled ! We can not wait for the house to be built and to share our home with the church . 
< PROPMALE > has to get glasses and he's NOT happy . He said , \I just want my own eyeballs ! \ " I am REALLY worried about next week when they come in ! Thanks to Sponge < PROPMALE > we found a pair with that logo on them ! " 
We went to see the \Tooth Fairy\ " last night and < PROPMALE > lost a tooth in the movie . He thinks < PROPMALE > came and brought his money . " 
Our refrigerator went out and we had just restocked at the grocery store ! DRATS ! 
Woo hooo ! I slept late for the first time in months ! Everyone is still asleep and I can play on the computer in peace and quiet ! 
I really think spring break is overloading FB and I am not able to indulge in my games because everyone else is doing the same . There is something not quite right ! 
We are going to get < PROPFEMALE>'s flower girl dress today . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > will be in < PROPFEMALE > Harrington's wedding in June . 
I have to part with my 2 sweet kitties due to severe allergies . They're declawed , fixed & litter box trained ( which also describes my husband ) . They REALLY need a good home . One is shy the other is a cuddle bug . If you are willing or know of someone that would love a sweet , adorable , cute loving < PROPFEMALE > please let me know . I will take them to the vet for a check-up , give you food , litter & a box . 
Our second grade went to Literacy on the Lawn today at the Governor's Mansion today and it was FABULOUS ! I think it was the BEST field trip I have had in 20 years of teaching ! I even got a picture of my class with \first Lady < PROPFEMALE > Beebe ! \"" 
We went to Pinnacle mountain today and it was glorious !!! 
I'm at < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s soccer game . < PROPMALE > is the goalie tonight . He has decided that the soccer field is the place to do cartwheels . So , if he's not doing cartwheels he's drawing in the dirt with a stick ! 
< PROPFEMALE > had an appointment today in Little Rock . After driving in the I30/430 7 a.m. traffic . I will start praying for all Little < PROPMALE > commuters . It was nightmarish experience ! 
My question is this ... when we've lost all of our soccer games but 1 - how in the world is it possible we're in a tournament ?! 
< PROPMALE > was reading his nightly Bible story to the twins . Tonight's story was about < PROPMALE > praying for wisdom . At the end of the story < PROPMALE > told the kids they needed to pray for wisdom tonight . < PROPMALE > in his prayer asked that our dog have wisdom , our fish to have wisdom and that ALL the crazy people have wisdom . 
Negative people wear me out . I pray to the good Lord I am never like this . Sing and be happy . 
I need shoeboxes for super summer . If anyone happens to have any they want to get rid of I'd gladly take them off your hands . 
I'm going to stamp camp in a few hours this is my first time in a month for time for fun , creativity , and time with good friends . Woo Hoo ! 
My summer break has finally started right NOW !!! Yippee !!!!!! I'll be sleeping late tomorrow . 
Gray is NOT a boring color . Think of a dolphin as it swims GRACEFULLY in the ocean , a gray horse as it runs POWERFULLY across a field , and some tornados are gray and they are SO not boring they are TERRIFYING ! I know a little boy ( < PROPMALE > ) that thinks under ( gun metal gray ) man-holes covers that's where the Ninja Turtles live . IMAGINATION and INNOCENCE ... think before you say something is BORING !! 
Oh , Lord , deliver me from the pain of negativity . 
My heart REALLY did flutter when I saw Hogwarts !!!! 
Oh my word Butterbeer is better than I imagined !!!! 
I'll be painting my classroom tomorrow . I know I'll have more on me than on the walls . Wish me luck ! Thank you < PROPMALE > Trantham , < PROPMALE > Wray , and Briar Sample . If it weren't for you guys I wouldn't be able to do it ! Three great guys willing to help an old teacher . 
I went to a WONDERFUL workshop today on upper level books ! I am SO excited ! I won two books in the class and I can not wait to read them so I can share them with my 4th grade class next year ! What fun it will be ! 
At the ER at Children's with < PROPMALE > . He fell and hit his head . First time at ER at Children's . 
While shopping at Wal-Mart today < PROPMALE > found a Wonka bar with a label that said , \Find a < PROPFEMALE > Ticket . \ " < PROPMALE > begged me for it . I told him he could have one . He started immediately praying . \ " Dear Father in Heaven please let me find the < PROPFEMALE > Ticket so I can go to the chocolate factory ! \"" 
Oh my word ! I never realized this Salt Bowl was so serious ! Traffic on 30 is horrid ! I've almost gotten whiplash from < PROPMALE>'s driving . 
Just went to The Old Mill . It was my first time there . Wow , it sure was pretty ! 
< PROPMALE > won the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes !!! WOO HOO !! 
Thanks for all of the birthday wishes . Everyone made my day . 
I'm thankful for : my wonderful husband that led me to Christ , beautiful twins that keep me busy , and 125 of the best fourth graders that I'm blessed to teach . I do have some pretty awesome coworkers as well . 
I need a really delicious dip recipe and it needs to be a dip that has been cooked ( warm/hot ) . It can not be a spinach dip . 
I'm tired of waking up at 1:00 and not going back to sleep . This no sleep stuff can wear you out QUICK ! 
Why do they tell you a month in advance be here 15 minutes early for your doctor's appointment and then you wait for over an hour or more to see a doctor ? 
Been awake for over an hour . Now < PROPMALE > is awake . Welcome to the world of insomnia . I'm going to snuggle with my little guy . 
I'm thankful for wal-mart right now . They had small bags that I purchased and I didn't have to wrap 24 gifts for my students !! Woo hoo ! I am so relieved and it was such a time saver !! 
We went to a Christmas party last night and < PROPFEMALE > Claus was there . He brought gifts to the children . < PROPMALE > got a Monsters 4 legos game . Well , a few minutes ago he came into my bedroom with the game and said , \I love my game SO much ! I even slept with it last night . \ " . Oh to be young and full of excitement for toys . Can you imagine sleeping with a box ? " 
I'm loving this sleeping late and hot cocoa in bed from my sweet little boy . I could get spoiled to this real quick !! 
My resolutions for the new year : 1 ) NO more kidney stones 2 ) read my grandfather's bible and his side notes 3 ) go to the gym more . 4 ) Soar with eagles and not get distracted by that one cuckoo bird ! 
Please pray for two good friends of mine . One was in remission and her cancer has returned . Another was diagnosed with Birkitt's lymphoma and had chemo last night and he really needs prayers after the chemo .
