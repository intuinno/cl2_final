Trying to speak in a damn Russian accent , but it's coming out British . I also cannot say the word ' slaughter ' in the accent . It keeps coming out ' slaufter ' O-o WHAT . THE . HELL . 
Okay so i can speak in a cowboy accent perfectly but not a Russian accent ?! D:< damn wyomin ' . 
So today i have learned , if i want to speak in a british accent , i have to try to speak in a Russian accent , and if i wanna speak like a cowboy , it's pretty much second nature 8-8

First time you broke my heart , it took a while to heal . Second time you broke my heart , i decided you definitely aren't worth it and i actually saw it coming . There isn't going to be a third time , stop messaging me , stop calling me , we've been through this . 
5:04 in the morning . Going to bed soon ~ * Yawns * I got a lot done . Now On Summer Vacation ~ ! 
Stressed , Supposed to be grounded till Friday , for whatever reason , and I may have gotten another week . I kinda regret not going to school this week . I pulled an all nighter too . 
For some reason , when i was woken up at two in the morning , instead of going back to sleep i took a shower . Dude what the hell . 
Spent about ........ 5 hours in the fucking hospital last night .... I have to get surgery in the next few months . Gah , this sucks so bad ..... 
Blegh , i feel sick still . >_> ....... I'm gonna try to take my step-sister to < PROPFEMALE > Canyon's pool tomorrow . COME ! XD lol 
I love how on the days I don't have attacks , i get the throat thing from my step-sis and now i can't talk , laugh or do anything . ._. Yet < PROPFIRST > keeps making me laugh , and i keep teasing her about being an Ostritch . <3 My Austria . 
At 9:30 , i was kidnapped by my Grandparents for three hours . 8D .............. I HAVEN'T EVEN GONE TO BED YET . 
I'm almost on hour 36 of being awake .... At first i was just going for 48 hours , but now i'm gonna see how long i can go before i pass out . 
Update : Hour 37 : 2nd cup of coffee , slightly out of it , and i am slowly getting better at typing .... more or less . At least i didn't black out for a few seconds again . 
Hour 39 ... I think .... Ha ~ I'm wide awake now , still on my second cup of cofee ~ 
Hour 40 ... Finally here . * sighs * 8 hours and about 40 minutes and i'll have been up for two days * eye roll * ewe 
Hour 41 : Worst hour of the 48 hours . Let's just go with that . Lack of Sleep symptoms : Dizzy Spells . 
Hour 42 : I feel so much better . I love the people around me . <3 
43 : It's all getting easier now . Just five more ! 8D 
45 ..................... I'm kinda tired . * shrugs * Waiting for everyone to wake up . 
47 : ewe shaking , it's so cold down here in the basement . 
48 hours ...... That got really slow towards the end . ewe 
Surgery next thursday . i can't wait , only a little bit longer until i get rid of this stupid organ and start finally feeling better . 
I'm not getting my surgery this thursday anymore , still really annoyed by that . This afternoon was not very pleasant . 
Well .... i've officially stayed up to at least 6 am everyday for a week . :/ I need to get out of this place ..... I wanna go to Wyoming for my birthday . Getting stircrazy . :/ 
Started working at convincing my parents to let me go to NDK again . I've pretty much got ' em . 
I'm just so annoyed , and i can't stop crying . Why do people insist on making me really mad on days that are supposed to be good ? I just don't care anymore .... In other news , my hair is short again , tomorrow when mom gets home we're finishing it and dyeing it . 
Going to finish cutting my hair and dye it tomorrow ~ ??? 
Okay , so apparently we aren't doing my hair til about .... Sunday or Monday , if it's wednesday , i'll be annoyed . I think we should have a BBQ or something . 
\\( ° ? ° )/ ............ I'm tired ............. Gonna go to bed now , no more allnighters D8 . 
Birthday is in 3 days . awesome . I still wanna have a BBQ , but i have no clue if we're doing anything . I'm bored , < PROPFIRST>'s not here to entertain me xD We gotta go get new ice cream that doesn't taste like store-made cake \\( ° ? ° )/ 
I love how on Saturday i said i was pulling no more All nighters ..... ewe . 
Hanging out with my mom later today , getting ready for my birthday tomorrow . Still don't know if we are doing anything though :/ 
It's my birthday Officially now !!!!! Awesome ! 
Ha ha , today is a good day . Even though my cat decided to wake me up at 6:30 and wouldn't go away . 
I JUST GOT A CAKE IN THE MAIL . I didn't even know you could do that ! 8D I love you < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
As of 5 minutes ago , I am 17 ~ Whooooooo ~ ! 
Gotta get up in 6 hours to go to the hospital . Yay ! xD at least i won't have to waste all day . 
Just got back from the hospital a little while ago . I am just tired and a little sore . 
First day of healing is going pretty good .... well .... except for me over exerting myself , but i'm just that special . Gonna go to bed soon , night everyone ! <3 
All allllllloooooone for now <3 I hope my parents stay at the canyon so that my brother can come over and we can < PROPFEMALE > out ... or something . I can't type :/ 8D 
Gah , I hurt today . Damn my stomach . Hanging out with my brother , it's pretty fun . I'm surprised i didn't pass out much today , i guess i am finally winning against the pain meds :) 
So , apparently i am now suffering from what those in the medical business call ' Subconjunctional Hemorrhaging ' or what I like to call ' Zombie Eye Syndrome ' It looks fucking awesome . <3 
I just learned that I have the Subconjunctional Hemorrhaging in both eyes . FML . 
Just got my Senior Year schedule . It fucking sucks . :/ My mom let that bitch pick all of my classes . I wanted AP European History and < PROPMALE > 2 , I got Law Enforcement and American Sign language . * twitches * 
I'm exhausted . ASL is an odd , odd little class ..... Not little actually . Can it be next Friday night already ? 
I have many ideas for next weekend , I am so happy ! Awesomest thing that will be happening to me since .... I don't know when !

I'm easily amused oh wow . Going to the State Prison tomorrow morning ~ . I promise i didn't do anything xD 
Bleh , I don't feel good now . I still have to go to school tomorrow though . Thursday , I'm just staying home ! Hell yes !

FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUU- MY MOM JUST UNKNOWINGLY PULLED A GIANT PRANK ON ME . I pass out a few hours ago since I was kinda sick , so when she got home , she woke me up and said something about it being almost 7 and something about school , so I was freaking out and texted my friend , and then I saw the clock . : I I feel stupid now ... 
What the hell . The Minute Maid commercial just went ' It's like a rainbow ! Wait no , a double rainbow ! OMG Double rainbow!!!!' eAe 
I think I may be going to school on maybe monday .... Oh Damn . : I 
I love how I have a fever but my nose is frozen as are me feet , just from chilling in the basement ... At this point , that is a literal term . 
Yay ! Home alone again ! Yay !..... Fuck it , I'm playing Bioshock and other things . C : 
FFFFFFF-This is why I can't play Bioshock late at night . I saw a shadow run across my boat and flipped . -is now locked in room with Tank , pasta , < PROPFEMALE > M&M's and Devil- ; 7 ;\ 
Only video games do this to me too ... Devil also isn't bad for an M . Night Shamallama ( rofl the inside jokes ) movie . WHAT A TWIST . 
So , my parents went on about a forty or so minute search for me . It took them that long to realize that I had fallen asleep on the couch .
