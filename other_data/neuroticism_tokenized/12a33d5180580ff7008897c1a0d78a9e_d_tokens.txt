Make this your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Cubs Fan . Being a Cubs Fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for CF and sympathy does not help but we can raise awareness . 100% of Cardinals fans will repost this ... Simply because we know how to copy and paste as well as tie our shoes ..
