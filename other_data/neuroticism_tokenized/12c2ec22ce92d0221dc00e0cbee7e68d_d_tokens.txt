< PROPMALE > <3 
THIS STORY IS DEPRESSING ! I'm starting to think that girls have masochistic tendencies when it comes to guys ...

Men are selfish ; that's the sad truth , ladies .

PoliSci paperof Doom is complete ! Success ! 
I have , once again , rediscovered the awesomeness of youtube !

Apparently , I have a very accurate intuition ... in this case it's a bad thing :/ 
This one prof really bugs me ... 
History Paper of Doom is complete ! Victory ! 
I'm starting to remember why I chose the < PROPMALE > I chose :)

Back from Vegas trip ! 
Does NOT want Spring Break to end ! 
... so the rain finally made it here 
I wish < PROPFIRST > would come back to teaching Russian .... AND PUT OUR GRADES UP ALREADY ! 
“I waited for you , Jack , ” she said , looking up at him with wide , vulnerable eyes . “I waited for you Did you think I was going to wait my whole life ? ” 
So why doesn't it feel like Friday ? 
just had the most disturbing conversation about sexual fantasies and incest ... 
Today was pretty much WIN :D 
really needs a PoliSci IR research topic :/ 
My computer just gave me the BIGGEST F-ING SCARE ! 
I don't get cladograms when they're drawn diagonaly :'( 
has come to the conclusion that she's not a very good fencer 
Study insanity has come early this term :/ 
I LOATHE scantrons ! 
is actually doing a pretty good job not procrastinating :) 
My printer is a pain in the ass ... 
has a bad tendency of developing crushes on movie/book characters ... 
\It's nice to know that you were there . Thanks for acting like you cared and making me feel like I was the only one . It's nice to know we had it all . Thanks for watching as I fall ... \"" 
Why are there no fencing classes offered next term ? :( 
needs to focus but CAN'T because one can only write so many papers before overload 
is apparently incapable of doing things ahead of time ... 
thinks it's actually kinda fab that she gets to write a paper on Dolokhov . 
should be going to bed but will probably end up watching LOST anyways 
Is trying to bribe herself into writing her paper -- after every 1 < PROPFEMALE > written I get to watch 1 episode of LOST . 
FML 
“Use the Source , Locke !. ” 
you'd think people would get the idea of being at least moderately quiet in a place called \the study room \"" 
Two new pairs of shades ! WIN 
The series finale of LOST has such an \original\ " title -- \ " The End \"" 
A book about boy ! love in a lit class ? I think that's made of WIN :) 
Epic fencing today :D 
realized that she’s actually not that fond of skipping class 
I just love how my scanners insist of disagreeing with each other 
Sort of misses her Theoretical family of White Russians :p Oh High School days , I miss you much at times . 
First time making a PowerPoint in ages .... 
about to give a presentation in front of a lecture hall with over 100 people in it ... eeep ... pray for me ! 
If you like this status , I will post on your wall something I like about you . Make this as your status if you want a challenge . 
\We spent all our money on stupid things but if I look back now I'd probably give it all away ... just for one more day . One more day with you . \"" 
Just realised that my schedual doesn't allow for either fencing club or theatrical fencing next quarter D: 
There is something horribly wrong about the fact that I'm writing a paper on Friday night :/ 
One down , three to go ! 
Oh the ways I find to procrastinate :p 
You know that feeling ? The one when you really love someone and really want to be there for them but don't know what to do ? Yea , that one . It sucks . 
Feels very smart right now * smug * :D 
3 down , 1 to go ! 
just a bit overwhelmed ... but no motivation to pull an all-nighter ... 
4 down , 0 to go ! VICTORY ! 
My LSAT prep books came today ... it's a bit terrifying . 
Cam High grad today ... Seriously , wtf ? 
Congratulations , ACHS class of 2010 ! 
USA hanging in there :D 
Lol , so happy right now :D 
A in Dinos despite all odds ! < PROPFIRST > - 1 , College - 0 !!! 
I either need a magic spell to shrink all my clothes/shoes/purses or a MUCH bigger suitcase ! 
Packing ... with limited success 
feels super lightheaded ... 
Epic packing finally complete ( hopefully I didn't forget anything ) 
In Moscow ! Germany was great ! 
WTF , < PROPFEMALE > ? WTF ? 
Russian beaurocracy in action = ridiculous ( and a pain in\ 
the ass ) . 
OMG GOAL ! 
GOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLl !!! 
Wtf , ref ? THAT WAS OUR GOAL ! 
England-Algeria game a-ha 
How lovely =) 
feels really retarded right now ( given how long it took me to figure out how to set my folders details view as default ) :/ 
Just had the most delicious icecream :D 
has a craving to write boy ! love 
Game time . LETS GO USA !!! 
One goal , guys ! That's all it takes , just one ! 
WE DID IT ! WE DID IT ! 
Lets go , Slovakia , lets go !

Stupid Ghana . 
Thanks for a great World Cup , boys . USA FOREVER <3 
Fave boy names : Anatole , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > . Fave girl names ; < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > ( < PROPFEMALE > ) , < PROPFEMALE > . <--- This status has no point whatsoever . 
Tour cruise tomorrow . See ya'll in a week . 
I go to Russia twice a year and I still get the occasional culture shock O_o 
Bye-bye civilization for at least two weeks ( probably more like a month ) * waves goodbye * 
BACK TO CIVILIZATION ! 
\Just gonna stand there and watch me burn . That's alright because I like the way it hurts . Just gonna stand there and hear me cry . That's alright because I love the way you lie ... \""

Last night = awesome :D 
Should be packing .... am procrastinating ... 
From \a total mess\ " to \ " almost done\ " in under an hour . That's what I call teamwork and expert packing skills :D " 
Lightbulb explosion O_o 
Is home . 
It's like I don't even know you anymore ... 
Updating my IPhone software turned out to be a hell of a lot more hastle than it was worth . 
is very very very very very very very very very very very very annoyed . 
Meh 
loves easily accesible customer service :) 
hates when stories/rps/tv shows/other fun things die on you :/ 
enjoyed watching really really old ( like they're-recorded-on-VCR-tapes old ) home movies with her mom . 
thinks the Government Task Force On Defining the Middle Class are jerks for saying that to be middle class you have to own a car :/ 
Move In info arrived .... I hate having to be on the first floor :( 
School suplies shopping -- Check ( for now ) 
loves how much < PROPMALE > Imamura believes in her :) 
loves music identification apps :)

Has begun considering job options ... 
needs new breaks on her bike . 
Movie night with < PROPFIRST > White was a success :) 
Chinese food :D 
Apparently my brain has decided to take a vacation today ... 
My connection comes and goes ... it SUCKS D:

Is getting her first very own cooking utensils ;) 
Operation Baby Dorm shopping is complete .

Why can't everything just work properly and make my life THAT much easier ? 
Freshmeeeeeen !!! (: p ) 
That one intersection is retarded . ( It should not have taken me that long to find the rlRecCen ) 
Has totally overscheduled herself 
My baby brother has now called me on the phone several times ( which is new ) . It's ADORABLE <3 
thinks she and < PROPFIRST > White need more awesome/stupid inside jokes ( or need to remember their old ones at least ) . 
Gauchos FTW ! 
GOOOAL !!!!!! 
2-1 UCSB win !!! 
Afterpartyyyyyyy 
At first I thought all that noise was coming from DP ... but now I'm thinking it's coming from another direction but I can't figure out what/where it might be . 
is entirely too proud of herself at the moment . 
My refrigerated water bottles are gonna really come in handy today ... 
is still pissed off at herself for missing that deadline :( 
The good thing about a two hour class in the SSMS computer lab ? It's a hell of a lot cooler here there in my room :/ 
I dare you : next time you're on a date , tell the girl that she is \pulchritudinous\ " :p " 
Straight guys could really take some tips from gay boys . Really . 
There shall be Maroon5 and OneRepublic in my life on Wednesday :) 
That's 1-0 against < PROPMALE > :D 
UCSB victory !!! 
Tonight was full of WIN :D 
My mouth is so swollen ...

Show time ! 
Amazing night with < PROPFIRST > Reinhart , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Brown and < PROPFEMALE > <3 
is officialy not screwed anymore \\0/ 
loves it when they cancel class :D 
1\ 
of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is\ 
instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , \ 
andso much else all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens\ 
are going to commit suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell\ 
them life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy\ 
and paste this . 
I'm not short , I'm fun size . [( c ) < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Lord ] 
3 hr class ?! Whaaat ? O_o 
WHY DOES SOMETHING SO BASIC AS EDGE FEATHERING HAVE TO BE SO HARD IN PHOTOSHOP !? 
Relief is an awesome feeling . 
Note to self : Think next time . 
now has a Halloween constume . ( It makes me thing of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Sy , < PROPMALE > Orlina and that one awesome history project :p ) 
has suddenly lost all ability to concentrate on her homework ... 
And it's up before the deadline :D 
Is anyone going to the Cal Poly game tonight ? [ Tag : < PROPMALE > Imamura , < PROPFEMALE > O'Connor ] 
I love profs who actually try to work with you and figure stuff out and keep your interests in mind ... I might survive this class after all . 
agh ... continuous headache :( 
IT'S YULETIDE TIME AGAIN !!! 
I have an unhealthy love for the word \snuggle \"" 
It's the weekend , bitches ! It's the weekend ! 
Come on gauchos ! Let's kick some private school ass ! 
Duke has been defeated !!! 
* wakes up * * realises soccer practice is ln like 2 two hours * fml 
Seriously hope the rain doesn't start up for at least another couple of hours ... 
I HEAR THUNDER 
Arghh . A cold is the LAST thing I need right now . 
Wear purple tomorrow to honor the 6 boys who recently committed suicide as a\ 
result of being tormented for being gay . This is not about gay rights , \ 
politics or religion . This event is about loving people . We need to\ 
make an effort to show love for every single human being , so that teen\ 
suicides end . I only wish we had done this before these young men took\ 
their lives . ( Taken from Aziza Cano's status ) 
Why don't I have anything purple ? * frustrated * 
is so proud of all the people she saw wearing purple today :) 
Ok , I'll try this : Like\ 
my status & I'll tell you : 1 ) Something I learned about you\ 
bylooking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 ) Color you remind me of . \ 
3)First memory with you . 4 ) Animal you remind me of . 5 ) Ask you\ 
somethingI've always wondered . 6 ) Favorite thing about you . 7 ) Give you\ 
a weirdnickname . 8 ) I challenge you to post this . 
has been rather productive so far today :)

“Moving on , is a simple thing , what it leaves behind is hard . ” 
TOO MUCH HOMEWORK D: 
We won ! ... by forfeit but that's ok :) 
Dear Gay Kids , \ 
We straight kids have feelings too . So don't lead us on . It's not nice . \ 
Love , \ 
< PROPFIRST > 
Oreos and milk :) 
What really hurts is that I was the last to know .

Oh SB oh you're a part of me . So hear me shout hear me shout hear me shout shout shout ! Rain or shine , win or lose my heart belongs to you !

Dear Jazz Prof/TA , \ 
Please give us a study guide for the midterm or I will die . \ 
Despite Reps taking the House , I think I'm rather satisfied with the outcomes of this election .... 
It's official ! Brown is governer ! I'm so f-ing happy . 
This may be a breakthrough . ( Lets hope so , I need it ) 
To go to the basketball game or not to go , that is the current question . 
Let's go gauchos !

My bike's messed up :( 
Russia is a page-hog :p

GOAAAAAAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
We love you Tetteh we do ! We love you Tetteh we do ! Oh Tetteh WE LOVE YOU ! 
I guess we started celebrating too early . The refs are just determined to knock us out . ... 
Wow . Just wow . I don't even ... 
Hey , Berkley , so whose < PROPMALE > daddy paid off the refs ? 
I feel like a giant protest :p 
Inspired by Zach Norgaard's comment , I propose this as a new Loco chant for especially offensive ref behavior :\ 
\ 
A match ! \ 
A pyre ! \ 
Set the ref on fire ! \ 
( this is the last soccer-related status of the day , I swear :p ) 
How did this paper become exclusively about Russia ? O_o 
Thursday night\ 
Mom : I'm sure the Russian club does more than paints Matryoshkas\ 
Friday Class\ 
Larry : So , the Russian club is having a meeting . They will be painting Matryoshkas ... 
Happy Thanksgiving :) 
is in Anaheim 
My brother's team won their first game of tournament :) 
Has conflicted feelings 
Brother's team got 2nd place in tournament . Pretty good , esp considering the season they've had . 
Is back in SB 
Put\ 
this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a LMU\ 
fan . Being a Lion fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . \ 
There is still no known cure for LFD and sympathy does not help , but we\ 
can raise awareness ! 100% of UCSB fans will repost this simply because\ 
we know how to copy and paste , as well as tie our shoes . 
It smells like winter 
Ladies , Pay It Forward Day just means you have an excuse to buy that one cute guy you like a coffee . 
College Cup tickets finaly came :) 
It's really sad to think how much of an impact one incompitant/unfair < PROPFEMALE > can have on your GPA ... 
Gauchos better win tonight :) 
I find her comments insulting . 
WHY AM I ON FACEBOOK ?! 
OMG I'M DONE OMG !!! 
is SO over this class . 
Does anyone want to be incredibly amazing and proof-read my research paper for me ? ( I've read it too many times to notice stuff anymore I think . ) 
Mwahahahahahaha 
Dear Yuletide Story , \ 
Please cooperate with me . This is my first time writing ANYTHING like this so I'd appreciate any help I can get . Besides , you're supposed to be a gift , so try to be extra awesome for us , ok ? \ 
Thanks , \ 
Rain . 
Lifehouse''s \Storm\ " is the best song to write to . " 
Fun time ! Send me a number in a PM and I will post a status about you using your number instead of your name ( therefore it's supposedly anonymous :p ) 
Dear 13 , \ 
Seriously , only you would use IM instead of PM for this ; congrtats on being original :p \ 
I MISS YOU . Forget finals , pay attention to me instead ! :p You're creative and fun and I love how we have moments when we seem to share a brain . I wish you lived closer to me ; we would have so many fun shinanigans ! \ 
Love , \ 
Alex\ 
... PS : You're a pain in the butt too :p 
Money issues blow :/ 
This . Project . Argh .

Slightly delayed 
About to take off for Moscow :)

How did I manage to delete ALL the photos off my camera ? -__- 
This story has a happy ending :D 
ARGH the LAST thing I need right now is writers block ! 
Putting up the Holiday Tree 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to those celebrating it today !!! 
Last night I had a dream involving public bathrooms , RPing and dinosaurs eating people . WTF . 
Is home 
I'm sure there are plenty of ways this day could get worse but it's pretty bad right now as it is ... 
The upside of a busy day ? You get to feel productive . 
Housing drama * argh * 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to me and anyone else who celebrates it today . 
When it seems too good to be true , it probably is . 
THE LEASE HAS BEEN SIGNED ... omg 
First gaucho game of the quarter for me :) missed these 
How did ALL of my midterms end up being on the same week ? :((( 
First time watching the Super Bowl like ever . ( It's actually all about the food :p ) 
is learning about African history . ... Which is actually more interesting than many other histories . 
Ha ! So done with the Week of Doom :D 
She never talks to me anymore . It's sad :/ 
Just had my first ever s'more :D 
Happy Singles Appreciation Day :) 
What is it with \art\ " classes kicking my ass this year ? "

One paper down , one to go . 
Google is taking over the world ...

Thank u everyone for the birthday wishes :) 
One of the best bday weekends ever :d 
Firetruck outside my window .... 
You know , the Social Host Ordinance wouldn't be a problem if this country got a brain and lowered the drinking age to 18 like the rest of the civilized world ... 
Jazz was a useless class for ME . This class is useless period . 
3 down , 1 to go . 
I love how the Russian internet has downgraded versions of popular English net sites : RuTube is the Russian YouTube , diary.ru is the Russian livejournal and ????????? is the Russian facebook . but of course , like most things ripped off and pirated , the quality tends to suffer . 
DONE ! \ 
Spring break commence ! 
is enjoying the rain . 
is very very happy with that < PROPMALE > grade :D 
I . Can't . Stand . Hockey . 
New music , new movies means restocking before going back up to school :)
