Hm I have finnaly decided on my new years resolution , being happy with what I have and what I do and anything I can accomplish \ 
\ 
That is my new years resolution . 

I hate having to fix things that people completely screw up because they are to lazy to find a solution -_- 
After spending around 5 hours reformating a computer , not to mention updating , deleting , and installing , I have come to a realization . \ 
It is obvious that this technology was made by humans , why else would it say \ 1minute\ " then make you wait an hour ? " 
Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg a new season of primeval !!! 
So bored . 
After 1 year and 7 months I have finnally come back to facebook :D \ 
Not gonna be uploading any pictures for awile seeing as i have to add like 20 people . 
How awesome is Zune ? So awesome its got a comment on songs option :D 
Just made me a new account on hackthissite.org gonna learn some hax skills >:D \ 
Please no one laugh when/if my account gets hacked by fellow h4x0r5 lol ... 
I have decided . No pictures on facebook till my hair grows out D: \ 
Short hair hater ^^^^^^^^^^ 
I am FINNALY back on . I just want to say < PROPMALE > to the facebook team and GO DIE to the facebook automatic security for disabling me to begin with >.> \ 
Human : 1 \ 
Machine : 0 
Bored and dreading work like crazy tommorow 
waiting like a good patient child on anything and everything to download just to listen to some music ... >.> 
Has anyone else noticed that the 7th graders get shorter , weirder , and WAY more hyper EVERY SINGLE YEAR ?! 
In the next little while im supposed to be an uncle :D 
Im an uncle now :D You feeling any better < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Is it really so odd that I dont feel like sending a friend request to ANYONE and EVERYONE I have ever met in my life ? 
I am seriously tempted to take this piece o junk computer outback and practicing explosive making and putting it down for good then dipping into the ole savings account and getting a more this decade model -.- 
Havent been able to get on since thursday and oddly enough there is barely anything going on ... odd how when i was gone about 3 days i came back to 200+ recents 
I love my new job 
Isnt it amazing that according to facebook they have over 100 MOST ADDICTING games ? 
gGoing to dads tonight so any < PROPMALE > at seeing any posts will be almost non-existant until sunday x.x 
Its been a good/great day . 
Its gonna be a long long weekend ... \ 
no details will be given so save the effort in commenting ... 
<(*.*<)< (*.*)> (>*.*)> . \ 
< PROPFIRST > dance !!! 
Nothing says weekend at dads like sitting down and doing nothing . -_- 
What is it about a house that can make a person feel so isolated and sad ? 
Only 15 hours until i get to work my longest shift yet at subway . \ 
woo ~ -_- 
Woo I get to stay up till 4 doing random stuff .... 
I feel really nerdy right now \ 
im watching < PROPMALE > play asteroids with every website he pulls up while wearing an ATHF shirt X.X 
Absolutely nothing to do today x.x 
]I think today I learned the one thing that annoys me more than anything else , when friends , family , strangers , and basically just people in general jump 
]to assumptions about a persons life based on something they may have heard and dont even know any details about . That is quiet possibly the most annoying 
] thing that there is , if someone doubts my ability to tolerate annoying things then they have never heard my ringtone -_- 
Cannot believe how fast this week flew by . 
Ugh can't sleep ... I can tell school is gonna be a long one today .... 
IT WAS RAINING SIDEWAYS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Well when you tell your family that you believe different you get to see their true feelings . 
How sad is it when the most exciting part of your day is driving a quarter mile to the bank to cash a small check -_- 
Thinking about just leaving ... 
My house now has the ONE thing I hate most of all about computers ... A webcam ... these things are SO creepy . Oh yes for those of you with them know this , they ARE hackable . Hence , creepyness . 
Finally off work for a few days but absolutely NOTHING to do . 
It seems the music selection for tonight is Bullet for My < PROPFIRST > the poison\ 
every song but tears dont fall :D 
I just witnessed 4 armed guards be brutally murdered with a broom -_- 
On second thought increase that number to 20 
Hm aprox 8 hours until next year .... time to come up with a resolution . 
The sky is really nice tonight o_O 
I believe there a very few things in this world more beautiful than a clear night sky . 
... \ 
They say I'm just a stupid kid , just a crazy radical ... \ 
... Another generation X who somehow slipped up through the crack\ 
Oh , they'd love to see me fall but I'm already on my back\ 
So it goes in one ear and right out the other\ 
People talkin ' shit but you know I never bother\ 
It goes to one ear and right out the other\ 
People talkin ' shit , they can kiss the back of my hand ... 
How odd that i sorta expect some sorta negative reaction from that song post . 
Mind in a thick haze\ 
The heart is torn asunder\ 
Now sleep will not come\ 
ah haikus \ 
something to think whenever you can't sleep . 
Wallowing within the depths of ones own mind to find a way to move on . 
So who thinks school will be out tomorrow ? 
Why do the good die young and the wicked live happily ... 
I would just like to say , I hate my friend < PROPMALE > for giving me a new addiction . Damn you minecraft ! 
Well ive learned 2 things\ 
that no matter how much you fight yourself or try to trick yourself you will never win\ 
and that music and chess are a weird combo . 
\We like people for their qualities 
Woo 1 more day out !!!!!! >.> sarcasm ~ 
Feeling sick -_- 
Amazing how 3 hours of work can help clear ones mind so much . 
Giving up for the final time . 
Presented on a silver platter , greedily taken , carelessly thrown away . 
Best worse day of my life leading into an increasingly better day today ... Yeah .. Its been a good one :D 
In love , in doubt , indoubtly in love ? 
Omgfml they are making a < PROPFIRST > bieber movie -facepalm- 
Amazing how emotional bliss can turn to unrelenting confliction . 
Well atleast this guy will be able to get away from all facebook drama for 3 days . To bad its at the expense of being bored . -.- 
Something to think about . \ 
Is there a difference between honesty and the truth ? 
Almost time to go home x.X 
Your heavens trying everything , your heavens trying everything to bring me down . 
Why do people add everyone they know to their friends ? Why should they care what the random guy down the street has to say about his flowers -_- 
Wow my neighbors are idiots . Little kids just randomly running around in our yard >.> \ 
where are my rocks at ...... 
Downloading 130+ songs at once .... I forsee a computer dying soon . 
2 best shows ever , shameless and skins . 
Just out of curiosity , has anyone ever seen the ORIGINAL skins ? ( Not the MTV version ) 
After 4 hours the music has finally downloaded with 0 viruses :D 
Found my new favorite quote today in a math class . \ 
\Untill you make peace with who you are 
Shake me down , not a lot of people left around , who knows now , softly laying on the ground ~~~ 
Lol springer's facebook got banned by a facebook failbot >.> 
Im not < PROPFIRST > bieber -_- 
No matter how much i say i hate working , i gotta say that i do really enjoy my job , its the people that make it enjoyable ( people = coworkers not customers ) 
Something to think about .... If you were a tool , what kind would you be ? 
Its been a good night ..... Nothing truly or realistically accomplished but still good nonetheless . 
Everyone looking forward to singles awareness day monday ? 
Sometimes life is funny in its own little ways 
Reality must be nice to not have to live in . 
Everyone looking forward to singles awareness day tommorow ? 
Happy singles awareness day to any and everyone that can and will be participating !!! 
Sigh ..... Dont want to sleep .... So sick of nightmares ..... 
This is a message to everyone\ 
< PROPMALE > JUST MADE ME LOSE THE GAME !!! 
Best thing ever heard from Skins\ 
what's every bastard that's ever lived had in common ? \ 
His father is a bastard that never broke the cycle . \ 
amazing . 
Just about getting time to clear out the ole friends list . Why have people I would never talk to eh ? 
I am so sick of my dads with his pissy ass girlfriend who always has this disgusted look on her face when im around . -_- 
Woo friday nights with nothing to do because adolf hitdad will get mad if i want to socialize 
Wouldn't it be amazing to just live outside the city in a house with a clear roof and just to be able to see all the stars ? 
Woo entertaining day\ 
btw mongolia grill is AWESOME !!! 
Woo bowling and sucking at it 
Fun night with people lol\ 
got owned at bowling too lol 
Just gotta love hostility at home . 
Hm i wonder if anyone can really answer this question : what IS fire . 
Hypocrisy is the language of liers . 
Woo workin all night x.X 
Hm even tho it was a monday and worked all after school , it was , i dare say , a very good day . 
2 naps in school so far x.X 
Ah , finally deleted some ppl and cleared up the the wall . 
It has been a pretty good night . 
Only have to go to school for maybe an hour tommorow then out all Friday woot ! 
Wanting to sleep but to also stay up all night . 
Well ..... That was annoying . 
IDC if its 1 in the morning ... Feeling great and it's already looking to be a good day . 
Amazing how a great day can turn terrible . Side note , if you find yourself to be a pissy person after church not only are you a fake but you shouldnt take it out on the people who have to put up with your s *** and you should just go home and think about what a fake you are . Now im done raging . 
Wow trade school sucked . 
Empires built around your heart , let the right one in ... 
I need therapy -_- 
I want to leave ... 
Why do the worst things happen to the best people ? 
Lalalalala boredom 
Well i quit mabi\ 
anyone who really knows me knows what that means . 
Hit . Hit . Hit . Hit . Bust . Fold . 
Done . 
I think im going to end up having to drop to a standard diploma and goto summer school if not drop out all together -_- 
\There's someone for everyone\ " -facepalm- -facepalm- -facepalm- small amount of advice to people\ 
I swear if my dad did what i think he did im going to kill him . 
Boredom on a monday x.X 
Just heard something that just made me lmfao 
Tough titty said the < PROPFEMALE > but the milks still good 
Very great start to a weekend 
What to do what to do x.X 
What is it about life that's so depressing ..... 
How much longer to disappear ... 
Having second thoughts -_- 
Hm 16 years and ive only met 2 people who aren't fake . 
Life is like a chilled spring day . Most people are cold but stay content with it . But deep down everyone wants a greater warmth . Sadly enough though , it seems like those people that think they've found the warmth they've so desperately seeked just get burned by it . So if your one of the people who has found that perfect warmth try to keep it as long as you can and never let it go . 
Insincerity was the best band tonight hands down 
Half drunk rednecks make me wanna rofl . \ 
\you looking at me funny ? \ " \ 
Has anyone else noticed that if you have an awesome friday the rest of the weekend is boring ? 
Oh boy school tommorow\ 
Hmm ...... Prom is this week ... 
Never a dull moment with a bunch of overemotional hormonal teenagers -_- 
Wow everyone is so disgustingly tan now\ 
so fake looking . 
To know everyone's given up on you is a huge relief but also an emotional burden ... 
Floating down the river of lonely to drown in a sea of regret ... 
I swear the teachers here are idiots and can't even make a study guide right 
Man im a sucker for pretty eyes lol 
Prom was pretty good\ 
better than i thought lol 
Bleh another weekend gone 
My dog just found a knife and brought it to us lol 
Everyone's got friends friends friends friends 
Just another year in this forsaken hell hole till i can leave -.-
