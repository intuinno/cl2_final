Will not give up . Play me for a fool , but I will not crumble :) I am strong .

Addicted to Gaia Online and Deviant < PROPMALE > ALL over again . Hmm . 
I don't appreciate people throwing their religion on to me as if it were a tainted pair of underwear . I don't need God in my life , and if you can't respect that , then I don't need you in my life either . Respect my views as I do yours . 
The worst pain comes from family ; You never forget , and forgiving a repeated offense , eventually drives you to indecision . The outcome seems far too grim . 
I don't know how to help her ; She is set on hurting herself , no matter the consequences . And I don't think she cares how much this will affect her family .
