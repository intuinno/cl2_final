Awake for 41 hours , slept for 7 , and then back in action

Since my Xbox is mostly dead now , I'll probably be playing Diablo 2 . xD . I might be on AIM more often as well . Come talk to me .

It's weird how when you bake stuff it never comes out the same way twice ... 
There are three choices for me for tomorrow : < PROPFIRST > Lennon ( not really lol ) , < PROPMALE > Morrison ( feasible ) or just wear a band shirt . 
Today is Be Nice to My Little Sister Day . Going to the mall ... 
Do I even look like a music legend ? Some guy I talked to on the city bus said I look like < PROPMALE > Morrison of The Doors but that's it . 
Heh . Sanity ? Sorry , I don't recall ever having anything like that . 
Good luck on the skit , sorry I'm not coming 
Oops , my bad < PROPMALE > . You should probably remember to ask me for stuff back ... lol 
I shouldn't be allowed this much time to do nothing but think about my life . It depresses me far more than you can imagine . ( Probably ) 
can't wait for SATurday ... 
Okay . The next 4 years or so of my life depend on this SATurday . And if I recall correctly , I can send my score to 4 colleges . Which should I send them to ? 
Okay . I'll fucking post it again . The next 4 years or so of my life depend on this SATurday . And if I recall correctly , I can send my score to 4 colleges . Which should I send them to ? By the way : I'm interested in Engineering ( all types ) , Physics , Chemistry , and ( yes ) even History .

can't login to any of the college websites that I'm hoping to be accepted into . Nothing works . This is the kind of fucking bullshit that happens to me :( 
How are we supposed to do the Japanese homework ; what address do we send it to ? I normally would just skip it but schoolloop says it's worth 100pts .. 
Nulla è reale , tutto è lecito . 
can't remember who said they had Bioshock . Does someone want to lend me that ? It'll get a few people off my back xD 
Bioshock = Easily one of the greatest games ever made . 
hopes nobody actually falls for this Blackbelt Profit System scam . It's pretty damn obvious . 
Ugh ; my glasses are wearing out . Son of a ... 
' Cause we hunt you down without mercy ; hunt you down all nightmare long 
Mass Effect 2 = GODLY . Thank you < PROPMALE > Falsetti . Goodnight , ladies and gentlemen !

Last day of XBL , better take advantage of it .. 
Not looking forward to anything this week , now that I think about it . Looking forward to ... nothing ? 
Then snow stars falling in paradise , as he gazes at the stars . He will be born again in the sky , when the night turns into < PROPFEMALE > . 
Aiming to get a better night of sleep . ' Night . 
So bored . :/ 
It's ? Day . Go eat some pie . 
Sadface :( 
I guess I don't have to even wake up until like 10 tomorrow . 
Enchantment of the fire and < PROPFEMALE > , lost in the whispering night . The < PROPFEMALE>'s magic enthralls the woods , crawling in the sweet starlight . 
:) 
Gonna be a good day . :] Although if Wednesday was a sign I might run out quick ... 
Is anybody doing anything today ? 
Nothing to do . As usual . 
:] 
BioShock 2 is fucking awesome . No lie . 
Feeling ... cynical , I guess . :/ 
This time was not made for me ; I have nowhere to land , no place to rest . Like a bird , without a nest ; I'm gliding , under the clouds , forevermore 
Awesomeness was had today , gentlemen . Fuck yeah . 
\It's not rape if you yell ' surprise ' or ' happy birthday'\ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Venables "

Painnnn .. :( 
Anybody have a pair of crutches laying around ? It seems that I don't have any and I could really use some . 
Could somebody drive me to school tomorrow ? I'd really rather not take the bus ... 
Every time something like this happens , I try and think to myself : \Don't worry . It could be worse . \"" 
Just got back from my appointment . I have a severe ankle sprain , tearing all three ligaments . At least it isn't broken :/ 
Go ahead and join if you think Lady Gaga looks like a Splicer from Bioshock because it's true . 
Just ate 3 grilled cheese sandwiches and a quesadilla . Midnight cheese craze = one of the awesomest meals ever eaten . 
Walked without crutch for a while today . Big mistake , now paying for it :( 
May the Fourth be with you tomorrow . 
Never tell me the odds . 
I see the life , I see the sky ; give it all to see you fly 
I just wanna , be the leader ; ready to win you , forever . At full speed , step on the gas , tonight ; it's alright ! GOT THE FIRE OF THE GRAND PRIX ! Grippin ' my steering wheel so tight ; GONNA BE A LUCKY GRAND PRIX ! Ready to cross the line in the end !

Having a great birthday so far :] 
-_- For my 18th birthday , my step-dad went all the way to Fremont to get something . A new leather jacket for himself . Oh wait , he got me a < PROPFEMALE > bar with a post-it note on it . It's not even king-size . FML 
If somebody picks this up for me I'll love them forever . I'll pay you back for it <3 http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/vgm/1770825461.html 
Well , at least it's not as bad as my 13th birthday which made me not want to celebrate my birthday ever again ... 
Bought cigarettes for my dad . Felt weird .. 
Will you , take me out of there - when I'm staring down the barrel , when I'm blinded by the light , when I cannot see your face ; take me out of here ~ 
XBOX 360 ELITE GET !!!!! <3 < PROPFIRST > L Schroeder <3

Officially done with high school classes , got Red Dead Redemption ; good day .

Sister's 8th grade graduation at 1 , my graduation at 6 
Off to take another landmark step in the timeline of my life 
Ah , summer . The time when I have nothing to do and over half of my friends forget that I exist . Love it .

PSP re-modded and ready to go . 
Getting electricity shut off from 9am-3pm . GG . 
I just stepped on a screw . Barefoot . Lemme give you a hint into the pain : I had to pull it out . 
Probably the best 4th of July ever for me . :) Except for fucking up my foot like this :/ 
Only got a 4 on AP Physics :/ 
Don't know what to do ... 
Just finished watching season one of Scrubs :] 
In a trail of fire , I know we will be free again . In the end we will be one . In a trail of fire , I'll burn before you bury me . Set your sights for the sunnnnn 
needs a miracle to occur in the next 48 hours or else I'm fucked . 
baked up some delicious cookies :] . Haven't baked in a while ... 
Had like the awesomest dream of my life . I was Sulu and I was grappling to helicopters but that's all I can remember lol 
While you are letting your guard down , I will be letting myself go . While you keep running your ship aground , I will be setting myself alight . 
Walked home from < PROPFIRST>'s house . Tired . Time to kill people . 
SJSU orientation tomorrow 
SJSU opened 30 extra sections just for our orientation session . Got my classes set :D 
Anyone know when we get our FAFSA money ? 
Anger . 
I am deep in a river , waves above my head . Held with no spirit , we descend ; we reach the end . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Venables started school ... Now who am I gonna talk to all day ? :( 
He who laughs last is laughing at you . 
Weird as hell dream . But I liked it :D 
We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution . You exist because we allow it , and you will end because we demand it . 
got another new kitten . This brings the cat count to 6 . 
What the fuck ! I still don't have my financial aid and the disbursement date was a week ago ! 
Just finished my 3-page paper for Science 2 . To tell the truth , I'm surprised I did it , lol . 
Got new contacts , starting school today . Kickin ' my ass in gear . 
If I have to actually take this shitty precalc class , I'm going to kill myslef , chop myself into pieces and throw myself in the garbage . 
Yeah , I'm one of the many with no classes on Friday . Yeeah :D 
Got a Wii and Monster < PROPMALE > Tri ! 
Sometimes I want to copy someone else's status word for word just to see if they will notice . 
First college paper , I think I did pretty good . 
My English professor wrote \Motherfucker\ " on the board today while talking to us about using descriptive language . " 
I hate Amazon . Ebay is the only way to go . On the somewhat bright side , I have a credit card now . I may not have gotten it intentionally , but oh well ; might as well use it . 
Gone . 
Back . 
If you live , you will die ; you won't live forever stuck in time . Ebb and flow , push and tow ; you must keep it real to find her . 
Moving into my dorm tonight O_o Didn't know I had to do it so soon .. 
So , uh ... I apparently need a cell phone . Someone wanna help me shop for one this weekend ?

I'm indestructible ; determination that is incorruptible . From the other side , a terror to behold . Annihilation will be unavoidable . 
Holy crap , Vindictus looks awesome . I wish I could play it T_T 
Reach time ? I think so . 
Somebody in the Dining Commons said I looked like somebody from The Office , but I forgot the name he said .

Like my status & I'll tell you : 1 . Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . The color you remind me of . 3 . My first memory of you . 4 . The animal you remind me of ... 5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 . My favorite thing about you . 7 . Give you a weird nickname . 8 . Challenge you to post this 
Newest psytrance that I like = Ananda Shake . So good . 
Looked at my Facebook wall all the way back to October of last year . I am a very depressing person . I also saw a few people who I owe my life to , in a way . You know who you are , even though one of them is in the US Army . Thank you . 
You need people like me . You need people like me so that you can point your finger and say , \That's the bad guy . \""

If I started making puzzles ( not sure if there is a better word ) would people try and solve them ? I am picking up and interest in cryptology .
