I like nonsense -- it wakes up the brain cells . Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living . It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope ... and that enables you to laugh at all of life's realities . 
thanks to everyone for wishing me a happy bday . and < PROPFIRST > WU HAPPY BDAY TO YOU TOO xD

< PROPFIRST > fucked up . Im more blonde <.< 
Every person has a photographic memory , some are just out of film . 
Someone lied to ruin someone's life today . Hope they're happy and the people that helped better be just as pleased . 
i miss when things could just be blown away like when we were younger . life was easy then and nothing was a big deal and a little lie didn't mean anything more than a little lie . but now that we're adults a little lie can spread like wild fire and destroy everything in it's path and destroy the lives ahead of it . 
i haven't been this mad in a while . someone says one thing wrong to me i will punch them in the face no questions asked . 
Going to the dentist at 11 D:

Well ... work is ... work . 
Well , it's time for classes again ; and yet again , I am in Gen Cell Bio ... FML . 
one bad hair day coming right up ! 
oh .. so lame . classes before 9:30 are cancelled -.- shoulda taken that 9am lab >.< 
my bio lab prof is an ass .... he emailed us at 12:30 to let us know that lab was cancelled .... WHY NOT before ?? why not before noon ? i checked at NOON ! >.< ugh 
With tear streaked eyes I fall to sleep .... 
just hit me with the whole damn hurricane now and get it over with . I'm sick of the steady flow of heavy down pouring . 
the only person you can believe when they say \i love you\ " is your mom ; she won't go breaking your heart . " 
I love my big sissy cuz she just made my day (: 
well there's a first for everything ... whoda thought sittin in a parking lot is a bad thing ? well apparently certain cops ... <.< 
Is about to destroy her laptop . Def not worth what I paid for it ... 
at what point do you assume your bf doesn't want to date you anymore ? when he doesn't talk to you ? or see you ? i'm a little confused ... 
i went through all the pics i was tagged in and it felt like i was going back in time ... lots of diff stuff happened and wow how i've changed ... 
went and got my nails did and it was a good depression reliever . altho was an expensive one , but < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Coffey needed it as well . 
i can go through the day and pretty much not think , by keeping my mind occupied and busy . but when night rolls around and there's nothing but my thoughts and no texts to read ... my mind remains on a single strand of \what if \"" 
if you're important to someone they will try to keep you in their lives ... if they don't; move on , don't waste your tie on someone who doesn't truly care . 
well ... i figured it was over .. but didnt think it'd hurt this bad ... and why lie to me before you do it ? you said your phone was on , but why didnt you call or text ? you said you messaged me , why didnt i receive any ? 
he doesnt want it to be over .. now im confused ... 
no one can say im a bad driver anymore ! i was driving and < PROPFIRST>'s tire blew up ! and i didnt even hit nothing :D or wreck technically ! <.< so i officially am a good driver (:

doesn't just want a < PROPFIRST > . she wants someone who will make her smile , hold her tight , and who just wants to be with her ... everyday . 
Welcome , I'm the doormat . Just wipe your crap on me then move on . Oh , my feelings ? Oh don't worry , just trample all over those too ... Everyone else does ... 
My life was a fairytale , the best it could be , but it came falling down ; for all to see . the joy i knew .. was infinitely high , but now i feel it is no longer alive . i weep now for my broken heart , with despairing hope that my life is going to restart . Hoping now .. that ... my fairytale life i've constructed , will be as if you'd never touched it . 
Thoughts are on the person who carried me 9 months , kissed me , fed me , cared for me when I was sick and my dreams are her dreams . That's my MOMMY and I MISS HER . 
i went to mcdonald's for dinner . ordered a coke with it cuz well haven't had coke in while .. didnt taste it til i got back to my room . well when i did boy was i surprise . it was dr pepper >.< stupid tards <.< i hate dr pepper D:
