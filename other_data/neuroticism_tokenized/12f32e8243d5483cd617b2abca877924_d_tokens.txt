just waiting 

goin to church today for the first time in a long time . At least it's not baptist ;) 
I got asked to learn from a dance instructor tonight ... so that I could help teach classes this October !! Woo Hoo !!! 
people people people ... suck suck suck ... just don't get it 
just spent about 7 hours studying baptism ... It's a good study ; you should try it ! P.S. Judgmental = not ok 
Lol what is with all these people complaining about having another day ? Don't we know when our days are over we're gonna wish we had lived each of them to the fullest ? 
Please pray for my friend < PROPFIRST > . He was supposed to be able to come home today and ended up in a bad situation . Just pray for his safety . Thanks ! 
Here's another shout out of a prayer request ... My friend < PROPFIRST > is in both a spiritual and court battle for his life , eternal and physical . I'm not the strongest christian , but I'm working on it and I'm really praying that through this somehow < PROPFIRST > can come to Christ . I love him so dearly and am asking for prayer both that the court's decision is not too severe and that God will open his eyes to the truth . Thank you =) 
If there's 1 thing I don't get , it's y people don't get it . Being a Christian doesn't suddenly make us better than every1 else ... a prostitute , whore , murderer , rapist , cheater , woman beater ... it just means that we've fallen on our faces b4 God & pleaded His mercy & forgiveness . We're still sinners . Y look down on or treat somebody like an outcast when if it weren't for God taking pity on us , we'd be in the same exact position ? 
Abigale !!!! I love you !!!! 
Midnight escapes aren't always perfect !!! lol But they're still fun ... Thanks , God 
PS . BIG HUGE PRAISE !!! All charges on my friend are being dismissed and once papers and a couple other things are done he can come back home !!! SOOO excited !!!! Thank you for praying 
Woo hoo !!!!! < PROPFIRST > is back !!!!! We picked him up from the airport the night before last ... Thanks again for praying =) He's got quite a bit to do still 
Thank you God 
Yay !! It's my birthday !! Thank you , mom ! lol And I guess dad . Ha . lol 
loves that I can listen to my myspace playlists even when I'm on facebook ! 
OK so , I was just trying to send this out via cell phone when , of course , it locked up . SOOOO ... If you woke up in a jail cell with me ... in 4 words ... what would you say ? 
Thinks I possibly may have been aproached by swingers tonight ( shudders ) 
So I went to < PROPMALE>'s tonight and he had decorated the room with Christmas lights . He also had bought us Christmas stockings and filled mine with presents and a card I can't open til Christmas =)

So I was reading through my text inbox from a year ago . It's amazing how things have changed . Several texts talked about how much I hated my life&wanted to die . Jared&I were not talking(now we're engaged ) , I was abnormally anti-social . I was miserable . God turned my life around the minute I let him . Course , there was also a text saying < PROPFEMALE > wanted to know if < PROPMALE > Dilliard was < PROPFEMALE > Jolien . But anyway , THANK YOU GOD ! 
Just got done playing ddr with my sister .. Goodnight ! 
ugh ... . 
My babes is so sweet =) 
Ok . So . Invites should have been sent already . Fiance was gone for the weekend , which is fine , except now that I finally have an idea of what pictures to use , I just spent ALL day ( 6 hours ) trying to add a border and text and can't do it .

Just finished watchin my first birthday video . Had a crush on my Uncle < PROPFIRST > Baker , was taught how to feed a baby by my Aunt < PROPFEMALE > Baker , had a beautiful birthday hat made by my mom < PROPFEMALE > Baker , crawled in a box with my brother < PROPMALE > Baker , and fought for a doll with my cousin < PROPFEMALE > Flett ... How I miss that music box ! =) 
So proud of < PROPMALE > ... He voluntarily threw away THIRTY-FOUR movies this weekend !! I added in one of them and a cd = 35 cds total . When we told < PROPFEMALE > about it , she said that's sad . < PROPMALE > said yep . She said , \I don't mean it's sad you threw them away ; I mean it's sad you had them . \"" 
Happy Anniversary , Hunny !! =)

Love lets the other win ... Hmm . That's a tough one lol 
Where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . Out of the mouth come the words of the heart . Whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap ... I'm going to start paying attention to my words/conversations . The Lord deserves first place in my life . He is completely loving and wonderful . My best friend , my Saviour , my God ... 
I think I may be under spiritual attack . If anyone would pray for me I'd appreciate it 
Hello , all ... Just want to let everyone know that my cell phone is and has been mia =) I'm not ignoring your texts

Going to sleep ... =) Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , for praying for me , and < PROPMALE > Christian for tucking me in ... I love you guys
