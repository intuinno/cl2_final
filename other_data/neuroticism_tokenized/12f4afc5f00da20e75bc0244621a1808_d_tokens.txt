I love to watch the light spread to the room , see how it dances from you to me to you . with our laughter , bright white sound I'll build a castle that won't fall down :] 
if i loose everything in the fire , im sending all my love to you . 
im gone . work & then school . byebye . 
forebidden to remember . terrified to forget . 
one of these days i'll show up to work on time .... that day isnt gonna be today . =]

sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same .. =/ 
take me home to my heart . let me go and i will run . ~ trading yesterday . 
regardless of warnings . the future doesnt scare me at all :]

i tried to be perfect , it just wasnt worth it . nothing could ever be so wrong . its hard to believe me , it never get easy . i guess i knew that all along .. ~ sum41 <3 
i was told you are depressed by a little bird that was severly hurt as it did not notice my window , it just flew wherever the wind blows . as it convuled on the pavement , it whispered i am hated .. 
i am drenched :D 
p.s. 12 memories <3 :] 
ive got a bad feeling about this =/ 
smother me <3 
there's one thing i can do nothing about .. 
and the punch line to the joke is asking someone save us . heavenn help us now , come crashing down . we'll hear the sound , as you're falling down . ~ mcr <3 
owiee !! i broke my toe D:< 
sleep with your head against the sky tonight , i cant count how many times you've made me cry . 
adrift on your ocean floor i feel weightless , numb , and sore .. 
every grain of sand that you < PROPFIRST > me pictures in , there was one for every time that my heart dropped again . (: <3 
Cause just one sip would make me sick . I used to be love drunk but now I’m hungover . I'll love you forever but now I'm sober . (= 
sinking down upon dirty ground my heart has stopped inside of me . break my legs to hold me to you ; sulfur breathed into my head . 
im freezing o_o 
' cause it's messy . yes , this mess is minee :] 
i'm in my room its a typical tuesday night . i'm listening to the kind of music she does'nt like . she'll never know your story like i do . (: <3

i hope i never wake up . i dream about you all the time now .. 
time to go take finals !! :D AGH ! >___> 
every drawing that i < PROPFIRST > was never as cute as you . =[ 
11:11 ? 
if we could take the time to lay it on the line , i could rest my head just knowing that you were mine . 
you swore that you never would leave me baby , whatever happened to you ? O.o 
there's a lull in the stereo and it's calling for you . <3 
\failure is simply the start of a more failiures to come . \ " ~ ROFLMFAO ! YIPPIE !! :D last day of school !! WOOT ! :D " 
i've seen your flag on the marble arch , love is not a victory march , it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah . 
love may wash away the blues , but i still aint over you . </3 
2 more wks till school starts . > < 
my heart was caught in a landslide and now it feels for you onlyy . (: <3 
last day at work today =(

The months , they don't matter it's the days I can't take when the hours move to minutes and i'm seconds away . 
dear did you know , you're all that i wish for ? (: <3 
and you know that until the stars fall , i'll always love you . 
love is blind .

what would you think if i sang out of tune ? would you stand up and walk out on me ? lend me your ears , and i'll sing you a song and i'll try not to sing out of key . oh , i get by with a little help from my friends . :] <3 
my love affair with everywhere was innocent why do you care ? ~ wet sand . 
with a child's heart , you've got no reason to frown . love is as welcome as a < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > day with no grown up thoughts to lead our hearts astray . :] 
and it breaks her heart to know her love is given only , to a man with hands as cold as ice . 
call this a mask , call me strong ; call me a mess , call me wrong . ' cause sick hearts do fine , with wasting their time ...

when i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind ; he broke his own heart and i watched as he tried to reassemble it . and my mama swore that she would never let herself forget . and that was the day that i promised i'd never sing of love if it does not exist .
