Yeah , I don't agree at all 
PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this . 
For all those back home : yes we are ok in Okinawa , the earthquake etc . Didn't affect us 
For those of you in the states who keep asking me for it , you can text me at this number : 813-438-4808 . No , you can't call it , but this number texts an app on my iPhone so I'll always have it on me if I have service . My house phone is frequently disconnected , hence why I don't give that number out .
