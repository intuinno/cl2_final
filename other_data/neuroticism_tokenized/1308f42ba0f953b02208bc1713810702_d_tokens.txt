A new day .... 
OK back to real work LOL ... 
OK so I uploaded the puppu playgroup vidio with a new sounfd track . It should be here soon . Enough for one night . 
A new day , new adventures to take . Life is wonderful , I hope everyone enjoys their day 
A new day , new challages . With a little help from my friends , we will get through the day ... 
here a quote to ponder : “Give , and it shall be given to you . For whatever measure you deal out to others , it will be dealt to you in return . ” 
Here is a thought for today : The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance , the wise grows it under his feet . - < PROPFIRST > Oppenheim 
The happiness of life is made up of minute fractions—the little soon-forgotten charities of a kiss , a smile , a kind look , a heartfelt compliment in the disguise of a playful raillery , and the countless other infinitessimals of pleasurable thought and genial feeling . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Coleridge 
Making a decision to have a child-it's momentous . It is to decide forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body . -- < PROPFEMALE > Stone 
As I start this new day , This quote seems to ring true . The first step in the acquisition of wisdom is silence , the second listening , the third memory , the fourth practice , the fifth teaching others . < PROPMALE > Ibn Gabriol 
Here is a thought for today : God doesn't require us to succeed ; he only requires that you try . -- Mother < PROPFEMALE > 
Make the most of yourself , for that is all there is of you . -- < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Here is a thought : Happiness is not having what you want , but wanting what you have . - Anonymous 
Here is a thought to ponder .. \Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night . \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe " 
Here is a good thought while I have 4 dogs in a play group ... Nobody motivates today's workers . If it doesn't come from within , it doesn't come . Fun helps remove the barriers that allow people to motivate themselves . -- < PROPMALE > Cain 
Here is a thought to ponder ... And above all things have fervent love for one another , for \love will cover a multitude of sins . \ " 1 < PROPFIRST > 4:8 " 
Here is a thought for the day : \To improve is to change ; to be perfect is to change often . \ " < PROPMALE > Churchill " 
Today < PROPFEMALE > the Wicked Good Dog Store puppy died . SHe was hit by a truck and died in her mother's arms . I am sure she is waiting at the Rainbow bridge . < PROPFEMALE > spent many hours with me teaching other dogs to play . She was the only one who could beat Big < PROPMALE > the bulldog . We will miss her . 
Here is a thought .... Were it offered to my choice , I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning , only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults in the first . ---- < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Here a thought to ponder : Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air , is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies . < PROPMALE > Fromm 
It's a bright new day to go walking with the dogs and be thankful for all we have . SO here is a thought , \The entire sum of existence is the magic of being needed by just one other person . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Putnam "

REALLY ??... Feel free to copy and paste if you agree !
