Never frown when you are sad . You never know whos falling in love with your smile <3 
I feel exactly the same way ;) 
Youve seen all my light , and you love my dark :) 
A kiss is a lovely trick , designed by nature , to stop words when speech becomes superfluous <3 
Im supposed to be scared , but for sum reason im not ... I trust you . Now you have everything <3 
Damn ... What a day 
Stop chasing shadows just enjoy the ride 
Theres one sad truth ive found while journeying east and west . The only folks we really wound are those we love the best . We flatter those we scarcely know , we please the fleeting guest , and deal many a thoughtless blow to those who love us best <3 im sry :( 
At least today seems like its going by fast :P 
Work for an hour ... Lame -.- 
Supervillans at jacks :P 
Sumtimes you have to make a mistake to push sumthing you care about further ;) 
Well ... Its nearly 4am and i am yet to even feel tired :/ today is gonna suck ... Sigh/lol 
Dont you love it when you wake up sporadically around 4:30 am and theres nothing to do , and yet , you cant fall back asleep ? 
When ur day goes as shitty as mine is , it can only get better ... Right ? :/ 
My walls come crashing down ...
