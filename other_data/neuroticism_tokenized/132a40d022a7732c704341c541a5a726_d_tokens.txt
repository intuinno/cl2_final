Holding on to your guilt over past transgressions is not being humble . These transgressions were wiped clean as though never committed when you became a child of God . Don't empower them by dwelling on them . It's good to have a testimony , but don't live in your testimony . -- Just found this interesting tonight at Bible study -- 
lots of fun at Dad's today ..... < PROPFIRST > played so much cornhole that the right side of his back and his right leg is aching - the boy is addicted

Why don't people trust God anymore ? We trust those we know . We know those we have a relationship with . We have a relationship with those we fellowship with . - Sis < PROPFEMALE > Tennyson

OMG is it hurting !!! Apparently this stuff is on the nerve root and causes the whole muscle to ache ...... Come on Vicodin - kick in !!

And .. the job is only about 25 mins away ! 
How blessed am I ??? Thank you all so much for your prayers . I received a phone call at 9:30 this morning asking me to call the GM of the HVAC company ... I talked to him less than 5 minutes on the phone and now have a formal interview in the morning at 9am !! Thank you all for your prayers and well wishes . Now , with the continued help of God , I will nail this interview in the morning and have a job tmrw !!

Harvest Hoe-Down at church t'nite .... lots of fun and the girls each brought home a 2 lb bag of < PROPFEMALE > 
< PROPFEMALE > won a $25 Wal-mart gift card at the Boys & Girls Club today for making the best Holiday card !! I'm quite proud of her ! 
Lots to do tonight and all I wanna do is sleep ... 
Frustration at it's highest .... B's first night in the main sanctuary - total disaster - couldn't get her to quit talking ( or the other kids for that matter)- crayon < PROPFIRST > on the seat of the pew - multiple trips out for potty , crying , etc . - and to top it all off , she pees her pants and i had no extra clothes - needless to say , i have no clue what the pastor spoke on tonight ( the people around me prbly don't either ) 
A lil ' bit of braggin on < PROPFEMALE > ... I told about her winning a $25 gift card for making the best holiday card - what I didn't realize , until yesterday , was that the Boys & Girls Club here in < PROPMALE > chose her card to have printed and use as their holiday cards to their supporters - I got a copy yesterday and < PROPFEMALE > will scan it next time I'm over there ... needless to say , i'm even more proud than i was :-D 
off work today - they're cutting back hours until we get a cold snap and service calls increase so , i'm only working 4 days a week now - i kinda like having a mid-week day off though - quiet house , time to myself ( before B is up ) aaaahhhhh , refreshing :-) 
So , how do you deal with a boss who wants to talk to people like they are complete idiots ? I had my first taste of it today . Apparently 3 weeks into the job , I'm suppose to remember every single thing every single day without fail or perhaps he should \laminate a timeblock schedule to my desk so I won't forget what needs to be filled\ " ggggrrrrr Do you know what the Carlisle in me wanted to do ? " 
thinkin bout hittin a couple flea markets tmrw - haven't done that in a while 
Stayed home frm church with B this morning - she's got a sick tummy :-( 
Really enjoyed studying < PROPFIRST > over the last few weeks - our pastor's wife did an excellent job - for such a short book in the Bible it is chock-full of guidance 
watching Miracle on 34th Street ( the original ) with Liv & B - one of my favorite movies ... :-) 
Thanksgiving : What is it ? Expressing gratitude/appreciation - How often should we give thanks ? In all circumstance ; you don't have to thank God for a trial , but thank God for who he is in the midst of the trial because God is bigger than your circumstance ( jus a small part of this morning's sermon - it was a good one !! ) 
HAPPY THANKSGIVING ALL Y'ALL 
My latest favorite quote : \Poverty is under-rated . It builds character and a sense of humor . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > McMinn " 
feelin pretty icky but i'm hopin it's jus a reaction to the cigarette smoke at mom's all day yesterday - i so do not want it to be a cold ... :-( 
hasn't been feeling very well for a few days now and it's not the cigarette smoke from Mom's or a cold ... been feeling extremely lethargic - not tired or sleepy but definitely lethargic - and can't seem to pull myself together right now - guessin i prbly oughta go see the doc 
oh the sickness .... < PROPFEMALE > puking yesterday , < PROPMALE > puking today ..... i really hope no one else kicks in tmrw

We've been watching < PROPFIRST > Bevere's series on \Breaking Intimidation\ " on DVD the last two Wednesday nights at church - it's been really eye-opening - can't wait to get the book " 
Faith should be based on the INTEGRITY OF GOD ; not on our experiences ----- < PROPFIRST > Bevere ( I love this !!! ) 
zombiefied .... yep , that's how i feel , whether it's a real word or not 
prayer for my mom - she had an aortobifemoral bypass this past monday and is having lots of respiratory problems now - they moved her into critical care today after being out of ICU for 1 day and have put her on 50% oxygen w/ a machine that pushes the air into her lungs ; if this doesn't work , next step is intubation - also , i found out today she has COPD which is both emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis 
The shepherd never went after the rebellious sheep . The rebellious sheep knows exactly where he is . The shepherd went after the lost sheep . -- read my next post ..... 
To rebel against something , you have to have knowledge about it . The more we learn about God , the more powerful our spiritual lives become . Satan intimidates us into walking away from that knowledge and being \our own person\ " by rebelling against church . Rebellion is a false bravado to cover the spirit of intimidation that controls your life . " 
.... an entire week away from Facebook and I can't think of anything I really want to say ... hhmm ... pathetic ... 
woohoo !!!! i am back among the living !!!! got my cable/internet hooked up today .... finally 
Isn’t He Wonderful Wonderful , Wonderful Isn’t Jesus My Lord Wonderful Eyes Have Seen , Ears Have Heard ‘Tis Recorded In God’s Word Isn’t Jesus My Lord Wonderful ~~~ the song in my mind today ~~~ 
okay ... i completely misspelled hallelujah every single time - lol - i just can't type as fast as i sing :-) 
so ... I get a day off work tmrw , only to come home and find my floor by the kitchen soaked ... not sure what . but something is leaking - i'm betting on the dishwasher - so now i have to spend the day here at home waiting for the maintenance guy to show up - LOVELY :-( 
well .... time to clean up the kitchen and head out for a few - need to work on the girls ' bedrm but jus not feelin it right now - i'd rather go look for an easter skirt for < PROPFEMALE > 
Motherhood does not equal popularity .... :-) 
my throat itches , my nose burns , my head hurts and i feel my sinuses draining ... oh yay ! my annual spring cold - joy , joy 
Livi's first softball game Tueday --- oh my , oh my .... this team is definitely not anywhere near ready ..... but it'll be fun anyway 
Game 1 done ... we lost 5-2 but it was a good game - Livi made a good play at first resulting in an out , beat out one of their girls to make it safe to third and hit a real solid line drive right up the middle .... i am proud of my girl !! Go Livi !! 
okay .... game 2 and i don't even care to tell the score .... our girls had trouble hitting - livi did get a good hit in toward the end of the game and she did an awesome job and showed some good hustle playing at shortstop and pitcher's helper 
..... desperately trying to stay awake ..... gotta pick < PROPMALE > up at the bus station at midnight -then i've gotta be at work at 8am .. oh yay me ! 
wooohooo - we came so close to winning tonight - our girls did awesome !! score was 11-7 - < PROPFEMALE > was 3 for 3 on batting , made a couple good plays at 1st base for outs - tonight was a big difference from game 1 
Off work tmrw so I get to have lunch with Livi at school - I might even manage to take an afternoon snack to Bryleigh's class if I can get enough done in the morning ** crossing my fingers ** 
where oh where has my motivation gone ? where oh where can it be ? i got laundry to do and a chore list that's long ... i need iced coffee from Micky D's \

........... yep ........... been that kind of wknd 
.... i have never seen a child so concerned with her legs being fat as < PROPFEMALE > is .... i think i finally got her to understand that her legs are muscular and that's okay ... i don't know where in the world it comes from but she thinks she needs to have rail-thin legs so she doesn't have any \baby-fat\ " on her " 
So ... < PROPFIRST > graduates tomorrow ... I'm happy for him , but really wanna hit the rewind button ... has anybody found it yet ? 
good day today - it was nice hangin out with friends and family - ended up staying long after everyone else left and just enjoying the day , even though it was horribly hot out 
aaahh ..... slept in today and then laid around in the bed watchin TV and playing with the girls ( they're so silly ) - I've seen a fashion show , the world's greatest dancer , had a < PROPMALE > invitation ( with a huge sweeping bow ) to the pizza picnic on Bryleigh's bed , a tickle contest and someone offered to share her < PROPFEMALE > with me if I'd watch cartoons with her ... it's been a wonderful day !! 
WOW !!! Thank you ... all of you . I've never gotten so many Happy Birthdays in my life . *** big cheesin smile going on ***

bryleigh has made it all day with no accidents - apparently she decided this morning she wanted to wear panties and has just done it .... i knew she was gonna jus up and decide she was ready one day - this girl is STUBBORN - should we place any guesses on whether this is Carlisle or Haltom stubborness :-)

gggrrrr ..... check engine light is back on .... this car and me is gonna fight !!! 
sciatic nerve really giving me fits tonight ... may end up taking a trip to the ER if this pain keeps shooting down my leg - it's like electric shocks keep hitting my lower back , wrapping around y hip and shooting straight down to my big toe ... been a while since i had a real bad episode with it

Proverbs 4:10 -11 - “Listen , my son , accept what I say , and the years of your life will be many . I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths . ” \

... is wondering if those facebook ads actually work .... might have to invest and find out 
... why do math sheets come home with the no explanation of how to do the work -- a number in a box with some random empty boxes drawn attaching to the first box ( or other empty boxes ) at random intervals with the instructions \solve\ " ---- like I remember doing this in school .... :-/ and why do i feel ignorant for having to look it up ? "

Why does the dog need to go out immediately after his bath and roll on the ground ???? Can he not wait until he's dry ? Oh well .... on to the next bath - B has a play date with Jaedyn to get cleaned up for :-) 
Come on SPRING !! Bought some flowers to plant ... Is it too early to plant bulbs ? Thinkin maybe I oughta wait a few more weeks .
