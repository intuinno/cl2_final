Had a great end to last year and a great beginning to this year :) 

I haven't gotten mad enough to almost start crying in a long time , but someone managed to make me that mad . But other than that our show went fine ! 
I didn't get the call back . But luckily not getting a call back doesn't mean you're not in the show at all . So I'm still hoping ! 
Winter Formal tomorrow ! Woo ! I get to go < PROPFEMALE > out with my friends on a WEEKEND ! Hahaha , it's rare . =) And for anyone wondering , I did not get a part in Honk !, but I'm gonna go watch it . Especially because alot of my friends that tried out are in it . =) 
winter formal was sooo fun ! =) I got mad at a puzzle for being so frustrating when we took a break haha 
Stop food spamming ! My gosh , this is getting ridiculous ! 
Can't wait til friday ! =) 
I lost my glasses at school ! T.T I hope I find them ... I sit in the back of most of my classes 
Done working finally ... must sleep now ... been working since 3 
Okay , I get up at six ( twenty , too lazy to get out of bed ) to get ready for school , then at seven we decide that I'm not even going because I'm sick . That was an hour I could've spent sleeping ! D= 
Sorry people ( < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and Kima ) , but there's no way that I can go to MORP 
is anyone up to go watch < PROPFEMALE > in wonderland tonight at 7 ? 
Cannible Hillbillies ! ( Just for < PROPFEMALE > , she'll get it ;D ) 
Didn't get into MT again . :,( . Well this time I only auditioned for Voice but still ... 
Certain people ( < PROPFEMALE > Barnes ) need to answer their phone so that I can tell them the change of plans ... or else let me know that one of my other tries have worked ! Or else she will end up at the wrong beach 
We played truth or dare during block 7 . Very entertaining . =) 
My 1 and a half year old sister is singing \Baby\ " ... does anyone see something wrong with that picture ? " 
Quiceanera practice was really fun ! =D 
Ooooh , since I was a broken replacement phone , I'm getting a newer model of the phone because mine was discontinued ! Upgrade yay ! =)

Just got my replacement phone today . Yessshhh . =) 
Honk was serious awesomeness !!!! =D Kinda wish I could see it again . Without mouthing the words to a lot of the songs . =P 
I wish people would ask beforehand if it's okay to come to my house to practice for something instead of just saying it the day of . =/ 
I love it when my friends come over ! It was so much fun ! =D 
Fashion show was so much fun ! :D 
The beach was really fun hanging out with my friends ! And now we're on summer vacation ! Yay =) \

Every 1 of 10 people born is gay , this means that they are instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , andso much else , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens areturning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't but let's see the 5% of you who will . 
Does anyone have Cross for chem ? If so , what was the book assignment ? It isn't on sharepoint 
Happy Birthday to the bestest mom in the whole world ! :D 
I have a costume for halloween now ! :D 
Had an ... interesting class today . Team building exercises are defnitely more entertaining when everyone's wrists are tied to each other's and you're trying to eat that way . 
Looks like < PROPFIRST > Hazzard and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > know exactly how to make me turn bright red ! :P 
Thanks to everyone who went to the Classical Voice show yesterday ! It was a lot of fun and everyone was amazing ! :D
