I got tickets to see the Twilight trilogy on June 29th 

My cat got out about a week ago , while we were on vacation for three weeks . < PROPFEMALE > Gruen said she saw < PROPFEMALE > , my cat , a few houses down from my house either yesterday or the day before . Hopefully she'll show up soon . I'll post a few pictures of her and I'll post on here when we find her . 
Still haven't found < PROPFEMALE > , but we are having a 5 month old kitten spend the night . For now , we're calling her Kini , because the first song we heard with her in the car was California Gurls . 
We just got two new kittens . They're two month old tonkinese kittens . My kitten's name is Bandit and my sis's kitten's name is baby . I might post pictures tomorrow . 
Bandit sits and sleeps on my shoulder almost all the time . He's watching me type this while he's up on my shoulder .
