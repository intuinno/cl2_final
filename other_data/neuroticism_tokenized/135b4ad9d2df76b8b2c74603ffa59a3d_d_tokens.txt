Dear floorset , \ 
Why can't you go away ? You're keeping me from locking myself in my room and curling up into fetal position ! 
Why can't i be one of those people that doesn't eat when they're sad , damn skinny bitches ! 
So , I don't know what to do ... What do single people do instead of seeing there boyfriend ? I don't remember ... 
I want a fat cat so i can name him bustopher jones .

It's weird how not doing something can be the hardest thing to do . 
Although parts of it sucked , all in all had a pretty nice day , had a good time with Jarrad Sager , went to rehearsal for < PROPFEMALE > Dei Choral , found out < PROPFIRST > Cagle made it home safe , and got to workout with < PROPMALE > Taalur Ramsey !!! 
I have one very simple wish for today , let's see if someone cares enough to < PROPMALE > it ! 
The greater the risk , the higher the potential return ! 
I really want to see and hear from a certain someone tonight . Who could it be , I hope they get the hint . 
Well today should be interesting . I guess I'll see how everything plays out . 
Today was such great day till about 15 minutes ago ... 
I hate not knowing what I can and can't do without creating more distance . 
wow , today has been exhausting , I'm totally crashing right now . Hopefully my dinner will give me some energy early enough for me to get to the gym tonight . 
All the caffeine I've had today just hit me like a ton of bricks . Red bull , 4 shots off espresso , a venti coffee and gree tea :O JITTERY !!! 
I had so much fun today ! I truly value my time spent with the people who are special to me ! 
I just realized I don't remember what chicken tastes like ... Wow , I've been a pescetarian half my life ... 
I try to keep my promises , I try to keep my life moving forward , but it's still not right . What should I do ? 
YAY , mr , Reece Childs finally made a facebook ! 
Great day of rehearsal , act one is going to be amazing ! 
\Life is neither good nor bad . Life is life and all we know . Good and bad joy and woe are woven fine . \ " \ " You've been a fool and so have I ... And let us try before we die to make some sense of life . We're neither pure nor wise nor good ; we'll do the best we know ... \"" 
Amazing opening night of Candide , hope everyone who didn't see it tonight can make it for Sunday !

So I found an iphone , I was gonna wait for someone to call so I could return it , but I've come to the conclusion this is the most anti-social iphone owner ever . 
I've just decided I hate every piece of clothing I own . Who wants to donate to my couture fund ? 
I love that everyone in this city has a gym membership , I don't even have to buy one , I keep getting free weeks from people xD
