I don't feel well . And I'm stressed out . Sigh . It's just not fair sometimes . 
Going to NYC for the day on saturday ! :-D

I hate interviews . I hate not having a job . And I hate staying home with no money . :-( The bad news is ... even if I get one of the jobs I'm interviewing for , I'll still need to pick up a second position somewhere . Sigh . This is tough . 
Guess who starts working for Carlow University this friday ? This girl ! :-D 
I've been at work since 6:50 am ... wow . Having one functional car is not cool . 
I'm sitting on the patio .
