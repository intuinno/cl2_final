eating yakisoba noodle 
this space is for me to type words that will exhibit how discontent I am . 
Doctor's appointment today . And hopefully HP6 
THIS IS MY STATUS UPDATE ? DO YOU LIKE IT ? 
I hate getting sick on days where I could be doing better things . Like going to see the new < PROPMALE > Potter T__T The world is against me -__- 
I'll admit it , I like the heat . But this ... is too much . I shouldn't burn myself opening car doors ... or stick to leather couches because of my sweat -__- 
I don't really remember last night ... -__- 
Does anyone know of a quality black hair dye that works well and stays in for a while ? 
is using a real computer for once . this site got damn ugly . and will play metro 2033 now instead of this bs :3 
On me way home ! Maybe I will be home in time for dinner ! 
hate that I am actually facebooking this . But someone close to me just passed away . Take that as you will . 
is just realizing it is Friday night . Normal girls my age are probably partying it up and getting crunk or whatever :S Pretty ones are out on dates * mournful sigh * 
nap time was weird . I had a dream I was in a western-style town , and I dressed up like Satan and scared everyone out of their homes and stole their TVs ! 
is such a n00b today ... 
hates thunderstorms 
is gonna go see the new Nightmare on Elm Street movie tonight at the Oak Grove 8 ! 
the new nightmare on elm street was awesome ! < PROPFEMALE > was clutching her box of < PROPFEMALE > the whole time ! she doesn't like < PROPMALE>'s claws :( 
just got the leftover comics from Free Comic Book Day and the newest Mass Effect comic :3 This day is full of fortune . 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > Wars Day , friends ! May the fourth be with you ! :P 
happy cinco de mayo ! hoping everyone gets el muchos tacos y burritos ! bueno ! fiesta !

accidentally squirted lemon juice in her eye ;~;

i messed up on top ramen again ........... 
Happy birthday . I miss you terribly ... </3 
is sick :( 
now that the spider is dead , I can go on that side of my room again :3 
just tried Mtn Dew : Distortion . It reminds me of an old drink called Green River . Somehow , I don't see it being the winner , but it is good :3 
has now tried Mtn Dew : Typhoon ! It's sweeter than most Mtn Dew flavors , but I like it more than Baja Blast , Live Wire , Code Red , Distortion , or original :3 
is now enjoying Mtn Dew : White Out ! It reminds me of Fresca , but in a good way :3 
is watching a puppy for three days <3 
who is < PROPFIRST > Gray ? 
get this p.o.s. thunderstorm away from me ......... 
I've learned something today . As cute as puppies are , they are not for me , because I am lazy . My choices are limited to cats and those fish that only need fed once or twice a week . Yeah >.> 
totally watched Killer Klowns From Outer Space ! :3 
OMFGWTFBBQCHICKEN ! 1 @ this god damn website . it is getting to the point looking at fb hurts my eyes , there are so many updates i can't keep up with any of you anymore . it is pointless ......

All I ever get on here is pokes :S 
As the muggles say , \truth will out . \"" 
is eating a cinbun at 4 in the morning :) A hearty breakfast for a day I plan to sleep through half of :P 
OMG one of the stray kittens from the bar I live behind let me pet it and now it followed me home and I think it wants to live with me >.< <3 
Less than four hours of sleep ? Damnit . D:< 
is so itchy . So many mosquito bites ! -.- Damn me and my sugary Dr Pepper blood ... 
' s thumb hurts very bad . This is Trypticon's fault . I hate him . 
would like for it to start being 85+ degrees now pls 
went clothes shopping . I got some shirts and my first bikini ! One of the shirts may or may not be Miley < PROPMALE > brand ... >.< 
I just made a Red < PROPFEMALE > cake . It didn't turn out very bad . But I had to make the frosting twice because I messed it up the first time . :/ 
You can * like * comments now ?! WAT 
just saw Avatar : The Last Airbender . For 5$ . I wanted Zuko to be hot . He was not . There were other things wrong with the movie . But I'm not telling you . 
blew up some stuff tonight . It was pretty good . 
wants more 4th of July . 
is mad . Her new kitten went doodoo on her Little Mermaid blanky . ; ; 
is tanning nicely . I even got out my fat roll so it can be tan , too . 
just saw Monsters Inc . for the first time . Didn't think it was as good as everyone says , but liked it enough . 
Visiting my auntie up in Washington . :] 
is finally remotely interested in the World Cup . Because of that octopus . I just learned about him ( or her ) yesterday . ^__^ 
is going to Oregon Zoo tomorrow ! ^__^ Is anyone else ? 
has finally been to Five Guys Burgers and Fries . Delicious . Now , to the zoo . 
didn't actually end up going to the zoo ... But that's okay . It was super crowded ... But I still need to go . >.< 
is going outside . 
Fact : the Ewok are named after the Miwok , a Native American tribe indigenous to the Redwood < PROPMALE > . The location where Endor scenes from Return of the Jedi were filmed . This further extends the awesomeness of my race . Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > D , for this . <3 
saw Inception . I thought it was mediocre . As in , I'm okay with not ever seeing it again . But it wasn't \bad\ " . I'd give it a B- " 
went to Five Guys again ^__^ IT IS SO DELICIOUS 
I should have saved my Inception money for < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim . 
chemicals under fingernails hurts ;-; 
just watched < PROPFEMALE>'s Body . It is so good ! 
Taco < PROPFEMALE > has these new tacos that taste like real Mexican food ( I think ... ) and they are dericious . 
All year , I have believed my birthday was on a Saturday . Now that I have switched my calender to the correct month , I see that it's on a Thursday . No good . 
My blue hair is already turning green in some spots . The dye I bought was labeled as Plum Purple . Next time , I shall stick to my favored brand : Manic Panic . 
I've read three books in the past two weeks . No wonder I am so good at spelling . I look at words all the time . x__x 
There will also be Dinosaurs at the Oregon State Fair . Robot Dinos are taking over the world !!! 
I always say the worst sentences . Today it was \my mom called ! I'm so excited-she's gonna give me crabs ! \ " Uhh .. " 
Why do all my favorite jammies get a giant hole in the crotch ? ;~; 
I'm done putting Dinosaurs now ! All pics are up and they look fantastic :3 Considering they are cell phone quality lol Check them out ! 
My kitten loves KFC's chicken x__x 
Today is my little sister's sixteenth birthday . Too bad she has to live with her crazy dad and I'm not allowed to talk to her . 
There is a heat wave coming and also a meteor shower :3 Kind of wish I had someone special to watch it with . Shiny things are pretty . 
Standing strategically behind a dumpster from the bar I live behind is not a good way to watch a meteor shower . But I saw lots of pretties ! :3 Worth it , even if my neck kinda hurts . 
I just tried to shave my legs . I think I have about six inches worth of really bloody cuts .. ; ; 
I have now seen < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim . And all of the Saw movies . So good !!! I even played part of the game :] 
After watching four Saw movies this weekend , I had a dream Jigsaw was chasing an 8-year-old me and my friend so that he could kidnap us and put us into one of his \situations \"." 
My birthday is soon . What should I do ? 
No , I'm not obsessed with < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim . I just think that it is good . That's all . 
Tacos for breakfast ! :D 
Today really sucked balls . :( 
I have noticed that typically , Mountain Dew drinkers are skinnier than Dr Pepper drinkers ... 
I don't want to sound arrogant , but I am starting to actually think I am good looking . Not that it matters , but I do wonder why ... 
This is the beginning of my last day of being 22 . 
is wondering how many ppl only \remembered\ " my birthday because of facebook . " 
I feel like such an asshole right now -.- 
What is the most poorly treated animal in the world ? 
I just finished the first book of Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy . It was fantastic ! I can't believe I avoided it for this long . 
Now I am disturbed . I have just awoken from a strange dream where I was in bed with an old woman , who turned toward me and growled \You have exactly a month before you are going to die for no apparent reason and there will be nothing you can do about it . \ " I'm glad my death is to be untimely and unreasonable . " 
After this morning's sleep paralysis incident , I don't wanna go to sleep alone . But I have to -_- 
Spent about three hours watching Top Model with my mommy :3 What an addicting show ... 
I am confused . In the mirror I look pretty with brown and purple hair . But in the camera I look like a gray-haired man . Inanimate objects DO lie . I want to think it's the camera ... 
I love having a < PROPFEMALE > <3 Cuz I can give her all the food I don't want . Like cold french fries and sausages and eggs . 
Ew . Clouds -____- 
Today I saw an alligator ! 
What is wrong with this site ? Half the things I click on aren't doing anything ... :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > Lung = WORST non-veg Chinese restaurant ever ... 
I know I eat too many Happy Meals because I just got the same Joker toy I got last time >.< 
Haha . There's a line of fat kids waiting for Halo @ Best Buy lol I just left with a 32\ TV . They'll be leaving with a stupid game . :] " 
Since when is SciFi spelled \SyFy\ " ? That is lame and stupid looking . " 
Uh oh . I only have one Dr Pepper to last me the rest of the night . :( 
Somebody left an all day/all zone pass for Trimet in a ticket machine and I found it :3 Thanks , kind stranger ! 
It is cool to see how humongous Jupiter is in the sky ! :3 
watching < PROPFEMALE > trek : tng . < PROPFIRST > crusher was so cute : > 
A hamburger < PROPFEMALE > on a piece of bread topped with salsa ... Dad , we have normal food . You don't have to make the ghetto-est thing possible >.< 
After spending most of the night playing it , I finally beat < PROPMALE > Wake ! I enjoyed it much . 
aww man ! my headphones broke . one of my teeth broke . i'm broke .. and out of Dr Pepper . this day needs some fixing o: 
just got 20$ for all her empty Dr Pepper cans . 60$ still needed . 
Exactly a month ago , an old Demon lady appeared to me in a dream , said I was gonna die in a month for no reason and I couldn't do anything about it , before I woke up unable to move . I think I'm going to live . But I just had another dream about the end of the world .. It was kind of awesome :] 
Does anyone else thinks that facebook movie with that < PROPFIRST > Cera-looking guy looks horrid and boring ? 
Any day with ribs is a good day . 
is cookin ribs 4 the 1st time ever :D they is gonna be good !! 
Halloween is coming , but I do not have a costume yet . Please inspire me with awesomely cheap ideas of what to do this year ! :D

Watching Ponyo , and then go night nights :3 
ten ten ten 
I was too late to pre-order Fallout : NV collector's edition . Then I came home and my cat peed on my bed . :( \ 
But at least I got a new comic book and a giftcard :/ And the hope that some poor kid will cancel his Fallout order so I can have it >__> 
Ew ! I was taking a nice bath and then a spider came and I yelled for my dad to kill it . He did . And then he dropped it in my water :( fmlfmlfml 
I have a really weird love of movies where cars are sentient beings . 
On the news , I just saw there was a \Vampire\ " couple who lured homeless ppl into their house and drank their blood ... That's disgusting and I bet they got AIDS . This is what you get for reading < PROPFEMALE > Rice . " 
\men are always ready to believe two things about a woman- that she is weak and that she finds him attractive . \"" 
Stegosaurus has two brains 
On October 20th a comet will be passing closely by the Earth and we will be able to see it ! \ 
On another note , I will NOT be wearing purple that day . Because I don't condone suicide . 
is thinking about cancelling her order for Fallout : NV ... maybe 
Right now , I weigh more than I have in the past 5 years . Maybe I should be a planet for Halloween ;~; 
is very pleased to know they will be finally making the Hobbit movies :3 Though , I wish < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > would direct them , since he is the best 
A toothache on each side of my mouth and lockjaw today :( My mouth hates me

Right now , all I can think about is < PROPMALE > Potter . 
someone deleted me off of fb ... i'm only disturbed by this because i don't like odd < PROPFIRST > >.> 
and the Goblet of Fire 
It happened again D:< 
I have that stupid G6 song stuck in my head . What is a G6 ? Is it a model of car or plane ? Also what is slizer ? Or Slizard ? It's a < PROPMALE > component of the song . That kind of music really insults my intellect ! 
Who is your favorite < PROPMALE > Potter character ? 
Which Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry House would you belong in ? 
Last night was truly amazing , and the midnight showing was worth the wait . The audience was almost as incredible as the movie . Also thanks , < PROPFEMALE > , for introducing me to the wonder that is Wizard Rock ! <3 
thinks it's a little morbid how Avada Kedavra doesn't sound all that different from Abracadabra . 
Wake up in the mornin ' feelin ' like a snowman- Grab my goggles , put on two jackets , yeah I'm going sleddin ' . Before I leave grab my boots and a pair of snow pants , cuz when I hit the back I'm gonna get trashed . I'm talkin ' playin ' in all that snow , snow- changing into dry clothes , clothes . -Fro$ty 
I just cut off a large portion of my hair . I hope it looks okay ... 
All this talk about Thanksgiving food is making me hungry . I've never had sweet potatoes with little marshmallows , < PROPFEMALE > de Leche , cornbread stuffing , or Christmas wine but it all sounds really good !

I'm pretty sure I'm straight , but I've had A LOT of dreams lately where I am a lesbian with a girlfriend . 
Someone was going to try to carbomb the Christmas Tree Lighting downtown :( That's terrifying . 
I wish they still made white chocolate M&M's . They should do it just as a holiday special or something at least ... 
Welcome December :3 
Just finished reading a good book and my girl < PROPFEMALE > won < PROPFEMALE>'s Next Top Model ! Super happy ! :D 
Does anyone want to go see Tangled with me at Oak Grove 8 ? 
Today is my mom's birthday . HB , Mom ! 
Tangled was soooo cute :3 
uhh i don't wanna have pedos on my fb . especially if they aren't even loyal friends to me . bye bye 
tornado pls 
it's kind of weird when you wake up , it's dark out , you look at the clock and it says 4:30 and you have no idea if that's AM or PM ... 
there seems to be some kind of connection between my friends getting internet girlfriends and my friendships with said people ending shortly after :/ 
There are soooooo many birthdays in December x__x I feel like I am writing hb on ppl's walls every day 
Total Lunar Eclipse tonight . I kind of wish my ceiling were a large glass dome so I could see it AND stay warm x ] 
Christmas at dad's today , yesterday was Christmas at mom's - two timeless holiday traditions to those with divorced parents . More presents that way , it seems . At any rate , I wish every one of you a very fine holiday this year . 
I'm playing Dead Space . I feel like a chicken because I actually think it's scary ;~; 
I think I'm sick ... I haven't been sick since swine flu ! 
I saw something so terrifying on TV that I honestly wish someone was here to comfort me -_- 
Will anyone want to see the Black Swan movie with me soon ? 
Black Swan wasn't that great , but I so had fun with the Lipai sisters <3 and I lurve my purple Unicorn socks ! thx Tash ! 
I had a nice- almost perfect- weekend :3 Except the last part which was ruined by a succubus ;_; 
sloppy joes yes yes yes 
I hope you weren't hinting at what I think you were hinting at , Mr. Observer D:< 
Pls help . In a couple of hours , I'm calling back an employer who interviewed me last week . ( She said to call Monday . ) What do I say ? What should I be prepared for ? And also please pray and hope for me to have good luck ! 
I got new bedding and now my room is extremely purple . It is like Grimace came in here and exploded ... 
clumpy stuck-together eyes T_T i'm never wearing mascara again 
i am super kawaii and could have a valentime if i wanted 
Watching Critters . This movie is good 
I exercised . Now I have to vomit :( What a fatass 
Fringe is on in about 15 minutes ! :D If you are a fan , I hope you will tune in to keep the ratings up . There is no good reason for this show to be in the Friday night death slot while moronic shows like Glee get the good days . I don't want to see my favorite airing TV show get cancelled 
I just had the coolest dream . One of my HotWheels turned into a real car and the greater Portland area was overrun by cannibalistic shapeshifters . My subconscious is so cool ^___^ 
As much as I despise talking on the phone , last night's phone call was fortuitous . Job interview on Thursday . Wish me success and riches , and maybe give me some advice 
There is some snow outside . Not enough for me to make snow ppl though :( 
is living off of Goldfish crackers 
Is anyone of you GOOD at being a job reference ? :P pls pls pls 
Another interview this morning . I think this one has been best of all :3 Hopefully I hear back soon 
Why do atheists care and protest when a church says something like \God hates fags \"?" 
happy birthday < PROPFIRST > bieber !!! 
ignore my last status . Happy birthday SUPERMAN !!! ( though technically Feb 29 , still deserves recognition ) 
Growing somewhat accustomed to hearing Lady Gaga- to the point I am unphased by it- is a lot like getting used to the smell of cat urine 
Now that I have found Waffle Crisp , I will not be capable of feelings of sadness or anger until the very last morsel is gone . Only bliss . 
Is 4000mg of Aspirin a day too much ? 
Movies I want to see : Battle : Los < PROPFEMALE > , Beastly , Red Riding Hood . Anyone interested ? ( Particularly Oak Grove 8 showings ) 
I got Dragon Age 2 now so I am going to play that all weekend . Sorry to anyone who wanted me to be social . You can wait until after my surgery . 
So I had Dragon Age 2 on the menu while I was taking a break listening to some music , and at the same time the trailer thing in the menu started , the song \Invincible\ " by Static-X came on and they went together like perfect . I only wish I could make a video @__@ " 
I beat Dragon Age 2 now . Totally left me wanting more ;_; Also , Fenris is soooooo cute :3 
I really don't like having things extracted from my body ... 
Possible dry socket ? Great . Because I don't already have enough things that I am overly paranoid about ... 
I am craving every food in the Universe right now , but only because I can't eat them . When my mouth is healed I am going to srsly pig out . 
Sometimes , romantic subplots in video games make me feel a little bit lonely , but at least < PROPFEMALE > Hawke does not have to worry about that . 
\food is what you can keep down \"" 
is going to see Red Riding Hood soon with < PROPFEMALE > Headrick . We saw Beastly earlier and it was cute 
is stuck in line behind the coupon lady . You know , the coupon lady who is younger than me and has kids . 
Just woke up a little bit ago . Dad bought a new truck . A ' 40 pickup :) 
I normally do not complain about this sort of thing , but I am mad at whoever decided the Carver bridge needs replacing . Hundreds of thousands of dollars and the only difference will be bike lanes . Umm . There are no bike lanes within two < PROPMALE > . And they killed a bunch of nice trees :( 
I made some crepes . They are so delicious , but next time I am just going to have Toaster Streudels ... much less work . 
This is my morning . Good morning . 
is thinking to cutting or dying her hair . What hair would look best , if you can think of one ? 
You know how there is Wizard Rock ( a < PROPMALE > Potter themed genre of music) ? Well I had an idea . There should be Dragon Age themed Dragon (?) Rock . Yes I would listen . It would get me pumped for slaying Darkspawn and giving BioWare all of my money ! Yes . 
The black crayon always dies first . 
I had a tooth pulled and now the OTHER side of my mouth hurts ; ; Excruciatingly . Like , I would rather get stung by bees while reliving my past break-ups , while listening to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , with Jersey Shore on TV and have my Xbox red ring . Those things are all much less painful ... 
I am now in possession of the banana Twinkies . Too bad it hurts to eat them . 
I feel like a jerk when I deny friend requests , but you could at least have SOMETHING in common with me first . \We both live in Oregon\ " does not count . " 
One of my root canal fillings just fell out . It is like I have three missing teeth now , instead of two . I shall never smile again .
