R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Grey #2 ... 

so tired . working alot can really drain your soul and leave you feeling like an empty shell ... but it is rewarding . 
going to quit smoking . i am scared to death ... this might just make me snap ... heh heh eh eh . 
well ... have not succeded on this mission of mine ... the nicotine sharks ate me up and spit me out ... i broke down and got me a pack ... i have to wait till the weekend so i am not at work ... outside of work i dont smoke as much ... i pray that i can make it through this ... 
i have been smoking for so much of my life that just the thought of quiting really does scare me ... well ... i know i can beat this retardation of mine ... with gods help , < PROPFEMALE > from my beautiful woman ... and a whole lot of swear words ... 
oh my god ... i am exahusted ... get off at midnight , back to work at 0730 , home by 1030 , back to work by 1200 ... off at 2400 ... back to ... ( shoots self with tranqulizer gun ... ) 
just for the record ... i did not forget ... she woke me up and \reminded\ " me ... but i plan on surprising her tomorrow ... i really am not a < PROPMALE > ... just exahusted . " 
ho-lee shite !!! if i work just a little bit harder ... i could finally see the < PROPFEMALE > gates with out filling out a vacation request form ... 
weekend ... finally ... here ... so glad to still be alive ... and time to really stop smoking ... starting on monday ... wish me luck ... 
ok ... two more cigs ... then monday on ... none ... it might help to stay busy ... but all i know i cannot rock the way i used to and running after a short while ... it is hard to breath ... and i hate being an addict ... so on to health and long life ... but there is one problem ... that is < PROPFEMALE>'s music . 
OK ... Day 1 no smoking ... i feel good ... other than the irresistable urge to beam the next person that talks to me into open space ... but other than that ... 
day 1 and a half ... FAILURE !!! I suck ... oh well ... it will be another day ... 
CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEW PREDATOR MOVIE !!!!!!!!!! 
JULY 9TH ... PREDATORS ... I FEEL GIDDY ALL OVER ... \

So True ... I read it twice . 
off to work ... make the dough ... still need some sleep and a beer . 
well ... 12 hour day yesterday ... probly 12 more today ... i am going to be one tired puppy ... well , minus the cute exahusted look ... 
... tired ... sooo tired ... happy wallet = tired < PROPFIRST > ... no complaints ... love life and my woman ... but i still have a crush on sleep ... and the bed . 
ahhh ... this < PROPFIRST > WEINHARDS BLONDE is sooo refreshing after such a long day working in a hot factory ... reminds me of summers past when i had no such responsabilities and no cares ... 
now that work is done ... time to sleep like i am dead ... in fact ... i will call in on monday ... let them know i am attending my own funeral ... heh heh 
BEER !!!! Thats all I have to say about that . 
Do you ever feel like you are a stranger ... even to your self ... sometimes I wish that i could just be normal ... well , at least think normally . I guess I will fight on and maybe , just maybe I can get over life's hurdles ... 
man ... i am soooo happy ... i got home ... and i am drinking coffee and eating ... FOOD !!! COFFEE !!! BEER !!! and some other important things ... \ 
P.S. SLEEP !!! 3 DAY WEEKEND !!!

Drama is like Dysentery ... and dumb bitches talking shit doesnt make them smart ... BEER ! 
wow ... heat sucks ... work is getting really hot and long ... hope everyone enjoyed the worlds greatest nation's birthday . and i hope it was safe . God Bless . 
You know what ... my job is sooo hot ... just being in the building ... which is between 20-25 degrees hotter then outside , and my job , i go into machines that are running between 300 to 400 degrees ferinheit on one side , the other is between 275-325 degrees celcius . 
but life is good ... 
man ... 6 days straight ... i am going to sleep for 21 hours and 19 seconds ... 
I really love < PROPMALE > Grey Tea ... just thought you should know . 
Onward and upward ... to work , place of my sacrifice , place of my misory , place of my paycheck , life is good , but no matter what , work sucks . 
eating burritos , watching ghost videos online , then taking a shower ... tomorrow i go in for a UA !!!! 
< PROPMALE > GIBSON'S A LUNATIC !!! Just heard the tapes ... Ho ... lee ... shite !!!! 
my mind is a mess of thoughts ... 
Change is the hardest thing for me in life ... i dont do too well with it ... now to find my own niche within this troublesome changing life ... through strife and tribulations , i emerge stronger for it ... now all i have to do is work on my flaws and build me up to where i could be , and not where im at . 
going back to 12 hour days ... starting today ... YEEEEEE HAAWWWWW !!! 
SOME ONE WATCH MY VID PLEASE ... I WORKED SO HARD ON IT ... heh heh heh 
going to work ... feeling good ... making the money and then home to sleep ... Maybe . 
i am not able to get online very often , if at all . so Goodbye all , hope to talk to yuou all later ...
