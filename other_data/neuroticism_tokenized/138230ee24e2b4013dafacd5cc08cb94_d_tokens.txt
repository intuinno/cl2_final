Remember this Christmas ; when you're eating your dinner , smiling and laughing , that in another house somewhere , there's an empty chair where a Hero should be sitting . They gave up their life or are oversea's , so that you can sit with your family . So light a candle for the Heroes that did not make it home for those who are still serving out in Afghanistan and Iraq ! Repost this to show your respect ?
