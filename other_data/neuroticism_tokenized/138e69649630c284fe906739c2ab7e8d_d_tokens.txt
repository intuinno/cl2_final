Going swimming tomorrow , wishing Lee-Michael Torcedo and < PROPFEMALE > Torcedo were here to go with me , I could use some entertainment when I play water-volleyball . =] 
Its funny how people let go of the life lessons they should hold on to and when things go down hill , they look everywhere else but at themselves for someone to blame . smh . 
At my mom's job , harassing her . :] 
Don't start nothin , won't be nothing ... I can't stop half the stuff that comes out of my mouth and I ain't liable if it hurts your feelings .

Ugh , nothing to do ... guess i'll take another nap ... text me . =] 
Sometimes things go wrong so they can go right , so this whole big mess just means I have to find a way to make this a masterpiece in the end . 
Thinking about you constantly is exhausting and it doesn't help that I can't even talk to you ... =/ But I excel rather than fail at the things that should bring me down , so like everything else , I'll be alright . Best believe babyy , & hearts ; 
Dear Person , \ 
You're so full of Sugar-Honey-Ice-Tea , did you know that ? 
Just made triple fudge chocolate cake , between me and my dad , half of its gone . =]]]

but dang , its hard to not think of you . 
In Florida . =) Ready to start a new chapter in my life , && in this one ... I'm writing your character off . & hearts ; 
I thought ' Southern Hospitality ' applied to all Southern states , but I'm guessing Florida is an exception . Good thing I won't be here long or I'd get fired from a job for going off on someone for giving me the stank eye like they got a problem . Tsk Tsk . 
Texting the boo , < PROPFEMALE > Zientek . Ready to strangle Oreo because he's making all this noise for no freakin reason ... sleep would be a lovely welcome . 
Fitful sleep thanks to Oreo , woke up and did some new house cleaning , now Imma lay down for a nap .. hopefully this dude chills with his tryna climb the wall crap . 
Bahaha , I have the feeling that tonights gonna be a good night . Oreo's locked away downstairs , far from me and distrubing my sleep . Finally a good night's rest coming my way , & hearts ; 
Ugh , I always manage to mess crap up , wtf ? Apparently there is nothing I can do that is good enough . 
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love\

Fml with these friggin health issues . :/ 
Hmm , so I like the days where I can talk to you for hours and get up to a text or phone call from you and do it all over again that night . :) 
Always be grateful for what you DO have in life , whether you think it's a good thing or not , there are people far worse off than you think ... 
Almost done with FTAC ! Yea ! Finally get to start my actual job , woot ! 
Don't blame others for decisions that you've made in life because at what point , it was what you wanted . 
I hate having allergies , makes having fun hard . And Rajhaun < PROPMALE > isn't makin it any better tryna tell me to go to bed . Lol . :)

I keep spending all my time thinking just thinking about you , I don't know what do . I think I'm falling for you . :) 
Lol I don't do crap except pt , work , and sleep . What a mess I've become . :) 
And then there was remorse ... 
Not gonna write you a love song because you asked for it ... 
Ugh fml 
Here's to staying up late babysitting , coming home at three am , watching Prison Break til five am , and waking up early still pissed bout the stupid ish people do . 
Spending the night at a friend's , let's see what trouble I can get into tonight . 
Working with a tummy ache thanks to dominos pasta bowl and cinna stix . :) worth it though . 
Aggravated , relieved , indecisive , apologetic , loathing , stupid , crazy , and ignorant ... Yup , I think those words just about sums up how I feel . 
Love me , love me , say that you'll love me . Fool me fool me , Ohh how you do me . Kiss me kiss me , say that you miss me . Tell me what I wanna hear . 
I miss the < PROPFEMALE > thing that runs around my momma's house causing utter chaos . :) 
Funny how when you got a good thing going , you don't know what the hell to do ... 
I remembered my favorite BMT song from church . :) 
On the ball

Literally the happiest big kid right now . Asked my momma to send me things for my dorm to cook with and whatnot , and she sent goodies . :) I love her . 
I don't care which bestie or good friend does it , just really need a pick me upper tonight . Bad day became a bad night . :'( 
Deciding what's best for me is like trying to find a needle in a haystack , because I'll always take the feelings of others involved into consideration . 
There's truly something to be said for the people who can just as easily ruin your day just as much as they can make it . 
Super proud . 3 mile run without stopping , wasn't last , and sprinted the end like a pro . Hua . 
So tell me why out of myself and my 3 roommates , I'm the ONLY one who eats sweets , but yet when I have really good sweets , stuff goes missing . Smdh 
Let's make it a good day , wish I could talk to mister rightleftcenter . Lol . Imy . 
Lmao , dinner with bechtel , cam , and sargent . They're a mess . :) 
Missing her little baby boy . There is definitely something to be said for little bundles of chaos . Innocent one second and bad as all get out the next . :) 
Needs something to do 
Men are like books , once you've read it , on to the next and reading it again is more of a chore than a leisure . 
Bowling with bechtel and twinkle toes aka milano . These dudes are hilarious . 
Cam , milano , bechtel , and reeder ... goin for a good night 
Clean up time . :) 
Speak ya mind and have no worries . I don't . ;) 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , \ 
I love you . ;) 
So many things that I would say if only I was able .... 
Ugh , the one day I like busted butt running uphill in pt , revellie wasn't on time so I'd have a break ! Wtf ?! 
California tomorrow night !!! I'm so excited . Seeing family makes for a great weekend . :) 
So I'm thinkin I'll have gray hairs if I don't get a nap in soon or eat something fattening . 
In California . ;) 
Hmm , so I love my family here in California . Makes everything interesting even when sleepy . I love you Simmons family ! :) 
Easy come , easy go , that's just how you live ... oh ! Take take take , but you never give . 
Am I more than you bargained for yet ? 
Music is so soothing 
Haha , I love how they took me to a comedy despite having said yesterday they wouldn't because of how loud I am . :) 
Back home again ... who's down for a run ? :) 
Watching white chicks . Lol 
In pain , I despise being sick 
Nap time !!! 
By actions and words we lose the things we < PROPFEMALE > most . 
Sometimes things go wrong so that others will go right . 
So wallyball is like the best sport ever . :) we lost ( Hehe thanks to me ) , but that game was pretty darn close ! ;) 
Hanging with the guys . :) ( phone works both ways . ) 
Feels like I'm saying \I'm sorry\ " a lot this week . Fml . " 
Chilling with the guys . :) So hyper . 
Hmm I miss my Momma . Can't wait til July ! 
Hmm , there seems to be something I miss ... oh , its you . :) 
Can't seem to fall asleep . 
Hanging with the guys . 
Good day , good night ... loving life . <3 
Don't know what to do today .... 
Another night with the guys . <3 
Haha , fun night ... got pulled over , whooped everyone in bowling , half a movie , < PROPFIRST>'s , late night run to the shoppette and wal mart . :) 
Deep down I'm still that little kid who's chasing a fairytale . <3 
Guess I'll stop being lazy and actually go to the gym ... maybe . :) 
Is sad , and for once food or napping won't make me feel better ... in this matter , I give up because apparently there's no sense in trying . 
Note to self : DON'T run five < PROPMALE > the night before squadron PT because you know ya'll will run at least a mile up some friggin hill . 
Pt time .... 
Haha so Nastashia is gonna have me do the diet we did last year .... where I don't eat the things I love like fried food and cheese . EVERYTHING has cheese !!! 
** phone rings**\ 
Me : Hello ? \ 
Miller : How's the most beautiful girl in all of Arizona ? \ 
;) I love you < PROPMALE > ! 
So not a happy camper . :/ 
Watching < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World ... makes me happier . 
Running a 5k tomorrow , first one hundred gets a t-shirt . Wish me luck !!! ;) 
My allergies are kickin my butt , not sure how I'll run tomorrow . Fml !!! 
So for the 5k , got a t-shirt , but not because I was the first 150 in . Lol . Good run this morning . ;) 
One of these days , I'll get to the point where I won't give a care and nothing will ruin my day . The simple things are most often the most disappointing . 
Forgetting the issues of the day , making this a good night . Going out with the guys . :D 
Food and sleep .... that's all I want this day to consist of . 
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind . ;) 
Same sh*t , different day . Go figure . 
Bad thing about sleeping most the day is you can't fall asleep later that night . 
Haha , FINALLY getting to < PROPFEMALE > out with Nore ( Noremil Rodriguez) !!! 
Surprisingly a good end to my crappy weekend , only thing missing is you . :) 
Let's make today a good day ! :) 
Really happy ! My dad comes to visit next week , first birthday he'll spend with me !, I get my new car in July , going to Vegas in July ... I'm blessed !!! 
On my A game babyyy !!! ;) Best believe yo . 
Hmm thinking of running 5 < PROPMALE > after I'm done being awesome . :) 
Blah , you're such a liar . 
Good pt workout ... only problem is it hurts to sit . Haha . Gonna make it a good day like every other day !!! :) 
So tomorrow morning we got a wallyball match ! It's on like donkey kong !!!! 
I hate being told \I'm a grown man\ " as an excuse to do something . :/ " 
It's gotta suck knowing the worst player on the opposing team can talk smack . Lmao . I'm so awesome . :) :) :) 
Bowls of cereal and NCIS marathons ... sure way to my heart . <3 
In the best of moods . ;) 
Ahh , working . 
Getting tired ... work again in the AM ... when's the weekend ? 
Hmm 2 days til dad gets here , 3 til I'm 19 , and 7 until the weekend !!! Finally an end to the 12 straight days of work . :) 
Ugh , I hate lying . Makes me feel bad . :( 
:) There's something to be said for the man who'll do anything for that ONE woman . 
Nap and then opening/closing the Oasis , going to be a long night followed by finally seeing my dad . Let's make this day better . :) 
I'm still spoiled even at 19 , good day overall , dinner was entertainment , thank you everyone who said happy birthday . :) I'm truly blessed . 
Today I don't feel like doing anything ... 
Long eventful day , hiking tomorrow with me dad . :) Calling it a night . 
Gah !! Even on my day off , I get up early ! Darn ... 
How about a movie night with just me and you ? Who's in ? 
Your luck is running out with me < PROPFEMALE > 
Getting another tattoo today possibly . :) daddy and me time <3 
Yo creo que hoy fue < PROPFEMALE > buen < PROPFEMALE > con mi papa . ;) 
Calling it quits . 
Gotta get in the zone to study !! 
Late night drive with Duran = possible heart attack . Lol . 
Wishes it was Friday al-friggin-ready ... I wouldnt feel so effin stressed out . 
One day , I'd love to get flowers just BECAUSE it is Wednesday ... <3 
One day , I'd love to be chilling in my room and my doorbell rings randomly and its you ... <3 
A test of my will power is what this diet will be . Nastashia , you better give loads of encouragement since it was your idea . :P 
Somedays ( like today ) I think you take me for granted . 
Phone's off for the weekend . 
:) Good weekend , I'll say . 
Feels like I'm back at home ... I'll think on rearranging my room , and then do it randomly one day . Thanks for the inspiration Gabe . 
:) I just love NCIS . Peaceful day and I love it ! 
Ugh , can't sleep with a headache and irritated throat . 
Since < PROPFIRST > wants to complain ... I love you < PROPFIRST > McCroary ! ( Better ? ) 
Can't wait til Friday already ! :) 
Hmm , I love me and I'm loving life ! :) 
Haha , at this rate , my doctor will know me by a first name basis and vice versa . 
Haha , I love my bestie < PROPFEMALE > because only SHE would send a card like that . <3 
If I get put on quarters tomorrow , I'll be so pissed . 
La la la loving me some life . :) 
Dear someone , \ 
Come take care of this sick-ling ! 
I've always wanted to kiss in the rain ... <3 
I'll keep you my dirty little secret ! ;) 
It's the hidden intent in what you say that sets people's ire off . 
Another addiction ... watching GLEE . :) 
Gah , the longest I've stayed up in a while I think . One hour til he's here ! Yay ! :) 
Finally ! Sleep ! :) 
Phone vibrates ... \ 
Me : \ random text ?! \ " \ 
By far , I do think this weekend was the best I've had since I've moved to Arizona . <3 
Making this day good ! 
Just a small town girl , living in a lonely world . <3 
Good movie and someone to hold me ... just about all I need . <3 
Time for a replacement . :) 
Certain things just don't matter anymore and you're one of em ' . 
Gah ! It's too effin early to be up 
I miss my WaLugi . <3 
Just worked out ... feeling like running the around the base , but not going to overdue it . Gotta get in shape to look hot when I go to the lake . :) 
\I want you to let me be ... your one and only . \ " -Adele\ 
Today's agenda : DFAC Birthday Dinner and Gym to work out my frustration . 
I gotta say , that dinner made my night . :) Loving life babyyy 
Gravity is working against me and wants to bring me down ... <3 
Late night run around the base , 2.15 < PROPMALE > on the elliptical , sit-ups , weights , and 500meter rowing session ... get like me . :) 
In the best mood thanks to you . <3 
Fml , lost all my contacts . :'( 
So if you feel up to it , text me your name and number so I know who's number is whose . 
Scratch that , I forgot how awesome my phone is . 
What to do ? What to do ? 
Guess I found something to do . Hanging with the girls and five guys I don't know . Haha . 
Paying for my late night partying ways . Volunteering this early equals one hell of a nap later . 
Shower , bowling , then bed ! I'm ready ! 
Sgt Baber ... what's for dinner ? ;) 
Two or three more months and I'll get to see the lil munchinkin that has my heart and wreaks havoc on my Momma's house . <3 
\You've been on my mind . \ 
Thinking I'm reading into things . 
Fml ! I'm so bored . I definitely need something to do . 
Boredom averted 
What's this ? Everyone call < PROPFEMALE > night ? 
Stepping my running game up .... definitely proud of myself . :) 
Nap time and my Walugi is missing ... 
M-effin J-ello !!!! :) 
Late night phone calls . <3 
About to be the grouchiest thing since the Grinch . 
I do what I HAVE to so that I can do what I WANT to . 
Put this as your status if you are brave . For the next 24 hours i will be 100% HONEST . You can ask me in my inbox , anything and i will answer it . :) 
Lake with < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 
Haha , i dont know how a trip to the lake got turned into a roadtrip to Flagstaff , but i loved it . :) 
Great day out with < PROPFEMALE > , but you're a disappointment to my day . 
Gonna make this the best weekend since I moved to Arizona . :) 
Wtf ?! Why the hell is everything effin closed ! 
Im making today my IDGAF day 
That's the last time I answer my phone when I roll over , up for nearly an hour tryna go back to sleep ! :/ 
Eh , I tend to act rash when angered , but not gonna apologize . You're effin < PROPFIRST > with me . 
Having a pretty shitty day . :\\ 
Sometimes things have to go wrong so that they may go right ... 
Friday !!!! 
It's the fact that I'm imperfect that makes me perfect ... :) 
Mmm I love how others get a \promise\ " and I get the \ " uh idk maybe\ " or \ " we'll see\ " ... oh yea I feel like I'm up there on your list . Go suck a nut . " 
Oh I wish I was an < PROPFIRST > Meyer wiener !!! Everyone would be in love with meeeee ! :) 
Poke . 
The best things in life are free , remember that and strive to keep it . 
Deciding on if next weekend is worth it . 
Crossfit for the first time ever , Ahh ! 
Oh I will definitely be sore tomorrow .... 
Crop dusting ... ;) 
Haha , I must say I definitely love life . <3
