\Before you can learn a new way of doing things 
\It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them . They went out and happened to things . \ " \ 
IT'S SNOWINGGGGGGG !!!!! 
\I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed . \ " \ 
Remember , remember , the fifth of November . 
\Avoid the crowd . Do your own thinking independently . Be the chess player
