Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand , that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... They have been eaten by dragons . 
trying to upload new pics and it won't work : ( 
cares for all of you !!! Let's see who in my Friend's List actually pays attention . Copy and repost this in your own bulletin . Let's see who the true friends are .......... :)
