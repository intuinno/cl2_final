Be more concerned with your character than your reputation , because your character is who you really are—while your reputation is merely what others think you are . 
Celtics best not choke in these last minutes . \ 
Better not have taken away the < PROPMALE>'s < PROPMALE > at a ring for no damn reason . 
Celtics would knock out Lebron for nothing . \ 
Assholes .

You have no idea how hurt I am in this very moment . I didn't just fail myself , I failed you too . 
Watchin the first couple seasons of 24 , ya know , back when it was good , and this last scene legit got me choked up . Bauer was saying goodbye to his daughter .. Granted , he isn't really going to die , and I know that what's his face is gonna take care of the nuke instead but all the same , a father saying goodbye to his daughter when he knows he's going to die ... :,( 
Toy Story 3 was really really good :) 
well now I'm confused >.< 
You ever know you're about to do something really really really stupid but you do it anyways ? Yea >.> 
Got up from laying down with < PROPFEMALE > , brushed my hair and I find a freakin ' booger in it . \

Just one of those days where every hour that passes by , makes the day worse . Should just quit and go to sleepp 
This whole hour by hour thing is still holding true >.< 
When you admit that you're wrong , it counts as being right , so technically I'm always right :) 
I needa relaaax 
Yes , I am just like everyone else , in fact , how about you emotionally rape someone like ya did to me and then we'll see just how much like everyone else I really am :D 
I don't know what to do right now .. I don't know how to fix this . Fuck ... I don't remember the last time I've felt like this , I don't even remember if I have felt like this ... fuck ... please stop ... 
People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true . That's how they define \reality . \ " But what does it mean to be \ " correct\ " or \ " true ? \ " Merely vague concepts ... Their \ " reality 
\Your love makes me strong . Your hate makes me unstoppable . \""

fuckin new cat woke me up at 6:43 ... >.> 
I'm boredd . 
I really hope that the shitty ass Avatar movie makes enough money for them to make a sequel . Just fire the people who made that piece of crap and hire a new staff\ 
If that shitty movie can make 100 million dollars in two weeks , imagine what it would have made if it was good . I really hope they consider a sequel with a new staff :( 
Pandoraaa <3 <3 <3

This movie is perfect >.< 
Ohhh < PROPMALE > , you never let me down . Directors like you , Scorsese and < PROPMALE > make up for the posing assholes like Shyamalan and < PROPFIRST > . 
Damn it ... Pandora has adapted to me too much . When I ask it to play songs like Space Bound now , it plays rock songs instead of rap >.< lmao

I find it hilarious how many people wrote on here that they're watching Jersey Shore O.O I've seen about 5 minutes total of that show , I just don't see the point . 
Asking < PROPFEMALE > + Astros = instajizz . 
So I went to go and see Inception for a second time , and I had to pee . I went to the urinal , and started peeing when two chuckling gay men decided to stand on either side of me . I turned my head back and forth and they both smiled at me . What the fuck . 
Holy fucking shit . There were like 11 chopper gunners in that match . lmfao . Nigga was 115-11 . lmfao 
You're waiting for a train ; a train that will take you far away . You know where you hope this train will take you , but you can't be sure . Yet it doesn't matter - because we'll be together .

And I close my eyes tonight , to symphonies of blinding light -- God save us everyone , will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns ? Like memories in cold decay . Transmissions echoing away , far from the world of you and I , where oceans bleed into the sky . \

I swear to god if my power goes out again >.> 
I threw a kid to the ground today :)

Imma be starting a Fantasy Football League soon , but I need to know who's going to be in it . Let me know if you're interested , I need 11 teams :) 
Nfl.com made Fantasy wicked badass O.O It's all customizable , so I messed with the scoring system a little bit , and I added a FLEX position player ( extra WR or RB ) to the roster . I also made the league , since you're able to change the draft date now :) Much more convenient . \ 
I'm able to send the invites via Facebook according the the website , it's just not working at them moment , so expect an invite soon :D 
Finally try to wear my fuckin rubber bands and the things snap FIVE motherfucking straight times . Fuck it , I'm going to bed without em >.>

Damn the Eagles suck . McNabb is laughing at you .

The last time I was this excited for Monday Night Football , Favre was going to Lambou as a Viking . Can't wait for the first Favre to Moss TD . 
Ow . 
I recently had a crazy ass dream that involved a corpse , a dying lover , explosions , a prairie , theaters , Ms. Smith , and being chased by a white horse . \ 
How fucking bonkers is that ? 
If I should give you any thought , it's just to teach self how to not . 
Someone tell me what we have for AP Lit hw . 
So I get home .. and my sister Sofy is just chilling in my room . Legit , my beds covered in her homework , she's got ranch and carrot sticks on my table and she's just ... chilling here watching < PROPMALE > Jr. \ 
What the hell makes her think she can do that all of a sudden o.O ? 
I need AP Lit hw again . Please lay out not only what's due tomorrow , but what's due for the rest of this week . \ 
kthnxbai . 
Sucking < PROPMALE > is for bitches and queers . 
Okay soooo I really need some quotes to put in this article by tomorrow ... lmao . If anyone can share their thoughts about the co-presidency , be it positive or negative ( if you'll think it will work out , or your thoughts about it in general ) pleeeeeeeeeease share . The final draft is due tomorrow and this part of it is kinda important :P 
Look at Donavan McNabb walkin ' into Chicago with his Drebeats on >.< 
The Patriots game is so much less entertaining than I expected it to be ... 
Vikings <3 
\You can't have your cake and eat it too . \ " \ 
After I took a single bite out of my delicious red apple , I dropped it on the floor and now it's all linty . \ 
Saddest . Moment . Ever .

My knee hurts >.> 
Son , I am disappoint . 
Did I really just witness a football team run the football into the endzone with their offensive line STANDING UP ? >.> 
Are you kidding me >.> 
Alyssia just told me she can't wait until I go to college . \ 
That's love . <3 
That right there , is why its complete and utter bullshit that Peyton Manning is named the 8th best player in the NFL of all time , and < PROPMALE > is 26th . 
Wow , I rape with Minato Namikaze :) 
I wanna play Black Ops >.> 
od tired 
They be trollin ' ODEE 
I never would have guessed that helping Sofy with her homework would be THIS difficult . O.O 
I'm selling an Xbox 360 and a controller with a 180GB Harddrive for real cheap , tell me if your interested .

I'm selling an Xbox and controller for a hundred bucks .. and it's actually sitting in my room now . Someone should buy it :D 
Fuck you Charter .

Woodhead just got a TD with Welker as his lead blocker . That's gotta be the \smallest\ " TD duo in NFL history . >.<" 
Lookin ' more and more like those SuperBowl champ Patriots that I've missed so much . 
Running it three straight times was fucking stupid , now we gave the ball back to Peyton with all that time left . When there are 4 minutes left in the game and youre only up by a FG and Peyton is on the other side , you dont try to burn the clock , you try to score ; that was terrible play calling . \ 
C'mon Pats >.> 
And that's why you keep believing . Good shiiit . 
< PROPFEMALE > - What camo do you want ? Warsaw . \

I've played so much Black Ops today ; it's ridiculous .

Wow . < PROPFIRST > Peterson is really good , in case you didn't know .

Only one absence ? I'm about to just randomly take a day off and call it a snow day . 
Alright , who signed on to my FaceBook and spent all my Family Feud money >.>

I'm about to just not do this Lit essay . 
I'm really fucking disappointed .

So why is < PROPFIRST > Boudreau such a fagot ? 
First time I start up WoW , I play for nine hours straight . I'm not even done yet ! 
PLEASE - put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost . 
I can't wait to be woken up by my sisters in about four hours because common app was soooo retarded that it took me 2+ hours to submit >.> shits crazy .
