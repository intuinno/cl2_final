So ... while walking down the streets of mamont I ran into a zombie . Unarmed I started running towards my house . He told me not to run . Baffled I stopped and chatted with the corpse . Unbeknown to most of us , the undead are not actually bad people . Infact this particular fellow had a PHD in neurology , and had an exquisite taste for free form jazz . I hate stereotypes .
