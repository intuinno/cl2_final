woke up like seven times this morning . 

Sleep evades me at this late hour ... maybe I'll play Bowser's Inside Story ... 
So very tired ... must try to sleep at regular times sometime eventually maybe . 
Saw a three-day novel ad , and really wanna do it . Really hate being poor/not having a job sometimes . 
Just got done watching Dragon : the < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > story . Now I'm all pumped up to smash some people ! 
Darkness only holds sway until the light shines upon it . 
is playing Fantasy Earth Zero . Fairly new MMO from Square Enix . Hopefully good things come of it . 
Fantasy Earth Zero : Awesome to the tenth degree . 50 vs 50 pvp . If you feel like joining my team , I'm on Gevrandia's side . 
Insomnia : it sucks . Just sayin ' . 
Invictus : go watch it . Good movie . 
I think I'm sick ... my stomach and head feel like shit ... gotta sleep it off . 
Being sick is no fun . 
Feeling a little better now . 
wishes he knew someone with a copy of fallout 2 
So , my D&D group type people . My DM for my other game is sick , so I'm wondering if anyone has time this week to get together and just do a purely roleplay session , as well as me handing out gear . 
After far too long , Malice will be return to the battlefield , ready for blood . 
Found my PK dice , thanks to < PROPMALE > . Be ready for a bloodbath on tuesday , guys :P 
And suddenly , I awaken and it's almost one T_T And I really wanted to bust some heads today . 
Conquest of the Empire = awesome game . 
is surprised by being awake . 
Ahem . WAAAAAAARGH ! That is all . 
Damn I'm sore ... and tired ... and burned . Sunlight and I aren't friends anymore . Anyways , back from Dark Tides , peoples . AoM totally beat down everyone there , so it was a whole big lot of fun . 
Facebook . Goodnight . Yeah . 
So , won't be able to make it out tomorrow seeing as how my cousin is leaving the day after . Sorry , I just found this out , so I'm telling you now . 
What's greater than god , more evil than the devil , < PROPMALE > people need it , poor people have it , and if you eat it you'll die ?
