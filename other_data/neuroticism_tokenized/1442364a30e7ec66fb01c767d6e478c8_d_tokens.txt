California is a JOKE . Just remember when THEY complain about state workers are lazy and deserve to lose jobs to the count of 40,000 . These same people dont understand thats 40,000 more applicants in the current job market . Furthermore 10% of inmates per prison to be released in the next year with 33 prisons housing 3000 to 5000 inmates per prison , still dont seem to know why crime is rising . I wonder why ? 
All my soccer kids need to be sleeping soon , you have your first game at 8:00 tomorrow . Let's do work . 
GN all long day tomorrrow ... Track and soccer .. Peace
