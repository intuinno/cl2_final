Going to chapel cemetery to record some videos with my bros 

shit , i broke a string :( 
I was Hacked ? 
music monor back ordered my cab , now I have to wait for another 3 weeks :[ ] 
sometimes i feel so alone that i just don't know it feels like i been down this road before so alone and cold like something takes over me when i go home and close the door this place smells like < PROPFEMALE > vu i wanna get away from this place i do\ 
\ 
but i won't , until i try , but i know its a lot and why i just don't know 
if you wanna < PROPFEMALE > out , you gotta take her out\ 
cocaine\ 
if you wanna get down , down on the ground\ 
if you have bad news ; and you wanna kick them blues\ 
and when your days are done ; and you wanna run\ 
if everything is gone ; and you wanna < PROPFEMALE > on\ 
don't forget this fact , can't get back\ 
she don't lie , she don't lie , she don't lie .... cocaine\ 
Lyrics by < PROPFIRST > Clapton 
Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are . 
Heaven's not a place that you go when you die\ 
It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive 
my mom set me up with music theory and ear training lessons for a christmas gift . 
\We have no right to express an opinion until we know all of the answers \"" 
\Bass guitar is my inner friend . Its always there until the end \"" 
power to groove 
blow my nose , can't feel my toes ... cocaine 
\cocaine is like really evil coffee\ " - < PROPFIRST > Love " 
I have more chances of being a rock < PROPFEMALE > then repairing my brain cells 
\devil's coffee \"" 
11:30 pm 
my mum is walking out the door :) 
time to escape 
i want a drummer 
god , i'm a fuck up 
lets turn down the volume with vaium 
i think i'm going insane . i don't know if i'm alive or dead . i'm losing myself . i'm so confuse . i can't take this bullshit life of mind . I feel alone . going to my dad's house next weekend to isolate . i need some time put shit together . i can't believe school is tomorrow . I'm gonna drug myself again and see what happens tomorrow . 
i believe rock and roll is slowly fading away and i want to save it . 
i'm slow ... lets speed things up with some blow 
my first fun in a cup :) 
can't sleep 
picking up heroine tomorrow 
going outside 
if u wanna get down , low on the ground , cocaine . \ 
if u wanna have fun , while on the run , cocaine . \ 
if u have bad news and u wanna kick them blues . \ 
Cocaine 
should i pop or should i stop ?
