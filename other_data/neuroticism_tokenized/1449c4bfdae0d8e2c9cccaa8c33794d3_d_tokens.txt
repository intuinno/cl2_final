WHERE ARE ALL MY FRIENDS ?! Fugdissearchgadget . 

A friday night with < PROPMALE > Eastwood . Not so bad 
Balls . Late for work again ! This insomnia thing is kicking my ass . 
\ ... sometimes you don't know exactly what's going to happen when you tickle the tail of the tiger . \"" 
\ ... what was I thinkin when I said ' good night ? ' \"" 
This supposed monsoon season is a pitiful joke . Enough with the excessive heat advisories and dust storms already . All I want is a little rain ! Is that too much to ask ? 
Baah . I'm up to my minds eye in debt ! I need a new job . Preferably something that pays over 10/hr . Hell , I'll even settle for 10/hr so longs as they actually provide the raises they promise ! Well over 1 1/2yrs with Airfoil Tech . and I haven't seen a singl 
I am conducting the next biblical exodus . We'll begin walking out of this valley at 6am . Bring your own sandals and plenty of water . Oversized hats optional . 
A good man is easy to kill 
I'm convinced Tylenol is just a placebo 
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes ; jesus christ died for nothing , I suppose 
lets make like spoons 
My fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 
Each week keeps topping the last for longest week ever . I'm not digging this trend . 
<<< fool . Goodnight intranets . 
I want love in the afternoon 
Oh , fml . 
I never thought I'd say this , but I can't wait to get back to work ! I feel like a bag of ass , and haven't left the house or slept in three days . BALLS ! 
Someone help me track down some 8mm film . I've had these old video cameras sitting around forever . I've been dying to use them but they just sit here collecting dust . 
I'm still here ; I'm still alive

I eat pieces of shit like me for breakfast 
My heart isn't just a convenience ; please don't waste my time . 
A terrified and wet little puppy beagle just wandered into my garage to indulge in Angels of Light records , smoke cigarettes and enjoy the rain and thunder from a safe distance . 
I'm wide awake and ancy . I think I'm going to take a midnight ride out ' round the Las Sendas loop and back . It could do the soul some good . 
Yeeep . The volume just went out on my tv , so Las Sendas it is ! I have to be up at 5 to run the irrigation anyways - Sleep be damned ! 
Those men aren't men at all 
Iiiiiii wanna beeeeeeee a little seahorse 
refining the fine < PROPMALE > of social repelling 
I want you to go put on your Microphones ' Mount Eerie ' vinyl over a pair of decent studio style headphones , turn off all the lights and enjoy one of the most blissful moments you'll ever have sober and/or dressed . Ohhgosh . Several years later and it is still just as magic as it was the first time . 
insomnivore , rawr . 
I rode aproximately 46mi yesterday . It felt great to finally put in some decent < PROPMALE > . I've been slacking the last few months and haven't been doing hardly any riding other than the daily commute . I did the last 12 or so home from scottsdale with < PROPFIRST > from < PROPFIRST>'s little < PROPFEMALE > dig around 4am . Oh what a night . And now I have to go to work . And this part I'm no so stoked on . 
I want to go out and do something tonight , but I really don't feel like going to a party . Pretty burnt out on all that already . Probably riding out to Tempe . Texteth me . 
+1 epic rides ; -2 chaffing 
I'm making my way back into the AIM scene . So gimme your screen name and/or get at me : dharmaslob 
Yyyyep , Friday night . This . is . the . life ? 
Just watched that show ' Southland . ' It's sooo good ! Kind of reminds me of ' The Wire . ' Obviously it's not as good as ' The Wire ' and it's a little more calm since made for basic television , but as far as standard television goes , it's pretty impressive . And now : Sixteen Candles ! 
Strangerrrsss in the niiiiight 
I live for saturday NPR programming . 
So the other day I requested to have my mind blown , and I think it just happened . In a round-a-bout way ... Unfortunately it wasn't a female , but a molecule that blew my mind . More specifically , a picture of a single molecule . A PICTURE OF A SINGLE MOLECULE ! Jesus . This is incredible/exciting/baffling . 
I still NEEED the new Mount Eerie and Wilco albums ! None of you bought me birthday presents . Get to it ! Both in vinyl if possible , please and thank you . 
I just ran into < PROPFEMALE > at Starbucks a little while ago , which was pretty ironic since I just talked to her on here two days ago for the first time in ages ! It was brief , but nice . Though I was a little caught off guard . Hope I wasn't tooo awkward . Sorry ! haha . On another note , I think I'm going to be riding out to Tempe here in a little bit . What's happenin ? 
I've run into so many people from my past over the last month , most being with other people from my past who back then had absolutely no association . It's pretty wild . I'm pretty sure that the world is shrinking . I downloaded the Tarantino soundtrack discography today . I've decided that I'm going to use the Death Proof tracklist as the soundtrack for my life over the next week or so . It's sooo damn good ! 
What a rush 
Definately , this is the wrong place to be . There's blood on the futon ; there's a kid drinking fire . 
Who's idea was it to answer tweets over the screen of my fringe episode ? I know I've seen it before , but it's still extremely distracting and frustrating ! 
Completely broke , and stuck at home while everyone else went to flagstaff . As much as I love rain , I really hope it doesn't keep up like this all weekend , otherwise I'm stuuuck riiiight here . For once , rejoining the driving community kinda sounds like a good idea . I am not looking forward to this extended weekend at all . 
I'm alone at work and can't leave since I don't have the alarm codes . So far I've given up on my only part I have to work on , < PROPMALE > it from my cap , then attempted to balance it on my head . < PROPFIRST > what was supposed to be a self portrait . Tore it up . Burnt it . I hammered three nails into my desk . Pulled two out , and I just finished TP'ing the bathroom . Which I will now go clean up . And possibly do again . 
I just acquired a large stack of new-to-me records from my mom's cousin . So many fantastic albums in great condition including < PROPMALE > - Bringing It All Back Home , The Beatles - < PROPFEMALE > Road , < PROPMALE > Young and Crazy Horse - Everybody Knows This Is Nowh ... ere , Hendrix - Are You Experienced , Arlo Guthrie - < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant , a couple < PROPMALE > Goodman albums , a very impressive < PROPMALE > and Garfunkel collection and quite a bit more ! 
If trends go in cycles it's time for powdered wigs to make a come back . 
If you could see me now , so sexy in my bandana , cutoff tee , with old oversized tool belt from the construction days . Overkill never looked so good . Got my hammer in one hand , pry bar in the other , and two door frames that must come down . SATURDAY MORNIN ' DEEEMMMOOOLLLIITTTIIIOOOONNNN !!!!!!! This calls for a proper < PROPFIRST > Jonestown Massacre soundtrack . 
Seriously though . Look down at that last post . Cyclismorgasmic . That is one sexy piece of bike . 
just cut my steerer tube to drop my stem about an inch . Gained atleast 10 horses , easy . 
Ahhhhh . I'm soooo hungry ! I can't wait to get home for dinner . Home made French Dip sammmmmiches ! Can'tan'tan'tan't wait ! 
Watching Point Break , again . This time in loving memory of the Swayyyze . Next up : Roadhouse . 
On a positive note , I'm currently in the process of rediscovering the beautiful music of Feist . I need a new job . I could also use a new book to read . I miss going sailing . I've decided to go back to school and pursue a career somewhere in the broad field counseling/therapy . I'm really craving a churro at the moment . I've moved from Feist to < PROPFEMALE > Fitzgerald . Last but not least , as official as it is rare , I am drank . 
' Surrealistic Pillow ' never fails to amaze me . 
aahhh , heading in to work on noooo sleep . This is going to be a long day . 
I need a new book to read and some intellectual stimulation . I feel like my brains wasting away . I'm losing what little edge I had 
From McClintock and Southern to Brown and < PROPMALE > in 35 minutes . Including hitting mostly red lights . My knees hate me . But my cadence was impressive ! 
fourty hours of sleep deprivation , plus three espresso shots are causing an odd dizziness . My head feels like it's been stuffed with steel wool , my limbs are tingling , and shadows are beginning to stalk around my peripheral vision . Oh my . 
All day today I've been thinking it was Sunday . Slowwwwest saturday ever . Is anything happening this evening ? At all ? 
Anyone have any < PROPFIRST > Miller books I could borrow ? Sharing is caring . 
I really need to get back in school . My english has really been slipping , my vocabulary is shrinking , and my wit just isn't quite what is use to be . I don't need to be anything special , but at the same time I have a crippling fear of becoming painfully average . 
I'm feeling kind of radioactive 
Since I will never see any of my promised raises , I've decided to take the initiative of changing my official job title to \Minimalist . \ " New job : day one . " 
Thank you to the wind gods for finally traveling south ! It's been a much welcomed break from fighting head winds on my way to work . Not that the wind here is ever really that bad , but it is definately refreshing . Added 10 horse power easy ! Off to work now , I'm a littttle late . Go listen to Your Heart Breaks . She'll make you smile . 
Zombie Land was so much better than I thought it would be . And I had high hopes . Go see it . You'll hate yourself if you don't . I've got people that will see to it . ChaChaCha ! 
If you don't get the Sundance Channel , chances are you're missing out on the wonders of ' Green Porno . ' But don't worry , my next couple posts will help fill you in . 
Sharpen your teeth , or lay flat . 
I've been slacking on this facebook business over the last couple weeks . Wifi hotspots on Upsilon Andronema b are few and far between . 
sunday , cruddy sunday 
My phone is turned off until tomorrow . So if anyone has sent me texts and I haven't replied , this is why . Quit'cher cryin'! 
I had plans set all week , and it all fell apart last minute ! So here I am stranded deep within the putrid bowels of Mesa for another night . I've got a decent amount of money burning a hole in my pocket , but in order to get anywhere good I have to ride atleast 8 < PROPMALE > . Normally I don't mind but my legs feel like they're full of silica sand and my brain with Knotts < PROPFIRST > Farms Red Rasberry Jelly ( with the seeds in it ) . 
I think I might just rely on the close proximity of Chuys this evening . A short little ride to find out the current exchange rate of the USD to Makers < PROPFIRST > . 
I lost my phone in the bowels of a Goodwill parking lot today . It was my last means of contact with facebook and the world , so it is going to put a damper on what's left of my humble social life . I might activate my old phone tomorrow , but it is next to useless . If someone buys me a new Cricket phone for Christmas I will let you spoon and watch a movie with me . I think that's fair trade for a $250 phone . 
New Years partying put on hold on account of rebellious wall jumping dog . \ 
I forgot how shitty it feels when your dog runs away . \ 
Or I'm just a pusssssy . \

But seriously , who has my dog ? 
What is this 1:22 seed : peer ratio ?! \ 
I'm poor , impatient , and I need my Logic packs/plugins ! Dagnabbit ! \

I guess we just bought the desired software . \ 
How silly ... 
@ home , sickickickick . Kind of . Watching Paper Heart . I thought about going to work , but figured staying home and watching movies would be much more productive towards accomplishing my days goals : mental , spiritual , emotional and such personal sorts of growth , from the comfort and safety of my bed . 
the dog is emitting awful scents that are really interfering with my comfort goals . This is off to a very bad start .

Filing Taxes/Watching \Thumbsucker \"" 
Last year I recieved $200+ return on my taxes . This year I earned 3k more , and paid considerably more in taxes , yet this time I somehow OWE the feds $14 and the state $187 . So much for paying off a < PROPMALE > or two . GET YR HANDS OUT ' MY POCKETS ! AGH ! I am so fjsdhhking sick of money . 
And with that one simple post I have ruined any remaining < PROPMALE > I may have had left of having a relationship with any female currently on my friends list ! 
Just road home from work on my unofficial extended lunch break . Now I can't pry myself out of this chair . Work is the pits . 
I need suggestions on a new phone . Something with a touchscreen AND a flip or slide out QWERTY keypad . I'm caving in and finally joining the ranks of the technosexual revolution . 
Dear Saturday , we've really got to stop meeting like this . 
The best books of our lives have not been written yet . 
Oh , come on . You don't really care about foooootball . 
Only the USA Network would produce Law and Order spots to try and make the show appear sexy . SVU ? Really ? 
Like a puppy romping through a field of < PROPFEMALE>'s , and ' Your Heart Breaks ' songs , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>' girlfriend in ' Pulp Fiction ' holds strong up there amongst the worlds list of cutest things ever . 
Oh ! The daily grind . Commute ; I shall dominate thee . 
I have a feeling the gnome that has been stealing my socks for years recently graduated from the laundry pile to my bookshelf .

Ahh , meditation and lucid dreaming- I've missed you so . 
WIRETAP ! NPR Saturdays are the best . 
Does anyone have any Woods albums ? Anyone want to swap records ? My ears crave something new , or atleast new to me . 
Sir Alnas is coming to pick me up . < PROPFIRST>'s birthday toniiiiiiigggght-ah ! Chyes . 
Work in a few hours ? I'm in no shape . 
Life is so vicious to the most undeserving people . Leaves me with an awful sort of survivors guilt . 
I saw a man on my commute to work today wearing a fully legit Jedi robe . As much as I can't stand < PROPFEMALE > Wars , it totally made my day . 
In the grips of a serious insomnia binge . I miss the days when it didn't faze me . I've only been getting , at best , three hours of sleep for the last six days . It's become almost impossible at times to keep my eyes open at work , yet once I'm home I get an odd second wind and can't seem to sleep . If I don't manage to fall asleep by 4am , I will be utterly useless tomorrow at work . My apologies in advance , hombre's . 
My mom got me hooked on that new show ' Parenthood . ' Tonight they ended the show playing Devendra Banharts - \Foolin ' . \ " Weeeeiiiirrrrd . " 
FMLASDJKHASDHJAKFML ! Self preservation is a natural instinct in all mammals , right ? There's no good way out of this . 
Hurry up and wait . It's for the best , I know , but I'm still so nervous . Let's just get this over with so I can restart my life . C'MON! C'MON! C'MON! 
Dear < PROPFIRST > Noory , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > entrusted you with his child . Coast to Coast was handed down to you in good faith that you would take good care of it , and stay true to the format that made the show a pioneer in broadcasting . But no , instead , you shat all over it . Therefore I am requesting a public apology to < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > for the desecration of his legend , followed by an immediate resignation . With all due respect , < PROPMALE > . 
The world feels very eerie tonight . 
So I'm looking for parts to fix up mama bears beach cruiser in a classic simple style , but 90% of the parts out there these days are for those hideous brocruiser abominations . < PROPMALE > sigh . 
But lets cast away the dogma and the generality , all pervating this good lords land where the finest bitches be . 
The new Cocorosie album is growing on me . But what's with this production nonsense ? Bass EQ's ? Caught me a bit off guard , but now I dig it . Sort of sounds as if < PROPFEMALE > Newsom and < PROPMALE > had their < PROPFEMALE > paws all over it , accompanied by some Sneaker Pimps-esque beats behind the beautifully harsh lyrics and vocals in classic/shameless Cocorosie form . Last night I was disappointed- tonight it really hits the spot . 
Chyes ! < PROPFIRST>'s in town ! It shall be a great night . 
A comfortable and refreshing evening . 
Anyone going to the bike saviours benefit party tonight ? 
I don't need a job ; I'll live off the land . 
I'm going to file for a starving artist < PROPMALE > . If that fails I'll try starving scientist . Then maybe monk or clergy , and so on down the line . Somethings gotta slip through the cracks eventually , right ? Right . 
Oh , dear god . 
I swear , I've had less free time since I lost my job . Now , off to redo all the wiring on the trailer . Good clean fun . 
Just opened a checking/savings account at TCF Bank ! Why I chose a smaller bank mostly based in the midwest , I do not know . Actually , no . I do know . It's because they paid me $100 to do it . They seduced me . Take notes , ladies . Wah wah waaaaaaah . 
< PROPMALE > sigh . 
The last song is about a rooster who ain't alive no mo ' . 
I can't wait till all this is over , with a little money in my pocket , I'm out of this state . 
Finished the ' Outlaw Bible of American Essays ' yesterday and am now working on the ' Outlaw Bible of American Poetry . ' Despite the obnoxious names , they have put together an awesome compilation of assorted works and excerpts from different writers , musicians , artists , etc .. I'm halfway into the poetry one , so someone should buy the ' Outlaw Bible of American Lit . ' for me . I'll repay the favor with a sincere hug ?

Riding to mill and back with my cousin Tiff today to prep her for her first tri ! Chyes ! I need to go buy a new jersey . Cycling shorts and t-shirt just look even more goofy . 
Just changed my FB language to Pirate . I'm not sure if I dig it or not yet . Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a Pirate . 
It'll put color in your cheeks 
And as cool as that is , I'm too broke to keep dying this way 
I'm pretty sure God just set my face on fire . For what , I do not know .

That was rough . 
Unanimous decision : fix/sell the korg , mtn bike , drums , and < PROPFEMALE > car and find myself a new town . asap . 
I sure wouldn't mind sleeping a little tonight 
I've never been a fan of < PROPFEMALE > Trek , but < PROPMALE > Nimoy is awesome on Fringe . 
Night swimming , ftw . 
National Bike To Work Day ? 1:260 work days/yr ? That's not awareness , that's plain ol ' laziness . Regardless , you should probably bike to work today . 
< PROPFIRST > D . < PROPFIRST > + < PROPFIRST > Cunningham = Holyfugginawesome . I forgot how incredible this video was . And of course , Aphex Twin is always brilliant . 
There is a moth on my monitor that I've been chasing around the screen with my cursor for the last few minutes . This is seriously entertaining ! 
We will use our mind powers to collapse the walls 
Boredom is in alliance with the devil . I'm sure of it . 
Ahhhh whadda-bummer ! I've missed all of the Tour of California footage so far this year ! Seriously slacking over here . I need to step up with the extra $5/mo for a dvr ! I'm always slow a couple years behind the technology bandwagon . 
One of my neighbors has this mean spirited late 80's Oldsmobile that gets it's kicks a couple times every month by blasting it's horn at ungodly hours of the night . Either they are all inconsiderate and lazy , or just solid sleepers because this goes on for a good hour (+) before somebody finally awakes and disconnects the battery . I'm about to go do it myself , like the kind hearted samaritan I am . 
\I come not to bury poetry\ 
Astral projection ? Yes , please .

Uggggh . I'm trying to pay my phone < PROPMALE > so I can get my service turned back on , but my phone keeps dropping the call ! 6th times a charm ? 
I powered through that carton with superhuman strength . \ 
My lungs must love me for it .

I opened a box of club crackers this morning , and just finished ' em off . Delicious salt topped parallelograms of buttery goodness , straight from the womb of the great Greek Goddess of Starch- GIMME MORE ! 
Are all government organizations as unreliable as the DES ? If so we're worse off than I thought . 
What a great night . 
I'm FINALLY getting back together with Christian again , back behind the drumset and for the first time in ages to play a show in Tempe ! If I knew when or where I'd totally tell you . When I find out I'll totally tell you . 
We are playing for some quaint event at this little boutique that Christians friend owns . So we will be providing the soundtrack while everybody does their thing . Still have no idea where it's at though . Haha 
Christian and I are playing again tonight . Across the street from Modified , just to the west of 3rd st ! First little driveway on the north . Two more sets and then us . Chyes'r . 
I had the greatest dream last night , followed by the worst dream ever , but the first seriously over powered the latter . Came out of nowhere . I like to think its an omen of sorts . You were in it ! No , not you . If you think its you it probably isn't . Quite the contrary , if you assume its not you there's a better < PROPMALE > it was you .. I assume . rambleRambleramble . 
Let's try this again ;\ 
Hello Life . 
At this rate , my generosity and trust in people will be the death of me . 
If anybody knows how to get in contact with < PROPFIRST > Stincic please let me know asap . 
I've been slacking waaaay too much when it comes to cycling the last couple months . \ 
However , I just finished a decent refreshing 25 mile ride ' round Mesa/Gilbert . The only downside was the plethora of ungodly smells scattered around the majority of Mesa , but the weather is beautiful tonight/this morning . \ 
I really need to get back on a some-what regular training schedule . 
Nick/Allie/Billiams apartment warming party toniiiiight-uh ! \

< PROPMALE > Drake , all day . 
I'm in love . 
Anyone in the Mesa area heading out to Yucca tonight to see Hooves/Poem , or just heading out to the Tempe area in general that would be able to help me out with a ride , please text me . \ 
I can throw in a few bucks for gas and a sincere hug . \

So , with my phone out of commission , I've been borrowing my mothers phone . However , the other day , I irresponsibly left it somewhere . And somewhere down the line someone else took it . They won't answer my calls , and they've already changed the ring back tone twice . I have a decent lead on who it is which is the only reason I haven't shut it off yet ; ( cont . in first comment ) 
Word to the streets ? 
I'm taking my life back from here on out . \ 
God bless you Christian Reeb for making this possible . 
Going for a walk on main street . \ 
Maybe engage in a deep conversation with a Lady of the Night . \ 
Or get mugged by a wild pack of whiskey fueled vagabonds . \ 
Wish me luck . 
Somebody come < PROPFEMALE > out ! \ 
Gawdammit ! \ 
I really need to get a phone again . 
slept from 2-4 , and as beautiful as the sunrise was , I wish that I could say I welcome it . 
Got a carton of reds , and my life is nearly complete . Now all I need is a tub of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and some Club Crackers and I can die a happy man . 
Mutual Appreciation is one of my all time favorite films . \ 
If you have Netflix , I highly recommend you get on it right now . \ 
That , or any other < PROPFIRST > Bujalski film you can find . \ 
Or < PROPFIRST > Katz , or < PROPFIRST > Swanberg . Similar styles , and all , in my opinion , wonderfully refreshing breaks from typical cinema . \ 
Soooooo I've successfully squandered another Saturday night at home . \ 
But I can't complain ; I am strangely satisfied . 
P . S . \ 
I'll probably be doing the same thing next Saturday , so I'm now taking applications for company . Submit a resume , along with a brief cover letter with a few personal details . Example : \ 
* how you prefer to fancy up yr popcorn ( salt : butter ratio)\ 
* general estimate of time spent talking during a film\ 
* how long you can go without a cigarette\ 
* how well you double as a pillow\ 
* etc . \

So tomorrow at two o'clock I've got an hour long session with a psychic . I'm so excited , yet terribly nervous . It's been over 6 years since I last talked to a legit psychic and the last time I failed to fully acknowledge some of what she had to tell me , and have paid for it deeeeaarly . \ 
I am going to take things quite a bit more seriously this time around . \ 
Wish me luck (?) \

I've finally found myself a new lover . Her name is Corynn , and for a mere twenty bucks she was mine , thanks to the local Goodwill store . \ 
She's not much to look at , but once you get your fingers on her there's no denying the bliss that comes from such smooth key-stroking . I'll admit , she's no Selectric , but Smith Corona haven't failed me yet , and this XD5500 \Memory Typewriter\ " is no exception . "

On the bright side : despite my phone service having been shut off for the last four months , the internet is strangely working on it . I have no idea how or why , but i'm just gonna roll with it . 
Guess who paid their phone bill ?!? \ 
Unfortunately they gave away my old number since it was off for so long . And somewhere along the line the microphone on my phone kicked the bucket , rendering calls rather useless- so it's text-only for the moment .. \ 
I need all of your < PROPFIRST > again , \ 
so text me with your name so I can save ' em all again . \ 
480-274-0700\ 
With love , \ 
Once more , I got my phone turned back on , but I had to get a new number . \ 
I need everyone's < PROPFIRST > though , so text me with your name or whatever you wish , at 480-274-0700 . \ 
Also , over it's months of inactivity the microphone broke , so I can only text right now . Get at me muchachos . 
Sprouts is a beautiful place . \ 
Just bought a wonderfully cheap six pack of Shiner Black Lager . \ 
I was relieved from babysitting duty a couple hours early , \ 
so I'm taking full advantage of this freedom today . \ 
Albeit drunkenly . \ 
What's going on today ? 
Being broke is the pits ! \ 
Especially when you are offered a < PROPMALE > G5 for $350 . \ 
And you only have to pay part of it up front ! \ 
Someone , < PROPFEMALE > me 175bones . 
My bike's built back up ! Though out of desperation to ride again it looks like someone vomited mismatch stock parts all over an eighth inch frame set with a hideous chromed out boner stem , which is basically what happened . But what the hell- at least I'm on the road again ! \ 
It's no TK1 , but it rides better than most the halfassed conversions rolling around Tempe these days , so I can't complain . \ 
Time for a ride . 
what's going on tonight ? 
Daaaaaamn . \ 
uTorrent is running flawlessly for me today . \ 
1.8 mb/s ! A new personal record ! haha\ 
I've never been past the kb/s rate . \ 
Hecks yes . 
Hello G5 , I think am in love with you . \ 
Already got Logic Pro , and Photoshop CS5 up and running \ 
and I'm currently working on Ableton Live 8 . \ 
God bless < PROPMALE>'s . I wish I could have made this transition years ago . \ 
Now I just need a good bike-cad program . 
They hardly make it through the door and the sarcastic , backhanded , thinly-veiled family slander contest is already underway ! \ 
My the most ignorant family believe they've won ! \ 
God bless this holiday . 
As annoying and frustrating as this years Thanksgiving ordeal may have been , it was awesome to see my cousin R.J. since I only get to see him once a year . ( Of course the only decent one in that side of the family had to move to Delaware ) Plus , he left me with eight Stone IPA's and a pricey bottle of red wine that nobody got to . \ 
Tomorrow night I shall be the conqueror of them all ! \ 
Like a viking . 
How did the new Kanye album get a 10.0 on Pitchfork ? \ 
I've tried listening to it all the way through to understand , but I just can't . For Kanye , it's pretty good , especially when compared to his last album ; but it is nowhere near a 10 rating . \ 
( continued in first comment ) 
At the DES office . All I have to do is show them my birth certificate . I go to the window to get my number , 78 , just as they're calling 17 . I've been here 1 1/2 hrs and i've still got 37 < PROPFIRST > to go . I'm pretty sure this place served as the blue print for hell . 
Pretty much everyone who has passed me in this building over the last couple hours has had their own unique yet equally putrid smell . A morbidly obese woman just backed into me nearly knocking me over and taking my space . She didn't even notice . Nine more < PROPFIRST > to go . 
Why does IFC keep interrupting my movie with commercials ?! \ 
And when did they start doing this ?!?! \ 
Who told them that is okay ? \ 
Because I promise you , it's not . \ 
THIS IS\ 
COMPLETELY\ 
UNACCEPTABLE !!! 
And so love goes ... And so life goes ... And so I go ... And so I go . 
Ah , rediscovering how great \The Ballad of < PROPFIRST > and Rose\ " is . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Ferlinghetti - Poetry As Insurgent Art\ 
Easily the best purchase I've made in a long time . \ 
Get on it now . \ 
That means you , Nikolai Stepanovich 
Seriously though , we're only days from Christmas \ 
and I am in need of a Selectric II or III . \ 
Who is in the giving spirit ?! 
I just heard a commercial on the radio refer to the upcoming holiday as ' Giftmas ' . I don't think I've wanted to hit the radio so hard since the last time I heard < PROPFIRST > Beck spewing from it . 
yeah , its snowing in my backyard . 
Why is it that Shannyn Sossamon's death in ' The Order ' only made me fall in love with her even more ? \ 
Is that unnaturally morbid ? \ 
So be it . 
Drinking my morning coffee I managed to swollow in a way that I never have before . ( Nor am I able to repeat- believe you me , I've tried ) For a brief moment I had to drop everything to figure out whether or not I had literally just inhaled it . \ 
This probably isn't important enough to warrant a fb post . I was just surprised to find that in the almost 25yrs I've commanded this vessel , I've never done THAT . 
I am officially an enrolled student of English and Psychology . The me I knew a few years ago would never believe me when I say : I am so excited to go back to school ! I finally look forward to taking English , writing , and jurnalism classes , and with my growing fascination with < PROPFIRST > over the last several years , I am even eager to take math classes- despite having to start from the humble basics again ... Hah ! 
sunglass hut is playing Camera Obscura ! I haven't listened to this in years . Feels like high school love ! 
Is it Tuesday yet ? 
taking our seats for el Greeeen Hornet at the local cinemachzech , riiiiiiiight NOW ! You best not be fixin ' t'disappoint us , < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPFIRST > Gondry directed the SHIT out of < PROPMALE > Green Hornet ! \ 
And that , folks , is my elegant review . \ 
His style was very prominent through the entire film , \ 
and had it been directed by anyone else , \ 
It surely wouldn't have been nearly half as good . \ 
It certainly won my recommendation . 
< PROPFIRST > D . < PROPFIRST > & I Care Because You Do ; \ 
all night , repeat = \ 
?, please . 
Dear Lord , thank you for this day so that I may put on my collected Wiretap and This American Life podcasts and curl back up in my bed for a few more hours . \ 
Thaaaanks , God ; you are teh coolest ! \ 
Amen . 
First class of my late-blooming college career . \ 
Bring it . 
I'm bored and I can't fall back asleep , so I've decided that I need to get out and actually do something today . \ 
What's going on ? 
Going out rather aimlessly around Tempe and Phx . \ 
Text me if you are free and wanna go do something ! \ 
480-274-0700 
I partially retract one of my more recent posts . American television producers don't shit on every sitcom they steal from over seas . They have actually done justice with Showtimes new version of ' Shameless ' . I was a bit skeptical when I heard about it , since I never like the original much , anyhow . I must admit I'm impressed . ' Shameless ' with < PROPFIRST > H . < PROPFEMALE > may soon rank right up there with ' Weeds ' . 
Showing up all the kids at Chandler skatepark ! \ 
Hah , no .. Not really . There's a 6yr old kid getting lessons from this other cat and I'm pretty sure he's making me look bad . And in this moment , I would like to propose a toast- to humbling experiences ! 
Vanilla < PROPMALE > = Delicious . \ 
God bless you , Sprouts . 
At British Open with < PROPFIRST > and Drewski , chyeees sir ! 
The casual cruelty of well-meaning strangers . 
I'm thinking about cheating on my bike . Not leaving her- I could never do that- but I'm breaking down and buying a car . Being the poor man I am , I only have $2500 to work with right now , but I'm not too fond of Escalades anyhow . \ 
If anyone knows of/has a decent & cheap vehicle for sale , or have any leads what-so-ever that help me become mobile again , I will kiss you . \ 
Whether you like it or not . 
So , I finally did it- I bought myself a truck today . Now , you are surely asking yourself , \I wonder what color truck he bought ...? \ " \ 
I forgot how good the Emergency Room scene of Jesus ' Son is . Haha \ 
Speaking of movies , I need to read this book again . 
Magik Markers all day , \ 
Growing all night , \ 
Alright ! 
Watching The Last Exorcism . \ 
Don't worry , I didn't pay for it . 
Good times . \ 
Yeah , \ 
good times . 
Heading out to paint this town more of an auburn , or maybe rust . \ 
I'm getting rather sick of red . 
Off Beat Cinema on that RTV channel is easily the best thing about Sunday Nights . 
Deerhoof vs . Evil 
So much to do , \ 
such a short attention span . \ 
To the bike shop to blow a little money , \ 
then off to explore the city scape , \ 
one poor neglected bike < PROPFIRST > at a time . \ 
Also , my phone is back on \ 
so text me if you are around Mesa/Tempe/Chandler\ 
maybe we can meet up and drown our sorrows in coffee . 
Somebody just shouted my name at me from a silver/grey hatchback on southern . \ 
WHO ARRRREEE YOOOUUU\ 
HOOLIGANS ? \ 
And what do you want\ 
with my soul ?!?! 
As luck might have it , it's Fat Tuesday . Is anybody out and about ? I could use a ride home eventually . I'll serenade you to sleep . Or buy you a drink ? 
My bartender(ess ? ) looks like liv < PROPFIRST > and an epic linebacker had a daughter .. \ 
Had a WNFL existed she'd surely be their Hall of Fame pride & joy . 
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhohmy . \ 
God bless you , Andrew ;\ 
the patron saint of long lost hopeless drunks ! 
“Who knows how to make love stay ? \ 
Tell love you are going to the < PROPMALE>'s Deli on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to pick up a cheesecake , and if love stays , it can have half . It will stay . 
VIP treatment in all the hottest soup kitchens 
My sleep cycle says \Good morning ! \ " \ 
I hope that someday when I have a child she emerges from the womb with Burroughs voice . 
I need a new typewriter . \ 
The CIA/NSA/FBI/PBS obviously snuck in through my phone < PROPFIRST > in the middle of the night and obviously adjusted the motor hum from my beloved Smith Corona to a frequency that cancels out any brain function once the power switch is turned on . \ 
So buy me a new typewriter , \ 
and a one way ticket to ... \ 
somewhere . 
Fiiiinally ! I have an appointment in a few hours to finish everything up and hopefully get my license back ASAP ! \ 
I can't wait to be done with all of this nonsense and be mobile once again ! \ 
The neighbors are probably wondering why I've been sitting in my truck making engine noises . 
Why are there so many people online right now ? \ 
Don't any of you slackers have jobssss ??? \ 
Buh-dun , tisssssssss . 
Toooooooo drunk to handle public transit right now 
Seriously though . 
I'm thinking about legally changing my name to Kilgore Trout 
Ah yessss , \ 
Vanilla porter .... \ 
I knew we'd meet again . 
I almost posted\ 
\I think my house is haunted ... \ " \ 
Slept outside last night and woke up to this perfect weather ! Making it a perfect morning for a walk ! \ 
No , I'm not homeless . 
I love opening up my notebooks and finding other peoples handwriting . \ 
Apparently nobody takes this < PROPFEMALE > when they are sober , but that's okay . \ 
Deciphering the message is half the fun anyhow ! 
I need a suit . 
The greater part of my diet consists of Kraft < PROPMALE > & Cheese , Eggo's , and grilled cheese sandwhiches ... \ 
I'm such a child . \ 
I love it . 
The MVD really needs to hurry up with this snail-mail approval process , because ;\ 
a . I'm sure everyone is pretty sick of these posts already\ 
b . I am growing more and more impatient by the day\ 
c . I could desperately use a refreshing camping session- if even for one measly Saturday night ! 
< PROPFEMALE > shoot the apple off my head\ 
I need to go to the store\ 
to get some sleep . \ 
' Cause I've run out'a sleep ! \ 
bah\

bum bah bum\

This American Life , FTW ! 
So if I'm awake here shortly once this movie ends\ 
I think I will stroll on up to Chuy's for a bit . \ 
Anyone gonna be there tonight ? 
Home sweet home . \ 
I can finally sleep in tomorrow . Which means I'm not sleeping yet . \ 
Whats happenin' ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Sinatra , or < PROPFIRST > Holiday ? I'll take ' em both . 
Is anyone still up at this hour ? Come partake in a sleep deprived sunrise session with coffee on the side . \ 
Crunk is dead ;\ 
Let's get jittery . 
I picked the wrooong day to quit sniffing glue . 
holyfuckinggoddamnimapieceofshit . \ 
< PROPFIRST > , you have every right to shoot me . \ 
I will eat your tumor . \ 
I don't expect that act to actually make up for anything , or even commence any sort of forgiveness process , but it still feels necessary . 
Seeeriously though , go watch it . \ 
Though he only has a supporting roll , it has one of < PROPFIRST > Walkens best comedic roles ever . \ 
EVER !

NUTELLA\ 
Y RITZ ! \ 
binge . binge . binge . \ 
Then maybe a bike ride . I've been neglecting my bike a lot lately- even more so than I have facebook . And while I consider the decreased Facebook activity a plus , I'm starting to get really out of shape again due to this cycling void . It might also have something to do with the strict diet of reds , Nutella , Ritz , Pepsi , and alcohol . \ 
... Nah , that's absurd .

This is fucking stupid . \ 
( Just throwing that out there . ) 
So I still don't know where I'm getting rowdy tonight for < PROPMALE > birthday . So far I'm thinking either Yucca , or The Lodge in Scottsdale . Opinions or other suggestions ? \ 
Wherever it is , come join me . That means every one of you . \ 
I wanna see old and new faces , err'wherr .

So tonight I am riding my bike to ' your ' house to drink ' your ' drinks ! \ 
So ... who are you ? 
Couldn't sleep , but it is gorgeous outside . Morning ride ' round Tempe/Scottsdale and back ? I think so . \ 
Maybe Las Sendas .. because I've been slacking the last few months , and I certainly haven't tortured myself enough lately . \ 
FPL , FTW . 
I've been reading the last several hours and my poor eyes need a break . I want to get wild on some Words With Friends , but everyone is slacking tonight ! \

I need to get out and do something . This whole broken down truck situation is bad for my health- I'm quickly becoming a recluse again . What's everyone doing today ? Someone , save me from myself- puhleeease ?
