Rejoice in the creative spirit that lives in you . Use it consciously to create the life and the world you want . -- John < PROPMALE > 
Glad to finally be home after a very long but productive day at the Red Cross . 
Headed back to the office this morning . Perhaps today will be the day I finally get caught up . Hope springs eternal ! 
I've been working on getting a new webpage up and running . Took me a while to get online , but finally got it right ! If you have a moment , check it out http://budurl.com/EnjoyMoreSuccess 
My dear friend < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Henderson is wanting to go to the < PROPFIRST > Awards . She is an actor/young mother of 3 in Orlando/St Cloud FL and also works in the local theatre .

For my Dad on Father's Day . Roses grow in heaven , Lord pick a bunch for me . Place them in my father's arms and tell him they're from me . Tell him that I love and miss him . When he turns to smile , place a kiss upon his cheek & hold him for awhile , because remembering him is easy , I do it every day . There's an ache ... in my heart that will never go away . If your Dad is in Heaven , copy and paste . 
\One place we could always be assured of hugs was on Papa's lap . It was a < PROPMALE > area where we could find security and peace to be found nowhere else . \ " ~ Leo Buscaglia " 
Spent the afternoon and evening at < PROPMALE > Mountain National Park . I feel so blessed to live in Colorado . I never get tired of how beautiful it is here . I hope I never take it for granted . 
You and I wake up in jail together . \

Making potato & corn chowder from scratch with home made cornbread . Perfect for a cold , snowy day ! 
My heart goes out to all the people that have been affected by the devastating Japan earthquake and Tsunami . I just texted REDCROSS to 90999 to donate $10 to support disaster relief to that area . I urge you to do the same . It feels good to know that while we are busy helping here at home , we can still lend a hand on the other side of the world as well ! 
When we stop inventing lies and start inventing the truth of who we are , conscience transforms into inspiration and we create miracles ! 
It has been a very long week . I think I'll go home now . Have a great weekend everyone !
