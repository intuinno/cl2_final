seventeen ... only comes once in a life time ... dont it just fly by wild and free ... going anywhere the wind blows baby ... seventeen .... 

God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change , the courage to change the things i can , and the wisdom to know the difference .... 
anyone can give up , it's the easiest thing in the world to do . but to hold it together when everyone would understand if you fell apart , that is true strength . 
Thanks everyone for the bday wishes !! 
i said leave but all i really want is u to stand outside my window screaming im in love with u wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and dont u leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door 
i'm just another thing u can roll ur eyes at < PROPFEMALE > ... 
who do u think u r running round leavin scars collectin ur jar of hearts tearin love apart
