Happy New Year !!! 

Happy Halloween !!! 
an afternoon of pandora and sewing is not so bad ..... school this evening , however , is a bummer :/ 
it's been a long time since i woke up Oklahoma ..... i forgot how amazing it is :) 
Oklahoma , as always , you have been good to me ... thank you for a great weekend with great friends . 
ummm ... yeah , so boredom has set in and i've been doing some affirmation exercises via FB quizzes ..... turns out i'm a loyal , astute , earthy , otter that enjoys < PROPFIRST > Cusack movies .... sounds about right ;) 
Happy Thanksgiving everybody !!! 
watching the Wizard of Oz with my mom .... and her little dog too :) 
i suspect that Ophie's first christmas , might be the last for my tree and all my shiny sparkly decorations :/ 
ended this semester on a good note ..... now on to the next !... but first a small break :) 
May you all have a safe and Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > !!!
