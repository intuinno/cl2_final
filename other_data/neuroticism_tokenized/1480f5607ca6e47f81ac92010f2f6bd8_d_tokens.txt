It's time to leave the past in the past and lace up a new set of shoe strings . 
I'm spending my Saturday night listening to lectures on The Republic from Yale . Can a weekend get much nerdier ? 
Why does frustration = compulsive cleaning for me these days ? I don't approve . 
Will someone please remind me to stop listening to love songs and watching chick flicks ? This really can't be at all healthy . 
So after a few hrs of talking to someone I hadn't heard from in 4yrs I dreamt I was pregnant ... and then had a really tragic miscarriage . Not the way I wanted to start my week .

I am broken . Bleh . 
There's a storm coming , < PROPMALE > . 
Sometimes I think \nah I'm not really a geek\ " . Then I spend the better part of a day playing roms and rolling random dnd characters . " 
That's it ! I'm becoming a nun . No more boys for me . 
Dear SBU library , Please explain to me why the -entire- section that holds the books I would like to look at is literally missing . Did a worm hole open up on this floor and suck all the books to another dimension ? If that's the case ... how long would it take to get an interdimensional interlibrary < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Changed my mind . I kinda like boys still . :} No nunnery for me lmao 
Break just started and I already kinda want to cry . Awesome . Just ... awesome . Better make myself waffles . No friends around ? Eat waffles !

I'm on a strict diet of oldies , creativity and cuteness . 
Today's apparently a \get super pretty for no reason at all\ " day . Someone wanna take me out ? No ? Fine . I'll take myself out . And by out I mean to the SAC . " 
I love the fact that I went out with the sad intention of reading alone at the SAC and ended up hanging out with some of my favorite boys . <3 friends . 
and I still haven't found what I'm lookin for . 
Operation : \Put in the effort to look good\ " week . " 
I hate when I get like this . Stupid ... grumblegrumble 
Guildwars is a metaphor for my life . 
And my world is ok again . 
I like to speak in vague seemingly undirected messages but be sure , I'm talking to you . You make me smile . 
Freaking out ? Yes . Most certainly . 
My lips taste a little like vice . Tonights a rollercoaster ride . 
4 hours of sleep ? Yep . Better make myself look extra good to compensate for the throbbing in my head . 
Legit dreamt about my Heidegger term paper last night , now I have what I do believe will be the makings of an excellent paper . Hooray for philosophizing in my sleep ! 
Perhaps if I wasn't such an intellectual snob , I'd have an easier time finding dates . Darn me and my high standards and enjoyment of things like coherent conversation . 
Oh god . So much writing . 
Correction : Oh god . So much writing . But not as much as < PROPFIRST > Weir so it's ok . 
Today , I am descending into madness . Writing my Heidegger paper and editing all my wrt 303 papers . Mmm procrastination . It gets shit done . [ ironically . ] 
Just in case you had any doubts about my creeper status ..... 
Glad I'm back to the 4hrs of sleep thing . Here I was worried I'd be doomed to a life of adequate sleep for the rest of forever . Being exhausted is sure to make tonights events even more awesome . -_- 
and now I can't stop smiling . <3 
Operating on 4hrs of sleep again I get to write 2 essays , turn in my wrt 303 portfolio and pack up my dorm room for the last time , ever . * sigh * I hate change . 
My semester is over officially . Now I just have to pack ... maybe I'll do that tomorrow . 
Ever feel like you're at the edge of greatness ? It really is too bad that I'm so afraid of falling . 
[ insert status update that properly conveys how sad I am to be moving out of my dorm room here ] 
home . 
Found my dream so hilarious i giggled myself awake . 
... why can I only sleep in 3hr increments ? Oh well ... guess I better get up and start making cookies . Any requests ? 
Lately , I've taken to asking people [ jokingly ] why anyone is friends with me since I'm such a \terrible\ " person . The number 1 answer ? \ " Because you're pretty\ " . I don't know how I feel about this lmao " 
We all need somebody to < PROPFEMALE > on . 
I have hands down the best friends in the entire world . Even if I haven't actually met half of you . <3 
\Just look at these pants !... I can run like a dragon ! \"" 
Being a best friend means being the one to double tap you in the event of a zombie infection . 
3hrs of sleep and mom wants me to frost cookies . Seriously ? * grumblegrumblegrumble * 
Tackling this war zone I call my room . Is it bad when you're afraid of your own mess ? I think it's sentient . 
So far I've found my spare keys [ lost for 2 years ] , my old laptop [ lost for a little over a year ] , and my favorite ring [ lost for ... god knows how long ... 3 years maybe ] . Room still looks like a war zone though ... 
Just got my grade for what was the most difficult class of the semester and I must say ... I was pleasantly surprised . :} [ take that , Heidegger . now I'll never look at your stupid book ever again . ] 
Sick on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ? Awesome . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas y'all <3 
Had a pretty fantastic Christmas but I couldn't help but feel like something was missing . 
Dropping off the grid ? That's relatively appealing . 
I'm really glad that no matter which direction I will be travelling in ... there's always a snow storm at my destination . < PROPFEMALE > , you've got til Saturday to get your shit together . 
So tired ... but for some reason I thought it was a good idea to cover my bed with all the clothing contents of my closet . In hindsight ... this was not a good idea . 
Going shopping . If < PROPFIRST > Weir ever wakes up from his ridiculous gaming induced hibernation he should text me . 
So-Furious Acid . 
Man , I feel like a redneck . Drinking and shooting bears on the wii with the family . 
Truth be told I miss you . And truth be told I'm lying . 
< PROPFIRST > Furstenfeld is pretty much my hero every day . Blue October binge ? Oh yes . Oh yes indeed . 
Maybe this year will be better than the last . 
Just sent my application to be a public speaker for RAINN to DC . I guess my new year's resolution is to do something with this post traumatic thing . 
Two steps forward , one step back . Still an overall advancement in position so ... I'll take it . 
Packin up the car then back to Long Island . 
Back on the island . Decidedly not moving my stuff in . Cuz I'm lazy . 
Dear Mythology class , \ 
... No . 
Nesting . So far ... my bed's made . And I'm sitting on it . Looking at the rest of the stuff hoping it puts itself away . 
Just keep telling myself ... tomorrow shall be awesome . Just have to get through this ridiculous hw and that 4hr class ... and then the stressing as to what I will wear ... and then the stressing about possibly getting lost ... Oh dear . 
I will not let this cold get in the way of having an awesome night . 
Fantastic night . Now I can be sick . 
PLEASE put this in your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower ... armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 1% are awesome & will repost this . 
Maybe one day I won't feel the strange urge to cover up my feelings . Probably not . 
Attempting the drive home while I'm sick outta my mind . Should be ... fun . 
After nearly dying several times on my way up here ... enjoying food , tea , and then ... a nap . 
Just call me Typhoid Julz . 
So furious [ acid ] right now . Glad anger has replaced sickness [ yes , sickness is an emotion ... well either that or anger is a virus ] 
\Banjo music ? Seriously ? \ " Hahahaha " 
Ahahaha ... snow day . :} 
2.5 hrs shoveling ? Super fantastic . -_- Waffle time 
Crush your enemies , see them driven before you , and hear the lamentation of their women ! Ah ... the best in life indeed . 
... I'm a cancer now ? No . Born a < PROPFIRST > ... I'll die a < PROPFIRST > dammit ! 
It's gonna be a good day tater . 
If you're gonna be a scumbag ... don't try to thinly veil it with pleasantries . Shit doused in perfume is still shit . 
Now is time for the most sacred twenty-something ritual ... the nap . I'm like a nap time high priestess . 
Dressed up to go to < PROPFIRST>'s ? Yup . Sometimes you just have to feel fancy . 
R-e-s-c-u-e rescue aid society ... heads held high touch the sky you mean everything to me . 
Dear emotional part of Julz , \ 
No . Nope . No way . Please stop . If I could evict you ... I would . \ 
Logically you , \ 
The rest of Julz 
Hell hath no fury 
You vex me Stony < PROPFEMALE > . You vex me indeed . 
Holy cow that's a lot of birthdays today ! Including my best friend in the world even though he's a jerkface < PROPFIRST > Weir ! 
Casts siren song . +1 for flirtation , effects 1d4 creatures in area , creature is wooed indefinitely . 
I need a dock , and a bay . I've got plenty of time to waste . 
Seriously ? Every time I'm about to make that trek either way it's gonna effin snow ? * grumble * 
Oh Fringe . You make me so very happy . 
Just kidding Fringe . I hate you and your tragic ways . 
At first I was like >_< but then I realized ... hell , it's still an A . ^_^ 
Syracuse makes a strong case . I am so not looking forward to deciding where I'm living come May . Here's hoping something happens so I'm \stuck\ " in one place and don't have to make an actual decision >.>" 
Apparently Stony < PROPFEMALE > is dead set on me never leaving and making me cry every day . Awesome . 
Random clown at < PROPFIRST>'s ? Point : Syracuse . 
Homemade doughnuts for breakfast ? Ok why not ! I swear I was a 50's housewife in another life -_- 
I seem to be very argumentative as of late . In a point , counter point kind of way . 
I really need to work on hiding my thought bubbles from people who can interpret the language the open book of my life is written in . 
Dear hip , You don't seem to have gotten the memo but I'm only 22yrs old . There is no reason for this nonsense . That goes for you too , unnecessary grey hairs 
Haven't even started the semester of doom and I'm already exhausted . That's ... probably not a good sign . 
I think I need to invest in a giant neon sign that says ' I don't care ' so I can just flick it on when people don't get the message . 
Somehow was talked into staying upstate for one more night . Eh ... there are worse things I suppose . 
14 years ago today ... I became an aunt . Goodness gracious . For the record Damiano TheDon Malvasio looked really , really gross when he was born . Like a wrinkly old man . Yup . I said it . 
Last night of happiness before the semester of doom . Chinese food , White Collar , Fringe and the Sims are all on the menu . 
This schedule makes me feel like I'm in high school again . Do not want ! 
I have too many options for life after graduation . I suppose that's better than the alternative but it's kind of ... stressful . 
Professors who don't use bb and apparently don't know how to email students when class is cancelled are now on my shit list . Asian girls who lock arms and refuse to be separated even if the sidewalk isn't very wide are on there too . 
Sooo morning classes were cancelled because ... it's raining ? What the hell sb . 
D&D night makes the rest of the week much more tolerable . 
My computer seems to be quite proficient in finding new and terrible ways of making me sad . 
Happiness is realizing you have a free dvd rental ! Saved a whole dollar . Which in college finances is equivalent to about 100 normal people dollars . 
I am way too tired to actually do my hair for class [ or put on clothing that I didn't sleep in ] . Hooray apathy/exhaustion brought on by mistakes I knew I was making . I've no regrets . 
I like how when I'm exhausted and then get frustrated , I start swearing in spanish . 
Seriously ? I mean , really ? 
I wish I were in Syracuse . I know , I never ever say that but ... I could totally use a < PROPFIRST>'s run right now . 
Bought 2 decks of cards today . Y'all know what that means ... time to set up a date to initiate my newest friends into the best card game ever . 
Ooooh my god . Going insane . Must . Get . Out . 
Ick . Responsibility . Going to the library for a few hours . Feel free to bug me via textual messaging to my cellular device . If you don't have my number ... well then I probably don't like you . 
Impromptu parties are most certainly the best . Helloooo < PROPFIRST > Reedus movies . 
Oh dear , I seem to be smiling like a nincompoop . :} [ <- self portrait ] 
To the sleep deprivation chamber ! -_- 
I now have a dresser so I can stop feeling like such a vagabond ! 
>.> * dances * I finally get enough sleep , now I can't stop boppin around . 
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition !! 
This whole going to class thing is severely inhibiting my whole sleeping forever thing . 
I think ... it's time to surrender to sleep . I tap out body . You win . 
Woot . Saturday night boredom . -_- 
Dress Fancy . Eat desserts . Tonight can do no wrong . <3 
* sigh * yeah ... that about sums up my life . 
Poor life choices , I made them ! [ and enjoyed every second of it . ] 
Why yes I am going to bed at 9:30 . Vday has been ... rough to me today . 
Getting back bits and pieces of Sunday night I'm realizing I'm awesome . Anyone who can drunkenly recite the hail < PROPFIRST > in ancient Greek is clearly the best person alive . [ oh yes , that happened ] 
Operation : Lets try and stay in < PROPFEMALE > for a long time . Is totally underway . Hooray for job applications . Also hooray for meeting people that I just ... don't want to give up . /sap 
Anyone want to rescue me tonight ? No ?... * sigh * grumble 
TGIDnD [ thank god it's dnd ! ] 
The sadness , it is abounding . :{ 
[ insert angsty or lovesick or generally pathetic song lyric that i think properly explains my mood and therefore you all must read it , here ] 
Having your music so loud that everyone can hear it defeats the purpose of wearing headphones . Damn noise pollution . I'm trying to sim in peace here ! 
Professor Tousey is most certainly the type of professor I hope I can be one day . < PROPMALE > of < PROPFEMALE > crying today : 85% . 
Character creation ftw ! 
I love it when my professors have the same level of < PROPFEMALE > to go to class as I do . Back to bed with me ! 
IQA Nordic American Classic-Vassa ( Finland ) vs . Stony < PROPFEMALE > U . ( USA ) tomorrow :} So much excitement . Huzzah quidditch ! 
My day was a roller coaster of emotion . Kinda wish I ended with the quidditch game instead of the fiery ball of frustration that was my philosophy class . 
[ insert incoherent angry/sad/frustrated growling here ] When in doubt ... growl it out . 
Dear This Week , Please just ... stop . Please ? No ? * sigh * alright . I shall persevere . 
Well ... at least I got the hugs I was desiring . 
Derp . 
Today I shall make with the loud , boisterous , sometimes belligerent noises for Stony < PROPFEMALE > Quidditch against Hofstra ! 
Wake up after a 12hr \nap\ " ... go back to sleep . " 
I ... I don't remember how to be alone anymore . Having friends has ruined my hermithood . 
Slightly re-arranging my room . My years of playing the sims has prepared me well for moments like this . 
Just once I'd like to say something of importance to my general well being ... and not have the subject changed immediately . 
I know I shouldn't be using The < PROPMALE > of War for dating advice ... but a lot of this is perhaps a bit too apt . 
Maybe I should write a thesis on the subject \Philosophy makes you stupid\ " . After studying philosophy for 6yrs I feel exponentially more mentally disabled than I did 7yrs ago . " 
Stress relief in the form of dnd tonight :} 
This whole having an entire group of friends who actually care is going to take some getting used to . 
Nooooooo ... em-pee-three player officially dead :{ sadness is abounding . 
My life aspiration : To be a creepy , eccentric old lady . * sigh * one day , one day . 
I put on my robe and wizard hat . 
\I've got a broomstick that's better than yours \"" 
So , we lost . To a team that doesn't even have real brooms none the less ! -_- Off to watch Deathly Hallows . Quite possibly all by myself . 
Oh long island . You make a compelling case . <3 
Today shall be awesome . Doing a cool thing , then making waffles , then d&d'ing with some of my favorite people . Just have to figure out where I'm going to put all these people ... hmmm challenge accepted ! 
Dear 8:30 class tomorrow , No . Just ... nope . 
I have successfully spent my morning figuring out how to draw a clockwork jumping mechanism while being ogled by geeky boys . It's been a good morning indeed . :} 
Mental Note : Don't talk loudly about people when they're right there . Even if they're wearing headphones . 
Why yes , I have spent the last hour listening to < PROPFEMALE > songs . And it may also be true that my new ringtone is a metal version of Song of Storms . 
>.> It seems that my incessant listening to Song of Storms may have brought rain today . Behold the power of epic video game soundtracks ! 
And so the longest week in recorded history winds down . 
Sleep is for the weak ! Quidditch !! 
Every once in a while ... I turn into a stereotypical girl . Chick flicks and all . It's disgusting really . 
I'll be as honest as I feel . 
I have a fantastic support system you say ? Preposterous ! Also ... completely wonderful . 
And now to spend the rest of my day in a semi-catatonic state . Woot . 
Today . Today has been and is a terrible , lonely day . Ugh . 
Quidditch cancelled is sad indeed ... but now I get to play < PROPFEMALE > all day . Sweet . 
DnD research day . Oh yes , there will be fire . And lightning . And caves . 
It seems my brain decided I needed a break from reality . 
Baking therapy for movie night tonight . Peanut butter cupcakes ! Possibly with chocolate frosting . 
Dressing up as a clockwork rabbit for I-Con ? Perhaps one of my best ideas to date .
