GOOOO Vikings !!! Cheesehead fans , all I have to say to you is ... HAHAHAHA . In all seriousness that was a great friggin game . 

If your Mom is your hero , your best friend or \ 
just the best mother ever , whether you are blessed to have your Mom \ 
still with you , or if she is a angel in Heaven , copy and paste this into\ 
your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Mom and love \ 
her dearly ! 
Just watched Zombieland ... liked it 
Thanks to everyone for the b-Day wishes . 
Happy Ind . Day to everyone , a time to think about what freedom , selflessness , and national pride mean to you . 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim VS . The World ... Watch it . 
home for all of 5 hours and then off to Florida , my job and I have a very tenuous love/hate thing going on . 
was almost 80 here today , normal November Florida weather ? It's been so mild everywhere I am really ready for some winter . 
Either I am pregnant or having early onset mid-life crisis . I am having strange cravings for a sports car and a 21 year old girlfriend . Third option : It may just be bad gas . 
Thanksgiving may be my least favorite holiday . I don't even care for turkey . Unlike New Years , when you get drunk and start crying at the table , people give you stink-eye . Also , I doubt the Native Americans are too thankful . Screw Thanksgiving . 
Seventeen days and I will be on an extended break , oh the anticipation is almost as great as my misguided rage . 
Change\ 
your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To \ 
not see a human face on FB til Monday , Dec . 6 . Join the fight against \ 
child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your friends\ 
to do the same 
I am forgoing pictures on this job , I am in Detroit ... nuff said .

Stark , 22 , < PROPFIRST > Fahey 23 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status 
let's think/pray for all the poor folks caught in this tsunami . I am sure the Japanese people will bounce back . Nevertheless , keep them and the other small islands/Hawaii in your thoughts today .
