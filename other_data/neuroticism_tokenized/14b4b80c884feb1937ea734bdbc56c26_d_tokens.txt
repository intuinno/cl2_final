Today is the fourth , and Uncle < PROPFIRST > and I went indoor skydiving ! What a total rush ! Everyone should do this . Soon . =) Pics included , photography courtesy of < PROPFIRST > . 

Coolest thing ever just happened ! I have confirmed that there is a gamer < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > was being fussy , not wanting to fall asleep , so I rocked him while humming the < PROPFIRST > Bros . theme and he was asleep in minutes . Perfect ! 
found out that my video card is not fried . I even got the dual monitor working again ! 
has learned that the Board of Trustees wanted to make all majors here fit into 120 credits . So , for my math course , they essentially gutted linear algebra , took the remainder of the entrails , and made a haggis of it and differential equations . All in a single semester ! So that's what I've got going for me . =D 
This week's Sudoku in the Scroll was crazy hard > < . 
Wow , I'm surprised eveyone remembered my birthday . Thank you everyone that tuned in ! 
Most epic LoL game yet ! Im Trist , got Veigar and Fiddle on my team . The other two don't count because they left early . So we are down 5v3 about 10 < PROPFEMALE > in . And we still win ! For details email me ! The funniest part is that my teammates considered me the tank . I did tank baron at least ... 
Grrrr . My teammate just ninjad my quadra kill > < 
So I got this new phone for Xmas . It connects to wifi so I can go on the internet when I'm at my local Starbucks . It also makes it easier to keep tabs on FB when I'm not at my PC ( I'm not a laptop person ) . So , I expect my activity will increase . I look forward to keeping in touch with all of you more often . 
We landed in boise . safe and sound . We leave for < PROPMALE > first thing in the morning . 
We are now in IF . < PROPFIRST > wanted to stop at wal mart .
