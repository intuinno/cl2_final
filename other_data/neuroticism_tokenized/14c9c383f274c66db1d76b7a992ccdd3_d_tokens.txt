I might not be the most beautiful or the sexiest woman .. Nor might I have the perfect body .... I might not be a first choice .... But I AM a GREAT choice ... I might not be proud of some of the things I've done ... But I am proud of who I am TODAY ... Take me as I am or don't take me at all ... COPY and POST if you LOVE LIVING YOUR LIFE BEING YOU !!!

It's been awhile since I had a < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera \Dirrty\ " kind of night . Sounds kinda fun ...! " 
Sleep ? SLEEP ? What is that ? Crazy people with your crazy notions about needing sleep . The pink panda in my bedroom says sleep is over-rated and I am inclined to beleive him . After all , he IS a pink panda . His name is Wobbles .... 
Why can't things just be the way they are ? Do things always have to be more difficult than they need to be ?

I guess I kinda lost control , because in the middle of the play I ran up and\ 
lit the evil puppet villain on fire . No , I didn't . Just kidding . I just said\ 
that to help illustrate one of the human emotions , which is freaking out . \ 
Another emotion is greed , as when you kill someone for money , or something like\ 
that . Another emotion is generosity , as when you pay someone double what he\ 
paid for his stupid puppet .

Ever run backwards naked through a corn field ? I don't recommend it ! 
It's the end of the World as we know it , and I feel fine ... 
... and when worse comes to worst , just remember to breathe . You're an adult now , remember ? 
You Win Again , Gravity ! 
Sunshine Disaster and Civilized Animal @ Stage 54 ! Get your asses down here ! 
So , yeah . Before I start whining and feeling sorry for myself , perhaps I should count my many blessings first ... 
I think more than I forget . 
I'm < PROPFEMALE > tonight ... And the designated driver ... Woo 
Smile : it confuses all the right people . 
Eagles may soar , but Weasels don't get sucked into jet engines . 
Almost $400 for snow tires ? A 3 hour wait , with no magazines ? Stranded < PROPMALE > from home , with no sleep , with precious few hours before my 12hr shift ? Sure , why not . Sounds like the perfect end/beginning/end to the the last few days . But OH NO ... I'm not bitter at ALL ... 
I get to go home soon , my real home with my real family . Haven't been there in days ... Much , much too long ! 
Yesterday ... I dropped my phone in a public toliet . 
If ever I needed a sign that shit needs to motherfucking change ... 
There are way too many corners in a round room ... 
feels like my life is a series of WTF moments ... 
Time and Gravity : my mortal enemies , and my bestest friends . 
Why am I always so sad ? Even when I am happy ? I need a hug . When I'm in his arms , it isn't just some hug . It's like going home . I miss my man . I miss home . 
What's my favorite flavour ? Blue ! 
I know it's not 2012 coming up , but I wouldn't mind a few practice zombies ... you know . Just in case . 
Thanks , Work , for my lovely GI virus . How may I repay you ? 
I am not nearly as thankful for where I am or what I have as I should be ... good changes to come . :) 
Ah , pillow gun . Where danger and comfort meet . 200 thread count ? 200 dead count .. 
** smacks ** Remember how I told you stupid was about to start getting painful ? 
Thank you to everyone who gave their birthday greetings and wishes . It was much appreciated ! <3 <3 <3 
Thank you nasty cold bug , for keeping me from working and reminding me how big of a wuss I can really be . 
Dementia , insulin , edema , catheters , cancer , Alzheimers , colostomy bags , excessive medication ... Never a dull night at my facility ! :) 
Why is EVERYBODY trying to tell me WHAT I can do and HOW I feel ? Since when did I become incapable of doing that myself ? 
I guess the humility lesson in all of this is whining gets you nothing but more aggravation . Time to suck it up , take it like a champ , and revise my Hit List .
