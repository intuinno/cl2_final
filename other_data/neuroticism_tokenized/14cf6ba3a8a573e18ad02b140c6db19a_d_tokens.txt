I really don't have to do this , but I do it for you . I could sleep ... but I choose not to . I could weep ... but I'd laugh at myself . Sometimes I can just trail tired ... that's when I know Iv'e been kept here too deep . trust me ... I think time has come soon to just leave . 
Things are people in which the places , time with cars , dampering children in streets are chaotically free-spirited and not at all dammed ; but I do know that each meaning I give to you -- would ruin your opinoun personally on ordinary nonsense . 
Loving the tucked foot on my back knee , cozy spot with a crooked smile , my curls in me eyes , the songs traveling in me mind , and most of all reading pulling my thoughts with my actions to a piece of paper . How sudden and brief but hilarious peremiter of laughter !!! 
it is past 1 am and i am still thriving off hope and faith that won't let me lay one minute in dreamland ! - i dun care wht u think , i am staying this way ^^ until the < PROPFEMALE > ! 
OF such joy and yet heart throb of the delicite souls in gathering was I ; < PROPFEMALE > , of this blessid day ; dressed in quirky pilgrim nonsense . I frockled my personality so pantronsinly ; I had no doubt what so ever that people should opionin my stout apperations and free will ! Was it me who of course ; the live light to this day to others bluring minds ? Or was I the utter enjoyment to others that thoguht I was bizzare ? 
Wantz < PROPFEMALE > see Old Dogs , culd use some laughz :D so much happened ... too lil time ... =\\ 
Can't wait to get started on my research paper ( had to pick out of heros in time thru the world , on a pc . of paper made by my literature teacher , put in a box , u had to randomly pick a paper , and get THAT person ! ) i got MOTHER TERESA .... Corless my grampa .. said its gonna be hard to get everything ! haha ... her info of life ... im motivated though 
Once upon a time ! In the dawnings and dusks of < PROPFEMALE>'s nuebla fantasy world was she , sitting on a floor , cleaning her room ; in denial if she should hear a weird broadcast from the 1930's ? SHE DID ! ... WFYI ! And guess what ?! She heard some neat and cool Jazz influences of that time ! Aye ... of such history it proly ' made of music industry today !... without that movement of song , where would rap be ! HAHA ! 
Marshmellows wait for mornings bliss to dive in cocoa and < PROPFEMALE>'s missed . She'll stretch like a tree ; so proud and founding ; out of her bed to a new beginning . Can she hear me ? She nodds . Since the one writing this knows nothing of it wrong ! ^^ 
< PROPMALE > - 5:1 ( Search for an Honest Person ) In Genesis 18:22 -23 , Abrahm tried to convince God not to destroy Sodom&Gomorrah if as many ten righteous people could be found . God agreed , but evidently the 10 didn't exsist . Here , God offers to forgive Jerusalem ifa single honest person can b found . God's ppl hav sunk Sodom's level . ( 23:14 ) 
Today , was of greatness ... learned to hold my tounge . :P Besides that- me and my blood went places to the city !... combined with ... sweat , tears , and love ... it was all a weary painting planned for my < PROPFEMALE > ... I and themselves , found process in lifes battle of seeing things thourly ( XD ) ... or say the attitude of life ... or striving ? Anyway ... today Kaite was a day to not forget !!! lol 
__| | >>(>) blank . pause . fast foward ? (Oh how I wish ! )then PLAY ! Can life alone be decoded by a smart conscious ? Or is it the faith and reality that helps us with THAT clue ?! Seeing TWO sides to every perspective ; cannot only make you farther in life ; but also lets you apply critical thinking & varations of a Lasting Debate(SO , f at any time YOU fell in the riots of a deep lure to the recession > renembadis , stayclose2famli

if miracles don't happen ( when < PROPFEMALE > open < PROPFEMALE > r eyes and grace it upon others ) life has NO meaning :D 
If Oprah goes in her time ; I know it is my role to help others ( once I have money and intrest ) , to show people in general to see voices of world ! YES ! and fun way ! and and ! ... yet be productive !... hmm It's perfect fit ! ~ if miracles don't happen ( when < PROPFEMALE > open < PROPFEMALE > r eyes and grace it upon others ) life has NO meaning :D 
Sometimes I noticed in life ; well ... your gotta be at perspective in a GOOD way each and eveRHEY day . yahhI may not get tal and for expressing myself ; it is weird ?! BUT ! I end up inventing all these abstract things ! IT is SO unexplainable :P ... I get sometimes nervous , stubborn , exagerant , fast ?! Where is understanding if you can't listen ! :( I wahz taught tht by myself ; from lips onto mind ; and 14 yrs bout later 
I was working on inventions AND SAW THE SLENDOR SHAPE OF MY LAMP !... aero dyamics ! and like everythnig WHY it evoles ! THEN I used sunlight to capture that enjoy and transport it from my conserved head ; to hands ! I felt something !... the sun CAN only go back from dark BUT dark can only thrive off sun !

To defy talent is a crucial matter one of its particular sort . Not much know how or are willing to be truthful . It is like defining gravity when we know what the sciecntist says . Or judging a picture from a face . All we know is that now ; whoever belongs to talent can boast . Whoever that doesn't say most don't boast ; but it is simplybecausea bettermanorwomenisfilledwithhatredtowardsfindingoutwhoiswhomwith talentatend .

~ Kissing all my love to all who need it ~ 
I have a novel on my mind-some quarters in dimes , at that side pocket we all never use . The clouds barely jumping with one another as the breezes keep blowing a far off grassland . Even the old myths of fairer lands stands you still in made up land . Fridgid you see- oh how this world could be ! As a child , as an adult , as the oldest ever to walk ... visions of all human matter is what we create . 
Loves writing the old fashioned way , except my fingers are always black with pure < PROPFEMALE > ink XD

~ annoyed ~ -_- 
There can't be one without two . There can't be nothing without eternity . THis parral universe of many , seems sqashed in like some coded rebellion . Like an atom that never ends of connections . Our minds kill us more then our hearts do . The God's in which we think we know are tricks we try to uncode- every answer can be questioned but never that one in which can be blamed for higher power . 
^_^ I love the name Zonta , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and some otherrrsss . =P 
< PROPFEMALE > is munching on watermelon before her piano . Now what should I play ? =) xoxo 
? Ipod = wholesome goodness in each screwed up button . Licorice = that stuff that you can double flip ppl off with , in variety . Oceans = one of the most abundent things on this < PROPFEMALE > planet of many , we could live as the dirty ground and be cold , but they help us to mold . Guess what ?! YOU'VE BEEN TOLD ! ? 
Later , at 8 am is bro running ( I hope stupid jerk Western's haul their ass off ) - meaning I gotta be ready by 7 am , not much tonight yet went at fiar I saw - Tait Sanders , < PROPMALE > , Madi Lowe , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > + < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Gaskins . o.o

Shower ... = < dun ask . 
Me feels like I love a new week and I am ready ! Yeppers ... I rlly want that < PROPFIRST > man ! If you hear me out there I ? u stiLL ... < PROPFIRST > . =P 
Consider everything that everyone does not do-fall back from those who do but crash . \ 
These mountains that hold you up , keep you alive with the air , water flow , earth , and fire in your palms . All YOU have to do is climb them , and see what the other side contains . They all tell you of mythical fantasies and dreams ... find out yourself < PROPMALE > . 
3:30 pm , and she wakes up ! 
No traveling = puking . XD 
Give me reason but don't give me choice cause I'll jsut make the ... same mistake , again . 
Dreams are left in a dead conscious that can never be read twice . 
I ? that special gatiar . 
Dancin Fishayyyy flutterz cuz ????? BA BA BA BA BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD IS DA WORD BA BA BA BA BIRD BIRD BIRD IS THE WORD HAVE YOU HEARD ?! IT'S DA WORD !!! ? I damn had that in my head for hours so I dreamed of it ... ya life can be that miserables dog . BREEDLOVE SOLO AHHH ... bro wants me to work for it . 
I cry for that sky ... as many shades as the Earth get's and yet we all seem to forget- I bleed inside for a < PROPMALE > for anything really ... as hopeless as this gets ... for some reason some God is giving me this duty . The serenity is over powering to think- so much has happened in my world and theirs . 
Somehow I love you-and I don't know how a person could not . We all think we know love- but indeed we just learn from it . You are a friend that forgivness itself makes small . Keep in spirit because I will . To love doesn't mean to please- it means to know that it is just percent in a life . Of course you can't learn from the birds if they don't fly , you can't learnfrom the sea & it'swaves but to be with canalsomeanwithout

Watching Where The Heart Is ... been very grand day =) Love you ? 
I keep getting that tear , cold internal chill , and that eerie suclusion from a dammed world . I hate all those threats , all this war , and all this news of false answers . I demand answers ; never , not liek the ones who starve and go on with their lives like they wouldn't know any different . 
I bet my lips will be alot like < PROPFEMALE > Fox , < PROPFEMALE > Winslet , < PROPFEMALE > Johansenn , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and few others . Just saying ... I was thinking that today HAHA ! ? go hotness

As we all grow and row the boat we find that sometimes the river is blank . That the road was always the river , and we tried to make it perfect , when it isn't . I try to step out of it , finding that river for everyone's sake- leave me be and let me go insane . No need for labels- all we need is Time Forgotten in our banks . 
Finally on =P ... so busay ... uhh life can rock n ' roll- but i be da one drivin ' it for yall !!! 
Ya I still kinda wonder where Rap got it's meaning from , rape ?! XD that's no < PROPMALE > . 
Your fingers don't shine no more with the reflections of your past . Maybe it is in your mind this whole glass orb , maybe it is somewhere desserted stuck in a lure . All I say is it was too late for the < PROPFEMALE > , it was too late for the night to catch . How is it that creatures go about , sad or mad , yet you seem not to care ? --> 
< PROPFEMALE > makes the night , FAMOUS !

Wearing my new clothes ... they all lavender/and light blue hues ... my fav . Hair down and all ... gotta go out ... be on later maybe . =) Happy Monday ! XD Lovetoall ! ? 
Somehow when I see myself in that mirror , out of everyone's talk and excuses- I still see you . I could get better . I could move on . But , to be the person who changed it all- isn't right after all . =( 
Never forget me ... I have too many sides to tell ... I came from a lover ... who had two tales . 
1 . Slow rock 2 . Indian/Arabic music any 3 . Blues/Jazz music 4 . Pyhscodelic/progressive 5 . country ... eh my list continues . 
< PROPMALE > is BEAST !!! ? 
Man In The Box [ likes ! ] 
Thank-you < PROPFIRST > ... XD 
Busy tonight ... lol I really wish I would stop sleeping so much ... \Whenever I fear death-the wind blows a little harder on my chest . \"" 
Knickers , guitar , scarf ... and hardly no sleep . Eh , I am fine ? no one else get's you like I do ... ya , that means it is BAD ! no joking . 
New day- etched into my skin . Like a new raw leaf broken by it's stem . Another challenge that leads me on with way . Doesn't mean I will break just for this day . 
Working on songwriting and just really liking PINK =) ? 
Bjork is simply extraordinary and one of her kind , no one could ever compare to the fantasy singing that is out of this world like her .? 
Somewhat of a fever and runny nose plus bloodshot eyes ... grh ! Nice day though . Tomorrow will be even better ? ( How will this ever work out ? Maybe I am the fool ) 
I'm actually crying because of a song . ;{ 
Lol , songwriting with 4 hours of sleep . Loosing weight cuz I barely eat [ I just not hungry . ] and listening to some chirp-chirp-peep ... me unearthly vibes of song . 
Can you guess ? ? 
No one can ever fully appriciate music or life if they keep following others . 
my hair is too adorable , weirdness is when u do ur hair to sleep in , rather then the day . 
Busy Saturday =\\ 
Here we go again =( 
Wishing I had never even said those words to you ;{ 
There is a late postman of God to my soul ... he says he wants it ... but only a glance , God wants to know why I have such a odd feeling in me . It is not my heart nor ' mind- but I am just being myself making mistakes . He may have plans ... but love can blind us all even in the image that started it all . They arn't miracles-it's just him glancing at you . 
You can love without doubt , fear , or trust and still have known them for years or a week . But , when you have loved , faought , tried so bad to explain to them things that most people would say is weird , and laughs- that is remarkably < PROPFEMALE > do able . You claim it's different , but you know me better . I am not your guardian angel or to < PROPFEMALE > on , i am yur loving friend , that made you you ... 
I laugh when people get compared to a less better version of me or I am like wait ? she is older then you ? Whoa that is wayy wrong ... but hey to everyone's belief can ' stop em ' . They just fools swimming in a fish bowl waiting to die XDDD like they would with me ! no 
Dang Spongebob marathon is tomorrow , and I have to miss it ! =( 
Slimming down helps my anger . Some of my muscles still kill right now- but man i love the burn , rlly gets things off my mind , I am jsut trying to combine the stats with a whole punchline course . Can I do it ? I know I can ... I WANNA SURF ! I WANNA DO HANDSTANDS ! and I wanna do it with the ppl that I just met on some dam beach ? 
Lip is numb haha ... Choir tonight ... Things on my mind . 
HOLLA ! Hey mr. bitch hey mrs. sir , whatcha got now on ya is a dam good slur ... stop playin round just ask eachotha out , yo uglier then hell ... why do i say this well just ask my miss ... she knws well how t oplease a mr. bitch , and kill a mrs. sir , ill help u in the way as her stardom crashes on her plane , not far off of maine ! XDHA 
Demi Lovato knows her friends ... even if no one knows I do . She is simply awesome ? 
Jaw still hurts from a total of 8 needles now and hardly any numbing stuff since I wanted to be brave , they said they never heard a patient hum while they stuck needles and drills in a mouth . XD Well that's < PROPFEMALE > for ya ! 
Singing my immortal accapella yet my throat is still croacky , I am doing fairly well !

The thunder knows how I feel XP 
Sick Puppies rox my sox !!! 
When they don't stick up for you ... and you have no where to run you are loosing your own spirit just trying to pun . I know this really , It is silly , I may write stupidly , or serious and even gay- But some people can't get it straight . < PROPFEMALE > is < PROPFEMALE > , spontanious , upside down pineapple cake < PROPFEMALE > , who sometimes can be really mad , and really funny ... IF you can't accept me , keep saying better thanmewhy even write to me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > McCurdy is pretty amazing at singing =) unlike most nowdays ... she is a < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
Caked skin ... dirty bottoms of feet ... canned beans , oh how oh how this poverty forsaken life must suck . The clothes I wear , luckily I can speak , I had one jobs-too many . I lost my wife , from having a son , now he is off somewhere drunk . I don't beg- I just pray ... and sit and hope that someday where I started is where he can take me away . 
You know what I am sick of ? All these proff . that predict crap that people has wanted to happen for thousands of years ... just because we have pollution now , just because we have so many gadgets we don't know what to do with , and jsut because msot has forgot the big aspect- we are now gonna say screw it the world's ending ? 
New American Series Breedlove ... in it's coffin tonight , my baby ... sleep tight . I love it sa much as my bed I sleep in(maybe more ) ... things can go so well if you look at them right ! 
So wish I could see Creed live !!! Dun gotz time though , I been busi at my own concerts . When I first heard his songs ... I literally cried ... and I still do because his voice and song makes so much sense to me ... 
Holding my baby =) 
Hmm Friday Night =( ... shucks this is funny ... Idk rlly ... Too say much ? of any ... heh . 
PEANUT BUTTER MY FAVORITE FOOD ! 
Hate how adults can't wake themselves up ... 
I can't believe my dream had nothing to do with my life ... yet it made so sense ... I have never heard of it , or how it came ... it's like some God threw wrath down my lane ... this dream so sudden like it came from another world ... only noises in water can save me from drown . 
I got one hour o.o damit ! 
I was a surprise to the show ... my brother thinks my family is unnormal ... and idk really I am just trying to grow up sane . XD that's my night , yurs ? 
Powerade and < PROPMALE > Payne =P 
My Generation the series coming sep . 23 looks really good ! =) 
Tonight ... is a night of simple things ... meaning XD Idk . 
We all falter we all shine ... we can see though dirt and grime ... love and hate ... and even what a country from a city is . Sometime sthough we forget who we really are , we believe that going another one's route will give us everything we need and want , but too learn a way from another and be succesful ... is to count blessing and even falter . Not to think , but to do , is the right to win . 
When life gives you assholes , tie them up and tell them who is boss ! XD 
Liu < PROPFEMALE > freekin rockz ! 
Long night for me , day tomorrow in my life , like any other ... what matters though is if I will make it special . I got like 71 more years to live anyways that's about a whle century ... =) Love to all , even the haters . 
We all want to undo time , make it our own , think and do of what we can't like others can-tears can only delay you , madness can only kill you , and happiness can only be the full choice to overpower what could have been or who was right , never . Blaming and asking are two differnt equations in the law of religion and pyhsics . Just plain being rude and not knowing , is substantchuly your fault not mine . =) 
You can be crushed inside but never lie the truth , when your not feeling right it's just a crude laugh , because it is a weakness holding you back , vulnerable to ignorant bats , falpping their wings saying I see exact , when really they are jsut a pitfall to a life full of truth and laughs . Don't say I am bigger than who I am , maybe your head needs reajustin to where it should be at ! 
STOP CRYING YOU DUMBARSE ! 
=\ \P Choco-Cherry dat is ew ... me eat cuz I wanna see me go moo ... lol jk XD 
NEW DAMN ( ssa ) < PROPFEMALE > JAM DELUXE EDITION CD OH ( kcuf ) YAAA !!! rok to those who knw how to ? 
Look to me for forgiving , I slave my words like a toxic sinner , yet I share with intoxicating threads like a winner . So , I do things wrong , doesn't mean I think wrong . So , you may say something I really am not , it is your eyes to perceive not mine . Color me dark color me not- see through these ashes and you can see through the world's eyes . 
The power of song , just correcting thee once wronged . =) 
We < PROPMALE > wish for the past in hope ... but for comparison of what it once was , could never be the way everyone wanted it to be . Somebodies elses sky , but why ! not could it be mineee !!! =( i hope someday you do have a beautiful life ... du du du du du .... 
When being speechless is not enough , maybe saying one word helps the total dread . 
Given To Fly =) 
Adventure Time !!! is da bomb ! mashed potatoes say they need applejuice ! 
/= I forgot that it's always my fault , you triple looser you . 
What healed me twas not God's blinding light or magic of any stride , nor ' the bows of any religion in my mind- but perhaps a rare accusation of the truth of thy inner spirit . Could not have been shamed of healing coincidence even false questions of miracles arriving in hearts' ? Although , to this standard lies deep sapphire vails that preach < PROPFIRST > amongst demons prowling cacoons-

Life to some is a Blurry Photograph waiting to be exposed , to others it is perfect primed up and ready for show casing ... Mine is being torn in two by the fire that brings aging history to it's brim . Don't call to me for help , running to you would make me choke . The photograph I had was in my heart all along- not needed by fancy emotions or perfect coverups ... just myself and me my whole life X )

Muted conscease , cannot live for a diverse question , even one within this crust your feet stands at . Came here within the boundries of your own making will . I look up as in spell towards your new sky you murderous villian , calling all the angels to make them hell ...

Long day and nighT . Lovin ' it though ... FAITHFUlllLLLlllLLLlllLLLlllLLLYYYyyyY !!!? 
Choices reflect the beneficial and the doubted yet they seek out new or even the original . To be open and willing or even change for someone : is not a job or task or life option ... it is a promise . If it turns into a job , task , or life option then maybe you should re-think who is doing all the work ... and changing is usless unless you keep your word . BOOYAH ! 
Should my feline be named < PROPMALE > OR < PROPFIRST > ^^ I am thinknig on Egyptian God names or Indian names ... hehe ! YAY

Ew Monday ... it shouldn't even be capitalized . 
The new photograph of me is not the best ... but it suits right now . Knowing the reality yet hiding the past ... with or without living inside is myself another human just like everyone else . To label to blame or even shadow me in the rain ... I will not take suchs shame . This scheme I have played isn't today or tomorrow ... it was yesterday . To say now ... that looking into a presence and feeling new is what we all knew . 
I scored 92 % on first try USA state map quiz ... lol I was really good in the West states ... for some reason better than East and Midwest LOL . meaning it's like a A- 
IDK about Tuesday BLEH

FIRST DAY OF SNOW FOR ME THIS YEAR !!! WHIP PEEEE ... though I wanna move ... hehe somewhere where i can tan and surf and YAH OMG .... snow peh . 
eh life is screwed up XD 
I woke up thinking it was summer already ... JUST BECAUSE of the SUN ... gosh I hate how God tricks me with his motherly mode . 
What I find funny is River Pheonix was so hot and probably very nice ... but after hidining under the public acting someone he wasn't for years ... he did powerball . A mix of Heroine and Cocaine . By the time he collapsed and was ill nothing could help him them ... his body was shutting down rapidly fast . He died on Halloween of 1993 ... donchu find that a bit scary . & that he was born on myfriendbday ? and moms year born 
Thismay sound dumb , but everyday no matter winter ... i dress inmybathing suit or skirt orshorts and tank ... and just go in front of the mirrorand act like I am surfing . LOL . I have done itforlikeever . I reallly duncare what anyone saysBUT I AMNEVER GOINGIN TANNINGBEDS ... only sun . Because as a lilgirl ' IGOTRLLY TAN . and I believe Iwant to live it up . Idc what anyone saysIwantmy life to be funnevenwith rules . wishesforbeach * 
All that fails is laughter and love to my haters . All that remains pushed aside like dust on the roof will be blown off by the West wind . All that I long for DEVOTE my-self for is rapidly changing and differnt from your choices . All that I see now is not the < PROPFEMALE > it once were . Nothing can with stand courage of admitting being you , that this space we layeth in is free .

Gosh by far my favorite of ALL woman singers , is MIlla Jovovich (; ? amazes me and captivates ? 
Circle is spinning | Mind once twisted | Right where you Stand , what makes you-YOU ? | Don't bother to tell just focus the picture on a land that falls | Along we became bewildered with our regrets of love | When I found that words meant nothing to you as much for you towards the actions I chose- we were through | You and I both stopped the circle wheel of love just for one everlasting lie

To be without , convinving yourself you live for today . Thinking of only the past you put in shame . Leaving a legacy forgotten , I blow away the dust for your legend . Loved and full of faith Iwas , until I found out it was never real ... in the first place I had begun with you . SO I continue all alone , and someday re-unite with you in different worlds ' that we assume .

Attachment of time is lured in by forgetting a single memoir . Knocking towards me for apprication the clock stares at me for years beyond millenium sought . If time tracks devices , are we all euology for one light and a focused darkness that kills us raw ? looks down --> 
What's a Friday gotta do to get some free fun =) ?! 
Btw , anyone who was wondering my new name is a name I made up a LONGGG time ago when I was little XD 
All these cuts on my hands XDD painful 
I knew something beyond human grasp when I layed eyes on the Sun . Such small twas but never appeards bigger or smaller even how much I spent running away from it as a child . The sky big and same always grey or bright blue on a good day . That how much energy it contained to manifest us all , why not yet ?! wht not now ... then ?! 
OJ does not help ! OWWW XD 
Nobody knows who you are , unless you show them the ways . They do not know who you'll be by the last century you are in . But , they can give you a stare and you a laugh someday in a train . Living but barely breathing hooves astruken by lost faith . Could a coward really choose their fate ? Once they have fallen in a leader of hate , put away and don't return ... or you won't be a mystery to me today . 
Sorry to consume you , my actions were at struggles stupidty crying out , telling myself what is more important ?! But no it never could possibly be me =D 
anyone < PROPFEMALE > put a clip on their lips and popped it ova and ova again ?! haha hurts so good XD 
Says to friend Evie : What do you think of anime ?! She responds : it's shit .. i'd rather have aids than watch it . | 
Sepultra my new FAVO 
Uhhh ! I have been writing some of my story ... ;) i started at less than a < PROPFEMALE > now I am almost at 5 < PROPFEMALE > s . 
I just relised , all my epic poetic and heroic status ' of the past I can never get them back ya'll!!! =( 
I did not expect my long curly hair to only take 45 mintues under a flat iron , HAIR STYLER WAS RIGHT ; that baby can work good and fast =) it usually takes 2 hours XP 
Oatmeal-running to get readiii-jeep ride to city-piano lessons-talk about my hair XD i straightneed-emmmpress of being a soon metal GODDESS ! - and trying to not be a gike . 
When I have everything , I do not know what nothing is . All is good and the descion to make bad is incapable of that pushed threads . If love is a like , then why lie and be stupid for once wanting to know emotions . Give it allawway , but be filled with regret in the ladder of days . I do it becauseliving must be the choice I only have to give foryou faked .. to replace .. and replicate . Die forme , andwait- I need none of you . 
To play a role and forget the lines ; how much lies really show through your achey spine . You convince me that you're free , when let alone three others ' follow your lead . I want so bad to see you as my mind feels , but I would be living out nods and lies your crushes hurl up hindered from lost question you think I am . 
UH ! where to start =/ if I could stop ... 
orange orange orange orange ... oh how blue stands out more than you XD haha 
I screw everything up , then pick it up piece by piece laughing while they think I insane =) 
One < PROPMALE > in life , I pleaded for two when the first got shot down with my mind . The secondnever came , but I knew my heartwould decide then . As if time was real I opened up to streal the remaining cash . Nobody knows until theylook into the eyes of a dawning angel , whos wept halfher lifeeternal away.to just get one breakof this worldshe stays alone . Building character was another regret for atrosion to bomb it outagain . 
I LIKE CHOCOOOLATEE MILKKKK ! what ? I LIKKEEEE CHOCOLATE MILKKK !! whattt huh ? I FREEKIN LOVE THIS CHOCOLATE MILK GOSH YOU MAKING ME BREAK CHARCTER weasal ! haha , ik squrrial X ) ik ... what's goinn on ya'll says hen ?!! XD

Thinking is what living is not . If breathing is apart of living , than not thinking is what in living that makes you actually live ?! 
How could luck be given away , when it was trying your hardest in every way ?! When did you loose your head after you won the award for best genuis ?! Why do we even live when dying is what God looks for ?! Will you tell me the illusion that I missed while living here in the dwelling curse that is hard to break upon ?! Everyone wants to know the casting who did this spell , for it was US all along fate .

Do you despise words ? Or just play a role in talking gab to a society that controls you ?! I bet so , remind me later when life will be for me alone : v.v ya 
Lyrics : Yellow memories enough to < PROPMALE > me . Black dawning the right amount of tradgedy . What you take from me , the Gods ' cannot replace ... all these years I ahve destined for fates waste . Yurning from ions away is a cluster that calls out to us , but we left questioning the Gods ' long too soon to respond . ( more later LOL )

When life lives without you- don't < PROPMALE > it , it is just going to make you die sooner . 
Nothing to say is always a thought before an action done twice in the future . 
You arn't what you think you are when you've let yourself go to the sixth dimension of thought and memoir in life .

The Great Gig in The Sky is like being born through fire and water , watching the dirt make me who I am and the air filterating my lungs ... preparing for this show once more . Never hold me back fear and hate , just causing me to forget who I am each day . Love toes can't help loving your faces either , peace baby <

Anybody watch the sunrise like 10 minutes ago ?! The Sun is like more to the North rising in the Summer and more to the South rising in the Winter . Can't tell you about sunset or < PROPFEMALE > though just yet LOL ! 
What we don't see , is the gates un-opened . When we try to listen , all this commotion gets louder and stronger . But , when we look or listen for miracles- do we really at all feel them in our presence of which we already seclusivly have ?! Miracles ' are not contradictions/perdictaments ; they are the unexplained soul that never needs examination . 
Between our world and the next , is where we loose regrets of knowing and knowledge- the place of ignorance and faith and infinite beyond ... love train YO ! 
Anybody EVEN know the reason WHY I am getting fit ?! ( for surfing duh )
