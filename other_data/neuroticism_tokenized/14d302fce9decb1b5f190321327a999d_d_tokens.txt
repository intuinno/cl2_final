South park is by far the greatest show ever . 
movies in the park wasn't too bad . 
Writing a song 
Gotta love South Park 
I was on a boat . It was awesome . I hurt my elbow/knees though . 
Possible band practice tomorrow ? :O 
Today was so productive ! Hooray ! Tomorrow/Saturday should be too if all goes according to plan . 
< PROPFIRST > has mayonnaise ..... 
Why does Beyond the Dark Sun have to be so difficult ? :S 
I need to stop staying up this late ... 
Anyone going to the Def Leppard/Poison/Cheap Trick concert on monday ? 
The concert got postponed :/ 
Death to goldfish . 
My mail needs to hurry the hell up and get here :/ 
So the mail came and I didn't get my schedule . Excellent . 
is listening to pretty acoustic music . That's a switch , huh ? 
Well , it took all day , but I finished my notecards . Go me ? Gots to do the cube tomorrow , hopefully that goes somewhat smoothly . 
I read Devil's Arithmetic in like 2 hours . Now someone help me do the cube on it >.< 
Paganini's 5th < PROPFEMALE > is quite difficult , to say the least ... 
Go still being awake at 1:30 ? 
Children of Bodom needs to stop being so damn good so I can play more of their songs . >.> 
Friday . Yes . 
Saw a bunch of people he knew at the fair yesterday 
Set my Pandora channel to In Flames and I'm good to go . 
So who all's planning on going to buzzfest ? 
Steel Panther ? I think yes .

Boondocks might be the absolute greatest show ever . 
I broke a string :( 
Oh joy , my chat stopped working . 
Wipeout is absolutely hilarious . 
I love when white people try to act like hard asses from the ghetto ! xD 
-Insert controversial comment here- 
Buzzfest is a bunch of saucy faggots that won't let people play under a tarp while it's raining . Thanks to them , we didn't get to see Mudvayne or < PROPFEMALE > in Chains . Great . 
Writing a song . Not getting stuck this time either . Joey/Simon need to hear this like right now . 
Why does my chat keep breaking ? 
Who wants to < PROPFEMALE > in the near future ? 
MY CHAT KEEPS NOT WORKING ! D: 
It's raining ! :D 
This paper is tedious ... :/ 
I actually like a rap band ... 
She's only Seventeen ! ( Seventeen ) 
What the hell ! This Gibson pick was uncomfortable a week ago and now I can play faster with it ?! 
And just when I thought she was comin ' to my door ! She whispered sweet , and brought me to the floor ! She said ... 
Guitar Hero World Tour . My vocals are amazing . < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > know .... 
Surreality . 
Surround sound + In Flames = contentment 
UGH . My < PROPFEMALE > wrecked . 
Might have the flu ... 
Scarred for life . Ole knows >.> 
This project is taking forever ! But I shall be done soon enough hopefully . 
Almost ..... Done ... With ... Math ...... 
wonders why everyone is posting MLIA posts as their statuses every 15 seconds . It's somewhat bothersome . 
Needs something to do next weekend . 
I love my incredibly uncoordinated dog . 
Looks like it's going to be another sleepless night . Alright ! :/ 
Thoroughly shocked . :O 
Tomato . ( < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > should definitely know\ " , 2009-1 0-0 3 04:40:44 " 
pretty damn good day . 
Leaf Notebook . :/ 
I'm either losing my mind or going crazy . 
Will not be sleeping for a while . Feel free to text me 
Something shitty always seems to fall on my birthday . Braces last year , SAT this year , I wonder how next year will top those . 
Plugged my computer into my amp , and now I'm listening to CoB with the volume on like 8 . My house is rumbling a bit . 
Oh boy , possible surgery during fall break . That's not going to suck at all . 
Hope is dead , revelation begins . We're not strangers but we'll never be friends . 
Im not the only soul whos accused of hit and run . Tire tracks all across your back . I can see you had your fun . 
Today was basically kickass . Thanks for all the happy birthdays . 
Definitely just got Falcon Punched by < PROPMALE > . 
Listening to some < PROPMALE > Dufour trying to clear my head . On the bright side , surgery tomorrow ! >.> 
Oww my face . 
Only one more day of fall break . :/ 
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missin ' , many many men can't see the open road . 
Just got back from the Kiss concert . They put on a hell of a show ! 
just got around to listening to Mastodon's new album , and I absolutely love it . 
Just listened to a 37 minute Yngwie Malmsteen solo on Pandora . 
Super pissed that my parents are unreasonable and overreact to EVERYTHING . 
My phone no longer works . Hooray . 
New phone ; I need < PROPFIRST > . 
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world . 
In the process of writing a masterpiece . < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > need to hear this ASAP . 
needs more Dream Theater on his iPod . 
So who wants to buy me a $ 3,000 < PROPFIRST > Petrucci signature Seven String ( Mystic Glow Finish ) guitar ? 
Needs a distraction from 3 more hours of mindless guitar exercises ! 
is going to learn Damage Control no matter how ridiculously difficult it may be . 
Killswitch Engage and Dark Tranquility at Rocketown March 16 ? I think yes . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Stabbed mah thumb with a guitar string :( 
Things are looking up for you , < PROPFIRST > Hajjafar . I'm actually crying right now lmfao . 
Ahahaha , Saints just got shit on by a 2-12 team . 
How can one be so tired and not be able to sleep ? 
Death to Papa Roach , Blink 182 . All those fuckin ' pussies sound like doggie doo ! Steel Panther never gets old . 
Avatar was pretty kickass . 
I need plans for the rest of the break . 
I really when that when I told my iPod to play an album it would play the god damn album straight through and not put itself on shuffle -.- 
Surround sound in my room ^_^ 
Is in the mood to download massive amounts of music . Any suggestions ? 
I love music . 
Stop using the snow word people . Come on . Wait ... 
\These goobers keep distracting me ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Cox " 
With you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead . You're just like crosstown traffic . So hard to get through to you . 
< PROPFIRST > Santoro's story at lunch today was probably one of the funniest things I have ever heard .

Foamy the Squirrel . :D 
I sense a cat in my house .. 
Metro's getting a little overzealous with these cancellations . 
We the People paper . :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > in Chains was absolutely incredible . All my expectations were completely blown away . 
Nothing about today was bad . Especially sushi . < PROPFIRST > Brannon , < PROPFIRST > Santoro , < PROPMALE > Skipp Sweetman , and < PROPFIRST > Lyles know exactly what I'm talking about . 
Dream Theater and Iron Maiden in the same concert ? Absolutely . I nearly cried when I heard . 
So thanks to < PROPMALE > Araya having back surgery , Megadeth/Slayer/Testament aren't playing in Nashville . That's awesome . 
Straight ones ! Not a bad start to Spring Break . 
I'm pretty sure I win the best dressed award today . 
Butterflies & Hurricanes 
Very good night . 
This week was eventful , to say the least ... Particularly Thursday through Saturday .

Congrats to all those who made SJB and Wind Ensemble ! 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > Santoro for showing me Opeth .

\It's hotter than three fat girls ridin ' in a put put in the middle of the desert with no air conditionin ' . \ " You crazy buttah ! " 
Give me ideas for a song .

Hey < PROPFEMALE > Flowers ! 
< PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > Flowers 
Bandwagon time ! Like this status and I'll tell you something I like and dislike about you , my first impression of you , and a confession . 
Which to read first : Kaffir Boy or The Alchemist ? 
It's not real . It's just a dream . This is all bullshit ! 
Time to do all of my summer work in a day . 
Uhgn .. 
A group of cats can be referred to as a nuisance , a clutter , or a destruction . 
I'm a shooting < PROPFEMALE > leaping through the sky , like a tiger defying the laws of gravity . 
Movie tomorrow with < PROPFEMALE > Flowers . 
Donkey Kong 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Flowers , \ 
I can't think of anything to sufficiently express your awesomeness , but you're awesome . \ 
Love , < PROPMALE > . 
Has the hottest date to homecoming ever . Chyeah ! 
When it rains , it pours . 
People should smile more . 
Today's certainly been pretty awesome . Thanks to everyone who made this birthday one to remember , and thanks for all the birthday wishes too ! 
What a start to fall break ... 
Let's be honest here . Would you rather take your exams tomorrow , or do them in January when you've forgotten nearly all the material you've covered this semester ? I mean it's not like you're actually going to study between now and then , so why long for your grade to be worse that it's already going to be ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Kids episode of South Park on Comedy Central . 
< PROPMALE > Mintzer .. Pretty out there , but pretty awesome . 
I sure wish AP Slacking was a class option .
