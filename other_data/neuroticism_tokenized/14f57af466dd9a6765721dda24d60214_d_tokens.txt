Sorry everyone , I am not going to be online much for a while . I was admitted to the hospital on Sunday evening for acute appendicitis . Yesterday , I had an emergency appendectomy , so I am in a lot of pain and siting at the computer is not something that feels too good at the moment . 
Tired of not feeling well and hurting every time I move . Still am not allowed to drive . Doc said 2 weeks after surgery if I feel at 100% . So what did I go and do ? I ate popcorn and started coughing , strained a muscle . So much for life being back to norm this week . Still cant lift anything for another 2.5 weeks too . And to think , I might be facing 2 more surgeries in the near future .... gah ! 
Grrr ... I am really irritated . My son's school is telling me they are going to suspend him because he had physical contact with another student ( that resulted in my son getting hurt ) during a basketball game ... last Friday ( suspension is tomorrow ) . 
Paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a smack upside the head . People who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head , except a smack upside the head , but we can raise awareness !!
