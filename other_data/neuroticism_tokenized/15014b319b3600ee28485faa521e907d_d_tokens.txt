Being a Christian is like being a pumpkin . God picks you from the patch and washes all the dirt off of you . He cuts off the top and scoops out all the yucky stuff . He removes the seeds of doubt , hate and greed . He carves you a new smiling face and puts His light inside of you to shine , for all the world to see . This was passed to me by another pumpkin . Now it's your turn to pass on to the pumpkins in your patch . :) 
so I get home from the freshman game , I go to my room & what do I find ? < PROPFEMALE > sprawled out in MY bed , sleeping in MY pajama pants , & her stuff all around MY room . yep , that's MY bestfriend (:

I gotta couple dents in my fender , got a couple rips in my jeans . Tryna to the pieces together , but perfection is my enemy . & on my own I'm so clumsy , but on your shoulders I can see I'm free to be me . (: 
OMG I JUST SAW A DISLIKE BUTTON ! YESSSS !!! :) 
you're thinking about life , but you're thinking about more than that

I just want you to see , what you have right in front of you . 
Are you gonna be my only exception ? :) 
I hate when I wanna put something on this , but I don't know what to put ! 
Hm .. why ? Why did you have to come into my life ? I am not a hateful person . But right now , I hate you . & her , I think her more . but whatever , maybe you'll see what your doing , your mistake . but then again , you were stupid enough to fall for her the first time so maybe not . ha

Often we let our morals reflect who we are dating & that isn't how it should be . Our morals should be reflecting who WE are . Not who our temporary partners are . 
They're just children , from the outside <3

Sometimes you have to hurt others , as much as you don't want to , in order to make yourself happy . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > <3 
I love my < PROPFEMALE > Bear :) 
It happens :) 
If you really wanted to cheer her up , you should have bought her a banjo . 
It's like a combination of recieving a foot massage , jumping on a trampoline , getting tickled , rolling downhill , and peeing after holding it in for three hours .
