This sounds fun . Send me a number in my inbox , and I will write on my status what I really think about you , without anyone knowing who I'm talking about . 
50 : So I've known who you were since freshman year but never really talked to you until senior year . You sat right across from me and I basically made it my goal to put you in a good mood every day . Remember when I made you a list of all the things I liked about you ? I meant them all . You're a super chill guy and I love it when you're happy . I'm glad we got to know each other last year and < PROPFEMALE > out over the summer :) 
34 : Oh my goodness . You make me smile SO much . I love texting you every day . I love it when you suggest music for me to listen to . I love how you can give me reality checks ;) Your hugs are awesome . You're so freaking adorable . You make me really nervous . I appreciate you so much and I want you to be truly happy , no matter what it takes . I'm so glad we've gotten to know each other :) 
767676 : You make me giggle pretty often . You're extremely intelligent and that's refreshing . I love that you make someone who's extremely important to me very happy ! You're such a unique person and I think you are rather cool . Heh . 
657545367 : What to say ? You're HILARIOUS . Your sense of humor is so unique and kind of awfully hysterical . Hahah . To be honest , I really could not stand you when you were a freshman . You made me so angry hahah . Also , your late night ( possibly drunken ? ) texts this summer always made me laugh ( except for when you seemed kinda sad ) . I hope I get to see you sometime this summer ! :) 
9001 : I'm so happy I got to know you last year ! Your stance on geeks vs nerds vs dorks was pretty great . I really like talking to you because I find you extremely interesting . The few times we saw each other outside of school were special to me , especially the last group hangout before college started ! I hope you liked the letter I wrote you a few weeks ago and I hope you're doing well . 
007 : I could write an essay on what I think about you ! I love how close we got last year . You're the only person I know who would drop what you're doing in the middle of the night to come lay with me til I was ready to sleep just because I was sad . I care about you so much . Your caring , funny , unique personality is just part of the reason you're one of my best friends . You're truly a fantastic person . Love you . 
2 : You are honestly one of the most caring people I've ever met . When you are happy , I'm happy . I wish you would realize what a great person you are . You always cheered me up last year and being around you always lifts my spirits . Gahhh you're so great and I feel blessed to have met you . 
1 : I luff yew . You were constantly making me laugh whenever I was around you . I miss you so much ! You're so awesome and funny and fantastic . Our plans for living together were ( though slightly inappropriate ) something I would actually love . You're going to do great things with your life ; I know it . You're one of a kind , and that's definitely a good thing ;) 
1964 : We haven't really talked in a long time , but we have a lot of memories from when we were younger . Girl scouts ? Heck yes . I miss that sometimes . You're really pretty and quiet ( but not too quiet ! ) and I appreciate that you're a fellow bookworm . 
17 : You mean the world to me . I can talk to you about everything . You understand me better than anyone & sometimes I hate ( but usually love ) it . I'll never be able to thank you enough for all you've done for me . I'll always be here for you . I feel bad for all the times I yelled & pushed you away . You're smart , fun , and ... there are no words to explain it all . You're a permanent part of my life , I hope you know that :P 
719 : Hahh you are extremely attractive :P Since the beginning of < PROPMALE > year , I've always wanted to get to know you because you seemed like such an awesome guy ( and you ARE ! ) I wish we had gotten the < PROPMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > out because I think you're really fun to be around . You're pretty darrrrrnn cool ;) 
17043 : I miss youuuuu !!! Oh my goodness , we got so close so fast . I really really love you like a sister ( because we totally are sisters now ! ) and I loved how you would always analyze my boy frustration last year :P You're so amazing and silly and ... GOATSSSS <3 hahaha baby come back ! 
21 : Your laughter is contagious :) I enjoyed the years of soccer with you and I'm happy that it seems you're doing great with school and helping at the school and such . 
1985 : You're extremely beautiful , talented , intelligent , and more . I've always been jealous of you :P but not in a creepy way . You've been such a good friend to me and I've never been afraid of being myself around you . I have so , so much fun every time we < PROPFEMALE > out . You're an amazing young woman and I appreciate everything about you . I miss and love you so much <3 
666 : Oh , you would . My number one , I miss you so so so so much . I miss talking ALL the time . We're basically twins . I miss discussing < PROPMALE > Potter , Gilmore Girls , and gamma < PROPFIRST > bursts with you . You're so freaking cute and witty and gahhh I love you . Please come to college with me next year ? 
118 : I think you know how much you mean to me . At least I hope so . We've been to Hell and back with each other and have seen each other grow into the strong people we are now . You're beautiful , driven , thoughtful , silly , intelligent , and an amazing friend . I LOVE seeing you happy . I can't think of a more deserving person than you , honestly . Your friendship is SO important to me . Hope to see you soon <3
