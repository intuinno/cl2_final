News update on the escaped cat ... he has been sighted twice now . last night food in garage was eaten , so we rented humane animals traps and set them out in our garage and in a neighbor's yard where he was sighted . His feral slut puppy running vacation is over now that i am not freaked out he is hurt and in a ditch some where . 
Day 4 ... still no < PROPMALE > . We trapped a small brown and grey feral female last night . It was heart rending . She was so hungry she ate the styrofoam bowl that we had put the bait food in . We promised the resort we would only trap and release . I wish we could have brought her to the shelter . 
We searched the grounds again from 3am to 4:30 , a cat's active time , but nothing . I am not sure those people really saw < PROPMALE > . I am heading to the local shelter to search for him this afternoon . < PROPFIRST > said while I was there if I found an orange kitten to bring him home . I am not ready to give up on < PROPMALE > yet . 
(¯`* • . ¸IT'S\ 
DAUGHTER WEEK ! ¸ . • *´¯) If you have a daughter who makes your life \

another unsuccessful trip to animal control ... but there was a family there adopting a kitten , so on a positive note ... one less kitten was put down today in pasco county . 
Still no < PROPMALE > ... there's just no sunshine in my life :( 
OK ONE OF THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF A LIFE ... < PROPMALE > WAS FOUND LAST NIGHT ( AND YES I KNOW I AM IN CAPS ) AND SON IS EMPLOYED ! 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > for returning < PROPMALE > the cat at 1:45 this am . Thank you to everyone who helped search , post flyers , send emails and newsletters , open your garages for me , and keeping your eyes open . Thank you to everyone at Caliente , as a community it was touching how everyone was so kind . 
< PROPMALE > is no longer a 17lb soccer ball which the vet will be thrilled with ... he's a fighting weight of 14.25 lbs now lol . He's fine with a few scratches ( most nearly healed ) and a missing toenail . He's happy to be home , but his sister is not so thrilled . i think she got used to being the center of attention and even after his bath he must smell a little too much like freedom ! 
now if good things come in threes ... my ventrilo will work for tonight's raid !!!! 
Finally a gorgeous < PROPFEMALE > day here in Tampa . Great day for the pool . Band was nice , weather was nice , mango daiquari was nice ... 
It is wonderful to have < PROPMALE > cat back home . But he has reverted to the ways of the wild cat , party all night - sleep all day . The only problem is he wants company , and neither myself or Cordele want to play at 4am . It is impossible to sleep with < PROPMALE > wanting to party and Cordele hissing at him . < PROPFIRST > seems to have no problem ! Maybe I need to ship cat to Annelise ... the they seem to have the same schedule ! 
RIP Mr. Steinbrenner . Thanks for all the years of great baseball ! 
You know you are cool when your phone is technologically advanced you can't figure out how to answer it and you take a picture of your foot trying to text your husband ! 
Got the fb mobile going . 
< PROPFIRST > picked some peaches from her trees ( i helped very little lol ) . It was their second year , so it's her first real crop ! Then her wonderful husband made us < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s and we floated in the pool . It was a lovely day 8 < PROPMALE > south of Ducktown , < PROPFEMALE > ( and yes there is really a Ducktown Ga ! ) . Fresh peach cobbler for dessert tomorrow night ! 
So < PROPFIRST > Hutto is in charge of finding a dance club in cumming ga ... we have dinner , drive 10 miutes north to the club , and it's a church ! < PROPFIRST > loads it in the gps on her phone , sure enough the address from google is now a hispanic church ! somehow i don't think they were ready for us 2 < PROPMALE > east of ducktown lol ! fortunately < PROPFIRST > knew the ridge club had dancing and hutto was saved ! 
Anniversary Week ... any ideas of what to give Hutto ? 
<---- Hoping < PROPFEMALE > will see that WoW is promising 2010 release of Cataclysm collector's edition with the in game collecor's pet ... hint hint < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Dalai Lama Despair is never a solution , it is the ultimate failure . In Tibetan we say , “if the rope breaks nine times , we must splice it together a tenth time” . Even if ultimately we do fail , at least we will have no feelings of regret . And when we combine this insight with a clear appreciation of our potential to benefit others , we can begin to restore our hope and confidence . 
If anyone is interested or knows someone who might be interested in renting a villa in Caliente ( furnished or unfurnished ) give me a call . Hutto and I are thinking about renting out the villa . 
tired tired and only half way through wedding week ... i'm ready to go home ! i need a nap and it's only 9 am in california ! hurry up monday ! 
Finally landed back in Fla . Looking forward to seeing my kitties then bitsy ! 
why is it 30 seconds after you call the ac repair company it starts working again ? 
had to get new phone ... who knew putting your phone through the clothes washer killed it ! i lost all my contact info ! so if u r not in the phone book or have ur number on ur fb info , can u message it ? 
update on the cell phone through the washer ... this is amazing , my carrier suggested this . for drown cell phones ... put in a bowl of rice , then charge it after a few days . i left mine in it a week ... my hero phone now works perfectly after going through the entire laundry cycle ! 
up today at 6:30 ... am ! and i think hxll froze over . it was 24 degrees here . but it was world of warcraft expansion day , so it was xmas early at my house ! azeroth was warm and toasty despite < PROPFEMALE>'s freezing weather . 
Went to see the Nutcracker at the Fox last night . The new costumes sets were stunning . The live orchestra made it extra special ... and of course the champagne helped :) 
Thank you everyone for the birthday greetings ... I had a wonderful time in Florida ... and a slow day recovering yesterday . 
If you have a gorgeous daughter , put this as your status ? ? \
