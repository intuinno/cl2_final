well just got back from the hospital ... fell through my garage ceiling but caught one of the joist on the way down with one hand , but tore my bicep tendon . have go see a DR . about reattaching it to the bone . My upper arm looks deformed now ... still works though ! Also have a big hole in my garage ceiling to fix 
Went to see a surgeon about my arm today . He told me the Distal Bicep Tendon is completely torn from the bone in my forearm . Surgury would have me in a arm brace 4-6 weeks , 3 months of rehab afterwards and a full year until normal function . Without surgury my bicep will not function , and I would lose 30-60% strength in flexing my arm and supination of my hand . Also risk of nerve and blood vessel damage with surgury .
