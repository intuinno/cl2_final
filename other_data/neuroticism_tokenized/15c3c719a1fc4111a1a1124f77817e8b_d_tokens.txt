One Day Closer to Spring ! 
I'm not super superstitious , but this year JULY has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So Copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy ,... will be without money . \ 
Wat could it hurt ? 
Today marks the one year anniversary to two journeys : one ending and one beginning . Remembering my Uncle < PROPFIRST > E . Ball who passed . Think of you often . See you in the funny papers . \ 
Also , celebrating that we were in Cancun and we actually jumped the broom , got hitched , whatever you want to call it ... for us our hearts were already beating together as one , so < PROPMALE > gave me his name . :)
