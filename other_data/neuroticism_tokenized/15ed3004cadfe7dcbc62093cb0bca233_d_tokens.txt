WHY DOES EVERYONE FEEL BAD FOR ME THAT I'VE NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND ?! Dx It's not like I'm cryin over it -- I don't care . I would consider < PROPFIRST > one , but that would only for making fun of him because he doesn't like girls . ( AND NO . HE'S NOT A HOMOSEXUAL D:< ) Oh . wait . HE DOES LIKE SOMEONE |D * evil super laugh * AND I KNOW WHO . MUAHUAHUAHUAHUAHUAHUA * runs away *

Gooooin to < PROPFIRST>'s party tomorrow . woot ! Albeit , I'm scared of seeing < PROPFEMALE > ... shes pretty crazy . ( jk ) 
Just because I know he doesn't want anyone to know , I'm going to say it :\ 
My daddy is sentimental :D He cried a bit while watching Up . 
Schools out ! ? 
I'm upset that Mr. Dabback never brought in his unicycle . 
Go figure that just as summer starts , I begin to regularly wake up from either 6-9 in the morning . Anyway , if anyone wants to < PROPFEMALE > out sometime soon , message or something 
Pretty fly for a white guy . 
Omg\ 
\ 
???????????????????????? \ 
??????????????????????? \ 
????????????????????? \ 
???????????????????? 
Probably gonna go to < PROPFEMALE>'s house sometime soon . But that would mean I have to call her . Which means I'd have to charge my phone and get the number . 
Can you believe my step-dad managed to tell mom and I that he's never seen the first two Toy Storys- right after we saw the third one ? He didn't even have a clue what was going on throughout the whole movie ! >:| 
Going to see Despicable Me tomorrow . 
I hope I don't have to walk alone to school . : x 
Mr. Dabback rides down my street every morning on his way to work . \ 
I would say hi every time , but I don't want him to hit a car or something . Oh well . D: 
Goin ' to the freshman game ..? 
Suddenly wondering what would've happened if I stayed in Illinois ? Better yet , I wonder about the future , and the next time we're moving . Hmm ... 
Yay for winning . And hanging with friends . And eating < PROPFEMALE > . And , well , I don't know . Hooray for the weekend !? 
Hope everyone had a good day . \ 
Don't know why I'm saying this , but it's a status update and I'm going to bed so thats considered an update , right ? 
' Cause if you jump , I will jump too . We will fall together from the building's ledge never looking back on what we've done . We'll say , \It was love . \ " ' Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue . " 
I'm just going to say that Mrs. Stackhouse kinda freaks me out for some reason . And I can't help but just laugh whenever she speaks . :D There's also the fact that \Charles\ " and < PROPFIRST > sit next to me . " 
Stupid 101 fever . So much for perfect attendance . Oh well ... Infecting my brother by wearing his big black sweater allll day . :) 
Yay for spirit week starting tomorrow ! 
I'm twinless so far . 
Like a G6 
I can't wait for it to be Saturday . 
I always bring my camera to the dances , but I never remember to take pictures . Anyway , Homecoming was fun . I hugged lots of people and chilled with my bestest buddies . :) Overall , it was fun 
Shots ? \ 
One of my all time fav songs ever . :) 
So apparently those Fisher-Price trike thingies were causing genital bleeding to little kids ? Ouch . Just ... ouch . 
And , love , such a silly game we play ...? 
Don't forget to tell someone you love them tomorrow . 
Today I'm going to hug every single choir kid I know . 
Today must be abuse < PROPFIRST > A . Price Day . I've been tripped twice , hit in any form about 7 times , nearly fell off my chair in ceramics , and I accidentally was punched in the mouth . ( My lip is STILL bleeding somehow . )\ 
So if you haven't already contributed to today , I'll be at the football game tonight . 
Goin ' to the game 
Had a fun night with < PROPFIRST > Knight , < PROPFIRST > Freese , < PROPFEMALE > Shalter , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Quigg , < PROPFIRST > DiPietro , Brandes Yenchick , and < PROPFIRST > .? 
Good morning , starshine ! The earth says \Hello ! \"" 
My toes are cold from sitting outside . And almost all of the < PROPFEMALE > is gone . Like , really ? I was gonna eat that ! 
I have the feeling tomorrow is going to be as bad as today was . * sigh * 
Scooby-Dooby-Doo , where are you ? We got some work to do now . Scooby-Dooby-Doo , where are you ? We need some help from you now ... 
So < PROPMALE > Nye passed out at a presentation in USC , and nobody helps him ... instead , they choose to update their statuses . How insane is that ? 
I'm semi-busy < PROPFEMALE > ing out with my mom ... and I'm not embarrassed to say it . :) Although I hope I can < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > soon . 
Um if anybody has a lost little fluffy gray kitten , it's like hanging out on my porch ...? 
Going to the game and hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow ! :) 
Happy Thanksgiving 
Had the snack , which had enough food for a meal . Now it's time for dinner , and THEN dessert ... Dessert has like 5 pies ... ice cream , ect . I'm going to die by the end of today . 
I'm dumb . My parents never saw < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > , so I suggested we rent it . little did I know that someone already bought me the DVD . 
Summer needs to come sooner ... only so I can go back to Illinois ? 
I just remembered that spanish ' Adjectivos ' video or whatever ... with the duck and those really weird guys . One of them was named < PROPMALE > Stone or whatever . Man that thing was hilarious , but very strange . 
I wonder if < PROPFEMALE>'s elves ever use the Scotch™ Gift Wrap Cutter ... 
I would just like to say that MY Friday night consisted of making little Christmas bags and whipping my hair back and forth and jammin ' out to super awesome , old Holiday music . Crazy stuff , huh ? Beat THAT < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . :) 
Ho-Ho-Ho ! * whips my hat back and forth * 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !? 
I think the most surprising thing that could ever happen in my life is if everyone in the world actually acted like themselves for a day , instead of pretending to be someone they aren't . Too bad it'll never happen . 
Not to be mean , but I don't care what any scientist or anyone says- I was born an Aquarius and that's what I'll always be 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ! ? Today was great . :) 
Get up . Get showered . Get ready , ect . Walk downstairs and watch TV and find out we're closed today . 
Fun day with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . :D And my socks are now officially soaked . 
Haha Chick-Fil-A Daddy-Daughter Date Night . Awesomeee !? I jacked everything off that table , though ... 
I feel like I've got a fever :/ 
Speaking of having a fever , I WOULD be sick on < PROPFIRST>'s Day .
