feels awful that her mom broke her wrist after she fell on a wet floor in my house !!! 

has a horrible sore throat . Ok -- who got me sick ??! 
wonders why she is physically unable to go to bed any earlier than midnight when she knows Zoey will be up early and mommy will be dead tired and crabby 
Relaxing after a long HOT day wandering around < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > . Heat index was like 115 degrees ! 
had a good day here in Atlanta , GA . Started by hanging with my new BFF < PROPMALE > Corwin and a Burmese Python , and ended with a Train concert . 
is not looking forward to driving for hours and hours to get back home :(
