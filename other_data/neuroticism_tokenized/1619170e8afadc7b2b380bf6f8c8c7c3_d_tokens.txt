Im wondering about this bad economy thing . Because I am selling a stupid amount of cars . 

Alright ! Have internet set up again finally . But I need help . If you have A Playstation Network ID or a Xbox Live Gamertag , Please message me with it and I will give you mine . I need people to game with . 
Great , now I have to go into work and clean off all of the cars on the lot . Thankfully Saturn is now defunct and I only have to clean off 6 cars . This is the only time i will be grateful for not having inventory . 
My wife has a facebook now . Now I have to watch what I say ... 
Its 2 in the morning and im wide awake ... I have to be at work at 0830 ... This is going to be a long day . 
Got my sales sheet today . Just barely made quota last month . Still does not make me any money though :( You people need to come buy a car from me . 
Finally saw The Big Lebowski last night . Why the hell did it take me so long to watch that movie . What a horrible waste . 
My sister gave birth today . Addison < PROPFEMALE > Waddick was born at 10:23 am and weighed 7lbs 14oz . I am now an Uncle . How surreal . 
I wish I had some cookies right now . 
How is it that I can have such a good , productive day and still feel down at the end of said day ? 
I now have windows Phone . The Samsung . It is beautiful . In fact I am posting this from said phone . 
There is something about Oreo cookies that makea it so I can't eat just one . Damn them . I'm fat enough . 
Banana dog fig face ! Banana dog fig face ! Banana dog fig face ! Hosana ! 
I love my wife . I really do not deserve her .
