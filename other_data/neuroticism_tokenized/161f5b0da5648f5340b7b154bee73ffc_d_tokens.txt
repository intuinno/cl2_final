You know your Hershey's bar is big enough when you have to use a knife and cutting board to eat it . :) Happy New Years !!! And there goes my size smaller jeans that I bought yesterday . 
Love is the cruelest form of affection and the sweetest form of torture . 
You walk in and my strength walks out the door , say my name and I can't fight it anymore . Oh I know I should go , but I need your touch just too damn much . Baby , you're the right kind of wrong .

cannot wait . He's gonna be here tonight . :) I love you < PROPMALE > !!! 
had an amazing weekend with her love . I love you so much < PROPMALE > . 
I've reached the only logical conclusion : love isn't supposed to make sense . It's a chemical , physical , emotional devotion , passion that we can't hold back . This ain't no thinking thing . 
Interesting fact of the day : kissing for one minute uses up 26 calories . :) 
is gonna beat < PROPMALE > . He got me addicted to Halestorm .

is so happy < PROPMALE>'s up here . Even if it was just one weekend without him , I missed him a lot . Love you darlin . 
misses him already . I love you so much darlin . See ya in about a month ( ugh ) . I LOVE YOU !!! 
: til my last breath , til I'm called on high , til the angels come and I see the light . To the very end , til I give in , to the last beat of my heart . No I can't swear that I'll be here for the rest of your life but I swear I'll love you for the rest of mine .

Today is an overall good day . It's < PROPMALE > and my eight months , and < PROPFEMALE > had her babies ! She had four , but sadly no one was in the barn and she didn't get the sack off three of them fast enough . The little girl we saved is doing amazing though .

Wish I was in your arms , lying right there beside you . I really miss you darlin , but I'm already there . I love you < PROPMALE > ! 
I have a lot of guy friends , and being who I am , I still flirt . < PROPMALE > knows this and accepts it . He knows , just as everyone else knows , that I love him . He's my one and only , so back off .

FINALLY !!! It's almost been a month , but we have another calf ... and it's a little bull !!! 
wishes decisions were easier to make . Ugh . 
may have made a mistake , but she's gotta do what's right for her . 
How come you can always give someone advice , but taking it and doing it yourself is so hard ? 
is at a red light . Might be there for a while too . 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Yearwood . Her voice , her songs ... they all make sense . 
Love , look away ! Love , look away from me . Fly , when you pass my door , Fly and get lost at sea . - Love , Look Away from Flower Drum Song .

Thanks to everyone in choir ! You made last night one of the greatest concert ever and I'm going to miss being a part of the high school concerts . And most thanks to < PROPFIRST > Brown for the amazing Director's Award she gave me last night . Love you ! 
Tough girls come from New York . Sweet girls from Alabama . But Michigan girls have fire and ice in our blood . We can ride horses , snowmobiles or four-wheelers , work all day , dance all night , and hunt with the boys . All the while making cocktails for our girls . And if when we have an opinion , you're gonna hear it !! :) ( Repost if you're a True Michigan Girl )

Because I am woman , I must make unusual efforts to succeed . If I fail , no one will say , she doesn't have what it takes . They will say , women don't have what it takes . - < PROPFEMALE > Booth Luce . 
You ever put your arms out and spin really , really fast ? Well , that's what love is like . It makes your heart race . It turns the world upside down . But if you're not careful , if you don't keep your eyes on something still , you can lose your balance . You can't see what's happening to the people around you . You can't see that you're about to fall . – < PROPFEMALE > Owens . 
In a very unusual way , I think I’m in love with you . - Unusual Way from Nine . 
will be driving < PROPFEMALE > Eagling to school tomorrow on her last full day of classes as a high schooler . Wow . 
is done . She never thought she's say this , but it's kind of depressing . She's gonna miss a LOT of people . 
Dear body , \ 
Thanks for deciding to shut down on the night of my senior lock in . You destroyed another one of my senior year moments . I hate you . \

I want you to know that it doesn't matter where we take this road , but someone's gotta go . And I want you to know that you couldn't have loved me better but I want you to move on , so I'm already gone .

Oh CMT Music Awards ... how I love you . And how I wish I could be there !

had an amazing time in Lansing . Greatest moment ? Watching < PROPFEMALE > Beaudoin become the 2010 State 4-H Goat Award winner !!! Congrats Mal ! 
loves hectic days . First the storm , then a rush to the vet office with Bubba . Poor dog . He's got a < PROPMALE > cut on his neck from God knows what and a cut on his leg from his brother attacking him . At least we got him fixed up ! 
is FINALLY a mommy again . Frosty had her babies . One < PROPMALE > and one doe . They're big and sassy ... and \mommy\ " loves them ! " 
A lot of times we want something so bad that we can’t stand not having it , to decide that it isn’t quite what we expected when we do get it . 
Eclispe with < PROPFEMALE > Beaudoin , < PROPFEMALE > Eagling , Eagling < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Eagling , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > last night , and Sweeney < PROPMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > tonight ! Can this week get any better ?

is slightly sun burnt , but finally dry . Oh water fights . < PROPFEMALE > Marzean , that seriously was one of the greatest grad parties EVER ! 
Three manure spreader loads full and the barn is FINALLY clean ! How can a barn that doesn't hold animals get so dirty ? 
is finally singing at another wedding ! YAY ! 
can't let go , and yet she can't < PROPFEMALE > on . One more < PROPMALE > to prove to her it's the right thing . Good luck .

had a very relaxing massage with Miss < PROPFEMALE > Schnell . 
found out that to have love , you have to have happiness . I didn't plan on moving on so quickly , but I found happiness after a few months of unhappiness . 
is not a happy camper . 1st off - it's raining . 2nd off - I have two tests today ( one of which I just finished ) . 3rd off - I'm sick . Gah . 
is SO excited ... < PROPFEMALE > HAD HER CALF !!! 
thinks it's sad how it only takes two weeks for something to change . 
believes this is going to be a GREAT week ! I got 100% on my math test , my english class was cancelled for the day , and my essay is coming along ... FINALLY ! AND ... I'M HEALTHY AGAIN !!! Can't wait to see what other great things will happen . 
To whomever wrote the \Hi Lacy\ " on my truck ... thanks ! I say hi back . :) \ 
\Nothing is impossible . The word itself says I'm possible . \"" 
If you have a sister who has made you laugh , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you suceed , saw you fall , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , can't do without , took clothes from your closet without asking , or loves you unconditionally , then copy and paste this as your status . \ 
I love you < PROPFEMALE > Parks ! We might not always see eye to eye , but I'm proud to call you my sister . 
had a great , and much needed , night with the girls last night ! Go see Easy A ... it's amazing ! 
is excited for the 4-H Expo and Market Sale Wrap Up meeting tonight ! 6pm at the < PROPFEMALE > Sancutary ... if you were a 4-Her that participated , you should really come . :) We're watching the video that < PROPFIRST > Centala made of the week . 
lied . The 4-H Youth Expo and Market Sale Wrap-Up Meeting is at the Great Lakes Maritime Center ... which is in the same place as mentioned before , but still . A small lie . Oops . 6 pm ! Movie ! Food ! 4-Hers of Alpena ... BE THERE ! 
A conversation in my political science class . \ 
Mr. Uppal - To have security , you have to give up some of your civil liberties . \ 
Student - What's there to secure if we have no liberties ? 
just watched the Opening Cermonies to last summer's 4-H Expo ... < PROPFEMALE > Borke and I make a pretty good team for singing the National Anthem . :) 
Do any of us really know everybody on our Facebook friend list ? Here's a task for you -- I want all my FB friends to comment on this status about how you met me . After you comment , copy this to your status ... so I can do the same to you . You'll be amazed at the results you get ! 
had an amazing time with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Eagling last night !!! 
Love is such a blind fold ... you lose reality in it . Sometimes that's a good thing , but most the time it's not . 
feels bad for Dad . He was helping Grandma out by cutting limbs off of her trees and he fell off the ladder . He's in \just a bit\ " of pain . :( " 
thinks it's officially time for the Ford to be fixed ... the radio in the Chevy is DEAD . :( 
likes it on the bedroom floor . 
loves < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Photography !!! Seriously , check him out . It's amazing ! 
Sleep or football ? Hmm ... though I may die , I think that football wins in the end . =) 
got to wear the varsity jacket . Seriously , that means more than words ever could . < PROPFIRST > , you're amazing ... I love you . 
had a blast at Hillman homecoming , then being one of the Walmart dancers . :) 
Dear Facebook Chat , \ 
Quit logging me off while I'm typing a sentence ... or recieving a message . Thanks ! \ 
An angry user . 
You don't get to choose , you just fall . 
is SO excited for tonight's girls night ... and ready to scream her head off in the haunted house !!! 
had an OUTSTANDING time last night with the girls ... even in my vocal cords are a little shot from screaming at the Haunted House then laughing at Jackass 3D ! \ 
And now ... time for Breakfast on a Farm . It's gonna be great ... come see us ! 
witnessed something amazing today : twin calves being born at Breakfast on a Farm ! Dang , that cow's timing was amazing . \ 
NOTE : For anyone that doens't breed cattle , twins are VERY uncommon . 
hopes everyone has an AMAZING time at the 83rd National FFA Convention ( Official ) ! GO ALPENA FFA !!! 
Like my status and I'll tell you : 1 . Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds 2 . The color you remind me of 3 . My first memory of you 4 . The animal you remind me of 5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you 6 . My favorite thing about you 7 . Give you a weird nickname 8 . Challenge you to post this ! :) 
just wants to cry ... and I really don't know why . Ugh . 
is watching that National FFA Convention on RFD-TV . \ 
\Stop telling yourself that you can't ask that person out ... and I'm a goat . \ " - < PROPMALE > Shipps . " 
In honor of those who continue to conquer cancer ! Put this up for 1 hour if you know someone who has or has had cancer . Many won't copy and paste . I did . Will you ? Love to those who are in the fight ! 
is debating who is worth her time and who isn't . 
has had enough of this freaking depression . I don't know what's up , but it's going to get figured out ... and soon ! 
went to the Haunted House again last night with < PROPFIRST > . :) 
In Scotland I'm just like a lot of other guys , but in < PROPFEMALE > I'm seen as a very strong , masculine guy . - < PROPMALE > Butler . \ 
Yeah , I'm moving to Scotland now if they ALL look like him . =D 
doesn't understand how one person in a family can be so different from their family members . 
is very depressed ... my little < PROPFIRST > died today . :( 
Like this status and I'll write on your wall beginning with \truth is ... \"" 
' s day started out amazing thanks to Watz-Wrgz OnAir ! Thank you for playing The Dogman ! 
can't believe she got the wool pulled over her eyes but at least it was before it hurt a precious animal . 
loves the 4-H program AND the Alpena County Fair , but right now , the citizens of Alpena that are not taking time to listen to both sides and understand what's going on are not anywhere near being loved . 
Happy Halloween everyone !!! 
doesn't like giving up , but it's getting to that point . 
is having one of those days that made you happy you got out of bed this morning . :) I love amazing days ! 
is extremely happy that things are starting to look up . :) 
has decided she needs to get rid of all her Facebook games except Bejeweled Blitz . Maybe she won't be so addicted to Facebook then . 
cannot stop smiling because of one amazing guy who just said that sweetest thing . :) Love you < PROPFIRST > ! 
and < PROPFEMALE > Eagling are planning a Benefit For < PROPMALE > Sharp . Wanna help ? Let us know right away ! 
had the most outstanding weekend EVER !!! 
... cuz I'm country strong . 
Farmers work their farms from the crack of < PROPFEMALE > , until the books are done at night . In 2010 there have been 438 farmers killed on the job in the U . S . They produce the food that keeps us alive , and 85 farmers ' children have been killed on their farms so far this year . Every meal is a good time to think of the people who made it possible .... REPOST if you're a farmer , love a farmer , appreciate farmers 
RIP Little Grace . I know our house is NEVER going to be the same without you , but I'm happy you're not suffering anymore . 
Pretty Woman ? 
has all these memories for < PROPFEMALE > Grace running through her head still . It was awkward waking up and not seeing her this morning . 
loves those days when you literally cannot stop smiling . :) 
I'm not a huge fan of < PROPMALE > Chesney , but I love this song . :) \ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W10ZVrQxJqU 
... I guess I should've been more like her . 
is DONE driving around for donations because we've hit all our stores . :) Things are looking good for the benefit . Hope everyone can make it !!! 
... < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is the biggest winner ... and < PROPFEMALE > Parks is the biggest loser . Well ... that sucks ! But at least it was a good night with great people . :) 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone !!! 
The day has finally arrived ... the Benefit For < PROPMALE > Sharp starts today at 4:00 !!! I'm so excited . :) Hope to see everyone there ! 
wants to send a HUGE thanks to everyone who came to < PROPMALE > Sharp's benefit last night ! We did something great last night , and it was a huge success ... thank you ! 
Ten < PROPFEMALE > research paper ? Ha ! You were just dominated ... by me . 
just wants to sleep . Only one more week . Thank goodness !!! Bed , you are going to see a LOT more of Miss < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
wanted everyone to know about a new Zumba class . :) 8 o'clock every Thursday at Long Rapids Hall . It's a LOT of fun !!! Cost is $5.00 per class . Hope to see you there . 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same !!! 
hates those days when the brain is running for no reason at all on things that you don't want to remember . 
may be going on a road trip this spring to visit Cricket's Kids Nubian Farm in Oberlin , Ohio !!! Anyone want to come ??? 
is loving the newest addition to my family ... a Great Pyrenees named Drift ! 
survived the first night with Drift , even though she barked ALL night ! Here's to potty-training so she doesn't have to sleep in the kennel !!! 
survived her first semester of college ! And now and month and four day break . :D 
had the most outstanding shopping trip with some pretty amazing girls today . :) 
Poor little Drift !!! She came out to help Dad and me with the chores today and almost got lost IN the snow drift !!! It's a good thing she stays close or we might lose her . 
Drift is going to be famous !!! Watch for an adorable little puppy in the Alpena News Paper . :) 
Rest in peace < PROPMALE > Sharp . You will always be loved and near to our hearts . 
thinks today should be interesting . Woke up at 3 o'clock and couldn't get back to sleep . Hopefully < PROPFEMALE>'s in a good mood ! 
just got home from singing at < PROPMALE > Sharp's Prayer Service . Wow ... even though there were four other people up there doing the same thing , that was a lot harder than expected . 
\The touch of your lips is a shock not a kiss . It's an electric twist . \ " - A Fine Frenzy " 
So much for not being sick this winter ... ugh . Stay away for the Parks house ! 
Every Christmas you hear people saying what they want and bought . Here's what I want : I want people who are sick with no cure to be cured . I want children with no families to be adopted . I want people to never have to worry about food , shelter , and heat . Now , let's see how many people actually care and repost this . 
The greatest man in History , Jesus , had no servants , yet they called Him Master , had no degree , yet they called Him Teacher , had no medicines , yet they called Him Healer , had no army , yet kings feared Him , won no military battles , yet He conquered the world , committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . He is the reason for the season ! 
is officially unpacked and moved in !!! While home is great , this one week of living by myself is pretty great . 
Decide what you want , decide what you are willing to exchange for it . Establish your priorities and go to work . - H . L . Hunt . 
made the < PROPFIRST>'s list ! Not that it's too much of a shock . If a 3.936 student wasn't on it , there'd be a problem . :P 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !!! 
got her Christmas miracle : the little sick kitten that I've been taking care of is healthy again !!! 
absolutely loves Zumba ! It may kick my butt some days , but it's helped me lose a pant size too !!! 
feels like a totally bum . I should probably be up in Hillman , but I didn't wanna drive anywhere . Hmm ... at least I'll make it there for the basketball game tomorrow . :) 
is so proud of my babe ! His team may not have won last night , but he played an amazing game . :) Love ya < PROPFIRST > ! 
can't wait to see my kids today ! I've missed them ... a lot . 
was happy to see her kids , but very unhappy to find out little < PROPMALE > has the flu . :( Crossing my fingers and praying that I'll be immune as I've already had the flu once . 
must be sick ... I'm listening to < PROPFIRST > Swift . :S Someone please shoot me ! 
Leave it to me to get sick on my last weekend before school starts back up . Ugh . At least I think the worst is over ! 
College is great , but do I LOVE being home ( even though I should be in Hillman ... sorry < PROPFIRST >!) . GO TIGERS ! 
GO TIGERS !!! Now I really regret missing the game . 
can't wait to sit back , relax , and cheer for my babe tonight . :) GO TIGERS ! 
You gotta go through a couple nightmares before you capture the dream . 
Wow ... it's hitting me a lot harder than I expected it too . :( 
To all my friends who are Sex in the City fans , please don't be upset that I changed this , but I thought of this quote today and it fit . Here's my version : I've been in a relationship with myself for nineteen years , and that's the one I need to work on . 
Well , so much for my decision to sell all my Saanen goats . I just bought myself a nice Saanen < PROPMALE > from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Pike ! Welcome to G&G Ranch < PROPMALE > ! 
So ... I have a question for everyone . Does anyone remember back when MSN Messenger was the best thing on Earth ??? I think we should start using it again . At least it wouldn't be as sucky as Facebook chat ! If you agree , like my status . 
So ... < PROPFIRST > Tutera's Texas wedding for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ? Yeah . I want it . While all of his stuff is amazing , that one fit me SO well . Maybe he can do that in Michigan ... when the time comes , obviously . :) 
feels like being completely honest today : I miss you . 
< PROPMALE > , \ 
I have mised you . Thanks for coming back into my life , even if you are reruns . \ 
? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
I blame < PROPFEMALE > Parks for my current obsession with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Messina . She HAD to mention the song \My Give-A-Damn's Busted\ " the other day ! " 
Screw the knight in shining armor . I want the country boy in boots and Wranglers ! 
Well ... here goes nothing . Zumba , please don't kick my butt anymore than needed today ... I might not survive ! 
Hey everyone . Sorry if you think I've been ignoring your texts/phone calls . I'm totally out of texts and have $ . 50 on my phone ( not even enough for a phone call)so PLEASE don't text/call me until I get ahold of you somehow ! 
believes that this past weekend was \exboyfriend piss < PROPFEMALE > off weekend . \ " Thank goodness it's over and done with ! " 
thinks that < PROPFEMALE > Sharp is the BEST adopted Mommy in the history of the world !!! 
I was just reminded that I told everyone my phone was gone ... I have it back !!! Please don't go all crazy texting me though , I'm trying to take it easy on that . 
I could write a thousand letters , call a hundred times a day or go try to drown my sorrow at the bar . I could go down to the church , get on my knees and pray , but it still won't change the ways things really are . Won't bring you back again . 
So ... I just thought of something . I haven't visited choir ... in forever . :( I miss it . 
had a much needed good time last night . :) 
Is 6:25 too early to go to bed ??? 
How much do you think it would cost to bribe a three year old to sleep all day ??? 
just saw a post on YouTube that someone thought < PROPFIRST > Swift's version of Run was better than < PROPFIRST > Strait's . Wow . That person must have been hit over the head ! NOTHING beats < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
Dear bed , \ 
It was greating getting to know you again . Let's meet again VERY soon , cuz I know I REALLY like you . :) \ 
A cancer patient only has one wish , to get better . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
sang at her second funeral today . It was a bit easier than the last one , but can't there be a wedding or something happy the next time ??? 
Drift has become the ultimate cow dog today . Sadly , she's like the rest of the dogs though : she just makes them run , and never in the direction we want them to go . So Drift , I have one request . Next time you want to make the cows run , don't make them run out of their pen . I don't like running after cows in knee deep snow . Thanks ! 
is very happy with the outcome of tonight . :) 
absolutely loves < PROPFIRST > Brown . He may be the best thing about the holidays . :) 
Dinner with the parents at Hillman's Subway ? Success ! It's been a LONG time since I've been at the best Subway in Northern Michigan ! 
Gah ... who knew finding someone that's free on Friday would be such a big deal ! 
Trip to Dundee ? Success . Selling Mozart while there ? Not so much . I think that Mozart is just destined to stay at G&G Ranch . 
went out with the family to celebrate my Grandma's 83rd birthday ! < PROPFIRST>'s is a GREAT place to eat ... especially if you don't want to eat at all for the rest of the day . I'm stuffed ! 
Sorry to everyone that's been texting me ! I ran out of my texting package again and don't have enough money on my phone to buy a new one right now . I'll let you know when I buy more though ! 
\Lacey 
This morning , I took the garabage out in my pajamas . My mother quickly informed me that I was as much of a babe as my sister . :P 
Why do I ALWAYS wait til last minute ? 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > sings ? Oh wow . That just made him even MORE attractive . 
had a great time catching up with Alpena High School Women's Chorale today . Too bad it didn't work out seeing Concert Choir . :( 
thought she had a bunch of information already printed for her cause and effect essay , then she discovered that information didn't have the information to create a works cited < PROPFEMALE > . Uh oh . It's gonna be a long day ... 
My poor < PROPFEMALE > isn't doing so great right now . :( I know she's old , but it's only been a few months since the last dog we lost ... 
< PROPFEMALE > went with < PROPFEMALE > to the clinic today . Please say a prayer for her ! 
RIP < PROPFEMALE > . It will be an adventure without you . No more cuddling on the couch or tripping over you during the day . :( 
We all bleed red , all taste rain , all fall down , lose our way . We all say words we regret , we all cry tears , we all bleed red . Sometimes we're strong , sometimes we're weak , sometimes we're hurt , it cuts deep . We live this life breath to breath . We're all the same . We all bleed red . - Bleed Red by < PROPFIRST > Dunn . 
Alpena Public is cancelled ? I don't understand . The roads aren't THAT bad ! 
The timeline of our lives starts with a date of birth and ends with the date we leave Earth , but the most important thing isn’t those dates ; it’s the dash between them . 
To all my friends that are going to State FFA Convention , have fun ! I'm totally jealous . And go < PROPFIRST > Sumerix ! I know you and your team will have an outstanding convention planned . :) 
Fairboard meeting tonight . To all my friends that want to be on the < PROPMALE > fair board , I'd appreciate it if you can make it ! I'm handing in the names and trying to get guidelines tonight . :) 
ACC , you have failed me again . :( Here I go to die on the roads ! 
had an outstanding time catching up with Miss < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > today . :) I've missed her . 
is moving to Ireland . 
went two days without Facebook ... I don't think I missed too much . 
WANTED : Strong , silent type . Must love animals , drive heavy equipment , AND give great massages . Oh yeah , and have a cool accent . :) 
Of course the day the weather is outstanding I have a full day of classes and am exhausted too . Ugh ... 8:00 , you can't come fast enough ! 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! Thirty-nine years ago today my Dad asked my Mom to marry him . Thankfully she said yes !!! 
Looking for something to do today ? Come to the Benefit for < PROPMALE > Minton at the Aplex from 4:00 to midnight and the Miss Sunrise Side < PROPFEMALE > Program 2011 at First Congregational United Church of Christ in Alpena from 6:00 to 9:00 ! 
is so proud of MY personal < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Villarreal ! She did an outstanding job last night at the Miss Sunrise Side < PROPFEMALE > Pageant . 
Uh oh ... < PROPFEMALE > wanted to look at pets today so we went to Petfinder.com . :S I'm bad ... I've found a few that I want to bring home ! I don't need another pet ... I don't need another pet ... 
Thank goodness it's spring break . Don't forget about that < PROPFIRST > Adams ! 
It's the first day of spring break and I'm feeling pretty accomplished . Math homework ? Done . Editing my english essay ? Done . All that's left is studying for my psychology test that's over a week away and doing the prelab for chemistry ! 
thinks she is obsessed with Sex in the City . 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using four words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .. Be a good sport and play along ... four words is harder than you think . 
I have a request to ask . Can everyone please say a prayer for my sister's cat Sneak ? He's an outstanding cat and he hasn't ate since Friday morning . Sneak is more than a cat and my sister is REALLY worried about him . I'd really appreciate it too ... he's one of my favorite nephews ! 
The Sneak ate again ... YAY !!! 
is SO excited ! In less than a month , G&G Ranch will have baby goats again !!! 
Please with Dad and I luck ! We're taking Drift and Zeke ( the < PROPMALE>'s cat ) into be fixed today and the Jimmer ( < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s cat ) in to be declawed ! It's gonna be an interesting morning to say the least . 
highlighted her hair today !!! It's so different , in a good way . :) 
Thanks to everyone that wrote me a scholarship letter . Stupid < PROPFEMALE > made a mistake though and forgot to get her school transcript . Crap . 
might have just saved herself ! Calling the CFNEM office to see if they'll accept a late transcript . Please , please , please , PLEASE !!! 
YAY !!! Everything is good ... I can still turn in my scholarship application !!! 
is off to Lansing for Beef Expo !!! 
had an outstanding time at Beef Expo , other than the fact that the bull I wanted went for more than I could afford . :( 
Dear Spring , \ 
I love you a lot , I really do , but you mess up the drains in my house . I do not appreciate plugged up pipes . So please , be nice to my house . I'd appreciate that a lot ! \ 
Love , \ 
So , I've decided I'm one of those high school graduates that still wants to go to high school dances . I can't decide if this is a good or bad thing . 
is sitting here with her darling little nephew , the Jimmer ! He's so cute ( so are my other nephews Punk , Ryno , and the Sneak !!! ) . 
Driving down the road and what do I see ? A herd of cattle standing in front of me ! 
Alpena never fails to amaze me . Thanks to everyone who donated towards Alpena 4-H at TSC today !!! 
Fish fry !!! SO excited . :) 
is SO full ... and < PROPMALE > Baker says there's still more fish to fry . Goodbye belt ... where are my stretchy pants ??? 
After getting home from < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s , my parents and I found a \new dog . \ " Wait til tomorrow ... it's going to be a great picture moment for Facebook ! " 
would like to let everyone know that < PROPMALE > Nicholson is the greatest good natured jerk that I've ever met . :) Love ya < PROPMALE > ! 
So , I used to be obsessed with GMH and LGMH . Now they're really hooked me ... Kids Give Me Hope ! I'll have to think of something to put on there . :) 
doesn't feel well ... at all . Ugh . 
I'm SO bad ! 4-H Youth Day is Saturday and I JUST started my project !!! AHHHHH ! 
Looking for something to do on Saturday ? Come to 4-H Youth Day !!! 10 to 2 at the < PROPFIRST > Besser Museum . There will be a petting zoo , lots of projects created by area 4-Hers , and so much more ! 
Woah . I have two Youth Day projects done and it isn't even midnight . Wait a minute ... I just thought of two more ! Dang . Something must be wrong with me this year ... I never do this many projects ! 
4-H Youth Day is here ! Come check it out at the < PROPFIRST > Besser Museum from 10 until 2 . :) 
While all my high school friends are getting ready for prom , this high school graduate is sitting at home celebrating Drift's seven month birthday ! 
Oh the joys of living in Northern Michigan . So much for dressing up in my nice spring clothes for church ! Jeans and a sweatshirt sound wonderful . 
In about a week , calving and kidding season will start at my house . I'm so excited !!! Even with the weird weather patterns , I can't wait . It's my favorite time of the year !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Parks ... you are spamming again ! It's some kind of IQ test thing and it was sent to a LOT of people . Sj Appel is sending the same thing . 
is thinking about running for Miss Sunrise Side ( not this year , but for next year ) . What do YOU think ? 
just saw pictures of a wedding done at a goat farm !!! I think I'm in love . :) 
It's amazing how going about twelve hours without heat and electricity can make you REALLY appreciate having them . The sound of my furnance kicking on might have been the best sound I've ever heard ! 
went to visit the Alpena High School Choirs today ! It felt so good to be back in that room . :) 
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time , rock you strong in these arms of mine , forget all the regrets that are bound to follow . We're like fire and gasoline ; I'm no good for you , you're no good for me . We only bring each other tears and sorrow . But tonight , I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow . 
American Degree application ? Done . Goats hooves trimmed ? Done . Laundry ? Done . Organizing in the barn ? Done . Dang ... today's been a productive day ! 
My sweet little Drift is in quite the rebellious stage right now . Last night she tried jumping up on the kitchen table and this morning I found her digging in Mom's flower garden ! Needless to say , that's not going to last for long ! 
has baby goats !!!! 
Today has just been an outstanding day . First I get an unexpected answer ( though one I REALLY wanted ! ) and then God blessed me with three outstanding baby goats . I don't think I could be happier if I tried ! 
Happy Easter everyone ! I hope that you all have an outstanding day . :) My Easter started out with waking up to see three of God's latest creations . All three are still going strong ! One has decided to be a bit stubborn and not learn how to hook on by himself , but now he's as potbellied as his siblings . Just another way to show that God is great ! 
thinks there might be some more babies at G&G Ranch before the end of today ! June looks like she's getting ready . :) 
Who's the goat girl ? Oh yeah ... that's me ! And I'm GREAT at reading my goats because guess who's having her babies as I'm typing this ? JUNE !!! Can't wait to see the rest of my baby goats . :) 
June had three healthy , brown bucks . Wish they had been does , but you deal with what you get . At least they're still cute ! 
There's nothing better than waking up knowing that baby goats are out in the barn and doing well . :) 
If everyone could PLEASE say a prayer for < PROPFEMALE > , the mother of my first set of baby goats . She became sick tonight and isn't doing very well . :( 
< PROPFEMALE>'s doing a bit better , but we're FAR from being great . She's finally drinking water again but shows no interest in food . Poor girl . I hope she gets better soon ... please continue praying ! 
is officially obssessed with Tangled . 
Rest in peace < PROPFEMALE > . I'm so sorry that I couldn't save you . Say hello to all my other babies up in goat heaven . :( 
My spirit is up a little after seeing the outstanding Wizard of Oz by the Alpena High School Masquers club and playing with my baby goats and kittens . At least I had that little bit of sunshine to go with my heartbreaking day . 
Dad and I saw a beautiful sight today . Two of the calico kittens had gone and curled up with the baby goats to sleep last night ! It was so cute . 
Well , that was a kick in the stomach . I guess I'm done chasing that one ! 
My black lab < PROPMALE > has to be one of the greatest dogs around . He came in with me to play with the baby goats and kittens today and let the goats crawl all over , and under , him and even played with the kittens ! I love that old dog . :) 
has a baby calf !!! 
< PROPFIRST > Borke , I am about to blow up your notifications by tagging your FFA Banquet album . I thought you would like a little warning . :) 
So , we don't think that our kitten's mother is taking care of them anymore , which means we're feeding them a few times a day . That means we're taking care of three kittens and three baby goats . Grandma told us we just needed a calf to bottle feed and we'd be all set ! Hahaha . 
cannot feel anything else in her body because her shoulder and ankle hurt so much . 
is officially done with her first year of college !!! Celebrate now ? Yes please ! With baby goats , kittens , and pizza for dinner !!! 
Let me rephrase that last comment . I am officially done with my first year of college . YAY !!! Now it's time to celebrate . Came home to play with my kittens and kids , and then Mom told me we're getting pizza for dinner ! There . That's MUCH better . 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and I got to go play with all my animals today . :) It was a blast ! And now , a note from < PROPFIRST > : we mostly played with the 6 baby goats and the 3 baby kittens ! it was fun ! 
In honor of Mother's Day we are trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother and keep it there till May 9 . Please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many beautiful mothers we can get on FB . \ 
I wish I had a picture of ALL my mothers though : < PROPFEMALE > Parks , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Sharp ! 
Kids and kittens played with and fed , yearling goats moved to their new pen , goat barn cleaned and the yard cleaned too . Don't you just LOVE how I spend my first day off from college and work ??? 
Calf number two born today ! 
Calf number three born today ! It was an appropriate day too since it was also the oustanding < PROPFEMALE > Smith's baby shower , which was lovely . :) 
got to sing with the Stolen Horses at the rodeo concert !!! AH !!!!!!!!! 
Happy Mother's Day to all the outstanding mothers out there ... especially mine ( biologicial and adopted) ! 
So , I was joking around with my sister yesterday saying by telling her that we need a new bottle baby calf since our last bottle baby calf is now eight years old . Guess what ? Mom might have found us a bottle baby ! Hahaha . If it does happen , I'll have three baby goats , three kittens , and a calf to raise ! Ah ! Good thing college is done for a while ! 
Calf number four born today ! G&G Farm's calving season is halfway done ... so the next four better be boys !!!! 
Has anyone ever written a letter to the editor for The Alpena News ? I'm looking for guidelines on their website but I don't see any . 
Good luck Alpena High School Choirs while you compete at State Choral Festival !!! With I could be there with you . 
is ( hopefully ) printing the final copy of her American FFA Degree ! 
American Degree sent . Please get there on time ! I don't EVER want to see that application EVER again ! 
Bull calf born today !!! AHHHH !!! I'm already in love with him . :) Also , when I went out to see him , I discovered one of my kittens had gotten herself trapped in our barn wall ( you'd have to see it to understand ) . So I went on a kitten rescue mission this morning and , thankfully , it was successful . 
Want a good meal today ? Come to Long Rapids Hall for Grace Episcopal Church's Chicken Dinner ! Four to seven . It's the best chicken in Northern Michigan ! Cost is $9.00 per person . 
I'm setting myself up for disaster . I'm pet-setting for the next week and the family only has dial-up Internet , so I've decided that I'm not going to get on the computer ALL week ( other than today ) . This should be interesting . 
is HOME !!! And boy does it feel good . :) 
So , I've updated four of my photo albums . Check out Life with the Villarreal's [ 2008-2011 ] , Kittens !, 2011 Baby Goats , and 2011 Calves for what's been going on in my life for the past week . :) 
After a little investigating on the Michigan FFA website , I discovered that when I get my American Degree this fall , I'll not only be one of the few females from Alpena FFA to get one , but also the first person from my family to get one !!! AH !!!!! 
Dad and I made and emergency trip to the vet office yesterday because < PROPMALE > and Drift decided to tangle with a porcupine . Drift's weren't too bad , she had a few under her < PROPFEMALE > , but < PROPMALE > had them in his nose and mouth . Poor puppies . Hopefully they learned their lesson ! 
So , I've never watched American Idol but with all the hype about < PROPFIRST > McCreery winning last night made me listen to him on YouTube . Damn that boy can sing ! 
HUGE update on my G&G Ranch website ... go check it out ! 
It's obviously wedding and graduation season . About every other post is about a wedding or a graduation ! AHH !!! Thank goodness I have Camella Beale's wedding to look forward to next weekend ! 
Happy Memorial Day everyone ! 
As long as this killer sunburn becomes a killer tan , I can deal with my stupidity of being outside for five hours yesterday and three hours today without sunscreen ! 
I think I'm going to have to steal one of my parents vehicles today . Mine's in the shop but I want to go visit my 2011 choir seniors for their last day at Alpena High School ! 
Looking for something to do tonight ? Come on down to the Bandshell for the first Alpena City Band concert of the summer ! Starts at 7:30 . 
My Dad is on the front < PROPFEMALE > of the newspaper today !!! 
Today marks an ending to an < PROPFEMALE > . The last originals of Apple < PROPFEMALE > Kids 4-H Club is graduating ! AH !!! Congrats to < PROPFIRST > Centala and < PROPFIRST > Worth ... and all my FFA and choir friends that graduate today ! 
< PROPFEMALE > finally had her calf !!! Now waiting on < PROPFIRST > ... 
For anyone that likes to get ahold of me by my cell phone , don't . It broke last night . Hopefully I'll be going to town later in the week to get it fixed ! 
is SO in love with The Voice ... and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . :) Season Two auditions have already begun ... what do you all think ? So I go for it ? 
Well ... we survived the storm a LOT better than our trees did . One box elder fell on one barn , our HUGE < PROPFEMALE > tree on another barn , a few apple trees down on the fence and MANY trees down on the pond . I'll post pictures later , but for now , I know what I'll be doing for the next few days ! 
Thank you to < PROPFIRST > Mcmullen and Kane < PROPFEMALE > O'Connor for all the help you've been these last few days ! I can't believe how much you've got done and it is REALLY appreciated . 
I think my heart just broke . I had kind of decided to keep Gem , my little doe that I'm bottle raising , and was going to take her ad off the Internet today and now someone is interested . I really don't want to sell her . :( 
I've decided to NOT get a new cell phone . Mine can't be fixed and I really can't afford a new one right now . Maybe when the school year starts again I'll get a new one , but for now , I'll enjoy my most recent purchase : an alarm clock ! 
I've always dreamed that love would be effortless . Like a petal falling to the ground , a dreamer following his dream - < PROPFIRST > Clarkson in Where Is Your Heart . 
In honor of Father's Day we are trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your father and keep it there till June 19 . Please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many wonderful fathers we can get on FB ! 
Be mindful what you toss away , be careful what you push away , and think hard before walking away . 
Headaches suck . :( 
May have a new home for two of my boys at Camp Innisfree ! It is run by the Girl Scouts of Southeastern Michigan . They have a farm program at their camp and have been looking for friendly Nubian wethers for almost five months with no success . Wish us luck !!! 
had a wonderful time at the CFNEM Luncheon . Thanks again to < PROPFEMALE > LeClerc < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Villarreal , and < PROPFEMALE > Sumerix Villarreal for writing those recommendation letters ! Also , < PROPFIRST > had a calf ... and it's a bull ! Baby season at my house is officially over for this year . 
Thank up Drift for waking me up at 6:00 am by chewing on a can of cat food . I LOVE getting up early on my days off . Grr ... 
Today my outstanding mother-in-law < PROPFIRST > Borke came up to me and told me that some of her friends saw her at Wal-Mart and they were worried that < PROPFIRST > was already engaged , but they decided I was an alright girl because I live in Posen and I'm in 4-H . Ha ! That seriously had to make my day . 
\April showers bring May flowers . \ " - Jordin < PROPFIRST > Gerst . \ 
So , I just realized that the two CD's I want to buy this summer ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s Red River Blue and < PROPFIRST > Young's Neon ) come out on the same day ! July 12 is going to be a great day ... except I'll have to decide which CD to listen to first ! 
Hey everyone ! Love Alpena , MI ? Then check this out ! Inspiring A-Town . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Stutzman shows us even more reasons for why Alpena is so great . 
is taking four VERY excited children and one secretly excited adult to the Huron Humane Society today ! Hopefully it all goes well . 
The humane society trip was a success ! The kids had a blast with all the cats , and Bry Bry the blind dog . Hopefully we'll be making another trip back soon to see all the dogs . :) 
First cutting square baling : DONE ! And it's not even the Fourth of July yet . 
Weird fact : On average , 12 newborns will be given to the wrong parents daily . \ 
Maybe my mom wasn't kidding when she said < PROPFEMALE > and I were messed up at the hospital ! Haha . 
Dear Drift , \ 
This 4:30 am routine you're into right now ? You know , the destroying things loud enough to wake everyone up JUST so we'll get up and eventually let you out ? It needs to stop . Firstly , I don't like my stuff being destroyed . Secondly , all the other dogs don't need to go out til 7:30 - deal with it and wait ! \ 
Your favorite owner . :) 
Happy birthday to my oustanding mother , < PROPFEMALE > Parks ! 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > as SO cute . They found out today was my Mom's birthday so they're making cards for her ! I bet she'll love them . :) 
Can anyone tell me why it is so hard to pray , but easy to swear ? Why clubs are growing and churches are shrinking ? Why it is so hard to re-post a Christian status , but easy to post gossip ? Why we can worship a celebrity , but not Jesus ? Gonna ignore this ? The Lord said , if you deny Me in front of your friends , I will deny you in front of my Father . Re-post if you're not afraid of what your friends think . 
doesn't have a computer anymore . Thank goodness for free time in the mornings at work . If you need to get ahold of me , the only way is through my house phone now . 
is looking forward to a very entertaining week with the FBI ( Farm Brats Inc) ! 
has the most amazing sister EVER ! She got me a new phone !!! 
was going to take the Villarreal kids to The Farm so they can play on the 4-wheelers , but with the look of that sky , it's gonna wait until Friday now . 
Lost one of June's babies from pneumonia . Make sure to keep an eye on your pets with this weird weather . It's very easy for them to get sick . :( 
It's official !!! I'm a recipient of the American FFA Degree !!!! YAY !!!! 
My year is 2006 . \ 
I lived in Posen , MI . \

Favorite movie : Step Up and Flicka . \ 
Dislikes : The fact I was a freshman ! \

While getting ready to come to work this morning , something popped into my head . When I'M waking up to head to work , my sister is finally getting to come home . When I'M going to bed at night , she's going to work . Dang . 
A year ago today I thought that I had my BEAUTIFUL buckling Mozart sold to a lady ( if she can be called that ) in Texas . We later found out that he was sick . Today , I'm doing the tests to see how many of my other goats have what he had . I don't even have the results yet and my heart is already breaking . :( 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > for winning BOTH Small and Large Animal Sweepstakes at the Montmorency 4-H Fair ! Alpena 4-Hers ... watch out . We have competiton ! 
A good friend asked me the other day if I was a slow healer . I had to think about it for a while , then I replied , \Nope . I just injure myself faster than I heal ! \ " Haha . " 
My Disney movie : Sleeping Beauty\ 
Favorite character : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ... duh ! \ 
Least favorite : < PROPMALE > ss < PROPFEMALE > ! Stupid girl ... should have listened to your < PROPFEMALE > godmothers , not Maleficent . \

Favorite scene : When < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > escapes Maleficent's castle . \ 
Like and I will give you a Disney movie 
is beginning to think that she doesn't have the heart to be a farmer anymore ... 
After a night of talking to a good friend , thinking about the kind things that people have said to me , having my amazing dog < PROPMALE > run up to me as soon as I came outside , and thinking about every great moment I've had with my animals , I think I've finally calmed down enough to realize I was being silly last night . Thank you everyone for being there for me ! 
The Alpena County Fair starts today !!! I'm torn between happiness and sadness . I LOVE the fair , but this is my last year as a 4-Her . Uh oh ... time for me to get some Kleenex ... by the end of the week , there's gonna be a lot of tears running down my face ! 
Hunk ( my steer ) has certainly made things interested for my last year at fair . Yesterday he was attempting to squeeze the other competition to death between the wall and a gate and then he tore the wash rack apart so the water in the cattle barn had to be shut off . Then today , I came into to barn to find one of his ropes undone . To make everything better , he slipped his halter off while we were washing him ! Praying tomorrow during the show he'll actually behave ! haha . 
hopes to see everyone at the Alpena County Fair ... especially today at 3:00 during the cattle show ! 
Alright everyone ! Get your checkbooks out and get ready to bid . Today's the day ! Come to the 4-H Market Sale ! 5:00 pm at the Alpena County Fair ! 
Tomorrow's my last day with Hunk . :( I think that's the one thing I won't miss about 4-H . Having to say goodbye to my steer at the end of fair week . 
< PROPFEMALE > is back out with our cows and my Hunk is gone . :( I thought I'd have this morning with him , but when I got to the fairgrounds they had already loaded him up . Between that and the finalization that I'm finished with my last year of 4-H , I'm crying . Growing up stinks ! 
is loving being back with the most adorable Claire-bear in the whole world !!! 
On September 24 there is a talent show at the Elk Fest ( Atlanta ) . If anyone is interested , send me an email . I'll send you as much information as I can ! 
? For the husband who told his wife I love you one last time before his plane went down in a field ? For the wife who stopped in the stairs to call her husband to say I will love you forever ? For the mothers and fathers who kissed their kids goodbye the morning they died ? For the policemen who rushed in with the firemen to help get others out only to die themselves ? For the soldiers who fought back and lost their lives . ? Today , tomorrow , ten years from now we will remember ? 
BEAUTIFUL truck and handsome boy driving said truck + < PROPFEMALE > = what ? That's right . A drooling < PROPFEMALE > ! Even better when you happen to know the boy too . :) 
just applied for a new job ... wish me luck !!! 
is going to sing in an actual choir as an actual member for the first time since graduation . Dang . This could be interesting ! 
is SO excited for Sunday . Grace Episcopal Church ( aka , my church ) is hosting the St. < PROPFIRST>'s Gospel Choir from Flint , MI ! If you've never heard them , you should come out ... they are fantastic ! 
can't find her partner for Intro to Social Work ... ughhhhh . 
Yay for mild ear infections , sore throats , colds , fevers , and headaches ... NOT . I'm officially sick enough that I had to go to the doctors for the first time in two years . Ughhhhh . Time for a hot shower , Vernor's and popcorn ( a Parks family cure-all ) , and bed . 
Happy Birthday to my truly outstanding father !!! And to make it even better , Happy Anniversary to the greatest parents I could ever ask for !!! 
just thought of this . It's October , which means Halloween is soon . Which means ... The Dogman should be on the radio soon !!!! 
in thirteen days I'll be ... ( deep breath to start singing ) back home again in Indiana ! :) Can't wait for National FFA Convention !!! 
had a wonderful time with < PROPFEMALE > at the Huron Humane Society ! She found a little dog named Pepe who she fell in love with , and of course , she's in love with ALL the kitties . There are so many GREAT animals there ! If you're looking for another animal to share your life with , head over there ! You won't regret it . 
Dear Long Rapids Rd construction workers , \ 
Please don't take any longer than your two week estimation on fixing Long Rapids Rd . I really don't like driving M-32 . Long Rapids is SO much better ! \ 
Thanks ! 
Hello , my name is exhaustion . My best friend is a pillow and a comfortable bed , which I will gladly meet around 8 o'clock tonight ! 
just realized that a week from today , my FFA career will be over . :( \ 
Also , hope everyone has an oustanding time at the Rhode family reunion ! Wish I could be there with you . 
leaving for National FFA Convention in the morning ... I can't wait !!! 
is home from my last National FFA Convention as an FFA member . While I AM happy to be home , it's bittersweet to say that . 
Happy birthday to my outstanding sister , Miss < PROPFEMALE > Parks and to one of my bosses , < PROPMALE > Villarreal !!! 
Sold my truck and two calves yesterday ! YAY !!! 
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight . Just a touch of the fire burning so bright . I don't wanna mess this thing up . I don't wanna push too far . Just a shot in the dark that you just might , be the one I've been waiting for my whole life . So baby I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight . 
Why do I even bother ? 
looked at pictures of Silver and < PROPFEMALE > today and has been in a funk ever since . I miss them . :( 
Anyone else having issues with Verizon texting today ? None of my texts will go through . :( 
Holy cow ! I couldn't sleep so I decided to check out some Michigan goat herds for some new possibilites . I just found one farm that sells their kids for $2000 ! Boy , isn't it nice to dream . 
I'm going to live in Germany for four months !!! 
had a great dinner with Mom , < PROPFEMALE > Parks , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > last night ! It was definately worth missing class for . :) 
refuses to admit that she just saw snow . It was just very thick rain . 
There are two strangers who will always voluntarily give their lives to save yours . One is Jesus Christ , the other is the American Soldier . Thank them everyday . 
Once in a lifetime you'll open up your heart . Maybe once in a lifetime you'll swear to never be apart . You think your love's on solid ground then out of the blue it all comes tumbling down . Help me understand why I'm not a part of your plan ? And you don't need me anymore ? Help me understand why I still want to be where you are , even though I know in my heart you don't love me anymore ? 
I may not be much to look at but I have nice fishing poles and guns - < PROPMALE > Baker . Oh < PROPMALE > y ... Love you ! 
Happy St. Antler's Day !!! Good luck hunters . :)
