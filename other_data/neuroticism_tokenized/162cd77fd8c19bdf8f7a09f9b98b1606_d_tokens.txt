Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Miller I finally have a photo profile . 

Monday's are depressing enough without it being so crappy outside too ! 
I meditate , I burn candles , I drink green tea .... AND still I want to smack someone ! And it's only 10:30 am ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s office has NO AC ! It's sort of like working in a F .... g sauna . 
Thank god we have AC again ! No more sticking to stuff . 
Will the weekend never get here ? 
What a great day ! For the first time in years I don't have to spend the day being a hypocrite ! It feels marvelous ! 
Girls Day/Night out is finally here .!
