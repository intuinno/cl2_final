The hobbit you just called fat ? He's skipping 2nd breakfast . The dwarf woman you called ugly ? She spends hours braiding her beard so you can differentiate her from a dwarf man . The Uruk-Hai you just killed ? He's been abused by Saruman . See that Gollum creature with the gagly limbs&large eyes ? For 500 years the Ring poisoned his mind . That Elf you just made fun of for crying ? She just lost her wizard friend to a Balrog . Repost this if you're against bullying in Middle Earth

On September 31st 2011 , Facebook will start charging you for your account . This was confirmed on the news ! To avoid this , you MUST get NAKED , stand on your dining room table and do the Macarena , all while singing I Will Survive . Then , and only then , will < PROPFIRST > Zuckerberg come down your chimney to tell you that your account will stay free . Pass it on , it must be true because someone on Facebook I hardly know told me . 
Hitman . This movie's gonna be sick !
