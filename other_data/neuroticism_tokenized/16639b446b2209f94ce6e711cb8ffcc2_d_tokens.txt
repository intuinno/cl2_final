baby's heart beat was 146 today , (: \ 
new doctor on monday & it's almost time for the glucose test . 
college , college , college . 
i thought that part of being in college meant that the answers to an exam are NOT handed to you , word for word . some people in my intro to the family class , who are NOT freshman , need to grow up & learn to take responsibility for themselves . jeez . 
advising at 2 & then off to save a lot , (: \

< PROPMALE > potter ! (: 
i HATE to wait , :/ 
mighty ducks , makes me feel like a little kid again , (:

can NOT wait until tomorrow , (: 
happy thanksgiving , (: 
wow , 98 days is NOT a very long time . 
driving around on a saturday night , you made fun of me for singing my song (: 
From November 21 to December 1 change your profile picture to a cartoon of your childhood and invite your friends to do the same \The goal of the game ? You see no human face on Facebook but an invasion of memories for the fight to STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN " 
FINALLY , sheesh ! \ 
When a girl cries for a guy , it means she really misses him . But when a guy cries for a girl , it means no one can love that girl more than him . 
one more to go , thank you Jesus . \ 
& then back to drip rock , (: 
-she may be confused about a lot of things ; but she knows the only time she's truly happy is when she's with him . 
love doesn't mean you'll never break up or fight ; it means you'll always find a way back together , (: 
plans for the night-cancelled . \ 
thank you wonderful tokico for taking my boy away , :( \ 
but , it's a good thing i suppose . 
but in my heart , i'm always somewhere with you (: 
i've got my heart set on you and that's not changing for anyone , (: 
all i have watched for two days straight is < PROPMALE > potter , (: \ 
that's the plus side of being sick . 
When you're around someone so much , for so long , they become a part of you , and when they change or go away , you don't know who you are without them . 
i have no motivation for college at this point . 
i've learned that it takes years to build up trust and it takes only suspicion , not proof , to destroy it . 
I've made mistakes in my life . i've let people take advantage of me , and i've accepted way less than i deserve . but i've learned from my bad choices , and even though there are some things i can never get back , and people who will never be sorry , i'll know better next time , and i won't settle for anything less than what i deserve . 
wonderful night , (: \ 
now off to deal with the crazies . 
REALLY needs to be studying for finals . 
You fight with the most important people in your life because those are the relationships worth fighting for . 
tired of winter & it hasn't even OFFICIALLY started yet . 
first semester of college - OVER . \ 
doctor & christmas shopping in the morning , (: 
he's a gonna be a chubby baby , (: 
two hours or so to go , hopefully (: 
I live where the kids are high and the grades are low , \ 
if you have a secret here , everyone knows . 
what a wonderful christmas present , poison < PROPFEMALE > & swollen eye . 
Sometimes you love something so much that it hurts to leave it , but you must . Sometimes it hurts too much to hold on to that thing you love . And sometimes you let go of what you love because it hurts , but then just sometimes ... you get it back and live happily ever after . 
snow snow , go away ! 
65 days seems so far away , :/ 
Maybe it fell apart for a reason . Maybe it fell apart to show us how in love we used to be .. so we could start over again . 
doctor , look at a car , & save a lot tomorrow (: 
back to the doctor on wednesday , (: 
looking back & at what i've been through ; i'd be a mess if i didn't have you . 
Too positive to be doubtful , too optimistic to be fearful , and too determined to be defeated . 
back to the baby doctor i go , (: 
baby's heartbeat was 152 , (: 
goooodnight , (: 
a rumor is just one person trying to make themselves feel better about their flaws . 
32 weeks & 2 days = 54 days to go . \ 
holy cow , (: 
off to save a lot i go , (: 
it wouldn't hurt my feelings at ALL if it never snowed again for the rest of my life . (: 
thinks it's kinda pointless to drive to eastern in the snow for a full 40 minutes . 
thanks everybody for the birthday wishes , (: \ 
19 & 7 weeks to go ! 
Life flies by , so you have to embrace it . Forget the past , because you cannot erase it . So live the dream , and learn to < PROPMALE > it .

five o ' clock seems so far away ! :/ 
pineapple , (: 
baby doctor at 3:15 then to wonderful save a lot for my last day of work , (: 
There are two reasons why people don't talk about something : Either it doesn't mean anything to them , or it means everything .

& his momma done it all WITHOUT an epidural !
