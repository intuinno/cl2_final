R . I . P < PROPFIRST > Jennings . 

got nominated to attend the National Youth Leadership Forum on Law and Crime Scene Investigation . I don't know if I'll go though . Gotta have money for it . 
lets not pretend that im invisible because it only hurts . not like it matters to you but it does to me . 
i have contacts now ! 
is it so wrong to want to be loved and accepted for who i am ? apparently it is so therefore im just over it . life is too short to be playing mind games . if you like somebody then dont be chicken and not tell them . 
feeling pretty good . went to fuzzys pizza party then chilled with the fam . at < PROPFEMALE>'s . ;) love ' em lots . 
sup ppls . lol . im sittin here chillin with the frodo at my house . yayness . today is gonna be a good day . [ even though im running on barely any sleep ] whoop whoop to the fam .! 
isnt these shots supposed to not allow you to get sick ? then why do i feel like crap ? 
Somedays I'd rather be invisible and then others I'd rather be noticed . I'd rather be held when I weep then cry alone . Somedays I'd rather just walk in other peoples shoes and see things through their eyes , but most of the time I'm glad I'm me . 
just got my first tat . reminds me of when i got my eyebrow done . Whoop Whoop ! I am inked . 
sick and tired of two-faced backstabbers . 
i still like him A LOT . and it hurts some to look around and see all these happy couples getting each other presents and sharing love . loneliness sucks . :,( 
kinda pathetic when you cant wait to go to work just to get away from an older sibling that thinks they are above you . 
what's with all the double letters on made up words ? smexii ? boyy ? LMAO wow . 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH . im so sick of ppl moving in . just once i wish ppl would just stop and ask how i feel on it . it may not be my house but this just makes me wanna leave and go to a hotel just to get away . 
funny thing is that im not alone anymore and im happily in a relationship . the other funny thing is ive been drinking nothing but fuze and lost 5 lbs already 
i can actually smile now without fear of losing it to a frown 
of course when i get mad my friends always cheer me up . i love ya guys . 
ill smile when i get to be in your arms once more . otherwise there is nothing to smile about . 
i got my first w2's today . now i just gotta do my taxes and send them in . love you baby . love ya < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . 
I miss you like the sun misses the sky at night . I miss you like a fat kid that has already ate his cake . I miss you like Gir misses his cupcake . I miss you like Nemo missed his dad . 
im finding out more and more on what friends have hidden from me and to be honest im disappointed 
here i forgot ... fixed . \i wish kayley was here right now . i could use a good laugh . i wish i was in < PROPMALE>'s arms right now . i could use the comfort . i wish < PROPFEMALE > was here . I could use a loser . lmao . i love ya . and yes . all 3 of you mean so much to me . \"" 
loving how people can say something one minute and turn around and what they said they werent gonna do . tired of being told lies . 
feeling like poop ... wait , that's probably because of allergies . going to work . yay ... 
hope he can come home . :( 
sitting here wondering when things changed . we each have changed . more with distance , more with maturity , more with life and love . we have all grown up . our fates have begun to straighten out and our paths have been chosen . just know that ill always be your sister , yiour daughter , your friend , your girlfriend . i love y'all and good night .
