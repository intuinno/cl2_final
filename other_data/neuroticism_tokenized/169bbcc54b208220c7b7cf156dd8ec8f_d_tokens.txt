I can't imagine what it was like when my Mom woke up and saw the face of Jesus as He reached out His hand for her and said welcome home . I must continue to remind myself that we are the ones who are away and by Gods grace through faith we shall be home again with her someday . My mom greatest gift to all of us was her unconditional Love . I realize now that part of her will live with us to share with each other forever

I'm not ashamed !! AMEN 
Please Pray for friends of ours from church , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFIRST > went into surgery around 4am for his Lung Transplant .

< PROPMALE > 23:44 -46 \ 
It was now about the sixth hour , and darkness enveloped the whole land and earth until the ninth hour , While the sun's light faded or was darkened ; and the curtain of the < PROPFEMALE > was torn in two And Jesus , crying out with a loud voice , said , Father , into Your hands I commit My spirit ! And with these words , He expired . 
Mt 28 : 5-6 The Angel said to the women , do not be afraid , for iI know who you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified . He is not here He has risen , just as He said . 
Had a great week-end away with very special friends and family too ...
