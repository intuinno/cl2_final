Ahaaa can't believe I figured out a way to write my psychology paper about surfing ... 
never pick a fight with someone when you're not smart enough to understand their comebacks .... 
After what happened at cooking club today , I'm seriously considering attending frisbee club and honor society club meetings for the rest of the wednesdays this semester . 
Just watched the animated movie Ratatouille .... I swear Pixar used < PROPFIRST > Speranza as inspiration for the main character ..

Surf's coming . I feel it in my bones . 
\Ethan likes This Formspring Question led to the SUICIDE of a 15-year-old girl . \ " is proof that we need the \ " is a fan of\ " phrase back . " 
Cute Spanish girl behind the counter at Burger < PROPMALE > kept smiling at me ... I think she made my meal a size larger than I ordered . o_0 
I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn . I'm surrounded by imposters everywhere I turn . I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn . Am I the only one who noticed ? I can't be the only one who's learned ! 
I'm seeing waves when I close my eyes ... 
I'm going to run after every frisbee today . 
Hate catching the first wave of a set and getting hammered inside for 10 minutes . The surf was mad choppy but the waves were actually pretty good . Hmm I also applied at 6 restaurants today . Somebody's gotta call me back ! 
Call me a clown ... I'll laugh . I don't care . Call me a paddleboarder .... oh it's on ! 
I'm using a sock as a bookmark because I lost the other one .

Out on the ocean you will find a little peace of mind anytime . 
But my breath fogged up the glass , so I < PROPFIRST > a new face and laughed . 
These kids think they're so cool blasting rap in their moms ' mini vans ... \ 
\Put your hands up\ " is such a cliche hip hop lyric .. It's gotta be because these artists are so used to running from cops and then they get caught and write their songs in prison ... " 
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly ... 
Mopping is a man's job . 
Gotta catch a wave ... Gotta do it and feel allright . 
Speak the truth , and leave immediately after . 
Lord , please send a tropical low up the atlantic , resulting in clean , slightly overhead , left-breaking waves this weekend . Amen =) 
Finallly some sweet waves . Thank God .. I was about to go crazy . Flat for 2 weeks . 
Sheesh , surfing is easy . All you need to know is WHEN TO HOLD YOUR BREATH

Wow last night I had a nightmare that I was in my baking class and there was a quiz , I didn't do the reading , I forgot what my cleaning duties were , and I didn't have my roses . 
O give thanks unto the LORD ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth forever .

Killer surf session at my secret spot .. ALL BY MYSELF 
Sooo I don't usually copy and paste mass statuses and post it as my own , but this one could turn out interesting ... \ 
\Valentines Day is coming !! Put this as your status and anyone that wants to be your < PROPFIRST > will send a heart ? to your inbox \"" 
Catch a wave ; emancipate your mind . 
I hate when \all of the above\ " or \ " none of the above\ " is an answer choice ... " 
I'm tired of all this white ... I wanna see some green . 
Strawberry Haagen Dazs ..... Yeahhhhhhh man . 
Winter nights are too long .. 
Slash was cool but Usher ? No .
