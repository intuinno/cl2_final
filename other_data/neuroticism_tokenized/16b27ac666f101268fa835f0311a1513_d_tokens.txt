Missing < PROPMALE > Loomis , hoping he loves and misses me too :(

Effing ALS homework . LOVE IT ! HAHAHA not ... 
Stoked that I graduate in a week and I have no homework tonight ! Maybe I can get some sleep ! 
Posting the color of your bra made the news BUT WILL THIS ? Lets SUPPORT our Troops . If you support our Troops then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour . There should be no excuses from anyone !!!!! This should appear in everyone's status ! Please do this for the ones that make this the Land of the FREE !

Well I guess I can announce what I'm having now . It's . A . ( See comment below ) ........ 
Missed her husband's phone call . By like half of a nano second . I hate myself so bad right now ... good night FB . 
In honor of Valentines Day ~ Post a picture of you and your spouse/significant other , and tell how long you have been together ! ** Blessed with < PROPMALE > as my best friend for 3 1/2 years . Married for 3 years . Yes , we're fast burners ! LOL ! ** 
I have the most amazing husband ever ! I got flowers , a balloon , and a < PROPMALE > ! I love you < PROPMALE > Loomis ! 
I am oficially over everything . Thanks for playing . 
Watching the Torrez boys and doing laundry and dishes , I'm up to 7 loads ! WTF how can one kid go through so many towels , bed sheets , and clothes ?! I know how ... but still ! Is it twice as bad with two kids ?! 
Knows what I want to give up for lent ... but is it considered cheating since < PROPMALE > isn't here ? 
I would love for people to stop telling me I have dirt on my forehead . Please educate yourselves . Mardi Gras isn't on a random Tues of the year , McDonald doesn't have a sale on fish filet sandwhiches every Friday for weeks before Easter for no reason , and Ash Wednesday is called Ash Wednesday because practicing Catholics wear Ash on their forehead ... on one Wednesday out of the year . Thank you . 
Forgot to get the Lido with Epi and a patient bled ... and bled ... and bled ... where is my mind ?! I lost it ! It was a small mole removal , I was still mad at myself though . Captain < PROPFIRST > just laughed at me and called me a retard :/ 
Can't wait to take a bubble bath and slip into my 1200 thread count sheets to watch Rescue Me and wait for < PROPMALE > Loomis to call . I love my husband . :) 
Wishing I could vent to someone ... anyone about my bad week . :( But who can I turn to after my best friend lets me down ? 
Is wondering what in the hell < PROPFEMALE > is doing in there ! It's ok ... I don't need my ribs :( 
Click ' Like\ if I have ever made you smile in your life . Then set this as your status and see how many people you've made smile . :) " 
My nephew Izaac Justice Sadler arrived today ! 9 lbs 11 oz ! My sister in law is a CHAMP ! Congrats < PROPFEMALE > Sadler and < PROPFIRST > C . Sadler ! < PROPMALE > Loomis and I can't wait to meet him this summer ! We love and miss you guys ! :D <3 
President Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011 . This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973 ! Nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation , while war is fought in 2 theatres , our men and women in uniform get a LOWER pay increase than WELFARE RECIPIENTS . 
So tired . Missing my hubby . Love you < PROPMALE > ! 
Is so incredibly lost right now ... I just want my sanity back . And my heart . Thank you . 
Missing my husband , glad things worked out :) Silly blondes , you girls are gross . Dont ' you know brunettes do it SO much better ? 
still doesn't know what to think . 
So over life . Not going out of my way to deal with anything anymore . Whatever . 
:) Loves my husband < PROPMALE > Loomis , my son Christian , and all my friends . There's too many of ya'll to tag . You know who you are , and I appreciate each and every one of you ! 
Really wants Coco's curry . FML . 
Thinking about deleting my FB account . Too much drama and petty bullshit for my taste . I hate that people think I should censor my thoughts , personal life , or political views . If you don't like it , then please remove me as a friend . I could care less . 
Today is a yucky day . That is all . 
OMG ! I WANT TO CLAW MY EYES OUT ! I JUST CAME ACROSS SOME HORRIFYING SHIT WHILE TRYING TO DO A FRIEND SEARCH ! I'M TOO SCARED TO EVEN POST THE LINK ! 
Can't wait to have this baby , drop this weight , and look sexxi for my husband again :) 
Lucky to have an amazing husband like < PROPMALE > Loomis . I love him so much ! :D 40 more days baby ! 
Bra colors made FaceBook news BUT WILL THIS ? Lets support our firefighters and EMS . If you support our Firefighters and EMS then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour . There should be no excuses from anyone !! This ... should appear in everyone's status !!!! God bless our Firefighters and EMS !! 
OMG I put on Staff Sergeant tomorrow . I hope SSgt April Adams Paciotti and SSgt < PROPFEMALE > Lear Perschke don't punch me too hard . :) NCO paycheck here I come ! 
Getting ready to go to my promotion ceremony . :) HAHA half you haters didn't think I'd even make Staff ! First time bitches ! 
OK so my Blackberry is dead . If anyone has tried texting me , or Blackberry Messaging me , I am so sorry . This is especially for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hill and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . I am not ignoring you ! I am just clumsy as hell and lost my trackball ! We all know that my BB won't work without it either . I can still make and recieve calls . <3 you guys ! 
After a lengthy discussion with my dad and my husband , I have decided that I'm seperating from the military shortly after the birth of our daughter . I'm sad to leave a proud heritage and not being able to say \I serve my country\ " anymore . Looks like I need to start looking into colleges :) Thank you for all the love and support I have recieved while making this heartbreaking decision . Daycare is just too expensive ! " 
<3 ' s < PROPMALE > Loomis . 
About to go to Boise with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sullivan and < PROPFEMALE > Splain to look at wedding dresses with beautiful Bride-to-be < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hill ! :) 
Yeah ... pretty much over it ... 
Can't wait to share a bed with my love < PROPMALE > Loomis again . I'm being abused by a thrashing two year old who has no sense of space , grinds his teeth , and thinks that my bed is his . 
Hoping this tylenol takes the edge off . Rawr . I hope everyone knows , pregnant or not , I will RUN to save your dying ass . :) - P.S. if there's no one really dying , it is perfectly acceptable and encouraged to announce MOCK code blue . :D Thanks ! 
Loves what FB did to my profile picture . Oh , and now I can't change it . Thanks alot Bin Laden . 
Had a really good night . Talked to my love < PROPMALE > Loomis , also got to catch up with some old friends . It's been too long :) Good night FB ! 
Had a really good talk with my sister in law < PROPFEMALE > Sadler . In a great mood now . Love you Nome ! <3 
Had a great day ! I don't know what I'd do without the support of my really good friends during this deployment . Christian is finally moved into his bedroom and the nursery furniture is all put together . It finally looks like a baby's room ! :D I feel so blessed . 
So ready to see my husband and have this baby . Preferrably in that order :D 
Marriage does not promise eternal romance , just eternal love and commitment . Marriage cannot prevent disappointments , disillusionment , or grief , but it can offer hope , acceptance , and comfort . -- Be true to your love ... the love you chose to spend the rest of your life with ... don't take them for granted ... respect and honor the love you 2 share ! ? I love you < PROPMALE > Loomis ! 
Just uploaded a ton of new pics . Enjoi . <3 
Wishes I didn't feel like crap so I can make my kiddo a decent dinner :( corn dogs and chips are okay right ? 
Sick . Christian is sick . Got bad news not one but TWICE today . And I missed ACLS class and will officially expire at the end of the month . I hate you stomach flu , and I hate you North Korea . 
Feels like I'm inhaling water with every breath and like a leprechaun did a jig on my head wearing iron clogs last night . WTF ?! I was doing so good with not being sick too ! FML . 
I traded eyeliner for dark circles , salon haircuts for ponytails , designer jeans for sweat pants , long showers for hairy legs , late nights out for early mornings , designer purses for diaper bags and I wouldn't change a thing .! I love my babies ! Repost this if you don't care what you gave up and will continue to give up for your children . 
YAY ! My wonderful husband is buying me True Blood season 2 ! Something good came out of his ass being in Korea :) 
Can't wait until the ... oh wait ... what day is it again < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sullivan ? It seems like at one point or another May 1 through the 14 were all supposed to be the day . Hmm .... let's ask dyslexic < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hill . Maybe her dinosaur knows ! 
Is convinced that I have the most active baby . Ever . I didn't think babies could move that much in utero ! I guess she'll be one busy baby when she get's here :) 
Can't wait for tonight ! Going out with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hill , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sullivan and < PROPFEMALE > Torrez for a much needed break after a rough week ! 
So I'm sitting at the UCC and I'm on Facebook . WTH . 
First day I haven't talked to < PROPMALE > this whole deployment . It makes me sick when I don't talk to him :( I love and miss him so much . 
Is throwing in the towel . I can't deal with it anymore . 
Would love to hear from my husband sometime before next weekend . I guess that's too much to ask . I'm not worth the effort :( 
Getting harassed at work for eating fish . I think this is an MEO issue ... lol . 
So glad my friend made it here safely ! Now I'm hoping he doesn't get lost on the way to my house ... Lol !

These friends pick upjust like they spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been orhow far apart they live . REPOST this if you are lucky enough to have ...... at least one friend like this . I love my military friends and the few civilian friends I have that understand :)

This week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried , but never met , or those we have held but could not take home . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it because unlike cancer , baby loss is still ... a taboo subject , break the silence ! In memory of all the angels who are gone , but not forgotten !!! 
Falling asleep listening to Muse's undisclosed desires . Amazing song :) good night fb fam bam !

Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it let's cut down congress pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue ... raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree ! 
Not at the table < PROPFIRST > . 
Scentsy party tomorrow ! 2 pm ! 
Black ops xbox Starryeyed0122 if you're feeling lucky ;) 
Spanking some serious ass in WAW . I forgot how awesome I was at it :D 
Misses my family so bad it makes my tummy hurt :( I have no idea why I was in such a rush to get out of the house when I was younger ... 5 years and 1 overseas tour later and I still need my mommy and daddy and sister . 
I'm pretty sure AFI is the most amazing band . Ever . <3<3<3 
Don't tread on me . 
Had a blast tonight ! :D 
Change\ 
your profile pic to a cartoon from your childhood , and invite your \ 
friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6th ) , there should be no \ 
human faces on Facebook but a stash of memories . This is to help raise \ 
awareness for eliminating violence against children .

Firefighters , EMT's , Paramedics , & Law Enforcement Officers of all kinds work the streets day & night to keep people safe . They are missing their family to care for yours . In 2010 , there were 85 firefighters , 39 EMS and 160 police officers killed in the line of duty . Re-post this if you are a firefighter , EMT , Paramedic , or Law Enforcement Officer , love one , or appreciate one , or just take a moment to thank them ! 
Feels like I'm having an identity crisis . I am thankful for the few good friends I have . I need to reevaluate my whole life ... its a New me resolution ! 
Holy crap ... who knew throwing up was such a good workout ? That's my positive spin on my reason for being sore \/" 
<3 
Just chopped off all my hair ... 
Loving my life ! Grateful for my amazing friends and family . You guys are amazing ! 
I wish I could get through an episode of Hoarders without getting up and cleaning halfway through the show \/" 
Dear left ovary , \ 
You are all I have left . Please behave yourself . This sucks ! \ 
Love , me . 
Who do you think you are ? Running ' round leaving scars ? Collecting your jar of hearts , tearing love apart . You're gonna catch a cold , from the ice inside your soul . Don't come back to me , who do you think you are ? 
To all my friends who are health care providers ! One of my dogs just ate a bottle of zoloft , are they gonna die ?!?! 
Sammi needs to kick rocks . 
Filed my state taxes today :) can't wait for my 6.5 grand ! 
4 years ago today I married my best friend . We promised to make it work , no matter what . He's held me , wiped away my tears , and made all my worries melt away with one kiss . They said we wouldn't make it , but we're stronger than ever . I love you < PROPMALE > ! 
Please pray for our fallen Gunfighter . He was also an Ammo troop . :( 
Dear Headache . \ 
GO AWAY ! \ 
That is all . 
Ok . Let's get one thing straight . I work . That's right . WORK . I am NOT the wife to sit around at home and wash dishes and cook and clean all day . Not that I would mind doing that , but I don't have that luxury . I have an obligation to my country . If I am not at home with the kids with dinner ready and dishes washed when you want me to be then your ass can stay at home and do it your damn self . 
Beer . 
I'm going to be sick . These guys on animal hoarders kept dead puppies in their fridge , put them in onesies , and buried them . Cmon people , really ? Only if ghost adventures were on tonight I wouldn't be watching that mess . 
Sooo , my big redneck wedding just might be my new guilty pleasure . I feel so bad for laughing ... 
Dear whomever invented the term \sleep like a baby . \ " You suck . And you've obviously never had a baby . " 
Well played algebra . Just when I thought I understood , you had to go and confuse me alllll over again . Asshole . 
Exhausted . Cross fit is no joke . Oh well , can't live on the beach this summer looking like this ! 
Coming to Oklahoma this April :D I would love to see all my high school friends ! Cold beer , dirt roads and warm nights ? Yes please . 
Wants my right arm amputated . Any takers ? Oh the collarbone must go with it . Thanks . 
GO PACK GO ! STUCK THE FEELERS ! 
Miserable is the understatement of the year . :( 
Air Force Blues ... one more reason to hate Monday . 
Matts iPhone is amazing . I want one :( 
Pee test . Yipee ! I love the awkwardness in the room . 
Has a headache and needs a drink :( worst day I've had in a really long time . Oh well , just keep swimming right ? :) 
Can someone please fill me in ? These profile pics for a fallen firefighter have me worried ... :( 
My prayers and thoughts are with Kadena's fire family . I am so sorry for your loss . Stay strong guys . Rip . 
Dear ammo , \ 
I hate you and your double standards . You are screwing up my life . 
Packing . April 1st couldn't come any faster . I'm so done with this place and all of its crap . 
So depressed I can't even sleep :( 
Idaho cops are assholes . Especially the one behind me writing me a ticket . Could my week get any worse ? 
Happy vday to all my fellow american insomniacs and to everyone else all over the world celebrating it :) 
Wow . Talk about a crazy Valentines day ... Guess who's pregnant ?..... Just when we thought it was impossible . Mazel tov to the Loomis clan !

They say you can't appreciate the sun without a little rain , but cmon now . When is the never ending downpour going to stop ? I feel so lost ... 
Thanks for all the loving comments on the photos everybody ! God has truly blessed me with an amazing husband , wonderful children ( most days ) and the best friends a girl could ever ask for ! :D <3 
What's everyone up to today ? :) 
In a few weeks I get to see one of my bestest friends in the world and my family and friends in Oklahoma ! Hopefully I will get a < PROPMALE > to show my husband how we party out in the country and show him the backroads ! Then off to < PROPFEMALE > , I will def miss everyone here in Moho , but I'd be lying if I said I could wait to leave Idaho :) 
Ugh . Algebra . 
Is it just me or is the bathroom in the education center slightly reminiscent of Top Gun ? Everytime I come around the corner I half expect to see < PROPMALE > cruise in his whiter tighties shaving over the sink and < PROPFIRST > Kilmer staring at him with bedroom eyes ... 
Snow on winter sports day , we are still going to attempt to go to Boise to go ice skating with little man , hopefully we don't skate all over I-84 on the way up there or back . Wish us luck ! :D

Keeping all my friends in japan , Korea , Guam , and Hawaii in my prayers ! Stay safe and get to the freaking hills !! 
Worried :( prayers for the lives lost in japan . To all my family in the Philippines please stay safe and lmk you are ok please !! 
So let me get this straight , when a man hurts your feelings , you are supposed to accept his half assed apology , and listen to his roundabout explanation of why the whole situation is your fault to begin with , and just go on pretending like everything is perfect , right ? Eff that . 
Ugh . I think my angry birds slingshot is defective . It's not letting me kill any pigs ! 
#tweet me ! Forgot my password to my other account :/ lillooloo87 :)
