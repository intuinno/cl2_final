dont take life for granted for you might miss your blessing 
lLife starts off with broken roads but as you grow youll see your path and look for the one that was always there for you to walk . 
i love you < PROPFIRST > with all god will allow and one day we will be together 
DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY 
THE PAIN WILL GO AWAY WHEN YOU FEEL THE WHISPER OF THE WING
