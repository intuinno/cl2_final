says \Jesus please heal my back !!! \"" 
says \Jesus is healing and He healed my back ! I felt his power and I felt warmth overwhelm my body ! I love Him so much <3 He is my docter ! \"" 
is ready for the beach trip !!!! So excited to go on vaca with the best team in the world !!! woo hoo 180 !! 
is tired of people's concept and thought of Jesus as only a man who loved and didn't offend anyone ... He is the balance of both ... the LION and the LAMB . I wish they could all see that Jesus IS a radical man who didn't care what other's thought , but instead followed God's will no matter what it was-A man that IS holy and pure and causes others to either want to change or despise the truth 
today was a blast !!! learned so much <3 I LOVE JESUS !!! DONT YOU !!!!!??????!!!!!

hahaha whoops <3 
Today was amazing .. something totally different . I can't find the words to describe what happened today . I CAN'T FIND ANY WORDS ... This is a walk that we should never despise -- it is a priviledge that we are unworthy to have . HOW can we do this walk in the flesh ?? We can't! it will always lead us away from Him ... it will ALWAYS cause us to lose ... to die ...
