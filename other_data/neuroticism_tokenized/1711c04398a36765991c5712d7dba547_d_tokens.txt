Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't but it's mental health week and 1 ... in 3 of us will suffer , at some point in our lives 
like this status and I'll tell you a like , dislike , first impression , and a confession about you . ;] 
There comes a time\ 
in life when you walk away from all the pointless drama and people who\ 
create it , and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard\ 
that you forget the bad and focus on the good . Life is too short to be\ 
anything but HAPPY . Repost if you agree , I just did :) 
No ... We are definitely NOT sisters . 
Warm apple pies and navy seals will be the death of me ... 
If you saw me in the back of a police car , what \

In\ 
memory of every cancer patient , family member , and friend who has lost \

They said everlasting friends can go long periods of the time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types kind of friends pick up like they have spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand ... that life is busy ... But you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least one of these friends .

Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice- people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ?....? Promote LOVE & Acceptance , not hate ! Remember to wear purple today ...

At some point , you have to make a decision . Boundaries don't keep other people out . They fence you in . Life is messy . That's just how we're made . So , you can WASTE your life drawing lines or you can LIVE your life crossing them . It's your choice . - < PROPFEMALE > Grey , Greys Anatomy
