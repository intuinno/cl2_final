i can't decide whether the moments that make me hate high school out weigh the ones that make me wish it would never end ... 
i can't wait till these last eight weeks are over with .. graduation <3 
The reasons why small towns extremely suck : 1 . There is never anything to do . 2 . When you find something to do , its way more entertaining than it should be . 3 . We watch way to many movies . 4 . You have way to much time to think . 5 . You spend more gas getting fast food than you actually do on the food . And the list could go on forever ... 
I do not want to get up extra early on friday of all days .. blehhh . But the fact that i can sleep in Saturday makes it oh so worth it <3
