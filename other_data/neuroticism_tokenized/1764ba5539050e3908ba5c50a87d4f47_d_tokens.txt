I know it makes me a baby but ... pray for me . I miss my family so terribly . I'm sure my mother isn't much better , but just pray for us . I've never felt so misplaced and scared in my life . ( By the way , my mother doesn't have facebook . So don't tell her how much I miss her . It'll just make her cry more and I couldn't do that to her . Thanks . ) Please pray .

Someone help lift this state of mine , because I'm in an impossible state of mind . This is the kind of broken , we don't speak of . 
We keep complaining that we're blind , but we continue to cover our eyes until we get what we see , those things we think we need . We can't wait for tomorrow , but refuse the rest of today .

Aren't we proud of ourselves ?

Sometimes it's hard to understand the why . And even though my sight is dim , I think it's better than walking blindly , right ? So I'm struck by the complete injustice of my mother being sick ... again . Hasn't she had more than her share ? My great 250 ... hasn't she ? 
I'm done . 
Momma , I don't know who is who . I've forgotten who I am , and what I need to do . Where there once was a vision , there is now something new ... and it's not good , Momma , but I've forgotten what to do ...

You knew my name as if you'd said it a 1,000 times , and each word you said seemed to rhyme in a perfectly mirrored < PROPFEMALE > that molded my minds comprehension of the here and now . I took a breath , counted to three , and opened my eyes only to see you were still here with me , and these beautiful things hadn't been a dream . The beauty was in the reality and not the imagination , and I was made whole by that realization . 
And you were just a fairytale like all the ones before .... 
Why have I not been to bed yet ...? * sigh *

This is an interesting game . I wanna play . Inbox me a number . And I'll post a status with a story or something about you via your number so it's technically anonymous . 
#23 You were true to yourself alot of the time even when it was hard . I always admired that about you , but I never really said anything . And you did for sure look like simba in the DR ... don't even lie . :) 
#28 We have a tendency to lose touch and then when we find ourselves back together , it's just plain awesomeness . We bond on a level that only blood could , and yet there is much more to learn . I can't wait to go lunar bowling again . But I think we should have a block party first . ^^ 
#21 ... Girl .... You and me ... Have been apart for too long for sure . You were the peanut to my butter , the apple to my sauce , the green to my grass . And we've just shift to such different people ... I can't wait to see how these new people relate . 
#127 Smart , funny , and gorgeous with so much potential . You're mature beyond your years . Don't get caught up in the stupid every day stuff . You're better than that . You know it . Act like it . You're worth love , attention , affection , and a future . Go for it . 
#20 I've known you for almost 8 years now , isn't that crazy ? And I've watched you go through so many changes to become the person you are . And that person is awesome ! I can't wait to see what else you've got in store , because you never cease to amaze me . <3 
Number , number , who's got a number ? 
#5253 Alive ' 06 was where I learned you were an incredible person . And ever since , I've been continually amazed by the gifts that God has given you . You put a smile on my face when I see you , and I never doubt that you're genuine . That's rare , and it's treasured . God Bless .
