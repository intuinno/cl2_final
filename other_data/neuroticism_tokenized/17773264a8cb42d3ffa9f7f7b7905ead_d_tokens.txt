Last night of work for awhile ! 
What a great bang for one last amazing night off . Now back to work we go . 
Burlesque tomorrow ! 
Night of the Demons remake was pretty damn good ! A few things I would have changed but a creative piece in it's own . A great Halloween or fun movie to kick back and relax . HIghlight the dance scene with < PROPFEMALE > . Plus great music and good special effects . Better than the original ? So hard to compare .. Have to see the 1987 again . 
Were creatures of the underworld , we can't afford to love . 
Can't wait to get Aqua Teen Hunger Force vol 7 .. I need the filling of Master Shake , Frylock and cute adorable Meatwad . :) Number 1 in the hood G .

Wow what great days off ! Got everything I wanted at mall . Some guy wanted to know where Aqua Teen Hunger Force was at .. i said over there in that corner . Look and behold he wanted the last volume that I had . I felt bad .. not really . :) 
Wow literally one of the worse nights ever at work . To drunks , rude and needy guests , to even extra work . But still was able to manage to complete everything . :) 
Now time to watch Detroit Rock City and snuggle with baby J on this supposedly rainy day and drift off to slumber . 
A much better night with a early breakfast with my friend < PROPMALE > . Good way to end the night .
