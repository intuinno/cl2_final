Today , while I was brushing my teeth , a certain thought occurred to me . We all say we want to go to Hogwarts , right ? Yet , many of us live in the United States . I've got a strong hunch that there is a North American School of Wizardy and it is now my mission to discover its location and receive a late admission . Who's with me ? MLIM . 
going to see When In Rome tonight ! 
well I went to the doctor this morning and apparently my finger is now broken :/ 
When the fith < PROPMALE > Potter movie came out , my friend and I went to the midnight premier dressed as the characters . There was a huge line formed behind a sign that read \Muggles wait here\ " . The person in charge let us cut everyone because we clearly werent muggles . MLIM "
