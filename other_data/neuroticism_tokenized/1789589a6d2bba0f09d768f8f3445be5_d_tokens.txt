living , growing , changing , evolving ... 
... What makes 2012 such a great movie to watch ? 
Just came home from open house . 
Working late night , not that we hate light . Just feels right , that's when tracks come out tight . Thoughts start creeping , people are sleeping . Pull words out of the dreams , it's the deep end . 
godspeed you black emperor 
I wonder what's going to happen tomorrow ... 
imeem 
people who are helpless , we try to show them love and civilization , because civilization didn't flow the river nile . it flowed down the river nile ... 
I think I just realized what fml means .
