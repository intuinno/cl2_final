TO NON-PET OWNERS who visit our homes and complain about our pets . 1 ) They live here , you don't . 2 ) If you don't want their hair on your clothes , stay off the furniture . That's why they call it ' Fur'-niture . 3 ) Chances are , I love my pets more then I like you . 4 ) To you , they are animals . To me , they are my family who are hairy , walk on all fours & don't talk back ! Re-post if you love your pets !
