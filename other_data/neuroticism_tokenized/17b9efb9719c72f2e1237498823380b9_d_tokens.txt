i think i can .. i think .. zzzzzzz ... i can .... zzzzz ... i .... zzzz ... 
bedtime .. definitely bedtime .. day off tomorrow .. thank goodness ! 
so , I spoke to a guy I know yesterday and found out that some young chic had hit him and his father at about 90mph and that his father died at the scene in his arms . Lessons learned .. ALWAYS tell the people you love , that you love them .. because you never know what can happen , and don't drive like a maniac .. nothing is worth risking your life , or the lives of others . So , sad ): 
dreaming about a pretty < PROPFEMALE > .. 
out of work , heading to Albany for some continuing < PROPMALE > .. then the fam and friends start arriving tomorrow .. maybe .. just maybe some relaxing .. I think I ne < PROPMALE > a glass of wine .. 
home invasion !.. < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , Ally , 10 birdies , < PROPFEMALE > .. and the 3 of us .. I have to say .. it's quite funny .. the birdies talkin ' .. people talkin ' .. good times (: 
so sad , everyone is leaving today .. and back to work .. it was a great weekend with fam , friends and birdies galore ! 
somehow a snuggly cockatoo makes you forget about your day at work .. ahhhhhhh (:

off to play with the Ithacans ! 
even the chompy green yellow-nape < PROPFIRST > is being somewhat well behaved .. I think he knows I've had a rough day .. 
workin in town , being optimisitic .. < PROPFEMALE > s chattering downstairs \hello .. hahahaha .. hello ... whaaar .. how are you .. hello ... hi .. whaaar ... hahahaha .. ouch ... good bird .. \ " I love < PROPFEMALE > chatter (: "

procrastinating .. trying to get motivated to go to work .. esp . when the boys are sleeping .. well .. except for < PROPFIRST > .. clanging his cow bells in his cage (: 
Workin ' in < PROPFEMALE > for 12 today .. would rather be under the warm covers .. 
home safe and sound .. a day off tomorrow .. that makes me warm and fuzzy inside (: 
there's no business like SNOW business ..

pot o ' sauce in the crock .. birdies clangin ' their bells , < PROPMALE > sleepin ' .. < PROPFIRST > should be sleepin ' .. but won't .. and gosh darn it .. I wish that warm fuzzy not so nice feeling like I'm getting sick will go away in my face . Hmmm .. maybe all that garlic in the sauce will help (: 
off to bed .. Parrot palooza tomorrow in Jersey with my flock from < PROPFEMALE > ! 
you know you're getting old when .. you clench so you don't pee your pants when you sneeze .. and then you end up tweeking out your back instead .. priceless .. if this is 33 .. I'm scared for my 40s (: 
off to bed .. < PROPFIRST > the crazy amazon decided it would be a good idea to try to dislocate my knuckle .. ice , ibuprofen and hopefully it won't hurt to type .. bad bird .. bad bird .. 
off to < PROPFEMALE > for a 12 .. 
hmm .. day off .. party at < PROPFIRST>'s school .. < PROPFEMALE > lovin ' .. doggie huggin ' .. sounds like a great plan to me ! 
chicky soup for the soul .. mmmmmmm 
< PROPFIRST > the crazy amazon vs stuffed target dog .. I think < PROPFIRST > is winning ! 
flu flu go away .. this rph does not want to play ! 
hmmm .. maybe if I give the non-diabetic patients lots of < PROPFEMALE > today at work .. they will be friendly ?.. I'm sure work will be a MADHOUSE with all the people last minute halloween shopping .. Let's cross our fingers for a good day ! 
After a rough start with the angry shark , we had a successful halloweening jaunt with < PROPFIRST > .. and < PROPMALE > the hotdog . He just ate enough < PROPFEMALE > for about 10 people .. too bad daddy is going to have to stay up with him when it all \kicks in\ " LOL .. I'm getting my sleep so I can hand out big people < PROPFEMALE > at the pharmacy tomorrow ! (: " 
so .. now I'm thinkin ' that a cowtail , and a mini butterfinger wasn't such a good idea before I have any real food in my stomach this morning .. uuugh ... darn halloween < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I love a good snuggly cockatoo in the morning .. (:

my day off .. < PROPMALE > has house cleaning .. grocery shoppin ' , garden tillin ' and only god knows what else planned .. like I said .. my \day off\ " (: " 
Frustration : going to make a batch of homemade chocolate chip cookies , having the butter all melted .. then realizing you are COMPLETLY out of flour . Gratitude : your husband offering to go to the store without even asking to buy the flour . Thats love (: 
off to work .. bye bye birdies 
off to Scranton in the am to pick up my 24lb fresh bird .. and no .. it's not alive you wise guys .. 
I love when < PROPFIRST > my crazy amazon doen't know you are listening .. and chatters away for an hour .. I feel like a little kid hiding at the top of the stairs .. being sooo quiet .. so I can listen to him and he doesn't stop ... I've always been a sucker for \birdie talk\ " :) " 
so , we are sitting at the dinner table .. and < PROPFIRST > says to Earle .. \What's peace ? I'm not playing your games\ " .. in his little sarcastic < PROPFIRST > 5 year old voice .. ohhhhh boy ... " 
she works hard for the money ( da dum .. da dum .. ) so hard for it < PROPFEMALE > ( da dum .. da dum ) .. she works hard for the money so you better treat her right .. Let's pray for a decent day without gobble heads all you rphs out there !

sooo ... you know you have a sinus infection when 1 ) you blow your nose , and fluid comes out your eye and 2 ) when you push on that same eye .. it squeaks like a dog toy .. and on that note .. I am going back to bed 
bark bark bark .. bark bark bark ... grrrrrrrrrr ...... 
engine engine number 9 .. on the New York Transit line .. if that train goes off the track ..... 
Good night all .. this sicko is going to attempt sleep .. bark bark ... Ithaca tomorrow .. blah ... 
just thinkin ' ... 
off to bed .. sweet dreams everyone .. 
\picture perfect memories .. scattered all around the floor .. reaching for the phone ' cause I can't fight it anymore .. \"" 
gold < PROPFEMALE > for < PROPMALE > .. he is going to drive to < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow to work for his wife that has the plague so I can get some rest .. despite < PROPFEMALE > ting 7 overnights in a row on Monday .. suppose I should make him some extra special dinner tomorrow .. 
Plague girl can't sleep .. bark bark .. wheeze .. gasp gasp .. I'm scared what I'm going to deal with in the future .. if my lungs have been getting this awful since I was a child .. gives new meaning to \scarred for life\ " .. sniffle sniffle .. " 
Sooo ... im washing the dishes .. and I feel < PROPFEMALE > at my feet ( the BG macaw ) .. she gets up on my arm .. starts flapping her wings .. thinking I'm running her a bath .. then she climbs up the stairs and comes in the office to get me .. Enough with the hints < PROPFEMALE > .. I guess its shower time ! She's so emotional .. I think she thinks she's human .. 
Irony : big macaw in warm shower while chicken soup cooking on the stove .. (: 
off to bed .. workin ' in < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow with the plague ): 
omg it is -1 outside ... I DON'T WANNA GO TO WORK !! 
ok , so it was 1998 I believe .. and this kid that worked at the CVS I worked at says .. \Hey you look like < PROPFEMALE > Holmes ! \ " .. and I said .. who the heck is that ?.. That would back when Dawson's Creek was on ( which I didn't watch ) I think I need to lose a hell of a lot of weight to look like that now ! " 
It's Doppelgänger week on Facebook ; change your profile picture to someone famous ( actor , musician , athlete , etc . ) you have been told you look like . After you update your profile with your twin or switched at birth photo then cut/paste this to your status . 
this girl is toast .. and going to bed .. another 12 tomorrow .. in < PROPFEMALE > .. zzzzzzzzzzzz 
did you ever find yourself eating a waffle while typing on the computer .. and realize you actually have your eyes closed because .. quite honestly you aren't really awake yet ?.. I suppose that is not a good sigh ... 
night all .. 
The beautiful thing about being able to taste after a few weeks of being unable to taste anything .. is that everything tastes so much better .. oh yeah .. < PROPMALE > crab on the stove (:

bronchitis girl .. after being defeated .. is going to the doctor today .. guess I'll be coming home with another bag of drugs ): 
off to bed .. prednisone be kind .. I'm not in the mood for your crap .. 
Bird people .. I'm torn .. want to buy a larger home for my B&G macaw < PROPFEMALE > .. can't decide between a huge dome top .. or the huge corner cage with the flat top .. any thoughts ? She does love to stuff herself into my YN Amazon's dome top .. hmmmm .... 
when the dog and husband is in the same room .. and you smell a fart .. and he tells you that it isn't him .. do you believe him ?.. 
suppose I should clean up this place .. suppose I should get dinner .. suppose I should be resting .. yup .. the heck with grocery shopping .. I'm ordering a pizza .. 
off to bed .. hoping for sleep .. dreaming of everything that is important to me :) 
darn lungs ): 
off to Scranton to Grandma < PROPFEMALE>'s to stock the fridge .. just wishing this plague would go away so I can be conscious today . I'm thinking a Maroni's pizza might ease my pain :) 
Groceries for Grandma < PROPFEMALE > .. $350 .. new pants for < PROPFIRST > because he put holes in all of his , $70 . Finally finding a spectacular deal on a purple patent leather piece of heaven at the Coach outlet .. ok , so maybe not priceless ... but damn .. it made me happy ! 
is it really Monday already ?.. blah blah blah .... 
hoping the snow holds off long enough for a safe commute home from Ithaca tomorrow .. I suspect the methadone mammas will be driving us crazy ! 
wow .. the Reome family actually all has a day off together .. what are the chances ? I smell a big pot-o-chili in our future ! 
ironic :( def ) when your bird .. calls your dog .. by name .. 
thats right .. I said it .. I am going to go take a NAP !! 
So I now realize , that when the Reome's stay home .. it is just an excuse to pig out .. homemade chili .. now < PROPMALE > is making homemade calzones .. and I totally think I'm treating myself to a delish steak and cheese .. I think we are going to fell ill later .. hmmm ... maybe a side of hot wings too ?.. hell if you're gonna be bad .. why not go all out ! 
< PROPFIRST > just saw a commercial on The Disney Channel about Haiti .. he said \hey mommy .. we talk about Haiti\ " . I think kindergarten is amazing now .. computer class .. world events .. I don't seem to remember anything like this when I was 5 .. blows my mind sometimes .. " 
uuugh .. Ithaca .. and the prednisone wasn't kind last night .. I really need to go back to bed .. that commute is not going to be my idea of a good time today ): 
so .. < PROPFIRST > ( wb caique ) is mad at me after her vet trip yesterday .. hand swelling ... ouch !.. I think it's time for some frozen peas on this one .. grrrr ... 
so do you ever find that there is something beeping in the house .. and you aren't sure what it is .. but it drives you crazy .. but yet you wait .. because you secretly hope someone else will find the source and MAKE THE MADNESS STOP ??.. or am I just losing my mind ..?? :) 
working all weekend ): at least I have a little husband/birdie bonding time before work .. 
got spanked at work today .. thank god < PROPMALE > made dinner .. nothin ' like a big hunk of meat to cure ya ! 
off to bed soon .. must re-energize for another fun filled day of drug dealing on < PROPFIRST>'s day .. gee .. I'm the luckiest girl in the world .. at least < PROPMALE > is making a Mexican fiesta for dinner tomorrow .. homemade guacamole ! OLE ! 
12 in < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow .. supposed to snow .. fantastic .. I love a snowy commute .. 
just keep swimming ... just keep swimming .. just keep swimming swimming swimming .. 
though shall muster up some energy to go bounce with the Ithacans .. 
zzzzzz ... Ithaca ... 
back to Ithaca .. I think I'm on auto pilot .. 
Can't wait to go to Bird Paradise in NJ tomorrow with the fam to get the flock some new toys .. and pet all the feathered friends .. such a great stress reliever ! Maybe that should be their motto .. \cuddle with a cockatoo .. the new xanax\ " .. lol ! " 
Had a FAB-U-LOUS day in NJ with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Ally .. played with the birdies .. got some awesome toys .. had some pre-birthday lunch with < PROPFEMALE > .. beautiful sunshine outside .. and for this .. I am grateful :)

12 hrs of retail hell before the \snow hurricane\ " hits .. lord give me strength to get through this day .. ' cause you know .. all those peps with 2 weeks of meds left will start freakin ' out if they don't get their early refills .. grrr ... " 
wow .. that is some heavy snow .. 
heading back out into el blizzardo to shovel .. man I wish < PROPMALE > was home .. guess I should have learned how to fire up that bad ass snowblower .. 
Dear Mother Nature , This is Mrs. Reome . I can't find any gloves , or a hat .. and my homemade Babushka keeps getting blown off my head from the darn winds up here on the mountain .. can you please keep it down ?.. who ticked you off anyway ?.. thanks .. 
Worrying about < PROPMALE>'s drive into work .. snow plow .. where < PROPMALE > thou ? 
let the dog out at 6am .. couldn't figure out why he wouldn't go off the deck .. um .. yeah .. then I realized the drift was about 3 ft high at the bottom of the stairs .. oh dear .. luckily I tossed him out the front door , he did his \thang\ " and I lured him back with some crunchy munchy treats ! " 
I really wish < PROPMALE > would stop giving the birds whole cloves of garlic .. nothing like picking up your cockatoo to snuggle .. and she reeks of garlic .. when you expect her to smell like a cinnamon stick .. uuuughhh ... 
I just saw a peak of something crazy ... THE SUN !!! 
Back to NJ tomorrow for some < PROPFEMALE > bonding time with < PROPFEMALE > .. this time .. I am definitely going to give that baby < PROPFEMALE > some love ! 
looking forward to a great day in NJ with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > and Ally .. :)

off to bed to catch up on some much needed sleep :) sweet dreams everyone 
rph poll .. was today awful for you guys out there ?.. my two stores hit almost record < PROPFIRST > today .. 1st of month .. monday .. wtf ?? 
Thinking if I took a huge pay cut and opened up a bird sanctuary of my dreams , that I would have a more enjoyable career ... and it would be WORTH IT 
Ithaca .. 
last day in Ithaca for awhile .. bitter sweet .. 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s cage all de-pooped .. ready for the drive to MD tomorrow after work .. then the Phoenix Landing Luau on Saturday .. I'll be sad to see the little tweets go .. but I think this is a big < PROPFEMALE > household (<PROPMALE>'s words .. lol .. ) awweeeuuuuwwweeeeeuu !!

Great weekend in MD with family .. as always , too short .. 5 hr drive home .. got locked out of house .. luckily friend met us with key .. time for bed now . I should add that < PROPFIRST > is playing with the giant microbes we bought .. he asked if he could sleep with MRSA and Lyme Disease .. hahahahahaha !! 
< PROPFIRST > is bringing MRSA and Lyme Disease to school with him today . He said he wants to go \online and buy ALL THE GERMS\ " .. only my boy .. " 
Good night all .. this rph is toast .. and needs some rest to gear up for another fun filled 12 tomorrow .. 
nice .. can't sleep .. came to play on facebook .. and the dog follows me in here and FARTS ... can't a girl get a break ? 
Beef barley soup almost done , sick < PROPFIRST > and mommy heading to bed .. < PROPFIRST > just said \his voice is giving him a headache\ " .. poor sick guy .. darn phlem .. " 
ahhh .. here we go again .. can't sleep due to phlem attack .. come in office and \methane\ " .. yes .. I am giving < PROPFEMALE > a new name .. is back at it again ... I think I'm gonna barf .. " 
oh boy , what a night .. < PROPFEMALE > fell of her Java perch , broke a HUGE blood feather in her tail , blood dripping .. raced home from work ( had just closed the pharmacy ) .. < PROPMALE > had cornstarch and towel ready .. plucked it out .. doused it in cornstarch , and the bleeding stopped really quick . Thank god .. been terrified of that happening for years .. < PROPFEMALE > was such a good girl .. 
oh dear .. < PROPFIRST>'s fever over 102 .. it's been a long night .. poor pumpkin :( 
Hoping tomorrow we wake to an < PROPFIRST > fever free day .. I'm having flashbacks to his first few years of life where this seemed to be the \norm \".." 
Excited to soon to be the new adoptive mommy to a GW macaw named < PROPFEMALE > , and a B&G macaw named < PROPMALE > . Unfortunately their current owners parents have been stricken ill , and wish for someone to give them all the love they deserve since they no longer have the time they wish they could devote to them . We can't wait ! Time to start moving the leather couches ! 
So .. I thought < PROPFIRST > was better .. but had the fever tonight .. when pray tell with this bug go away ? It is not like my little man to not want to eat me out of house and home .. 
Dear perpetual phlem ball in < PROPFIRST > and my throat , please go away .. you have been annoying us since last week , and though we admire your persistance , your presence is no longer welcome here . We would just like to snuggle without almost puking on each other .. Thanks , Sincerely , Mrs. Reome 
I need to have a positive status today .. ... ... ... I think I'll go snuggle with < PROPFIRST > .. he looks darling with his new haircut and is being very sweet :) 
so .. fish died .. left house with my shirt on inside out .. hope the chiropractor didn't notice .. and I haven't even been at work yet .. so .. it's gonna be another one of THOSE days eh ?... BRING IT ON !! 
one more day .. one more day .. YOU CAN DO IT !!! 
< PROPMALE > off to work , and we are off to bed . Road trip to NJ tomorrow to play with < PROPFEMALE > .. get to meet up with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and Ally .. always a good time :) 
birds all chatting .. competing for attention .. < PROPFIRST > in the tub .. < PROPMALE > passing out from coming off of nights .. who do I tend to first ... hmmmm ... 
Heading to < PROPFIRST>'s open house at school tonight .. < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > my need adoptees are home safely ,.. still adjusting to their new home .. but doing great :) 
So .. < PROPFIRST > screamed and yelled and stomped his feet , and cried , and said he was too scared to go into the school for the open house . By far , the worst behaved child there . Took us 20 < PROPFEMALE > just to drag him in the door . He said he hates school and doesn't want anyone to look at him . His teacher was shocked as he is always so well behaved in school . What is going on in my little boy's < PROPFEMALE > d ? 
So they just passed a health care plan written by a committee whose chairman says he didn't understand it , passed by a Congress that exempts themselves from it , signed by a president who smokes , with funding administered by a treasury chief who didn't pay his taxes , all to be overseen by a surgeon general who is obese ,...... and financed by a country that's broke ? Feel free to repost this if you agree .. I did ! 
Working the weekend .. would rather be home with the flock n ' fam .. 
Ithaca today .. wow .. it's been awhile 
Its Monday .. and I'm off .. :) dropped < PROPFIRST > off at school .. lots of cleaning to do , but I think I'm going to take a snooze first .. yeah .. that's what I'm talking about ! 
long day in Vestal today .. booooo 
oh yes I almost forgot .. another fish croaked .. tried to play Nemo and got sucked to the side of the filter .. good god .. that thing has some suction ! ;) 
Had a great night out to dinner with my sweet friend < PROPFEMALE > who came in from Texas . < PROPFIRST > was scared at first , then had a blast . He said he wanted to follow her home :) 
work till 9 tonight , then 2 days off .. yippe ! 
a beautiful day off .. and for this .. I am grateful :) 
< PROPFEMALE > and treats for Easter $40 , Lego fire truck $20 . < PROPFIRST > saying you are the coolest mom ever as you spend 2 hours putting said fire truck together .. PRICELESS :) Happy Easter everyone ! 
One more day then a 3 day weekend ... YIPPEEEEEEE !!!! 
Addicts ( adj ) def : fools who stand outside Best Buy together under an umbrella in the dark so they can smoke a cigarette in 50 mph winds and horrific downpours .. Seriously .. get a grip or some Chantix people ... 
Hey Phoenix Landing friends .. go to < PROPFEMALE>'s Creations fan < PROPFEMALE > and vote for PL to get a % of her sales for this weekend ! 
and for those of you that didn't see < PROPMALE>'s post .. we went to a BMets game tonight .. yes , it was 38 degrees and snowing .. but the interesting part .. < PROPFIRST > says to the guy riding a fake horse handing out free hot dogs .. \HEY !! Give me a hot dog ya BASTARD !! \ " 1 ) no I don't know where he got that from 2 ) I'm not sure I want to know where he learned that from 3 ) It just better not be < PROPMALE > when I'm not home .. good god .. " 
Monday morning procrastinating .. 
yippe ! Glee is back !! 
I was explaining to < PROPFIRST > this morning that at 32 degrees stuff freezes .. he said .. \like a popsicle ? \ " so I said yes .. and he said \ " I wish I could freeze into a popsicle so I can lick myself\ " .. enough said ... ohhhh < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >..." 
still trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up .. 
< PROPFIRST > -ism of the evening .. scenario .. < PROPFIRST > talking to my tech < PROPFIRST > .. \your mouth is inappropriate\ " .. then he asked if < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > were \ " together\ " when they walked out of work together .. hmmmmmm .... " 
would rather lay in bed than go to work all weekend .. but then I wouldn't be able to pay for the bed right ? ;) 
At applebees .. I really wish < PROPFIRST > would stop saying the spinach and artichoke dip looks like bird poo 
< PROPMALE > won't stop snoring .. I'm sure he must be bruised by now .. suppose I should act dumb when he complains he is sore all over tomorrow .. Hey , I can't help it if the remote is made of hard plastic \WHACK !! WHACK !!.. Seriously .. how many times to you have to beat someone before they stop ? And why is it that the people that snore fall asleep the fastest and sleep the soundest ?.. " 
I am retreating to the spare bedroom .. for the Earleasaurus is snorin ' .. at least he got some flonase today .. and for this , I am grateful .. now .. if only it will help .. 
considering it is 10 minutes from tomorrow .. I suppose I really should get some sleep .. 
Off for some snugglin ' time with the boys .. then the 8 day stretch begins .. bleh .. 
< PROPFIRST > ism 101 : scenario : he is laying down in bed and has well .. something sticking up in his underpants .. so he grabs it makes it stand straight up .. and I say .. what are you doing !!?? and he says .. \making him stand up for the pledge of allegiance\ " once again .. oh < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >..." 
8:10 pm .. < PROPFIRST > comes in the office .. shaking his naked .. well .. self .. and singing ..... then goes and gets a shark .. and is making the shark sing \gimme that filet-o-fish .. gimme that fish .. \ " yup .. sounds about right .. one nakey boy .. and one shark in the tub now ! " 
goodnight facebook friends .. off to bed :) sweet dreams !! 
somehow work isn't as bad to drag yourself to when it is a miserable day outside :) 
power out at my Target ... oh my ... 
I don't mind going out of my way to help people at work .. in fact .. I usually enjoy it . All I require is a simple token of gratitude .. \thank you\ " .. it is amazing how in this day and age .. it seems so difficult for people to say . This hurts my soul :( " 
Adamism 101 : He comes in the office with no underpants on , bends over .. pulls his butt cheeks apart and goes .. \MOMMY !!! I THINK I HAVE A RASH !! LOOK !!!! \ " .. the joys of motherhood .. " 
so Mr. Rash just wrote made me a card that says \mom is bud\ " .. I said what is that ?? He said .. \ " mom is bad\ " .. so I said why am I bad ?.. he said because I wasn't saving the Earth .. so I said .. \ " what do you mean\ " ... and he told me I didn't help him clean the cans off the table .. so .. I guess I am \ " bud\ " Mr. Rash .. excuuuuuuuuse ... meeee ... He told me that I am to be \ " really good\ " tomorrow .. " 
Why do old men wear cologne that smells like insect repellent ? 
day 8 of 9 .. done .. AND I'M NOT COOKING .. so , the Reome family is going out to din-din before < PROPMALE > works overnights . : 0 ) 
At tgi fridays .. < PROPFIRST > was just going potty and shakin his groove thang to rusted root ... hmmmm ... 
I think my back has finally decided it can't take this profession anymore .. Day 9 is a short day tomorrow .. but sticking an ice pak down the back of your pants while working is not my idea of a thrill .. Guess I should buy < PROPFEMALE > a new ice pak ;) .. I'm thinking something has got to give .. at 1pm tomorrow .. I am running and not looking back ! 
< PROPFIRST > ism 101- went to store to buy pants .. saw a cute ruffly top .. of pretty white , pinks and orange colors .. I picked it up and < PROPFIRST > said .. \Oh no mommy .. you'd look like a CHICKEN !! \ " .. the lady standing next to me said .. \ " so .. I guess you aren't buying that top huh ? \ " .. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >..." 
In an attempt to regain usage of his legos , < PROPFIRST > has put a note on his bedroom door that says \don't come in\ " .. ( he asked me how to spell it ) . He just came out to inform me that he is cleaning his room . He lost his legos because he was a MONSTER in the fishie store .. He just notified me that it was \ " hard work to do that\ " .. and that I am now allowed to come see . What a scheister ! " 
off to visit < PROPFEMALE > today in NJ .. I really wish that darn immunization training didn't keep me up so late .. My copilots will just have to keep me awake ! 
great day with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > .. NJ to visit < PROPFEMALE > .. dinner at Cooper's in Scranton .. ice cream at Manning's .. now ... time for bed .. and time to detox from food overload ! Hey .. it was Almond Joy in a pretzel cone .. it was worth feeling ill !! 
damn .. the Earleasaurus is at it full blast .. SNORK ! KKKK !! SNORK WHOOSH !! 2 hrs sleep in like 2 days .. doubt he used his nasal steroids because he is too tired to even know his name .. off to the extra bed in < PROPFIRST>'s room for me .. Oooo .. how a love a twin bed .. let me count the ways .. SNORK SNORK SNORK !!! I can't even smack him .. poor thing .. darn overnights .. 
My friend < PROPFEMALE > is my new hero .. for those of you that never has the balls to say what you really mean .. < PROPFEMALE > .. we applaud you .. this happened at her local grocery store .. See below .. in comments .. I think I owe her a present for this one .. 
off to Albany for immunization and cpr classes .. blah blah blah .. back tomorrow .. do I reeeeeally have to go ? :( .. at least < PROPFEMALE > my hero is going too ;) 
Driving back from albany ... stopped at < PROPMALE > BBQ .. bringing dinner home . \ 
YUM ! 
thank goodness .. finally home sweet home .. 
Every morning I am subjected to seeing this man in slippers and a white < PROPFIRST > robe putting his child on the bus . Ewwwww ! Pants ever hear of them ? 
Nitey nite all .. I have a sneaking suspicion that tomorrow is not going to be pretty .. thou shall push forward though ! 
After speaking to my hero .. I am going to get some ice cream with the boys to try to forget about today .. then maybe watch that movie I've been meaning to for the last few weeks .. 
Man .. what is up with the wind today ?? Two hands on the wheel if you are drivin ' round the southern tier tonight ! 
Mr. < PROPFEMALE > is making a guest appearance as my profile pic .. big fluffy macaw face !! And yes .. he is a Mr. 
off to bed .. working mommy's day tomorrow .. I really wish I had a mon-fri job ... nitey nite facebook friends .. 
Happy Mother's Day all you mommies out there !.. and hey .. what the heck is up with the SNOW on my car this morning !! 
home from work at last .. spending time with the boys .. and dog .. and flock .. everyone needs a little love today :) 
Earleasaurus is snorking ... so I thought I would watch some tv .. does anyone else go endlessly through the channels for over an hour rather that look at the guide channel for 5 minutes to see what is on because you think it will \take too long\ " ? I think I almost gave myself a seizure from flipping so fast :) " 
day off .. finished my post test for immunization training .. bleh .. Now I'm thinking I will chillax before taking on the bird room .. I honestly don't feel like doing anything . I wish it was warmer out .. darn freeze killed my irises .. I shall go muster up some ambition .. it's hard when the dog and all the birds are napping .. 
off to work for 11 hrs today .. bleh :( 
winding down from a long day at work .. must think happy thoughts .. I hate coming home late from work and not being able to see my little man :( wait .. that wasn't happy ... umm .. guess I'll go spend some time with my bigger man before he starts snorking ;) 
isn't it aggravating when you go to cook your chicken you bought 2 days ago .. that says it is good for 4 more days .. and it is ROTTEN !!.. I've had this happen before and never brought it back .. oh wait .. there was that time I was sold a $40 rotten ham .. that went back .. < PROPMALE > is being a good hubby and bringing it back in exchange for an edible chicken .. I think I shall make him tasty dessert as a reward :) 
workin 11-9 then < PROPFEMALE > all weekend .. at least it is crappy outside .. I'd be sad if it was < PROPFEMALE > .. 
5 guys burgers and fries :) 
snork snork .. whack whack ... :( 
Ellll < PROPFEMALE > ... a do wop a mow wow .. el < PROPFEMALE > .. 
after having < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > for a few months .. we finally assembled a cage for < PROPFEMALE > ( the GW Macaw ) to sleep in .. toys are < PROPMALE > .. giant perches galore .. and I can't help but think to myself , that he looks quite ridiculous in there .. I think he was meant to just < PROPFEMALE > out side a cage and destroy my java perches .. 
off to bed .. all this cage building and < PROPFEMALE > room cleaning has us pooped :) 
day 7 .. I can do this .. unwillingly .. but I can do this .. 
Seriously .. dead < PROPFIRST > in the road ( makes me sad ) then slam on brakes to avoid hitting squirrel with his breakfast .. round the corner to see bathrobe man ... 
Why o why .. when you don't get a good nights sleep .. and it is day 8 of work ... does my one macaw ( < PROPMALE > ) think it is a good idea to yell like crazy at 6am ?.. just sayin .. Now I know why < PROPFEMALE > tells him to \shut up\ " . My goodness .. " 
I'm free !! I'm free !! 
Cool !! The google homepage is a pac man game you can actually play ! 
Fantastic .. my one macaw almost flies away today due to um .. stupidity by a certain boy named < PROPMALE > ... and then my one re-homed macaw .. is re-kindling some profane vocab from his past owner .. today it was .. \Bad bird ! You're a bad bird !! you little fu**er !! \ " Shut up !! SHUT ... UP !! Good god .. I really do live in an insane asylum .. " 
procrastinating on Facebook is so much better than getting ready for work .. on a Monday .. or well .. any day .. 
12 hr day .. bad headache since 3am .. I'm looking for divine intervention here ... 
a day off tomorrow .. at least for now .. guess I should start lighting candles .. 
Sometimes I look back .. and wonder where the time went .. 
Bathrobe man .. damn ... 
ahhhh .. a night with the family .. :) this makes me happy .. wish it wasn't like 90 degrees out .. oh darn .. guess the lawn will have to wait ! 
seriously .. < PROPFIRST > won .. nice guy but seriously ?? what ?? I guess it's ok though .. maybe < PROPFEMALE>'s cd will come out quicker .. her original music is amazing .. I can't wait .. I hate going to bed annoyed .. 
Ithaca here I come .. it's been a while .. I need to practice my .. \no .. you can't have your soma 20 days early .. no .. you can't have your oxy-co-co\ " speech ! " 
Is loving ithaca ... oh what the hell am I thinking . Someone please get me out of here !!! 
Everybody think positive for my niece Ally ... she is in the hospital in < PROPFEMALE > with pneumonia and a uti .. poor little pumpkin .. hopefully she'll feel well enough to come home tomorrow ( she is in the pic with < PROPFIRST > ) :( 
drivin ' to < PROPFEMALE > for work .. bleh .. 
Oh busy day in pharmacy land ... hopefully everyone will chill out for work this weekend ... 
off to bed Facebook friends .. working all weekend in Vestal .. throw me a piece of < PROPFEMALE > if you walk by :) 
One more day .. then a day off . Time to go cuddle with a cockatoo .. 
finally a day off .. Family trip out to NJ to get < PROPFEMALE > ! :) 
lower fat ice cream + magic shell = one big fat mess . Lesson learned .. if you are going to be a pig and have ice cream with magic shell , just get the full fat ice cream , or your low fat crap will deflate under the \not so magic anymore shell\ " :( " 
I guess I'll start weeding the garden tomorrow .. plant some non-pesticide yummies for the fam and flock .. 
< PROPFEMALE > is adjusting really well . His sweet little noises are too adorable . He is kinda like a little toy .. and when you pet it .. you never know what sound effects you are going to get .. so cute ! 
time to tuck the little man in .. the big man is already snorin ... 
Oh good god .. < PROPFEMALE > is unleashing profanity .. and it is only 730 in the morning .. excuse me .. but I need to go distract < PROPFIRST > so he doesn't hear him ... 
Seriously .. I can't even go to the plant shop without seeing some guy's crack sticking out of his pants .. good god .. get a belt ! 
Weeds dug .. petunias planted . mulch ... I think I need a breather before I tackle the garden .. hmmm ... maybe I can con the boys into helping me later .. ;) 
Stage II , weeding the garden .. so we can plant proved to be a very daunting task .. it has been overtaken by mutant daisys .. day 2 of digging tomorrow .. ibuprofen tonight .. Garden < PROPFEMALE > .. please come see my garden tonight and have it tilled for the morning .. thanks .. Mrs. Reome :) 
Come on .. don't ya just want to smootch that big < PROPFEMALE > beak ? This is Mr. < PROPFEMALE > .. making another appearance .. and for all of you that follow my < PROPFEMALE > drama .. this is the potty mouth ( and no .. he didn't learn it from us .. he was re-homed ) 
I think I almost threw up .. the cnn.com homepage has poor birdies completely covered in oil , gasping for air .. I had to close it .. it infuriated me . Damn you BP . 
In carwash ... it smells like wintergreen .. am I still sleeping ?.. this is odd .. I feel like I'm in a < PROPMALE > wonka movie 
Day 2 of digging in garden .. still lots to do .. On a happier note .. found some celery plants FINALLY to plant minus the 69 pesticides .. Home grown so much better than store bought .. Yippe ! Hopefully we'll get all this stuff in the ground tomorrow :) 
good night facebook friends .. 
nothing like reading the sunday paper and being under a tornado watch ... 
Tornado warning now .. wtf ? 
profile pic guest appearance by Nishi .. < PROPFEMALE>'s African Grey .. think < PROPFEMALE > .. but 20 years older .. she is one of < PROPFEMALE>'s rescues . She has the best facial expressions .. :) 
lacking motivation .. I think I will get my butt outside and go mow that lawn ...

Landscaping fixed up , weeds plucked from side of house .. < PROPFEMALE > daisies , black eyed susans , and lavender planted .. irises relocated .. this time I'm going to be smart .. and put down the darn landscaping fabric around the flowers .. no more of this weed crap ! 
< PROPFIRST > just informed me that his \girlfriend\ " is in 5th grade ( he is 5 ) .. and showed me her pic in his yearbook .. does that make her a cougar ?.. :) " 
lunch with Shell , retail therapy at outlets , time to put the little man to sleep .. 
I'm so mad .. got in car accident after guy in front of me goes to pull out , then stops , and I hit him .. now my insurance will go up .. grrrrrr ! 
Zoo .. now toy story 3 with < PROPFIRST > :) 
ok peeps .. Toy Story 3 in 3D , definitely a must see esp . if you have little ones . Heck , I think the adults were laughing just as hard . A good time :) 
contimplating whipping out the power saw and makin ' some bird toys .. guess I'm off to Lowe's for some 2x4s ... :) 
bustin ' out the power tools ... 
Wooo hooo !! < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > tonight with Shell .. :) 
Who would have thought that the diners in this darn town are closed at midnight .. but applebees is open ... 
great time tonight with friends and fam at concert .. can't remember the last time I was up this late on purpose .. man .. I'm getting old ... 
< PROPFIRST > is dancing and singing Glee songs to the birds in his underpants .. He likes to pretend they are his \students\ " also .. and teaches them .. and makes them < PROPFEMALE > toys .. I think I need to hide the zip ties .. " 
Seriously .. the Monday after the holiday .. a 13 hr shift .. and a gas leak at my store and I've been evacuated .. seriously .. good grief .. 
off to work .. supposed to be my day off .. bleh ... I really need to learn to \just say no \"" 
13 hr day :( Suppose I should get movin'! 
Dear work gods , please be kind to me today .. another 12 hr shift .. then off tomorrow . And you tell those bosses of mine not to bother calling me , cause I am NOT working tomorrow .. thats right .. I SAID NOOOOO !!! My family and flock need love ... :) 
Finally .. a day off .. Said goodbye to < PROPMALE > this morn .. crawled back into bed .. then < PROPFIRST > dragged me back out .. is there no justice ?.. We must do something fun today .. anyone see Despicable Me yet ?... feedback ? 
was all sorts of crazy and worked an overnight last night .. now my head won't stop bobbing back and forth .. those ding bats better get me out of tomorrow .. but you KNOW that is not going to happen .. on a happier note .. < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and Ally are coming to visit and for this I am grateful :) 
hey bird folk with macaws .. nutsonline.com has a good savings on bulk mixed nuts . I ordered 50lbs shelled .. after shipping only is about 3lb/lb after 1 day shipping . Not too shabby ! And they get rav reviews . If you want some , send me your email address and I'll refer you to get 10% off :) Throw some cinnamon , pistachios and nutmeg and voila- super cheap Goldenfeast Patagonian Spice and Nut mix ! Save over $3/lb ! 
480 < PROPMALE > .. one rental truck , one 5 year old , one stainless cage and a monster java perch , this girl is toast . Two 12 hr days Mon & Tues .. god I wish I was home earlier .. At least my java jungle is almost complete ! It's always great to be home :) 
pharmacist job hazard 1 ) tripping over your technician as you fly in one direction , and she backs up not seeing you fly by .. then spraining your ankle , and hurting your lower back .. then having to stand on it for the next 11 hours . I'd be lying if I said I didn't shove an icepack down the back of my pants ... 
I enjoy the bits of insanity in my life .. < PROPFIRST > was just downstairs , standing on a step stool in his underpants .. singing songs in a microphone to the birds .. at least everyone plays a role in entertaining them ... 
Since when is doing like 450 prescriptions by yourself with no overlap acceptable ?.. That's right .. its not .. On a happier note , I am off tomorrow with my fam . It has been wayyyy too long .. 
Happiness : enjoying watching the little sparrows hop around and tweet on wegmans outdoor patio with < PROPFIRST > :) 
outlets with < PROPFIRST > .. coupons in hand .. here we come ! 
Rt 380 wtf ??? Detouring around the poconos in eternal traffic :( 
finally home after rt 380 in < PROPFEMALE > being completely shut down , accident on 81-detour , then accident on 26s in Vestal .. about 3 hrs extra driving on top of my 4 hr round trip to the outlets . Did you ever have one of those days where you just should have stayed home ? 
Am I on candid camera ?... Work just called a bit ago and said I don't have to go in today ! I think we are off to Claws and Paws for some family fun . Was all dressed and ready to go too .. This is like your alarm going off .. then realizing you can crawl back under the covers and sleep some more .. SPECTACULAR ! :) :) :) 
Diner .. back 2 school shopping .. house cleaning .. < PROPFEMALE > cage construction .. gonna be a busy day .. 
nice weekend with the fam .. now trying to psych myself up for back to back 14 hrs shifts on a Mon and Tues .. needless to say .. I'll see you all on Wednesday .. bleh .. 
Feet were not meant to be stood on for 14 hrs straight .. 2 days in a row .. I think they are going to burst into flames .. they hurt sooo much . Thank god no work tomorrow .. ok .. i'm done whining .. 
< PROPFIRST > -isms in the last 24 hours : #1 me : \ < PROPFIRST > did you just fart under the covers\ " .. < PROPFIRST > - \ " yes mommy .. I'm sorry .. I have a lot of garbage in my butt\ " . \ 
< PROPFIRST > ism 101 : Scenario : I am running bath .. < PROPFIRST > runs in the bathroom and states with much exuberance .. \I'm in my bathing suit !!!! \ " .. Reality .. he is < PROPMALE > naked . I do believe he is getting even more witty in his 5 yrs of age ... " 
just got out of work .. and I am not answering my phone tomorrow .. :) 
poll : what do you currently do for a living .. and what is your dream job ? ( assuming money wasn't an issue ) .. it's been a topic of discussion lately . I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up :) 
making piggies in the blanket for us .. making \chop\ " for the birdies .. this kitchen is going to be a wreck after all of this ! " 
Halupki rolled .. in oven .. < PROPFEMALE > chop is \chopped\ " .. woo hooo ! " 
ahhh .. at last ... off for 2 days .. it's weird when your Wednesday is your \Friday\ " .. but hey .. 2 days off .. in a row .. I'll take it ! " 
Jumping Jungle at noon with < PROPFIRST > and his friend , then lunch with Miss < PROPFEMALE > .. ahhhh ,... it's nice to not be at work ! 
just heard some\birdie\ " crunch the wall .. then I heard < PROPFEMALE > ( GW macaw ) go \ " UUUUUGGGHHH OOOHH ! \ " Guess I should get down there ... " 
Flashes of red , and yellow .. green and blue .. then those sporadic piles of poo .. yup .. cleaning the bird room ... 
Cooper's for dinner .. I'm pretty sure my stomach is gonna explode ... bayou shrimp .. softshells .. oh my .. 
12 hr shift done .. 1/2 day tomorrow .. gee .. tomorrow will be a breeze after today ... oh yeah .. did I mention the 62 yr old lady on psych meds that told us she was preggo today .. meeting with her doc on Monday .. please lord .. tell me it is all just her imagination .. 
Miss < PROPFEMALE > was having fun hanging out with the neighbors .. I'm so happy she is a super social < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Claws and paws 
Back from Claws n Paws with the kids . < PROPFIRST > loved the birdies and wouldn't pay attention to the other animals . Now .. to tackle the kitchen .. < PROPMALE > starts 7 straight of overnights tonight .. boooo ... 
Friends/Family , please send me a message on her or a text to my phone , so I can have your < PROPFIRST > ... I lost all my contacts .. grrrrr ... 
Philadelphia Zoo for my birthday with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ... I can use some quality time with friends and fam .. too bad < PROPMALE > is on overnights :( At least I bought a year pass so we can take him soon too ! 
Ah shucks , thanks everyone for the birthday wishes ! You are all the best !! 
tried to put < PROPFEMALE > down .. < PROPFEMALE > tried to take a chunk out of my back , spun and smacked my knee off java perch with brute force .. net result .. looks like someone took a hammer to my knee .. and had to get the crutches out . SO .. it that how we are going to start the day ??... 
Happy 6th Birthday to my < PROPFIRST > pie !.. 1st day back to school tomorrow .. getting him all clean in the tub . < PROPMALE > is trying to find all the school supplies < PROPFIRST > strategically placed around the house .. :) 
Does anyone else find it somewhat alarming , that as natural born American citizens , < PROPMALE > and I have to take an ENGLISH proficiency exam in order to get licensed in another state .. Oh yeah .. and that we have to drive to Philadelphia or Rochester to take it ?.. Sigh ... 
Cute little fluffy chickadees and sparrows make me smile :) 
13 hr day .. 2 stores .. and < PROPFIRST > didn't sleep well ( therefore I didn't ) .. and it's a Monday . Umm ... can I just go hide under the covers now ?? 
finally done with 2 very long not nice days at work ... off to Philly tomorrow to prove my English speaking abilities .. woo hoo ! 
Back from Philly .. for those of you that had any doubts .. YES I can speak English . We hit up < PROPFIRST>'s Steaks for some cheesesteaks , the hit Maroni's on our way back through Scranton .. I think I'm going to go eat an apple and detox :) 
< PROPMALE > is being a good boy and mowing the lawn ... suppose that means I should be a good wife and get downstairs and start making a crock o ' sauce .. 
I think my 2 big blue birds are planning a master scheme .. they are spending a lot of time together .. and all I can hear is < PROPFEMALE > laughing ... 
NCIS and Glee .. wooo hoooo !!! 
Boooooooo ... work till 10pm .... 
Feeling optimistic :) 
Boys are out of town .. mamma gets to stay home and work .. gee .. if that doesn't stink .. well .. on the bright side .. there won't be any snoring keeping me awake tonight :) At least there are a lot of critters to keep me company .. 
ahhhh .. thank goodness family will be home in a couple hours .. god I miss them ... 
chicky in the oven .. veggies on the stove .. birdies happily munching away on broccoli and cauliflower . I love watching them eat broccoli ... it's like they are eating little trees ... 
did you ever have the feeling that it was just going to be .. \one of those days \"...?" 
well .. I think after this exhausting day .. I need to go grab a cockatoo and snuggle .. 
hey kids , my phone died .. again .. darn droid .. Anyway .. call < PROPMALE > if you need to get me . New phone by fri/sat .. how annoying .. 
don't forget your umbrellas today .. it's gonna be a soaker !! 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and Ally arrived safely with birdies in tow .. now we are one big happy family and flock ! :) 
Watch out Ithacans .. I'm coming back up there for a day tomorrow ... keep your narcs away from me .. just take the up the hill to see my friends in red and khaki ;) 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > .. prying my fist open to get to the bandaid on my wounded finger .. is not my idea of foraging fun ... 
I like it on the stairs .. on the floor .. on the table .. just about anywhere .. I'm spontaneous like that ;) 
Boy scout registration , uniform , patches for < PROPFIRST > $90 . Needles and thread to sew on the patches about $8 . Realizing you spent the last hour sewing on a patch crooked .. but your little boy still thinks you are his hero .. PRICELESS :) 
I think I should just break down and buy a sewing machine ... 
ironic : spontaneous road trip to Scranton , visit to Grandma < PROPFEMALE>'s house .. driving back up to NY .. stop at rest stop .. come out of rest stop .. and < PROPMALE>'s mom and step dad are there talking to < PROPMALE > .. They were driving back from North < PROPFEMALE > , en route to Syracuse .. and we somehow ended up at the same place .. same time .. Crazy .. things that make you go hmmmmmmmmmmm .... 
Dear Mr. Mosquito .. the next time you try to bite me at 6am in the shower .. on a Monday .. in October .. Remember .. YOU are no match for me and my towel twapping skills ! Anyone want some mosquito on their toast this morning ? ;) 
I really wish < PROPFIRST > would stop stuffing flashlights , and his fake screwdrivers down his underpants .. he thinks it is like his tool belt .. gheesh .... I think he had a hammer in his crack .. 
People like to complain .. and we all do our fair share .. but I challenge you all to think of something that makes you smile . Stop and appreciate the little things . Many things make me smile . Every time I drive around NY , < PROPFEMALE > , I truly adore the deer crossing signs with the little red noses like < PROPMALE > .. they are so cute ! 
off to Scranton to the pumpkin patch with Aunt Shell and < PROPMALE > .. this should be quite comical ... 
although I am quite \anti-commercialization\ " of the pumpkin patch $9.95 admission for each of us .. I am happy < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > had a good time . That makes it worth it .. and I got to get a lot of nice pics :) " 
do I .. a ) deal with the Earle-a-saurus snoring and stay in our bed b ) crawl into < PROPFIRST>'s bed .. or c ) abandon the both and see a refuge of silence in the spare bedroom ... ah .. the difficult choices we face in life ... ;) 
at last .. a day off tomorrow . Road trip with the fam to NJ to Parrot Palooza and it is supposed to be 68 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > .. should be a great day :) 
< PROPFIRST > isms 101 : I call home when I get out of work .. and < PROPFIRST > picks up the phone .. I say hi , have some chit chat , and ask to speak to Daddy .. he says .. \wait Mommy .. now tell me about your day .. \ " god he makes me laugh .. " 
Halloween costumes purchased .. now lets hope they get here in time . Watch out neighbors .. the Reome's are sportin ' some ghost < PROPMALE > gear . Just be thankful that < PROPFIRST > didn't get his way . He picked out the slutty ghost < PROPMALE > costume for his mommy .. good god .. I told him .. I'll just be the ghost .. lol .. 
my big blue < PROPFEMALE > macaw < PROPFEMALE > .. just flew across the one bird room .. into the other at me because she wanted scratchies too .. To put that into perspective for those of you that can't picture it .. Imagine a blue 747 aiming for your head .. Everybirdie wants love .. 
my piece of poop Droid is well .. a piece of poop .. so if u call me .. you won't be able to make out a word I am saying . Soooo .. text me if u need me until I get ... yet .. another phone .. uuuughhhh !! 
um ... please make the snow stop .. it's Halloween .. and that is not cool .. 
Did you ever wonder .. how in the summer it can be 70 degrees in your house and you are warm .. and in the fall .. it is 72 degrees and you are freezing ??.. like seriously .. my hands are like ice cubes ! I think I better get some humidifiers going in here .. 
Dinosaur bbq ... ooo la la ! 
man NCIS and Glee tonight .. which to watch .. which to record .. ahhhh tough choices ! 
if anyone sees that video clip about a bad accident and text messaging don't open it .. my sis did not post in on her profile .. but it showed up in my news feed as if she did .. grrrr ... 
Did you ever have one of those days ... where you have tons to do .. but just don't feel like it ?.. Yup .. it's one of those . I need to muster up some ambition .. and get crackin'! 
< PROPFIRST > comes upstairs .. \mommy .. < PROPFEMALE > ( the big blue Hy ) is on the ground\ " .. ok .. and .. \ " well ... Daddy is scared .. you better come down .. \ " .. LOL !! " 
sooooo ... < PROPFIRST > just covered himself ( in his underpants of course ) all over with mini multi colored post it notes .. and stuck a piece of cardboard out the back of said underpants .. and is squaking and pretending to be a bird .. ummm .. I think it might be time for an intervention ... 
just had some awful Mexican food after our fav place was packed ... what a bummer .. < PROPMALE > said it was all my fault for making him a food snob .. nice .. But like seriously .. who the heck makes a seafood burrito with imitation crab .. and doesn't disclose such nonsense in the menu .. Oh yeah .. that's right .. a place we'll never go back to .. better luck next fiesta .. :) 
Beautiful < PROPFEMALE > tonight ... 
After the mexican disaster last night .. < PROPMALE > wanted to go to Scranton to Coopers .. he looked at the menu and said \see .. no imitation crab here ! LOL !!! " 
you know how people say they have a headache .. and it feels like there is a < PROPFIRST > hammer in their head .. Well ... I literally had a < PROPFIRST > hammer and a saw going at it for 2 and a half hours .. 15 feet from my pharmacy today at the end of my 12 hr shift .. I think it's safe to say .. I'm glad to be home .. 
Trying to keep a 6 year old boy and a flock of birds quiet while your husband is sleeping because he is on overnights is like trying to keep an ice cube frozen on the face of the sun ... it just can't happen ... 
Happy Thanksgiving to all my wonderful family and friends ! < PROPMALE > is sleeping , and < PROPFIRST > and I are in charge of dinner . I think I have time to whip out a few extra pumpkin pies before he wakes up later :) Have a wonderful day everyone ! 
< PROPFIRST > just told me that $50 is not a lot for a Lots-O-Huggin bear ( you know .. the one from Toy Story 3 .. ) .. he said $100 is bad .. $50 is not .. I asked him if he had $50 to pay for it .. and he said ... NO .. DO YOU ?? I think this child needs to learn the value of a dollar .. and quick .. 
hey friends .. I usually order Honeybell tangelos every January .. and everyone loves them .. < PROPMALE>'s Groves ( online ) has them with free shipping ( on up to 3 boxes you order ) if you spend over $50 until 12/14 , AND you get a box of free mini honeybells in January .. so .. order some .. and stop eating mine !! LOL !! It's good eats and good for you ! 
... and then the rains came 
hmmm .... when 2 of your birds ( < PROPFEMALE > ( YNZ ) and < PROPFEMALE > ( CAG )) can mimic your asthmatic wheezie cough perfectly .. maybe it is time to go back on the inhalers .. 
< PROPFIRST > isms 101 : I see < PROPFIRST > peeling all the paper off of a flesh toned crayon so I ask him what his is doing that for . His reply .. \I'm making it naked mommy\ " .. all righty then .. " 
off for a family haircut .. this should be interesting ... 
most schools in the southern tier are on a 2 hour delay today .. check the news .. 
so when shopping for new home owners insurance .. the lady said you have birds .. and he says yes .. and then she asked their weights/height/species , etc ... seriously .. are you kidding ? Yes .. I can understand asking how many , but seriously .. he had to sit there and go .. well .. this one is probably half a pound and 7 in tall ... and that one .. SERIOUSLY ... are you kidding me ? 
Ok .. monster lobster chillin ' in the frige .. ribeyes on standby .. crab bisque cooked .. cake is waiting .. now all we need is the birthday boy .. 
fantastic .. the family is feeling guilty about killing the lobster .. now I get to be the bad guy .. 
For years I tried to get < PROPMALE > to go for a sleep study and he wouldn't even though his Dr. wanted him to . Finally .. someone else makes him an appt . and he got his results tonight . The ding bat stops breathing 25 times AN HOUR . Nice job < PROPMALE > .. I always enjoy a good \I told you so\ " :) Now .. let's get this boy fixed up ! " 
Oh dear .. my little man < PROPFIRST > has a 103 fever .. this is not a good way to start the week . You know when your little man who is usually warm running around in his underpants is shivering cold .. something is wrong . Poor little guy .. 
hey anyone commuting to NY from < PROPFEMALE > this morning .. 81 North is closed near the border .. tractor trailer accident .. take route 11 !! 
The flock is all happily munching on sweet potatoes and I suppose it is time to make the humans some food too .. 
just another typical evening in the Reome household ... < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > ( Hy macaw ) and < PROPFEMALE > ( B&G macaw ) chasing each other around the center island . Gee .. I wonder who is going to catch who first .. 
Dear bronchitis .. I am not in the mood for your crap today .. I do not like the feeling of drowning in my own lungs , and I think you are really mean for coming at Christmas time . I love how you get really bad when I am working back to back 12 hr days and can't go to the doctor . Bahhh Humbug . 
Bark bark .. gurgle gurgle .. thank goodness I made it to the doctor yesterday . Now , errands to run , boyscout patches to sew , a tree to finish , and hopefully some rest in there somewhere . I still can't believe it is December let alone a week ' till Christmas . Yikes .. Really wish < PROPFEMALE > would bring me my lungs already .. 
My father just had a massive heart attack this evening . I just found out . Not looking really good right now . He is back in surgery . Trying to think positive but I'm really worried .. 
My dad finally made it out of the ICU and onto a telemetry floor . Hoping for a discharge later this week . Honestly .. I just want this awful week to be over .. brief synopsis .. me- bronchitis , dad- heart attack , Jenny/Ally puking , Us afraid we will puke or make Dad puke , Mom MRI on brain , Mom's dog dying ( getting put to sleep tomorrow ) . Sorry friends and fam , Christmas cards aren't happening this year .. 
Dad was finally discharged today thank goodness . I'm holding him hostage at my house for awhile . Trying to convince someone with a strong personality that they are not invincible isn't always easy . Getting over the denial that one is not invincible isn't easy either . Baby steps .. 
lego building , kitchen cleaning , turkey cooking , dad is sleeping .. its a low key Christmas for the first time in my house .. and for the first time , I'm fine with that . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all my friends and family , and thanks to all of you that have been so wonderful during this challenging time . It really means a lot to me :) 
at last .. a day off tomorrow . Bringing Dad to Scranton for blood work , then hopefully a relaxing evening at home . Everybody and every < PROPFEMALE > needs some love . 
< PROPMALE > crab legs check .. shrimp check .. lobster check .. some turf for with the surf .. check .. wine .. check ... Now , if only my family will show up .. 
Fab 12 hr day .. 2 techs called out .. on a Monday .. after the holiday weekend ... when everyone has new insurance .. and my bronchitis is back even worse . I think I'm gonna go crawl under a rock now .. 
booooo ... trying to sleep .. and I can't stop barking .. then add in the fact that my cockatoo likes to make this funny noise every time I bark .. I think it's gonna be a looooong nite .. 
I don't wanna go to work .. bleeech .. suppose I should go have some cheese with my whine .. 
finally turned those funky bananas into chocolate chip banana bread . Now I can go sleep in peace :) 
my < PROPFEMALE > Macaw < PROPFEMALE > is apparently afraid of her shadow . She is screaming like a pterodactyl that had testosterone injections .. It is a weee bit LOUD in my house right now ... RAAARARRRR !! RAARRRR !!! HOOOOONKKKK !!! RAAAAARRRR !!! 
cockatoo get OFF my keyboard !!! 
Pinewood Derby ! Goooooo < PROPFIRST > ! 
came home from work to find my sassy < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > being all sweet and cuddly .. that makes me happy :) 
it is seriously -9 outside .. and that is not wind chill .. not cool ... 
< PROPFIRST > isms 101 : Glee is on and < PROPFIRST > is standing on the bed dancing like crazy ( to \I think I wanna marry you\ " . I tell him to sit down on his butt and dance so he doesn't get hurt . He stands up and yells .. \ " MOMMY I CAN FEEL THE BEAT !! I CAN'T SIT DOWN AND DANCE !!! \ " as he stands back up and starts dancing and singing .. crazy boy .. " 
Second 12hr day in a row .. tired .. head bobbling on way to work . What comes on the radio ? \She works hard for the money\ " .. lol .. how could I not laugh ... " 
NY to MD to DE to < PROPFEMALE > to NY .. in 2 days .. whew .. I'm pooped . Now we have some new parrotlet friends to play with ! :) 
how did I miss that < PROPFEMALE > Bowersox came out with her album in December ? I hope she does an acoustic album too .. that would be awesome .. 
well .. I guess sitting procrastinating on facebook isn't going to scrape the ice off my car .. any volunteers to go be a pharmacist today ? :) 
Drove back from Scranton .. now sitting on the side of rt 26 while < PROPMALE > jacks the car up .. this is just spectacular ... 
stocked my spice cabinet with a plethera of indian spices today . Went a little wild at Wegmans . Day 1 of Indian food .. delish ! Never knew chick peas could be that filling .. < PROPFIRST > my little < PROPFIRST > Flay went over grabbed some cilantro and decorated his chicken . Apparaently presentation counts when you are 6 .. 
I'm cold .. I'm going to bed to find someone sleeping that's warm ... :) 
ok .. had my cell when I got home last night at 930 now .. its in a black hole somewhere .. I call it an get voicemail . Why does this crap happen when you are leaving town .. . uuuuugggghhhh ... 
< PROPMALE > found my cell phone , it was apparently under my ass in the car .. 
Workin 12 hrs today .. having a romantic cup of oatmeal in McDonald's parking lot .. thou shall post pone V day till tomorrow :) 
hellloooo Shamrock Shake .. 
My little < PROPFIRST > pie just showed me a book he made on fishing . It includes step my step pictures on how to catch fish , deboning them and cooking them . Just another example of how our babies never cease to amaze us . I suppose I have to take him fishing now ... 
adventures of the flock : I just sitting on my couch and I hear the tippy tappy of feet in the kitchen . It was < PROPFEMALE > ( big blue bird in my pic ) . She walked from the bird room , through the kitchen , then FLEW up on my shoulder ( from the floor ) and grabbed my spoon that was in my mouth ( eating my cereal) ! Crazy bird !! Guess she wanted some .. 
my yellow naped amazon < PROPFIRST > keeps singing \who let the birds out .. whooo who who who .. who let the birds out .. \ " It sounds like a crazy asylum in here .. " 
My < PROPFEMALE > Macaw snapped 2 welds on her stainless steel cage . Is that how today is going to start ? 
ah freedom at last ! A little stay-cation .. Next up , creating a cake to auction off for < PROPFIRST>'s boyscout dinner tomorrow . Hmmm ... how creative can I get with buttercream ? Wish I had more time to play with fondant .. This workin ' back to back 12 hr shifts put a damper on my masterpiece .. grrrr ... 
Noooo bronchitis noooooo ! 
Adamism : he just figured out how to photocopy money on the printer . I don't have the heart to tell him it isn't real yet . His happy dance is quite entertaining .. 
Got the bag o ' bronchitis meds again . I think it is safe to say that my birds will never stop imitating my bark . Gee and to think I had such aspirations for my week off from work . I guess it is better than being at work with the plague though .. I guess things are looking up .. 
well hello there fresh cilantro .. I think I shall turn you into some tasty Indian food ! 
oh no .. Now < PROPFIRST > has a fever .. geesh ... 
feeling somewhat defeated today .. Had to start the prednisone for my plague .. apparently I was out of my mind thinking inhaled steroids would help . They are pretty sure < PROPFIRST > has pneumonia .. and he HATES taking medicine so it's a battle . I didn't get anything accomplished on my week off due to the above . Guess I'm just grumpy .. forgive me .. :( 
hmm .. 4:30 am , workin ' in the morning .. can't stop barkin . I'm hunkered down in the office with the door closed and the dog snoring because my cockatoo screeches when cough . I feel like I'm in some wacko movie .. and I'm the main character .. 
So , I hear it pouring rain outside .. check the weather .. and the area is in a flood watch and winter storm warning ? When did that happen . Gotta love the Northeast . Couple inches of rain to melt all the snow , make it flood , then dump a bunch more snow on the ground . Guess my little < PROPFEMALE > and daffodils that have been trying to come up are getting buried again .. booooo 
you know there is a lot of snow out there when you can't see your < PROPFEMALE > retriever anymore .. 
so .. official reports in for Vestal .. 21.5 inches of snow . I guess I wasn't crazy ;) 
In honor of MS awareness week , March 7th-13th , 2011 , I am asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you love has Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . I know my friends will . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just for one hour . Do it in the memory and the honor of those fighting MS ... 
So beating the husband didn't get him to stop snoring .. I went and found a girl scout cookie .. and a set of ear plugs so I can try this sleep thing again .. 
Sometimes we get little reminders as to why we should be grateful for everything and everyone we have in our lives . Seeing the news of that earthquake is like a great big slap in the face . I hope that everyone's loved ones are safe . It is such a hard thing to wrap your mind around . Never forget to tell your loved ones that you do love them , because you truely never know what tomorrow brings ... 
What ? What is that big glowing ball up in the sky today in Binghamton , NY .. OH MY GOODNESS ! It's the SUN !!! Yes folks .. it is a reason to get excited .. I didn't even care my window was frosted over this morning .. it was < PROPFEMALE > . Sad that this is a rarity around here .. 
I love first thing in the morning , when my Yellow Naped Amazon < PROPFIRST > sits in his cage and whispers . I hear most of his vocabulary usually .. and my fav part is when he does an eclectic blend of a couple songs he almost knows . Of course I can't go down there or he will stop .. so .. I'll just sit her and listen a little while longer to the cuteness ... Smiles before work are a good thing :) 
omg .. I just got kicked in the eyeball by my Hy Macaw < PROPFEMALE > .. maybe if I blink enough times it will be ok . I reeeealy don't feel like going to the eye doctor .. good grief .. can you hear that conversation now .. \um well .. you see .. she is a really big bird .. with a really big foot .. and really long nails ... \"" 
Bringing < PROPFEMALE > over to Parrot Safari for a trim and visit .. I love visiting all the feathered friends :) 
Sitting at Sonic eating bad food singing and dancing to the Glee soundtrack with < PROPFIRST > .. next stop movie theater to see Hop :) 
There are lots of things that make me smile . Today it was my little crocus , the pretty white birch trees I saw on a drive .. my son < PROPFIRST > making my whole side of the Mexican restaurant laugh .. Seeing one of my hysterical old patients with her great British accent as I was leaving work , and knowing I don't have to be at work the next 2 days . Ahhhh .. :)

At last .. 3 day weekend no school for < PROPFIRST > means we get to sleep in for once ! It's been weeks since I've had a home cooked meal at home with my family . As I was driving home from work tonight , < PROPFIRST > told me has has an extra special Easter snuggle for me . Guess I'm one luck mom . :) 
So < PROPFIRST > lets me sleep in a whole 15 minutes today . I hear \Mommy ! Wake up !! It's Earth Day !! \ " Me .. \ " mumble mumble .. I'm tired < PROPFIRST >\" . < PROPFIRST > .. \ " You know Mommy .. Birds don't have to celebrate Earth Day .. they already do everything right . \ " \ " You know .. they don't drive cars .. they fly\ " .. me .. \ " mumble mumble .. \"" 
the bad news is my Hy macaw < PROPFEMALE > stole my < PROPFEMALE > earring out of my ear .. the good news is .. I managed to pry that monster beak open and shake it out before either 1)it was destroyed or 2 ) she swallowed it . < PROPMALE > just looked at me ( with that look ) and said .. \now give me the other one\ " .. ok < PROPFEMALE > .. you win .. " 
man .. nasty storm .. no signal for tv .. missing Glee .. hoping we don't get zapped by lightning .. 
hmmm .. Obama speaking late on a Sunday night in a few minutes .. wonder what this is going to be about .. 
Sooo ... < PROPMALE > .. upon his last of 7 overnight shifts in a row .. calls and wakes me to tell me he got his wrist smashed in an elevator last night and he if off to Occ . Med . before he comes home . I really don't know where to begin .. but lets just hope all the numbness and tingling goes away .. and it is ok .. Geesh what the heck ? 
Mom admitted to hospital with pneumonia . I have to say .. I've been at this hospital more in the last few months than in my entire life . .. 
ok , saw this on my sis's < PROPFEMALE > .. had to share ... \New drink : It's the Bin Laden . It's two shots and a splash of water\ " ... LOL !! "
