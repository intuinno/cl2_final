seems to me that life is just rushing by in one huge blur , and everyone but me is changing 
I cant count on much in this crazy world ... but i can always count on you ... hopefully ... 
why is it that no matter what i do no matter where i go or how hard i try to get you out of my head , everything leads back to you ? i just need to stop trying and maybe it will just float away ... 
when do you know you have lost friends ? is it when you make plans , and they flake for someone else , time and time again , it happens so much lately ... 
im goin on an adventure in Narnia , anyone care to join ?

What we've got here is ... failure to communicate 
\Whats so Civil about War anyway \"" 
I have voices in my head ... but they speak Spanish , and i have no idea what they're saying 
I'm not saying cannibalism is right but , If you had to eat another human to survive , do you think they'd taste like their ethnic background ? 
Golf and alcohol don't mix , that's why I don't drink and drive !!!! 
\Dear God the only thing I ask of you Is to hold her when I'm not around When I'm much too far away\ " <3 " 
well ... its been an awesome ride Mavs , but thats it we're done for the season , there's always next year ( like nobody here hasn't heard that before ... ) 
Idk why it is that I can't ever sustain a good mood , I was in the best mood today during and after school , but as soon as My family got home , it was gone , they just know when I'm in a great mood , and all they do is bring me down , thanks alot family for ruining my mood once again 
Great game mavs , please keep the momentum going for Thursday !!! We need it 
He who makes a beast out of himself , gets rid of the pain of being a man

“Meow” means “woof” in cat

\You better lose yourself in the music 
\I've been travelin ' on this road too long\ 
Made wind symphony !!!!

what the hell is wrong with me ??? :( 
I'm at work and I can't stop crying , I'm in for a long next five hours 
listening to \I'm So Hood\ " damn i havent heard this song in years !!!! " 
Music is my only good outlet , but lately i cant listen to my ipod because i hear 50 songs in a row that remind me of her :/ and theres no tellin what im gonna hear when i turn the radio on .... 
S(s-s-s)-A(a-a-a)-F(f-f-f)-T (t-t- t)-E(e-e-e)-Y(y-y-y ) Dance 
I'm not crazy , I'm just a little unwell I know , right now you can't tell , But stay awhile , and maybe then you'll see , A different side of me , \ 
I'm not crazy , I'm just a little impaired I know , right now you don't care , But soon enough you're gonna think of me , And how I used to be ... 
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I .. \ 
got out of bed at all\ 
The morning rain clouds up my window .. \ 
and I can't see at all\ 
And even if I could it'd all be gray , \ 
put your picture on my wall\ 
It reminds me , that it's not so bad , \ 
it's not so bad .. 
\If I go crazy then will you still \

DFW DIGS < PROPMALE > !!!!!!!!!! 
well now that was pretty much the worst dream ive had in a long time ... a huge thunderstorm , everything was dark all i could hear was pouring rain and see was lightning , and there was nobody else there 
\Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away ? \"" 
Kinda confused , but I've gotta feeling it's all gonna be ok 
in my mind , yesterday didnt even happen , its all about the now and the future

Bored out of my mind , anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > !? 
These feelings won't go away\ 
They've been knockin ' me sideways\ 
I keep thinking in a moment that\ 
Time will take them away\ 
But these feelings won't go away 
apparently i give off a really chill , laid back vibe , its interesting to know what people think of you , ya kno ? 
why am i so scared to move forward , it seems that for every 1 step i take forward i move back 2 , these are all just minor set backs for now , i hope ... 
I absolutely LOVE stand-up comedy !!!!!! <3 \ 
its the greatest form of entertainment , next to music !!!! 
I'm a space-bound rocketship and your heart's the moon\ 
And I'm aimin ' right at you\ 
Right at you

Is anybody out there ? \ 
It feels like I'm talkin to myself\ 
No one seems to know my struggle\ 
And everything I come from\ 
Can anybody hear me ? \ 
It guess I keep talkin to myself\ 
It feels like I'm going insane\ 
Am I the one whose crazy ? 
I wish you would step back from that ledge , my friend\ 
You could cut ties with all the lies , that you've been living in\ 
And if you do not want to see me again\ 
I would understand , I would understand

Everyone i know has got a reason to say , \you can put the past away \""

I've broken my heart so many times , i stopped keeping track ... 
for some strange reason i have The Temptations stuck in my head ... 
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge , I'm trying not to lose my head 
It's like a jungle sometimes , it makes me wonder how I keep from goin under ... 
I know you wanna leave me , but i refuse to let you go , if i have to beg and plead for your sympathy , i dont mind cause you mean that much to me 
I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do . Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real , I say that you do . 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows when it snows and its twenty-below 
Too late , for the other side , caught in a < PROPMALE > twenty-five to life
