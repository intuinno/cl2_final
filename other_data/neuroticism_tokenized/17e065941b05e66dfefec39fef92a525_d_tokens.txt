Chillin ' \haha\ " in Tucson with the family . Good to be out of town for a while . " 
In < PROPFEMALE > with Mom . She had knee replacement surgery two days ago . She has since had a stroke . She had no feeling in her left side . Some feeling and movement has returned to her hand and face . Prayers are needed . 
Mom ( < PROPFEMALE > Bruns ) is doing alright today . She lost the improvement in her hand but she has maintained the sensation in her face even though her face still droops . Your prayers are a blessing and we < PROPFEMALE > your continued efforts . 
Hey all . Mom responded to < PROPFIRST > tickling her foot today . She still cannot move her arm or leg , but the response to stimulation is encouraging . She has moved to the rehab unit and will begin working hard tomorrow . 
Mom did very well today . When the neurologist visited her , she was able to lift her left foot up about 4 inches to meet his hand ! Her arm is still not moving , but she has had some return of sensation . What a difference a day makes ! Thank you all for your continued prayers ! 
Mom is really doing well . Her face is almost back 100% looking at it , but the sensation is not back . She was able to lift her leg again today for the doctor . < PROPFIRST > doesn't ever she it and she has performance anxiety when he is there and cannot manage to do it for him . They took her today for another MRI and will get the results back soon . Thank all of you for your encouragement and prayer . 
Had a blast on the Rio Frio this past weekend ! Our church family is truely the best ! Update on Mom is good . Mom continues to improve . She moved from the bed onto a transfer board making transfer to the wheelchair easier . She was also able to use her good arm to push herself up in bed . On the phone today the slurring was hardly present . She is getting homesick . Thank you for your continued prayers . 
Another prayer request . < PROPMALE > McDonald , the son of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > McDonald was shot in the chest . He is doing well , but please send up a prayer for him and the family . More details to come . 
Mom is doing pretty good . She suffered an impingement in her knee on Sunday and is still experiencing some swelling from that . Her time for the hospital is up on Friday . She will be moved to a skilled nursing facility for further rehab . She is very homesick . She says thank you for all the care , concern and prayers through this difficult time . 
Copied from < PROPFEMALE > - Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is not a cure and it's definitely not contagious . They want what we all want ... to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this , but in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help and understanding ... Will ......... you copy , paste , and leave this as your status for at least an hour 
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ , for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes . . . For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith ; as it is written , \THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH . \ " Rom 1:16 -17 " 
Time is a great teacher , but unfortunately it kills all its pupils ... - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Berlioz 
A computer once beat me at chess , but it was no match for me at kick boxing .

Looking for results from the Tall City Marching Contest from yesterday . Specifically , how did Abilene High do ? 
My Nephew , Peyton , was hospitalized today with a staph infection on his stomach . We don't know how long he will be there . Prayers please ! 
Peyton Update : About 9pm last night they drained the infection on Peyton's stomach and removed 7ccs of puss . That is a significant amount from a 1 year old's body . They are expecting the hospital stay to exend to the weekend . Thanks to everyone for the prayers and well wishes . We are blessed to have so many Christian friends ! 
i pick my nose and people should always log off of thier facebooks 
Getting ready to travel to Midland for the Abilene High - Midland < PROPFIRST > football game . I will be working the mirror during the AHS band show . I will be the mirror that starts on the south end 40 yard line . For those interested in the game but not close enough to go , it will be televised on ESPN2 starting at 8pm . 
Got into town about 2am from Midland to find that all of our mirrors for the Abilene High Band show were broken ! We finished cleaning glass out of the truck and making a plan for contest Monday evening . What a nightmare ! 
I am headed out to go vote . If you haven't already , please do . You may not even like the choices , but remember that there are people in this world who have given their lives to participate in corrupt elections in hope of something better . Your chances of being killed to have your voice heard is so very very small . GO VOTE ! 
What has 3,000 friends , a 40 car motorcade , cuts down coconuts , moves 34 war ships and costs an estimated 1.8 billion ( yes , that is billion with a B) ? \
