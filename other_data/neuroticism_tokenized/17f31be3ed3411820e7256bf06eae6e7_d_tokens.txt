Turlock Shines was Fabulous ! nothing matches the inner warmth of helping pick up trash and working hard to help the community with friends . 
Should be doing homework but is wasting time on facebook instead =P

Had a crazy good time at the football game last night and at Lexis house after !!

Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is gay ( or are gay yourself ) .

Hey , just double checking .... do the articles for the Cold War reporting for Peterson have to be from the same Newspaper/periodical , or are we supposed to get different perspectives ?

I just did my nails and they look so good my mood is up at least three notches :P 
Im sorry , but IB is a choice and sitting at the front for graduation is not a big deal . Why should we get special priveleges beyond the excellent education and college opps ? Alphabetical order seems fair to me . 
Gud Nite ! I will continue my debate on a night when I have less HW .... :P
