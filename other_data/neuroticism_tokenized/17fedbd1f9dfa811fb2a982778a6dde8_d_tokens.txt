\ Remain positive despite people's negativeness . It is easy to sink down to their level ; it is harder and requires much more willpower to separate yourself from the people trying to put you down and try to bring them up . You possess the power to have a positive effect on everyone you meet ! Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise ! \""

Boyfriend Week : If you have a boyfriend who is your best friend , who works hard for you , who has been with you through thick and thin , who loves you even when you're at your worst , and whom you are proud to be with , copy and paste this with the date you started your relationship . - March 19th 2010 <3 
How can someone say something that just makes you want to break down and cry :'( 
So another movie nightt with < PROPFIRST > Andrews !! :) Heck yesss :) \ 
Waitin on the boyfriend to call me <3 
( Like ... )\ 
1 . Whats your name saved on my phone ? \ 
2 . How long have I known you ? \ 
3 . What's my most memorable moment with you ? \ 
4 . Would i < PROPFEMALE > with you ? \ 
5 . Word to describe you ? \ 
6 . Would i care if i lost you ? \ 
7 . What i love about you ? \ 
8 . What i hate about you ? 
Distance is not for the fearful . It is for the bold . It's for those who are willing to spend a lot of time apart in exchange for a little time with the one they love . It's for those who know a good thing when they see it , even if they don't see it nearly enough . <3 I love RJH :)
