Not a good day . 

I'm spending the evening sketching 
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > tales of yesterday , will grow but never die , \ 
I can fly , my friends ! 
Some people call me the space cowboy yeah\ 
Some call me the gangster of love\ 
Some people call me Maurice\ 
Cause ' I speak of the pompetous of love 
Another Saturday night with just me and my sketchpad ... 
My quarterback and ur quarterback r sittin by the fire , my quarterback told ur quarterback I'm gunna make ur a$$ retire , talkn bout Who Dat Who Dat ! 
The Saints WIN ! Favre shoulda retired last year !
