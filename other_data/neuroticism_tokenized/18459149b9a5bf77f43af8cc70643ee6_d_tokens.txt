Have a lovely day , be safe !! \ 
Who just saw Gorden try and fight that guy ? \ 
It's like hockey , they should have let them fight it out a bit ! 
Hey man , you ever think there's going to be this massive nuclear \ 
holocaust and after all the < PROPMALE > nations are destroyed it'll just be \ 
the tribes in the jungles that rise up and survive . That jungle warfare \ 
is going to rule the world ? \ 
haha I love the Office <3 
Yay < PROPFIRST > is coming over <3 
Makes my head dizzy waiting for a sound from my phone or skype that won't come . \ 
Lame stuff . \ 
Good night\ 
My nephew wanted a pink car and so I made him one ! \ 
Sanded one of his cars down and got out my paint and now he is watching the paint dry ! \ 
It's good to have him around =] \ 
Have a nice day everyone\ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > does not lose contest\ 
He wins them\ 
Or quits them\ 
Because they are unfair\ 
Soooo my nephew finally crashed out around 6ish and is still asleep . I think this might be a disaster for the night ? \ 
Because I am almost positive that he will wake up and he will be cranky and not want to go back to sleep . \ 
Fun stuff 
Sick is coming back\ 
My best friend is ?? \ 
NyQuil !! \ 
Sweet Dreams 
Eccleslastes \ 
A time to be born\ 
& a time to die ;\ 
A time to plant\ 
& a time to pluck what is planted ;\ 
A time to kill\ 
& a time to heal ;\ 
A time to break down\ 
& a time to build up ;\ 
A time to weep\ 
& a time to laugh ;\ 
A time to mourn\ 
& a time to dance ;\ 
A time to cast away stones\ 
& a time to gather stones ; 
I totally kicked < PROPMALE>'s ass in Black Ops !! \ 
Fun stuff\ 
Going to Mariposa ! \ 
No cell phone service , I love it !! \

No one click on the texting and driving link\ 
I think I got it from < PROPMALE > , Thanks < PROPMALE > ! 
If life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're going to get . \ 
And I don't even care for chocolate , and if I do have chocolate it must be with caramel . \ 
What does that say about my life ?? \ 
Haha just a little < PROPMALE > Gump thought I had . \ 
Now 24hours of not sleeping . It agrees with me I swear . \

Okay in The Hangover they never say how the chicken got in the room ! \

I <3 the rain ! 
Looking 12 finally worked for me ! \ 
At the hockey game and kids only get free jerseys and so I got one !! \ 
Hopefully a good winning game !! 
The main reason I go to a hockey game is to watch a good fight ! But the refs wouldn't let a good fight go on . LAME ! and thunder lost =\\\ 
Who knows how the UFC fights went down ? \ 
It was tonight right ? 
Who has The Chronicles Of Narnia books ? \ 
I want to read them !! 
Oh come on 49ers ! \ 
Are preseason games show Such promise ! \ 
Then that promise is broken in the games that actually count . \ 
Lame . \ 
Oh well , as long as they beat the raiders and I have something to brag about to my < PROPMALE > , her husband and kid . That is okay with me . \ 
But I guess it is good I started to like the Ravens a few years back anyways . They aren't too bad right now . \ 
Hope everyone has a nice Sunday .

body had a brilliant idea , with its Other brilliant ideas like failing \ 
kidney , nerve damage & all you can see where those would be hard to \ 
beat . \ 
But tonight when I have court in < 3 hours my body thought it would be fun to not sleep . \ 
Best of yet I'm in crazy amounts of pain right now which isn't fun and has made breathing really hard . \ 
I'm sleep deprived on a really stressed level , so yes I'm ranting . 
Okay , lovely . \ 
Didn't go horrible . \

I'm stuck being wide awake because my pharmacist and my brother scared me into not taking these new pills my doctor gave me to help me sleep . \ 
It can give me like a < PROPFEMALE > over effect , which if I don't get the fun of drinking then why deal with the < PROPFEMALE > over ? \ 
Although a good nights rest might be worth it . \ 
I don't know . I don't think I'll try it tonight ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone =] 
They looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears ! 
Jesus wasn't even born today , bet a lot of you didn't know that ! \

So he proceeds on to say Good job boy . \ 
Remember you can only play with knives when ... Oh wait that's wrong . \

I don't think anyone at the head table realized how happy coffee could make us ! \ 
If the coach only got it right in the morning the day would have been much more pleasant . \ 
Got to watch a few good wrestling matches , I definitely enjoy being able to watch the wrestling more than working the head table . But it ended up being fun anyways . \ 
Tired and ready to get ready for DisneyLand !

Is being an adult learning that you should always tell the truth ? \ 
Or is it learning that sometimes you should lie ? \ 
I guess that seems very rhetorical . \ 
Because ' Duh!' you * should * never lie . \ 
But we are also in situations we * shouldn't * be in sometimes . \ 
Changes things a bit .
