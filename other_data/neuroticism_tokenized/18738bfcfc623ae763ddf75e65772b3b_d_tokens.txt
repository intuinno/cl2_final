is planning to have fun this weekend ... <> 
did have fun this weekend !!!! 
is riding the emotional roller coaster called life ... Wheee ! 
To look at him every night\ 
Her soul her instincts spur ;\ 
And as he looks at her for weeks\ 
He falls in love with her . \ 
\ 
And as on her elbows she leans\ 
Her < PROPFEMALE > and her whim\ 
She feels in her heart and soul that\ 
She falls in love with him . 
A wild path through the woods\ 
Walking along waterfalls\ 
Pacing high and low\ 
A hand stretch , a touch\ 
The breadth of your arms\ 
Holding me close to your heart\ 
The depth of your palm\ 
A perfect place for my face to rest\ 
Your soft shoulder where\ 
I breathe and rest on happiness 
Leadership development can be fun ( if Pliny the Elder is invited ) ... 
Whether you think you can or you can't , you're right ...

If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make , who would you call and what would you say ? And why are you waiting ? ~ Stephen Levine 
is feeling refreshed and relaxed , with a little smile on his face ... 
It is only with one's heart that one can see clearly . \ 
What is essential is invisible to the eye . 
May this Christmas season\ 
fill your home with joy\ 
your heart with love\ 
and your life with laughter . 
We are not here to fit in , be well balanced , or provide exempla for others . We are here to be eccentric , different , perhaps strange , perhaps merely to add our small piece , our little clunky , chunky selves , to the great mosaic of being . As the gods intended , we are here to become more and more ourselves -- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 
Today is the First Day of the Rest of Your Life 
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity ; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty . - < PROPMALE > Churchill 
The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keep out the joy . ~ Jim Rohn 
The word ' happiness ' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness . ~ Carl < PROPFEMALE > 
Looking forward to time spent in Death Valley ...
