If I were a superhero , what would my superhero name be ? 

Kat's leaving for the weekend to visit some friends . I want her to have fun , but I'm gonna miss her . 
Have you ever said something and even as you were saying it you knew it was the wrong thing to say ? Well I've < PROPMALE > doing that alot lately . I guess some times I just can't help myself , no matter how detrimental it may be to me . 
O . k ..., the Bucks pulled out the W , but boy was it ugly . Definately got some work to do for next week huh . ( wtf ) 
I just found out today that a friend of mine , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , past away the first of the month . I'm in total shock . I know that I hadn't talked to him in a while , but the last time I did he was just so full of life . He was so thrilled to be a dad for the second time . I just don't understand how some one as good as this man was can pass on so damn young . I mean he was only my age . 
Anyone wanna go do anything tonight , I'm bored off my ass . Let me know . 
I can't believe I wrecked my truck last night . This really sucks . 
Looking 4 a new job , any suggestions . 
Anyone know where i can get some shrooms ? 
Why's it so hard to get ahead in life ? 
Got fired tonight . 
hope things get better
