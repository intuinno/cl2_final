When you < PROPFEMALE > a Bible , Satan gets a headache . When you open It , he collapses . When he sees you reading It , he faints . When he sees that you're living according to what you're reading , he disappears . When you're about to copy this message onto your status , he will try to discourage you . I just defeated him . Copy and paste to your status .... 
“Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence . Talent will not ; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent . Genius will not ; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb . Education will not ; the world is full of educated derelicts . Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent .

MEN : IF YOU FEEL SHE IS SLUTTY AND U DON'T WANT HER ... LEAVER HER ALONE ! DON'T DO UR BUSINESS WITH HER AND THEN LEAVE HER ALONE . JUST LEAVE HER ALONE !

So u have left and right , and right and wrong . Does that make left wrong ? who says that right is never wrong and wrong isn't right ? maybe right is just not right ... 
ALL WOMEN PLS ANSWER This is a real survey : What are your pet peaves when it comes to salon services , and what can be done to make it better ? Inbox me if your thoughts are too long . Ask your friend girls as well . Thanx (= 
WOMEN : I have gathered so far that most of you do not like spending too much time in the salon , and over booking is an issue for most of you . Cosmetologist overbook so they are not underbooked . How many of you have ever set an appointment to go to the salon , and not shown up ? Pls be honest . If you have why did you , and did you call in advance to cancel ? How far in advance did you cancel ? 
ALL THAT I CAN SAY ... (= 
Nothing makes me more sad than a non-church goer making excuses as to y he or she will not join or at least go to church . TO Church goers : stop looking down at ppl , gossiping , and being contradicting ; it gives christians a bad name . Non church goers : you need to know the reason church is important . Do you go to church to learn about Christ or for < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and them ? 
y is every1 so damned mopey today ? its about loving ppl ... smh 
Everybody plays the fool ...
