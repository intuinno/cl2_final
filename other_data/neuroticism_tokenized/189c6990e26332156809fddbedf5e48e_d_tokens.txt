All I've got to do is stick it out for one more year , it all falls into place after . 
bayonetta , devil may cry 4 , walking around phoenix incredibly late in the night . fun week . 
advice for threatening people : be intimidating and sexual . 
a terrible , boring , amercanized version of a terrible , boring , british TV show . ( torchwood ) why fox . why . 
CONAN WHAT IS BEST IN LIFE . 
I wonder if my camera company didn't think I'd notice they just stuck a new camera in the old box when I sent it in for repairs . 
I SHOULD UPLOAD PHOTOS OF MYSELF IN BLACK AND WHITE ( that's what all the cool kids do ) 
< PROPMALE > weaving might play the red skull ? yes please .

facebook confession #1 : I enjoy kindom hearts games 
facebook confession #2 : i fucking love smallville . best tv show ever . 
doesn't kick ass come out in like a week HOLY FUCK I THINK KICK-ASS COMES OUT IN LIKE A WEEK 
FACEBOOK CONFESSION #iforget : kiss from a < PROPFEMALE > is on my ipod . 
so me and a friend decided to make a single screen platformer , atleast it gives me something to pixel on . 
it's < PROPFEMALE > as fuck outside . I should take some ~ ~ ARTSY ~ ~ photos 
who thinks I should make a Kamen Rider game 
So I started writing a fantasy story about a pretty laid back guy who tries to stand up for everything but also makes jokes about the people around him . Halfway through the story , I stopped , looked in the mirror and said ' Whoah , man . This story is about me , man . \ " , 201 0-0 4-14 05:29:47 " 
christ i wish friday was here . I can't wiat to see kick-ass 
How many states can you name off the top of your head ? 
man , holy crap . the fact that ego raptor has a new series and i didn't find out until today is proof enough I haven't done shitall on the internet in months but < PROPFIRST > and TVtropes 
I'm thinking maybe start a new story . I have one already , but I'm thinking about not continuing it . Anyone want to proofread ? 
when you call internet friends by their real names you might have known them too long 
lady gaga isn't that bad . just listened to telephone . peace . 
< PROPMALE > , Deadpool , Captain < PROPFEMALE > , Iron Man , Morrigan Aensland , Ryu , The Incredible Hulk , Wolverine , Super Skrull , < PROPFIRST > Redfield , Chun-Li . What's with the names ? That's the < PROPFEMALE > Vs . Capcom 3 roster , ya jive turkey . 
totally spies is getting a new season 
started planning a book this morning ( like a whole novel ) making character interesting and different from eachother is pretty damn difficult 
this is the third week in a row the place i'm supposed to be working at has told me i'd start in a week . i need to find a new job . 
just got back from KFC/Seeing the losers . two things : never eat a double down ( you will feel fat ) and the movie was awesome . 
does anyone wanna play some [ online game ] later ?? s4 league , neotokyo , modern warfare ?? 
found the rifle i want to buy . now to get money . 
And then a dilemma . Write an absolutely serious almost deconstruction of the vampire novel , or do a complete parody of everything people like about them ( set in college ) 
DC is absolutely hilarious . the wonder woman animated flick didn't sell so well . they were going to do a batgirl movie , but because wonder woman didn't sell well this means it was absolutely 100% because the characters gender apparently . the execs reined in : ' no more female superhero movies indefinately . ' 
Question for everyone : How do you start your day ? 
Someone reccomend me music . 
is anyone ELSE having ridiculous wind tonight 
finished all the graphics for < PROPFIRST > i was working on . now i can go backt o personal projects . 
what is everyone planning on doing this summer ? 
haha , DC is the biggest < PROPMALE > moore troll . the watchmen cast is being integrated into the regular universe 
Okay guys . Black Sabbath ... Ozzy or Dio ? 
political discourse , video games . i'm about to watch justice leage : crisis on two earths . 
Under The Red Hood looks friggin sweet . Finished Crisis on Two Earths last night . Kind of weird how Public Enemies has bats going toe to toe with the super powered , but in Crisis on Two Earths he gets his ass kicked by almost everyone . 
i want to sleep with lady gaga 
actually i gotta add < PROPFEMALE > hendricks to my list of ' celebrities i want to sleep with ' 
artistotle ? covered . causality ? covered . i feel like in the mood for some american history , all this philosophy is making me feel depressed . 
Captain < PROPFEMALE > Vs . Big Boss , who wins ? 
i wonder if it would be a faux pas for a theater in haiti to run tremors 
is there a way to block people on facebook so you never have to acknowledge their presence or comments ? if so , tell me how . 
I hate this bullshit ass idea of ' redistribute the wealth ' 
my top three movies are officially unbalanced . it's now Iron Man , Iron Man 2 and Lethal Weapon 2 
so far facebook has suggested i add like fifty of < PROPFIRST>'s friends , and nobody i actually know IRL .

L . A wants too boycott arizona ? Maybe it's time we stopped selling them electricity . 
i'm glad i downloaded the humble indie bundle . aquaria might be best 
job interview at 10:30 ? pffftftf , staying up all night watching justice league is perfectly reasonable .

mewhat the fuck , new < PROPMALE > 10 and generator < PROPMALE > start without 
gears of war is ripping off kill . switch , and kill . switch is ripping off operation winback . and operation winback was originally intended as a more tactical based metal gear , which is what splinter cell is . splinter cell was based on a draft by < PROPMALE > clancy , who wrote a movie that starred < PROPMALE > berrenger , who stayed with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > in college , who named his daughter < PROPFEMALE > \ 
gears of war is ripping off < PROPFEMALE > !

oh hey , big boss , i respect you again 
no product placement in the american version of peace < PROPMALE > , sad face . 
snake this is mcdonald miller 
guys what if letters and punctuation were a finite resource , and anytime you wanted to write something you had to literally take letters from other literary works 
hey whoah holy SHIT , i did something constructive today 
i don't even know what iirc means , fuck you guys . 
i'd be excited for metal gear rising but it's for a system i don't own and will never buy 
i like that if you say shit about < PROPFIRST > robertson or a film director people automatically use the flawed logic that because you aren't equally as skilled as they supposedly are you can't make a criticism about them\ 
thanks , internet 
can't wait to main < PROPMALE > and kick the shit out of the hulk repeatedly 
METAL GEAR RISING LOOKS FUCKIN SWEET jesus 
e3 : microsoft pressconference : hehe microsoft still sucks ( metal gear rising , bulletstorm only two good things ) ea press conference : lasertag for consoles , nerdiest thing ever 
wow the ' < PROPFEMALE > of despair ' graphics are fucking ridiculous . they reused every tileset , monster and character from the post ps1 castlevanias that were 2D 
i actually don't think the bossfights in peacewalker are meant to be played with any less then a full fucking party . i spent an hour fighting the chrysalis today ( which you can't use any missile based/explosive weapons on so you're forced to stick with regular guns ) and then guess what ? after playing for an hour i did a single bar of damage and then died after it shot me four times with a railgun . 
Freedom . 
OH man , zelda : skyward sword looks GREAT . it's like how i imagined the original zeldas were supposed to look 
marxism and socialism aren't good ideas ' in practice ' or ' on paper ' that don't work in real life . if it doesn't work in reality , it's just a bad idea . \ 
fuck yeah , capitalism is awesome . 
I wonder how < PROPMALE > Lobb feels about the KLOBB in goldeneye being renamed . 
\It's not racist 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfdUYf8HOvc 
i doon't wanna work today 
i don't think DC can set the bar any lower than < PROPMALE > hex , so maybe now we can get a decent question movie 
< PROPFEMALE > is planning on doing 10 minute shorts before every new movie , that introduces otherr superheroes , apparrently miss < PROPFEMALE > , iron fist and < PROPMALE > cage are planned . 
goddamnit facebook , i don't want to use your mysterious technomagic photo uploader , give me the old one . 
\For many 
what the fuck do you mean , game i spent 10$ , i cant play you without the classic controller ? fuck you nintendo . 
I need help securing a voice role . 
majoras mask is cool 
i've been thinking , and i'm pretty sure ' yeastwolf ' is a great name for a post hxc band 
reading kamen rider spirits . < PROPFEMALE > 37-38 , just got goosebumps 
the last band you listened to becomes a reggae band\ 
your reaction 
just got back from the last airbender . m . night shamylamydingdong did it okay , but it could've been a LOT better . 
avatar sucked , but it's a good thing MGS rising comBULLETSTORM 
why would i buy a black and yellow track suit ? it's not like this a game of death or anything 
By wearing an upside-down cross , Satanists are unwittingly showing \ 
humility and unworthiness before Christ . That makes about as much sense \ 
as a neo-Nazi sticking it to the Jews by swearing off pork for life . \ 
Take that ! \\ 
i think i have food poisoning , oh well i can't call in apparently ! time to go to work 
Happy fourth . I'm glad we decided to fuck someone shit up with muskets and declarations\

wow , i just realized when my hair gets longer i'm gonna have takamasa suga's hair 
cost of a kamen rider helmet : 215$ cost to ship kamen rider helmet to house : 60$ cost to repair the split in kamen rider helmet that appeared in two places after trying it on on the first time : HEH 
probably am going to end up shelling out 600$ for the rest of my costume . am never going to have a girlfriend again , peace 
can never think of my parents as ' old ' 
hot tub time machine is an amazing piece of film . it belongs in the smithsonian .

i need something to play fightin ' games online that's not shitty kaillera 
made 30 dollars at work in tips , got told i might get more hours , actually getting things accomplished i set out to do\

Tomorrow I'd like to write a pulp adventure story , I think . Can anyone direct me to modern day examples of pulp fiction that aren't the Rocketeer ? I'm looking for specifically the ' hero ' genre . 
About to play some Minecraft , got a little bit of a story going on here . 
who has minecraft 
... so tired 
Do we really need another everquest ? 
looked at my kingdom i was finally there , to sit on my throne as the < PROPMALE > of MY PARENTS ARE DEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAD 
Okay so basically I have a horrible fear of warehouses and industrialized buildings . \ 
Thanks , Resident Evil !

The Expendables was good but ... \ 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim VS . the World is the best movie this year all years . It was AMAZING . 
anybody else having problems buying stuff on playstation network ? 
oh man how HIGH would you have to BE to say that 
this doesn't deserve to sound this great 
women didn't kill chivalry , sliding glass doors did . 
my night , and attitude , is completely fucking ruined . i guess that's what i get for having comcast as my ISP . 
I think my TV or wii is broken . 
fffffuuuck my life . 
work sucked , but i got to spend the night with the best people i know 
scatman < PROPFIRST > puts anyone in a good man . 
dr. pepper was around in 1885 . this means that it would not be improbable to have a story about a ' sweet rad ' detective who goes to get a soda . 
adding people you never talk to and have nothing in common with : because not only is it not awkward , it completely helps cultivate healthy relationships ! 
It's time we all cap off the night . We all learned something today , maybe it was a piece of news , maybe it was how to do something . \ 
We all talked to somebody who we share a connection with today , and we should always remember those important connections . \ 
We are responsible for each other . That's part of being\ 
human -- isn't it ? 
It's morning : let's start a new day ever hopeful to what we can accomplish . 
Heading off to work , we often wish and we didn't have to . It is important to realize that without work , nothing would be worth having . 
Another day ends . 
it's a good thing i caught myself listening to motion city soundtrack before i had a < PROPMALE > to start liking it , heyo . 
everytime i eat fast food i'm ALWAYS sick the day after 
my stomach is trying to let me know it hates my existence and wants me to die 
was just watching ' rookie blue ' with < PROPFEMALE > peregrym . just kind of listening in ; all of the sudden the nerdy officer : \what is a man ? a miserable little pile of secrets \"" 
lousy stupid goddamn supportive friends 
no more heroes 2 today . yess , cant wait to play it . 
Everyone deals with grief differently . Some people fuck at funerals - I cut heads off . \ 
i love you suda 51 
I wish I could become a fan of my parents on facebook . 
Plan trip to go see < PROPFIRST > pilgrim in theaters - 3 hours . \ 
Invite friend to go see < PROPFIRST > pilgrim and wait for them to get off of work - 2 hours\ 
Have friend cancel and find out < PROPFIRST > pilgrim is the lowest grossing comic book adaptation of all time and no longer in theaters - priceless .

aw man . they couldn't get an actual composer for the new mortal kombat so instead i'll have to listen to DISTURBED while i play it . lame . 
so i had the most bizarre dream ever . my brother , tyvon , < PROPFIRST > ( who i hardly ever talk to ) and some other guy all went to the mall . button < PROPFEMALE > , steampunk gamestop , basketball tryouts . 
suddenly i feel great . what's the deal , man ? 
vanquish is the best game i've played on any console . there , i said it . 
So , remember , It's not sexist for a victimized , psychopathic criminal in an abusive relationship to exist as a piece of evil T&A , but it is for a female character to have an emotional breakdown . 
WHAT TIME IS IT 
what , kayo satoh is a dude ? i am so fucking confused right now .

The town I pegged as small , and stifling ... wasn't any of those things . 
Had a blast on minecraft tonight , you guys are great . 
And that's why J.J. Pays ME the big bucks ! 
Seriously considering joining the navy .

there's going to be another vanquish demo in like a month 
I like that < PROPMALE > keaton is now apparently the definitive voice for spiderman . badass .

I'm probably alone in this , but Samus ' reasoning for not using missiles/bombs etc in other M is perfectly reasonable and makes sense to me . 
Resident Evil Afterlife : The only horror movie where the black guy is the best possible part of the whole film . 
literally cannot put down Other M . 
The Last Metroid Is In Captivity\ 
.... The Galaxy Is At Peace . \ 
God damn , this game has the best fucking intro in the world holy shit . 
Why is it , that megaman zero , the capcom game series with the best possible < PROPMALE > direction , never got to do anything awesome with it . 
It's really a shame when people will actively tout a game as ' sexist ' because they really can't come up with any other reason for not liking it . 
Samus taught us that a girl doesn’t need brains to be successful . Brains are giant , evil , and vulnerable to missiles . 
girls are .... weird . 
Okay nerdbutts , what's the best song you know . 
ugh , this song . it's amazing . 
Will be surprised if < PROPFIRST > doesn't turn out to be a Vampire or Dracula by the end of the game . 
Forgot how good it felt to do something incredibly awesome . 
< PROPFIRST > Stossel needs to ditch FFox News , and Fox Business . He's too good for them . 
I'll put it out there : PLUR is bullshit . We're defined by the absence of unity , peace is a logical impossibility and respect should be earned , not given . 
How much of that suit is buyable . \ 
Just the arms , why ? Can't afford the rest ? \

I LOVE YOU

kanedaoh fuckin saved . zac efron isn't pla 
okay hollywood , i know i'm going to feel deeply sorry for asking this but\ 
why isn't there a liveaction gundam movie yet ? 
Three words ended a part of my life , just as three words began it . I wish .. for the morning sun come to vanquish this horrible night . 
I hope there's not a single part of you that thinks I didn't plan this whole thing . 
We are Sex Bob-Omb and we're here to make you think about death and get sad and stuff 
I guess if I could put my mood into words it would be somewhere between \Travis Touchdown\ " and \ " The Joker\ " \ 
look out your window ; what's the first thing you see . 
I realized something . Being a supervillain would be much more fun . 
what's the name of that batman villain who wore the suit and looked like a penguin - < PROPFIRST > , 2010 
If I could say a few words - I'd be a better public speaker . 
I've had a great night out , this wasn't it . 
Taskmaster is so boss . 
Has anyone done a deconstructed look at supervillains ever ? 
Girl , you're like a wi-fi hotspot in my heart . I just want to .. uh ... download illegal software off of you ? \I " 
THE BLACK WIND HOWLS ... \ 
that would be such a killer name for an ironically bad metal band 
Late night RP on < PROPFIRST > with crowell , zazen , nortalk and matrim . A fight every once in a while makes things a little more interesting , dont'cha think ? 
THE NEW < PROPMALE > POTTER MOVIE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT\ 
except when he was standing at his parents grave and i started dying fucking laughing\ 
because < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > would make a much better < PROPMALE > potter\ 
WIZARD BATMAN 
i cant wait to be a useless piece of shit all day and play all these videogames

Sorry , facebook , but I've gotta be successful today . 
I'm thankful that the indians didn't put up a better fight , \ 
That the Allied forces were victorious\ 
And that you're all bros ~

I'm not supposed to tear up . 
I'd just like to point out that FF12 is clearly about Balthier , clearly . 
And for all of you working retail today : \ 
I'm sorry .

Five years ago , I lost friends . We stopped talking .. or lost interest in that wonderful game , we all went our seperate ways . I miss you all , but .. I know we wouldn't have it any other way . \

Great . Makoto is probably my favorite character in Third Strike and I can't pull off the move that's central to her strategy on this keyboard 
I forgot how strikingly deep the world < PROPFEMALE > in FF12 is . I'm sure just like the monsters , there's a story behind every ruin and person . 
my god i just realized cam clarke is cyclops 
ughhhh ; this honk sob is so not fresh . and i have to get it on even worse tommorow 
probably losing my job ;

December 7th , 1941 .

Tell me a number in a message , I'll tell you what I think of you 
098-68776586 : you're a pretty cool bro who I disagree with often/appreciate the pixelart/going to tell everyone you love traps

honestly , we don't talk for me to form a basis on you , but when it comes to some brutal honesty i think you have weird taste in men , and you seem to have mellowed out 
5291 : You are so rad stop hating on yourself and talk more ): 
4-8-15-16-23-42 : you're like the coolest old guy ever , and if I didn't have work so much I'd probably stop by more .

nothing like mending some heartache by hanging with the most awesome girlfriend in the world 
2010 is about to end , AKA the year < PROPFEMALE > fox hopefully stopped acting in movies entirely 
> 40 dollars left in bank account\ 
> looks at steam's holiday deals\ 
> where did all of my money go ?? 
I've had heartbreak , I've had a girlfriend for a day , I've been lied to , I've gained ( and lost ) superpowers . I saved the earth , I became a villain . I had my first taste of success . \ 
2010 , You weren't nearly hard enough on me . 2011 , you better be at least Nintendo Hard .

The same thing has happened to me so many times now I can accurately predict exactly how it's going to play out . Gettin ' pretty sick of this . 
That's it , I'm done . No new years resolutions , no self improvement . Not a single thing is going right already , and it's not going to get better . I'm throwing in the towel early 2011 . \ 
My < PROPFEMALE > to stay inside a single day lead me to have the worst day I've had in the last couple of years . 
Don't stop ! The world has to stay above 55 or it's going to let people on ! 
FOX : buy good website ( myspace ) make it terrible , fall into web 3.0 , sell it when doesn't turn a profit .

You need greater concentration , and more practice . As it's only through practice that the student masters the < PROPMALE > .

MAGOICHI 
' watch a bunch of movies i haven't seen win awards they don't deserve ' what part of that sounds entertaining 
today is gonna be rough . i can already tell . 
broatine 
friends birthday was fun . thanks for stealing my keys , < PROPMALE > . 
Okay ... I get it ! I'm awake . Sometimes one of my cats are better alarms . 
Our practice will be different today . I want you to forget I'm your master , and attack me with everything you've learned . 
oh hey , next weekend is spring break . look at how out of touch i am 
A knife has never made anyone happy unless it was used for cooking . 
So the truth is my heart ached bad . I want to run back now , but .. stepping back only delays progress foreward , it never truly turns you around . 
It's sunday night , and all of the people I know are online . I don't know if this is depressing or good . 
If you < PROPMALE > two birds , you can catch two birds . 
The truth is I really did care . At that moment I had to destroy everything I had spent so long building , just so that one person could be happy . 
I MIGHT GET TO LEARN KAPU Kapu KUIALUA this really excites me 
wow , that's so awesome . i really needed this to happen to me again . 
BULLETSTORM 
a few hours of bulletstorm makes everything okay again 
Another day , spent staring at the ceiling . 
Feeling better 
You can't fail if you never try ? I hate that mentality . 
watching old attack of the show . does kperiera still do airquotes ? wear two shirts ? the more you know 
I was at work all day and didn't hear about the tsunami . My heart goes out . 
scarred for life 
Wow , I can't believe I've been away from THE INTERNET for three days . It's really weird getting so use to adaptability and constant information , and then not having any of it . 
VAGUE PHILOSOPHICAL WALL POST 
I know what the best thing in the world is . 
one of the kills in splatterhouse involves you punching a giant quadruped reptile in the butthole and ripping out it's lower intestine 
spent literally all day in the wilderness . want to build a pagoda somewhere only i can find it . 
It's easier to deal with the pain of regret than it is to deal with the pain of dedication . 
It doesn't matter who you are , where you live . If you think you're ugly , dumb , standoffish , strange , a freak , unique , or whatever . \ 
There's someone who will listen . I promise . 
Just got back from tthe rennaisance fair . More like the . \Pirates and tits\ " festival " 
Balance - Coordination - Timing - Speed - Power 
if you hear any rumors about me ; yes , yes and not legally in no specific order . 
If ANYONE wants to buy ANYTHING ( guitars , car , broken motorcycle , tables , chairs , books , a nice PC , mouse , keyboard . ) my friend has to make 1500 before tommorow or he's going ( back ) to jail . 
It's gonna be the future soon , and I wont always be this way . When the things that make me weak and strange get engineered away . 
I think I can definitely point out when I thought I've been in love , and when I've been in love now . 
Villainy is ... taking the easy way out . It's not being responsible for your actions , petulantly seeing yourself in the right 100% of the time . Selfishly and egotistically acting in only a perversion of ' the peoples ' interest . 
you know what needs to make a comeback ? hulkamania 
I'm going to sprite something if I have to be up all night to do it . LET'S ROCK , BABY . 
Bartender is such a good show . 
oh man , I need to find another job , and quick . 
Suckerpunch is an alright movie . 
Okay , now that I've really thought about it , I was actually pretty disappointed by Sucker Punch . It's not a bad movie , it's just Not Really Good 
trying to come up with good looking hair in a pixelart : HNNNNNNNGHHHHHHHH
