2 / 2+ / 2

Has anyone else noticed that aside from the hairtie , shoes and gloves , Ms. Pac-Man is essentially nude ?

was woken up at 7am this morning , and about threw a fit because she momentarily forgot that the Super Bowl was today . xD 
is chopping off her hair in about an hour . 
' s hair is < PROPFEMALE > short . 
It would seem that my Nook has finally gone to crap . Balls . >.<
