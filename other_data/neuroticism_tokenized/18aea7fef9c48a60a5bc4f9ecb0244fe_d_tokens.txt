You know when you like feel sick and when anything or anyone barely touches you , it hurts ?? welcome to the land of me 
Hopefully headin to the mall later with Saaji-poo 
going to the mall with Saaja Monai :) 
\It looked like God beat her with the ugly stick\ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > hahahaha . I love you < PROPFIRST > Albright and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
So I'm debating ... Saaja Monai brought up a good point ... do I wanna play varsity and pretty much be a bench warmer , but get my letter in basketball ... or should I play JV with all the play time in the world ( more or less ) , potential MVP ( maybe ) , and all that fun stuff , but not get the varsity experience or my letter ... 
Not sure what to do for the first day of school . I have OTC in the morning ... do I go to that and will I have a ride to school ? or just go to 3rd hour ?? 
I'm missing WCA soooo much now . :( 
To drive the < PROPFIRST > would be dumb , cause I send it back at you ... Shawty over the summer you might've boosted an inch but long as < PROPMALE>'s playin , get use to the bench . 
< PROPFEMALE > ( in all seriousness ): \Um 
ughhhhhh .... school tomorrow . :( 
first day of school was alright ... all the guys are a little cuter and more mature . this could turn out to be a good year :) 
\Does < PROPFIRST > Beiber have someone black in everyone of his videos ? \ " hahaha " 
You know it's your best friend when she laughs at you when you say a class is hard . hahaha . i love you < PROPFIRST > Albright lol 
I'm starting to wonder if basketball and track are really important to me . I know people are saying I could be good if I tried , but what if I haven't truly tried because I don't really care ? 
stressed out about school , basketball , life ... but most importantly who to go to homecoming with :( 
I've literally been sick for a month with a cold . :/ hopefully these two day of feeling worse means I'll start feeling better soon 
New favorite word : Broski ... or is it Brosky ? I'm not sure lol 
\Omg ... swimmers have the grosses bodies ever ! \ " \ 
So I met the man I'm gonna marry today ... :) 
Greatest day ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sesha said he'd go to homecoming with me aaaaand I got my permit ! everyone please keep < PROPFEMALE > Griffin and < PROPMALE > in your prayers because < PROPMALE>'s dad died of a heart attack :( 
Hopefully I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with Saaja Monai and < PROPMALE > Hawkins this weekend with < PROPFEMALE > :) 
I was gonna go to bed but thanks to < PROPMALE > Hawkins I realize Glee is on !!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH !!! I love < PROPFEMALE > :) 
worse day ever . I woke up and had that feeling that today would suck . there was a mis-understanding so I'm not going to homecoming with the person I thought I was ... totally bombed both my economics and pre-calc quizzes which took longer then I planned so I missed most of basketball ... and today's not even over 
You are looking at the < PROPMALE>'s group 4 wide reciever :) 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Cousins , < PROPMALE > , and I are doing a youth group road rally !!!!!!!!!! 
So ... are we Sherwoods that amazing that they had to make the \Sherwood rule\ " ? I'm not sure how fair that is < PROPFIRST > Horvath hahahaha . Had an awesome time at the road rally !!! " 
Powder puff on monday @ 7:00 :) i'll be the one on the < PROPMALE > team getting all the touch downs ;) 
For people going to powder puff , I'm #5 on the gold team . Yea , the one who'll get all the touch downs and sweeeeeet blocks ;) 
Oh dear ... the seniors honestly think their pathetic attempts at smack talk will work ?? HA ! go juniors !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! powder puff 2011 :) 
At the farmer's market with my so called girlfriend \ 
She hands me her cell phone , says it's my dad \ 
Man , this ain't my dad ! \ 
This is a cell phone ! \ 
I threw it on the ground ! \ 
What , you think I'm stupid ? \ 
I'm not a part of your system \ 
My dad's not a phone ! \ 
DUH ! 
\Why is my vagina vibrating ?! Oh ... it's Austin\ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > hahahahah ! " 
? I like it on my bed ? 
Getting ready for homecoming :) 
I'm officially a state fan . sorry u of m , but when ya need 3 people to tackle one guy ... 
Happy birhday Dad , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Price my tripod homie :) 
I was reading about the walkie talkie and I read it was a military invention . That suprised me because usually military stuff has strong names like alpache helicopter ... tomahawk missle ... Walkie talkie ? How did that slip through the system ? 
man . i have the cutest brother ever :) 
Woo !!!!!!!!!!! Cedar Point with < PROPFEMALE > DeWald !!!!!! I'm so excited . Stay tuned to see all our pictures :P 
It's no fun when you're one the losing end ... 
Hmm ... idk how I feel about getting a good enough grade to be in the top english and compostion classes and the top alg II at college level ... I took the COMPASS test so I could take some business/marketing classed at Macomb CC ... 
So maybe yelling at 6 or so kids on the bus for picking on a girl wasn't what God had in mind when He said to help \the least of these\ " of but I think it's a start ... " 
So I got this message to set my music player on shuffle then next it and that song will be the answer to these random questions . Here are some of the funny ones :\ 
3 . What do you like in a guy/girl ? Brown Eyed Girl\ 
6 . What's your motto ? Gettin Jiggy With It\ 
16 . What will they play at your funeral ? Honky Tonk Badonkydonk\ 
18 . What's your biggest fear ? My President is Black 
Unless you're my mom , dad , brother , or sister ... it takes a lot to get me mad . Now that I'm heated , I will make sure every single one of those kids go down . 
it's frustrating when you really like someone and think they like you but don't know how to make it obvious that you want to be together .... 
So I got a seasonal job at Banana Republic at the mall :) which is great except I have to work and I have basketball during thanksgiving break and the family is going to Kentucky ... so i'm temporarily home-less for that weekend lol
