is excited about tonights koinania ! 

I`m looking forward to a nice saturday night and a lazy day tomorrow with God . I`m glad there can be one day a week that I dont have to worry about anything but my walk with God . Yay Sundays ! 
Now that church is over it's time to finish up my lesson plans for the week long canoe trip . I'm getting more and more excited everyday ! 
Just got done writing my lesson for my trip . Now I'm super pumped ! A week with great friends and hopefully a ton of students on the Ausable River ! 
There`s nothing like lifeguarding a beautiful lake without a single person to watch . 
The workday is almost done and soon there will be swimming in an amazingly warm lake ! 
Work is done and it's time to relax . ... Ahh this is nice ... 
Just left the Machine Shop . Awesome show !
