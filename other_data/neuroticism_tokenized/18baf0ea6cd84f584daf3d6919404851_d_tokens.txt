Lions give you strength ; giants give you faith . Death is a charade ... You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid . 
I've been ashamed . I've been put down .. Head in my hands & life on the ground . You left Heaven to save liars & thieves , sinners like me . Your Blood sets us free ! 
Thank You God for moms ... They're the best ! 
This is bad . Why am I surprised when I find out that certain people are Christians ? Why are we so shy to share our faith ? What does this world have the we can't overcome ? Christ overcame DEATH ! Our God is so GOOD ! If He is in us , then we will overcome that stinkin devil by the word of our testimony . What are we waiting for ? Why are we afraid ? It's time to \go into the world and preach the good news to ALL creation \""
