Rule #32 : Enjoy the Little Things 
I have carried achild within my body . I have comforted a baby upon my chest . My body isnot model perfect , but when I look in the mirror I am happy because Isee a mother , and there is no greater honor or blessing . Make this your status if u are proud to be a mother !!!

of family . be there to help and love them . to help them be a better person . not to tear them down trying to push to make them fall ... )

A . < PROPMALE > - Sissy's Song ... 
Cry it out ... You can get through this .. Just remember to breathe .. 
Im done caring for people who dont care about me . I'm not wasting my life anymore there is too much important things going on and people who really do care that i need to focus on . 
so out of the bad stuff going on right now i have class tomorrow to hopefully help me with college and then i got a job and starting the end of next week as a Home Health < PROPFEMALE > !!! YEY !! 
Come to the conclusion that i'm going to be non stop busy here in a couple weeks with everything lol 
They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will ALWAYS love them .... Re-post if you are blessed to have at least 1 of these friends in your life . 
watching Zombieland for the 100th time haha it puts me in a good mood !! 
going to my orientation tomorrow for my new job im so excited !!! 
Sometimes you have to make really hard decisions in order to get to the life that u really want .. Gotta learn the ones who tear u down trying to get there .
