2011 I have BIG plans for you . 

I can't sleep : / 
Things are starting to feel so differently lately : ) 
Today , I woke up with a smile . 
I could get used to this : ) 
Doing things around the house & I'm anxious for later : ) 
What a wonderful day <3 
I fear that I may be loosing confindence in myself already . 
Yeah last night's dream didn't help me what so ever :( 
Will be back on in a jiffy . 
I'm feelin ' way too damn good (: 
4 days left HURfuckingRAY : ) 
Heading off to bed . Only three full days left . 
Why are hands so difficult to draw ? 
Last day of summer school ! : ) 
Doing stuff around the house and what not . 
I have so much to do and I'm already tired . 
Cleaning around the house then spending time with < PROPMALE > : ) 
Great I have a poison < PROPFEMALE > bubble on one of my toes . 
Yeah I'm heading to bed very soon 
You give me a basket case full of smiles <3 
Going to Wakefeild tonight <3 
Waiting for tomorrow . 
I hate how I get worried about every little thing when I know things are going perfectly fine . 
Honestly I feel pretty shitty . 
So things are all worked out and I'm in such a better mood now : ) 
I actually enjoyed the movie kick- Ass . 
He completes me . 
I feel so restless . 
Just got home from < PROPMALE>'s house . Now heading to bed . 
doing yardwork . 
I never expected that over a short period of time that I would feel so strongly for you like I do now , and even if the < PROPMALE > keep us apart . I know that I don't want to lose you ; you already mean the world to me . 
invader zim on netflix then bed . 
Taking care of my dad's mess , going to take a long walk , then heading home . Oh by the way I miss you <3 
waiting for tomorrow . 
Canobie Lake with < PROPMALE > today <3 
Feels like today's plans are up in the air , and having three full days of summer doesn't exactly help either . 
Going through my Zune ; cleaning out and adding new . 
A spicy grilled chesse sandwhich with hot sauce ? This tastes amazing ! 
The Legend of < PROPFEMALE > soundtracks always sound so soothing to me . 
is actually looking forward to tomorrow . 
Recommend me some music please ? 
Today would have been better if it wasn't so hot outside . 
I think I'll just head to bed then . 
People are ridiculous . 
Just got back from a wonderful time with < PROPMALE > ( : 
Playing some Legend of < PROPFEMALE > Ocarina of Time like a boss . 
Shit . 
I wish it would stop raining ... 
Sometimes it seems too good to be true , but I'm thankful for everyday I have with you . 
Oh how I dread the morning bus , mother why must you sleep ? 
2months today <3 It may not seem long but it went by so fast . 
\We're all in the gutter but some of us are looking up at the stars . \"" 
bed . 
I have all these thoughts running through my head ; and to be honest , it's quite overwhelming . 
Today was not a good day for me , just saying . 
honestly , i don`t think i have ever been as happy as i am now : ) 
( : ? uo ?? ?? ? u ? op ??, no ? 
Yeah , falling down the stairs is a great way to start the day . 
I am abnormally light headed .

Going to see Jackass 3d with dad tonight . And I love you < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sanborn . 
Just blah . 
Just got home from an amazing day . Now its time for some much needed sleep . 
I don't understand this apprehensive feeling I seem to have . 
Damn nature you scary ! 
I'm so ready for some sleep . 
I wish the guy that's redoing the roof would be a little more pleasent while he's right above my room . 
I have some much work to do tonight but at least I'm not stressed out anymore : ) 
SLEEP . 
Getting all four of my wisdom teeth out tomorrow , fun fun . 
stopping by school to drop off some papers this morning ... It's going to be a long day . 
Just got home from getting the wisdom teeth out and I never realized how annoying this process would be . UGH . 
Hopefully things will go as planned today . 
< PROPMALE > and I played hide and seek today haha <3 : D

I just woke up , thanks dad . 
today was a good day . 
Theres way too much on my mind ... 
I have so much to do today , but I also have a lack of ambition .
