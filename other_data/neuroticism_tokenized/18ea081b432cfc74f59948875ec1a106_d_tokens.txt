You'll never believe what I saw in Times Square . There was a woman with shorts and a guitar , but nothing from the hip up >.< \

don't find < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , he finds you 
If at first you don't succeed , you were probably trying to \ 
defeat < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Goin on a cruise for a week , be back Saturday . I love y'all :'( 
Made a floating chair in da Bahamas with a beach chair and two life vests . \ 
I also developed a strategy for Dutch on an airplane and made three guides . \ 
The goddam cruise ships pools are filled with salt water O.O \ 
I'm in the airport ATM , Florida's Ft Lauderdale airport has FWEE WIFI ! 
NEED HUGGZZZZZZ !!!! \ 
pant pant * faints * 
is lonely . As always . 
Here I am peacefully typing and suddenly a massive spider walks across the air in front of my face and stops when it hits my fan . SHIT . It was WALKING ON AIR , RIGHT SIDE UP ! 
Is particularly depressed because nobody likes anything he likes and almost nobody likes him . Even considering friends he's the last one they'd call when bored . Nobodys ever called me for no reason . And don't take this as a queue to start . 
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength , while loving someone deeply gives you courage . \ 
-Lao Tzu\ 
Ooh I need Strength and courage ! 
My mom and me\ 
< PROPMALE > GET OUT OF YOUR ROOM . FROM NOW ON YOU HAVE NO COMPUTER . IF YOU HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK YOU GO TO TE LIBRARY . \ 
Ok \ 
Bla bla bla\ 
Later\ 
SO WHO WERE YOU PLAYING WITH ? \ 
Nobody\ 
SO YOU WERE PLAYING ALPNE , RIGHT ? BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER STUYVESANT KIDS ARE STUDYING BUT YOURE NOT\ 
( no it just means they're playing on the Xbox)\ 
Ok 
Most people put up posters of things they like . I just use mine as targets :/ 
OMG IT'S A NEW SEASON OF CASTLE !!! \ 
Squeals in fangurly delight . \ 
\ 
< PROPMALE > ... You are not a transexual . Repeat . 
Strawberry icecream <3 \ 
My life is lonely . I need to find a person who would pick me to play with first . Because it's going to be impossible with my personality . Very few truly like my company on the inside , it's not hard to see through . But I have to , before everyone I think is my friend hates me too if they don't already . 
Look at mah profile info ^_^ I added my favorite quotes and stuff . \ 
Today in Stuy i saw a really awkward scene-This girl groped another girl who I assume was her friend ... That was just wrong 
Native american myths are so detailed , they're sick . The one I just read details how the creator designed dicks and vaginas ... And the last one described how men and women got together and figured out what sex is ... 
FK YOU NARUTO I'M TRYING TO DO MY HOMEWORK AND NOW I'M CRYING BECAUSE JIRAIYA IS DEAD NUUUUUUUUU 
NOO NOW ITACHI DIED AND I'M CRYING AGAIN 
If I look up < PROPFEMALE > not a single person comes up in my search :) 
OMG Killer < PROPFEMALE > is proceeding to annoy the CRAP outta me with his rapping . 
Still censors himself on facebook sometimes . < PROPFEMALE > immature . 
\How do you know when you're in love ? \ " \ 
Is sipping at his decaf caramel frappuccino 
I can't stop crying I'm just so pissed at my mom and stuff 
I\ 
should delete my facebook account . I mean , it's totally useless . It's \ 
not making me friends or helping my communication , nobody has ever \ 
posted on my wall of their own accord , and nobody I actually want to \ 
talk to is ever online or has any free time . Or would talk to me before\ 
others anyway . 
I have to travel the world and find just one person who\ 
would rather talk to me beyond anyone else . But that would be hopeless\ 
>.< Probably only 1% of humans would converse with me , and \ 
probably 0.0001% really share my interests . ( see previous part it was too long ) 
I really miss < PROPFEMALE > and Mariya . They were the only girls who were ever nice to me of their own accord . 
I am very sad . It's partially my life but it's mostly because of THE THING which we do not understand at this age . I honestly don't think I will be understood until we are all older and more thoughtful in certain aspects , but time crushes dreams and some dreams move like jello already . 
I hate how after whining about my social life for lifetimes I can still go up to the people I know and say \I love y'all\ " without any regrets >_<" 
5 days and counting . \ 
Don't ask , you'll understand when the counter stops . 
GOD\ 
it's cold in upstate New York . I'm at lake < PROPFIRST > . Technically we're \ 
in the Adirondacks and the mountains are pretty much rainbows of fall \ 
foliage . It's all very calming . \ 
6 days and counting 
I long for the day when < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > are no longer the only ones who have started a conversation with me casually , or at least tried . 
7 days and counting 
Everyperson has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . Iknow that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least foran hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still ... fighting it . 
Talking with < PROPFIRST > is so mentally calming . And it's a very enlightening experience . I feel comfortable telling him things I couldn't tell my father , but I feel like even he's not mature enough to handle it all and I'll just drive him away . I feel somewhat bad atm . 
Imagine vanilla and chocolate swirled ice cream . Now imagine it had a mint swirl too . :O \ 
11 days and counting :P 
I have decided against working my butt off making a costume that ~ 3 people will notice . I'd rather be me because it's much less stressful and because being a depressed party popper is relaxing . It's very fun to analyze conversations from the side . 
Is having an uber Naruto marathon\ 
And is dancing because Kakashi has arrived to pwnzor one of Pains bodies 
Are you serious ? Konoha just got utterly obliterated AGAIN ? 
I understand more and more of < PROPFIRST > Brown each year . 
PAIN ! HINATA IS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CIRCLE ! RUN !!!! 
12 days and counting . \ 
I love you everyone , never forget :'( 
I've got it ! I'm going to be Shino for Halloween . There's just this one problem I cant find my prescription sunglasses OR the proper black pants , both of which I know I have . 
Can't wait to get to play Starcraft 2 which he just got . \ 
Doesn't know why < PROPFIRST > is so nice despite < PROPMALE > being a jerk most of the time . \ 
15 days and counting . 
There aren't 10 people on Earth who have actually started a conversation with me . \ 
18 days and counting . 
My timer has thus ended at 19 days . 19 days in which nobody posted on my wall . 
True Love and Great Hatred are the ONLY things that can truly blind a person . 
< PROPFEMALE > Bernabe , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Duda , < PROPFIRST > Wang , < PROPFEMALE > Huang . \

Today as I went to piano class I saw < PROPFEMALE > Wong . Very confusing for inner me , believe me ^_^ . \ 
< Here comes the FOURTH train this one HAS to be an F ! > ... It was the fourth E train in a row , just my luck . Door opens and I see someone reading . < You gotta be kidding me , look at the way that hair frames the face ... and it's the gray backpack O_O OMG it's her > 
< But it's 6:30 don't be a retard > < It's called clubs > \ 
< I must be sure , but I don't want to be stuck on the E train and be \ 
late for class > \ 
Suddenly < PROPFEMALE > turns her head and sees me . < AUGH DAMMIT PSYCHIC \ 
NOW I KNOW YOU CAN'T HIDE IT ANYMORE > \Hi < PROPFEMALE >...\" \ 
Deep down inside my only true < PROPFEMALE > is to answer someones call for help . But none are ever sent to me \ 
Translation to english . I have heard the desirable words \Alan can you help me\ " like twice in my life . " 
My mom says she's going to let me use the computer for one hour a day and lock up all devices that can connect to the internet at all other times . \ 
I got this 3 hour long speech and I figure that to be honest , she is right in one subject . No girl would ever come to me and talk to me ( or any boy for that matter ) 
I thought really hard and came up with something very nice to add to my philosophy . A true friend is someone who will scold you about something that will not change their life . Thus a best friend is not always a true friend , and vice versa . 
Me : Dad , the only person in that show I'd remember is < PROPFIRST > Bovi . \ 
Later , thinking : < PROPFIRST > Bovi ? that can't be right 
I hate homework so badly . I hate math the most . I'm staring at a problem and I'm like WTF , this is impossible . My mom shows me and it seemed so simple , but I still don't finish it . I get so pissed and I tell myself the fact that 
it's 1 and I got 6 hours of sleep had something to do with it , but I just don't know what to believe anymore , and there's nobody to tell me which way to go . FML , world . I'm there for you , but , when I'm in need , I'm alone . 
has won every Starcraft multiplayer he's been in and is feeling pretty good . Newbies just don't get how to counter 4 cloaked banshees . BRING IN SOLDIERS BEFORE YOU SCAN RETARDS . If I keep doing this ima become the best banshee microer ever . 
Is now the happy owner of 2 more wiimotes AND a nerd LONGSTRIKE ( Omg it's bolt action it feels so cool ) 
my mom needs to SHUT THE FUCK UP 
The root cause of all my troubles :\ 
Me : Mommy , < PROPFIRST > has an airsoft gun now 0_0 \ 
Her : So ? What do you need that for ? \ 
Me : ( dammit what do I say ? )\ 
Her : THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO LIVE AT ARTHURS HOUSE IF HES SO RICH ? \ 
Me : ( fml -_-) 
For one thing I don't think Arthurs parents would adopt me if my parents were to die . I don't know them well enough and I feel the opposite is true . But then I'm pessimist ( more like bipolar ) enough to say anything . 
Another quote . \ 
Friends are there for the small things . \ 
Then siblings are there for all the big things . \ 
But a true friend is there for the big things . 
I have a horrible headache and I'm pissed beyond belief cuz i still have homework and stuff . GODAMMIT FML 
I have to change my profile picture . This is a bad time to be realizing this because my laptop w/convenient camera is away in < PROPFEMALE > :/ 
thinks that 2 replies on the wall of a guy in California he's never met is enough . No need to scare people Fly , lest it's bandage time . 
My mom gave me am hour long speech which started because I accidentally said \it's because nobody wants to talk to me . \ " \ 
Yay I have a much cooler profile pic which I will either keep or probably make a collage once I get a 4th main champ -_-
