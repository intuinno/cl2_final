A lifetime of happiness ! No man alive could bear it : it would be hell on\ 
earth . 
I think im going crazy with happiness like i just enjoy every day now :) , thank you < PROPFEMALE > walls <3 
im preety sure im just insane .... 
Very despondant :( .... 
When you think of the long and gloomy history of man , you will find more\ 
hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have \ 
ever been committed in the name of rebellion . 
Most people would rather be certain they're miserable than risk being \ 
happy 
I hate that sick feeling you get when you cant \ 
stop thinking about someone ... 
Those who criticize our generation forget who raised it ... 
The best things in life are not things ... 
It always takes that one person to relveil us to oursevles and make us change , in my case i have many .... but one who i WANT to change for ! 
If all the world's a stage , I want to operate the trap door .... 
Tired ....

\I'm really to young to be feeling this old \"" 
like this if you think i look like a lost Beatles member ... cause apparently i do ? =/ 
you do you , i do me , and thats the real only way to see , what we can ever possibly be 
The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it . 
Everything has its beauty but not everyone sees it . 
DO you know whats hardcore !!?? 
I hope that while so many people are out smelling the flowers , someone is taking the time to plant some . 
funeral ... 
the death of an old man is not a tragedy , forgive him his shortcomings , and thank him for all his love and care 
\im just livin ' my life theres nothing crazy bout mee \"" 
Don't go out there and lose yourself in the world , cause you have more to offer then all the shit heads in it , cause if every ones sooo different then why do ppl conform to anyone ? 
peace 
Its not a question but a lesson learned in time 
i wanna skate tomm so whoever feels up hit me up on here or my phone , < PROPFIRST > on my < PROPFEMALE > 
a person's life isn't measured by the things they have , but by the things they do

Life is an unbroken succession of false situations 
< PROPMALE > Milk , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jr. And < PROPFIRST > Lennon weren't killed for what they had done but what they had stood for

When your world start's crashing down uncontrolably , the best thing you can do is smile 
I like the weather 
Blessed are the forgetful : for they get the better even of their blunders . 
the war on terror is a war on peace 
i cant stand sundays .... nothing good 
The right word may be effective , but no word was ever as effective as a rightly timed pause . 
I'm like < PROPMALE>'s friend Skeeter whenever I meet her . \

Casue I skeet her so hard people call her < PROPFEMALE > Mayonnaise 
two months countdown starts now ... peace till then ... oh and today was the best .

If we could live forever then there would be no point in living 
You have your way . I have my way . As for the right \ 
way , the correct way , and the only way , it does not exist . \ " , 2010-11-13 22:43:04 " 
Madness is rare in individuals - but in groups , parties , nations , and ages it is the rule 
By daily dying I have come to be .... 
we may never know what will be the results of our actions , but if we do nothing there will be no results . 
< PROPFEMALE > came to a fork in the road . \Which road do I take ? \ " she asked . \ 
i hate these gray days ... 
Ambivalence\ 
is the corner stone of curiosity , which is a stepping stone in the \ 
decisive judgment of options , which inevitably leads to a choice we \ 
make , now this being a repeating process , is it not safe to say that an \ 
ignorant man who lacks the the curious mind makes repetitive \ 
choices , whether they be right or wrong ? 
The means to real peace . —the reasons we give for requiring an army imply that our neighbor , who \ 
denies the < PROPFEMALE > for conquest just as much as does our own state , and \ 
who , for his part , also keeps an army only for reasons of self-defense , \ 
is a hypocrite ... -Nietzsche 
wtf 
one tolerates everyone else only as a means to his end , or not at all .... 
Bored as hell ... phone got blocked , so i cant call or txt and i cant receive anything either so ... shit :/ ...

Two roads diverged in a wood , and I-\ 
I took the one less traveled by , \ 
And that has made all the difference . 
Its only after we've lost everything , that we're free to do anything .

In the words of < PROPFIRST > reynolds , you dont know what ya got until you have options 
To observe attentively is to remember distinctly . 
How happy is the blameless vestal's lot ! The world forgeting , by the world forgot . Eternal shunshine of the spotless mind ! Each pray'r excepted and each wish resign'd

I'm sick of following my dreams . I'm just going to ask them where they're going and hook up with them later . 
The most violent element of society is ignorance . 
Everything you can imagine is real . 
If i see a light flashing could this mean that im coming home ?, if i see a line waving does this mean im not alone

Thoughts are the pre-curser of change 
The only currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when your uncool . 
Its nice to know that when everything seems to be falling down , that the world is still spinning round 
If you haven't found something strange during the day , it hasn't been much of a day . 
Everyone thinks of changing the world , but no one thinks of changing himself . 
Idealism is what precedes experience ; cynicism is what follows 
Life goes on long after the thrill of livin it's gone
