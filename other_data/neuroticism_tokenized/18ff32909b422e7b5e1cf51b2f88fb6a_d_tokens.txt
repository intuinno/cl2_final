what the fuck happened last night .... 

when you look at me i want to be , everything you want to see , i come to you now , defenses down , defensless now . 
you're just a trend , a lamb in sheep's clothing , time to strike the nerve and erase , we are standing right here and we'll stand here forever , you can't destroy what you can not replace 
ipod fuckin broke , slowly losing my sanity 
i no longer admire you , the way you burned them all alive , the fire in your eye , i'll always remember how fast the beautiful will fall , it all comes crashing down . i no longer admire you , sister , sister charlatan 
you are no god to me , this is a reckoning , you are nothing to me , this is the reckoning , and I will be there to see you fall , you are no god to me , there is the reckoning 
theres no question , your the answer , i will find you 
ahh fuck 
c'mon , c'mon we'll make it through this , open your eyes and see that we are half way home , were going home . 
what's taken away is the price they pay , for goodness sake let it fade away . let go of the past that tore you apart , embrace this < PROPMALE > for a brand new start . we weren't meant to be one of them , but to live life , love and give . they can't fool us anymore 
we've waited far to long to watch it all crash and fall through , so when you feel like shit you gotta keep on pushin , if you saw the world through my eyes , then you wouldn't feel so alright , its time to take our < PROPMALE > , you gotta sit back and hold tight . 
you're wasting my time while they're wasting away , you'll never , you'll never save me , you've dropped every line but they don't mean a thing , you'll never , you'll never save me . 
let's all think back on what brought us here , this is my grasp on what is real , don't tell me how i feel , with all that's passed i can't relate with myself from day to day , why does everything seem so far away to me 
wont be back for 2 more fucking weeks 
forever your eyes will hold the memory i saw your heart as it overtook me we tried so hard to understand and reason but in that one moment i gave my heart away that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me and all i knew was what had overtaken me with n 
my knuckles have turned to white , there's no turning back tonight , kiss me one last time 
mr. highway is thinking about the end 
isnt gonna be back until the 31st , big fucking surprise 
there must be serenity , there must be deliverance , deeper im falling , blindly descending 
god damnit 
so this beautiful dream has become a never ending nightmare , a stranger haunts us in our sleep , we're terrified , we're terrified . you're the only one who knows this and I hope you die with this on your lips . 
is just a ghost 
now i can sense your stale fear in the air as humanity starved for your flesh , your skin starts to rust beginning to crack , no one cares anymore , your false pretense is startling to fade and burn with your self-righteous , oh how hard the pitiful will fall 
is finally fucking home 
you know that i try to do the best i can , but you don't care and i swear , i swear i'll never be like you and that's the truth , cause i can see that you are playing hide and seek with all my dreams 
for once , lets leave the dreaming to someone else , our time has slipped away , we’re sinking faster , faster , no more play , get ready for the catch , i'm at the next step , waiting for our year 
even when I fall , will you still believe ? even when I'm lost will you still believe ? now I don't have much , will you save me ? but I'll give it all , will you save me ? 
head is killing me , feel like complete shit overall 
yay penis is the best ! 
ok < PROPMALE > is definitely a mega piece of shit 
as i run from all that’s left , i can feel i’ve reached the end , as my feet sink into the floor , my arms won’t fail me now , and my tongue won’t taste the sand , the winds won’t hold me down , i will stay alive , now we are reaching the end . 
< PROPFEMALE > garden dude 
dont shake , i hate to see you tremble 
ya want some za .... BRUH ?! 
i should've known the tides are getting higher , we can still survive , they think we're drowning but our heads are still above the waves 
this bridge was burnt before you could cross , you reap the benefits of what's lost . go home son , < PROPFEMALE > your costume up , a goddamn insult to the rest of us . a thousand-yard stare across the south , a full belly and a lying mouth , momma's boy plays heretic . the real thing would kill you quick . 
i know i've got you right where i want you , spininng around , falling down , there's nothing left of you 
revive a sense of hope amid these abandoned dreams , rewrite what it is to feel , in hopes it will < PROPFEMALE > me home 
so hold your head up high and know , it's not the end of the road , walk down this beaten path before you pack your things and head home , at the end of the road you'll find what you've been longing for , i know cause my feet have scars to show , i was lost with vague direction and no place to call home 
even when I fall , will you still believe ? even when I'm lost , will you still believe ? now I don't have much , but I'll give it all , will you save me ? 
breathe slowly , inhale exhale , a path I've already walked , but I just can't stop , it's too familiar , this same routine , as I live day by day , it slowly eats at me , my bones and my tongue ache from my failed attempts to make some sense of why I won't let you out of my sight 
what's taken away is the price they pay , for goodness sake let it fade away , let go of the past , that tore you apart . embrace this < PROPMALE > for a brand new start . 
you say you need a greater purpose , i say you need to see what’s coming , when you know that the feeling is gone , you’ll see this through my eyes and feel alive again . 
rescue me , take this hand , by myself , alone I stand , rescue me , from this world , from myself , before I grow old , someone rescue me 
you say everything comes if you don't turn your back , and i wait everyday , sometimes this < PROPFEMALE > i lack because it's just more of the same , more of the same and I just need you to remember my name , more of the same , more of the same and i just need you . 
you know that i try to do the best i can , but you don't care and i swear , i swear i'll never be like you and that's the truth cause i can see that you are playing hide and seek with all my dreams 
somethings getting in the way , somethings just about to break , i will try to find my place in the diary of < PROPFEMALE > , as i burn another < PROPFEMALE > , as i look the other way , i still try to find my place in the diary of < PROPFEMALE > , so tell me how it should be 
dear agony , just let go of me , suffer slowly , is this the way its got to be ? dont bury me faceless enemy , im so sorry , is this the way its gotta be ? 
chillin at The Garage with Shot Memory , yup 
run , run , run until you have to crawl , crawl , crawl until your hands bleed , bleed , bleed and then you will be safe , safe , safe and then you will be safe 
fucked shit up on new years , happy 2011 
and you neglected i called you out , don't please , i said we're stronger than this now , you resurrected mistakes , years past it seemed and they exist to still haunt you , and still you feel like the loneliness its better replaced by this , i don't believe it this way , and I can see the fear in your eyes , i've seen it materialize , growing stronger each day 
the sky weeps tonight , our bodies washed away , i am waiting for you , deliverance , the sun falls through the clouds , hear my cry 
bomb ass homemade tacos + a shitty drink of gin , sprite and sugar = one hell of a good night 
i know one day , all our scars will disappear , like the stars at < PROPFEMALE > , and all of our pain will fade away when morning comes , and on that day when we look backwards we will see , that everything is changed and all of our trials will be as milestones on the way 
brotercycle : a motorcycle with the side car thingy 
i am not afraid to fall asleep , i am not afraid to die , as long as we stand aside , we can make it through . stand up and fight against all demons if we stand up and fight all the wrongness in this world 
your house of lies will burn quickly and scatter the ashes of you and soon they’ll all know the story , soon they’ll all know the truth 
ink : such a great movie , just so much symbolism 
shame you say you're ready to die and nothing's left inside , i'll show you faith , it's not a wrong or a right , it's just a choice in your life , i'll show you how it feels , how it feels . 
lately I've been feeling a light , alive at last , my eyes have been opened and I can see the path ahead . tear down the walls thats been made around you , escape to see , its what you've been waiting for . I can see my world , pull yourself up 
were sleepwalking on our way to contentment 
< PROPMALE > is so cool 
a man who thirsts cannot expect to find a well and drink till quenched , for tragic spans may take his breath before he reaches journey's end , but in his heart he always knew that somewhere waters rest . a lover's heart may not suppose that he will win the one he chose , for < PROPMALE > heart and token's < PROPFEMALE > may never stir her love to grow , but unrequited hearts believe that love will find them yet 
remember all the fires we started , our aspirations for progression , we feed the burning for a better day , don't let your selfishness\ 
extinguish the flame 
i <3 lil < PROPMALE > 
fight with pride and fight to the end , strike on , this is your < PROPMALE > , make it worth your life 
as I run from all that’s left , I can feel I’ve reached the end , as my feet sink into the floor , my arms won’t fail me now , and my tongue won’t taste the sand , the winds won’t hold me down , I will stay alive , now we are reaching the end . 
woke up to a brand new skyline , we licked our wounds and mourn the dead , swallow the story hook and sinker , is that what we meant when we said that we never would forget ? 
since when did you become so cold and such a life-less piece of work ? I can't take the sound of you anymore or the thought of you . 
got a new phone , so you should comment your < PROPFIRST > or something 
heavy words surround me 
sticks and stones wont break my bones , its the boulders i shoulder 
stand beside me , let me see what it tastes like , dont be scared about me , i am here just to see you die 
so you tried to put a fire out , but you used gasoline , and the when the congregation gathered round , your screaming it wasnt me 
im a mountain that has been moved , im a river that is all dried up , im an ocean nothing floats on , im a sky that nothing wants to float in , im a sun that doesnt burn hot , im a < PROPFEMALE > that never shows its face , im a mouth that doesnt smile , im a word that no one really wants to say 
your house of lies will burn quickly , and scatter the ashes of you , soon they'll all know the story , soon they'll all know the truth 
keep moving on , keep dreaming on 
im calling last call , you're so intoxicating , lies and deceit used like a fist of cowardice , cornered and battered , you'll burn every bridge before too long while your self respect is gone 
oh how I've been teething in light of your misleading , you've caused this collapse between the heart and the synapse . 
and i cant tell if you laughing , between each smile theres a tear in your eye , theres a train leaving town in an hour , its not waiting for you , and neither am i 
i am not the weak willed , nor am i a fool who cannot see , i am not the weak willed , i will not let pride destroy me 
stick to the side roads , they have interesting thoughts 
take me away , away from this place , come like a thief in the night , be a rapture and take me away from these sentiments turned sediment , from this crude cast of our intent , from the boulder we can't set aside , come like a thief in the night , be my vision and take me away 
you cant destroy what you can not replace 
show me your hands , let me wash them clean , show me your heart and let me heal you . 
even when I fall will you still believe ? even when I'm lost will you still believe ? now I don't have much , will you save me ? but I'll give it all , will you save me ? 
from yesterday its coming , from yesterday the fear , from yesterday it calls him , but he doesnt want to read the message here 
what we see now , is only a fraction 
now we're running to find meaning , we're gone and we're never coming back . 
come on come on we'll make it through this , open your eyes and see that we are halfway home , were goin home 
when we find truth inside ourselves , it's hard not to run away , but we must capture and embrace , it's how we truly live our lives 
still drunk 
and everything I had , now is nothing but a dream , and all my thoughts go straight to northeast lights 
so get on your feet wipe the dirt off and get with it , < PROPFEMALE > waits at your door , you move on because the past can't be your passion , so what if you did something wrong , find someone who hasn't . 
determination , perseverance , resolution ... resurrection . 
your just a symphony of violins that dont make a sound . 
as the light breaks through with the hope that we had , my eyes burn at my face as the portrait's displayed . 
I should of known the tides are getting higher , we can still survive , they think we're drowning but our heads are still above the waves 
sticks and stones wont break my bones , its the branches and boulders i shoulder 
ugh ... 
and now I'm standing here alone , still I hold my head up high , the time has come for me to leave , it's the only way to survive . 
i had a feeling this lie would go insane , i should stab this vengeance through your name 
I am the monster you created , and like a mountain we look down on kings , \ 
\ 
you reside in me , my thoughts and my dreams won't die . 
drowning in my sleep , im drowning in my sleep 
< PROPFEMALE > Djuna Schleif is soooooo cool . 
thanks for the bday wishes guys ! now lets get drunk 
let come what may come and let go of what goes , the wind's gonna blow where the wind's gonna blow , we'll never know why it flows where it flows , let come what may come and let go of what goes . 
fuck flat tires ! 
It's okay to feel lost , it just means you're alive , I've told myself a thousand times , \ 
from the ashes we will rise . 
it was a free fall , an act of desperation , our backs against the wall , it was a free fall , it was an act of desperation , down we go , as we lined up at the edge , we were open wide , like fools waiting for a sign 
great day , signed up for classes , adventure in downtown , shoveled and now a little r and r with my homie vodka 
I shot the maid , what can I say ? I shot the maid , it was an accident . 
the heart is something you can't control , we either choose to follow or be left on our own , so we're leaving here on a less traveled road , as desperate cries grow louder , I know we're getting close , getting close 
come to my senses , give up all paste tenses , because if I stay in the past , I just won't last 
I bear witness to an ugly reality , I won't blink for the pure satisfaction as beauty fights with perfection , tape my eyes open for the oncoming storm , now I can sense your stale fear in the air as humanity starved for your flesh , your skin starts to rust beginning to crack , no one cares anymore , your false pretense is startling to fade and burn with your self-righteous , oh how hard the pitiful will fall 
Hey dudes are you ready to understand why some of your friends are true , these ones that would follow you anywhere and through anything you’d do , revelation of a friendship on your tattoos , a salvation . 
oilhflkhjflakjfglasjkdr 
for we are nothing without brotherhood and brotherhood is nothing without your brothers 
So hold your head up high , and show yourself what it means to be alive , show yourself what it truly means not to be alone . 
fire alarms are stressful 
fuck the packers !!! 
chillin with < PROPFIRST > at the tobacco shop 
for you , for us , I will rise before we die . for you , for us , I will fight to be satisfied .
