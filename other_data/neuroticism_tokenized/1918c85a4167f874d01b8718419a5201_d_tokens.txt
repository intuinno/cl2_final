( UrbanDictionary.com ) < PROPFEMALE > - A women named < PROPFEMALE > is typically very beautiful with an incredible body and nice eyes . They are known to be very loveable . < PROPFEMALE > s are envied by other women . 1 . Damnnn , < PROPFEMALE>'s lookin ' fine today , as usual . 2 . I wish I was < PROPFEMALE > , shes so pretty and nice ! 
On Urbandictionary.com ' < PROPFEMALE>' has 2 awesome meanings .. 1 . Its a powder form of ecstacy 2 . A beautiful person who all the guys want to sleep with . She is really sweet but drinks a lot . This suits me better than the meaning of < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I REALLY fn hate some dog hair .. omg !

I'm just gonna stop being nice and caring about people ... because its whatever !! 
Even with 4wd , we're stuck ... i'm tired of this damn snow ..

Don't care how many times i see it , < PROPMALE > Gump always makes me cry . 
So ok ... its most definitely a fashion NO NO to wear red lipstick and pink eyeshadow together on the same face all at once .. am i right , or am i right ?? I know im right ... thats just a big ' ol mess ... geez . 
Leaves are falling all around , It's time I was on my way . Thanks to you , I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay . But now it's time for me to go . The autumn < PROPFEMALE > lights my way . For now I smell the rain , and with it pain , and it's headed my way . Sometimes I grow so tired , but I know I've got one thing I got to do . I'm Gonna Ramble on :) 
And yesterday I saw you kissing < PROPFEMALE > flowers , But all that lives is born to die . And so I say to you that nothing really matters , And all you do is stand and cry . I don't know what to say about it , When all you ears have turned away , But now's the time to look and look again at what you see , Is that the way it ought to stay ? 
I had the most bittersweet dream this morning .. I was at a party with friends and all of a sudden everyone was heading out to go see Led Zeppelin , I was ready in 1.5 seconds and rushing everyone else out or i was sooo going to leave them .. which i did ;) Dont get in the way of me and LED ZEP lol . Best dream ive had in forever that i actually remember though i never actually saw them in the dream it was still great

To all my friends that send event invites ... STOP sending me invites to pizza , wings and things ... screw that place . 
These are the seasons of emotion and like the wind they rise and fall , this is a wonder of devotion , i see the torch we all must hold , this is a mystery of a quotient , upon us all a little rain must fall . Zep <3 
Is it wrong to be more into the imagination movers than my son is ? lol . probably so .. 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding herof how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY , there's a man stealing smiles from her .. Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence ? 
Thinks people ... especially GROWN people should refrain from being a crybaby . It's just not necessary .. GET OVER YOURSELF ... good god man ! Jealousy can kill ya ;) 
cannot express how thankful she is right now 
I should REALLY go to bed ... 
I want some japanese food !!!

There was a boy \ 
A very strange enchanted boy \ 
They say he wandered very far , very far \ 
Over land and sea \ 
A little shy and sad of eye \ 
But very wise was he \ 
And then one day \ 
A magic day he came my way \ 
And while we spoke of many things \ 
Fools and kings \ 
This he said to me \ 
\The greatest thing you'll ever learn \ 
Gosh , I never knew I would wake up to such amusement this morning , thanks FB :D 
So fuck this weather ... i mean really , it always happens on a night I have plans 
Dear snow , \ 
I HATE YOU ! \ 
<3 < PROPFEMALE > 
Its such a shame that grown people cant mind their own business .. Just lovin the world we live in and all the stupid people that inhabit it . 
Ready to do some retail therapy to heal the shitty night I had and party with my bitches tonight ! <3 
And if I have to follow it will change the way he is\ 
And with me his sovereignty can be lost by what I give\ 
And if he mentions leaving I can do no more\ 
To make him stay behind an open door\ 
The love that he loses he will find again another way\ 
And I won't be the one to tell him where he must play 
Cant believe Ive been driving around with expired tags since friggin October and the new ones were in my glove box the WHOLE TIME ! Cannot believe I never got pulled for that ! Super lucky ! 
Don't ask me nothin about nothin , cause I just might tell ya the truth\
