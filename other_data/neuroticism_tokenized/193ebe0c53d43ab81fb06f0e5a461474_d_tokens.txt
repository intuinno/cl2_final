< PROPFEMALE > I was watching the news and it gave me a chuckle ... Apparently someone reported a Vampire sighting and called it in .. I'm not sure which is worse ... The lady crediting it as true vampire or the reporters crediting it as a true story . Needless to say I changed the channel . Bite me ;) 
\People are tenacious when it comes to the treasure of thier imaginary independence(from God ) . They hoard and hold their sickness with a firm grip . They find their identity and worth in their brokenness and gaurd it with every ounce of strength they have . No wonder grace has such little attraction . In that sense you have tried to lock the door of your heart from the inside . \ " The Shack <3 <3 "

If Direct TV gave the majority of profits from the NFL Sunday Ticket for national debt , not only would we be WAY better off but also I could say I had a hand in it while receiving quality television . Who's to say that after gaining the funds , the government wouldn't spend it on some ridiculous venture I don't support thus furthering our depression , SO I don't blame you Direct TV , But I will buy your programming .

\ I wanted to run away that day .... but you can't run away from your own feet ... \ " Cloudy With A < PROPMALE > Of Meatballs ... <3<3 " 
Trying to enjoy this most beautiful day and wonderful scenery outside before the bitter cold sets in and you will barely be able to see me beneath the layers of hoodies and scarves .

Happy to be an American and Blessed to be alive now in this time . Sometimes we lose sight of all we have and how far we have come . People like all of us fought and are fighting to uphold the idea of something better . Today specifically and everyday we should remind ourselves of our pregression and not all about our recession . Happy VdAY . <3 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes ... means a ton . Much Love <3 
Sadness .. My besties are leaving tomorrow but for the best possible of reasons . Moving , even multiple times in search of a betterness and rightness of thier worlds is far more rewarding in the end than staying stagnent and doing nothing . It's not our plan anyway . We must strive to see what he's trying to show us daily , within us and for our lives . I will miss them more than they know . My heart is with them always . <3

God is showing me things I needed to see ... But somehow already knew . Every action clears that vision . My eyes are open again . A good heart has no hate or vengance . It releases it God , I release it . I am changed . My path is clear . My heart has peace . God is good . <3<3 \

Annoyance : I spent a crap ton of time on my questions for Intro 2 Business so they sound good & detailed .. during Christmas .. Turns out I don't have to turn them in at all . Apparently they're just for reference , I only had to take the test which took like 5 < PROPFEMALE > . I feel somewhat mentally challenged . Newbie hazing of sorts , Or an attention to detail kick n the pants ! Although , seems the class is going to go by fast now :/ 
You do not need to leave your room . Remain sitting at your table and listen . Do not even listen , simply wait , be quiet still and solitary . The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked , it has no choice , it will roll in ecstasy at your feet . \
