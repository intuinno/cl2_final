There's a difference between me not wanting to speak up cuz it's not my business to stick my nose into drama that doesn't concern me and me speaking up cuz u piss me off from fucking me over so much . I'm the type of person who turns the other cheek . But if u can't take the blame for once and continue to fuck me over even after talking , then i will gladly fight fire w/ fire cuz i will definitely fuck u over for good 
i like it on the table , the chair , the floor , and on the bed ; 9

The girl you just called fat ? She's been starving herself & lost over 30lbs . The boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability and studies over 4 hours every night . The girl you just called ugly ? Spends hours putting make up on just so people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He's abused enough at home . There's more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying . 
who's in sd for spring break ???
