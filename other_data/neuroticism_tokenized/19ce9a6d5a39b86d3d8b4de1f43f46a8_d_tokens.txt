Well I have a week to learn a monologue . I will be ready ! 
I need basketball !!! 
I can't wait for school :) I can't believe I just said that !!! 
On FB with my new LAPTOP !!!! 
It was a wicked and wild wind that blew down the doors to let me in , shattered windows and the sound of drums , no could believe what I'd become ! 
Grand parents in town , bowling tomorrow , audition Thursday , and lock-in Friday . I am busy school must be coming ! 
At home , laughing at my dad coaching < PROPFEMALE > through tic-tac-toe . Life gets no better . Haha 
Audition DONE WHOO ! Lockin tomorrow !!! 
Nothing more to do for awhile . Got Drama Thursday ! Can't wait to see everyone ! 
The Knights start practice soon ! I look forward to having a life again ! 
FB is creepin me out they know a ton about what I like which scares me cause I don't tell them any thing ! 
Drama tomorrow , basketball practice sometime in the near future , and then the homelink open house ! Summer is over ! ( YES ! No more boredom ! ) 
I love this pic ! \ 
<<<<<<<< 
Drama ! So pumped !!! 
Basketball camp tonight with < PROPMALE > Yarbrough !!! So ready !!!! 
Well it seems my friend < PROPMALE > Yarbrough is thinks he is going to beat me one on one , like the last time he is sorly mistaken ! Just letting him know 2 things , 1 we play keeps and 2 that he gets ball first and he better score cause I plan to take that ball !!!!! 
I am sad to say that my goodreads account is having problems so I am going to write my review of Do Hard Things on FB first . The book was incredible ! The authors not only used there own experience but other kids THEY inspired ! They also talk about the fact that the word teen is part of the problem and how most think it is the time to party . I highly recommend it to all , but even more so to teens . The book gets 5 of 5 ! 
Tried to fill out the application to get an account with the Rebelution.com forum . It is annoying they ask for 100 words about what it is all about , and then 150 about contributing . UGGG 
A friend of ours from the library sent Nevin a free pass to see the screening of Easy A . Wow ... just wow . 
Iron Maiden's new album is out ! 
He gave his life for us he fell upon the cross\ 
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss\ 
It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again\ 
Tell me why , tell me why 
Going to the Cards-Padres game ! 
I am going to basketball practice today ! 
Boomer Sooner !!!! 
As I wait for the start of basketball I think about the Knights as a whole , and I feel disrespected as a team . We have been counted out by every homeschool basketball fan besides our own ! I say we shock them , I say we win big ! And lets beat the Patriots when the time comes !!!! 
Nearly died making popcorn . I do not like Mondays . 
On my way to Yo Shrader's bday party ! 
Sooners 28 Longhorns 20 ! Nebraska watch out , the Sooners will see you in < PROPFIRST > ! 
Steelers 14 Ravens 17 :( 
Some ppl can be very rude . 
I have seen a video so evil it is not funny ! The green movement thinks so though and it is disgusting ! They want people like me and others do not like or agree with the green movement gone ! They expressed this with a video of school children that do not agree with them being blown up it was graphic and evil ! 
I just saw the trailer for the Voyage of the < PROPFEMALE > Shredder I think they changed the entire quest behind the story ! That is not right ! 
What is the big deal bout 10/10/10 ??? 
Well somehow Oklahoma is #1 ! I have no idea how they jumped Oregon but the computers said they did . 
Well I had a productive day Spanish in the morning , finished a essay on nuclear power , then went to basketball practice . The fun happened at home when I had to squeeze through an 11 inch window in our door to get the key . Fun . 
Mizzou really thinks they are going to win !!! HAHAHA as if ! You can't make a comeback against San < PROPMALE > St and expect to beat Oklahoma !!! BOOMER SOONER !!! 
I got a sledge hammer !!!! 
OU 21 Mizzou 20 in the 4th BOOMER SOONER !!!

For those of you who do not know the picture on the top of my profile is what I was tag on by < PROPFEMALE > Pratt I must say it is pretty funny though ! 
Seahawks are up 31-20 over the Saints ! 
I lay down , but sleep does not take me . I am still moving . Fast and silent . My mind will not let my body know rest . My body fights with my mind a battle that it will not win easily . Let me sleep and let me be at peace for at least a little while ! 
Steelers are back !!!! 
Steelers won !!!! AFC beware the defense is out for blood !!! 
Haha Steelers highest seed left Jets will make the trip to Heinz Field ! The Terrible Towels well fly and emotions run high when the Steelers beat them and make a trip to < PROPFIRST > !

Got crushed . 
Tell tale of the men\ 
All dressed in black\ 
That most of them\ 
Not coming back\ 
Sent off to the war\ 
To play little games\ 
And on their return\ 
Can't name no names\ 
Some strange yellow gas\ 
Has played with their minds\ 
Has reddened their eyes\ 
Removed all the lies\ 
And strange as it sounds\ 
Death knows no bounds\ 
How many get well\ 
Only time will tell 
I need to read stuff more carefully . 
Ok I have seen the creepiest X-files episode so far ! Insane people with some basic psychic powers is just a frightening combo ! 
This is interesting Valentines day on the news feeds go one of two ways . The one is that of happy valentines day love you all type statuses . On the other hand we have the people who are not fans of the holiday hahaha it is always interesting to see them right next to each other on my news feed .
