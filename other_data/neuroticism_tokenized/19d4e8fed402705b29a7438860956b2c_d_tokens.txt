???????????????? \ 
Happy New Year everyone ! 

Like fingerprints , everyone's tongue print is different ! 
has just added every episode and movie of Pokemon to her download queue . 
Started my QA tester job tonight . My Hours are 15:00 to midnight , Monday through Friday . So far ( one nights work ) it actually seems pretty fun . There's only six of us in the night crew so it's real easy to get along and the pay is definately worth the stress level . My rating : Better than expected . It'll do until I can find someone to pay me for making the games instead of breaking them . 
forgot how much work a full-time job is . Where has all my personal time gone ? 
currently has 69 friends . Is this hawt ? 
Uh ... what ? I lost a friend . I dunno who . Guess I'm not a cool kid . 
is updating her Facebook status . 
is finally making head way on her game but it's already slowing down . Testing for pixel collision makes my computer a sad panda . 
They smirk at your hairstyle and sleep with your wife . \ 
Dressed in black jackets and horrible shoes , \ 
Getting divorces and turning to booze . \ 
Forcing old ladies to throw them some bread . \ 
Who could deny they'd be better off dead ? \ 
Look closer and you may recoil in surprise , \ 
At web-footed fascists with mad little eyes . \ 
Ducks , Ducks ! Quack , Quack ! Quack , Quack ! 
Everyone thinks they're such sweet little things\ 
Soft downy feathers and nice little wings\ 
But there's a poison I'd like to administer , \ 
You think they're cuddly but I think they're sinister . \ 
What are they doing at night in the park ? \ 
Think of them waddling about in the dark . \ 
Sneering and whispering and stealing your cars , \ 
Reading pornography , smoking cigars . \ 
Nasty and small undeserving of life . 
is really getting affected by this weather . Whenever I drive I can feel my tires slipping on the road and I'm getting flashes of previous misfortune that I haven't been getting for over a year . Why is the sky still making wet ? T_T 
wants to sleep all day . 
is eating Swedish Fish and playing video games . 
is having trouble keeping up with her Hulu subscriptions . Also , what the butt is with the new YouTube layout ? Can I change it back ? It's messed on my desktop but fine on my lappy . 
likes hearing friends ' middle names . Tell me yours and you get ... uh ... a response ? 
can't seem to watch an episode of Parenthood without breaking down in tears . 
is still keeping her record of crying every episode . 
wants to play mahjong . Someone play mahjong with her already . 
finally got around to getting some Owl City albums . Gotta let your inner 16-year-old girl loose some times , right ? 
On hot days , it has to be spicy curry ! \ 
\ 
Atatata ~ it burns ... 
New Burn Notice ? Don't mind if I do ! =D 
AHH !! Couldn't wait for the next episode of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime to release so I read the next part in the manga instead . Now I can't wait for the next chapter of the manga to release !! \ 
I'm in despair !! 
I think I want to cosplay the Kagamine twins . Everyone does it but meh . It'd be cute to go as a couple . 
Just watched the season finale of Glee . I don't think I've ever cried so much in a 40 minute interval than I have just now . Purely amazing . \ 
Who else loved this episode ~ no , this series ! 
was just rewatching an epic zombie movie . I wish I knew how it ended . I woke up before the end the other time I had this dream too . 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!! Screw the elite four !!! This is too stressful !!! AHHHHHHHHH !!! Why is hyper beam so broken !? 
You may swim like otters but your clan doesn't belong in this forest ! \ 
lololololol 
>> < PROPFIRST > and Jon\ 
Here's the plan . I've got some campaign stuff prepared . Waiting to hear from < PROPFIRST > to know if we have a full party . If all goes well , next Tuesday we start playing . First night will just be character creation and introduction to the campaign . The following Tuesday can be our first play session but after that I wanna only do two sessions a month so I have time to prepare . Thoughts ? 
just bought the materials for Leafeon cosplay . This is ganna be great . =D 
just chipped a tooth !! What do I do , what do I do !? T_T I've this little horseshoe shaped chip out of my front tooth !! 
Leafeon update ~ \ 
I may have to redo what I've done so far with the ears . I don't like how it's turning out . What are people opinions of being able to see thread seams on a costume ? I might try just doing an outer seam ( showing ) instead of the usual inside out thing to hide the seams . It will give me a sharper shape for the leaves that I like but I wanna know what people think of visible seams . 
Tooth is chipping worse . This means two things :\ 
1 . ) I get to eat nothing but soup for the next week . Lovely . \ 
2 . ) More importantly , I guess I'll be in < PROPFEMALE > again next week for the dentist . Anyone wanna do something before I come back to the cities ? 
So I was just wandering around on YouTube when I suddenly thought to myself , a Vocaloid remix of Tik Tok might be kinda cute since the lyrics are all autotuned anyways . Surprisingly I couldn't find many and the ones I found weren't any good . \ 
However I did find some adorable Kagamine < PROPMALE > + Rin videos to \Your Love is My Drug\ " that make me want to cosplay the twins with someone . " 
I just got a sudden and incurable craving for milkshake and index cards . I went to MD's and < PROPMALE > World and got what I needed . \ 
The point of this story however is that I just remembered how much I love idly driving around town at night . Nice post-storm air . 
Calling anyone in the twin cities area . We're in need of an additional player for D&D ( 3.5 ) . If you're interested , let me know . We play twice a month . 
I cook the weirdest food . I just sautéed up some onions with garlic salt and melt cheese over it and put it on toast . It's so good . 
YouTube's vuvuzela button amuses me to no end . 
I can't believe I haven't read much < PROPMALE > Potter fanfic/doujinshi until now . < PROPMALE > xDraco is so adorable . =3 
I've decided I will do some jogging each morning to stay fit . Today was the first day I managed to rip myself out of bed this early to actually do it though . I got maybe two blocks before I couldn't breathe and it felt like my heart was going to explode . I walked the rest of the mile ... Needless to say , I need to work on my stamina , huh ? I think I need to go throw up ... 
Today I took a different approach . I alternated walking and jogging a bit at a time . It felt a lot better . Not feeling dead or neusious this time , although I could feel the fatigue from yesterday creep into my legs as soon as I started power walking . I wanted to finish with some stretches when I get back around to the apartment building , but then I realized I don't know how to stretch . 
Last night in my dreams ~ myself , < PROPFEMALE > Goodwill , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Hammer , < PROPFIRST > Taubenheim , and < PROPFIRST > Engen were going to senior prom ? What about your dreams ? 
rates this performance one skinless donkey . 
Would someone kindly tell me why I just pulled some gray hair from the top of my head ... 
Running my AC over doubles my electricity < PROPMALE > ... how does it use more than my 3 computers ? 
has a sudden craving for pan . Anpan , karepan , melonpan ... 
forgot to put sunscreen on the top's of her feet before tubing . It hurts so much . Oh , my good friend aloe , how I love thee . 
Reason to Clear Out My Freezer More Often #357 \ 
I just found a stack of at least a hundred credit card receipts in a thin mints box in the back of my freezer . 
is painting some fives red — and only a handful of people know what that means . 
How did my 3rd and 4th toe fall asleep but the rest of my foot is fine ? 
This zoo will be a world famous zoo . 
Lol , facebook won't let me say I'm in an open relationship with Jesus . 
I told the lady in the rental office my AC isn't actually cooling the air before pumping it into my apartment and she < PROPMALE > up on me . 
LOL , harsh job application questions . Do you fake being polite ? Yes/No 
AHHHH !! Chiggers !! All over my leg ! So painful ! Exclamation point ! AHHH !! 
Just played a game of mahjong against atashi watashi to watakushi . I won . 
wants a Japanese style ofuro . 
Perkins ran out of English applications so I applied in Spanish . 
These highlights look awesome with my mostly earthy toned closet ! Love it ~ 
bought an anime body pillow today . I'm now officially an anime otaku . It was only a matter of time . 
Awesome mental image that only I can understand ! A lapian riding a cabybara ! =D 
Epic game of mahjong is epic . 
... So I'm cooking dinner . A fruit fly decided it smelt good and flew close enough to die from the heat of the stove . Smart . 
Dremt a cheesy horror movie in its entirety . I must say , they're a lot scarier when you're in them . It even did that mystery , \Is the monster really dead ? \ " thing at the end which scares me . And fighting off your own friends with broken pieces of a book shelf is not cool . Freaking weird dreams I get lately . " 
They just showed my apartment . I wonder if that old lady thinks I'm crazy with all these anime scrolls . Meh . 
I'M AWAKE !! I'M AWAKE !! 
11:54 ~ Lightning struck the ground seemingly inches from my window . Blinding and deafening . The fire alarms went off and I flipped . Meeting up with my evacuating neighbors I learned there was smoke on the 3rd floor , right above my apartment . Shit just got real . 
Focus on your long-term goal . \ 
Good things will soon happen . \

Went to the Ren Fair and didn't even get a turkey leg ! WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME !? 
So hard to wake up when the sky is this gray . 
T_T When did it become winter already ? I hate you Minnesota ! When I stay up all night I want to see the sunrise !! 
Totally just remembered raving to caramelldansen at geek . kon . Best room party at the con ! 
I can't open this jar of pickles !!! Gimme my yummies , stupid jar !! 
has never felt this before ... Hot tomato soup in the eye . Lovely . 
Cat Face , he's got the big cat face\ 
He's got the body of a cat , and the face of a cat , \ 
And he flies through the air cause ' he's got a cat face , \ 
CAT FACE ! 
I swear I can live on books alone . I haven't eaten since like .. that tomato soup the other night . 
Ew , it's October already ? I want summer back ...

A hippopotamus is a well ironed peanut shaped elephant . 
Kinda bored tonight . Spent a few hours cleaning up my empty apartment . Drank some rum and watched my shows . No one's online to chat . What's up with this . And it's still only 23:00 ? =.= Guess I'll work on my game . 
The apartment is clean . The keys have changed hands . I'm officially homeless ! \ 
While checking out the landlord told me some lovely horror stories about other tenants leaving their cleaning until far beyond a reasonable deadline and how they've seen dust so thick it was literally hanging over the tops of the cupboards like a snowdrift . 
Interblags on my desktop !? Why thankyuu ~ 
My god man ! Do they want tea ? 
So this is old news but anyone seen High School of the Dead ? Take your standard romantic drama anime and add one part rapid spreading zombie virus . Shit just got real . 
This is not your grandpa's oatmeal ! 
\It's dangerous . Don't use it while the wire still < PROPFEMALE > the electric . \ " \ 
updates with a witty status . Some people like it but not many comment . 
STOP STEALING MY CHIPS !! 
went bowling with the family . Broke 100 points and 3 nails ... It's hard to text when one thumbnail is 8mm shorter than the other . 
I've just surgically opened a cat to make it stop purring . WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE !? 
Sign of truly health nails ? My finger nail just got in a fight with the back board of my bed ... and won .

I don't want to work 9 hours on my birthday . =.= 
Looking for rum afterwork . Who's joining me ? 
My rum tastes like cupcakes ... awesome ! 
Well ... the festivities are over . I think it's time for bed before I have work in the morning . Gotta love that silly computer skill training . 
I think I fell asleep somewhere between equal rights act and disability act training . Then I skipped the training part and aced the next 3 quizzes . Can I deal with the annoying customers yet ? 
Tonight's dinner will be half-a-dozen cupcakes and a quart of chocolate milk . 
Copypasta ~ I want you to comment on this status about how you met me . But , I want you to lie . That's right . Just make stuff up . After you comment this copy it to your status so I can do the same . I know how many creative friends I have so come on . Make me laugh :) 
Out of town for the weekend . Text me ~ 
Naoto just trounced me in a game of majan . I am belittled by his superior discard reading skill . 
Considering I don't even like football and I showed up 20 minutes late , I think the $23 I won is pretty good . 
Yay !!!! Ayuzawa finally confessed and Usui asked her out !! Ahhhhh ~ ! <3<3 I could melt ~ 
Dear Asshole-in-the-Truck-Behind-Me , \ 
Please turn off your brights ; you're in the middle of town . Despite what you might think , your attempt to perform laser eye surgery through my rear view mirror is neither warranted nor effective . Please die in a fire after kindly dimming your head lights , you absurd prick . \
