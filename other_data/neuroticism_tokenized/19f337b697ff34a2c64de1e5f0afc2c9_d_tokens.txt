despises Kanye West ... but loves Beyoncé . =D 

How's the Verizon network been treating you two ( < PROPFEMALE > Renner and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Brunt) ? 
What's really funny about all that is that it seems there are a number of people who are wholeheartedly belief that BS ... Wow . 
still has no idea as to what he should get < PROPMALE > Kwiatkowski and SamanthaAnne VanBrunt for Christmas . 
sitting next the the coolest person i know KAITY LYONS :) 
kind of loves the pirate version of Facebook . =] 
had a lot of fun tonight . Thank you , < PROPFIRST > Gales , < PROPFEMALE > Thurlow , < PROPFEMALE > Humphrey , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stone , and < PROPFEMALE > Dobson ! =] 
loves how \organized\ " JCC's tornado warnings are . =p " 
pities the ignorant . 
loves the I Am T-Pain app for iPhone . =] 
... And I thought Croc shoes were bad . http://twitpic.com/1e481j 
is glad that he just bought a mysterious woman a < PROPFEMALE > bar ... 
is a bit disappointed that the only truly worthwhile feature of iPhone OS 4.0 won't be available to the 3G . =\\ 
believes that the human mind has a psychological need for drama ... Some get their fill from media while others get it from their lives . 
watched Avatar for the first time and absolutely loved it ! 
had a lot of fun on vacation . I'm in the car with < PROPFEMALE > Humphrey , < PROPFIRST > Gales , and < PROPFEMALE > Stone going to Applebee's for Humpy's birthday ! 
finds it ridiculous that people are making such a fuss over a mosque being placed several streets away from Ground Zero . 9/11 had nothing to do with Islam or religion in general . It was about hate . 
thinks that < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > is probably one of the better films of the series from an emotional standpoint , but the story itself is a real mess . They strayed way too far from the book . I'm so glad they're splitting the Deathly Hallows into two parts . 
thought < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Part 1 was brilliant and followed the book more faithfully than the previous installments ... But you definitely have to have read the books to understand everything . 
< PROPFIRST > is the most amazing person ever . =D 
had a lot of fun today thanks to < PROPFIRST > Gales ! =D 
had a delicious birthday dinner thanks to < PROPFIRST > Gales . =D 
Apparently my Twitter isn't updating my Facebook ... So time to post a bunch of random statuses . =p 
is dissapointed that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > allowed E.T. to be ruined by Kanye West . =\\ 
is really loving this warm weather ! =D 
I wish I was cool like < PROPFIRST > .
