As we come to Christ , claiming no merit of our own , but clinging by faith to His blood , we are justified . Our sins are blotted out , and we are clothed with the righteousness of Jesus . Obviously in our daily experience we fall short of the perfect righteousness God requires . But because He has imputed to us the righteousness of His Son , He now sees us as being just as righteous as Christ Himself . - < PROPFIRST > Bridges 
My older brother < PROPFIRST > Chouravong and pregnant sister-in-law < PROPFEMALE > Chouravong are leaving in a few hours . I would just like to thank them for taking the time and spending their money to come down to Texas while I was in < PROPFEMALE > . It meant so much to me . I love you three .

We were never meant to live a sinless life . We were meant to trust in Jesus Christ who lived a sinless life on our behalf . He has given us His sinless nature and is now working things - in , through and around us - for our good . 
My last True Love Talks newsletter is going out today ! Give me your email if you want to be put on the list . Crazy news of my new job , which country I'll be in , and my love life ( oh ! ) . 
Praise God for my new job as the Executive Director of Wise Choices For Youth , Inc ., an organization that helps teens realize the love of God in the areas of sex , dating and relationships . I ask for your prayers - particularly for vision , guidance , direction . Thank you soooooo much ! 
You are completely in right standing with God because of Jesus . You have died and been buried with Him . Since you're dead , you don't follow the law or break the law . You have no relationship to the law . You are married to another , Jesus Christ . You now live in a relationship , perfect union with Jesus Christ . Now you no longer live , but Christ lives in you . 
Please pray for us as we are going through a complete rebranding of Wise Choices For Youth , Inc . This includes a lot - new logo , font , colors , business cards , letterhead , website , Powerpoints , etc . Let me know if you are willing to help out ( especially if you are able to come into the office) ! Thanks ! 
Today I'm writing a transition letter to all the contacts on wisechoices email database to let them know of the former founder handing off the organization to me ! Give me your email if you would like to be put on the Wise Choices email database . You can comment below , message me , or email wisechoicesforyouth@gmail.com to ask to be put on the database . This is crazy ... Prayers are so appreciated ! 
1,000 tagged photos of me and not a single one uploaded from my camera . I love having Paparazzi photographer friends . :-) 
As children of God , we are now in the light . Jesus brought us from darkness to light . We do not need to try to walk in the light , or try to be lights by our actions . It's who we are because of Jesus . Enjoy Him and He'll shine through you today . :-) 
The more I study the topic of love , sex and relationships , the more I am amazed at God's beautiful design .

< PROPFEMALE > serenaded live on radio ? Check out the latest video on my wall . :-) 
On Christ the solid rock I stand , all other ground is sinking sand . 
You're worth the wait . :-) 
Happy Father's Day Papa , Nhoth Chouravong ! You've been an amazing example of my Heavenly Father . < PROPFIRST > Chouravong , this is your first father's day ! I know that you're gonna be a great father because you have a beautiful example . Also , < PROPFIRST > R . Castellanos , Grampa Pocholo . Without you , none of us would be here . Thank you for your compassion to take Papa into your loving care . 
The commandments are holy , just and good , but they do not give you the power to become holy , just and good . They only point you to a Saviour who is holy , just and good . He lived a holy , just and good life on our behalf , was punished for our past , present and future sin , and now has given us the gift of righteousness . Therefore , we stand holy , just and good before God . 
Simply put , to abide in Christ means one thing : To relax and trust His indwelling Life to motivate and mobilize our actions . It means to know that it's not up to us to make something happen ... It means to take our eyes off ourselves and just look at Him , knowing that there's nothing we have to do and that He will show us when to act and what to do when it's time to do it . It's a life of rest . - < PROPMALE > McVey

Sure enough , I approached him at the very end , and he gave me a $100 < PROPMALE > !

You are worth the life of Christ . 
Recently , I've encountered people who are discouraged with their job , their future or the health of a loved one . I want to encourage them , and HOW MUCH MORE does Jesus want to encourage you who are down ! HOW MUCH MORE does He want to heal your broken heart/body and make it better . If I can give good gifts to my boyfriend , if my dad can give good gifts to me , HOW MUCH MORE Papa in Heaven . He loves u perfectly . 
When talking about saving sex for marriage , there is a force even more powerful than self-control : LOVE . \

HOW TO MARRY THE RIGHT PERSON : The Bible tells us to run the race of life , fixing our eyes on Jesus ( Hebrews 12:1 -2 ) . One day , you’ll look over and see someone running - at the same speed , in the same direction . You say , “Hey , why don’t we run this race together ? ” Trust God . Follow peace . And run like you stole it ! 
Instead of using sex to fill the emptiness in your life , know that you are already loved completely by Christ . Sex will be an outflow to your spouse of the love you have received from above .

< PROPFIRST > Teodosio and I are so blessed to have such supportive , loving parents who would make the trip out to Corpus just to be there for us and give us moral support . We are who we are today because of you . Thank you Nhoth Chouravong and < PROPFIRST > R . Tourtellotte . 
Dad , may my ministry simply be an outflow of Your love to me . 
JESUS IS YOUR HIGH PRIEST STANDING AGAINST YOUR ACCUSERS . When the woman was caught in adultery , Jesus defended her and broke condemnation off her which empowered her not to sin again . He does the same to you today . 
When we are tempted to give up , we often think of reasons why we aren’t suited to advance through the trying circumstances we face . We see the challenges before us as monumental and our own weaknesses as glaring . In that moment of temptation , we must not fail to remember that our challenges aren’t to be compared to our abilities , but to the ability of the omnipotent God we serve . - < PROPMALE > McVey 
Dad , love me as I write .

OPPORTUNITY TO HELP : Today some dear people prayed for me regarding Wise Choices For Youth Inc . and spoke words of encouragement over me . < PROPFIRST > recorded it .

Don't you just love those times when God makes you smile ? It's all about relationship . Twitterpated . :-) 
AMI'S ODD TRIVIA : I like to click on \See Wall-to-Wall\ " with significant others and sigh at how cute their lovey-dovey posts are . It's so encouraging to see God's goodness displayed when he joins two lovebirds together ! " 
Sometimes I find myself doing things that I think will make my boyfriend like me more ( sing , play guitar , build running stamina , hula , grow my hair out , work out a certain area , etc . ) when I realize he loves me just the way that I am , for who I am . Isn't that the same way with God ? We don't need to impress . He loves YOU 100% for 100% YOU . 
Worry is finite thinking . 
Happy 32nd anniversary Mama and Papa ( Nhoth Chouravong) !!! 
IT'S OFFICIAL : We're engaged !!! 
Letting it all soak in ... I have a fiance . 
... and the wedding planning begins ! 
WEDDING QUESTION #1 : Where is a good outdoor ceremony location in or around San < PROPFIRST > ? 
WEDDING QUESTION #2 : Short engagement or long engagement ? Is 5 months too soon ? Is one year too long ? ( Keep in mind we would like to save our first lip-lock for the altar ... Lol ! ) 
WEDDING THOUGHT #1 : I want my wedding to be a display of Christ's love for His bride . \ 
SAVE THE DATE : April 30 , 2011 . I marry my best friend . 
Does anyone have the following items I can borrow from < PROPFIRST > 18- < PROPFIRST > 26 , 2011 for my nephew visiting from MN ? Car seat , ( for infant under 1 yr , about 20 lbs ) . \ 
Stroller ( doesn't need the carseat / stroller combo ) . Pack n ' play ( play pen to sleep in ) . Toys for an 11 month old --- he likes toys with sounds and lights . Highchair or/and booster seat . Thank you !! 
WEDDING THOUGHT #3 : Instead of striving to be sexually pure , realize that you have already been made pure by the blood of Christ . When you grasp how much Papa loves you , what is the natural outflow ? LOVE . \ 
Wise Choices For Youth Inc . 
SMALL FAVOR : Can anyone refer me to people who live in Pennsylvania ?
