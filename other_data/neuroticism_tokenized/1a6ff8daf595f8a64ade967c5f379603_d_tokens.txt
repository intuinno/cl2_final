Ah yes . . . the pleasure that is life . Is it a right of our own or just some blind stroke of luck brought on by the universe due to a combination of cosmic phenomenon with a < PROPMALE > of . 01 / 1000000000000000000000000000000000 . . . ? You make the call . 
Good night < PROPFEMALE > , and good luck . You'll need it . 
Fill my heart with song , Let me sing for ever more . You are all I long for , All I worship and adore . In other words , please be true . In other words , I love you 
My my . . . Does life get better as time goes on ? 
The battery on my lawnmower has refused to cooperate , forcing me to jump-start it . Mowing the yard was cut short due to someone leaving a hose lying about , which immediately was caught in the blades . Thus I had to pull it out manually . As I did so , various weeds placed barbs in my skin . So now , I am sitting at home , with thorns in my arms , alone . Oh happy day ! 
\Sometimes I sleep 
So ends Prom . This < PROPFEMALE > Story has faded too fast . I had so much fun . Shame to think it is all over . For now , of course . 
God , < PROPMALE > me the serenity\ 
To accept the things I cannot change ;\ 
The courage to change the things that I can ;\ 
And the wisdom to know the difference . 
\Would you rather find a hundred billion dollars or find true love ? \ " \ 
Courage is not doing something without fear , courage is being afraid to do something but doing it anyway . 
Remember that what's right isn't always popular , and what's popular isn't always right . 
\Aaaah ! Something's got me ! \ " \ 
I need a beeper on my brain or something , ' cause when I let that thing wander , it never comes back .

Eat pizza : $18 . \ 
Later we swing over to Stonebriar and watch Iron Man 2 : $30 . \ 
Drive everyone home with bass pumping so loud I think we blew out my speakers : $ ? Dinh nearly breaks my side window : $ ? \

What a way to end the weekend . 
Be brave . Even if you're not , pretend to be . No one can tell the difference .

It reads , \notice me . Make me feel important . \"" 
HOLY HELL !!! EPIPHANY !!!! 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! GOD , WHY !?!?!?!? THE PAIN ! FREAKIN ' POISON < PROPFEMALE > ! IT BURNS ! 
You promise me heaven and put me through hell . 
Why do we hurt ? Why do we cry ? \ 
Why do we cheat ? Why do we lie ? \ 
Is there not enough pain in this world that brings tears to our eyes ? \ 
Can we not stop and think of others , \ 
before hate consumes us from inside ? 
Holy mother of God . . . It happened , it realy happened !! We freakin ' graduated !!!! We've crossed the threshold ! Plunged into the future ! We've gone head-first into destiny !!! \ 
And we looked good doin ' it too ! :) 
I fell in love with shawty when I seen her on the dance floor\ 
She was dancing sexy , pop , pop , popping , dropping , dropping low\ 
Never ever has a lady hit me on the first sight\ 
This was something special ; this was just like dynamite\ 
Love that song . Danced like a fool to it on the bowling lanes though . Project Graduation = WIN !! 
You know , sometimes people think that when I give a compliment I'm being sarcastic , trying to hit on them , or just straight-up weird . However , I do what I do for a reason . People can be sad , apathetic , or just plain depressed and I decide to give a kind word ; say something nice . People should try it more often ; a single phrase can brighten someone's day . 
So where is the one I can hold tight ? \ 
Where is the one I can share the warm summer nights ? \ 
Where is the one I can help to feel right ? \ 
Where is the one that can set my soul alight ? \ 
What’s the point of being nice anymore ? \ 
What’s the point of holding open that damn door ? \ 
What’s the point in standing at the edge of the shore , hoping that the world will give you back something more ? 
I Might Have To Wait\ 
I'll Never Give Up\

Forgive me friends , my Internet connection is down , my phone is lost , and even if it wasn't , AT&Ts customer support is currently off-duty . . . damn . . . 
Cause the only real pain\ 
Your heart can never know\ 
Is the feeling of regret\ 
When you don’t let your feeling’s show\ 
So did you say it\ 
Did you mean it\ 
Did you lay it on the line , did you make it count\ 
Did you look ‘em in the eye & did they feel it\ 
Did you say in time\ 
Did you say out loud\ 
Cause if you did Hun\ 
Then you lived some\ 
And that feeling inside\ 
It’s called satisfied\ 
I guess there is a song for every soul . 
Ah . . . near-painful expreiences . Let me count the number of instances in this day alone . \ 
Dieter nearly fell on me coming off a slide , Alistar's foot was centimeters from taking out a few of my teeth , Johann ( or Dieter , I'm not sure which ) came very close to nailing me full on in the mouth with a ball , and the coup de grâce , practical ... ly kissing the pool-side pavement while doing a back-flip . I love summer ! 
Smee : \I've just had an apostrophe . \ " \ 
Don't forget that the quality of your life will be determined by the quality of the people in your life . :) 
Love comes to those who still hope even though they've been disappointed , to those who still believe even though they've been betrayed , to those who still love even though they've been hurt before . 
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted , No silent prayer for the faith-departed \ 
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd , You're gonna hear my voice When I shout it out loud\ 
It's my life . \ 
It's now or never . \ 
I ain't gonna live forever , I just want to live while I'm alive 
Is it possible ? Could the fools be so blind ? Is there realy a job oppurtunity for this < PROPMALE > ? To think they would accept me into their ranks ! So begins my ascension into the world of business ! \

I went to training today . . . I learned then the Universe loves messing with me . I heard \Don't Stop Beliveing\ " . . . twice . Cue my left I twitching as it does under stress . " 
Love's forever love is free , \ 
Let's turn forever , you and me . . . 
\Uh oh . \ " \ 
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor even touched , but just felt in the heart . 
I woke up today at 7:50 , an awful feeling in my side and a bruise on my arm . Funny , because it was then my pillow spoke . \ 
It asked me , \Where are you going

Every man is afraid of something . That's how you know he's in love with you ; when he is afraid of losing you . 
Well , I thought I had a mosquito bite on my arm earlier . I now realize it is a spider bite . Nothing like scratching an arm and pulling your hand away only to have some skin come with it . I may need to go to the doctor . \ 
Not fun . 
You're a shining < PROPFEMALE > , no matter who you are . \ 
Shining bright to see , what you could truly be . \

Fantastic . The area around my bite has now turned yellow and the swelling has not gone down . I will be going to the doctor tomorrow . . . yay .

7:11 AM . . . Good morning , friends . Summer is flying by so fast . Thank you all for making life so sweet . I ( is it love ? Yes , I do believe it is . ) love you all , and forever will , so much . 
If everyone cared and nobody cried , \ 
If everyone loved and nobody lied , \ 
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride , \ 
Then we'd see the day . . . when nobody died . . . 
Breakfast : three eggs , two pieces of toast , a bowl of cereal wih fruit , all while listening to Darude's Sandstrom . . . my morning is complete . 
We'll meet beyond the shore , we'll kiss just as before\ 
Happy we'll be beyond the sea , and never again I'll go sailin ' 
Ladies and Gentlemen , \ 
I hate seeing people unhappy . I try my best to do what I can . Sometimes it works , other times it doesn't . That doesn't stop me from trying . I wish I could tell you all , each and individually , just how amazing you are ; how sweet , smart , sexy , funny , incredible , endearing , unique , important , et cetera , all of you truly are . Keep on smiling . Never let the world get you down for more than a moment . 
Wow . What a night . From watching the A-Team , to chilling at Freebirds , me and company made the night fun . Even after our initial planning we couldn't get enough . We ran to Wal-mart and searched for ways to get us thrown out . Fun . Then we took picture after picture outside before meeting up at our old stomping grounds ; Prosper Highschool . You can't touch us ~ ! 
Hold tight cause the show is not over . \ 
If you will please move in closer . \ 
Your about to be bowled over . \ 
By the wonders you're about to behold here . \

Can't we give ourselves one more < PROPMALE > ? \ 
Why can't we give love that one more < PROPMALE > . . .. . . ' Cause love's such an old-fashioned word\ 
And love dares you to care for , the people on the edge of the night . \ 
And love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves . \

Ah yes , you can always count on family and close friends to bring up EMOTIONAL SHIT YOU DON'T WANT TO FUCKING TALK ABOUT !! \ 
Aside from that , helping my cousin try to catch a rabbit and smacking my forehead against a brick fountain was fun , aside from the pain of course . 
Happiness is just around the corner . :)

Well , you've got to march right up to this woman , right ? You look her right in the eye , you < PROPFEMALE > forward , right , just a little , just almost all the way . Then you let her < PROPFEMALE > forward just another little bit ' til you're just a lips distance away from each other , and then you just tell her . . . how much you hate her . 
Ah , Inception . Audiance's everywhere are questioning the legitimacy of their existences due to this fantastic film . Many , I am sure , have been very nearly driven insande by the implications imposed by this summer epic . Thankfully , as many of you know , I am not sane to begin with . As such , I slept very well after watching this film . Not a single dream was had . :) 
Ok , then . While you're here , I just want to tell you a little story . A small story that my daddy used to tell me ; he was a < PROPMALE > as well . I was born . . . probably about . . . sixty-eight years ago , over by that tree over there , yeah .

I had hope , I believed\ 
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived . \ 
You will pay for what you've done . \ 
No , no more sorrow\ 
I've paid for your mistakes . \ 
Your time is borrowed , \ 
Your time has come to be replaced ! 
Life is too sweet to give up . I am enjoying it thoroughly . Yes , life . It is so very delicious . 
All things come to an end ; that is simply the way things are . We cannot change it , we cannot avoid it . It is resolute ; unyielding . However , with every end , there is a new beginning . Though things may change and memories fade , there is always something new to be found and loved . Love , life and happiness shall end ; yet so too shall hate , death , and sorrow . The cycle is endless . Take heart , friends ; hope is eternal . 
Me : \Mom 
Memories fade , like looking through a fogged mirror . \ 
Decision to decisions are made and not bought . \ 
But I thought , this wouldn't hurt a lot . \

\Gently now . You just wanna kiss the ground . Just a little peck 
No , I will not stand there and watch you burn , even if it is something you deserve . \ 
No , I will not stand there and hear you cry , even if everything you told me was a lie . 
But there's no sense crying over every mistake , \ 
you just keep on trying till you run out of cake . \ 
Damn tears ! Damn sadness ! Humor isn't helping ! 
Rage is a hell of an anesthetic .

Love is everything it's cracked up to be . That's why people are so cynical about it . It really is worth fighting for , being brave for , risking everything for . The real trouble is , if you don't risk everything , you risk even more . 
For you ! For you , my life , my love , my all ! \ 
We'll see the twilight falling ! \ 
I'll come home to you ! \ 
Calling . . . yoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo ! \ 
I'll sing . . . a little song beneath the moon . \ 
And when I'm finished with my swooning , on my knees I'll fall ! \ 
My life ! My love ! My all ! \ 
Such a beautiful song . . . 
OH MY GOD ! I haven't found my soulmate ! That means she's all alone ! I can't just stand here while she might be lonely !!! 
My heart is beating , and it's only beating for you . 
People worry far too much . Alway's anxious , always afraid . Their fear causes them unnecessary pain , and I feel sorry for them . Yet , in my heart , I know I feel the same fear . I will always feel that fear , even if I do not show it . \ 
It is a terrible thing . . . 
I'm cool . 
The world of Hell is a state in which life is itself painful ; where anything you see makes you feel miserable . Such people need someone-anyone-to be at their side . They need someone who will be there for them , to listen and offer even just a few words of encouragement . That's all it may take for the flame of life to burn brightly once again in the heart of someone who is suffering deeply . \ 
I feel much better . 
Where is the love ? 
< PROPMALE > Hemingway once wrote , ' The world is a fine place and worth fighting for . ' I agree with the second part . 
4:00 , wallow in self pity . 4:30 , stare into the abyss . 5:00 , solve world hunger , tell no one . 5:30 , Jazzercize . 6:30 , dinner with me ; I can't cancel that again ! 7:00 , wrestle with my self-loathing ... I'm booked ! Of course , if I bump the loathing to 9:00 , I could still be done in time to lay in bed , stare at the ceiling , and slip slowly into madness . 
A true friend knows your weaknesses but shows you your strengths ; feels your fears but fortifies your faith ; sees your anxieties but frees your spirit ; recognizes your disabilities but emphasizes your possibilities . 
Love is a word , what matters is the connection that word implies . \

OH MY GOD ! Why do I feel such a sudden sense of joy !? There's no reason for it , I just feel happy ! So weird . . . something must be wrong with me , but I won't question it . I need to share it !!!
