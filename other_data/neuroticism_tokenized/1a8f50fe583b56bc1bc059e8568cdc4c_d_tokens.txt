Adversity is another way to measure the greatness of individuals . I never had \ 
a crisis that didn't make me stronger . 
Make it a rule of life never to regret and never to look back . Regret is an appalling waste of energy ; you can't build on it ; it's only good for wallowing in . \

If the wind will not serve , take to the oars . 
While I know myself as a creation of God , I am also obligated to realize and remember that everyone else and everything else are also God's creation . \

God has a divine plan for your life . Like < PROPFIRST > , however , Jesus needs you to step out of the boat so that you may progress toward your greater purpose . The boat symbolizes your comfort zone . It is the place you return to when it appears God isnt doing things when and how you planned . Resist the urge to be stuck . Get out of the boat ! \

Thought for the Day : “There are times that it’s hard to see past this very moment . So , take it one moment at a time : ask God for the next moment , then the next hour , then the next day before you know it you will be beyond the storm . ” 
If you are feeling pain , then why not turn to the one who was brutally nailed to some wood ? Jesus Christ knows about pain and rejection . 
\Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered 
Thought for the Day : “If we ever feel God isn’t close to us , it wasn’t God who moved . ” 
Happiness formula = Do YOUR best and feel good about it . \ 
Unhappiness formula = Compare yourself to others . 
When you place conditions upon your happiness , you place that joy in a future tense . 
There is a decision one has to make : God’s word is either true all of the time or it isn’t - I don’t think there is any in between . 
Here is a test to find whether your mission on Earth is finished : If you're alive it isn't\

\It is our choices ... that show what we truly are 
Thought for the Day : “Don’t let the past hold you back from the future God has for you ! What do you need to do so you can move forward ? Forgive ? Love ? Heal ? Whatever it is that you need to do , do it now - because today is the day you start to put the past behind you and move forward again with Him . ” 
Thought for the Day : “God hates sin but still loves the sinner . No matter how hard we try , we will never be free of some type of sin . Being just , God requires payment for our sins . However , He has already paid the price for us - all we need to do is accept His forgiveness . ” Have a beautiful day today my friends knowing God loves you ! – < PROPFIRST > Laydon

“God created the oak tree , which grows tall , straight , and strong . He also created the palm , which bends and sways in the changing winds . We need to learn to adopt the traits of both so we can be strong yet flexible – so we can weather the storms of life yet not break when life’s winds blow too hard . ” 
Remain thoughtfully in the field of infinite possibilities rather than your negative emotions—fear , worry , hate , and shame are indicators of separation from your authentic self in the present moment . - 
When one door closes , endless doors are STILL open . When one thought limits you , endless thoughts are still available . The more you feel a sense of the Infinite inside ,... the more power you have available to you . How to feel it ? Look up at the sky or at the ocean and visualize becoming ONE with them . Look with child-like wonder . 
When the wind is blowing hard against you , you still have the ability to guide your life on a path that will eventually arrive at your destination 
“Everyone has a past that is done and written in stone . Everyone also has a future that is a blank slate . No matter what we have done in the past , God always leaves the door open for us to return to Him and fill up our blank slate with a great story of our days to come . ” 
Celebrate every relationship you have ever had . For better or worse , our relationships are our best teachers . And on a soul level , we've attracted each and every one of them so we can learn and grow . 
I have no idea of what my purpose in this life is . Prayed about it ... still no clue . Just keep on praying and hope I nail it before I die . 
Thought for the Day : “I have found that when we try to impress others , God is impressed the least . God doesn’t care if you wear the latest fashions or drive the fanciest car . He cares what’s in your heart . He sees the value of the things unseen about you and I . ” Have a spectacular day today my friends ! – < PROPFIRST > Laydon 
Your soul - that inner quiet space- is yours to consult . It will always guide you in the right direction . 
When you truly understand what it means to live peacefully , satisfaction will begin to replace your < PROPFEMALE > for more . 
We sometimes spend so much time thinking of our problems that we often overlook the wonderful things God has given us . We wait for the big miracles and miss the countless small blessings . 
Fear can sometimes seem like a mountain standing before us with no way around it . Allowing fear to defeat us is the easy choice . The hard choice can be to face and take on those fears ; however , with God by our side and our faith firmly planted in Him , those fears can be crushed until they appear to be just a bump in the road .
