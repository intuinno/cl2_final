Today during homeroom , a boy was sitting in the corner crying , because his girlfriend had just broken up with him . The rest of the boys were crowded around him , comforting him . Meanwhile , the girls ( myself included ) were chasing each other around the classroom , playing a game of keep away with someone's pencil case . My teacher pointed out that we had it all backwards . Somehow , I liked it just the way it was . MLIA .
