PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this .

From the Bracket article on wikipedia : Parentheses may also be nested ( with one set ( such as this ) inside another set ) . This is not commonly used in formal writing [ though sometimes other brackets ( especially parentheses ) will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses ( in other words , secondary { or even tertiary } phrases can be found within the main sentence )]
