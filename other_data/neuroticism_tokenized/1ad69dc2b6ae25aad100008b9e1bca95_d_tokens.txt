Did anyone watch the < PROPFIRST > May's memorial service ? 

I got my driver's license ! 
So apparantly there's a pot luck at my house and I'm not even invited . Well , thanks for letting me know < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
What do people do on facebook all day ? I don't get it :( 
Hmmm .... Where do I start . So after 15 hours of listening to our neighbor's fire alarms going off for no reason , ours are now going off ( for the third time today ) at 4am . No sleeping tonight I guess :/ 
Thank you to whoever ruined and threw away my poster of < PROPMALE > the Bull . 
Got to hold a baby possum today :) 
Just used google Earth street view to walk past my childhood home , Providence Elementary school , and Kempsville Middle School in < PROPFEMALE > . If only there was google x-ray , I could go inside too . 
What shud I get my dad for Christmas ?
