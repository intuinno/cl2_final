\Those that only look behind will be the ones to hit the branch .......... \ " but remember .... \ " when you hit the bottom .... You can only go up \"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< 3 3 > " 
Life has a funny way of sending u the smallest things just at the right times that encourage us 2 keep on keepin on .... AMAZING !! Still going ! 
On a mission ...... and VERY determined !!!!!!!! 
Each \ 
morning when I open my eyes I say to myself : I , not events , have the \ 
power to make me happy or unhappy today . I can choose which it shall be . \ 
Yesterday is dead , tomorrow hasn't arrived yet . I have just one day , \ 
today , and I'm going to be happy in it . 
day is a new canvas to paint upon . Make sure your picture is full of \ 
life and happiness , and at the end of the day you don't look at it and \ 
wish you had painted something different . 
“Life\ 
is full of beauty . Notice it . Notice the bumble < PROPFEMALE > , the small child , \ 
and the smiling faces . Smell the rain , and feel the wind . Live your life\ 
to the fullest potential , and fight for your dreams . ” 
Yesterday is history . Tommorrow is a mystery . And today ? Today is a gift\ 
that's why they call it the present . 
It has taken me way too long to figure out what was most important in my life and now that I have , I can leave the past behind .... move on with the future , and spend each new day striving to be the person I should have been the whole time . 
Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass ... \ 
It's about learning how to dance in the rain .... <3 
<3 You will never know happiness until you have known sadness . Therefore , \ 
the only way to experience success , is to have experienced failure . <3 
We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting \ 
something we don't have , but rather of recognizing and appreciating what\ 
we do have . <3<3<3 
** Most of the important things in \ 
the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when \ 
there seemed to be no hope at all . ** 
Had the most wonderful day swimming in the pool with my ' lil water babies ..... then settled down to a funny movie ... naps and a little mamma time !!!!!!! What a great day ... miss ' em already !!!!!!!! 
No man/woman is worth your tears and the only one who is , will never make you cry . If you love someone , put their name in a circle , instead of a heart , because hearts can break , but circles go on forever <3 
going to the pool with my girls !!!!! Fun day !!!! Whoop whoop ....... 
Ohhhh dang !!!!!! what a weekend it has been , never thought I would be < PROPFEMALE > ready for monday !!!!!!!!!! Missin ' my babies already !!!!!!! Peace love and all that other stuff to all !!!!!! 
I got a job ! Yay < PROPFEMALE > dang happy ! Thank u god ! Those prayers worked ! Now 2 make some money !!! God bless ;) 
When you close your eyes and ears , and open your heart and mind is when you find true happiness !!!!! And having a special someone doesn't hurt either !!!!! Loving every minute of it !!!!! 
Count your blessings instead of your crosses ; Count your gains instead of your losses . Count your joys instead of your woes ; Count your friends instead of your foes . Count your smiles instead of your tears ; Count your courage instead of your fears . Count your full years instead of your lean ;\ 
Count your kind deeds instead of your mean . Count your health instead of your wealth ; Count on God instead of yourself . <3 
The most important thing in my life right now are the 4 most beautiful , wonderful , awesome , amazing , awe inspiring , sweet , special blessings that God was so generous to < PROPMALE > me , my BABIES !!!! I see the face of GOD every time I look at them , and I am so thankful to have my own piece of heaven here on earth ... and their Daddy's not so bad himself .... Love you and you guys are my whole world !!! <3<3<3<3<3 
SOOOO thankful for everything in my life right now ....... I don't think it can get any better ..... Love my babies , and life .......... i'm as happy as an ant in a bag of sugar !!!! LOL , really !!!!!! <3<3<3<3 
Have a heart that never hardens , a temper that never tires , a touch that never hurts , and a mind that never closes ... With all of these , we can make the world a place worth living in !! 
I am SO over the DRAMA !!! People need to get a life and know when to grow up and take responsibility for their actions !!!! I damn sure did !! So I will pray for all of the lost souls out there , may GOD have mercy on them !! 
Well , What a day I have had !!!! Taking my class to get my 2-15 license , and I gotta learn a 500 < PROPFEMALE > book in 5 days ????? LOL seriously ??????????? Dang it man ..... I better pass this thing !!!! Peace and Love to all !! 
Well , well ...... what a day , a long , boring , aggravating , wasted day !!!!! I am ready for a good night's sleep !!! 
I just want things to be the way they should have been sooo damn long ago ... I am doing all that I can but it seems like it is not enough .... why is the right way always the hardest ???? God bless , and NEVER take even the smallest things for granted , because you never know when they may become the most important .... 
\For every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it . For every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it . For every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it . \"< 3 <3<3<3 " 
“We were given two hands to hold , two legs to walk , two eyes to see , two ears to listen . But why only one heart ? Because the other was given to someone else , for us to find . ” <3<3<3<3 
Flatter me , and I may not believe you . Criticize me , and I may not like \ 
you . Ignore me , and I may not forgive you . Encourage me , and I will not \ 
forget you . Love me and I may be forced to love you . 
“To\ 
love is to risk not being loved in return . To hope is to risk pain . To \ 
try is to risk failure , but risk must be taken because the greatest \ 
hazard in life is to risk nothing . ” <3<3<3<3 
“Happiness\ 
is a butterfly , which when pursued , is always just beyond your grasp , \ 
but which , if you will sit down quietly , may alight upon you” <3<3<3<3<3 !!! 
“If toast always lands butter-side down , and cats always land on their feet , what happens if you strap toast on the back of a cat and drop it ? ”

When you have to wonder where you ' stand ' with someone , it's time to wonder why the hell you care ?... So don't make someone a priority in your life when you are only an option in theirs !!!!!!.

If you want to succeed in your life , remember this phrase : That past does not equal the future . Because you failed yesterday ; or all day today ; or a moment ago ; or for the last six months ; the last sixteen years ; or the last fifty years of life , doesn't mean anything ... All that matters is : What are you going to do , right now ? - < PROPFIRST > Robbins

I learn to love it more and more . \

Sometimes life does not go the way we planned , no matter how hard we try , it just doesn't work out how we thought it would . But , from these defeats comes the renewed strength and courage to move on from the past and face the future with a smile on our face and faith in our hearts .. The end is just a new beginning !!! <3<3

Every dream begins with a dreamer . Always remember , you have within you the strength , the < PROPFEMALE > , and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world .. 
To laugh often and much ; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children , to leave the world a better place , to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived , this is to have succeeded . \

Past is past . And somethings in the past are meant to be forgotten so you can live on . I like the present and what the future brings !! What a smile that special someone .. or something brings to your face ???? What about the past ??? Who or what is that ?????? ???? SOOO here now baby !!!! 
Happiness comes from counting our blessings , appreciating little things - a\ 
flower by a stream , seagulls circling over the ocean , laughter of little children , \ 
a call from a lover , a challenge met . It comes from celebrating\ 
the moment - not waiting for all our problems to be solved . May you all find your true happiness .. I think I have finally found mine <3<3<3 
I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge -- myth is more potent than history -- dreams are more powerful than facts -- hope always triumphs over experience -- laughter is the cure for grief -- love is stronger than death . \

Children will not remember you for the material things you provided , but for the feeling that you cherished them . Make sure you let them know every day that they are your world , and with that , may they go on to bestow that feeling upon the world .... <3<3<3

Hope is a state of mind , not of the world . Hope , in this deep and powerful sense , is not the same as joy that things are going well , or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success , but rather an ability to work for something because it is good .. <3<3<3 
Live with intention . Walk to the edge . Listen hard . Practice wellness . Play with abandon . Laugh . Choose with no regret . Appreciate your friends . Continue to learn . \ 
Do what you love . Live as if this is all there is . \

Ok .... sitting on the beach in miami ...... life is freaking GREAT ........ LOVE IT ..... LOL 
Ohhh my geeeeezzzzzeeee .... lol sleep ... we used to be tight , like you were my homie ... no more ..... I guess we got too distant ... lol .... miss you and wish you were not soooo damn elusive ...... ahhhhhh .... 
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons\ 
Finally content with a past I regret I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness ...

There's a pain in her heart , she's trying so hard to unwind\ 
Makes her cry in the night , when visions so real make her blind\ 
Wants to break through the fear\ 
Erasing the scars from within\ 
Start a new kind of being - she's down and she's praying again ... 
Life ain't always beautiful . You think you're on your way , And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day\ 
But the struggles makes you stronger , And the changes make you wise , And happiness has its own way of takin ' it sweet time .. <3<3<3 
If you aren't good at loving yourself , you will have a difficult time loving anyone , since you'll resent the time and energy you give another person that you aren't even giving to yourself . <3<3<3 
OMG .... HAPPIEST of Birthday wishes to my baby Boo !!!!! I love you Girl ... hope you have a GREAT day and Momma will be there soon to help you celebrate !!!!!! LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
You're old enough some people say .. To read the signs and walk away . It's only time that heals the pain ,, And makes the sun come out again ... It's raining again ... C'mon you little fighter , No need to get uptighter .. C'mon you little fighter\ 
And get back up again .. Oh get back up again .. Fill your heart again ... <3<3<3 
When this old world starts getting me down , And troubles are just too much for me to face , I climb way up to the top of the stairs , And all my cares just drift right into space . On the roof , it's peaceful as can be , And there the world below can't bother me ??? 
AHahahahahahaha .. No matter what any of you do or say , you will never break me , nor can you shake me ... I am on solid ground now and I found my balance ... NEVER gonna loose it again ... to all the people in the past .. thank you .. you gave me the strength to be the WOMAN I am today .... and to the future ... don't play games with me cuz ur gonna come in last !! <3<3<3 
You can laugh at my behavior , that'll never bother me . Say the Devil is my savior but I don't pay no heed . And I will go on shining , shining like brand new . I'll never look behind me , my troubles will be few .... <3<3<3
