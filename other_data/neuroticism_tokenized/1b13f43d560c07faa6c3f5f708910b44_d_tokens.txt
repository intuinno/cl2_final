Hanging out at < PROPFEMALE > Plumadore's house going to harrigons then home later :D <3 i am happy 

CHECK OUT HOW TODAY HAS GONE SO FAR IN MY PHOTOS HAHA 
Its my second day on Facebook ! Why didn't I get an account sooner ???? lol 
Tripped on a flat surface and hit the frame of my bedroom door this morning . lol i'm such a clutz xD 
I'm having a terrible day today ... I hope it gets better ... T-T 
Yesterday evening was beautiful , especially with the rainbow that came after that storm . It really helped me feel better . Hehe ! -^^- 
Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 <3 <3 
Thinking up new story ideas while listening to Utada Hikaru ! XD 
I'm REALLY bored ... So i'm gonna poke people ! XD 
Oh my god ! I had a dream about you last night ! -^^- \ 
\ 
R-really ?? <3 \ 
Yeah ! You died ! :D \ 
* awkward silence * 
A lot of interesting things have been happening lately , good AND bad . Hopefully the good starts to outweigh the bad . -^^- 
I don't like the facebook fortune teller . T-T 
Yesterday I was in Wal-Mart and saw two flags hanging up near Da < PROPFEMALE > Nails ( which personally I think should be renamed \Dahvie Nails\ " but whatever ) . One of the flags was American and the other was Canadian . The Canadian one was bigger . o.o .................................. No surprise there ! XD " 
Don't you just love it when the credits are at the BEGINNING of the movie ? Yeah , me neither ... -_-' 
I hate it when someone asks me what I'm looking at when I've staring up at the sky :\ 
\Do you see a bird ? \ " \ " No . \ " \ " Do you see a plane ? \ " \ " Nope . \ " \ " ... Superman ? \ " \ " Definitely . \ " :P " 
The Great Escape yesterday with my lil sis was incredible ( except for the epic battle between the sun and rain for control ... but the sun won in the end so the weather wasn't TOO terrible ! :P ) !!! Thanks for having me along , parents of < PROPFEMALE > !!! You guys are great !!! XD 
Normalcy is dull and overrated . :P Wouldn't you agree ? ;) 
I have never seen your eyes , but I feel their love . \ 
I have never heard your voice , but I feel it calling my name . \ 
We have never met , but we have always known each other . \ 
Hoping you are well , wherever you are , \ 
Nicholas\ 
(-blushes- N-Not my best , but I still wanted to share it with you guys . So what do you think ? ) 
First i was addicted to Prison Break and now im addicted to Lost ! Must watch Lost ! O.O 
Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday ! You guys are awesome ! XD <3 
Just took a walk to find some ideas for a story I'm thinking of writing . Now listening to Evanescence in my room . Yay Evanescence ! :D <3 
Ughie ... I took a walk today -- which should have been refreshing , but for some reason , it made me sad ... I need someone to walk with me . :) <3 
Dear < PROPFIRST > Koontz , \ 
I just finished reading one of your many novels and now I must read the other three in the series , and it might not end there once I'm finished . I'm hooked , and I curse you for it . Keep the stories coming ! <3 \ 
Sincerely addicted , \ 
< PROPMALE > Beecher 
For some reason , i cannot view any comments on my posts . :( so until i find a way to fix that , if you wanna contact me , just message me ( or text me if you have my number ) . 
Planning on using Facebook more frequently . Btw i clicked \7 other < PROPFEMALE > s\ " on my wall post \ " Nicholas Beecher likes House of Leaves and 7 other < PROPFEMALE > s\ " to see if it was going to work properly and it ended up bringing me to my Friends < PROPFEMALE > . On what plane of existence does that make sense ? -sighs- " 
< PROPMALE > Mosby is not a jerk :3 
Just finished watching the 2nd season of True Blood . It was so messed up ! o.e in other words , i loved it . <3 
\Your love is yummy 
Happy Saint < PROPFIRST>'s Day everyone ! <3 <3 <3 
Watched the video from The Ring and the phone rang . < PROPFEMALE > , you creeper . XP 
Help ! Is there anyone out there that has an above average to extensive amount of knowledge concerning different types of religions or belief systems in general ? 
It snows . It rains . It snows . It rains . The weather is so indecisive this time of year . >.< 
Sookie : Is there something else you're not telling me ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : No . \ 
-Sookie attempts to read < PROPFEMALE>'s thoughts-\ 
< PROPFEMALE > : -thinking- La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la ... \ 
Sookie : What are you doing ? o.O \ 
( from True Blood , season 1 , episode 5 \Sparks Fly Out \")" 
I looked into my heart and saw some things i didnt wanna see ... Its time to make some changes . 
Haunting us , these different meanings and spectral beings . We're fighting sleep with broken , rusted weaponry . Sing so softly and low , like you want me to hear . Stolen what you can't afford , What's that muffle beating for ? 
The early bird gets the worm , but I bet it'd rather go back to sleep ... :P 
Today was eventful . Had fun . Tired . :P 
\It's better to help people than a garden gnome . \ " It's not everyday that i find a character i can relate to as much as Amélie Poulain . <3 " 
Love makes us weak . But when is anything ever that simple ? Opening up to them , making ourselves vulnerable to them speaks volumes of how special they are to us . And i guess in a paradoxical sort of way it makes us stronger too since it takes strength to let down our guard like that . Ugh ! Love is too complicated to talk about like this ... >.< 
Found out the brakes on my bike arent working ( dont worry i wasnt near the road at the time ) so ill just settle for taking a walk instead . :3 
-huffs- 
If you're actually taking the time to read this status , whether you're anyone from a close family member to someone i only really know the name and face of but seems kinda nice , thank you for doing so ! Love ya ( unless you're a creeper ... the bad kind) ! <3 
I think you know that thing i thought i knew you thought i knew . I think . :P 
If each of us bears our own Hell , let us endure them together . :) 
\i think she's a garconanokin . \ " \ 
You know someone's important to you when you miss them as soon as you stop hearing from them ... 
Things were complicated enough a year ago . Now i miss how simple it really was .... 
You and i wake up in a police car together . Using FOUR words only , what would you say to me ? \ 
NOTE : Taken from < PROPFEMALE > Fink's wall ' cause the note said to do so if anyone comments on it ( that way she can comment back ) . Everyone is welcome to comment though ! <3 Just make sure to comment on hers too if you know her . 
\kiss me k-k-kiss me infect me with your lovin ' fill me with your poison take me t-t -take me wanna be a victim ready for abduction ! \ " \ 
Posted a short little < PROPFEMALE > tale in my notes . Everyone's welcome to read . Just let me know how you feel about afterwards if you do . :) 
Not having a good day ... and where is all the glitter coming from ??? O.o 
I like to justify life's unfairness by saying fate will give us something worth the pain , either in this life or the next . But do i truly believe this ? Although my faith is constantly being tested , i would say yes . Yes i do . 
The REAL reason it's been raining so freaking much this year . And by \real\ " i mean \ " in-the-magical-land-of-Not-Really real . \ " :3 \ 
Had a nightmare just before starting my day . Lovely ... 
Sighhh ... 
Ive gotta find out the answers to those questions people are answering about me but i cant on facebook mobile ... I need to get on the computer more often ... :( 
Urgh ! I just answered two questions on FriendTruths by accident so if you get a answer from me that doesn't seem right , SORRRYYYYY !!!!! D ' : 
Lil sis is 16 today ! :D jeez im only 18 and i already feel like a fossil ... XP 
You probably cant hear me wherever you are ... but i miss you nonetheless .... 
My new phone has a camera ! Yaaay ! <3 but it wont let me post them on fb ... :( 
Just started reading House of Leaves again and it's already messing with my head ... >.< 
Hear that ?...... That's the sound of you reading my status . Music to my ears . :3 
Started rewriting one of my old stories last night with a few changes and improvements . I missed these characters . lol 
\Passion has little to do with euphoria and everything to do with < PROPFEMALE > . It is not about feeling good . It is about endurance . Like < PROPFEMALE > 
Liked the new Transformers movie . Fireworks were pretty while they lasted ... but no finale ...? Oh well ... Going home to watch the Exorcist for the first time in forever . Can't wait . :3 
I have no doubt that cupid will eventually lead me to the one im meant to be with . But boy isnt he a sadist in the meantime ? 
Kinda wanna go to the mall today for a few hours . 
Mew mew :3 
Melodies of love and lust , heart and heat , feed my ears and fill my mind , evoking past and future incarnations of my present self . This is the power of music . Listen and learn . 
A lot of people seem to be going through a transition of some kind . Myself included . 
Dying of heat ... but happy nonetheless :3 
So hoooot .... x_x 
Give me your hearts ! <3 .... no , literally *_* 
Number 63 , i found your picture all dirty on the side of bucks corners . Its still there if you or someone else wants to claim it . 
It looks like Number 63 hasn't responded today ... Oh well . I wonder if his pic will still be lying there the next time I go that way . 
-sighs-going to bed ... all i want to do is dream 
All of these questions buzzing in my head are going nowhere ... Hopefully work will distract me . 
Work in an hour . Wont be home til 5:30 ish . Ugh it sounds like forever from now when i put it into words . XP hopefully will be as good ( or better than ) yesterday . 
Longest . Day . Ever . But hey at least we're getting more work done . And we have pizza . :3 
Im gonna spontaneously combust x_x 
Watching \the haunting of < PROPFEMALE > hartley\ " . Its so-so ... I like the ending though . :3 " 
Im not updating my status this time . Oh wait ... 
Cellar door . They say its one of ( if not the most ) beautiful sounding combination of words in the english language . 
wants to go home and put radiohead's \videotape\ " on repeat . " 
Friendtruths :\ 
Have you ever had a crush on --- --- ? \

... 
Donated blood for the first time yesterday ! Gonna do it again the next time im able :3 
\okaaay time to bring these to your grandmother deep in the wolf-infested woods all by yourseeelf ! \ " \ 
Dreams are so confusing no matter how much you remember ... 
How am i feeling ? ... i honestly have no idea . Good ? Bad ? Hungry ? Its a mystery to me . :/ 
Finally updated my profile pic ! Yaaay ! :3 
I dont know who you are , where you are , whether or not i already know you ... but i do know you're out there somewhere . And i know the time will come when we can be finally be together . Just dont give up hun . I wont . :) 
< PROPFIRST > ( to Jenn ): Could you be a darlin ' and hand that to me ? \ 
Me : I can be a darlin ' . :3 
Dear Future Self , \ 
Exactly when are things gonna get noteably better ? A few hours now ? A few day ? Weeks ? \ 
Sincerely You , \ 
< PROPMALE > 
Feet huuurt ... cant wait to get home and work on my story . 
Im almost always aware that im dreaming when its happening . I guess that makes me a lucid dreamer . Doesnt make my dreams any less confusing thats for sure . Speaking of which , back to bed i go ! 
\you're in denial . \ " \ 
Still no power . Hoo-freakin-rah ... 
My mind may forget but my heart will always remember . Your name and face may fade , but how you make me feel will stay forever . 
< PROPFEMALE > ( picks up the toad ): Hello , Grandmother Toad . Show us the path . \ 
Will : Oh , god . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Show us the way and I'll give you a kiss . -walks up to Will and licks the toad right in his face-\ 
Will : Oh , my , that's just not right . o.o 
Teacher : Why dont you take the empty seat next to that mysterious boy you're destined to have a fatalistic relationship with that will spawn four books and a movie franchise ? 
Supernatural AND anime ?? TOGETHER ??? It's a dream come true ! <3 
< PROPFIRST > or < PROPFIRST > ? .... < PROPFIRST > ! No , no , < PROPFIRST > . Definitely < PROPFIRST > . Wait ! Uhhhh ... I can't choose ! They're both so amazing ! <3 <3 <3

Devil is a movie about five people trapped in an elevator . One of them is secretly the devil . Although it isnt revealed until the end , all of the characters are made to seem likely suspects for different reasons . And i am happy to say i found out who it was the second i saw the character . Intuition wins again ! <3 
Fill up my heart with love , \
