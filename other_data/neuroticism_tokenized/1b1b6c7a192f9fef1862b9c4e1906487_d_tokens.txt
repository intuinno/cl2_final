send me a number ! 
88- dude i can't believe we have been friends since we were 14 . its crazy when i sit and think about it . your husband cracks me up and it sucks we don't ever get to see eachother . but i expect to see you at my wedding ! 
2405- ya'll are the cutest couple ever , if you could get over the little things and things from the past me and phia think you would make the best family . I couldn't see either of you be with anyone else but eachother . 
im about to tear up this number game . haha ! 
525600- you're super cute ! i used to think you would be an ass since you were the quiet mysterious guy that played acoustic guitar all the time . but you're awweesoommee !!! i used to love being inebriated and riding around in your loud ass mustang and zone out lol 
3 ! you're super dumb ! especially when you're ^ . i have anxiety about you leaving sometimes , but don't take that to heart and feel special or anything . you have a big ass , and don't pay attention to shit around you ! 
2 : you and < PROPFIRST > were my favorite people at work . you're always < PROPFEMALE > happy lol i think everyone liked you 
#1 you my 5000 dolla ho !! i really wish we didn't move away from eachother cuz i missed you sooooo much and i think with someone like you were around things would have been very very different for me . and a lot less angry and depressing lol 
#2727 - you're half black half white and slightly round ! lol . besides < PROPFIRST > you're my favorite out of all of my brothers friends . 
1018 i miss you !! i always run into you in the most random places at the most random times lol 
8 : everytime i think about you i touch myself . hahahaha !... \ 
k seriously i didn't see us ' not talking ' forever especially because we still have a lot of mutual friends . i think we all just grew up and realized being angry and pettiness is super lame . plus we have bigger things to worry about lol . i bet youre one of those hos that don't have any stretch marks or anything after having a baby huh ?! 
60 woop woop ! you and < PROPFIRST > were the only things keeping me from going insane in england and i love ya'll for that ! it sucks i ended up hating you before i left but i was a very angry teenager lol . you're also one of the prettiest people ive ever met , and definitely one of the most memorable ! 
6 : for someone i only < PROPMALE > out with for like 3 months we do a good job of staying in touch lol . i tell everyone the story of how red beat < PROPMALE > rays ass hahahaha , it is still my favorite story of all time . you still have ostrich eyes though . i miss you !! you need to come back , you're the only one that says unforgivable shit to people when you're pissed at them like i do .. hahahaha
