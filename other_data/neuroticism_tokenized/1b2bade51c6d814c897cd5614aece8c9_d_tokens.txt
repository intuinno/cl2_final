I had a way high ( 103 ) fever off and on for the last 24 hours . . Could not go to the dr because the insurance co's computers were down and they have to set itup 
. . . so I started feeling a little better and went to the store for soda & felt like I had worked a full shift in 15 mins . . Guess I'm not better . . 
Am I the only one who feels like no matter how much I work I am barely treading water ??? 
There is no such thing as a never ending shift . . Although today sure as hell seems like it ! 
< PROPMALE > . I could not sleep . . . Figured i would do something constructive but that i could still do in bed . Tehe and since i was by myself this was the result . :-) 
\Some days there won't be a song in your heart . Sing anyway . \ " Today I am just trying to . . . At least hum . "

Watched < PROPFEMALE > . . . The one about dreaming . I love PBS .. it feeds my head something besides junk food . Now I just want to go back to bed but I have to work and not a day off in sight . . . why ??? Quite frankly that pisses me off . 
That's it that's all that's it for last call . . If you don't live here , sleep here , or sleep with someone who lives here . . You're outta here ! 
So yes I have to work tonight but I feel blessed and lucky that I GET to work tonight , that I have the freedom as a woman to DRIVE or to walk to work , that I have the protection of my UNION . I am proud and lucky to be an AMERICAN !!! Thank you troops . . !
