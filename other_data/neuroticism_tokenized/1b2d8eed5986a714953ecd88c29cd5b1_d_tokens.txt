Happy New Year everybody . 

Can't wait for Easter weekend 
As of today , I'm finally a UNL Senior ! 
The missionaries are so impressed by my manly beard that they say that it's righteous ! 
Anime Iowa this Friday , and I've got 36 hours to create a Little Big Planet sackperson for a cosplay . It can happen ! 
Well , I did the Sackboy cosplay . Definitely needs some tweaking if I want to wear it at another convention . 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone , working at NebrasKon was great , and I enjoyed being told Happy Birthday over the walkie-talkies .
