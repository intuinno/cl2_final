FOOD 4 THOUGHT : A WOMAN WILL DO ANYTHING HER MAN WANTS HER 2 DO .... SO LONG AS HE LOVES HER THE WAY SHE WANTS 2 B LOVED 
Good night FB fam i need to go to bed 
OMG ...... why did one of my 80yr old patients just hit on me ...... i so need to go home .....

Be very careful if you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears . The woman came out of a man's rib , not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal ! Under the arm to be protected , & next to the heart to be loved . Copy and paste if you agree . Yeah Evaney i like this had to repost on my < PROPFEMALE > 
SIT ON IT and BLOW IT ...... LMBO

LEARNING TO LET GO AND LET GOD 
True friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never question your friendship . This type of friend picks up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it's been , how far away they live & they don’t hold grudges . They understand that life's busy but , that you'll always love them . Repost this if you're lucky to have at least 1 of these friends . 
* sigh * AAA hurry up 
That was quick ... * smiles * they are here 
LOVE why is it so hard .... why don't people follow there heart .... why deny love when its right there .... why run from it .... * sigh *.....* just random thinking * 
Having a wonderful time out with fam on the Mall :-) 
Sometimes you put walls up not to keep people out but to see who cares enough to break them down . 
* smiles * I have two beautiful healthy happy kids that I love more than anything ... and that's all that matters ... GOD will put everthing else in place when the time is right ....

I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control & at times hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure as heck don't deserve me at my best . If you're a HANDFUL , repost ! I dare you !

STOP THE VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN : Change your Facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday , December 6 , there should be no human faces on Facebook , but an invasion of wonderful childhood memories . 
just got done playing < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > the Experience on the wii with the kids .... man that game is < PROPFEMALE > FUN :) 
To everyone that wished me Happy Birthday ... THANK YOU sooo much ... I greatly appreciate all the love ... :-) 
* SIGH * time for some musical therapy ... its just one of those days 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of LIFE , GETTING BACK UP IS LIVING ~ repost it if you agree , I did ! 
I HATE T-Mobile ... * Angry face*my phone is F*%king up .... uuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh 
Ok now part of this question comes from a friends page . if you knew that someone is most likely NOT a good match for you . would you still date them and have the experience and lessons learned . OR would you pass on it and never know . BUT to that question if you have been going after what you think is a GOOD match for you and it has not worked out . wouldn't it be better to try something different.so tell me what ya'll think 
WTF ... 
On my way to the Springs for practice ... 
Practice was fun ... got a lot done ... i needed to be there tonight ... got my mind somewhat clear ...
