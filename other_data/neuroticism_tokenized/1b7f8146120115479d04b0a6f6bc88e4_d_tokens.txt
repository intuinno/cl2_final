Americas Army V 3.0 is a lot like CoD4 
Gonna make like a bad motha fuck and go play some Heros of Newerth 
Who doesn't eat pot roast at 4AM ? 
Anyone want a Heroes of Newerth beta invite ? 
Of course I'm getting sick , why would today be any different . 
So pumped , five days until Social D is up in the 330 ! 
I start at West on monday pending a drug test . 
KAHHHHNNNNNNNN !!!! 
My legs hurt from Social Distortion last night , my god was it hot in there , good thing Social Distortion made it all worth while through their music and < PROPFIRST > Ness fucking with the woman from Detroit . 
Rediscovered my love of the Tuba , dear god I do hate Youtube so much for having videos of everything non-Pornographic you could possibly want . 
Some weeks I have to wonder if we get togather for D&D or just to < PROPFEMALE > out . 
GO PACKERS ! 
Almost time to get wasted . 
Why aren't you mother fuckers at this party ? I'm drinking Rumpleminz 
Party at Chaz's house , lots of booze . I'm pretty wasted . 
To all those who knew < PROPMALE > the Pug , he's passed on around 2AM in my arms . He's gone home to be with his family . Goodbye bug , miss you . 
Good to know that no matter what happens in my life there is one universal constant . The Lions will always suck . 
01/23/10 < PROPMALE > , OH Peabody's The Expendables . Who's with me ? 
Mmmm cobbler . 
Hell yeah , Packers are gonna take this one to the bank . Fucking love < PROPFIRST > Rodgers 
Happy New Years Everyone . 
Really excited about FNM tonight . ElfDrazi is complete now , and running pretty smoothly . 
The Expendables new CD is going to have a song called Donkey Show or The Donkeys Last Waltz or something like that . Sounds bad ass so far . 
Wish I knew what was going on tonight ... Anyone know what the plans are ? 
Oh hot damn , A Virgin named < PROPFIRST > . 
Got my ticket for Winter Blackout 2010 at Peabodies , they're only $16 at ticketmaster . So I ask you , who's coming with me ? 
Apparently tonight is Magic Night ... 
\Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be . Be one . \ " < PROPMALE > Aurelius " 
Real men watch Disney Movies . 
This First Shift shit sucks ... 
\I told you my biggest fear was losing people and part of me wonders if you'll consider that when you leave me . \"" 
Less than 12 hours till Winter Blackout 2010 
T-minus 7.5 hours 
And we're off to see the show . 
Show romped , tomorrow is going to suck . Bruised leg , sore back and shoulder , and back to the First Bullshit . 
Looking at Kilt's online . 
Quick , someone ask me what's up ? 
97% of teens would cry if they saw < PROPFIRST > Lautner ( < PROPMALE > from Twilight ) standing on top of a sky scraper , about to jump . If you're one of the 3% who would sit there eating pop corn screaming \DO A BARRELROLL ! \ " then copy and paste this as your status ! " 
Would you rather be able to fly , or have the ability to read people's minds ? 
Off to the Worldwake Pre Release Party ! Come on War Callers ! 
\God gave us memories so we might enjoy Roses in December . \ " - J . M . < PROPFEMALE > " 
Have you ever loved someone so much that as soon as they left your side you missed them ? As soon as they walked out the door it felt like someone had removed your heart ? 
I am Lobster Man ! 
Getting excited , 1 week to Extended PTQ ! 
Super Bowl Sunday , Go Aints ! Down with the Colts ! 
Why is it every time you want to trust someone they do everything in their power to sabotage it ? 
When you grab a hold of me . Tell me that I'll never be set free . 
Note to other < PROPMALE > Cain's we need to start a group for < PROPMALE > Cains . 
Just about time to roll for FNM with White Eldrazi . We'll see how she plays . 
So , judging from the first Eldrazi Spell spoiled from RoE Holy God am I ever gonna use the Eldrazi ! 
So , I totally just got a SC2 Beta Invite . 
Please Nigga , you be darker than Port Au-Prince . 
Ramy was the little spoon ! 
Everyone who thinks they know something about economics should really watch this movie , it's called \The Last Truck : Closing of a GM Plant \"." 
Sweet , made Top 4 at Legacy playing Jenkarator . 
Anyone interested in the Starcraft 2 Beta let me know , I have one invite . 
So , went to the Extended PTQ San < PROPFIRST > today , finished last after 7 rounds ... At least I didn't drop . 
Attempting to read < PROPMALE>'s Divine Comedy . Seems alright so far , very confusing . 
“Believers , Jews , Sabaeans or Christians - whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does what is right - shall have nothing to fear or regret . ” Unknown section of The Quran . 
\Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? \"" 
Captian < PROPMALE > is climbing a Mountian . Why is he climbing a Mountain ? 
Ready to fuckin release my exhaustion and nerd rage on the face of the next person I see . 
The apprentice is tired , and is off to bed . The lovely Xena was beautiful to work with this evening . 
The Theory of the Multiverse says , There are infinite parallel universes , Containing every possible situation . It make me happy , Because I know , Somewhere , You love me back . 
So , are we playing D&D Tomorrow ? Anyone know ? If you know shoot me a message or comment on this one . 
Oh my god . I'm so drunk right now . 
That was a surprisingly good film . How to Train Your Dragon - 4.5 / 5 
I really wish this song would stop playing over and over in my head ... 
Going to Indy for a few days . Leaving in probably about an hour . Gonna be awesome . 
put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone)who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2010 is that people willunderstand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamedof . Dragons are nearly unstoppable andare truly terrifying . 93% won'tcopy and paste this . 
Tossing Legacy Ideas around for the 2010 < PROPMALE > Grand Prix . Anyone got any ideas ? 
If you ' like ' this status , I will post on your wall something I like about you . Make this your status if you want a challenge . 
Off to Colossal Con ! 
Colossalcon 9 has become known as Tornadocon , I personally shall refer to it as Colossal-ocalypse . 
Feeling quite blah today . 
Remember that time Bini won a play set of Force of Wills by shitting all over < PROPMALE>' cheerios . 
New phone is awesome . I love my HTC Hero . 
Why is the fair not over yet ? 
Tear down day has finally come to the Trumbull county fair . So glad to have made it out the side of the fair with out any < PROPMALE > injuries once more . 
To all veterans of the US armed forces , thank you for your service and happy Independence day . 
So , forty minutes from the GP < PROPMALE > . Expect sporadic updates . 
The new Jitte < PROPMALE > is awesome . Must st < PROPMALE > running Jittes now . 
Well , I guess that could have gone worse . It would have been nice to not get wrecked in the PTQ and the GP . 
Today is Tuesday at the Ashtabula county fair . That means 5 more days at this fair before my 5 days off then the longest two weeks of the season . 
So , right now N.Y.C. has the < PROPMALE > to prove that we are a nation of tolerance and acceptance even after 9/11/01 but instead they're proving that discrimination 
Welp . Lived through another one . Two fairs down , four to go . 
Well , fair season is half over . Tomorrow starts the biggest fair of the season , The Canfield fair . Running the Zahurak's fry trailer . 
One day gone , the second half way over . God I hate the Canfield Fair . 
9 years after 9/11/01 , many years later and many deaths later , what has changed ? Instead of learning to accept people and trying to improve the world we've lost our openness . 
So , < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World is epic . 
< PROPFEMALE > call < PROPFIRST > so I can sleep . 
Iration is coming back to < PROPMALE > ! So pumped , totally gonna go see it . December 4th or something like that . 
Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill gowithout treatment . Troops go without the proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised to them !!! Yet we donate millions to other countries before helping our own first !!! 1% will re-post and ... 99% of people on Facebook won't have the bal ...... ls ~

Just a quick poll for you Facebook hoard , which is more important Rocks or Hammers ? 
Why ? Why is it always me who gets stuck as the comrade in kings ? It never ends well . 
I officially now understand why FourLoko is illegal . 
Today is the 69th Anniversary of the bombing of < PROPFEMALE > Harbor . Let us hold a moment of silence in memorial of all those who died defending our home land . 
Well , the character sheets and system and such are done for my Camp Half-Blood RPG . My first NPC character is done , and The Great Prophecy is done . The main baddie is set . Soon we shall have a tale told to rival those of the greatest in history when The Seven face their fate . 
A normal person has 1,000 wishes . A soldier only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died , a wounded warrior , or who is fighting for your freedom , please repost in their honor 
WTF is up with people posting random shit with < PROPFIRST > at the front ? 
TO ALL MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS !!! Will you all be willing to donate your status for just a few minutes to HONOR a fallen < PROPFEMALE > who's just passed away while serving our country ? Cpl . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( USMC ) died Dec 6 while serving in Afghanistan . He leaves behind a wife and a newborn son named in his honor , who was born approx 24 hours after news of his death . Repost to honor this Hero and his family 
A question for the party . Shall we be playing tonight or tomorrow night ? Achmed's or Satyrs ? 
Mmm Whiskey Nog and Kings . 
Just about done making some Chicken Noodle Soup for Achmed the Sick Terrorist . 
To The Usual Suspects : When are we playing the RPG this week ? Where are we playing ? How many people are going to be playing ? 
That's a new definition of Moonsault 
Monster < PROPMALE > Tri , you have so many things I love , but where oh where are my gun lances and hunting horns ? 
\A snotty little poem about fiber . \ " - Achmed " 
When are people getting here for New Years ? 
So , how special does it make me that between < PROPMALE > and I we've had a whole pot of tea and we're half way through Oklahoma . 
Less than 7 hours from PTQ 
Didn't go to Indy , won one hand in 5 rounds , ate < PROPMALE > food . Could have been a worse day all in all . 
Clean out the Fridge Chutney <3<3 
Final Score : Green Bay Packers : 21 - Chicago Bears : 14 . I stand by the fact that the Packers win the Superbowl by 3 points . 
Come on Jets . a Field Goal with 9 seconds left of the first half is not gonna get you to the super bowl . 
Ladies and gentlemen , < PROPMALE > officially thinks I'm fucked up ... WICKED ! 
Doesn't make much sense , does it ?? : Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'm in the 1% 
My old friend < PROPFIRST > posted this and damn it's amazing , \Consider this : no less than 5.9 million years have collectively been spent playing the online game World of Warcraft since it was released in 2004 .

We're closing on the concert . Wednesday will not get here soon enough . 
I believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this 
I may have to go to Korea and burn SDEnternet to the ground . 
Less than 24 hours to Less Than < PROPMALE > at the < PROPMALE > HoB . 
Absolutely epic result to a quiz I took . \ 
Male Best Friend : A woman has a close male friend . This means that he is probably interested in her , which is why he hangs around so much . She sees him strictly as a friend . This always starts out with , you're a great guy , but I don't like you in that way . 
When you hold your pistol sideways , you are using thug aim . 
Less Than < PROPMALE > is 16 hours away ! SO PUMPED ! 
Awesome Video Game Idea : Ska Band . Guitar , Drums , Trobone/Trumpet , Sax . It might just make millions . 
Less than 4 hours till the show . Lets rock this town to death . Less Than < PROPMALE > , The Supervillians , Off With Their Heads and from < PROPMALE > , Ohio Reverse The Curse . Please don't make my town suck guys . 
So , ran out of gas . Got pushed 2 < PROPMALE > by a Bay Village Cop , at 35 . Then did a Drift in his cruiser around the front of the car , and took off . Concert was Epic , so freaking sore . 
I love a good System Wipe . Makes the machine run like new again . So much faster . 
Also , I can't wait to see them again ! Awesome awesome awesome show . 
Enjoying an Ice Cold Coors Light . 
just learned about a little game called status hijacking . 
Packers are totally gonna whoop all up on the Steelers today . 
It's almost time for the Packers to win the Superbowl ! 
Put this as your status if you know somebody who suffers from being a Pittsburgh Steelers Fan . Being a Steelers fan is a real disorder and is no laughing matter . This should be taken very seriously . There is no known cure for PSF and sympathy does not help .... but we can raise awareness ..... 90% of Steelers fans won't repost this because ..... they don't know how to copy and paste .. 
What's that ? Packers win ? Didn't I hear someone saying they were gonna get stomped ? Guess what , we whooped y'all! 
The speed at which dishes pile up is amazing .

A man walks into a bar , sits down , and asks for a glass of water . The bar tender pulls out a shotgun , and fires it barely missing the man . The man thanks and tips the bartender , leaving with a smile . Why ? 
Just got back from the 5 day trip to Washington D.C. It was amazing . 
While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man trying to flirt with her and hoping to remind her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there's a man wanting to steal smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you are against Domestic Violence 
Excitment and abject horror do not go well together .
