What's up people , just got a new face book , thought I'd check it out . 

\A man must know his < PROPFEMALE > . if he does not \ 
Ugh I'm still sick and really tired . I don't think that I can face school today , but I guess that I have no other choice . T_T 
Im over at Emiley's , she sick again , going to go to the school in a bit to get her work , see ya at school , losers ! XD 
I have a job interview at 2:00 with Shaw , Im so excited ! 
At home messing around with something called SVN , takes forever to learn how to use it but well worth the wait . 
Got back from AWA last night , ill be uploading some pics soon , god I am tired ! 
Over at Emiley's , getting ready to eat dinner with her grandparents and then its off to Soddy < PROPFEMALE > for two days . 
Why does she have to make me feel like crap every < PROPMALE > she gets ? 
I just wish there was something I could do to get her back . I feel like I'm falling apart piece by piece and there is nothing that will help me now . I'm like the old , broken toy that is being thrown away , and who'll not matter once i've been replaced . 
I feel sick .... 
Got a cashier job at Bi Lo . Woot . 
Ive finally given up . Not just for her , but for hope that Ill ever be happy again . in fact , for how much she's hurt me , I hope i am NEVER happy again , less it just be a repeat of history . Anything she's told any of you about me probably doesn't have a ring of truth to it . She is a cold , horrible person and Ive come to realize this . if any of you are wondering something , feel free to ask and ill tell you . 
You know , I feel better talking to some friends i haven't seen in awhile , and I still care about her , its just I would never consider being with her again unless she changes for the better . I just hope she doesn't get hurt ... 
You know , you shouldn't just ' give up ' when things seem bad for you . Its a sign of weakness and the last thing you need to be is weak . Don't just give up because a relationship didn't turn out like you planned . Go and do what makes you happy , don't think about it anymore and BE HAPPY ! There are much more important things than a relationship this early in life . 
She has the idea that she's hopeless and that no one can help her stuck in her head . For now , im giving up on trying to help when she won't let me help her . For now , im just going to move on and try to find someone else to spend my time and effort on who deserves it . 
Over at < PROPFIRST>'s , man we had fun at the fair ! cold as hell though and my jacket rubbed my left nipple raw lol . 
Had fun over at < PROPFIRST>'s , we woke up and watched the fly 2 and the < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show Before I left , man I needed those laughs ! 
About to head out to Varnell to get some gas and food , hit me up if your nearby and wanna < PROPFEMALE > out . 
Back from the trip from Varnell , Damn the rest of today is going to suck , I have absolutely nothing to do ! ARGH !

* SEIZURE * 
Hmm . I havew repeatedly seen the words ' World War III ' and ' Nuclear Holocaust ' several times , but now that I look , when reading news reports about N . Korea , they usually call us and South Korea the ' Allies ' . Wolrd War III it is . You all know what that means . 
Just realized we never signed a peace treaty with North Korea , which means technically the Korean War never ended offically , which means Congress cannot ' Declare War ' on North Korea , because we already have , example : from Wikipedia on the conclusion of the Korean War : Armistice , 1953 where a Cease Fire was signed . A peace treaty was never signed with North Korea after annual attempts , never officially ending the War . 
Just got done putting together my new computer desk , god good desks are a pain to put together , took me most of today and all this afternoon till now ! UGH ! TIME WAISTING DESK ! But it is nice . lol . 
GO TO A SKINHEAD RALLY , PREACH ABOUT THE ZOHAN AND WHY HE SHOULDNT BE MESSED WITH ! 
Its offical , my new nickname is the Army Armageddon , seans is the War < PROPFEMALE > , now we just need an air force guy to be the Air Force Annihilator and a navy person to be the Navy Napalm ! 
Close friend counter time ! Everyone who would consider me a close friend , leave a note saying something good about another friend ! I want to see if we can't make a chain ! 
FML ... 
Playin some halflife on the ps2 , fixes all emotional issues with good ole fashioned gaming ! 
* sigh * ... 
Und der Haifisch , der hat Tränen\ 
Und die laufen vom Gesicht , \ 
doch der Haifisch lebt im Wasser -\ 
so die Tränen sieht man nicht .... 
In der Tiefe ist es einsam\ 
und so manche Zähre fliesst\ 
und so kommt es , dass das Wasser\ 
in den Meeren salzig ist . 
Anyone to hangout before we get stuck indoors tomorrow ? 
Ok , time to do some friend-scaping , if you dont hate me , and want to keep me as a friend , like this or comment on this status , if not , goodbye , im deleting you , any questions ? 
Time for a funny ' WWII germans having fun in the snow ' photo compilation ! 
Watching The Eagle has landed right now , I love old World War II movies ! The < PROPFEMALE > guy in this movie is f**king hilarious ! 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BORED ! * Shoots self * 
Another day , another onslaught of snow . Someone please shoot me . >_< 
Woke up 12 this morning , my parents are gone and I dont know where they went , no note , plus they wont answer their phones , perfect , now im trapped at home alone with nothing to do except go shooting I guess , better than sitting around , if I dont come back , dont bother calling an ambulance , it wont make it in time . >_< 
Dammit , why does life have to be so stressful !? How do they expect me at work for the last two days in this and not tell me ? And now , they want me in tomorrow ? my family only has one vehicle that can run around in this , and what happens when I have to go to school tomorrow ? Are they going fire me because I have more important things to do ?! I cant afford to not work right now , I dont even have but $20 to my name ! 
Just watched Miracle At St < PROPFEMALE > , damn good movie , makes you wanna cry at the end . 
Love is the glue of the universe , not hatred . 
DRINK POWERTHIRST , SHOOT THE CLOUDS ! HIT JESUS ! STRAP HIM TO A BULL !!! JESUS-RODEO , DEAD-JESUS-RODEO ! JESUS-RODEO , DEAD-JESUS-RODEO !!! 
UGH !! IM BORED !!! SOMEBODY TALK TO ME !! A < PROPFIRST > ON THE HEAD WILL SUFFICE !!! Man , could I ever sound more like someones pets ' thoughts ? 
Well , almost crashed into the lake trying to get out of the house , guess im stuck here after all ... 
I aM A gOd , I aM mAcHiNe ... 
Sometimes , I wish it were still acceptable by society to kill idiots and people that have wronged you as long as you drug them into the town square first . Eh , maybe I am a bit too old fashioned . 
AAAHHHH , I hate Draft Lettering . T^T 
Watching Pulp Fiction , god I love this movie ! I actually got a full 12 hours of sleep last night , im at least glad to be blessed with that ability ! 
Eating some Bratwurst , watching a Foreign Horror movie , cant think of a better way to end a slow day at home . 
So much time left this week , yet now that I look at my schedule , I have no more time to sleep with all the work Im going to have to finish early for drill this weekend , then its right back to work , school , work , school , and no time to sleep to speak of . Yet , its not even what I would call the least of my problems anymore .... * sigh * I miss that comfort I used to have .... 
Downloading AutoCAD software for class so I can finish some work , looks like its going to take a few hours , Sleepy Time ! 
I think ive had it wrong all along , you can't be a 100% good person , every now and then , you have to get your hands dirty to survive . I think I finally realize what I needed to do . Be less honest , theres a reason chivilary is dead . 
I dont give 2 s**ts what you think of me . \ima friend-of-a-friend whos going to teach you something\ " isnt going to get you far when the so-called \ " bad guy\ " kills you for threatening them over something you have no business in the first place . Be the first to actually offer to sit down and talk about the problem you have with a person you've only heard about first . It saves lives and the tears of mothers . " 
Well , time to shower and get packed , then in 4 hours i get to go to Drill ! Yay for pay ! 
See you guys sunday ! Ill miss you ! 
Wierd how sore I was this morning from drill , then I go to the gym for 2 1/2 hours , and now im not sore anymore ?! LOL ! Exercise for the win ! 
Going to sleep to the Pink < PROPMALE > song Shine on you crazy < PROPFEMALE > , damn good song , good night everyone ! 
Uggh ... I don't feel good ... throats sore and now im sore all over again ... 
To know that someone cheated on you over ten times after the breakup , makes you wonder if you found out before you broke up if theyd still be alive ... 
At the school , just finished class , waiting for < PROPMALE > to finish at that play with everyone else so I can give him his laptop back . Its nice and quiet here , a good place for day dreaming . 
Ugh ... sick today , got a crappy pay check that wont last me even a week , not getting one next week , had to skip out on the roller rink with friends tonight , and now i just found out ill have to skip the paintball trip tomorrow because i have no money to go . FML 
Die Zeichen stehen gut für dieses eine Mal traurig-Hai ! ^_^ 
Just got back from wal mart with < PROPFIRST > bought him a new cell phone charger and i bought the Us Army zombie combat skills book , and then we picked up an airsoft m4 and colt 1911 for $30 , good thing i still have the receipt . 
God i feel sick , but i guess theres no rest for the college student , i have a test today and i have to start an essay .... i just wish i could take a week off , i hate my life right now for being so busy . 
... Been surrounded for so long , yet never felt so alone ... 
Vater unser im Himmel , \ 
geheiligt werde dein Name ;\ 
dein Reich komme ;\ 
dein Wille geschehe , \ 
wie im Himmel so auf Erden . \ 
Unser tägliches Brot gib uns heute . \ 
Und vergib uns unsere Schuld , \ 
wie auch wir vergeben unsern Schuldigern ;\ 
und führe uns nicht in Versuchung , \ 
sondern erlöse uns < PROPMALE > dem Bösen . \ 
\ 
Denn dein ist das Reich und die Kraft\ 
und die Herrlichkeit in Ewigkeit . \ 
Amen .

Stuck on my Essay , while listening to Solitary Man . What horrible timing , < PROPFIRST > Cash playlist . * sigh * 
Another sleepless night . Thanks , college work . 
Goodbye , V-day . Im going to sleep and ignore you for another year and pretend you were just another bad dream . 
Wierd what you find while cleaning the car out .. I REALLY hate this day now ..

I < PROPMALE > my head .... I < PROPMALE > my head ... 
Well , it happened again . I spilled myself all over to someone to try to get a reaction , and I again get told im useless and stupid . oh well ... just another bad day anyway . 
Going to nap a bit before i have to get up for school . seems like i never get sleep every monday and wednesday . 
Finally back home , cant wait for this weekend if all goes to plan . 
Listening to DeUtScHlAnD NuMbEr 1 whilst killing tanks in WoT . A great way to end a Thursday !

Wore the East < PROPMALE > soldier outfit today , and the wool pants got excruciating because i wore a tight belt and it has buttons in the waistline that were digging into my hips , so i told < PROPFIRST > on the way home something so funny its now one of my new catchphrases : First thing im going to do when i get home is take off my pants and get on the computer . first thing < PROPFIRST > said was : \Say that again ? \ " and we laughed so hard XD " 
So you are going to play the ' pity me ' card like you always do , huh ? This isn't some game where you go and make shit up and call it you . THIS IS REAL FUCKING LIFE . That's no excuse to lie about EVERYTHING . There is nothing wrong with your surroundings , its all you making it seem that way . I AM TIRED of you bothering those in my life . Do yourself a favor and stop harrassing people for once . 
St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day Comment : A Day where you have to wear green ? Whatever , IM A GREEN , MEAN , KILLING MACHINE !!! I DONT GIVE A F**K !!! 
Just tried out Cleverbot for the first time , and now im fearing for my life . Should i tell it my name , or does it already know !? 
So , what do you know of the beautiful language of < PROPMALE > then , ' Clever ' bot ? \ 
It is the force of attraction between all masses in the universe . \ 
Damn straight . \ 
-Conversation with cleverbot . 
Is your name Summer ? \ 
Weve been over this , Cleverbot . My name is not Summer . \ 
Sorry . \ 
Its ok , an easy mistake for a Machine . \ 
Ok . \ 
So what sort of questions do you get most , Cleverbot ? \ 
I don't often meet people . The multitudes of you are the only new people I've met in a long while . \ 
And how does that make you feel ? \ 
Weird that I'm up at 1:17 am talking to a computer . \ 
OMG WTF LMAO 
Ok , now cleverbot is starting to get dark and scary O.o :\ 
You asked what your name is ? \ 
Yeah and at first before that I asked if you were a real person and you said yess if you are a real person I need to know right now because if you're not than the FBI have to get ivolved . \ 
What the hell ? \ 
I am very aware that you want to help me live again . 
OMG ! Cleverbot is a person ! : \ 
What do you know about me ? \ 
I know you are a computer program run off of perhaps serveral computers and maybe a supercomputer and you are a learning program that picks things up from its enviorment . \ 
I am human . \ 
You are human ? What is your name then ? \ 
I am not prepared to discuss such intimate matters with you at this time . 
Off of my list of things to do before I die : Pshyc out Cleverbot . :\ 
But you just said and I quote ' I have memories and coherent thought . That should be proof enough that I am ot machine . ' . \ 
I never said that . \ 
Its right 4 posts above this . Seriously , you just said that . \ 
No I did not . You are annoying as hell ! \ 
Why ? Because I prove you wrong all the time ? 
... and now the cleverbot is speaking Chinese , ok , cleverbot , you win . 
Are you a Nazi , Cleverbot ? \ 
No ! I am not a robot ! \ 
Are you a Nazi though ? \ 
Just a little bit . My great great grandfather was part Cherokee \ 
Nevermind , cleverbot loses , once again XD 
Because you said you were a Nazi . I hate Nazis . \ 
When did I say that ? \ 
Are you a Nazi ? \ 
Yes . \ 
Just now you said it . \ 
Fail XD 
Are you Hitler ? \ 
Not yet . \ 
Tell me , what do you know about World War II ? \ 
I like Putin . \ 
wow . 
Early one morning\ 
With time to kill\ 
I borrowed Jebb's rifle\ 
And sat on a hill\ 
I saw a lone rider\ 
Crossing the plain\ 
I < PROPFIRST > a bead on him\ 
To practice my aim\ 
My brother's rifle \ 
Went off in my hand\ 
A shot rang out\ 
Across the land\ 
The horse , he kept running\ 
The rider was dead\ 
I < PROPMALE > my head\ 
I < PROPMALE > my head 
Ugh . Boring weekend .

Hopefully , this weekend and next week are as event filled as well , good night people of Facebook !
