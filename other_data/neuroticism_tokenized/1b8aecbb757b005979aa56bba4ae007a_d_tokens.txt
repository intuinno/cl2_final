Two things for today : 1 . I have perhaps the handsomest man in the whole world for a husband . ( Just needed to brag a little ) , and 2 . Hold me accountable guys . I am trying to lose 30 lbs . by my birthday in September . I am exercising 5 times/week and watching what I eat . I have set short and long term goals for myself with rewards for meeting them . Hold me to it . I need as much support as I can get . 

Happy Memorial Day ! Regardless of your feelings regarding those currently holding poitical office , we ALL can thank the men and women serving this country in the Armed Forces . Without the sacrifices they and their families make , none of us could enjoy days like today . If you don't like the current situation , move or get more involved . Change requires action . Thank to all those who have or currently are serving . 
Finally losing some weight !!!! Yay !!!! 
Date night with my Man !!!!! New dress ; check , make-up ; check , entirely too much cleavage for one little dress ; check . Should be one for the records ( I've got my fingers crossed ) . 
Spent the day in Bar Harbor with the kiddos while we waited for my handsome guy to get done at work . Heard music in the Village Green , ate ice cream at < PROPFIRST > Meadow , and < PROPFEMALE > made a friend . All in all not a bad day !!

What a rough , or should I say L-O-U-D , couple of days it's been . < PROPFEMALE > is now one , and mean ol ' Momma took ba-ba ( translated : bottle ) away . A red-headed < PROPFEMALE > baby + the combined temper of < PROPFIRST > and I = record breaking tantrums . Sorry Baby Sis ! As for the rest of us ; music/movies to drown out the whining , and a glass of wine and a good book ( for Momma and Daddy ) as far away from her room as possible at bed time . 
Thanks to all for the warm birthday wishes ! 
Some days aren't even worth getting out of bed :( 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! I'm busy baking , cleaning , & preparing for a wonderful holiday feast . Wanted to wish all my fb family & friends a great day . A special thanks to my brothers < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > , who will be spending this Thanksgiving in Afghanistan defending their country . Thank you to their families ; Sato , Renoa , < PROPFIRST > , & < PROPFIRST > , too , for the daily sacrifices they make . Love you guys . 
Today I discoverd a movie that took me through the broadest range of emotions I've ever experienced from one film . I strongly reccomend Dear Zachary : A Letter to a Son about His Father . If this film doesn't touch your heart , check your pulse ! P.S. It's not suitable for children .
