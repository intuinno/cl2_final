I have to be awake in 6 hours . I'm about to watch a 2 hour movie . That sounds like a great idea . :D 
had a good Easter brunch . And a good time last night . ;) 
I command my dominion . Every heart and all opinion . 
I remember one of the things I don't miss about high school now : Having to wake up this early . 
Since when has < PROPMALE > Meloy tried to be like < PROPFIRST > Stipe ? 
Can't wait for the deluxe edition of Year of the Black Rainbow to arrive . 
I need ideas for movies to watch that are similar to/as awesome as Fight Club . Any help ? 
I'm the shallow , the superficial . I'm the common man . Faithless , narrow-minded , indifferent , impassive . A sycophantic leech . Tantamount to disintegrity . I'm the vulture feeding on malignancy . 
Year of the Black Rainbow is streaming on Coheed's Myspace . So glad I ordered the deluxe edition now . :D 
feels really confused ... :/ 
Today's going to be a great day . :) I can feel it . 
Some people need to grow up . Seriously . 
Souls at Zero is a great album . Just sayin ' . 
has leftover pizza thanks to my parents . 
My grandpa turned 71 today , work was better than I thought it would be tonight , and I got < PROPFEMALE>'s for dinner . I think that makes today a good day . 
13 days until Porcupine Tree . 
was born in ' 67 , the year of \Sgt . Pepper\ " and \ " Are You Experienced\ " . It was a suburb of heaven . Yeah and it would have been forever . It all seemed to make so much sense . " 
Had to clean at work today , and some kind of liquid dripped all over my one arm from a trash bag . But now I'm showered so it's all good . 
Since today is Earth Day , remember to eat your beets . Or don't eat your beets . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2n45Sutwig 
It's only a number . It's only a death . Another solider died in action the telegram regrets . 8 days .

Ugh , work today . But then Porcupine Tree concert tonight ! :D 
Is off to see Porcupine Tree with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . 
Loved the Porcupine Tree concert . Might be my favorite concert ever . 
While < PROPFIRST > Tillman is the best brother/friend I could ask for , he drives me nuts sometimes lol . 
Owes an apology to a friend . And I don't really give a damn if anyone else tells me not to do it anymore . It'll make me feel better if I do it . 
1 exam down and 3 to go . 
Exams , work , and ( maybe ) a moment of truth today . Fun fun fun . 
No moment of truth today . Hopefully it happens another day soon . Just 2 more exams tomorrow and I'm done for the summer . 
Hopefully everyone had a good Cinco de Mayo . And more importantly , I'd like to wish < PROPFIRST > Townsend a happy 38th . 
I'm now done with school !... until July . 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding tomorrow ! :) 
Cleaning my room while singing along/dancing to Coheed and Cambria . Can't wait for the wedding tonight ! 
Had a good time with family tonight . But now that I'm on summer break with nothing to do but work , I feel like my life is in a bit of a rut . But I'll figure it out . 
Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful moms out there . Especially to mine , one of the sweetest and kindest people I know . 
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate ? 
I can't be angry , even if I wanted to be , and I forgive easily . That's just the kind of person I am . If you need someone to count on , I'm the one . :) And it's way too easy to judge people without knowing what they have to struggle with every day . 
Had a good time with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . And I got a nice book on Radiohead too ! 
Now works 36 1/2 hours this week . Yay ? 
No ma'am . I can't take this 50 cent coupon even if it's a matter of life and death to you because I like keeping my job . You can go fuc-I mean have a nice day ! :) 
Had a good time at < PROPFIRST>'s today . And I finally won at Battleship . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dio . The world of rock and metal will never forget what you've done for them . 
has been really tired lately from working too much . But only 4 more days until Mastodon concert ! 
saw a Kroger cart by the Thorton's on < PROPFEMALE > as I was driving home from working out . How did it get that far ? 
Just found out < PROPFEMALE > broke up . First Dio dies , and now this . :( 
is going to see Mastodon tonight with < PROPFEMALE > Dawson . 
If anyone doesn't want to work on Tuesday , let me know . I could use a few more hours this week . 
This makes me think 2 things : 1 ) I'm worried about it being overhyped and 2 ) I'm probably still going to like Super < PROPFIRST > World and Super < PROPFIRST > 64 more . http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/plugged-in/new-mario-verdict-in-tricky-but-could-be-the-best-yet/1399728 
can't believe that 24 is over now . :( And who knows how long we'll have to wait for the movie ? 
is seeing Converge tonight with < PROPFEMALE > Dawson and < PROPFIRST > Tillman . 
The Converge concert last night was amazing beyond description . Easily one of my top 3 concerts ever . 
is now working 6-midnight today . You owe me one , Christian . :P 
now works every day this week except Tuesday . Let's see how long I go before I pass out from exhaustion . 
is reading a book on Radiohead while listening to Radiohead . 
There is no way you can love her like I do . Oh no . There is no way I see through you . 
thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Rosh , all carts shall hereafter be referred to as \whoas \"." 
I'm just going to go ahead and say it : \Revolution 9\ " is the best thing The Beatles ever did . " 
Slept like crap last night . At least I don't have to work today and just have my night class . 
Easily my favorite song off of their new album . This would have made my top 10 albums of 2009 if I'd heard it last year . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcReRA4vhBw 
http://churchmousec.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/postmodernism-sbcimpactnet.jpg 
Katatonia is absolutely brilliant . That is all . 
Home from work and showered all my sweat off . Going to see < PROPMALE > of Persia with < PROPFIRST > tonight . :) 
I hope it's at least somewhat cooler today at work than it was yesterday . 
is tired of pretending to be okay with talking about people behind their backs . 
Watching N . Korea v . Brazil . If N . Korea wins I'll die of laughter . 
No work today , and no studying either . :D 
Can't sleep . My mind is way too active right now . 
Work until midnight tonight and 11 tomorrow night . Fun and more fun . :D 
Tired . So glad I have the next 2 days off of work . 
currently has anywhere from 3-7 concerts for the rest of 2010 . :D 
does not want to work today . 
Customer tonight : \Do you need my watermelon out ? \ " \ 
Meshuggah , Converge , and Between the Buried and Me make most other metal bands look like fools . 
My parents are getting me Five Guys and I don't have to show my face at Kroger until Friday . Good times . :D 
now has a checking account , will be getting approved for a credit card soon , and ( hopefully ) helped out someone at work . 
All that we can do is just survive . All that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive . 
thinks he may have underestimated High on Fire . They were awful live but Snakes for the Divine is a LOT better than I thought it would be . 
Some of the little kids in the neighborhood have a lemonade stand on the corner of the street across from us . That takes me back ... 
had a REALLY good evening ! :D 
Should not have been up this late . Oh well . Good night world . 
So out air conditioning isn't working properly . I'd hope it gets fixed before tomorrow , but it's probably not going to be likely . 
really needs someone to take either my Monday ( cashier 4-8 ) or Wednesday ( cashier 2:15 - 7:45 ) shift or trade me a Friday shift if at all possible . 
as a wise man I know often says , \F**k you 3AM \"." 
Happy Independence Day ! 
Congrats to Nadal for his second Wimbledon title and 8th Grand Slam Championship . 
My 5 week Accounting class from hell starts tomorrow and I'm already stressed about it , despite having spent almost 5 hours studying already . 
<3 ' s Minus the Bear 
Handle with kid gloves handle with kid gloves . Then you learn the lessons taught in school won't be enough . 
wants to know why he keeps getting invites to raves in Lexington ... :/ 
Life is working out quite well lately . Now if I only didn't have school this summer ... 
is most likely going to see The Dear < PROPMALE > , Circa Survive , and Coheed & Cambria in < PROPMALE > on August 27 with my brother . And only 2 days before the Rush concert too . :D Anyone else want to go ? 
thinks it's hilarious that so many people are upset with Lebron's decision . 
Like\ 
this status and I'll post one thing about you that I like , dislike , \ 
love and want to confess no matter how close we are or aren't . Then copy\ 
and paste this as your status . 
Work today , then big plans tonight . :) 
has decided that dating girls isn't really his thing because they suck ( no offense to the ones who are family or friends ) . And since I'm not interested in guys , I'm going to just stay single and adopt a monkey . The worst thing that happens there is it gets angry , hoots and hollars , and throws bananas at me . XD 
Charlieeeeeeeeeeeeee ! We're going on an adventure Charlieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! 
Is going to start the \H&D Canned Sandwich Corporation\ " with < PROPMALE > High . " 
Alex : ( Tax Accounting ) just was dense and confusing . And A LOT to take in . \ 
Me : That's what she said . 
Ken : \What is this ? \ " * Grabs an extendable 
< PROPFIRST > Browne is the best Accounting tutor ever . 
Exploring Buckethead's discography is like a box of chocolates . 
Good news : I don't work today . \ 
Bad news : I have an Accounting test Monday , but I have < PROPFIRST > helping me study . 
enjoyed Toy Story 3 with < PROPFIRST > Tillman , < PROPFIRST > Browne , < PROPFEMALE > Tillman , and < PROPFIRST > Kamp . :) 
I saw a lady today who looked like she was at least 70 buy lube at work today . I felt dirty bagging it ... :/ 
has been working for Kroger for one year as of today . Oh , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > too , but whatever . :P 
is enjoying his free cupcake from Kroger . 
So far , today has sucked . I missed my alarm and was 20 minutes late to Accounting , I did some stupid stuff on that test and only got an 83 , and I don't really understand this Stats homework that we're getting quizzed over tonight . Here's hoping the rest of the day is a bit better . 
Slaps < PROPMALE > High with a large smelly tuna fish . 
I'll be done with Stats after tomorrow night . Then only 2 more weeks of Accounting ! Yay ! :D 
I think the purpose of younger brothers is simply to embarrass , shame , and annoy older siblings . I have yet to find another reason for why they exist . 
Is done with Stats 212 YES ! :) That leaves 2 more weeks of Accounting . :( 
Looks like my life is probably going to change significantly within the next few weeks or months . :( But it's not my fault . I will struggle through and persevere . 
On a happier note though , I helped train Zac Shaw on his first day as a cashier . :D 
My Accounting book is now attached to the front and back covers only by duct tape . Thanks Mythbusters for proving duct tape is good for almost anything ! :D 
My grandpa is in the middle of an emergency bypass surgery right now . Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers . 
My grandpa had to have 4 bypasses . The 2 aorta on his right side were 100% blocked . But he made it through that and the bleeding has stopped for the most part , so I think he's made it through the worst . 
My grandpa is now conscious and doesn't have a breathing tube in . He wasn't supposed to get that taken out for a good 2-3 days , so that's a REALLY good sign . :) 
I'd really like a day where I could sleep in . I miss those days . 
August already ? That means school starts soon . :( 
Today was soooooooo much better than yesterday . Too bad tomorrow is Accounting class then work for 8 hours then homework . 
Who knew a 3-piece contemporary jazz band could pull off interesting Nirvana covers ? 
\I'm pretty sure there's more to math careers than data entry . And I'm already a pseudo-emotionless computer bot ! \ " \ 
4 more days of Accounting for forever . 
is waiting for the axe to fall . 
It's 9 PM and still over 90 degrees outside ?! WHAT ?!?! 
Just ordered tickets to see Circa Survive , The Dear < PROPMALE > , and Coheed and Cambria on August 27th . 
is an evolutionary sleeper . 
IS DONE WITH ACCOUNTING FOREVER ! YES !!!!!! :) 
Leaving for vacation tomorrow . Woo ! 
Mom : \Aren't you getting dressed ? \ " \ 
The Other Guys is absolutely hilarious . 
Checked into our hotel . I really need this vacation . Gets me away from all the daily stresses . :) 
got an A in Accounting ! YESSSSSSS !!!! :D * Does a happy dance * 
\This is right up there with one of the weirder things we've had to do : Putting a dead chicken in a tanning booth . Ummmm ... Hello ? \ " < PROPFIRST > Hyneman " 
This might be the most relaxing vacation I've ever been on . I'm already starting to feel rejuvenated . 
I have to say I love northern Michigan's weather . To everyone back home ( and especially all you fools at Kroger who have to push carts :P ) , I do not envy you . 
My vacation ends tonight , but it was sooooo refreshing while it lasted . Back in NKY tomorrow . 
is back home and very tired . 
is singing like a girl . 
3D television and movies make as much sense as a Playstation IV controller . 
Today , I had the dumbest customer ever hands down . Took < PROPFIRST > and me almost 10 minutes to convince her that she wasn't getting charged extra for her onions . :/ 
Wow . Today really sucks . 
Sometimes I wish my parents would realize I'm not 12 anymore . 
I hate having insomnia . The one night where I decide I want to try to go to sleep early ... 
Alex : \Let's do Action Sack . \ " \ 
Horrible , horrible day at work today . Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong went wrong . Maybe some Halo 3 on Live will help me . 
Aqua Teen Hunger Force is amazing . That is all . 
would like to thank < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hoffman for allowing him to lose his club virginity . :D Goodnight world ! 
Today is my last day of summer vacation , and I get to spend it working !!! :D :D 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Gogh . Everyone told him , ' You only have one ear . You cannot\ 
be a great artist . ' And you know what he said ? ' I can't hear you . ' 
School starts tomorrow . Despite it being only 2 weeks since Accounting ended , I'm ready . 
First day of school today . Won't be done until 9 tonight , which sucks . 
will be seeing < PROPFIRST > Townsend November 5th in < PROPMALE > ! :D YES !!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D 
Wow . I missed a lot spending just one day away from the internet . Now I have to catch up .

is seeing Rush tonight with < PROPFIRST > Browne and < PROPFIRST > Tillman ! And more importantly , all of Moving Pictures ! 
May I take a nap instead of work today please ? :D 
Not a good day today at work . Although I think I can safely say < PROPFEMALE > had a worse customer than all of mine . 
I get to work my entire day away today . And I am not in a good mood about it . 
Despite having the worst day at Kroger ever , there are a few things we can take away from today : 1 ) Ice cream makes everything better . 2 ) The < PROPFEMALE > s are involved in various love triangles , and maybe squares/trapezoids (?) too . 3 ) Any < PROPFEMALE > s named < PROPFIRST > suck . :P 4 ) The most awesome < PROPFEMALE > ever , named after me of course , says \Yesssssss\ " and makes \ " that's what she said\ " jokes . " 
You are my angel . Come from way above to bring me love . 
likes when naps are so awesome that they cure headaches . 
enjoys leaving things at home that I need to do work at school . 
was mad about stuff at work , but my mom made me realize it's out of my control . So all I can do is my best . Thanks mom ! 
Congrats Nadal ! :) 
To all haters : Avenged Sevenfold is not as bad as you make them out to be . That is all .

Help I'm alive . My heart keeps beating like a hammer . Beating like a hammer . Beating like a hammer . Beating like a hammer . 
wants to protect his caterpillar from Kimbo Slice . 
Likes when the inside of Kroger is 80+ degrees . Hopefully that's the last time until next year that happens . 
Cincinnati-Oklahoma game tonight ! It will be either :D or :/ 
enjoyed the game , despite the fact that Oklahoma should have lost . Oh well . 
College students should not have to be awake this early . 
Is there a Humans vs . Zombies chapter/club that exists around here ? 
And the highlight of the day goes to < PROPFEMALE > Timmers . 
I would never read into this . Not at all ... http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/world/middleeast/30worm.html?_r=2 
Today is going to be a good day . You bet it is . :)

Chipotle : The cure for weary souls . 
Is going to the one big concert in the local area that is worth seeing today : Buckethead ! 
Tired , frustrated , and just generally pissed off . Awesome . 
Western-Southern and Fidelity resumes have both been submitted now . Now to cross my fingers that one falls through . 
5 DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN ! ( 1 ) FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when she knows she is right and you need to shut up . ( 2 ) NOTHING : means something & you need to be worried . ( 3 ) GO AHEAD : this is a dare , not permission , do not do it . ( 4 ) WHATEVER : A woman's way of saying screw you . ( 5 ) THAT'S OK : She is thinking long & hard on how and when you will pay for your mistake . Re-post if you agree . 
Working tonight = missing some of a party . :( 
Dear ocular migraine , \

Currently watching the Iowa GOP Debate . I think this pretty much settled that I'm voting for < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . Every other candidate really is just more of the same , a liar , or delusional . 
95% of the people who read this won't have the guts to re-post it . When Goku died in the explosion with Cell , he thought of both you and me . If you are part of the 5% that doesn't feel ashamed to love Goku , re-post this . Thank you , Goku . I am lifted up in your presence and am glad to share my energy for a Spirit Bomb . 
is off work . Now for lots of nothing . :)

\We are not a boy band . We are a MAN BAND ! \ " - < PROPMALE > White " 
I am floating ...... I am floating ...... 
So sad ... Please put this on your status if you know or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a stupid person right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity and sympathy does not help . Sometimes a 2x4 to the back of the head helps , but not a lot . But we can raise awareness ! 53% won't re-post this because they don't know how to copy/paste 
PLEASE post this as your status if you , or someone you know has been eaten by penguins . Penguins are nearly unstoppable , and when hungry , also breathe fire . 71% of people won't copy this into their status because they have already been eaten by penguins . Another 28% won't because they are hiding in their showers with fire extinguishers -- awaiting the coming Penguin-apocalypse . The remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post . 
Ready to get back into the grind today ... except I don't start until 4:45 . :/ 
$556 on 3 textbooks . :( #becominganhero 
First day of senior year = shittons of homework but great success 
would like to wish < PROPFIRST > Tillman good luck with his first day of college ! 
If you're angry at a loved one , hug that person . And mean it . You may not want to hug - which is all the more reason to do so . It's hard to stay angry when someone shows they love you , and that's precisely what happens when we hug each other . ~ Walter < PROPMALE > 
I'm drawing the line , I'm drawing the line , I'm drawing the line , I'm drawing the line and I have my pride .

Vacation week is over . :( Back to paradise today . 
We raise the vibratory level ... 
Got a haircut . I look less like a hobo now lol . 
\The demand for insulin for diabetics is very inelastic . \"" 
Despite the fact that I have less free time this semester than any other so far , I feel really happy with my classes and career path . I guess I'm just really happy with how life is going right now . :) 
In 3 hours I'll be on a 4-day weekend . Yesssssss

After this coming week , I'll have been back in school for a month . Only 8 more until graduation ! :) 
\My love life is like a Rush song - complicated and wanky . \"" 
That was a close call , but I made the right decision . I think . :/

\Look at that house 
will survive class tonight thanks to the awesome power of Mountain Dew . 
Were we ever warmer on that day ? A million < PROPMALE > away . It seemed from all of eternity ... 
It's hard to explain to someone who has no clue . It's a daily struggle being in pain or feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside . Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has an invisible illness ( PTSD , Anxiety , Bipolar , Cancer , Depression , Diabetes , LUPUS , Fibromyalgia , MS , ME , Arthritis , Cancer , Heart Disease , Epilepsy , Autism , COPD , M.D. etc . ) \Never judge what you don't understand . \ " I know my real friends will copy . ? ........... " 
New goal : My life used to be about me and I've realized I have lost touch with that . It's time I go back to doing more things for my own sake and more family stuff too . Oh , and finally learn to play guitar sometime within the next year . Preferrably a 7-string lol . 
is going down to UK today with my grandparents to visit < PROPFIRST > Tillman . Prepare yourself young grasshopper . 
Anyone interested in going to see Mastodon and The Dillinger Escape Plan in Indy on November 17th ? It's still tentative for now , but most likely I'm going . 
rises in the morning air , greeted by cinders of the dead . 
A deeper cut into the flesh of life\ 
A sharper kind of knife\ 
A deeper cut into the throat of grey\ 
Come take me far away , come take me far away\ 
Lead me astray 
* Insert status about how much we all hate Mondays here . * 
wants to grow up to be , be a debaser . 
RIP < PROPMALE > 
Maybe eventually I'll have a day that doesn't involve homework , work , applying for c o-o ps , and applying for graduation involved in it . All work and no play makes < PROPFIRST > a dull boy . ;) 
So Apple's stock is up today even after Jobs ' death .... ummm .... what ? \ 
That being said , it's certainly good for my group project . 
Only 4 more hours and then studying . Watch out , it's exciting stuff . 
\Government is the great fiction 
\Attempting to Go to Bed : Take 1\ " . Let's hope this works . " 
is now on fall break ! 
I like how even though I'm on fall break , I still spend most of my free time working on school-related stuff . Is it May yet ? 
So apparently < PROPFIRST > Secondi is my child . How did this happen ?! :O 
Arkham City = GotY . Calling it now . 
Sigh :/
