That hobbit you just called fat ? He's skipping 3nd breakfast . That dwarf woman you just called ugly ? She spends hours braiding her beard so you can differenciate her from a dwarf man . That Uruk-Hai you just killed ? He's been abused by Saruman . See that Gollum creature with gangly limbs & large eyes ? For 500 years the Ring poisoned his mind . That elf you just made fun of for crying ? She just lost her wizard friend to a Balrog . Repost this if you are against bullying in Middle-Earth . 
Back from my first class of A-Team . I have an awesome class and we're dancing to ' Rockin ' Around the Christmas Tree ' in September . Now I'm home , in a tank-top and shorts , and drinking ice cold water in a fancy wine/champagne glass . FTW !

If you're brave , make this your status 
You're not a hero , you're a liar\ 
You're not a savior , you're a vampire\ 
Sucking the life out of all the friends you've ever known\

Up on your soapbox , preaching down to the sinners\ 
A saint without a cause\
