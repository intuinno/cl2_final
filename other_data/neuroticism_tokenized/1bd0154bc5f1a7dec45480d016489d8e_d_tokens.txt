A very safe and happy fourth of July to all !! 
Happy Birthday , My Mom !! 
I love Saturdays with my husband !!! Getting off the computer so I can get back to enjoying it ! 
Had to vote for our mayor yesterday ... Didn't want it to be my fault if Super < PROPFEMALE > became mayor of Saratoga Springs ... 
Well my work here is done ... took a couple quizzes to relax and I'm off to bed . Did I pull the car into the garage ??? 
Everyone is having date night , but me . I'm having ME night . 
Husband did the laundry this weekend ... how cool is that ? 
Feels like the weekend ... but I have work tomorrow ... I better go to bed . 
Heading to the exercise room ... I can do this ! 
I'm so sore today ... workout is slower , but I'm still doing it ! 
This is one of the best years ever !! Loving husband , daughters doing so good making all of us proud . Happy grandbabies .... this is the life !!! 
Almost forgot ! I gotta exercise tonight . My date with the elliptical machine . 
LOTS and LOTS of new music ! < PROPFEMALE > and Kenzie picked some good songs . 
Loved seeing my Tukker & Maveryk ! 
What a very HAPPY Birthday I'm having !!! Thanks for all the birthday wishes !!! Putting carpet in the new bedroom in the basement today ... then more finish work . Painted until 1:00 am to make sure we were ready for the carpet installation today . 
Helping to assemble a closet organizer for < PROPFEMALE>'s room . It's almost done ... 
If you are a wife , that has a wonderful husband that works so hard and would give up anything just to give to you , then repost this ... ' cuz * I * have the most wonderful husband in the world !! ~ I love him very much ~ Ü 
If you believe your Daughters are amongst the greatest blessings on the face of this earth , copy and paste this as your status and give them a hug ! I ? MY DAUGHTERS ! 
I can tell you right where my focus has been ... the dessert table . Ughh !!! Tie me to the treadmill and just leave me there , till I can behave . Can you say \Heavy with Regret \"?!?" 
We're all starin ' at computers ... ah ... family time . ( we are in the same room , anyway ) 
A nice soak in a < PROPFEMALE > Milk Bath ... just what I needed to help wash the sick off . Hmmm . I'm thinking some Sleepy Time Tea with < PROPFEMALE > for my throat ... will someone make it for me ? 
I'm feeling MUCH better . Just in time for the weekend ! 
OK Not going to finish this today .... time to go HOME !!! 
Looking for some music for the ipod ... Tomorrow I start the \Couch to 5k\ " program . What we do for our sisters ... " 
I hit my target weight today !!! After 57 weeks ... 54 pounds gone !!! Food riddance !! 
The Couch to 5k Week 1 workout is kicking my butt ! I did manage to run all the running intervals but the last one . I'm thinking next week will be Week 1 again . 
under my desk , at work ... 
Friday ??? Where are you ??? 
A quiet Saturday Morning ... just the sound of the washing machine . 
If you can't be a good example ~ then you'll just have to be a horrible warning . 
I spent almost the entire weekend in the kitchen ... I made 4 different salsas . My favorite ? Mango Chipotle ! 
Sun Products is my favorite company ! They awarded < PROPFEMALE > a merit scholarship to use towards her education at SUU !!! If they had a jingle , I'd be singing it ! 
Thanks for the anniversary wishes ! 5 Fabulous Years ! 
It's ok not to have a status ... 
I think I've made peace with the past , but why do I want to just avoid it ???? 
Leap !!! ... and the net will appear . 
My back is achey and tired ... Maybe it's from all that hula-hoopin' ?? 
Hot bath ... as soon as I can get the three teenagers out of my tub . 
Hiiiiiiii-ho ! Hi- ho ! It's back to work for a half-day and then I get to visit with my parents ! 
Remember back when Facebook was teaching us about posting a status ? \I feel ... \ " and you got to choose ? I just realized they quit doing that . ... Or was that My Space and I just quit doing THAT ? " 
If they HAVE to grow up , I'm glad they all manage to do it with such beauty and class ! Makes my heart happy . I love my girls !! 
Today I begin three weeks with no sugar and no wheat . Wish me luck ! 
I'm surprised I actually still like my morning steel cut oats now that there is only fresh fruit to sweeten it . I love my oats ... but I wasn't looking forward to the prospect of bland oatmeal . Yay ! I can do this . 
Ahhh ! Weekend ! I am so glad you're here ! 
If it hurts when you do this ... Don't do it . 
Monday , here I come ! 
\ ... and guess who won the $3000 spa get away package ... Guess ! \ " . \ 
Yay ! Plans to see the < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tukker who is throwing a spectacular birthday event this evening . ALL the other princesses and princes will be there ! I can't wait to see them all decked out in their < PROPMALE > gear ! 
I really enjoyed watching the granddaughters tonight . They loved < PROPFEMALE > Amerah ! - but what's not to love ? She's very good with kids ! Happy Birthday Tukker ! 
Working hard to get < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > vacuumed and dusted away so Miss Kenzie has an enjoyable week at the house . 
Inception ... I want to see it but I wish it didn't take away from the time I have to get the housework done . When did I get to this place ? I used to look for any excuse not to do housework . 
Lots of construcrion out my way , but they are getting it done fast ! I'm excited ! 
I'm so ready for sleep ! 
Time goes by too fast ! Kiss your babies ! ( no matter how old they are ! ) 
< PROPFEMALE > , Kenzie and I are all getting haircuts . I love this back to school prep , especially when I get to participate . 
Reese's Pieces ... mmmm . :) 
I don't think there's ANY retail therapy that's going to make it all better . Guess I'll just have to focus on how proud I am that she's going to college , and less on how that means I won't see her everyday . 
I don't think you could have packed any more stress into one day . ( I waited until now to say it . I didn't want to issue a challenge to the universe or anything ... ) 
thinks we should all take the afternoon off from our work and enjoy the day . Can we have it declared a mandatory holiday ? ... before I get back to the plant ? ... please ? someone ? 
Your purpose is what you say it is . Follow your bliss .

< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST>' Casino Birthday party was awesome ! I loved seeing everyone dressed up and having a good time . Thanks to everyone who came and for making it so fun ! 
I'm hoping it's all over in the morning . I mean , yes , I want to wake up , but when I do I don't want to feel like someone is wringing my insides out . 
My sister < PROPFIRST > said she got a < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > video ... since I'm a < PROPMALE > copycat when it comes to trying something that my sisters try ... I had to get one . $10 and all you need is hand weights for her power circuit training video . HIGHLY RECOMMEND . It was HARD but I can't wait to do it again !

Easing into Monday ... I like it . 
Good thing I don't have cable at home ... haven't done anything else all night . 
I loved your beautiful face with your great big eyes and how contagious your smile was . I loved that you were always happy to see me and recognized me even after many years ... You were so little when we saw each other all the time ... Rest in peace , little girl . Love and light to your family . 
Love your Mom . Make her proud . Take her advice about taking good care of yourself . Hug her as often as you can . Help her clean something . Give her a kiss . Be grateful you've got someone on your side ... Thank her . \

I would like two more weekend days , please . 
Weigh-in today puts me exactly where I was a week ago . Just think what could have been if I'd thrown some exercise in there ! 
A nap ... That's what I need . 
In bed before 11 on the most scary night of the year ... well on the night before the most scary night of the year . :) 
I was going to set the clocks back this morning , but am remembering now that we fall back in November . 
Weighing in after my Lindor's Chocolate Halloween , and it did go up a little , but not enough for the wii to ask the reason for my weight gain . WooHoo ! 
Achy and my throat is starting to really hurt . I need chicken noodle soup for supper . 
Opened all the windows in the house this afternoon , to let the house air out . Don't want the \sick\ " getting stuck in here ! "

Two more business trips this month . I'm ready to stay home for awhile ! 
Husband pointed out that my word of the year tradition does not make for a good goal ... specific measurable , blah , blah , blah ... lol . It's more of a theme than a goal ... but shall consider getting goals defined to support my word of the year . Next years word has come early !! I'm so excited !

it . \ 
There's a price to pay if you want to make things better , a price to\

< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > said used car prices are at a record high , and if you can get 0 percent interest and an aggresively priced new vehicle , then it may actually be better to buy new .
