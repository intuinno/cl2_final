Anyone want to go see Green Hornet with me and my love tonight ? 
I dont know what is up with this north san < PROPFIRST > water . So I added a few buckets of water to my turtle tank , and the next day ALL of my fish are gone and my turtles are sitting on the bottom of the tank all full and bloaty looking . Hundreds and hundreds of fish , gone overnight . Jeez . That water was a pricey mistake . 
Today is < PROPMALE>'s Birthday and he is spending it doing jury duty . Poor husband . 
Awesome day .. ready to crash and burn 
Ever get the feeling that you are missing something but can figure out what it is ? 
So my crush tells me that she had a dream about telling someone she thought was my husband an important message to give me , and then in her dream realized it wasn't him she told the message to . Is it weird to be frustrated that I never got to know what the message was that her subconscious wanted to tell me ? 
Depressing day 
I am an awesome wife . Cant wait to give him his Valentines present 
I am < PROPFEMALE > freakin excited ! I put my deposit down to reserve my baby toyger ! :) He is just a little embryo right now . 
Sometimes I really really wish there was a dislike button on this site . 
The fancy beer that I got for < PROPMALE>'s Valentines day present came today . Funny that , I thought they were the big bottles but they are just average beer bottle size . Guess I should have paid more attention to the unit conversion . I hope it is as awesome as I have heard . 
What does a girl wear to a bachelor party when she isn't the planned entertainment ? How about a fedora , zoot suit , and sparkly purple cock ? No but really ! WTF does a girl wear ? 
Wide awake and my mind is reeling . Perhaps I shouldn't have done those redbull shots . 
Fucking awesome day . :D 
Stir crazy . I need to blow off some steam . 
Anyone want to go see Red Riding Hood with me ? It comes out tomorrow . 
My car ate my wedding band . Fuuuuuuuuuck . 
dammmn 8.9 earthquake in Japan . Today really was a shitty day . 
I can't wait until the weather is awesome enough for the driveins again . 
Lazy today 
I just learned how to brand a person with dry ice . Too bad J and I have that pesky rule of inflicting no permanent marks . Anyone want to let me practice on them ? 
My email was hacked . So if any of you got an email by me that says I am emotional over some link , do yourself a favor and don't click on it . I repeat , I have not sent out any emails about my emotional welfare and it is likely a hacker virus . Sorry for any inconveniences . 
Drive ins are postponed due to rain ! Now I'm going to 4th Street Bowling alley this Tuesday evening if anyone wants to join . Hoping to get a group together . They have bowling and pool tables too . I suck at both . Who wants to come and beat me ? 
Who is going bowling/playing pool tonight ? 
Thanks for the night of drunken frolicking and fun ladies ! Oh btw to the person who left bite marks on me , I know who you are and I will get you back .

Very sad . The company made my turtle's basking tank wrong . I tried to correct it and got yelled at by the owner . She spoke to me like a parent reprimanding a naughty child . I have to try and dispute the charge . What drama . 
The crappy day left me in a funk . At least it is after midnight and a different day now . 
Anyone know of fun things to do on a sunday night/ Monday afternoon in North Lake Tahoe ? Besides hitting the slopes . 
Met my < PROPFEMALE > and his breeder and I couldn't be happier ! I'm in love . I think he likes me too .
