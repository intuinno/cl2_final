The one day we had sun , I enjoyed it so much that I made history . It is the second time in the history of < PROPFIRST > Doane where I've actually burned . Although less then 24 hours and it is almost gone . :P 

Back in Plymouth in new apartment . It's going to be boring as hell as long as I'm here by myself and no one is back yet . 
Training is boring . t.t 
is enjoying the calm before the storm on Sunday .

PhysX , as awesome as it is , I wish it did my Physics homework for me . D: 
Today is Friday . :D

Weew ! 
I think it is safe to say that this semester is driving me INSANE . Brought to you by University Physics I . 
Shall I bake you some web cookies ? :-O 
I'm hating physics right now . I really don't care much for angular momentum and torque . : < 
Yesterday I exercised my right at a citizen 21 years of age and casually walked into Hannford's and purcased a 12-pack of < PROPFIRST > Adams Winter Lager . A strange experience , but a good one . :D 
I would like it if Blizzard made sure that their services worked before implementing < PROPMALE > changes to their games . -Cough- 3.3.0 -Cough- Disconnected from server at login . : < 
They had to cancel all classes * after * my first . : < 
do < PROPFIRST > do . 
Where did all my friends go that I used to see all the time ? I feel like people have disappeared from the face of the earth without a trace . I'm rather bored , no one ( according to AIM ) is around ( Exeter ) . 
is really bored . : < 
Blarg . 
< PROPFIRST > Adams < PROPMALE > Pils is pretty good . 
Not quite sure what to think of the iPad . 
A WINTER STORM WARNING FOR HEAVY SNOW MEANS SEVERE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED OR OCCURRING . SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF SNOW ARE FORECAST THAT WILL MAKE TRAVEL DANGEROUS . ONLY TRAVEL IN AN EMERGENCY . IF YOU MUST TRAVEL ... KEEP AN EXTRA FLASHLIGHT ... FOOD ... AND WATER IN YOUR VEHICLE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY . 
Does nobody have anything better to do then give me invites to a game on Facebook ? 
Over 5 years ago , I started playing WoW when classic came out . It was fun , had no problem with it . I even put up with leveling on a PVP server . What happened ? Every time I run an instance I'm surrounded by idiots , and when I'm not , WoW disconnects or crashes . Blizzard , what the hell have you become , that is almost as bad a Cryptic . : < 
All I see is FarmVille this and FarmVille that . Doesn't anyone have anything better to do ? 
Eh ? 
Eh . 
Last straw . It's time for my tower to become immune to the majority of malicious software . Time to do a backup for ~ 800-900GB and install * nix . Windows no more . D: 
Not looking forward to Physics test in 45 minutes . 
GAH ! WTF Snow ?! 
Happy 420 all . 
Someone fucking broke into my car ! If I find out who did it , I'm going to go ape shit . 
I haven't had a cigarette in 48 hours . 
The new Steam is pretty cool and Digsby just previewed an email for me , that said something about a Phenom X6 . I wanna check that out . : > 
No cigarette in 1 week . 
I find it amusing how Captain Janeway loves to piss off the Borg . 
has learned that the electric field generated by an AC current running through a wire can cause distortion through an optical SPDIF cable . 
I think I can learn to love having a pint while I wait for a sandwich . 
Going to bed . I will be practicing Physics while I sleep . 
I was on my alt and we got < PROPFEMALE > to 19% HP . 10/12 . W00t ! 
I'm not sure which case I want to replace my\ 
old one . I'm considering :\

I passed University Physics II with a grade better than a D ! :D 
Blah . 
BP is so screwed . 
New Case = AWESOME ! My idle and load temps dropped by 10 degrees celsius , thats more OC headroom ! 
saml saml saml saml saml ... 
Got LK down to 26% . >_> 
Woo ! Up north ! 
Last night I witnessed a well constructed plan carried out to steal a 30-pack of < PROPMALE > from Mobile in Hampton . It was done flawlessly , except that there are cameras all around the Mobile and I'm sure his face is on at least one of the cameras . :P 
So a week goes by and apparently my druid is now guildless . 
I just got a SC2 Beta key from Blizz . Fuck yeah ! 
You know , Blizzard's extending the maintainance by 4 hours thing is starting to annoy me again . 
Fucking Blizzard . My account was hacked ! I know that my tower is secure , shows much much effort Blizzard has put into security . 
Got all my gear and stuff back . I had something like 706 runecloth , so I let my mage tailor it all into enchanting mats . I missed being able to play my mage . 
So last night when I was coming back home my brake peddle sunk to the floor while I was driving . Wasn't too happy about that . 
The StarCraft Single Player Campaign had a good story but it was * way * too short . it was like . 15-20 hours of single player on normal difficulty . After waiting this many years I was expecting more . 
I've been with VLACS for 2 years now . :) 
Wandering aimlessly down the road which is my mind . 
People should RealID friend me : jrdoane@gmail.com 
My monitor was acting weird , making a quick buzzing noise then screen goes away . Had to power-cycle the monitor to get it to work . If I need to move on to RMA #5 with Hann(Spree/sG ) I'm demanding a refund . Note to all , never get a HannSpree or HannsG monitor . Every one I've gotten has been a lemon ( all 4 of them so far , I'm on replacement #4 and this will make 5 lemons if it completely stops working . ) 
Feeling sick ... 
Feeling better . Nothing like a Billingsgate sandwich to resolve the issue of my sickly and empty stomach . 
Now I'm * very * full . 
Went and saw the doctor today . He thinks I'm either finishing off a virus or a minor case of salmonella poisoning . Either way I should be fine . 
Fucking Pontiac . The OTHER rear brake line died now . I swear , every passing month I hate this car more and more . 
\Beep . Boop . I'm a computer . \"" 
I got wireless working on my other tower . :D 
gah , didn't sleep well last night . only got 6 hours of sleep . t.t 
so tired . only ~ 5 1/2 hours of sleep . I wanted 8 . : < 
\Shoes are a gateway drug . \ " \ 
My god , what has Blizzard done to talents in the PTR ?! I will be damned if I get a simplified talent tree because some 11 year old who shouldn't be playing WoW can't understand how to build a talent tree . D:< 
Holy crap . For once my personal email's inbox is EMPTY ! :D 
Gahhh . I was walking to class , and half way there , out of no where , it started down-pouring . By the time I got back to my apartment I was drenched . D: 
A useless Facebook status update . 
Oh god . Patch 4.0.0 . Talents will never be the same . t.t 
Typical Blizzard . Never finished < PROPMALE > upgrades on time . They should improve their estimates because obviously they're underestimating every time . 
WoW has been ruined . t.t 
General Chemistry I was cancelled today . :3 \ 
Honestly I really don't like this class , but a legit science with lab is required and I don't want to leave it for my last semester . >:| 
I'm awake before sunrise . t.t 
Infuriated at the result of my last Computer Architecture test grade . >:-| 
Mmmm . Udon and vegetable stir fry . nom nom nom .

Today is the tomorrow that we worried about yesterday . 
Overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have to get done . 
So I got the video card and now all I see if blue screens . This isn't the way to start a relationship Barts . D: 
So a new power supply fix that issue . So a couple things about the 6870 ... \ 
A : It eats power , make sure you provide it with enough . \ 
B : When the fan is at 100% it sounds like a jet taking off . 
Up at 6:10 am . ewww .... tired ... the run isn't even up , again ?! 
Eating PHP ... Mmmmmmm , script . 
I started my day at 8:00 am with a Gen Chem I lab , I continued lab then worked until 4:00 , where I took a 1 hour break , then worked on my software engineering project until 11:00 pm . I want my weekend NAO ! D:<

Happy December 1st . 
It's snowing . 
Apparently hald doesn't work unless you start it . /derp 
I just opened an old keyboard , cut the USB cord , and soldered a new one on and now it works again . :3 
I feel like a one man army taking on the endless waves of stupidity , ignorance , and insanity of people in the world . 
Done with both semester long projects , presented and all . I survived . 
I don't understand why someone would want a multi-thousand dollar watch ... It works like the ones that are only 50 !!

I assume it means I have good hearing when I can hear the differences between 44.8 Khz @16 -bit playback upsampled to 192Khz @24 -bit . Native sampling has less precise sounds as well as some slight distortion . Audio is \smoother . \""

Hannaford's has this sparkling blood orange juice and I would almost go as far to say it is better then Orangina .
