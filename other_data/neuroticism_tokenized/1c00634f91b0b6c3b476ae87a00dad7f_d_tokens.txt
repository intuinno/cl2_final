For some reason , when ever I try to play Empire at war online , the screen freezes . 

Assassin's creed has a legit multiplayer . It's very intense . 
To whom it concerns ... I just played an hour and a half long game of empire at war . I destroyed home one , Admiral Ackbar's capital ship , six times . That is all . 
Ha ! take that you damn fly ! 
Meh . This site isn't for me . :/ last post for a while . I'll probably get bored some time during summer and come back for a day or two . Don't expect to hear from me . 
Why do people type out the words to a song ? If you want to say you like a song then say it ! 
aaaaaaaaaaaand ...... g'night 
Missing the starcraft 2 beta T_T without it I have too much time to do other useless things ... like check my facebook ... 
i want to say something meaningful but I can't think of anything ... 
starcraft 2 > win . Despite the two dimensional characters , I found the story mode to be both enjoyable and challenging . The multiplayer , as expected blew away all expectations . 
just got back from tennis camp . My team won the pointless competition ! Go Peurto Rican Pumas ! 
8:49 P . M ... A time that will go down in history . none of my friends are on , certainly a first for me . 
Ad Hominem :\ 
This is the best logical fallacy , and if you disagree with me , well , you suck . 
Revenge goes by many names , the most common being Justice . 
< PROPFEMALE > wars marathon on spike ^^ 
< PROPMALE > Tarantino , you basterd . I was with you on the whole killing hitler thing up until the point where EVERYONE DIES . spoiler alert btw ... Movies where all but 2 or 3 of the main characters die just piss me off . I donno why ... they just do .

So , waiting for Company of Heroes online to patch ... for 6 hours ... fml . \ 
This had better be worth it < PROPMALE > ... 
So ... Company of Heroes ... It's too slow for me to really get into it . \ 
I'll give it another try but ... I donno . 
I have decided\ 
Starcraft is much better than CoH ... Don't think it's even worth me learning to play . 
Oh btw , I got my license this weekend . 
So , when I was helping out my little brother with math , I kind of got carried away and started to teach him how to multiply/divide fractions . He just wanted to learn how to divide ... 
Please repost if you know or are related to someonekilled on the second Death < PROPFEMALE > . People need to see that the rebels area band of terrorist scum . The Empire only wanted an active military defense for our great galaxy , but the Rebels blew it up and killed our Imperial troops and civilian ... contractors . The Rebels c ... ontinue to use violence in support of a supposed peaceful ideology . 93% won't repost this .

Went to hit shift-w but ended up hitting ctrl-w , exiting out of all my tabs ... \

Just got finished playing Nazi zombies for ONE AND A HALF HOURS . 
So , I got Assassin's Creed : Brotherhood and < PROPFEMALE > Wars : Empire at War today . \ 
Success has been achieved . 
What's happenin ' , hot stuff ? 
I like your narrative structure , but it's also confusing in places . You need to provide a few more hints of time and place if you are going to use so many shifts . Dialogue and interior thoughts are strengths . Details are fair , but could be better . \ 
I like the creative risks you take -- they just need to be honed a little more . \ 
96/100\ 
My short story has received Porrit's stamp of approval . My life is complete . 
Steps to success : \ 
1 . Get sick\ 
2 . Suffer unbearably \

4 . Stay home from school\ 
5 . Profit 
Watching shutter island . About an hour in . \

Sore from sleeping so much today . Getting sick is tough ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Nguyen , why are you such a crazy asian ? I liked all of your recent posts , the ones in all caps , because they reminded me that you are an insane asian . But that made me wonder : why are you so crazy ? Please tell me , is it BECAUSE you are asian ? I want to know . 
I bit off more than I could chew ... then chewed it anyway ... 
Watching professionals play starcraft . This is , in fact , how I want to spend my weekend ... 
So how did I spend my day ? Well , I turned myself into a decent sniper in call of duty and .... nope , that's about it .
