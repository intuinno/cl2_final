Happy Independence Day to all you proud Americans ! And to those who hate this free country that you live in , remember that you have the freedom to leave . Love you all !

So I went Latin Dancing last night and it was AMAZING ! In fact , amazing is an understatement . I loved every second . Though I now have the < PROPFEMALE > splints that come with dancing in heels all night long . Gha , I can't wait to go again ! 
I want to go dance ( what else is new ) . Just watched a movie with Mr. < PROPMALE > and my parents ... That was interesting .. haha . Now time to watch Twilight for tomorrow . 
is in quite the irritable mood . And I really don't know why ... This sucks ! 
is more than a little pissy . 
is feeling a little happier . I am going dancing tonight :) I can't wait . 
didn't get to go dancing :( oh well . At least I got to go to the shop ... 
feels like absolute crap . 
is just getting ready to leave to go backpacking ( then girls camp ) tomorrow morning . If you guys want to send me a letter just text and ask for the address . Love ya guys ! 
just got back from girls camp . I am coming back from CA tomorrow then I leave for Ballroom Camp on Monday . 
is totally ready to go dance her heart out for a few days !!! 
can't describe how strongly she loves to do Ballroom . It's so wonderful , in every sense of the word . 
wishes she was still dancing ... 
wants nothing more than to dance all day long . 
' s body simply aches all over .. This totally sucks ... I wanna dance but I feel like absolute crap . 
\I know asking high school seniors to be abstinent is like asking a porcupine to poop goat cheese . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > Time = Cold bottle of Pellegrino , Big comfy sweater , scented candles , chill music ( < PROPFEMALE > Jones , Mazzy < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Krall ) , reading & writing poetry ... Ahh . THIS is the life . PS I don't want to grow up . I just want to stay right here in this moment . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s Plan for today : Grab a couple bottles of Pellegrino . Go kill the giant spider outside of window . Open that window up . Lock bedroom door . Crank up the chill music ( < PROPFEMALE > Jones , Mazzy < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Krall ) , and let the artistic mood flow ... Hopefully I shall accomplish finishing a couple paintings and get a couple more started . Also I want to finish a few poems and start on three more . 
is thinking again . 
can't seem to fall asleep !!! 
... You all just wait and see . I will become what I want to be . I can do anything , no matter what you say or think . 
just found a random grocery bag in the fridge that contain a package of bacon and a jar of miracle whip ... can you say amazing !? Mmm . 
went on a midnight walk with < PROPMALE > , then went on one of our famous midnight Walmart runs and got some sushi ! 
is feelin ' rather down and now has to get up really early for work so she is gonna try to sleep . Night . 
is sooo stoked to go hike Mt . Timpanogos on Saturday with < PROPFIRST > !!! Its gonna be a blast :D We are going all the way to the top ! Whoop ! Go us ! 
better go to bed . Gonna go hike Mt . Timpanogos tomorrow ! Wish me luck ! 
just hiked to the VERY TOP of Mt . Timpanogos ! It was amazing and I am feeling pretty good besides the killer sunburn on my legs . 
is feelin ' pretty recovered from hiking Timp yesterday . I spent the day with < PROPMALE > W . and < PROPFIRST > at his Mom's house and now I am getting ready to go on a walk with < PROPMALE > R . It's been quite the nice day . 
is just chillin ' . I can't wait for the new adventures that lay ahead of me in life :) 
is incredibly stressed . Life is just crashing down at the wrong time . Ugh . 
I know that this is the right thing for everyone . And doing the right thing makes me happy . Lets just hope she goes for the well thought out argument I have presented . This really is the best way .. I know it is . 
... urg . 
Hey everyone ! If you happen to know of a decent dance ( ballroom ) studio , within a reasonable distance , please let me know . 
So yeah , I really want to go Salsa dancing tonight and/or Saturday . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s Retard Moment of the Day : So one of my favorite songs comes on ( The Horror of Our Love - Ludo ) & so I decide to do a crazy interpretive to it ( how could I NOT dance to that song ) . So dancing my heart out ( as much as I can in a car ) with the window rolled down , the song comes to an intense part & as I throw my arms out the window my hat goes flying into the road & I had to go fetch it . Thank you for reading :D

I find it amusing how half of your life plans can be changed after one simple conversation . But it's for the better and I like this plan even more . Anyways , it sounds like < PROPMALE > is a total no-go but Africa here I come !!! 
Freaking pissed . I wish he would just go away , there is no point for him to try and connect with me anymore . 
Gonna play my guitar and then hit the sack .

I feel weary and anxious . Life is just tiring and stressful and I don't even know what to think . I can't wait to leave for California .. I need to get away from everyone and everything for a little bit . 
Good Job to everyone in the play tonight ! Thank you to everyone who came :} It means a lot to me and I hope you enjoyed it ... Humm I think I am allergic to stage make up ! I have sores on my eyelids and a couple on my face :( It hurts . lol Oh well .. All in the name of theatre !!!!

Welp ! Carlin did a great job tonight :) I am gonna get off of the ' puter . Text me !!! 
OKay , first off , Slimfast doesn't stop hunger for four freaking hours like it says it does . And second , I really HATE nightmares . I had an awful one last night and I woke up with all my muscles tense up and I could hardly move . Eep . 
So , I love < PROPFEMALE > . Guys frustrate me . I am an idiot , as proven many times before . And there are not enough hours in the day . 
Welp I leave for California tomorrow morning . I can't wait to get away . Bye everyone ! 
Chillin ' in the airport ready to get out of here and go to California !

THIS is my time of year . I have tinsel and lights and strands of beads and a mini christmas tree in my room :) It's so nice . I am drinking apple cider , listening to Bing Crosby singing White Christmas , and decorating my tree . Ahh .. I need to go for a drive this week and check out all the Christmas lights now ! 
\The rebel inside . A mind of my own . I haven't felt right . Since the moment that I gave up . I challenge my limits . I'm feeling I'm becoming meaningless . I take it all in . And inhale . I'm wide awake . Open my eyes . And the sky's so blue . All of the sudden . I know that I treasure my life . I find myself . Wide awake . Like you ... \ " ~ Lacuna Coil " 
Honestly ? I am so sick of that lame excuse .... Grrr . Anyways , can't sleep . I think I will paint . 
I'm wide awake-Open my eyes-And the sky's so blue-All of the sudden-I know that I treasure my life-I find myself-Wide awake-Like you ... ~ Lacuna Coil 
Here's an idea , why don't you grow up and stop acting like a butt hurt < PROPFEMALE > ?! Grr . Anyways , I think it's time for my therapy session with Dr. Paintbrush . And perhaps some chips and dip to assist in that session . 
Oh the joys of finishing a piece of artwork :)

I can't handle any more of this dreary weather !!!!! YOU HEAR ME ?! I CAN'T!!!!!!! I want to actually see hte sun rise when I have to be up early in the morning . I need some sunlight and some rain ( NOT snow ) . I need the happy weather where you can go out in a tee shirt , shorts , and no shoes !!! >:| 
I think I am gonna throw on my favorite jeans , flannel shirt , and my 49ers cap today and just be chill ... YUP sounds like a plan to me :D 
Kinda bummed I'm not doing anything exciting for Superbowl Sunday ... 
Can't wait to get the heck out out of here for < PROPFIRST>'s day . St. < PROPFIRST > here I come ! 
\How many times have I done this to myself ? How long will it take before I see ? When will this hole in my heart be mended ? Who now is left alone but me ? \ " Good song . " 
My < PROPFIRST>'s Day consists of long boarding , safari adventures , climbing trees , getting suck in those trees hanging mby my pants , then listening to sappy love songs , and eating jello with marshmallows ... sounds like a good day to me ! 
Totally loving < PROPMALE > for bringing me Twix , Snickers , and Dr. Pepper :P 
Had yet another great day :) Went out with Storm & got some new strings for my beloved guitar as well as some new canvases ! I then went and got 5 Guys with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . Afterwards , < PROPFIRST > and I went on a secret mission and back to my house for some serious talks and artistic vibe sharing lol Hmm . 
Fingers crossed for another good day . 
Blah . School kinda ruins everything , including a streak of good days . I wanna cuddle up & go to sleep . Hmm ... I have way to many people to keep up with lately . It's sad when friendship becomes stressful ( I still love you all ! ) . At least I have been able to paint , play the guitar , and get some poetry written .. 
I am really getting sick of these dreams/nightmares ... 
I love theatre ... just in case you all didn't know this fact ... Oh and I love my guitar ... he's my best friend for sure ;P Humm .... 
So I must say , that I really like to babysit my siblings in the morning . I made an awesome breakfast that they got to help with , and now they are playing a jolly game in their rooms with very happy tummies ! :D WHOOP go me ! lol

I CANNOT wait for Spring break . I need to turn my phone off and go to California .... 22 more days and I'm outta here .. 
Best Sunday I have had in a long time :)

Well today ... Uh ... Er ... Um ... Has been a day ?... At least theatre people at RHS are the bomb . It brightened my day that much more to spend a couple hours in the mass chaos that comes with a group of thespians . 
Super sleepy , don't feel good , and missing people :( 
The past week has been the hardest I have had in a very long time , but things turned around this evening for my birthday . It was wonderful to share some smiles and silly dancing ( to the Newsies soundtrack of course ! ) with my family :) 
Welp , time to go wave the freak flag . I am going to school all decked out in 80's gear today ! I wonder how socially unaccepted I'm going to be after this ... 
Just doing homework , watching Dancing With the Stars , and eating a freeze dried ice cream bar . Gotta hurry and finish up so I can go see a movie with my mom . 
will be attending the Park City Music Film Festival on Friday :) <3 
Ugh ... I hate feeling like crap ... someone please shoot me . 
This evening was indescribable . I have missed everyone so much that it just kills me inside . I loved chillin ' with the girls again and can't wait for tomorrow ;P 
This week is gonna be a good one :) 
Constantly inquire towards the future , live in the moment , never look back but always remember . 
AHSJ dance students did a spectacular job tonight ! I love and miss you all <3 Wish I could've been up there with you guys . 
Hmm , today was a good day . Went to the Madrigals performance and they were amazing ! What did you all do today ? 
I am officially on Silver Scribe for next school year ! <3 This week just keeps getting better and better ! 
El3 haha 
Nothing like a wonderful day finished with a good convo , so you think you can dance , and raspberry bars <3 
First batch of Raspberry bars should be done at 1 ... then I have to put the second tray in ... And THIS my dear friends is why I don't make these stupid things all that often . Time to start cutting in more butter ... at least I'm getting a work out of sorts ! 
Well today was a pretty good day , except I think that I am losing my voice :( oh and I found a freaking GREY HAIR ! I'm 17 ! This isn't supposed to happen ! What the heck ?! 
Goin ' dancin ' tonight . Whoop 
Had a girls night and went dancing with < PROPFEMALE > last night , it was a ton of fun ! Time for another great day ! 
Had a wonderful time chillin ' yesterday El3 \ 
\ 
I feel mildly ridiculous , I fell asleep around 5:30 pm and here I am ... wide awake ... and it's 5:30 am ... haha Yeah ... I'm cool . \ 
I hope everyone has a fantastic Sunday ! 
So I had the brilliant idea to go outside and watch the sunrise this morning and I don't think I have ever seen such a beautiful sight . Perhaps it was the purple glow of the mountains in the west and the yellow light peeking over those in the east , or the pondering that took place , but all in all it was utterly splendid . I need to do this more often . Today will be an incredible day ! 
Letters to < PROPFEMALE > was simply adorable ! I loved it . Hmm so my mom said I reminded her of Jabba the hut ... Should I be offended ? 
I'm gonna go up and make me some waffles !!!! <3 
WARNING : < PROPFEMALE > is officially boycotting make-up ! The stupid stuff is too much of a pain in my butt to constantly be applying , touching up , and removing .. over and over and over again ! 
Had a meeting this morning and it went great , then breakfast with mom , and a wonderful summer afternoon nap . Now it's time to blast some 80's music to wake me up so that I can shower , do the dishes , and get to < PROPFIRST>'s for BOMC :P Whoop ! YAY for great days ! 
Different aspects of life are all shooting in opposite directions . Some with set paths others traveling arbitrary courses . It's like a twisted mix of comedy and tragedy . \ 
Anyways , BOMC was a blast . I can't wait for tomorrow . Oh and Senior Sunrise at 5 am tomorrow ... nothin ' like a bunch of sleepy , grumpy teenagers all gathering together in the wee hours of the morning ... 
Got the senior part .... now where's the sunrise ?! :P 
If you are open minded and optimistic , then you can start at the top , redefine the standards of the highest , and continue forward beyond your wildest of dreams . 
Senior sunrise , nap , chill with < PROPFIRST > :) , BOMC , then ice cream run and walk with < PROPMALE > ... Excellent day ? I vote yes :P 
To me , summer = ice cream for breakfast ! What does summer = to you ? 
Hmm so I just discovered that if you eat < PROPFEMALE>'s chili , then drink lemon lime Powerade , it tastes like the smell of Lysol ... 
They say life is beyond you're control . How you react to life , is completely your choice only . 
Just broke a string on my guitar and I don't have a backup ... I think I just might cry :( 
Oh , my friend , it's not what they take away from you that counts . It's what you do with what you have left . ~ Hubert Humphrey 
Cuddled up with my 5 y/o brother and 8 y/o sister eating gold fish . I love them so much . I wish we were this civil all the time lol My siblings really know how to make my day better :) 
Just failed miserably at fishing with < PROPFIRST > Bowers ! It's all his fault though ! He pissed off the universe by not watching Toy Story 1 ! Awesome adventure ending with milkshakes as an award for our epic failure !!! Pictures are coming soon :P 
Ahh . Back from a much needed night of latin dancing . I swear that is the one thing that will always cheer me up without fail . 
Rain , rain , come and stay . Please don't ever go away ... I love summer storms . They are by far my favorite . 
This week's plans : BOMC , more fishing , cleaning my awful room , Scottish Festival ( gotta find my t-shirt and show some Clan Crawford pride haha ) , and demolition derby ! Wonderful week ahead of me ? I think yes ! 
The Doctor and Ben&Jerry are the only men I need in my life ! :P <3 HAHA 
Oh my good gosh .. I am craving chow mein like none other ! * hollers * \Ohhh Mooother !!!! \"" 
Awesome day of attempting to get some stuff accomplished . My bathroom is being soaked in cleansing chemicals hahaha . Gha I can't wait for Glee !!! 
I think I am in the mood to watch some lovey dovey chick flicks . But there are so many ! Which ones do you all think I should watch ? 
* sings * Good Morning Baltimore !... er ... umm ... I mean Bluffdale .. \ 
Today is going to be a splendid and productive day ! 
So I am cleaning out my room and I finally found all my missing knee socks ( now that I don't even need them anymore since I don't go to AHSJ) ! lol 
wishes everyone in AHSJ's Musical Theatre performance luck ! Break a leg guys I love you all ! 
Avatar is the best movie ever ! 
Gotta make sure that my room is spick ' n span so I can go to the Scottish Festival today ! 
Don't you just love when you do something incredibly embarrassing ( ie trip over 3 things in a row ) in your room when you are alone and you still blush and look around to be sure that no one saw you ? 
Had an awesome afternoon/evening with < PROPFEMALE > Garner , < PROPMALE > Zaragoza , and < PROPFIRST > Halafuka ! You guys rock ! PS Congrats on getting the job < PROPMALE > ! 
Hmm ... I just found a thing of Power Bait in my bed ... I'm not sure how I feel about this .... lol 
Man . < PROPFEMALE > , New York , Disneyland/California , Hawaii , Italy , Spain . Why is everyone going on these amazing vacations and not taking me ? :( 
I need nothing more than to get out of UT ... grr and I can feel my optimism running low .. frustrating . PS I had an awesome evening last night though :) even if I was scared half to death . 
Gha ... Ballroom Camp looks like it will be amazing this year ... Foxtrot and Mambo ! :/ 
My lips hurt ! I think they are sunburned ! : * 
\I look like a Moose ... \ " \ " Yes ! But a very cute Moose ! Make all the boy Moose go Wgahhhh ... \ " BWAHAHA I love this movie ... " 
< PROPFEMALE > Diaries 2 , < PROPFIRST > Powers ( Gold Member ) , and now onto Pirates of the Caribbean ( At Worlds End ) ... I am greatly enjoying this random movie night :P 
Gha . I hate how my optimism comes and goes . I feel stuck yet again :/ C'mon life , give me some happy . I need some good uplifting motivation because mine seems to be slipping away >:| Happy thoughts , HAPPY FREAKING THOUGHTS !!!!!! 
A-Team was phenomenal !!! I think I am addicted ! I can't remember the last time I was so giddy after a movie !... 
Happy Father's Day to all you wonderful dads out there that truly deserve it . Keep up the great fathering . 
Not a bad day at all ! Went to the doc and to a couple stores w/ my momma , but I'm glad to be home , I've been driving in construction all freaking day long , GRR ! 
Gha , I just love feeling all happy and in a great mood <3 I think it's the weather and the fact that I got out of the house for most of the day :) 
School news paper is going to be freaking amazing this year !!! I'm so excited :} 
Today was a pretty decent day . Silver scribe meeting , nap , and chilled with some amazing friends <3 Don't know why I am in such a weird mood right now though .. I think I am going to turn on loud music and light some incense ... ahhh nice and relaxing . 
Hmm yet another pretty good day ... I had another silver scribe meeting and got a couple books on journalism and graphic design that I have to read , that should be fun . Gha I still need get the summer reading for AP English next year ... it's something like ' How to Read literature Like a Professor ' or something like that which sounds utterly boring . Guess I won't be finishing < PROPFEMALE > Eyre :( Oh well ! 
I just lost the game ............. 
Awesome afternoon/night in SLC ! I had a blast watching all the short films . Can't wait for more tomorrow ! 
I had a wonderful time in SLC with < PROPMALE > Rice today . The films weren't as good as yesterday in my opinion , but there were a couple pretty amazing ones that were very worth seeing . Awesome day for sure , now I am just incredibly exhausted . Time for food and sleep ! 
Do you every have those moments where it feels like time is standing still as you sit there in the sun and listen to the leaves blowing in the wind ? It's like nothing could be more perfect . Anyways , I think I am going to get the kids in their swim suits and have a little luau in the backyard with them <3 Time to make up some quick little ' invitations ' to the party :P 
Had a freaking blast with the kids <3 Gotta love summertime . Text me people ! 
Nice start to the day = Swedish Meatballs from IKEA ! lol 
Just chillin ' and enjoying life for what it is :) 
Fingers crossed for a summer storm <3 
Oh life , how I love thee so . But why must you be such a pain in my butt ?! Grr I wanna go to Ballroom Camp . PS The sun needs to take a break and give the clouds a < PROPMALE > to ' shine ' . 
( I saw Eclipse yesterday and I find it amusing that < PROPMALE > , all of a sudden , has a southern accent .... ) Anyways , I'm in heaven . I've got : So You Think You Can Dance + Painting + Incense + Cookie Dough ! 
Mmm . Taco < PROPFEMALE > makes my tummy very happy . I love summer <3 I suppose it's time to work on that letter about my Trax incident and then finish the dishes . 
Well I had a blast with < PROPFEMALE > and her family ... My day has kind of gone to crap now though , so at least I had a fun night . Bleh . I hate people ... very much . 
Holidays aren't the same without the kids around . There is something about them being overly enthusiastic and continually asking when we can start the fireworks that just makes everything better . Humm , what should I do now ? 
Thank you to good friends for making this 4th of July a fun one 
Hmm , nothing quite like siting outside by the fire ... with my laptop ? lol 
I love how in a matter of 24 hours I can go from relaxed and chill , to stressed out to the < PROPMALE > with a slight eye twitch . O . * Grr .... I wanna curl up in a hole with some Dr. Pepper and < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s .... 
Another piece of my phone just fell off :( 
CapriSun in hand and it's off to Neverland ... * sigh * If only , if only . 
Gha ! I guess I better get packing seeing as how I leave in a matter of 4 or 5 days for St. < PROPFIRST > and California . Man , I'm gonna be gone for 3 1/2 weeks ! My UT friends had better miss while I am gone ! ;) lol jk 
I am sooo stoked to go hike Mt . Timpanogos again ! < PROPFEMALE > J Nielsen and Jannalyn J Mower , get ready for a beautiful hike tomorrow ! <3 
Well we got 3/4 of the way up Timp and my friend couldn't breath so we headed back down . Oh well , I'll hike it all the way when i get back form CA 
Started the day hiking with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and ended it going to a movie with < PROPMALE > . I love my friends , and Despicable Me is a cute movie :) 
I love : < PROPFEMALE > Garner , < PROPMALE > Zaragoza , < PROPFEMALE > J Nielsen , and everyone in between . You guys make me smile when I don't want to or even think I can :) 
“God , < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change , the courage to change the things I can , and the wisdom to know the difference . ” -Reinhold Niebuhr 
Heh heh heh . I LOVE love love MY new backpacking tent ! I can't wait to hike Timp this week with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! We are gonna camp at < PROPFEMALE > Lake and then watch the sun rise from the tip top ! 
Ahh ... So I think I am going to go hiking once a week until the weather no longer permits me to do so . Anyone have any suggestions ( nothing too extreme or more than two nights) ? I think I might look into hiking Mt . Nebo . Anyways , can't wait to hike Timp again tomorrow , it's gonna be tiring since I am packing up a tent and such up there . 
Gha ! Hiking Timp with < PROPFEMALE > Garner was amazing ! The night up by < PROPFEMALE > lake was a little cold and so was hiking a mile through the snow and back . But we made it , safe and sound :) 
Not gonna lie , I love sore muscles , they me feel healthy :P \ 
Hmm , I don't know how I feel about my new glasses ... Guess I just need to get used to them . \ 
Ahh today is a good day , not very busy , but nice none the less . 
* Stomach growls viscously/desperately*\ 
Mmm . I would totally kill for some Taco < PROPFEMALE > right about now ! \ 
PS I declare that today is going to a spectacular day !!! 
Dear life , I love you . But you are a total pain in my butt . Ease up on the big decision making and growing up , will ya ? You know I wouldn't trade you for any other , but you seem to have a few glitches here and there . Perhaps it's time for a tune up ! All in all , thanks for the good times ! Sincerely , Kayla 
Please excuse me while I step outside and save the world ;} 
Oh money , if only you were mine ... * sigh * 
\Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems . Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano . All I know is I love you too much . \ " \ 
Wishin ' my hero a very happy birthday <3 
Lol I suppose I should get packed seeing as how I leave tomorrow morning for CA ... 
Hmm . I feel like a grown up today ... At least I feel like I've gotten stuff accomplished . \ 
\Words like butterflies\ 
Going to the beach <3 
Oh the wonderful world of life .. 
\Yearning to shower you with kisses\ 
Schoolwork = Yuck 
Missing California like none other ... But I'm here in UT with good music and good friends , so life is still amazing ! 
Went hiking and free climbing with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > up Big Cottonwood Canyon today , it was amazing :) Thanks guys !

Whatever >:(

So , I'm not taking theatre this year ( sad , I know ) .. but the question is , do I still audition for Shakespeare ? Decisions , decisions ...

I seriously feel efficient today . Woke up at a good time , sent emails , made calls , set up interviews and now it's time to do some schoolwork before I go to SLC again this afternoon . 
Back from SLC .. I feel like it's 2 am . Long day , but at least I feel like I got a lot accomplished . SLEEP !! ( PS < PROPFIRST > Margetts etts , you're the best ! ) 
My day has officially been made ... My window is open , I've got incense burning , there is rain AND thunder ... Ahhhh nothing better . 
Well here I am ... back inside the nice , warm , dry house after bailing water from the flooding window wells .... 
Yay for , new phones ! 
Little brother's birthday , best be getting to the decorating and baking . I'm gonna make him a cake that is reminiscent of Lego's . 
Good Friends + Great Music + Phenomenal Sushi = Spectacular Evening :) It was nice to get out last night . 
First day of my Senior year went pretty great . All I know is that , this year , I am going to be very Very VERY busy . 
Ugh . School just started and I've already got a cold . Ew ... I sure as heck better be fine by Monday . 
Oh the joys of laying in bed , watching football , and munching away on random things . I wish this stupid cold was gone , my entire body is aching .. Don't think I am going to make it to school tomorrow :( 
So a friend of mine got hurt today and was unconscious at the side of a well traveled road . Not a single person bothered to stop and help . I am greatly disappointed in society at the moment . I mean REALLY ? Ugh ... 
Oh the joys of crossing things off my \To Do\ " list <3 There's nothing quite like it :) " 
Can't even explain how great life is right now , I can't wait to embrace the opportunities that I have this year :) 
GHA ! Today is simply beautiful ! I love it ! Now time to do some school work . Happy Labor Day everyone ! 
I hereby declare that < PROPFEMALE > J Nielsen is prohibited from moving so far away from me :/ 
Mmm nothing like some good jazz and blues to do my homework to 
I truly hope that everyone keeps in mind those who lost their lives on this day 9 years ago , and the many who have also died since that event , fighting for this country .

I had THE BEST evening ever with Carlin < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > VanTassell < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Barker Reeve . Haha I just love you guys :} 
I just can't wait for this holiday season <3 
Hmm , I feel incredibly distracted today . 
Ugh ... I swear , all I want to do is get out of the house but there is NOTHING to do in Utah . I can just hear California beckoning me . Hey < PROPFEMALE > Barker Reeve , let's hop on our private jet and go spend an exciting day in San Fransisco ! 
Had a fabulous day filled with loin cloths and shoes <3 HAHA Love you < PROPFEMALE > Barker Reeve ! Oh and It was great to see < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ... PS Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > VanTassell < PROPFIRST > ! PPS Carlin < PROPFIRST > I miss you terribly ! 
This fire is insane .... 
Heh heh .... Glee <3 
I don't think I have ever seen the < PROPFEMALE > shine so bright , it woke me up this morning ! 
Had a spectacular day :) 
LUDO makes my mornings THAT much better :P 
I'm totally dying to get out and go backpacking ... anyone up for an adventure this weekend ? Or do you have any trail suggestions ? ( PS I AM NOT doing Timp again , so don't suggest it . I need something new ! ) 
Haha , I'm cleaning the kitchen and jammin ' out to NSYNC and The Backstreet Boys .... :D haha I should be SO socially unaccepted ..... 
Oh my gosh , there is NOTHING to do tonight ...! * grumbles in frustration * 
OH MY GOSH ! The LUDO concert is THIS FRIDAY !!!!!!! AhhHAHAHAHA ! I'm soooooooooooo --------> ooo excited !!!! <3 <3 <3 
Korn is making math class bearable today ... thank goodness for ipods ! 
So ... I just put my Latin shoes on for the first time since Spring ... It was a rather blissful reunion lol 
I like it anywhere and everywhere ! 
Soooo They kill animals for leather and trees for paper ... Does that mean they killed the Tin Man for tin foil ?! 
Hands down , best concert EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ADORE Ludo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Feeling abnormally down at the moment . I need some happy . 
You know that you have been watching too much BBC < PROPFEMALE > when your inner monologue breaks out in a British accent ... HAHA 
Today is going to be a long day . 
I had a lovely evening , and now it's off to bed :) Sweet dreams world of FB ! 
Hmm , I really need/want to carve some pumpkins !!! 
I just love my fellow DECA officers :) 
Loving this weather ... I hope it will keep raining all day long 
Gha , I just adore the movie < PROPFEMALE > <3 Puts me in a good mood ! haha . Hmm , and I am loving this weather . I kind of want to bundle up and go for a walk :) 
Wow , well goodbye fall and hello winter . GEEZ ! 
Oh my , I don't think I can express clearly just how much I LOVE check lists ... and even more , checking things OFF said check lists <3 Heh heh heh 
Rather sad that I didn't get to carve pumpkins this year , but it's okay because I've been watching < PROPMALE > Potter all day with my mom . ( Just realized that < PROPFIRST > Tennant is in the Goblet of Fire !!! ) 
I don't know how I am going to pull this off . I wish I could just lay in my room for the rest of my life , daydreaming and pondering various philosophical quandaries ... That would be quite wonderful . 
Wow ... I'm the biggest nerd I know . So , since I have nothing to do tonight ( besides homework , but that doesn't count at the moment ) , I'm sitting here coding random web pages ... for fun ... So sad , so sad . LOL I'll probably have half a website by the end of the night . 
Sitting here eating frosting ... Hmmm Probably not the healthiest thing ... but HEY ya only live once ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Garner , I LOVE YOU !!!! 
I do believe that another evening of salsa dancing is in order ? Time to put on my heals and tear up the dance floor ! 
Totally geeking out over Glee tonight . That mix of Umbrella and Singing in the Rain was AWESOME ! 
Wow ... I am shocked that I haven't been on that show , Hoarders , because I am finding some of THE MOST ridiculous things hidden in my closet ... Everyhting from fishing lures to notes from that my friends and I wrote in 6th grade to silverware . It's horrid ! 
Heh heh heh >;} 
Had a surprisingly great Thanksgiving despite being sick . < PROPFEMALE > Barker Reeve put together a WAY delicious last minute Thanksgiving dinner . Then < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > came over to keep me company and do everything that involved standing up lol Thank you guys . You are the best ever .

SO happy that < PROPFIRST > Denos and I got 1st place in the Sports & Entertainment Marketing partner role play competition ! I love DECA , it's great :)

:) This weather is making me want to go sledding and build a snowman ! I can't even remember the last time I did either of those things . 
Finally in San < PROPFIRST > ! I adore California <3 Love the company 
On our way to San Fransisco ! <3 
I have the best family ! We just drove around for 1 1/2 hrs ( the drive was supposed to be 11 < PROPFEMALE > . - my directional skills are challenged ) . Within those 1 1/2 hrs we managed to sing through the Newsies and Mama Mia Soundtracks ( even the five year old knew every word ) , get strange stares from passers by , and I took a picture in front of the < PROPFIRST > in the Box sign with a couple random Italian guys :P 
Being back in UT is bitter sweet . Hmm . I wish I could pack up a few of my friends and take them with me back to CA .

Such a productive night . I am sitting here doing schoolwork , eating left over low mein , and watching the Iron Man movies :) 
This has been one of THOSE weeks . But the weekend is going to make up for it :) 
< PROPMALE > Rice ' s ' love is my drug ' lol How do I know this ? Because I get the munchies every time he comes over ! HAHAHA 
I woke up this morning just in time to see the gorgeous sunrise and then went right back to sleep . It is SO beautiful today ! The air feels crisp and fresh . All I want to do is open all the windows and enjoy it <3 
\ ... In you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them as you < PROPFEMALE > 
I had a fabulous night , it's a beautiful day , got to go on a run , and now it's time to hit the school work . I must say this weekend is turning out to be quite a successful one :) 
\The past is gone . The future never arrives . In truth 
It's a whopping 8 degrees today and it feels like -4 with the wind ! Brr haha :) 
Ad astra per aspera 
There are no words to clearly express how incredibly happy I am that it is finally Friday . Mmm ... 
I had an overall amazing weekend . Full of great memories and lots of smiles . Can't wait for things to keep moving onward and up :) \ 
heh heh heh The English Beat , Bon Jovi , OMD , and Lady Gaga ; next month is going to have some fabulous concerts ! 
That walk was exactly what I needed . It's amazing how some fresh air and sunshine can me feel so much better . 
The Titanic .. Gha ... it gets me every time :'} 
\But what do you say to taking chances 
Finally home . State was fun . Congratulations to everyone going to Nationals ! 
Thoughts and prayers going out to all those affected by the tsunami ... 
I have loved these last couple of days ; perfect weather and amazing company ! 
Ahh . I know what I want ... A massage ... yeah , that would be lovely lol
