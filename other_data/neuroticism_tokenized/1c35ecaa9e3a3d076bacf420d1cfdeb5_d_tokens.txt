-(I have lots-a brochures ! ) Heh-Heh . Heh . \ 
Then I ran into this old jewish man . he asked me to lug his stuff . -he just got evicted . He said he'd like a pull-cart . Wasn't there when I got back . I am hoping he will go to the Food-line I told him about . 
I'm confused by all the ' strait ' people saying they are \interested in :\ " and they click \ " women AND men\ " ?! I guess i misunderstand what \ " interested in\ " means ? "
