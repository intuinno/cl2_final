Hurried to get to the doctors office on time ... just to sit and wait , and wait , and wait ... =/ 
* Warning : My brain to mouth filter has malfunctioned .... so I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm thinking * 
My son is so freakin cute and he just cracks me up .... I love just watching him sometimes ! <3 
< PROPMALE > started 3rd grade at his new school today ...... Holy crap , my son is already in 3rd grade !!! I remember his first day of pre-school like it was yesterday ... he's growing up so fast ! 
I go to the lab this morning to finish my blood work and she takes 8 viles of blood .... Really ? She really needed 8 viles !!! The whole time I'm thinking to myself \Hey I'm anemic and I need to keep as much blood as possible so if you could NOT take all of it that would be awesome !!! \"" 
* So the police decided to send me a photo of my car speeding .... so I thought I would be nice and sent them a picture of my check * 
Ahhhhh ... I love waking up knowing that I have absolutely nothing to do !!!!

I love not having to go to work .... but still getting paid !!!! Sooooo nice !!!! =D 
Well this sucks ... Im really tired & need to get some sleep , but I cant . I find that watching my son sleep next to me is very soothing and peaceful though ... <3 
In the 8 years I've worked here , I have never been this busy !!! OMG !!!!!!!!!! 
Grandpa , \ 
... Lay your head to rest in God's hands , for your time has come to leave this world .... and rest in peace knowing that you are loved , you will be missed and memories of you will be cherished . 
R.I.P. Grandpa ...... Tonight at 8:21 pm you left this world to be with God ... and although I am sad and my heart is hurting , I find some comfort in knowing your in a better place now . I love you and will miss you You will forever live on in my heart . 
So much going on with my family right now ... at least we`ll all be together soon <3 
So much going on right now ...... trying to focus on one thing at a time and stay positive .... we'll see how that goes ! 
<----- Is learning how to deal with life one day at a time ... 
<----- Is feeling somewhere between extremely happy and verysad today . Happy because both my sisters fly home today ... but sad because they are flying home for Grandpas funeral . Its strange how you can feel 2 opposite emotions at once . =) =(

<----- Had a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas this year . I am truly blessed to have such a wonderful son , loving family & awesome friends in my life ! 
<------ Doesnt want to turn another year older . 
Why does every kid toy come with 50 removable < PROPFEMALE > ass parts that get lost as soon as you get them out of the little plastic bag that has been twist tied , taped and glued to the box ?? Oh yes , i remember now ... its to annoy the hell out of the parent attempting to get it open while their kid gets more impatient ... LOL 
When it hurts to look back , and you're afraid to look ahead , just look beside you ... your true friends will be right there . =) 
Thank you all for my birthday wishes .... I love you all !!!

<~~~~ hates being sick ... especially when i'm also taking care of a sick kid , not fun ! =/ 
finds it funny how people don't want their emotions played with but they are happy to play with others ... 
HAPPINESS is knowing that no matter how bad my day has been or how bad life seems , all I have to do is see my son's smile and know that I am truly blessed <3 
... think not you can direct the course of love , for love , if it finds you worthy , directs your course .
