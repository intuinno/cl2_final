* kicks Facebook * Add the Power 106 live feed tab , damnit ! And fix the account management options so I can get in and change it so I don't get an email every time someone breathes or examines their toe jam . 

Nice ! Spell preview for Wizard101's new Lv . 58 spells when Celestia comes out . ( And sorry folks , this is what I play , so I'm not taking Farmville/Cowclick/Let's Bake Cybercake requests ! But if YOU want to play a game , make sure you use friend code S97QD-2L883-27H5M-QLL77 on Wiz101 ) XD 
Been watching the rescue of the miners in Chile pretty much all night and this morning . It's been absolutely amazing to see their resilience and bravery , not to mention the skill of all the technicians who made the rescue possible . 15 up so far , almost halfway there ! 
Have mostly rebounded from by bout with the stomach flu yesterday , and am taking the rug-rat geocaching today . Should be good times , she's loaded up with trade-toys and I'm prepared to get soaked . XD 
Celestia is on its way to live in Wizard101 , servers should be up again soon . And just got \Savior of the Spiral\ " on Kieran ONE HOUR before they went down . WOOT ! " 
Oh wonderful . A branch came down across my cable drop line and though it is still connected to the house , it is draped low across the alley . Taking bets on how long it is before someone in a pickup snags it and rips it out . Whoever gets the correct time has to give me a cookie . 
Kiddo leaves for Walt Disney World tomorrow with her dad . * sniff * Wish I was going ( especially since I paid for the %$$%&&^%$ trip ) . But we had a good day together wearing her out so she could sleep tonight ; went geocaching and found a lot of travel bugs that are taking the trip with her to the parks . The owners should get a kick out of that ! 
Well apparently , SOME VIDEO CARDS just aren't good enough for Warcrack any more . I mean seriously , mine's only 8 years old ! What do they expect me to do , UPGRADE or something like that ??? \ 
\ 
No seriously , bummer . car broke down ( nothing serious ) and now I have to get a new vid card if I want to play Cataclysm eventually . Anyone handing out free money ? 
Good times with the kiddo . . . my Ecology teacher gave me two turkeys her husband shot , so Rave and I defeathered one and I skinned the other one , leaving the wings on - essentially a big turkey feather drape with a huge wingspread . Never tried this with a bird before , so I hope I can preserve it well . We saved the wings , feet , and fan of the other one , and Rave had a blast disecting the remaining bird parts . 
Woohoo , got my predator/varmint license yesterday , two deer hides soaking in the garage to dehair , two more frozen and waiting , < PROPMALE > in the neighbor's garage for me to skin today and help butcher , ANOTHER deer on the way for the freezer ( love bonus deer ) , and permission from GFP for all the roadkill I want ( just gotta call ) . Gonna be a GOOD tanning winter ! 
Obvious note of the day : skinning a frozen deer is hard work . I'm sore as hell . But I'm gonna get some killer boots off this one ! :D 
Okay , I really hate it when apps decide what to post as \what I say \"." 
Dead as doornails here . . . then again I shot the phone , that could have something to do with it . \ 
:D 
SNOW , DAMNIT ! I don't want to go to school tonight . X ( 
Good news ! State approved LATI's new Entrepreneurship program for next year ! Bad news , 27 credits next semester so that I can be on top of the game to graduate from that one in March of 2011 . BUT it would give me two Associates in three years before going to SDSU . Something's gonna have to give , not sure what yet . ( Remind to self : beat instructor for STILL not giving me the paperwork to start my internship early . )

* flop * 
Please post a picture of your ( or someone else's ) ass for colon cancer awareness . The goal is to see nothing but asses on Facebook by January 1st . We're not sure how , but surely this will cure colon cancer for good . Repost if you are not a terrible , awful person who hates puppies . 
AND MORE ! \ 
No matter how many different friends you put on the phone , we have caller ID ; I know two really nice guys I could recommend as your personal DJ's for muchos dineros , but then I would have to work this ^%$##@%&^ shift again ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > , COME TAKE YOUR DAMN JOB BACK !!!!!! XD 
Just finished Christmas shopping ; definitely got better deals now than shopping early . Rave will be thrilled , one of her gifts is a new dart rifle like the one we have at the station . ;) 
Just so you all know , there will be a total eclipse of the < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow night ! \ 
Also so you know , there's also a winter weather advisory so we won't be able to see it . * headdesk * 
If a < PROPFIRST > Bieber song plays in the < PROPMALE > and nobody hears it , does it still suck ? 
So my < PROPFIRST > is likely totaled . . . no , not Bubo the Astro , but my Voyager that the ex drives . He was going to pick up the kiddo at school and was on the green light at the intersection by the Cowboy on north 81 when a pickup slid through the red right into him . He's fine , < PROPFIRST > is not . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > , I'm NOT available for the next couple of days ! 
AND to add to my day , my cell phone is fubar'd . If anyone needs to get a hold of me I'll watch here , or send a PM and I'll send you the land line . 
Got my replacement phone today . Then spent an hour on the phone with customer service because it came preprogrammed with some number in Tennessee . It's fixed now , so feel free to call it again . 
< PROPFIRST > is totaled ; they could replace the door , but the reinforcement cage on the drivers side is crushed and that whole side would have to be replaced . Yay . 
Good news for the ex , he got a new < PROPFIRST > today . Good deal , too ; less than $100 out of pocket and he got a bigger < PROPFIRST > with less < PROPMALE > and fully loaded , down to the DVD player in the back so the munchkin can watch movies on car trips . Not a bad deal for a total loss car accident . 
I broke . \ 
Cataclysm is damn cool . Currently running a worgen ( werewolf ) < PROPMALE > named Rhodekyll on Wyrmrest . \ 
* boogies * 
Got my school schedule rearranged ; dropped Communications and Leadership & replaced them with Microeconomics and Abnormal Psychology ( because with my friends , I need it ) . Still at 19.5 credits , so now time to rearrange my life to make it fit ! \ 
* headdesk * 
My Grammy Dody died last night . I'm sad , but she held on a good five years longer than I thought she would , and it was very much her time . 
Okay , I'm ticked . I've been waiting to see < PROPMALE > and Ree since I moved to SD ten years ago , and always miss them when they are in the area . So now I know they are at the < PROPFEMALE > Sioux next month , and on < PROPFIRST>'s Day even . And on the ONE DAY OF THE WEEK < PROPFIRST > and I have night classes we can't miss . * headdesk * 
Smelly ( aka < PROPFEMALE > the dachshund ) got spayed yesterday and came home today . Poor thing is miserable , with a pressure bandage around her gut ( she scratched a stitch loose ) and a cone on her head . I think I'll use her to shovel the walkway when she feels better . 
Alas , Smelly the Dachshund was only able to get half her stitches out today . She is cursed with the Cone of Shame for another three days . But I was right , she does make a good shovel . 
OMG it is so like , TOTALLY NICE OUT ! I should like , go do something productive and fun and like , TOTALLY ENJOY IT TO THE MAX ! \ 
* loads up Warcraft and plays for 9 hours*\ 
Hey , it's nice out in Azeroth too , you know . \ 
Actually I'm running errands , helping < PROPFIRST > ( arm out of the sling , but he's still bandaged up ) , and doing math homework . Yay . 
Two more classes . Two more classes and that is IT for Environmental Tech ! \ 
Of course there's still Algebra , Microeconomics , a summers worth of tanning and internships and finding a par t-t ime job and 2 anime cons coming up and all the other stuff . But I'll have 4 whole new hours of free time during the week to fill ! 
Another run down to SF today . . . gotta take the munchkin to Game Stop to get Celebi . Ah , what we do for that DAMN POKEDEX . 
It's a good day to make my house a home and not a square wooden box that I store my crap in . I love those days when housework is actually fun ! ( Sorry , I'm not you , < PROPFEMALE > . ;) ) 
In the \funny kids things say\ " department :\ 
Wonderful start to spring break , I got the flu . But still being the gamer at heart - and a mom - off to Wal-Mart to see if they have Pokemon Black & White out at midnight . Of course that also means in and out in 10 minutes as opposed with dealing with crowds sick tomorrow . 
\Manly Apricot\ " would be a good name for a band . " 
Well , calls have been made . . . < PROPFIRST > and I are trying to get at least one of us to Japan . We figure if we have this training , it's a waste not to use it when it is needed . 
No call yet from the Red Cross or the State Dept . Currently keeping a very close eye on Fukushima Daii'chi . :( 
Today I have been compiling a list of people who exaggerate less than South Dakotans . So far I have come up with Jewish grandmothers , televangelists , and Fox News . 
Got some bad news , ENV folks . . . < PROPMALE>'s wife did end up losing her job .
