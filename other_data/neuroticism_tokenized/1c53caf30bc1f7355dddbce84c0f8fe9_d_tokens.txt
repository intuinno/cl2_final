Going of in a little bit with the bestie . Going to watch the new movie \The Roommate\ " .. Very excited ! " 
Just got back from the movies ... Went and saw \No Strings Attached\ " instead of \ " The Roommate\ " ... I tell you that was a funny movie ... In the end someone WILL always end up falling in love with the other person ! But had a great night . Now for an intresting day tomorrow ! Loving my life as his mommy and his girlfriend ! <3 " 
Just got back from hanging out with the boyfriend ... Had an amazing day . First took Skylar to Ashlynn's birthday party and then the boyfriend took me to dinner ... Loving my life as his mommy and his girlfriend ! <3 
Cleaning the house today ... Just put Sky down for a nap .. So yay I get to sweep and mop all the floors in the house . And they say thats the small chore ! Haha yeah I don't think so . It takes forever and it kills my back ! Loving my life as his mommy and his girlfriend ! <3 
So apperently Green Bay won the Super Bowl !?! Not really sure didn't care to watch the game . Got my mystery all figured out now . Yeah it pisses me off but that just shows how immature people can acttually be ! Loving my life as his mommy and his girlfriend ! <3 
I believe everything happens for a reason . People Change so you can learn to let go . Things go wrong , so that you can learn to appeciate them when they're right . You believe lies so eventually you learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes things fall apart so better things can fall together ! <3 
&&& She's the girl with her middle finger in the air because for the first time she just don't care !!! 
There comes a point in your life when you realize who matters , who never did , who wont anymore , and who always will . So don't worry about the people from your past , there's a reason they didn't make it to your future ! <3 
Life's too precious to worry about stupid sh*t . So have fun , go party , and fall in love <3 . Say what you want to say and do what you want to do ... REGRET NOTHING ! &&& Don't let people who don't matter bring you down ! 
I may not be perfect but I am always me !! 
Judge me & I'll prove you wrong .. Tell me what to do & I'll tell you off .. Say I'm not worth it & watch where I end up ... Screw me over & I'll do it to you twice as bad ... Call me crazy & you really have no idea ! <3 
Behind every beautiful girl there is a dumbass that did her wrong and made her strong ! 
Skylar is such a big boy ... We have started the potty training and he is doing amazing !!! I am sooo proud of my little man ! Loving my life as his mommy and his girlfriend ! <3 
I don't know why we all < PROPFEMALE > on to something we're better off letting go . It's like we're scared to loose what we really don't have . Some of us say we'd rather have something than not at all , but truth is ... To have something halfway is harder than not having it at all .. 
Yes I do ... Yell at the computer , tell the tv what to do , yell at my hair brush , and talk to things that can't talk back ... But you still love me ! <3 
Everything he tells you now .. He has told me first so stop thinking your sooo special !

So yeah . I am sick of him talking to me like I am stupid ... I am not a dumb little girl . So watch what you say because it will bite you in the ass ... 
So I am sick of everyone taking his side ... Just because he is family . They say that I am to but when it comes to stuff like that they don't make me feel like I am ... Its becoming carzy . To the point where I don't feel like I belong in the place that I call home . Oh well as they say suck it up and deal with it . 
To all the unselfish moms out there who traded sleep for dark circles , salon haircuts for a ponytail , long showers for quick ones , late nights for early mornings , and designer bags for diaper bags , and wouldn't change a thing . Let's see how many moms post this who don't care what they gave up and instead , LOVE what they got in return .... Post if you LOVE being a MOM
