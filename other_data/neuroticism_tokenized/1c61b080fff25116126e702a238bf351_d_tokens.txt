For anyone who knows me or my cousin , an extremely unfortunate and tragic event has occured ... As of the afternoon of Sunday , August 2 , 2009 , my cousin < PROPMALE > has comitted ... suicide . I don't know the details , but I will post funeral information when I ge 

My poor cousin was creamated promptly after his death . I won't even get a < PROPMALE > to see him even once more in this lifetime . I could only hope to be paid a visit by his ghost or make contact via the ESP faculty . He was just there & now he is not . I have a voicemail from him that was about to expire . I don't think I will let it go for sometime because I will never hear him speak again . I'm in a blur & in shock still . 
The memorial service will be in < PROPFEMALE > , Kentucky . It will be this upcoming Saturday . 
< PROPFIRST > is depressed right now ... 
Of to an appointment ! Time for my job ! Time to work ! Life is some good but also suckish right now , slow and boring . Laidback and dull . C'est La vie ! 
You'll never guess !!! O.o ! Look who I'm with ! The awsomest statesman in the US !... < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > !!! Ye haw ! 
Hella lotta reading to get through within the week ! Project on human achievement is getting crazy ! 
Ooops 
Feeling a little creepy right now ... < PROPFEMALE > Red opening music is perfect for right now ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbhMr9cabnA 
Sorry This is the link to the movie : http://www.watch-movies.net.in/play_new.php?si=264243&s=1&tra_st=0&u=aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5tZWdhdmlkZW8uY29tJTJGdiUyRlFRSVRTOUgzJTI2YXV0b3BsYXklM0Qx&host=megavideo 
Hello all ! Fantastic news ! I turn 19 tomorrow at 6:13 AM !!! Yay ! Cheers ! 
I HAD A FUNNY ACCIDENT ... OOPS ! : < PROPFIRST > tried one of the health recipies for the juicer . It called for 4 carrots , a leek , and 2 cloves of garlic . He mistook a bulb as a clove and added two bulbs of garlic instead . He drank it anyway despite the mistake . He drank around 26 cloves worth of garlic juice . 
I feel really bad for everyone at handbell choir tonight because of me smelling like a garlic bulb . I can't get the scent on my breath to go away and now it's coming out of my pores . At least I'm really really germ and virus and parasite resistant now . 
Going to my brother's concert tonight , he's in treble choir . This should be nice . He will feel supported :) 
Very fried/frizzed . Building human chess mat for chess elective @ summer camp(shss ! Don't tell anyone ) . Little boys playing chess with foam swords ! Scary thought ! Spent 3 hours milling around home depot comparing flooring options ! All the workers talking to me ! Inefficient ! gaba ! Gaba ! GABA ! Too much of it darling ! Too much ! Building human chess is very time consuming in shopping time . 
I am so mean to my sister , I love to turture her and make her feel like no one cares about her , thats why I ditched her today haha 
Just got back from job interview and I'm anxious to know if I get the job anytime soon . Cafe < PROPFEMALE>'s! in Baltimore city ! Nice little nichey cafe inside the University of < PROPFEMALE > hospital . Can't wait to learn to work that damn espresso machine ! The bite of that darn Cafe Mocha is just as amazing as the growl of the white foam ! 
A fantastic Fall Tour and it was a certainly fascinating and interesting one at that . Wish it could have been a bit longer ... wish the bus time also was a LOT longer , wanted to get more reading in . 
Finished my chem . for today , didn't get to the math that I needed to do . Widor's Toccata from 5th Symphony is going wonderfully ! Getting < PROPFEMALE > of it despite the level of difficulty of the piece itself aside from the < PROPFIRST > Fox style of it ! 
Need a haircut so so bad . Am concerned about not getting the stylist I want since no one can do it like her . I haven't been that big about that like say ... a girl , but ... I was that impressed . My curly hair strands while pulled out are nearly 5 inches . 
Royally annoyed and royally drained ... emotionally and mentally and no clue why . I need more connection with people . I miss my friends .

If you ever get to see the intro that goes with this music to the movie , then please do it because this is just plain weird and artistic and creative and wishful thinking . It's strange , but in a very good way : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8yygOkG7qM
