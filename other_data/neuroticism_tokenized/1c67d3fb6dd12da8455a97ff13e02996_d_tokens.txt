Mom's gone for a week , my cousin is here for a week , there are no little boys around ... What am I gonna do for a week with my grandparents and two 14 yr old boys ?

Is is bad that I get a happy high from being in the school library ? 
First day of classes went well tomorrow I have the class I'm really worried about : Basic College Algebra , my professor Xionghui He 
Math class today went well . Now I can't wait till tomorrow when I get my laptop !!!! EEEEEP ! 
this is my first post from my new laptop ! I am sitting here in the school library listening to two of my theater peeps discussing a game as I sit quietly in my corner chair worring about my Algebra homework thats due tomorrow night . I love the smell of the books in here ! Oh I also spent 20 cents to get four pages copied out of a book I need for Expository Writing . that was fun 8 } oh such goes college life . 
Is finding strangely enough that I love sonnets ! 
Does Anybody Hear Her by Casting Crowns is one of the truest yet saddest song I have heard in a long time . 
Trying to find a short ( one minute ) monologue from a Greek or Shakespearean play is harder than it seems . Of course it also doesn't help that I only have two plays of Shakespeare and no Greek plays at all . Oh well to the library I go tomorrow . 
Convocation tomorrow at school ... 
Early morning dentist visit that resulted in two more appointments for small cavities . And now just killing time at the Library on campus . W00T !! 
is such a nerdy college girl 
Eating cause I know I need to not really cause I'm hungry ... :/ 
Is in a play at < PROPFEMALE > !!! October 4 and 5 . All my local peeps need to come see it !! 
chilling till class at 6 ... actually kinda bored ... nap time 
Ah back at school after a long weekend ... BLECH !!! Oh well I got to see < PROPFEMALE > this weekend and that making today a little easier . Life is good :) 
Rehearsal for Metamorphoses tonight ... 8- ? and I was told last < PROPFEMALE > so I don't have my script , again ... Bother :P 
To All my < PROPFEMALE > Peeps .... my cell phone has been disconnected and I will not have service if you need to contact me shoot me a message on here or email me sarah.watson@bethelu.edu . I will be checking frequently through out the day . 
' s cell phone is working again !! 
Sitting in COE ( College orientation experience ) waiting for class to start 
Chillin in the commuters lounge on campus :) 
Got a call from a Clearwater FL ... weird ... 
is learning that it is all to easy to stretch yourself thin in college ... :/ 
Home resting , rest that is desperately needed ... ZZZzzz 
Feels like she probably just failed her algebra test :( 
Finally gets to rest a little :D yayness !!! 
Has lots of deep thinking to do ... :/ 
finds it funny that in COE most of us are on FB and not paying any attention to roll call :P 
wonders why some people are so controlling : ? 
Lovin ' life , livin ' good :) 
Ok so evidently its Banned Book Week ( Sept . 25- Oct . 2 ) One school in California pulled The Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and are considering putting a permanent ban on it . Why ? because a parent complained when a child came across the term \oral sex \"." 
I love coe , i love coe , i love coe ... a forget it I hate this class ! 
Dentist Appointment , check . Deliver Greek-o-Gram at 1:30 . Costume team meeting at 3 . Driving school at 6 . Play rehearsal at 8 ... nah today is a lazy day ... 
long weekend but it was fun ! Excited for Metamorphoses tonight ! All my local people need to come see it , especially if you are in < PROPFEMALE > or on < PROPFEMALE > Campus ! I'll be looking for you . ;) 
Has way to much fun being a social psychologist to my friends :) 
Guess what I just shut my keys in my trunk ! Oi this is a wonderful start to my day ! 
Enjoys being able to ask my tutor for help with math !! 
Do you remember we were standing there in your front yard ? You put your arms around me for the first time , You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter , You are the best thing that's ever been mine . 
I like it next to my shoes ! :) 
Life is awesome !! ( How much sarcasm can I put in this post ? ) I am so frustrated with bad businesses .... >_< 
Be\ 
careful of making a woman cry because God counts her tears . Woman was \ 
created from man's rib , not from the feet to be trampled on or the head \ 
to be superior , but from the side to equal , under the arm to be \ 
protected , and next to the heart to be LOVED 
Is not really looking forward to 3 tests , 2 of them mid-terms tomorrow :/ 
Watching Criss Angel Mindfreak on Netflix :)
