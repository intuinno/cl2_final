likes how < PROPFEMALE > and I are so easily swayed . Once high school's over she'll have crabs on her eyebrows and genital warts , and I'll have herpes and be addicted to crack . O: 
: My phone's turned off . Please don't text or call . I'll have a new phone by Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest . (: Toodles ! <3 
I think that the only reason people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that don't change ; when everyone else does . <3 
Message me < PROPFIRST > ! I got a new phone and lost everyone's . D: 
I believe the sun should never set upon an argument , I believe that junk food tastes so good because it's bad for you . I believe in < PROPFEMALE > , what you give is what you get returned . I believe you can't appreciate real love ' til you've been burned . I believe the grass is no more greener on the other side , I believe you don't know what you've got until you say goodbye . <3

Dance there upon the shore ; what need have you to care for wind or water's roar ? And tumble out your hair that the salt drops have wet ; being young you have not known the fool's triumph , nor yet love lost as soon as won , nor the best labourer dead and all the sheaves to bind . What need have you to dread the monstrous crying of wind ? 
\Don't do anything you wouldn't want to explain to the paramedics . \ " <3 " 
\You were born an original . Don't die a copy . \ " <3 " 
I'm tired . :) Hit me up and we'll make plans for break , yeah ? :D 
\The doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live . \ " <3 " 
\Being happy doesn't mean everything's perfect . It means you've decided to look beyond the imperfections . \ " <3 "
