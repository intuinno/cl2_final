Heading to Morgantown this afternoon to see my babyyy <3 Gosh , I can't wait till he gets here ! 
My little man weighs 4lbs 1oz !! <3 He's breech and thanks to the shape of my uterus he probably won't turn around and I'll have to have a c-section , but they've agreed to wait until I go into labor .... and it's looking more and more like he'll make it full term !! :D He wouldn't keep his foot out of his face for any good pics (( LOL )) but if we make it 3 more weeks we're gonna try again . I can't wait ! <3
