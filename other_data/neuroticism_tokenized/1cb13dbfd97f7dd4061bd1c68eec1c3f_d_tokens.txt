back on base 
good to see the cold followed me down here 
well thats awesome that some shipmates can forget they have watch so i have to stay in the building until 1 when i have an ACT in the morning ... damn im glad im not a piece of garbage 
should be illegal to be up this early on a saturday 
next time i say i want to take the ACT someone please punch me square in the face 
Go Navy , Beat Army 
since the Redskins beat the raiders , and the raiders beat the steelers , the Redskins are therefore better than the steelers , which i dont know if you all noticed but they won the superbowl last year ... Go Redskins 
damn you room inspectors , my room is the cleanest its ever been , i dusted LAST NIGHT how the hell do i get a dust hit ? seriously this place is way better than marginal 
garbage , i did not get that low on that damn exam 
the bengals are having a great season but they are paying like hell for it 
if it snows over a foot and stafford Christmas would have officially come a week early 
alright so its official i get to come home for christmas , took long enough to finally let me know 
this storm has turned a 7 1/2 hour drive home into a 3 day trip , also < PROPFEMALE > you should be embarrassed . the roads are impassable , you had all night to at least get some form of salt down , instead you sat there with your thumb up your ass , congratulations on making the situation 100 times worse than it needed to be 
beer , pizza , and football good to be on leave 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , in a related note for people on the fence about joining , PETA is anti-Christmas , i.e. communist 
if the redskins win tonight and prevent the cowboys from making the playoffs i will go on record as saying that the season was a success 
just remember zorn , the world needs burger flippers 
it is ridiculously cold outside 
wrecked my test this morning ( i believe ) excited to hear the results , damn you power school for delaying them until the day is over 
it makes perfect sense that the day i get to wear my warm uniform ( tomorrow ) is going to be the warmest day of the week , friday on the other hand , is supposed to be the coldest day of the week .... awesome 
hey cold weather , knock it off , you are bugging the world 
headed to the dive for a few tasty drinks and some football .... life is good 
if you say that global warming is true i want you to ball your fist up and punch yourself square in the nose right now 
i wish horrible things on the cowboys 
back to work 
super excited to get the swine flu tomorrow 
wow just took a 2 hour nap and didnt even mean to , now i get to go study for 2 hours

biggest bunch of garbage in a football game ever 
just want to say that i love snow the most and it just figures that as soon as i move to SC that Va gets its snowiest winter on record . 
fantastic , bein sick and this close to the weekend 
toyota figured out a way to save the planet , by killing you 
the new facebook is dumb 
getting motivated to clean is very difficult 
the colts have a terrible defense that is about to be exposed in front of the entire world 
why does no one ever listen to me ? 
yeah its snowing in SC Go ahead liberals , try and tell me how this is actually global warming in disguise 
funny story from last night : come home from the bar in the snow only to discover the power out , but of course i had had a few so i needed to make sure the power was on so i flipped every light switch , turned everything on , still no power , needless to say I was quite amused this morning when i woke up to find EVERYTHING on in my room 
probably could of guessed that was gonna happen 
is the best 
people say its valentines day , i say its Daytona 500 day 
that was an amazing race , hot damn im glad racing is back

Go Redskins , people in this area really do not appreciate me wearing my jersey and i do not give a damn 
swings is not all that fun 
im off for a sunday and of course the redskins game isnt on tv up here 
i hate how all DMV's make you jump through more hoops than a poodle at a dog show 
im fairly certain this is the only program where you can have a bbq at 4am while sober and no one would think of it as odd 
This phone is ridiculous 
mids are awful 
its november 8th and my truck , driveway , and yard are covered with snow 
Midget wrestling 
Its unfortunate that the cowboys had to fire the stay-puff marshmellow man 
The weather up here is almost as bass ackwards as < PROPFEMALE>'s 
They are playing a college football game in wrigley field on saturday , and they only get to use one endzone .... this isnt even a joke 
Wow michigan I don't even understand why you put a defense on the field cause they don't do anything 
Somebody needs to spin < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Go Redskins 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is a cheater 
To all the cowboys fans who are happy about their win over the lions , you are still a terrible team 
Advancement results are out and I have no idea how to check them 
Made E5 
Told you the cowboys were still terrible 
Happy thanksgiving everyone 
Go < PROPFEMALE > 
Haha boise state you lost 
boring night around the apartment 
Damn it why isn't the redskins game on up here
