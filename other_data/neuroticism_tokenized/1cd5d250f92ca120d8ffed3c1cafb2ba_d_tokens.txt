So , my little blood vessel friend on my ring fnger has decided that it wants to grow into an aphex twin . No so fast , chump . Hand doctor in 2 days . 
I don't like waking in the night in panicked sweat . There has to be a way to turn off problem solving while you sleep . ~ K 
\I've got blood on my hands 
\I'm blind 
I really am amazed at how dumb my kind is and how we are so easily taken advantaged of . 
Well Vic , life is better without so many liars around . It's tough to know someone's intentions when they are never truly honest about anything with you ; and then smash your face in when they are done with you . 
\I turned over . And i opened my eyes . And saw it was a new day . \ 
Garden is planted . Tan is started ( deck now gets over 2 more hours of direct sunlight ) . Hoping for a fresh start on a lot of things and vacation weeks are a great time to do that . 
Vacation's could start better when its not dreary out . At least it's always < PROPFEMALE > in the gym . 
When knew talking to the supervisor would be so beneficial ? 
< PROPFIRST > Cox Global 375 - Live Mix .... this is h0t ! 
Perhaps after today's events , a < PROPFEMALE > amount of uncertainty will fade and I will be able to sleep a little bit \ 
better ? I could only be so lucky . ~ K 
Finally on vacation . 
Take some ZMA and go to sleep !!! 
is about to buy a new HD and put my existing C : drive out of its \ 
misery .... clickclickclick , poppoppop , grindgrindgrind , \ 
cracklecracklecrackle , i hate you 
Just when u thought the Northeast Ohio summer curse was over , looks like another < PROPFEMALE > set of weekdays followed by a rainy weekend ! 
Happy bday , sis . You are so pale compared to me ... all that vampire fan fiction makes you ghastly ! 
I finally did a 300lb deadlift today . 
\i think i'd be better off alone . \ 
\The small hand slowly ticks a way\ 
Does not like Coconut Records \West Coast \"" 
After having done some rather insane things over the past few weeks , taking a dip in a chilly pool seems so less risky

Lyrics to songs sure do seem more potent after a few drinks 
Any1 else uncertain if conversations/txt msgs during dreams actually happened cause it didnt seem like a dream ? 
Ugh , That stupid \haunt me\ " song is stuck in my head . " 
< PROPFIRST > Fortier Bedrock Mix 2002 . Makes me feel like I'm at Abbasso . 
Mininstry's cover of Sharp Dressed Man is .. awesome ! 
< PROPFIRST > DeRosa on women : when a women says she wants a regular guy it means they like < PROPMALE > Pitt when he plays a regular guy in movies . 
< PROPFIRST > DeRosa on women : that's the other thing , they just fcuking say whatever . 
Perfect day for sun and autumn picture taking . 
In the words of the great < PROPFIRST > Cumia , \i'm on vacation \"" 
Ah , goth/ebm night at Sanctum . Money was spent on this place to goth it up good ! 
It's too bad it's so difficult to convert the beauty/emotion/majesty/intensity of music into visual < PROPMALE > . 
checked out the SAW 3D soundtrack , i think the I-Exist \Fire Fly\ " track stood out the most then Kopek \ " Love is Dead\ " then Nitzer Ebb and Boom Boom Satellites " 
Slay me 
zombie hop 
Tricks and treats , tis a smidge bright to be spooky and pass out < PROPFEMALE > 
so sad to plan the last SAW outing :(

one day till SAWshi !!

After tendons ripping from forearms and finger surgery , it's time to get back to 300

friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6th ) , there should be no \ 
human faces on Facebook but a stash of memories . This is to help raise \ 
awareness for eliminating violence against children 
Just got home from a fun night , great dinner , food coma , sleep to let the snow stop :) Darn u lactose !

Listening to Monster Magnet \Powertrip\ " album " 
\Good news everyone ! \"" 
I nearly forgot how much i enjoy progressive , listening to Pure Behrouz on SXM 
I'll never learn 
“The ‘futures’ and ‘careers’ for which American students now prepare are for the most part intellectual and moral wastelands . This chrome-plated consumers’ paradise would have us grow up to be well-behaved children . But an important minority of men and women coming to the front today has shown they will die rather than be standardized , replaceable , and irrelevant . ” –Mario Savio 
The adventures of thin mustache and whiny girl .. Shut up !!! 
the funny thing about someone sending you nothing in the mail is that youre never sure which day it arrived . 
this time of year reminds of not so holiday music , Orbital and Autechre , that year i got the < PROPMALE > and the NPG cassette , Nirvana's Nevermind , < PROPFEMALE > Jam's Vitalogy and Merkinball single , Digital Underground's \Kiss You Back\ " . anyone else have music wired to the holiday season that isnt quite so < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE >?"

Do any of us really know everybody on our friend list ? Here is a task for you . I want all my FB friends to comment on this status about how you met me . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . You will be amazed at the results you get ! :) 
kactuar 
fyi : due to previous experiences , any text messages I receive of \nice\ " or \ " right\ " will be seen as malicious and mean spirited " 
If you wrote it on paper I would read it 
It's gonna feel good to finish up the Tyr Sessions , so many tales to tell . 
Brrr 
Not happy with the blue and green mix on my tricep tattoos . The blue reminds me of a crayon I once saw . They are old tattoos and could use a change . 
I'm cutting back on the Tyr Sessions , it takes too much of my time to make so many . 
It was good to find out what some of my supposed friends thought of me . I'll keep that in mind should i ever see any of them again . 
does anyone want a bottle of Makers < PROPFIRST > whiskey ? i dont drink it 
probably shouldnt work on Tyr Session 5 when im in a bad mood , i tend to not like anything i hear at all . 
Fair warning : heading to the Chamber on the 18th . they finally got rid of Darknave and his one trick playlist pony and play new stuff i dont know and stuff from my Sessions . will be nice to get away from the top 40/rap BS that every bar seems to play . feel free to join in the fun . 
Aggrivated tendonitis in forearms , check . Lower back strain , check . Needing to stretch a lot each day , yup . It must be an off week from the gym . 
with a devil on each shoulder ... 
I'm really looking forward to those first few warm nights before there are bugs ... 
finally took my car-copter to the shop i trust to get an estimate , my poor CV joints have seen many rail road track and pot hole battles 
I'd rather be a \duck\ " than a sociopath that lies to everyone's face and hides behind a computer screen . Burp . " 
Tomorrow seems fun : \THE HEAVIEST SNOW SHOULD OCCUR BETWEEN 5 AM AND 10 AM WHEN SNOWFALL RATES COULD REACH 2 INCHES PER HOUR ... SNOWFALL AMOUNTS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON OF 7 TO 10 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE . A FEW LOCATIONS MAY SEE AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF A FOOT . WINDS WILL ALSO INCREASE BY FRIDAY MORNING TO AT LEAST 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS UP TO 35 MPH . THIS WILL CAUSE BLOWING AND DRIFTING WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON . \"" 
bwahahaha , srsly say bye bye to someone at the table but no 1 else ? i better not hear a f'ing peep about anything , not one of the of < PROPFEMALE > lies or other sociopathic BS's ever again or u r truly thee most pathetic person of all tyme 
based recent calculations , i think there is only one person on Team Duck , a whole bunch on Team Bitch and an overwhelming majority on Team Sociopath 
A good day to get up to 345x6 on deadlift . Definately tracking toward easy 405 by September . 
the enemy of my enemy is my ... 
Funny thing happens when the sunshine is gone , one looks at the world with dead lights 
yes , the rain may be converting to snow and that will not stop me from grilling a steak for tonight and some hot dogs for tomorrow :) 
Next topic : energon cubes . Discuss . 
i know i shouldnt miss someone who doesnt miss me ; i just seem to be so easily reminded of her when i hear pop songs and think of her singing them :\\ 
fyi , there is war in Libya now . Ten countries backed the < PROPFEMALE > resolution , five abstained , and none voted against it ... < PROPFEMALE > Security Council approves a no-fly zone over Libya and authorised ' all necessary measures ' to protect civilians from attacks by the Gaddafi regime .
