Fact #9 :\ 
When i scrunch up my face , a heart appears between my eyebrows . 
I have come to the conclusion that tonight was the best night of my life <3 
GO AHEAD , Take chances . Tell the truth . Date someone totally wrong for you . Say no . Spend all your cash . Get to know some one random . Be random . Say I love you . Sing out loud . Laugh at stupid jokes . Cry . Apologize . Tell someone how much they mean to you . Tell a jerk what you thin k . Laugh until your stomach hurts . Live life . Regret nothing . 
2 funerals in a matter of a few days . I hate crying rivers :'( \ 
Ill miss you aunt < PROPMALE > 
Life itself is not easy , but if you keep trying you end up succeeding . Never give up on people or anything and learn from your mistakes .

Beauty&The Beast 
Sorry im not talking to you right now , im pretending to have a life . 
I love how the weekend that im the most busy , everyone wants to hangout with me . :/ 
<3 Happy Valentines Day .!! <3 
I'm not stubborn , my way is just better . 
Don't dwell on the past , that was yesterday ... Don't worry about the future , that's tomorrow ... Live for today , it's a gift , that's why it's called the present .

Sometimes , the smallest things take up the most room in your heart <3 
I kind of want to tag someone in a random photo , just so i can pissed them off because their banner is ruined . :D
