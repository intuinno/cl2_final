If your Dad is a hard working man and is your hero , helped you no matter how bad you were or was just the BEST DAD EVER . If you are blessed to still have your DAD or if he is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are PROUD of your Dad . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one DAD !
