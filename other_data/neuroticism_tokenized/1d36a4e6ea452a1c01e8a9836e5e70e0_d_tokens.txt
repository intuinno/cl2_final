Money is the root of all evil , but if you have no money then society will scorn you . The less evil you have , the less people will think of you . Welcome to Earth . 
It would take around 24 bilion dollars to solve world hunger . Americans spend about 42 billion annually trying to lose weight . Makes ya think .

Before you criticize someone , you should walk a mile in their shoes . That way , when you criticize them , you're a mile away and you have their shoes . 
A checkride ought to be like a skirt , short enough to be interesting but still be long enough to cover everything . 
Stupid plane's taking forever ... 
2:30 am and I can't sleep . And I have to work at 6:30 ... 
Remade that prop 3 damn times ... Seriously need a new computer . 
I hate mirrors ... 
Polygons , Verticies , Edges , Borders , Meshes , Tesselation , Smoothing , Shading , Baking , Dragging , Dropping , Cloning , Boolean , Operands , Coordinates , Pivots , Rules , Tape , Hierarchies , Modifiers , and Sleep . And of these sleep is the least ...

There's a war going on for your mind . If you are thinking , you are winning . 
When you think about it , the F-22 is a pretty red neck solution . \Just give \ 
OMG IT'S FULL ON DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKY !!! 
DO A BARREL ROLE ! 
Lyrics challenge :\ 
Stupid people do stupid things , Smart people outsmart each other . \ 
Then themselves , then themselves . 
The F-22 is too expensive ? Think of how many F-22's we could have bought with our 1trillion+ spent on our favorite little war ... 
mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
It's so hot out , I set myself on fire to cool down . 
I don't have time to bleed . 
10pm and it's still 90 degrees in my apartment , and the AC is broken ... 
< PROPMALE > , IFR does not mean \I follow railroads \"......" 
If the world should blow itself up , the last audible voice would be that of an expert saying it can't be done . 
The human eye is an amazing thing , with only a little effort it can choose not to see even the most glaring injustice .

Why did the spy cross the road ? \

In Soviet Russia , Party finds you ! 
I like when you make yourself something , set it down , and forget about it , only to find it later . It's like surprising yourself with a present . 
OMG , it's a full on double rainbow all the way across the sky !!! What does this mean ? It's so bright , so vivid ! 
Finally figured out what I want to do with my Commercial license . Only problem is it costs $ 840,000 ... 
You just kept talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one had a < PROPMALE > to interrupt it was really quite hypnotic ... quite hypnotic .

As a kid I never wanted to grow up , I was scared of needing to act like and adult and having to work for a living . But then I decided to be a pilot . Problem solved . 
Today is a dangerous day for operation doublecross . 
I think this winter will be good to me , I don't know how , but it will . 
I don't know how much time has passed , \ 
All I know is that it feels like forever , \ 
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home , \ 
Sitting all alone inside your head . 
Ugh , it's 12:30 am , running on 2 hours of sleep in the last 48 , and I'm starting to sound like the great cornholio laughing at the word \portfolio \"..." 
It's one of those night ... again . 
HOW CAN IT BE SO BIG !!!!!!!!!! 
I'm bored , someone want to play some racquetball ? 
I now know that they know , and knowing that means the finals days of operation doublecross are upon me . 
I like the fact that when I sneeze , all the paints , thinners , cleaners , fillers , and the ketchup , all shake and try to run off my desk . 
RAGE MODE ENGAGE !!!!!! 
I live in a world which you may not understand . It is mostly normal , much like yours I'm sure , but we have some ... er ... let's just say they are charaters . But pay no mind , for we are most glad you have decided to join us . I do hope you decide to stay for quite a long time , and I am sure my master would just love to have you for dinner . 
Forgot I got red paint on my hands so when I went to scratch my nose the red caught my eye and I immediatly grabbed for some paper towels to stop the blood :| 
People die when they are dead . That's the way it should be . But you don't listen to that do you ? You think you're something special ? You're sick ! 
Sometimes when no one is around , I like to dress up in a suit , watch < PROPMALE > Hanks movies , and binge on dark choclate like a jackass . Ok , not really , but it would be hella sweet . 
Slowly destroying myself , one day at a time ... 
You now realize that , at some point , that aircraft was flown by a new pilot . \ 
Fresh into his unit , the aircraft was as much of a part of his being as his hands , feet , or even heart . \ 
He spent his entire career in that aircraft , through thick and thin . It almost becomes a friend . \ 
The government rips it away from the pilot when he becomes \too old\ " for them . \ 
... and actually be able to hold pleasant conversation with her . And not that fucking triple Z-cup nonsense . A good fucking healthy handful of breast . And a brain to go with those delicious mounds ... \

After playing GT5 for a while , I think I might finally be moving away from PC and getting a PS3 . 
Drove for 12 hours today , but still found a few hours to check out the AF Air & Space Museum . Who woulda guessed the F-22 is so small , and that the Global Hawk is so ... well ... HOW CAN IT BE SO BIG !?!?!?!?
