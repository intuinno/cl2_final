Every friday from here until the end of ' Jersey Shore ' Season 3 , I will be posting a haiku recapping the episode that has just aired . A Haiku review if you will . Starting now :\ 
\ 
< PROPFIRST > is a bitch\ 
Jwoww straight laid her ass out\ 
< PROPFEMALE > needs AA 
gloomy monday 
2 converging squares = 1 triangle 
how is one supposed to respond to \Cold enough for ya ? \ " God I hate when people ask me that . " 
this weeks Jersey Shore haiku review :\ 
Vinny stole < PROPFIRST>'s smoosh\ 
< PROPFIRST > whined on the board walk\ 
First family dinner 
last night , trying to help someone recall my name I gave the hint that it was a ' weather condition ' he then proceeded to call me ' partly-cloudy ' . I think I might have a new nickname . 
Bonus J Shore Haiku :\ 
Snookie hit the sauce , \ 
public intoxication\ 
is her police charge 
there is a super cute , super sweet black adolescent < PROPFEMALE > hanging around my place . He would be a great cat for someone to adopt . He's doing good living in the outdoors but he is so sweet he deserves a really great home . He's very healthy . let me know if you need some < PROPFEMALE > love 
whats with my status updates only lasting a day now ? is that a new profile thing ? 
raisinets ftw 
the Syfy original movie ' Weather Wars ' is testing my < PROPFEMALE > and my organizational skills 
your J shore Haikus ( I decided that since the show is in 3 acts , so should the Haikus ... be ): \ 
Snooki has been freed ! \ 
In the drinking arena , \ 
she's pumping the brakes . \ 
Jwoww finds Rodger\ 
The boys find bizarro Ron\ 
Snooks finds her Juice head\ 
< PROPMALE>'s a total douche , \ 
He left those poor dogs alone . \ 
Plus , stole all her shit ! 
I've got a case of the Mondays for real 
cudos to < PROPMALE > on his delicious hump day Bento Box lunch 
I love when netflix creates a category just for me . Today its :\ 
\Critically-acclaimed Visually-striking Violent movies\ " \ 
my J shore Haikus comin at cha :\ 
Sammi caught < PROPMALE > creep , \ 
or so she thought , < PROPMALE > got pissed . \ 
C-section scar bitches ! \ 
Jwoww sees < PROPMALE>'s tears\ 
Sammi delivers a punch\ 
in the end , they're friends . \ 
< PROPFIRST > told the barber , \ 
\ < PROPFIRST > na gives < PROPMALE > trombones ! \ " \ 
I just realized that the vast majority of my friends have tattoos . Since I don't have any I guess that makes me a non-conformist . Sweet irony . 
I don't much care for going to see bands play anymore . As soon as I get there I smell like smoke , have beer spilled on my feet , then have to stand for 2 hours only to leave with a headache , ringing ears and a much lighter wallet . Over it . 
Quick !! get on netflix and watch ' Slam ' on streaming before it expires tomorrow . Amazing . 
Its weird to check your feed and see people that are in bizarre cults making status updates about it . Makes me feel a little less crazy at least . 
< PROPFEMALE > cold 
J shore haikus :\ 
If you want Deana , \ 
you need a < PROPFEMALE > ticket . \ 
wait , no never mind . \ 
Stalkers everywhere\ 
Snookie found a close talker . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > is just weird\ 
< PROPFIRST > got wasted , \ 
It was proctology time . \ 
Never drink and poop . 
\New Iberia is a terrible place 
\I just wanna say ' hey guy in the band who's job it is to play the iMac ' f**k you ! \ " \ 
my post about global warming got 75 comments ! I win at facebook ! 
Thank you Rip < PROPFIRST > , our holiest father for raining down your love upon us like < PROPFEMALE > strips of party paper . We praise you . 
your Jersey shore haiku :\ 
< PROPFIRST > versus Sitch\ 
He didn't follow bro code\ 
forgiveness was had . \ 
< PROPFIRST > broke it off\ 
< PROPFIRST > and the girls got wild\ 
dude broke her glasses . \ 
It was time to go\ 
< PROPFIRST > wanted her to stay , \ 
bye < PROPFIRST > sweetheart . 
V day happiness 
personally I think the best editor < PROPFIRST > should have gone to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > for ' 127 Hours'\ 
I mean , come on . 
kinda like \what now ? \ " kinda like \ " so much to do ! \ " weird " 
hummm so the girl from ' the ring ' is also < PROPFEMALE > from ' < PROPFIRST > darko ' . hmmm 
Just realized that I'm like 3 weeks behind on my J-shore haikus . Boo , I've been busy . I'll be back on it this thursday . 
15 hour work day ? sure why not . Lundi gras fail 
24hours at work ! a new record ! 
If I don't follow all the rules in this story book written when people thought the earth was flat then I might theoretically go to a fictional place that is bad ? Thanks for the advice . 
jealous of all the spring cleaning statuses , I can't wait to tackle my house after I finish this editing next week . 
\the empire strikes back\ " is one of the best films ever made " 
Japan is now 16 feet closer to the U.S. And the earth has been knocked 6 and a half inches off it axis , incase you were wondering why the days are now 1.6 microseconds shorter since the earthquake . 
came home to find that < PROPMALE > had attempted to cut his own hair , long story short I had to buzz him down to virtually nothing . Not a good look for someone who's head is too large for hats . 
after seeing sucker punch :\ 
me : \you get no more chances < PROPMALE > Snyder ! \ " \ 
If you take solace in the thought that there is no higher power or meaning to life then you are free to truly experience it and manifest your own meaning . 
I'm a banana :) 
jajajajajajaja\ 
thats spanish for hahahahaha 
Why the F**k are they remaking ' Susperia' ? I'm about to boycott all remakes 
< PROPMALE > lost the contest :( thanks to everyone that helped out .
