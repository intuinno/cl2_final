finally decided to start my research paper for Rodak 
I finally got home from LA 
I wish I were Russian ... 
Turns out that I'm a 16th Scottish , 4th < PROPFEMALE > , a little less than half Czech , and possibly 8th-or-more Russian . 
Just changed the language setting on facebook to English ( Pirate ) . It wins SO MUCH 
At my house with my cousins , watching Hetalia all over again . Still amazing ^^ 
PAAASSSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!! 
Missing someone , it's almost making me an emotional wreck ... 
Changed my mind about trust , and who I like . Ah , well I was screwed anyways . 
Is ready to celebrate Finland-mas no matter what she feels :) 
Popularity is overrated . 
missing those days ... 
Saw 2012 , it was awesome :) I liked how half of the recurring characters were Russian lol 
Just realized how weird my family is . My mom blew up pasta , my grandma talks in third person 90% of the time , and I ran into a pole this morning , which is a normal occurance for me . 
Realized how ridiculous it is when you know just about every question about government and politics your teacher can ask . 
... is it weird if historical fiction is your favorite genre of book ? 
Had to do 1 1/2 hours of dance in freaking skinny jeans . I got three 1 minute breaks :( 
found out about Canyon Crest Academy and is really interested in going there for high school .. 
I feel lost and awkward , like I'm gonna trip over my feet and land comically on my face . 
I got < PROPFEMALE > Stone Japanese ;_; 
Happy birthday < PROPMALE > 
CAN'T WAIT ' TILL JANUARY 20TH . 
havent been here in ages O.o 
I think Russia's feeling very threatened right about now . 
Proud supporter of < PROPMALE>'s Plan To Take Over The World Via Communism . 
FUNIMATION GOT HETALIA , WOO-HOO 
Did I mention how amazing my dad is at using eBay ??

WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF . 
I need to save up $182 ASAP D: 
Might possibly be going on a plane to Sacramento by myself in September . And then home . MORE MONEY D: 
OHMYGAWD I FOUND RUSSIA'S CHARACTER CD SONGS OMGOMGOMG THEY'RE AMAZING * idied * 
Just signed up for Comic-Con :D 
Can't get fabric today because of the rain , of course :( 
\If you be my < PROPFEMALE > I'll be your sky you can hide underneath me and come out at night when I turn jet black and you show off your light I live to let you shine I live to let you shine \"" 
Finally went fabric shopping , can't wait to sew ! Made more money , only $98.98 needed now . 
Having a crush on more than one person sucks ... 
Is never gonna get that damn < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > folder done by tomorrow . 
I just ate like , 9 < PROPFIRST > & Oscars breadsticks . Still not full . 
I am SO learning Russian when I start high school . Somehow ... 
Why do I have 3 people asking for me to draw them something in the same day ? 
So I go in to present my Culture Points projet for Rodak , and she makes me feel like a kicked puppy for leaving it till the last minute and not presenting for the class . I mean really , I was afraid I was going to start bawling right then and there . 
Why does nobody ever know what Prussia is ? 
... am I the only one that watched the State of the Union address ? 
I'm so happy and hyper that I WANT to go to school . Wtf is wrong with me . 
Got 3 wrong on the History becnhmark , got 88% . And I know everything I got wrong probably pertained to stuff we learned at the beginning of the year XD 
Contact lenses were made by a Czech chemist . So proud of my heritage ! 
Got purple contacts at the mall , AND I met a bunch of anime freaks like myself that are into all the same stuff as me and are going to the same conventions as me . Couldn't be happier :) 
My mother will scream at me to get downstairs when all she needs to do is say \ribs \"" 
Just realized that I have no idea what high school I'm going to be in next year . Whoa . 
Well apparently I fail at the unit on the Revolutionary War . Oddly enough , it was my favorite unit .... 
Apparently Russian children get birthday pies instead of birthday cakes . 
Eating Girl Scout cookies while watching football , rattling off to my parents about which other states I want to visit sometime in my life . I feel so American . 
There's going to be an immense amount of epic boredm until April ... 
My dog always tries to eat my history book , but she never goes after my math book . She must hate me . 
Everyone's spazzing over the Grammy's and I'm just trying to keep my History book intact XD 
Why does nobody know where Nantucket is ? 
Red < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > cakes are delicious , man . 
Why do people my age not care about politics ? 
I got a new sketchbook ! No more people stealing my sketchbook and looking at my trillions of drawings ( and me not getting it back for 2 classes) ! 
Mrs. Ploski's class effectively wasted an hour of my life . 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments . 
Gonna go draw myself . I seriously need a new profile picture and I am NOT photogenic . 
Finally got a new profile picture . And it's not even an actual photo . 
Drinking Russian Caravan tea . I feel accomplished . 
Heaven : The cook is French The officer is British The engineer is < PROPMALE > The banker is Swiss And the lover is Italian Hell : The cook is British The officer is < PROPMALE > The engineer is French The lover is Swiss And the banker is Italian 
Downloading Photoshop CS3 :D 
Since when does wearing a Union < PROPFIRST > mean that you're British ? 
I just made more cupcakes , anyone want any ? I have 20 . 
Ahhhh I love politics ! 
IM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP 
My dog was acting really strange and then my dad took her to the dog hospitol 4 hours ago . She just got home , it was a toxin , they gave her medicine and I'm not going to have to deal with my dog dying like I was afraid of ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day is probably the most depressing time of the year for me . Joy . 
Pistachios and cupcakes just became my breakfast . 
The cake is a lie ~ 
I think I just got re-obsessed with pokemon , seeing as how I found my Japanese SoulSilver . YES . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > = awesome . 
I'm gonna be in a photoshoot ~ 
Grounded for 3 weeks , yet I don't think my mom's ever actually effectively grounded me for more than 24 hours . 
I'm going to attempt to read Tolstoy's \War and Peace\ " . Anyone think I'm insane ? " 
I've listened to a song on repeat 279 times . 
Went to the bookstore to get War and Peace , and my mom says no . It took 10 minutes to make a compromise , so now at least I'm reading < PROPFEMALE > Karenina . 
I can't wait until Wednesday ... 
Hit a mental < PROPMALE > block made of < PROPFEMALE > ; I can see everything I want to draw , but it is completely impossible for me to draw it no matter how hard I try . I seriously just want to give up on drawing sometimes ... 
Is utterly exhausted from the draining , day-long activity that is nothing . 
I had a nightmare about a freaking lawn chair . I BLAME YOU , < PROPMALE > . 
Wigs are actually much easier to cut than one would assume . 
When it was pouring rain outside , the logical thing for me to do was * obviously * to go walk the dog in a short < PROPFIRST > skirt and a tank top . 
Watching the men's figure skating exhibitions just proves my Plushenko-complex . 
I'm actually excited for English homework . 
I over-analyze my feelings too much ... 
I am never making bets with people ever again . 
I have an orchestra Festival thing at 3 , which wouldn't be as much of a problem if I weren't playing on the outside row facing the judges . Ahh I hate being nervous . 
Someone's called me like , 5 times but I don't know the number D: 
I got a new phone and it's pink and girly and totally not me but I love it anyways and it's name is Feliks . 
Haha going to < PROPFIRST > Nuys ... AS < PROPFEMALE > >:D 
I already have the minimum amount of words typed for my short story for English and I'm barely into the rising action . 
Obamacare passed . Let the lawsuits begin . 
I made my decision . I'm going to CHS :) 
Making costumes is fun :) 
My family's having Mexican food for dinner . Wtf . 
Got graduation dresses :) 
Why do people have problems minding their own buisiness 
School seems to be more stressful after 5th period . 
Today is the epitome of utter confusion . 
WILL MY MOTHER EVER LEAVE ME ALONE FOR 10 MINUTESSSS 
I think it may have just hit me how much work i need to do over the weekend . Ugh . 
Chocolate !!!!!!!!!!!!!! * hyperventilates * 
Watching cousin play COD upstairs , and the house started moving . Earthquake wtf 
I always get artistic inspiration at the most inconvenient times ... 
I can't wait for the weekend :D 
The history book is not my bible . 
I'm thinking about a college in Michigan and I haven't even started high school yet . 
The results of my only two real hobbies are going to hotels dressed in weird costumes to show off , < PROPFEMALE > out with friends , and buy things . 
Three Days Grace , Japanese stuff , < PROPFIRST > Lambert , < PROPMALE > stuff , Spongebob , more Japanese stuff , Russian stuff , Iron Maiden ... Yeah , this is my iPod . 
My weekend will be spent at a hotel barely more than 30 minutes away dressed in costumes with my friends spending over $100 on Japanese things . 
So incredibly bored ... 
I'm going to use my week off to attempt to sew a costume XD 
I go to dance class in full anime costume , and get blank stares from the small children . I love my hobbies . 
I don't think my week could get any better :D 
Will someone be my sunflower ~ 
I'm too shy for my own good ... 
Run , run , run away Lost , lost , lost my mind Want you to stay Want you to be my prize 
And I thought I couldn't get more stressed out DX 
I think I'm the only person who's excited for school tomorrow . 
Can someone stab me ? Please ? 
I feel like I have to talk really slowly for my mom to understand how teenagers in the 21st Century work . 
I just got the Final Jeopardy quesiton right because of anime . The category was World War II . 
Apparently I have an accent when I ask question . 
I'M NOT BIPOLAR 
When you're a little kid , your parents want you to leave them alone and you want to bother them . When you're a teenager , you want your parents to leave you alone and they want to bother you . 
Rodak told me she loved my short story and the illustrations and I need to publish it . Am I in some alternate universe or something ? 
I'M NOT GIVING YOU BACK YOUR ARMENIANS , TURKEY 
I just typed a good 1000 words for a story as an email draft on my iPod , and my iPod closed the mail app on me . Without saving . UGH . 
We have to take a mental health test ? Dammit . I'm never gonna pass . 
I got 7 random people at the supermarket telling me that they love me hat . 
I want to dye some red streaks in my hair . If only my mom would let me >_> 
My dad is mad at me because I told him I prefer cows over the ocean . 
The bus rides were better than Disneyland itself . 
What if you feel it would be so much better if you stopped being friends with someone to go off by yourself , but you don't have anywhere to go ? 
Woo-hoo I finished my 8th grade tile thing . And it's not that complicated , I swear ! 
Apparently one person is a lot . 
I have a lot of spazzing people talking to me right now . 
OH MY GAWD VIDEOS JUST ARGH 
Today , May 1st , it is National Love Day in the Czech Republic , where couples flock to a statue of a poet and kiss . I feel weird that I'm 50% Czech . 
Reading . It made me depressed . 
OH YES , PHOTOSHOOTS IN COSPLAY ARE FUN 
I'm normal ! Perfectly normal , I say ! 
I can still taste the food coloring in my mouth . 
Scaring little children in costume is a very tiring job . 
Asking myself philosophical questions pertaining to the meaning of life makes me extremely depressed and yet I do it anyway . 
Why do I have guys hitting on me a lot in the past month ? 
\Hooker ! \ " \ " Patrick !! \ " \ " DIE !!! \"" 
Woo I lost my iPod . And now I'm informed that I was going to get a new one anyways >> 
SOCIAL STUDIES TESTING TOMORROW YAY 
Soooooooooo confused ... 
Nervousness for tomorrow 
Just got back from my < PROPFEMALE > dance recital that went sooooo well and it was so much fun :) Tomorrow I get to dye streaks in my hair . I dare someone to make my weekend better ^^ 
I have officially put red streaks in my hair . Now all I need to do is dry it . 
Awesome recital , red streaks , new iPod , and my weekend is fantastically perfect . 
Hope is a wonderful thing to do when everything that happens is out of your control . 
My . Mom . Makes . No . Sense . 
I've been avoided and ignored by a lot of people this past week . 
My mom doesn't trust me with anything anymore . Because I have a B in 2 classes . 
Might see Iron Man 2 with a bunch of guys :D 
My mom grounded me this weekend . I still don't know why . 
Ungrounded . That was fast . 
OHMYGODFUNIMATIONDECIDEDTOUSEACCENTSINTHEHETALIADUB .

all of the TV shows are ending this week and they all leave me with massive cliffhangers tht I have to wait the entire summer to see the next episode . grr . 
Flirting at random guys while waiting for food from the Taco < PROPFEMALE > drive-through . Lol what has become of me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > dancing for the talent show ... 
I'm in the best mood I've been in in months . 
Whenever I write poetry , it always turns out bloody , depressing , or angry . 
Prussia -- home of the pokemon masters . 
Just realized my birthday's in under a month . Whoa . 
I think Mr. Moreno thinks there's something wrong with my brain . 
Urgh , nausea . 
I have so much clothes that I specifically need to buy and it's all guy stuff . 
CHURROSSSSS . 
And now we have people stalking < PROPFEMALE > Palin . 
Stupid facebook not letting me be engaged . 
I feel Greek today . 
Apparently if I get hit on the head I can get a foreign accent . SOMEONE HIT ME .

It is so much fun to wear my wig through a McDonalds drive-thru

I decided that when the red streaks in my hair fade some more I'm going to dye the tips of my hair black . 
Dyed my hair :D 
Oh I could throw you in a lake , feed you poisoned birthday cake , I won't deny i'm gonna miss you when you're gone ~ oh I could bury you alive , but you might crawl out with a knife and kill me when I'm sleeping , that's why ~ I can't decide whether you should live or die ~ 
Have to wait for my laptop to be delivered to me until thursday :( 
I OFFICIALLY OWN A PAIR OF TEXAS

EVIL PLASTIC CONFETTI STARS OF DEATH 
Trying to fathom the unfathomable makes me depressed . This is what happens to me when I'm procrastinating writing fanfiction XD 
\The United States of Europe\ " \ 
Why doesn't asprin work when you want it to . 
I'm always the awkward single one amongst my friends that are in relationships . Aaaaaaas usual . 
Soviet propaganda posters make me laugh more than I laugh at every comedian I've ever seen in my life . 
Meh ... I feel kinda lonely . 
CHECK IT OUT , YO ! 
Dude , Russia's voice actor can SING . 
I HATE YOU ITUNES .

HOUSE IS BACK ON TOMORROWWWWWWWW 
I'm gonna love my lunch for tomorrow : Homemade chocolate chip cookies , Moroccan lamb chunks , and a sunflower peanut butter sandwich . I love cooking . 
When I'm on college , I'll be known as \that one girl who can cook really well and has a bunch of people mooching food off of her every day \"." 
Dammit . I won't get the replacement for my broken phone until Monday or Tuesday . Ughhhh . 
I don't think I've been this happy since I was four years old . 
Hey peoples ! Give me your phone < PROPFIRST > for my phone that's pretty much empty ! I lost all my contacts D: 
When everything is going wrong for me , everyone else is perfectly happy . Once I'm finally happy , everyone and everything else starts falling apart . Why can't I just have one day where I can be completely happy without that part of my head that knows I'm supposed to be helping with everyone else's problems . 
* runs in circles * Gah , I feel so happy !!! 
Go to hell , headache . 
The ability to empathize with people no matter the situation is both an amazing gift and a stressful pain . 
Buying four , possibly five wigs at once right about now . 
Can't wait for Sunday ~~~ 
Ahaha I might be going to a flag store tomorrow . 
My wigs are gonna come today and I'm going to a flag store around noon ~ 
I got a small Russian flag , small Hungarian flag , and huge American flag ( complete with flagpole and everything ) but I won't get my huge Hungarian flag until Tuesday or so D: And it turns out I probably won't get my wigs until Monday * sighs * Oh well :/ 
Even though I didn't go to homecoming , I still had an awesome day yesterday ! 
And at the end of the day , I'm bored out of my mind . 
Two hours and a couple I inches of synthetic fibers later and I have an awesome new wig . 
Now I've heard everything . If you're over the age of 12 and in a Halloween costume trick-or-treating in Belleville , Illinois , you can get ticketed . What the hell . 
Halloween on Sunday , NaNoWriMo on Monday , and midterms on Tuesday ... So many important things going on ! 
I GET TO SEE MY IGGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 
Go Republicans ~
