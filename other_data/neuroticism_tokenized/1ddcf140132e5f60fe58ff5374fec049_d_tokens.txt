U know what I like about the airforce , you cant take your rank off your uniform and pretend not to be airforce ! You represent the united states military any time you wear your uniform and not just when you feel like it ! Yes I'm talking to you navy I know who you are even when you don't wear your rank and ribbons and your a disgrace when you don't wear your uniform correctly !
