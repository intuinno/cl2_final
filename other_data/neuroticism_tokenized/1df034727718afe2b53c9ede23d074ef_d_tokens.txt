3 men go to a motel ; rooms are $30 . Each man paid $10 . Later the desk clerk realized the room was only $25 , so he sent the bellboy to their room with $5 . The bellboy couldn't figure out how to split $5 between 3 men , so he gave each man $1 and kept the other $2 . This meant that each man paid $9 , which is a total of $27 . Add the $2 that the bellboy kept brings the total to $29 . Where is the other dollar ?
