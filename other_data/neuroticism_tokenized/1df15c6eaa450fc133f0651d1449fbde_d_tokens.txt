The road to success is not straight . There is a curb called Failure , a loop called Confusion ; speed bumps called Friends ; red lights called Enemies ; caution lights called Family . You will have flats called jobs . But , if you have a spare called Determination ; an engine called Perseverance ; insurance called Faith ; you will make it to a place called Success ?
