seriously has 13 days , starting now , to have all of her things sorted , packed into her car , and be ready to move across the country , completely broke , no less . all of your good vibes , well wishes , prayers , handouts , ect . are not only seriously needed , but 
is touched that so many of you want me to visit before i leave , but seriously only has 11.5 days to move out of her apt . and probably only a day and a half off before then . so come see me , instead . august 8th , bonfire . byob , cause i'm f'ing broke . or , any

finally moved out of the apartment today and can't wait to be < PROPMALE > mountain high again ... to hear god's casual reply in the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake ... <3

desperately needs some highway 37 . could someone send me some ? 
wonders if you can teach a grown up dog critical thinking skills . or appropriateness . ooh , ooh , or maybe just to be grown up . 
has just been hit hard by the realization that she will likely not experience anything like the indiana fall that she knows and loves so dearly . * sigh * 
would kill for a little bit of romance . at least , i'd throw rocks at people .

thinks that if you say you're going to do something , going back on it later makes you a liar , whether the lie was intentional or not . doing this consistently makes you untrustworthy . being untrustworthy makes you not someone i can be friends with . 
is headed towards colorado , in about 10 minutes , and should be home in about 3 days !!! yay !!! keep me in your thoughts and prayers , this might be a boooring trip ! 
is in the real mountains :) . all of you can stop praying about my boring trip now . i have had break trouble , transmission trouble , have been stuck in the snow twice in the mountains , and have driven in snow/storms since leaving california . i should be back to indiana in a couple of days ! :) 
dear family , when you think of me while christmas shopping , think of super awesome warm socks , snow survival kits for my car , insulated gloves , and so forth . when did i become a grown-up , you ask ? who knows . 
is lovin ' some soulful way out sounds ... thanks , < PROPMALE > :) 
didn't know she'd be this heartbroken . of course , she also never imagined that the next time she saw you , you wouldn't actually be there . 
is working on changing the facts . 
is the girl with the messy mind , it's hard to find time to clear it .... 
has been kind of a jerk lately , and she's sorry . 
is home , and has never in her life been so happy to be in indiana . :) 
is back ! but ... i probably won't call you any time soon , because my phone is a piece of crap . you can still call me and leave messages , or send me something here if you want to see me ... 
misses you and needs to see you , stat . 
doesn't have to settle for any job , person , or situation in general that does not serve a purpose in her life , or that does not realize what an amazing thing they have here . here's hoping i stick to that tomorrow when i find out whether i'm getting a pay cut . 
:) 
is ... smiling still . :) 
can not tell you how freaking good it feels to finally wake up , check out her surroundings , and be completely happy about them . 
is really quite happy . 
loves < PROPFEMALE > guts . 
just realized what time it is ... ouch .

is ... hopeful , again . :) and back to work ! 
can honestly say she has never been more grateful for her life , her family , and her friends . this morning she is awed and amazed and thankful for every little moment , every little stress that i took for granted , or wanted to get rid of . thank you all so much for the love you give me , and for everyone who ever told me to \wake up \"." 
thinks it surely looks like rain ...

has no pure and honest wish she can send out right now , except for your soul to be peaceful ... the world needs your soul-shine . 
has the prayer flags for your car in her car . 
has no idea who has sent her the 20 text messages she's heard her phone recieve today . i am sure i want you to quit texting me , because my screen is broken , and though i can't see your messages , i still have to pay for them . thanks ! 
misses you ...

the funk just never gets old .... 
is so grateful right now , for everything . 
as you ramble through your sorrow , seems like everything's come out wrong .... you know i've been called a dreamer , dreams that never come true ... tell you what we're gonna do . we'll take a < PROPFEMALE > and see what we can do about it . we'll take a simple c and g and feel brand new about it . :)

Sometimes , when we are discouraged by a difficult situation , anger does seem helpful , appearing to bring more energy , confidence and determination . And while it is true anger brings more energy , it eclipses the best part of our brain : it's rationality . So the energy of anger is almost always unreliable . It can cause an immense amount of destructive , unfortunate behavior . -HH Dalai Lama 
the guideline is this : when in doubt , don't be douchy . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
oooohh , to be < PROPMALE > caselot ! 
why drink the water from my hand , contagious as you think i am ? just tilt my sun towards your domain , your cup runneth over again ... 
I feel my mind crack , and in the fissures , I see the bottomless arogance of my pressuppositions . ... here I find myself in a more powerful reality that I do not understand at all and that , in my arrogance , I did not even suspect existed . - < PROPFIRST > narby 
hooray for fall , great friends , a wonderful family , being in school to graduate this time , < PROPMALE > & colbert shows , a boyfriend I actually want to keep , snuggly dogs , strong drinks , scented candles , sleepingbags , new music , good books , and cheesy pasta . life is pretty freaking good .

The secret < PROPMALE > of inviting happiness , the miraculous medicine of all diseases : Just for today , do not be angry . Do not worry and be filled with gratitude . Devote yourself to your work and be kind to people . Every morning and evening join your hands in prayer , pray these words to your he < PROPMALE > and chant these words with your mouth . 
for every group of people there are others that are ' outsiders ' . may we all begin to live in a love so big that we can not find the boundaries to place others outside . 
someone stole my phone from my car at aldi's yesterday . pray that they have a burst of conscience and feel guilty and return it to the store . 
learning ... to dance inside the sacred , to harness the power of the universe , to consciously create each moment , to live inside of love , and to trust the voice inside her . 
doesn't have to be strong , just conductive . 
would like to thank her friends for loving her so much .

Your feelings are a part of you . Your own reality . If you are ashamed of them , and hide them , you're letting society destroy your reality . You should stand up for your right to feel your pain . - < PROPMALE > Morrison\

anyone looking for a new dog ? i've come across a beautiful , super obedient , extremely sweet 2 year old girl dog in desperate need of a home . probably about 40-45 lbs . she is living in her cage right now , pretty much all of the time , as the people caring for her have 4 cats as well . i would keep her myself , but am not able to . 
there are things you can replace , and those that you can not . the time has come to weigh those things . ( this space is getting hot ) ... can't talk to you without talking to me , we're guilty of the same old thing : talking a lot about less and less and forgetting the love we bring ... 
best part of the super bowl , by far : watching usher dance in sync to papadosio at half time . 
in our world a child dies every five seconds from hunger related causes . another 10 million a day die from treatable medical condidtions because of a lack of healthcare . at least five children a day die from abuse in < PROPFEMALE > alone . seems to me that our concern should fall with the babies already here , and with providing birth control in our health care systems , way before we discuss the \morality\ " of abortion laws .

Realize that true happiness lies within you . Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside . Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting , but only in giving . Reach out . Share . Smile . Hug .

in 1996 , 22.5% of kids who had used marijuana before the age of 15 dropped out of high school before graduation . in the same year the national on time grad rate was only 66.4% . when you see the two statistics together , it looks like the kids who smoked pot actually had * less * of a < PROPMALE > of dropping out of school than those who didn't ... makes you think .
