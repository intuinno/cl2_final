Read , every day , something no one else is reading . Think , every day , something no one else is thinking . Do , every day , something no one else would be silly enough to do . It is bad for the mind to be always part of unanimity . - < PROPFIRST > Morley 
I miss the old days ...

And it's true , that I love you And it's true , you're the only one And I do , I adore you And it's true , girl You make me feel ali-i-i-ive 
My circumstances do not make me what I am , they reveal who I have chosen to be . 
Imperfection is beauty , madness is genius , and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring . 
There's not much that I can say , but there sure is something I've got to prove to you , I told you that i tried , and you said that I lied , like I had something to sell 
And all I know is that it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that forever feels like home ... 
Laziness is nothing more than a habit of resting before you get tired .

Chaos is , in fact , just an illusion created by your inability to perceive the order in which things truly are . 
I ain't in no hurry , you go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch . Fill their heads with rumours of impending doom . It must be true .

just realized something horrible ... 
Fear\ 
And panic in the air \ 
I want to be free \ 
From desolation and despair \ 
And I feel \ 
Like everything I saw Is being swept away \ 
When I refuse to let you go 
Life\ 
Will flash before my eyes \ 
So scattered and lost\ 
I want to touch the other side \ 
And no one \ 
Thinks they are to blame \ 
Why can't we see \ 
That when we bleed we bleed the same ? 
I have returned . And though all the plans didn't quite go through I believe the mission was a complete success . 
WOOOOO HOOOOOOO !

Far away\ 
This ship is taking me far away\ 
Far away from the memories\ 
Of the people who care if I live or die\

Starlight\ 
I will be chasing the starlight\ 
Until the end of my life\ 
I don't know if it's worth it anymore 
Oh Maclin . Great party . But no whiskey . We go home . 
I was gratified to be able to answer promptly . I said I don't know . - < PROPFIRST > Twain 
Once I < PROPFEMALE > above the noise and confusion\ 
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion\ 
I was soaring ever higher\ 
But I flew too high\ 
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man\ 
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man\ 
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming\ 
I can hear them say\ 
< PROPFEMALE > on my wayward son\ 
There'll be peace when you are done\ 
Lay your weary head to rest\ 
Don't you cry no more 
If I could see the future and how this plays out\ 
I bet it's better than where we are now\ 
But after going through this , it's easier to see the reason why\ 
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow \ 
I can't believe that I stayed ' til today\ 
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow\ 
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise 
There is no spoon . 
just finished watching all three X-Men movies ... now I'm tired 
Lets paint the picture of the perfect place\ 
They got it better than what anyone's told ya\ 
They'll be the < PROPMALE > of hearts\ 
And you're the < PROPFEMALE > of spades\ 
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers\ 
I know we got it good\ 
But they got it made\ 
And their grass is getting greener each day\ 
I know things are loo < PROPMALE > up\ 
But soon you'll take us down\ 
Before anybodies knowin our name 
You can’t sleep , you can’t eat\ 
there’s no doubt , you’re in deep\ 
your throat is tight , you can’t breathe\ 
another kiss is all you need\ 
Whoa , you like to think that you’re immune to the stuff , oh yeah\ 
it’s closer to the truth to say you can’t get enough , \ 
you know you’re gonna have to face it , you’re addicted to love 
is takin songs from the < PROPFIRST > Stevens Greatest Hits Vinyl Record and is gonna put them on a CD ... I love technology 
I used to rule the world\ 
Seas would rise when I gave the word\ 
Now in the morning I sleep alone\ 
Sweep the streets I used to own\ 
I used to roll the dice\ 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes\ 
Listen as the crowd would sing\ 
\Now the old < PROPMALE > is dead ! Long live the < PROPMALE >!\" \ 
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains\ 
I knew I wouldn't forget you , and so I went \ 
and let you blow my mind\ 
Your sweet < PROPFEMALE > beam , the smell of you in \ 
every single dream I dream\ 
I knew when we collided , you're the one I\ 
have decided who's one of my kind 
I can still remember \ 
The words and what they meant \ 
As we etched them with our fingers \ 
In years of wet cement \ 
The days blurred into each other \ 
Though everything seemed clear \ 
We cruised along at half speed \ 
But then we shifted gears 
They will not force us , \ 
They will stop degrading us , \ 
They will not control us , \ 
And we will ? be victorious ! 
How many times can I break til I shatter ? \ 
Over the line , can't define what I'm after\ 
I always turn the car around\ 
Give me a break ; let me make my own pattern\ 
All that it takes is some time\ 
But I'm shattered\ 
I always turn the car around 
Hey , come on try a little \ 
Nothing is forever \ 
There's got to be something better than \ 
In the middle \ 
But me & < PROPFEMALE > \ 
We put it all together \ 
We can drive it home \ 
With one headlight 
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing\ 
Just prayin ' to a god that I don't believe in\ 
Cos I got time while she got freedom\ 
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even\ 
Her best days will be some of my worst\ 
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first\ 
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping\ 
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven ... even ... no 
I'll miss you grandpa ... you were great to have around 
You're getting closer \ 
To pushing me off of life's little edge \ 
' Cause I'm a loser \ 
And sooner or later you know I'll be dead \ 
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall \ 
' Cause I'm a loser , I'm a loser , yeah . 
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding\ 
So you can see your feelings inside yourself\ 
And wonder through my heart\ 
Letting you see through me now only consumes me\ 
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart 
I'm sorry I'm bad , I'm sorry you're blue \ 
I'm sorry about all things I said to you \ 
And I know , I cant take it back . \ 
I love how you kiss , I love all your sounds \ 
And baby , the way you make my world go round \ 
And I just wanted to say , I'm sorry 
I think i've walked too close to love\ 
And now i'm falling in\ 
Theres so many things this weary soul can't take \ 
Maybe you just caught me by surprise\ 
The first time that i looked into your eyes 
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation\ 
Half of my heart takes time\ 
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you\ 
That I can't keep loving you\ 
Oh , with half of my heart 
I want to run through the halls of my high school \ 
I want to scream at the top of my lungs \ 
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world \ 
just a lie you've got to rise above 
just a lie you've got to rise above\ 
I just can't wait til my 10 year reunion\ 
I'm gonna bust down the double doors\ 
and when I stand on these tables before you\ 
you will know what all this time was for 
Cause you're halfway gone and I'm on way\ 
And I'm feeling , feelin feelin this way\ 
Cause I'm halfway in but don't take too long\ 
Cause I'm halfway gone , I'm halfway gone 
Does she walk ? Does she talk ? \ 
Does she come complete ? \ 
My homeroom homeroom angel\ 
Always pulled me from my seat\ 
She was pure like snowflakes\ 
No one could ever stain\ 
The memory of my angel\ 
Could never cause me pain\ 
Years go by I'm lookin ' through a girly magazine\ 
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between\ 
My blood runs cold\ 
My memory has just been sold\ 
My angel is the centerfold\ 
Angel is the centerfold 
I'm puttin ' on my shades to cover up my eyes\ 
I'm jumpin ' in my ride , I'm headin ' out tonight\ 
I'm solo , I'm ridin ' solo\ 
I'm ridin ' solo , I'm ridin ' solo , solo\ 
I'm feelin ' like a < PROPFEMALE > , you can't stop my shine\ 
I'm lovin ' cloud nine , my head's in the sky\ 
I'm ridin ' solo , I'm ridin ' solo , solo 
I tried so very hard not to lose it \ 
I came up with a million excuses\ 
I thought , I thought of every possibility\ 
And I know someday that it'll all turn out\ 
You'll make me work , so we can work to work it out\ 
And I promise you , kid , that I give so much more than I get\ 
I just haven't met you yet 
I wear my sunglasses at night\ 
So I can , so I can\ 
Forget my name while you collect your claim\ 
And I wear my sunglasses at night\ 
See the light that's right before my eyes 
I'm not afraid ( I'm not afraid)\ 
To take a stand ( to take a stand)\ 
Everybody ( everybody)\ 
Come take my hand ( come take my hand)\ 
We'll walk this road together , through the storm\ 
Whatever weather , cold or warm\ 
Just lettin you know that , you're not alone\ 
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road ( same road ) 
Do you remember when we first met ? \ 
I sure do\ 
It was some time\ 
In early September\ 
You were lazy about it\ 
You made me wait around\ 
I was so crazy about you\ 
I didn't mind\ 
So I was late for class\ 
I locked my bike to yours\ 
It wasn't hard to find\ 
You painted flowers on\ 
Guess that I was afraid\ 
That if you rode away\ 
You might not roll back\ 
My direction real soon\ 
Well I was crazy about you then 
And I don't want the world to see me \ 
Cause I don't think that they'd understand \ 
When everything's made to be broken \ 
I just want you to know who I am \ 
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming \ 
Or the moment of truth in your lies \ 
When everything seems like the movies \ 
Yeah you bleed just to know your alive 
I don't wanna close my eyes \ 
I don't wanna fall asleep\ 
' Cause I'd miss you , babe\ 
And I don't wanna miss a thing\ 
' Cause even when I dream of you\ 
The sweetest dream will never do\ 
I'd still miss you , babe\ 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
I wish you knew , \ 
If only you could see\ 
That it's too late\ 
I'm no longer me . 
If I could write you a song , \ 
and make you fall in love , \ 
I would already have you up under my arm . \ 
I used to pull all my tricks , \ 
I hope that you like this . \ 
but you probably won't , \ 
you think you're cooler than me . \ 
you got designer shades , \ 
just to hide your face and \ 
you wear them around like \ 
you're cooler than me . \ 
and you never say hey , \ 
or remember my name . \ 
its probably cuz , \ 
you think you're cooler than me . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Safarik : I think I'm gonna work on my six pack\ 
Me : You might wanna open the fridge first . 
Even though I know\ 
I don’t want to know\ 
Yeah I guess I know\ 
I just hate how it sounds\ 
If I traded it all\ 
If I gave it all away for one thing\ 
Just for one thing\ 
If I sorted it out\ 
If I knew all about this one thing\ 
Wouldn’t that be something

I've never had to knock on wood\ 
But I know someone who has\ 
Which makes me wonder if I could\ 
It makes me wonder if\ 
And I'm glad I haven't yet\ 
Because I'm sure it isn't good\ 
That's the impression that I get 
With a thousand lies\ 
And a good disguise\ 
Hit em right between the eyes\ 
When u walk away\ 
Nothing more to say\ 
See the lightning in your eyes\ 
See em running for their lives\ 
Slowly out of line\ 
And drifting closer in ur sights\ 
So play it out I’m wide awake\ 
It’s a scene about me\ 
There’s something in ur way\ 
And now someone is gonna pay\ 
And if u can’t get wat u want\ 
Well it’s all because of me

Come by it honestly I swear\ 
Thought you saw me wink , no\ 
I've been on the brink , so\ 
Tell me what you want to hear\ 
Something that were like those years\ 
Sick of all the insincere\ 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away\ 
This time , don't need another perfect lie\ 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line\ 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
GO BIG RED !!! 
It's so damn easy , when your feelings are such\ 
To overprotect her , to love her too much\ 
And my mind goes back to a girl I left some years ago\ 
Who told me , \ 
Just Hold On Loosely , but don't let go\ 
If you cling too tight babe , you're gonna loose control\ 
Your baby needs someone to believe in\ 
And a whole lot of space to breathe in

A great love is a lot like a good memory . When it's there , and you know it's there , but it's just out of your reach , it can be all that you think about . You can focus on it and try to force it , but the more you do , the more you seem to push it away . But , if you're patient , and you hold still , well maybe , just maybe it'll come to you . -Church

I have reached the conclusion that there are people in life that enjoy your company and those that do not . The former would do anything for you and forgive you when you screw up . The latter will use who you are for their own ends and then as soon as there is the slightest problem drop you and run . For those of you that fall in the second category , sorry I've caused so much trouble for you .
