All I want to be is a shovely bubbly gobbly gook . 

\Am I a clone ? \ " \ " Are you hungry ? \"" 
Life is only a fleeting vision of what could have been . Live it to its highest potential , push the human mind to the edge , and never regret anything you do . 
I like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly . 
Kiss the one you love , with reckless abandonment . 
The damage I'm causing to my own mind doesn't even come close to the damage I'm causing to yours . 
I have the motivation of one thousand stones . 
wants to write another demented short story , but doesn't have any ideas formulated . 
Life is scarier than death . 
It is a wonderful thing to be free of all obligations . I am happy now . ^_^ 
Mind games give me a purpose to live . Depressing , but oh so fun ! 
I am the Jigsaw of the subconscious mind ... And I want to play a game . 
One step closer to three-four . 
I like to make myself believe that she's still around . 
If I could rearrange the alphabet , I'd put YOUR SISTER and I together . 
Everything that has a beginning has an end . It's how we handle these two events that determine how we will live the rest of our lives . 
This ends now . 
The things we are will to lose our lives to protect are the things that will destroy us . 
No one is going to fall . People will stumble , but no one will fall . Everything will go on as it always would : No one will be looking back . 
My hobby : Changing my Facebook relationship status to ' It's complicated , ' only to make people wonder who's involved . 
Why is it that every time something good happens , I wake up ? 
Life is like a box of chocolates . Leave it in the sun too long and all you're left with is a mess . 
Hooray for a 13 hour day ! Band is fun ! 
Reactions make it all worthwhile . Oh , but the immediate effect is good , too . 
Quantum physics question : If waves of probability are collapsed by observation , then what about the places that no one knows exist ? 
You know it's bad when impossibilities plague your subconcious . 
The possibilities are endless ... And that's what scares me . 
gives up . I'm going back to parkour . 
I have five fingers on each hand for every mistake that I've made . 
Psychological mazes are a bitch . But it's all ending soon ... ^_^ 
GAME OVER . I WIN . HA . 
loves his subwoofer . Bass is amazing . ^_^ 
SOMEBODY SET US UP THE BOMB . 
Do everything , regret nothing . 
Brownies are FUCKING DELICIOUS . 
Why do people choose to live life on the sidelines ? It's pretty hard to win that way . 
199 words , 2 hours . I am terribly distracted ... Good thing I'm only doing this for fun , and not for a grade . 
is enjoying life . ^_^ 
The day is over , but we have only just begun ... ^_^ 
I'll be out of my mind . / And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon . 
Where'd you go ? :P 
Buildings are crumbling , minds are breaking , people are dying . The entire planet is ending ... but I'm just getting started . 
And when all the ghouls and wastlanders of megaton look up and shout \Save us ! \ " I'll look down and whisper ... \ " Tunnel snakes rule . \"" 
Left at 7am , and I just got home . Today made me happy . ^_^ And ' A Bugs Life ' is a great movie . ** wink ** 
Pumpkin Eggnog is NOT eggnog . -_- 
If I get emancipated , does that mean I can adopt you ? 
1103 . HELL . YES . Time for round two . 
What am I looking for ...? 
still loves his subwoofer . Bass is amazing . ^_^ 
I feel like a hot air balloon . xD 
Today is the day before two days after yesterday , yesterday was the day three days before the day after tomorrow , and tomorrow is Tuesday . 
I woke up with a piercing headache , the familiar taste of strawberry in my mouth , and someone else's blood staining my middle finger . What the hell did I do last night ? 
Ahhh ...... Life . ^_^ 
All I see is people burning ... 
Working on second period final right now . It's pretty hard . I don't know if I'll pass . :P 
Skulls crush and hearts collapse under the weight of my ultimate dream . Are you strong enough to survive knowing me ? 
Was it worth it ? Hmm .... Definitely . ^_^ 
The world is inside out ? Really ? I KNEW something was wrong with those brownies ... 
Is it last Friday yet ? 
Yaay ! Time to remember how to ski ! xD 
wants to go sit by a black hole so he can live for 100,000 years . 
BURN THE WORLD !!! HAAAA HAA HAHAHAHAAA !!!!! 
Victim 3 is on the way ! :D 
Victim Three has shown its ugly face . You're welcome . :P 
is having a lot more fun with this than he should . 
Ahh .... Life is a wonderful thing . Don't you agree , Mr. Crack Dealer ? 
' Maxalysis : A Socialogical Look Into the Mind of a Jackass . ' Stay tuned ! ^_^ 
That that that is that that is not is not that that is that that is is not true is not true . 
It's somewhat difficult to stay optimistic while I watch the world crumble around me . 
Triumphant moments in < PROPMALE > Soopers . FANTASTIC . 
I've got a knack for this sort of thing . 
Sure could go for a solution right about now ... 
If we always want what we can't have , then what do we want when we can have anything ? 
has nothing that needs to be said , so he's just going to sit here and smile . ^_^ 
just did something horrible ... I got a haircut . 
\Do you have AIDS ? \ " \ " No . \ " \ " Me neither . That makes three of us ! \"" 
The past has no meaning . Live for today , look forward to tomorrow . 
It's not every day that you kick your section leader in the face . :P 
Humanity , by nature is pessimistic . As such , there will always be ' what ifs . ' There will always be doubt . Yet , without doubt , there cannot be certainty . If there is certainty , then everything we do will have a reason . Everything will have a meaning . With meaning behind our actions , we should never regret anything . If there is no regret behind our actions , then there is no doubt that we should have done them . 
Everything that has a beginning has an end ... I hope I'm just being paranoid ... 
I'm so lucky . ^_^ 
Everyone is filled with their own misconceptions of reality . I can't wait until people can see their lives for what they truly are . 
is wishing and waiting and for things to return to normal . Hopefully by Friday .. 
Only connect the dots if you're looking for a horrible picture . 
I love having three days of spring break to do whatever I want . Yaay percussion ! :P 
should not still be awake , seeing as State is tomorrow . Umm ... today . About eight hours until morning practice . ^_^ 
finds it funny that they got their highest score with him leading the Pit . :P 
Upcoming stories include ' Victim Four : The Librarian , ' ' Lifewatch , ' and ' Victim Five : The Agent . ' Stay tuned ! ^_^ 
The best of us can find happiness in misery . 
wonders what the world would be like if we were all DINOSAURS . 
I like my family . xD 
really didn't expect to like ' Perfume ' as much as he did . 
Well , this is craptastic . Hope the plan works out . If not , I have my lighter at the ready and my gasoline tank by my side . 
Within no time , Jean-Baptiste Grenouille had disappeared from the face of the earth . When they had finished , they felt a virginal glow of happiness . For the first time in their lives , they believed they had done something purely out of love . \ " , 201 0-0 4-26 23:26:27 " 
I love having every one of my actions misinterpreted as crimes . I have reasons for everything I do . Sensible , innocent reasons . 
misses his face . 
The past causes regret . The future brings anxiety . The only choice is to live life for the moment . 
Why is everything so green ...? 
As of today , it's been six months . Really ? Half a year ? It doesn't even feel like six weeks yet . ^_^ I love you , < PROPFEMALE > Patterson !

Why are civil wars called civil wars when they are the least civil of all wars ? 
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts . 
Living is great . I'm really gonna miss it in 80 years ... 
Woo !! 2nd place at I&E !! I am , statistically , the second best marimbist in the state . :P 
Kids : If you really want to piss off your parents , buy real estate in an imaginary place . 
My ACT score was OVER 9000 !!! 
I should work on my time travel essay , but this is all a tangent universe . Soon , some < PROPFEMALE > will pull me away from my computer , I'll have to find where this essay came from ( causing mass destruction and chaos in the process ) , and then I'll guide the then-finished essay back to the primary universe . I'll finish the essay today , about a month from now . 
Post here if you want a copy of my complete and intricate explanation of < PROPFIRST > Darko , along with an in-depth discussion of time travel .

High five to the first person to decode this . 
Two days every week isn't THAT bad . Could be worse ... oh wait . 
If you're living a lie , does that mean you're actually dead ? 
Went to bed at 2:45 this morning . Wasn't really tired . Woke up at 8 this morning . Wasn't really tired . Had a cup of coffee this morning . Really not tired . Why am I so not tired ? And why did I wake up so early ?? 
Sweet dreams are made of YOUR MOM . 
I love Facebook . \R U Smarter than Bieber ? Try to beat his IQ score ! \"" 
The date I start Victim Four will be based on the kind of response this status gets . 
Piano Hero isn't just a dream anymore . REAL GUITARS have made an appearance in the Guitar Hero genre . Introducing : Rock Band 3 . 
Quantum mechanical game design = Instant win . 
Forever and always . 
I'm not a jerk . I just like making sure stupid people know they're stupid . 
You know what , Einstein ? YOUR MOM = MC^2 . HA . 
likes < PROPFEMALE > Patterson . 
' < PROPFEMALE>'s Adventures in Wonderland ' is the strangest book ever published . It's weirder than the movies by quite a bit . 
wonders why the world is round instead of flat . It'd be awesome to see people fall off the face of the earth . ^_^ 
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive . 
Everyone needs to play at least ONE of these : 
Something is nothing and nothing is something and something could be anything and anything applies to EVERYTHING . 
Yaaay wisdom teeth removal tomorrow . -_- \ 
And maybe a fifth tooth . Fun fun fun ! 
Painkillers are a godsend . 
To everyone in a relationship : I don't care how cheesy this sounds , but be open with your feelings . You'll thank me later . 
HOLY CRAP I ATE FAST FOOD . After four painful days of a liquid diet , I can truly call myself an American again . Not that I'm proud of that , but solid food is good . ^_^ 
Well , it's been a good run , I guess . \ 
Everything that has a beginning has an end . It was true all along . \ 
I hope you can find happiness in someone else , then . :( 
If our relationship is crashing and burning , then why do I feel so cold ? 
All great men are secretly persistent idiots . I don't know if I'm a great idiot or just a persistent man ... 
is probably more hopeful than he should be ... 
I don't know when I should give up hope . I'm thinking Friday ... I can't < PROPFEMALE > on between hope and fear . I can't leave it all up to her forever . If there is no response by Friday , I move on in life . Alone . 
Back early . The trip was more taxing than expected on both of us . Still summitted the second tallest mountain in Colorado ... The view was incredible . Hiking 10 < PROPMALE > with a backpack is ... strenuous . I ache everywhere . Completely worth it . ^_^ 
Well THAT'S a load off my mind . Now to ... I dunno . Zone out or something . :P 
I'm in the process of creating a game here , by the name of ' Control . ' It's going to be a very psychological game in that it plays off of what the player thinks they know . I can take care of the game itself ( Although a good artist would be nice ) , but I need someone who can do the voice of an innocent little girl . Now taking applicants for artists and voices . 
Gravity is hard to implement into flash games ... I can't get the coding quite right . 
With the right tools and the right people , we can change the world . We can alter life as we see fit . We can recreate anything , everything . 
Two kinds of things can happen in life : The things that are too good to be real and the things that are too real to be good . 
Awesome night last night . Thanks to all who were involved , except for < PROPMALE > . :P \ 
T'was fun indeed ... < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ... Ranch ketchup ... xD 
If you take a step back , the image becomes clearer . If you keep stepping back , you see it as what it really was . I am me . I am no one else . There is no one like me . I am my own person , and I will keep being my own person . Live with it . 
wonders how the hell < PROPFIRST > got the gravity to work . And so simply , too . Still waiting for him to send me the code . 
It is impossible to take a quote to heart until you have already missed the opportunity to use it . 
My brain and my heart are at war , and I'm caught in the crossfire . 
When you look at me with your cinematic eyes / I want to play the part but I forget the lines . 
Finally got Flash Professional CS5 to run . And gravity is coming along . I have a prototype of it from < PROPFIRST > , but I want to see what I can improve by myself . Next up is graphics , map production , storyline ... Then finally voice acting . Voice acting won't happen for quite a while , so don't ask to do it just yet . 
You know that we are gonna be okay . / We'll stick together as we're trippin ' down the freeway . 
Doesn't time heal all wounds ? What if time is causing the wound ? What then ? The more we're apart , the more I want us back together . The more probable I think it is . I think my brain is lying to me , but I can't be sure ... 
To whom it may concern : Victim Four is currently in production . 
thinks it's all over . Or will he go back again ? Try again ? There's no mystery anymore . It's all hopeless . But what if ...? 
** snap ** Oops . \ 
The world is a funny place . Life is meant to be entertaining . Enjoy it . Let the games ... resume . :D 
Should I play the most dangerous game of ' poke the bear ' yet ? 
If you acknowledge its existence , it ceases to be . If you pretend it isn't there , it plagues your mind . If you knew what it was , it wouldn't be so important to you . If you've known all along , then it would be all you know . The first step is to figure out what it is . 
wonders what will take place during the two hours between rehearsal and < PROPFIRST>'s . He is slightly worried . :P 
I can't believe < PROPMALE > actually did it ... xD 
Something happened that made someone somewhere happy for some reason that someone didn't know , but someone didn't care because someone was happy and now everything is something without worry or concern and someone has nothing to think about or worry about or holding him back . Someone is free to do something that someone wants to , and someone couldn't be any happier about it . Someone , somewhere , is really truly free . 
loves how he's made out to be the bad guy . xD\ 
Is the search for truth really a criminal act ? All I wanted was an answer . Now that I have that ( finally ) , I'm happy . And stalking is following someone , tapping their phone , reading their emails , peering through their window ... NOT trying to figure out what's going on . Dictionaries are your friend . 
Keep your daughter's locked indoors , keep your guns loaded , and NEVER be out at night alone . < PROPMALE>'s out there , and you KNOW he's a sociopathic murderer . Or something like that . xD 
Why did she turn against me so violently ? Did my search for an answer destroy her personality ? ... Apparently . 
\What the f is this ? \ " ** Holds up a bowling ball**\ 
' The Big Lebowski ' is a great movie ... I love < PROPFIRST > . xD 
It's crazy how much and how quickly people can change . It's also kinda depressing . Oh well . 
needs awesome movies to download ( NOT The Hangover . I know someone will say it ) . Suggestions , anyone ? 
Humans are ignorant . They do want they want with little to no regard to the consequences . Sub-humans are worse . They know of the consequences , and don't care in the slightest . They use people for their own gain . Those who can see the difference between the two are better than both of them . 
What does it mean to be yourself ? Everyone acts differently around different people . Everyone changes . From our own perspective , we are always ourself , but we cannot trust ourselves with this . People say we change . People say we aren't the same . Is there a constant personality , buried somewhere inside us , that is truly ' us ? ' If so , can we be that person ? Can we truly be ourselves ? 
If you would date me , flirt with me or ask me out or something . \ 
If you love me , stay by my side , help me when I need it , and never leave me . \ 
If you're my friend , < PROPFEMALE > out with me . \ 
If you hate me , don't talk to me anymore . \ 
If you miss me , give me a call or something . \ 
If you're upset with me , then tell me . \ 
If you really need Facebook to help people express how they feel about you , then get a life . 
Let's see ... am I going to get my class ring back , or am I going to get the cops called on me ? Cause asking for one's belongings is DEFINITELY STALKING . 
Messer Fur Frau Muller is true music . So very strange , so very different , and so very AWESOME . 
2*2 = 5 , which equals a piece that would be AWESOME for a percussion ensemble to play . ^_^ 
I love you . Kiss me . Marry me . Stay out of my life . 
You are my best friend . Let's < PROPFEMALE > out more often . Don't be surprised when I stab you in the back . 
I've posted it before , but I'll post it again cause it's an awesome quote : \Worthless people only live to eat and drink . People of worth eat and drink only to live . \ " -Socrates " 
Okay , this has been going on for far too long . I'm finishing Victim Four by Tuesday night . It will be posted Tuesday night . People , hold me to this , cause apparently I can't . xD 
\There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world ; there is only the comparison of one state with another . Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss . It is necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to live ..... the sum of all human wisdom will be contained in these two words : Wait and Hope . \ " -Alexandre Dumas " 
Don't just recognize that there are two sides to every story , but be able to tell every story from both sides . 
Holy crap , my mind is in an AWESOME place right now . I feel naturally high . Like really , really , really .... weeeeeeee ..... 
You're aren't sunburnt until your skin starts turning purple . 
Down is up and up is down . The floor is the ceiling , the ceiling , the ground . Every smile is another frown ... Maybe I should write this into a full poem . Or maybe I should stop standing on my head . :P 
I will die for you , as long as I get to see you tomorrow . 
Human emotion is a questionable thing . It can give us power just as easily as it can take it away . It can lead us into the dark abyss or lead us to untold riches . If we follow emotion's path , it can transform our lives into perfect utopias ... or end them prematurely . 
Watch your step , because when you fall , I won't be there to pick you up anymore . Temporary happiness is only universal deceit . And yet , temporary happiness is the only happiness ... our lives are spent lying to ourselves . 
should really starting writing again ... I have the ideas , just not the motivation ... 
When I'm happy , I write about murder . When I'm sad , I write about suicides . Must all my stories end in death ? Must they all be strangely AWESOME ? Must I be so overly modest ? Must I get them published sooner or later ? Definitely . 
is concerned , confused , and acting rather spontaneously . Now let's go bomb Jamaica and hope we don't get caught . 
Three philosophical conversations . All at once . Hell . Yes . I'd < PROPMALE > in philosophy if a degree in it would give me a REAL job . 
Oh yeah . Did I mention she was a T-REX ?!? 
Doing what is necessary makes us into machines . Doing what we want makes us ourselves . There are times when we must be machines , just as there are times when we must be ourselves . The conflict of finding the right time for each is what makes us human . 
If you are going to do something that anyone considers important , then do it in person . 
Wow ... the bit of Victim Four that it shows EVERYONE sounds pretty bad to those unfamiliar with the series ... Oh well . It's here , it's murderous , it's The Messenger . 
Still counting the days I've been without you . Still counting the days that you've been gone . 
There comes a time when you aren't sure why you want something . You think about it , long and hard , and in the end , come up with a different reason every time . All you know is that you want it , and it really doesn't matter why . All that matters is that you don't want it for the wrong reason . 
It's all up to you , now . You know how I feel . You know what I want . You know the obstacles that need to be overcome . The choice is yours ; I've made mine . 
How is it that it takes an entire family to hold me in the past , but only one person to pull me towards the future ? 
Still counting the days I've been without you ... Day five . This damn song has been stuck in my head for FIVE FREAKING DAYS . I like it , but this is getting ridiculous . xD 
It isn't always someone else who changes . Sometimes , you just can't accept the fact that they stayed true to what they've said . Sometimes , you change . You convince yourself that they've been lying to you , and taking it out on them won't change you back . 
Sometimes , things just fall into place . There is no reason or cause for many of the things in life , but we know we like them . Sometimes , the completely unexpected is the exact thing we were expecting . 
It's crazy how many different views there are on the same reality . Or maybe there are multiple realities , each and every person living in their own world ... 
Social norms and flawed learning will be the downfall of us all . As a whole , the world could be operating much more efficiently . 
just got ALL the sheet music from Cave Story . WIN . 
is so incredibly happy . The epic saga of one relationship , from beginning to end , is finally CLOSED . Gone . Finished . I can move on , care-free . Now please stop talking crap about me , especially when you don't know half the situation . 
Living in the past will only ensure that you won't make it to the future . 
So I've updated my cIOS's , downloaded the latest . dol of CFG USB Loader , modified my GUI ( Thinking of creating my own soon ) , updated my Homebrew Channel , and played some < PROPMALE > of Persia . By now , I completely forgot what I set out to accomplish , but hey : Hacking the Wii is fun , any way you slice it . ^_^ 
Two dreamers in the same dream are two lovers in complete happiness . Two dreams in the same dreamer is a torment soul , torn apart by conflicting desires . 
should not be planning this . SHOULD . NOT . Be planning this . At all . 
is treading in some very dangerous waters . 
It was the taste of it , and this is how we wasted it . Maybe we'll get it back somehow . 
can't believe he never saw it . Psychology is my future career . After all my attempts at helping people , after watching what happens when I fail ... Why didn't I consider this sooner ?? 
\Most people would rather be certain they’re miserable than risk being happy . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
Gahhh ... Quantum mechanics , psychology , game development , philosophy ... alchemy could be awesome if I could get a degree in it ... So many choices , and seemingly so little time ... 
Several beaks and dozens of talons leaves your hand feeling kinda tingly . 
Crap ... she's going down , with or without me . I need out , but I want back in ... It's a conflict between logic and love , and it's tearing me apart . 
It's amazing how many people a brick can twist and influence . Come on , people . It's a brick . It doesn't think for itself . 
I feel ... strange . After losing something dear to me , I feel like there aren't any holes anymore . This sounds backwards to me . :P 
This world is crumbling . I feel sorry for everyone who contributed . They are their own downfall . When it's finally over , if anyone has any hope left , come find me . I will show you an entirely new world to call home . 
I've decided what I want in life . I want to become a connoisseur of the self , to know exactly who I am and what I expect from the world . I've made significant progress after the chief obstacle removed itself , and the realization of this goal is only another step in the right direction . Many thanks to the obstacle . 
I treat you like a < PROPFEMALE > , but your life is just one big mess . When did your heart go missing ? 
I used to believe that people do not change , but that it was your view of them that did . To an extent , that is still true . But the way you see others begins to change your own character . For some , the way they are seen turns them into what people see . If the will is not strong enough , they will become a faceless representation of who they once were . 
The grass that grows by every stream , \ 
Like < PROPFEMALE > smiles faintly gleam . \ 
Step gently , cause it not to scream , \ 
For it has grown from a lover's dream . 
You have no idea how great it feels to have control over your own happiness for the first time in almost a year . You have no idea how great it feels to have every little piece fall into place . You have no idea how great it feels to watch the person who crippled your life fall to the ground . 
I've got to tear away from you . I left you bruised , you left me broken . Oh , don't try to speak , if you do one thing for me , make yourself numb . Just make yourself numb . 
I have a very good reason behind everything I tell you . It may seem random , but everything I say sculpts the future you see . For your future's sake , as well as mine , pay attention to the things I say . They will either be the truth , or they will direct you to the truth . 
Yes . That show was crap . Yes . It's been said a couple dozen times already . No , that wasn't an accurate representation of Pomona . Yes , that's what they think we're like . Does it matter ? Does any of it really matter ? Personally , I don't give a shit what other bands think of us , becuase we're gonna clean it up , tighten up the screws , and DESTROY the other bands at State . I'm sick of this negativity . 
\I'm holding a Monster in one hand and punching you in the head with the other . How was I supposed to catch you ? \"" 
The world is whatever you make of it . And I'm going to make it the best damn place around . 
Nothing I have ever done has given me as much joy and as much excitement as this . I feel freaking fantastic ! :D 
I lost something very dear to me , but now I realize that it was just getting in the way . It's amazing how different the world can look after you lose your mind . :D 
I value the truth above all else . Some people don't seem to understand that . Stop trying to protect me , stop trying to be kind , and just give me the truth . That is the ultimate kindness to me . 
is thinking of starting another series that will run parallel to ' The Messenger . ' The protagonist's main goal will be to demonstrate how self-destructive the human race is , while proving that the truth is the only valuable concept ( Sound familiar to some ? ) . I don't want to abruptly end ' The Messenger ' to do this , so I plan on weaving the two stories together . Yay or nay ? 
wonders why he always gives the power to someone else . I'm thinking that this is the first situation where I did so for a good reason . That , and I know she won't abuse it like people have in the past . 
Shows are just ... amazing . Regardless of where we finish , it's still a rush . It's still an unforgettable experience . Regardless of how good a show we put on , we're still Pomona . We'll still work out the kinks and come back stronger . 
If you are going to need someone to help you up , make sure it is someone that will always be there to keep you from falling down again . 
Assumptions can be horrifically dangerous . Any assumption , if it isn't already wrong , it will become wrong . I need to stop assuming things about her . 
I know it's sad , but I never gave a damn about the weather , and it never gave a damn about me . 
I'd like the attention of all those pathetic souls that , despite their own retarded mistakes that ruined their life , they blame everyone else : Grow up . That is all . 
Don't lose your mind over someone who doesn't have one left . Things are rarely as they seem . 
16 hour day : Band , band , more band , lunch , band , some more band , a bit more band , < PROPFIRST>'s . Yes . Fun . Awesome . 
Everyone lies . They do so to spare others the pain of the truth . They skew reality , alter perceptions , produce false hope , and all just so they can prolong the pain they will inevitably cause . Do society a favor . Speak the harsh truths , the bitter realities , so that , when we learn to be happy , our happiness is based on something that cannot be taken away . 
It's impossible to take the truth away from someone . It's impossible to take a happiness based on truths away . It's impossible for anyone to take me down . Things are looking up for me , State is gonna be awesome , BK auditions are coming up , and my life has never felt so incredible . 
Juniors , Sophomores , and Freshmen : Help ake this a State performance worthy of being the seniors ' last time on the field . Thank you . \ 
Also , sleeping is difficult right now . :P 
BK is gonna be great . I've only got two weeks to prepare a solo , though ... Shitshitshitshitshit . Can't wait . ^_^ 
All the seniors are going on about how much they'll miss band , and that they're sad it's all over now , so on and so forth . You know how much I'll miss it ? I'm honestly considering doing Blue Knights until I age out , maybe Cavvies at least once , while giving keyboard lessons on the side . After aging out of BK , I'll instruct and give lessons . This is all a very real idea . THAT'S how much I'll miss this . 
I'm lost in my own dreams ; I keeping finding myself in my nightmares . I'm waiting to wake up and expecting to sleep forever . I'm fading into the dusk , seeping through into the < PROPFEMALE > . I am reborn , a second < PROPMALE > ; a second life . I was the setting sun , and now it's time for me to rise . 
I'm shooting for a gentlemanly-looking serial killer , but with a twist . Just something out of the ordinary . Then I found a ginormous lead pipe in the garage , just the right hight for a cane and just the right weight for destroying everything . Perfect . ^_^ 
Five days . Five , painstakingly long days . This is gonna be incredible ... But what do I do for five days ? I should probably learn the rest of the warmups . :P 
There is one good thing about textual communication . Sure , you can't convey the same emotions and it doesn't have as much meaning , but you get something more from it : The truth . People will say so much more through text than they will to your face , and I < PROPFEMALE > that . 
You can yell at me and contradict me all you want , but the truth is still the truth : I have scientifically definied the phenomenon known as ' love . ' 
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE ! GAHH !!! SO MANY EXERCISES , SO LITTLE TIME !!! ** head asplodes ** 
You know what I think ? I think we are all in our private traps , and none of us can ever get out . We scratch and claw , but only at the air , only at each other . And for what ? We never budge an inch . 
48 hours from now , I will begin the process of joining Blue Knights . Two weeks from now , I will be incorporated into the Blue Knights . Maybe a month or so later , I will wear a Blue Knights jacket everywhere I go . Let the double-season begin . :D 
First day of the first camp was awesome . The exercises are awesome . The people are pretty awesome . Being on the same side of the marimba as < PROPMALE > is ... weird ... lol 
Sunday , 3:30 . Then I will know if I'm in or not . A week of suspense had better be worth it . 
Perfectionist tendencies + Rather difficult audition piece + Picky instructor + Only three days left to work on it = Rather stressful . But fun . 
Even when someone whom I hate with a passion asks me for help , I am still compelled to give it . I'm too nice . Damn ... 
The world , as you see it ... isn't . 
Well , it's time to rock the auditions . I want that marimba part . I'm going to get it . Regardless of how many limbs it costs me . 
I'm \technically\ " in Blue Knights now ... " 
Talking to people , it seems that this could still be worth it . Very worth it . And I'm not skipping out on the theme ... I've decided to stay , regardless . I'm in Blue Knights ! :D 
Tell me , I'm curious . Is it worth it ? How much pain must you cause yourself before you realized that you've spent your entire life digging yourself into a hole ? How much harder will you try to ruin another's life before you realized that no one listens ? 
Members of the world , I have news of GRAND IMPORTANCE . I have gazed into the void , stared through the infinity of thought . I have SEEN THE FUTURE , and it is ... yellow . 
Today , I solved ' The Wall ' in record time . I broke the previous record that existed for 7 years . Booyah . 
UPSETTING ! I just found a way to solve the wall in , at most , ten minutes ... sad . \ 
I can't tell anyone , or else my record will die . :P 
The future doesn't need to be bright , I'm afraid of light , I'll just live tonight , and see what happens . I'll start the final fight , my sanity's alright , I'll take you home tonight , and see what happens . 
Half my house disappeared ! 
What good is knowing exactly what you're looking for when the rest of the world doesn't have the slightest idea ? 
I'm playing vibes ! :D \ 
Not only that , but I literally CANNOT play the BK music I'm burning out at 20 bpm under tempo . Time to chop out ! This is gonna be an amazing season . :D 
Real people don't alter their look , their friends , their attitude , their very life , just to satisfy someone else . Respect comes from defiance . If you want respect , then go against what people expect of you . Be yourself to satisfy your own needs , not someone else . Don't be an empty shell , waiting for someone to fill you . 
Somewhere along the way , through the haze of our wild accusations and biased hatred , we have lost sight of the truth . Not just individually , but as a society . It's time to drop the bias , accept alternatives , and find the truth again . 
Truth is , like this and I'll tell you what I don't like about you . Truthfully . 
My life's too short to have a plan . Here , let me help you understand . First take this drink and this pill , relax your mind and be still , let's find out who I am . 
Well , I got cut from my vibes part with BK ... \ 
And was switched to marimba instead . :D 
Is 30 hours of rehearsal a week too much ? Cause it feels great . 
I'm living my life differently , more effectively . Better . After too many years , I am beginning to fully embrace the mantras that I have had set in place forever . I'm living the way I've always wanted to , and no feeling can compare . 
They were ignorant , even of their own death , and they danced for the rest of eternity , unaware that they had died ages ago . 
Jump off the roof , just to see what it feels like to break your legs with concussive force . Who knows ? It might do you some good , later on in life . 
I'm inspired by fear . 
To all who are interested : 720.445.0541 \ 
I got a freaking phone . Finally . Text me . 
.... Holy shit . xD\ 
I passed English with a 60.98% \ 
I passed History with a 60.69% \ 
And THAT is how you PROcrastinate . Like a pro . WIN . 
It's crazy how selective my caring can be . I love it . Let me know when you want me to care again . xD 
I HAVE SEEN THE INFINITY OF NOTHING . IT'S ALL RIGHT , I GUESS . 
Scott : I wish I could turn into a morphing ball and roll to the bathroom from here , instead of having to get up . \ 
Ramona : I used to know a guy who could do that . He said it wasn't that great . 
I can grow flowers . I can plant trees and build houses . I can form mountains . I can create tornadoes and hurricanes and volcanoes . I can destroy the world , I can freeze the sun . I can tear the fabric of space and enter the void . I can meld heaven and hell into one . I can end the universe , if I so choose . I can create a better one . 
just WON the party ! 
Got the original sheet music for ' The Entertainer . ' I know I can't play it worth crap , but that doesn't stop me from trying ... xD 
Three days , 31 hours of rehearsal . My mind and hands are dead . I am happy . ^_^ 
The new year is upon us , and I want to try something . Post your new year resolutions here , and they will all evolve into a short story . I'm not sure how this will work , but I'm anxious to see what happens . Post your resolutions ! :D 
My new year's resolution : F**k the past . 
Life is a game . Happiness is a gamble . Sorrow is the worst-case scenario . Play the game , take the chances . It will definitely be worth it . 
can't decide between between Parkour and 70s cop show ... Hmm ... 
“We’ve traveled too far , and our momentum has taken over ; we move idly towards eternity , without possibility of reprieve or hope of explanation . ” –Guildenstern 
If the internet were to have an official spokesperson , it would be Parry Gripp . 
Bleeding is the aftermath of getting cut . It is not the blood itself that hurts , but it is a memory that you were , once , injured . The cut can heal , but the blood will stain . Some pains were not meant to be forgotten . 
If two plus two is four , then why do I still feel like a three ? 
I have heard the voice of the rosewood . I have made it speak . I am enlightened . 
I miss having free time ... Not . This is an awesome schedule . Music , music , music , more music ... ^_^ 
< PROPMALE > Adams is one hoopy frood . 
Congratz to my good friend < PROPFIRST > Sellers That is all . 
I lost my breath , but when I went back to look for it , it was nowhere to be found ... 
Time flies when you're burning up on re-entry . 
Not only do I want to be the guy , but I'm in en route to the Guy's fortress as we speak . 
Alcohol is not the answer . It just makes you forget the question . 
After 10 hours , 17 minutes , 10 seconds , and 3257 deaths , I have become THE GUY . 
Don't look for the answer until you fully understand the implications of the question . 
What time is it when you run out of ice cream ? Time to die . 
You know what I love ? Performing a good show in a great ensemble with awesome people . That's living . It's great . 
Facebook , you're a great psychiatrist and all , but I think it's your turn for some help . What's on YOUR mind ? 
Chewing out the percussion ensemble for screwing around 97% of the time is strangely satisfying ... 
Perdidi amicum hodie . Absorbuerat capra . 
Music : Satisfaction guaranteed . 
Hey there , Delilah . \ 
What's it like in New York City ? \ 
I might be arranging this song\ 
So that you can play it with me . 
Four performances ... One day ... Funfunfun . ^_^ 
Mortal Kombat II : $1299.99 with $299.99 shipping . \ 
Cost to play : $0.25 \ 
Pomona population : ~ 1750 * 50% ( Likely demographic to play ) = 875\ 
Assuming only one game per student , it'll be paid off in ... Only two weeks . ^_^ 
I like it when other people win at the pickle bar . ^_^ 
California here we come , right back where we started from . 
So Cal is a wonderful place ... Yesterday felt like a week . 
AWESOME . I just won the BK scholarship , AND paid off all my fees for the season . I am happy . :D
