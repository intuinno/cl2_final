Holidays are tough ... We wish heaven had a phone so we could hear your voice again . We thought of you today , but that is nothing new . We thought of you yesterday and the days before that too . We think of you in silence and often speak your name . All we have are memories and pictures in a frame . Repost if you have someone in heaven that you miss here on earth .

I grew up reciting this every morning in school with my hand over my heart . We no longer do this for fear of offending someone ! How many of my fellow Americans will re-post this and not care about offending someone ! 
I have a wonderful man , who helps balance my whole world , who isn't perfect , but is perfect for me , who works hard and would do anything for me , who makes me laugh and drives me crazy , who is my best friend , who I want to grow old with , whom I am thankful for everyday , and whom I could not live without . I love you babe !
