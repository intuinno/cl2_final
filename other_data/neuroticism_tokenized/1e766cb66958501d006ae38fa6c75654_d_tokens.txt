Since I'm very bored at the moment , like this status andd I'll do an ' I must admit ' for you ! (: 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB till Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same . 
If your mom \ 
is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best mom ever , \ 
whether you are blessed to still have your mom with you or if she is an \ 
angel in heaven , copy and paste this into your status and let everyone \ 
know you are proud of your mom and that you love her . I love you mom . 
Can't wait for Christmas ! (: \ 
Haha , I'm like a little kid again ! :D 
I’m not a perfect girl . My hair doesn’t always stay in one place & and I spill things a lot . I’m pretty clumsy & sometimes I have a broken heart . My friends & I sometimes fight & maybe some days nothing goes right . But when I think about it & take a step back . I remember how amazing life truly is & that maybe . Just maybe . I like being unperfect .. 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! :) 
what's your New Years resolution ? 
Rainbow Sherbet . ? 
There comes a point in your life when you get tired of chasing everyone and trying to fix everything , but it’s not giving up . It’s realizing you don’t need certain people and the drama they bring .....
