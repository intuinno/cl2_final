has finished Dresden Files Book #3 - and man , the final fight was epic ! 
' s flat tire makes with the sad make . :( 
\In the name of the Pizza Lord ! Charge ! \"" 
Book #4 of the Dresden Files has been consumed . 
Transformers : robot violence was well done . It had some very intricate fight scenes that many animators choose to avoid . The writing ? insipid . Honestly , pretty disappointing . If they wanted it to be funny , they should've hired a better writer . 
< PROPMALE > ( with umlaut ) was a riot . I laughed pretty hard throughout the entire movie . Vulgar in the extreme , and not recommended for those that didn't like Borat . 
I saw < PROPMALE > Potter < PROPFEMALE > . Pretty cool , the movie was nice to watch . However , I wasn't amazed . 
has just finished #5 of the dresden files . Wow 
Blizzcon in a week ! hoping for new Diablo 3 information . 
the new minkey island was total brolocaust . courtesy of vgcats 
District 9 was amazing , go watch it . Warning : may make you dislike your fellow humans more than you do right now . 
PS3 slim for $300 ? Coming out in september ?! I'm gonna have to double check this info ...

So class #4 for Diablo III is the monk !? I hope it turns out good . 
Man , I love me some Invader Zim . Just saw the season 3 christmas episode . 
finished another 2 classes . I'm positive I got an A in writing , not so sure about economics though . I'm #1 in the class , but I had a 93% before the final , and I don't think everything is graded . Hope I keep my A 
Physics today ! 
The new Okami game is coming out for nintendo DS . !!! Now I REALLY need to pick one up ... 
Also : ps3 slim for $300 as of today . I better get a tutoring position soon

The Men who stare at Goats was funny . You folk should see it .

The Tofu is angry ! http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/27079 
Know what sucks ? When you spend an hour+ modeling a head , and you find out that your thumb drive where you saved it got wiped by the computers at school . 
wonders what he should do for his birthday next weekend ... 
stupid 3ds < PROPMALE > . I finish modeling out a hand , then it freezes on me and I have to start over again . X ( 
Know what sucks ? I just spent an hour modeling out a hand in 3ds < PROPMALE > , and then it freezes on me and I lose the work I did . x ( 
I'm done ! screw you 3ds < PROPMALE > ! 
is gaming while waiting for the TG lunch to begin . 
appreciates all of the well wishes ! Thanks everyone . 
just played the Bayonetta demo . If you like Devil May Cry at all , play it . Now . 
\The Road\ " : not so much \ " cannibal thriller\ " as it was a \ " starvation drama \"" 
If there is one thing I HATE about Itunes , it's that I can't transfer songs I've purchased from my ipod to my computer after it's been reformatted . 
just read 58 pages of failblog.org ... 
I just saw Avatar and Shelock Holmes today . Both of them were awesome , and worth the experience . 
Happy Yule ! 
Finished First Lord's Fury today . Very satisfying series 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and ... are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... they have been eaten by dragons . 
Midterms this week ! 
Go to urbandictionary.com and type in ur first name . Copy and past this as ur status and then put ur meaning as ur own first comment ... 
I've run out of stuff that allows me to procrastinate on this project ... 
AZ Renaisance fair started this weekend ... 
Finished a ( relatively ) difficult boggle program . yay ! Now for some extra features ... 
I hates research papers ! 
Video game withdrawl :P 
Not only do I have finals next week for Film & Lit and Datastructures & < PROPFEMALE > , but I don't know what to do with my facial hair ... 
That < PROPFEMALE > person is a bot . You know , the one that is sending those advertisements to you all ? Block and dump it . 
Flying out to Las Vegas tomorrow evening . Hope to see people this week . yay ! 
One final down , one to go . then Vegas ! 
I'm in Vegas . Plans to drive out to cali and go to Six Flags this weekend commence tomorrow 
I do <3 march and april in Phoenix 
I keep talking about how cool Cthulhu is , but I've never read any of H.P. Lovecrafts work . I picked up the Necronomicon last night , and look forward to the read . 
http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/28300 Funny god of war commercial . 
I saw Avenue Q live last night . It's pretty funny , and does a good job of outshining the soundtrack . 
God of War 3 comes out tomorrow . I know what I'm blowing $60 on 
pedometer 
Face-sunburns suck 
I've come into the possession of a Wii , despite acknowledging that the X360 is a better investment . Damn you Nintendo ! 
I've played two hours of God of War 3 today . I love it . <3 
Phanny burp 
Boobquake on facebook 
Man , it is hard to out down Changes by Butcher . So awesome ! 
Just finished butcher's latest entry to the Dresden files : Changes . Very awesome . Just wish I didn't have to wait a year for the next entry . 
Got A's in my 20th century history and math for game programming classes . 
Muramasa has been an amazing game . I've been playing Kisuke's story on hard , and I'm on the final chapter . 
I just finished reading a Knaak book . Why do I keeping reading his stuff ? I don't like any of it . < PROPMALE > Weeks though ? Awesome . I'm a third of the way through \the Way of Shadows\ " . It's basically a novel about ninjas . His story grabs me and makes it hard to stop reading . " 
I need some hot currey to clear up this cold of mine . 
3D < PROPFEMALE > Game Heroes came out today . I'm going to have to acquire it . ( yay ! ) 
I just finished the Night Angel Trilogy . Freakin ' awesome . 
Have you heard of a movie called \Human Centipede\ " ? A sergeon kidnaps 3 tourists and sows them together mouth-to-butt . " 
I've played the first 30 minutes of 3D < PROPFEMALE > Game Heroes . It's pretty sweet . You have access to the character builder from the beginning of the game , and the game comes with a bunch of crazy character options ( that all fit into one of the three classes ) . For example , I chose to play as a mech . It isn't any larger than normal characters , but it's amusing none the less . 
Queso fresca : Mexican bathtub cheese 
to devry-phoenix : don't take any classes with < PROPMALE > diele . He doesn't teach anything that he tests on . 
Got around to seeing how to train your dragon . Pretty funny 
E3 in a week from tomorrow ( EEEEEEEE ! ) 
So I am flying to Vegas for a week , and I get in wednesday afternoon on the 16th . Lemme know if & when you'd like to < PROPFEMALE > out . Beware : limited mobility 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwvVh0_ZelI&sns=em\ 
\ 
Hilarious . Soccer + binoculars 
I just beat the latest entry of the < PROPMALE > of Persia series . A fun game , it was worth the time I invested into it . However , it's a renter , not a buyer . It doesn't have any replay value if you beat it on it's highest difficulty setting ( medium ) . 
Thank you for assuming the party going submission position . 
E3 ! Pay attention to it . They are shipping 360 slims that have 250gb drives and built in wifi for $300 . I'm going to have to pick one up now . 
I fly out to vegas today . I'm stoked , and hope to see you guys 
Pro tip from my grandma : put aluminum foil around the burners on the oven . Makes the mess easier to clean up later . 
Just watches < PROPFIRST > Darko . Pretty cool movie . 
I just ate lunch at the spicy pickle . Awesome food . 
Got to see A-Team yesterday . It's a decent action movie . Worth catching if your action movie quota hasn't been met this summer . 
Today is my last day in Vegas . I fly out at 8:45 . Im sorry I didn't get to say high to everyone , bit I'm never a stranger and hope to visit again in 4 months or so . We'll see 
I miss las Vegas already . It's so much hotter out here in Phoenix . \ 
Also , great deals on the avatar seasons at SAMs club . They have them for $28 each . 
The lease has been signed and the move is complete . Now , I live in tempe . I'll put up photos soonish 
Just saw The Last Airbender . It was ok . They need to fire their martial arts consultant and work on their pacing though . 
Indeed , happy Independence Day . 
back to school , back to school ... 
Day 1 of System Architecture and Assembler in progress ... 
Cho Aniki will evetually be released onto PSN 
Just got borderlands for PS3 . 
~ 3 months to go till Castle Crashers hits PSN , if deathspank's submission and arrival on each of the console stores is any indication . 
Shank comes out Aug . 25th : must buy ! 
Resistance down , now for Arkham Asylum . 
http://www.teenbubblegum.com/legend-of-korra-the-new-avatar-series/1575/ 
I just saw Sorcerer's Apprentice and Despicable Me . Sorcerer's Apprentice was cool , but flawed . Despicable Me was hilarious , and totally worth seeing . 
I got my bed today . Pretty excited about it , though I need to let I expand before I use it . 
Just beat batman : arkham asylum . One of the funnest games I've played in a while . If you haven't played it , you should really do something about it . 
Enter week 2 with the new sumolounge memory foam mattress : It still smells . It was read for use within 24 hours , but the smell continues to smell after many days of airing . I have purchased a waterproof mattress cover in hopes of containing it's chemical stink . The bed is pretty firm , but comfortable . If I have to do this for all other memory foam beds I buy , then this may be the last one : P . 
I beat the first level of the < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World Game . It's pretty sweet , especially if you liked the TMNT games from the 90's . 
I just got out of < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The world . So . Freakin ' . Awesome . ( not recommended for those prone to seizures or those who don't have a taste for the absurd ) 
6 gauge vinyl mattress cover > chemical preservative used in memory foam mattresses ( just wash your mattress cover before you use it ) 
Shank = 2d devil may cry . It is pretty fun . Totally worth the buy 
Shank single player is awesome , albeit short . Just bought castle crashers ( yay ! ) , and I have started working on it . 
Machete tonight . 
Inception was epic . And excellent . 
Just found out that the Xbox 360 DLC for castle crashers was included for free in the PS3 release . The characters are unlocked by playing through insane mode , and the pets are up for purchase from the insane store . 
Do you guys remember Poop Dog from Invader Zim ? 
Anyone know of some solid death metal bands that are produced by Sony ? I've got 50 free songs from them and I'm having a hard time settling . 
I should probably get to work ... 
Taintlight is soooo bad . Funny , but only if you're into bad spoof movies . 
Just played the vanquish demo . So sweet . Check it out 
I am zack2216 on xbox live . Hit me up 
Yar , it be the day to be talkin ' like a pirate . 
President's List certificate . Again ... 
The Other Guys was pretty funny . I haven't seen a Will Ferrel movie in a while . 
Make this your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy , but the evil ... Empire continues to kill innocent civilia ... ns . 93% ... won't copy/paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
ATTENTION !!!!!!!!! Do\ 
NOT join the group currently on Facebook with the title \Becoming a \ 
If the rain keeps up like this , we're going to flood in central Phoenix . 
So , traffic was bad all around due to inclement weather . Home safe despite either 
Just got done with my first game of frisbee golf . Pretty fun 
Just saw \Easy A . \ " Pretty funny spin on classic high school drama . It's worth seeing . " 
procrastinating on facebook ... 
Luffy is so awesome .

It's < PROPMALE > potter day at work . I didn't dress up ... 
Son of a ... The right bumper on my dsi broke > < 
I got my DSi back from nintendo , and it's all better ! 
Just realized the other day that because I'm flying out to Utah for thanksgiving , I won't be able to go tv shopping on black Friday ... 
Flying out to Ogden tomorrow for Thanksgiving weekend . 
Safely in Ogden , hanging out with the fam . 
Happy , Thanksgiving ? 
Thanks for the well wishes guys . 
Thanks again everyone ^^ 
< PROPFIRST > , I caught the flu , and I blame you for inhibiting my cake consuming capabilities . XP 
For those that didn't know , Robot Chicken < PROPFEMALE > Wars episode 3 is premiering this sunday . Sweet ! 
Yay , all done for this session winter break starts now ! 
< PROPFIRST > Fullerton found that if you use heat to erase a magnetic field , he could \reprogram\ " material to have multiple north and south poles of differing strengths . " 
Kung fu movies I must watch : Ip man , dragon tiger gate ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas you folk . 
So . many . UDK . tutorials . 
Know what I haven't watched in a while ? Zero Punctuation . So funny . 
How bigoted do you have to be to protest the funeral of a nine year old girl because you believe that god is punishing Americans for being tolerant of homosexuality ? 
5 day weekend and no money to travel . 
Kahlua + Chocolate Almond Milk = Awesome 
Oh homework , how I postpone thee . 
It's official : I'm going to GDC at the beginning of March . I have an extra day to fart around in San < PROPFIRST > , so what should I do ? 
Just beat ninja gaiden sigma on normal . Not gonna play on , that game is frustrating enough as it is . Terrible camera , finicky controls , and cheap bosses . I am disappointed with the last couple boss fights though . I one shot the final boss . They just weren't as broken as doku fight 2 ( the ghost ) . Kinda feeling an rpg next . 
I'm seriously considering going on vacation to Vegas next week Tuesday , and staying till Sunday . How's that sound to you LV folk ? 
I'm heading out to las Vegas tomorrow , and I'm staying till sunday with < PROPMALE > . Let me know if and when you want to < PROPFEMALE > out . 
Pulse by < PROPFIRST > Giles- get it . 
Rolling out . keep in touch ... 
Just got into kingman . 130 < PROPMALE > outside of phoenix my 5th gear goes out , and I've been drivin in 4th since . I think I know what I'm going to be doing when I get to las Vegas ... 
OMG Zaba's! 
Just dropped the car off at a transmission shop . $285 just to look ! I'm currently making my way back to < PROPMALE>' house . 
Slidin Thru : awesome mini-burger shop in vegas on sunset , just ate there with < PROPMALE > , Calais , and their awesome friends < PROPFIRST > and his GF . I had a pulled pork sandwich and s'more fries ( sweet potato fries with marshmallow , chocolate syrup and crumbled < PROPMALE > cracker . So good 
Car update : I've retrieved my loot from the car and I'm abandoning it to the shop . At least I still have my motorcycle . 
\Bad decisions make great stories . \ " -Nic Butler " 
Just got home ok from Las Vegas . Now I'm about to turn around and road trip to SF . 
We're in San < PROPFEMALE > , 40 minutes away from the nintendo keynote and running late . 
Day 1 of GDC went well , despite not getting to go to the nintendo keynote . The awards shows were pretty good , and the winners deserved the rewards they received . We might go to an < PROPMALE > show tonight , since nothing is scheduled to happen after GDC's lectures and stuff end at 5:30 . The < PROPMALE > show is displaying video game < PROPMALE > , so that would be cool to see . I hope it's free ... 
Day 2 of GDC was cool . < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and I covered all but one final corner of the show room floor . However , we are more likely to buy things/services from them than we are to get hired by them . We still haven't taken advantage of the free sessions . 
Ninja is so much fun ! 
I'm at my first Indian buffet , naan•n•curry in San < PROPFEMALE > . So good . 
The 3rd and final day of GDC has come to a close . < PROPFIRST > won a solid state drive , and we all got another T-shirt . Today is tourist day , and < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > want to visit Alcatraz . I was hoping to stop by < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s also . I'll have to bring up your previous suggestions to the guys for consideration . 
Waiting in line outside of < PROPMALE>'s for a super < PROPFIRST > sandwich . Looks like a lounge . 
Home again after a 13 hour drive . Small world , but the hostel I was stating at was a block away from Millennium . I didn't grab any dessert though . I'll have to remember for next year . 
BTBAM is going to be in arizona 5/7 for their new album . Must see ! 
I'm terribly unmotivated to do my homework right now .
