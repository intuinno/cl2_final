SNOW AT THE CITADEL ! CANCEL SMI !!! 
KICK ASS was freakin ' awesome ! One of the best movies I've seen this year .

Thus forcing you to turn around and run three < PROPMALE > back home in the dark as flashes of lightning illuminate the sky from the approaching thunderstorm . Bottomline : tired+dark+traffic and lightning = STUPID IDEA !

What do ya ' do when a blonde throws a grenade at you ?... Pull the pin and throw it back . Sorry in advance to all the blondes .

The Walkind Dead is a television masterpiece ! 
It's snowing on Christmas day , coincidence ?... I say NOT , the government is behind it . 
So I just saw on the news a guy here in NC decided to play Frogger for real and got hit by an SUV . He was talking about it with his friends , yelled GO and ran across a fourlane highwy thus using his last life before his game was over .
