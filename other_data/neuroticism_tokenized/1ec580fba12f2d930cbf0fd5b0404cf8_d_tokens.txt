Having fun learning about facebook . Had a good day , resolved two difficult AEL Help Desk Issues at our Project Sites in New York City and Albany < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > and I enjoyed < PROPFEMALE>'s Christmas Concert . I can't wait to see < PROPFEMALE>'s Christmas Concert ! Now I just have to decide if I will buy the house on Dellwood or wait until something becomes available in Lakewood . 

House Hunting - I was driving through Lakewood yesterday and I thought I should wait for something in Lakewood . This Morning I thought , I should get the home in Avon Lake and be done with it . Just checked my email and there is a great new listing in Lakewood . Argh ! 
Playing Hide and Seek with < PROPFEMALE > after an exhausting day . I hide and < PROPFEMALE > counts backwards from 100 by 10’s , no problem . < PROPFEMALE > ’s turn to hide , I count ; 100 , 90 , 80 , 70 , 60 , 50 , 40 , 30 , 12 , I mean 20 , 11 , I mean 10 , 9 , I mean zero , no , one , I mean one !, at which point < PROPFEMALE > comes out of hiding and says , Dad , you’ll do better next time ! 
Driving home with my girls with the radio on . I remark , hey , that’s a remake of an old 80’s song . < PROPFEMALE > ( my 11 year old ) – Why are eighties remakes so whiny ? I say , we had passion in the 80’s . < PROPFEMALE > - yeah and didn’t they have socks that went up to your knees too ? I quietly say yes . < PROPFEMALE > – the 80’s seem so lame . I say , quit ripping on my decade . < PROPFEMALE > - Ripping on my decade , Exactly ! 
hey its < PROPFEMALE > jerrys daughter and i am amazing !!!!! oh yah !!!!! 
Up and Down , Up and Down , Curve to the Right , Curve to the Left , and Really Super Fast ( Except when its Super Foggy like this morning ) . Driving 120 < PROPMALE > in West < PROPFEMALE > is so much fun but it also makes me super tired ( I'm not in my 20's anymore ! ) . Beautiful Mountains , Nice People , but I will be glad be home tomorrow . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
There is nothing more devastating than creating a < PROPFEMALE > sand boy clone army only to have your daughter knock them down like dominoes and use them to create a fortress for her < PROPFEMALE > sand girl clone army ! Oh the humanity ! 
My luggage didn’t make it to Indianapolis this morning . It’s 9:41 pm and I’m still waiting for the folks from United to deliver my one bag to my hotel . I have been up since 3:00 am and I don’t think I can stay up much longer . Oh well , I’m sure the folks at < PROPFIRST > University won’t mind if I wear the same clothes tomorrow ! Other than that things are going well as I assess potential rooms for an AEL . 
The front desk called . My luggage is here ! Now I can finally get some rest . 
Sitting at Indianapolis International Airport waiting to depart to Chicago while the maintenance crew works on the brakes . Will miss my connecting flight in Chicago to < PROPMALE > , but “guaranteed” a seat on the next available flight . Are brakes really necessary to slow a plane down ? Isn’t that what flaps are for ? At times like these , I always ask myself WWFFD ( What would < PROPFIRST > Flintstone Do) ? Yabba Dabba Do ! 
Just got back home ! Apparently the plane was leaking brake fluid , but they were able to fix it . In any case , I was totally prepared to kick out the floor board and stop the plane with my heels if the brakes failed ! :) My travel bag didn’t make the connection with me , so I guess I will get my stuff back tomorrow . I suppose I’ll have to wear the same clothes to work , right ? :) It’s good to be home . 
While dropping off the girls at their Mothers , I mentioned that I was going to get a < PROPFEMALE > tonight . I noticed in the rear-view mirror that < PROPFEMALE > was getting a weepy . I asked what was wrong and < PROPFEMALE > says , “I love you Daddy , and I don't want you to be alone tonight . ” She is such a sweetie ! It took awhile , but < PROPFEMALE > finally got that I was getting a < PROPFEMALE > . She felt much better ! 
Every time I see < PROPFEMALE > standing next to her Mother , I am amazed that < PROPFEMALE > is taller than her Mom ! How did this happen ? When did this happen ? How did things get to this point ? Don't get me wrong , it's not that I haven't looked forward to < PROPFEMALE > getting older , I'm just shocked that it happened so soon . Amazing . 
I find myself awake 6:30 am on Saturday Morning . My girls are sleeping and as I look out of my living room window I notice a half < PROPFEMALE > behind the branches of the trees . For the first time this winter , I heard birds chirping as < PROPFEMALE > approches . It is so peaceful and I am grateful for this moment and all the gifts I have in this life . 
It’s 7:30 in the morning and I find myself awake To dishes in the sink from dinner and laundry that has to be washed ! Birds chirping before < PROPFEMALE > will be replaced with girls complaining that they don’t want to go to church and do thier weekend school assignments . Oh yeah , and swimming too ! What a difference an hour makes ! :) 
< PROPFEMALE > lost her first tooth today ! She was so excited all evening , she finally fell asleep . I hope the tooth < PROPFEMALE > brings her something special ! 
Playing Farmville with < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > harvested all of my soybeans , planted red tulips , fertilized all of my neighbors crops and sent gifts to everyone . What a busy morning ! :) I on the other hand , shamelessly asked for wooden planks and horseshoes for my stable ! 
What a month ! Moved into my new house in Lakewood , Managed the installation of a New Aerospace Education Laboratory at < PROPFIRST > University , and didn’t skip a beat with my girls with all of their activities , illnesses , sleepovers , and birthday parties ! Now if it would just stop raining long enough I can get back to my gardening ! 
I missed < PROPFEMALE > ’s Soccer Game this past weekend , so I asked her how it went . < PROPFEMALE > replied , “We lost again and it’s all Grace’s fault ! ” I said , “Now , now , < PROPFEMALE > , you win as a team and you lose as a team” to which she replied , “I know , Dad , we lost because Grace on the other team scored all of the goals ! ” 
While giving me a big hug , < PROPFEMALE > tells me in her sweet six year old voice , “Daddy , you’re the best Dad because you’re the softest Dad ! ” I suppose being a slightly out of shape middle aged Dad isn’t always a bad thing :) 
The first double sleepover at my new house . The Voltz sisters ( Ages 12 and 6 ) and the Vizdos sisters ( Ages 12 and 6 ) . Just got back from Malley’s and Lakewood Park . Having fun watching the girls having a blast . I just love being back in Lakewood ! I have really missed being in such a diverse and eclectic city . Very Nice . 
Weeds , Weeds , Weeds , Peppermint , Peppermint , Peppermint , Clover , Clover , Clover . Tackled side and behind the garage today . I have 4 lawn and refuse bags full of this stuff . I guess that’s better than the 20 bags I had back in March when I pulled all the overgrowth rest of the garden ! Haven’t decided what to do about my newly deforested area , but I better decide soon , or I will be doing this again next month ! 
Grey Clouds , Breezy Rain , Peaceful Morning . I really don’t want to wake my sleeping girls . I will hold off as long as I can until I get them up , make them breakfast and drop them off at daycare before I head off to work . 
Had a great time at the LHS 30 year reunion !!! Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and everyone else who made it happen ! It was really nice to see everyone and again , just had a great time catching up and reminiscing ! 
So I am getting < PROPFEMALE > ready for daycare , I ask her if there is anything special about today . After considerable thought , the light bulb clicks on and she says , “Today is the day we get to go bowling at Glenview ! ” Absolutely Correct ! I ask her if there is anything else , and she smiles and says Happy Birthday Dad ! So there you have it . For those of you who are lucky enough to go bowling today , enjoy ! 
I am in Indianapolis for this weekend to attend the dedication of the Aerospace Education Laboratory at < PROPFIRST > University . Went to Marsh Supermarket , got lots of fruit ( and some cookies ) and rented “A Single Man” . Just finished watching it and I enjoyed it very much . < PROPMALE > Firth and < PROPFEMALE > Moore were wonderful ( as always ) . Well , I better get to bed , lots of preparation for the dedication tomorrow . 
While eating dinner with < PROPFEMALE > ( my youngest ) , I noticed she was trying to eat and cover her ears . When I asked why she was covering her ears , her replay was , “its chat chat chat all day long and it’s the only way I can get peace and quiet ! ” One of the many reasons I love my daughters ! 
I am having a great movie weekend ! Two great movies back to back ! My car is in great shape ! What else can go right ? Now it’s time to clean my messy house and then to the park for a brisk winter walk ! 
What a holiday season ! My car broke down Christmas Day ( broken clutch ) , and it just got out of the shop today ( Yay ! ) I am so fortunate to have so many friends and family that shuttled Me and my girls to all of the Christmas Day festivities and gave me use of a vehicle until I could get a rental ( try getting a car rental on the weekend of Christmas ! ) :) . All in all , a great Christmas for all of us .
