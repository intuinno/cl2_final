Dude ! I barely noticed that < PROPFIRST > Arvizu , called me . XD Sorry I was actually working . 
I saw the fifty flavors of Jelly Bellys and I thought of < PROPFEMALE > Areli Vazquez . Good times . But I hated the popcorn ones . >.< 
Okay you see a group of guys or girls . You notice on in particular and think ... their hot/cute ... etc . They turn around and you notice their your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend . Has that happened to you ? XD 
Never keep a Krabby < PROPFEMALE > for over 6 hours . Lesson of the day . 
-Nothing is impossible . The word itself says \I'm possible\ " . You are capable of everything you set your mind to . " 
Really wish I wasn't working on Wednesday . Best outing and I have to work ... -sigh ; 
Yes , it's true . I've made mistakes . I really don't care anymore . I'm done . :) And if people try to put me down , I'll simply smile and walk away . I'm tired , I'm just going to be me . :D 
Staying up just to tell < PROPMALE > ' happy birthday ' . :D 
Wants to marry someone on facebook . :) And no Carlitos Vences , you are the one on drugs , not me . don't use that lie to hide what you do ! 
Carlitos Vences , uses cocaine and is over-the-top gay . He just needs to come out of the closet . :) 
I'd really love it if people stop commenting that one photo . I'm probably gonna delete it now . 
Pancakes for tomorrow is canceled . :-( sorry guys ... not everyone can make it . 
>.< Don't you hate those days at work when there is absoultly nothing to do . I'm falling asleep .... Can't wait to leave and go home then get ready to leave for the movie with the family . Again . :) 
And somehow , someway my bestfriend < PROPFIRST > Meza , makes everything all better . :) 
Now I know why . (: I love my bestfriend . <3 It's Jesse-11 : Nicky-39 :D Ad we have a war coming up . haha . Let's see who wins that for three points ! 
It's the birthday of one of my greatest friends . :) and < PROPFIRST > , if you hadn't realized that it's you I'mma smack you ;)

Lets see who's brave enough to copy and paste this on their status . * Three people are poking me already so they don't count . :) It's a war . 
Never try going on Facebook with a baby girl crying in your arms . She'll drop ypur phone or hit with a dorito !!! 
< PROPFIRST > !!! D: I need my bestfriend to help me . I got stuck again :/ 
One more poke from < PROPFEMALE > Areli Vazquez , and I'll de-daughter her . Okay , I won't but I'll very much consider it ! :D

Apparently , I'm nice . Too nice probably . :D ? 
I don't like you (: 
Have you ever just wanted to be gone . Or never-born ? Well that's how I'm feeling . Sometimes the littlest things have a great impact , mine is in a negative way . I better be prepared to say goodbye to people . If only I had a second < PROPMALE > .? 
I finally got my new phone (: It's the same number . so text it or ask for it . :D 
Loves the carnival ... hates the amount of people that go (: 
< PROPFEMALE > Ceballos is my bubble wrap (: < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , I love you ! haha . Friends that you can turn to for anything (: Even for a lie . And I don't need a date for homecoming (: ? 
Don't you hate it when you really need to talk to someone and they don't answer ! 
So , I've been waiting for this particular soccer game . I'm all excited for it . Turns out , it's today ! The day I work ! FML >.< I wanted to gooo .... ugh . 
I'mma do this again .... Like this and I'll tell you what I like about you , dislike , a confession and my first impression (: PLUS ! I'll tell you a good memory we have .?

This day sucks ! I'mma die out here . 
INBOXONLY !! \ 
Tell me something you've always wanted to tell me , it stays between us ..... put this as your status and see what you get . :D 
As long as < PROPFIRST > Castrejon , < PROPMALE > Carmona , Grecia Perez , < PROPFIRST > Banda < PROPFEMALE > Areli Vazquez , and Egben < PROPMALE > suffer with me , it makes this day ... a little less lonely . 
Today , is actually a good day :D 
Cintia Flores is my hero :D 
If you still need a costume , it'd just be so much better if you wrap yourself in toilet paper than going to Party City . 
I'm so happy and so hyper . Today was a great day :D An amazing start to an amazing weekend (: ? 
Halloween . Honestly , my favorite Holiday <3 Can't wait for today . Yeterday was fun today is gonna be amazing :D Oh , Happy Halloween Everyone :D ? 
Sometimes , you will be the happiest person in the world . But during that time , people will try to make your smile disappear . Through all of it , you have to keep walking and ignore it . Even though it means losing people and a little bit of struggle . It's life , it goes on just like you should .? 
I love Grecia Perez's face when I prayed for her :D Her eyes popped out XD 
Truth is ... 
Highlights of my day : Taping my mouth shut in Physics . Looking Pretty :D ( According to some ) Being overly dramatic to my mom . Losing my ring and getting a five second heart attack then realizing who has it :D Finding < PROPFIRST > to take the damn Christmas photo . Doing amazing notes for Global and having someone make me smile <3 ? 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Banda IFLY ! <3 ? 
Sweetdreams :D ? 
Like this and I'll post why you are my friend , a good memory , what I like and dislike about you , a I must admit and something sweet (: 
My work day is over :D 
The most stupidest things make my whole day :D \ 
I love you if you made me smile to day <3 
< PROPMALE > Rodriguez is awesome (: 
< PROPFIRST > Meza is the awesomest !! :D 
So today was national Mad day . Even after 4:30 everyone was still in a fkd up mood . Today will be better , I'mma hopefully coach < PROPFEMALE > :D 
I loved being Judge :D 
So turns out my cousin wants to be a debater :D She's made me so proud , especially when I saw her debate for the first time . They grow up so fast . -tear ; -tear ; 
I'm sorry I'm not skinny enough so you can see my ribs . I'm sorry my boobs aren't big enough . I'm sorry I'm not fake . I'm sorry I'm not pretty . But most of all , I'm sorry you can't accept me for who I am . 
Like this and I'll see what's up with ya :D 
< PROPMALE > Rodriguez you are annoying ! :D But Ily <3 
Screw it :/ 
So I'm totally passing the World History test tomorrow (: I\mma keep my A C : I love writing all over < PROPMALE>'s wall <3 " 
Like this and I'll answer these questions honestly ... 1)Are you cute or ugly ? 2)Would I date you 3)rate you ?? 4)awesome/lame friend ?? 5)what's the best thing I like about you ?? Youu have been dared to put this as your status . 
I learned today that no matter what I can't always make things right . I can't always expect things to just happen . But I can try . If it doesn't work then too bad . I have to take it . I need to work hard for the things I want . And if I don't get them , it was for good reason . 
So , I'm an albino (: Damn proud of that . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > ... by many you will be missed . As much as we want to , we can't bring you back ... 
Sometimes life decides to take a turn . We imagine it as the most possible worst , but in reality it can be the most amazing thing that has ever happened . 
I'm thankful for my mom . I'm thankful for my brothers . I'm thankful for my family . I'm thankful for my friends . I'm thankful for my school , even though I barely have time it helped me meet some amazing people . I'm thankful for everyone I met , everyone that made me laugh . Everyone that has helped me out . Everyone who never left me , who accepted my flaws and are still able to love me <3 I am thankful for this life I have 
I'm thankful for you because .... 
My family is the most loudest , craziest and ... yeah . XD 
The only way to look beautiful is with make-up . wish I could go back to those days where I didn't have to do anything and I looked pretty . 
I love being on skype with Savina < PROPFEMALE > Avila <3 
\Here's the situation been to every nation . Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do . You know my motivation given my reputation \"< 3 -Thank you < PROPMALE > Ballesteros for getting that song in my head . :D " 
H . M . <3 
So here's the thing , you try your hardest to look pretty and you don't get a single compliment . You wish for that one guy to talk to you , or even take a glance . In reality , you don't need to try hard . People don't say things because they know you are trying . That guy won't talk to you because he isn't worth it . So for once , look like you and not like a doll . 
Screw it , I'm bored . \ 
Like and I'll rate you along with something that I LOVE about you ? 
I love the first snowfall . That means a big annual snowball fight with my brother :D 
Like this and I'll tell you what I've been holding back . A truth you should know . 
Send me a number -Digits- between 0-1000 through messages and I'll post something about you as my status . :D 
#2 (: You are the cutest ! haha . We truly need to talk more on here though . I love your smile , ah ! bottom line , you're cute (: haha . 
Keep sending those digits and I'll write about you as my statuss (: 
#901 <3 You are the most amazingest person ever . I love the fact that I met you and I can trust you . You are one of the bestest friends I have and I love you ! 
I would normally be asleep right now but I'm in heels and a dress in a party where my uncles are pretty much wasted and are the only ones having fun XD 
Feliz Cumpleaños mi < PROPFEMALE > María ! 
So for me sweet sixteen , I think I should invite people from YLC (: 
I like how you still think I care (: 
Being with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > is fkn boring ... 
So I'm bored . Why don't you ask me a question and I'll reply honestly ? Yeah , I think that'll help me right now , or it'll get my inbox full . Either way just do it :D 
\I'm smart . I've studied . I am confident . I will pass those exams because I'm just that awesome . so you know what exams ? I'll take your challenge and I'll beat you ! \"" 
It's funny how you keep believing the smile on my face (: 
The perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon . :D 
So looks like next Wednesday is Blankita and < PROPFIRST > day <3 Finally ! 
So I just saw < PROPFEMALE > Claus in a beat-up car that can't go past 50 mph . and I rolled down the window asking for that laptop I've been wanting (: 
Feliz Navidad everyone ! <3 I wish you all the best and I hope you spend it well with your loved ones . I know I am (: 
I love how I'm not sleepy , how mi tio me dio el regalo que queria , Y que la fiesta continua ... :D Ah my family <3 
Oh God . It's done . they are totally wasted . XD 
Only a few people are leaving and the party continues ... 
2010 is coming to an end ... like this and I'll tell you what we should do in 2011 (: 
In the train heading home with Blankita (: 
Like this and before 2010 ends I wanted to tell you ... along with a good memory we had this year :D 
( Like it ) Before 2010 ends ... I want you to know ... 
I'm happy I have my bangs again :D 
Man , I can't wait for tomorrow (: I'm so excited ! And I can't believe my grades , I'm proud ! 
It's amazing how you can look someone straight in their eyes and completely lie to them . Funny thing is , they know you're lying . 
So I just finished watching the Lion < PROPMALE > with my family and now I'm coloring in my coloring book with 64 crayons (: Oh yeah , this brings back memories . 
My favorite color is < PROPFEMALE > Idgaf < PROPFEMALE > (:

9 . Have I ever had a dream with you in it ? 
I love how I'm really tired and I can't fall asleep . >.< Who wants to tell me a bedtime story ? 
I love how you make my day (: 
Don't get upset when I don't say hi first . Don't tell me that I don't talk anymore because it was you who stopped first . There's facebook , you have my number for once how about you say Hi first ?

Are you cute ? \ 
Can you dress ? \ 
Do i see you in my future ? \ 
Do i love you ? \ 
Should we chill ? \ 
Would i kiss you ? \

First impression ? 
Ah , < PROPFIRST>'s Day is in a month ;D 
Bulls <3 
And the bulls win baby (: Oh yeah <3 
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop ? XD I got up to 103 ;D 
I am so looking forward to having my aunts come from spain . My sweetsixteen is probably gonna rock , especially if the NHI-ers come ;D 
Like and I'll answer ... \ 
What I think : I love : I like : I wish : I know : and I admit . 
Only thing surviving me through this day is going to the Bulls Game <3 
\I'll talk to you later\ " used to mean that \ " I'll talk to you tomorrow or the second I'm free . \ " Now it means . \ " I won't call you until I feel like it or until I have nothing better to do . \"" 
Half days feel good . Just relax ... and enjoy (: 
Like and I'll describe you in one word . 
To avoid disappointment , don't expect anything from anyone . 
1st to like : I'll have your last name for a day . \ 
2nd to like : I'll write on your wall for a week . \ 
3rd to like : I'll write \I love you\ " on your wall . \ 
So yesterday I was freezing half-to-death . Today I have this massive headache ! Oh yeah , this is gonna be a good weekend . XD 
Is it possible to be this bored ? 
Man , < PROPMALE > doesn't like my last name >.< 
I need something to help me go to sleep happy ... someone have a bedtime story ? 
Who's gonna watch the game ? 
Wow . :/ 
Finally a touchdown ! ' Bout time ! 
C'mon! there is still hope ! 
No words can decribe my disappointment .... except one , but I will not cuss . 
Idgaf ... Chicago is still the best city , it's my city and I will always be a fan <3 
I have no idea why but I wanna play truth or dare XD 
In nights like these I wish that you were up so we could talk like we used to ... 
I hate how there is nothing to do here at work >.< 
Liking your status DOES NOT mean that I like you , fyi :D 
Truth is ... I'm not in a good mood and I have no < PROPFEMALE > . One wrong move and I'll either breakdown or punch you in the face . I'll probably do neither but I'm not a fkn happy camper right now ! 
Truth is ...? 
Today has been good :D 
Man , next Tuesday is the anniversery of my birth ... :/ 
So I get my math homework O: That's a first . I'm so fkn proud of myself :D 
The only problem between us is lack of communication . When you want to talk I'm all ear but otherwise we'll continue walking , no a single word and act like if we were complete strangers . 
It's funny how we can talk so easily on the phone , but as soon as we're around people in the hallway we don't even wave \hi\ " . We are complete strangers until the people leave . Why can't we remain the same even with people around ? " 
So detention tomorrow ? :/ 
Stupid detention ! D: 
<3 
Dark Knight never gets old . A good way to spend my Friday Night , relaxing . 
I love the Cristo < PROPMALE > guys but tomorrow we all know Juarez got it (: 
I always say that you've changed but maybe , just maybe , I was the one who changed . I grew-up and you remained a child . 
I swear , if < PROPMALE > dies , I might break my TV and boycot Degrassi because ugh .! He's too cute to die ! 
I love how my family celebrates my birthday :D \ 
Dumping my head in the whole effin cake ! 
Half a decade and I can't ever forget < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s birthday (: 
So who wants to come over on Saturday ? Anyone ...? 
Damn , best birthday ever (: Got out of work early and no school tomorrow :D Egben and me are lucky . 
I pretty much want to thank everyone who wished me a happy birthday and just made me smile . <3 
I'm putting the snow into good use . Burying my brother in it is so much fun :D 
Do we have school tomorrow ? 
[ Like)Would I make you my valentine ? \ 
Would I marry you on Facebook ? \ 
Word to describe you using the first letter of your name ? \ 
Would I hug you ? \ 
Do I like your default ? \ 
Have I seen you in person ? \ 
Would I text you if I had your number ? \ 
Last time I saw you ? \ 
Truth is ? \ 
Do I love you ? 
Communication takes two . So don't complain if I don't talk because if you aren't going to put effort why should I ? 
Like and I'll write a good memory we have :D 
The Little Mermaid <3 
Navy pier monday ? :D 
Q & A ? ( inbox ) 
By now , we should know who's gonna win :D 
Packers :D \ 
Who saw this coming ? 
Navy pier was awesome :D the bus ride back is full of hyper teens and girls who found thier \boyfriend\ " today during the play ;D " 
I love how there are three of us on a liking spree :D 
I want to talk to someone I rarely communicate with :D 
I love you , < PROPFEMALE > Garcia <3 
Bed time story , yes ? 
Bored , now that I watched the new episodes to Degrassi <3 Soo ... \ 
I must admit ? 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day <3 A good day to watch Angus , thongs and perfect Snogging (: \ 
In honor of < PROPFIRST>'s Day , like and I'll write what I love about you ! 
I needed this half-day . Time to rest . 
When you have a lack of sleep it's bound to get to you . Point being I <3 El Doctorado . Rakim y Ken-y con < PROPFIRST > Dize (: equals beast song . 
Why is everyone so gloomy ? 
Pitbull <3 
Ay , mis tres novios <3 Chino , Nacho y < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . All of them deserved it but Chino y Nacho got it (: 
You're like the missing piece of a puzzle . Without it , it's incomplete . 
Man , I need to do something today ! I'm bored D: 
\I wrote your name on a piece of paper 
Family(n . ) ( adj . )\ 
- Reason why you are partial insane ; Reason why you can't let friends come over ; The reason why you're never alone ; friends ; supporters ; guides ; and lastly , they are the reason on who you are today . 
I'm bored . So like and I'll write something nice on your wall . 
\And I'm not forced to love you . I CHOOSE to love you . \ " -Another corny thing learned today . " 
Beauty attracts , but personality keeps <3 
\I was one to the world . But my dream was to be the world to one . \"" 
Are you living or are you existing ? 
Blasphemous :D 
Confessions ? 
When you think the night has seen your mind That inside you're twisted and unkind , Let me stand to show that you are blind . Please put down your hands ' cause I see you . I'll be your mirror . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Love is too powerful to hide for very long . Deny it and suffer the consequences . Acknowledge it and suffer the consequences . Revealing it can either be shameful or it can be liberating . It is for others to decide which it shall be . 
Sore but it's worth it . 
Touchball is softball in my Madrina's language . 
The first time the party actually gets good and I'm not there . Fk .! 
I loved feeding < PROPMALE > like at 6:30 in the morning . :D I miss that little babyboy (: 
Skype , anyone ? 
Bored . I'mma do the same as < PROPMALE > Corral . \ 
For every like , I'll write a confession . 
Confession #1 : I never like saying a nice thing about me because either I don't believe it or I feel too conceited . 
Confession #2 : I don't trust easily but I don't like being alone . 
Confession #3 : I still have the bear my uncle gave me when I was five . I can't sleep anywhere else without it . 
Confession #4 : I love it when people make me smile or laugh when I'm done . I feel like they care and I feel loved :D -chessy but true . 
Confession #5 : I really think I'm going to cry ( a bit ) this graduation . 
Confession #6 : I believe I'm smart but I'm uber lazy and that's what keeps me from straight A's . 
Confession #7 : I sometimes love my hectic schedule . I like being busy instead of being bored at home doing nothing . 
Confession #8 : I want to make a difference by doing what I'm good at and what I love . And it will happen . Trust me . 
Confession #9 : It takes me awhile to get mad depending on the situation but I forgive either too fast or too easily .
