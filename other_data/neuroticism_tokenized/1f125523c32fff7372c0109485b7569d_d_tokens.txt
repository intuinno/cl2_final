Borrowed : < PROPFEMALE > wants to know HOW DID WE MEET ? Everyone play the game ! Copy and paste this phrase on your profile , you will find it amusing to see how you met and know each of your friends !!

needs some of Mommy's wisdom 
does not understand why the heater is on high when it's 59 frickin degrees outside ... this is worse than not having A/C in the summertime , it's like < PROPFEMALE > WANTS me to die of heat stroke 
' s room is finally at a livable temperature , yay !... now if only i could turn off the drama , sigh ... 
y are there dudes on my floor ?!! y are there cops in my dorm ?!!!! WHY IS < PROPFEMALE > ON LOCKDOWN ?!!!! Daddy i think i need you to come down here !!!! 
ummm false alarm maybe ... all i know is i just got my room inspected by students from the < PROPFIRST>'s office at 12:19 a.m. , but i don't even know ... my thinking face is on ! 
so one of the downsides to a college campus is that you have to walk around outside to get all of your classes , which really wouldn't be so bad except for when you live on a waterfront campus during the hurricane season ... did I mention the lack of drain pipes ? 
HURRICANE AAAHHHH !!!!!! This campus has been shut down ! 
so after Mother Nature tried to blow kids of campus and then drown it , Hampton is playin like we're gonna have school tomorow ... but come on Dr. < PROPMALE > , you know you just wanna turn this into a four day weekend :) 
wow God is truly great and He is an awesome teacher ! Even in the midst of the storm ( literally ) He keeps me safe from harm and even throws in a couple of undeserved blessings . Now my test has been moved from today to Monday and my 20+ < PROPFEMALE > paper can be turned in next Friday ... whoever said Friday the 13th is unlucky/cursed needs to get to know Jesus because when I count my blessings I know that I am in His favor ! Amen
