While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make your woman CRY , there's a man stealing her smile . Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic violence .

If a guy loves you he will prove it , he will be with you throughout your life , and he will try to be with you , and if he has a reason why he can not he will still try to make it happen . Guys need to learn that girls are not out to get them ... All girls just want happiness .

The One u just called fat She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The One you just called stupid ? She has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The One you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The One you just tripped ? She is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying .

All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's butt . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
I do not know what to do anymore . I can not help my best friend , and it sucks . 
I sit here thinking about life\ 
I know it is tough and rough , \ 
But I know that good lies within it . \ 
There is something missing , \ 
but it will be found with time . \ 
The time is ticking away . \ 
Do not let one more day , \ 
Slip away .
