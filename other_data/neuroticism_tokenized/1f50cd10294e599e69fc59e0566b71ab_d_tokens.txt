Great start to the Cross Country season for Zach . Got a PR on the Fork Union course , won a medal and the weather was gorgeous . 

' s Facebook was highjacked by Christian Snider . Oh you silly tech noons need to learn to logout . 
Headed to lexington for zachs cc meet . Too many UVA wahoos on the road headed to the game making for a tricky ride . 
Just finished my leg of driving to NYC . Now the crazyman driver takes the wheel . I'm hanging onto my hat ! 
Thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes ! I did my usual day off from work :) and trip to Williamsburg to shop and eat with my sweetie . We had a wonderfully relaxing time . 
Change your profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday , December 6 , 2010 there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of positive childhood memories . This is for violence against children !
