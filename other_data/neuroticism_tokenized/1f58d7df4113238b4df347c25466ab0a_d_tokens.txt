Cellphones look cool in the dark , the whole stadium looked like it was filled with stars :D . Also that holding penalty was bullcrap , the Giants should have gotten that one :P . 
I'm going to see Deathly Hallows in Imax tonight :D ! 
Happy Thanksgiving ! And due to something I recently saw , I hope you enjoy your eel :D .

Absinthe is delicious ... 
My whole life I thought \clandestine\ " meant \ " pure\ " thanks for the wakeup call Dictionary.com . It just sounded like a \ " good\ " word ok ? " 
This little dog that pops up while watching AS is freaking me out O_O .
