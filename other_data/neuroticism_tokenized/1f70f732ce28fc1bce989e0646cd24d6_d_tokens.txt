I also really like liberate by disturbed , but i can't sing that one cause every time i swear at home i owe my mom $1 XD 
I need to lay off the crack ( mountain dew voltage ) cause the withdrawal headache over the weekend is horrific . good lord . owwwww ~

Sudden Realization : all of my favorite female vocalists ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Simons , and < PROPFEMALE > Peters for rock/pop , classical , and broadway style singing respectively ) are red heads . Somewhere in my soul I always knew that red hair was epic , and if the \

hey , I really need help . could all of you out there who believe in God pray that my parents let me stay in running start ? I don't want to answer a lot of questions on this thread . I'm to tired and scared . But prayers would be greatly appreciated . 
Thank you everyone for your prayers . I am still in running start ! However , as is to be expected , I will not be able to really use the computer for the forseeable future , nor will I be able to e-text or use dad's phone . This means that if you want to reach me you will have to * gasp * go back to the days of voice communication and call me on the house phone ! DOOMZ ! 
Thanks everyone for the happy birthdays ! I have a cold , but I'm almost over it and i look forward to seeing all my family very soon ! Love you all ~ 
it was lady's night and we all went to an AMAZING steak house . God I love my family . I just ate my own weight in meat . life is good .

had an awesome time hanging out with everyone this weekend ! Oh , and apparently the people at the church would like me to sing a solo or something ? XD any ideas for a song ? I mean , I could always pull out Ave < PROPFIRST > , but 1 ) It's rather overdone and 2 ) I run the risk of shattering the beautiful stained glass windows ' cause if I sing that song I'm gonna sing it in the highest octave and key that I possibly can :D 
so I just picked up some more red hair dye since the red I had before has almost completely faded . now I just need somewhere I can go use it . a curse on my mother's headaches ! at least I can use nail polish without it bothering her so much now . 
bacon wrapped shrip that has been dipped in cheese , i think it's havarti cheese . OH MAH GEEZUS THIS STUFF IS MAGICAL OM NOM NOM NOM

Finally actually completed a set of lyrics that I'm pleased with . Yay . * is proud of self *
