WTF ?! < PROPMALE > screws a nun . This ruins all my plans for < PROPMALE > /Ciel fanfiction . Unless .... Hmm ... [ rubs hands together ] Bisexual . 
Amongst a many complinments , one rude comment can ruin your day ... 
I love you and all , but learn to keep your mouth shut . You just keep going , and going , and going ... you’re making a bad impression ! Oh well , the con was fun anyway .... 
Just fiunished Kuroshitsuji ( Black Butler ) . \ 
I cried . 
Jeeaz . I mention to my mom about the < PROPFEMALE > Panel at Kajonk-a-con , and goes beserk . I KNOW I told you about this . It's not that you don't remember- It's that you don't care until it meses with your plans ! 
The one day I don't get $100 for my birthday ... is the one year I really need it .

Pimple on my chin : Please , please go away ... 
Not trying to sound like an advertisement or anything here , but I just lost 10lbs on Weight Watchers ^_^ 
Does your anime have card games ? Alternate realities ? Time travel ? Robots ? Mine does ! Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds ! LOL !

My best friend is moving away ... :( 
Got back from driving lessons ... 
\He dies . \ " \

Just got 50+ messages in my Gmail inbox from you guys tagging stuff at 1AM in the moring :P GO TO BED ! Thank God I thought to check my inbox before morning , or I would have 150+ messages ! 
So what ? You’re allowed to leave the radio and the TV on all the time , but if I leave the refrigerator door open for more than 5 seconds , you go batshit crazy about how I’m wasting energy ? Sure , Dad , sure ... 
So , apparently my best friend’s marijuana-dealing cousin wants my number , even when she lied and said that I am fatter than a house with a face as ugly as a cow . Eww . 
Why does that awesome sounding song from the Suckerpunch trailer have to be about crablouses ? SERIOUSLY ?! It's sounds so good , until you hear the lyrics ... 
might be getting out of Photography and Marketing this year and trading them in for two classes with Mrs. Woody so I can have homework time 
Your pep-talks make me feel worse about myself . 
is convinced Mom doesn’t want her to get that < PROPFEMALE > dress . Stuff that was free before now costs money . I think she’s trying to drain me of my cash reserves . 
I want to know where those lolis who find loli-able stuff in thirft sotres are going , because when I go to thrift sotres , I find ABSOLUTLY NOTHING :/ 
Having chats with , like , five people at once is overwhelming ... 
Current nail color : \Got The Blues For Red\ " \ 
ARGH ! Stupid viruses ! I got rid of you , I thought or relationship was over , but nooooo , you had to go and corrupt half my music files and mess with my programs ! All my Emilei Autumn ! GONE ! FML !!! 
\You're going to wear a Little < PROPMALE > Peep outfit to school ? \ " \ 
Well , if Mom hadn't cheated me out fo $50 , I'd be wearing a wonderful new < PROPFEMALE > dress to school tomorrow , but nooooo ... :/ 
Dear people who start at me in the hallways , guess what ? I don't care . 
Where the @#$% is < PROPFIRST > Thompson ? He hasn't come to school , his cell's turned off ... What the hell ? 
Jayla Price is in my 3rd period . Fell free to start placing bets ion when I’m going to slap/punch/maul her . ( Because I don’t plan to , and then I’ll get all the money ! Ha ! ) 
This series keeps killing my favorite characters ! I hope they bring him back to life too ... Damn you , Kuroshitsuji ! 
So ... my dad just bought me some books . They're suggested by < PROPFEMALE > MEYER , author of TWILIGHT D: \ 
That alone makes me not want to read them . 
You start to value life more once you realize you almost lost yours . 
I swear , I just keep making enemies on the interwebs ... I guess that’s what I get for speaking my mind . 
WOW ! Just posted and edited entries in about 5 places ( communities , forums ) for the 2010 KAC < PROPFEMALE > panel in under 30 minutes ! My fingers are SO tired ! 
I'm going to be honest , I nearly peed my pants in theater today laughing . Anyone else ? 
Cussing out kids at the Apple Store at West Town Mall :) 
Well , @#$% . \ 
My computer is giving me the blue screen of disc check on reboot . \ 
That's NEVER a good sign . 
Have you ever worried that you’re going to fail in life ? Like , never be able to live independently ; always relying on people . With all his pressure to go to college , I feel like I won’t have the determination to grow up ... I have all these many dreams , and don’t know how to achieve them 
I can't sleep , I'm burning up , my throat is raw , and my nose is runny . First sickness of the season , here I come ! :P 
is STILL sick . God , this is horrible . 
I don't want to grow up . Seriously . Take me to Neverland . Like , NOW . 
\*points to once of the costume closet's dresses * I feel like I'm part of a different religion . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Singletary " 
Why does everyone assume I listen to opera ? I listen to industrial and metal ! Jeez ! 
So apparently , I fail at driving , I have to drive home from school the rest of the year despite this , and my computer can’t play YouTube videos . End of the world ? Yes , I think it is . 
is wanting to smash her head against a wall :/ 
If I made her cry , or even just feel bad , I could never forgive myself ... 
I think I missed the day to order my graduation cap and gown when I was sick once . Did I ? If not , does anyone know what the next date for ordering is ? 
spent most of her 4th period cleaning up other people's shit . WTF ? 
can't wait until this Saturday ! Can you say ' Halloween shopping' ?! :D 
Just got my costume ! Mom and dad took me out tonight after my doctor appointment to Halloween Express . I'm a sailor for this Halloween !

Play with my heart\ 
Don’t play with my heart\ 
You did it from the start\ 
You're perfect\ 
And perfectly humble about it\ 
Quite the gentleman 
Yeah , my last status was song lyrics written by me . I'm feeling really contemplative right now . 
ZOMBIES . YES .

When I run away , all it means is that I want someone to find me . 
Start tagging ladies and gents ! I have my inbox prepared this time around :) \ 
And I'm already working on a cool video ! \ 
The songs I want to use are ' Dead is the New Alive ' by < PROPFEMALE > Autumn , ' Thriller ' by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and ' Make Me Want to Die ' by The Pretty Reckless . \ 
Any more you guys can think of that would be appropriate ? 
Hero Vs . Villians Day should totally just be Character Day or whatever , like last year . Now , I can't do anything :/ Sorry , Adv . Theatre , I just lowered your percentage a little bit ... 
So , apparently there's a rumor going around that I'm mentally retarded ? How unoriginal . I had to deal with that rumor in Sophmore year :/ 
Wearing Kuro < PROPFEMALE > today , with my ORANGE nails . See- I got school spirit ! :P \ 
I just hope Mrs. Pressley doesn't change our cooking date to today ... Or else I'll get food all over my clothes ! D: 
Nutella for breakfast <3 
Just a notice for my loli-freinds who were planning to go to the Kajonk-A-Con < PROPFEMALE > Panel ... There's a rumor going around that the con has been cancelled . Now , it's just a RUMOR , but I thought those who became friends with me because of Kajoink-a-con should know . I'm trying to squeeze details out of some people about the subject , currently . 
* sigh * I'm screwed ... 
You make me want hurt myself instead of making myself feel better . \ 
You mock me when I want to be comforted . \ 
You hurt me when I want to be healed . \ 
You’re my parents . \ 
You’re not supposed to do this . 
So ... I have three choices now :\ 
1 ) Live my life in misery\ 
2 ) Run away\ 
3 ) Kill myself\ 
The second and third ones are looking like good options . 
Updates :\ 
1 ) Not feeling psycho anymore\ 
2 ) Was suspended - that's why I was gone\ 
3 ) Got my computer back after having it taken away during suspension\ 
4 ) Will be back Monday 
is thinking about not doing the work I was assigned for suspension and fall break . Mom said I am going to fail at life with the way I am going , so why even try ? 
Anyone want to metet up in Broadacres and go trick-or-treating on Halloween ? We could get SO MUCH < PROPFEMALE > there ... * is a fat kid *

Not taking that < PROPFEMALE > . It is staying in Bean Station . Coming back home . 
According to UPS , my dress should be here tomorrow or the next day . I'm keeping my expectations low- I could be reading it wrong , but oh , what if it's right ? Ah ! I can't wait ! 
Who would cry for me if I killed myself ? Not the one I love most ... 
GOT MY DRESS !!! it's a little big and needs to be altered , so I won't be wearing it to school tomorrow , probably . But better big than small when it comes to alterations , right ?

I don't care what you say , Pikachu ! Sebastian totally counts for the \Pokemon Profile Picture for DECEMBER 2010\ " and \ " Remember Remember the Pokemon December\ " events . " 
What's with this fad of putting a picture of your eye as a profile picture ?! If you add me , and I don't recognize your name , how the hell am I supposed to know who you are ?! 
In response to this whole \CHANGE BACK YOUR PICTURE\ " thing ... \ 
Holy baloney ! International < PROPFEMALE > Day just flew right past me ! How could this happen ?!

is writing crossover fanfiction ( Nabari no Ou x Yugioh : Miharu x < PROPMALE > ) instead of doing her autobiography ... Whoops ! >_> 
Half-assed my autobiogtraphy . 19 pages out of 45 . Hey , at least I'm turning it in . I usually don't do that . \ 
I better get bonus points for my kick-ass cover though . 
iIs officially traumatized thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Singletary

Oh crap . Lost it . Inspiration . GONE . DEAD . \ 
Writer's Block , here I come .

Grell Sutcliff is my anti-drug <3 
Rented and watched Inception . DAMN , I wish I could have seen that movie in theaters . Would have been even cooler . 
Is thinking about selling most of my YuGiOh manga ... 
Thanks ABC . < PROPFIRST > and the Chocolate Factory ? Now I know the world's taunting me . 
Downloaded the leaked ' Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt ' sountrack . Calling me happy would be an understatement . 
Had a real strange dream ... It ran like a MMORPG and American McGee's < PROPFEMALE > put together . There was bogs you had to navigate and haunted mansions with roller coasters running through them , and you had to shoot ghosts from your sea , And if you die ? You turn into a ghost and have to play for the opposite team . \ 
It was pretty damn awesome . \ 
Of course my ' character ' died in the second level to a giant moth ghost :P 
My dog ( < PROPFEMALE > , not the one that walks sideways ) is such a dumbass . I give her a bagel chip and she tries to eat the whole damn thing instead of breaking it in half . Then she goes and buries it outside . 
~ Randomly ~ ordered a Ciel Phantomhive wig . I'll use it . I swear ! > ( 
Watched ' Devil ' . Wasn't too bad , considering the story was by M Night . Shyamalanadingdong . 
You are my friend and all , but please , PLEASE do not sing to my songs ! You CAN NOT sing , and you ruin the song for me ! 
I am going to be honest ... All of the prom dresses I am seeing in magazines disgust me . 
Don't drink & drive , and don't ride with anybody who does . \

Recieved Bizenghast Vol . 7 and DOLL Vol . 4 in the mail from Borders ! Yay ! 
Is anyone from Powell interested in my xxxHolic Vol . 1 DVD ? It's in perfect condition , but for some reason , McKay's wouldn't take it ... I'm selling it for $10 . 
DOLL Vol . 4 : This is EPIC . 
My Ciel wig was just shipped :D 
I actually WANT there to be school tomorrow . I hate having nothing to do , and I miss my friends :( 
Does anyone actually read my statuses ? \ 
Really ? \ 
THEN WHY DO YOU NEVER F-ING COMMENT ON THEM ? 
Okay , so I get up this early to prepare for school , and it seems school is one hour late . Oh well , may as well get dressed . < PROPFEMALE > today ! 
I think I'm going to start wearing more wigs now . They're comfortable , stylish and fun <3 
Mom doesn't want me in public wearing that wig . She doesn't want me to go out in public wearing < PROPFEMALE > either . Maybe I should just go naked and shave my head ? \ 
What ever happened to individuality , Mom ? 
So ... school tomorrow ? Or have they just not announced it's closed yet ? ( I'm all confused ... ) 
Yay for < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim books coming in today ! * read read read * 
Dude . That was like , a 4 hour nap . That's a record . 
You know what ? I'm not even going to bother telling you what's going on in my life or the life of my friends anymore because you never take it seriously . 
I got the Black Butler Limited Edition DVD !!! I had a spazz attack when i opened the package . We need to start planning for a party . How about Saturday ? 
OMG ! Grell's reaper voice is LOVE !!! 
Changed the time of the party to 5:30 , just because the list of movies is getting longer . You can come any time though ! 
What do you all want for food at the party ? What kind of chips , soda , etc ...? 
I have come to the conclusion that my parents are terribly uniformed about tomorrow's party . 
JUST finished cleaning up everything in the house for the party . I think is started at ... 9:00 PM ? 
Totally just spent over $50 on food for the party , and STILL didn't get as much as I would have liked . Damn you , inflation ! 
I realized I forgot to mention it , but no drugs , alcohol , cigarettes , or weapons at my party ! ( I'm allergic to cigarettes , believe it or not . The rest are obvious , and YES , I will ask , and check you if I feel suspicious ) . 
Gonna be honest , last night was awesome ! \ 
We need to hold another party next month or so . 
This is ... awkward . 
ARGH . I cant seem to get Kelby or < PROPFIRST > off my back . No means NO . 
God , I hope that's over ... 
has resigned to the fact that she will never get her theater assignment done . 
Sorry , Ms. Doubleday . 
Might have to pull a all-nighter on the rest of my theater project . How pathetic . 
Taking a shower , then going to bed . \ 
I'm might wear < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . MIGHT . 
I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU 
Blocked my mom from my FB . She's a judgemental bitch , anyway . 
Mom will only buy my prom dress if I lose 20lbs . What a bitch ! I mean , seriously , doesn't she know that people can only lose weight if they set their mind to it and actually want to ? I don't want to lose weight ! I'm okay with myself ! She’s the one who has a problem with how I look , not me . How pathetic , she's embarrassed by her own daughter ! 
Has things to deliever tomorrow : An ass-load of Naruto plushies for < PROPFEMALE > Napier and Confindetial Conffesions : DEAI for < PROPFEMALE > Cosby . \ 
My purse is going to be stuffed ... 
Gonna be honest , this year's Super Bowl commercials SUCKED . I didn't laugh one bit , and none of them stick out in my mind as being the least bit memorable . 
Am I the only person at Powell who hasn't tried to snort Fun Dip ? 
Just had my Gmail account hacked . \ 
The hacker sent out ads for Viagra to my freinds and family . \ 
I got my account back , but still ... :/

1 hour and 15 minutes to upload a 7 minute video ? C'mon Facebook . Youtube could do that in 10 minutes . 
So it seems our videos are too awesome for Facebook AND Youtube . Thanks interwebs . Sorry , < PROPFEMALE > Hannifin :( 
So , < PROPFEMALE > Cosby's doughnuts I was suppossed to deliver got eaten without my knowledge . By my Dad . Who was trying to save me from diabetes . When he has diabettes . I SENSE FLAWED REASONING .
