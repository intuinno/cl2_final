Up until now , I swore to myself that I'm content with lonliness ... 

I give up , you win . You win , cause I'm not counting . 
I loveeeeee < PROPFEMALE > :D 
Sunburned a little ... I love how the scent of chlorine still lingers .... 
Just 4 more days til I'm back in Satan's lair ... a . k . a < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Look at us break our bonds in this kitchen Look at us rallying all our defenses Look at us waging war in our bedroom . Look at us jumping ship in our dialogs . 
I missed your skin when you were east . You clicked your heels and wished for me ... 
Yo quisiera amarla como usted se lo merece y no puedo aunque quiero , no me sa < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > pecho lo intento y me freno y la cobar < PROPFEMALE > por no herirla me mantuvo en si < PROPFEMALE > ncio .... lo siento . Yo < PROPFEMALE > pido no me odie bien acepto sus reproches < PROPMALE > fin < PROPMALE > ya yo sabía que este < PROPFEMALE > l < PROPFEMALE > garia y estoy muy convencido usted sería el mejor partido . 
Sing me to sleep , sing me to sleep . I don't want to wake up on my own anymore . Sing me to sleep ... sing to me . Can't sleep ... 
What would it take , for things to be quiet . Quiet like the snow . I know , this isn't much , but I know I could , I could be better . I don't think I deserve it , selflessness . Find your way into my heart , all stars could be brighter , all hearts could be warmer 
You're a wasted face . You're a sad-eyed lie . You're a .... holocaust . I can taste the failure on your lips . 
Went with < PROPFEMALE > to Farm Fresh , then her house , now the movies .... great way to start the day lol 
Just got done having breakfast with Conor and < PROPMALE > :) 
Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? 
Him : You're a whiny , narcissistic bitch . \ 
Me : Excuse me ?! Narcissistic ! \ 
Him : I don't even know what that means , I'm sorry !!!!! 
tired of looking far and wide for tamarind paste , only to find nothing .... damn grocery stores , especially farm fresh because they had nothing we needed except a serrano pepper , and when we got to the counter she said , \this is a jala-pino right ? \ " it's pronouned hala pen yo you idiot .... " 
Omnipotence 
I got a mouth like a sailor , and yours ... is more like a Hallmark card ... 
the water's warm and children swim , and we frolicked about in our summer skin 
i want to be big and let go this grudge thats grown old , i want to be soft and resolved . 
I've been considering words that start with the letter \o\ " ... quite ostentatious really ... " 
i hope you smile , if i ever cross your mind , it was a pleasure of my life , and i cherished everytime , and my whole world , it begins and ends with you .... 
Colored outside the lines today ...

Every rule has an exception . I found that exception . 
Craigsamus is my smelly socks in the back of your mom's car who carries avocados in his pockets and has special nights :)

Regardless of warnings , the future doesn't scare me at all . 
I see me through your eyes ...

that we'll have each other's backs , cause we're that lucky\ 
together , we move mountains , let's not make mountains out of molehills , \ 
you hit me twice , yeah , but who's counting ? \ 
I may have hit you three times , but I'm starting to lose count . 
If I could , I would always work in silence and obscurity , and let my efforts be known by their results .
