Stupid holidays ...

So beyond bored 
In darkness , even the most light hearted despair . Despair no longer , for the light is coming , and shall relieve you of your pain . I swear it . 
The Knight In Shining Armor , Forever More Stands Tall , Ready To Protect Those He Cares For 
Why does everything have to hurt so much ? 
I hate this not knowing , Pain's constant growing , and everything comes to it's end . My life so chaotic , and oft so distraught , and all I seek is a friend . 
is out of food !!! GRRR !!! 
Seven times Seven , And Angels Speak , of Darkness to come , and Love to Seek . O.o Wierd crap comes into my head sometimes ... 
* Yawns * Boredness ... 
Darkness leads my heart astray , Nobody cares for me , So hear me now as I say , I won't see another day . I was left here all alone , Sorrow bound my heart to stone , Nobody came so here it shown , In the ground my drying blood is sewn . 
* Jumps off a < PROPMALE > * 
* Feels Better Now * 
Chaos borne of darkness strong , while sorrow sings a broken song . 
STEP 1 : GO TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FACEBOOK < PROPFEMALE > . STEP 2 : CLICK ON '' ENGLISH US '' STEP 3 : WHEN ALL THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES APEAR , CLICK ON ENGLISH ( PIRATE ) ... very funny ... COPY AND PASTE THIS INFO AND PUT IT AS YOUR STATUS 
Jumping off a < PROPMALE > sounds like fun right now ... Strangeness 
Foooood !!! I need foood ! We have nothing to eat ! * Steals people's food * 
Ok , fed , now I just need to get rid of my boredom and I'll be set for the day 
Ugh .... So freaking exhausted ... I just spent the last hour and a half chasing chickens ... I soooo need a shower -.- 
Ugh ... can't sleep even ... 
Just got up and already extremely depressed ... 
Wants to die ... 
Ow . Been up for the last two hours . My shouler feels like it's going to implode upon itself . I'm exhausted . And I am extremely tired of these damn nightmares . 
Yay for school registration * Gag * Ahwell , has to be done some time I suppose ... 
Why is it that every time I see you , I feel my heart break just a little more ? Every single heartbeat is shattered a thousand times , And I wonder why it is , you can't be mine . I am lost without a cause , My life has no reason . I am broken can't you see ? Left alone for so long . There is nothing I can say , My life'll be gone tomorrow . And at last I'll be free , From the pain and the sorrow . 
I don't even know ... :( 
Ugh ... Edit last one ; Sick , cold and have a headache 
I feel a cold chill , Runnin up my spine , Takin ' away my pain , Destroying my mind . I haven't got a thing Left to me now , I'm on the brink , But I don't know how . I've lost it , All things said and done , I'm all alone , I've seen my last setting sun . 
Miserably depressed ... Stupid life ... 
Ow . My back is killing me -.- My head is killing me . Fell down the stairs this morning , Oh , and my depression is kicking in again , go me ! Life sucks . 
So don't want to go to school ... 
Prediction was accurate . School sucked . Yay life ! * Jumps off a bridge * 
So needing a new mattress -.- 
Every night now when I sleep , I wake to find my eyes do weep , For nightmares follow in my mind , Peace and love I'll never find . 
So not diggin ' today at all 
Hope everythings ok , I really don't want to lose you 
( I wish it was you ) The phone ring in the middle of the night The doorbell in the broad daylight A letter in the mail that I come home to ( I wish it was you ) When I see two people on the street Touchin ' like they don't care who sees Laughin ' the way we used to do I wish it was me and I wish it was you I wish it was me and I wish it was you 
Wow , did I mess up that bad ? 
Been thinking about rain for the last few days , dunno why , but I wish it would do so soon . 
So tired of never knowing what I'm doing with my life ... 
They say freak , When you're singled out , The red , well it filters through . So lay down , the threat is real , When his sight goes red again . 
Dunno what's going on , I do know that I want to sleep , but I don't know what's going on still . 
Gonna stand my ground , won't be turned around And I'll keep this world from draggin ' me down Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down 
I look through the mirror And all that I see Is one crazy lonely sucker looking back at me I'm sitting here thinkin ' Sittin ' here drinkin bout you 
I don't even know , what it is I've done . No where to go , I've got no where to run . All I have is my heart , and it breaks more everyday . No way to restart , so tonight I'll pray . 
Sick ... 
Really hope everything turns out ok ... I don't know what I'd do without you ... 
Oh can't you see that pretty little bird ? Singing with all his heart and soul . He's got a blood red spot on his wing , And all the rest of him's black as coal . 
THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic crcles will appear . The only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! Put this as your status if it works . :D Everybody knows I won't post these unless they work , honestly , this is trippy ! Thanks Em !!! 
Well , I passed the bloody test . Now onto more miserable things ! Woo ! * Gunshot goes off * -.- 
Is it raining ? Is it snowing ? Is a hurricane a-blowing ? Not a speck of light is showing , So the danger must be growing . Are the fires of Hell a-glowing ? Is the grisly reaper mowing ? Yes , the danger must be growing , For the rowers keep on rowing , And they're certainly not showing , Any signs that they are slowing ! 
I cannot feel my arms . Seriously . I just spent three hours digging a 4x3 6 foot hole in the ground . -.- 
Shadows wander ' cross my mind , Often answers are so hard to find . But I must not give in , I must move on , I cannot falter , Must move towards the sun . So please don't surrender , I'll be there soon , I'll be there with you By the light of the < PROPFEMALE > . 
Eternity weighs down on me , Life lost in bittersweet sorrow , And evermore dominion weeps , The miseries of tomorrow . But happiness it must exist , For why else are we here ? No god's so cruel as that , To let us live in naught but fear . 
It's the blood that ties , It's the hurt that heals . It's the face you hide , Hide's the pain you feel . So hold me up now , Yeah , I'm afraid to breathe , And I'm lost to you . ~ Believe in Angels 
I hate cleaning with a passion . And now my room smells like burnt rubber . Stupid vacuum cleaner -.- 
\Another suitcase of scar shaped souvenirs \ 
Amazingly , not even the tortures of school can ruin my good mood ! * Happiness * 
Cleverbot.com Hours of entertainment 
I am at my blackened end , the path I follow is gone to me now , forever does eternity call for the broken ... 
So Cold ... 
Ze French accentz ! Ze are amuzing ! French Fail ! WOOOO !

When do shadows become what once was hope , and cast aside all free thoughts , replacing them with pain , and sorrow ? 
< PROPMALE > Stress . 
Ok ... well ... better than I expected I guess , now I've just got to prove myself . 
Misery , you know me , Can't you see Why I bleed ? Sorrow comes As my blood runs , My life is done , I'm finally ... Free ... 
When the light fades into darkness , When pain replaces joy , There'll be mis'ry for the selfless and sorrow unnavoid 
I hate when people ' forget ' -.- 
Suicide makes all blind And shatters all perceptions , Creative thoughts are all now lost , By creations great deception . ' Tis fate that is cruel and cast on man , For sin is his only choice . Damnation calls on mortal souls , Yet with such a melodious voice . Now hear the cry As mortals die , And in their graves do scream , And never ponder , wonder why , or just what it may mean . 
Welcome to the soldier side , Where there is no one here but me , People all grow up to die , There is no one here but me . 
* Sigh * 
B.O.O.M.M. 
A failure I am as born I was meant to be 
The dark nights to come , So kiss me for goodbye , The grace of the godland is near to you ... 
I never saw a sky so blue , Until I saw it , laying with you . And the cool air floating on the breeze , Makes me remember , What it is you mean to me . Well my love will never falter , My heart'll beat forever true , And no matter what , I'll always love you . 
* Sigh * I really wish I could get ahold of her ... 
I feel like I'm losing everything I hold dear to me ... 
Oh can't you see that pretty little bird ? Singing with all his heart and soul . He's got a blood red spot on his wing , And all the rest of him's black ... As Coal . Of all the colors I ever did see , Red and black are the ones I dread . For when a man spills blood on the coal , They'll < PROPFEMALE > him down from the coal mines ... dead . 
Welcome to the show the great finale's finally here I thank you for coming into my theatre of fear Welcome to the show , you're all witnesses you see A privileged invitation to the last rights of me The Great Misconceptions of Me - W.A.S.P. 
I should be sleeping , ' stead of keeping , These late hours I've been keeping , I've been pacing and retracing , Every step of every move , An even though I'm feeling so right , I'm so happy , still I know , I should be sleeping , ' stead of dreamin ' about you . 
An old man by a seashore , At the end of day , Gazes at the horizon , With seawinds in his face . Tempest tossed island , Seasons all the same , Anchorage unpainted , And a ship without a name 
Oh how I wish , \ 
For soothing rain , \ 
Oh how I wish to dream again , \ 
Once and for all , \ 
And all for once , \ 
Nemo my name for evermore . 
I am so not going to be sleeping tonight * Sigh * Hate life ... 
Nightmares walk my shattered mind , And lost in shadows no hope I find , For darkness comes and to the soul does bind , Ending all of my sanity's kind . 
Well he make his mistakes , And they weigh on his soul , But his alter is an open sky , A church where no one goes . And He knows God understands him , ' Cause he made him that way , Silently he makes his peace , That's just how a Cowboy prays ... 
Welcome to the show , The great finalle's finally here , I thank you all for coming into my theater of fear . Welcome to the show , You're all witnesses you see , A privelaged invitation to the last rights of me ... 
Hello misery , \ 
Hello pain , \ 
Hello sorrow , \ 
I'm home again . \ 
\ 
I was cast , \ 
From the gates of Hell . \ 
The darkened place , \ 
Where the angels fell . \ 
And there it was , \ 
My heart turned to lead . \ 
' Cause all I loved , \ 
I had found was dead . \ 
And now my pain , \ 
Has consumed my past , \ 
This song I sing , \ 
Will be my last . 
Death shall be my release . 
\Teach me passion 
Unloved , without a hope . The dead man you see is me . Forever cast from my life , Drowning in pain for eternity . 
\I'll be here alone \ 
Heaven called me forward , \ 
While I was looking back . \ 
Trying to see who it would be , \ 
To save me from my past . \ 
I am a lost soul , \ 
Cursed to wander evermore , \ 
' Til Judgement comes\ 
To set the score . \ 
Patiently I hope and pray , \ 
That God will set me free one day , \ 
And everything we dream will come true , \ 
But above all , I hope they all come true for you . 
\It's sad to say that \ 
Thank you everybody who wished me a happy birthday ! It was better than I had expected 
AWESOMESAUCE !!!!!! 
Gravedigger , When you dig my grave , Would you make it shallow , So I can feel the rain . Gravedigger . 
So glad to have who I do in my extra family , you guys rock ! 
I would do anything for love , \ 
I'd run right into hell and back . \ 
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact . 
\The curse of his powers tormented his life\ 
Well , let the sunshine or the rain come through , Let the river run it's course so true , If the skies be dark or be they blue , Just remember , I'll be waiting here for you . 
So ... anyone want to give me their oppinions on my first draft thing that I wrote ? 
Off to take care of the animalia , back shortly 
Shattered memories , \ 
Faded dreams . \ 
This corruption's , \ 
Not what it seems . \ 
Not a day goes by\ 
That I don't ask , \ 
Just how important , \ 
Is the past ? \ 
Nothing matters , \ 
Anymore . \ 
I had no one , \ 
To be there for . \ 
So I lie here , \ 
All alone . \ 
When your bodies cold . 
By the way , you left without\ 
Saying goodbye to me . \ 
Now that you're gone away , \ 
All I can think about is\ 
You and me , you and me . 
Has decided to watch Devil May Cry the anime before watching FML Brotherhood 
Doesn't understand why people always have to say Goodbye ... 
Very close to killing somebody right now . 
Das Wasser soll dein Spiegel sein\ 
erst wenn es glatt ist , wirst du sehen\ 
wieviel Märchen dir noch bleibt\ 
und um Erlösung wirst du flehen 
Trust I seek and I find in you\ 
Every day for us something new\ 
Open mind for a different view\ 
And nothing else matters 
Sleep calls for me . Darkness eternal . Bliss evermore . 
Nursery rhymes are said , verses in my head\ 
Into my childhood they're spoon fed\ 
Hidden violence revealed , darkness that seems real\ 
Look at the pages that cause all this evil 
Good mornin ' beautiful , \ 
How was your night ? \ 
Mine was wonderful , \ 
With you by my side ! \ 
And when I , open my eyes , \ 
And see your sweet face , \ 
It's a Good Mornin ' Beautiful Day . 
Staring at the ceiling , wondering if anything's really worth it , if theres any point in trying anymore .

Hear me now\ 
My final friends\ 
And listen swift\ 
As my breath ends\ 
Life for me\ 
Was but a curse\ 
And now reminded\ 
That it is much worse\ 
Suffering\ 
My nearest friend\ 
Was with me here\ 
As flesh did rend\ 
And Misery\ 
Who always knew\ 
Just what to say\ 
To make me blue\ 
Misfortune\ 
Who's been with me since birth\ 
Is well aware\ 
They've been my curse\ 
And welcome Death\ 
Oh kind release\ 
From my friends\ 
You < PROPMALE > me peace 
Bored ... Anybody up for talking ? 
It's the end of the world . \ 
As in Heaven , as in Earth , we`ve been dead since our birth . \ 
Let's watch this city burn , from the sky lines on top of the world , \ 
Till there's nothing left in her , \ 
Let's watch this city burn the world . 
< ('o')^\ 
< PROPFIRST > says ' Hi!' 
Wants somebody to chat with , anyone up for talking ? 
Hates not knowing how to help those he cares for 
Tired ... Is there no other way to express it ? No . Tired expresses my mind perfectly . 
It's sad to say that this pain is killing me inside , But it's time to say that this pain is keeping me alive . Twisting and turning it rips through my heart , It's been tearing me apart . 
Ok , what's going on with the 21 Questions thing ? It keeps saying I'm answering questions tonight , and I haven't answered anything since early this morning * Headtilt * 
Villager : \Do virgins taste better than those who are not ? \ 
Dragon : \Yes 
Madness Brings Gladness 
So ... found out my Grandpa < PROPMALE > died this morning 
Haha ... So ... Grandpa dies this morning , then somebody gets stabbed at Summer Celebration , Plus , a little less than a week ago , my Great Uncle died . Death is in the air , can you feel it ? 
* Sigh * I could really use some good news for once ... 
I still can't sleep -__- 
So beyond tired ... Not cool .

Buona notte ciascuno

Stars are dancin ' on the water here tonight\ 
It's good for the soul when there's not a soul in sight\ 
This boat has caught its wind and brought me back to life 
Angels fall out from the sky , One by one they're scattering , Like they've all gone blind . 
\If you would change your perspective\ 
I wish I could unremember\ 
Everything my heart's been through\ 
I'm finding out it's impossible to do\ 
Oh , it's no use\ 
I can't unlove you 
Heading to my granddad's funeral reception thing at 2 ... 
Heading off , later all ... 
Wow ... Well ... I'm back I guess , so ... anybody around to talk ? 
I'm gonna miss that smile , I'm gonna miss you my friend . \ 
Even though it hurts the way it ended , I'd do it all again . \ 
So play it sweet in heaven cause that's right where you wanna be . 
I'm tired of being looked down on . If you don't like me how I am , then that's too bad . Move on , with or without me . I'm done fighting for you . 
It's so easy to be evil , \ 
This is the life you see , \ 
The Devil tips his hat to me . \ 
I do it all because I'm evil\ 
And I do it all for free , \ 
Your tears are all the pay I'll ever need ! 
I'm about to fade out in a minute . Just to find out , send me a message and tell me my best and worst traits are , both physical and mental , please 
Dreams fade , Truth revealed , Reality remembered , Sorrow sealed . 
So , the cover < PROPFEMALE > to Madness is finished , or at least the rough form is 
Bummer , the rain passed , back to being alone ... 
My shoes are wet -.- 
Been working way to long , and guess what I have to do now ? More Work ! Sometimes I wonder if it's all really worth it 
Così , io sono annoiati , nessuno intorno ? \ 
So , I'm bored , anybody around ? 
Bubblybubblybubblybubblybubbly ... BUBBLE PARTY !!!! * Throws bubbles everywhere * 
The shadows of nemo call upon me , \ 
Whispering miseries , I'll never be free . \ 
Nothing does matter in this life once more , \ 
For my life is ended , and settled the score . 
I see a shadow on my mirror , too lazy to see what it is * Eyeroll * 
Feels sick , not cool 
Thinks he should go find some food 
Nevermore doth my heart sing out , \ 
For silence sings it's painful song , \ 
Alone , abandoned , unloved am I , \ 
Forevermore will my life be gone . 
Wow ... Just ... Wow ... I didn't see that coming at all ... 
Deathscore for July : 3 , so far 
So ... Depressing day ... Sympathies ? 
Out- out are all the lights- out all ! \ 
And , over each quivering form , \ 
The curtain , a funeral pall , \ 
Comes down with the rush of a storm , \ 
While the angels , all pallid and wan . \ 
Uprising , unveiling , affirm\ 
That the play is the tragedy , \Man 
Thinks a combination of storm and insomnia makes him talk to much , and scare off friends 
Listening to the the thunder and enjoying the beauty of it all 
I am so tired of being alone ... 
So ... yeah ... for some reason FB is not showing my posts half the time . I'm testing this again , so you can probably ignore this 
Like my status & I'll tell you one thing I like , one thing I dislike , a confession & my first impression of you . (: 
PM me if you've ever had a crush on me , if you do still , or if not , why not . I dunno why , boredom mostly , and I want to see if there's anybody who'll actually answer this 
PM me if you've ever had a crush on me , if you do still , or if not , why not . I dunno why , boredom mostly , and I want to see if there's anybody who'll actually answer this , though I doubt anybody will , nobody ever does 
I'm never alone \ 
I'm alone all the time \ 
Are you at one \ 
Or do you lie \ 
We live in a wheel \ 
Where everyone steals \ 
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields \ 
Bush - Glycerine 
As darkness craves the mind\ 
We come undone without our pride\ 
No time on the earth to come\ 
All the pleasures just begun\ 
40 < PROPMALE > from the sun\ 
40 < PROPMALE > From The Sun - Bush 
Let the rain pour down upon this Earth , \ 
Erasing the paths of those who were . \ 
Nothing ever stays the same , \ 
Changed forever by the falling rain . 
40 < PROPMALE > From the Sun , the song is what he hears , \ 
Describing his whole life , and showing what he fears . \ 
Alone , unloved , in a hopeless place , he scatters away his dreams , \ 
He forgets himself in his music , he's gone now , nothing's what it seems . \ 
He never wanted to be alone , his only friend , his gun , \ 
He was found lying on the floor , 40 < PROPMALE > From the Sun . 
What a worthless friend I turn out to be , what I'd give to take their pain , nothing's left now here for me ... 
Typical , I'm the bad guy . I'm the worthless one . I'm the one who's always wrong . Nothing ever changes . Do you even care about me at all ? Or do you talk to me just to make me suffer ? 
\I need to lose to make it right\ " 40 < PROPMALE > From The Sun - Bush\ 
I suppose it's time to greet my nightmares again ... 
Sometimes I really hate sleeping , process of the night ; Sleep , Nightmare , Wake up , sleep , nightmare , wakeup , sleep , nightmare , Wake up , repeat , repeat , repeat . I woke up about 7 times overall -.- 
Is about to pass out , just loaded more hay , and soon I've got to go take care of animals ... So ... Beyond ... Tired ... 
YAY ! I'm Done ! * Passes Out * 
These dreams I keep having are bothering me ... Death , loneliness , emptiness , regret , recurring relentlessly ... 
Sand Burs = Evil Incarnate . \ 
Also , I'm still tired -.- 
\Help me sometimes 
BOOYA ! * Is in a great mood * Just bought Hannibal , and Silence of the Lambs , * Shall be watching movies all night now * 
Chips'n'Cheese!!!!! DORITOS !!!!! 
Woah , had a really weird dream last night that had a lot of my friends in it ... * Is tempted to try to go back to sleep and try to continue it * 
The rain is awesome . Seriously , all I have to say about it . 
is my_____ . He has a nice _________ . Dang , he is_______ . I __________ him . Make this your status and see what answers you get ! 
Massive headache . Seriously . 
* Has the hiccups * -.- 
What is with me and all these weird dreams lately ? Wish I could've continued it , but it didn't work -.- 
Meh ... Just feel like asking tonight , message me if you've ever had a crush on me , if you still do , or anything like that really 
And I heard as it were , The noise of thunder , One of the four beasts saying come and see , And I saw , And behold a pale horse . \ 
And I heard a voice amidst the four beasts , And I looked and behold , a pale horse . And his name that sat on him was death , And Hell followed after him . 
Why's it that couples almost always seem to be flaunting their happiness in front of me ? Stupid singleness . 
Listening to some music , enjoying the feel , it's nice , to be able to let go of all of life's problems , replace them with sounds that cannot be compared , bliss . 
Watching Silence of the Lambs again , Hanibal Lecter is fun 
Feeling a strange sense of nostalgia ... \ 
It's kinda nice , but now I miss my old friends , I want to catch up with the people that mean so much to me , so seriously , drop me a line , send me a message , or better yet a letter , just get ahold of me ! 
She said she loved me , all night long\ 
I couldnt help but let her string my heart along\ 
I knew better , I still do\ 
But I'm not the first man who's ever played the fool

\It sucks to be me ! \ " Avenue Q " 
Nothing lasts forever , \ 
Life is but a game . \ 
And fools , those that do play it , \ 
The way they play , I'm filled with shame . \ 
Nobody wins , \ 
This game is a lie , \ 
No matter who it is , \ 
Every player dies . 
Thank Heaven ! the crisis-\ 
The danger is past , \ 
And the lingering illness\ 
Is over at last-\ 
And the fever called \Living\ " \ 
\There is no great genius without some touch of madness . \ " \ 
\I have found both freedom and safety in my madness ; the freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood 
Hollow ... 
I'm gonna cast off these shadows , \ 
I'm gonna take whats deserved . \ 
I'm gonna throw away the memories , \ 
Gonna get rid of the hurt . \ 
Nothing really matters , \ 
What it was you did to me , \ 
So I shattered your illusion , \ 
And set the true me free . \ 
I'm gonna take whats mine , \ 
I'm gonna stand up tall , \ 
I'm gonna run my life , \ 
And I'll never fall . 
Watching Advent Children 
\Don't cry Loz\ " :P " 
Alone . Forever . 
Hold me under , Let the river wash away my sins , Let me drown and you , Let the water and the love rush you . You can hear me whisper , When you're listenin , And I'm lost to you , Yeah I'm lost to you ... 
Now the sun's gone to hell\ 
And the < PROPFEMALE>'s riding high\ 
Let me bid you farewell\ 
Every man has to die\ 
But it's written in the starlight\ 
And every line on your palm\ 
We're fools to make war\ 
On our brothers in arms 
Time keeps passing me on by . And though I am alone , still I try . There's no greater sorrow , than being left behind , It causes dire madness , to rise within the mind . 
Has ESP !!!!!

Feels unnaturally good tonight , its strange but nice . I feel at peace for the first time in the longest time . At peace , that really describes it for me perfectly . 
How many times I've wondered\ 
And it still comes out the same\ 
No matter how you look at it or think of it\ 
It's life , and you just gotta play the game\ 
Rainy Night in < PROPFEMALE > - < PROPFIRST > Young 
Still in a great mood , so yay ! Got a good song in my head , and while my neck's a little stiff , overall I feel great ! Anybody wanna talk or anything ? 
Nothing like a long hot shower to relax those stiff muscles . Feel soooo much better now . 
My Machete is sharp again ! Yay ! 
Random Thought of the hour : Imagine the Mad Hatter on LSD . 
At peace with the world , life , and ultimately myself . Music that once depressed me I now find uplifting , giving me happiness . Invernia ... For that is the song of my peace . That is my true feeling in song . 
Note : Cold leftovers equals great morning food ! 
\And it's you I see but you don't see me\ 
I don't know what it is , but I am feeling really down tonight 
You know , I feel a lot better now , so yeah , awesomeness 
Well , my openhouse was ok , kinda bummed that so few of my friends showed up , but thank you for coming guys , I appreciate it 
Discovered that there are some people who think me to be mysterious ... Still not seeing it 
So wanting to relax right now ... 
Smart zombies = Not good 
Wish I had someone I could just < PROPFEMALE > out with . Watching movies alone isn't anywhere near as good as watching them with another ... 
So ... If I ever manage to cosplay , it'd be Sieg Wahrheit I'd be doing it as * Nods * 
Bored ... 
BANG !! That was cool ! 
Another suitcase of scar shaped souvenirs \ 
That I've collected every day that you're not here \ 
Another closet of busted up skeleton bones \ 
Chasing off your ghost 
Wake to thy madness , and therein feel the truth , All that exists on this plane of nothing is pain which the past brings forth , reminding thee of thy great joys , and exposing thy suffering of the present . 
\I would trade it all \ 
Walking in darkness , amidst the chaotic planes , \ 
Nightmares awaken , and bring life to all pains . \ 
As wake do I , from my shadowed rest , \ 
The fears of the night do so strongly attest . \ 
And now I sit thinking , in worried respite , \ 
Out are they searching , I pray she's alright . 
The loneliness within me\ 
Takes a heavy toll\ 
' Cause it burns as slow as whiskey \ 
Through an empty aching soul\ 
And the night is like a dagger\ 
Long and cold and sharp\ 
As I sit here on the front steps\ 
Blowing smoke rings in the dark 
Thats sad , I temporarily forgot how old I was -.- 
The rain falls where it wants to\ 
The wind blows where it will\ 
Everything on earth goes somewhere\ 
But I swear we're standin ' still\ 
So I'm not going to wake you\ 
I'll go easy on your heart\ 
I'll just touch your face and drift away\ 
Like smoke rings in the dark 
If you think im hot , like this status . If you love me put a ?. If I am \ 
your friend put a \(: \ " If you want to go out with me put a :D . If you \ 
Mmmm .... Bacon ...

So ... anybody want to shoot FB chat creators with me ? I can't even log back into it now -.- 
Wow , immature enough ? I say Hi , and get yelled at for it . How sad is that ? You really are pathetic < PROPFEMALE > . Thanks , glad to know how immature you really are . 
Well , now that that rather unpleasant business is dealt with , I realize that I don't care anymore . Would have loved to stay friends , but she's too immature to understand that . * Shrugs * Whatever , maybe someday she'll grow up . Until then , on with life ! 
Going to start up on my book again :D 
So ... Supposedly getting my hair cut today 
Watching Fast & Furious , looking forward to Sunday 
Well , I'mma gonna crash now 
Good morning -__- \

Looks like I'm joining a tournement . 
Waiting for somebody to get home -.- 
\Life is just a dream on the way to Death \"" 
Working on a bio , watching Ironman , what's going on with all the others this wonderful night ? 
Bio is complete . Minor touch ups may occur . Not sure ... 
Waiting around , gentle music , peace . Breathe . Beauty in all . Wild nature , calm , powerful , majestic . Compared to nothing . Life . 
Chilling with < PROPFIRST > , it's nice having company over 
Had a lot of fun with < PROPFIRST > over , looking forward to next time . Also : Need more comfortable chairs and a way to block the stupid pipe above them .

I blame you < PROPFEMALE > , now I'm watching the Musical Bleach things . -.- \ 
Also , planning on going for a walk today , I love the rain !

Let me stand here all night \ 
Did she take her own life \ 
Let me know she's alright \ 
I'll stay strong , I'll be fine \ 
< PROPFEMALE > on with my life \ 
I still stare at the sky \ 
Pray for rain , all the time \ 
Why'd you run ? Did you hide \ 
Why'd you leave , no good bye \ 
When the clouds , take the sky \ 
Does a soul , give you life ? \ 
Parts of a good song 
It's official , I feel worthless ... 
\So I speak to you in riddles \ 
So totally going to Hell XD 
\The silence is what kills me\ 
Watching Spirited Away 
Edit : Watching Spirited Away while nomming on Ramen :D 
So ... Spirited Away is over , Ramen is gone , all that's left now is Howl's Moving Castle 
Awesome thunder storm this morning ! 
\Well I have gone insane 
Well ... I guess I'm going to go then ... 
\I'll make a soldiers decision to fly away 
\Give me skies of black and blue 
\I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my T . V . \ 
So Sassy , our Coatimundi died today ... 
Going to sleep ... Night everybody ... 
I'm cold . Really , really cold . Also , I'm leaving in about 45 minutes to go clean a house , hopefully finish today 
Now if I die , I die complete . 
I want to live in an underground military bunker !!!! 
Watching The Punisher ! 
In Soviet Russia , < PROPMALE > finds you . 
Father come save us from this madness we're under , \

New Anime : Highschool of the Dead\ 
Status : Ongoing -.- \ 
This could be a problem , it's amazing so far , which means I'm gonna be really anxious for new episodes to come up 
\Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs ; he alone suffered so deeply that he had to invent laughter\ " \ 
\Open skies are falling

Got to see a bunch of my old friends today , it was nice , and thanks to SOMEONE , my right ear is still ringing xD\ 
Still , glad I got to see you guys , I'll try and make it out that way again soon 
Silver figures crafted by the heavens , \ 
Dancing and shifting amongst the shadows . \ 
Majestic paintings sent to Earth by her sister , < PROPFEMALE > .

Thinking about going for a walk in the rain 
Nothing like a long walk in the rain to ease the mind 
I can hear music from across the block o.O 
If you really knew me , you would know that I have been abused , and suffered much of my life and that I am just tired of always being alone 
So ... I've been without internet for the past few days , and we may be without again , I'm not sure ... So yeah , just figured I'd let you know if you've been trying get ahold of me . 
Now I walk towards my eternal slumber , nightmares that plague my mind . Evermore shall this path I walk be mine . My misery , and my pain . Yet I smile , despite my sorrows , knowing full well that in this torment of my life , are those that care , and those that love , and for this , this small favor that the world has granted me , I feel not the strains that I rightfully should . 
The shadows of frustration have released my internet , for now . -.- \ 
I hate my internet ... 
Awake , shoulder still hurts , going to my Dad's today for a bit . Also , very cold . Stupid cold weather . Worst part is that it's not even that cold -.- 
Let the silence ring forth in the minds of the living , ever reminding those that walk upon this planet , that not all is good , nothing in this world is pure and fair . All is corrupted by the very nature that we exist by ; Humanity , for which we are , for which we die , nothing is right . Forget the ideals of purity and love . Nothing exists but the miseries of truth , and it's cruel gift known to the world as ' Hope ' 
Take my life , o great beast of nothing , for thou hast taken away that which is most dear to me . Alone in time I stand , though time moves around me , my heart broken , cast aside and alone . 
Is wondering why fate is so cruel ...

I just got slimed by an Alpaca -.- 
Halfway done , bit more to do , and then I'll be done . Not looking forward to what's next :( 
Anybody up for talking ? Message me 
Only one person ? \ 
Sadness ... \ 
Guess I'll watch Advent Children then 
Fun is fun and done is done 
As I go to sleep , I think of those I care for , but I wonder ... Who thinks of me ? \ 
Good night ... 
Ugh ... I just want to go back to sleep ... 
Hot shower fixes almost everything * Nods * 
Watching Legion 
I need a new bed . * Pain * 
In a great deal of pain still ... 
Boredom Question : Message me if you've ever wanted to date me and I'll answer any three questions you ask , no matter what 
Huh ... Well , can't say it wasn't expected 
\No will to wake for this morn 
Evermore we dance this dance , step by step we walk our paths , only to return yet again to our beginnings , evermore and eternal . 
I am alone here , alone . Do you see me ? Can you here me as I cry out to you ? No , once long ago you may have heard me , but now , now I am nothing . Cast aside in your sight . Forgotten and abandoned . Who will rescue me from my lonely abyss ? 
Something burns within my soul ... I don't know what to do ... I have no one here to hold ... Loneliness in spite burns through ...

Everything's blue ... 
\Red is the < PROPFEMALE > that in yonder garden grows\ 
I hate the cold 
\Thank Heaven ! the crisis-\ 
Here in the darkness , in shadows serene , eternally wandering in this place of rest . I contemplated what may come , and what had passed . This life that we live , ever so short that it is , we spend the time we have seeking out some form of completion ; Some way that we may become whole , and leave behind the troubles of our lives . What do I seek , this I pondered as I wandered amidst the forgotten stones ... 
' Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream ? '

Ever still , the emptiness fills , \ 
The < PROPMALE > sits upon his throne , \ 
And in his loss he fears the cost , \ 
And so remains alone . 
How is one to know that all others are not but a figment of madness , so well reinforced that we believe nothing else ?

Twisted my ankle earlier -.- 
Ok , what should I watch ? \ 
Advent Children\ 
Hannibal\ 
Fantastic Four\ 
or < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? 
Silver paintings acrossed the Earth , her celestial sister < PROPFEMALE > grants , casting away all things foul and draping them in a wonderous beauty . 
Wish : To be able to do more for those I love than just offer my apologies ... 
I'mma go lay down ... Not feeling very good :( 
I'mma watch My Neighbor Totoro now 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > or Fantastic Four ? 
< PROPMALE > Kong or Tokyo Drift ? 
Into the darkness , as my blood slows , I question ; Is this my time to die ? A quiet walk through the < PROPMALE > seemed so peaceful ... 
Hot shower makes almost everything better

Cold ... 
Into sorrowful solitude ... 
Well , plans fell through , but I suppose I didn't really expect otherwise , I'll find something to do I guess 
Evermore in darkness and in loss , shall you find me , cast aside by the gods , abandoned by the people , and forgotten by love ... 
Feels like watching old horror movies ... 
Nosferatu , dork 
Boredom ... 
Within this dark night , shadows that dance with the fog , eternity caught within a moment , it is found , and then it is gone . 
Goodnight world , nightmares prepare , I'll be with you shortly

Sleep , take me into your dark embrace ; Let me forget the troubles of my life , even for but a few hours ... 
\Things have turned a deeper shade of blue\ 
Farewell world of half truths and distortions ! I leave you readily , to seek out purer truths of the depths of the mind ! 
Ew ... Snow ... Gross ... 
I wonder ... so many things , each escaping into it's own lost pattern , one who cared uncaring now , I wonder is it true ? One who dreamed not dreaming now , I wonder is it true ? Life is but a riddle now , I wonder is it true ? 
\I don't want to set the world on fire\ 
< PROPFIRST > Helsing or Chronicles of Riddick ? 
All fades to black ... 
Had fun tonight , it's nice having company over once in a while 
Well ... As usual , I did nothing but make things worse ... 
Why waste my time trying , only to be ignored ? 
Meh ... 
I'm playing Pazaak !!! \ 
http://pazaak.vndv.com/\ 
I love this game :D 
Kinda bummed out right now ... 
\When you're dialing six < PROPFIRST > just to < PROPFEMALE > up the phone\ 
6574 : You're my best friend , and even though we've sort of lost contact with eachother lately , you still are my best friend . I still remember all of our conversations we've had . I still have the letter you sent me , and I still can't wait for when we finally get to see eachother . 
So ... feeling more alone than normal ... Bummer ... 
\Gravedigger\ 
\Now all depends on what I say to you 
Watching the old ' 67 Jungle Book 
\Oh how I love you\ 
Finally leaving ... I think -.- 
So ... slightly less than two hours sleep ... This could be the start of the old insomnia again ... I hope not though ... 
Ok , so ... Either somebody has been drilling nails into my arms without my knowing it , or I think I might have arthritis :( 
Kinda just blagh ... Tell me your honest oppinion of me , good and bad . Things you like about me , and what I need to improve . In return ... I dunno , I'll answer any 3 questions you have , or something else if you'd like 
Goodnight ... 
\Presence of people not for me 
\Welcome to the show the great finale's finally here \ 
Jealous of some , depressed by others ... Strange dreams await me tonight 
Tonight officially bites ... I'm gonna fade out I guess ... Night all 
MY INTERNET IS BACK !!!! Finally -.- 
I'm tired of these broken sorrows , the world may have forsaken , but I don't mind . Life can cut you down , but all you can do is enjoy what life hasn't taken away . Listen to the music , feel the beat , live it . Life will only get better when you want it too 
Hot shower feels sooo good 
\Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise . Seek what they sought . \ " \ 
Well ... Night ... 
Well ... This officially sucks ... 
\I would fall asleep\ 
\Now his love's a memory\ 
Alone tonight , as every night ... Such is Life . 
I don't want to be awake already !!!!! 
Well , goodnight all 
Not sure what to think at the moment ... 
Well , I'm out , I've gotta counter balance this holiday cheer . Horror movie it is , now I've just got to decide on what . 
So , Silent Hill , Doom , Resident Evil ( One of the 3 ) , White Noise , or The Grudge ? 
AND SILENT HILL STANDS VICTORIOUS ! Night all 
I'll always be here for you , even when we're apart . Remember that . Smile 
So despise being sick ... 
Totally watching Super < PROPFIRST > Bros . Like , the live version :D 
Feeling like a snowman 
\I thought I changed for you\ 
That motley drama—oh , be sure \ 
It shall not be forgot ! \ 
With its Phantom chased for evermore \ 
By a crowd that seize it not , \ 
Through a circle that ever returneth in \ 
To the self-same spot , \ 
And much of Madness , and more of Sin , \ 
And Horror the soul of the plot . 
O.O THE MASK IS ON !!!! YES ! :D 
\I just want to sleep a whole night through \ 
Just about drained a bottle of MUG in the last half hour 
Playing Dead Rising 
Killed by zombies . Stupid zombie snuck up on me -.- 
Damn hippy , making me start to think philisophically again -.- 
\And if I stay Lucky then my tongue\ 
I see my forever is one long night\ 
If I can make it dark , I can make it light\ 
I know that most of living done is done in the mind\ 
Only thought survives 
I just spent the last hour shoveling snow in an area that I was told wasn't going to get snowblowed . What does my stepdad do after I finish shoveling ? Come through and snowblow . I hate winter -.- 
\Do you remember me because\ 
Right-o , heading down to < PROPMALE > & Toms to see about a job , wish me luck 
Is going to have \Ultra Black\ " hair tomorrow " 
Watching Son In Law 
Down ... Such is life I suppose though ... 
\It ain't no secret to me 
Man ... Weird dreams last night , like ... I dunno ... People I haven't dreamed about in a while ... 
\But I never knew how quickly I would go\ 
I ... Can't ... Feel ... Anything ... \ 
I ... Hate ... Winter ... 
Totally watching Hannibal tonight 
Right on , right-o , I'm in a rather strange mood don't you know , oh no , here we go , again into the frozen land below , below . 
Ewwwwww ... I just looked outside 
Supremely hate being sick -.- 
So ... I've been watching Death Note , and now I'm into it . Also , I have Tea !!!! This makes me happy . 
It's official , Light Yagami creeps me out . 
Poor poor Light , dude still creeped me out though . 
Into the darkness I wander , and wonder , who will seek for me ? 
Well , the good news is , seeing as I have no school , there's very little to remind me about what tomorrow is during it 
Well , typical bad luck of the day already , my phone isn't working -.- 
There is nothing like nothing to remind one of who they are . Nor is there anything like anything to take them from despair . The mind empowers , but love alone can remove one from the dull ache that is living 
Bored ... So very bored ... Any movie suggestions ?

~ Edna St. < PROPMALE > Millay 
Too bloody early ... 
What the hell ? I hate Michigan weather -.- 
And if I stay Lucky \ 
Then my tongue will stay tied , \ 
And I won't betray the things that I hide . \ 
There's not enough years underneath this belt , \ 
For me to admit the way that I felt . 
And I'm the wave that crashes\ 
From the sea that turns itself\ 
Inside out every < PROPMALE > I get to\ 
See what it's like in hell 
For some reason I want to go swimming . Stupid Michigan weather ... 
Well , off I am to rest for now , though what rest I'll receive I cannot say , so to all those that care , Goodnight , Adieu , and Farewell 
So much frustration -.- \ 
1 . Killer headache is killer\ 
2 . One Piece is way to long\ 
3 . Buffering of said uber long anime is taking way too long\ 
4 . I'm bored\ 
5 . I'mma pass out soon I think\ 
As such , I'm headed off , later people 
It's the Blood that ties , \ 
It's the Hurt that heals , \ 
It's the face you hide , \ 
Hides the Pain you feel . \ 
So hold me up now , \ 
Yeah I'm afraid to breathe , \ 
And I'm lost to you ... 
Farewell one and all , listen and hear the night's sweet call 
I HAVE A LAPTOP NOW :D \ 
That is all 
Well almost one , I'm bored , and there's nothing else to keep me occupied , so I guess I'm out , later folks 
I'll see you in my dreams \ 
There we'll be safe tonight , \ 
From the lonely days of memory \ 
I'll see you in my dreams 
Happy April Fool's Day folks , hope you didn't get hit too hard , I know I've enjoyed it for the most part 
Well , looks like it's time to go catch the peacocks , this'll be fuuuuuun -.- 
Dies irae , Dies < PROPFEMALE > , Solvet saeclum in fav < PROPFEMALE > 
Only 400 more episodes left !!!! 
Happiness just won't have me 
Come on , come on and there'll be no turning back\ 
You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back\ 
Come on , come on , it's time to burn up the fuse\ 
You got nothing to do and even less to lose 
Well , I'm officially an uncle now , just figured some people might be interested 
The scent of the night air is ... Intoxicating 
I see the first lights of the < PROPFEMALE > sky 
Mmmmm , cold mornong pizza :D 
\Take me home\ 
So ... Plan for the night , draw a few different < PROPFEMALE > designs for the hippy , and then watch a movie , so ... Constantine , Sweeney < PROPMALE > , or < PROPFIRST > Scissorhands ?

April showers bring May flowers , Mayflowers bring Small Pox 
Walked in the rain 
So ... Cold ... 
\Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty . \ " \ 
If you had to pick a place to survive during a zombie invasion , where would it be ? 
Hush Child , The darkness will rise from the deep and < PROPFEMALE > you down into sleep ... 
Truth is ... \ 
Yeah , I'm doing this thing again , like it and I'll tell you the truth 
I love the rain and I think I heard some thunder too , so I'm happy 
Thunder and lightning and rain pouring down , some find it frightening , that beautiful sound 
< PROPFEMALE > of the Dead , Land of the Dead , or Suggest your own zombie movie , trying to decide 
Presence of people not for me . \ 
Well I must remain in tune , forever , \ 
My love is music . \ 
I will marry < PROPFEMALE > . 
Sleep was ... Interesting 
I hate cleaning , like ... A lot . 
So today ... Ignored , Annoyed , Sneezing , Headache , Tired , and feeling Sick , today's going great ! 
\Saw a man in the movies that didn't have a heart\ 
Well , two in the morning , nobody screaming at me or anything anymore , so I'm feeling much more relaxed now , less sick , although I've still got a headache , so I think I'm going to fade out , goodnight people who don't actually read this !
