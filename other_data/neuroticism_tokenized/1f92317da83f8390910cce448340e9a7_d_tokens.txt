Enjoying some warm tea and early christianity readings 
One small step ... but it was an important one 
Tonight was perfect . In the most simple of ways ... 
Its raining ? I don't even remember seeing actual clouds .... 
5 Likewise , you who are younger , be subject to the elders . Clothe yourselves , all of you , with humility toward one another , for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble . ” 1 < PROPFIRST > 5:5 
I need yoga .... need it .... 
Insanity : doing the something over and over again and expecting a different result 
Big bear for the day with bean <3

\Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts 
I would rather believe I had a choice in my life than think that it is purely based on < PROPFEMALE > and DNA 
If you care about people let them know . Verbally tell them , send them a note , give them a hug , show them you care ..... that is a real gift 
Well that was awkward ... 
relaxing girls night with < PROPFEMALE > ? I think yes . 
mmmmmm I think I could eat veggies all the time ... so yummy <3 
:( 
Everyone's prayers for < PROPMALE > during this time are honestly so appreciated . He is stable , he is going to recover with God's strength on his side ! Thank YOU ALL for the support . <3 
Sometimes , what we see is perception , not truth 
If someone takes the jacket off your back , give them your tunic also . Chances are they need it more than you do 
< PROPMALE > is coming home today !!!! Heading back to newport to spend some time with my family . I am so happy he is going to be home . Praise God ! <3 <3

Great workout today .... 
A peaceful night with a glass of wine . Sometimes , a night to yourself ... is exactly what you need <3 
If only we could be what our loved ones seem to see us to be ... 
Life is a progression of forward moving events . You can move with it , or get left behind . <3 
This rain makes me want to cuddle up under a blanket and watch a movie . Mmmmm <3 
Evening with my sick bestie . Cuddle and movie time !!! Vitamins don't fail me now !! 
You only live it once and when your dead its done .... so let the good times roll

Dayquil is my lifesaver 
Goldfish , oranges and and orange < PROPFEMALE > tea . I don't need a spray tan , ill be orange before you know it !

Ahhhh no gas pricesssss noooooooooooooooooooooooo ! 
\being right is way over rated and being right can be very lonely\ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE >." 
What makes you trust someone ? 
\it's not the load that breaks you down its the way you < PROPFEMALE > it \"" 
I just scheduled \laundry time\ " on my calander so that I'd make sure not to schedule anything else ... I can't believe I'm this busy " 
I'd love to live on a lack of expectations and an abundance of serving and giving 
\dont put up with people who are reckless with your heart \"" 
Sometimes people come into your life and change everything and sometimes they prove to you what you already knew from the start 
Life is great ! 
I seriously spent 30 minutes trying to find a way to the gym . I parked ridiculously far , run up a huge hill and changed in my car all so that i could find out that the gym was closed for the big game .... I'm going home to do yoga . No one can tell me I'm not devoted to working out ... even when it doesn't work out 
Our relationships give us wisdom . Our life experiences , our challenges and our adventures give us knowledge and strength to go on another day . I am grateful for all the things and people who have changed me into who I am today . <3 
\for the Lord is your security . He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap \"- Proverbs 3:26 " 
Feelings are fickle funny things ... even when you realize you shouldnt pay attention ... they seem to know how to punch you in the gut 
okay you all finally won . Im on words with friends . Add me : kaybond 
slept in , long walk , cleaned my apartment , homework ... productive day ! <3 
Is getting SO excited for my birthday next week . I feel so loved already ! <3

The holy spirit gives us freedom 
\One gave me the sexy eyes ... while we were at the family mart \"- < PROPFIRST > Rogers " 
La < PROPMALE > té vraie est votre intérieur de < PROPMALE > té qui est pourquoi personne ne vous voit comme vraiment < PROPMALE > 
if only running thoughts burned calories ... I'd be so thin ... 
Doing an early morning spin class . I think I can .... i think I can .... 
I live in a family of extremely artistically-gifted people . Seriously ... its ridiculous .... 
Is having a progressing conversation about comm theory where we are continuing to do things and point out theories with < PROPFIRST > Gray . I am proud to be apart of this ridiculously geeky conversation . ( self disclosure ) 
It is amazing how a change in number of people present can change a persons entire decision on rules of proper interaction ... 
Sometimes you push , shove , wiggle , bend and even break a puzzle piece in an effort to make it fit where you think it belongs ... instead of accepting the fact that there is a place it would smoothly transition from one piece to a beautiful picture . 
Gonna bake as a reward for all my studying recently . Yummmmy :) 
\God arms me with strenght ... he makes my way as surefooted as a deer enabling me to stand on mountain heights\ " psalm 18:32 -33 " 
I must be going crazy ... i havent been on time for one thing today . Not very like me .....

Girls nightttt <3

It is accepted that some days are better than others , but on the bad days .... what do you see when you look up into the sky ? Do you see the sun peaking through the clouds or that there is a cloud in the beautiful blue sky ? 
You'll never abandon me . You'll never forsake me , You never will . You'll never abandon me , You never will break Your word .... You thrill me ! <3 
Mmmmmmm yoga <3

Hey everyone ! Check out my mom's facebook < PROPFEMALE > Trochia ! She rocks :) 
Gym time ... getting this week started off right ! 
Life is a succession of forward moving events .... either you move with it , or get lost in the shuffle . 
Just got my butt kicked by spin class . Woohooo . 
\Guard me as you would guard your own eyes . Hide me in the shadow of your wings . Protect me from wicked people who attack me from muderous enemies who surround me . \ " Pslam 17 : 8-9 " 
Working out in the morning is an addiction ... already done for the day from 24 Hour Fitness

5 days in a row .... im even shocked at myself 
Life ... is amazing . What a blessing !!!! im overwhelmed with happiness <3 
sometimes ... dancing around in the ocean at 1 in the morning in a full length dress is exactly what the mind , body and soul needs <3

Feliz cumpleaños a mi gran abuelita <3 < PROPFEMALE > es 99 hoy ! ay yiyi :) 
I am coveting my old hair ... please grow faster ... PLEASE 
Sometimes when you loose control its more fun to just let go and play along and sometimes you have to pick up the reins and grow up ... 
I have God as my support so I can stand up tall and encourage all those who are near me ... 
Anyone else in PB here a large explosion and have all their lights go out for a second ? Sure made Haines St. interesting for a moment ! 
My heart is overwhelmed with passion for Him today . Feeling so blessed for this gift 
Finished class uber early tonight . Which is fabulous so I can go home and study something else ... 
How is it that I can go from 5 am until 11pm every day and still tell myself I would love to have more hours in the day and constantly be adding things to my to do list ... I love my life :) 
Everyone has an impact in your life somehow . Think about how you must impact others . Is that howd you like to be remembered/known ? 
Even though my cycling class was full I managed to find a way to workout . One full hour of hot c2 yoga . Mmmmmmm <3

God gives us opportunities ... and the free will to follow Him with the opportunities or not 
woke up this morning thinking I'd do 50% effort during spin . ended up doing 85% instead . walking a little funny . feeling amazing . great start to today ! 
\Our generation is one of instant gratification . We have grown up in a world where information and wants are so readily available that they idea of having to wait ( even if not for that long ) has started to become unbearable . \"" 
situations that are poorly handled can lead to a mudslide of future unfortunate events ... 
5 miles .. farthest distance yet ! Gotta keep chugging .... 
so I stopped and closed my eyes and let happiness fall over me like the sun on a perfect spring day <3 
Can't wait to be dancing with my loves tomorrow night ... so so so so close .... <3

\Sometimes it strikes me how poverty and privilege became silent neighbors and the world just keeps going because it has to . \"- OTH "
