Lord have mercy all you buggies folk .. 

Hey golfers check pga tour online . If anyone wants to play it's free this weekend . 
Came this close to buying Athens little store and turning it into a bbq . A friend of mine owns it and was willing to sell for 20k , payable as a percentage of the profit . But the rent was too high and the landlord wouldent allow renovations or even let me change the sign . Im just so disgusted I could scream . If I had had the 20k in my hand i could open up a place here in town . 
A weekend spent in retrospect \ 
Remembrance with some regret\ 
Shining faces I still recall \ 
When all of us were very small 
As some of you may know I have been working on my fiction writing . In the meantime I have been writing articles and reports on various subjects for a site called rant/rave . I get paid by google for advertising clicks . It's nothing < PROPMALE > , but I've made a couple hundred so far this month . If your interested check out the articles . If you see an ad for something you like click it . But no need to go nuts .

Happy Birfday < PROPFIRST > . I wish you more blessings then you can count . 
What do you remember ? I remember < PROPMALE > Hickey taking a face plant in front of his house from a rather poorly designed ramp .
