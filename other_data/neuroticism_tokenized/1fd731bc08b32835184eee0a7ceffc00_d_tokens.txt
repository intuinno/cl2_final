We don't forget .... Our heads may be small , but they are as full of memories as the sky may sometimes be full of swarming bees , thousands and thousands of memories , of smells , of places , of little things that happened to us and which came back , unexpectedly , to remind us who we are .

fuck YOU 
Nothing is easier than self-deceit ... You hold the answers deep within your own mind . Consciously , you've forgotten it . That's the way the human mind works . Whenever something is too unpleasant , to shameful for us to entertain , we reject it . We erase it from our memories . But the imprint is always there .
