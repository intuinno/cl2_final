Going gray trying to finish the yearbook DVD ... \ 
Why don't things go the way they're planned :( 

DVD done just in time :) Now maybe I can get some sleep . 
In Bryson City , NC . Will be home tomorrow evening . 
Made it home in one piece . Woody is resting peacefully . We're looking forward to sleeping in our own beds !!!! :) 
Florida's Rainy Season : \Solar dryers\ " aren't as dependable . " 
Vacations over . One week to get VBS crafts together :( 
A poncho doesn't do much good when riding your bike in a < PROPFEMALE > down pour . I'm still drying out :( 
Sand , glue , 10 Kindergarten - Second graders , and 20 minutes ... Things can get pretty messy . I survived Night 3 of VBS 2010 crafts . Only 2 nights of \Deep Sea Adventure\ " left . " 
VBS is done for me . \ 
I think next year ... I'll be on vacation during VBS , so I won't \accidentally\ " be in charge of crafts . My fingers are sore and I'm exhausted ... \ 
< PROPMALE > took < PROPMALE > to an intro to Lacrosse clinic . Home alone . What will I do ... Fold cloths and pick up the living room , the piano tuner is coming tomorrow . 
Last night of < PROPMALE>'s Lacrosse clinic ... He seems to have enjoyed it . 
Finally rested up from VBS . \ 
Now to all my summer projects : painting the house , preparing next years yearbook program ... and the list goes on and on and on and on ... 
Working hard to get back into my Wii Fit routine . But ... 4:30 is so early . 
went shopping with < PROPMALE > . I think we have everything he'll need for Operation Catapult . One week until he flies off into the ... sunrise ( 7 am flight ) . 
will be shopping for luggage . < PROPMALE > doesn't want to take a floral tapestry suitcase to camp . I don't know why ... it's my \dream\ " luggage . " 
Apparently empty bird feeders make inviting homes for spiders and \wasps . \ " \ 
is making sure < PROPMALE > gets everything packed . He's off to 2 1/2 weeks of sample college life ... a long way from home in the morning . 
made it home from the airport by the time < PROPMALE > was scheduled to take-off . He should land in Indianapolis at 9:16 . Time to go back to bed . 
made brownies to send to < PROPMALE > . I hope he shares . 
finally got to talk to Jonathon . \ 
It was a good long phone call . He's doing well , except for ... \ 
not knowing where his cell phone is . :) 
back from St. < PROPFIRST > . Had a good time . \ 
Photos coming soon . 
may not dread doing laundry when < PROPMALE > is in college . \ 
Only four loads and it was all done . And ... \ 
it all fit on the clothes line ! 
Sorry to everyone that got a message about me answering a question about you . \ 
I realized after I'd answered the questions that I needed to check the box to not send messages . If you haven't checked out 21 Questions , in my option , don't bother . There are many off color questions that I did not find entertaining at all . \ 
To whomever answered that I have smoked ... I haven't! \ 
Unless you're counting second hand smoke . 
< PROPMALE > made it home from camp ... \ 
with no cell phone . 
Happy Anniversary to us_\ 
Happy Anniversary_ < PROPMALE > and Ruth_\ 
Happy Anniversary to us ! \ 
21 years and counting !

Ways to know you have a senior living in your house . \ 
1 . All of the mail is from universities across the country addressed to your child .

2 . You plan vacations to include visits to universities .

Happy Birthday to < PROPMALE > . \ 
He didn't let Facebook tell you it was his birthday , so I thought I'd share . 
Today my baby boy , officially an adult , starts his last semester of high school . \ 
Where does the time go ...

Current temp ... 39 ? 
Please pray for < PROPMALE > . He just found out he wasn't excepted at the University of Florida . He is very disappointed and a little upset . Please DON'T sent your sympathy to him . I don't think it would be well received right now . Just keep him in your prayers . \ 
Thanks ! 
yearbook today . Four weeks left with the staff . Things are getting finished . After yearbook , I'm headed to Florida Blood Centers to donate blood . I'll get \dinner and a movie\ " as a thank you gift . " 
found out that < PROPMALE>'s graduation announcements and cap and gown will be here on March 14 or 15 . I guess I need to start working on open house invites to send out with the announcements and senior pictures . \ 
\ 
My baby is really going to graduate from high school ... \ 
where does the time go ? 
It's official . < PROPMALE > will be attending Trevecca Nazarene University in the fall ! Now we just have to find out how much it will cost . 
Those of you with responsible children/teens ... \ 
I hope you know how blessed you are . 
Spring break has begun . \ 
Time to get to work . Yearbook needs to get finished so I can concentrate on getting ready for graduation and company . 
It's hard to be productive on a rainy day .
