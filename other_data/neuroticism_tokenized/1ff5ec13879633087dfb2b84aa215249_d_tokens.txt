The Troublesome Truth Only Leads to Half-witted Happiness 

Got in an argument today ... here's the final result :\ 
\ 
Stranger : The bible says that gay people are wrong ! \ 
Me : It also says that 2 of every animal in the world can fit on a boat . \ 
Stranger : So ? \ 
Me : Sorry ... but last time I checked , there were at least three million different kinds of animals on earth ! \ 
Stranger : And ? \ 
Me : 6,000,000 animals cannot all fit onto one boat , logically . \ 
Stranger : The bible isnt logical ! \ 
Me : ... 
And another one ... \ 
Stranger : i can speak/write good in english\ 
me : obviously not all that well ...

Plans with < PROPFEMALE > Hamel , my English < PROPMALE > , over the weekend ? I think yes ! 
Playing Ninja at debate camp ? Of course !

I still get chills every time I see < PROPMALE > leap out of Hagrid's arms and escape . Should I feel like a nerd for that ? 
School tomorrow <3 
Waiten ' at the bus stop :) 
When your AP English 3 class diverts to talking about < PROPMALE > Potter becoming a religion , you know you're in the right place . 
What GHAMAS does NOT prepare you for : School Spirit . 
It's so strange realizing that I would have just completed my first day as a < PROPMALE > at GHAMAS today , yet I'm thousands of < PROPMALE > away . 
Don't you just love that feeling when you finally realize it's Friday ? 
Well , looks like my schedule is officially in check . This year is mine . 
A Forty-Three to Fourteen win in football can definitely get your school spirit up ! I had an excellent night with < PROPFEMALE > Aranda , < PROPFEMALE > Aranda , < PROPFEMALE > Hamel , < PROPMALE > Cipione and others that I haven't added on Facebook yet ! The three day drive to get down here was definitely worth it ! School Spirit was never my strong suit , but it's growing on me , and I definitely plan on more football games ! :D 
It's that time already . I'll talk to y'all in the AM . :) 
So , there's an extremely large fire a little too close for comfort on the other side of the dam . We've dealt with snow . We've dealt with earthquakes . We've dealt with torrential rain and tornadoes . I suppose fire was just the next on the elemental list . 
It's still going on ? o.O Wild fire's don't give up ... 
I've just remembered there's homecoming here ... Uh oh . Now I HAVE to be social and try to meet people . :/ 
Those people that act wise to defend an opinion , when in reality it doesn't make a single iota of sense . 
If you've read The Forgotten Soldier , you should definitely message me right now . 
Turns out this \history repeats its self\ " thing is true in more ways than one . " 
If president Obama's approval ratings don't sky rocket because of this speech , I'll be shocked to death . 
Anyone have suggestions for good movies ? I need a few to watch tomorrow . 
How about we recognize those who have died everywhere ? How about we take this day , and instead of living in fear , we help those around us who have been affected by any death . Those who died and/or lost their house during Hurricane < PROPFEMALE > and all other hurricanes , the Haiti earth quake and all other earth quakes , the Texas wild fires and all other wildfires , 9/11 and every other terrorist activity , and any disaster at all . Rest in peace , to everyone . 
So ... about this \Dress as the opposite gender\ " thing going on during Friday ... " 
Oh dear ... 
When I was 7 ... \ 
I wanted to be : Nothing in particular . \ 
I was in a relationship with : No one . \ 
I was scared of : Nothing\ 
My best friends were : Did I have any ? \ 
I lived in : Canton , CT\ 
Like this and I'll give you an age . :) 
I could easily leave this status as a simple quote . I would find the perfect quote to match the atmosphere around me , and it wouldn't be a single trouble to leave y'all guessing at what it means . However , the atmosphere tonight calls for no quotes , and the just the cold hard truth . I watched another magnificent being die right before me , and it came no easier than the last . Rest in piece Cha-Cha , you little wanna-be Great < PROPMALE > you . You're pain is done . As for ours , we'll see . 
The people who wear so much make-up that it makes them look like they have powder from crushed up rocks on their faces . Oh wait ... 
The hobbit you just called fat ? He’s skipping 2nd breakfast . The dwarf woman you called ugly ? She spends hours braiding her beard so you can differentiate her from a dwarf man . The Uruk-Hai you just killed ? He’s been abused by Saruman . See that Gollum creature with the gangly limbs & large eyes ? For 500 years the Ring poisoned his mind . That Elf you just made fun of for crying ? She just lost her wizard friend to a Balrog . Put this as your status if you’re against bullying in Middle-Earth . 
Debate tomorrow ! Off to bed we go ! Well , we'll see . 
I think that being on a bus at school at 5:00 AM is a new enough experienced to wake me up a bit . 
broke into finals ! :D 
27 minutes to lift off . 
The ending of Silent Hill ... * sigh * 
When man's opinion of another places a veil over his head where as they cannot see the justice in another's opinion .

54 -16 Lake < PROPFIRST > ! Then again , who was actually surprised ? 
Hm ... Sailing is definitely a lot easier here ! ( Y'know , as opposed to a tall ship . 
Facebook will not charge it's users , as it makes million's of dollars a year due to advertisements it self . However , I think that Facebook should charge those who copy and paste that stupid status , as these people are too ignorant to be on the internet anyway . This means you too Contact Info paranoid freaks ...
