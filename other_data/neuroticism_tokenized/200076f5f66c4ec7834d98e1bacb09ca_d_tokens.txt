Legion was STUPID !!! S-T-U-P-I-D . Okay first second and third parts were cool , lots of action , scary little white kids coming at you with a knife making him seem like chuckie jr. Angels from heaven that turned to the dark side cause God was tired of humans pissing on the corners of his perfectly made home and decided to punish them . 
It has been made officially clear to me that in Ocarina of Time the sinking lure is no longer available in the future of the game . 
Sometimes I'd rather not think about it , but it still comes to mind . Those lips are rather enticing like juicy strawberries . ;]

On the bright side I'm still < PROPFEMALE>'s pimp . :3 <3

I haven't called him since tuesday ... I miss his voice , I miss a lot of things about him ...

I'm tired and i would like to go home . :)

Have you forgotten about me ? :( I miss speaking with you . 
I started out eating sibeche with everyone and then I moved into my room by myself and I ended up just eating the crackers . [ I hate sea-food so if no-one's looking at me i'll stop eating it . Even though its really good . ] I'm just not gonna think about it . ;] 
well here i am thinking philipin parties were exciting but it was a lie ! D= 
Got a new keyboard for the laptop ! YaaayyY !!! :) now the ' C ' and ' X ' works again !! Sooo happy . :] 
I just got done watching Interstellar 5555 , it's not what you think it is !!! ... Okay ... it's a daft punk series . :D 
I can't stop thinking of him , he's been in my dreams for nights on end . 
Miyavi's going to have to wait , :) i'm going to ocean shores that day to celebrate the one year anniversary , with the bf .... -silence- ... I guess it's more important then Miyavi ... ;~; 
Yaay ! My hair is back to black . :D woot woot . =D

Wha-bam ! D: I'm bored and not ready for work at all . I just wanna be home and be laaaazzzzyyy , like Fluffy . > 3 > And I got funny presents from my bf on my birthday lol . 
And here I am ... Awake . -insert a very long drawn out sigh here- :[ 
Going off to play monopoly . :D 
I want to go swimming but I need to go to work at 3:30 and where I live there is NO pool !!! T T-T T I also hate it when I have the fan on full blast and all that comes out is warm air . Oooh ... Summer how I've missed you . : 0 
Gotta wake up tomorrow at fucking 6 and then after that have a long ass day , atleast i'll be working with my favorite person EVER !! =D 
I'm confused , I'm tired , I work tomorrow , I feel lonely , why does God decide to put people in your path if God is telling these people that they'll need to leave else where ? Why is that so confusing ? 
I'm an impatient brat with a personality that adapts to others around me . And right now I'm feeling rather ... anxious . And it won't go away . My heart knows what to do , but my mind doesn't feel the same , and the fighting is taking a toll on everything I have . It's time to decide . Just like Uriel said , God doesn't make my decisions or what happens in my life . I do , and I want to take control of these strings around me . 
=] I love the way things are going right now , me avoiding a talk with my mom >_> , seeing my favorite people tomorrow , going to a wedding the end of this month , going to silverwood with < PROPFEMALE > , <3 AND then a birthday to celebrate with a special someone . :) 
tired but not sleepy . :) Looking forward to tomorrow [ or today ] , I'm sure my car is too , after all tomorrow's [ again ; today's ] payday and I'll finally be able to feed it some much needed gas and oil . :] And I'll get to < PROPFEMALE > out with my new man , I'm content at the moment . :P 
I don't regret the decision I made . Perhaps the way I went about it and what happened in between the decision and the aftermath wasn't the best , but it's whatever , what matters is if MY heart is satisfied if MY mind is content , if I'M the one who's happy . And that's just the way it is . 
Waxing the eyebrows is definitely better then having a lady threading them . It hurts way less . :] 
I'm very happy with where I'm going and with whom , the life we're looking at is absolutely beautiful . I'm looking forward to this new change in my life . Found the most gorgeous apartment . Hoping to call it home someday soon with him , <3 
I got my first standard car . A honda , woot woot , piece of shit that needs a hell of all lot of work . :) It's my piece of shit car that I'm proud of . lol 
I love him . :) 
I ain't scared of you foo !! > D 
Sooooo happy , :D 
Its whatevers . :) 
Yay for happy endings !! <3 I know life isn't a < PROPFEMALE > tale , but if I have the balls to face the problems and not run away , then who says I can't have the balls to get my happy ending ? Nothing like believing in someone you love right ? 
New number friends !! :) let me know if you want it !! 
I love the way my life is going right now , I really do , I'm now preparing for the next step in my life , :) but that's a secret . <3 
=] He's my life , wow he's the best . <3 
At work , aww snap , super slow ! D < hope it stays that way though ... :] 
Work is so busy on friday and saturday nights , its so depressing !!! For reals , can't wait to get ouuuuttt !!!!

Watching ppl being trapped inside bank of < PROPFEMALE > in southcenter , and seeing their reaction when they can't get out is hilarious . 
I'm not perfect I'm sorry , that doesn't mean you have to stop loving me for it . 
Isn't it funny when you're getting yelled at for doing your job , and you're not even getting yelled at by a manager , but a co-worker who doesn't know < PROPFIRST > shit about how your position works ? 
I love hanging out with my baby , :) good day . :]

People who sing < PROPFIRST > jacksons songs and seriously drag them down to hell and back and then back again , when the original was perfectly fine , should be shot .
