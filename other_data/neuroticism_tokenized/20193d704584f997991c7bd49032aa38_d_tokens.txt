Is wondering if I'm the victim of the evil genius or the evil genius himself ? 4 more days ... 
3 more days ... 
Oh great , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is dead . Now I have to listen to his worshipers whine for weeks on end . 
Well this has been a sub par awards show thus far . 
Now I remember why I stopped watching BET seven years ago . Pathetic ... 
\Bright moments ... bright moments always come back vivid ... \"" 
Stop buggin'! A brother said , \Dig him ? \ " I never dug him . He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him . " 
I Wonder why people feel the need to be so melodramatic ? Life IS suffering after all . 
\Why do people insist on creating things that will inevitably be destroyed ? Why do people cling to life knowing that they must someday die ? Knowing that none of it will have meant anything once they do ? \"" 
I beseech you , my brothers , remain faithful to the earth , and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes ! Poison-mixers are they , whether they know it or not . Despisers of life are they , decaying and poisoned themselves , of whom the earth is weary : so let them go . 
Time to get down to business ... 
\I teach you the Übermensch . Man is something that shall be overcome . What have you done to overcome him ? \"" 
Apparently my younger cousin is one of the best youth athletes in < PROPMALE > . 3 rushing touchdowns in a single game ? Congratulations , < PROPMALE > 
I came across a rather fascinating question , if God ( yes , Yahweh , the God of < PROPMALE > ) came to you and order you to kill one of your children would you go through with it ? Yes or no answers please . 
Humph , looks like the Camel managed to do it again ... 
When was the last time the Clowns won a home opener ? 
You can always count on Kanye to be an ass . 
Beyonce ... * yawn * 
The Camel is in the building ... 
Now that < PROPFIRST > S . Camel has wrapped up his performance I have the urge to bump Ether . 
It seems that the fallout from the Kanye Incident are causing some people to show their true colors . Some of the updates on Twitter are disgusting . 
I really hoped that < PROPFIRST > Swayze would pull through ... 
Buffalo chocked in epic fashion . Why didn't that moron take the knee ?!!?! 
Money Mayweather is an absolute beast ... 
FACEBOOK EXPERIMENT : If you are reading this , even if we don't speak often , post a comment of a memory of you and me . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status ; you'll be surprised what people remember about you ... 
Wonders why do people who have lived in < PROPMALE > their whole lives complain about the weather ? 
Could someone please explain < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s appeal to me ? 
Well the Americans are off to a splendid start in the Super Six Tournament ; one knock out and one robbery . 
This game is giving me bad flashbacks of the 2009 Eastern Conference Finals ... 
Unbelievable ... 
Turkey and Dressing : Complete . < PROPMALE > and Cheese : In Progress . 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone . 
Hmmm , they actually did it . I guess I can start calling them \the Browns\ " again ... " 
is listening to various renditions of < PROPFIRST > of the Bells in order to get into the Christmas spirit ... Christmas is here , bringing good cheer , to young and old , meek and the bold ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone , from Docta Claus to you . 
is trying to be the puppet that sees the strings . 
I think I'll keep it tame tonight . No drinking , no shooting pistols or shotguns ; I think I'll workout and reflect on the past year . Nothing beats a little introspection . Welp , happy New Heard everyone . 
Hmm , my phone isn't letting me send out texts , how annoying . \ 
\ 
P.S. Fuck Sprint . 
Hilarious . 
\B-b-but Doc 
This game is pure comedy . Win or lose , at least they contended in the other 15 games . To come out and give your zealous , rabid , fan base so poor of a performance ? Against your hated rivals ( yeah right , that rivalry went to Baltimore with your team) ? \ 
The Clowns are garbage through and through . < PROPMALE > , welcome to another decade of football irrelevance . 
is saying nothing has changed in 2010 . My goals are still the same , my dedication to them hasn't changed , and the world is still my petri dish . 
My Ravens are rolling . The Squellers , the Bungles , and the Clowns , not so much . 
Damn , Peyton Manning is a surgeon out there . One dimensional , but very effective . 
is wondering why Baltimore's offense is so woefully inept . 
Unbefuckinglievable ... 
How can a playoff caliber football team be so undisciplined !?! I don't have the words ! 
And my Ravens are done . Hopefully the Chargers knock these clowns out of the playoffs . 
And my fine is a whopping $95 . So much for \godless heathens\ " having no morals . * chuckle * " 
The Terminator has been terminated ... 
Just copped God of War III . Committing deicide is even more fun than i thought it would be . 
I thought the Hercules battle was epic , but Cronus ... damn ... 
Kratos just sent a message , via Zeus , to deadbeat dads everywhere . 
So Obama kept his word ... the ramifications of this decision should be interesting . 
is thinking about the human condition , specifically about the suffering we must endure , our endless quest to alleviate it , and how we all struggle to make sense of the seemingly absurd world that we live in . I know I don't say this too often , but I feel the need to thank my friends and family for making life worth liviing ; I truly do love you all ( even if I have an odd way of showing it at times ) . 
Shaq's back !!! 
Maybe next season < PROPMALE > will be more humble when speaking to his superiors . 
Good start , Game 2 Monday at 8 . Time for Bucks/Hawks . 
Happy Earth Day , everyone . 
Welp , time to put the broom back in the closet . SMH 
Nice to see the Cavs plaing like a number one seeded team again . 
Hmmm , the Cavs are actually allowing Chicago to make this a game ... 
I'm disappointed in how close this game is , considering the Bulls have been playing 5 on 8 tonight . 
The cutest little kitten has decided to hide out in our garage , but we really don't know what to do with him . Decisions , decisions ... 
Okay , my last status update just disappeared . Facebook has been trippin ' all week . 
I bet he thinks twice about going in the paint now ... 
And that's game . 1-0 . 
With the Cavs smoking the Geriatrics and Money Mayweather styling on Old Man Mosley , I have to say that I'm a pretty satisfied sports fan . 
Happy Mother's Day , everyone . 
Nash is too cold . \ 
Killing the Spurs with one eye ?? Really ?!? The Cavs may have lost \ 
today , but at least the Suns have finally gotten a little\ 
payback against the Spurs . 
I am highly annoyed right now . Well if these bums blow this series , at least I have my Suns out West . 
Hahaha ... why did I do it to myself again ? Why did I put my faith in a team from a city that seems to pride itself on choking in < PROPMALE > moments ? Never again ... never again ... Fuck . My . Life . 
Worthless piles of excrement ... useless wastes of life ... 
I do the recruiting , I tutor the students , I\ 
nurture their brains , I'm moving the movement . 
Well that's another 4.0 semester in the \ 
books . How should I reward myself ? I know , I'm about to take a nice , \ 
long nap . 
I bet they wish they kept Turkoglu now . 
Hmmm , sso the 2009-2010 Loston Geriatrics have decided to play like the 2008 World Champion Boston Celtics , eh ? If they manage to pull it off this year , I have a special profile picture for my big cousin , the Boston < PROPMALE > . 
And the Lake Show is closed . 
is attempting to fully embrace nothingness . 
I thought that the Lake Show would be open tonight , what happened ? 
Lucky sons of bitches .... 
Ahh , three flashing read lights , now my night is complete ! 
Almost time ... 
Sitting here think of my uncle < PROPFIRST > , my cousin < PROPFIRST > , and my good friend < PROPFIRST > Pendland . On a day reserved for paying respect to deceased veterans and loved ones , I will not mourn their deaths , but celebrate their lives and be thankful for the memories they left behind . \ 
That said , I will feast in their honor , because I have food , lots of food , I repeat , endless meat ( no Lion < PROPMALE > ) . 
And there goes homecourt . Boston takes this in 6 . 
DAMN IT !! 
Had a nice evening with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , her over-priced fruit bowl , and two prostitutes in front of Wal-Mart ( let's give those imaginations a workout , folks ) . 
Happy Father's Day , everyone . 
Fedor ... tapped ... 
Judging by the status updates , I'm was missing everyone's favorite knock off awards show . Well at least < PROPFIRST > gets to do his tribute this year . 
It's fight night . 
And Lesnar is still the champ . 
Apparently there are iphone applications designed to help Theists and Atheists debate each other . I guess it's to much to ask for people to understand their beliefs enough to defend them . 
You know , I was thinking about getting on here , dropping more f-bombs than < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and going into detail about how LeBron has been a petulant child during this whole process , but I think that I'll forgo all that and watch his reputation be crucified by all < PROPMALE > sports outlets . Ehh , on the bright side the Lakers won't be threepeating . 
Well , reading status updates for the past couple hours I have to say that I have been entertained . 
The\ 
trojan worm is spreading like wildfire on FaceBook !! It is called “koob\ 
face” . It will steal your info , invade your system and shut it down ! Do\ 
NOT open the link “Barack Obama < PROPMALE > Scandal” ! If “SmartGirl15” adds\ 
you , don’t accept it ; it is a virus .... If somebody on your list adds ... her , \ 
then ... you get the virus too !! Copy and paste to your wall !!! 
[ Like\ 
this status and I will do likes , dislikes , confessions , and \ 
impressions ! ]\ 
With my lack of popularity on here , I'll probably end up doing two of these at the most . 
I'll be COMPLETELY HONEST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS . You can ask me any question you like , my only rules is that THEY HAVE TO BE IN MY INBOX . You can ask me anything , I don't care how crazy you may think it is , you will have my full honesty . That said , I DARE ANY OF YOU TO PUT THIS AS YOUR STATUS . 
Went out with my confidant and old friend since the sandbox , < PROPFIRST > Murph , and had a pretty good time . I also saw some things that reminded me that there are still < PROPMALE > people out there . 
Well today went pretty well , I saw a few old friends and acquaintances , two of my favorite professors , and did a little recruiting for the Honors Program . The only thing that's killing my natural high is the fact that I lost my damned Honors Program Pin . I knew I shouldn't have worn it . 
I've really have been trying to change my view of online classes , but I have seen too much nonsense over the past week to soften my stance . 
After watching the documentary on Marjoe Gortner , I am reminded of how naive people can be . 
I guess I'll give this InDRUpendence Day ( horrible name , by the way ) a listen and see if these guys have still got it . 
I had a fascinating conversation with a good friend ; a conversation that makes me want to do a little introspection . 
Welp , my vacation is over . Time to get back to business doing what I do best . 
Back to business . 
The first day back wasn't too tough . Once I check out these last two classes , I'll start the process of annihilating this course load . 
Why do all the folks in my online course sound like a bunch of automatons ? I try to avoid forcing my views and beliefs on others , but everyone should be able to convey their personality through text . 
Today was pretty interesting ; I got to spend time with old friends , get better acquainted with new ones , and , oh yeah , I got to hear President Obama's speech today at Tri-C West . While I appreciated the opportunity , a part of me wishes that my spot would have gone to someone who would have appreciated the experience more . 
I feel like I have the weight of the world off of my shoulders ... now it's time to observe the fallout . 
< PROPMALE > almost caught another case tonight ... wonderful . 
Ah , I finally got my baby back . 
Laughable . 
Better , much better . 
There isn't a word in the English language that can adequately convey how much I hate the Pittsburgh Steelers . 
is in a < PROPFIRST > Osterman kind of mood today . I've got to shake myself out of this Nihilistic funk that I'm in . 
SEPTEMBER IS Cancer MONTH : In memory of every cancer patient , family member , and friend who has lost their battle with cancer , and in honor of those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for one hour if you love someone who has or had cancer .

I'm about to be sick . 
These idiots ... 
How did I let those assclowns convince me to watch this tripe ? 
The < PROPMALE > and Cheese is prepped , now all I have to do is bake it . 
I never thought Honor Students essential . They're crude and unspeakably plain , but maybe they have a glimmer of potential , if aligned with my vision and brain . \ 
Now to see how many of them get the joke without getting offended . 
The playlist for the evening ? Grand Theft Autumn , Unthinkable , Requiem Lacrimosa , Beauty , 10s , Intro ( DMX ) , The Beast . Talk about being on an emotional roller coaster . 
I'm not going to jinx it ... 
The Browns win the Battle of Ohio and the Ravens win the Battle of Defensive Juggernauts . This is shaping up to be the best week ever . 
Let's see who can fill in all of the blanks . \

Post this to your wall and see who knows you . 
Asher Brown , a 13 year old boy in Texas shot himself in the head after years of bullying and torment for being gay . < PROPMALE > Walsh < PROPMALE > himself from a backyard tree . < PROPFIRST > Clementi , 18 and a freshman at Rutgers , jumped off of the GW Bridge after his roommate broadcast a video of < PROPFIRST > with another man . Today , I STAND UP TO THOSE BULLIES in their honor . If you care STAND UP with me , please post this as your status . 
It feels pretty good to be a member of the Droid Army . 
What ? Sweetest Day ? Bah , humbug . 
Like this status and I will tell you :\ 
1 . Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 3 seconds . \ 
2 . The color you remind me of . \ 
3 . My favorite memory of you . \ 
4 . The animal you remind me of . \ 
5 . Ask you something that I've always wondered about you . \ 
6 . My favorite thing about you . \ 
7 . Give you a weird nickname . \ 
8 . What's on my MP3 player right now . \ 
9 . I challenge you to post this as your status . 
Welp , time to crush this Ethics midterm . 
At times I wonder if building friendships is worth the effort ? What's the point in letting your guard down and showing your true self when you will eventually be violated in some way ? It seems so much easier to be the leading man and weave intricate lies with the character that you portray . 
The NBA is back and the Heat are getting stomped out , I love it . 
They're actually doing it ... 
The Saints stomp out the Steelers on the < PROPFEMALE > of All Saints Day . What a lovely way to cap off an awesome weekend . Oh , did I mention that the Ravens take the number 1 spot in the AFC North via tiebreaker ? 
\Fame is a vapor ; popularity an accident ; the only earthly certainty is oblivion . \"" 
Tired , so very tired . 
Clevelanders whining about snow ? Ridiculous . 
The Browns crushed the Patriots and the Ravens continued to do what they do ? Man , the only thing that could make this football week any better is to see the Steelers get stomped out in another prime time game . 
Happy Veterans Day to all the vets and military personnel out there . 
After all my ranting about being the < PROPFEMALE > Übermensch , it seems that I am human , all too human . 
I am nurturing these seeds of discord so that they may one day sprout into chaos . 
I want to take this time to say that I am thankful for my wonderful family ( all of them ) , and my fantastic friends ( new and old ) . It is you guys who I draw strength from when I am at my lowest ; it is you guys that make life worth living . Thank you , everyone , and have a happy Thanksgiving . 
So Pittsburgh managed to survive against the worse team in the AFC ? Good . They have a week to celebrate before they're exposed . 
I'm pulling up various examples from my personal experience in order to reflect upon the human condition ; in particular , the nature of being and suffering . I'm trying to find the logic in it all , but I know that it will ultimately be a fruitless endeavour . While there isn't anything wrong with a little introspection , I wish that my mind would stop racing so I can to to sleep . 
It's going down ... 
This conscience of mine is becoming an inconvenience . It needs to be put down , I think . 
Pittsburgh's toughness , craftiness , and heart coupled with several blown opportunities by the Ravens and Flacco's incompetence lead to a come-from-behind victory by the Steelers . Congratulations on this win and , in all likelihood , the division , Pittsburgh . Now I have to prepare myself for the crow I have to feast on over the next week ( no , the irony of a Ravens fan eating crow doesn't escape me ) . 
Alright , I'm caving . Hit my inbox with a number and I'll give you my honest thoughts about you . 
#7 The 85 year old in the body of a twenty year old . Always fun to be around , and I get a good laugh every time I see you ( laughing both with you and at you ) . You really are a sweetheart , and your maternal nature truly does manage to warm my frozen heart . 
#25 My female best < PROPMALE > , little sister , confidant , and voice of reason when I lose my composure . What would I have done without you over these past few month ? You are one of the few people that I am able to completely drop my guard around , and for that , I am eternally grateful to have met you and to call you \friend\ " ( despite us bumping heads every once and a while ) . " 
#1337 I hate to sound pretentious , but you're one of the few people that I've met who I can have meaningful philosophical discussions with . Whether it be about Metaphysics , Ethics , or Epistomology , you are always able to give insightful opinions . And I'm still looking forward to that gaming tournament we are supposed to have over the Break . 
#13 The young prodigy from < PROPMALE > . One of the few relatives I have whom I can relate to . I look forward to the few times we do actually manage to see each other nowadays and look forward to our Monopoly games and trashtalk . This time around , I'll have a few tales of my own to tell . 
#1 How did I know you would go with this number ? Bluntly put , you are the personification of an internate troll ; you say the most outlandish shit in order to bring the worse out of people . You can be rude , crude , unrefined , and obnoxious , but behind that persona of yours , I think you are a cool dude if a little irrational at times . 
#90 You've been a cool , thoughtful , kind , considerate guy from the day I met you nearly ten years ago in Madam's French class . Despite the different world views we have nowadays , I still look forward to talking to you , and I want you to finally cop a damned PS3 or 360 , man . 
#69 My male best < PROPMALE > and little brother from another mother . It's been a pleasure knowing you for all of these years and exchanging ideas , and there is no one I would rather play against in whatever new fighter hits the market . While I've prided myself on being your confidant and rock when you need one , I may be needing you to return the favor soon . 
#5 The bright young lady who wears black even more than I do . I really enjoyed working with you in English 1010 , and I respect the fact that you stayed in the trenches with me until the end . Judging by your status updates , you're as witty as ever , but Im still waiting on you to join the Honors Program . 
You can't be serious ... 
I never thought honors students essential . They're crude and unspeakably plan , but maybe they have a glimmer of potential if aligned to my vision and brain ... 
All A's and one B ... I am not pleased ... 
Christmas ? Bah , humbug . 
Why are < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > A . Bernatowicz such haters ? What have the Ravens ever done to you two besides provide you quality entertainment ? 
Wow , this certainly feels different ... 
You and I wake up to the zombie apocalypse . Using only 4 words , what would you say to me . Note : if you comment you must copy and paste to your status so I can comment on yours . 
The Mad Doctopian is back with a modified paradigm for 2011 . 
Apologies for my tardiness , I was trolling some Squealers fans . With the most dominant performance of the 2011 NFL Playoffs thus far , the Ravens move on to meet the Squealers in the nation's septic tank . \ 
One more bump in the road before the Ravens advance to the AFC Championship to face the Patriots . Go Ravens ! 
Alright , I'll give this Skype thing a try . \ 
The_Mad_Doctopian 
The refs are at it already , I see . 
Steelers Nation is looking like Belgium circa 1940 right now . Bada ba ba ba , Doc's loving it . 
I want Flacco and < PROPFIRST>'s heads after this game , win or lose . 
I hate the Steelers , but I loath , detest , and despise < PROPFIRST > Flacco . The < PROPFEMALE > choke again , a-fucking-gain . That's okay though , they will lose in spectacular fashion next weekend against the Patriots . 
I'm still furious . I want to strangle that swaggerless bum Flacco and that moron Can < PROPFIRST > . How in the hell can you not find someway to utilize the number of weapons that they have on offense ? 
I'm being forced to root for the Jets ? Really ? What a revolting development this is ... 
Let's get this shit over with ... 
Pathetic ... 
How did these clowns make it this far ? They are who I thought they were . 
This drive looks promising already . 
Hmmm , let's see where this goes ... 
< PROPFIRST > Rodgers , you're my only hope . 
I petitioned to graduate this morning , and while I am appreciative of the knowledge I've acquired over the past three years , I appreciate the friends that I have made far more . School has always come easy to me , but the friends I have made since going back to school have forced me to change , to evolve as a person , and I can't thank them enough for that . 
\I know that if the universe is meaningless ... that's a joke at our expense . If it's meaningful ... a different joke . Any meaning we make ourselves----that's us pretending that we're in on it . \"" 
\The greatest snare in human thought is unconditional acceptance of irrational assumptions . \ " - Will Durant " 
An ice day ? Imagine that . 
Business is picking up in Cairo . 
Damn . Better luck next game , Cavs . 
* chuckle * 
Black and yellow , black and yellow ... 
Excellent half of football , Steelers . You guys just a have to climb one more step before you get 7 . Come on , you can do it ! 
A little breathing room ... 
It was almost worth Baltimore losing to see these chumps blow it here . Steelers Nation looks like Hiroshima in late 1945 , and I'm loving it . Oh , it's Häagan Dazs !!! 
Pittsburgh Steelers , congratulations on winning your seventh Superbowl Championship ... wait , they lost ? Seriously ? So their front running fan base looks like a pack of ass clown who didn't hop off the bandwagon before it crashed ? Word ? Looks like I'll be drunk off of salty tears tomorrow . 
I hope that all females in the Dallas-Fort Worth area between the ages of 12 and 18 are okay this morning . Hopefully , < PROPMALE > didn't try to compensate for his impotency as a QB at their expense . 
Cavs win ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day ? Bah , humbug . 
The Rock ... 
World Champs , huh ? And a < PROPMALE > team comes through with another upset . 
The Sunset Limited is a damned good movie . 
Did this cat really just walk into the Falafel Cafe and ask if they sold falafel ? Really ? Word ?!? 
Well catching the flu certainly wasn't a part of my plans . So much for studying and finishing these college applications . 
Doc vs the Flu : Day 5 . \ 
I could deal with being sick over the weekend , but now it's forcing me to miss class . 
Winning ! 
New look Knicks , huh ? In the words of Yipes !, \Fuck the Knicks ! \"" 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , if you are being a bitch or bastard , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They know who they are . 
Man , I feel burned out ; Spring Break wasn't nearly long enough . Oh well , I should sleep well tonight . 
That win has been a long time coming . 
Loving this weather . 
Now all I have to do is bake it ... 
Spending this Good Friday night cleaning up and watching the Sunset Limited . 
Wow ! The Spurs refuse to lay down . 
Damn ... 
Bin Laden dead ?!? WOW ! 
Hmm , Finals Week is quickly approaching . I guess it's time I stopped messing around and got on my Cain Marko shit ( I wonder if anyone will get the reference ) . 
So much for that threepeat . Better luck next year , Hobe . 
interrupts the completion of his research papers to bring you this public service announcement :\ 
Hobe and the Lakers are over , done , through , finished ! Let me get my broom ready for these bums ! 
Wow ! These clowns true colors are showing . 
Ahh , what a fantastic day ! I get to serve Lakers fans crow and humble pie and it feels great . This whooping has been a long time coming . 
I've reached the end of the road . Time to dumb out on these finals and presentations ( no , the irony doesn't escape me ) . 
Crushed two finals today . Two more tomorrow and I'm done . 
19 
21 
23 !!!! 
To all those concerned , you can view your grades if you run a DARs ... knowing how thirsty some of you are , I'm probably not telling you anything that you don't already know . 
4.0 ... winning ! 
Working like a slave of both the house and field variety . This is supposed to be my graduation day , right ? 
Just received my ... degree holding case ... yeah ... 
Yesterday's and last night were great ways to cap off a fantastic week . I have to say that I'm feeling pretty good . 
Yesterday and last night were great ways to cap off a fantastic week . I have to say that I'm feeling pretty good . 
And the Basketball Voltron pulls off another win . How impressive ... 
Dammit . Oh well , overtime . 
< PROPFEMALE > is too tired ... 
Well , looks like it will be a rematch of the 06 Finals . 
And the 2011 NBA Finals teams are set . Will < PROPMALE > have his revenge ? 
I hate to admit it , but this three-headed monster is a problem . 
D . Wade taking souls like Shang Taunt ... dammit , it was inevitable . 
And we have ourselves a series . 
No matter who wins , this series is fantastic . 
Is anyone at Metro Campus at the moment ? 
I know I'm a bit late , but to the Bridges folks : Don't forget to read the Health Disparities article on Blackboard and post a question on the discussion board . 
Best two out of three ... 
Mavs win , about a sixth of my friends list shows me love , and I've been accepted into Baldwin-Wallace . This just might be the best birthday ever . 
Watch < PROPFIRST > bust their asses ! 
Impressive , Miami , impressive . 
< PROPMALE>'s Revenge ... it would be nice if he didn't look worse than Kobe did in the last game of last year's Finals though . 
The < PROPMALE > is dead . Long live the < PROPMALE > . Wait , LeBron never was the < PROPMALE > , but he can kneel and kiss < PROPMALE>'s ring anyway . 
To all fans of that court jester who were too broke to relocate with him :\ 
I will be verbally and textually lighting you clowns up for the next week . That is all . 
“Even though we've changed and we're all finding our own place in the world , we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face , we'll come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us , nothing will ever change so much to the point where we're not all still friends . ” 
Happy Fathers Day , gentlemen . 
Some of these status updates are both sad and amusing . I respect a person's right to express their feelings , but why so much negativity ? I understand that many of you're situations are or weren't ideal , but why not celebrate the men who take their businesses without the unnecessary qualifiers ? Why can't it be about the aforementioned men instead of your negative experiences ? Pure egoism ... 
I got the letter T , something ( someone ) I like : Thanos of Titan , something ( someone ) I dislike : Target , something ( someone ) I love : Thunderstorms . Like my status for a letter . 
\I seek to understand out of what idiosyncrasy that Socratic equation reason = virtue = happiness derives : that bizarrest of equations and one which has in particular all the instincts of the older Hellenes against it\ " -- Nietzsche " 
Ahh , destitute no longer . 
Magneto is right . Always has been , and always will be . 
Well , that was a disappointing boxing match . 
X-Men the Animated Series is on Netflix . My day has been made . Now it's time to go watch Apocalypse flow straight from the Survival Scrolls . 
Ah , payday ... 
I just found out that I got accepted to Case ( better late than never , I suppose ); that was the easy part . Figuring out how to pay for it is the challenge . 
Over the years , I have developed the bad habit of falling out of touch with my friends once I reach certain milestones and/or move on to other places . It's about time I made a genuine effort to change that . After this research symposium is over , I'm dedicating the rest of the Summer to hanging out and catching up with my friends both old and new . 
It's finally over . 
Flight from Death : The Quest for Immortality is a pretty good documentary . It makes me want to look into the work of Dr. < PROPMALE > Yalom a lot more too . Maybe I should really consider marrying my two academic passions ( double entendre ftw ) . 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > Miller , better luck next time . 
Kids with special needs aren't weird or odd . They only want what everyone wants -- to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 30 minutess ? This is in honor of all children who were born unique . 
Meatless Mondays ? 
Oy , I feel like hammered crap . Oh , well , no sense in dwelling on that ; it is a new day with new possibilities .
