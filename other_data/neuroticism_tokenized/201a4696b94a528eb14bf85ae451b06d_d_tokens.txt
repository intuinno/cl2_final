I don't know what I want to do anymore . If anyone knows a good college around here that has web design courses/majors , please tell me . I know Northwest has cosmetology , but so far that's my ONLY option and I really want some more to choose from ... 
About to make a random website with the Dreamweaver CS5 trial . I've never used Dreamweaver before ... so I hope this turns out okay . If not it's back to notepad and paintshop pro for me . =3 
... we were on the kisscam at the hockey game ... hehe <3 . I hate you mom . <3 jk 
Making chicken spaghetti tonight . Sad day tomorrow . =( 
Zombies , Zombies , Zombies ... 
=( 
saw < PROPMALE > off at the airport ... I wish he didn't have to go ... 
Anyone know about Full Sail University ? I'm thinking about their web design program , but i'm wondering if it's worth it ... 
The more I read up on full sail's web design program , the more I feel that I'll love it . I'd learn computer graphics , flash animation , psychology of human interaction , programming languages , and ( of course ) web design and management . The reviews are great . The only negative things i've heard about it are the prices ... which only means i gotta work on finding some scholarships . =3 
Cleaning my room is a more complex task than i originally thought it would be . On the bright side , my bed is almost clear of clothes and clutter , and a garbage bag is almost full of clothes to give to goodwill . =3 
So tired .... and hungry ..... 
just managed to put my ipod in service mode ... or , as < PROPFIRST > called it , the black screen of death . he's working on fixing it . x.x 
I feel ... so bad ... I do think I have a cold and not allergies . > < 
Lovin ' these superbowl commercials . GO PACKERS ! <3 
Nice first half . =3 
Owl City is flooding my facebook news feed with Lord of the Rings based status updates . <3 This is great . 
My head hurts so bad ... but this is such a good game . Lovin ' the Packers ! <3 
YES ! PACKERS WIN ! <3 
Amazing game . Took some Nyquil . Gonna talk with my amazing boyfriend and watch Glee . Then to bed . =3 
Sniffles and headaches . Ugh . Maybe I can find some scholarship info today at least ... i hope ... -.- 
HUNGRYYYYYYYYYY T_T 
Snow ! LOTS OF SNOW ! YES ~ 
So much snow ! It's amazingly beautiful and quiet . Love it <3 
Everyone's talking about snow cream . I want some . I haven't had any in years . 
is about to flood FB with gaia avatar update things . Sorry about this ... 
MOM GOT GIRL SCOUT COOKIES ! OMG ! <3 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day everyone 
There's an otaku on \Made\ " right now . She's being made into a prom queen ... but she's wearing an Akatsuki cloak and a < PROPFEMALE > hat ... This is great . " 
Sean : * imitating GLaDOS * \You will be bakate and the ... wait .... you will be baked and then there will be cake \"" 
I hate it when I go to sleep ... then wake up ... then can't go back to sleep no matter how much I try ... 
Today is my amazing mom , < PROPFEMALE > Whittaker Toomey's , birthday ! I love you mommy-boo ! Happy Birthday ! <3 
Searching for scholarships and grants . Ugh . At least I found 2 last night that I can get for being in the web design field . 
feels really sick again . Up all night wanting to puke . Need 7up ... and gatorade ... 
just got back from shopping with < PROPFEMALE > . <3 glad I got to feeling a bit better so I could see her . 
lord of the rings <3 
My Fair Lady <3 looove this movie 
I'm so gonna download the Dragon Age 2 Demo at midnight . So excited . =3 
Dragon Age 2 ... is ... so epic ... 
Our oven is finally fixed thanks to my amazing dad , < PROPFIRST > Toomey ! Mom's making taco ring for the first time in a year ! 
... I wake up this morning\ 
and < PROPFIRST>'s walking through the hall\ 
With a cowboy hat on ... and his pants pulled up\ 
saying \I do declare ... well 
so ... my skype just turned to Japanese ... idk why 
Doesn't like this 
GLaDOS:I've learned a lot about humans since monitoring your \twitter\ " . For instance 
why , stomach ? why ? 
Sometimes I really worry about my mom , < PROPFEMALE > Whittaker Toomey . 
well ... my laptop is officially dead . the hinge in the screen broke and now the display won't even turn on . 
Has a temporary solution ! I got a VGA cable and hooked the remains of my laptop to my tv , got a usb extender for my wireless mouse , and < PROPFIRST > lent me his wireless keyboard until I can get one for under $20 . So , my tv is now a super awesome tv/computer hybrid . Creative solutions ftw . 
Benadryl is crazy stuff . I took some last night around 11 , fell asleep , woke up at 2 , fell back asleep , woke up at 5 , fell back asleep , kept waking up at random intervals to text messages from my boyfriend , and finally seriously woke up at noon . > < I feel like I've wasted my day ... but on the bright side , my eyes aren't itchy and my nose isn't stuffy . 
I guess I'm going to the doctor tomorrow . I'm pretty sure this junk is a sinus infection tho . -.- Ugh ... I can't stand going to the doctor . 
Feels a bit better today . Probably because i slept well and didn't wake up at 2 or 5 . I was supposed to go to the doctor , but I think mom forgot . Oh well , I don't think I have anything that benadryl or dayquil can't fix . 
Really really craving some Newk's lobster cheese soup ... or sushi ... or any kind of non-fried fish for that matter . 
So , < PROPFIRST > made some of that Boston Market meatloaf and potatoes that mom accidentally bought instead of salisbury steak the other day . He said it was really good and let me have a taste . No more Stouffer's meatloaf for me . This stuff is amazing . 
So , I have an elevated heartrate due to dehydration ... and sinuses ... got a shot and gotta get another tomorrow ... also have to take antibiotics 
and they just played vienna teng in walgreens . omgggg 
just finished up \Lucky Star\ " . Now I gotta find another anime to watch ... " 
I didn't know drinking a bottle of gatorade could be so difficult . I can't even get halfway through it . And I'm sposed to drink 3 a day ?! -.- 
WOO ! Finished a gatorade ~ ! 
Also , all the people i called this morning or sent phone number requests to ( Jahn Gude , < PROPFEMALE > Hinson , < PROPFEMALE > Cuevas , etc . ) please ignore them . My hand hit my phone this morning as I was sleeping and pushed a bunch of buttons on my screen . Forgive me . T_T 
just got out of the doctor again . antibiotic shot ftw . ... not really . it hurts . x.x 
? We're no strangers to loooove ... 
just finished some toast and took my medicine . took me a while to finish the toast , but I did it . 
LOL ! < PROPFIRST > is so hyper he ran in here to tell me something , slid and missed my door , and in the process of trying to turn around and run back to my door , slipped and fell on his face . we both had a good laugh . too funny . 
i hate this medicine . it seems its making me more sick than i was to begin with . guess this just means i need to eat more ... blahhhh 
\I didn't lose . I was semi-victorious ! \"" 
Monday needs to get here already . I'm sick of being sick and sick of this medicine . -.- 
Starting to feel alot better . Can't wait till i don't have to take this medicine anymore . 
... so the entertainment for the day is mom and < PROPFIRST > putting their iPhone voice changer things together and having them scream at each other in high pitched voices ... 
Hopes to see < PROPFEMALE > Makel < PROPMALE > soon . I miss her like crazy . 
It REALLY stinks when there's someone who wants a website , money is involved , and I have the creative ability to make an AMAZING website for this guy , but there's two problems : I have very little knowledge about how to make flash animations and elements , and I have neither the software to make said flash animations nor the software to create the actual website that can support all the things he wants . 
going to the zoo today . Gonna be fun ! 
had so much fun with < PROPFEMALE > Makel < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Turpin , and < PROPFIRST > at the zoo ! Glad I got to go even tho I felt like I was being a downer the entire time . X3 
You learn something new every day . 
has the worst headache ever . x.x 
Ok , so I RSVP'd for TigerCon ! I included < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > in my party . So you guys , don't worry about RSVPing . X3
