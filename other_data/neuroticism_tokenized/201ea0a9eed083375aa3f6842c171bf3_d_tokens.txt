ahhhhhhh ...... I seem to have some form of insomnia . O.O I have been awake for 20 hours ...... and am not tired or sleepy ...... strange , ne ? 

just thinking . gonna try to get on here more often 
looking for a good book to read for awhile . 
found a good book , now I will be detained for a few days . 
is trying to figure some stuff out . I haven't had a thinking session like this in a while . 
Is on hour 19 of my internal clock reset . I've been on the 5am to 3pm routine for a week or so now , and I need to reset before I have to get up for work again . 
Happy new year , I hope everyone has a better year this year than they had last year . 
It's cold as the gobi in my room today . 
Just got back from Louisville , Kentucky . Insanly long ride to pick up a few pieces of equipment . 45 minutes of work , 17 and a half hours of driving over two days . It was pretty good stuff though , 8 servers , 2 batteries ( 150 pound ones ) , and 2 power connectors . Plus all the racks and misc . stuff that goes with them . 
is very bored . 
Going to have surgery two weeks from today 
I'm laying out under the stars tonight . I haven't decided if I'm gonna sleep out here , but it is very tempting . 
Went by north < PROPFEMALE > tech today . Gonna see if I can get in , they might not want some old fool like me to attend . 
Watching the 5th nightmare on elm street movie . I need some good dreams . 
Just started number 6 . Hope this one is a little more .... exciting , they can't expect me to have good dreams with that sad performance . 
Nightmare on elm street 6 was pretty funny actually . I guess in gonna have to find another movie to turn to for good dreams . Any suggestions ? 
home from the hospital , surgery went fine . 
Only ended up with 4 stiches . Amazing how small they can make cuts for surgery now . 
Arm is healing pretty well . I imagine that they could take the stitches out in a few days if they wanted . 
About a week with less than normal to almost no pain sounds pretty good ... til the pain comes back . You almost get use to waking up with out pain every morning , and when it does come back , it feels worse than you remember , even though in you mind you know it's the same . 
Got my stitches out today . 
4 more days till I get to see my favorite short person . 
Arranging furniture today ..... Oh joy . 
I hate being old . 
Just got home after meeting my long lost older brother , and yeah you heard that right , he is one of the few people that I acknowledge as my elder . We are close in age , but he has a little more time served than I do . 
By the law of history , the victorious are always the rightious , and the failed are always the wicked . 
Just looked over the material I need to know to take the entrance exam for the course I'm taking ..... I need to go study , it's been a loooooong time since I have even looked at an algebra problem , much less solve one . 
Quick someone ask me a moderately challenging algebra question to see if I understand this junk . ( that last word was nicer than the one that crossed my mind ) 
Ok I've figured out polynomials pretty much , now on to linear equatins with two variables . 
I seriously need to stop staying up like this . 
Is like bath water , it can be hot , warm , or cold , but no matter what , it always ends up down the drain . A para- quote by the great philosopher dixius of the land of < PROPFIRST > . 
Sitting in dixies house chillin with ghosts . 
I hope everyone had a great Halloween , and I hope you all have a perfect all saints day tomorrow . 
GO VOTE !!! If you don't vote , don't you dare say one word to me about the situation this country is in . This is a republic , we the people are the ones that control what goes on . If you don't like it , vote for someone that will fix it , if you don't know who wants to fix it , do some research . 
This is more important than dancing with the stars , it's more important than jersey shore , it's more important than soap operas , and it's more important than a sports team . If you can know the life story of all of those people , you can dang well read a little about the people making laws in this country . 
Back to my home in < PROPMALE > . 
I'm so tired I could sleep for weeks 
:O it's snowing !!!!!!!!! 
I'm completely uninterested in football , but I have to say I'm sooooo happy LSU beat Alabama . There are a group of people in my family that love Alabama way to much , and have been almost unbearable with their prasie of the tides performance this season . No one should get that into a team , and now that they got beat , maybe a little humility will be seen among the masses . 
It's colder than a water buffalo's hindquarters in the winter up here . 
Still chilly here . If this is any sign of the future , there could be a blizzard this year . ( crosses fingers ) 
Sitting in front of mcdonalds . < PROPMALE > is a much longer walk from my house than it appears . 
7 and a half < PROPMALE > in 2 hours and 45 minutes . Go me !! 
Good night everyone . Have good dreams . 
I hate daylight savings time . And to make it worse , my baby's sick . 
Come take a drink and drown your sorrows , and all of our fears will be gone til the marrow . Everyone should go listen to alestorm . It's pirate metal , how awesome is that ?!?! 
The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity ...... but not in that order . 
I have an algebra test tomorrow , but that's ok cause zach is going to go take it for me . 
< PROPFEMALE > , that was the worse test ever . It's also the lowest score I ever made on a test . Oh the humanity . 
Gotta work tomorrow and Saturday . Oh what a fun week I'm having . 
Night , gonna go to sleep ..... 5:00 comes early . 
Goodnight again peoples , 5 comes early tomorrow too . 
So tired .... 
Ahhh that was a nice nap . 
Just finished watching an anime ...... um ..... It was good ..... but ..... my mind is now fried . I'm not sure if I'm just out of practice watching anime , or if this one was just on of the super mind crushing ones , but whatever the cause , 11 eyes gets a 10 out of 10 in the brain scrambling catagory . 
At home after vist the family day . Half my family didn't want me to go home haha . 
I love to sleep . It really is the best of both worlds . You get to be alive and unconscious . 
Few people will understand this but .... We just one shotted every boss in icc up to the lich < PROPMALE > , we are on our 12th atempt . So far the valkrs are killing us . Everyone seems in for the long haul , might get the < PROPMALE > slayer title tonight . 
\my cookie\ " \ 
Me in the morning\ 
\ 
? (???) \ 
Good Morning !? 
It's almost thanksgiving . Don't forget to tell everyone you love that your thankful for them being in your life . 
I'm thankful for a family that didn't have to love me but did anyway . I'm thankful for the friends I've made over the years , because they are amongst the greatest people to ever walk the earth . I'm thankful for the time I spent with an angel trapped in a frail body . I'm thankful that even though my body has problems , my mind is strong . 
Wow , warlocks got stomped in this patch . Every single damaging spell we have was reduced by 12% . That's insane . 
Today is the day that we look back over the year and remember the great times we've had . No matter how hard it has been , we have all had at least a few moments that make us certain life is worth living . 
Home from thanksgiving , had a pretty good time , missed some people , but got to see some others . All and all it was a nice day today . 
Back at the house from dixies . Now I am going to go ahead and allow the turkey-induced coma to take affect . 
It's 36 degrees and droping . Oh sweet winter , how I've missed thee , please come swiftly and < PROPMALE > your herald a reason to keep spreading your praises . 
O.O . New pirates of the carribean movie comes out soon . 
You can have a skittle , a mento , or a sweet tart . \ 
It ain't no riddle , you don't need an id card . \ 
It's not illegal , it might give you some cavities . \ 
It's kind of little , I'll take a handful if you please . 
27 degrees right this very moment . 
For some reason my text program isn't working . 
Text program working again , I think . 
Work again tomorrow 
Ahhhh , I love pain free mornings . 
Does it make me a bad person if I like to shot people right as they think they are safe and under cover ? What about if I like to hit people in the head with a 5 foot long ax with a 4 foot width ? 
Lunar eclipse tonight at around 2:30 on the east coast . be sure to watch it if you're going to be awake . last one for 3 years 
I got a haircut and shaved today ...... I guess 2 times a year isn't bad . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . Remember , it's not about the presents , it's about the people and the memories . If this Christmas isn't quite as grand as you wished , just remember the ones before , and all the fun and happiness from the years gone by . I wish everyone the very best in the upcoming year . May we all be happy and feel love unconditional this year . 
Omg , a white Christmas in < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! The insanity !!!! The humanity !!!! The ...... Well you get the idea . 
So yeah , 3 books are 248 dollars . I have a lot of reading to do . 
I never count on yesterday , because the past may not exsist . I'll never give myself away , when there's reason to resist . Words draped in < PROPFEMALE > melt away . I .... miss you . Outside the snow keeps falling , if you're cold then I'll come calling . 
Night everyone , have good dreams . 
It seems I have a one sided relationship going on here . I sing praises and show love , and all I get in return is a cold ache . 
Aladdin is on !!!! amazing what you find when you turn a tv on . 
School starts tomorrow , provided they don't close because of the snow 
One love , one heart , let's get together and feel alright . 
Oh the humanity !!!! School has been called for snow , and yet I have homework to do none the less . This would be ok ..... If it wasn't for the fact that I've never met my teacher , and have never been to the classroom . 
Night my little snow birds . 
Well , just did all my homework for school . A short report , 3 quizes , and a test . \ 
Sadly I missed a question on the test . \

Two hours to study before my test . Hope everyone has fun today , I know I will . 
Just got done with my test , waiting for everyone else to finish . 
Muhahahaha , like the challenge this time ? I'm gonna relax for a while . I have a feeling that this one will be well worth those extra points . 
no one has even tried a guess on the current challenge . Looks like I did a good job this time . 
Muhahaha , you see on all previous mythology challenges , the pictures have had rather large clues contained within the pictures . This allowed for people to use the Internet and look up the beings using those clues . 
How's everyone's endoplasmic reticulum today ? 
HA !!!!!! we have a correct answer to the challenge . I'm not telling anyone who it is , cause I don't want anyone getting the answer from them . ;) 
I wonder who will be the next to answer correctly ........ 
Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are . 
I'm very happy today . I've made several new friends . They live in my head , so they come around alot . :D 
The tables have turned , And I’ve finally learned , \ 
that this is makin ' up for every day I was gone . \ 
And that’s why I’m concerned , But now it’s confirmed , \ 
that you spread your wings and learned to fly all alone 
I dream of a day , when white boys can dance around the house , the town , and the store without having their motives questioned . 
Ok , if no one else gets the answer to the mythology challenge before thursday , I'm gonna give everyone a hint . After i give the hint , points for correct answers will be reduced by 50% . Thats still 2500 points for second place . In case you're wondering . 
Algebra is ....... Draining . 
Has a LOT of homework . 
Goodnight friends . I bid thee safe travels along the shores of your dreams . 
Consider me tired . 
People at this place live off of hamburger and pizza combos . 
?????????? ??????? ( having preposition issues ) 
Here is your hint for the challenge . \ 
( Middle east ) good luck to you . \ 
On a seperate note , ?????????? ??????? 
No new answers even with last nights hint . How disappointing . :-/\ 
P.s. ??????????? ??????? 
Still no new answers for the challenge . if no one gets it by thursday , i'll give another hint , and lower the points again . \ 
P.S. ??????????????????? 
2 nights in a row ... I hope this stops before tomorrow . I cant handle 12 hour work days with 2 hours sleep . 
I'm thinkin ' I might have to go to the doctor soon . 3 days is to long and it's a little closer to my spine than I like . 
??????????????????? 
Benedryl before test day at school is not advisable . 
The doctor thinks I'm allergic to almonds . If I am I'm highly allergic . I look like I've < PROPFEMALE > n playing soccer with a < PROPFEMALE > hive full of soccer hating < PROPFEMALE > s . 
This will be your final hint , after saturday the points will keep going down by 100 until 3 more people get it . \ 
( old , middle eastern , order ) 
Awww , still no new answers . Everyone wanted harder questions , but when I put a decent one up , no one wanted to play anymore . :( 
last < PROPMALE > to find an answer for the challenge , when I log on tomorrow i'm changing it . oyasuminasai . 
New mythology challenge is up . Get to work . 
One day ...... \ 
Humans will remember the terror of their ancesters as they walk alone in the woods . \ 
One day ....... \ 
Humans will be reinformed of their place in the world . \ 
At least I hope so . Humans have become far to complacent in their own power . 
The next challenge is up , have fun . 
Ok so I'm sitting by the window at mountain lakes clubhouse , and as always , there are 2000 lady bugs all around the window . I've noticed that the ones that are more red tend to be nervous around movement , but the orange ones tend to be more curious . 
Well , I survived the math test , but just barely . It's gonna be a tough night in the ICU , but I should pull through in the end . Night everyone , I need my rest for the recovery . \ 
P.s. The new challenge is up , get to work ya lazy no good ...... Wonderful lovely people . :) 
I had an anatomy and physiology test today . It wasn't nearly as draining as math , plus I made a 96 , so I feel much better today . \ 
Still have some complacations from the math test , but I've been moved out of icu , into general population . 
Night peoples . Tomorrow is a loooong day . Get to work on the challenge . 
Good night my friends . May you have wonderful dreams , and glorious awakenings . 
Good morning , I trust everyone had a wonderful night , and I'm sure you will each have a great day .

Heaven just isn't hot enough , burn me alive inside . Living my life's not hard enough , take everything away . 
Does anyone know if something really bad happened yesterday around 3:30 ? 
There were several attacks and deaths throughout the world Sunday , but nothing that I would normally feel such strong empathy for . The search continues . 
I love Tuesdays . 
Research project on 8 different diseases , 30 math problems , 3 homework pages , and 2 tests . All due on Monday ........ How is everyone else's weekend looking ? 
Knowledge is the amount power someone has , imagination is the ability to focus that power , and wisdom is the application of power . 
To shave or not to shave ..... 
Remember when we'd . \ 
Stay up late and we'd talk all night . \ 
In a dark room lit by the tv light . \ 
Through all the hard times in my life . \ 
Those nights kept me alive . \ 
We'd listen to the radio play all night . \ 
Didn't want to go home to another fight . \ 
Through all the hard times in my life . \ 
Those nights kept me alive . 
Goodnight , enjoy your dreams . 
Lol . The government is so funny . 
Packing . Oh the fun . 
Good night brothers sisters and children , have sweet dreams and beautiful awakenings . 
Yay for coffe drinkers . coffee is good for you . :D Well .... that is until they do the next study ...... but until then drink away ! ( suggested daily dose : 2 cups caffinated , 3 cups uncaffinated ) 
Goodnight angels , demons , warlords , mages , ninjas , death knights , and dragons . I know it's hard sometimes , but don't let the humans annoy you . They aren't worth your time . 
It's official , my new hair style will be a darker version of battousai's . 
Jeeze , moving is a pain , plus there is no Internet yet . -_- \ 
I must have a talk with these people . Having the tv turned on before the Internet is blasphemy . \ 
Tv isn't important in the least . 
Well , at least the school's Internet works . 
Has found a book that is probably the single best fantasy novel he has ever read . 
Does anyone have any anime suggestions ? I had a list of ones I wanted to watch , but I seem to have lost it . 
Have you ever put on a certain item of clothing and found that it changes your mood completely ? 
I have to finals tomorrow , one will be cake , the other will be ..... we'll see . \ 
Good night everyone . \ 
Peace be tha journey .

What is ATP ? 
Haha , I made 103 on my anatomy final . 
Good night brothers , sisters , and friends . \ 
May your dreams be sweet and your mornings gental . 
If mars had an earthquake , would you call it a marsquake ? When lightning strikes the ocean , why don't all the fish die ? Can you cry underewater ? Does the mailman deliver his own mail ? Why is there a light in the fridge , but not the freezer ? 
I have the worst craving to go play WoW . Jeeze , you'd think after 3 months it would be out of my system . \ 
I need to go to the book store . Fantasy books are to WoW , as methadone is to heroine .

For future referance , knives are sharp . 
Ask not what your country can do for you .... \ 
Can you believe that the person that spoke those words was one of the most loved presidents ever ? \ 
If a president spoke those words today he would be impeached within 2 months . \ 
When did the American people come to love an all powerful government ? \ 
Isn't that why we broke away from the < PROPMALE > of England and formed this country to begin with ? 
Heh heh , guess who has a 4.0 GPA ?

All is well , no permenant injuries 
Wishes he still remembered all his dueling ninja formulas 
Night peoples . Peace be tha journey . 
What did I do to deserve such a wonderful weekend ? \ 
Two days of rain ending in a thunderstorm ? \ 
I love it . 
Good evening friends , how is the road treating y'all . 
Goodnight people , sleep well , have dreams that make you never want to wake up , and when you do wake up , have the memory of that dream < PROPFEMALE > you through any hardships you may face . 
Night peoples .
