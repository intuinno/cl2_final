I am vegetarian . I want everyone to know . So there ya go . 
Watching Jurassic Park . This movie is still awesome 20 years later . 
Today I saw a completely hot pink car , complete with pink headlights . 
Today at my guitar lesson , I somehow managed to hurt my wrist , get a blister on the tip of my finger , and make my arm sore . 
Another bad day . And still time for it to get worse . 
There are few people who I don't know very well , but I know are awesome . And those people are Isik Benson , Brooklynn Adams and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > .

Today I got an ugly reminder of the bad side of summer , a sunburn . 
If it keeps on rainin ' the levee's going to break .

Manchester Orchestra ! 
Of course the one wednesday < PROPFEMALE > doesn't need to use the car I don't need it either . 
So I have to learn Black Dog for the ensemble . This should be ... interesting . 
There will never be anyone quite like Nirvana . They have something completely unique that no one will ever get close to . 
I may like Xbox more than playstation , but I love the playstation commercials . 
YES ! New Manchester Orchestra ! I can't wait :) 
< PROPMALE > wants me to train at the hardcore gym with him . This will be fun and horrible at the same time .

Steal the life left inside of meeeeeeeeeeeeee 
If anyone ever hurt her I would hunt them down , cut of their < PROPMALE > , stab out their eyes , and slice their throat with a giant bowie knife . And that's just the lethal stuff I would do after the non-lethal crap .
