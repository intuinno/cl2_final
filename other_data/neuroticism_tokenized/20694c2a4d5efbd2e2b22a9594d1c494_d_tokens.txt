HAPPY TURKEY DAY 

Do they have a Farkle rehab somewhere because I have a problem . I think that is the first step in recovery . 
Playing farkle while listening to the world ending as the wind blows and the rain falls 
OMG . A body should not have to feel this worn out . And people wonder why I don't get into the holiday season . 
And why did I get a puppy ? She is going to spend more time in her kennel than outside of it if she keeps chewing stuff arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh . 
It's December 9th at 10:20 pm and 69 degrees outside . How great is that . I love the south . 
I think I have a ghost that likes to break things and see me spend money . First my microwave now my Direct TV DVR . The DVR is only 6 months old . GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 
I have to say I can cook a mean Christmas dinner . Wish y'all could have been here . But I have some very happy dogs here right now . 
I finally found a wrinkle remedy . CLOSE YOUR EYES !!!!!! 
Somebody needs to talk me out of getting another cattle dog . 
If you pay attention there is at least one stupid question a day being asked . Even if you are doing the asking . 
I love North < PROPFEMALE > . It is January 17th and I have all of the windows open .

IT'S SNOWING !!!!!!!!!!!! WOO HOO 
I HATE SATURDAYS 
Ok I am sitting here at my computer with a dog that I am baby sitting growling at me for no reason . This is going to be a long week for him . 
I sold the car . WOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOO . Ok now I'm going to cry . 
Spring has sprung !!!!!!!! WOOOO HOOOO 
Making hawian bread in my bread machine . I love this thing . 
Two days off and Mama has been shopping . Bought a new stove and it is going to be delivered on Monday . WOOO HOOO Have to stain the used futon frame I got . All of the dogs are happily chewing on rawhides , except the chihuahua she is above that . LIFE IS GOOD !!!!!!!! 
OK I really need to get a boyfriend . At least for the heavy stuff . I am getting to damn old to be lifting furniture into the house and down the hallway . But I did it WOOO HOOO . 
I need to get back to work so I can rest and not spend any more money . 
A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week , or that your family is not perfect ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enoug ...... h to have at least one true friend ! 
Ok someone hacked into my facebook account . If anyone gets an email from me via facebook do not open the link . IT IS A TROJAN !!! Only open if I put ** in the subject with the subject . 
I have air conditioning in my old truck . WOOOHOOO It didn't cost me a thing to get fixed . Now I am going to hold out on buying a car until maybe next year . 
Next year I am going to hire someone to take care of all of these leaves in my back yard . 
We have children going to bed without food ..... Elderly going without needed medicines ..... Mentally ill without treatment ..... Troops without proper equipment ..... Yet we donate millions to other countries before helping our own first ...... 99% of ppl won't copy and repost this !!!!!! WILL YOU ?.... I DID !! 
What a lazy day . Starz and Encore had a free movie weekend and since it was raining most of the day and all of the housework was done I just laid around all day . To bring back memories , does anyone know the movie Dazed and Confused ? Does it bring back any old memories for all of you that have seen the movie . 
Let's see who is paying attention .... Everysingle\ 
one of you ? are on my Friend list as a result of a consciousdecision . \ 
I am not only glad to count you as friends but also asfamily !... \ 
Let's see who in my Friends list actually paysattention .... Copy and \ 
paste this in your status . ( I will be watching tosee who re-posts ) \ 
Thank you for caring ?? 
It is finally raining . We needed the rain . Rainex windshield wash is great in heavy downpoors . But driveways don't do so well . Need to get the shovel and rake out tomorrow . 
Why is it that if I was in a room full of a thousand people that the only crazy person in the room would seek me out . I am a crazy person magnet . 
I want to thank < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > for a great day . THANKS GUYS . YOUR AMAZING . 
Got hooked on a marathon of Whale Wars . 
is pet sitting a pit/lab mix that is the biggest baby in the world but has no idea how big she is . She is a < PROPFEMALE > cat terrorist . This is going to be a long two weeks for the cats . 
Nothing funnier than a FAT cattledog playing with a rubber pig toy that grunts like a pig . Kind of ironic huh ? 
How does an animal get over surgery so fast ? My cat got neutered today and he acts like nothing happened . It simply mystifies me . 
I have 8 dogs at my house right now . Pet sitting is great . Going to cook a turkey for me and my furry friends tomorrow . HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE . 
Why is it that the last bolt makes a 10 minute job into 2 hours ? 
I need a day off from my day off . 
This 24 hour bug does not know how to tell time . 
Ok you know it is cold when I buy a hat . I DON'T WEAR HATS . 
Snow in Wilmington is not right . If this keeps up I am moving more south . 
OK the weather people really goofed . They said under and inch of snow for my area . They need to come to my yard and see there is 6 inches of snow here and it is still snowing .
