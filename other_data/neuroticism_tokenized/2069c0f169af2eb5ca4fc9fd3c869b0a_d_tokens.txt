Fuck , I guess it's back to working that full-time shift again ... gotta find a job ! <---- since when I was a fucken weakling ..... I'll try on January 4th ..... take me in !!! I need school !!! 
Hmmm .... I wonder what will become of this situation . Think , think , think ... 
How big can I dream until it begins to break down ? Do they happen by coincidence ? or is hard work the best way to getting yourself out there ? 
I thought one thing then my mind shifts to another . 
Fuck it , keep on gunnin ' . 
It's almost Christmas day ! Hey , hey , we can't forget that it is Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ! Woo ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody ! Started the day with a swim , came home to spend time with the blood-bonds , and now off to spend a time with good people . 
Damn , It's been a while since I worked my body so much . I'm tired . 
It's nice to take a good shit . Hahahahaha ! 
Boom ! Cack-a-lack-cack-cack-cak-cak .... blrat-cak-cak-cak ! Boom ! Pop , Pop !.... Yeeheee . 
Never did anything for two days ! I am going nuts staying in this place ! One more day of this illness and it's all done ! 
It's almost the new year . One day , two hours , and about a little over a half hour of 2009 left to spend . I'm thinking of what to do on the last day ... 
This year is going to be an interesting year ; I can feel it . 
I need a new picture ! 
I need to run and expand the lungs . Expansion ! 
My body feels run-down ... SLEEP !!! 
Listen here , listen here . 
I feel like I need to leave ... hmmm .... 
Bia Bia ! Why you actin ' like a like a ! Bia Bia ! Why you fussin ' like a like a ! Bia Bia ! Why you lookin ' like a like a ! Bia Bia ! Why you frontin ' like a like a ! 
Breaking that chain one link at a time . 
F-----' Fish !!! 
I'm thinking that if I had three heads then I can read my text for philosophy , study some Tagalog , and satisfy my need for procrastination all at the same time . 
I'll take a little nap before I go . 
Alright . Let's do that again . Good morning ! 
Heading out . Hear from you people later .

Alright . Ready , set ..... man I'm hungry . 
Now wouldn't that be nice ? 
I'm out . Maybe I'll catch something . 
I don't know what it is . Maybe I'm mad , maybe I'm sad , maybe , I'm happy , maybe I'm scared . I don't know what it is . It's just one of those days . 
I guess so , huh . 
That's just the way it is . Ah yeah . 
Hmmm .... BAM ! 
hmm ... it's like saying \whatever already\ " .... you know ? " 
You idiot . Go strip bar already . 
I'll just put LIFE on hold for a little bit . I don't feel like speaking to it yet . 
But then again this shit has gone on for way too long already ... something must be done . 
I'll just see you guys around . Peace . 
Hahahaha . I get it now . Finally . I just don't give a shit anymore . Yup . d (^-^) b 
Wow . I don't even feel 21 ... well in actuality I don't turn 21 until 8:38 a.m. Hahahaha ! 
Boo . I have class tomorrow . q (-_-) p . Boo . I need to study for a quiz . Boo . 
Geez , it's cold . It's time to make myself a blanket-cocoon . 
I'm just thinking .... world , why'd it turn so cold all of a sudden ? 
I'm off to catch myself some aquatic species with a spinning device , a stick with rings , a good length of plastic string , and a sharp , bent piece of metal . hahahaha . 
Hahahaha . Today is such a nice day ; it was pretty eventful too . Hahahaha . I wonder where I can buy a splint ? 
The ankle has gotten better , but my foot is still swollen . I never thought I'd see myself with bloated toes . Looks like their stuck together . Yeah ! d('-')b 
I need to head out to the water . The southside waves are calling me . 
Things are definitely going to get interesting . Yup . Well , it could turn out good or bad , but I just hope I get more interesting things afterwards . 
Hmmm .... no matter the situation , life does go on . Hahaha . Now that forces me to appreciate every moment not like it's my last but in a way that I'll never appreciate it like before . 
Wooo !!! That damn sink isn't leaking anymore . Woo ! It took almost four hours to fix it , but damn , I feel like I just became more of a handyman . 
hoo I'm going to head out soon . Don't know what to do though . 
Gondangit ! You know what I just found out ?! I can't fucken run yet !!! 
Okay . I think a bone in my ankle may be a little out of place ; I can feel the jam if I try to run . Man , this sucks donkey toes . 
Tao do nothing but there is nothing that Tao does not do ........ heh ??? Hahahaha !!! 
Hoy ! I'm out .

Boom Shakalaka . It's happiness looked at from the side . Woo ! 
Whoa ! It's like my mind is open . It's not everywhere ; it's just open . It's like it's open and just sitting there . Waiting ... for what ? I don't know .... I don't get it either . 
Damn . I feel like I'm a buzzin ' . I'm so freakin ' wired ; it's funny . Hahahahaha . 
Okay . I'm slowing down now . Good morning people . 
Oh shit ! I fell asleep for about two hours and now my mind thinks it's up for anything but the body isn't agreeing . I can't go back to sleep . I need to drain this mind-blowing energy ! 
I'm thinking that I want to go fishing .

I'll see that counselor tomorrow right after work . But damn , I missed that class I wanted to go to for some review . Other than that , what's a happenin tomorrow ??? 
I'll live for tomorrow , and I'll live for today . I'll live with the consequences ; that's why I'm here to stay . I won't bother you about how you live the life you're in ; I'll die when I die , so let me live my life until then . 
Smashed my big toe earlier this morning with a pallet < PROPFIRST > loaded with a pallet of bottled water . Thought the flesh was torn off but it was just the skin . Hahahaha what a great turn of events . It hurts , but I'm good d('-')b 
Finally , finals week has come to show its ugly face . 
I want to have a sparring match ... anyone ??? 
Okay , I may have to go to a doctor tomorrow to check my toe . I don't think it's healing properly .... awww shit .... I hope i don't have any problems . 
Wow . For a pill that doesn't have drowsiness as a side-effect , I'm as sure as shit that it is making me drowsy . 
For some damn reason , this wound is taking so much energy out of me . I feel like I'm getting weaker ... Rawr !!! Not yet !!! Not now !!! 
I've been thinking a lot lately , and I think it's time for me to re-think things over once again . 
< PROPFEMALE > Apple Juice ! 
There is a fine line between thinking something is right and knowing something is right . I kick myself in the ass for not seeing this until today . 
If\ 
you're in a bad situation , don't worry it'll change . If you're in a\ 
good situation , don't worry it'll change . <--- John A . < PROPFEMALE > Sr. 
The end of today will < PROPFIRST > the end of the person I have become . The start of tomorrow will < PROPFIRST > the beginning of the person I will become . That's how it is ; it's plain and simple . 
Society's reality needs to shove it up the ass . My own reality needs a kick to the ass . Do I need that pain ?... Who doesn't ? 
I realized yesterday while looking at the ceiling that I've forgotten something . I've been trying all night to get a feel for it , and it hasn't popped up yet . 
If so , I also must take a dive like him . Leave everything behind if I have to . Everything . Then I can say that too . Fuck it all , yes ? 
That is why I say I've been living this life that I have trouble accepting myself though I\ 
regret no second of living this life ; the only things I do\ 
regret are all the people I threw aside to keep on living this life , I say , that has been unsatisfactory . 
My true , learning , immovable self has been waiting to break free from these chains . After all these years of not being freed , he still struggles . That is why I know I've been missing something . This feeling of emptiness all the damn time . It ends now . 
Life is fairly simple , but keep in mind that the simple things are actually the hardest things to maintain daily . 
Went fishing with a couple of the boys from work . Feels refreshing . Need to chill with these guys a lot more . 
Hiking tomorrow anyone ? Thinking Makapu'u lighthouse or < PROPFEMALE > head . Don't know yet . 
Tonight , I'm giving in my two-weeks notice to < PROPMALE > Quijote , so I can go and play with bread at HFA . hahahahaha . 
I'm on going-to-sleep status then it's sleep status ! Woo ! Later on going on a little hiking adventure . Woo ! 
I never really know what to write in this thing . 
Orientation today . \\('o')/ Keeping it rolling . Woo ! 
Time to sleep . Heading out to Marisco later with a couple of the boys from work . Hope I catch something ... nah I don't really care actually I just want to chill outdoors with a nice , cool beer and get all chatty . yeah . 
hahahahaha . What fun . Supposed to have gone overnight fishing , but I end up getting drunk and sleeping halfway through . Okay , next time I'll hold off on the beer a little . Gone dang hangover after sleeping on the rocks .... hooo . 
Six more days then it's back to the old sleepin ' habits . Sun up = Up and about . Sun down = partially awake/snoring my ass off . repeat . d('-')b 
Good night facebook ... cuz it would just sound off if I say good afternoon before I sleep . 
Five more days . Then I can start working all day . 
Chug it down cuz the stress is crappy then once it's gone , great fucken balls of fire , you'll sure be damn happy . 
Change it up then go all out 
Fourth of July fireworks display at Ala moana beach park was bomb ! There's a certain one that flitters down while it branches out that was the most exciting to see . It's like a veil that drops and shapes into a tree . Very beautiful . Two-thumbs up d('-')b 
I've never felt so relaxed in a while ; The rain keeps me in a calm state . It's like for every drop that breaks and echos through my ears , the negative thoughts and feelings about anything and everything breaks with them . Maybe that's why I've been longing for the rain all this time . 
Next week thursday ! Who's up for a potluck ? 
I got a cola-strawberry icee mix at the aloha gas station , and I expected it to taste like a cola strawberry icee .... that sucker tasted like a strawberry pastry !!! Maybe it was the fumes in there ... I don't know ... 
I'm hungry for a plate lunch . 
Anyone want to chill ? Get at me through my phone . 
Digging to go fishing with my friend . Keehi boat ramp bound . Get at me through the little machine you put to your ear if you like come try snag fishy mouths with sharp bent pieces of metal . Alright ! d('o')b 
Bam ! Done work ! Haw , I miss having adventures on Fridays , but I work 8 in the morning tomorrow ... oh well ... I'm gettin money , I'm I'm gettin ' money . 
I'm thinking Chinese takeout for dinner . 
It's about time to lie down and look up . 
Work in progress ... 
Damn . Just clocked out and ended my shift about a half hour ago . Never wanted to be there for three extra hours , but my paycheck is going to look pretty damn good next week . I got to say though that my kimchee chicken fried rice and a raspberry mist is bomb after a hard days work . Good job people ! Good job ! 
Hell of a night ! Haha ! In other news , last day of my work weekend and once again off tomorrow . Too bad my battery died while installing a deck in my car so it's out of service for now which means no fishing tonight .... DAMN ! Get at me through my phone if anythings up . Halrite ! 
It was fun . I'm out . 
Today went by beautifully =) 
It's peaking on the south side . Can , no can ? 
Chilled with some of the guys after work . I gotta call it a night though ; there's an early alarm waiting to bust my ears at five in the morning . Sorry dudes , I just lost track of time . Next time , next time we go chill . I'm out . 
Last night of the summer , got sent home earlier than expected from work due to sickness . I was supposed to party it out for my friends 21st today , but it ain't happening . WTF !!! F##### U VIRUS ! F#### #U ! 
First day was alright I guess . I already know the one problem with my classes : the state of boredom that overcomes everything else . Awww ! 
You know what ? I just found out my safety expired yesterday ... guess who's waking up early to get it . 
I'm just so damn exhausted ! Ziegler , I better get a good grade on that midterm ! 
It's like I said money talks , but when the fuck does it start to make sense . 
Pert Plus makes my scalp feel minty ... it's a weird ass feeling .... minty ... 
HOOOO !!!! FINALLY !!!! I'M FREE !!!! I'M FREE !!! UNTIL NEXT MONTH .... damn .... BUT FOR NOW I'M FREE !!! I'M OUT !!!! 
I can't think of much to say ... all the good times we all had with you ... just wish could have had more .... R.I.P. Uncle Boy ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
I'm getting sick and tired of being sick and tired .... If I get sick off of being sick does that make me double-sick ?... double-sick ?... two-sick ? TOO SICK ? I'M TOO SICK ! SO THAT MEANS I'M TOO TIRED ! I MADE A CORNY-SHIT JOKE !!! HAHAHAHAHA !!! 
It gets me every single time the thought pops in my head . It is inevitable . It is real . I just can't believe that we are nothing more than human . That feeling of being so high with bliss then dropping straight down to rock bottom in to the reality of it all . Ha ! I guess it is what it is . It is going to happen . I just know that I shouldn't get too deep in to that end of the pool . 
Resolution : [ ] Enjoy 
[ x ] 
Gotta go 
Thank you all for the B-day wishes ! Made my day that much better ! Thanks again !
