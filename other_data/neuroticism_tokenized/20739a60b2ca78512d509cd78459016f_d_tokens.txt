With my freeze < PROPFIRST > I'll stop -- the pain . It's not a death < PROPFIRST > or an ice beam--that's all < PROPFIRST > Snow . I just think you need time to know that I'm the guy to make it real , the feelings you don't dare to feel . 
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job but I get no offers , just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue . I do declare there were times that I was so lonesome I took some comfort there . Lie la lie . 
Last night was the worst close EVER . We didn't get out til 2 am . Now I get to go back for an eight hour shift at 11:30 . Lucky me . I'm tiiirreed :(

There's a bad < PROPFEMALE > on the rise . 
I taught Jynx to take my socks off when I say \socks please ! \ " ^_^ She's so cute .. " 
isn't ready for school tomorrow ... 
Today hasn't been so bad , but I'm nervous for HS 390 ! 
I can't seem to pry myself away from webcomics to do my homework ... this is a bad sign . 
French in twenty minutes ... Nervousness ensues . 
Well , two days in and I'm officially nervous about the semester already . Way to go , self . Way to go .

September 11 , 2001 . Never Forget . 
Back to the daily grind . 
Watching Saved by the < PROPFEMALE > ... yeah .... I <3 Screech . 
It was never clear what would come next but that's the risk and that's the test/ And you were the only one so far to follow/ And no one talks about when one might stop and need to rest /Or how long you sit alone before you stop looking back /It's like you're waiting for Godot / And then you pick your sorry ass up off the street and Go ... 
I wish I had saved up all those nap-times that I didn't want to take from my childhood so I could take them now . 
is surprised and somewhat alarmed that < PROPFEMALE > banned hijabs .

Time to write a < PROPFIRST > paper . 
I don't know why I'm so tired ! This book keeps making me pass out which is not very conducive to paper writing . 
New pants , then Undergrad Journal meeting , then Writing Center meeting , then the Sigma Tau < PROPFEMALE > induction ceremony and THEN paper writing ! 
Even though we ain't got money , I'm so in love with you , < PROPFEMALE > . Everything will bring a chain of love . In the morning , when I rise , you bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me everything will be alright . 
Dog at my feet , thunderstorm outside , coffee in my hand , news on the TV --- I wish I didn't have to leave . 
Here comes the sun and I say , it's alright .

No motivation + a paper + French homework = procrastination and a grumpy tomorrow 
Wow , this outline sucks ... Oh , well . That's what happens when interlibrary < PROPFEMALE > books don't get here on time . 
Holy cow . I'm in the archives researching < PROPFIRST > Voelker ( author of Anatomy of a Murder ) and his handwriting is HARD TO READ .

Anyone know about any dog trainers in Marquette ? 
I've been working too , every night and day . We gotta get out of this place if it's the last thing we ever do . 
I wish sometimes that I lived closer to civilization . Jynx and I would have so many things to do ! ALL of the stock trainers in Michigan are by my hometown !

\The words just came when I opened my mouth They said \"' Whoooa ! Bath of bacon!'\ " - The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy " 
Go away snow . 
Beat Fable II today instead of doing my homework ! I'm going to be regretting that .... 
Dear Sir or Madam , will you read my book ? It took me years to write , will you take a look ? It's based on a novel by a man named Lear , and I need a job , so I want to be a paperback writer . 
Researching universities in England ... lalalalala . 
Quitting .

It really tied the room together . 
If I die before I wake , feed < PROPMALE > . He's been a good dog , my best friend , right through it all . 
Just wants to snuggle with my doggy and not write this < PROPFIRST > paper . 
Hmm ... well , I'm registered for classes . < PROPFEMALE > Freed , I signed up for Belly Dancing . If you can't get in I'll give you my spot , but for now we're together ! 
Time to write a 10 < PROPFEMALE > paper in a night ... AGAIN . I really should stop procrastinating . 
I can't remember a time when I felt this much apathy toward a paper ... 
5 pages done out of 10 ... sleep now and wake up at 4 am ? I think so . 
is going to the < PROPMALE > Potter theme park for Christmas . Hell yeah . 
Tomorrow's just your future's yesterday .

So ... Megamind .... pretty great . :) 
I can't decide if I should change my English < PROPMALE > to a Zoology < PROPMALE > ... yikes ... 
I'm so burnt out on paper writing ... :( 
When you keep your laptop on your lap ... ( duh ... ) for a while do your legs start to get sore ? :/ 
It's only almost 1 am and I'm pretty much done with this paper ... Wait , I'm not going to be up at 4 am ? It has to be a lie . 
Paper done , now on to French .

< PROPMALE > Schrute : Welcome to the Hotel Hell . Check-in time in now , check-out time is never . \

Ugh . I'm so mad I forgot that HS390 met last week . >.< 
Time to read the last < PROPMALE > Potter book so I can inform EVERYBODY this weekend that \THAT wasn't in the book ! \"" 
Je ne veux pas y aller à la Table Française ce soir . 
I think I may be getting sick . :\\ 
I can't decide if I want to go to < PROPMALE > Potter tonight or if I should just wait until tomorrow and go for $6 rather than $12 ... 
< PROPMALE > Potter was okay . It's always a terrible idea to read the book directly before the movie -- WHY DID YOU GUYS LET ME DO THAT ?! :P 
wishes Jynx would just chill . >.< 
took Jynx for a long walk and now she's curled up at my feet . Ah , much better . 
Anyone know how to put up a free template into a website ? I'm having issues ... 
Why do people try and come in the NMU Writing Center when the door is locked and the lights are off ? I will never understand it . 
is having a great time with < PROPMALE > and Jynx ! :) I miss everyone from back home , though . 
We are not what you think , we are , we are < PROPFEMALE > .

I might secretly ( not so secretly now ) be starting to like and have true respect for Lady Gaga and her music ... I'm not sure how I feel about this . 
I read the news today , and everything they say just makes me want to stay inside and wait . But a part of me knows that waiting in the throes is on a par with reading with my eyes closed 
Does anyone want to double check my French for my oral ? :\\ 
Ugh . I can't believe how grumpy I am . I want this French oral over with . 
Zut alors ! 
I think , for the first time during an exam week , that I might not get sick . 
< PROPFEMALE > Palin : \I just tweet ; that's the way I roll . \ " \

As much as I'm lothe to admit it , there's something immensely satisfying about being up late penning ( typing ) a paper . Ah , sweet jouissance . 
I'm feelin ' good today . 
You may say I'm a dreamer , but I'm not the only one . ? < PROPFIRST > Lennon , Oct 9 1940 - Dec 8th 1970 ?

Oh Bevis ! And I thought you were so rugged ! 
Trying to narrow down my research interests for graduate school ... so far I'm at two pages of things I like . Stupid medieval period , being all interesting and stuff . 
Bringing the dog to the apartment with the goal on getting work done ... bad plan . \ 
She won't stop crying . :( 
Paper 1 : 5/10 , due Tuesday . Paper 2 : 0/10 , but I have an idea , due Wednesday . I can do this . 
Dog cut her paw pad really deep today . A vet visit is just another thing to add onto the list of things to do . 
Alrighty , paper 1 FINISHED , paper 2 is at 2/10 due Wednesday and then on to my statement of purpose , French quiz and THEN oral exam ! Then two other exams . And then done . 
Ask ev'ry person if he's heard the story , / And tell it strong and clear if he has not , / That once there was a fleeting wisp of < PROPFEMALE > / Called Camelot . 
Jynx's paw is unofficially costing me $275 . If they just super-glue it shut I'm going to KILL . 
I don't think I've ever been this tired before .
