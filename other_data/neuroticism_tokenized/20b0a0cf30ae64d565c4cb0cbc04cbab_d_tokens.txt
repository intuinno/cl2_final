Won't stop as long as the city sleeps\ 
Don't look back once\ 
Or you might turn around

Stealing my aunts Internet and watching vampire dairies hopefully it's any good p : 
I'm in my happy place owo Lady Gaga all day marathon on fuse 
Well , heaven's not a place that you go when you die . \ 
It's that moment in life when you touch your edge you feel alive . \ 
So live for the moment . \ 
And take this advice , live by every word , \ 
Love's completely real , \ 
So forget anything that you have heard , \ 
And live for the moment now . 
Now , I've walked through hell for you , \ 
What's an adventurer to do\ 
But rest these feet at home with you 
They say at least he's my friend\ 
And he'll treat you kindly in the end\ 
Call me bitter but I'm brimming with hate for both of you\ 
A film is playing in my head of you fornicating in his bed\ 
The satin sheets are < PROPFEMALE > red like your nails that scarred my back 
Desperate and ravenous\ 
I'm so weak and powerless over you 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are shooting stars ? Because I could really use a wish right now .

Home is behind\ 
The world ahead\ 
And there are many paths to tread\ 
Through shadow\ 
To the edge of night\ 
Until the stars are all alight\ 
Mist and shadow\ 
Cloud and shade\ 
All shall fade\ 
All shall fade 
As I drown in lakes of fire , \ 
I will call your name as I expire\ 
It's the last thing that I'll do\ 
I will tell them I'm with you

Strength in my bones put the words in my head . \ 
When they pour out to paper , it's all for you . \

straight up pissed off . 
When I like you , \ 
It's total revenge . \ 
I want to , but I can pretend , \ 
That I don't need to be by your side again . 
I'd rather spend an evening giving birth \ 
then see how your eyes are glued\ 
on everyone but the person you're talking to . \ 
and trapped between babushkas on a plane \ 
is a fraction of how lame\ 
it is to watch you pump the poison \

Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true\ 
Here is the place where I love you . 
Strange things did happen here , No stranger would it be\ 
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree 
Well I was walking down the street just a-having a think\ 
When a snake of a guy gave me an\ 
evil wink . He shook-a me up , he took me by surprise . He had a pickup truck , and the\ 
devil's eyes . He stared at me and I felt a change . \ 
Time meant nothing , never would again . 
That to love is to destroy , and that to be loved is to be the one destroyed . 
So raise your glass if you are wrong , \ 
in all the right ways , \ 
all my underdogs , \ 
we will never be never be anything but loud\ 
and nitty gritty dirty little freaks\ 
won't you come on and come on and raise your glass , 
(???) ...???.... (-`?´- ) 
And I'd slay the horrible beast they commissioned \ 
To steer me away from my mission to your eyes . 
And the song on the radio reminds me and it goes \ 
Sugarpie honeybunch , I don’t want to lose you\ 
I can’t help myself I love you \ 
And nobody else will do 
Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep

for every person who likes this status , i will post one confession about myself . \ 
provide me entertainment Book of the Face 
Confession one : I sing in the shower but only when I'm home alone . And to top it off , it is only one song I sing . ' The Hanging Tree ' from the Hunger Games Trilogy . 
Confession Two : I have two facebook pet peeves . Liking your own status and posting ridiculous statuses about your significant other . I get it , you love them . Now Stfu and stop making facebook your diary . 
Confession Three : I paint my nails to feed a very odd nervous habit of mine . I purposely chip my nails and peel the paint off when I start to feel anxious and what not 
Confession Four : I have a serous obsession of any sort of Horror with in the media . Books , Games , Movies you name it . But I am very easily startled in the outside world , by the most ridiculous situations/items . 
Confession Five : I'm not a romantic person . Never have been never will be . Nine times out of ten I can not tolerate it . The only exception are JR < PROPMALE>'s Novels . 
Confession Six : I abhor it when people wake me up one minute before my alarm goes off . Wake me up thirty minutes before hand , I'm probably just moan and groan and be moderately ticked off . One minute before hand ? I will probably be the irritable wench that hell has ever unleashed 
i have a puppy in my lap . > w < 
Tu Vas Me Détruire 
\Wombats kill things with their butts . \"- < PROPFEMALE > Hauck " 
\Who do you think you are ? You freaky deaky Perv ?! \""
