¤ Mad Exhausted . Wanting A Caramel Macchiato From Starbucks . . 

Shit nothing bout to go to this bomb ass sleepover with my nigga aubrie shit what you mean ?!?!?! 
food ... 
its interesting to me how the things that make you cry are the things that can make you a better person . the feelings of losing all you know can make you look forward to something in the distant future . the people you thought would be in your life forever fade out ; new people find a way to make up for the slack that others take upon themselves to create ; break bonds . promises forgotten . 
the heartache of tomorrow becomes apart of your being so well that not even you can shake it . so you sit there everyday making up excuses for the you questions you already know answers to and try to find a way to explain whats already explained .. 
Happy Easter everyone !! Have a safe and blessed day ! : ) 
Woke up this morning . Came home . Took a shower . Got dressed and realized i have nothing to do today .. 
Up and doing the same thing as yesterday ... nothing ! 
Watching < PROPFIRST > hart . . . mad old mad funny . . . im entertained for now . . . 
Relaxing . 
Eyes wide open free falling from the life i new to the one i want to be apart of completely unstable and ready for what the future holds dont know which path will end positively but i dont care im ready i hope you are too because the futures not waiting .. 
call me a white girl but im watching one of my favorite movies the notebook ; old , sad , but mad interesting .. : ) 
On my way back to louisville from ohio .. wish i could've extended my trip i really dont want to see too many faces tomorrow but i guess i dont have a choice .. 
.. mad tired and although it just started ready for the week to be over .. 
Dang today just put a lot of things in perspective for me . . . things wont be what you expect when someone loves you and you never know it it can put a strain on the relationship you have no matter what the \status\ " is . . . you know who you are and my heart goes out to you .. " 
Wanna be lazy but about to workout 
At home . Watching Bring It On All Or Nothing . Texting one of my besties kash missing you like hell < PROPFEMALE > ! 
.. this ish is simply too much . Are you hearing yourself right now . Its not gonna work all this trial and error mess is beginning to become too much so much time i can never get back and for what ? What did i get ? Nothing . Broken promises and negative persuasions .. never moving . Just wanna stay clouded .. but i know it'll never get better .. thanks . 
At some time in your life you have to grow up and realize the friends you have wont be around forever .. 
On my way home from the mall looking for a prom dress no luck so far .. 
At my sisters house about to leave so i can go home and do my psych analysis papers on silence of the lambs and work on my other essay for psychology .. hopefully they turn out good .. 
Had a full schedule today went to oxmoor got my prom dress although it took me two hours in one store to get got some shoes bought my heels and clutch got my dress altered got food and did m day shopping ... exhausted ! 
After school doing this play mad tired and want to eat some dang nacho and cheese ! 
At school watching the drama clubs play < PROPFEMALE>'s dream ... 
Got my dress today ! Excited and anxious for prom ready for it to be here . Only three days left its gonna go by mad slow . -_- 
Proms tomorrow but it feels like its going to be another saturday .. hopefully by tomorrow i'll be in the \prom\ " state of mind .. " 
Typing a paper and watching Speak ; voice almost gone ; trying not to talk .. 
.. ready and open to whatever comes my way .. 
Been up for a while . Trying to figure out whats next .. 
Studying for < PROPMALE>' psych final tomorrow . keep your fingers crossed for me . i know i'll need it . ^_^ 
Tired ! Extremely tired ! But this psych book is stuck to me like industrial glue . I havent studied this hard in a long time . Hopefully it'll pay off . We'll see tomorrow =_= 
Watching the best man trying to stay awake .. 
Up and aint doing nothing just sitting here .. 
Damn another day .. too much of nothing went to the waterfront now we're back at < PROPFEMALE>'s about to watch some movies ... knowing me im bout to be out in ten trying to find something to get into ... -__- 
Im tired . Mad tired . Its not a waste of time because the effort felt worth it . Is it still the same ? Im sick of the illusions ; all the smoke and mirrors bs im getting isnt helping me at all . Is it worth the problems ? Why do you find pleasure in me feeling discouraged ? 
Just got home not too long ago had funn all day watching bad boys about to go to sleep in a few ... 
FINALLY !! \ 
Put internet on the laptop now i can get stuff done ... 
People just know what to do and say to ruin my day .. 
having the longest conversation with davonte 
Well damn thanks for letting me know not even going to say it dont matter cause id be bullshitting if i was to ; its unfortunate but im not living in a fantasy not everything is meant to last .. 
I'm going to be changing not so people look my way . For the benefits of myself . DRAMA and PETTY BS is no longer a way for people to see me . I've thought about it endlessly ; life wouldn't be catastrophic without it . NO LONGER will I pass up good things . THANK YOU for the ones who love holding others back . If we didn't go through what I went through we wouldn't have known that better things were coming our way .. 
Ugh ! Packing for Ohio ... <3 
just got up not too long ago\ 
* adrianne*\ 
now its a habit with my friends lol\ 
washed my hair bout to find something to do\ 
BORED .. 
I am not commanding you , but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the earnestness of others . 
Missing home .... but at the same time enjoying my time while Im gone . 
Bored out of my mind ! 
just got in the house ... \ 
went to a salon .. \ 
why is it so painful to be a young lady ?? lol 
:D 
Mmkay i see .. \ 
Hmm .. any pointers ? 
shopping .. \ 
AGAIN .. 
doing laundry\ 
listening and singing to torn by letoya luckett\

( o_0 ) MOVIE NIGHT ! 
ugh ! another day . glad its over . . . 
today went from terrible to good .. \ 
had a hallmark moment with my god mom\ 
thankful she's in my life to guide me because\ 
lord knows i need it especially now more than ever .. 
the only thing left to do now is wait .. \ 
with my heart , eyes , and mind open\ 
and clear of anything that will cloud\ 
my judgement ... this is no longer\ 
seen as a game it's getting too damn real\ 
{ snik}\ 
the end is closer now than ever yes\ 
but when one door closes another one\ 
opens and if you happen to only have\ 
one door there's always the window ... 
dum < PROPFEMALE > est , spes est !! 
its funny when you look at your little cousins and think back to when you were their age and how much trouble you used to get into .. all you can think about is\ 
\damn my moms { or pops } would have kicked my ass if i did ... \ " \ 
just got done with some SAT practice\ 
testing for the day and looked at my\ 
schedule for this year it dont even seem real .. \ 
last year of high school ... 
been looking up stuff all day trying to be\ 
mad organized by the time i get home .. \ 
... drained ... 
at the beginning it was all fun and games\ 
but now we're another year older and\ 
another year wiser ... in a sense ... so\ 
now we have to choose what we really\ 
want out of this ... fun or commitment to\ 
the future and whatever it holds ... 
Never realized .. 
Why does looking at colleges have to be < PROPFEMALE > damn stressful ? \ 
I mean first you look them up and choose one then you have\ 
to deal with the SAT\\ACT scores , application dates , \ 
requirements , financial aid forms ; the certain financial aid\ 
UGH its never ending for those who are still in\ 
high school after this year ya'll better not complain about anything\ 
once you look at colleges the cost will hurt you\ 
feelings .. 
hmm .. 
The only exercise some people get is jumping to conclusions , running down their friends , side-stepping responsibility , and pushing their luck ! \

Now I'm done .. 
Slowly trying to find ways to stay busy and pick up the pieces of something that was broken for so long now . Can't complain because I faithfully tried to avoid the situation . It didn't make it any better instead it just masked it until the day I had to face my fears . 
Trying to broaden my horizons .. \ 
Never know when I can learn something new about myself\ 
and the people I surround myself with ..

Made it to < PROPFEMALE > twenty-four without falling asleep so far . 
I'm so damn bored ! 
You know whats interesting to me ? \ 
When a person is asked what they want in a relationship and they get it\ 
but once they have it they cant find the time to appreciate that person that they're with but instead is focused on the other flaws in the relationship .. amazing ! 
People please ! 
Ugh ! 
Just got in from borders not too long ago . \ 
Last week in Sandusky . 
Love is patient and kind ; love does not envy or boast ; it is not arrogant or rude . It does not insist on its own way ; it is not irritable or resentful ; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing , but rejoices with the truth . Love bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . Love never ends . \

They say you can't have your cake and eat it too .. \ 
But if your good at getting things you want you can\

Back in ky and already . It's been fun night so far . Hopefully tomorrow holds some excitement too . 
High 0ff Happiness !! 
Mad Tired .. 
Most things are meant to change .. 
Man today was enough to drive me to do things that i would forever regret but since all that is too much to deal with im just going to have to prioritize the people in my life ; one by one ; setting boundaries and maybe even removing the stressful things to help myself grow into the better person i know im capable of being .. today was enough to make me think long and hard about myself and those around me .. 
I have good intentions even when it doesnt look like it . My motives might seem as if Im only out for me but believe me you have nothing I could possibly want . Im not gonna bs you and thats just how it is and I expect the same from you . Lifes too short not to keep things straight forward ; too short to be caught up on the past ; if you want things to happen you have to get out there and make them happen for yourself . 
Bored out of my effin mind right now . Nothing to do . It's hot as Satans womb right now and there is no relief no matter where i go !! On top of that i have a badass headache .. 
I definately need some excitement in my life ! New people in my life ! New surroundings in my life ! I'm content with the usual things and people in my life but , meeting new people cant do anything but help improve it right ? So thats what I'm looking for . . . 
Its so simple if you hate it that much then stay single ;\ 
if you want a relationship hell let this be known . \ 
No one is a mind reader they're not going to know what\

Doing this Pre Cal homework . Not as hard as I thought it would be especially since i have an easy first trimester . I don't have a reason to complain about anything for the next six weeks .. 
You never appreciate the little things until they're gone . \ 
By that time its almost impossible to get them back . 
In the house eating these oreo's and doritos ; drinking a coke ; watching made ; trying to stay focused on the task at hand { pre-calculus } but damn its mad boring .. 
The saddest love is to love someone , to know that they still want you , but the circumstances don't let you have them . \

is looking for something to do .. 
When I get there , you'll be the first to know .. 
Is this going to be different ? \ 
Or am I always going to be looking\ 
to someone who was never really\ 
there ? 
Lonely ? 
What the { bleep } does that even { bleeping } mean you make no { bleeping } sense at all sometimes im greatful that we are where we { bleeping } are !! But there's something that makes me still , even to this day { bleeping } love everything about you what the { ..... bleep } { ??? } { o_o } 
- Who can take care of you better than your family ? \ 
-- No matter who you are , if you've been there from the beginning and is still a strong part of my life , if I've ever told you that I loved you your my family .. <3 
tired . its was a easy day today had the clinics today they caught on easy which makes our job this year easy too thanks to those who showed up but im about to get something to eat and look at these colleges .. 
So many things I want to do . \ 
So many new things waiting to be discovered by me . \ 
So many things I want to see . \ 
Where do I start ? 
Many won't agree with what I'm going to be doing this year .. \ 
Ask me if I care ?

I think its funny when I think I find someone interesting then they open their mouths and all I can think is : Ugh ! Shut up !! 
Is there a difference in lying and omitting the truth ? 
Smdh . Uhm well this was a good day ;; l0l :) 
When you like someone and\ 
never tell them it's all on you . \ 
So when you see them with\ 
someone else don't get mad . 
Hmm , if you don't like it speak up and correct me when I'm wrong .. 
Just because it's unexpected doesnt mean it's not what I'm looking for .. 
Really wanting a slice of a cookie cake , a pint of vanilla bean ice cream , some oreos and a slice of strawberry cheesecake with whipped cream from the can not the container ... 
Content With Where I Am Right Now .. 
Waiting for something good to happen .. hmm .. 
Watching When A Stranger Calls ... mad bored ! 
Up doing this pre calculus homework ... 
I need a vacation niggs just know how to get on my nerves .. 
About to worry about myself for a while some events just over this week have been having me second guess those in my life . I don't know where I want to be just yet , but I'm not liking where I'm at . Changes are needed and although they might not be liked I have to consider what's best for me in order to be happy .. 
The worst thing about wanting something is just that . \ 
The wanting and in reality just because you want it it\ 
doesn't necessarily mean your going to get it . \ 
No matter how bad you want it ... 
The best thing about being stuck in the house is that\ 
you can piss everyone who's making you stay home off :) 
Going to spend all day trying to find ways to escape !! l0l 
Up and out hoe !! l0l ^_^ 
There's only so much of myself I'll put out there until I feel like your no longer worth the time and energy . It's funny because you only noticed when I stopped trying but when I did try you never hesitated to take me for granted .. 
Nothing but happiness and bliss ... 
Don't worry babe when I figure it all out you'll be the first to know . . . 
Bored looking at this pre-calculus work that I KNOW needs to be done all the while listening to < PROPFEMALE > sullivan - holding you down .. Thoughts are heavy on my mind of what I want to hear but I have yet to hear the truth .. About to focus on this school stuff mad tough because all thats left to do now is kick back and relax .. its all up in the air now so there's nothing I can do ... right ? 
Not wanting to be particularly loquacious or ostentatious .. 
Dear { submit name here } , \ 
I've waited and waited and yet that's all i seem to be doing . Don't get me wrong we've had some good times and I'm still trying to figure out what you could possibly want from me . You see { submit name here } I can't say this without feeling discouraged nothing in this has to be seen negatively . So take this and run with it . I Love You . I can't help myself when your near me I have to have you ! 
It's getting too hard too stressful . It's getting too real . 
I love when people who don't have any problems at all or never had to deal with stressful things that are beyond their years try and tell me how to handle my life and how to deal with my problems . If you know me and know my personality then you should already know that if I'm not asking you don't take it upon yourself to ' try ' and tell what I should and should not be doing ... thank you oh so very much : ) 
If you really have to think about it then it's not real .. 
Getting ready to go to the < PROPFEMALE > G . Komen walk for the cure for breast cancer ! Excited . Everyone should come out and support the walkers and runners or join it's all for the good of others .. :) 
In the end it is what it is . \ 
If not spoken on it will be seen as nothing more but regret . \ 
The biggest fear is words that are not spoken .. \ 
My biggest regret is leaving them that way .. 
Ugh . I hate when boys try to call themselves men . Your simply a scared individual .. nothing more nothing less , and that's fine .. 
Maybe its true once you stop looking you'll end up right where your supposed to be .. 
In the end , you can't control what other people do or believe .. 
Didn't get a < PROPMALE > to pay the cellular device < PROPMALE > yesterday so the phone is off .. Ugh ! I can not live without my phone ! :( 
I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new . What is broken is broken -- and I'd rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived . \
