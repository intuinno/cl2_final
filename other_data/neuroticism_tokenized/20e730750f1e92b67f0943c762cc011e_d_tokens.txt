But he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail- Watching < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > (:

When < PROPFIRST > Einstein died , his final words died with him . The nurse at his side didn't understand < PROPMALE > . 
This has been the longest week ever . 
Stumbling . Thank you , < PROPMALE > . :) 
Here's a fun fact : On 15 April 1912 the SS Titanic sunk on her maiden voyage and over 1,500 people died . Fourteen years earlier a novel was published by < PROPFIRST > Robertson which seemed to foretell the disaster . The book described a ship the same size as the Titanic which crashes into an iceberg on its maiden voyage on a < PROPFEMALE > April night . The name of Robertson's fictional ship was the Titan . 
I can do the best futterwacken in the land .

Man is capable of much atrocity as he has imagination . 
Off to work ! :D 
Work was great . I feel accomplished actually having all my homework done at a descent time . I'm not sure what to do now . 
So < PROPFEMALE > and I were meddling around in wallamart , looking at nair and whatnot . I saw this bottle that said moisturizer and it looked cool , so I put some on . Turns out it was more hair removal crap . My hands stink :( I can't get the smell off . lol 
really wants a pickle . 
This really doesn't feel like a Friday . Maybe it's because I actually have to do something tomorrow . Like work . -_- 
Maybe I should treat Sonic like Spongebob treats the Krusty Krab . 
Por Ti Volare <3

Who in the hell burns their < PROPFEMALE > ?? Oh wait , that'd be me . Lol what an evening . 
So the ice cream at work exploded on me today . Mmm ! 
How is Dio just gonna go die like that 
I should probably discipline myself when it comes to this whole sleeping thing . 
I really cannot stand the usage of \epic fail . \ " Go get a life please . " 
Maybe it's just me , but I really just don't find it necessary to go 45 in a 70 . But that only happens when I actually have to be somewhere -_- 
Finally ! Headed to Nac :)

Communication . It's the first thing we really learn in life . Funny thing is , once we grow up , learn our words and really start talking , the harder it becomes to know what to say . Or how to ask for what we really need . 
The Real L Word ??? Wth is this ? I don't think I'm looking forward to it . 
I'm so sick of ignorant people . Please just keep your distance . 
Am I the only one that doesn't get notified when I get picture comments ? :/

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans 
Well . The sunrise was pretty this morning 
Finally . Time to pass the hell out :P 
Ignorance is bliss ? Debatable . 
Okay , so can I just have you for forever please ? :)

Rainbows are my favorite kind of magic . They put joy in my nose and love in my feet :D 
I've always lived like this . Keeping a comfortable distance , and up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness because no one was ever worth the risk . But you are the only exception 
Speaking of hearts , I need to go to bed . I have no idea what they have to do with each other , I just know that I'm tired . LOL

A beautiful girl can make you dizzy like you've been drinking < PROPFIRST > and Coke all morning . She can make you feel high , full of the single greatest commodity known to man : Promise . Promise of a better day , of a greater hope , of a new tomorrow . This particular < PROPFEMALE > can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl . In her smile and in her soul . In the way she makes every rotten thing in life seem like it's going to be okay 
Let's show the world what love is really like
