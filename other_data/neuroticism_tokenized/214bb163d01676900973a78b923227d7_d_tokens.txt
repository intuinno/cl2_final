Dreams show you everything you need to know about yourself . 
You don't know the force of your words until you scream at the top of your lungs ~ 
Happiness is a source of carelessness ; Anger is a precursor to discipline ; the most efficient teaching is brainwashing ; beginnings and ends are too short to ever enjoy

You can always talk to your parents about your problems . But bear in mind that they will tell you it is 100% your fault and that you have poor judgment . 
Does strictness indicate purpose ? Does looseness mean lack thereof ?

There comes a time when you wonder if sleep will help you get more or less work done . 
Long chats with your parents don't tend to end well . 
I hit the bottom[of my 2 L soda bottle ] 
I've ran about 120x the distance i have driven[behind the wheel ] , but that ratio will shrink in time . Maybe .

There is something very satisfying about exercising until you're tired . \ 
Or maybe I'm just crazy . 
I could save so much time if I ran everywhere , instead of walking . 
Apparently there's a post office in UTC ? How come I've never seen it ?

I feel like I didn't learn anything this year .

My biological clock still thinks it's Monday morning . 
My hands have been glowing red for the past two hours . I hope i don't get any blisters .. 
Went to the library for books , for the first time in oh ... a year ? Things that come to mind :\ 
I like the < PROPMALE > decimal system . It puts all the books I need for my research paper all in one place . \ 
[ When I have time ] I want to look up a subject of interest , find where it is in the library , and read that section of the library , cover-to-cover 
I met a self-proclaimed \hollywood actor\ " on my way home . his forehead was bleeding and he was \ " stranded\ " under the UTC bridge 
My annotated bibliography for my Research paper is the same length as all my other essays this year . ( 5 pages ) 
???????????????????????????? 
Sometimes I wish I had more freedom . But as time goes on , I learn more and more that ' my ' life does not belong to me . It comes with being around people , needy , needy people . But at least I'm not lonely ~ ?
