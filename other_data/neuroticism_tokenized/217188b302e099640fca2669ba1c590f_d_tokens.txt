From yesterday’s class : if kidnapped , make sure u face the kidnapper & share personal info . If masked , take it off . If the kidnapper is not a sociopath ( 99.96% of people in the world ) , u can invoke remorse & increase your < PROPMALE > of not being killed . Turning your back & running away may increase your < PROPMALE > of being killed since they won't have to see your face when they attack ( unless you escape w/out them noticing ) .
