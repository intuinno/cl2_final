Feb . 9 : Bioshock 2 . Mar . 9 : FFXIII . And if God of War III in March turns out to be epic ... I might have to buy a PS3 . 

All the religions of the world , while they may differ in other respects , unitedly proclaim that nothing lives in this world but Truth . - Mohandas Gandhi 
Peaceful sits the wandering mind , The apple red , the wind divine . Forever will the sun go down , Fear not child , do not frown . In time you will come to see , This storm is quietly killing me . 
L M F A O , my ex girlfriend deleted me off her facebook . Oh noes ! I'm so sad ! HAHAHA ! Whatever , beyotch ;D 
I don't think I ordered a water faucet put in next to my bed ... Guess I'm sleeping on the couch again tonight =_= 
I MUNNA EAT < PROPFEMALE > 
Happy Father's Day to all the fathers and soon to be fathers ! And uh , cheers that I'm not one yet ! Lol :) 
is sad to be leaving tomorrow :( 
You shouldn't live so far away >.< 
SO glad to be home . Can't wait until I'm gone again . 
When will you people realize that I'm not cranky from lack of sleep , I'm cranky because you're saying/doing things to make me cranky ! GOD ! Get off my back , people . 
Thankfully , I relaxed last night , and got a good couple hours of sleep last night . Yesterday SUCKED . 
Oh my god ... WHY DID YOU TAKE < PROPFIRST > MAYS AS WELL ?! Couldn't be satisfied with < PROPMALE > , Fawcett and McMahon ? But wait , call now and you'll have eternal peace ;( Goodbye , < PROPFIRST > . 
When the time comes , will I make the right choice ? Have I already torn the veil ? 
Fellate my ego with witty banter . 
Paint me on canvas so I'll become what you could never be . 
Pretty pissed ... apparently my phone screen decided it didn't like working anymore . If you need to get ahold of me , write to me here ... Really annoyed . Damn phone isn't even 6 months old . 
Communicating thoughts of ways , to never have to speak again . 
My car decided it didn't want to work anymore . I hope it's just playing a joke on me . Already towed it =/ 
I hate when skinny girls say they're fat . 
My internal dialogue with myself is slowly becoming external ... I either need more people to talk to , or some medication , haha :P 
My hair looks like an RPG character's hair ... probably developed by Square Enix . Doing my best to not mess it up today xD 
You know , sometimes I feel like I'm just talking to myself . ... Sometimes , I am . 
Picture yourself in a boat on a river , With tangerine trees and marmalade skies . Somebody calls you , you answer quite slowly , A girl with kaleidoscope eyes . 
Turn off your mind , relax and float downstream , it is not dying ... It is not dying ... 
I want you , I want you so baaaad . I want you ! I want you so baaad , it's driving me mad , it's true . 
( 651 ): theres bread in your mailbox im going to eat it ( 651 ): nevermind its newpaper ( God I love TFLN ) 
is a sexy , sexy beast . Word . 
is going , going ... gone . 
It's a spiral ... But it never started very high up , and it keeps going down , and down , and down ... 
Oh god , I miss my < PROPFIRST > so much . I just want to kidnap him and move to another state ! Haha :) 
And when the night is cloudy , there is still a light that shines on me . Shine until tomorrow , let it be . I wake up to the sound of music , mother < PROPFIRST > comes to me , speaking words of wisdom , let it be ... 
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together . See how they run like pigs from a gun , see how they fly ; I'm crying . 
:) :) :) 
Come sail away , come sail away , come sail away with me ! 
Misplaced trust . Dead maiden . Empire lost . Broken sword . 
I ever tell you that < PROPFIRST > is a genius ? My computer is aliiiiiiive !!!! 
When you are slipping into unconsciousness , does it ever creep into your thoughts that perhaps what you said was the wrong thing to say ? That you ruined it all ? Food for thought . 
Be my femen ! 
Rectitude , Courage , Benevolence , Respect , Honesty , Honor , Loyalty . 
\Friends Forever\ " is bullshit . More like \ " Friends until it's no longer convenient . \"" 
Listenin ' to some Zeppelin . Good calm-me-down music . Too much drama going on , it's insane . 
To attract good fortune , spend a new coin on an old friend , share an old pleasure with a new friend , and lift up the heart of a true friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon . -Ancient Chinese Proverb . 
Talking to yourself isn't crazy . No , no ... it's when you respond to yourself that you're crazy . 
Wazaaaaaa ... Off to Ohio for Great-Grandpa's 90th ! 
Home , safe and sound ... tired , but safe . :) 
Beep bop boop ... I am a robot ... 
Bwahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa . 
The problem with evil people is that somehow , they're still procreating and infecting the < PROPFIRST > pool . I call upon four brave souls to liberate the crystals !... er ... 
Whoever answered ' Yes ' to \Would < PROPMALE > ditch a date ? \ " on that stupid Friend Quiz ... I wouldn't >_> You obviously don't know me that well . " 
Hahahahahaha ... does anything even matter anymore ? What's the point of it all ? 
Money makin ' , money money makin ' , super disco disco breakin ' . 
You never know what life will throw at you . Take each breath as if it were your last , laugh as hard as you can , and love with all your heart . There is no dress-rehearsal , this is the premier , folks . 
Banks are fucking bullshit . Let's get one thing clear : LETTING A PAYMENT THROUGH WHEN THERE'S NO FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT IS NOT A COURTESY , BECAUSE YOU THEN CHARGE $35 EVERY TIME . They hold deposits until they feel necessary to deposit them , so you THINK you have the money when it actually isn't in your account yet . FUCK YOU BANKS . We're out $275 in overdraft fees JUST IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS . DON'T DO US ANY COURTESIES ! 
Feeling a bit overwhelmed . 
24 delicious ounces of < PROPFIRST>'s hard cranberry lemonade ... 
' Tis the season for unwanted realizations and revelations . Fml =/ 
Whoa . Phoenix Wright for DS kicks ass . 
I am a master . ... Of what , I have not yet discovered . But I am . 
I just want to get right-proper drunk one of these days . It's been at least 8 months ;_; 
I'm still trying to carve out my little niche ... doesn't seem like I've found it yet . I need a sharper spoon ... Or maybe a shovel . 
I'm so proud of my dad for finishing school ! 
Gon ' be a good day , Tater . 
The darkness stands still . In the silence , I pluck an apple ; the hysterics of calmness . Intensely saturated with emotion , I await the < PROPFEMALE > . 
\Throwing\ " two fingers is not \ " gangsta\ " . It just makes you look retarded . " 
OK , I need opinions ! Should I take ARAB-1000 , which is intro to Arabic Language and Culture , or Intro to Anthropology ? Same credits , but they coincide , I have to pick one , deadline's 10pm Tuesday the 18th ... 
Picked up < PROPFEMALE > , cruised , ate Thai , cruised some more , chilled with Castro and some others and smoked a hookah for hours , cruised some more , dropped < PROPFEMALE > off , drove home . Gonna miss you !! 
Zen of Sudoku ... the game's sucked me in . I'll admit it , I'm addicted . Damn < PROPFIRST > ... 
Am I the only one completely stoked for Dissidia ? ;D 
Fable III ? Honestly ? Here's hoping < PROPFIRST > Molyneux gets it right this time ... 
So , the 80gb PS3 is finally going to drop to $299 ... something more people can actually afford . Bravo , Sony , for finally getting it right . Of course , the Xbox360 Pro was lowered in price to $249 a couple months after I bought it for $349 ... of course ... 
Ohmygodohmygodohmygod two days until Dissidia ... I better have a damn check by then !!!! >=O 
Dissidia ... Checks , gogogogo ! I need you tomorrow ! 
Kinda pissed I have to wait for this ... 
Class tomorrow ... 
So , my Arab class and professor are either going to be totally awesome , and I'm going to love the class , or they'll both be lame , and I won't . We shall see ... 
Pros and cons for today : Pros : Had a decent time in class . Cons : Right now , doesn't look like I can see < PROPFEMALE > ; $145 poorer ; my car wobbles ( AFTER I fixed it ) and I'm afraid to drive it ; I still don't have any money ; My back and knees hurt after standing for 4 hours straight . Fun times . 
AND my phone crapped out on me . Really ? Really ?! What's next ? 
Well , today is starting to look a little better . Got around 10 hours of sleep , and my phone is working again ... who knows for how long . Let's see what today will bring ... hopefully I'll really enjoy my Philosophy of Religion class . 
Yeah , I got Dissidia on Friday ... I've put probably 10-15 hours into it already , and I've still got quite a few things left to do . Good thing I have enough sense to put the game down and finish my homework , haha . Seriously though , best $40 I've ever spent , well worth the wait , exceeds all expectations I had for it :D 
Various objects in motion . Choices to be made . Thoughts to be thought . Places to be . 
Rest in Peace , < PROPFEMALE > . I know we weren't close friends , but I'll miss you all the same . I only wish we had spent more time together ... 
Tantalizing glimpses into possible futures . Don't turn around , the mirror will disappear forever . 
Ah , the bitter taste of defeat . So familiar , yet so repulsive . 
Final Fantasy I-X ... beginning to end . 5 and a half hours into I ... 
Just spent $104 ( that includes Shipping ) on FFIV DS , FFVI Advance , FFVIII , and FFIX , I will then own every game I-IX . ( I still have < PROPFIRST>'s X , haha ) 
I have some freakin ' awesome shirts now . Go go extra financial aid ! Just need to pay for my books now ... lol . 
The Lions played a pretty respectable game . Not bad , not bad at all . 
Of course . Why do I always manage to screw things up ... 
S'all good . Life goes on . 
Graaaaaaah , 7:45 into FFII . This game is annoying me =_= But I'm committed . THOU SHALT NOT BEST ME , VILE DEMON ! * slays * 
Whew . 
Illustrious coating of nonsensical deliberations . 
Woo ! Rock Band 2 !!! 
What the hell is wrong with people ... The world is getting worse every day .

Every day when you're walking down the street , everybody that you meet , has an original point of view . And I say hey HEY ! What a wonderful kinda day , to get to learn to laugh and play , and get along with each other ! 
One never had so much fun ! 
I is tye red . 
Everything is pretty much awesome :) 
Oh lawd , me mum's on faizbewk ... Haha =) 
I think it's pretty funny the first Lions game that's blacked out is the one we win ... Betcha there won't be another blacked out game this season ! \HOLY CRAP THE LIONS WON ! WE HAVE TO GO TO THE GAME NOW !!! \ " Here's hoping for a 13-3 season :) " 
If I had a guitar ... it'd gently weep . 
The sun is up , the sky is blue . It's beautiful , and so are you . 
Dear FFIV DS version : Why d'you hurt so good ? 
So this morning , I loaded up my file , preparing for a boss fight ... and I had already beaten it before I saved last night o.o I'm so awesome I can GAME IN MY SLEEP ! 
GO STATE GO ! 
Shadow Complex was sweet . I recommend any Xbox owners to download it , totally worth the money :) It's Metroid-ish ! 
Sometimes , things don't go your way . Sometimes , they do . The key to living a good life is to accept the former , and enjoy the latter to it's fullest :)

No matter how hot she is , someone , somewhere , is sick of her shit . 
I'm in a pretty good mood :) 
Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme , suggesting rhythm , That will not forsake you , till my tale is told and done . While the firelights aglow , strange shadows from the flames will grow , Till things we've never seen will seem familiar . 
Shwa . 
Too late , my time has come . Sends shivers down my spine , body's aching all the time . Goodbye , everybody . I've got to go ! Gotta leave you all behind , and face the truth ! Mama , ooh ! I don't wanna die ! I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all ! 
Am I the only one that finds < PROPFEMALE > ( from the Progressive commercials ) attractive ? Mmmmm , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ... 
Drinking pear flavored applesauce , eating ramen , wearing pajama pants . Oh yeah . 
If you're lost in the < PROPMALE > of life , you just need to take a step back and re-evaluate things . Simply going north-west-south-west won't get you out ;) 
Tarot does not sound like carrot . 
Fortuitous exchanges of mutual feelings . Life is good . 
No one's gonna take me alive , Time has come to make things right . You and I must fight for our rights , You and I must fight to survive ! 
dislikes that his phone won't send status updates to facebook sometimes . On another note , he refuses to continue to speak in the third person . 
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl , year after year . Running over the same old ground ... What have we found ? The same old fears ... Wish you were here ... 
sure wishes he had a witty comment or intelligent song lyrics to describe what he's feeling . Oh well ... 
< PROPMALE > is amazing , I don't get enough sleep , and I wish I had answers to questions . 
is having a very introspective time of things lately . 
All I can hear I me mine , I me mine , I me mine . Even those tears I me mine , I me mine , I me mine . No-one's frightened of playing it Ev'ryone's saying it , Flowing more freely than wine , All thru ' Your life , I me mine . 
Slefy , with a < PROPMALE > of no water heer .

And it´s gonna be , Our last memory . And it´s led me on , And on to you ... Accuse me , Trust me , I never knew , That you were the one , You were the one ... 
I'm really annoyed at you , facebook . Fix yourself !!! I can't do anything ... or play your stupid games . Grrr ..... 
Hum ... looks like my facebook has fixed itself ...

You don't realise how much I need you . Love you all the time and never leave you . Please come on back to me . I'm lonely as can be . I need you . -The Beatles , ' I Need You ' . Pressed shuffle on iTunes and hit play , and this is the first song .

I think it's hilarious when people say they're from Detroit when they live more than half an hour away from the city , and stay out of it as much as possible . Fail . 
I'm slowly ... very slowly ... recovering . Hopefully I can get some sleep ... 
We sense that life is a dark comedy , and maybe we can live with that . However , because the whole thing is written for the entertainment of the gods , too many of the jokes go right over our heads . 
Hard to imagine how crazy I'd be without books , games , and internet ... 
I wish I could draw like Yoshitaka Amano ... he's epic :) 
When will I ever get betterrrrrr .... 
Quit roaming my dreams , I thought I was done thinking of you ... 
UPS man ... Dally not ! 
So , my thoughts : Modern Warfare 2 story mode was a little bit shorter than the first ( about 5 hours , 15 minutes this go-around ) but soooo much better . Unfortunately , the ending makes it very very likely there will be another game . I'm excited for that , but , hopefully it is the last . 
If I fell in love with you , would you promise to be true , and help me understand . ' Cause I've been in love before , and I found that love was more , than just holding hands . 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time , ' till touch down brings me round again to find , I'm not the man they think I am at home . Oh no no no I'm a rocket man , rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone . 
The neighbors said she moved away , funny how it rained all day . I didn't think much of it then , but it's starting to all make sense . Oh , I can , see now , that all of , these clouds , are following me in my desperate endeavor , to find my whoever , wherever she may be ...

Is it time to start the countdown yet ? 
I'd like to move , out of this place ... Change my name , maybe get a new face ... Sleep all day , stay up all night ... Everybody I meet thinks I'm alright ... 
Met a girl , introduced myself ... Asked her to go with me , and no one else ... she said , ' I'd really like , to see you every day ... but I'm afraid of what my friends might say ... ' 
Sometimes the hardest thing in the world is to let go , and let things pan out the way they're supposed to . The future doesn't need to be planned , each day should be appreciated for its potential to be amazing , not dreaded for its potential to be disastrous . 
I'm curious as to how my fingers smell like syrup , when I haven't had pancakes or waffles in months , possibly a year ... 
That baby don't look like me . 
The snow swirls , joins its fallen brothers on the ground . The wind shrieks and dies , the sun runs and hides ; silence abounds . 
The cold air stirs , the bleary sun slowly ascends . The icicle drips , drips , drips , it never ends . 
The snow crunches underfoot , the man shields his eyes . The sun shines off the snow , lighting up the skies . 
He turns back for a last look , the cabin's barely there . A heavy sigh , he turns around , nothing is everywhere . 
The man shivers , could it get any colder ? This long trek he's on will make him much older . 
He's been traveling since green was the earth . The dream he has had , has shown him his worth . 
In the blink of an eye , there's a storm everywhere . Still he must go on , he cannot despair . 
The day wears on , the light grows dim . The man shivers , it gets colder , what will happen to him ? 
Perhaps this journey was a mistake , one very grave . Then out of the fog , a cabin , tonight he is saved ! 
Knocking ; a dark sillouette through the peephole in the door . She opens up quickly , not caring who for .

Shit , just realized I missed Muse on SNL tonight >.< NOOOOOOO ! 
What's up with my sense of time ? This day went by so fast , wow . 
You all love me . Stop lying to yourselves and just admit it ;)

Birthday birthday birthday ! * shakes butt * YEAH ! ;D

I'm going to be late ... as usual ... Lol . Also , < PROPMALE > decided that New Years < PROPFEMALE > is now Zackmas , my own personal holiday ! So , everyone , Happy Zackmas !! Let's bring in the New Year with style ! 
Hope everyone is having a good 1/1/11 :) 
So , anyone know how to fix ' Error 101 ( net :: ERR_CONNECTION_RESET ): Unknown error' ? I can't access dattebayo.com ( and another site or two ) even though I could a little bit ago . I've tried everything I could find , and nothing's working . The websites do not work with any other browser ( using Chrome ) . Any help would be much appreciated , thanks :) 
I really love good thinking more . I never sleep , ever ; I long still for it . ( See top word app , haha ! ) 
Reading my all-time favorite book series again ... for the 3rd time :) 
* siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh * 
I think I'm slowly getting over this whole being sick thing . Of course , right after I start to feel better from my sinus thing/cold/whatever it was , I catch some stomach thing . UGH ! 
Mom's been in the hospital for a couple days now , as far as I know they still don't know what's wrong with her . Been spending a good half to three quarters of my days there , sorry I haven't been online : x 
CT scan revealed that she's got colitis , and cysts on her ovaries . They've got her on antibiotics , although if the colitis was viral , it's not going to help any . Going in later today , hopefully I'll have more information . A colonoscopy is scheduled for sometime Monday , so at the earliest she'll be home Tuesday , but that's only if everything's ok . 
Alright , doctor said it does NOT look like Crohn's , but the biopsy will tell for sure . Probably not , so that's good . She's on antibiotics and a steroid right now , she's coming home tomorrow ! They're going to leave the cysts on the ovaries alone , I guess if one ruptures they said to come to the ER but they don't seem very worried . Whew ! Thanks everyone for your well wishes , I really appreciate it :) * hug * for all ! :) 
Mom came home yesterday afternoon , still no word on the biopsy yet , but she's doing better . It's nice having her back :)

* sigh * I need to stop watching movies like The Proposal . Love romantic comedies , but when it's over , I'm always slightly depressed , lol . 
Got back from seeing ' The Book of < PROPMALE>' . I really liked it ! Also , Denzel Washington is so badass , and this movie did not make me think any differently ;D 
I want another rat :(

Happy Winter-een-mas ! 
Got back a little bit ago from dinner and drinks with < PROPMALE > Ciemniak , awesome catching up ! ... On a side note , absolutely <3 < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! :D 
Why are some of life's simplist things often the most difficult ? 
I saw Avatar ... I thought it was pretty awesome . Longest movie I've seen in a looong time though . Sorry Hanne , I liked it :P 
Just when you think you've achieved another plateau , you realize that there's another whole mountain ahead of you ... 
* Gaz voice * Let's do dis . 
It's February ... which means BioShock 2 isn't far away !!! 
You ain't no weeble-wobble . 
Generic doctor and Psychiatrist think they know what's better for my mom than the G.I. doctor . HELLO ?!? She has colitis ! God , it's ridiculous ! I'm so mad that she's being treated like this . 
One of these days I'm actually going to go to bed at a reasonable hour and get some sleep already ... 
I'm sick and tired of hospitals . I don't even have the energy to bitch about what happened , it's ridiculous . Needless to say , mom's home . 
I'm bouncing around like crazy ! I'm fine with caffeine , never had an issue , but sugar seems to do it for me <_< I had a Dr. Pepper accidentally from Taco < PROPFEMALE > ... WHEEEE ! 
What exactly is Foo , and why are they fighting it ? 
Hanne Leetface Hansen and I are just too awesome for others to understand . * nodnod * 
I haven't noticed a change in Facebook ... why is everyone saying it's changed ? Looks and feels just as crappy as it did before <_< 
I just absolutely LOVE getting dragged into shit that I have nothing to do with . I really appreciate being dragged through the dirt just for being there . Fuck you . 
I'm so sick and tired of all the damn drama ... How the hell do I always end up in the middle of it all ? It's ridiculous ... Well , Ari's living with his dad now . The house feels empty ... I miss my little brother . 
Things still suck , but at least I made $10 betting the Saints would win . 
Okay , today just got a hundred times better . Got my < PROPFIRST > R . R . < PROPFIRST > books , AND Secret of < PROPFEMALE > in the mail today . Yesssss ! 
Hum . Secret of < PROPFEMALE > had save files when I first loaded it ... Went to save a new file , no save files there ... Turned it off , turned it back on later and no files . Internal battery's dead ... Read online that if you leave it on for a long time , it'll recharge the battery . Hope so , I'm giving it a shot . 
Is off to play Bioshock 2 ! <3 
... would you kindly ? 
All the what-ifs and what-could-have-beens are getting me down ... 
Random night outings are fun ! :) 
Insanse . 
/haet . 
Ideas be swimmin ' in my head . Perhaps my creative juices have been awakened ... Will I write again ? :o 
Grah . Need my checks ... I need to buy an internal battery for Secret of < PROPFEMALE > ... I've had the game like two weeks , and can't play it ! X_X 
Shutter Island was great !!! 
I don't think I've ever looked forward to a weekend as much as today ... and it's still Sunday , more or less :P 
Is it just me , or is everything going ridiculously slow ? Maybe it's because I'm looking forward to my checks coming ( whenever they come !! ) and Friday ! :) 
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart , I want to recognize your beauty's not just a < PROPFIRST > ; I want to exorcise the demons from your past , I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires of your heart . <3

Symbolism and allegory . 
Devil's got your pantyhose on his head , Oh yeah , and he's < PROPFEMALE>' me but all i got is cornbread . Well , you turn my body into a crutch , And now i'm limpin ' all over when i feel your touch ... oh yeah . 
Really happy , and also really upset . Damn checks ! I haven't been paid in over two months (>_<) * facedesk * 
I absolutely love The Beatles <3 
Got into a car accident at 7pm today ... Was stopped at a red light in the right turn < PROPFIRST > , waiting for a green to turn , Mom and Ari were with me . All of a sudden , out of nowhere , I get hit from behind by someone going like 30mph , and slammed into the guy in front of me . Ended up going to the hospital with Mom , spent 4.5 hours in the ER altogether . 
Thanks for the well-wishes , everyone . I'm getting my knee checked out tomorrow ... We'll see what's going on . I'm pretty sore , especially my neck now , which has me a little worried . But mom's taking care of everything related to appointments and such ... Thankfully . I don't know how I would be able to deal with it all without her :( 
Just visited the knee doctor ... walked away with a knee brace , an electrode ... thing ... and a hot/cold water treatment ... thing ... I have no idea how to describe them . Also , three different medications . Wow . I had no clue that my knee was this bad ... Also need to get an MRI . So we still don't even know the extent of the damage . 
* facedesk * 
Byooooooooooooooooooooooooo ... 
When the < PROPFEMALE > fell in love with the sun , All was < PROPFEMALE > in the sky , All was < PROPFEMALE > when the day met the night . When the sun found the < PROPFEMALE > , She was drinking tea in a garden , Under the green umbrella trees , In the middle of summer . When the < PROPFEMALE > found the sun , He looked like he was barely hanging on , But her eyes saved his life , In the middle of summer ... 
But do , give , just give me today . Or you , will , just scare me away ... 
GOOOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING VIETNAAAAAAAAAM !

Don't don't cry for superman 
MY CAR , SHE IS BACK ! * love * 
On another day c'mon c'mon , With these ropes tied tight can we do no wrong . Now we grieve ' cause now it's gone , Things were good when we were young . 
Whatever tomorrow brings , I'll be there , with open arms and open eyes , yeah . Whatever tomorrow brings , I'll be there , I'll be there .... 
Follow up to the knee doctor today , I've got a tear in my ACL . Knee surgery soon ... dunno when yet , probably mid-late April though ... 
I just ... I win . That's all there is to it . 
The faster we're falling , We're stopping and stalling , We're running in circles again . Just as things were looking up , You said it wasn't good enough . But still we're trying one more time . 
This is the story of a girl , who cried a river and drowned the whole world ; and while she looks so sad in photographs , you absolutely love her- when she smiles :) 
THE SONG OF MY PEOPLES

YES ! Victory for MSU ! :D Final four , baby !

7 years ago today , Square and it's rival Enix merged ; many people assumed it was an April Fool's Joke :P 
I just spent an hour and a half in a boss fight I was supposed to lose , doing between 75,000 - 100,000 damage ( Most health on a PC is 240ish ) before I ran out of the equivalent of Phoenix Downs and my healer was toast . Testament to my awesomeness ? ;D 
Wouldn't've looks cool . More words should have two apostrophies * nod * 
I gotta say , today was a pretty awesome day :) 
What , is it back-to-handhelds time for me ? Beat Lunar on PSP yesterday , now I'm going back and finishing Spirit Tracks for DS . Weird , I don't beat games all that often , lol :P 
is smiles and music notes ?? :) 
Everything keeps piling on and on ... what's next ? At least I still have something to smile about ... :) 
Wehell , getting $900 again instead of $800 , and it's possible I'll get it Saturday ! ( though more likely Monday ) Woo ! Things are starting to look up ;D 
We'll dig up the box ! ( the box ! ) We know it's full of precious booty ! Burst open the locks , and then we'll say HURRAY ! 
Hrmf .

Mrph . 
A cloud of eiderdown , draws around me softening the sound . Sleepy time when I lie , with my love by my side , and she's breathing low . And the candle dies ...

Knee surgery :'( 
Thank you everyone for the well wishes ! The surgery went well , the doctor said that everything went as well as it could , which is good :) I'm resting , keeping my leg up and iced . It hurts , but that's to be expected , heh . I'll keep you posted :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Fisher is awesome :3 
has a raccoon , courtesy of the most awesome girl in the world ;) I need a name for him though : x 
It doesn't all make sense , but I should have known . 
I dunno , fb . My mind's kinda blank right now . What IS on my mind ? Blank ? What exactly IS blank ? Is it a tangible thing ? Or is it the abscence of all things ? 
Being laid up really sucks . The days are all melting together , it's Thursday already ! Knee's getting better , slowly , but I still can't walk . At least sleep is a bit more comfortable . 
Blaaaaaaaah . 
My Great-Grandpa < PROPFIRST > died today ... 90 years old . He was a great man . I respect him a lot ... He got to see the world ! I think I'd be satisfied with my life doing only half the things he did . I'm going to miss you ... 
I'm a guy . Since when do we get anything right the first time ? 
Sigur Rós . 
Perhaps it's best if I get more sleep . I think I /moodswing when I'm tired , I've been alternating mopey/happy all day ... 
Ugh . 
Frustrated . Today was not my day . 
Thank god for Sigur Rós . I think I'd be full-blown crazy by now if not for them . 
I'm scruffy , I have a cane , and I'm on Vicodin ... Good god , I'm House ! All I need is a medical degree ! 
Hush ye , woman ! 
Baby I've been here before , I've seen this room and I've walked this floor , You know , I used to live alone before I knew yah . I've seen your flag on the marble arch , And love is not a victory march , It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah ...

Let's go where the Earth's crust is thinnest and resonate with the world ~ 
Mogwai <3 
is Zen . 
For some reason , \We're No Here\ " by Mogwai totally resonates with me . Is it weird to resonate with a song with no lyrics ? I have no clue . " 
Ah ... Music . 
Ah , thank god for the rain ... Cool things down for the night . 
PIZZA LAZAHS ! Fyoo , fyoo fyoo ! 
Unimpressed with Birth by Sleep's release date . 
Seems like things are starting to pick up . Cool . Hate being bored . 
Rain , rain , go away- Wait , no , I like you . Stay . 
Blah ... Think later on today I'll take a nice nap ... 
Sleep ... How wonderful your embrace is ... 
To all the mothers out there , I just want to say thank you , thank you for everything . Happy Mother's Day ! And a special Happy Mother's Day to all those who recently became , or soon will be , mothers of their own . :)

Note to self : Check the computer chair if it's dark . Poor < PROPFEMALE>'s going to be even more terrified of me now <_<;

Yeah you , got that somethin ' , I think you'll understand . When I , say that somethin ' , I wanna hold your hand ~ 
So , phone's pretty much a goner . Screen's black , everything's wonky . Can't make calls , and I know I have a text or three on it , it keeps trying to remind me with a little half-second vibrate ( usually it's 3 long ones ) . It makes me think of a little lizard inside an egg , trying to get out , but unsuccessfully . Lol :P 
I am wearing headphones . Do not talk to me . Truer words were never spoken . 
Summer = fail . I want to live someplace where the weather doesn't rise above 70 and there are no mosquitoes . 
Hrm . 
thinks it'd be pretty awesome to have an paranormal experience to talk to people about . Just a thought . 
So I'm staring at the ceiling last night , trying to go to sleep ... And there's a spider about the size of my thumbnail running around my ceiling , pretty much in circles . And I think to myself , ' Hmm . I wonder if that's what we're doing in life . Just running around in circles . ' And of course my next thought was , ' Man , how cool would it be if I could walk up walls and on the ceiling and stuff!!' 
I dunno what it is about the show , but I absolutely love Pawn Stars ! 
Oh yes . Beck . Gotta love it !!! So sad next week is the season finale of Glee :'(

Good to be home ! Not leaving the house unless absolutely necessary ... And people wonder why I hate summer . 
Fat guy in a little coat ~ 
Wow . The Avatar series is amazing , finally finished the whole thing . Definitely awesome . Although at times ( particularly in Books 2 and 3 ) it gets way more mature than the supposed 6-11 year old demographic !

* sigh * People are still fighting over the Islamic Community Center being built 2 blocks from Ground Zero . I'm in favor of it , it shows that this really is a country with freedom of religion .

Thanks for thinking of me today , everyone . I'm really banged up , but so far , I don't think there's any lasting damage . Only time will tell , of course . 
I feel like the ending of the first < PROPMALE > book was rushed . Personally , I liked the first season better ; I know they deviated from the books after the first season . It was still good , though :) \ 
From the book , I think < PROPFIRST > C Hall does an excellent job portraying < PROPMALE > in the show :) 
A guy came in the store today , trying to scam us , and when we saw through the obvious ruse , he wouldn't leave . Blah .
