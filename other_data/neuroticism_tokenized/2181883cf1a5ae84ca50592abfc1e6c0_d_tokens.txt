New term for illegal aliens ... Unregistered Democrats . 
New term for legal immigrants ... Registered Republicans ! 
While visiting the Sprint store I noticed a sign , OPEN-ABIERTO . My question : Why is it so difficult for newcomers to learn the word OPEN ? Did immigrants in the 1920s have bilingual signs or did they learn that Open means Open ? Think about this .

Left < PROPFEMALE > , Va for Georgetown University in Washington DC . TLC 2010 complete . 
I ran my ass off to find out my flight is delayed 2 hours . Why must the east coast have thunderstorms in 90 degree weather ? :(

On my way to BestBuy to get a webcam , add me on skype ! 
Skype or oovoo ? I like oovoo . 
Government should not be involved in marriage . For heavean's sake , marriage is a religious term and has nothing to do with gays or lesbians or any one who is not religious . As far as legal matters go , I don't care what the state thinks of marriage as long as they do not try to perverse the traditional meaning of marriage as defined by the church . 
God unites a couple in marriage , a heterosexual couple . Government , stay out of the church and stop trying to redefine marriage ! I love Prop 8 . 
just got the book , Arguning with idiots . :) 
Front < PROPFEMALE > of the Vally Sun ! 
I left my flash drive in one classroom , my English book in my history classroom and my history book in my English classroom . I guess that means no homework ... > < 
Power outage ... darn winds ! 
After taking a quiz on the CNN election center app for the iPhone , CNN has determined me to be a left-leaning Republican . Which means i'm a moderate . Which was what I was going for ... Yes ! 
My favorite Day of the whole year , Election Day !! Vote Republican for all California State executive seats , for US Senate , US House , and State Assembly . 
I don't think I can sleep tonight until I get all the results . Count ballots faster ! 
I didn't realize how long it took to count some of these local elections . Only 40% of precincts counted for State Assembly races . 
You get a strange feeling over you when you hear a power transformer blow up . What a way to start a vacation . 
It doesn't get better than old town ...

how many stacks of newspapers ( 24 papers per stack ) can you fit into a smart car ? multiply number of stacks by 24 , get the total number of papers and then submit that answer into the machine ... LA Times , very smart idea

In order to conserve pencil lead , please refrain from voting for me for < PROPMALE > Class President by bubbling in my name on the ballot . Why am I saying this you might ask ... well you'll find out when you look at the ballot tomorrow . And plus I need you to save the lead for next year when I run for ASB VP , but i'll probably be uncontested for that election too . :) Vote tomorrow ! It's your duty ! 
Parks and Recreation Season 3 Premiere ... I Love Local Government !!!!! 
SOTU ... don't bother me ! 
90% of Republican lawmakers in DC say the Tea Party should play a key role in national politics . I say Who are the other 10% because those are the only people i'm donating to in 2012 . That's right Tea Party Bitches !!!!! 
Give me subsidized food , mummies , curfews , looters , a dictator , and if you could top that all of with some freedom and a maybe a pinch of Democracy ... well , you know , it'll like eating a hot fudge sundae while protesting in Cairo , Egypt . Down with Mubarak , in with the mad scientist !!!!
