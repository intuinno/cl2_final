10 more months .... 10 more months .... 
I am strong willed , independent and outspoken . I make mistakes and I'm sometimes out of control and hard to handle . If you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . 
I have had a headache now for approximately 24 hours ... make it stop ! 
I am feeling mostly better ... Finally * Sigh * 
Life's Decisions . So I have just made a difficult decision but if you really love me you'll stick by me . I am not coming home for vacation . I only have 10 months till I am home for good and it just doesn't make sense to waste $5k when I'll be home 4 months later . I'll make up for it big when I get home ! Love You All ( well most of you anyways ! ) 
Took my first Migraine medicine ever wish me luck ... I am going to sleep * HUGS * 
Have you ever seen the movie \Groundhog Day\ " ... " 
I have a bunch of OLD employees who work for me ... Who don't have tattoos ... Their consensus is that they wouldn't have people with tattoos representing their company or tattoos represent a bad image . I pointed out that the smartest people in our company have tattoos LOTS OF THEM ... what I didn't point out is I have tattoos and I am THEIR boss not to mention they are about 15 to 20 years my senior ... SUCKAS ! 
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up .

And my dreams they left me \ 
And then I got stronger

AAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!! 
Ha ! 
#514 ~ When I first met you I thought you looked like < PROPFEMALE > ( what can I say I'm visual ) I love your sense of style and your words of wisdom ... even if you don't remember saying them . You know how to have a good time and can make me genuinely laugh out loud ! 
#143 ~ When I first saw you I was mesmerized by your booty ( again I am visual ) Just couldn't figure out where it came from your so small everywhere else ? I got to know you and by far the best thing you ever said was ' Oh no we are NOTHING alike ' ROFL ! I love that you are stuck up but not behind peoples backs you are quick to tell who ever it is whatever it is you want to say to them ! Not many people do that anymore . 
#102 ~ The thing I remember most about you is when you cut your finger off in the HMMWV fan !!! Thats funny now right ??? * GIGGLES * 
#3 ~ I think you have been dealt a hard hand and do the best you can with it . Bless your heart and whenever you get down look at your angels and remember your making a difference to them and everyone else can fuck off ! 
#023 ~ You may not know it but you have been huge influence in my life , whenever someone says that I can't do something I think of you and not only do it ... but do it the best . I don't have enough characters to thank you for all you did to build my character , self esteem , education , to let go of excuses . I am glad I could do such a small favor in return . * HUGS * Love Ya 
#26 . 5 ~ Though we are very different we are very much the same . We have faced challenges and tragedies nearly from birth and I am glad you made it through those very early ones . Your talent and sarcasm is amazing and I often daydream about sending letters to bands or oprah or something because I think more people should experience you . Thank You for everything you do there really isn't a price you can put on it . 
#412 ~ The leopard dress you wore to one of the high school dances I still dream of it :) . I always thought you were a sweet and innocent girl ( I found out later on facebook or myspace that a few locker rooms thought otherwise !! ) That you were a popular girl ! Your laugh and smile always lit up my day , and the slap on the ass at our reunion was a treat ! * HUGS * 
This < PROPFIRST > thing really is an eye opener ! You learn things you really didn't know . I am blessed to have such wonderful people in my life . Love You All ! 
#8675309 ~ You have both fabulous boobs and an amazing smile and I still owe you head ! Had it not been for you I would probably still be in Afghanistan hoping to get a flight out one day ! I only knew you very briefly and hope our paths cross again because you truly are a joy ! 
#09366 ~ Ultimate definition of a Lady in the Street and a Freak in the Bed . I am glad I could help you find that special place ;) Hope he's still not mad about that ! I love that you do things the right way even if right is the most difficult nearly impossible path . I pray you find the balance between the Freak in you and the rest of your life , cause to lose the Freak would be a pity . 
#005 ~ My oh my grape soju and the fact that you nearly killed me the first night I ever < PROPMALE > out with you . I would write more of that night but I can't seem to remember past < PROPFEMALE>'s bathroom till about 430 am ! Always lots of fun with lots of music and a great dancer ! And MARRIED more than me !!!! 
Found this out from the number game ... \In 5th or 6th grade you painted your face black with shoe polish . That was absolutely hilarious and I think about it every now and then even a zillion years later . :) \ " Jesus god why did I do that ? I don't even remember it either that is the scary part ...! " 
#273 ~ Your fabulous smile ! And I thought you were insane for quitting your radio job thing to move on to your next job ! Haven't quite figured you out , thought you were a religious nut but then discovered that isn't quite right ... an interesting intelligent person with many layers . 
Just a few more hours and I'll be home thank goodness ! 
Eventually , one day , something good will HAVE to happen for me ... I mean that's just statistics right ? 
Off to my first day at my new position ... :) 
88.72 on my 400 point final in Calc ... :( Which means I got an 88.7 in the course ... which means I missed an A by 1.28 point ! SMH

Apparently something I did in the class was worth Extra Credit ! So I got an A !!!!!!!!!!!! YAY !!!!!!!! Go Me Go Me
