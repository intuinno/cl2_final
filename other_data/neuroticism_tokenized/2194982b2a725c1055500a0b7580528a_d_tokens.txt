When we're tired , God makes us strong and He gives us the wisdom , to cope with our problems . 

Have you ever questioned your motives ? 
In \ 
the hopes of reaching the < PROPFEMALE > men fail to see the flowers \ 
that < PROPFEMALE > at their feet . \

< PROPFIRST > Schweitzer 
So \ 
often times it happens that we live our lives in chains \ 
\ 
And we never even know we have the key . \ 
- Lyrics from Already Gone , peformed by the \ 
Eagles for their 1974 On the Border album 
What is a sibling ? You could say it's a\ 
friend for life . Someone that will guide you even when you oppose . \ 
Yes , you can say that . You can even say it's the one that will help\ 
you up when you're down , but you can also say it's the one that , \ 
without flinching , would prefer to step over your blood which lies\ 
spilled on the floor , than to walk through a red carpet . 
It doesn't matter how bad they are , memories , are worth remembering . 
Have you ever felt like you're being avoided ? 
Happyness consists in the perspective . 
\Dost thou love life ? \ 
Hindsight only works on those who think rationally . 
Life's a roller-coaster , it's full frightening , mysterious stuff in the beginning , but once you get the < PROPFEMALE > of it , you really start to enjoy those ups and downs . 
While it lasts I'd better enjoy depression , ' cause there's no way I'm gonna make the same mistake twice . Oh well , in a few weeks this will be a funny memory . Thank God for life experience . 
The \ 
less men think , the more they talk . \ 
Baron Montesquieu 
It \ 
was a high counsel that I once heard given to a young \ 
person , \Always do what you are afraid to do . \ " \ 
There \ 
is no < PROPMALE > road to anything . One thing at a time , all \ 
things in succession . That which grows fast , withers \ 
as rapidly . That which grows slowly , endures . \ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Holland 
So many things are in my mind , but on top off all , right now is chocolate . 
I have an urge to make noise , move , or do something ! I've got so much left over energy it's driving me mad .

Acabo de ver glee ! 
Acabo de escuchar < PROPFEMALE > frase : \Soñeis dormidos con los que nos os dejan hacer cuando < PROPFEMALE > is despiertos . \"" 
If only dreams were real . 
University Gardens , would be a much better place if we didn't have to do an investigation . 
What am i doing on Facebook ?! I need to work , work , work ! 
When you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth . \ 
- Shinichi Kudo ( Detective Conan ) 
Why do humans always look to the sky ? Why do you try so hard to fly when you don't have any wings ?. \ 
- Kiba ( Wolf's Rain ) 
Perhaps the distant part of the sky always seems clearest , so that we will always strive to reach it\ 
- Himura Henshin ( Rurouni Kenshin ) 
It's always a lot easier to let something fall apart than it is to try to hold it together . \ 
- Yumichika Ayasegawa ( Bleach ) 
\Don't tell me he wants to conquer the world ? Can't he come up with something more original ? \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Inverse ( Slayers ) "

We are not the same person we where yesterday . Changes , they occur every day , every hour , and every minute . However , the situations , experiences , and changes that < PROPFIRST > new periods in our life , only take a second . 
How come that even tho I'm supposed to be overjoyed , tears of pain , sadness , and frustration , menace to burst through my eyes ? 
El carro me dejó . :( 
Por alguna razón , pienso que mañana hay quiz de Cálculo . ¿Estoy en lo correcto ? ( Digamen que no ) 
Reality is to much to bear without breaking . 
People are like sand . If you take a handful of it and you squeeze it too hard it will slip trough your fingers , even if you did it out love , even if you did it to protect it from the wind .
