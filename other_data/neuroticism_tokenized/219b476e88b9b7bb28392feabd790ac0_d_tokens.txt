Facebook is confusing ... 

OMG ! This is the second time in the last 3 minutes they put that abused animal commercial on with that depressing music . I want to cry . 
Question : Can you get in trouble for passing someone illegally if they call in your liscense plate number ? They have to have proof for the cops to believe it right ? Isn't it their word against mine ? It was really funny though lol 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes over facebook and texting =) You are fabulous 
I need advice 
Yay staying up late and having early classes with no sleep ! 
I skip classes ... =( Shame on me 
There has been a mosquito dwelling in my room for the past several weeks . I presume that everynight , as I sleep , he drinks a little bit of my blood . I concur that within a few more weeks , if this cycle continues , that I will go to sleep and never wake up , for this mosquito will have successfully sucked my blood dry . At this rate , that's the best thing that will have happened to me in awhile =) 
Best skittle combination = Red+Purple 
TIME , COME BACK ! 
The A*Teens are still awesome =) 
Man , those confirmation thingies where you have to enter what it says to confirm something , why are they so random ?? lol They actually say things that are just WEIRD lol 
Your welcome facebook ! I know , I'm just so popular =) 
IM SO PISSED OFF !!!!!!!! 
Wants to get this stupid criticism paper over with so the weekend can come . Can't wait to < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > and have neighborhood fun and go swimming and smoring ! lol . And can't wait for halloween . It's gonna be awesome , as long as < PROPFIRST > decides what he wants to doooo for it =)

Moove b **** , get out the way , get out the way b **** , get out the wayy . that songs still cool lol 
Mamma Mia , here I go again , my , my , how can I resist you ? =) 
If you're whole days mission is to get facebook to add a dislike button ... maybe you need to find new things to do with your life ... lol jk ... but yeah Idk what's the deal with that ... 
It's pretty annoying to get notifications about people you don't even know commenting on someone ELSES status . lol . 
< PROPFIRST > bought me sea monkeys =) I'm gonna feed them like 10 times a day , so they grow ginormous and escape and destroy the city ! 
Ok who else thinks it's hilarious the noise that guy makes as he leaps through the air randomly in that new Old Navy commercial ? Ha 
Grrrr my life sucks . I rear ended some psycho lady in fishhawk this morning . I hate the law that states that it's always the behind drivers fault , because in this case , it definately wasn't . Just hoping this lady isn't as psycho as she was acting and all she tries to do is use my insurance to fix her dumb trailer hitch . UUGGHH !!!! I really hope I don't become poor because of this . 
Why don't they have a like button for people ? That would be intense 
MY FACE 
Darkness 
Anyone know anyone who teaches piano that isn't too expensive ? 
I need more friends . And a social life . Anyone ? lol 
fml 
Is still very depressed ... I thought time was supposed to heal ... not looking like it's working ... at all ... just want this to go away 
\Buddy Elf what's your favorite color ? \"" 
I wish Facebook pages could at least have music ... makes me miss myspace 
Facebook .. I swear .. I WILL punch you in the face

So you try to put a fire out , but you use gasoline 
Entire day off !!! 
I like my < PROPMALE > =) <3 
Just want to relax , go to sleep , and forget everything , but unfortunatly I have to go to that hellhole known as my job . 
Siiiiiiccckkkkkk =( 
YES !! Cream-dried beef battered toast =) 
Tragedy ... has struck . 
STRRREEEPPP TTHHHRROOOAATTT !!! I'm coming to infect ALL of you 
It's time for you to choose , \ 
the bullet or the chapstick <3 
Can you say ... party time ? 
Fuck crazy ass bitches !! Fuck ' em ! 
I consider this world and all of the people in it lucky that I do not own a gun ... 
I must have missed the giant notification that today is asshole day . But not to worry , I was well informed . 
\I get such a hard on for clean rags\ " haha last night would have sucked closing but < PROPMALE > made it quite entertaining =) " 
Tonight should be interestingggg haha =D 
< PROPFEMALE > is ... 
Wow ... I have way too big of a heart . I found out my mom threw my sea monkeys away that I've had for about 8 months now , and when I found out , I got this heart-wrenching pain , as if I had lost a child or someone very important to me ... lol . 
Ugh FML . I hate how weak my body and immune system is . I'm going to have to start taking pills or Insulin injections because of hypoglycemia getting worse =( 
You ask why ?? I ask WHY NOT !!?? 
Have you ever wondered if there's more to life than being really , really ridiculously good looking ? 
And you can't blame a girl for\ 
stickin to what she knows ... 
I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right , you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . 
Damn ... I HATE never having money ... who knows an easy way to make cashhhhhh ??? 
Tell me why are we , so blind to see , that the ones we hurt , are you and me 
Looks like I'm gonna be having a LOT of extra time on my hands ... 
Next week is going to be awesome . Have something awesome planned on the 30th , and after that it's DAYGLOW MIAMIIII !!!!! HELLLLLZZZ YAAAA !! 
Change ... I'm going to make the best of my life , be all that I can be , accomplish the most , and be the happiest person you know while doing it =) 
Must suck to be < PROPMALE > in that < PROPMALE > Doesn't Know song ... 
I am surprised and scared about how many slang terms there are for having sex that I've never even heard of before-smashing , getting off the rocks , jaying , domes , etc . I'm surprised because there's quite a few ... and I'm scared because there's so many that I'm afraid I might accidentally agree to one of them thinking I'm going to be doing something else ... ha 
I move forward the only direction , \ 
cant be scared to fail , \ 
searchin perfection , \ 
I'm on to the next one 
It is quite depressing that there is not , and will never be , any kind of mystical magical creatures or worlds here on Earth . I mean , to think that I will go my entire life , and never be bitten by a radioactive spider that will give me spider-like powers , or that I will never go to a school of Wizardry , or have a vampire boyfriend while lusting my werewolf friend ... the thought is just ... demoralizing , what point is there then ? 
EPIC .... FAIL 
Somehow keeps getting it proved to her that she is better off completely solo , only worrying/caring about herself ... nothing else , and no one else . Plan ? 
DayGlow Miami = ... F*CKIN EPIC !!!! 
Life is goooood when you're always happy and havin fun 
is spewing hot volcanic ashes 
Somebody needs to have a party ... and invite me =) 
CUM -- It's what's for dinner 
I have an idea ... let's all take off our clothes and touch eachother 
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together 
I > You 
I misshh my boyfriend =( 
I miss high school =/ Don't get me wrong , the freedom and college life is great ... but things were so simple and new and exciting in high school , and your whole future was still ahead of you ... now it seems like the fun is over ... time to grow up . Not all of me is too into this ... Reverse Time Capsule anyone ? 
I'm starting to realise my indecisiveness is a worse fate than making the wrong decision ... 
It is not death that a man should fear , but he should fear never beginning to live . 
People are sooo disappointing >=O 
We are what we repeatedly do ; excellence , then , is not an act- but a habit . 
< PROPFEMALE > ....... Sucks dudn't it ? =) 
I fucking love my life . And I love everybody in it <3 
We do what we like , and we like what we do . 
I was gonna clean my room , but then I got ... =) 
I never cease to amaze myself by the things I end up doing in my life ... eh , fuck it =) 
It's crazy when you get pulled between what is the right thing to do , and what is the smart thing to do ... especially because you'd think they would be the same thing ..., wrong . 
is under the influence ... \ 
I love to be on bottom <3 
Weight gaining mission begins .... now ! Then I start tanning tomorrow , get my blonde hair back next month ... super excited =) 
L my V 
I really wanna play HALO with someone ... any takers ? 
The anticipation is riveting ... 
SCUBA < PROPMALE > !! DAMN YOUU !!!! 
This \Hair Battle Spectacular\ " show is actually pretty ballin . lol . " 
Get buzzed get drunk get crunk get fuUuuuUUUckeds upppppp 
Possibly the most ginormous Bat I have ever seen before just flew in front of my car in the dead of the night . Possibly one of the most terrifying things I have ever encountered . 
I wish I could just change the difficulty setting on my life to \easy\ " lol " 
Gaaawwwwdddd I love the Pretty Boy Swag song =P ayyyyy 
The happiest ending is no ending at all ... \ 
On a happier note I'm about to watch some Beavis and Butthead(I still love that shit ) , and wait to do somethin tonight . \ 
Yay weekend =) 
I LOVE MY BESTIE < PROPFIRST > Schmitt !!!! <3 
No one on the corner has swagger like us

I'm actually really enjoying this game ... the Bulls are killin it !! 
Making a new post because now my last one just looks embarassing ... lol

Sometimes kids make me wanna drive drunk on Halloween 
Who doesn't FUCKING love profanity ? 
Hahahaha . < PROPFEMALE > for the win ! 
And there's a million of us just like me\ 
Who cuss like me ; who just don't give a fuck like me\ 
Who dress like me ; walk , talk and act like me\ 
And just might be the next best thing BUT NOT QUITE ME 
I very much enjoy listening to good rap 
I just wanna party party party =( 
is a hardcore gangster . 
I wish I got as excited about my birthday now as I did when I was a youngin 
Thank you to everyone wishing me Happy Birthday =) I love you guys ! 
I love good moods . Yay serotonin haha =P 
I wish I could always say the horribly offensive yet hilarious things I'm thinking sometimes 
Oh , my love , my darling \ 
I've hungered for you touch\ 
A long , lonely time\ 
And time goes by so slowly\ 
And time can do so much\ 
Are you still mine ? 
Port < PROPFEMALE > ! Excitinggggg- never been , can't wait to see how it goes down in that town =) 
Where are you boyfriend =( 
Have they come out with a Silly Band shaped like a < PROPMALE > yet ? 
I hate my life when I know I have to go to work for the entire day 
Totally psyched about Howloscream tonight =) \ 
I can say now that I won't be scared ... but I know that's not true 
If somebody tells me to hide my kids , my wife , or my husband one more time ... I'm going to rape them . 
Working drive-thru can be brutal too ... I gave this lady her money and she accidentally stabbed me with her knifelike fingernail . I bleed . 
Trying to stay positive in hopes that one day luck and good fortune WILL be in favor of those who truly deserve it . 
Would you call Nyquil a beverage ? 
Oh temptation ... you devil you > < 
Screw you conscience , you never let me do anything fun 
People should wash their sheets more often .. 
likes cock . Lots of it . In her mouth . 
Can't be touched \ 
Can't be stopped \ 
Can't be moved \ 
Can't be rocked \ 
Can't be shook \ 
Came to get it right 
sleepy pills ... sleepy < PROPFEMALE > 
I should just start livin it up and partying instead of caring so much about what everyone else wants ... hopefully getting into something tonight , text me , especially if you want to party =) 
I'm too sexy for this post . 
NO I WILL NOT HAVE SEX WITH YOU !!!!!...... right now 
California Tacos = the shit 
Push me , \ 
And then just touch me , \ 
Till I can get my\ 
Satisfaction . 
You can't be everything you want to be before your time 
I love when I go back to my parking spot and realise that I parked like a complete asshole 
So sad that I've been missing all the dubstep events going on =( \ 
I will have to make up for it all in 2012 , it will be epic 
Who wants to let me pretend to be a part of their family for Thanksgiving ? Lol 
NEW NUMBER !!!! 813-753-8272 text me new phoneeee 
Work sucks sweaty nslld 
Work sucks sweaty balls 
A crazy rave this weekend would be sweet 
Gosh its so weird how correct horiscopes can be ... 
What's on my mind ? My boyfriend coming back into town :) 
I love that awkwardness of having nothing more to say to your hairdresser after about 7 minutes of conversation 
I hate bein a broke ass nigga 
Fuck the time 
Drug dealers are so unreliable 
I love my Corbin <3 
Last weekend of freedom before going back to college full time and working 40 hours a week ... and I'm sick . FML . 
Misses him already 
It would be cool if someone sent me a list of awesome techno songs =) 
I'd rather work hard to earn a paycheck , than wait to win the lottery 
\I bought so many condoms ... we could have a water balloon fight \"" 
< PROPMALE > the jewelry store tell em make me a grill 
. 88cent crunchwrap supremes at Taco < PROPFEMALE > ? Oh hell yea
