Whether you path in life is darkness or light there is good in all of us ... don't fear the darkness and don't hesitate to reach out to others and ask to borrow a 
Flashlight from time to time 
At the end of our time on this earth all you have is yourself ... so if we all die alone why is it soooo scary to live life that way ? 
I hate all this last minute stuff I feel like there are a million things I still need to do tonight before I go to sleep so tomorrow can be perfect 
Ok almost done just need to stuff stockings , do a load of laundry and assemble a train table 
It has been years since I have had a real christmas ... talking to my sister made me realize all the family I haven't seen in years 
Even during the holidays my pitiful little family unit can't even pretend to be a family 
Had a couple drinks with some friends ... feelin good n relaxed I think imma go to bed early 
Uugghh I feel like crap ... been tryin since 10 to fall asleep n here it is 4 n I'm still awake 
Ahhhh I hate that a flat tire is keeping me from being able to go anywhere !!! I'm goin crazy bein stuck at the house
