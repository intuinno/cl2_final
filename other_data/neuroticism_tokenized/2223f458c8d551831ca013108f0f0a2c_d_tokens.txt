Be careful when you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears . The woman came from man's rib , not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal . Under the arm to be protected and next to the heart to be loved . Copy and paste if you agree :)

tear me from the bone , tear me from myself ... are you feeling happy now ? 
if i fell would u still catch me , if i cried would u still wipe my tears away ? 
That's life , and I can't deny it\ 
Many times I thought of cutting out\ 
But my heart won't buy it\ 
But if there nothing shaking coming this here July\ 
I'm going to roll myself up in a big ball\ 
And die ... 
i think i have changed . i have realized more things about myself and life than i ever have . this week has sucked yet been eye-opening . i feel like i can start my journey on life as a new person now :) 
they say to expect the worst so when its good it will make it better , but if it is the worst it just makes it so much more awful ... =/ 
cant sleep to save my life ... hoping my nightmares wont come true ... this sucks 
Some things are over , some things are gone , part of me you < PROPFEMALE > , part of me is gone ... =( 
its mean to hurt someone but it's pure evil to just let them suffer when you can easily stop the bleeding 
Im sick of hurting . U could have helped me but u chose to let me bleed . Love me all u want , but i dont have a heart to love anymore 
Goodbye world of darkness , pain and misery i am done with your wickedness . 
i wonder if you ever think about when we were together . i have been lately and i miss you 
Someday you'll love me . Someday you'll care . Someday you'll treasure the moments we've shared . Someday you'll learn , love is not a game . Then you'll realize , I'm not the same . My heart will have left you , my love will have died . Then you'll realize the tears I've cried . Someday you'll love , someday you'll care , someday you'll want me and I won't be there . 
I am stoked for tomorrow =D woot woot ! 
I wish i had my appetite back , ive lost five lbs in like two weeks =/ 
... i am utterly confused ... 
Mushroomhead was epic ! i was front row . got soaking wet , i think they were aiming at me a few times cuz i got the water in my face lol . but none the less , epic !
