Can't believe she is sweating this ... 
Has a few suggestions for illinois : clean up the corruption in public safety , don't penalize law-abiding citizens wishing to bear arms , and bring obama home and let him deal with chicago . Leave our soldiers to defend rather than mend holes in your failed local governance . 
Passed all her practicals in one shot ! I realize that may not be a big deal to all , but i'm allowing myself a victory fudgesicle !

Please keep in mind that if you vote in the Dem Primary , you swear the following oath which forbids you from voting for a GOP candidate in November : \ 
\ 
\By casting this ballot 
looks like there are 3 times as many democrats registered so far as there are republicans in my precinct , and I'm hearing reports of this from disheartened conservatives all over the state . But don't worry- that's only because most the Democrats don't have JOBS . We'll show later today . 
VOTER TURNOUT IS LOW ~ Have you done your civic duty today ? 
Is getting her head bitten off left right and center . I'm retreating to my cave with a box of triscuits to watch the primary returns .

How long should one wait after a breakup to date again ? I'm just curious , as my opinion seems to differ from my ex boyfriend's . 
You speak in riddles , your intentions turn me old . I'm yours forever , will you love me when I'm gone ? -- It's a photograph discovered a decade after , It's a cannon blast disguised as a firecracker , It's enough to bring a brick wall to its knees ... Please . 
Shall eat nothing but pickles today . taking one for the team . * gag *

Dear < PROPMALE > Obama : Where is my laundry day bailout ? This sucks .

MSNBC is coming down hard on < PROPFEMALE > Palin for \undercutting\ " the State Dept tweet directed at Ahmadinejad which suggested he celebrate his birthday by freeing two American hikers . ...

^Charity is every man's onus . It is a beautiful thing , and should be given as well and as often as possible . But i prefer putting a dollar in a homeless a

“Have you ever been in love ? Horrible isn't it ? It makes you so vulnerable . It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up . You build up all these defenses , you build up a whole suit of armor , so that nothing can hurt you , then one stupid person , no different from any other stupid person , wanders into your stupid life ... ( 1 of 3 ) 
You give them a piece of you . They didn't ask for it . They did something dumb one day , like kiss you or smile at you , and then your life isn't your own anymore . Love takes hostages . It gets inside you . It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness , so simple a phrase like ' maybe we should be just friends ' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart . 
It hurts . Not just in the imagination . Not just in the mind . It's a soul-hurt , a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain . I hate love . ” - < PROPMALE > Gaiman ( 3 of 3 )

I apologize for the moody status updates . Funny thing is , it's not even worth it . I just need to get out of my own head and over this . Plenty of fish ...

there is nothing I hate more than when my daughter catches me crying .

God bless the countless families throughout Alabama and beyond who were and will be affected by yesterday's storms . 
Friends are going to network and pull through this aftermath . If you know of any reclusive people in your community , however , consider that they may not have the same access and opportunities . Especially the elderly . If you're aware of anyone who fits this description , let me or someone else know . There has been an outpouring of aid in Northern Alabama , it just needs to be pointed in the direction ! :) 
BARACK OBAMA DOES NOT CARE ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE /kanyeface 
When donating goods toward the tornado relief effort , please keep in mind that there are infants impacted as well . Formula , diapers , etc are being grossly overlooked !! 
Would like to know why supplies are being STAGED at < PROPMALE > . They STAGED plenty after < PROPFEMALE > too that never made it to anyone , that's why you can buy FEMA trailers for $10 now . Homeland Security has facilities right here in Calhoun Co . Afraid of actually HELPING ? Also , didn't FEMA just spend $1B on MREs and Port-a-potties for The Great Central US ShakeOut ? Can they not be repurposed and MOBILIZED ? ( 1/3 ) 
What a coincidence , FEMA stages a disaster drill for April 28 , ties up at least a Billion in taxpayer resources and then FAILS to deliver during an actual disaster THE SAME DAY ! ( 2/3 ) 
It's not < PROPFIRST > Bush who doesn't care about Black people or Obama who doesn't care about White people ... IT'S GOVERNMENT WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE * AMERICAN * PEOPLE WHO FILL IT'S COFFERS ! But it's not our money they're courting anymore . So send the aid to Japan and < PROPFEMALE > , right ? But hey ... if they'll turn their backs on SOLDIERS to play political games , does any of this really come as a surprise ? ( 3/3 ) 
Got stranded at home today , so I am working on a portrait of < PROPFIRST > C . Hall as < PROPMALE > and thinking of trying to auction it for the relief effort . 
Dude ... Osama Bin Laden is dead ? Pour one out for one's homies . 
Obama releases his birth certificate , kills a terrorist and aids in a National disaster all in one week ? I'm calling shenanigans . Watch this joker get re-elected . 
Bin Laden QUICKLY ' buried at sea ' before positive identification on American soil ? DEFINITELY calling bullshit . Wow ... SINCE WHEN IS THIS THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS ? 
\Finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world’s most wanted terrorist would have been difficult\ " the official said . So the U.S. decided to bury him at sea . Uhhh ... We would have taken them !!! " 
more drone trails today ... more tstorms tonight . And the beat goes on ... 
Dear God , I want to thank you for my beautiful child , my yummy bowl of Froot Loops , and a government so adept and efficient that we hardly even notice how adept and efficient they are !

I've carried my child within my body , Slept with my child on my chest . I've kissed little toes & wiped away tears . I've been puked on , peed on & spent sleepless nights cradling my child , but I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM , and there is no greater Honor , Love ..... or Blessing !! Post this as your status if you are a Very Proud Mom . 
Helpful suggestion of the day : When you're caught , that's it . Just give up . Or risk looking like the world's biggest asshole . 
And thus , my epic weedeating is rewarded with a giant bowl of broccoli and cheese .
