needs to get over this cold asap . 
Finishing up Confederates in the Attic by < PROPFIRST > Horwitz . Any recommendations on something similar ? I find myself newly obsessed with the Civil War . 
So , ancestry.com . Not so bad . Went looking to see if I had any ancestors in the Civil War , and found not only that , but ancestors in the Revolutionary War as well . Very cool 
got into UCLA ! \ 
On a side note , I can't help but be suspicious that this is somehow a karmic reward for spending an hour on my train ride back from Montana on just the first chapter of Social Theory and Archaeology . Lo and behold , I put the book down , somewhat unsure of my own ability as an anthropologist or critical thinker in general , and I check my status . Thank you anthro karmic beings , thank you . 
bought me a weddin ' dress today . 
\And must my name until I die\ 
Ahhh ! Accepted at UCLA , Albany , and Tulane . Did not foresee this happening !! Decisions ! 
I have dreams of orca whales and owls . 
All the good shows are slowly being dominated by highschool hockey and the 700 club . Sad TV

In Minneapolis , college kids play beach volleyball , barefoot , in the snow . I am not that hardcore .
