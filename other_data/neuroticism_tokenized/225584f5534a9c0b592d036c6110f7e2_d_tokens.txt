I am an instrument of the Living God . 
as God , He had every right to refuse becoming a man but yieled and did -- because He was willing . He had the right to be served by all mankind but came to serve instead . He had the right to live in peace & safety but willingly laid down His life . He even willingly endured the grueling torture of the cross ; He loved , cooperated , and did His Father's will instead of His own ... now will you ? 
Blackbird singin in the dead of night , take these broken wings and learn to fly . 
Last night of the pirate show ; Gods gonna shift so many hearts with this one ! Cheers to all who participated in this amazing show !

The stable wasn't clean & the cobblestones were cold & < PROPFIRST > full of grace with the tears on her face had no mothers hand to hold . It was a labor of pain , it was a cold sky above , but for the girl on ground in the dark with every beat of her beautiful heart it was a labor of love . 
fuzzy christmas socks , presents wrapped , carols & candles ... now it's time for the Polar Express ! 
< PROPFIRST > , sweet < PROPFIRST > so strong yet so frail ; carried a baby sent to save the world . Wise men will seek Him and find in Him peace ... < PROPFIRST > , sweet < PROPFIRST > tonight your < PROPMALE > is born .

Cause baby you're a Firework . <3 
Day 1 : I am a daughter of the Most High who is fearfully and wonderfully made , daily I walk and bask in the favor and promises of God . Even when I walk in the valley of death , I'm not afraid for He walks at my side , His trusty shepherd's crook makes me feel secure ; I can do ALL things through Christ who gives ME strength !! 
Day 2 : I am a light , here to bring out the God colors of this world ; better yet I am here to bring out the God flavors of this world ! I was born for such a time as this to complete the task He ordained for me . His plan is one of hope , to prosper me , not to harm me . With Him I walk by Faith and not by sight . I AM A PROPHET TO THE NATIONS !!! 
Day 3 : God is my provider . By His stripes I daily bask in His healing . Those who wait upon God get fresh strength . They spread their wings and soar like eages , they run and don't get tired , they walk and don't lag behind . When I ask it is given unto me , when I seek I find , when I knock the door is opened . His road is narrow , His burden is light . Love has saved my soul ; I run toward Him , His light leads me Home . 
Day 4 : I am the redeemed of the Lord . All power is given unto my Lord , my Friend , my Savior . He calls me friend : I am my Beloved's and He is mine . Daily I bask in His healing , His blood has saved me . It is no longer I that lives in me , but Christ . Love has saved me ; to LOVE is to recieve a glimpse of Heaven . Daily I cry ' Holy ' to God Almighty . Here I am , SEND ME ! 
prayer is like oxygen for the soul . 
Day 5 : I am being made perfect in every good work to do God's will . No weapon formed against me shall prosper . I am increasing abounding in love . I am His daugher , made in the image of God ; in His likeness . I am blessed when I come in and blessed when I go out . I have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon my life continually . His blessings on me are great and overwhelming ; His mercies for me are new each morning . 
Ohhhh it's gonna be a long night working on decor stuff for Youth . Coffee ? Check . KOL ? Check . Here . We . GO ! 
Day 6 : I am an heir of Christ and a joint heir with Christ , I have absolute freedom because the Son has made me free . I am strong and of good courage ; for the Lord my God is with me wherever I go . I am His daughter . I find life and receive favor from God . He is for me , He will never foresake me . On Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand . 
Day 7 : Today is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad . I am given exceedingly great and precious promises and by them I am a partaker of God's diving nature . I am fearfully and wonderfully made born for such a time as this ready and willing to follow Him wherever He goes . Here I am Lord , send me . I have been given the Spirit of wisdom and revelation so I may know God better . I AM God's property . 
Day 8 : God calls me His own ; I delight myself in Him and He gives me the desires of my heart . He equipps me daily to live out His plan He has ordained for me . The Lord does not give me a Spirit of fear but of a sound mind . I am blessed when I go in and blessed when I go out . Wherever He goes , I follow . He opens up the windows of Heaven and pours out blessings on me , I lack nothing with Him . 
\Who says you're not perfect ? Who says you're not worth it ? You've got every right to a beautiful life . \ " < PROPFEMALE > Gomez " 
Day 9 : Today , I walk in the Favor of God ; His blessing floods over me like an ocean . I am blessed when I go in and blessed when I go out ; He is my provider im I fear nothing . 
Glee , one day I will be on thee . 
Has something worth living for . 
\I am receiving all of my needs met according to God's riches in < PROPFEMALE > by Jesus Christ . \ " < PROPMALE > . 4:19 "
