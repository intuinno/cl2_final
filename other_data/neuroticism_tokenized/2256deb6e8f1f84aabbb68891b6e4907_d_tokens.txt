From the Wadena crime report : • A woman called 911 and reported that a man visiting her at her apartment had been poking her in the ribs while she was trying to do the dishes , and she didn’t appreciate it . The man left when she called 911 .

I'm sick of being sick . So are the kids . They have both asked if they are going to die and have told me they don't think they are ever going to be well again ! Poor things !

Why you should never tell people what you are naming your child until they are born . Here's a conversation between me and my mother-in-law ( Mary ): Mary : < PROPFEMALE > would be a good middle name . Me : We've already decided on a middle name . Mary : How about < PROPFEMALE > ? Me : I would think of a < PROPFEMALE > I know and don't care for . 
Less than 24 hours now - eek ! 
I suppose watching the SNL Gilly Christmas special would be sending the wrong message to the kids ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Murphy died today !? 
< PROPFIRST > bought me a Snuggie !!! 
I decided I'd rather be snowed-in in Minneapolis with family than by myself up north ! 
Do you ever confuse < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for a leprechaun ? < PROPFEMALE > does !!! I think it has something to do with the beard and the hat ! ha ha ha 
What if I said taupe ? 
It's WAY BACK WEEK !!!!!! Change your profile pic to a throwback picture of yourself when you were young !! Copy and paste this let's see how we all were in the way , way back ! 
< PROPFEMALE > has gained exactly 5 lbs . since birth ! She now weighs 10 lbs 10 oz . 
< PROPFIRST > took 3rd place in the spelling < PROPFEMALE > ! 
\Why is she spinning and why is she naked ? \ " < PROPFEMALE > says about Pink on the Grammys ! " 
Today < PROPFEMALE > learned that lesson many of us Minnesotans learned as a young child - never put your tongue on frozen metal ! 
Ok , Charize < PROPMALE > came up as one of my celebrity look-a-likes , but so did Donatella Versace !?!?! I don't think so ! ha ha 
It's movie line week here on Facebook . Cut and paste this to your status and in the comment box write your favorite line from a movie and see how many people know the movie and the line ! 
Very interesting talk given by our CO today . He was talking about avoiding entertainment that ignores the sacredness of blood and life and promotes vampire love ! 
I think I need to start a facebook < PROPFEMALE > called \My facebook status isn't going to change the world\ " . :) " 
Forced myself to go for a walk in the rain . I can't keep moping around ! I feel better now . 
< PROPFIRST > is trying to decide whether his catch phrase should be \Extreme is my style\ " or \ " Let's rock and roll\ " ! Where did I get this kid ... " 
< PROPFEMALE > giggled ! 
I saw a huge June bug today - and it's nowhere near June !!! 
Sorry low-carb , I can't take you anymore . Time to go make me a sammich ! 
I made chicken , mashed potatoes , and brussel sprouts for dinner . My crazy kids only want to eat the brussel sprouts ! 
Woke up to the kids fighting over which one loves me more . I'll have to remind them of this when they are teenagers ! 
Guess it's my turn ... I have a fever ! No , the cure isn't cowbell ! 
Sleeping in a hotel + < PROPFIRST > snoring = no real sleep ! 
hotel + sick baby = no sleep 
Anyone else have snow ? We had some big flakes falling here . Nothing is accumulating though . 
Sunscreen on my eyeballs makes me cry ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s tooth finally pushed through ! 
I forgot what a workout gardening is ! There is a new community garden starting in Wadena and I signed up for a 25 ' x 25 ' plot ! 
Another gem from the Wadena police scanner : \ 
• A man reported finding a rat hanging in his wife’s chair , and thinks someone put it there on purpose . The deputy investigated , and reported the rat had likely jumped off another piece of furniture and got its head through a slate in the back of the chair and < PROPMALE > itself . 
tornado coming ? 
We're all doing fine here in Wadena . There is < PROPMALE > damage in town , but no fatalities . We have no electricity and won't for a couple of days . It's really amazing to see the damage . I will always take a tornado warning seriously ! 
Thanks everyone for checking in on us ! I'm heading home now . Kids are getting antsy and < PROPFIRST > needs his coffee . I will check in again when I can ! 
Electricity is back !!! 
A county nurse was just here . She came to do a progress test on < PROPFEMALE > since she was so little at birth and since < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > both had developmental delays . For the scores , < PROPFEMALE > needed to get a 39 to be in the average range for her age . A 49 or higher would be advanced . She scored a 56 ! yay ! 
I made 12 dozen cookies and 4 batches of brownies for the tornado clean-up volunteers . Now I need a nap ! 
< PROPFIRST > makes me laugh so much with the crazy things he says . He just asked < PROPFIRST > \who's your favorite person ? \ " and < PROPFIRST > said \ " mom\ " . < PROPFIRST > said \ " my favorite person is < PROPMALE > Allen \"!!" 
listening to < PROPFIRST > sing his version of \Soul Sister\ " by Train . So funny ! " 
94% humidity and the temp will be 83 - another hot , sticky day ! 
listening to < PROPFEMALE > snore on the baby monitor right now - so funny ! 
I added pureed squash to the < PROPMALE > & cheese ( like < PROPFEMALE > Seinfeld ) and the kids absolutely did not notice ! Sneaky way to get them to eat squash ! 
Off to Itasca for the afternoon ! 
So , what was supposed to be a fun-filled afternoon at Itasca turned into an evening spent at the Park Rapids ER . < PROPFIRST > accidentally hit < PROPFIRST > in the head with a rock . It bled like crazy and needed two stitches . 
< PROPFEMALE > took her first steps ! 
grrrr ... special assembly day in the morning and I'm wide awake ! 
Somethings not right . < PROPFIRST > ate chicken tikka masala with brown rice and liked it ! I think this means the sun is going to rise in the west tomorrow . Watch for it ! :o ) 
That woman who was burned by acid made up the story that she was attacked ! She put the acid on herself ! 
Watching \Babies\ " with the family . " 
How did people put their crabby babies to bed before car were invented to lull them to sleep ? 
Laptop is messed up with viruses ! Grrrrrr .... at least my desktop is working fine ! 
If the temp goes past 75 today , my mom and I are going to jump in a lake ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is trouble now . She has learned how to climb up onto the couch and she is doing it over and over again !

< PROPFEMALE > walked into the room and < PROPFEMALE > said \Nay-nah ! \"!"

My kids winter break starts December 23rd . Are there any sledding parties in the works in the Twin Cities ? Should we plan one ? I'll bring hot chocolate ! 
Introduced < PROPFEMALE > to tuna today . She liked it ! She even liked the little peice of pickle I gave her . I'm determined not to have as picky of an eater as < PROPFEMALE > is ! 
Would anyone/everyone want to meet at < PROPFEMALE>'s for a sledding party ? It about 40 minutes from Minneapolis . I think it would be a lot of fun ! Let me know if there is a day that would work best for everyone . \ 
\ 
My kids have th 23rd-31st ( plus the weekend ) off . We could even do it on a week day . What do you think ? 
So , < PROPFIRST > wanted me to cut his hair for him . I told him that was fine , but I was exhausted and I was going to need a nap . I should have napped first - I accidentally used a #3 clipper on the top of his head ! I don't think I've ever seen him with such short hair ! 
Rough morning with < PROPFIRST > today . This rarely happens anymore ! < PROPFIRST > came and picked up < PROPFEMALE > . She was hiding with < PROPFEMALE > behind a chair . She was scared that < PROPFIRST > was going to attack her ! He's calmed down now ...

Long drive home from Fargo with slick roads and a puking baby . Glad to be home , but < PROPFEMALE > is still pretty sick :( 
Attended the Hudson Hot Air Affair tonight . It was so cool ! 
Having fun doing ancestry research . I was able to look at a 1900 census and saw that my great-grandma was listed as part of my great-grandpa's family as the housekeeper . She was 28 and he was 43 . This was before they were married . Scandalous ! 
wide awake ... aching because < PROPFEMALE > Michaels beat me up ... 
SIBLING WAR !! Copy this if you are the best and smartest of your siblings . If this stands for 1 hour without your siblings protesting , it's so true ;)

If you hear of something reasonable , let me know . Thank you ! 
So , I was researching migraines and I read a title that said \Oranges Can Cause Migraines\ " . What ?!? I've been eating at least two a day for the past month . \
