My throat is closing up AND I can't sleep .... oh , joy . :/ 
..... feels like hellllllll , agggggghhhhhhhh :'( 
< PROPFIRST > and I went up on the roof last night to see how bad the fire had gotten .... it is absolutely heartbreaking how enormous it is . My heart goes out to all the folks who live up there , and to the poor animals . :( 
thinks that no one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day ( thanks < PROPFEMALE >!) 
Who new the Lions could win a game ? Yay ! 
I have decided that I am unabashedly liberal , and I refuse to fight it any longer . This isn't to say that I like the Democrats , as they are a bunch of morons only slightly more desirable than their Republican counterparts . 
omg ... my body can't decide whether it wants to be hot or cold . My sinuses are filled up , my right ear is ringing ..... three days of this , can I be done now ??? :( 
What ? Really ? The Yankees are in the World Series ? How ... unique and different . * Yawn * 
... is still not over the last two weeks . There doesn't seem to be enough sleep to be had . On a seperate note , I pick TRICK ! ;) 
Today I am thankful for so many things : My finace ' , my beautiful family , my furry daughter , old friends ( including those getting back in touch ) , creative inspirations , new friends , my wonderful co-workers , my students and teachers , my Loft family , that I still have a job I love , my game-playing facebook friends , and , finally , that I am cooking my first Thanksgiving meal today for people that I love . I am blessed . 
A big thank you to my loverly Farmville friends for the beautiful gifts !!! <3 
I don’t know if there is an appropriate word in the English language that can adequately express how completely exhausted I am . :/ 
I just completely redid my FarmVille farm for Christmas . All of my FarmVille buddies are invited to < PROPFEMALE>'s Land ! :) <3 
Nighty night , Facebook friends <3 
I have been coughing for so hard and so long that I'm pretty sure I'm about to do a reenactment of the \Alien\ " bursting out of the chest scene . :/ " 
Does a man girdle = a mirdle ? 
I swear to god ... I now have a violent reaction every time I see a picture of < PROPFEMALE > Zellweger with her lips and eyes all pursed and squinched . If I ever see her in person , I may be forced to punch her in the face . 
Dear 2010 , Please be better and healthier . Lurv , < PROPFEMALE > 
Happy New Year , everyone !!! I hope you all have a safe and wonderful 2011 . <3 
omg .... I just died my hair and the ammonia smell tried desperately to kill me . Damn chemicals . 
Pass it on : The games generate a lot of posts which can be irritating if you don't play . If you don't want to see them , move your cursor over the game message and the word \Hide\ " will appear . Click \ " Hide\ " on the game name - and not on your game playing friend ! - Future messages from that game will then be hidden on your wall ! ( thanks for the great idea < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE >!)" 
Green , blue , teal and yellow . Stripes .

If you see one in there called \ " unnamed app\ " delete it ... Its an internal spybot . Please re-post for others . ALSO DONT OPEN YOUTUBE VIDEOS RIGHT NOW SINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING VIRUSES ....

Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Our wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is nothing to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... they've been eaten by dragons . 
o.m.g. does it ever end ???

The Hurt Locker just blew < PROPFIRST > and my minds . Seriously . I'm exhausted . Not for the first time , I find myself wishing we could bring our boys and girls back from there . :'( 
Oh , Facebook . Please stop logging me off , you are being a P.I.T.A. 
Way to go , Saints ! I am so happy for you and the entire city of New Orleans !!! 
Please take 10 seconds to thank a soldier for their service . It's easy , and thanks to Xerox it's free ... http://www.letssaythanks.com/ 
Hypothetically : If you really , REALLY believed in a cause , would you require a payment of $ 100,000 to support it ? 
I swear to ya'll , and this is a nod to my friend < PROPFIRST > , if I could just get Time < PROPMALE > into a room alone for 5 minutes .... vengence would be mine , ya'll , seriously . 
Thursday , Feb 25 - < PROPFIRST > it on your calendars - apparently it will be when the Repubs and Dems all get into a cage together and fight to the death . ;P 
Happy Valentines , everyone ! * Muah ! * 
Ugh . My ulcer is back with a vengence . :/ 
omg ! Facebook , you fussy , glitchy bizatch , get it together !

Congrats , Canada ! Well played ! 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , please take note : No one , and I mean NO ONE ' rocks the onesie ' . Thanks .

Thought the Oscars were overall pretty darn cool . Very glad Hurt Locker took it to the mat , ESPECIALLY awarding the first female Best Director ( WHOO HOO < PROPFEMALE > Bigelow ! ) . My only disappointment was < PROPFEMALE > losing , because she rocked that part , but < PROPFEMALE > gave good winning speech .... 
I wish someone would shove some healthcare down my throat . :p 
< PROPFEMALE > Bowersox is f-ing awesome . :)

FYI EVERYONE- There's a site called spokeo.com and it's an online phone book that has a picture of your house , credit score , profession , age , how many people live in the house , etc . Remove yourself by the Privacy button on the bottom right . ( passing along , scary stuff ! ) I personally checked it out and it is really there !! CUT PASTE AND REPOST !!!! 
Help , please : I'm seriously considering going back to school , but I would need financial aid or grants in order to do it . I'm positively overwhelmed trying to find info , and most of it seems scammy or bogus . Anyone know where or how I should start looking ? Many thanks in advance ! :) 
A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe . He experiences himself , his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest , a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness .

“Divine things are too deep to be expressed by common words . The heavenly teachings are expressed in parable in order to be understood and preserved for ages to come . When the spiritually minded dive deeply into the ocean of their meaning they bring to the surface the pearls of their inner significance . There is no greater pleasure than to study God’s Word with a spiritual mind . ” — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá 
What is WRONG with the GOP ? Why , after all that has happened to us over the last few years , are they resisting derivative regulations ? It is mind blowing . :/\

Why am I freezing in Los < PROPFEMALE > in mid-May ??? It is wrong on SO MANY levels . :/ 
California peeps : This is a long shot , but does anyone have any leads on a good place to by soap making supplies ? I was just about to order online , but the shipping alone is $82 . Which makes me want to pass out . :'( 
Remember , Remember . \ 
For almost 234 years men and women of all races , creeds , national origins , and sexual , religious and political orientations have fought and died for the rights and freedoms the rest of us so often take for granted . On this day , let us give thanks for their sacrifice , and honor their memory . 
What a craptastic day this has been . :/ 
I received 42 pounds of soap base today . Tomorrow a new chapter in my life begins ... 
I miss the energy and good health of my youth , but the added wisdom and perspective aren't bad . 
Hi there , beautiful new friends and MLM lovers ! I have had so many new friends join me on my < PROPFEMALE > recently that I am overwhelmed ( in a GREAT way ) . The only downfall is that I can no longer see posts from friends and family . So , I have created a new < PROPFEMALE > where ya'll will have my rapt attention and dedication . 
I just did what EVERYONE should do on their birthday .... took a 2 hour nap , and it was fiiiine . :) * sigh *

WHAT is up with Facebook lately ???? Half the links don't work anymore , takes days to load , gahhhh !!! :S 
Hey vamps- are ya'll getting the white screen of death when you click on Vampire Wars ' links ( for XP points , chests , etc) ? Or , is it just me because Facebook loves me that friggin much ? * sigh * 
Ok , so my online experience was being seriously compromised by the hideously slow performance of Explorer . Someone suggested Google Chrome . It is AMAZINGLY fast , but then has none of the tabs of Explorer , even the Google bookmarks drop down is gone , and no spell function ( yes , I'm an idiot ) . Why can't I have everything I want , dammit ??!! :/ 
Happy father's day to all of you daddies out there ! I hope you all have a beautiful day !!! :)

How does this sound : homemade 17 bean soup with pulled BBQ chicken and spicy chicken sausage , along with fresh homemade cornbread ? \

Hi fellow gamers-A few things , first is a reminder that I no longer play ANY games other than Vampire Wars . I have been getting so many FV , CW , etc gifts and I feel bad that I'm not returning your kind gestures . Please send them to someone who can reciprocate . The second item is below ... 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Mitra , please eat a sandwich . Or two . On me . \

I played 23 holes of golf today . To say I'm sore and tired would be an understatement , but it was SO MUCH FUN !!! :) 
We can only help to revive Dracula 5 times a day ??? Boooooo . 
We can't be useful to ourselves unless we're useful to others . Whether we like it or not , we're all connected , and it is unthinkable to be happy all by oneself . Anyone concerned only by his own well-being will suffer eventually . Anyone concerned with the well-being of others takes care of himself without even thinking about it . Even if we decide to remain selfish , let us be intelligently selfish , let us help others . 
Anyone else getting the white screen of death for VW ? :/

Vamps - too funny not to share . I was hitlisted . I am level 110 . Who were the first two to attack me ? A lvl 14 and a lvl 34 . The 14 was feeling his oats as he attacked me 3 times . \ 
Ha ! :) 
< PROPFIRST > and I are on the 2nd day of P90X . Plyometrics is brutal , seriously . But , I'm feeling really , really good so far as well . We've been following the P90X diet since Monday as well , and today I am already down 3 pounds . PLUS , I quite smoking Monday . \ 
WhooooooHooooo . :) 
“We must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society .

Were you aware of some of Monsanto's other products ? Agent Orange , dioxin , & PCB . A dirty , polluting , killing chemical company now controls a huge portion of our food supply .

P90X . The workout that keeps on giving . \ 
Sore muscles and a broken brain , that is . But , still , feeling good ! 
Oh , Facebook . What kinda crap are you pulling now ? Where did everyone's posts go ??? :/ 
BE the change you are looking for . Do not look for it in the government , in the media , in the groups to which you belong , or even in your inner circle . Look for it within yourself . Don't accept what you are told , look deeper . Don't accept how you are treated , fight for better . It is then , and only then , that you can affect change outwardly . YOU are powerful . YOU are worthy . YOU can change the world .

OH . MY . GOD . < PROPFIRST > has a shark week episode on , hosted by < PROPMALE > Ferguson ( who is doing a GREAT job ) . They just showed footage , with the camera literally just about 5 feet away , of a great white biting into the back of a man's calf and tearing it OFF . \ 
SICK , SICK , SICK . I wish I could unsee what I just saw . * cries * * hurk * 
Food for thought : One of the claims regarding illegal immigrants is that they are taking good jobs away from American citizens . This may be true . But , ask yourself , how many more GREAT jobs do you suppose have been taken out of this country by our politicians ? < continued below > 
Oy . Fair warning to my fellow Los Angelenos . H . Salt Fish and Chips is greasy and bland . My stomach HATES me right now . :/\ 
Back to healthy foods and working out for me . 
Ok , seriously . What is UP with conservatives/Repubs/tea partiers and their ALL OUT ATTACK on the Constitution ? First the 14th amendment , then the 17th , and now the 1st . As if the country hasn't been destroyed enough , let's also shred the blueprint for our Republic . :/ 
I've decided that I'm not going to age gracefully . I'm gonna do it kicking , screaming , cursing , singing , dancing , and fighting . I may still lose in the end , but it won't have been a boring journey . :) 
Rock on with < PROPFEMALE > bad selves , MSU . Way to kick some maize and blue boo t-t ay today , boys . Well done ! :) 
Can one of my fellow actors PLEASE tell me , WHY in the hell actors like < PROPFEMALE > Kidman DESTROY their faces with plastic surgery and botox ???

Hey Academy - The Lifetime Achievement Award deserves to be freaking telecast LIVE . It honors a LIFETIME of work . Make time for it , you fools . :/ 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status . Let's get our priorities straight ! 
My heart goes out to the people of Japan tonight . Many blessings , and prayers for their safety . 
The news from Japan gets worse and worse . My heart is broken for them . I cannot even fathom this kind of destruction , and the hell on earth terror of these huge aftershocks that keep occurring over and over . I'm praying for Japan and all her people and animals today , sending all my blessings , good thoughts , focused energy and white healing light . <3

Hi all - my mom had a minor heart attack this morning . I was wondering if , and would appreciate if ya'll could send some prayers or good thoughts and good energy her way in Michigan . Thanks and much love to you all . 
MYTH #1 : It's only abuse if it's violent . \ 
Fact : Physical abuse is just one type of child abuse . Neglect and emotional abuse can be just as damaging , and since they are more subtle , others are less likely to intervene . \ 
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month . 
Prayers , good energy and thoughts needed one more time , pretty please and it would be so appreciated . Mom is back in the hospital . Thank god it isn't another heart attack , but she is having severe pains on her left side , left breast , etc . :'( 
Child Abuse myth #2 : Only bad people abuse their children . \ 
Fact : While it’s easy to say that only “bad people” abuse their children , it’s not always so black and white . Not all abusers are intentionally harming their children . Many have been victims of abuse themselves , and don’t know any other way to parent . Others may be struggling with mental health issues or a substance abuse problem . 
< PROPFEMALE > haircare . I normally would never spend this much on my hair , but it is in dry hell right now . Well , actually , it has been in dry hell for over three years , ever since we moved into this apartment building - something with the water out here , I think . It has gotten to a completely unmanageable state that I cannot deal with anymore . < con't below > 
Remember when teachers , public employees , planned parenthood , and PBS crashed the stock market , wiped out half of our 401Ks , took trillions in TARP money , spilled oil in the Gulf of Mexico , gave themselves billions in bonuses , and paid no taxes ? Yeah , me neither . 
The homeless go without eating . The elderly go without medicine . The mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised to them . Yet we give billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest 2% of Americans -- those who need it least . Only 1% of Facebook users will re-post this message . I am in that 1% -- what about you ?
