I wonder ... 
im angry because he had noone to be there for him in my stead . perhaps there is no more reason to be around if theres nothing to keep us . we venture on a perilous journey ... sights to see and countless adventures to look forward to . we only need each other and noone else . he is all that i desire . his fear divides my pain and pleasure . him and i shall conquer the world and show that forever is more than just a word . 
My booboo made me feel better >_< he just needs me in his life and nothing more <333 
I feel so evil LMAOOO
