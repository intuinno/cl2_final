cramming my face full of cardiovascular deliciousness , then watching true blood to balance out the brain explosion that is not-so-affectionately called medsurg . 
paperwork . food . sleep . repeat . man , i live such an exciting life . why thank you , nursing school . <3 
sleep is for the wicked ... now if only i could get about to being wicked . ): 
times change , things change , people change . reconnect , disconnect , over and over again . stability is impossible , change is inevitable , and trying is unavoidable . whoever said that the ability to reason held us above all other creatures was a fool ; it only slows us down and hinders any ability to make lifechanging decisions we have complete faith in . humans are the new amoebas , my how we've evolved . <3 
i actually washed my car , vacuumed it , and now i'm picking up the house . to keep busy . because i'm alone . just tattoo pathetic on my forehead and call it a day . 
clinical blew donkeys for dimes , but jersey only touches them for millions . can't wait for the weekend . 
draggin my sorry ass through one more schoolday before jersey .. and then the insanity begins . 
lately i've been ghetto blastin , so nope i don't need that rest . <3 msi 
sometimes i'm so retarded i surprise myself & have to step back and ask ' how in the name of the baby jeebus did i pass kindergarten ? ' true story . 
' i've come to the conclusion that when jersey mapped out their streets , they gave a crayon to an autistic kid and went from there ' fantastic jersey with fantastic ladies . 
finally home , and i got a hot date with some comfies . first day at mercy tomorrow , heeeere we gooo . 
just woke up an hour ago from a four hour nap , did up my paperwork , and now i'm ready for bed . jesus christ , school burns me out . 
clinical was so amazing today ; relaxin , then studyin over at < PROPFEMALE>'s before comin home to harass the other half . (: 
today is one of those days where i wouldn't trade my life for anything else ; my mother completes my ridiculousness . (: 
upside of anger is one of the most amazing movies ever . mamadre time , then time for the other half . sometimes i forget to open my eyes and remember how amazing the people around me are . 
i saw some time this weekend that someone said they believed earley had two of the same answers ; just wondering if it was tachy & < PROPFIRST > 5 & 9 ? 
watching true blood with the other half , going to bed , and dragging my robotic ass thru another useless week . yeehaw . 
today i learned A ) hitler had a shit fetish , B ) coke cleans toilets & peels car paint quite well , and C ) shit is , in fact , never JUST shit . (: 
i'm snow dancing like it's my job , and if the snowmiser were real , you bet your ass i'd be on a pole in snowflake pasties and a < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . good GOD , please snow . my fellow SPNs , i love you . haha . 
If I came with a WARNING label , what would it say ? ( Feeling brave ? Copy and paste this to your status and see the warnings you get ) 
frozen ponds and a quad makes for a fun day . ahhh . <3 
two hour delays make me ten sorts of happy ; showering then heading to class , then a four day weekend , wahooo . (: 
youuuu got what i neeeeed . <3 
some days i look at myself in the mirror & go ' wow , someday .. soon .. i'll be a nurse . ' , but more often than not i look at myself and go ' what . in the hell . was i THINKING . ' ahh , the beauty of nursing school ! hahah . 
here's to a four day weekend of cleaning the house , the car , dinner at cortese's , and working on nutrition project ; i feel like being rather productive , oh boy . 
cultural center tomorrow to help my cousin with kid workshops & sell tickets for an < PROPFEMALE > in wonderland themed showww ! 
shopping at oakdale with the mamadre , then dinner later with the other half . d'awww , vday is so gayyy . <3 
i .. feel like asshole today . project . in sweats . then home to do nothing but lay around . gross . 
sick , sick , sick ; cleaning the hizzouse today for the mamadre , then draggin my ass thru one more day of school before the weekend . oi ! 
house .. clean . dinner .. not so much done yet , hahah . lasagna , then making chocolate peanutbutter walnut fudge ! i feel like a little cinderelly today . (: all i need is some lil meeces ! 
dear baby jeebus , i cleaned , cooked , and did my homework today . that counts for three good deeds , so if you could please make me stop sneezing and sniffling to the point where my eyes are bugged out like a frog's , i would greatly appreciate it . <3 love , the little monster . 
i don't understand how people can torture themselves in silence . 
i miss my dj , spinnin beats alone just ain't the same . <3 
i feel like a hundred and two year-old in the body of a nineteen year-old . beat . 
as per the phonecall from mrs. < PROPFEMALE > , i asked her about the b vitamins and she said we need to know b1 - thaimin , and b12 pernicious anemia . just for those who thought we had to know all bs . (: 
hopefully enjoying a four day weekend playing in the snow with my other half n the grizzly . <3 
i can't believe it's been snowing nearly all day again . i guess it's just making up for the lack of snow we've had so far . disgusting . 
here's to hoping tomorrow will be better than today . 
ripping my hair out studying for the tests to come ; if i ever think about condensed schooling again , i will make sure to have someone slap me silly . 
dear summer , could you possibly come any slower ? everything about me is shot ; bed time . 
god please < PROPMALE > me the strength to not go on a rampage ... or to just not give a shit like some fucking people . 
good god , i'm so happy to be working ; exhausted , & glad i passed level 2 . officially halfway to being an lpn . (: 
good weekend , good night at work last night , and a great day of introductions to lvl 3 , penises , and vaginas , haha . let's hope things stay this way . 
tonight .. tonight i cut myself . on the serated edge of an aluminum foil box . next time , i need to remind myself to look before i grab , haha . sometimes i think i may need a helmet . 
... today is a day of perfect timing . my car made a flapping noise , so i checked it after i got home & found my tire had a hole . after that discovery , < PROPFIRST > pulled in & he has a tire plug . it's two hours before < PROPMALE > goes to work , so he & < PROPFIRST > can fix it before i leave . too bad i'm not < PROPFEMALE > , or i'd give < PROPFEMALE > luck all the credit , haha . 
work tonight & tomorrow ; come down & have a drink or fooddd . (: then hopefully finding a way to get out & enjoy my day off on sunday . 
today i will be wearing flipflops and getting enough vitamin d to sustain me for the rest of forever . bring on the fabulous weather & even better mood ! <3 
spontaneous brain hemorrhaging R/T thinking entirely too hard about careplans , nursing school overload , & stress over two tests before the weekend . HOW ' BOUT THAT FOR A NANDA ? stick that in your syringe and boot it . 
tackling a hellacious neuro test tomorrow , workin bogey's restaraunt from 4- ? come eattt , then possibly out to the LCI to see 2entysomething ... i really need more ' fun ' time . balls . 
i feel like roadkill . 
relaxing for a few , then running the lil bro & his < PROPMALE > to hartford , running to halstead to clean < PROPFEMALE > up , and coming home to get ready for work . bogey's 5-close , come see me ! <3 
it seems like no matter how much i sleep , i'm still exhausted . wtf . 
my family is amazing , hahaha . <3 showering , then lounging before heading to < PROPMALE>'s grandparents for dinner . hopefully squeezing in something else today , too . it's too gorgeous to waste ! 
i'm so cold i could smack a bitch . what happened to the sweet weather ? ): 
.. breakfast for dinner ?! need . i . say . more . hahaha . maybe it'll make up for shitty clinicals tomorrow . 
i definately should've been doing pathos .. but a catnap & the blindside > paperwork , NANDAs , and rationales . <3 
i just did so much paperwork that i now think i have an acute onset of carpal tunnel syndrome in my left hand . school , work , rise , and repeat , then working beerfest on sat . gunna be a long few days . 
i'm missin my jammin more than usual . ): spendin the rest of the night beatin on the other half with my bat o ' love , working beerfest 12-whenever tomorrow , then making birthday plans for sunday ! <3

i'm bringing in the new year sick , nice . happy new year , everyone . 
dear dentists , please take the sperm donor's insurance . i greatly need my wisdom teeth removed , & i need a referral to do that . on a better note , i think i'll clean some today because sitting here may lead to a quick onset of insanity . 
AH ! called solfanelli's office & they don't need a dentist's referral for a wisdom tooth removal , PLUS they take the insurance ! i've got a consultation on the 21st , so here's to hoping it goes well & i can afford the surgery , haha .

retyping my resume so it's on my laptop , then spending the day finishing up the last of the laundry & looking for more jobs . i feel like i was hyped up for an instant job in school , and now i'm getting shanked by the nursing field . bah . 
i'm putting an online application in for allied , & i wanted to know what i should put for pay desired . anyone ? haha . 
my car is stuck .. outside the detatched garage . in a foot of snow . time to slam the bitch in neutral & hope for the best , i guess . 
searching for new jobs and wondering when i'm gunna get thrown a rope ; not sure if i'm gunna < PROPFEMALE > myself with it or pull myself up yet . hopefully the snow holds off til after i get out of work & i can go plow with the other half . <3 
so , i went to unlock my car & hit lock , my door shut , and my keys were in the car . i then proceeded to call my work to tell them i'd be a little late , and i was informed i wasn't on the schedule . dear life , thanks for raping me in the ass at every < PROPMALE > you get . <3 
since i realized most of my last few posts are enough to make anyone want to pop a bottle of xanax , the upside is that monday i call to schedule an interview at carbondale nursing & rehabilitation center . (: cross yo ' fingas ! 
just finished filing my taxes , now it's time to grocery shop . ppd #1 , CLEAR . ppd #2 , scheduled for next wednesday , so hopefully i find out by friday if i definately have this job . yay !

Home now to bum it ; the shower was beautiful , the food was delicious , the decorations were gorgeous , and the shebang was fun as hell . Congrats ! :) 
Nursing class : if you have an android capable phone , or possibly iphone , check out the prognosis app . Adorable and helpful , or maybe im just bein silly . Haha . 
I just witnessed the beginning of a rap gospel song . My brain just exploded . 
My new addiction : angry birds . Possibly doing laundry and who knows what til the better half gets home from plowing . <3 
Im going to go crazy . 
I'm devouring books worse than a bulemic on a binge in a bakery . Unintentional alliteration just proves my point . 
Heard back , finally , from the nursing home ! They want me on board , here's to hoping it's sooner rather than later . :) 
I got the job ! 
Getting around and spending some much needed time with < PROPFEMALE > , then off to penncan .. ugh . 
checkin out apartments again today since i'm gunna be a nursey soon ! :) hopefully the ones in springbrook are still open , but a backup can't hurt . Then to tunk ! 
You fuck with my girlfriends , I'll fuck you up . Without warning . You'd best watch your ass , and you know who you are , scumbag . 
Shaking . I don't understand how people can be so inconsiderate and selfish that they hurt such vulnerable people . The dirt on my shoe is more valuable than you could ever wish to be , and someday < PROPFEMALE>'s going to make its way back to you . 
Has anyone else ever wished life was more like those kiddy dragon rollercoasters instead of steel force ? Or am i the only one ? 
Showering , finishing the last of the laundry , then heading to the garage to < PROPFEMALE > out with the boys . Whatta gooorgeous day out ! 
Possibly doing an nclex review and going to < PROPFEMALE>'s . Til then , happily shoving my face in a < PROPFIRST > Koontz book . :) 
I keep waking up with a bloody nose . I think my brains are finally leaking out ... and right before boards . Here's to drooling on a keyboard ! 
I love boomerang . Snorks , kung phooey , the huckleberry hound show , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . God , i want to be a kid again . 
It's 2:39 . It's friday . I'm free all day . And my boyfriend is coming home from work early . After working for a month of 10-13 hr days . I think i just shit . <3 
The Boondock Saints II is on . Mmmmm . Looks like it's gunna be a good day ! 
Well , tomorrow's the big day . Lil worried , but i'm in more of an it is what it is mood now . At least we made it home alright & had fun at < PROPFEMALE>'s :) 
Of course it would be like this on the day i have to test . 
Mmm , coffee . I hope today's a good day . 
I'm an official LPN ! Whoooo ! 
I feel like hell in a handbasket . This ridiculous weather is taking a toll on my poor sinuses . Warm weather , where the hell are you ? 
According to Froggy 101 , < PROPFIRST > Aldean is playing this summer . I'm officially selling a kidney for tickets and a backstage pass . His babies will be mine . <3 
< PROPFIRST > Koontz and some laundry seem to be occupying my day before work . I feel so ... domesticated . :) 
Using rolled change for gas and smokes . Thank god I work tonight & I start orientation next week . Maybe then this shit will end . 
I'm officially addicted to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s new song with Kanye West . 
The fact that work consumes < PROPMALE>'s life makes me want to cry . Hopefully some time with the second family & parade day tomorrow will help . Blah . :( 
Parade tomorrow with my gorgeous babymama ! Look for the girl with the baby shamrock on her belly & i'll be with her ! :) 
So exhausted , but I definately had a blast . People watch with < PROPFEMALE > at the parade mooore than made up for not being able to drink . :) 
Got me some coffee , now it's time to go play with tools and triaxles and pretend i'm helping < PROPMALE > . <3 
Gotta love getting kicked when you're down . Fuck you , life . :) 
Curling up with the peanutbutter to my jelly . <3 I think I love him more than pigs love shit . :) 
It's gorgeous , and I have to work . This calls for a windows down , music loud kinda day . Hopefully the good weather brings LOTS of customers ! 
Reading , laundry , mom's later . Debating starting to sell PartyLite candles . Message me if you might be interested or want more info ? :) 
I feel like Mr. Clean's wife . Befriending the scrubbing bubbles and dyson , then shoving my face in a book . 
Cleaning , finishing laundry finally , and then tying ends up to become a PartyLite consultant before my show saturday ! :) 
Nasty weather , good news . Office orientation friday , 7a-730p orient on mon , 7p-730a tues and weds . Gunna be a tired pup for penncan next week , but it's on ! 
Dear weather , if you make my ride into work a slip and slide , I will make my carbon footprint 40x bigger . <3 
My gorgeous neice was brought into the the world today . Waiting on a call and heading down to squeeze her diapered butt and love on her . <3 congrats . :) 
Headin to my momma's to spend much needed time with her and aunt < PROPFEMALE > and sell some smellies ! :) 
So many babies & bellies ! Makes me want one , and by that , I mean borrow and babysit . Haha . The world does NOT need something with half mine and < PROPMALE>'s DNA . Yet . 
Mom's early 21st birthday present : posting ollld pictures of me on FB . Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > . Hahaha . 
Thanks so much to everyone for the birthday wishes ! Wish i could get back to you all personally , but orientation's still dragging on . It's good to be a nurse . <3 
I hope I wake up tomorrow , and it's magically Friday . 
One more day of work , then it's the weekend . Booked friday , saturday , AND sunday night because my friends and family are , obviously , the shit . <3 
So , it's snowing , but I'm still granny driving to tunk today . Got a very important date to raise hell & flip a bar upside down with none but the best ! <3 
The last two nights have been some of the best . Thank you to everyone who came out , and those that didn't , we'll raincheck . <3
