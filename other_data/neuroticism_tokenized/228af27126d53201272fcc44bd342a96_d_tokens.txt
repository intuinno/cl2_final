You know you're graduating this semester when ... Instead of buying books , binders , spirals , paper , pen/pencil , or even back-to-school clothes , you simply stock up on Ramen noodles/PB&J and call it a day !

Sleep is a naturally recurring state of relatively suspended sensory and motor activity in animals , characterized by total or partial unconsciousness and the nearly complete inactivity of voluntary muscles . It is distinguished from quiet wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli , and it is more easily reversible than hibernation or coma ....

My Environmental Soci teacher is making me HATE the Env . I would rather set a tree on fire than listen to that man talk for 3hrs/wk ... 
Is SO over my environmental professor , I honestly think , at this point , he is trying to find ways to become increasingly obnoxious on a daily basis ... . 
I was entirely too productive today , I read two chapters , wrote my spanish literary analysis , studied for a spanish exam , started and finished my research paper , and got started on my data entry hours for the week .... 
So .... why don't we have nap time in college ? It should be a mandatory break that they pay us for , and then give us a free snack when we wake up :-D 
Is SO tired of my ENV class ! If EVERYONE fails an online test , perhaps it would be better to see which questions we all missed and TAKE THEM OFF , or explain those topics better ! Rather than letting us retake the exact same exam with notes/book . It's no big secret that we already use our notes/books for online exams . No big surprise , everyone failed again .... New professor , please ...

Never tell someone they aren't good enough or that aren't able to do something . People can do extraordinary things , even when no one believes they can . If someone wants to learn something new , what right does anyone have to tell them they can't ? 
Love is like a friendship caught on fire . \ 
In the beginning a flame , very pretty , often hot and fierce , but still \ 
only light and flickering . As love grows older , our hearts mature and \ 
our love becomes as coals , deep-burning and unquenchable .  < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST >
