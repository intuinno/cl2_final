I've gotten through some of the muck of school , but not quite all just yet ... I hope I can stay afloat . 
Pretty annoying , but pretty cool : The FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic crcles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works . after you follow all the steps scroll up or down ... then the circles will appear 
Is sick , but still alive ! :D 
Being sick and at school sucks ... Especially when there is a math quiz to be taken ;o ;

In phoenix to see TSO . :D 
Wishes she could get up on the roof and lay bundled up looking at the stars and forget the world . 
Just got my tickets to go see Wicked :D We're attending the very last show ! 
Rawr ! Only 4 days left to pay for my classes ! and I still don't know if I'm signed up for all the classes I'm taking ... You'd think 13 credits would be enough , but if I take one more worth 2-3 then my agec transfer associates would be complete ! ;o ; At least I think it would be ... O.o .. UGH College can be confusing !!! 
For such a developed country I'm surprised we cannot share our findings with those who can't afford the equipment to detect things like earthquakes ... My heart goes out to those in Haiti who are suffering unfairly . May the wheel turn for them soon ... 
Hard Blow !

Do Doo Do Doo Do ! MAHNAHMUHNAH ! 
Good evening .... INFADEL :D 
I might not be the prettiest or sexiest , may not have the perfect body or be absolutely beautiful . I may not be everyones first choice either , but I'm ME I don't pretend to be someone or something I am not .. I may not always be proud of some of the things I've done in the past , but I'm proud of who I am today ! 
Blessed Beltane for all ! <3 
\Today's the day to start celebrating the\ 
Going up to the top of Mount Lemon for Mothers day today :3 
Loosing weight is great and all , but a shrunken stomach is sometimes hard to deal with ;o ; :: feels blah from over eating :: 
\Let your life be your dream . Integrity . Honesty . \"- Blind Mag from Repo the Genetic Opera " 
Nother good day of Dungeons and Dragons . :3 
Last Final today ! Blech Math D: I just hope I pass ... 
When the evening's entertainment comes down to sitting one seat away from your friend as you're chatting on face book ... things in our world have become seriously weird O.o .. 
Summer session starts verreh Verreh Soon ! I'm hoping to make a visit to see good ole friends back in SC late July maybe early August . :: fingers Crossed :: And I'm busy trying to finish old projects like a latch hook that I've had since I moved to SC ? O.o ... dern thing just doesn't want to be finished I swear ! 
Yay for Cat sitting ! :D ( and house sitting ) 
New favorite song ! :D < PROPFEMALE > Bareilles , < PROPMALE > of Anything ! 
Experienced my very first out blown alergic reaction . Very itchy Hives over many sensitive parts of my body and the doctors perscribed me a steriod pack of pills that I have to take for the next 6 days . The best part is I don't know what on this green earth I'm allergic to D: 
Had a filling done today and the residual dull pain from the double sticking of novicane is quite irritating . Slowly but surely gathering all my things at mom's bosses house to return to my own . Tomorrow is my last day cat sitting for this period of time . Come life , let's dance you and I . :D 
Off to play real life farm ville with high school < PROPMALE > and family . Luckily there are not scotts in our group so all the sheep should be fine :D 
Just starting my jaunt into the volunteer world ! Off to learn skill sets useful for everyday life and hopefully some skills beneficial to job related activities later in my career . Let's hope it goes well ! 
Whoo ! Going to San < PROPMALE > , CA on the 9th-11th of July ! Mom and I are going to Sea World and to the San < PROPMALE > Zoo ! 
ignore those last two posts .. they're spam ;o ; 
Today was just bizarre O.o I was on my way to a friends house , turning under an underpass on the I-10 frontage road in a left turn < PROPFIRST > when a cop car comes skirting by my car half on the side walk and half on the road . ** He HITS ME ** ( which broke his left side mirror ) AND kept on driving without stopping to confirm damages or to even apologize . 
Back from SC ! I'll tell you , one of the most humbling experiences of my life is landing in a small 57 passenger plane during one of Tucson's Lightning storms and watching the lightning leave it's home in the cloud to come reach for you ... O.o It was crazy cool ! 
Hmmmm .... I think I've discovered my true underlying issue :D . Now how to fix it ... Guess I should first figure out how it got there in the first place ... 
< PROPMALE > out and watched The Box , Shutter , Teeth , The Good Son , Aftermath , < PROPFEMALE > , and Terror Firmer . Crazy night filled with fun and silly movies and then I arrive home to find a porcelain egg from on top of my alter had fallen without any thing else being disturbed ... CREEPY !!! O.o 
Today I went to West Campus to get some administrative work done for a class and all my effort was in vain because my teacher's email wasn't precisely what they needed . Wasted time there . Also , after that I went downtown to a cleaning job and all hell breaks loose from the sky on Campbell . 
Mmmmmm ! Nothing like a day full of organizing , building , and cleaning with your homework all ready to go for school and laundry almost done . It's been a good productive day :D Dad and I installed a bathroom organizer . It came out crooked , but now I love it all the more :D 
Okay ... This Saturday is Booked . Don't anyone else try to invite me to something XD cause I can't do it ;o ; ^^ ; :: hates how everything tries to happen on the same day :: 
Quadratic formula hurts my head when answers they give in the back of the book don't seem possible via process of solving that anyone has taught me thus far ... O.o ... :: is amazed at how people are allowed to write these books and get away with their mistakes ... :: 
When you get a math teacher who instead of helping you solve a problem , asks if you're sure you're in the right class , it's hard not to let your spirit die . To the world of Academia's poisoned minds ... go jump off a bridge with a velocity higher than that of Gravity ... 
Wonderful Day at west campus ! Sitting in a hallway with slow trickling traffic increases the chances of running into friends and acquaintances :3 Us smart people know the awesome quiet spots to sit/travel XD 
Put up some curtains over my closet :3 It was an annoying process but the finished result makes me happy . Now I just need a window treatment and I need to replace the shelving unit in my bath room that my cat decided to try and hop on . Basically it was wicker basket strength held by very weak woven plastic screwed into the wall XD 
To those who are against the mosque being built at ground zero :\ 
\ 
Do one thing for me ... Go to google maps . Type in Mosques in New York . Note the number of possible results that show . \ 
Then type in Churches in New York . Trust me that one more mosque , no matter the location , means nothing to the number of churches in existence in that teeny little state . 
I'm working Nightfall this year again :D just this time I'm a breaker ( I take other people's positions so they can go on break . ) Hope to see people out there ! 
Going in for costuming tomorrow at Old Tucson . Then I get to rangle all my friends into coming to a different location for D&D because my Dad will be flying out eary Sat morning and I don't want to keep him up .. ;o ; and Crawford isn't answering my phone call to tell him the ' good ' news of the location switch ;o ; hope he charges his darn phone XD 
Yay for staying up late making a mask ! If I like my work , maybe I'll go try and work for a company that produces horror masks and props :D 
Bwahahahah .. sleep nao ... 
Getting some mundane chores out of the way before tomorrow :3 Hope everyone out there is doing well ! 
What is it about brunette jail bait girls wearing overly white baggy shirts and brown over garments in 1980's films running through labyrinths ? ( i.e. : Labyrinth vs . Hellraiser 1 and 2 ) 
Zombie boyfriends love you for your brains ! Finally someone who isn't superficial XD 
In 12 hours I will know my fate as to whether I'll be going to nightfall as a guest or an employee ... :: crosses fingers for the former :: 
Nightfall was pretty amazing last night . First time in four years that I've been able to go as a guest and I < PROPMALE > out with friends after . Hope everyone had an amazing Halloween ! :D

The past couple of days there was a bizzar energy in the air ... On Monday I knew 5 or more people who decided to ditch school/work for whatever reason , but the day was nice overall . On Tuesday I was worried for a quiz I hadn't really studied for and when I got into class we all discovered that the quiz was canceled , we all got 100's , and instead of the quizes we got halloween < PROPFEMALE > ? O.o ... So fricken weird ! XD <3 
Off to the state Fair :D

Voltaire is going to be playing at the Wild West Con ? O.O Want VIP ticket bad ! D: :: tries to convince parents of b-day gift ... ( while they're awake of course ): : 
Things I learned today : Never leave your purse as a place holder in a theater ... Some crazy wacko will pick it up and ransack through it to find you have no cash ... \ 
Also Second life is The Sims on steroids ... gives me the heebeegeebees 
So I listened to a horoscope on Tarot.com and it made me giggle . Everything was reading pretty interestingly and it said I'll have the ability to be introspective today . But then it went to say \Don't be afraid to look under the bed\ " \ 
First day at Class was pretty awesome ! ~ Now into the world of Metal melting and what not to make really pretty jewelry :D

MUWAHAHAHAHA I am kidnapping ze crawfords for renfaire tomorrow . Yes , I know he already went and now looks like a raccoon , but this shall not thwart my diabolical plans >:DDD <3 
I'm now considering never reading fan fiction again after what happened this morning ... I came across this really great story and unfortunately the individual who posted it was not the original author nor did they have permission to re-post the story . As you could have guessed ... it was plagiarized . I began reading it and fell in love with the writing style and plot line . Kudos to the original and true author . 
WHOOO ! Gettin stuff done and taking names ! 
:: goes to crash :: Night night :D <3 
Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it , and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your Support . I copied and pasted it , will you ? 
To bed I go ... Night world :3

The One u just called fat ? She has been starving herself & she has lost over 30lbs . The One u just called stupid ? She has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The One you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The One you just tripped ? She is abused enough at home . Theres alot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if your against bullying 
Running around like a chicken with it's head cut off to get things going . Brother is driving into town tonight from Colorado . His friend < PROPFIRST > , him , and I are set to drive tomorrow to California to go to six Flags Magic Mountain . All to get home in time for me to go to class Monday Night @_@ .... dear god let things go smoothly ... 
So after all that stress last night and this morning I still don't get to go to Six flags XD . It's not meant to be that my brother and I go to the park together . Perhaps that's a sign that he'll make it back from Afghanistan and we can go again later in life . But anyways . New plan . < PROPMALE > horror tonight and then Ren faire tomorrow . :3
