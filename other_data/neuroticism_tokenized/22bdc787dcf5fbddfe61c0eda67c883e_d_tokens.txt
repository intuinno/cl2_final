Enjoying serving as the lighting operator during mega-church praise & worship services . Outside by the sounds of the fountain in the dark since very early this morning , before < PROPFEMALE > , working by the light of the laptop screen . Then catching the first few hints of light suggesting there may be a new day coming . First rays of sun hitting the tops of the clouds . Ah , sunrise .
