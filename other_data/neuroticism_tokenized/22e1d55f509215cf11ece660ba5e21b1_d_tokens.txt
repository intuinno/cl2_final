Facebook needs to be more drinker friendly . 

And the lord said \Go soxs ! \"" 
Just got home from the Flogging < PROPFEMALE > show . I have never been to a show as intense as this . The entire place was a 1000 person mosh pit . after about a half dozen car bombs and another gallon of Guinness I was rolling . I am completely soaked through with sweat , bruised and bleeding - freeking awesome . And I still have the Dropkick Murphy's show to look forward to tomorrow . It's like a Celtic wet dream come true . 
You have not lived until you have been knocked out moshing to \A call to arms\ " played on the bags . South Boston love yo !!!! " 
It's only taken three years but I've finally gotten around to posting some pictuers . 
Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes . Unfortunately aside from waiting in line for several hours to get my Birth Month Recal Physical and sweating my ass off for 2 hours durring General Quarters it was pretty uneventful . We have arrived in the Middle East and it is hotter than hell ! The good news though is that it is only going to get worse ...... sigh . 
Welcome to Dubai . The current temperature is 112 degrees ?!?! No wonder these people are so pissed off . If I had to spend my entire life in this < PROPFIRST > hell hole I would want to strap a bomb to my chest and run towards the nearest living thing too . Just once I'd like us to start a war in the Caribbean ! 
Trippin ' bawls ..... Lets steal a kid and go to < PROPMALE > E Cheese ! 
Every day is exactly the same . Help me I am in HELLLLLLL !!!!!!!!!!! 
Accomplishments in Bahrain :\ 
-Extinguished \raging\ " cigarette can fire\ 
Edit- Four\ 
monsters and 2 pseudo*********(sugar pills ) equals AWESOME !! I think I'm just going\ 
to sit here and watch the winamp visualization for about the next seven\ 
hours or so . -Edit\ 
\ 
P.S. thanks < PROPMALE > , that would explain why when I went to medical and asked for decongestants they gave me god damn Cepacol cough drops . Anyone who says that free medical is a benefit is a moron . 
I just ate some brownies and now time is going really really really really slow . I think I'm dead . 
THINGS THAT ARE DOWNRIGHT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN DRUNK : \ 
1 . No thanks , I'm married . \ 
2 . Nope , no more booze for me ! \ 
3 . Sorry , but you're not really my type . \ 
4 . No thanks , I'm not hungry . \ 
5 . I'm not interested in fighting you . \ 
6 . Thank you , but I won't make any attempt to dance . I have no coordination and I'd hate to look like a fool ! \ 
7 . I must be going home now as I have to work in the morning . 
Korn , Disturbed , Sevendust and As I lay Dying live tonight and no one else wants to go . What is wrong with people !? Well to hell with all of you , I'm going . 
Concert pt 1 :\ 
Awesome show ! Korn was balls out as was to be expected , Disturbed definitely stole the show , Sevendust put on a great set , and In This Moment was a surprise breakout hit . If you are into metal or hard rock I Highly recommend checking them out . Something about a hot blond with a great body that can belt out a sternum rattling guttural chorus followed by an earsplitting soprano solo . I think I'm in love . 
Home alone with no adult supervision . Got the whole place to myself- what to do ? House party on the mezz !!! This is going to be the best det . ever !!!! 
Soooo bored . With nothing better to do with my final days out to sea I'm becoming dangerously introspective . This will not end well . 
Welcome to the Key West Area Of Operations \ 
It is Feb 8th , 12:00 AM\ 
The current outside temperature is 76 degrees Fahrenheit with 78% relative humidity . \ 
Sometimes- just sometimes . I really love this job . 
Why does every crappy job in the world look so damn cool on tv ? I know that working on the flight deck sucks ass , but stick a camera crew up there for a few hours and all of a sudden these window lickers look so bad ass even I want to go pump fuel . I call this the \Top Gun Factor \"." 
I love global warming . 
The weekend count so far : Car Bombs- 5 , Pints of Guinness- 11 , Hours moshing @ Flogging < PROPFEMALE > show- 4.5 , days still < PROPMALE > over- 2 , Amount of bodily pain- a lot . Totally worth it . 
To all Trumanites : The bar is now open ! Room 905 . All drinks on the house . And for all of you last minute shoppers , I have an extra ticket to the party to give away . 
I am so bored and I have nothing to do . I need to find a way to make my dinner last at least 5 hours . 
So I come back home from dinner and stuff- decided on sushi by the way , killed over five hours- and in my email inbox are 9 updates from Facebook . This is the most popular I've ever been in my entire life . 
Mardi Gras !! Well , seems for another year in a row , with out even planing , I over did it . Damn kids . Waking up for work in 5 hours should be interesting . I love being Catholic when it's convenient . And damn you Dreg you gimp Mofo . No more Fireman carrying your broken ass home .
