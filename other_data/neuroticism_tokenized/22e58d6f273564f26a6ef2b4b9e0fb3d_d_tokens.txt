The highlight of the day : My 80-year-old grandmother beating my brother in the family poker game and then proceeding to wave the winnings in his face . XD 

loves talking to anthropologists and historians who are actually interested in his honors thesis :D 
just realized that what makes a dork is not how much one studies , but how early one wakes up on a weekend to hear academics speak . . . need . . . coffee . . . * dead * 
Hello morning , I hate you . 
' s thoughts are permeated by \Engine Driver\ " by the Decemberists " 
is drinking shiso-flavored Pepsi . Weird , but somehow refreshing . 
misses you more than you know ... 
should buy stock in Family Mart because basically they own his soul with their damn fried chicken/culinary orgasm . 
wishes he were strong enough to just throw all his damn crap over the Pacific to Hawaii . Guess I need to go to the gym more .

|Grand aunty : I feel like I should give you some advice before you go back to Harvard ... Well I just got dentures so I can't whistle now . All that happens when I try is pfffft . So whistle as much as you can while you're young < PROPMALE > ! Okay hand me those chocolates now ... | < PROPMALE > : But what about your diabetes ! | Grand aunty : I just said I have no teeth and can't whistle ! Go back to your books and give me the chocolate . | :) 
cannot decide what the best part of his job is - the free desk space to study on , the pay , the co-workers , or the possibility of a publication ? Actually , it might be the future picnics with the kiddies learning about biotech . XD 
finished another scholarship app and found a bar of peppermint bark . Nice . 
is going to the civil unions rally tomorrow at the capitol ! BE THERE ! 
twisted his ankle , but has much to be happy about . 
has somehow obtained a gravitational pull for unsolicited snarkiness as of late . 
Lecture by < PROPFEMALE > Haraway this Sunday at 3pm at Revolution Books ! < PROPFEMALE > la revolucion ! 
just heard from MIT that he has advanced to the second stage of admissions ! Now I just have to pass the interview ... in front of all the profs ... across the country in Massachusetts ... * ulcer * 
DUKE FINALIST XD ... just got to pass their interview as well ... * double ulcer * 
believes people who work at coffee shops and do not know what a double shot espresso is ( and therefore have to ask me ?! ) , should be dragged on the street , publicly defamed , and shot as a heathen to all that is holy and caffeinated . 
Interview . With Yale . My first choice school . There is no emoticon for this . 
???????????????????????????????????? 
Pizza + best friend + smashing the hell out of each other in a video game = happiness . 
Sometimes I wish I had a bazooka with which to blow up UH . Just saying . ??????????????????

has been accepted by Harvard \\(^^ )\\\\\\\\\\ /////( ^^)/ 
wants to divorce his arsehole boyfriend named \Sleep . \ " He keeps trying to get me into bed and not do this mountain of homework . ARGH . " 
... so is there going to be an island to return to ? 
would just like to point out that during his time away from Hawaii , a tsunami almost hit the islands , and subsided as he came back . Possible platform for being the next messiah ? 
is going to be boned by human osteology this Friday . And possibly struck by lightning for that horrible pun . 
seriously needs to get his body fixed - how dare it cry for more than four hours of sleep when there is homework to be done ! 
would just like to thank all manner of deities for the existence of slash . That is all . With love , from homo . 
passed his honors thesis defense with a recommendation for highest honors ! ... And yet the semester is not over . What the ... 
Derrida you blow my mind . And my binaries . 
Harvard it is . 
Reason #2451 why I should not have to take physical anthropology : < PROPFEMALE > primate skulls ( specifically of the bushbaby variety ) , like delicate pieces of < PROPMALE > and plant life of all kinds , await their destruction in my care . These hands were made to record , not preserve . Therein lies all the difference . 
In the best of all possible worlds , there would be a direct IV drip of caffeine into my bloodstream right about now . 
loves how money falls from the sky of academia :) 
House passes HB 444 XD 
has been to places where there are no Asians before ( e.g. Montana ) , but for some reason it is more disturbing in New Mexico when you factor in pick-up trucks , cowboy hats , staring children , and a desert . 
I do not know which is more horrifying : being the only undergraduate in an airport shuttle at 4:30 am ( to add sleep-deprived brainlessness with general brainlessness ) with established anthro professors , or hearing them discuss their colleagues in their 40s who have had aneurysms and strokes due to stress . In either case , a stress-induced attack is imminent . 
feels a bit horrible for asking , but who is graduating this semester ? I NEED NAMES TO BUY YOU LEIS XD 
got the job to transcribe interviews for a visiting anthropology professor from Japan . Squee XD 
did not fail this semester ! Huzzah ! ( Okay I got a 4.0 . Yes I overreacted . What of it ! I am an academic drama < PROPFEMALE >.) 
Thank you for all the birthday wishes ! :) 
is in Bloomington , Indiana :/ The lady at the coffee shop said she never made an iced latte before .... And suddenly , the downside to supporting local businesses is revealed . Starbucks , save me . 
went from Corn Land ( aka Indiana ) to Mormon Land ( aka Utah ) and has finally arrived in San < PROPFEMALE > . Civilization . Finally . ( Thanks Seojon < PROPFIRST > for keeping me company in the corn fields XD ) . 
got attacked by a damn squirrel . I hate nature . 
has an apple in his eye by the name of < PROPFIRST > Flett . 
If you are a gay guy and in love with Hello < PROPFEMALE > , please contact me ! 
watched < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland with < PROPFIRST > Flett ! The Fanning sisters make mental illnesses look beautiful . 
Much frustration and seven hours later : http://nealakatsuka.com/About%20Me.html . It isn't going to win any prizes for creativity , but it is up . Finally . 
4 months <3 
hates the Blank Screen of Death T_T 
leaves for Harvard on Tuesday ... 
is in Boston . 
thought he was a zombie at 7 AM on Sunday morning as family friends drove him to an outlet mall in Maine , but realized the real monsters are the people that did not drink coffee to become human . Ugh , morning people . 
is a proud owner of an iPad 
hates rain . I don't care if there has been a drought in the area . My hair took 45 minutes ! Get your priorities straight Mother Nature .

may fail out of Harvard . And then life . And then a black hole will open up and destroy the world . Hello Armageddon . 
lost his brain somewhere on the way to class ... Can someone point me to the yellow brick road ? 
on the run to a lecture with ( c)old pizza in my mouth and deadlines on my mind . Life as a grad student . :) 
thinks today was pretty damn epic :) 
|| After all this time , Levi-Strauss ' structuralist anthropology FINALLY makes sense ( well , to the extent that it can be made sense of ) - thank you < PROPMALE > Leach for your succinct and snarky introduction . 
would like to request for someone to fix the sun . It is so COLD . Global warming is a LIE . 
|| Damn . Condiment sandwich it is . 
had his first \American\ " ( i.e. non-Japanese influenced ) Thanksgiving tonight ! " 
may be burned for these final papers . In the state that held witchcraft trials . Somehow that makes it all better .

| Lady Gaga concert tickets for boyfriend - purchased . I am awesome :) 
| Neal : I placed into third year Japanese ... but I've taken it since high school ! Augh ! I shouldn't have taken a year off from using it . | Mom : It's ok I took nine years of Mandarin and only remember three phrases . You don't use it , you lose it . | Neal : Or , it's actually genetics and no fault of my own ! | Mom : Good thing Harvard already accepted you ... 
just wrote one of the best precis EVER ! It may have been 4-pages single-spaced , but the original book was 400 pages SO WHATEVER . Ugh , but why did it have to be < PROPFEMALE > Kaufman's \ ... And a Time to Die\ " that got seared into my brain ? Oh the ambivalence . " 
| I feel like a < PROPFEMALE > shrimping boat being sucked into the maelstrom of faculty politics . -_- 
has so many deadlines and only one can of Red Bull . Uh oh ... 
| ... There are mice scurrying around in the walls ... 
will be the discussant for < PROPFIRST > Fortun at the social anthropology seminar in April ! :D Maybe I should ask her to sign her book for me ...

would like to know how Japanese people can wear long sleeves plus layers and not sweat in this heat . Seriously . Is there some kind of spray I do not know about ? Can I buy it at Family Mart ? 
| Host Mom : Do you know this brand ? Diizeru ... | Me : Diesel ? Yes I do ! | Host Mom : Let's go to the outlet stores this Sunday then ! | Me : YAY ! | Is it wrong that this excites me more than the offers to go to another < PROPFEMALE > or shrine ...? :D 
bought a genetically modified blue < PROPFEMALE > today ! And then interviewed the head researcher at Suntory who created it ! :D 
will be a senior tutor for the 2011-2012 academic year ! Someone's senior thesis is in my hands ... oh the pow- ... I mean , the responsibility :) 
thinks staring into the creepy < PROPFEMALE > eyeballs of the 1001 statues of Kannon with their crazy spider arms at Sanjuusangen-dou rivals any horror flick about porcelain dolls . Who knew Enlightenment could be so scary ... 
wants to see X-Men ! 
: Sensei , I need to go to the gym and diet because I gained weight . | Fukai Sensei : I think I know why . | Me : Huh ? | Fukai Sensei : Your scale at home is broken . And your host family's scale is broken too . And you are delusional from the summer heat . | :D LOL

forgot how reading Foucault makes him feel illiterate . 
ate halfway through a frozen chicken sandwich before reading the heating instructions on the package ... Guess I should not have assumed vending machine food is always extremely cold , hard , and tasteless . 
loves his bf and especially the warm spot he leaves on the bed when he gets up for work at 4am . It's like he's still here for a bit longer ~ 
: Petition for exemption from department language requirements , GRANTED ! Hawaiian Pidgin and molecular bio techniques = a language ( sort of) ! What series of unintended consequences and unfortunate events have I triggered ? :D
