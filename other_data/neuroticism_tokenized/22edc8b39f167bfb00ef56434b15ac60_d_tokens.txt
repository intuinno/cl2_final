I'm addicted to < PROPFEMALE > ! 
What people do , just because they can ... 
Excuse me while I go be a nerd and catch up on my science ... 
Bad thing about online banking ... It requires frequent updates ! > < 
Dance the night away and live your life ~ 
So excited that Fever < PROPFIRST > has a new song !! <3

Nobody can go back and start a new beginning , but anyone can start today and make a new ending . 
I really want to see Repo : the Genetic Opera again !

“Gays aren’t risking dying because they’re dying to do makeovers and make-outs in the barracks . They’re going to adapt and fit in . They’re good at that because they’ve had to be . ” 
Alrighty < PROPFIRST > , YOU can do this , make yourself goals and DAMNIT stick with them , no more giving up , no more holding back ; It's time to make a name for yourself no matter how HARD it gets , you got this ! 
The night bus driver , was like the < PROPFEMALE > on top for today . Who knew two strangers would love to be crazy in one breif moment and sing out loud ! It was an awesome ride home ! =-D 
Today is about my best friend , the shoulder I can always cry on , the one person that will take my secrets to the grave , the one person I can always come to without feelings judged ; the one woman who helped me become a man . I love you Mum ! 
Off to go be productive ! ~ 
I need to start going to bed earlier !.. starting to look like a zombified coon . 
Not feeling so sociable today .

Well today should be ... interesting 
I feel like I should write a book about my life .. so many struggles , so many people I met on my journey , so many things I would like the world to know .. to let them know they are not alone , to let them know that one person can push through no matter what the circumstances are . 
Off to go see Cpt . < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 
Lately I have been having odd dreams . 
This is sad , you know you have no life when you have to come here for entertainment , so lame . 
I've come to the conclusion , I have very little in common with a lot of people ... 
Salary of the US President .................. $ 400,000 \ 
Salary of retired US Presidents ............. $ 180,000 \ 
Salary of House/Senate ....................... $ 174,000 \ 
Salary of Speaker of the House ............ $ 223,500 \ 
Salary of Majority/Minority Leaders ...... 193,400 \ 
... Average Salary of Soldier DEPLOYED IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN $ 21,000 \ 
I think we found where the cuts should be made ! If you agree ... RE-POST 
I find it hard to argue with people because I alway see where they come from .. I would make a horrible politician ... haha 
I'm sorry , but < PROPFEMALE > Spears new song is .. soo .. catchy ! > < Stupid simplicity ! 
SO , on my way to the mailbox this morning , there stood a beautiful female pitbull . Long story short I tried to find her owner by walking around .. but no one hollard .. I took her back ( outside the APT ) to give her some water and to call the OHS .. but she ran away AGAIN ! > < .. now i feel so guitly .. i tried to help a lost dog and failed . 
Slept all day and morning ... 
I wish I'd have some good luck for once .

Hummingbird --> symbolizes timless joy and the Nectar of Life . It's a symbol for accomplishing that which seems impossible and will teach you how to find the miracle of joyful living from your own life circumstances .

Wellll , who knows , because I don't . 
I think in an hour , Ima go be a pool rat .. and maybe sun bathe ^__^ 
So , I want to see this independent film called ' Weekend ' ... I started to tear just watching the trailer ! 
Giving up doesn't always mean you are weak . Sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go . 
I'm glad everyone is getting their happy endings . 
Woke up with a massive headache .. fml . 
My brain feels like its turning to moosh after all pounding in my skull ... yea not feeling so hot . 
I think I am just done with people ... and nothing is going to change my mind . 
My fingers hurt from trying to tune this stupid guitar >> 
And here I was ready for the gym this morning , only to find out it doesn't open until noon .. oi . 
Tu es tout et tout est tien ~ 
MEh . 
Nostalgia is hitting hard . 
Pep talkin ' myself isn't working ... it's just bringing me down more ... One thing I need to learn : Stop being so hard on myself .

It's a Team Fortress 2 night . Oh yea , people are going to be hatin ' the Spy ! xD 
Well I try to relax .. and my neighbors above are throughing a party .. LOUD as ever and they were messing around .. and knocked several glasses off their edge ... broken glass on the ground and the blachony smells like alcohol and orange juice . RAGE 
Hmm ... * gears grinding * 
There is only one thing I ask of you ; be true to yourself no matter the circumstances , to be bold and never give up on yourself , ever . That's all I want for my birthday . <3 
I had a great day with Pickle ! <3 
Alrighty , time to get lost in my nerdy world . ^^ 
Man .. IDK how I got on the streams of youtube on kids getting bullied .. It really upsets me , only because I know what they went through ... This world needs to change . It makes me pissed off to hear people would rather take their own lives than to survive and overcome those scum-bags . 
Here's to being 22 . 
You know how you get a memory that came out of know where and you wish you did something about it and it just brought you to tears b/c you actually regret NOT doing anything about it .. yea .. I'm having that moment . 
Thank you all , means a lot ! ;D \ 
Love you all ! <3 
It's about time the 90 degree weather went away ! Whooo-HOOO ! Time for flippy-flops and shorts in this nice wet gloomy weather ! yes ! <3

I got 20 pages of crap to fill out ... and looong list of my past to go through ! Thank God I have till 9 AM Wed .! ( I fill like I'm back in school ... OI !! ) 
It's going to be a great day . =) 
I\m kind of nervous for my ASVAB test ... I hope I can qualify for something that would hold my general intrest . " 
Meh . 
I went for a roughly 4 mile run yesterday and I don't feel sore from it ! I must run longer ! OI -_- 
* sigh * .. can I snap my fingers and get what I want ? Pleeeasseee ? 
I'm NOT feeling very friendly right now . 
I suppose it's time to go running again . 
It's so weird to see people after six years and to see such a dramatic change . 
So , what are your thoughts on ' Gay Marriage' ? 
Let's see if all this running paid off for PT tomorrow .
