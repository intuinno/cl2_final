To lighten the mood , let's hear a joke that is devoid of anything racist , stereotypical or hate-mongering : What is the difference between a mexican and an asian ? Mexicans have a mexican ethnic background and grew up with Mexican culture , while asians have asian ancestry and grew up with asian culture .

Maybe I should start living a life of lies . My whole life I have strived to never stray from honesty . But it is redundant , as my word is as believed as the liars . Through their smoke screen , they seek to corrupt the truth for their own personal benefits , and incriminate the opposer . Can we see through it ? No , as much more work goes into a lie , making it seem more believable . Thus , the act of truth-telling is useless . 
A general distrust of human society is what causes the lies in the first place . Honest people's words rust in the background as the lies stand prominent , taking in all attention , consuming and destroying until that is all people know . Acception of something different is a large step in this society , and people who make that step are ridiculed and tread on .

Come November 2nd , hopefully < PROPFEMALE > still has some sense and doesn't vote ignorant obstructionist conservatives to the majority in Congress . 
A dark mist closing in , taking away , until all hope is gone . The severity of helplessness is unknown to the ones on the other side , ignorant to the horrors and flattening of emotion that desecrates the brightest of souls . Inside the mist , lies swarm like locust , greed slithers like a striking snake , and honesty is spat upon . To succumb to it's wrath until you are but a sillohuette in the vastness is the only option . 
Instead of distancing themselves from Obama , Democrats should be shedding light on his presidency .

40 , what a number . \ 
About 40% of Americans believe in Creationism . \ 
About 40% of Americans are also conservative . 
The Republicans have no idea what they're doing ... or maybe they do . What they plan on doing is changing pay-as-you-go rules so that tax cuts do not need spending offsets but spending increases do , and they can't be paid for with closing tax loopholes for large corporations . Who are they to be chastising about increasing the deficit when their plan both destroys the economy and increases deficit ? 
Health Care Reform Will :\ 
Reduce the deficit by 230 billion dollars over 10 years . \

In 30 states it is legal to fire someone for being gay . In over 25 states gay marriage is illegal , and in many it is illegal for same-sex couples to adopt . MLK fought for civil rights with a passion . He would be outraged at the current civil rights battle going on now . How is such a backwards concept so prevalant in our progressive society ? Homophobes are no better than racists , disgusting .
