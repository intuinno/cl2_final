I actually can't even handle ppl today ... work needs to end now 
wants a chick flick , a blunt , and a good beer 
work the rest of the night :-( 
Yes urban dictionary : < PROPFEMALE > - An extremely attractive girl whos flirty personality and curvacious figure will keep you coming back for more . She's typically a brunette but occasionally acts blonde . She enjoys long relationships and has many close guy friends . Often mistaken for a \slut\ " but really isn't . She can also be a super bitch if you get onto her bad side . extremely true in my opinion :-) " 
bed . work in the morning :( 
Why is < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s open today ?? I don't even think there are ppl in this city that are THAT stupid to want a fucking cold sub on a day like today ... 
at work until 10 .... b/c clearly i'm the General Manager .... 
2 more hours :-D 
Green , wine , chocolate ice cream with peanut butter sauce , and a movie .... knowing that i can have all this in an hour makes it all worth it

missin ' the Heights </3 
dinner for grandma's 90th birthday , then getting drunk later :-) 
I can go with the flow ... I can say it doesn't matter anymore ... I can go with the flow 
is trying not to make an inrrational decision , I'm trying to tell myself to sleep on it ... but I just don't know if I want to feel this anymore 
bang bang , that awful sound 
if I have to wait until the end of time , darling , that will be just fine as long as I can call you mine 
working until close , then right back up for work at noon ... awesome :-( 
I have to be at work in about 5 hours and 20 minutes , and i can't fall asleep ... uncool :-( 
it seems like the ppl I care about the most know how to hurt me the worst :'( 
why was yesterday so wonderful and today so completely awful ? 
Well , one worthless friend gone ... any others care to join ? 
I can't seem to stop the sinking feeling in my chest from all the disappointing things that keep happening :-S 
On the phone long , long distance , always through such strong resistance , and first you say your to busy , I wonder if you even miss me . 
If he ain't gonna love you the way he should then let it go , if he ain't gonna treat you the way he should then let it go 
</3 ow :'( 
It might not be the right time , I might not be the right one , but there's something about us I want to say , cause there's something between us anyway 
Spending the day/night with one of my lovely bffs < PROPFEMALE > Weaver !! Yay ! <3 
I know that I am your dangerous side effect 
The worst thing to realize is , in the end , it was all for nothing 
I know you thought your life was goin be easy when you didn't call you found that you were wrong . I know you thought your life was goin be easy you thought you had it all but you found that you were wrong 
See maybe there was something wrong , and you weren't telling me no ... See maybe the laugh's on me , and life was telling me a joke 
First midterm of the day over with :-) . Mall with Katieface , midterm numba 2 , then out to the bars :-D 
OH MY GOD !! Cali OFFICIALLY in two weeks !!!!!!! Yesssssssssss !!!!!!!!! Work at ten , maybe earlier to gush over plans with < PROPMALE > !!! 
But do you want to come on , scooch on over closer dear , and I will nibble your ear <3 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you . Laughing like childeren , living like lovers , rolling like thunder under the covers and I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Kegs and eggs before class and work is probably a bad idea . Am I doing it anyway ? Yes :-) (*(*(*( L.A. and Vegas in 11 days !!! )*)*)*) 
shift from hell .... midnight come sooner so i can go back to drinking 
On to the next one 
at work for 2 more hours then going out to celebrate the 21st birthday of the lovely Tiffini Tindari Conley :-) <3 
ok so the rodent in the walls is officially freaking me out .... eeewwww :-( 
not sleeping and then working 11ish hours is not an awesome idea ... i'll probably be passed out in a booth before the end of this shift ... but what a good night :-) 
I want your love , I don't wanna be friends 
The plane tickets are waiting for us , the hotel in vegas is booked , and I'm almost done packing ... one test and 4 1/2 shifts of work left until < PROPMALE > and I are in < PROPFEMALE > California for 9 days !!!

Work til 10 , then more packing ... beyond excited to leave the day after tomorrow :-D 
It's officially one day until < PROPFEMALE > Rogers and I leave for L.A. !!! :-D 
Sleep , work , L.A. !!!!! I can't believe today has finally arrived :-D

Home , and not at all excited about it ... :-P 
working tonight ... I wish I was still in L.A. :-( 
I wish certain organizations would stop asking < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s for free fucking food all the fucking time , you can't fucking have any !! 
I want your love and all your lovers ' revenge , you and me could write a bad romance ;-) 
what a great day for my prof to cancel class :-) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > sandwiches are waaay better toasted ... I think Mr. Liautaud needs to get hip 
Dinner with the fam for my mom's big 5-0 then back to work for the night 
I miss the heights , but I'm not so sure the heights misses me so much anymore ... sad reality 
Happy Holiday !!! :-D 
One test down , one to go . Cavs game with the wifey , then to the outpost to see < PROPFEMALE>'s band !!! < {[(**missing you <3 **)]} > 
Work allllll day 
at work until 6 , then working on a paper ... sweet :-P 
I really don't want to write this paper ... school is such a waste of time ... I could have been done with everything early had I not taken a usless minor , or I could have been done in May had I not put off italian ... it's ok , just four more classes left and I'm done ... but fuck this paper . Cavs game later , maybe ? 
I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes , and we both still got room left to grow . And though love sometimes hurts , I still put you first and we'll make this thing work , but I think we should take it slow 
passing out JJ's samples at flashfest , hopefully all the losers that go to flashfest for fun won't be hungry hippos this year like every other year 
He wore black and I wore white , he would always win the fight ... Bang bang , he shot me down . Bang bang , I hit thie ground . Bang bang , that awful sound . Bang bang , my baby shot me down . 
Work til 4 ... ish ... :-P 
when I don't get coffee I hate everyone 
Cavs game !! :-D 
computer virus = boredom 
I'm bored at work and I'll be even more bored at home with no internet to keep me entertained ... hopefully I'll have my laptop back tomorrow * fingers crossed * 
YAY !!! Fixed computer !!!! :-D 
studying for a 7:45 am exam .... why does that even exist ?? 
just two extra credit papers and then I'm done ... until summer classes start :-P 
:'( oh cavs , why ?? 
It might not be the right time , I might not be the right one , But there's something about us I want to say , cause there's something between us anyway 
Going to NY for the day with my girls for some much needed realxation :-) 
I have to say this weekend was probably the best start to summer I've had in a long time ... Mer and < PROPMALE > on Saturday ... Carly and < PROPFEMALE > in NY on Sunday ... and it carries over to today because I get to see < PROPFIRST > Golphin tonight after work <3 <3 <3 
Just booked my flight for LA <3 
SAMOOOOODDDIIIIEEEEEEE !!!!!!

Some people disgust me beyond belief .... 
Late night nature walk with Jessface :-) 
Don't cha ? 
why am I wide awake after only about 4 hours of sleep ?? uncool :-( 
Sigh no more , ladies , sigh no more , Men were deceivers ever , One foot in sea , and one on shore , To one thing constant never . Then sigh not so , but let them go , And be you blithe and < PROPFEMALE > , Converting all your sounds of woe Into hey nonny nonny . 
Going to the Heights to see my little brother graduate !!! Congratulations to < PROPFIRST > Taliaferro and the < PROPMALE > Heights High class of 2010 !! :-D

I have never puked on myself , or in the public eye , but some drunk bitch decided she should ... I would like to kill her . Now . 
Even though it's a bit early , I would like my graduation present to be me and a group of friends going to Burning Man . Yes . :-) 
Kiss me , it'll heal but it won't forget 
Going out tonight for mah birfday !! :-D 
Thankyou to everyone for the birthday love :-D 
I know the truth now , I know who you are and I don't love you anymore . It never was and never will be , you don't know how you've betrayed me , and somehow you've got everybody fooled 
How is it that I don't work at < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s anymore , and yet all of my problems these days are caused by the people that work there ??? These people need to grow up and stay the fuck out of my life . 
No class !! * sigh of relief * :-) 
Watching the snow fall outside my window , I have decided that today is great day to start getting pumped for The Heron 2011 ! :-D
