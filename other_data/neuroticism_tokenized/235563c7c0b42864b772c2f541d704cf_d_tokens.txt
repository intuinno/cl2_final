Today is worldwide cancer awareness day .

I sent Kohl's gift card invites ...... you can only register for the card if you send all your friends invites and then they take you through a maze of offers of which you must accept 2 before your registration is complete !!!!!! I'm sorry !!!!.. Is tut mer leid !!!.... < PROPMALE>' go there 
This message comes in several parts ....!!!! Part 1 This teacher is truly a genius ! An economics professor at a local college made a statement that he had never failed a single student before , but had once failed an entire class . That class had insisted that Obama's socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be < PROPMALE > , a great equalizer . 
Part 3 - As the second test rolled around , the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little . The second test average was a D ! No one was happy . 
Part 4 - When the 3rd test rolled around , the average was an F . The scores never increased as bickering , blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else . 
Part 5 - All failed , to their great surprise , and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great , the effort to succeed is great but when government takes all the reward away , no one will try or want to succeed . Could not be any simpler than that . 
My mind is lacrimose . Working on a new contract for billing through a PLLC . Do I really need to be a PLLC to continue with them ? Do I really want to take 5% less ? But they have been sooooo supportive in the past . Do I really want to take on marketing myself to other docs ? Woe is me .... * sigh * 
In loving memory of every cancer patient , family and friends who have lost the battle of cancer and the ones who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > if you know someone who has or had cancer . Unfortunately , almost everyone has been exposed to someone with cancer ......

It's such a shame that one can have such an impact on others by way of their negative thoughts , words & actions . It's mostly because we thought this person was a little more humane than he's turned out to be ..... and that is what brings up the sad feelings ... we misjudged him & allowed him into our lives . Couldn't have believed he was this ....... sad . * heavy sigh *
