had a great birthday . Family came to visit . Brought ice cream cake and presents . 
has been working in the flower gardens today . It's a never ending job , sort like housework . 
Ouch , I have a sore throat . It's not fair to be sick when on vacation . 
I feel awful . My sore throat has turned into a miserable cold . Ugh . 
still waiting for the virus to run its course so I can feel good again . 
School is back in session today , but I have to stay home . Going to the doctor .

Getting ready for a big family dinner . 
Back to work again this week , busy times , tired evenings . 
Second quiet day at home ( school is having another snow day ) , so calming . 
I love snow !!!! 
Another day at home . I'm ready to get back to work . These days off with barely any snow are strange to say the least . I've been able to get some housework done , left over from the holidays , and read a couple of books though . 
I'm going to have another wonderful grandson . < PROPFIRST > and Britanie are having a boy . 
Just got up from a Sunday afternoon nap . 
My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease ; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE ........ 93% of people won't copy and paste this , WILL YOU be one of 
Up early , getting ready for church . 
I fell this week and have a fracture in my bone up near my shoulder . It has been painful . 
Its been a nice peaceful Saturday and the missionaries came for dinner . 
Granddaughters are wonderful , and of course grandsons are , too . One of my granddaughters just got engaged and another is coming to spend the weekend with us . Happy . happy . happy ! 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day to all my friends and loved ones . May your lives be long and happy ! 
My granddaughter , < PROPFEMALE > , got to our house safely . Yea !!! 
Had a good visit with < PROPFEMALE > this weekend . 
indexed 50 names on Sunday . 
To all my Kokomo friends and family : It was great seeing you this past weekend . We sure do miss you since we moved to Ky . Hopefully , we will get to come back sometime this summer and visit longer . 
Our 18th grandchild was born yesterday , June 21 . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > was 8 pounds and 15 ounces . He has dark brown hair , lots of it and naturally , I think he is beautiful . Mom , Britanie and Dad , < PROPFIRST > are doing well . 
Britanie had to have an emergency c-section because < PROPFIRST>'s head was turned wrong and he got stuck in the birth canal . We are so thankful for modern medicine and that Britanie and < PROPFIRST > are fine . 
I'm visiting my daughter , < PROPFEMALE > , in Oklahoma . It is always suprising to see how much the grandchildren have grown . < PROPFEMALE>'s eldest is a couple of inches taller than me and her oldest son lacks 1 inch being as tall as me , not that I'm so tall . 
There\ 
comes a time in life when you walk away from all the pointless drama\ 
and people who create it , and surround yourself with people who make\ 
you laughso hard that you forget the bad and focus on the good . Life is\ 
too short to be anything but happy ...... Repost if you agree , I just\ 
did . 
To set the record straight , I have 18 wonderful grandchildren . I have no favorites . I love them all . 
We just had an awesome family reunion with our kids and grandchildren . My sweet daughter-in-law , Britanie , took lots of pictures which will be posted soon . 
Baby < PROPFIRST > has been here for over a month . He is so precious . 
Our reunions are over for the year , the Myers one the weekend of July 24 and the Wall reunion ( my mom's side of the family ) this past weekend . It is so fun to get together with family . 
My air conditioner in my house is broken . Woe is me , I hate the heat and can't wait until Monday so we can call the repairman . 
Got our air conditioner fixed . I'm so happy and it did not cost and arm and a leg to pay for it . 
I just spent most of the day watching Baby < PROPFIRST > and I get to see him again tomorrow . Being a grandma is the best . 
I'm sure all of my Kokomo friends are excited about the coming < PROPFEMALE > in Indy . I know I gave a shout of joy when I heard it . 
General conference was awesome . I love it when every 6 months conference comes . It is so good the get instructions from our leaders . 
Thanks to all my friends and family for all the birthday wishes . It's people like you that makes life worthwhile . I had a wonderful birthday which made up for getting older . 
A quiet and peaceful Saturday . I'm loving it . 
Fall allergies are bugging me . I'm itching all over . 
Good morning , facebook friends !!! I thank the Lord for giving me another day to live . Hallelujah ! 
For those of you who don't know , the sweet baby in my profile picture is < PROPFIRST > , our youngest grandchild . He is the son of our youngest son , < PROPFIRST > and wife , Britanie . 
Happy Halloween , everybody . When I was a child it was my favorite holiday next to Christmas . We always dressed up and went to a fall festival at school . We had costume contests and my mom was so good at making costumes that I often won .

Good morning everyone . It's a great day . I'm going to a morning exercise class . It's my first time going . I hope I like it . 
I knew I was out of shape , but I didn't know how badly . It was hard for me to do some of the easiest tasks in the exercise class this morning . I'm going back again tomorrow though . 
I've had several people ask where I'm taking the exercise class . So here you are : it is at the Better Living Center in Danville across from the Boyle County Fairgrounds . 
Just got back from my exercise class . Let me tell you , if I hadn't told everybody yesterday that I would go today , I would have stayed home . I'm sore but it was fun . 
I have an online business that I am just starting . It is annieskidswear.com Prices on brand name items are 50-75% off regular store pricesCheck it out and then e-mail me at annieskidswear@gmail.com for a $5 discount code .

We'll be missing < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , our dear friend , who passed away this afternoon . I'm so sad that she is gone , but I know she must be feeling better now . 
Just had an enjoyable visit with my Litster grandchildren , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s kids . \ 
They came yesterday afternoon and just left to go home . 
Just got back from my morning exercise class and miracle of miracles , < PROPFIRST > went also . 
Baby < PROPFIRST > is visiting . He is sleeping now so I can get a few things done . He is so sweet . Being a grandma is great . I'm thankful that the Lord has blessed me with many grandchildren . Each one is very special and I love them all so much . 
Just want to remind all our friends in the < PROPFEMALE > Branch that we are having our Thanksgiving Dinner at the church at 6:30 tonight . Anyone else who may be nearby are welcome as well . 
The Thanksgiving dinner was great . Lots of people came , food was good , and it was fun sharing the things we were thankful for at this time . 
I'm getting ready to go on a 3 mile walk . It's called the Turkey Trot that is held yearly in < PROPFIRST > County to raise money for Toys for Tots . 
Just got home from my 3 mile run , The Turkey Trot . Unfortunately , I came in next to last , but fortunately , I finished the race . 
Having a nice quiet afternoon after going to church . 
Just had a busy day with my four Litster grandchildren and Baby < PROPFIRST > . Getting ready for Thanksgiving at my house tomorrow . 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone !!!!!! 
I'm working on the Christmas program for church on Dec . 17 . We're are having our Christmas dinner then , too . All are welcome to come . 
We finally got our Christmas tree up . It is quite beautiful . < PROPFIRST > is coming tomorrow . He will like the lights . 
< PROPFIRST > is sick . He has a really bad cold . 
There is a dusting of snow on the ground . It is so pretty . 
I'm going to whine now . I have caught < PROPFIRST>'s cold and it is all in my head . My nose drips and my sinuses are killing me . They hurt even when I take pain meds . Know of any wonder drugs that will zap this thing ? I have too many things to do to be sick . 
Still fighting the cold , but am better . It is hard to get anything done when ever so often I find I need to lay down and rest . Oh well , it will be gone soon . 
Well , I did it again . Fell asleep in front of the TV , woke up after an hour or two , and now I can't go back to sleep . 
We are having our December Christmas potluck tonight at 6:30 at the < PROPFEMALE > branch . Come and see our Christmas program following the dinner . 
I just spent the day in the hospital while < PROPFIRST > had total hip replacement . Everything went well , but he is in a lot of pain right now . 
< PROPFIRST > is doing well . He had two sessions of physical therapy today . It was painful , but being the stubborn and strong man that he is he did everything that was asked of him . He even walked down the hall with his < PROPMALE > and then back . He has been amazingly pleasant in spite of his pain . 
My husband has made me laugh . Wiped my tears . Hugged me tight . Saved my life . Watched me succeed . Seen me fail . Cheered me on . Kept me going strong . Put up with my mood swings . Has said everything will be ok when things get tough . Keeps me sane . My husband is a promise from God that I will have a best friend forever . Put this as your status if you love your husband !! 
< PROPFIRST > came home from the hospital today . He is doing well as can be expected at this point . It is just going to take time and a lot of physical therapy , but he will be ready to garden come spring . 
< PROPFIRST > is walking with a smooth glide with his < PROPMALE > . His physical therapist was impressed . 
Winter is the best time to have surgery because we generally stay home more in the winter anyway . < PROPFIRST > is still improving . Yea !!!! 
Such a beautiful day ! I love it when the sun shines and we have an extra bonus . There is about 3 inches of snow on the ground . It sparkles like diamonds when the sun shines on it . 
Hey , < PROPFIRST > , how are you doing ? How's the job hunting going ? 
I've fallen in love with a new vegetable : Kale . Of course , it is not new , just my getting to know it is . 
Going under the knife today . Will have a complete hysterectomy . Please say a little prayer for me . 
Can home from the hospital on Monday evening . \ 
Am doing well . Thanks for any prayers you may have said in my behalf . The Lord is certainly blessing me . 
I Think maybe spring has sprung . The birds are singing joyfully in the mornings now . 
As some of you know , I had a complete hysterectomy a few weeks ago . Recovery is going well . I went to the doctor yesterday and he said that the cancer had not spread and I will not have to have any other treatments . Hallelujah and I thank the Lord . Thank you , too , for any prayers said in my behalf during the recent weeks . 
I just gave my dog a bath and now I'm all wet . 
Hi , < PROPFEMALE > , How's < PROPFEMALE > doing ? WE miss you guys . 
Visiting in Oklahoma . Had a nice picnic by the pond yesterday . So relaxing .
