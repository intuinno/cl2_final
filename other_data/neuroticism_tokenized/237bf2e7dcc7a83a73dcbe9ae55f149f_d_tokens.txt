Wow ! A deer came flying over the overpass and a car hit it below .

Some people should just admit that they are incapable of doing the job they were hired too do . 
I had lunch with a banana at the dinner table because I'm cool like that . 
I so need to get my hair done , but I do not want to pay a small fortune for it . 
Just got home from my massage 
Sleeping 11 hours , priceless . 
Oh No , I think I saw a snowflake < PROPFEMALE > , run to the store and stock up on milk , eggs , and water .

Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! 
6 Hours and Finally in < PROPMALE > . 
Sitting here trying to map out the QAM channels on the television . 
Don't people in < PROPFEMALE > have better things to do rather than call the sheriff about a neighbor's garbage , dude the people are moving out . 
Fireworks Pizza is calling my name . 
Let's see how the rest of my day will go . My house is a tropical rain < PROPMALE > because the system needs a recharge . My server room is a tropical rain < PROPMALE > ( AC is broken ) , had a power outage from the weekend , now the equipment is tripping circuits , and now a leaking roof . 
My hubby is running around looking for his bluetooth headset that Sparky toted off , haha . 
Headed to the Carolinas , yay ! 
I love how my cat has decided to stop my vacation plans by becoming sick . 
30 < PROPMALE > to < PROPMALE > 
< PROPFEMALE > Brothers for some BBQ 
I learned today that the E-ZPass of VA has no backup generator , no redundant links and etc . Furthermore , when there is a power outage the system isn't smart enough to even notify the administrator that their scheduled jobs did not run . I know this because I was the idiot on the Greenway in the SmartTag < PROPFIRST > with the bar down because of a power outage so therefore my credit card did not replenish , Gotta love it . 
Thankfully the radio stations around here have moved on from the Earthquake we had this morning , I am so glad for XM . 
Just made some homemade banana pudding for hubby , he likes it cold and I like mine warm , he will have to wait a while for it to cooldown . 
Headed to the gun show in Winchester 
6 hours and counting without power 
7 hours still no power ! 
The wealthiest county in the United States has the saddest county fair . 
Krispy Kreme , Hot and Now ! 
I have to drive all the way to NC for a cheerwine doughnut and Fat Tire beer . 
Sitting in the parking lot on I-95 . 
Home Sweet Home ! 
Just ordered the Droid 2 , can't wait till it gets here ! 
Today is \90210 \"!" 
Please pray for my < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > he has all of a sudden lost movement in his rear legs and the vets are puzzled as to why . 
Now the vet is telling me that he has spinal fracture and surgery may need to be done in order for him to obtain movement in his rear legs . 
Poor < PROPFEMALE > , gettting ready for his spinal tap ! 
Poor < PROPMALE > , has an IV attached on one end and a catheter attached on the other end . His myelogram has been completed and he has a ruptured disc that can only be fixed with surgery , waaaahhhhhhhhhhh ! 
Happy Halloween ! 
Tamale Pie , yum ! 
I love waking up and cleaning up cat puke ! 
People are already outside of the bestbuy ! 
9 degrees , brrrrr ! 
Back to the vet 
Up at 6:00 am , back to the vet at 7:00 am to drop off sick < PROPFEMALE > , TPMS went off on the Xterra , Broken Wood screw in the tire tread , the Hydraulic < PROPFIRST > quit working , Finally got the truck < PROPFIRST > ed with the factory < PROPFIRST > , patched the tire and almost ready to get on the road . The upside of all this we were home when the final Fedex package arrived . 
Yay , just crossed the NC border ! 
6:00 is way too early to be up on a Sunday ! 
Do any of the restaurants in San < PROPMALE > have heat , it is in the forties here .
