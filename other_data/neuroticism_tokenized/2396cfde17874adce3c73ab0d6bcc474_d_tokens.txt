Best 2 months ever :) 

thank you to everyone who is praying for me , < PROPMALE>'s family , and my own . he's the best person i know and life without him is never going to be the same . 
Standing on the track , looking up into the stands . Waiting for him , but he never comes down . It's finally sinking in and i know i'm lonely again . This new normal i'm living doesn't feel right with out him ...... i miss you so much < PROPMALE > , and i hope you know i'm still thinking of you every second of every day . \ 
i love you .

Why do they shoot me down , does anyone really see me ? Do they see that I'm already lying here on the ground ? Pain is no longer a feeling , it is who I am now .

An unfamiliar feeling called happiness finally starts to appear within me . This feeling shows me courage , strength , and integrity .... I'm no longer numb .
