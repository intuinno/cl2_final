Going down to Huntington Beach ! Laying out in the sun in my new bikini ! ( Maybe meet a tall , dark , and handsome beach boy ? ) Lol . 

Is tired from going to the beach . 
Laughter is life . Life is love . Love is the people who love , care , and support you not matter what you do . Live , laugh , and love with all that you are , for life is too short to be taken for granted .

OMG ! I JUST WITNESSED A KNOCKOUT FIGHT AT THE MOVIE THEATER LAST NIGHT AT 10:50 ! I SAW ALL OF IT FIGHT RIGHT DOWN TO A GUY BEING KNOCKOUT COLD ! IT WAS SUPPER SCARY AND YET I WANTED TO STEP IN A STOP THE FIGHT ! MY FRIEND WAS TRYING TO PULL ME AWAY BUT I JUST COULD NOT LEAVE ! THE POOR GUY WHO GOT HIT FELL TO THE GROUND AND WAS KNOCKOUT . THE MAN THAT PUNCH SAID GUY RAN FOR IT ! I AM STILL COMPLETELY SHAKEN FROM THIS !!!!! 
Only two more weeks of summer ! How sad . 
I hope that days come easy and the moments pass slow . And each days leads you where you want to go . If you're faced with a choice , and you have to choose . I hope you choose the one that means the most to you . And if one door opens to another door closed . I hope you keep on walking ' til you find the windows . Oh , if it's cold outside , show the world the warmth of your smile !
