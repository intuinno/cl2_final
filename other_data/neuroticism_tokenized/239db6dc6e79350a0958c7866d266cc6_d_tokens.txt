This first week of school has been very hard . I really didnt think it would be this much bad trying to balance school , a baby and taking care of a house is tiring . Im sure i will get the < PROPFEMALE > out it soon but for now i'm just tired . Just got done studying . I had to stop cause the words started to look like there were mixed together . Clean the house and took a shower and now i need to go to sleep . Get < PROPFIRST > in the a.m

has been researching potty training ... it seems like the magic age is 18 months ... it seems that kids that start at this age take to the potty the best ... but some of the things they say to do are just stupid .... i will totally be blogging about this on myspace when we start potty training 
going to bed ... hope < PROPFIRST > sleeps well ... got another A on my test last thursday and quiz today

Watching Dr. Phil about women that cant have babies and its so sad .... i'll never understand why stupid people that dont want kids can get pregnant and women that really want babies cant ... all i no is im very lucky to have my little man 
we had are first potty training experience today that did work out right but i was still happy ... we were in the bathroom and < PROPFIRST > started to pull at his diaper so i took it off and he point down to his penis so i showed him the potty ... well he walked away for a minute and then turned and started to run towards the potty and right before he got to it he peed .. i just told him next time that is where his pee goes 
sitting in keyboarding waiting to take my final ... i have to wait till after break to take it which is still an hour and 20 minutes away and im bored .. no one is ever on here to talk to 
OMG ... another 34 minutes of nothing to do ... im gonna go nuts ... looking at a computer for 2 hours is so boring 
at home alone again .... going to bed ... i miss my little man 
i hurt my foot like 3 days ago and it still hurts to walk on it 
wondering if < PROPFIRST > could actually be anymore annoying 
I have bronchitis and i think i might die

finally have a wedding date pick out october 16 , 2010 ... lots of things to do to get this planned 
just realized i was on seans facebook anyways going to look at a wedding chapel on friday 
so im pretty sure i already no what chapel and hall i want for my wedding but i still gotta go look at them first ... busy on firday 
So first the house a few doors down gets shot up and then when i go in the hallway to look and see whats going on me < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > all get locked out with both kids stuck in the house ... a 4 year old and 18 month old what a good combination ... i almost cried but < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > got the door opened and when we got inside both kids were still fast asleep 
so tomorrow we put the deposits on the hall and chapel and then i can start working on everything else ... school tomorrow night 
wedding stuff ... i still have 10 months and i already feel stressed out 
so when i get home < PROPFIRST > was sleeping but < PROPFIRST > didn't change his clothes or give him a bath or brush his teeth .. how hard is it to remember to give a baby a bath and put his p . j's on 
i want to dye my hair tonight 
the bump on < PROPFIRST > head is a lump of blood from his fall back in august that hardened and is going to eventually going to turn into bone and fuse with his skull 
cant wait for finals to be over on Thursday ... then a 2 week break thank god 
to scared to go to bed ... i can't believe someone broke into the house ... i just don't feel safe anymore 
was to scared to sleep last night 
still have alot to do in tylers room ... sean worked on it all night and just went to bed at 8 am ... im gonna get something to eat and go to sleep 
home now bed 
such a bad headache from my hangover .. that shot of juice was strong lol .. next year i will be drinking cause i promise i won't be pregnant 
so i took the paci today ... this year i want to have < PROPFIRST > potty trained , off the paci and off those sippy cups that he has had since he was 9 months .. we took the sippy cups last week and got him new big boy ones ... today i took the paci .. so i guess its all just potty training now 
< PROPFIRST > is freaking out ... he wants his paci .. this is gonna be hard 
back on facebook for now ... sean is coming home today so im going back home after school ... 
So I almost died last night . When i was on my was home from my moms on 94 we slid and did a 360 so we had cars coming at us head on . We were only going 35 
< PROPFIRST > is sleeping and im getting ready to go to bed soon .. just have to finish cleaning up .. tomorrow will be a fun day of washing clothes , studying , and lots of cleaning 
so i have homework to do and i need to clean the house ... hoping < PROPFIRST > sleeps all night but i no he won't ... i need to start writing my paper for school to ... At least i washed all the clothes 
going to bed soon ... I really need to start planning my wedding ... just never have enough time to think about it

At school ... just got done taking a test ... i have alot of school stuff to get done 
Just talked to my mom ... she is at the hospital with my grandma ... Grandma has congestive heart failure .. she will be in the hospital for a few days mom said that this is completely treatable and not life threatening 
No School till Wednesday 
Getting ready to start my papaer . I will not be on here until i get the first draft done . At least that is what i keep telling myself 
I really hope 2010 is gonna get better because so far it has been pretty crap ... everyone is sick , dying or has died ... and the new year only started 18 days ago ... but there are lots of things to look forward to like my wedding and finishing school 
Just got back from melissa's .. tyler is alittle sick .. he had a fever earlier but its gone now and he was throwing up 
It is 3 A.M and i am up with < PROPFIRST > watching cartoons ... I haven't been a sleep yet ... < PROPFIRST > has a fever .. dont no how high cause he will not let me take his temperture but when he pulled the thermometer out of his armpit it said 100.4 
So its 4:30 and were stilll up ... tyler still have a fever but it is going down ... i have found 3 new websites that im not addicted to ... lamebook.com ... fmylife.com and textsfromlastnight.com 
tylers finally went to bed at 5 and his fever was gone ... when we woke up it was back ... right now its 100.6 and he is throwing up again ... now he has a cough too 
OMG how sad is it that im so excited to see the new seanson of 16 and pregnant 
So ready to go home ... im so hungry right now ... gonna call < PROPFIRST > when i get out of here and see where he is 
So < PROPFIRST > was up all night again just crying ... im pretty tired now after 3 days off this .. we are doing EKG's night at school 
ok if i hear one more person telling me how lucky was to have a c-section because they dont hurt im gonna seriously punch someone .. They do hurt .... really bad actually .. and it hurts for a long time afterward ... either way you have a baby it hurts 
just watched pregnancy pact ... i wanted to hit those girls in the face ... anyone that gets pregnant ON PURPOSE when they no they have no way to support a baby is stupid ... why would you try to bring another human into this world when you no you can't take care of it 
waiting for < PROPFIRST > to get home .. i have alot i need to do i just dont feel like moving ... well i better start cleaning soon 
my head is pounding so mad ... i think i might die ... i just want to go to bed but i still have 5 hours of school 
going to dinner and a movie this weekend ... it's been almost a year since me and have done that ... im very excited 
Watching american idol and then watching teen mom .. and i need to study 
Thinking about gonig back to school after i become an C < PROPFEMALE > to do the dialysis p . c . technician program .. I would only have to complete the classes that i didn't take with the < PROPFEMALE > program .. So it would only be another 3 months of school and a 6 week externship .. then i would be a C < PROPFEMALE > and a DPCT 
test tonight and then more EKGs 
i hate the hospitals but they were really nice ... 4 hours there tonight and it sucked ... tyler has croup ... I wish he didnt but at least it isn't as bad as when he had RSV 
I hate this class so much . I really want to go home 
< PROPFIRST > is getting induced tomorrow at 7p . m ... i very excited 
< PROPFIRST > is getting induced tonight at 7 .. im so excited to see < PROPMALE > 
sitting in class waiting to hear < PROPFIRST > tell me the baby is here 
going shopping with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > 
< PROPFIRST > has 4 cavities ... two of them are really bad ... so he has to have work done on them ... on the 23rd he goes in to have the decay scraped out of his front two teeth and then have medication put in them ... then 2 weeks later he has to have all four filled ... my poor baby ... they are gonna put him in something they call a sleeping bag so he cant move ... i feel so bad for him 
still working on homework 
watching i didn't no i was pregnant ... i still get freaked out when i watch this cause i just keep thinking a few more weeks and that would have been me .. i dont even no what i would do if that happened to me 
easiest final ever tonight ... happy that class is over ... another final tomorrow and then the weekend thank god .. 
hoping my hair dont fall out cause im dying it for the three time today ... having dark hair sucks nothing shows up ... going shopping tomorrow and then going out with < PROPFIRST > at night as long as < PROPFIRST > will stay with my mom 
guess im dying my hair yet again ... sean just told me my hair is bright red which its not ... but anyways going shopping and then out tonight 
I really need a stove ... mine has been broken for like 3 months so that gives me two choices when i cook ... i can have food that is burned or raw ... neither one tastes good 
5 and a half months left till im done with school ... it seems like forever 
taking < PROPFIRST > to < PROPFIRST>'s for a little while so i can get some more stuff for the wedding ... then i have to study 
another night terror .. tyler woke up screaming .. it went on for about 15 minutes ... he wouldn't snap out of it no matter how hard i tried to help .. even when he finally opened his eyes he was still screaming and his eyes looked weird .. i really wish these night terrors would end 
i dont wanna go out in this snow but i have to .... going to get my bc and then to my moms ... waiting to see if school reopens 
< PROPFIRST > did really good at the dentist today .. the nurse said he only cried a little and that he was a good boy ... they put medicine in his two front teeth and he goes back in 3 weeks for the 4 fillings 
Wednesday i need people with good veins to let me draw their blood . I need to have 3 more good blood draws by tomorrow or i cant pass the class . I think it is so stupid that they have a class of 20 when we all need 6 blood draws in 3 classes . It is not possible in my opinion 
all my blood draws are done thank god . 
Just realized i need to start planning < PROPFIRST > s birthday party ... most likely it will be May 1st ... I remembered everyone this time lol ... hoping to go see my dad this weekend if i can get someone to watch < PROPFIRST > 
going to get some things for tylers birthday party 
went to party city and got some things for tylers birthday ... doing a < PROPFEMALE > the pooh theme ... going to see my dad tomorrow 
putting wedding stuff on hold till after tylers birthday ... my goal is to go get the < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s dresses the weekend after tylers party 
I need to take a bath but i no the second i get in there < PROPFIRST > will wake up 
do i no my son or what ... 10 minutes into my bath and he woke up ... of course i had conditioner in my hair ... so i had to grab a towel and run into his room just to find out he refuses to go back to sleep .. i would really like to finish my bath 
going to my moms for a little bit ... moving tylers party from the 1st to the 8th ... invitations will be out in a few weeks 
Dear God , I was wondering if it was possible for you to give me a 5 minute break before you throw yet another thing i can't handle at me . The end . So now my refridgeator is broken and the stove is broken . Being stressed 24/7 isn't really working for me . 
taking < PROPFIRST > to the dentist in the morning 
poor baby the medicine in < PROPFIRST>'s front two teeth did not take .. so they put more medicine in this teeth and if it still doesn't take they have to pull his teeth 
really hoping that the medicine takes this time i dont want my poor baby to have to have his teeth pulled ... my poor little man 
< PROPFIRST > is still sick ... he has been up 3 times already ... he has a very bad cough 
I have finals next week .. I have lots of studying to do this weekend

who thinks < PROPFIRST > should watch < PROPFIRST > while i sleep since im sick and feel like im dying 
I only need 4 more wooden boards 
If you know weather or not your coming to tylers birthday party can you let me know ... i still have a few invites to get out but im doing that today 
some people only learn the hard way 
omg im so sick .. it would be so nice if < PROPFIRST > slept good tonight ... im so freaking weak and tired ... and i had to clean today ... atleast < PROPFIRST > did the dishes and cooked dinner 
I traded eyeliner for dark circles , salon hair cuts for ponytails & hairclips , long showers for hairy legs , late nights for early mornings , designer purses for diaper bags , and I wouldn't change a thing ! With Mother's day drawing near , let's see how many moms repost this . Moms don't mind making sacrifices and will continue to give things up for their kids ... that is true love .

Coloring my hair and then going to bed ... gettint < PROPFIRST > in the morning 
9 weeks and counting i cant wait 
just found tylers sipppy that was missing for two weeks ... it was full of apple juice in his ball pit .... appple juice that has been sitting in 90 degree weather for two weeks does not smell good ..

taking < PROPFIRST > to the zoo today 
uploading pictures o f < PROPFIRST > for the zoo today ... there arent actually alot of < PROPFIRST > because < PROPFIRST > was to into all the animals .... 
it would be really nice if people were more considerate . i think when two people are in a relationship it should be there decision what is or is not done during that relationship . i think i should be shown some respect seeing how i am the Tylers mother ... me and < PROPFIRST > will decide what is okay for us and you should worry about keeping private things ( like peoples phone numbers)private . 
stuck in horrible traffic on 94 
is it just me or have we been tested more in the last week then we have in 4 years ... i dont no what it was but im happy everything seems to be over .... and if not i still have some fight left in me ... but hopefully thing are gonna calm down for awhile 
according to the dr. < PROPMALE > show today a stay at home mom works the equivalent of two full time jobs ... i couldnt agree more 
yet another trip to the doctors with tyler ... this boy is accident prone i swear ... i thought he broke his foot but he is okay 
at the movies with < PROPFIRST > seeing grown ups 
I lost all my < PROPFIRST > even though they were saved to my sim card when i moved then to the new phone ... so i need everyones < PROPFIRST > 
ok i figured it out and i have all my < PROPFIRST > 
wonderful another 14 minutes till im another year older .. i dont want to have a birthday .. well i guess ready or not here comes 23 .. yay not 
happy birthday to me ... but < PROPFIRST > said its his birthday not mommas 
thanks from all the happy birthday comments .... thank god its over for a year cause birthdays arent fun anymore .. now they just mean im getting old 
stuck in traffic on 94 again ... with very little gas ... guess i should have gonna some before i tried going home 
on my way home i seen seven cars pulled over ... so i actually went the speed limit today 
making another attempt to shop tomorrow ... we will see how < PROPFIRST > feels about that .. he is so spoiled ... he got one toy from every story we went into today ... probably not a great habit to start 
< PROPFIRST > doesnt want to go shopping today 
At coreys to do fireworks 
< PROPFIRST > sprained his knee 
< PROPFIRST > still cant walk today ... he stood for a few seconds and he will crawl 
had alot of fun last night .... 
got to take < PROPFIRST > back to the doctor tomorrow cause he till cant walk right yet ... he was just there two weeks ago cause he hurt his foot ... there gonna think i beat this kid 
took < PROPFIRST > back to the doctor today ... said it looks like he just twisted it wrong ... he said to give it a few more days and come back if there is no improvement 
finally its not 100 out .... cleaning the house , making dinner , and doing homework 
im partying it up here on friday night ... just got done with some awesome bath time and next up were gonna rock out with a book .. and then it is night night time ... i no i no im just so hardcore 
so < PROPFIRST > went to bed at 9:30 and i just finished cleaning out his toys ... now i have to do dishes , put clothes away and clean the house for the third time today .... atleast im never bored 
really wish i could take < PROPFIRST > to the doctors tomorrow ... i think there is something seriously wrong with his leg ... its been a week and he can only walk if his leg is turned sideways ... thats not normal ... ive been to the doctor and to the er and they both said its a sprain ... if it is then again why cant he walk normal and why is his leg turned freakin sideways 
pretty annoyed today but whatever ... < PROPFIRST > played outside with his uncle < PROPFIRST > today and he didnt even get hurt lol j/k < PROPFIRST > ... to the doctors again tomorrow to see why he still cant walk 
going to the doctors with < PROPFIRST > at 2:30 for his leg again ... something is so not right with the way he walks ... when he runs it looks like his hip is out of place 
Had more xrays done on tylers hip ... im scared of what might be wrong ... doctor will call inthe morning 
If God never gives you more then you can handle why does it seem like im way in over my head 
hopes this works so < PROPFIRST > can come home for a few days before everything happens ... tyler wants his daddy .. he was asking for him all morning 
this is freakin crazy ... all the lawyers want atleast 5000 ... and the really good one wants 10000 .... There is no one that has that kinda money 
i no alot of people have been trying to call , text and write me on facebook lately .. dont take it personally when i dont answer i just dont feel like talking right now ... sean , me and < PROPFIRST > are just enjoying all the time we can together while we can

Toall the unselfish moms out there who traded eyeliner for dark circles , salon haircuts for ponytails , long showers for quick showers , late nights for early mornings , designer bags for diaper bags , and WOULD NOT change a thing . Lets see how many moms repost this . Moms who don't care ... about ... whatever they gave up , and instead LOVE what they get in return . Repost this if you're a mom and LOVE your KIDS !

< PROPFIRST > has been using the potty on and off for about two months ... but last week we started using a potty chart and today he got his first sticker for his potty chart 
little update about < PROPFIRST > for people that don't no yet ... he went to probation for the first time today to start his 3 years probation .. he will most likely be sentenced from Macomb county in December .. the lawyer said the best outcome for that will be 1 year in county jail and the worst will be somewhere around 4 years in prison 
watching tv and just learn that 20% of all marriages are between cousins ... that is pretty gross 
10 minute break before started to clean again

Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice - People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will ....... you make it your status for at least ... one hour ? Promote Love & Acceptance ! NOT hate . Period . 
so we have court again on the 29th .. not sure if there gonna offer < PROPFIRST > a plea deal or not .. if they do he will be sentenced right around christmas ... kinda ready to get this over with even though it means < PROPFIRST > will be going away for awhile ... i think waiting for him to go is worse then the thought of him actually being gone 
If you have a brother who has made you laugh , pulled your hair , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fall ( or tripped you ) , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , took your bike apart and never put it back together , and you love him with all of your heart , then copy ... & paste this to your status 
So < PROPFIRST > was making something to eat and said the butter was to hard so he had to melt it a little ... a few minutes later i go back in the kitchen and < PROPFIRST > says \i had to let the butter get hard again cause it melted all the way .. i don't no why i only put in in the microwave for one minute\ " .. how did he live the first 24 years of his life without me " 
using the internet on my phone sucks 
Another court date ... go back nov 24th 
everything happens for a reason 
really tired today ... waiting to watch my big friggin wedding and then going to bed 
feel like crap today ... 
im so freaking tired 
i really wish < PROPFIRST > would stop eating hot-dogs and ranch dressing 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ! 
Going to bed soon .. im so tired i feel like i could sleep for days 
< PROPFIRST > is a very good nurse ... still cleaning and making dinner 
watching ice age with < PROPFIRST >

taking a break from my day of cleaning to eat while < PROPFIRST > takes his nap 
i asked < PROPFIRST > to hand me the paper towel and he asked where it was .. so i said on the table ... his response was oh ok momma ... i said you know you're so cute and he said you're so cute too momma ... i think i have the cutest little boy in the world

feeling not so good ... about to get < PROPFIRST > dressed for the day 
so i guess my pregnancy is like the worst kept secret of the year lol .. so yes my eggo is preggo ... so far baby number 2 is supposed to be here around may 12th which makes me around 16 weeks .. but we all know that could change at any point with me lol .. go for my ultrasound next month to get a better idea of how far along i am 
i just spent 20 minutes dry heaving .. how can two pregnancies be so different .. i feel like crap and my back hurts now ... 
seriously i really feel like im dying today .. this is like the worst i have ever felt ... i just wanna go to sleep 
dear child inside of me ... we have to come to some kind of agreement ... i have to be able to keep some of the food i eat inside of my body 
< PROPFIRST > has been asleep for an hour and a half and < PROPFIRST > just fell asleep .. now it is time for me and baby chicken to watch sex in the city 2 
still have a week to wait till i go to the doctor .. its driving me crazy 
finally done cleaning ... now it's time to make dinner .. i have been craving a pizza sub but regular pizza makes me throw up .. this pregnancy is so weird 
slammed my finger in the car door today and it really hurts 
why am i up right now when < PROPFIRST > will be sleeping till 7:30 
stood in line for 2 hours at the Roseville tree lighting so < PROPFIRST > could see < PROPFEMALE > even though he is gonna see him again next week ... the things we do for our kids ... oh and seriously if your over the age of 8 you do not need to sit on < PROPFEMALE>'s lap 
so i was up all night last night cause not only was i sharing the bed with < PROPFIRST > the bed/cover hog but i also had < PROPFIRST > who moves all night in there and his guitar which he refused to sleep without 
just made cupcakes with < PROPFIRST > 
now < PROPFIRST > is running around saying i come in peace ... my kid is so weird 
finally done cleaning ... i've been at it for 5 hours and < PROPFIRST > should be home soon thank god cause < PROPFIRST > is driving me nuts 
God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ; courage to change the things I can ; and wisdom to know the difference . 
going to the doctors tomorrow finally and i will be able to set up an ultrasound 
doctors appointment at 1:15 .. i should be able to hear the heartbeat today .. it sucks that < PROPFIRST > can't be there with me but hopefully he can make it to one appointment before he goes away 
so i went to the doctors today .. they think im 17 weeks and gave me a due date of may 10th ... im high risk agian this time ... and i lost 3 pounds so suck it pregnancy im not gonna get fat this time 
so < PROPFIRST > took a plea deal today ... he plead guilty to two attempts to sell esctasy 2 counts of selling vicodin and 1 count of selling weed ... the maximum is gonna be 7 years and the minimum is 2 years but it is possible for him to get 1 year in county jail ... sentencing is < PROPFIRST > 11th 
i hate 24 hour this stupid 24 hour urine test ... you no how hard it is to remember i have to pee into something everytime i go to the bathroom all day long 
so if my doctors office opens at 9 shouldn't they have there answering service off by 9:17 ... really annoying 
beer 
dear morning sickness please can you go away and stay away ... im getting sick of this coming and going crap 
happy < PROPFIRST > is gonna to have a brother or sister soon cause he spends his day talking to himself and playing games by himself .. its a little sad 
feeling like shit and < PROPFIRST > is not being helpful 
feeling crappy again today ... why do i still have morning sickness at 18 weeks 
i have a freakin bacterial infection .. doctor is putting me on antibiotics ... i thought it was a little funny that the nurse was trying to reassure me that it wasn't and STD .. i wasn't really worried about having one of those lol 
going to bed with < PROPFIRST > cause i feel like crap 
how can i be so tired all day and up all night 
have to get motivated to clean up tylers toys today ... i haven't cleaned his toy room in a week cause there is no where to walk in there 
just ate a half a bag of dove peanut butter chocolates for a snack before lunch lol .. im just so freakin hungry 
So let me get this straight ... Larry < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ?? Really ?!?!?! Repost to your < PROPFEMALE > if you agree ? Proud to support equal rights for ALL ? 
went to bed at 9:30 last night .. and i was still tired when i woke up 
how was my day .. first my phone charger stopped working and then my computer charger broke .. i went to drain my meat for dinner and spilled all of it in the sink .. i burned myself while cooking and i think < PROPFIRST > was more hyper then ever .. can't wait till 9:30 so i can take a long peaceful bath 
at some point in this pregnancy i have to start feeling better ... right ? 
woke up hungry .. seriously i don't think i ever stop eating ... i don't wanna be hungry anymore 
had a dream about some pie and now im gonna have to go buy some 
so seen million dollar money drop and this is what i have to say .. if < PROPFIRST > had us bet all the money we won so far 800,000 dollars on an answer that he said he knew was 100 percent right but it turned out to be wrong ... im telling you right now i would kill him .. and i hope the women on the show does the same to her husband 
channel 4 is outside my house .. to bad its cause the house a few doors down got shot up ... seriously people its 4:30 in the morning 
going to < PROPFEMALE>'s in a little bit 
went through the attic to make room to put tylers old toys up .. we cleared a nice amount of space for tylers new toys 
< PROPFIRST > got alot of great presents .. can't wait till tomorrow to see his face

feeling sick agian ... hopefully it will pass 
me and < PROPFIRST > are both sick 
going shopping to see what we can get for this baby .. it would be way easier if i knew what i was having 
so we spent about 300 dollars today but we got so much stuff .. bassinet , swing chair , bouncer chair , tummy time gym , a dresser , diaper bag , play pen , bassinet sheets , < PROPMALE > , exersaucer ... happy we got so much .. only a few things to get later 
getting ready for the doctor today at 11 ... gotta ask her why i have shooting pains on my left side all the time and what i can do about being sick 24/7 
i had to have another ultrasound cause they couldn't find the heartbeat again and cause i haven't gained any weight .. doctor said the baby looks like a healthy 20 week baby .. and she also said that she is pretty sure the baby is a girl but when the baby did a flip she saw something that could have been a penis .. i'll no for sure on the 5th 
watching someone drink alcohol on tv just made me sick 
actually really excited for tomorrow ... going to an early dinner and then to see little fockers .. after that heading to < PROPFIRST>'s 
oh heartburn how i have missed you since my last pregnancy .. im so happy your back 
thankfully < PROPFIRST > went to bed early cause now everything is done and i can sleep 
so happy to be done with 2010 .. this year was full of disappointment , loss and struggle .. in 2011 even though < PROPFIRST > will be leaving i think that things will be better .. this new year i will welcome another baby as well as watch my older baby turn 3 .. and < PROPFIRST > might even get to come home at the end of the year 
< PROPFIRST > just told me that everyone is pregnant 
not feeling good today ... hoping < PROPFIRST > is good tomorrow at the dentist and has no cavities .. then the next day is my ultrasound .. hopefully the baby gives us a good shot so we know 100 percent what we are having 
gotta get up early to take < PROPFIRST > to the dentist 
getting ready to take < PROPFIRST > to the dentist .. he already cried about it once so i hope its not to bad ... and < PROPFIRST > may have anger issues .. he just told me he wanted to hurt < PROPFEMALE > 
< PROPFIRST > has two cavities that he has to have filled ... this time they are gonna sedate him so i have to pay a freakin 70 dollar fee 
morning sickness is back and its pissed off ... got sick 6 times today 
i love my kids but never will i get pregnant again ever ... throw up about 12 times now 
hoping to God that im gonna keep this food down and wishing i could sleep 
please God let me eat some food and keep it done ... leaving for my ultrasound soon .. and this better be a girl cause im not doing this again 
doctor was wrong by 6 weeks ... im only 14 weeks ... to early to tell the sex ... and the reason im showing so much is because this is my second they said 
i still feel like complete crap .. so im gonna lay down till its time to go to < PROPFIRST>'s and hopefully < PROPFIRST > will watch < PROPFIRST > ... these hormones are really getting to me .. i started crying at target like a crazy person 
so i deleted my post on accident but my new due date is july 3rd 
going to my moms house soon i hope so i can watch some tv 
off to my moms to wash clothes and going to dinner with her tonight 
really want to dye my hair .. i know that it's safe to do while your pregnant but i just can't bring myself to do it 
craving eggs , sausage and hash browns so < PROPFIRST > went to the store to get some for me 
having a hard time today .. i guess things really just hit me within the last hour .. tyler hasn't left < PROPFIRST>'s side all day .. its like he knows something is wrong 
just watched < PROPFIRST > say bye to < PROPFIRST > 
gonna try to go to sleep .. just ready to get tomorrow over with and go pick < PROPFIRST > up .. i don't plan on talking to many people tomorrow i just wanna spend time with < PROPFIRST > 
not even sure why i put makeup on .. its already coming off with my tears .. I know im not a very religious person but i do know there is a God and everything that happens he has a reason for

so far < PROPFIRST>'s release date is feb . 2nd .. he can still get out earlier then that though 
finally things are starting to feel okay again ... i have lots of people to write back tonight ... doctors appointment at 4 tomorrow 
doctors today ... so the doctors and the ultrasound have now completely confirmed that my official due date july 4th .. still haven't gained any weight .. actually lost another pound 
so last night was my first time ever sleeping somewhere all alone .. i had plans to get stuff done last night but i fell asleep at 10 so that didn't work out 
Do I work ? Uh , yeah I work . 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . Why ? Because I'm a MOM . I'm a cook , a cleaner , a teacher , a referee , a nanny , a nurse , a handyman , a maid , a security officer , a photographer , a counselor , a chauffeur and a comforter . I don't get holidays , sick pay or ANY days off . I work through the DAY and NIGHT . I am on call ALL hours . Tell me your job is harder than mine . Post if you are a proud MOM ! :) 
i am frickin starving again .. and i think i have an addiction to pizza rolls .. seriously they are the only thing i like eating and the only thing that never gave me morning sickness 
half way done with my midnight cleaning spree 
its 1:45 in the morning and i just finished the cleaning ... now tomorrow all i have to do is clean my room and the landing yay ... eating some more pizza rolls and writing an email then hopeful going to bed .. oh and i have scared the crap out of myself about 1000 times tonight .. i seriously don't do good alone lol 
waiting for the damn doctor to call to see when my ultrasound is so i know when we are going to find out what we are having 
i swear i think my doctors office is full of complete morons .. you tell me you'll call by noon with my ultrasound date .. and if you don't call i should call you .. while i just called cause it's after noon and you still don't have my freaking ultrasound time .. and i swear the < PROPFEMALE>'s there are so bitchy .. and the lady i just talked to must want me to kick her in her face cause she has an attitude 
thanks for calling me back about my ultrasound .. i swear these people are so stupid .. and now there closed till Monday .. i seriously want to switch my doctor 
So at least the doctors office will answer my moms questions ... now i have to wait for monday to find out what day my ultrasound will be 
< PROPFIRST > being gone is finally hitting < PROPFIRST > .. he just told me i miss daddy and i want him .. thank God it will only be a couple more weeks 
i have been feeling flutters in my stomach for that last 10 minutes .. its making it a little hard to go to sleep 
going to see < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > then get a few things from the store .. cleaning up the house tonight and going to see < PROPFIRST > tomorrow 
went to see < PROPFIRST > today ... he looked pretty good and said he was doing okay 
stupid morning sickness ... just when i think your gone you come back 
getting ready to go to the hematologist ... i really hate going to these kinda of appointments but maybe this doctor will be quick

took a cleaning break to eat lunch ... but i don't think cookie dough and pizza rolls were such a good idea .. now my stomach hurts 
seriously cookie dough and pizza rolls are not a good idea 
just finished cleaning .. me and < PROPFIRST > were jammin out to backstreet boys while we worked .. his new favorite song .. \if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy \""

in my car outside the jail wait to go in ... i always get here to early 
im so freaking tired today .. cant wait to go to bed 
Kentucky just passed the best law ever . To be on Foodstamps , Medicaid , Cash Assistance for your Children or yourself . You have to pass a DRUG TEST . Now every other state should do the same ! If you agree re-post . People that work have to take a drug test so should they 
Dumb people should not be allowed to have children ... just because a boy plays with girl toys it does not make he gay and if a little girl plays with boy toys there not a lesbian .. i mean seriously people are just so closed minded 
at my brothers house waiting on the pizza to get here 
going home soon ... haven't been there in a few days 
< PROPFIRST>'s taking a bath because we had a bit of an accident here .. potty training is not working out 
< PROPFIRST > comes home in 63 hours 
so pissed right now i just missed < PROPFIRST>'s phone call 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy .. but you will ALWAYS love them . Repost if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are 
feeling crappy today but at least i get to go see < PROPFIRST > tomorrow and then he gets out ... I really hope we don't get the sown storm ... news just said were gonna get between 12-18 inches 
3 rooms clean 3 more and the landing to go ... < PROPFIRST > is at my grandmas tonight and i really miss him .. its been just me and him for the last month so its pretty lonely when he is gone .. on a good note 36 hours till < PROPFIRST > comes home 
so happy that i get to go out in a blizzard to get < PROPFIRST > when he is released ... i have no idea how im doing this 
getting ready to go see < PROPFIRST > for the last time ... 19 hours till he comes home ... but only 9 hours till the blizzard starts 
i don't no why i get nervous everytime i go see < PROPFIRST > ... leaving to see him now 
< PROPFIRST > just called he gets out at midnight so only 7 hours till he comes home 
really not looking forward to driving in this weather .. Would it be wrong to make < PROPFIRST > walk home lol 
seriously how am i hungry again 
< PROPFIRST > has not left < PROPFIRST>'s side yet 
i cant wait for american idol 
< PROPFIRST > fell asleep on the couch and when i went to move him into his bed he jumped up and yelled where is my daddy ... i don't think < PROPFIRST > is ever getting away from him again 
i just ate a whole box of rainbow cookies ... i can't stop eating 
can't wait for the packers to win so i can prove < PROPFIRST > wrong again 
the packers won just like i said 
feeling sick today ... going to bed as soon as < PROPFIRST > does 
doctors tomorrow .. hoping the doctor will tell me what i'm having .. if not i have to wait till my ultrasound at the hospital next week 
It's Nieces Week ! If you have a beautiful niece or nieces that you\ 
love more than you can describe , copy and paste this to your\ 
status for a little while , but hold them in your heart for a lifetime ! 
i just read someones facebook status and almost peed on myself 
so halfway through my pregnancy and i only gained one pound yay me ... this was the first time they didnt have to do a ultrasound to get the heartbeat ... im measuring right at 19 weeks and the heartbeat was 149 ... 
cleaning up while < PROPFIRST > is at probation and then going to get < PROPFIRST > ... 4 days until my ultrasound 
its 7:25 and < PROPFIRST > is passed out ... im gonna be up at 5:30 in the morning 
washing clothes all day ... < PROPFIRST > is going to see yogi bear with his meema and going to jeepers 
ive been washing clothes since 10 in the morning and i still have some waiting to go into the washer ... on a happy note only 2 days till i find out the sex of the baby 
making < PROPFIRST > sleep in his room for the first time in 6 months and im freaking out about it 
12 hours till i find out the sex of the baby .. it would be nice if it was a girl but i really really feel like its a boy 
heartburn please go away 
just gave < PROPFIRST > his vday gift and now its bed time up early for my ultrasound 
exchanged gifts with < PROPFIRST > last night for vday .. i have something small to give < PROPFIRST > too ... and i find out what im having in an hour and a half 
never watch a women give birth ... even if it is your second child 
ITS A GIRL 
it's been a great valentines day ... found out im having a GIRL .. got cards from < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > .. me and < PROPFIRST > just made cupcakes and we are getting ready to frost them soon 
We were given : Two hands to hold . Two legs to walk . Two eyes to see . Two ears to listen . But why only one heart ? Because the other was given to someone else . For us to find 
so the paci is gone for good .. everyone pray for me lol .. and tomorrow we start working hard on potty training 
< PROPFIRST > used his potty today .. and he even told me when he needed to go ... he is still pretty mad that i took his paci but its not as bad as i thought it would be 
starting to plan stuff out for < PROPFIRST>'s birthday party .. so far all i no is its gonna be May 7th 
not only did i ate my breakfast as well as finishing tylers left overs but i just ate the rest of my rainbow cookies .. pregnant or not i think i went over board lol 
so i wasn't gonna do a bounce house for < PROPFIRST>'s birthday this year but he really wants one ... so now im looking up bounce house rentals ... so everyone can get excited cause there will be a bounce house after all .. just wish it didn't cost 200 dollars to rent one 
got some clothes for the baby today and getting some more stuff tomorrow ... i think it was easier shopping for a boy 
just got done shopping for more baby clothes ... putting the new bedding on the crib and cleaning then taking < PROPFIRST > to my grandmas later so me and < PROPFIRST > can go to dinner and a movie 
so we paid for < PROPFIRST>'s bounce house 3 months ahead of time so we could save 20 dollars lol ... he is having a batman party this year 
im wearing my flip flops today and pretty soon i can go buy some new sunglasses 
so i have everything for tylers birthday already ... only thing left to do is get the food and cake when its time for the party .. oh and wait the 3 months till his party 
is pissed that my internet doesnt work cause some dumb ass wanted to start a fire a few houses down 
i need my internet fixed ... stupid at&t when the hell are you coming 
yay the internet is back on after 3 days ... to tired to do anything right now .. just getting ready to go to bed 
american idol and then bed .. when will i stop being tired all the time 
only one room left to clean but i don't wanna move ... i think ill just sit here with my chocolate and wait till < PROPFIRST > wakes up to finish cleaning 
< PROPFIRST > starts work tomorrow .. thank God cause he was starting to annoy me .. wonder how he is gonna like getting up at 5 in the morning 
So im stuck on baby names ... Its between Adalyn Grace , Briella < PROPFEMALE > and Mia < PROPFEMALE > 
morning sickness has been coming back lately .. this little girl doesn't like food at all 
so < PROPFIRST > woke up at 1:45 this morning cause he got a text message and thought it was his alarm to go to work lol ... at least he realized it before he got ready for work 3 hours early 
< PROPFIRST > is finally on his way home .. waiting for the lasagna to be done cause im freaking hungry 
lots of laundry to do today and then if there is enough time me and < PROPFIRST > are gonna see hall pass 
So as of right now we are going to name the baby mia < PROPFEMALE > 
hall pass was really funny .. i learned some new words during the movie too 
making dinner and writing a list of all the things i want to clean tomorrow ... i have some serious nesting going on 
internet is out again ... i hate at&t 
watching coming home and then going to bed 
so much cleaning to do today ... at least once the new baby comes i will have a reason to have a messy house for a couples weeks 
i just hit the 6 month < PROPFIRST > in my pregnancy and now all the sudden i feel like im dying ... i can't sleep , my back hurts , and i feel like a whale ... my first pregnancy was so much easier 
taking a break from cleaning to eat lunch and relax while < PROPFIRST > is taking a nap 
finally finished cleaning ... i think i have OCD cause i clean everyday for 3 to 4 hours and my house is not big .. im so tired today .. ill just sit right here till its time to make dinner 
i want mcdonalds breakfest 
Went for my 6 month check up today ... baby is doing good and measuring just right ... i only gained 5 pounds so far ... i have another ultrasound next week to see how the baby is growing 
time to start cleaning for the day 
so happy to be done cleaning ... nothing to do now till dinner time ... so ready for tylers nap in 15 minutes 
omg im not gonna make it another 3 months .. i can't move cause my back hurts so bad and my stomach feels so heavy im pretty sure that im starting to waddle 
laying down while < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > play video games 
me < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > were up late last night fixing some mistakes ... thank God i got some decaf coffee at the store yesterday cause its like my replacement cigarette since i got pregnant .. lots of cleaning and potty training today 
Respect : to show consideration for ; treat courteously or kindly 
< PROPFIRST > is taking a nap and i get to eat lunch in peace 
< PROPFIRST > found a way to stay up 15 minutes passed his bed time ... he tells < PROPFIRST > that he's hungry cause he knows < PROPFIRST > will feed him .. even though we both no he isn't hungry 
going to my moms today cause i have another ultrasound tomorrow and no car now that < PROPFIRST > is working .. i hope no one is having a baby tomorrow cause then im gonna have to wait forever for an ultrasound 
i selpt in till 8 this morning and im still tired 
i feel like i should just move in to my doctors office since im gonna be there all the time now ... my regular doctors appointments are every 2 weeks now and i have to have an ultrasound every 4 weeks 
no coffee today since im at my moms .. ultrasound at 1 
why did i teach < PROPFIRST > to talk .. its not fun arguing with a 2 1/2 year old especially when he wins most of the time .. but it is pretty funny to hear him say \say your prayers\ " before he shoots me with his machine gun " 
so today < PROPFIRST > said \ break it down\ " and then started to do his form of break dancing .. my kid is so weird " 
really thinking about getting up at 6:30 so i can have a cup of coffee in peace 
its st. patricks day ... gotta find something green for my little < PROPFEMALE > boy to wear 
< PROPFIRST > just told me he wants to wear his underwear .. he thinks putting on spider man underwear makes him turn into spider man 
gotta start cleaning but i really dont want to .. i want some frosting 
finally the house is clean now i can relax till its time to make dinner .. tyler is still napping i think i should wake him up its been 2 1/2 hours 
Dear bed time i love you more than anything in the world . Only 45 minutes till tylers bed time thank God im worn out . 
< PROPFIRST > keeps calling < PROPFIRST > \daddy < PROPFIRST >\"" 
i was attacked by my vacuum today .. i swear i think some things only happen to me lol ... hopefully < PROPFIRST > can fix the vacuum when he gets home cause i think i might have broke it more when i tired to fix it lol 
i got a new vacuum today yay me 
i seriously need to get out .. i have been stuck in my house 24/7 since < PROPFIRST > started working 
FU potty training i really hate you .... tyler just doesnt want to use the potty ... 
why does this baby like kicking me so much .. i swear people probably think im crazy cause i jump every time she kicks me .. based on the way my pregnancies have gone im gonna say that this baby is gonna be nothing like her brother ... thank God cause the world is not ready for another < PROPFIRST > 
i think that the new car seat rules are really stupid .. i don't think that kids should have to be rear facing till 2 .. and seriously making kids ride in a high back booster seat till there 4 foot 9 or 12 years old really 
so i have tried every way possible to potty train < PROPFIRST > and it has not worked .. he is so stubborn .. so next week when i have no where to go for the whole week we are gonna try the naked method .. this is my last resort .. i have never hated something as much as i hate potty training 
you know what is really annoying .. waking someone up four times to let them know that its getting late and they need to get there stuff ready for work in the morning only to hear them say there not sleeping there just resting there eyes ... last time i checked when you rest your eyes you don't snore 
no more Chinese food till after i have this baby .. it gives me way to much heart burn 
gonna try to go to bed but this baby is kicking non stop so i don't no if that is gonna happen or not 
I have to send tylers birthday invitations out soon .. i really hate writing them out and < PROPFIRST > makes fun of my cause i write like a 5 year old ... tyler will be 3 in 6 weeks .. and 3 years ago today i didn't even know i was pregnant yet lol 
i have some serious OCD cleaning going on today ... nesting like crazy 
i just cleaned out tylers closet and got rid of 2 garbage bags full of his 2T clothes that don't fit him anymore ... now im hoping i can get rid of all the toys he doesn't play with while he takes his nap .. 
well i got one garbage bag full of toys good but there is still a lot .. relaxing while < PROPFIRST > naps and then finishing the cleaning 
omg i am so sore .. i just cleaned for 7 hours ... and i mean i did some serious cleaning .. i think i might have done alittle to much though cause now my stomach and back are killing me .. thank God < PROPFIRST > is gonna go stay at my grandmas tonight so i don't have to drop him off in the morning before the doctor 
If your babys beautiful and perfect , never cries or fusses , sleeps on schedule and burps on demand , an angel all the time ,  youre the grandma 
so freaking tired im going to bed ... Doctors tomorrow for my check up and GD test .. I hate that stuff you have to drink .. hopefully this time it wont make me wanna throw up 
ok so its 2:24 a.m and im still awake .. im so tired and i can't sleep ... tyler is with my grandma tonight so it would be the perfect night to rest if i could ever fall asleep 
< PROPFIRST > should never try to make a pregnant person feel better lol .. last night i was upset cause i look like a freaking whale now and seans exact words were \you're not fat your stomach is just big\ " .. that really didn't make me feel better but at least it made me laugh cause he sounded so stupid " 
just did my GD test ... now i have to wait another 50 minutes to get my blood drawn 
so the doctors went good today .. baby is in the 78th percentile ... did my GD test and didnt want to throw up this time ... so far i have only gained 7 pounds with 15 weeks left to go 
< PROPFIRST > is finally sleeping .. it only took 15 minutes for him to fall asleep tonight .. so i decided anyone with more then two kids has to be freaking nuts .. at the end of the night im so tired i feel like i can't move .. so i don't no how anymore could take care of 2 or 3 kids while being pregnant 
enjoying the few minutes of peace with my cup of coffee while < PROPFIRST > sleeps 
completely surprised that < PROPFIRST > is still sleeping at 9 a.m 
looking forward to the weekend .. i love < PROPFIRST > but its gonna be nice to just relax for a day 
really don't feel good at all ... so ready for july so i can get this baby out 
it would be really nice if i could take a nice hot bath at the end of a long stressful day but < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > used all the hot water .. so i got to take yet another quick cold bath 
Dear Mia , Your mother is gonna have a hard time getting through the doorway if you don't stop with these constant cravings . Also im tired and your brother gets up at 7 a.m so can you go to sleep for the night and stop moving around so much so that I can get some sleep . 
feels like crap and < PROPFIRST > is being a brat 
Today i will not clean lol ... ok well maybe just a little but not like i normally do .. i think i have been over doing it lately so im gonna try to just relax for a few days 
so the doctor just called ... my platelets dropped again ... there only 49,000 now so i have to be put on steroids to try to get them up ... plus i failed my GD test so i have to go back for the 3 hour one .. the steroids are gonna make but blood sugars go up anyway so now im gonna have to be put on a diabetic diet .. probably gonna be late to the reception tonight now 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > had a really nice reception ... it sucks that i felt to sick to really enjoy it .. plus with everything i found out today i was just in a bad mood .. so happy to be going to bed now 
i dont no what this crazy baby is doing but she just made the weirdest move and i almost peed on myself lol .. i no that by the time this pregnancy is over i will have peed on myself at least once 
i have been running around so much this weekend ... yesterday me and < PROPFIRST > spent all day shopping for the new baby .. we got alot of new clothes .. its a little depressing though cause we have been shopping for this baby since January and we still need tons of clothes .. going through tylers old clothes soon cause i know we have some neutral stuff in there 
almost got in an accident today cause people can't drive ... i hate when dumb ass people don't look before they try to get over 
so i found away a way to get < PROPFIRST > to use his potty ... when i know he has to go i sit him on his potty and let him play a game or watch tv and he goes ... he was so excited that he peed in his potty today 
watching my soul to take then going to bed .. i think < PROPFIRST > was a little tried cause he fell asleep in about 5 minutes tonight .. normally it takes about 20 minutes of me yelling go to bed 
Dear dumb < PROPFEMALE>'s that work at my doctors office , once 8:30 comes and your office opens your supposed to turn your answering service off and actual answer the calls from patients . 
So today i told < PROPFIRST > that they don't make diapers anymore .. he wore underwear all day and only used pull ups at nap time and bed time ... he had some accidents but he also used his potty 4 times today 
< PROPFIRST > is doing so good with his potty training now ... he even tells me when he has to use the potty .. hope he keeps it up 
doctors tomorrow at 10:30 to talk about my platelets and see if they went up or not .. and i have to set up a 3 hour GD test 
doctors at 10:30 .. i hate sitting there by myself .. hopefully its only good news 
so no accidents for < PROPFIRST > today and he used his potty twice 
decided with the doctor today to do a repeat c-section ... ill be scheduling it around my 34 week and delivering during my 39th week ... so sometime between june 27th and july 3rd she will be here as long as everything goes as planned 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Birdwell , May 5th , 2008 , 36 weeks , 4lbs 15oz , 18 inches long , born at 10:35 p.m ? If your a proud mama repost with name , date , length of pregnancy , labor time , baby weight , height and time 
So i need everyones address cause im sending out tylers birthday party invitations in a few days 
so proud of < PROPFIRST > its 8:30 and still no accidents .. he used his potty all day 
I know i said this last night but i need everyones address cause im sending out tylers invitations this weekend 
another day with no accidents for < PROPFIRST >
