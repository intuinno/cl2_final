Stttaaccceyyyyy-kinnnsss ~ .... I think I dressed WAY too fancy for your party ~ . But whatever ~ . Atleast it looks good ~ . x3 I couldn't find any light blue so I went with a dark blue and bostly black with the zippers/my < PROPFEMALE > / my headphones/ my collar being the silver ~ . I honesty think it fits what you wanted but I do also think I need a bit more blue on here somewhere ~ . xD 

I'm sooooo bored ... Anyone wana < PROPFEMALE > outs ~ ? 
I'm so bummed out ~ ! Today was a ton of fun playing Quidditch , but after all that , I'm sooo tired ... I think I'm going to pop into bed early ... or take a quick nap atleast ~ . 
MERRRRIII CHRISMASUUUU ~ !!!! x3 * licks everyone *

Just came back home roller blading from < PROPMALE>'s house ~ . Took a cold shower ... Mmm ... 
* Ish having fun with Lunar 2 * ( for the uninformed a PS1 game ) Thankies Nathan ~ . x3 
Okay Lunar 2 is starting to scare me ~ ! It has bits and pieces of things that exist in my real life ~ ! For example Kitty-Dragons ( mostly the white one I'm talking about ) ... HIRO is the main character ( talking about < PROPFIRST > here ) and plenty others that I'm noticing as I'm going through this game ... It's starting to become cool and creepy at the same time . 
HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE ~ !!! 
... Why am I useless in almost everything I do ? Why does everyone get angry at me when I screw up ? Oh yeah .... Because I'm an idiot and say that I can do everything , but can't do shit and ruin it for everyone else when they give me a < PROPMALE > to show it . * sigh * Please someone shoot me now .... 
It's official ... From this night on , I am now a furry . I don't give a shit what anyone else says about them , I love them ... especially their rave music <3 ~ . Seriously , the music is what truely turned me over , but if any of you have a problem with it , you all can just fuck off ~ . =3 
In a haze ... Drifting and oblivious to his surroundings ... I walk by and don't even notice myself ... Not feeling like doing anything , not feeling happy or sad .... I don't know if this is a bad thing in general , but it needs to stop ... I need to focus on studies and get work done for my company ... * sigh * What is wrong with me all of a sudden , nothing's bad happened to me , yet I feel so tired , and so ... depressed . 
Honestly , I don't know what's wrong with the way I talk or anything ... I've never played Gaia so I don't know how they talk ... Can't I just be the way I am with out being yelled at for once ~ ? x < Emotes and \~\" are just a habit in typing I have ... I just like putting expression into my words ... " 
Holy shit ~ ! It's 3:22 ~ ! What the fuck am I doing up so late ! I should be getting my shit packed and sleeping so I can book it over < PROPFEMALE>'s house today ! 
Cut my eyes out and make me bleed , so I can no longer see the vile blackness that consume my actions . Let the < PROPFEMALE > roses grow from the sockets and cling to the skin , rotten with beauty . Oh forever and ever , how I wish it were true , the sickening corpse that is you . 
When your father's being a whore and your mother's being a jerk , what do you do ~ ? YOU PUNCH THEM WITH YOUR BURNING FIST ~ !!! 
Welp ~ . There goes my computer , it finally called it quits ~ . I'm going to be a very sad man for a while , atleast until I get a new one of the same or better caliber ... Really , I can't find out what's wrong with the darn thing even when doing call that research ... 
Oh yes , I forgot to report someting .... Along with my computer's motherboard being completely destroyed as of today ( yesterday was slightly salvageable ) , I have also destroyed part of my left hand ( quite literally too ) and went to the ER . Good day everyone ~ . 
I really wish friends wouldn't bash on other friends ... They are starting to increase in < PROPFIRST > and spread quickly to bystanders like a plague ... 
So , I'm down at < PROPMALE > to do multimedia crap and I was thinking , since I'm already down here , it'd be nice to do something afterward with friends since- 
BAHHHHHHH ~ !!! I wana erase this expo-marker on my screen right now , but I can't ... I'm still using it ... God , I hate how you can't see shit when you use < PROPFEMALE > in Photoshop ...

Drinking hot coco in the summer with a black jacket , long black jeans , black gloves , and a black hat ... Man I'm weird ... 
So , it might be possible that we might be losing our dog , Pocky due to violent , abusive , and destructive behavior of my little brother ... * Sigh * I'm going to miss him very much ... 
Oh man I'm friggen sore from yesterday's party ~ . I haven't done that in a while , so I guess that would be understandable ... God , that just tells me how much I need to get out of the house ...

I typed up ' < PROPFEMALE > StoneKNIGHT ' subconsciously ~ ! Wow , I'm totally too conditioned to that word when it comes to anything that sounds medieval ... >.>; 
Ready , packed up , and leaving to Las Vegas for the wedding . See you all in around 2-3 days . 
... Okay I now understand what everyone is saying about me eating too little ... I've been surviving off of 2 slices of toast from 2 days ago that I had in the morning ... That is officially NOT healthy regardless of what anyone says ... 
Nothing better the listening to some good < PROPFIRST > wallbridge - chimera before a lecture ... I swear ... 
... Had a NICE talk with my uncle < PROPFIRST > ( Harvard/Stanford Graduate ) about my Business Law class and my future Company ... To put it simply , what my uncle told me to do , I need to stop being so god damn naive , lazy , and unorganized and get my ass into gear , become more efficient with my time , and fucking become 350% more social with my peers in Business . 
... Spent All of October dedicated to completing all the < PROPMALE > work I've skipped to study for business law ... Ends up I didn't even get 30 drawings done in my sketch book ( C grade ) , and my in class drawings = only 2 out of 7 complete ... spent the last 3 days lacking in sleep working on < PROPMALE > ... * sigh * Why can't I even get my hobbies done when I try super hard ... Wish me to survive , because luck no longer applies here ... 
You know God's with you when you're feverishly trying to finish late work and the music player plays theme music for 2 main characters of one of your favorite game then goes on to play a remix of all your other favorite character theme songs in a bundle from the same exact game , one right after the another . 
Cross my fingers ... Everything's going to be alright ... I'll keep telling that to myself till I get my results back ... I over-worked myself , and did the best I possibly could ... May god have mercy on me ... 
Mom's being a douche and dad's being lazy .... asked like 2 hours ago for a ride to OCC today for the film club ... they're watching nightmare before christmas 
Anyone still around the OCC campus ? I need to ask a favor ~ ! 
I learned something important in class today ... I depend on my reputation in life , more then anything . 
Going over to Las Vegas for Turkey weekend , guess I'll post something when I get there . Note : Doing this without a mouse on my desktop , cuz ' I'm pro with computer shortcuts . x3 
I thinks I'mma visit people at high school today . I hope teh security doesn't catch me , cuz I stick out like a sore thumb with my tail . It shall be a race , who shall find who first ?

Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross . They only want what everyone wants to be -accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you are faced with it . Let me add one thing they need to be accepted no matter WHAT AGE . 
I wish there was a like button on newgrounds for facebook , there's so many songs I want to \like\ " right now ... >.<;" 
\Kore wa Zombie Desu ka\ " just blew my mind ... =_= That's as ridiculous as anime gets ... I started at episode 3 and I think I had my fill of WTF-BOOM . " 
Here we go ... My second semester of college , I hope it goes 10x better then last semester . I swear , I feel like I'm getting old too fast with every day that passes ... It's not necessarily a bad thing , but I hope I don't become an adult too fast ... I want to enjoy my youth a bit longer . 
... I can't stand how irrational my mother is , she makes no sense then starts bad mouthing about me and my future then punishes me when I try to reason . 
... So my little brother was upstairs in his room right ? He calls my father for some cheese cake downstairs that my mom brought home from work ( YES with his cellphone and not yelling , lazy ass >.>;) . My dad responds by saying he ate all of it , causing my little brother to dashing down stairs to check ... The cheese cake was still intact and my father TRIES to make a quirky remark saying , \You got ' rick'!\ " ... "
