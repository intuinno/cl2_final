Money is just a symbol , it has no real value in nature . It is these imaginary systems we make such as economics , politics , ect . that tag somekind of value . Therefor , if their is a problem change the system to elimante the problem . Not throw the person in Jail , that solves nothing . Why do we keep doing the same thing over & over expecting a diffrent outcome ? 
who should goverment serve ? 
your belifes whatever they are , are meaningless when it comes to the nessesites of life . You want a world without war , poverty , suffering , ect .? then 1st you must declare all resources on earth as common heritage to all people . That is the only sustianable answer otherwise forget it ! it won't work ! 
everything begins with thought , if there's no thought then there would be no humanity , no animals , no trees , no nothing . 
I have no Heros , I have Hero moments in which someone says something that makes perfect sense . 
Is thinkiN , whatever to tha world .

you's a bitch you's a hoe here's a prom dress ! 
Are people really stupid enough to think that Iran's gonna attack us ? They'ed be DEAD the next fucking DAY ! 
Lets see how many nukes does Iran have on our borders ? Oh , that's right , Iran \ 
HAS NO NUKES in the Americas . How many nukes do we have on Iran's border ? 90 , not \

This is the significance of the number 13 in Illuminati symbolism . It has to do with Jesus & his disciples . There were 12 followers & then Jesus makes 13 . They truly believe they are superior beings , supermen , of the Aryan Race ( which Hitler wanted to \revive \") . Why do you think they allow books like the Da Vinci Code out ? It's all about emulating God . " 
Texas has 261,914 sq . < PROPMALE > of land . A family of 4 ( 2 parents & 2\ 
kids ) will be our example . We have about 7 billion people on Earth now . \ 
\ 
7,000,000,000 people / 4 = 1,750,000,000 families\ 
1,750,000,000 / 261,914 square < PROPMALE > of land = allowing every family to have about 1.5 square Acres of land each . \ 
All of which would fit on a land mass the size of Texas & we'd still have the rest of the world unoccupied .
