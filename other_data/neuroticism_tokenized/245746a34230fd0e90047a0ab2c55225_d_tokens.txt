If California and Massachusetts got in a fight , CA would throw sand but < PROPFEMALE > would bring out the outrageously large insects and redundant weather . It'd be over pretty fast .

< PROPFIRST > Mays has died . But wait ! There's more ! If you call now , for a limited time only , we'll tell you what the autopsy said for four easy payments of $19.95 !

Nobes runs into < PROPFEMALE > Fox's arms at a velocity of 8.0 m/s West . When < PROPFEMALE > Fox shoves him away from her , Nobes is traveling at 25.0 m/s East . Assuming the time < PROPFEMALE > Fox took to reject Nobes was 0.00000001 seconds , what is the amount of force she had to use ?

My professor just explained how farmers put modified \condoms\ " on ears of of corn to prevent too many plants from breeding with each other . I love college . " 
Today , my professor revealed that three girls had plagiarized an entire lab by photocopying someone else's work and putting their names on it . Really ? 
The Google Earth car drove up my street today while I was eating breakfast . I wanted to run outside and strike a ninja pose , but decided against being immortalized in just my boxers and a t-shirt .
