i'm in class having a discussion about childbirth . oh joy . 
when you're bored at work for hours these facebook apps become fun very fast . 
to go to class or not to go to class ? that's the question that students everywhere ask themselves constantly . and that's what i'm asking myself right now . 
hatetherain hatetherain hatetherain !!! =[ 
why is it that i literally am incapable of doing homework or writing papers until the day or the day before they're due . i don't understand . 
i am the least motivated person in the world right now . all i want to do is quit school and move to the other side of the world . unfortunately for me , the only way that's going to happen is if i do stay in school . so it is . 
you're in my blood like holy wine . you taste so bitter , and so sweet . oh , i could drink a case of you , darling , and i would still be on my feet . 
tired , but can't sleep . excited to go to antioch tomorrow . miss mexico . 
I'm fighting for something between apocalypse and liberation . 
Had a ticket for my train of thought , but I lost it . 
I take the beauty of chaos over ugly perfection . 
You assumed that I needed you , but you didn't realize that I needed no one but myself . 
so i got my letter of acceptance for the study abroad program next year . leaving for < PROPFEMALE > for 9 months on august 23rd !! =]

\I was in a store and I saw a pocket dictionary and that made me laugh because it’s such a specific item . I don’t know that many words and I’m going out and I have pants . Perfect ! ” " 
laying out by the pool , getting tan , listening to music on pandora , and reading an amazing book . summer's officially here . :) 
There's too many things I haven't done yet . Too many sunsets I haven't seen . 
I like parties , but I don’t like piñatas because the pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals . Hey , there’s a donkey with some pizzazz . Let’s kick its ass . 
S stands for filter . 
funny fungi . 
I like an escalator because an escalator can never break , it can only become stairs .

I care , but I'm restless . I'm here , but I'm really gone . I'm wrong and I'm sorry baby . And what it all comes down to is that everything's gonna be quite alright . 
i think i'm allergic to work . the past 2 days that i've been in the office i've been sneezing uncontrollably . and then when i leave , it stops . 
Stay the fuck away from that ficus . 
Here's to not liking things that under normal circumstances you really would like but would prefer to not have that many useless notifications . 
work never fails to bore me out of my mind . two more hours of this ? i might cry . 
people talk too much . 
Today was a good day . :)
