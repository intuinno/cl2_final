What does the future have instore ? All around me is turmoil , doubt , and fear . Maybe the advice an old friend gave me a few years ago should have been listened to . 

Mothers Day . I am grateful for the things that my mother did for me . I am grateful for the things my lovely bride does for my children and me . 
is feeling happy 
With all the problems that have happened lately , where are all the people who were complaining about < PROPFEMALE > ? Why didn't they speak up about the floods on the Missisippi ? Before you freak out and think I am some kind of racist wacko , just think for a moment . \ 
\ 
Where are the Hollywood celebrities holding telethons asking for help in restoring Iowa and helping the folks affected by the floods ? Where is < PROPFIRST > Moore ? 
Why isn't the Federal government moving Iowa people into free hotels in Chicago and Minneapolis ? \ 
When will Spike < PROPFIRST > say the Federal government blew up the levees that failed in Des Moines ? \ 
Where are all the looters stealing high-end tennis shoes , cases of beer and TV sets ? 
And in Iowa , where is the hysterical 24/7 media coverage reporting shootings at rescuers , of rapes and murder ? \ 
Where are all the people screaming that < PROPFIRST > Bush hates white , rural people ? \ 
Where are the government bail out vouchers ? The government debit cards ? 
It is on a need to know basis . 
If < PROPFIRST > W . Bush had created the positions for 32 or more Czars who report directly to him , bypassing the House and Senate on much of what is happening in < PROPFEMALE > , would you have approved ? \ 
If < PROPFIRST > W . Bush had made a joke at the expense of the Special Olympics , would you have approved ? 
Hey everyone ! I just bought another house without my spouse seeing it first ! I did send her about 50 pictures of it though ... she likes it in the pictures . 
Our President ? \ 
Obama to Skip Memorial Day at Arlington CemeteryTuesday , 25 May 2010 03:43 PM\ 
In a highly unusual move , President Barack Obama is going to skip the traditional Memorial Day event at Arlington National Cemetery to return home to Chicago for the long holiday weekend . 
Obama sees it as addressing one of the great broken promises of his administration : his early pledge to return home to Chicago every six weeks or so , according to The Washington Post . \ 
On Monday , Obama will make remarks at the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > National Cemetery and miss the usual tradition of presidents speaking at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day . 
Instead , Vice President Biden and his wife will appear in Obama's place , laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , as well as holding a breakfast for Gold < PROPFEMALE > families -- families whose loved ones died in military service -- at the White House earlier that day . \ 
This is an insult . 
The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > \ 
My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much \ 
government . \ 
No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government . \ 
The tree of < PROPFEMALE > must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . \ 
To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical . \ 
My son is off the USMC . This has been his vision for the past 5 years and both his mom and I support him completely . We arrived at his departure point , had our tearful farewells and off he went . I am proud of my son , and he has ancestry to look back upon who have endured the military and have come through . This Fathers day has been very special , and I can say with certainty that I will always remember this one . 
Wondering what my son is doing right now . 
So Long Connecticut . \ 
We came here in 1995 for my dream job . Working at Programmed Solutions . It was the best job I ever had working for a small company and watching it grow , being part of the growth . Those days are gone and miss them greatly . \ 
Watching our nest egg grow , our financial security improve . Then watch it all fall apart . 
Now we move back to where we came from , where the cost of living is much\ 
more affordable . Forty six percent ( 46%) less in fact . \ 
Will I miss CT ? Some of it but not most of it . \ 
The state is run by fools who tax & tax , spend more than they can \ 
raise with the tax increases and then tax more . \ 
History repeats itself as this was situation when we moved here . \ 
So Long . 
If Obama was the answer , it must have been a stupid question . 
All you who wanted ' everyone ' to have health care . Here is how those of us who have jobs are going to pay for it . \ 
Starting in 2011 your W2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of what ever health insurance you are given by the company . It doesn't matter if that's a private concern or governmental body . You're retired ? So what ; your gross will go up by the amount of insurance you get . 
Recieved a letter from < PROPFIRST > last night . He is well and doing well , apparently is being told by his DI's to \GO AWAY\ " . This is the best thing a DI can tell you according to < PROPFIRST > 
They were doing one of my most ' favorite ' excercises called squats , which really start to suck after about 20 , and each time he was about to finish his set , he was told to start over . After he restarted for the 3rd time (!) he finished , and his DI yelled for him to GO AWAY . He completed 200 squats ( my body went into spasms out of sympathy ) . \ 
more- 
He misses us , and he also misses < PROPFEMALE > . He is lonely for us , which was about the greatest thing he could have said . We are happy he got our letters , and I will write him a letter when I am done with work today . 
\We just have to pass the Healthcare < PROPMALE > to see what's in it . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Pelosi\ 
Bank of < PROPFEMALE > has a problem with downloading account information into financial applications such as Quicken for over 3 months . They also seem not to care how this is impacting their customers . You would think that in a period of 3 months a bank with thousands if not millions of customers would be able to resolve an issue like this . 
Square Foot Gardening . About to embark on growing food because of monetary & health concerns . Produce especially is expensive right here in the middle of corn country . Hot summers are going to make it interesting . Four of the 4 ' X 4 ' boxes which will grow many things in multiple crops . 
Made pancakes for the kids this morning . Made enough for everyone as < PROPFIRST > usually woke up after everyone else , never seemed to get any . So as I sat down I realized that < PROPFIRST > is not going to have pancakes with us this morning . I doubt that they would be edible if I sent them to Camp Geiger . Hope you had some pancakes this morning , and know that I am thinking of you . Even whilst making pancakes . 
Mislead by Bank of < PROPFEMALE > 
I am so tired of starry eyed morons who gush about Obama . They just do not get it . 
Since our president is going to give Eqypt to Osama Bin Laden , I am starting to think the 2012 end of the world may be accurate . Not only is Obama a moron , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is looking like a better president by the hour . 
I need a change for the better . I NEED it NOW . 
Why do professionals feel that they can go into auto-pilot when they provide services , and if their incompentence causes an issue you shouldn't be angry ? 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Fike ! 
< PROPMALE > Hewitt corporate is taking action with the clown who screwed up my taxes . 
I have read that Obama has declared the Defense of Marriage laws unconstitutional . He instructed the Atty General not to enforce this . So how does he think that he is in a position to do this ? Apparently he thinks he is all 3 branches of government . 
I miss my son . We have been speaking on the phone alot lately . When his MEU sails he may be away for almost a year .
