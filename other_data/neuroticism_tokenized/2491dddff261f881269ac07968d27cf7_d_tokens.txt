How do you become a fossil ? Step One : DIE . 
is mad at facebook because she keeps trying to upload pictures from West < PROPFEMALE > but it just says \unexpected error\ " . hmpf . " 
had a very pleasant day . tomorrow it's off to Eagle Lake for the day . 
I don't recall a single care , just greenery and humid air , then Labor Day came and went , and we shed what was left of our summer skin .

NO ! my head is WORTHWHILE ! plus I had an amazing time last night . one of my favorite nights ever !

is thankful that her father's first ride in an ambulence ended in him being okay . 
probably ...

No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
would like to thank Gabe for taking her to her first ND game . It was a great game and a wonderful time . :) 
has become more obssesed with football . screaming at the tv and kicking and hitting people isn't the best solution . but thank goodness ND won . at least one of my teams won . poor IU and no clue what happened with PSU . 
finds it funny that someone tried to steal cheesecakes from one of her customers , thankfully they were caught . Also , she got a recruitment letter from Manchester College for sports . What sport am I playing ? I certainly haven't been practicing . 
knows that everyone poops . 
is being recycled . In a good way . :) 
if they always end sad then they never end happy . it's so disappointing ! :) 
< PROPFIRST > and gabe are like cat dog . 
loves playing never have I ever and cast parties never fail to make her happier . :)

thinks that most people don't know what it's like to go down an ice covered hill at 2 A.M. 
white . like the snow outside . and my skin . 
* insert Mr. Sauer whale sound * 
< PROPFEMALE > Kachmarik took the damn middle .

' s brother is a root beer connoisseur . 
kinda wishes that she were down at Grissom racing the car with < PROPFIRST > Loring and all of the other racing people down there this weekend , but wishes them all good luck . :) 
is lacking 4 wisdom teeth , 2 of which are in a little baggie . 
thinks that using a fully < PROPMALE > film camera is kinda like driving a stick shift . You can do just about whatever you want and it's way cooler and a little more difficult . 
isn't sure if it is worse that she freaked out thinking that there was a person in her house and it turned out to be the cat , or that the cat is so fat that it sounded like a person walking on the wood floors . 
is hoping for < PROPFIRST > Loring to come back with a Sports Car was Wrong t-shirt . :) And she's pretty pumped for the Vampire Weekend concert tonight ! :) 
congrats Daddy ( < PROPFIRST > Loring ) for your third place finish at nationals , good think you didn't get those rain tires ! :)

just remembered that there were baby carrots in her fridge . they will be nearly gone soon . 
I like it on the floor . 
thinks it's sad that even the duct tape company doesn't know how to spell duct . There is no reason to have DUCK tape . Why would I tape a duck ? That'd be mean . 
is a straight ally and today is National Coming Out Day . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and only five states plus DC recognize that love , not gender , is what matters in a marriage .

has realized that what she will miss about high school in college is the lack of snow days . 
is bragging that she got her taxes done because TurboTax told her to . :)

< PROPFEMALE > . ;) 
is constantly amazed by < PROPFEMALE > Chen's amazingness and how she managed this without having her brain implode ( on parade ) . Congrats ! You deserve this more than anyone , like ever . :) 
is in Bloomington all week with < PROPFIRST > Kennedy , Gabe Hardy , < PROPFEMALE > Mammolenti , < PROPFEMALE > Whitaker , and Jordin Perkins . Silly < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Hickman can't do anything cause his days are all planned out . 
you find things in the last place you look , except when you don't find them . 
you know you are past tired when you start writing about how Hamlet somersaults down the hill of tragedy . 
can't believe the time I've spent here and how it is nearly over . 
is keeping her graduation cap on her desk to remind her that it's almost done and to just finish it off .
