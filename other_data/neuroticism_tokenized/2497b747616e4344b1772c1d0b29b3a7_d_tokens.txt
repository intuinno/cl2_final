I think taking advantage of a grown man wearing mittens is the moral equilavent of sucker punching an old , blind lady . 

Only 3 more days until the hospital tour ... can't wait to see those severed limbs and the fetus in a jar ! EWWWW !!! 
Two more days ' til I go down < PROPFEMALE > morgue ! 
Snow day , Snow day , Snow day !!! 
Holy crap , I think my computer has tourettes !! 
I finally got done with all my homework ! Did it take anyone else 3 hours to wrap their mind around solving quadratic functions ?!?! Please tell me yes ... 
The Kids in the Hall : Death Comes to Town is on in 2 hours !!!!! This going to be amazing !!!! 
Could I have possibly have been anymore of an ass ?! 
hospital practice interviews Monday ... kill me X_X 
had fun with < PROPFEMALE > at the mall . People watching/stalking is hilarious ! 
Holy Crap , does EVERYBODY come on here at 9 o'clock ? 
Death Comes to Town is on again tonight ! Yeah , Kids in the Hall ! 
Wow , did I seriously just play bubbleshooter for an hour and a half ? 
I get to sleep in tomorrow , AND it's Animal Farm Friday ? Wow , dreams do come true ! 
What is on my mind ? Good question , Facebook ! 
\This calls for a very special blend of psychology and extreme violence ! \ " -Vyvyan " 
\Only the cool kids go to Tilt\ " lmao . " 
Life is full of mysteries . One of them being , how exactly did my brother learn the lyrics to Wannabe by the Spice Girls ???? 
Ugh , I finished my school homework , but now I have 3 journals to do and a test to study for . FML ... 
I can't tell you how many times word banks have saved my life . 
Wow , the < PROPFEMALE > looks amazing tonight ... 
Why am I getting friend requests from people who would never talk to me in person ? Well , nature of the beast I suppose . 
My eyes are burning !! 
Where's the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch when you need it ? \One ... Two ... Five ! \"" 
AH ! Why do I have the chorus to \Buffalo Stance\ " stuck in my head ?!?! " 
I hate getting college pamphlets from places I don't have a < PROPMALE > in hell of going ! 
is nervous about HOSA :P 
< PROPFIRST > Orwell's moustache makes me giggle . Teehee . 
Chyeah ! Ghostbusters is on ! 
is listening to Third Eye Blind . Every song I play brings back memories . Don't quite know if that's good or bad . 
I'd do anything right now to be able to lay in the grass on a warm , < PROPFEMALE > day ... 
I just built a lego castle with a drawbridge ... this is going to be a long weekend :P 
[ Insert relevent song lyric here ] 
Does anybody else have that fantasy where they're screaming karyoke of \Leaving On A Jet Plane\ " with their arm wrapped around their best friend ? No ? Ok ... me neither ... " 
soy < PROPFEMALE > perdedor 
But puzzled so it makes you sick . Your diary's looking like the Bible , with its verses lost in time . Lost in meaning to the people who surround you , it's a crying shame , you know it's a crying shame . 
Just got my glasses . I can see better , but it feels like I stepped into the 8th demention . Weird . 
There must be someone out there who hates Bon Jovie and Journey as much as I do . There just has to be ! 
\They're giving us a much safer nation ! Their eerie lack of skin pigmentation is filling bad guys up with remorse ... IT'S THE PALE FORCE !! \"" 
Antique browsing with Monka tomorrow ? Oh , hell yeah ! 
I heard somebody as the word \skeeze\ " today for the first time in years . That made my day :D " 
Stomach ... cramping ... must ... curl up in a ball ... death near ... noooooo 
Isn't it depressing to know that all of this amazing weather will go down the drain this weekend ? 
Today I went on a 1960's french movie binge that ended with me cutting my own bangs in the bathroom to look like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s . So , I'd say my day was pretty average . 
After 11 hours of feeling nothing but embarassment , I'm finding it really hard to feel anything anymore . I don't know why people need to use their superiority to purposly make you feel like a piece of trash . Great job ! I'm sure you feel a whole lot better about yourself now ! 
Get out of my head < PROPFIRST > Bowie . I mean it this time . 
SVEN LIVES !! :D :D :D 
\And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket ? Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket ? \ " -CAKE " 
\I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Campbell " 
I hate it when I like a song , then I find out it's about something horrible . Now I feel like a jerk . Thanks a lot Boomtown Rats :( 
\Cocaine is like really evil coffee . \"" 
is feeling like Riff < PROPMALE > today . If only the Ramones would pop by and sing songs to me . 
I'm probably the most confused I've ever been . I should be sad , but I'm not . I should be listening to The Smiths , but I'm not . Instead I keep playing 12:51 by the Strokes . Emotions are weird . 
What happened to bands like The < PROPFEMALE > Underground ? I might like society more if there were more like them . :P 
... nothing feels right . 
Topic for Research Paper : Check . Kick Ass Essay Grade : Accomplished . No Homework . Wow . Now , I have nothing to do but wait for that < PROPFIRST > McVeigh documentary ... my life is boring :P 
Keeper of the Carts ! Chief of Concessions ! Dispenser of Coins ! 
My head head is throbbing and I'm irritated . Why is it only Wednesday ?!?! 
? These are the Daves I know , I know/ These are the Daves I know ? 
I'm scared . I hate the dentist . 
I was this close to buying a dress today , but I chickened out . I make a horrible girl . >.< 
Dear < PROPFIRST > Mcrea , Please take off your hat . I know you think it's cool , and you've had a hat during every performance , video , and interview since ' 93 , but I really need to know if you have hair . Best Regards , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm so ridiculously over this stupid heat rash ! It stings and keeps bleeding when I bend my arm . Arghh !! 
\I know you ! You're Karim < PROPMALE > Jabbar !... \"" 
had fun acting out < PROPMALE > Python skits in English ... instead of doing my research paper . Whoops . 
I'm so excited for tomorrow it's not even funny ! I've needed a \svix\ " for a while now . " 
Now I'm sick , just in time for the weekend . How wonderful . >.< 
I'm really sick of waiting around for stuff to come along . You don't know how happy I'd be if next month a band comes along that makes me want to listen to the radio . Music revolution anyone ? 
I did my report ! SUCCESS !!! 
Sven spotting ! State street ! Winter coat !! Wtf ?!?! < PROPFEMALE > , you are my hero . 
It's bothering me that I still don't know who yelled my name in the parking lot yesterday :P 
Why won't something , no , anything , happen ? 
I don't care . I ? Oasis . 
I quite enjoyed my hour as an artist's model . I do believe I have found my calling . 
I have central heterochromia . You learn something new everyday . 
Gross ! I got a sunburn on my oven burn ... this means like 2x the peeling . 
I love you , AwkwardFamilyPhotos.com 
\Life is simple . It's just not easy . \"" 
Today . Was . Amazing . :D 
Well ... this didn't turn out how I wanted it to . But the X-Files is on and I have something to look forward to . Oh , and I'm now a senior ... I guess that's ok . 
I feel amazingly ridiculously happy about everything and everyone !! :D 
Why can't the new CAKE cd come out nnnoooowwww !!! 
So far , I am really really really looking forward to Wednesday ... and Saturday . :D 
All I can say is I'm sorry . 
I am relieved about a million different things right now . I did my job , now I'm just happy . 
Yes , < PROPFIRST>'s coming over to play board games with me ! I hope he's aware I'm a battleship champion . Then again , I want to see his face when I win . 
Well I've got absolutely nothing to do for the next week . Yay , boredom has come to visit me again . 
lonely 
Woah ! I'm a darker shade of pale right now . Right on . 
I miss you . Come back home ! Who am I supposed to make an epicenter with ?! 
Someday I'm going to have a < PROPMALE > Hanks movie marathon . Man , I love the movie \Big \"." 
I've come to the conclusion that Sunday will never get here . I hate waiting ! 
I had so much fun on my first boat trip yesterday . Even though we hit a wake and my spine is killing me . But I'm not paralyzed , so it's all good . Now I'm going up north . Hizzah ! 
[ insert status update here ] 
I hate having to redye my hair . My scalp ! It burrrnnss just thinking about it !! 
How can you possibly be this hard to say goodbye to , even though I know I'll see you again ? My brain hurts . Everything hurts . 
How come this week I've heard the song \modern love\ " by < PROPFIRST > Bowie everytime I turn on my radio ?! " 
I hate how this day hasn't been going right 
Toy Story 3 was pretty damn deep and dark for a kid's movie . I think I just had some sort of life crisis by watching it . I wanted to bawl my eyes out . 
Must fight the urge to listen to cheesy , early Depeche Mode songs . Must . Fight . Aw , nevermind . I can't deny < PROPMALE > Gahan and his leather trousers :) 
had fun playing LAIRE with < PROPFIRST > in his backyard last night :D Twas Amaaazing !! 
I can't dive to the bottom of a pool for the life of me . I'm only kind of ashamed of this fact . I mean it's not a life skill ... right ? RIGHT ?! 
My head hurts and my sunburn is killing me . Eh , could be worse . 
I'm trying very hard to embrace my natural hair texture . If only I could figure out how to manage the damned wavy-ness ! Raahhh ! 
It's always odd when somebody said that you were in a dream of their's , especially when you acted like a jerk :P 
I ? Houghton MI 
The perfect TLC show would be the story of two midgets who have a lavished wedding , then a year later find out that they are pregnant with octuplets . Eh , I'd watch it . 
Only a few more days . I think I can stand it , but I'm not so sure anymore :/ 
I think my thigh is becoming immune to my phone vibrating . Uh oh . 
Hi , I'm < PROPFEMALE > . I'm a birth survivor . 
There's no greater feeling on earth than to look up at the stars with somebody you care about and talk until 5 in the morning about anything that comes to mind :) 
Had fun at Standish , but I think I left most of my stuff in the camper . Uh oh . 
Dear god I'm amazing at guesstures . Take that < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > !!! VICTORY !!! 
Two dumb things people do on facebook : 1 ) posting their phone < PROPFIRST > in conversations on people's walls . I swear to god I will prank phone call all of you one day . And 2 ) being underage and posting pictures with beer cans in your hands with the label oh so proudly displayed . People are a trip . AH !! 
Waiting ... waiting ... still waiting ... AHH !! 
HOT TUB TIME MACHINE !!! LOUGLE !!! < PROPFIRST > CUSACK !!! AHHH !!! 
I just realized he's my own personal < PROPMALE > Dobler ? 
who has 2 thumbs and is dating someone who turns up \Girl's Just Wanna Have Fun\ " when it comes on the car radio and bounces around in his seat ?... ME !! ??? " 
Oh-no it's that time of year again when my friends go to band camp for a week and I'm all alone :( 
Yes !!! They're starting to play Freaks and Geeks on IFC . There is a God :D 
I quite enjoy \good night\ " text messages :) " 
Nothing like observing people at the mall to make you lose any and all faith in humanity . Good job society :) 
Enjoyed surprising her friends at band camp . Twas a gift only money can buy ! ( seriously , there's a meet-and-greet fee of $10 ( plus a 200% sales tax ) , check and money orders are accepted ) . PAY UP PEOPLE !!!... Yes that means you !!! 
It's just a Smiths kind of day today 
\I hate the stars because I look at the same ones you do 
I don't know why I keep watching \The Painted Veil\ " . The story never changes and I cry just as hard every time . How terribly depressing . " 
I need to see Dinner for Schmucks . Rudd , < PROPMALE > , Carrell , and Galifianakis ?! Tis ' a dream team ! 
It feels like 2 months going on 3 years ... and I mean that in the best possible way :D 
Hey , Mr. < PROPFEMALE > Recruiter do you mind not calling me at 8 in the morning . Thank you ! 
RIP Spazzy the Fish ... RIP 
I had a dream last night that I was one of the people in the auditorium at the end of the movie < PROPFEMALE > . I now have a reason not to go to prom . 
Camping this weekend :) 
Getting my senior pictures tomorrow . I don't think I've felt this terrified in a long time . Oh no ! 
I'm ready for fall weather . Ahhh sweaters :) 
School , oh how I hate thee this trimester :( 
Is it Friday yet ? 
Holy crap , my head is pounding :( \ 
It's funny how things can change for the absolute worse in a matter of hours . 
I love using word associations when studying :) 
I need hot soup and some cold medicine on a day like this :( 
My \romantic\ " dinner of ravioli and apple juice was just ruined by < PROPFIRST>'s cat pooping in the other room ... YAY FOR KITTIES !!!!! " 
God I feel so invisible right now , this is a wonderful start to the week . 
\They're over the < PROPFEMALE > when I < PROPMALE > pantaloons\ " \ 
Can't wait to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow :) 
I got everything I need for homecoming with the ever so wonderful < PROPFEMALE > today . Now all I have to do is sit back and relax . \ 
:) 
< PROPFIRST>'s hoodies will always seem warmer and more comfortable than any of mine ever will . This fact saddens me . 
Jealousy is rearing its head , and I can't help it . I hate when life is like this ! 
I have to dye my hair again . Oh what joy . I love it when my scalp feels itchy for 20 minutes :P 
Oh sheesh ya'll . Twas a dream . 
Gah , I lost my cool card ! Again !! \ 
:( 
Homecoming tomorrow . I'm nervous , but excited . Hopefully , all goes well . 
Slow dances are nice . 
\You're gonna wake up in a smoothie ! \"" 
Some members of the female sex annoy me and I believe they always will . 
Oh of course you text back whenever I leave the room :P 
I hate when you look in the mirror and realize , once and for all , that you may be in the running for the palest being on earth . 
Halloween Halloween Halloween :D 
Gots me a date today :) \ 
Tis long overdue may I say . 
Stupid brain , stop thinking ! 
I wish I knew how to ice skate 
I have a ridiculously strong craving for popcorn flavored jelly beans . I don't know how to feel about his :/ 
Flailing my arms around madly to the backstreet boys was not exactly how I planned to spend my Wednesday night . 
All of this feels so surreal . I can't think right now . I feel sick to my stomach and shocked . 
\Cause they'll market this song to you impressionable and insecure teenage girls/'Cause all they gotta do is find a sexually attractive man that can sing all the words \"--- pop song :) " 
Got my SVSU acceptance letter . Yay :) 
I want < PROPFIRST > Bowie for Christmas ... and boots . 
I totally forgot how much I loved Clueless until now :) 
Girls at the mall all look the same :P 
Stag weekend for me :( 
I only want to be < PROPFIRST > Nicks . Is that too much to ask for ? 
Sledding :) 
Crisis averted :) 
This week < PROPFIRST > finally realized that guy from the sandlot was blind ... and black , I got lost in the Sears in Saginaw , and I conquered my apprehension toward escalators . I feel accomplished :)
