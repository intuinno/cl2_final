To all who has seen the car pictures , that car died about a week ago ; engine trouble(computer crap ) , we fix it twice but it still died out on us . We took it back and got our money back . 

I recomend that you should drive before you buy . 
But I maybe looking at 1950 chev deluxe , pictures maybe on the way . 
Anybody hear any interesting new lately ?

To anyboby who reads this , I am still in Arkanas , but I maybe returning on the first week of Aug . and I want to ask if anyone wants to go for a soda when I get back . Call or text me at 469-525-5201 and tell me when you are avilable or not ; I'd prefer a text so you can write down your phone < PROPFIRST > , if this sounds good to you please let me know .
