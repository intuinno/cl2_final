ANOTHER amazing day ! :D Except < PROPFIRST > like owned me and Brawl and then at Kerplunk . -_- 
Doesn't feel very good . ): 
:/ 
I'm tired . =P 
Is it possible to , y'know , DIE from boredom ? 
I'm . So . Bored . 
THERE'S NOTHING ON TV ! 
I just touched my sister's sunburn , and it turned WHITE for like TWO MINUTES ! But she kidna started screaming ... x.x 
Physics . 
isn't in the best mood . 
Done with physics games . Gonna go watch Tv . 
I was watching Saved By the < PROPFEMALE > , and there were two bars of music written on the chalkboard behind the characters , so instead of listening to what they were saying , I was singing the music . =D Is that too nerdy ? 
Goodness gracious ! Physics games ! 
You rein , your rein . < PROPFEMALE > in the highest , you rein . 
mellophone sectionals ? Aye or nay ? ( None of the section leaders are gonna be there this week ) 
\It is the Lord who goes before you . He will be with you ; he will not fail you or forsake you . Do not fear or be dismayed . \ " ( Deuteronomy 31:8 ) " 
is most definitely a boredom eater . 
My arm hurts ... And my phone sucks . 
Frustrated . 
worries too much . 
(: much better . 
Gets to be with him today . :D 
I figured out a way to get my mind off things : Do math problems in my head . =D 
I think along with the ' Become a Fan ' thing , there should also be a ' I Hate This ' button . Or a ' Kill a Fan ' button . (: 
' s air conditioner stopped working . Ughhh . 
Everyone knows women always have the last say in an arguement . What a man says after that is the beginning to a new arguement . 
It's hot . And I'm bored . 
If I didn't love him so much , I would've killed him by now . 
It's . So ... Hot . 
So , my left arm hurts like really bad ... And the left side of my chest hurts a little too ... Ugh . 
Amazing time with < PROPFIRST > and his family . (: Golfing isn't as easy as it looks . 
The Lord will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem ; the earth and the sky will tremble . But the Lord will be a refuge for his people , a stronghold for the people of < PROPMALE > . -- < PROPFIRST > 3:16 
Come to me , all you who are weary and burdened , and I will give you rest . Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls . For my yoke is easy and my burden is light . ( < PROPFIRST > 11 : 28-31 ) 
Bored until around 6 . 
Happier than I've been in a long time . (: We were both young when I first saw you ... :D 
is a < PROPMALE > more than slightly frustrated . :P 
My pinky's still swollen ! :O Bad pinky ! 
wonders if there is a koobecaf.com ... To make people who read backwards go to that site instead of facebook ... hmmmm . 
And if all my dreams come true , I'll be spendin ' time with you ! Oh , I love you more today than yesterday . But not as much , as tomorrow ! ( I just neraly burned my < PROPMALE > noodles ! ) 
is very impatient . 
Love , love , love . All you need is love . (: 
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand ' cause Band-Aid's stuck on me ! ( Nothing to do ALL day . ) 
< PROPMALE > Turner : Hey guys , what's new ? ; [ Cosmo lights candles under water ] ; Wanda : The laws of physics . 
Boring day . 
Yay for MMOs . (: 
Bored . 
Ready for father's day to be over . 
Charge your phone . -_- 
Ughh . 
Missing him crazy ... and his phone's dead ... I think . 
Frustrated isn't the word for it . 
Ffdjaskf . 
We have a NEW kind of relationship . xD ABC Family is gonna get shot in the face . 
I've fallen and I can't get up ! 
\Good morning world and all who inhabit it ! AHHHH ! \ " - Sponge < PROPMALE >." 
I had a dream I was an airforce bomber ... O.o 
Plans for tonight canceled . ): 
Not a wonderful day at the least . Probably to < PROPFEMALE > Garden when the folks get home . 
So .. I was eating some calamari and something popped into my head : Why is Squidward and octopus ?! 
I hate this feeling . 
It's . So . Early . I hate sectionals ... Ugh . Hanging with < PROPFIRST > this afternoon , though . (: 
Burned my face . Stupid sun ! Going with < PROPFIRST > later . (: 
I can't decide if I'm more mad then I am worried , or more worried than I am mad . 
So , I overreacted ... For like the millionth time ever . Oops . xD 
high-fives < PROPFIRST > Jennings . 
So , I now officially love how bi-polar Texas weather is ! It's like , cool and rainy , and it was 103 degrees less than an hour ago . I love the rain . 
Sleepeh . May crash early tonight . 
Nothing is more powerful than my God . 
Fiesta Texas this weekend . :D 
I had an amazing time , but now I'm a little frustrated . 
just realized something : I can type heck-a fast . 
So I'm not leaving till 8:30 tomorrow night ! I get to sleep then entire way ! :D 
Ugh . 
Is probably gonna end up not being able to sleep tonight . 
is actually not stressed out today . (: To Fiesta Texas tonight ! 
By His light I walked through darkness . ( Job 29:3 ) 
Now I'm a little stressed . But not too much . Preparing for a challenging week and weekend . Especially weekend . 
is hungry , and has had a long day . :P 
about to leave to drop the girls off , then coming home to finish packing , and then leaving for San < PROPFIRST > . 
Why is it I always do things slower when I'm in a hurry ? 
Leaving soon ... My phone won't work when I get to San < PROPFIRST > , but I have a different phone I'll call people on . Talk to ya'll Monday . 
is shaking . 
should've never checked facebook . 
My head hurts . -_- 
is updating ... I'm so bored . 
wants a phone I can check my Facebook on . -_- 
Can't remember the last time I've been so worried . 
And if we just keep digging we can reach the foundation of our souls . 
is just here . 
Why can't anything ever go as planned ? :P 
Today sucks . 
La-de-day . 
Parents turn the internet off at 10 . :P La-de-day . 
-_-

Ah , screw it . Stupid video . :P ' Night everybody .

Remember when I said I loved being happy ? Well , I hate being upset more than I love being happy . 
Wants to know why I can never sleep in . 
My cat just bit me . :P 
Is completely blah . 
This is not a good early birthday present . ): 
Was born exactly sixteen years , three hours , and thirty eight minutes ago . 
I want some freaking jolly ranchers .... Mixed with sour gummy worms .... And some starburst ! OHOHOH , and a big , humongous double chocolatey chip frappacino from Starbucks ... 
Got a new phone . With Bluetooth ! :D It's amazing .

:P 
Loves Baseball . :O 
Has band tomorrow . And has eaten WAY too much pizza . ): 
Is enjoying band camp . (: Lovelovelove it . Evening block @ Penningtonnnn . :D 
Thank goodness of doctor appointments and step-dads . 
Mello party tonight . :D And is in a really good mood ... Odd . xD 
:/ Yaaayy . 
Has anyone ever noticed that all popcorn bags say to NOT use the popcorn button on the microwave , but all mcrowaves have the popcorn button ? 
Thinks SOMEONE should get home from football already . :P Anddd , I'm too lazy to check the website : Brass sectionals tomorrow ? 
Doesn't get on Facebook much . :P And slept through three outta five classes today . (: 
Whoohooo ! Straight A's , babbby . Even if I do doze off sometimes . :D 
Everybody has/wants a waterbuffalo ... ( I'm not sure which one it is . :P ) 
Everybody's GOT a waterbuffalo ! :D 
Facebook needs to stop telling me I'm amazing . :P It's starting to get a bit uncomfortable . 
I can't decide on a profile picture . :P

Cut her hair ! :D 
is not gonna be able to sleep . 
I don't know how to change my language back to NORMAL English ! D: Ugh . 
Nevermind . (: 
Would like to announce the band was completely energy-less at the parade . That was an illusion . (: 
Shower , then < PROPFIRST > , then sleep . YAY ! :D 
Didn't feel good , so got to go home early . 
The reason firehouses have circular stairways is from the days of yore when the engines were pulled by horses . The horses were stabled on the ground floor and figured out how to walk up straight staircases . 
My day totally just started sucking . BAD . 
I didn't have any homework . :O It's amazing ! 
:P ' Tis all . 
That wasn't all . I lied . :P JUST KIDDING . It actually was all . :D ( I'm really , REALLY bored . ) 
< PROPFIRST > changed my language back to regular English . :P PIRATE ALL THE WAY ! (: 
Can't wait for Indy ! :D I'm so freaking EXCITEDD . 
Was in love with The Woodlands ' show this year . (: 
Vids from the bus trip back on youtube . (: 
Right Here Waiting -- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > . Me and < PROPFIRST>'s song . (: I freakin ' love it . 
Goodbye L . D . < PROPFEMALE > . ): 
is sleepy . 
When did Youtube get advertisements in the middle of the playlist ?! The world is gonna ESPLODE . :O 
Misses her friends . ): Already ! D: IANNN ! JENNAE ! )) : 
Love is a fire . But whether it is going to warm your heart or burn down your house , you can never tell . - < PROPFIRST > Crawford 
Why on Earth would you have a football game at 11 a.m. ? :O 
Going to < PROPFIRST>'s football game today ... At ELEVEN in the morning . You would think that all the football players would be falling over because their too tired to play . :P But I'm excited , nonetheless ... Long post . :D 
Football game was funn . It was freaking INTENSE . No , you know what it was , frizzing LEGIT . ;D 
VERY good day . (: Fo sho . 
It's . Really . Hot . Ugh . 
If you swim across the Rio Grande to the United States , but have a legal passport and all the paperwork and crap you need in a waterproof bag , is it still illegal ? 
My boyfriend's in the Air Force . What is yours doing ? Working at Wal-mart ? (; 
First day of new school . :P Yuck . I went from a Blue Raider to a Fighting Farmer . 
LHS is HUGE ! But the band kids all loved me , and were really nice . :D 
Is at < PROPFIRST>'s house . (: 
I dare you to close your eyes a moment ; think about everything you possibly can , bother yourself until you're almost to tears , and then scream out for God . 
Solos suck ... Concerto No . 3 in e flat whatever is even worse than a regular solo . :P 
I got < PROPFIRST>'s Christmas gift . (: Finally . 
I'd really like to know why I've started liking country since I started dating < PROPFIRST > ... :P 
< PROPFIRST>'s family got me a Rascal Flatts CD for Christmas ... And I can't stop listening to it . (: 
Naps with my love are wonderful . (: Getting all the time I can before he leaves Tuesday . 
2nd band , babeeeh . (: I've gotten pretty dang good now that I don't have the pressure of L . D . < PROPFEMALE > on my shoulders . 
OHOHOH . 2nd band , for one . (: Anddd awesome-tastic Air Force informative meeting on Wednesday . :D Yaaaaaayyyyyy MILITARY ! :D And another thing ... I might be at < PROPFEMALE > around 4 Thursday , guys . (: 
So , yesterday was the most interesting day of my life . Like , seriously . 
If < PROPFEMALE > doesn't stop playing her oboe I'm going to burn it . And by burn it , I mean put it in a barrel of C4 and then light the barrel on fire ... and then whatever is left of it , I'm going to shoot with an M16 . By the way . 
I hate when teenagers tell their parents they don't know what it's like , or it's different from when they were teenagers . Maybe the situations were somewhat different , but their feelings weren't . And for the most part , your grandparents were more strict on your parents than your parents are on you . And ' hating ' them doesn't help . Respect your elders ; they know more than you do . 
Obama is about to give a speech about how great the State of the Union is . With our economy , crime , war , and his approval rate dropping , I have to wish our president the best of luck . So , even as a Republican , best of luck Mr. President . 
\I'm Still A Guy\ " is definitely mine and < PROPFIRST>'s song . Go look it up . (: < PROPMALE > Paisley . " 
\I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination . Imagination is more important than knowledge . Knowledge is limited . Imagination encircles the world . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Einstein " 
Don't tell me there is no God . If there is no God , where does emotion sprout from ? Many would try to argue it is birthed from the brain ; a stimulus of electrodes connecting and disconnecting .. But , had there not been a God to give us these brain cells , what would we have ? How does such evolve from nothingness ? 
Heeeey L . D . Bellies : Will y'all let me know if y'all have President's Day , the 15th , off ? 
I was going to think of something witty and completely aphorism-like to say ... But I'm lazy and it's Saturday . So , enjoy y'allselves! xD 
\I can't wait till I'm old . Then I can have an old guy in my life . :) \ " - < PROPFEMALE >." 
I know I'm supposed to be a Christian and pray for the people I don't like , but it's really difficult when I have to watch some arrogant teenager tell a teacher , who had recently had a loved one die , that they enjoy seeing her mess up . That happened Tuesday . 
I was on CBS 11 News at 4 ! :D So now all of North Texas knows \We're not a healthy family ; we don't eat carrots . \ " (: " 
Iiiiii had a good day . (: And my hair's short ! And I love Joeyyyy . 
I want to become a fan of \I hate it when my band director blames only me for doing everything wrong . \ " :P " 
It's interesting to me how people can assume hatred on sight . Many humans of sound mind would look at someone else , and would find nothing but the differences from themselves How they could simply show hostility because the other being has different colored skin , religion , or ideals seems , to me , the reason this world is falling into a battlefield of doubt and a pool of hopelessness . -- Me , of course . (: 
Solo and ensemble today . I'm gonna fail . :P 
It is hard to fall into true love , especially after heartbreak and mistreatement from male relatives , but when one does , no matter the doubts or the difficulty , it will last forever . Happy 3 days till Half-Year Anniversary , < PROPFIRST > , dear . (: 
You got me hooked on country , you got me hooked on trying to be a better person , you got me hooked on cowboy boots and trucks , and , more importantly , you got me hooked on you . (: 
Date with < PROPFIRST > tomorrow evening . (: I'm excited . 
Happy Half-Year , Darlin ' . (: 
And I miss you again . 
I can't wait till the Saturday before Spring Break is over . (: Doesn't that sound weird ? 
I love the way you < PROPMALE > me when I run away from you , and pick up up and put me over your shoulder and < PROPFEMALE > me back so I can't run away anymore . And I love how when I tell you to leave , you just stare into my eyes and hold me closer . I love you , < PROPFIRST > dear . (: 
It's Spring Break . And I wake up at eight o'clock . 
I don't think I could ever live without you ; I miss you after just one day of being apart . 
I just realized I hate motorcycles . I used to just dislike them for personal reasons , but now , it is pure hatred . Why ? They are heavy , and in no way should one try to push them into a garage without any knowledge of the vehicle . Also , do not ever attempt if you have a family that does not work out alot , and the oldest daughter's boyfriend is in Tennessee . 
I used to love band . I used to look forward to band . I used to wake up in the morning for band practice and not completely hate it . Now , I find band an annoyance . A simple part of my life that seems to me like an unnessesary hobby that I truely do not care for . And , honestly , I find those who obsess over band like I once did obnoxious ; unknowing of the world of having a life , unless their band is worth being so . 
Wednesday will be an amazing day . 
Ten bottles of water before 10 o'clock . xD We're a betting couple . 
Three more to go . Ugh . 
Found out that you can actually die from drinking too much water . I was a gallon away . xD 
He's coming back today ! :DDD 
I have finally figured out why more women than men seem to be ambidextrous : Women have to paint their fingernail on both hands . 
I really want to watch Titanic right now . :/ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWrMeBR8W-c 
< PROPFIRST > Jennings and her family are the < PROPFEMALE>'s knees . :D 
If I went to Pennington field right now , I could probably remarch the entire show from this year because of my memory . But that's not my realization . My realization is that I actually COULDN'T do this , because marching season over = lack of excersize . 
I burned my fingers on a glue glun , and it hurt like nothing else . :P I couldn't even sleep . It was great . 
http://www.wimpyourself.com/?w=903c3f3160b38398e5519e78d 
< PROPFEMALE > kicked me in the face . It was awesome . :P 
Oh no . My sister's becomming a teenager , and I'm getting out of that rediculous mess of insanity . Life , as we know it , is doomed . 
I have a question : Why are sad country songs so dang addicting ? 
< PROPFEMALE > was almost a frog killer . 
< PROPFIRST > and I are going to look at prom dresses Saturday . He's more picky about colors than I am . xD 
Holy is the Lord , God Almighty . 
I never thought I'd say that I missed < PROPFEMALE > . But , I really do . Especially band wise . I missed when my directors were involved with what I was doing , and I actually enjoyed band . 
My prom dress just came back from the cleaners ! :D It's gorgeous , y'all . (: 
I reall do miss L . D . < PROPFEMALE > ... But at least Iiii don't have school on a SATURDAY ! xD 
Yay for new profile pics ! xD 
I love my dear < PROPFIRST > . (: 
Nose hairs , washing hair , and putting on man mascara . xD 
Congrats < PROPFEMALE > Robinson ! :D < PROPFIRST>'s one lucky guy ! 
Duck pond with my baby today . (: My favorite place to go with him . 
God bless you please , Mrs. Robinson , Heaven holds a place for those who pray . 
They tell me my God does not exsist . But , how then , do you explain the way the clouds are painted in the sky ? Or the way the colors of a sunset reflect upon every part of nature , making it so perfectly beautiful ? Or how one falls into love ? These cannot be created by a burst of atoms in space , but by the greatist Artist in exsistence : God Himself . 
< PROPMALE > field trip tomorrow ! I'm excited . Especially since my table in that class is amazing . xD 
Age is an issue of mind over matter . If you don't mind , it doesn't matter . - < PROPFIRST > Twain 
To all who are going to < PROPFEMALE>'s band banquet -- Take lots of pictures and tell everybody hi for me . :D 
I started school earlier than everyone because of H-E-B , I get out later than everyone because of LISD . This sucks . :P I get out on June 10th ! >:( 
Two weeks . 
Good day ahead of me . (: 
Feels like puking . 
It is better to have loved and lost , than to never have loved at all . And although the pain seems to ache in every part of the body , there is time to heal , and a God to rest your head upon with weary eyes . 
It's so much harder to say you don't care when you do . 
It's confusing . But , actually , not in a bad way . (: 
:DD 
Gets to sit in an auditorium for , like , 4 hours ! :D .. xD 
Tomorrow's the last full day of school . (: Thursday's a half-day , and I get to see < PROPFIRST > ! :D I'm excited . 
Half-day tomorrow . < PROPFIRST > tomorrow ... Extra amazing day . (: 
< PROPFIRST > Justice tomorrow . Muy bien ! :D ... I would say it in < PROPMALE > , but I don't know how . xD 
The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost . - < PROPMALE > K . Chesterton 
I won't forget 9/11 . I won't forget what they did to our country . I won't forget the men that have died for me . Support our troops , or get the heck out of our country . 
NRH2O , NRH2O , NRH2O , the place I want to go , GO ! :D Witttthhhh < PROPFIRST > , his mom , and Chelsy ! :D 
Gotta love bein ' in love with a future < PROPFEMALE > . Oorah ! (: 
And I bet you didn't know , under that live oak , my favorite dog is buried in the yard . 
It's amazing how much you can change in two years . Looking through old pictures is fun . 
Facebook just told me to reconnect with < PROPFIRST > Powers . I don't think that's gonna happen for another seven years , Facebook . xD 
Rearranging furniture is difficult , especially when it's only two not very strong girls . xD 
I love finding stuff you thought you threw away years ago . 
I have curlers in my hair so it'll be curly tomorrow . < PROPFIRST > Justice really doesn't know the pain I go through to be beautiful for him . xD 
Freaking Facebook won't let me upload pictures . >:( 
They're uploaded now . I had to do it one at a time . :P 
< PROPFIRST > Justice took me rock climbing on Friday ... We found something else he's better at , not to mention I found out he trusts me with anything EXCEPT letting him down . xD 
MY birthday's in about a month , and I have a sucky phone . Hmm ... 
You inspire me . (: 
< PROPFEMALE > Powers's cat is going to e thrown out if she doesn't get rid of these dang fleas ! 
Oh triangle , oh triangle , where have you gone ? 
I had the most amazing day of my life . (: Went fishing , ate out , ice skating , movies , bass pro , duck pond ... I , officially , have the best man ever . There is no arguement or exceptions . 
< PROPFEMALE > is a virtue ... A virtue that I lack . :P 
DUDE ! 
I've decided you're not allowed to leave . 
I just totally broke open < PROPFEMALE>'s old diary . xD 
I want to go back to all my friends from when I was little . I want to return to when life was simple . When I wasn't thinking about college or where my life will be headed after this year . Let me go back . Let me go back to when all we wanted was Kool Aid , not alcohol ; Pixi sticks not cigarettes . Take me back , Lord , take me back . ( It kinda sounds lyrical ! :D ) 
Dear Texas , It's too hot . 
I'm here without you , baby . 
This is probably a bad idea ... Buuuut : Like this status and I'll write some things I like about you or a fun memory together on your wall . (: I feel like I'm following the pack . Dang peer pressure ! 
Missing someone sucks . :P 
This week has made me a nervous wreck . 
I'm ready for 8 or 8:30 tomorrow . ): 
Thanks everyone for the happy birthday wishes ! :D I love you all ! (: 
Getting my new phone tomorrowww . (: I miss my < PROPFEMALE > , though . ): 
Waitin ' for Saturday ! (: 
Whoa . 
I don't know how I'm gonna get my schedule for this year . I'm a smart senior . :P 
Welcome to Abercrombie , where we have sizes small , xtra-small , balemic , and anorexic . And everything's overpriced . 
< PROPFEMALE > just told me she needed me . ),: 
< PROPFEMALE > Powers now says she wants my love ... Her and < PROPFIRST > should fight ! xD 
I can't wait till < PROPFEMALE > Powers calls in a few years and tells me a guy dumped her so < PROPFIRST > Justice can knock down the front door with a gun and yell , \WHERE IS HE ?! \"" 
The truck is gone . ): 
Had it not been for you , I would never have been me . 
I would like to say ... I love my relationship with < PROPFIRST > , and I love him . (: Not to mention I'd like to brag about our awesomeness . xD 
I'm hungry . :P 
I dyed muh harr . :P 
If my counselor doesn't give me that schedule change ... >:( 
I get out at 2 AND I got my senior shirt . Booyah ! :D 
Ranger's Game tomorrow night . (: And , to all the people at < PROPFEMALE > I was good friends with , I really miss you guys . I'll make sure to come to a game ! (: 
< PROPFIRST > is going to be the greatest ring bearer ever ! And I will serve punch ! :D 
Schooolll .... I hate school ... At least I get out at 1:53 . :P 
I love Fridays . Not because of high school football , or pep rallies , but I get to skip all of that and leave school at 1:30 to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > . (: 
Almost a year . For real ? (: Ya , I think < PROPFEMALE > . 
Six Flags Sundaaayyy ! (: Then anniversary Monday . Best labor day weekend ever . (: 
Family pictures tonight . I'm actually excited , because the last one I looked el horrribley . :P 
Six flags , six flags , I wanna go to six flags . :D 
Breathe in , take a step back , look at what you have , then react . It's harder than it looks . (: 
So , Central Park is totally flooded . Like , it's rediculous . I would go swim in it , except for the fact that I'd probably get every disease known to man plus some . P.S. Cutting in line for lunch was cool in Jr. High , but when eight people all swarm in where one person's standing , it's just annoying . 
Pre-Cal will be the death of me . 
If you don't support our troops , get out of our country . No questions or exceptions . 
In honor of the lives lost in 9/11 , I pray God is watching over their families on the 9th anniversary of the tragic event . <3 
I love talking to old friends . <3 Too bad I have no friends here . :P 
\I don't even have a boyfriend and I already have a ton of guy problems ! Argh ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Powers " 
I'm 17 . And I still can't stay on the internet past ten . Lame . 
I just beasted my pre-cal homework . Who listened in class ? Oh yeah , that would be me . (: 
Facebook needs to hurry up and make my baby . :P 
< PROPFIRST > Grimm !! :DDD He made an \: O\ " face . (: " 
< PROPFIRST > is awesome ! :) 
I'm am very sleepy . :P 
It's funny to look at those people you knew in elementary school now ; especially the ones that think they're the coolest , bad As on Earth . :P 
You know those people who you just really wanna tag in pictures of you being happy to piss them off ? Yeah , me too . (: 
I gave up caffine , guys . I know you won't believe it , but I did . Since late Sunday night . 
Senior pictures ? Complete . I hope I don't look too rediculous . (:

Coloring books on snow days . (: all I'm missing is my < PROPFIRST > to cuddle with . 
I could live not getting any more letters for the next 10 weeks as long as I get one saying you're getting mine . Those DIs aren't just training my < PROPFIRST > to be tough , they're training me too . 
Please pray for me , for < PROPFIRST > , and for our strength . (:

He got my letters ! :D and is enjoying hydracodone . XD I think that means he no longer has wisdom teeth . 
Dear nose , if I have to sleep one more night with my mouth open because of you , my mouth will turn into sand . So quit it .

Protesting at military funerals is WRONG . I don't give a flying flip if you think it's your right to freedom of speech . You have those rights until it causes harm to others , and it does . This protesting should not be allowed .

I didn't know I needed your goofiness . I didn't know I needed you at first , < PROPFIRST > , but God sure did . (: 
It's Friday ! Only 5 weeks left ! :D

I'm a worry wart . :/ 
My dearest love , it's almost dawn . \ 
I've been lying here all night long wondering where you might be . \ 
I saw your momma and I showed her the ring . \ 
Man on the television said something , so I couldn't sleep . \ 
But I'll be all right , I'm just missing you . \ 
... And this is me kissing you : Xs and Os . \ 
In a letter from home . 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s spelling < PROPFEMALE > . (: 
There's a ticket drawing at the spelling < PROPFEMALE > , and the lady's reading the < PROPFIRST > off like they're going out of style . The spelling < PROPFEMALE>'s for dyslexic kids . XD 
It's too cold ! Had to run to the car like a crazy person . Poor baby probably had no idea what was going on .

Twenty-niiinnnee ! :D 
My back . Is . Killing me . 
It's that annoying temperature outside where it can't decide if it's gonna be chilly or warm . 
I believe I can flyyyyy . I believe I can touch the skyyy . 
Hoping and praying for a letter tomorrow . 
Guess what ? 28 ! (: I looove my < PROPFIRST > ! :D 
I usually get a letter on Thursday , but that darn mailman hasn't come by yet . :P 
My baby got fired . ): If I was allowed , I'd totally give those DIs a peice of my mind ! All the SLs got replaced by contract PFCs . >:( 
Every day is a day closer to you . (: 
What happened to Japan ? 
4 weeks till my love graduates ! Can't wait ! :D 
I heard that tsunami's gonna hit California . :/ I'm not a calm person right now . 
Okay , I just searched the effects that the tsunami will have on California . For Camp Pembleton and the MCRD there will be only stronger waves . There hasn't been any reports on waves over 2 ft . Thank you library and internet ! :D 
27 days ! (: less than the month of February ! :D

Watching One Born Every Minute . I'm definitely getting an epideral as soon as possible . :P 
Today's going by sooo sloooww . 
I don't think I'll ever quit worrying about < PROPFIRST > . Sooo ready for these next 3 weeks to be over . 
Sometimes I feel like it's not fair you're gone while everyone else's boyfriends or fiancees or husbands are right there to take care of them . Then I really think about it . I'd rather be a military wife than any other kind . I've got the pride , I've got the guts , I've got the strength . I'm supporting my man . Thank God for the military , and thank God for military sweethearts ! 
Argh . It's too early . Heading to Arkansas as soon as we pack . Only 21 days left . (:

Burned my finger making grilled cheese . Then , tasted the sandwhich , and its was disgusting . So I burned myself for nothing , got a bad taste in my mouth , and now sitting here eating peanut butter and crackers . If this isn't a sign I need my man here , I don't know what is . 
In a week from this moment , I'll be on a plane to california . (: Will the next 7 to 8 days please go by faster ? 
One more week . It's all I can think and dream about .
