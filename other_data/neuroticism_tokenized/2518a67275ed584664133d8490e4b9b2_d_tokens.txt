So I have finally joined the masses and created an account on a social networking site . Whoo ! I have a good reason though ! My SkillsUSA chapter at < PROPFIRST > Tuttle ( student organization ) is creating a facebook group to stay in touch and post updates . Of course ... the group hasn't actually been created yet , but , well ... that just gives me time to have fun exploring ! ;) 

Stuck waiting on my next class ... which isn't until 6 pm . :( I can't wait until English starts back up next week . Also ... is it odd that I wrote a college essay on going to a horror movie w/ friends ? :P 
I'm 18 at last ! 0.0 I'm shocked and excited and happy and hyper . ( Last part is due to today's diet , so far I've had cake , cookies , dr pepper , and chocolate caramel chocolate chip mocha . Yay for birthday snacks , lol . ) 
Finally got a job ! First day was today , worked from 4- 9:30 . Everyone there is really nice , yay . :) 
I start a new job on Monday ! Working for my school's ITS department ! YAAAAAAY ! * happy dance * 
So ... I am a State champion , it seems . At the Oklahoma Business Professionals of < PROPFEMALE > state conference I won first place for Network Administration using Microsoft , and my team won second in Network Design Team . I'm going to California , whoo ! :D I also got a lovely $ 1,000 tuition waver for OSUIT . I went into shock when I saw it ... literally . 
I'm looking to buy a car ( finally ) . If anyone knows someone who's selling theirs , I'd appreciate the info . :) 
Craziness for the next week ! I'm in Tulsa for the SkillsUSA State Conference . We get back Tuesday ... and leave Wednesday for California and the BPA National Conference ! And , joy , I'll be speaking in front of 3000 people Sunday . ... Meep . ._. I also got up too early . Already ready and we don't meet til 8 . Heh . 
A tearful farewell to the 09/10 state officer team . You all are amazing . 
I cleaned lots and lots today . Hate to do it but glad to have it done . :) \ 
\ 
Baker Street = awesome 
Was at the ER until about midnight last night . Soooo tired ... but glad < PROPFIRST > is getting better at last . \ 
Thank you a million times over for the ride < PROPFIRST > , and for sticking with us . You're a true friend . 
I'M FINALLY GETTING A CAR !!!!!! * happy dance*\ 
To my wonderful friends , who've helped me so much with getting around where I need to be , thank you so much . I know I've bugged many of you asking for rides , but those days will finally be behind us . :) 
I'm about 20 minutes out from fort worth . I'll visit with my wonderful family for a few hours ( love y'all!) and then its on to Longview and my new car ! :) 
Amtrak is making sure I get my exercise . Got to the train 6 minutes before it leaves just to be told I have to buy my ticket inside , instead of on the train like at okc . * pantpantpant * barely made it ... 
Driving is fun ! 
I just got back from CTU - training for student organization state officers in oklahoma . I met lots of really cool people and learned some amazing stuff . I can't wait to take what I learned and help the SkillsUSA district officers at SLI next week ! :) 
First day preparing for SLI is over . Running on an hour of sleep and I am exhausted ! But I can tell this week is going to be amazing . Looking forward to seeing the campers as they arrive tomorrow . :) 
Day 2 of SLI is over . Everyone is so amazing . It is so wonderful watching everyone break out of their shell and embrace the challenges and opportunities before them . 
Today is the last full day of SLI . Three cheers for SkillsUSA ! 
On my way home at last . SLI was amazing , but I'm excited to be on my way back . 
I got a kitten ! \ 
... who just ran across my face . Yay kitties . 
I'm on fire ! 
Took a last minute trip to Texas to see the family over the weekend . Also stopped by Daniels family and he met mine . All went very well . Although the drive was a little more eventful than I would have liked ... 
< PROPFIRST > is awesome and way more funier than me . 
Playing Munchkin with some good friends . Glad it's the weekend ! :) 
Please keep us , and particularly < PROPFIRST > , in your thoughts . At the emergency room again . I hate tonsels . 
People should become nocturnal in the summer . My brain is fried . @_@ ' 
< PROPFIRST > is cooking burgers ! They smell sooooo good . \ 
It feels like it should be the weekend . * sigh * 
\You are now fighting baby intelligent armored demonic crabs . \ " Have fun ! :D " 
Things are coming together at last . < PROPFIRST > has a job . I still have my job . I've got a car . And finally -- only 8 months after leaving Job Corps -- I have a BED !!!! * happy dance * I am so happy right now that words cannot describe it . So I will drink some more coffee and do another happy dance . ^__^ 
< PROPFIRST > and I put together a dining room table and some chairs that someone gave us yesterday , along with a couple of bar stools . In the spirit of making our apartment look more like a home again , I cleaned everything ! Seeing it all nice and neat makes me so happy ... I'm gonna try and keep it that way . ( ... no laughing from the peanut gallery ! :P ) 
School has started up again ! But everyone in the mornings that I knew is gone ... :( And in the afternoon I'm working . Ah well . I'm almost done anyway . :D 
Plans fell through but it's ok , we've got movies and are relaxing at home . Today is a good day . :) 
I can't wait for this weekend . Don't even have any plans ... I just really want 3 days off . :D 
It's just not fair . I'm home sick , and at 8 am sharp construction starts outside my window . Very , very * loud * construction . > < 
I'm going to Washington D.C. on saturday !!! It's been just over 2 years since I've been ... I can't wait ! :D 
My car is about to die ... 
I'm in DC ! 
There is no feeling in the world like walking into the < PROPMALE > memorial . It's what I was looking forward to most and it didn't disappoint ! The overwhelming awe , standing where so much history has been made ... amazing . 
Back home at last . I had a blast in DC and was truly inspired ... but it's good to be back . Pics will be up soon . 
How is it that on the day I got only one hour of sleep , I feel more awake and refreshed than I have all week ? XD 
Photos of the DC trip up ! :) 
Does anyone know the address for < PROPFEMALE>'s okc call center ? I can't find it . 
Thank you for the birthday wishes :3 
Just had a couple hundred people sing happy birthday to me . Wow . \ 
Not ready to be done with SkillsUSA ... I'll miss y'all! 
My day is so much brighter now ... I was just stopped by someone who saw my farewell speech on Friday , who told me how inspired he and his class were and how impressed and proud of me they were . He's a chapter president and where he thought it was just a silly class thing before , he's inspired to get more involved because of what he watched me do ... It feels so good to know you've made a difference . :) 
Had a really great interview at < PROPFEMALE > this morning . Hopefully I'll hear something soon . :) 
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY !!!! * dances*\ 
Starting November 1st , I will be an Enterprise Technical Support Analyst at < PROPFEMALE > ! And get this ... I got TWO job offers from them , and was told to pick which one I wanted ! How awesome is that ?!?! :D \ 
* dances some more * WHOOOOOOO ! 
If your Dad is or was your hero , your best friend or just the best Dad ever , whether you are blessed to have your Dad still with you , or if he is in Heaven , copy this into your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad and that you love him . 
Yes !! After years of playing various rhythm games , I've finally done it ! I just got a 100 percent on a song on rock band ! :D \ 
... Yes I'm a nerd . Leave me alone . :P 
Tomorrow is my last day at work here at < PROPFIRST > Tuttle ... this feels strange and sad . >.> \ 
Yay new job though ! Heh . 
Happy Halloween ! :D 
Awesome first day at < PROPFEMALE > today ! I am really excited to learn a lot of new information over this next month's training . :) 
The world today is so filled with apathy and cruelty . Perhaps that makes it that much sweeter when a perfect stranger goes out of their way to show compassion and offer up an act of kindness . I know that as ugly as the world can be , people are still good at their core . If you have faith in nothing else , have faith in humanity . To all the kind people out there : thank you . 
I am so happy , so thankful , that I am home for thanksgiving and got to spend the day with the people I love . Hope you all had a great holiday . :) 
I took my first call this morning ! :D Wasn't planned or expected , I was just supposed to be listening . Was an easy call , but still couldn't remember what all to say/ask . Kept my voice confident though ! ^^ 
It's friday , I'm over my cold , and I'm already leaps and bounds better at taking calls than I was when I started . Whoo ! :D 
Is it bad when you think the work day's almost over ... and then you realize it's only 11 am ? >.> Today's been crazy 
Thanks to the combined efforts of my dad and my boyfriend ( Dad texting , < PROPFIRST > waking me up ) , I got to see the lunar eclipse last night ! Whoo !! :D Did anyone else go out and see it ? 
Hope you all had a great Christmas ! < PROPFIRST > and I spent the day together - stockings , fireplace , home-cooked steak dinner with real mashed potatoes ... good day . :) 
It snowed today !!! : D Too bad none of it stuck ... but maybe we'll get some more snow tonight/tomorrow . ^^ 
\Thank you so much ! You are a champ ! You are the only bright part of my day . \ " \ 
I'm getting a caaaaaaar !!! : D 
\Okay 
Pretzels and peanut butter m& ms. Breakfast of champions . 
There's a wonderful , simple pleasure about just getting up in the morning with the one you love , even just to ride in to work together . <3 
Retro pic ! : D 
Going to the okc science museum with my baby today . Haven't been to a science museum in ages , I'm so excited ! : D 
< PROPFEMALE > . 
Just found out another old classmate will be starting at < PROPFEMALE > soon . < PROPFIRST > Tuttle is taking over !!! :P 
Looks like I may be going kayaking soon .
