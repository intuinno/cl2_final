YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY !! 
And I know you fell helpless now ... and I know .... you feel alone .... that's the same road ... that I'm on ......... 
I wanted you to know .... that I love the way you laugh .... I want to hold you high and steal your pain .... away 
In a box .... high up on the shelf .... meant for you ..... no one else ... there's a piece of a puzzle known as life ..... wrapped in guilt ............... sealed up tight .

One day you will ask me ..... \What do you value more .... me or your life ? \ " I will reply .... \ " My life . \ " You will walk away .... not knowing that you are my life .... ;P " 
Our hearts hide what we can not say .... our eyes say what we try to hide . ;P

Both personality types have an uncanny ability to see both sides of an argument without prejudice , making them excellent problem-solvers . While very much attuned to the energies around them , Aquarians have a deep need to take time out alone and away to rejuvenate themselves . The keyword for this sign is imagination . The Aquarian can see a world of possibilities even when there appears to be none ... hmmm .. ;P 
Thought this was quiet interesting ... Aquarian Personality\ 
Aquarians present themselves in one of two ways . One on hand , you’ll see someone who is shy , and quiet . On the other , an Aquarian can be boisterous , eccentric , and energetic . Both are deep thinkers with a love of helping others . Highly intellectual , this is a sign of fierce independence that prizes intuition tempered with logic 
Off to see \No Strings Attached\ " ;P " 
If you could be any flavour JELLY BELLY jelly bean .... what kind would you be ... and why ..... ;P

If you love me .... I will love you . If you respect me .... I will respect you . If you need me .... I will always be there . If you treat me like nothing .... you will get nothing . ;P
