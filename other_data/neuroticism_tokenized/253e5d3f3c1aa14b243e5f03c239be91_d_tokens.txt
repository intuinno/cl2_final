the whole changing your profile picture to your favorite cartoon \

if children see pictures of cartoons they will add them . It was \ 
currently on the program \Internet Frauds\ " and will apparently be on TV \

I wear make up - so I'm fake . I like to get dressed up - so I love myself . I say what I think - so I'm a bitch . I cry sometimes - so I'm an attention seeker . I talk to guys - so I'm a flirt . I stand up for myself - so I'm mouthy . I like food - so I'm fat . Seems like you can't do anything these days without being labeled . SO LABEL ME ! I don't give a crap .

When I was a kid I didn't have Nintendo DS , I had a Tonka truck , and a sandbox . If I didn't eat what my mom made , I didn't eat . And I dealt with it . I didn't think of telling my parents , no , and I got my butt beat if I did . Life wasn't hard , it was life .. And I survived . Repost if you appreciate the way you were raised .
