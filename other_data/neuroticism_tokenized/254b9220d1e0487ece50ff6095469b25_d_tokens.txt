Tomorrow is the last day of Semester 1 . I wonder if there'll be a snow day ... 

SHAQUILLEEEEeeeee . 
I feel tired , and I'm wondering what I should do right now . 
Farmville seems repulsive :D 
I'm loggin ' off . 
< PROPFIRST > is in the hospital for an unknown reason . 
Today is the first day of Winter ! Though , I feel blank . Is it the changing season that exausts me ? 
Shaquille ( Shakill Moore ) looks like T . I . \ 
Go look em ' both up and see for yourself . 
< PROPFIRST > ! < PROPFIRST > ! I summon you both over to my house ! * HURRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH !!!!!! * 
I'm going to my dad's house tommorow for an early Christmas celebration , along with my Grandpa < PROPFIRST > . I'll get picked up sometime in the afternoon and I'll be spending the night . I hope I get money so I can < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > :) 
I forgot , my dad's house has internet but it has a password for anyone else , and they don't know it , so yeah , I obviously won't be on here . Off topic , I have Engineering homowork , my mom's making me read a book called Artemis Fowl by the end of Winter Break ( it's 385 pages ) :( And I have to download a ton of songs for my mom as a present with her request . XD 
< PROPMALE > out with my dad , stepmom , Grandpa < PROPFIRST > , Grandpa in law < PROPFIRST > , and my Grandma < PROPFEMALE > , and got 60$ . Earkier today felt less lively than yesterday though and not much like Christmas . 
Which the 60$ means I can < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > sometimeeeeeeeee ! And Emilyyyyy and Ericccc and < PROPFEMALE > aaa no not realllllyy on the < PROPFEMALE > parttttt ! 
I just added some cool , some creepy , and some funny Pokemon Pics . 
Tomorow is the last day of Winter Break . I hope you all find it significant . And I still can't spell tommorow . Bah ! 
Meh , you guys all keep sending me these tag descriptions but I ONLY HAVE 17 COINS SO IT'S USELESS ! And I stopped going on facebook for a few days and I already have 20 notifications @_@ Heheh , I should go to sleep now ... 
Everyone talks about the snowday tomorrow . But will it even snow at all ? \ 
If we DO get a snow day , what should I do ... 
Everyone , who is your favorite friend right now , and what are your favorite words ? [ They don't have to be in a sentence]\ 
My favorite friend right now would have to be < PROPFEMALE > , and my favorite words are : Paradise , Cascade , Ravage , and < PROPFEMALE > . Oh , and Boing . I just love the way that sounds ! 
WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH 
You guys are all jealous of my jealousy ! 
I'm blank 
* Just had < PROPFIRST > over from Saturday evening to 10 something a.m. today ! There was a lot of awesome stuff that happened and I felt pretty darn expressive and refreshed . \ 
Subject change , I have a dentist appointment and I know I have to leave around 2 p.m. I hope I don't have any cavities ; I haven't been brushing my teeth everyday and drills really put me on edge ... 
So like omg I ' waiting to get picked up to go to the dentist . \ 
Bah , it takes forever there , so my impatience goes off the walls ! 
Yup , just got back from the dentist , and BING , I have no cavities ! They just said to floss more often . Heh , they misspelled my name tag as \Mtichell Becker \"" 
GIMME A KIR ROYALE !!!! 
Hahah , I took a 5-hour energy drink during the middle of my first class today . \ 
It was awful and bitter , but it worked great ! However , I got tired again at the middle of my last class , gym . That , or it could be because I raced the whole class and made sure I stayed ahead of everyone . My chest stung after that ... 
Graphic Tabletttttttttttttttttttttttttt 
I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > , then < PROPMALE > this weekend . Both were so awesome ! \ 
I feel so refreshed today that my eyes are teary . 
School was pretty nice , not the best , but not bad . 
Yay , I have proactive now ! I hope it works :3 
I got my work doneeeeee ! Well , at least everything due tomorrow . I still have some stuff that's due at a later time , but whatever ! And wtf is so cool about Morphsuits ? It's a popular thing , especially on Facebook apparently , but I think they're pointless 
Well , today was a pleasant day , and my friends were awesome and I felt so clear minded . I feel like I'm making progress in life of some sort , I dunno . Regardless , I have to return to homework now though . Bye bye ! 
I'm about to play < PROPFEMALE > Ocean Till The End Of Time ... but not till the end of time , cause ' I have school tomorrow . 
Well , today has been a mixture of satisfaction , uniqueness with a balance between calm and energetic . 
Let's all make this a Spring Break of productivity and self-attentiveness ! 
Oh yeah , and it's my mom's birthday today :) 
I feel very calm and content right now . I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with DaVaughn ( who most of you don't know ) for the first time , which was really nice . Spring Break has been amazing so far ... 
Ah , it's the first day of my favorite month of the year in my favorite season ... April 1st ! 
Meh , I feel so blank today and my micro sd card stopped working so I can't play my ds games or draw with \Colors ! \ " and it's cold and I feel blank-minded today :( \ 
Storms make me tired , ergo , I am a bit tired . Howeverrrr , school starts back up again tomorrow and it feels like it has been forever ! I'm in the mood to see my friends again . 
Yeah , I just got home from working at my Grandpa < PROPFIRST>'s house . I basically moved from the weight room at school to raking his big yard , so I'm pretty exausted and I have blisters on my hand form not wearing gloves :( 
Okay , I have 2 blisters on my hand , I'm a < PROPMALE > bit sunburnt , my proactive is working slower than I want it to , I pulled my arm/shoulder muscle in gym , and I got kicked in the chest . I'm just gettin ' all kinds of hurt X < I'm wondering who I can < PROPFEMALE > out with this weekend , I'd prefer either DaVaughn , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , or < PROPFEMALE > .
