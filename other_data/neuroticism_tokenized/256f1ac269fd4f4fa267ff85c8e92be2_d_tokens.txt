finally got to leave her house in this winter wonderland 
And I watch as the dagger draws nearer . Try as I might , I cannot stop it as I watch it pierce the surface . I clench my fist in hopes of numbing the pain , but instead , my vision becomes blurry and narrows until I black out .

so much homework , so little time\ 
... thanks for keeping me alive < PROPFEMALE > Rushton and < PROPFEMALE > Prisco !!! 
wishes that someone just knew the pain .... 
In my few years on this luminous orb , life has swallowed me whole and spit me back out . I tell tales that stretch one's imagination to their wildest dreams . I come with scars from my past and look with both caution and excitement towards the future . My wounds have blistered and now form a new shape on my imperfectness , and yet I see others and realize that they too have disfigurements . 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . Will you make it your status for a least one hour ? ... Promote love & acceptance , not hate . 
can't wait for my weekend to start ! 
should prolly start trying to figure stuff out on her own ... but still loves the late nights with < PROPFEMALE > Prisco :) 
\Today has been a crappy week\ " < PROPFEMALE > Prisco haha <3 u ! " 
what did i learn to do this week ? how to draw heaven and hell ... and get food in the middle of class time while doing it 
could really use a good hug right about now :( 
loves < PROPFEMALE > litchfield even though i dont have her as a friend :( 
you know someone's crazy when they're saying thank you to a printer ... Lucy Prisco but love it ! <3 
stuck in this place with no way out , tryin ' to survive one day at a time . 
I have this strange feeling spreading through my entire back . I look into the mirror and what do I see ? Why , of course , a knife sticking out between my shoulder blades ! 
school during break = silence ... heater ... silence ... heater ... silence ... singing ?!? 
waiting ... but slowly washing away 
sometimes ... i don't like time . its like a knife being thrown at my head and i have to react in a split-second . 
... never thought id ever feel like this 
has to keep telling herself that she can make it through this week . RIP <3 
mine has a few worn-out patches and a couple of holes ... and it's RED ! 
being shred to pieces as if it didn't matter . being drowned as if no one cared . being left behind as if i weren't real . 
about to be devoured by a monster and no one even notices that it is approaching 
But with each step further into the great unknown , \ 
the hope begins to fade and I am left with nothing . \ 
I am now completely numb\ 
and my thoughts of turning back have multiplied . \ 
I cannot prevent this feeling of sadness\ 
nor can I get rid of it . \ 
I feel that complete silence is the only way out , \ 
complete loss seems my only escape in this world . 
walking pneumonia ... bronchitis ... anemia ... flu ... can i just put you all in a hat and pull one out so i know what you are and get rid of you ?
