violently knits 
thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! 
the sun's not yellow , it's chicken 
new puppyyy =) 
proving that my dog is NOT fat ... just fluffy 
Dog carcass in alley this morning . Tire tread on burst stomach . This city's afraid of me . I've seen its true face . The streets are extended gutters & the gutters are full of blood & when the drains finally scab over , all the vermin will drown . The accumulated filth of all their sex & murder will foam up about their waists & all the whores & politicians will look up and shout \save us\ " ... and I'll whisper \ " no . \"" 
wishes this drive was a bit more scenic 
the blues had a baby and they named it rock n ' roll 
the jubilation and the sorrow , it’s an avenue you must pursue 
Remember , remember the 5th of November . The gunpowder treason and plot . I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot . 
this is the first day of my life 
but i'd rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery 
she saw the lights , she saw a pale english face . some strange machines repeating beats and a thumping bass . visions of pills that put you in a loving trance , that make it possible for all white boys to dance . 
laying out , work , chambersburg

getting new piercings with sissy 
< PROPFEMALE > called another bet and < PROPFIRST > up the < PROPFIRST > of hearts

may every < PROPFEMALE > you wish upon and every hope you're hanging on come true . out of everybody in the world there's no one who deserves it more than you . i hope you find everything you've been dreaming of - only good things , no inbetweens - just peace and love .
