< PROPMALE > and I went to the < PROPFEMALE > garden in the rain today , wet and green and gray , with climbing skelatons on trellises and everything cut back to thorny stems . By June it will be bursting with color and heavenly scent . I'm invoking the principle of rapid and glorious renewal for all of us . Love to you all . Happy New Year . 

Rereading < PROPFEMALE > Tey's sublime \Brat Farrar\ " . I wanted to adapt it into a screenplay but just found out somebody already did and < PROPMALE > Affleck is somehow involved . Travesty ! "

The secret < PROPMALE > Writers ' Room at the library , with special list and key to enter . Very sacrosanct . Totally silent . Kinda spooky . When the other writer left , I started whipping my fake fur coat through the air like a matador's cape , silently shouting Kool and the Gang's \Celebration\ " and dancing like in the opening credits of \ " Fame\ " . I don't think anyone saw me through the bevelled glass . " 
Go see Vernacular Wood next time they're playing ! < PROPMALE > Couture and company will make you love the 90's hits -- even the ones you hate ! 
Anyone who looks up my first name in the urban slang dictionary will understand why I'm not posting it here for random onlookers to associate with me . I knew it was a powerful masculine name , but COME ON !

Tallulah just added asparagus to the list of green vegetables she prefers over chicken . Weird cat . 
Today , I don't believe you . 
Wahclella Falls . Snow melting and thin walls of water trickling through electric green moss ; the small river rising in fluffy white swirls laced with milky aquamarine . Fast moving falling water makes me shriek and laugh . A bald eagle gliding over . A good day . 
Big storm and romantic power outtage last night . Candlelight and cold pizza . 
just held a 10 hour old baby lamb , drank way too much < PROPFEMALE > kombucha , watched a romanti-comic porn mock-doc set in Portland , and was gifted with a giant framed fulgora < PROPFEMALE > according to Japanese custom . I'm going to bed . 
Tallulah is at the open window trying to smell the music as my neighbor's flute quartet plays . 
I know what to do . It's easy .

Got caught in the storm and nearly literally blown off my feet several times . The wind caught my umbrella and blew my skirt out like a sail and my tippy toes were barely touching the ground most of the way home . The only ballast keeping me earthbound was the freezing water in my sopping clothes . 
On my own today , doing absolutely nothing . Glorious .
