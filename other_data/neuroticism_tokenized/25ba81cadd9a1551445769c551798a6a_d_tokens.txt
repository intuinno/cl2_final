I'm celebrating my birthday tomorrow night . Looking forward to it . 

I'm geting tired of all of the problems I'm having with Facebook . I'm here less and less these days due to all of the problems loading everything . The game apps have the most problems too . 
Pujols wins his 2nd consecutive MVp award and 3rd overall . :) 
Enjoying the great weather that is spring time in Arizona -- 86 degrees , no clouds with a light breeze . Days like this are the reason I moved to AZ . 
Show me a man who views the world the same at 40 as he did at 20 and I'll show you a man that has wasted 20 years . 
Thanks for all of the b-day wishes . Had to work today but I've got the next 3 days off to celebrate . 
I do the very best I know how , the very best I can , and I mean to keep on doing so until the end . -- < PROPMALE > Lincoln\

That quote pretty much sums up my entire approach to life .
