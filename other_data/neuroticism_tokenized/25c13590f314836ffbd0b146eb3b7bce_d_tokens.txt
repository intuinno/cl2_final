and suddenly , it isn't what it used to be , and after all this time , it worked out just fine , and suddenly , i am where i'm supposed to be , and after all the tears , i was supposed to be here ... 
i think i'm going insane with all these fan < PROPFEMALE > posts ... as soon as i'm done with my icky english essay , i plan on deleting them all . ALL OF THEM !!! ... i really wish i knew how to make an evil face on here ... 
does anybody know how to mass delete \become a fan\ " groups ?! ANYBODY ?!?!?! " 
I'm so proud of myself !!! Figured out how to get rid of all the fan pages faster . It's now a ratio of 3 groups to 1 Malea ... as opposed to 197 groups ...

is thinking about going outside and running around like a manaic ... i think i'll do it 
CURSE YOU , AQUA SCUM !!!

I LOVE MAKING POWERPOINTS INVOLVING CANADIANS !!! Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > Houts ! 
if you are what you eat , then i am lots of fried chicken . MAN i taste good !!! 
take ... a subway footlong . cut it in half . put the two halves side by side . and picture it covered with ants . so much so that you can't see the sandwich . and then imagine all the sandwich-gone . leaving just the ants . i saw that last night on a walk ... grossest thing i've ever seen ... 
on the way back to sioux city tonight , i was looking out the window ... and i noticed that everything seemed kinda small ... like what a person with perfect vision would see when they tried on my glasses ... so i'm thinking to myself ... maybe i have SPIDER POWERS and i don't need my glasses any more !!! good thing i wasn't that excited cuz i took off my glasses ... only to find that everything was blurry again :( 
isn't excited for school tomorrow ... xP 
DEAR GOD , thank you for thunderstorms . they light up the night . they bring late night rain so we don't have to deal with umbrellas during the day . and they make people that love you smile . enjoy your bowling :)

Love is a beautiful thing\ 
That brings together people of every generation\ 
Love can heal the pain of a broken world\

Keep searching for your perfect heart\ 
It doesn't matter who you are\ 
We all have our scars ...

I know that i will when i look back someday\ 
And see how you've brought beauty from ashes\ 
And made me as gold purified through these flames
