The Sand Man was not very generous to me last night ... it must be all that Long Island erosion that's got him miffed . 
As < PROPMALE > Penrose , one of Britain’s leading theoretical physicists , has commented , “In order to produce a universe resembling the one in which we live , the Creator would have to aim for an absurdly < PROPFEMALE > volume of the phase space of possible universes” . 
How < PROPFEMALE > is this volume ? According to Penrose , if we let x = 10123 , the volume of phase space would be about 1/10x of the entire phase space . This precision is much , much greater than the precision that would be required to hit an individual proton given the entire visible universe were a dart board ! 
If we existed in a world where at our disposal we had no means of percieving ourselves ( no mirrors , no cameras , no relfective surfaces , etc . ) , would we know who we are ? 
\The wild geese do not intend to cast their reflection ; the water has no mind to receive their image . \ " - Zenrin poem " 
yet in such a way , be it observed , that it is the particular individual who , after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal , now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal , for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute . \ " , 201 0-0 4-29 17:56:26 " 
I have once again fallen victim to the bane of mankind's existence : I have begun to question it all ... 
A great devide sperates us from our dreams . That gorge will onyl grow deeper and greater if we let it erode under the doubt of our ability . We must sustain our faith in believeing that once we leap from its precipise , we will fly .

It hangs deep in his robes , a delicate\ 
clapper at the center of a bell . \ 
It moves when he moves , a ghostly fish in a\ 
halo of silver sweaweed , the hair\ 
swaying in the dark and the heat -- and at night\ 
while his eyes sleep , it stands up\ 
in praise of God .

I wish everyone in the world were in love . It's not something that can be described , it has to be experienced . It goes against every human instinct ; against every logical sense . It's not that love is blind , it's that love sees beyond what can be seen , it delves deeper , peering into the transcendent , observing the ethereal and understanding the intangible . It's nature is unnatural - indeed , supernatural . 
\I did not get my Spaghetti-O's . I got spaghetti . I want the press to know this ! \ " \ 
When you gaze into the face of beauty , true beauty , you discover it's complexion is remarkably identical to that of a looking glass . For beauty , when truly beheld , is discovered most palpable within one's self . 
Not in a manner narcissistic or vain , but one epiphanical , wherein the realization that beauty is not something to be idealized but something to be honored , respected with a queer sense of retarded wisdom , its etiquette and edict transcending meager understanding , for it is not meant to be defined - its definition is its indefinity , - teaches us that it resides in all things . Including ourselves .

had a horrendous dream last night , likely exacerbated by deep seeded apprehensions . Of course , when rationaly considered , at least in the confides of reality , - unless of course you're Descartes , but let's not go there - the angst menifested therein had its origin in the real world . However , < PROPFIRST > could have simply infiltrated my mind and incepted the trepidation into my subconscious . 
I'm still trying to decide which is more reassuring .

Just heard back from a magazine I submitted to . They've decided to publish my poem in thier latest issue . Woot ! 
What is a pen if it cannot write ? \ 
What is a journey that has no end ? \ 
What is a laugh without a sigh ? \ 
What is a legislator without any friends ? \ 
What is \Me\ " without \ " You\ " ? \ 
What is the big debate over this mosque at Ground Zero ? I can understand people's apprehensions , and I do not wish to critisize them . However , if it were a church or a synagogue , I believe the reaction would be much more subdued . Islam is a rather lovely religion whose congrigational majority are not radicals bent on terrorism and whose doctrine closes resembles both Judaism and Christianity .

Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Hayes for this link . Huckabee's argument is well founded , and I think it represents a good direction in which to go for Education Reform ( a subject I'm quite passionate about , along with Prison Reform ) . It could represent a new kind of curriculum in which academics and creativity are taught in conjunction with one another . \

Obama's state of the union address contained a lot of lovely snippets of hope and nostalgia . I found it rife with things spoken of before . He ( the man I voted for ) has set out to accomplish a lot , but very little of it has seen fruition . Obama has set his bar high and taken on tasks not easily solved . I don't blame him entirely , for his aspirations are years in the making and likely will span beyond his presidency .

What is the judge of a man's genius ? A piece of paper , a reputation , his mannerisms and general zeitgeist ? Is it his apparent perfections ... or his hidden flaws ? Einstein had his demons , de Vinci his doubts , Leibniz his guilt and Mozart his mistakes . It is the personally perceived incompetence - the subjective persuasions , hidden from history , - that make a man a genius . He who is most vexed has genius vast .
