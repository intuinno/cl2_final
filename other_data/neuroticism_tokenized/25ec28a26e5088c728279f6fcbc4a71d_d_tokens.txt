stop saying fucking r.i.p. people , it's absurd . Nobody is going to enjoy an afterlife like you think . We're just going to sit there and rot . I guess that's a type of peace if you want to think of it that way .

storms are raging on the path to home , once so silent and calm .. the desperate glare of the dark light is cast on the fallen one .

Thank You to everybody who wished me a happy birthday . I appreciate it very much . My audition went pretty well , although some parts surprised me quite a bit .. Good night !

if < PROPMALE > Noonan were a woman , we would make the ultimate cynical couple . 
the man who crashed the plane in < PROPFIRST > was an intelligent man . It's a shame he took his life and others when he could have put his smarts to good use rather than throw them away in an act that few others can understand . 
loves that the biggest moneymaker in the history of the Earth ( no need to ask who ) has given no significant donation to the relief effort in the country which it is responsible for overpopulating , Haiti . They can pay over $1.3 BILLION in amends for their own sexual abuse suits , but not this . Nice .

has a kind of stupid but reasonable point floating around in my head ; what's with the craze about BASS BASS BASS when it comes to headphones and speakers ? Companies should be working on taming the shitty high end of their products before they compensate with a million dBs of bass . :S 
fellow Tuxedo Seniors : when is the Government final ? 
new iPhone looks ridiculous ; when was the last time you saw a phone record 720p HD video , or let you video chat using it ? Apple never disappoints .

sorry I just posted a status but I had to say that all hope for Guitar World magazine is lost : the Black Veil Brides have an article , while a band with incredible guitar solos ( Wintersun ) has yet to be featured in six years of existence . What is wrong with the world ?

forgot how much he loved his Strat , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . Wish I could have all my instruments in Boston T_T 
looks like I might get my preferred schedule after all . I iz happy panda :) 
stupid internal clock needs a new battery . 
heading back to Berklee . Sad to leave NY but pumped to finish the semester , and I'll be back in a few weeks . =) 
any Berklee people have ensembles to recommend ? I register tomorrow and have no idea which to join . Halp . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone , or are related to someone , who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is real , and should be taken seriously You could be sitting next to a sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity ... and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness ... 93% won't copy and paste this because they don't know how to copy and paste . 
watching Inception , forgot how good this was . :D 
just wrote his first 2-5-1 into a jazz song for writing skills . Any of you are now granted permission to kill me . 
RIP Caffe Dolcé :'( 
so many Pokémon !!!!! I like it . December is the shit . 
just wrote a 16 measure tune in 30 minutes , awww yeah . 
only the lonely ( and maybe < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ) know the Canadian freeway . 
is feeling introspective . 
good morning/afternoon/thing , Boston . Really hope it snows sometime soon . 
needs to know where he can get some nutella !!!!!!!!!! Tedeschi !?!? Walgreens ?! 
awesome facebook , just keep changing shit ! We all appreciate it a lot ! 
the saddest moment of my day is when I stare ruefully into my empty spicy chicken bowl . Brutal . 
Dunkin Donuts coffee is one of the most caustic , vile substances known to man . Why do I put myself through this ? lol 
Falconer started their new record today ! Also , birthday in 12 days ? Where did my 18th year go ?? :s 
I correct my statement from yesterday : Green Mountain coffee is one of the most caustic , vile substances known to man . bahaha 
lolz at all these < PROPFIRST > . When did Facebook turn into Formspring ? Too sheepish to give compliments or aspersions openly ? 
survived < PROPMALE > Harrigan's Guitar Torture Lab :) Did I say torture ? I meant performance . 
doesn't want to even think about getting out of bed , let alone start the pile of papers and projects that has accumulated . 
it is by doing whatever that one becomes whomever . 
Come Clarity just came on after listening to Colony and all I can say is .. In Flames , I am disappoint . 
the fact remains thus : caffeine helps compel one towards the completion of necessary work . Thank you , giant 24 oz Tedeschi coffee , you have served me well . 
free caf party was pretty epic , definitely the most excited I've been to eat caf food since the first day of college , lol . 
just guessed the exact price of a guitar minus one dollar . I am such a gear nerd . 
destroyed the proficiency material but didn't play particularly well on my prepared piece .. Wondering what this means for my grade . 
had an awesome night :) Sad to leave Boston in a couple hours but really happy to get home as well ! Should be a good break ! 
time to read a 13 < PROPFEMALE > article and write a paper on it by midnight . Am I ready ? You fucking bet I am . 
wants to stay 18 just a little longer . Hopefully 19 will equal or surpass this past year's awesomeness . 
to all of my awesome friends and family who have wished me happy birthday , I thank you dearly . I love you all . 
off to NYC to chill with < PROPFIRST > Burgess . :D 
homemade pita + amazing hummus = best snack in existence . 
Swedish words of the day : strömförsörjningskabeln , gränssnittskablarna , användarhandboken . 
Æbelskiver with nutella , strawberry jam , and cheddar + snow = happy < PROPMALE > . 
26 inches of fresh snow makes for beautiful photos , and gruesome shoveling . 
will be in the far north until the fourth . Any form of communication ( texts or calls ) would be appreciated to the utmost . 
is heading home tomorrow at last ! Then , to figure out what to do for the rest of break .. 
Back in Tuxedo ? Check . First semester complete with high GPA ? Check . 23 credits obtained . What ?? 
amp shopping . :D 
had an awesome day skiing at < PROPMALE > and then overloaded on Brats for dinner . Life is goood . :D 
iPhone is coming to Verizon :D 
Jari Mäenpää Wintersun Btw , finished all the \synchestrations\ " . ;) \ 
who wants to go to Metalfest 2011 in Germany this summer ? Anybody ?? The lineup looks incredible so far ! 
ear fatigue from mixing too long is the most disappointing phenomenon we cannot prevent .. lol 
RIP Valfar . <3 
STOP SENDING ME APPLICATION EMAILS BERKLEE , I FUCKING ATTEND THE COLLEGE ALREADY !!!!!!!!!!! >_> 
the shower is a GREAT place for writing folk metal melodies ! ;D 
leaving Tuxedo Park soon , back to Boston ! Break has been good but I'm ready to get back too :D 
back in Boston , long day .. People should get at me before I fall asleep lol 
:) 
hello , Peavey 6505+ combo , welcome to my arsenal ! xD 
Are You Experienced ? 
facebook + Safari = me not being able to like anything right now , lol . 
I WANT TIME TO COME OUT PLEASE 
Rubber Soulive is RIDICULOUS . Listen to it my friends ! 
I cannot wait for the new Moonsorrow album to come out . I think it will be delicious to the ears .. :D 
Breakfast/lunch/dinner ( whatever the meal I just ate can be considered ): buffalo chicken wrap , black bean burger with guacamole , bowl of chili and chips , and a waffle with scoops of chocolate chip cookie dough , cotton < PROPFEMALE > , vanilla , and black < PROPFEMALE > . Ujelly ?

MP&E app is nearly completed . :D 
having a great start to my Tuesday ! This semester is amazing xD 
any Berklee metalheads out there , divert your attention to this post : I will be playing with Aversed on the Ensiferum/Finntroll tour on February 27 . If you would like to go , buy a ticket from me ! 
slept for 11 hours , shit . Feelsgoodman though lol .

< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is the shit . 
thank you , St. < PROPFEMALE>'s jackhammers , for ending one more night of good sleep . I've needed it ! 
< PROPFIRST > Coltrane is the shit . 
has over 40 minutes of pretty solid epic metal ( not really sure of the subgenre ) written .. An album will be started when a few more songs are completed ! 
should be writing a three < PROPFEMALE > aesthetics paper that's due Friday .. Instead , writing/recording some orchestrated metal ideas . Fuck it . \\m/ 
somehow in my aesthetics paper , I managed to write \this is a restaurant\ " instead of \ " this is a question . \ " I think that says enough . " 
forgot how good it feels to sleep for 14 hours , because that was the first time i've ever slept for 14 hours . 
so , the winter could end any day now , how about that .. Sure seems like an appealing thought right now . 
Boloco satisfies late night hunger very , very , very adequately :D 
every single paper I have written in college thus far has received a B+ ( but somehow I got an A for last semester :S ) . I want a change !!!!!!

is done with his arranging midterm project at least !!! Fuck yeah ! Now I'm gonna go outside for the first time today . 
never thought I'd say this but so far the new Bodom is sounding pretty solid . :D 
thurssdays are not supppppposed to be this crazy . shit . 
alright , it's official . I actually like the new Bodom a lot . Solid songs , and anything they might lack is made up for by the incredible production quality . Not many metal albums come close to this clarity . It's a feast for the ears :3 
back in the tri-state , not doing much of anything for spring break and totally cool with it . 
going to see < PROPMALE > Di Meola tonight ! 
wow Di Meola . 
My Top 3 Weekly Last.fm artists : Cloudkicker ( 16 ) , < PROPFIRST > Townsend ( 12 ) & < PROPFIRST > Halen ( 3 ) http://bit.ly/eQHJEF 
just got back from a long , enjoyable day . Saw many people I haven't seen in a while , had some good food , and feeling good on top of it . Let's hope spring break stays interesting xD 
just sight read through the entire Giant Steps solo ( 220 bars ) for a warm up . Awful idea D: 
anybody want a 32gb iPod touch or a Fender Blues < PROPMALE > tube amp ? $240 and $300 respectively , both lightly used and in perfect working condition . 
My Top 3 Weekly Last.fm artists : Infected Mushroom ( 36 ) , < PROPMALE > Hedberg ( 23 ) & < PROPFIRST > McLaughlin ( 16 ) http://bit.ly/eQHJEF

cannot decide between food , shower , or nap . 
DONE WITH CLASSES , FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

anybody know of a coinstar or anything similar near Berklee ? 
one advantage of being out late : missing Berklee fire alarms ( which are inevitably always at night ) . 
officially has a Boston apartment for Sept . 1 , fuck yeah !!!! < PROPMALE > Curcio , get ready xD 
hungry for some nice hot food . Recommend me shit , Facebook . 
metal solo transcription ideas . Go . 
My Top 3 #lastfm Artists : < PROPMALE > Hicks ( 14 ) , DDM ( 9 ) & Amorphis ( 7 ) http://bit.ly/eQHJEF 
is it just me or do all metal guitarists have an obsession with writing solos that are almost too hard to play ?
