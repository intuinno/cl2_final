Is making life so hard for the photo taggers ... ^^ 
makes God cry

finally got that stupid book he has to read for school ... and still makes God cry . 
~ There's no surprise , check out my red eyes ~ 
~ The weather outside is frightful ... and the fire is ... sh*t , my house ! ~ 
~ When they come for me , I'll be sitting at my desk with a gun in my hand , wearing a bullet proof vest . Singing my , my , my ! How the time does fly ! When you know you're going to die by the end of night ~ 
Is it considered ... I don't know , conceited to \Like\ " your own status thing ? " 
It's funny how much a school project can affect you . Either way , I'm never getting married if I have to go through all this ! > < 
~ I was in the Farmer's Market with my so-called \girlfriend \"~" 
I choose you ! Labuffet ! 
I like how sometimes I think I'm trying too hard , when in reality I haven't done a damn thing that's productive . 
Introducing : < PROPFEMALE > , the Kicken Chicker ! 
just spent the last five minutes in the shower , wondering , \What the hell do I do now ? \"" 
Rah-rah-rah-ah-ah ! 
really , really likes the 1337 5|*3@| < feature 
Always hated being the elephant in the room . Never thought it could get any worse than that though . But then they started poaching < PROPFIRST > , and I'm left with nothing . 
A brother lost a brother A friend lost a friend A mother lost a son , but < PROPMALE>' soul will never end RIP < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , you were the constant inspiration to so many , and you always will be . 
My mother has told me , many a time , to get work done as soon as it's assigned . But where would I be now if I had ? I'd be sleeping ! ... I can't seem to admit that she was right . I just can't do it . 
Is it bad that I've already entered the part of Spring Break where I have no idea what to do ? 
A list of things that made this break pretty fun : Building an ampitheatre ; Making fun of the Clippers and < PROPFEMALE > in the same night ; Getting 9 CDs from Ameoba for $47 ; Blockbuster falling to the great Netflix , which allowed me to get things for cheap ; and finally , Blasting Lady Gaga in the car , windows down , at 11:30 at night , while being two male high school seniors . Summed up in two words : Fuck . Yes . 
Wake all the children from their slumber before they wonder why their dreams have gone to hell . Wake all the children from their sleep , down the staircase we shall creep , to the basement of this white-picket home . Let's show them where the bad ones go , for all they know , for all they know ... Their heroes are still untouchable , what they don't know , what they don't know ... 
\That's what she said . \ " Said the Joker to the Thief . " 
Sporadically making-up is kinda nice , but it's far too weird . Back to base 1 , which seems only natural . 
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes ? 
What happens to the Welcoming Committee when it's job is done ? 
Is a WHORE 
~ Therapy , I'm a walking travesty , but I'm smiling at everything . Therapy , you were never a friend to me , you can keep all your misery . ~ 
ATTENTION FACEBOOK PEOPLE : My Sister , Kaycie < PROPFEMALE > , has a serious problem . \ 
\ 
That is all . 
Farewell , Notre Dame ! I'll see ya down the road . \ 
Literally . 
My name is < PROPMALE > Sunshine Peterson , I am an adamant believer in the Flying Spaghetti Monster , and as of today , I am a high school graduate . Life is pretty alright . I love you all , and I give thanks to his glorious noodly goodness . 
Is so happy to be the catalyst that he is . And is even happier about the bittersweet feeling he gets as he has to step back , and eventually fade away . \ 
Don't read into that , it doesn't mean anything . P.S. , I still love you all . ... Duh . 
GOAL : Spend the next 4-6 hours listening to classical music and writing short stories/poetry . \ 
I at least owe that much to myself . 
In this big wide world , so full of people ... \ 
Each and everyone of them thinking\ 
\Why am I all alone ? \"" 
I apologize to everyone\ 
For everything that I have done\ 
These tragedies that I've begun\ 
That I always thought were harmless fun\ 
But life seems to have a way\ 
Of letting these things go astray\ 
And of course to my dismay\ 
I'm far too weak to even pray\ 
And I don't believe in many things\ 
My head is flooded and my chest stings\ 
I heard the snap of my heart strings\ 
But after all the Winters , there's still the Springs 
I really wanna teach my dog how to growl on command , so that even if there's a robber trying to get into my house , he'll have to do so with a lowered attack value . 
Really wants to play Shuffle Quiz right now ... 
I'm sorry for the unintentional things I've done that came from ignorance and blossomed into hatred . 
Just died by flying , screaming , skeletal heads . ... I think I'm done playing Dementium for a while . 
Can't sleep anymore\ 
Mudkips haunt my dreams , saying\ 
I herd u liek us 
... Nidorino . 
\How can I make myself happy ? \ " \ 
Prepare for unforseen consequences 
It was just a dream , just a moment ago ... 
Time : 6:16 PM\

I'm man enough to admit that I teared up during the Beatles cover in Glee .

I Feel Better 
Wants neon butterfly wings 
I think in the < PROPMALE > Potter universe , I'd literally be the only dickish person to come out of Hufflepuff . Darn you , conflicting quiz results . 
I'm seeing familiar faces in people I've never met . I miss you very much , ND Class of ' 10 . 
I solemnly swear that I'm not going to be like everybody else and have a post about Black Friday . \

I <3 < PROPFEMALE > Naddaf , a.k.a. My Best Friend for Life . =D 
I shall now tell the world ( Read : Facebook ) that in the future , I would like to have 6 to 7 tattoos and 10 to 12 piercings . Thank you for letting me waste your time with this status . =P 
I am almost certain that in the event of a zombie uprising , I'll be able to defend myself . I mean , I've got a green thumb the size of Texas and the lawn capacity for at least 45 plants . 
Damn you Science ! First Pluto , now this ... 
< PROPMALE > Sunshine Peterson : I am ... Chun Li . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Jay : You have giant thighs ! 
I've been listening to TiK ToK parodies for so long ... and I still haven't heard the original . I'm very proud of myself . 
Yeah ! Go Steelers ! ... Wait , what do you mean the game's over ? 
Ich bin der Übermensch !
