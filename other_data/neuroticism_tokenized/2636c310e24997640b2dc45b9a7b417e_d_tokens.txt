college is not healthy , need fencing to start 
19 is a weird age 
had philosophy class outside in perfect weather 
back in school , totally not cool 
time is my enemy 
gettin away for the weekend 
might be too excited for next semester's classes , but probably not 
hardly any time left in the semester yet so much to do 
j-town has never looked so beautiful 
... might have learned how to not procrastinate 
so close to being ready for the dogsledding trip ! physical fitness test- check ; required gear- check . now it's just boring paper work 
finally made it home . what a day ... 
Tron was surprisingly awesome . Still gotta see True Grit though . 
glad to be alive 
could not care less about the zodiac shift 
will have to make myself get a haircut in Richmond since I won't be going home until late May . This is quite a dilemma ...
