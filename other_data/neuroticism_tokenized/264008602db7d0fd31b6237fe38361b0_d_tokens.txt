teehee ... my husband is a college graduate ! 

can't wait for her day off . Worked everyday since Wednesday . 
is celebrating < PROPMALE>'s 22nd birthday =) 
is waiting for 3pm so I can go home ! 
LOVED the movie Defiance with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Go see it ! 
Can't wait to get off work to spend time with my brother- and sister-in law ! 
is at a friend's house on his teeny < PROPFEMALE > lenovo laptop . 
needs to move out of her apartment . So fed up with Western View Properties 
packed the first box last night ! Get our keys and start moving in the 14th ! 
4 more days until we get the keys to the new place ! So excited . 
Friday cannot come soon enough . Then we can have the keys to the new place and start moving in ! 
AHHHH ! Tomorrow needs to come faster ! 
Got the keys to the new place ! Sitting with my little neice waiting to leave for the catering job . 
watched Glee last night on Fox . Loved it ! Things going good in the new apartment . Takes about 5 minutes to walk to the main buildings of Chemeketa 
had a lot of fun hanging with Tiff yesterday ! 
has been married for a year 
Season premiere of House last night ... Loved it 
had a good weekend . Classes going ok so far . Looking forward to my desktop publishing class ! 
speech class is canceled . Was my only class for the day . Now , to hopefully find my books for cheaper from bookbyte ! 
is mourning the loss of her horse . Kat was 34 ! 
sitting in my InDesign class , not wanting to do this assignment . 
slightly studying for office management test . Yes , only slightly . It's bad >.< 
waiting for my access class to start 
ahhh , a day off from college =) 
Happy Thanksgiving to all . Hope everyone survives Black Friday as well . =) 
Anyone want to play Sorority Life with me ? =D Come join my house ^^ 
Just my finals left to do . Online classes all done . Can't wait until Christmas =) 
Breathe . 3 finals , 3 different days . Don't jump and dance in excitement over the last week of the term . 
* sigh * Back in Salem , back to class . Is Spring Break here yet ? 
Let's be honest : $51 for a workbook that you can't resell is ridiculous . Yes , we tear the pages out , but $51 ? COME ON ! It's a proofreading class ! On a better note , my business card I made for my desktop publishing class looks good I think =) 
saved almost $200 buying books directly from bookbyte.com instead of the college bookstore . AND bookbyte.com has their warehouse in Salem , so no shipping ! 
loves pretending to spazz on out < PROPMALE > for no reason at all =) 
Anyone have a ruffled lemur , a sloth , and a white tiger they can gift me in Zoo World ? Trying to complete a quest 
3 day weekend was nice . Looking forward to pestering my professor ( with my < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > , of course ! ) during my In-Design class tomorrow . Three hours in class doesn't look so bad ! 
Can't wait to see my brother- and sister-in-law ! 
had a good time with my brother- and sister-in-law last night . 
Feeling a bit better . Throat doesn't so much . 
Sore throat went away , but stuffy nose followed . What the heck ?! 
Umpqua Community College is coming on January 30 to play against Chemeketa Community College here in Salem and I plan on going to watch . Anyone down in Roseburg or Glide plan on coming up to watch them ? Maybe we can sit together if you are =) 
has a new love : Almond poppyseed muffins ! =) 
Job hunting is so frustrating . I've put in 7 applications and have heard back from only 1 ... online . Whatever happened to paper applications ? 
had an interview at Lenscrafters today . It's looking pretty promising ! 
I have the most wonderful husband . A beautiful < PROPFEMALE > necklace , a wonderful card , and delicious < PROPMALE > chocolate . A great < PROPFIRST>'s Day already ! 
Took a drug test yesterday as partof the hiring process for Lenscrafters . Manager said I really impressed them in the interview process . Everyone there seems friendly and it seems like it would be a fun place to work at . =) 
\Is Spring Break here yet ?... Nope ?... Then I'm going back to bed . \ " haha " 
I had a wonderful weekend =) 
Got a phone call from Lenscrafters ... They offered me the position ! Will hear from the manager about the training process . 
First day at Lenscrafters was today . I really like it . Everyone is so friendly =) Can't wait to go back Monday 
Such a beautiful day ! Had a nice time walking around Chemeketa's campus with my husband < PROPMALE > . If onl there were other pretty places to walk around in Salem . 
New shoes : check . New shirt : check . New pants : check . Smile : CHECK ! All ready to go to work for my second day ! =) 
Watching the guys perform on American Idol . Go < PROPFIRST > Lynche ! 
Stop tagging me in SIMS , Calendars , and Farmville photos . =/ 
Uggh , Monday's episode of House looks so good ! I can't wait . 
Drivers who have WHITE or BLUE headlights are stupid . Do you realize when it's dark out and you're behind me , your lights reflecting in my mirrors blind me ? =/ 
Mmmmm ... tomato soup with lots of crushed saltines sounds yummy . Too bad I am full from my dinner of mashed potatoes , gravy , and dinner sausage . =) 
ONE final next week . Looking forward to a break from school . 
DONE WITH FINALS ! Spring Break has started . Working tomorrow , and very excited ! =) 
Made bacon and french toast for me and my hubby . We \went camping\ " ... we slept in our sleeping bags on the floor of our spare room and played cards while we drank soda . We even had a \ " fire\ " to stay warm ... it was our heater haha . It was fun =) " 
I don't understand why there is a mob of Portland protestors . Yes , another man was shot by a policeman . The man had a WEAPON and refused to cooperate with police when they told him to stand down . The man kept advancing on the policeman with his weapon . The man got shot . Surprise , surprise . The policeman was doing his JOB by making sure the man didn't hurt anyone . 
Best thing about living in Salem ? Driving to the < PROPFIRST > Parkade , walking a few blocks to the capitol , and getting a tour of the rotunda ( beautiful ! ) , getting to see the House of Representitives and the Senate rooms ( did you know you can sit in while they vote on stuff ?! ) , and getting to walk the 121 circular stairs ( tiring ! ) . The people on the tour ? Just me , < PROPMALE > , and the tour guide . Yesterday was sweet ! 
Watched Hachi tonight . It is such a touching story ! If you haven't seen it already , do it ! =) 
Logged on to find a message saying someone from Thailand tried to access my account around 1:50 pm today . Changed my password , but if you have anything wierd on your wall , I apologize . 
My ham is baking , I have my potatoes cut and ready to boil , my pineapple/cranberry/jello is setting in the fridge . Waiting fo time to pass so I can boil my eggs , potatoes , gravy , and bake rolls . All of this for just me and my husband . I love making big dinners ! HAPPY EASTER ! 
My eyes were and are sooo puffy today . I'm taking a medication and cannot come into contact with alcohol . Guess what's in the lens cleaner at work ? Alcohol . Guess who got sick after using the lens cleaner and isopropanol to clean lenses at work ? Yeah . Can't wait to get off the meds . 
If you have a husband that makes you laugh , that you can say is your best friend , who you want to grow old with , who you know will always be there to pick you up when you are feeling down , who is your world , and a man that you can thank God every night for . Copy and Paste this to your profile with your anniversary date ...... September 13 , 2008 . Love you < PROPMALE > =) 
Worked most of this weekend , but still had fun spending time what time I did with my sister-in-law , her husband , and my 16 month old niece =) 
12 days until I turn 20 ... 377 until I turn 21 . YESSSS !!!! 
What os the point of having Chemeketa Elearn and My Chemeketa email if the professor doesn't use it to tell us class is canceled ? Luckily I live behind campus instead of having to commute to class . 
is going to be 20 in a week . Not long until I can go to a bar with my husband , even if I am not buying alcohol . I hear bar food is good ^^

Thanks to everyone who sent me birthday wishes . =) I tried to comment back , but there were so many ! I am blessed to know all of you . 
can't wait for Spring term to be over . Would rather be working at LensCrafters than going to class . 
is in love with Celtic Thunder ! Look them up and listen , they are amazing ! 
With summer around the corner , do you have a good pair of sunglasses ? Wearing sunglasses helps protect your eyes from the harmful effects of UV rays . Polarized lenses are better , but get a good pair of sunglasses ! 
Oh my ... jus listened to Summer Girls by LFO , which led me to listen to the Backstreet Boys , which led to NSYNC , which led me to ... other 90's songs . * sigh * Good times . 
Just watched Ponyo by Hayao Miyazaki . It was so adorable ! 
Dear 10 o'clock Fox 12 news : I have been waiting 30 minutes for a certain news story . I am tired and you haven't talked about it since you gave us the teaser at the beginning . Your morning news with < PROPFEMALE > Grauert , < PROPMALE > Ferryman , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > with weather is better . Good night . * click * 
Series finale of 24 was AMAZING ! Glad it turned out how it did , instead of the way I thought it was going to =/ 
For my East Coast friends : American Idol has not showed here on the West Coast . Please STOP revealing things about it =/ 
Wow , < PROPFEMALE > Bowersox and Alanis Morisette . They sound so much alike ! What a good duo on Idol tonight ! 
Went camping last night at Detroit Lake . It's hard to start a fire when the sky decides to rain on our firewood and what little fire we had going . =/ 
One final tomorrow ... at 8 a.m. Hopefully I am awake enough to pass my Advanced Document Production final . You would think typing a letter and memo would be easy , right ? O.o 
drove down to Roseburg Monday . Have neer driven that far on I5 . Watched my littel brother graduate from 8th grade . Brought my brother up with me today . He will be spedning two weeks with me and < PROPMALE > ! =) 
had a great time on my brother-sister day yesterday ! Visited our grandmother , grabbed some food at Sonic , acted like little kids at Toys R Us , danced like dorks to a song in my car in the parking lot of Walmart . It was fun ^^ 
Another day at LensCrafters . =) 30% off complete pair of glasses and 40% off sunglasses with the featherwate polarized lens . Good sale ! 
Loves arguing with my husband over who loves who more =D 
* sigh * Wished my father-in-law and step-dad a happy father's day . Wish my father was alive to wish him a happy father's day . =( 
My 18 month old niece is running around in a green tinkerbell dress/nighty with tinkerbell slippers and a headband . She is so adorable ! =) 
Ok , the tinkerbell outfit got soaked ... on to the < PROPFEMALE > and the Frog set ! < PROPMALE > is so adorable =) 
I love summer . The smell of a barbecure , the taste of ribs , family ge t-t ogethers . My favorite time =) 
Sat on my mother-in-law's kitchen floor with my niece with a plate of cut up strawberries and ate them with her while she told me a story ... in her baby-babbling =) 
What do you mean it's already Friday ? I had a great time here in Roseburg ! Packing up to go back to Salem . My husband turns 23 today ! Happy birthday < PROPMALE > ! 
I love working with < PROPFEMALE > Hansen and < PROPFIRST > Lute ! < PROPFIRST > Lute 
Has made the dicision to study for the November ABO test . I thought I would be getting one book to study from . Manager handed me 7 different books and 133 flash cards ! I sure have my work cut out for me . Optician's license , here I come ! =) 
* sigh * I wish < PROPMALE > Petty would come to Portland . I would definitely buy tickets ! 
So excited . After I get off work , < PROPMALE > and I are going out for dinner and seeing Avater The last Airbender , which plays at 9:40 pm tonight ! I love dating my husband =) 
Went to Cinnebar with the hubby last night and saw Avatar , The Last Airbender . It was great ! They totally set it up for a sequel ! After we got out of the movie , some guy stopped us and told < PROPMALE > he had an awesome mustache ! It was hilarious =) Date night started off bad ( the mall closes at 8pm , so we didn't get to go to the place we wanted ) , but overall , it was great . 
Had a good time hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > Bebb , < PROPFIRST > Badgett , and their pup < PROPFIRST > . Picked so many blueberries yesterday ! This winter we will have lots of yummy frozen fruit to eat . 
Someone hacked my email this morning while I was asleep and sent EVERYONE on my address list an email with a link . Checking every website I visit to see if any of my other accounts were hacked 
Oh . My . Gosh . I LOVE the Lego store at Washington Square ! Picked up a bunch of pieces to use for building things . What batter way to make a relationship stronger than by building a town together ? =) 
Had a GREAT day yesterday . Went movie hunting at FYE and found a collectors set of Aladdin , which contained a platinum 2 disk edition of the movie , the making of Aladdin , and character portraits for $24.99 ! Then < PROPMALE > out with our friends < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > and got to go to my first drive-in movie in < PROPFIRST > ! They played Sorcerer's Apprentice and Knight and Day . Both were great ! Didn't get to bed until 3 a.m. though haha 
Already been up for 7 hours , and I still have to work from 12pm-7pm . Just got back from taking my mother-in-law to the Portland Airport . Man , is PDX huge ! My first time at an airport haha 
Got Clear internet today and a wireless router . Now I can sit in my apartment and play on the internet without it dropping ! =) 
It's nice to have a day off , but now that < PROPMALE > is working , I don't have anyone to spend it with . * sigh * Well , at least I can clean the apartment and play on the internet while he is away . 
I hate spiders . I especially hate them when they are on my ceiling and I have no thing that will effectively squish them . Luckily , I have hairpsray . He fell behind my clock and I haven't seen him yet . Hopefully , he's dead . Off to clean my apartment while my laundry is going ! 
REALLY wants the new Mazda 2 in that SWEET green color ^^ Or a house . Either would be nice 
Had a wonderful time celebrating our 2 year wedding anniversary yesterday . Went to McGrath's Fish House for dinner and had endless prawns . < PROPMALE > liked the Coconut Prawns , and I was more favorable to the teriyaki prawns , though the Parmesan prawns were delicious , too ! Can't wait to see what the next year brings . =) 
Surprised my hubby with the new < PROPFIRST > Hood movie . We watched it while we had dinner ( lime chicken , rice , and a salad ) . He liked it =) I feel like a good wifey 
We get our new furniture today ! Well , everything except for the lamps . =/ But a new sofa , loveseat , a glass-top coffee table , and matching glass-top endtables ! So excited . 
LOVE our new furniture . Went to Target and Pier 1 to find some nice coasters , but coudn't find any I liked enough . Did come out with 2 nice candles and candle holders to put on the cofee table =) 
FINALLY done with homework . Spent more on my books thank I wanted , but Bookbyte saved me money once again =) 
Made a delicious dinner of lemon pepper and < PROPFEMALE > chicken , white chedder shells pastaroni , a side salad , and for dessert I made banana cream pudding with vanilla wafers and sliced bananas . It was wonderful ! 
My chorus class is doing < PROPFEMALE > by Vivaldi right now . The entire score . One of the movements is Domine Fili Unigenite . Any old GHS choir members remember that song ? ;-) 
Can't wait until I can see my sister again ! And my neice < PROPMALE > ^^ 
LOVE my husband . He surprised me with some pretty flowers at work , then gave me Avenged Sevenfold's newest cd when we got in the car . =) Can't stop smiling ! 
We FINALLY started going over Domine Fili Unigenite in Choir today . Didn't take me too long to get back into it . I still have most of it memorized . Just need to fine tune it ! =) And Ave Verum Corpus by Mozart : Absolutely beautiful . 
Painting my nails black and orange while listening to Vivaldi's Domine Deus . I want to know that song inside and out when I audition for the solo in choir =) It's a BEAUTIFUL soprano part , especially when paired with a violin . 
Off to watch Hellcats , then to bed for classes tomorrow . Exciting ! 
Working on my electronic calculators homework in the library . 
Dear stomach : stop feeling like crap ! We have work tomorrow >.< 
Received my paperwork telling where and what time I take my Optician's test ! Only 16 days until I take it . 
Was canceled on by my Payroll group ... AGAIN . this does not bode well for the group payroll project ... 
Went to dinner at Round Table tonight . There was a guy who did balloon animals and other stuff . He made me a Ninja Turtle . It is AWESOME ! Pics up soon . 
Wow ... I got to sleep in until 9 a.m. , ate breakfast at 10:30 , and am just now going to take a shower . Know how long it's been since I got to do that ? Quite a while . I feel great ! Now , to go be productive ... 
5 days until my Optician's test . Feeling the stress . 
* sigh * Wish I had done better in Geometry and my other math classes . I wouldn't have had to spend so much time on prisms . 4 days until my Optician's test ! 
Feels really good about my Optician's test . Won't know how I did for about six to eight weeks . >.< Now , I can focus more on my schoolwork ! 
Me ( while talking about Bing vs . Google ): \I'd rather be Google'd than Binged ! \"" 
Chemeketa Community College is closed all day because of snow . Now , I can get caught up on my homework ! 
Walked outside to pick up the mail I haven't checked in a couple days . It was so cold outside ! As soon as I got inside , my glasses fogged up ! How lovely =) 
Hmm , I think it's bedtime . I've been up since 3am . 
Mmmmm < PROPFIRST > in the box tacos . One of the best cheap dinners for college students since chips and salsa ^^ 
Tripped on the stairs at choir rehearsal and hurt my knee . Nothing broken or cracked , but it hurts really bad . =/ 
Two more classes and a choir performance and I am DONE with this term ! 
Hmmm ... I'm actually kind of sad Fall term is over . I need to plan Winter term out 
Went to dinner at Thai Orchid with some friends . I decided on the Pad Thai . It . was . DELICIOUS ! It tasted as good as the Pad Thai my mom's Thai friend made us years ago . <3 And it was reasonably priced for the amount of food you got 
Saw Burlesque tonight . Amazing . I totally want that movie . >.< 
Anyone know how I can stop receiving notifications on Facebook when someone send me a request for a game ? It's pretty annoying to log on to 20 notifications and all of them being \_____ sent you a request in Frontierville/Sorority Life/Castle Age\ " etc . " 
waiting to get the keys to the new house . Feeling better , though my voice sounds real husky . I hope it comes back soon . 
wants to wish everyone a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Got the keys to our new house and are loving spending time with family . <3 
Is pretty much completely moved into the new house ! All of the furniture is in , just a few tidbits left in the apartment <3 
Spent 25 minutes this morning looking for a parking spot at Chemeketa . I'm glad they are building a new building for the nursing students , but while they are at it , can they add more parking ? Please ? =) 
Doing online Business Homework ... why is the website taking forever to load things ? 
Happy the Ducks made it tot he BCS , sad that they lost . </3 
Smells like bleach and Comet , but finished cleaning the apartment ! Just need to turn in the keys and we will be done there =) 
Freakin ' passed my ABO ! Which means I am now a licensed Optician <3 
Aerosmith's Dream On ... awesome . Glee's version ... good too . Not sure which version I like better . The version I grew up listening to with my parents ? Or the remake ? Hmm ... 
\Show me a piano falling down a mineshaft and I'll show you A-flat minor\ " bahaha " 
Hey American Board of Opticianry , where's my license you are supposed to send me for passing ? =P I am getting anxious to hold it ! 
REALLY hates when people are in such a rush they pass others in a SCHOOL ZONE . I don't care if the speed limit past the school zone is 55 mph , you can wait . 
Super excited about going to Washington Square with < PROPFIRST > Lute ! It's going to be a blast =) 
Had a GREAT time visiting Sunglass Hut ( all 3 of them ! ) and LensCrafters with < PROPFIRST > Lute at the Washington Square Mall yesterday with our anniversary vouchers . Can't wait to see her < PROPFEMALE > sunglasses and for my RayBan sunglasses ( with the awesome RayBan Rox lens ! ) to come in ! 
OMG ! Super excited about going to see Avenged Sevenfold and Stone Sour in concert this Sunday ! Will have to book it to get down to < PROPFIRST > in time from Salem , but it's my first real concert ! 
Concert last night was AWESOME ! Avenged Sevenfold put on one heck of a show , loved getting to watch Stone Sour , Hollywood Undead was good , and New Medicine opened ! I got New Medicine's cd , signed by one of the guys , and the lead singer also signed my ticket and gave me a hug ^^ 
Got my new nametag today ! It says :\ 
Alyssa\

Well , just my final for my online psychology in the workplace and the final on Tuesday and I am FINISHED with this term . 3 months until graduation ! 
Scratch that last post --- just my final on Tuesday and I am finished with this term . <3 
Done with this term . Can't wait until Sunday when I go down to Roseburg to pick up my little brother and bring him to Salem for all of next week ! 
Cleared my junk folder in my email , and I couldn't help but laugh at one called \PMP Certification\ " . All I could think of was \ " Do they want me to be a certified pimp ? \"" 
Had a good time visiting my Mom this weekend . Brought my little brother up for the week . Aaaaaaand my Optician's license came in ! now , to get a nice frame for it =) 
Had to drop chorus since I can't attend rehearsals for a play outside of class time . Couldn't get into a lot of classes I wanted since they were full . Soooo , I get to take Principals of Marketing online . Thrilled . NOT ! 
It felt sooo good to go for a run today in the neighborhood around our house . My legs are already sore , but it'll be worth it =) 
Went to Perfect Look and had 4 inches cut off my hair ! I also bought a box of hair dye and made it more of a reddish-brown . Pictures coming soon . 
I realize that my hair dye instructions say it's best not to shampoo your hair for 24 hours after coloring , but I am NOT going to class without a shower haha . I do not own a shower cap =P Besides , it's been about 22 hours since I colored it . Close enough ? I think so . 
Seriously Chemeketa , why would you take elearn down ? Don't you know I need to do my homework ? 
Started working at Eye Focus NW ( doctor's office next to LensCrafters ) , and I have to say I like it . I like learning new things ! Checking in patients , pretesting visual acuity , using the autorefractor , all of it is nice . 
Hit a squirell on my way to work today . I felt so sorry for the little critter ! He looked scared standing in the middle of Center Street , and then he ran under my car . I wanted to cry when I got to work . =/ 
Greatly dislikes keyboarding classes . I doubt my employer will ever fire me for not typing with the proper fingers as long as I get my job done . Besides , I can type WAY faster doing it my way !
