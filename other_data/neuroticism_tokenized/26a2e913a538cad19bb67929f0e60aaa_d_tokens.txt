Q : Hey /tr/ , where do Pokémon Centers get their funding from ? \ 
Government ? Do adult trainers have to pay , but the main character of the games don't because they're kids ? Does your Mom actually foot the bill ? \ 
Wingull boat unrelated , but awesome . \ 
A : Pokemon centers are for people participating in the Pokemon league challenges , Advertising , PPV events and ticket revenue is what pays for the centers .

Working on something crazy on MS Paint . 
Very hungry yo , too bad it's a bad idea to eat this late . 
So I went to the kitchen to look for some food to eat , as I went to the fridge to grabed a few things to microwave .. BAM ! There it was . A bag of Mc Donnalds . * Chew Chew * 
Seriously . What the fuck is a G6 ? 
MUST MAKE MOAR SPRITES . 
Pew Pew 
For my birthday I want frickin sharks with with frickin laser beams attached to their backs ! 
So in Japan the Elite Four is called \The Four Heavenly Kings\ " . Indeed it proves the point that Japan gets all the better stuff . " 
Sometimes when I am really bored , I like to walk around or indoors as well , enjoying the view of modern technology and pretening I'm hanging out with someone from like 200 years ago explaining it all to them . 
I just developed Gastroenteritis ... I feel horrible and might not able to go to school tomorrow . I hope my virus goes away soon ..

If a person is born deaf , what language do they think in ? 
/vp/ > /b/ Nuff said . 
I really hate the VGAs . It's really a popularity contest where the reason a few gamers ( as in the casual ones , where the normal ones are most likely playing online at the time ) would watch this is for the new trailers . It's basically a bunch of commercails within a commercal . The VGAs are nothing without those trailers . 
Just woke up , my sister overslept , and my mom thinks it's saturday . Fuck yes . 
Holy shit , I totally forgot I had Final Fantasy XIII . Fuck you Reach I am going back to Cocooooonnnnnnnn !!!!!!!!!!!! 
I kinda have a epiphany today . I notice that I am starting to lose interest in american based games and becoming more interested in Japanese gaming . I have a Xbox and the past 3 years I've played Halo , Call of Duty and many other popular games for the console like Gears , GTA 4 and many others , but for some reason I just lost interest in them . I bearly touch my Xbox anymore . So Should I sell my Xbox to get a Wii ? 
Any plans anyone would like me to join in ? 
Wonder Showzen was the only reason MTV2 was ever good at the time .
