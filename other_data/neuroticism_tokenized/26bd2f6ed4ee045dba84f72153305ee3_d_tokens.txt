realized just how nerdy of a childhood he had after sorting through a closet-full of microscopes , rack-mount servers , model rockets , homemade pH paper , half a spectrometer , and some sort of device made out of construction paper and glow-in-the-dark crayon that says \UV Dosimeter\ " on it . " 
Putting poster tack on your face is a horrible idea . Never do it . 
Normal people confuse me severely 
If you use Facebook Places , you should turn off \ 
the \show me to people nearby\ " setting . It can be exploited to allow total strangers to track you . "

saw TONS of whales today . 
just discovered Hydra 0_0 
saw Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog for the first time . It was literally > 9000 types of epic . 
How to do homework like Nathan :\ 
1 . Realize that the assigment would be easier to read if it was OCR'd\ 
2 . Spend an hour trying to find an appropriate OCR utility\ 
3 . Write a small utility to flip the PDF files since the OCR software can't read them sideways\ 
4 . Profit ?

To do tonight : Finish my AMIGOS sup application and figure out how to make the Scientific Method into a halloween costume 
Ended up falling into a bog , tearing his jacket on a particularly aggressive tree , and getting hit with in the face with various objects until he threw up Night Mythos = much less fun than regular Mythos

Dear MIND Institute :\ 
While we all appreciate a spirit of scientific curiosity , I do believe that \what does it feel like to have your brain explode\ " is not an appropriate research question . \
