Silence is not < PROPFEMALE > , it is crimson . When no words are spoken , hearts cannot be healed . Eventually shattered lives are all that remain . soft hearted and pure Built a brick wall ( repeled the only one i wanted to climb it ) drowning in filth No shovel to dig myself out sinking into waste wasted time and wasted self - thrown away , now only refuse heart and soul refused But not returned to me ? instead- thrown in the sewr 
Silence is not < PROPFEMALE > , it is crimson . When no words are spoken , hearts cannot be healed . Eventually shattered lives are all that remain . 
When you step out the door at six in the morning and see the beautiful day taking shape , its hard to make yourself go back inside and attmpt sleep .

Don't rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth . Only you can be responsible for that . If you can't love and respect yourself - no one else will be able to make that happen . Accept who you are - completely ; the good and the bad - and make changes as YOU see fit - not because you think someone else wants you to be different .  ~ Stacey Charter ~ ( thx august )

My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores , go to school . They gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job and work for the things that I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school , at my job & to take pride in my work . I fought but I grew up with morals , a good work ethic & respect for the law and my elders . I thank God every day for my parents .
