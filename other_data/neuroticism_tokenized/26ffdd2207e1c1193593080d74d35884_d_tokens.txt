I had the best time today and I need to thank , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > sy for taking me to a place that where I enjoyed every giggle , but still I wonder ... how is that purple ..... used ? I look forward to many more trips like this , and yes < PROPFEMALE > , next time we will wait for you ! 
Everyone arrived a few hours ago , safe and sound and tired , we got the marriage license , and I got the key to the reception place . Tonight I reclaim my house ! I am so happy right now .... my little girl is home ! 
My ex-husband called me last night at 11 when they arrived at their motel and asked ME to iron his and his son's clothes .... not can we borrow your iron ? amid the many other things the m-o-b has to do today ... well .. I am riding my motorcycle today and I can't wait to see what they look like after that ride ...... NOT , but it was a nice picture anyway ... not sleeping well ... bride and groom are NERVOUS ! Much to do , 
It just gets better and better ..... ;) my ex sister in law , is upset not to be sitting at a table near the front and doesn't want to sit with the common folk ... can someone explain that to me .. Of course < PROPFEMALE > came up with the seating chart and heard the complaint ... Ahhh well , I did this for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and to hell with all the people who show up at the last minute to critique ... Sue and I have made it glow ! 
The wedding is over the cleanup is done ( well almost ) . Everything was as I hoped , except some of the people ( LOL ) , and oh yeah .. summer arrived ... THANK YOU < PROPFEMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > !!!! Ppl had great things to say about the food , and decor ... ( we met for breakfast this morning ) the heat hurt their appetites . As for the rest , I have plenty of stories to tell ... I made the two ppl happy that were most important ... ALL I HOPED FOR ! 
so now we prepare to say goodbye ... I can endure anything but this .. 
the pictures of < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s wedding are AWESOME !!!!!!!! Will post some later when < PROPFEMALE > talks me thru it ! 
WOW ... as soon as < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > have had a < PROPMALE > to look , I will let everyone know where to go and look .... Kirk and I cried all over again ... I am in awe of < PROPFEMALE > Ruff and the way she capture people and the day ! 
trying to keep track of who is on what side ... never been this confused before ... 
Presentation today for K-12 staff on behavior ... wondering why I volunteered to help with this ? Oh yeah , because I am CRAZY ! 
Proud : I am growing as a presenter .... The school loved what we ( well I wrote the presentation believing I wasn't speaking ) gave them and I was able to ad lib ... something new for me , since crowds , speaking in front of people scare the HELL out of me ... but hey ... 
I am a bit late , but .... No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . We are only as strong as the weakest among us . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
Going to < PROPFEMALE>'s to help study this morning 
< PROPFEMALE > you are next for licensure ... then we can study behavior and make lots and lots of money or become famous , or just be good at what we do ... Oh wait , we already are good at what we do ... anyway .... 
Why does it have to be Monday already ??? 
WOO HOO < PROPFEMALE > got her first Massage job ... part time right now , but she gave the boss a massage and earned her job !!!!! so seriously cool for her ! 
Ithaca today , and it is a beautiful , but < PROPFEMALE > day ... wedding reception tomorrow .... Looking forward to beautiful days 
okay , so the weather didn't cooperate today , the closer to Ithaca we got the cloudier it became , but at least the rain was light when it finally did come down . The bands were great , the wine was even better ;)

is heading to the gym ... 
< PROPMALE>'s dad is doing better -- looks like it was a bleeding ulcer , but drs say he lost half his blood volume ... kirk said 5 pts later he is speaking and awake ..... crossing our fingers ! 
What a beautiful day ! 
Going to get a flu shot and my haircut ... Kirk should be back tomorrow . Except for the fact that the dog is watching out the window and missing him , all is calm 
Aerobics at 1 today .... hope I survive my first day . 
Saratoga Springs was a beautiful place to visit , but next time lets do it for FUN ! 
Why do men get to hold in their frustrations , and then whine about why they HAVE to hold them in ? Like a badge of honor or something . For all this talk about them being the stronger sex , it is BULL ... and no I am not JUST coming to that conclusion , but .... Buck up and deal with it !!!! The Hammer speaks ... 
losing my computer for maintenance today , hope it comes back real soon ... :) 
Woo-Hoo , my computer is back .... 
Spent the day at a CPSE/CSE chairperson training , only to come out to the parking lot and find a ticket .. You'd think I would have seen that sign ...., So I will wait until the day before it is due and pay it ... 
aerobics this afternoon ... ;) 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > for making me look good today !! I thought the dance was a great touch and I look forward to next week and doing it again .... ;)

It was a beautiful wedding ! < PROPFEMALE > dancers came and entertained us , bag pipe music welcoming the guests , there was so much food for appetizers and dessert it was hard to choose .... Erina was BEAUTIFUL 
going to albany today to protest cuts the governor is proposing . When our legislators , senators , assemblymen etc ... take a good look at themselves , their spending habits in their job and their salaries ... we might really save what the governor now says is still over 3billion+ in debt after all the HUGE cuts he has already forced on us . It should start TOP DOWN , not with the weakest- the people I work for . 
I am thankful for ..... < PROPFEMALE > who has helped me in overcoming 
Today , I am thankful for my friends , every one of them . Those I know and those I have yet to know . 
Today I am thankful for the journey , even if I don't always understand the twists and turns . 
Today , I am thankful for cellphones ! < PROPMALE > let me know they arrived safe in Philly at 12:15 and < PROPFEMALE > could call me at 2:30 ( while in an ambulance ) this morning to help her thru a scary situation with her friend .... 
Today , I am thankful for my queen-size bed . It allows my dog plenty of space to stretch out , stay warm and rest comfortably . Well and she allows me to be there too ! 
< PROPMALE > says that < PROPMALE > has 15 callbacks out of 33 from places like , wilimena , mtv , elite , < PROPMALE > , click , etc etc etc ... who knew talent like that was in < PROPFEMALE > ? Wonder where it goes from here ? 
Today I am thankful that when < PROPFEMALE > says ' pull that belly button in toward your spine ' after 3 years , I ACTUALLY CAN FEEL IT !!! 
The belly button that is -- and that is PROGRESS

This morning , I am thankful it is friday 
I am thankful today for NO MIGRAINE !!! to start the day ... 
Today I am thankful for < PROPFEMALE > , because 1 day was all I got ... Is there anyone out there ( besides < PROPFEMALE > ;) who would switch with me and have a few migraines ??? No ?? That's okay it will pass ... and it is aerobics day ... so there is something else to be thankful for ! 
Today , I am thankful for what < PROPFEMALE > wrote last night ... Part 1 - Every day , think as you wake up , Today I am fortunate to have woken up , I am alive , I have a precious human life , I am not going to waste it . I am going to use all my energies to develop myself to expand my heart out to others , to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings . 
Today I am thankful that I don't have to go back to work until Monday and that after yesterday I am done with .... 
Today I am thankful to < PROPFEMALE > when she posted this .... Part 2 - I am going to have kind thoughts towards others , I am not going to get angry , or think badly about others . I am going to benefit others as much as I can . - Dalai Lama ( I forgot to post it yesterday ) 
Today , I am most thankful for the history that brought us to this day , for the freedom to be free and for those who protect our freedoms . I am truly blessed . 
Headin to the gym .... looks like tonight at the park is going to be a C-C-C-O-L-D one ! The weather reports that there is a high wind warning starting at 7pm . < PROPMALE > and I are set to take over from < PROPMALE > at Otsinigo at 7 ... but I am excited to do this 
Last night was a lot of fun .. and busy ! :) Seriously , the hard work that was put into this lights show can't be put into words . When we drove thru and I listened to < PROPMALE > tell me about this one and the trouble they had with that one ... ALL the displays ( more than last year ) , I can't wait to take another trip around . Hats off to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > ...!!!!!! I hope you need me again ! 
I have a question for anyone . How much do babysitters make an hour ? and when you tell your babysitter you will be back in 3 hours , do you call them if you are going to be later ? This is a bit more complicated than my questions , but I need some input . I need to help my daughter feel less taken advantage of and more able to deal with the situation .... HELP !!!!! 
Okay waking up with a migraine is no fun , but designing the medicine so that there are rebound migraines is just plain (*&^ ! Why can't the meds just take the pain away without side effects ? Why do I get to feel better ( THANKFULLY ) only to wake up the second day with another ? These are the great mysteries in my life ... one I am searching for an answer for .... 
Okay , creme brulee is in the oven ... crossing my fingers . It wasn't really that hard . BUT it said to take out the vanilla bean and save it . Save it for what ? It was cooked in heavy cream ... so < PROPFEMALE > , I hope I did it right .. I will know in about 1/2 hour ! 
Heading to aerobics soon .. and catching a cold as well 
I think I coughed up a lung this morning ... my ribs hurt 
Very happy to have just gotten a call and don't have to drive to < PROPFEMALE > Valley-Springfield this morning !

In memory of family and friends who have lost the battle of cancer and the ones who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > if you know someone who has or had cancer ? . Dear God , I pray for the cure of cancer . Amen . ( 93% won't copy and paste this , will you ? ) 
I had a long , long , long snowy ride home . The closer I got to home , the worse it snowed too ... Baby shower tomorrow , so it has to stop ! 
It is so cold outside ... I am considering a move to a warmer climate .... soon ! 
Right now it is 5 above , up from 3 below earlier so it is a warming trend at the moment . Got some snow in the forecast for tonight and tomorrow ... 
Ladies , your red , black , pink , blue , white , butterflied , cheetah printed , and clear bra colors made the news tonight . Facebook doesn't know who started it going but the < PROPFEMALE > B Komen foundation says it was a great way to raise awareness for breast cancer . Way to go ! Post this on your wall if you participated in the Bra Color Game ! :) Thanks for sharing this ! 
Wow , ( no offense here to my friends that smoke ) , but I was in a house in Binghamton where the smell of smoke was SO BAD ( 3 heavy smokers , + a smoker downstairs ) , I think I inhaled 2 packs while there for an hour and a half .... SO glad I do not smoke anymore !!! 
Met a family in < PROPFEMALE > Valley today , and the trip was beautiful ( long , but the view was worth it ) , the child however ..... well , I can see why the HS is having trouble with him ..... Mom is overwhelmed . I was even a little jumpy when I left .... 
? (?????) ? Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for it because You Can't Fix Stupid ; but we can raise awareness of it . 93% won't Copy and Paste this . 
I had lunch with an iPod in your bathroom because I am cool like that 
Cooper's seafood house in Scranton is EXCELLENT !!! and < PROPMALE > may be looking at a 4-wheeler for serious . The man surprises me all the time ... 
took my big doggie to the vet ( 4th time since December 28th ) and had to leave her . Vet says that since anti-biotic isn't working after all this time ... well she prepared me that she is thinking it could be bone cancer .... She is a rottie , my big doggie and well , I thought hip problems were the biggest thing I had to worry about , but turns out ... no . My heart is breaking , 
If you are a parent with the greatest kid(s ) on earth then copy and repost this and let's give all our kids the recognition they deserve . I am proud of my children and I thank God for them ! 
NOT good news at the vet . What I feared is true , my < PROPFEMALE > dog has cancer .... they think it has metasticized to the lungs ... If so ( and a radiologist will verify ) , we have about no time at all . She is my protector , my child , my friend and I am not ready to let go . 
Albany bound to protest those nasty nasty cuts our blind governor wants to make on the people who can least afford it . Wonder how he would feel on the other end of the cuts ? 
Well , today I met a 4 year old who's pediatrician , mom and others ( not staff at the preschool , though ) would like him diagnosed with a mood disorder ........ HE'S 4 ! 
I cannot post my urbandictionary definition ..... My name sucks ! 
wherever it lands 
My < PROPFEMALE > dog went to sleep like the brave soul that she was . while my heart is breaking , I am comforted by the fact that she is no longer in pain . 
< PROPMALE>'s dog Scrappy is mourning < PROPFEMALE > . It is really awesome and sad to watch . I found < PROPFEMALE>'s rawhide bone today . Scrappy saw it and let out this mournful howl ... I dropped the bone ( I was crying of course ) and Scrappy picked it up and took it to my bedroom where < PROPFEMALE > always slept ... She laid it down , looked at the bone and looked up at me and sighed . 
I still need help with my stable ... everything but the bricks ... HELP ! 
Tonight I held the sweetest , cutest and tiniest little boy . He just felt < PROPFEMALE > , he is probably 7lbs or so ... but oh so cute . This was the happiest I have been since Friday night . Thank you < PROPMALE > ! Next time ... though could you save the diaper changes for Daddy ;) 
So , will we or won't we ? I would seriously like the snow to miss us ... 
Okay , I just gotta say , we got a LOT of snow and 2 people have already run off the road right in our upper yard of my house . We just spent the last hour and a half digging one guy out and another idiot who must have never lived on this road before put puts up the road and bingo ... in the ditch .... ;) We of course have a state of emergency in chenango county , so unnecessary travel ... In other words STAY HOME 
As I look out my windows at how beautiful it looks , I then realize that there is a LOT of *^%% snow . Still a state of emergency here in Chenango , haven't seen a plow since 6:45 last night ... Time to shovel ! 
Wow we have been shoveling for 3 hours .. We had snow to my knees , so I guess we got 2 feet . I need a nap and one of < PROPFEMALE>'s brownies !!!! 
Going to Donoli's for dinner .... Free at last from the snow ! Then I get to play card shark ( ha ha ) and go to my pitch tournament .... can we win tonight ???? We'll see ... ;) 
< PROPFEMALE > where do you find these things ??? OK I ADMIT IT ... IMMA B*TCH ! Unfortunely most women won't repost this . = make mistakes , I'm outta control , @ times I'm hard to handle-But if u can't handle me @ my worst , then u sure as hell don't deserve me at my best . If ur a b*tch then post this as ur status .. I DARE U ! =o )))

is Cancer Awareness Month . I am posting this in MEMORY of every cancer \ 
patient , family member and friend who lost their battle with cancer and \ 
in HONOR of those who continue to conquer it ! Post this if you love \ 
someone who has or had cancer . 
Training all this weekend , < PROPFEMALE > ! but what it will do for my toolbox in helping people PRICELESS ! 
Last day of training in Oneonta ... been a great experience , gotten more out of this then some before . + 15 CEU's and I will be certified to use what I am learning !! 
Spent the weekend training and now I go to the gym and continue thru the week ! 
I need some migraine reliever ideas from anyone ! I keep waking up with them . The anitbiotic worked , but now I am done taking it . I take Zyrtek every day , but that doesn't seem to be keeping the allergy symptoms at bay . It is hard to function this way and I HATE MISSING THE GYM ! HELP ! 
It is snowing here right now ... 
okay , no migraine today ( YEA !! ) , Day off ( woohoo ) I should go to the gym and make it an even better day ! So off I go

Da%n cars ! Can't go to the gym this morning , gas tank strap broke on my car , just as < PROPMALE > was backing it into the driveway ( I had him drive it to see what the noise was !!! ) So today , I get to be driven to work and picked up ..... UGH !! But it could be worse , it could have broken when I drove to Owego , or when we go to VT on Friday ... 
wants her car back ! 
Okay , so I have my car back ... but only one side of the gas tank part came in ( strap ) < PROPMALE > checked the other side and it is loose , so while I can drive , my car needs to go back on the lift at < PROPMALE>'s and get the other side done before it indeed breaks .. Since there was a mix-up and only one strap was sent , I can't go to VT on friday :( .... < PROPMALE > also has a check engine light on , so basically we could be vehicle less ... 
Going to the Magic Paintbrush to learn some more , to see < PROPFEMALE >(!) , to have lunch and to all and all enjoy myself in the wonderful world of Magic !

Every Christmas you always hear people saying they want and they bought . Well this is what I want . I want people who are sick with no cure to be able to be cured . I want children with no families to be adopted . I want people to never have to worry about food and shelter & heat . Now , lets see how many people actually care and bother to re-post this . I have a feeling I am gonna see almost no re-posts .

I may not be the most pretty or the sexiest , nor do I have the \perfect body\ " . I might not be someone's first choice but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not because I'm good at being me . I'm not proud of some of the things I've done in the past but I'm proud of who I am today . Take me as I am or watch me as I walk away ... Post this if you're proud of being you ! damn straight " 
They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it's been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy but will ALWAYS LOVE them . Re-post if you are blessed to have at least 1 of those friends in your life . 
Pay it Forward 2011 : I promise to send something handmade to the first 5 people who leave a comment here . They must in turn post this and send something they make to the first 5 people who comment on their status . The rules are that it must be handmade by you and it must be sent to your 5 people sometime in 2011 . 
I am an UN-APOLOGETIC < PROPFEMALE > N !! I pledge allegiance to the flag of the UNITED STATES OF < PROPFEMALE > , and to the REPUBLIC for which it stands , one nation under GOD , indivisible , with < PROPFEMALE > and JUSTICE for all !! I grew up reciting this every morning in school . We no longer do that for ... fear ... of OFFENDING SOMEONE !! Let's see how many < PROPFEMALE > NS will re-post this & not care about 
Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST name ... It can only be 1 word ... then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... DON'T just post a word and not copy ... That's NO FUN !! 
Missed the gym this morning , work at 5 with horrible migraine and heartburn .... headin to work now in the SNOW ! < PROPFEMALE > .... 
I'm not superstitious , but this year July has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So Copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy ,... will be without money . I can't let that person be ME ! What the heck ... - it cant hurt ! Good luck :) 
wonders how I will know if I have to go to work in the morning ? 
Please copy and paste to your status if you know someone or have been affected by someone who needs a foot up their ass . People who need a foot up their ass affect the lives of many . There is still no cure for someone who needs a foot up their ass , except a foot up their ass . Please help raise awareness as 93% of people won't re-post this . Why ? Because they need a foot up their ass too . Thanks !!! 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! ( Re-posted from another friend's status message . Feel free to do the same . )*** 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the minute you were born ; then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Repost if you have children you love more than life !!!!

I'm a little boy with glasses , the one they call a geek ; a little girl who never smiles cause I've got braces on my teeth . I'm that kid on every playground who is always chosen last ; you don't have to be my friend , but is it too much to ask : don't laugh at me , don't call me names , don't get your pleasure from my pain ? In God's eyes we ... ' re all the same . REPOST for bully awareness

As a parent I think of my child day and night . I love him/her in a way he will never understand . I will be there for him/her when no one else is . I would take a bullet , jump in front of a train , ask God to take me instead of him . My love for him/her is unconditional . If you have a child/children and know how I feel copy and paste this to your status

My first time being a facilitator for Magic Paintbrush this morning went really well ! I am in awe of how a little bit of paint ( or a lot of paint ) combines with laughter and fun to create INCREDIBLE MAGIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I say it every time , I am blessed to be part of something that gives so much to so many . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > O'Brien for seeing something in me and allowing me to find it too . 
Just had an example of a virus on facebook ! I went to send a Heart back to a friend and my anti-virus software blocked it IMMEDIATELY !!!! 
We are under a winter storm advisory ..... ;( 
Made it home and it took an hour , the roads were barely touched and I can't believe the people that drive WITHOUT their head lights !!! STUPID !!!! 
Ok , show of hands , who's tired of snow ? 
< PROPFEMALE > 
IT NEEDS TO STOP SNOWING ..... NOW !!!!!!!! 
Since the snow didn't stop like I hoped , we have shoveled about 18-24 inches , a LOT more than the 9-14 they said .... 
time to go to the gym , then to work .... 
Just so I can say it one more time , MIGRAINES SUCK !!! 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour .? 
It's Daughters Week ! If you have a beautiful Daughter that you love more than you can describe , copy and paste this to your status for a little while , but hold them in your heart for a lifetime ...

Very sadly , most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ??? Its Special Education week , and this is in HONOR of all the children who need a little extra help , < PROPFEMALE > & understanding ?
