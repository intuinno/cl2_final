Soon , it will be a new year . Another chapter in life . One filled with promises & memories waiting to be made . Let's take a step and capture this moment . We can make it last . :) 

Party tonight :) \ 
Only a few days left of break\ 
& back to school . 
Filipinos sure love to party & dance . 
Why are people trying to make me dance ? 
I'd rather be in Narnia than doing work :/ 
I'm so bored that I'm actually doing work ( - A-) 
Feeling ... Refreshed . FINALLY GOT OVER Club Sandwich . I have NO clue what I saw in that boy ... He's cute but NOT WORTH the < PROPMALE > . Besides , he's moving away and out of my heart . :) 
I <3 < PROPFIRST > !!! Lol jk . Watching Letters to < PROPFEMALE > . Main guy is < PROPFIRST > . BUT , idk . < PROPFIRST > ! Lol making fun of the movie . Sorta . But i love it . Lol 
When a person's in love , why is it hard for them to say a simple ' I love you ' , when others say it with ease and they don't mean it ? Why is falling out of love so complicated when falling in love is so simple and out of our control ? I ponder about love these days . Does it mean anything anymore ? Or has it just turned into a game for one's amusement ? Idk . I really don't know . 
To love is to suffer . To avoid suffering one must not love . But then one suffers from not loving . Therefore to love is to suffer , not to love is to suffer . To suffer is to suffer . To be happy is to love . To be happy then is to suffer . But suffering makes one unhappy . Therefore , to be unhappy one must love , or love to suffer , or suffer from too much happiness . I hope you're getting this down . -Woody < PROPFIRST > 
Challenges for flutes and saxes tomorrow . I don't really care if I win or lose . It doesn't matter to me either way . 
Truth be told , I don't regret liking that idiot . Even though I'm getting over him I still wonder WHY THE HECK DID I START LIKING HIM ?! I got annoyed with him at beginning of the year and I kinda do now . Oh well . I'm sorta glad he's moving away . I can move on with my life and find someone WAY BETTER than that idiot . ;D 
I lost . :P 
Cause when I'm wih him , I am thinking of you . 
THE GAME . ;P 
Our 8th grade band is the worst . :/ 
Ok , we were an epic fail with the rap and break dancing but whatever . :) BEST CONCERT Ever !!! I gotz an award . :d Drinking Pepsi is wierd . 
Algebra Exam tomorrow and I didn't study . Mr. Oakwood's notebook due and I haven't done all of it . Microscope quiz in Ms. Wolfe's . Quote memorization in Mrs. Manaher's . I officially DESPISE tomorrow . The only good thing about it is eating pancakes . :/ 
Even if I told you how I feel bout you , you ignored it and continued on with your life . Your moving & I won't wait for you . My feelings for you will disappear slowly when you're gone but one thing I won't forgot that I LOVE so much bout you is the way you made me smile by being your goofy self . I'm glad I fell for an idiot like you . No regrets . I like you C.S. and this will be my last time saying so & you'll never hear it . 
They Laughed At Me And Asked What Is It That I See In Him ? \ 
\ 
I Smiled Back And Said , \ 
\Everything You Don't\ "" 
Dude , I like screwed up my audtions today . I don't think I'll get in . Whatever , idc really . I still have other options . :p Oh , and that boy confuses me !!! Ugh , why oh why do I still like him ? I want to get over him but I know I can't cause part me still likes him no matter what ... Guys are such jerks when it comes to liking them . :/ 
Damnit . He's not moving ... I don't know whether to be happy or mad . :/ Why is life so unfair . 
You know what I LOVE most in this world ?... Guess . And no , it's not a guy :/ Well , with the exception of < PROPMALE > Knight ... That's it . 
There are two options you are given when answering my feelings . YES : If you like me , then go out with me . NO : If you don't like me , just say it so I can move on . But please , don't just ignore my feelings even though you know I like you and don't make lame excuses because in the end , I won't wait any longer for you to respond and soon I'll be gone in someone else's arms and you'd regret your mistake . :) 
Gravitation can not be held responsible for people falling in love . - < PROPFIRST > Einstein 
... I lost an inch . I used to be 4'11 '' and now I'm 4'10 '' ... I'm trying to get taller , not shrink . :/ Will I ever reach 5'00'' ? 
Eating rice at exactly 11:36:38 pm on May 28 , 2010 and reading < PROPFEMALE > Yori Dango at chapter 54 < PROPFEMALE > 1 . Idk ... I'm bored right now . Omg , I sound like < PROPMALE > . D: 
You know what , forget love . IDC anymore . I'll just let things happen if they're meant to be . I'm sick of waiting for that IDIOT to answer . D:< Where's my chocolate stash when I need it ? Urgh , I can't believe my mom hid it somewhere . >:/

I don't care what others think or need from me anymore . Even if they do push me away & only need me when things go bad , I'll be there . But if they chose to not let me be part of their life , then it's fine with me . If God decided I shouldn't be a big part of your life then I won't cause somewhere out there , I'll find someone who's willing to stay when you just walked in & left without saying goodbye .

I hate when there's no trust , the tears , & the fights . You two really dont see how much I HATE IT . You two are so dense . So stupid . You make me try to choose but i cant & all i want to do is escape . Escape from your stupidity to a place where i can just cry & be alone . I dont want to live like this . YOU DONT KNOW HOW MUCH I HATE IT . You two just dont know . Just leave me alone . Please . 
Everyone . Just leave me alone . Please . 
Im tired of crying . I wish my voice can reach you two but it wont . I need someone who's willing to be there for me . I wont sleep tonight . I'll just crawl under a rock 
I cant cry anymore . Im done with both of your stupidity . 
I'll just smile & hope for the best . This stupidity & sadness wont bring me down anymore . I'll just smile to hide away tears & keep walking forward . This wasnt my choice , actions , thoughts , & words . They're yours . So dont bring me down with your mistakes . 
To those who texted me back last night , thank you <3 Made me feel better . You know who you guys are and I love you for that . I couldn't ask for better friends .

\Are you sure they're all from Florida ? \ " - Patrycja < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Awwwwwwww :) 
So get back , back , back to where we lasted . \ 
Just like I imagine . \ 
I could never feel this way . \ 
So get back , back , back to the disaster . \ 
My heart's beating faster . \ 
Holding on to feel the same . \ 
This may never start . \ 
We could fall apart\ 
And I'd be your memory . \ 
Lost your sense of fear . \ 
Feelings insincere . \ 
Can I be your memory ? \ 
Can I be your memory ? 
I want counseling really bad . 
My mama got hurt :( Let's pray for her so that she'll get better :3 <3 
\Queenie 
\But can I still keep a place in your heart ? \ " :) " 
\It happens every time when I see you\ 
\I will promise myself I won't care 
First person to like this , I will change my last name to their last name and 2nd person to like this , I will change my middle name to your first name :3 GO ! 
I'm a dork but you gotta love me :3 
A memory is a photograph taken by the heart to make a special moment last forever . <3 
It's funny how a boy can make a girl think he likes her when he doesn't and how a girl can make a boy think she doesn't care anymore about him when truth be told , she really does . Just an observation :P 
I wonder . . . If I disappear from your life for a bit , will you notice that I'm gone ? Please don't be mad at me if I've been ignoring you . Just understand that this is for the best right now . 
Somewhere there's someone , who dreams about your\ 
smile , and finds in your presence , that life is worth while , so when\ 
you are lonely , remember it's true , somebody somewhere is thinking of\ 
\you . \ " :) <3 "

Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact\ 
that most people enter a relationship in order to get something . \ 
They’re trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good . In\ 
reality , the only way a relationship will last is if you see your\ 
relationship as a place that you go to give , and not a place that you\ 
go to take . ~ < PROPFIRST > Robbins 
< PROPFIRST > Montano , the conversations we have greatly entertain me . Our randomness is amazing & irreplaceable . Just wanna let you know my homie :)

And we'll never get back what we \ 
Gave away , when we still have that fire in our eyes\ 
Don't believe everything happiness says\ 
Nothings as real as our old reckless ways\ 
When we drink by the fires\ 
The burning car tires\ 
Bad girls and good liars\ 
The dreams we'd conspire\ 
The days we went crazy \ 
The nights wild and hazy \ 
Man how in the hell did we get here ? 
Gonna draw Reshiram & Zekrom . OH YEAH . 
Taste of Awesome + Six Billion Secrets + LoveGivesMeHope = Happy < PROPFEMALE > At Night :]

Well , at least school is out in two days :) \ 
But then again , I have nothing to do over break D: \ 
Mehhhhhh . 
Ya know what I noticed ? \ 
Having an imagination is a powerful thing . \ 
Being able to draw is a gift . Combine those two \ 
& you can create situations that will make you happy , \ 
but most of the time , they will never happen in real life . \ 
That's what I like about drawing . \ 
It's like a medium to get away from reality . \ 
Same goes for music . 
Is attempting to draw something she has never drawn before . O.e 
Feels REALLY PROUD right now :D \ 
The drawing turned out good ! :D \ 
I hope he'll be happy . :3 <3 
Just spent 5 minutes of my time being spun around on a chair by my brother @.@ today was a good day :) made a lot of people happy <3 
Is frustrated . DAMN YOU ORIGAMI < PROPFEMALE > . Why can't I make you ? Dx I feel like such a disappointment . . . 
< PROPFIRST > Montano , I was LOL'ing at the video xD . THAT WAS AWESOME . Truly made my night . It relieved me of my frustration of not being able to make a paper < PROPFEMALE > xD 
I FINALLY MADE AN ORIGAMI < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
OMG , I'M SO HAPPY . OMG OMG OMG . \ 
So how is your lovely morning ? :D 
At a party :) text me !

BEST PART ABOUT TRON ? The part where there was a fight scene in the club & the DJs started playing music to the fighting . Fantastic . :D 
Boredom should be illegal . :/

Happening to you and me <3 :) \ 
The Best Thing - Relient K 
I don't know how to put these feelings into words . \ 
To sum it up , I wanna be what you deserve . <3 
Thinking too much is really unhealthy . 
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer . \ 
Do you know you're unlike any other ? \ 
You'll always be my thunder , and I said\ 
Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors , \ 
I don't wanna ever love another , \ 
You'll always be my thunder . \ 
So bring on the rain , \

Dying from laughter xD & missing him :( 
There are so many things I need to change about myself . 
Crying is good . It makes you feel a lot better when you're done . 
I'm thankful that I have a wonderful mother who understands me . I can talk to her about anything . I'm thankful she's in my life . 
I just noticed something . . . \ 
I always put my hair up when I'm drawing . \ 
Not that you needed to know :P \ 
Just a random fact of my life . 
It's not an obsession . \ 
It's a simple way of life :D 
Just woke up from a catnap :3 
Is this reality ? Or am I living a dream ? 
( > ' w')> <3 You shall give me a hug . 
Coughing spasm : c . . . Meh .

Everything we say in this kitchen is perverted :D 
I sometimes wonder . . . \ 
How long happiness truly lasts . 
My brother is attempting to kill < PROPFEMALE > & I . O_O 
The Walking Dead marathon in half an hour :D \ 
Never seen it but I can't wait to :3 
Never go on a scavenger hunt with < PROPMALE > . . . \ 
Or my brother . . . \

You're one of a kind . <3 \ 
Did you know that ? :D 
Please don't ask me what I like about you\ 
' Cause it's every little thing you do &\

Bacon at night ? OH YEAH . 
Left school early :P At ze dentist now . Still sick though :( 
I want to stay by your side . \ 
Just praying for time to be kind . 
I'm screwed (; _ ;) 
There should be an invention or magical thing that could make something you lost that you're trying to find , appear right in front of you . 
In a sad attempt to find my Geometry paper for Mrs. Rodriguez ( which is prolly lost forever ) , I found my old binder filled with my Yu-Gi-Oh cards xD 
Feeling that today will be a good day :) 
Today was awesome :D \ 
Pwned people at Super Smash Bros . \ 
Had fun confusing < PROPMALE > Stratton <3 \

Still working on my manga . Oui Oui . 
I wanna be carried bridal-style :D 
I love talking to you . \ 
It's as simple as that . \ 
No explanation is needed :) 
Always knew I'd find someone . \ 
I never dreamt it'd be like this . \ 
You've surpassed , \ 
All that I've hoped for ( and ever wished ) . \ 
And I'm tryin ' so hard , \ 
With all my heart and mind , \ 
To make your life\ 
As good as you've made mine . :) <3 
I've been feeling that everyone is drifting farther and farther away . \ 
What happened to the promise we made ? \ 
That's what I was afraid of . 
I just burnt my cookies . . . (; _ ;) 
Singing a Backstreet Boys song at the library :D 
< PROPFEMALE > , her neighbor , & I were chased by a Siamese cat O_O 
It's really good to hear your voice , \ 
Sayin ' my name , it sounds so sweet . \ 
Coming from the lips of an angel , \ 
Hearing those words , it makes me weak . \ 
And I never wanna say goodbye . 
Backstreet Boys = W I N <3 \ 
What happened to the good music ? : c 
Warning : If zombies < PROPMALE > us , I'm tripping you . :) 
Singing the Double Rainbow song while cooking :D DAMN . IT'S A DOUBLE RAINBOW . Library later with the best ;) 
Don't care what's written in your history , \ 
As long as you're here with me . \ 
I don't care who you are . \ 
Where you're from . \ 
What you did . \ 
As long as you love me . <3 
Kinda disappointed I didn't get serenaded to : c 
' Cause even when I dream of you , \ 
The sweetest dream will never do . \ 
I'd still miss you babe , \ 
And I don't wanna miss a thing . :) 
A person like you is really only like a strong addiction . \ 
Is something wrong with my head ? \ 
Is my heart drunk ? \ 
The place it staggers to - The world you live in . 
So , the music at the beginning of the \Iron Jawed Angels\ " movie was \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Galvan , < PROPFEMALE > Galvan and I are attempting to dance :D \ 
& RJ is very forceful when it comes to < PROPFEMALE > xD LMAO\ 
Library later with the best ? :D I think yes ! 
If a guy picks you by surprise , \ 
And carries you bridal-style up a flight of stairs , \ 
No matter how many times you tell him you're heavy , \ 
And he still does it anyways , \ 
He's a keeper . :D <3 
Awesome stuff is going to happen tomorrow at the library ! :D \ 
You should go . \ 
Why ? \

In everything I do , you bring the best out of me . 
You're in my arms , and all the world is calm . \ 
Music playing on for only two . \ 
So close together and when I'm with you , \ 
So close to feeling alive . 
\Is this a habit of yours ? Falling off of stuff ? \ " \ 
I will reinvent myself . \ 
I want to become a better person . \ 
I'm not doing this \ 
So my parents or my friends\ 
Could be proud of me . \ 
I'm doing this , \ 
So I can be proud of myself . \ 
I want to stop thinking negatively . 
You put your feelings down . \ 
You stopped your tears . \ 
You brought me love . \ 
You held onto my heart . \ 
You held with hope to have me near . \ 
Sometimes I close my eyes . \ 
Sometimes I let my hunger rise . \ 
I think of all you are , \ 
You are the love of my life . 
Alli & < PROPMALE > are comparing muscles xD 
THE RAINBOW THEORY IN MATH :D OMG , IT'S A DOUBLE RAINBOW . NO WAY . 
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told . \ 
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back . \ 
I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing , \ 
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here , keep me here . :) 
Do the D . A . N . C . E . \ 
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , Fight . \ 
Stick to the B . E . A . T . \ 
Get ready to ignite . \ 
You were such a P . Y . T . \ 
Catching all the lights . \ 
Just easy as A . B . C . \ 
That's how we make it right . ;D 
Had Ramen for breakfast & now chillin ' with my love : the guitar . :D 
It's official : I'm in love with my guitar . <3 
I can relate , it’s a new sensation from my heart to yours . \ 
I’ve never sang like this before . \ 
Cupid found his mark , \ 
Shot his arrow through our hearts , \ 
Said he planned it from the start , \ 
My < PROPFIRST > . \ 
I’ll kiss every scar that's been planted on your heart , \ 
And love you for who you are , \ 
My < PROPFIRST > . <3 
Let's capture this moment . \ 
' Cause we'll never have it again . \ 
Let's make it last for as long time is kind . \ 
' Cause we'll never have this moment again . 
I hate fighting . \ 
I hate crying . \ 
Just wishing it never started . . . 
My mind is wasted from these negative thoughts . I need a sweet healing . 
I shouldn't be crying early this morning . . . \ 
At least you won't see my tears . \ 
I'm tired of all this . \ 
You guys make me want to move out . \ 
I'm sick of it . I really am . 
Take my hand , \ 
Don't let go . \ 
But please remember , \ 
Hearts can grow . \ 
We still have to take it slow . \ 
I love with caution . 
I wonder how many times I have to cry before my heart grows tired & I run out of tears . Why must you continue to test my heart ? I need someone's arms to run to . But where are you when I need you the most ? 
Put yourself in her position . \ 
All she needs is recognition . \ 
Loves not enough when you say it . \ 
Don't you know you gotta mean it ? \ 
Screwing up the best thing ever , \ 
Is something you'll regret forever . \ 
Take her and make sure she feels it . \ 
Let her know you'll never let her go . </3 
Will this ever end ? Will this house ever be a home again ? 
There's a danger in loving somebody too much . 
Man , these times are hard . \ 
Yeah , they're making us crazy . \ 
Don't give up on me baby . 
Choir concert ! :D sitting next to < PROPMALE > & cant wait to see < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > sing ! who's going ? :3 
Before highschool ends , I want to do at least one year of band :D scared though . . . Who'd like to help me if I do ? xP 
I just want to stop and thank you baby . \ 
How sweet it is to be loved by you . :) 
Miserable At Best . 
Whenever I want to be away from society , \ 
I jump into a world painted with my dreams . \ 
Where music heals my soul and < PROPMALE > is nothing \ 
But my feelings put into reality . \ 
Goodbye , while I step into that world :D 
Procrastinating on homework . \ 
Siting here . Waiting for you . \ 
Yet , you're not here to talk to :/\ 
So in the mean time , I shall indulge \ 
Myself in cheesy stuff to entertain me . 
Lmao , < PROPFIRST > Montano is * giggling * at my innocence xD\ 
Oh the convos we have :P 
Do I mean anything to you ? 
Just saw Ms. < PROPFIRST > at Albertsons ! :D Oh , memories xD & now they're playing ' As Long As You Love Me ' by the Backstreet Boys :3 
There's something wrong with me . 
Waiting In Vain 
Made $35 on three 8x10 paintings I made & sold ! ! ! :D SO UBERLY HAPPY . 
I wonder if you even try to understand my heart . \ 
I guess not . 
\Les rêves des amoureux sont comme < PROPFEMALE > bon vin . \ " :) " 
Happy 4 Months of Togetherness , < PROPMALE > Stratton ! :D \ 
\There's no other like you . \ 
All's fair in love and war . \ 
I'll fight to even up the score . \ 
The rules are fair : It's do or die . \ 
But knowing you , you'll never try . \ 
You lie to me , I'll lie to you . \ 
That's just what we do . \ 
I'll play this game to prove you wrong . \ 
So I can prove you're not the one . 
With my true love : the guitar <3 
Everything should be fine . . . \ 
But why does my heart still ache from this pain ? 
Love is not a game . Don't lose my respect for you . 
\You're good with your hands . \ " -Number 6 ( she's BA ) " 
* I thought I own the whole world hearing \I love you\ " from you * :) " 
Good luck at your track meet , < PROPMALE > Stratton ! :D <3 
Even just hearing your voice , \ 
For those couple minutes , \ 
Made my day a whole lot better . :) 
BUBBLE WRAP . ' Nuff said :D 
A smile is nearly always inspired by another smile . :) 
Tired of conversation . \ 
Show me something real . \ 
Find out what your part is . \ 
Play it how you feel . \ 
Tell me what to do about you . 
\Art is not being exact . It's about your own interpretation . \"" 
\I can't pretend I don't care when you don't think about me . . . I'm trying to forget that I'm addicted to you . \"" 
I wish you would understand me , but you don't even try . 
Gonna go play basketball and run for a bit to get my mind off certain things . 
Be my escape . 
* Stuck in the sand , with the waves at my feet . And I wish , you'd come crash into me . Cause where you are is where I want to be now . * 
\No one understands the true nature of love . The heart is the ultimate mystery . \"" 
\The most important things in life aren't heard . They are felt . \"" 
\They say the eyes are the windows to the soul . \ 
\Once tasted 
Oh , you're my favorite thing about this town :) <3 
Why do you keep silent and hide it all ? \ 
You want someone to listen to you , right ? \ 
No one will laugh at you , so why don't you talk ? \ 
No one will understand you if you don't speak out . \ 
Just thinking it will never reach to anyone . \ 
What troublesome beings , humans are . 
\Always kiss like it's the first time & the last time . \ " :) -Leap Year " 
I just realized how precious the time I have left with you really is . 
\Could someone tell me what to say to just make you stay ? \ 
Every long lost dream , \ 
Led me to where you are . \ 
Others who broke my heart , \ 
They were like Northern Stars . \ 
Pointing me on my way , \ 
Into your loving arms . \ 
This much I know is true , \ 
That God blessed the broken road , \ 
That led me straight to you . :) 
Oovooing < PROPFIRST > Montano ! :D \ 
LAWL ; he serenaded sad , Mexican music to me xD \ 
Highly entertaining :3 
Picked up my flute after like almost a year . \ 
I just fell in love again . <3 \ 
Band , Sophomore Year , here I come ! :D 
\Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you ? \ " \ 
On my way to MIAMI ;) text me ~ 
Lawl , I just followed my brother in the McDonald's playhouse thing xD I felt like a kid again going through the tunnels & down the slide :) 
I can only move in time , but that so-called eternity is not infinite . 
These next few days , while my lovely band geeks are away , I shall indulge myself in my < PROPMALE > fantasies to get away from the boringness of reality :) 
This old flame , it won't light itself . This needs a compromise . \ 
You're the spark . I'm the fuse . We'll make the perfect match . \ 
So what are you waiting for ?
