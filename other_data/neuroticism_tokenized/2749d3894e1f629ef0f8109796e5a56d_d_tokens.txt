Uuuuuuuh !! Chemistry homework is so annoying ! T ~ T 
Why is Mr. Capaldo so creepily musical ??????? 
Listening to Fullmetal Alchemist soundtrack while I do Chem homework ! :D 
I can't decide if I thought Origin : Spirits of the Past was a good movie or not ... I definitely liked the appearance and feel , but the plot progression was too jumpy/accelerated and the ending was abrupt , melodramatic ( mostly because of the jumpiness ) , un-fulfilling , and in general , I felt like I wanted more , but not in the same way the last < PROPFEMALE > of the first book in a good series makes you feel ... 
Today is indeed a historic day . 
Waaa ! I can't make my hair Kotaro-like ! T ~ T

I forget who told me about it , but from a guy's perspective , B Gata H Kei is a tragedy about a kind and quiet boy who is ruthlessly tricked into falling in love with a sex-crazed girl with severe anger problems ... Not far from the actual plot , but it sounds different this way . 
Hey , my parents and sister are going to be out today , and I have ( practically ) nothing to do . Does anybody want to < PROPFEMALE > out ??? 
Shikabane Hime is ... so ... good ! T ~ T nmm ( < tears of joy + fist of passion )
