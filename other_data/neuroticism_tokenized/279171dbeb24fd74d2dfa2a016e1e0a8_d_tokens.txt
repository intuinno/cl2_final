Post this on your status If you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice- people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUALRIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ?
