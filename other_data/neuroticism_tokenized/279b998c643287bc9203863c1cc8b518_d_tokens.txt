My embedded systems code WORKS ; 
I HAVE SO MUCH HOMEWORK AND NOT ENOUGH TIME . PRAY FOR ME . Getting off Facebook NOW ... 
My code worked again this week so i'm not a failure ; 
Life isn't about surviving the storm , but how to dance in the rain . Thanks Dad !! 
... Scooter has fleas ... 
Never got my second code to work . Not gonna complain ; 
code 1 worked ... code 2 was just shy of being done AGAIN ;\ 
got a C on the last one like that though last week ; 
I'm up way too late putting papers inside of notebooks on papers with tape ... Ahh , the college life of an engineer . :)) 
Going to take my Embedded Systems test in twenty minutes ... * slight panic * I'll be fine .... :)

Too much homework to sleep . A little more relaxed about my fate with my GPA though ; 
Gotta drop Calc . My advisor's gonna kill me .... <_< ... oh noes ... >_> 
This night couldn't get any weirder if I wanted it to . Goodnight all and see you when life returns to the way it should be . 
So ... I didn't drop calc .... either the craziest thing I've ever done or the stupidest ... not sure yet ... * cross your fingers * 
I GOT A 97% ON MY PHYSICS TEST !!!!!! 
I need Calculus to be fun again so I actually want to learn it ... 
Sick as a dog . At least it wasn't last week . 
Drove Dad home from the hospital . Everything went fine . He's out for about 6 weeks . Just found out Scooter's flea collar is lavender like the walls in my room xD 
Almost Love , by < PROPFEMALE > Jarrell .... find it . 
I was myself , that's what I did wrong . That's what I've always done wrong . But somehow , everyone loves me for it . This is the balance I live in ... I've been searching for so long , just to find I already have it . 
Bet money I passed my calc final ... answered 10.5 out of 12 questions . Need a 70% to pass the class . 
My roommate just told me I calculate my grades when I'm stressed ... God I'm predictable . So ... systems final in half an hour ... * grade might be a CD * 
Forgot to tell < PROPFEMALE > I loved her before she left . I LOVE YOU < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Good news , I'm not going to get lower than a 2.0 ... bad news , I'm not going to get a 2.5 ... I get a conditional but I also keep my scholarship for next term . I accept that . Moving on !!!!!!!!!! 
On the one hand , i wanted to be home , on the other , there's nothing here ... Perhaps my illusion of home is no longer the reality . Perhaps my home is north of here . 
Going to walk around a lake because it's the best way to catch up on the happenings in my home town . 
You've got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round . 
Say it if it's worth saving me . 
I'm studying for a test . It's day 1 . Gotta love the college life . 
getting a math tutor early this term . not having a repeat of last quarter . surprisingly enough , physics at 8am is FUN
