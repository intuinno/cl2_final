< PROPFIRST > decided that I could no longer share his Facebook account . I finally had to get my own < PROPFEMALE > . 

We are at Cowboy Stadium tailgating in advance of the TCU game opener . 
#3 TCU leading #5 Utah at the half . 23 to zip . 
Final score TCU 47 - Utah 7 . The National Championship Game is looking like a real option this year . Go Frogs ! 
Off to a great start - So far we discovered at the Airport Security that < PROPFIRST>' drivers license was expired . Then we got through security despite that but < PROPFIRST > lost his luggage in the airport . After a panic stricken few moments we found it back at security where he had forgotten to pick it up off the conveyer belt . I told him that I was going to have to keep a closer eye on him from now on ! 
I got to put my Michigan driving skills to work today . 
Just adopted 2 puppies , about 7 wks old . They are of unknown parentage but appear to be a shepherd mix . We named them Newt and Deets . 
Wondering if Pet Health Insurance is a good purchase or not ? Here is your answer - treatment for an \Upset Stomach\ " for 2 puppies plus one nights stay in the Pet Hospital . Total is $700 . This is after just 7 days of having these puppies ! Compare that to $19/mo for The Pet Health Insurance premium . Oh why did I not make this purchase immediately ? ( this is me kicking myself ) . ouch ! "
