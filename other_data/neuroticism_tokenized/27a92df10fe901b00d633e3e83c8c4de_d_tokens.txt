The gym has a wii !?!? 
I WANT ICECREAM !!!

AH ! i need to pay for housing ! 
finished reading < PROPFEMALE>'s Adventures in Wonderland . Odd book . Maybe Through the Looking Glass is um , odder .

Road trip to Florida ! :] 
Great day . I love east coast beaches . And being able to wear my bathing suit everyday . 
I think this is the happiest I've been all summer ! XD 
Going to San < PROPFIRST > in SIXTEEN DAYS ! :D 
Apple sucks . 
Have you ever missed someone so much that you feel like your skin is literally stretching just so you can be that much closer to that one person ? This sucks . And it's rather uncomfortable and I'm losing sleep over it . 
There's a book called The Book of Awesome . I need it . 
I really need < PROPFIRST > :( Stupid army boot camp . 
Picked my classes . 
No worries , I'm not a lesbian . 
Hard to pack clothes when I look good in everything . ;]

We accept the love we think we deserve . 
Today I saw an old granny wearing fashionable stunna shades and a fat dude running in what looked like underwear . I love san < PROPFIRST > . It feels so good to be back . And who knew safeway could be so much fun ? =] 
Dude : What happened to your finger ? \ 
Me : Oh , I was just juggling knives and accidentally sliced it open . \ 
Dude : * laughs * Really ? \

Just spent an incredible day hanging out with Angel :] We saw < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World ( awesome ! ) . There was this intense preview ... that is until the whole movie theater found out it was directed by M . Night Shyamalan . The entire movie theater went \ugh . \ " It was hilarious . " 
I'm so good I forget it ... sometimes . ;] 
I'm so happy , I think I'm glowing ... :) 
What does it mean to be human ? Nothing . That's why we're striving to be something else . 
I know we got it good , but they got it made and the grass is looking greener each day . 
Isn't it amazing how some people just DON'T change ? Kinda makes me sad . Seriously people , get some damn self-respect and go experience life . Get out of your comfort zone . Laugh at yourself . Stop waiting for things that won't come and go get it . Live dammit . It's quite fun . Be a bad ass , not a wimp . 
Today went from good to epic in about 1 minute . :) 
The hardest part of ending is starting again . 
Sooooo tired that I'm ditching class to take a nap . then i'm gonna pull an another all-nighter with jairo and a GIANT thing of dr. pepper from subway :]

Hello . I'm being passive aggressive on facebook cuz I know I'm bitching about something that doesn't even matter and too chicken to say the real reason why I'm irritated :) \ 
\ 
HOORAY FOR PASSIVE AGGRESSIVENESS . Can I get some likes ? 
I think I sprained my wrist :( 
Don't say a word just come over and lie here with me cuz I'm just about to set fire to everything I see . I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe . There , I just said it : I'm scared you'll forget about me ... & hearts ; 
Damn . I need to stop treating people like they're worth something . They obviously can't handle it . Cosmic disappointment . 
So ... anyone wanna be in a movie ? lol 
I can feel the awesomeness of today already seeping into me , but then again , that could also be the minty freshness of my toothpaste . The world may never know . o . 0 
Castro street fair tomorrow ! WOOT ! :D

He keeps talking about girls like they're all cunts yet asks me on a date ... Gee , I feel ever so special . Well , takes a douche bag to know a cunt . ;]

lol . it's raining so everyone's on facebook . :) 
When I become a director , I'm gonna have someone make me a sandwich . 
What do you do when someone you know is fading into scum ? Just wondering ... 
Please put this on your status if you know someone , or are related 2 someone who has been eaten by a dragon . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have been eaten by dragons . The other 7% are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers . 
Giants kicked some giant ass tonight . That's right , FEAR THE BEARD ! :D 
I WANT MASHED POTATOES !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
WAY TO GO GIANTS !!!!!!! 
So I was just thinking about life and ya know what ? I very much love my friends :)

Filling out job applications ... 
Don't come back for me , don't come back at all . 
Sooooo .... i think i really want tattoo sleeves , and a zipper down my spine . Among other things .

I & hearts ; water . 
There's a rumor that all the potter stars got tattoo lightning bolt scars on their rear ends . LOL 
I just watched \Turtles Can Fly\ " and now I'm depressed . One of the saddest movies ever .... but still really well done . UGH " 
I'm hoping we can make some wishes out of airplanes . 
Well if this doesn't work out , I can always be a surrogate mother ! 
Apparently men dream about other men more than women . Women dream about both pretty equally . No wonder guys are always trying to show how macho they are to other men . They don't want guys to think they're gay . 
So I'm writing my paper for my final and i REALLY want to put a < PROPMALE > potter reference . Might be a < PROPMALE > too informal though . 
So I think for my new year's resolution I'm gonna throw out all those people who bring me down . They're pretty much junk in my life to begin with . No need to be a pack rat . :) 
Boy you a sight to see , kinda something like me ;D 
I want to get drunk with Dr. < PROPFIRST > . 
So .... I think I just got a job ? lol 
Gonna watch some HEY < PROPMALE > ! Kickin ' old school :D 
I helped a man find his wallet and got a new life goal . I know it's a little late , but it feels like Christmas finally . :) 
Got a par t-t ime job at a gym , met a guy , hoping to get another part time job at another gym , and i just drank a milkshake while experiencing an earthquake ( i think ) . I'm loving 2011 . 
Damn . I want a cookie . 
Got an email asking me to sign up for the Peace Corps . Hmm ... 
Today I was literally in the middle of a drug exchange . And I saw a hooker who was with a client going to a hotel . I also saw a mom smoking her cigarette while walking her baby . This girl with a banana gave her a funny look . Alas , the wonders of San < PROPFIRST > . 
The bad thing about UNO computerized games is that it won't let you cheat . :( 
Woke up singing and dancing . For a brief moment , my life was a musical . 
I'm gonna meet < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > this weekend . 
Apparently the movie that < PROPMALE>'s doing here in SF is also staring < PROPFEMALE > paltrow , < PROPFEMALE > winslet , and < PROPFIRST > law . i wonder if they're here . And the director is < PROPFIRST > Soderbergh ( Ocean's Eleven , among others ) . Yep . I'm excited . Hanging out downtown all tomorrow . See if I can get some pics on the Alcatraz TV show that's gonna premiere in the fall too . 
* Girl kisses guy out of joy*\

woman : don't worry , i don't . \ 
I & hearts ; < PROPFIRST > Hood . 
Tomorrow is gonna SUCK . Yeah optimism . 
I did laundry and now my clothes are all soft and snuggly . :) 
Wondering why you're only seeing status updates from the same people ? Facebook has changed its News Feed so that , by default , you can only see updates from people you have recently interacted with . To change this , click the arrow next to ' most recent ' then \edit options\ " and check the box to receive updates from ALL friends .... Most importantly - repost this . Only a few of your friends will actually see it ! " 
I have succeeded in doing nothing constructive all day . 
While searching the internet , I found bacon , cupcake , and pickled toothpaste . Odd ... 
... I've been out bid on ebay :'( 
Coca-cola would be green if coloring wasn't added to it ... knowledge can be disgusting at times . 
Whoever sent me a message on facebook I cannot read it . Because facebook has been retarded these past few days and won't allow me to do any sort of emailing thing . So ... just call me ? Or something that doesn't involve messaging over facebook . 
HEY PEOPLE . I wanna write a new blog , and i'm just wondering what you think is useless . it could be anything in our daily lives from ideas , to things , to places , etc . If i like it , i'll ... um , do something special for you on sextimebomb.com . Give you a blog of honor or something where i talk about your awesomeness . :) K THANKS ! 
Gonna have to find a new job :( 
Friday I'm gonna get a haircut and a milkshake . Hopefully it doesn't rain . :D 
Go you your profile . Look at the sidebar - the first five people are your team for the Zombie Apocalypse . < PROPFEMALE > Arrowsmith , < PROPMALE > Sublett , < PROPFIRST > M Castillo , < PROPFIRST > Pippin , and < PROPFEMALE > Goff . < PROPFIRST > , I am not above leaving you behind . :P My team's got attitude . 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold three kg . The length of a penis is three times the length of the thumb . The femur is harder than concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink two times as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read the entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . 
So my entire body feels like one giant bruise , and i can't tell if it's cuz of working out or if i sleep walked into an oncoming semi truck ... 
I beat < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Tonna in 3 out of 3 games of bowling . :) 
Right now ... sucks . :/ 
Ah jeeze , I miss this weekend & hearts ; 
Damn Kiri , you've got game ;D 
So these middle-eastern identical twin guys walk out of a bank carrying their motorcycle helmets and they walk right past me , and well , i couldn't stop staring . And then this dude walked by me and laughed at me for ogling . -.- Idk why I'm sharing this story . Just thought it was funny ... Go Giants ! & hearts ; :} 
I LOVE < PROPMALE > TEJADA ! 
I think the 5 hour energy drink worked . 
I like how the chick turns into < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and not the black dude in that xbox commercial . 
Epic weekend & hearts ; 
I just realized that this project thing that's worth 40% of my grade is due at 7 pm tonight . Welp , just 23 more pages left to go and 15 hours to do it in ! Then I need to write an essay for my other class . =[ 
I wish being a game contestant was a career option . 
Excited for the weekend ! :] 
STRESS ! hate finals :/ 
HELLO PEOPLE OF FACEBOOK , \ 
can anyone give me awkward moments ? i'm gonna start writing blogs again . well , soon anyway . once finals are over . it doesn't have to be from personal experience . if you win , you can get frozen yogurt ... with gummy bears on top from japantown next time your in sf :) 
I think my brain is going to explode . 
Um , excuse me sir , but your awesomeness is getting in the way of my wish to remain apathetic & hearts ; 
Going to take a nap and then off to < PROPFIRST > for the last time before summer break . 
I look at the people holding hands in the hallways and I try to think how it all works . At the school dances , I sit in the background , and I wonder how many couples will dance to ' their song ' . In the hallways I see the girls wearing the guys ' jackets , and I think about the idea of property . And I wonder if anyone is really happy . I hope they are . I really hope they are . - < PROPFIRST > Chbosky , Perks Of Being A Wallflower 
Sometimes I feel like a cartoon . 
* complain * 
Had to wreck my 3,999 piece puzzle today . I think I died a little inside doing it . :( 
I'm afraid if I go to sleep I won't wake up to my alarm and I'll miss my flight and the apocalypse will happen , so I will drink this nasty coffee and try not to wake up Angel Plascencia as I bounce from wall to wall :) 
I think I'm gonna chop off my hair again , and write a script about a white dude who sells tacos .... but maybe not in that order :p i'm kiiiiiiiiinda bored . 
Been pestering my parents all week but I FINALLY got to watch < PROPMALE > POTTER #7 ! Think I'm gonna watch it again haha . Had a chill birthday , thanks everyone for wishing my a good birthday :) 
* deep manly voice * KINGDOM HEARTS !!! ;] 
* poke times infinity * I WIN ! >:} 
Dang , I miss SF and < PROPFIRST > AFB :( 
I should've bought a falcon ... :/ 
So I got a job interview ... in San < PROPFIRST > :/ 
One of the first things I'm gonna do when I get back to Frisco is watch a Giants ' game on TV . MyP2P just ain't cutting it . 
If I owned my own ball team I'd name it Ball Busters . 
I grew a quarter of an inch :) 
When I watch Teen Mom , I sometimes wonder if < PROPFIRST > is a real person or an actor . 
I & hearts ; < PROPMALE > Longbottom :) 
In the desert\ 
I saw a creature , naked , bestial , \ 
Who , squatting upon the ground , \ 
Held his heart in his hands , \ 
And ate of it . \ 
I said , \Is it good friend ? \ " \ 
I'm curious to know what Sirius Black's middle name is . I hope it's < PROPFIRST > . 
Borders is going out of business ... :'( 
I wanna go to a Giants game with a poster that says HUFF IT TO ME . 
I have just discovered that my ringtone is a techno version of the < PROPFIRST > Myers theme song . Hmm ... 
For all the single ladies who are in such a hurry to find someone , here's a piece of biblical advice \ 
: < PROPFEMALE > patiently awaited for her mate Boaz . While waiting for your Boaz , dnt settle for ANY of his relatives : broke-az , cheap-az , lyin-az , po-az , dumb-az , cheating-az , locked up-az , good for nothin-az , lazy-az , married-az , and especially his 3rd cousin beat yo-az . 
So my cousin died of an overdose on heroin a few weeks ago and I just found out a friend of his died of an overdose on over the counter drugs and alcohol . < PROPFIRST>'s death wasn't a suicide , but as for his friend < PROPFIRST > , I'm unsure . I've only met him once at my cousin's funeral . If your feeling like this is it , this is THE END please call 1-800-273-TALK ( 1-800-273-8255 ) . Or you can call me : 559-816-1677 . I'll ALWAYS be there to help to the best of my ability . Don't be afraid . Don't kill yourself . 
Heh , would you look at that ? A silver lining . [: 
Soooo when I get < PROPMALE > I'm gonna buy a robot whose only function is to go wherever I go and agree with everything I say . 
I GOT THE CINEMA CLASS !!! =D I now officially have 5 classes . I wonder if I should take another class ... 
Soooo tomorrow I'm gonna wear my I & hearts ; SF shirt , my I & hearts ; SF sweatshirt , and my Giant's cap . I hope someone asks me where I'm going ;]

Dies : < PROPFIRST > M Castillo - Obviously due to LACK OF COMMUNICATION 
I just finished watching Tangled for the first time . It was so cute ! 
Anyone know what WTG stands for ? I keep thinking it means \what the goat\ " but I may be wrong . " 
There's something about < PROPFIRST > Cash that makes me want to scream at strangers , \MY NAME IS < PROPFEMALE > ! HOW DO YOU DO ?!? NOW YOU GONNA DIE ! \ " ... I've been reading all day long about how insane people are . I'm feeling quite reckless at the moment . " 
I just took a 300 question personality test . I scored a 13 in modesty , a 92 in achievement-striving , and a 2 in self-consciousness ( each out of 100 ) , which means I * know * I'm the shit and I excel at being just that , and I don't give a damn what others think about me ;) 
This lady tried to sell me free magazines -- for just $4.99 a week -.- 
Not much of a cat person , but I really want one just so I can name it Voldemort . Best cat name ever ! 
OKAY I HAVE A PHONE AGAIN . NEW NUMBER - 415.786.4566

Today was one of those rare kick ass good days :)
