I love the feeling after a great workout . Especially when you've got a friend right next to you doing the same thing , and who at least for that moment of blood sweat and pain , completely understands you . And you feel fulfilled for having completed something worthwhile , even if it's completely personal , and achieve that happiness that takes quite a while to fade :) 
< PROPFIRST > Sandler's girlfriend's name in Big Daddy is < PROPFEMALE > !? That freakin lucky guy ...
