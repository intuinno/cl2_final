Damn it ! All that music Screwed me again . >:/ 
' Tales from Topographic Oceans ' , ' Ummagumma ' , and ' Lumpy Gravy ' have been my means of entertainment for the past 2 months . Great albums for people who like music of the Avant-Garde/Art Rock nature . 
I saw Inception yesterday . ( old news , I know ) It was pretty alright for a Dicrappio movie . If you have 2 hrs . and 45 < PROPFEMALE > . to spare I'd recommend it . Be prepared for massive amounts of filler though .

Heathen's Evolution of Chaos is Seriously the best Thrash Metal album to come out in decades . 
I've been working on my solfege and ear training . Not to mention sight reading for guitar and keyboard . I've got to admit , hard work pays off . I can sing out a perfect A# on command . 8 ) I'm also learning Bach's \little\ " fugue in G minor ( BWV 578 ) on keyboard and making an electric and classical guitar transcription . I love summer . So much time to noodle around . College theory is going to be so much fun ! :) "
