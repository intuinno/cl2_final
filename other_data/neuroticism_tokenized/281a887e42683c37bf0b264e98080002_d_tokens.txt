\You shall rejoice in everything good thing which the Lord your God has given to you . \ " . Deuteronomy 26:11 NKJV " 
The color of my bra is pink . 
God is on my mind because he is my heaven father . 
The POW WOW is on my because you go hard when we are talk about Jesus Christ . 
The POW WOW from yesterday is on my mind becuase is was funny . 
On this day , God wants you to know ... that the voice of God is best heard in silence . All too often loud events and daily busyness cloud your vision of God . Take some time to slow down ; let there be silence , let there be peace . Calm your mind and let your inner voice re-emerge from the silence . 
God I give myself away so you can use me . 
Haiti is on my mind . So can y'all go out in donate sometime to Haiti on this website SOShelpforHaiti.org . Haiti need food , clothes , andmedical supplies 
God you are good and your mercy is forever . God love you so much , and their is nothing like you . 
God you are good and your mercy is forever . God I love you so much .
