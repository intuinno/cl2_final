Hope everyone has a super awesome and super safe New Years happy time !! I wish everyone a fabulous 2010 , especially to my parents who I am so sad to say are moving to Ft Lauderdale . I love you both so much and will miss you like crazy . It's so sad to think I won't be able to see you when I want now ... 

This is so strange ... it's like one super long conversation ...

The only poopy thing is the day is almost gone ! I wanted to go for a walk with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ... might still though . 
Is sad that this is < PROPFIRST>'s last day of not working . What the hell am I going to do ? THANK GOD for my parents !!! Aunt < PROPFEMALE > and Grandma , come over whenever ! 
Got a little bit of sleep last night . < PROPFEMALE > is still sleeping so I am going to try and join her before she gets up . Seriously , this is tough !!! I'm exhausted like all the time ! 
Actually got some sleep !! It's 11:20 a.m. and I'm not completely dead to the world !! I might be able to shower and go on that walk ! Or maybe I'll just relax instead ... =) 
The Rommels ( The band < PROPFIRST > is in ) is playing out at the Ocean Club Bar this weekend on Saturday Sept . 5th , MY BIRTHDAY !! So if anyone has plans at the beach you should come by to check them out and wish me a happy birthday and if you dont have any plans this weekend now you do !!! Hope to see all my buddies there !

Sunday is moving day ! We need help !! Beer and pizza is the thank you !!! Pleeeease !!! 
The move went GREAT ! Thanks SO much to great family and friends !!! 
Measure me in metered lines And one decisive stare The time it takes to get from here to there Rely a bit too heavily On alcohol and irony Get clobbered on by courtesy In love with love and lousy poetry And I'm leaning on this broken fence Between past and present tense And I'm losing all those stupid games That I swore I'd never play But it feels okay And I'm leaving with goodbye-Some lyrics 
Enjoying a day with the munchkin . She's the best ! I'm just crazy about her ! 
Had breakfast with the fam this mornin ' . Blueberry crepes , turkey sausage and grands cinnamon buns ! I don't cook healthy breakfasts on Sundays Haha can you tell ? The baby is sleeping and I'm doin laundry and cleaning ! And of course , < PROPFIRST > is watching football .

When you think you have nothing just remember , as long as you have family you have everything . 
Don't follow in my foot steps , I walk into walls ! Seriously !! 
I really hate it when you wake up refreshed and ready to face the day , only to then discover you've only been asleep for 2 hours 
Love and life are like one big jigsaw puzzle , some days the pieces go together perfectly while other days they just don't seem to fit in place at all . 
belives in treating others how you want to be treated ... which is why I sexually harass my husband all the time . 
I love the smell of FRIDAY's first thing in the morning , I love it even more at 8:00 pm . when the munchkin is asleep and Mommy can have a drink ! :) 
I don't wanna grow up , cause I'm a Toys R Us kid ... There's a million toys at Toys R Us that I can play with ! From bikes to trains and video games , it's the biggest toy store there is ! Gee Whiz ! I don't wanna grow up , cause baby if I did I wouldn't be a Toys R Us kid !

To exhausted to think straight from coughing all night ... please use small words . Pictures help . 
One can't express the feeling you get while watching your munckin play and laugh then suddenly stop , face 6 shades of red and grunting . You are left overwhelmed that a smell like that could come from something so small and you have to be elbow deep in it . 
I LOVE my Mom ! Say Thank You to your Mom for helping you be the great person you are today by posting this to your status ! What would we ever do without our MOMS ? You ROCK < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
if I stand on my tip-toes , I can see the weekend from here !

Neighbors upstairs , though very nice in person , are the loudest people I have ever lived under !! Their two dogs run back and forth like a heard of buffalo . I have had to go up there at 1:30 in the morning on a weeknight because of it . I've called the office a few times but to no aval . Seriously , could people try to be a little more considerate ???

I watched the President today and well .. I might anger my parents for this but I like him . He's logical and understanding . I'm a fan . 
So I'm drying my hair but would come out and check < PROPFEMALE>'s cereal situation and refill . I noticed she was going through them more quickly than usual . I then saw in the mirror Mulligan sitting right next to her and one by one she was feeding them to him so I called him and he went into the closet and sure enough right behind him < PROPFEMALE > with another puff . She walked out and two seconds later she came with another one . 
Is it weird that I'm afraid of today ? 
Glad we made it through the weekend . Scary scary times . Scary because our apartment was so dirty !!! We're SO dirty !!! 
My old sunken bed beckins me . I must go to it before I get wipped . G'Night . 
Working out makes my body hurt so much . I know it's a good thing , but it sure doesn't feel good !!! 
Soup beans and corn bread ... MMmmmm !!! Then a walk with < PROPFEMALE > when she wakes up in my bobo shape ups !!! Check out my ass when I walk by cause it's lookin fine !!!! Hahaha 
No more downers !!! Can't handle it !! Suck it up and get happy damnit ;) 
Me and the kid are walking around the apartment in our underwear/ bra and diaper ( you guess who's wearing what ! ;) Hahaha ) cause it's friggin ' 80 in here ! I have it set on 76 like always . What the crap ?? 
A/C fixed . Still warm but cooling off slowly . I'm stuck in this apartment though . Have fun for me this weekend people !

Cleaning your house while your child is awake is like eating oreo's and brushing your teeth at the same time ... extremely difficult and a little chewy . 
I like it on the kitchen counter , on the computer desk , in the back seat of the car , on the vanity and sometimes on the recliner . ;)
