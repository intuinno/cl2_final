I hate when I seem like an asshole ... and when it's entirely warranted , even though I didn't mean it ... sorry 
Do you ever find yourself standing in one of the rooms in your house ... and you cant remember why you went in there ... 
You know when you've been eating ice cream too fast and you get that frozen spot in the back of your throat , but you can't do anything about it because you can't reach it to rub , it you just have to kind of wait for it to go away ... and it does ... then what do you do .. EAT MORE ICE CREAM !! What are we fucking stupid ! 
Hooray for math class where i get to sit on facebook for an hour and 10 minutes because i've already taken calc twice 
A synonym is a word you use when you can't spell the other one .

This whole choosing what i want to do for the rest of my life really sucks ... 
Oh god how much I love procrastinating and writing papers last minute , and then i realize i have to get up early ... 
Anyone wanna go to < PROPFEMALE>'s ? 
Why do so many people need help ? Life is not that complicated . You get up , you go to work , you eat 3 meals , you take one good shit and you go back to bed ... What's the fuckin mystery ? 
Ok so maybe sleeping on the chair instead of the floor wasn't such a good idea after all ...

Accept nothing , challenge everything . 
\I live on both sides of the fence . My grass is always green . \"" 
Why are we forced to take western civ in college ... i already took 11 years of history i didn't need another one 
\Do you believe in God ? \ " \ " No . \ " Boom ! Dead . \ " Do you believe in God ? \ " \ " Yes ... \ " \ " Do you believe in my God ? \ " \ " No . \ " Boom ! Dead . \ " My god has a bigger < PROPMALE > than your god ! \ " \ 
\Cannibalism . Imagine that : chowing down on another human being . You \ 
i love < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > <3 
\Don't\ 
History is not about who's right . It's about who's left .

Rise above oneself and grasp the world .

I done told you once , you son-of-a-bitch , I'm the best there's ever been . 
1 presentation plus 4 classes plus three finals equals the end of the semester in 8 days 
Procrastinating for one last time this semester . Still got ten hours till the presentation is due , my money is on me not finishing till at least 2 . 
Finally finished , thank god I practiced procrastinating in high school . 
You're a peppy little spit-fuck , aren't you ?

Dinner with the family . 
The only easy day ... was yesterday . 
Done with my first semester ! Packing up and heading home . Can't wait to see my family and my dogs . 
Something is wrong with this stat line for Peyton Manning :\ 
3 rush attempts ( first of all he should never be running)\ 
25 yards\ 
8.3 yards per attempt\ 
Long of 27 yards\ 
Long of 27 and 25 total , way to be Peyton Manning . 
What was the greatest thing before sliced bread ..? 
Well , I take whatever I want . \ 
And baby , I want you . \ 
You give me something I need . \ 
Now tell me I got something for you . 
We're Americans , with a capital ' A ' , huh ? You know what that means ? Do ya ? That means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world . 
Don't look at me in that tone of voice . 
Shoot first , shoot later , shoot some more , and when everyone's dead try to ask a question or two . 
Only one class not canceled , oh well i'll gladly take class over 4 
Life is about making mistakes . \ 
And death is about wishing you made a whole lot more . 
I wish I understood how I could have done so well last semester yet have zero confidence in having a repeat performance this time around . 
Calc test at 10 , this could be interesting ... 
Here we go ! 
Yet another test passed with much due credit to my ti-89 
i really should stop procrastinating 
this is complete bullshit ... 
had a horrible day , regardless of the fact that it's < PROPFIRST>'s day , thank god it is almost over and lets hope the semester begins to take a turn for the best . 
Let's hope I'm as good at multiple choice tests as I think I am ... 
98 on my Calc test ... damn , was hoping for the 100 
Correction , math teacher added wrong , shocker right . got a 103 on said math test . 
Halo Reach has probably one of the better campaigns I've played in a long time . 
The Colts have released < PROPMALE > Sanders ... this is a sad day =\\ 
Anger management may be a good idea were it not for the fact that people who try to get in my head piss me off ... Anyone else see a problem here ..? 
I finally caught up to the rest of the world and watched < PROPFIRST > Sheen's interview and I must say it was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time . 
That quick half hour oil change is going on 2 hours now , what a great start to my day ... =\\ 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen's Winningest Moments\ 
Tonight at 10:30 / 9:30 c on Spike\ 
I wonder how hilarious this could turn out to be ... 
i like my man with a hairy beard <3 
Knowledge is a blessing or a curse depending on your willingness to use it when it matters . 
I love being at the shore where we are only getting rain . No more snow ! 
< PROPFIRST > Kornheiser was just singing Friday lmao 
Do or do not . There is no try . 
Why do colleges insist on hiring professors who can't speak english ..? 
Why is everything in college due at the exact same time , and just happens to also correspond to any plans outside of school as well . 
So is it sad that I procrastinated to a point where my class got the teacher to postpone the due date , then I procrastinated till that due date as well ..?
