Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before , how infinitely < PROPMALE > and beautiful life is in every way , and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever ... 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . Discover . \ " , 2009-08-02 22:42:50 "

Greatest man in history , named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master . Had no degree , yet they called him Teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called him Healer .

He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . ~ Re-post if you believe with your heart

( stole this from a friend ) The Weather Channel says yesterdays east coast earthquake was caused by an unknown fault line running under D.C. and through < PROPFEMALE > . It is now being called Obama's Fault , though Obama will say it's really Bush's Fault . Another theory is that it was the founding fathers rolling over in their graves , but I believe what we all thought was an earthquake was actually the effects of a 14.6 trillion dollar check bouncing in Washington ... 
A 15 year old girl holds hands with her 1 year old son . People call her a slut , no one knows she was raped at 13 . People call another Guy fat . No one knows he has a serious disease causing him to be overweight . People call an old man ugly . No one knew he had a serious injury to his face while fighting for our country in the war . Re-post this if you are against bullying and stereotyping . I bet 95% of you won't

At a WalMart store , a cashier hands this little boy some money back . The boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old . The Cashier said , ' I'm sorry , but you don't have enough money to buy this doll . ' ... Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him , '' Granny , are you sure I don't have enough money ? '' The old lady replied , '' You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll , my dear . '' Then she asked him to stay there for just 5 minutes while she went to look around . She left quickly . The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand . A lady walked toward him and asked him who he wished to give this doll to . ' It's the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for Christmas . She was sure that < PROPFEMALE > Claus would bring it to her . ' She replied to him that maybe < PROPFEMALE > Claus would bring it to her after all , and not to worry . But he replied back sadly . ' No , < PROPFEMALE > Claus can't bring it to her where she is now . I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there . ' His eyes were so sad while saying this , ' My Sister has gone to be with God . Dad dy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too , so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister . '' My heart nearly stopped . The little boy looked up at the lady and said , ' I told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet . I need her to wait until I come back from the mall . ' Then he showed her a very nice photo of himself . He was laughing . He then told me ' I want mommy to take my picture with her so she won't forget me . ' ' I love my mommy and I wish she didn't have to leave me , but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister . ' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes , very quietly . She quickly reached for her wallet and said to the boy . ' Suppose we check again , just in case you do have enough money for the doll!'' OK ' he said , ' I hope I do have enough . ' She added some of her money to his without him seeing and they started to count it . There was enough for the doll and even some spare money . The little boy said , ' Thank you God for giving me enough money!' Then he looked at the lady and added , ' I asked last night before I went to sleep for God to make sure I had enough money to buy this doll , so that mommy could give it to my sister . He heard me!'' ' I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white < PROPFEMALE > for my mommy , but I didn't dare to ask God for too much . But He gave me enough to buy the doll and a white < PROPFEMALE >.'' ' My mommy loves white < PROPFEMALE > s . ' A few minutes later , the boys granny returned and the lady left with her basket . She finished her shopping in a totally different state of mind from when she started . She couldn't get the little boy out of her mind . Then she remembered a local newspaper article two days ago , which mentioned a drunk man in a truck , who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl . The little girl died right away , and the mother was left in a critical state . The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-sustaining machine , because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma . Was this the family of the little boy ? Two days after this encounter with the little boy , The woman read in the newspaper that the young woman had passed away . She couldn't stop herself as she bought a bunch of white < PROPFEMALE > s and went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was for people to see and make last wishes before her burial . She was there , in her coffin , holding a beautiful white < PROPFEMALE > in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest . She left the place , teary-eyed , feeling that her life had been changed forever . The love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still , to this day , hard to imagine , and in a fraction of a second , a drunk driver had taken all this away from him . Now you have 2 choices : 1 ) Send this message to others , or 2 ) Ignore it as if it never touched your heart . The quote of the month is by < PROPFIRST > Leno , ' With hurricanes , tornados , fires out of control , mud slides , flooding , severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to the other , and with the threat of swine flu and terrorist attacks , Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance ? ' For those who prefer to think that God is not watching over us delete this , for the others , pass it on ! God Bless You ; 
On September 31st , 2011 Facebook will start charging you for your account . To avoid this , you MUST get NAKED , stand on your dining room table and do the Macarena , all the while singing ”I Will Survive” . After filming and posting it to your Facebook wall and YouTube , then , and only then , will Mark Zuckerberg come down your chimney to tell you that your account will stay free . Pass it on , it must be true because someone on Facebook I hardly know told me ! 
I am tired of being sick and feeling like crap ...... just wish I could get better :/
