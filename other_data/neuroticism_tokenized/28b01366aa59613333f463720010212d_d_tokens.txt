Way too tired ... I think I can stay awake till midnight eastern time ... maybe :) And thanks to all you people who kept me awake all night laughing and allowed me one hour of sleep :) 

Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! Sniff , sniff ... I have a friend ! :) 
Oh goodness ... < PROPFEMALE > Nettles as a stalker ... Funny funny video ... 
< PROPFEMALE > !!!!!!!!!! 
in oregon , theres heat and rain . in idaho , theres heat and wind and thunderstorms . so much fun ! 
I thought I had never watched Pirates of the Caribbean , and I was wrong . I've seen the beginning of it . How can I be such an idiot ??? 
And now the dumb DVD is skipping !!! Dumb rented movie ... 
Pendleton , here we are ! FINALLY , no farting brother to stink up the car anymore . Now I just have to worry about that problem when I go to bed tonight ... Oh joy ... 
I'm ready to be at home in my own bed ... And to not be in a hotel instead ... 
Its funny how singing < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > songs down the freeway makes time go by faster ... 
You know you're home when you forget to feed the dog and you have more stuff to unload out of the car . 
I am tired and annoyed and happy and excited and ... confused by all of that ... I think I better go to bed earlier tonight .... 
Its not right to be in a classroom before the school year has even started ! 
FINALLY watched the rest of Pirates of the Caribbean . One of the best movies ever !!! Thanks for letting me borrow the movies , Vampire and Sherlock . You might not get them back . :) 
Finally get to relax after an afternoon of innertubing , knee boarding , and watching people wipe out on water skiis with some of my buddies . Fun fun time . :) 
My cat attacked my arm 5 minutes ago and he is now sleeping soundly on my bed . Weird cat ... 
Hoping that I will be able to sleep without any interuptions tonight ... I need it . 
Does the pain weigh out the pride , And you look for a place to hide , Did someone break your heart inside , You're in ruins ... 
I'm on my way , home sweet home ... 
Its nice and < PROPFEMALE > outside . And I'm in my room on the computer doing nothing . Go lazy days !!! 
Can't stop listening to Just The Way You Are by < PROPMALE > Mars . Its too addicting . Of course , I think a lot of songs are addicting . 
Hold on baby you're losing it , the water's high you're jumping into it , and letting go and no one knows ... 
Super annoyed when someone texts you , you answer , then they decide to never answer your question . And to make it better , they're on FB the same time as you and when you try to send them a message , they log off !!!! GRRR !!!!!! 
Having a Whose Line Is It Anyway ? marathon from recorded episodes off the dvr . One of the BEST shows ever ! 
One of the best ways to waste time yet be entertained : mylifeisaverage.com . 
Surprisingly already tired and am ready for tomorrow ! 
SPARE CHANGE . \ 
Enough said . 
Had the BEST time the past two days with some crazy friends !!! And school starts tomorrow ..... Can't wait to see what craziness lies ahead this year ! 
And I just now found out that my bus is coming 10 minutes earlier in the morning but the afternoon ride is still the same . I don't wake up any earlier !!!! 
Rain ... A headache ... Homework ... Late bus ... Not a great way to start the school year . At least I have a few classes with my friends . 
Nickelback is an awesome band ... Am hooked to I'd Come For You at the moment ... 
Figured out something new on iTunes ! And I am super super happy ! And that sounds really sad and pathetic ... 
Just watched the saddest Criminal Minds ever . 
I want to listen to pirate music .... 
Wiped out from yesterday . Almost slept on the way home last night . Slept great when I got home and then what happens ? I wake up early ! Today will be great ... 
Watching the Duck game ! 
Ducks won ! :) \ 
Beavers lost . :( 
If no one will listen when you decide to speak , If no one is left standing after the bombs explode , If no one wants to look at you for what you really are , I will be here still ... 
I'm ready for the weekend already ... \ 
Why is it today i had to go crazy with tiredness ? 
People say they understand how you feel . But do they really understand ? \ 
Doubt it . 
I want it to be tomorrow ... Then Monday ... 
Is it over yet , \ 
Can I open my eyes , \ 
Is this as hard as it gets , \ 
Is this what it feels like to really cry ... 
Arby's sandwich . Yummy . :) 
Watched the video < PROPFIRST > made with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . My mom had to ask if I was laughing at the end . I was . :) Haha good job you guys . :) 
And now going to < PROPFEMALE>'s party ! 
Great ... < PROPFIRST > Bieber on the VMA's ... 
Its so great to talk about glitter fights .... 
I hate not knowing . 
Its that time of week again .................................................................................... \ 
\ 
New music day on iTunes !!! 
Rain ... Rain ... And rain ... 
Life ain't hard but it's too long to spend it like a country song ... 
I got this . 
Sick and not feeling good at all . :( \ 
Going to Portland tomorrow , so go away dumb cold !!! 
In Portland and have seem too many Duck and Beaver cars to count . 
Had an awesome day , DUCKS AND BEAVERS WON !!!!! Called a Mini Cooper a Mini Cruiser , and now say \Bea-CHEW !!! \ " when I sneeze . Wonderful day . :) " 
Hmmm ..... I want to watch the Vampires Suck trailer for some random reason .... 
If you don't care , you don't care . If you do care , just show that you do before they walk away . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > on Invitation Only !!! One of the best ways to spend a Sunday night ! \ 
If you don't know where you're goin , you might end up somewhere else ... 
Till now I always got by on my own\ 
I never really cared until I met you\ 
And now it chills me to the bone\ 
How do I get you alone ? \ 
That song has been stuck in my head for the past hour ... 
Today I have figured out what job I will have : updating people's iPods . 
Hmmmmm ...... I have a few things on my mind .... \ 
Zach : stay safe . \ 
Glee is on in five minutes . ( and I'm pretty sure < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can't wait to watch it :) \ 
I do not like graphs . At all . \ 
COOKIES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Some of the random things my mom says is just crazy ... 
Criminal Minds ... Or Modern Family .... \ 
I choose both . :) DVR's rock !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
The guy on criminal minds is really creeping me out ... I'm gonna have nightmares . Wonderful . 
Thought that I would hate today with having to do the skit in honors ... But I was wrong . That was one of the best class periods EVER . I GOT TO WEAR AMAZING GLASSES !!! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Very sad .... < PROPFEMALE > Underwood is performing at the < PROPFEMALE > Garden this Saturday and tickets are still on sale and I wanna go but pretty sure I can't!!! Sniff ... 
Another awesome day . :) \ 
I met Indiana Jones ! \ 
Mom's are awesome . \ 
Going to the football game tonight ! 
Just saw one kid in a McDonald's fries costume , another in a hamburger costume , and four guys in dresses . All at the track meet . Today is one weird day . 
One word to describe the past 24 hours : AWESOME . 
September is cancer month : In memory of every cancer patient , family member and friend who has lost their battle with cancer , and in honor ofthose who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste , I did . Will you ? 
Today was awesome !... except for getting two huge bruises on my leg from slipping off a trailer ... oh well ... SUPER SUPER EXCITED FOR HOMECOMING !!! :) But more excited for the parade !!! 
I see your face every time I dream , \ 
On every < PROPFEMALE > , every magazine , \ 
So wild and free , so far from me , \ 
You're all I want , my fantasy ... \ 
\ 
Love this song !!!!!! 
Just heard < PROPFIRST>'s Girl on the TV and thought of only one thing : dancing to < PROPFEMALE>'s house after the football game last week . :) 
SUPER EXCITED FOR HOMECOMING !!! I think I'm gonna start a countdown ..... So from now ... 6 days ... CAN'T WAIT !!! :) 
Really tired , got back from pirate shopping 30 minutes ago , and still need to finish the lab write-up for chemistry tomorrow . Wonderful . \ 
5 DAYS !!! 
Today's assembly was awesome ! We're in second place so far behind the Seniors . Can't wait for next week !!! :) \ 
4 days !!!!! \ 
I AM FIRED UP !!! 
\You put 200 < PROPMALE > on my car !!! \ " \ 
Go Ducks and Beavers !!!!!!! \ 
3 days !!! 
DUCKS AND BEAVERS WON THEIR GAMES !!!!!!!!! AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!! 
And my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say , \ 
May have lost this battle , live to fight another day , \ 
But don't be falling in love as she's walking away ... 
Working today makes me feel excited for tuesday and very annoyed at the same time . \ 
2 Days !!! 
Next time I say I'm gonna make a last minute playlist for a float , talk me out of it . Or at least get other people who keep coming up with ideas for songs get off their butts and have them make it themselves . \ 
1 day !!! 
Can't decide if today was a good day or bad day . Plus side : we beat the seniors in the float competition and are super close to winning the homecoming competition . Minus side : it's been exactly one year since my grandpa passed away and when I got home , I found out my dad had to put to sleep our 11-year-old lab . 
Its amazing how little kids and a jack-in-the-box can change ur mood so easily . 
Love those days when you're lazy and move at your own pace . Today is one of those days . I need it . 
Going to the dance after staying up to 11 all week and running on 7 and a half hours of sleep is not fun . But singing Bleeding Love is . 
School tomorrow ... Bleh ... 
I'd go back in time to change it , but I can't ... \ 
So if the chain is on your door , I understand ... 
Don't make me mad and I won't give you a death glare . \ 
Simple as that . 
Watching < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > . I now really want to read the series again ... Go four day weekends ! 
Who's going to the game tonight ? 
Toughgirls come from NEW YORK , sweet girls come from TEXAS , < PROPFEMALE > girls come from CALIFORNIA , But us OREGON girls have fire & ice in our blood , we can ride 4-wheelers , be a < PROPFEMALE > , throw a right hook , love football , fish with the boys , bake a cake , be great moms , party ... and ... Love with a passion , And if we have an opinion , U KNOW YOU ARE GONNA HEAR IT !!! Copy and paste if you are a Oregon girl !! 
is listening to sad songs . Currently listening to : Why by Rascal Flatts . 
Now I can't laugh , can't cry ... \ 
And I can't run , can't hide ... \ 
What do I gotta do , what do I gotta do to keep you , \ 
What do I gotta do to keep you from doing this to me ... 
So tomorrow is a late start and I have to be at school by 6:45 ... \ 
Does this make sense to anyone ??????????? 
At this moment , there is only one thing to say ... \ 
I LOVE MY DUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Watching my dad trying to play on the Wii Fit makes my day . 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% won't post this as their status- be one of the 3% and post this as your status . Do it for at least an hour , for those who have died of cancer or for those who are still fighting . ? 
She would change everything for happily ever after , \ 
Caught in the inbetween , a beautiful disaster ... 
I hate when the power goes out ... 
The thunder rolls and the lightnin ' strikes \ 
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night \ 
As the storm blows on out of control \ 
Deep in her heart , the thunder rolls ... 
My poor baby girl ( aka < PROPFIRST > bear ) is freaked out by the thunder . Can't wait till she hides in the shower again . 
I will dry your eyes , I will fight your fights , I will hold you tight and I won't let go ... \ 
Absolutely love this song :) 
Crazy crazy week ... My day was made thanks to Captain < PROPFIRST > Sparrow . :) \ 
And one crazy weekend coming up !!! \ 
Can't wait !!!!!! 
Sooooooooooooooooooooo tired ... \ 
But soooooooooooooooooooo excited at the same time . 
I hate it when i think i make people feel bad . 
I am taking all of the mirrors out of our house and throwing them all outside , then making sure no one goes near them . 
My cat decided to run up the stairs , throw up on every stinkin step , and let me clean it all up afterwards . And to thank him , I threw him outside . 
Look what I got ! I gotta a jar of dirt , I gotta jar of dirt , and guess what's inside it !!!! 
But on second thought , tonight I think I hate everything ... 
I . Hate . Internet . 
FINALLY things are going my way . 
The more I think about it , the more I wish I was in Idaho 
I guess it's gonna break me down\ 
Like fallin ' when you try fly\ 
It's sad but sometimes\ 
Moving on with the rest your life\ 
Starts with goodbye ... 
I REALLY want it to be tomorrow night so I can watch the CMA Awards !!! \ 
And also so that I can sleep in the next day . :) 
Song of the Day : Welcome to My Life . \ 
Great song . 
Just because I know a lot of country songs does not mean that I am a sick freak or a computer . Country music is just my forte . :) 
CMA AWARDS ARE ON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
And if weren't guys like you there wouldn't be songs like this ... \ 
Love < PROPFEMALE > Underwood ! :) 
I'd come for you , no one but you\ 
Yes , I'd come for you , but only if you told me to\ 
I'd fight for you , I'd lie , it's true\ 
Give my life for you\ 
You know I'd always come for you ... 
We think about tomorrow then it slips away , oh , yes it does\ 
We talk about forever but we've only got today\ 
And the days go by\ 
I can feel ' em flying like a hand out the window when the cars go by\ 
It's all we've been given , so you better start livin'\ 
You better start livin'\ 
Better start livin ' right now ... 
Already fed up and mad and the week has barely started . Wonderful . 
So if nobody cares , what's the point in trying ? 
Seriously confused and has no idea what is going on at the moment ... and hoping that I didn't sound very mean either ... 
According to my dad , he is the \cool < PROPFIRST > guy next door \"..." 
Ready for a LONG break from school . 
IT'S A RAINBOW !!!!! 
I want to be loved like that , \ 
A promise you can't take back , \ 
If you're gonna love me , \ 
I want to be loved like that ... 
Oh , I know you can hear me\ 
But I'm not sure you're listening\ 
I hear what you're sayin'\ 
But still there's somthing missin'\ 
Whether I go , whether I stay\ 
Right now depends on whatever you say ... 
Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire ? \ 
Would you hold on to me tighter , as the summer sun got higher ? \ 
If we roll from town to town , and never shut it down ? \ 
Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover ? \ 
Would we walk even closer , until the trip was over ? \ 
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way ... 
Happy Birthday , Dad !!! You may not have a facebook , but I'm saying it on here anyway . :) Love you !!!!! 
Life on the < PROPFEMALE > couldn't be any stranger , \ 
Life on the < PROPFEMALE > wouldn't feel this far away ? \ 
The life that I knew is through\ 
And I'm gonna need you more than ever , \ 
I'm alone in this crowded room , \ 
Its like life on the < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Who's there to save the hero , \ 
When she's left all alone\ 
And she's crying out for help , \ 
Who's there to save the girl , \ 
After she saves the world ... 
So don't give up now , you're so close to a brand new day , \ 
Yes , you are , \ 
And if you just can't bare to be alone , then I'll stay ... 
Cleaned my room and most of downstairs , moved my old dresser into the computer room , read an awesome book , relaxed , and spent time with family . I would classify that as a pretty great weekend . :) 
Where a closet used to be in my room is now a huge hole in the wall , just waiting to have shelves put in it and to be painted . Looking forward to tomorrow ! 
No matter how many FB friends you have , no matter how many people you talk to during the day , not very many people will care what you have to say , what you've done , or how you feel . A small amount of people will honestly care . Glad I know who those people are in my life . 
And I hate how much I love you , boy\ 
I can't stand how much I need you\ 
But I just can't let you go\ 
And I hate that I love you so ... 
Beavers : fight hard\ 
Ducks : fight harder and win :) 
What do you say ? The Ducks won ? What else is new ? \ 
I LOVE MY DUCKS !!! :) 
I\ 
don't need an angel on my Christmas tree . I already have one in heaven \ 
looking down on me ........ Put this on your status if there is someone \ 
in Heaven you wish could be with you this Christmas !!! 
Tell me how would you feel , \ 
You'd probably give up too , \ 
If nobody believed in you ... 
Ready for winter break ... Really need it . 
It's time to make ... A GIANT COOKIE PIZZA !!!!!!! 
Yesterday ... Can't even put into words how much fun it was ! Lip sync went great , had fun decorating the dance , and everything else that happened was just awesome ! Today was great too , can't wait to sleep in tomorrow . :) 
Obsessed , depressed at the same time\ 
I can't even walk in a straight line\ 
I'm a light in the dark , no sunshine\ 
No sunshine , no sunshine ... 
There ain't nobody who can comfort me , oh yeah , \ 
Why won't you answer me ? \ 
The silence is slowly killing me , oh yeah ... \ 
Kind of on a Maroon 5 kick right now :) 
So glad tomorrow is Friday !!! And yet I have to wake up early ..... No Bueno . 
Pretty sure I'm getting sick ... Have a sore throat and really tired ... But at least today was a good day . So glad it's winter break . :) 
Thank you , thunderstorm , for waking me up from my peaceful sleep with your thunder and hail . 
Watching Pretty Woman and eating fudge ... Awesome way to end an awesome day . :) 
Getting ready to go to my granny's house for her birthday . Can't wait to see the family . :) 
Once upon a time there was light in my life \ 
But now there's only love in the dark \ 
Nothing I can say \ 
A total eclipse of the heart ... 
Today : Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , saw my cat play in a plastic bag , got new wireless internet , went back to Best Buy to fix the router for the internet , figured out I will be a Geek Squad employee , with delicious dinner and games tonight . Gotta love the holidays . :) 
Very much enjoyed yesterday . :) After waking up too early , the day got a million times better . I am now enjoying a marathon of Season 5 of Criminal Minds and am ready to wear my new duck t-shirt , much to my dad's dismay . :) Hope everyone else had a great christmas ! 
This weather is crazy ... Ton of wind and rain ... Wonderful ... 
Oh so very confused ... and I don't like it at all . 
Even though I'm feeling so right , \ 
I'm so happy still I know\ 
I should be sleeping instead of dreaming\ 
About you ... 
Two options : finish Pride and Prejudice notes for 50 points of extra credit by tomorrow for honors or keep my sanity and get some sleep tonight . Kinda leaning towards the second one at this point ... 
Pain is hard to get out , just like paint . :) 
We ride and never worry about the fall , \ 
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all ... 
If I run , will you run after me ? \ 
If I walk , will you wait patiently ? \ 
If I fall , will you have sympathy ? \ 
If I run , if I run , \ 
Will you run after me ? 
Let no one who loves be unhappy ; even love unreturned has its rainbow . 
She loves her mama's lemonade\ 
And hates the sound that goodbye's make\ 
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her\ 
She swears that there's no difference\ 
Between the lies and compliments\ 
It's all the same if everybody leaves her ... 
If somebody could please snap their fingers and make my internet work again , it would be very much appreciated . :) 
Four days till internet access ! And i'm already having iTunes withdrawel ... 
Thank you , awesome internet-installer guy , for allowing me to go back onto iTunes once again !!! :D 
The smile on your face let's me know that you need me\ 
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me\ 
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall\ 
You say it best when you say nothing at all ... 
It's like my heart is a tooth , and it has a cavity that can only be filled with children ... \ 
Gotta love Despicable Me . :) \ 
PAPOY !!! 
So maybe you could walk with me a while\ 
Maybe I could rest beneath your smile\ 
Everybody stumbles sometimes \ 
And needs a hand to hold\ 
Cause it's a long trip alone ... 
Stutter by Maroon 5 has been stuck in my head all weekend ... At least it's a great song . :D 
I've lost count of how many times I've updated people's iPods ... 
There's once in a lifetime , and there's once in a while\ 
And the difference between the two is about a million miles\ 
Oh , you might get lucky while the < PROPFEMALE > is looking on\ 
But in the truth of the morning\ 
The stars will be long gone ... 
Singing to sappy love songs ( thanks twin ) and feeling hyper/tired ... Great way to end an awesome day . :) 
Still trying to get used to having a green room ... 
Because I'm broken when I'm open \ 
And I don't feel like I am strong enough \ 
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome \ 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away ... 
According to my dad , \nacho\ " is 3 in spanish and \ " cheeso\ " is 4 ... The things my family say ... " 
I don't want to feel better , \ 
I don't want to not remember , \ 
I will always see your face in the shadows of this haunted place , \ 
I will laugh , I will cry , shake my fist at the sky , \ 
But I will not say goodbye ... 
You know the weather's bad when a usual 15 minute trip home takes 45 minutes ... 
For the first time you can open your eyes , And see the world without your sorrow , Where no one knows the pain you've left behind , And all the peace you could never find is waiting there to hold you , keep you , Welcome to the first day of your life , Just open up your eyes ... \ 
Favorite Daughtry song at the moment . :) 
< PROPFIRST > Cook has a new song !!!!!!! \ 
My day has been officially made . :D 
I'll stand by you , I'll stand by you\ 
I won't let nobody hurt you\ 
I'll stand by you\ 
Take me in , into your darkest hour\ 
And I'll never desert you\ 
I'll stand by you ... \ 
This song is on repeat on my iPod at the moment . :) 
And I thought the weather was bad in < PROPMALE > ... 
So happy that my aunt got down here from Idaho safely . :) \ 
Can't wait until I get to see her this weekend !!! :D 
Make the world go away , \ 
And get it off my shoulders , \ 
Say the things you used to say , \ 
And make the world go away ... 
Dinner with Aunt < PROPFIRST > and the family equals lots of laughter . :) 
Mistreated , misplaced , misunderstood \ 
Miss ' No way , it's all good ' , it didn't slow me down \ 
Mistaken , always second guessing , underestimated \ 
Look i'm still around ... \ 
<3 this song 
Dancing slowly in an empty room\ 
Can the lonely take the place of you ? \ 
I sing myself a quiet lullaby\ 
Then you go and let the lonely in\ 
To take my heart again ... <3 
This was one AWESOME day . :) 
Loving the country music awards . :) \ 
But < PROPFEMALE > Underwood's performance has been THE BEST of the night . No doubt about that . :)
