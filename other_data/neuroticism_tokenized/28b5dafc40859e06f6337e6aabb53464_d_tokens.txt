Life will hopefully all make sense ... someday ... 
My heart is burning with love\ 
All can see this flame\ 
My heart is pulsing with passion\ 
like waves on an ocean . \ 
\ 
My friends have become strangers \ 
and I'm surrounded by enemies \ 
But I'm free as the wind\ 
no longer hurt by those who reproach me . \ 
I'm at home wherever I am\ 
and in the room of lovers\ 
I can see with closed eyes\ 
the beauty that dances . \ 
~ Rumi 
As I lie in bed with a cup of < PROPFEMALE > green tea , the kitties flanked beside me , listening to the relaxing sound of rain collect in the trees , I can't help but feel thankful .

I AM A HANDFUL - unfortunately most women WON'T re-post this . I'm strong willed , independent , a bit outspoken , and I tell it like it is . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle but I love and give with all my heart . If you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . If you are a HANDFUL , re-post ! I dare you .. I'll be looking for the ladies who re-post . 
Snow + laying on the couch , reading a good book = GREAT ! \
