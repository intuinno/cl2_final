Christmas is coming down very slowly . It takes a lot longer with sick babies . 
tut tut , looks like rain . tut tut . 
is trying to get new pic's up on fb to no avail ... 
Rain is so demotivating , unless you are trying to get motivated to take a nap . 
What a beautiful day !!! < PROPMALE > & I had fun at the park ! Now I just want to do some nesting . No one understands . 
No name , no baby , but his bed is ready to go ( for when he needs it in 3 months )

taking < PROPMALE > to the zoo today ; Aunt < PROPFEMALE > & Uncle < PROPFIRST > are coming too ! 
Off to the beach instead ; maybe zoo tomorrow ! 
< PROPMALE > had so much fun at the zoo today . He liked the goats and ducks the best . They're so exotic ! 
Aunt < PROPFEMALE > and Uncle < PROPFIRST > just left to head back home . I'm so glad they came to visit and sad to see them go . I miss them already ! 
Just got done sewing uniforms ; now off to bed ! 
going to Salem , NH today ; might have to stop for some Bertucci's! Yum . 
needs to clean her house before a very busy tomorrow . 
doesn't want to go to the grocery store . It's the worst . 
had a fun night at the Diemers playing Apples to Apples ! 
< PROPMALE > has a 102 fever and is not himself today , so we have to go to the doctor & make sure he's ok . 
is very sad . Punkin , my big orange cat , is MIA . He escaped from a 2nd/3rd story window . 
please come back Punkin . We miss you . 
Punkin just came home ! I'm so relieved . Now I will be able to sleep tonight . 
is bored , so I guess I'm boring . 
Cops , Cops , AMW . Lame Saturday as usual . 
can't sleep since 4 a.m. 
really loves her sweet baby boy 
slept til 8:30 because it's dark and < PROPFEMALE > outside :)

needs her critter to do a 180 . 
is getting a pedicure and her hair did this afternoon , then going out for a girls night ! 
just went out with sis for sushi and a movie ; fun night ! 
waiting for my baby boy to wake up so we can go have a picnic . 
< PROPMALE > & I just got back from our picnic at < PROPMALE > Park . 
has cankles and elephant feet . 
is wondering if babies can sleep too much ? 
is wondering if as hot there as it is here . 
is going to the beach . It's too hot to stay here . 
has a baby that's totally attached to a blanket . How did that happen ? 
is wondering if anyone has had acupuncture and can tell me that it's not as bad as I think it's going to be . 
so far the acupuncture didn't work ... 
missed my scheduled afternoon nap due to some spyware our computer picked up . Will be going to bed early tonight . 
enjoying an ice-cold delicious Vernors courtesy of Aunt < PROPFEMALE > 
uhhhhhh whatever . 
had my ultrasound today ; baby is head down ! < PROPFEMALE > happy and soooo relieved ! 
excited for my baby shower this afternoon ; get to < PROPFEMALE > out with the ladies ! 
had a lot of fun at my shower today ! Thank you so much to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
gets dropped like a hot potato every time roommate shows up . 
this house is eerily quiet without < PROPMALE > ... 
lots to finish before baby shows ... not feeling too well and lacking the motivation to get it all done . Bad time for a cold . 9ish days to go ! 
facebooks gone crazy ... showing status updates from 5 days ago and none from yesterday ? 
The Office reruns and pizza ... going to be a good night ! 
wishes < PROPFEMALE > would upgrade from ' Map ' to GPS . It's really annoying when she repeats directions 14 times . 
is ready to get down to it ; if only critter was . 
Sawyer < PROPFIRST > Ruczko arrived Thurs Sept 17th at 8:30 pm . He was 8 lbs 13 oz and 20 in long . He is a little angel and is doing great ! 
got in trouble today for doing too much too soon .... bummer . 
cannot wait for 8 p.m. to come today ! 
phewww ! 
doesn't want to go out in the wind and rain . It looks really cold from in here . 
dislikes mopping a lot ; esp when there is so much to mop . 
wants to cuddle up in bed ; it's chilly this morning ! 
a very lonely Sunday .... 
is completely disgusted with ' balloon boys ' parents . Some people are really pathetic . 
dancing with < PROPMALE > in the kitchen to T.I. 
Carters 18 month check-up today . I can't believe it . 
can't believe Sawyer has gained three pounds already ! 
two sick babies = very long day 
thinks it's sad that I feel like I won a prize bc I received the H1N1 vaccine today . 
is trying to look on the bright side . 
beyond tired , time for bed . 
to the doctors with Sawyer today ; praying they can help him keep something in his belly . 
Sawyer is smiley and gurgly this morning ; so cute ! Hope it lasts awhile . 
always out of the loop 
what's with all the shooting ? It's terrible . I'm wondering if these crazies set each other off . 
another crazy Friday night . watch out . 
is hoping Geof gets off work at a decent time so we can make it to the bonfire . 
any idea involving Taco < PROPFEMALE > is never a good idea . 
going to bed before I run out of time . 
got a horrible haircut yesterday . Why do I let people talk me into going to someone new ? 
sunset was 4:23 pm today . Gotta love being this far NE at this time of the year . 
guess there will be no walking along the coast today . Maybe I should start checking the weather . Oh well , making my < PROPMALE > french toast for breakfast . 
< PROPFEMALE > Deens homemade < PROPMALE > n cheese for dinner with smoked sausage . yummy comfort food ! 
want to power up on Flexeril and Vicodin so I can vacuum my house . 
Sawyer had his 2 mo . check today . He's already grown 4 inches and gained 5 pounds ! 
as I was walking across the living room , I tripped on < PROPMALE>'s toy drum . Now he keeps kicking it then saying \OOW ! \ " . I love when I get made fun of by my 1 1/2 year old . " 
Facebook just quit on me . I can't view news feed or chat . 
my baby slept 9 hrs straight last night ! Too bad < PROPMALE > woke up with a nightmare again . 
thinks I'm in trouble . < PROPMALE > spent all morning at church chasing after a sweet little girl . 
no trivia , no photo of the day , no chat . What up with that facebook ? 
Happy Thanksgiving to all ! Hope that everyone has a < PROPMALE > to really reflect on all they have to be thankful for . Count your blessings today and every day . 
I would very much like a cortisone injection . 
the crazy wind ripped our storm door off . 
feeling a bit stronger and thankful to not be in pain ; beautiful day and looking forward to a cookie swap later ! 
< PROPMALE > thinks it's funny to stick his cold hands and feet all over me . 
Does anyone want a set of Christmas dishes ? Service for 8 , has dinner plates , dessert plates , bowls , latte mugs , serving tray , cookie jar and salt and pepper shakers . It's Country < PROPFEMALE > by < PROPFEMALE > Winget . 
Ruined both of my tree skirts last night by washing them :( 
getting very anxious bc I need to go to the grocery store sometime today . I would rather scrub my entire shower with a toothbrush than shop on a weekend . 
got some Christmas shopping done this evening and had a nice dinner out with sis . 
is hoping this slushy mess doesn't freeze later on . I don't think I'm going to leave the house today . 
I have the best baby in the world ; he let me sleep through the whole night ! And now he's back asleep so I can take a shower in peace . 
got some more Christmas shopping done today ; the end is near , I can feel it . 
came out of the laundry room and couldn't figure out why everything smelled minty ; until I found my Burts Bees all mangled . 
going to try to make some candy-coated pretzels today and finish a little painting project ; these are the things that nap time is for . 
is wondering who the Rustic Overtones are and what has happened to alternative music . I guess it was inevitable that this day would come , I was just hoping it would come much later . 
here we go a Christmas shopping again . Hopefully the boys behave . 
already out of room under the tree ; 2 more gifts to buy and stocking stuffers then I'm done ! Just have to ship some stuff to MI 
tired of shopping .... 
one more trip to Target ( 3rd day in a row ) and I'm done ; shipping packages today . Now the house cleaning can begin :( 
doesn't want to walk to the mailbox . Too cold ! 
Maine is the 10th happiest state ; see how others rank ! http://www.livescience.com/culture/091217-happy-state-list.html 
no church this morning ; made a go at it , but the roads aren't even cleared . All dressed up and snowed in . Why aren't they plowing the side roads ? 
made peanut butter balls and they are delicious ! Tomorrow , snickerdoodles ( since I didn't make them today ) . < PROPMALE > had fun sledding with Auntie < PROPFEMALE > , and got to watch < PROPFIRST>'s Christmas < PROPFIRST > and Frosty . I love Christmas ! 
it's the most wonderful time of the year !!! 
cleaning , grocery shopping . Lucky me I have some help on the way !!! 
I don't know what I'd do w/o my church peeps . They are a great bunch . I am blessed . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !! Have a wonderful day tomorrow ! Looking forward to a nice relaxing day with family and friends and good food ( as long as I don't ruin it ) . 
is tired , but happy I got to see Cutter and Cosmo today !! I miss them but am glad they are loved and happy . 
blah , New Years . 
just wants to get back to normal . 
time to find somewhere to move to . Sooo not excited . 
white 
ran out of fuel oil , so I had a nice cold shower . And for a company to deliver same day , it's going to cost an extra $70 . Awesome . 
poor baby Sawyer has an ear infection , and now < PROPMALE > is telling me that his hurt too . 
dislikes giving Slayer his medicine . Such a pain . 
< PROPMALE > finally climbed out of his crib . Honestly I'm surprised he didn't do it sooner . Guess it's time for the toddler bed . Ugh ... 
pants on the ground , pants on the ground , lookin ' like a fool with your pants on the ground ... 
is very humbled after seeing the people of Haiti , who lives have been devastated and have lost everything , having to sleep out in the streets , singing and praising God . 
< PROPMALE > went to bed 2 hrs late , so I'm hoping he'll sleep in 2 hrs late . We'll see ... 
going to look at a house this afternoon in Wells . 
so I've been listening to this chirping noise for three days now . I think we replaced the batteries in the wrong smoke detector . 
so < PROPMALE > woke up at least 30 < PROPFEMALE > before me this morning . It gave him time to explore the third floor and get into some other shenanigans . Can't wait til the crib tent I ordered shows up . 
just doesn't understand people . 
I love my sister more than words can say . If you have a sister who is your best friend , has shared life's precious blessings with you and has also been there for you through thick and thin copy and paste this to your status . The world would not be the same without our sisters ! ? 
first P.T. appt was today . Here's hoping that it does me some good . 
Starbucks + Target clearance is my favorite way to relax these days . 
< PROPMALE > just put a movie in for himself . Scary . 
It goes without saying that you should never have more children than you have car windows . - < PROPFEMALE > Bombeck 
\My second favorite household chore is ironing . My first one being hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Bombeck " 
\Insanity is hereditary . You can catch it from your kids . \"" 
sister will be gone all week :( . On a brighter note , < PROPMALE > was singing Boom Boom Pow at church today . 
going to look at some houses this afternoon . 
To Celebrate Valentines Day , Change your Profile Picture to you and your spouse/significant other . and make sure to tell how long you've been together ! 
ahhhh !!! Stupid router is driving me crazy ! It would help if I knew what I was doing . 
6 hours of screaming baby . What a day . 
the first thing < PROPMALE > asked me this morning ; Duckies ? Ocean ? Boom boom ? I guess he has a big day planned . 
someone tell me what kind of minivan to buy . :( 
watching ' Be My < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Brown ' with < PROPMALE > and throwing around 15 red ballons . :) 
Is it Fat Tuesday there ? It isn't here ; maybe there's not a large enough Polish population . 
too bad I don't want to live in a house that smells like cigarettes and cat urine or we'd be all set . ugh . 
I'm not ready for March . 
just waiting for the boys to wake up so that I can go vacuum the new place . 
has gotten a lot done today thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > !! Thanks so much for all your help ! 
was anyone else totally weirded out by < PROPFEMALE > creeping on < PROPMALE > tonight ? 
so long internet , I will see you tomorrow . < PROPFEMALE > out . 
I got cable , phone and internet back ; and HEAT !! Yay ! Now that I'm not freezing , I should be able to get some stuff done . If only Sawyer would stop crying .... 
first night sleeping in a new house . I'm totally creeped out as usual and am considering stacking furniture in front of the doors . Would that be a little paranoid since I live in York ? Probably . 
Thanking God for the beautiful weather we've had for moving and the wonderful people that we've had helping us ! We are almost done .... 
another beautiful day !! Sawyer slept almost 10 hours straight last night , which means I got some quality sleep !!! After all this moving I think the boys and I will take the afternoon off and go feed the ducks and take a walk on Long Sands beach . 
Call me old-fashioned , but I just think that when you spend a lot of money on something , it should probably work properly . And if it doesn't , maybe the vendor should be somewhat apologetic instead of acting like it's not their problem . I'm so sick of wasting my time trying to fix things that I shouldn't have to deal with in the first place . 
so I buy a dryer and it doesn't work . I go to the laundromat and it loses power . Clean clothes are not in my near future . 
just wished everything would stop breaking !!! 
I love days like today ; playing with < PROPMALE > on the beach , beautiful sunshine , opening the windows and letting the fresh air in , and taking an afternoon nap with Sawyer . Perfect . 
As your faith is strengthened you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control , that things will flow as they will , and that you will flow with them , to your great delight and benefit . < PROPMALE > Teney 
Woke up this morning and there were 18 turkey's in my back yard !!! 
I don't know the key to success , but the key to failure is trying to please everybody . < PROPMALE > Cosby 
No person was every rightly understood until they had been first regarded with a certain feeling , not of tolerance , but of sympathy . - < PROPFIRST > Carlyle 
loves her < PROPMALE > and Sawyer SOOOO much !! I have two wonderful little boys . 
my car stereo is fixed and will be put back into my car tomorrow ; and hopefully they will also fix my RES . One small victory for used car buyers . 
four hours later , I'm hoping the car fiasco is finished . Now our 15 hr . drive to MI won't be without music and movies . 
it rained and rained , and the hundred acre wood got floodier and floodier . 
cleaning , packing , cleaning , packing ..... 
so excited to bring the boys to the park this afternoon ; less excited for grocery shopping . 
washing the blankie before nap time = not a good idea . Should have thought this through .... 
thank you 20/20 for keeping me up half the night .... 
< PROPMALE > is 2 today ! My baby is getting big . 
I have a fever but , surprisingly , cowbell didn't do anything . Now what am I supposed to do ? 
feeling a little better and trying to get some projects done while the boys are sleeping . 
\The sillies are crazy little creatures that live inside of us and need to be shaken out . \"" 
No onion is worth my tears , but they always make me cry . 
anyone else find the ' No-makeup ' look ridiculous . There's a certain way to put on your make-up to make it look like your not wearing any ? 
missing church this morning due to poor < PROPMALE>'s crazy rash . :( 
time to Rock the Catbox 
and now Sawyer has a 103 degree fever . Why must the children keep getting sick ? 
The only thing that can top off a late night of projectile baby vomit and high fever is a mad pre-midnight rush to Wal-Mart , only to get attitude from the customer service lady and find out they don't have any medicine because it's all been recalled . Ahhhhh ! I'm going to bed .... 
Happy Mother's Day all of you hard-working ladies !! 
thinks it's a good day for the park and barbeque chicken . 
Why is it that two year olds think ketchup is a side dish and have zero concept of time ? 
go to sleep little baby ..... 
thinking today is a beautiful day for the beach . 
I have the best sister in the world for shizzle ! 
a day that is begun falling down the stairs is a day best spent in bed . 
it was a beautiful morning at the beach , and I'm so happy it cooled off so much . We will sleep well tonight , hopefully . 
Sawyer finally started crawling last weekend , and now he's off exploring the house ! 
Had so much fun at the park today ; wish they would have let us see the Tall Ships , but I guess we were a day early . 
< PROPMALE > wrote a new song ; it's called ' Lamenting for the Blanket ' . 
poor < PROPMALE > misses his Daddy so much . :( 
my night = sewing and listening to Clapton . Ahhh , relaxing . 
nap time . 
the boys had so much fun at the beach yesterday . Think I might take them again tomorrow . 
lovin my new Southern Rock CD !!! 
thinks that if atheism is a religion , then not collecting stamps is a hobby . 
I have three kinds of friends : those who love me , those who pay no attention to me , and those who detest me . 
< PROPMALE > informed me earlier that Daddy is a pirate . Who knew . 
The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves , and not to twist them to fit our own image . Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > Merton 
According to < PROPMALE > , the chocolate cake is on top of the mountain , and Tico will pick us up in his car & drive us there . Too much < PROPFEMALE > I think . 
Happy Fathers Day to all of you wonderful Dads ! 
I got 7 amazing , uninterrupted hours of sleep last night . Ahhhhh feels good . 
Electricity , how I love you .... thanks for coming back to me . 
a girls night w/ sis , a day at the zoo w/ the boys , and air-conditioning at home ! It was a good weekend . Thanks hubby ! 
she won a super embarrasing trip to the grocery store courtesy of her 2 year old !!! 
Oh Sawyer , please go to sleep . Mommy needs some rest . 
we are now a ' hussy ' free household . I know there is one straggler hiding around here somewhere . Hopefully I find it before < PROPMALE > does . 
Needs some sleepy baby < PROPFEMALE > dust so I can take a shower . 
needs to snap out of it .... 
Took < PROPMALE > to feed the ducks at Raydon Rd ; turns out they weren't too hungry , but we ended up feeding a pair of snapping turtles . Who knew they like bread ? It was pretty cool . < PROPMALE > then helped me unload and load the dishwasher , make brownies , and pick up all of the toys ! The whole time he was helping with dishes he kept saying ' Thank you Mommy!' over and over . So cute . 
No matter how many other songs I listen to , I can't get Iron Man out of my head . Ahhh ! 
what a goegeous day ! I would like to take a nap outside-ish . 
So lucky to have had a wonderful friend bring me dinner AND do my dishes ! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! You're the best ! 
Why won't my kids take a nap ? I think they conspire against me .... 
had a great night with friends !! 
There are only two creatures of value on the face of the earth : those with the commitment , and those who require the commitment of others . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > Adams 
considering the weather conditions , I will be trading bbq chicken for pizza delivery . And praying that the 3/4 inch hail misses us . 
Ahh , what a lovely perfect thunderstorm to go to sleep by .... 
The only disadvantage of an honest heart is credulity . \ 
-Sir < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
my hands smell of onions , garlic , cilantro and lime . Can't wait to wave them in < PROPFEMALE>'s face all afternoon . :) 
the boys and I had a lovely 2ish mile walk down Long Sands this morning . The sun was shining , and it was breezy and cool . Perfect day . Dreading an impending trip to the packed grocery store . I saw a movie once where < PROPFIRST > Depp delivered groceries to your house . THAT would be nice . 
Well , I saw one shooting < PROPFEMALE > . Not one every minute , but the sky looked amazing , and it was really cool . 
Anyone know what you are supposed to do with Lobsters between the store and dinner time to keep them alive ? 
I finally saw a moose !! We did have to go to the Maine Wildlife Park to see it though . Also saw a mountain lion , some black bears , and a super adorable red fox . 
had a very nice ( but very brief ) visit with my Aunt < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > as they were heading back to MI from New Brunswick . So nice to see family ! Safe travels . <3 
who ever thought that I'd have to utter the words \You can not jump the baby while you are break-dancing \"." 
albondigas !! 
Just got done watching the worst movie ever . I'm too embarrassed to even say which it was . Rule of thumb ; if it stars a pop singer that you don't care for , you probably won't appreciate their acting ' skills ' either . 
< PROPMALE > just counted to eleven all by himself !! No more 3 , 6 . lol . I'm so proud of him . 
If anyone knows an easy way to get a 2 1/2 yr old and a 1 yr old to sleep in a room together , come and visit . 
Wish I was sleeping . 
all I want for Christmas is a full nights sleep , a full nights sleep ..... 
had homemade lobster rolls for dinner . YUM !! Any of my ME/NH friends know if there is a good apple orchard around ? I'm feeling so Fall-ish . It's my favorite time of the year !! 
just made banana bread with struesel topping . Now to finish switching the boys summer clothes for the warmer ones . Then to prepare dinner for tonight . Oh and clean , clean . Better get off Facebook . 
we had a great morning at Pierce Island Park . < PROPMALE > made lots of friends and found some seashells . Hitting a road marker on the way home kind of put a damper on things . 
bakin ' my baby's birthday cake . Can't believe he'll be 1 tomorrow !! Excited to see my bestie and celebrate my little guys first year . 
Happy 1st birthday to my beautiful bald blue-eyed little boy !! You are such a sweet and cuddly baby and it's a joy being your mama ! I love you Sawyer . 
just got back from a 2 day visit ' Downeast ' to Acadia , Bar Harbor , Prospect , and Belfast with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and the boys ... it was a lot of fun . < PROPMALE > was so excited to see a real mountain . 
Park , grocery store , feed the ducks . Home for naps , then clean and cook . 
I've decided to stay in ME because if I left me and < PROPMALE > would miss my sister terribly ! 
< PROPMALE > and I prepared some apples and now they are baking ( < PROPFEMALE > Deen's recipe ) . I had so much fun making them with my little < PROPMALE > and can't wait til my whole house smells like them . :o I love the fall . 
here comes the sun , do dut do do , here comes the sun ..... 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes !! 
what a beautiful day . 
My husband is the greatest around . He treats me like a < PROPFEMALE > , and I secretively love his comic book collection . I want him to go to the store today buy some today . 
so much to do , so little motivation ..... 
Nothing says \Happy Monday ! \ " like a < PROPMALE > from the IRS . " 
Cousins are there as childhood friends and are there when we are older as forever friends . No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins ! Repost if you have cousins that make you smile !! I sure do ! 
back online . Carts keeps asking to go home in Mommy's < PROPFIRST > . :( 
In honor of Veteran's day make your profile picture one of you in your uniform or one with your significant other in his/her military uniform until after Veteran's day . Thank you to all that have served and continue to serve our country ! ? 
Happy Veterans Day to my hubby , friends and family who have/are serving !! 
twitch , twitch , twitch goes my eyelid .... 
sunshine , coffee , Sinatra's Christmas Album , and two adorable , well rested boys . Good Morning !! 
loves the sound of leaves blowing around :) 
had a fun morning at the Holyoke Mall with the family . Took the boys to Build-a-Bear , then to see < PROPFEMALE > , and a haircut for < PROPMALE > . 
some Christmas shopping today , then taking < PROPMALE > to see Tangled ! It will be his first trip to the movies ! 
Speak up for the little ones who cant be heard . Change your facebook picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on facebook until Monday the 6th of Dec . Join the fight against CHILD ABUSE , and invite your friends to do the same ! 
< PROPMALE > is \reading\ " Polar Express and singing \ " Jingle Jingle all way\ " . I'm sooo excited for this Christmas ! " 
It's going to be a great rest of the week ! Looking forward to a visit from my dear friend today , and sister this weekend !! 
spent a very rainy day with my sister and the boys baking cookies and watching Christmas movies . < PROPMALE > and Sis decorated a gingerbread house too ! We had a lot of fun . 
here we go . Let's try , try again .... 
everything is wrapped and shipped . Now time to begin the cooking . 
cleaning , laundry , sauce for lasagna , cookies , and more peanut butter balls . 
And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby , keeping watch over their flocks at night . An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the < PROPFEMALE > of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified . But the angel said to them , \Do not be afraid . I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people . Today in the town of < PROPFIRST > a Savior has been born to you ; he is Christ the Lord . \ " < PROPMALE > 2:8 -11 " 
Praying that my Maine friends all have power through this storm ; this wind is crazy ! 
finally got a good nights sleep . Now it's time to do a lot of little laundry . 
< PROPMALE > is outside w/ Geof killing whats left of their snowman . 
are we going on the second night where Sawyer won't sleep ?.... I hope not . 
you can go anywhere you like in my house .... except the west wing . It's forbidden ..... because there's no heat . 
< PROPMALE > is pretending that Sawyer is Swiper the Fox . It's nice when they can use their imaginations to have fun and embrace their toys being taken away from them by their siblings . 
why does < PROPFEMALE > dish soap smell like metal and mildew ? I even bought the apple kind in hopes of it not smelling so weird . 
True friends stab you in the front . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > Wilde 
14-18 inches of snow so far with drifts over 2 feet . < PROPMALE > is having fun outside shoveling with Geof . 
really , who wants to go grocery shopping with two little ones when it's 5 degrees outside ? Not me . I need some motivation . 
a day that starts at 2 am with 5 loads of pukey laundry , and includes a cup of pepsi spilled all over the couch , is one that I won't be sad to see come to an end . 
-20 degrees . Def . staying in today . 
laundry is put away , dishes are half finished , chicken and sausage paella is in the slow cooker . Now if I could only snag a shower , my day would be looking pretty good . 
it's soooo nice to have the windows open . 
heading out solo this morning on a search for the perfect cape fabric . 
Open up the doors \ 
and let the music play \ 
let the streets resound with singing 
My husband is the best . 
\Carter 
1-4 inches of snow ? I was hoping that was all behind us . 
I believe in the right to keep & bear arms . A Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of an individual . If you believe in the 2nd Amendment , and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this !!! I hope to see this re-posted by a lot of my friends . Guns do not kill people , people kill people .
