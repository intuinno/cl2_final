Nevermind ... 

< PROPFEMALE > , I love you but ... I'm just not any good at this game . 
is rescuing a dog right now . :D Ah , the warm feelings of dog love . P.S. Dog says hi . 
is feeling strangely obligated to refer to herself in the third person . 
wants to know why the heck the stupid snow is such a jerk . And yes I am calling the snow a jerk . 
is feeling less angry at the snow now that she's done shoveling driveways . Though it's dawning on her she has to do it tomorrow . 
thinks she is extraordinarily lucky to have the people in her life she does . Hugs for everyone ! 
< PROPFIRST > says , \This is a happy time . \ " Nothing cuter then wisdom from a babe's mouth . " 
gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ...... >_< 
is still feeling the itch to dance . 
was blissfully , peacefully happy for almost 24 hours !!! Making progress . ;D 
Oh , American History ! Why oh why are you so complicated and hard ? 
I take it back American History . You're not so bad after all . :P 
And time slowly inches itself towards Thursday ..... 
has nothing to say . And finds it a bit unerving .... 
I just stabbed myself with a fork . Now I'm bleeding all over my delicious enchilada .... 
AUGH ! Why didn't anybody tell me last minute homework was a bad idea ?! 
My brain just exploded from math overload . May it rest in peace . 
Eavesdropping in Mcdonald's = WIN . \Yeah so we drugged Victorias little brother with sleeping pills and < PROPFEMALE > Mist . Then we just sat around and drank . It was amazing ! \ " - Random 18 year-olds " 
Ugh , morning , why are you so bright and cheerful ? 
\I ... eh ... robbed a bank with a BB gun . \ " WHA ?! YOU DID WHAT ?! " 
I got mouse ears on ! Little kid crafts are the best . 
has been captured by Facebook applications ! 
< PROPFEMALE > orbs close the distance between heart and mind ; for half a minute I can breathe , manipulating atoms and universes with shaking fingertips , awe blooming < PROPFEMALE > in the darkness . I <3 < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > !!! 
Status updates don't cover epic failures . 
Owl City and snow were made for each other . <3 <3 <3 
I want to say something like \lol\ " or \ " hee hee\ " but it doesn't cover how hard I laughed or how much it hurt when I snorted all that hot chocolate up my nose . " 
SHUT UP AND GO AWAY REALITY ! NOBODY LIKES YOU ! 
Ginsberg , you blow my mind . 
If men are the hunter/gatherers , shouldn't they go get me a sandwich ? 
Really ? Really ?! Another 10-15 inches ?! It's already up to my waist ! 
I'm going to totally not comment on Valentines Day ; I absolutely refuse . You couldn't make me if ... Oh , it's too late . 
Universe , I'm really sick of your shenanigans . Shenanigans ? My poor spelling doesn't change my feelings about it .... 
Slushy snow is icky . 
Speaking of men ( < PROPFEMALE > ) , has any one seen that Wheat Thins commericial with that SUPER masculine man chasing down < PROPFEMALE > squares of ground wheat , like the true < PROPMALE > he is ? All I have to say is YES . 
Ooh mi gosh ! ( as little < PROPFIRST > would say ) 
\I'm so grumpy too ! \ " Says < PROPFIRST > grinning . " 
\AGRABLAGRABLA ! \ " < PROPFEMALE > Schwartz " 
PHOTOGRAPHY ATTACK ! MUST TAKE PICTURES OF STUFF ! 
Ah , Good Times , Good Times . 
Whoa . Apparently , if you don't update your status regularly you just STOP having one . You cease to exist . So , I stil exist guys . 
can almost whistle . Almsot . Next week : \Riding\ " a bike . " 
There is great irony to being tired , staring at a plate of cookies on the ground you just dropped , two minutes from the destination you walked in cold wind and rain to get to , while listening to \Island in the Sun\ " by Weezer . XD Life cracks me up . " 
Psh . Who needs sleep anyways ? 
Wow . The weirdly awesome things you learn on vacation . Turns out my dad was a lumberjack for a while . o . 0 
Hey , for anybody who may or may not be writing a book , never ever EVER just end the story with the would be assassins confessing ( but not getting punished ) and the would be assassinee's looking deep into each other's eyes and saying , \I love you . \ " Bleck . " 
I'm silly . > < 
Wonder Pets ! Wonder Pets ! We're on our way ! To help a baby -insert animal of choice- and save the day ! We're not too big and we're not too small , but when we work together we got the right stuff ! Go Wonder Pets ! Hooray ! Curse you children's television with your catchy ( annoying ) theme songs . 
\Why is he crying ? Eh ? Why is he crying ? \ " - Death of a Salesman Soooooooo sad . Why are there so many sad things ? ><" 
< PROPFIRST > in re-telling a tragic incident of his past to Dad , \I cried ... TO DEATH ! \ " * gasp * " 
Thinking no . cohesive no . reverting previous lifeform ... forgeting how to typ sadlkfjasdofiujfoawlefjlsdklakdjflask dfjmcowiaeurcwecn aia ; lsdk , saklfj 
I remembered how to type , but my head exploded ( unrelated to the remembering ) . This is an awkward predicament in more ways then one ..... 
Whoa . You know you're tired if your bangs are covering one eye ( and you know this ) but you still have this little panicking moment where you're trying to figure out why you're blind in one eye . I'm going to bed .... > < 
That was my last performance . OMG THAT WAS MY LAST PERFORMANCE ! THE VERY LAST ONE WITH MY FAMILY AND MY NOT FAMILY BUT PEOPLE THAT I LOVE DEARLY AND THE BEST DIRECTOR KNOWN TO MANKIND AND THE BEST DRAMA MOMMA'S ( ALSO KNOWN TO MANKIND ) AND AWESOME BEHIND THE SCENE GUYS WHO ROCK AT WHAT THEY DO AND STEP-HUSBANDS , DAUGHTERS , SONS , POKE WARS AND SPINNING IN THE SUNLIGHT IN PETTICOATS . Augh ! I already miss everyone ! 
I love my kids . They remembered Mother's Day despite the fact that I'm not actually biologically related to them at all . XD 
Gone for the weekend . Wish me luck . 
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ............................................ 
Some decisions don't seem real until the actual act of completion . This is a crazy dream world I'm floating in . 
I may just die of mortification . > < I hate job hunting . 
Thank you God , for intervening in the life of my laptop . It's good to see you again , Internet . <3 
Postmodernism and modernism , learning that you exist blows my mind . It was like all this time I wanted a sandwhich but didn't know what it was called . So I wandered around trying to describe what I wanted until , finally , some kind soul said , \That's a sandwhich deary . \ " NOW ALL I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS SANDWHICHES !!!!!! " 
I'm exhausted .... < PROPFEMALE > and I have been having a blast but I haven't done this much running around in a looooooonnnngg time . 
I think my eyeballs may fall out . That or I'm going to pass out and die . Whichever . Either way , this is goodbye , cold , cruel , world . I loved you . 
Hey guys .... Question time ! Guess who still doesn't have a dress ? \ 
Hint : It rhymes with Schmerishka . 
Dress tragedy averted . : ) Had a wonderful night pretending to be a < PROPFEMALE > , eating yummy steak ( that was perfectly cooked Ashley-Rose Dickey ) and laughing with/at the boys for their complete lack of effort in anything remotely royal . <3<3<3 
You know what I hate ? Finally feeling tired and then looking over at clock and seeing it's almost six ; time to wake up . You know what I love ? Dr. McNinja . Google it cause your life doesn't have enough awesome . 
You silly < PROPMALE > Paulahniuk . How did your < PROPMALE > icle about commiting suicide make it into \Men's Fitness\ " ? Why did it have such terrible < PROPMALE >?" 
< PROPMALE > Fowler , < PROPFIRST > Attack Beatty , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Koehnke , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Milograno , tomorrow is the picnic and we are going to do something epic . I'm not sure what yet . But it will be epic . Any ideas ? 
34 comments on my last staus update . That makes me smile . : ) 
If our touch might be so sacred , as grooves and whorls catch and collide ( leaving the faintest traces of infinite individuality mixed ) , \ 
who knows what may come of our maelstrom ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Schuenemeyer is the bestest ! <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3 \ 
Happy Birthday , darling . : ) 
OH NO GUYS ! Don't tell the facebook police , but I'm officially a creeper . It was an accident I swear ! I was just so curious ! DON'T TAKE ME AWAY ! 
Fun Fact : Food is awesome . Apparently , if you eat it often enough you don't have stomach pains , light-headedness or shaking hands anymore ! 
I am so tired of studying for this test it's not even funny . But if I don't study I'll fail it and then I'll have to study MORE . Why can't they just ask me the abc's and my multiplication tables for my diploma ? That's all I'm really gonna use , right ? Right ? 
People constantly confuzzle me . Why can't we seem to be friends despite the fact it seems it should be ? Why did she treat you like that ? Why would he even notice me at all ? \ 
Maybe the key to this is not being philosophical at 4 in the morning . :) 
You know it's going to be a long day when you can't find your pants . > < 
Celebratory cobbler tastes sooooo much better then concilatory cobbler . 
So my head hurts from eating too much sugar , I'm still smiling from kissing bubbles , and my legs hurt from all the spontaneous dancing/running/giddy-jumping I did . \ 
Guess what Ashley-Rose Dickey , < PROPFIRST > Clermont , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Milograno , < PROPFEMALE > Schuenemeyer , @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ruggles , @ < PROPFIRST > Kline , and @ < PROPFEMALE > Chick ? WE'RE GRADUATES ! 
\Complications arise from something I thought was incredibly simple . Aren't we done playing this game ? [ because it's starting to be too much] \"" 
Putting on chapstick after all day without any at a < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > rollarcoaster adventure is one of the best feelings in the world . Right after that giggly , I'm-still-not-touching-the-ground feeling after riding rollarcoasters . : ) 
Funnelcake hangover . SOOOO worth it . 
Pardon the profile pic . It had to be done . HAD TO . 
The beach sounds like just the right thing right now . Too bad that's not actually possible . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , thank you , thank you , for showing me zombie novels . I'm officially hooked . World War Z is freaking fantastic . <3 
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! LEAP YEAR WAS SO CUTE ! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! Anyone who knows a gruff , ruggedly handsome irishman , please point me in his direction . <3<3<3 
Be careful what you wish for , cause you just might get it . 
Purty clothes are now , actually , a part of my wardrobe . The best part is that they did not get stolen , burst into flames , or blow away in the wind before I got them home . <3<3<3<3 Now , let's all get together so I have somewhere to wear them . 
NARGH ! My legs hurt ! Tell me again why I started running ? 
AUGH ! My first plans got cancelled , but my spur of the moment , second plans turned out to be even better ! I saw a hilarious french movie ( Micmacs , GO SEE IT ) saw my first show ( Forever Perfect , I love you and you now have a very special place in my heart ! ) and met awesome people I can't wait to see again . XD 
Happy Father's Day ! <3<3<3<3<3 
Bwaugh ! My brain hurts .... > < \ 
Now , on to watch small children . 
Tiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddd . ._.

I'm back . Got magical tanning abilities , learned a lot about good ( and bad ) leadership , and learned some hard truths about myself . Making subtle movements to happiness . Ask me about it , I'd love to talk . :) 
I want to be a ranicorn when I grow up . <3 
Sam : \This is a < PROPFEMALE > mushroom hat . \ " Me : \ " Actually 
Today is going to be a good day . : ) < PROPFEMALE > Beyerwas born today , I'm going to get to watch movies with friends and have lunch with someone I haven't seen in a long time . A good day . : ) 
Social situations are an adventure . I encourage you to go out and brave the trecherous waters , fighting the sea monsters of emotion and avoiding the sharp rocks of unwritten rules . \ 
\ 
Sometimes it's worth it . And that is often enough for me . 
Yay for awry plans ! I got to play tag in an empty parking lot , < PROPMALE > bubbles , buy clothes , climb ( LOTS AND LOTS OF ) stairs twice , teach people the haha game , play hide and seek in tall bushes and be coersed by the mall water fountains into buying a soda . Who wants to go to New York ? <3 <3 <3 :3 
-.- ugh . -.-

I'll be gone Monday , Tuesday and maybe some of Wednesday , so don't try and reach me cause I'll be on a ROAD TRIP ! <3<3<3<3<3<3<3 
I'm back . <3<3<3<3<3<3<3 Offcially in a better place and very very very happy . Adventures are the best . :3 
And with these tears you loose the last of my restraints . Cover your eyes ! She said run but I'm not running , no I'm not running . Let ' em come , let ' em come , but I'm not running . No , I ain't running no more . 
Poo . Poo on life and all it's intricacies and crazy people and words that have to be spelled right and cohesive thought . Every day should be vacation . Also , Irony feel free to go pester someone else for a while . \ 
In other news : I love you guys . I can't wait to see ya'll . Hugs ? 
' s stream of conciousness : I want to dye my hair magenta . My friends are incredibly intelligent and creative ; I envy them . ^_^ Does being bipolar-esque make me a bad person ? I could listen to this song over and over again . It sounds funny when I type . heh . I think I like him too much . Oh , I need to look at college loans . > < I love running in the rain almost more then anything . Wow , this is getting long ...

The last bite of a grilled cheese . The last bite of delicious , heavenly , deliriously scrumptous , slowly-killing-me , food that shall pass these lips for ten and some odd days . Fruits and veggies , until it is only juice . Wish me luck . -_-
