< PROPMALE > Griffin knocking the mouth guard out of Ortiz's mouth was the highlight of my week .......

I am sooooo excited ! Space Mountain .... here I come !!! 
I'm back from Disneyland . I rode on \California screaming\ " ( the rollercoaster thing ) 13 times during the trip . 6 times in a row on Wed . but I think my favorite ride is either splash mountain or Indiana Jones . " 
I have texting now on this number : 1 209 580 5830

Likes to speed down the highway with the windows down 
Just had an awesome workout with my brothers , come September we are kicking < PROPMALE > can at the judo tournament ... Now to rest up before judo class tonight at 7:30 
Judo is going really good for me right now , I feel as though I am as focused as I was when I was training in MMA ... except this time I don't have a coach keeping me on a certain path ... it's all self conjured drive and raw passion . 
I lifted weights this morning ... It hurts so good +) 
sleepy ........... ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz 
Watched a really dumb movie that I think was supposed to be funny ... \Big Man Japan\ " I'm not sure why I finished all the way through it . " 
\You need to have some passion . This is not about the money . I didn't do Judo for the Money ... I didn't become an Olympian for the money . This is what differentiates [ Judo ] from the NHL or < PROPMALE > league Baseball ... you do it for the passion . \ " ~ Dr. Rhadi Ferguson " 
What I lack in intelligence , I make up for in not being dumb . 
Sittin in Seattle airport . Just ate a breakfast burrito and now I am just waiting for 11 o'clock to roll around . On a side note ; I don't much like the weather here . 
In Montana :) 
I swam in a pool four times longer than an Olympic pool , I swear .... and after 6 laps I felt dead ... I think I need to get back into shape through swimming . 
The place I intend to attack must not be known ; if it is unknown , the enemy will have to reinforce many places ; the enemy will reinforce many places , but I shall attack few . 
goodbye summer ... tomorrow begins the chaos .

yippeekiyay , sucka ! 
Oh hey , it's Tuesday . I competed on Sunday and came home with third place . nothing to complain about but I'm disappointed I couldn't do better , especially since both of my losses were close calls . I won two matches and lost two . had some good fights and did a little networking/socializing , so it's all good . 
I r dead 
Y'know , it's always interesting to realize how \sport Judo\ " hurts like heck . " 
\The only exercise\ 
It would be a very bad thing if I were the hulk right now ... \can't .... Find ... Keys !? HULK SMASH !!!! \"" 
UFC120\ 
< PROPFIRST > Rogan : \Disappointing loss 
\You don't have to be good to succeed . You just gotta be the least crappy option . Example : We're eating at The < PROPFEMALE > Garden . \"" 
I had a dream Cain Velasquez tapped out < PROPMALE > Lesnar with a triangle choke . I thought it was real until I opened my inbox and so the ad for the fight tonight , so it didn't happen yet . 
Ok , so , I had a dream that Brocky lost , and it came true , except it wasn't by submission . should I have capitalized on my dream ? 
I'm dead tired . except I can't fall asleep . On days like this , when I have three workouts , I feel so achy . But I feel like my injuries from a few weeks ago are letting me train hard again . I was doing uchikomis as fast as I could today and it felt crazier than sprints . feels good to be sore . 
Happy first day of the Christmas season , everybody !! +D 
I need another class to give me 12 units next semester ... any suggestions ? I have EMS/CPR , Fire Protection , and Cont . Film . 
Training < PROPFIRST > this morning ! He only threw up once this time . He's making progress ! 
Woke up late ! Missed all of my\ 
Morning workouts . Not happy about that . Gonna go run to the school and punish myself on the bleachers . 
Ok , ended up getting called in to work , so I'm chucking rocks instead of running 
came home from working , went and worked out , now I'm going to Judo ... still have some energy left +D btw , I never touch energy drinks . 
Went to the sac zoo , and went to see Megamind . It was good . If you like comic books or like super heroes , you'll like Megamind .
