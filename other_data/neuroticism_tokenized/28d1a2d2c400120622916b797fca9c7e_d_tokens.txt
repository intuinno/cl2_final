One more day here . Got exactly nothing I was aiming for accomplished . Seems like a successful holiday . 

Seriously disturbing thought just popped into my head ... imaginary parents ... \ 
( This one's gonna send < PROPMALE > to an asylum ) 
When I get done with this homework it's time for a quick invasion or two ... 
FINALLY ... Next .. sleep ... 
Thank God that week's over ... now for the next one ... <_< 
Cold , clear malevolence ... welcome to the Rain ... 
It will be forgotten soon enough ... maybe then everything will be right in your life , huh ? 
CAnnot believe the load of work he got for Spring Break ... just great ... -_- 
This weekend's gonna be a nightmare and a half on my nerves , but I'm pretty sure I can handle it ... just need the right supplies now ... 
I'll be heading to church forthe first time in a long time ... let's see if this will impove my mood any ... 
Will be ruining your appitites to get your lunch from now on ... You've been warned :D 
Has an idea for a Class Prank ... but I'm gonna need full participation fro everyone that's graduating . Let's see how this plays out 
Don't ask me how .. but I have a job now ... O_o 
That's it , I'm gettin ' a GPS system -_- 
Anyone that knows where I can get a bike , let me know ... I really need one -_- 
In search of employment ... anyone that can accomodate , please , don't hesitate to let me know :D 
Any particular reason for ... know what , nevermind ... O_o 
Happy Birthday Mama :D 
It's always around midnight for some reason ... 
Don't say you're not afraid of the dark and then panic when I approach ... 
Time for a new experiment ... now to find one ... 
Needs to skate soon or will surely lose his mind ... 
Progress on song :\ 
Lyrics : No concpet\ 
Music : Concept complete , need equipment to make it\ 
Collaborators : J-Rod set to co-record , Devontae on engineering\ 
Overall : A disaster waiting to happen ... 
Lyrics : Concept in development\ 
Music : Concept in revision , still need equipment to make it\ 
Overall : Status - Unstable 
If your world's on fire , don't fight it , just let it burn . It will just grow rightback even better than before . 
A lot of what I find out is because of sheep curiosity ... it shall be the death of me someday to become curious of something radioactive ... 
L-3 : Love , Loyalty , and Longevity ... the basics of life ... 
Into the streets peoples , lets go . 
Love is , quite simply , nothing more than friendship set on fire ... 
Randomly occurring idea bound to cause either untold hilarity , or unimaginable failure ... either way , my curiosity won't let me leave it alone ... 
And now to test the limitations of my program alteration abilities ... Firefox , prepare to be mutilat-ified >:D 
If not for simply not having the attention span to be annoyed forlong , living without a phone would have sent me into an anger management class by now ... Not often I use the thing but it comes in handy when I need to contact people ... -_- 
Note to self ... Haircut ... ASAP ... 
And now to figure out how to market my new business ... 
No idea where it came from , but I just wrote some random verse in my lyric book and it actually makes sense ... apperantly subconsious me has something to say ... 
Okay , I can't help but wonder , since we had a Swine Flu problem in the Chinese year of the pig , and a Mad Cow outbreak during the year of the Ox ... am I the only one worried about what kind of disaster will befall mankind in the year of the Cock ? 
The invasion begins tomorrow ... where's a battleaxe when you need one ? 
Has the odd urge to start making fansigns of random people on my profile ... you have been warned ... <_< 
That's it , I'm gonna have to start raiding unemployment offices in a minute ... 
And thus I am employed :D 
Thoughts are filling my head demanding to be released ... I shall start posting them as rants . Read if you're interested , and don't if you're not . :D 
Why is it that when someone tells you there are billions of stars in the universe you believe it , but if someone says there is wet paint you have to touch it ? 
Needs to take more pics of stuff he wants to remember because he lacks both the attention span and memory not to ... 
Things to do :\ 
-\chipping\ " \ 
HazMat teams are set , now we need some people to document this . Anyone wanna point some cameras ? 
Data collection commences . Movement patterns and habits in observation . 
Southward to Prichard ... to Home ... :) 
Never before have I been so happy to be home ... :) 
Bored already ... gotta find something interesting to do ... 
Talent show next semester with a grand as the prize . Need help on a song concept ... 
What did they call Old Spice when it first came out ? 
Why do they call it Alcoholics Anonymous when the first thing they make you do is introduce yourself ? 
Yeah ... HTF did I get paid today yet I'm still flat broke ? 
I'm honestly looking forward to going back to school Monday ... odd ... 
Northward to Birmingham ! So much crap to catch up on ... 
Has found a simulator that will allow me to unleash zombie Hell on A little city and enjoy the carnage as it unfolds ... 
Just when I'm able to turn my phone back on , Straight Talk is being a bitch -_- ... Someone remind me to light the Verizon network on fire when I get the < PROPMALE > ... 
Phone's back on ! I'm still gonna light Verizon's network on fire thought -_- ... 
New choice of character ... I am Koga , the wolf ... >:] 
Anyone else wanna send my roommate to Somalia in a cardboard box filled with Bullet Ants and Japanese Giant Wasps ? Like if you do . 
If jesus didn't believe in himself ... would it be blasphemy ? 
4 days ... planning now ... >:] 
Back home ... time to party !!! 
Suddenly wondering whether or not to try to start a student organization of music lovers ... 
Just saw some kid darting down the street with an armload of Pop-Tarts and Faygo ... it's like I'm having 3rd person flashbacks ... o_o 
Please copy and paste this into your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face , except a punch in the face . 93% of people won't repost this . Why ? Because they probably need a punch in the face . 
Music project now under construction . I'll be headed to Saraland to pick up my guitar in a day or two , and my amp , tuner , and everything else will be waiting for me when I get back to the dorm ... Only a matter of time now ... 
And now the work begins . Bass in hand , amp on it's way to UAB , and music relentlessly flowing through my skull . LET'S SET THIS BITCH OFF !!! 
I find it odd I have insomnia only when I plan to go to sleep early ... yet when I need to stay up I'm suddenly narcoleptic ... 
Chances are you could light my whole world on fire and I'd sit there with my mouth shut and my eyes closed simply because it'd upset you otherwise . 
FML x infinity 
Home feels good but I'm starting to miss Birmingham . Only have until Monday to enjoy myself here . That or just sit around and learn how to play this guitar . 
Very seriously considering taking an actual class to learn how to play this Bass . 
It snowed ... it fking snowed ... And that partialy explains why my frozen fingers have taken about 5 minutes to write this status . 
Off to < PROPMALE>'s house today . Got my 360 opened and now I'm gonna Frankenstein his . 
Let's see . \ 
Xbox from cousin : Free\ 
Xbox from Jermaine : $60\ 
Souldering gun : Free assuming I find someone with one\ 
Xbox 360 off eBay : $150+\ 
\ 
All in all , an XBox 360 for 60 bucks plus some elbow grease sounds like a good deal 
Erasa dulsae 
Need to know good sites for buying posters , banners , and other things I can < PROPFEMALE > on my walls . Extra points for sites that let you send in your own designs ! ^_^ 
Kinda finds it funny that anarchists always seem to use the same symbol ... 
For anyone that's playing Red Dead Redemption : Undead Nightmare , be warned . STAY THE HELL OUT OF JORGE'S GAP . IT IS LITERALLY FULL OF ZOMBIES !!! 
Leave it to me to get sick on < PROPFIRST>'s Day and be even sicker after trying to sleep it off ... -_____- 
Snapped a string on my guitar ... replaced all of them ... now can't get the thing to hold a tune to save my life ... -_- Well , guess no practice this weekend ... 
PEOPLE !!! NUDITY IS NOT A STYLE !!! ( unless you're female ... and hot ... ) 
Jas isn't feeling too well ... as much as I never thought I'f be asking other people for prayer ... people , please send out a prayer for her to feel better ... or at least to not be in so much pain ... 
Hoping on the bandwagon ... \ 
I bet you people can't get all of this right :\ 
My middle name/Age/Favorite soda/Who's the love of my life/My best friend/Favorite color/Eye color/Hair color/Favorite food/My mom's name 
< PROPMALE>'s cat reminds me entirely too much of Buckey ... -_- 
Just gotthe Animorphs and Everworld collection in eBook form ... farewell plans for Spring Break , hello nostalgia ^_^ 
Just got back from a rave ... can't feel my legs , brain , arms , or feet ... back hurts , abs are on fire , and I'm pretty sure I was paralyzed at some point . Strangely I'm happier than I've been in a while ... gotta do this more often ... 
Heading home today . Leaving in an hour or two . Anyone that needs to contact me , just call or text . 
Just great ... I'm sent to get food from some place I've never been before , stop to get gas so I don't have to walk there and back , get back on the road , and less than 5 minutes later get hit with tickets I have no clue the cost for ... just fucking great ...
