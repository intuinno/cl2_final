You gotta see The Book of < PROPMALE > its a great movie 

To the Facebook team : Fantastic job ........ Facebook now runs so slow I can catch up on what was happening last week ! I hope that you all enjoyed the new look party on Friday . I only have one request .... When you all sober up can you please fix the mess you have made of the home < PROPFEMALE > . Will all friends please repost ? 
Wifes in the hospital tonite , they think she had a mini stroke , so am feeling scaried and lonely again . Was hoping I wouldn't feel like this after I got married but it doesn't go away , it just changes directions a little . But wouldn't have done it any other way . Sorry fore this but had to get my feelings out some how . Night all . 
My wife came home today . They couldn't find a definite cause for what happened , but they are saying it was a possible < PROPFEMALE > which is a decrease in blood to an area of the brain rather than a total blockage like in a stroke . She is still showing symptoms , but that seems to be getting better . Sometime I wonder why they don't try to find out why it's happinig rather than treating symptoms . 
Never try to baptise a cat . 
Thank You all for the Lovely Birthday Wishes !!! Just sorry I didn't get online yesterday to see them earlier
