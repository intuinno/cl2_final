Happy New Year ! I've got a feeling this is going to be a good year : the first person I spoke to this year was my Demitri ! 

watched some Seinfeld with friends ! I love my awesome friends ! 
is being useless and enjoying every minute of it ! :-D 
is munching nacho doritos with tuna salad ! Yummy ! :-D 
is watching House with < PROPFIRST > and studying Kant ... >_< ( hates Philosophy ) 
' s facbook has been infiltrated by < PROPFIRST > . That is all . 
is wanting company ... 
is indulging in awesome milk duds ! 
has returned from her adventure underneath her bed ... had to rescue mp3 player from the monsters 
is amused to hear a wolf-whistle first thing in the morning ! 
is feeling lonely and wants someone fun to chill with ... any takers ? 
is ready for the weekend ! I'm looking forward to seeing my parents ... ( and hoping my daddy still has that old banjo ) 
is back at school and is now hanging with < PROPFIRST > ! 
Oh goodness ! It squeaks !!! 
is seven kinds of lonely ... I need some kind of little friend that's pocket-sized so I can < PROPFEMALE > it around and always have someone to talk to ... ( hopefully someone who'd want to talk to me as well ) 
is falling off the high point ( it only took 28 hrs ) .... 
was sleeping peacefully in History until the crazy Australian started raving about small children tunneling through mines down to naked men ... 
When life fills your pants with holes make sure you're wearing pretty undergarments ! 
When given the choice between me or someone else I'm usually picked last ... it's alright , though , because there needs to be that distinguishment between popular and unpopular , liked and unliked , winner and loser . Without the loser , there's no basis fo comparison for the winner . Someone has to be the last one chosen and now I've realized I'm ok with it being me ... at least I'm picked at all , right ? 
is being amused by < PROPFIRST > ... 
is jealous that < PROPFIRST > is abandoning me for sexy magician guy on Friday ... 
just got peanut butter rubbed in her face by < PROPFIRST > ! Oh my goodness , < PROPFIRST > ! First banana , now peanut butter ! What next ? 
Sometimes .... you just have to let go 
was amused by < PROPFIRST>'s balloon animals . :-) 
Why doesn't life come with a \d o-o ver\ " button ? " 
is wondering if perhaps the tragedy at Fort Hood had something to do with it being the 5th of November ... curious coincidence otherwise . 
delt a low blow to a creeper cadet . Serves him right , though . He insulted < PROPFIRST > Bowie for wearing tights in the Labyrinth . Only real men wear tights ... obviously the creeper cadet was not a real man ! 
has been introduced to what college is really about : trying to find out your own personal beliefs and figuring out what kind of person you really are . So far , I think I'll get by with a little help from my friends ... if they're willing . 
won a bet against her Philosophy professor ! 
Well .... THAT was a complete disaster ! If humans are necessarily social , why doesn't that mean we all get along smoothly without me making a complete idiot of myself ? It seems the harder I try the more epically I fail . Maybe I should just stop trying ... 
Sometimes there simply aren't enough words to describe the emotions we feel ... 
is feeling incredibly lonely today ... everyone's either busy or doesn't want my kind of company . Doesn't anybody need a friend today ? 
has to go to evil math class ... :-( 
is home for the weekend ! 
is missing her favorite peanut butter cookie recipe ... :-( 
Screws fall out all the time ; the world is an imperfect place . 
is fighting off rainclouds by watching Pixar movies with < PROPFIRST > . 
wow .... just , wow ! 
Today was amazing ! And despite Philosophy and a Leadership Final at 8am , tomorrow is going to be even better ! 
is waiting on < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Had crazy fun hanging out with < PROPFIRST > and new ( and oh-so adorable ) friend < PROPFIRST > ! More fun times to come I hope ? 
' s dorm room smells like Christmas ! 
has just been won over by grape soda ! Thank you , Demitri ! <3 
is hanging out with Demitri before Thanksgiving holidays ! 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! 
has got such a headache ... and still four pages to go on an English essay ( all in vain because I already know it's going to merit an 85 ) . At least tomorrow will be better ... I get to see Demitri !!! 
might as well be floating on a cloud ... b/c that's definately where my mind will be tomorrow !!! 
is watching life close in around me ... If only there was a way to freeze time , just for a little while . 
has ordered pizza to curb midnight muchies brought about by the late-night study sessions . 
is happy about her grades from first semester of college !!! Nothing lower than a B ! 
MMM ... cookies and Classic Rock music ! I love the holiday season ! 
is spending time with Demitri <3 !!! 
It's a Festivus miracle ! 
Another Festivus miracle ! 
is watching Big Fish for the first time . Such a beautiful story ... I think I needs cuddles . 
is terribly confused . I need a pocket-sized advisor that would travel with me at all times and advise me before making < PROPMALE > decisions . 
hates the way some people simply regard the feelings of others as absolutely meaningless . 
and sometimes you feel like a nowhereman ... 
has just gotten the greatest Christmas gifts from two of her dearest friends . Thanks < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > ! I love you guys ! 
Got two hours of sleep . Family didn't like the gifts I got them . Sister insulted the food . Mom ran off to work upset . And now I get to go clean up the kitchen . Yeah , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to me .... Hope everyone else had a good one . 
can't wait until Tuesday ! 
is rocking out with her awesome new mp3 player ! It's amazing the immense joy such a small devise can bring . 
is amazed just how much people can change , even in a short time frame . So then , can you ever really know someone ? Maybe it's just a really good act they perform for your amusement . 
It's snowing in Habersham County !!! 
is making a hat for < PROPMALE > ( my sock monkey ) . 
So far Mr. Punch is my only New Year's companion . And people wonder why I'm socially awkward ... 
This tastes terrible . Why can't I stop eating it ? 
Why does OkCupid think it knows my type ? I'm not even sure I know my type . 
Is finally getting rid of old clothes and things . Either I'm late or early for Spring cleaning . 
is back at school and got her replacement ID card . Now I can eat and get back into the building ... but most importantly , I can eat ! 
Snowday ! 
is freaking out ! $425 . 88 for textbooks , printer out of paper , and stupid English class in one hour ! 
Half of English and all of French homework down , History and Accounting homework to go ..... 
One more hour til my first day of Economics . Who's excited ? 
is finally finished with tonight's homework ! English homework : nearly two and a half hours to finish . Accounting homework : less than 5 minutes ! 
is sitting in Accounting 101 . This is the first class I've had that is actually a review from high school . The class is still discussing the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable . How many more hour-and-a-half long lectures must I endure of this ? 
is no longer a hopeless romantic ... That doesn't mean I'm a hopeful one . I just think I finally understand this \love\ " concept enough to know it works nothing like the movies . Thank you Hollywood for corrupting yet another aspect of my young life . " 
was debating whether or not to return to school Sunday or just wait until Monday . I've now decided to stay home the extra day . At least at home I can't make anyone mad .... I hope . Besides , no one at school will notice anyway . 
Love's gonna get you down . 
And when I hurt , hurting runs off my shoulder . How can I hurt when I'm with you ? 
has a big cookie ! ( Don't worry , < PROPFIRST > . I got you one too ! ) 
is in Economics and discussing my favorite topic -- MONEY !!! 
\You said that it would Now everything should Be alright ... \"" 
is now addicted to Starbuck's iced caramel mochiatto 
Actually had fun studying French today ! 
is so sick of just being a temporary time filler for people . From now on , I only want to spend time with people who honestly want to spend time with me . 
Alright , world ! You have exactly 50 minutes left ! This day has been hell already so hit me with whatever you have left ! I don't think things can get much worse at this point .... but you're welcome to try ! 
doesn't want to go to work ! =( 
It's interesting to work in fast food on weekends . The same people who tell you \Jesus loves you\ " and \ " be blessed\ " on Sundays are the people screaming at you Saturday and telling you just where to stick those fries . " 
Oh Caffeine , sweet exlixir of life , lend me your strength to get me through this night ! 
J'etudie l'economie . :P 
I swear if these stupid blondes in front of me ask once more if accounts payable is an asset account I'm going to kick them in the back of their bleach-blonde heads . 
Ten more minutes in Econ ., then I get to brave the weather home on 52's curves ... oh joy . 
30 more minutes in Accounting . I really was expecting a much more difficult quiz ... all we had to do was list the account type and normal balance . 
Accounting + Dragging along friends to class .... * cough .... Introducing friends to career path = Fun ! :D 
When he leans over and whispers in my ear , the words whispered are not what I was expecting and I am sad to learn that I am still a hopeless romantic .... 
Happy National Single's Awareness Day ! 
is not seeing anything about school closings ... does this mean I still have to go to class ? 
Help . I need somebody . Help . Not just anybody . Help . You know I need somebody . HELP !!! 
wants to see magic ... Kyle will perform ? :) 
Why do I always fall in love with the ones who don't love me ? 
I've now dated a loser and a jerk . Third time's the charm , right ? 
And as I sat there I realized that even after all the pain he caused me I still love him ... 
When does Accounting stop being a review from high school ? First test grade : 94 ! 
Why do the ones we love the most change into different people ? 
is resting at home ... 
No longer has to work on weekends . Maybe I should start hanging more with old friends from high school . Anyone interested ? 
For all sad words of tongue and pen , the saddest are those \it might have been . \"" 
I have finally come to the conclusion that the idea of \soul mates\ " is an entirely fictitious concept . " 
Today's Economics Assignment : Listen to The Clash ! 
Wow ! Shot down cold ! Am I really THAT unattractive ? 
\Thank you for curing me of my rediculous obsession with love . \"" 
Open Mic Night tomorrow . Finally , some fun way to kill time !

Pineapples ? 
had a fabulous time with my boys ! I love you < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > ! <3 
Only 500 more words to go until the completion of nasty English research essay . Still to come : 7-page History research essay , 5-page French essay , and massive Poetry project . At least I still have time on everything else . Is it time for finals yet , please ? 
Everything's against me tonight , I swear it ! 
is up before noon on a Saturday ... today's not going to be a good day . 
I think someone upstairs is mad at me ... 
Watched the best version of < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ever ! The setting was Ireland . The rival families were faeries vs leprechauns and they beat each other with sheleighly sticks . The music was fantastic , too ! =D 
~ Monday , bloody Monday ~ 
Creature comfort goals They only numb my soul and make it hard for me to see My thoughts all seem to stray , to places far away I need a change of scenery 
Today in English : \Any questions ? \ " -\" Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? \ " \ " WHAT ? \ " -\" Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? \ " \ " I'm afraid I don't understand ... \ " -\" We're all mad here ! \"" 
I don't suffer from insomnia , I enjoy every minute of it ! 
got a strawberry plant ! I really hope I don't kill it . 
is excited ! 
is super excited ! I <3 my brother ! 
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed When the ocean met the sky You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye 
oh the insomnia ! I curse you ! 
Sooo much to do and even less time to do it in . 
' s car got hit while PARKED in the Ingles parking lot . I swear , could my luck be any worse ? =( 
just finished watching The Time Traveler's Wife and is about to start an essay ..... I think I'm going to cry about both . 
found < PROPMALE > ! He gave me a hug and cherry-scented bubbles ! =D 
OMG ! A < PROPFEMALE > male that's actually attractive ? I'm excited ! 
' s car is going to be repaired ! I dropped it off today and , with luck , get it back next Friday ! 
loves creeping on other people's facebook pages . 
Nothing like a Pixar movie to make all your troubles disappear <3 
bought a case of HUGS !!! It's the simple things that amuse me most . 
It's depressing how quickly people change . It's almost as if you meet the people you've known forever for the very first time . 
\The Glass Menagerie \"---- saddest thing I've read in awhile . " 
Three more days of classes until finals . Should I be excited or scared ?

One more final and then party time ! 
Ding , < PROPFIRST > ! The witch is gone ! Checked out at 8 ; ain't it great ! =D Finally , the drama < PROPFEMALE > has left . Peace and quiet at last . 
is finally awake after nearly two full days of sleeping . 
Food time then back to sleep ... 
has been watching too many romance movies . In most movies , there is a hero/heroine character that finds true love and everything works out for them in the end , but what happens to the others ? The characters that don't find true love ? Are they just there solely for a basis of comparison for the happiness of the hero/heroine ? If so , that's really not fair . 
Brownies are done ! Now off to daddy's for steak dinner ! =D 
Everything's in order in a black hole Nothing seems as pretty as the past though That Bloody < PROPFIRST>'s lacking in tabasco Remember when you used to be a rascal ? Oh that boy's a slag The best you ever had The best you ever had is just a memory ... 
is getting new glasses ! They're simply darling ! I got dark purple frames with zebra stripes down the sides . Now I'll have green , blue , and purple frames ! 
' s new glasses are here !!! I'm picking them up later today ! So excited !!! =D 
If it's not MY fault and I can't do anything to change it I don't see why I should be the one getting yelled at . :/ 
is in a very fragile state right now . Curse you , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > ! 
\Believe it or not I'm not at home . Please leave a message at the beep . I must be out or I'd pick up the phone . Where could I be ? Believe it or not I'm not home . \ " -<PROPFIRST>'s answering machine ( Seinfeld ) " 
Summer school begins tomorrow .... yay , Marketing ?! :/ 
got insulted by her marketing professor for being a redhead . Today was a great day ! =D 
is so incredibly bored . 
went shopping ! Once again , I scored some amazing sales . 
down , down , down it goes ... where it ends no one knows ..... hahahahahahaha 
Life really should come with a how-to guide and an \undo\ " button . Cheat codes and a magical assistant would be much appreciated also . " 
What if it really was the end of the world as we knew it ? I think my time has already past . 
has just proven that , even with Facebook , it is possible to disappear for days without anyone noticing . 
Sometimes there trully are some pretty awesome Laugh Out Loud moments ! OMG ! 
is possibly going sailing Sunday . Anyone want to come with ? 
well sailing's out . =( Anyone not busy today ? 
Oh memories ! How you plague me ! Dearest one , how you torment my very soul ! I want nothing more than to be able to hate you and yet .... even these many months past ... I fear my love for you still haunts me .

\It puts the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again ... \"" 
will be so excited when this lame Twilight fad is over . Even my Accounting teacher will be attending the midnight viewing ... unfortunately , this still wasn't enough to make him delay our test . =( 
cried at yet another Pixar movie ! This is just sad ... but my childhood officially ended with Toy Story 3 . :'( 
<3 This one's for you : <3 \ 
And you can tell everybody this is your song\ 
It may be quite simple but , now that it's done\ 
I hope you don't mind , I hope you don't mind\

Last day of Summer classes !!! 
Last night felt like an Arby's night . I had the roast beef .... 
When in doubt , bribe the professor with mangos . It got me an A ! 
is spending time with her favorite person ! My brother < PROPFIRST > Jarrard 
is watching < PROPFIRST > Pratchett's The Colour of Magic . It's surprisingly good . 
I am not worthy of Wednesdays ... but my sister shall grace me with her presence Friday morning . =P 
will be watching Pride and Prejudice tonight . <3 
hates annoying passengers . I'm this ........................................... close to the car in front of me . Yes , I see the car stopping . THERE'S NO NEED TO SHOUT . 
A comic book just made me cry ! I feel ridiculous .... 
is finally back from vacation ! It's great to get away , but always pleasant to return home . The internet is finally working again ( even though it's really slow ) and I'm no longer on the road in the middle of storms . 
I went on the Ripley's Ghost Tour . Included with the price of a ticket is a cheap camera with a really bright flash to allow tourists to capture the ghosts on film . On the tour , we visited a graveyard , drug store , Spanish hospital , and a haunted house . Never failed ! At every location , the other tourists were contantly taking my picture ( the flash directly in my face ! ) . I know I'm pale , but I'm not THAT pale !!! 
\Ever been in love ? Horrible 
wants cheesecake ... and a hug . 
Is hanging out with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Forgot to log out of facebook on < PROPFIRST>'s phone ..... mwahahaha 
was so excited to see < PROPFEMALE > Michels and < PROPFEMALE > Nguyen in World Literature ! If I have to suffer through this class , at least we're all in it together . =) 
Tomorrow will prove to be one of the happiest and one of the most depressing days of my life . On the upside , I have the opportunity to spend time with dear friends . On the downside , I have to wave goodbye to perfectly good money to buy my textbooks . 
This semester's textbooks have left a $300 hole in my wallet . =( At least I'll have one class with my favorite brother , < PROPFIRST > Jarrard ! 
Tomorrow's schedule : THEATER ! 
is hoping the gods of dreams smile upon her tonight . 
Has any other Seinfeld fan ever noticed the odd things in Newman's apartment ? There's an inflatable ice cream cone and The < PROPFEMALE > Bride VHS among his odd collections ! 
curses Quia and French ! 
needs a hug ... 
wonders what it would be like to be a nomad . Just travel around and live out of a car or something . Might not be so bad ... 
I believe I'll change my reality so that it differs from others . 
Such a dream as I had last night ... shame I had to wake up . 
Forever's gonna start tonight . 
\Though nothing will keep us together\ 
Tomorrow : French test + Lit . test = :'( \ 
Hopefully evening activities with friends will make it all better .

\I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies . \ " ~ American Gods "

would like just a few more hours of sleep . 
got Men Who Stare At Goats this weekend ! And new Sandman comics ! 
needs more Sandman comics . I've already finished the two I bought last weekend . 
One year later and it still hurts . I forget so many important things ... why can't I forget this , too ? 
\It's just a jump to the left . Then a step to the ri-ri-ri-i-i-ight . Put your hands on your hips ... and bring your knees in ti-i-ight . Now it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insa-a-a-ane . Let's do the TIME WARP again !!! \"" 
I never knew what horrible things a simple apology could lead to . Thanks to a lesson on ' forgiveness , ' I contacted someone to apologize and forgive ... now I am believed to be a stalker . Um ... thanks , God ? 
We are but mere pawns in the overall game of life . 
Changed my profile picture for Halloween . Enjoy , < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show Fans ! ( Read the fine print , Twilight geeks )

The Google logo is Pirate-themed today !!! =)

is awake ... and at 10:30 ... what's wrong with me ? 
\Stories that matter have ends . Anything that matters ends . It's the end that gives it a meaning . \ " ~ < PROPMALE > Gaiman " 
Insomnia ... You drive me near the brink of insanity . Why does the Sandman hate me ? 
So ... last night was an Arby's night . I had coupons . 
has briefly got her computer working ... maybe . Guess I'll have to buy a new one . 
finally has the < PROPMALE > to read ! In twelve days , I've finished three novels on my holiday reading list ! 
I want a seriously awesome gaming computer with an amazing graphics card and memory capacity . Also , it needs to be fast and reasonably priced . Any suggestions from computer/tech-inclined friends ? 
Best benefit of being single around the holiday season : I've saved approximately $300 !!! 
Finally ! I found the last Sandman I was missing !

doesn't want the school break to end . 
Now has Toy Story 3 ! 
Finally ! Mr. Punch has arrived ! 
Watching Labyrinth documentary while my cake cools . Baking is a love/hate relationship , I'm certain . 
First class of Spring 2011 semester ... hopefully some cute , single boys will be in here . 
First day back wasn't too terrible . At least I got to see a few of my friends . Friday is going to be awesome , though ! 
Finance , then lunch w/ friends , three more classes , and church tonight . I can't wait for this busy day to end . I miss my winter sleep schedule . 
Sometimes I wonder what my parents would do if I were truly a bad kid . Yes , I'm home late ... but what if I was out scoring drugs instead of attending church ? Would they're reaction be worse or still the same ? 
No , Wind , you may not blow my house down ! It's the only one I've got so I'd appreciate you leaving it be . 
I awake to find my house still standing . Take that , Wind ! 
Laptop mission accomplished . Now to attack this mountain of homework . 
Is ready for tomorrow , but still not quite ready for Tuesday . 
Just got a case of the warm fuzzies from watching Sixteen Candles . I thought I had these hopeless romantic feelings repressed . 
is starting to get cabin fever on top of these re-surfacing hopeless romantic thoughts . I'm really beginning to hate this weather . It's depressing , lonely , and cold . 
I can't take this much longer . I'm getting a serious case of cabin fever . Trapped by six inches of snow ... and I'm starting to imagine things . It's like a return of the spiders . I'm beginning to fear for my sanity ... house keeps shrinking .... can't sleep at night ... Please , God , no more poetry ! 
Every time I see his face , I can't help smiling . His sense of humour is charming . And oh , to hear him sing \Haben Sein < PROPFEMALE > Heard < PROPFEMALE > Deutschland Band ! \ " I <3 Will Ferrell ! " 
Looks like I'm going to be stuck at home again tomorrow . Parents won't let me go to school or church . =( I absolutely cannot stand this anymore !!! Seriously , our driveway is frozen and there is no escape . I am freaking out !!! 
After hearing I'll be living with her until I graduate ~ \ 
Mom : I'm just not sure we're compatible roommates . \ 
Me : Sorry , but I don't think anyone else could handle living with me either . So I guess you're stuck . \ 
( I'm sure she was joking , but I'm not . Think b/f you have children b/c they may be w/ you longer than you expect . ) 
According to my 2011 Horoscope , this is my year to find love . Hahaha ! I really wish this were true . Anyone else get \finding love\ " in their horoscope ? Who got \ " this year will be fortunate ? \ " I want to be your friend . \ 
I survived my driveway , which was a sheet of glass .... both down the hill and up . Made it to Dahlonega and checked out an apartment . I now , officially , live in Dahlonega ... less than two < PROPMALE > from church and school !

Had lunch with four adorable gentlemen and Sociology class just got canceled ! This could very well just be the best day I've had in awhile . 
Has just posted the Civil War Story . If you were among the tagged , enjoy the laugh . It is , in NO WAY , an account of historical accuracy but rather a work of fantasy , boredom , and a touch of insanity created by myself and < PROPFEMALE > Piggott . 
has completed her homework for the weekend . Now off to North < PROPFEMALE > for a weekend of sushi and contemporary worship service . 
Be it ever so humble , there's no place like home ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Piggott is wasting time on FACEBOOK !!! I know . I'm sitting next to her . 
According to < PROPFEMALE > Piggott , I suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder .... eight points above average .... 
What began as a peaceful evening turned into a rescue mission to save a stranded friend from a shady gas station . No worries . We still love you , < PROPFEMALE > Bowden ! <3 
\I took shelter from a shower\ 
loving the Snoopy reference in tonight's Family Guy ! 
Who's the lady on the Zaxby commercials ?

Ladies , why is it we always have crushes on the guys who never notice us ?
