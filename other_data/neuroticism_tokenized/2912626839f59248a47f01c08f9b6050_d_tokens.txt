If you knew the ways in which i hate myself .. i wonder .. would you start\ 
to hate me too ? .. if you knew me like I knew me .. would you wish\ 
to never have known me , like I find myself doing ? \ 
\ 
i found this and liked it 
People are always telling me to\ 
smile , like smiling is going to just take away all the hurt and pain . Well I've\ 
tried that I've tried hiding my sorrows and covering the sadness in smiles and\ 
what I've learned is that when it hurts this much inside your heart always has\ 
a way of showing it no matter how many masks you wear
