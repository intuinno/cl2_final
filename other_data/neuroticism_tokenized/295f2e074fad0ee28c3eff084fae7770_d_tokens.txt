SNOW DAY - probably best day of school so far . :D Can't wait till tomorrow ! 
NOOO ! Why is school cancelled ? Or , rephrase : Why did I leave my violin at school when there is Solo and Ensemble next week and I know the school would possibly close down and most likely be locked ??? 
burned her hand while cooking pancakes Indian-style - OUCH ! 
????????? ????? Hello everybody , happy new year ! Gong xi fa cai ! 
Got a 1 on Solo despite screwing up timing - ugh , I can't wait till Ruddy or Akshay texts me back with Quartet results ( in which I screwed up the beginning) ! 
OMG T.T Why is it that everywhere I look , I seem to be in somebody's profile picture ?! And not even a good picture too - it's always an extremely hideous one ... WAH ! 
OMG I HATE LIFE : bad news , Jiffy and Miko , my mom decided to NOT let me go to the mall because she and Dad are going out and she wants to make me make HIM study for SAT ! GRR so unfair ! 
BLEH annotations 
regrets leaving her project and homework assignments downstairs because now there's a bunch of strangers in the living room and she feels too awkward to walk past them . 
I cannot draw maps . :( 
ASDFJKL ; BLAH whatever . -_- 
Mall was fun today ! Too bad I am now grounded for two weeks for being an hour over my curfew . 
asdfjkl ; TAKS tomorrow . I hate . 
cannot settle on a profile picture . Probably because Ania's put up too many good pics !

I hate mysteries ! 
went to some Superintendent Scholar's Award Ceremony to pick up award ... the best part of it was the free pen they gave out ! 
My dad fell asleep at the Orchestra meeting today . I think he was the only parent to do so . :) 
My eyes are finally not retarded ! *_* I hope this lasts for a good while .

GRR poking war with Ania Miko , < PROPMALE > Flores , and Ruddy < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
Went to the mall with Ania Miko and ended up smelling like ten different things . -_- 
BWAHAHA < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>'s text : \Happy failed abortion ! What do u want today ? \"" 
I don't understand why 86% of Americans supposedly object to the mosque being built on Ground Zero ! If that's true , this country is seriously going down ...

Ania Miko ? ajczak is amazing in that when she writes something , I can practically hear her voice coming out of the screen . \
