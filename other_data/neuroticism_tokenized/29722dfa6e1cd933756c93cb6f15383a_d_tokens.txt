just had to write an Italian composition about getting ready to leave Italy ... and is now feeling rather morose about the the whole concept . 
my computer charger decided the day before two < PROPMALE > papers are due was the PERFECT time to get fried . On the up side , it's making me feel a whole lot less sentimental about leaving Italy ... 
is in a Gin Blossoms/ Matchbox 20 kinda mood .... I guess that's what the combination of finally finishing my < PROPMALE > projects for my classes , imminent departure from Italy , and the beauty of springtime in < PROPFEMALE > will do to you ....

Dear Rockbridge County :\ 
I realize that this is < PROPFEMALE > , and being significantly south of the Mason-Dixon line , you have no clue what to do with that white fluffy stuff that falls out of the sky . However , since the Snowpocalypse did occur last year , I was hoping you'd gotten your act together . Apparently not . But seriously . They're called snow plows , and I suggest you invest in some . 
school ? what's that again ? 
Pi Phi Love <3 
I love seeing \Robert E . Lee\ " listed in my birthday notices on facebook ..... " 
I love it when the movies on tv are * exactly * what you wanted to watch but didn't even realize . 
Buon Compleanno a mio babo < PROPFIRST > Chapman !!! 
In Cumberland , MD , it is illegal to keep a chicken with you in a hotel room . Just sayin ' 
So , as < PROPMALE > protests and revolutions are happening in Tunisia , Egypt , and Yemen , the leading news story everywhere is snow . Here's a concept , news broadcasters , how ' bout informing me about the things I * can't * figure out by looking out my window ?? 
every now and then I look up plane tickets to various places in Europe . I really ought to stop torturing myself . 
\Whenever people agree with me I feel I must be wrong . \ " \ 
\What's that big glowing thing in the sky ? \ " \ 
I keep listening/watching/reading the news and hoping for some type of miraculous overnight resolution of all the problems in Egypt , < PROPFIRST > , etc , etc , etc . 
\I see the gentleman is not in your books 
I think that in between Shakespeare and theses , I'm going to be re-reading some Redwall . RIP , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day to evvvvvvvvvvvvrybody !!!! 
promises to stop yelling for the next year . Really guys , I'll use my inside voice . 
Apparently someone else recently logged in as me , so if you got any odd messages or posts from \me\ " I apologize and promise it wasn't me . " 
In Lexington , it's spring . Seriously . There are crocuses crocusing and forsythia blooming . In Cumberland .... forecast for snow next week ..... Thanks , Feb Break .

reallyreallyreallyreally hopes to hear soon that < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are okay ..... 
Oh , hey , time change ! That's why I feel slightly underslept ... 
I'm pretty sure most of my academic experience can be summed up in one word : pettifoggery . 
thank God everyone I know in Japan is okay 
New life goal : become < PROPFEMALE > of Toledo . Now I just gotta find me an Italian duke and a whole lotta silk . 
Am I being redundant or just rhetorically symmetrical ? 
My week : Much Ado about .... EVERYTHING . 
Nothing is left for you at this moment but to laugh .

Come see Much Ado about Nothing tonight in the < PROPMALE > Theatre !! It's free and will be lots of fun !!

ANYONE who is interested in acting for Shakespeare this spring term should put something together for our SHOWCASE !!! Auditions are this week , email me if you're interested !!!! 
this sketch has become too silly . 
Cooking is great : it's a societally acceptable excuse to play with knives and fire . 
To all the NON-Art History majors out there , I have a question for you : what is < PROPMALE > ? define as succinctly as possible . 
I feel like I need free coffee from the coop more this week than I will next week .... 
The weather might be the only redeemable part of today . 
Some days I'm glad I'm graduating soon . Today is one of those days . 
First all-nighter in college career ..... the night of the last day of Winter term classes .

Home for spring break ! 
< PROPFIRST > , Goodness , and Mercy will follow me all the days of my life ... 
On second thought , let us not go to bohemian rhapsody . Tis a silly place . 
I refuse to revel in anyone's death . I hope Osama's death leads to greater peace in the Middle East instead of retributions and greater danger for the men and women still in harm's way . 
Semiotics are SO MUCH FUN :)
