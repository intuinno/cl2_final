I am Happy as of this second lets see if thats gonna change :) 

Yay today is my B-day now 17 feel kinda old but one step closer to being legal !!!! 
yea so i broke up with my now ' ex ' < PROPFIRST > a while ago like last saturday barely changing my status to single lol 
well ... i dont mean to be rude but something is a bit odd if you know what i mean ... 
I cannot wait i am ready to go already sooo ready :) 
I do not want to go to work tomorrow but it looks as if no one can cover for me so i have to go , then rush back home to get ready for the wedding tomorrow ... ugh !! 
Gonna watch < PROPFEMALE > R.I.P it's been 14 years 
tired and bored hoping i past this time ... 
< PROPMALE > is going to end up stressing me out < PROPFEMALE > ... much 
< PROPFEMALE > tired of work and school combined ugh ... 
Kinda tired yet I am still in so much pain ! 
well I am gonna start some training today the sooner the better ... 
I wanna leave already .... 
yesterday was so much fun and i hope to do tht again soon :) 
so i was listening a c.d from a guy that i met on the beach and sorry but the music was not the best :( 
I am ready to go far away from vegas :) 
tomorrow is gonna be fun :) 
I am still not even close to being finished with sorianos homework 
this sucks , I have to go to the doctors no school for me today 
I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > you crack me up in anatomy class 
\When the new day breaks I'am left a fool . Tick Tock the clock is gettin ' louder ready for me to decide . \ " How i feel right about now :/ " 
I hate how some people are so stuck up and only care about themselves , there is more to life than just us ! 
Life is really like a gigantic Box of Chocolate's never know what is to come next <3 
I still have more h.w to do but I just want to sleep 
Does anyone know if Soriano's vocab is due tomorrow ? 
It is crazy how life completely unfolds right before my eyes , I am sad , excited , nervous all at the same time . I just hope everything is for the best . <3 
Does anyone get what exactly we have to do for the quarter project in Chemistry for Naugle's class ? 
had a great night but this thought is going to haunt me of what could've been . 
aww i love my friends the best people in the world ... i will miss you all sooo much . 
so it turns out that I am leaving to Cali tonight going to < PROPFEMALE > around the beach ugh ... but I am going to miss everyone sooo much . :/ 
it is ridiculous when people younger than you , talk down on you like they lived alot longer so they must be wiser . yea sure . 
I am beyond done with everything . so serious 
Just got home from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and I couldn't be more ready than I already am for change . 
Its so sad < PROPMALE > year is over and my senior year will NOT be the same as this year without all of my lovely friends ... I will miss everyone . 
Well it couldn't be much more clear to me that my co-workers do not like me , yet I have no idea why . 
In life people part ways , say goodbye and move on , things change and things that are important today may not be so important tomorrow . In life change comes in all different ways shapes and forms , nothing can ever be guaranteed in life , nothing but change , and I couldn't be any more prepared for change . 
Watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding its < PROPFEMALE > hilarious , one of my favorites . :) 
listening to Summer Nights by Lil < PROPMALE > , i love this song , brings back some amazing memories <3 :) 
So my mom was trying to tell my family to not waste water bottles and use a \Markie\ " to write our names on them ... she meant Marker . hahahaha she reminds me of me . " 
Watching 40 days and 40 nights , < PROPMALE > Hartnett is so gorgeous ;) 
Congratulations to this years Seniors class of 2010 , “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams . Live the life you have imagined . ” <3 
watching Blow one of my favorite movies :) 
I have so much energy right now and theres nothing for me to do cuz its 4 in the morning . :) 
Not that tired but I have to get up early so I guess I should sleep :) 
Anything worth having in life never comes easy . 
Watching the Lakers game and I kinda hope the Celtics win . :) 
I'm so glad that the Celtics are beating the Lakers . :) 
this game is < PROPFEMALE > close and I want the Celtics to win so bad . :) 
so bummed i rly wanted the Celtics to win 
Work was actually decent today . No drama , thank god . :) 
I just finished Shampooing the carpet ... now i'm exhausted . 
to be able to give is a true blessing , but the gift I love , is the feeling that I get when I do a good deed , the receiver just made my whole day , and he hasn't got the slightest clue . :) 
I'm starting to realize things , shedding light on situations and although I wont like the outcome , it's best for me and I'll just cope but I will definitely move on . :) 
going to take my senior pics soon , I hope they turn out ok . :) 
My Madre randomly started blasting Daddy Yankee , I didn't even know she knew of him . hahaha :D 
I hate being sick , I've been in bed like all day and all I want to do is go out . :/ 
Alright , I'm bored so ' Like ' this status and I will describe you in one word . :) 
So I was at work today and some random lady was on the phone she looks at me and says oh so and so said I can use the phone , I was like yea go ahead . She then turns to me and tells me about her marriage problems from 17 yrs back and tht her husbands cheating on her and that I should never get married and I'm like mhm , this lady is crazy and wth is she tlking to me about this . :/ there are some strange ppl out there . 
Change is always good , It helps me realize what I've been taking for granted and what I've been missing out on . :) 
I deserved better all along , just didn't realize it , I now do . :) 
Just got home , had an amazing night , reminisced on old memories ; the joys of life are absolutely free . :) 
I am so upset just found out my mom threw away all of my jewelry by accident while moving . 
\I’m still proud of the fact that I was the one thing you couldn’t pin down with your logic . \"" 
\there's a blue horizon 
So blessed to have such amazing friends who know just what to say . 
Had fun tonight , I will miss everyone so much ; I'm so blessed to have such amazing friends in my life . :) 
I miss my baby < PROPFEMALE > , just heard her voice on the phone saying \tia lala \"'; although she's a handful she is so precious to me . :) " 
I met < PROPFIRST > and his amazing family when my family moved to the apartments we live in now ; he helped move our funiture without asking for anything in return , he did an amazing act of kindness . How I wish there were more people like him in the world , He and his family are now moving . He has a huge heart of gold he adopted all 8 of his children and ... 
Start my first day of school tomorrow thanks to late registration . :) 
To all my amazing friends have fun at the senior sunrise thing tomorrow morning , I miss you all !! 
I feel nauseous , this can't be good hoping I don't have food poisoning like my lil sis . 
Turns out it is true , everything does happen for a reason ; I just may like senior yr at Green Valley . :) 
I have absolutely nothing sober to say to you . 
I had so much fun today , I'm surprised to say this but I'm glad I go a regular high school ! :) 
Guess I will be pulling an all-nighter .. just lovely ! 
A 13-year-old boy in Texas shot himself in the head after years of bullying/torment for being gay . < PROPMALE > Walsh , also 13 , hung himself from a backyard tree . < PROPFIRST > Clementi , 18 and a freshman at Rutgers , jumped off the GW Bridge after his roommate broadcast live video of < PROPFIRST > with another guy .
