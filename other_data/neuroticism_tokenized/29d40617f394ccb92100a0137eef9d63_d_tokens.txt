Happy New Year ! 

Off for a walk 
should be cleaning instead of checking fb 
Spent a cozy evening with the in-laws learning how to make wine . 
Had a fantastic first day of work 
Snow storm , spa day , Christmas , I like December . . . 
So many nice people in Aspen . . . 
Back to cat hair and no magically appearing bedtime snack . Reality can be so cruel . 
Snow day !!!! 
Making real hot chocolate , with milk , and the stove . After that maybe I'll start recruiting for a pizza night . . . 
is wondering what possessed the flight attendant to try to convince me that orange juice is much better than coffee . . . I would have thought it would have been easy for him to see I'd been up all night and might snap without caffeine . . . 
must study . . . 
working . . . 
I heard a 10 year old recite 49 digits of pi at the airport . Groovy . . . 
I love my new phone . 
Loving the Belvedere's dollar kobe sliders 
Hmmmm , people from a local church just brought their children to our door and forced us to take a bag of canned goods . I guess because I don't choose to live in the suburbs I'm starving and should be grateful for corn syrup laden food ? I'm confused . . . 
Loving my new IPad . Best husband ever ! 
Thank you do much for all the birthday wishes . You helped make it a fantastic day !
