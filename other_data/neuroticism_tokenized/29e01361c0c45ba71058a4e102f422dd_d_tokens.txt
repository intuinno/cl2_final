Is awaiting the arduous journey ahead and the long awaited return ! 
is finally back ! 
has finally fixed the cigarette lighter in the car . That pesky wire got it's ass kicked finally ! 
I'm annoyed because when I record , I can't use both audio cards simultaneously . I have to switch between the two during recording ! I made this too complicated ! 
I broke out the mortar magnet(hookah ) and fixed the porch swing !

is still tired of the Nashville area being submerged under water ! 
has set up an interesting light display in the room ! 
When I watch my girlfriend's sugar glider , I feel like he might eat airplanes and helicopters while we sleep . I'm glad we have him caged up and we also don't feed him after midnight . 
is getting ready to move into an apartment . 
is now settled in at the new apartment . 
It irritates me we live in a society of instant answers . If it's not on a HD TV or an iPhone screen , people are completely lost . Open a damn book and read ! 
hopefully , my damn car only has a minor problem . I'm taking it in to get it looked at . 
is looking forward to a relaxing day with < PROPFEMALE > . 
is getting ready for another long ass day at work and then preparing for drill weekend again . I'm exhausted . 
had his car broken into and CD player broken into . I want to snap some necks . 
They ball-gagged Lady Justice\ 
And blindfolded her so she can't see\ 
The erosion of the people's trust\ 
Of what will come to be an FDIC Assisted Suicide\ 
\ 
The depression of a depression\ 
Worldwide suicide for the economy\ 
Caused by the dialectic chaos when the\ 
Mob on Wall Street took \We the People\ " for a ride\ 
The Leader of the New World Order , the President of the United States\ 
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A\ 
Without the RFID chip , you're just an illegal alien\ 
An enemy combatant of < PROPFEMALE > , welcome to the New World Order\ 
This is the end of the road ; this is the end of the line\ 
This is the end of your life ; this is the . . . 
See ... I get addicted to these little Facebook apps on here and then there's a problem with the server and I can't get on there . Damn you Facebook and your vapid mind control ! 
It's going to be a long ... long ... weekend , with work that is . 
is tired of the same routine . When is my day off ? 
is creating another avenue for \civilized debate\ " on my wall again . Insert your issues and concerns here and it will be debated by our devoted FB team ! " 
Should I get the Samsung Epic or the Evo 4G ? 
I just got the epic ! 
Im stuck up at radioshack bored off my ass . 
I am now caught up in the pointless status updating on my smart phone . :-[ 
is having dinner at Fulin's in Spring Hill . I'm waiting on my Beijing duck and smoked eel to get here ! 
we just ate korean food with my parents . it was great ! 
Is it the red wire or the blue ? I can't tell ! 
Great ! Our internet is shut off and I can't get my phone to work as a wireless hotspot , so I'm still working on it . 
The wireless hotspot now works ! 
Since when did Facebook become AKO ? How annoying ! 
I just finished several hours of training at Home Depot . 
Is doing well at home depot . I see much opportunity here . 
Is drinking a patron < PROPFEMALE > and about to have a hopefully relaxed day tomorrow . 
I love you , meek meek ! 
Has now changed his status . 
Its been one hell of a weekend and that's not a good thing . I'm tired of all the drama and just want to relax . 
Is looking forward to spending some time with < PROPFEMALE > . I just wish we didn't have conflicting schedules . 
Happy thanksgiving ! 
Opeth : the lotus eaters , live concert at the < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > hall . 5:02 - 5:28 wtf ? 26 seconds of silence then off rythm guitar ! Ha ! How did they screw up that bad ? 
Ho ho ho ! ... christmas party at drill ... hooray ... I can hardly contain my excitement . 
Has been feeling like crap today . It must be a nasty head cold . Ugh ! 
New years is going to blow , have to work at 5 in the morning and < PROPFEMALE > is not here . Guess what ? I've had 4 hours of sleep so far this week , great ! 
I long for the ice cold wilderness , endless evergreens , the undying sun , and the northern lights . Take me away to Alaska ! The last earthly frontier . 
Is really growing weary of this gossip factory called Facebook . 
Is really sick ... again ! Arg ! 
at this point , I'm not interested in facebook games or apps , so please stop blowing me up with requests . 
There's nothing left for me here . I should just leave . 
Is watching the chaos in Egypt and wondering what will transpire . Will the people gain democracy or will The Islamic Brotherhood gain power ? 
If anyone is curious about my musical endeavors , check out www.myspace.com/tempestofanguish 
I'm still heartbroken and I'm desparately trying to clear my head . This will take some time I guess . 
Hell yeah Packers 
I realized today that a part of me is gone . I feel as though I lost my soul . The person I truly was . I don't know how to get it back . Has anyone ever felt this way ? 
Its amazing how the person that was your life for the last two years can instantly have such contempt for you in an instant . I'm not even sure this is the same person I knew . Everything gets warped into looking completely like your fault and everyone supports them for it . 
I suppose I should take the effort in removing some photos and placing ones with someone else as my default profile picture . 
Please pray for the people in Japan in their time of need . 
Top of the mornin ' to ya on this fine St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day !. 
... so I decided to buy a new iPod today and went to update to my pre-existing library . Great huh ? Well , apparently I was in for more than I bargained for . My computer keeps crashing when I start iTunes and the lovely blue screen of death appears . I can't just have shit that works . That would just be too simple . This is going to take quite some time to troubleshoot . 
In addition t the lack of music on my new iPod , Sprint decides to finally introduce Android 2.2.1 on my Samsung Epic . Well , the bugs haven't seemed to be completely worked out because my settings were changed , I can't modify my photos , my energy saving apps are reconfigured , and my alarm clock was removed . Why can't things just work like they should ? 
In your face Apple ! Since iTunes was crapping out on my computer , I downloaded Sharepod ! Now I don't have to deal with incompatibility gayness from you anymore ! 
So apparently waterspouts on the Persian Gulf are apart of something called HAARP , a man made weapon of mass destruction that incinerates everything it comes in contact with . Hahaha ! Its like a fire tornado from a bad science fiction movie and people believe it to be true because there is a Youtube video\ 
about it !

I'm waiting word on my bid for a Trifield BroadBand 100XE Meter . I think I'll be able to make some interesting discoveries with this device if I win it on Ebay . If anyone is curious on what it does , comment below ! 
The next douchebag that disrespects me on my < PROPFEMALE > will be deleted forever ! I don't care what your rank is either ! I'm done . 
Some people will do anything to gain approval , including decimating someone else's character . They only have a small fraction of understanding of the bigger picture . 
Predators win against the Ducks 4 to 2 ! 
Its 6:30 in the morning and I'm here in Lumber . Ugh ! Keep coming torrential rain ! 
My phone is giving me massive problems . It refuses to read my micro SD card and keeps overheating ! Ahh ! This pisses me off ! 
Its all fun and games till smeone looses an eye ! 
Osama Bin Laden was killed by a bomb ! 
So ... Muslim burial at sea ? His mumified remains should have been put on display at the Smithsonian . 
I lost my contacts folks , so send me your phone < PROPFIRST > again in a private message if you wish to stay in touch . 9313345963 
Complete Garbage ! Predators lost 4-2 to the Canucks . What the hell is a Canuck anyway ? Maybe we can pull this off in Vancouver . It's not over yet ! 
... alone as usual 
I'm just waiting for this cicada infestation to finally die off . I'm tired of being attacked by the disgusting little bugs . 
What's on your mind ? 
You know I really beginning to despise FB because it has become an outlet for gossip and unwanted opinion . Some people don't understand discretion on here . 
I'm excited about working with a former NASA scientist tomorrow . I'm just going to help him and his wife around their house . 
Perhaps one day I'll become such a calloused individual that I just won't care at all . I am the biggest fool for trying to force my own < PROPFEMALE > . I am the biggest fool for trying to make sense of the unsensible . 
I just got a job with a subcontactor for Nissan ! 
I'm done with the psychopathic females ! 
Some people on Facebook seem to be spying on me . What are you looking for ? 
I'm just in my room contemplating things . I'm listening to an old album by Dream Theater : A Change In Seasons . How incredibly appropiate for the mood ! 
English please ... I have no idea what that means . 
< PROPFEMALE > foxtrot yankee < PROPFIRST > uniform < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > november uniform november < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > tango < PROPFEMALE > november < PROPFEMALE > tango hotel < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > papa yankee < PROPFEMALE > november < PROPFEMALE > papa < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > tango < PROPFEMALE > tango < PROPFIRST > yankee < PROPFIRST > uniform < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > tango < PROPFEMALE > tango uniform < PROPFEMALE > ( in honor of our military wherever they may be ) . Let's see who gets it and follows the instructions 
I spent much time today gaining insight into myself and understanding my interpersonal relationships with people . I've become so jaded that I've blocked them all out on certain levels I shouldn't because of mistrust . I hope that one person in particular understands I'm incredibly sorry and will forgive me . I'm only human and not some machine programmed by some enviromental device . 
I don't know what to think of this < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > court case ruling and I understand why the evidence given did not support reasonable cause for a guilty verdict . Personally , I believe there was a lot more details hidden within this . Perhaps the entire family was covering up the murder or someone within the family knows what happened . What a horrible situation ! 
Well , I guess it's time to get ready for drill again ... 
Of course he would ! Fire always beats ice , besides how can you beat an undead ninja with an incredibly fast spiritual spear anyway ? 
Time for another 9 and a half hour shift at Nissan . I'm so tired . 
How about we all proofread our posts before we post it on my wall . Thank you . Management . 
Well , another 9.3 hour day is over and I'm about to crash . 
I'm so pissed off ! Now I can't go back to sleep and want to put my fist through something if I wasn't so tired ! 
I can't express the level of frustration I have in words right now , so I will just go with a * errrrr * . 
Massive overtime $$$ ! 
My pet frog < PROPMALE > is all hyper this morning . He was excited to get his power pellets and he's swimming rapidly in his aquarium looking for more . 
Well , time to enjoy approximately 24 hours of freedom , mostly spent asleep . 
... isolation again 
O 
Bored as hell ... 
I'm really angry about this AWOL soldier found with weapons and Jihadist material ! He needs to < PROPFEMALE > for this ! 
I finally got her to tell me the truth after this long ... I really hate her for this . 
OBAMA INHERITED : a AAA credit rating ; $1.61 gas ( as of 12/31/08 ); 5.4% unemployment ; and an 8 trillion dollar debt ( accumulated since 1776 , that was called “devastating”) . 2 and 1/2 years later , we have an AA+ credit rating , nearly tripled gas prices , 9-10% unemployment & the debt ceiling is 17 TRILLION . Some STILL say this is a good job ! Not sure who is scarier Obama or his supporters . < PROPFIRST > DON’T LIE ! Repost a lot of people are liking this but it needs to be reposted for others . 
Our government has overstepped it's bounds again ! The Department of Justice has seized hardwood from Gibson Guitar claiming that the origin of the wood comes from Africa-that it is the equivalent to blood diamonds . I'm really sick of the libtards who run the show ! Boot them out ! 
To everyone who is curious in advance why I won't answer my phone , the screen is broken . 
Hopefully , I should have a new phone and be back in service on Tuesday afternoon . 
The new special edition Opeth Heritage album came in the mail today with an autographed cover , CD , and DVD ! Kickass !
