How is it possible to know the difference between right and wrong when everything around me is just in different shades of grey ...? 

Just got a Facebook . Yay 
Time to do a last minute attempt for Shearhart's Scrapbook 
You never know whats out there til u take the time to actually see it 
There is only one week until graduation . Man ... time flies 
Looking forward to sco-show , but not the next day . :( 
Ppl in my group for sco show , be sure to bring everything u need for tomorrow . if u have any questions , call or text me 
I hate the feeling of not being able to fall asleep . 
Thinking about giving gifts tomorrow . Uh ! Galaya-laya ! 
Tomorrow is the last day of my high school career ! Woohoo ! 
Reminising . It is a bittersweet thing , but i love it . 
People only have control over u if u let them . Drama only takes u if u allow it to take root in your heart . 
Tomorrow ... it hasnt even hit me yet ... 
Hanging with my sister . :D I love her tons 
Sitting in the auditorium seperated from my friends for seven hours . This sucks 
Sitting alone on a bus makes one think ... God get me out of here 
Im done with high school . I know im gonna miss these people some day , but right now I am way too excited to get on with life in the real world . 
I feel so great . Im surrounded by the people I love most . 
Forget people . The human race is just going down the hell hole 
< PROPFIRST > crenshaw needs a ride from pipe creek . If u can give him a ride either call me or him 
On the road . Yay vacation !! 
Getting a pedicure ... i feel girly . 
I was at the beach all day today . Man I feel good . 
Weezer and Offspring are a match made in heaven . 
I miss you , and its only been five hours .... 
There is peace in nature . We as humans just have to take the time to find it . 
\You have been weighed . You have been measured . And you have been found wanting . \"" 
Who cares ? 
Lets travel to new heights , and see whats beyond the horizon . 
Solitude slowly leads to insanity in the summer . We need to find time to be with friends 
Is it possible to love something so much that you cry about it ? I dont know if Im an over-grown baby , or just another sensative human being . There should be a T-shirt that says , \Dont judge me because my emotions come out as salty water droplettes \"" 
Awkwardness is just a word for not knowing what to say when you need to say it . 
I love talking to my grandparents . I always learn something new . :) 
Wonderful day ! Almost won a game of heroclix . < PROPFIRST > cheated . ;P I feel like such a nerd . 
Life , < PROPFEMALE > , and the pursuit of happiness ... sometimes it seems like they dont exist . Maybe they never did .... 
Lost in a new book . If you dont hear from me in a few days , send out a search party . ;) 
Doing nothing exhausts me more than working ... ugh 
Your breath fills me with life . The beat of your heart fills me with joy .... I hope that never changes . 
Who knew so much happiness could come from such a small package ? 
Insomnia can kill ... just look at what happened in Fight Club . 
You never know just how much your fam(ily ) means to you , until you notice that they really are gone ... 
Fireflies are the key to world peace . They bring joy to the cruelest of hearts . =) 
Working at a daycare ... worst headache i have ever had . But hey , its money 
Comic Con today ! Damn I feel like a nerd . Good thing when I get there i wont be the only one . :D 
People can change their names , their clothes , their whole appearence ... but they can never change who they are inside . 
Watching ... waiting ... the inevitable is near . Trying to prepair for something that is going to turn mine and many other worlds around .... I only wish I knew how bad it is going to be . 
Living in fear isnt really living . 
Its hard work prepairing for a new baby ... calf that is . 
Damn you military , you took another one from me .... < PROPMALE > Mills leaves tomorrow . 
Tonight is so beautiful . Almost mesmorising . 
When one assumes , one leaves a lot of room for error . 
I wish I wasnt so indecisive ... 
Shaking with anticipation . 
Off on a new adventure ! 
Team Gold ! Woohoo ! 
Great day overall . :) 
One of those days where even if I am physically awake , I don't think I am mentally .... I hope I don't have a personal < PROPFIRST > Derdan . 
< PROPFIRST > Scissorhands . :) Classic . 
\Now thats high quality H2O \"" 
\Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? \"" 
Kitten adopted me today . :) It was fate 
Mexican birthday party ... man im pooped . 
\Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream ? \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe " 
Many might consider rainy days miserable . I think they hold just as much opportunity as any other day . :) You just have to look a bit harder to find it . 
Lazer tag , new clothes , and getting my ears repierced . :) I rest my case . 
\Dont break me down . You're all I need . Make my heart a better place ... give me something I can believe . \ " -- Within Temptation " 
Me n < PROPFEMALE > made up a skit idea called Pity Party Palace : where anyone can celebrate in their own miseries , plus pizza ! 
I'm so confused . 
You have been away too long ... * sigh * 
Good quality time with the family . 
Hangin with my beautiful mother . :) 
\Ive got an answer . Im going to fly away . What have I got to lose ? \"" 
Work . Yay snotty little kids ! 
It is senseless to worry about things you can't change . 
My family has arrived ! Yesssss ! 
Making homemade icecream . Yum ! 
My car is breathing its last . :( He is going in for surgery today . 
I could really use a wish right now ... 
Shout out to all < PROPFEMALE>'s Web Cast and Crew . \Who says we can't be friends ? \ " ;) Oh how I love nestalgia . " 
Its like yelling , and screaming to a brick wall . Even when I do nothing wrong , its my fault . 
Got my books , and my tuition is paid for . I am so ready for next week . :) 
I finally saw Inception ... dreams will never be the same again . I will always wonder , \Did I come up with this on my own ...? \"" 
\Turtles are my philosophy of life . You can't get anywhere without stretching your neck out . \ " -- < PROPFIRST > Hayes I love you Papa " 
Reoccuring nightmares ... what happened to dreaming of flying into clouds of cotton < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Free day tomorrow ! yay 
Classes tomorrow . I hope I don't completely freak out . 
Back to School Bingo tonight ! :) I'm so excited . I love Schreiner ! 
Bingo was awesome ! lol 
I think my brain was just drained out through my eyes ... 
\Somebody's head will role for this ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland ( the original ) " 
Back at the dorm . I wish I could have stayed home longer . But its ok . :) I will be back next weekend 
There is no one to blame , but I can't help but feel like there is . If there was ever a time for you to be strong , its now . We all love you Kat . Please pull through this . Remember , \Let the circle be unbroken \"" 
If there was ever need for a miracle , now would be a great time . 
So much reading in so little time 
I find it a miracle that I even have friends . Im such an awkward person .... 
\I'm happy . I'm feelin ' glad . I got sunshine in a bag . I'm usless but not for long . My future is comin ' on . \"" 
After the Medical Careers Club meeting , I'm not so sure I want to sell my soul for the possibility of getting into a school which might prepare me for a job I may love or hate .... 
One chapter of biology down , two chapters of chemistry to go .... 
How can this < PROPFEMALE > hold up that building if the < PROPFEMALE > is cracking at its base ? 
Wonderful weekend . I love my family . :) 
Chemistry must mess up the brain . I sware , no chemistry teacher that I have ever had has ever made sense to me . 
Test day tomorrow . I have a test in Biology , Chemistry , and Calculus II .... sigh ... 
I feel really confident about biology . Lets hope i feel the same about chemistry 
I just got back from one of the most moving Drinking and Driving presentations I have ever been to ... it really makes one realize how precious life is . Treat everyday like your last and live it to the fullest . Treat everyone around you with respect , because one day they are there , and one day they could be gone . 
You know what ? God is good . 
Had an awesome girls night out with < PROPFEMALE > Light , < PROPFEMALE > Garza , and the most awesome room mate in the world Devyn Ullevig . :D 
The world must really hate me right now . drip ... drip ... drip .... But no one will listen . But the computers wont work , and no one will pick up my maintenance form . I hope Devyn Ullevig and I dont drown in our sleep . 
Maybe my air conditioner will actually be fixed today ... heres hoping 
I miss my family ... too bad half of them are going to be gone this weekend . :( 
Now that my battery is re-charged , I think I can make it through the week with relatively little pain . Bring it on rain ! I'm ready for ya ! 
Since when did college turn into a high school repeate ? 
I'm zoning out , yet I have tons of things I need to do ... thats not good . 
I was planning on going home this weekend . Sadly , plans change . 
Tomatoe soup to-go , carrots , and triscuits for lunch . :D today is a good day 
Sorta sick , but I have to go to a lab in an hour ... oh well . 
Four besties in Delaney 208 ! It sure is great !!! 
I have stared at my Calculus II homework for an hour ... I need help ... 
Sometimes , there are just no words that can describe . 
I love you < PROPFEMALE > . I miss you every day . 
Awesome night of lazertag and bubbles . :D 
\You do something to me that I can't explain . So would I be out of line if I said I miss you ...? \"" 
My room mate is gone , and I am all by myself . :( i wish i had someone to talk to 
It feels so good outside ! I love fall ! 
Decisions , decisions ... not my strongest subject . 
Listening to \The Dark Side of the Moon\ " and trying to finish my < PROPMALE > project . Ah ... relaxation . " 
Not feeling good at all , but things seem to be going my way . This is a very wierd day . 
An awesome weekend hanging with my friends and family . Bowling with < PROPMALE > Shearhart , Ttory Capes , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Konz and < PROPFIRST > Perna .

Love you guys ! :D 
My day has been made . :D 
I feel like sitting outside on my front porch at home and watching the stars . If only I could see the stars where I am . 
I like it strewn across the floor . 
Today needs to end . We need to go to the VHS player of life , rewind , and start all over . 
Why must things be so difficult ? \Forgive and forget\ " they sort of go hand-in-hand .... " 
Spending the rest of my fall break with my wonderful family . :D 
Fighting my brother for control of the computer . ;) I love that little booger 
Im so happy to be alive . :D 
Watching < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Live on Broadway . I am laughing so hard I can't breathe ! haha ! :D 
This doesn't feel like a Thursday . It has been too good to be a Thursday . 
History is cyclical . We have to learn from our past mistakes to break free and have a brighter future . 
Me : \I'm just giving you a taste of your own medicine . \ " Devyn : \ " Is it chewable ? \ " :D " 
“Nobody can go back and start a new beginning , but anyone can start today and make a new ending . ” -- < PROPFIRST > Robinson 
Dear Military , you have yet again taken one of the best we have . Take care of him , because all of us here at home want him back safely . He was my brother . I don't think I could stand to lose him .

Today marks three years together with the best man on this earth , < PROPFIRST > Chaffin ! I love you babe . :D

I dont understand how some people can be so heartless ....

The Walking Dead series is going to be awesome !!! < PROPFEMALE > Light and < PROPFEMALE > Garza better be prepared to hand over their tv every sunday at nine ! lol 
HAPPINESS ! 
Chemistry is blowing my mind ! 
When life throws us curveballs , it always feels good to run up to the pitcher and punch them right in the kisser . 
Who is your friend , and who is only posing ? Thats a good question ... 
\Im never going to catch my breath ! Say good-bye to those who knew me ! Boy was I a fool in school for cutting gym ! \"" 
Hanging with Miss < PROPFEMALE > Light listening to good disney music . :D a pretty good evening if i do say so myself . 
I am sooooo ready for this weekend 
Good weekend . I just hope all my studying pays off on thursday ... 
Memories of yellow roses and sweet words . 
Oh Braveheart soundtrack , you make my heart happy even on the worst days . :) 
Gangsters think they know tough , but they don't know anything until they have seen war . Support our troops this veterens day . They have given more than just thier lives to keep this country safe and free . 
Had the most awesome weekend ! I love my San Marvelous crew : < PROPFEMALE > Cox , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Guernsey , and < PROPFEMALE > Gaines !!!! I am going to miss you guys so much . Especially your cult chants . ( RIP < PROPMALE > Bear )

Working like mad on my presentation . Wish me luck .... 
Instead of fighting it all the time , try embracing it . :) things become a lot more pleasant . 
Trying to find a good monologue to try out for Antigone . Any suggestions ? 
Great weekend filled with well-needed relaxation . :D 
Oh how I missed my crazy family ! :D 
People are so selfish . They all feel like they are entitled to everything they want . They take advantage of others , step on them , and don't even feel a bit of remorse for what they do . In their minds they did nothing wrong . It makes me sick .... 
Amazing weekend with my most amazing friends . :D that was the best day I have had in a long time . I love you guys , and I cant wait for christmas 
To paint , or not to paint . That is the question . 
So , i finished my painting 6 and a half hours before it was due ... hahaha ! 
I forgot how difficult it was to memorize shakespearean language .... oh boy 
Well , here it goes !

Stuck between a rock and a hard place ... and simultaneously trying to study chemistry for friday . :P 
#88 : we met this semester . honestly i thought you didnt like me for a long time . But chemistry and biology have brought us together and I am so happy they did . :D you are one of my greatest friends here ! I love you ! and no matter where life takes us , I hope we can stay friends even after Schreiner is long behind us . 
#777 : well , a lot of stuff has happened this three years of knowing you . Extreme highs and extreme lows . But that is what has made us what we are . You are my best friend . You are my first love . And that is all the mushy stuff I am going to put as my status . :P lol 
695.598 : you are an interesting person . I wish we were closer friends . :P But all good things come with time I suppose 
You with all the fours , you were probably my first friend at schreiner . I know we go through these stages of being close , then being distant , but I will always remember watching south park with you and just being happy . :) I wish you the best out there in the world . I hope we can continue to be friends for a long time 
25 : we used to be really good friends in high school ... i dont really know what happened . you are an awesome person , and i know you will accomplish great things that people like me only dream of . Just keep doing what you're doing . Maybe one day we will start talking again , and possibly rekindle that wonderful friendship of ours . :) 
#1 : ... you ARE the best ! I barely even know you , but you and I clicked like we have known each other all of our whole lives . You are fun and happy and I looooove you !!!! 
#53 : there are absolutely no words to describe you ( and thats a good thing ) . You have this ability to make me smile no matter how shitty I feel , yet you are so intelligent and warm hearted . You and I have been through a lot together . We will always have that invisible bond , and i wouldnt trade it for anything . 
#143 : I wish we were closer , becasue I know we would have been really close had i taken the time . :) You are an amazing person , and not to mention pretty funny . ;) I wish the best for you 
13 : you and i have just recently become closer as friends . ironically from fighting over and over again ;) oh how i loved that day . You are a wonderful person and such a good friend . I wish we had gotten closer sooner , but i am so thankful that we got close when we did . :) Love ya 
009.5 : ... only you would choose a number like that . wanna cookie ? 
\You take the breath right out of me . You left a hole where my heart should be . We've gotta fight just to make it through . Cause I will be the death of you\ " -Breaking < PROPMALE > "

Lunch seems like a bad idea at the moment .... 
Yet another tie this year ... but i had a blast ! :D 
No rehersal today .... Now i dont know what to do with myself 
People say that life is all about taking risks . :) I guess I just started living 
Oh < PROPMALE > , you bring so much peace to my soul . :) 
\To see you when i wake up is a gift i didnt think could be real . To know that you feel the same is three-fold Utopian dream . \"" 
Crying induced headaches are the worst .... 
\Maybe some day we'll figure all this out . We'll put and end to all our doubt . Try to find a way to make things better now . \"" 
What a beautiful mess I'm in <3 
Perfect hiking weather ! Anyone want to join ? 
My computer was attacked with malware because I clicked on a picture of a lion ... damn . Oh well , its gone now . :)

Numb 
I love life's suprises sometimes . What started as a seemingly horrible day turned into one of the best days I have had in a long time . :) Just gotta be willing to find the happiness and it will come to you one way or another . 
Those who feel they are entitled are usually the least deserving . 
Eventful weekend full of thrust circles and other various suprises ! :P I will miss you San < PROPMALE > , but most of all I will miss the people I left there . I love all of you very much ! 
The juice is worth the squeeze . <3 
Antigone opens tonight at 7:30 and will be running through Saturday in the Hanzen Building at Schreiner . Everyone should come support this awesome cast :) And the cool thing is , its free ( but donations would be much appreciated ) . 
Sick ... 
Break a leg tonight cast of Antigone ! 
Slowly getting better ... but I still have so much to do . Problem set for chemistry , study for zoology test ... there are no brakes , even for the ill . :/
