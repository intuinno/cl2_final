While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND , & INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her , reminding her how beautiful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could take away her pain . While you make your woman CRY , there's a man stealing her smiles . Re-post if you're against domestic violence .
