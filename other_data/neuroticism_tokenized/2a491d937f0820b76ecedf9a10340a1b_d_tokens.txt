2 weeks til the first < PROPFEMALE > game . i can't hardly wait . i love big 12 football !! 
hmmm ... i wonder if the 10 blocks i walked to pick up the boys from school cancelled out the 12 cookies i ate earlier . kinda like a diet pepsi cancels a < PROPFEMALE > bar . 
23 hours til < PROPFEMALE > shows the football nation that they are once again a power house !! GO BIG RED !!! 
i'm a little upset that \retro\ " day during homecoming week means the 80's . surely retro still means the 60's ... right ?!? "

oh , the joys of motherhood !! at the er at 5:00 am with wy . 
my sister says she loves me , but hates the profile picture i had before . nice , huh ... 
1/2 of wy's room painted , a bright grass green . cookies made , cake baking , and both boys dressed , fed , teeth brushed and ready to walk out the door . 
had an aha moment a couple hours ago ! probably should have happened A couple months ago if not sooner but late than never ! 
can't wait for my date fri . night with the most handsome 7 year old that i know !! we're going to go see eclipse ( finally ) and maybe he'll hold my hand !! 
still haven't seen the movie , BUT the little boy's rooms are finally all painted . now i need to figure out to get that stinking cork board to stay on the wall . i hate it when < PROPFIRST > might be right !!! 
< PROPFIRST > may have been right , but i won !! the cork board is nailed onto < PROPFIRST>' precious walls . the little boy's rooms are looking pretty darn good if i do say so myself . now we just need the upstairs furniture to come in so i can unpack the rest of the boxes that are driving me crazy !! 
< PROPMALE > michaels .... need i say more ? 
Every time I start thinking too much about how I look , I just find a Happy Hour and by the time I leave , I look just fine ! 
“The death of a mother is the first sorrow wept without her” 
“'You'll get over it ... ' It's the clichés that cause the trouble . To lose someone you love is to alter your life for ever . You don't get over it because ' it ' is the person you loved . The pain stops , there are new people , but the gap never closes . How could it ? 
my mom died 2 years ago tomorrow . there isn't a day that goes by that i don't wish i could see , smell , touch one last time . i miss everything about every day . i would give 10 years of my life to have another 2 minutes with her again . i love you more , mom !! 
thank you everybody for all your thoughts and prayers . i had a very hard time this year , but my friends and family helped me more than words can say . THANKS AGAIN !! 
had a pretty good weekend at the mountains . i lost every dime i had . was going to sell some of < PROPFIRST>' liver since it regenerates , but well .... need i say more ? thank god he has 2 kidneys and he only needs 1 !!! 
FIVE-TIME NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPS \ 
“Not the victory but the action . Not the goal but the game . In the deed the glory . ” only 44 more day ... GO BIG RED !!!! 
trying very hard not to roll my eyes and shake my head !!! 
today is my friday !! 
had the best time EVER at the < PROPMALE > michaels concert !! well worth waiting 2 hours in\ 
3 1/2 inch heels !! 
is it friday yet ? 
is thinking no one is really who i thought they were , and it's throwing me for a loop !!! 
i've decided there is nothing in the world that can't be fixed by laying in the sun , a cold drink , the sprinkler running , and my favorite 2 little boys running around laughing and playing in outside !! 
my new mantra ... it's only hair , it's only hair , it will grow back , it's only hair , it's only hair , it will grow back !! 
it's early how can it already be one of those days ?! 
it's going to be a good day , a good good day ! ( i think ? ) 
ok , does anyone else see my hair lookin ' a little like malin's football helmut hair on \steel magnolia's\ " ? UGH .... " 
thinks jakob prescott is the most handsome 9 year old i know !!! 
today is the 1st day of my baby's last year in high school ! i'm so so sad ! i'm not ready at all !! 
welcome back old friend !! it's been too long !! GO BIG RED !!! 
great way to start off the season .... GO BIG RED !! 
i asked < PROPMALE > if he had any ideas about what he wanted for his senior pictures and he said \considering i didn't get to choose what i actually wore til the 6th grade i'm pretty sure i don't have much say in this\ " . hmmm .... i think that is a little bitter . like i'm controlling or something . GEESH .... " 
i hate < PROPFEMALE > michaels . i mean seriously what makes her so stinkin ' great ? who cares if she has her own tv series , dvd , games , a great body , and as much as i don't want to admit it , she may be pretty . she isn't very nice and that cancels out all of those things . right ? like the red light and that awful noise when i don't do things to her standards are going to motivate me ! seriously , does she know me at all ?!! 
pretty good weekend . my nephew < PROPMALE > was crowned homecoming < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > won his 1st football game . i spent time with good friends both friday and saturday , and i got to see my nephew < PROPMALE > for a few hours ! 
can you say COGNITIVE DISSONANCE !!? i can not believe the way some people can change the facts so they fit their lies . they need to look in the mirror and know what kind of parent they really are . their \friends\ " and \ " family\ " need to quit enabling them . you are doing them no favors ! you won't be able to change the kind of parent you are until you take the first step and admit you have COGNITIVE DISSONANCE !!! " 
today is another milestone in my babies life . we are getting senior pics done today . i'm going to try not to cry and take his lack of interest , participation , and enthusiasm personal ! 
had the best time ever last night !! alcohol whipped cream ... who would have thought of such a thing ?! < PROPFEMALE > , you will be the most beautiful bride !! 
PROMISE TO MYCHILDREN : I will stalk you , freak out on you , lecture you , drive youcrazy , be your worst nightmare , embarrass you in front of your friends , hunt you down like a bloodhound til the day you understand why I do it . Then I will know you are a responsible adult . All because I LOVE YOU . You will never find someone who loves you & cares about you morethan your mom ! Copy and paste if you are a MOM !!

getting ready to take wy to the hospital to get his tonsils out . thank god this is the last one to have this done . i'm too old for the stress ! please think of him today and say a little prayer !! 
wy is doing pretty good . has been sleeping most of the day . trying to get him to drink something when he does open his eyes , so we can go back to the room .
