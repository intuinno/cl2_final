Life is nothing but the vessel in which your soul moves from one point to another . suicide is nothing but a waste of time and all it does is move you back to the point you began . your soul restarts and you have to go through a worse life . until you move through this life you have nothing better to do . ride through this vessel and love your soul . just remember to respect death . and .... GIVE THE GRIM REAPER A HUG . 

The mind is a powerful thing . people always waste it . their full potential will never be realized . but once you realized how powerful your mind is you are able to detach from mortal bonds and raise up about the rest , showing superiourity to those below you . break your bonds and take charge . The Fates have nothing on you BREAK THE LOOM . CONTROL YOUR OWN STRING . MANUVER HOW YOU WANT . IT IS ALL YOURS FOR THE TAKING . 
Your enemies have the ability to poke and prod at you , they know your every weakness , even if you dont show it , the fates have conspired against you . These creatuers of darkness and light stand against you , take your weapon , ready yourself , destroy everything in your path . its yours for the taking . everything . destroy the ones who destroy you . FIGHT . WIN . YOU ARE IMMORTAL , SO PROVE IT TO EVERYONE . 
Your destruction is on its way , spreading like a fire , consuming everyone that is close to you before finally taking you , slowly driving you to insanity . But your insanity doesnt stop the pain , it just makes your life pass by slower , letting you feel the pain for longer , slowly burning your skin . You manage to sweat a bit , cool your life down just a touch and then the flames engulf you once again . 
Ive never known trust like the knights , they are my family , for family is much more than blood , we are perfection together , we shant be destroyed nor seperated , death shall never catch us . we will destroy all in our way . Let it be spoken , Let it be screamed , we will never ever take us alive . We wont be forgotten we'll never give in . Wolves forever , Okamigimi for eternity . 
I gots dragons blood . now my room will smell like insence again . 
< PROPFIRST > of the bells , most epic christmas song ever 
... So i tried to give blood today ... and they missed my vein . my arm hurts but ill live .

the gods wanted me to stay home today apparently . im sick and they cancelled school for me 
dont forget ... save it now ... or risk doing it again ! 
Ten months today , its been rough lately , but we have learned ways of coping and we are determined to make it work . I love you Ocean
