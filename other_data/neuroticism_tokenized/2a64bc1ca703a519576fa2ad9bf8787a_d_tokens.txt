I can't believe it has been 13 whole years . I don't know where the time went , but today they are teenagers ! Watch out world !!! 
Came home from a crap work day to shovel the driveway/street in front of my house to ensure I get to work tomorrow ( Why am I such an awesome employee ? ) . Just after I finished the pile at the street , a WONDERFUL snowplow guy started down the street , backed up and plowed my driveway/street for me !!! I could KISS that man . You know ... if I could have seen him ... and if he was cute ... and not married ... Stupid foggy glasses . 
Ready for the SNOW-NAMI !!! Just wish I didn't have to drive to work tomorrow .
