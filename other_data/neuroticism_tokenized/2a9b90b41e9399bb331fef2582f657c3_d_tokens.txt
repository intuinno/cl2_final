I used to do so many thing online , but these days , I don't even know what to do . I don't even remember what sites I used to go to . Right now , I just want to literally kill all the stupid ass people that makes me f*cking angry . 
The translations for Fullmetal Alchemist are way off . They totally used google translator . How gay . It was hard to understand the subtitles , but as long as you know the story line and read the manga , you're fine . 
I might or hope to go camping this summer . I need someone to go with me . Who's willing to ? If I do go , it's most likley to be beach camping . > : T

I want to do so many things , but school just gets in the way . 
I'm trying to do manga coloring ... So far , HORRIBLE . I'm only on the cleaning part , and I give up . I can't find a easier way for the cleaning . The directions aren't specific enough and there's nothing for Elements 8.0 . T T.T T 
I was watching a show about how a Korean plane crashed . During the reenactment , they repaced the Koreans with the Chinese . What the hell ?! D:< How can they mistake the difference of each Asian race -- , oh yeah , stupid white people . And that means all of you !!! 
I want cookies ... T T.T T

My parents are so retarded . They bought a fucking Karaoke machine that came with a light up disco ball . 
What's harder ? Chinese or Japanese ? Well , one person put : \Yellow people make hard language . \"" 
is sad that FMA officially ended . ;__; 
-sigh- I'm taking my braces off right after I take my picture for Los Osos . This sucks . * Sulks in the corner * 
< PROPFEMALE > doesn't want to go to tutoring today . < PROPFEMALE > thinks math is ewie . >.< She also thinks that the teacher sucks at teaching , so she won't be able to learn geometry properly and is going to fail next year . >.< 
-Sigh- No luck . 
Damn . < PROPFEMALE > must be VERY bored . 
I wanted to watch KWMS at the Apple store since there were a lot of computers , but < PROPFEMALE > didn't let me . > : T Now here I am at 1 AM watching now . Thanks Jenn . Love ya ' too , you little Dong-chan .

What would you guys rather do ? Do 20 pages of math homework that's due tomorrow , OR not do it at all ...?

If the lady who predicted 9/11 is right about WWIII in November 2010 causing a nuclear wipe out in the northern hemisphere , I wasted all my life in school . 
REMEMBER WHEN ... getting HIGH meant swinging at the playground ? The worst thing you could get from boys was c0oties ? ' m 0 m ' ( was your hero)and ' D a D ' was the boy you were gonna marry ? And your WORST ENEMIES were your siblings ? And rAcE iSsUeS were about who ran the fastest ? When-WAR-was a card game ? And life was simple and carefree ? Remember when all you wanted to do WAS GROW UP ? 
I have to friggin ' re-take the geometry readiness test tomorrow . Dammit Moksannim . Why did you come to Los Osos today ?! TT ~ TT

YAY ~ HE FINALLY SHOWED UP ! USUI HAS A LOVE RIVAL NOW ... >:] 
I . LOVE . THIS . EPISODE . 
I loved the guys ' reaction when You-kun hugged Misaki ~ Their reaction : HOLY SHIT ?! 
When mommy gets mad at me , I always say \I love you\ " to get off the hook . :) " 
I woke up at 6:30 ; went back to sleep . Then woke up at 7:30 ; went back to sleep again . Then woke up at 8:30 ; went back to sleep again . Now I woke up at 10 . 
Runny nose , sore throat , and an urge to cough ... Yeah , I think I have a cold . 
I'm bored . So here's a question : How would you feel if you listened to a song about food . Do NOT say \hungry\ " or anything else along that line . " 
Gah ... I don't want to re-create a twitter account just to follow my teacher . > : T 
My grandma has a spice that's older than I am . 
SNIFF . Curse you , runny nose !! I'm becoming like < PROPFEMALE > !! D: 
If I ever have a job that has me involved with entertainment -- like Disney , anime , TV , music , celebrities , etc . -- I'll be f*cking pissed off . Even if it pays a lot , I'll still be f*cking pissed off . 
I . Don't . Want . To . Go . To . School . 
Mmm ... Grilled sweet potatoes are the best when you're doing homework <3 * NOM * 
My teacher told everyone to follow her on twitter for HW assignments . So I re-created my account and only see that she's NOT on twitter . FFFFFFF .... 
< PROPFEMALE > said that her back was hurting ... So she lied down on a metal container ... 
First , I get a road burn of my knee . Now , I got a rug burn on the same knee ... ;______; 
Spent 30 minutes trying to kill a mosquito ... I don't know where it is now . 
Still at school . Waiting with my friend to go to tutoring . BORED ... 
Can't wait till club rush tomorrow ... It's pretty much the only reason I'm still in school .

A dentist invented the electrical chair . If you're more afraid of the dentist after hearing this , copy and paste it anywhere !! 
I need to study for sh*tty quizzes ... T.T Why can't days be 48 hours long and school hours at least stay the same or be cut back ? 
Stupid SAT essay . How is ' the mysterious ' NOT real ? Of course it's real ! Without it , we would still be cavemen ! 
Still wondering if I should go to that hiking trip to Cucamonga Creek tomorrow ... I wanna climb the waterfall !! If I do , I hope I can get home by 1 ... 
Having trouble trying to find a trail to Cucamonga Creek . Help . ;_____; No , it's not the one by Norco . I'm looking for the one by Sapphire and Almond St.

There is no one to talk to . 
I joined 5 clubs , go to < PROPMALE > classes on Saturdays , go to tutoring until 6 two times a week and always have school work , yet I feel like I do nothing . 
Today in Spanish , my teacher was talking about pronouns . He said , \She is dozing off . She is dozing off . SHE IS DOZING OFF . \ " Then I woke up . " 
Oh , sh*t . The more I re-read my paper , the more I wish I could edit it properly .

Whenever I draw something and don't finish it , I get back to it the next day and see that it looks weird ; so I have to fix it until I'm satisfied enough to ink it ... .________. 
Just passed by a house with a Christmas tree ... 
I think I saw CMS's lunch lady ... 
Really thinks that 2PM and all the other celebs should really get off their arrogant asses and get a REAL job that will actually help the world . 
Waking up to 2PM this early in the morning is NOT a good wake up call . 
< PROPFEMALE > , Joy , < PROPFEMALE > , you said that you guys would totally convert me into loving K-pop , but guess what ? I feel pure HATE for ALL of it . You fail . 
Well . Imma sleep at my mom's store . Wake me up at 3

How convienent is it that $10 only lasts me a week for lunch ... * sarcasm intended * -.- Lunch is so expensive when you put it that way . 
Imma get boba on Wednesday at my school's food fair . 
Is it wrong to like character deaths in a story ? 
Communist North Korea is serving hamburgers ... . §§§§§ . 
I didn't get home till now ... Time for some homework to do ... 
For scuba , our\ 
instructor lets the girls go first to use the tanks because we\ 
take a longer time getting dressed . After we were done , he let us go to\ 
our locker room to get changed . We still had 40 minutes left . 
Damn . I'm too early today . 
Food fair was bomb . x Couldn't find the In and Out stand though ... But I got my BOBA !! 8D

Who else thinks that people these days are so focused of the scent of the soap that it's up to the point where soap doesn't clean you anymore ... 
* Looks at homework * * sigh * 
Nobody lays a finger on my butterfinger . \

Getting spammed by 2 retarded , failed terrorists is not a good way to make a person in a good mood . 
Just finished the school's haunted house event . I liked the people who didn't < PROPMALE > us better .

Okay . I can handle people dying , but not dogs ! 
Is having a massive sneezing fit ... 
I need to sneeze , but it won't come out ... 
Is going to dress up for school tomorrow ... If I can re-make my costume on time ... < PROPFEMALE > is going to steal my Amu cosplay ... 
I don't think I'm going to dress up tomorrow . 
On the second thought ... I'll dress up as a simple school girl ... 
My feet hurt . I'm so sleepy . And I have cotton < PROPFEMALE > in my hair . 
Never make cotton < PROPFEMALE > if you're wearing a long sleeved shirt . 
Before , I was complaining that I had no storage ; now , I'm complaining about having too much ... 
Sometimes , Biology feels like English because of all the summaries to write and the Greek and Latin roots to memorize ... 
Ahhh , sh*t . Who knows how to do the BYOB thing for Hartz ? 
Man , these days , I'll never get home before 4 ..
