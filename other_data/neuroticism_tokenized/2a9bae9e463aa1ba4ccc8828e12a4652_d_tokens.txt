If you like this idea , please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many great fathers we can get on Facebook . ? 
In honor of Father's Day , I have changed my profile picture the man who has been more of a father to me than anyone . He may not be my father by blood , but he is by heart and soul . < PROPFIRST > Ritchie . =) <3 I know you don't use facebook , but thank you so much for being there for me , and my siblings . <3
