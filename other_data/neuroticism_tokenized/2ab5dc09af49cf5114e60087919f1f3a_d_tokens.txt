... my phone is working again ! It's a MIRACLE ! 
is too excited about her new Swiffer . 
loves that the first interview she gets is for a company that actually turns out to be a scam artist . 
won a free dinner for two anywhere in Stillwater , courtesy of Lights on Stillwater . :) I guessed how much < PROPFEMALE > was in the jar . 
is excited for the game tomorrow ! And COBRA ! 
' s phone has finally actually broken . 
Snail naming contest ... GO ! 
the snail is now named ... < PROPFEMALE > ! And my new fish is ... Obadiah ! 
thinks her fish are becoming friends . :) 
has spent around four hours in a practice room today and is entirely certain that she's not even the teensiest bit better . 
watched Milk for the first time . Incredible . 
is a big old sightsinging exam tomorrow with a certain scary Bosnian ... 
wants to know if anyone wants a fish !!! 
Hoover has a new home ! The little bully . 
dropped her phone down a freight elevator shaft . So ... don't try to call me . 
is much too dependent on her cellular device . 
thinks that < PROPFIRST>'s birthday went wonderfully ! < PROPFIRST > topher Firey 
had to exfoliate her lips this morning . Thanks , Accutane . 
got a much-needed haircut . And loooves her stylist . :) 
is in love with someone special . 
' s someone special is fixing dinner for her tonight ! 
wishes she could find a stupid pumpkin patch in Stillwater . 
mmmmm ... Bath and Body Works . 
had a pretty decent concert . :) 
is making blackberry cobbler ! 
thinks that those who are adamantly against abortion should be the ones handing out condoms on every street corner . 
thinks that sightsinging is a lot like getting an arm chopped off without anesthesia . Please let it be over soon ... 
is in Music History term paper hell . 
is enrolled to take 18 hours next semester . Neat . 
doesn't understand why she has to pay 65 dollars a ticket for Crossmen banquet . Shouldn't that have been covered in our outrageously high dues ? 
just found out that < PROPFIRST>'s new kitten needs reparative surgery on his leg that will cost between one and two thousand dollars . 
got a monologue for the V Monologues ! 
got a squirt bottle for the cat . Muahaha .

thinks that everyone should go see OSU's production of Lonely Planet . Absolutely beautiful . 
Again , if anyone can spare absolutely ANYTHING for < PROPFIRST > , we would appreciate it so much . We can do about $400 , but that's all the money we have . We need to raise about $200 by tomorrow . Please help 918-645-3786 . 
< PROPFIRST > is safe and home ! Thanks to everyone who helped out with his vet bills ! Now ... NEW SNAIL NAMING CONTEST . GO ! 
< PROPMALE > it is . To join the ranks of Captain < PROPFIRST > , Pongo , < PROPFEMALE > and Hardy , and of course , < PROPFEMALE > . 
wishes she got a real Thanksgiving break ... you know , the kind without a mandatory football game in the middle of it . 
didn't mean to update < PROPFIRST>'s status for him . I had quite the day . 
needs to practice for two juries and a piano proficiency , study for three finals , complete one project , and finalize a term paper . Good . 
is done with her Music History Term Paper ! AHAHA ! I am invincible ! 
had a great time last night at the Christmas party ! Thanks to everyone who came ! 
now has two Music < PROPMALE > caption pages to write , two juries to practice , three finals to study , and one kitten to cuddle . 
Apparently Christmastime is the only time of the year when Little People of < PROPFEMALE > become extremely employed by politically incorrect commercialized companies hoping to make their product more family-friendly in a holiday-centered TV spot . 
thinks that MacGamut is the most poorly-made computer program in existence . You can't notate during the play . To < PROPFEMALE > an existing quarter note , you have to click erase , erase it , click a quarter note , click a < PROPFEMALE > , and try your hardest to line it up , all the while forgetting the rest of the example . As opposed to drawing a < PROPFEMALE > on a piece of paper . Genius , right ? 
doesn't understand how she can be completely and fully awake after 3 hours of sleep . 
Here goes nothing , Music History Final and Percussion Jury . 
Thank God , my two hardest finals are over . 
Why don't zombies like < PROPFEMALE > Kern ? Because she doesn't have any brains ! 
thinks it's great to be back in Bixby , but misses < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > like crazy . :( 
suddenly misses all of her Southwind and Crossmen family like crazy . I hope all of you are doing well , and I hope that I can see you someday again . 
And I have read the < PROPFEMALE > seal , that tell of how the seedlings feel , reminds my heart what love can yield . 
is quite positive she has the best boyfriend in the entire world . Mr. < PROPFIRST > Firey . 
LOVED Avatar . 
missed the part in the Bible that said that if you have a ten-foot , thousand-light cross incorporated in the Christmas lights that surround your multimillion-dollar mansion- complete with a Range Rover and Hummer in the driveway- , complimented with a professionally done American flag display , you are justified in your outrageous , blatantly anti-Scriptural ostentatiousness . 
' s dinner date bailed , then she pathetically texted all of her friends for a dinner date , only to realize that everyone has already has plans . Good , because I love getting totally ready and sitting on my butt at home . 
ended up having a GREAT time at dinner ! 
invites EVERYONE to her church , Abiding Harvest United Methodist , for a Christmas < PROPFEMALE > play that will knock your socks off . 6pm , on 129th ( < PROPFEMALE > ) between 101st and 111th , Broken Arrow . My sister and I will be playing O Come < PROPMALE > ! 
ended a beautiful Christmas < PROPFEMALE > watching It's a Wonderful Life with the love of my life . 
had a wonderful Christmas , and hopes desperately that it wasn't her last one in Oklahoma . 
Um . Glass house , throw stones much ? 
All is well , the kitten will be cared for . 
is leaving tomorrow for the Bowl Trip . In the mean time : Pomplamoose , All the Single Ladies . Youtube . And ... Go . 
is having a very difficult time searching for a rent house around campus for Fall 2010 . Any suggestions ? 
does not know how to have a reasonable conversation with the inexplicably irrational . 
The 2nd time around , Avatar was EVEN BETTER . Thanks , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . 
started out the first day of new classes just super by missing her first one . 
No , Facebook , I do not accept your Wizardry Invitation . 
Lots of new photos ! 
Quote of the night : < PROPMALE > Bergeron , on stage , describing The Little Mermaid as \that fishy tramp \"." 
This weekend , my friend's and my aunt's dog died . Rest in peace , < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > . You will be missed . 
< PROPFIRST > picked up a new stray kitten . Her name is < PROPFEMALE > because she's quite the jazz singer . 
is taking care of a basket full of 20-day-old newborn puppies ! 
still cries when she sees The Notebook . Oh , young love ... 
played a Bb scale on a trombone today ! Sort of ... 
Hmmm , one month's rent vs . iPad . Sigh . 
No school ! Now time for MacGamut ... 
No , MacGamut . I WILL NEVER play ANY piece in tenor clef , especially one written in Gb minor . 
is becoming increasingly more aware of the atrocities that Biblical Christianity theologically advocates . Selling daughters into sex slavery , righteous killing of any dissenting opinion , imperialism , and genocide ... among others . 
just listened to the best percussion recital she's ever heard . Great job , < PROPFEMALE > . That was amazing . 
Apparently I look like < PROPFEMALE > Imbruglia . 
The new , simplified version of Facebook looks quite a bit more confusing . 
is not feeling the Music History exam tomorrow . 
might have pulled an A out of her butt on the Music History Exam . 
< PROPFEMALE > Palin- I have no idea how you got as far as you have . Really ? I mean , REALLY ? 
hopes to see everyone at the Monologues on Saturday , at 7pm and Sunday , at 4pm in the Student Union Little Theater ! Don't miss it ! 
Nothing like having your car spin off the road on your way to work that says , Good Morning . 
is hungry , fevered , exhausted , and unprepared . Happy Monday . 
had a decent percussion ensemble concert . Great job , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > ! 
Someone STOLE a puppy from the Humane Society on Saturday ! 
helped < PROPFIRST>'s little sister pick out a kitten from the Stillwater Humane Society this afternoon for her 11th birthday ! Whom I believe she named < PROPFIRST > ... 
wants to write a big note about big religion . But unfortunately , has to put if off ( again ) to another day . Thanks , Music History exam studying . :( 
thinks you should read Judges 21:10 -24 . Good luck . 
is mortified she stayed up this late to watch a movie on Lifetime . Furthermore , an < PROPFEMALE > Bynes movie on Lifetime . 
More fun and inspirational Bible verses : Judges 11:29 -40 . 
is having a bad day . 
is going to have to pay $400 for the ramifications of losing her keys . Good . 
Dear Ting Tings , just because you dress trendy , have unintelligible lyrics , and ooze with indie spirit , it doesn't mean you are good musicians . No , that's not your name . 
says a big thanks to her mailman , who put four letters in her mailbox and left it open . My mailbox opens on the top . And it was pouring outside . 
says , Congratulations to Washington DC today . Maybe the rest of the country can wise up . 
COOKED dinner . That's right , like REAL dinner . 
The brand new Brand New album leaves me feeling very unsatisfied and ... sad . Just because your name is Brand New doesn't mean you have to reinvent yourself completely on an album . Sigh . 
has officially started Spring Break ! 
got some great time with her wonderful aunt , Angi McNeil . Now off to Branson ! 
is in Branson ! 
thinks it's amazing the kinds of dream epics you can have when left to sleep over twelve hours . 
had another dream epic last night . This one involved me showing up for 2010 Crossmen Spring training with no music or instrument assignment . 
really liked Shutter Island , so there . And CONGRATULATIONS to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! She just got engaged ! 
Thank god we didn't run into the Duggars today at Silver Dollar City . Considering the predominant demographic , though , we might as well have . 
Happy days in Stilly with the psuedo-hubby . 
joined a gym , is on a diet , and wants a burger . 
GOP : Calm the hell down . Children with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage . College students can stay on their parents ' plan until 26 . It protects against Medicare fraud . Insurances now have to put 80% of the premiums to the actual care received . Of course , there are potential problems with the < PROPMALE > . But amend , don't repeal . 
There is an AMAZING place in Stillwater that I've never seen/been to before tonight . Tokyo Pot . Delicious . ( 108 W . 10th- in downtown ) 
It's really pathetic that I'm this sore . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , we all knew . But thanks for clarifying . 
T-baggers ?! More like D-baggers ! 
just found out that her favorite burrito at Qdoba has 1,285 calories . Sigh . 
Drill , baby , drill sounds suspiciously a lot like Kill , baby , kill . 
So my cat < PROPFIRST > is apparently a < PROPFIRST > and she's pregnant . 
can't wait for Easter lunch with the Fireys ! 
You give me a Quiet Mind , and I ... I love you . 
wishes it would storm more tonight . Torrential . Downpour . 
broke down and wore an Easter dress today . I'm six . 
lost 6 lbs . in 2 weeks ! Woo ! 
Why'd you sing Hallelujah if it means nothing to ya ? 
Heads up to SODA members and friends : But I'm a Cheerleader , Thursday night- April 8th . 7pm in the French Lounge ! 
Arachibutyrophobia is fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth . You're welcome . 
Today's word is : hugger-mugger . It means secret . It also has a secondary definition of muddled or disorderly . 
Attention world : < PROPFIRST > Swift is a no-talent hack . That is all . 
Today , a two-year-old at work told me that there were dinosaurs on < PROPMALE>'s Ark ; a statement to which I agreed . 
remembers the good old days when Facebook didn't glitch every time I clicked something . 
Replacement snail naming contest ... Go . 
has so much to do : write up a huge Secondary Instrumental Methods project , write a diversity paper for Special Education , practice my butt off and solidify my piano memory , finish two Firth Etudes , pass a singing quiz that means the difference between and A or B for me , rewrite and edit my Music History Research paper , coordinate the drag < PROPMALE > for Dragonfly , and oh yeah ... study for and PASS the Theory Barrier Exam . 
Yet again , for the billionth time , I want Smoothie < PROPMALE > . And gaze longingly at the place where it used to be ... 
Would anyone be willing to < PROPMALE > a litter of kittens for a month or so ? There are two litters : a Siamese with 5 babies and a Torti Tabby with 7 babies . PLEASE HELP ! They really need it ! 
OMG Glee just got even better . Idina Menzel ! 
< PROPFEMALE > just WON Dragonfly 2010 !!! 
IS LIVID THAT SHE MISSED DAY OF SILENCE ! 
just found out that she's been spelling the word \canceled\ " wrong . For her entire life . " 
is extremely satisfied with her most recent iTunes purchase . Thanks , Swell Season , for being just that good . 
The world would be a much better place if everyone just drove the speed limit . 
Whoever told Ke$ha she was talented ... lied . 
passed the barrier ! Oh , and three weeks left of sophomore year ! 
hates when people say , WE are pregnant . 
Surrounded by pimples , ill-fitting clothing , awkwardness that surpasses all , greasy hair , and way too much eyeliner , I am thankful to beout of high school . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , you are wonderful . I will watch you every night , religiously . Thank you for being the only voice of reason on political television . 
Gay prom is cancelled . :( 
has now lost 8lbs . :) 
< PROPFIRST > just cooked pork chops , mashed potatoes , green beans , and rolls for dinner . And of course , sweet tea . Finish it off with an old < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > movie . Life is wonderful . 
wishes people showed respect for animals , i.e. , the crazy old man who told her today that he was going to shoot a litter of puppies on his land , rather than call animal welfare . 
really really really really really does not want to go to Symphonic Band dress rehearsal . 
Ok , 2 projects , 5 finals , 2 take-home finals , and 2 juries . Now for the home stretch ... 
wants to know why Facebook is always so super glitchy now . 
Here's a good way to freak yourself out : realizing that you just accidently overdosed on Excedrin . 
To do list for tomorrow : Study for HUGE Music History final that I know nothing about , practice for piano jury on Monday , compile a low brass notebook , and start/finish a take-home final for low brass . Possibly sleep , but probably not . 
is not prepared for this week . 
hasn't seen Precious , but thought that Gabourey Sidibe could act ( what with all the hubbub ) . I just watched last week's SNL ... man was I wrong . 
wishes she was awesome enough to be < PROPFEMALE > Spektor's best friend . 
Methods project , methods take-home final , PERCUSSION JURY , special < PROPMALE > final , and music theory final left . Not terrible , but ready to be finish < PROPMALE > . 
hates it when Lost kills off her favorite characters . 
Percussion jury is OVER . 
6 finals , 2 juries down . 1 more final to go ! 
is officially a < PROPMALE > . Adulthood , here I come . 
Back in Tulsa for a week . Let me know if you want to < PROPFEMALE > out ! 
thinks anyone who drops off animals on the side of the road should be dropped off on the side of the earth . 
My mother just texted me ROFL . 
Um , tornado status . 
thinks that you probably shouldn't have 19 children if you want all of your children to come out healthy . 
has a feeling she's going to blow a good chunk out of her paycheck at Mayfest . Sigh . It's not like I owe $400 to my parents or anything ... 
got another awesome haircut from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
Why did no one inform me that Begin to Hope had a Bonus Track version with SEVEN MORE SONGS on it ?! I feel robbed ! 
was a little disappointed by Mayfest . Neither of her favorite artists returned , and one of the photographers she really liked was selling an 8x11 PRINT for 150 . 150 . Are you kidding ? 
Dear general public : an apostrophe indicates possession . Not pluralism . 
Attention Stillwater : Please let me know if you want some cheap furniture . < PROPFEMALE > medication is expensive !

Anyone who can help me move furniture on Tuesday or Wednesday next week , please let me know ! 
Word of the day : Veridical : Truthful ; veracious . From my Ethics class . :) 
tornado status ... Again . Sheltering in the Seretean basement with < PROPFIRST > and the kitties . Thank God for practice room keys . 
learned how to ride a bike ! ( Yes , I had a very depressing childhood ... ) 
can't wait to finally move this week ! 
If anyone in Stillwater can help today : I'm moving from my apartment to one about a block away and could really use some extra hands ! Give me a call ! 
Moving sucks . You never really realize how much crap you've acquired when you have to pack it all away , take it down the stairs of your second story apartment , pack it into a Scion which was not meant to be packed , take it up to your new second story apartment , and place it just so . Rinse , wash , and repeat . 
Thanks to < PROPFIRST > Aery , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Firey for helping me move yesterday ! 
Best Glee EVER . And not just because I'm getting a future < PROPFEMALE > cast member named after me . 
Saved two baby kittens who were abandoned in a parking lot . Please let me know if you may have room for them in your home ! They will need shots , of course ! 
is so thankful she found a home for the kittens so quickly ! Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Renk and < PROPFIRST > Rudasill , Bosie and < PROPMALE > now have a family ! 
Sometimes I go to WalMart and people-watch to make me feel good about myself . 
Done with Ethics , now onto math for the first time in three years . This should be good . 
is super excited for Pride tomorrow ! 
What's better than passing out from heat exhaustion ? Not passing out from heat exhaustion . 
Feels really accomplished that she installed and configured her wireless router all by herself . I'm such a grown-up . Now time for cookies , milk , and cartoons . 
Loooves summer in Stilly . Three hour nap in the middle of the day ? Yes , please . 
Just reminding everyone that the location of my birthday party has changed to Tei Kei's on Utica ! Same time , same date ! 
I just got a brand new , sizzling crimson Scion xB 2011 . Holy cow . 
Rang in her birthday at midnight with one of her favorite people , < PROPFIRST > Hendrix . Now time to go to work at 7:30 and let my phone explode with birthday Facebook notifications . 
Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes ! 
has resorted to getting ALL of her news from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
STATUS ! 
Um , so ... Toy Story 3 was AMAZING . 
thinks it's a cruel joke the turtles were created so slow and with such an affinity for crossing the road . 
Happy Birthday to the BEST SISTER EVER ! < PROPFEMALE > Wallis ! 
Profound Status . 
Never realized < PROPMALE > Saget was so vulgar . 
got a < PROPMALE > Snow painting today as a late birthday present from Mom . LOVES IT . Evidently I now have enough to be considered a collector . Which makes me sound obsessed and/or uppity . 
Hulu now has MST3K . YES . 
<3 Mr. Holland's Opus . 
just saw The Last Airbender . Good news for The Happening , it is now no longer the worst M . Night Shyamalan movie ever made . 
Finished with my EPSY Case Study . Now off to some festivities with < PROPFIRST > ! 
Nearly got her car blown up by the crazy ghetto people downtown who were throwing < PROPMALE > candles at the cars who were in gridlock traffic due to a police detour . I understand the cycle of poverty and all that tragedy , but ghetto people are nuts . 
finished helping < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > move into his new apartment , now for some online homework ... Yay ... 
I like Lady in the Water . So < PROPFEMALE > me . 
Quote from < PROPFIRST > at work , \It's slower than a < PROPFEMALE > Palin brain cell race in here . \ " This is why I love him . " 
Apparently you have to be a gangster hamster to buy a < PROPFEMALE > soul . 
Can anyone instruct me on how to use a charcoal grill ? 
got the COOLEST ring ever at Stillwater's Antique Mall . You can't beat 6 bucks . 
About to grill a couple steaks ... Here goes nothing ... 
Suggestions on charcoal type ? < PROPMALE > Oak is not cutting it . 
Oklahoma has now officially moved to 50th in the nation for teacher's salary . Of course , we are also 1st in the nation for teacher qualifications . So basically , we want extremely qualified teachers to work for nothing . Good job , Oklahoma . 
Oh my god . Inception was SO GOOD . Blow your mind good . Speechless good . Absolutely beautiful . Hands down , one of the best movies I've ever seen . 
really loves when her online EPSY professor completely changes her grading system halfway through the semester and doesn't tell anyone about it . Lovely . 
has lost 21 lbs ! Woo ! 
is so unimaginably content with her life . 
It is so hot . Unbelievably hot . I want to jump into a pool of Iced Tea . 
went to the Humane Society today . I wish I had a dog . :( 
Thanks Cavies ' 10 , for being that good . 
THIS . IS . MY RIFLE . 
People who swerve to HIT animals in the road are morally disgusting . Dear little country turtle , < PROPFEMALE > will come back to that stupid , < PROPMALE > redneck . 
is seriously considering auditioning for the one , the only , Bluecoats pit . It's been my dream since I was 14 . Let's see if we can make it a reality . 
All I ask is that < PROPFIRST > Fallin and < PROPFIRST > Sullivan don't win . That's not too much , right ? 
Who wants to come with me today and play with puppies at the Stillwater Humane Society ?! 
had a good time at the lake with Shelter dog Kela ! It was sooo hot , and she's nuts , but what a sweetheart ! 
after a seven-page paper completed in one sitting on the importance of comprehensive sex education in public schools , is FINALLY done with EPSY . 
is needing some new iTunes . Any suggestions ? I usually run along the lines of my favs , < PROPFEMALE > Spektor , < PROPFIRST > Bird , Pomplamoose , Feist , Swell Season , The Hush Sound , and Mars Volta . 
Love is a many splendored thing . Love lifts us up where we belong . All you need is love ! 
has lost almost 30 lbs . Yaaaaaay . 
basically lives in an attic , so her AC is about to kill itself just trying to maintain under 80 . Thanks , Oklahoma . 
Feelin ' the pull ... dragging me off again . And I'm feelin ' so small ... against that big sky tonight . 
is excited to start teching Cushing's percussion tomorrow ! 
Prop 8 is dead ! 
Hopefully tomorrow will be a better teaching day ... Bass drums are just as cool as everything else in the line . 
Trimming the fat on her iTunes . Sigh of relief . 
I didn't go to see the city , I went to see it around you . We can laugh in hell together , the devil will find you too . 
is a silly little twelve-year-old girl whose dreams far exceed the realms of her reality . 
has rediscovered her love for The Mars Volta . 
Anyone want a black lab puppy ? I found one today in cushing , very socialized and people-oriented . I can bring her back today ! 9186453786 ! 
is decidedly not ready for a dog in her life . I think I may have become a cat person ... Dear God . 
wishes all of her drum corps family luck tonight and tomorrow night ! I miss you all ! 
is ready to start year three of her college adventure . 
D-d-d-d DATE NIGHT . 
vehemently liked < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World . 
is bonding with her new CMB pit . :) 
So a car got pulled over outside my apartment by a Stillwater cop . After a few minutes , he must've decided he needed backup , cue incognito Ford Explorer cop . They've been out there for about twenty minutes , just standing around and looking at the poor guy's old car , all the while their lights on making a big fuss . I'm pretty certain it's just that his tail light is out . That's it . Douches . 
I had a dream that a volcano was growing on my face . I woke up to find the biggest zit ever on my < PROPFEMALE > . I think I'm a prophet . And ... that sucks . 
School in t minus 7 hours ... 
Scruffy puppy naming contest . Male , about twenty pounds when full grown , sweet , quiet , laid back . I like real people names . :) 
Ok , it's between < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > . 
His name is < PROPMALE > . My sister's vote kind of trumps all . 
It has now become a requirement that to be my friend , you must meet and love my new puppy . You're welcome . 
Please help ! If you know much about housebreaking a dog , call/text/email/fb comment me ! 
Oh , hey wind ensemble audition . Restart three times , forget two accidentals , barf all over your timpani tuning , get your rhythms verbally corrected during the audition , and have your snare be virtually unintelligible . That's right , I'm a musician . (...) 
took < PROPMALE > to the groomer , got him a harness and another toy . While the groomer definitely wasn't his favorite thing , he sure feels better after and looks great ! ( The puppy bandana helps ! ) 
got the parent's OK on < PROPMALE > last night . Whew . His personality is really starting to shine through . Leash training is coming along , housebreaking ... is another story . 
< PROPMALE > is housebroken ! Muahaha ! 
is looking for anyone in Stillwater with a dog/puppy they may want to socialize with mine on playdates ? MUST be neutered , UTD on shots , flea/tick/heartworm preventative , dewormed , and non-aggressive . Let me know ! 
Oh hey , 19 hours of class . Aren't you lovely . 
wants the seasons to change NOW . 
is not a very good percussionist . 
was looking forward to tonight all week to take < PROPMALE > to the one-night-a-week dog park on campus . Cue torrential rainstorm . Thanks , God . 
<3 this weather . 
Stillwater has awoken . 
got to go to the Suite/Club level of the stadium , get a ton of free food , and see where T Boone watches his games . Muahaha . 
< PROPMALE > Matthews Band , 41 . This one goes out to you , SDUB 150 . 
LOVES when she practices her flute like crazy and can play everything perfectly , and then the next morning , BARFS ALL OVER her playing test . It's really awesome . 
< PROPMALE > destroyed his first pair of my shoes today . 
Last night , I had a dream that the president suddenly decided to segregate men and women so that only men knew important news and women were kept in oblivion . I then , of course , organized a feminist revolution and liberated all of the women into equality , after having a serious hear t-t o-heart with Mr. Obama . 
< PROPMALE > chewed through his second pair of my shoes last night . Good thing he's going for the cheap uncomfortable ones that don't really fit . 
loves her some < PROPFIRST > Copeland . 
Parenthood season premier tonight ! 
Favorite episode of Glee is on : Gaga . LOVE < PROPFIRST > O'Malley's monologue and Naya Rivera's Bad Romance . <3 
Sold all of her childhood books for 16 bucks . Then spent nearly 90 on weekly groceries . Economy FAIL . 
The O'Colly had three spelling/grammatical errors in today's paper alone . I've decided they've just really stopped caring ... 
just came back from Devil . I give it a solid B+ . Fairly ( really ) predictable , but overall a good , mildly scary flick . Definitely a redemption from Airbender . 
Worst . Day . Ever . Woke up at 5:30 to drive into work in Tulsa after a night game in Stillwater , EVERY child at the nursery was pissed off and screaming bloody murder , had to drive back to Stillwater to study for a HUGE exam tomorrow morning and most importantly , my family dog that we've had for 13 years is dying . Someone shoot me . 
Music History makes me HATE music . 
DADT vote today . MERKA . 
Going to Washington DC Thurs-Mon . Hit me up with some must-sees while I'm there ! 
misses < PROPFIRST > Firey .

We just walked by a black panther ralley outside the metro . 
Loves me some Advocates for Youth ! 
has ants in her bed . 
has to have surgery tomorrow . 
< PROPMALE > sprained his foot . By looking at a table . 
Surgery went pretty well . They found some mild abnormalities , so had to get xrays . Hope the results come in soon ! 
is currently sitting in the tunnel of the Boone Pickens stadium , A&M game blaring outside , trying desperately to write a research proposal . Anyone know any good articles on Ravel's ciphers ? 
Everyone needs to come to the SUAB dog show tonight and root for < PROPMALE > ! He's definitely the cutest one out there ! 6pm on Library Lawn ! 
< PROPMALE > WON the dog fashion show ! I really do have Stillwater's cutest dog ! 
Can't wait to see all of Tulsa's finest at THE FAIR tonight . 
Just listened to Palladino's interview on NPR . Dear New York , please , for your sake , don't elect this crazy idiot . 
Happy Birthday to the most wonderful person I know , < PROPFIRST > Firey . I love you . 
What's the difference between rounded binary and anything ternary ? 
Computer's about to die ... Boo . Now I have nothing to do in Music History .

Today is National Coming Out Day . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and only five states plus DC recognize that love , not gender , is what matters in a marriage .

Did anyone else feel that earthquake ? 
FYI : My phone is dead and won't be working until Sunday . If you need to reach me , call < PROPFIRST > . 
Loves when 6 hours of practicing yields absolutely nothing . Oh and FYI : I don't like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s music . So < PROPFEMALE > me . 
So . Tired . Now on to finishing a Pyware tutorial ( just kill me now ) and Form and Analysis HW . :( 
< PROPMALE > had a GREAT time at RosePetCottage this weekend while I was away with the band ! Consider taking your pets there when you go out of town ! 
Pyware can die . 
Hopes to see everyone at the OSU Percussion Ensemble Concert tomorrow night at 8 ! 
< PROPMALE > ate a candle . ( And a roll of Scotch tape . And pieces of < PROPFIRST>'s shoe . And any bug who dare set its foot in the apartment . ) 
Sister ... Wives . Really , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Well . That was disappointing . 
had a dream that dead people were brought back to life . The dead people were so pissed about the whole thing that they all immediately and violently killed themselves ( again ) because they didn't want to be with the living . Hmm , subconscious ... 
Just got back from Paranormal Activity 2 . Not nearly as scary/innovative/cool as the first one ... Boo . C+ . 
Hopes to see everyone tonight at Take Back the Night : A protest against sexual violence ! 7pm in the Sequoyah Room in the Union ! ( Bring a jacket ! ) 
Had quite the little activist day with Out on the Lawn and Take Back the Night ! Now time to butcher some beginning flute ...

550 days , 2 hours , and 28 seconds until I graduate . UGH school . 
America/Oklahoma FAIL . 
Oh , hey 102.3 fever . How you doin . 
Just heard an interesting tidbit , by outlawing international law in Oklahoma , we may have also outlawed using the Ten Commandments as lawful backing . Bahaha , take that , Oklahoma ! 
< PROPMALE > at a gluestick . Thankfully , it was the kid-friendly non-toxic kind . Ugh . 
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo . 
I was gone for less than an hour and < PROPMALE > destroyed my sunglasses . Sigh . 
Oh , What Not to Wear . How blessed you make me feel not to be so socially inept . 
And ... go Pokes . :) 
No , it is NOT too early to decorate for Christmas . Especially because I'll only be in Stilly half of December . Apartment CHRISTMATIZED . 
Hey school , could you stop making me want to throw myself off the Seretean ? Mondays suck enough as it is . \ 
Kthanks , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Any vocalists ' remedies on a sore throat ? I have to sing tomorrow :(

wouldn't mine loosing to the Sooners so much if they weren't such douchebags . 
is finally finished Christmas decorating . I really do have a somewhat unhealthy obsession with Christmas(time ) . 
Hey , worst day ever . How you doin . 
had one of the better performances of her playing career so far . 
is hospitalized with most likely E Coli . I've never been this sick in my life . 
My tests came back and it looks like it's viral rather than bacterial . And extraordinarily contagious . My mom spent less than a day with me and she's extremely sick . I'm glad to be out of the ER , though . Now I'm on no less than twenty pills a day ( we had to write out a schedule ) . Goodbye , world , back to my bed . 
< PROPMALE > hid a chewed up Christmas ornament under the rug . You can't fool my vaccuum , little dog . 
< PROPMALE > just learned how to shake in under 2 minutes . I have the smartest dog EVER . Now if he would only learn some manners ... 
Tulsa was on the Daily Show ! For its silliness . 
Would like to thank the OSU Parking & Transit Service Nazis for giving her an overtime ticket even though she moved her car to a different spot and wasn't parked there over 30 minutes . 
DIE PYWARE DIE . 
loves everyone's Finals Week Status Freakouts . 
Halfway done . Flute Final , Sonata Project , Piano Jury , check . Now onto the hard part : Percussion Jury , Form Take-Home Final , and Form In-Class Final . BOO . 
\I have a problem with people who take the Constitution loosely and the Bible literally . \ " - < PROPMALE > Maher " 
got a V on her jury ! 
is pretty sure she has strep . Really , immune system ? Stomach flu and strep in three weeks ?! 
has a sinus virus . Fun to rhyme , not to get . I think my body has a personal vendetta against me . 
Come on DADT repeal ! 3pm Eastern TODAY ! History in the making ! 
Don't Ask Don't Tell is OFFICIALLY REPEALED ! 
Black Swan was INCREDIBLE .

Go Pokes . 
I came downstairs today to find < PROPMALE>'s 3-week-old bed completely destroyed , stuffing everywhere . Sigh . Back to Petco and < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to him AGAIN . 
wasn't aware that the plural of \panini\ " is \ " panini\ " . I want five panini . " 
Dear world : If you keep your pets outside , provide them with adequate shelter . If you don't feel like doing that , just bring them in . Their lives are more important than your carpet . Kthanks . 
Summer Glau's career : Oh , that girl who kinda looks like < PROPFEMALE > Wilde and who just isn't as good .

Dear percussionist friends : please comment with some of your favorite marimba literature , around grade 5 . Thanks !

Thank you to all the lovely women who auditioned for the Vagina Monologues tonight !. 2nd audition is Thursday , 6-8 in CLB 101 ! 
< PROPMALE > just chewed THROUGH a toy a got him less than an hour ago MADE OUT OF FIREMAN'S HOSE . Sorry for the caps , but it seems ridiculous . 
Beta naming contest ! 
The Vagina Monologues 2011 is fully casted ! On a side note , does anyone know where I can get some good hummus in Stilly ? 
T . Boone's on The Daily Show ! 
Loves hardcore working out and dieting her butt off to GAIN half a pound . Thanks , body . Screw you , too . 
My betta's name is < PROPFIRST > and he refuses to eat . :( 
Uhh ... did Stillwater not get the snow memo ? 
Somehow , snow got through the < PROPFEMALE > crack in my door and left a two-inch pile in my entry . Did I mention I live on the second floor ? 
< PROPMALE > takes \frolicking in the snow\ " to a whole new level . " 
If you wouldn't mind , stop by Mead Jewelers < PROPFEMALE > and \like\ " my picture posted on their wall . Please and thank you . :) " 
just heard gunshots outside ... Uhh ... 
hates the clarinet . I hate the sound , I hate how it has a ridiculous amount of buttons , I hate how reeds get disgusting . I apologize in advance . 
Seriously , OSU ? It's great that you shoveled your sidewalks like robo-giants , but it won't matter if I can't actually GET to your sidewalk in the first place . 
Evidently it's colder in Oklahoma than in the South Pole . 
spent about $650 today ... Ugh . At least I'm signed up for OSAT/OPTE , paid for my gym , bought a custom baton , and my weight in percussion literature . 
gave < PROPMALE > his first bath since the snow came last week ... he was pissed . 
And a Happy < PROPFIRST>'s to you , parking officer . May your eternal loneliness never cease to fuel your bitter , relentless work ethic . 
will no longer have her childhood house in Bixby or parents who live in Oklahoma by Tuesday . Ugh , adulthood . 
Does anyone know of a tailor in Stillwater ? 
Today is National Spay and Neuter Day ! The world doesn't need more puppies . Be a responsible pet owner and have your dog or cat fixed . \ 
\ 
For those concerned with the cost , Spay Oklahoma does spays and neuters for families making $ 40,000 or less for under $50 . 
< PROPMALE > weighs nearly 40lbs ... So much for the \20 max\ " that I was originally quoted ... " 
Now taking book recommendations ... 
Ordered a custom graphite baton over 2 weeks ago , thinking I'd have it in time for my advanced conducting final . Nope . Mail fail . 
< PROPMALE > went with me to Vagina Monologues rehearsal tonight . Vagina Warriors come in all shapes and sizes . 
Just saw a picture of me in Southwind ... four years and like thirty pounds ago . SIGH . 
doesn't understand why she has to get a new sickness every 2 and a half months . Screw you too , immune system .
