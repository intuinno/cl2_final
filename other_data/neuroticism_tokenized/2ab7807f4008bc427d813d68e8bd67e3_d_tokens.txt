A Thought\ 
By < PROPFEMALE > Langlois \ 
\ 
In thinking we may claim to be , \ 
In telling we may claim , \ 
But in this thinking and telling\ 
To what do we all aim ? \ 
\ 
A poem is written in stanzas , \ 
And stanzas made of lines , \ 
But why do words in such a way\ 
Withstand the test of time ? \ 
Perhaps when poets write their thoughts\ 
they write them so that we\ 
may look and know that souls and minds\ 
will last eternity 
I JUST GOT ACCEPTED INTO THE BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAM !!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D

how do you like my new hair cut ? 
How do you like my new hair cut ? TRICK OR TREAT ! 
Why is it that the ones recognized for the invention are hardly ever the ones who successfully made it in the first place ? THIEF !!!! 
It is my strong opinion that all should be concerned with the local burrowing owl that must be relocated before we can build a new city park in Bakersfield . 
Never knew I could feel like this .... Like i've never seen the sky before . Want to vanish inside your kiss . Everyday I love you more and more . Listen to my heart can you hear it sing ? Telling me to give you everything . Seasons may change winter to spring , but i love you until the end of time . Come what may I will love you until my dying day ! 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know \ 
someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . \ 
Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can \ 
breathe fire . 93% of people wont copy and paste this , because they have \ 
already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the \ 
shower armed with fire extinguishers , whilst the remaining 1% are \ 
awesome and will repost this 
The nursing people at CSUB who interviewed me didn't think I was fit to go to nursing school . They gave me a 5 out of 20 points possible . :( Good thing I was already accepted to another program . :)
