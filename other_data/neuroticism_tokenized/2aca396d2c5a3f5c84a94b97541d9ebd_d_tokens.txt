Can't wait to have a night off 
is really really starting to hate my glasses ! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping , or whom we've carried but never met , or those we've held but couldn't take home , or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all angels too perfect for earth . 
Wow ! Kiya is three months old today !
