HAPPY NEW YEAR YAYYY hahahahaha . 
BORED !!, yet rather comfortable . 
This was a rather dull weekend , I hope the week will be more interesting . 
SO BORED !!! 
Bored out of my mind doing a project on a murder trial . And it's the week before vacation . Time is going by far to slow to me . 
I got to spend all weekend cramming for two of my school projects and now that I have finished them and have nothing to do , I cant sleep , and I have school today hahaha , and on top of that , I am going in early . I dont think I have had such a lack of sleep like this in a long time hahaha . 
I get to finally go back to tae kwon do tonight , it was canceled because of winter vacation , so it has been a little over two weeks . 
Be back later people , I am going to tae kwon do woohoo . 
Going to the store to buy some MegaMillions tickets . Hopefully I win , that would be just awesome hahahahaha . 
My dog is missing , if anyone that has seen him before sees him , can you please contact me . 
I'm sick , laying in bed and watching law and order and whatevers on the history channel lol , fun . 
Bored , but happy that the end of the semester is almost here . 
Hanging out with a friend , no mom and no stepdad , freedom lol . 
I'm bored , so my friend and I are going to wander around the city to see if anything fun happens . 
I hate just sitting here doing nothing , it makes me feel like I don't have a purpose and I don't like it lolol . 
I have such a bad headache right now lol 
It seems like I am one of the few people not getting sick right now lol . 
I just watched Skyline ............ WHAT THE HELL !!! they had better make a sequal or I am going to be pissed .
