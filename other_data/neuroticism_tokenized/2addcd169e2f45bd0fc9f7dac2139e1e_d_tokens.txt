Preparing a lecture for Seminar at NW Championships in Seattle , Sunday at 8:30 AM . Sounds exciting , but starts too early , everyone will be asleep on my lecture :) I hope some people still come . 
sleepless night updating website . Will I survive eight hours of teaching today ?! 
Mineral water hot springs and massage on Sunday are the best treats after today's hell(oween tricks :) 
I slept through my Amer . History class :( ... but it is so good to sleep with a rain music drumming at a window . I love Portland :) 
Crazy time : packing for Bassano , squeezing 24 lessons in three days , finishing judging gown , homework in Italien , writing an IDSF report , and , maybe , getting a cute haircut ... Fun ! :)
