What a great day on the river ! Got thrown and took a header into an elbow off of a rapid on a fairly tame river . Don't under estimate the power of water ! LOL 
-I might not be the most beautiful or the sexiest girl out there .. Nor do I have the perfect body .. I might not be anyone's first choice but I am a GREAT choice .. I will not pretend to be someone else because I am too good at being ME .. I might not be proud of some of the things I've done but I am proud of who I am today ! Take me as I am or don't take me at all . Copy / Paste if you are happy with you . ? 
today ... could have been a good day . But I layed around in my pajamas and did nothing ... 
I'm feeling like such a negative < PROPFEMALE >

What the heck ? It's river time not pneumonia time !!! What is with this rainy and chilly weather ?? GRRR 
Today was way less rad than I expected ... And now I'm not goin to the concert .... lame .... 
Oh man . There is now female viagra .. This probably isn't that new of a thing . But the first I've heard ... 
Why am I so sore ?? 
I ate a ZOMBIE !!! 
I guess it's the time of day where I get bored and drive around 
I just saw a rainbow !! Waiting to hear if I'll be on the river for 5 days or 1 .. I wonder what this could possibly mean !! 
If your love is strong , thats all you need ! 
Chillin like flint 
Don't drink and drive . Smoke and fly ! ( What is your view on proposed Measure 8 ?? ) 
Wild friday night for me , I'm gunna sit in my room and play the Wii !

So stay with me and I'll have it made . And I don't understand why I sleep all day . And I start to complain that there's no rain . And all I can do is read a book to stay awake . And it rips my life away , but it's a great escape . \

I'm half alive , but I feel mostly dead . 
EMT-Basic starts in January . There are going to be so many hoops to jump through , but I know its worth it . I need to focus on the task at hand and remember what I truely want for my life . And right now . I want to get back into a work routine and complete the class !

Wake up you silly sleepy head , sniff reality and not meth . Wake up from your silly delusion . Sleepy head , and while your at it wake up , learn how to spell and use proper grammer dumbshit ! ( You may use improper punctuation if you like , but only because I am allowing you to do so . Because I do it too sleepy head ) 
Everything is so confusing , why must we strive to make sense of this unsure reality ? So many factors and variables . Life in arithmetic . Come closer , stay away ! Suffer , take medication . Work , fail to succeed . My life is so unsure right now and filled negativity with every choice I make . STRESSED . I want something concrete and sure , but then again .. I don't . 
I need a new swear word that combines all meanings of every swear word known to human kind . And then the meaning needs to be 1,000,000 X more intense and worse than any other before .

Or something . Fuck it . 
My horoscopes have been right on the money latetly . Just thought you needed to know that . It makes me feel good . I must remain positive and count my blessings . And not be such a stubborn Scorpio . :)

So , has anyone heard about Grace < PROPFEMALE > Schröeder getting a sex change after she gives birth to her son ? Keep it on the D.L. You didn't hear it from me . ;)

Today's grocery list : Green veggies and delicious fruits . Also a trip to the Thurston Book Exchange . Favorite bookstore EVER ! 
So , I just watched Signs and it never gets less scary , so here I am juicing < PROPFEMALE > choy , parsley , kale , red cabbage and carrots in my bathroom so I don't disturb my family . :\\ Ya the laptop is in the bathroom too .

Our beloved Hills Creek Dam was featured in a 2008 episode of Mega Disasters on the History channel . Not that it was a disaster , that it could be . OOOOO . I watched it last night . Thought it was pretty neat . Or is it just old news and I'm the last know haha . 
When I grow up I want to be chupacabra ..

I think it might be the appropriate time to panic , because the government is saying everything will be alright . I really don't want incurable bone cancer . But then again it makes sense that radiation particles would be very diluted .. Hmmm . Won't catch me eating iodine tablets just yet . 
Pear pear pear pear ladies ! 
Wanna know the truth ? Like this and I'll tell you what I think . 
I kinda feel bad . No matter what , when I have to step up and continue my service as a great friend I always lose . And mostly I lose opportunities . Seems like its happened again . :( 
Wow . I had contact with the sex offender at large in < PROPFIRST > today ! Just saw it on the news . A creeper talked to me on the bike path and hovered around for awhile . Then I joked with my sister about him looking like the suspect . He was found by police about a quarter mile away 2 hours after I saw him !! GAH I thought there was no way it was him . Theres a reason why I don't like strolling in town ..
