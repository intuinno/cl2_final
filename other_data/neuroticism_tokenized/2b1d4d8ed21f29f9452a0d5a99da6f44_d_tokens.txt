It rained last night ... it's nice and cool outside ... just those few things can make me pretty happy . ^_^ 
I'm so happy right now . It's raining pretty hard . It makes me miss Scotland , but also fills me with it's pleasant memories ...

This year has so far been a rather depressing and lame year . Here's to change ! 
Burgers , turkey bacon and a side of ham . 
Nothin ' like some good old Pokemon shows on a beautiful cloudy day . 
I hate being so sad and unable to cry it out . My emotions are broken . =/

The more I understand the deep meanings in Rammstein's music , the more I come to appreciate them . I wish I could have gone to their last concert ... =( 
I don't know I can last a whole year , the anticipation ( of the < PROPFEMALE > Wars MMO ) is driving me insane . 
A part of me has died inside . By not going to E3 , I missed a < PROPMALE > to play and see a game a full year before it's release . A game I am obsessing over . * sobs * 
I really hate Summer ... stupid heat ! 
Blargh ! 
* sigh * I need some better pictures of me . None of the current ones are ones I'm willing to use for my profile pic ... 
Mytouch slide is awesome ! 
English is hard

Jumping on the < PROPFEMALE > is important . 
Hydrocodone , you saved me . <3 
I didn't realize so many people are Exemptionalists ...

I got an A in English ! Woot ! 
* Sigh * ... 
I'm feeling good about school . Got a game plan set up for my AA and everything . 
I hope I get called back soon ... I really want a job . 
Why are some people just unwilling to make friends ? I don't even have to < PROPFEMALE > out with them ... I miss the friendliness of Kansas . California is full of fucks . >=/ 
SC2 Beta ends on the 19th ... damn . 
One more week left ! I've been waiting over 10 years for the release of SC2 ... I'm so excited ! 
“To be humble to superiors is duty , to equals is courtesy , to inferiors is nobility . ” - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE >

Shittiest day I've had in a long time ... and it just won't stop . Fuck . 
Sleeping is hard ... 
\The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt . \ " -Bertrand < PROPFIRST > " 
Sun Chips are no longer compostable because they are too noisy ... wtf . There is even a fucking Facebook < PROPFEMALE > devoted to it . Bunch of boobs can't handle noisy GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT packages ? So , you prefer the SIT THE THE DIRT FOR DECADES non-noisy bags ? And I wonder why the progress towards a better world is taking so damn long ...

Watch it and learn what you didn't know about the MPAA . 
I never understood why we couldn't meet a simple negotiation\ 
with the gay marriage issue . Marriage should be enjoyed by all , gay or\ 
straight . My idea was to allow marriage to be open for all , but have it so that\ 
religious institutions were exempt from having to abide from the law ( seeing as\ 
they are not a government establishment and they would go against the\ 
separation of church and state ) . * sigh * 
KC Masterpiece . The best . 
Facebook needs skins ... at the very least , something that isn't white . 
If you give more warning with your brake lights than you do with your blinker , you're doing it wrong . 
I'm super happy about our victory with DADT , now we just need to correct a certain marriage issue and I think we'll be on a really great start . 
Talking to some friends about how STO has gone down in price so much , due to it sucking ... and one of them says , \I can depreciate that . \"" 
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours , but I think that God's got a sick sense of humour . And when I die I expect to see Him laughing . 
Readying my computer for Win7 64-bit . I'm excited . XD 
Hot caramel chocolate milk . Yum . 
Just watched a few episodes on Infested , a show about bugs/pests like scorpions , rats and bedbugs . Though I found it quite interesting and learned some things , I've become quite itchy . =( 
I love < PROPMALE > Gervais . 
Just cleaned and reorganized my room . Started at 3pm and finished at 12am . Phew ... Well , not finished exactly , but to the point of being able to stop . I'm exhausted . 
Nice job NatGeo , I see what you're doing . I'm saddened by your lack of unbias in your shows . You're now on the same par with History Channel and their ghost stories . 
< PROPFIRST > Carlin , I miss your logical critcism and anti-BS rants ... you old fuck .
