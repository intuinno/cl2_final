So many changes over the summer , but I'm looking forward to a great year . Sophomore year ..... here we go ! 
I'm exhausted and a little bit red from band camp . Can't believe we have to get up and do it all over again in 12 1/2 hours . But sleep and shopping on Sunday . Whoo-hoo ! 
Sunburnt from band camp .... but that won't stop me from shopping in Fairview Heights tomorrow ! 
Had a great day shopping , band camp at 1 p.m. tomorrow . Definitely bringing sunscreen .
