May survive after all . Cannot believe how much better I feel than yesterday . Hope this weather doesn't delay any flights tomorrow . 

Happy to be home ! Almost back to 100% . Put away Christmas lights and ornaments . Could use one more day before returning to work . Oh well . Sure enjoyed visiting with everyone . 
At this rate schools won't be out until July ! Although it is really nice to be looking out on this cold blowing snow instead of being out in it I hope it clears fast . 
It has turned out to be such a beautiful day . When the wind dies down you can even do with just a fleece or heavy sweater . Hard to stay home but the roads are really really really awful and quite dangerous still . Good thing everybody ( schools and government ) are shut down to keep down the traffic . 
Wish they would stay shut down one more day so that the plows could get more of the roads open . Tomorrow's commute will be pretty awful I am sure . 
Brrrrr ! 18 degrees outside .... single digits close by .... more snow coming at midday ... what a day to look forward to ! 
Well , < PROPFIRST > had his eyes fixed ( Lasek ) this afternoon . Hope it comes out perfect as he hopes . It took only a half hour and then they sent him home to go to bed with protective goggles . We will see how he feels when we awaken him for dinner . By then he should be able to see a big difference in his vision ... he hopes ... we hope too . Seems like magic that they can do things like this now ! 
Had a positively wonderful time at < PROPFEMALE > Carpenter's 3rd birthday party . Mama ( < PROPFEMALE > ) threw her a positively terrific party with lots of good food , a gorgeous cake , lots of presents , good company ... doesn't get any better than that ! < PROPFEMALE > had a great time and was a wonderful hostess as well . 
Had a wonderful evening celebrating < PROPFIRST>'s 24th birthday with him , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! Good food , good company , presents and cake ... doesn't get much better ! 
T.G.I.F. Taking Monday off ! 3 days to get caught up ... whooooeeeee ! 
Miserable rainey day all day today ... not an ideal Saturday . Had a good workout at the gym though so that's good . Now on to work on the computers and Turbotax ! 
Looking forward to much better weather this weekend . May actually get to do stuff outside . Time to hit the yard and get ready for summer ! 
Wow ! What a nice day this has been . Got a lot done in the yard ... deleafing ... liming ... fertilizing . Will have a nice Spring when the grass starts growing and the flowers come up . The tulips are already poking up . 
Got a fair amount done this weekend between raking , fertilizing , and liming the yard . Got a PU load of mulch on the front flower bed . Still lots to do but pretty good for one weekend . Just in time since it is supposed to rain Monday . Weekend was so pretty ... almost reached 80 . Even e-filed my taxes ... now all I have to do is write the check and mail it in ... groan . 
Grrrr ! Replaced the Central AC last year ... now they say I need a new furnace . Not a happy outcome ! 
Good news ... Don't need a new furnace after all ... They found the water leak and it can easily be repaired ! Hopefully it will be good for another few years at least ! 
Great weekend ! FCPS Spring Break this next week . Should be good weather if a bit cool . Hope it is warm in Florida ! 
Rain Rain Goaway ... come again next week . Rained all night and will be raining until noon . WDW let me change my Backstage Magic Tour until tomorrow so all is well . Wonder what is on at the movies in Downtown Disney . 
Turned into a beautiful day if a bit cool and breezy after the rain passed . Nice and < PROPFEMALE > ! Should be really nice for our Backstage Magic Tour at WDW tomorrow ! Here is hoping ! 
Backstage Magic was very nice . Two very informative tourguides took through selected areas at EPCOT , MK , Hollywood Studios , Animal Kingdom and some other backstage areas . We watched the parade at Animal Kingdom . Day started off cool but turned out nice . Good day ! 
Another beautiful day at Orange Lake . Got in some pool time ... couple of laps around the lazy river on the blue tubes ... just a relaxing vacation day not at work or worrying about anything much at all . 
Home Again ... aaaaahhhh ! Vacation is nice but it is nice to be home again too . Had a nice breakfast with < PROPFEMALE > and Samantha ... dropped the car off for service ... Beautiful day outside ... lots of sun but not too hat . Nice end to a nice week . 
Looking forward to a very nice , low key weekend ! Weather outside is nice . Got the grass mowed Friday . Nothing urgent needing attention ... just recharge the batteries . 
One more day until Friday , YEAAAAAAAH ! Greatly looking forward to seeing the Marysville Verchots and going to see Knuffle < PROPFEMALE > at the Kennedy Center with the whole family . 
had a terrific day ! We all ( All three kids and spouses , all three grandkids , < PROPFEMALE > and I ) went to see the opening of Mo Willems ' \The Knuffle Bunny\ " at the Kennedy Center . Unexpected bonus ... Mo was there and signed books for the kids as well . Planning a big Mothers ' Day brunch at the Officer's club . It is great to have everyone here ! " 
TGIF ... ready for the weekend for sure . I love my job but the weekends rock ! The yard and flowerbeds are looking great this year . Time to relax and catch up on both sleep and stuff around the house . 
couldn't have asked for a prettier weekend ... only a longer one . Cannot say I got much done but it has been a nice weekend to just enjoy being around the house . 
is thinking that last week was really really great ! I had never previously been to Naples Florida . It is totally awesome . Naple Grande Hotel was fantastic . Great pool , great beach , terrific accomodations ... what's not to like . Great place to have a conference for sure . 
thinks this weekend is shaping up to be a beautiful , summer one . Great for some pool time or just hanging on the deck with a brew and a book . Not sure which yet ... maybe some of both after the errands are run . 
is looking forward to Father's Day tomorrow ! After a nice lunch we plan a relaxing afternoon with < PROPFEMALE > in the sand box and pool . Should be fun , fun , fun ! 
Thinks it is really neat to have a son-in-law and daughter who actually understand these iphones and can get them to work for me :-) 
Great granddaddy set up a tireswing far < PROPFEMALE > that she thinks is great ! yeah ! 
I meant guarded ... I could grow to dislike the spelling suggestion feature 
Is having a busy and pleasant Saturday with all 3 kids and their families home with us . I love having all 3 grandkids here ! A bit loud at times :-) 
Went to see MaryPoppins at the Kennedy Center . It was good but different than I expected since it pulled characters from the book and not just the movie . < PROPFIRST > seemed to like it too ! 
Is having a busy day ... took the leaf vac for service , mowed-lined-fertilized the lawn , worked out at the gym , helped < PROPFEMALE > set up Facebook & Twitter ... amongst other things . 
is getting ready for quick business trip to Huntsville/Decatur next week . 
Roll Tide Roll ! Even with starters missing team loos good . Ready to roll over Penn StateFor sure ! 
Is glad the Alabama-Penn State game will be on ESPN next Saturday because I really prefer watching on the TV versus the smaller computer screen . 
Roll Tide Roll ! Pretty nice win over Penn State . Next week < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > are back so the Tide should be even tougher . Outstanding ! 
Is glad to see < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > back in the game ! Offense is looking really good ! Defense better step up their game if they want to get past the rest of the SEC . Roll Tide Roll ! 
Is pulling for Bama to bring it home in the 4th quarter . Come on Bama , do your thing ! Roll Tide Roll ! 
Is very happy ! 24-20 ! Way to go Bama ! Roll Tide Roll ! All the way Bama ! 
WOW ! That Bama game was incredible . The Defense was AWESOME ! I expected to win but to dominate that totally was extraordinary . 
Thinks that the secondhalf of the Tennessee Game was AWESOME ! < PROPFIRST > played a terrific game . Roll Tide Roll ! 
Cold and Rainy day in Northern VA . I bet the roads will be jammed ... groan ! Oh well ... it is what it is . 
I must be insane ... Up at 430 on a SATURDAY to go hike 11 < PROPMALE > in the Shendadoah with Boy Scouts . It is going to be pretty but it is going to be cold . 
Is bummed that LSU beat the TIDE today . It was a good game , both teams played well , blah , blah , blah but it really is a bummer that the Tide lost ! I hope we can win the rest of them this season . 
Back to the grindstone ! Nice to see daylight in the morning . Will be bummer coming home in the dark . 
Is wishing his commute could be as easy every day . 
Way to go < PROPFIRST > , Rushing leader for the game ! What a day < PROPMALE > had : you were robbed on that TD . Good game for the Tide ! ROLL TIDE ... Let's win the rest ! 
Back from Huntsville , it is going to be a busy weekend cleaning up for Thanksgiving guests . Really looking forward to having everyone here . It is really exciting to have all the kids and grandkids together . Hope everyone has a great time so they will want to come back often . 
Today's the day ... picking up the Ohio Verchot's tonight ! Should be a busy , exciting holiday . Can't wait to see them ! 
Kids are all sleeping in . EVERYONE will be here for breakfast . It was nice playing with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > last night and visiting with < PROPMALE > and April . Gonna be a great weekend ! Roll Tide Roll ! 
I have a lot to be thankful for and many of them are here with me . We are all having a wonderful time with all my kids and their families here with me . Amazing how much energy these three grandkids bring into the house ! 
Grrrrr ! One point !? What on earth happened after the first quarter ? 
I really hate to lose to Auburn but ... I'm hoping that it took the 2011 national champion to beat us . Be nice to keep the title in the SEC even if Bama cannot repeat . 
Just winding down from a terrific thanksgiving holiday with all of our kids and grandkids . Those three sure enjoyed playing with each other ! Hope they are always such good friends ! Just loved spending time with the whole family ! 
Here comes < PROPFEMALE > Clause .... Going to see the Clause family with < PROPFEMALE > this morning . Good start to my Saturday :-) 
Thinks his front yard has a incredible amount of leaves . Two hours of blowing only got them into a huge pile in the side yard . Didn't even start the back ... something to look forward to for tomorrow . 
Darn ! It's tomorrow ! 
had a pretty good weekend ! Brunch with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , got all the leaves blown back into the woods , ordered presents , finished decorating our tree with < PROPFEMALE>'s help , and even got to the gym once . Busy week ahead . 
Interesting start to my Saturday , breakfast with the animals and other friends . 
Nice relaxing weekend ! < PROPFEMALE > spent the night so we got up and had pancakes before breakfast and Cherub Choir practice . A very pleasant way to start our Sunday ! 
has lots to do this last weekend before Christmas ... hang the stockings ... last minute shopping ... etc . 
Had a very pleasant Christmas < PROPFEMALE > . After brunch with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > , had a quiet day getting stuff done around the house . Christmas < PROPFEMALE > service featured < PROPFEMALE > backed up by the cherub choir with a wonderful rendition of \Bells Are Ringing\ " . Looking forward to a nice Christmas tomorrow ! " 
Wishes a < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS TO ALL ! 
Listening to WSHS Madrigals alumni rehearse for caroling at < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Terrific group and they sound great ! 
Well the wind sounds cold ... 10 degree chill factors but USair says our flight to Alabama is ontime . Here is hoping that it stays that way . If it does we should be in Alabama by 1035 CST . 
Well ... we arrived safely in Alabama only 45 minutes late ... not bad if you believe the news . Enjoying visiting in Decatur ! 
is having a nice relaxing Birthday Saturday . Had a nice slightly early birthday dinner with the Carpenters and < PROPFIRST > last night before < PROPFIRST>'s big California Adventure . < PROPFEMALE > \helped\ " me open my presents . We had a nice visit at home after . " 
Had a nice long birthday weekend ! We had a great time with < PROPFEMALE > yesterday and today ! Start my new job tomorrow ! Fingers crossed . 
Wishes his commute could be this easy every day ! With schools closed and government on delay no one in the road :-) . 15 minutes to fort Belvoir from the house . :-D 
First week at new job complete . Some good some slow ! Wish every week was only 4 workdays . Nice to have < PROPFIRST > back from CA ! Glad he had a good time and got home safely . 
Thinks yesterday was a real trip ... got sent home early from work ... no problems although it started sleeting about halfway home . Picked up < PROPFEMALE > from babysitter and home to wait for < PROPFEMALE > . Had to go rescue < PROPFEMALE > and finally got her car home and then used my Highlander to take her to get < PROPFEMALE > and took them both home . So far so good ... then at 6:30 NO POWER ! 
is not impressed with Dominion Power ... still no power . Good thing we have a gas fireplace ! < PROPFEMALE > stuck home with no power and no heat . 
thinks his new snow thrower is just spiffy ! Got my driveway done pretty nicely this morning . MUCH better than shovelling . It is just what I need since < PROPFIRST > moved out :-) 
Is happy his power is back on . It took them 24 hours . Here is hoping they really fixed it and didn't just band-aid it . FFX schools are closed again tomorrow ... not sure why this time . 
had a really great time with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > today . We were busy all day with Tae Kwan Do , Lunch , and a visit to the Natural History Museum . < PROPFEMALE > really liked the dinosaurs ! She was so engaged and interested all day long . Fell asleep on the way home and got a very nice nap before going to Grandmama and Papa Piano for the evening . 
Is just finishing a busy weekend . Still trying to get all my data , photos , sings and stuff arranged on my new IMac . Helped < PROPMALE > take the hybrid battery out of his civic so that it can be rebuilt . Then < PROPFEMALE>'s car engine light came on so we had to take the Mazda5 for service . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > wound up taking our Lexus on their trip . Kept busy with lots of stuff but enjoying the Superbowl . 
Can't believe I have been at Fort Belvoir for 4 weeks already ! Time flies when you are busy . Going to celebrate < PROPFEMALE>'s 4th birthday this weekend ! Hard to believe she is already 4 . Kid party is today and family party is tomorrow . Since her birthday is Tuesday she ought to feel like she has celebrated when she is done . 
is having a great weekend so far ! Went skiing with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > at Whitetail on Saturday and < PROPFEMALE > is on her way over to play with me this morning ! 
Had a nice morning with < PROPFEMALE > ! We had a nice breakfast at < PROPMALE > Evans and went shopping . Then we took Grandmama her lunch and got a hug for it ! 
has had a great weekend ! Good weather and lots of time with the family . Now if our elected representatives can do what we pay them for I won't be furloughed after Friday ! 
Had a nice celebration for < PROPFIRST>'s 25th birthday ! Nice relaxing family get together with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , Ghostbuster(Samantha ) , and < PROPFIRST > . Got\ 
a lot of good visiting in . Great way to spend Saturday afternoon ! 
Looking forward to having Ghostbuster < PROPFEMALE > over for a sleepover tonight . I got some Casper cartoons to show her to see what she thinks . Should be fun !
