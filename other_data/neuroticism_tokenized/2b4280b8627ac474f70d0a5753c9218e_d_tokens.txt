Finally , i'm among the employed again . was offered & accepted a position down in Corpus < PROPFEMALE > , Texas . Now to get myself down there with all my things ( a big truck & trailer , how big , the biggest i can get my hands on ) . 

OK , the status is : OMG how much fun a real life outside of this keyboard is . thus my delay in jacking back into the net . figured i'de just post something here for ppl to read to know i'm alive and kicking still . going fishing tonite during the incoming tide ; hopefully it's fish for breakfast tomorrow !. 
nope no fish for breakfast today . didn't catch fish , fed fish shrimp . ug . did however almost put my car in the bay thou . a good samaritan helped me out with a little tow . under that nice solid seaweed is some really slick S&*$ ( dosen't help to have low profile , dry weather , near racing rubber on the car either ) . I'll be staying further away from the water in the future , and if i need to back up i will next time 
DSL is finally up and running , i'm back online again . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
done getting ready for work ; not enough time to go fishing :( i guess i'll try tomorrow . heard that ppl were catching drum under the island bridge ( both black and keeper red ) 
another day another dollar ( ok , 65 cents after washington's cut ) 
IT's Friday , finally !! 
yesterday's fishing report , nutin but those dagnabbit catfish . 
WOOT , no morning dew today ! 
YIPPEE !, this makes 2 days in a week with no morning dew drenching everything . 
Grandma's table top finally sanded . Looks like all but one < PROPFIRST > is going to come out . \) and even the one that's staying is hard to find . Could be staining it thursday after i test on the underside . " 
I like the < PROPMALE > Hall Pier area , didn't go down on the beach itself , offshore wind was filling the car up with sand . 
off to a bonfire !!! don't wait up for me . 
:) had fun at the bonfire . ready for another one ! 
figured out how to not get stuck on the beach . 3rd gear , 6k rpm , don't turn much . 
Off to fish Laguna Madre ! /me hopes for better luck there . 
Round 2 tomorrow morning , early morning :) my time of day . 
3 cats , one OMG i have no idea ugly ugly ugly thing , 1 small red ( too small ) , and broke my tackle . Had fun anyway ! 
:( on call , course i shouldn't be unhappy , won't be next friday ! 
had a blast last nite ( even being sober ! ) !! 
wow , 8 continuous hours of sleep , what a wonderful thing ! cept it's now 0545 and i'm dressed and ready to start work . 
I'm not tired , and i think i should be 
tis tuesday , meter reads , inspections , fillin holes that's what is in store for me today . 
also borrowing this ( from my sister-in-law ): Thought for the day : Some people are like slinkies - not really good for anything , but they bring a smile to your face when pushed down the stairs . 
made it home safely & survived my B-Day weekend ! now off to work . no time for details , srry . 
ug i'm tired , painting since 7am , i think that's enough for a sunday ! 
tis tuesday now and still painting 
Woot , still have 2 teams in the Stanely Cup Playoffs . Would be awesome if the final was Bruins & Red Wings . 
OK , tomorrow better not be another Monday , even thou today did have it's memorable moment . 
wings 3 sharks 4 , :( but it was game 1 on the road and the sharks had an empty net for 2 < PROPFEMALE > and couldn't manage to put the puck in the net . and now i'm tired . 
monday again , thou this is a short week for me , friday's a vacation day ! 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding 
Tis friday for me now , so the weekend , heading out right after work . everybody have a good weekend and be safe ! 
day's half over , and i'm already forgetting stuff ( more than normal ) , the mind ( what little is left ) has left already . 
in < PROPFIRST > , at my brothers , doing absolutely nothing , and loving it . 
back from < PROPFIRST > , safe and sound , made good time , way less trafic so was able to run a little faster and not be anywhere near the fastest on the road . :) 
yep too much sleep last nite , it's 2 hours past my late bedtime and i'm still wide awake . hehe :) 
friday , but not a friday , oncall this week :( 
OMG , hockey is basically over for me . :( all my teams are out ( or never made it in ) . cant believe boston lost their series . 
OK , hockey , my pick to win the cup is the blackhawks , i think they are the hottest team . should have zero issue taking on either east coast team ; and should take the sharks in 5 games . i think the final will be a 7 or 6 game series . east coast will also probably go the distance as well ( :) i love game 7's!!!! even when it's a hated team . ) 
monday monday monday , tis going to be a monday for a few days . 
tuesday brings rain , thankfully it's coming after i wake today . left the top down last nite , hehe . 
Sneaky FB ... As of today , there is a NEW PRIVACY\ 
setting called \Instant Personalization\ " that shares data with non-Facebook\ 
ya know , since i left < PROPFIRST > , the top has been down 95% + of the time ; i love corpus ! 
ug , the shorts i bought this morning are too big , going to have to take them back and get smaller ones . :) 
totally figures , 20% < PROPMALE > of trace showers , and i get a real shower on my car since i polished and waxed it yesterday . 
yep froggy outside , morning dew looks more like it rained . this i'm getting used to . at least the top comes down with the fog !! 
:) cleaned the clutter from my comp desk AGAIN !!! this thing just collects crap . it's not a computer desk , it's a crap magnet . 
confusion sets in once again , but i'm cool wit it . heck if life was ordinary and predictable it would be sooooooo boring ! \ 
\ 
Everybody remember what memorial day is for , and please stop and remember all the fallen soldiers on monday 3pm , even if only for a moment . \ 
now enjoy the summer !! 
back from the Big Easy . had a great time . saw a bunch of swamp , the french quarter , rode the old street car thru New Orleans , went to Cafe Du Monde ( awesome place ) , the french market , a couple notable clubs . drove the lake poncetrain bridge a few times . oh yea got flashed on bourbon street . got a speeding ticket on the way there ( and i for once wasn't actually speeding ! ) 
actually enjoyed the storm when it was happening . yea i'm crazy love weather like that . it's the aftermath that's killin me . cleanup continues , and continues , and continues ! 
well hopefully nutin big and important is happing in < PROPFIRST > , as i've a bunch of missed calls . off to the beach :) don't know when i'll be back . 
omg , just realized i haven't had socks on all weekend . i kinda like it . no stinky feet :) although there's lots of sand about . 
windsurfing in the morning . :-) , i'll be sore , tired , and unable to remember a damn thing on monday , but heck that's normal . 
hehe , this post is @ 0530 and i've been up over 3 hours now ( i did get 6 hours sleep btw ) . sholders , upper back , and biceps are sore , hands just a little tender and stiff ; and i'm liking the feeling ( it's not a bad sore , more like a good workout sore ) . 
ohhh noooo , i've got a company phone now . help me please !!!! but then again it seems to have internet access : OH NOOOOO , SOMEBODY SAVE ME !!!!!! i'll fall into pixel world again . ( thank god i'm not playing ogame anymore ) . 
i'm in trouble . already figured out how to connect to wireless networks with this new phone . 
ikm in such trouble now . 
runk ! 
argh , another grumpy day for me . 
argh , it's 10am and only 4mph wind . why why why , i wanted that depression to come our way . 
monday morning , hopefully the week is quiet and quick . 
monday went quick , but think i'de rather have done waiter duty . tomorrow is shaping up to be quite a bit better thou , more rain .. :) 
Carbon ??? \ 
Actually , we'd prefer a reduction in our GOVERNMENT footprint !! \Like\ " \ 
i'm tired , collecting up all the damn trees from the last storm ; all darn day , almost 12 hours of continuous work . 
i think the last time i felt tropical weather ( specifically a typhoon/hurricane ) was in okinawa . way way way back in the early 90's . srry this isn't much , it is however for me a great time's reminder ; wish i had a deck of cards and a bunch of jarheads around to play spades with for 6 days . 
feels good to be back in a country mood , 14 of the first 15 songs on my top rated are country again . :) 
long weekend over , short week beginning . so hard week , since i've got to fit 5 days work into 4 days . 
still have 5 days work to stick into this week . :( 
tis a new week , maybe it'll be better than last . at least it's supposed to be mostly dry this week . 
i tink i over did my peanut sauce tonite . uh , either too much jalepeno or red pepper , maybe too much garlic . actually most probably all 3 , but damn if it didn't taste good . thank god i didn't have any habenero peppers around . 
bummer day , had to work early thus no fishing , and omg we're getting gust now @ 6mph , yea , no wind . 
b 
:) not noon yet and i'm runk , hehe . tis a good thing ; maybe , if i can get the one thing done i need done .

okies , lack of sleep finally cought up to me . nitey nite world . 
morning world ! TGIF , it's finally here !!!! 
nitey nite world . going to sleep early , so i can go catch fish in the dark . maybe if they can't see me they will stop laughing long enough to hook themselves . ( originally said on the bait but ug , no hook on the bait ) 
i wonder ( taking a quote from a song ) will it be a Sweet Dream or a Beautiful Nightmare tonite ? i like the song . 
Monday started great , did the usual monday junk . BUT it ended on a good note ! so i've a smile and am happy again ( i'm easy to please i know ) 
im'a going to feel like crap tomorrow . wish i could call in sick tomorrow ( well wish my concience would let me ) . 
daily answer : just a nightmare , and i was right last nite , i feel like crap . 
morning . neither sweet or beautiful last nite ! :) 
Woo Hoo , no pain in the foot finally ! thou it's still a bit swollen , but just a little bit . 
daily answer , again neither sweet or beautiful . 
DA : neither again :) , good nite of sleep ; feeling almost human again . I'm < PROPFEMALE > glad it's not as hot down here as < PROPFIRST > ( i'm tired but not sick from the heat so far this summer ) . 
DA : beautiful nightmare i think . another week starting . dosen't really matter this week as i'll be oncall at the end of it anyway . watch it be a great week that dosen't wipe me out . 
DA : neither . 
DA : beautiful nightmare , but was still a good one . 
DA : beautiful nightmare again , thou was quite interesting , no details here . 
da hair is short again . :) the face still looks dirty thou . 
no idea what last nite's dreams were about , but it had to be active , my torso is killing me . 
24 hours and i'm on vacation ( technically 20.5 hours :) ) ! 
on vacation , picked up my 2mtr trainer kite ; and got it flying , even somewhat under control . OMFG , if a 2mtr kite generates this kind of power , i wonder what a 9mtr kite's going to do ( that's supposed to be the normal size for my weight ) . I am officially scared ! AWESOME i love that feeling ! 
waiting for a little more wind this morning to take the trainer kite back out and play ! at least i got the launching down last nite , so i should be able to spend more time in the air today ( as opposed to last nite where i spent the hour or so figuring out how to get the darn thing in the air ) . 
suns up , 3mph wind atm . ug 
DA : no beautiful nightmares for a few days ( unfortunately no sweet dreams either ) . 
omg , i'm not myself , second day i woke up after the sun . no beautiful nightmares or sweet dreams last nite either 
DA : neither , just a regular old nightmare . 
ug i hate wakin up at 0230 . screws up the rest of the week . 
whoa , what a dream ! time to put the bed back together . comment as you wish , but the sheets don't need changing , still was an awesome dream ; thou i'll be tired all darn day 
ug , da : bn . oh well good thing i'm still in a good mood from friday morning . 
They say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and don't hold grudges . They understand that life is ...... busy , but that you will always love them . Re-post if you are blessed to have at least one of these friends 
long weekend , not much planed . a bbq & bonfire today , hittin kiting spots tomorrow , haven't decided on monday yet 
tis beach time for me , even thou i've done been there once today . you all have a great saturday , be safe , have fun , and get back home alive ! off to packery channel ! 
rught now i'm not in a very good mood , actully i'm in a very very very bad mood atm ... for those who actcually know what i'm fully capable of of ... although the parties who put me in this mood have zero idea of my capabilities , or more precisely my willingness to shed consequences .... for those who watch these captions , stay the f ' away . 
happy days ! enjoy all ! 
guess it's a facebook day . tis ok i guess . yappy me has nutin to say cept why is it still humid in my place when i'm 2 deg under the darn dewpoint ! 
rofl , i thought that TD-10 was going into mexico . well it made a 90deg right turn and is currently sitting just south west of me . no wonder it's raining cats and chiwawa's . and the forcast for us has changed from some rain today into rain all freaking week . 
well i think i may have figured out why i was sooooo freaking grumpy all week . lack of exercise . ( didn't realize how much exercise hooping is till i sacrificed my hoop to do a water heater replacement ) . 
fun sailing my sensi this morning in 3-5mph winds . was hard to sail , but i learned a lot about how speed makes a sail produce power . :) 
the warm test on my potato salad is promising , a little short on the celery but the rest is bang on . :) 
okies , my potato salad is delicious !, and it's gone , i think i might be sick tonite . i'm not hungry or thirsty ( thirsty being the really bad part ) . 
i'm < PROPFEMALE > ready for the evenings to get under 70 deg . at least they are consistently going under 80 deg ( for almost all of this summer they've gone under 80 at some point every day )

OK , so maybe my calves were still in the water , but my knees were out . What fun !!!! haven't been up on a board yet , can't wait .

I was trying to think of something unique and maybe a little witty , but the fact that I will have to put \going to work\ " somewhere in there ruins it all . " 
:) wooo hooo . at least saturday is looking good for getting out in the water . 10-15knt winds starting from the E going to SE . friday sucks even thou i have the afternoon off :( north winds so the only decently safe place is oleander point and it's a deep water area so not good for bodydraging . ( that and it'll be an onshore wind with some umph , maybe i'll try it anyway ) .

all wind directions and speeds are good for the place i'm going to and my kite/board size . they are even good for going into the surf . really wish i knew a site where i could get wave reports for corpus . 
dumb fog till 11am UGGG ! means the wind won't pick back up till at least 1pm 
a productive day for me i do believe . :) 
day one new job . went well even thou there was painting involved . got it all over me and that being oil based Kilz . time to get myself cleaned up . 
day 3 new job . it's soooo nice to have equipment , and even better when you don't have the right equipment ; the boss goes out and gets the right equipment . :) 
phew made it to friday . i'm pooped , but happy ! 
i wish my stuff would jump into the boxes on it's own . it always seems to move around on it's own whenever i go looking for something . 
the packing is progressing well :) it's < PROPFEMALE > much easier when i can just take a break when i'm tired of packing . kiting gear done , fishing gear done , bedroom done ( cept for what i need next week ) , kitchen done ( same as bdrm ) , and of course computer ( cept for what i need to stay sane ! ) . only < PROPMALE > things left is the furniture that needs disassembly & OMG my tool room ( that's going to take a while ) .
