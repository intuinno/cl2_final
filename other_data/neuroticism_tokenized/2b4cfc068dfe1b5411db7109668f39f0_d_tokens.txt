Trying this out now ... 

officially full of con plague ... 
is feeling better , but back to work . Trying to decide if this is good or bad ... 
Seeing < PROPMALE > of Persia today ! 
thinks ... success ! The PoP movie was actually ... dare I say it , good ! Amazing ! 
just realized : it's summer and he's in a classroom for the next 5 hours . Something's wrong with this picture ... 
hates idiots who don't know they're idiots ... which is most of them . 
is bouncing excitedly and somewhat apprehensively for Metroid tomorrow . 
finished Other M in 10:38 , with 100% completion . Officially savior of the galaxy again . 
is sick of animating . Gah . 
will never understand programmers . It's been three weeks , why are my animations still not in the game ! 
wants to know how so many people in one of the fattest cities in the country want salads at the same time . 
doesn't know if the movie's any good , but the Tron Legacy soundtrack is downright amazing . Daft Punk channeling < PROPMALE > Zimmer through a time machine from the 80s . 
is pissed off and for good reason . Not saying more here out of what little respect I have for certain people , but I will not sit and take this peacefully ... 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . D: Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower , armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 1% are awesome , and will re-post this . Will you ?
