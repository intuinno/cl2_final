Other than the fact that I was just informed that the American democracy is slowly creeping toward communism , today was the best day ever ! 
I DO NOT WANT A TORNADO ! D: 
Am I the only person in the world that feels the need to sing slow songs to my horsie when he gets worked up ? Is that a weird thing to say ? 
I cleared out a new trail at the barn today . No more crossing the road if I don't feel like it ! :) 
All excited for Horse Judging , State horse show , other horse shows , and all that other horse mess ! :) . I'm such a nerd . 
I like to dance to loading zone announcements . 
Took my horsie swimming in the pond today ! :D I had to practically drag him in but he eventually went in and actually swam a little ! 
What would I do without you ? :) 
ANYBODY THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY RIDDEN MY HORSE , TOAST , NEEDS TO COME BACK AND RIDE AGAIN , SOOONNN ! It is my new goal to get pictures of everyone who has ridden Toast in my new Pony Rides album !

On my way to Williamston for State horse judging ! Can't wait to see everybody again ! Have fun at the prom everybody at McMichael ! 
My judging trip is complete . I don't even care if I place now or not because I have been reunited with my best horse buddies ! Best night ever ! 
Apparently the only radio stations that don't edit their songs well or edit anything else for that matter , are Rockingham and Guilford county . Maybe that's why we have such high STD and pregnancy rates . Lol

I love you , I hate you , I can't live without you . 
At a tailgating party . Fearful of getting hit in the head by a beer bottle . 
99% of all human beings are idiots . Whether it be academically , mentally , socially , or emotionally . 
Drunk people at the campground : \Whyu don't you get up on this big mammal ? OHHH WE'RE TROTTING ! \"" 
A horse is the projection of peoples ' dreams about themselves - strong , powerful , beautiful - and it has the capability of giving us escape from our mundane existence . ~ Pam Brown

Working on a personal statement for the NC State and < PROPFEMALE > scholarships . This is going to be long ... 
How do you adjust the volume on the sterio if you have the TV on at the same time ? Why do you want the stereo on if you're watching TV ? Cause I like to party .
