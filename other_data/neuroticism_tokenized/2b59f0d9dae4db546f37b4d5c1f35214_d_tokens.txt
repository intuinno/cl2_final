Can't wait till finally get myself pretty for my birthday . My face itches from not shaving . 

Sitting at home bored . Should he go out ? 
Got my ass beat last night at work . Thank God tonight is my LAST SHIFT AT APPLEBEE'S!! :-) 
Broken 
I'm so in love and can't help to feel pain inside ... I pray for strength ... I pray to have him next to me . 
Just needs some reassurance that everything will be okay 
I'm keeping the faith 
I miss him so much ... 
I'll be strong for you 
It felt so good holding him in my arms and feeling his lips against mine . I miss him ... 
There is something different about tonight 
watched a scary movie and got scared sh**less for once 
Happy New Years San < PROPMALE > !!! 
So my phone is official a piece of shit . I need an upgrade desperately . Birthday present anyone ? \ 
\ 
Last night was fun and to all the text I'm getting now about last night and the text I couldn't send , \Happy New Year to you too ! \ " \ 
Coming undone 
I just connected the Merovingian to bananas on wikipedia ! Geez My WikiPedia game is so much fun when you're bored . 
So my mind desperately tries to forget the memories my heart won't let go 
Better never to have met you in my dream than to wake and reach for hands that are not there . 
Once you kill a cow you have to make a burger 
Time will make you forget me but time will make me love you more than before . 
So picking up a pan that was in a preheated oven for 30 mins isn't always the smartest idea . My hand is killing me -_- , Reason # 58559 why < PROPMALE > doesn't cook 
These are the days of our lives 
I played pictonary with a blind girl 
Come to Carrollwood Applebees ! 2 for 1 drinks all night ! < PROPFIRST > and I are having a blast watching the Rays tonight !

Hated today but I'm at where I wanted to be ... laying in bed .

I love when I only get an hour of sleep because I couldn't get my mind to STFU ! :-/ 
Going through old random journals , notes , blogs and unsent emails ... tomorrow I'll pour my heart out and hopefully someone will understand my thoughts . Get ready to see me put my heart and soul's deepest thoughts out in public . 
And so it begins ... 
Too hot to hike ... beach day with Kirstyn ! 
I woke up entirely too early today . 
Done indulging myself in the sound of others voices ... time to relax at home on the couch . 
It's cold and I'm breaking out into hives ... :(
