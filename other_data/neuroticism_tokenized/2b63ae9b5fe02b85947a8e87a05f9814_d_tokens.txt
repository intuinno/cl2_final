The Sloth Demon can bite me . 

If one has been deaf it's entire life , what language does it think in ? 
Have we justified the means ? 
A toast to Disengage by Suicide Silence : one of the heaviest songs I have ever had the pleasure of hearing . 
Yeah , so I was wrong . Drinking with friends isn't so bad after all . 
I stand corrected . Newest obsession goes to the Cancer Bats \Sorceress . \ " \ 
Following at a close second is the most southern song I will ever call beloved , Maylene and the Sons of Disaster \Step Up ( I'm on It) \"." 
Call me what you want . I am still taking your cake . 
And now , for something completely different : \

Oh noes ! Hurricane < PROPMALE > ! Hide your trucks and your moonshine ! 
I will never look at a week-whacker the same way again . Thank you , < PROPMALE > Trejo . 
All hail Wikipedia , one of the most infectious things on Earth . I just did this Wiki-trail : \ 
Photon > Black Body > Ultraviolet Catastrophe > 20 July Plot ( Operation Valkyrie ) 
Yes , yes . Now , get in the bag . 
I used to like Projectile Motion ...

I hate religion . I don't need a cult ! The world doesn't need any more fakes . \ 
So I walk a new path , no one chooses for me . \

Impending Doom - Children of Wrath 
If anyone out there who :\ 
1 - is into Anime at all\ 
2 - has the free time\ 
Try to hunt down the series Claymore . It is a bit hit/miss here and there , but for the six HUGE surprises in there , I am extremely impressed by it . 
Being crazy sick from a cold ? Sucks . \ 
Still being sick when New Vegas premiers , giving me a GOOD reason why not to go anywhere ? Worth it . 
Ladies and Gentlemen , we may have a contestant for my Favorite Game of All Time . New Vegas is mind-crushingly beautiful . 
Finished New Vegas last night . Absolutely amazing . 
Undead milk tastes like raspberries . 
\Grenades\ " by the Cancer Bats is excellent . Almost forgot about it ... " 
You know , I learned a valuable thing today . As I was standing in the ridiculously huge line to vote , I realized why I was there . To balance out the rest of the people in said line . I wish I was making this up : \I need an I.D. to vote ? Since when ?! \"" 
\It was like watching someone caress a brick with a ham hock . \"" 
Last night was absolutely superb . Papa < PROPFIRST>'s and several excellent rounds of Black Ops with Chairman was followed up by seven episodes of Batman : The Animated Series . Yeah , you are jealous . 
\Don't try to deny it 
You know it's a bad day when the time spent at work was the best part of it . 
\My dear young Lady 
Yay , let's do what all the cool kids are doing ! 
I take back a lot of the horribly violent thoughts I've had towards Obsidian . Why the change of heart ? Being able to propel a Deathclaw 25 feet backwards with the happy-happy Anti-Material Rifle with AP rounds . Instead , they will be on probation while I complete \Render Unto Caesar . \"" 
I killed the Legendary Deathclaw in one shot . Yeah , I am that awesome . 
But I do and I don't want to care anymore , \ 
If I close my eyes would it spare me the sight ? \ 
Of decay , corruption , how we nurture destruction\ 
And everything that will doom us all . \

Sinbad's thoughts on marriage :\ 
“You have to go to the movies together . One listens and the other one watches . You become a team . One has a good right hip and the other has a good left hip so you can balance . ‘They’re so cute together , ’ – no , they’d fall down without one another . ” 
Yeah , I'm posting \Merry Christmas\ " a day late . Say something . Go ahead . " 
I'm not sure if I'm happy or sad that it took < PROPFEMALE>'s greatest snowstorm to shut me down .
