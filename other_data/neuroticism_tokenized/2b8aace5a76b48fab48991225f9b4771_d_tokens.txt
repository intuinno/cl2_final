So I found out today that I have Complete Placenta Previa . Yay for bed rest high risk possible c section pregnancy ... 
My back is killing me , my tummy is cramping and really tight , my leg goes numb when I lay down , so no sleep for me .... Oh Joy !!!

I cant wait till Saturday !!! I get to go see my baby girl in 3D/4D again !!! I wonder how much she has changed in 1 month =D 
Why cant I sleep for the past few days ??? ARGH !!! And now Jett is sick ... first is baby Jett , then its me , now its him =( Hope hes better before Saturday !!!

Bump Bump ... Bumpity bump bump .... 
I love how for the past few days I have not been able to go to sleep because a certain lil girl thinks 2-6am is gymnastics practice time . Im lucky I have a wonderful boyfriend who lets me sleep in when Im able to get to sleep finally though and takes care of Baby Jett . I love him & hearts ; 
I wish I could go to sleep before the sun comes up like normal people ... ugh 
If you have a wonderful husband that works hard to take care of you and would do anything for you , then repost this as your status to give the honest good men out there the recognition that they deserve . Because great men are few and far between , and I have one of them ? * Not a husband but might as well be lol * 
~ RIP ~ Grandma . We all love and miss you , cant believe its been 10yrs today . I wish you could of met my kids , they would of loved you so much like we all did . They are missing out on some good holiday food also !! Happy Easter to you and grandpa , xoxo

In loving memory of every cancer patient who has lost their battle with cancer & in celebration of the ones who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > if you know someone who has or had cancer ? 
I am 7mo pregnant today !!!! I cant believe this is going by so fast ... Feels like it has only been a month since we found out !!!! 
Feels like my lil one is break dancing in my belly =O 
I am now in my 3rd trimester !!!! Almost done !!! Its carazy , this has gone by so fast !!! 
Lotta Cream popsicles are the best invention ever 
28wks down 12wks to go !!!! 
So my Doctors office just called and told me I have gestational diabetes . How lovely . The weird thing is that I didnt have it with Jett but I gained 85lbs . I have it with this one but I only gained 7lbs so far . So on Monday I am getting put on a strict diet . Awsome . 
So I told the doc that I wanted the 3hr test since a lot of ppl fail the 1hr but pass the 3hr , but nope still dont get the 3hr . I have to follow a special diet , which wasnt even explained to me , for 3wks . After the 3wks they are going to let me take the 1hr again . But the 1hr is just a screening to see if I need the 3hr ... so I should still take the 3hr test like your supposed to do if you fail the 1hr . UGH !!! 
Tomorrow I will be 3/4 the way there !!! 30wks down 10 or less to go !!! Saturday we have our last 3D ultrasound . I cant wait to see how big shes gotten in the past 6wks !!! 
If you have a wonderful man that works hard\ 
to take care of you , would do anything for you , that makes you laugh , \ 
that's your best friend , who you want to grow old with , who is your\ 
world and someone that you're thankful for every night . Then post this\ 
as your status to give the good men out there the recognition they\ 
deserve , because great men are few and far between . 
Saturday we get to see our baby girl !!! 
In 8hrs we are going to see our lil girl !!! 10am cant come fast enough .... 
Our lil girl has such chubby cheeks !!! She also loves to make faces !!! She is still head down like she has always been . I think she has daddy's side of the family's nose though ... I just put pics up of the last ultrasound too !!! 
Great . Its 94 degrees outside and our air is not working . We we had the air on all night and woke up and it said it was 85 in here !!! So we had to turn it off so it wont constantly run and do nothing . Cant open windows because we need new screens for them , most dont have any . We tried to open them and within 7min 3 wasps came in the house . There is only a fan in our bedroom and the kitchen , no not much help . 
31wks which is 8mo today !!! Almost time !!! =D 
These weeks are going by so fast ... Shes going to be here sooner then we think ... Should I be happy or sad ? Except for the gaining weight and back pain , I love being pregnant and feeling her kick my organs =p lol

Jett has to work till 7:30 am =( .... I hate being home alone at night it freaks me out !!! 
I hate stupid people 
I wish people would stop grouping religion with pro-life all the time . I am pro-life but am NOT religious . It pisses me off to be honest because a lot of the argument is god god god , then the bible thumpers make pro-life look ridicules . I have reasons why I believe what I do but religion is NOT one of them . Not ALL of us are \bible nazis\ " as somebody put it today ... lol ... just venting .... " 
Doctors tomorrow ... ugh ... I been sick since Friday and I cant take meds for it so it lasts longer ... it really sucks !!! 
Hmm ... one site says I am 34wks ... another says 35wks .... so hmmm ....

To all the unselfish moms out there who traded eyeliner for dark\ 
circles , salon haircuts for ponytails , long showers for quick showers , \ 
late nights for early mornings , designer bags for diaper bags , and\ 
WOULD NOT change a thing . Lets see how many moms repost this . Moms who\ 
don't care about .. whatever they gave up , and .. instead LOVED .. what ... they got/get in return . Repost this if you're a mom and LOVE your KIDS 
Random fact : The percent of people born with red hair , is the same percent of people born a hermaphrodite 
I hate people who always say how they cant get anybody and they think they are ugly or whatever , and/or sooooo lonely . But yet they always have a bunch of people hitting on them and wanting to be with them ... like wtf seriously ? Shut the fuck up already ... 
Men always want to be a woman's first love , and women always want to be a man's last romance 
3 more days till my baby boys * Not so baby anymore * Birthday Party !! If you can or cant make it and havent let us know , please let us know by tomorrow so we know how much food wise to get !! =D 
Awwwwww ... lol * look below * 
YAY INTERVEIW WOOO !! 
I love how every place is only hiring for seasonal ... for 1mo only !!! UGH ! 
I love the people in my life & hearts ; 
I loved you the minute I knew I was pregnant . I loved you the minute you were born Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you & to this day I still would ? When you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision\ 
to allow your heart to walk around outside your body ? ... Put this on your status , if you have children you love more than life . 
Im not sure what I believe anymore , but please pray for my father and grandmother . My father was in a motorcycle accident on the 10th and broke many bones and had/has bleeding in the brain . He checked himself out of the hospital against doctors orders but he still needs to be there because I called him today and hes still messed up . My Grandma has a mass in her lung and finding out tomorrow if its cancer or not ... 
Well ... just found out today that the mass on my Grandmas lung is indeed cancer . Shes getting a cat scan and some more tests soon to see if it has spred or not ... hope not . Shes home from the hospital now , in high spirits as always . I hope I am as strong as she is if something like this ever happens to me ... No word on my dad though ... Im going to try to call him tomorrow 
So excited !!! =D

Why do I keep thinking about zombies ? I hear a noise outside and my mind instantly goes to zombies . I go outside and my mind makes me imagine there are zombies out there coming after me . I was in the kitchen making sure the door was locked , what do I think in my head ? \Would locked doors be better protection from zombies because they are locked or does it even matter because all they do is beat on the door ? \ " WTF !?!? " 
Really ? My son comes into the room with magic the gathering cards and wants me to play with him .... damnit Jett turning our son into a nerd !!

Im starting to hate it here ! The people above us can not take a single step without stomping ! They are now messing with what sounds like a closet door and I think they are breaking it !!! I keep hearing them yell also ! I think at 2am I am going to start pounding on the ceiling to keep them up and see how they like it ! The walls shouldnt be this thin ! I have been in a lot of apartments and never had this problem ! GRRR ! 
Who the fuck vacuums at 3:43 am ? No that's ok I didn't need sleep anyways ... Oh more stomps now and talking very loudly ! 
So I let spike go outside to pee and somebody from above us was throwing snowballs at him !! 
Those kids above us must not of been good this year , so they are not expecting < PROPFEMALE > to come . Must be why they are stomping around slamming doors at 3:50 am . Well they need to be quiet so < PROPFEMALE > can come to our home , MY kids have been good , and I dont want < PROPFEMALE > to skip us because of the noise above ! 
Tzipporah just started to actually crawl crawl with her knees ! Not scooting ! She moved one knee then the next knee 5 times in a row to get to her pink puppy ! WOOO ! Big girl ! 
Off to see the wizard ... the wonderful wizard of OZ !!! 
I live a boring life ...

Poor Tzipporah .... first time she is sick =( . She didnt go to sleep till 1am but slept till 4pm . Her cheeks are so red ...

Why are people adding me that I went to school with but never talked to ? No I wont add you sorry ... stalkers 
Wisdom Teeth FTL 
So on the 18th my lil man has to go to the hospital for his teeth to be worked on , because they are putting him to sleep for it . It says , Diagnosis : Severe dental caries in the presence of severe acute situational anxiety . * Whatever that means * Planned Procedure : Complete oral rehabilitation under general anesthesia w/ endotracheal intubation & possible dental EXT . * Oh jeez =( * 
I am a poopnose ! 
I think Im goin to go to IU , they have the most info on their < PROPFEMALE > and I heard that its better then the other places . Plus , I cant find shit on any other ones online . IU is a little bit of a drive but it will be worth it in the long run . You have to do a lot of stuff for what I want to do , like take another course for 2yrs before I do what I want .
