Trying to paint a word picture of a place or thing is so much esker than capturing the emotion of the place or thing . I wish , sometimes I could pour my thoughts onto the paper straight from my brain . I seem to lose something when the thought journeys down my arm to the pen . Maybe the paper doesn't speak < PROPFEMALE > . 
Dear who ever replaced my normal life with a bad soap opera script , \ 
YOU SUCK !!! Yes , I'm talking to you Devil . \
