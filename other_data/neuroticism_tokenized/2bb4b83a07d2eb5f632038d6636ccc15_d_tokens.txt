wants to see Zombieland . the movie that seems like it would be my kinda life . lol 
I Hate this fuckin world . with a passion 
whats the point 
theres nothing ever wrong , but nothings ever right , such a cruel contradiction / I know i cross the line . its not easy to define , i'm born to indecision / theres always something new , some path im supposed to choose , with no particular rhyme or reason 
Zombieland is the best zombie movie of decade . Killing zombies with a banjo for the win . ;) 
Some People worry if they left on the stove .... I WORRY ABOUT THE ZOMBIE UPRISING . 
im not really into r&b or rap but i hadnt heard this song in a long time and i figured it would be an awsome intro song to a zombie flick . like while the credits are playing and intro to the cast . its called all i wanna do Bang bang and take your money . its by mia . bad ass for its kind of music and killer zombie movie song lol . but then again so would songs by Tenacious D .

Heart beat slows , the blood calmly drifting through the veins . Thoughts cease and the mind goes blank . Serenity is within reach as the body begins to , for once , relax . It’s within reach your fingers grasping into that otherworldly realm . The time spent in meditation is about to pay off . And then something brushes the very deepest depths of consciousness . 
And suddenly you are assaulted by the nightmare of the past and future . You’re ripped from the serene realm of utter silence , and tossed back into the world of shattered hopes and dreams . And when your eyes open , you realize it was no more than a dream . 
Man high schoolers are so lucky . I didnt get a snow day 
SWEET !!!!!! I now have Xbox Live in my barracks .. OH YEAH woot

wishes life was easier to forsee and handle . sigh . I had a great weekend but it stirred up alot of things within the darkest depths of my mind .

Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree 
I forgot how much i love Creedence Clearwater Revival
