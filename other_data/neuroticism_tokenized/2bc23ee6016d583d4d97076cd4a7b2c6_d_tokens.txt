I think i've finally reached the point in my life where i simply don't give a crap what immature idiots think , I used to say that i didn't , but now i've actually come to an awesome realization that all that matters is being happy with yourself . Being a little philosophical , sort of unusual , but i don't care anymore . 
Song for < PROPFIRST > , \I'm Awesome\ " - Spose "

Taking the ultimate test of how long I can go without standing up . Plan to be in Reno by 8:30 .

the only thing bad about being on the road is that truckers are being dumbasses . they pass eachother doing half a mile an hour different from eachother , takes like five minutes and they block the entire road . 
One hour away from rock and roll history museum & hall of fame

The worst things about idiots is that they have to live with themselves , in their own idiocy , every day . I don't think I could do it . 
I wonder if Hardees knows that it's copying carls Jr. 
Clubbed to death - escala it's a cover song , i'v heard the original but can't remember the name or the artist . An anyone help ?

You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location . The kind of place where there might be a monster , or some kind of weird mirror . These are just examples . It could also be something much better . You are about to enter ... The Scary Door .

Should have seen it from the start , such a tool . 
Playing Waidmanns Heil on GH , thunder starts roaring to the beat of the drums . AWESOME 
I'm half sure that it's pretty unhealthy ( mentally ) to be walking around pointing out the things that people have that makes their lives better than mine . I wonder if I should find something better to do with my time , maybe a better question , if I even can .

\It would appear that we both have opposing views about this simple topic . I SHALL KILL YOU UNLESS YOU CHANGE YOUR DEVILISH WAYS . \""

I'm looking for a gameboy game that the name of i can't remember . but i can tell you how the beginning goes . \ 
You start off as a kid , being bullied in the < PROPMALE > , one of the kids tells you that if you can get the magical < PROPFEMALE > in the back of some dark cave , they'll be friends with you . So , being the idiot you are , you say ok . you wander to the back of the cave/maze and pick up the < PROPFEMALE > . as soon as you grab it 
\But I can't wear socks ... i'm a doorknob \"" 
Just rediscovered how much i like \New Found Glory \"" 
Why is it that at the sight of a loose cable everyone in this house goes f*cking braindead and waves their arms all over the place making the issue worse ?
