I hate myself for being bored on a Saturday night . When did that start happening ? :( 
< PROPFIRST > Osmer , either there is something wrong with your phone or there is something wrong with you . My texts are important ! :( 
Facebook is very boring when all of my friends are at school ... 
:/\ 
That's all ... 
Sometimes , decisions are made the hardest when the answer's right in front of you . My question is : how do you decide to take that step ? I am certain that I'm not the only one asking this question . 
I'm on my third time through Algebra 2B ... So why does it still aggrivate me this much ? :( 
I'm on my third time through Algebra 2A ... So why does it still aggrivate me this much ? :( 
Almost done with The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ! 
isnt it annoying when people dont use punctuation it makes it very hard to tell what they are saying maybe people could understand them better if they would use what they learned in third grade really how hard is it to insert a period or something every once in a while 
I think I'll make some tea . 
Repeating consonants in a word does NOT show it is sustained !! Example :\ 
supppppper = Wrong !!! :( \ 
suuuuuuper = Right !!! :) 
I will be competing in the first ever OCHS Cardboard Boat Regatta ! I am going to build a boat entirely out of cardboard and duct tape and race it against other boats at the OC pool next Saturday , < PROPFIRST > . 29 . I had better see all my friends there ! :D 
Attention , everyone : For my birthday , I would like a camera . 
So I hear the end to a song , and the guy goes REALLY high , so I try to match it . ( I succeed ) Then the announcer-person says , \Wow ... That guy sounds just like a chick !! \"" 
Such a beautiful day ! I wish it could last forever ... :( 
Today , I learned that guitar strings make great headbands . 
I now know how hard it is to find a store that will give you a big cardoard box . Who knew working on a boat could be so tiring ? :/ 
Well , we lost the boat race ... But we won most creative ! :) 
I think all my friends and I should have a pool party at the aquatic center sometime . 
My news feed is approximately 95% FARMVILLE NOTICES !! Unacceptable . :( 
I guess I'll go to sleep now . I hate school . 
I never get tired of listening to I'm Yours . :) 
Omigosh , I haven't heard Mambo Number 5 since I was about 10 . Then that Bing commercial mentioned it , and now I just heard it on the radio , lol . Used to be my favorite song . 
\What's up ? \ " \ 
I already miss my hair . :( 
I wish Burnout wasn't so fun ; I would've been asleep hours ago ! 
I could be asleep right now if I had :\ 
1 : A roaring fireplace ... \ 
2 : A cup of tea ... \ 
3 : A Big-mac ... \ 
None of which are complete without the others . 
Soldiering Life by the Decemberists . I suggest everyone listens to it . 
Sammich wasn't enough ; Time for clam chowder ! :D 
I love soy sauce ... 
Has anyone noticed that Facebook's clock is about 3 hours ahead ? 
I wish I had a horse like Bravestar's ... 
Haha , Sherlock Holmes fell into a time warp and landed in the 23rd century with Bravestar . Awesome ! 
My only wish : that I could slow down time . 
Anyone want to go to a Flash Freeze event with me ? :) 
My favorite surprise : when I eat a piece of chocolate and find peanut butter on the inside . :) 
I guess I AM going to Spring Thaw . :) 
Maybe it'll be a double-snow day !... But that would mean I couldn't give blood ... 
I guess I have to do my homework , since the snow is sleeping ... 
Yay , it's snowing a little bit ! ^_^ 
I've stockpiled some snow in our industrial sized freezer . I'll make it a snow day tomorrow if I have too !!! 
Who agrees that this does NOT feel like a friday ? 
I'm making a 4-stage 4-colored ice sphere incubated in snow . I wonder what it will look like ? 
My ice experiment is taking FOREVER to freeze ! I want it frozen by morning ... 
Who all had a good evening ? Mine was exceptional , but it lacked a certain special something . 
Best game ever ? Yoshi's Story ! :) 
Best song ever ? Hey < PROPFIRST > ! :) 
I hate reading with a pencil ... 
I wish \ Mr. Blue Sky\ " could by my in-life theme song . " 
Good night . zzzzzz 
I can't see the times that stuff got posted ! :( 
\ ... Sees the sun going down 
Just because I like to talk to people does NOT mean I'm addicted to facebook ! 
Does anyone have a reason as to why so many people love the color blue ? 
I can't wait for summer ! Everything's better in summer ; except for the lack of cool mornings , I might kinda miss those ... 
I don't know what this movie is , but it's pretty cool ; man stuck with an alien , hate eachother , and both have to work together . Pretty funny too , if not cheesy . 
I have gotten slightly closer to achieving my goal ... 
Stomach ache ... Hope I'm not sick ... 
Anyone feel like cheering me up ? 
Does anyone else feel like it's a Tuesday ? 
I wonder how many instuments I can learn to play ( well ) before I'm 30 ? 
Today was a little better . How is everyone ? 
I now have undeniable proof that men are better . :) 
I just spent the last 15 minutes or so organizing , for the most part , all of my interests from least to greatest on Facebook . Time well spent . 
Who actually knows me ? ( you guessed it . Im bored :P ) I hope somebody can asset all of these questions correctly ! First name___________ . Middle name_________ . Last name__________ . Age___ . Birthday________ . Eye color______ . Nickname________ . Favorite cartoon_______ . Favorite Color________ . Favorite Candy : ________ . Put this as you status and see who knows you ! 
Today was OK . Anyone else ?

\Ow owie !! \ " \ 
Who wants to join my clan in the event of a national fallout disaster ? Anyone can join ; as long as you have perks that will benefit the clan . 
Anyone have a monitor/keyboard/mouse they don't use ? 
You know what I HATE !? When the spirals on your pads of notebook paper get intertwined . Which bends them . Which makes them more prone to intertwination later on . Which guarantees a sad future for me . 
I need some sushi really bad !! Wii Sports Resort is teasing me ! :( 
I made a my first pumpkin pie ! It'll turn out better next time . :D 
Youth group was fun ! Pictionary , Puzzles and Pizza . :D I still missed worship , though ... 
Finally got a moniter/keyboard/mouse , ( Thank you , < PROPMALE > ) and now all I need is a wifi card ! :D 
Linux looks fun to learn ! It will be like an adventure . :) 
It was just all < PROPFEMALE > and everything ! That's not fair ... :( 
I need to move to < PROPFEMALE > ... It's warm there , right ? 
Yay , I can FINALLY comment on stuff ( not to mention type much faster ) with this USB keyboard !!! \ 
:D 
I took a nap , but I still don't feel any better . My day was ok , but I was hoping for some fantastic blowout before school starts again . Oh well , I guess I'll just tie up the relaxed part of me and put it in the attic until next weekend . Except that will be my birthday weekend , but how can I complain about that ? \ 
\ 
:) 
I want it to be one of those gray early-summer mornings where I wake up for no reason , being the only one awake in the house , and have time to think about stuff ; but all my mornings will be spent at school for some time . :/ 
Who's all at my house for my birthday Friday-Saturday ? Feel free to invite yourselves , just let me know so I know what to plan for . 
It's national book week . The rules : grab the closest book to you , turn to < PROPFEMALE > 56 , post the 5th sentence as your status . Don't mention the title . Copy the rules as part of your status . \

For NOW ... My party will be scheduled for the 8th . 
It's odd not having math homework ; I almost LIKE doing my homework now . There's no algebra to solve ! :) 
I guess I should go home now . Goodbye , everyone ! :) 
A chalupa sounds good right about now . Or a gyro with cucumber sauce . 
I guess tater-tots and chicken tenders will suffice ... ;) 
Hm , strange ; there isn't anything suckish going on in my life right now ...
