I'm always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks me if \ 
I want to save any changes to my ten-page technical report that I swear I \ 
did not make any changes to . 
How many times is it appropriate to say \What ? \ " before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear or understand a word they said ? "

Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it

it's Diabetes Awareness Month . It isn't pink or sexy , it doesn't involve boobs , football players or cute t-shirts . It's about being grateful when you or your loved one wakes up in the morning . It's about 3am blood sugar checks , needles , low blood sugars and the smell of insulin on your ... hands after changing a pump site or filling a syringe . Thats a Diabetics LIFE . Repost if you love someone with Diabetes 
would love it if today miraculously turned out to be next Monday afternoon ... approximately about 8 pm would be wonderful ... 
Wishing heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today , but that's nothing new . I thought of you yesterday and days before too . I think of you in silence . I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame .... Repost this if you have someone in heaven that you miss on Earth 
... [[ Hmmm . why not ?! ]]Lets see who actually knows me ? FirstName : _______MiddleName : _______ Last Name : _______ Age : _____Birthday : __/___/___ BirthPlace : _______EyeColor : ____ Nickname : _______ FavoriteColors : ______ Bestfriend : _______ ...

I'm finding it so odd that I now understand a lot of the inuendos and issues behind and in movies that I watched when I was younger ( aka Indiana Jones ) All I have to say is wow ..... I never caught a lot of this stuff ... ignorance is truly bliss sometimes 
i feel like my brain is mush now that i have been studying anatomy all day 
in need of a job ... 
moderately frustrated about things out of my control ... 
life is full of changes ... just learning to roll with the punches and stand up and not roll over 
finally feelin better ! Hope it stays that way !

So I’m moving on , Letting go , Holding on to tomorrow\ 
I’ve always got the memories while I’m finding out who I’m gonna be 
is now convinced that we should all have our phones set to video record while there is all this snow on the ground , because people LIKE ME tend to bite it outside our dorms lol so comical !

where did the weekend go ? 
anyone else not happy about the teams goin to the Superbowl ?

feelin super stressed out right now ! 
My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores , go to church & school . They gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job and work for the things that I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school , at my job & to take pride in my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic & respect for the law , and my elders . I thank God everyday for my parents . Copy and paste if you had Mean parents too 
GO PACKERS !!!! 
I have to say it . I love my big ! She is the most amazing person I know !!!!!! I hope to be just like her ! 
some days you just feel like screaming !!!

Mama tellin ' me to drop some cash\ 
In the offering plate on Sunday\ 
And granddad sayin ' you can have a few\ 
But don't ever cross that line\ 
Yeah I hear voices all the time

Anatomy is causing me to have a mental breakdown right now !!!!! 
gets tired of people who are complete hypocrites and hide behind excuses ... 
stupid snow ...

I figured out why I'm fat ! The shampoo I use in the shower that runs down my body says \for extra volume and body\ " . I'm going to start using \ " Dawn\ " dish soap . It says \ " dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove\ " . Repost if you have the same issue "
