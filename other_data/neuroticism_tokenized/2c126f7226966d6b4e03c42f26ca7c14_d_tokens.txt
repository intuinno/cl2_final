Maybe time turning over will give me the incentive I need to mend things . 

\Santa won't come for you if you're a bad girl . Scooby doo will go away . Little bear will run away from home . Tinker < PROPFEMALE > and her freaky friends won't like you anymore . \ " Lol . " 
And surely that ain't right ... 
Uhg I hate when you go to play a song and you hear \LIVE FROM PROGRESSIVE while your online check out progressive today .... \ " screw you . I hate ads " 
But you doubt me , of course . Goddamn 
Hmm . Everyone is like , grow your hair out ! And I want to , but I don't have any < PROPFEMALE > . And I'm getting a mullet and I need a trim and layers and stuffffff : ( sooo looks like I'm getting a little cut .

I should follow my own advice 
Two steps forward . Don't hold me back . 
Science Daily , blah . Had to find like 5 articles before I could pick one out . But I guess they have insight into what causes chromosome problems during emrbryonic development . It's the cells aging , imagine that . Lol .

Is hungry , but doesn't feel much like eating : ( 
The worst thing about life is realising it really isn't in your hands , at all . 
Put a HUGE chunk into my project . Going to watch Splice , and resume . Leave me some love (: 
Yes < PROPMALE > , you are , in fact , a girl's toy . 
I could sleep forever . 
Is this where all of you saw yourselves a year ago ? tell me truthfully . 
Is ready to embrace her future , and leave the past behind . Kind of . 
I think it's the familiarity of you that's really bringing me down . 
freaking PHONE is dying . Grrrr , 
I think I'm spending too much time on the computer today ... I need to see some human faces . Interact with some people . 
Weep , weep ! 
Chips , chips , chips

loves life today . life is good . (: 
Is listening to Radiohead and eating twizzlers . (: Having a laid back night . 
Hates when she sees somebody like something and wants to unlike it for them , but can't . Same thing with comments on other people's statuses . Know what I mean ? 
thinks she's going to stop wearing shoes to school . there's nothing quite as liberating as bare feet 
He talks to me in human , but when he's a dog , now THAT'S another story . LOLLLLL < PROPFIRST > 
Zakk likes money so he can Get things he needs . Notice the capital Get . It's to emphasise his Getting . Lol . Go Get some , guys . 
You know I COULD read the first four chapters of Gulliver's Travels ... or maybe get some sleep .... blegh , 
Cold War Kids (: 
Kenai people ! December 18th is Veloceraptor Day . Read about it in my events thing . But basically I was thinking we should hold it in Wallmart , since we really don't have a legit mall !!!! And , uh , invite your friends . We need prey to hunt . 
Today's a day to remember the past , for family time . 
jigsaw falling into place 
I love Silversun Pickups (: 
Coffee and cream to keep you awake\ 
You sit and you stare like you're hallucinating\ 
If I could take you away and connect you to time\ 
Would your eyes light up and still recognize mine ? 
Is it the time of day , or is it just this week ? Is it you or is it me , or is this a disease , i wouldn't know , i'm not a doctor but i know the way i am ... 
I found you , Ms. Maggoo , get it together and bring it back to me 
But does it really matter what either of us thinks ? in the end , you're breaking yourself . 
loves being replaced . 
I love my friends (: haha . 
Tonight's the only night we're not afraid to let the whole world know we're wearing a mask . 
I won't lose my focus over you . 
And to think , you could take away everything I strove for , like that . 
don't take this from me , please . some things aren't necessary for survival . but this is 
stresssssseeeddddddd 
Is going to plunge forward with honesty and hope everything works out . 
Rage Against the Machinneeeeee (: 
Calm Like a Bomb . 
I need to live my life the way I choose , and place my own boundaries . Living a life of limited freedoms isn't good enough for me , and never will be . 
I'm sinking , again . 
In this town where people never change , I won't remain .. 
There's too much to look backward at , suddenly . 
Silversun Pickups (: 
Suddenly there's just too much time to kill , and too much solitude in which to do so . 
We live for the moments that make us feel alive . 
Wants to start a movement , because people have been standing still for far too long . 
Dude , did you know you can put asterisks before and after a word and it'll bold it !?!??!! 
I feel sort of disturbed , this morning . Wishing my dreams weren't so vivid 
Neon Trees , you always boost my mood (: 
Building nothing out of something . 
Blahhh , sick :( School and work tomorrow , sigh . 
Wants to push open time like an envelope , climb inside and mail herself to yesterday . 
The times are changing , oh , and so are we . 
To all of you whos names have become curse words in my mouth , I thank you for teaching me to hate and still have peace . 
Is homesick . 
\Why not ? No snugglejazzs ? \ " lol . " 
Attention Kenai peninsula kids ... everybody wish for school to be cancelled tomorrow on 11:11 tonight ! (: maybe if we all do it it'll come true . 
Mmmm , life . There are consequenses to things you didn't do . The things you should have done but didn't , and the things others were told you did that never happened . 
When will you understand that I do what I want ? 
I guess I'm avoiding the inevitable truth ... 
Mmm , still full after eating 6 hours ago . Damn . 
Really hates christmas . And the fact that it wasn't even thanksgiving before the holiday's decor came a caroling ... everywhere . I can't change the channel without hearing about rhudolf , and i can't check facebook without reading about < PROPFEMALE > . no offense mo , it's not just you (: 
Who would you spend the rest of your life with , given one week to live ? And how would you spend it ? 
Oh , can't anybody see we've got a war to fight ? 
Isn't sure about anything anymore , now that all that was certain is gone , except age and the progression of time . Are there plans to be made ? No , because there is too much to doubt , and too much to change . 
Mmmmm , I see right through you , and you know it . 
Is thinking she will TRY to go to sleep ... 
usyfgsy9fg7syfg7ywger7sg69f76wgef76dg ; fucking nikiski . someone get me out of here , 
SAT in the morningggg : / ahh ! I'm nervous . 
fleetwood mac <3 
dreading time , and yet yearning for it . dreading the ways I feel , and yet what would I do without them ? without time we cannot heal and cannot yearn . mmm , someday we'll all eat our words . 
My little bro might come visit me for christmas !!!! :DDDDDD 
All this time that's passed , and it's like I still can't believe the obvious . 
I'm tired of watching you live your life without me . I don't know what to do with myself , without you . So what to do ? Delete you from me ? 
Or , you could completely blow me off like I deserve NO respect and like I am not there at all . 
Listen to the wind blow , watch the sun rise . 
oh , dear . 
Mmmm , christmas break ! Gonna do some last minute shopping .... (: 
what to do what to do . 
It'll all work out , no matter what they say . 
homemade pizza , filming the eclipse and catching up with family . (: 
Oh , can't anybody see ? We've got a war to fight . 
Winter solstice . Gonna start getting light again now . (: 
A little apprehensive . 
( Give me a reason to love you ) 
I don't understand why it means nothing coming from you . 
Do you think they'd round an 89.3 on a semester grade up to a 90 ? Just wondering ... kind of hoping too . 
Dude . Go to account settings , then languages and set it to english(pirate ) . It changes all your menu things . 
Mmm , who we are . 
Even after a four hour nap , I still feel drained from the holidays . Oh well . Dinner time 
Ya'll didn't give her credit , cause she knows I would have let it happen . 
I never had a < PROPMALE > to say exactly what I meant .

Repost this if you're tired of every status in your news feed being a copy-paste about bullying , and if you know that copy-pasting a status isn't going to do anything about any cause .

Paperwork : / bleghhhhh 
Show tonight : p 
To all those heading out to the show tonight , \

The show was fun . Saw a lot of people I haven't seen in a while . I got a shirt (: (: (: 
I just realized I've gone all day wearing only one sock . \ 
Of course , I've only been up since 3 pm ... but , that IS 5 hours . \ 
hahahaha . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and mine's conversation :\ 
Me : \Word 
You're on my mind , (: 
It's a terrible thing to predict terrible events , about terribly , predictably , unpredictable people . 
Have you gone and left again ? 
Same shit , different day . 
< PROPFEMALE > Dewilde : I thought of some interesting uses for the never ending purse . As well as bingo dobbers and loose change , there should be a little compartment carrying a plastic fork , spoon and knife set , as well as sauces from various restaurants . 
Is very , very , very thankful for family . 
Whatever , I have other priorities . 
Just made a BEAUTIFUL stir-fry to put over the top of some quinoa . Yum ! 
Spontanious Anchorage trip ftw ! 
Memories , like fingerprints , are slowely raising . 
My head and my heart shared a toast , shook hands , and parted ways again . Curious how we can never stay in one place ...? 
(:
