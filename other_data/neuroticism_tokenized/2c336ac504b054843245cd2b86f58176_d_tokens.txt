misses camp . * sadface * 

misses her < PROPFEMALE > <3 
feels like an only child . For the first time in her life . 
is dancing in the rain . 
prefers bruises to floor burn ... 
is thankful for Jesus . And puppies . And sunshine . 
Has a nephew !!! Yay baby Wagler ! 
It's odd , when you live where tans are worshipped ... to suddenly become a novelty for your pale skin 
There's something magical about the first fireflies of Summer ... 
I love you , < PROPFEMALE > Wagler . 
With my whole heart have I sought thee : Oh let me not wander from thy commandments . \ 
Ps . 119:10 
O August rainshowers , how I do love thee ... 
I love you , September . 
Had a splendiforous birthday . Thanks guys !!! 
is trompsing through the snowdrifts ... And dreaming of April . 
is filling the unforgiving minute ... With sixty seconds ' worth of distance run ... 
One small spark of originality ... 
Can jump again . Legally . 
Tehe . Scratch the last status . See Job 13:15 .
