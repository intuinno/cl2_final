Really missing < PROPMALE > today . He's been on my heart a lot lately and I feel weird going on with such normal everyday life . I feel like we're all going to a party and < PROPMALE > t wasn't invited . I feel like to be a good person I should leave . But life doesn't work like that ... 

Finally got Garretts blue gauges in ! Stopping here ! Content with the current pain . 
Decided to start saving for a car ... long process im seeing . growing up sucks ! 
Found out I need to be able to drive myself to OC next year ! Decided to start saving for a car ... long process Im seeing . Hopefully i make it by september ! stresssssss ! ugh . 
Still stressing about the car situation ... have no idea what I am going to doooooo ! ugh . 
Had a great weekend !! Tomorrow is < PROPFIRST>'s Birthday !! yay ! 
Excited to see < PROPMALE > tonight ! Missing < PROPFIRST > a tonnnn !

California with < PROPFIRST > in 3 Days !!! < PROPFIRST > Mayer Tomorrow !! 
Saw < PROPFIRST > Mayer last night . It was wonderful . He is amazing , sounding and looking ! ;] 
Cali trip canceled :[ Attending Easter afterall . :] 
Thinking that I might take my drive test this weekend ... Luckily I can take it multiple times , so its worth a shot I guess ! :] 
< PROPMALE>'s coming home today ! 
My doe-doe just left for Portland . :[ I got so used to having him around this week ! 
is kind of in a weird mood this morning . Frusterated with ... life I guess . 
Feeling a little better than earlier . Really bummed that < PROPMALE > won't be at the fourth though . Not sure I want to go through it without him ... but we all have to do things we don't want . If I don't face it this year , I'll have to next year . Luckily I have an extremely supportive and awesome family ! 
Feeling good :] Going to see < PROPFIRST>'s Lacrosse game today with Mdogg haha :] 
Got lots of extra hours at work this week ! woo hoo ! $$$ haha 
Work pretty much sucked today , but a combination of 3 HUGE dinner parties , plus extra tables , 1 cook , 1 angry boss , 1 waitress and a butt load of PMS will do that to you I guess . haha :] 
Single . Doing Fine . Don't ask :] 
Who on earth is < PROPFEMALE > pears ... and why is she on my friends list ?! 
Why do snails have shells ? They arent very hard and they don't really do much in the way of protection ... 
Taking my drive test tomorrow !!

Just realized I'm a week ahead in math haha :] sickkkk 
Loves having her license ! no more missing dance on mondays ! yuuussss . :D 
If everyone thought that they themselves were too small to make a difference , no differences would be made . Picture a world without poverty , rape , crime , neglect , abuse , disease , drugs . Think of how great it could be for YOU . See what you get out of helping others ? If everyone saw that , I doubt we would have any of the fore mentioned issues ... 
is seriously considering joining the Peace Corps when I graduate . Orphanages in Ghana , Cape Town , Uganda , < PROPFEMALE > , and most of Africa are largely understaffed . What are YOU doing to help ? 
is confused as to what the binomial therom has to do with statistics and why I must learn it . 
Counting down the days until summer ! 
Feeling Glum ... 
Very disturbed by Lady Gaga's current performance on Americal Idol ... 
Where do I aim when I shoot the breeze , I need a simply kind of lovely and the thought is just a novalty :] 
Bed time :]

The very first bomb dropped by the Allies on Berlin during World War II killed the only elephant in the Berlin Zoo ... sad much ?!

Happy birthday < PROPMALE > ! 
Ah a perfect day to lay out in the sun with some tunes and a good book :) 
Oh the all too familiar pains of summer .. the dreaded sunburn . 
I saw someone today in the car behind me that looked exactly like him . I still haven't grasped it . I have these dreams that it is him in the car behind me and he's like \Hey nice tattoo ! Whats it for ? \ " and I say \ " We thought we'd lost you .. \ " I wake up feeling amazing . Does that mean I've completely lost it ? " 
Ah only one day off this week . I guess its a good thing though ! $$$$ 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are here ! yay ! :) 
Have my nephew for the week :) hes such a cutie patootie !

\Children's talent to endure stems from their ignorance of alternatives . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Angelou " 
Favorite Geico Commercial of all time : Hey you dang woodchucks ! Quit chuckin ' my wood ! 
My parents are watching Inception . I have chosen not to partake in the viewing as a cautionary measure in order to keep my consciousness intact and un-\extracted \"..." 
Im thinking about lightening up my hairrrr . My natural blonde seems dimmer every day ... 
that math class blew my gpa this quarter . UGH . I need to get all A's next qaurter . 
Today has been uneventful . Probably wont get off till 1 AM again tonight . Back to back late nights are no fun . Making money is hard ... 
Watching < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > play Halo ... wow what a night haha 
I've got a gnarly case of the holiday blues ... 
Whats the most logical cure for the holiday blues ? A 3 day get away with my best friend . Thats what . 
Ah its < PROPFEMALE > city here . I like it :) 
My hair is unmistakably blonde as it used to be . :) Yahooooo ! 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ! Woo Hooooo !

Most stressful day ever . 2 hour commute each way for one 50 minute class . Waste of time ? Possibley . 
Today is not turning out well , yet again . 
I hate feeling sick . :/ 
Offically have my own car <3 !!! 
Could the weather be any more disgusting ? 
Going to the mall with < PROPFIRST > <3 Then dinner at < PROPFIRST>'s! Today should be great :) 
Today has been nothing but homework and MTV ... rather productive , I'd say . 
Was having a pretty great day , and then math came into the picture . ohhh bother ... 
And the job hunt begins ... 
I hate forgetting about assignments until 2 days before they're due ... 
Researchingt the education of deaf prechoolers is a whole lot harder than had anticipated ... Maybe I should go broader ... 
This ASL project is proving to be a real pain in my butt ... 
Just did a 2 < PROPFEMALE > research paper , powerpoint , oral presentation and bibliography in one sitting . Gotta love college , man . So happy to be done ! 
I strongly disagree with all those hating on the Black Eyed Peas halftime show .. I thought it was possibly the best halftime show in ages ... So the sound quality wasn't great . Its a HUGE stadium and FERGIE . What were you expecting ? 
And I gotta say , Today was a good day . 
Got called back by Payless today . But it wasn't the one i applied for . It was in Silverdale . It SUCKS to turn down a job when you really want one , even if you would be paying more in gas than youd make in day ... 
Today I made a impulsive decision on donated 16 inches of my hair . 
The only upside so far to being in college is that I'm getting very efficient at homework ... I've been cruising through this stuff . 
Keep drinking coffee , stare me down across the table . So many things I would say if I were about , but I keep quiet and count the cars that pass by . I <3 this song .. 
Today's accomplishments : Checked out and read a full book , wrote a report on it , wrote up a 500 word paper for yoga , wrote a 300 word paper for ASL , did half my math homework and half my math project . I feel so accomplished . 
I wish it was so gosh darn cold . I can't wait to be laying a beach in Belize getting a rockin sunburn . 
My big brother and sister should be here soon ! And my darling Junebug !! This weekend has promise .. 
Today's going good :) School was quick and painless and the weather isnt terrible ! woo ! 
I just realized I have never seen < PROPFEMALE > . Maybe 5 minutes of it here and there , but my attention span was so short when I was little , I never really saw the movie ... 
Theres a reason you don't have to do stupid portfolio garbage in college . YOU DON'T HAVE TIME . Stupid stupid stuff ... 
So glad I < PROPMALE > in there at my job . Today , was informed that I am being promoted from bus girl to legit waitress ! :D 
\Why isn't he turning around ?! \ " \ " The prius is virtually silent if he keeps it under 5 mph ... \ " < PROPMALE > proceeds to slowly smash < PROPMALE > into the fence ... Favorite Office moment ... " 
Why can't this darn weather make up its mind ?! :/ Its really quite confusing ... 
You know you're in college when you have a 5 < PROPFEMALE > research paper due monday and you know that starting it on Saturday will allow you plenty of time . Even though you have yet to start the research . I remember the days when the thought of writing a 2 < PROPFEMALE > paper in a month terrified me . 
It went from rain to hail to blue skies and < PROPFEMALE > in ten minutes .. What on earth ... 
Way too much driving today . Burley and back . OC and back . Burley and back again . Now out to Belfair . The poor little hamsters on wheels running my car are going to be exhausted by tonight .
