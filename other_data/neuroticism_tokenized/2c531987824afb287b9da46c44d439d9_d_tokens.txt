I love being a mom . I have great kids . My girl child sang in the All State Chorus tonight . It was marvelous . My boy child is so excited about me registering him for IB . Isn't life grand ? 

I got my 30 year high school reunion packet last week so I have been reconnecting with old friends . How time flies when you are growing old . 
Happy mothers day all you mothers out there . 
My kids are great . My daughter with her new license , got up this morning and went out to get me coffee and donuts from Dunkin Donuts . She left while I was still asleep and my momdar did not even go off . She got home as I was waking up and she and my son brought me breakfast in bed . What a wonderful morning with wonderful kids . 
My AC is working and I am beginning to cool off . Thank the lord . 
To all my friends and family , Jewish and otherwise , wishing you a Shanah Tovah Um'tukah . 
Yesterday was PHUHS first Debate of the year . It took a lot of effort to make it happen , but in the end it was a successful day . But for the wonderful and gracious Mr. < PROPFIRST > Morzenti , we would not have had an opportunity to participate in this event . \ 
\ 
I am proud of the whole team , but I am most proud of my own 2 kids . \ 
See you all at the next debate . 
As an explanation , PHUHS has 3 forms of debate . Policy , also called Team Debate , teams of 2 students complete against another team of 2 students to debate a chosen issue . Lincoln/Douglas also known as LD which is 1 student against 1 student debating a chosen issue , and Congress which is a room of 20-30 students debating topics that are submitted in the form of bills or resolutions by the students . 
At this debate , 5 teams attended 2 Varsity and 3 Novice . < PROPFIRST > Ross/ < PROPFIRST > Urchick Varsity Debaters were awarded 3rd place . Zaydi and Zayna Javeed Novice Debaters were awarded 2nd place . < PROPFEMALE > Polur/Lillie Cohen the other Varsity Debate Team forfeited due to illness . < PROPFEMALE > Valletti/Jadzia Braccamonte and Hammad Huda/Mohamed Nuh also competed as novice teams . Congratulations to all Policy Teams .
