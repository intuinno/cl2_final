My baby turns 21 today !! Aside from making me feel VERY OLD , I'm so relieved that he can now LEGALLY consume alcohol and that he hasn't made me a grandmother yet ! I'm not ready for that title ... 

I'm FINALLY moving back to my old office and it's LONG OVERDUE !!!! GOOD_BYE NEGATIVE ENERGY and BAD MEMORIES !! 
I really gotta start putting some Air Force stuff on this wall ... I can't help it though , I love my Marines . 
<3 <3 <3 
the stupid fire alarm is going off in my building , I am stuck outside in my PJ's and slippers !! 
got a new job ! :-) 
Thank you everybody !!! 40 degrees today ... tropical ! 
BTW , I would much rather be 42 than < PROPFEMALE > Aguilara today , her performance last night screams Saturday Night Live ! 
Thank you everybody for all the Birthday wishes ... the older you get the more you appreciate them and the people that send them !! ;-) 
I've had a rough week and need a taste of home , its times like these I really miss KC where BBQ is the 1st language and the English language is optional .
