Jerking is pointless . It'd be easier if bboying took over the world and made hiphop rule again . >:] and i'm expecting it to happen : it's just a matter of teaching the ignorant 

If I ever happen to run into a jerker ... With either my Bibliophile power , Keyboardist power , or both , i will attack relentlessly with Books , Keyboards , and Piano Books 
everybody hates koreans cuz we have kimchi o.o 
not really feeling like talking anymore to some people ... it's getting worse day by day .

think think think think * brzzap ! * dead brain 
lifehouse addict ... 
Going off the deepend ? I'll just throw myself right off it instead =_= 
dreaming of rain 
dreaming , just dreaming of light and crystals ... The sound of breezes upon the waves , the rippling of still waters , and the sound of waves upon the still shores ... 
tired beyond physical tiredness ... mentally tired and worn out as well 
nervous breakdown ... depression + hyperventilation + anxiety ?... really don't feel well in the head 
so tired ?.... 
Studying my life away is so boring ... I want to get away from it all and just relax and read whatever I want to- Who honestly spends all day willingly studying ? 
I have finally finished ... reading all the books in my library- now it's time to start ordering books from all the other libraries >:3

Mercy Me and Casting Crowns :] 
Mercy Me , Casting Crowns , and Tenth Avenue North !! 
kicked out of cross country .. 
why on earth does my calc teacher not know how to teach ? =_= this is so stupid 
eyes are the windows to the soul people tell me . So how is it that when people look into my eyes , they find I have none ? Dead eyes and blank face ; how well they mask the truth =_= 
mm ... for those some people who aren't in koyfmans ' class ... i guess i'll just scan and upload em for u pplz 
school got so depressing :( 
my eyes are so very tired and in need of rest 
whee ~ ~ my eyes are currently at 1000 degrees , but since i haven't seen an eye doctor in months , and my vision actually IS deteriorating , i feel i have the evidence to say that my eyes are now OVER 1000 degrees 
i hate it when people avoid me , it gives me the creeps e___e ... it's been happening a bit much for it to be normal o.o \ 
or maybe it's just < PROPFEMALE > ?.. 
i play AUDIOSURF when i'm bored :D its so awesome 
people who watch/ed house ~ of the original cast , who would you be ?! 
my priorities come in this order .. \ 
church > friends > health > school\ 
who thinks that i'm insane , or anything's wrong with that ? 
i love music that i can listen to over and over again that is really restful and amazing 
dreaming is hard work these days 
these days i have to wonder what my life is coming to . i'm not on terms with so many things , totally on top of others . my life is spinning way out of control 
RENT .

such a depressing time of year ... this time that we know so well ... it makes me wonder about everything . 
stupid parents and their INTERNET ADDICTION . 6+ HOURS ON THE COMPUTER INTERNET ADDICTION . 6+ HOURS STREAMING KOREAN DRAMAS ON THE COMPUTER INTERNET ADDICTION . 6+ HOURS STREAMING KOREAN DRAMAS THAT KILL MY INTERNET INTERNET ADDICTION 
listening to hours and hours of lectures and taking notes :D i love it ~ 
looking for specific books in my home is literally like trying to find a needle in a haystack 
I'm tired of the shadows . Being in the dark is isolating and forbidding . Knowing otherwise is the only way to survive and clearly live . I must be brought to light and bring to light what I do not understand . But how shall I attain , discover , such a position ? We shall see in the times to come . 
I'm tired of the way things are going . I feel like i'm only fighting an uphill war 
people , as a favor to me ~ go through my most recent 2 notes and tell me what you think ? good or bad , just as a favor- I find them interesting , and I want to know what you guys think 
i feel like there's a wall between me and the people I want to talk to . The sad part is , they're not my walls . I'm being kept out . 
i hate my life -_- 
First , do no harm . 
SAT's TOMORROW ... WISH ME LUCK ! 
why on earth do grades even exist ? Education is for \pursuit of knowledge\ " since when did it become \ " pit people against each other and see who survives through it ? \ " There is a contradictory belief that exists there " 
how do i make a choice between different parts of self ? 
I NEED MORE BOOKS . MORE LITERATURE . MORE TIME ON MY HANDS TO READ 
Caught mid-range between my two traditions , where one attitude often clashed with the other and one technique of playing was by the other opposed , I caused whole blocks of people to suffer . \ 
\ 
- < PROPMALE > Ellison , Living with Music 
why is the Southern California Library Branch Connection's book collection so pathetic ? It doesn't have more than enough books to satisfy my < PROPFEMALE > for more books to devour ... 
Everything happens for a reason . No matter what it is , when it is- everything , every single thing happens for a reason . 
\there goes my pain\ 
analyzing english lit isn't that bad : 0 it's more fun than i gave it credit for 
the more i < PROPMALE > after something , the further away it gets from me ... 
i am the one who says over and over , \I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry\ " in a litany that almost never ends ... when will that stop ? " 
programming my calc is actually not that bad o___o 
cavities D: 
don't disregard the weight of words . No matter how lighthearted they seem , there is thought behind them . 
We all wonder what's wrong . with ourselves ; with what we're doing ; with other people ; with life ; with the universe . And time slows to a stop . We want to get it moving again . But how ? and why ? because the only life worth living is one lived . 
I shut the door and closed the shutters . The only light that springs forth now is the sole candleflame from the attic .... 
honestly , i would be proud to call myself Quasimodo . Odd name , indeed , but as with anything else , there's more to life than what meets the eye . 
time to power-review . power-study ? maybe a little bit of both -_- 
TIME TO WRITE ALL THE NOTES . < PROPFIRST > I'M SORRY BUT I'M USING SIZE 1 FONT 
donating blood is very tiring o__o 
the ability to compartmentalize ... and the fact that I'm doing so now ... \ 
is that really healthy ? 
dropping IB makes me feel relaxed and happy 
Everyone has to say goodbye sometime . Some don't mind the loss . Some can't accept it . Some try to deny it . As time passes , no one can go by without experiencing it . We run to hold on while we can . Eventually , we let go . Because we're lost . Because we can't go on . Because we get pushed aside . The fact still remains- we all part ways . The only question is : how do I let go , knowing that those people are so dear to me ? 
is it abnormal for me to be able to relate to Holden from Catcher in the Rye ? Because that's how i feel . Just like Holden . 
something's wrong when i'm afraid to say hi to people . \ 
But I am\ 
i can only wonder why 
all the time i have left\ 
is flooding away . \ 
where did it all go ? \ 
flying away on wings 
< PROPFEMALE > Dei , qui tollis peccata mundi , miserere nobis . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Dei , qui tollis peccata mundi , < PROPFEMALE > nobis pacem . \ 
Dominus Deus exaudi nos et miserere exaudi , Dominus\ 
< PROPFEMALE > nobis pacem et salva nos a hostibus \ 
Salva nos , Deus\ 
Sanctus , < PROPFEMALE > , Kyrie , fons bonitatis . \ 
Kyrie , ignis divine , eleison . 
either it's really cool or really lame that my eyes are bad enough that i can apply for a handicap card when i drive -_-
