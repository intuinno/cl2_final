Having a broken leg is VERRRRRRY boring . 
Off to surgery for a < PROPMALE > in my tibia , should be in the hospitial for a few days . Will keep you updated . 
Being released from the hospitial with pain killers , a boot , and a < PROPMALE > . At least I can go home . 
< PROPFEMALE > Arakawa ( 9 news ) is a very wonderful woman .

Has anyone else seen '' True Nature'' ? Wow , great film . If you love drama , thriller , and a l'il horror SEE THIS !! 
Eveyone is inheretly good . We need to believe this , as we well should . Most , if not most of the all , are great people . Don't be stupid , but don't be hatefull either . How many of you have been hopefull on a path ? 
That's just my opinion , I may be wrong .
