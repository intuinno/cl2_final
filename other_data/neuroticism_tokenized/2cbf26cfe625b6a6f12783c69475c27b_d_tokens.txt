People need to understand that children with\ 
special needs don't have an illness , there is no cure & it's not\ 
contagious . They only want what we want , to be accepted . 93% of you probably\ 
won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status\ 
for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in \ 
honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding .
