So I didn't think this could actually happen ... but I got stalked by a creep at disneyland . First , behind us in line for thunder mountain , then behind us in line for Tower of Terror , then I caught him walking behind me later on . 
I think there is a < PROPFEMALE > living in the planter infront of my house . I saw it today and when I looked in the bushes it was gone ..... strange .

I'm finally home after being at the beach all week :) It's been a great spring break let me tell you . 
This week has been perfect ... but I must say its making we want summer to hurry up and get here . Spring break is a tease . 
So I got accepted to AMDA :) 
Should I go to AMDA ( American Musical and Dramatic Academy ) OR Fullerton College .... I've got 5 days to decide . Any thoughts ? 
I'm so close to finally choosing a college . SO close . 
And this is when I start to regret procrastinating .... and begin to dislike senior projects . 
YES , ladies and gentleman I have my drivers test this friday . You'll see me driving the streets in no time . 
frustration . sucks . 
Ladies and Gentlemen : < PROPFIRST > Newman can drive now . Thank you to all who chauffeured us in the past . There will ( hopefully ) be no need for your assistance any longer :) 
I love waking up to a cold . agh . 
My bad morning just turned around into the making of an amazing day :) 
We create our own reality by our thoughts and the way we perceive the world . 
the clock is always ticking and time running out . so < PROPFEMALE > each moment and never doubt . 
I am so done with school ... and ready for the weekend . 
Got a haircut :) And rocking a middle part . 
PROM is tomorrow :) I'm beyond excited . 
I'm never thought I'd have to say this ... but my senior project speech is too long ? lol . 
Oh yeah ... public speaking is my forte ..... duhhh .... 
Pride makes us artificial and humility makes us real . 
Disneyland with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > O'Connell and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . It's going to be a good night :) 
Watch your thoughts , for they become words . \ 
Watch your words , for they become actions . \ 
Watch your actions , for they become habits . \ 
Watch your habits , for they become character . \ 
Watch your character , for it becomes your < PROPFEMALE > . 
Everything happens for a reason . 
I need a job ... ideas anyone ? 
< PROPMALE > mis callbacks today ! 
my last week of highschool is this week .... its surreal . 
Thespian banquet tonight :) Hopefully i wont cry .... 
I finally have my license !!!! freedom is mine . 
Today was a blur . I cannot believe I'm done with highschool ... and that I'm nineteen . Time flies . 
Saying goodbye to the El Dorado stage tonight . I'm going to miss that theater and the wonderful memories I made there . 
Every end is a new beginning . 
I've imagined what this day would be like my whole life .... today I graduate from highschool . It's strange . 
Learn from yesterday , live for today , hope for tomorrow . 
You never know what it's like .... until it happens to you . 
Looks like I will be buying myself a macbook soon :) heck yes . 
Things might be looking up again :) 
If you focus on what you have , you will end up having more . If you focus on what you lack , youll never have enough . 
Who else has a sore thoat ? 
Going to disneyland in the fouth of july weekend craziness with Summer Equitz . Wish me luck :) lol .

It's one of those days when I wish I had a pool . I would kill to go swimming right now . ahhhhh . 
My feet hurt :( Character shoes were not made for people with arched feet . This is a fact . 
My dads car is officially MINE :) wooo ! 
For everything you have missed , you have gained something else , and for everything you gain , you lose something else . 
I want to see < PROPMALE > Potter . SO badly . 
I don't understand tumblr . It's a strange new world very unlike facebook . 
The song is ended , but the < PROPFEMALE > lingers on . 
I get my wisdom teeth out today ... aghh . 
Now I can say I have not four , but five beautiful nieces :) 
I really dont like pain . :( My mouth is killing me . 
Living is easy with eyes closed , misunderstanding all you see . 
All of you are crazy . < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 was brilliant . 
Picking blackberries and going on a walk by myself ? Best part of my day hands down . 
Many of us runaway from who we are rather than finding ourselves . 
Eh I'm kind of done with our galaxy . Lets all move to Andromeda . 
Knowlwoods & Captain < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > O'Connell :) it's bound to be a good night . 
I'm starting to freak out . My registration date for FC is on the 3rd .... there are going to be no classes left that I want to take . 
chipotle for dinner ? heck yes . 
I'm typing this from my new macbook pro :) ... After spending an hour at the apple store having my mom becoming best friends/hooking me up with the worker helping us . lol Pretty embarrassing . He told us he was a pianist majoring in music at biola ... and he happened to be cute ... so I was fine with it . Sometimes I love my mom for the things she does . 
\As soon as you stop wanting something 
Well ... I got my first parking violation at fullerton college . No head out parking allowed apparently . lol . I've been parking in that parking lot ALL SUMMER and have never noticed those small little signs with the small font . Grr .

Age : 7\

What I thought was cool : Playing tag with the boys at recess & being in the talent show at school every year . \ 
Something good that came out of it : Ummm I'm not sure about the playing tag thing but .... because I was in the talent show every year I was never afraid of performing onstage as a kid . \

The Shawshank Redemption . Go rent it ... it was seriously one of the greatest movies I have ever seen . 
That awkward moment when you forgot you knocked down the trash cans with your car last night and see random pieces of trash you forgot to pick up scattered across your lawn . 
Look at the stars look how they shine for you . 
My car has been making REALLY strange noises lately .... so now I blast Radiohead in my car every time I drive in order to cover it up . It works like a charm . 
Whatever you want in life , start today . \ 
Not tomorrow - today . \ 
Let it be a small beginning - a < PROPFEMALE > beginning . \ 
Your happiness depends on starting today - every day . \

My 8 o'clock theory class was cancelled :) yay for college ! 
Pasta for breakfast ? heck yes . 
the best things in life are the simplest things . 
I just finished watching Pleasantville . I love that movie . Go watch it . 
I saw the movie Contagious last night and woke up with a cold ... 
Harmonizing with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > on youtube ? So fun . He's currently my dream duet partner . Most definitely . 
My neighbor apparently thinks that its necessary to use his leaf blower at 7:53 at night ... and then a couple times during the day . Thats hard core front yard dedication right there . 
I love Disneyland & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > O'Connell . There's nothing like hanging out with your best friend at the happiest place on earth :) 
My parents are watching some educational animal show in the other room .... and I can hear my mom talking to the tv trying to talk sense to the wild animals in africa asking them \share\ " their food . Iol . " 
I'm wearing my Starmites cast shirt to bed :) Oh the highschool memories . 
Today turned into a nightmare . Please pray for me . 
Why pursue happiness , when you can create it now ? 
I'm thinking about putting some of my artwork on etsy to sell ... thoughts ? 
So my parents just scared me to death blasting the surround sound while watching tv . The volume is so loud that our kitchen started shaking from the sound waves . I literally thought we were having an earthquake or something .
