more from Ayn Rand July 1974-It is at a time like this , in the face of an approaching economic collapse , that the intellectuals are preaching egalitarian notions . When the curtailment of gov spending is impeative , they demand more welfare projects . When the need for men of productive ability is deperate , they demand more equality for the incompetents . 
more Ayn Rand July 1974-Is there hope for the future of this country ? Yes , there is . This country has one asst left ; the matchless productive ability of its people . We must reveal to this counrty the secret that they are trying so hard to cover up-the miraculous productive system is CAPITALISM . ( Not the gov-not the unions-)
