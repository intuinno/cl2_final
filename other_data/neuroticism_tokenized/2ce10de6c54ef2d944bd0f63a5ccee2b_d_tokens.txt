REMEMBER WHEN .. \ 
getting HiGH meant swinging at a playground ? \ 
the worst thing you could get from a boy was c0otiEs ? \ 
' m 0 m ' ( was your hero)\ 
and ' D a D ' was the boy you were gonna marry ? \ 
when your W0RST ENEMiES were your siblings\ 
and rAcE iSsuEs were about who ran fastest ? \ 
when - WAR- was a card game\ 
and life was simple and care free ? \ 
remember when all you wanted to do\ 
WAS GROW UP ? 
God made man , and then he said , \I can do better than that 
When you’re down I may not be able to pick you back up , but I promise I’ll be willing to lay down right next to you .

Don't worry people , if we all die in 2012 , < PROPFIRST > Bieber dies with us . ( The good thing ? You can take this the good way or the bad way . ) 
Those who criticize our generation FORGOT who raised it ... 
Sometimes I really do miss being a little kid . Back then we fall down and got skinned knees . They really hurt less than broken hearts ... 
I want a guy ... \ 
Who would shove ice cream in my face when I tease him too much and laughs\ 
\ 
Who would wrestle with me , and tries his best\ 
Who shows me off to anyone and everyone\ 
Who treats me with the respect that I deserve\ 
Who will call me at four in the morning because he can't stop thinking about me ... \ 
Who sings to me , even if he's shy\ 
Who could break my heart\ 
But would never dream of it 
Piglet : \How do you spell LOVE ? \ " \ 
If the crown fits , FLAUNT it . 
Please don't take this the wrong way , but shut up . 
Do things with passion or not at all . Wherever you go , go with all your heart . 
GL[amour ] 
The greatest revenge is to accomplish what others told you that you could not do . \ 
SO GO OUT AND DO IT ! 
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes , saying - OMG ARE YOU OKAY ? Wow sorry dude , didn't mean to hit you ... \ 
( WARNING : Don't imitate songs in real life , for example , see dynamite ) :D

When life gives you BAD ROMANCE , show your POKER FACE , buy a new TELEPHONE , call < PROPMALE > and JUST DANCE . 
I'm going to be up all night today , fighting demons . 
Cried till my eyes hurt , but we'll be fine :D 
I hate the \like my status blahblahblah\ " crap because ... \ 
Today I heard this boy say \I need to gain weight because I don't want to go on a date with a girl and make her feel fat . \ " Good to know that boys these days are SOOOO thoughtful . \ 
I hope that every single one of us would not forget about these two years ' worth of happy memories . Don't dwell on the unpleasant one and let yourself remember all the joys and fun that we had together . 
I WANT TO STOP CRYING MY EYEBALLS OFF !! :( 
Like my status and I'll tell you what I LOVE about you . Priority to all THOOWANLING-ners <3 Because THIS class pwns EVERYONE ELSE !! Next in line is ArtClubbers <3 
Never take someone's feelings as a joke , you never know how much it f*cking hurts . \ 
-Unknown 
Some guy : Today this girl came to my class and shouted , \I want to be a dinosaur ! \ " . I had recently learnt that if you tie your belt around your arm you can look like a t-rex . My teacher's expression was priceless when I took off my belt and said 
I FEEL LIKE CRYING COS FACEBOOK REFUSE TO CHANGE MY NAME TO \STELLA THOOWANLING LIANG\ " . NOW I'M SAD D: " 
Apparently you can only change your name 5 times D: And I've reached my limit . \

Just because I'm there for you all the time , it doesn't mean that you can take me for granted . 
A conversation goes like this :\ 
Friend : \I LOVE EMINEM !! \ " \ 
Life is like a movie , except you can't pick your genre . 
U smile , I smile . U cry , I cry harder . You jump off the bridge , I'll bring roses to your funeral . Cheers , < PROPFIRST > Bieber . 
The truth is , everyone's gonna hurt you , you just gotta find someone who is worth suffering for . 
If you want her back , either tell her , or better yet , shut up and cry yourself to sleep like everybody else . 
\Men should grow up\ " \ 
Are you f***ing serious ?! It's nearing midnight and my ishuffle's charger goes missing ?!? \ 
I hate you life !! 
Medically speaking , you're adorable :)

Okay , so here everyone is rounding up their confirmed friends like a light bulb attracting all the fireflies ! And some are also scaring people away at the same time , haha . 307 sounds like the next big thing ... oh wait , it WILL be the next big thing ! Rawrrr . 
With a new year comes a brand new beginning . It's time to reflect on your year , and on the happy memories that you shared with your friends and loved ones . Don't dwell on the unhappy things , for you don't want to bring them into the new year . Focus on the happiness that you've had with everyone , and focus on bringing it to 2011 . It's a new year , you'll have all the time you need to create more happy memories <3

Boys are like purses : cute , full of crap , and always replaceable 
Boys are like Slinky's , useless , but fun to watch fall down the stairs .

Keep calm ... and kick some asses . 
Dear tummy , \ 
Sorry for the butterflies recently . I swear it's not my fault . 
BElieve in \

Sometimes we put up walls ... \ 
Not to keep people out , but to see who cares enough to knock ' em down . 
So I'll do as I please , and I'll lie through my teeth . Someone will get hurt , but it won't be me . 
If people are trying to bring you down , it means that you are above them .

There's a lot wrong with the world you live in . 
First dynamite , then firework , now it's grenade ... what's next , nuclear bomb ? 
Keep calm and kill zombies . 
Gravity doesn't mean too much too much to me . 
1 universe , 9 planets , 204 countries , 809 islands , 7 seas , and I had the privilege to meet you . 
What doesn't kill you makes you wish you did . 
Just gonna stand there and hear me roar . That's alright because I'm a dinosaur .

I still eat my pocky , even though things are rocky . \

You killed what was left of the good in me ... 
Shut the hell up , you are beautiful . 
Sometimes you love someone so much , you'd do anything for them . The rare times when you love someone so much , you would leave them . 
I have to go to sleep now , since I'm done mugging . Good luck everyone else , I <3 you guys anyways . 
Decided against sleeping , so I'm working on a sketch of Russia instead ... \
