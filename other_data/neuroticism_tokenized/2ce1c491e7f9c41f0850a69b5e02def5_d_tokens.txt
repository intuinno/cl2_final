I AM AT MEGACON RIGHT NOW ! YEAH !!! 
YEAH ! DAY 2 OF MEGACON BEGINS ! 
Not going to school tomorrow , I've been sick all week and I've gone to school every day over important stuff , I just don't care about tomorrow . 
Remembering why I hate Slipknot so much and how Mudvayne is far superior . 
I JUST DONATED BLOOD EARLIER TODAY ! I ALSO PASSED OUT DURING THE FIRST PINT ! :D I forgot to eat ! THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME SERIOUSLY PASSING OUT ! IT WAS AMAZING ! 
Learning Frankenstein on the guitar , hoping to learn the keyboard parts too of course . 
This has to be the worst possible 24 hours imaginable . 
Oh my , can't sleep ... Life's been so vibrant and fun for me recently . 
I feel much happier today than earlier days . Jazz Band must have seriously helped . That and the 3rd ID Jazz band too ... 
I fucking woke up at the exact same damn time as yesterday morning 3:00 . Really hoped I'd make it through tonight . 
Totally pushing a car out in glenville . Awesome day ! 
I just realized , for the past 5 years I've had the best moments of my life happen in april . This year was the first year I've had one of the worst in April . 
What would < PROPFIRST > Boitano do in this situation ? 
I feel better now for some reason , at least the anxiety is gone . 
Awww , same thing as Monday and Tuesday , only at 4:30 this time . 
Aparently .. Lady Gaga Amputated her leg as a fucking fashion statement . Please tell me this isn't true . 
My cat's giving birth to kittens , the first one looks dead so far . 
Heading to < PROPFEMALE>'s house I guess . 
Yeah , regret going over to < PROPFEMALE>'s house . I got to learn a lot about Black Holes though . 
I really like Orphaned Land .. Their album \The Beloved's Cry\ " is so nice and doom-metally . " 
lol . Posting from weight training . 
Off to bother that one person who I don't know . 
AP exam tomorrow , reading over those practice tests that Wisner gave me yesterday ... I was at first going to settle for a 4 but once I saw how important th multiple choice was , I'm getting a 5 . \ 
\ 
I am guaranteed a 3 ( seeing as how I scored a 3 with just the multiple test ) so I want a 5 damn it ! Revisiting everything on the paper .. 
Ugh , I scored a 67.75 on my practice test at home . And here I was hoping for more than a 1.75 point improvement . Missed 9 problems ... Left 1 blank .. 
Great day to fucking choose to pus out on my sleep body ! The day just before your AP Exam that you were going to make a 5 on ! 
Hmm , reading up on one of Marshall\ 
J . Gauvin's lectures ... I find it funny that 90 years later and his arguments are still valid . 
Pretty sure I just got a 5 on that AP Exam . 
Screw the AP test ! I GOT A NEW BATTERY FOR MY CAR ! 
Last night was enjoyable , I got to meet a few new people who I enjoyed the company of very much . Nyess , < PROPFEMALE > and DJ of course . 
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK ...... Why did it have to happen today of all days ? Fucking really ? FUCKING REALLY ?! I have no idea what to do right now thanks to this shit . Great .... 
What kind of gay shit is that ?! < PROPFIRST > Portnoy is guest drumming for Avenged Sevenfold's tour ?! They don't deserve his fucking pinky ! 
WHY'S FACEBOOK SO SILENT ?! 
I'm happy today for some reason ... 
DUDE ! 1984 is a supprisingly good book , like up there with Catch-22 . Probably going to take the place of Number 3 book of 20th century on my list ... 
That's kind of funny , < PROPFIRST > liked the female xbox and I was like \Hell yeah ! \ " so I added it . 3 hours later I've got like 6 friends that have added it . " 
I GOT TO HUG WISNER ! 
Why these Moslems so angry about us doing our free speech ? 
First post of the summer . 
Wow , < PROPMALE > Nationalistic songs are so catchy ! 
Probably going to go outside for no real reason and do stuff .... 
Gooing to the moovies .... 
I hate Hinesville , my speech has gotten so much more ghetto since I've lived here . 
Hold Devil's Pot of Tea will become almost as important as HIGH SPEED ALIEN DRUM < PROPFEMALE > ! 
ASFSDFUSDHFSYDH Stringless Violin is stick in my head ....

Let's build a snowman ! We can make him \ 
our best friend . We can name him < PROPMALE > or we can name him George ! We\ 
can make him tall , or we can make him not so tall . \ 
Snowman ! \ 
He'll\ 
have a happy face , a happy smile , a happy point of view . If you \

SAT is today , 7:45 in < PROPFEMALE > ! DON'T I HAVE AWESOME LUCK ?! At least I can go to Cat's party , yeeey . 
YEAH ! TURKEY'S GOING TO WIN THE WORLD CUP ! I KNOW IT ! 
I just realized this , KE$HA looks really trashy in her videos . 
I have come to the revalation that I am officially a socialst . Before I start getting yelled at for being a disgusting red bastard , Socialism =/ = Communism . \ 
Socialism can by all means be implemented under Democracy , but Communism ( as in the words of < PROPFEMALE > ) must be a dictatorship of the proletariat(The working class ) . Socialism also awards on the base of merit for your work , only Communism doesn't do that . 
Battlelore has turned out to be everything I wanted them to be ... Hehe .... 
SUCK IT ITALY ! YOU GOT YOUR ASS WHOOPED OUT OF THAT WORLD CUP ! \ 
Sorry for the Kiwis , at least you made number 3 in your group . 
OMG ! SCANNERS WAS AN WESOME MOVIE ! The ending was WORTH THE ENTIRE FILM !

STUPID SPAIN ! 
I officially moved to < PROPFEMALE > . 
I SCORED A 5 ON MY AP EURO EXAM ! ~ 
I would like to express my hatred for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . As < PROPFIRST > said , Hate is only a word reserved for those who deserve it . Well , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! You deserve this rare honor of mine . 
Listening to Fantasy . 
Yeah , I'm pretty sick . Not sure what I have but it sucks pretty bad . 
Vampires Suck was a decent movie , it brings out a lot of the reasons why Twilight is just crazy stupid . \ 
It'll be nice to watch it again in a non WP version with the extra scenes cut out and the music put it ... 
I will be officially staying in HIV . I can't make the move . 
The kittens have fallen asleep at the side of my bed , too bad they're too small to jump up with me . 
BAND TRIP ! 
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM IS OFFICIALLY OVER !!!!!! 
You should all listen to Speedy Claxton . GO THERE NOW ! 
Anyone want a kitten ? We have a total of 6 and we're getting rid of all but ... Two I think . 
GAWD , that horn KILLS my lips when I play trumpet music . It is really not meant to be played high ... 
God ... Republicans are so stupid . 
Silly fox news and your decision to report the controversy rather than the facts . 
PROFIT ! My Bank has paid me a total of 4 cents in my savings account ! 
I just had my mind blown . I looked up the word Agnostic Agnostic has not a damn thing to do with religion , it's STRICTLY about knowledge . \ 
\A person who denies or doubts the possibility of ultimate knowledge in some area of study . \"" 
GOOD MORNING FACBOOK ! WHO'S READY FOR COMPETITION ?!!?!?!

\Why should I spend half of my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell ? \ " - < PROPMALE > Simpson " 
Fried chicken breast is pretty gross . 
Mr. Wisner gave me the ultimately compliment today heading home from the quiz bowl competition . He said , \I probably wouldn't have gotten that question before you . \ " It was a question about < PROPMALE > Mussolini . There were a few obscure hints that nobody would have known but the moment I heard \ " King Zog\ " I knew it was < PROPMALE >." 
Sad face .................. 
Still sick 
Just got a new computer ... 
I'd like to re-affirm that I despise < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Congrats to you , you're the only human on the face of the earth that has not only earned my \hate\ " but has also kept it . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Empire is so awesome . 
ASDASDas < PROPFEMALE > Empire !!!! 
12 Highlanders and a Bagpipe make a rebellion . 
My dad bought me sushi .. good thing I didn't go to sushi house like I planned .. 
I really enjoy the perks of being a guy sometimes ... I can walk around with no shirt on . This works very well on hot days . 
Debate/Speech team seems really fun so far . 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim VS the World was amazing . That was just awesome .... It makes fun of everything I hate and has jokes about what I love :D . Damn hipsters .

Party : Slowbrow(59 ) , Fearow(50 ) , Granbull(50 ) , Hitmonchan(50 ) , Dragonite(55 ) , Typhlosion(50 ) . 
.... Why do people think Democrats are Liberals and Socialistic ? I feel offended that people would group those pussy-footed moderates in with my group ! \ 
Curiosity , do you think Democrats are Liberal and Socialist ? If so , then why ? And if not , I would also like to know why . 
Wolfram Texted me and said that there's danger of freezing rain . No school ! 
The zombie movie \Fido\ " was awesome xD . < PROPFIRST > Connolly makes such a great zombie . " 
Noo ! Everyone stop iiiit !!!

JAZZ BAND ! 
You're The First , You're The Last by < PROPMALE > White has an awesome bass line . 
Interesting fact , The Socialist Party USA officially is against the Healthcare Reform < PROPMALE > of 2010 because It's \a corporate restructuring of the health insurance industry created to protect the profit margins of private insurance companies . \ " \ 
Off to SATs 
< PROPFEMALE > Palin is gonna get PRESIDENT IN 2012 ! YEAH ! REFUDIATE THAT ! 
Railroad Tycoon 3 is better than 2 gameplay wise but the maps are TERRIBLE ! 
Depending on whether Wolfram is going to school is whether I am today ...

Still feeling sick unfortunately , I do hope these shenanigans get over soon . 
Sakura Wars is a great game , but the mechs are so gay !

QUIZ BOWL !! ROAAARRGGHHH !!!!!! WAYCROSS TOMORROW !!! 
QUIZ BOWL TODAY ! RRUUUGGGHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!! 
I hate it when someone tells someone something and expects them to keep it as a secret . Human's can't keep secrets , it's not possible . If you tell someone something you better not get all pissy when they tell someone else . 
Listening to Rush for the first time in months ... T_T .. I know again why they are my favorite band . 
Ayumi Hamasaki ... Ah ... Nostalgia .. 
Interesting fact ... The hottest temperature ever achieved was ... 2 billion degrees K( 3.6 billion F ) . Fusion takes place at the center of the sun at ... Only 15 million degrees K ...... So it's only 133 times hotter than the CENTER OF THE SUN ! 
Heeey , my SAT scores came back . I made exactly 100 points more . Totaling 1700 ...... I feel like a failure ... 610 , 610 , 480 . 
Damn you Salgado .... 
Dude , there's a hobby shop in Hinesville ! So going to go there for D&D and Magic ! 
I feel ... Weird ... I've not studied for anything since Wisner .... DAMN YOU SALGADO ! 
Is it bad if I have better conversations with Chinese people on Omegle than native English Speakers ? 
Why do many metalcore riffs sound like crappy Gothenburg Metal riffs ? If you're going to copy At The Gates or In Flames , at least do it well . 
It seems that your chances of surviving a serious plane crash are higher than surviving a serious car crash .... That's really sad ... 
Tonight .... Is going to be a rough night .... 
I'm going out ... I'll find something to do . 
o_o ..... Aparently ... Gas prices aren't anywhere near as high as we think . We're paying effectively less money for gas prices than we did back in the late 70s and early 80s .... The reason gas prices SEEM so high is because inflation has increased so rapidly that it affects us more . Wages can't keep up with inflation giving us the illusion of higher gas prices ... 
The new Oprhaned Land album is awesome . 
Life is going to get REALLY interesting this next month ... 
Your mama's so ugly , Fluorine wouldn't bond with her . 
Well that sucks , couldn't sleep last night . 
Let's start a new Nuzlocke challenge on Fire Red !!! Let's start with ... BULBASAUR !!!! 
Night , Festival tomorrow ..... 
Got all 1s at Festival , probably the 30th person to say it . 
First casualty , a level 10 rattata .... Poor guy .. Died to a critical hit from a level 9 pidgey ... Makes me feel bad because he curb stomped the previous level 9 pidgey . 
Casualty #2 - Zubat level 20 vs 18 Charmander RIP ... I was really looking forward to my crobat . 
My mother bought Madyson a piece of shit 1$ recorder . I played it before her , it's so terrible xD ! 
Awesome , my mother got me a rice cooker . 
.... I planned for the day , but not for the night ... Awkward ... So who's doing something tonight ? 
I think today was actually a nice and enjoyable day . Played and RPG and hanged out with a person . 
Made myself a damn Blackberry milkshake . Hells yeah !!!!! 
I just thought of something .. I'M GOING TO BUY STOCKS AND SELL IT BEfore DECEMBER 2012 ! Then after 2012 and the stock prices fall I'm going to buy the SHIT out of everything . 
Is it bad if I support Eugenics but would never trust anyone to < PROPFEMALE > it out correctly , including myself ? 
MEGACON ! Leaving for it today and going to it tomorrow . 
I'm in < PROPMALE > ! FUN ! 
Yay ! Going to Megacon ! 
I've become addicted to WC3 and DIablo 2 again ... 
lol , When < PROPFIRST > Tillis and I wrestle it comes down to how long I last on the ground until I tire out . Could be 5 minutes or 5 seconds . 
Beach ......

DSi came in today .
