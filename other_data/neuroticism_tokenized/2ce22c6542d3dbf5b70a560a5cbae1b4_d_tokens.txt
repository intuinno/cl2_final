All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , have more money , a new phone ..... A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is FIGHTING cancer OR already kicked it's ass , post this . In honor of a friend's friend who starts chemo tomorrow .

I want to thank 91 countries , including the US , South Korea , Germany and Switzerland , for offering their aid and assistance to the tsunami devastated areas in Japan . I am heartbroken and feeling helpless , but I'm really grateful for everyone's prayers and thoughts to the people in my country . Thank you .
