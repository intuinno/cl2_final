Oh , how crazy Longhorn fans are ! 
I'm a pusher . I push people . 
-So , I have taken fat kid to a new level . I ate goldfish as I was falling asleep and fell asleep with the box under my arm . When I woke up , I finished the box off before going to class . 
http://www.formspring.me/jngarza

Happy B-Day to my BB !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
...... KA-ME-HA-ME-HAAAAAAAA !!!!! 
Can't believe that I am about to watch my little sister graduate ;_; 
is not ready to start class again in the morning . 
Just got my Uproar Festival ticket !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Any guy who thinks he is going to come between me and my schoolwork is sadly mistaken . 
About to leave for Warped Tour ! 
-Go watch A7X's new music video for Nightmare . The end made me cry . 
I don't suck at life . Life sucks at me . 
Fake faces everywhere I see . Fake people looking back at me . 
-When the power of love overcomes the love of power , the world will know peace . 
-You can't see California without < PROPMALE > Brando's eyes . 
-I've been packing all day ..... Someone please freeze time for a bit . I'm not ready to start class just yet . 
-Hasta la vista , Bonham ! 
30 minutes into my first day of class , and I am already struggling to stay awake . 
To fit inside your mold would be to sell myself short . 
Pretty sure I'm getting tattooed today . 
Seven days until Sevenfold comes :) 
-Nothing hurts my world , just affects the ones around me :) 
Probably the best day of my life . I got a pick from < PROPMALE > Root and Syn Gates , and I had the privilege of meeting < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Life is grand right now . 
About to go watch Bullet For My < PROPFIRST > in the rain . This should be fun . 
is the one they call Dr. Feelgood . :) 
My name is < PROPFEMALE > , and I am addicted to concerts . 
Waiting in line at the Flyleaf and Story of the Year show . Wish you were with me .... 
... So I'm in the same area as the gunmen . This can't be happening . Someone tell me this is a nightmare . 
-I miss you , < PROPFIRST > Collins Moss 
is hoping these kidney stones will pass soon .... X_o 
-Care about what other people think , and you will always be their prisoner . 
Just puked all over the floor next to my gurney . How embarrassing . 
Just got interviewed for a tv show , but it apparently won't air until December or January :( 
Wear your heart on your sleeve . Make things hard to believe & hearts ; 
I am round , and round is a shape . Therefore , I am in shape . 
It annoys me how middle- aged Mexican men gawk at every girl who passes them . 
is going to be Bellatrix Lestrange for Halloween . I just decided . Bwahahaha . 
-Words are meaningless and forgettable . All I ever wanted , all I ever needed is here in my arms . Words are very unnecessary . They can only do harm . 
All That Remains , Asking < PROPFEMALE > , and Born of Osiris tomorrow ! Woot woot ! 
Just literally almost knocked over the drummer of Asking < PROPFEMALE > on 6th street . Ahahaha 
Go take your opinion with you , ' cause I don't want to hear it . Go take your decisions with you , ' cause I don't need to hear them . 
Double majoring + a concentration in Spanish + work = the semester from hell 
Go ahead , and bury it deep down inside . Cage that longing in your heart . Hold that thought , just for a moment . Let your heart feel numb . 
One week until HP7 !!!!!!!! 
Two roads split off from here , and my life goes running in opposite directions , exaggerating the barrier between who I am and who I want to be . 
can't wait for < PROPMALE > Potter at the IMAX tomorrow :) 
< PROPFEMALE > loves the beat and the lust it commands . Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands , < PROPMALE > . 
has a 30 < PROPFEMALE > journal , a 10 < PROPFEMALE > paper , a 5 < PROPFEMALE > paper , and a 2 < PROPFEMALE > paper due next week . Plus , a paper presentation and 2 final exams on the same day . Someone please shoot me now . I'm already exhausted just thinking about it . 
will be a senior in 2 weeks !!!! 
All of these cartoon pictures are making me have flashbacks from my childhood years , back when I had time to watch these shows and life was simple .... 
is fighting evil by moonlight :) 
hid the keys to unlock love's heart :) 
Whooo ! I'm a senior now ! Let's celebrate ! 
Pigs is Pigs & hearts ; 
I wish that TBS and Blink-182 would do a co-headlining tour in the summer . 
Yay ! \

Dear < PROPMALE > Chamberlain , marry me . 
I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man . She must be quiet . - 1 < PROPFIRST > 2:12 ... hah 
A year ago today , we lost one of the most innovative drummers of our time . R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Sullivan . Your fans will always miss you . 
You write such pretty words , but life's no storybook . Love's an excuse to get hurt and to hurt . 
Thank goodness I don't live in this drama infested hell hole anymore . 
People in Bonham should find something to do , rather than attack each other on social networking sites and create unnecessary drama . Go listen to some music and relax ! 
will be seeing Skrillex on February 5th :) 
Blink-182 is currently recording guitars for their new album , and Taking Back Sunday's new album is apparently dropping in March . I hope these bands put out something worth listening to because the music scene is suffering right now . 
This is the first day of my prolonged senior year .... Wish me luck . 
Was just on stage with < PROPMALE > Leto !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I tried to be someone else , but nothing seemed to change . I know now , this is who I really am inside . 
I just cooked breakfast for the first time in my life . I'm a disgrace to women everywhere . 
I hate when my friends date people who completely control them to the point that they ignore everyone else . If you can't trust someone , then you shouldn't be with them . 
I miss playing the drums . 
Boooo . Being 21 sucks so far . I can't stay asleep , and I have an exam at 9 . 
Thanks to my family , friends , classmates , and roomates for making my 21st a great day , even though school prevented me from celebrating for now . 
3 concerts in 4 days . I wonder if I will survive .... 
I'm so excited that Motley Crue is coming to < PROPFIRST > . 
Motorhead show tomorrow , and then I get to work at the Texas Film Hall of Fame Ceremony on Thursday , where < PROPFIRST > Rodriguez and < PROPFIRST > Judge will be making appearances . This is going to be a great week ! 
Motorhead = loudest show I've ever been to . I can't hear anything right now . 
Just carried the Texas Film Hall of Fame Awards backstage . This is so exciting ! 
I want to change the world , but I don't know where to begin . 
About to go buy records from < PROPFIRST > White and then go party with < PROPFIRST > WK . Life is great :) 
Seeing < PROPMALE > Moore and < PROPFIRST > Saller in the same night . 14-year-old me would be jealous of 21-year-old me . 
About to watch Bright Eyes and relax ! 
We must blend into the choir , sing as static with the whole . \ 
We must memorize nine < PROPFIRST > and deny we have a soul . \ 
And in this endless race for property and privilege to be won , we must run . We must run . We must run & hearts ; 
The Devil Wears Prada , Attack Attack ! and A Day to Remember are headling Warped Tour 2011 . 
Just got in trouble for drumming on tables during Spanish . -_- 
Truth is .... I no longer give a fuck about what anyone thinks of me :) 
... Concert withdrawals . 
So , I get to do a presentation about Heavy Metal in one of my classes . I looooooooove college . 
What a sad , sad picture to paint of a dirty , dirty little soul . We are so blind here . Let's watch this all fall apart .
