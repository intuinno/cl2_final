Remember all babies born sleeping or whom we've carried but never met , or those we've held but couldn't take home , or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority wont do it because unlike cancer baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all angels too perfect for earth . [[ 3/11/11 mommy loves you angel <3 ]]
