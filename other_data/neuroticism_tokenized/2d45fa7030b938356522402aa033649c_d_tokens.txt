Just got home from the big trip , it was great ! But now I gotta get things ready for school since I did NO work >__<; duuuur .

Lazy Sundays ..... aren't they the greatest ? XD

Random Fact ! Did you know that watching Food Network while hungry is like watching porn ? 
is getting tired of people wanting the same darn thing from everybody . = 3 = 
A smile is a curve that can get a lot of things straight . :D 
\A cautious person leaves no stones unturned . \ " .... * turns over all the stones * what was supposed to be under them ? D: > Darn you fortune cookies and being vauge !! " 
Happy Fourth of July everybody ! Hope you have fun being ....... awesomely American ? xD ; 
Oh mah gosh they just announced some of the english voices for Hetalia Axis powers ! I can't wait to see it come out xD 
I feel so proud of myself right now . I , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , has cooked a cheeseburger on her own without getting splattered to death ( by grease ) or having the entire downstairs looking like a pot house . And I didn't have to cut it in over 9000 times to see if it were raw . i feel so American . * happy tear * 
Tried waking up this morning .... the plan failed . ._. ; so now I'm noming on some leftover chicken and then get ready to < PROPFEMALE > out . OM NOM NOM NOM NOM ! 
just cleaned < PROPFEMALE>'s cat , Ginger ... she's BABY < PROPFEMALE > JEZUS !!! ~ ( = 0 =) ~

Has been playing the PS2 today , and wow don't I feel like a Narutard . Naruto Ultimate Ninja 3 is such an easy game , just time consuming . > n < ; 
I've always considered myself the not-so-sharp tool in the shed . I just made Hot Cocoa in the middle of the summer instead of having a creamcicle . how do you put up that logic ? XD 
Honestly getting tired of immature people on deviantART . They created artist comments for a reason , and that is so they can explain something you don't understand about the picture . Read it . Enlighten me with what you learned from reading it . 
Just watched ' The Orphan ' on DVD , and DANG I screamed at the TV so much ! But it kept me at the edge of my seat and the black light added a nice touch ~ 
< PROPFEMALE > is some escape artist . I mean ... sheesh xD 
Wow , who knew a TV show would make me ask this question ... What would be your ' Super Date ' if you could have it ? ( Asking girls mainly but guys are free to answer ) 
Looking through old RP's I did on a chat I go to and now I see how much I FAILED at spelling ! And the posts were from LAST summer ! D: Highschool changes one person , huh ? XD 
Happy and sad at the same time 3 : Happy : The song I'm listening to is epically adorable and mom and I had a nice conversation during dinner . Sad : Gotta go to bed soon because I start the driving part of Drivers < PROPMALE > tomorrow , Monday and Tuesday ... I hope I don't have any fatalities on my hands xD 
Welp , off to go drive ... I'm gonna be the next Miss Yukari from Azumanga Daioh ! * drives off like a madwoman * > XD 
You bring the ropes and chains , I'll bring the pills and games . I can show you pain , and make you say my name ~ ( Bruises and Bitemarks ) god it's so addicting D: 
Wish I was a more watched artist on dA , but alas ... people don't watch Higurashi or give a darn about your Higu , Soul Eater or furry OC's >_< 
Just saw ' The Lightning Thief ' on DVD while on the laptop . It was pretty good and action packed . But compared to Twilight with putting as much as book information in it , Twilight has more true book information . This movie killed the book , left out so many vital characters and made so many character CHANGES ... I could rant forever , but overall a good movie . 
\OMG I LOVE THE THUNDERSTORMS THEY'RE SO COOL !! \ " NO . I DISAGREE ! THUNDERSTORMS ARE LOUD AND MEAN AND SCARY AND SHAKE THE HOUSE AND TAKE AWAY YOUR POWER . < PROPFEMALE > LIKES HER POWER . SHE LIKES BEING ON THE COMPUTER DOING COMPUTER STUFF . > M < " 
I'm an intelligent person . I just found out how to change my BG on my laptop ... and since I'm obsessed with a song by the Vocaloids , I made it the chibi's from a video xD 
I swear to the higher name that ' < PROPFEMALE > Human Sacrifice ' is so ADDICTING ! Darn you interweb people and getting me addicted !! * shakes fist * DAAARRRNNN YOUUUUUU !!! Besides that I passed the driving part of the driving test thingy ... I need to do the written test naow . c : 
Well aren't I a sm < PROPMALE > little thing ? I just remembered the final p < PROPMALE > of Soul Eater dub has come out on the internet ! XD I'mma watch it now ... then read the manga , because apparently it's 100% better ( not in < PROPMALE > style though D:< ) 
The day people of the United States have an actual drinking age law for drinking soda , I will just laugh . I dunno , thought that occured to me . Since things that are illegal now were perfectly acceptable not-so-long ago XD 
Had a great day today . We had a surprise party for daddy , he had a great time > w < The only thing that stinks is that my body is always telling me to GO TO THE BATHROOM D: I drank too much soda ;____; 
Getting tired of being asked to do something I don't wanna do . : I 
I honestly hate my stomach . I went to bed just fine and I wake up and hurl it all out . : I now I don't feel hungry , yet I still managed to eat . WTF is wrong with me !? D:

< PROPFEMALE>'s Funniest Videos ( AFV ) is not an amusing show overall anymore . The jokes are overused and some of the videos are predictable . The only things I find amusing anymore either have babies or animals in them . : I 
oh mighty power of apple cider and Snicker < PROPFEMALE > bars , make my rainy mood go away ... ~ XD

Waking up isn't my favorite thing this week , apparently .. .__. 
New semester , atleast I'm done with Surles and Long ... yeah , that's good .. I'm done with a lot of people . 
Another average day at WFRHS , yep ... 
Don't ya hate it when you're tired and wanna wake up with a shower , and it's like .. SO AWESOME and you're doing your shower buisness then suddenly the water goes COLD ?! Then you have to finish up what you're doing and get the HECK out of there , cuz you're waking up to a nice hot shower that went cold . B < 
French toast and bacon , the BREAKFAST OF AWESOME ! D < 
Whoooo , it's monday , and I gotta take a CIVICS TEST ... yay ... * sarcasm * 
Ignorance , judgment , doubt . We're all guilty of these , but that doesn't mean you have to blanantly express it to my FACE . 
Okay . So I'm getting dressed and notice my kitten calender ( I ENJOY KITTENS . SO HUSH . ) is still in ' Janurary ' , so I change it to Feburary and like ... I honestly think that kitten wants to kill me . : I It's gonna haunt me in my sleep . Besides that , I did the awesome Wedsnday Tradition . 
Insane ? I prefer \Too Awesome When Provoked\ " . ;3 " 
It's rainy and I don't feel well . Same for yesterday . What do I do ? SLEEP . : I 
Goin ' to the mall to get a new haircut and maybe get some cool stuff . Like a webcam ~ :3 
Got a haircut ( which I hate . ) , a new webcam , Asking < PROPFEMALE > ' Stand Up And Scream ' CD and a < PROPFIRST > Skellington wallet . c : 
Just sitting around watching funny clips from Naruto Shippuden . It's funny scenes like those that made me love the ORIGINAL SERIES . If only it didn't go on forever , then maybe I'd have the attention span to watch it . BC 
I HAS SAMMICH ! 
Trolololol , went to ' meet the teacher ' night with mom and we bailed out on going to the 1st period class . Nobody wants to meet Ms. Price . All my other teachers are awesome besides her . 
Ugh , whatever is making me wake up constantly for no reason and banging my head against the wall .. I want it to stop , I miss long sleep-filled nights . ;__; 
I'M FULL OF COMPLAINTS TODAY , HUH ? I just have had body aches all day and coughing like a sick person , yaaaaay . ._. 
Snow is falling and you'd expect school to give a spazzy 2hr delay as usual , epsecially now that I WANT one because I feel miserable . Nope , still gotta go to school on time , ugh . 
I HATE OREOS NOW . For the time being . I'm watching dad and his friend < PROPMALE > play a Tiger Woods game for the PS3 and I'm TRYING TO EAT the last of the oreos with some milk . Most of the little cookies fell into the dairy , then for NO REASON WHATSOEVER , the milk SPILLS ALL OVER MY SWEATS AND SOCKS . FML . Oreos hate Reese's . 
PEPSI IS HAZZARDOUS TO MY HEALTH . : I \ 
This is why Coke is better for me ~ :D 
I love showers . You can laugh , cry , rage , sing or anything and it won't judge you . I get the BEST ideas for stories/pictures/characters from the shower . I love you shower , you're amazing . c : <3 
Playing Tekken 6 on the PS3 , freaking yelling at the TV . xD\ 
And read chapter 83 to Soul Eater manga , IT'S BECOMING AS AWESOME AS IT USED TO BE 8DDDDD 
I never thought in my life Coke could taste so good ... ; w ; <3 
Guh , who would've thought a little spin-literally-would've made me feel so bad ? D: \ 
Thanks a lot < PROPFIRST > , hope you're feeling as blaghy as me . xD 
Home sick , again . Gonna try to be ' well ' enough to do make up work and such tomorrow ! 
I just finished watching Pokemon Black and White on youtube .. I love the water type , Oshawott . Now I have another pokemon to add to my list of favies . Finally , a blue one . I love the orange ones for some reason . xD 
I don't know the cause of this , but I've been like a hungryhungry hippo tonight . I ate two servings of steak , a muffin , and now a whole bowl of popcorn .... ;___; 
Finally it's Friday ... ~ ; w ; 
I don't know if it's because of my regaining health , but I've been taking naps a lot recently around the 4pm time and waking up around 6 . I just happen to be awake now cuz mom woke me up from calling the house , I love you , mom . <3 
Just break it apart , her heart ~ <3 
I THINK I SHOULD JUST UNPLUG MY HEATER . Because everytime I turn it on before bed , I wake up feeling like I'mma be a'roastin ' in mah rewm .

So I apparently was called ' flat chested ' today ... a lot of people I know probably disagree , < PROPFEMALE > thanks . : B 
No matter how hot my room is , I will never , EVER , EVERRRR , sleep with a de-humidifyer in my room again . It just makes me wake up constantly , trying to cover my ears with a pillow/blanket throughout the night and waking up . And then I LOSE sleeping time . Now I have a headache and it sucks big ones . 
Ugh , does nature not want me to sleep ? D: We had a huge hail/thunder storm last night and I tossed n ' turned for a good hour , gaaah . Thank goodness it's Thursday . x_x

Midterm week . English tomorrow , Latin on Wednesday , and Band Thursday . Then NO SCHOOL FRIDAY . so awesome . We played sharades/pictionary and sculpting in Latin , so cool to study . > w > 
So today in civics we talked about the Democratic/Republican parties . Some of us picked random president papers . I got McCain .. xD\ 
ENGLISH MIDTERM WAS EASY . LUNCH WAS ROFL . Band was blah . B < \ 
Latin was awesome besides the fire drill . \ 
And yeah . Life . <3
