heart that'll never go away ... I love you DAD ! ? Miss you greatly .

My Head feels a little heavy today .... but it was well worth it sitting outside the Padio at Chesters last night with my < PROPMALE > Friends singing , exchanging fun Memories and lots of laughs ... it got a little loud and they asked us to leave , haven't had that much Fun in a while . 
I am really sad that Friday was my last day at work . I had the most Amazing Co-Workers ( Friends ) anyone could ever wish for . Thank you for the crazy fun times we had together at work ( and off work ) and for the awesome Going Away Party at Whistle Binkies ( love the Photo Album you Guys put together ) also all the wonderful Friends I made over the years working at Mayo .. I will miss you all terribly , we will stay in touch . 
Movers are here now ... kinda nice I don't have to pack anything myself or move the Furniture , makes the transition a lot easier , lol 
St Cloud is really nice so far but I miss Rochester already .... Interview on Tuesday at the St Cloud Federal Credit Union :) 
Interview went very well , we even shared some laughs together , there where quite a bit Applicant's for only one Job opening though , so I guess just have to wait and see :) 
Off to the Renaissance Festival tomorrow to meet up with some Friends .... its gonna be fun !!! 
I am very excited , had an Interview today and he offered me the Job right away at the St Cloud City and County Employee Credit Union :) 
For Life Changing Events I always call my Sister and Brother first and thank God everyday for the awesome Family he gave me , I have the best Family anyone can wish for ... thank you Guy's for always being there , love you !!! 
Love my new job , new house and made some new friends ..... Life is great !!! 
On a vegetarian and gluten free diet for a while to see if my situation is allergy related ..... don't like the gluten free stuff though , it tastes awful 
Rainy Saturday , guess I catch up with calling my Family and some Friends ..... having Grandma over tomorrow for Roast and Knoedel ( Dumplings ) and maybe some wine ? 
Planning to have Thanksgiving at our House this year but I never prepard a turkey before so my awesome brother in law ( < PROPFIRST > ) is taking care of the turkey :) 
Want's to go home so bad , my favorite Brother In-Law ( Firefighter in Augsburg , Germany ) is having his 40th Birthday in December , they are renting a big hall and having a big Party with lots of Family and Friends and the Fire departments own Band playing ... it's gonna be a blast !!! 
Hunting Season , i can hear them shooting from my backyard .... don't like the sound of killing . 
Does anybody has dual citizenship and now how to apply for the american one without losing my < PROPMALE > citizenship ? 
Had a great Thanksgiving with Family and Friends , it was the first time we hosted Thanksgiving , everything turned out well , had a full house and lots of fun :)) 
Why do most women think they need a man to fulfill their life to be happy ? They rather spend months or even years dating that person , knowing they are with the wrong Guy out of fear of being alone ... can somebody explain that to me ?... it's so annoying !!! 
Auf geht's zum Kickboxing got to get back in shape after the Holiday's :) 
Does anybody know what to give a dog in pain for ear infection , we didn't get an appointment to see the vet until tomorrow . 
My Husband applied to a Job Position that was posted last week for a Safety Officer at the Airport in Stuttgart/Germany ... waiting to hear back from them , the Kids are super exited .... they would love to live in Germany for a couple years and be closer to their Family there . 
< PROPMALE > week at Aldis starts today , going to hurry there after work to get my 20 bags of Erdnussflips ( peanut flips ) , bread , black < PROPMALE > ham and all the other goodies from < PROPMALE > y bevore they are gone again !!!

Meine Tochter faehrt heute zum erstenmal alleine mit dem Auto in die Arbeit seit Sie Ihren Fuehrerschein hat .... bin jetzt schon total nervoes . 
Had a really great time yesterday going out to eat with family to < PROPFIRST>'s Restaurant , the owner there was actually from Austria and such a character , while the family played cards at our house afterwards , < PROPFEMALE > and I hit the bar in downtown St Cloud . Thanks < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > for the fun time :) 
Walked my dog < PROPFIRST > for 30 minutes this morning , than cardio/weight training for an hour ... i am so ready for spring !!! 
Just came back from a walk/run with < PROPFIRST > and it really upsets me that people over by the apartment complex throw their garbage ( soda cans , mc donalds bags , even beer bottles etc . ) everywhere on the sidewalk by the protected wetland , they really dont give a crap about their environment . 
Eine Schwester oder ein Bruder ist im Herzen das ganze Leben < PROPFEMALE > . Es ist die Woche der Geschwister , also wenn Du Geschwister hast und glücklich darüber bist , sie liebst und nie vermissen möchtest , < PROPFEMALE > mache eine Kopie und setz es in Deinen Status 
Having some < PROPMALE > breakfeast this morning , Vollkornbrot ( Sunflower Seed Bread ) with cheese some fresh strawberry's and grapes vs cream filled Doughnats :) 
Did you Guy's in Rochester get a lot of snow yet ?
