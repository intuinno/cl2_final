My scripts are more like novels . -.- 

I can't wait to get my hair back to it's best color ... RED ! <3 
Writing and editing , editing and writing . 
Hey , I enjoyed ' Night of the Iguana!' Is that so wrong ?! 
Must ... order ... Jane < PROPFEMALE > Workout DVDs ... Don't ... have ... VCR ... in ... my ... room ! 
\I don't like standard beauty - there is no beauty without strangeness . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Lagerfeld " 
I should probably stop sleeping all day and staying up all night routine ... It's like the boring , mortal version of a vampire . 
HAHAHA , no really , you look great ... 
With el sombrero on our heads ... 
\What is that ? It looks like a cross between a pig and a bear ! \ " \ " A PEAR ?! \"" 
Retro week is over ! Starting now , post a picture of someone fictional that you think best represents your personality . Be creative . It will be interesting to see what/whom you choose ... Copy and paste this so we can all play along . 
A lil black < PROPFEMALE > by the name of ' Sookie ' has joined our family today . :) It's exausting being a mama ( again ) . 
\It's the 80's! Do a lot of coke and vote for < PROPFIRST > Reagan ! \"" 
Do others know how their behavior and attitude effects those around them ? 
Please send your best wishes to my Dad's recovery ( he's in the hospital because his appendix burst ) . Also , RIP Uncle < PROPFIRST > . I'm glad I had the < PROPMALE > to meet you . 
I'm already excited for Halloween this year ... Oh Darkwing Manor , I give you my blood , sweat , tears , and screams yet again . :D 
\Dogs never bite me . Just humans . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
Whoa ... I don't see a ringer on your finger ! 
Dad's back in the hospital . Yet again , the health care in the Rogue Valley has failed us . 
THERE IS NO WEAKNESS IN THIS DOJO ! 
Dad's back home , resting . Thank you all for your prayers and best wishes ! 
No peace and quiet today or tonight it seems . -_- 
Apparently ' Fatal Frame ' does not exist in Medford . Not the first one , the second one , the third one , or the fourth one ! COME ON BLOCKBUSTER ! That's FOUR games . You have ZERO . YOU SUCK . 
Hmm ... Been feeling weird lately ( and not my normal weird . ) 
I hate those Air Wick comercials . It doesn't smell THAT good . 
I just want to tell all of my dear friends who have got through incredible pain and loss these past few years or for a LONG time that you are truly the strongest people I know . Because of you , I know how blessed I really am . I love and admire you dearly . 
\Infants are such babies . \"" 
@ < PROPFIRST > just did my hair and it has not looked this cute in a LOOOONG time . Love it ! <333 
This is all making me nervous . 
\He's a cop . He's a Rabbi . They're cops . Except for the Rabbi . \"?" 
I'm so lucky to be part of such a great wolf & badger pack . (: 
I wish my foot would heal faster so I could jog or shop or SOMETHING . -.- And to think , I used to be a master in the Immobile Arts ... 
I don't think I've been so happy/content for this long in quite a few years . :) 
\That's how I survived . Time and time again . That's my secret . I survived because I willed it to be . ... How did I survive apocalyptic fire ? I simply refused to feel the flames . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Frost " 
Ugh , I feel miserable . :( 
My body hurts ALL over . :'( I don't like this . 
<---- Doctor Blondie ; Medicine Woman . 
Fatigued and getting over a bout of depression . I'll be alright . 
No more depression ! Just fatigue ! I can handle that . Mmm , night night . <3 
Alright , so Badgey and I need a name for a group of people who fall off their shoes and get injured ... yes , you read that right . 
Wow , my 21st birthday is coming up fast ! I'll have a Capri Sun with just a hint of a crazy straw , please ... 
People exhaust me ! 
Alright , well , looks like everything's calming down a bit ( including me ) thanks to my wonderful friends . * < PROPMALE > Frasier Clap * 
I got my first paycheck today and I've lost 5 pounds this week . :) Talk about a good day !!! 
Aw , I think I broke my stomach ! :( I've never been so afraid to eat ice cream ... NOM NOM NOM ! 
4 more days until I'm officially 21 . Whew ! 
Busy weekend ! Got to bleach a shower with Badgy , open a checking account , hit a sale at Kohls , and then go up to Wilsonville over night for my Aunt's wedding the next day , and then on Sunday , it's the big 2-1 . Oy vay ... 
I am officially 21 years old . 
Awwww ! Thank you everyone for the ' Happy Birthday ' comments ! <3 
Had a lovely birthday . Thank you , everyone ! Going to start reading < PROPFEMALE > Silverman's book , ' The Bedwetter ' . XD 
< PROPMALE > Elvgren's work makes me happy . :) 
I'm sleepy ... I just want to curl up in a little ball and sleep like the kitties do ... * Yawn & Stretch * Meooooooooow . 
Feeling fatigued . Need a good cat nap ! 
is fine . I mean , I'm not running around , wind in my hair , the hills are alive with the sound of music fine , but ... 
I'm so sleepy that I can't sleep ! 
To be content is to snuggle with your animals for a nice little nap . :) 
I love coming back from Barnes & < PROPMALE > with a fresh batch of books ! Seriously , books are like cookies to me . <3 I'm such an odd duck . 
Dad just got me a gorgeous 1930's dress I was drooling over on EBay ( I didn't know he bought it , I just got it in the mail today ) . Seriously made my week . :) 
It's too hot ! I need to buy a fan for my room ... ugh . 
Just a heads up to anyone who calls me ... my cell phone is stooooopid and I don't get a lot of texts or voicemails until later . Gonna get a better phone soon ( mines old ) . I swear I'm not ignoring anyone ! 
Jace and I are getting ready to play Veteran on RE5 . Wheeeeee ! 
I'm coming down with a rather nasty head cold . The only good news seems to be that I'll probably lose my voice soon ! 
Still feeling icky . If anyone needs to talk to me , I'd advise a text . My voice is gone and I can't exactly talk on the phone . Just a warning . 
Doctor Blondie , Medicine Woman's advice ; DO NOT eat nachos when you're sick . Now excuse me whilst I travel back in time to slap my hand away from the nachos of the past . 
I can't believe I've been sick all week ! That's ridiculous . :( I guess it's kinda a good thing my boss and fellow accident prone sister was also sick . * Cough-cough-hack-up-lung * GET BETTER SOON MsE ! :D 
Usually I like to watch happy and funny things , but when I'm sick , I MUST watch the ' Tudors ' . Makes no sense . 
I think I'm just getting more and more ill . >_< 
Alright , Fright Fest NW . Who else is going ? 
\Happiness is not a circus clown rolling around in a big tractor tire so that his arms and legs form ' spokes . ' Happiness is when he stops . \"" 
Why does my brain insist on freezing up as soon as I decide to get back to writing ?! BRAIN ! I've got scripts to write ! Don't make me come up there ... 
\Today is a day for VAPOR TRAILS ! \"" 
Blah . Thank Dog this day is almost over . 
Busy day today ! There will be hair and makeup EVERYWHERE , like a beauty shop battlefield . 
Reading dirty sci-fi novels and listening to Grace Jones . Times like these that I really wonder who would ever marry a girl like moi . ^____^ 
I hate it when my car has problems . It freaks me out . -_- Maybe I should just walk everywhere ... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! 
Now listening to Massive Attack's ' Inertia Creeps ' and getting ready to settle down with a nice bed-time story ... ' Pride and Predjudice and Zombies ' . For me , this is joy . :) 
I hate when I have the day off or it's the weekend and I STILL wake up at 7 or 8am ... and I can't go back to sleep . I used to be such an expert at sleeping in ... 
Just got really ill all of a sudden . Ugh ... 
Been fighting off a panic-nervous breakdown for a few months now . It's taken it's toll on me mentally and physically , so I'm just trying to rest now . Might be MIA for a while , but don't worry about me . Just need a mental rest ! 
I have a cold ... BOOOGERS ! 
Hoping I'll be cured by Monday ... 
Been rewatching Red Vs Blue ( Blood Gulch Chronicles , Reconstruction , Relocated , Recreation ) . Best . Online . Series . Ever . 
Finally feeling better ! NOT doing anything for two weeks is annoying . 
Have I ever mentioned how annoying I find script-writing ?! Yes ? Well , let me just remind everyone again ; it's annoying . WORDS ! 
There are a bunch of young and attractive men in my backyard , painting our house . I'm home alone ... must . no t.t urn . on . sprinklers . RESIST . URGE . But I might go running outside covered in fake blood and then ask one of them what year it is ... 
I adore my friends . Just one night of D&D with them and I've forgotten about any depression or anything else stressful . <3 
Today has just proved a theory I've been trying to prove correct for years ! Being a nerd is a BLAST ! <3 
Renfaire 2010 was a blast ! Even though it was 100 degrees and I was in a corset , I'd do it again in a heartbeat . <3 
Reading ' Island of the Sequined Love Nun ' by < PROPFIRST > Moore and trying to get some sleep tonight . I wish I could take sleeping pills . Those commercials make them look soooo nice ... 
Got a ton of awesome movies to watch from a friend ( including some Bogey & Bacall ) . Mostly old , cheesy horror/sci-fi flicks . <3 I'm in heaven . 
\\o/ H E L P !!! \ 
I'm drowning in the clutter in my room !!!!!!! 
Sprint , I hate you . 
Getting over some depression . Watching Futurama with a few good friends ALWAYS helps . :) 
Side note ; How can someone NOT enjoy ' Fight Club' ? Seriously , Jace ? Is you fo reals ? 
Currently obsessed with Red Dead Redemption and Rule of < PROPFEMALE > . I see an ' R ' trend here ... O_o 
To all my dear friends ; I am feeling quite under the weather and depressed . I need to rest , then get my arse in gear . But for now , I'll be pretty much ignoring my cell phone until further notice . I've already cancelled any plans for the rest of this week . Please , let me rest ! It takes a bit longer for me to get back to functioning properly . Thank you . 
Rule of < PROPFEMALE > is so beautifully disturbing . <3 Why am I so attracted to grungy , peculiar , and risque things ? Don't answer that . It was rhetorical . 
Still on a social hiatus . Not bothering with my phone or any ge t-t o-gethers . These little bouts of depression I get every once in a while can last up to a few months , so PLEASE , let me be !

3 & 6 are the ones I use mostly to hug people . However , < PROPFIRST > , I think we need to practice #5 for Futurama nights . \ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6vS-V_5r4 
I have slept for almost two days , awaken for an hour or two in between , and waking up in a cold sweat and completely exausted STILL ! I'm really weak too . This is miserable . :( Going to need to get my hormones tested soon . Somethin ' just ain't right ! 
There are no stupid questions , just stupid people . \ 
\ 
Ha . 
Dearest friends and family ; Thank you SO much for you < PROPFEMALE > and well-wishes . As most of you know , getting through something difficult is nearly impossible without that little bit of knowledge that there are people out there who love you , and are waiting for you on the other side of the bridge whenever you need them . 
Sick . :( Maybe I'll feel better in the morning . 
AHA ! So , it may be my thyroid that's giving me all this trouble ! I'll know in a week or two . It makes sense ( Nudge to those who know me ) . See !? I wasn't going crazy ! Hehehehehe . Hahahahahaha . Hohohohohohoho ... THEY'RE COMING TO TAKE ME AWAY ! 
9/11 . I still remember where I was when we watched the crashes live on TV that morning . I will never forget , neither should you . 
Doctor's appointment today . :( The whole shebang and blood work . On one hand , I'm happy to finally have some answers to what the hecks going on with me . On the other hand , I have five fingers . 
I got my blood drawn . I didn't pass out . I've been talking in a ridiculous british accent for the past five hours and listening to Edwyn Collins . I played Left 4 Dead and killed my teammates , then let the zombies take me . Doctors have cold hands . I NEED TO GO TO SLEEP ! 
I wish I could be as cool as < PROPFIRST > Simmons . 
It's not my thyroid ! I just have Vitamin D Deficiancy and I'm slightly anemic ! YAY ! Vitamin D Deficiancy = Osteoporosis , heart disease , hypertension , autoimmune diseases , certain cancers , depression , chronic fatigue , and chronic pain . 
Those Charmin bears enjoy toilet paper WAY too much ... 
Lethargic . Depressed . Choppy sentences . That's about the best update I can give right now . >_< The sun isn't really helping , it just makes me sweat . At least I still have my sense of humor ... ugh ! 
Does anyone else ever have a dream that they're fighting with someone and wake up really REALLY pissed off at that person ? How about dreaming you got something cool , like a kitten , and wake up and look for it ? Or those stupid ' a baseball is being thrown at you ! DODGE!' ones , where you almost fall off the bed and startle yourself . This is what happens when you sleep 20 hours a day . >_< I'm becoming a dream expert . Ha . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > :'( It's so weird , I was just watching ' Sex and the Single Girl ' the other day . I loved < PROPFIRST > . 
You don't have to agree with being gay . You don't have to support it . But if you harass someone because they're gay , you're insecure with your own sexuality . If you're gay , lesbian , bi , trans , asexual , whatever ; there's nothing wrong with you . Don't let anyone tell you otherwise , because it's NONE of their business . >_< 
For the record , I do not enjoy writing scripts . -_- Well , some twisted , sick part of me does ... Ugh . 
There isn't anything I enjoy more than curling up with a great mystery book on a rainy night ... apart from killing zombies and saving the world , that is ... 
Sorry for being anti-social lately . Family are the only ones seeing me now . I just need to regroup and get some things done . You know how I am ( or should , by now ! ) 
I'm so glad my life is not like a musical . Seriously , I only know about 3 people who can actually sing ... guess that never stopped < PROPFIRST > Beiber or Ke$ha though ... 
I'm worried . Our cat Sassy isn't doing so well ( She's 16+) . She's acting like Fat Cat did before she passed on , which is not at all fun to watch . The worst is that she could be like this for only a day or even a few weeks before she's ready to go . Poor baby . :'( 
Dearest Friends ; You may not have seen or spoken with me since the beginning of this month . I apologize for my absence , but I'm taking a personal hiatus from socializing a lot so that I can work on changing my eating and sleeping patterns . I'm too exahusted and frusterated to really socialize outside of my family for now , but I'm still thinking about all of you every day . Love you all dearly ! <3 
Reading ' < PROPFEMALE > Karenina ' . Had to buy a version with bigger print because the one we had made me go cross-eyed ... 
I've said it once , and I'll say it again . \Fornicate the Constable ! \ " \ 
On new anti-depressant medication . Feel icky . Having a hard time remembering ... anything . I hate feeling so useless . 
OH NO ! < PROPFEMALE > seems to have brought me an early Chrismukkah present ; wisdom teeth . I feel bad for babies now . :( I'm nomming on my shirt and waiting for the advil to kick in . Golly . 
I feel like such a little kid on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > night . I can hardly sleep , I'm so excited ! It doesn't help that I've recently dropped < PROPFEMALE > Karenina for < PROPFEMALE > Drew ... 21 going on 12 ! 
iwantaperm ... 
Screw it . I'll start my diet Friday . Time for some 2am Nachos ! 
On New Year's I chopped off all my hair . ^_^ Who knew I'd actually look adorable with a pixie cut ? I didn't . 
Need a friend right now ? Me too . 
I'm just gonna start speaking with a french accent from now on . Just ' cause . It ain't against the law or nothing . Besides , how do you know I'm not really french ? Maybe I just fake an American accent ? See ? You're the stupid one . 
Playing Fallout New Vegas ... still . WHY can I never be bad ?! I always have such good < PROPFEMALE > in Fallout . Yeah , I'm totally NCR's Bitch . 
Is it wrong that when I play Fallout New Vegas I kill people with nice clothes just so I can wear them ? I just want to wear a pretty dress ! >_< 
Bought one of those ' 24 Hour Lipsticks ' that promises it won't come off ... AND IT DOESN'T! I got a fire engine red color , naturally , and I've been harrassing people by showing them that I can kiss anything and my lipstick won't smear . It even stayed on when I ate nachos ! CAN LIFE GET ANY BETTER ?! 
Had a great day yesterday , and I'm thinking the rest of this year will be eventful for me as well . I can't wait ! :D 
Another good day . :) Visited with my dear friends and got an awesome pin-up book from Badgy ( YAY ! ) Feeling social and loved again . <3 
<3 Had a blast with my girls today ! It's so nice to have good friends who make you laugh ALL day ! 
\They're coming for you Barbaraaaaaaah ! \"" 
I have 15 minutes of audio of someone turning the pages in a book on my ipod . Yes . Seriously . It's the best thing in the world . :3 Am I the only one who gets eargasms from strange sounds ?! 
Don't shoot people . Shoot zombies . 
Recieved some of the best news of my life today , reguarding my future with SSI . It was the most shocking , happiest letter I've ever recieved and for ONCE , I was speechless . :) 
Looking for an apartment , la la la ... 
The new Vanity Fair has an interview with < PROPFIRST > Bacall . <3 She's marvelous . 
Sick . >_< Not much more to say about it . Nothing witty to add . Just want to put my head on the desk and sleep . Yey .
