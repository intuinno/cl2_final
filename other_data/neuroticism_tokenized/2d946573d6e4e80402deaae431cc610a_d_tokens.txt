Rode my bike for the first time in a year , due to knee surgery . It was exhilarating ! I feel 12 years old again when I am on it !! The beach bike/skateway is the BEST !!! 
Okay , I * know * that it's a full < PROPFEMALE > , but it seems that an inordinate number of people ( especially in the extreme right-wing media seem to be particularly stuck on stupid . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > being a case in point . WTF ???

CA's ban on gay marriage was just ruled unconstitutional minutes ago . 
Oh yeah , Fiesta ... yay ... @@ 
Soooo sad ( and telling ) that Faux News was chosen over NPR :-( 
When is the SMS functionality going to be restored to my Sprint phone ( for FACEBOOK) ? 
The parade - best part of Fiesta is on !! So many magnificent horses !!! 
wants to know why her game-blocking efforts aren't working ... :-( 
Periodic spells of bank ribberies are so common in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > that a sign on the door of one bank prohibits entering wearing sunglasses , a hat or cap , and any kind of a mask . Just kidding re the mask , but the rest is true ! 
I'm so glad that everyone seems to having a great end-of-summer ! Here in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , the summer weather seems to only be beginning ! < sigh > 
A set of three Fushigi magic balls will render my life complete ( alas ! ) ...

Summer finally arrived in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , just in time for the official beginning of Fall and for the West Beach music fest ! 
I love folks from the South ! They think that they can say anything about you as long as they end the sentence with \bless your heart\ " . ROFL " 
Happy Birthday Superman ! Today is < PROPFIRST > Reeves ' birthday ... 
Hey < PROPFEMALE > Barbarians ! Per an SMS alert from KEY T-T V ( our local ABC affiliate ) , we hit a record-breaking 106 degrees today ! 
Thank you Cumulus radio for pulling KMGQ-FM off the airwaves over the weekend . I just LOVE not having jazz available during my work hours . Guess it's time to check out local NPR jazz offerings for signal strength . At least it wouldn't be canned . Gggrrr 
Well , it's a hot one ... like seven inches from the midday sun ... or so it seemed ! KEY T-T V said we hit 106 degrees yesterday , The Weather Channel quoted 109 ( must have been an airport reading ) . It's 6:30 am . and 75 degrees at Camino Alto on the Upper Riviera . Will today bring more of the same ? 
Unstable air mass over Northern Baja could bring storms aand first heavy rains of season through Sunday . Burn areas subject to flows caused by locally heavy rains . 
I wouldn't mess with the scale , I'd just go with the measuring cup . 
Children with Special Needs want what we all want- to be accepted . Can\ 
I make a request of anyone willing to post and leave this on your\ 
status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is\ 
in honor of all children who learn a little bit differently . Thank you ! 
I like it on the floor next to my bed . 
I am simply amazed at how quickly a red kane cola can settle an absolutely churlish upset stomach ! Thank you Borders !!! 
9 inches :-( 
Go Browns !!! Another rainy day , curling up with a book !! 
< PROPFEMALE > Burch 1 of every 10 people born is gay . This means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority & so much else all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to commit suicide as a way to escape . If you want to tell them life will get better & you respect them for who they are , copy & paste this . Most of you won't . 
Big thunderstorm coming in off the ocean ... 
Watched Sir < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > on THE VIEW . Forty years have zoomed by so quickly ... 
Today I am taking off on my bike and letting the day and my destination(s ) dictate it/themselves . I used to take great joy in this , in that I ran into whomever I was supposed to . It also refreshed my senses of spontaneity and renewal . Time to get back into doing that ! 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Pausch ! Yesterday would have been his 50th birthday . Thank you < PROPFIRST > for so unselfishly sharing your wisdom about life in your final days ! 
Detrashing and dusting the office today . Laundry at 2:30 . Then the real workday begins . Pictures at eleven . Just kidding about the pictures part , LOL . 
Batten down the hatches , my Ohio friends !!! Big winds are coming to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > tonight too ! But thunderstorms in Northeast Ohio in late October ????? 
Watching MSNBC , they are ripping the Tea Party candidates a new one ! 
Out-of-control brushfire burning @ Vandenberg AFB , buildings and unexploded ordnance at risk . 
Watching the kids parade through Borders in their costumes , too cute ! 
Trick or treat !!! Happy Halloween y'all! 
I hope that my FB fiends are having a spooktacular Halloween !!! 
94 degrees on Wednesday , 87 on Thursday and 80 degrees today . Unbelievable ! 
THANK YOU < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Planning Commission for your integrity , wisdom and Enlightenment in your decision supporting the efforts and continued operation of Casa < PROPFEMALE > ! Also a very big THANK YOU to CE director < PROPFIRST > Foley !!! 
At Borders , just saw a guy eith a tee shirt that said \Uzi does it . \"" 
Found out today that I am not over the upper respiratory virus that I contracted over the summer , despite my best efforts to get better . Will be following up with additional tests and work-ups toward resolution of whatever is hanging on . 
Thanks to all of the US veterans and their families ! Your courage and your sacrifice are a significant aspect of what makes this such a great country . We salute you ! 
I am soooo bummed , found out today that my beloved downtown SB Borders store is closing in early January , they lost their lease . :-( 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and ... 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support good people ....... 
My cell phone died a slow and painful death in the washing machine on Sunday . The new phone will be challenging to master !!! 
Happy Turkey Day all y'all! 
I'm surprised to find myself enjoying the brisk early mornings of late ! :-) 
Sitting at the downtown SB Borders store , watching the checkout line externded almost to the back of the store ... 
The Lake < PROPFEMALE > cam is working again , yay !!! I can see the lights on the gazebo !!! Woohoo !!! 
The holiday season always makes me homesick for Northeast Ohio ... until I see the pictures , video and radar screens of the weather there . then I am glad that it's been 67 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > all week and that I can ride my bike ... 
** NEW FACEBOOK GAME ** Inbox me your Bank Account or Credit Card number ( be sure to give me the expiration date and 3 digit security code ) and I \ 
will post in my status which < PROPMALE > I paid with it , or which Christmas \ 
gift I purchased . Just like the < PROPFIRST > Game ... let the messages begin ! 
Per < PROPMALE > James : Wonder and despair are two sides of a spinning coin . When you open yourself to one , you open yourself to the other . You discover a capacity for joy that wasn’t in you before . Wonder is the promise of restoration : as deeply as you dive , so may you rise . \

Thanks < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Will you all be willing to donate your status for just a few minutes to HONOR a fallen < PROPFEMALE > who's just passed away while serving our country ? Cpl . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( USMC ) of Akron , Ohio Died December 6 while serving in Afghanistan .

Here come those < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > winds again . So glad that a week of our MIA summer was returned to us ! A week in the 70s , gotta love it !!! 
Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised !! Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first !!!! 1% will re-post and 99% of the people on Facebook won't hav ... e the spine and or guts to re-post this to their wall . I KNOW I'm the 1% , how about you ? 
< PROPFEMALE > IV launch from Vandenberg was AWESOME !!! 
One of every 10 ppl are born gay . That means 1 person in 10 will be put down , given bad labels , they will feel alone , bullied , all for something they don't yet understand . Many gay teens are going to commit suicide as a way of escape . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect and love them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . Respect is love ! 
Cousins are the 1st friends of your life . Cousins are there as childhood friends . No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins ... even if you don't talk much lately .... Re-post this if you have some of the best cousins in the world ... and they know who they are !! 
Per the 1/31/11 edition of ohio.com, a policy change means that Akron's < PROPMALE > Hywet Hall & Gardens , acknowledging its link with the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous will no longer host events where drinking alcohol is the main activity . \ 
Consequently , the estate will no longer host the Blues & Brews event nor wine tastings , which had previously held at < PROPMALE > Hywet over the years . 
Wishing my friends and family in Ohio safe passage through the ' monster ' snow storm . Stay at home if you can possibly ! 
~ ? Only an AUNT can love like a mommy , keep secrets like a sister , and behave like a friend . If you are an AUNT who loves your nieces and nephews repost this !! Loooove my beautiful , handsome & smart nieces & nephews ? ~ 
71 degrees tomorrow and 73 on Sunday ... I think that I can live with that . 
73 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > , go Steelers !!! 
We have daffodils !! In bloom !! 
Per my friends < PROPFIRST > Nicely and < PROPFEMALE > Lehman : We're asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if YOU or SOMEONE you love has DIABETES . I know my family will . We hope that in 2011 a CURE will be found . Will YOU post it , just for one hour ? Do it for all of us in memory of too many to mention and in honor of all fighting it ! 
Per < PROPFEMALE > Lehman : This year July has 5 Fridays 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This apparently happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So send this on and money will arrive in 5 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui the one who does not pass this on will have money troubles for the rest of the year ... 
<3 <3 Happy Valentines Day to all of you sweeties ! Today is your day ! <3 <3 
Snooow on the mooouuuntains < to the tune of ' Smoke on the Water > 
It's cool and < PROPFEMALE > , but ah , the scent of the blooming night < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I wish heaven had a phone .... so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today ... but that's nothing new . I thought of you yesterday and days before that too . I think of you in silence and often speak your name . All I have are memories and pictures in a frame ... I love and miss you Shel .... 10-7-03 ..... re-post if you have someone whom you miss . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is gone ?
