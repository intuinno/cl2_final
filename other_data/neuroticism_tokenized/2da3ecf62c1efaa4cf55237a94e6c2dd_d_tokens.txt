Nuuuuuu regents .... whoever made the regents can take that test booklet and shove it up their ass . 
I think .. I just .. screwed myself over on the bio regents . Now to fuck up my geometry regents tomorrow . fml ^^ 
Making me write in pen on the regents is almost the dumbest thing you can do if you've seen my handwriting . I make so many mistakes that I start crossing things out and then it looks like a bunch of scribbles .

Bored and hot .. bleh x_x 
* sigh * .... 
Afff SAT practice tomorrow >_< 
i kinda feel like i'm going insane .. but maybe that's just the heat and me having to read this ridculous book that i have to take notes on ... fml >_>

I was at < PROPFEMALE>'s with my mom today .. and she asked the weirdest question ... Are you gay ? ._. 
Wish I was 3 or something again >_> things were so much simpler .. only thing I had to worry about was whether or not my mom would kill me when she finds out I broke something ... well actually I still worry about that now .. and other stuff ._. 
It's funny watching people walk around with plastic bags over their heads on rainy days when they don't have umbrellas xD 
Grrr ... >=[ 
Hmm I realized that I haven't celebrated my birthday since I was like ... 7 ._. 
That's just great . My mom lost my student ID card -_- She said she was gonna put it somewhere safe and she winds up forgetting where she put it . And she yells at me when I lose things .. she just doesn't realize how easy it is to lose stuff >_> 
I dunno why but people at the summer school thingy think < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > is either my brother or my bf ._. Wtf ..?? 
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuu onemanga.com is gonna shut down T_T ... where am I gonna read my manga ?!?!! DD: 
I are confuzzled ...

I want < PROPFEMALE > cakes ... 
Half way through my math midterm I gave up .. I left like most of the packet blank x_x ... I are grouchy today ..... 
Can someone please make my mind shut up ? 
Blehh xPP 
* hides under the covers * o.o

Well today was kinda annoying . Had a new teacher for English today and she talks really loud ... I'm sitting near the front so it's like she's shouting in my ear ... then I had to take another practice SAT for 3 hours so I'm just really grouchy now ^_^ 
So ... got my \midterm\ " report card ... my english teacher said my exam grades are inconsistent with my homework grades ... I dunno where she's getting that from .. they're about the same lol . My math teacher wrote that I had good math skills ... are you kidding me ? lol I failed most of his quizzes or barely passed . Today was just ... okay for once o_o I think I ate too much ... x_x " 
I needs to stop writing on myself with pen ... and it's not on purpose either ._. I has pen marks on my knee and my hands ... >_> 
-I'm here again A thousand < PROPMALE > away from you A broken mess , just scattered pieces of who I am I tried so hard Thought I could do this on my own I've lost so much along the way Then I'll see your face I know I'm finally yours I find everything I thought I lost before You call my name I come to you in pieces So you can make me whole- hmm been listening to that lately x_x 
I've come undone But you make sense of who I am Like puzzle pieces in your eye- 
Oh I had a lot to say was thinking on my time away\ 
I missed you and things weren't the same\ 
Cause everything inside it never comes out right\ 
And when I see you cry it makes me want to die -> I think I watch too many Kahlan/Richard AMVs >_>

So there's a fly in my room yet again except this time I can't kill it cuz my mom thinks it could be my grandmother . ... In all seriousness I doubt it , but it sucks that I can't kill the damned thing . And if that really is my grandmother lol .. out of ALL the animals in the world she decides to be a disgusting ugly fly ... that's just reaaaal nice . 
My mind hurts reaaaally badly >_<

UGH !!! I can't fucking draw * rips my sketch book up * 
< PROPMALE > how dare you kill all my magical friends D:< 
What a crappy morning . 
The weather is retarded ... why can't it snow when there is school . There's no point in it snowing now ... it's past Christmas and I'm on break . Stupid weather =_= 
Nightmares are just so much fun . 
I don't wanna sleep =/ 
In a clear view there's a silhouette\ 
And I watch you and I can't forget\ 
Yeah I figured it out now\ 
Breakin's what the heart is for 
Wish I had a tablet ... but then again I wish for a lot of things ._. 
just had some tea . So not getting any sleep tonight :) 
Ughhh I feel like crap x_x 
Ugh finals . I'm going to shoot myself -_- 
My brain is officially fried . 
What if it makes you question every moment you cannot see ? \ 
And what if it makes you crash\ 
And you can’t find the key ? -Safetysuit 
Finals ... * crawls under the covers and hides there ._. * 
Lol , on my way home on the train I saw this old lady who was wearing stuff that was all green o_o . She had a yellow-green jacket , shoes , green pants , green backpack with a ... stuffed frog in it ..?? ( o_O ) , and erm ... green gloves . Oh and she had green highlights in her hair and green hair clips xD \ 
Awesome right ? 
' Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all 
Yay finals are done ... but now my stomach hurts D: 
I hate how my mom calls me a retard for asking stupid questions . Yet last night , she kept asking me the same fucking question about her credit report letters and each time I answered her she'd just nod like she understands then ask the same thing again . Who's retarded now ? Obviously not me . 
feeling a little angry and sad =/ I hate today . 
I've decided that I don't like today either ... 
I think Blom is on crack when he grades my stuff lol . 
\The Narrator refers to how noobs grow . \ " I wrote two o's by accident and I went over it and made an \ " m\ " but you can barely see it so it's read as noobs instead of mobs rofl ( took me like 10 minutes to figure out that I meant to write mobs ) . Me and my awesome handwriting that nobody can read ... not even me sometimes ._. " 
Ahh nothing like waking up late in the morning cuz my mom forgot to set the alarm and running out the door to find the ground frozen solid . I must have almost slipped like 12039834723 times while walking to the train station . And to top it off , my math teacher wasn't even there so I rushed to school for nothing . Great morning I must say . Best I've ever had . 
Grawr I can't focus ._. 
Ugh I wish I didn't have hw . I wanna draw :( * is sad * 
I'm so pissed right now . 
Oi I failz at using acrylic paint lol . 
Can't wait till break , I'm just dying here x_x 
Lol < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > you should have seen your face when you dropped your donut xD 
Soo .... people came to the house for New Year's and stuff ... and their son and his girlfriend brought their puppy with them . It's a husky and she was so cute :D The only thing was that she kept trying to bite me when she licks my hand ._. \ 
I want a doggie D: 
Noooo Spaceeeeeeeeeey o_o 
Yesh spacey ? o_o 
Ashita wa nihongo no tesuto ga arimasu . Demo , benkyou o shimasen ._. ... In other words ... I'm screwed for my Japanese test tomorrow xD 
< PROPMALE > o.o 
Eh , I dunno what to draw :/ 
got a haircut today :o 
Ahh omg it's Thursday D: 
Going to bed at 12-2 am every day is bad idea . I feel even crappier in the morning :D 
I hate my hair > < 
Homework ? ... What homework ? :) 
Mmm ... Yams . 
I think I'm getting sick . Can't stop coughing D: 
Yesterday was hell\ 
But Today I'm fine without you\ 
Runaway this time without you\ 
And all I ever thought you would be , \ 
That face is tearing holes in me again 
No internet :( 
My throat doesn't hurt so much anymore but now I think I have alleriges . I've been sneezing like crazy ... and I have no internet ... what a hellish week 
* sigh * :/ 
I'm back 
I'm so getting iced coffee in the morning tomorrow >:D 
Bought an awesome key chain from final fantasy XIII :D -Lightning's gunblade <3 
I hate working in groups sometimes . For some reason , I always get stuck with most of the work . It's cuz I'm Asian isn't it ? :O 
I feel really depressed for some reason now x_x 
Sometimes I'm bold and brash ; and sometimes I'm prone to crash\ 
Sometimes I say too much ; and sometimes it's not enough ~ Safetysuit :D 
Math test tomorrow and Global on Tuesday ... so not ready : < 
My Global notes suck , cuz Sudduth sucks . So now I'm just gonna fail the writing portion of his test and possibly pass his multiple choice if he doesn't kill me with his ever so \picky\ " questions . * sigh * School should go to hell or something . Fucking waste of my time . " 
My mom forgot her cell ... again , so now it's ringing like crazy > < 
Yay I < PROPFIRST > Kahlan :DD and it's 1:19 am ! I'm so gonna feel like shit later x_x
