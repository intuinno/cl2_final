it's tax time and i did my first one tonight , irs won't except the e-file until the 15th , state wouldn't e-file yet at all and no date when it can , this guy i did tonight is always my first client , then he usally gets his state in under 5 days . just some fyi . 

I realize i did not post about < PROPMALE > being so sick the last week and a half . in and out of the hospital since last wed . still do not know the cause of him passing out at work twice in three days , they did a whole ton of tests , EKG , CHEST X-RAYS , CAT SCAN , SPINAL TAP , MRI , BLOOD GASES WHILE SLEEPING . 
they think he was dehydrated and that may be why he pasted out at work twice in three days , with all the tests they still are not sure what happened , going to be hard , 2 weeks with out pay checks , and 8 graves to plant flowers on before Memorial day , need to go really cheap this year . 
any one close to me will know that it will be five years tomorrow since my sister < PROPFEMALE > died , will be a hard day for me , my life has been so effected by her death . plus i miss her so much ... well wish me luck with his primary Dr. letting return to work , because it's not our usaul primary and she's going to have to do allot of reading , with the angio in feb . and knee surgery , now this . fingers crossed everyone . 
Planned on going back to bed after < PROPMALE > left for work at 4 this morning , but it is now after nine and still no nap , only my laptop , will be 3-4 hrs . to get all the critters up , fed and cleaned up after . I start Pt next week on my spine plus epadural injections , not real excited about the prospect of them , but anything has to help the pain , thier is no pain killer i have had that'll work on the pain , 
I'm really getting into facebook , just not the gaming , I average 4-5 hours of sleep a night helping take care of < PROPMALE > , they still don't know why he was passing out at work and recently here at home . but it's finally taking it's toll on me . Oh and to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , thanks for going along with < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > on the chicken scam's , your all big shits . \ 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > got a good laugh , 
Happy Fathers day to all the Dad's , Father's and Stepdads , most inportant to me , is my husband < PROPMALE > and my only child < PROPFIRST > both have earned the the award for both being the world's greatest Dad and Stepdad , Happy Father's day to the two most inportant men in my life . I love you both ... 
I've decided to re-think my decisions not to let my friends and family know about my back condishion , I'm not posting for a pity party or for anyone to feel sorry for me . just some old fashioned luck today and maybe a few prayers for my future . 
I have a condishion called Spinal Stenosis , there is no cure only pain management and trying to keep me out of a chair , Thanks < PROPFIRST > for offering to soup up a chair for me with spinners and the works , love ya 
11:25 taking my meds and going to sleep , hopefully a full night for a change with todays injection , legs are still tingleing . nite to everyone . 
Instead of posting about my continued back condishion I commented on one of my post that I shared to explain the details of my injection yesterday and the out come and the finding for the rest of my MRI . that's where you can read the full report , thanks everyone . 
< PROPFIRST > how do you copy something to put on your profile , also did you get all moved ? I sent the video to my e-mail and was able to open it just fine . I'm doing my test now , takes 3 1/2 hrs to compleat . < PROPMALE > disapeared some where when I was in for the first 32 scans . Now the slow tread mill . Then the meds . That will make me have a hot flash LOL . Talk to you later ,

Kids\ 
with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicap \ 
is not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and \ 
loved . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it\ 
as your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education week . This\ 
... is in honor of ALL kids with special needs . See More 
Keep this going !! Heavenly Father , as we embark upon this a new year , walk through my home and take away all my worries and any illnesses ; and please watch and protect my family and friends . In Jesus name , Amen . This prayer is so powerful , stop what you're doing and set this to your status . Watch what He will do !! 
My Husband has made me laugh . Wiped my tears . Hugged me tight . Saved my life . Watched me succeed . Seen me fail . Cheered me on . Kept me going strong . Put up with my mood swings . Has said everything will be ok when things get tough . Keeps me sane . My Husband is a promise from God that I will have a friend forever . Put this as your status ... if you love your husband !! 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I fell more in love the minute you were born , then I saw your face and fell in love even more . You were only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your ? to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ! 
Days of sadness may come and go , be careful letting feelings show . Too much pain to endure alone , embrace the love of others shown . Take life optimistically and you shall see , that this world can be a great place to be . \ 
I just copied this from < PROPFIRST > , how true this statement is . 
Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > 
ok < PROPFIRST > , you can un-tag this picture , i was not aware i looked anything like smudge . although some may think so , i've gotten allot of feed back from it . banana bread and cookies are done now , reap the rewards and re-name this picture .
