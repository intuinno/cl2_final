What the deuce is twitter ? This social networking stuff is getting out of hand ! If it were up to me , we would all go back to writing letters to one another and all mail would be delivered on wagons pulled by oxen ... Ah , simplicity : ) 

You must make your choice . Either this man was , and is , the Son of God : or else a madman or something worse . You can shut Him up for a fool , you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon ; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God . But let us not

\I embrance the sight of pain/ These medicines are just poisons by another name/ and if its time to play the game/ then let's border on insane/ as i recklessley abandon all atachments to me/ I touch the sun while you touch the rain// Where is the sting ? / where are the fangs that haunted me ? / Where is the sting ? / This is the Shot heard ' round the world \""

To whoever felt prompted to leave 2 bags of groceries on my family's porch last night , thank you SO much !! You blessed us more than you could ever know ! : ) 
Loving the judger is the only way to break the cycle . A never ending judgment cycle just distracts us with each other and takes our focus off the real judge and His insane love for us . \Love always wins . \ " I need to choose to love people that I judge to be judgemental ... I wanna love like Jesus does . " 
How many of us have a mindset that says its wrong to judge and condemn others but when we come across someone that is overly judgmental we find an exception for them . I DEFINITELY feel convicted for doing this ! Judging the judger doesn't make my judgment a just one . It makes me a hypocrite . 
you are more than the choices that you’ve made\ 
you are more than the sum of your past mistakes\ 
you are more than the problems you create\ 
you’ve been remade 
MAN NIGHT TONIGHT !! ROAR !!! Red meat WILL be eaten .
