I'm broke but m happy , i'm high but m grounded , i'm sane but m overwhelmed , i'm lost but m hopeful , i'm here but m really gone , i'm sad but m laughing , I care but m restless , i'm scared but m strong , I'm free but m focused , I'm green but m wise , I'm hard but m friendly , I've got one hand in my pocket & the other is flicking a cigarette what it all comes down to is tht I haven't got it all figured out just yet ...
