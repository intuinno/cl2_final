< PROPFEMALE>'s Official How to not be hated in Parke County List : tip 1 ... If you see a large moving metal object walking infront of it might be a bad idea ..... brake petals and gas petals suddenly are easily confussed . tip 2 ... Locals do not mind answering questions and would love to teach you the difference between living where you do and here , but before you ask us please ask a friend and see if it's a stupid question .

I don't need to walk a mile in your shoes . I can see you're a train wreck from all the way over here . 
Got sliced open . Walkin funny . But im doin good 
Just got home from the hospital doin good just sore 
the hardest but most rewarding job in the world is a single parent .. its twice the workload and twice the sacrifice .. but it also comes with twice the rewards 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat , the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , and to this day , I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life itself . 
If I wanted certain people to see what i was doing or saying on facebook I would have them on my friends list and would not have blocked them . You know who you are so you can shut up and stop starting shit . 
is feeling suprisingly alot better . I was expecting to hurt ALOT worst than I actually do . 
is bored ......... kids asleep , homework offically done , hmmmmmmm what to do ....... 
Poor little guy woke up with a fever and getting sick ....... I just hope it is that 24 hour bug and not the flu that last forever ! I don't think hes moved from the couch 
Just got little man in from the hospital , thought for a second he was going to have to go thru the who IV thang . Thankfully the strept test came back negative and its just a bit of the flu . Thank God for antivomit meds bc i was soooooo over that already . He keepin everything down and already sayin how much better hes feeling . Now just to keep an eye on his throat 
Special needs kids are not sick , gross or stupid . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this & leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education Week , and this is in honor of all kids made in a unique way 
You and I wake up in jail together . Using only FOUR words , what would you say to me ? NOTE : If you comment , you gotta copy and paste this in your status so I can comment on yours ! Fair is fair . Play along 
is a sassy talking , flip flop wearing , chocolate eating , Sunkist drinking kinda girl but right now I'm more tired than a fat kid chasing an ice cream truck . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! Have a safe and wonderful holiday ! God bless ! 
Just sitting here hanging out with Bryland . He's drawing and just talking to me about random things and i am seeing more and more how funny he is . 
So Bryland picked out racecars that are balloon powered that were a dollar each for him and the other kids to play with and the cars have entertained the younger kids better than if he would have picked a huge 50 dollar toy ...... don't you love how that works . 
Ok its snowed im over it ....... it can go away now 
I love how God provides . When ur in need the most help He always sends what u need when u least expect it . 
The group asking everyone to change their profile picture to their favorite cartoon is actually a group of pedophiles . They're doing it because kids will accept their friend request if they see a cartoon . Nothing to do with supporting child violence .. Its on Tonights News . Pass this on to everyone who has a cartoon profile picture 
Mmmmmm pumkin pie . So good i dont care im driving ten mph behind a snow plow . All thanks to < PROPMALE > !

I sat back and looked at my life today and I am so pleased with how it is going . Great job , good man , awsome family and friends , doing good in school and best of all an amazing son . Where I am at right now I didn't even know was possible . Thank you to my friends , family and man . I don't think much could make it any better right now . 
*** Every Christmas you always hear people saying what they want and bought . Well this is what i want : I want people who are sick with no cure to be able to be cured . I want children with no families , to be adopted . I want people to never have to worry about food and shelter & heat . Now , lets see how many people re-post this who actually care . I have a feeling I am gonna see almost no re-posts 
Just got my new computer up and running , just one more download and i am so done for today . thank you to all who made today what it was ...... merry christmas to all of you . 
keeping presents away is something i am officially horrible at ! lol ' santa ' dropped off bryland's christmas presents at work today and said since he was so good this year he gets them a little early . he got this cool remote control racecar that he loves . it's so cute watching him play with it . 
Everything is over and done with . Bryland got some really cool gifts ....... I might have to check out once he's asleep . Funny thing is right now he's having more fun with the bubble wrap . lmao 
Today wasn't to bad considering I had to be at work at 6am . I got to let loose on the milk delivery guy that is such a pain in my rear with his attitude and then kick someone out that was yelling about just nonsense . Wasn't happy about getting up that early but atleast I got to let my frustrations out ! 
AT WORK AND IM BORED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
i was absolutely amazed today , a 19 yr with a baby came in with her mom and wanted a hat we sell . begged for it sayin mommy mommy please buy it for me . and when her mom reminded the 19 yr old she needed to put gas in the car for work she said she didnt know if she could but would pay her back for the hat ....... 
Finally got to sit down and my body officially hates me and is reminding me how old i am getting . my legs , back , ankles and feet r killing me . not to mention i still havent discovered this sleep stuff everyone keeps talking about . 
thats it who pissed the weather off this time and making us get snow again ? 
To be a good mother you must put your child first ....... so why do i feel punished for doing that ? Ugh ......... got lots of thinking to do now 
ACCHOO !!!........? (- ??? • ? ) ?....... If you're allergic to bullcrap , drama queens , head games , liars , 2 faced fake people - keep this sneeze going ... I can't wait to see who reposts this !!!!!!! 
School starts again tomarrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yay I am sooooooo excited 
YAY i survived the first day of balancing work and school !

Just had 2 amazing conversations . One with my son's daycare and the other with who watched me as a kid . Got great advice from them both !!!!!! Scarey part is I realized I'm as close to who watches my son as my ........ mom was to who watched me . Crap . Sorry daycare we can't be friends anymore . I refuse to be like my mother . Lmbo but I still love ya 
Bryland's new fav phrase ...... Here you go my good man . And i don't even know where he's heard that before . 
Homework for the week done ! Now to start on notes for next week . The great part is the more I do my psych the more I LOVE the subject ! Medical Terminology on the other hand if anyone want to do that class for me ....... I wouldn't be upset at the least ....... 
So I was just talking to Bryland about the color white . He was telling me what all could be white . I asked if dinosours could be and white and he looked at me like I done lost my mind and says , ' Mom don't be kidding me .... No . ' 
So Bryland's phrase of the day ........ half boy half kid all fun ! Lmbo

So for psychology class I must find a case study that involved animals . As I am reading thru the studies what I am seeing tested out on humans is far worst than any animal . ( Even tho the animal test get pretty yucky ) Even tho I do not condone animal testing by any means , why do people put themselves through this kind of what I would call life long ' torture ' I wonder ?

My psych homework is done ....... I think I did a great job ...... but I still feel yucky on the subject after having to research it , still hard to understand why people put themselves through all that . 
Do you ever find yourself sometimes reading what people think and wonder if your in the twilight zone ???? Are people that niave ??? 
You have to love kids ! It's even better when they tell on Grandma ! lol 
At times I wonder how people can actually make it into college when they can not follow directions on simple assignment ?

Is it bad I love reading the discussion boards in class just so I can have a good laugh ???? 
I hate it when people use their kids as a weapon to hurt others ' feelings . Kids are to be loved , not used as weapons . 
I just fried up some bacon . It was so think the first batch I wasnt sure if I cooked it long enough so I cut it in the middle . Lol 
It is difficult for me to be amazed by people's stupidity and yet today I was so amazed I was almost speachless , key word almost ........ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
When we first got our DVR I thought great now we can fast forward commercials ! Now that Bryland knows how to work it I think crap now he can pause on every commercial for his ultimate wish list ....... that gets longer and longer every cartoon 
Ok seriously why do you need a 3 foot word to say bruise ? Seriously ? What's the point ???? 
AAAHHHHH gotta love american idol flops !!!!!!!!!! 
is wondering why kids suddenly remember something amazingly important they HAVE to do as soon as you say it's time for bed !! 
So it's official I love fb stalking people ! Lmao . 
PROMISE TO MY CHILDREN : I will stalk you , flip out on you , lecture you , drive you crazy , be your worst nightmare and hunt you down like a bloodhound when needed ... because I LOVE YOU ! When you understand that , I will know you are a responsible adult . You will NEVER find someone who loves you , prays for you , cares about you , and worries about you more than ME !! Re-post if you love your children . 
Yay I just checked my student account ! Financial Aid should be here SOON !!!!!!!!!!

Bryland just looked outside and says , ' Ugh there's still snow outside , will spring hurry up and get here . ' lol it's bad even when the kids start getting the sick of the snow . 
I would like all my facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right , just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . ( this could be fun !! 
So I caught Bryland looking in the mirror at his armpit today . So I watched for a second and then asked ummm whatcha doing ? He looks at me dead serious and says , ' Mom it bout time I become a man , so I am looking for hair on my armpit because that's what happens when you become a man . ' then comes over and hugs me and says ' But I'll always be your baby . ' 
So it's official I STRONGLY VERY STRONGLY dislike sponge < PROPMALE > now that Bryland has been home most the week 
I am sick of watching people using others for their own personal gain . You know who you are and you need to stop saying outlandish things about people who were good to you . All I can say is you better stop and get you head out your rear because it is going to all boil over with people in the family you really don't want it to .

REPOST this if you're PROUD of WHO YOU ARE 
Just got home from having a blast swimming with < PROPFEMALE > Green and then had a great time at dinner with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > !
