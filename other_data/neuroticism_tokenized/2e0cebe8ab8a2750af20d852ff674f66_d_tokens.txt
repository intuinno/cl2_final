When I grow up and become a famous animator ... I'm going to make my own arcade . =_= 
My parents told me that no matter what , I shouldn't hate people ( especially family ) no matter what they did to you , it's all in the past . Never regret anything and move on , never hold any grudges over what they did , otherwise , you'll feel bad with hate inside and you won't have no one to count on when others will be gone . 
My feet was swollen from yesterday and right now it's covered in blisters ( my parents told me to wear shoes instead of sandals ... ) right now it just hurts when I walk lol ^_^ 
Halftime show was AWESOME !!!!!!!! XD 
Google Chrome ... omg this makes searching fast lol :D (* sigh * I have an old computer ... )
