You'll sit and long forever if you wait for the right time . What are you hoping for ? 

Hello , Facebook 
Tear it up , Drogba 
Holyeffingcrap , this is actually happening ... 
¡México ! ¡Ya se armó ! 
Weezer's World Cup song : pure genius 
weird ass day ... 
No cell reception in English ... Dammit , T-Mobile ... 
Anyone have any ideas for a constitutional amendment ? Any serious ideas ? Your help and a clear explanation would be greatly appreciated . 
¡Mexico ! ¡Ya se armo ! 
This shit is shameful . You're so much better than this , Mexico . 
Fuck yeah ! You're not leaving with a clean slate , bitches . 
Si , valio madre , pero hay birria . 
Stupid English class ... 
Four hour English discussions are an exercise in futility . How many times does everyone have to agree with the professor before I can assume I'm in a class full of sadists ? I want to take a nap ... 
< PROPFIRST > Eat World makes any drive an amazing one . 
Quod me non necat me confirmat , brosef . 
\Hate\ " does not even begin to describe how I feel about my car right now ... " 
The things you make me wanna do ... 
It's nice to know you work alone . 
This is the part that sucks : waiting . 
How many times do I have to opt out of getting email notifications before Facebook stops spamming me ? FUCK , IT'S ANNOYING ! 
Spain , nooo !!! 
Fuck yeah !! Casillas is a fucking pimp . Spain is still in it ! 
Gooooooooooooooooooooal ! 
Thank you , Casillas . You are a man among men . 
Well you sipped from the cup but you don't own up to anything . 
Studying up on landmark Supreme Court decisions on the 4th of July . I love this country :) I love our constitution even more . I do , however , hate my poli sci class . 
Summertiiiiiime and the livin's easy .... 
I want an internship at the straight up gas institute 
This is what I have been reduced to : watching YouTube videos about things that I know are going to annoy me , just to avoid studying for Poli Sci . Procrastination is in my blood . 
T-Mobile may not have the best coverage , but their customer service is absolutely amazing . So worth it . 
Let's go Spain !!! 
Suck on that , Germany . 
I would like to thank the earth for gently rocking me while I nap . 
Ever get the feeling the people around you don't take you as seriously as they say ? Something's going to have to change . 
You think you're cooler than me . 
Rockin ' the Casbah , Rock the Casbah 
Had me some sushi today . I am in an amazingly good mood now . 
¡España ! 
¡Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool ! 
\Dude were like the < PROPFIRST > of Fullerton College [ ... ] UCSD is our Notre Dame\ " - < PROPMALE > Gonzalez " 
God , I hate night classes . 
Locked out on exam day . FML 
Beautiful southern California day , chill breeze , shady parking spot , and Sublime on my stereo : perfection . 
The people in my english class are hilarious . Its like a roast in here . 
Its so fucking hot in here !! 
I just phone kissed < PROPFEMALE > Magee 
So , California , I was wondering : would it be ok if you toned it down a few degrees ? 76-80 degrees would be amazing . No ? Well , I still love you . 
... 
Inception was so good . Seriously , DiCaprio has a monopoly on amazing movies . Now , to write a paper I've been procrastinating on . 
I watch The Real Housewives Of New Jersey !!! 
Very productive day :) 
I really need to sleep . My eyelid's been twitching like crazy today . So annoying . 
Deus ex machina : nonexistent plot device in my life . Let's just cut to me at UCSD ... 
For better or for worse , I'm done with poli sci ... 
Must ... stop ... procrastinating ... 
I can't believe that just happened . I actually got into everything ... 
LA Galaxy game with < PROPFEMALE > . They're losing , but good times . 
So its official : I am either going to be an ostrich or a llama farmer . Plans have been discussed . Hello rest of my life . 
IT'S SO FLUFFY !! 
Kansas City Wizards vs . Manchester United ... I love Sundays . 
Flashing your phone is a trying experience ... 
Now running Android 2.1 on my Motorola Cliq . Suck it , Motorola and T-Mobile . 
IN-N-OUT drive-thru : a good opportunity to ponder the big questions in life . After all , you'll have the time . 
UCSD : please , let me in . I will do anything . I need to be at UCSD . 
3-2 against Manchester United . 
This is fact , not fiction 
Geoff Rickly played the tenor sax in high school . Thursday ftw . 
Today is not a fun day . Way too much to think about . 
\I felt like a piece of meat ... \ " - < PROPMALE > Gonzalez " 
Can't sleep . I wonder why ... 
If I don't make it through school , I'm opening a pet shop . Freaking puppies sell themselves . Seriously , who says no to a puppy ? Heartless communists , that's who . 
Until you start , you don't know how good you are , and before it ends you won't know how bad you were . Either way , you have a reason to try . 
I want a duck . 
Open mouth , insert foot : story of my life . 
Awesome night . TPFL ... 
When we were made we were set apart . 
< PROPMALE > Hernandez wins the game against < PROPFEMALE > FC for Manchester United . I'm so conflicted ... 
The Ataris at Chain Reaction this Thursday . I'm so there . Who's down ? 
Listening to the new < PROPFIRST > Eat World . Love it . 
Contrary to what my < PROPFEMALE > used to say , I did not graduate from high school in ' 10 . California High School Class of ' 07 , thank you very much . 
SD trip today to get some motivation going , and damn , I am motivated . Came home to a helicopter and some LA Sheriff . Even more motivation to get out of this crappy town . 
Ataris show tonight ! 
Oh , < PROPFIRST > Roe , if I could , I would buy you a neon . 
Being grown up ... 
The Ataris were amazing at chain reaction . Round 2 tomorrow , then once more on Sunday . It's the \stalk < PROPFIRST > Roe\ " weekend . " 
This crowd sucks ... 
Don't you understand that what I say is true ? I just want you to know I have a < PROPMALE > crush on you . I'll meet you in October and do the things you wanna do ; I'd even have < PROPFIRST > Roe dedicate a song to you . 
Might be flaking on The Ataris show in Hesperia . Sorry < PROPFIRST > . 
Orange dream machine from Jamba Juice . Perfect for the last day of summer . 
Why did no one tell me about tofu earlier ? I have been missing out . 
Fall 2010 finally started . Almost out ... 
< PROPFIRST > Roe's signature has officially disappeared from the back of my phone . Autograph fail . 
Chem professor is still not here . 11 more minutes ... 
Brazil may have great football clubs , but their fans have no class . You don't spit on an opposing player , and you don't disrespect their national anthem . Congrats on the tainted victory , Inter . Demand better from your fans . 
Screw the mosque . Forget the memorial . Let's launch missiles from ground zero . That's a good way to honor the memory . Plus , missiles are phallic , so we can finally show the world how obscenely large < PROPFEMALE>'s penis is . 
Goooooooooooooool ! Bofihno !! 
This class is soooo boring !!!!! 
Always happy to have a House-induced moment of clarity . 
Everyone's a mechanic ... 
Chivas game and a sushi platter : win . 
Fuck my chem class ... 
I want a mol of pennies ... 
Thanks to some news from < PROPFEMALE > Magee , I am now smiling so wide it's probably freaking people out . 
Cannot get enough of \Rocket Skates . \ " Its looking like it will be on repeat forever . " 
7AM math classes should be illegal . 
After all the recommendations I have made for your products , why have you forsaken me , HP ? 
= w = XD 
Gonna get my iced Passion tea on ... 
Its shaping up to be a Sinatra kind of night . There will be singing . We need to bring this stuff back . \

God bless the man or team of men who developed GPS technology . 
\Spiders aren't insects 
Bass Ale and good company . Love it . 
Sleeeeeeeeeepy ... 
This is just ridiculous . Is the semester over yet ? 
That actually went really well . Time to step it up for calc . 
Mexico vs . Colombia : ¡Ya se armo ! 
There are < PROPFEMALE > droplets of water falling from the sky , ladies and gentlemen . Don't panic . Apparently , this is what people call \rain . \"" 
Reason #500 for my hating math : it gets in the way of my awesome conversations with < PROPFEMALE > Magee . It just gets in the way , period . I'm making this beef public : I hate you , calculus . 
Just brewed like a liter of the blackest coffee I've ever seen . Your ass is mine , calculus ... 
I've done all I can ... time to hope for the best . 
Sometimes the universe cuts you a break ; mine was in the form of a multiple choice calculus test that was so easy I finished and left campus before security had a < PROPMALE > to ticket me for not having a permit . Not to mention I got home in time to avoid a street sweeping ticket . I think this calls for a victory nap . 
Google.com 
Freaking brosefs , always coming through for guy . This guy . Love those two guys . 
Good news : I haven't failed any tests . Bad news : I wasn't exactly stellar on them either . Looks like I'm gonna be a Phoenix . 
What was looking to be a pretty crappy day has actually turned out to be a very good one , thanks to a stroke of good luck and < PROPFEMALE > Magee . 
Chivas Guadalajara vs Chivas USA . :D 
Congratulations to Mexico on its independence and its bicentennial celebration . ¡Viva Mexico ! 
Freaking pointless English paper , gotta keep me up all night ... \ 
God , I hate my English class so much . 
I . Fucking . Hate . This . Class . 
If you feel discouraged , like there's a lack of color here ... 
House premiere !!! Its . Finally . Here . Holyfuckingshit ! 
Oh , chem lab , please end ? \ 
I have a phone call I really want to make :)

Five Finger Death Punch : awesome name for a band , and awesome cover of \Bad Company . \ " \ 
It goes in one ear and right out the other ; people talking shit but you know I never bother . In one ear and right out the other ; people talking shit : they can kiss the back of my hand . \ 
You know who you are . \ 
Also , that song is awesome . 
111 degrees . In September . Fuck this weather ... it should be cold . Dammit , it should be COLD ! 
I hear the voices in my head ; I swear to God it sounds like they're snoring . But if you're bored then you're boring ; the agony and the irony , they're killing me . 
Just submitted my TAG ... Must sleep ... 
\Flyy me to the mooon ... \ " \ 
I . Love . This . Weather . \ 
Gonna be hanging out here , with some tea and homework . Good times . 
House is on in half an hour . Longest half-hour ever . \ 
But seriously , today is a good day . 
Don't eat the fish . 
Another day spent buried in a book . Is it the rest of my life yet ? 
I love it when you finish an exam knowing more than you did when you started it ; I just learned implicit differentiation and the right way to apply chain rule from an exam on those two very things . \ 
Gotta love multiple choice math exams . 
Decent in calculus , crappy in bio , a win at A&R ; all in all , today was a wash . \ 
Screw it , I'll take what I can get . I have a feeling my day's going to get a whole lot better in a few minutes :D 
I will not bow . I will not break .

Homework and a weekend to prepare for . This is going to make for a busy Sunday . 
I put a spell on youuuuu ... 
Soooooooo , it's Tuesday . And it rained a pretty good amount . And tomorrow's Wednesday . And the day after is Thursday . Yeah , I know ; I'm happy , too . \ 
:D 
Not only is it way too early for this class , it makes you sleepy . That and today is a bad day to expect me to pay any sort of attention in class . 
Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod ... 
Amazing . 
Boo . 
¡Ya se armooooo ! Chivas , son . 
Fucking French tourist walking around like they own the place . Who smokes at the zoo ? Go home , pepe < PROPFEMALE > bitch .

Conan debuts on TBS , a new episode of House airs , and the HTC HD7 goes on sale ; tomorrow will be a good day to be me . 
Got a date with the DMV tomorrow . Lame . 
I need to learn Flagpole Sitta on guitar , because it won't leave my head . 
So the HTC HD7 and I got some alone time tonight . It was made for me , I swear . \ 
I . Need . It . 
My most sincere thanks to < PROPMALE > Ayson Jr , < PROPMALE > Hernandez , < PROPMALE > Gonzalez , and all other former and current military personnel . Your sense of duty and patriotism are what make me proud to be an American .

Now , back to studying ... 
I freaking love Urban Dictionary .

Not a big fan of anything going on right now ... 
Talk , talking a lot , but it's still talk . 
Oh , this dope nose . 
Useless . 
\You bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck . \ " \ 
So glad House is a rerun tonight . No distactions . 
Last all-nighter of the semester . Let's do this . 
Killed the bio exam . Feels damn good , too . 
There's a lesson to be learned here ... 
I wonder if they train Verizon customer representatives to be such dicks . If so , mission accomplished , Verizon . Bravo .

Love the new Social Distortion album ... 
Things I learned today :\ 
-My math professor likes to start the class BEFORE the official start time , so I should not be 2 minutes late when there's a quiz . \ 
-Ladies is pimps , too . \ 
I've the Jigga Man to thank for the last one . 
... and even with the lights out we'll glow . 
Productivity ? \ 
Check . 
I like to keep things honest ; I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it . \ 
For real . 
I despise math . 
What a difference a professor makes . I just had the most amazing math epiphany ever . 
But my brain knows better . It picks you up and turns you around . 
Microsoft : thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou\

Don't ask why , don't cry , don't make a scene . We've done nothing wrong , \ 
but we've done nothing . It's second nature to say : \Hey 
Apparently , entrance to sporting events requires you to leave your class and dignity at home . Honestly , its not like YOU won they game , you just sat in the arena , ate , and drank . How about behaving like a fucking person once the game is over ?

Take a risk . Jump into something you've got a good feeling about , because a year from now , you might be looking back at one of the best decisions you ever made . It's a good feeling . \
