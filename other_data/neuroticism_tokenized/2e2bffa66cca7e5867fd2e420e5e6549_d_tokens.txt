Roses are red , sometimes they're dead ... I think if I got a letter like this , my eyes would've BLED ! 

Sha-la-la-la-la-la ! Don't be scared , you got the mood prepared , go on and kiss the girl . Whoa , whoa ! Sha-la-la-la-la-la ! Don't stop now ! Don't try to hide it now , you wanna kiss the girl . Whoa , whoa ! Sha-la-la-la-la-la ! Float along , and listen to the song , the song say kiss the girl . Whoa , whoa ! Sha-la-la-la-la-la ! Music play , do what the music say , you gotta kiss the girl . 
You don't know cause you're too busy reading labels , you're missing all the action underneath my table , ooh ~ I'm waiting for my turn , just waiting for my turn . Maybe there's a devil or something like it inside ~ A jealous angel , deep inside me . 
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
My horse is awesome . :DDDD And ... so is Whyp . :o 
just got off work , and has a horrible head ache , oh , lawdy . 
Arigatou to < PROPFEMALE > ni iwareru to nanda < PROPFEMALE > setsunai , sayounara no ato mo tokeru mahou . Awaku horonigai ~ 
hates laptops . >:/ 
There is no way on earth or in heaven that Jurassic Park : Operation < PROPFEMALE > costs $245 freaking dollars . It's an outrage , I say ! OUTRAGE ! >:( 
Eight and a half hours of work ... aaaaa 
generally like CRAP . Sick , sick , sick .. throat hurts , head pounding , naseous ... and work in an hour ... Ugh . 
is officially a biohazard . CAUTION : STREP THROAT ... ;_; 
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly . It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep , cause everything is never as it seems . 
We gotta stop looking at the hands on the time we've been given . Every seconds counts on a clock that's tickin ' , we gotta live like we're dying . We gotta tell ' em that we love ' em while we got the < PROPMALE > . 
Ugh ... Sleepless nights . :/ Thank you stress and anxiety for completely trashing me . 
Another one of them good ol'e sleepless nights . Horrah !.. Yup ... Totally ... Uh-huh ... I'm ... gonna go draw a picture now ... And ... Be awake and stuff . :( 
Okay . So I watched Twilight : New < PROPFEMALE > . ( I'm so ashamed of myself . ) And here's my thoughts on that movie . I hate < PROPFEMALE > . I hate < PROPFEMALE > . I hate < PROPFEMALE > . I hate < PROPFEMALE > . I hate her , I hate her , I hate her . 
Why do all the awesome guys get killed in movies ? Kaplan gets eaten by the slimy pile of genetic goop and Mikey gets mauled by zombies . It isn't fair ! IT ISN'T FAIR ! Ooh , Mikey . ;_; Why the Aussie ? Of all people ... 
regrets not going to the tournament to see her friends . :( I miss you guuuuuys . 
Don't ever think that it's too late . When you care about someone , there is always room for change . You're allowed to make mistakes , it's a part of every life . I don't see you any different . I will always be your friend , I know who you are inside . I am with you ' til the end . 
Yesterday was the worse day of my life , and the pain won't go away ... ;_; 
I spent all evening with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > last night . : > It was fun and made me feel a little better . < PROPMALE > was spoiled with love and apples and treats and more love . < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > . But I still miss < PROPFEMALE > : c 
Call me old fashion , but I'm in to guys who don't put video games before their girlfriends . 
And so the search for an LDS Prom Date begins ..! 
OUTRAGEOUS 
I found the most beautiful dress ever , it's perfect and absolutely beautiful and it's mine ! I had so much fun shopping with Cam and April today ! And other surprises got me this evening ! :D Nothing can ruin today . 
We were strangers on a crazy adventure . Never dreaming how our dreams would come true . Now here we stand , unafraid of the future . Life is a road and I wanna keep going . Love is a river , I wanna keep flowing . I'll be there when the world stops turning , I'll be there when the storm is through . At the end I want to be standing at the beginning with you . 
It's you and me moving at the speed of light into eternity . Tonight is the night , feel the < PROPFEMALE > and the rhythm of the music around you . It's like I waited my whole life for this one night , it's gonna be you , me , and the dance floor . 
Long ago in the ancient passed , I remember a life when we first met . In a dark shadow realm under a big full < PROPFEMALE > , I could tell that you would try to break my will . But now watch as I rise to a whole new height and a mad battle cry will be heard all night . 
-- When the world is engulfed in darkness , and hopeless woe . His gun will toll a dreadful dirge . And so the hound will weave the final chapter in this tale of life . 
My hands are sore from shoveling stalls all day . Happy day , happy day . Also ... I scraped my knees while jumping on the Avatar bandwagon . :( 
< PROPFIRST > Coffman , you may win the poking battle . But you will never win the war . ilu 
My everything hurts . RAD whooped my butt . Not to mention my ankle is stiffer than a 2x4 . D: My poor ankle . 
Coughing ... more coughing ... Sore throat ... more coughing . :( 
Of course not , you're a senator ! You wouldn't know anything about prostitution ! 
I'd like to thank the kind gentleman that attributed to the injury of my left ankle . Thanks to that previous injury which weakened my ankle , I've injured it yet again and this time it's worse . Now I'm stuck on crutches for a week or more and an ankle brace for even longer . Now I can't ride for at least a week , I can't go see my friends , I can't go play card games . I can't do anything . Screw my life , I hate this game ! 
It's like catching lightning , the chances of finding someone like you ... 
saw the most beautiful thing . Pouring down rain , outstanding streaks of lightning , loud claps of thunder ... And the sun was shining brightly . 
-- Today ... \ 
Felt like a total waste ... It was a total waste . 
While weeding the front yard . I stirred up exactly a kazillion pill bugs , rehomed two very pissed off earth worms and four salamanders , came face to face with one extremely disgruntled spider , had to pick up and throw away a dead baby bird with hedge clippers ... And there's still a crap-ton to do ... What I wouldn't do for a weed eater . 
I think I'm ready to get back in the saddle again ... 
WON A GOLDFISH !!! 
cursed out a deer today . 
< PROPMALE > Thomson HAS NO PANCAKE MIX ! >:( 
I love it when I can't sleep . That's when the coolest drawings and comics happen . 
Who the heck wakes up at 4:00 am ? Apparently , me . 
blub-blub-blub-blub ... drowning in a puddle of depression . :( 
had a picnic with < PROPFEMALE > Vulgamott , went on a trail ride , saw some deer , got thrown off < PROPMALE > , and had to call the farrier because < PROPMALE > threw a shoe when she ran off . Today was a good day . 
is drowning in boredom ... Someone , cure this . 
-- I'm so stressed , and there isn't a thing I can do right now to fix that . Which really bites , to be honest . Not to mention , I find myself a little on the ... nervous side ... Wish I could go riding and just forget all my cares ... 
-- I was sitting behind the podium and I was feeling fine , hardly nervous at all . But then Sister < PROPMALE > leaned over and whispered \Good luck . \ " \ 
-- I was getting ready to help my mom straighten her hair ... And then the hair straightener slipped out of my hands . And closed around my wrist . \ 
\ 
Anyone ever seen seared flesh before ? I can now say , I have . 
-- I'll be your Kaiba if you be my Yuugi ! ;) 
Pirate speak on Facebook ? Excellent . 
-- House and dog sitting this weekend in the most amazing house ever . If you need to get a hold of me , call or text me . I have unlimited minutes/texts . ( 717 ) 977-7604 
-- Against the grain should be a way of life , ' cause what's worth the price is always worth the fight . 
-- Last night was a great change of pace from the horrible and stress week this has been . For a few hours , I got to just relax and enjoy myself at the mall and a movie with a really great friend . :) Thanks , < PROPFIRST > . 
-- I was disappointed that < PROPMALE > Poppycock ended up in 4th place . I'll admit he did take his last performance a little too seriously , he could've fluffed it up a bit more . But he still deserved to win , darn it ! It was disappointing that Fighting Gravity didn't make it further either , but I did see the mistake that Piers was talking about . < PROPFIRST > Grimm isn't a headliner , but , congratulations to him , nonetheless . 
-- Today was a good day . 
-- It only took two hours to scrub the asphalt paint off my poor , sunburned skin ..! Hopefully it'll tan ... Meh , I'm ready for more good days ! This week needs to get movin ' along !

-- Will this week be as great as last week ? I surely hope so ! 
-- I got a feelin ' that tonight's gonna be a good , good night ~ Woo , hoo ! :D 
-- Last night was so much fun ! The perfect recipe for a perfect night : Amazing friends , UP , sitting around and having a laugh or ten , and PIT until midnight . That's how we do it ! 
-- The one time we decided not to park right in front of our house was like , the best decision ever . Some guy fell asleep at the wheel and nailed our neighbor's car , then that car started a domino effect and hit the car in front of it . That would've been bye-bye Cavalier if we parked there . 
-- There's nothing like looking up at the sky to talk about the < PROPFEMALE > s with someone special just in time for you both to see a shooting < PROPFEMALE > . Tonight was good . :) 
-- Spent the night browsing at the Chambersburg mall , American Eagle , dinner at Moe's South Western Grill , and a movie to end the night along with construction on the highway ! Perfect way to end a marvelous evening . :D 
-- As usual , I got screwed . \ 
And now , it looks like I can't keep < PROPMALE > ... I hate my life ... 
-- Today was one of those days ... Kind of crummy . The bridal shower was sorta fun , but goodness , I never felt so young before ... I could use a healthy dose of cheering up ! Hopefully the week will start on a good note ... 
-- DeviantArt why must you add so many useless features and cause everyone so much lag ? Why , dA ? Why ? 
-- I love TGI Fridays . It makes Wednesdays greater . I especially like how < PROPFIRST > Skulimoski cries when soda comes out his nose . LOL <3 
-- \He's G-A-YMCA ! \ " < PROPMALE > Python's SpamALOT was kind of hilarious ! " 
-- Is anyone not busy tomorrow during the day between like 10:00 am and 3:00 pm and wouldn't mind getting a little dirty ? :D I could use some help painting a lot fences . 
-- This is amusing . And probably true . \I could never stay mad at you\ " actually means \ " cross me & I will drop you like an AT&T call . \"" 
-- Oh , the conversations that can be had while eating McDonalds food ... 
-- Oh , man ! I can access Facebook from my phone ! Cool . :D 
-- < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows comes out in four days ! Oh , man ! dowant ! DOWANT ! 
-- Spent the day shopping and browsing the mall with < PROPFEMALE > Whitlock , < PROPFEMALE > Helman , and < PROPFEMALE > Helman ... It was pretty fun ! :D 
-- Today is going to be amazing ! :D Going out for a romantic day with < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > Potter tonight ! -Excite ! EXCITE !!!!! - 
-- Between the hibachi chef throwing a piece of chicken down my shirt , meeting a guy with a punch bug completely dedicated with < PROPFEMALE > Parton memorabilia with her autograph on the roof , and < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows . Today was friggin ' amazing !!! 
-- Great green gobs of greasy , grimy gopher guts , mutilated monkey meat , chopped up < PROPFEMALE > feet ! French fried eyeballs swimming in a pool of blood -- Mommy , I forgot my straw ! 
-- Spent Thanksgiving with the Daniels family . < PROPFEMALE > Ahlstrom Daniels is such a fabulous cook and the meal she and her family prepared was nothing less than perfection ! We visited some of the Daniels ' neighbors , which were awesome people , and their houses were AMAZING ! ( Note to self : Balcony INSIDE house , French doors = Perfect House , completed . ) 
-- Oh , man ! ... It's this many , till ten ..! 
-- My voice is still in such cruddy shape from the cold I had a week ago , I can't hit an F sharp to save my life ! :( Disappoint ..! 
-- So , I've discovered I'm very good at something besides signing , drawing , and riding . And that is ; spilling soda on things that shouldn't have soda spilt on them . For example : < PROPFIRST>'s car , my desk , and my shoes . And the week isn't even over yet . 
-- It was so cold today ! But , I'm glad I got to ride my horse and spend time with her ! And beat < PROPFIRST > up , because he's a douche bag and needs to learn not to be mean to his short mommy ; otherwise he has to deal with auntie < PROPFEMALE > who won't deal with his crap and will show him what real nightmares are made of . :D Oh , ho , ho ! I love horses ! 
-- Tonight was a good night . 
-- I'd love nothing more than to spend Christmas with the two people I love most , but of course . Compromise , what the heck is that ? ;) 
-- Hm , who knows . Maybe the holidays will go well . For once . I wanna go riding though ... Don't wanna wait till tomorrow ! :( 
-- I stayed up last night to watch the lunar eclipse , it was so pretty ! 
-- I can't believe Christmas is less than a week away . It still seems like there's so much to do , though ! Ugh ... At least I got to ride < PROPMALE > today . 
-- I love < PROPFIRST > Cartwright . Bonanza is awesome . 
-- I had so much fun riding ! :) < PROPMALE > was so lovable and she was such an angel tonight ! 
-- What a looong day . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! :D ( Inside joke : That's the fourth time . ;)) 
-- Ugh , I feel like junk ... My nose is actually chapped from blowing it so much . I hope I'm better by next weekend . :/ 
-- Let me love you down . Baby , I can break you down . There's so many ways to love you . You've got me like , oh , my gosh . I'm so in love , I found you finally . You make me wanna say ; oh , my gosh . 
-- What a slow day ! I wish I could go riding , I miss my horse ! 
-- Tonight is going to be amazing , and tomorrow just as !!! I gotta feelin ' that tonight's gonna be a good , good night ! HECK YEAH ! 
-- How the heck am I suppose to know that ? ... The general tells you . Oh ... I killed him . 
-- The past 48 hours have included : Puking my guts out , sleep , more puking , a lot more sleep . More sleep , sleep , sleep . More sleep . A little more puking . Sleep , sleep , sleep . More sleep . Waking up . A little more sleep . Slipping down icy porch steps . Scraping my ankle . Sleep . Facebook ... I'm thinking I might try some food , now ... I haven't eaten for two days . :( 
-- I'll be hopped up on pills all week . Awesome . Hello , six days of Prednisone . And Phenergan , and an inhaler for however long ... Look at the bright side . At lease I'm not contagious . 
-- And I wonder if I ever cross your mind ? For me , it happens all the time . It's a quarter after one , I'm all alone and I need you now . 
-- I have a very high tolerance for stupid . But some people are beginning to take advantage of that . 
-- Alone on a Saturday night with nothing to do and no one to talk to ... Fantastic . 
-- Today , Christian gave me a < PROPFEMALE > made out of a tissue ..! Which seems nice and all , but I'm wondering if the tissue was contaminated or something ... 
-- My . Heart . Stops . When you look at me . Just one touch , now baby , I believe . This is real , so let's take a < PROPMALE > and don't ever look back ~ 
-- Today was pretty good ..! Except , < PROPFIRST>'s sick ... I hope you get better soon , love ! <3 But , I got to see my cousin for the first time in like , forever ! It's good reconnecting with family that you just love so much ! :) 
-- Ugh ..! Why hasn't anyone been replying to any of my text messages ? Do my friends just not like me , anymore ? D: 
-- Something is wrong with my phone , when I plug it in to charge it , it says it's charging but the battery won't hold a charge . My phone won't even turn on now ... Guess it's time for a new battery ? 
-- Hello , lovelies ! It turns out that my new phone decided to dump my entire contact list , so I unfortunately lost all of your < PROPFIRST > ! If it isn't too much trouble , please send me a message here on facebook ( Private , of course ;)) with your number so I can reenter you into my phone ! :) Thanks , guys ! 
-- Haha , so change of plan ! My phone ... spontaneously started working so . Please text me your number if you can ! Lol :) Thanks guys , sorry for all the hassle ! 
-- Tonight , it's just you and me . And honestly , that's everything I need . 
-- I love how what would have been a 10 minute journey turned in to a 30 minute quest for civilization . All because < PROPFIRST > doesn't know his lefts from his rights . :D 
-- Epic face . Epic face . Epic face . Epic face . ... This fox is clearly a registered sex offender ...

-- I think people need to stop stepping on my toes , learn their place , and back off . :) 
-- Is today over yet ? No ? How about now ? :/ 
-- It's funny how they always assume you hate them , yet want to be friends after they rip your guts out . 
-- \How are you not dehydrated ? Shouldn't you just be weeping little grains of salt by now ? \ " I love my friends ... :( " 
-- Had a super special awesome day with < PROPFIRST > Stull ..! Couldn't have asked for a better day . :) 
-- < PROPFEMALE > Ray : You don't understand . I've been waiting for this for over a year . Like , you don't even know . You don't even KNOW ! \
