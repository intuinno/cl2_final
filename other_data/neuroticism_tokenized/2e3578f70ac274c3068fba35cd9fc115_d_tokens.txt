I purposely haven't moved my legs in over a minute and its freezing in here . My right foot is completely numb and the toes on my left foot are stinging . This is awesome . 
I have a laptop ! Its SO AWESOME ! 
You know what they say , nothin ' makes a boy a man more than the quility of his laptop compared to his friends ' laptops . 
Georges Bizet is NOT the guy in my picture , just to be clear . 
Guys and gals ! I don't know what to do . Anything . Gimme an idea . 
Escalator spin isn't a meme

You are all good people . Except for that thing sitting next to you . 
Did anyone else wake up earlier than that thought ? I don't know why ... usually on the weekends I wake up around 10:30 -11 but today I woke up at 8 . I guess its because my brain is all \OH SHIT DUDE YOU GOT SHIT TO DO\ " but then I'm like \ " Wow bro its k no need to flip your shit . \ " so my guy is all \ " Oh thats pretty k but since your awake you should like to stuff . \ " so I got up and did some stuff . Soooooooooooooo ? " 
How did I wake up EVEN EARLIER today ?! BEFORE 7 !! I DON'T UNDERSTAND ! 
Who wants to have a good ol ' ge t-t ogether ?

Anybody interested in buying an xbox with a few games for $200 ? ( hey eddie : I told my friends ) 
The new version of < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland would make the other of Through the Looking Glass very disappointed in so many ways ... Hated that movie even when I tried to like it .... 
Spending my whole day watching Lost on netflix . Not much longer till driver's < PROPMALE > and summerschool . Who else is going ? 
Part one . The twi-tards are about to rise again . We , as a unified retaliation , must do something . For too long now this has gone on . We have sat by and watched as the twinklers scream and cry over < PROPFIRST > . We all hate it , yet all we do is say so . Why do we let this continue ? Today , is the day my friends . Today we make a stand . Today we make a difference . Time to take action .

likes that sound you can make in your throat that sounds like a bassy zipper ... or a very fast but bad bass player ... or a dying frog ....

For those who fight valiantly with their foam and duct tape .... You must now refer to me as ....................... T Coon . Or else you might just get your squirrels in a bucket ... if you know what I mean . 
Now for all you racist and terrible people out there who thought that when I used the phrase T Coon , insisting that that is what you must call me from now on , I was NOT referring to the racial slur , I was referring to a raccoon ... and that makes you ... a terrible , terrible hunk of scum and racism . Rou have brought shame to rour famary an all a rour ansestas , an rou get da < PROPFEMALE > prus . Rou ruse . 
I wanna be , the very best ... like no one ever was ! 
The bus can be a scary ass place , and I don't think I shall ever look at it the same again . I used to think it was a cool place where you can sit and think . Hard to do that now . 
my long hair is coming along pretty well 
Ask and you shall receive . 
If you think I should change from biology to drama scream aye ! at the top of your lungs ! If you think I should do something else whisper it reeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaally quietly .

I like my nose . It rounds out my face and almost looks cartoonish . ( intended combination of almost and -ish suffix ) 
My thoughts when I arrived on facebook at 6:49 PM on a Sunday : LOL WTF WHY IS < PROPFEMALE > FOX ONE OF MY RECOMMENDED PAGES wait seriously wtf why do six of my friends like it .... 
I'm off to see the wizard ! 
So I found this show called Scrappers and its hilarious . Its juts a bunch of stereotypical New York/Boston types collecting junk to make money . Its freakin ' sweet . 
So like ... who the hell hacked into my facebook account ?

Just take a seat . Right over there -> \ 
You must now sit on whatever is to your right for the remainder of the time you spend on the computer today . \ 
Enjoy boys and girls . 
I am Iron Man . 
To all the PC Gamers out there , I got me two < PROPMALE > keys to the closed beta for Bloodline Champions . First come first serve . \ 
That's not what she said . 
What do you want to know more about ? 
So guys , I think candlejack died :/\ 
I haven't seen anyone get < PROPFEMALE > - 
Everyone who wishes to save the dying breed that is Music say Aye . 
Dad : Seriously you guys , be quiet . Your mother is trying to sleep . You're out here stompin ' around-\ 
Me : Well I couldn't even hear the documentary cause < PROPFIRST > over here-\ 
Dad : Well your mom can't even hear herself sleep ! 
Why does my little chat box say only one friend is online right now , when I know there are others ? Who is online right now ? 
Pick a random day sometime in the near future to record yourself doing nothing out of the ordinary . Just put a camera somewhere , and forget it . Emphasis on forget it . Don't act , or do anything for the camera . It will be curious to see what others do regularly ... however slightly weird I guess . If your cool with it though , it might be interesting . I would have made an event of this , but that wouldn't be a random day . 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH ! Its late and I want to play guitar but my parents are sleeping ! FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU 
\I have never let my schooling interfere with my education\ " - < PROPFIRST > Twain " 
hates it when you are glancing around and happen to look at someone a split second before they look at you so they think you were staring at them . 
It would be awesome to meet < PROPFIRST > Twain . Just to be able to take a glance at his brain , and view his knowledge . It would probably turn into less of a glance , though . More of a thorough study . 
So some people are asking to be told something others always wanted to tell them . Tell me something you never wanted to tell me . 
List of songs that should be more popular but aren't because the world of today is musically retarded . I'll start us with a few winners . \ 
The Helios Sequence - Shed your Love\ 
The High Kings - The Parting Glass ( I know it isn't by them)\ 
< PROPFIRST > Debussy - Rêverie\ 
Snow Patrol - You could be Happy\ 
Clutch - El Jefe 
Its disappointing how when I am asked in French what I like to play on guitar , and say The Muffin Man by < PROPFIRST > Zappa , the whole class falls into awkward silence because they ALL think I mean the nursery rhyme ... wtf people . Not gonna ever bother explaining it to the lot either .... 
ANOTHER Pirates of the Caribbean movie ? I thought we were done with this .... 
The stars and planets are almost aligned ! START THE GENERATOR ! 
FUCK YOU CLOUDS . THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST INCONVENIENT TIME FOR YOU TO EXIST . I WILL ALWAYS HATE YOU . 
lied on a roof with < PROPFIRST > Dodd , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Harmon while wearing only a t shirt , gym shorts , and sneakers . It was awesome . 
I've created something amazing ... \ 
The Bacon Gravy and Cheese Sandwich . \ 
The BGC . 
GAH . I wish the rest of my family was awake >:[ 
I'm not going to wish you a good/merry/happy anything because its what everyone does . I just gotta be difrinte . \ 
I got a 20hz < PROPMALE > Cube Guitar Amp . \ 
and some other things . 
I've slept so little in the past two days ... \ 
feels weird man . 
My new profile pic\ 
First time I've changed it in almost a year . Includes :\ 
poor lighting , full view of face , only me , no special pose , unrehearsed , and pretty much everything else you don't expect to see in a facebook profile pic . \ 
I think it describes me pretty well . 
Who's email do I not have ? 
new profile pic again\ 
I did some sweet editing . I have a few versions , like smoother edges n stuff . \ 
Graphic editing is kinda fun . 
So I'm trying to find my long lost friend Braulio < PROPFIRST > . I searched his name on facebook , and most of my results were latino poeple , which is his ethnicity . When I search his dad , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , I get a bunch of black dudes . \ 
??????????? 
Gimme somethin ' extreme . \ 
I mean EXTREME . 
I know the gas burns , and I know there are plenty of places you'd rather be than one where you can hardly see twenty yards , or the top of your boot poking drowning in the mud , but through these lazy clouds and across that fence are men who have the power to make this the place many others much would rather be 
The Guitar is the Ultimate Instrument . \ 
The Guitar is used in just about every last genre of music , unlike just about any other instrument ( percussion doesn't count ) . The guitar is everywhere . From the heavy metal electric fire breathing demon down to the furry acoustic deer , the guitar is everywhere . 
Favorite people in ever so far :\

Quotes are some of the most amazing things . Not just because it can teach a lesson , or say something interesting , but because that is one's final and direct thought or opinion . To be able to read pages of other's thoughts is like swimming through their brain . You are able to know and understand someone without ever having met them . 
Why the hell does everyone care so damn much about those stupid zodiac signs ?! 
I'm sad now . I sent my long lost friend a friend request , and he hasn't accepted , even though he has obviously been on since I sent it , because his profile pic is different . \ 
I really , really hope he just didn't notice it ... or something . I really hope he didn't press the \I don't know this person\ " button . \ 
Up really late\ 
All my friends gone to bed\ 
Maybe I'll just wait ... \

GOOD . Next I will teach you dirt dogs how to properly salute ! THIS is the proper form for a salute !! You WILL salute WHENEVER you hear this sound ! \

I guess today is smooth groove day for me today . I've come up with two awesome and groovy bass lines . They would probably sound a lot better if I had a bass to play them on . They're so ... \

Awesome movie , amirite ? 
Hi . 
awakens in a dimly lit room . There is a COMPUTER DESK and a BARRED WINDOW with the SHUTTERS closed . Exits are EAST . 
You awaken in a dimly lit , stone hallway . To one direction is a heavy metal door , to your sides are two more doors and a bulletin board , and the other direction the hallway continues . You have no memory of where you are , how you got there , and begin to panic as you are unsure of who you are . 
What genre of movie is your life , and what kind of people would watch it ? Any synonym for awesome cannot answer either question . \ 
Psychological Documentary\

should I bring my acoustic to school ? 
Alright ... so I suppose imma try to get my acoustic to school tomorrow . If I get it there , I'll be playing during lunch . I don't know where . Don't expect anything . I seriously doubt any requests will be fulfilled .

You know , I think for my birthday party weekend , I'll < PROPFEMALE > with friends , we'll see a movie , and then wonder around town . Sounds like a pretty chill celebration , especially because almost nothing about it is out of the ordinary . Just celebrating life . 
It is actually a type of mental disorder to not be able to show emotions or talk about problems when taken to a certain severity . I believe the same could be said for those who never stop complaining . 
Pretty sweet birthday . 
It's a confusing world . Tell us what's on your mind .
