Yesterday we had a great time visiting the American Museum of Natural History again . We've even become members . We looked at a lot of different types of shells , saw more of the Hall of Human Origins ( we're about half way through that one ) , and an IMAX movie on the Great Lakes . Then we ate at a nice restaurant , < PROPFEMALE>'s , since we had to wait for a wheelchair cab . 

< PROPFEMALE > is being admitted to the hospital again for a biopsy tomorrow . It looks as though she may be having another episode of liver rejection . It's an uncomfortable hassle , and it means we'll be in New York longer , but we expect with treatment she'll be better soon . 
< PROPFEMALE > will be at Mt . Sinai Hospital here in NYC for 7 days while they treat her with high doses of immunosuppressants . As JuLane says , this is not unusual after a transplant . It's snowing here ! 
In answer to < PROPFEMALE>'s question , < PROPFEMALE>'s spirits are up and down . She very much wants to be back in Texas with her friends and life there . News of delays is upsetting , but she adjusts pretty quickly . The Prednisone she's taking to prevent organ rejection plays havoc with her moods . 
In further answer to < PROPFEMALE>'s question , I'm usually fine . We both enjoy New York . The thing that helps < PROPFEMALE > the most is distractions . There are fun things to do in the hospital since she's in a pediatric section . When she's out of the hospital , there are many good opportunities for distraction . 
Thanks everyone for your thoughts , wishes , and prayers . 
< PROPFEMALE > was released from the hospital yesterday evening . We are back at the Transplant Living Center and she is doing fine . 
Thanks for the birthay wishes ! I feel lucky to have such thoughtful friends . It was great to celebrate with my family back together in < PROPFIRST > . 
Leaving for San < PROPMALE > this a.m. 
children with special needs only want what we all want : to be accepted . can i request anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? it is special education week , and this is in honor of all the children who learn a little differently . \ " , 2010-10-22 22:12:26 " 
Daughter < PROPFEMALE>'s 1 year Transplantiversary !
