ACHACHACHACHACHA ... have to get up super early tomorrow for debateee ... i am going to regret this hyper spell at 7 am tomorrow . 
has to do math & chemistry today ... no fun :/ 
why am i always the initiator ? i have to invite people over , i have to make plans , nobody ever texts or messages me , i have to start all the freaking conversations . what the hell is up with that ? 
going to go do my favoritist thing everrrr ... BAKE COOKIES ;D 
so yesterday at wah < PROPFEMALE > , i opened my fortune cookie and it said my lucky number was 4 . so i figure , today is the 4th , and when the day ends the broncos should be 4-0 . i am so pumped up right now . i'm going to go take a shower , then listen to 850 KOA ( broncos radio ) all morning until kickoff . GO BRONCOS !!!!! BRING THE PRESSURE ELVISSS . 
the broncos move to FOUR-0 on the FOURTH of october , by taking the lead and beating the cowboys in the FOURTH quarter . also in the game ... champ made his FOURTY-FOURTH interception !!! so excited ... GO BRONCOS :D now all those stupid \pros\ " can't say we've only beaten easy teams ... THE ORANGE CRUSH IS BACK ! " 
' i guess that's how this one's gonna go , i'll be the giver and you'll be the taker ... you've got me down on my knees and i proclaim , all hail the heartbreaker ' 
i can't seem to function , from this far away . and every little moment looks so dull , without your color in my day . 
GO BRONCOS !! 5-0 baby !! if we can beat the patriots , anything is possible . lovee you mom ;) 
:(

who wants to improve my weekend by giving it plans ? ( : COME WATCH NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND BAKE HALLOWEEN CUPCAKES WITH MEEE ! hahahahah sounds like a blasty blast right ? enticing , yes ? (x 
you know how sometimes you hear a song , and it brings you back to some random time in your life that you were obsessed with that song ? i love when that happens . unfortunately the song poker face is bringin me back haha 
i still love you broncos . though , next week i would appreciate it if you slaughtered pittsburgh . 
i have a date with desperate housewives & a lonely twix bar sitting on my dresser (: 
why is tuesday necessary ? monday is , because it's the crap that makes the rest of the days seem like heaven . wednesday is necessary because it's the day you realize you only have two more days until the weekend , thursday is very nice because you're nearly to friday , fridays are STELLAR ! saturday is the best day of the week(no school today OR tomorrow ) . sunday is game day . tuesday is just ... there . :/ 
i am the worst procrastinator ever . now i'm stuck writing a paper , doing math homework , and researching nfl picks all night ... it's okay , tomorrow will be stellarrrr (: 
so i was sitting here listening to my ipod on shuffle , rocking out to slipknot's ' all hope is gone ' . then ' radar ' by < PROPFEMALE > spears comes on . after about a 3 second pause with a blank look on my face , i proceeded to sing along with dear < PROPFEMALE > . I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW , KNOW , I'M CHECKIN YOU SO HOT SO HOT WONDER IF HE KNOWS HE'S ON MY RADAR ON MY RADAR ... hahaha 
' sometimes i get so mad that your not here i want to throw you in oncoming traffic , but then i remember i'd probably kill myself trying to save you . '

at this very minute , i am wearing a skirt . this is because i was doing some latin dancing . said skirt doesn't look too shabby , but nobody will ever , ever witness this . just thought i should let you know . 
close your eyes . close your eyes . picture a dark room ... in the middle of the room is a turtle . it knows all the answers to all your questions . this turtle is purple , just for a random bit of trivia . ask the turtle a question .

you know what pisses me off more than anything ? people who don't feel like they're special enough just on their own , so they have to copy every aspect of your life , right down to the very last detail . be your freaking self . ( i know i'm supposed to be flattered but COME ON !!! ) 
briskly & dapperly 
i smell grilled cheese ... weirdest figment of imagination ever . 
hellooo how are you .. give me the salmon or i will destroy you 
llamas with hats completes my life .

the family went shopping ... i think it's time i do the risky business < PROPMALE > cruise thing for the first time in my life . 
i want to swim away but don't know how , sometimes it feels just like i'm falling in the ocean 
going to do some cleaning , take a shower ... and then get ready for some football ! GO BRONCOS :D 
you are better than this crap you're pulling broncos . i'm pissed that mcdaniels even started orton when it got down to a 20 pt game . if orton got hit ONCE the wrong way , he would be out for the season . also , i know you're injured orton , but come on . you weren't much better than simms today . and i am most dissapointed in our defense ... where did you guys go ? my faith remains in you broncos , but my dissapointment grows . 
lather rinse repeat 
come on skinny love just last the year , pour a little salt we were never here . my , my , my , my , my , my , my , my ... staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer . i tell my love to wreck it all , cut out all the ropes and let me fall . my , my , my , my , my , my , my , my ... right in this moment this order's tall 
is thankful for family , food , and the < PROPMALE > BRONCOS (: going to go eat thanksgiving dinnerrr ... smells DELOVELY :D afterward it's time for some THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL !! GO BRONCOS 
i knew there was a reason i kept the faith ... i love you broncos . 
meet me on the equinox 
up with your turret ... aren't we just terrified ? shale , screen your worry ... from what you won't ever find 
sometimes the monotony of chewing gum pisses me off . so does the impossibility of becoming entirely invisible for a day . wouldn't that be wonderous ? 
sorry i let you down , sorry it wasn't quite true ... but don't get < PROPMALE > up on it just soldier on with it , and good luck with shooting the < PROPFEMALE > 
it's crazy how much things can change in a single year ... & i can't decide if i like it or not . 
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY MY DEEEEEAR < PROPFEMALE > !! i can't say OH MY GOSH I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS , cause that seems like way too short of a time ... pretty much feels like forty . heeehehehheheheeeeeeeeeehehe ... xD I LOVE YOU < PROPFIRST > MUCHO !!!!
