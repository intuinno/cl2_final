' Wind Chill : 22 ' \ 
Parka anyone ...? 
My face feels so cold- starting to think that if I touch it , it will fall off in one piece ... 
1 final down .. 3 and 1/2 to go . 
I remember when I was younger , I used to love snow ... now that I have to walk around and go places in it , not so much .. 
Been eating so many carrots today , I think I may turn orange . 
Two more exams and then I am done ! Yay . :) 
ODU ... you better not cancel exams tonight . I do NOT want to have to come back on Monday . 
Lovely ... my exams for tonight have been cancelled and moved to Monday . A little bit of snow and they freak out . 
Left side of mouth is numb and I feel like a drooling fool ... 
Wants to go on a trip ... car and/or train . I don't care where . 
Feeling like a chipmunk who talks like Jar-Jar Binks 
Finally finished with exams ... on way home soon . 
Mother , how I wish you would be civil and at least feign being nice for one day ... 
I don't like snow anymore ... 
Never been more ready for school to start again ... 
Busy day ... four classes . I think I'm actually going to enjoy them though . Have two classes a day for the rest of the week . Yay . 
Gym at 4 , light dinner then self defense at 7 . YAY .

So glad it's Friday ... one class at 11 then another at 1 and I'm done . YAY ! 
Black Swan ... wow . 
Just made a fantastic dinner ( yes Tara/Padre , < PROPFEMALE > CAN cook ! ;p ) .

Trying to come up with spring break plans ... 
With the exception of psych this morning , been at gym all day :) 
American History X then a Criminology paper ... fun . 
Wish we didn't have class today ... 
Okay , so question ... Are students really prepared to go on to a higher level of a particular subject if professors pick/choose what material will be covered ? 
Midterms already ? Semester is going by so fast ... 
Just found out her 20 < PROPFEMALE > paper for psych isn't due till April 29th ... YAY ! 
Finally got a haircut . :) 
Wishes people in her dorm would get their laundry out around the time that it's done so others could use the dryers .. 
One more exam then spring break for me . YAY ! 
Mexican places should deliver/do take out . 
ODU > VCU 
Might be going to an opera next week . :D 
Por favor , no clase mañana ... 
One more class ... oh history professor- why can't we just take the test and leave ? Nobody likes a lecture after a test . 
Okay , so I'm having issues today ... could someone please tell me how I can find/add a friend on here by e-mail ? 
Thinking about taking a math class over the summer ... Anyone at ODU know if summer classes are covered by financial aid ? 
6 weeks ! <3 
Signed up for housing ... just hope I remembered to pay the $250- I think I did ... 
Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s day all !
