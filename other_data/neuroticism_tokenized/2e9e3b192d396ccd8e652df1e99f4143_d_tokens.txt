President BARACK OBAMA was invited to address a < PROPMALE > gathering of the American Indian Nation two weeks ago in upstate New York . He spoke for almost an hour about his plans for increasing every Native American's present standard of living . He referred to his time as a U.S. Senator and how he had voted for every Native American issue that came to the floor of the Senate . 
READ THE TWO BELOW FIRST : The proud President then departed in his motorcade to a fundraiser , waving to the crowds . A news reporter later asked the group of chiefs how they came to select the new name they had given to the President . They explained that \Walking Eagle\ " is the name given to a bird so full of shit it can no longer fly . "
