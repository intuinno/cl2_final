Okay , I really like Daft Hands , I think everyone in my acquaintance knows this . So why did no one in the vast Internet think to inform me about Daft Bodies ? More intricate and also more hilarious . 

is having \thought-provoking thoughts\ " about CD transparency . " 
really sucks at staying in touch . Oops . 
70% < PROPMALE > I will be in NYC on Sunday , August 2nd ! I want to go to a book signing ! Who's with me ? =D 
IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT TORCHWOOD . OMGGGGGGG . 
is finally getting back into the otaku groove . Toradora ! is a great anime ! :DDD 
IS A VAMPIRE SQUID OF THE DEEP . 
broke a chair tonight . With her awesomeness . Actually , it was because I was sitting on it with someone else and it got fed up with us . Ker-plunk ! 
I am officially all applied to study abroad . All relevant documentation has been delivered into the hands of fate , University of Edinburgh , and the US Postal Service . \\o/ 
isn't working for the Mandroid . 
Oh , Black Friday . I still find it hilarious that my family takes you more seriously than Thanksgiving . This year was a really easy one for some reason . Totally smooth operation . 
When the cats are away , the mice ... will go duck hunting . 
just used the word \suckball\ " in a serious literary conversation . " 
' s whole brain got run over by the train . < PROPFEMALE > Barbaro 
All I want for Christmas is ... your love and all your lover's revenge . Would you like me to repeat it in French ? ;D 
Man , I was putting together a playlist of Christmas music to listen to with my parents when I got home and realized I'd only have like , two and a half legitimate days to listen to this stuff with them . Fuck you , Columbia . The baby Jesus is crying for you and your two sizes too small hearts . 
JAPAN , YOU SUCK AND I HATE YOUR FACE . NO LOVE , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I made it to Scotland . I am fine . Everything is fine . I love you all . Now I have to run off and do 5 billion things before classes start tomorrow . 
Ammendment to previous status . Yesterday , I learned that apparently descending airplanes = cars x1000 when it comes to my usually mild tendency toward motion sickness . Nothing gross , just extreme discomfort for about the last 80 minutes of the flight . Note to self : dramamine is your friend . 
Today , I heard Coldplay's Clocks played with bagpipes . My trip to Scotland is complete and the first week isn't even over yet ! 
Watashi no hobakurafuto wa unagi de ippai desu . This is what I learned instead of Welsh poetry today . http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/hovercraft.htm 
went to her first ceildh tonight ! It was amazing . I've never bumped into so many people in such a short span of time in my life , but it was so much fun ! 
Other things I did tonight : went to a Burns Supper , where I actually ate haggis ! And supper was followed by the ceilidh , making tonight a true Burns Night . It's like I've been officially assimilated into Scottish society . ( or something ) 
Back home safe and sound after weekend in Newcastle with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ! It was nice to have a girl's weekend . :) 
is having a crazy good time on her tour of the Highlands ! Totally feeling the DSL . <333 
has returned from her adventure across the Highlands . Only 2 causalities were incurred : I was wounded in the line of duty ( someone < PROPFIRST > blood during an epic game of Spoons at the hostel ) & my wellies've got a pretty epic crack in them now ( they are being retired with honors ) . My dignity , despite being sorely tried by traditional Highland clothing , remains intact . My DSL and my torch for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > will burn forever . 
I've been home for all of five minutes and I've apparently managed to upset people in New York , New Jersey , and < PROPFEMALE > . I get it , world ! My post-vacation buzz is thoroughly dead ! You can stop kicking it anytime ! 
I CANNAE MAKE MY PHOTOS UPLOAD . I think I might have gone over the album limit , but I don't actually know what the album limit is , and Facebook isn't telling me . Facebook has foiled all my dreams ! 
I have acquired PENGUIN BISCUITS . They're decent ! ( Not fabulous , but certainly not bad ! ) 
On the one hand , ugh , paper . On the other , yay , paper ! I've really missed the Victorian < PROPFEMALE > . I forgot how dreamy and yet grimy its writing can be . * hugs the topic lit < PROPFEMALE > ture and glares at the word document * 
If you've recently gotten an email from shibuya.yuuri@gmail.com inviting you to google calendar , that is me trying to give everybody a place to post traveling schedules . Totally up to you whether you post your plans there , but I figured it couldn't hurt . < PROPFEMALE > Messbauer < PROPFEMALE > Smith < PROPFEMALE > Stenhaug < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Parry < PROPFEMALE > Neumann 
Is anyone interested in hitting either the Museum of Scotland or the National Galleries tomorrow ? < PROPFIRST > Byler ? ... Bueller ? 
Also , is anyone interested in seeing a late afternoon or evening showing of I Love You < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > any time this week ? < PROPFIRST > Babitts 
MOOHAHAHA , PIERREFONDS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED . 
Easyjet is not being very nice to me at the very last minute . Ugh . 
The Icelandic volcano gods have stranded me in Rome with $300 as the starting price for getting off the continent in any way shape or form before Tuesday . What the hell . 
Is falling apart at the seams , but luckily all that is left to do at this point is wait and see and hopefully < PROPFEMALE > out in hostels and parks and airports and planes for the next two days . 
UK AIRSPACE HAS BEEN OPENED BY THE AVIATION BIGWIGS . WHERE ARE THE PARTY STREAMERS ? I can ( probably ) get back to the UK tomorrow ! \\o/ 
is BAAAAACK . Ahhh , I've never felt so happy to be cooped up in this smelly ghost town of a flat . 
Other than my class & presentation notes , I don't think I'm going to be able to study much more for this test . It's a weird battle against inability to concentrate & inability to face the mound of other kinds of studying I could have done if I'd had a few more days when I wasn't in Rome/in transit/in bed recovering from Rome/transit . Volcano !! ( Imagine me imitating Tennant's \Barrowman !! \ " voice and fist shake . ) " 
Hahaha , just got back from Iron Man 2 . Not quite the revelation of awesome that the first one was , but certainly still kind of insanely high on the awesome meter . Verdict : < PROPFIRST > Stark and his whirlwind of genius-level insanity continue to brighten my life . 
Went to the Beltane Fire Festival tonight . So many people painted so many colors ! So much fire ! So much public indecency ! It was definitely one of those cultural experiences you take away from study abroad to tell people back home . 
Back from the Cornwall trip ! It was AMAZING . Gretel Henderson was a great guide ! Anyone up for doing a 5 day tour of Wales with her from the 24th-28th ? It's a 5% discount if we register as a group of 4 . 
I'm officially coming home on June 15th ! < PROPFIRST > your calendars , lolol . 
I have two days to see as much of London as humanly possible . Right now it's looking like an insurmountable task . Recommendations for must see attractions on a budget ? Aaaand go ! 
Agghh , for some reason I spent all of today thinking that I was moving out tomorrow morning and not Friday morning . Soooo much expended effort that could have been spread out over a much more managable amount of time . 
Alright , world . Kluonie Frey , < PROPFEMALE > Casiello , < PROPFEMALE > Neumann , < PROPFEMALE > Barbaro , Elle < PROPFEMALE > , yesterday and today I watched all of Firefly . The show , the extras , the movie , the movie extras , and even one movie commentary . It was awesome . I'm sorry it took so long for me to break down and do this . 
I just did an hour's worth of dishes b/c someone in my flat is apparently morally opposed to cleaning & left all sorts of stuff for me to find in the kitchen . Now I have 3 flats worth of clean dishes & a chunk of my deposit waiting to disappear if I don't dispose of any personal belongings . < PROPFEMALE > Parry , do you think you left anything in the kitchen ? Any idea what came with the dorm ? I'm at a loss . 
Back in the US . The internet's been sketchy & I've been hanging out with my parents a lot , so I've been incommunicado with the larger world , but I really am back ! I have to admit I didn't really miss < PROPFEMALE>'s humidity levels , but it was nice that the first thing I did when I was back in New Jersey was go to a drug store at 9:30 PM to restock on essential < PROPFEMALE > n toiletries . A store was open at 9:30 !! I love < PROPFEMALE > . 
I HAS A PHONE . I want to text everybody just to remind myself how it works again , hahaha . 
OHOHO , I FINALLY FINISHED GOING THROUGH MY PHOTOS FROM ABROAD . Expect albums to start cropping up later in the day . GET READY TO SEE SOME CULTURALLY SIGNIFICANT LANDMARKS PHOTOGRAPHED FROM HIPSTER ANGLES ~~~ 
Oh , AWESOME . My gmail account was hacked this morning . It looks like Google caught it pretty fast , but if you got any suspicious emails from me today , even from my Barnard account , delete and disregard . 
Somebody strolled into our house today while I was still asleep and my Dad was in the garden and walked out with one of my parents ' cameras and my purse . My wallet with my debit card and IDs , my iPod , and all my chargers were in there , plus a bunch of keepsakes from Scotland and Wales , and my favorite jacket . I'm horrified . I can't even comprehend my life right now . Most unlucky summer ever . 
Just finished a short paper on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s Ten Things I Love About You for my Senior Seminar on romance . LOLOL The cons of having to write a paper less than a week after uni starts are nearly outweighed by the coolness of having written it on my favorite romance novelist . 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is credited in the deatthly hallows as the parseltongue specialist . YOU CAN'T TELL ME WIZARDS AREN'T REAL NOW . 
\This movie is a work of fiction . \ " NOT ACCORDING TO DR . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE >."
