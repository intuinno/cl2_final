just booked his and < PROPFEMALE>'s honeymoon . Vegas , baby ! 

Construction starts on the new house today . < PROPFEMALE > and I will show up with a couple lawn chairs and a 30-pack . 
Why would the Cavs draft a project when they only have a one-year window ? 
Okay , that's it ..... I will be summarily rejecting all ' hearts ' effective immediately . 
Wearing a jacket in July ..... only in < PROPMALE > . 
Okay , the amount of stress is now reaching the ridiculous level . I gotta say though , I'm still pretty calm .... 
Getting ready to check progress on the house and then throw some cornhole at Lagerhead's .... 
Only 9 more days until < PROPFEMALE > and I become residents of York Township . We're looking forward to attending our first hootenanny ! 
Tomorrow begins the busiest month of our lives ..... looking forward to it ! 
Proud citizen of York Township . 
Farmville is down right now .... fail . 
Just threw out my back .... not good . 
It's ridicurous ..... a design fail in the game . I'm hoping that they eventually add an enhancement which allows for a tank for each machine . In the meantime , it's still worth having the machines ..... I just stagger the timing of my fields . 
Didn't mean to post that as my status . Why don't they let you delete your own posts ? 
@Karalyn seems to have fixed up my back ..... but then I went and split open my pinky toe on the corner of the bed . Just hoping to be able to walk at the wedding .... lol 
I'm getting married today . How's that for a status update ? 
Mah-wedge .... Mah-wedge is what bwung us togethuh Saturday . Mah-wedge , that bwessed awaingement . That dweam .... within a dweam .... 
In < PROPFIRST > for today and most of tomorrow . Since there wasn't going to be an Indian summer up in < PROPMALE > , at least I'm able to experience it this way . 
Arrived at work this morning at 4:45 ..... won't be leaving until about 4:30 this afternoon ..... good times . 
Today is insanity . Trying to get an earlier flight home ..... 
USC gets lucky again against Notre Dame . I hate USC ..... even more than Florida . 
Whatever happened to < PROPFEMALE > Pepsi ? 
TO MY FARMVILLE FRIENDS : < PROPMALE > Vandelay is my dummy profile , so feel free to accept him . You'll get a free Farmville neighbor out of it . 
If you don't like the new Facebook format ( who does ? ) , here is how you can change it back to the old way . Look to the top left menu and click on MORE . Then drag STATUS UPDATES to the top . After dragging to top , click on it . That becomes your default , which will set everything up like it was before . 
The Cavs just gave away a 14-point lead . Go Tribe . 
My second Christmas is coming up this weekend . Sunday will be National Sleep Day , where we \fall back\ " an hour to honor my favorite hobby -- sleeping . Good times ahead ! " 
The extra hour of sleep was awesome ! I only wish I was awake to enjoy it . 
Did Issue 3 pass ? Amazingly , I can't find the results online .... 
Happy Veterans Day . It's great to give appreciation to our nation's veterans for everything they've done ..... in fact , it seems like a big enough occasion to have a day off of work , doesn't it ? Too bad our employers don't seem to think so . Commies .... 
Farmville friends : Please send me chickens ! 
Can't get into Farmville ..... is it just me ? 
The Steelers fell victim to ' the process'! 
Finished all my shopping today . Gotta love the Giant Eagle gift card stand .... 
I am SO sick of the phrase \at the end of the day \"." 
Happy Birthday to our Lord ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all .... 
Lakers = PUNISHED 
Thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes !!! 
I am strongly considering quitting Farmville ..... I just don't know if I'm strong enough to do it yet . 
Looks like Mo < PROPMALE > is quitting on the team tonight . This game went from a probable win to an automatic loss . 
Go Cavs ! I never doubted them .... 
Somehow I just lost about 2/3 of my music off my iPod . It wanted me to \sync\ " it or something ..... what a mistake that was . Apple FAIL . " 
Going to Chicago this week ..... I'll be sure to spit on the statue of < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > while I'm there . 
Back from Chicago ..... driving through downtown there is insanity . 
I have planted my final crops in Farvmille . I ran out of fuel and I'm sick of clicking . It takes a half hour to turn over my farm ..... that's unacceptable . In two days I'll have my broccoli sign and then it'll be time to < PROPFEMALE > up the boots . 
Getting pumped for Cavs vs Magic tonight ! 
That was the worst dunk contest ever . 
Reportedly the Cavs have offered Z and Hickson for Stoudemire .......... I'm for it . 
Cavs get < PROPMALE > ! What a ridiculously lopsided deal too . Getting ready to buy my ticket for the parade in June .... 
The Cavs are DONE . That was an embarrassing and shameful \performance \"." 
Sorry about all the \who is stalking your profile\ " notices ..... I don't even know what it is . " 
Went to bed at 2:00 last night , got up at 6:30 this morning ..... preparing for when Zach arrives . 
Today has been one of the most frustrating days of my life ..... and 90% of the frustration is due to snow . Why do all of us live here ? Seriously , I wonder why people ever settled in this part of the country . 
< PROPFEMALE > is measuring at 37 weeks ..... good times ahead . 
It's nice to actually be able to open your windows ..... 
< PROPFEMALE > is now measuring at 40 weeks ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is also a bit under the weather this morning . And even I have the sniffles . I think it's the changing weather .... 
Lived the \American Dream\ " today ..... brought the grill out and cooked some burgers while enjoying a brewskie and a cigar . Good times .... " 
Got a new job today ( same company ) and will have a new son in a couple days . Other than that , not much going on ..... 
5:45 am ..... about to start one of the biggest days of our lives ! 
BORN ! < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Hill , March 26th at 4:17 am . 7 lbs , 12 oz , 22 inches long . Mother and baby are doing fine ! Thanks to everyone for the congratulatory wishes ..... we don't have internet access at the hospital so we'll make pics available once we get home . 
My kid sleeps like a < PROPMALE > Hill during the day . I don't know what he has against sleeping at night though .... 
The wife and son let me sleep 7 hours today ! Life is good .... 
Happy Easter , everyone ! 
I'm currently on solo parenting duty while < PROPFEMALE > takes a much-needed and much-deserved nap . Got him in the poop chair watching Sunrise Earth ..... this is Father-of-the-Year material right here , folks . 
Likely to be up until about 3:00 or 4:00 tonight , depending on Zach's schedule . I should find something productive to do ( maybe write ? ) ..... let's hope laziness doesn't set in and I doze off .... 
Last night around 9:00 Zach set a new world record ( verified by Guiness ) for longest stretch of time screaming at the top of one's lungs . But once he settled down he actually slept pretty well last night . Good times .... 
Wow .... got so tired that I literally almost nodded off at my desk . Had to walk around the building to get the juices flowing again . And to think that < PROPFEMALE > is getting even less sleep than I am .... 
< PROPMALE > Brasky is currently the President of 12 different countries . That number would have been 13 , but he ate one of them after winning the election . 
Today was Earth Day ? Huh .... just found out . Then again , I'm a Republican , so I'm not supposed to care about the environment .... ;) 
My son is one month old today ! If anyone wants to give him any gifts , he likes iTunes gift cards and Cavs-related gear , size XXL . 
Trying not to fall asleep at my desk . Just another month or two to go until normalcy starts to be restored ..... 
Looks like we're finally getting a lawn ! Work is scheduled to start tomorrow . Adios to the mud pit .... 
You ever get the feeling that you had a haircut but you didn't have one ? I'm all itchy back here .... 
Getting violently ill is never fun . But it helps when you have a wife like < PROPFEMALE > who can handle taking care of TWO kids . 
< PROPFIRST > Price is a traitor . He personally works with Rajon Rondo so that he can end the Cavs season . He's also the current shooting coach for the Atlanta Hawks , which basically makes him a traitor to two teams . He just went from being my favorite player of all time to being on a list that includes < PROPFIRST > Boozer and < PROPMALE > Modell . 
LeBron , please leave . It will be good riddance . You're not a winner ; you never have been . You've been anointed a ' < PROPMALE>' yet you haven't conquered anything . Go to New York and see how your act plays out there . 
has turned into a claims-settling machine ! 
Prediction for tonight : Celtics 108 , Cavs 83 . < PROPFIRST > Brown gets fired by the weekend . LeBron signs with either Miami or Chicago . Shaq is not resigned , Z retires , West ends up either in prison or the nuthouse . Within three years < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > moves the team to Las Vegas . 
Hey < PROPMALE > Modell , can you take the Cavs away too ? 
I saw ' The Hangover ' for the first time over the weekend . Two thumbs up ! 
7 1/2 hours of UNINTERRUPTED sleep ! < PROPFEMALE > is a shining light sent down from Heaven . :) 
Why is the local media completely ignoring the Delonte West - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > story ? 
\I know how to spell Lincoln ! \"" 
My take on parenting : Being a parent is like playing a really tough golf course . There's water everywhere , sand traps , hills , trees ..... you're not scoring very well . But even though it's really hard , it's great to be out there . You're still having fun . Not being a parent is like playing putt putt . There is no pressure and nobody really cares how well anyone is playing . 
\Hey Harold ..... you don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor . \"" 
Zach has gone between 8 and 9 hours the last three nights between feedings ! Is normalcy around the corner already ? 
Thanks to all those who have served the greatest country in the history of the world , the United States of < PROPFEMALE > . And thanks to those who are still serving and fighting against the evils of Islamic extremism , both at home and abroad . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I spent this afternoon doing yard work . Now we no longer have the worst yard on the street ! 
\Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out . ” \ 
The entire Hill family is sleeping right now . < PROPFEMALE > , Zach , the dog , the cats . The house is very peaceful right now . 
\That's a pretty girl over there . I wonder if she goes out with one of the Yankees . \"" 
enjoyed his first \actual\ " Father's Day yesterday . " 
December 10 , 2009 . Browns 13 , Steelers 6 . It still makes me smile just thinking about it . 
\It's a Tubman 601 . I flew one in ' Little Neddy Goes to War ' . \"" 
Embarrassing performance by the Americans . Since they decided to crap out , I'll have to pick a new team . Go England ! 
Okay , England is out ..... go Netherlands ! 
Well I tried to use a hand tool today and ended up breaking a shower head . Fail . 
< PROPFIRST > Bosh is a scum bag . Worst of luck to ya in Miami , < PROPFIRST > ..... worst of luck to ya . 
ESPN has reported that LeBron will sign with the Miami Heat . \ 
It's bad enough to leave .... but to do it on national TV and embarrass your own hometown ..... it just goes to show that this guy only cares about himself , and himself only . I'm actually looking forward to hating him . 
LeBron < PROPFIRST > is a narcissistic sociopath . He represents all that is soulless and wrong . 
My kid rarely sleeps past 8 in the morning . Today , with a bunch of contractors here drilling and banging things around , he is sleeping more soundly than I ever have . I went into his room to check on him and he was laying there with his eyes closed , smiling . He's crazy ! 
So an activist judge blocked parts of the Arizona immigration law today . Apparently it's no longer illegal to be illegal , but it IS illegal to enforce immigration laws . 
Ya know , it's so nice when it happens good .... 
Am I the only person who doesn't know what \Kings of Leon\ " is ? " 
I rarely post quotes , but I couldn't pass the < PROPMALE > to forward this one on :\ 
' In the midst of pain , never forget that God does not share your doubts about yourself . ' - < PROPFIRST > Brown 
Just finished golfing in 90+ degree heat . Good times .... 
My kid is insane . He's sitting here yelping and screaming in excitement while watching Dinosaur Train . He's actually starting to sound like a dinosaur .... 
You know your world has changed when songs from Sesame Street and Dinosaur Train get stuck in your head on a daily basis . 
Zach has been very excitable today . Lots of screaming , smiling , laughing . Insanity . 
< PROPFIRST > Kolb has officially been inducted into the Brittle Fantasy Hall of Shame . He contributed -2 points to my team on Sunday . My team then lost by 2 points . Congratulations , < PROPFIRST > . You've joined a presitgious group of epic failers that includes < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Mass , Marques Colston , and < PROPFIRST > Conway . 
How can < PROPFIRST > Collie have 12 catches while < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > only has four ? Are we in the bizarro world or something ? 
By the way , Inception is a ridiculously-good movie . Finally got to see it tonight . 
What the heck happened to Vick ? It better not be serious .... 
Bought a new lawn mower today . Good times .... 
< PROPMALE > Tressel's refusal to run up the store may be admirable , but it also may end up costing his team a < PROPMALE > to play in the national championship game . 
Zach is making noises that are similar to the little piggy shrieking \weeeeee !!!!!! \ " in that Geico commercial . And my reaction is similar to that of the woman driving the car . " 
99.9% of the time I don't do forwards or repost requests . But I felt this one was worth an exception . \ 
I believe in Jesus Christ . As one of my fb friends did , I \ 
challenge all believers to post this on their wall ... In the Bible it \ 
says \If you deny me in front of your peers 
Wisconsin up 14-0 . I hate the Buckeyes .... 
I need 34 points from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > tonight . Stranger things have happened .... 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > doesn't sleep . He waits . 
I hate fantasy football . Why can't I stop playing it ? 
LeBron's record is now 0-1 . Eat that , traitor . I wonder how the waitresses are liking his 2% tips down there in South Beach .... 
< PROPMALE > Brasky is a ten-foot tall beast man who showers in vodka and feeds his baby shrimp scampi . 
Had a very nice Halloween in the new neighborhood . Good times .... 
Didn't vote today .... couldn't get out of bed in time . Why do they do this on a Tuesday every year anyway ? Whose idea was that ? Why not do it on a weekend when 90% of people are off ? Oh well .... my guys ( Kasich , Portman , Renacci ) are all gonna win anyway . 
Four receivers , gotta bench one ..... who do you sit ? Hakeem Nicks , < PROPFEMALE > Moss , < PROPFIRST > Fitzgerald , < PROPFIRST > Moss .... 
Having a great week of vacation . Took the first couple days to decompress ..... then the last couple to get some stuff done around the house . Most of all , enjoying the good times with the wife and son ! 
Random rant : So I go to the bank to deposit the $5 million dollars we have in change .... took forever to count and roll it . I lug it all to the door and then see that the bank is closed . Nothing at all against Veteran's Day , but why are banks closed on it when everything else is open ? When are these banks going to move past this outdated brand of thinking and see that we now live in a 24x7 business environment ? 
It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a Browns game as much as today's . The outcome was disappointing , but what a great game ..... I hate < PROPFIRST > Sanchez and LaDainian Tomlinson though . Oh , and Chansi Stuckey . Just go out of bounds and we win the game .... 
DirecTV is the devil . I have a higher opinion of LeBron < PROPFIRST > than I do of DirecTV . Worst customer service ever . Worst DVRs ever . Worst provider of anything ever ..... ever . 
We are finally out from under the dark cloud known as DirecTV ! I wish that company the absolute worst . 
Only in < PROPMALE > can another team give you the ball six extra times and you still find a way to lose . 
Armstrong cable being installed today . I can't believe we made it a week and a half without TV ! 
A special ' Happy Thanksgiving ' to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Pettigrew . May you continue to rack up points while I rack up pounds eating turkey today . 
Uh oh .... I think I may have found a game on Facebook that might take over my life , like Farmville did last year ..... it's ESPN U's College Campus game . Someone please help me , before it's too late .... 
Gave up on the Cavs about halfway through the 3rd quarter . A downright shameful performance . 
Just realized we have the NFL RedZone channel . This is better than the Sunday ticket . Kiss it , DirecTV . 
I'm so sick of this crap . The snow might as well be feces flying through the air ..... that's about all it's worth . Gotta shovel the driveway for the second time in the last 16 hours . I swear we're retiring in Florida . Why did so many people settle here to begin with ??? 
< PROPFIRST > Turner and < PROPMALE > McFadden are pure scum . 
Haven't had the time to get the snowblower fixed , so looks like I'll be shoveling for the 5th time already this year . 
Biggest game of my fantasy football career today . Vick , < PROPMALE > , both CJs , McCoy , Charles ..... be sure to bring your A-games . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > tmas to < PROPFIRST > Vick , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , LeSean McCoy , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Pettigrew , < PROPMALE > Rackers , and the Chicago Bears defense . May you all experience statistical joy and personal < PROPFEMALE > this blessed weekend . Remember , there is no \team\ " in \ " I \"." 
< PROPFIRST > Witten ruined my Christmas last night . 
Tonight , < PROPFIRST > Vick and LeSean McCoy have the opportunity to erase 11 years of fantasy football misery and heartache . The ghosts of < PROPFIRST > Aikman , < PROPFEMALE > Moss , < PROPFIRST > Green -- even the haunting specter of < PROPFIRST > Conway -- can all be exorcised . ( Someone cue the < PROPMALE > theme song now .... ) 
Wow was that game unnecessarily close . I think I ate an entire bottle of Tums . After 11 years , I figured I'd be jumping up and down like a mad fool , but I really just feel relief more than anything else . Congrats to Karnak on a great season and thanks to Steve-O for being Commish ! 
Sorry to anyone who received a video link from me on here . There's some stupid kinda virus thing going around apparently . 
I appreciate all the birthday wishes . Getting violently ill on your birthday is never fun , but it was actually still a great day . 
The Steelers are the luckiest franchise in pro sports . 
I can't get the theme song from \Timmy Time\ " out of my head . Sad .... " 
I get to work from home today . Eat that , snow . 
I know it's bad out now , but winter is actually almost over . I mean , we're already through January . And February is the shortest month of the year . March is only 4 weeks away , and then it's like a 50/50 split between good and bad weather . Weekdays always go by fast ..... and when you subtract out meals , showers , and time sleeping , it's like ten minutes really . It's like a cup of coffee . 
Whatever happened to 10-10-220 ? 
$540 to repair a wheel on a car that's worth about $ 2,000 ..... good times . 
Go Cavs ! Keep on losing .... more < PROPFEMALE > pong balls in the hopper for the draft lottery . The Wizards game coming up soon worries me though ..... they might blow it and win that one . 
This place has severely ticked me off . 
The Slam Dunk Contest is officially now the dumbest thing ever . 
Had to let the boy cry himself to sleep for the first time last night . He was insane .... seemed to sleep pretty well once he finally drifted off though . 
All I have time for is work , sleep , and taking care of Zach . And there isn't even enough time for all those things . 
Anyone know what to do about a sump pump that won't turn off ? And keep in mind that you'll be answering a question asked by a guy who barely knows how to use basic hand tools . 
For Fat Tuesday , I think I'm just gonna stay at home and try to get fatter . 
Am I the only one who doesn't care about the Tressel thing ? I mean , I still don't know what the big deal was about the players selling stuff anyway . College athletes should get paid anyway .... it's a dumb rule to begin with . People are acting like Tressell and the players shattered the Ten Commandments or something . 
My final four : Ohio State , Texas , Kansas , Pitt . I got Kansas over Texas in the title game . My heart says the Bucks , but my mind says the Jayhawks . 
Utah State ruined my bracket . A 30-4 team playing practically in their backyard .... sigh . 
I am officially on vacation ! Whew .... 
My kid turned 1 yesterday . In some ways , I can't believe it's already been a year . In other ways , it feels like I lived 10 years over the course of the past 12 months . 
The Buckeyes proved themselves to be frauds on Friday night . Even worse , they proved < PROPFIRST > Barkley and < PROPMALE > Smith to be right .... sigh . 
It's official .... I have thrown out my back yet again . 
Random thought regarding the NCAA Tournament ..... don't any of these kids have to go to class ? I mean , if you're on a team that goes all the way to the Final Four , that's four weeks of travelling across the country . 
I hate the Indians .
