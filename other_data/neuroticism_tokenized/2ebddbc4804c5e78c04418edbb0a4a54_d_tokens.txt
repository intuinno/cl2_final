A stallion at the farm hit his eye really bad , so they might have to amputate , but either way , he'll be blind . It's so sad :( 
Going out to the island today :) Horses all day on my birthday on Monday :) 
Finally 15 . Had a very lovely birthday :) Couldn't imagine a better way to spend it . 
Got back from the horse clinic after two days . It was much fun :) 
Munching on tuna crackers . Only I couldn't find the mayonnaise and instead used the Miracle Whip , so it doesn't taste as good as it should . Whatever . 
Just got back from a successful morning of horse riding . Cocoa was a very good girl . 
HATE my new hair with a passion . 
ugh . taking a break from cleaning :\\ 
Groomed horsies this evening - best way to spend it :) 
I couldn't have been outside for more than 5 minutes about a half an hour ago and I'm still recovering from the numbness . FREEZING . 
It's an early release today :) 
My thighs are so stiff and sore from yesterday :) But so worth it . 
New semester :) 
Think I wanna dye my hair . It's so boring ! Ugh . And I wanna redo my wardrobe , geez . I think it should be school shopping time again (: Haha . 
Oh my god , the miniature horsie finally came and I got to see it yesterday (: 32 inches and it DRAGGED me :) I have such horrible luck with small horses/ponies ... but I just can't keep away (: Anyway , the cutest thing I've seen in my entire life . Like ... Oh my god . 
< PROPMALE > , you're the most adorable baby that hospital has ever seen :) Your just a doll ! Oh my God , that was so sweet :) < PROPFEMALE > loves him so much , already such an awesome big sister . Good job < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > on another gorgeous baby ! 
I absolutely cannot bring myself to read any more of Frankenstein . It uses big words and blabs on and on about crap I don't care about . The guy's such a sap . I have five quotes for him , but no luck with the monster . Stupid book . 
Staying home sick . Ugh . I sneezed all over my cat earlier this morning ... Scared her . 
Ugh ! Feel like craaaaap . Have to go to school tomorrow though , things need to get done . Ew . 
Horsies this morning :) Then clean , clean clean . Ugh . 
< PROPFEMALE > is over :) It's been a productive day ! Had ice cream , went to the grocery store , flew a kite ... Fun fun fun ! Now I guess I should get started on my homework . Grrrr =P 
Yay ! Today will be awesome :) Mani-Pedi this morning ( that should be interesting , LOL ) , then < PROPMALE>'s soccer game , then probably shopping and a new cell phone . Can't wait ! 
Hope I did okay on my < PROPMALE > test yesterday :/ 
I hate the new youtube . It's stupid . 
Watching \The Hunchback of Notre Dame\ " . Best Disney movie ever to be made aside from \ " The Lion King \"." 
Happy Easter (: 
Watching the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood . One of my favorite movies . < PROPFEMALE > Bullock's such an amazing actress (: 
Cocoa was perfect today (: I was a little worried because when I first got the saddle on she started throwing a hissy fit , but she was awesome after she got over that . I feel so accomplished (: 
Made THE best peanut butter cookies this morning . Horseback riding and then I'm making banana bread ! Hehe . I feel like a grandma (: 
Just a good day today (: Love it . Cocoa was awesome once again , and I got to cuddle with < PROPFIRST > . Took a nap (: So refreshed ! 
Is there ever a bad day with the horses ? Pouring and chilly , but it was nice just grooming everyone (: Unfortunately , I think I'm coming down with something and I have an essay due on Wednesday . Back to reality ! 
I . Feel . Like . CRAP . Will this ever go away ? I don't think I've ever been sick for more than two days and this doesn't feel like it's gonna fade off any time soon . My throat's so raw ... and I'm all out of popsicles . Finishing up my stupid essay . I'm so insanely tired . I wouldn't be surprised if I got a failing grade on it , I doubt it's making much sense at all . Ugh . I'm gonna have so much homework . 
Five tips for a woman ; 1 . It is important to find a man that helps you around the house and has a job . 2 . It is important to find a man that makes you laugh . 3 . It is important to find a man you can count on and doesn't lie to you . 4 . It is important to find a man that loves you and spoils you . 5 . It is important ... that these four men don't know each other ... 
Made my Momma banana crumb muffins this morning , picked up the house , did the dishes and gave her a back massage . Homework , drop off < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday surprise , then it sounds like we're going somewhere . Should be a busy , but fun Mother's Day (: Happy Mother's Day to all you awesome Mommy's . Don't know what I'd do without mine . 
That didn't even feel like a weekend , and now I have to go to school ? I want a refund . 
My goodness ! Come home and my < PROPFEMALE > is adament about soaking my arm with love slobber (: I love my Boozlebear . 
I am SO done with being sick . My nose is stuffy , I cough every five seconds , I'm running a fever , feel like I might faint , I'm so sore everywhere ... it's ridiculous . All freaking week .

Supposed to get up to 75 degrees later today ! So excited (: I'm totally from Washington ... 
My poor baby Booboobear . Just got back from the vet - Basically he's been peeing all over the house and acting super depressed , so we got him checked out . He was terrified in the cage for the car ride , then he got a needle stuck up through his tummy all the way into his bladder at the doctors , then we took him out of his cage for the car ride home - which worked out fairly well . Anywho , I think he needs a nap . 
Hope everyone had a fun fourth (: I sure did . Oh , yes ... and does anyone else agree that there was thunder and lightning last night ? I swear there was . 
heading to get my spray tan ... scary ! but wearing shorts right now , i feel like i'm gonna blind someone ...

Lots of things on my to-do list , lots of things on my mind ... Just need to take things one step at a time , work hard , be wise , and hope for the best .

After watching several episodes of Looney Toons , I've realized that my mom is a Do-Do Bird ( because she goes WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ) and Boo is Pepe < PROPFEMALE > Pew (' cause he runs JUST like that ) ... 
I . Hate . School . 
Found a stray tabby kitten in the Walmart parking lot just a bit ago and he's with us for the night . Doesn't look like he's neutered and I gave him a big bowl of food and water about 15 minutes ago - and he's just about done with it . So I think we made the right decision by bringing him home =) Such a sweetie too . Taking him to the alternative humane society tomorrow . 
Just wanted to notify you mom , you SUCK at washing dishes - I'm so annoyed with finding yuck residue on the bottoms of my cups , so I'd appreciate it if you paid more attention WHILST cleaning the dishes , please ... However , you are the most fearless giant spider killer ever , so I worship you . Just ... lettin ' ya know . 
Depressededed . Should go out to Sonics and get a burger ... because that makes all the problems go away . 
Me : Where is it ? \ 
Mom : Third Drawer Down . \ 
Me : ... that should be a band name . 
Well < PROPFEMALE > ( the Quarter Horse mare I had ridden for a few weeks ) finally sold =( But I have a new project now ! A three-year-old Friesian filly named < PROPFEMALE > . Perfect , easy height and such a sweetheart . & hearts ; 
Jeeeez ... this week is packed . I don't know whether I want it to go by faster or slower , ha . I could definately use some more time , but I wouldn't mind getting it all done with either =/ 
Making nummy treats tonight , then study stuff I don't know how to do , fail a Chemistry test tomorrow , then go ride my new horsie project after school =) At least the good and the bad are balanced , ha . 
Had an amazing ride on this week's horsie project , < PROPFEMALE > . Such a doll ; three-year-old 15hh Friesian filly just started . So pretty , so gentle , gaits are so easy to ride out and she's such a quick learner ! Can't wait to see her again in the Spring =) 
oh my goodness . < PROPFIRST > in the box pumpkin pie milkshake :) 
Mom : \If you really love me 
Six period days SUCK . 
FINALLY get my hair trimmed again tomorrow . Nothing < PROPMALE > ; just fix up the bangs and re-layer ... but seriously , it's been like 4 months ... 
Started off my day by falling into a ditch and it ends just as odd =) 
If you know a horse who has made you laugh , brightened your life , silently\ 
accepted your tears without judgment , snuggled with you , forgiven your \ 
faults and loved you anyway , make this your status . Horses are a gift \ 
most of us don't deserve . Repost if you can relate . 
Oh , jeez . I'm so tired and I haven't even begun my homework . I should get on that ... 
Halloween is TOMORROW =D 
On the island , staying at my grandparent's house for the weekend =) Woot ! The end of a good ( though busy ) week and start of a good weekend ! 
Eh , totally underestimated the amount of homework I had this weekend . Uh Oh . 
Leaving early from school today =D Chyessssss . 
So many tests today ; but then no school tomorrow =D Yay ! 
Weekend ! Oh thank goodness you're finally here =D Never abandon me like that again =/ 
Baked Apple Pie Yogurt ?! I never knew they made such a wonderful thing =D Gonna be a good Sunday night ... bake some peanut butter cookies ( thank you , Sparklle ) and watch some 21 Jumpstreet ( thank you Youtube and < PROPFIRST > Depp ;) 
Soooo according to the Weather Channel , it should be snowing within the next 36 hours ! So Boogie-Bear-Kitty ... it's been two days and you need to come home =( 
I may not be the most beautiful or sexy girl , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be everyones first choice , but I am a great choice . I do not pretend to be someone I am not , because I am good at being me . I may not be proud of some things in my PAST , but I am proud of who I am TODAY . Take me as I am or watch me walk away ! POST if you're proud of being you ! 
My < PROPFEMALE > came home last night , thank god ! I can be whole again =D Haha . But he's ridiculously skinny and has a broken leg , so we're taking him to the vet today . Oh , I'm just so glad he's home =) 
I'm so blind , UGH . 
Better a < PROPFEMALE > with a flaw than a pebble without one . 
Cleaning , then dinner , then homework =] Simple night . 
Happy birthday , Momma !!! =D I love you <3 
Ooooh no ... Chemistry test tomorrow =[ 
Got my hair cut - quite a bit shorter ( a few inches off) ! But a ton more layers , and I actually kinda like it , ha =] Weird . 
Oh , I'm sooooooooo ready for break =] 
I love Christmas =] Hope everyone has a great one ! 
Abercrombie sweats , fuzzy socks and hot cocoa with whip cream - I know how to handle cold days ;] Really hoping for a snow day tomorrow ! 
Helping to rehome two guinea pigs for a friend - the female is a long haired grey and the male is a dark brown and white smooth coat . They come with cages and just need loving homes ! Comment or message me if you're interested =] 
Busy , busy todayyyy =] But first , horsies . <3 
Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else ; you are the one getting burned . 
\I want a big white house with a blue pool ... with no germs or spiders . \ " - My germaphobic brother . " 
FINALLY ! Friday , and I can just relax . This week seemed to drag on and on and on and on and on ... 
Dying my hairrrrr =] we'll see how it turns out ! 
My poor Boo ; got him a harness and took him outside , but he was just so scared - shaky , overly aware , etc . It's really sad that some people are that effed up in the head and insecure to hurt a defenseless animal so bad that they're afraid of everything . On a much higher note , so excited for Zempa to have her foal ! She's been such a sweet preggy too , ha =]
