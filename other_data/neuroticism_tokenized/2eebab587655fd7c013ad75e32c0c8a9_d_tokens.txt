There is no universal moral code that should dictate human behavior . There is no such thing as good or evil , there is no universal standard of right and wrong . Our values and morals come from us and belong to us , whether we like it or not ; so we should claim them proudly for ourselves , as our own creations , rather than seeking some external justification for them . 
there were chemtrails over covington today , if you dont know what that is , you should probably look it up ...
