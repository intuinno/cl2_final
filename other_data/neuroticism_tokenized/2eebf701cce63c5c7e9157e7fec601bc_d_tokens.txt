Just now , just here and now .... Half the bottom of my shoe fell off . The half that isn't there . I can't describe , I can explain . Half the bottom of my shoe fell off ... I put it back , where it goes , I hold it there with tape . Half the bottom of my shoe is back on , the half that wasn't there . 

I cannot feed my fish !
