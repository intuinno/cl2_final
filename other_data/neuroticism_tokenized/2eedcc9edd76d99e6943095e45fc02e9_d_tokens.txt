Explanation of the name < PROPFEMALE > from UrbanDictionary.com: A person who is loving and caring . Loyal to everyone important in her life and is easy to forgive , but won't let someone walk all over her . She steals the heart of everyone she dates , because she is real . Very few girls often like this person , because they feel threatened or intimidated by her .

i would love to < PROPFEMALE > out with a transformer 
Coconuts here we come ! 
sometimes things just don't turn out the way you expect them to . know that you are where you are supposed to be in your life , there is a reason for it . only you can hold yourself back . 
My poor dog Bubba is sick . He has a fever and an ear infection . Good thing I took him to the vet earlier . Now I am broke again but he's worth it . 
too much on my mind to display on here 
Man , some people REALLY piss me off . Selfish , uncaring and disrespectful , I could go on and on . What happened to the < PROPFEMALE > Rule ? 
Wishing I had the energy ( and money ) to go do something this weekend ... 
Man , I'm bored . I would drink some beer but am on antibiotics for the next 19 days . This sucks . 
Ahhh , finally some \relaxation \"..........." 
Anyone going to the port tonight ? I'm thinking I just may ...

Praying that < PROPFEMALE > can get better . We go to the vet today . Poor babygirl . 
RIP < PROPFEMALE > 3.13.01 - 12.13.10 
Have a funky Christmas Everyone ! 
I can't believe that Mom and < PROPMALE > are still sleeping . I am always the first one up dangit ! I used to go wake Steph up and she would get up with me , then Mom would hear us out in the living room and come out , make coffee , and sit in her fluffy robe . We were spoiled rotten ! I still am . \ 
I am going to make the coffee this year and wake them up ! 
Sick Sick Sick Sick , cough cough cough and then .... cough some more . ugh . that's all i'm gonna say about that .

For the first time ever I have laryngitis and the worst cold ever ... The worst part is I can't SPEAK ! And when I do talk , I have to yell and only a soft whisper comes out . I'm gonna have to start walking around with a tablet of paper and a pen ... \ 
I'm pretty sure everyone else in the house is happy I can't talk too , that's fuddup . 
So , my Momma is in the hospital , recovering from a bowel obstruction of 16cm , nearly died . Thank GOD she finally asked me for help . She never asks and my < PROPFEMALE > ball is broken ... 
I really wish my bf's baby momma wasn't so weird toward me . She hates me and doesn't even know me . How can people be like that ? I do not understand .

A real woman always keeps her house clean and organized , the laundry basket is always empty . She's always well dressed , hair done . She never swears and behaves gracefully in all situations and under all circumstances . She has more than enough < PROPFEMALE > to take care of her family , always has a smile on her lips , and a kind word for everyone . Post this as your status if you , too , suspect that you might be a man . 
Osama used one of his wives as a shield in the firefight . What a piece of shit . 
Today is SOOOO much better than yesterday . Man , I feel fabulous :)

Did you know that those who appear to be really Strong .. really are the most sensitive ? Did you know that those who spend all their time protecting others ... sometimes really need someone to protect them ? Did you know that three of the hardest things to say are : I love you , I'm Sorry & Help me .. 
Women's Ass Size Study : There is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses , the results were pretty interesting . 30% of women think their ass is too fat , 10% of women think their ass is too skinny , the remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he is a good man , and wouldn't trade him for the world ...

It has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges .

I might not be someone's first choice , but I am a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm good at being me . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past , but I am proud of who I am today . I may not be perfect .... but I don't need to be . Take me as I am , or watch me as I walk away !!! Post this if you're proud of being you :) 
5 DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN ~ \ 
1 . FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when she knows she is RIGHT & YOU need to SHUT UP . \ 
2 . NOTHING : Means SOMETHING & you need to be WORRIED . \ 
3 . GO AHEAD : This is a dare , not permission , do NOT do it . \ 
4 . WHATEVER : A woman's way of saying SCREW YOU . \ 
5 . THAT’S OK : She is thinking long & hard on HOW & WHEN you will pay for your mistake . \

According to a recent survey , men say the first thing they notice about a woman is their eyes , and women say the first thing they notice about men is they're a bunch of liars . 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . Discover . ~ < PROPFIRST > Twain 
Never talk logically to an intellectual moron . Instead , just fart in their general direction . Same end result without the waste of time .

A study has revealed that the kind of face a woman finds attractive on a man can differ depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle . For example : if she's ovulating , she is attracted to men with rugged and masculine features . However , if she's menstruating or menopausal , she tends to be more attracted to a man with duct tape over his mouth and a spear lodged in his chest with a cricket bat up his backside while he is on fire . No further studies are expected on this subject . 
FOR ALL OF YOU WAITING IN HEAVEN :\ 
I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . \ 
I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . \ 
Your memory is a keepsake , from which I'll never part . God has you in his arms . I have you in my heart . \ 
Put this as your status if someone you miss is in heaven ? ?

WARNING :\ 
There is a < PROPFEMALE > RUS going around . It seems to be spreading all over the internet and the mainstream media . It may have started in Washington DC , < PROPFEMALE > Ave , Hollywood , or Langley < PROPFEMALE > , but it seems to be spreading like wildfire in the minds of men . It's called ' Poverty Consciousness ' . There is only one way to avoid this virus . It is through ' Controlling Your Thoughts ' and ONLY thinking about ' PROSPERITY ' . Deny all thoughts of lack and limitation from this moment forward . 
Thanks Kim ! \ 
The American flag does not fly because the wind moves past it . The American flag flies from the last breath of each military member who has paid the ultimate sacrifice protecting it . American soldiers don't fight because they hate what's in front of them , they fight because they love what's behind them . So while you're grilling this weekend and celebrating ... remember to thank a soldier . Re-post and show your support ! 
COUSIN WAR !!! Copy this if you are the smartest , most well behaved , best looking , and funniest of your cousins . If this stands an hour without a cousin protesting , you are the winner ! I dare you . It's on !! 
FRIENDS ARE LIKE PANTIES ... Some crawl up your butt . Some snap under pressure Some don't have the strength to hold you up . Some get a little twisted . Some are your favorite . Some are holy . Some are cheap . Some are naughty . And some actually cover your butt when you need them to . Re-post for all the friends you know and love , give them a laugh today !!!!! 
NYC Policemen and Firefighters are not invited to the 10th anniversary of 9/11 at Ground Zero ..... The mayor claims there isn't room for them . They weren't invited on that day in 2001 either .

HOW TO TREAT A WOMAN :\ 
Wine her . Dine her . Call her . Hold her . Surprise her . \ 
Compliment her . Smile at her . Listen to her . Laugh with her . Cry with her . \ 
Romance her . Encourage her . Believe in her . Cuddle with her . Shop with her . Give her jewelry . Buy her flowers . Hold her hand . Write love letters to her . Go to the ends of the earth and back again for her . \ 
HOW TO TREAT A MAN :\ 
Show up naked . Bring chicken wings & beer . Don't block the TV . 
We are what we repeatedly do . Excellence then , is not an act , but a habit . \ 
-Aristotle 
One day , you'll want me ; like I wanted you . One day , you'll need me ; like I needed you . One day ... One day , you'll love me ; but I won't love you . \
