Had a great time @ Barrister's Ball last nite ! Plus , woohooo for NBA playoffs starting ! Too bad a Texas team has to be knocked out so early . 
good game so far !!! go .... Sp ... I mean Mav ... I mean ROCKETS !!!! 
thinks I do not aim with my hand ; He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father . I aim with my eye . I do not shoot with my hand ; He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father . I shoot with my mind . I do not kill with my gun ; He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father . I kill with my heart . 
thinks all the Mavs fans should've taken the Spurs more seriously . Then again , so should the Mavs . 
wants you to wish me luck ! 
sees that experience pulls through again . Its the curse of the Spurs for < PROPFIRST > . The only time the Mavs have ever beaten them , they choked heavily in the Finals ... and here , yet again , an ever-so-promising year for the Mavericks is ended by the 7th seed San < PROPFIRST > . Its this kind've play that could bring about a 5th championship . < PROPFIRST > , you never cease to disappoint . 
Lols at Lebron < PROPFIRST > ... not the < PROPMALE > yet

would like to thank the group of ministers that tipped me 8% tonight , you truly proved that you wont give 10% to anyone but God . There is one thing though .. Biblically , God asks for 10% of ohh everything you make . I just ask for 15-20% on your total < PROPMALE > . Oh well hopefully the extra goes to the Church , or upgrading all of your iPhones . ok rant over , I can now move on . 
is bummed that there is no T : < PROPFEMALE > Chronicles Season 3 . Just finished season 2 and it looked like the next season would've been fantastic . 
If I trust in prayer to do the works\ 
that hands can do , \ 
then I'm only praying and not working\ 
with my hands , \ 
so I only hope it will change the\ 
things that hands cant . Then , as much as I can do\ 
I will do with my hands , \ 
and then I pray with those hands as well .

thinks what is this , Horseville ??? ... cause I'm surrounded by nay-sayers !!! 
thinks this is the worst home plate ump all postseason . W T F ? So many wide-left balls called strikes , and now the Yanks score cuz hes blind . 
thinks that was a blast - good job rangers ! 
hopes the Rockets dont blow this , itd be a GREAT first win 
wishes every night this week had turned out differently 
thinks the costume was a hit . Good show tonight ! 
occassionally thinks back to watching Tropic Thunder , and how I think it might be one of the WORST comedies that I've ever seen ... and then I think how I live in the greatest country in the world . Then I think of how the greatest country in the world reviewers gave it an 83% rating . Thats higher than Iron Man . Then I just feel sad . 
has to make himself stop playing Angry Birds 
thinks seriously ? They lost AGAIN ? Why did I even buy NBA League Pass this season ... 
wishes ppl w/ 20 items wouldnt go thru the self-checkout line ... 
wishes he was camping and/or singing with the Mr. Moore choir tonight . Ah wells .... 
is hoping for 2-5 tonight 
is so SO so incredibly frustrated 
thinks you should wait til SKYLINE comes out on DVD . Then , don't watch the DVD . 
missed my baby all day today 
finds it funny that I got stuck at the railroad tracks right after watching Unstoppable last night . Good movie , I liked it . 
thinks so ... the Rockets were up by 8 , then 4min later down by 10 ??? Sometimes i cant stand basketball . 
wants you to put these in order of most favorite to least favorite : waffles , pancakes , french toast . GO ! 
knows this is random , but I seriously had no idea that < PROPFIRST > Tait was now the lead singer of Newsboys .... W T ...? wow . 
wishes the 2010-11 season was over already . I don't care if theres 70 more games , this is the worst basketball I've seen in 20 years and its maddening . 
knows < PROPFEMALE > and SMU will do great today !!! 
wants you to know that NICHOLE'S TEAM ADVANCED !!!!!!! 
well , here's a first : I'm actually turning off the game for good at halftime because I can't stand to watch anymore . thats bad . 
wonders if DIE HARD can count as a Christmas flick ? 
is about to watch LIVE Rockets basketball vs OKC - thank you < PROPFEMALE > ! 
thinks that was a GREAT game . Rockets beat Lakers , woohoo !!!! 
is now officially a hair model ! lolz ! 
knows now that according to a sarcastic and confrontational < PROPMALE > customer , I am ARGUMENTATIVE and an ASS !... lol . 
is starting to get addicted to FRINGE 
thinks WOW @ Lebrons in-game shot-clock beating , turn-around , behind-and-over-the-backboard shot last night . 
really enjoyed the late showing of TRON : LEGACY 3D tonight - no complaints ! good fun !!! 
cannot WAIT to get put of here today ... wtfomfg 
is watching the lunar eclipse of the heart 
wants you guys to know ... she said YES ! :) 
thinks its going to be a looooong day 
thinks YAY ! for impulse buys 
just watched < PROPMALE > blow a 13-pt 4th quarter lead to the Blazers , after coming back from 10-down to take that 13-pt lead . god sometimes I hate basketball . 
is about to watch the Rockets lose in the final 2 minutes to the Jazz , after being in the lead for the entire game . I am going to lose my mind . 
is about to watch the Rockets play the Celtics . Tonight , < PROPMALE > will be without Yao < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Miller , and < PROPMALE > Hayes . In the words of < PROPFEMALE > , its almost like the Rockets AREN'T playing tonight . 
has been listening to the new recording of \Bright Eyes\ " by Abandon City ! and cant wait to let you guys hear the final product soon " 
just watched < PROPMALE > lose their 3rd out of 4th games while holding a double-digit lead in the 4th quarter . GGGGGODDDDDDDDDDDD !!!! 
is glad < PROPMALE > pulled it out against the Hawks , good game !!! < PROPFIRST > Hill and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > were awesome . 
doesnt feel very good . 
is glad the Rockets are feasting on the East as of late ! Won 3rd out of 4 games , including W's vs . Boston , Atlanta , and Milwaukee - I'll take it ! 
just watched < PROPMALE > blow a 12-pt 3rd quarter lead to Memphis . I swear , everytime they do something impressive , they have to counter it by doing something equally as stupid . 
hatea when < PROPMALE > plays < PROPFIRST > . Even when the Rockets were good n healthy , the Mavs always give us fits ... 
thinks a 7 hr bank shift is 7 hrs too long . 
wants to thank everyone that came tonight . It really meant a lot to us !!!! 
thinks ... LUCKY ME ! 
is annoyed . 
thinks its sad that Gasol can just yell and get fouls called . The Rockets have played a great game , but all this guy has to do is raise his voice and get FTs . wow for phantom calls . Also , no Rocket shot FTs in LA besides < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Nice home-cooking for LA from the zebras . It took OT and some BS for LAL to win ... oh well . 
ROCKETS WIN !!!! After a tough loss in OT last night to Lakers , Rockets win by 1 in the final seconds vs Jazz in Utah !!!! wooohoooo ! 
looks outside and thinks it'll be snow problem getting to work 
thinks its beautiful outside ... and sooo slow and boring at the bank . 6 hrs feels like 16 . 
is going to miss my sweetheart today . 
cant believe the Rockets are about to lose to the Twolves . Good job beating Utah , Memphis , and < PROPMALE > ... then losing to Minnesota . geez . 
thinks its sad that I sent < PROPFEMALE > on a Treasure Hunt on < PROPFIRST>'s Day and on clue #2 she got a flat ... 
any iPHONE users , android now has Words with Friends , and i want competition ! Search for me : bro2044 
had to stop a fight between friends tonight . Thats a first . Happy bday me . 
thanks you guys ! you all rock 
saw that Hollywood wants to remake \The Bodyguard\ " .... wow I feel old . " 
hopes Thabeet , Dragic , and a couple 1st rd draft picks can help turn the Rockets fortunes a bit 
is a happy Rockets fan tonight ! < PROPMALE > shoots 58% and slaughters the Blazers in Portland to win their 5th straight ( and 6 of 7 ) to reach . 500 and climb even closer to those final playoff spots ! next 3 games ??? Clippers , Pacers , Kings . C'mon guys , one big push to try to knock out the slumping Nuggets and Jazz !!! 
thinks it must be nice to be < PROPFIRST > Griffin . You're a rookie and already getting BS \superstar calls \"..." 
I tell ya ... watching 15 episodes of Spartacus and then going to work for customer service really makes you wanna kill some ppl ... just sayin ' 
hopes the Rockets can pull it out tonight against PHX , or the playoffs may become out of reach . Lots of W's lately tho ! 
thinks that a 6:30 am-12 shift , taking care of state inspection , insurance problems , FW speeding ticket , vehicle registration , new driver's license and an oil change so far today has made it a lonnnnng day so far . 
thinks the Rockets are getting robbed in PHX tonight ... 
is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO angry right now . 
is gonna miss my baby , and not get to see her again til Tuesday :( 
Rockets take lead into the 4th against Spurs after an AMAZING 3Q finish by Patterson and Lowry , wooohoooooo , keep it up !!!! 
thinks it must be nice to have the refs in their pocket like the Spurs do tonight . Pathetic showing by the stripes in a close game . 
wants you to all keep your ears to the ground . Abandon City ! wants shows , so if you hear anything then let us know and the socks will be rocked !!! 
thinks that 99.9% of the popular music of today makes me sad . 
loves when people talk about how awesome they are . Its just so awesome , and I feel awesome for them . 
would like to thank < PROPFEMALE > for being the Rockets good luck charm ! Every game weve gone to together ( vs spurs , thunder , and now Boston ! ) were all wins ! Woohoo ! 
Rockets win again !!! Woohooo , win over the Jazz puts them in 9th ( 1.5 gms behind MEM ) and 11-3 since the all-star break ! 
thinks that there enough superstar calls for the Heat when it was just < PROPMALE > . Now w/ Lebron and Bosh it seems like there's enough for both teams ... but theyre all Miami's . A good game tho ... 125-119 , too bad my Rockets couldnt finish ' em off in the end . 
is excited about all the show coming soon for Abandon City ! & The New Militia !!! 
thinks secret secrets are no fun . Secret secrets hurt someone . 
thinks ( sorry Mavs fans ) that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is a little b*tch . 
is enjoying a little Amazon Cloud 
is getting really pissed about this game . Atlanta cant miss a jumperband < PROPMALE > has 9 turnovers in 20min ??? 
WOOHOOO Rockets pull it out against Atlanta ! < PROPMALE > takes down another playoff-bound team , WHAT a run since the All-Star break . 
... 
hopes New Orleans enjoys the homecooking . Its the 3rd quarter and < PROPMALE > has 3 FTs all game . Must be nice to have the refs in your back pocket ... 
Dear < PROPMALE > Customers - A great opportunity has come ! A new ESL class is going to be held each day as you are walking into the lobby 
was going to go to the mall today . Then i remembered it was Saturday . Thats Saturday , at the mall . I will not be going to the mall . 
wonders if they arrested DJ Optimus or DJ Starscream in the case for the DJ Megatron slaying . 
for those of you bored in < PROPFIRST > tonight , or near Deep Ellum , come out to see my band ( The New Militia ) @ Reno's Chop Shop , near Elm/Malcolm X - last minute , but it'll kick the ayazz ! 
has to open the bank tomorrow , but doubts that I'll get a wink of sleep tonight . 
NBA Finals preference ? Spurs vs Bulls ( sorry Mavs fans)\ 
\ 
stupid NBA Finals inevitability ? probably Lakers vs Heat\ 
worst outcome : Miami NBA champs 
gets to work 7 hrs with no break @ < PROPMALE > , then just change and go right over to Silver Fox - lookin forward to today , yipeeee !.... 
THE NEW MILITIA tomorrow night @ the Curtain Club !!! Go go ! 
THE NEW MILITIA @ CURTAIN CLUB in a couple hrs , if youre free come partake ! 
cant believe its HAILING right now in Grapevine !!! and there's the tornado siren ...? 
ABANDON CITY ! SHOW CANCELED Saturday Night , sorry guys - WE MAY have a change of venue , will update event , but for now there is no 23rd show @ the Bandwagon 
wonders how many of you will be in line for the new iDEA , or just save up for the iDEA 2 ... lolz 
thinks theres a minimum amount of customers today , with a maximum amount of insanity . Omg lolz 
got Portal 2 in the mail yesterday , wooohooo cant wait to play ! 
finds ot funny that Gaga called ppl retarded for thinking Born This Way sounded like a plagarized Express Yourself - lolz sorry lady , any 1/2-a55ed musician can tell the rip-offs amd similarities of melodies AND progressions in that song . It literally sounds like it . 
sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry , I dont know my account number , but heres my card . sorry 
btw fellow portalites - Portal 2 is awesome . Great graphics , great humor , great physics puzzles . Xtra :D 
would like to thank all those who came to see Abandon City ! Turned out to be an AWESOME show , and we appreciate every one of you ! 
is looking forward to the Knicks being swept . I'm so tired of hearing about that overrated team . You went . 500 with 2 All-Stars & D'Antoni on your team . Big whoop . 
is bummed that the heavy rainstorm turned into a bright , < PROPFEMALE > day 
thinks that isnt the Spurs team I expected coming into the playoffs ... but credit the Grizzlies . I'd almost rather see the Thunder and Memphis battle it out as opposed to any \traditional\ " West teams of the last decade moving forward . " 
thinks WOW that is SO sad for the Spurs ... < PROPMALE>'s foot was on the line . Its a 2 , and that means its pretty much over . I never thought MEM would win this 4-1 . Man oh man ... that is terrible to get to make that shot and it not be a 3 . 
would like to restate my Finals preference : OKC vs . < PROPFIRST > . Watching Durant and the Thunder tonight ... my god , the man was unbelievable . Watching Durant vs < PROPFEMALE > would be something special . This year's playoffs has been some of the best basketball I've seen in a while . Three great games tonight , geez . 
thinks a lot of people are still underestimating Memphis . OKC is awesome , and I love Durant and Westbrook ... but the Grizz still beat them 3 out of 4 times in the reg season , and have just gotten better . We'll see . 
Ladies - I'm waiting on < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Green , Horror Buffs - < PROPFIRST > Englund . ;) 
thinks lol , and thats why < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is an idiot 
FREE SHOW TONIGHT in Fort Worth @ the Cellar ! Abandon City LIVE , go go go !!!! 
Mavs up 3-0 on LA , WOW !!! 
Thanks so much tonight guys , small venue , AWESOME show !!! 
THE NEW MILITIA is playing tonight in < PROPFIRST > !!! COME OUT to the Prophet Bar in Deep Ellum , show starts around 11 ! 
I LOVE YOU MOM !!! Happy Mother's Day ! 
OMG MAVS , lol 63-39 @ half ???? Pooor < PROPFEMALE > 
thinks its funny that now there's all these outcries that Bin Laden's \watery grave\ " wasn't actually in accordance with Islamic tradition ( land-loved or not ) ... and was in fact completely against it . I can't say which way is true ... it just all bothers me . 10+ years . Quick raid . OBL dead . 2-minute DNA test . Dump him in the ocean . No pictures or video shared . Done . " 
in brighter news : < PROPFIRST > Reedus ( Boondock Saints ) is credit as taking the role of < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > in the future \The Dark Tower\ " film directed by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( w/ < PROPMALE > Bardem as < PROPMALE > ) - PUMPED !!! " 
thinks it is AMAZING outside today 
would like to thank all those who came to the New Militia show last night @ Tomcats West in FW , you ROCK !!! 
is sooooooo tired . 
feels bad for the Grizz , I always root for the underdog , but in this case I feel GREAT for < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and the Thunder ! congrats to an ol ' Rockets champ and here's to a good WCFinal series ! 
needs a day job . Anyone know of any solid par t-t ime ( ... full ? ) openings during the AM , send me a msg and we'll talk . 
thinks this turned from an AMAZING game into a snorer . 3 anda 1/2 quarters of competition ... now OKC is stinking it up ( or Barea's just kicking that much A$$ ! ) 
thinks DENG , what a SHOT ! 
whos ready for the end of the world ?!?!?!?! 18min countdown ! 
thinks its time to drop some pounds ... 
simply cannot believe that the Mavs won that game . I may not be a fan exactly , \ 
but I may be starting to become a believer . Wow . 
thinks thats definitely a thunderstorm , hail ... and a tornado siren . Time to sit back and enjoy the game ...? 
just watched a couple 9/11 docs , didn't realize they were going to be conspiracy theory . Some things I had already thought of , some points are stretches , but overall theres a LOT of unanswered crap about that day that I didn't realize because I was so overwhelmed . When theres so much going on , the simplest explanations are usually the easiest , I just didn't realize some of the potential BS we were fed on that day 
cant lie , < PROPFIRST > you've been incredible this postseason . Another late game comeback - good luck against the ( most likely ) Heat !!!! 
can't believe I've never seen Reality Bites before 
cant believe what I just saw . Poor Chicago ... a 16-2 run by Miami in last few minutes to take lead . Wow . Another DAL-MIA Finals ! Both teams playing unbelivably , both closing games incredibly , both taking out younger , more athletic teams . Its gonna be good . 
thinks THAT was an awesome show an amazing night . I can't believe its past 530am .... gah 
wonders if there was nobody else , would you march by yourself ? 
was up til almost 7am , got up at 3pm , and now its 7pm and it feels like 3pm . bah ! 
< PROPMALE > !!!!!!!!! 
just made my FINAL payment on my largest < PROPFEMALE > from college . That chunk of change is now MINE ( well ... credit card's ? ) each month from now on . WOOHOO !!!

has an interview as a sales rep for Verizon today , heading out now . Wish me luck ! 
< PROPMALE > ! wow !!!!!! 
just found all 5 seasons of the 90s X-Men animated series on Amazon . ... very tempting . 
http://i54.tinypic.com/219xycx.jpg 
Chalmers AGAIN ?!?!?! Gah !! 
Barea and < PROPFIRST > are tonights heroes ! WHAT a GAME ! 
Congrats < PROPFIRST > !!! < PROPMALE > & co have been incredible , and im glad you guys finally get that wonderful choked up nba champ feel . Also , LOL @ Heat ! 
heard a dumb joke ... so I liked it and wanted to share it : How do you know you've found Lebron < PROPFIRST>' cell phone ? It vibrates and receives calls , but doesn't have a ring ! 
got another one ... If ? you asked Lebron change for a dollar he'll give you 75cents . Why ? Because Lebron doesn't have a 4th quarter . 
misses his < PROPFEMALE > 
thinks its time for Weinberger's! 
just played F.E.A.R 2 for a couple of hrs w . headphones on in the dark . somethin ' creepy bout that ... 
Come over to Montalena and celebrate Nicholes bday w us by the pool ! Also , bbq and sand vball !

Thinks mosh pits are lame , always have been . Please stop . 
would like to thank the 70+ for coming out last night just for TNM . You make it all worth it ! 
enjoyed TFormers 3 : DOTM . Its long yes , but has a decent plot and , once again , amazing special effects . Its not as annoying and incoherent as the worst parts of 2 , and keeps you pretty dang interested for the 150+min time . I've seen it twice , and if you liked the first ( and maybe the 2nd ? ) you'll enjoy . If not , then why bother ? 
is glad I didn't go for the 90s X-MEN DVDs on Amazon ... because no more than 2 weeks later they are ALL on Netflix . Rock . Time for a little Night of the Sentinels during cleanup . 
is bummed that Yao is retiring . I know it was a longshot that he'd be able to do anything great again ... but it still hits hard . 
If anyone knows cars , I'm getting a low hum/tension when I turn my steering wheel . Its almost like a groan . My power steering is full , so its not that . Thanks . 
Friday , 08/12 , The New Militia FINALE SHOW @ The Curtain Club !!! , < PROPFIRST > your calendars ppls !!!!!! 
thinks its because you're a droid and I'm a ' noid . 
cant find his wallet . I've never lost my wallet and feel like I'm going to lose my mind . 
just spent the last couple of hours cancelling and reordering all the cards that were in my lost wallet ... now I'm sure to find it . 
is bummed that Universal dumped the Dark Tower , but relieved that the big screen wasn't given the opportunity to potentially ruin a great story . 
thinks thats very clever Worf ... Eat any good books lately ? 
can't stand how its always the little things that completely ruin a wonderful day . 
thinks you guys should set some plans in stone for Friday night , The New Militia is headlining @ THE CURTAIN CLUB for its finale show , and it will be a show to remember . Its a late gig , so all you restaurant people can actually set your eyes on a concert you can make ! 
had a 2-min nightmare where I was in the woods at night and came to this frozen pond with an abandoned house on the other end . I was going to turn around but I saw child footsteps cross the ice & snow over the pond going up to the house . 
just did the \piece of tape\ " trick to Onyx ... and it was friggin ' hilarious . " 
finds it funny that the band tonight @ Red River is called ' Runnin Behind ' ... are they always late , or just have trouble keeping up with the beat ? 
is practicing keys again for tonight . Gonna be awesome ! 
would like to thank all of those who made it out last night . It meant the world that you came to the New Militia's finale show !!! 
is rather bummed that I havent seen Planet of the Apes yet ... ah well , maybe Tuesday . 
wishes Onyx would stop sticking his HEAD into everything ... cups full of water ( then knocking them over ) , the garbage disposal ... 
thinks The Help is a really , REALLY good movie . 
is glad Gates MsFadden ( Dr. Crusher ) didn't direct any other TNG episodes ... because \Genesis\ " is the stupidest episode by far . " 
thinks the Paranormal Activities should never have been released in theaters . They should be watched in the silence of your own home in the middle of the night , no lights on , no sounds . If you can completely suspend your reality , I don't have a problem with these films . In a crowded theater tho , yes , I could see why they may seem stupid . 
has been having terrible sleep due to continuous dreams ( wake up , go back to sleep , be at same part in dream moving further forward ) for 5 days now . I've neve been able to remember dreams except maybe twice a year at most ... now I'm having a LOT of vivid ones that just DON'T stop . 
is excited that Abandon City ! is getting back on its feet ! cant wait to get some real recordings up 
feels like watching The Mist . So I shall . 
thinks facebooks video conversion sucks just like anywhere else I guess , but good to have a few vids up of The New Militia's finale concert 
had a great time at the Rangers game earlier ( 8-1 !!! LA loses , thank you Yankees ! ) , and also Abandon City practice ! 3 new songs in the works . Good day . 
stupid Amazon 
had a really good practice today with Abandon City !, lookin ' forward to the end of the year 
stupid amazon . stupid postal service . GAH ! 
thinks it was TOTALLY worth the wait . 
would like to congratulate < PROPFIRST > Stark and < PROPFEMALE > Bailey-Stark as they officially are becoming parents ! Welcome to life , < PROPMALE > ! 
thinks you should never delete a gift card . ever ever ever ever , dont do it . I dont care what job you have or where you work , or if this doesn't even make sense - don't do it . No , no , there is no why . Nothing more will I teach you today . Clear your mind of questions . 
is thinking about getting a nice , wood digital-piano tomorrow , and doubling it as a midi controller for recording . I'm excited . 
GO RANGERS !!! 
is pretty sure DP10 is just 1/3 Dr Pepper and 2/3 Diet DP mixed together , not that I'm complaining . Still a coke and pepsi guy m'self . 
Rangers vs Tigers - lookin forward to it 
thinks it sucks that everyone wanted rain for so long ... and now look what its doing ... delaying and postponing our GAMES ! grrr . 
No worries guys , the worst Detroit can do is take it back to TX up 3-2 , and I really dont see the Rangers losing all 3 on the road . If there was one the Tigers would win , its this one . Go Rangers ! 
hopes The Walking Dead and American Horror Story are on for a while . cool . 
thanks you ASIO4ALL , for fixing my latency issues . woohoo !!! Now , back to Fringe Season 3 
thinks last night's episode of The Walking Dead was exceptionally good 
GO RANGERS !!!!!!!!!!
