IN THE LAND OF THE BLIND , THE ONE-EYED MAN IS < PROPMALE > Life is a circle , fear that which repeats . Ever are you stalked in the eyes of the Reaver , Long may you fear the < PROPFEMALE > Reaper . 

Isn't it ironic ? You ignore who adores you , adore who ignores you , love who hurts you , and hurt who loves you . 
Through the darkened woods you roam , In the shadows of the trees I am home . Rain trickles down from the sky , Before you I appear . If you wish I could fly , And < PROPFEMALE > you far away from here . 
Happy new year to all my people , you know who you are ! Hope all your dreams come true , and your resolutions work out . 
There are those who should fight , those who must fight , those that must be fought , and then there are those who have fought for so long that war is in there blood . An old soul can never die , but they can never be reborn . 
And were an epitaph to be my story I'd have a short one ready for my own . I would have written of me on my stone : I had a lover's quarrel with the world . - < PROPFIRST > Frost 
Forgive me my nonsense , as I also forgive the nonsense of those that think they talk sense . - < PROPFIRST > Frost 
To gaze upon a withered smile , So broken by hope lost , yet still clinging to flimsy denial . What right have you to induce such a trial ?! May you feel the true weight of the pain you inspire , from now until you have walked your last mile . -For all those who have been wronged and betrayed . And for those who have done the betraying . 
A mother takes twenty years to make a man of her boy , and another woman makes a fool of him in twenty minutes . - < PROPFIRST > Frost 
I watched Titanic when I got back home from the hospital , and cried . I knew that my IQ had been damaged . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
People want to know why I do this , why I write such gross stuff . I like to tell them I have the heart of a small boy ... and I keep it in a jar on my desk . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Life is a circle , fear what may repeat . 
Only enemies speak the truth ; friends and lovers lie endlessly , caught in the web of duty . ~ Stephen < PROPMALE > 
The place where you made your stand never mattered . Only that you were there ... and still on your feet . ~ Stephen < PROPMALE > 
I dare do all that may become a man ; Who dares do more , is none . ~ Macbeth , Act I , scene vii

Mother is the name for God on the lips of all Children . 
Mene , Mene , Tekel u-Pharsin . U have been weighed , measured , and found wanting . Your days have been numbered and brought to an end . Behold the writing on the wall . 
Nor law , nor duty bade me fight , Nor public men , nor cheering crowds , A lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds ~ William Butler Yeates 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Escalante , Passed away Tuesday March 31st 2010 at the age of 79 . Many of u will remember him as an incredible teacher who inspired the movie \Stand And Deliver \""

Out of everything thats happened so far , betrayal is still the worst pain . 
Experience : that most brutal of teachers . But you learn , my God do you learn . \

Friendship is unnecessary , like philosophy , like\ 
< PROPMALE > ... It has no survival value ; rather it is one of those things that\ 
give value to survival . \

just got back , passions fuckin rocks . Had a great time , we need to do it again SOON ! 
When you see my face , I hope it give you hell , I hope it gives you hell , When you walk my way , I Hope it gives you hell , I hope it gives you hell , If you find a man thats worth a damn and treats you well , Then he's a fool your just as well hope it gives you hell 
Tiger , Tiger , Burning Bright In the Forests of the Night . What Immortal , Hand or Eye Could Frame Thy Fearful Symmetry . 
So lately , been wonderin , Who will be there to take my place . \ 
When i'm gone , you'll need love , to light the shadows on your face . \ 
If a great wave shall fall , yeah fall upon us all , \ 
Then between the sand and stone , could you make it on your own ? \ 
If i could , Then i would , I'd go wherever you will go\ 
Way up high , or down low , \ 
I'd go wherever you will go . 
Alone sucks . But atleast if you are , no one can hurt you . 
Time , \ 
Neglect , and Indifference on your part has healed me of your plague which\ 
had corrupted the mind , poisoned the heart , and beffuddled the senses . \ 
Look upon me and despair . Bare you witness to what you have wrought . 
Oh boy , we all fucked up . Just don't give a shit about nobody or nothin no more . Just me and mine . 
Life is a Circle , Fear that which Repeats . 
As morning hues of sun swept fire caress your passion face . Alone with\ 
thee in pure < PROPFEMALE > , to worship your untold grace . My soul would cry in\ 
silent prayer , for hours spent apart . Your essence warms the evening\ 
air , as I dance into your heart . 
Through the darkened woods you roam , In the shadows of the trees I am home . Rain trickles down from the sky , Before you I appear . If you wish I could fly , And < PROPFEMALE > you far away from here . 
\A mother takes twenty years to make a man of her boy 
THERE IS ALWAYS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL , AND ALWAYS A SOLUTION , U JUST HAVE TO SEE THE RIGHT ONE WHEN IT COMES FOR YOU , OR RISK GETTING RUN OVER BY THE 8:20 EXPRESS 
ITS SO FLUFFY !!! 
The beauty of life is that it ends , which makes everything you do , \ 
everything you are , that much more vibrant . A candle , burning brightly\ 
in the night , shines all the more spectacularly right before it gutters\ 
out . So shine , shine enough to darken the sun . You never know when a\ 
stiff wind will blow you out . 
Come to the Dark Side ... We have Cookies ! 
Empty Inside . 
Lo there do i see my father , lo there do i see my mother and my sisters and my brothers . Lo there do i see the line of my people , back to the beginning . Lo they do call to me . They bid me take my place among them , in the halls of Valhalla , where the brave may live forever . 
Fuck it ! 
HATE BEING IN A CAST !!! 
\HOW ODD TO WATCH A MORTAL KINDLE . THEN TO DWINDLE DAY BY DAY . \ 
DWINDLE DWINDLE LADY THIMBLE , TAKE NOT MINE BLOOD FROM ME . FOR THE WORLD IS A COLD LONELY PLACE , AND THE CRUEL HAVE TAKEN WITH GLEE . MUCH MORE AND DARKNESS MAY I CLAIM , FOR ALREADY AM I TOO KNEE . BUT BE YOU WELL AND LIGHT OF HEART , FOR JUSTICE IS FOREVER METED BY THREE . ~ An Original 
In the back of my mind i can\ 
barely even remember when\ 
there was nothing left to hide and\ 
she has found a way inside , then\ 
i was forced to walk alone\ 
living in an empty home\ 
all i wanted was to hide and\ 
try to numb the ache inside\ 
and im still afraid of the light\ 
and a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise\ 
-Disturbed \Asylum \"" 
Thx everyone for the B-day wishes =P 
Tiger , Tiger , burning bright , in the forests of the night . What immortal , hand or eye , could frame thy fearful symmetry ? 
Do not go quietly into that good night ... \ 
Rage ! Rage against the dying of the light ! 
The brain is a wonderful organ . It starts working the moment you get up in the morning and does not stop until you get into the office . \ 
~ Robert Frost 
The curtain calls , and you sigh for me . Night falls , and you writhe for me . Darkness crawls forth , and you cry for me . Dream a little dream for me love . I would die for you , could you live for me ? \ 
~ Life is a wonderful motivator .
