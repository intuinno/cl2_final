Where in the $#@ ! did my status update go ?!!! 

Nurse < PROPFIRST > is on my mind . 
It appears that one of the marvelous new things with Face book is that it automatically dumps your status updates after 10 days . I am so happy about that , It makes me want to dump something else ! ARGH !!!......... OH YEAH , NURSE < PROPFIRST > RULES !!!!!!!!!!! 
My status is that I am sitting my arse on a chair , hunkered down in front of my laptop like I am every night !!!! 
The entire weekend that I spend with good friends , piles of kids , crazy eating , and sleep deprivation !!! 
Hoping my weekend will be somewhat similar to last weekend , maybe without the sleep deprivation . Lol . Not that I didn't love every second of it . =) 
I'm thinking exactly what I just told < PROPFEMALE > , \I guess I hoped in the right direction . \ " I would like to rewind the last two days and play them over again ! "

Completing the interior painting of my new house before all my stuff gets shoved in there on Monday ... also what to do with the stuff that doesn't fit . 
The miraculous event that the occurred when the owner of my new house looked at what me and a friend had already done to my place and gave me another week to do more , and get my furniture moved by them . 
If that last informative request was lengthy , how about this ... I could REALLY use some help figuring out where to place the stuff I will want and need the most and advice on how to store the rest or sort through and dispose . The realty is going to move me Monday , but that is going to be VERY messy without a plan . I big mess in my designer decorated cottage and yard . 
does anybody know a crafty way to get broken pieces of glass out of a loose bare soil yard that kids will be playing in ? I need to do this before I throw seed out !!! Help !!! 
My friends are on my mind . People who actually have my ultimate good in mind the whole time they are around me , how rare they are , and how much I appreciate them , and how infrequently I actually tell them because I would feel goofy and emotional , just like I do now . Heh , heh . Yep . It's true though . 
The grout cleaning residue on my tile floor after repeated mopping preventing me from putting down a good coat of sealant . 
How bad will my house stink after I pour about 3 gallons of white vinegar over the grout and tile , then mop it up ? GROSS . How do you get the stink out !!!??? YUCK . 
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . And/or call the White House ( comment line : 202-456-1111 , switchboard : 2 ...... 02-456-1414 ) and your representatives and say that the U.S. needs to prevent people from dying because they cannot afford health care
