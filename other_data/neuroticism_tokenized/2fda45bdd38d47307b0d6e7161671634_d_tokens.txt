Happy new year ! 

Doing all the homework I procratinated about =( 
Ap test tomorrow - hopefully it goes well =) . 
Fun Durarara fact : Kida ( Ryugamine's friend ) is voiced by the same person as Tamaki ( Ouran High School ) . ^.^ 
Just took the \Which Bleach Character are you ? \ " on < PROPFEMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > ; got Soifon O.o " 
We watched Ponyo in Japanese class today ! ( Sorry < PROPFEMALE > ) 
Just cause I'm tird of wondering whether people have seen it in my info blurbs , and to get it out there , I'd just like you all to know I'm bi ^.^ It's not really a big deal , it's just easier to have out than to wonder if anyone knows . Just please don't blurt out questions or comments loudly , especially in awkward places =P . 
Gonna play Risk with my family later today ! Yay ! 
Risk was good , but I lost =( . 
AP Chemistry tomorrow ! Fun times . 
^.^

I want to do something , but I don't have any plans or anything =\\ . 
Being Lazy 
* My brother has a band concert I'm getting dragged to today . =( * 
Cat going to the vet =( . 
I just got an ad on the side for Christian Manga =P . That can't end well . 
Now my cat has a funny collar thingy , to stop him from scratching his shoulder =\\ . At least it's cute . 
Giant notebook check from the beginning of the year . =( I have to hide all of my doodles ! Plus I need to find all the pages I've taken out and the ones that have fallen out ... 
Watched higurashhi no naku koro ni last night ... probably a bad idea to watch that before sleeping . Let's just say the arc I was watching has a rather ... gruesome death scene . Followed by laughter . 
Finished ????????? ( Higurashi no Naku Koro ni ) . Now I'm moving on to the next season . yay ! 
Watching Bones then Fringe ( finales ) 
Weekend ! Yay ! 
My brother has a camping trip all weekend . ( 1 ) I get to go to eat and park , and the soup is clam chowder . I love clam chowder ( 2 ) . I'm going over < PROPFIRST>'s house to watch anime/play brawl/whatever ( 3 ) 3 amazing things this weekend =) 
Today is going to be awesome . 
Watching UP 
Jelly Juice is delicious ! And I stole < PROPFIRST>'s cool pen =) . 
Gotta do dishes . Then back to facebook/DotA ! 
Dishes done ! Facebook creeping time ! 
???????????????? 
Accidentally sent out a friend request to someone I work with at church . I don't know if he saw that I'm bi , but I don't really want to bring that up with church people . so I had to unfriend him and ignore another person's friend request =( \ 
ALSO : Bribing < PROPFEMALE > with Jelly Juice drinks is fun =) Ry got some too . 
Doing random things =\\ 
Funny xkcd : http://www.xkcd.com/744/ 
\Just as planned ! \"" 
\Sir 
Having fun with \The < PROPFEMALE > Letter\ " by imagining homosexual undertones between Chillingworth and Dimmesdale =D . \ 
Playing Touhou 
Downloading all the touhou games 
YES ! Got Perfect < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > to work ( even patched it for english ! ) Woohoo ! Also got Double Spoiler to work using the same method . Hooray , I have working versions of all touhou games ! 
Ended up without any friend coming to my cookout thing =( . I only invited 4 people , but still =( . Alot of people came , but it was kinda boring . 
Crushed < PROPFIRST > in brawl online . 
Today was fun =) 
Watching a Doctor Who rerun . Also , I can't stop thinking of the sentence \??????????" 
Must ... beat ... advance wars ... black hole rising ~ 
Watching fun stuff . 
Only one more week of school ! 
At the arts festival 
2 hours of homeroom tomorrow =) 
I missed today's Doctor Who rerun =( . 
Doing church stuff 
Woo , had fun at Carlson's house and going to the Etna Fair later today . 
Content 
Yay ! Just checked my grades and got A's in everything scored except English 4th 9 weeks ( B ) and gym final ( B ) . Yay ! Still waiting on my Calc and English finals . 
Wow ... just watched the new Durarara and just .... wow ... O , O 
Not doing too much now , just gonna watch Doctor Who and < PROPFIRST > Black . 
WOO ! I have absolutely nothing left to do today , and nothing to do for a long while now . Hooray for summer ! And , sicne I have so much free time , if anyone wants to < PROPFEMALE > out I can probably make it somehow =) . 
Why are there so many people online at one o'clock in the morning ? 
I need to find stuff to do this summer =\\ . I really should get a job or some new hobbies , cause I'm already getting bored . 
If I had to pick exactly one anime to be a part of , I would probably pick ... hmmm probably Tsubasa . Many worlds to go to , plenty of magic , and enough opportunity for doing fun things that it would be worth the massive angst backstory I would have to have . 
Durarara was , once again , epic . Words cannot describe the sheer amount of epic . 
Why is everyone on at midnight , but noone is on at normal times ? I'm not even supposed to be up right now =P . 
I found doctor who episodes online ! Yay ! Although megavideo only lets me watch one and a half episodes at a time =( . But I'm almost caught up on this season and I can actually get ahead of what is shown on BBC < PROPFEMALE > if I want to =) . 
Het , I feel like hanging out with someone . So , if someone wants me to come over their house or if someone wants to come over , then just message me and I'll try to work out a good time . :] 
Watched Toy story three with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! It was awesome ! 
[ generic status update ] 
Watching fireworks at hampton park . 
Happy fourth of july ! 
I just had a moment of realization : In toy story 3 the garbageman ... that's < PROPMALE > ! From Toy Story 1 ! He's all grown up now ! 
POKE me if you've ever had a crush on me . LIKE this status if you think Im a\ 
good friend . Message me if you wanted a relationship with me . COMMENT on\ 
this if we've had some good memories together . Let's see who's brave \ 
enough to put this as their status . ( Stolen from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - I'm curious to see the response =P ) 
I'm so tired . Ugh . I've been having such a hard time going to sleep recently . 
\I'm bored . \ " \ " Then do your summer homework . \ " \ " Nevermind I found something to do ! \"" 
Yay ! Got my AP test results today ! Woohoo ! 
Hey , does anyone wanna see \Dispicable Me\ " with me tommorrow ? It's playing at 2:55 at the Waterworks cinema and I'll be there to watch it if anyone wants to come . " 
Hey , if anyone ever wants to watch a movie at the waterworks cinema , send me a message . I can take a bus there so I can pretty much get there whenever I want . 
So , I'm going to the mall ( < PROPMALE > Park ) today ( Saturday ) , is anyone else gonna be there ? \ 
\ 
After that I'm having relatives over at my house for a week , so I won't really be available to < PROPFEMALE > out or watch movies though =( . My mom is getting married to her fiancee ( parents divorced , so her second mairrage ) , which is pretty neat =) . 
I got a haircut ! Pics soon ( hopefully ) 
I'm changing my nickname from \The Lord of Darkness\ " to \ " The Lord of Entropy\ " \ 
Ugh , i hate watching baseball , but i have to go since my cousins are here . And of course , it's being delayed due to inclement weather :( . 
Got starcraft 2 ! Yay ! 
I'm thinking about dying my hair blue . Any thoughts/advice ? 
Well , my mom is officially married now =) \ 
My counsins are leaving later this Saturday too . 
Nothing important to say , my old status was getting stale ! 
Failed my driving test =( 
Even cracked thinks that stopping the mosque being built near ground zero is rediculous . Yay ! 
Generic Status 
School has begun , and I need to escape from computer applications 1 ! I'll probably have to wait until Friday to get out of it though ; they are only fixing schedules until then I believe , not changing electives ( that I didn't pick ! )\ 
On the plus side , all of my other classes are gonna be really fun ! I'm a little scared uof APUSH and AP Eng Lit , but I like all my teachers and everything seems like it's gonna be good =) . 
FMA was depressing this week =( . I didn't even watch it cause I know how sad that episode is . 
I keep forgetting to update this so umm ... maybe I'll do one of those 25 things tag 25 people thingies . What do you guys think ? 
Enjoying the anime series Monster . Pretty entertaining psychological thriller . It's on demand and probably on the internet somewhere for anyone interested .

Woo , reached < PROPFEMALE > level in SCII (/nerdgasm ) 
Hey , what < PROPFEMALE > did we need to read to in \A Hundred Years of Solitude \"?" 
So , somehow I ended up writing a < PROPFEMALE > and a half for the physics lab , and turned it into a 5-paragraph essay =P . It seemed like it just needed to be a short little thing , but I just ended up typing alot . 
Well , since Monday was national coming out day , I might as well do this . If you forgot or never noticed ( been on my facebook < PROPFEMALE > and have had conversations since forever ) , but I am bisexual . ^.^ 
Homecoming was fun =) . It's actually the first homecoming ( and high school football game ) that I've ever gone to . 
Got a pack of 50 coloured pencils ! Woohoo ! Time to color in my drawings . 
I just wrote a huge essay for my gate field trip blog ( talking about the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Lecture for Advanced High School Math Students . ) Why doesn't this energy ever go to doing homework though =( .

Writing the majority of my speech contest speech today . No idea when I will practice it , but I will not leave the computer until I have a speech ! ( also getting off facebook now lol )

So , I found some radical liberal sites , pretty fun . Glad to see that crazy exists everywhere . ( god I hate political systems ) 
I managed to finish my Gaul essay much faster than I anticipated . Which was really cool . \ 
( May have something to do with the fact that I forgot my book at school , and therefore couldn't quote anything D: )

Admitted to Case Western :) 
Today I learned that in the Vatican , the legal age of consent is 12 . It is the youngest in the world ( tied with Phillipines/traveling Americans with a small age gap ) . \ 
( source : http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm ) 
Did not make it into CMU =( 
Couldn't go to tekko ; they stopped selling badges to get in at 12 or so , and I could only get that at 2:30 at the earliest =( . Oh well , I can always go next year .
