Happy New Year all ! Hopefully we can start this year off on the right foot .... Cuz my left one's sore ! 

OK , I OFFICIALLY HATE WINTER ! Had to give < PROPFIRST > his first breathing treatment in months tonight . Mi pobre cito ! He lives such a crazy life . 
Well , lets see , it's almost 1 AM and < PROPFIRST>'s still up . Stormie is asleep , but I'm ready for bed . What a life I have being a single mom . Kinda crazy sometimes ! 
Going to look for part time work this week . 
< PROPFIRST > had surgery this morning ... still trying to recover ... NOT fun ! 
It's still light outside at 9 PM ! Makes it hard to go to bed ... 
I have decided that anything over 95 degrees all feels the same .... TOO DAMN HOT ! 
Went to Stockyards .... So fun ! O ya , another perk : MET HOT GUY . LMFAO 
We went to the rodeo tonight , and we had a blast . Met < PROPMALE > again tonight and told him to call me sometime . We shall see ! 
Ok , so the fourth was ok . Not like what I'm used to , but it works I guess . Now , I'm bored and the only thing I need to do is go to walmart ..... Not what I'd call fun . And still no call from < PROPMALE > , so I'm thinking I'll give up on that idea . 
Well , I've talked to < PROPMALE > a few times ... Need an artist to help me out though . And need help with work ideas !!! 
Posting a pic of a tat I want ..... Everyone let me know what you think . Not something I'm getting til Stormie is done but need to get ideas together . 
I wish I had a bunch of money . I so wanna go see < PROPFIRST > Aldean this weekend . Guess that's what you get when your a single parent ! No money and no time . : 0p 
YAY !!! got some of the pics from < PROPFEMALE > so uploading them now . My kids are so damn cute its crazy !! 
Alright they are up !!! Hope everyone has as much fun looking at them as I did ! THANK YOU < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
It's friday .... I have no plans , but all the time in the world . What a life ! 
Got a problem with me ? Solve it . Think I'm trippin ? Tie my shoe . Can't stand me ? Sit down . Can't face me ? TURN THE HELL AROUND ! My new life motto ! 
Got a problem with me ? Solve it . Think I'm trippin ? Tie my shoe . Can't stand me ? Sit down . Can't face me ? TURN THE HELL AROUND ! My new life motto ! 
Went swimming with my little man today n had a blast ! Maybe we'll repeat it tomorrow . We shall see ! Applying for work , so we will see how things go . 
Swimming with < PROPFIRST > is fun , but I wish he understood that he will drown if he doesnt pay attention !!! 
Went to the lake , had a blast . Took some pics so I'll have to post um later ! 
I am about 3 days from being a full time student !! Should be interesting !! 
I have an interveiw tomorrow !! YIKES !! Not quite sure how I might juggle school and work and kids but I am sure I will make due ! 
I have a headache .... and the day hasnt started off all that great . Any1 have any ideas of what Icould do so I'm not stuck here all day ??? 
I was a card dealer last night ..... Had fun ! To bad there isnt a casino to work in around here . That could be a job for me 
Started school yesterday ..... finding out that they cant do what I want though .... WHATEVER ! Guess I will do it their way 
It's hot .... Stormie is cranky today , but < PROPFIRST > went to see PaPa with Gramma . Hope they are having fun ! 
OMG I hate night time . My kids don't know how to shut up ! And now Stormie is trying to get teeth , she thinks she needs to be held to go to sleep . 
ok , at what point can i call it quits with < PROPFIRST > ????? I got him into bed , gave him a car and a cup of water ... so what does he go and do ? DUMPS HIS WHOLE CUP OF WATER ON HIS PILLOW !!! 
OK , 4:15 < PROPFIRST > is just about asleep . And people wonder why I am crazy ! 
Stormie has a Corneal Abrasion . Can we say not fun !?!?! My poor baby . Amazingly , she slept pretty well . Thank god for numbing eye drops ! 
YAY ! new computer , printer , external harddrive and all the goodies to boot ! I'm officially a happy camper 
OMG if I have to hear another < PROPMALE > movie , I swear I will be admitted to a nut house ! They are driving crazy more than usual today !

Just another day .... I love the rain but does it have to be so grey between showers ? 
Football n Nascar , a cup of coffee , and content kids .. life's good ! 
Cuddled for an hour with sister this morning ... What an awesome way to start my day ! 
Frusterated with school , can't figure out stupid fallacies . Anyone have any idea where I can turn for help ? I DON'T GET IT !!!! 
Happy Halloween to all ! Dressing kids up , but will probably only make it up the street n back ... 
Done trick or treating . A few pics are posted !! 
I hate being in a house full of sickos ! I wanna java chiller from sonic , but don't wanna eat it in front of sick ppl that all want sonic blasts .... Not fair ! 
OK ! It's official ! I have no freaking idea what I'm supposed to be doing for this assignment ! I NEED HELP ! It's something about premises , arguements , conclusions ..... could all be in Russian and I wouldn't understand less !!! 
OK so I have to know ... is it considered the butt crack of < PROPFEMALE > if the sun hasn't cracked ??? Or it considered the middle of the freakin night ?? It's 5:30 and sister thinks it's time to be awake ... HA ! Sadly mistaken ! 
Ok ....... finally in week 8 of these classes , thank goodness !! Now just have to find a balance between kids , school , puppy and dave ...... should be interesting ! 
OMG how time flies ! Stormie pulled herself up for the first time tonight ! My poor baby is growing up so fast ! So much has happened this week alone ... 5th tooth , First time sitting alone , first word , first time pulling up ....!!!!! 
Ok , it is nights like tonight that make me crazy ! Stormie went to sleep early ! But do I get to go to bed early ?? HELL NO ! < PROPFIRST > decided tonight , he wants to not have a brain that is functioning n thump around all night instead of sleep ! Some days I hate being a mom . 
Happy Turkey day ! Gotta love today for food n football ! 
Whoa . I just realized , it is Stormie's first Thanksgiving ! My baby is growing up so fast !!! Happy Turkey day all ! 
All I can say is whoa . Maybe I hate holidays after all . 
UGH ! I hate night time ! Got both kids to sleep before 1 , and < PROPFIRST > ends up waking up screaming AGAIN ! Nightmares need to be a thing of the past before I lose my mind ! 
In an awesome mood ! The things you can accomplish when you show someone the TRUTH ! 
You know it's winter when it's SNOWING !!! AND STICKING !!! It was 60 here not but 4 days ago , and I thought we'd never see the cold weather ! I'll post pics when it gets light ! 
So stick that in your juice box & suck it ! 
A little more time .... Just one more minute ... Can't ask for more . 
Too awesome !!!!! Going with < PROPFEMALE > while gets her nose pierced . Gunna get my eyebrow done . And what about an industrial ??? any feedback guys ??? 
The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible 
LETS GO MCCOY ! GET IT TO SHIPLEY AND LETS GO ! TAKE IT TO THE HOUSE ! HOOK ' EM HORNS !!!! 
Hells YEA ! 1 second left , and < PROPFIRST > boots it 46 yards to win 12-13 over Nebraska ! WOOT !!! HOOK ' EM HORNS ! 
Happy birthday to you , Happy birthday to you , Happy birthday to < PROPFIRST > , HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ! I love you little man ! Can't believe 5 years ago , he showed up ! What an emotional rollercoaster ! 
Crazy week ahead ..... Being a mom is a full time job plus some ! < PROPFIRST>'s got a PT eval scheduled , and we are working on scheduling OT and ST 3 days a week ....... On top of other things going on , it's crazy !! 
My world has officially gone from chaotic to phsychotic . 
Ok so here's my dillemma ... I need pain ! Just enough to tie me over tho . So what should I do ? I wanna get pierced since it's the next best thing to tattoos .... but since I'm the black sheep of the family , I'll have to hear about it ! HELP ! 
Ok , so the eyebrow is done , feelin awesome ! Thought I'd get to enjoy it a lil longer , but BACK TO REALITY ! Had a little bit of a meltdown this morning ..... but I will live , I always do ! At least I have pics that make me smile . 
Well , I had somewhat of a productive day . Got a bunch of school assignments started , got to talk to < PROPFIRST > for a long time , Stormie is in bed and < PROPFIRST > is on his way soon ! Lets just hope therapy goes well tomorrow ! 
Ok , so Speech Therapy today .... I'm feeling good so all WILL go well ! Now if I can just get < PROPFIRST > up and going ...... 
Ok , so they changed therapy to OT today .... and holy crap my child is psycho ! After playing hard for over an hour , he is now RUNNING through the house making all kids of noise ! 
Off to bed ... Just to get up to another day of therapy . Does this vicious cycle ever end ? Gotta love being a mom ! 
ST and OT today ... wish < PROPFIRST > luck ! 
Ok so here's my take on life : Life is hard on the weak and harder on the strong . Thank god I have broad shoulders cuz life keeps throwing crap at me ! < PROPFIRST > fell asleep at about 1:30 and was up at 7 .... Holy cow I'm gunna be tired later !!! 
Ok , so even though I am stressed with everything going on , I realize how much progress < PROPFIRST > has made the last year ... and it makes me smile . And Stormie ! OMG she is almost 1 ! Where does the time go ! 
YAY !!! No therapy again til monday , and no school for 2 weeks ! Throw a party !!! 
UVE BEEN HACKED ! I love u mich . <3 ya- < PROPFEMALE > :) 
It's friday !! one more assignment and I'm done til the 4th of < PROPFIRST > ! YAY ! Counting down the days til my girl's first christmas . Although stess is high , today is a good day ! 
Ok , so one more assignment ..... and I'll probably start wrapping presents tonight .... Not looking forward to paraphrasing ! 
YAY ! 2 weeks off ..... what to do , what to do ! Hmmm ...... work ahead maybe ? HA ! NOT ! I think I'll shower and then just relax ... what a concept ! 
Ok so , 2 more days til Christmas ! Hope everyone is ready .... I know I'm not ! < PROPFIRST>'s presents are done , he was easy . But sister ? WHOLE NOTHER STORY ! What do you get for a spoiled 11 month old ??? And for me , All my christmas presents are gunna be late this year . Story of my life ! HURRY UP TO WAIT 
Ok , mother nature is a little confused ! A white CHRISTMAS is what I was hoping for , not Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ! And it isn't even sticking ! GRRRRRR ! 
<3 < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! <3 I know , I am not politically correct ... but does it look like I care ? It's been CHRISTMAS for my 23 years , some hot shots in suits aren't going to tell me otherwise now ! Love yaz ! <3 
<3 PARTY IN MY BED ! That was funny .... 5 bodies , < PROPFEMALE > size bed , fighting babies ..... what a way to start christmas ! <3 
Watching my man sleep , while I wait for the next game of taboo to start .... But first , the bartender is back to work ! Gotta love Christmas ! <3 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas all !! 
Ok , so 4 AM and I realized something . Although things are rough , my life is starting to finally fall into place . This is usually when I bolt , but I'm gettin too old to be scared . And now I have ppl depending on me . So , I'm in it for the long haul and pretty excited about it this time around ! 
It is a miracle ! Both kids up before 9 ! I think I'm gunna need some < PROPMALE > caffeine today ! 
OK so , I'm feelin awesome ! I am only about 1 size bigger than my 14 year old sister !! How awesome is that ! 2 kids and the difference between me and my sister , is the hips ! 
Back to work on school work .. I know I'm a week ahead , but it's better than being a week behind ! BEEN THERE DONE THAT ! Gotta keep pushing til April ! 
It's snowing again ! BRRRRR I hate being cold , but love to sit inside and watch the pretty snowflakes fall . 
Happy new year all ! Anyone wanna share their New years resolutions ? I haven't even thought about mine . Still sad cuz I don't get a New Years kiss ..... And I think I'm missin out cuz I haven't had one since I was 16 ! 
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING . Lets see how honest FB friends are . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me . It can only be 1 word . No more than 1 word . Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This should be interesting ... 
Urgent care here I come ... again ! Ugh ! 
Life is rough .... There has to be a light at the end of the tunnel , but it seems to always be a train ! Am I ever gunna catch a freakin break ?!? 
I am getting ready to wipe my comp b4 I throw it ... If I don't get back on for awhile , it's cuz I did throw it : 0 ) Gotta love technology !!! 
BCS CHAMP GAME IS ON !!! LET'S GO LONGHORNS ! HOOK ' EM HORNS ! BEAT THEM ' BAMA BOYS !!! 
Ok so , school is back on , < PROPFIRST>'s back in therapy 5 days a week , sister is getting over an ear infection and cutting more teeth , < PROPFIRST > has croup AGAIN ... and I have laundry that never seems to end ! 
Ok , so it's 3 AM and < PROPFIRST > can't breathe AGAIN .... WTF am I supposed to do now ? Haul his butt back to the ER so they can tell me again he doesn't have pnuemonia ( which has been confirmed ) it's only croup and he'll \get over it\ " ????? Obviously the steroids aren't working ... " 
Life is short , Break the rules , forgive quickly , kiss slowly , Love truly , Laugh uncontrollably , and never regret anything that made you smile . Life may not be the party we hoped for , but while we're here , we should dance . 
Life is short , Break the rules , forgive quickly , kiss slowly , Love truly , Laugh uncontrollably , and never regret anything that made you smile . Life may not be the party we hoped for , but while we're here , we should dance becuz you never know when the song will end ! 
Give it to me wet N kinky ! 
Ok , it's official ! I HATE DOCTORS ! Being poked and prodded , and told I need testing and blah blah blah is anything but fun ! 
I licked a surfer sliding down a hill because my family thinks im stupid . GO FIGURE !

Both sick babies are asleep ... Gunna try and get some rest before the coughing resumes ! Night ! 
Thank god for nap time ! Gunna bust out some school work while sister's asleep .... 
Waiting for bed time .... kids have a dr's appt in the morning , and then off to therapy . 
OMG it has been a long day ! I'm ready for bed . But , still need to go pick up < PROPFIRST>'s prescription , feed my kids dinner , do baths ... the list never ends ! 
My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease ; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and UNDERSTANDING about what challenges they face ........ 93% of people won't copy and paste this , WILL YOU be one of the 7% that does and make this your status for at least an hour . 
Ok so , whoa ! Picked my < PROPFIRST > up , came home , met everyone ( sighing greatfully because everyone is still alive ) , had dinner just the 2 of us at Risky's , and then , I WENT TO A BAR ! FOR THE FIRST TIME ! It was more than awesome . 
Back to the daily grind . Therapy with < PROPFEMALE > today . And then ...... who knows . My computer is jacked , so not on nearly as much as normal ! 
UGH !!! 
Waiting on < PROPFIRST > to pass out so I can sleep . Thank god sister's already asleep !! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Lima < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Yankee < PROPFIRST > Uniform !!

Ok , yet another trip to the ER ..... Gettin a lil sick of it ! No sleep is wearing me thin , irritated with everything today ... There has to be a better day ! 
Exactly a year ago , I started having serious contractions , and knew my little girl was on her way ! Sad how fast time flies ! 
Happy birthday to my baby girl ! 1 year old today ! She's so big . 
< PROPMALE > from reality , 4 degrees from sanity , inches from integrity , DENIAL IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE ! 
OK , it's been snowing for 4 hours ...... and we have about 4 inches ! IN TX !! No therapy today , CUZ MY CAR'S SNOWED IN !!! LMFAO ! 
It's been snowing for 25 hrs . We are up to 8 1/2 inches , and it's still coming down ..... This is NOT right ! I have places I need to go ! 
Wow what a day ! we cooked SNOW !!! LONG STORY but it was hilarious . 
Finals are turned in , Starting tomorrow , I will be in 2 new classes ! Starting to get burned out , but the block after that , I will hopefully have some choices on my classes . 
Ok , it's official ! I am going to go crazy ! This block of classes is already overwhelming , with 8 assignments due this week alone ! I just hope I can stay sane long enough to get through it . < PROPFIRST > starts school next week , so maybe that will help ! 
When does it all end ? $700 later , the car is broken again . I thoroughly hate the classes I am having to take . Only good news , < PROPFIRST > starts school Monday , and we have rearranged therapy so I only have to drive him up to Denton 3 days a week . Thank goodness sister is so easy ! 
Today's schedule : Breakfast , baths , < PROPMALE > school assignment , and then I have to get things together so that < PROPFIRST > will be ready for school Monday . 
< PROPFIRST > starts school tomorrow ! YAY ! not so yay for the 6 AM wake up tho . Oh well . Maybe I'll get something done while he's at school . Still gotta worry about parts for my car , and getting it to < PROPFIRST > so he can fix it AGAIN . Off to feed , bathe and put kids to bed ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s at school ! YAY ! He should be home around 11 , so we will see how it goes ! 
< PROPFIRST > had a good day , but now I have 2 VERY tired , VERY cranky , VERY dramatic children . Bed time early tonight so he can go back to school tomorrow !! 
< PROPFIRST > did awesome getting on the bus this morning . Hoping for another good day for him . Was gunna try to take a nap since sister was up all night crying , but she is crying again , so guess I'll get off my butt n get something done ! 
Getting ready to put < PROPFIRST > to bed . Sister is already in bed , not quite asleep , and then , I get to work on a Wonderful paper about ethanol for my science class . YAY for crappy classes ! 80 ( 
I think I have pink eye ...... Thankfully , we have drops so I don't have to go to the dr and be seen . I guess there is an upside to every downside . < PROPFIRST > is off to school , so I'm going to lay back down while sister is asleep ! 
Almost bed time for bozo 1 and 2 ! Gotta go through clothes first tho .. UGH ! 
< PROPFIRST > is off to school , and sister is still asleep . Perfect time to work on some school work ! 
I got < PROPFIRST > off to school , but I doubt they will let him stay long . He has a croup cough AGAIN . I can't win with these kids ! 2 weeks in school and he's sick already . And ppl wonder why I can't live a normal life ! 
Happy B-day lil sister . Sry I can't come watch u play but guess that's what I get for being a single mom . Love ya ! Hope u come home with some battle scars ! 
I AM OVER THIS !!! My school is too much , I can't keep things straight , too many phone calls and people to talk to ... I feel like I'm running in circles ! My sleep has been depleted so that isn't helping . UGH ! 
OMG ! both kids are asleep by 9:15 ! Going to take advantage and post my school stuff , and probably crash for the night . NIGHT ! 
OK , so who was the intelligent one that decided to go to the casino the same night we lose an hour for daylight savings ?? DUH ! We had fun though . 
HEY , EVERYONE ! Never doubt for a minute that every single one of you are on my friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I am not only glad to count you as friends but also as family ! Let's see who in my Friend's List actually pays attention . Copy and repost this in your own bulletin if the feeling is mutual ..... 
ALLERGIES and COLDS together suck ! 
Ok , I have made it to week 6 of these classes , but I am struggling ! Haven't even looked to see what my finals look like , so this should be interesting ! 
WOOT ! Gotta love a good rain storm ! Just sux I get stuck bbqing in the rain ! lol 
Why do the little things have to be so freakin hard for this kid ??? I got < PROPFIRST > up for school , and then searched for 30 minutes for shoes ..... He played with them , and lost them , and ended up missing the bus because he can't leave stuff alone !! FRUSTERATING ! 
Went to Winstar , had a blast , played for 4 hrs on $40 , doubled my money twice , and walked away $5 poorer than when I started , but it was awesome ! 
Ugh I hate 6AM ! But < PROPFIRST > is off to school , and thankfully , sister isnt ready to get up quie yet . So , I get a few minutes for school work ! 
HAPPY B-DAY LIL BROTHER !! 
OK , so why is it < PROPFIRST > only has common sense once a month ?? He can't seem to figure it out ! 
If I never have to see an ER again , Id be a happy camper !! Took < PROPFIRST > in yesterday afternoon for an asthma flare up ( O2 lvls were at 89-90 ) and then had to take sister in last night/this morning for a fever of 103 !!! ( turns out she has a buldging ear drum ) 
Ok , so , life is constantly changing .... I have learned it's pointless to plan anything . I was offered a job , VERY part time , 8 hours a week at minimum wage .... it isn't much but it's a start I guess ! 
A hostage in my own house ! These races are gunna kill me . Need to go to the store , but driving 20 < PROPMALE > outta the way to get there is a pain ! 
I went to Winstar last night ( it's a casino about 45 mins from here ) , put my $20 in , and left with $150 ! Go me ! 
Happy b-day to me ! I feel old ! LoL 
< PROPMALE > all for the birthday wishes ! 
OMG ..... so , we had 2 baby birds living in one of our vents , that took 2 hours to get out . Once we got them out , one took off but the second one can't fly ! We put the bird in a box in the garage , and my son that is deathly affraid of birds unsuspectingly open the box and just about had a heart attack . HILARIOUS ! 
Omg i hate downtown traffic !!! 
Ok , so took < PROPFIRST > to see the eye dr this morning ..... Got some good and bad news . His eyes aren't getting any better , but they aren't getting worse . Dr said he will probably never need glasses which is awesome !! But , he does need surgery to adjust the muscles around his eyes . Oh well , one more thing to do I guess ! 
Ugh ! Not only do we have to do eye surgery for < PROPFIRST > , but we also get to do tubes for sister , and a new set of tubes for < PROPFIRST > . Gotta love surgery : 0P 
My baby is growing up so fast .... She's playin in the mud already ! Gotta love the dog's water bucket , and a bunch of dirt ! Cheap thrills . 
Happy Mothers day to all the great ones ! 
My son is watching ** GASP ** < PROPMALE > ! But he's content LoL 
Ok , so how much more stuff can these two boogers get into ?!?! I am going to admit myself to a nut house if they continue ! 
\For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'\ 
Took the kids swimming , ate pizza for dinner .... now we are making SMORES !! awesome night ! 
Hopefully , this kid will pass out soon ! I have to be up and be at work at 8:45 in the morning , and he's being dumb . 
Whoa . Got my schedule and they have me working A LOT ! Like 30 hrs a week ! It's awesome , but I was hoping to move most the stuff to the house and get that situated ! Oh well , all things come with time ! Just means I should have some extra money for all the little things I need to live comfortable , along with some of the big things I will have to invest in . 
Ok , so second day on the job , and it's going pretty well . I'm scheduled to work tomorrow for a few hours , but I'm going to spend the rest of the day out at the house trying to put stuff where it goes . Hopefully we will be totally in by this next weekend . Cross ur fingers ! 
Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > wright ! Welcome to the madhouse we call life . Congrats < PROPMALE > n < PROPFEMALE > we love u guys ! 
Congrats to all the Northwest Grads , but especially < PROPFIRST > n < PROPFEMALE > ! U guys finally made it ! Now on to the next chapter ! O by the way , reality is a beach that's not always < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Busy , busy ! Stormie made it through surgery just fine , but < PROPFIRST>'s was rescheduled : 0P O well ! Trying to keep up with school , working 30+ hours a week , dealing with kids and living life is keeping me on my toes . Sry to all that I haven't gotten a < PROPMALE > to talk to the past couple days ! I still love u ! <3 Mwah ! 
Fact of life ... After Monday & Tuesday , even the calendar says W T F !! 
Well , memories , they're over-rated :\ 
All they do is get you down an ' frustrated , \ 
And who needs that on their back ? \ 
Starting over , cold turkey , \ 
Washin ' your soul of everything that's dirty . \ 
Seal your heart of every crack 
How are you gonna fall if you don't take that leap\ 
You live in fear , fear of lovin ' me\ 
And I'm givin ' up , I'm givin ' up on you\ 
Because you'll never change and\ 
Givin ' your heart away is one thing you won't do 
is confused ... I'm not sure why I'm confused but i am confused about being confused ... and that makes me more confused ... is that confusing or what ? 
Thank god for days off , and good mornings with my boogers ! Took the kids outside this morning and had a picnic on their picnic table , ( gotta love lunchables ! lol ) thought about doing bubbles n stuff with um outside , but stormie doesn't like the stickers : 0P I think I'm gunna make a trip to the store and buy WASHABLE finger paint and do inside stuff with them til it's cool enough to mow ( again , some more ) 
The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible 
Don't allow others to drive you crazy , when you know it's within walking distance ! 
Don't want to read the paper or turn on the news\ 
Don't want another helpin ' of the same old blues\ 
Don't want to call nobody or answer the phone\ 
What I want is everybody to leave us alone\ 
Let us sit down in the porch swing sip a little ice tea\ 
Play with the kids in the yard\ 
It's time to get lazy had enough crazy\ 
Life ain't gotta be so hard 
Hold your head high . \ 
Don't ever let ' em define\ 
The light in your eyes . \ 
Love yourself , give them Hell . \ 
You can take on this world . \ 
You just stand and be strong\ 
And then fight\ 
Like a girl . \ 
Oh , with style and grace\ 
Kick ass and take names 
You say I’m nothing you can’t handle\ 
You’re tougher than an anvil\ 
Well baby we’ll see\ 
I’m like a wrecking ball coming\ 
You’re better off running\ 
Far away from me\ 
Don’t get me wrong now baby I adore ya\ 
It’s only right that I give you fair warning\ 
Cuz I break things ! 
Please keep this little man in your thoughts and prayers . His family is in great need of < PROPFEMALE > , understanding , and a few dry shoulders to cry on in their time of need ! 
< PROPFEMALE > has lost the fight for life this morning . Please keep the family in your thoughts and prayers as they learn to cope with this horrible hand they were dealt . March 2006-June 2010

And I'll be coming back real soon to longhorns saloon\ 
So < PROPFIRST > can pour me a beer\ 
The stockyards its my backyard that's where I grew up 
I'm stuck in a vicious cycle of mommyhood . Kids are on a feeding frenzy , which means plenty of diapers to change , baths to give , clothes to wash ... There is not enough time in the day ! I still have to start my final that's due next week ! UGH ! Thank god I'm almost done with this class . Not sure how the next block is gunna work , since it's a history class and a healthcare class . Talk about a full freakin load ! 
Hi Ho Hi Ho , it's off to work I go ! Kinda glad for a long day at work , means I get a lunch , and that's when I'll work on my final . No kids tonight since I have to be back again tomorrow early . 5 days til < PROPFIRST>'s surgery ! fingers crossed it goes well . 
Woot ! Off work , headed to lay down once i move < PROPFEMALE > over , The 3 days off ! Gotta love it . Mowing and movie planned for tomorrow . If the weather stays nice , we may even go swimming ! 
Ok , what the hell ! I was trying to mow , then the sky decided to turn nasty colors , and now , it's POURING ! There goes that idea . And no swimming , unless we swim in the raindrops ! So dumb ..... I get to spend my day off inside : 0 ( 
< PROPFIRST > has surgery in the morning ... : 0 ( Hopefully he will be back up and going quickly tho ! Then it's back to work on Friday . Final is due Sunday and then I'm officially half way done with my Associates ! WOOT ! 
UPDATE : < PROPFIRST > is fine , so far so good . He's been sleeping since surgery , so not sure if his eyes bother him yet . I made it home and since both kids are passed out and < PROPFEMALE>'s here , I'm going to finish my mow job that got rained out the other day , then headed to moms . Gotta love family being so close in times like this !! LOVE YOU GUYS ! 
Left Stormie with mom and < PROPFEMALE > for the night , < PROPFIRST > is here at home with me , sleeping off the anesthesia , in a quiet dark house . Poor baby ! Gotta do meds and eye drops , and he will be set for another 4 hours . 
Last night was nothing but crap ! After an hour of fighting with a blind boy , I finally got his meds down . He ate a cracker , a couple spongebob fruit snacks , had some juice and water , and then laid back down on the living room floor . At 2 , I finally fell asleep , only to be woken up at 4 by < PROPFIRST > running into the walls , saying \I hot . outside ? \"" 
Noone to answer to , \ 
No one that's gunna argue , \ 
And since I got that hold off me , \ 
I'm livin life now that I'm free . \ 
\ 
Told me to get my shit together , \ 
Now I've got my shit together . \ 
Now I made it through the weather , \ 
Better days are gunna get better . 
It's not how hard you fall , it's how high you bounce back ! 
Final is done and turned in , now lets just hope it's enough to get me out of that class ! I REALLY don't wanna have to take it again . I start History from 1865-1945 and The language of Healthcare classes in about an hour , and not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing ! I really wanna get my associates , but man o man it's a lot of stress trying to keep up with everything especially by my self ! 
Second chances ? um no .. I am thru with giving people the benefit of the doubt . From now on I will give them the benefit of go f*ck yourself ! 
I've already fallen\ 
I've already lost control\ 
I've already missed\ 
And I've already sold my soul\ 
And I've already cried\ 
And I wish that I was flyin'\ 
But I'll keep on fallin ' 
People are as useful as white crayons ! 
Thinks gun control means being able to hit your target ! 
Wake me up ! Bid my blood to run . I can't wake up ! Before I come undone , Save me ! Save me from the nothing I've become ! 
And I've already cried ... \ 
Lost the directions to my happy place ! 
Movie night with my sister ! First up : Bounty < PROPMALE > ! 
I would really like to pelt someone with skittles and tell them to TASTE THE FREAKIN RAINBOW ! 
shes as free as the blue bonnets in the summer\ 
shes as hot as the Padre island sun\ 
most of the times shes as warm and friendly \ 
like the hills that surround Austin\ 
shes as bright as the < PROPFIRST > Sky \ 
she always holds head high \ 
she loves the company of her family\ 
she has faith in God's greater plan\ 
she trusts im a good man\ 
and thats why i'll always believe \ 
shes like TEXAS and she likes me 
I pray you enough sun to keep your attitude bright no matter how gray the day may appear , \ 
Enough rain to appreciate the sun even more\ 
Enough happiness to keep your spirit alive and everlasting\ 
Enough pain so that even the smallest of joys in life may appear bigger\ 
Enough gain to satisfy your wanting\ 
Enough loss to appreciate all that you possess\ 
Enough hellos to get you through the final goodbye 
Stormie , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and I are in heaven ! Watched UP this morning , now I'm watching the kids eat \kids\ " cones at DQ : -) " 
Children ?? I'm sorry , you must be mistaken , I don't have children , I have little hurricanes , that leave nothing but demolition and destruction behind them ! 
When most people wake up from a nightmare to reality , they usually feel better . My reality is worse than any nightmare could ever be !! Please just let me go back to my nightmare so I don't have to deal with my reality . 
Computer took a dump , on it's way to get fixed . I'll be MIA for awhile . No worries tho ! I still have my phone ! 
Grrr ... 103 and raining means its hot and sticky as hell ! SOOO NOT helping my \already in a bad mood\ " mood ! " 
When most people wake up from a nightmare to reality , they usually feel better . My reality is worse than any nightmare could ever be !! Please just let me go back to my nightmare so I don't have to deal with my reality : 0 ( 
Ok , there HAS to be a light at the end of the tunnel that isn't a train ! Phone's messin up , Computer is still broken , and now , car is totally dead . Will my nightmare ever end ? I'm thinking I will end up in the looney bin before it does ! 
It's hard when you always have to be the strong one , n o-o ne ever notices when your not ok ... 
But trust me I’m an accident waiting here to happen\ 
Cause I break things\ 
Anything I touch\ 
I just get around and then I’m bound to tear ‘em up\ 
Yeah , I make things\ 
Snap and fall apart 
ok , I need a favor ! Does anyone have Microsoft office ? I have some files for school I need opened and then changed to something like wordpad so I can print them .... Anyone able to help ?? 
I officially feel a little better ... The wonders of getting a little dirty to relieve stress ! still trying to figure out how to get my school stuff so i can use moms comp to print it all out , fix my car , waiting on my computer to be fixed , not even gunna start on the lawn mower yet !! 
... Snap and fall apart 
This should be interesting ! They have me working 32 hours , which is nice . < PROPFIRST > starts school on the 23 , Open house for him is Thursday . I need to just get a new car I'm thinking : 0 ( School is supposed to start again for me the 23 too . HOPEFULLY my computer will be fixed , and back up and running by then ! 
So sick of damn immigrants !! 
< PROPFIRST > starts school in the morning , and I don't . Computer still isnt fixed : 0 ( Car ... ya lost cause ! Still dunno what to do about that whole mess ! UGH ! 
I'M OVER IT ! 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They all want what we all want - to be accepted . Most of you probably wont copy-paste this to your wall . But will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Its Special Education Week !! 
Holy crap ! Someone forgot to tell < PROPFIRST > its the weekend ! He climbed in bed with me at 5:30 ready to play . HELLO ! I don't work til 10:30 ! I don't wanna be up yet ! 
How is it that someone that you claim to love , whether it be as a friend or otherwise , can become the target of lies , cheating , kniving , and even theft , and you don't even think it is an issue ? Just a thought to ponder on ..... 
I need a timeout from being an adult ! 
My damn car is gunna kill me !! 450 for tires plus 60 for an alignment . There goes my paycheck and then some ! 
I am thankful for the people I have in my life . My car is up and running , and even though I paid a lot , it's good to go . Thankfully it WASN'T the heads . A thermostat , tires and alignment and it's good . I am borrowing a laptop from an awesome friend so I can stay in school , and another 2 friends helped me fix the mower . Gotta love the people I have in my life ! 
My new nickname is grace . I feel like an idiot ! 
Even though I barely have enough time in the day to breathe , it feels good to be back in school . Need to get my butt in gear and get Stormie into Early head start so I can work during the day too . Talk about a full life ! 
I'm starting to feel like I live in the middle of a lake ...... In love the rain and all , but I think we've had enough for a minute . Mr storm , could you please hold on for just a minute before you dump another couple inches on my head ? 
Ok , so I'm a lil stuck . I need help making some sentences for an assignment . Anyone wanna help ?!? Here's the words ..... Intervertebral , Periosteal , Ossification , Brachioradialis , Neuromuscular , Subarachnoid . 
Ok , my poor brain is about to explode with all this medical garbage . still have several words I need sentences for , and possibly some help with research for history . Anyone game ?? 
it hurts but I never show , \ 
this pain you’ll never know\ 
if only you can see just how lonely and how cold\ 
and frostbit i’ve become\ 
my back’s against the wall\ 
when push come to shove\ 
i just stand up and scream f*ck em all 
If I die young bury me in satin \ 
Lay me down on a bed of roses\ 
Sink me in the river at dawn\ 
Send me away with the words of a love song 
Use me as you will\ 
Pull my strings just for a thrill\ 
And I know I'll be ok\ 
Though my skies are turning gray ! 
OMG I hate being sick !! 
needs to call the zoo and tell them to come get their beasts ! i swear i have a porcupine in my throat , a woodpecker in my head , and an elephant on my chest !! 
Verdict is in ! The elephant on my chest is bronchitis , the porcupine in my throat is strep , and the woodpecker in my head is sinusitis and a double ear infection . GO FIGURE ! If you're gunna get sick , get it all the way ! 
Wish I could kick this crap I have ! Meds aren't helping . Gotta work tonight , and hopefully I can make it through ! 
Life is really simple ; we ourselves create the circumstances that complicate it 
Cops need to get lives . Little town cops especially ! If I ain't doin nothin wrong leave me the fuck alone don't make up bullshit excuses for pullin me over ! 
Someday , money won't be an issue , happiness will never be questioned and secret tears will not be shed . Until then , its back to the daily grind . 
This too shall pass . AMOR FATI . Although life is a constant challenge , I am starting to learn to just take everything in stride . 
fuera < PROPMALE > trabajo . va a conseguir comida con mi hermana ! 
And I just can't keep living this way\ 
So starting today , I'm breaking out of this cage\ 
I'm standing up , Imma face my demons\ 
I'm manning up , Imma hold my ground\ 
I've had enough , now I'm so fed up\ 
... Time to put my life back together right now 
Feeling very accomplished , even though the house is a wreck , and the laundry isn't done . Whatever ! I even had a moment with < PROPFIRST > today ! I made lunch , put Stormie to bed after she ate , walked back in the kitchen where < PROPFIRST > was eating , and he said \MOMMY ! a hug ?! \ " LOVE IT ! " 
... when push come to shove\ 
I ain't really happy\ 
Unless the sky starts driving rain\ 
Maybe I just get off on the pain\ 
My whole life I been pickin fights\ 
There ain't no way to win\ 
There's a hundred scars and shoulda-run-aways\ 
Now tattooed on my skin\ 
There's a side of me that just won't stop\ 
Dancin in the flame\ 
Maybe I just get off on the pain 
Kids , a shower , school , a load of laundry , a few dishes ..... Now it's get ready to go to work , and then do it all again ! It's finals week , so I better get my butt in gear NOW cuz my history final is what's gunna decide if I retake the whole damn class . I already have to retake the HCA 220 class : 0 ( 
I am really hoping that this weird feeling I have is just due to my final . I think there's more to it , but I'm not about to dwell on it right now ! Big presentation due on Sunday , so there goes my days off this week . 
If you have a wonderful man who is your whole world . Who isn't perfect but is perfect for you , who works hard and who would do anything for you , makes you laugh .. who is your best friend(and sometimes your only ) . Who you want to grow old with ( if you don't kill him first ) and you are thankful for everyday then re-post this ....? HE'S MY SON !! 
What r the freakin odds ! Concussion scare with stormie and Codys was less than a month ago ! I can't keep missing wrk like this\ " , 2010-10-30 22:25:36 " 
Happy Halloween all ! I got to take my babies trick or treating . It was fun ! Gma took pics so I'll post pics in a few ! 
God < PROPMALE > me the\ 
Serenity to accept the things I cannot change\ 
Courage to change the things I can\ 
Wisdom to know the difference\ 
< PROPFEMALE > for the things that take time\ 
Appreciation for all that I have\ 
Tolerance for those with different struggles\ 
Strength to get back up and try again\ 
Even when I feel hopeless 
I am thankful for : Getting woken up at 8 AM by a little boy that wanted to spend time with his mommy !! Had breakfast and hot chocolate with < PROPFIRST > , Put kids in the car , and came to moms . Now , it's make food n watch football !!! Happy Turkey Day ! 
Ive got some issues that nobody can see\ 
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me\ 
I bring them to the light for you\ 
It's only right\ 
This is the soundtrack to my life , the soundtrack to my life 
Will it ever freakin end ? How many low blows can one take before they just wanna stay down ? I think I've hit that point : 0 ( 
In 4 days , my lil man will be one year older . Man o man how the time has flown ! We've been through a lot in the past couple years , but it's amazing to see how far he's come . LOVE U LIL MAN ! 
Exactly 6 years ago , I was officially in labor with the one person that changed my very being . I didn't know it at the time , but my view on life was about to completely change . I now realize how important the little things are ! ILY lil man !! Happy b-day < PROPFIRST > BUG ! 
My lil man is getting so big , so fast . I got the kids up this morning n made eggs for breakfast , and < PROPFIRST > ( who usually calls it dip ) asked for keCHUP . LoL it was funny ! Happy b-day bug ! 
Ok . WHAT A MORNING !! < PROPFIRST > woke up gagging , ate a piece of toast , layed down on the foot of my bed and passed out . Stormie was acting just fine , layed next to me in my bed while I was doing school stuff , then THREW UP all over me , her , the bed .... UGH ! 
Ok , so much for a 24 hour flu bug ! The throwing up isn't fun , but a lot less stinky than the poops ! BOTH kids stink to high heaven . I even woke up with a stomach ache this morning . UGH ! 
I think I have what my kids had ... I feel like I need to throw up , but it's almost like it's stuck . What a yucky feeling ! 
Y is it that when I'm the sickest , everyone wants my attention ? I just don't have the energy ! Throwing up kinda drains u , duh ! 
I officially got summoned today . Y is it I can't catch a break !?! I just want to give up n let every1 that's telling me how to do this , do it for me . 
Grrr . Woke up to get ready for work n have been dealing with bodily fluids ever since . Is it wrong to just want the kids to sit in the bath all day ? Makes for easier clean up : 0P 
< PROPMALE > mom n < PROPFEMALE > ! Gotta love helpful family when u n ur babies feel like crap . Now my house doesn't smell like sickness n I have bread n ramen n sprite ! 
Omw to the doctor . Stormie has a fever for the second day . The throw ups r bad , but the fever scares me . 
Ugh ! Y is it when I have nothing to do , my kids wanna get up at the buttcrack of < PROPFEMALE > ?! 6:30 came WAY too early . Thanks a bunch stormie lol 
Christmas is going to be good this year . Just spending time with family and friends and my babies is going to be good ! 
XBox Kinect is awesome !! How many drunk adults can play n not fall ??? WE SHALL SEE ! 
The < PROPFEMALE > is on moms feet , the south pole is on our couch , Saturn is on jordans butt , the north pole is on the fan blade . Whoa lmfao 
I'm completely torn . < PROPFIRST > wants me to lay here with him , but I have a house that needs some < PROPMALE > cleaning ! I guess I'm not gunna accomplish much today , bcuz my baby comes first ! 
I feel accomplished . Car reg is paid , water < PROPMALE > is paid , paid mom for the phone . We r set for a minute ! 
< PROPFIRST > still has a fever , green drainage from his ears , a nasty snotty nose n he's tired . I have no energy , a fever of 101 , the body aches ... does this vicious cycle ever end ?!? I've slept since I got home at 2 . Grrrrrrrr ! 
Ok , being that I don't feel good , my < PROPFEMALE > is non existent . Sitting in a Drs waiting room watching a mom put MORE makeup on while her kids push stormie around ? I THINK NOT ! If she spoke freakin English I'd tell her to watch her brats ! Instead , I'll just encourage stormie to hit them back when they kick her in the face ! 
Verdict is in . I swear I can't catch a break to save my life ! I have the start of strep and the flu . Now I know y I haven't wanted to get outta bed ! 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > for staying awake til 8 this morning and stormie for getting up at 8 . I need sleep to kick this flu cuz I'm having a hard time moving thanks to the body aches . Plz o plz tell me it's nap time ! 
And life goes on . Court went ok for the most part but I'm sick of ppl telling me I'm wrong . If I really am wrong , help me fix it n let's move on ! If ur just saying it bcuz u think ur way is better , get ready for an earfull ! 
So , I got ready for bed by candle light , n now I have 2 scardy dogs under the covers in my bed . I think the storm is here lol 
Ok , so I thought I was a cashier until today . Since when do cashiers pull carts and work produce ? Lol not complaining cuz I stayed busy just pondering a thought . 
Man o man my kids r nuts . They totally emptied stormies dresser , now they are rearranging the clothes n put things back . Glad I don't really care that it takes 10 minutes to find her a pair of sweats ! Lol 
Ok , I REALLY wish I spoke stormieaneese ! WTF is \guyguyguy noonle ? noonle ? \ " LMAO wow . " 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people FAT . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! ( Re posted from another friend's status message . Feel free to do the same . ) 
Plz keep < PROPFEMALE > in ur prayers . Although I do not know details , I do know that she was ill yesterday . May she be stronger and back on her feet soon ! 
Ok really !?! Love my kid but omg ! Didn't get to sleep til 3 after everything was done . < PROPFIRST > decided he wanted to wake me up at 5 to tell me he wanted \water and eat\ " . Ugh it's gunna be a long freakin day !! " 
Playing with horses with lil man !! 
< PROPFIRST > did amazing today thanks to a helping hand . There r still good ppl in this world , just gotta have < PROPFEMALE > to find um I guess . Luckily , I am learning < PROPFEMALE > . Hopefully sooner than later I can go back up there ! 
Sometimes you need to fall apart in order to be put back together stronger ! 
Hates it when she's mid-sentence and her brain does that etch-a-sketch thing and < tch tch > everything gets erased !! 
I'm as confused as a chameleon in a room full of skittles ! 
Hates weekends . Getting off late and having to work early suxx ! Hi ho , hi ho , it's back to work I go ! 
I am realizing that we may be having a mental regression in my house again . Somethings < PROPFIRST > is retaining , but some areas are starting to go downhill again . Just means I need to put my game face on n get back to work ! Going to get ahold of all codys specialists tomorrow n make sure they will take his new insurance before his appts . 
Knees in the back , elbows to the side of the head , snoring in my ear .... I'm a lucky mommy ! Lil man wanted to sleep next to me ! :-) 
Made a wrong turn , once or twice\ 
Dug my way out , blood and fire\ 
Bad decisions , that's alright\ 
Welcome to my silly life\ 
Mistreated , misplaced , misunderstood\ 
Miss ' No way , it's all good ' , it didn't slow me down\ 
Mistaken , always second guessing , underestimated\ 
Look , I'm still around 
Woot ! Finally a medical appt for lil mans eyes ! Going the 7th to possibly set another surgery . Waiting for his endo to return my call to find out when we need to do the blood work for that . Hopefully his tsh levels r under 5 this go round ! Ent appts for both kids r in april tho :-( one step at a time I guess ! 
Thank god for camel backs ! LOL ! Thanks to 2 special ppl last night for the laughs . 
Saw him coming from the upstairs room\ 
His headlights shined like the moon\ 
I smile\ 
He never makes me wait\ 
Twelve roses like the clock reads noon\ 
This < PROPFEMALE > dances to the tune\ 
Oh while\ 
There's no time to waste\ 
So can we just slow down\ 
While you make this mistake\ 
Just slow down\ 
So my heart don't break 
On your knees you look up , Decide what you're made of . You get mad you get strong , wipe your hands shake it off THEN U STAND ! 
Having a black sheep party :-) 
Back to being a chameleon in a bag of skittles , but I am content in so many ways ! 
< PROPFIRST > hood was a thief , < PROPFIRST > got high off mushrooms , Snow white lived with 7 men , Sleeping beauty always slept in , and our parents wonder why we are so bad !! 
The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible . I think I am testing what I believe to be impossible , so we shall see how things turn out ! 
Dear pain , oh , it's been a long time\ 
Remember when you were holding me tight\ 
I would stay awake with you all night\ 
Dear shame , I was safe in your arms\ 
You were there when it all fell apart\ 
I would get so lost in your beautiful lies\ 
I let you go\ 
But you're still chasing\ 
Go ahead\ 
You're never gonna take me\ 
You can bend\ 
But you're never gonna break me\ 
I was yours\ 
I'm not yours anymore\ 
Oh , you don't own me 
Never blame any day in your life , good days give you happiness , bad days give you experience , and the worst days give you a lesson .. 
I'm officially slick ! And no , I don't know how to drive on ice . < PROPMALE > 
No freakin water , but there's plenty if snow on the ground ... o wait that's ice . Grrrr . At least we have power , but I doubt I'm gunna be able to go anywhere any time soon since I OBVIOUSLY dunno how to drive on ice . My car needs skates lol . 
Nope , I'm not stuck in a ditch ! My car wanted to make snow angels on the way to the store . So , that should explain why my car was in a ditch 
2 years . It's already been 2 years since I had my little girl . Time has flown n dragged by at the same time . I'm starting to realize my mothers pain , since miss Stormie is just like me . 
Wish I could do something for stormies bday , but it'll have to wait . I think I'll just take a nap when she lays down for her nap . I'm ready to be able to go back to work dangit ! 
6 inches of snow ... I have no driveway ! Ugh stuck for another day ... 
Wow this is kinda crappy . Haven't had running water since Monday night/Tuesday morning . It would be different if I were stuck home n could do the laundry n dishes that are accumulating so quickly . Instead , I'm watching Elmo ...... again 
I'm looking forward to a nice hot bath tonight ! I'll never take advantage of hot running water again ! As soon as I realized my water was unfrozen , u better believe I went straight for the shower , I didn't pass go or collect $200 ! Cheap thrills lol 
It's my favorite time of day\ 
Barely awake\ 
Yet but burning with life\ 
And love , I'm so in love\ 
Holding my breath\ 
Just give me one more night\ 
And one more night is all I ask\ 
And one more night after that 
Let's go steelers ! Send the pack packin !! 
Too much to do , to little time . But , I'm starting to make time for things I love so it's a start ! 
After a hurricane comes a rainbow ! Had my hurricane last night , now it's my time to shine ! 
Just did lunch with my dad . Was a little emotional at the end , but I feel better . My fears about him n < PROPFIRST > were dealt with , n he actually seems like he understands finally . 
Anyone wanna steal my kids for a day ?? I need to majorly clean my house . 6 days of kids constantly trapped in the house n I'm going nuts !! 
Always remember that for every storm , a rainbow awaits ... 
If everything is under control , ur going too slow ! 
The snow is here ! Cold front has hit decatur , so within the hour its gunna drop another ten degrees if not more here ! Ugh for winter time ! 
You know the weather is bad when u check it , and it tells u \13 feels like -6\ " WTF ! That should be illegal in tx dammit ! " 
I licked a surfer sliding down a hill cuz my family thinks I'm stupid . And yes , I really have an orange shirt on lol 
note to self ... you cannot depend on mother nature , she is bipolar ! 
Slick , squirt , bug , sister , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and beaux FTW 
I ain't the kind you take home to mama\ 
I ain't the kind to wear no ring\ 
Somehow I always get stronger\ 
When I'm on my second drink\ 
Even though I hate to admit it\ 
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes\ 
Christian folks say I should quit it\ 
I just smile and say , \God bless \"" 
Next block for school is officially under way ! And of course since I'm awake , I was already snooping around to see what's what ! I guess I'll take advantage of everyone being sick again and bust out some school work tomorrow . Glad it's finally a class I enjoy ! I'm a little tired of medical garbage ! On to some math ! 
Ugh . Poor < PROPFIRST > ! Croup and a sinus infection on top of allergies . This weather is killin us ! Thy say stormies is just allergies but I have to watch for signs of sinus infection . What a mess ! 
Trust is a funny thing , \ 
never know what it can bring , \ 
but it sure can cause you pain . \ 
I’ve been hurt a time or two , \ 
baby I know so have you\ 
so lets put the past away . \ 
And give this everything we've got\ 
Baby I’ll trust you in the night\ 
When we’re both wrong , nobody’s right . \ 
Let’s agree to disagree . \ 
Let’s go slow , let’s go fast , \ 
let’s just make sure we last . \ 
And if you will I will too , \ 
baby I’ll trust you . 
can't really say what's on her mind right now but just know that her gears are being grinded and they are now starting to smoke . 
This is for u Linny ! \ here I go again on my own ! \ " bahahahaha hopefully u got a visual ! " 
Lots of thoughts swimming around in my head but the < PROPMALE > one : why the hell am I awake at 4am ?!?! Good question .... body would you like to answer ? 
Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > , wherever you may be . You light my night with your midnight sun . 
Every time I see you , my middle finger gets a boner : 0 ) 
It's been a VERY long day . My pillows calling my name !! 
Ok , so I got off facebook 8 hrs ago . And , I've been awake for about an hour . I'm back to not sleeping again ! UGH !! I guess I'll just start my day WAY early today and hope noone minds that I'm dragging by 5 ! 
Don't mistake kindness for weakness nor silence for stupidity ... I keep my distance not out of fear or bitterness but because of contentment . I'm HAPPY where I am ! 
All electronics WILL be turned off tonight ! About to start cooking dinner now , and won't be back til after it's done !! It's family night cuz my kids need some serious me time ! 
Ok , so all my electronics are being shut off as of now ! Dinner is started so I'm going to read a cookbook with the kids til we figure out what to make for dessert ! Have a good night all ! 
Homebound .......... finally !! 
I'd rather know and be disappointed , then not know and always wonder . 
Yogurt story with my little bro today . I'm glad we had a few to catch up ! Been missin him ! Now I'm home with my babies gettin ready for some much needed sleep ! 
The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible . 
Four things that can never be recovered : The stone after it's thrown , the word after it's spoken , the occasion after it's missed , and the time after it's gone . 
silence is golden ... duct tape is silver ... an old shovel is bronze ... take your pick 
Ugh ! My kids hinder so much . Need to figure something else out cuz this blows 
Biscuits n gravy with my babies at noon in our jammies ! Life is good . Only argument was over who wanted more first . Throw another biscuit in the situation and everything was fine again ! Hopefully the day stays good . 
Hi ho , hi ho , it's off to work I go ! Looking forward to a day off soon tho ! 
It's official ! I start working overnights on Saturday ! 
If u see me and I have a confused look on my face , it's cuz ur looking at me n I'm not quite sure y ! Stop looking at me so I can go back to my own little world plz !

I've already missed \ 
And I wish that I was flying ..... \ 
But I keep on falling 
Clocking in to start yet another long night . So much on my mind , hopefully it'll help me stay awake ! 
I hear my bed calling my name !! I'm going to give my pillow some head n my bed some booty as soon as I make it home ! 
Ugh . Im not sure I can keep doing this . It blows ! 
Marys balls and rice for dinner ..... was hoping to make cookies with the kids b4 bed but I realized they won't get done in time :-(
