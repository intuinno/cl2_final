The genius of modern film making , a series of pictures and statements that can cause you to feel , cause you to love , and even to lose . It is in this aspect that one can lose touch with reality ; it's brilliance that is defined by individuals , not by events . 
So I used to have this piggy bank , and the thing that stands out most to me was its smile . If you put in a dollar the piggy bank had this smile like it was happy , the same thing happened whether it was a dime , nickel , or < PROPFEMALE > ; Ironicially however the piggy bank would smile just as happily when you put in no money at all . Come to think of it ... people could learn a lot from that piggy bank of mine .

Ahh , you know what ? I think i'm finally happy . Chasing women and parties and money was a defining aspect of my life , but I was just a little kid . I'm done chasing juvenile thrills and lifestyles . All I'm looking forward to now is being able to settle down with my family that's what life is really about ; spending it with the people that will always care no matter what . 
Not even there yet and I already have a job and a car . lol . Ohio you really are a terrible place to live .

Little kids need to grow up and let their pathetic lives not spread onto other people . 
Life is good , peaceful , serene , and relaxing . The only thing I miss about Ohio are my girls and they'll be here with me soon enough . 
Game notifications are taking over my profile . Where mah ninja sword at ?

They say you can't have your cake and eat it too , If this is true why not punch somebody in the face and eat their cake .... after all they can't just have their cake and eat it too .

Not to dis Radiohead but the next person to compare their talent to MUSE is getting slapped with an unfortunate member of my anatomy . 
Just finished learning Frenado Sor's rendition of Adagio for strings . Beautiful piece . 
Everything in life is better with a sweater vest ! xD 
< PROPFEMALE > Freaking Christmas , I hope everyone has a wonderful day . 
Strangely good Christmas , played guitar and listened to Muse , went rabbit hunting , watched Little Fockers , and topped it off with prime rib . It's different , but it was fun . 
Tru Blood . Nuff said . 
Who wants to do something ? Perhaps jam ? 
It's one thing to be pathetic enough to lie about hooking up with somebody , but to be so desperate for attention that you'll lie about hooking up with someone whose fiancee will knock your fucking teeth out . You'll have to let facebook know how that works out for you faggot .
