I've always thought \ 
that I would love to live by the sea \ 
To travel the world alone \ 
and live my life more simply \ 
I have no idea what's happened to that dream \ 
Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me \ 
It's just a thought , only a thought \ 
But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy \ 
Well I deserve nothing more than I get \ 
Cos nothing I have is truly mine 
Happy Chinese New Year to all my friends on both sides of the pond !
