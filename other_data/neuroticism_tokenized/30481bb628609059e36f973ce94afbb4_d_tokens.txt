FML !!! football is my life , the ball is my baby , the end zone is my house , so you can get the **** out 
Being perfect is about being able to look your friends in the eye and know that you didnt let them down because you told them the truth . And that truth is you did everything you could . There wasnt one more thing you could've done . Can you live in that moment as best you can , with clear eyes , and love in your heart , with joy in your heart ? If you can do that- you're perfect ! 
just was invited to a football camp at the university of Cincinnati !!! 
you've got nothin to lose dont be afraid to get down .

SPRING BREAK BOYYYYY !!!!

Do things to the best of your ability , because what s done is done and you can't change the results ; you can only look forward and do your best to succeed next time ... failure is the key to success .. correcting your failures and mistakes is the door that opens the pathway to strive for exellance to become successfull ..... haha !! im such a deep thinker ... :) 
LOL .... I LOVE FOOTBALL !!!... :) 
6 k's vs < PROPFEMALE > Center , not a bad game i'd say ... but A B.S. call 
Faith is not necessary when you know how things are going to work out , - that's knowledge 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails . —I Corinthians 13:4 -8

But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a roar ; the elements will be destroyed by fire , and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare . 2 < PROPFIRST > 3:10

Try to find out what you're good at , and have a passion for , and get someone to pay you for doing it because If you never act , you can never improve and become successful . 
Hates when people say that they aren't happy : or they are pissed off .... that is BS because i think that you are that way because you choose to be . instead ; they let others choose for them ..... Our society these days is so f'ing screwed up .. 
Uncertainty is caused by a lack of knowledge . Hesitation is the product of fear . my opinion is you can't live in fear ..... 
SWEETNESS !!!

Always be the hammer , not the nail ! Deliver the blow , do not accept punishment . :) 
The difference between a cocky and confident person is that cocky people are more subtle and questioning their own ability & more of a attitude thing . While confident people are more quiet and know how to distinguish the things they can do to the things they can'tt do , it's a mind set 
Dwane < PROPMALE > and Lebron < PROPFIRST > ?!?!!! that's bettet than Shaq and Kobe . 
You can't live in fear ......

It doesn't matter how many say it cannot be done or how many people have tried it before ; it's important to realize that whatever you're doing , it's your first attempt at it , and with God nothing is impossible . 
When one door closes another door opens ; but we often look so long and so regretfully on the closed door , that we don't see the ones that open for us ... 
I mustache you a question but I will shave it for later ... hahaha :D 
Many people will walk in and out of your life , but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart .

life is like football , because where you put your time and effort is what you will get out of it , 
When you look , you see reflections of your being . When you listen , you hear echoes of yourself . If you don't like something about what you see and hear , no point in smashing the mirror , change who you are becoming . 
1 of the greatest pleasures in life is doing what people say you cannot do . 
Let's have a toast for the douchebags , Let's have a toast for the assholes .... :)
