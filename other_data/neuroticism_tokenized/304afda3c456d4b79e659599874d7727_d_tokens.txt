I love breakfast foods . 
Goodnight , < PROPFEMALE > . I've always hated that book . 
I saw Nanny McPhee . It was alright . 
My sister , Kat , was born to dance . 
NARNIA FOREVER . 
When temperatures get to high , the elderly will start to die . 
I'm just looking forward to tomorrow . 
Big Mexican Party : Complete 
Everything you know is false . 
SEPHORA SHOPPERS : I have a gift card for $15 . What should I get ? What's a must have ? 
TACO < PROPFEMALE > . SEVEN LAYER BURRITOS . 
I am currently pretending tomorrow isn't happening . 
B lunch . 
And the horrible thing is , I have to go back tomorrow . 
You know what < PROPFEMALE > ? Fuck your dream . 
I have to go to work tomorrow . :/ 
No Grandma , sitting and watching movies never gets old . 
I don't believe in God , and I certainly don't believe in you . 
ATTENTION : I'm writing for The Edge , the OEHS newspaper . I am a writer for alternative news and my topic is about bi-racial students . If you are bi-racial or multi-racial and are interested in interviewing with me to potentially be in this publication , please contact me . 
Does anyone know any bi-racial kids ? 
I watched Noroi last night with my favorite person in the entire world . 
I'm making soup , and I do believe it is incredible . 
NO DRUGS . NO ALCOHOL . NO MEAT . NO GOD . 
Today isn't going as well as I thought it would . 
Today , I wore a gray t-shirt . And I felt very beautiful . 
Not only do I have < PROPMALE > work to do , I'm also feeling very unprofessional and aggressive . Hopefully , I'll be back later . 
I just woke up from an hour nap . I feel professional and ready to work . 
I think everyone in my house should shut the fuck up . I have a story to write . 
I'm really not looking forward to this weekend . I have to work Friday and Saturday . I just want to get out of that hell hole already . 
Mama is tired from a day at work . 
Things I'm sick of seeing : Leisurely walks with sweatpants swagger . Frantic birthday mothers . \I love God \"." 
I have to be at work at 3 . I just worked last night . I just wanted to spend a day with < PROPFIRST > . 
When I look at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , I want to throw up . She is one of the most hideous people I have ever seen . 
My four year old cousin said that Boots , from < PROPFEMALE > the Explorer , is a hot mess . 
Mmm . Cheese and carrot sandwich . 
Can anyone tell me what that Obama speech was about ? The one on at school yesterday ? 
It isn't very often that my lack of religious beliefs interfere with my personal wants . The topic of death makes me fight this battle everyday . I want an afterlife . I always want to be able to love . But my logic tells me otherwise . This is something that kills me faster than I am naturally dying . 
I GOT MY HOMECOMING DRESS . 
Really , it's all coming together now . 
I work incredibly hard in school and do exceptionally well , but in my house , I'm still the \dumbass bitch\ " . Thanks mom . Glad I'm doing you proud . " 
Today is the day ... I buy a car . 
Grandma : That's whats her face ! I didn't know she was in this movie . \ 
Me : < PROPFEMALE > Keller isn't in this movie . ( Intense Laughter ) 
Welcome to Hell , ladies . I am the authority . I'm here to take you with me . I'm here to take you down . 
I have a one shoulder dress for Homecoming . What should I do with my hair ? 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN THE NOVEMBER ISSUE OF THE EDGE ? 
Triscuits are the bravest crackers that I have ever met . 
People like you are the reason why I keep my contact with humans limited . You've shown me how self centered one person can really be and how condescending the uninformed truly are . The words that manage to escape from your ignorant mouth are nothing more than disgusting lies . All I have to say is , good luck kid . You're going nowhere with that fucking vanity . 
If I killed someone , would you turn me in ? 
I want to come out of my ( journalist ) cave and start living again . 
STUDENTS OF OEHS : MESSAGE ME IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN A SURVEY FOR THE EDGE . 
I had so many visitors at work today ! 
Today , I had a problem with my debit card . McDonald's charged me twice for an order ( $9.98 ) that I bought on the 30th . I went to the location where the purchase was made , and they refunded my debit card . My refund won't be given to me until Monday . And hopefully , it works . If not , McDonald's Corporate will be hearing from me every hour on the hour . 
I think I have my new editorial topic . 
I really like that I was able to spend this weekend with my < PROPFIRST > . I just feel like this weekend changed my life . 
I saw The Social Network with < PROPFIRST > this evening . I rated it a 9/10 on IMDb . 
ATTENTION : If you or someone you know is STRAIGHT EDGE or against the straight edge movement , please contact me . 
Does anyone know < PROPFIRST > Showerman's email or phone number ? 
Sometimes , I want to go out to my ally , scream at the top of my lungs , punch into the air , hopefully hitting someone in the process , and fall to the ground once all of my rage has been let out . I need to sweat out these demons . This is all caused from journalism . I need my life back . I need to fucking terrorize the town . \ 
And I fucking hate FOX NEWS . 
It looks like this is all coming together now . 
And I once again , have created a monster ! 
I really need to get to work . But I'm not really feeling it right now . 
I was so sick feeling today after school . I couldn't even go to work . Now , I'm feeling better , but I'm still not feeling right . 
I have to go paint my claw to go with my dress . 
YYY is brilliant . 
TONIGHT I'M NOT TAKING NO CALLS CAUSE I'LL BE DANCIN . 
I had such a great time last night . I looked so good . < PROPMALE > looked incredible . And tomorrow is my birthday ! 
Today is my birthday . I was hospitalized early this afternoon . 
I went to surgery at 7 and had my galblatter removed . I'm back in my room , IV hooked , and really tired . I'm finally on a clear liquids diet . 
I was just discharged from the hospital . My surgery went great ; I no longer have a gallblatter . Doctors discovered 6 stones , all around 1 to 2 cm in size . I was believed to only have 1 . I won't be returning to school or work until , at the earliest , Monday of next week . I'm exhausted , having trouble walking & moving , & I have a liquid diet for the next week . Thank you for all of your love , concern , & support . \ 
- Liv 
< PROPMALE > is so good to me . I love him so much . 
I can't wait until I get off my painkillers and regain my strength . I think I'm gonna chop the hell out of my hair . 
Considering that I just had surgery and my doctor said to stay away from stressful situations , I will be avoiding all ignorant white trash rants and arguments . 
I can't wait to get better . There are so many things I want to do . 
I don't like that my medicine makes me overly emotional . I've been sad all day . Now I'm crying , eating chocolate covered pretzels , and watching The Nanny all because I miss < PROPMALE > . God . 
My < PROPFIRST > is the most dramatic dog I've ever seen . 
I'm ordering out for dinner this evening . What should I get ? 
I am addicted to bathing . Seriously . I haven't been able to take a bath since Monday the 11th . Only stupid showers . I used to take two baths a day , at the least . And because I had surgery and have healing wounds , I cannot take a bath , according to my surgeon . I am going crazy . I need a bath , now . 
This is my crazy work schedule for next week . \

If anyone can find out the name of the actor who plays < PROPMALE > , from Paranormal Activity 2 , you will be a saint . 
Got off work early . Hittin ' up that < PROPFEMALE > Cuisine and then maybe doing some hair cutting . 
I had such a great day today . Got to work around 8:20 , got off at 3 . I got to see < PROPFIRST > for hours . Halloween is over , meaning I get to work two days a week again instead of 6 ... this is great .

I'm really excited for tomorrow . I finally get a day off , actually two , to spend with my < PROPFIRST > . A successful time , yes ? 
Does anyone know if there's a setting option to switch to the international date format ? I hate reading backwards dates . 3 November 2010 .

Do you enjoy my accent ? 
If you are Muslim , I need to interview you . Like now . 
I just feel worn out , tired , and thirsty . I think I'm getting a cold or something . Just in time for my Kansas City trip ! 
I'm not ready for this trip . 
I'm coming home tomorrow . 
To be honest with you , more likely than not , you're nothing . 
I know that I'm not living as who I want to live when I am working to die . It simply cannot be done . 
I just want to do Chicago proud . 
I think I'm going to go to Ulta to stock up today . 
I really like that black guy from SNL . 
I'm ready to get out of school . I need to get out . Quickly .
