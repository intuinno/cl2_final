I just realized that almost every show that comes on for kids is live action . What happened to the cartoons being for kids ? I mean , real cartoons have become extinct . Unfortunately , the crap that is made to replace them is so mind blowingly awful that it stuns me that people haven't just stopped watching it all together . I honestly wonder how in the world these networks are still receiving views . 
 I dont appreciate being talked about behind my back by my own teacher and a bunch of whiny students ! A teacher should act their own age and not like a fo
