Woohoo ! 2010 ! Another year to be as crazy as possible and give the rest of the world something to talk about ! 

I sent a happy new years text to a lot of you , and discovered shortly after sending that I typed 2012 not 2010 ... fail . To further my shame the phone proceeded to send the message over and over again , so if you got 8 copies of the inaccurate message , sorry ... 
I know pokemon profile picture month is over but ... I feel so lonely if I'm the only one in my profile picture D: 
so many sleepless nights are finally taking their toll on me ... 
I'm dead bored ... Anyone volunteering to let me draw a picture of them ? please ? :) 
Will never , ever , EVER be able to watch the weather channel the same way EVER again XD ( thanks < PROPFIRST >...) 
??????????????????! ??????????????? :D 
is working with Sami to come up with my own religion XD 
yay ! My parents have gone from thinking I'm going to die alone to thinking that I'm going to marry a serial killer , my future's steadily improving ! 
< PROPMALE > ! The Broadway ... It's gonna be great , people ! XD 
Hates being sick :( It's not fun ... 
is back from spending the day with family and < PROPFIRST > on the boat ! And is ... so ... tired ... 
Okay , Sami , I uploaded all the pictures of our picnic of failure , the slime , and the sleepover ! and just for the hell of it , some of the boat :P 
is sad cuz she missed the parade :( 
??????????? 
is feeling strangely accomplished XD I can do 10 push-ups without collapsing , my arm muscles have grown !! 
just tried Ramune , tempura , and eel for the first time in my life and loved them all intensely ! :D 
Was at the beach yesterday ... sunburn isn't as bad as I thought it would be , but I have been scarred for life XD * shudders * 
Still happy from Friday XD Had an AMAZING time with Sami on lake conroe ~ ! 
Oreo ... is ... gone ! XD 
Meatloaf surprise ( meatloaf , peanut butter , bananas , mustard and cream cheese ) is a surprisingly delicious ... 
is more sad than I should be that a facebook quiz told me i was going to Hell ... XD 
is suddenly very very happy . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > prefers Mr. Clean ~ ! Oooh !! 
.... I just got a Twitter ... ARE YOU HAPPY < PROPFIRST > ???? 
Hahaha , today < PROPFEMALE > and I swam in the lake and were NOT attacked by leeches ! :D Good last day of summer . 
soccer practice ... Fun , but I could have been much much better DX 
Is hoping that this weekend will take mercy on me soon and decide to become a whole lot less crappy . 
Can't wait wait wait to see < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow ! :D I miss my sister !!! 
Feels the need to post a new status , but although I've had a very eventful day I have nothing extremely significant to say ... 
There was sure a variety of people at the < PROPFIRST > Mraz concert ! Young people , old people , hippies , couples , awkward couples , people you liked to dance , people who just read books ... and people in body bags . XD 
Has heard from a few too many people that my thumbnail picture makes me look naked but ... I just don't have that many pictures of myself ! I can't find anything else to use ! D: 
Hahaha , I'm uploading the pictures now ! No one attack me ! XD 
NO BRACES , YES !!!!!!! 
Homecoming with < PROPFIRST > and cool people = fun time :) Almost dying of heat exhaustion at soccer game = not fun ... 
It's pretty sad that so many people are home sick that facebook is actually pretty lively during school hours ... 
Yuck . Has finally managed to get the taste of vomit completely from my mouth , but I think I'm done being sick for good now . 
Rain <3 
Day before the PSAT ... and I'm thinking about completely other things . 
FIRST WIN OF THE SOCCER SEASON ~ !!! 7-0 :D 
You need to be screaming for those balls !!! > XD 
Has still not decided what I'm going to be for halloween ... And is starting to worry . D: 
Wow ... I have managed to find one of the most epic stalker songs ever ... NEW FAVORITE , mwuhahaha ~ ! :D 
Sooo ... Is there anyone who could possibly give me the last half of the chapter 9 notes ? :D 
AAAAGHH !!! Demon mosquitoes !!! 
Uh ... complimentary nuts !!! 
... is slightly confused about how I managed to wake up under the blankets of a bed that's not mine still fully dressed in my daytime clothes . Actually , it's mostly just the under the blankets part that confuses me . 
Skillet's concert was AMAZING ! Even with a freshly-sprained ankle . 
It's thanksgiving , everybody ! Let us rip into the carcasses of birds and rejoice over the Europeans ' slaughtering of thousands of Native Americans to allow us to live here ! 
You know , the more I grow up , the more I realize life really isn't the way I remembered it looking in my coloring books . 
... I looked through my friends list today and realized the majority of my friends have spontaneously turned into pokemon ... EPIDEMIC OF AWESOME ! 
My dear friend , it's turtles all the way down !!! 
Really ? It's Christmas , for heaven's sake , please stop arguing ... 
Turns out that biking through the icy rain to subway because I was craving a five dollar foot long MIGHT not have been one of my smartest ideas ... 
Woohoo ~ So it turns out that Randalls enjoys serving big bottles of Italian soda to minors in the same paper bags that they serve bottles of alcohol ... But the cop car didn't notice . ;P 
Wow ... 5 or so long hours of filming and the filming of A Whole New World Japanese-style is DONE !!! Now sensei's got to give < PROPFIRST > and I that extra credit ! XD 
Eeee ! ( insert nerdy fangirl squeal ) Book fair with < PROPFEMALE > to see < PROPFEMALE > Marr ! 
I ... Hugged ... < PROPFEMALE > Marr ... 8D EPICCC !!!!! ( And to all you out there , be warned ! I am likely to submit you to my nerdy fangirl flashbacks of this moment for the rest of eternity ... you've been warned ) 
I like to mole it , mole it ! :D 
It may say I'm online , but I'm not . Facebook is just taking FOREVER to upload this mole project so I'm leaving it here while I sleep ... 
Mole Project is UP !!! :D 
Stupid < PROPMALE > Button , you're just jealous because you're old now and can't skate like Yevgeny Plushenko ! 
This research paper will kill me .... I read my peer edits only to realize my entire essay is crap and practically needed to be completely rewritten and reorganized ... All tonight ... 
Wow , I love how all the people I'm talking to on facebook right now are supposed to be doing their research papers :P 
... Am I morbid for procrastinating on my homework by looking up arthritic diseases I might have because my foot feels like its getting no blood , or does everyone do that kind of stuff ? 
Missed the snow D: 
Teehee , what do you call a fish with no eyes ? ... A fsh ! XD 
Oh , you silly duck who turns into a girl who turns into a monster-fighting ballerina < PROPFEMALE > ... A REAL duck couldn't dance the Nutcracker ! 
Tehee , today is 3-2-10 , it's a countdown ! 
Okay , birthday people , we really need to get this all worked out . 8 or 7:15 ? We can < PROPFEMALE > out before , and after we have the choice of just < PROPFEMALE > ing some more or my parents have offered to take us all to dinner . Dono ? 
Not saying I'm not amused , but why is it that so many songs are considered explicit for the most ridiculous reasons but a song can say \fother mucker\ " and totally get away with it ? " 
Is MAD !!!! Who took the Last Unicorn off of Youtube ??? D:< They must perish ! 
Last day of spring break DX 
Wow , I sure love to come home to bird corpses lined up on my front porch waiting to be buried ... Yep , it's spring alright , and the stupid birds are hitting my windows ... 
Today I messed up at a 4-way stop and stopped when I had the right of way . So I panicked and hit the gas too fast trying to make up for my ill-timed stop ... The old man walking on the street I was heading for just froze and stared at me like I was the scariest thing he'd ever seen in his life . I'd consider my first drive a thirty minutes well spent . 
You have me very , very worried . You know who you are . 
That's it . My life is complete . I have found a song about a girl name < PROPFEMALE > that I actually like and isn't about schizophrenic stalkers or flowers . 
No , I refuse to believe it . He's a ten year old fish , I was convinced he was going to live it forever . 
Yay Easter ! The holiday where the rebirth of Christ somehow translates to an excuse for children to bite the heads off of defenseless animals made of chocolate ! WOOT ! 
EEK !!! Washington DC in only two days !! DX 
I can't decide if I'm excited or scared ... Tomorrow I get on a plane ( yipee ! ) to Japan Bowl ( eek ! ) 
DC was awesome ( ba-ba-ba-ba-ba , I want your bus ticket ~ ) and 14th place in my < PROPMALE > fair ... Weekend successful . :) 
We must not be in Ixopo anymore , cuz the only Tittihoya's I see are yours ;) Lolz , English class . 
Wow ... So Mackie IS alive after all this time , afterall ! :P

Happy Mother's Day to the most awesomesauce , crazy , wild -- CHEESE ! -- Mother ever :D I know you don't have a facebook and will never read this , but jic ;) love you ~ 
the AP World test is tomorrow ... I suddenly want to run away and escape to Mexico overnight . DX 
Wants to stab this English Project so much ... 
Really , Mrs. Hecktor ? Really ?! I just needed a 90 to get an A in your class for the semester and what do you give me ? An 89.49 ! Would it have killed you to give me a score . 01 higher and let me NOT take your final ?! URGH !!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Wisniowiecki , I hope you love your new hair that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Malone and I gave you , hahaha ;) 
Alright guys , I'm off to Costa Rica tomorrow morning and so I won't be receiving any texts or checking Facebook until next Sunday . I'll miss you ! :) 
Good news : Costa Rica was super fun ! Bad news : I might have yellow fever ... yay ? 
I'm really tired of my blood stream randomly deciding to cut off the circulation of my limbs . 
SCREW YOU , URUGUAY ! That was a dirty way to win a game ! 
You are the BIGGEST PERSON I have ever met ! = Vienna's idea of an insult ? XD 
Thanks Aleischa Kronshagen , < PROPMALE > Holloway , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Wisniowiecki , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Malone , < PROPFEMALE > Soundy , and < PROPFIRST > Cunningham for a sthuper fun Quelf game ! :D ( All hail the Chinese cheese biscuit ) 
I GOT A 5 ON MY AP WORLD HISTORY EXAM !!!!! WOOHOOOOO !!!!!! 
Alright , I am in the drawing mood . Do I have any volunteers to be drawn ? 
Had SUCH a fun day today :D 
Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > Barrow , for knowing exactly what I need to hear :) 
I find myself looking at all these drag queens and transvestites who are just dying to be women , and wonder why every girl can't have that appreciation for the body they were born with . 
I helped return two lost dogs to their home today :D Even though it did require chasing after them for an hour in the hot sun with cheap flip flops that gave me blisters , I'm happy ! 
YAYYY !!!! Proposition 8 has been overturned ! :D <3

< PROPFEMALE > Barrow is a very scary woman . 
Spent the day with < PROPFEMALE > Cunningham , and watched Vampires Suck ! :D

Girls in stripper heels , boys rolling in Maseratis . What they need in this world is some love ~ 
I like it on the bar and on the stairs !! ;) 
DON'T RUN OUT IN THE ROAD , PLEASE !!! 
Sometimes I think little kids are the smartest people out there , because they aren't afraid to see the truth for what it is . 
Like my status and I'll tell you : 1 . Something I've learned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . The color you remind me of . 3 . My first memory of you . 4 . The animal you remind me of . 5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 . My favorite thing about you . 7 . Give you a weird nickname . 
Dear drama , why must you find the most inconvenient times to blow up in my face ? I'm going to ignore you now , and get some work done on one of the three < PROPMALE > grades I have due tomorrow . I hope you'll understand . 
< PROPMALE > Riddle's Magical Diary is surprisingly insightful . 
NaNoWriMo starts ... now ! 
Eeyore and Optimus Prime had the same voice actor ?! My mind hasn't been so blown since I discovered Mufasa and Darth Vader were the same man ! 
I like dinosaurs and eating cupcakes :D 
I am officially terrified of < PROPFIRST > Wain's schizophrenic cat paintings . They freak me out . 
Finally , Thanksgiving Break ! I'm so thankful !!! 
I saw < PROPMALE > Potter today . No exaggeration , in the first minute of the movie I was already crying . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! :) 
Team Nikolai !!!! 
I am so sick of the American Dream ... 
I bananas make me so exkited !!! But idk what to do with them , but they are always happy to see me :D 
FckH8.com is my new favorite thing ever :D 
All right , I give in . Give me some < PROPFIRST > . 
#666 , you would choose that number XD But seriously , I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ! Why do we not see each other anymore ? It's the saddest thing ever . We need need need to < PROPFEMALE > out and get super close again so we have all these awkward memories to laugh about while no one else understands . And I love your hair ;D 
#infinite , Bwahahaha nice choice of number . Yeah , I didn't know you so much until this year but you've turned out to be HILARIOUS and I'm so glad I met you :D Even though you do share names with a certain gay werewolf who can't keep his shirt on ~ 
#8 MY SEXY DUCK ! :D I am so glad I got to know you a little better by sitting with you in the hallways over the past few years . You're hilarious and your skills at Guitar Hero are sooo impressive ;D 
#B35T , HOW DID I KNOW MEET YOU UNTIL LAST YEAR ?!?!?! Well , I guess we met before , but how were we not friends ? You are SO awesome and crazy and my total braintwin , and I love to creep on you ! :D 
#8675309 , Firstly , I love that song XD Secondly , you are such a cool kid . I really only started talking to you this year , but you're so fun . You always make me laugh . I mean that in a good way , not like I'm laughing at you behind your back , lol .

:( 
This week has been going by so . agonizingly . slow . Christmas break , where are you ? DX 
The Japanese Christmas Party was a GREAT start to the Christmas break ! :D 
I am simultaneously filled with joy and crushed with despair . The good news : Don't Ask Don't Tell was repealed ! :D The bad news : the DREAM Act was rejected ... 
is feeling better . :) 
< PROPMALE > Harbour is entirely too nice to me and I luffle him :) Mwuhahaha , see ? I can put you in my status , too ! Revenge is sweet ! XD 
I really hope tomorrow isn't anything like today , otherwise it's going to be the worst Christmas ever . 
Goodbye , facebook . New Mexico , here I come ! :) 
Today alone my family drove through snow , a sandstorm , rain , hail , fog , a barrage of tumbleweed , and an almos t-t ornado . Finally , I'm home ! 
Goodbye break , goodbye social life ... You will be missed . 
If anyone knows of a place with a stage that wouldn't mind a group of crazy teenage girls performing a musical on it this weekend , please let me know . :) 
Finally midterms are over !!! Four-day weekend , here I come ! 
Adventure Time marathon = :D 
SAT tomorrow ... Wish me luck ! 
Congratulations < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Sumrall , < PROPFIRST > Cunningham , Ashe < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > Boudreaux . Starmites was amazing ! :) 
Memory foam xD 
Just spent the entire afternoon helping my mom start a Facebook account . xD 
Aaaaaahhhh ! SAT Scores are in !!! :D 
Surprisingly , spending eleven hours at the school running around on Mrs. < PROPMALE>'s command looking for things that don't exist was actually really fun . Congrats to < PROPMALE > and Aleischa Kronshagen for making state at VASE ! ... And < PROPMALE > Holloway for being there xD 
Ladies ' night out with Yurina Kari-Kenji Sako , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Malone , and Aleischa Kronshagen was so much fun ! :) 
Owie , I have a big , nasty bruise on my knee from leaping full-speed into the bushes with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Malone to hide from Aleischa Kronshagen and < PROPMALE > Holloway . 
Watch out , world , I am now a licensed driver ! 
Aleischa Kronshagen , < PROPMALE > Holloway , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Malone , < PROPFEMALE > Brown , and < PROPFEMALE > Cantor , I really need you guys to send me your Japan Bowl packet info ! 
Well , I guess that's it . I went to my first rodeo with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Wisniowiecki yesterday and now I'm officially a Texan . 
I'm going out of my mind , I'm so nervous for my Waterway piece !!! Everyone , please wish Aleischa Kronshagen and I good luck ~ 
So far , spring break has been wonderful ! I don't want to start school again ... 
Dear Sims , I know you're trying to teach me that I should save my game more frequently , but randomly shutting off and deleting weeks of my sims ' lives is NOT COOL . Seriously . 
Blueberry ~ :) 
Even upon close inspection , Aleischa Kronshagen's face is the most beautiful thing I have ever laid my eyes on . Gosh , it's good to be drawing again :) 
Wow , I wasn't expecting Shattered Lives to make such an impact on me , but seeing my friends die and hearing the parents talk actually made me cry . A very good program .
