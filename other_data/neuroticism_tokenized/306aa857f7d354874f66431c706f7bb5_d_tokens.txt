Contemplating how to cut my hair , just a trim or chop it off ? 

My sister is kinda bad at lightening hair . :P

Sick of Wal-mart , if things don't change after my next paycheck , then I'm done .

Note to people I don't know : Just cuz we have a mutual interest ( ie : Suicide Girls ) , it doesn't mean I wanna talk to you . \ 
I'd rather only add friends or friends of friends , not random creepers . \ 
Also , no old guys unless I know you , I don't have daddy issues . 
Went to work at Game Stop today , but apparently the computer deleted me from their store list so I was sent home after 10 minutes . \ 
Now I have to go back tomorrow after they fix it , but at least I get paid an extra hour for that crap . :) 
Hopefully that error gets fixed today , the manager is supposed to call soon to tell me what's up . \ 
I don't wanna lose hours & money just because somebody fucked up . :P 
Everything got fixed , yay for hours at Game Stop again ! :)
