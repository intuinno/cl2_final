2011 . This is going to be the best year of my life . :D 

Forever and ever (: 
< PROPFEMALE > and Dior . XD 
Is it just me , or do you think all the time ? Am I going insane , because I can't get you off my mind ? Will it mean anything , when I say will you be my < PROPFIRST > ? 
Nervous haha b : 
Worried :/ 
Might be too farrrrr :o 
Tired ... 
Wishing I was with you almost every minute of the day ... 
She All On My Skin , Lotion , Slower Motions , Roller Coastin , Like Back Forth Hold It ( Hold It ) .... She Pose Like It's For Posters , And I Poke Like I'm Suppose To !

God damn < PROPFIRST > , \like\ " all my activities why don't you ?? XD " 
I hope you feel better .. ): 
they'll tear us apart , if you give them the < PROPMALE > , don't sell your heart , don't say we're not meant to be , run baby run , forever we'll be , you and me .. 
Friday ! ( : I'm pumpedd !!! <3 
I have something to tell you and you'll just have to wait :p 
Crazy ideas ! XD 
“Dreams are like stars ... you may never touch them , but if you follow them they will lead you to your destiny . ” <- I hope we share the same dreams ? I miss you .. 
Don't be scared , Because I'll never let you down , I'll never do wrong , and I'll never lie . I will remain loyal , honest , and true . And as the days go by , I seem to need you , more and more . <3 
Sorry .. 
You mustn't dwell on your past because , well , you can't change it and what's happened has happened . You can , however , create your future and I believe ours will be amazing <3 
If you can do it , then you know you have a part of me , and that part of me will always be yours , even if it takes forever . I just hope you can deal with me forever haha (; 
Nice day outside , not sure what I am going to do but I'm going out for a few hours . 
Warm weather , spring break , an amazing and beautiful girl , and with so much to do .. what's not to love ? :D 
What's better than relaxing , listening to music , Spring break ( besides summer of course ) and knowing you have someone so special to be with during it all ? Exactly . <3

A wise man once said nothing . It is better to remain silent and have people think you are stupid , than to speak and remove all doubt . 
How come , at the end of the day , everything seems to be just fine , and you think back and wonder ... why couldn't it be like this earlier ? 
It's chillyyyy . 
There's not a thing that I would change . ( : 
I am not so much a man of words , as I am a man of love . For without you , I am nothing . Words are but a false hope to those who believe , you must show what you mean , to truly mean it . 
Silence solves nothing . It is those who try , that make it all worthwhile . 
The words struck him like arrows , his heart bleeding with the pain of emotion . Yet he still goes on , knowing that the pain will fade , that all will come to an end , with love still standing in the midst of it all . That , is faith . Never backing out , never leaving the fight , never giving into the pain , but carrying on through it all . For with this , nothing can stop the true lover . Nothing . 
If caring for someone is telling them what to do , then I guess im a loving boss . I hope you understand . 
is a fool for hoping so much . ... <3 
has a lot of time on his hands . 
And we all moved with the beat , afraid to stray from its path to lose time , to lose the notes that have been left , and to mess up the constantly flowing rhythm . 
WoW 
had such a wonderful day today (: <3 Can't wait for tomorrowwww ! :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Munoz makes me oh so happy (: <3 <3 <3 
11 months (: 
Every time those words are spoken it's as if a new scar has formed on his body , something he can't get rid of , something he has to live with no matter what . Sometimes they may not be there to him , and he may even forget them , but they are always there , protruding from his skin like a disease in which he cannot escape , a terror in which he has to live by .

If you could go 2 years and make the same salary as going 4 years .. which would you pick ? But if you wanted to go a total of 6 years .. would you do 4 first off and then 2 later ? or would you do 2 first off and then another 2 and proceed to do the final 2 ? Ending the night with a torn mind .. 
Hmm hmm hmmmm
