I am learning from my mistakes ... you have to pay for your education , and apparently it is quite expensive ! 

Thanks everyone for the Birthday wishes !!!!!!

Part 1 : Today , I opened what should have been a brand new 12oz container of creamcheese that I bought from Shopright . Upon removing the grey plastic lid , I discovered that the foil seal , which is supposed to be air-tight , was half way unsealed . Upon further inspection , I found a quite obvious impression in the creamcheese itself that could only have been made by someone's finger ! 
Thank you to all of my friends for the great Birthday wishes !! =) 
Just got an iPhone 4 .... wow , this thing is AMAZING !!!!!!!
