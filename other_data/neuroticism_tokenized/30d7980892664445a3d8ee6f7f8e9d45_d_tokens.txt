The pressure is on . A little over 8 weeks and we are on a flight over the big pacific . It is going to be here before I even know it . Yikes !!!! 
As the time comes to go I am scared that things will go awry . Although I am sure things will go fine without a hitch even . I always seem to get a terrible stomach ache every time I fly . 
So the big count down begins . 15 days left . 
Well by next Tuesday I should be looking at a beautiful beach . Just too bad that I have to leave family behind . That is the hardest part . <3 I will let you all know when we have made it though . :)

I am thankful for finally having a home to rest my head , two have two lovely children that are so resilient . I am also thankful for the fact that I have the support of my wonderful husband . 
Now that we have spent our livelyhood at the commissary . I am just too tired to care . 
Well , a trip to Homedepot and then the beach . The later makes for a very peaceful Sunday . By gosh I believe that is a song my dear . :)

That was a very depressing ending to a won game . Tigers what the heck . 
Dance party in the livingroom . Got to love it . 
My New Years Resolution is to lose 20lbs by the end of the year . 40 would be better but 20 is more realistic . Eating right and exercising when I am not hurting . This is the goal . 
I am tired . Cleaned entire house , but am excited to have shipment of yarn in soon so I can try a new stitch . I know how it sounds , but all that know me , know that my passion is Crocheting and Baking . 
Recived new furniture today , but poor , little < PROPFEMALE > was sick with 104.2 fever and coughing most of the day . Hoping that the little champ feels better in the morning . 
I am starting to feel a little better . All I have left is a cough . No fever for 24 hrs . 
I loved you the moment I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the moment you kicked me in the ribs . I loved you the minute you were born ; then I saw your face and fell even more in love with your beautiful self . Even though you were just only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . 
Cleaning house and making cookies today . 
All I can say . By looking at the weather back in the states . 18 degrees is a little too cold . Yep not missing that for sure .

My daughter cracks me up sometimes . Here I am setting up her game on the computer and apparently not doing it to her liking . So she tells me that she is breaking up with me . 
Love when your kids are just as kooky as you are . Kids are singing and dancing to cho cho song . 
Reading news stories . Man the midwest is getting slamed with snow and ice . Stay safe everyone . I am loving the 80 degree weather . 
Have been crocheting alot lately . Finnished one throw and am working on the next . 
All I can sy is that looking at the weather back in Little Rock and 12 degrees at 8 am is pretty dang cold . So glad that I am here and not there . 
We usually do not celebrate the big V day , but since I have been feeling down . My baby brought me the most beautiful boquet today at lunch time . Of course he does this spontanously through out the year also . I love you babe . 
watching the replacements and lmao . 
Between the State Farm commercials and the Red < PROPFIRST > commercial I have laughed a good portion of the night . That young man hidding in the curtain was hilarious . 
Just finished a baby blankie for a friend that just found out . Loving the heart doily shapes . So cute . 
All I can say is that I finally get something out of my head . After much work and listening to other tunes , and there you go and put the forgotten back in there . You know who you are . Curse you !!! 
We are safe . According to news we only saw three feet . Thank you lord . We live on top of a mountain range so we weren't all too worried . Call me crazy but I had wished that it was daylight so I could look at the waves . 
Banana 
I am really sick and tired of inconsiderate , complete , flucking morons with their stupid peaces of crap motorcycles . 
I am so glad that I am done with homework . I cannot look at another article on Gandhi . 
Helping my daughter with math . Getting a headache . 
For here I am , with everyone in the household asleep , and I with chapters of < PROPFIRST>'s literature running through my head . Will sleep never come ? 
I believe that my little girl has been watching too much Disney . At every turn she says , OIG . Meaning OMG . lol 
Insomnia ? Study Confucius and Daoism . Yep that is the fix to put me to sleep . Finish homework in the morning . Goodnight .
