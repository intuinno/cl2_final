It is how we use our lives that determines what kind of men we are ... I am convinced that the truest act of courage , the strongest act of manliness , is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice . To be a man is to suffer for others . God help us be men . \\ 
Do not be too moral . You may cheat yourself out of much life . Aim above morality . Be not simply good ; be good for something . \

There are three truths in life :\ 
Jewish people do not recognize Jesus as the Messiah . \ 
Protestants do not recognize the Pope as the leader\ 
of the Christian faith . \ 
Baptists do not recognize each other in the liquor store . 
Why do Baptists object so strongly to pre-marital sex ? \ 
They're afraid it might lead to drinking and dancing .

“All men dream : but not equally . Those who dream by night in the < PROPFIRST > recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity : but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men , for they may act their dreams with open eyes , to make it possible . ”\
