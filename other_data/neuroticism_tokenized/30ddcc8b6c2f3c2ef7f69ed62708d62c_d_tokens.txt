( CONT'D ) . So if you smash your thumb with a hammer , particularly during this first month , just smile . \ 
WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY : \Holy @#$ *!!\" \ 
FOR NEW DADS ( LOL ): Now that your wife's given birth , there is no physical pain you can experience that will ever equate . Unless , of course , you have a 10 lbs bowel movement that lasts btwn 12 & 48 hrs that several ppl watch , including your mother in law . And even this is not quite the same thing . Therefore you are no longer allowed to feel any pain yourself , lest you want to get eviscerated by your wife ( CONT'D ) 
< PROPMALE > weighs a whopping 6 lbs 5 oz . 
Wooo !!! 6 more weeks !! Getting so close !! 
Trying to get motivated to clean . It's just not working . At the rate I'm going now , I wont get done until next Saturday :\\

Looking to buy a house !! I want to move out sooo bad !!! :( I hate debt :( 
T.G.I.F. 
I think if someone asks me if I'm having twins again , I just might grow horns and a tail and send them to Hades !! Seriously ! I know I'm big , do you really have to remind me ? I have to see myself in the mirror everyday ! PLUS , I am short and have close to no torso , so , where else is my little baby going to grow but OUT ?!?! 
I ran out of books to read !!! * bites nails * What am I going to do now ??? 
Going out to eat with the hubby and father-in-law . 
3 cm's and counting !! 
Wondering if I'm going to make it to the weekend ...... This week is going to crazy busy at work with school starting ! Cross your fingers I don't go into labor at work !! < PROPFIRST > would run around like a chicken with his head cut off and prolly call an ambulance when I work only a few < PROPMALE > down the road from my hospital . LOL 
Everyone cross your fingers that I don't go into labor at least until this weekend !! 
So tired & exhausted , but cant sleep :(

I forgot to put that we are in room 17 at Sacred Heart Hospital 
Just moved to room 268 in Sacred Heart Hospital . Expected to be here til Sunday 
< PROPMALE > got weighed again today . He now weighs 8lbs 9.2 oz . 
We made it home safely . Wishing I would have stayed in the hospital for another day though . It's hard to get in and out of bed when it doesn't move up and down lol . < PROPMALE > is doing GREAT !! He barely fusses at all , he just sits and looks around the room at everything . I was scared to be a mom . However , it's the best thing that's ever happened to me <3 I love my son :D 
We got pictures done at the hospital . If anyone wants to take a look at them and/or order some prints , please let me know and I'll give you the password . 
Today has been just wonderful ... NOT !! < PROPMALE > got circumsized , and he kept bleeding so we took him to ER , spent a couple of hours there . Poor thing :( Now we find out that ALL of the formula we bought him has been recalled due to beetle parts being in the powder . Gotta love those late night trips to Wal-Mart :\\ 
< PROPMALE > is doing SO much better today ! Thank God for infant tylenol & vaseline :) 
So tired of watching football all day ... I guess that's what I get for marrying a sports fanatic :\\ 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s house (<PROPFIRST>'s mom ) eating Zaxby's and watching movies ! < PROPMALE > just can't get enough lovin ' lol . 
Sooooo tired . It seems like I never get enough sleep . I don't know what I would do without < PROPFIRST > . He has been a HUGE help with < PROPMALE > . Not to mention very understanding to the way I've been feeling . I thank God for him everyday !! 
Going to Orange Park tomorrow to visit Granna and family !! Then off to South < PROPFEMALE > for the family reunion !! So excited ! Please pray for mine and < PROPMALE>'s safe travel and that he sleeps a good part of the way :D 
TARGET BRAND DIAPERS SUCK !!! Every time < PROPMALE > poops , the poo comes out of the front and back of the diaper !! DON'T BUY THEM !! 
BORED . 
Can't sleep ... and it's not because of < PROPMALE > . The little guy is just-a-snoozing away . Wish I could sleep that peacefully . 
Mr. Sandman , bring me a dream ... ( I think that's how it goes ... lol ) 
I like it on the floor . 
Sooo tired !! 
Back home from South < PROPFEMALE > . Wish I could have spent more time there :\\ <3 missing my husband terribly <3 
God has blessed me with cutest son ever !! <3 
Thank you Mrs. Joy for letting me get a full nights sleep while you watch < PROPMALE > !!! <3 
Excited about going back to Pensacola tomorrow . Can't wait to be back in my husbands arms and my comfy bed . Sad to leave Orange Park , my family , and close friends . 
Excited about the new Smallville season !!! 
A Sunday full of laundry , football , and going to try and work on the giraffe painting for Bryson's room that I have put off for 6 months now . I'm such a bad aunt :( 
Blah . So not motivated today ... at least I found an image to draw onto the canvas .... lol 
Woot woot . Hooked my computer up to the TV !!! Now I can finally get on the computer and not have to fight < PROPFIRST > for it :D 
< PROPFIRST > GOT A PROMOTION AT WORK TODAY !!!!!!!!!! 
Wants to go home & play Aion ... 
Slow day at work . Grandma is watching < PROPMALE > so it's pretty quiet here :\\ I wanna go home and go to sleep !! 
Taking < PROPMALE > to his doctors appointment to get his first set of shots :( Poor baby . I hope he doesn't cry a lot . 
I deleted all of my mail contacts . So if you want me to have your e-mail address , please message it to me with your first and last name . 
TGIF !!!!! 
Blah ... 
Can't believe I missed Smallville to come be ignored at < PROPFEMALE > Back .... 
HD video cameras = awesome , upload rate = FREAKIN FOREVER !! ( fail ) 
Sometimes I wanna smack people in the face and ask them what they were thinking at the time they did something really stupid . Oh wait ... they probably weren't thinking !! 
So blah today :\\ 
OMG such a busy day at work . My head hurts , my back hurts , my eyes hurt from looking at so many < PROPFIRST > , and I'm so ready to go home ! 
< PROPMALE>'s Christmas wish list is up on Target.com 
< PROPMALE > spent this past weekend with his Grandma and LAUGHED !! >:( So upset that I missed it . However , this morning he held his bottle by himself :D My little boy is growing up so fast ... 
I really hate the government . I don't see how some people can get stuff , but apparently we don't qualify ... 
Had an awesome Christmas . Hope everyone else did too :D 
So I just saw 3 police officers chasing someone on foot on 12th avenue around the little bridge ... LoL 
So < PROPMALE > weighs 15lbs and is 25 inches long ! He is now holding his own bottle and sitting up on his own in little spurts then falls over lol . Oh how they grow up so fast !! <3 
Watching the faces your kid makes while pooping is the best free entertainment , but also the smelliest . LOL 
Soooo ... thinking about getting a web-cam so I can do Skype video calls with people I don't get to see on a regular basis so they can see and talk to < PROPMALE > and not miss out on him growing up :) If anyone knows of a certain kind that they like or is just a good brand , let me know . 
< PROPMALE>'s hair has started falling out :( I miss his natural fo-hawk . 
Is it okay for babies to chew on paper ?? I give < PROPMALE > his toys , but all he wants to do is play with and chew on the paper that's on my desk !! 
I never really stopped to think about how music affects us . When I played Emarosa for < PROPMALE > ( which is a more vocal and softer rock ) , he was restless and was fussy and didn't want to play in his < PROPMALE > . When I switched to One Republic ( Which I think is his favorite band if he could say so lol ) , he is calm and loving and has been sitting in his < PROPMALE > for the passed 15min with his thumb in his mouth starring at me . 
So ready to enjoy my only day off !! However , not looking forward to laundry , vacuuming , cleaning the bathroom , and whatever else needs to be done . :\\ I need a maid ( one that doesn't charge lol ) . 
So , I've been researching diaper bags because I'm in need of one that can actually hold everything I need to bring with me on a daily basis and some . It seems to me that the smaller the bag ..... the more expensive it is .... WHAT ?!? How does that make sense ? And whoever comes up with the designs on these things really needs to go back to school or find a diff career ... I mean REALLY ?!? 
< PROPMALE > is 5 months today !! 
< PROPFEMALE > , had a regular check up with the girlie doctor today and was telling her about the pain I've been having on the right side of my C-section incision . So she starts poking around on my hip while I keep yelping in pain and says that she thinks I have a hernia and is referring me to a general surgeon . How great , another surgery :( 
ARGH !!! Trying to upload pictures to my computer and when I move more than 10 pictures at a time it FREEZES !! Don't buy a high speed SD card if your computer is slower than a snail !! Not to mention that is has now corrupted some of the files on my memory card !! I HATE IT WHEN THIS HAPPENS !!!! So , my computer froze and I had to manually restart it , NOW MY CARD READER WONT WORK !!! * cries * I can't finish uploading :\ ( " 
Ok , and seriously , Facebook is really starting to irritate me with the 420 < PROPMALE > characters !!! I spend all that time typing something just for it to tell me that it's too long .. why can't it have a character counter at the bottom of the comment box letting you know you are getting ready to run out of characters ? 
Buying a doorway jumper was the best $10 I have ever spent . 
So , my car got broken into night before last . Well , not really ' broken ' into ( my car was unlocked ) . Anyways , someone went though all of my stuff , but I don't think they took anything . Mainly all I have in my car are CD's and < PROPMALE>'s stuff , which I guess they don't like my taste in music and they don't have a child LoL . 
OMG so tired . I could pass out right now with my head on the keyboard at work lol . Ready to go home . 
Thank you everyone for the wonderful birthday wishes !!! I greatly appreciate it :D :D BTW , I got a webcam and can now do video Skype calls !! So if anyone wants to see/talk to < PROPMALE > look me up on Skype under tootiefrutie58 :D

Whelp , going to the doctor today to find out if I actually have a hernia or not , and if so , what needs to be done to fix it :\\ I'm so nervous ... 
Sooooo , doctor said I need surgery :( 
The surgery date is set . Gulf Breeze Hospital on 3.3.11 @ 8am . 
< PROPMALE > ate his first vegetable ( greenbeans ) on Saturday and his first fruit ( peaches ) today ! He's also drinking highly diluted apple juice LoL My little boy is growing up to fast ! 
< PROPMALE > CUT HIS FIRST TOOTH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
So come to find out , I didn't have any hernias . However , when they got in there , the scar tissue from my uterus had attached itself to my intestines which was causing me the pain . Also , the doctor said that my gallbladder wasn't looking so good and was pretty inflamed , so he removed that and took some excess tissue off of my liver . I'm up and moving around , but still in a lot of pain .

So not motivated to do anything today . Stayed up waaayyy too late last night . I'm so not able to stay up late & get up early like I used to :( 
OMG'ish!! I love my son ! When I started feeding him baby food , everytime he would take a bite , I would say mmMMMmMMMm . Now , when he eats a cookie or his food , and sometimes even drinking his juice or a bottle , he says MMmmmmMMMMmmMm the entire time ! Haha , it's so adorable ! I'll have to take a short video of it and post it :D 
So tired of not having a weekend & the house always being a mess .. idk how all you mothers who have more than 1 kid & work have any time to do anything at all .. 
OMG ! I just watched Piranha & it is the FIRST movie to EVER make make my stomach queasy ! Blek ! 
My mom sent me this email ... Never even thought of doing this , but it makes sense ! TIPS ON PUMPING GAS\ 
I don't know what you guys are paying for gasoline .... but here in California we are paying up to $3.75 to $4.10 per gallon . My line of work is in petroleum for about 31 years now , so here are some tricks to get more of your money's worth for every gallon : 
Oh , < PROPMALE > . How I love you ... but , would you please take a nap ?!? 
I can't believe my nephew is going to be ONE this week ! Time goes by so fast ! 
Correction : I can't believe my nephew is going to be one NEXT week LoL ...
