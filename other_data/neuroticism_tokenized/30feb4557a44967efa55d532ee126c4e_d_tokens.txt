what if everything you wanted to do was seconded guessed by someone else ? what do you do : continue to follow your dreams and never let anything get you down ? or second guess everything yourself and never live life for what its supposed to be and hold back on everything you do ? whatever you choose will ultimately be heart telling you whats best . 
just chillin out and having a great day . nothing is going to stop my great day . enough said . nothing could stop me from being hyper either ;) and yes i do have my strong pants on . haha

a great man once said that love conquers all and standing armies dont . well hes damn right . love can tear you into peices to try and get that feeling youve wanted from someone all your life . but the thing is is that it wont ever happen . someone or something comes along and ruins it . love once again destroys you . so yes , a great man said that and he was telling the truth all the way . 
fuck you podeLl !!!!!!! 
ive been doing the cohen final since 9 pm i hate it so much 
everything happens when and where it happens . if you get caught up it in you will be torn apart ..... 
Things occur with their natural benefits and consequences . If you are lucky enough you'll get mostly benefit . I don't know about you but i found my benefit . Sure it comes with consequences of their own but I'd would rather live with them than not have it ( her ) . 
a bit depressed and out of it .... =/ 
i feel .... broken 
SO BLAH AND ANNOYED WITH EVERYTHING ... YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH ME

finding that one person that youll deal with everything for has the greatest feeling ever <3 
youll neevr win the battle of love . over and over it will beat you down . but for me theres only one person that i stand a < PROPMALE > with 
running away from your problems dont solve them . it saves them for later to build up . before you know it you got alot of shit to deal with and realized all the people you lost ...
