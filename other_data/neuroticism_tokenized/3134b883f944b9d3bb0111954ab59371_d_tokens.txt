Corporal < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( USMC/Akron , OH ) died Dec 6 , while serving in Afghanistan . He leaves behind a wife and a newborn son , who was born approx . 24 hours after news of his death . Please repost to honor this hero and his family

< PROPFIRST > Sheen , 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 , and < PROPMALE > Stark 22 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status 
So the US Supreme Court has ruled that you have the right under the First Amendment to protest military funerals ... I invite you to start your protest in my front yard and we will see if your First Amendment is better than my Second Amendment !! Re post if you feel the same . God bless our soldiers , past and present . 
room 317 with < PROPFEMALE > Flores ;)
