Wow , actually listening to my mom . She wants to point out that today is 1/1/11 . So I guess it's like the whole 11:11 thing and making a wish ? xD 

While playing as Peach in < PROPFIRST > Kart Wii , I was backing across the finish line to win on the Boo level and I hear . \Yay ! I w o-o ohwawawawa ! \ " because she fell in a hole and screamed the last of it . How wonderful . xD " 
It suddenly just hit me like a ton of bricks that we have school tomorrow . Now I feel depressed ... xD 
I'll get a picture of myself on here as soon as I darn well feel like it ... and when I can actually find one that doesn't make me look high . D8 xD 
Wow , not even a day went by and < PROPFEMALE > somehow finds me . D8 xD I feel wuved . <3 =P 
n00b < PROPMALE > finds long lost sister < PROPFIRST > . Find out the dramatic conclusion next week ! > 8D 
The most epic way to lose a game just happened to me ... Last level , last life , last boss , on my last bit of health , the last enemy on his last bit of health ... and we both somehow manage to hit each other at the * EXACT * same time , me dying less than a millisecond before him ... Now that my friends ... is pathetic . xD 
is walking on sunshine ! 8D -shot- I can't wait to go to < PROPFIRST>'s party and harass her and our friends to the point of insanity . Luv y'all . <3 xD 
says ; OMG ! I just watch 2012 , and it was actually really good ! =DD They even saved some amimals , and for a tree hugger like me , that's great !!! =DDD xD 
I hope I'm not the only one who thinks it's strange when it says your internet isn't connected , yet it somehow is working faster than normal . xD 
Dispises Daylight Saving Time with a passion . <3 
Ahh , the first day of spring break . Nothing like waking up at 6 AM by your mom , saying that you're fridge just died epically . Then spending the second half of the day buying a new fridge and hauling up a flight of stairs , fighting with a messed up door , then rushing all your food from a cooler to the freezer . Gawd , why can't every spring break start out like this !? xDD ( Sooo joking . xD ) 
is being attacked by the headache from ' Hell , Michigan ' . D= I think slamming my head into a wall over and over would be more comfortable ... 
-Points to the answering things below- Don't you hate these things that ask questions that you KNOW will sound awkward either way you answer if your friends see it ? Eh , whatever might as well enjoy the laughs . xD 
Well , my computer is now officially against me . Sorry if I left you hanging < PROPFIRST > , I can't get it to work ! D= Good night all ! =D 
Two innocent posts together on my homepage make an epic win for my day . \i love life\ " =DDD \ " I hate everything on this cursed earth . \ " DD8 < [ Insert joke of my easily amusedness here . ] xD " 
Ya know , it kinda sucks when a friend you care about ignores you ( by accident or otherwise ) , especially when you want to know why they seem unhappy . Hmm , guess I should join a \Nosy\ " fanpage if they have one on FB . xD " 
says ' Life is a constant battle between heart and mind . While our mind warns to keep our distance , to protect ourselves and others , but our heart begs loudly , telling us to take that < PROPMALE > , to push the limits to get what we < PROPFEMALE > . Whichever one we listen to will change our lives forever ... ' (<-- Oh yes , that was very lame , and almost somewhat depressing . xD I'll lighten up again soon . =P ) 
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\ 
I recommend that everyone look at this web comic at least once . xD Sure , it's slow in the beginning , but it gets better . =P

Yippee ! Couldn't fall asleep until 3 AM and I'm hyper ! 8D But I'll probably be dead as soon as 1st hour hits . D8 
Who's ready for Choir rehersal !? YEAH ! WHOO-HOO !! ... Anyone ? ... Anyone at all ? D8 
Alright , it's official . Miley < PROPMALE > is turning into < PROPFEMALE > Spears ! ( I mean when she was a lot more trampy . ) Both started out on Disney , then dyed their hair , then started wearing skimpy outfits . Goooo STARDOM !!! 8D 
I like clowns . They are special performers . To the audiance they will always seem either happy or sad . They pretend to be these things in order to please others . They are us . People who pretend that they don't despise someone , or pretend they have no problems , or pretend that it doesn't kill them everytime they see the person they know will never accept their affections . But we live on , to pretend forever ... 
Alright my fellow anime-loving people , while my internet is working , I want to ask if anyone would have a preferred show that I could bring , and what episodes for Monday . My internet may not last long , but I'll do what I can ! I have up to episode 13 of higurashi , and ep . 4 of Lucky < PROPFEMALE > ! =D < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , this is your < PROPMALE > . xD 
Had a really good day . Having < PROPFIRST > Collins over , getting a new matress for mom , getting fast internet AND real cable with REAL channells . Had a water balloon fight at the church thing , got to < PROPFEMALE > out with Cici , < PROPFIRST > , Steph , < PROPMALE > , and ... what's that little bug's name again ? Oh well . xD 
Baaahhh , I am so bored ! D= If anyone wants to come over , or vice-versa and play games/watch movies/or something else , I think I'm going to have a pretty open scheduale after today ( Sunday ! D8 ) so by all means , let's set something up ! > 8D -Fail post fails- 
Doesn't anyone else hate it when you're talking to someone on the phone or texting and that coffee table or fan just jumps out of nowhere and attacks you ? xD 
Please tell me I'm not the only one getting frustrated by constantly having to reset all my clocks because of these power-outages . xD And wouldn't you imagine , the one that lasted the longest happened in broad daylight . xD 
Haha , watched Eclipse yesterday , and I loved it ! <3 I am so for < PROPMALE > , everyone screamed when he showed up , no one screamed for < PROPFIRST > , take that vampire . xD (^\\/^) 
-Is in that kind of mood where you go from happy to pissy and angry all of a sudden- Must be on my period again gaiz ! xD Gah ! D=< 
Haha , I'm just a little curious . Since both myself and my spouse in FrontierVille are guys , and you can apparently have kids in it no matter what , makes me wonder A . How in the heck are we gonna get a kid , and/or , B . Which one of us is magically preggers ? xDD\ 
\ 
( P.S. I'm officially broke on their now . I spent all my money on paths and flowers . Seriously , I have ZERO coins left . xDD ) 
Dear 3 AM Feeling , \ 
It has come to my attention that you're a < PROPMALE > pain in the arse , and that you love to torture people . You even have the power to make something this lame seem funny at times . So , I will kindly ask you to fall in a hole , and get eaten by rabid hankerchiefs , who would then be eaten by adorable gerbils . Thank you for your time , and please , go die . \ 
Your's truly , \ 
Your Own Personal Murderer ( D . J . S . ) 
OMG ! I was a semi-finalist in the Anthem contest ! =D I won $30 ! Thank you so much Mrs. Cuevas ! I couldn't have done it without you ! xD And don't worry , I know I'm making a big deal out of this . xD \ 
And speaking of her ... xDD I totally had a Cuevas Attack today ! I was watching Spirit , the one about the horse , and it hit me how the eagle was freedom and how it was just out of reach of Spirit for the longest time ! xD 
Spent the last night over at < PROPMALE>'s house . Had fun making s'mores with him and Katy . ( Spelled her name wrong . xD ) Watching some shows , and generally had a good time . xD 
So , who else is looking forward to bandcamp where it's supposed to feel in the god-awful 90's and hopefully rainstorms on Tuesday and Wednesday ? xD I hope for the rain , not for the heat . D= We're all gonna die . ;_; xD 
My mom is staying up later than I can manage , I feel very ashamed now . D= Darn band camp , wearing me out with your sunburns ... and marching . Gah ! D8 xD Gotta clean the entire house tomorrow ( Erm ... Today ? xD ) because mom wants me to , even though she has the day off . xD [/Fail Post ] 
Went to the fair today with mom . It was so pathetic . xD When we got there they didn't have even half of any of the rides set up at all , game booths weren't ready until 4 . We basically ate some food and circled the fairgrounds twice , then left . xD One thing though , I think I know how the Carousel works now ! O= ' Twas very interesting . xD 
-Knows he just left a status an hour ago- Yay ! Tomorrow , if things are still going on , gonna < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST > Krudwig and maybe go to the fair to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > Snyder too . Let's hope it all works out ! xD G'night y'all . =P 
So , wore a dress the other day ( which gave me hot flashes I swear ) , then pranced over to < PROPFIRST>'s that same night to < PROPFEMALE > out . xD Finally back home , just listening to my weird music . xD 
Got a new computer today because our old one stopped working .. like completely ... Couldn't even log on . xD Sounds vaguely familiar to that refridgerator story from Spring . xD It's Windows 7 ! =D 
Alright , I promised to show this twisted song at some point . xD So here it is in all it's strange < PROPFEMALE > , catchy , depressing and happy at the same time ! =D What's not to love ? O= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF_IBrHsuzA 
I'm back ! =D I had a great time up in Mackinac ( Pronounced Mack-in-aw for you out-of-staters . xD ) Got quite a bit of fudge and gonna stuff my face full eventually . xD Rode on a horse carridge , got lost for a bit , and looked at the < PROPFEMALE > of the < PROPMALE > Fitzgerald . O= Quite interesting . xD 
Ah , had fun playing tennis with Jesus , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > . xD Even though < PROPFIRST > nailed me in the throat with a ball , I'm still fine . xD Then after we got too tired , we ended up playing Uno , and I actually won , along with < PROPFIRST > ! O= Good times . xD 
Haha , had a fun time playing tennis with all my friends at < PROPFEMALE > . xD Almost got killed a few times , but it's fine . =P Gonna play volleyball tomorrow , I think . xD ( Mini-Rant Alert ! OMG ! RUN ! ) Also , why is it that when people say they're in relationship they don't put who ? xD Are they too embarassed of the person they care for , or are they just desperate for attention ? ( Sorry if that offends anyone . D= ) 
So , I decided that for the first time since school's started , I wouldn't get a shower in the morning and right after school , so I just got one this morning . After I get home , I decide to do the dishes to help her out , and wouldn't ya know it , no water , whatsoever , period . xD Bet she'll enjoy hearing that . =P Guess that's what happens when I try being helpful . xD 
Bah , anyone wanna do anything Friday night ( though we have the football game ) , Saturday or Sunday ? Spend the night or throw a mini-party or something maybe ? Mom's gonna be outta town and I'm gonna be bored to tears . xD 
Had a good night yesterday . Went to a party , got to pet kitties and show my friends Desperate Housewives ! =D Had to get a ride home from < PROPFIRST > Collins s and we spent the time watching newgrounds vids and more desperate housewives until I passed we passed out at around 6 or 7 AM . xD Good times . =P 
Today was almost what I could consider a perfect school day ... until school ended . So , no one try and tick me off , please ? =) 
is so tired he can barely stay awake .. I hate school , and homework ... mainly homework . D= That stuff can go die in a hole and get eaten by rabid hankerchiefs . =) 
Wow , first time I'm heading to bed before 1 AM in about two weeks now . O.o 
Dear Computer , \ 
I'm going to be honest , I'm not fond of the way you randomly change the size of text for no reason , and I have no way to change it back . It makes me upset and unhappy . I don't like it when you try and change the way I see things , so if we can work this out , everything'll be fine for us . We'll figure this out . =D I still love you dearly Compy . <3 \ 
Sincerely , \ 
< PROPMALE > Skriz 
\school is offically gayy !! lol\ " \ 
Haha , thanks everyone for the birthday wishes ! You're all magically fantastical ! <3 -Hugs- 
\A 13 year old boy in Texas shot himself\ 
Going to do laundry now , Mom has to work tomorrow . Can't wait for my party ! Gonna have a good time with friends , and I hope they'll enjoy it too ! =D And I'm hoping to get back in time to talk with my < PROPFIRST > Strand ( Davey <3 ) . Oh , and I can't wait for my Birdeatsbaby album and T-shirt ! =D ( I hope to get it in a few days ! =D I'll make you all listen ! >=D And their new EP comes out on Sunday too !! =D ) 
( Second post of the day . OMG ! O= ) It almost makes me cry . I was at the laundremat , and I see this kid who's six , maybe seven . I hear a noice and he whips out his iPod and starts texting ... Not only does it make me sad that kids are texting like teens , but also that I don't have one of those freakin ' iPods ! 
Is so nervous about his party that he's throwing because he's never had one with over two people before in his house . He also hopes that he doesn't bore everyone to tears , which could very well happen . xD 
declares < PROPFEMALE > to be awesome !!! 
Ah , had an awesome time yesterday with all my friends ! xD < PROPFIRST > and I had a fun night too , music ftw . <3 xD And now .. I get to go to a choir concert in a half hour .. oh joy . xD 
I wish there were more hours and the day and two or more of me . I need one for my friends , one for my homework , one for my internet friends , one specifically for < PROPFIRST > . So exausted , I need a vacation . 
muhahahahaha hacked D-skriz's < PROPFEMALE > !!!! :) - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Coryell 
hacking < PROPMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > yet again !!!!!!!!! :) - < PROPFEMALE > 
Now I'm hacking his < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! -Anonomous .... Haha jk it's < PROPFIRST > :D 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice -people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE \ 
and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ? 
Hmm , I feel like changing my status . Everything needs changed eventually . =) 
Hmm , I still have the right to be a bitter , selfish , twit for a little bit right ? =P I just have to say that this song is surprisingly accurate . http://birdeatsbaby.bandcamp.com/track/seventeen =) Don't worry , I'll probably come to my senses by tomorrow and take this down . But Birdeatsbaby does know how to make one feel better . xD 
I woke up today feeling fantastic , and I'll be darned if I didn't have one of the best days ever ! xD Everything went fine ! =D And guess what I just got ! >=D I just got a package from \The Nest\ " ( Birdeatsbaby ) with two CD's and shirt ( which I'll be wearing tomorrow by the way . =P ) What a day ! I'm so giddy ! <3 " 
Haha , interesting day . Pretty stop and go . Good and bad , and that such . =P Well , that is until we tried to do dishes ... Oh my gawd ... I seriously don't know what to say about trying to unclog the kitchen sink with a plunger . It was hilarious and terrifying at the same time . =P Ah life , you do like to keep things interesting . <3 
Gonna get dressed up tomorrow at school to celebrate Halloween ! =D Anyone with me !? =D It'll be fun , I swear ! But for tonight , I guess I'll just suffer and do tons of homework . =) 
-Sigh- Why is it that the days my phone's on vibrate , and I don't check it , are the days when I get calls from people saying that I have to call back ASAP ? xD It sucks , that , and your internet doesn't work either when you're getting creeped out by shows on TV . =P 
Ha , gonna be home alone tonight , well at least for awhile I guess . Mom's heading out , so will probably just enjoy a nice quiet evening . xD 
Remember , remember , the 5th of November . 
I hate research essays ... Finding four seperate sources when you could probably just use wikipedia alone is annoying . xD Oh , and a head's up . Probably won't go to any parties if they pop up this weekend . Already have stuff planned . Gonna catch up with someone , well , as soon as I ask my mom . xD 
HAHA ! Take THAT Cause & Effect Essay ! I just finished you , yeah ! >=D It only took a few cups of Mt . Dew , five days of procrastination , and Wikipedia ! But you're done ! > D Now ... just to do dishes . D8 xD 
Had an interesting weekend over here . Gonna be picked up any minute . Wonder what I'll do then ? O= 
Aye , guess I missed Cici's birthday party . D= Just got my phone charged since it's been dead all weekend . And here I got my hopes up for her party . xD 
Had an awesome day today , well beside school of course . Show went fine , harassed < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , talked with < PROPFEMALE > Bingner about all sorts of fun , then got a ride with < PROPFEMALE > Shafer and < PROPFEMALE > . Oh my gosh .. hip hop , with those two , priceless ! xD And on the way home , I realized something , < PROPFEMALE > and I seem to have similar laughs . Kinda found that out when we couldn't stop laughing for like a mile or so . xDD 
Last show day ! Then cast party after that , so probably won't get home until late again . D= I have a crap load of messages and stuff I have to answer tomorrow , but at least I'll have time to do that . xD 
Lol Finally made a complaint about the news . \

Where's a snowday when you really need ' em ? Did the freshman forget to dance again ? xD Rhetorical questions are fun , aren't they ? Did I forget anything ? Oh , everyone who sees this will have a good day , right ? xD 
To all you haters of Christmas music and everything it stands for , please look down at my post below . =3 \ 
YES !! School just called and guess what ? NO SCHOOL !!! YAYY !!! <3 
Ah snowday , how badly I needed you . xD Got up an hour ago which is nice . Probably gonna be board , but I can live with that . =P

Had a pretty good day . Didn't get killed in Choir like I thought I would . Didn't have to take a test in English , well , today at least , and my speech went somewhat okay . xD What to do now ? Well , I'm thinking of celebrating the winter break on Friday . xD 
Watched most of the Young American's video yesterday , ' twas interesting . =P Don't really know what to do today . Kind of bored . xD 
The concert was fun ! =D Got lost with < PROPFIRST > Collins in < PROPMALE > . Somehow ended in the complete opposite direction we were supposed to . xD Spending the night now . =P 
Sigh , not tired whatsoever . D8 Suuuccckss . xD Oh , had a good time at < PROPFIRST>'s . FINALLY doing a little okay at the game he has . Got my present ( Higurashi 6 disc set ) but mom won't let me open it . D8 And eating carrots right now . So .. yeah . =) xD 
[ poke ] me if you ever had a crush on me . \ 
[ like ] this status if I'm a good friend . \ 
[ message ] me if you ever wanted a relationship . Shh , I won't tell ! \ 
[ comment ] on this to share a great memory . \ 
Why not ? Might as well do one of these at some point in time . xD 
Even though everyone else is doing this too , I wish everyone a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and possibly a happy new year too in case I don't get on in between then ! xD 
Haha , this really put me in a good mood , it's so odd I love it ! xD ( Check the link below . O= ) 
I love being in such a happy and optimistic mood . It's the kind where even if you make a mess , hit your elbow , and stub your toe within a minute that you're still happy . xD 
Not one of my proudest moments today ( which has just begun by the way . xD ) I went to grab a fork when washing the dishes for fun ( sick , I know ) and I grabbed the sharp end of a steak knife . Don't worry , I'm not bleeding , the steak knife wasn't hurt , and I'm still happy . =3 
< PROPMALE > !!!!!!! I WUV YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
Had an interesting few days . xD < PROPMALE > out with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > after the Higurashi Party , which we finished , < PROPFIRST > stayed another night , had fun with Resident Evil games . xD Then I got a call at 9 something from Jazzy and we went to see Tron , which was actually pretty cool . O= Now just waiting for Emi's party . =D 
Since everyone else is talkjng about the new year , and I'm killing time right now , might as well wish the calendar a happy birthday since it'll be another year older soon . xD 
So .. been busy worrying about homework in practically all my classes . But took a little time to chat with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > on FB , which their chatbox apparently doesn't like sending messages to < PROPFIRST > . =P Makes me sad I can't even be his servant . And yadda yadda yadda . =3 
About ready to go to bed , after I finish my chocolate ice cream ( comfort food ) . xD I needed it . Setting up for a dance I'm not going to doesn't seem as fun as you might think . =) 
Just got home . Was over at < PROPFIRST>'s house until 11:30 when we had to go clean up after the dance that we didn't go to , then stayed until 1 until < PROPFIRST > took me home . What else will happen this weekend , who knows ? xD 
I know it's going to be a good day when school's closed . =D 
I love how even though we have school today ( with my mom calling me and telling me the roads are worse than yesterday apparently ) , the school website says that school's closed because of icy conditions . xD 
Hearing about Jazz Fest was amazing . :) 
HACKED BY < PROPFEMALE > ! 
hacked by mckie j 
hacked by < PROPFEMALE > and brain and < PROPFEMALE > and brain mawhahahahahaha 
< PROPMALE > is like super awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!! him and his higurashi :) 
Had an awesome day watching anime . Higurashi is fun with Rhinnon and < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . =P Now I'll be watching a different anime that was just sent to me tonight . xD 
If you need to get ahold of me ( today ) , don't FB , make sure to call , since I'll probably be sleeping in late . xD 
Hey , since I have to go to school tomorrow because of Mr. Rudland wanting a rehersal , is there anyone who has to/wants to go to school tomorrow and < PROPFEMALE > out during the 6th hour exam ? xD 
Don't bother texting my phone or calling me for a short while . I don't have a single minute left . 
Got back from S&E and got my first blue medal ! =D Today's been a mixed bag , wonder what'll happen next ? XD 
I just realized something , unless she has Econ 1st hour , I'm not going to have fun with < PROPFIRST > Dapprich in the early morning . D= How depressing . xD 
Haha ! Just got the call ! Not school ! Yipee ! Now to sleep in . =) 
I have a feeling that today will be a day of < PROPMALE > clutziness for me . Within the first 10 minutes of waking up I bumped the power strip in my room , turning off everything including my alarm clock , dropped a cap to my water bottle and couldn't find it , and slammed my nose with a freezer door . 
Despite it's somewhat intersting start with much clumsiness , this day didn't turn out half bad . xD Got a techical ' 1 ' for my choir solo and ensemble , and a good time with friends at the game , and ate a giant chocolate muffin . <3 Oh , and the car ride with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > was fantastic as well . xD 
Don't think I'll be able to make it to volunteer tomorrow . Mom's going outta state tonight so .. 
Gonna head to bed after an awesome day . Playing with Emi's toys , hilarious . The car ride to Ferg's ( especially with Jesus ) , priceless . < PROPFEMALE > and I hustling < PROPFIRST > and Cici in pool , amazing . Sad that a few people couldn't make it to all of it though . ( Rhinnon , < PROPFIRST > , Stephie . ;_;) 
it took me about 2minutes to figure out this was not my facebook ... < PROPMALE > forgot to logout ! >:D - < PROPFIRST > - 
Exauseted . I think we should have a three day weekend very soon . Wait , do we ? Some weekend this month .. Oh , the one after this one maybe ? I don't know . Ah well , going to help with something tomorrow , can't remember the details . Good night everyone . Hoefpefully everyone can get some sleep . And no , I don't acare about the typos in this right now . =) 
Goodness gracious . Just took a look at my calander and it's not looking friendly . I'll have something going on every day after school except Monday , next weekend is choir fest , pre-festival concert for band March 8th with the festival for that the weekend after , then having choir trip the following weekend . Then let's add theatre which will start up shortly and go till April . Guess I'm gonna be busy . xD 
So , had a pretty good day . =) Got to delivery suckers , got out of Goverment for schedualing , ran face first into a wall , and got to see a puppy ! =DD Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day Everyone ! =D 
This was a first . I just realized a few minutes ago that I forgot to eat dinner . My tummy forgot to remind me ! xD 
Wow , this week is just being mean I swear . I hit my head on a wall yesterday , and I fall on ice twice today . Got a little cut up , but I'll be fine . Hope tomorrow goes better . 
Somewhat odd day . Got all my homework done , no homework over the weekend really , and going to see the JV play tonight . But , I feel slightly stuffed up , and a friend's going to options now , so he won't be seen as much . Blah ... 
My walls just started vibrating which made the wall-clock buzz . Freaked out ? You bet I am . xD\ 
Also , the play was fantastic ! =D Might go to it tomorrow too . =P Should grab some other people to take with ( though I'm sure < PROPFIRST > was going too . xD)\ 
So .. yeah , gonna get some sleep for once in a long time . xD 
So had an interesting day . Stilll need to finish our infomertial for Econ . Love all the snow we've gotten , and had an interesting car ride with < PROPFIRST > . xD 
Whoo ! No school tomorrow ! =D 
Just got home and got a shower , so now I need to get some food and work on econ garbage . xD 
So I wonder what the people who were saying school was going to be closed are thinking right now . xD And the weather channel says that most of the snow and freezing rain we're gonna get on Sunday's gonna melt quickly on Monday . How depressing . 
Why can't today be yesterday ? D= Yesterday was fantastic , and because it's today , it means school's tomorrow . If it wasn't today , than school tomorrow wouldn't exist and I could sleep in . Bah , might as well start the homework I didn't do . xD 1 AM , here I come ! =D 
You know , it's so hard to focus on homework when you could be doing much better things like : hanging with friends , sleeping , watching TV , making a public speech , choking on a watermelon , roasting over an open fire , falling off a building , getting attacked by a lawnmower , and basically everything else that's possible or impossible . 
Hey Juniors ! Best wishes for the stupid , idiotic , and disgusting tests you'll be taking tomorrow along with yours truly . And to everyone else ... I hate you for having a day off . >> xD jk 
declares Steph awesome !!!! 
2nd day of ACT down . Doing something Saturday at sometime , but I don't know when . And tomorrow .. It feels like something's going on tomorrow , but I don't know what . xD 
So let me get this straight ... < PROPFEMALE > Grammer can end a 15 year marriage by phone ; < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on his ninth divorce ; < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage ; < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having affairs ; 53% of Americans get divorced ; and 30-60% cheat on their spouses . Yet , same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you find this ironic . 
I still don't feel like going to bed . D= I blame < PROPMALE > for my lack-of-sleepiness . Why must weekends only be 2 days long ? xD 
Don't worry school , one day you and I will get along . Sure , that day may be graduation , but that's besides the point . =) 
Hmm , debating whether or not to listen to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Fleming by wearing a tux tomorrow . On the one hand , it's really uncomfortable , on the other , it'd be interesting to see some of the choir people freak out ( that'd be mean xD ) . \ 
Don't really feel like doing homework . Wish I had the new Pokemon game . Generic comment , generic comment , etc . I'm ranting like the book we're reading in government does . xD 
Can't believe I'm actually going to do this . Well , mostly . xD The closest thing I have to a real tux is my choir uniform , so here goes . xD Band concert tonight , along with parent teacher conferences and play practice , yay . xD 
YES !!! Got an A- on my test in Econ ! 40% of my grade saved ! xD Band Concert went alright , some reading homework , but that's it . Going to go to bed before 12 tonight , hopefully . xD 
Got Pokemon Black and White today ! So happy ! =D Didn't get any homework tonight either ! Today was a good day . =) 
Screw you daylight savings time . I'm gonna be grumpy and tired tomorrow because of you ... or I could always just say that I ' accidently ' forgot to put my clocks forward and miss school . =P Let's all move to Arizona where they don't believe in changing time . =) 
Well , started reading my 150 < PROPFEMALE > book at around 11 , with a few distractions of course , and was so into it , I finished it . Looking up from it , I realize it's 2:15 , and I'm only just slightly tired . If only all the books we read were even half as interesting as this book . School , I don't know if I'm ready for you or not . 
is soooo sleep deprived that EVERYTHING is amazing , which means , I'm so slow and everything surprises me that it's not even funny .. Actually , it's hilarious ! =D 
I hate it when < PROPFIRST > Dapprich is right . >> I'm so tired I'm having moodswings , most of them hatred-wise . And I won't get much sleep tonight either . So , if I looked pissed tomorrow , don't piss me off more . I really don't wanna get in trouble for setting your tongue on fire or putting a needle into every one of your pores .. But if I'm not super pissy , everything should be fine ! =D 
Not going to school today . My sinuses are draining , or whatever , and I have a migraine , I feel really sick and like I'm gonna die . It's only a Wednesday , so I hope I don't miss anything uber important . Night everyone , hope you have an okay day . 
Just woke up because of a text . Of course it would be that the first day I stay home sick ever , < PROPFIRST > Krudwig shows up to school . > < That's called awful timing . Hope you feel happy about that sinuses or whatever has me feeling like this . >> I'm doing a little better though , so by the time school starts tomorrow , I should be fine . xD I hope .. 
To mourn the loss of my cold weather , I'm wearing snowflake pj's . xDD 
Mom is watching Jersey shore , and I can't focus on homework when I can see stupidity in action . xD 
Got straight 1's at band festival , had a party on our bus ride back , and just had a good time . =P This weekend's going to be busy . ( Oh , also , apparently Facebook changed stuff ... again ... Just keep it the same please , or at least add a ' dislike ' button first . >>) 
Long , tiring , busy weekend . Had fun enough , but I need an actual break on weekends . xD 
Tonight is Sunday , so that means that tomorrow Facebook will be aflame with all of the burning rants about how much people hate Monday . Many will be clever , most will be liked , but all of them will be completely justified . 
I don't want tomorrow to come , not because of school , but because I think the world needs to slow down . It's impossible to make the best of each day when so little time is given , and one cannot spend time doing what they love when it is sapped away by pointless , trivial things . But enough . I should have been in bed hours ago . Good night all . 
Well , this is going to be interesting . Mom just found her tracfone after losing it awhile ago , and apparently there was a message and I have a dentist appointment tomorrow at three .. If only the phone was found sooner , and we hadn't lost the card with the date of the appointment . Looks like I'll be missing some of play practice .. Please don't kill me Mr. < PROPFIRST > Dyer ! D8 
Can't sleep for some reason . Probably too excited/anxious . Has an urge to learn Russian for some reason . 
Just got home , 2 and a half hours late . New York was definitely something , lots of things to do and see . But it's gonna be so nice to pass out in my bed . I wish Mr. Rudland would give us an excused absence tomorrow , or even permission to stay home . We're all exhausted and some of us ( including me ) or a little bit irritable since we haven't slept in a long time . xD 
Has a decent amount of homework tonight , and I don't feel like doing any of it . xD Spring Break can't come soon enough . Just two more days of school now . =) Will start playing Bass Clarinet in band again , I think , so that'll be an interesting change . Will miss sitting by < PROPFEMALE > , and getting a good view of < PROPFIRST > and his ... < PROPFIRST > -ness . xDD 
Just realized that I haven't made a status update in a week . Hmm . xD Well Spring Break has been kinda tiring but fun as well . Tomorrow will be the first day this break where nothing will be planned , and I'll be sleeping in my own bed and waking up with no one else in my house . xD
