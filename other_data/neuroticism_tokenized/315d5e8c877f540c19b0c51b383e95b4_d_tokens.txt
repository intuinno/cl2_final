-- Is it possible to know what you have when you have it ? 
Imagine a future moment in your life where all your dreams come true . You know it's the greatest moment of your life and you get to experience it with one person . Who's standing next to you ? 
Happiness comes in many forms -- in the company of good friends , in the feeling you get when you make someone else's dream come true , or in the promise of hope renewed . It's okay to let yourself be happy because you never know how fleeting that happiness might be .

How you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you 
The best thing about a paper jam is that it forces you to open up the machine and figure out what went wrong in the first place 
Tell me what you like , I like what you tell me and if you understand me then you can overwhelm me
