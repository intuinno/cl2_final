You know , I've always heard people say some terrible thing happened for a reason . And you know , that's bullshit . Terrible things don't happen for a reason , they just happen . And there's no rhyme or reason , and those of us left have to figure out how to go on . . .

Surfin ' the net at 34,000 feet .

I'm in Philly . Bartenders here struggle with Tanq & Tonic just like they do in Texas . Tonic doe not equal Soda . Period . And Tanq & Soda is just plain nasty . 
Fogo De Chao for dinner tonite . Wish we could've eaten at more Philadelphia type/owned/unique unto restaurants while we were here . . . 
There are a lot of peope needing to use the restroom on this flight . I don't think I've ever had to go to the bathroom so bad that I had to use the airplane toilet . . .

is glad to be back home in Texas . . . 
Everytime I make boiled eggs I always think of that scene in < PROPFEMALE > Quimby Age 8 where she goes to crack her egg on her head but it's raw instead of boiled . . . 
Waiting . . . 
To whatever reporter it is that asked the models of < PROPFEMALE>'s Next Top Model the question about it being okay with using race as a costume - duh . As a bi-racial person , I can personally atest to race being the ultimate costume . And I would assume , it is so for non-mixed races too , including the majority race . . . What a dumb subject matter . 
Once again glad to be back in the state of texas . . . I'll post pictures soon . 
Nothing like accoustic brazilian music to set the mood for a monday . . . 
Okay , pictures have been posted and now I guess I should completely unpack because I'm not going anywhere else until Thanksgiving . . . 
is looking forward to this weekend . And sadly , it's only Tuesday . . . 
omg nanowrimo is taking forever to load today . . . sheesh . . .

I will then slowly get ready to go walk the land , maybe kill some vermin and then come back inside to eat delicious leftovers . I will not be shopping . I won't even be able to get online . And I'm just fine with that . 
cat + dog = 1 . cat barfs up hairball , 2 . dog tries to eat said hairball before I can get back with a towel , 3 . shoo dog off to clean the rest of cat barf up 4 . dog barfs up the eaten cat barf 5 . cat checks it out but then thinks better of it

Chocolate oatmeal cookies in the fridge setting and dinner in the oven = happy smells ! 
Hulot is terrified of the sad collapsing snowmen dotting the property , especially the one that had potatoes for eyes , orange slices for ears , an apple slice for a nose and celery for buttons ( but the raccoons kinda took care of most of the food and it does kinda look a little scary with all the raccoon tracks and missing bits of food ) . . . 
Tying a ribbon around my dog while the cat is feisty surely gains me entry to hell . But man if it isn't funny !!! 
Did laundry , < PROPMALE > up pictures , cleaned out my son's closet and cleaned the cat box . There , I've been productive today ! 
Yay the carpet cleaning guy is here !!! 
Phone is dead and will be dead for awhile . With my acrylic nails I can't open the little charger thingy . . . < PROPFIRST > , I need you ! 
I'm sorry Mr. Adult Rock tv station , but I've listened to a lot of < PROPFEMALE > Joplin , and I've listened to a lot of The Grateful Dead , and aside from the fact that both have anti-establishment lyrics and both were heavly influenced by 12 bar blues , they are NOT similar . Geez . . . 
* sigh * 322 more days until we go back to Hawai'i . . . 
This whole time I thought it was the malted milk eggs that made my easter basket smell good as a kid - it's not !!! It's the plastic grass stuff !!! It smells like malted milk eggs . . . And no I'm not suffering from phantosmia ( well not right now anyway ) . 
It is a beautiful morning !

A true friend doesn't care what you're wearing , if your home is tidy or not , if your car is making funny noises , that you only have $5 in the bank this week , or that you and your loved ones aren't perfect ... A true friend just loves you for you ! Repost this if you have at least one true friend . 
I love my husband - he's the bestest husband in the world ! 
* < PROPFEMALE > sigh * 
has no < PROPFEMALE > to work out today . . . so , I've been sitting on the balcony reading most of the morning . . . 
Does anyone know where I can find the CURRENT health < PROPMALE > that's being considered ? I've checked all my usual spots , and none of them have anything newer than a January date , or is one of the older ones still being considered ? 
You know in some countries conversations about sex aren't taboo . . .

Doesn't feel so good now . . . 
As much as I drive , I see lots of dead animals on the road . . . The ones that give me pause for thought are the dead oppusums . . . The other animals just barely register , but the dead oppusums break my heart completely . . . They just look like they were in agony when they died . . . 
Happy Pi Day !!!! 
is currently readin , \Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter . \ " Love it so far . One of the best things I've ever bought at < PROPFIRST>'s . "

Free to good home ( or hell just a home ): One 12 ( twelve ) pound lump of fur that likes to drink out of toilets , leave < PROPFEMALE > paw prints on fresh clean stoves and countertops , gets stuck under the kitchen cabinetry , runs burms around the house at 4am and thinks eating the side of the couch is the highlight of her day .

I love my mom . I love my aunts . I love my grandmas . I'm very lucky to have all of them still alive and in my life on a pretty consistent basis . I think I take that for granted - that they are all still there , these wonderful women who inspire me , who make me think , who make me appreciate what I have , who remind me that I have a connection to my youth . 
One day my heart won't stop when I see someone like you . One day my stomach won't flip when I hear someone laugh like you . One day I won't feel faint when I smell your cigarettes . One day , that's not today . Why , oh why do you still haunt me ? 
I love my nook btw . And Pride & Predjudice and Zombies is awesome !!! 
misses her < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . . .

Hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > !!!!

The national pork board ( yes thats a real thing ) decided today to move from the decades old slogan of ' the other white meat ' to ' pork : be inspired ' . Their marketing director said that to increase pork sales they needed to make \a more emotional connection to our product [ pork ]' . "

if you have at bat 11 dont try to watch the game and listen to the radio broadcast . . . there's an almost 3 minute delay . =( 
It amazes me that people will bid on stuff 10x the amount they could get it for on the stuff's company's website . . . 
Dear Federal Government . You suck . Thank you . 
when in the course if human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the lawd of nature and of nature's god entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . 
Alas it's time for night night if I think ' Pinturicchio ' is ' Pinocchio ' ; although , it was a funny mental picture . . . The disney character doing the fresco's in the borgia ( sp ? ) apartments with the cricket . . . Think about it - it's funny . 
I have now had THREE ( 3 ) employers to lower my standards/expectations . . . Apparently being driven , accountable in the work place and sassy are unwelcomed traits . 
Trying really hard not to be claustrophobic in the gas station car wash ...

Just in case anyone was wondering - oxiclean gets out blue gatorade/pizza/cinnamon muffin vomit from very light beige carpet ( the smell too ) . 
Dear < PROPMALE>'s - my husband respectfully asks that you do not put glitter in any of the egg dye kits for next year . He is not enamored the way I am with sparkly eggs , cats , dogs , carpet and hair . . . Apparently getting glitter in your eye 1 time 50 years ago fosters an anti-glitter sentiment ( and our christmas time wedding contributed ) . However , I am grateful you packaged the glitter in such a precise delivery tube . 
I am not going to be abrasive today . \ 
I will remember I cannot change the world . \
