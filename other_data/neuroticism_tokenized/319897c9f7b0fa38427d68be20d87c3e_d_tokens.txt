Happy new year everyone . Hopefully 2011 will bring in better luck . 
You honestly don't realize what you have until it's gone , and you don't realize what you could have done better until the opportunity isn't in front of you anymore . 
Going to bed . I've got a lot on my mind and I can't wait to sleep it off . Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day . 
Yeah , I feel as though I've been hit with a < PROPMALE > truck :/ 
meh ... going to bed soon . working in the morning with Magi . Excited to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPMALE > on friday ! :D 
So tired .. 
tired ... and wicked sad .. :/

Working in the morning . 
i neeeeeed treats for petville ! send me one and ill send one back . 
I'm scared this may be the demise of our friendship ... :/ 
I didn't really know how much Magi really meant to me until tonight . I almost cried when she hugged me , aw , you know we're best friends now . 
hah . people are ridiculous sometimes . 
powers probably gonna go out soon . AWESOME ! > ( 
Ke$ha , did you know that brushing your teeth with < PROPFIRST > Daniels is probably the dumbest thing to put in a song . Stupid skank . 
Apparently I'm a liar and so is my best friend . If that's so why doesn't that person delete me from here , myspace , twitter , and formspring . 
what to do ? what to do ? 
D: WAHH ! going back to bed until Magi forces me up . 
Everything in life is based on a bet , and once you figure that out , you learn not to expect anything from anyone . 
listening to breaking < PROPMALE>'s dear agony cd . :) 
im sick sick sick . :( meme's got surgery tomorrow afternoon , wish her luck ! 
Soooo tired , but I'd be screwed if I went to sleep now . So ... trying to keep myself occupied until around 2 ... which is 6 hours away . 
Watching Orphan ... you'd figure since this freakin chick pisses me off so bad that I'd stop watching it , but nope . Seriously if I were the mother of these kids , < PROPFEMALE > would have been back at that adoption agency . 
watching Tough Love Couples :) 
Just barely finished cleaning my room . awesome , now I'll sleep till 3 in the afternoon . > / 
I had a dream I could fly from the highest swing , I had a dream . 
not a happy camper ... 
I should be sleeping ... 
hiccups are a bitch 
just now going to bed ... awesome . 
listening to blue oyster cult , it always calms me down . 
i should really be unpacking and organizing my room , but i don't wanna without magi :( 
IPOD JUST POOPED THE BED !

BROTHERS\ 
WEEK ... If you have A brother who has made you laugh .. Pulled your \ 
hair .. Stuck up for you .. Drove you crazy .. Hugged you .. Watched you \ 
succeed .. Saw you fall .. Picked you back up .. Cheered you on .. Made you \ 
strong .. Can't do without .. Copy and paste this into your status .. 
It's weird getting older and seeing how much things change , especially when you don't go to high school anymore . 
just figured out that my kitten is not a girl ... * cough * oh boy ... well his name is now Orion . 
Changed < PROPFEMALE>'s name yet again . Orion just didn't suit him . Now it's Cosmo , because he really is a twit hahaha . 
i\ 
pretty much feel like ; a germ that went on steroids and turned into a \ 
super germ , just jumped into my body and make me an irritable , and \ 
miserable Ashie . Might go to bed soon . 
Excuse me , Nose ; Could you please pick whether you want to run or clog . You're confusing me . 
Earthquake ? In NH ? and that bad ? Wow . Everyone okay ?? 
Breathing is hard today . I really hope to get over this soon . 
I like it on Magi's recliner . 
chicken nuggets , sponge < PROPMALE > squarepants , riker , and the animals . hopefully it'll be a good night . i'm excited to see meme tomorrow .

alone , put in minority , and so much else , all for something they didnt \

T.I. on a Saturday afternoon :) . Gonna be at DD's later with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? and Magi Fournier . and a few others I think . 
not a happy girl right now . 
Up too early for my liking , shower , then off to Rockingham . 
It's one of those moments when I feel like everything is amazing and will be okay . The puzzle is coming back together , and the colors are starting to blend in the right ways . \ 
Oh and just a side note . Listening to someone hiccup while they sleep puts hiccuping on a whole new level haha . 
Well now that my stomach has rejected everything I've tried to eat tonight .. I think I'll try sleep . :/ 
Betrayal is the best way to say , \Screw you ! \ " It really get's the point across . " 
I can't even fathom what is going on right in front of me . I wish I could tell the truth about how I really feel , but what good is it going to do in the end ? 
I've realize that I'm going to be the lady that never falls in love , and has a thousand cats . I just haven't gotten used to the thought of my dreadful , and depressing future yet . 
Paranormal Activity 2 was creepy , I'll give it that . But I won't be losing any sleep . 
Awake with massive amounts of anxiety . I'm getting surgery in 31 hours D: 
I just have to \ 
keep telling myself that it's not going to be forever . Everything ends \ 
at some point . And then I won't feel this way anymore . 
I just watched footage from 9/11 for the first time since it actually happened . Back then I was too young to understand what was actually happening . After seeing that , I really don't know what to think about humanity . I truly don't believe that we were put on this Earth to make war . We were put here for a reason . And I plan on figuring out what that reason is before I die . 
I'M SORRY , but you CANNOT make < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Juice unless you are < PROPMALE > nie Magro . #justsayin 
< PROPFEMALE > nervous i still haven't slept ... 
Well they were right when they said I'd be an emotional wreck after I got my teeth out , but I'm only crying because it hurts . 
Mouth is killin me tonight , probably has to do with the fact that Magi is here and we're chatting it up . Watching Jersey Shore with the wife <3 
its weird to touch the back of my jaws with my tongue and not feel any teeth poking out :D still a little sore today , not as swollen , but bruising . Oh well , it's a sign of healing right ? :) 
heating pad , ice pack , and magi . THREE BEST FRIENDS ! 
nauseous , gonna try to go back to sleep . 
headed to bed . it's funny how much faster you fall asleep when you're healing up from surgery isn't it ? jeez . haha . 
TANOREXIC ! 
just got home from the hospital , and i'm not in the peachiest of moods . going to bed . 
Hair , makeup , laundry , then I don't know . I can not wait until our washer/dryer is hooked up , upstairs . 
Here's to your perfect weapon , \ 
Crack bones with blind aggression , \ 
Like birds whose wings are broken , \ 
You live without direction . 
Listening to Good < PROPFEMALE > . 
Watching \Yes Man\ " makes me feel so good about myself for some reason . " 
Waiting for < PROPMALE > Therrien and Magi Fournier to get here . 
I don't wanna live this life without you , I don't wanna spend the night without you , I don't wanna know what it's like , I can't dream without you . 
Your past is your past , you can't change it . But your future is forever , you decide what you want out of it . 
Happy veterans day to all the vets out there . Thank you for everything you've done for this country . 
I'm going to miss you < PROPFIRST > Westgate Thank you for everything you're about to do for our country . You're a brave man . We love you , come back safe . 
Not feeling very well at all . :/ Hopefully alka seltzer will help ? Ugh .. 
Maybe it's not my weekend , but it's gonna be my year . 
Not feeling well . 
I'm still awake ... 0.0 \ 
And now convinced that I'm an insomniac . 
Someone clearly shot me in the stomach just now . I feel like poo . 
It just hit me like a ton of bricks that you're really gone . 
For the first time in months I realize there's more to my happiness than you . 
Headed to bed ?? 
Just woke up , feeling like crap today :( 
Sir < PROPMALE > Tiberius Von-Lichtenstein = Mine and Magi's future mini Pomeranian . 
Change\ 
your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To \ 
not see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . Join the fight \ 
against child abuse ; copy & paste to your status and invite your \ 
friends to do the same 
I want to : Kick infections in the ba**s . 
Seriously , if anger could make one's ears bleed . I would have no blood left . 
Can you just stop talking please ? Because everything that your saying is making me want to harm you . 
This is LOVE MY SISTER week . If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you stumble , cheered you on and kept you strong , post this . A sister is a friend forever . Put this on your status if you have an amazing sister 
Shower , making myself presentable , then waiting for whatever happens . 
When I talk to you sometimes , it's like I'm talking to a brick wall . 
I pretty much feel like I'm < PROPFEMALE > ing the bubonic plague . Yet I still know that I have to do so much today . Hopefully my stomach will let me < PROPFEMALE > out my tasks . 
And so I'm told , I wear and I'm worn . 
I'm tired of these dreams :/ 
AKWARD ! 
I'll be your guardian angel , you're sweet company . No matter where I go I'll make sure you're all I see . 
Watching the Bounty < PROPMALE > . :) So far I loooove it . 
It is hotter than hell in my house right now D: 
My horoscope says I'm feeling very lighthearted today . Not . At . All . * rage * 
Everybody's having babies . So therefore , congratulations to all the new moms , and moms-to-be , and new dads and dads-to-be . I wish you all the best . :) 
On that note , I'm going to bed before I lose my mind on some bimbo I don't even know . 
Jensen Ackles could walk in my bedroom right now making a duck face and that wouldn't even help my mood . > ( 
Call off your dogs and leave me the hell alone . 
I feel like dirt :/ 
* bashes head against wall * I HATE SNOW ! D < 
Eating dark chocolate and wallowing in self pity . 
The butterflies in my stomach are beating me up . Stop being amazing !! :) 
Happy hoolidays :) 
Brutus got hit by a car tonight :/ 
I'm gonna be a serious buzzkill . RIP Brutus . 12/25/10 I miss you already old man ={ 
I need a serious pick me up right now :( 
Remembering all the people I was friends with back in elementary school , middle school , and high school kinda sucks ; Now we're all strangers . Despite all of this I'm happy with the ones I'm surrounded with . I couldn't ask for better people at my side throughout this rough time . Thank you everyone who has been there , I really appreciate all of you , even if I don't say it enough . You know who you are , I love you all . 
My cheeks hurt from smiling . :) 
Peppermint tea to sooth a sore throat ? Yes please . :) 
Break up already , wake up now\ 
Walk away , take it all back now\ 
Don't be quick to lick the scab off\ 
You're spitting in his face with the rest of them\ 
Chasm - Flyleaf\ 
Been stuck in my head for three days now . 
So sick , it's kind of ridiculous . :( 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Bourassa for letting me borrow the mini fridges !! :D 
It's just one of those nights . 
Bronchitis and a double ear infucktion ... again . Awesome sauce . 
I was hoping to watch an episode of Supernatural before the Nyquil kicked in , but it seems un-doable . :( 
P-A-R-T-WHY ?! BECAUSE I GOTTA ! 
Watching Celebrity Rehab with meme . \ 
at 3:13 a.m. We're cool . 
I have had Ain't No Rest for the Wicked by Cage the Elephant stuck in my head for four hours now . > ( 
People as dumb and idiotic as you literally make me want to vomit . 
MY EEEEARS ! 
Can't you see that it's just raining\ 
Ain't no need to go outside ... \ 
But baby , you hardly even notice\ 
When I try to show you this\ 
Song is meant to keep ya\ 
From doing what you're supposed to\ 
Like waking up too early\ 
Maybe we can sleep in\ 
I'll make you banana pancakes\ 
Pretend like it's the weekend now\ 
And we could pretend it all the time\ 
Ain't no need to go outside 
Yeah I've changed . Everyone changes throughout life . That's what makes us people , but what makes us human are our mistakes . I'm glad to know that I'm human rather than plastic , and I've accepted what I've done wrong . 
You're the best book I ever read . You're the smartest thing I ever said . <3 
What in the world happened to Lil < PROPMALE > ? Seriously . Nobody ever talks about him anymore . 
The thought of him gives me butterflies . 
How can happiness keep me up so late ? 
I still haven't slept yet ... but for whatever reason I can't stop thinking about just ONE thing . 
Finally tired enough to sleep , figures . Haha . 
Suddenly not very happy . Watching Supernatural with Magi . Trying to go to sleep at a reasonable hour . 
Come on baby , don't fear the reaper . 
All of these perfect relationships I'm seeing on here make me just a little bit sick . 
Meme : Don't forget to pick up the napkin mess . \ 
Me : IT WAS YOUR NAPKIN ! \ 
Meme : I don't care it's your son's fault . \ 
Me : He's your great grandson ! \ 
Meme : MY HIP IS BROKEN ! \ 
Me : NO IT'S NOT ! IF IT WAS YOU WOULDN'T BE WALKING , YOU'D PROBABLY BE DEAD ! \ 
lmao ! 
Untouched - The Veronicas \ 
Yeah , I'm pretty much in a fantastic mood . :D 
I'm glad that you can't actually explode from anger , because if it were possible I would have by now . 
Not sure how I feel about today . I cannot wait till the tax returns come in , because spending a couple days at the Spaulding Inn with momma is going to be amazing . 
You find a way to ruin everything . Thank you for everything you've managed to ruin . 
AGH ! Getting the icicles off the roof turned out to be an olympic event . Smashed my wrist and did a split due to the ice . Then I fell right into a snowbank ... awesome . At least Magi and I got intense laughter out of it . 
Watching < PROPMALE > maybe ? Never seen it ... 
Leave it alone , because the life that you save might be your own . 
If Red Bull gives you wings , then I should have a 25 foot wing span ! Grrrr . 
Seems like everything you say to me today either makes me feel belittled , or just plain stupid . \ 
Ignoring my phone , and watching Supernatural until I pass out . 
5 x-rays later ... and I still don't know what's wrong with my back . 
No matter where I go , you'll always know where I'm from . 
GAH ! I despise yawning . Bedtime for me was four hours ago but eh ... now i go to bed . :) 
The thermometer in Magi Fournier ' s car got to -9 F D: It's fuggin cold in heahhhh ! 
:/ I hate the fact that I'm one of those people who is just never going to go anywhere in life . And I know that I'm not . I'm going to be just like her . 
Bed , feeling pretty accomplished . Hangin out with the padre tomorrow .. er ... Today . :) 
I love being the last one to fall asleep , only to wake up every ten minutes , then the first one to wake up ... now what ? 
feeling a little bit better , but still as though i have a rock in my stomach . 
Shower , getting ready , then to the 99 for Meme's birthday dinner . :) 
suddenly really tired . :( i might miss supernatural . D: 
dreading going to the store tomorrow . gotta do some pre-superbowl shopping . If I don't make it out of the store alive you all should know that I love you . 
I'm miserable with the way things are here . Why did I think things would be different ? 
Snow and ice slid off the roof from above my bedroom . I nearly peed myself because it sounded and felt like another Earthquake . 
Am I just like you ? All the things you do ... 
I never thought I'd say this , but I wanna go to Prom this year ! Really bad ! 
Nice to see Zeth Ragusa sittin across the living room hahah . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ragusa is somewhere around here . Becka < PROPFEMALE > Landry is heah ! HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU BECKA < PROPFEMALE > LANDRY YOU . 
I used to love having a little brother . And At times I still do , just not when he decided that he doesn't want to listen to me . And slams and locks his door . He learned how to lock his door way too early . 
Feels like I've been punched in the jaw . The left side of my mouth hurts really bad . 
I didn't realize how much I really hate < PROPFIRST>'s day until tonight . 
Okay seriously , is there a point to this stupid freakin holiday ? Really ! 
Really wants to start breaking stuff . 
Supernatural , cube steak , mashed potatoes , and Cosmokitty . :) Starting to be an alright < PROPFIRST>'s Day after all . 
So < PROPFEMALE > McDonnell Magi Fournier < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Boz and < PROPMALE > made a bad night a really good time . \ 
I love my < PROPFIRST>'s Magi and < PROPFEMALE > :) 
I still think Cupid can shove his arrow where the sun don't shine . 
Methinks I want to see < PROPFIRST > Westgate SOON ! 
I was already upset about a number of things , but what I heard today truly broke me . 
Bad night turned into a pretty okay one . 
Tiredd . Can't wait for bed . Tomorrow should be another good day :) Not sure about Friday , then Shell on Saturday with my lady . :) 
dying of heat D= 
You know I'm from New England when I think 50 degrees F is warm :) love it . 
Guess who finally finished algebra and passed ! :D 
Well my normal sleeping schedule went out the window . Urgent care center later if this doesn't get any better :/ 
Not feeling right .. 
Another 24 hours and I get this stupid wic taken out . Thank God ! 
I really hope this goes away ... 
\Charlie Bit Me\ " is still my favorite video ever ! " 
I'm yawning too much for my own good . Goodnight everybody :) 
I don't know what to do ... :/ 
I am so looking forward to next Saturday , I can't freakin wait . 
Blueberry <- I hate that flavor :( 
Oh , you make me smile ! :) 
Finally got Riker to sleep . Talking to , well ... :) Bed soon . 
I can't freakin sleep :/ 
Stressed out . I hate living in this state . Where weather controls my life . 
Garlic Teriyaki Steak , Grilled Potatoes , and Salad . :) Dinner with the wife . 
It's crazy how meeting one new person can change everything . :) 
let me get this straight ... Kelsey Grammer can end a 15 yr marriage by phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , 53% of Americans get divorced and 30-60% cheat on their spouses . Yet , same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you find this ironic 
This party is crazy , but I'm glad I get to see it . So I know how I'm gonna be in 22 years lol . 
Definitely sad tonight . :( I love you < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Wheeler . \ 
At least she knew you loved her . 
* sad face * JAPANNNNNNN ! 
Gonna wear red today . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Westgate\ 
I miss you . 
Text REDCROSS to 90999 to donate $10 to the relief effort . the $10 is automatically added to your phone < PROPMALE > . :) The money prob won't get there until Japan officially asks for aid , but it's always good to donate to the Red Cross anyways . 
Magi Fournier And will you please ... for the love of God put on a f ****** shirt . \ 
lol 
If there was a dislike button on this website , I'd dislike you . 
Don't feel good at all . :( 
jackass 3d . < PROPFEMALE > ale . and the kitties . 
and my lap top cord pooped the bed .... cool 
Spread the fail whale\
