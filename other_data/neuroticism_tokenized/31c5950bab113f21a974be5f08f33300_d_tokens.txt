This planet has - or rather had - a problem , which was this : most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time . Many solutions were suggested for this problem , but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper , which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy ~ < PROPMALE > Adams
