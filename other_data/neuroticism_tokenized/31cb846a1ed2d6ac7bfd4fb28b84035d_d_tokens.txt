Bhagat Singh status ! People went to war with God on their\ 
minds and Taranasaz’s anthem of freedom on their lips brings tears to my eyes . \ 
He was one of the rare ones .. \ 
\ 
People deserve to be appreciated for their\ 
effort .. Take the time to thank someone for their kindness or hard work . 
“Inspired by the spirit of freedom , the < PROPFEMALE > for national\ 
self-determination , and being the son of\ 
General < PROPMALE > Wali Darwazee ( one of the < PROPMALE > supporters of constitutional\ 
monarchy in Afghanistan during the reign of < PROPMALE > Amanullah in 1920s ) , he\ 
supported the resistance movement during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . ” 
He has been very influential in shaping not only aged and\ 
modern day music but also the history of Afghanistan and the minds of its\ 
peoples . No ordinary man is capable of that ! 
TARANASAZ WAS A GENIUS ! And he deserves a lot more recognition ! \ 
a.k.a. Shah Wali Wali - His musical compositions have been performed by numerous Afghan singers , such as < PROPMALE > Zahir , < PROPMALE > Wali , Salma Jahani , etc . But I believe , in order to sing well or be a good singer , you only need a melodious voice/talent but to do what Taranasaz did , requires high intellect . The words he has written are < PROPMALE > ! 
Today is a great day :) 
Gurr !! 
:'( 
Where are them fireflies when you need them ?!

My mommy is the greatest !! =) ! 
Ahh ! Too many finals !! If I don't ace them all , I give you all the right to whoop me when you see me Lol 
How is it that people , so easily , take what they have for granted ? There are people in this world who haven't even seen a mattress let alone sleep on anything remotely close to one .. They would do anything to have what YOU have .. Shame on those who are too blind to see ...

Letting\ 
go doesn't mean we don't care or gave up . \ 
It means doing the hardest thing , to stop trying to do the impossible - controlling\ 
that which\ 
we cannot - and focus on what is possible - ourselves . It means accepting things that cannot be . It means maturing and moving on , no matter how hard you have to fight yourself to do so . 
So much work , so little time 
Its funny how someone who once told you they loved you , can ignore you like you never existed .. 
My first Afghan wedding . So far so good .. 
Its a girl !!!! =) !! 
A < PROPFEMALE > fell today ... No one so young and kind hearted should be subject to such a fate ... my inspiration when I was spent on the last < PROPFEMALE > of the never end 
ing research paper and could think no more .. My supply of energy when I was too tired to open my eyes in class .. You always knew what to say .. and at this 
moment I wish I did too .. You'll always be remembered .. 
Back on facebook =( She made me do it ! 
Wow .. The shit that just happened .... this is unbelievable ... 
Finally left the hospital ! And everything is going to be fine so thank God =) 
It was a good day =) 
Funny how people you're with always think you talk bad about them to your friends . People , friends were there before you and will be there after you . Friends know why your smiling and why your upset , before you tell them . If anything , the friends talk about you and its not because the friends hate you , its because they know their friends deserve someone who will treat them the way they deserve to be treated . 
What a great day ! =) Thank God . Things keep getting better and better ! 
Really enjoyed my morning jog in the park today . Day is off to a wonderful start =)
