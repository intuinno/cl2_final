Hate being up now ... but at least I get to look forward to spending the afternoon with my girlfriend again :] 
I don't want it to rain , but if it must ... please rain after I get to her place :] 
We may not be together anymore , but my breathing is still wacked because of you XD 
Tired and watching an awesome movie called Dogma . It's really cool ! It deals with the Devil , and God and all that stuff ... but with a funny/weird twist . It even features < PROPFIRST > and Silent < PROPMALE > .

I looked at our calls and saw her name ... this can't be good ... 
Lol , < PROPFEMALE > called my mom only to yell at someone in the background , I suspect it was < PROPFIRST > .
