I wish I had more potato soup :( 
Twenty weeks down :) 
Dad's home :) . Now these kids will start listening

RIP < PROPFIRST > . You were a great friend and a sweet and generous person . 
Got a 3 on the English AP test :) 
Bored . 
What kind of stupid idiot parks behind a car at Speedway , blocking it in , when they clearly have had to have seen ( since it was only three seconds from the time I got into the car , turned it on and got ready to back out ) the two people get in the car ?! 
Chinese class ends tomorrow . :[ . How sad . 
it's too early to be awake .

I hate funeral homes . 
I love my friends .

Just got home with Kierian . People can visit today if they like . :) 
Kierian will only take the dumb pacifier the hospital gave him , which is a pacifier for 2 months and older oddly . I have bought and tried like ten other pacifiers when his gets misplaced and he will not take them . Not even the infant MAM ( which is the hospital one ) that I bought . Finally though , we found the same exact one and he takes it !!!! 
Kierian has a cold :( 
Today , for the first time in six months , I was able to wear a pants that buttoned !!!

Ringing in the New Year at home with my hubby and my babies . < PROPFIRST > said he wanted to stay home and spend New Year's at home with his family . There is no one he would rather be with or no where he would rather be , he said . And I could not agree more ! <3 . Happy New Year everyone ! 
Laying on my side for too long still makes my hip hurt . Not as bad as it was when I was pregnant ; it just gets stiff now . Thankfully , no more shooting pain . Whew , pregnancy hurt . But , it was so totally worth it . Kieri is my everything <3

Apartment is half-way cleaned out . One more day of cleaning and it's ready for dry wall ! 
The \Who Views Your Profile\ " things are wack . They don't work . " 
My son has decided that he does not need sleep tonight . 
Ghost Hunters was pretty cool tonight , and I'm almost 80% sure my poor baby has started teething . He has all of the symptoms , and the baby orajel calms him down . My poor little guy . Two and half hours past bedtime and he's finally asleep . <3 
Just put my beautiful little Kieri to bed after his big sister helped giving him a bath . They are too cute <3 . Kierian's four month check-up is tomorrow . He's growng too fast . 
Kierian went to the doctor and Dr. Agan said he's perfect <3 . He now weighs 14lbs 12.5 ozs and is 25 inches long . < PROPFEMALE > went and helped with examing him . 
\How is it my fault ; you met her ten years ago . You know what I was doing ten years ago ? Being potty-trained . \ " Said I to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . ? " 
Has finally gotten Kierian to sleep . 
Just bought my son enough formula , diapers , and wipes to last him well over a month . ? 
Is an amazing mother to Kierian < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Murphy- < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , a grateful daughter to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Murphy and < PROPFIRST > Murphy , and a wonderful girlfriend to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Just put a couple of silly babies to bed . One decided that he would rather watch his mobile for half an hour than sleep , and the other keeps telling me she needs her dress , more chocolate milk , and to play . 
Will have a 1991 Buick Century with 30,450 original < PROPMALE > Monday morning . :) 
Is watching Blue's Clues with Kierian . ?

Kierian's baptism is Saturday , April 10 at Incarnation Catholic Church at 5:00 pm . All are invited and there will be a reception at < PROPFIRST>'s house afterward . Let me know if anyone needs directions =) 
Happy Birthday to me ! 
Kierian's baptism went very well last night . During the actual baptism though , the water got in his eyes and he was very upset and let everyone know about it . And today , he went to the zoo for the first time with < PROPFEMALE > and their grandparents and uncle while I worked . Maddy loved the \ephalents\ " and Kierian was excited about the wolf . My babies are too cute ? " 
loves < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > so much . ? 
was not pleased with the voice changes on today's new episode of Team Umizoomi . Neither was Kierian . The original voices had better be back for tomorrow's new episode because I am tired of watching the same ones over and over . 
At Kierian's six month check-up , he weighed 18 pounds 2 ounces and is 27 inches long . :) . 
There is no mistake that Kierian < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are siblings . Those two are the craziest sleepers in the world . 
Kierian is eight months old today ? 
is sick . :[ 
Babies are going to their Grammy's house while < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > takes me to see Eclipse . =) 
Did not get to see Eclipse . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > took me out to dinner instead since we missed the only showing we could get to . But , it was a lovely dinner ?. And on top of that , my car has tires now ! =) 
Busy , busy day . Cleaning and laundry . Taking the babies to Great-Grammy's house so Maddy can get her birthday present . Kierian is going to his Grammy's to spend the night . First time away from mommy =( . And tonight , going to movies to see Eclipse . Hopefully Miss Tanis Linnig comes along . Finally , back home to finish cleaning and do more laundry . 
Just got home from seeing Eclipse , and already missing my little baby . =( 
Survived my first night without Kieri . 
Maddy's birthday party ? 
Maddy's birthday party went pretty great today . I love my family ?. 
Has to go up to Bellarmine to write a statement for the Financial Aid office explaining to them that I am truly supporting a child . 
Went to Legendz Salon and Spa to get my hair trimmed/layered and back to red ! It's a dark red and it's gorgeouss . And on top of all that , I have FINALLY found a juice that Kierian will drink !!!! 
Is not even going to pray that the rain stays all day when < PROPFIRST > Linnig's is involved . It will be a beatiful , < PROPFEMALE > day when I go into work . :( 
Has the greatest father ( < PROPFIRST > Murphy ) in the world ! I love you dad !!!!!!!!!! 
Strangely , < PROPFEMALE > loves deep-fried salmon . AND .... KIERIAN IS GETTING A TOOTH !!!!!!!!! !!!

Kierian has his mother's attitude . 
< PROPFIRST > just walked in and handed me a bouquet of pink roses . ? I love him . 
Heaven help us , my dad is singing/screaming Metallica's One . 
Accomplishments , my ass . Let me tell you everything I've accomplished . I graduated high school with honors , I'm pursuing a degree in Spanish and Chinese . I'm working a full-time job , all the while raising TWO kids . I've worked hard for everything that I've gotten and will continue to work twice as hard for everything that I will get . No ultimatums for me . 
< PROPFEMALE > missed her little brother . Since she's been home , she's tried to hold him and when he moves away from here , she grabs him and tries to pull him back . 
Maddy had no accidents today ! And Kierian would not go to sleep until his mommy got home . ? I love my babies . 
My baby is nine months old today . Just three more months and he'll be a year . Where has the time gone ?! 
My baby did not want to cuddle this morning =( . He wants to hold a foam sword and yell at everyone . 
Shower and then going over to Tanis Linnig's . \ 
Partyyy 
< PROPFEMALE > just told me that she needed to get on facebook . 
is the best damn mother any child could ask for . 
Life is good today . 
My baby boy went to the doctor today . He is allergic to grass and smoke =( . 
A sweet life was ended today because someone else was texting while driving . Rest in peace , < PROPFEMALE > Ratliff . You were a beautiful young girl with a whole life to live and dreams to fulfill . Kierian is going to miss you . She was only eighteen years old . 
My beautiful baby boy is growing up too fast . At his nine month check-up , he weighed 21 lbs and was 29.5 inches long . He is 98% weaned from his bottle , and he's been saying \ba-ba\ " and \ " da-da \"." 
Desperately needs to go shopping for the kids . 
Has to have a Twitter account for Chinese . 
Getting ready to give the kids a bath , then dropping of my computer to Uncle < PROPMALE > Moore , and then Maddy , Kieri , and I are going to see Aunt < PROPFEMALE > Petty . :) 
The kids and I are staying home now . 
Rest in peace , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > . Say hello to Grandma < PROPFEMALE > for me .

the mother of a very whiny , very snotty baby today . Though I knew that this was coming since Maddy had an allergy flare up the other day , it is only fitting now that Kierian's allergies bother him . And on a different note , I absolutely despise modern < PROPMALE > . 5 days ?.

Was attacked by two monster babies only a short while ago . Kierian took me by surprise as he climbed up my back with his bowling-pin-turned-club while < PROPFEMALE > initiated a frontal campaign . 
My Scottish cousin < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Golike is here !! I've missed her so much ! 
Needs to step up her Chinese game .

Sometimes I really do not like Spanish . English and then Kierian's appointment .

Checking out the iPhone the husband just had to have . 
Kierian did really well this morning . Got to the Surgecenter of Louiville at 6:10 am and left at 7:40 am . He screamed the entire time afterwards while we we were waiting the half hour recovery time , but as soon as he was outside and in daddy's car , he was fine . He's been sleeping ever since . Poor little baby -he'll finally be feeling better now . 
More than ready for the weekend . While the husband works , Kierian and I are going to the Mama-in-law's tonight to write out invites and plan Kieri's costume party . Then , the rest of the weekend is devoted to studying and reorganzing . I have got to find some place for all fifteen pairs of < PROPFEMALE>'s shoes . 
Allergies :( . Kieri and Mommy feel terrible . 
Feels terrible . 
Is ready for October and all of the fun it entails : Aunt < PROPFEMALE > Petty's , Thirty-One Party , Huber's , and Kieri's 1st Birthday and Costume Party . :) 
Is ready for October and all of the fun it entails : Aunt < PROPFEMALE > Petty's , Thirty-One Party , Huber's , and Kieri's 1st Birthday and Costume Party . :) 
I'd rather be sleeping . 
I do not like my Chinese name . Should have stuck with the original one . Before , my name was an expression of elegance while walking down the stairs . Now , it literally means horse eight pens . 
One month from today I will wake up and cry because my sweet little baby boy will be a year old . 
Loves her family ! 
Hooray for the weekend ! Hanging out with Grammy and < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow , and Aunt Sa-Sa Sunday . 
As much as he annoys me , I love my husband sooo much <3 . 
If anyone needs any house repair [ i.e. drywall , flooring ( carpet , vinyl , laminate , hardwood etc . ) , painting , or any minor repairs , please let me know ! 
My car just hit 40,000 < PROPMALE > . 
Is never ever going to the west end branch of the Social Security Office again . 
Just one more day until Fall Break . 
Is doing some Chinese and thinking about how she does not want her baby to turn a year old . :( 
Getting < PROPFIRST > breakfast this morning because he works so hard fo us ! He was at work until 3 this morning , and he has to go back in an hour . 
Mommy-Daughter date tonight . Midnight bingo and then tomorrow , Thirty-One party . :) 
Is eating spaghetti with < PROPFEMALE > and Kierian and watching < PROPFEMALE > Kai-lan . 
I love my Grammy and I missed her so much when she was in Florida . Not looking forward to her selling her house :( 
Kierian now throws toys into the bathtub and tries to climb in after them :) . Excited for the weekend : Huber's and the zoo ! 
At Huber's with my family :) 
Sitting next to < PROPFEMALE > Miller in Pasteur . 
Its mommy week ... post on your status with the date(s ) you became a mommy ! Mommy to Kierian on October 30 , 2009 at 5:51 pm 7lbs 5oz , and Step-Mommy to < PROPFEMALE > on August 29 , 2008 she was 14 months old . I love my babies so much and would trade nothing for them !!! 
IF ANYONE HAS RECEIVED A FRIEND REQUEST FROM < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > DO NOT ACCEPT IT . IT IS NOT ME . IF YOU COME ACROSS THIS PROFILE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE REPORT IT AS A FAKE PROFILE . 
T.G.I.F. x 1000 
Kierian's has learned how to climb down from stuff . He also has learned if he stands on toys it helps him to climb up and out of stuff as well . The boy is the next < PROPFIRST > Pickles . 
Lovely evening with my boys . 
Put in several applications yesterday morning and I've already received two phone calls . Now , watching Letters To < PROPFEMALE > with my wonderful hubby :) . 
Took Kierian , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > to a trunk-o-treat tonight . Kieri looked so cute as a bumblebee . His birthday is in six days !! Home now to write a spanish paper . Excited about tomorrow --- wish me luck ! 
I got it :] 
If Letters To < PROPFEMALE > had been a book that they adapted into a movie , it would have been the best damn book ever . 
Starts orientation Monday !!! 
One year ago today I was at my ob/gyn getting ready to have an ultrasound when my doctor ordered me to the hospital to be induced . She did not tell me I would be in labor for 26 hours . But , it was all worth it :) . Leaving to pick Maddy up and then we are shopping ! 
Happy birthday to my beautiful baby boy . He is laying in bed with me and giving me kisses . I don't want him to grow up :[ 
< PROPFEMALE > got to trick-or-treat with both her brother and sister tonight . They had so much fun . Especially Kierian . Everytime < PROPFEMALE > was put in his bucket , he was all smiles . Maddy was scared of everything , poor girl . She ended up sitting in the stroller while I carried Kierian who wanted nothing to do with the stroller . All in all , it was a pretty great evening . :) 
Maddy and I were mad at Daddy this morning . When we told him that he needed his butt spanked , Maddy started chasing him around the room trying to spank his butt and saying \I have to spank your butt ... Daddy stop I have to spank your butt ... let me spank your butt ! PLEASE !!! \ " . Funniest thing ever . " 
Hubby just got home from work and the diaper run I sent him on . Not only does he bring back the diapers and wipes , he has also bought some UK pajamas for Kierian . On a brighter note , < PROPFEMALE > has been a bag of laughs today . Yesterday I told her that after Christmas she was getting her own room . So today when I get home from school , I ask her what does she want to do for the rest of the day . She says ' get my own room ' . 
Started Christmas shopping last night . 
My son was naked waiting for mommy to put his diaper on . His naked little self climbs off the couch and he stands up , holding up his foam sword , and proceeds to pee all over the floor . 
Watching < PROPFIRST > Mouse clubhouse with Maddy and Kieri . Went shopping last night with mama-in-law . Cannot wait until next weekend---Maddy's shopping will be finished . Mama-in-law tried to tell me that I am spending way too much money on a three year old . I asked her if she had seen the prices of everything lately . Things cost wayyyyyy too much ! 
Some stupid ass idiot woman ran her damn car up the freaking yard , broke a chunk off the damn stairs , slammed into < PROPFIRST>'s car which now probably has to be jumped and pushed his car into the neighbor's . Then the moron tried to run . Happy Sunday . 
My husband is simply the best . 
Wednesday is my favorite day of the week :) . And so is this this Saturday when I will be shopping until I drop . Maddy's shopping will be finished ! 
Happy late birthday Autumn , JoeJoe , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > ! Happy late anniversary Memaw and Pepaw , Uncle < PROPMALE > and Aunt Doty ! 
Five stores later and I have finally finished < PROPFEMALE>'s Christmas shopping . 
Is so very thankful for her beautiful family . Happy Thanksgiving everyone !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > and Kierian are going to have one hell of a Christmas . Just getting home from work . Sleepy time then it's off to take < PROPFEMALE > to see Tangled . 
Tangled was a cute movie . < PROPFEMALE > couldn't think of a word to describe it so she settled on \great\ " and \ " awesome\ " . Tomorrow < PROPFEMALE > is coming !!! " 
Just got home from seeing < PROPMALE > Potter with < PROPFEMALE > . Cannot wait for the last one . 
It's snowing :) 
Okay , seriously , stuff needs to stop going on sale that < PROPFEMALE > would love for Christmas . 
A little life has ended . In the short seven months that she was here , she was so well loved by her family and friends , but her sweet soul was needed more in heaven than here on earth . Rest in peace Nevaeh and watch over your big brother and your momma . A day will not go by when you are not thought about . I am so sorry for your loss , < PROPFEMALE > . We love you . 
Going to get our new puppy ! 
< PROPFIRST > let us have two puppies :) . One is my Christmas present . 
Day off tomorrow . Spending it my babies , my puppies , and my laundry . Life <3 
Some people just disgust me . 
Car wouldn't start this morning for me to go to work . Maddy's surgery was cancelled which I am glad for because I was worried about her and < PROPFIRST > driving . Catching up on laundry 
Kierian dove into the bathtub with Papaw tonight . Clothes and all . 
Just spent the last ten minutes pushing < PROPFEMALE>'s car out of Memaw's driveway . The girl got it stuck , we got it unstuck , and then the silly thing gets it stuck again ! Thank goodness for the kindness of others : a couple walked down the street and with their help , we got it unstuck again . Lol , I love you < PROPFEMALE > Murphy . Give us a baby girl ! 
A year ago today my great grandfather passed away and I am just so thankful that my son was able to meet his heroic great-great grandfather . If only he had been old enough to hear some of his Pappy's war stories . Also thinking about a sweet girl who left this Earth four months ago . Happy nineteenth birthday < PROPFEMALE > . And to all our loved ones we've given up -- continue watching over us . You are forever in our hearts . 
I can count to ten in seven languages , speak French , Chinese , and Spanish , I can cook anything you throw at me , I can tell you just about every historical romance author worth reading and give you a synopsis of their books , I can raise kids , master directions to any destination , clean , turn anything beautiful , and push cars out of snow and ice . But I cannot , for the life of me , wrap presents . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! Best Christmas news I have received -- I get to stay after season ! 
Christmas was pretty wonderful . Today is being spent with my beautiful family and figuring out where in the hell to put everything Maddy and Kieri got yesterday . And daddy has several things to put together ! 
Working tonight and tomorrow I will be taking myself to my favorite Borders and spending half my day there . <3 
I have a ridiculous headache and it is not going to go away anytime soon . Super excited about new books tomorrow ! 
I've got my babies and my books . Life is good . ? 
< PROPFIRST > is so sweet to me <3 . 
Is sitting at home with my crazy family , eating spaghetti and watching Maddy bowl on the wii and Kieri play with the radio control car . 
Today is being spent with my babies and hubby . 
Stocked up on medicine for the kids now , and Maddy officially has her own room now . It's a couple months early , but desperately needed especially since we are opening and putting together the rest of her's and Kieri's christmas presents . I still do not think that I went overboard . :] 
Just made bacon , sausage , eggs , and biscuits and gravy . Finishing Maddy's new room and later , we are heading over to the in-laws for dinner . :) 
Is playing Ni-Hao Kai-Lan Memory with Maddy , and all ready ready for the semester to be over with . 
? Happy wife , Happy life . ? 
Poor Kierian . He is not feeling very well :( . 
I love snow . 
Serenading < PROPFIRST > . He's not appreciating it very much :) . 
Hahahahahahha . Autumn's ipod is disabled for 21,391,410 minutes . Seriously , no joke . 
< PROPFEMALE > and Kierian were just given their dessert of half of a < PROPFEMALE > Q . Kieri sat down to eat his and the dumb dog Stormie came up and stole it from him . He stood up and started walking around crying so sadly . He got a new one and is now safely ensconced in the high chair , away from the \meaner\ " as < PROPFEMALE > said . " 
< PROPFEMALE > is just too funny . Kierian pulled out all of the dvds and Maddy started picking them up . She laid her gator golf club down and Kieri walked over and started stepping all over it . Maddy looked over and Kieri and then me and said , \Ugh ! Get your son . \"" 
Babies are fast asleep . Just waiting on my hubby to get home . ? 
Dear asshole , screw you very much for running over my dog and then leaving her in the middle of the street . < PROPFIRST > and I discovered her around 1:15 am and she died two hours later . Rest in peace , Roxxie . You were the sweetest dog ever . 
Every two minutes , Autumn is bringing me her phone and having me translate what some kid is telling her in Spanish . And then telling him that she can understand Spanish . Loser . 
Maddy thought she was going to get away with eating cookies for breakfast . Silly girl . 
< PROPFIRST > , Maddy , and Kieri came and visited me at work tonight . <3 
\Madison 
Laundry day . 
Dropping the babies off at Grammy and < PROPFEMALE>'s house and heading up to Indianapolis with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , Jd < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > McGannon . 
\I can have this now\ " ( Maddy holding up her heart sucker . )\ 
Ugh . Stupid weather . Stupid allergies . I've had like eight nosebleeds today . Funny moment of the day : Kierian chasing Maddy around and every time she stopped , he'd push her . 
Dear Domino's employee , do not ask me my phone number , then tell me that I am giving you the wrong number when I try to , and then proceed to tell me the number of the phone I am calling on . 
Life is good . 
Kierian goes crazy over Warehouse Mouse . Funniest thing ever . 
Well , every night Stormie gets to eat Maddy's and Kieri's leftovers . Tonight , the little ungrateful jerk ate what they had left , but turned his nose up at the peaches . We'll see when he gets leftovers again . 
Kierian puked in my shoe . 
I told Maddy that we had to go and run some errands , and now she keeps telling me that we have to go get my \earrings \"." 
It was one year ago today when my great-grandmother left us to be with her sweetheart . Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day , Granny . Hope you are up there dancing and celebrating with Pappy . 
Today is a very sad day . Borders filed for Bankruptcy this morning and two stores in Louisville will be closed by April : The 4th street location and the Hurstbourne location . Thank Goodness my favorite will still be open out in St. Matthews and the Bardstown Road location too . :( 
Babies fast asleep , just waiting on < PROPFIRST > to get home ? 
< PROPFEMALE > glad to be home . 
\It doesn't take discounts off until the end . \ " Let me tell you how many times I say that in a day at work . Just got home after making a detour to see < PROPFEMALE > Miller and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE >." 
Could seriously care less about Nascar . And TNA for that matter . 
< PROPFIRST > attempted to braid my hair and it was an epic fail . At least he tried ?. 
Just saw the dumbest Mentos commercial . 
Made bacon-wrapped green bean bundles to go with dinner and now we are baking chocolate chip cookies . The cookie cutters went MIA and are no where to be found :( . 
There is no word , phrase , or sentence that can adequately describe what it feels like to be a mother . 
Banana and quite , quite happy . Just finished laughing with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > about the time we tattooed each others names to our butts . He's such a wonderful husband . 
Is considering today my six-month anniversary of being married . Your significant other will tell you you are beautiful and without flaws , but your soul mate will pop pimples for you , scratch your head when you run out of Head & Shoulders , pop your toes , tell you your breath stinks , lock you out of the car , and love you unconditionally . I love you < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
Snooki and Vinny just need to get married . 
Daddy got his tv , Mommy got her iPhone . Let me know if you want my number =) . Ready for the weekend : Maddy's wee-ball tomorrow that hopefully will not be canceled , then dinner tomorrow night with virtually the ENTIRE family . 
Was dumb when she thought she could walk into JCPenny's and get one outfit for Maddy and two for Kieri . Gotta come back tomorrow with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > because I cannot make up my mind . 
Had a really great time with my family tonight and we were missing only a couple of people . It's really hard to get the whole family together now . Excited for tomorrow : possible tattoo if I can squeeze it in , some shopping , and then dinner with the in-laws tomorrow evening . =) . Life is super great . 
Got the outfits today . These kids are going to be too cute to stand it . Plus , my bathroom stuff went on sale . =) 
< PROPFIRST > is just plain goofy . So Maddy and Kieri would not go to sleep tonight . While Maddyis now asleep , Kieri isn't . < PROPFIRST > and I put him into bed with us to try to get him to sleep , thinking that maybe he's just not feeling good(he has a cold ) . Every couple of minutes < PROPFIRST > tells him to go to sleep because he wants to play . Then he starts biting and tickling him . Most definitely not encouraging the boy to go to sleep . 
Dear jerk , thank you so very much for honking your stupid horn at me while I am trying to start my dead car . Had I not almost rear-ended you ( accidentally ) , I would have gotten out and given you an ear full because I was and am most definitely not in the mood . 
If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world . . who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you . . who works hard & would do anything for you . . who makes you laugh & drives you crazy . . who is your best friend , who takes care of you , who you want to grow old with , who you are thankful for everyday & you could not live without , then brag about him a little & re-post this with me ! 
Just figured out how to type Chinese on my iPhone ! And the coolest part , I can actually draw out the characters . 
Rain , rain , go away . 
It is such a small , small world . In five minutes , I've made two connections . 
Apples are more efficient than caffeine in keeping people awake in the mornings . 
Made our banana smoothies ( with a hint of orange ) tonight . Babies are in bed and now waiting for < PROPFIRST > to get home . In the meantime , should I watch You Again or Like As We Know It ? 
< PROPFIRST > got home just in time to watch Life As We Know It with me . Great movie . 
Loves her family . 
Spending the evening at home with my great family . Attempted to get our pictures done today . You know the kids that scream and cry and make you stare at them and their parents for allowing their kids to misbehave ? Yeah , those were me and my kids this morning . If I was capable at staring at myself , I would have . Not to worry , they are super cute , and we are making another attempt at a later date . 
Every room I walk in to there is either a < PROPFEMALE > , Tinkerbell , Rapunzel , or < PROPFEMALE > brush in it . As well as a truck . 
Kieri is helping Mommy cook dinner ( we are having breakfast , yum ! ) while Maddy takes turn on the WII with her aunts . 
My family makes my world go ' round ?. 
Maddy says \ I don't like horses I like pumas . \"" 
Kierian won't sleep so we are jamming on the xylophone . 
Happy Spring everyone ! And don't forget to check out the < PROPFEMALE > tonight . It's the closest it's been to the Earth in the past eighteen years . Very pretty . 
After a busy day of cleaning rooms , playing Disney < PROPFEMALE>'s Enchanted Journey on the Wii , and going to Toys R Us , I am now relaxing and watching Raw with my best friend , my husband :) . 
Is so excited about our new windshield wipers . It's the simple things in life ?. 
Just smelled Kierian and I'm thinking : How could something so cute produce something so foul ? 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Henderson , I now have the one of the coolest apps for my phone : Dragon Dictation . It's almost as good as the real thing . Almost . My birthday is in two weeks everyone and I only want three things : 1 ) to spend it with my family , 2 ) one ticket to Celtic Woman , and 3 ) Dragon Naturally Speaking . 
The best ice cream in the world : mint chocolate chip . 
For some reason I allowed Autumn < PROPFEMALE > Murphy to go with me to Indi's to pick up dinner . While we were there , she seriously tried to argue and tell me that in < PROPFEMALE > , they use pesos . No joke . 
My cousin < PROPFEMALE > Cannon is here =) 
Everyone can shut up about Kentucky . The only team that matters is my Knights . Got a date with my tv tomorrow at one . Let's go Bellarmine ! 
Let's go Bellarmine ! Bring home the championship ! 
BELLARMINE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > m 
< PROPFIRST > thinks he is too cute with his comments tonight such as \I have accrued time away from you . \ " . That's okay because when he tries to get on his phone and xbox he won't be able to with the new passcode and parental locks =) . " 
Has had a great day . =) 
Ready for summer . 
Most exciting part of my day so far ? Milk at Aldi's for $1.49 . =) 
My throat is killing me =( . 
Throat still hurts and been sneezy all day . Waiting on < PROPFIRST > to get home so he can take care of me and watch Teen Mom 2 . 
Has two more car insurance payments to make and then we can switch companies . So looking forward to it . 
Laying in bed , eating popcorn , and watching Tangled with my favorite girl <3 . 
So < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Murphy finally passed something ! She's a CNA . Congratulations sister . 
My dad says this is the only time you will ever see him cheer on uconn . 
C-A-T-S CATS CATS CATS !!! 
For three weeks now Maddy has been driving me crazy about setting up her tee-ball stand and the weather has been horrible . Finally a nice day so guess what I am doing ?
