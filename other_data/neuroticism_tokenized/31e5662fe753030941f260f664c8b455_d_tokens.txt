wrote a multi-act romantic tragedy tonight . Story of my life . Laptop battery dies and I can't work on my book , so I work writing into game-making . 
I get online with a purpose . Then I troll though my home tabs . Then I get offline before doing what I got online to do in the first place . * sigh * 
I wanna see how creative my facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the third letter of your first name ... it can only be one word .. then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Dont just post a word and not copy ! 
Pie fries , Blackberry Merlot , murder and mayhem . That's what I have to look forward to tonight . It's gonna be a good one ! 
Had a very lovely evening with a very lovely Panda . <3 
Has had a really hard day ... 
Has her first day of class tomorrow !! Is it sad that after 15 years in academia , I'm still excited for the first day of school ? Lol . 
It's gonna be a good semester . Busy , but good . :) 
I'm seriously considering becoming a vegetarian ... or at the very least severely decreasing the amount of meat I eat ... 
feels so good to write again ... even if it is for a class . 
the temperature on the news is -0 degrees . -0 ? Really WSBT ? 
Is ecstatic that her car is getting fixed tomorrow !! 
soooo ... no class tomorrow . <3 Yess . 
Have you ever noticed the only thing people ever talk about in an elevator is weather ?

my Daddy loves me . He squirted Hershey's Syrup in the last bit of milk at the bottom of the gallon & gave it to me . <3 Today's been so awesome . 
Best description of cupid ever ? \A fat flying infant armed with a crossbow . \ " Rajiv from Outsourced . " 
So , Valintine's day is tomorrow . Who wants to be my Valintine ? 
It's a beautiful night ... we're lookin ' for something dumb to do ... hey baby , I think I wanna marry you . <3 To all my Valentines , especially < PROPFEMALE > Gray , < PROPFEMALE > Melin , & < PROPFIRST > Martellaro ! <3 <3 
has a serious case of the Mondays , even though it's Tuesday . 
is it just me , or has it felt like a really long week ? 
feels so good when the words flow like a steady stream . 
\Don't worry ; be happy . \ " Thanks Pandora . <3 " 
I finished my 2-hour Physics exam in 30 minutes & I'm feeling good about it . One of two things has happened . Either I pwned big time , or I was pwned big time ... 
That 2 hour Physics exam I finished in 30 minutes ? 98% . Oh yeah . 
fell down some stairs and twisted her ankle . I'm officially an idiot .
