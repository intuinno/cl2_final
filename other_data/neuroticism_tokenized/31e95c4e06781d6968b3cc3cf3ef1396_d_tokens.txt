The giant blue penis hanging from the commons ceiling came down today . How sad . 
Hülegü Khan : his presence in the Isma'ili history books has very much the feel of impending , inexorable doom . It's a little frightening even now . 
VINDICATION !

I don't think I've seen any movie more horrifying and revolting than Alien Resurrection . That's going to give me nightmare fodder for years . 
No remorse , no repent , we don't care what it meant . 
Das Wasser soll dein Spiegel sein/ Erst wenn es glatt ist , wirst du sehen/ Wieviel Märchen dir noch bleibt/ Und um Erlösung wirst du flehen 
So apparently I have a navel ring . 
Is it just me , or is every character in Predator 2 a complete asshat ? And that every single one has the planning and combat skills of a 3rd grader ? Also , Rule #4 ! Why does nobody ever remember Rule #4 ?

Ok , my iTunes is creeping me out . I just got 3 songs by The Sword in a row . I have 12 songs by that band , out of 1244 in my iTunes . It was set on shuffle .
