People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and ...... this is in honor of all the kids who need a helping hand . 
haha , i can now write a fork bomb(but i can't write a shell yet ) , a batch file , and a virus that will wipe your hard drive :p
