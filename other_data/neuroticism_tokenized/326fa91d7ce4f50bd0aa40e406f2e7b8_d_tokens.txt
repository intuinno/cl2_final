Hey everyone , I'm back ! >_> I'm tired and sick ....

Bought a tent , freakin CAMPING IN IT 
Slept out under the stars last night in my tent , falling asleep after watching for falling stars and aliens . We were in the middle of nowhere , no lights to disturb us and only the horses out there with us . It was beautiful and comforting . 
Without pain , without sacrifice , we would have nothing . 
' Sort of ' is such a harmless thing to say . Sort of . It's just a filler . Sort of - it doesn't really mean anything . But after certain things , sort of means everything . Like after ' I love you ' or ' You're going to live ' or ' It's a boy . ' - Demitri < PROPFIRST > 
I'm at the beach . The < PROPFEMALE > was huge and orange on the horizon . The lights are all off outside because the baby turtles are hatching right now . The water is the perfect temperature . Can't wait to get out and swim . ^^ 
The beach is awesome right now . ^ ^ And my hair color didn't melt . 
The < PROPFEMALE > is huge and orange . And < PROPFEMALE > is very bright . ^ ^ 
Back from the beach . ^ ^ 
Meteor shower tonight ... 12 to 5 a.m. Watch it . :D

I had a great weekend already . I love everyone who made this my best birthday ever . 
I'm sorry , but the violin , piano , and cello are just the most beautiful instruments . Nothing inspires me to write like good instrumental music . < PROPFIRST > Nevue <3 
We just did a coin toss on whether the characters in our story live or die , and the result is rather depressing . 
I'll be 18 in an hour ! I didn't even realize until dad came in my room and said he could kick me out soon . >_< 
< PROPMALE > Calderon , Kat Caraballo , and < PROPFIRST > V < PROPFIRST > were the first to tell me Happy Birthday at midnight . They all did at the same time , one by phonecall , one text , and one AIM . AWESOME . <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

Oh thunderstorms , how I've missed you . 
Soooo stressed , my chest hurts . >_< Does anyone else get themselves wayyy too stressed out about things for pretty much no reason ? Chill < PROPFEMALE > , chill . I need some Sublime or Incubus or something . 
Nolite te bastardes carborundorum . Don't let the bastards grind you down . 
Don't you just love how you can go from being crazy happy to hating everyone within a split second of your life ? 
Shit day . But I watched Supernatural at < PROPFEMALE>'s and viciously ate the last of her chocolate < PROPFEMALE > . 
Coconut M&ms would make me the happiest little girl right now . 
I want to be a real RockNRolla . 
Lmfao . I made a bracelet which has annoying Easter-egg pastel colors . So of course < PROPFEMALE > has to make one ten times as obnoxious , with colors you might see on a bad 80's jumpsuit . You gotta love that quirky bastard . 
Please put this on your status if you know \ 
someone ( or are related to someone ) who was killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My\

least one hour ? 
I'm pretty sure everyone's day started out great and ended .... well , like shit . There must be something in the air . I'm definately going to bed early . 
< PROPFEMALE > is right . Read her rant . People disgust me sometimes . Yeah , let's protest the yearbook . The fucking stupid yearbook that someone worked really hard on . But when I protest things for animal rights or someone comes to talk about human injustices no one cares , or they laugh at us . 
Holy shit . End rant . I'm getting frustrated at people again . I'm going to bed like I meant to do a long time ago . Goodnight everyone , sweet dreams . 
OH MY LORD . BIGGEST BUG EVER ON MY ROOF RIGHT NEXT TO A SPIDER . SCOOT OVER < PROPFEMALE > , IM SLEEPING WITH YOU .

Pull over and jump out and scream some more while Kat and < PROPFEMALE > try to find the roach . Dont find it . Get back in car . ROACHHH COMING AT MY FACE . Pull over again . Never find roach ... 
Ah , I love the beach .

I cant remember ever being this happy and at peace in my life . After that amazing week at the beach I come to my new home and its so perfect . I've already started planting herbs , weeding my butterfly garden that I'm going to start , and there is a piece of land for my fruit and vegetable garden . I have a huge yard and everything is so peaceful . Oh , and you can actually see the stars at night . I love it here . 
:( I miss my dog . 
LMFAO I love you < PROPFEMALE > Wunder . When asked \Why are you so damn sexy ? \ " she naturally replies \ " well you see .... it all happened when I met < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > 
Me , < PROPFIRST > , and Torch had Taco < PROPFEMALE > for breakfast . Oh yes , the greatest way to start your day .... 
Dear Jesus ... I know we don't talk often but ... please save me before < PROPFIRST > growns eight arms and punches me in the face with each of them .

And you pull me in . 
The end is extremely fucking nigh . 
At a family party with Kat . I think im gonna turn spanish by the end of the day . 
THE END IS EXTREMELY FUCKING NIGH .

< PROPFEMALE > ' < PROPMALE>' Chay and I rescued a puppy today . She looks like a little hyena she's so messed up . She's all skin and bones and hairlessness . Poor baby . Torch and I will make her better :) 
:D Puppy's asleep in my lap . Poor little bastard is going to take a lot of fixing up lol . 
I think the internet hates me right now , and that's not something I'm happy about . Also , my face is a horse . That is all . 
My face is no longer a horse . That is all . 
Uhg , I hate being bored in the wee hours of the morning . Oh , but its 311 and that , at least , makes me smile a < PROPMALE > . 
Day Two of Operation Rescue Mini Mange has been very fruitful . The puppy has been wagging her tail a lot , something she didn't really do yesterday . She barked at < PROPFEMALE > and I for walking away from her , and best of all , she finally played with us . ^^ She just got her oatmeal bath and is once again asleep in my lap . 
Do you ever write out a whole status , realize no one cares , then never say a damn word ? 
Bored . I suppose sleep in an option . 
Uploading a bunch of old pictures . I miss < PROPFIRST > and his adrenaline rush stupidity .. >_< 
SO bored , I'm looking at college classes . 
Ah intelligence , how I love you . A shame that its a quality that's hard to find .

Awake and itchy . Things bit me all night , I didn't fall asleep until 9 this morning . -__- 
I'm a < PROPMALE > allergic to bug bites . Ants mauled my wrist of all places . It is swollen . I ' m shaking . Isn't making a garden just a JOYFUL AND ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE ? 
Can't sleep . So I'm going to try and draw a tree on my wall . Should be fun . 
We must all fear evil men . But there is another kind of evil which we \

>_< No matter how many RVB quizes I take , I'm always Caboos or Tucker . I feel so bad for everyone who spends any amount of time with me . 
Sometimes , I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear And I can't help but ask myself how much I let the fear Take the wheel and steer . It's driven me before And it seems to have a vague , haunting mass appeal But lately I'm beginning to find that I Should be the one behind the wheel . 
I think .... I'll try to write my book now ... * takes in deep breath * Wish me luck . >_> 
So about that book .... Its uh , its a < PROPMALE > difficult to write . -_-' I've got the first sentence . 
Thank god Torch is awake now . Its scary the thing's you'll do when you can't sleep . I did laundy , dammit . LAUNDRY . 
I think I will call him \crunchbite\ " ... \ 
I'm gonna go apply for college tomorrow . I'm hoping to get into a botany and zoology class , and maybe creative writing . I'm still debating on the last class . >_> I could definitely work on my writing .... 
I'm so glad I have friends who don't sleep either . Skype with Torch and < PROPFEMALE > Schamber . Guys , its ok to be a redneck . 
Dear Facebook , I managed to fall off the bed during skype with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . That is all . 
I'm filled with the bored disease . I fear it may be terminal ... 
Dragon Age needs to hurry up and get here so I have something to do while everyone else is off sleeping or being productive with their lives . 
Playing Dragon Age all night . Hells yeah . 
Must ... beat ...... Dragon Age ..... * eyes bleed * 
DAMMIT I DID NOT PLAY THROUGH DAYS OF THIS GAME JUST TO HAVE YOU SACRIFICE YOURSELF TO SAVE ME . SCREW THIS GAME . 
:) I feel complete . Dragon Age , you are done , and I finally got the ending I wanted . \ 
Round two ? I think yes . 
Well , now that I've beaten my game , I suppose I can return to daylight and society ... 
The puppy is looking great . She's finally playing and biting Torch and I to death . :) She's going to be ok and we're keeping her . Still no name ... >_> 
Anyone up ? Torch is going to bed and I'm not tired . :/ 
* Waves picket signs * SAVE < PROPMALE > !

Life is one big question when you're staring at the clock 
Facebook makes me realize just how disgustingly touchy-feely some people are . I see sides of people I never wanted to know by the groups they join .... >_>

Ramen and grape soda . 
A bluebird leaves a feather in the same place at least once a week when I go outside . I pick it up and thank the bird and leave . Well , I was thinking it was about time I found another , so I went out and there it was . But it was broken so I left it there . I came back out three hours later and there was a new feather in its place all perfect and blue and white . Now I feel bad because I think I rejected a gift >_< ! 
You always know the shit is about to go down when the game autosaves as you walk through a door . 
Day two of no sleep . * walks around like a grumpy zombie *

Its about time we met and made a mess . \ 
Someone go diving with sharks with me ? No cages . 
Someone point me in the right direction of a good game for < PROPFEMALE > and I to play . She's almost done with Dragon Age and we need MOREEE . Bioshock two is an option . 
Painting my room seafoam , because .... well because I'm me . And listening to my < PROPMALE > Mansel/ Apocalyptica channel on Pandora . I'm nearly done drawing my tree so I can paint that next . 
>_< Attack of the caterpillars !!! 
Today a monkey followed me whenever he saw me and called to me , a bunch \ 
of birds at the aviary landed on me , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > , the one on my \ 
shoulder licking my face , then two leopards woke up to try and play with\ 
< PROPFEMALE > and I because we had a giant stuffed chameleon that they wanted . Oh , and we pet stingrays and fed a giraffe :D !!! We'll be posting pics of our mini vacation . 
:) I get to go see < PROPFIRST > at the end of the month . The past few days have been good . 
I'm .... so afraid .... for my life ..... Living with < PROPFEMALE > keeps you on your toes . She might kill me at any moment . Then laugh about it . 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > and the Frog for the 800th time with < PROPFEMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > Ferguson hosting Shark Week is like some wondrous dream coming true .... 
Watching the mother fucking Powerpuff Girls with Torch . 
Boomerang is just so amazing .... Yes < PROPFIRST > , Teen Titans is on . And then , the holy Samurai < PROPFIRST > .

I can't recall why people drive cars . My scooter is the bomb . I'm sooo glad it has two seats . * high fives < PROPFIRST > Peters for not killing me or herself * 
I told myself I was really for real going to start working on my book . Then I started watching the live steam of Questionable Content getting drawn ... Stupid < PROPFEMALE > . Stupid stupid stupid ! ... Then somehow I got back into my \You'll never write a book\ " mentality . * facepalm * " 
Chillin with the door to my balcony open . There is an owl outside and I think its singing . ^^ 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Chay and driving around the yard for an hour on the scooter with her and talking about our lives . Who knew going in a circle could be so hilarious ?

I am eating dinner with < PROPFIRST > . You are not . Ha ha , Ha ha ha . 
Interview at Lowes tomorrow morning . * crosses fingers * 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish\ 
is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a \ 
choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking \ 
for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . Most people won't want to copy and \ 
paste this .... But do you have the strength to make it your status for \ 
at least one hour ? Promote Love & Acceptance , NOT hate ? 
Our new dog is the most beautiful thing ever .... I'm so damn happy . I can't wrap my mind around how someone doesn't want him ... But at least we have him now . I <3 you Balto . 
There are more dogs in my house than people now .

Lol I can't wait until the Westboro church people die so the whole country can party at their funerals . 
RU-FI-OHHHHHHHHHH 
Take THAT archdemon . 
Three days . THREE . DAYS . 
Rango = Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas references , a thousand adult jokes , a bit creepy , not a kids movie , and pretty good . 
After about a month of being here , I feel like I live in Washington . 
Arg , guys . Gas strikes don't work . It doesnt hurt the company because you just buy your gas the next day or the day before . You arent using any less gas . That would be like going on a hamburger strike on Monday so you eat your fill of hamburgers Sunday . This happened before and there were huge lines to buy gas the next day and the companies were fine . If you're really trying to make a stand , use less gas ALWAYS . 
I get back from a month in Washington and the first thing my grandma says to me is to get a job , clean my room , and do some yardwork . >_>' * slinks away * 
Yesterday my phone charger broke and my phone is dead . Today my motherfucking computer charger broke and I have like ten minutes on here to save all of my stuff onto a usb ..... so .... RAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
After watching I Am Number Four and then an episode of Glee , I realize I have a new lady crush .
