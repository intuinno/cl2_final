Dear Charity\ 
It has been 3 and a half months since we went our separate ways and I have felt every day that has past . I have felt more pain than I have every felt before . Today I heard the first song I ever sang to you come on the radio and something strange came over me . I didn't turn the station . I didn't shed a tear . I think that I have finally gotten over everything . I hope everything is working out good for you . 
got a haircut ( finally ) and goin to church ... peaceful evening ... 
Hope was telling daddy that she wanted to paint his toenails ... He refused and she was mad ... Who's got two thumbs and just got < PROPFEMALE > apple red toenails ... This guy ... Thank goodness for nail polish remover ... Oh well , whatever makes Hope happy ...

I don't understand how people can say there is no God ... If they want to see how real he is then they need to witness the beauty of the Earth from 30,000 feet ...
