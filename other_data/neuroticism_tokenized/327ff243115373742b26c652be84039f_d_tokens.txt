Ok , this is messed up . I stayed up until 8am because I was gonna pull an all nighter so I could sleep at 1am , right ? Well , I accidentally fell asleep . Woke up at 5pm . ... Missed the entire day . Damn . 

Is eating ramen . It ti's delicious . 
Going to Camp Monday ~~~ 
IS BACK FROM CAAMP . :33333 
In Los Angelos . 86 Degrees . Jeaous , my friends in Alaska ? :D And yes . I'm totally rubbing it in your faces . 
Westboro Baptist Church . Possibly the worst Church I have ever heard of , and a reason so many people choose not to associate with Religion . 
I call a vote ! For Halloween , should I be : the ' Geek in the Pink ( Complete with < PROPFIRST > Mraz Album and I might actually sing the song )' , or should I be a Ninja ( Which I have the weapons to do so) ? 
Today I was on MSN and one of my friends called me a ' Long-necked Dinosaur ' . I'm more excited about this than I should be . < PROPFEMALE > . 
I feel horrible . 98.1 has corrupted me , because I'm listening to Tik Tok by < PROPFEMALE > . Dx That and the Black Eyed Peas . 
Today at work , an elderly man comes up to me and asks where the eggs were . Not being in a good mood , I smiled sarcastically and said they were on Aisle 4 . A few minutes later , I see him exiting the store with a carton of eggs . I work at Home Depot . MLIA . 
At Chemistry . Listening to music . Blowing up balloons filled with coffee creamer , rubbing alchohol , and gun powder . :D 
Is feeling sick . And has two math lessons to do . And a paper . Dx Help ? 
Just saw ' The men that Stare at goats ' . Humorous , but weird . Verry weird . 
I'm at the Alaska Club ~ ~ Staying til 6am . 
Ahh Crap . There's a party thing today ; I need to get a gift for the exchange . Dx I need to stop procrastinating . 
DANGER DANGER . HIGH VOLTAGE . 
is happy . :3 He's gotten four early Christmas Pressies . ;33333 INCLUDING AND EXTENSION ON HIS JAPANESE . :DDDD 
Is it sad that it took me seeing < PROPMALE>'s status about getting his Orange in Kung-Fu to remember that I got my black belt ? ._______. 
< PROPFEMALE > Squagers Port , why is this happening ? I send you a happy birthday and Dynamite comes on . I go to Florida and see a map of Mexico in a Mexican restaurant . \Dynamite\ " is made by Taio < PROPFIRST > . The name of a city that caught my eye ? \"< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST >.\" < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are pronounced the same . WHAT THE HECK . " 
This little girl was alone in the world , Until she found a way to get a fix for free ! Oh pretty please , It breaks my heart to see another tragedy . She finally got her picture on TV . 
Z ?????????? a ??????? l ?????????????? g ????????? o ?????????????? ???????? c ???????????? o ????????????? m ???????????? e ????????? s ???????????????!??????????? 
Is it bad that I bought Ke$ha's new album for the lol's and I actually like it ? D: 
Fuf , E's cu punat E's kuehk du maynh y myhkiyka vnus y jetau kysa . e.e 
Wow , I don't have to go to class . It's to cold out to walk . xD Forty Below ! Woo ! 
Heck yes ! Got a webcam ~ Skyype here I come . 
Just got Skype ! Add < PROPFEMALE > . nick . sullivan . Yes , there is a period at the end . :3 
I just realized ; What does < PROPMALE > Port do when I have the XBox ? I mean , there really isn't much to do at his house even when he does have it . :/ 
OK , I'm confused ; What is ' To Save a Life ? ' Everyone is talking about it and I don't know what it is . D: 
Blaaah . Going on a trip sometime soon . We aren't leaving until my sister's baby is born , so I really have no idea when we're gonna be going . Anyone who attempts to make plans with me will get very vague answers . 
In < PROPFIRST>'s Lake , Canada ! ;D Only eight more hours till Bellingham . God I miss the US . And internet . D: 
So much driving . I can't take it anymore ! D: I wanna go back hooome . I miss human interaction and the internet . 
OK , why is it that when I finally get internet the one person I want to talk to just happens to be asleep ? 
Going back on the road in 3 hours or so . DDDDDx I don't wanna leave the internet ... 
So I just got a message from my youth group that says they're going to a Super Bowl Party with food and such . ... Way to rub it in guys . D:< 
So welcome to Youtube . Yeah , I said welcome to YouTube . Hey . Welcome to YouTube . I said listen and linger . < PROPFIRST > the unicorn bit my finger . It's YouTube . The impact is evident . Ms. Teen South < PROPFEMALE > just ran for vice president . Upload a video . You got nothin ' to lose . Except all of your friends . And the approval of your parents . 
Well , all my friends in Alaska , I can safely say that I love California . 65 degrees in Monterey guys ! [/fist pump ] 
Got one of those Wireless things that let you get WiFi anywhere . :3 To bad it has a limited amount of Data . 
OK , is it sad that I am finding myself adoring the \This is My Life / Confessions Pt . 2\ " Mash Up by the Glee Cast ? D: " 
OK , I'm really confused . All of a sudden Robot Unicorn Attack is obscenely popular . Why ? I have no clue , other than it being the most epic game ever , but I'm suspecting that a lot more people know of the ' chans ' than I thought ... 
Ahh . A new Highscore on RUA . 86k , guys . I'm content at the moment . = 3 = 
Why is it that whenever I have internet , the internet gods say that no one I know will be online ? :/ 
Is it sad that the only reason I really come onto FaceBook is to epic-chat to < PROPMALE > Port , < PROPFIRST > Kimbleton , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and occasionally fan a few pages ? 
I'm plotting to take over the world with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ? We're not planning on teaming up with Canadia and going to attack Scotland before turning around and stabbing Canadia in the back when they're weak . We're also not planning on sparing all the Hogwarts staff nor are we planning on Shanking anyone who disagrees with us . Such wild imaginations you people have . 
Washington , Oregon , Cali , < PROPFEMALE > , Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , Missouri , annnnd Kansas . This is far to many places to have been in two months . 
OK -- I feel like a dork . D: I bought HeartGold today -- I've been overcome by nostalgia . THE MEMORIES ~ 
Heart Gold is annoying me . D: DAMMIT EEVEE . EVOLVE ALREADY . [/rage ] 
It only took me five hours of walking around in Heart Gold , but the Eevee FINALLY evolved . :D ESPEON , I LOVE YOOOU . 
So -- I beat most of HeartGold . Got bored of killing everything so I restarted and happened to choose , little did I know , the hardest beginning pokemon . ... FML . 
is about to get on the plane . At five am . Why ? Because the plane leaves at Six . ... I think the plane gods hate me . D: [/cries ] I'm so tiiiredd . 
I'm finally home ! DID YOU MISS ME FAIRBANKS ? :D 
Twenty five hours of video games . My life has never been more complete . :D 
Today I realized that ' Serverus ' means ' Grumpy ' in latin . I now understand Snape so much more than before . 
Yeah , and it's gonna be totally awesome ! 
SaGe : \Team < PROPMALE > ? Laaaame . \ " Luke : \ " At least it's better than Team Edward . \ " Me : \ " Pssh . Team Emmet wins them all . Or Team Rocket . \"" 
We can dance if we want to . We can leave your friends behind . ' Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance . Well they're no friends of mine . I say , we can go where we want to . A place where they will never find . And we can act like we come from out of this world . Leave the real one far behind . And we can dance . 
I got a Cellphone for my Birthday ! \ 
C :\ 
888-8052 -- gimme a call if you want me to have your number . 
Luke : Is Final Fantasy XIII the most popular out of Final Fantasy XIII ? \ 
Me : ... Nooo . Final Fantasy XIII isn't the most Popular Final Fantasy XIII [/sarcasm ] 
\So ... Your shirt is very purple . It matches my Gaia Toolbar . \ " \ " I see . ... Your shirt is very Green . I matches MY Gaia Toolbar . \ " \ " ... I think we just won at life . \""

7 Months in eight days . <3

I hate Valdez . So . Much . [/dies ]

I will be completely honest for the next 24 hours . You can ask me one question(ONLY IN MY INBOX . ) any question , no matter what or how CRAZY . I will answer no matter what . You have my full honesty but I DARE YOU TO PUT THIS AS YOUR STATUS and see what questiosn you get . 
So , I learned today that on GoogleChrome when I hit the \h\ " key into an empty address bar it tries to direct me to the < PROPMALE > Potter Wiki . ... I've never been more proud of myself . " 
Just got an iTouch and now my iTunes is deciding to not recognize it . DAMN YOU iTUNES . 
So ... maybe I should get to reading this \Crazy Love\ " book . I completely forgot about that . Hm ... Ah I'll do it later . " 
So , I think I might go to UMassD . It has a bunch of stuff that I would really like in a College . Not to mention that it supposedly has a decent Psyche program . 
So I downloaded the new Skype . ... Now it won't even launch . Never been more aggravated in my life . 
So , I'm just starting to realize that Lady Gaga songs sound so much better when < PROPFIRST > by men . Just saying . 
Went to class for the first time in awhile tonight . Saw < PROPFEMALE > Dunkle again ! ' s been awhile . ... Oh and DeSean < PROPFIRST > was there too , I guess . 
So , I swear I have the worst luck ever when it comes to this ASL thing . My camera now won't recognize my computer . ... FML . Any ideas on how to get some kind of response as to what to do with the Videos I need ? 
So ... my best friend is wearing Silly Bands . I have never been so disappointed . 
I'm thinkin ' baby , you and I are undeniable -- but I'm finding out love is unreliable . I'm giving all I got to make you stay , or am I just a roadblock in your way ? ' Cause you're a pretty little windstorm out on the Boulevard , something like a sun set , oh you're a shooting < PROPFEMALE > . <3 \ 
I love this song . Srsly . 
So , I turned my radio on and I'm now rocking out at almost full Volume . I love my speakers . <3 
Fly Like a G6 ? Definitely . 
So , I think that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is likely one of , if not the , best out of all the female pop artists out there . I feel ... very unmanly right now . But I seriously love her music . It's sad , I know , but so worth it . <3 
PSAT in the morning . Wish me luck ! <3 
My whippeed ice dair drink brings the attention of many males to my place of residence and/or employment , and they declare that its quality far surpasses that of yours . Absolutely , it far surprasses yours . I could convey to you the recipie , but I would have to demand compensation . \ 
Oh how I love this . 
Skype's deciding to not open . Again . [/rage ] 
Is about to try reinstalling Skype for the third time . I'm getting so sick and tired of this . 
So , I'm learning that I hate math . ' Specially since I don't remember a lick of it . Ugh . This + Seeing things in my window = So annoying . 
I swear I keep seeing this thing in my window . ' s really starting to freak me out . 
Has a Paper due in 18 hours that he has yet to start . ... When he was given a full month to do it . ... Wish me luck ? 
Good morning partially finished ASL paper . How are you this fine day ? ... That's good . Did you know that you make my life miserable by simply existing ? Yeah . Think about that awhile . 
On top of everything , now my webcam isn't working . FML . 
For everyone who said I couldn't do it , I finished that paper . <3 1,990 words on the < PROPFEMALE > . I feel accomplished . 
So ... today was eventful . Woke up at 7am and left for 12 hours to work of which I'm only getting paid for about half that because I didn't do anything almost the entire time . ... Also , I almost gouged myself with a power drill in a place that makes people wince at the thought of being kicked there . \ 
... \ 
Missed by an inch . And this power drill makes mulch out of wood . ... I hate drills .

Best way to keep your Significant Other Happy ? When they fall asleep in the middle of a Skype or MSN conversation , send them really sappy messages . I swear , it works . 
Oh , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . I constantly wonder how < PROPFIRST > Sparks beat you out in < PROPFEMALE > n Idol . < PROPFEMALE > , I hate you . Why would you boot out someone that isn't a cookie-cutter Female Pop Artist ?! [/rage ]

Ha . I win . 
So , why is it that when I actually want to talk to someone no one's ever online ? 
So I was playing Fable 3 today , and while I was scanning for survivors/a weapons shop , I noticed something in Bowerstone Old Town . A building called \Flotsam's Jetsam . \ " ... Am I the only one that assumed that they were referring to Flotsam and Jetsam from the Little Mermaid ? " 
So , I was bored and on YouTube and I found the Glee Cover of Teenage Dream . Turns out it was < PROPFIRST > by < PROPMALE > Criss . I looked the guy up and my brain exploded . < PROPMALE > Criss = < PROPMALE > Potter from AVPM . ... I need to watch more Glee . 
I throw my homework in the air sometimes , sayin ' Ayoooo , I'll take a Zeroooo . 
Just got back from a dance . It . Was . Amazing . And apparently I have basic \Popping\ " down . Basic . Still looks cool . "

I love my friends .

Dear Procrastinators , I got your back . \ 
Sincerely , the Internets . 
Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6 ) there shouldbe no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is for violence against children . 
Just opened his new copy of Call of Duty Black Ops . With a Katana . That's right . Who need scissors ? 
< PROPMALE > Port , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Dowler , and < PROPFEMALE > Squagers Port -- I just learned two songs in ASL in an hour . Can I feel proud ? 
wishes that some of his friends would actually get on MSN and/or Skype . 
I am quite proud of myself . This profile pic's rather epic , and I made it myself . <3 
Holy crap , I used to think these Vector things were hard . They're so not . <3 [/new profile pic already ] 
< PROPFIRST > Dowler and < PROPFIRST > Byrnes ; I just won a Domination match . 201 to 8 was the score , and my K/D was 21/5 . I feel beast . 
is probably not sleeping tonight . Joy ! 
is leaving for Florida in 3 hours . Wheee . 
In Florida . Also , I'm really tired . 
Is having trouble remembering that none of my friends are awake at 7am . STUPID TIME ZONES . 
Just found Shutter glasses that actually have lenses . I am amazed . 
Bought 150 dollar sunglasses for 15 dollars . [/insert beast here ] 
[/dies of hunger ] 
Updating my FB status from 30k feet . Maybe higher , I dunno . 
Is going through really bad Turbulence . I hope I don't die . 
I want to go home . Like , now . ... [/clicks heels ] Darn . YOU LIED TO ME , WIZARRRRD . 
Has been playing a lot of Fire Emblem since he doesn't have access to reliable internet . As in , I got so bored of playing the normal game that I went into my computer and found the ROM file of the game . And hacked it . To Death . 
Apparently is now a Taurus . I don't think I'm pleased with this . 
United State of Pop 2010 just came on the radio . I . Am . Amazed . 
Has Facebook , Mountain Dew Voltage , Music , Pizza , and soon ? Black Ops . Good day is ... very good . 
You know you're a little obsessed with Black Ops when you're planning on learning the Zombie's Theme song simply because it's on the Piano . 
Nothing more annoying than practicing an instrument and realizing after a week of said practice that you really haven't accomplished anything . 
10 hours of straight Black Ops . Mountain Dew Voltage , Brisk Iced Tea , internet , killing people , < PROPFIRST > Dowler and < PROPMALE > Port at my house , Chaz Amazicrazy Lyons over Live . I think it was a very good night . Wake up time ? 3:10 pm . BAM . 
[/starts setting up the Xbox on his TV since the garage is full of bad music and cold ] 
Just had a 12/0 K/D on Black Ops , only for my mom to come in and tell me to go help dad . Being on Live , I can't pause so I quit with great remorse . ... Only to find that Dad can do the entire thing by himself . [/siiiiigh ] 
Loves how when I put that I'm engaged , no one questions it . 
[/has an ooVoo ] You should give me yours . > > 
After a Hurricane , there's a rainbow ~ 
Just got done singing my S.O. to sleep . I feel a little accomplished , now . But this is when the < PROPMALE > dies of sleep deprivation . ... Or not . THERE'S BLACK OPS TO BE PLAYED . ... But first there's school to be done . FML . 
Doesn't like being sick . Maybe Black Ops will cheer me up since I can go < PROPFEMALE > out with everyone at the Super Bowl Party . 
So , when you're sick your body temp goes up . But when it goes up you get colder . What the heck . 
Take me hand , closer your eyes ... With you right here I'm a Rocketeer ~ 
2am . Not tired because of a five hour nap I took at 7pm . Have a bit of school to do . ... FINAL FANTASY 13 , I MISSED YOU . [/plays ] 
Problem with being awake at 3:37 am on a school day ; No one is awake to keep you company . 
Just did two assignments that we had a month to work on in four hours . I'm a beast . 
< PROPMALE > Port : I have so much schhooool . \ 
Me : Oh ? You wanna trade ? \ 
< PROPMALE > : ... No . \ 
Me : Didn't think so . No go do your school so you can come over . ... And do your chores so your parents can't say no for any reason . \ 
< PROPMALE > : ... Alright ... 
Me : ... Are you just going to leave that < PROPFEMALE > there on the ground ? \ 
< PROPMALE > Port : That was a < PROPFEMALE > ? \ 
Me : Yeah . \ 
< PROPMALE > : ... I thought it was a radish . 
Go to your profile . The first 5 friends on your sidebar are now your team in the zombie apocalypse . How well can you make it ? < PROPMALE > Port , < PROPFIRST > Dowler , < PROPFIRST > Cowling , Chaz Lyons , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Desrochers < PROPMALE > . I think we'd win . 
PSNetwork is being stupid , now . I just fixed the normal internet , and then this happens . I CAN'T WIN . [/dies ] 
Just got home from Walmart at 2:30 in the morn . Packing for Avalanche and going to play new game ' til I leave . Good Times . 
Is learning how magnets work . I liked it better when I didn't understand . ... Maybe the Mormons explain it better . 
Everytime I close my eyes , I see my name is shining lights ~ 
We are young , we run free , stay up late , we don't sleep , got our friends , got the night ... we'll be alright ~ 
Boredom is going to kill me soon . 
< PROPMALE > just called me a commie . I was proud of him until he apologized .
