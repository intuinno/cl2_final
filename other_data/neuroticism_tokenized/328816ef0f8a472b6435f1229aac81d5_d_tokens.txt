The writer of the quotes for the ghosts who supplier of the notes to the\ 
living 
And I'm brainless\ 
Which means I'm headless\ 
Like Ichabod Crane is\ 
Or foreplay-less sex is\ 
Which makes me stainless\ 
With no neck left to < PROPFEMALE > the chain with\ 
Which makes me necklace-less\ 
Like a necklace theft\ 
And I ain't used my headrest yet 
Watching the NBA draft for awhile then prolly talking to < PROPFEMALE > for a bit

'' As soon as you start to believe\

one time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul 
Wisdom teeth hurt quite a bit , taking some meds n laying down ..... 
Not feeling so good , taking a cold shower n then just laying back down and resting .... 
My wisdom tooth hurts < PROPFEMALE > bad that it woke me up and now Im trying to get back to bed with my whole head being in pain ... wellll goodnight world , hopefully 
I wish I could live in the grey area , but no matter how I look at things Im a black and white type of person ... 
I remember a time when standing for something , stood for something 
stressing out ... 
Its hard when you feel so lonley but know that you cant be in a relationship , and it seems that girls dont believe in being friends these days 
Or is it something they can never believe\ 
Or is it something you can never achieve\ 
Is it Beyond your mean\ 
Is it Inside your dreams ? \ 
Can it Never come out cause it's scared to\ 
Unprepared to\ 
Too worried \ 
You don't want them to hear you\ 
You just wish there was a door that would appear that you can go \ 
disappear through\ 
Well I'm feeling your pain\ 
I was feeling the same\ 
But I said I'd never feel that again 
Take a Step inside , what you see will burn your eyes 
Aint no rest for the wicked\ 
and there aint no Love for me .. 
and there aint no Love for me .. :-( 
sometimes you just wanna cry , but you just dont have any crying in you \ 
thats when the sadness turns to anger\ 
anger that must be thrown away 
Making myself go to bed because Im driving myself crazy 
Wathing Code Geas \ 
'' To change the world , YOU must walk the path of carnage , to save the world WE must walk the path of peace '' 
My bestfriend is my world oh How I love her sooooo much <3 \

beyond frustrated at my life .... 
Saturday = Basketball allll day .. D < PROPMALE > style ... those are always the best days\

Code Geas 
Wow People disgust me , guess at this point in life I shouldnt be surprised with peoples actions no matter who they are .....

Living up the rest of the summer to the fullest before I depart in September\

Me : and Licking oil and pissing petroleum 
whatever ... 
Not feeling to well , sick and stressed ...... get at me 
4 , 3 , 2 , 1\ 
thats the sound \ 
the end of the world is coming 
Friend , just another word for enemy except it takes you longer to realize it\ 
Friends are demons underneath your bed , hiding in the closet 
Honor and Loyalty are the most important qualities someone can have .... 
Everyone is just so full of disappointment , starting to question why I even bother \ 
then I realize its not worth letting it all get to you ..... 
Being sick is the worst ! 
what a sad thing to realize ....... 
Bummed 
Begin each day as if it were on purpose 
“Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek ; and you shall \ 
find ; knock and it shall be opened unto you . For every one that asketh \ 
receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it \ 
shall be opened . [ Matthew 7:7 -8 ] . ” 
Goodnight ! 
Playing Heroes for awhile

People think they are sooo smart and cool , well none of you are infact its quite easy to see through all the BS 
Refs ruin all sports entertainment ... time to put an end to this 
always 2nd best .... always the runner up ... n I fucking hate it 
disappointed .... 
Tired .. going to bed soon 
Some guys are just flat out losers , and its just a matter of time before the whole world finds out what they are really made of , Nothing at all ..... worthless 
Its all bound to happen ... 
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth if only it could be done 
close my eyes 
never had such a feeling 
'' ohhh it hurts me soul''- < PROPFIRST > 
You Are What I Need 
Might go < PROPFEMALE > out with the cousin for a bit ... \ 
'' one time missing sunshine will never hurt the soul '' 
'' one time missing sunshine will never hurt the soul''\ 
goodnight world ..... 
Or is it something they can never believe ? \ 
Or is it something you can never achieve ? \ 
Is it\ 
Beyond your means ? \ 
Inside your dreams ? \ 
Can it\ 
Never come out cause it's scared to\ 
Unprepared to \ 
You just wish there was a door that would appear that you can go disappear\ 
through\ 
All good things come to an end , most before beginning ..... 
Its never gonna be the same , n I dont know how your okay with that 
People have really gone crazy , and no I dont mean a good crazy ... fools 
No , None of this is okay , its not right , infact its all wrong , but unlike grade school we dont get to go sit back down at our desk for corrections , we are made to live with it knowing that its all wrong ... what kind of shit is that 
going to be one with nature 
A key that opens many locks is a master key . A lock that is opened by many keys is a shitty lock- in response to sluts lol 
Lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel\ 
And its well and its fine and its fine if it fell\ 
And you couldn't find the story line if you survive to retell\ 
We are targets , Hello darkness 
[ Verse 2]\ 
He just sits and waits for them to kick in the door\ 
He once was a hero they don't love him no more\ 
There's a blast , every time a foot hits the floor\ 
His gift for not fighting another man's war 
Four Loco's are my new bestfriend lol 
'' And if your plane fell out of the skies\ 
Who would you call with your last goodbye\ 
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives\ 
So when we long for absolution , \ 
There'll no one on the line '' 
Trying to make thiS Darien Lake thing happen 
'' come on yall now lets make cocaine cool\ 
we all need a few more half naked women up in our pool '' 
I fell on purpose to stay a freshmen\ 
I lose\ 
But < PROPFIRST > attended the school for X-Men\ 
So when I get my cap and gown and put the rappin ' down\ 
I'll only know half my powers , but I spent half an hour 
my femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel\ 
once caught her changing the batteries in her halo\ 
receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for\ 
and the address to the factory where they made those 
The lessons of life are constantly present in everything around us . This is one of the beautiful concepts within creation . 
Insomniac since way back , see that's what I been like\ 
Bacon , eggs and pancakes , eating that at midnight\ 
Getting up and going hard , I don't need no Enzyte\ 
Come across as very calm , mental state is Zen like\ 
Always had a lot of heart , never been the tin type\ 
Never will I drop a dime , never been the ten type 
Getting lost inside the mind of < PROPFIRST > Fiasco FnF 
always had a lot of heart , never been the tin type 
I get my energy from my inner G \ 
I be in outer space , but I got inner peace \ 
So tell my enemies that they can't injure me \ 
I know that irritates , you have my sympathies 
Through myself\ 
First of all accuse myself\ 
For being a fool\ 
All attempts to school myself have failed\ 
To improve means to remove myself\ 
From this pool of sharks , dark as the mood I felt\ 
I’m losing fuel\ 
That’s all the food I refuse myself\ 
That’s how you do when you do yourself\ 
And if I lose , I could never excuse myself\ 
Till I grow old , sit back , and accrued my wealth 
You protect it you < PROPFEMALE > and caress it\ 
Your precious little ethicless method\ 
Been tryna take me off of my perspective\ 
But I respect it\ 
But I still give you F's for effort\ 
And the A's for me\ 
Extra Credit\ 
How I deflected all praises be\ 
To the most higher I admire\ 
Never will I abide by yourCause your liar and your not my Sire\ 
Cant buy me I just ride by ya\ 
And I won't buy Bye Ya\ 
Ill buy your lighter and set it onfire 
I .... Hate .... You ..... All .... :-) 
Today nobody cares , but oh tomorrow they will\ 
they said my future is dark\ 
see me now\ 
just look around\ 
Im Beaming 
Do you remember me , the guy from verse one ? Failure’s my last name , Never’s my first one You see I hood a lot , and yeah I nerd some Hood’s where the heart is , nerd’s where the words from Don’t represent either , because I merged them ‘S kids who wanna leave , and I encourage them Go out and see the world , never return from Yeah , you don’t come back , unless you learn some 
I've been in the poem of many a poet , \ 
And I reside in the < PROPMALE > of many a < PROPMALE > ist\ 
Some of your sm < PROPMALE > est have tried to < PROPMALE > ictulate\ 
My whole p < PROPMALE > in this\ 
But they're fruitless in their harvestin\ 
The drow grows from my footsteps\ 
I'm the one that they follow 
Relaxing , maybe getting on skype in a lil bit , but for now watching the college game 
Take it for what it is , or leave it for what its not .... \

Through myself First of all accuse myself For being a fool All attempts to school myself have failed To improve means to remove myself From this pool of sharks , dark as the mood I felt I’m losing fuel That’s all the food I refuse myself\ 
That’s how you do when you do yourself And if I lose , I could never excuse myself\ 
When you walk through the garden , you gotta watch your back Well , I beg your pardon , walk the straight and narrow track When you walk with Jesus , he’s gonna save your soul You got to keep the Devil , well you gotta keep him down in the hole . 
Ima make you feel it , like I mispronounced fillet 
Doctors appointment for a note so I can finalllly work again ! Since they lost my first note and havent been letting me work 
People are really starting to bring out the complete asshole in me 
After enough bitching got myself another doctors appointment ... maybe nowwww I can get a fucking note to work .. people seriously make things more complicated then they ever need to be . 
So it turns out the doctors knew what was wrong with me for the past year ... and NEVER told me !!! wtf is wrong with this world 
Its unbelievable , all the little lies people tell for no reason at all . They usually are the same ones who point the finger at others . 
There is much to be said , with little to explain 
now she’s a bright blaze , light rays , a shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape , so lets hear it for our heroine , applaud as our spirits fly into the never end , one closed chapter , it opens up another part so this is more like , the end , question < PROPFIRST > . what happens when people turn to tears , dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years . 
I want to know why after all this time , why you still find ways into my mind ..... 
Going to bed smiling and laughing ... lol your wayyy to funny girl 
Bored beyond belief ! 
Its that factor , the one their missing . The one you got . 
three straight new years Im too sick to even think about going out .. \ 
Have fun everybody 
Its obvious Im not nearly back to full strength , one 8 hour shift at work and Im in so much pain . Watching breaking bad and maybe off to the gym to hit the steam room up .... 
Im going to start using binghamton as an adjective . \ 
Like this day was sooo binghamton ( shitty)\ 
Try using it in your favorite sentences boys and girls . 
The NFL has become a joke , a bitch's league ...!!!! 
Why do I let myself believe things that I know wont happen ... 
Going to bed early , no work tomorrow ! 
Dont say that you feel like dying\ 
Lifes hard and it feels like diamonds 
No matter how many jokes I crack . Somethings I dont find funny . 
Goingg to bedddd\ 
Maybe hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow , if not though does anyone want to meet up and do anything ? Ill be boredddd 
ok so work 2-11 n I thought it was 12-6 ... damnnnn 
work 12-6 ... I really dont wanna go 
I just had one of the best dreams Ive ever had ! Its amazing how real parts of them can be , hopefully most of it will come true one day ;-) <3 
Chillen , watching some weeds since the Chicago game is a blow out\ 
Then Im having to root for the Jets since < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is Lucifer in disguise !

This reminds me all too well of another situation ....

Work ... Home ... Sleep 
A friend of mine asked me '' then what do you believe in ? '' \ 
Where theres a will , theres a way ! 
Got a new cell phone today , get at me if u want the number\ 
<333 
Thinking things will be different is one thing\ 
believing they are different ..... now thats where you get hurt 
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence\ 
Fear is such a weak emotion thats why I despise it\ 
We scared of almost everything , afraid to even tell the truth\ 
So scared of what you think of me , I’m scared of even telling you\ 
Sometimes I’m like the only person I feel safe to tell it to\ 
I’m locked inside a cell in me , I know that there’s a jail in you 
Cant wait for the 2011 NBA All < PROPFEMALE > Weekend ! 
Looking up the state of Alaska , I think Im gonna go out on a journey in the wilderness , get back to nature and just spend a couple weeks out in the middle of nowhere get away from everyone with just myself to rely on ..... sounds fantastic 
Why am I still up at 7am .... 
theres not much to look forward to these days ... 
Lifes hard\ 
and it feels like diamonds 
I wonder if February 15th is the most unromantic day of the year 
Just three weeks away from '' Lasers '' by < PROPFIRST > Fiasco ... beeen a longggggg time coming
