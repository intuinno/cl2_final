Boys can be jerks 
love stinks ! 
I've carried a baby within my body . I've slept with a baby on my chest . I have kissed boo boos , been puked on , peed on , pooped on & spent sleepless nights in a rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a mom , and there is no greater honor or blessing . Make this as your status if you're proud to be a mom ?
