Happy New Year ... I'm going to let go of the past and look forward to the future . Goodbye to ex's , arguments & people who suck ! 

So , < PROPFIRST > just called me . He asks \What would you say if a man asked if he could fuck your mouth dry ? \ " \ 
I want to know who put the clown in my car . Seriously . It's creepy as hell . 
Click through to read my holiday cheer :D 
I need something and don't know what the heck it is . :\\ 
Reinstalling WOW . Inc the crack-pipe . 
Just had a good talk with dad . Sometimes , those do wonders to improve your mood ! 
So , I'm on vent , right ? And < PROPFIRST > Powers is the first voice I hear when I finally get it working right . What are the words out of his mouth ? \Are you going to give her a good night spank ? \ " Nope . I don't think I've missed a beat . " 
Sleep is going to be nonexistant tonight . 
Is anyone else annoyed by the cartoon meme ? Don't get me wrong , I LOVE reminiscing about old school cartoons , but I don't recognize 90% of my friends list now . 
So today was filled with Mexican food ( noms ) , a movie ( Faster . I liked it . ) , kiddo time , nerd-time at the CT thing ( briefly ) and then some awesome IHOP times with Mr. < PROPMALE > , Mr. Beasley , and Mr. ... IDK his last name , so < PROPFIRST > . :D Then ended on the happy note of music in a parked car . I would largely call today a success . :) 
magenta pink hair inc ? all signs point to yes 
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is , that's what you get for waking up in Vegas ... 
Send me a private message with a random number between 1 and 500 , and I'll post a comment with your number and what I think about you . :D 
Has just been told that < PROPFIRST > Cooper < PROPFEMALE > is responsible for the clown in my car a while back . Retribution will not be swift . It will come when he least expects it . 
first snow of the season . barely even dusting but still awesome . 
We're one mistake from being together , so let's not ask why it's not right . We won't be 17 forever , and we can get away with this tonight . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > : \I mean really who cares if I look like a total idiot . Once they seen the gun in my pants no one will say shit . ( HA ! That's what she said . )\ " \ 
Has had a day full of friends , lights , and babies . Mostly babies . I'm blessed to have my friends . 
My daughter just read Green Eggs and Ham , cover to cover without help . 62 pages of pure win . I'm so proud of her . <3 
Oh baby I'm all messed up in you . You're far away , but you're here with me .

There was friday into saturday evening spent with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and the kids , and then work , and then saturday night until now spent with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . We totally rocked out to Zombie Jesus , Cheddar's , the mall , and then McD's so Beybey could play . GOOD weekend is GOOD . 
So I'm rocking some hot chocolate , right ? And listening to \Big Time Rush . \ " I'm slightly addicted to Nickelodeon's boyband creation . I blame having a six year old who obsesses about them . " 
At < PROPFIRST>'s . Was rocking the < PROPFEMALE > balls until about 2 minutes ago when they fell finally . ( Your dirty mind needs to stop . It's from the pink hair dye . ) Oh . And . < PROPFIRST > had 3 women in his bed tonight . True story . 
Now has a portable heater next to her on the back porch . Back porch and I are friends again . :D 
< PROPFEMALE>'s room is finally FINISHED . Like , closet and everything . I feel pretty accomplished . Also found the power supplies to the N64 and Gamecube . Life is good . 
So < PROPFIRST > Cooper < PROPFEMALE > Let me borrow his 40s/big band & swing collections on vinyl and I'm so enthralled I've decided to just download all of it . So here I am , with half a million songs in queue and thoroughly satisfied . 
Fixing to get my Captain < PROPFIRST > Sparrow on with < PROPFIRST > . Night FB 
Work was good , life is good , I miss < PROPFEMALE > . : x WTB < PROPFEMALE > . PST . 
Had a pretty awesome day thus far . 
So let's keep this conversation lingering on . Don't say goodnight , not while I am\ 
Gone . This will be a long , long ride . And I'll be dreaming of coming Home . And when you are alone tonight , I'll be writing you another song . 
Just got her card from her daddy . <3 Also , had hangouts tonight with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and Cat . Interesting conversations abounded . Can't say I minded them . Now , hangouts with < PROPFIRST > . 
So my favorite character of the Fast and Furious franchise ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ) died in Tokyo Drift in a blazing inferno . I realize he reappeared for Fast&Furious4 , as a ' pre-event ' of Tokyo . Cool . But the FAST FIVE is supposed to take place -after- Tokyo . How the deuce is he alive ? Continuity ftl . 
Has had an overall awesome week with friends and such . This weekend is shaping up to be freaking AMAZING to boot . ILY all , and if you don't hear from me until Monday , it's because I'm having fun . :D 
So many birthday wishes and it's only 7:20 in the morning . Thanks guys . I love ya all . <3

The birthday weekend has given way to family in town . ALL FOUR of us girls are in one town . Let's see how this recipe for disaster plays out . So far so good . >.> \ 
Making lots of baked deliciousness , while we wait for news on PopPop . I know I've been ignoring facebook lately . It's nothing personal , just rarely at a computer ever . So yah . You want me , text me . 
Since I absolutely won't be online for the remainder of the weekend ( I haven't been on much at all , I suppose in a while ) < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS , HAPPY NEW YEAR , get sloshed , love someone , forgive someone , and fall in love with someone ( again !!! ) . I love ya'll . :)
