Kids with special needs aren't weird or odd . They only want what everyone wants ... to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week & Autism Awareness Month , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you are faced with it
