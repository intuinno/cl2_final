I will not allow myself to let this year go to waste ! There's my resolution ! RIP to PELAGIO < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Daquip ' s cousins , < PROPMALE > Ebalaroza & < PROPFIRST > Dacoscos & < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Miller ' s Aunt/Grandma , my flaws and regrets I hope to never see them this year , and I PRAY for ALL you ! BYAH ! 

GRILL ! 
Pickin MJ up , Nd a caffine fix . What 2 drink ? < PROPFIRST>'s CluB B packed ! 
OMG , Late night FBing w/Lala is tiring 
Gentle-men BOARD-MEETING #3 will be discussed strictly under TEXT MESSAGING ONLY ! Be prepared for an improvement and I hope your off the next day for it . Besides , we will do this one with VENGEaNCE ! TIP IT ! TIP IT ! 
At Target , family shopping while I study at Starbucks . Brother made a special concuction iced tea . Coffee is bad right now , although very tempting ! Too much accounts to refresh my memory , gotta concentrate . 
Not Afraid ! 
Bought < PROPFEMALE > the 4G Evo , tested out the 4G hotspot with the Laptop , iTouch , regular phone , and PSP . This thang rocks . It's definitely coming to the beach with the MacBook . Woohoo ! Lovin ' It ! 
So Sick and Tired and Hungery and Angery 
getting tired right now , i am waiting for light to turn off , i feel like i need to knock < PROPFEMALE > out , it might be the only way i will actually go to sleep , < PROPFEMALE > la is staring at me wondering how i am using the speech to text thing , now we feel like old fart speakers we don't want to go out tonight , good night everybody ! 
insane in the membrane , i gotta sleep but i gotta study . 
Nodding my head to some tunes while studying . Can't wait til this GRILL is over ! 
Feeling sick to the stomach . Burning Up ! Nurse < PROPFEMALE > , thank you for taking care of me baby . 
Starting to feel better ... look out world ! I've missed a lot and I'm taking it out on those who take advantage of the weak . Someone's AZZ is getting SMACKED ! 
Thank you all for coming to La's Pajama < PROPFEMALE > Jam party , it's always a treat to have you all over . We love you all , weather here , there and else where . God Bless ! 
Study Now , Grilling Tomorrow ! 
.... AND MY SAUSAGE ! 
I'm gonna put her OUT ! 
Everyone loves a good night sleep . 
Outbacks BOUND ! 
Don't you hate it when something you have has your FULL name on it , yet others still disregard it and take ? I also hate when I can't talk about it ! 
At Masa for a Grad Party then D&B's! 
Left Pali , OTW2 Valley of the < PROPFEMALE > then headed through the north shore coasting through the sites for Jojo's Journey Jamin ! 
We just got slapped with some Pads , I think one of them has a drawing of a penis . 2Funny ! 
Can't wait for sum SHRIMP PLATE ! OMG ! OMG ! OMG ! OMG ! -Usher ft . Will . I . Am 
At Cholos Now ! MARGARITAS and MUCHACHAS ! CHEEHOO ! 
PREDATORS ! 
Shake it , not like a polaroid picture ! 
Ah ! 
INCEPTION was DECEPTIVELY STUPENDOUS ! Even < PROPFEMALE > understood the whole movie ! Go figuire ? It's most definitely worth watching , wouldn't mind even saying \ I Should\ " watch it in 3D/IMAX with some friends . " 
Feeling really pissed-off ! Not so much discouraged but offended and not in anyway wanting to compromise with those who are big headed and very ignorant . 
I wish I could choke the sh ! t out of peoples heads and watch the crap leak out of their nose till there is nothing left but room to shove some humbleness and humility to shame them in front of others . 
True human nature is always a mystery and complex to understand . You can only produce so much < PROPFEMALE > till there is nothing left but the poor bastard who talks about what's wrong . Rather than complain , be the smart bastard who corrects . 
I wish I had a flaming sword to strike down vengeance and justice upon those who would dare corrupt and poison innocence . This world has too many selfish people who take others for granted and are unwilling to realize how lucky they are to be alive . 
I feel for those who want to make a difference in the world . Envy those who would be heroes , I say pity those who need them . Self proclaimed heroes are glorified to the point of vanity , feeding off of attention and praise from others . 
If there is anything I learned while working in the military , it's do the right thing even when no one is looking . Would you be satisfied when someone praises you ? Rather than expect emotional or physical reward , try and give the world a reason to live for you . 
I despise ignorance , I find it distasteful . Be aware of my presence , I share no promises or rewards . I will provide the truth and I do not expect those around me to swallow it . 
I pray that those reading this take the initiative to make a difference in someone else's life . They could be a direct correlation to your happiness or a venomous downfall of your life . 
Don't continue to be the blind fools of maniacal trends , allow yourself to admit to personal flaws . Everyone's so concerned with what's wrong with themselves , you are only as perfect as what you are now . A Precious Life ! 
First time JuryDuty , next is who will they choose ? 2-3 days tops . 
Waiting on the 8th floor @ Jury Duty , phones off . I feel like < PROPFEMALE > vu ? I dreamt this situation before , Jury here I come ! 
Lunch is ovah ! Back to the court , Jury Duty is highly interesting ! Can't wait to find out if I'm here tomorrow ... oooooo boy ! 
Jury Duty was very interesting , all I did was sit and wait to be chosen , out of 43 people I had to be the last one ..... not to be part of the pool . At least it was a learning experience , I think everyone should part take in this , it's a test of your < PROPFEMALE > ! All in all what an adventure , not !
