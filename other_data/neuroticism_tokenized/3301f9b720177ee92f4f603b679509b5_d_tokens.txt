School was so freakin boring and it was long . I definitely don't like 3rd period and I'm not too crazy about 2nd either ... 
\I can't breathe without you but I have to ... \"" 
Ugh . I can't believe I made it through the second day of school . I like it , but its sooooo long . When it felt like class was almost over , we actually had an hour left . That is so not cool . Drafting homework and studying for english quiz on nouns . 
really really tired ... 
Is it supposed to be easier to please the world , or myself ? Cuz right now I can't seem to please either one ... 
\I've got an I <3 ? written on the back of my hand ... \"" 
I miss someone a lot right now ... But it'll never be the same , so I have to be strong and let go ... 
Well the Panthers suck 
I have never been so happy :) 
I was playing soccer and i knocked the air vent thing into the crawl space under the house . I also hit the gutter . It got knocked it off the side of the house . Then I hit the other gutter and it was knocked off the side of the house too ... and the ball left a dent . Clearly I don't know my own strength ... 
Today was just one of those days ... :/ 
Bored ... Text meee 980 521 9198

Red Sox got swept by the Angels ... That makes me mad . 
Owl City is beast !!

\I'm here without you baby but you're still on my lonely mind i think about you baby and i dream about you all the time ... \""

Every once in a while ppl step up they rise above themselves . Sometimes they surprise u , and sometimes they fall short . Life is funny sometimes , it can push pretty hard but if you look close enough you find hope in the words of children , in the bars of a song and in the eyes of someone you love . And if you're lucky , and if you're the luckiest person on this entire planet , the person you love decides to love you back . 
got a new hat and some new music . life is good . 
Last games of basketball this week . Wish it wasn't over so fast . I'm gonna miss hangin ' out with the team . 
Sometimes it doesn't matter what i do , it's never good enough for you 
Ask me anything !!!! http://formspring.me/bballplaya12 
float like a butterfly , sting like a < PROPFEMALE > 
Every memory of lookin out the back door , I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor , Its hard to say it , time to say it , goodbye , goodbye , Every memory of walking out the front door , I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin for , Its hard to say it , time to say it , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye 
You're never gonna be alone from this moment on , If you ever feel like letting go , I won't let you fall , When all hope is gone , I know that you can < PROPFEMALE > on , We're gonna see the world out , I'll hold you ' til the hurt is gone 
just got home . broke down and started crying my eyes out in the restaurant ... way to show your amazing inner strenghth < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I just spent all morning scanning pictures to the computer and having a longgg talk with my brother 
had an interesting discussion with my parents about religion . 
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take , but by the moments that take our breath away . 
http://www.formspring.me/bballplaya12 
finally done with my history project that wasnt even assigned to me by my teacher ... go figure . 
I'm tired . 
silence speaks louder than words 
Every song ends but is that any reason not to enjoy the music ? 
people always leave .. but sometimes .. they come back 
Missing you gets easier everyday even though it's one day longer since the last time i saw you it's one day closer to the next time i will .

“Wise men speak because they have something to say ; Fools because they have to say something . ” ~ Plato

I'm my own worst enemy .. 
They say eavesdroppers never hear anything good of themselves .. 
bored outta my mind ... need plans to get outta the house for a while . 
Leave my door open just a crack , ' Cause I feel like such an insomniac , Why do I tire of counting sheep , When I'm far too tired to fall asleep ... 
Life's too short not to tell them how you feel . 
That's me in the corner , That's me in the spotlight , Losing my religion , Trying to keep up with you , And I don't know if I can do it , Oh no I've said too much , I haven't said enough , I thought that I heard you laughing , I thought that I heard you sing , I think I thought I saw you try

Really pissed off about the game ... and some other stuff ... No big deal though . It's whatever :/ 
is tired of trying to live up to impossible expectations . I'm only human . I make mistakes . I'm not even close to perfect . And my best never seems good enough for anyone . I can't make everyone happy and I know not everyone likes me . I am who I am , and if that's not good enough for you , then don't try to bring me down . Just get out of my life . 
Je t'aime <3 
I swear I'll always be here for you .. 
\Tell me you love me or lose me forever ... \"" 
Mom : You're such a pyromaniac Me : No I'm not . I just really like fire :) 
had fun tonight but it would have been more fun if my bffe < PROPFIRST > Wiles was there !! 
There is a tide in the affairs of men . Which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune ; Omitted , all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries . On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves , Or lose our ventures . ~ William Shakespeare

I dont wanna see you anymore , Im just not that strong , I love it when youre here , But Im better when you're gone , Im certain that Ive given and oh how you can take , Theres no use in you lookin , Theres nothin left for you to break , Please release me , We both know that you dont need me , Let my heart rest in pieces

They say a true friend can go long periods of time without speaking & never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but that you will always love them . Re-post if you are lucky to have at least one of these friends , I am privileged to say I do !!!!!

Didn't feel good at school . Didn't feel good at practice . First game tomorrow at East Rowan . Hope I'm feeling better by then . 
Game at Lake < PROPFIRST > today ! Pretty pumped up about it . 
When I am silent , they want me to speak . When I speak , I am not heard . 
SUPER SQUIRREL ! 
First home game of the season tomorrow against Hopewell at 4:00 . Really pumped up and ready to help the team get our first win . 
When in doubt , write it out . :/

Got a mild concussion at the game last night . So pissed off that I can't practice for a while . Will probably miss the Central game next week . I hate my life >:( 
Going to church for some Christmas program thing . 
Having a hard time accepting that I won't be playing tomorrow because of my stupid concussion . Central better watch out though cuz I think my team can beat them without me anyways . I'll be cheering for you on the bench Spiders ! :) 
Going to the doctor today to get cleared to play basketball again . 
Is officially cleared to get back on the court :) 
\Why so serious ? \ " :) <3 " 
Pumped up for our home game tomorrow against mt . pleasant !

Home game against Central tomorrow . Didn't get to play them last time because of my concussion but this time I'ma tear it up on the courttt ! They don't stand a < PROPMALE > ! ;) 
Beat Central 45-22 and got my season high in scoring with 11 points . Can't say I didn't warn them ! :) 
Beat Northwest again 27-24 . Got a tech right after halftime for elbowing a girl in the face and had to sit out for the rest of the game . Hopefully I won't make another stupid move like that tomorrow against Cox Mill . 
I think it's safe to say it is not my week . 
I swear I have got to get out of here RIGHT NOW . I need a break ! >:( 
I'm having a REALLY hard time accepting that basketball is coming to an end . I want my team to know that I've been playing sports since I was 3 and this is by far the best team I have ever been a part of . Tomorrow's the last game , so let's leave it all on the court . 
Can't sleep ... again . 
Tired of you building my hopes up just to tear them down ... not looking forward to tomorrow . 
Day 1 of softball went better than expected . Looking forward to tomorrow . :D 
Softball scrimmages all day tomorrow . 
Getting new books makes me happy :) 
If you want something bad enough , you will be willing to take a risk to get it . If you're not willing to take the risk , well then I guess you didn't really want it that bad . 
Ready for the game tomorrow ! 
Softball game todayyy ! :) 
Game against Central today .
