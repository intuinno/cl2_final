I've just been hired by examiner.com to write at least four stories a week about the Salt Lake dating scene . They say you should write what you know , don't they ? I'm excited !

Just watched a soldier home from Iraq on leave , surprise his daughter at school . They hadn't seen each other for nearly a year . She jumped into his arms and it seems they would hug forever . And who says TV is a vast wasteland ? I'm going to have a good cry now . 
Here I am up at 8 a.m. on Sunday , thinking it's 9 a.m. Circadian rhythms are a wonderful thing . 
Thank you < PROPMALE > Phillips and the entire coaching staff and players of the < PROPFIRST > Cowboys . FINALLY a playoff win ! It's been a long drought . Everything from here is gravy and excuse me if I truly believe that the way my Cowboys are playing , WE CAN GO ALL THE WAY ! How ' bout dem COWBOYS ! 
When the only phone you have is your cell phone , losing it is really inconvenient . 
Congratulations to < PROPFIRST > Favre and the Vikings who crushed my Cowboys today . Should be interesting the next time they play . And this kind of loss really motivates a team during the off-season . 
You know you're getting old when one of your children asks what you plan to do when you can't take of your self anymore . 
Thank you friends and family ( ok , my two boys -- I don't have much family ) for your support . I appreciate your notes and chats of advice and encouragement . God bless you all ! 
It's a tough job market for writers . I've got 20 years of public relations experience in the public and private sectors ( including almost 15 years of senior management ) , five years of legal writing work , and more than two years as a journalist , most of that running a newspaper or a radio station news organization . And here I am looking for sales , service and < PROPMALE > labor work . 
Googled my best high school friend and discovered he's dead . Been dead for working on three years . We haven't been close for more than 20 years , so it isn't a surprise that I didn't know . He dealt with a rare adult-onset form of Muscular Dystrophy through most of his adult life . < PROPMALE > was 51 . 
I spent Friday night taking Flickster quizzes . Ok . I officially have no life . I'm officially pathetic . There is one challenging quiz that I will not post here . But my mother-in-law took it and she beat me on time . She really shouldn't have . * grins * 
Been hired to work on Sen. < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s campaign staff ! I was raised in Henderson just north of the Senator's hometown , worked on Sen. < PROPMALE>'s earliest campaigns and know NV well . Communications Director , Rodell Mollineau is impressed with my background , my writing and especially with how well I dealt with Republicans here in Utah . Sen. < PROPMALE > needs my kind of help . I'm excited to go home ! 
Part of me is really pleased that I pulled off my best APRIL FOOLS STUNT since \Church Buys Westminster\ " led my college newspaper in 1977 . Another part of me is heartened that so many of my friends cared that I got a great -- albeit faux -- job with Sen. < PROPMALE > . Yet another part of me wishes that I actually had that good a job . I hope I didn't offend anyone . I'm not much of a prankster but this was a doozy . " 
Baseball season has started and along with the usual boring cliches I heard MLB Network analyst < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > drop a line that I hadn't heard before . Some slugger had pounded a really long , hard home run and < PROPMALE > came up with , \Check that ball for tears . \"" 
For me , watching golf is right up there with watching paint dry . But the < PROPMALE > championships are somehow special . This year's Masters was supposed to be about the return of Tiger . But in the end it was an emotional triumph of a family man who won the thing for his wife who's surviving breast cancer . Thank God for people like < PROPMALE > Mickelson . Bless him and everyone like him and his family . 
May 1 , 2010 -- Going to a casting call ( yes , < PROPFEMALE > I may be hired as a movie extra ! ) and then to meet with my Westminster College friends for yet another session of food , drink and reminiscing . 
Through some dear friends and much ccnotemplation and prayer , I may be coming out of my five to ten year dark night of the soul . I've remembered that I'm a spirit here to gain human experience and most importantly , I've embraced the truth that angels surround me to help me communicate and know God . < PROPMALE>'s song , \It's About Time\ " is ringing in my soul . " 
Getting ready for the return trip to Utah from beautiful D . C .. I've loved watching my son , < PROPFIRST > , graduate from Gallaudet University and now we're going on a ROAD TRIP !!! 
shared a laugh with my son during our recent cross-country 2000-plus road trip . At one stop along I-80 in Nebraska there were two competing stations with the same price , one an independent and the other a BP Oil station . NOBODY was at the BP station -- you know , the folks who brought you the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ? Consumers DO get it ! YES !

To all my friends who are blessed enough to be fathers -- I hope you're having a great day ! This week has taught me the gift of family , friends and angels . I've learned that you can't love the first enough , ask ( and * gulp * accept ) enough from the second and communicate too much with the third . Thank you , God !

calls upon all people of good conscience to converge upon the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville , Florida , to peacefully and prayerfully express your concerns to Pastor < PROPFIRST > Jones and his congregation . Perhaps this man of God will hear our prayers so that God may tell him that his first inclination to burn Qurans on September 11 wasn't such a good idea after all . Feel free to tag this and pass it on . 
is happy that Pastor < PROPFIRST > Jones called off the Quran burning today . Sept . 11 should forever be a day of peace . My work day started with a moment of silence . Blessings to the planet and we who share it . Peace . 
danced with < PROPFEMALE > last night . Great fun ! Gotta find funky dance bar though ... had to leave Club 90 when they tried to play MJ's \Billie Jean . \ " Truly sad . < PROPMALE > at < PROPFIRST>'s Dance spun better funk . I held to my promise never to set foot at a < PROPFIRST>'s Dance again w/o a date . Good to see < PROPFEMALE > Fronberg and < PROPFIRST > there . Hearkened to the old Wednesday nights at The Bay .

The wedding was amazing . < PROPFEMALE > was stunning . I love her with all my heart . The reception at Lugano's was great food , dancing and lots of good friends ! Just got back from our honeymoon in Midway . Missed most of the blizzard and enjoyed a blissful couple of days together . Pics will be up soon . Thank you all for being so kind and loving to us , especially our families and friends who helped so much . 
is up at the University of Utah hospital waiting for Mom to get out of surgery . She fell yesterday afternoon and broke her hip . She's 77 and has Alzheimer's . I found out hours after she was admitted and not from the facility where she fell . I'm not happy . I expect her to do well and hope to find a different living situation for her . 
Mom's out of surgery and will be in her room in 45 minutes . Her bones are poor from osteoporosis but her surgeon recommends meds to build them and therapy to strengthen Mom's core . Women in my family live to their 90s . Wish she had the mind to enjoy it . 
decided on a rehab/long-term care facility for Mom . Monday was a bad night . She doesn't tolerate pain meds or anesthetic well . She's been in and out all day . This isn't pleasant for someone who has no idea where she is or why she's where she is from one minute to the next . Thank you for your prayers , assistance and kind thoughts . As for me , this is SO much easier with a wife who cares and friends like you .

is saddened at the passing of < PROPFEMALE > Edwards . She was the perfect political wife . Smart , funny , attentive . She didn't suffer from cancer , rather , she survived for many years . And when < PROPFIRST>'s infidelity was revealed she didn't suffer through that , either . At the end she even found the grace and dignity to make peace with him . I will never forget her . God bless you , < PROPFEMALE > Edwards . 
visited Mom at her rehab facility today . She's doing much better . Thanks to everyone for your good wishes . Last week was rough but she's doing much better now . 
is home with my new little family thinking of my kids and loved ones who've passed physically and spiritually . Wishing you all who celebrate it a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
is enjoying his first day off in nine days and happily enjoying my new nights and two days off in a row schedule ! Took < PROPFEMALE > to lunch and am doing a movie tonight . 
is listening to the debate about the killings in Tuscon last Saturday . The 24-hour news machines are spewing but they're missing the point . This isn't about guns , politics or a deranged person . We so busy with our anger that we aren't taking care of each other and thus , those who really need help -- such as a deranged person with a gun -- aren't being helped . I want focus on that . I want resources put there . 
was enjoying my first wallyball game in two , maybe three years today when I hurt my knee . After seeing the doctor , it may be no worse than a sprain ( I hope ) . I'll know more after the MRI early next week . Typical me , I just want it to get better so I can play some more . 
isn't happy about the MRI results . Seems I have a torn ACL and MCL with some cartilage damage . TOSH is going to review the pictures on Wednesday morning ( the earliest appointment ) and we'll see what happens from there . Other than the pain , I'm walking almost normally and there hasn't been much swelling at all . Taking Lortab sucks . Being laid up sucks . 
is scheduled for surgery on Tuesday . Seems I'm only in need of an ACL repair . The other ligaments are fine . It's an easy in and out surgery ( right ) with a relatively short convalescence .

is literally resting comfortably after ACL reconstruction . I have almost no pain and my wonderful pain is the best nurse I've ever had . My lovely stepdaughter even came over to give me a hug and I've heard from all three of my kids . I feel loved and well cared for . Kudos to Dr. West at TOSH and the staff there . 
Day two after ACL reconstruction is better than how I felt on day one . Still no pain . Able to put more and more weight on the leg . The post op exercises are easier . Flexibility is good . Sleep was a pain . I don't normally sleep on my back . Still got more than eight hours . Thanks for all your good wishes . :) 
One Tea Party presidential hopeful says that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Adams ended slavery in his lifetime and another says that Sputnik bankrupted the USSR . I've said it before and I'm gonna keep saying it : I want a President at least as smart as I am . Hell , I want one at least as smart as a high school graduate ! They say they're experts on the Constitution ? Hell , they can't even get American History dates straight . Morons . 
I enjoyed my first day with Discover Financial Services . Am looking forward to putting my Inbound Acquisitions experience to good use . 
Just got back from my physical therapy appointment . I'm recovering well . Extension is excellent . Flexion isn't what it should be but is still good enough that I'm going to start stationary biking . Pain is minimal . No drugs except anti-inflammatories . 
The Jazz stunk it up last night ( nothing new ) despite a < PROPMALE > Corbin's debut as head coach ( very new ) . The officiating sucked ( nothing new ) and the seats were too close for my repaired knee ( nothing new ) . I had to walk too far to get to the ESR ( nothing new ) and there were lots of Suns fans ( highly unusual ) . < PROPFEMALE > had a lot to drink ( rare ) and is complaining this morning that the cats are very loud ( VERY FUNNY ! ) . 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day hasn't been all that big a deal for me in the past ten years or so for a variety of reasons . This year my beautiful wife has made me a believer again . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > for being so loving and pure and making me feel like a romantic again . \

Sorry , I haven't been on much today . I've been ill . Thanks so much to all of you for the birthday wishes . You're all very kind . 
Strange . I woke up the morning of my birthday with a nasty pain at my waist . Quickly I realized it was another kidney stone ( same problem back in 2005 ) . I made it to work , checked out to the doctors where I spent all day dealing with it -- almost . The 9mm x 9mm stone requires blasting which couldn't be done yesterday . That happens Monday Oddly , the there's no pain today . Knock wood , I hope it stays that way . 
It's annoying to be told by one health care professional that you have one large kidney stone , then going to the \specialist\ " to be told that you have \ " two or three\ " that need to be eliminated . Then you have the procedure to eliminate them and end up with one \ " maybe\ " done and afterwards you strain your urine daily for weeks only to get indistinguishable bits of grit to prove that nothing much was done to you .
