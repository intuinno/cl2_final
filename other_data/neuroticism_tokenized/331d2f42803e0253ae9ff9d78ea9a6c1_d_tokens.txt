You only worry about yourself now a days , you don't care about how I feel or what I did today , but a good friend would . 
I have those who love me and those who hate me . I know I can not make everyone happy , and I am perfectly okay with that . Live Love Forget :)

I really don't want to make my dad breakfast , he should just get off his lazy butt and do it himself , I mean that's what he would say to me . 
How do I convince my parents to get me a phone ?! 
Kinda Feeling SicK Not Good :/ 
You make it hard to forget you ... 
The girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4 hrs a night . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting on makeup hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put as your status if you're against bullying !!! 
Getting off Facebook ... for now . 
I don't hate you , I never could . I don't regret meeting you , I never will . But I do regret our relationship . It destroyed the best thing we had , our friendship . All I could wish for at the moment is to have back what we lost . 
I Can't Live Everyday To The Fullest If Your Not Here ... 
I love how stupid you look right now :) 
Connecting with people from elementary school , it's weird . 
Never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about ... 
When people say lol people don't actually \laugh out loud . \"" 
Calling in the forces , about to dye my hair for the first time :] For those of you who don't know I'm dye it red !!

You made me smile . (: \ 
But nothing lasts forever . \ 
Only for a while . \ 
Better late than never . \ 
What is love ? ? \ 
Do any of us really know ? \ 
Push and shove , \ 
Easy come easy go . 
Goodnight Sweet Dreams (:

How come the person who caused you the tears is the only person who can fix them ? 
About to go to Jazz Band . Battle of the Books today ! 
Tomorrow is April Fools and the jokes on you ... or is it ? (: 
I said I was gonna do something tomorrow , I know I'm gonna regret it . ): 
I do regret doing what I did , but then again , it was probably for the best , and we always learn from our mistakes (: 
Think I may have majority pissed off one of my friends for April Fools , the one day they actually take a joke seriously/personally . 
Is starting this story and wants you to keep it going using 5 words or less . Once upon a time , long , long ago .... 
< PROPFIRST > Rhymes , right when I was about to IM you , you got off , you have always had the best sense of timing . :/ 
Didn't get to got to the movies like I wanted to but that's okay , at least I get to see my friends tomorrow (: 
Looking forward to trying to fix things between us (: 
I would just like to say love you everyone ! ? Goodnight Facebook ! :) 
I'm at < PROPFEMALE>'s (: 
Almost ready to go to my concert at North , I don't really want to go :/ 
Two of my most common skills , tripping on flat surfaces , and sarcasm . (: 
I am not perfect\ 
Far from ever be . \ 
World full of neglect , \ 
You have eyes , but cannot see . \ 
All this pain you put me through , \ 
Something just draws me in . \ 
I am me and you are you , \ 
That’s all it’s ever been . \ 
An original poem by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > (:

Do you know why Facebook is blue and white ? Because the creator < PROPFIRST > Zuckerberg has red-green color blindness , but he can see blue (: 
< PROPFEMALE > Black has officially brainwashed me . Friday is not the worst song I have heard , but it's not great either , I can't stop replying it , I want to but I can't! D:

I really really need to upload some new photos . Tonight ... Tomorrow ... Idk . (: 
All of us have a thousand wishes to be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's butt . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , is fighting cancer , or has beaten cancer , post this for at least an hour . 
I don't have anything to do on Facebook , so I am getting off , then again , I don't have anything to do off of Facebook . Confused D: 
2 great things happened today . \ 
#1 I found out tutoring ends Wednesday of next week ! (: \ 
#2 He gave me a hug today , and did I mention , he smelled GOOD ! 
Today , I found a little baby ducky , without a mom , and he/she was so helpless , alone , and kept getting tossed around in the rapids at Mill Creek . The other ducks were trying to eat him/her ! D: Little Chirp I hope you are with your mom right now ! Feel guilty for not helping Chirp . Yes , I gave him/her a name ! 
Forgot today was Silent Day at Parrish ... looking forward to it , then again I'm not :/ Going all natural today , no makeup and unstyled hair . (: 
Confused ! What just happened ? Yeah , I know I haven't always been there when you need me , but I'm trying . I just need sometime to adjust , figure out what I want and what I need in my life . 
Bored . Want to dye my hair back to blonde ... or maybe brown , I really don't like having orange hair ! D: Also wanna get my hair cut , I feel to plain , I need constant change in my life , otherwise I get bored . (:

I'm attending Free Love Day : Draw a Heart on Your Wrist , Change the World ! I want everyone to attend it too ! (: 
Today , I bought a new chapstick , because I gave < PROPFIRST > Rhymes my old one (: 
Gonna get my haircut , problem is the only place my dad will take me is someplace I don't know the name or address of ... :/ This might take awhile . 
My computer is so slow , I hate it . >:/ 
You give me the kind if feeling people write novels about ... :) ? 
I call you , you make some excuse not to talk , I see you in the hallway , I wave to you and you don't wave back , I have been trying to make a better effort , but what's the point if you don't want anything to do with me . :/ 
Apparently , I'm a retard ... In a good way . (: 
Stupid Facebook , you make me lose my focus , I wanted to go to bed an hour and twenty minutes ago . >:/
