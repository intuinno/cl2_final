There's something wrong with me chemically , Something wrong with me inherently . The wrong mix in the wrong genes . I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means .

Well I fumbled for a pencil/And my I'm so sorry pad/And I wrote until I sprained my stupid brain/Well you know that there's a reason I made this up so fast/I though I'd never get a < PROPMALE > to say/What's on my mind , I'm never kind/When my vocabulary's secondary to a bottle of wine ... I never knew the difference between bullshit and sincere/As long as it sounded good while coming out-Butch < PROPMALE > \Promise \""

i forgot how much i enjoy listening to the Replacements .. [ = 
i love music that makes me feel paranoid and puts me on edge but at the same time relaxes me and puts my mind at ease ... [: 
My mind had formed a mental prison , I cried aloud n o-o ne would listen . Then floating through the heavy mist , My vision took a sudden twist/ Empty people stood in grey , Children laughing far away , An empty courtyard wept alone , Rain lashed down on darkened stone/ A < PROPFEMALE > glove points to the door , A threshold I had crossed before , On turning back all I could see , Were her footprints on the sea ...

anybody got any suggestions for music i should listen to/download ?

off to Taste of Thai and High Museum of < PROPMALE > for valentines day ( museum is free and we're splitting the meal ) [= then tomorrow biology and The English Patient :P 
When this boredom wears me out , Then the sky begins to cloud , Sleeping with my ball and chain , When she cries I take the blame/ And pride is just another way , Of trying to live with my mistakes , Denial is a better way , Of getting through another day , And silence is another way , Of saying what I wanna say , And lying is another way , Of hoping it will go away ..... When I'm down I drive the hearse 
really wishes her nose would stop bleeding at night/in the morning ... :P 
Everyone is always saying ' embrace your true self ' .... but what if your ' true self ' is an annoying asshole ?
