Mmm 

agrees that Creech could very possibly be part bear . She then wonders how a bear could interbreed with a dog ... tis a mystery . 
would then like to state that she thinks that Miley could very possibly be crossed with a dear . Nature is a wonderous thing . 
would now like to correct herself , it's spelled deer . EPIC FAIL . 
Happy Halloween ! 
You WISH you were as lame as I was ! Gosh . Well you can't be . So now , the important question is : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > vs . Mr. T ? Who would win ? 
I JUST LOST THE GAME . SO YOU JUST LOST THE GAME . 
I have a question . Which do you think is the plural version of wenis : Wenises or Weni . I seriously think it should be Weni :| and therefore Peni . English classes just lied to us . 
The Game . 
WTF ! I just clicked on what I thought was Birds and the Bees by Breathe < PROPFEMALE > , to get the pokemon theme song XD 
I wish I wasn't so fricken stupid . Which also brings me to the point where I wish there were places you could just pay to SMASH things . They'd make a lot of money . New business plan ? I think so :| 
It's hard to explain something like the game to an adult . You know . It just takes the fun out it , because they really don't have any idea why you find it funny , and look at you as though you might be insane . I can't help it if its just enjoyable to make someone lose , does that not just make sense ? 
I'm officially a SENIOR . :] Can't wait for my report card tomorrow . Gosh darn it , I want my Algrebra score ... 
I like how , liking the group ' you ' says ' You like you . \ I do like me . Thank you . " 
RIP Coach Shaw :( 
Watching Doctor Who , because I'm cool . Phew . I'm tired though . 
Good to be home , though it was fun to < PROPFEMALE > out at my Aunts . Glad to see my cousin graduate xD now to work on my painting 
Must go clean some more . My room is a disaster . I'll be lucky if I don't get sucked into my closet . 
I love you Alex . \ 
\Though if he WAS < PROPFEMALE > 
Can't stop laughing . Just learned there's such a thing as the Boner Awards . Given only to people that make stupid mistakes . Thank you < PROPFIRST > Boner for living up to your name . 
Just realized that people probably can't see who I am , past my Boner fan and all . So when I request new friends , all they see is Boner . Haha . I almost feel bad . 
WOOHOO\ 
IT'S SOCCER TIME . If my mothers yelling now , at the South Africa v . Mexico match , then she sure as hell will be yelling tomorrow when its \ 
US v . UK . I'll be lucky if I don't lose my hearing . This will be a fun \ 
Soccer filled day ! 
BOOYAH . I predicted the first soccer games score correctly . :P It was a draw , with the score being one x one . Hopefully my predictions for the second , are just as correct . We shall see ... 
I JUST LOST THE GAME . DARN YOU EVERY DAY LIFE AND YOUR INNOCENT MENTIONS OF THE GAME . 
Just found out there's a katherineclarke.com \ 
I'm not sure if I should be enthused , or afraid . 
Nap . Yes , a nap sounds good ... 
\Squeeze his ass son 
We have a nurse ? I wasn't actually aware we had a nurse at Sycamore . 
DOCTOR WHO IS ON <3 
Busy yelling at the TV . \ 
THAT'S JUST ONE LESS OF YOUR RACE , MAN D: Does she not realize that ? 
I have a theory that this ' < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > GOTH ' has a man crush on the Doctor . 
THE CRACK . 
I just lost the game . Thank you facebook , thank you . 
Doctor Who comes on at three :] Yay < PROPFIRST > Tennant ! 
I LOST THE GAME ;.; AGAIN . 
I love Gabby Stokes . 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > the Vampire Slayer . \ 
I used to feel sorry for < PROPFEMALE > . Until she pushed a guy down the stairs . Because of some guy she suddenly fell in love with . I hope there's some demonic reason for being such a crazy bitch . Only in television would there be a reason for that . 
Is that a ninja on < PROPFEMALE > the Vampire Slayer ? 
I lost the game again . Stupid facebook . 
Sad my Animal Crossing date with Gabby fell through , but its alright <3 ' cause we'll play tomorrowww . 
< PROPFIRST > MADE ME LOSE THE GAME . 
Knock Knock , \ 
Who's there ? \ 
Doctor\ 
Doctor Who ? \ 
That's right baby 
And the Fired Up comment . I'm sorry Fired Up was the greatest movie ever made , and was very dirty with it's so called ' PG-13\ rated humor . " 
Just realized she actually needs the cord to her Ipod before she can hook it up to Itunes and put ' I Believe in a Thing Called Love ' by The Darkness on it . Fail . 
It's always that ONE time when you're actually typing something you DON'T want to lose , that the power goes out . I'm so mad . Stupid falty electricity , it's not like it's raining cats and dogs out there :/ its < PROPFEMALE > . 
Sat singing to the Beegees and Bowling for Soup , while threatening the air with the lightsaver on my ipod . Yeah . 
Gabby called me emo because my bangs cover my eyes . No way , I just enjoy not being able to see . 
I feel my old addiction coming on ... 
Feeling kind of down . Its one of those days , where everything goes down hill , like my pants tripping me up the stairs , for the second time in a matter of days . I fear they plot against me ... 
Darn you < PROPFIRST > and your typo of game instead of day . I just lost the game . Thank you . 
\Don't let the pedoshark getcha\ " - < PROPFIRST > \ 
It sucks when you notice you screwed up the year you get out of your school , gave to leave the network , and when you try to join it again , you suddenly need someone to confirm you actually go to that school . Too bad I already added all the people that possibly know I even exist at Sycamore . It's not like I've gone a whole semester in a class , and people sitll not know who I was , no ... not at all . 
Alright , I'm done with my questions . Because I swear everytime I got something lovey dovey , it was a question about my mum . Awkward questioning FTW xD\ 
Back to attempting to draw < PROPFEMALE > Gillan and < PROPMALE > Smith . 
Dear Facebook , \ 
Don't ask me how I would propose to Gabby Stokes , if you're not going to even post it on her wall to see . I know it wasn't the best proposal , but come on . You're just jealous of our love . You're jealous that I would take her to Burger < PROPMALE > , and hide her ring in a Hershey's pie . 
I've lost the game three times today . Curses . 
Likes that her father gave her $6.55 just so if he happens to ask me for money tomorrow , he knows i have some . Therefore if I say \No . \ " he knows I'm lying . " 
\Why doesn't McDonald's sell hot dogs as well as hamburgers ? \ " \ 
\Why won't you go faster !? \ " - Me talking to a fan\ 
is worried that Gabby might be killing < PROPFIRST > without my being able to see it . Just my luck , he does something to make her mad that causes Skype to disconnect , so I can't see the murder first hand . 
Gabby keeps coming on to me on Skype . xD 
can't believe she stayed up until 4:10 am talking to Gabby on Skype . \ 
Accomplishments = 7 hour chat , watching A Very Potter Musical , and nothing else 
\God < PROPFIRST > what are you doing in here that's taking so long ? \ " - Anya\ 
A tollfree number just called , I had an incredible urge to < PROPMALE > roll them . But YouTube was not avaliable and I don't know half the words . One day I'll subject them to a horribly tuned < PROPMALE > Astly song , and they'll never call again . 
:) It's good to be able to look back at pictures and videos of Magic , and just smile as I recall her fondly . It seems like its getting easier to just look at things , and be happy we ever had her , without getting TOO upset . 
just realized < PROPFEMALE > Griffin was in \The Real Slim Shady\ " music video . " 
says < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > y < PROPFIRST > ity < PROPFIRST > . That was lame xD 
“You better be using protection . Accidents happen , how do you think you \ 
got here ? ” 
Mom : So < PROPFEMALE > one of the women I play cards with has a gay son as well . \ 
Would you like us to hook you up ? \ 
Me : What ! I’m not gay ! \ 
Dad : Then\ 
why are you in nursing school ? \ 
\ 
The things people say to their kids xD \

The Game . I lost it . 
likes that her mother just messaged her on facebook to get her a Nutty < PROPMALE > . What's happening to the world ? 
\ ... why is there a < PROPFEMALE > on my hand ? \ " - Me\ 
Would someone like to explain to me how < PROPFIRST > is a nickname for < PROPFIRST > ...? D: 
Two camels in a < PROPFEMALE > car ! D:< 
Alexity Ani made me lose the game . 
I'm starting to believe that I'm going to be killed by a cat one day D: just the other day I sat petting Tiger and saying how shed never bitten me , and what does she do ? Bite me . I think it was to spite me ... \ 
They're plotting against me I tell you . Is it because I stole their name Kat ? 
hates the fact that the power company can't seem to keep the power on . Even with epic snow storms in Minot , our electricity never went out as much as it does here ... and it goes off for no reason , WE'RE NOT IN AN EPIC STORM D:< STICK THAT IN YOUR JUICE BOX AND SUCK IT POWER COMPANY 
So I love how I think Facebook is fucking with my messages ... and how I'm realizing how absolutly awful it feels to worry so much when you don't know what's going on . I'm in pretty deep with this one . 
I felt so much better ... UNTIL YOU MADE ME LOSE THE GAME . THANK YOU < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > STOKES . xD Just kidding , I love you ... <3 
Well it's good to know I was wrong ... but it's not fun feeling stupid either . I'd take feeling a bit stupid over dealing with my spastic behavior anyday though . But apparently , I'd forgotten what it felt like to feel that strongly about something ... well damn . 
Sweet mother of llamapackinsign ! My pants tripped me up the stairs again , and I ended up falling into the railing . My right arm is getting abused by these pants . \ 
Mother has declared she will cut them down to size . Damn things ... I hope you like your new life as a pair of shorts . 
It's funny how \it doesn't like us :\\ . mostly you . \ " can actually make you laugh and feel better . :) " 
Just realized she has 16 days left until school . There goes the mood again . :\\ 
Well I feel better . Talking to a notepad is obviously easier than to a person though ... 
\In that one episode 
\What's your name ? \ " - Amy\ 
The last few nights I've walked into the living room to find our cats sat curiously across from each other on the floor . And the other night , when I walked back in minutes later , they had dispersed ... I have a suspicion that they are plotting , and as I peer at Tiger , whom has positioned herself in a box next to the box that contains our swords , I wonder if I should be worried ... hrmm ... 
Sweet mother of llamapackinsign ! \ 
Tiger just came in here and just attacked that box ! For no reason ! Holy cow , cats have some weird ' attack ' moments when they do outrageous things out of no where ! I don't like the way she's flickering her tail at me ... stick to attacking that box cat ! \ 
She keeps looking at me , I fear she knows I'm typing about her ... \ 
DOOM . 
Really Facebook chat ? Really ? Or Mozilla . Whichever of the two it is . But REALLY ? Are you aiming for making this day worse ? Or is it just a chanced oppurtunity you well , happened upon ? You'll be lucky I don't bitch slap your ass to < PROPFEMALE > D:< YOU ... SON OF A LLAMA BREEDER . \ 
Actually ... if you're the son of a llama breeder , I'm jealous , perhaps I can see your llama's one day . IF I DON'T HAPPEN TO BANISH YOU TO < PROPFEMALE > . 
Spider ! I warned you , if you come into my house and I see you , I will ... get my brother to kill you . Yeah . I went there . You could have lived a long happy life , but you decided to creep across my wall and scare the shit out of me ! Congratulations . 
Ugh . This time next week , I'll be on my second day of school . Well actually ... hopefully I'll be bloody well sleeping right now . Hot damn . This is gonna suck . 
D: I lost the game . 
\Giles and orgy in the same sentence 
Well crap . The realization that I only have one more day before school starts , just hit . I don't understand why our school has to be the only school in this country , to give us our schedules on the day of . It'd be nice to know ahead of time you know ... I love my school ... 
Fail ! Not only do I have homework on the very first day of school but I managed to be way cool , and pour my strawberry milk down my front . Apparently I'm out of practice with opening milk cartons , which they just reverted back to . At least I didn't trip ... xD yet . Overall it actually was alright . 
Holy llama fur . This week was going so majorally slow until I noticed ... IT'S FRIDAY TOMORROW ! Thank the Lord ! It went by so slowly , I guess I thought it would never end ! No wonder it's so surprising . 
The weekend ! ... And I have homework . And a fundraiser to do . Ugh ... 
\Do\ 
Well . I'm really inspired to do a < PROPFEMALE > x Twilight crossover now . All I can invision is Spike calling < PROPFIRST > a < PROPFEMALE > , and then kicking his ass , and < PROPFEMALE > straight up kicking < PROPFEMALE > in the face and her running off to < PROPFIRST > . That sounds like the greatest crossover I've ever heard of ... \ 
I like Twilight and all , but there are certain things that are just laughable about it . All shall be played upon :D 
Is jamming to music while doing homework :D there's nothing like singing extremely loud while dancing around like an idiot . Obviously my homework has been delayed a bit ... 
Shut the duck up ! I just lost the game . :( 
:( Well I'm missing some people , and it's making me really depressed . School has sucked this week because one of my best friends isn't there ... Dear week , please get better . I MISS YOU PEOPLE . That means you Kiki Pewitt and < PROPFIRST > Sheets . Yes , I went there . And I love you < PROPFEMALE > Stokes xD just so you don't feel left out , since I've talked to you . 
hates her pre-cal homework with a fiery passion :) 
Pick up line : \Are you a pink eraser ? Because I'd like to make a mistake and rub you all over . \ " \ 
Alex : \do you wish your homework was asexual so it would do itself ? \ " \ 
NOOOOOO . FAIL . I ran out of requests for Pieces of Flair xP \ 
DAMNIT . And I was about to start AN EPIC WAR . \ 
Screw you limitations , screw you . 
\You and me baby ain't nothin ' but mammals so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel . \ " - Bad Touch by The Bloohound Gang\ 
UGH . I find ALL the fabulous flair's I REALLY want to send ... AFTER I've exceeded my limit . Screw you Pieces of Flair Dx Screw you and THE GAME . 
Just made cookies ! And they are awesome ....... -ly flat xD hahaha . I laughed ... very hard . I obviously have a future as a flat cookie maker ; at least they tasted good though . 
YES . YES . JUST YES . The flair boards loaded . Nothing else . Gosh . \ 
Now let's hope they don't < PROPFIRST > up ... AGAIN . 
Gah ! One minute I'm hot , the next I'm cold . Make up your mind body , get it together ! What a sucky week , I just want it to be done , then I can somewhat sanely deal with this awful makeup work . Ugh ... 
Grr , darn you Going the Distance facebook update . Screw you and your rated R-ness . Nudity , language , sexual content oh my ! It's not like 17 year olds haven't seen that before . Don't let me in the movie theater , that's fine , you know what I'll do ? Buy it on DVD and ... WATCH IT ALONE . I hope a llama noms on you cinema . I really do . 
really wishes her homework was asexual , and would do itself . Find your own minima , mixima , increasing , and decreasing information graph ! 
Watching 9/11 videos is so heart wrenching ... I honestly think that's the first time I've really stood and watched it . They have a continuous video on TV , that put together multiple videos to show different views and different times . It's awful , but you just can't stop watching , staring . At this point , I feel like it just happened , I just can't believe it . So this is how everyone felt ? Man , it sucks to feel that pain . 
Facebook chat . I WON'T tell you again . Stop this nonsense , I'm aware < PROPFIRST > is made of pure awesomeness , and you're obviously jealous of her sudden unavliability , but GET OVER IT . You need to move on . You have to stop TALKBLOCKING OUR CHATS . Proceed and I shall sick my nomming llama on you , and then bitch slap you to Peru . 
\Remain calm 
It seems that I have four emails involving the offer of meeting sexy Asian singles for friendship or dating . Four . In a row . I think they want my business . 
Could anyone tell me what the Homecomig day themes are ? \ 
Monday's is the Super Blooper isn't it ? 
... I'm wondering , do flies believe in hell ? Because it's pretty useless to tell something to go to hell if it doesn't believe in it . \ 
But I think it understands THE LIGHT D:< !!! 
Hmm ... I'm not sure if I have a headache from my epic rocking out while doing homework , or the bloody homework itself and lack of actually finishing it ... I'll never know . Darn homework and awesome music D: 
Haha :) I can hear my mother celebrating in the next room about getting < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > TICKETS . And I get to go as well ! This is gonna be pretty sweet . 
Wishes she wasn't stuck doing a bunch of Pre-calculus homework right now ... 
The only bad thing about getting attached to someone is missing them . Or losing them in which case you more than likely would miss them . I hate this missing people thing , with a dirty stinkin ' passion . But I guess I'm glad I have people I care enough about to miss . It proves that I'm human at least . Of course it's always a debate ... do they miss me as well ? 
Well , I just lost the game ._. \ 
And now I'm wondering how people would have felt if I had used \The Game\ " as my senior quote ...? " 
A conversation between Gabby and myself . \ 
Gabbykinz says :\ 
XD -dies- i love you so freaking much\ 
Katty says :\ 
:D I love you too ! ... but don't die please . Or I'll ... or I'll ... I'll CRY . D: BIG . WET . TEARS . \ 
XD -dies- \ 
What went through your mind when you saw big and wet ? Gosh . I bet you thought dirty thoughts . \ 
Yes ... yes i did . XD\ 
I love my friends :) 
Is writing fanfiction . \ 
Because she's just that cool . \ 
And has no one to talk to . Haha . 
\Hey kids . This is your uncle < PROPFIRST > with an important message ; don't buy drugs .... become a rockstar and they give them to you for free ! \ " \ 
\Hook\ 
\We're pulling apart and coming\ 
wishes she had the motivation to do her homework ..... or anything useful really . :/ 
Best part of my day ? \ 
Being stuck in the crowded hallway and exclaiming \We're not going fast enough ! \ " and then hearing \ " Thats what she said . \ " from in front of me . :) haha ... " 
Snow snow snow :D !!! 
is currently watching season one of Doctor Who with the ninth Doctor and < PROPFEMALE > . This episode is , ironically , placed in 2012 . Let's see what happens , shall we ? 
So I haven't posted anything in forever , and the last thing I posted about was Doctor Who , therefore I believe it is only appropriate that . I . Want . A . Sonic . Screwdriver . Pen . :)
