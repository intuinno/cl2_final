SEE ?! I DID IT SO THERE ! xP 

So , it seems to me that I have to write something new in here every five minutes ...? 
Uh oh . It's been EIGHT minutes . 
' Slither ' is a great , cheesy horror flick ! 
\Where does dust come from ? \ " \ " Trees . \ " \ " We got no trees ! \"" 
Have I mentioned that I have an obsession with surveys ? >_____> 
I stayed home today . I almost fell down , three times , going from my mom's room to my room . : x 
I just messaged a few childhood friends . I hope all goes well ! > w < 
I can proudly say that I didn't have to deal with any high school drama bullshit this year ! AND I PLAN TO KEEP IT THAT WAY D;< 
Mmmm ... I'm gonna go to bed , like now . Which will probably translate into ten minutes from now , but whatevs . 
* cough * Thirty-two minutes later ... and I'm logging off and going to bed . Goodnight , friends ! Sleep well ~ ! <3 
Oh boy ... another day at high school ... D; 
Owwies ~ ! I got cat scratched ! >____< 
I <3 sleep . Come back to me ~~~ ! D; 
Sometimes it's hard to realize you can't please everybody . 
Don't look ... don't look ... don'tlookdon'tlookdon'tlook-- AH , DAMNIT I LOOKED ! QUICK , LOOK AWAY BEFORE HE SEES ! 
\Rawr means ' I love you ' in dinosaur . \"" 
So , if anyone knows of a website with fun surveys , send it my way . xD 
Seaweed is BEAST . Oh and I have rock-awesome dad . 
Suuurrre , < PROPFIRST > . Sure . ;P 
This ad on the right says I'm not alone . Therefor , I think there's someone hiding in my dad's closet . >_____< 
Being free , truly free , isn't about being able to do whatever you want , whenever you want . It's about making the right decisions without having someone to tell you to . 
Oh boy , I'm craving breakfast tacos ! xD 
I want to start a riot ... against homophobic bigots at my school . D;< 
The clock is ticking . It's a shame to want it to tick faster . 
Is it wrong to play with my cat's fat ? 
Here's to hoping tomorrow is successful . ^^ ;; 
Phew , that was a load off . : D 
Ohhh ... memory < PROPFIRST > . T T_______T T 
Defense games make me go \weeeee ~\"." 
It's so weird how people can do a 180 and NOT throw up . Just sayin ' . 
My air isn't your trash can . xP 
I hate waking up with a headache . D; 
Digimon , Digital Monsters , Digimon are the CHAMPIONS ! 
Reminder : Make those BRACELETS that you've been needing to work on for the past three months . : l 
\Mystery Google\ " turned into \ " Mystery Missions\ " ... and you have to get account . That's eff'd up . : l " 
So , uh ... if I have another nightmare , I'm promptly going to transform a friend of mine into a monk/healer/alchemist/psychic/what-have-you and fix it . ' Cause damn I'M TIRED ! D; 
Have you ever had the urge to BEAT THE SHIT out of a child ? : l I mean , I wasn't around the kid and I don't have the balls or gaul to do it anyway , but I mean ... DAMN . 
Mmmm ... nothing like a long night's rest to soothe the nerves . <3 
Operation NO REGRETS will now commence ! Wish me goodluck ! > w < 
I tried several times to write something here , but my mind's whirlwind . 
It'd be so nice to take a nap right now ... 
So , I had a blast today . I haven't laughed so hard in a long time and I got to feel warm fuzzies . However , these fuzzies were not dead , long-haired gray cats kept maintained by the freezing cold . : D 
I don't believe in having serious , personal conversations where everyone can see , on a networking site . Not only is it embarrassing , it's disrespectful . 
Oh em gee . So , my aunt , who only knows the side of me who is shy , slightly random , and loves anime , has a Facebook . If she even got a GLIMPSE at my profile , she might freak . xD 
W-wow ... I'm kind of speechless . : nervous chuckle : 
So , I'm trying to do a little clean-up . Hopefully the kitties don't mess it all up . : x 
Those times when you're so content you can hardly concentrate on what somebody's saying ... priceless . 
I hate nights where I'm too anxious to sleep . : X 
I thank the stars for those moments of relaxation and contentment and the people who help me get there . 
Wow , I haven't died yet ! Here's to hoping the curse is broken ~ <3 
Decisions , decisions ... 
Man ... I feel like I'm going to drop dead ( asleep ) any second now ... too bad caffeine SUCKS too much or I'd use that to get me energized . Haha , oh the irony ... 
Oh jeez , it might be the end of the world . I'll be looking for a dress tomorrow . : l Consensually . As in , my idea . o_______o 
OH MAN ! I partied hard and DIDN'T HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD ! Who knew getting dirty could make me feel so alive ?! xD 
Getting ready for my Graduation outing with < PROPFIRST > . It'll be a nice , elegant night , I think . 
We've been through Hell and back and now look at us . We're standing strong despite all the shit that came our way . Our 14-year-old selves would be proud . : ) 
All I have left is Tuesday . Tuesday I will have my diploma and will , officially , have graduated high school . Wowzers . 
LOL @People who get super involved/excited and make weird noises while watching a movie 
Mannnnn ~ I want some food . xD 
I can't wait to start making some munnies . >____> 
Dude ! Why does < PROPFIRST > Pride have to be this Saturday ?! And here I was thinking I was actually going to be able to GO this year !!! D; 
Nyanya ~ a nice , restful Summer day . : swoons :\ 
\ 
I hope things get exciting soon ! xD 
I wish my phone had \hold\ " music ! That would be so totally awesome ! " 
Ok , phone , I get it . YOU'RE A JERK !!! D;< 
Oooo ... scary noises from the sky ! I wish I had someone to cuddle up with . >_______> 
Ok , what is the world coming to when a teen stabs his mom over a CHEESEBURGER ? Seriously . I don't know if I should laugh or be enraged . 
Lets get down and dirty !!! 
What are you fonduing tonight ? ; P 
This is so surreal . Is all this even happening ? o________0 
Pride came and went . Another year . T T________T T \ 
It's ok , though . Next year , I will have this shit on lock . o________o 
If you like this , I will not only say something I like about you , but also one thng I don't like about you , as well as one , if it exists , thing I thought about you but didn't have the balls to tell you . \ 
Stolen from < PROPFIRST > . : D 
So , within the past 72 hours , I've managed to burn the same finger TWICE . To make up for the damage , I'm wearing a Hello < PROPFEMALE > band-aid . :) \ 
Also , I hope all goes well during my interview today . 
I had fun , yes . Yes , yes , yes , I did . :) 
Why is it such a big deal right now ? o_______0 
So , I feel significantly better . :) 
The tell-tale signs it's Summer :\ 
1 . I'm job hunting . \ 
2 . I go out in the afternoon to get the mail and the light BLINDS me . \ 
3 . I get addicted to Gaia . Addicted ... to ... Gaia ... \ 
Looks like I have to go work on number 3 . xD 
I just like to roll ~ \ 
<3 Katamari ! 
Mmmm ... it's raining . I wish I could just run around in it and get soaking wet with somebody . : D 
So I found out last night that I do an amazing impression of a neurotic pig . : D 
I'm a seed eater ! : D 
I'm totally looking forward to the next bout of craziness this Summer . : ) Just sayin ' . 
Adventurrrrrrrre ~~~~ : D 
I hate it when someone cooks something that smells like \sweaty vagina\ " ... \ 
GUESS WHAT TIME IT IS ?!?!?!!?!?!? \ 
IT'S TIME FOR AN < PROPMALE > HUNT !!! o______o 
I REALLY want some donuts ... really bad . xD DAMN THESE FACEBOOK ADS ! D;< 
Why does my cantaloupe taste like nail polish remover ? o_____0 
I feel so blessed to have such awesome friends of all different walks of life . Thank you guys , for making ( and continuing to make ) my life an adventure ! < 3 
San Japan is becoming more and more of an important event for me . Just saying . 
Ooo ~ here's a first for me . I'm so very excited ! : D 
Ffffff ~ why don't I have any deck making skills ? D; 
\I'm scared ... the pool is cold ... could I possibly get any smaller ? \"" 
I swear most ' em probably think I'm using a really bad pick-up line ... but I'm NOT . I promise ! D; 
Nnnff ... 
Siiigh . How bitter-sweet can this get ? 
LOL . \Scare me up a piece of ass\ " . That's cuuute . <3 " 
Why do people insist on scaring Skitty away , hmm ? >////> 
OMG ! Somebody I worship just said something to me about something other than business ! * nosebleed * I feel like a stereotypical peasant ... xD 
Sooo ... I just went running around my neighborhood and I'm coughing up a lung . xD Looks like I need more exercise ! ^^ ; 
That was ... the most interesting conversation I've ever had . * speechless * 
Being confused must really suck . So , uh ... if need be , feel free to ask for help . Sometimes it's the best thing to do . 
I don't know if that's good or bad , but at least it's something right ? 
Wh-wh-what TIME is it ?! \ 
It's get the FxCK up ! 
THERE'S HOPE FOR THE WORRRLD ~ ! \ 
<3 
Yo , Summer Time , you and me need to have a talk . In my office . \ 
You need to fuckin ' stop . 
Can I pretend today doesn't exist ? 
What was that ? I couldn't hear you . I was gettin ' my animu con on , biotch ! \ 
: rock < PROPFEMALE > pose : 
Ahhh ... I love my bed right now . 
It feels good to sleep in ! ^o^ 
I did , in fact , figure something out , just as you said . However , I haven't really listened to those fortune cookies ... 
Can't complain = I have no room/right to complain , so I WILL be happy with my life , damnit ! : determined face : 
So , this one time , me and my < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ... wait . \ 
I don't have a friend named < PROPFIRST > . Ah , mannnn ~ ! D; 
Again and again and again again . Do it again . Again and again . 
I hate it when my eye starts twitching . 
: rubs eyes : Why am I up ? 
What the Hell ? This feeling's below me . : l 
Nothing = story of my week . xD\ 
Change status , plox ? 
Chill OUT , dude , seriously . You were expecting this . \ 
Don't get all schoolgirl on me . ~ Nate 
Ok , so that was PATHETIC . Way to make a bad impression , dummy . ~ Nate 
I HATEHATEHATE my sensitive stomach . 
Hooray ! Nothing was wiped out on my computer AND it works again ! No < PROPFEMALE > spent either ~ ! < 3 
The world cried on both days , you know . It really did . 
Ew . So , apparently , there was a stabbing at Comic-con . 
AGAIN with being up so RIDICULOUSLY LATE . o______o 
I wish this would go fasterrrrr ~ xD

< PROPFIRST > Justice , thanks for sharing your adventures with me . I lived through you briefly . : D 
Ladies and gentleman , THAT is how you do it . \ 
I'm tellin ' ya ' , he's got his swag on . 
I may have pissed off a < PROPMALE > ghost . \ 
Good thing or bad thing ? 
5 hours of sleep with nothing but frightening images and being stirred awake by them 7 times . Ugh . D; 
Damnit , < PROPMALE > , get yo ' ass over hurr ~ ! 
: in Yeti voice : YOU WANNA SEE THE ANGRY BEAVER ?! 
I be Ms. Busy body over hurrr ~ 
Of course . It has to be like that . I mean , it wouldn't be Summer if it were any other way , now would it ? Fucking season . 
What are YOU doing ? \ 
Going to The Magic Time Machine with my mum n ' dad , aunt and cousin , and my gran'ma whom I haven't seen in ten years . Whoop whoop ~ ! 
Zio's bread is better than < PROPFEMALE > Garden's , < PROPFEMALE > EM OH . Just saying . : ) 
Your eyes were brighter then ... 
Akiko ~ <3 \ 
Thaaaat's me !

; D 
I'm gettin ' all kinds of caked up . < 3 
There's a coathanger in the closet . \ 
Did I effing stutter ? xD 
I feel like writing a list ... xD 
All this creativity ... with no idea where it will go . D; 
Surrrre , < PROPFIRST > . Surrrre ~ . \ 
\THAT'S A HUGE BITCH ~!\" <3 " 
I wanna do something . I really , really do . 
I hear very loud techno coming from outside . I hope it's for me . xP 
This ... right here ... is my ... pretty-boy-swag . \ 
Doughnuts don't wear alligator skin boots ! 
I see that you were up on that individual ... 
Firstly , < PROPMALE > Dodson confirmed that he is , indeed , gay . Woot ~ ! \ 
Secondly , now , APPARENTLY , we gots < PROPFEMALE>' hide our aunts . 
Must find motivation to continue story . \ 
Already inspired like a gummi worm on acid . 
What kind of person do you have to be to have a dream in which your wishes get crushed ? : l\ 
In other news -- I gotta get < PROPFEMALE>' party hat on ~ ! : D 
GET SOME ! DAMN , BIEBER-BEE , I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU ~ ! \ 
<3 Thanks for the good times/memories , you guys . : ) 
Watching Dragon Ball Z with my mom = priceless . : ) 
Keel awl sons a ' bitches . 
DUBBYA TEE EFF ?! Really ? \Achievement Unlocked\ " on Gaia ? " 
ACTUALLY \Gaia iz teh winz\ " is in the dictionary ! It means : see ' Troll ' . <3 " 
Really ? I didn't need to see/think about that . Now I'm going to go poke out my mind's eye and screw a Squirtle to regain my mental stability . 
Apparadently I need to kick MANY an ass . Golly gee whiz , what's up with the sudden outbreak of stupidity ? 
WAIT . WAIT . STOP . PAUSE . \ 
WHAT . IN . THE . MOTHER-OF-GOD HAPPENED ? 
Maybe is such a broad word ... but at least I know how to roll with it . : D 
My cats are running all over the house , making it sound like there's a storm brewing inside these walls . 
Ok , so those of you who are familiar with \Pretty Boy Swag\ " ... I DARE you to watch the music video for the first few seconds and tell me that he isn't wearing a BLUE TAIL . \ 
I'm so thankful that I've been given this opportunity to concentrate on having fun/being there for two of my best friends . \ 
You haven't brought me down in the slightest . <3 
Apple feces : the sweetest , grossest thing you could ever find . 
Cliffhangers : there are just some things you shouldn't do . : l 
Whatever you say , warden . : l 
CD making : it's my drug . <3 
' CUZ YOU'RE A HOT MESS AND I'M FALLIN ' FOR YOU AND I'M LIKE HOT DAMN I WANNA MAKE YOU MY BOO ' CUZ YOU CAN SHAKEITSHAKEITSHAKEIT ~~~ 
Hmmm ... what's that ? I'm sorry , I couldn't hear you . There are four very obnoxious kids in my IHop talking about blow jobs ! xP 
I hope all my friends still in high school had a good day today . 
Apparently I can't be serious/write when listening to Pretty Boy Swag . I gotta break out in dance . Damnit . >____> 
Striving to do a chapter of my book a day . I'm on chapter 3 and I have 30 chapters , in total , planned . Whoa , boy , I'm gonna need some motivation up in this brain right hurr ~ . 
.... Ugh , I feel sick . 
Seriously considering making a Facebook account as an anime character with a group of people , just for some good ol ' Tomfoolery . Characters will be anonymous and IN character . \ 
Question is , which anime and : are you in ? 
Well , HOT DAMN , I want 500 free condoms ... I mean , not to USE them . Just to say , \Dude 
\Homosexuality is more common than left-handed people . You have nothing to fear ! \ " \ 
Open the door ~ get on the floor ~ \ 
Everybody walk the BULBASAUR ~ ! 
Ahhhh ... it seems I'll actually be going to bed earlier than 5AM today . Sweet . :D 
I dreamt about conformities last night . Everyone I knew was smoking , drinking , breaking rules , and talking about Wow , except me . My thought during the entire thing was , \what the FUCK is going ON ? \"" 
Apparently there's a video of an old lady throwing a cat in a trash can on the internet and she's now called , \the villain of the web\ " . I refusae to watch the video 
Ohhhh , 4chan . How you make lol inside . <3 
When I get up it's story writing and filling out applications for me . : D 
I feel like Garybombing someone on Facebook . : / 
I was < PROPMALE > away from the edge until THAT EFFING DREAM . Now , I swear , all I need is a few more light taps . 
Ok . It's time for a break . 
Being \mad niggerish\ " is one of the few things protecting my sanity/keeping me from the edge . I cling on to it like an ex-cigarette smoker clings to his nicotine patches . : l " 
Wow ... I've got nothin ' but Pokemon on the brain . 
Ohhhhh Morty . Sweet , ghost pokemon gym leader Morty . Do want . <3 
What the Hell . Arguments shouldn't be held at 4 in the morning . I don't care WHO you are . \ 
Shut . the . fxck . up . 
I'm amused that some people are JUST NOW hopping on the < PROPMALE > Dodson bandwagon ... <3 
Someone is blasting their < PROPFIRST > Lambert CD outside of my house ... and I approve . <3 
Oh goodie , more excuses to talk about manlove ! ^o^\ 
Oh goodness ... Morty ( Pokemon in general ) , < PROPMALE > Poppycock , inspiration , and whole BUTTLOAD of roleplay . That's what I gots right now . <3 
That was a nice little twist . : ) 
Today is full of surprises ! 
REMINDER : make an AIM called AkikoxKee . \ 
I needs to do it . ^o^ 
I want items named Goddamnit and Sunkist . Just saying . 
My mom says my hands are like icicle hands ! D; \ 
Nobody wants icicle hands ! ;^; 
Time for a teef cleaning ~ \ 
;^; 
I HATE knowing the date and time of when I will be in mortal agony , but at least I have time to prepare . \ 
: doom and glooms : 
I absolutely love going off on random , nonsensical stories with people who can play along . <3 
LOL , so I just troll'd someone for the first time on 4chan . It was beautiful . : ) 
I want a bracelet that says , \W . W . G . S . \ " ( What Would < PROPMALE > Say ) so I can look at it when talking to anime/manga fans who download . " 
I'm tired of all these ads telling me to make a baby . Damnit , I don't even KNOW you ! 
I hate how one little thing makes me self-conscious . 
likes being weird . : ) 
I'm really trying to fight off violent urges against BOYS who are mistreating beautiful , intelligent women . It's like all at once they decided to rear their ugly heads and SHIT on my friends ' lives and that is NOT acceptable . 
Despite what I tell myself ... I still find that I smile looking back on the past . 
What do you do when kindness and tough love don't work ? : l 
Hey cosplayers ! I was thinking about dressing my friend up as Morty and me as his Gengar . Any ideas how I can make a Gengar costume ? 
Why can't I have a NORMAL conversation ? xD Maybe I like it that way . 
Mannnn this is ridiculous . By the time I get out of there it'll be at least 12+ hours since I've eaten , I'll be starving as Hell , but tired and loopy all at the same time . \ 
I just want me some good ol ' < PROPMALE > n ' cheese . > : l 
I'm not gonna let some OP tell ME what to do . I got this . 
Mm ... finally conscious enough to get on the computer . Pills still make it hard to think , but at least I'm not dead . xD 
Send me videos/images to make me smile , please . : ) 
I want cuddles andor company ~ 
Aw ... that was nice AND unexpected . Who knew good things could come out of being in pain ? 
Vertigo on acid ... sounds like a band name . xD 
It's odd ... even on several mind altering medications , I still talk about the things I normally would on any other day/time . I guess that just shows that I'm honest about who I am and the way I act . : )\ 
Or it's nearly impossible to control me and bend me . xDDD 
Mmmm ... thanks for the butterflies . <3 
Hmmm ... well , Shota Day's almost over and I've yet to do anything to celebrate . What to do , what to do ... 
Ah ! Bombarded again ~ ! o____0 
To all my friends who have classes tomorrow ... I'm cheering you on and wishing you well . : )\ 
Here's to pleasant dreams and success ! <3 
Woke up feeling like a storm from Hell hit me upside my face . Pretty sure I look it too . 
Anyone know someone could translate one song from japanese to english ? Normally I wouldn't ask such a thing , but I've loved this song for five years and it STILL doesn't have an ( un)official english translation . : / 
Wow , Mr. Lightning Bolt , way to kill the mood . : l 
On another note ... fXCKING HELL THIS HURTS LIKE A BITCH ! IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE JACK-JAMMERED MY TEETH !!! D;< 
Just a heads up to anyone who talks to me tonight : I had to take extra medicine for the severe amount of pain I was in and I've given up on caring how I type/exactly what I say . \ 
Feel free to make fun of me . : ) 
For the record , last night , my meds and mouth had my body and mind kicked , beat , shredded , and disguarded like an old gum wrapper . I'm doing better today , though . : )\ 
Thanks to those who were there for me ~ <3 
Dear boys , \ 
If you like someone , tell them . They're cute , funny , give you the butterflies , and an all around great girl ( boy ? ) . Why miss the opportunity to set their world on passionate fire ? They're worth it , so don't be scared . \ 
Love , \

Dear God , not THIS again ! So HELP ME , SHIRLENA , I WILL SHOW YOU NO MERCY ! 
B'awww~ I was reminded of my undying love of kitties ! > w < 
Just got done watching a Pokemon movie with the ' rents . What better way to enjoy a night ? : ) 
Mmmmhm . Life is good . 
Life is too short and beautiful to be so tense . \ 
Just roll with and try to keep your head up . It'll be worth it in the end . \ 
Plus EVERYBODY appreciates a smile much more than a frown . <3 
I use ' Q's as exclamations marksQQQ 
Goodnight , Facebook ~ ! Sweet dreams . <3 
Today's a day for hugs , not thugs . <3 
had a frightening dream and is freaked out . MOTHER FUCKER . I am SO thankful that my dreams portray my friends realistically and I also have a tendency of being saved . 
What's it mean when I dream that I get tricked into working at a spooky house with a cannibal livingin it and get sent into slave trade by a guy who hates me , but I was trying to impress , and then try to run away and my friends die ? But I predict all this in a vision on the bus and I avoid it by cutting off connections I would have made in the future by running away once I got to the house ? \ 
Dear Arceus ! D; 
People need to learn how to be happy with THEMSELVES first before letting anything else make them happy . Of course , the opposite geberally happens and once that thing that makes them happy is gone , they're lost . 
On a lighter note : mmmm ... I want food . : 3 
Also , parents aren't home . There's only one thing to do . \ 
BLAST THAT SHIT ! \

When I derp , I derp hard . : ) 
AHCHOOSE YOU . <3 
Happy birthday , 4chan ! ^o^ 
Just because you're in a bad mood does not mean you can stomp around and take it out on the innocent . 
Oooooo ~ frieeeeend ! 
I'm sorry that you feel that foul language and an increase of volume will get your point across . Let me save you the embarrassment and tell you that your tactics don't work . 
I just want you all to know that I love you . All of you . In different ways , yes , but you ARE special . KNOW that you have someone to talk to . 
Don't do that EVER AGAIN . 
oh God ... everything hurts . ;^; 
I like it wherever is the most convenient .

Mmmmmhm . Wondering why I didn't start walking every day sooner . It's done wonders for me . 
When you read this type : \banana\ " in the comment box . \

I decided to go march in March so you can march in March while I march in March . 
Yes , yes . Take your time . I certainly took mine so it's only fair , right ? I'll be waiting . : ) 
Canada was so five weeks ago ... 
Vulnerable . Cuddly . Meow .

In other news , I'm adoring this weather . : ) 
Just did a Christmas Shop and Drop . Feels good man . : 3 
Oh and I'm ready for a goddamn rave . : )

Missing some close friends right now . Still cuddly . Still creative . 
Underwhelmed . o.o 
That's it . There's only one waffle on that plate that I want and I'm too stubborn to settle .

Thanks for bringing me a candle as the sun sets . I've no idea when it will rise again , but this light is enough to allow me to go on . 
Stop with the negativity , the awkwardness , the inconsideracy , the cynicism , the suspicion , the pressure , and the disrespect . Please . I understand that some situations in life are unbearable and that's fine . I'm here for you , those of you who need me . But there's just so much of this other crap that it's almost ridiculous . 
The excitement's slowly coming to me ... it's starting in my hands and my voice ... 
Ikkicon V was pretty damn good . It wasn't as great as last year , there was some drama and complications , and I did miss a few people , but ... I met some new friends , had a good time , danced like I've never danced before , took a bunch of pictures and video , and had Vietnamese food for the first time . So yeah , I'd say not only was this a great weekend , but also a pretty good start to a New Year . : ) 
If that's a wink-y face , so help me God ... 
New year equals a new me . A'ight , let's do this . 
BALLZ TO YOU ! 
S'up guys ? I'm a palm tree . 
Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are . Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST name . It can only be 1 word . Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Don't just post a word & not copy .

HEY . YOU THERE . I see you over there ... 
I don't know who the fuck you are anymore . > : l

W-well then ... can't beat that with a stick , now can I ? 
Fuck you . 
Ok , finally feeling better . Killing myself with kindness . 
I'm only gonna Brick Break your heart ~ 
Please put this on your status if you know or LOVE someone who is gay ... My wish for 2011 is that people will understand that being gay is not a DISEASE nor a CHOICE-people who are gay are not looking for a CURE but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS !! 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ...? 
Imperfection is underrated .
