seriously considered killing the huuuuugest spider she's ever seen with a shampoo bottle last night , but decided against it once she realized that hearing it crunch would prevent her from sleeping . 
Dear Aldi Customers , If a woman on a bicycle is attempting to sell her foodstamps for gas money & you give her $40 ... you may have just funded a crack whore .

will be glued to the TV watching the season premier of The Tudors for the next two hours . 
doesn't get high off just being her . She likes pretending . 
is sick of working on beautiful days and being off in the rain . But her Bender weather says Wednesday could very well be decent . Yay ! 
is pretty sure she's watched way too many History Channel specials and read way too many books on urban warfare , because everytime she drives/walks past empty chip bags or random stuffed animals on the side of the road .... well .... her first reaction is OH MY GOD IED TURN AROUND !!! ... That's just terrible . 
thinks if she had a dollar for everytime she heard that ... well ... she'd have at least $5 from him and $1 from you . 
will be doing some phonetics work today , possibly taking a walk downtown , and doing some overall villian chillin ' before getting up at 04:00 for work tomorrow .

had a man come through her line today wearing 3 different types of camo ; jungle camo , digital camo , and hunting camo . Needless to say ................... she couldn't see him . 
will FINALLY be doing some Spring Cleaning . All day . Because it's come to her attention that the dust bunnies next to her T.V. have been begging for names for quite a few weeks now . 
is driving out to the lake with a book to get some sun . 0400 truck-throwing is gonna suck tomorrow . 
likes to make herself believe that Planet Earth turns slowly . 
found No Vacancy to be randomly hilarious and completely entertaining in a Baz [ specifically Strictly Ballroom ] meets Go kind of way . It will definitely be in her next amazon.com order ! She also thinks < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > might enjoy it , as long as they keep the Baz part in mind :o )

Dude , best date EVER :o ) And congrats to all my compers ! In other news : nap , work , bed , back up at 04:00 to throw a truck , nap , and FINAL TRIP TO < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Sit Rep : The guy at Applebee's wasn't dead . He was drunk . The 5 POs failed to notice the man when they towed his abandoned truck & he was passed out less than 100 ' away . They arrested him hours later for disorderly conduct after many concerned citizens called 911 . Question : How does a man get charged with disorderly conduct when he appeared to be DEAD in the grass behind Applebee's all freakin ' night ? 
is glad she drove back from < PROPFEMALE > when she did , because now she's stuck opening tomorrow :-/ 
is going to work , then to bed , then waking up at 06:00 for Divorce Court . Literally . Never been so nervous and so excited , except maybe when she was taking comps . Yeah , she just compared the two . Anyway , she's hoping that since she got out of the hospital alive , she can get out of this marriage . Alive . She thinks that'd be really nice . Yep .

is not gonna lie ; She's pretty freakin ' happy right about now . On the downside , another cat has been acquired . PFC Ghee Buttersnaps . If he masters the litterbox she might promote him to SPC .

A $3 million yacht just docked outside the hotel . Word on the street is < PROPFIRST > Buffet's in town . The street is only 14 < PROPMALE > long , so the word is probably accurate . Oh , and < PROPMALE > Bloom was here Sunday . 
Last day on the Island .... what to do what to do ....

Truck throwing and early morning meetings until Thursday . So , I will have my phone on silent or just blatantly ignore it until then :-p

And of course , the parked car just had to belong to HER BEST FRIEND ! [ Geez < PROPFEMALE > ] Much to the amusement and disbelief of the various mechanics visited for estimates , they're still friends :o ) 
wonders , What's your favorite dish ? She's not gonna cook it but she'll order it from ZANZIBAR !

' s rental is so nice she's having second thoughts about sneaking a smoke or two . 
got a full Tarot Reading today & it was pretty much spot on ... except for the part about being married in a year & a half and having two kids . 
Looks like the rental will be sticking around a bit longer . And uber-retarded day at work . May be dragging the TV into the next room for a bubble bath . Now that's what you would call lazy . 
Omg FOOD ! * om nom nom nom nom * Omg BED ! * FLOP * ZZZzzzzz .... 
Dear Christmas , We agreed there would be no raping of the bank account this year . I'm writing to inform you that your behavior has been considered a breech of contract . If you do not cease and desist , further action will be taken . Love , < PROPFEMALE > .

would really like to change her name on her driver's license now . 
Car looks pretty again :o ) And got an extra $200 out of it ... YAY ! 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > College , \ 
How do I put this mildly ... I paid $ 25,000 a year for a high school level education and your job placement is non-existent so STOP SENDING ME EFFING LETTERS ASKING ME FOR $$ DONATIONS BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN . \ 
Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Walmart has Call of Duty boxers ... yeah ... and guess what ? ... I'm a dork . 
Still picking sugar out of my hair . Freakin Aldis . 
Too poor to send out < PROPMALE > Collins christmas cards this year [ I know , you are all incredibly disappointed . And I don't blame you . ] So here's to a cliched FB Status instead : < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone <3 
Just finished New < PROPFEMALE > & Eclipse and can I just say ... That's gotta be the most fucked up , dysfunctional and abusive relationship I've ever seen Hollywood attempt to glorify . 
Mmmm Christmas Cash , how I love thee . Pop Quiz Time : What is conveniently located across the parking lot from work ...? 
So it stands to reason that one of my regular customers would work there . THAT was sliiiightly awkward . 
YAY inventory . [ Negative Boo Hiss . ] 
I grab a moment like a thief and then I make it mine . 
Finally got the essay , resume , and headshot sent out to the Esper Studio :o ) 
Not ready for the pain that will be my ears today ... 
I love how the pilots flying in & out of the Air Base use our farm as a landmark . [ note : zero sarcasm . I really do love it . ] 
So glad that was an easy truck . I think I need a nap . 
Was slightly concerned about getting mail from Iraq , but that was the best Christmas card I've gotten in awhile . I feel like I just got smacked upside the head with a giant 2x4 on which REALITY is spray-painted in neon green ... in a good way . Keni < PROPFIRST > , never stop leading the way . 
I'm really going to need a nap ... 
Dying a slow & painful death until Friday . 
Ok , 1 ) I can smell your roach 2 ) It is not only the 1st of the month , it is the 1st of the year . Please be sure to take your annual shower before shopping 3 ) You're like 85 so No , I don't need a boyfriend and 4 ) Tomorrow is gonna suck . Back up at 05:30 to throw a truck . 
So I decided to impale my leg on a < PROPFEMALE > because not being able to feel my toes sounded like a good idea . 
8-6 tomorrow , then partyin it up in Y-town for < PROPFIRST>'s 30th & possibly crashin in the worth of Els . 
My niece can't say ' Meggie . ' So I've become ' Aunt Money , ' which seems fitting since I'm always stuck at work . 
Listening to some Phil :o )

I have nothing I need to do today . Which would normally rock , except it hasn't happened in awhile & I'm not used to it . So I'm probably just gonna end up feeling more worthless and blah than I already do . ( click ' comment ' & insert expletive of choice in box below )

A < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > movie will be filming in < PROPMALE > this spring . Casting calls are this weekend . I have a wedding in the spring and can't afford more time off work as I need $ for NY . My question is : should I go anyway for the experience , or do crews generally frown upon actors who use up their time but are not serious about getting the job ? 
Dear Facebook , \ 
What's with all the Horoscopes all of a sudden ? Also , will you please tell Megabus.com to get its act together . I would love to be able to get to New York for $1 . Thanks . \ 
Love , < PROPFEMALE > 
Dear Rumor Mill , \ 
You win . Rather than wait until I got everything worked out , I felt I was forced to put in my notice today . You better damn well hope I find someplace to live in NY , or I'm going to be one angry bitch without a job . Oh , and thanks for reminding me why I will not miss Ohio . \ 
Fuck You , \
