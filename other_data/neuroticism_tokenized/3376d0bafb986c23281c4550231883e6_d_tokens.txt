Is wonderin why I continue to work in customer service when I hate the public in general . People are so mean ! :-( 
Is on the way to the courthouse to begin jury duty today . So not excited ! LOL 
day 1 of jury duty over , and I'm already on a criminal trial for the next 2 days ... at least . I'm sure my co-workers are not to happy about being more short-handed than usual , but I'm glad to get a break from the madness :) 
Screw you Syfy for cancelling Caprica and then not airing the final 5 episodes until tonight , and screw you comcast for not listing the episodes as new in the giude so my dvr didn't record them . You bastards ! 
Day 3 of trial to begin soon . I must say that jury duty can be an inconveniece , but watching our justcie system in action is kind of interesting . MUCH different than on tv ! 
Finally heard from the courthouse bailiff on the case I was sitting on . < PROPFIRST > Mellerio was found quilty on all 12 counts , including kidnapping , robbery , coerscion , menacing , theft , and assault . I hope the $20 he was owed by the 14 y/o victim was worth the time he will spend in prison . It's sad what meth addiction does to people . 
Don't get me wrong ... I miss < PROPMALE > when he's gone . But I have slept SOOOO good the last couple nights with the big ' ol < PROPMALE > sized bed to myself ! :) 
was craving Chinese food , so I went to get take-out for lunch . They gave me more food with one combination meal than I usually get for BOTH me and < PROPMALE > . I gonna be eating this for the next two day ! :-S 
Is done with the negativity and friend bashing that's been going around on here . Round one of Facebook friend cuts tonight when I get hoome ! 
Anybody that knows anything about the law of gravity knows that if two people are tugging on something , one bitch is gonna fall . - < PROPFEMALE > , \You're Cut Off\ " \ 
My 3 y/o nephew Wyatt : \Are you leaving uncle Jason ? \ " \ 
Got selected for another jury trial . Boss is not happy , but nothing I can do . Sorry to my fellow technicians . Hope your week doesn't suck too bad ! 
Second trial over . Jury duty DONE ! Not excited about going back to work , but at least today is my Friday so I don't have to be there until Sunday . :-) 
Dear un-named co-worker , \ 
If you're trying to drive me crazy , I don't need a ride . I can walk from here . \ 
Thanks , \ 
< PROPFIRST > 
Go Celtics ! What ? That's not football ? Oh well . I really didn't care anyway . ;-) \ 
For those of you that like that kind of crap , I hope you're enjoying the game ! :-D 
Today sucks . Can't wait till it's over ! Seems like everyone in town is sick and wants their prescription NOW ! 
LOVING my new Motorola Cliq 2 ! RIP T-Mobile G1 . You were good to me for 2 years , but your lack of memory was your downfall . :-) 
I really can't wait for < PROPFEMALE > to come around and kick your a$$ ! 
Finally a day off tomorrow , them back to work for 4 days before another . I really hate this split days off crap ! 
< PROPMALE > has gotten me addicted to the show Damages . If you haven't seen it , I highly recommend it . You can stream seasons 1 & 2 on netflix and season 3 is available on dvd . 
So exhausted ! Bad case of insomnia last night . Maybe 1 hour of bad sleep . Now for 8 hours of work . Hopefully I'll make it through the day with out fallinf asleep on my feet . :-/ 
Looking forward to < PROPFEMALE > Lampanelli's new special on Comedy Central tonight . I love that b ! tch ! :)
