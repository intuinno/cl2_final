Had some dental surgery done this morning . I'm feeling better now . I have three more to go through next month . 

I've been thinking of buying about 100 or so acres in Eastern Washington for some time now . After doing some mulling , I'd like to have at least a quarter section of land for some privacy and to raise cattle for some off grid ways of providing energy to run the farm/ranch . A shooting range would be nice too . I'm thinking of somewheres north of Spokane . 
Earlier today , I came home from the VA hosptial . As I backed my truck into the space I usually park under the trees in front of my house , I got to listening to the rain hitting my truck . It's been years since I've been able to take the time to listen to my surroundings . Just as I was getting into the sound of the raindrops on my windows , my younger daughter pounds on the door . > sigh ! < Maybe next time ! 
As soon as I'm through with the Guardianship hearing , I can start work on my tractor's loader . There'll be some modification on the hydraulic system to support addional items . 
The guardianship hearing went as smooth as silk ! We were in and out , and the guardianship was renewed before I realized what happened . < PROPFEMALE > captured the Judge's heart when she texted him , \Thank you your honor ! \"" 
Woke up this morning before daylight , ad got to watch the day wake up . I haven't done that for a long while . It's one of the things I miss about being in the Army . I used to turn off my mind while running PT and listen . Just listening to the crunching of the gravel or slapping of shoes on the pavement as the birds , one by one wake up and start chirping . 
As the mist or fog would drift down to where we were running , it would bring the scent of pine to us . Many times , I wondered how many other soldiers realized the same things . 
I spent a few hours at my sister's repairing her hot water heater . Turned out to be a simple inlet pipe replacement . It was nice to have some family time . My girls and I are mostly loners by choice , so this was a treat of sorts .

Entitlement programs are nothing new . My father had an entitlement program : The day after we graduated he told us if we preferred to starve instead of work , we're entitled . 
Antiquis temporibus , nati tibi similes in rupibus ventosissimis exponebantur ad necem . Translated : In the good old days , children like you were left to perish on windswept crags .

I have a question about this CO2/Algore crap . Don't trees need CO2 to live ? Won't we asphyxiate trees by cutting back on CO2 ? That lends the question ; what does Algore have against trees ? He's out to kill trees ! Why ? He's out to build his zombie army of trees to take over the world ! 
Nice fall morning . Is it still fall ? The sky is clear , the trees are frosted , the mud in the yard is iced .... Yeah , the yard is a mud bog because of Washington rain . :( I have to drive my truck onto my yard so my daughter won't get soaked while I < PROPFEMALE > her down the walkway . Last night , I had to recover my new truck out with my older truck . Reminds me of my time in the Army ! :^) 
Oh yeah ! That reminds me ; Yesterday morning ; Again , cold crisp air ... Scent of pine in the air ... I started my truck and caught the scent of diesel exhaust . That took me right back to the artillery motorpool in Germany with the self propelled artillery's engines warming up while the crew were doing their vehicle maintenance and training .

Today , I saw the truck I gave away to the single parent who needed it . Looks like it's holding up well for him and his son . They looked happy together driving down the road . It looks like his luck turned out better for him . :^) Life is good !

So much for tilling alfalfa into my garden ! All I managed to do is is make adobe ! The soil is still too wet to plow or till . I'll need at least three days of no rain to make this work .

I have an appointment today for a catscan and a MRI this evening at the VA hospital . It'll be interesting to see what they find .

Warm and < PROPFEMALE > yesterday and today ! Looks like it's going to be this way for the rest of the week . After that ? Who knows ! This is WASHINGTON !!! ( State , that is ! ) 
I am sooooo PISSED off !!! I needed to change a brake line on my truck . I got it change and got my daughter to assist in bleeding the brakes when I discovered the part I replaced was DEFECTIVE !!! I ended up getting drenched in brake fluid ! The only saving grace was the Ford part person at the dealership said I can exchange it if I found it defective . Unfortunately , the dealership is closed today . 
Once again , Murphy strikes again ! If I don't get the parts tomorrow , it could be as late as next week before I can get the parts on . Tomorrow , overcast skies . After that , 50% or better < PROPMALE > of rain until thursday . After that ? Who knows ! This ... Is ... WASHINGTON !!! 
( It's a diesel , so it doesn't produce a vacuum on it's own . It needs a \ 
vacuum pump to operate the air conditioning/heat controls as well as the\ 
auto locking hubs . ) However , I tested the vacuum system and found it \ 
was holding vacuum . \ 
The reason I thought it may be the vacuum system is .... continued ... 
I had a similar \ 
problem last year when I had a locking hub problem . Because the cruise \ 
control and the shifter's interlock are both having problems at the same\ 
time , I'm starting to think it may be the interlock switch between the \ 
brakes and the shifter .... Continued ... 
I discovered the reason I can't find the internal overrunning clutch for\ 
my tractor is Bolens/Iseki calls it a cam clutch ! I still have to \ 
replace the two safety switches on my riding mower . The AutoCAD program \ 
is for another project . I'll tell yall when I get to it . 
re : Truck's problem . It was the brake switch . Apparently , \ 
Ford uses the same switch in their Superdutys for their brakes lights and their\ 
cruise control/shifter interlock . I had to dig around to find a wiring\ 
schematic for my truck . Once I found that , it was easy to determine it was the\ 
brake switch on the brake pedal . \ 
Now to find my AutoCAD program and repair my tractor . Two down , and two more to go ! 
Actually , I do NOT like Domino's pizza ! The new recipie has < PROPFEMALE > peppers in it . It tears my and my daughters stomachs up .

I'm not feeling well ! I think it's just a cold . Some sleep , lots of fluids , and < PROPFEMALE > lemon tea should do the trick . Lil one made a Japanese soup that's supposed to help for me . I blame < PROPFEMALE > ! She had the sniffles first ! 
All cat owners ! ATTENTION !!!! This is a * MUST DO* ! Go to the local Halloween store , and buy a set of cat ears , the type that go on your head . While your cat isn't watching , put them on , then find your cat . Watch the expression ( body language ) of your cat ! You may want to have someone record what happens . It's something that you may want to put on You Tube !
