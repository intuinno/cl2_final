i don't think thoughtlessness is ever an option for me ... 
cleaned out the car , cleaned out the garage , cleaned out the utility room , cleaned out the closet , cleaned the house ... clean feels good !!! 
what do you when it is raining and you can't go for a walk ... clean apparently ...!! 
i guess i have a lot of giftings .. but sitting still is clearly not one of them ...

cleaned out the files .. 
cleaned under the fridge ... 
hmmm ... 
i had hoped that spring was not simply visiting , but had planned to stay until summer ... oh cold weather , don't take this the wrong way .. but could you please go away ..!! 
did't let myself cop out on a new experience .. turns out it wasn't so bad after all ... of course , I didn't know what I was doing .. haha .. yah , that was probably pretty obvious .. still glad that I plunged .. 
i have jury duty tomorrow ... yay me ... 
completed my patriótic service in less than three hours and without any bloodshed ...
