The Mad Hatter is by far my favourite character in literature and film . Anyone want to see < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland with me when it opens ? I'll come dressed as the Mad Hatter :D 

Insofar as every debate goes , we are limited to one outcome . Two close-minded individuals/groups trying to destroy the other's beliefs . From this we have created the greatest predicament possible , that being of an unteachable generation ! 
Psalm 130:3 -4 ( NKJV ) If You , LORD , should < PROPFIRST > iniquities , O Lord , who could stand ? But there is forgiveness with You , That You may be feared .

Psalm 59:16 -17 ( NKJV ) But I will sing of Your power ; Yes , I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning ; For You have been my defense And refuge in the day of my trouble . To You , O my Strength , I will sing praises ; For God is my defense , My God of mercy .

From now until Friday all my comments are limited to \WOOO ! \"" 
Psalm 127:1 -2 ( NKJV ) Unless the LORD builds the house , They labor in vain who build it ; Unless the LORD guards the city , The watchman stays awake in vain . It is vain for you to rise up early , To sit up late , To eat the bread of sorrows ; For so He gives Hi 
Why do so many Christians say God is a god of love . It's not Biblical ! God IS love , the pure embodiment of what love is like . Why would we even consider limiting Him to \of love\ " when He is love ? " 
1 < PROPFIRST > 4:19 ( New < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Version ) We love Him because He first loved us . 
Omelettes are the manliest food in the world ! 
My name is Giaour ! 
Romans 3:19 -20 ( NKJV ) Now we know that whatever the law says , it says to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God . Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sigh

1 < PROPFIRST > 2:9 -11 ( New < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Version ) He who says he is in the light , and hates his brother , is in darkness until now . He who loves his brother abides in the light , and there is no cause for stumbling in him . But he who hates his brother is in darkness a 
We got a new Kitten and we named it ... ODO ! Why did we name our pet after a < PROPFEMALE > Trek character you ask ? Well ... I wanted to name him Nietzsche or Origen ... maybe even < PROPMALE > for a kick ... but NOOOO ! 
Man created religion because God was too complicated . 
Macbeth , A5 S5 : Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , creeps in this petty pace from day to day , to the last syllable of recorded time ; and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to < PROPFIRST > death . Out , out , brief candle ! Life's but a walking shadow , 
1 Corinthians 10:31 ( New < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Version ) Therefore , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the < PROPFEMALE > of God .

It turns out the most stolen item from Christian book stores are those little armbands that say WWJD ... 
Apparently there's a snickers protein bar ... 
Someone put chocolate on top of the foxtel box . It melted over everything ! Nice and tasty though . Mmmmm , melted chocolate ... 
Wow , 9 engagements in the span of a week . I want to add to that to give it the nice even number of 10 ... which means I have to meet a girl and \woo\ " her by Sunday . Eh screw it ... " 
Does anyone out there know why so many Christians teach about hell and rules ? What I find in scripture is God's love ... and God asking us to love others . Why then do you we condemn people with law ? 
Did I miss a meeting ? 
\The pawn is the soul of chess . \ " - François-André Danican Philidor " 
I'm absolutely sure I missed a meeting ! 
People ! I caved into peer pressure ... and got a haircut . 
So , I'm hungry and I have a < PROPFEMALE > to cook brownies . It's either that ... or I can make an omolette as any 20 year old male should . 
That's it ! After watching Cirque du Soleil I've decided to train as a contortionist ... 
MMMM ... oreos for breakfast . 
Great Neptune's Man Nipples ! It's talk like a pirate day ! ARRRRR ! 
I swear ... by Friday I'm going to learn how to play harmonica ! 
Step 1 complete . I have a Hohner < PROPFEMALE > Band D harmonica , and I also have a < PROPFIRST > Oskar C harmonica . Personally I like the Hohner < PROPFEMALE > Band D , it looks cooler and it sounds better . 
My last coffee was 3 days ago ! Someone get me a flat white NOW ! 
Last assignment for the term is officially completed and handed in . Now ... time to cut back on caffein and get some sleep . 
has just discovered a new love for men , ripped , tanned men with waxed chests . I LOVE MEN !! 
Ok everyone ... how exactly shall I get revenge against Hux for getting on my facebook and posting the below comment ? I'm leaving this poll open ... leave a comment below . I'm thinking of getting waxed , ripped and tanned and showing up at his house wearing a mankini . We'll record whatever I do and post it on youtube so leave your suggestions . 
The past week I have attempted to read the Twilight series . < PROPFEMALE > Meyer's style of writing has so discusted me that I burnt all the books . I think what made me do it was her incessant need to describe and then redescribe the appearance of attractive male characters . It seems the books are only there to showcase her abilities to create \boy candy\ " . Photos will be uploaded soon . " 
The greatest thing that happened to Christianity was the Bible being translated for all to interpret for themselves . The WORST thing that happened to Christianity was the Bible being translated for all to interpret for themselves . 
Breaking < PROPMALE>'s new album is sweet ! 
I have a lazy eye ! My left eye reads the books ... my right eye waits till the movie comes out , sitting in his recliner chair with a pack of popcorn . 
Hey ... don't mind me if I doze off while all you poor kids complain about assignments being due . I happen to have 2 weeks free from assignments . Time to catch up on sleep while you all overdose on caffein . ( snore ) 
I'll get you next time < PROPMALE > ! * Shakes fist sporadically * 
I had a strange dream last night where < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was pulling cats out of my mouth while quoting Thoreau in < PROPFIRST > Bly's voice . 
I miss those days when I knew everything :D . Why can't I be 15 again ? 
Yes ... that is a bow in my hair . Do I feel manly ? You bet ! 
\The perception of beauty is a moral test . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Thoreau "

Mmmm ... half-melted chocolate . It's all melty , and gooey ... and chocolaty . Oooh and it's got a caramel centre ... all covered in melty chocolate ... 
I think I'm going to read the Barnes and < PROPMALE > Classics collection . That's about ... 150 books or so ? Shouldn't be too hard . I'll be done by the weeks end ! 
Am I any better ...? 
Everyone , I am happy to announce that I have a nose ! 
In somewhere between 2 and 3 hours I'll be bonding with other guys ( and possibly girls ) in the manliest way possible . Stuffing our faces with meat and meat related products whilst boasting of our own grandeur , overshadowed by the occasional grunt , belch or growl due to mistaken possession of a plate of baby-back ribs . To Jötunheimr I go and to Valhalla I depart ! Please ... no vegans . 
Hey ... boys and girls from CMC . < PROPFIRST > wrote 7000 (+) words on his theology assignment ( < PROPMALE > is 2000 ) . If you think you can't reach the limit ... you = sad . 
Ooooooh ... baby . I'm hungry for some salt-water taffee right now . Oh baby ... that's such good < PROPFEMALE > . 
You gotta be kidding me ... on the first day AFTER I finish class I get sick and vomit . RAWRAWR !!!!!!! 
Christ didn't die so I can eat a pig . One verse in the New Testament doesn't outlaw a whole book in the Old Testament ( Leviticus ) . Sure ... following those commands won't get you to heaven , but remember God's law wasn't given to get you into heaven but as an outward sign that you belong to Him . Thereby ... I believe the food laws still apply . 
Mmmm ... swimming hole . 
Mmmm ... Gardners Falls swim was awesome ! Slightly sunburned ... though had a great time . 
He may have been an idiot ... but I love Baron Münchhausen . God bless people who can pull stories out of their own methane emissions and have them turned into a movie some 200 years later . 
Cogito ergo est . I think , therefore you is . 
I think for the next week I'll talk to myself , twitch when people touch me , and laugh at unexpected times . Oh wait ... that's just like every day . 
\What is tolerance ? It is the consequence of humanity . We are all formed of frailty and error ; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly — that is the first law of nature . \ " - Voltaire " 
I just got a job at Saint < PROPFIRST>'s Lutheran College . That's the plus side to it . The minus side is I now have 200 pages of forms to fill out because I work for a private school . Well ... I guess I'm off to read government literature ! 
Why do we focus so much on the New Testament and ignore the Old Testament ? Reading the New Testament more than the Old Testament is like buying a book and only reading the ending . If you don't know how the story progressed to the final place ... then you know nothing . The ending of a book does n o-o ne good if you haven't read the beginning or the journey that preceeded it . 
I start work tomorrow . Should be pretty fun :D 
We took the kids at work swimming today . Incidentally ... I went swimming in jeans and fully clothed because the kids pushed me in . My phone went in ... and it still works ! 
I used to shave with my samurai sword ! 
So , I'm currently reading the Meditations of < PROPMALE > Aurelius , Candide by Voltaire , the Confessions of Saint < PROPFIRST > , the Siddharthe by Hermann Hesse , Tao Te < PROPFEMALE > by Lao Tzu , and Walden and Civil disobedience by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Thoreau . Anything else I should add to my list ? 
Check out my bazillion ab muscles ... 
Has anyone else ever attempted to deceive a friend into believing \Je M'appelle\ " means \ " I love you\ " in French ? " 
If tapped , a < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > roundhouse kick could power Australia for 44 minutes . 
Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish . 
I'm making it my goal to be as ripped as < PROPMALE > Black by January 1 , 2010 . Does anyone know which steroids he used ? 
< PROPMALE > Hunt and < PROPFIRST > Deagon are both manwhores , but I'd never tell you that would I ? 
The DeLorean DMC-12 is the only car for me ! 
Got to sleep at 3:00 this morning and it is now 8:00 . Man can survive off of 5 hours of sleep right ? Feeling like your head has just been crushed by a car is normal right ? 
Made onion soup . Tried onion soup . Decided onion soup tasted like bad onions in hot water . Gave up on onion soup . 
< PROPFIRST > Callas ... wierdest comedian ever . 
A leader is best when people barely know that he exists , not so good when people obey and acclaim him , worst when they despise him . Fail to honor people , They fail to honor you . But of a good leader , who talks little , when his work is done , his aims fulfilled , they will all say , \We did this ourselves . \"" 
Psychic convention cancelled due to unforseen circumstances . 
Note to self ... don't cook pasta whithout a shirt . 
Went to Gardener's Falls today with Wouter Mostert , < PROPMALE > Mialkowski , and < PROPFIRST > Gottschalk . Ended up wasting pretty much all my money on fuel and coffee . Lucky I get payed tomorrow . 
Someday I'll have an Ocelot and I'll name it < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Dalí i Domènech . 
Back to the Future 3 is on TV tonight . On a side note ... the actor who plays < PROPMALE > in Scrubs is the Doc's nephew . Ah yes ... greatness begets greatness . 
I'm slightly annoyed . I'm only getting 2 hours of work this week . Bah ! 
I have a new cat . My sister named him Pumpkin but I calm him Wilhelm . He's the runt in the litter and is blind in one eye ... but he's the cutest thing ever ( hence why I named him after Nietzsche ) . 
Funny Comment Pending ... ... ... ... Please Hold . 
I'm Will Ferrell by the way . 
Do you want to touch my beard ? 
< PROPMALE > Cosby rants are my favourite past time . 
New New facebook pisses me off . I want Old New facebook back ... 
I finally have a day this week where I'm not going to be ludicrously far out of town or where I'm not working . It's so emotional ... I think I'm going to cry ! 
My nose tells me you have cookies ... GIVE THEM TO ME ! 
Gotta look good in a loin-cloth in 4 weeks . No time for food ... no time for food ... only time for sit-ups ! 
Gotta look good in a loin-cloth in 3 weeks . No time for food ... no time for food ... only leg curls . Note to self ... wax legs and loin-cloth zone ... 
I had the weirdest dream last night . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and I were knights on a crusade to find something . I don't know what it is because < PROPFIRST > took a wrong turn and got us lost ... 
I showed up to a party with Lady Gaga . We wore the same outfit . I died a little inside ... 
Must look good in a loin-cloth in 2 weeks ... pictures will come soon . 
I make loin-cloths work ... or so I've been informed ... 
Someday I'll write a multiple choice quiz where the answer to every question is ' C ' . How far into the quiz do you think it'll take for people to start freaking out ? 
I have a laptop . He wears a loin-cloth . 
IT just so happens that the best way to celebrate the death and resurrection of our Lord and Savior is by telling little children that a Giant < PROPFEMALE > Rabbit lay chocolate eggs in the night . 
Ah ... finished my first assignment for the semester with three hours to spare . 
Goodbye luscious curls ! I'm cutting 80% of it off ... 
< PROPMALE > is awesome :) 
Has anyone else noticed that < PROPFIRST > Cera is getting younger and younger ? 
Exhausted while Driving , passing out now ...... * crash**bang**horrible accident * 
Sorry , can't go out with you tonight . I have to feed my pet llama 
I have shaved ... and in the process I have clogged the sink with black wads of facial pubes . Anyone want to come over and unclog my sink ? 
According to < PROPFIRST > 13 Jesus spoke in parables to confuse people , not to make it easier for people to comprehend . Go ahead , read it ... and enjoy . 
I would marry coffee if it were legal :D 
System of a Down ... how I miss thee ! 
Jar Jar Binks for President . We all know he'd be better than Bush ! 
There's nothing manlier than that guy's moustache from the Chunky Fully Loaded commercial . 
Can't sleep , clowns will eat me . Can't sleep , clowns will eat me . Can't sleep , clowns will eat me . 
First iPad , next iSatelite . I'm still waiting for an iBed though . 
Rawr ! 
< PROPFIRST > Deagon and < PROPMALE > Hunt are my secret lovers ... 
Where are my loin-cloth photos ! 
3 assignments to hand in today . WOOOO ! 
I'm reading \Led by the Spirit\ " by Dr Vic Pfitzner . Yes ... that is EXACTLY how you spell his name and yes I am wondering how you pronounce it ... " 
I just realised that I haven't experienced the 5 gum feeling yet . Am I chewing it wrong ? 
Off to the < PROPFEMALE > Coast ! Woooo ! 
Late for breakfast must skip college and get more sleep . Wait ... 
I lost my shame , someone help me find it ! 
I have a < PROPFIRST > Hey action figure . It comes with an N.T Wright doll and a Constablemobile as well . :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D 
Did you know yoghurt is a living organism ... 
Extreme Narcisism ? Oh I love you < PROPFIRST > . Oh yes I know you love me , but I love you so much more than you love me . No that can't be possible , nothing can love me more than I can . Oh kiss me < PROPFIRST > or I'll make you kiss me ( embraces self and starts making out ) ... 
I'll wax my whole body , save face and head , if I can get enough people to like this post . 
It turns out he Master Chief is a < PROPMALE > pop < PROPFEMALE > ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UYTCbKxnjE 
I'm trying to think of something funny to say that relates to todays events . Unfortunatly I have nothing ... so you'll just have to amuse yourself by mentally replacing this text with a witty comment of your own . In the mean time ... I seem to have some nerve and muscle damage done to my foot , somehow related to my broken toe . Awesome ... 
Put my full name into google images and it comes up with a bunch of male underwear models . Looks like I have a new career plan ! 
It seems that I have inherited some pet rats ... Should I be happy or annoyed ? 
I don't feel any peace about it all ... 
Try # 2 . If we can get 50 people to like \

head ) . Better get the wax ready < PROPMALE > Hall . 
Let's get me half naked and bloody again , for old time's sake ! 
Cooking with Tyler : When it comes to omolettes , always remember it is possible to make a very MANLY omolette , even without meat . I have used red and green capsicum , jalepeno peppers , onion , and mushrooms . Mushrooms act as the replacement for the meat , and whilst not having much flavor themselves it is possible to add extra bite that mixes well with the previously mentioned fungi . 
Tired , annoyed , sick and not very social at the moment , and yet people refuse to give me space . Is there a reason I can't get 10 minutes to myself during my day off ? 
I feel displaced ... and like I miss someone ... 
This life is not godliness , but growth in \ 
godliness ; not health but healing ; not being , but becoming ; not rest , \ 
but exercise . We are not now what we shall be , but we are on the way ; \ 
the process is not yet finished , but it has begun ; this is not the goal , \ 
but it is the road ; at present all does not gleam and glitter , but \ 
everything is being purified . 
Henceforth Wouter Mostertshall be known as Woutiepoo ! 
Computer table just snapped with me sitting at it . A badly placed nail fell onto groin ... not a nice feeling ... especially with a fairly heafy computer on it . Oh gravity , you are a cruel master ! 
What did I do today ? Well , I took a break from ... pretty much everything ... and decided to play Spore . About an hour into it after entering the Space Stage I just HAPPENED to find Earth ( of all things ) . Now , did I learn anything today ? Why of course ! I found out that destroying this damned planet is absolutely hilarious , especially when coupled with manic , evil laughter . MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! 
Off to visit < PROPFEMALE > on Sunday . Mmmmmm ... < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Make like a tree and get out of here ! ( Wait a minute ? ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Custance is facebook stalking me ! Someone help ! 
Just turned on Cartoon Network on Foxtel to see what was on . Poor Cartoon Network ... she'll never be the same . RIP the Cartoon Network of my youth ... when they had shows like < PROPFIRST > Bravo , Cowboy Bebop , Ghost in the Shell , Trigun , Saumari < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE>'s Laboratory , Courage the Cowardly Dog , Captain Planet , The Powerpuff Girls , ThunderCats , and all those other greats . You will be missed . ( Cartoon Network 1995-2005 ) 
Guess what ... I lost my voice ! Great timing too ... 
Anyone need a lift to Spiritual Retreat camp ... cause I just got given permission to attend . WOOO ! 
I have decided that I am now a supporter of Modalist Theology . Haha , just kidding . I wouldn't do that to you < PROPFIRST > Pukallus ... or would I ? 
Greek salad ... yum ... 
Last night was terrible . I've been sick for the last few days , and last night I had one of those nights where EVERYTHING would stop me from getting to sleep . I'd just be about to drift off ... and then the dog would bark , or my phone would beep ( Despite being on silent ? ) . Eventually I was laying in bed and looked out the window ... and it was light . I spent 8 HOURS trying to sleep ... I got NOTHING ! 
It used to be called \contemporary\ " . Some call it \ " relevant\ " . We're so cool \ 
????? 
When the Sting retires will he be called the Stung ? 
I think I'll start working out 24 hours a day until I have a body like < PROPMALE > Mustafa , become a celebrity for appearing on TV wearing only a towel , learn to ride a Zebra backwards , and eventually replace < PROPFIRST > Lautner as < PROPMALE > Black . Someday I shall be nominated Mr. Universe , become a successful Austrian actor with a focus on action movies , and then eventually be nominated Governor of California . 
Paperwork ... YAY ! 
I now have a deviantart site . The link to my < PROPFEMALE > is in my info . Have a look :D 
I just watched Inglorious Basterds . I think the Nazis are the good guys in that movie ... and the Jews are the bad guys ...

Must break that ankle to show my dedication ! \

Got a shipment of books today . Wooo ! Now I can get started on my assignments . \ 
Perhaps I shall procrastinate some more . 
Squash Physics 101 : When carelessly thwacking the ball in a last ditch effort to save your ass , you will observe the phenomenon of Squash < PROPFEMALE > which , in relation to < PROPMALE>'s Law states that any incedent of pain , whether intentional or not , shall result in an equal negative reaction , resulting in the ball also damaging you . In essence , what goes around comes around ... at 60+KpH ... into your balls .

I got payed for 4 hours of work rather than 3 and it wasn't a mistake . Life is awesome ! 
Is there a vet in the room ? Cause these puppies are sick ! \

I think I'll cosplay as the Old Spice guy ... Just gotta find a nice towel ! 
< PROPFIRST > Muller and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > conned me into played Dungeons and Dragons tonight . Did I enjoy it ? Well , do you think you'll enjoy petting my level 9 Druid Human while he is in Primeval Bear form using his Pounce ability ? If no ... then YOU FAIL ! \ 
Now , where do I find a life ? 
My Cabbages ! 
Perhaps I should get a tattoo of Chip Esten so when people ask me if I have a problem I can show them the chip on my shoulder . 
Back in Brisbane for a week . Wooo ! \ 
* Dies from boredom * 
Would you believe that there are baby photos of me on facebook ? 
We < PROPFIRST > some days as fair , some as foul , because we do not see that the character of every day is identical . 
No ! My phone is displaying the White Screen of Broken Mobile Death ! Send me text messages so I CAN'T read them ! 
Coffee is good for the soul . 
Just butchered my legs on a late-night random 6Km run . Anyone want to help me stand up ? I can't feel any leg ... only SEARING PAIN !

Beard wisdom always come first before study wisdom . 
Perhaps running in the nude will rectify the problem of the heat and humidity . But the question remains . Do I want a criminal record for indecent exposure at the expense of comfort/health ? 
Think I'll win 25 million in the lotto over the holidays then write an autobiography about making my first million titling it Simply Had Hope and bullshit my way into celebrity status . I'll < PROPFEMALE > in a show called The Complicated Life but before it airs cause scandal by running nude in Central Park . Later I'll have my millions , but my image will be that of a scandalous party girl . Ms < PROPMALE > how you have inspired me . 
Back in Brisbane as of 4 hours ago . Woot ! 
SOAD is back for a reunion tour ! \ 
THE SYSTEM IS BACK ! 
Pitching my new show to various studios . Perhaps Fox will be interested in \Dancing with the Stars of David . \"" 
Minecraft tip 101 : You may use water springs to make a temporary ( or permanent if needed ) quick transportation system . When you encounter a deep chasm set up a stone block in the air ( by building stones from the closest wall over to it ) and then place the waterspring on top of it . The spring will turn into multiple waterfalls . Remove the stone block , and you may now travel up and down the waterfall quite quickly . 
I taste salami ... 
I have a nice developing blue lump on my jaw . One of my teeth hurts as well , and for some reason I can't hear from my right ear . \ 
Apparently I was hit in the face by a squash ball . Hey ! Does anyone know if I won that game ? 
I'm hungry . 
Piss off new facebook experiences . No , I don't want to try the new facebook look . Let me live in my close-minded world . \ 
P.S. I'm still hungry . 
Mayhaps I shall watch Serenity . 
Good night peoples ... 
I woke up with a shoe in my mouth . Wondering who owns it . Call 1800 My Shoe or contact me at NotMine@MyShoe.com . Don't forget to include a picture of the other shoe just to prove it's yours , and possibly pictures of your feet . I like feet ... \

Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side was almost as fast as Bush's decline in popularity . \

There's nothing better than home-made chili on a hot day . 
Red's new album comes out tomorrow . 
New clothes I ordered from the USA finally arrived today . Happy to say they all fit ... cept one pesky pair of shorts ( which are EXACTLY the same size as the others ... wtf ? ) . I declare that by the end of February my ass shall fit perfectly into them !

< PROPFIRST > Muller cooked Kangaroo burgers for dinner ... 
Hmmm .... what to have for dinner tonight . \ 
I could make a delicious stew that would last for several days . Mayhaps with some steak meat , some potatoes and lots of peas and carrots . Otherwise I could just cook the steak and eat it as a steak with mashed potatoes and peas and carrots on the side . \ 
What to do ! There are so many choices ! 
Ancient Hebrew exam in the morning , and then < PROPFIRST > de Florette . I don't know which one was more horrifying ! 
Great job ALC ... you've assign < PROPMALE > me field < PROPMALE > that is 3 hours walking distance away ... and the ONLY public transport that will get me to the 9:00 service on time requires that I wake up at 4:22 in the morning and arrive at 7:22 . Have you perhaps forgotten that I DON'T HAVE A CAR ! 
To beard or not to beard ... that is the question ... 
Someone asked me to critique a short story of theirs . I did , pointing out places for improvement , places that didn't make sense , things that should be cut , and grammatical mistakes . They told me I \have a heart of refrigerated steel\ " and that if they took all my advice the story wouldn't exist . My reply was \ " That's the point . \"" 
From now on I shall cease wearing pants ... and instead wear pantaloons ... 
I just realized that Spongebob Squarepants makes more sense in languages that I don't understand . \ 
Here's proof http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqu6Xu_aW-Q 
I have discovered that < PROPFEMALE > tomatoes , when baked in the oven , can make a naturally sweet pasta sauce . Add other complimentary veges to the mix to make it even more delicious . I used garlic ( of course ) , chili peppers , black olives , red onion and red capsicum . It went pretty damn good with chicken , but I think it would go beautifully with salami and/or chorizo too ( or all three combined ) . 
Ancient Hebrew exam tomorrow morning . YAY ! \ 
* Grumble * 
Tonight I met < PROPMALE > at the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Club . He is 83 , turning 84 , and he fought in WW2 for the < PROPMALE > s as a machine gunner . Got him a beer and heard some great stories . 
Ran 6KM in less than 30 mins . Wooo ! \ 
Now for the most fat filled food I can find to warrant such an awesome run . I'm not going to eat it , only stare at it and think about how delicious it is .

Can't sleep ... gotta learn 80 Hebrew words AND their \alternate forms\ " by tomorrow . " 
Exam is finished and the beard is headed down the pipes somewhere below us . It will reach the sewers where it will be found by the other abandoned wisdom beards who will induct it into their circle of power . After years of conspiracy these neglected beards will band together to create one massive hairy monster that will come to our surface world and wreak havoc upon those who abandoned it . \ 
Wait ... what was I saying ? 
MacGyver and Espresso = pure awesome . 
I think I'm going to show up at the opening night showing of Avatar 2 as Captain Planet .

Can I get an amen ! 
Caffeine staves off depression in women . That's why women should date men with a caffeine addiction . You know they'll always have a few kilos of the stuff at home ... just in case you need a fix . 
I'd totally date Simba . \ 
Well ... aside from the claws ... and the teeth ... and the daddy issues ... and the fact that he's a male . He's also a cat . \
