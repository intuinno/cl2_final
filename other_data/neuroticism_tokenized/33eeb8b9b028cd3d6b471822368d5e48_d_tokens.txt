a few moments of quiet solace is all i need .

ok everyone ! JR's party is Saturday the 29th at one ! Everyone is invited ! The theme is Dinosaurs and if you have a young child , they will be able to participate in the < PROPMALE > dig , so dress them in play clothes ! 
my phone is acting a fool and not charging ... 
i am so tired . i feel fuzzy . 
my tummy hurts , but there are chores to be done :( 
getting brand new hardwood floors at the expense of my entire downstairs being deemed unusable . 
I was politely asked to leave the job site . i was too nitpicky about the how the floors were being done ... but , they fixed it . nothing like a woman's eye to make sure the job is done right 
Taco bowls for dinner , but with all the men in the house I think I should have made more ... 
Its easy to forget why we facebook in the first place . I know I use it to upload photos of my family for my friends to see and to stay connected with people I think are good people . But being mean and saying things that are double sided are hurtful . If you write anything like I just described on my < PROPFEMALE > or status I will delete you as a friend 
day started off a little rough , but it's Monday so its not really unexpected . 
how do i spend all morning cleaning and the house still looks like a toys r us tornado hit ? 
don't know what to make for dinner , don't want to fry chicken tenders but i thawed out tenders accidentally ... 
definitely going to need some prayers from now until Thursday ! It's going to be a long three days ... 
My daughters are amazing . They are too silly . I'm so happy for the life I was given .
