my cousin is a retard ! ... but so funny :-) 
note to self : when you next buy a car , invest in one with the keypad on the door ... that way you won't ever have to worry about locking your keys in your car AGAIN !!! 
been watching 1,000 ways to die for the last couple of hours and i can't figure out why i'm so hooked on it ? it's so morbid ... maybe it's like a train wreck , you know what's gonna happen but you just can't look away ? 
I ain't happy\ 
I'm feeling glad\ 
I got sunshine in a bag\ 
I'm useless\ 
But not for long\ 
The future is coming on 
lovin ' me some jackass :-) can't wait for the new movie ! 
Don't say a word , just come over and lie here with me\ 
' Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see\ 
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe\ 
There I just said it , I'm scared you'll forget about me 
so effing tired ! why am i always exhausted on days i don't do anything at school ? it makes no sense ! 
chillin ' at the cousin's shop tomorrow , gonna learn me some tricks of the trade :-) 
\A closed mouth gathers no feet . \ " <<< note to self : apply this to everyday life " 
jackass 3D tonight with < PROPFIRST > R . Hickey , hell yes !!! :-D 
will actually get to cut some hair tomorrow , woot ! 
sitting here bored outta my mind at school ... but what else is new ? 
It's said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up like they spoke just yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live . They don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will always love them . Re- ... post if you have at least one of these friends ? 
bed sounds super good right about now ... but i know i won't be able to sleep for awhile , i can never sleep on friday nights , stupid school on saturday mornings :-P 
\Why is the rum gone ? \"" 
I was a heavy heart to < PROPFEMALE > , My beloved was weighed down\ 
My arms around his neck , My fingers laced to crown\ 
I was a heavy heart to < PROPFEMALE > , But he never let me down\ 
When he held me in his arms , My feet never touched the ground 
i love catching up w/ old friends :-) especially one's that i've been missing like crazy for months 
was\ 
sick at school all freaking day and is still sick which means i had to \ 
cancel my halloween plans so i'm pretty pissed grrr ! ... hopefully watching \ 
the buckeyes crush some gophers will cheer me up 
mah , The Walking Dead was sweeeeeeeeeeeet !!! can't wait to see more ! :-) 
I'm broke but I'm happy , I'm poor but I'm kind\ 
I'm short but I'm healthy , yeah\ 
I'm high but I'm grounded , I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed \ 
I'm lost but I'm hopeful baby\ 
What it all comes down to is that everything is just fine fine fine ... 
i\ 
think one of < PROPFIRST > Fincher's prerequisites for his movies is that they \ 
must have good music ... just watched The Social Network , not only was \ 
it a great movie but the music was kick-ass as well ... of course i \ 
wouldn't expect anything less than great music from < PROPMALE > Reznor 
quote of the night : \I wanna make a rap parody that will keep drunk fat chicks off the dance floor . \ " ... LMAO classic !!! " 
Come on you raver , You seer of visions\ 
Come on you painter , you < PROPFEMALE > , you prisoner and SHINE ! 
IT'S PARTY TIME !!! :-D yay !

running on 2 hrs of sleep today :-P need caffeine !!! 
Hello again , friend of a friend\ 
I knew you when\ 
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end\ 
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend\ 
You crack the whip , shape-shift and trick\ 
The past again

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Re-post if this made you smile .

\The only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing . \"" 
If your Dad is , or was , a hard working man , has helped you no matter how good or bad you were ; if you are blessed to still have your Dad , or if he is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you can never replace your Dad 
sooo not gonna lie , Sucker Punch was kinda lame ... visually it was amazing , the storyline and the acting was poop bleh ! kinda upset i spent money to see it 
Living is easy with eyes closed\ 
Misunderstanding all you see\ 
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out\ 
It doesn't matter much to me 
really itching to get some new ink !!! i'm thinking maybe within the next few weeks , hopefully my financial situation will allow it !!!
