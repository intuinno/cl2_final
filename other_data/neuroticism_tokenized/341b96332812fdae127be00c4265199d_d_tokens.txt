HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY to a simply AMAZING best friend !!! I love ya < PROPFEMALE > Berlin !!!! 
Today's mantra : The treadmill is my friend and not the enemy . The treadmill is my friend and not the enemy . The treadmilll .... 
... finds it slightly amusing how excited I became when I found out that Papa < PROPFIRST>'s accepts WU Cafe Cash . 
use to be so punctual ... what happened ? :( 
According to www.urbandictionary.com ' < PROPFEMALE>' isn't defined yet ... brings back the days of not being able to find my name on the little name keychain things ... oh well . 
the window insulation in my room is a joke ! everytime the wind blows a ridiculous amount of cold air comes into my room . my pitiful attempt to stop the air with a blanket isn't working ... time to call WU maintenance * rolls eyes * 
the idiocy and pure laziness of some of my fellow college classmates never ceases to amaze me ... 
it's almost Friday ... it's almost Friday ... it's almost ... 
is completely bored :( 
is happy that my 8 o'clock class was canceled ( would've been even happier if my professor had sent out the e-mail last night so that I could have slept in this morning ... oh well ) 
For all the time , effort , and MONEY I've been putting into this , the American University in Cairo better accept me ... or they'll have a sad/depressed < PROPFEMALE > on their hands ... and nobody wants that ... right ? * sighs * 
... I miss my nose ring :( 
the only thing keeping me from telling this woman to do it her own damn self is the fact that I like getting a paycheck every two weeks ... 
loves when my boss asks me to do something and ends the request by saying , \ ... if you don't mind\ " . One of these days ... I just might say that I do ;) " 
is very happy to hear that < PROPFEMALE > Bullock won Best Actress for her role in ' The Blind Side ' ... 
is watching < PROPFEMALE > Meyer with my Dad (& hearts ;) ... I don't have the heart to ask him to turn the TV down ... I think he's going deaf . 
Alley Myers : \OMG < PROPFEMALE > ! The school could have blown up and I could have died !!!... are there any brownies left ? \"" 
loves her sister Alley Myers , but this chick is so dramatic . Seriously ... it's so hard to keep a straight face right now :P 
has received her government issued passport today . I am now free to travel all over the world ... heehee ( evil laughter ) ... 
is really ( really ) hoping that these next five weeks of classes goes by fairly quickly . 
needs a nap ... and a hug :( 
has been accepted to study at the American University in Cairo for the fall semester !! 
Today is NOT the day . As the temperature goes up , my level of patience/tolerance for crap goes down ... you have been warned :P 
is really proud of her mother < PROPFEMALE > Myers .... You go girl :) 
... shoulda , coulda , woulda ... but didn't :/ 
saw ' Death at a Funeral ' last night ... I'm not sure how I feel about it , but at least the company was good :) 
Some people just do not have any home training . Seriously , if you have a problem with how someone is handling a situation , then try talking with that person in a diplomatic way . Because nine times out of ten , if you go to them with a shi**y attitude you will not get the results that you want . The word for today is tact . Use it , embrace it . Being tactful can get you far . I promise . Thank you ... rant over . 
firmly believes in compromise . For instance , I can work on not taking everything personally , while others can work on their blatant hypocritical nature . Seriously , let's work on these issues together . Then everyone can have a good time ... 
always seems to be preparing for a confrontation that never happens :/ 
Really Oklahoma ??? REALLY ? I am so ashamed of my former homestate right now ... :(

feels the love ! A big thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday yesterday !! 
is proud to be the daughter of an Army veteran . Please remember what Memorial Day stands for ... 
is questioning whether or not < PROPFEMALE > really is a \virtue \"..." 
\Very often a change of self is needed more than a change of scenery\ " - A.C. Benson " 
is heading up to < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPMALE > Myers and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>' Myers ... a good time will be had by all :) 
\Every tomorrow has two handles . We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith\ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Beecher . " 
your unpredictable mood swings are tiring ... I don't see this day getting any better ... perhaps I should just go back to bed :/ 
would like to give a shout out to the USAA Auto Insurance department ... thank you . Thank you for finally sending me a proof of insurance card that had my correct information on it ( so proud of you) ! And it only took you four times to get it right ... let's hear it for incompetency !!! Hooray ! 
Wii !

shark week ! 
is wishing that she could talk to < PROPFEMALE > Berlin in person and not through Facebook ... BMW 
three weeks & counting ... 
cannot believe how so damn selfish people are ! FYI : You should be grateful that someone went out of their way , went that extra mile , to help you . I'm not saying kiss their a$$ , but a little appreciation wouldn't hurt :( 
would like to send a heartfelt message to my fantastic ( purple ) Blackberry : RIP ( January 2010-August 05 , 2010 ) ... it was fun while it lasted * tear *

Why doesn't AUC have a meal plan ??!!... I'm hungry :( 
so I went to a Bedouin Sohour ( desert , food , dancing , etc ) last night ... and I held a lion . No joke . A lion . Welcome to Africa !! Oh and I named the lion \Sarabi\ " ... first one to figure out the connection gets a prize ( not really) ! " 
had to cut a hole into my brand new shirt because a store clerk forgot to take the security tag off ... but the wonderfulness that is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > sewed it back up for me . Yay !

aaannnd the list entitled ' my regrets ' becomes longer ... 
loves productive days ! For instance , I am now fully caught up to the current season of NCIS ! ( FYI ... any comments made about ' priorities ' will be deleted :P ) 
has come to the conclusion that this world is filled with incompetent people . Therefore limited contact with others is a must ... if only to save what is left of my ( in)sanity ... 
... due to all the crap it's had to endure , my digestive system officially hates me . It's currently plotting it's revenge :( 
needs everyone ( everyone I say ) to be made aware of the fact that it is Ms. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s 21st birthday today !!!! Happy Birthday to the awesomeness that is you ! Love and miss you girl ! Don't get too crazy tonight , lol ! =D 
is very tired . Why ? Well , to get home I had to catch a 20 < PROPFEMALE > cab ride to the Metro station . Rode the Metro through 8 stops , got off of said Metro and caught another train \ 
heading in a different direction . Then had another 20 < PROPFEMALE > taxi ride . Then took the 8:00 bus ( which is a 45 < PROPFEMALE > drive ) back to New Cairo . All this to get back \ 
home . Awesome . On the upside , I had an enjoyable day today ! 
would like < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>' Myers to know that she is missed as well :) 
only needs 13 more credits before she receives her BA in Sociology/Criminology !!!! 
had an absolutely horrible day ... discovered that my tolerance for pain is non-existing . However , thanks to a charming taxi driver , a fantastic dinner and a slice of chocolate heaven for dessert , the day was able to end on a high note . < PROPMALE > hamdu lillah ... 
... this is your life . Are you who you want to be ? 
knows that everything will be alright in the world as long as I have a friend who is willing to dance to the ' Milkshake ' song right in the middle of McDonald's ... 
has a new roommate . My roommate's name is < PROPMALE > . < PROPMALE > is a mouse ... < PROPMALE > is not welcomed and needs to leave :/ 
must refrain from correcting the grammatical/spelling errors that are present in numerous Facebook posts ... must . refrain . from ... 
\ ... what's it gonna beeeeeeeee ..... eeeeeee ..... eeeeeee ?? \"" 
who got an 95% on her Arabic Midterm ? If you answered < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , then you would be CORRECT !! Now let's all take a moment to reflect on ( and possibly bow down to ... your call ) my awesomeness ! 
released my inner ninja when a Khan el-Khalili shopkeeper decided to infringe upon the sanctity that is my personal bubble ... 
stayed up til 3 am to catch a meteor shower ... and instead spent time looking at clouds and being chased by an evil cat . Still had fun with Kt < PROPFEMALE > though !! 
is chatting with the younger sibling . We're discussing Durkheim & his views on religion & how he thought it served to regulate/control individual desires ... sequestering deviance & all that ... Yeah right , we're crackin jokes & making fun of people , like always . Good times , good times :) 
has packed , unpacked and re-packed my suitcase for this three day trip several times . One would think that having been a military brat for the first seventeen years of my life , that I would have the < PROPMALE > of packing down but alas , I do not ... oh well . Greece ! 
wants Shereen A.Z. to know that she is loved !! 
can't believe that mi padre thinks that I am too old to be asking for Christmas presents ! That's too bad , because I'm e-mailing the old goat my Christmas list anyway ! :) 
wishes some professors held themselves to the same high standards that they hold for their students ... just saying :/ 
\ ... but you'll always be my hero ... even though you've lost your mind ... \""

Congratulations to the younger sibling , Ms. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>' Myers , for getting into the Ridge View HS Teacher Cadet Honors Program ! So proud !! ** sniffle ** I have taught you well ... you knew I was going to take some credit sooner or later =) 
moment of the night : watching Shereen A.Z. run away from a kitten ... such a precious Munchkin :D

Ugh ! What is this nonsense !? Snow in SC ??? I hate snow ... snow sucks ! 
Dear Body : For the past 4 days you have decided that 4:30 a.m. was an acceptable time to wake up . I am here to tell you that it is NOT . It is unacceptable and just plain cruel . I understand that you are suffering from jet lag but enough is enough . If you wake up tomorrow any earlier than 9:00 am , I will refuse to feed you . Don't look at this as punishment , but rather , as encouragement . - xoxo < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
is all dressed up with nowhere to go ... sadness 
can't believe that Kt < PROPFEMALE > is only three hours from Columbia & I can't see her ! Booo ! 
:D !! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ??? ????? ???? 
the month of May is shaping up quite nicely ... yes indeed =) 
drove all over Columbia ( not really ) to find a < PROPFEMALE>'s whose frosty machine was not broken . We found one =) 
let's see ... Cheesecake Factory with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > for dinner & news that classes are canceled tomorrow due to inclement weather ... this week is shaping up better than I thought it would =) 
Wow ! So I'm sitting in the campus police station , trying to register my car , when the officer on duty received a call where a person wanted to know if it was illegal to tie a sled to a car and drag a person along the highway . Cops must think we're all a bunch of idiots ! * smh * 
Another day of canceled classes . For anyone keeping count that's three days of no school . What's a girl to do ? So . Bored . 
Yay for roommates who like to share ! thanks < PROPFEMALE > Pratt :D 
is it sad that I found the bad guy , Chudnofsky , more likable than the Green Hornet's character ? Other than that , Green Hornet was an enjoyable movie . 
hopes that everyone is fortunate enough to have that one person in their life that will always be there for them , no matter what . Not to brag ( okay , I'm totally bragging ) , but I do and her name is Ms. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>' Myers . Seventeen years ago my partner in crime was born . Feliz Cumpleanos hermana ! May your day be filled with happiness and rainbows ! P.S. Sadly , it was not a brownie ;) 
feliz cumpleanos a mi mejor amiga < PROPFEMALE > Berlin ! BFFs since 8th grade , where would I be without the ' B ' to my & hearts ; BMW & hearts ; ? I hope that you're having a fun day , filled with happiness and rainbows ! =) 
1st day at my new job ... Hooray for steady income ! =) 
it's barely the second ( full ) week of classes and I already need a mental health day ( as Dr. < PROPFIRST > would say ) ... oy vey ! ( look at me , I'm rhyming ... ) 
rain + frightfully cold weather = sad < PROPFEMALE > ... 
is sooooo excited for May ! Graduations and weddings and birthdays , oh my ! =) 
one semester of Arabic ... here I go --> :( ???? ???? ???? 
watching a live feed ( www.cnn.com ) of Egyptian protesters waiting for President Mubarak's speech ... 
yo quiero hablar a mi amiga Kt < PROPFEMALE > !! damn Egyptian government :( 
of course my very last semester as an undergrad turns out to be the most chaotic . i'm in serious need of a mental health day ! 
from the New York Times ... \Egyptian state TV reports that an \ " important statement\ " from President Hosni Mubarak is expected soon .. \ " -looking forward to hearing this ... " 
Oh ! < PROPFEMALE > Berlin has NO idea what she's getting into ! Let the games begin ! :P 
is in love ... with this new Guess purse I just bought =) 
... soooo , am I the only one that doesn't care that today is Superbowl Sunday ? Anyone ? Anyone ? 
... Apparently I am out of the loop on this football phenomena ... \ 
\ 
Sibling : \Do you even know who's playing today ? \ " \ 
there is a clown making balloon animals on campus ... am I too old to get excited ? 
... any day now ... 
is amazed at how one can know an individual for only a couple of months and yet that person has such an impact/influence on one's life ... I miss KT & the Munchkin ... 
... eh ... no me gusta nueva cancion de Lady Gaga 
So , in an effort to be nice ( ugh ) , I told a guy in my class , who hadn't completed the reading , that he could look over my ( typed ) notes for the chapter . He glanced at my self-made study guide ( with noticeable disdain , I might add ) and then told me that I had too much time on my hands . Why do I waste my time ?
