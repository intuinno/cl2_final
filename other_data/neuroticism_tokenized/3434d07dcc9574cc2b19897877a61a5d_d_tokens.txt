This is some deep stuff that i wrote down today when teachers were boring me half to death . It's not about anyone in our school or anyone we know . His eyes are most amazing in the dark . They collect the shadows and shine with the light underneath them . So when you finally glance at those glistening eyes , you realize how much passion he holds inside . Love it don't ya ? 
I posted this earlier but i wanted to again for anyone who didn't see it . Some deep stuff that i wrote down today when teachers were boring me half to death . It's not about anyone in our school or anyone we know . His eyes are most amazing in the dark . They collect the shadows and shine with the light underneath them . So when you finally glance at those glistening eyes , you realize how much passion he holds inside . 
< PROPMALE > PROBLEM !!!!!!!!!! If you were having a huge party on saturday and it was considered a < PROPFIRST > au you would want to invite friends right ? Well who would u invite if your dad said u could invite only 1 person and all these names started drifting into your head ????? WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE ???? Put your answers in a comment below !!!! 
WHO'S GOING SKATING !!!!!!! :) 
NOBODY'S GOING SKATING !!!!!!!!!!!!!! UGH !!!!!!!! NOBODY'S ON EITHER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UGH !!!!!! Wah !!!!!!! I think i'm actually gonna cry !!!!!!!! 
My cat's an idiot . He tried to jump across my kitchen from the back of a chair , fell , got back up , and tried again . I also recently just learned that he is in actuality an alien . I was talking to < PROPFIRST > and my cat was trying to walk on my computer . I picked him up and moved him . As I set him down he growled at me . I'm not talking that whinning noise they make when angry . A kitten that weighs 5 pounds GROWLED at me ! 
Since when does a cat growl !!!!! I had never heard him growl so it freaked me out . The reason that he's an idiot is , i said he was an alien , right ? Well , if he ;s anything it should be a ghost . The cat's name is Casper for cryin ' out loud !!!!! I mean , who's ever heard of an alien named Casper !!!!!!!!!! My cat , Casper , is an idiotic alien . 
Whew ! I got to go do homework and i admitted something tonight that makes me not even the least bit releived !

Bored ..... Stupid homework ... I would still have someone to talk to if it weren't for books ... 
Heartbreak pulls on your shoulders .... the thought of him lingers in the corner of your mind .... The answers pound hard against the wall that appeared to seperate what's right and wrong . 
Just as you've made your desicion you walk away feeling proud ...... until you remember that whatyou two were feeling wasn't the same as before .... And you realize that there will always be so much more to see than heartbreak and blue eyes ...... 
confused ... horrible day at school .... y would u even want to write a phone number on your hand .... wat happens when u raise ur hand to answer a problem and the teacher sees it ?! ugh ............... confused ....... 
It wasn't me that had writing on my hand .... i'm angry at someone who wrote their phone number on someone's arm .... and i'm angry at the person that let them cuz she swore she wouldn't hurt me like that ........ 
Keep it positive !!!!! See you guys tommorow .....

I didn't know letting go of a friend could hurt so much . I guess that means that she was a great one . I'm crying harder than i did when my parents got divorced . Do you remember that < PROPFIRST > ? I called < PROPFIRST > because the good friend that i just lost was mad at me because we were in a fight . I'm sorry for wasting all those years of your life , i'm sorry for everything . :'( 
On one side of my mind i feel like i've let her go but on the other i feel like i should be friends with her because i'm sorry .... and she said she was sorry .... idk what to do .... fun tommorow ??? Nope don't think so

Borrred .... Stupid fortune cookies .... They gave us 3 so i ate two and one of them had two fortunes in one so .... My fortunes say : Answer just what your heart prompts you to . Watch your relations with other people carefully , be reserved . Your talents will be recognized and suitably rewarded . What are those supposed to mean ??? I've already asked < PROPMALE > and he had some good ideas .... 
bored .... stupid freaking homework !!!!! I was supposed to write one big acrostic poem using the word government and it was suposed to be about six other governments and instead i wrote six seperate ones on each type of government so now i'm way behind on everything .... 
It really hurts to think that people that used to be my best friends can come to one of my concerts and say that they're only coming to see Sunnni and totally forget about me . I mean , It's my favorite thing in the world and you couldn't even pretend just a little bit that you cared ? Thanks alot ... 
some things in life just don't turn out like you thought they would . That's the whole point of life ; to make changes and have adventures , even if they seem scary at first . That's what i'm doing right now , starting my scary adventure . :)

I am so happy that i have shows to watch now ! Ha ha . . . except maybe there aren't as many American Idols out there as we thought there were . There are some that are REALLLLLY good . Then there are some really BADDDDD ones too . I can't wait to be up there on that stage giving my all ... :D :D :D 
The only thing making me smile right now is the lyrics to Two is better than one . I love that song .... :) 
Ugh . I hate when life isn't working out . I hate when you can just tell that your life is gonna suck the next day . I hate when the same song that plays every time you hate your life comes on when youre writing this . >:( 
I'm listening to me and < PROPFEMALE>'s song . :'( :'( :'( I wish there were a solution ! ahh too many tears this new year of 2010 . Heres emilys part .... wahhhhh .... :'(

Tonite is family nite ! Yay ! Tonite we get to tear up the kitchen floor together ! What fun ! We're replacing it with hardwood ..... woohoo ! 
And you shall run and wander , and you shall dream and sing , of brave things and bright things beyond the swallows wings . And you shall envy no man , nor hurt your heart with sighs , for i will keep you simple , that god may make you wise ... I LOVE THAT SONG !!! It's called For a child and it's one of our chorus peices and it always , AlWaYs , ALWAYS , gets stuck in our heads for the rest of the day ... lol 
ALL OF THE GIRLS IN CHORUS NEED TO CHECK THEIR INBOXES AS SOON AS THEY CAN !!! THINGS WRITTEN IN THE LETTER NEED TO TAKE ACTION PRETTY DANG QUICKLY OR THERE'S GOING TO BE CONSEQUENCES !!!!!! NOT EVEN KIDDING !!! - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
Tearing up your kitchen floor is sooooooo much harder than you think !!!!!!!!!!!!! We found 4 different types of linoleum underneath of our top coat of linoleum in just the hallway and kitchen .... my dad and la vona are still at it ... they insist that they want to rip everything out tonight when im ready to pass out ... ugh ...

I am so jealous of < PROPFEMALE > ! She's so pretty !!! ugh , if u get a < PROPMALE > to do anything , check out her profile pictures .... gorgous photos ... gosh ... 
He knows i like him , but not how much ... ughhhhhh ... if only he knew ... maybe it would change things , maybe not ... idk . i don't think he'll ever know ... not unless i tell him ... ughhh 
I wish J.c. were still here . Just as a friend . I just need someone to talk to that's not a girl . I'm tired of talking to girls ... idk y though ... i just don't have any successful relationships with guys .... even if it is just a friendship ... ugh ... i miss u J.c. even if u did break up with me just because u were moving ... i don't care at this point ... 
I hate when you go back and look at what actually went on after a huge serving of drama and you realized , crap .... that could've been my fault , or it could've been their fault by lying to you , but you'll never know because you can't fix what u or they broke .... ugh ... i . hate . drama . 
I HATE MY LIFE !!! UGHHHHHHHH ..... :'( 
I HATE MY LIFE . 
If someone says trust me , do you ? If someone says believe me , will you ? If someone says i'm your shoulder to cry on , will you cry on their shoulder ? Will they really be there to lend you their shoulder ? Can you trust them ? And are you able to believe them ? Ask yourself these questions the next time you're getting to know someone ... 
i hate my life , i hate myself and i feel horrible on top of all that . i thought this whole time he had lied to me , when really it was all my fault .... i'm in a state of feeling sorry and hating myself ... i can't even talk to him to tell him all that ... not that it's going to change anything , cuz i know it's not , but if you're reading this , i'm sorry . i never even should've asked u how far u would go ... i'm sorry . 
EVERYONE'S MAD AT ME . I REALLY DON'T GIVE A CRAP IF THEY ARE OR AREN'T . I KNOW PART OF IT'S MY FAULT BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO GET UR NOSE OUT OF MY BUISNESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOSH ... YOU LEARNED THAT IN KINDERGARDEN ... THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH DRAMA AT OUR SCHOOL . ALL OF YOU PLAYERS NEED TO DROP WHATEVER REPUTATION YOU HAVE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED , NOONE CARES ABOUT IT !!!!!!!!!!!! STOP BREAKING GIRLS ' HEARTS !!!!!!!!!!! 
I'm gonna ask my parents if i can move back home to live with family . I didn't do anything and everybody's yelling at me accusing me of things i didn't do and calling me things i'm not . Right now considering that i'm crying because of drama , something needs to change . I'm sorry for all of you out there that don't want me to move . < PROPFEMALE > , you'll always be my sister and i need you to know that . I'll miss you chorus ! :'(

Too much to remember when it comes to plans and responsibilities . Too much to forget when it comes to memories , friends , and promises . You can't forget what's important to you . Don't let yourself .

CRY FOR YOU\ 
BY : SEPTEMBER\ 
Forever and ever , life is now or never , \ 
Forever never comes around , \ 
People love and let go , \ 
Forever's gonna slow you down , \ 
\ 
You'll never see me again , \ 
So now who's gonna cry for you ? \ 
No matter what you do . 
Watching the finale of So you think you can dance . So beautiful . :) \ 
Wear ALL black tommorow ? ALL ? 
School ... i hope i chose a good outfit ... lol . Learning ? not so much .... i don't wanna ! :( lol 
I stand still as you walk past me . I go to say \You can't quit\ " but nothing comes out . How could I think someone as gorgeous as you could like someone like me ? " 
Is it possible to be at the right place at the right time but the event that's supposed to happen doesn't because it's not supposed to ? What if it is supposed to but it just doesn't ? idk ... something to think about ... 
I'm confused . :'( <3 \ 
Every time I try to get what I want ... something else happens . Something unexpected . Like a slap in the face when u just wanted ice cream !!! :'( 
Happy . :) Hopefully this feeling will last longer than one night this time :/\ 
Please give me good cards god ...! :) 
Good night facebook . Please be a good day tommorow . :/ :P

Hey Facebook . Today was an ... interesting day . Not bad though ... just funny ... and surprising ... lol . Expecially since I had a bag of ice to my face the entire day . Whenever someone looked at me it's like they were thinking \Who the crap punched < PROPFEMALE > in the face ?! \ " But of course someone had to be sarcastic ... Bailey Vance : What'd you do ? Bite your lip ? Eh ... not really ... lol . " 
I'm so upset right now . I went to Sprint tonight ... got my phone fixed . Not even an hour later It gets completely screwed up and does the same thing that we had to have fixed . Now I have NO use of my phone ... where as before , I could at least text . >:| NO ME GUSTA < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . NO BUENO !!!!! URGGG 
Facebook ... my day was ... ok ... not amazing ... but tonight ... after cooling down about my phone ... it got better :)

Tonight ... wasn't one of our best concerts ... expecially since I messed up ... lol . cuz that never happens ... LIES . lol . 
SQUIRREL WITH A NUT !!!!! lol .... i <3 @ < PROPFEMALE > Collins . :P 
Hey . Cory ... u need to message me lol .... and if any other guy wants to talk to me ... that's fine . i am tired of talking to girls right now ... just saying ... no offense . 
I'm boreddd ... and kind of angry . I hate fighting with you , so let's please stop . 
church here i come ... lol :) bout to eat lunch . :D 
My phone is so annoying . I wish that Sprint just ordered me a new phone like they said they were gonna instead of deciding that it works ... which it does .... but it still messes up . It made me so upset that I cried this afternoon . I cried ! Talk about technology ruling our lives ........ ugh 
I don't want to think about how i got a little taste of my phone before it broke again . I wish someone would talk to me ... :( 
The person I was talking to got grounded ... so ... bye bye conversation . lol . I love Mikayla Bower though :) i'm here if anyone wants to talk to me . :D 
How is it that when something bad happens it all goes bad ? How come everytime you're single it seems like everyone is dating ....? lol 
For those of you who think I want or need more drama in my life , I really DON'T so back off and create your own drama don't dump it in my hands . Not everything is my fault okay ? So don't blame it on me either ! I'm tired of everybody getting in other people's buisness . Just quit it already ! It's not gonna make you any more popular than you think you are just by making another person's life miserable . 
No Air - Jordin Sparks & < PROPFIRST > Brown\ 
<3<3<3 I <3 this song . :) <3 
I've learned to live half alive ... <3 :'( 
Living empty-minded is as dangerous as living blind . Don't let things pass you by . It'll be the biggest mistake you make . You'll regret it 4ever . I promise . Take in every scent , image , moment & memory bcuz one day it'll be gone and you won't be able to get it back . Live life the fullest & nothin less . <3 the world ~ ur family ~ ur friends . They r the ones who matter . I <3 u Mikayla Bower & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Scoby . You're my rock 
I hope my crushes(the ones that talked to McCleskey Crushes ) talk to me soon ... maybe tell me they like me ? It doesn't matter ... lol . 
I'm so tired . I've been really busy lately ... and i have plans tonight too . ugh .. sleeeeeeeeeppp . :P 
The girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30 lbs . The boy you called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4 hrs a night . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying
