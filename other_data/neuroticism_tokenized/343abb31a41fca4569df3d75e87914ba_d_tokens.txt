Dobby is a free elf ! 
It's just a jump to the left\ 
And then a step to the right \

With your hands on your hips\ 
You bring your knees in tight 
Let me show you around , maybe play you a sound\ 
You look like you're both pretty groovy\ 
Or if you want something visual\ 
That's not too abysmal\ 
We could take in an old Steeve Reeves movie

Facebook Mobile : for when you're too obsessed to wait until you get home 
Not even an hour into break and already I'm so bored that I'm vacuuming . Sucks not having a computer . 
You make up excuses not to jog like that it's midnight and freezing cold , but admit it : you're just lazy . 
needs to find a more efficient way to waste time . 
was temporarily tricked into thinking it was Friday the 13th and faced the bitter disappointment of not getting to watch the movies as an aftermath . 
can now scratch off turtle from my list of animals I've never eaten .

Good night : four guys take off their pants and let you do their lipstick , eyeshadow , eyeliner , and masquera . Then you throw toast .
