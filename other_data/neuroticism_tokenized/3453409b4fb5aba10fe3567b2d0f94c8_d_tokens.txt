How dare you all confront my mother with my own words , if you have an issue , take it up with me , my mother doesn't play a apart in my way of thinking , I respect her , but I don't agree with her , that is something you should all learn . I denounce you as my family , don't ever speak to me again . I will fight for my rights as an American to state my opinion . 
Eye on the TV , cause tragedy thrills me , whatever flavor it happens to be , like , killed by the husband , drown by the ocean , shot by his own son , she used a poison in his tea , kissed him goodbye , that's my kind of story , its no fun ' til someone dies ...

Dead girls like me , Only dead girls dont walk away from me , sad as it seems . Have you ever tasted love like this ? Cool and smooth . And have you ever been accepted unconditionally ? And have you ever loved someone who didnt hurt you , didnt harm you ? Theres no pain and no pressure , overblown humiliation , theres no fear , theres no shame , theres no pulse , how is it so strange ? Dead girls like me , only dead girls like me . 
Good to be home ... I think .

They say there is no sin in killing a beast , there is only sin in killing a man ... but where does one begin and the other end ? Haha ... Wolfman was pretty good . 
And the hardest part , was letting go and not taking part ... 
“Those who hate most fervently must have once loved deeply ; those who want to deny the world must have once embraced what they now set on fire . ” -- Kurt Tucholsky 
“Those who hate most fervently must have once loved deeply ; those who want to deny the world must have once embraced what they now set on fire . ” already had this quote up , but it accurately represents me . 
I am free of all prejudices . I hate every one equally . \

Pretty funny how one day that starts off good can so easily be sent the opposite way . 
~ I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense , once hate is gone ... they will be forced to deal with pain . ~

And it's so easy when you're evil\ 
This is the life , you see\ 
The Devil tips his hat to me\ 
I do it all because I'm evil\ 
And I do it all for free\ 
Your tears are all the pay I'll ever need ... 
Say you want to stay you want me too\ 
Say you'll never die , you'll always haunt me\ 
I want to know I belong to you\ 
Say you'll haunt me
