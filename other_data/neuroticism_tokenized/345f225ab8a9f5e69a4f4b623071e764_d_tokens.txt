I comforted a lady in need < PROPFEMALE>'s in the lady's restroom .

Winter in Michigan finally has arrived . An unwelcome guest . ( As far as I'm concerned ) 
Didn't make it far from home , got stuck in a snow drift and had to dig my way out of it . Wouldn't have gone out if I didn't have a job interview that I already had to cancel once already and didn't really need a job . Had to shovel icy packed snow for an hour and a half w/ the help of Dad . Sore . Ugh , how do I hate the snow , let me count the ways !!! It's beautiful ... in pictures . 
Okay , if u don't have to go out driving today , why in the hell would you go out on the treacherous ice rinks we call roads ? I guess people like ice-skating toward uncertain death and destruction . Temps in the teens & single digits , hi winds , & snow = ice and ice = no traction , no matter what kind of vehicle u drive . 
Happy Elfie Day ! Where good children put out their shoes & the elves bring them goodies .

Anyone else watching the eclipse ? 
I'm racing against time . 
Not like any of u care , but I decided to change my job hunting strategy from just finding a job for sustenance in the meantime , since obviously that isn't working to try & find a good job . That's my big thought for the day , tomorrow is another day . 
I don't ask for much . 
Wishing everyone a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and a peaceful blessed year ! Laugh , Love , Live ! It's everyone's day to be a kid again ! Don't take things for granted , & count your blessings .

Get ready for what they said on the news could be the biggest snowstorm to hit our country . They said it is affecting 33 of the 50 states & showed the view of it from space . Glad we have a generator here , jic . Showed a hi of 9 & lo -2 for Thurs AND Fri . 
Okay , channel 7 just said this could be the biggest storm or snow storm in U.S. history , I'll believe it when I see it ! 
Well the wind here was bad , I know the gusts had to be at least 50 mph . The snow was flying sideways & it looked like a hurricane , & the wind was loud against the house like it was when we had that windstorm in the summer . That passed now , I just hear ice pelting the walkout door . The newsman said the wind has yet to arrive , I hope not , because I want to get some sleep tonite . 
For the weathermen & all the people talking about how much snow we've gotten this year , I have one word for them- 1978 .
