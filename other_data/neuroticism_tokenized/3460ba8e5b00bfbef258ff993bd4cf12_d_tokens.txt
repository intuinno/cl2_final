Man refused to adapt to his environment so he adapted his environment to suit him . He built cities , roads , vehicles , machinery , put out power lines to run his labor-saving devices . But , the more he improved things to make his life easier , the more complicated he made it . Now his children are sentenced to 10-15 yrs of school just to learn how to survive in this complex and hazardous habitat they were born into . 
Today , I filled my first car up with gas for the first time . I felt so proud !!! I know . . . what a loser . . . :P \ 
\ 
I sent you a smiley ! Want to see it ? http://apps.facebook.com/smileycentral/go.jhtml?partner=ZNzfb008 
paid in two days . . . . I wanna know who said it was OK to get paid only once a month !!! booooooooooo . . . 
woke up feeling hungover . . . snuffy nose , sore throat , cough . . . damn it ! I refuse to use any more of my days off feeling crummy ! Needless to say , I got attacked when I came to school by a swarm of concerned Japanese teachers . . . asking if my armpits were hot . . . 
So , I'm definitely missing a fish . Had 9 . Now there are 8 . One of the big ones ( there were only 2 big ones ) . No remains left in the tank . No sign that it flopped out and died . Nothing . No effing ANYTHING to tell me what happened to my poor little fishy ! Kinda creeps me out . . . 
I'm a little rough with my car , but I think she likes it ;) 
On the walk home , I've noticed the giant spiders have now become heaps of little spiders . . . then I got home and realized the same was going on in my house . . . congratulations , mama spiders ! If I'm feeling nice , I might let your children live ! MWAHAHAHAAAA ! 
my wrist still hurts from archery , bah . . . 
aaaaaaaaand they put me back in the mask . . .

No class until 2:30 and I'm stuck in this office with little to nothing to do until then because my Japanese co-teacher is a workaholic , as usual . . . BAH !!!

My elementary school's Vice Principal in singing in it and she's selling tickets . I told her I might go with some friends , so please let me know !

be sent to your 5 people sometime in 2011 . \ 
I'll try to make something good for you , haha . . . 
Two socks per foot , two pairs of tights , four skirts , four top layers and my giant gaijin feet just can't seem to stay warm over here ! Teachers gave students a ton of work to do over winter break and now students have half days so teachers have time to correct it all . . . I don't get to correct papers . Not much else to do but think about how cold my feet are . . . Well , at least it isn't snowing ! Happy 2011 ! :D 
probably the coolest vice-principal ever . . . just handed me a 2-3 liter jar of plum wine . . . SWEET !!! >_< free boozes from the boss man !

OK , knee - surgery scheduled for the 18th of Feb . A possible detatched/ torn ligament and medial cartilage damage that needs orthoscopic surgery . Too complicated now . Very minor , small cut , put to sleep during . Hospitalized from the 17th to 24th . Until then , crutches and booze are good friends . Thanks to < PROPFIRST > for putting up with shit through it all . Glad you could take care of me . . . <3 ??????? 
Don't be angry about < PROPFIRST>'s Day . . . just think about the people you love and the people that love you . . . WHOEVER that may be !!! <3

Fuck Japanese pain meds !

I have climbed mountains , hiked great big trails , ridden a horse , played with numerous martial arts and dances , repelled off of buildings , skydived . . . and taken a shower on two feet for the first time in a month .
