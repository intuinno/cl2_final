So , my 10 year old daughter found a very young kitten ( maybe a week old ) in our yard beside our big Black Lab last night . We have no idea where it's mother is so I guess it's up to us to nurse it for the next 6 weeks . Not sure how that will work when it needs to be fed every two hours . 
Well , my mother cat had her kittens yesterday . We grafted the lost kitten to her last night and she took it ! YAY !!! I can now sleep through the night not having to get up every two hours to feed it !

So they just passed a health care plan written by a committee whose chairman says he didn't understand it , passed by a Congress that exempts themselves from it , signed by a president who smokes , with funding administered by a treasury chief who didn't pay his taxes , all to be overseen by a surgeon general who is obese ,...... and better yet it is to be financed by a country that's broke .

It begins and ends with money . It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education , health , for people , that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film . It's obscene . < PROPFEMALE > Turner 
I know each fund has its supporters , and that some will not want to see the surplus go to schools . But , in tough times , you have to set priorities . And our priority is education . < PROPMALE > Blagojevich 
The purpose of education is to keep a culture from being drowned in senseless repetitions , each of which claims to offer a new insight . < PROPFIRST > Rosenberg 
Education is the great engine of personal development . It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor , that a son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine , that a child of farm workers can become the president ... < PROPMALE > Mandela 
Improving public education is a patriotic act . There’s no better way to perpetuate a strong , safe , prosperous < PROPFEMALE > than by providing her children with the education needed to keep her that way . < PROPFEMALE > Pampuch

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding herhow wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her .

My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores , go to church & school . They gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job and work for the things that I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school , at my job & to take pride in my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic & respect for the law , and my elders . I thank God everyday for my parents . Copy and paste if you had Mean parents too ! 
IT IS TOO DAMN COLD OUT THERE !!!!!!!!

~ An old man once said ... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living . ~ 
Amazing Race ! Yay ! :) \\n 
Wishing and waiting for SUMMER !!!!!!!

? If your Dad is a hard working man and is and always will be your hero , helped you no matter how bad you were or was just the BEST DAD EVER , if you are blessed to still have your DAD or if he is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are PROUD of your Dad . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one DAD . ? 
In life , we do things . Some we wish we had never done and some we wish we could replay a million times . But they all make us who we are and in the end they shape and detail us . If we were to reverse them , we wouldn't be the person we are today . So just live , make mistakes and have wonderful memories . But never second guess who you are , where you've been and most importantly , where your going . 
I am looking for some size 2 wrestling shoes that are in decent shape .

At Breeze's last basketball tournament . 
At the request of a facebook friend-we are asking everyone to say a prayer for the US \Darkhorse\ " 3rd Battalion 5th Marines and their families . They are fighting it out in Afghanistan and have lost 9 Marines in 4 days . IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE IT ON EVERYONE'S PAGE ... Even if it's only for an hour . Come on guys show your support ! I am HONORED to re-post this ! Thank you to ALL of OUR service men and women " 
Wow ! 6:00 and still looks like 4:00 . Love it ! :) 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
Happy Birthday Daddy !!! I love you and miss you so much !!!!!!!!

Do what’s right . . . even if you are afraid . \ 
Listen to the inner wisdom of your soul . . . and not the random opinions of others . \ 
Be kind . . . and remember that sometimes the person you need to be kindest to is yourself . \ 
Live by choice . . . not chance . \ 
... Be fair and treat all people with respect , and understand their point of view e ... ven if you don’t agree with it . 
Had a nice day out with good friends and NO kids . :) \\nCobra
