Sunday < PROPFIRST > 2nd .... still no internet at home - we get re-connected tomorrow . 

is anyone else experiencing really weird happenings with facebook in the last 2 days ?? deleted accounts , missing friends , ????? 
the day was < PROPFEMALE > . my daughter moved away . my great aunt died . and so it was . 
so it seems the true problem with my facebook account was the photo of the religious guy holding up the sign that said \G*d hates f @gs \ " with the other guy holding up the sign that said \ " f*ck this guy\ " ... someone made a complaint about it . whoever it was - i hope i haven't \ " re-friended\ " them already . " 
grrrr ... still can't find some of the people i am looking for ...
