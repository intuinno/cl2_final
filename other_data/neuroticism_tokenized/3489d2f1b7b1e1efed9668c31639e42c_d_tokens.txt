Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training . They do it to get a crown that will not last , but we do it to get a crown that will last forever . Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly ; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air . No , I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified for the prize . 1 Corinthians 9:25 -27
