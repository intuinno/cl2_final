LGHS Class of ' 79 -- What an amazing , beautiful group ... Totally felt the love !!! I'm not even sad that the reunion is over ...

I so look forward to deepening new and old friendships ... Lots of love to all of you !!!

It would be hypocritical of me to somehow suddenly turn nationalistic and root for the US . And pointless . But I can't bring myself to root for England . So I'll just root for a good game . 
N Korea is playing really well . Is that because if they lose they get executed ?

So I dug out all my roommate's beer bottles , and whatever else I could find , and took it to the local recycling center . An hour later , I was $6.88 richer . That was SO unsatisfying ! 
I <3 MY SISTER !!!! Whoooot !!!!! 
If con is the opposite of pro , is Congress the opposite of progress ? \
