Ignorance is apparent when the obvious is doubted . 
< PROPFIRST > game <3 DO IT ! :D 
43 : You don't like me very much , and I think that's silly because I've never done anything to you . You're a really cool , entertaining person , and you seem like you'd be a lot of fun , but you're extremely rude to me , at least via Facebook , and I think that's pretty lame . 
Drama Club Christmas Party today ! Yay ! (: 
Yep . That's right . I'm a Christmas Tree . (: 
All I want for Christmas is you . </3 
Tell me something baby , do I creep you out ? Give you chills , make you ill , and freak you out ?
