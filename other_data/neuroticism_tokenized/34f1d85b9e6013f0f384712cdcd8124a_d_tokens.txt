God commands us to Love others , even those who may not deserve it ..... It's easy to Love who you want to Love , but God wants to see us Love those who make it hard for us to love .

I am so tired of hearing some of our Black women complain about our Black men pursuing relationships with white women . SO WHAT !!!! Apparently he wasnt meant for you . If you have trust and a relationship with God- He has your man waiting for you when you're ready . Stop blaming folks . Some of us arent even treating our good black men right anyway-and some black men arent treating any woman right-black or white .

Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love Never Fails- 1Corinthians 13:4 -8 .

Someone just asked me what is my biggest pet peeve ; When people buy , watch , sell , bootleg movies !!! Someone steals the movie and sells it for $5 .

The weather is great , so if you can , get out there ( or anywhere ) and Get It ! 
Can your parents really decrease your future job opportunities because of the name they give you ? Names such as Empire , JayDevonte , Shanaqualeesha , D'Nautica , Tarajuana , Sasshay , Amillion , etc ., etc . I have to wonder if in today's job market and society , would an employer completely overlook an application/resume because of the name . Should parents be more thoughtful in naming their children ?

Let your conversation be always full of grace , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how to answer everyone . -Colossians 4:6 ( NIV ) . Since this way of responding is best for us , God not only requires it but also empowers us to speak with grace about all people . As we do so , God replaces our hatred with love . 
Love wholeheartedly , have a joyful heart , and always give God Thanks and Praise . 
When it comes to others who may not be doing what we think they should be doing , or even what God may expect them to be doing ; in order for us to do God's will , we have to get out of the judgement seat and into the witness stand .

“Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting . And let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not , ” ( Galatians 6:7 -9 . ) 
One cannot sow deception and reap confidence , sow sparingly and reap bountifully , sow bad habits and reap good character , sow seeds of cruelty and reap a harvest of mercy .
