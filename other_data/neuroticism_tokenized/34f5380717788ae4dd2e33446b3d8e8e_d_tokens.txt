So much is changing ... 
Its my rebirthday :) 
I wish I were back in the bath with obama and geronimo . ????

Its finally over , thank goodness . 
awesome storm . awesome God . 
hopes hairy yellow and black spiders do not visit MollyDreamWorld tonight . 
can't stop smiling ;) 
Why are you trying to earn grace ? Why are you looking for love ? Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough ? 
has a very active imagination . 
what a night : awesome swings , castle with girl pow-wow , subway , ukraine ... 
it is 4:00 am . I am still awake . I have yet to finish packing . Oh procrastination . 
is finally in Searcy with many conflicting feelings . 
Did everyone just see me change in front of my open window ? I think yes . how grand . 
Almost didn't wake up this morning , almost burned my scalp with a straightener , almost couldn't find my class , almost didn't get the memo about a cast meeting , almost walked into a pole at walmart ... this has been almost the worst 24 hours ever .... 
pitchas ! 
thank youuuu .... awkward cable people . 
Oh what a beautiful mooooorning .... this is a line from the musical that sports the same name as the place I will be tonight . :) 
' s teeth are chattering . 
is definitely a freak . 
would like to respectfully ask Jesus to come back today , please . 
His mercies are new every morning . 
Oh my goodness . seventy percent of the statuses on my homepage have to do with football . this is ridiculous . 
Pizza + P90X + sparkling grape juice + friends = one awesome night in the suite ;) 
It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society . -Krishnamurti

Thank you everyone !! 20th birthday = a success ! 
loves her suitemate < PROPFEMALE > with all of her heart . <3 
Is never going to leave < PROPFEMALE > Cascio or < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > alone with her computer ever again ! 
feels like banging her phone against the concrete wall until it agrees to get texts again !! 
just loves hearing about how tired she looks . 
loves the smell of elephants at circuses . 
It is you , Lord , who knows my weakness ; You refine me with your own hand . 
Dear Fall Break , HURRY UP ! Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > ;) 
these are a few of my favorite things : Nasty cold wet days , unexplainable headaches , four hour rehearsals that in reality never end , and possibly broken toes . Oh wait , did i say favorite ? I meant MOST HATED EVER . 
is pretty much a wreck ... 
just completely missed the chair . it hurt a lot . 
Because your love is better than life , my lips will glorify you . Psalm 63:3 
???! :) 
Getting up is so much harder the second time .... 
WE are the links of this < PROPFEMALE > Gamma chain ! 
FINALLY over . DGR = love ;) 
ALL the vain things that charm me most , I sacrifice them to His blood . 
He is so faithful . 
I have so many thoughts about Transformers 2 , I can't even pick the wittiest one to put as my status . 
I had a very vivid dream that I woke up on time . Imagine my surprise to find out I actually didn't .... 
oklahoma tomorrow ! :) 
too many oreos + some awesome stolen glass-less glasses + no more rehearsal = SATISFACTION . 
needs a nap , a massage , and some motivation . Just like pretty much everyone else on campus . 
Its morphin time !!! 
New beaux ! I'm so happy for < PROPMALE > Caudill and < PROPFIRST > White !! Congratulations guys :) 
worst morning ever . but since I'll be sleeping in my own bed tonight , I think I can handle it . :) 
Why yes , I DID just wake up after a marvelous 13 hours of sleep . Thank you for asking . 
Jesus , can you show me just how far the east is from the west ? 
college football = more trouble than its worth 
A great club full of boys singing choreographed carols beneath my window ? Yes , please . LOVE < PROPFIRST > sigs ! 
My scissors just moved of their own volition . 
< PROPFEMALE > , please . 
< PROPFIRST > Revere was a dentist ? 
I am ... eating whipped cream with a spoon . Healthiest choice ever . 
Quelf is a good idea . 
After a taxing day full of grumpy secretaries , lame music , cosmic brownies , and small hyperactive dogs .... I am home . :) 
I never leave Your hands . 
My love I will keep you , by My pow'r alone . I don't care where you fall , where you have been . I'll never forsake you , My love never ends . It never ends . 
Talking and I are BFFs again . This is a glorious occurrence . 
ONE WEEK . I think I can make it . 
He reigns . Always . 
I am refraining to stave off jealousy ;) 
Hold the phone . I came back to Searcy to go to CLASS ? I don't remember signing up for this . 
I have dyed my hurr .... without the help of koolaid . 
Just so everyone knows ... my phone is on the blink . No texting or telephonically communicating for me ! 
' s phone is working again . praise . 
Vote for Love without Boundaries !! 
Dear throat , It would be supremely excellent if you stopped making me feel like death all the time . I know this might be tough for you , but I'd also like to be able to talk and eat once in awhile . Kthanks , < PROPFEMALE > P.S. I'd really appreciate it if you didn't have mono . 
I can't remember the last time I was sick this long . Its exhausting . 
therapy is about to happen . 
Home ! 
Edge of darkness = not worth it . 
Raindrops keep fallin on my head . 
I went to ALL my classes today :) 
WHY AM I STILL ON THIS BLASTED WEBSITE ? 
Apologies for any impersonations that may have occurred this evening . I accidentally left chat online ! 
Sunshine ! Happy ! <3 
I'm going to find the jerk who gave me stomach flu , steal away into his home on a dark cold night , and punch him in the face . after I buy him a kitten . 
Shake off your dust ; rise up , sit enthroned , O Jerusalem . Free yourself from the chains on your neck , O captive Daughter of Zion . < PROPMALE > 52:2 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > McCanless for making my night the best ! < PROPFIRST > Sig dodgeball = <3 ..... even though I'm horrible at it . 
I vote sleeping instead of classes ! In fact , lets just create a new holiday : International Nap Day . 
Is it just me , or has this been the LONGEST WEEK EVER ?? 
I haven't really been satisfied with the Oscars since Return of the < PROPMALE > swept everything . This year was yet again rife with disappointment . 
Okay . Lets pretend I'm productive and then see how this day goes . 
Are there any other high schools as BALLIN as < PROPMALE > Memorial ??? I don't think so . I mean , $ 527,000 ? Seriously ? 
I want to change the world , instead I sleep . I want to believe in more than you and me . But all that I know is I'm breathing ; all I can do is keep breathing now . - < PROPFEMALE > <3 
I'm exhausted . I have no reason to be up late . I don't even WANT to be awake . and yet here I am . 
And I'm just as confused as ever . But I have so much faith that it'll be okay ... eventually ! 
\I want a mixed baby SO bad . You don't even know . \"" 
This makes me SO happy . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gAxbxxmYZ8&feature=related 
I'll be looking at the < PROPFEMALE > , but I'll be seeing you . 
To my loathsome and girly feelings : I regret to inform you that I can no longer put up with your presence . It is impossible have you in my life and expect to get anything done . Therefore I am kicking you out until further notice . Give my regards to the next overdramatic life-form you infect . Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Adrenaline wearing off . 
Motivation = cero porcentaje . entonces .... 
\Guys ... I just realized I can put < PROPFEMALE > Gamma Rho as one of my interests on facebook .... Best day ever . \"" 
I wish I was on my way to Oklahoma right now ... but I'm going to make the safe choice and enjoy a teensy nap before I go so that I can drive six hours and not die . 
I am SO EXCITED to be a < PROPFIRST > SIG < PROPFEMALE > !!!! Bless . 
Congratulations < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !! <3 
Swimming through sick lullabies .... 
I'm awake at 5:30 on a Monday morning : this is a very rare accomplishment . The trick , I've found , is not to fall asleep in the first place . 
Glad and sad to be done with clinic ... my client was so precious ! 
time to crawl in a hole . 
Dear Spring sing 2011 .... Get ready for < PROPFEMALE > Gamma Rho to ROCK IT . 
I . AM . SO . EXCITED . 
I should probably get some sleep ........ Nah . Its college ! 
I'm done done done done done with my first semester of clinicals !!! And look , no serious injuries ! 
Scandalous activities = SUCCESS ! 
I am officially set to go to Peru !!! My Jesus never ceases to amaze me . 
I smell of sunscreen , lake water , and a wonderful happy day :) 
Welp . I made it home . What do I do now ?? \ 
\ 
... Answer : Laze around , stay up too late , have an earlier curfew and be bored a lot . * sigh * 
I'm in < PROPMALE > . Text me and lets < PROPFEMALE > out . 
A giant moth just landed on my favorite porcelain doll in my room . I am FREAKING . OUT . It is GINORMOUS . 
I am seriously considering pulling an all-nighter cause I'm just too worked up to sleep . But I think I need to get a little shut-eye .... cause I'll be in LIMA later today !!!!! 
After a great deal of hassle , I have made it to the airport gate and am using my complimentary 20 minutes of internet ... I leave for Peru in ONE HOUR . :D \ 
I would say goodbye to everyone , but its likely I'll have internet most of the time while I'm there . P.S. If your name is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , you should install Skype :) <3 
made it safely ;) 
Oh the bidet . Not brave enough to try it . 
After being robbed of a morning run , I headed back to my warm bed , only to be reawakened shortly after by a JACKHAMMER outside my window . Seriously . 
Spirituality is anything but a straight line ; it is a mixed-up , topsy-turvy , helter-skelter Godliness that turns our lives into an upside-down toboggan ride full of unexpected turns , surprise bumps , and bone-shattering crashes . In other words , messy spirituality is the delirious consequence of a life invaded by a Jesus who will love us right into His arms . - < PROPFIRST > Yaconelli , \Messy Spirituality \"" 
I . JUST . WATCHED . THE GREY'S FINALE . I'm shaking so badly I can't even think . 
I'm praying praying praying for better health and a better attitude . 
Our room has gone downhill fast . First it was only the lights in the bathroom , then the water in the shower went to igloo temperature , and now we don't have electricity at ALL , and our toilet's clogged and the man with the jackhammer and the rest of the large construction equipment will not SHUT UP . 
Jesus seriously fixed everything in our room today . It was all better by the time we got back to the hotel ! And we are more than ecstatic about it . \ 
P.S. The maintenance man's name is literally Jesus . 
I'm a lemming and we have a lot of free time in the mornings . www.formspring.me/mbrooks3 
I just popped my own finger back into place ! It hurt and was gross but now it feels a million times better . 
Went to the zoo , saw some lions mating , overcame a migraine . A productive day all things considered . 
I have the makings of a professional insomniac ; my valiant effort to fall asleep has been thwarted once again . Bejeweled therapy ? I think yes . 
Blood ..... NOT funny ! 
I won't lie . I cried like a baby when I said goodbye to my Peruvian family just now . I love you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Espinoza , Mikhail < PROPFIRST > Bonafón Epiquen , < PROPMALE > Onofre , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Tudela Galli , < PROPMALE > Ingunza , < PROPFEMALE > Onofre ! Gracias por todo , cuidense y nos vemos pronto ! 
I'm home ! And figuring out a new phone .... It would help me immensely if you texted me with your name so I don't have to enter all my contacts by hand ! 
But he was pierced for our transgressions . He was crushed for our iniquities . The punishment that brought our peace was on him ; and by his wounds we are healed . ( < PROPMALE > 53:5 WEB ) 
The problem with listening to an old playlist is the memories that are dredged up . 
Fireworks tonight ! Best ever ! 6 year old Jakey , clad only in shorts and bug spray , sat on my lap and made me cover his ears while he covered his eyes because the fireworks were too bright and too loud ... Needless to say , I don't think he got the full experience . 
Hey you .... call me if you're in < PROPMALE > . :D 
Too many people are getting engaged/married/happy . That's all there is to it . I'm done with this . 
Looking at GRE registration and it just hit me that I'm graduating . I'm GRADUATING IN ONE YEAR . From college . Whoa . 
They're coming out with a Say Yes to the Dress : Atlanta ; I would be lying if I said I wasn't excited . 
God must really think I need to work on my < PROPFEMALE > . 
If a < PROPFEMALE > popped up and gave me 3 wishes right now , the first thing I would wish is to duplicate myself ( and my car ) 5 times so I could take roadtrips to Memphis , Conway , Nashville , pretty much the entire state of Texas , and Florida ; that way I could see all my beautiful friends that I miss . 
After a surprising turn of events , this lifelong coffee-hater has been converted . 
I watch the ships go sailing by , if I play the girl will you play the guy ? And I never thought I would be the type to fall overboard just so you can catch me . - < PROPFEMALE > 
New dress . Check it . I'm thinking ... formal ? \

Plans ruined : check . No sleep : check . Sore throat : check . Bad start to the day : double check . 
Beauty and the Beast . Fave . 
Ow . 
This time next week I'll be in Searcy ! :) <3 
Smiling's my favorite ! 
Oh this is going to be a looong day :) :) 
Can someone PLEASE explain the male fascination with watching and then RE-watching sports games ? I don't think I'll ever understand . 
I'm in Searcy ! And I want to see you if you're here :) 
Someone stole the half of my brain that was supposed to remember my phone charger . Facebook me if you need me . :( 
I saw < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !!! And < PROPFEMALE > Mancera finally moved in !! My life is nearly complete . 
Juno and then Enchanted ? This channel knows me too well . 
Thank you , < PROPFIRST > Sigma < PROPFEMALE > , for ending my hectic day on an awesome note ! I love and have missed you all !!!! 
I need something else explained to me : the male habit of leg bouncing . In church , in class , in chapel , in everyday life .... why does one leg almost constantly bounce ? 
I absolutely adore my obnoxiously fantastic suitemates < PROPFEMALE > Duncomb and < PROPFEMALE > Mancera . Also my precious roomie < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and almost-roomie < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > McCoy . I could not make it through this year without these incredible girls . I love you ! 
I just want to cry . 
< PROPFEMALE > , young grasshopper . 
Praying for < PROPFEMALE > DeLaughter and family . Love you , girl . 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? Cause I'd wish for a 30 hour day and spend those extra six hours sleeping . Is that cool ? 
There's no frustration a good run can't fix . :) 
Then sings my soul ... 
Things they should sell in the student center : cereals that are comprised of more than sugar and cancer , a fast-pass that gets you to the front of the chicken biscuit line , and motivation . 
I have a love/ate relationship with food . 
I confess . It made me smile . 
I cannot describe how much I love < PROPFIRST > Sigma < PROPFEMALE > ! They make literally EVERYTHING better . 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWI6G5QnqQ - < PROPFIRST > ! 
I'm about to submit my request to GRADUATE . From college . Is this real life ?! 
I'm spending my last 25 minutes as a 20 yr old trapped behind the desk alone . Perf . 
Thank you so much for the birthday wishes !! I love you all !! 
Just so everyone is clear and the record is set straight , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is my favorite person in the world , and I think she looks very appropriate for her age . 
Home <3 
Life at best is bittersweet . 
If you're reading this , I probably love you . <3 
I love ???. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE . :) 
Anyone have GRE advice ? I'm taking it tomorrow and freaking out a little . \ 
... Okay , a lot . 
Should I feel accomplished now ? Whatever , it's over ! I'm done ! Praise . 
You're the hope in the morning\ 
You're the light when the night is falling\ 
You're the song when my heart is singing\ 
It's Your love . 
So many emotions . I am a lucky girl who has incredible friends . 
Opened up the My Pictures file this morning on a whim . So many old memories ! Whats up , nostalgia ? 
I have no idea how to write a career goal statement for these silly grad school apps . Can I just write a nice analysis of some rhetoric or something ? 
If you came and visited me this weekend , good job ! If you didn't .... good luck finding me the rest of the week . 
I . HATE . MONDAYS . \ 
So much . \ 
I'm just gonna go live in a shack in < PROPFEMALE > and play with orphan Mongolian babies . \ 
Can I do that ? 
I miss my sister . < PROPFEMALE > Brooks .... Come to searcy , plz . kthanksbye . 
The key to a great run is great music . 
Watching Kenzie , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > is the highlight of my week ! 
Best Skype convo ever . Polygamists , apple butter , nakedness , racism .... and so much more . < PROPMALE > Gavura , < PROPMALE > Graefe , < PROPMALE > West , < PROPMALE > ' Guish ' Anguish , < PROPMALE > Sheppard : I love you all . 
I may be wearing no makeup and sweatpants , but I started the day with prayer and that's the best preparation . DGR = <3 
Please join me in putting this in your status if you or your loved ones have been eaten by velociraptors . It's time to let silent victims everywhere know that there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for vicious sport . Velociraptors are , after all , kind of ... well ... unstoppable . 93% won't copy and paste this , but even the 7% that do can make a difference ! 
Ride this train . <3 
Thank you , < PROPFIRST > Sig pledges , for all the sweet notes and gifts ! I love you all ! 
Would like everyone to know that Billie-Marie < PROPFEMALE > is the BEST little sister EVER !! And I'm so glad she and all the other links are finally a part of < PROPFEMALE > GAMMA RHO !!! <3 \ 
X ? A boys : I am SO happy for you all as well ! Congratulations ! LOVE YOU :) 
Attention : this time tomorrow , the entire < PROPMALE > clan will be gracing Harding with its presence . Searcians , prepare yourselves . 
I just heard a rude boy whistling at me from across campus so I turned around indignantly to see that it was in fact , only a fat little bird . 
Forget nectar and ambrosia ; macaroni and cheese is the food of the gods . 
I might have stayed up til 5:30 am , but this afternoon nap and the thought of a completed paper are going to make it all worth it . SO worth it . 
Football function was successful . Thanks to < PROPMALE > Yaeger for being such a legit date ! Go TEAM ! 
I've said I wasn't going to try out for ensemble for weeks .... And as of tonight I've started to reconsider . I need to take a poll . Anyone have an opinion on the matter ? 
Favorite quote of the day : \Is it SNOWING ?? Oh my gash ! \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Eatherton upon walking into a small flock of gnats . " 
GOT APPROVED TO GRADUATE . Finally ! 
I made it home and had a girl's night with Hope < PROPMALE > ! Pumpkin spice frappucino and HP7 . Best night ever ! ( Also best mom ever ! ) 
I have some pretty incredible friends . 
And the Lord said , Let there be feasting . And he saw that it was good . 
My black Friday shopping expedition was a < PROPMALE > success . Thanks , Team . 
BOOMER SOONER ! 
I'm probably gonna kill the next person who crosses me . SERIOUSLY . 
Owe no one anything , except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law . ( Romans 13:8 WEB ) 
I need a bible class mext semester . Suggestions ?? 
So happy . 
What's up , project we got 6 weeks ago that's due tomorrow ? It's about time I started to work on you . Don't hate , procrastinate ! 
Everyone should be proud of my productivity today . I went ( on time ) to every class and stayed awake in all of them . AND I finished my project an hour early AND aced a Bible test . All on 3.5 hours sleep . 
Guys . Don't ever save your work to a library computer instead of a flash drive or email like a normal person . Inevitably you end up waiting an hour and a half on a girl writing a paper entitled \Sinks : More than just basic white . \ " to log off so you can find it . I mean I'm just saying . Not like I'm speaking from experience . " 
I am allergic to all this conflict and < PROPFEMALE > vu . :( 
Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > .... 
When did I become an adult ?!?! 
I'm just so glad to be home . 
19 days . 
At least my broken arm gives me an excuse to procrastinate even further the writing of my career goal statement . One-handed typing sucks ! 
Giving is the best present I could've received . 
Things recently added to the bucket list : Play Laser Tag , ice skate successfully , and own a baby panda . 
I need a good book . Recommendations ? 
I just sneezed eight times . Oh ... nine . < PROPFIRST > Shade Lawson < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > McCoy < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Wright 
Today grad school has become infinitely more real . This is happening . 
Is it too late to transfer ? 
Dear Searcy , I will forgive you for being so cold lately if you'll just hold on to a good amount of snow . Preferably on the roads so no one can make it to class . Also if you could stop being lame while you're at it , that'd be great . KThanks 
Spring Sing practice tonight ! Benson , 6pm ! Be there ! 
Someone give me something to do to keep me awake at the desk ... I think sleeping here is frowned upon . 
The best day to start my way , a convo with our excellent beaux < PROPMALE > Dowler and < PROPFIRST > McKee . 
Once again , < PROPFIRST > Sigs made my night awesome ! Especially < PROPMALE > Alumbaugh , < PROPFIRST > Mills , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Eatherton and < PROPFIRST > Norwood ! 
I'm not praying for snow tomorrow .... I'm praying for ICE ! 
Trying hard to speak and fighting with my weak hand ; Driven to distraction , so part of the plan .... I know something is broken and I'm trying to fix it ; Trying to repair it , any way I can . 
Things I love : < PROPMALE > , sunshine , being greeted by my sweet puppy , and the look of surprise on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>' face when I walked in the door . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Poe is the BEST for bringing me a sonic drink during my long stint at the desk ! 
The SIX HOUR nap I took this evening was totally worth it . No lie . 
Just got my first acceptance letter from one of my grad schools !!!! COULD NOT BE FREAKING OUT MORE . 
Confession : I get way too into the Bachelor . It's a legitimate problem . 
Praying for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and family . 
It's 1:15 am and I've got a thousand things left to do . Stay up all night and drive on lots of coffee ? Or aim to get a little sleep ? Decisions , decisions . Either way , I'll be in Oklahoma TODAY ! 
is officially a Sooner ! Master of Arts graduate class of 2013 !!!! 
I just bought the Insanity DVDs . Go ahead , judge me . 
If you're in the ???, ???, ZPZ , and Friends Spring Sing 2011 show you have music practice with DR JONES TOMORROW in the Reynolds building at 7:30 . Everyone MUST come , and PLEASE do not be late ! 
HATES < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > McCoy for her profile pic treachery ! 
To the elephants who live upstairs and interrupt my dean-mandated sleep : Go back to the zoo and live in the stinky pachyderm enclosure where you belong . KThanks
