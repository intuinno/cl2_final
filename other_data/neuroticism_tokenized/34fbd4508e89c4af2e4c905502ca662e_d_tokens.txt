Me : I like kittens better when they're not dead . \ 
Mom : They are more playful that way . 
Game 4 of 4 of this very long , but very well spent work day . Been here almost 10 hours , still counting . If you're interested in boys basketball state final action , tune it to Q 106.3 . :) 
Beware the Ides of March . 
Good luck today PSF ! 
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood . 
My time at MVTHS may be done , but our community is in desperate need of a new school and , if voted through , would be an asset to the development of Mt . < PROPFIRST > . Please , for the sake of future generations , vote yes on April 5 . 
Thanks to Connor < PROPMALE > for the best year ever :) I love you ! 
I would just really like some cake right about now . 
It's Friday ... We so excited . 
A long day of radio today ; board opped 8-10 a.m. for SMTS on Q106 , and I've been covering Final Four on WMIX AM 940 since 2 p.m. But I wouldn't trade this job for the worlddd . The Spirit of Radio lives in me ;) 
How low can I keep pretending to be ? That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me . Heaven will open up if I live on my knees ; a man of many words but a man of few deeds .
