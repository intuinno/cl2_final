\Studies show : Intelligent girls are more depressed Because they know What the world is really like .

\Don't go around saying the world owes you a living . The world owes you nothing . It was here first . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Twain ( 1835-1910 ) " 
What do you think living is the most like ? Like being a stone at the bottom of a moving stream , or like looking up to watch the snow fall ? 
A thought : What do you think the real purpsose of celebrating someone's bithday is ? An excuse to have a party ? Or simpily confirmation that the person has survived for a given period of time ? 
The past may determine what we are , may influence how we get to a certain point in our lives—but our futures , our decisions are ours alone . 
Grace is beauty . And even if it's not bright , no one will deny the grace of a born < PROPMALE > . - Just a thought while watching Animal Planet . :/ 
Finding a pattern to the world is fine and good , but expecting it to hold is ridiculous . Existence is chaos . Patterns form and stand only to break . 
I want to become someone who can learn to care for \ 
and love others . Who isn't afraid to open my heart and possibly get \ 
hurt . But first I must learn to care for and love myself .

\A laundry list of problems doesn't make you interesting . Never getting help doesn't make you brave . Not listening to reason doesn't mean that you have faith . You're just cutting off your nose to spite your face ! \"" 
\Sing me something soft ... Sad and delicate ... Or loud and out of key ... Sing me anything ... \""
