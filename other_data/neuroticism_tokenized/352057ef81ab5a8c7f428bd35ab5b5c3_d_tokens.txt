Thought i'd check in before checking out for the night , especially since i'm OFF tomorrow . Not that i don't relish my monday work schedule , cause i do . but a break from the norm is a break just the same . and shakin things up a little bit never hurts ! 

Okay weird day , kept thinking it was wednesday . so i'm already ready for tomorrow - strange , huh ? must be time for sleep ! 
Getting ready to do the diner thing ...... 
Oh yeah , i'm here , and it must be quiz night , again .

checking in - checking out . a few quizzes and i'm good to go ! 
My mind is distraught . How can you have a child that is so totally unappreciative , ungrateful and so totally lacking in common decency ? Really ready to give up ! Not sure where to go from here ! 
Yes , taking the next bus outta here cause i can . And just so everyone knows , i'm not getting my license back so that i can drive a teenager around for what ? not the cause , not the purpose . either she gets a grip on her life , or she takes it somewhere e 
peace out ! 
Okay , i checked in , passed out some drinks ( while i was having my own - i like to share ) , and i'm checking out . no quizzes tonight . long day tomorrow . 
Finally home , long day , business was good !

It's my day off and i have a cold . It's the type of cold that's easier to work with than be at home with . miserable , needless to say . 
My mind is blank that's all just blank ! 
Good one Sis ! And yet i'm still dazed and confused ! So i'm off to the one place i think most clearly . At the diner til further notice ... 
is looking forward to a day off tomorrow , i get to sleep in , yay ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes ! Yes i am celebrating , but i still refuse to open the mail from AARP ! Getting ready to grab my cue and run . Already got lei'd by < PROPFIRST > , what else do i need ? my mini-me is strapped to the post at the diner so that i can't fall over , i'm good to go !

guess it was quiz night ... i'm done for now ... 
I just wanna know how come i've got almost all my family here and my niece that deleted me is the only one to call me to let me know that my sister is in the hospital and not doing well ... what is up with that ? Are you guys there ... or what ?? 
How come it seems that even though family should be sacred ... no matter what ... it doesn't quite seem that way ? 
I'm very disappointed ... in all my family ... i am ! 
Okay , an update for my uninformed family ... Dawn is not doing well ... her heartbeat is finally coming down from the 151 that it was at ... her sugar still isn't good ... the blood coming from the tube isn't coming from her lungs ... or she'd be dead ... they're still not sure where it's coming from ... she's not coherent , but < PROPFEMALE > thinks she saw head movement ... and yes , < PROPMALE > is not there but < PROPFIRST > is 
< PROPFEMALE > is still critical ... she is holding her own at the moment ... the bleeding has stopped and they're bringing her sugar down as gradual as possible ... her ammonia and acid levels are still really high ( like off the charts ) and they're trying to understand why ... she's not in a coma but comatose ... there is body movement but no acknowledgement ... my sister < PROPFEMALE > is there which can only help her ... we're still praying ! 
< PROPFEMALE > convinced Mom to break the rules so that she could talk to me ... she was quite coherent and assured me that she's not giving up the fight ... they let her have a little ice cream and her diet coke and then she ate some dinner ... they've removed all restraints and with assistance is going to the bathroom ... yay ! The power of prayer ! I love her and I love you all ! <3 
Talked to Mom ... they're looking for a bed downstairs to move her to ... she's content to stay til they let her go ... Brenda fixed her hair for her and she looks much better ... she's eating and taking herself to the bathroom ... you can call her directly : 703-664-8602 and please do ! <3 
Just confirmed my flights and hotel ... ready to go ! 
Happy 4th everyone !!! 
guess it was quiz night ... 
child is sleeping ... ( yay ) ... out to play some pool !

Put this as your status if you're AGAINST bullies !!!
