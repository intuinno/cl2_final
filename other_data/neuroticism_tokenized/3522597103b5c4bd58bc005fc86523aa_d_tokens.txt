Okay so my Warhammer Army's backstory is gonna be that their planet has defected from the Imperium ( because I'm not the biggest fan of the Emperor or the morals of the Imperium to keep him going ... ) , so they are just defending their home planet . It's gonna involve an Infantryman who has been in the IG for 17 years and still is only in a veteran squad , who helps convince the society to denounce the Imperium ... :D 
Anyone who wants to read my Imperial Guard Legion's ( the Namtomek 1st ) Background in progress just give me your email and ill send it to you ! 
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin \ 
I make the right moves but I'm lost within \ 
I put on my daily façade but then \ 
I just end up getting hurt again \ 
By myself\ 
I ask why , but in my mind \ 
I find I can't rely on myself \ 
I can't hold on \ 
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin \ 
It's all too much to take in \ 
To anything watching everything spin \ 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
Giving KDE another try ...

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying .

So you can't see me , no not at all\ 
In another dimension , with voyeuristic intention\ 
Well-secluded , I see all\ 
With a bit of a mind flip\ 
You're there in the time slip\ 
And nothing can ever be the same\ 
You're spaced out on sensation , like you're under sedation\ 
Let's do the Time Warp again ! 
Playing with a $200 robot :-D \\nWatch out Cox Mill JETS . WERE COMING BACK BETTER THEN EVER !

You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack\ 
And you may find yourself in another part of the world\ 
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile\ 
You may find yourself in a beautiful house , with a beautiful wife\ 
You may ask yourself , \Well how did I get here ? \"" 
Letting the days go by let the water hold me down\ 
Letting the days go by , water flowing underground\ 
Into the blue again , after the money's gone\ 
Once in a lifetime , water flowing underground
