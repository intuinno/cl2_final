I am strong because I know my weaknesses . I'm alive because I'm a fighter . I am wise because I've been foolish . I laugh because I've known sadness . Yet life takes us through this cycle . ~ From the palace of wisdom ;) 
Feels like a day to go to the gym at night ... also this cold weather bums me out . :[ Bring back summer rains and the heat :P 
Blood , sweat , and tears . Experienced the blood and the sweat . The gym has yet to make me shed a tear :P Once more the gym brings me a lot of joy :] 
Early morning tv is terrible :[ 
I think I actually prefer snow , burning heat , or rain . OVER freezing cold wind with the sun out -/- 
Ideally waking up early is a good thing , except when you run out of things to do and its only 10:50 ... xD 
-_- I hate eating when I'm anxious -_- 
Repair guy said he would be back ... an hour ago :[ It looks like I'm going to the gym at night :( ... it's a cold day today D:

Dear mtv . I tolerated you being taken over by this \Teen mom\ " show . Yes the first was wasn't great but I tolerated it . You have come out with 3 other seasons I believe . And frankly . I've had it ... bring back my reality tv where bitches and hoes are going at it . Thank you . " 
Off to work , techno is amazing . Haha just saying . 
Watched paranormal activity with the family And I was teasing everyone near the end and when the chick went at the screen it scared me so much that I farted lol 
Going to watch < PROPMALE > potter today ~ :] 
Before I go off to < PROPMALE > pottah ~ I must say facebook is an addicting site . Why ? Because people use it for everything , love , friendship , games . And that's what it was for . BUT WHAT IS WAS NOT FOR was to constantly spam \I love you\ " \ " Miss you\ " \ " I need you\ " yadada da . Keep that in your private conversations . Because just because you post in 100times a day doesn't mean you really feel that way . " 
< PROPMALE > potter was sweeeeeet . Lame ending kinda . Yeaaaah 
Wow I'm fat -_- 
Damn I'm tired . Going to crash after a quick shower ... Offspring is righteous music to work out too hahaha OH YEAH MUSIC YEAH
