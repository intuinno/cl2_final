Where has time gone ? Seems like it was only a month ago I was celebrating 2010 .... 

I believe the destruction of the US is now upon us with the passing of the healthcare < PROPMALE > 
I just heard a great < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > joke : \ < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > can roundhouse kick < PROPFIRST > Bieber into puberty\ " :P " 
I think we just had an Earthquake .... for real ... 
Police scanners have just confirmed that yes , it was an earthquake 
Apparently , the earthquake came from California 
Who else saw Kick-Ass ? 
It's surprising how much a good song can motivate you . 
Man ..... I hate the Red Wings .... 
I was looking forward to sleeping in , then I realized that I have to take a 3 hour test tomorrow O_O 
Has anyone else realized that most of the music in Doom 1 and 2 is just famous metal songs ? 
Quite an amazing day .... Last friday before summer break , Mr T's birthday and the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man ... Go to Google and play the Pac-Man game there , I want to see who has the highest score ( they even gave it the level 256 kill screen .... that's pretty awesome . ) 
YEAH ! I'M GOING TO PHOENIX COMICON TOMORROW !!! 
First day of Comicon was amazing .... 
< PROPFIRST > Hopper died ... not even the Koopa < PROPMALE > is safe from death .... 
Phoenix Comicon Day 2 is over for me , I hope I can go tomorrow , but I doubt it ... 
Wow , 8 Bit Covers of Weezer songs are awesome ... 
I listened to all of SOAD's albums today ... 
Dude , if only the Big 4 tour came here to < PROPFEMALE > ..... 
E3 TOMORROW !!! 
NEW XBOX MODEL SHIPS TODAY !!!!! Although , the press confrenece was rather lackluster . With Natal being renamed to Kinect , a lot of Kinect games were shown , but none interest me at all ( it's the same dang thing as Wii Sports . ) 
Baisic big news : All CoD games from now until 2012 will hit the 360 before the PS3 , new Xbox model ships today , ESPN is free for those who have Gold Live , Halo Reach is coming soon , Gears Of War 3 is somehere on the horizon , Kinect launches November 4th ( check me on that ) and Metal Gear Solid is nowhere close to what it used to be . 
NEW MEME ALERT ! http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/8155/kinect.gif 
Now onto the EA confrence ! 
The Big EA news : The devs of Burnout are remaking Need For Speed : Hot Pursuit ( the best NFS EVER ! ) Dead Space 2 is still tense , Medal Of Honor looks to destroy CoD online the beta starts June 21 but if you pre order it now , you can get into the beta in 2 days . 
EA news contin . The sports franchises seem to be getting support , Bulletstorm blew my mind and < PROPFEMALE > Wars : The Old Republic has the most amazing trailer ever . I'll get the release dates in a minute ... \ 
\ 
However , the most mind blowing part of the show was that they didn't show Rock Band 3 .... Why ? 
Dead Space 2 : < PROPFIRST > . 25 2011\ 
Need For Speed : Hot Pursuit : Nov . 16 \ 
Bulletstorm : Feb . 22 2011\ 
EA Sports Active 2 : Nov . 16th ( it's now multiplatform instead of Wii only . )\ 
EA Sports MMA : 2010 Holiday season\ 
Also , new Battlefield Bad Company 2 exapansion this winter ( it's free ) 
On to the final press confrence of the day , Ubisoft . Not looking forward to this at all , last year it was all about AVATAR and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > .... And Pele talking for about 20 minutes as the presentation stopped working .... Hey , at least there's a new Ghost Recon to look forward to . 
I don't even like Assassin's Creed .... but that live demo was EARTHSHATTERING ! 
WOAH , UBISOFT WASH ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD ! The battle is on between the new Ghost Recon and Medal Of Honor ( forget all about CoD . )\ 
I'm going to be blogging this later , so look forward to then . 
For those of you wondering what I'm talking about : check out my blog . http://www.gametrailers.com/users/anotherfanboy/gamepad/ 
NEW < PROPFEMALE > !!! Zelda : Skyward Sword . \ 
Miyamoto says \Don't expect it until next year . \ " \ 
BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG NEWS from Nintendo !!!! 
Alright , the Wii News : started off strong with the new Zelda : Skyward Sword , it looks graphically insane and has a new control scheme , but you need Motion Plus , it's a lot of real swordplay , Miyamoto says don't expect until 2011 . The next game was < PROPFIRST > Sports mix which is < PROPFIRST > Volleyball , < PROPFIRST > Hockey and < PROPFIRST > Basketball . More on next update ..... 
Then they showed a game using every Mii ever made called Mii Party ( otherwise known as < PROPFIRST > Party . ) Then < PROPFEMALE > Sun DS : Dark < PROPFEMALE > ( which looks pretty good . ) They next showed Epic < PROPFIRST > which looks really really good and has me sold . There was an unveiling for a new < PROPFIRST > game for the Wii named ; < PROPFIRST > : Epic Yarn . The new < PROPFIRST > game also has really beautiful graphics . More on next update ... 
Dragon Quest IX is coming to < PROPFEMALE > on the DS , Other M was shown in greater depth and the guys who made Metroid are making a new Donkey Kong Country named Donkey Kong Country Returns ! coming this holiday season . \ 
Finally , Goldeneye remake is proven true and coming this holiday , but the best news is on the next update . 
The biggest news of the show ? The 3DS ! You can adjust the level of 3D with a slider , you do have an analog with a motion sensor and gyro sensor , a camara on the inside and one of the cooler features , 2 cameras on the outside . \ 
The 2 cameras take pictures in 3D ! The games for the 3DS in the next update . 
Games for the 3DS : Kid Icarus reboot named Kid Icarus : Uprising . \ 
New Nintendogs+Cats\ 
DJ Hero 3D\ 
New Professor Layton\ 
Kingdom Hearts 3D ( shweet)\ 
Assassin's Creed\ 
Metal Gear Solid ( shweet)\ 
Resident Evil ( also shweet)\ 
Ridge Racer ( lol)\ 
( Possibly a new Starfox)\ 
and the most lawlzy of them all , Saint's Row ( lol ) 
Nintendo did an amazing job , I don't know if Sony can compete ! 
Although , not all of those 3DS games have been proven other than Kid Icarus , but it sure makes me excited .... 
Sony was alright , Killzone 3 looks good , but too much emphasis on 3D and Move , there's good games coming out thouigh . Tons of exclusive content , a new added benefits pay for system , a new Twisted Metal ( finally ! ) And Gabe Newell literally saying that the PS3 version will be the definitive version of Portal 2 ( I wonder how PC is going to take that . ) 
http://www.gametrailers.com/users/anotherfanboy/gamepad/?action=viewblog&id=518399\ 
^Check out my blog , it covers everything today 
Kick-Ass the comic is way different than Kick-Ass the movie ... 
I hope < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim is going to be good ..... 
E3 2011 is June 7-9 
Not gonna lie , I cried multiple times during Toy Story 3 . 
Who do I root for now that USA lost ? 
For those wondering why I haven't been on ; the power supply on my PC blew . Sorry , but don't expect to see me on here too often ... I have to try to find a replacement . 
Thanks for all those birthday wishes , not having a computer puts me behind on that stuff . Also , Inception is quite literally , tied with the best movie I have ever seen ... 
I just beat Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days ... man there's a lot to say about that game . 
What's worse , Creed or Nickelback ? 
Just finished watching Akira . I don't know what it is about Japanese animated movies that came out at this time , but all that I've seen have left me dissatisfied with the ending . 
Video Games Live is on in 10 minutes .... I MUST SEE ! 
1 . Anatomy- Evans\ 
2 . Concert Band- Britton\

I seriously can't wait for < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim O_O 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World : The Game is pretty fun . < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim fans will be kind of disappointed , but those who love 90's Beat-Em'-Ups will be greatly satisfied . 
The < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim movie was so incredible man . JUST GO OUT AND SEE IT ! Expendables was also good too , but really wasn't great other than the explosions . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim is now number 4 on my favorite movies of all time . 
Best Friday the 13th ever . < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was freaking amazing ... 
For those who read the book , the book ending and the movie ending are exactly the same . 
Wow , I'm extremely disappointed how little < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim has made in < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
SERIOUSLY , SEE THAT MOVIE . Man , I guess geeks are easily defeated :( 
The < PROPFIRST > ending to < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs The World : The Game is freaking awful\ 
no seriously , just awful 
It's official , my favorite actress is now < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Winstead . 
I saw < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim a second time . That movie still rocks my socks .... 
Does anyone else out there know what post-hardcore music is ? \ 
It's become my new genre I'm listening to ... 
Reading about Blackwater ...... It's a scary world we live in . 
The Biblical story of Samson would make an awesome video game . It'd be like God Of War and Metal Gear Solid ( more specifically 3 ) mixed together . 
If you find pictures of me in a dress , that was for Spanish class . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > has just made me lose the game in the most creative way I have ever seen . 
I will be laughing when we're watching 2012 in 2013 . 
I finally watched BASEketball . It's tied with Team < PROPFEMALE > for me , so it basically means , it's pretty awesome . 
Only 1 more paragraph for Spanish ... At least it's an easy one , things that bother me .... 
DUKE NUKEM ' FOREVER IS COMING NEXT YEAR ! \ 
Oh finally man , 14 years .... It looks pretty cool so far . 
I'm hearing voices , animal noises\ 
The creme de la creme , effeminate abyss\ 
And I'm reaching my threshold\ 
Staring at the truth ' till I'm blind 
Wow ... < PROPMALE > Leinart has just been released from the Cardinals . 
First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin . Then , shalt thou count to three , no more , no less . Three shalt be the number thou shalt count , and the number of the counting shall be three . Four shalt thou not count , nor either count thou two , excepting that thou then proceed to three . Five is right out . 
Once\ 
the number three , being the third number , be reached , then lobbest thou\ 
thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe , who , being naughty in\ 
my sight , shall snuff it . 
Wow , Glee sucks ... It's like High School Musical , but instead of having it's own terrible music , it takes good stuff and destroys it .... 
Heh , the new Google background is pretty sweet .... 
Woah , < PROPFIRST > Portnoy just quit Dream Theater . 
Tonight , I filmed my first concert ( professional . ) 
I switched my Facebook language to Spanish ( Mexico ) you know , just to work on it a bit ... but I realized ... it's stupid . 
I've just now changed my language to 1337 SP34K . \ 
I figure this will actually pertain more to what I do daily than Spanish ... \ 
Should I be worried ? 
I just learned to play \Heat Of The Moment\ " on guitar ... what a classic . " 
A video game from 25 years ago is still one of the best games you can play right now . 
Oh Halo Reach .... Everyone knows you won't be as good as Halo 1 , but they're still going to buy you ... \ 
Plus , everyone knows the ending anyway . 
Here , I'll save you the trouble . Reach gets glassed . \ 
There , now the only reason to get Halo Reach is for Forge and Multiplayer ! 
So don't delay act now supplies are running out \ 
\ 
Allow , if you're still alive , six to eight years to arrive \ 
And if you follow there may \ 
Be a tomorrow but if \ 
the offers shunned \ 
you might as well be walking on the sun .... * keyboard solo ! * 
Just made a list of the top 30 most difficult Guitar Hero songs , check it out . http://www.gametrailers.com/users/anotherfanboy/gamepad/?action=viewblog&id=526832 
Wow , an new Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden ! 
The new Weezer album is actually really good . 
Uwe Boll seriously made a decent movie , I'm surprised ... 
Finally learned Say It Ain't so by Weezer on guitar . You'd think it'd be easy , but man , Rivers has skills . 
Wow man ... today sucked .... :( 
The ending to K-ON !! made me cry .... 
Kingdom Hearts : Birth By Sleep is exactly what I want from a portable Kingdom Hearts . 
Wow , Pokemon Black And White have almost sold 3 MILLION IN JAPAN IN TWO DAYS . \ 
In other news , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is making a video game based on Inception , which will be a pre-order for me . 
:( \ 
Did I do something wrong ? 
September 29th , we'll finally know about the 3DS . 
Looks like I have to scrap another song I've been writing :( 
Wow , the new Serj album .... Really is bad . You're right < PROPFIRST > . 
Listening to a Beatmania soundtrack . Has there ever been a more cheesy club music soundtrack ever ? Oh those Japanese .... 
KILL THE ORCS , SLAY THE ORCS , DESTROY THE ORCS !!!!!! 
Seems like I messed up again . \ 
Then again ... when don't I ? 
I have an idea for a my metal album . It's going to be entirely based off of the book of Revelation . 
Normally , I hate rain . But it hailed today .... \ 
My friend and I turned on some viking metal , ran out in the hail in front of everyone and pretended to be vikings . People joined ... IT WAS SICK ! 
Please put this as your status if you know , or are related to , someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . People must understand that the Empire is a band of murders bent on universal domination . The Rebel Alliance seeks peace for the galaxy , but the ... Galactic Empire continues to kill innocent civilians 
Only certain people are going to get this , but I just learned Calligraphy Pen ~ Ballpoint Pen ~ on guitar . \ 
I don't know why it took me so long to actually figure out how to play it .... It's simple :P 
Doing what I haven't done in a while . \ 
Making chiptune music ! 
Time to actually use an good program for Chiptunes . Trackers just aren't doing it for me . 
For the last time , we did not order a giant trampoline . 
10/10/10\ 
Well well well .... 
I think it's mandatory that you have an interesting 10/10/10 
My 10/10/10 was pretty good :P 
Watching a live stream of the first level of Medal of Honor ! 
The new Medal Of Honor looks exactly like Bad Company . 
Wow , I guess I'm not getting the new Medal Of Honor . 
I wonder what would happen if < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > had a kid .... 
I also wonder what would happen if < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > L < PROPMALE > had a kid .... 
I'm angry at myself -_- \ 
It seems I dun goofed again .

Writing a Spanish rough draft . I'm at 184 of 300 words .

Up , Up , Down , Down , Left , Right , Left , Right , B , A , Start . 
Pawns standing in awe of the game . Of the stage . You've worked so hard at building an empire of secret rooms to display yourself and add to your wealth . \ 
The sting of , oh , it stings when I saw it all come crashing . I witnessed the sound of a million voices screaming for a public hanging !! 
I don't know why , but I really want Cheetos right now .... 
Disregard Tsunderes , acquire < PROPFEMALE > . 
They just patched the PC version of New Vegas . This hilarious glitch was probably a catalyst . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToKIkw3LIoQ 
A taco without taco sauce is a taco without the soul . 
Before I die , I must visit Sealand . 
Man , playing Fallout while sick makes it really scary ... 
Ok , now there are 3 places I must visit before I die . Sealand , The Republic Of Molossia and Japan . 
I have mono ! Yeah ! 
It's great knowing that someone will never talk to you again now that they know you have mono ! \ 
-_- 
Oh man , I can feel the spleen enlargement part now .... 
So glad Oklahoma lost ! 
The Browns ....... seriously ....... just beat the Saints .... 
Yay ! More Tenacious D music debuted at BlizzCon ! 
Man , a night of only listening to Plumtree :) 
My New Vegas Collectors Edition finally arrived . 
Listening to a band I haven't in forever , Killswitch Engage . I forgot how awesome they are ... 
Just came home from school and BLASTED gabber music . 
Why does everyone think Takeshi Shudo was the creator of Pokemon ? He was just the chief writer . True he was important , but he hasn't worked on the thing since the 3rd movie . 
Reading the Fallout wiki , SO MUCH FICTION ! D: 
Man , I'm bummed that I missed Head play ..... 
Learning to play Caravan so I can go to school tomorrow and play it :D 
I learned to play Caravan . May I say that that card game , is the most messed up card game , EVER . 
I actually managed to play Caravan in school today . Yeah , that game is still messed up ... 
Oh how Facebook must constantly change -_- 
Wow , new Riddick movie ! Awesome .... 
My sister got a bloody nose ....... from facepalming too hard . \ 
I believe that deserves a facepalm and an \Epic Fail . \"" 
Three shall be the number thou shalt count , and the number of the counting shall be three .

< PROPFIRST > Cage's 4'33\ is the most beautiful piece of music I've ever heard . " 
I just bought the Knives < PROPFEMALE > add-on for the < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim game . 
YES ! After their New Zealand tour , Metallica plans to write a new album ! 
Bought < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim on Blu-Ray . I have done almost everything on that disc .... 
A Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love a Veteran , or support the Troops .

Sometimes i wanna copy someone's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
Competitive Super Street Fighter IV is intense O_O 
So many awesome guests are gonna be at Phoenix Comicon this year ! 
Nothing like a game of Tressel ball ..... 
It's official Final Fantasy < PROPFEMALE > is the best Final Fantasy . 
Lawlz , Club Nintendo sent me two figures instead of one , for being a platinum member . Comes in a sweet box :P does you want pics ? 
If you like 28 Days/Weeks Later , I Am Legend and post-breakout zombie stories , go watch/read The Walking Dead . 
That's it , I must be fully trained in the < PROPMALE > of the plot twist now ..... 
Maestra Kimzen es la bomba . 
I swear , I will stab the next person that talks about Where's The Chapstick ?!? 
BOXXY IS BACK !!! FOR SRS !!!! Well , she just showed up again , she doesn't have a new video ....

I look like < PROPFIRST > Welch :D 
Christmas List : Money ...... 
Watching Interstella 5555 again :P 
I want to play the new Splatterhouse , just for the soundtrack . 
Steam is practically GIVING AWAY games ..... 
The Pokemon battle theme song is one of the most difficult songs you can play on guitar .... so much sweep picking .... 
Just finished watching a documentary on Woodstock . I wish something that awesome could happen with my generation . 
System Of A Down are widely expected to announce that they are reforming on Monday November 29 !!!! 
OH NO , WHAT HAVE I DONE ! THERE IS NOW 14 DIFFERENT NOTES SHOWING UP FROM EVERYONE O_O 
It's things like episode 20 of Macross Frontier that are the entire reason I watch anime . Why isn't there anything like this in American shows ? 
System is back !!!! But only for a tour ... oh man , I can only hope they're releasing a new album .... 
Just had a glass of egg nog . I forgot how awesome this time of year is .... 
Just\ 
finished a 20 minute preview of Daft Punk's soundtrack to Tron Legacy . \ 
It's wildly different than anything they've ever done . You can tell they\ 
were limited to what they could do as all of the tracks are very \ 
symphonic and kind of forgettable . Not to say their flavor isn't there , \ 
but if you're looking to see this for them , you'll be disappointed . Makes me sad :( 
Smugleaf FTW ! 
The internet has finally found nudes of Miley < PROPMALE > . It was just a matter of time . It's not a shop either , the proof is in the PUDDI PUDDI through some almost CSI level of handiwork . \ 
Someone is going to have some explaining to do .... 
I finished Macross Frontier , excellent EXCELLENT show . \ 
I prefer Macross over Gundam now . 
It seriously took me until now to finish New Vegas . 
Going to buy my Phoenix Comicon tickets soon . \ 
Every time I think about it , I get more and more excited .... 
Finished typing my New Vegas review . 
Just learned how to play the riff from the < PROPFIRST > Halen classic , Ain't Talkin ' ' Bout Love . 
Man , life has me down ... 
I've decided to go by myself for the next couple days . All I seem to do anymore is hurt people and I'm sick of hurting them and hurting myself . I think I need some time by myself to rethink all I've done ... I don't exactly know how I'll move on . \ 
And for those that I have hurt . All I can say is sorry ..... You don't have to forgive me .... I don't feel like I deserve it anyway . 
For those seeing Becoming The Archetype .... I'm jelly ..... 
Just bought Inception on Blu-Ray and the new Daft Punk Tron Legacy soundtrack . 
For those who are cheap , I will be uploading the Tron Legacy soundtrack . 
528491 \ 
There's honestly , too much to say here . You're my best friend . Thanks for sticking with me when I've been a jerk , we've had a ton of laughs together and man , I can't thank you enough for all the food you've given me and how much you and your parents have put up with my crap :P 
I love SNSD and I don't like K-Pop that much .... 
Time to write a review for the Daft Punk Tron : Legacy soundtrack . \ 
Main points : If you like Daft Punk , stay away . If you like the original Tron score , stay away . If you're looking for a solid movie soundtrack however , this will definitely be up there with Inception and Dark Kinght . 
Oh man , I found the most amazing fan-fic in a random notebook at lunch .... 
Watching Inception with a notebook writing down every little detail I can . 
My Inception notes ? 4 pages . Includes margin scribblings . \ 
To be honest , there still isn't any way to tell if it's a dream or not . However , there are some things leading me to believe it is now . 
I just finished < PROPFEMALE>'s A Night At The Opera . That has to be one of the greatest albums I've ever listened to . Why does music suck now ? 
YES ! THE NEW AQUABATS ALBUM COMES OUT JANUARY 18TH !!! 
Oh man , can't wait for that Spanish final -_- 
Saw Tron . Simply meh , although < PROPFEMALE > Wilde is incredibly hot . 
Am I the only one who didn't enjoy the visuals in Tron ? 
Spring 2011 is an amazing time for anime . 
We are your average ordinary SUPERHUMAN , punishers of evil , rock and roll band ! 
Why does Haste The Day have to break up ? :( 
* cue movie trailer music * \3 things he wants ....... \ " * bass drum smash * \ " 1 Christmas ........ \ " * bass drum smash * \ " He can only buy ...... \ " * horn blast * \ " One thing ...... : * timpani roll*\ 
Was awoken by Vuvuzelas this morning . 
Panty and Stocking gets the anime of 2010 award from me . 
Nothing says < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS ! Like chocolate covered bacon . 
I'd gladly give up presents and money if I could spend Christmas with my relatives ... 
Black Swan is absolutely brilliant . This is one you can't afford to miss . * disclaimer , this movie isn't for everyone . * 
How can I be lost if I've got nowhere to go ? Search for seas of gold how come it's got so cold ? How can I be lost in remembrance I relive . And how can I blame you when it's me I can't forgive ? 
Finished Batman Arkham Asylum . 
Thinking of you , wherever you are . \ 
We pray for our sorrows to end , and hope that our hearts will blend . Now I will step forward to realize this wish . \ 
And who knows ? \ 
Starting a new journey may not be so hard , or maybe it has already begun . \ 
There are many worlds , but they share the same sky . One sky , one < PROPFEMALE > . 
Primus has inspired me to play bass more . 
SCOOPS ! SCOOPS HAAGEN DAZS ! 
Got LittleBigPlanet 2 Collector's Edition and the new Aquabats album . That's a pretty sweet day . 
Gameboy and Gameboy Color games will be available digitally on the 3DS store . Now if only they did that when they said it would back on the DSi ...... 
I saw the live-action Gantz movie . Very cool , but not the same as the anime . People there were fun though . 
Thinking of ideas for a movie I'm working on with < PROPMALE > Mayer and a couple others called , The Crucible : Vengeance . 
This < PROPFEMALE > timeline is probably the most speculation I have ever given to a paper . 
I don't care what their management says , Daft Punk IS The Third Twin . 
If my mom and dad were geeks like me , they'd be really into steampunk . 
Come on Steelers ! Please ! 
Steelers vs . Packers , just the way I wanted it to be . 
The most hilarious part of the day today was that someone tried to argue that Halo had more depth than Metal Gear Solid . 
65th in the world at Bulletstorm NBD . 
Now 40th in the world at Bulletstorm with a score of 10,755 . Again , NBD . 
I'm gonna be honest , the PSP 2 looks totally amazing and I'm convinced to buy it . 
5 Centimeters Per Second is one of the greatest movies I've ever watched . Yes , I'm crying . 
I love the amount of fights at my school . Shame I only get to catch one in ten . 
Adrenaline starts to flow . You're thrashing all around . Acting like a maniac . WHIPLASH ! 
Here comes the heat , nuclear summer ! 
Killzone 3 Open Beta , YEAH ! 
Skankin ' to Five Iron Frenzy ! 
And you wonder why I hate the Black Eyed Peas .... 
The halftime show was absolutely awful . Not even Slash could save the epic fail . Please , never do that to Sweet Child ever again . 
And there it goes .... 
ACTIVISION HAS JUST AXED GUITAR HERO ! 
Just added one of the best gaming poems ever to my favorite quotations . 
Finished my < PROPFEMALE > timeline paper . Now onto graphs for said timeline ! 
Just shaved off my goatee . 
Do you like the REAL Deadpool ? Well boy , MVC3 is perfect for you . 
The defeat of Toonami caused the downfall of cartoons .

I finally figured out the backmasked message in the beginning of L.O.V.E by < PROPFIRST > \Head\ " Welsh . " 
Kingdom Hearts : Birth By Sleep is by far the most important game canon wise . Too bad everything that matters canon wise is either secret or at the end of the game . 
Happy 25th birthday The Legend Of < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Why can't iTunes support FLAC ? 
Killzone 3 is incredibly intense . If you like Killzone 2 , you should feel at home with Killzone 3 . 
Killzone 3 was great , but man , that's the shortest game I've ever played . I beat it my first try on Veteran ( which is the hardest difficulty you can pick your first time through ) and died 172 times , but still managed to beat it in just under 5 hours . Time for Elite difficulty . 
Man , in hindsight the N64 is really overrated .... 
I saw The Aquabats ! today . I moshed , I skanked with awesome dudes , hugged pretty ladies during Hey Homies ! and got to hi-five and crowd surf the Bat Commander . Plus , my sister got an Aquabats guitar pick ! I'm wet from the sweat and the water they threw everywhere , I bought a shirt , they played an amazing setlist from songs throughout their entire career , it was just incredible . 
Almost a year later , I finally beat FFXIII .... 
Speaking at a talk during the Game Developer Conference today , designer < PROPFEMALE > Suzuki said that he thinks Sega is going to let him make Shenmue III . The audience broke into shouts and applause , and then Suzuki abruptly changed topics . I'm telling you , 2011 is the year of video game miracles !!! 
My friend is letting me borrow his copy of Persona 3 FES . I haven't been this addicted to a game since Fallout . The perfect thing to keep my mind off of my front tooth , which I could end up losing due to a freaking pretzel . 
Please , don't date someone just to fill a hole in your life .... That's what Twinkies are for . 
A new reason to buy the new pokemon . One is a 2 scoop ice cream cone . 
Wow , I was actually awake for the northern Japan earthquake .... 
If my cat was a pokemon , it could learn tackle , growl , tail whip , scratch , bite , stockpile and spit-up . 
How do you do it ? Make me feel like I do . 
Kiefer March died .... I can't believe it . I haven't had a class with him since 8th grade , but in 8th grade , I remember the times we had . I'll miss you man ... 
What is the better cartoon animal friend ? < PROPFIRST > from SpongeBob or Porkchop from < PROPMALE > ? 
Well , it's no longer FRIDAY . 
I realized looking like a dirty hipster is too mainstream . So I shaved off all of my facial hair except for my goatee . 
I wish there was another Pokemon event :( 
Ride on , shooting < PROPFEMALE > . Fly on , Albatross . 
Bought Fooly Cooly . 
I'm sorry Primus for removing all of your albums from my computer . It's not that I don't like you . It's that I can never find the mood in which I want to listen to you . 
Just watched Dead Leaves . Only those who love insanity will enjoy :D 
Happy 15th anniversary Biohazard !
