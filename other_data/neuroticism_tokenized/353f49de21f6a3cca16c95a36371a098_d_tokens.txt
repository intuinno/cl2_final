I have a tattoo , so I'm a trouble maker . I have curves , so I'm fat . If I wear make-up , I'm fake . If I say what I think , I'm a bitch . If I cry sometimes , I'm a drama < PROPFEMALE > . If I have guy friends , I'm a slut . If I stand up for myself , I'm mouthy . Seems like you can't do anything without being labeled . So what ? Go ahead and label me , see if I give a shit ! Re-post this if you're proud of who you are . I am . :)
