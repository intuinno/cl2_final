Long day of house cleaning from slacking off during leave ... 
I can't believe a baby stroller just kicked my butt .... I took it apart and washed it yesterday ( < PROPFIRST > being almost 13mths I figured it was time ) putting the cover back on was way more complicated than it should have been .

the smell of coffee brewing in the morning .... mmmmmmmm 
I love craigslist ! Got to do laundry and feed the baby and then maybe another nap ? the one in the car was way too short .

Sleepy time now .... missing my sweetheart ... Sweet dreams everyone . 
Why is it that my lovely son who is usually such a good sleeper picks the day i have something to do in the morning to be a random insomniac ... he's not sick/hungry/wet any of the normal things , and he's fine , he just seriously doesn't want to sleep .... ?? 
Playgroup time :) 
I hate computers ! 
I'm so not having a good day today , my main computer crashed and its going to cost a fortune to fix it , my car got broken into and my GPS and hubby's favorite leather jacket got stolen , so I called to police to file a report and now I find out the cops have been having problems with teenagers in my neighborhood ..... and if I see groups of them walking around I'm supposed to call 911 ..... great ...................... 
Did my first Skype today ! Spiffy ! Love you babe !

Today is definitly a day for \Big Girl Panties\ " but I'm not sure where I put them .... " 
Keep silence for a minute at 3 p.m. , ' National Moment of Remembrance ' \ 
Memorial day is a time to remember the service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice , to reflect on the sacrifices and to pray . Remind your children today what it means , share in the moment of remembrance . To those who gave their lives , the ones I knew , the millions I didn't ... I remember , I salute , and I thank ... on this day and everyday . 
... blah ... 
Mowing the lawn in 94 Degrees is the bane of my existence ....... I'm gonna have to mow the lawn in the dark just so I won't get heat stroke .... ugh ... 
If one more person asks me why my son has blonde hair , i think i will scream and go stick my head in a bucket of bleach !!!!! ARGH !!! 
True Blood Tonight !!!!!!!! 
New True Blood on Sunday !! 
Happy Fathers Day to the Dad's out there !! 
< PROPFIRST > , slowly advancing toward Sookie : “Oh I’m not leaving . You’re going to invite me in so I can protect you . Or have passionate primal sex with you . How ‘bout both ? ” 
I am defeated . :( My Dryer broke and I totally fixed it and I was totally proud of myself ... EXCEPT .... it was a 2 part problem , now the problem is the actual house ... waiting on the landlord to call back ... 
4th of July on the 2nd ! That was fun , good food , good company , good concert , good fireworks ! :) Only thing missing was my husband .

There have been a lot of comments about a recent news report that all combat Soldiers are out of Iraq . Please remember , no matter what Washington or the media would have you believe , there are thousands of combat Soldiers still in Iraq . I know that MY combat soldier is still there . Please keep the 50,000 + soldiers remaining in Iraq in your prayers . It's not over until they are ALL home !

I don't feel good . :( 
I just got back from ER and apparently I have strep throat or something .... I don't know where I would have caught it because < PROPFIRST > seems fine . X Here's to hoping I'm not miserable for too long . :) Taking antibiotics for the first time in I don't know how long . School tomorrow , fun fun . 
< PROPFIRST > is sooo grounded , he took advantage of Mommy being sick and while I wasn't looking colored in almost an entire 12x12 tile on my floor !!!!!! With Brick Red Crayon !!!! 
When used in moderation antibiotics can be a WONDERFUL thing !! ? 
I'm taking astronomy in school , so now I'm standing at the edge of my driveway looking like a dummy looking up at the sky ... BUT ... I've found : Jupiter , Vega , Altair and Pegusus , if it was a little darker I think I could see more , I can always find Cassiopia but I can't see her tonight , and I should be able to see Andromeda because I can see Pegasus but oh well , maybe another time ... 
Wow !! What a fun and exciting birthday party ! Happy first birthday < PROPFIRST > and Rylan ! 
Dear Night Terrors : \ 
I understand you are a developmental normalcy , but I would really appreciate it if you could move along now , because its really not helping us right now . \ 
Thank You , \ 
< PROPFIRST>'s Mom . 
So went back for the Tonsillitis , apparently one round of antibiotics wasn't enough . So went back in tonight , and they gave me even more drugs ... here's to hoping that this round really kicks it ! I can't miss anymore of my life ...

Sweet !! Free FUZE at School !!! 
Just did the final walk to Iraq and Back Freedom Walk !! 
Monday Monday ..... 
Went to class ... and the Professor said , never mind , no class today . Hey works for me , more study time ! :D 
Everytime i see some one in red shoes .... I think to myself ... There's no place like home , there's no plave like home .. 
... ... ... One of those days ... ... ... 
I wish so that heaven would phone . To hear your voice . I thought of you today , that is nothing new .. I think of you in silence . The only thing I have left are memories , your teachings and your photos . God has you in his arms and I in my heart forever . Would give anything to hold you again even for a minute . ( Copy and paste this into your wall if you have someone you love in heaven ) 
Okay , time to study for my astronomy exam , I'm not very good at science so wish me luck ! 
It has been a really long day . Time to expire . 
This is ridiculous , 1/2 of the chapter we had to read for class today discussed womens rights & suffrage , but when I brought it up the professor basically dismissed it & insisted that we focus solely on the abolition of slavery , & who cares if women only participated as second class citizens , at least they got to participate . You can't just ignore half a chapter because it doesn't suit your agenda . This is Bullshit !! 
Happy Second Birthday to our Baby Boy < PROPFIRST > !!! They grow up so fast !!! \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
I am so blessed to have such wonderful people in my life ! Thank you to all of you !
