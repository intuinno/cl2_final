Why are you wearing that stupid man suit ? 

Missing someone is when you're doing something , and in that moment you wished that they were right there with you . 
Music and Passion ... it's a thrill ride <3 . 
I could cry for days . 
Christmas is coming :) 
Christmas Christmas Christmas !!! 
Fixt My Car 
I had a very wonderful Christmas . My best friend is fabulous , and I love her very much ! <3 xoxo 
Emergency Rooms are Not my friend . Someone love on me I feel terrible ! 
Adios , 2009 ! 
Why , hello 2011 ^.^ I feel so <3 ' d . 
Girl with a mission . Lookout , I tell you . 
I need this like WHOA ! * crosses fingers * 
I got me hairs cut . 
Some days , you just get seduced by really sexy eyes . Thank you , Strongsville . 
Down , down , do your dance , do your dance . 
I got soul but I'm not a soldier 
Talking to old friends makes me SO happy :) 
Short , much needed nap , then it's out to celebrate ! ~ Happy January Birthdays < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I'm ... BATMAN ! 
Why So Serious ? 
\Love is not like anything - especially a f***ing knife . \"" 
\Dark and silent late last night I think I might have heard the highway calling .... I'm going to < PROPFEMALE > in my mind . \ " :'( " 
I went to a masquerade ball and got to wear my prom dress and it was awesome . :) 
A cracked windshield ? Really ? FML . On top of that , a monumentally shitty day at work . Abusrdly angry driver , and a cranky insider ... If you can't commit to the shift that I did not schedule you for , don't FUCKING take it out on me . 
I threw up for a solid 12 hours yesterday D: I feel like my insides were completely shreded . I need a job with personal days . My eye sockets are sunk into my skull :'( 
Feeling better , finally . Plenty of rest did the trick . I slept every < PROPMALE > I got ! ;) 
Go Saints ! ;) 
Things on Facebook are not all where I left them . 
I worked as hard and as fast as I could push myself today from 10 until 8:30 . Feeling unusually down on myself , but I suppose it's mostly fatigue . Some P.F. should do the trick . 
Windshield is being replaced in my driveway as we speak ! Thank goodness . 
I has a brand new windshield :) 
I'm gonna go get my hair done :) 
I win the sexy hair game . 
Having a very productive day . Going to lie down for the night to shake this weak chest congestion I have going on . It's like I tried to get sick and my immune system was like , no no , really . That won't be necessary . 
We are the world . We are the children . We are the ones who make a brighter day ... 
Out of work early , and it's nicer out than it's been in a while . I believe some mischief is in order . 
On this day , in the exact same year , two people were born that would have an incredible impact on my life . Happy Birthday Jenn and < PROPFEMALE > , I hope today is as wonderful as you are . 
I honestly have no idea what makes a person exorbitantly judgmental , especially when they get heated and deep about it . It's the most useless of action against one that goes unaffected by opinions , and it's rather vile to do it to intentionally inflict negativity on others . Ill will is a monumental waste of time void of logic and reason . 
\Please . If I see something I haven't seen before I'll throw a dollar at it . \"" 
\Pimp tight gett it rightt homey more or less ... Gotta T . G . I . F . \ " -Kid Cudi/Chip tha Rip " 
\Thanks for comin ' out . \"" 
Today my boss is the pretty lady and I get to work with her :) Don't worry , Jenn , I will save thee from thy finger-severing dough knives ! 
It matters to me . 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland <3 
My day did not go at all as planned :'( 
Two rough days , but things are looking up on the third . The sauna at the rec is my new best friend . 
Isn't the weather wonderful today ? :) And I'm unexpectedly out of work early ! Some days it's hard not to smile ! <3 
Attempting to clean my basement . Wish me luck ! 
Alas , the monsters of the Dungeon are strong and many . Upon retreat I fought off Dish Goblins , healed through the Agressive Paper-Cut Demons of the Square Silver Table , and leapt beyond Dust Bunnies and Nike Vomit Trolls , only to discover a place of great myth - the Room of the Living ! Gather , my friends ! Help me save these lands from impending doom ! 
I would be fine if you would just leave . 
Special place in my heart for Pop Rocks . :) Watching 1951 < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . 
\Let's do some gratuitous violence . \ " -All Saints Day " 
Ow . You'd think I'd be used to the Friday stiffness by now . 
omg Jenn time I never get Jenn time I got Jenn time YAYYYYY ! ^.^ ;; Drinking+Darts = < PROPFEMALE > WINS ! Hahahaha ... Drinking + Pool = Jenn wins ! Boooooo 
For 741 weeks , Pink < PROPMALE>'s The Dark Side of the < PROPFEMALE > ranked the Billboard 200 , from 1973 until 1988 , a record unmatched still today . Conflict , greed , time , death , mental illness - a conceptual masterpiece people know nothing and everything about . Lyrics from the first side of the album written verbatim from memory ? I need a frame , this is brilliant ! 
They had the better part of a decade to do something about the condition this house is in . Now I don't give a shit who I piss off in the process . If you want to compromise , you can go * damn learn to communicate . 
I don't think it's possible for me to make any progress AND keep Uncle < PROPFIRST > from shitting kittens , but thanks to that angel < PROPFEMALE > , progress we made ! The overwhelming support from my brother didn't hurt , either . Going to sleep and pray I clean < PROPFIRST>'s couch off before he comes over next . Stressed was a good description for the day . 
ON TO THE NEXT ONE 
I GOT A MILLION WAYS TO GET IT 
I'm loving the weather :) 
RUCKUS ! 
480 east <3 
What an amazing Easter so far !!! 
whipppppppppppsssss leddddgggessssss BECAUSE ITS BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE 
Operation Clean House is at 15% . Baby Steps are starting to feel like < PROPMALE > . Even the difference I've made pales in comparison to that which remains . I need words of encouragement right now . 
This not getting my messages thing is really starting to annoy me . House Vs . Mojo round VII ... FIGHT ! 
It's here today , not gonna stay , go right away ! To the , IX Indoor Amusement Park . ( Also PEnut's feet stink . ) olol .

Jezez said do werk son . 
And someone is playing a game in the house that I grew up in . 
Enough about me . How are YOU ? 
? I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory's a keepsake , from which I'll never part . God has you in his arms . I have you in my heart .? 
I like Jenn time so much , I had to see two Jenns today . <3 <3 
FB needs a giggle button . Just for me . 
I'M TIRED . D: 
I object ! 
I wish I had somewhere to go :'( 
I'm not sure I could be in a darker place right now . 
The storm , it's gone . So I'ma let the top down while I got the whip slowed down ... Windows down , This song shine , ( It's so ) It's so Loud . And baby it's nine if you ask ' bout the clouds , I'm so high Don't Wanna Come Down . 
Goodbye , 23 ! 
Happy Birthday Theta Xi , Duke Ellington , and -ME- . So far my day is made of win , and I'm more excited for Friday night ~!~ <3 <3 <3 New ink pictures soon to come . 
There are some happy birthday comments from people I love very very much posted below . It makes me smile hard . ^.^ Celebrating all weekend , so get at me . :D 
Unfortunately a fake smile is easily broken , and I don't think I can find all the pieces anyway . If there were ever a day to worry about me , today would be that day . 
Everything tried to come crashing down . But when I looked up , there were some really amazing people around keeping me from hitting the ground . Things aren't perfect , but I will find a way around these obstacles . <3 
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy . I'd rather run the other way and stay and see the smoke and who's still standing when it clears . 
Happy Birthday Ruba :) Mojo <3 ' s you !

You can't choose how they love you , you can only choose to feel the love ... Is anything really a mistake , or are mistakes just lessons ? 
Act your age , not your < PROPMALE > size . ( Thank you , < PROPFIRST >!) 
The last episode of Lost was titled , \The End\ " How un-original can you f***ing get . " 
Cleaning up my laptop , then this room , and possibly another computer cleaning . We shall see . 
Not as productive as I'd have wished , but that episode of House rocked my face . 
Soda pop and ritalin ...

Mentally exhausted , emotionally drained , and stiff from driving 14+ hours . My 19 hour day is over , and my 8 a.m. shift starts in 6 hours . I haven't been this tired in a long , long time . <3 Family <3 
< PROPFIRST > invited me to a cookout ! 
Do unto others that you would have them do unto you . For example don't run your mouth if you don't know what you're talking about . If you accuse someone of talking shit when they weren't , in my opinion , it gives them free reign since you're going to be ignorant enough to be assume it . I know it will be ok , because when your emotions get the best of you I won't have to deal with you anymore . 
Had a WONDERFUL weekend . The cookout ROCKED , work was pleasant and flawless , and < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday was lovely ! Happy Birthday Love ! <3 BP and FC domination are boss ! 
I guess I was due for a bad day , but damn . I did , however , manage to run into < PROPMALE > Koteles after work . 
My car is 6 today . 
One of the better conversations I've had in quite a while . 
\And I only hide what's on my mind because I can't explain . \"" 
The mind can be so beautiful . I can't help but smile right now , but after seeing the Lake at night , how could you not ? 
I was feeling extremely happy , until I was reminded I shouldn't be .

:( they chased off one of the few pleasant people I work with . wtf :( 
All I can say , is I wasn't expecting THAT to happen .

I did not get to see everyone I wanted , nor did I get to see anyone as long as I wanted , but for a few days I was not blinded by stress , but reminded of beauty . I <3 NC , and I love the angels I met there that I'm lucky enough to call my friends .

Busy day today . Finally a day off when everything is not closed . Running some much needed errands , fixing two computers , and hopefully finding a pool before I melt . 
Going swimming for a little while . I still have a lot to do but it's so hot :( 
I <3 yoo :] 
LJ ... WTF . 
Sunburned , bad . Ouchies . 
I support/expect NBA players to make decisions in their best interest , but have some respect for your fans that exhausted their hard-earned time and money . You can take the < PROPMALE > off the throne , but you can't take the throne out of the City . And F * < PROPMALE>'s lack of character and empty promises . Can I get a finals game I haven't seen before , or should I just watch the old Boston v . L.A. championships on repeat ? 
the only place I feel ok is alone in my car 
There is one thing about < PROPMALE > I do admire in all of this . The amount of passion it incited proves interesting . People burned shirts , fancy owner people wrote nasty letters , and facef * is littered with LBJ this and stfu about LBJ that . 
I have many things to look forward to tomorrow :) going to see the BP Fireworks with my loves , and I get to see my wonderful Jenn and some of her awesome family ( and omg soon to be family !!! ) , and I just hope the rest of my day is as cool as all that :] I have faith though . :] Sweet dreams , everyone . ^.^ 
:] Maslanka's , Home Days , Blue House , Fireworks . ^.^ Ahhhh yay ! 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > knocked us out both balls simultaneously one cup , so the next time we played I death cupped them . I'm swattin ' bounces left and right , there's drunk people knockin ' game winning cups over and I blew out at LEAST 4 balls . Then we're up against < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ( Team Death seriously ) and we knock ' em out first shot same cup ... I didn't care about winning after that ;)))))) 
When is < PROPMALE > Cage going to retire ? 
My horoscope did not lie , it was a very calm day . I am content and I am happy . TGIF , because that means tomorrow is < PROPFEMALE>'s bachelorette party and I get to see my wonderful Jenns . Plural . Because there are two of them . :) <3 
** Rated R . **\

She lied to my face , and she tried to use me to ho around the house . She disrespected my family and had no regard their feelings . It's cool though . I'm not wasting my time being mad , but if I see her again I might put my fist through her face on principal . Maybe I'll tell her I'm not here to do that first . ;) 
Going down town tonight to celebrate with the future Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > Maslanka :) Congratulations :) <3 I'm so happy for you !

Today , keep < PROPFIRST > Koch in your heart and thoughts . She's one of the most beautiful people I've ever met , and on my top ten list that if there were anything I could do to keep her from feeling such pain , I would not hesitate . Work . Wedding . Funeral . Life . 
WHY IS THE RUM GONE !? 
It didn't hit me that she wasn't going to be around until I woke up this morning and she wasn't here . Dammmn . :((( 
ok martian death flu , you have overstayed your welcome ! working all day . I'm a zombie . 
I'm so sick and I haven't been sleeping well . Then I worked a solid 14 hours , with almost no time to eat , and no break . Now my biceps ache , my wrists are on fire , and I'm a little shaky . I'm not getting out of bed tomorrow for anyone . No . Go away , I don't even care . 
WE BUILT THIS CITY ... WE BUILT THIS CITY ON ROCK AN ' ROLL ... 
I can finally say I'm starting to really feel better :) I'm off to the Canfield Fair to meet < PROPFIRST > for the first time . I'm so excited I could shit bubbles . XD 
it's a crime to have not known him until now . he's such an amazing pe 
whoops haha stupid fb for blackberry . 
my brother < PROPFIRST > is amazing . this was more than I could have asked for . I love him so much . we rode the twister together , and I'm out of words to describe what an incredible feeling this is . 
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good ... 
Dear True Blood , at the very least , if you're going to levitate your vampires , please give them cooler lunging abilities .

Vega :) Shenanigans :) Hilarity . I r excite . :))) 
Usually sleep helps with my anxiety . Not today . Working 4-CL . 
I'm beat . At least it's CbN Friday and I have something to look forward to . Work 12-7 . C'mon OT ;) 
I HAVE THE DAY OFF TOMORROW . I am going to savor every second of it . And then the one after that . CbN , I love you . You don't even know . <3 
I have a really bad headache . D: 
Holy boredom Batman . 
:) 
I think I'm catching the head cold going around . Luckily , I do not have to work my entire closing shift today . I got a serious amount of rest as a result . I'm super excited for Saturday to get here . ^.^ 
Sometimes I get my hopes up , even though they're likely to get crushed . I suppose history will just have to repeat itself this time . Off to close at work . I'm thankful it's only three hours . 
There is something to be said about this house , and my monumental love for it . Additionally , I have a great appreciation for my own desk , PC , excellent speakers with a grand selection of music , my own comfortable bed and space , and the sanity it restores . Right now it's as if I can handle any and everything life will present me . I've got some truly amazing friends and family - without them , I would surely be lost .

Wow . 
So many positive changes this week . I'm extremely excited . I'm off work early and I have two days off :) Getting a nap , I really need it but I don't know if I can sleep . 
Had a really great evening . I'm really tired . It's Saturday and I have plans of awesome . 
\So if you care to find me ! Look to the Western Sky ! As someone told me lately ... everyone deserves the < PROPMALE > to fly ! \"" 
I have never been so fucking confused in all my life as I was tonight .

CbN tonight makes me a happy girl . :) 
Holy hell , that scene in House just scared the living shit out of me . I'm fucking terrified right now . :( 
Scion Tonight . Scary day at work tomorrow . 
Life never requires changes you aren't strong enough to make . 
I have lactic acid buildup in all of my muscles and it hurts . I'm hungry and didn't have time to eat all day . The result of those two things is a very whiny Mojo . Tomorrow is the wonderful Heartland Alliance , and lil ' Miss Pressley's birthday party . Despite my aches , those two things excite me greatly . 
Yesterday exceeded my expectations . Not only was I able to challenge for rank , I did so successfully . ( Note : Metis was first to rank . Oh man , there's gonna be trouble . ) Four compliments on my role play during noms . Warp Pipes are tasty win . I feel so good about myself right now , you don't even know . I'm really loving the friends I've made since finding Vega . 
I have such high hopes for the Blue House . It doesn't seem like there will be much to hinder future plans except time and money , but that's always been the case but never what truly held us back . I feel really good about this . I can't wait to set up my shrine to the video game Gods :) < PROPFEMALE > . 
Every year around this time I break down . It never fails . I feel as alone now as I did then . I hate Halloween , and I hate the beginning of November . 
Much better today . And I don't have to work . 
Not enough money to get my car fixed , and I got 800 messages today I should have gotten yesterday . * sigh * At least tomorrow is CbN Friday , which improves my mood flawlessly , every single time I go . Maybe it's just Vega , but the two games I play in regularly and their respective ST's , do wonders for me . 
They never told you the price you would pay , for things that you might have done ... 
I remember it clearly . 
1 ) That right there , is a Revelation of a decade . 2 ) < PROPFIRST > Koch , what an amazing individual you are . 3 ) Use your brains . So mine isn't so loud and tired all the time .

Really hating myself today . Curling up behind a wall of music and hiding from everything . At least I have the day off tomorrow and should be able to do so all day . 
I had a dream last night , that Sears was going out of business . I caught them an hour before the final close , and bought a fancy new washer for $35 , a vacuum and a microwave for $20 , and huge green throw-type blanket that had a wolf on it for $5 . I understand the appliances , but where did the blanket come from ? I like my blanket .

Don't be crazy . I don't have room in my life for crazy .

The foundation of everything that's made me happy in the last several months has just been rocked . I can't for the life of me understand why you guys treat each other the way you do . 
Exhausted . Goin ' to bed early . Very much looking forward to Scion tomorrow . 
I draw my own conclusions because too often the ones others make are not sound . I would rather be who I am , than who you are . Third nightmare in a row , and I woke up super early , super cranky . I'm gonna find something and scream at it until I feel better . I doubt it will work , but at this point I'd have better luck with a brick wall than the actual person .

There are few ways for me to adequately describe the sheer brilliance that was Heartland Alliance today . Wow . 
Aww . The weekend is over :( 
I'm remarkably impressed with how long it's been since I've gotten sick . I'm sorry to hear so many people have been feeling under the weather lately . 
Sweet , I was going to challenge for that position weeks ago , but because the player never showed , now I'm not going to get the < PROPMALE > at all because of plot . * flips every table in her path * 
I have an idea . 
Aww , omg . That just made my whole day . 
Roughly 22 days left in 2010 . I'm feeling rather nostalgic today .

\Will you still love me tomorrow ? \"" 
2010 has given me countless reasons to smile . No trips to the ER in excruciating pain , time with my family , Vega , and a new job outside of food service . Today , I have one more reason , and it will probably last all the way through the ball drop . Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , everybody . <3 
\Freakin ' at the Freaker's Ball . \ " Happy New Year <3 " 
Whoa , I am unbelievably cranky . Do not like . Going to curl up in bed to see if it subsides . 
In Russia , High A hits you . 
\I wish the world was flat like the old days . And I could travel just by folding the map . \"" 
\Tastes like Magic in your mouth . \ " - < PROPMALE > ( ORLY . ) " 
I'm Game . \ 
Just for fun ! Pay it Forward 2011 :\ 
I promise to send something handmade to the first 5 people who leave a comment here . They must , in turn , post this and send something they make to the first 5 people who comment on their status . \ 
* The rules are that it must be handmade by you and it must be sent to your 5 people sometime in 2011 . 
In < PROPFEMALE>'s words , \I'm a being of incandescent rage . \ " I might be going to jail tonight . Where's a < PROPMALE > coat hanger when I mother f ** need one ?! " 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFIRST > . A little over four years . You are still missed . 
I have car insurance ! My room looks amazing and organized ! I am so very blessed to have the people in my life that I do . I never want to forget how wonderful this feeling is <3 
Wiiiiiickeeedddd XD 
It is my brother's birthday <3 I love him <3 
I see what you're trying to do , and it is not working . 
I'm getting my birth certificate tattooed so that I can't ever lose it . 
First day of orientation went well . Also , will get two days pay on Friday . What a wonderful situation I've found myself in . <3 
I'm not doin ' it . You can't make me . 
Two hours to get to work today . F * . Winter . 
Catching up on Castle , finishing Vampire Knight , and probably crashing really f*ing early like an old person . If I hear of anyone wishing for any more snow , I will end them . 
Mmm ... Intermediate Metis Gifts ... Want . 
I can't believe how exhausted I am . Also , I absolutely adore CbN . -Adore- it . Such an outstanding player base , and the ST's are incredible . -Incredible- , I tell you ! 
Dear Ms. R . C-er , you might have been correct , except that is not an FHA < PROPFEMALE > . Your 12-day-old trainees know that , and we've only learned CV . You can take your insulting reply with 5+ CC's of directors and team leads , and eat a < PROPMALE > . You are neither QC , nor our trainer , so bug off . 
I thought today was really going to suck , but then < PROPMALE > joined us in the first half of the day and everything was magically all better . YAY for 100% QC's! 
So my grandmother owned a house on Vega . 27 , something . There was a fire but I don't know the details . 
Frothing at the mouth in anticipation of tomorrow . <3 Heartland Alliance <3 
Work , sleep , larp , sample whiskey . <.< Wash , rinse , repeat . 
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart , I want to recognize your beauty's not just a mask , I want to exorcise the demons from your past , I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart . <3 
How do you choose between your head and heart ? 
Missing people that aren't with us anymore , missing family that are away , missing friends from out of town , missing friends in town that I don't get to see very often . Hating the weather . Loving my job . Hating the orders I was assigned today that were previously updated horribly . Feeling very torn , overall . 
Chicago by Night forums ... how I have missed you ! 
Can you imagine people talking about your last Facebook Status when you pass ? Welcome to the future ? 
Two days , ten hours . Pretend I whispered that to you creepily . 
Who wakes up to a flooded basement at 430 in the morning ? This girl . FML . * < PROPMALE > Sad Face * 
The Trumpet shall sound and the dead will be raised where the water meets the land . 
:'( 
Heartland Alliance , you are so the tits . 
Oh Saturday . What shall we do with you ? 
Oooo Shiny ... 
\Propensity . You like that word ? Propensity . \"" 
* pouts * 
I know it's been years , but I still miss the way mom held me when I was sick . :'( 
Dear Winter , the holidays are over , and nobody likes you . -Mojo 
Heartland Alliance FTW . 
Heartland Alliance Countdown : 13 days 8 hours 3 minutes . Maybe the only time you'll hear me say this : \Thank God we lost an hour . \"" 
\But when I wear a blowout protector I barely feel like I'm drilling . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > " 
I stand for the power to change , I live for the perfect day . I love till it hurts like crazy , I hope for a hero to save me . I stand for the strange and lonely , I believe there's a better place . I don't know if the sky is heaven , but I pray anyway . 
In this very moment I'm < PROPMALE > . 
My day was decent . I was released from training QC , but few of you probably know what that means . I assure you it's a good thing , and I was awarded two hours paid time off . I'm going to use it to attend CbN , because I missed it so much today . Not this week though . They require more advance notice than I have . 
Kiss me , I'm < PROPFEMALE > ! 
My heart hurts . Rest in peace , < PROPMALE > . I hope you can see now , just how much we loved you . 
Wope : Brought to you by South . :) 
Funeral , 2-4 . I feel like I'm going to be sick . 
I'm extremely fortunate to work where I do . 
I can imagine it , and that's what bothers me most . I can see the pain , the regret , the hesitation , the conviction , the loneliness , the insecurities , the fear , and the innocence . But on that day , he spared five families the heartache we feel . Five lives , for the price of one . Surely there exists strength to endure this . 
\She laughs at everything . She must have a good heart . \ " -PW . :) " 
I adore period dramas , but every time they execute someone in the Tudors I weep like a bitch . 
Babydoll rivals Wope . 
I abhor the last three days I've had . I blame the distinct lack of time to indulge in tasty Heartland Alliance RP's . Be still , my aching heart ! For Wyld Prophets is just beyond the horizon ... Methinks another countdown is in the making . 
Wyld Prophets :)
