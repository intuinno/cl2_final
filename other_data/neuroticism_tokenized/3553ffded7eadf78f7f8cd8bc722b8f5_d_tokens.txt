Why does it seem like every Cryptozoology ends up getting there own show ? 
Wow this quarter just sucks for everyone 
So ... school's closed and I'm locked out of my room ... boy this is going to make doing homework difficult 
the school has gone CRAZY with this pop tart thing !!! 
I want some shepards pie , meatloaf , hot dogs and potatoes , kielbasa and potatoes , pizza , a cheese bugger with bacon , onions and peppers , my mom's goulash and her slop , then a steak and then i want to finish it with some brownies ( of course ) . \ 
now I don't want them all in one sitting of course , but I would like to eat them all with in the next few weeks ! 
Writing scripts is such a pain !!!!!!!!!!!! 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > E . Guajardo for helping me with my Script , that thing can be really annoying . 
Hey just a friendly reminder to my crew of < PROPMALE > Oskowski , < PROPFEMALE > Foehl , < PROPFIRST > Watkins and of course < PROPFIRST > Nguyen ( because everyone needs a registered ninja ) . Shooting will start Thursday and consist of mainly the scenes in the dorms , thank you for your help ~ 
So in a single day my speech team are almost done with our speech , I was able to get my club idea approved by both my department head and the head of club activities , then got most of the shoots done for my DST class project and finished by meeting a 4 time Super Bowl Champ , 1 time Super Bowl MVP , Football Hall of Fame Member . So I think this classes as a good day . 
Ok , looks like I'm finally done with all the photos thank god lol . 
I seriously want to know who I ran into in the elevator on my way back to my place today and how come they knew my name but I couldn't recognize them ?!?! 
Jeez ... I really think I came down with a cold ... 
God I forgot how bad Nyquil taste ..... 
Just found out some of my 2D work was being shown in Styer's 2D animation class , hellz yea ~ I'm awesome ! 
I FINALLY found out a way to gross out my roommate < PROPMALE > Stevanus , and all it took was showing him my vain in my hand dance lol , and here I thought I wouldn't be able to gross him out . 
So my team of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Moorhead and our red headed dictator I mean < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and I finished our speech today and I've got to say not to shabby guys . lol 
Here's some math for all of you out there , 10 weeks ago this quarter started on a bumpy note for me , started with 4 classes and had to go down by 2 , but with in 9 days I wont have to deal with any of it , because I'll finally be back home relaxing on break . 
So at one of the biggest and most honorable award shows for a game designer this year , the British Academy Video Game Awards . Who turned out to be the big winner of the night , Mass Effect 2 , CoD : Black Ops ? Well turns out neither Heavy Rain was the big hit winning 3 awards . 
Thunderbilly made me food again . I'm so happy that I got such a good puppy dog lol . 
One week away , time to start the countdown ! 
Wow ... the 3DS just grows less and less impressive ... anywhere between 2-5 hour battery life , all the flaws with in it's 3D system , it's ' impressive ' ( sarcasm ) launch titles and the fact that it's capable of causing it's players to feel discomfort/sick feeling . Congrats Nintendo ! Sad thing is we all know it'll be the top selling hand held device . 
Wow so bored I actually edited my own profile ... the world MUST be coming to an end .... 
YAY ! spent the past few hours in the hospital with my sister and her friends , today was fuuuuun ~ 
There is a monster in my tummy , and he isn't happy . He keeps growling at me and demanding a sacrifice , I think I'll obey the monster who woke from his slumber , by a peace offering of Sloppyjoes 
This dang weather has gotten me sick again .... I hate colds ... 
Took an unsuspected shower today on my way back from the school , some may have hated it but i LOVED it ! lol 
Well I think I'll try to call it an early night and hope that I can get over this cold before break starts . =/ 
Sooooo been tossing around the idea and curious what others think , should I get contacts or should I stick with my glasses ? =/ 
ALMOST avoided all the hail , almost ... lmao 
So jeez , now that my baby brother finally cut his hair it has me thinking that I should do something with mine , any suggestions ? 
You know I was thinking , the pink and blue isn't a bad color combination for me , but it's the occasional yellow gunk that ruins it for me .... stupid pink eye ..... 
Soooo while I'm stuck here in th dorms my brother < PROPMALE > Lichtinger is walking around on the Colt's football field ... That lucky bastard !!!!
