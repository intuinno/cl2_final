Well thank you Ms. Brown , for making me take the orchestra placement text for next year even though I'm not going to do orchestra next year -__- its not like I am some immature child who always change their mind , Its so I can have room for what I really wanna be win I grow up- so yeah theres NO way I am changing my mind > < but you know .. whatever 
< PROPFEMALE > in itunes , theres that Genuis program that creates playlists based on your songs on your ipod and most of my songs that i like are in a playlist called \Brit Pop Mix\ " xD what does that mean ? British pop ? haha " 
Ewww I saw Ms. Brown ( the orchestra teacher ) and Mr. Collins ( that band teacher , right ? ) at 4 beans together . It looked like they were on a date O.o ... 
Just had a dream about a pokemon game , kinda like the DS ones- but like in 3D for a console system xD mann i wish it was real now :P

Stupid japan earthquake postponing the Pokemon Global Link ... I was really looking forward to trying out the Dream World this spring break > : 0 
hates being sick with a fever all day :( 
hates it when you get a pokemon team all figured out , then you realize that you really want a pokemon to know an egg move , so you have to go and find a male pokemon , raise it till it learns that move , then breed it to have the baby pokemon know that move , then you have to run around for the egg to hatch , then you have to raise that baby pokemon till it is the same level with the rest of your team ! \ 
/end nerd rant\ 
:P 
Just got back from Chicago ! The planetarium sucked xD some dude try to rip us off , and I was disappointed in the < PROPFEMALE > show . Shedd Aquarium & water tower place was pretty nice though ! :D
