“This is my wish for you : Comfort on difficult days , smiles when sadness intrudes , rainbows to follow the clouds , laughter to kiss your lips , sunsets to warm your heart , hugs when spirits sag , beauty for your eyes to see , friendships to brighten your being , faith so that you can believe , confidence for when you doubt , courage to know yourself , < PROPFEMALE > to accept the truth , Love to complete your life . ” 
weeee ! back to sleep for a bit ... housework ... laundry ... then off to apply for a 2nd job ! Watch out ... I'm on the move today ! :P

“May the love hidden deep inside your heart find the love waiting in your dreams . May the laughter that you find in your tomorrow wipe away the pain you find in your yesterdays . ” 
Made it thru work with lots of energy to spare ! what to do ... who ... I mean WHAT to do ... hehehehe

Dear Fathers : never tell your kids that your love and support of them is interchangable with money . Its not . A parent's love should be unconditional , no matter your differences in opinion or personality . Saying that is a great way to fuck up your kids and make them feel worthless . so thanks for that dad . 
Is sick again . :-/ can I just get my tonsils out now ?? stupid insurance wnats $1500 for a deductable ! greedy bastards ! I think the insurance cos like keeping people sick , so they can < PROPFIRST > up the prices on the meds that we need . well .. assuming we need them ... not like the pharmacudical cos have produced any cures ! just ways to hide symptoms . grrrrrrr

Change has a considerable psychological effect on a person . To the fearful it is threatening because thing could get worse , to the hopeful it is encouraging because things could get better , to the courageous it is inspiring because the challenge exists to make it better . 
Anyone know a good , affordable family lawyer ? We have some custody battling to do plus a forged signature on the custody agreement .

A luxurious body treatment utilizes the powerful antioxidant and exfoliating properties of the grape . Do you think this is a good special to run for the fall season ? 
Please vote for what you think sounds better . These are all body wraps : Chocolate Truffle , pumpkin cream , Mango , Hungarian Chocolate , Sweet Red < PROPFEMALE > Hip
