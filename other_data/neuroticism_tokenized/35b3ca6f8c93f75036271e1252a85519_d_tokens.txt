Have you ever wondered if those so called \color blind\ " people are actually the ones that see what everything looks like ? I mean how do I know that the grass is truly supposed to be green and that pumpkins are supposed to be orange ? "

Senior year orientation tomorrow . Just think it'll be my last high school orientation EVER . 
Senior year should be pretty easy .

Oh my gosh !! I was about to go to bed until i saw this spider on my dresser . The same one as this morning .

Answer my message ! the anxiety kills . 
is so bored .... 
The volunteer orientation was fun . I go for training on saturday . 
has no idea how she is going to go to bed earlier than she has been . I like heading for been at 3 a.m. :( 
Dang !! Almost thought there was a tornado ! Thats how < PROPFEMALE > it is here . I think i hear hail too ! 
How selfish can one person be ? One day people that try and disappear from my life will regret it . One day those that don't talk to me enough to know me will regret it . 
Training tomorrow ! Should be fun .
