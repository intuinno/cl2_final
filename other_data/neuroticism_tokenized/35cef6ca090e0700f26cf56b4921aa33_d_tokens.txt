Believe me when i say im in every single memory that we collect together , oh its true , and you want to touch me , want to see me in person , so close your eyes and dream away . 
I guess its luck but its the same , hard luck you been trying to tame , maybe its love but its like you said , love is like a role that we play , but i belive in you so much , i could die for the words you say . 
Sorry , I will never accept myself for who i really am .

No matter what anyone says , looks do matter , if you say they dont , your lieing . 
In the end , we only regret the Chances we didnt take , the Relationships we were afraid to have , and the Decisions we waited to long to make . 
comment my pics (: 
Jerk !. 
People will do alot for the things/people they love and care about . 
Sometimes , its not as simple as forgetting it . 
I tell myself that I will never be good enough , because i don't want to get hurt when im actually not good enough .

Wasting all my life looking down into this wasteland where nothing can be found . 
Jus got home from nicoles house . i love that chick <3 
Move forward and Take it one step closer , Take it back now , and do it all over .

I can prove that i can be stronger , or at least ill die trying . 
Happy easter ! 
My heart beats for the simple things like the sun breaking through the clouds , right before its about to storm , when the thunder is loud . 
My diet coke is watered down , thanks to the melted ice . siggh veryy gross . oh well im still gonna drink it (: 
And the sun will set for you . And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in gray , and the sun will set for you .

my tummy hurtss . 
Running on empty , and dont know where to turn . 
Your eyes are the soundtrack of my summer . 
Its sad how pointless i see life as now . 
its really amusing to me that my internet says its disconnected , yet ive been able to use it all day . 
I hate everything about you , why do i love you ? hold me when i start to think about you , i know , only when you stop to think about me do you know , i hate everything about you , why do i love you ? you hate everything about me , why do you love me ? i hate you hate i hate you love me . 
My laptop jus fails all together -____- now i have a virus . Fuck school laptops and their shitty anti-virus protection shit that dont fuckin work . 
Well , you suck . \

Going to stupid banddddd . then to nicoles daddys house for the weekend (: i love < PROPFEMALE > Masters and < PROPFEMALE > Riggs . They my girlies <3 (: 
Im tired , my tongue hurts , and i do not wanna go to school tommarow .

Its sad that i have to look at a picture , jus to see how i really look . 
hey , your stupid <3 
I'm Sorry . 
I have the hiccups . And they hurt . 
If only you knew about everything ive gone through , most of it was my fault , but that doesnt me it didnt largely affect me , my way of thinking , my life , and so on . So maybe , the next time you ignore me , or say something rude , or give me \that look\ " . You might want to think about what i just said . " 
You have three choices in your life . 1 . Give up . 2 . Give in . or 3 . Give it your all . What will you choose ? 
Sometimes , I wish that more people would like me . But then again , why would i want to be friends with superficial bitches ? 
Do not enjoy blacking out in the middle of the hall at 4am and i do not enjoy being sick . 
Sometimes i feel like some of the people i care most about dont even want anything to do with me anymore . 
When you hurt someone enough , itll stop hurting them . Yeah right , it always hurts . 
reeses puffs <3 
\Tell your boyfriend if he says hes got beef that im a vegetarian and i aint fuckin scared of him ! \"" 
Everyone tells me im like a little kid , cuz i can never not be doing something with my hands . and im like always moving haha oh , and when you give me a pen or mechanical pencil , i will find a way to take it apart (: 
I want to cut my hair short . 
Boring first day of summer . Night everyone .

Beginning to realise whos important to have in my life , and who i don't necissarily need in my life anymore . 
Figured out what ima do for my political cartoon . Maybe . Needta study for the unit test tho . Yuck . 
When you really want to do something , you'll find a way to do it , no matter the consequences it will bring you . When it really isn't that important to , you'll find all the excuses possible . 
\And who do you think you are\ 
\I'm falling apart 
\Open your eyes\

Jus finished my english essay . Which turned out pretty shitty . but eh its a shitty subject so it aint my fault . now jus waiting lol . 
\And suddenly I become a part of your past\ 
To be honest , it doesnt matter what other people WANT for me or what other people THINK is best for me . I know myself the best , and what matters is what I KNOW is the best for me and what I WANT for myself . 
I wanna go to sleep . But I dont think i'd wake up till like 10 . I'm just so exhausted . Im tired of stupid routines . 
October\ 
is cancer month : In memory of every cancer patient , family member and \ 
friend who has lost their battle with cancer and in honor of those who \ 
continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who \ 
has or had cancer . 
I can't think of anything to say at the moment . So , hm . Goodnight neverland . 
\If everyone cared and nobody cried\ 
Halloween costumes ? Damnn ,, what should I be ? (: 
Waiting for < PROPFEMALE > Masters and her daddy to come get me and < PROPFEMALE > Riggs for a girls weekend we need one (: And listening to ' Sellout by Nevershoutnever . ' I really don't care if you don't like him . I dont like his fans ( At All ) But his lyrics have a meaning and make his songs really worth listening to . 
I love you < PROPFEMALE > Masters and < PROPFEMALE > Riggs , even tho you guys team up and try to prove me wrong all the time :p \ 
Fun weekend though , < PROPFEMALE > likes to attack me . but shes so cute and little . My second daddy bought me a new camera (: But we all had the MOST AKWARD/embarrasing talk ever haha thanks for putting me on blast < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > :p 
You may not understand the actions i take . But one day every weird/silly/stupid/funny action i take , ima look back and laugh at people who were quick to judge me for it . And jus say damn , im happy i did that shit . 
Nothings ever built to last .. 
I don't know who i wanna be , what i wanna do , or where im going in life . But one day im gonna figure that out . And im gonna be better off than you . 
Life is going to move on and keep going . Maybe this ending opened up a new beginning ? 
Accept me for who I am and what i'm not as well . And if you can't do something as simple as that , why do you need to be in my life ? 
Weird day today but pretty alright . < PROPMALE > with < PROPFIRST > then had to do shit then ate taco < PROPFEMALE > then took davey home . Then went to target and the Halloween store next to it (: 
Stressed , Frustrated , Tired , Annoyed , Pissed off , And Exhausted . Band at 5 please go away . Football game tommarow please go away . Saturday , Hurry up . 
Trying my hardest to stop stressing over everything . I jus need to chill the hell out . 
Band .. Sigh go away . It's cold and raining and I'm tired an I jus want to go to sleep . Why can't < PROPFIRST > cancel it ? 
I need some change for the good in my life . 
\One night you were so drunk that you said you could be with me forever\ 
The sacrifice is never knowing why I didn't walk away . 
Nothing to do today , so .. Like this status & i'll tell you :\ 
1 . something i learned about you by staring at your wall for 10sec \ 
2 . the color you remind me of \ 
3 . my 1st memory of you \ 
4 . the animal you remind me of .. \ 
5 . ask something i've always wondered\ 
6 . my favorite thing bout you \ 
7 . give you a weird nickname \ 
8 . challenge you to repost :) 
I'm curious as into where my life is gonna take me . I'm gonna do what I think is best for myself no matter how much people disagree or don't approve . If it's what I wanna do and think is right for myself then why do I need anyones approval ? 
Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but i know that my friends will be the 3% that do . Post this for at least for an hour , in honor of those who have died of cancer or are fighting it . 
Who's wearing their costume tommarow ? 
Had a good time with the girls today (: I love you Brittany&Nicole . Goodnight facebook . 
GSFC all day . I rather be using my time for something more time worthy . Bleh I'll make through the day tho . 
Woke up and ate cookies instead of an actual breakfast haha wow >.< 
Had a good day with my loves , nicole&brittany (: Happy Halloween everyone . Goodnight . 
Band hurry up and end . Pleasee ? 
After november , I'm gonna live life for myself . I'm not going to live to make other people happy anymore . I don't know if it makes sense to anyone else , but living to please others makes no sense to me at all , and i'm jus not gonna put up with it anymore . 
I look back at all the people I use to be friends with and actually cared about me . And now i'm not friends with 3/4s of those people and they honestly don't care about me or what I do anymore . But i'm okay with that because all that bs has made me stronger and has made me who I am today , whether people like it or not . 
This week has been weird and should just end already . 
\If only I knew I was dead wrong all along \ 
Not feeling very good&Not looking forward to the next three weeks or so . 
So , My chemical romance isnt coming to cali for anyone tour dates on their 2011 tour . :( 
I feel as if i totally just wasted my day i dont like that -__- 
Had a fun day yesterday with Davey < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > . (: It was fun , most fun ive had in awhile ha .

\You say 
Time is a poison . Once we've drank it all , we'll die . So sip it slow , take it easy , and enjoy every drop . 
School laptops suck -___- I haven't been able to use the Internet since like Wednesday on it . 
With every blink of an eye the world you see around you is changing . 
We all wake to the human condition . We wake to mystery and beauty but also to tragedy and loss . Millions of people live with problems of pain . Millions of homes are filled with questions – moments and seasons and cycles that come as thieves and aim to stay . We know that pain is very real . -TWLOHA 
Well , Marching season has come to an end . Its been long , hard , and stressful . But look , we've made it through . Our championships place was a bit disappointing , but hey , it was my best show of the whole year , and many others as well . So keep your head held high , there's more to life then high school&band . 
Still have homework to doo D: 
Stick to your guns&sleeping giant , damnn ! Great show . Definatly in the top 1 or 2 places aha . Now gonna shower and sleep and hope I wake up in the morning for school ha . 
Off to Fresno in a bit . Then I'll be back tomorrow night . 
type your name : < PROPFEMALE > Reeley\ 
with your elbow : m , edrfsazgbhhhjaszjhnm refedredlk . edrfyt6\ 
With your nose : m3qatyqhhhhhhhhhb r4e3e3o3e6\ 
With your eyes closed : meaghan reeley\ 
Put this as your status , and don't erase any mistake 
Reading through all my statuses this year . Wow i was a very depressed&angry person until very recently . Kinda adds on to my wakeup call . 
Peoples stupidity&lying cracks me up ha . Whatever . Goodnight all .

Let's see how creative my facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy ' cause that's no fun . 
Happiness is something that comes into our lives through doors we don't even remember leaving open . 
\It's so pathetic you care so much 
Be yourself . Be werid . Be awsome . Be Stupid . Be funny . Make mistakes . Be scared . Grow up . Don't get to caught in the past . Look forward to the future . Find your purpose in life . To be blunt , don't go out&get fucked up out of your mind on whatever the fuck all you do . Don't do shit thats going to mess up your chances in life . But then again , why do i give a shit , be my guest&fuck up your life just dont drag me into it (: 
Had an awesome weekend at nicoles dads house . Now back to school in the A.M. 
I want to feel like&know im gonna have a steady future . But as of now i know nothing . 
Heros are made when you make a choice . 
Tell me i'm selfish . Tell me i'm a bitch . Tell me i'm a loser . Tell me i'm a lier . Tell me your better then me . Tell me i'm not going anywhere in life . Talk to me in 2 1/2 years&see where i am . Watch how much better off i am than you . Then try to tell me your better than me & that i'm not gonna go anywhere . 
' If it happens it happens and I'll be the same\ 
Can't hold back on the choices I made that day\ 
I've come to accept\ 
The things that I see\ 
I've read every word , every line , everything\ 
Just say what you will\ 
Just tell me I'm scared ' 
' That's when she said I don't hate you boy\ 
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save\ 
that's when I told her I love you girl\ 
but I'm not the answer to the questions that you still have ' 
' I lie here shaking on this bed , under the weight of my regrets \ 
I hope that I will never let you down \ 
I know that this can be more than just flashing lights and sound \ 
look around and you'll see that at times it feels like no one really cares ' 
I realised i'm kinda like a really hateful person at times . But the hate i have towards most of humanity i don't share with many people . 
People who act like someone their not bug the shit outta me . 
Anybody in Track : Are we supposed to wear the sweatshirt and the sweatpants tommarow ? Or can we just wear the Sweatshirt ? 
I realised that i dont hate them . I hate what they did to me . I hate how i was treated . I hate what they called me and what they tried to say i did . 
\I stare at our picture\ 
Take me back to how it use to be . That's all I ask . 
I know i always say i don't care what people say about me or think about me . But thats a lie . I do care&i hate when people feel like they have any right to judge me . I hate being stereotyped as something im not . Someone i never was&never will be . Im real . Im not living a lie anymore . Im being true to myself and im not gonna let anyone stop me from making myself happy and my life worth living . 
\It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten\
