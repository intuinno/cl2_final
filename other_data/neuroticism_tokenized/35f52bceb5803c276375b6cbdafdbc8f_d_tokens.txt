thinking about coyotes and the good old iforce v8 on a toyota tundra . it's just one of those days . 

HONDA Accords have good A/C's! 
RIP < PROPMALE > Winn 
Ahhh , gotta love the Goldstar Bridge . Groton on one side , New London on the other . Six < PROPFIRST > s of crossing , weaving , slamming , and jamming . No one is in the proper < PROPFIRST > . And Yamaha motorcycles doing 90 damn near bouncing off your bumper . They come in a blur and it's a team of ten or more ... It's 55 damnit !! 
They merge on from either 32 North in New London or New London Frontage Roads , cross over six lanes to exit 86 ( left exit mind you ) for route 184 . Yet I still remained obsessed with that bridge . 
Use that bridge every time I go to the my Gramp's cottage . ( except if I take route 2 straight home by the casino and through Norwich . ) 
< PROPMALE > Jeter is the man . 2,272 hits ! 
big NFL day tomorrow . packers play the bears . psyched . 
good . read 40 pages of poly sci journals last night . now watching giants redskins . road my bike on the mansfield hollow trail today after work . packers start at 8:15 . 
Glad to have this Monday in the books . A new thing went wrong every hour . Should yield a halfway decent Tuesday . 
Inksell owes me 60 bucks . They sold me the wrong ink . Hopefully the post office will cooperate when I return this crap . 
my weekend commences NOW ! 
happy birthday to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > roth 
RIP < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
my rabbit just prankcalled me ! 
i one day plan on buying out kmart and making it better ... 
California's alright , somebody check my brain 
is in love ... but is she in love with me ?... that's the real question . 
public enemies was the most overrated movie this summer . it insults really good ganster and mob films like the godfather , scarface , goodfellas , and casino . the scenes were shot way too dark , the camera angles made the action hard to follow , and the dialogue was difficult to hear for some reason . not a bad movie , but it hums to the tune \overrated . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > christmas ! 
quitting smoking for the third time in my life today . if my motivational posts annoy you , don't read them . today is day zero . last cigarette smoked was at 9:00 PM ( Pall Mall Blue standard filter ) 
< PROPMALE > g , the < PROPFIRST > mcdonald of music , makes music videos that keep me up at night ... 
Went to see < PROPFEMALE > in Chains at the MGM Grand with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Ridgeway . Awesome , topnotch performance . The new AIC is like the AIC of old !!! I love the new frontman too ! 
didn't realize what a great song \nutshell\ " was from < PROPFEMALE > in chains until he heard it live . now i am slowly learning the acoustic part . " 
3.141592654 .......... 
Just bought a Squire Bronco Bass ... Pretty good bang for the < PROPMALE > . 
you know it's a good day when you pick up your bass guitar at 2 and then look at the clock again and it's 5 . you know it's a really good day when you pick up your acoustic guitar at 6 and it's now 9:59 . 
lithium kills . nuff said . 
i saw my first 2011 hyundai sonata on the road yesterday at 10:55 AM on route 5 in East Windsor pulling out of the Sunoco station . This is significant because the 2011 sonata is a new generation in the series . Hyundai continues to improve their quality , and i am beginning to think they are the new Honda . 
if everyone is sick , just drink water . i have not taken a sick day since 2005 . ( mental health days are personal days ) . \ 
~ pz . 
Like this if you think Aenima from Tool is one of the most interesting albums of the 90's . Undertow was good too by the way . 
black and white\ 
are all i see\ 
in my infancy\ 
red and yellow then came to be\ 
reaching out to me\ 
let's me see . 
got to stop listening to tool songs b4 i go to work . i'll have this one in my head today . \ 
\angels on the side line baffled and confused .... monkey killing monkey killing monkey killing monkey killing monkey on the ground .... \ " goes something like that . " 
hmmmm . what was more fun today ( yesterday) ? cleaning main/crackaxle with Markie J . Bedus or having a 1am discussion with < PROPMALE > Myers-Durocher about high frequency radiation ? 
SPIRAL OUT , KEEP GOING\ 
SPIRAL OUT , KEEP GOING ............................................. 
i consider myself very lucky to have gone on the great american scream machine last month as they closed it down two days ago . in my opinion , that was the best upside down roller coasters i've ever been on . 
time is going by really weird and i feel strangely detached ..... 
to all you people out there who get overlooked for being mediocre : you're the best ! i hope you know who you are . 
why does everyone bitch about mcc parking ? never had any issues . and if you don't want to get stuck in traffic exiting on hillstown road , use wetherell st or bidwell st. 
I am a lot like severus snape . 
i beg for you .. ohhh you know i beg for you/ pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine/take a bath i'll drink the water that you'll leave/ if you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend/ pick a flower , hold your breath and drift away <3 
thinking about you ... 
even when others don't , god understands . knowing that , i'll be able to sleep well tonight . and i won't hold a grudge either ...... :) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is my favorite bass player all of a sudden . 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish\ 
for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease\ 
nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but \ 
ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you \ 
......... make it your status for ... at ... least one ...... hour ? ....? Promote LOVE & Acceptance , not hate 
i bought my camry a year ago from today . the odometer read 78,256 . one year later it reads 103,603 . 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I\ 
know 97% will not post this as their status , only 3% wil do this but i \ 
hope u r one of them and put this as their status , at least for an hour , \ 
in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
can't wait for tomorrow ! voting for the first time ! 
i knew the cowboys would meet this fate eventually . go packers !!! 
sorry , professor . shakespeare is really boring . it put me to sleep last night after five pages and i woke up very well rested ten hours later . the blinds were open and all the lights had been left on . 
going to see < PROPMALE > potter today with my love , < PROPFIRST > Tipton ! :) 
i want a 2011 Ford F-150 with ECOBOOST !!! 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
So far it's been an awesome birthday and it's only five hours old . Gotta work a half day 11-3 , and I guess my birthday present from God is the fact that the blizzard won't start until 3 . At least that is what God told weather.com 
Tonight's performance from Rodgers and the Packers was one of a kind ! I loved how at the end of the game there were all cheeseheads in the stands and all the falcon fans had gone home . One week at a time boys ! 
packers 24 - steelers 21 in super bowl XLV 
In the summer of 2008 , there was never any doubt in my mind that < PROPFIRST > Rodgers would eventually lead the Packers to a Superbowl victory . This years team had amazing depth and had a very prolific offense . Go Packers ! 
my camry needs a new oxygen sensor . thank god it is just the rear one . if it was the MAF one in the front , i'd be broke . 
Wow . Even though < PROPMALE > st has narrow lanes , they seem wide with the snow banks almost gone 
NASCAR is not my sport . the only NASCAR i watch is the last 10 laps of Daytona . today i will watch the last 100 laps or so of Daytona because I want to see the newly paved track . 
Got a lot of shit thrown at me today but I handled it < PROPFIRST > Rodgers style . 
this year i plan on putting at least 2000 < PROPMALE > on my bicycle . i have not ridden that much since 2006 , but it is time i get back to my old ways . 
i love how facebook is trying to sell me steroids in the side ads . 
no matter how many times i listen to lateralus , the next time i listen to it is always an even deeper spiritual experience . after owning the album for 10 years , i have still not gotten sick of it , or even uncovered all of its complex layers . 
Just read an interesting article : Facebook may make depression worse in depressed people , but is a great resource for socially adjusted people . 
i could sure use a vacation from this ... stupid shit , silly shit ... LEARN TO SWIM , LEARN TO SWIM , LEARN TO SWIM ............................
