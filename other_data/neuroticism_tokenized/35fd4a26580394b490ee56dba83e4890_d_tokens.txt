Alensana will eat the world ... and bleed it back out ^_^ 

I'm running out of O-X-Y-G-E-N 
I'm tired and scared and I want to go home but home is eating my brain 
I have a headache and the doctor's doin ' all the damage 
It's only my flesh that's making the water cold 
That < PROPMALE > was talking to me for a second ... I swear 
WHY DOES THE DRUNK BASTARD HAVE TO SHOOT THE FLAMING ARROWS AT ME WHEN THE APPLE IS ON HIS HEAD 
My spirit is willing but my flesh is weak , my eyelids grow heavy and I might just fall asleep ... 
< PROPFEMALE > , Saint < PROPFEMALE > ... you can't leave this world behind 
I'm gonna go out and see a movie ... or rather , watch a movie at home with my friends ... or rather , by myself .... or rather , be by myself wishing I was watching a movie ... yeah ... pass the fucking popcorn 
This would be a good time to sink to the bottom of the pool and stay there 
I hope they all die and count on me to bury them . 
It's an eruption of madness , and there is no pill you can take for it 
Once you're a thought , hopefully you're forgot 
Let the rain fall down , let it fall to the ground , Let the rain fall down to the ground . And the birds don't sing , no they don't make a sound , When you're six feet underground . 
I am soon to see the ghost that had haunted me almost my whole life , you remember < PROPFEMALE > , he choked us and hurt our arms , but now we need him dear , there is an angel trying to hurt us now . 
THE ANGEL IS DEAD ! GATHER THE TOWN FOR THE ANGEL IS DEAD ! 
I am the mistake , the worst you'll ever make . 
BREEEEEEEEE !!! BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!! 
< PROPFIRST > TALENT IS GONNA ROCK TONIGHT !!! 
< PROPFIRST > TALENT TOTALLY ROCKED !!! AND I MET THE FRICKIN DRUMMER !!! ^_^ 
The dream in which I was dieing was the best I ever had 
I'm never at home in this world 
I pulled the knife half-way out ... I'll live for another day 
This place sucks 
When are you REALLY COMING HOME ? My dress is burned , my heels are split and guess what , this place is shit . 
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain 
That God damned smell nearly drove me more insane than I was already expected to be ... lavender never put me under good light 
Keep a calender this way you will always know the last time you came through 
No , I think not , it's never to become for I am not the one ... then again , I could be lieing to myself 
I can't take this , No , I don't like it 
I LOVE MARLEY AND < PROPMALE > !!! THANK YOU AUNTIE < PROPFEMALE > FOR LETTING ME HAVE THEM FOR A FEW WEEKS !!! [= 
Am I suppose to be happy ? All I ever wanted comes with a price 
OH ! This isn't where I parked my car !

You can yell words as loud as you want , precious child , but is someone listening to you ? That makes all the difference . 
I need to take a walk ... my eyes hurt from crying

I play ring around the ambulence like I never gave a care <3 
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enimies and all the lovers with no time for me ... 
I feel alseep in my last class today and didn't even hear the < PROPFEMALE > ring >_> 
The lonely loner seems to free her mind at night 
Lips and teeth to ask how my day went ... boots and fists to pound on the pavement 
I don't want to alarm you , but this would be a good time to run for your life ... it's slipping away , run for it , run after it . 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now
