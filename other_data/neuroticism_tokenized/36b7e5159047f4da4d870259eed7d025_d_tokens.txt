My mom got me a cute < PROPFEMALE > card and a b-day donut with chocolete and sprinkles , and a few lovely friends wished me a happy b-day !

About an hour ago my home felt like it would fall like a deck of cards , but now it's peaceful .

I dreamed of cysts , because my mom and I were watching pimple and cyst popping on PopThatZit.com . I believe I'm weird .

She found 13 reasons why : Low blood pressure , Thyroid problems , Anemia , Hypoglycemia , Raynaurd's , Anorexia , Schizophrenia , Hypothermia , Dermatitis , Cardiogenic Shock , Hypovolemic Shock , and Peripleral Disease . The most realistic is Low blood pressure ; her BP is under 100/80 , cuz she has barely moved since 2004 .

It's the Final Four ! Go Butler & Duke !!! 
it's been a Hoopy Easter Break , but school is tomorrow :(

HATES when my mom naps . You know the saying : when the cat is away the mice are out to play . Now , imagine that except with children antagonizing each other .

found out that our apartment has broken sinks , toilets , and tub . My mom calls the office & they send out a worker to fix our toilet . Did I say fix ? If you mean fix by flooding my mom's bathroom , closet , and the rest of the building , then yes . So , my mom , the workers , & I are still trying to fix everything . It gets better : my mom got shocked 2x's by a wet electrical outlet & the workers have jumbo fans .

enjoying the first day of finals by watching a black and white cat . As I went to check out the cat , it hid itself from me by flattening itself and stealthly escaped to the balcony on which it lives ; later it returned to the roof , but I wasn't there . Cats hate me because smother them with love , but at least I'm not like my four-year old neighbor who grabs their kitten by it's neck while one-handedly scootering .

is hyper . My mom's friend told her to try this ORAC-Energy Greens ( the whole pack has 24 servings of fruits/veggies ) , but we only had a 1/4th of a pack mixed with Powerade ( yah-cuz that will make it better ) .

says , \does anyone remember the Dinosaurs TV series ? \ " I used to love that show ! It was on from 1991-1994 and it had the best stories ever ! I remember this one time when the bady went Emo ( cut itself ) to get attention & another time when the father gave his boss pot for a present . That is awesome TV !!!! "

Thats like a Freshman Football team playing a Senior Football team : first of all they have 3+ extra years of experience & any they are HUGE . So , I'm thinking this will definitely go well & no one will get hurt . Right , Right-Total BS .

Oh wait , I know it's the helecopter parked over our appartment ( Riverbends in Yorba < PROPFEMALE > ) and the police with guns drawn looking for something or someone . Luckily , there is news ; oh right , no one cares ... 
feels it has been an eventful weekend ( B-days , police chases , fires , arguments , & more ) , but Monday gets interesting with a car crash of my brother's classmate ; luckily , everyone is ok .
