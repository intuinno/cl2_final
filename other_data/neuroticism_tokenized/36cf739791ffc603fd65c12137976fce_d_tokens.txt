If you're a new friend I may not know , please introduce yourself . 

So excited to see < PROPMALE > Maher , I could just pee . 
I am appalled to hear that a 6 year old was Baker Acted , against her parent's wishes , and made to stay overnight in a mental hospital . Really ?! 
So far , I'm on track with school work . I have a paper due Sunday that may give me trouble but I'm gonna try ! 
Sometimes , I think the people in my classes are slightly mentally off . How any of them graduated high school , much less are attending college , is beyond me . One woman debated with me about the < PROPFEMALE > Schiavo case . She seems to be under the uneducated impression that Mrs. Schiavo is still alive . :( 
Went to the flea market and then the Turkish festival today , now it's time for homework at Panera .
