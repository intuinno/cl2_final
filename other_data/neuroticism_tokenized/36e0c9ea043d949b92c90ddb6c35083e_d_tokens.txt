#732 yo whats goody ... you know that you were annoying the whole time i've known u in college and your foot fetish was definitely the joke of the century but u still halfway decent ... when you gonna hit me up about dancing in one of ur videos ... lmao ...

LOVE YOU !!! 
Sorry to inform you but im not playing the < PROPFIRST > game no more so allyuh could stop inboxing me now !!!! 
I hate last minute changes .... feeling under the weather ... 
soooo ... its really snowing and the temperature is going below freezing ... im already getting sick ... this is not a good look !!!! 
I Love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > - keyana x3 . 
BLIZZARD !!!!!!!!!!! 
Spent 2 days stuck in the house with my crazy little cousins , KeyAna < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > ' Dimesz ' Roach ... so over it !!!!!! Luckily Telecia < PROPMALE > was there to save my sanity !!!!! 
finally made it home and nyc is slowly coming back to normal .... back to work !!! gotta make that money baby lol ...... hurry up and come back , \ 
Docter Kyron < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!! 
Wishing a very happy birthday to one of the few people I hold dear to my heart . Happy Birthday Gabby Elle ... I will continue to be here for you whenever you need me !!! LOVE YOU !!! 
is it true that people break up before < PROPFIRST>'s Day just so that they don't have to buy presents ??? more power to those who push through it all !!! 
On my wall there is a video titled < PROPFIRST > 6 , 2011 ... its a special performance with Precision at MY LITTLE COUSIN KEYANA'S SWEET 16 ( she's dancing too !!! ) Please give me some CONSTRUCTIVE criticism on the performance and/or specific people in it .... 
hoping to get a lot done this weekend but with so much to do ... who knows ?? 
whats really good with this winter new york ? this is getting outta hand !!!! 
on a mission .... grind mode .... 
its coming ........ 
Although sometimes a very big pain in the butt , she's the lil sis I never had . < PROPFEMALE > ' Dimesz ' Roach , I love u more than words could explain . HAPPY 17th BDAY !!! 2011 is the year 4 growth & maturity . Ill always b here 4 u & u kno that but now its time 2 actually listen 2 me . Keep ur head up & focus on ur goals , ur a beautiful & intelligent young lady , dont let anyone try 2 take that from u ! * bbm big hug * 
realizing that just because time is moving doesn't mean that people are moving with it ... i wish people would really grow up and make some sense of their lives , immaturity is such a headache .... lets all move progressively forward or else im going to have to start letting things/people go ... 
Why is it that when you feel your worse ppl still expect ur best or even more ? It's just not fair ... feeling very sick ...
