has just thought up the most delightfully wicked paper topic , and wonders if he'll still be excited about it in an hour . Hint : it involves nuns and phalli . 

Words on paper , finally . All of you people and your triumphant messages ... my sprint is just starting . I should be done by Tuesday , but it's very much the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise just now .

Christmas in Tennessee : moonshine-soaked cherries with the whole family . 
Because of Fourth Term Review , I now know that I have only written 162 pages of seminar paper since commencing grad school . 
I'm happy it can rain again in Michigan . After a while , water falling from the sky seems better when not crystallized . 
However I may feel about grad school , I do adore my advisor . She begins an email to inform us that she is stranded in Vienna with \I am the prisoner of a volcanic ash cloud . \""
