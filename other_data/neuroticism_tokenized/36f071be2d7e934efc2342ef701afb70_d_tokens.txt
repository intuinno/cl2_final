Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another . Instead , make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way . Romans 14:13 
Leviticus 6:12 -13 Dont let the fire die out . Keep your prayer life in check , we dont need 6000 teens , lights , a band , and altar calls to praise and worship the Lord God almighty . Many of us found the spark to light our fire for the first time , and some of us found the dry wood we were searching for to revive the fire that was close to dying out . we need to keep searching for dry wood to keep our fire strong . 
Everything God speaks to your life will come to pass , what will determinin its fullfilment will be your faith .
