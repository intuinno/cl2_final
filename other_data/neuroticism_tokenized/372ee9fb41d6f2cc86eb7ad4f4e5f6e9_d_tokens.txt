Urban Dictionary your name : A < PROPFEMALE > is someone who is omnipotent . A < PROPFEMALE > is gorgeous , intelligent , mysterious , witty , hilarious , out-going , creative and seductive , yet she is also tough , street-smart , experienced , brave , enduring , and mainly a wonderful mother . Nothing and nobody can compare to a < PROPFEMALE > in any aspect . Mess with a < PROPFEMALE > , or her family , and you will regret ever being born . 
Legally Blonde was decent . A bit corny and off the top at times , and the music was mediocre at best . It was mainly just a bunch of petty rhyming . 
With everything going so well , I'm afraid for the future . All good things must come to an end , however , when one door closes , another door opens . I just have to overcome my nature and keep looking beyond . 
Just helped a friend move . I'm exhausted . x_x 
No matter what I do , it will never be good enough . I revel in any success , small or big , making me seem conceited , because I never know when you'll demand more . I can't keep up ... I'm my toughest critic . 
Is probably the only person NOT looking forward to thanksgiving . Mediocre food with the part of the family I can't stand . Yay holidays !.... 
Small GSA meeting tomorrow after school in Ms. Freeborn's room . We'll be discussing future events and topics of upcoming meetings . Be sure to be there ! 
It's hard to escape the pain without losing yourself in the process . I can only hope the days run together until it's all just a memory ... a lesson for the future .

Anyone want to do something ? It's such a beautiful day to waste . 
Sausage and peppers = amazing dinner ! Too bad I wasn't very hungry ... 
Was up ' til 6am because of my stomach . :( 
I highly recommend anyone who loved Chicago to see the movie Nine ( not to be confused with 9 ) . 
They all tell me I'm going to be great ; that everyone will know my name . What if I don't want to be great ? What if I just want to exist and be happy ? 
I've been eating nothing but cheese , crackers , and salami . I feel classy . lol

< PROPFEMALE > Mulvihill is the nastiest skank bitch I've ever met . Do not trust her . She is a fugly slut ! 
And on the third day , God created the Remington bolt-action rifle , so that Man could fight the dinosaurs ... And the homosexuals . ( That means you < PROPMALE > Stawicki ) 
I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me ... but I can't help it that I'm so popular . 
Four for you < PROPMALE > Shapiro ! You go < PROPMALE > Shapiro ! And none for < PROPFEMALE > Cox ... Bye !

Is districts for girls still being held at < PROPMALE > ? 
Hopes it doesn't rain tomorrow . :\\ 
Wants to become < PROPMALE > , flavorful coffee . 
What time is silent dinner tonight ? 
Pull up yuh pants ! Yo < PROPMALE > looks like a god damn amputee ! 
Snap in , phase out , observe , participate , absorb , shut out . Always playing my part before the defenses crumble to nothing , only to be rebuilt in anticipation of the next attack . My seemingly fruitless search for the means to my existence which I am burdened with the freedom to create . Will the ends ever justify the means ? 
Would like to go to sleep one night this week without hearing moaning in the background ... 
Had the most incredible time at gay prom ! :DDD 
Life can be a bitch . :\\ 
Enjoy harassing him now bitches , because tomorrow I'm taking a copy of the FormSpring to the office . You messed with the wrong \faggots\ " . :D " 
It's too bad I didn't run for president , I may have required you all to wear rainbow uniforms because I'm such a \faggot \"." 
If I were Senior Class President , I would declare it be mandatory to have dildos on every bench , chair , and toilet because I'm such a flaming \faggot\ " . Oh and don't forget glitter ! I want lots and lots of glitter because I'm a crazy homosexual ! "

Enjoyed my first day of work . :) 
Pushed myself too hard at the gym . D: 
Just saw Mr. Wood at the gay pride parade in < PROPMALE > Manors !!! 
I don't know why I'm torturing myself by re-watching the 3rd season of the L Word . 
The only way to experience it is to understand pain but the only way to escape pain is to forget everything , especially what you \thought\ " you understood . You first have to make the choice : Is it worth forgetting ? " 
Wants to go to tennis camp >:( 
Leave it to < PROPMALE > and I to find a gayborhood wherever we go . 
Went to a church of Scientology with < PROPMALE > and we got our stress levels read with an e-meter ! Lmao

Got a new phone ! Please send me < PROPFIRST > ! 
Had a great time at Ren's party ! Happy birthday ! :) 
The evo keeps getting better and better ! 
:/ Food ... Why are you so annoying ? 
One step at a time , breath by breath , is how I should live my life . But when the future is constantly present , how can I find the time to both live and light my path for life ahead so I don't stumble upon what I was too slow to uncover . But then if I forsee the outcome , is it truly worth the journey ? 
For who could ever love a beast ? 
P1 . AP Micro/Gov Hon\

I won a three legged race all by myself . ;P 
I won't be another peasant . 
Was awake for about 40 hours and then slept for about 20 . 
At movie night with DECA . 
Going to visit UF today . :) Is it sad that I'm more excited about playing tennis with my cousin than visiting the school ? 
Hoping to gain some experience points tonight . Hope I don't regret it . 
Awesome party ! Don't know if I should be proud or disappointed in myself . But whatever I had fun . 
Miami Heat game with DECA 
Just letting everyone know I changed my name to first and middle for college purposes .

I love the feeling of having money in my pocket again . :D 
Candide gets turned on by scars .

How are you going to try to be a parent now , when I'm already grown and the parental skills you're using are the ones I taught you ? 
And see how you've brought beauty from ashes\ 
And made me as gold purified through these flames <3 
How did we meet ? COPY THIS TO YOUR STATUS AND SEE WHO REMEMBERS . 
I hate not knowing what I want , and it doesn't help when you're always telling me what I want . 
I can't even look at you , because all I see is me . It's time for me to be who I am and stop living for you . I want to form my own opinions and decisions without your influence . 
Scroooooge McDuck ! You silly little Capricorn Jew . ;) 
I HATE COLD ! D:< 
Now if only there were some way to bottle the essence of this chemically induced state of mind . Or perhaps , instead of looking for a container , I should just search for the source in myself , unblock the barrier , and let myself go . 
Slept in and am feeling much better . :) 
Wants to say something meaningful , but I think I'll just say \Goodnight\ " :) " 
I got my swype back ! 
It's amazing how long a week of not playing tennis feels . It feels more like a month ...

Who wants to see Cats with me ? 
Edit : Who wants a FREE ticket to see Cats with me ? It's a box , the very top box , but a box nonetheless . I have 2 extra tickets , though one is currently reserved for < PROPMALE > . 
Don't want to sleep because I'm scared of tomorrow ...

Baby give it up\ 
Give it up\ 
Baby give it up 
Had an awesome time seeing Cats last night with < PROPMALE > Lestat Stawicki and Sasheem Snell ! 
The more time I spend with them , the more the others look unnatural . Why must be so alone in this world ? 
I need to find a new gay friend who actually enjoys going shopping ... -_- 
Had an awesome time with the group at the Jetties ! Next time we should have a sleepover at < PROPFIRST>'s! 
Me : That there is an AILF\ 
Carly : An elf ? \ 
Me : No , an aunt I'd like to fuck . 
I think I found the cure ... 
The Real L Word is one of the most horrible , annoying shows I've ever watched . 
Worked 4 hours and now I have only 8/10 of my homework left . Cool ! 
43 days until UF releases admission statuses !

Oooh Canada ! 
Bahamas here I come ! 
Just got back from the cruise ! I won $340 , won the Blackjack tournament , and got a ton of new stuff ! 
It's called Vedic astrology , it's not new , it's a different version based on Sidereal astrology versus Western astrology ( what you are all familiar with ) which is based on Tropical astrology . Two different things using two different calculations and concepts to acheive a relatively similar idea . I'm still currently loyal to Western astrology although I'll do my research on the other . 
DECA Awards Ceremony . Uhg ... This is going to be a long night . 
Won third place in accounting ! Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday ! Love you all !

This month is changing fast from the best month of my life to most memorable month of my life . Hey bad stuff , please just wait 10 more days so I can blame it on February . D: 
I miss January :( \ 
February sucks ... 
< PROPMALE > Miserables was everything I hoped it would be . I'm so excited I finally got to see it . :D 
12 days ' til UF admissions decisions are released ! Oh the nerve racking agony . D: 
Hope seemed like the summer birds\ 
Too swiftly flown away\ 
Yet now I'm standing here\ 
With heart so full I can't explain\ 
Seeking faith and speaking words\ 
I never thought I'd say 
7 DAYS ! until UF relases their decisions 
Just played quidditch ! I'm the greatest seeker of the century ! Go Slytherin ! 
Playing tennis today !

To all of you Valentines Day Haters : I understand you may feel like it's a fake commercialized holiday , but why not take your own spin on it ? Don't have a partner to love ? Then aknowledge the other people in your life . Love a stranger , a neighbor , your friends , your family , and yourself . All of these people deserve to be appreciated . Why not devote this one day of love to them , rather than focusing on hate ? 
Tennis match against Northeast High !... And I can barely keep my head up . D: 
Got my ass kicked by Stoneman < PROPMALE > , but I played really well . And < PROPFEMALE > Springs High is not our \long time rival \"!"

Ate a sandwich that was sitting in a hot car for a few hours ... Uhg I'm stupid ...

Jacob : Would you touch a guy's < PROPMALE > if it were made of gold ? \ 
Me : Hell yeah ! I'd break it off and run ! \

Can everything just speed up or take a break ? I'm at my breaking point !

I wonder if I'll ever get stay in my own country for longer than just a brief visit ... It's been 18 years and I don't think I'll ever learn the language or completely understand the culture here . 
I never knew how fun balls could be . 
Palm beach pride today !

And see how you've brought beauty from ashes , and made me as gold , purified through these flames . \ 
< PROPMALE > <3 
\A man may fish with the worm that hath eat a < PROPMALE > and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm . \"" 
Senior cruise with < PROPMALE > Stawicki ! 
Back from my cruise ! 
Am I too rational to comprehend what is completely irrational , or is it irrational to believe that it is not at all rational ? Maybe it's a little of both , but either way I'm fucked . I'll have to work hard at either but it won't matter unless I've got someone working with me . 
8 points ! Oh gawd < PROPMALE > ... -_- 
Won my first match at tennis districts ( 6-1 , 6-2) ! Go Glades ! 
Won my second match ( 6-1 , 6-1) !

Don't you hate when good shit happens , but it's at completely the wrong time ? 
Lost , won , lost ! Placed 3rd ! Go Glades ! 
I love driving far out of my way to turn around and drive right back . Thanks mom ... 
Having people in your life who you love and can trust and who feel feel the same towards you is very important . I think , however , that sometimes people become so dependent on others that they often fail to look to themselves for the strength needed to heal and to grow that is most definitely there . And when other people fail to be there for them for any reason , they find it hard to pick themselves back up . 
Anyone know threw schedule for tomorrow ? I just need to know the order of the periods . 
Can I move yet ? I need shit to start moving forward ... 
I'm going to miss my dad's cooking . :( 
I was involved in 2 accidents in one day and someone broke into my mom's car . Fun day !

Everyone is at an equal length of stupid . If we just open our eyes a little wider and realize the only difference between us is our words and how we use them , maybe we can all become a little equal length closer to each other . 
At Barnes & < PROPMALE > with < PROPMALE > . :D So Dalai Lama , what is The < PROPMALE > of Happiness ?

The Manor was awesome last night ! Thanks to all tht people who helped to make it an amazing night ! 
Just watched The Butterfly Effect . Great movie ... Why can't I handle this shit , though ? Fuck my overactive imagination ! 
Anyone ever have a problem where their scars turn black after surgery ? 
How could this have happened ? Fear led people to do much of it , but there were many more who willingly and enthusiastically participated . How can there be so much hate for your own kind ? 
I love humanity and cry for their pain . 
Got a new laptop and rollerblades ! One step closer to being ready for college ! 
So I think this two < PROPFEMALE > research paper is going to become a 6+ < PROPFEMALE > paper . o.O But how could I possibly leave all this stuff out ?!
