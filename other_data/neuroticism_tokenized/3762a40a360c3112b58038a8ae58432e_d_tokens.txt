Did karoke and a sauna today , the karoke was in a closed room , like you would see in anime , and the sauna was very nice , a bunch of different rooms with different things on the walls . Lots of fun . Hope I dont miss math tomorow . 
How disgusting . A cockroach flew into my room , and as I tried to catch it to throw it out , it flew in my fan , shredding itself into < PROPFEMALE > pieces that now remain on my floor . My house is so gross ... 
Hayate no Gotoku even references the 300 , wow !

Board . Silent Hill games fail compared to Fatal Frames . D:

The . hack// G.U. games are so good . <3 Alkaid <3 
I LOVE MY NEW TV .

Oh god , Leet Speak is really an option on Facebook languages now . 
I'm thinking I should dye my hair back to black , or maybe even another color . What do you think ? 
So I just started watching Katanagatari . It's really good so far ( Episode 3 ) , but it's so wordy . They talk a lot . Maybe more than Death Note . 
So there's a show called < PROPFEMALE>'s Greatest Otaku ... It's on Hulu ... 
Katanagatari was really good . 
Watching Skip Beat ! \ 
Pretty good . Cute show . 
I played some MvC3 at BestBuy today . Got my shit rocked by some little kid who was on the 1p side and kept picking 30 seconds as the time and spammed jabs . I could win with a basic combo on Sent , but not Tron . I really suck at that game lol . 
Skip Beat ! Ended terribly ! I really need to start reading manga >.> 
Can't wait for Momocon ! 
Woo ! First platinum trophy ! 
Ugh , so tired . Good thing I stayed up all night before a final to get to the last episode of Highschool of the Dead ! -.- b
