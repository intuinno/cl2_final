Goodbye 2010 , I'll surely miss you .. but as the experience of mistakes that I shouldnt have again on 2011 . Its time to refresh and move on 

Girls have a bad habit of holding on for too long . Guys have a bad habit of letting go too easily right ??? 
??????????? H ??????????????????? ÿ ????? N ??????????? ???????????????? 2011 ??? 
Baby , There goes somebody's miracle\ 
Walking down the street\ 
There goes some other < PROPFEMALE > tale\ 
I wish it could happen to me\ 
But I look at myself\ 
Wonderin ' if i'm just too weak\ 
To have such faith in myself 
Say love , say love\ 
Or love's gonna get you down\ 
\ 
I went walking in with my mama one day\ 
When she warned me what people say\ 
Live your life until love is found\ 
' Cause love's gonna get you down\ 
Mama told me what I should know\ 
Too much < PROPFEMALE > gonna rot your soul\ 
If she loves you , let her go\ 
' Cause love only gets you down

Is mad that everyone keeps saying im young when there only like 2years older 
Had an awesome time at youth tonight ! :) 
Is chatting with my friends ! 
Crazy Life , Crazy People ... Good and Gracious God ... :) 
It's much easier to turn a friendship into love , than love into friendship . 
There is no friendship , no love , like that of the parent for the child . 
A single < PROPFEMALE > can be my garden ... a single friend , my world 
Friendship is like money , easier made than kept . 
Friendship without self-interest is one of the rare and beautiful things of life . 
The rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them , each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other , always using friendly and sincere words . 
Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another . 
Comfort the afflicted , and afflict the comfortable . 
What we see depends mainly on what we look for . 
Awesome time of prayer in < PROPFIRST > today ... neat time of fellowship . Thank you , Jesus !!! National Day of Prayer should be EVERY day ... 
One eyed one horn fly'in purple people eater ! :) 
fallin in love , its such an easy thing to do , if birds can do we can do it , lets stop talkin lets get to it , lets fall in love :)

<3 If I die young bury me in satin\ 
Lay me down on a bed of roses\ 
Sink me in the river at dawn\ 
Send me away with the words of a love song <3 
She grew up on the side of the road\ 
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows\ 
She grew up good\ 
She grew up slow\ 
Like American < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Steady as a preacher\ 
Free as a weed\ 
Couldn't wait to get goin'\ 
But wasn't quite ready to leave\ 
So innocent , pure and sweet\ 
American < PROPFEMALE >

? Colt Ford ? \ 
She's pretty as a field of daisies\ 
She's sweeter than watermelon wine\ 
Way hotter than the alabama asphalt\ 
And when I get her in these arms of mine\ 
Lord have mercy I love her kisses\ 
Man I can't get enough\ 
Kinda like chicken and biscuits ? 
Lead me with strong hands\ 
Stand up when I can't\ 
Don't leave me hungry for love\ 
Chasing dreams , what about us ? \ 
Show me you're willing to fight\ 
That I'm still the love of your life\ 
I know we call this our home\ 
But I still feel alone 
God gave me you for the ups and downs\ 
God gave me you for the days of doubt\ 
For when I think I've lost my way\ 
There are no words here left to say , it's true\ 
God gave me you 
B-26\ 
Its a number . \ 
Its a song . \ 
Its a girl . \ 
Smooth . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > joy packed . \ 
Gold falafel , \ 
As through ice . \ 
Its four-thirty . \ 
Morning with\ 
Phone calls . \ 
Its deaf mute . \ 
Its cheap . \ 
A foreign car . \ 
Maybe bingo . \ 
Lucky night ? \ 
Something says\ 
It smells bad . 
Every blessing you pour out , \ 
I turn back to praise\ 
When the darkness closes in , \ 
Lord\ 
Still I will say ... \ 
Blessed be the name of the Lord\ 
Blessed be Your name\ 
Blessed be Your glorious name 
Surrounded by Your < PROPFEMALE > , \ 
What will my heart feel \ 
Will I dance for You Jesus \ 
Or in awe of You be still \ 
Will I stand in Your presence \ 
Or to my knees will I fall \ 
Will I sing hallelujah , will I be able to speak at all \ 
I can only imagine 
Here I am to worship , \ 
Here I am to bow down , \ 
Here I am to say that You're my God\ 
You're altogether lovely\ 
All together worthy , \ 
All together wonderful to me 
It is God's will that you should be sanctified : that you should avoid sexual immorality ; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable . - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 -4 
Therefore , I urge you , brothers , in view of God's mercy , to offer your bodies as living sacrifices , holy and pleasing to Godthis is your spiritual act of worship . - Romans 12:1 
For attractive lips , speak words of kindness . \ 
For lovely eyes , seek out the good in people . \ 
For a slim figure , share your food with the hungry . \ 
For beautiful hair , let a child run his fingers through it once a day . \ 
For poise , walk with the knowledge you'll never walk alone 
But the Voice of truth tells me a different story\ 
the Voice of truth says \do not be afraid ! \ " \ 
Cities full of hatred , fear and lies\ 
Withered hearts and cruel , tormented eyes\ 
Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise\ 
Beating down the multitude and\ 
Scoffing at the wise\ 
Can't we raise our eyes and make a start ? \ 
Can't we find the minds to lead us\ 
Closer to the heart ?

Can everyone please pray for my mom ? She got bit by a cat yesterday REALLY badly and it didn't belong to anyone so it wasn't vaccinated . It's being quaranteened right now to make sure it doesn't have rabies . They don't think it does ... they said they think it was just grouchy , but we're kind of scared . She has to get a tetanus shot tomorrow and had I.V. antibiotics through the night . It's painful . 
Can everybody keep praying for my mom . Her bite is infected and it looks really bad and she might have to go to the hospital which she really doesn't want to do . She's having a hard time with her medication they gave her , it is making her really sick . And they can't give her the tetanus shot because she is allergic to something in it . We are both scared . 
Is grading papers .. 
Hi Everyone ... My mom is doing a little better . Her fever is mostly going down and most of the redness around is gone but the actual bite area is still bad . The creature seems healthy so far but still has a week of quarantine . The other thing is that my mom can't have a tetanus shot and the hospital said that can take months to know . PLEASE pray she doesn't get it . PLEASE . PLEASE . I love you all , < PROPFEMALE > 
I am freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg to death !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
\Come on ! 13 is halfway to 26 and 26 is half way to 52 and 52 is half way to death ! Please let me get a job before I die \"" 
It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cold ! And ... it's only the beginning ... we haven't even made it to winter , yet ! Brrrrr ! 
Hi everyone , I just wanted to tell you all the the animal that bit my mom is NOT rabid . Yay . So , we don't have to worry about that but she is really stressed about tetanus ( sp ? ) because she cannot have the shot . Please keep praying . That can take months to know but usually within like a month . Please pray . And Thank you all so much . 
My mom glued her hands together .. On purpose .. 
So when I was babysitting last night I asked on of the little girls if she was allergic to anything .. She said she was allergic to bread and had to \go get yummy yummy bread from the yummy bread store\ " and then she said she was \ " very allergic to the green bay packers\ " :) on the contrary she broke out in prayer saying \ " God bless the green bay packers please help them\ " lol :) "

To be outside the crowdYou don't know what it's like\ 
To be left outAnd you don't know how it feels\

You might see more of me than meets the eye\ 
And you've been all wrong \ 
Not who you think I am\ 
You've never given me a < PROPMALE >

< PROPFEMALE > : Okay , why is Prue not answering < PROPFEMALE>'s question ? 
Piper : You know , if I could freeze the two of you , I would , often . 
Darryl : Piper ... \ 
Piper : Uh-huh . \ 
Darryl : You froze the crime scene . \ 
Darryl : You cannot freeze a crime scene . \ 
Piper : Well , I did . 
Phoebe : Hey ! Don't call me sweetie ! You can't imprison someone and then call them sweetie ! 
Leo : Look , < PROPFEMALE > , no matter what happens ... \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : No ... \ 
Leo : You have to keep trying to make contact . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : I don't want him to hear it ... \ 
Leo : He's not after you , he's after me . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Would you please stop trying to save me ! \ 
Leo : I'm sorry I got you into this . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : [ crying ] Yeah , just one ordeal after another , right ? \ 
Leo : I've never stopped loving you . 
Paige : Power . Power's good . I like power . Why do I like power ? 
Cole : < PROPFEMALE > , I love you . I don't know what's going on but maybe I can help . Would you like me to kill someone for you ? 
Barbas : How cute . The great big elder's afraid of the teeny-weeny itsy-witsy baby 
Phoebe : No time to dawdle , there's a baby on the way . \ 
Leo : This is crazy . You can't leave like this . \ 
Paige : We , very well can't ignore < PROPFIRST>'s birth now can we ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : I'm the baby . I give you permission to . 
[ < PROPMALE > has shrunken < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > into a doll house size of the Manor ] < PROPFEMALE > : OK ... let me handle < PROPMALE > . This requires a mother's touch ... < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Halliwell ! You stop this nonsense right now ! 
Piper : < PROPFEMALE > , how many times have I told you not to play dress-up with the demons ? 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , you cant be the < PROPFEMALE > of the Underworld and a charmed one ! 
Piper : I dreamt an animated musical last night . Is that normal ? 
Phoebe : 28 minutes , 33 seconds . [ Piper looks at her ] \ 
Piper : Really ? We ran that long ? \ 
Phoebe : No , that's how long you've been comparing < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . \ 
Piper : I haven't been comparing - I've just been ... talking . \ 
Phoebe : Non-stop . 
Phoebe : Piper . \ 
Piper : Don't you \Piper\ " me . " 
< PROPFEMALE > : Oh , you know what ? She's getting angry . And our powers don't work so good when we're angry . \ 
Mitzy Stillman : We've got them now . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Yeah , you've got us now so why don't you blow us up ? \ 
Phoebe : < PROPFEMALE > , death bad , life good . \ 
Paige : Don't worry , this bimbo couldn't hit the broadside of a beauty parlour . Check out that dye job . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Stillman : How dare you ! [ < PROPFEMALE > blows up the doors ] \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Run ! 
Phoebe : [ singing ] Oh , I'm making soup for < PROPMALE > , he'll eat it in a bowl , I guess that's my new role , making soup for < PROPMALE > . 
Darryl : Okay , where is this baby that everybody keeps talking about ? Is it an invisible baby ? Am I gonna step on it ? 
Cole : You've got to hold my hand . \ 
Prue : This already sucks . 
Piper : It was all of those women showing off their sonogram pictures , and it was just working on my last nerve . Like , \Look 
Leo : I hate to be a bearer of bad news . \ 
Piper : Could you possibly be the bearer of a big hug ? 
Grams : < PROPFEMALE > blew up the wolf from inside . Although it took her long enough . < PROPFEMALE > : Hey , back off Grams , I just saved your butt . 
Piper : Vanquish demon first , kill husband later . 
Piper : So let me get this straight . You summoned me to a cage where our powers don't work so , what , we could all die together ? \ 
Paige : I'll admit the plan has a few flaws . 
[ Piper's morning sickness is causing her to burp small orbs of white light ] \ 
Paige : [ to < PROPFIRST > ] Okay , is that normal ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : All this arguing is probably just upsetting the baby . \ 
Piper : [ indicating size with her hands ] < PROPFIRST > , the baby is an inch long . All this arguing is upsetting the mommy . 
Cole : You're pregnant ? \ 
Piper : I was , but now I think < PROPFIRST > is . 
Cole : [ the Charmed ones are being inspired by a muse ] I think < PROPFIRST > should orb me down to the Underworld . I may not be a demon anymore , but I still know the terrain . \ 
Phoebe : And you may just find yourself in ever-lasting pain ! \ 
Paige : ... That was a rhyme . \ 
Phoebe : I know ; and now is not the time . 
Craig : Who are you ? \ 
Paige : Witch . \ 
Leo : Angel . \ 
Phoebe : Mermaid . 
Grams : Have you been exercising your powers daily ? \ 
Piper : Do I need to ? \ 
Grams : Well , you know , if you don't want to lose control of them . Did you perform a ritual to promote growth ? \ 
[ Piper and < PROPFIRST > look sheepish ] \ 
Grams : Did you cast a spell to < PROPMALE > off demonic parasites ? \ 
Grams : Sweetheart , what did you do ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : We built a nursery in our bedroom closet . \ 
Grams : No wonder this baby summoned me . 
[ Piper and < PROPFIRST > stand over < PROPMALE>'s crib looking down at him ] \ 
Piper : He's so ... innocent . If only he had any idea what Mommy and Auntie < PROPFEMALE > did today . \ 
< PROPFIRST > : [ to < PROPMALE > ] They turned a very bad man to a very big tree . 
Paige : [ about Leo ] She's blown him up ... literally ? \ 
Phoebe : Yeah , but you know < PROPFEMALE > , she didn't mean anything by it . 
< PROPFIRST > Wyatt : What is that ? Is that a time portal ? Is that what that is ? What are you using it for ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > Perry : I don't have to answer that . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Wyatt : I thought you said you had nothing to hide . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Perry : I don't have to answer that either . 
Drake Robin : The point is , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s love , it's epic , it's massive . It's < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Paige : All tragedies , I might add . 
[ To Wyatt ] \ 
Leo : Give daddy back his powers now . 
Paige : What just happened ? \ 
Piper : The freaking furniture just attacked us . 
Paige : Hey ! What are you doing here ? \ 
Henry : What am I doing here ? I'm looking for my wife . She didn't come home last night . Are you okay ? \ 
Paige : Yes , I'm okay . Of course I'm okay . I mean , we weren't okay okay . But now we're okay . And I think in the future we're gonna be ... I think we're going to be more than okay ! \ 
Henry : Okay ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Halliwell : Did we miss anything ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Halliwell : No , well , we changed the past and fixed the future and saved the present . That's all . 
Leo : Something's wrong ! Something's wrong , I can't orb ! I was trying to go to the Elders to find out how to get rid of the < PROPFEMALE > geese and why is there a unicorn in the kitchen ? 
Leo : How was your date ? \ 
Piper : Short . \ 
Leo : Like leprechaun short ? 
Piper : It is bad luck to see the bride's dress before the wedding . \ 
Leo : But you're not even wearing your dress . \ 
Piper : The same rule applies to the bride's curlers . Go away . 
< PROPFIRST > ( about Piper ): I work , she says I'm never around . I quit my job , she says I'm around too much . 
Leo : Why am I standing in the ocean ? \ 
Piper : < PROPFEMALE>'s a mermaid . \ 
Leo : Oh , well , that would explain it . 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , what are you doing ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Getting irritated . Who put Lady Attitude in charge ? \ 
Leo : She's not in charge . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Really ? ' Cause she's acting like it . I thought Whitelighters were supposed to guide , not dictate . 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , he's gonna kill me when he finds out . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Don't be ridiculous , you're already dead . 
< PROPFEMALE > ( talking about the new whitelighter ): Well as soon as he gets here I'll blow him up ! \ 
Leo : You can't blow him up < PROPFEMALE > .. \ 
Phoebe : Why not ? She blows you up all the time . 
Leo : Being with her broke the rules , not being with her breaks my heart . 
< PROPFIRST > : Wow , looks great . When do we eat ? \ 
Piper : < PROPFIRST > , can't you see we're having a sister moment ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : Oh , sorry . Do you want me to go ? 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , you cant be the < PROPFEMALE > of the Underworld and a Charmed One ! 
Phoebe : We thought that the good guys were bad guys , in trying to vanquish them we helped the real bad guys , which were dead ringers for the good guys \ 
Leo : Was that English ? 
Leo : Thanks for not listening to me . \ 
Chris : Any time . 
< PROPFIRST > : Uh , shouldn't we concentrate on swapping our powers back ? \ 
Paige : Now , < PROPFIRST > , you know how that works . You two are only going to get your powers back once you've learned your lessons . \ 
Piper : Ugh . I hate that . It's just so very after-school special . 
Piper : Prue , no ! No-no-no-no , very bad , Prue . Very , very bad Prue . ( Prue growls . ) Hi , Kujo , who you growling at ? \ 
Leo : Maybe Id better go check with the elders and see if they know how to vanquish a Banshee . \ 
Phoebe : Wait a minute , dont tell me youre afraid of Prue . \ 
Leo : Yeah . 
Piper : Well , speaking of Whitelighters , I dreamt an animated musical last night . Is that normal ? \ 
Leo : Normal ? \ 
Piper : Yeah , in case you haven't noticed which I know you haven't , my body , my thoughts , my dreams have all gone wonky . 
< PROPFIRST > : Oh , not the crying thing . \ 
Piper : < PROPFIRST > , I have growing powers inside of me . Powers that I do not understand , and the only person who does understand them never has time to talk . Add that to raging hormones and I guarantee you I am absolutely entitled to do the crying thing ! 
Leo : Dang it , < PROPFEMALE > . I would appreciate it if you didn't practice on me . I may be dead but it still hurts ! 
Piper : PLEASE , don't tell me you've been vanquishing demons with the children . \ 
Leo : Well , < PROPFIRST > was fussy . It calmed him . 
[ Leo is standing on the tower of the < PROPFEMALE > Gate bridge , < PROPFIRST > orbs in]\ 
< PROPFIRST > : What are you doing here ? \ 
Leo : Communing with the others . \ 
< PROPFIRST > : Can any one see us ? \ 
Leo : Not me , but you look like a lunatic talking to yourself up here . 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > needs to talk to you in the dressing room . \ 
Cole : It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding . \ 
Leo : ( referring to < PROPFEMALE>'s invisibility ) I don't think that's going to be a problem . 
Piper : I'm trying to protect our son ! \ 
Leo : From who ? His Mommy & Me teacher !? 
< PROPFIRST > ( in < PROPFEMALE>'s body ): You know it's one thing to have my wife constantly criticize everything I do , it's another thing when you do it from my own body !! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > ( in < PROPFIRST>'s body ): Well , since I figured you never listen to me you might listen to yourself ! 
< PROPFIRST > : This is really bad . \ 
Phoebe : < PROPFIRST > , relax . < PROPFEMALE>'s been dead before . 
Leo : There's nobody here . Nobody except the most beautiful woman in the world . Piper : ( laughs ) Have you been on top of the Bridge again lately ? Cause I'm telling you , there's not enough oxygen up there . 
Leo : Where's < PROPFEMALE > going ? \ 
Paige : Probably to a mental institution . 
Leo : I'll go get her . \ 
Piper : No ! I do not want < PROPMALE > to have two headless parents . Send < PROPFIRST > ! 
Leo : Now listen , when you get back there , you gotta take it easy on < PROPMALE > , okay ? You can't hold a grudge . \ 
Chris : Hey , as long as he's not ruler of all evil , I'm cool ! 
Leo : We have leprechauns in the living room . \ 
Piper : Be glad they're not trolls . 
Piper : < PROPFEMALE > , could you orb upstairs and get that ? \ 
Leo : I wouldn't have to if you hadn't blown up the phone in the kitchen this morning . \ 
Piper : It was a rough morning ! 
Piper : Remember when I told you you just had to trust me ? This is the only way . \ 
Leo : The only way ? Piper .. \ 
Piper : I have to lose you to save you . It's just our screwed up < PROPFEMALE > and you kind of got caught in the middle . I'm so sorry . \ 
Leo:It's all right . We've .. been through worse . \ 
Piper : No , we haven't . \ 
Leo:We're gonna get through this . \ 
Piper : Of course we will . 
Phoebe : < PROPFEMALE > is ... dead ? \ 
Leo : Don't worry , the dwarves are all over it . 
Leo : What's going on ? \ 
[ Piper throws up her hand and covers her eyes . < PROPFEMALE > puts a hand over her mouth . < PROPFEMALE > puts her hands over her ears]\ 
Leo : I see . \ 
[ Piper throws down her hands in frustration]\ 
Piper : Well , I don't! Where is < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Piper , \ 
When we first met you thought I was just a handyman . Well I'm just a handyman again . The same guy you fell in love with . The same guy who fell in love with you , for who you are not who I think you are . Remember that , and know that I will never give up . \ 
< PROPFIRST > 
Reamus : I am an Elder and I can forsee the future , enough of it anyway to give you a glimpse . If you're interested . \ 
Leo : Isn't that against the rules ? \ 
Reamus : I'm retiring , what do I care ? 
Leo : Since when are prenatal yoga and home-birthing videos your idea of a good time ? \ 
Paige : Since I became a friendless loser with no life . 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > ? < PROPFEMALE > , we have to go . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : I don't want to go . \ 
Leo : Why not ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Because if I go , that'll mean that Prue's really not coming back , and I don't think I can handle that . \ 
Leo : We can handle it together . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : She's been there my whole life . I've always had a big sister . And I don't know how to live without one . 
< PROPFEMALE > : Are you sure ? \ 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , I've been a Whitelighter for over 50 years ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Ok-ay ! 
Piper : Honey .. \ 
Leo : Yeah ? \ 
Piper : Zip it ! \ 
Leo : Okay . 
Leo : Can we refrain from blowing up demons in the nursery ? \ 
Piper : Oh , it was just one . 
Elf Nanny : Welcome , wise one . \ 
Piper : Oh , no , this is just my husband . He's not an Elder . He's just wearing this robe because .. why are you wearing this robe ? \ 
Leo : It was < PROPFEMALE > up there . 
Paige : Are Elders Even Allowed To Swear ? \ 
Leo : No , But Fathers Are , Especially When Their Sons Try To Kill Them\ 
Phoebe : Well , Technically You Can't Die\ 
Leo : That's Not The Point 
Phoebe : I thought she was an innocent . How was I supposed to know that I was gonna unleash a demon . \ 
Leo : It says so right here . \ 
Phoebe : Oh , right - right there ... in Arabic ! 
Piper : Ah , what happened ?! \ 
Leo : You guys almost died , that's what happened . \ 
Piper : Yeah , well , what else is new ? 
Leo : Look , I know you're upset . \ 
Piper : No , I skated past upset right after you came in the door . Right now I'm at furious . \ 
Leo : We have to talk . \ 
Piper : You bet your whitelighter butt we do ! 
Leo : That's my boy using your powers . \ 
Piper : You trying to give Mommy a heart attack ? 
Patty : It happened when < PROPFIRST > and I were together . \ 
Cole : < PROPFIRST > ? \ 
Leo : Their Mom's whitelighter . \ 
Cole : The apple doesn't fall far from the forbidden tree , I see . 
Piper : The only Halliwell that likes earthquakes . \ 
Prue : I don't like them , but I don't go running naked through the house screaming , \RUN FOR YOUR LIFE . \ " either . \ 
Cole : Can't you at least let me not die in peace ? 
[ Letter from < PROPMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > ]\ 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , \ 
If I'm dead right now , I know it was at your hand . No one else in heaven or hell had Power over me . Please , don't cry . I was dead Before I met you . I was Born the day you loved me . ( C . ) 
Cole : She has no regard for her life , or anyone else's . She's < PROPFIRST > Bronson cubed . \ 
Leo : I said I'd talk to her . \ 
Phoebe : Guys , guys . Who is < PROPFIRST > Bronson ? Never mind . 
Leo : Can you babysit the boys tonight ? \ 
Paige : That's all I do . I babysit teachers , I babysit students , I babysit everybody ! 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , are you mad at me ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : No , don't be ridiculous . Why would I be mad at you ? \ 
Leo : I don't know , that's why I'm asking . What is it ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : It's just , um , < PROPFIRST > . \ 
Leo : Oh . Never mind , sorry I asked . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Um , he's-he's going to be ... He's going to be very upset when he finds out ... you're the one that I really love . \ 
Leo : Yeah ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Yeah . 
Piper : What happened ? \ 
Leo : What always happens when you have one of your episodes , you threw yourself against the wall 
Piper : Are you siding with < PROPFEMALE > now ? \ 
Leo : Hey , there's no sides . And , yes . 
< PROPFEMALE > : And < PROPFEMALE > , thank you so much for getting him this job . I mean especially now that we're going to be married and he's gonna have to get used to bringing home the bacon . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Since when does < PROPFEMALE > care about bacon ? \ 
Leo : I'm sure she meant all breakfast meats . 
Piper : Baby Book . My baby book . Oh , look how squishy I was ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > : Hmm , you were so adorable . \ 
Piper : < PROPFIRST > , you can't even see the picture . \ 
< PROPFIRST > : I'm your whitelighter , I've been watching you ever since you were a baby . \ 
Piper : Uh huh . Yeah , see that's too creepy to think about . 
Piper : He works with < PROPFIRST > all day . You know how < PROPFEMALE > is with math . They have absolutely nothing in common . \ 
Leo : You're right . We- we should just vanquish him . 
Piper : I can't handle this right now . \ 
Leo : What ? I told you I was going to have to break a few rules . \ 
Piper : No , no , no . You don't understand , this is the least of our problems . Which ought to give you and idea how bad our problems actually are ! \ 
Leo : Come on , it can't be that bad . \ 
Piper : Unless I am mistaken , < PROPMALE > has teamed up with Jerich and tricked me into getting < PROPFEMALE > possessed and < PROPFEMALE > mummified . 
Leo : Come on < PROPFEMALE > , isn't this supposed to be a fun thing . You know , going back and seeing all your old friends . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : You weren't by any < PROPMALE > popular in high school were you ? \ 
Leo : Well I was .. I mean .. Is there a right answer to this question ? 
Piper : I still don't understand why my sisters can't come , we could just do a group hug thing , and .. \ 
Leo : I can orb you because you're my wife , but I'm not a cosmic taxi for the whole family . \ 
Phoebe : Hehe ... you said wife ! 
Leo : < PROPFEMALE > , this is completely illegal . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Yeah ? Well , so is marrying a dead guy , okay ? 
Piper : < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Halliwell , you will stop this nonsense right now ! \ 
Leo : Wow , first time you use his full name . \ 
Piper : Yeah , well , it sounds better when I'm scolding him .

Now the lesson's learned\ 
I touched it I was burned\ 
Oh I think you should know 
She's got her head up in the clouds\ 
Sharada , Sharada\ 
Don't know when she'll come down\ 
She can't get to bed\ 
She's got this song stuck in her head 
I'm always workin ' slavin ' every day\ 
Gotta get a break from the same old same old\ 
I need a < PROPMALE > just to get away\ 
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say\ 
Don't need nothin ' but a good time\ 
How can I resist\ 
Ain't lookin ' for nothin ' but a good time\ 
And it don't get better than this 
It's the eye of the tiger , it's \ 
the thrill of the fight \ 
Rising up to the challenge of our rival\ 
And the last known survivor \ 
stalks his prey in the night \ 
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger 
I want to break free\ 
I want to break free from your lies\ 
You're so self-satisfied I don't need you\ 
I got to to break free 
And I'll stand there with the Wizard , \ 
Feeling things I've never felt . \ 
And though I'd never show it , \ 
I'll be so happy , I could melt ! \ 
And so it will be\ 
For the rest of my life , \ 
And I'll want nothing else\ 
Till I die . \ 
Held in such high esteem . \ 
When people see me , they will scream\ 
For half of Oz's favorite team ;\ 
The Wizard\ 
And I 
I'm through accepting limits\ 
Cuz someone says they're so\ 
Some things I cannot change\ 
But till I try I'll never know\ 
Too long I've been afraid of\ 
Losing love , I guess I've lost\ 
Well if that's love\ 
It comes at much too high a cost\ 
I'd sooner buy defying gravity\ 
Kiss me goodbye , I'm defying gravity\ 
And you can't pull me down ! 
So if you care to find me\ 
Look to the Western sky ! \ 
As someone told me lately\ 
Everyone deserves the < PROPMALE > to fly\ 
And if I'm flying solo\ 
At least I'm flying free\ 
To those who ground me\ 
Take a message back from me ! \ 
Tell them how I am defying gravity\ 
I'm flying high , defying gravity\ 
And soon I'll match them in renown\ 
And nobody in all of Oz\ 
No Wizard that there is or was\ 
Is ever gonna bring me down !! 
Let Freedom ring , let the white dove sing\ 
Let the whole world know that today is a \ 
Day of reckoning\ 
Let the weak be strong , let the right be wrong\ 
Roll the stone away , let the guilty pay , it's \ 
Independence Day 
Baby you can be tough\ 
Say enough is enough\ 
You can even be blunt\ 
Just do it with love love love love\ 
Tell me I'm wrong\ 
That I'm coming on way too strong\ 
Don't think I'll be crushed\ 
Just do it with love 
I tried to tell myself he got a good impression\ 
I tried to make myself ask him one simple question\ 
But I did not know how he felt , it wasn't easy\ 
So I let him slip , I let him slip away\ 
But did he know\ 
Did he know , oh\ 
Did he know that he was the only one I noticed\ 
Did < PROPFIRST > know I wanted him bad\ 
I just couldn't show the feelings I had\ 
Did < PROPFIRST > see in me what I saw in him\ 
' Cause it was everything\ 
It was everything 
Im caught up in you , \ 
Im facing the truth , \ 
What else can I do , \ 
With all these emotions \ 
Cause Im , Im falling deeper in every way \ 
I cant sleep at night \ 
Cause nothing feels right , \ 
I cant deny \ 
My heart when your near me , \ 
My love \ 
Grows stronger everyday \ 
Oo , oo , yeah \ 
Caught up in you , 
You look like an angel\ 
Walk like an angel\ 
Talk like an angel\ 
But I got wise\ 
You're the devil in disguise\ 
Oh yes you are\ 
The devil in disguise\ 
You fooled me with your kisses\ 
You cheated and you schemed\ 
Heaven knows how you lied to me\ 
You're not the way you seemed

I'm starting to like you less , because I'm starting to love you more . 
Looking for ' true love ' is like buying a book on how to read . 
To love for the sake of being loved is human , but to love for the sake of loving is angelic . \
