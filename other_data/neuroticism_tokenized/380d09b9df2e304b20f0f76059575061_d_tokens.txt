2009 : My most eventful year yet !!! 2010 : ??? ;) 

Water balloons hate me . 
Frisbees , water balloons , and mosquitoes hate me . I love summer ! 
loves corn bread muffins and apricots , except that all mine fell on the floor . I love summer ! 
saw The Hangover . Drunk people do some pretty disgusting things . And men are idiots . 
Chocolate is a crucial part of a woman's diet . Please give me some ! 
CHOCOLATE in my house is like gasoline . It costs too much , and it disappears too quickly !! 
Does it mean you're a cold person if you are able to make a candle go out just by looking at it ? 
... is lonely . Everybody in the whole world has seriously left me here , alone . Come back , everybody ! for this house feels far too quiet .... 
Exactly ! 
I believe that I am just now waking up from my own little Nightmare . 
I believe there is only one person in this world who I've stayed up texting till literally 4 in the morning ...... :) 
:) :) :) :) :) :P :P :P :P :P ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) :D :D :D :D :D <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 .......! 
:) :) :) :) :P :P :P :P ;) ;) ;) ;) :D :D :D :D ? ? ? ? ............! 
:) ;) :P :D <3 ! 
Please don't FML . I happen to like ML ! 
is leaving for Milwaukee , and then on Tuesday flying to New York !! Going to Gettysburg and other various places in Pennsylvania , etc .. I am hoping this trip is fun but goes quickly at the same time ......... 
is back home in Wisconsin .... Home of THE BEST gol darn COW FARMERS you will EVER FIND !!!!!!!!!!!! :) 
can't wait for < PROPFEMALE > to come over in half an hour ! I hope it doesn't rain ... 
just had an extremely fun , random , weird , stupid , crazy day with < PROPFEMALE > ! Went running , almost got eaten by a rabid Rottweiler , made it home alive , made ( and ate ) PB & J sandwiches , drained my freshly charged camera battery , played on the swings , dressed up 
Chocolate Ice Cream + Caramel And Chocolate Syrup + Broken Shards of Buttery Pretzels + Jumbo-sized Marshmallows + Sprinkles + Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal + Salted Peanuts + a Bowl = A REALLY GOOD-TASTING SUNDAE !! And a stomachache :( 
Stupid , stupid college stuff ... can't put this off any longer ... how am I supposed to know what I want to spend my life doing ???? Can't they all just wait till I'm ready to grow up and then have me decide ? Would that really be so hard ??? 
I gotta feelin ' .... 
Fun night planned . Babysitting 9 to 10 kids from 5 to 10 . Sleeping over at < PROPFEMALE>'s from 10 to whenever .....? :) :) :) SIMS ALL NIGHT ... can't wait . 
just returned from < PROPFEMALE>'s . Babysitting 9 kids was easier than expected :) 
had a perfectly wonderful day . ;) 
is just feeling ... so ... whatever . 
Tonight better be fun . . . Or else . 
got a Super Sunburn at the tennis courts with < PROPFEMALE > , then went to Frosty Mug , then work . Fun day . 
wonders about people . People who are always busy . People who are leaving to faraway places for college . People who make plans and then don't answer their phones . I guess you can't rely on anybody to stick around for very long these days , can you ? :( 
is going to bed because ... It's just a little too late , a little too wrong , and I can't wait . Boy you know all the right things to sayyyy .... Ya know , it's just a little too late . Lol :) ... Just listened to < PROPFEMALE > sing this nice song to me on the phone . 
When you hear this song and sing along and never tell , well you're a fool , it's just as well , hope it gives you h*& ! :) 
I <3 The Beach . I do not <3 work and it making me have to leave The Beach . 
Sometimes you feel miserable and want to feel better . Sometimes you feel miserable and decide it's easier and far more convenient to just go on feeling that way . 
Went out for lunch with < PROPFEMALE > . Don't think I'm going to eat again for the next three weeks ! : I Workin ' at six . Beach picnic tomorrow mornin ! Okay so maybe I will be eating sooner than I thought .... :) 
Who would steal pajama shorts ? Or am I supposed to assume they walked off by themselves ? 
<3 <3 <3 B*E*A*C*H* ! <3 <3 <3 
< PROPFEMALE > makes me laugh so hard it hurts . :) Lol ! Ouch ! 
JuSt KeEp LauGhiNg and NO ONE will HuRt YoU ;) Best quote ever ! 
feels free . :) 
:( 
Today I washed Jessafer < PROPMALE > . Yay , he's shiny and green again ! So thankful for Febreze . Love that stuff ! 
had a very fun day earlier with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . Can't wait for tomorrow at < PROPFEMALE>'s! Volleyball in the rain ! And Friday with < PROPFEMALE > ! Canoeing ! And the weekend ! Working ! Lol .

j e n n y j e s s e n i s m y b e s t f r i e n d : ) 
\Me + you ... I'ma tell you ' One time ... ' \"" 
is making an attempt to quickly finish reading/skimming the Twilight series before school starts , so that Krueger does not have a fit when I walk into his room and he finds out that it's been a whole year and I STILL have not read Eclipse OR Breaking < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I wAs hanGiNg in the cORnER wiTh My FIVE BEsT fRiEnDs ... I heArD that yOu were trOubLE but I cOuLDn't reSiSt !! :o 
CAMPFIRE , yay ! Fun !! Woo hooooooo !!! 
OUCH ... it's the weirdest thing ... why does this still hurt ? :o 
is looking forward to and feels immensely excited for what is likely to be another unbelievably amazing , incredibly fun-filled school year ... :/ ha . 
So , I guess , a happy life is nothing more than a string of many good days :) 
No one ever tells you that forever feels like home , when you're sitting all alone inside your head . 
makes them good girls go bad . JK 
is going to school tomorrow . :o 
is getting the backpack ready for tomorrow , and then going to bed early . No more Facebook till 1 AM ...... It's a school night ! 
is going to break this trend and NOT write a status about school ..... Well , I guess I just did , didn't I ? Never mind then ... UGH MY CLASSES ARE BORING . 
Todos mis sentidos y mi forma de pensar están contiiiigo , y < PROPFEMALE > me puede parar ... Cleaning out the Spanish folder ... can't wait for more of lovely wonderful Spanish cuatro adventures a mañana . :/ 
<3 s the PACER TEST ! YAYA ! Cheers for running faster and faster and being stared at by peers as you nearly collapse on the floor magenta-faced after lap thirty-one . 
Since when does MY little brother insist on wearing only clothing from Hollister ??? Did he acquire an eagle fetish or something ?? He's suddenly obsessed ! 
Wow , I've been awake for 19 1/2 hours straight . My day started at 5 AM , and is now ending at almost 1 AM . Just worked more hours than EVER setting up for a wedding of 285 , and went dogsitting , and drank an excess of caffeine from the bar Mountain Dew . At Drugan's . Now I'm so tired crashing from caffeine , and sugar , that I can't even type logical sentences ! Sleepytime ! 
Overly tired people should NOT be allowed to write statuses ... I just read mine from last night . I do NOT remember posting that ! ( And I was only tired , I swear . ) 
loves how EVERYONE is making a Stalker Note after I started the trend .... at least I think I did , since I first got it from somebody who not many Holmenites have as a friend :) 
My mom thinks I'm fat , so she stopped buying ice cream . fml ! :( 
Coffee and homework . Okay , I AM going to do this . No more foolin ' around ! P.S. Happy Labor Day 
Oh yeah ? Well < PROPFEMALE > Jessen is a HOMOCIDAL FAIRY-SUCKING CLAM-LICKING SHOPLIFTING STALKER \cat\ " DELINQUENT HOMEOPATHIC ASYLUM RUNAWAY CREEPER and also a FLAMIN ' WEIRDO FREAK !!!!!!! jkjkjkjk I <3 you too " 
is having a \senior moment\ " ... ha . ha . " 
Tanning .... homework ... tanning .... homework ..... which one would I rather do ? Okay , I've got it ... tanning AND homework at the SAME time . Yes . Not that I'll get any tanner ... but it's nice to say I tried . 
is home alone at Kait's house ... what should I do now ? I already finished off the < PROPFIRST > frozen yogurt ... :P 
just feels like crying right now for so many reasons . 
So I came home from work to my dad screaming at the TV . Something about \GO ! \ " and \ " Packers ! \ " What else is new .... I sure do love football season . " 
did absolutely nothing since school got out at 2:45 , except nap and eat corn on the cob ... Pathetic . Hopefully tomorrow will be more productive , because today was a little bit shameful . :/ 
Tu sello de amor lo llevo en la piel , ser solo amigos no es fácil , babe . 
Ain't about how fast I get there , ain't about what's waitin ' on the other SI-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-AAAHHHH-I-D-D-D-EEEE ! ( It's the climb . ) 
likes this . 
What ????? Are you freaking kidding ???!!!!!!!!!! Is this a messed up joke or something ???? :'(((((( 
READ HER LAST STATUS ................................ unbelievably ironic and weird and deep .......... read it . 
and < PROPFEMALE > are no longer in school . It isn't a happy place today . 
I have just completed the most surreal & unpredictable day of my life , probably . School , the bank , Festival , Viking , a field , a raspberry patch , Halfway Creek Park , Frosty Mug , Chemistry Lab , Mrs. Schank's cushy chair ...... I wish we could all wake up from this thing , only to realize that we all shared the same dream and it is , in fact , a bright and < PROPFEMALE > Thursday morning . 
is off to the ghost town once again . 
I love us Sen10rs . I believe we are all awesomely amazing people . <3 
seriously wishes that the amazing , wonderful , heavenly scent of Hollister clothes would last forever ... or at least longer than just one trip through the washing machine . 
is thinking about her now , it is really sorta starting to sink in for real , and I am not exactly looking forward to these next few days ... Where did she go ?? The halls are so much emptier when one person is missing from them ... : [ 
wants college now and a whole new life .... this one's gettin ' difficult to understand , impossible to deal with all at once , and outta control ! Looks like HW will just have to wait ' til it's convenient for ME .... which might not be any time soon :/ 
So here I am , putting on the only pieces of black clothing that I own , for the first funeral of my life . And for the first time in three weeks , it's raining . How about we try to make this a good day ? 
<3 s < PROPFEMALE > Jessen's profile picture :] 
somehow managed to LITERALLY sleep through gym class today ! How do you fall asleep in gym class ? Well , first you color with markers , then you watch a movie , and then you take a nap ( on a bench , in the weight room . ) It's possible ! 
can't wait for < PROPFEMALE>'s party tonight !!!!!! :P Hope it doesn't rain ..... oh wait , it already is ... I sure hope it will stop before then .... 
HW HW HW HW HW HW HW HW HW HW <---- my plans for tomorrow . Anyone want to write three essays for me ? ' Cause I'm pretty sure that over the summer , I forgot how . 
I wish I could take a nap , wake up in Italy , swim in the Mediterranean , climb an < PROPFEMALE > tree , meet some < PROPMALE > , ride into the sunset on a white horse , go to a sparkling white and blue mansion with a luxurious pool , eat REAL Italian food , and fall asleep in a meadow full of blue , pink , and red wildflowers to the song \Fireflies . \ " But I can't do that . So I'm just going to eat my dried pinapple and do HW instead . <3 " 
is so completely in love and obsessed with this song that not only is it stuck in my head , but it is THEE reason why I have not yet done ANY homework tonight :) / :( 
remembers when , once upon a time , people actually cared . :( 
wishes it were possible to skip ahead to the part where I'm in college having fun , and my roommate < PROPFEMALE > Jessen and I gather up all our baking supplies and sneak down to the UW-L basement at 3 AM to bake cookies . Then we'd meet our future husbands down in the kitchen cause What d'ya know ? They were just going to do the exact same thing ! The End :) 
feels miserable :( Seriously , I'm tired of being sick ... and I'm sick of being tired . 
\It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep .... ' cause everything is never as it seems ... when I fall asleep . \ " Goodnight ;) " 
H . O . M . E . C . O . M . I . N . G .... last one , woo ! 
had lots of fun with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > today !! Now : Drinking tea to try to help out this sore throat of mine , and attempting to upload pictures on this super , ultra , mega , extremely unbelievably slow computer ! 
Some of the best stuff is free stuff . Especially free food . Like this Oreo muffin . :) 
feels very sick , has a fever , and has no voice ..... If anybody can work for me at 5:00 , let me know . I don't have all of your cell < PROPFIRST > . ( Please ? ) 
My voice is back , YAYA ! Now instead of a 50-year-old smoker , I only sound like a 12-year-old boy whose voice is just beginning to mature . It's an improvement . :] 
99 ~ cent any ~ size sugar ~ free cappucinos !!! YAY !!! 
is trying so , so , SO hard to concentrate on hw . But listening to all the Chipmunks versions of Lil < PROPMALE > songs on YouTube is just too much fun !! 
Mandatory busser meeting .... hahaha .... I love our \Work Family ! \ " Someone should have brought along a camera .... maybe next time . :) " 
~ Why do I tire of counting sheep , when I'm far too tired to fall asleep ? ~ Well , goodnight anyway :] 
could either do obnoxiously boring Anatomy studying and then more hw ... or listen to more Chipmunk versions of well-known songs on YouTube . I'm liking the second option .... 
Come to Festy's sometime before noon , whoever you are , and I will paint a picture of a pumpkin on your face with my frozen orange and green paint cubes :) 
MYSPACE : A place for friends . FACEBOOK : A place for creepers . :) It's true , right ? 
is in the mood for some extremely hardcore heavy metal bang-your-head-around ROCK MUSIC !!! Yeah ! Too bad they don't play any at Drugan's . 
is on to bigger and better things . 
is a hostess ! woo hoo !! 
When your day is not going well , or things are not going your way , or people are not behaving the way you wish that they would , or life is treating you poorly in general , listening to a Rush cd has a way of making everything okay :) 
No more untrue rumors , people , really . Talk about good things next time you're bored rather than what you heard somewhere else . Make no more assumptions . It tears friendships apart . Listen to all sides before telling the next person what you heard . Communicate . Hide nothing . Hurt no one . Sure , gossip is fun when it isn't about YOU . But let's save the drama for the stage . This goes for you , you , and you . Yes , You . 
and < PROPFEMALE > are on a spider hunt .... but it's gone ... Now we're trying to distract ourselves with cold cheese pizza and shrimp and music videos and anatomy hw ... but with one of them on the loose , it's nearly impossible to focus .... :o 
had so much fun NHS babysitting with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Lexi :) But OH MY GOD , I hit a frog with my car in the driveway when I got home .... Poor froggy !! 
35 ~ 28 , GO HOLMEN , woo !!! :) :] :) :] <3 
My night = Work , work .... then some more work .. OH YEAH and then some working , and then I came home to check Facebook and change into normal clothes ... and Oh My Gosh , no way , it's time to go back to work and set up for that awesome wedding with < PROPFIRST > Kuenn , some tables , and a whole lotta silverware !! The excitement is killing me .... 
Spongebob and I ? We have a lot in common . We both like blowing bubbles . We both work at restaurants . And recently , I ripped my [ favorite ] pants , just like him ... and I don't think they can be fixed . :( 
loves her best friend too !! ( < PROPFEMALE > ) :] Now time for bed ... school tomorrow ... again . 
doesn't think < PROPFIRST > Mauer is cute , at all . < PROPFEMALE > -- you can have him ! He's all yours . ;) 
is pretty much infuriated that Facebook refuses to acknowledge my newfound relationship with < PROPMALE > Stensgard , but happy that it is true . :) 
is happy because : It's < PROPFEMALE > ; there's no hw ; there's no school ; there's football on ; I have chocolate ; I might very possibly get my hair cut ; and ... it feels like summer has decided to visit us once again :) 
totally just saw the country's number 1 most watched movie with < PROPMALE > ! Only truly scary to those gullible people out there ... like < PROPFEMALE > Jessen :) 
had quite a scare today . Nearly 100% positive I LOST my phone , I came pretty close to having a panic attack after school . It lasted from approximately 3 , when I realized it was missing , to 3:24 pm when I FINALLY found it ... Under my pillow . (???!) 
Happy Friday the Thirteenth ( 13th ) :D What a great day !! 
has just wished three very important people a very happy half-birthday < Jenny , < PROPMALE > , Hannah > , and one person a very happy birthday < Kelsey > . <3 :D 
I , right now , look like a mix between a 3-year-old and a 32-year-old mother who should be named Alice ... or < PROPFEMALE > . Actually ... I look exactly like I did in 5th grade , D.A.R.E. shirt , hair , glasses and all , plus some height and weight and minus the gap in the teeth . Aww , why'd I do it ?!? 
is a procrastinator and proud of it ! :) Also , I kind of miss my hair :( But I still like it ! :) 
You know you're still a kid when at Thanksgiving you sit at a table that is half the height of the one your parents are seated at , and after dinner activities include playing Tigers on the Bed and Team Hide and Go Seek . :) 
Nothing like 5 people under the age of 6 hiding in 1 shower 3 times in a row ! :) 
Hold on to your words , ' cause taaaalllkk is cheap . 
Snow ? What is snow ? Remind me again what you do when it gets all over the road ...? How ' m I supposed to drive good when I can't even see out my windows ????! :o 
< PROPFEMALE > and Dylafer = the two coolest people in the whole world ! :) 
Dear students of Holmen , SNOW DAYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSS ...... :) 
is front < PROPFEMALE > news ? WHOA , I AM :O & :) ! 
:( <--- is me when I hear this song . Aww man , time to find one that makes me --> :) 
Why is it that , for the majority of people , a yellow light really means \Go Faster \"?" 
learned how to snowboard today ... WOO ! :D If you can call it snowboarding , that is .... :P 
DEC . 25th + apple cider + wet , slushy rain-snow + pine scent + cinnamon rolls + ELF + fuzzy slipper socks from Grandma + holiday music + bells + < PROPFEMALE > canes + those ancient/classic 1960s choppy-looking Claymation cartoon TV specials + $100 gift cards + 21 presents each + new We the Kings CD :D + sugar high + happy = Christmas :) 
< PROPMALE > the Elf , what's your favorite color ? 
DATE : Dining And Talking Event ;] 
199-NKU ............. look out . ( ~ shudder ~ ) 
Had a blast scraping a centimeter-thick coating off of my car , had even more fun being pelted by < PROPFEMALE > little pellets when the super high speed wind gusts blew them back at my face and eyes , and especially enjoyed trying to stay on my feet the whole time ... To summarize , I l ? ve ICE . Happy New Year ! :) 
2011 is a beautiful number - I think I'll like this year . :) 
It's a beautiful night\ 
We're looking for something dumb to do\ 
Hey baby ? \ 
I think I wanna marry you ;) \ 
\ 
Sure , < PROPMALE > , I wouldn't mind being Mrs. Mars ! 
is pushing the \like\ " button ... on < PROPMALE > . <3 :) " 
Hey ! It's my one year anniversary ......... of having a FACEBOOK ! Why not celebrate and revisit my very FIRST ever profile picture ? Good idea , me . Good idea :) 
accidentally fell asleep on an armchair after school . I met some very cool people in that dream during my two hour nap . Now I actually miss them ! I'm weird ... 
really kind of dislikes the word , ' scholarships ' right about now ...... ... but is sososososososo glad there's no homework this weekend ! Now I can eat veggie burritos , drink yummy glittery-flavored strawberry non-alcoholic daquiris and do scholarships ALLLLLLLL day :) 
Sometimes things fall apart so that better things can fall together . <3

So , how the *&^%#@$%&!!$%* is Night relevant today ? 
Working for as long as a typical school day . Old women with < PROPFIRST > Swift ringtones . People who think it's cool to STAPLE their tableclothes to their tables . Stressed individuals , all over the place . Eating more than I ever have in nine minutes . Happy Mother's Day ! :) 
Writing writing writing writing writing nonstop : FB Statuses , C . Prep , Stats , Artist Bio , applications for basically everything , notecards , and AP Test in the morning ! Can't wait for 11 days from now ... no more writing !!!

I think far too much . 
I want to go somewhere . I want to go somewhere with < PROPFEMALE > -Cecilia < PROPFEMALE > Corcoran and cheer up about this ... nonsense . Right , < PROPFEMALE > ? 
iSiete meses ! 
If normal people have mood swings , then I must have the whole freakin ' playground . \ 
:( --> :D ..... :/ 
Lo siento . Te amo tanto . <3 . 
I swear I could eat a meal , bake cookies , take a shower and write three graduation ' thank yous ' in the time it takes for THIS computer to travel from one < PROPFEMALE > to the next .... 
Having near-tornadic weather really shows your values ... \ 
There are only so many things you can lug into the basement with you . 
NOTE TO SELF : Don't eat roast beef sandwiches while straightening hair . You WILL choke . 
has a Dark Chocolate Secret and < PROPFEMALE > Jessen won't let me forget it . ;') 
The weather today made it feel like September . College Orientation made me wish it were . Coming home and drawing with chalk all over the driveway till the sun set made me infinitely glad that it isn't . 
\It would be okay for your mom to have a bird at\ 
The summer after 7th grade is repeating itself . Once again , I am completely addicted to SIMS ! :D 
Is officially NOT a MINOR anymore at 12:11 ... Well , in this time zone , 11:11 ... So \Make a wish\ " :) :) ;) " 
What would you think if I sang out of tune , \ 
Would you stand up and walk out on me ? \ 
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song , \ 
And I'll try not to sing out of key . \ 
The <3 Beatles . 
How can I possibly focus on packing for a trip when there are so gosh darn many amazing Beatles YouTube music videos to watch ? It's impossible . I cannot do it . I think this might be .... love . ? 
\In the morning 
I was at the mall today and couldn't decide what to order for lunch . Orange chicken and what else ? The short woman behind the counter gave me some advice : \Do whateva it is that make you happy !!! :D \ " \ 
Has fallen for ... a computer .... I love you my brand new Summer Green < PROPFEMALE > Inspiron !! <3 
Phone : \Press 1 if you'd like to see an idiot press buttons that do absolutely NOTHING ! \ " < PROPFEMALE > Jessen : \ " Okay !!!! \"" 
<3 s m ' buddies , < PROPFIRST > O'Neill and < PROPMALE > Brandsmeier ... And now it's Facebook OFFICIAL !! 
\If she's amazing 
I wish I could go on a trip by myself . To an island or somewhere . By myself . Just for a while . Alone . Just for a little while ... 
Aww man , why is it that I always forget to turn my headlights on when it's dark outside ?? 
\I'm ninety percent sure it's on the other side of over there . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Henderson on Monday the Sixteenth :) " 
Kornfest should really just be renamed : All Middle Schoolers of Holmen and/or Galesville Wear Little to No Clothing , Get Drunk , Travel in Herds of 20+ and Give Out Random \Free Hugs\ " to People they Don't Even Know and Wouldn't Normally Talk to ... Fest . " 
I don't know what has gotten into me , but I am suddenly overcome by the intense urge to get creative .... ;] 
Oh how I missed the soft feeling of that < PROPFIRST > chalk in my hands , the luxurious aroma of the GermX hand sanitizer , and the sweet , sweet sound of the telephone ringing in my ears ...... It's good to be hostessing once again , if only for 4 more days ... :/ 
Funny how one little song can bring back memories you didn't even know you still had .. :/ 
would you stand up and walk out on me ? \ 
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song , \ 
and I'll try not to sing out of key . <3 
Visiting our future home with two of my favorite people ~ The amazing < PROPFIRST > O'Neill and the one and only < PROPFEMALE > Jessen . ... :] 
Gunpowder , gelatine , \ 
dynamite with a laser beam , \ 
guaranteed to blow your mind . \ 
Anytime . :] \ 
< PROPFEMALE > . <3 
HA HA , little brother and sister had to spend seven hours in school today , and I didn't . :) 
Here comes the rain\ 
da da da da\ 
And I say , \It's all right\ " \ 
Is a college student . .... :O 
Readyin ' for our first ever college classes , with < PROPFEMALE > Jessen :) 
Today's quote is : \What the h#*% happens when you find Waldo ? \"" 
? ? I L ? VE d ? ing h ? mew ? rk ? n the day it's due ! Clearly , I'm having an awes ? me time trying t ? f ? cus :] ? ? It's s ? much FUN !!! 
friends are forever , boys are whatever . 
Hypnotist was a pervert ; World Tour was a bit better . Can't wait for our little fiesta de chocolate tomorrow night !! 
Dorm hike all the way up the Granddad's Bluff trails . Kind of exciting but very , very steep ; quite intense ; more than a little scary . 
So last night a drunk guy gave me a hug and said he liked me so much he would stay up all night waiting for me , if only I would promise to come to his dorm and help him eat up his lonely pizza . \ 
... Welcome to college I guess ?? 
Ever heard of gaining the Freshman 150 ? Yeah , that'll probably be me .. 
In the last two days ... \ 
My camera burst into pieces when I dropped it . Oops . \ 
RIP my phone , it got rained on and the screen won't turn anything but white . \ 
My printer ..... it died . :( And my stupid computer won't let me forget it . \Error this 
Yayyy ! My phone works again . :) 
Well , it looks like we might just have to rename our dorm room from \the Reading Room\ " to \ " the Cuddle Corner . \"" 
With the use of a maroon Sharpie , I gave myself highlights today as a part of my paper procrastination process . Are permanent markers flammable ? Am I going to die the next time I straighten my hair ? ... :S 
College Friday nights ... are not very G rated things . 
Life got a little bit better last night , because < PROPFIRST > Stellpflug , < PROPFEMALE > Henderson , < PROPFIRST > O'Neill , & < PROPMALE > Brandsmeier were able to come over and visit me . :] Thanks y'all . 
Hot chocolate with marshmallows and a nap sound like the best things in the world . 
: \I'm going to < PROPMALE > ....... uh 
Just found out through FACEBOOK that my little sister has a boyfriend ! Holy smokes ... 
For some reason , maybe it's the weather , I feel like there are a whole bunch of people out having fun somewhere right now without me ... :S 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY , < PROPFIRST > Lennon . \ 
I can't believe you're 70 today !! \ 
I just heard your music on the radio last night . \Across the Universe\ " was played between a song by Ke$ha and this band Cobra Starship ... Unbelievable . \ 
IT'S 10*10*10 ............... and pancakes in four and a half hours ......... maybe this will be a good day ................ 
\You can turn off the sun 
Ohh if only Ringo < PROPFEMALE > were some 50 years younger ... ;) 
should most likely start going to bed before 3 . 
I want ~ slash ~ need a new camera . My other one died a recent and tragic death in which it literally crumbled to pieces in my own hands . \ 
RIP CanonPowerShotSD790ISDigital Elph <3 
Ever had bronchitis ? I recommend it . It's really fun !!! :D 
--> : I 
It's really nice to get a text from your best friend that makes you -- literally -- \LOL . \ " Especially when you're in class . \ 
Having a nice , lengthy , in-depth \little brothers\ " discussion with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Jessen . Now I miss mine . " 
What a weird , weird night . \ 
Definitely looking forward to getting up tomorrow , because I absolutely cannot wait to study history thee WHOLE day . ( :D ) 
I am < PROPFEMALE > . 
Cry-Fest ..... AKA deep talking , soft sad music , and a number of profound emotional revelations ...... in 426 tonight . There'll be refreshments , near-silent study sessions , group hugs , spontaneous moments of bawling and Kleenex-passing , and overall a good time . :) Wanna join ? 
This evening , I saw my future husband . He was in the Wal*Mart produce section , stocking starfruit and red grapes . ;) \ 
I think I'm going to get groceries there on Monday nights more often . 
Such a mild fever that it's almost comforting in this cold .. 
Sure , thirteen hours of sleep feels amazing , but now the weekend's almost over , and it hasn't been productive at all . Stupid pneumonia . 
I watched Toy Story III . I laughed . :) I cried . :( Cute movie !!!!! 
It's 11/11 today , and I'm gonna be makin ' wishes all day long . ;) 
Hahahahahahahahaa just went to my 7:45 class that was canceled ........................................... Stupid 
In the middle of trying to achieve my goal of cleaning and refreshing my room , catching up on homework and repairing my horrible study habits , and reforming my life , I somehow ended up on facebook . :/ 
HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP ! <3 HP7 here I come ! 
would like to make myself belieeeeeve that planet Earth turns [ slowly ] . It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep .... ' cause everything is NEVER as it seems . \ 
p.s. Oh hey , < PROPFEMALE > Jessen , < PROPFIRST > O'Neill , < PROPFEMALE > Henderson , < PROPFIRST > Searle , and < PROPFIRST > Stellpflug ! ? 
How could it not be a good night when I get to sit by the fireplace in my living room at home and watch my four favorite men sing on the History channel ? \ 
<3 ;) 
My fish LIVED ! \ 
> O :) 
\Space : The seemingly empty space around us . \ " \ 
If a big , fat , hairy man tries to grab you and put you into a bag , don't cry please . I asked for you for Christmas ;) 
Totally just saw a small , < PROPFEMALE > little asteroid -- or whatever else a fiery little ball might have been -- fall from the sky and bounce off the car in front of me ! I'm not crazy ! 
< PROPFIRST > McCartney is on SNL !!!!!!! Yaaayyyyyyyyyyyy ! ...... :D <3 
<3 <3 <3 finals <3 <3 <3 ;D 
I'm sorry , teacher . I'm sorry I made too many \platitudinous generalizations\ " for you to like me . " 
Yo acabo de completar el examen final < PROPMALE > español . El semestre número uno oficialmente ha terminado . Me siento bien ; voy a casa :) 
is rather likin ' this idea of a 33-day weekend :) 
XmasShopping/IceCream/MovieNight/Sleepover at < PROPFEMALE > Henderson ' s house with < PROPFIRST > Stellpflug .... Watching a scary movie that makes me never ever want to look in or own a mirror EVER again ! .... : < .... 
?? < PROPFEMALE > Baby , I want a 2011 four-door Ford Fiesta too . Flame metallic blue . ? 
Sledding <3 \ 
( .. if I can ever pull < PROPMALE > Neumann away from his Halo Xbox game . :/ ) 
Why are circular pizzas packaged in square boxes ??? They're maybe just easier to make that way , sure , but it seems like a whole lot of wasted cardboard to me .. 
I cannot believe that , thank you to < PROPMALE > Mars , my two best friends and I nearly died today . 
is going to be at Drugan's Castle Mound this New Year's Eve ... and you should be , too ! 
\Always -- no 
BROTHER'S WEEK !!!! If you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , and is someone you are very proud to have had in your life , re-post this to your status . I did ! 
Please keep winning , Packers , I'd really kind of like to wear my new jersey of yours to school at least once :) 
Hair-dyeing party with < PROPFEMALE > Jessen ( the BEST person in the whole world !!!!! ) Woo Hoo !! :) ;) 
I don't know why you say \goodbye\ " - I say \ " hello . \"" 
* Overenthusiastic Packer status here * 
\ ... I guess she's an Xbox 
Why is it that women seem to have 17,123,543,897 more kinds of emotions than men do ? It's rather unfair .. 
Looks like it's about time to crawl back into that < PROPFEMALE > little shoebox I call a second home ....... 
My near future includes a snowy sidewalk , a good breakfast , and a new adventure . 
Number of times my English professor said the phrase \with your books\ " in one hour today : 27 " 
is reading a 35-page reading about reading so that I can ace the quiz tomorrow .... on the reading . \ 
I really <3 school 
Somebody has apparently hacked my Facebook account ... and changed my language from English to \English Pirate\ " !! I don't know who did it ... but this is hilarious ! HAHAHAHAHAA ! " 
hurt my ankle this morning , and this afternoon , felt like a lopsided penguin trying to make its way across the frozen tundra to class on the other side of the iceberg ... 
Nearly collided with a pizza guy who was going highway speeds on a corner in Holmen tonight . Well if that's what they mean by a \speedy delivery\ " -- endangering the lives of others -- I'd rather make my own pizza ! " 
I can't guarantee I'll know what's going on , or what just happened in that last play . I can only promise that I'll be cheering right alongside you from where I'm standing in the kitchen , wearing the colors and baking the green and yellow breads . \ 
-anonymous American woman ( much like myself)\ 
Go Packers <3 
.... and now the streets and dorms alike are overflowing with excited , shrieking , semi-obnoxious , green and yellow-wearing , wild hyena-like youths . Guess I couldn't expect anything different :) 
Still awake . Facebooking in a study room significantly warmer than anywhere else in the building . Enjoying the Young Veins : a modern-day Beatles cover band I recently discovered ! Studying . Drinking my bean juice . ( Laughing to self , shaking , possibly intoxicated by bean caffeine ?? ) Accepting that I will get NO sleep tonight , which I am okay with :) ;) 
Claim your happiness ; dance to your own music . ~ Dove chocolate 
Love many\

And always paddle\

More words of wisdom from <3 Dove chocolate <3 
It would be really fun to play Hide and Seek in a big , spacious , empty library ( like this one ) -- at night .

Three exams tomorrow . Did finals week think that just because Spring came early , it could jump in there , too ? 
Fast . Refreshing . Wonderful . Caloric , yet miraculous . Heartbreakingly delicious . Cold . Overall good . Coldstone . 
Weather lady says it's going to look so much like spring tomorrow , that we might even see thunder ! Funny ... I don't remember ever SEEING thunder ... 
A little kindness these days gets you deleted from people's lives - I see how this works . 
just got mauled by a < PROPMALE > bear in a stairwell ! This doesn't happen every day . 
is so glad that our school FINALLY installed the new \hand and face dryers\ " in some of the library bathrooms - for those times when you're studying and suddenly your face just gets wet . I hate it when that happens ! " 
Apparently my 1 mutual friend with the Pillsbury Doughboy is < PROPFEMALE > Crocker . I don't know why that's funny .... haha 
is attending a day of peace this Friday , are you ? [ ? :) <3 ] 
Please , teachers , tell us your political opinions . But please do not tell us whether ours are \right\ " or \ " wrong . \"" 
\Email discussion question for this weekend : Where do you stand on abortion and why ? Feel free to ignore any of your classmates ' comments or things you don't want to read about ... \ " - English professor ( .... Is this even legal ?? lol ) " 
That after-test feeling ... :) 
The first time it got really warm this year , I slipped on the one single ice patch that was left . I would get my car stuck in a snowbank this time .... 
What do < PROPFEMALE > Jessen , Pakula Lo , and I do over our spring break ? \ 
Yes that's right : we go back to high school ! ( at Holmen High School ) ;) 
My parents are screaming at the TV . It's high school basketball , wow . Both are screaming . \TRIPLE OVERTIME !!!!!!!!! \ " Apparently it's a triple overtime . " 
I want a thunderstorm ! 
A calendar came up and told me some wonderful news : It is now Spring . :} 
\I left it right to the left of the bubbler ... hahaha we should ' right ' that down hahaha\ " - Person in Hallway " 
I'd hate to copy Pakula Lo , but I have no choice but to say the same exact thing : blueberry , strawberry , grape ;) Maybe that'll change , someday . <3 
\Fettucine < PROPMALE > is simply macaroni and cheese for adults . \ " -- UW-L email homepage ( didn't know they did daily quotes ' til this one caught my eye ... ) " 
Hates waking up with the sun in my eyes , and a fever in my head . 
It is thee weirdest thing to wake up when it's partly light out with fog everywhere and have absolutely NO idea what time of day it is .. 
feels just like a Claritin commercial , before they peel off the cloudy , fuzzy layer . :/ 
329A Drake Hall next year , YAAAAAAAAYYYYYAAAAAAHHHH !!!!! :D \ 
Glad that's all figured out . No more stressin'! 
Dreamed last night that I dyed my hair bright red ... does that mean I should do it for real ? Hmm . 
Needs a nature hike and a beach day and ice cream and some sun . <3 
is so excited for it to be 70 * AND RAINY this weekend . At least it better be -- the news people promised !! 
Just found out that one of my favorite places in the world is a flooded , muddy mess :/ 
Got my wish ... to be able to make it to the HS musical ! Plus , there's definitely a thunderstorm ! I just hope there's no tornado ... I kind of like having a house to live in D: 
If plants produce so many sugars during photosynthesis , then why aren't vegetables sweet ?? I don't think bio will ever make sense to me .
