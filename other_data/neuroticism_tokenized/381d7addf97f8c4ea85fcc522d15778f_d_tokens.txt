Think the Black Eye Peas are a bit rushed ? 
Why do we have ogt early in the morning ? It should be around 12pm as we would be more awake , and may actually do better on it . Might as well push all the 30min classes ahead as we dont care about 30min classes . \ 
^somehow this should be one of those ogt writing prompts 
finally finish with iqity :) not looking forward to tomorrow :(
