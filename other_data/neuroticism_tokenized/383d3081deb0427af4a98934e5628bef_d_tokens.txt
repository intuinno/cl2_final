Well , another year has gone , and another one has just begun . But the question is ... Will this year be better than the one before ? No one really knows what's going to happen this year , and whether or not it will be an improvement or even worse . All I can really do is continue being the person that I am , and hope that it is enough . 

In three days , I'll be able to get my books from the bookstore , and in eight days , my classes will begin again . God , it's gonna be so great to finally have something worth while running through my brain that isn't confusing me , or compelling me to burst into tears . Hopefully , I will be so caught up in studying for quizzes and exams that everything else that is in my head will be masked . 
Dude , World of Warcraft is definitely ....... interesting . lol 
Motivation such an aggravation , \ 
Accusations don't know how to take them . \ 
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it . \ 
Concentration's never hard to break it . \ 
Situation never what you want it . \ 
Nothing's new , everything's the same . \ 
It keeps on dragging me down , it's getting kind of lame . \ 
I'm falling further behind , there's nothing to explain . \ 
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind . \ 
Motivation - Sum 41 
Off to play World of Warcraft ... -sighs . - 
I feel like I could conquer the world . No , that doesn't mean I'm accepting applications for minions , or anything like that . These past few days have been extremely awesome ! I'm on the top of the world , although , not so literally . College is just around the corner , after receiving the last bit of documents . I wish everyone could feel as pumped and excited as I do . ^_^ 
Looking forward to seeing < PROPMALE > of Persia ! I hope it as good as the games . ^_^ 
Finally registered for college , and God it feels amazing . Better than chocolate or anything else in this world ! I know that one day everything in my life will fall into place where everything should be , including a relationship with someone whom I'll love dearly and share every aspect of life with . So keep holding onto your dreams , for one day they will come true , like mine has . 
I have my Student ID and ready to start my classes on the 16th . Whoo-hoo ! PLus , the title of the textbook for the class I'm taking is Arguing Across the Discipline , How cool is that ? You may have noticed that I get excited over the strangest things , at least strange to some people . I'm quirky and love-able . 
Listening to the rain pouring outside my door , wondering if there is more to this life , than just being successful ? 
Why give up , why give in ? \ 
It's not enough , it never is\ 
So I will go Until The End\ 
We've become desolate\ 
But I will go on Until The End . 
Going down to < PROPMALE > for a Memorial Day BBQ !! Whoop ! I'm going to be able to see family that I haven't really seen much since I've moved to Newark . I'm also glad everyone in my family can actually talk civilly to one another , without getting the cops called . LOL . Even my mom and my Aunt < PROPFIRST > are getting along . Nobody jinx it . 
The BBQ was awesome and my mom surprised me with baking me a cake for getting into college and achieving my GED . Things may not have been great between my mom and I in the past , but that is all behind us . Although I am gifted , I am also weird unlike the patch says . 
It feels good to be back in Newark . ^_^ Just 15 days until my classes start . Can I get a whoop-whoop ? 
Just 13 more days until classes being . I'm getting more excited by the minute . ^_^ * Does more happy dancing . * 
You may not feel like you're exactly clicking with anything today , Sagittarius . Adjustments will need to be made either by you or the people you're dealing with for any resolution to come about . Your emotions may feel tied to the ground , yet your mind may want to take off into the stratosphere . Dilemmas between whether to take action or stay passive could leave you paralyzed . Just go with the flow . 
The suspense is killing me , waiting for my classes to begin . 
Six more days until my classes begin , ^_^ I love doing this little countdown . At least , when I think of it , LOL 
I just tried on a pair of shorts that normally wouldn't have fit when I first moved to Newark , and they fit !!! ^_^ I'm so thrilled . I don't normally get this excited over losing weight , cause it never happens so easily . Another piece of evidence proving that my life is moving in an upward direction . ^_^ 
3 More days until I'm sitting in a classroom ready to soak up some knowledge . ^_^ Like a sponge and hopefully make my brain more wrinkled than it already is . Yes , knowledge makes your brain wrinkly . 
Hooray for new computers !! I feel like a little kid at Christmas . ^_^ Tehehehehe . 
After watering the pepper and tomato plants that are growing on our balcony , it just made me really grateful of the awe-inspiring power of nature and life itself . I enjoy watching the peppers grow day by day , and one day to become nourishment . I can't believe how big the banana peppers have gotten since we planted them on the 5th of June . ^_^

Tomorrow is the first day of class , I'm so excited ! ^_^ 
Whoo-hoo ! Sitting in the computer lab at the college . God , it feels great to be a college student . 
Release yourself , tired from crying\ 
Your prayers are communicated now\ 
So move toward the future that's started to move\ 
The road still continues on and on endlessly\ 
Take it if you want\

Third night of class ... Hopefully , we won't get sent home after 20 minutes of waiting for the instructor to show up . And they say third time is the charm . ( Hopefully , it can be applied to more ways than just one -Sighs . -) 
I really enjoyed class last night , it was very entertaining and imformative . And so it turns out , that I have some skills of a Critical Thinker already , LOL . Open-mindedness , attention to detail , and great sense of vocabulary . I'm gonna do well in this class . YAY Go Me !! ^_^ 
And when you feel the heat . The world is at your feet\

No one can hold you down . If you really want it\ 
Just steal your < PROPFEMALE > . Right from the hands of fate\

How many of us really know everybody on our FB friends\ 
list ? Heres a task for you ... I want all my FB friends to post how \ 
you met me , no matter how you met me . After you comment , copy this to\ 
your status . You'll be surprised at the respones you get . Enjoy 
I can honestly say that I feel truly happy with my life at the current moment . Everything may not be as perfect as other people I know , but it feels perfect to me . I have college , good friends ( who on occassion kidnap me . ) and a sense of where my life is headed . I sometimes wish I had someone I could share my happiness with , but that's what friends are for . This is my epiphany . 
Went swimming at < PROPFEMALE>'s and < PROPMALE>'s house today . And it is so much fun watching drunk people climb onto an inflatable orca and get knocked into the water , even I joined in on that crazy fun . No one seemed to be able to tame the orca . ^_^ Drunken pool parties are so much fun . 
I know this pain\ 
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains ? \

Don't ever let anyone step all over you\

Fall classes are startting soon , and I'm gonna be taking more classes this semester . I'm a little nervous about my chemistry class , first chemistry class . All I need is some encouraging words from some good friends , to get my ass in gear , lol It's not easy making the right choices in life , I know that . But I'm happy that my life is taking a turn for the better . 
WAHOO !! I feel good , der ner ner ner ner ner . I knew that I would der ner ner ner ner . So good ber ber . So good , ber ber . I got you . I love that song , but I hated the fact that they used it for a laxative commercial . >.< I guess it would be appropriate . -Shudders . - But I digress , I feel great being in college , and I know that the people who read these are going , \Shut up already ! \ " ^_^ "

I hate getting sick , Ick ! But at least it was during the weekend and not during the week where I would miss any class time . Gonna take some more NyQuil and hopefully get some much needed rest . 
I love proving \ 
stereotypes wrong . Who says women are always the ones playing \Damsels \ 
I didn't think it was possible to enjoy < PROPFEMALE > Trek any more than I already do . Wrong ! Although I thought that episode was going to be the one where Captain Picard becomes assimilated , but it was fantastic . 
I found THE most awesomest drink ever ... Dunkin Donuts Coolata with coffee and vanilla bean flavoring topped with whipped cream . Like an orgasm in your mouth . YUMM ! ( As you can tell , I had a good day today . ) 
Love is such a wondrous and mysterious thing , isn't it ? So wonderful being in love , yet at the same time painful . ' Course that all depends if the person that the love is directed to feels the same way or at least understands why . I have had both experiences with love and it never changes . But I also have a heart filled with love ready to give it to someone I feel is worthy of receiving it and I always will . 
After checking my e-mail , I noticed that there was a word of the day from Dictionary.com, how this came to be ? IDK . The word was nympholepsy meaning frenzy of emotion , as for something unattainable . Yes , I know that it is wiser to move on and forget , but this brain of mine does not allow easy forgetfulness . Which sucks . 
Another day , another cup of coffee to fuel it . I was the one to wish for cooler weather , and I got it just didn't expect there to be rain attached to it . But good coffee always helps . 
had the greatest time at < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding !! Getting the bouquet , singing for < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > , sort of winning the center piece , and drinking lots of RUM ! <3 It was fantastic ! I even had back-up snappers !

I'm always amazed by autumn , the beautiful colors of the leaves . Every Tuesday and Thursday morning on my walk to school , I just bask in the awesomeness that comes with the changing of the seasons , especially Autumn . Probably something that most people take for granted . I implore you , just to take a moment and enjoy the scenery in the morning . You will be amazed . 
I feel like a lil kid again !! Woo ! Who knew that singing Karaoke with good friends held some secret fountain of youth . Especially < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s \Don't Go Breaking My Heart\ " with < PROPFIRST > which I nailed . "

Tonight's chemistry lecture was the best one in the whole fall semester , talking about cell damage as a result of radiation , nuclear fusion and fission , and a discussion about using more nuclear power plants . After learning some maddening truths about what the government is supposed to be doing with the nuclear waste that is costing us $400 million a year !!!! WHAT THE HELL ?!? 
HAPPY TURKEY DAY TO ALL ! 
Phew .. the dinner today wasn't as bad as it could have been . Some drama , can't wait until a month from now so we can do it again . lol 
I see nothing wrong with writing down one's thoughts and opinions , that is why it is stated in the < PROPMALE > of Rights , blogs and diaries were created for that purpose . However , there is nothing wrong with relying on a friend to help with rampaging thoughts that never seem to cease . I will always be there for a friend , even if it's just a hug and a listening ear . 
Life is gonna be tough , we all should remember we were cold naked then slapped by the 1st person we came in contact with , this should have clued us all in . 
Ever had those dreams where they are just like little movies in your head ? But I hate it when they get to the good part in the dream , you wake up . >.< It's like falling asleep during the best part of the movie . I wanted to see if the humans will stand a < PROPMALE > against the machines . ( Yes , it was a Terminator-like dream ) Strange thing was , I have not watched that movie in a long time . 
This is just one of those days , where I wanna yank my hair out and scream . I hate when my mind makes me feel like there is nothing worth living for , which I know is complete bullshit . But oh well , I shall keep on living and being the good person I know I am . I will find what I'm looking for , even if I don't know what it is yet . 
Wow , despite the fact that I woke up late , I was still on time for class . Is the universe finally deciding to help those who need it ? Or do we just blame it on bad or good traffic ? Considering the fact that 95 was bumper to bumper , I'm gonna say that everything is late today . lol 
If there was one thing I wish FaceBook would change would be the question \What's on your mind ? \ " for the status update bar . It is really starting to bug me . " 
Yeah , I'm weird . So ? If you don't like me , you don't HAVE to be my friend , or talk to me for that matter ... I am who I am and will change for no one .

How is that I feel less energized after a night of sleep which involves REM , the deepest part of sleep ? I know that I enter REM almost every night now because I'm dreaming again . It just feels like my body is using more energy to actually to keep me asleep . I don't know . And being this tired only makes my restless mind worse , as if I didn't have enough on it with finals and everything . Any advice ?

You know what . Friday is my birthday and I'm gonna treat myself to a nice quiet dinner . I deserve something good in my life , even if I'm going by myself . Maybe this is something that'll make you think \Who cares ? \ " but I think I'm coming to terms with my loneliness . What's the point of worrying about finally having someone who will take the time to understand me ? All I ever get is heartache and more sleepless nights . " 
Ok , I encourage all of you to find something in this world that'll make you fall out of your chair laughing . Not only does it make you feel better , scientifically proven to prevent heart attacks . SO , what are you waiting for . START LAUGHING !!!! 
How I love to laugh ! Thanks < PROPFIRST > ! <3 Our plan to overthrow the evilness that is Wal-Mart 
As always I am the last to know , but for now I will share my thoughts on the people in my life . You know the drill , at least you should by now .

This was a good birthday ! Definitely better since I didn't spend it alone . We watched < PROPMALE>'s World 1&2 , Airplane , and Spiderman with cake and ice cream . It was full of laughter ! Exactly how I wanted it to be . 
I HATE shopping for clothes ! >.< Nothing I ever like fits ... back to wearing t-shirts and blue jeans !

Let me get this straight - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , while < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods were screwing EVERYTHING , yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Repost to your < PROPFEMALE > if you ... agree . Proud to support equal rights for ALL !! 
just finished watching the season finale of < PROPMALE > . Great stuff ! 
I need a cuddle bug ..... Brrrrrrr ... >.< 
I would eat some of the ice cream left over from my birthday party , but it's too frickin cold !! >.< Why couldn't I have been born in a warmer month ? July , perhaps ?

has decided to be a comedy junkie . Has been the only way to quiet my raging mind , since I've been void of human contact for the most part . I know you guys are still there , so don't worry about me . ' Cause when I'm laughing I don't think about what is really bothering me . Why it keeps coming back , I don't know . 
Could someone knock me upside the head with a mallet please ? 
Why the hell do so many people insist on toying with people ? Using them for only the moments that they are needed , and as for the rest of the time , completely and utterly ignored . I HATE it . Not only has it been done to me , I've seen it done to the people I care so much about . Makes me wanna grab a bat and beat the living shit out of all those heartless bastards ! 
I really need something to do , or at least something that gets me out of the house . It's happening again , I can't even remember what day it is . o.o 
UGH ! I'm getting a migraine ... Whoopie ! >.< 
Food for thought : What do you think your life would have been like if you were the same age as you are now during the year that you were born ? 
I just stopped and realized that I have been in Newark for a whole year , and I can remember everything that happened that led me here so clearly . Some good and some not so good . But what really matters is that I know where I am headed , and what I want from my life . 
Why can't I just put my brain on mute just long enough for me to fall asleep ? I'm so tired , but can't fall asleep since I think about everything at once . How I feel , what has happened , what could happen , what will happen , what I wish would happen . It's too much for me sometimes . It feels like my head is going to explode . 
The best way to spend Christmas Eve : Watch the < PROPFEMALE > Trek : TNG marathon on Syfy with my brother and mom while reminiscing about my childhood . ^_^ I couldn't be happier . 
After watching the first part of the < PROPFEMALE > Trek : TNG marathon , we watched Horton Hear a Who by Dr. Seus , which got me thinking about universe and everything contained therein . To us , this planet is huge , but we are only a fraction of the vastness that is the universe . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone ! 
Another holiday come and gone , and this time , there's wasn't any confrontation amongst the relatives which was nice . And DJ was there , and we just sat upstairs and talked after the presents were exchanged . 
Christmas went well , so why am I feeling like the Grinch ? 
< PROPMALE > Saves Christmas !! 
Normally , I don't care too much for snow , but seeing it on the ground makes me feel happy . It's so beautiful . 
My body is telling me that is time to get some sleep , but the funny thing is that I won't fall asleep . I'm so sick of not being able to get a decent amount of sleep due to the hyperactivity of my brain . If the thoughts that ran through my brain didn't cause me such pain and confusion , it wouldn't not be so bad . Is there any hope of being able to rid myself of this dilemma ? 
It feels good to be back home , sitting in front of my own computer ... just my luck I'd get a kink in the neck from all of the bad sleep I've been having lately . 
I need a good shoulder rub ... >.< 
I think I might go back downstairs and finish watching the Sorcerer's Apprentice . 
If I can't get out of this house on a regular basis , due to certain unfortunate circumstances that sums up my life , I would like to have someone that could come over and talk . More or less , I want human contact with someone who can hear what I have to say and not be judgmental . A hug or two would be nice as well . 
I need Milk Duds ... 
Oh how I love The Big Bang Theory ! 
Dude , I love Hot Topic !! :D 
-Strangles FaceBook . - 
I love playing World of Warcraft ....... Why ? Because when I play I DON'T think anything at all . And that is the best news I've had in a long time . It feels like so much pressure has been lifted off of me . 
Never underestimate the power of a hug from a good friend . I may not have been feeling as crappy as I have been for the last couple of weeks , but getting a hug from a good friend will always improve my mood . Even having all of my books in three-ringed < PROPFEMALE > format ( except for my psychology book ) has no sway over me . 
You and I wake up in jail . Using only four words , what do you say to me ? Note : to play along you must post this as your status so that I may comment as well !!! 
-Takes a good look around . - And again the laws of science are against me . Must clean the room . 
If I get one more book that has to be put into a giant three-ringed binder , I'll scream ! >.< What a hassle that was . 
I should so rent Stargate again !! God , I miss that movie . 
The nightmare that I had last night makes me wish that I had a method of extracting and deleting memory files for my brain . I haven't had a nightmare in years ( Thank God for that ) but this one actually made me wake up shaking , it was so disturbing . And the funny part is that it started out great , but like everything else in my life , it will eventually fall apart at the seams . I'm such a optimist , ain't I ? 
Today turned out to be a pretty good day . DJ came over and brought some Captain < PROPFIRST > ( just for me , ^_^ ) Made some sloppy < PROPFIRST>'s and baked some cookies , while laughing our asses off watching Grown Ups . That is one HILARIOUS movie . 
My first anatomy and physiology class is in 31 hours . 
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear\ 
And I cant help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer\ 
It's driven me before , it seems to have a vague\ 
Haunting mass appeal\ 
Lately I'm beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel\ 
... Whatever tomorrow brings , I'll be there\ 
With open arms and open eyes yeah\ 
Whatever tomorrow brings , I'll be there , I'll be there

The Wrath of Khan , The Search for Spock , < PROPFEMALE > Trek : Generations , < PROPFEMALE > Trek : Nemesis , etc . Awesome ! Yes , I'm a geek , dork , nerd , whatever . But I am completely happy with who I am , it's everyone else that has a problem with it . 
Well , it's time to kick start this semester . I'm ready for it , BRING IT ON ! 
Damn it ! Why the hell can't I sleep on sleeping cycle that won't make me feel so worn out all of the damn time ? Seems like I can only get a decent amount of sleep during the day when I'm supposed to be in class , and awake all night when I should be asleep . Arrrggh ! 
Just got out of my Psychology class , I'm so gonna love this class . Plus , I get to see < PROPMALE > the Border Collie/mascot . lol The tests are gonna be online , multiple choice , and open book , what more could I ask for ?

does not want college to be canceled or delayed due to snow that just won't go away .

Epic Fail ! Snow is too powdery to make a snow man . 
FaceBook : it's an addiction without the high . 
The complexity of the human brain and mind will always continue to fascinate me . I mean , how I can remember something that happened almost twenty years ago , but can't remember what day it is in the present . 
I have a college GPA of 3.69 , which is awesome ! :D 
Even better college news , there's a good < PROPMALE > I'll be tutoring math at < PROPMALE > ! ' Course it depends on the result of my first exam , since it is college algebra , it shouldn't be hard to get a great score on it . 
Nothing soothes the soul better than acquiring massive amounts of music ! Take that , whatever reminded me what I had for dinner last night ! 
Fate is so unkind\

Overburdened - Disturbed 
I think I might just keel over from the boredom of not having much to do between classes . Time is an amazing thing sometimes , how it can seem to accelerate and decelerate at certain moments in our lives . Right now , I wish it would accelerate , so I can go to my math class . ^_^ I don't know if I could tell you which class I like better , Anatomy&Physiology , Psychology , or Math . They are all thrilling in their own way . 
Do you ever have those dreams where you wake up crying ? It's like my mind delights in showing me what I wish I had , and then I wake up snapping back into reality knowing that it isn't there . Why is it so hard to tell the person , or people , that you care about how you truly feel ? It's like whatever I'm feeling has no place in this world . 
WOO ! Maybe it's the < PROPFEMALE > Pepsi , but I'm feeling , as < PROPFIRST > the Tiger would say ...... GRRRRRRRRREAT ! 
loves math ! 
LOL ! I loved the look on my cats face when I kept blowing bubbles with my gum , she started looking around the room for the source of the pop . It took her four pops to figure out that I was the one making the noise . 
Wants to know how long it will take before someone can build a transporter . 
LOL ! I was working on some math problems , and I lost my pencil . It was behind my ear the whole time ! :P 
-Looks outside and sees nothing but white . - When does it end ? >.< 
It's amazing how long a weekend might feel to be away from something you are used to seeing everyday , but not enough time to study exams and such . lol I think I did pretty well on my exams , might have mixed up a few things here and there , but essentially I feel I did good . So YAY me . 
I swear to god , this social network is absolutely horrible ... Glitches out the wazoo . If it weren't for the games that I enjoy so much , I'd delete my FaceBook profile altogether . I hardly ever use it anymore except to play the games and talk to the few people who actually have a conversation with me . And that list is so small , it's sad . And those of you who actually will respond back to me , you know who you are . 
Dooo doo < PROPFIRST > doo ... just sitting in my non-subterranean bat-cave aka my room . 
WOO !! I got a 92 on my math test !!! :D Since the outcome of the math test will determine whether or not I'll be able to tutor at < PROPMALE > . So getting an \A\ " on the math test will surely be enough to tutor math ! Another big ass smiley face . " 
So I got the letter of recommendation from my math instructor , now all that is left is to fill out the rest of the paper work so I can tutor math at < PROPMALE > ! I'm so frickin excited , I just can't hide it . lol XD 
Who would have thought that being a math tutor at college would be this exciting ? And doing something I love to do AND getting paid to do it , it just blows my mind . 
I wear makeup so i'm fake . I like to dress up so I love myself . I say what I think so i'm a bitch . I cry sometimes so i'm an attention seeker . I talk to men so i'm a slut . I stand up for myself so i'm mouthy . I like food so im fat ! Seems like u can't do anything these days without being labeled , so label me cuz I don't give a shit !!!! Post this as your status if you're PROUD of who you are ! 
Now the games on FaceBook are mocking me with their heart-shaped patterns . Why do I always feel like I'm the one that is always on the outside of everything ? Like a child staring into a < PROPFEMALE > store wanting so much to satisfy that longing inside . It seems like I have to keep reminding myself that I'm a good person just to get through this lousy month with all the lovers walking around me everywhere I go . 
Where's my fricking rum ? Oh , yea . I drank it all . >.< Time to go get some more . 
You know how I am spending V-day ? In college taking exams and when I get home , probably gonna sleep . Yesterday was pretty fun , watched the third season of the Big Bang Theory with my uncle and DJ . But I did get some V-day < PROPFEMALE > , which made my day . 
I'm loving the warm weather today , but I'm still getting those light headaches . >.< I can't win , can I ? Either I'm freezing my ass off or it feels like my skull is imploding . 
What do you call the people that you tutor ? I think I'm just gonna refer to them as my clients . :P 
-Shakes head . - What is my problem ? I know this stuff so why was I tripping all over myself when I was tutoring ? Maybe since it's been so long since I've actually sat down and worked those kinds of problems . Good thing I still remember how to work algebra problems , since my class has advanced algebra in it . 
Good to see that the computers at the college operational once again , now I can amuse myself while waiting for my classes to begin . 
Epic weather fail ! Just as I was growing accustomed to the ground finally being free of snow .... BOOM ... more snow . >.< 
We all know that life is full of its ups and downs , and today is a prime example of one of the ups . 
Is anyone out there as bored as I am right now ? 
Just finished my Midterm Lab Pratical , did some double-checking and I SO ruled it !! Who knew Anatomy and Physiology would be so easy . 
OMG ! The Battle of the Bands so totally rocked ! :D 
Since I have no idea if exams are going to stay spaced apart like this , I'm enjoying the time I have to relax and catch my breath(metaphorically . ) 
I think the soda companies are lying to us ! Diet < PROPFEMALE > Pepsi is supposed to be sugar free , then why do I feel like I could run a marathon ? Either way Diet Pepsi just tastes better than regular Pepsi , and the reverse for Coke products . Am I the only one who thinks that ? 
Sometimes I feel like the classes that I am taking are too easy . It doesn't take much effort to maintain an A in each class . I knew that math was gonna be a walk in the park for me , but Psychology and Anatomy are becoming as easy and natural as breathing . 
Dude , I only have one tutoring appointment tonight . I need more clients , LOL . 
My agenda for today : Sit down with some Dr. Pepper , Chex Mix and the < PROPFEMALE > Trek that I never finished ( Courtesy of Delaware Tech ) 
is probably gonna spend the rest of her weekend going over Anatomy notes and listening to music . 
FaceBook is duplicating my friends again . lol 
You know , maybe I have fell off the edge of the planet , metaphorically . I've been so out of touch with people I used to be very close to . Hopefully , things will change and I will have more time for the people that are important in my life . 
It's almost 3:30 and I'm wide awake and ready for school . Is there something wrong with this picture ? Since I don't have to leave for another 3 hours . 
Just as I predicted , I fell asleep in class . >.< Functions of exponents , and it wasn't hard really . Just the power of my exhaustion was over-whelming . 
Well , thanks to not having to take my math midterm , I have a free day on Friday . WOO ! The question remains : What am I gonna do with the free time ? 
>.< I surprise myself sometimes . I know that soda and mint don't mix , and yet I still do it ! lol 
MEOW ! XD 
WAAHHH ! I was hoping that my Anatomy exam would have been graded by now . 
Ick . My feet are all squishy and squeaky when I walk . I can never sneak up on anyone this way . 
It never dawned on me how truly weird it is to be a state of Delaware employee . Most of the time , state employees just get by with the bare minimum work for the same amount of pay expected from everyone who are working their butts off . That doesn't mean I'm gonna turn out like that , regardless of how much I get paid , I will perform my job with optimum quality 
I have a feeling that this will be a great weekend . It usually is when the family comes up for a visit , and it's nice having better relationships with the family . 
I feel so blah . Not sure why . The weekend was good , and tomorrow is gonna be an interesting day in lab . So why do I feel so ... ick ? 
My hands smell like a couple of balloons , and no matter what I do , it won't go away ! >.< 
It is so nice outside , even got me out of me hoodie . lol 
Today's psychology class was another good , but no shocker there . We're in the chapter dealing with personality and what makes us who we are . Our desires and our conscience . ' Course my group had to be the superego , which was a lot of fun .

-Loves logarithms . - Sooooooo easy . 
I need to get out of the house and do something . -Sighs . - 
I found myself lost in my head today , not really thinking about anything in particular , just a random assortment of different ideas and whatnot . 
Because my grades are ..... EXCELLENT , I have been invited to join the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society , the < PROPFEMALE > Zeta Kappa Chapter ! ^_^ Just made my day ! Probably cause it feels great to be recognized for my hard work . 
-Snores . - ZZzzzzzZZZZzzzzZZZZZzzzzZZZZzzzzz

I've said this before and I'll say it again , I LOVE my Psych class ! After going over the psychological stages of development and realizing my father left ( which is what I'm gonna call it because I lived with my mom for the majority of my life . ) during my Phallic stage of development . 
Do you ever get the feeling that whenever you try to say something , you can never get it out quite right ? And when you can finally get everything out , no one is there to listen ., save for a certain few that you'd classify as true friends . Sometimes I wonder who those people truly are . 
BORED ! 
I'm so ready to kick this math exam's ass ! BWHAHAHAHAHA !! XD 
Someone please explain to me why this is .... I go to bed at 9 or 10 , and feel like i haven't gotten any sleep . But when I go to bed at 12:30 or 1 , I feel energeized like I can take on the world . 
Even though some of the videos we watched in Psychology caused me to question the ethics of the experiments , it made me realize how faulty we are as humans . Sometimes I question our right to survive as a species , when we can be so cruel and vindictive . Though , at the same time there are some people who would be more than willing to shoulder another person's pain . 
Hmm ... Bobble heads sitting in a pimped out car with hydraulics . SWEET ! 
Whatever happened yesterday , I need to do it again ! I actually woke up at noonish instead of 7 , meaning much needed sleep ! :D 
Dear winter , Just let it go , your time is over ! Kthanks . 
MUST ... HAVE ... COFFEE ! 
YOU JUST WOKE UP NAKED IN MY BED NEXT TO ME .... using only 3 words . What would you say to me ? Note : If you comment you must copy and paste this as your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport . Play along . 
Brrrrr .... so cold . 
As much as I love sitting in the college library and playing tetris , sitting in those chairs too long makes my ass hurt ! >.< 
I highly recommend that anyone listen to music in the shower , since it enhances the already invigorating soothing power of hot water . :D 
Can't sleep . What else is new ? 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
Ribbit .
