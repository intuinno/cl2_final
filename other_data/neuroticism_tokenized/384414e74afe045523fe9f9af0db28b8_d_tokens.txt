The things have a weird way for turning out well ... 

just loves the rain outside . It's warm and smells good ! :) Unbelievable , it's still summer . 
I hate mornings !!! 
you can only push yourself so much ... 
Netflix is so addicting ... 
GC550 ... Wake me up when September , no , December ends ... 
It sucks to be sick . :( 
I love Dr. < PROPMALE > Cooper ! 
I hate Thermo papers . Apparantly , our professor has a way to kill everybody . I have definitely met his way to kill me . 
I love rain ... When it's on the other side of the window . 
I wish today would never end ! 
The weekend was almost too good to be true , now - time to get real . Unfortunately . 
Curiouser and curiouser ... 
Shitty Friday . Wonna dive in a good book and forget everything else ever even existed . 
Happy Samhain ! :) 
Pleaseput this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone)who has AUTISM . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand autismis not a disease ; people with autism are not looking for a cure but forACCEPTANCE ...... it will make this status for at least one hour .
