“The men of the East may spell the stars , /And times and triumphs mark , /But the men signed of the cross of Christ/Go gaily in the dark . \ " , 201 0-0 6-12 08:29:11 "

\Thank Heaven ! the crisis -- \ 
\ ... And neither the angels in Heaven above\ 
\The skies they were ashen and sober ;\ 
Went ice skating ( only fell down twice ! ) and had In-N-Out for dinner ... can life get any better ? I submit that it cannot ! Dies carpatur ! 
\A severed foot is the ultimate stocking stuffer . \"" 
Just got my grades ... they're letting me come back this semester ! \Give thanks to the Lord for he is good ! \""
