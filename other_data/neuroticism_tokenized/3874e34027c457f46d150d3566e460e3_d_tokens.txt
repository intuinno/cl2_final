Yay ! I Can Get On Facebook Again ! 
so i was standing at my bus stop yesterday , and the wierdest thing happened . Im Listening to my ipod , and i suddenly hear this really loud screaching . i look up and a tire rolls past me . it continues to roll across the entrance to my street , hits the curb on the other side , flies ten feet into the air , lands , and bounces to a stop in the woods . ended up being some cars left rear . dont see that every day . 
Tomorow is My Birthday , and while i am excited to be turning 18 , it is a big responsibility , but i cant think of a better way to begin the day then with a meteor shower . hopefuly it is not a bust . well thanks to everyone who remembered , and everyone who will remember . Thanks everyone .

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
Of all the things on earth , a friend is by far the most valuable . \ 
Thank you to all who are here and have been here in times past . \ 
May your lives be blessed as you have blessed me .
