He's the one who like all our pretty songs and he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun but he don't know what it means , he don't know what it means ... :| 
This is where the healing begins , oh , this is where the healing starts ! When you come to where your broken within , the light meets the dark ! :) God is awesome !!! 
I'm halfway here , but don't take too long ! Cuz I'm halfway gone , I'm halfway gone ! ~ * ~ Halfway Gone - Lifehouse ~ * ~ 
One tear in the dropping rain , one voice in a sea of pain , could the maker of the stars hear the sound of my breakin ' heart ? >>> Hold My Heart - Tenth Avenue North <<< 
Its something unpredictable , but in the end is right . I hope you had the time of your life . 
He's not perfect but he doesnt need to be . He's lost himself inside his dreams . He's left the world & what it means for something somewhere in bewteen . > I wrote this one ! < 
call your name everyday when I feel so helpless ... I'm fallin ' down ... but I'll rise above this ... rise above this doubt ... -Seether

I'm in Tuscaloosa and gonna be here for a few days ... idk how long ... but yeahh not gonna be online much til I get back 2 Atmore < PROPFEMALE > yeahhh 
When you really love someone ... and you know theres nothing you can do about it anymore ... you have to let them go . No matter how much it hurts . Let them be happy ... 
Going back to Atmore tomorrow ... hmm ... ( thinking about a lot of things ... ) 
I'm back from Tuscaloosa ! Yay ?

SOMETHING INTERESTING !!! \ 
:P 
lol yay I just turned 19 11 mins ago !!! :D I feel so old now ... xD But yeah ... My birthday party thing is gonna be Sept . 4th ! Anybody who wants to come send me a message :D 
Just got done making a cd for my b-day party on Sept 4th . Music genre is mostly rock . ( would've been more genres if I could have fit more songs :| ) Anyone who wants details on where/what time , message me !!! :D 
Hmm ... I wonder ... 
I can't believe I fell for that again ... thanks for the lies . 
Nothing is what it seems . Losing your heart leads to poisonous dreams . Breaking away from a mind that you hate , can lead to losing your feelings . Its too late . 
... yay for borderline personality disorder ?... mhm . Its nice when you can't keep yourself together . Whatever though . 
\I'm trying to hold it together\ 
I'm sorry I've got problems ... I've been trying to work them out . I don't want another < PROPMALE > . I just want you to understand that that wasn't me ... its part of my problem ... believe it if you want to ... don't believe it ... I'm just trying to make it right . I know you don't care . 
I have to go do stuff for my Ethics class later . Thats gonna be fun . 
What I really meant to say ... is \I'm sorry for the way I am . \ " Never meant to be so cold ... \ 
I'm just gonna do what I need to do before I worry about anything else . Thats the best thing that can be done . 
Watching a movie with my g/prnts :) I'll be back on L8r . 
Yay !!! McR has a new album ! o.O I want it !!! lol :D 
Had fun @ Wal-Mart && Skating Rink in Bay Minette :D Met a random person O.o xD 
I'm never gonna dance again . These guilty feet have got no rhythm . Though its easy to pretend , I know your not a fool ... I'm never gonna dance again ... the way I danced with you . 
I bleed ... and I breathe no more . \ 
- Evanescence 
Tell me when you hear me falling ... theres a possibility I wouldn't know . \ 
( Music keeps the world spinning ) 
@ college waiting for class . :P \ 
Fun . 
\Things to get at the grocery store :\ 
DaNaNaNaNa Forces of Eviiil ! :D 
I'm in a really good mood now ! :D \ 
Even though my mp3 is rejecting my headphones at the moment x.O BUT STILL !!! :D :D :D 
Your a brick in the wall , a face in the crowd , a broken soul that I can't figure out . Your the reason I've fallen too many times to count ... --- to be continued ? ( By Me ) 
Just dance ... It'll be ok . 
Am I lost or am I found ? \ 
In this pond of shame I'll drown , \ 
I'll climb your tower from the dock , \ 
and then I'll jump from the very top . 
Come into the shadows , where life fades into gray . \ 
Blindness comes from brightness , and light is not the way . \ 
All I've ever wanted is what I'll never get . \ 
Let the world come crawling in , when I am nothing ... 
Something different this way comes . 
The world cannot be saved through beauty , for beauty only hides flaws and mistakes . It cannot heal . The world can only be saved through love , and love is fading away ... 
I'm not a < PROPMALE > , and this ain't a < PROPFEMALE > tale ... and its too late for your white horse to come around . 
I think I'm gonna spend next week writing a song ... I know it takes most people months ... but it will be a challenge that I will love ! :D 
Its not worth it :P \ 
( Exited about being in a real band for once ... possibly ! :D ) 
Met some REALLY awesome people yesterday @ the mall !!! :D 
Today was fun ! :D I believe I defended my title of \Super Smash Bros . Master\ " very well ! :D ( Though it was a very even battle ! ) For the N64 version at least . o.O " 
Got my laptop back today ! :D 
>>> TOP SECRET <<< (So why am I announcing it on facebook ? )\ 
I'm going to put another ... video of me ... singing ... on ... youtube ... sometime ... soon ... but it will be ... an original song ... o.o ... Be afraid . Be fairly afraid ... 
Every time I close my eyes\ 
I lose my breath to empty lies\ 
The world that broke me from the inside\ 
has fallen apart and become a charade\ 
a mask of happiness , stop the parade 
I'm the boy anachronism ! <3 
Ethics Final was fun ... lol\ 
Not as hard as I expected it to be ! I actually think I definitely passed !!! :D 
The darker the night , \ 
the swifter the tides . \ 
Thunder above an indefinite sky . \ 
Silence from shadows , \ 
who watch in disgust . \ 
For this is a place they can no longer trust ... 
\The world is full of singers 
Disappearances can be deceiving ... <3 
No one can reach me in my tower ;\ 
it reaches far beyond the moon . \ 
Everyone who tries shall cower ;\ 
dragons roam in every room . 
All I'll ever wish to be\ 
is part of you\ 
and all of me ... 
Nothing I can do . A total eclipse of the heart . - < PROPFEMALE > Tyler\ 
</3 = Forever . 
All I want for Christmas ... is what I'll never get . </3 \ 
And I'm okay with that . Love is over-rated !!!
