Going to have a fabulous dinner at < PROPFEMALE>'s . 

Feeling the Christmas spirit . 
Have a fabulous holiday . 
We got quite a bit of snow yesterday and this morning , but I'd like to see another foot so I can have the day off . But wait , I only live 3 blocks from work ... Make that 2 feet . 
I feel like I'm playing hookie , but I guess that is why I have over 140 hours of PTO . I'm going to take it easy for the next couple of days and tell myself that 43 is the new 23 . 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .. Be a good sport and play along ... 4 words is harder than you think 
I've got to go on a diet ? None of my jeans fit ... 
Bought a mini-fridge today cause the main fridge is not cooling right . Hope my apartments give me a new fridge or fixes it soon . 
Did my taxes . Bad news . Sure will miss my arm and my leg .
