pissed when people say all xboxs have cancer and will die and you should start digging a hole for it because it wont last more than a year and you will get an rrod and have to spend a million dollars to get it fixed and then it will break again and you should have bought a PS3 because its totally better and has good games when it isn't and dosen't because the are full of shit because 
the PS3 has the same problems as the xbox has and they can all go suck dicks !!!
