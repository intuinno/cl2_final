blub . I'm a fishy ! 
put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in caseyou didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy andpaste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . The other ... 7% ...... of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers 
will have my own vehicle soon ! WHEEEE !! 
sugarsugarsugar

Yes , this is going to be , by far , the oddest year of my life thus far . I am moving to a state I've only driven through once . I have four families to figure out for holidays instead of two . I need to figure out college and money and a wedding . I am confused , but ... oddly enough , not all that nervous . 
leftover stuffing and coffee for breakfast ... salad and an energy drink for lunch ... coffee and corn nuts for dinner . 
cold . tired . bed <3 
y'know I was excited to sleep in ... but apparently I now just wake up around eight anyway . I blame market basket . 
ramen soup . it is times like these that i need a spork . 
just got my paycheck ... therefore more Christmas shopping ! what do you want ? 
argh . coffee and attempting to get things done ? well ... at least coffee . 
I gave Smokey catnip ... he is now sitting in front of Devan's Christmas train and staring at it intently . I wonder what's going through his head ... 
< PROPFEMALE > comes home in twodaysish and I'm excited ^.^ 
meep ? 
YAY ! GIANT BOWL OF NOODLES ! <3 
EGGROLLS 
Coffee <3 
merrrr stress 
SQUEE ! ^.^ 
Can someone please explain to me why people become such huge jerks on holidays and weekends ? Seriously , I don't understand . 
how do i always manage to lose tape ? 
I'M EXCITED 
shower , laundry , errands , productivness 
I'm about 85% sure this cocoa should not be moving on its own . 
started cleaning ... got distracted by bubble wrap ... I'm not very good at this organization thing . 
going through the rest of my clothes and seeing what is donateable 
sushi ? sushi . SUSHI ! 
shrimp fried rice ... back to work in an hourish for inventory WOOHOO 
Happy <3 
eating , going to buy things for apartment , waiting for newman to get out of work 
i want a pet hedgehog . 
fell asleep at 7:00 this morning ... woke up about an hour ago .. still going to make today productive ? going to try . 
POTSTICKERS ! 
I dislike snow . 
eating chex mix with chopsticks . why ? partially because i feel like it and partially because it's fun to say . 
:( stupid boat 
my throat is starting to become angry 
ring pop and minecraft ^.^ 
I love my dad he just saw my brother watching scooby doo and proceeded to walk around the house talking like scooby ... 
hmmm this cold medicine is surprisingly not disgusting ... 
turns out refreshing the tracker doesn't make the package arrive faster ... 
coffee <3 
I feel like a lump . 
YAY ! i found my car ! it was the snow pile in the middle . 
\Chinese kid ! That means there's gonna be a monster\ " - Dev " 
bluuuuuuuh 
my hair hates me -_- 
going elsewhere . 
exhausted but not in the least bit sleepy >.> 
apparently not going to work until two 
It feel so much later than it is o.O 
hmmm ... looks like i will need to make some book purchases in the near future ... suggestions ? 
this loose tea holder thingy is so much fun to play with that i don't think i'll ever use it for its intended purpose .. 
waiting ... waiting ... waiting ... 
awesome because life loves me so much right now i can't reach my fiance for some reason when he's getting a plane ticket for me for the end of this week and i get to go to work and be treated like shit by people who apparently have never seen snow before . fuck everything . 
feeling a little better went from \if you look at me wrong i will command my secret demon-octopi minions to tentacle rape your soul\ " to simply worried " 
I think smokey things my big bag-o-peppermint tea is catnip . 
... how did i lose a pair of pants ? 
did i lose every eraser i own ? yes . yes i did .... dammit that means i need to draw this right the first time . 
head hurts from crying . 
if you want to help make me smile . occupy my brain with anything else . I can't do the \i'm sorry\ " s and the \ " how are you holding up\ " s anymore . " 
hmmm i should probably start packing . very glad I know awesome people and have an awesome family . 
in florida i still don't know when i'm leaving 
waiting for newman to get out of work 
60 and sunny .... so tempting to not go back at all <3 
Well you say your life's a bore , and i can't quite disagree\ 
If you judge your life by the pieces of shit that inhabit your T . V . \ 
Because they stand so proud , and they talk so loud\ 
and every other word is a lie i've found\ 
That everyone who is anyone is a waste of time 
My sailor just left .... time to kill 12 hours waiting for him to come back ... 
waitingwaitingwaitingwheeeee 
... back to new hampshire tonight 
delaying calling work to tell them i'm back until tomorrow so i can get stuff done . 
okay so ... i'm currently drinking chocolate tea ... and it's kind of really awesome 
it's nice to drive in circles 
it was really odd going into elm street today ... i felt so tall .. 
Flogging < PROPFEMALE > , chocolate tea , and Minecraft . Productivity can wait . 
mer 
Can't wait until all that chocolate goes on sale tomorrow . 
if i buy another pair of boots could someone please throw them at me ? 
BLEH okay going to tear myself away from facebook and be productive cleaning out my room at my moms so it's fit for human use . leaving my laptop here . yes . 
finally i get to stop lifting things for a minute . 
I want oreos so bad ... someone come over and bring me some ? 
oh gosh i found disks with photos from middle school ... 
\The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well 
EGGROLLS ! 
I have Newman and noodles today sucks less now 
looks like my cat decided while i was gone that my clean folded laundry was the comfiest spot in my house . jerk . 
my family is pretty awesome <3 
my hair is long enough for really < PROPFEMALE > pigtails ^.^ 
just 21 more days until no more market basket ! ^.^ 
looks like i'm not leaving until april ? 
never microwave ranch dressing and hot sauce it smells horrible ... chocolate-raspberry milk is kinda amazing though . 
i am going to live off noodles forever ^.^ 
i think my tea strainer thingy is confused , it doesn't seem to grasp the concept of keeping the tea leaves from getting out of it . 
I love my dad <3 
I sort of can use my desk again ! wheee ! that's enough productivity for today . 
I'm going to attempt to use as many of my < PROPMALE > supplies as possible before i leave next month . let's pretend it's to make some room in these boxes and not an excuse to buy more when i get to < PROPFEMALE > . =p 
I know the sun I'm looking at is the same sun seen by the world and that's a fact but i don't see things quite the same and some don't see the sun at all and that's a shame 
came home early from work because i feel like deep-fried poo . 
raspberries and pineapple <3 
so apparently my cat is terrified of plastic bags . 
4 days left of work ^.^ 
out of work early . 
grape jellybean + coffee jellybean = surprisingly good 
it's wicked nice out but if i go outside i will die a horrible sinus-y death . having the windows open should be okay . 
last day ^.^ 
my last day was a whole two hours =P 
Dear UPS , \ 
why is it going to take 3 days to get to New Hampshire from California but , it will take 4 days to get here from Ohio ? Your tracker exists solely to torment your customers . \ 
sincerely , < PROPFIRST > 
hmm .. every time i put down a pencil non my desk i lose it ... i guess i should clean my desk off again .... 
note to self : there is dye in your hair , stop trying to stick the pen behind your ear . 
note to self #2 : if you're going to buy a photo album , buy a good one . 
note to self #3 : moving things from your desk to your bed does not count as organizing it just gives you nowhere to sleep , it's a good thing you're not tired anyway . 
ramen <3 
note to self #4 : how do you not have a ruler ? seriously , wtf ? 
o < PROPMALE > extremely hot and overfilled bowl of ramen ... o < PROPMALE > stairs .... o < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > twirling between my legs ... o < PROPMALE > floor 
note to self #5 : you have an over active imagination that means watching old horror movies alone at 2:00 in the morning is a bad idea . 
\Remember the speech the prez made before Congress 
Can i be five years old again ? please ? 
Crazy < PROPMALE > people walking through my head\ 
One of them's got a beer\ 
He's yelling in my ear
