Okay so i haven't been on Facebook on my laptop for a while . And I have to say I do not like being deprived of the comment button . What happens when I want to start a new line in a comment ?

Sometimes we love someone so much we become numb to it . Because if we actually felt how much we love them , we would die from all of it . <3 -Riding in Cars With Boys
