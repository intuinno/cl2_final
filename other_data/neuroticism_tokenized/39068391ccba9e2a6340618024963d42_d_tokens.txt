has made $5.66 as a ChaCha guide 
wouldnt it be something if the cavs went winless from the end of the browns season to the start of the indians season ? heck theyre projected to win only two more games the rest of the season ... the 2 remaining against washington . 
RIP < PROPFEMALE > Edmison

I totally take back all the times I didn't want to nap when I was younger . 
Bye bye mo and < PROPFEMALE > . Hello baron < PROPMALE > . 
so put the 2 trades together ... the cavs got a better guard than mo in baron < PROPMALE > . a first round pick instead of a second rounder . and they pretty much traded < PROPFEMALE > for 2 rookies in the frontcourt for a small cavs team . so yeah i'd say the cavs did some work today . can't wait for the lottery ! 
the cavs have to learn how to play with heart every game . thats the only way theyre gonna win , and they've shown it against boston , the lakers and the knicks ( twice ) 
just can't wait for may 17th 
pretty sure i just made someones day . now its time to save 3 lives haha
