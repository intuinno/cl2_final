While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her . . Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence ! 
Going to a home show today with uncle < PROPMALE > and his family . Personally , it kinda sounds like I'm babysitting on an outing , but I'd like to get out of the house . :]

Getting the pool ready to swim in today . 
Hahahah ! < PROPFEMALE > looks like E.T right about now . We had to wrap an ace bandage around her head so she wouldn't bloody up her ear , and the only bandage we had was 6 in . long . It's better than her going insane , but she looks hilarious ! xD

Please put this as your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) that has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2011 is that people understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are very terrifying and nearly always unstoppable . 93% of people won't copy and past this . The other 7% sing in the shower . 
I have foreign songs stuck in my head . Anime music is becoming bittersweet for me . 
:O 
I'm not good at sewing by hand . D; 
Owww . My cat just mauled the shit outta me . Dx

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
GRARRR ! One week's already gone . 
Wow , It's already been 2 weeks . Clearfield , here I come ! 
things are well . There have been a few rough spots since i've been back , and things swerve off the path i have been wanting to take , but i think it's for the better . I certainly have been learning though ! I have to think things through .
