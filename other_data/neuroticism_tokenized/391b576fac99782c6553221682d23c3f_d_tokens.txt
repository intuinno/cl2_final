I I love God because He loved me first . I love God because He cares for me 24/24 and 7/7 without getting bored . I love God because even though I do many mistakes , He always forgives me . I love God because whenever I talk to Him , He is there . I love God because He loves me even though I mess up . 
Never let anyone steal the joy God has given you . If you have no joy , reflect on your blessings . Find your inner strengths and enjoy life . Stay positive and seek everyday to improve . Smile , love , live , laugh , meditate on the blessings of the Lord and talk to Them . Stop complaining about life . Someone Else's is worse . You can never get more if you don't appreciate what you already have :) 
I am not lucky . I am blessed <3

Lies are not accepted . No matter if is a little white lie or a dark evil lie . At the end of the day you will lose respect , hurt somebody , and the most important little detail you will lose the trust of those who love you and trusted you . Think wisely is it worth it to lie to somebody to \help\ " them ? or hurt them ? remember < PROPFEMALE > is a bitch and it bites hard ;) . "
