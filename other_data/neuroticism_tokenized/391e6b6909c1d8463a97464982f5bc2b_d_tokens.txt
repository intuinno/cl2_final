Wishing you all a happy , healthy and prosperous New Year ! 

Blessed Yule to one and all ! :-) 
I'm trying to figure out my Tracfone . Everybody , send me your phone < PROPFIRST > , and let's see if I can get them stored . 
It's SNOWING ! Well , at least I wasn't planning on driving anywhere . 
I will be so glad when winter is over . 
Well , I have a brand new baby cousin . < PROPMALE > Addizon Moroz . I haven't seen the pictures yet , but I here he's a cutie . :) 
Fucking kitchen drain pipes are frozen again . The washing machine backed up , and now I've got a river in my kitchen that smells like detergent . 
I think I'm addicted to Bejeweled . 
Last night , I dreamed I was hurling bombs through windows of corporate buildings . So much fun ! 
Man , I'm bored ! 
I'm really confused by the new Facebook format . This is their idea of \simplified ? \"" 
Happy < PROPMALE > Capone Day ! 
I get a video camera , and I lose the car . I get a tripod for the camera , and everyone's snowed in . If I get some video-editing software , I'm sure an asteroid would hit the earth . 
I got the National Anthem stuck in my head , and now I can't sit down . 
Tonight : < PROPMALE > & Urby's! Tomorrow Night : Bar ! 
Bar tonight . Come one , come all . 
Who all is going to the Last Comic Standing auditions in New York on the 21st ? I think a whole bunch of us should car pool . 
Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day ! 
I had a pretty good set at B&U's . Unfortunately , the crowd was a little too drunk to appreciate my complex style of humor . 
Well , the show at Bar was cancelled . Apparently , I'm the only comedian capable of not watching every minute of March Madness . 
Okay , I've been doing some research on Last Comic Standing . Apparently , if you're not there at least twelve hours before showtime , you'll be stuck at the back of the line and never get in before the auditions close . Also , there's a pre-audition screening , so have a less-than-one-minute set ready to dazzle the production assistants . 
Well , I just got back from my audition . None of the comics in our car pool got picked to be on the show . But I had fun . 
Comedy show at < PROPMALE > & Urby's this Wednesday . No , I'm not performing , but come out to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > Dudick , < PROPMALE > Hammond and Chuch Czaszar . 
Thursday Night @ Bar in Plains . Come on out ! 
Full < PROPFEMALE > tonight ! Too bad it's so cloudy . 
This rain is putting me to sleep . 
Just found out that M&T is closing its Plymouth branch in June . Apparently , somebody found out that I actually liked having a bank in walking distance . 
Hey , everybody . Stories of my death have been greatly exaggerated . Unfortunately , I no longer have my apartment , and I'm staying with Mom . I'm open to suggestions as to where to live next . 
I'm slowly getting used to being \homeless\ " and undead . But I still miss my recliner . " 
Ever get the feeling that life is a giant waiting room , and humanity is just reading old magazines until our name is called ? 
Addison is remodelling Mom's basement into a rec room , which will serve as a temporary lodging for me . 
I can't find my camera's battery charger . 
Just took the dogs on a nice \run . \"" 
Did I ever tell you about the time I went fishing off the coast of the Sandwich Islands , and caught a peanut-butter-and-jellyfish ? 
In case you missed it , here's what's going on . There was a big bang , some other shit happened , and now we're here . Now you're up to date . 
Have you ever seen a TV commercial which actually made you want to beat the shit out of the guy who wrote it ? 
Is anyone else getting error messages in their chat boxes ? 
Another day , another ... day . 
Comedy show at Judge & Jury tonight . I will not be attending , but < PROPFIRST > Keller will be taping it for television . 
My hair is currently the shortest it has been in my life . 
If all goes well , my new temporary room should be finished soon . 
The cartoon channels don't show enough episodes of < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > . 
NEW COMPUTER ! YAY ! 
My temporary home is complete , and it sure looks nice ! And I'm typing this on my brand new laptop . :-D 
I've got all my documents in my old computer . Now I just need to find a USB cable , so I can move them to my new computer . 
Watching Thumb Wars . :-D 
420 ! 
I'm finally getting all my files off my old computer . Yay , I actually have my comedy notes again ! 
All this hype about Earth Day ... Doesn't anybody give a shit about Mars ? 
What's going on with my hair ? It keeps puffing up on one side . 
Everybody wants to put a stop to something . Isn't anyone looking to start anything ? 
Is it my imagination , or are those advertizements for upcoming shows at the bottom of the screen getting bigger ? 
Knoebels opens today . That means lots of traffic around this area . Good think I'm not going anywhere . 
Cloudy drizzly days make me sleepy . |-/ 
Full < PROPFEMALE > ! Time to get out and howl ! 
Got some new DVDs today -- Clash of the Titans , and < PROPFIRST > and the Argonauts . The originals , obviously . Nothing beats < PROPFIRST > Harryhausen's special effects ! 
Yay ! I got my charger for my camera battery ! I can take video again ! 
< PROPFIRST > and the Argonauts is one of the most awesomest movies ever ! 
Wishing everyone a Happy Beltane . 
How do people eat soup ? You eat solids , and you drink liquids . Soup is a liquid , but people eat it . Does that make any sense at all ? 
I'm just going to fuck with the \most used words\ " application . Ding-dong pumpernickel tuba orangutan monkey-fucker goat urine antidisestablishmentarianism pepperoni pizza tofu supercalifragilisticexpialidocious mushroom cloud fahrvergnugen unilquadium circumcision cerabellum nutcracker spackle ring-a-ding-ding lalalalalala boing-boing-boing ...

I love the rain . It makes the plants grow . Grass is a plant . I cut the grass . On second thought , fuck the rain . 
Watching the Daily Show . 
Between walking dogs and mowing lawns , I'm spending a lot more time in the sun than I'm used to . I have found out that I freckle . 
This is the time of year , when at any given moment , you're hearing a lawnmower . 
You can catch more flies with bullshit , than you can with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Watching the rerun of the Comedy Central roast of Flava Flav . 
The Court Jester . As funny today as the first time I saw it . :-) 
I thought of an AWESOME new opening joke last night , and now I can't remember what it was . I really need to start bringing a pen in the shower with me . 
Why does Spring have to be such a tease ? It gives you some warm weather to get your hopes up , and then yanks it away . 
Why didn't anyone tell me there was an A-Team movie ??? 
Going to see Iron Man today . :-D 
Iron Man was awesome ! It didn't blow me away like the first one , but at the same time , it did not disappoint . I'm really looking forward to the Thor movie . 
Had the neighbor kids over watching Ghostbusters . Always awesome . \ 
\ 
Now watching The Crow . 
Has anyone else noticed that every time you turn on the History Channel , they're talking about either Hitler or Jesus . Every time you turn on the Science Channel , they're talking about black holes . And every time you turn on any other channel , they're showing Law & Order ? 
A rabbit came right to my door today , and sat there looking in . Good thing the dogs didn't see him . They'd have gone berzerk . 
If anyone is interested in stopping by Elysburg tmorrow during the yard sales , I'll be selling off a ton of my old books that I don't have room for . 
Well , I'm done with the yard sale . One guy bought my entire set of < PROPMALE > books and < PROPFEMALE > Trek reference guides , as well as my mother's < PROPMALE > Potter books . $4 . Later , someone else bought my copy of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s collective works . 25¢ . After that , nothing . So the rest I'm donating to the public library . 
Watching < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
HOLY SHIT !!! I just saw a MacDonald's commercial in which a mobster uses the line \sleepin ' with the filet-o-fishes ! \ " That's MY punch line ! : -0 " 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s a rerun , so I'm watching < PROPFIRST > Lopez . He's got Penn & Teller on . 
Philosophers look at the universe and ask why . Scientists look at the universe and ask how . I look at the universe and ask , what the fuck ?! 
I wonder if the lollypop guild ever had to go on strike . 
It's such a humid day . One of those days when you swim out to get the mail , drink your potato chips through a straw , work up a sweat by thinking too hard , and have more water outside the glass than inside . 
Just sitting at home , chilling with the dogs and cat , and watching Youtube videos . 
There are two kinds of people in the world . People who fit into one of those two categories . And people who don't . 
Does anyone find it odd that there are so many TV channels that broadcast music , and yet instead of showing music videos , they show a blank screen or a still photo of the band ? They do know it's television , and not radio , right ? 
The dog stole my soupies . I didn't even get to have any . :-( 
Okay , explain this to me . Cloudy , rainy days make people sleepy -- especially me . So then why does nighttime not make me twice as sleepy ? 
Last Comic Standing on NBC tonight at 8:00 - 10:00 . Look for me in the New York crowd outside ! 
This is one of those hot , humid days , when everyone has a perm , whether you want one or not . 
You ever wonder it the bacteria living in your intestines worship you as a god ? 
Last Comic Standing's Facebook < PROPFEMALE > kicked me off , and deleted my comment and the previous person's comment . Apparently , we're not supposed to question how awesome it is to follow celebrities on Twitter . 
Happy Summer Solstice !!! :-D 
Well , I got my head shrunk today . Going back next month to look at the pretty ink blots . 
Going to get my eyes checked today . I'm looking forward to finally getting new glasses . :-) 
Predators ?! Holy shit , must see ! 
Shit shit shit ... I just lost a text document will all the new jokes I was working on . Now I can only remember a few of them . :-( 
How much longer must I wait for the air-conditioner guy ? 
Just spent the day at Knoebels . Amazing how much the park has changed since I was there last . 
Bored ..... 
Moving props today , getting ready for the play . 
Internet's running a little sluggish today . Must be this heat making the serves drowsy . 
Hot -- Waiting on air-conditiner guy . \ 
Buggy -- Waiting on exterminator . \ 
Blind -- Waiting on new glasses . \ 
Crazy -- Waiting on shrink . \ 
Bored -- Waiting on next adventure . \ 
Could somebody at least give me a magazine or pierce my ears while I wait ? 
Yay ! My new eyeglasses are here ! I CAN SEE !!! 8-0\ 
I just ordered my perscription sunglasses from Zenni . 
And the exterminator is here ! So no more bugs ! :-) 
Air-conditioner guy is coming tomorrow ! Yay ! :-D 
WE HAVE AIR CONDITIONING ! :-D 
I'd like to know whose idea it was to promote movies in Facebook ads , by having people \vote\ " on what they guess the plot is . How the fuck would I know what Cobb's mission in \ " Inception\ " is ? The movie isn't out yet ! Or is it just assumed that we're supposed to all have seen an early bootleg by now ? " 
Today was a really good day . Not too hot , not too cold . I almost forgot what a good day felt like . :-) 
Did you see the commercial where all the Founding Fathers are drinking < PROPMALE > Light ? Look closely . Does anyone notice that < PROPFIRST > Adams was absent from the party ? I guess it would have looked silly to have < PROPFIRST > Adams drinking < PROPMALE > Lite . 
Watching 1776 . :-) 
It's so hot today , I saw chicken lay a hard-boiled egg . 
Do you realize that every time you listen to Mozart or Beethoven , you're basically listening to a cover band ? 
It's a new < PROPFEMALE > tonight . I wonder what we're going to do with our old one . 
Have you seen the rerun of the < PROPFEMALE > Wars episode of Family Guy on Adult Swim ? There was one joke that cracked me up the first time , when the two guys were standing on the ledge saying they wanted a rail . But now it seems to have been cut out of the episode . What the fuck ? 
Yay , my new perscription sunglasses have arrived ! And the don't even look like perscription glasses . They just look like regular sunglasses . So not only do I look awesome , but I can see when I'm outside in the daytime . :-) 
You can be Will , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , but not < PROPMALE > iam . \ 
You can be < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , but not Dichard . \ 
You can be < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > athan , but not < PROPFIRST > athan . \ 
You can be < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > ward , but not < PROPMALE > ward or < PROPMALE > ward . \ 
Weird . 
The purpose of almost every consumer product is to fulfill a < PROPFEMALE > . That's why porn is weird . It's a product specifically designed to create a < PROPFEMALE > , and not fulfill it . It would be like if the food industry stopped selling food , and instead , sold you a pill that would make you very hungry . 
Did you see the commercial for the Varsity Snuggy , where they're all dressed alike ? Just what I was thinking , college students should look more like a brotherhood of Dominican monks ! 
< PROPMALE > Chaney LITERALLY has no pulse ! Holy shit ! 
I think it's ironic that so many people misuse the word \ironic . \ " \ 
Had fish today at the Knoebels ' Fish Fry . Generally , I'm not a big fan of fish , but this was pretty good . :-) 
It's only two and a half months to Halloween . I wonder if I should start working on a costume . 
I have never understood the color purple . I mean , how is it that a low-frequency color ( red ) mixes with a high frequency color ( blue ) and comes up with an even HIGHER frequency color ( purple) ? By that reasoning , shouldn't purple be in the rainbow halfway between red and blue ? 
I'm going through my old Transformers . Man , I don't know who half of these guys even are . And most of my time is spent trying to match up missing parts . 
I might be going to Pittsburgh in a few weeks to see Phantom of the Opera . There's also some sort of three-day Phantom convention . ( I'll get more details soon . )\ 
Is anyone else interested in going ? More people means less cost per person . 
Blah . 
More information on the Phantom trip to Pittsburgh : 
Spamalot is playing in Scranton in April . Anyone interested in going with me ? ( I know it's early , but if I wait too long , the good seats will be gone , and no one will be able to get off work , and then after it's over , I'll hear from all the people who wanted to go , but didn't check their Facebooks for the last couple of weeks , etc . ) 
... 
Heh , I don't know what time it is . My VCR clock is set to turn back automatically . No one told it we don't turn the clocks back until next week . :-p 
Come join me ! - I started a LIVE video chat at http://apps.facebook.com/tinychat/100001597420648 
Hey , I just got on Skype . Still figuring it out . 
Yay , I got ALL my Between-You-And-Me questions unlocked ! :-D 
What's up with Twitter . I haven't been able to read tweets all day . :-/ 
There's a movie about aliens fighting cowboys , and there's a movie about cowboys fighting ninjas . I'm making a prediction here . The next one will be ninjas fighting pirates . And I predict it would be fucking awesome . 
I just re-posted a whole bunch of pics from my Myspace < PROPFEMALE > to my Facebook . 
Okay , people , enough with the old cartoons in the profile pics . I can't tell who's online anymore . ( Yeah , I know , it's supposed to raise awareness for some shit or another . It doesn't work if you have to EXPLAIN to people what you're raising awareness for . ) 
You know , I'm realizing how important Christmas lights are . Winter is so depressingly gray and dark , we need a tree throwing a full spectrum at us , just to keep us sane . 
Got lots of awesome DVDs this year ! Neverending Story , < PROPMALE > Python's Life of < PROPFIRST > , The < PROPFEMALE > ( < PROPMALE > Price version ) , Transformers the Movie ( 1985 version ) , The < PROPFEMALE > Bride , < PROPFIRST > Pratchett's The Color of Magic , and the Universal Classic Horror Collections ( Wolfman , Invisible Man , Creature from the Black Lagood , Frankenstein ) . 
I learned how to tag people like < PROPFEMALE > Foley in my status updates . :-) 
I said ten years ago that the Zodiac calander was off by a month . Nobody took me seriously , so I let it go . A year or so ago , I got a Libra tattoo . Now the astronomers are announcing that yes , the calander is off by one month , and everyone who is a Libra is really a Virgo . Fuck , what am I supposed to do now ? Change my tattoo ? And also become less flighty , and more down-to-earth ?
