If you ever get a < PROPMALE > watch \National Geographic : Moment of Death\ " . It could very possibly change the way you view your existence and significance . I suggest you watch it in a well lit area when its still day time . I also advise you watch something hilariously funny afterward so you don't sit in your dimly lit room at nine o'clock at night and freak out like im doing right now . " 
Ahhhhh ..... There's nothin like bringing home a new monitor , hooking it up , and firing up WoW for the first time .... 
Dear Microsoft Vista , May you burn for all eternity because you are the worst operating system ever made .
