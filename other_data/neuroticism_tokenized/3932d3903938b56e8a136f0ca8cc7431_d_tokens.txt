Whats on my mind .?. Whats on my mind .?. Whats on my mind .?. Stop badgering me !!! 
I learned a little yoga , and swam into the sky . I mined the < PROPFEMALE > for peanut oil , and never reasoned why . Some day I think I'll settle down and be a kangaroo , and search the corners of my mind for other things to do . 
Gigity ! 
Bipity bopity blah ... 
Making < PROPMALE > making < PROPMALE > making < PROPMALE > woot woot ! 
The voices in my head keep me awake jabbering in some language I don't understand , like Chinees or Canadian .?.
