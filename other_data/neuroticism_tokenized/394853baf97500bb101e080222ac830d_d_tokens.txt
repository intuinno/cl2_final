needs something extraordinary tonight . 

It's a surprise you haven't caught on yet , It's nothing personal- you're an embarassment . 
\The Politics of ecstasy are real Can't you feel them working thru you Turning night into day Mixing sun with the sea\ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Morrison " 
How long until the tables turn ? When will we ever , will we ever get what we deserve ? 
parties for her right to fight . 
is tired of summer classes . whats up , exam ? I'd rather be wasting my time on social networking sites , staying out too late with the crew & gettin ' jiggy with my < PROPMALE > . 
is seeing < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > tonight with Hamballin ' . She kissed a girl & liked it , then she woke up in Vegas or something so I'm glad an artist that appeals to young kids warns the youth about the dangers of drug use ? 
can't imagine life without text messaging . Its an addiction , I can't wait to see it on \Intervention \"." 
likes to Twitter . Okay , there- the truth is out . Yes , I realize I'm ranking high on the LAME scale but I guess I should be a stalker when I grow up cause I love knowing what other people are doing .. constantly . 
loves balloons . upgrade : balloon animals . 
is making dreams , breaking scenes & shaking things up . 
is 8,674 . 3421% sure that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is her exact counterpart . You kids better be ready to purchase my novel . 
tried this trick to spin it . her head collapsed but there's nothing in it . And she'll ask herself , \where is my mind \"?" 
That's the danger in starting a fire , you'll never know how many bridges you'll burn . 
I'm keeping an eye on the future , an eye on the past & the present in my pocket just in case I need a door . 
left her cellular device at < PROPFIRST>'s house & feels rather incomplete . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , call me on the tin can phone . 
We can pull a map out detailing the direct route . Young ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the fray . If we don't wake up and the truth never comes up- You will never have our old < PROPFIRST > , you will never have a right of way . 
My adoptive Hispanic family hooked it up in my Easter baskets ! I'm not tired of eating < PROPFEMALE > yet , I'm tired of reminding myself I'll be at the gym tomorrow . Whats up , butterfinger ? 
I guess it goes full circle like a cheerio- Cause you're rockin ' what I was rockin ' like a year ago ! 
Watching live ducklings splash around in my bath tub = the cutest thing I've ever seen . Oh boy , they sure do love tomatoes ! 
Since when do strangers at the gym not enjoy positive affirmations ? Apparently , \you go girl ! High five ! \ " means roll your eyes & walk away . " 
Whatchu know bout < PROPFIRST > 5000 Watts ?! If Heavy wasn't performing , you would not see me at Bikini Beach . I'm making an exception . 
Social Life < Artistic Expression . 2x + Dubstep night < $20/ 4.225 = $4.734 . < PROPFIRST > > showering -7x . comfort > pants . I think that was the new compound inequality demonstration of my current state . 
I love my duckies . They are the only being that can shart frequently & still be so cute . I find duck feet hilarious , this is also a factor . 
I translate my investments with hustlenomics . Over $100 spent at the vet so Quackie < PROPFEMALE > could get some sizzurp . Prognosis : permanently sittin ' sideways . 
Two thoughts : I'm extremely grateful for the education I received through CCISD . I feel incredibly rude when wearing flip-fops in a library . 
Wake up in the morning smelling like Beyonce . I bet you read that in your head to the tune of a Ke$ha song . 
Since I also enjoy getting money , as well as staying true , I'm stoked to meet < PROPFIRST > Wall today :D 
Maybe the reasoning behind my avoidance of checking my voicemails is related to the fact that I can't leave a decent voicemail . 
Tonight I was the < PROPFEMALE > Prom < PROPFEMALE > . But < PROPFIRST > had three boyfriends , two dresses & plenty of coin . Whos the real winner ? 
FML . I have two baby ducks at home , I can't afford a ticket . I hope you made your quota , Officer Speedtrap . You didnt protect or serve me ! 
\now I have 4 rotton bananas in the ice box & I can't get my hair to stop smelling like bananas . Yes ! We all feel like dishrags . \"- WISE . " 
YES . Alexisonfire on Monday ! I'm so thrilled , I may pee . < PROPFIRST > Green is the verbal interpretation of my every inner thought . 
Anyone interested in tickets to < PROPFIRST > Morrison tomorrow night ? My friend has two , $20 each . If not , I will attend instead . Its whatever . haha 
Hollering at Super Happy Fun Land to see Somosuno & Blackie . It feels like summer now since I have a backpack of beer instead of books . 
:D yoga then tanning at a beautiful pool looking over Clear Lake with the bestfriend . Maybe I've reached the P-diddy morning state of mind . 
Y por eso los grandes amores de muchos colores , me gustan mi . Cool , another spanish song stuck in my head . Now I have to be annoying . 
Best advice all day : \if that fails just say fuck it & get corn rows\ " . I want to hit Drinco de Mayo tonight ! study study study study study . " 
I turned off my Twitter text alerts last week & realized something was missing in my life since I didnt know what @HollyValentine was up to . 
my cell phone is deceased . Or atleast in a serious coma . I feel so alone without random texts , twitter alerts , & annoying phone calls . 
I just applied to be on the Real World . Who wants to help me make a video ? I realized around three a.m. last night that perhaps reality television is my true calling . 
HAPPY 21st BIRTHDAY , < PROPFIRST > TOMAN ! :D tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time . 
Tyger ! Tyger ! burning bright In the forests of the night , What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry ? 
I wish I was awkward looking & skinny enough to be a Urban Outfitter's model . Not because thats attractive , but because I want all of their clothes . For free . Seriously . 
YES ! Not only did I just have an awesome dinner & dessert- but guess who got a leopard print snuggie for her birthday ?! Yeah , ME . This is a gift that keeps on givin ' . 
I ate an entire cantaloupe today . This is a true story . 
the assignment : develop a non-literal interpretation of a certain song , likely non-objective . Medium : acrylic paint , Musical Artist : Daft Punk , Song ? I can't decide . 
I love ridiculous Snuggie commercials , the things Kanye West says , and the fact that I ate 5 Popsicles today . My life is so deep . 
How strange , the golfers on the course at San Jac don't enjoy dubstep as much as I do . Did you just give me the finger over some wub wub wub dubs ?
