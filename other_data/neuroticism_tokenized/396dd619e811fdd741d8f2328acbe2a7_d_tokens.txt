I might not be the most beautiful , or the sexiest .. nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be first choice , but I'm a GREAT choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm too good at being ME . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past , but I'm proud of who I am today ! Take me as I am ... or watch me as I walk away . Re-Post this if you love being you !!! 
“Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind . ” ~ Dr. Seuss ~ 
Never explain . Your friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe it anyway . ~ Elbert Hubbard , A Thousand and One Epigrams , 1911 
Never\ 
make your home in a place . Make a home for yourself inside your own \ 
head . You'll find what you need to furnish it - memory , friends you can\ 
trust , love of learning , and other such things . That way it will go \ 
with you wherever you journey . ~ Tad < PROPMALE > 
“Your time is limited , don’t waste it living someone else’s life . Don’t \ 
be trapped by dogma , which is living the result of other people’s \ 
thinking . Don’t let the noise of other’s opinion drowned your own inner \ 
voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and \ 
intuition , they somehow already know what you truly want to become . \ 
Everything else is secondary . ” – < PROPMALE > Jobs 
I finally have that huge weight lifted off my shoulders ! 
Drove thru a huge Redwood tree today ... well barely thru it giggles ... how awesome was it ?! EPIC ^.^ 
A wise friend told me \trust is like a mirror . when you break it you can put it back together and rebuild it 
The ability to convert ideas to things is the secret to outward success !

“Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it . ” ( Dalai Lama ) 
While taking the COMPASS test yesterday , I was reminded one person taking the time to make a difference in someone else's life could potentially create a domino effect of people helping others . So pass on the good stuff ! 
If\ 
you have a dog who has made you laugh , brightened your life , silently \ 
accepted your tears without judgement , snuggled with you , forgiven your \ 
faults and loved you anyway , make this your status . Dogs are a gift most\ 
of us don't deserve . 
Learn from yesterday , live for today , hope for tomorrow . 
In what you say of another , apply the test of kindness , necessity and truth , and let nothing pass your lips without a 2/3 majority .

-The secret of many a man's success in the world resides in his insight into the moods of men and his tact in dealing with them . \ 
J . G . Holland 
Family quarrels have a total bitterness unmatched by others . Yet it sometimes happens that they also have a kind of tang , a pleasantness beneath the unpleasantness , based on the tacit understanding that this is not for keeps ; that any limb you climb out on will still be there later for you to climb back . ~ Mignon McLaughlin , The Neurotic's Notebook , 1960 
say \googled it\ " five times fast giggles ... ^.^ " 
You've got to take the good with the bad , smile with the sad , love what you've got , and remember what you had . Always forgive , but never forget . Learn from mistakes , but never regret . 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone ! 
Every passing face on the street represents a story every bit as compelling and complicated as yours . 
It is difficult to say what is impossible , for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and reality of tomorrow ! 
Nearly all spiritual practices are based on attention . In fact , whenever you think you have lost the path , or whenever you feel confused by esoteric terminology or technique , remember that all these techniques or teachings are various ways to help you learn to pay attention . \

What we feel , think , and do this moment influences both our present and the future in way we may never know . Begin . Start right where you are . Consider your possibilities and find inspiration .. to add more meaning and zest to your life . ~ Alexandra Stoddard

Graduation is only a concept . In real life every day you graduate . Graduation is a process that goes on until the last day of your life . If you can grasp that , you'll make a difference .

Each story of our past is a puzzle piece to who we are today . As we evaluate our lives and continue to put it together , we come across pieces that remind us of both good times that take us back and bring new aspects to our futures that we once may have lost , as well as find the pieces that are frayed around the edges . No matter which piece you may find in yours , may it remind you of why you are where you are today . 
Bleh .. formaldehyde .. stinks .. makes your eyes water too .. gross stuff . 
I would like all my facebook friends to comment on this status sharing how you met me . But I want you to LIE ... That's right , just make it up . After you comment copy this status so I can do the same . I wonder who will actually read the instructions .
