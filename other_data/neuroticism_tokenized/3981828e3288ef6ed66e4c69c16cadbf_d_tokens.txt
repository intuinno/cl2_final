My family ... just ... wow .

One of these things just doesn't belong here , and I'm thinking it's the law enforcement truck going 80 mph that just passed me . 
DCI ! Everybody lay on the field ! 
BASES ARE NOT ACIDIC . 
B lunch , three years running ! 
decided that summer was officially over once school started . < PROPFEMALE > also concluded that you only need sunscreen in the summer . < PROPFEMALE > is not very smart . 
< PROPFEMALE > McLachlan just doesn't seem to fit the atmosphere of < PROPFIRST > Osco . I mean , \In the Arms of an Angel\ " was a rather odd soundtrack to picking out my frozen pizza . " 
g ? q 
kinda beasted the ladder work . Yaaaa- Wait , no more ladder work ? Awesome . ): 
No band today . NAAAAAAAAP . :D 
My neighbors either need to turn down their music or start inviting me to their parties . 
thinks it's hilarious that the school's sprinkler system is running at full force right now . 
Making spaghetti ! No , YOU should be sleeping . Don't judge me . 
Mom : \Don't drink from the water bottle in the car . \ " \ 
Just slept for four hours and is ready to go back to bed . 
School . Ugh . 
Already sick . This does not bode well . 
I really thought earrings were supposed to come in pairs . You'd never know it to look at my collection . 
feels bleh . Apparently , so does everyone else and their mothers . 
Dear Immune System , I have been taking my vitamins . What more do you want from me ?! Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Even my dog is a social reject . 
Mrs. Monhardt has informed me that my \A\ " stands for \ " Adultery . \ " lolololol " 
is very confused and is strangely okay with that . 
needs to stop leaving her stuff all over BHS . 
So , The Event didn't name their first episode Pilot ! Are they allowed to do that ? 
Hahahaaa ... Congratulations Marching Raiders - you participated ! \ 
And now I shall sleep in my cozy bed . <3 
How I dress on nerd day is eerily similar to how I dress every day of my life . 
Why are there no band-aids in this house ? Or sandwich ingredients ? These are both essential to my daily life . 
It didn't rain at the homecoming game ! 
My dog needs to stop trying to befriend skunks . This is ridiculous . 
Just fell asleep and burnt my arm on my laptop . I am friggin special . 
hopes that generic brand , low sodium chicken noodle soup does not tastes as bad as it sounds/smells . 
kinda wishes she had her violin . Well , that's a new one . 
\Flight of stairs\ " is such a weird phrase ! I like it . " 
Mystery solved : Scuba = Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus . \ 
That will be all . 
Go Marching Raiders ! Lets win a podium !!! 
Screw podiums , first place in 4A is a lot more fun . 
Two things :\ 
1 . Just went on an amazing extemporaneous Steak ' n ' Shake run . \ 
2 . Just used the word \extemporaneous . \"" 
is gonna miss the class of 2011 , fo sho . <3 
wishes she had a better shor t-t erm memory . And a better shor t-t erm memory would be nice , too . 
What a season ! (: 
Fear not , the BHS administration will protect us from poetry ! 
is a filthy liar . But hey , whatcha gon do ? 
waves before she hangs up the phone . 
I hate stomach aches . Apparently , they hate me , too . 
Ended up at an < PROPMALE > showing in Downtown Bloomington with Mrs. Monhardt . My life is so random . 
brings you the most ambiguous song lyric status ever :\ 
Na na na na na na na na ! 
Why do dentists always ask you questions when their hands are in your mouth ? \ 
\So 
Hey ! The play was great . Go see it (: 
When I fail , I fail spectacularly . 
Emergency wisdom tooth removal , go ! 
Mah mouf ish reary numb . 
Turned in my Huck Finn paper . It is now officially the weekend . 
Finally got out to see < PROPMALE > Potter . AHHH <3 <3 <3 
Death to bowties . 
wishes AutoCorrect would stop changing \its\ " to \ " it's . \ " \ 
There's always furniture where I'm trying to walk . 
I LOVE DRIVING IN THE SNOW . ( Cause I'm crazy and all . ) 
I lost my phone charger again . /: \ 
So , if I don't answer your call/text , it's probably not because I hate you but because my phone is dead . 
Lol , my life . 
It is really cold . I am not a fan . 
Band/Orchestra concert tonight ! \ 
Be there or be square . ( : 
Wooow . Someone stole our recycle bins . Really now ? 
can't believe we actually have school today ... ugh . 
What I learned in orchestra today : Nothing says Christmas like small children , helicopters , a < PROPFEMALE > of < PROPFIRST > , and a kitten . Especially the kitten . 
just took a nap on bus 26 . 
Finals week makes me feel very ( < PROPFIRST > Biden ) . 
Well , I've gotten my annual Christmas Cold . I was starting to think it wasn't going to make it this year . 
I think I need to go to emoticon rehab . (: 
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely . 
Not getting my license today . Waaay to lose my Social Security card , Mom . 
My long-standing fear of my E string snapping in my face is totally justified . I proved it . 
My parents ' argument for why I can't do the Musical is that I'm doing well now . Apparently , this must be due to the fact that I'm not involved in any musicals ? 
is street legal , baby . 
So , I woke up ten minutes ago and started freaking out because school started half an hour ago . Yeah . 
< PROPFEMALE > Purcell's life is a Lifetime movie . 
\Why isn't your thumb called first finger when you play violin ? \ " -My mom " 
I'm gonna get a blizzard for my half birthday ! 
So ... they're calling in the National Guard ? 
Yeah , I should probably start my homework now . 
Asdfjkljvwqnvepickles . < PROPFEMALE > Dungan . 
is traveling at the speed of light while dividing by zero . 
Today is such a sleepy day . 
Orchestra concert time ! This is gonna be something else . (<-- Purposely vague and ambiguous . ) 
Just realized I didn't turn in my Practice SAT form . I'm rather annoyed but not all that surprised . 
Is it actually snowing again or am I having cold medicine hallucinations ? 
I am officially the old lady with Kleenex in her purse . 
Just saw Hairspray last night and it was AMAZING . The cast , crew , and pit were all fabulous ! If you haven't seen the musical yet , you should go today :D 
I just decided my paper sucks . So I'm going to write a new one ! Right now . Why do I always do this to myself ? 
Going on a college visit ? I don't wanna grow up . 
\I'm totally wasted . I should drive around town in a pick-up with a ladder in the back ! \ " \
