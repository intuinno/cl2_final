Why the hell are all these things supposed to be so important ? Is graduating really supposed to make me ( or anyone ) happy in the long run ? Sure , maybe they’ll have better job opportunities , but does that really make them happy ? I’m sorry I don’t find all this bullshit to be a priority . I’m even sorrier you lived your whole life trying to make something of yourself , thinking you’d find happiness through achievement and status ; and never found it .

REALLY ? My dad is upset about the progress report I printed out for him because I haven’t logged in to my Geometry , Creative Writing , and Photography classes in 5 or 6 days . It’s a brand new program , and he doesn’t even know what the fuck he’s looking at . Guess what , asshole ? That’s becase I’m AHEAD in those classes , and I was focusing on the other 3 that I wasn’t ahead in . Way to be an asshat , dad 
If I'm not mistaken , at the end of this school year I only need 0.5 PE/Health credits , 0.5 Social Studies credits , and 1.5 elective credits :3
