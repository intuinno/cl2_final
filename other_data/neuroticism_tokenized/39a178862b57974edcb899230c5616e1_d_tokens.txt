Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes - I know I am 3 weeks late ... I haven't been on Facebook all month - it has been a crazy month 

Never leaving the house is making this snow and cold weather a lot more tolerable . 
Happy Holidays ! 
Still at home watching baaaaad TV . Who knew there is a show called DEA about drug busts in NJ ? and I would be lucky enough to find an all day marathon ? :) 
Go SU !
