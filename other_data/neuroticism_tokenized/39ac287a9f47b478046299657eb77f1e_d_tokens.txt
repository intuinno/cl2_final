Almost 4 a.m. Not a bad time to be home , right ? 

\If you wanna get with me there's some things you've got to know . I like my beats fast and my bass down low . \"" 
My mom is not making it easy for me to start eating healthier this year . I just woke up to fresh from the oven cinnamon rolls :/ 
Got life almost figured out :) 
\Mmmmm donut . \ " :D Thanks daddy . Best text message ever . " 
< PROPFIRST>'s today . Should be cool . :) 
Learning the ins and outs of a home run business can get complicated :/ Somewhat exciting to learn new things though . Have to do it at some point before daddy is stuck in the hospital . * sigh * 
Just when you think someone's actually your friend :/ Ah well . Life goes on . 
Being alone freakin sucks . Haha . Daddy I miss you :( 
< PROPMALE > out with the Crawford family today . Had some fun . Still miss daddy . 
It has been a LONG 3 or 4 days . :/ 
Mamma's cookin ' dinner tonight . Should help relieve some stress . Had a bit of a scare at the hospital today . To anyone who cares , pray for my daddy . I really would love to talk to him again . I could use one of his big bear hugs . 
Just got a fun message . \ur cute r u single ? im 17 what about u ? \ " Oh the bluntness of people these days . " 
I can't even begin to understand how I'm supposed to deal with this . . . 
Was thinkin about goin ' to < PROPFEMALE > for a few hours today . Could've been fun . Damn winds . Sounded so relaxing and distracting . :/ 
I start school in TWO days . Oh goodness . Nerves nerves nerves . Plus excitement :) 
Today's the day . :) 
I think I like school again :) 
I have homework for a class I haven't even attended yet . :/ 
I really wish my dog wouldn't pleasure himself in front of me ... Gross . Time to go outside < PROPMALE > . haha 
I'm sick of it . Of all of it . I don't need other people's bullshit finding it's way into my life right now . I've got quite enough on my plate . Trying to do homework in this environment is useless . Too much on my mind . Goodnight all . Gonna sleep it off . 
A two and a half hour break between classes ... Boredom . 
I miss him so much ... 
Been a long day . I love you sis . <3 
Had dinner with the sis . Now waiting for Philosophy : Language , Mind , and Reality to begin . Just forty more minutes . Not so bad . Music and laptop helps :) 
Boys <3 College is wonderful :) hahahaha 
Only one class tomorrow . A meeting with a photographer . And the rest of the day to do WHATEVER I please . Should be a good day :) I hope . 
Thunder ! <3 
This weather is getting a little ridiculous . I go inside and it's < PROPFEMALE > and like 85 degrees , then 20 minutes later , I glance out and the entire campus is ducking for cover because it's pouring rain . Now I just got out of class and it's hot and bright again . Stupid . haha 
Wow . Quite a month . Quite . A . Month . I went home tonight to walk into a burglary . Someone was in my fucking house . Really ? What else you going to throw at me ? 
Lovin ' this weather . My laptop on the other hand , is not so happy with random downpours of rain . 
I like it on the floor <3 
Yeah . It's kind of pointless . 
School ... eh . Glad the weeks almost over . Love the people though . I very much enjoy approaching strangers and starting a conversation :) 
Waiting to begin Philosophy : Language , Mind , and Reality discussion . My brain already hurts :/ gah 
Got an offer from a photographer . Offered to fly me out to Alaska and put me in a hotel for a night to do a shoot with him . All from his wallet . Tempting ... but no . I cannot :/ School and personal safety first ! Although I would like to visit Alaska . 
Happy birthday daddy <3 
Missin ' him ... 
Just got home from school . Think my ipod's broken :/ Ah well not the end of the world . Pizza for dinner . Mom's tryin ' to fatten me up . 
More symmetry in faces suggests more copulatory orgasms ?... Strange class . Am I going to be tested on this ? haha 
Don't want to go to class ... don't want to go to class ... don't want to go to class ... Crap . I have to go to class . :/ 
I want a new car . I'm thinkin ... Hyundai Sonata . Yep . :) It's going to be mine . 
What can I say ? I like the dorky kids :) 
Had a test today , have a test on Monday , have a test on Tuesday . Could we maybe space these out a little more people ? 
Getting sick :/ 
Got a halloween costume . It's pink . Gasp ! Party tonight , don't know if I'll go . 
Mom and her boyfriend ... cuddling . Sister and her girlfriend ... cuddling . Me and my ... laptop ? Pathetic . haha 
Psych 002 exam ... check . Philosophy 010 midterm ... check . Psych 049 test ... tomorrow . :/ 
Feelin ' like caca . Cat's following me around . I'm sneezy . :/ 
Left class early . Not feelin ' so great . 
Shopping is wonderful therapy . <3 
Got a new cell number . If I haven't already sent you a message with it and you want it , send me a message , either to my phone or here on Facebook , and I'll give it to you . :) 
\Party and party and party and par and par and party and party ... \ " That's been stuck in my head all day . What the hell is that ? haha " 
Philosophy ... Actually ... Made sense today ! :D 
Anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > out ? I'm tired of being home on Friday nights . haha 
I'd love it if people could actually spell ... 
Back from the dirty show . Pretty fun . Comedians are ... well ... funny . haha 
There are at least 30 flies surrounding me right now ... I hate bugs . 
It's after midnight and my cat is stalking me . Every time I sit down , he's on me , bein ' all cute and cuddly . When I leave , he chases me down . I'm just trying to get ready for bed ! 
I don't like this shift in weather . I much prefer the cold and rainy days . I miss them already <3 
I share the birthday of April 9th with < PROPFEMALE > Jameson and < PROPMALE > Hefner ... Couldn't I have better people to share that with ? haha OH ! There's < PROPFEMALE > Porizkova too :) That's a little better . 
Hangin ' out with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Crawford at Cal Poly Pomona <3 
Why do so many people insist I look like < PROPFIRST > Diaz ? haha . I don't get it . 3 or 4 times this week alone ! 
Excuse me , I'm sorry , I'm really such such a lady <3 
I'm as cold as the cold wind , blows when it snows and it's twenty below <3 
Thanks < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ;) hahaha got it ! 
It bothers me a little bit that there are 10 year olds more talented and successful out there than I am . haha I whip my hair back and forth ! 
Jingle bells\ 
my shit smells\ 
and I am fucking fake ! \ 
\ 
All along\ 
I knew better\ 
and that was my first mistake ... \ 
Ahhhh . Mindless Self Indulgence . I love you crazy people . haha <3 
No school tomorrow !!! :D 
It has been ... a pretty damn good week . :D Things appear to be turning around in a positive way . 
I like to read up on the traits of my sign and Chinese year . Aries and the year of the monkey . It usually seems surprisingly accurate :) 
My room is FINALLY almost clean ! Thank you < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > for helping ... Sorta . haha 
Did a lot of driving today . A bit tired . Scratched the back of my neck pretty hard . Made it bleed :/ Damn nails . Gonna clean some more . Start on my psych essay too . Bein ' all productive and what not . 
\That phone is sooo annoying\ " hahahaha " 
Got up at 5:30 to go to the gym because my friends < PROPFEMALE > Fogerty and < PROPFEMALE > Nitahara wanted me to . Who CHOOSES to be up that early ? haha . Ah well , I'm tired but I'm glad I did it . Feels good . :) 
... Good day :) 
... Hell why not ? I feel like saying nice things . Like my status , I say one thing that I like about you and blah blah blah . :) 
Good workout this morning . Props to < PROPFEMALE > Fogerty for bein ' stronger than I thought . Keep it up ' cuz it just keeps me motivated ! :) 
Have to be in court tomorrow by 8:30 a . m to testify against the guy who robbed my house . Bleeeh . Guess it's time to get to bed then huh ? 
It's Friday night . Let's go out ! <3 
Kinda want to go to club Sevilla . Anyone ? 
Riverside is the third worst place in the country for finding a job ... Great . 
Movies tomorrow with < PROPFEMALE > Hook after my early morning gym visit :) 
It sincerely irritates me to great extents when people , who are well aware they need to make a certain turn soon , be it left or right , stay in the comple OPPOSITE < PROPFIRST > until the last possible second , then cut everyone off because the're too stupid or self-involved to stay in the more convenient and sensible < PROPFIRST > . 
Got my winter quarter classes set up . aaaaannndd .... they suck . :/ I hate being a freshman all over again . haha 
Aced a Philosophy midterm . <3 Excited :D 
Change your FB Profile Picture to a Cartoon from your childhood . The goal is to not see a human face on FB till Monday December 6th . Support the fight against Child Abuse by copying and pasting this as your status ! 
Flippin ' blast from the past . I almost forgot about all these awesome old cartoons !! Missing the good old days <3 
Holidays\ 
are tough ....... I wish heaven had a phone .... so I could hear your voice\ 
again . I thought of you today ... but that's nothing new . I thought of \ 
you yesterday and days before that too . I think of you in silence and \ 
often speak your name . All I have are memories and pictures in a \ 
...... frame ....... repost if you have someone in heaven that you miss on \ 
earth .... 
Congrats band kids ! :) Now ... will I stop seeing soooo many posts about your band-o activities ? ;) 
My cat's flippin ' out . Wont stop meowing . Following me incessantly . Every time I try to leave him he paws at my ankle to keep me in place . I picke him up and he gripped on super tight to my arm like a child ... I think he has issues . Haha 
What a shitty day . 
So apparently ... the whole changing your profile picture to your favorite cartoon character thing was actually created by a group of of pedophiles , because if children see pictures of cartoons they will add them , it was currently on the program Internet frauds and will apparently be on tv some time tonight , put this as your status to warn people and change your profile pictures back . Sheesh . Damn Facebook 
Completed and submitted my philosophy term paper . 12 hours early even ! * phew ! * Glad that's over with . Bed time <3 
I'm thinkin ' ... Sims time :) haha 
Okay the Sims is just way too addictive . Had to coax myself off of it so I could go to bed before like , 5 a.m. * cough*Patty*cough * ;) Love ya sis 
Wow . My best friend from the first through third grade just found me on Facebook . Nostalgia is a strange feeling indeed . The way the memories kind of just hit you with even the smallest of reminders . Hmmmm . :) 
Cleaning your room while simultaneously holding up a semi intriguing phone conversation at 1 a.m. is ... exhausting . Goodnight . haha 
I have an addiction ... To shopping ... Especially clothing ... Damn evil clothing stores . 
\This thing is okey mcsmokey skiddly doo\ " \ 
Hangin out at empty UCR with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . Ran from a raccoon . Scary stuff . Haha 
I'm starting to get really sick of retarded doctors . My sister went in to get some metal removed from her arm from the last time she broke it , and in doing so , the idiot RE-BROKE her arm . 
Ahhh . Cozy blanket , new massage chair , and about time for sleep :) 
I spent at least 5 hours completing a term paper for philosophy and turned it in through the online drop box . Apparently , it didn't go through , so I got a zero . I hate technology sometimes . What's wrong with just handing the damn things in ? 
Got my paper submitted . Again . Haha . I have the sweetest T.A ever . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Why are people still awake ? < PROPFIRST > ? < PROPFEMALE > ? Cissy ?... Me ? Oh . Okay goodnight :) ha 
Just realized that , even though my paper ( worth 10% of my grade ) , didn't go through and received a zero , I have an A in my philosophy class because I totally aced my final :D Excited . 
Wow . Can you say ' downpour' ? LOVE IT . :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! :) 
I gave myself a christmas gift today . A clean room . Thank . Goodness . 
I'm having kind of a crud day , but it's funny because two friends I haven't heard from in awhile decided to contact me out of nowhere just about simultaneously . 
Relaxing on my bed , playing the Sims 3 while messing with my new ipod touch and laptop , listening to my old ipod's music on it's ihome , making plans for a kick back tomorrow . I feel like such a brat . haha 
Oops . . . Haha 
Finally home . Pretty tired , but I had a good night . Time for bed . :) 
In kind of a crap mood . Not even sure why . :/ 
Well , no new years plans yet . Boooring . 
Hey I start school again tomorrow !... Crap . :/ 
I seriously worry myself sometimes ... 
New obsession : green tea lattes :) 
Gosh I must be getting older . Some little girl just asked me if I had a daughter . Haha 
I hate doing this :/ This house holds so many memories . . . 
I am physically , emotionally , and mentally EXHAUSTED . Mostly physically . I'm almost sure there's gonna be a pop quiz in my Sociology class tomorrow , and I'm havin ' a rough time gettin ' through the reading . Save me from this madness ! 
Ugh . Whatever . Goodnight . 
It's pretty sad when it takes me about twenty to twenty five minutes to walk to my first class from the parking lot walking as quickly as I can . 
Why is it that short people get the \fun sized\ " thing ? What do average and tall people get ? Huh ? " 
It is CRAZY < PROPFEMALE > where I live . The field by my neighborhood is completely overrun with tumble weeds that are being flung around . Driving to school and such has become like one of those obstacle avoidance driving games . Haha 
Tiiired . Party was kinda slow . Liked it , but not sure I'm cut out for that particular kind socializing . Some guys are just creeps . Ew ... 
Can't believe that I feel ... \ 
Good enough , \ 
I feel good enough . \ 
It's been such a long time coming , but I feel good . \ 
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall . \ 
Pour real life down on me . \ 
' Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough . \ 
Am I good enough for you to love me too ? 
My ipod downlaoaded a song onto itself randomly without taking any money out of my account . It's a good song , and apparently a free one . Is that supposed to happen ? haha 
This is the second time I've asked for a green tea latte and they give me hot chocolate ... Damn coffee bean ! 
Oh my ... Wasn't expecting to feel so much ... 
People who have 100 pictures of themselves making the same stupid face make me nauseous . 
I wish I could understand the words coming from my < PROPFEMALE>'s mouth ... Yeah that might help . :/ 
... I hate school sometimes . 
Power outage . . . Awesome . 
I am sooo sore . Big thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Koch and < PROPFIRST > Knisley for totally wrecking me at fast lap last night . ;P 
Fergie fucked up a perfectly good song . 
Oh he's good ... 
Well ... That sucks . Goodnight . 
71 year old woman foils jewelry heist by beating the men with her purse . You go grandma !! 
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run , outrun my gun and all the other kids with the pumped up kicks better run better run , faster than my bullet . 
What an interesting day/night . I think ... I loved it all ! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Nitahara ! I love you :) 
It's < PROPFIRST>'s Day . My < PROPFIRST > ? Well I have a date with him at 3:00 today . His name ? Mr. Psychology Midterm the 2nd . . . 
\You can't stutter when your talking with your eyes \"" 
It's school . Not a strip club . Put some damn clothes on , yeah ? 
Why don't I ever freaking wake up to my alarms !? 
Wow ... I just realized how much is on my to-do list this week ... I'm screwed :/ 
Must the gym be SO crowded all the time ? :/ 
You can't spell slaughter without laughter . 
My Sociology professor gave us a pop quiz , and put stars next to the correct answer after writing \take a close look * at these answers\ " beforehand . Best . Professor . Ever . " 
Finally home . Wonderful night/morning . Warm cozy bed here I come ! :) 
\Coffee makes me poop\ " ... That's when I knew he was definitely worth my time . :) hahaha " 
I have got to stop procrastinating everything . I mean , it always works out for me , but it's still a terrible habit . But ... Go me ! Got my shit DONE . :) 
Dear < PROPFIRST > CaptainDouchebag Fernelius , I would very much like it if you would stop talking in your sleep . I am trying to watch Tos h.O. K ? Thanks . 
Feel myself getting sick :/ 
I have officially given my mother full permission to throw things at my head in the morning to wake my lazy ass up . Please go easy on me . :/ 
Whoa ... I think I need a pause . 
Last final tomorrow . Blehhh . But then beach trip Friday with the boyfriend , one of the best friends , and one of my girls . <3 
Much needed girl talk with < PROPFEMALE > Fogerty <3 Thanks gorgeous . Missed you . 
Nah it's cool . I wasn't trying to sleep or anything ... 
Helping with club food week at my old high school . Makes me happy I'm not stuck here any longer . 
Answer me this ... Juice it Up or Jamba Juice ? 
Feelin ' pretty good . Love spending time with my baby . He takes my mind off of all the bad stuff <3 
School's ... interesting . Feel like crap . The day just seems to drag on . Hopefully I start feelin ' better so I'm less whiney . :) 
My day got better :) had a long talk with my mamma that felt like it only lasted minutes . Much needed . Love you mamma <3 
I feel like I've stepped into a sauna called Riverside . Sometimes , my ability to tan ridiculously fast is a curse . :/
