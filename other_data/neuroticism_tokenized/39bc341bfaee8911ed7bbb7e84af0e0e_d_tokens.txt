I am just an ignorant little stone living in my own little world . 

Gonna go out BMXing for a little while . Might be able to get a video of myself for you guys :o 
It's too f@#$ing hot outside to do much of anything ! D: I still got a decent BMX session in . My lungs burn a little and my arms are sore haha . 
Just relaxing and listening to music . Just downloaded some slightly old school people I used to listen to back in middle school : POD , Finger Eleven , Trapt , Simple Plan , Rotersand . 
For fuck's sake ... I love how today just ended ... Not ... 
Let . Him . GO ! 
Had a good time despite today's epic failures . :) I'm worn out . My arms are sore like hell . 
There comes a time in every man's life ... when he needs to knock that stupid bitch out ! >:( 
Woo ... Interesting day today ... Too many complications . I kinda miss my simple life .

Today can kiss my ass ... 
Good bye sanity ... Knew you well ... 
Is normal for a man to cry over what he really feels after telling his love the opposite ? 
Is it worth it ? Yes ... 
A lady working for some life insurance company came over today and performed a quick analysis and physical on me . She even < PROPFIRST > some blood ... I hate needles ... I felt really sick right after . I passed out for about 2 hours :\\ 
Got nothing to do today . Anyone play Guild Wars ? 
So stupid ... 
Love\ 
Love is not seen like you see beautiful sunsets\ 
Love has no odor like you smell delightful flowers\ 
Love cannot be tasted like you taste ice cream\ 
Love does not make sound like you hear music\ 
Love must be felt , \ 
but Love is not a physical sensation\ 
Love must be given\ 
Love must be received\ 
Love must be willing , \ 
' n Love must be true\ 
Nothing's better than saying \I love you\ " \ 
ARRGHH !! 
I .... fucking hate today .... 
Guys will go on about their supposed feelings for someone when their ulterior motive is to get into their pants . 
Guys will say \I'll be here for you always\ " and then disappear the very next day . " 
You are only ever truly alone when no one cares about you . 
The world could be ending and I will still sleep like a rock . What is wrong with me ? 
I really can't believe it ... 
Apparently I'm too smart for my own brain and I'm eventually going to go insane . Not too far from the truth whatsoever :) 
Another day for me to hate ... 
Fucking bullshit ... 
So unhappy right now ... * sigh * 
Stupid day ... 
So the new Linkin Park album sucks ( except for a couple songs ) just like the last ... 
Still waiting , but I should probably give up :( 
I would post a new picture of myself but someone wanted it to themselves ;o 
Guess what ? More bullshit ... No surprise there ... 
Going to work , BMXing , and seeing < PROPFEMALE > are pretty much the only 3 things I have been doing since school ended . I have no life . v.v Planning on going for the written exam to get my license one of the Saturdays this month though . 
I'm listening to Asking < PROPFEMALE>'s album Stand Up and Scream . They remind me of Blessthefall a bit . They sound pretty good in my opinion if you're into the whole varied voice thing like harsh voice and screamo and clean vocals sort of thing . 
I got the new Droid X phone :D 
More bullshit ... Happens everytime ... Getting seriously sick and tired of it . 
My mind is a wreck without you ... 
I love Reese's Peanut Butter Cups 
Mom : It's gonna suck when you have to give away your Reese's on Holloween . \ 
Me : ... F@#$ that ! 
Go away , mom ... >_> Now ... 
Today was awesome :D 
Never been so fucking confused in my entire life ... 
LMAO I can't even be suspended from work properly ! I'm too needed haha 
Today , celery attacked me . 
License road test Nov . 6 ! Can't wait ! 
Wtf ? 
Oh familiar feelings ... Didn't think I would face you again ... * sigh * 
I need distractions x.x 
Fuckin ... Blah ... 
Can I go back to bed now ? :( 
I fucking hate the news ... 
So bored that I am botting on Runescape ... >_> 
What do you call a purple waffle when you take the red out ? - \Not pr0n\ " lolwut ? " 
Woah , epic hours this week ! 44 hours ( 41.5 paid) ! 
All I know right now is that I am hungry ... and tired . 
:(

Tears can't even express the fucking hatred and sorrow I feel right now . 
I feel so ... cold ... 
I kept reading that conversation over and over again , so I deleted it . All it did was bring back those feelings . Now if only there was a way to stop thinking about it ... Maybe ... There is one thing but I might regret it ... 
Nevermind . Got something for now 
Got my license ... Yay ... 
People think I'm 20 years old x.x ; 
Too angry to sleep ... -.- 
Frustrated ... 
really hates texting sometimes because of all the typos and misunderstandings because it's TEXT and not words coming out of a mouth >_> 
Wow ... People are fucking retarded at 2 in the morning ... A car jumped the curb in front of my house , barely missed my brother's parkes car , and skid into our fence . Cops , ambulance , fire truck , and a news < PROPFIRST > even drove by ... Ambulance and fire truck are gone now though . No one is hurt . >.> Guy is probably drunk ... 
Now she has me learning how to solve a 4x4x4 Rubik's Cube just so I can teach her how to do it >_> 
* sigh * 
A good night ended on a note that brings up an annoying past ... 
She never called ... :'( 
is highly annoyed with a bunch of things 
The Bird of Hermes is my name , eating my wings to make me tame .

R.I.P. < PROPFEMALE > </3 :'( Could have used a certain someone right about now ... June 2009-January 2010 ( No , my cat did not kill her ) 
Great ... Now both of my grandparents are a hospital ... One with a broken ankle in two different places and the other with the flu . 
I say East Hartford should break out the flamethrowers and have some fun melting all the snow away all over the town . <3 
No work . No school . A lot of snow on the way . What the fuck is there to do ? >_> 
An hour and a half of sleep x.x 
I have chocolate milk . WOOT ! WOOT ! :D I love her haha 
The almighty cat-goddes Ki'Tah will rule us all x.x 
I miss my cat :'( 
Woah ! It's 60 outside ! I'm so going outside ... 
I get my kitten back from the vet today :) 
\We are young . We are young . We drink and we fight and we love just because . We are young . We're on the run . And you're never gonna < PROPMALE > us down . We are young . \ " ~ 3OH ! 3 - We Are Young " 
Numb ... x.x 
Reading to help stay calm ... * sigh *

Not even worth it ... 
Family and I went out to dinner at TGI Fridays :o First \family\ " dinner in a while . " 
What the fuck ever 
Oi ... I have some serious work to do >.< 
Driving a tank on Crysis is fucking impossible -.- 
My muffin got decapitated ! >:( 
Just finished my FINAL shift at the Glastonbury McDonalds ! :D 
I move into my apartment on the 26th :D 
Moved into my apartment . Check . Got all situated in new apartment . Check . Interwebz working . Check . Everything's working out good so far ( minus the couch ) . Just missing one thing but it's okay x.x 
Ha ... First class and I get to leave an hour early :P 
wtf - It's SNOWING !! 
Wow the East Greenwich McDonalds must REALLY want me . I just got a call from them a few minutes ago to schedule that interview I've been meaning to schedule with them like a week or two ago . xD 
* sigh * My stomach is growling like it's empty when I ate a full meal like an hour ago . Or is it churning like I am about to puke ?
