The last dying minutes of the year ... 

????????????????????????????????????? \ 
????????????????????????????????????? 
School starts in 3 days ... 
One shall not know anger , nor hatred , nor love . 
There is no emotion , there is peace . \ 
There is no ignorance , there is knowledge . \ 
There is no passion , there is serenity . \ 
\ 
There is no chaos , there is harmony . \ 
There is no death , there is the Force . 
Love is a raw emotion . If you fall in love , it will dominate your < PROPFEMALE > forever . 
By loving everything without attachment , you will find peace . 
There are always two . No more , no less : A master and an apprentice . 
has chronic depression . :( 
is furious at himself for not making what he should have on the math CRCT !!! 
had an awesome day at school !!! :) 
NOOOOOOO ! NOOOOOOO ! :'( 
Someday , YOU'LL be SORRY !!! 
is experiencing a shudder of electricity through his whole body . It's more of somebody's presense that's making me feel this way ... Someone unexpected . Someone who I'd never thought , I'd run into while holding a < PROPFEMALE > Wars novel . Someone whose mere presense and sight made me run quickly and listen to the Jedi Code , telling me to be mindful of my thoughts ... Her name , I can not mention . 
Adventure . Heh ! Excitement . Heh ! A Jedi craves not these things ! 
Into exile , I must go . Failed , I have . 
has failed :( I must understand that a Jedi is a Jedi , first and foremost , and only . For a Jedi to divide his attention between the will of the Force and the will of others is to invite disaster . If only I was a potential Padawan while I was a young child and not admitted late . :( The attachment to an individual is growing stronger inside of me ... and I can't stop it . :( 
Omg . My friends went from 91 to 89 . Another individual blocked me . SCREW YOU PEOPLE !!! 
There is no escape . Don't make me destroy you ... Luke , you do not yet realize your importance . You have only begun to discover your power . Join me , and I will complete your training . With our combined strength , we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy . 
If you're not with me ... then you're my enemy ! 
Obi-Wan : It's over Anakin ! I have the high grounds ! \ 
Anakin : You underestimate my power ! \ 
Obi-Wan : Don't try it . \ 
Anakin : ( screams)\ 
Obi-Wan : You were the Chosen One ! It was said that you would destroy the Sith , not join them ! Bring balance to the Force , not leave in darkness ! \ 
Anakin : ( screams ) I HATE YOU !!! \ 
Obi-Wan : You were my brother Anakin . I loved you . 
Anakin : You turned her against me ! \ 
Obi-Wan : You have done that yourself ! \ 
Anakin : You will not take her from me ! \ 
Obi-Wan : Your anger and your lust for power have already done that . You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now ... until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy . \ 
Anakin : Don't lecture me Obi-Wan . I see through the lies of the Jedi . I do not fear the dark side as you do ! 
Anakin : I'd much rather dream about Padme . Just being around her again is ... intoxicating . \ 
Obi-Wan : Be mindful of your thoughts Anakin , they betray you . You have made a commitment to the Jedi Order , a commitment not easily broken . 
Darth Vader : Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father . \ 
< PROPMALE > : He told me enough ! He told me YOU killed him ! \ 
Darth Vader : No . I am your father . \ 
< PROPMALE > . No . That's not true . That's impossible ! \ 
Darth Vader : Search your feelings , you know it to be true ! \ 
< PROPMALE > : NOOO ! NOOOOOO ! 
Don't underestimate the Force . 
Mace Windu : I am going to end this , once and for all ! \ 
Anakin : You can't . He must stand trial ! \ 
Mace Windu : He has control of the Senate and the Courts ! He's too dangerous to be left alive ! \ 
Anakin : It's not the Jedi way . He must live ! \ 
Palpatine : Please don't!\ 
Anakin : I need him ! \ 
Palpatine : PLEASE DON'T!\ 
Anakin : NO !!! ( slices off Windu's hand)\ 
Mace Windu : ( Screams)\ 
Palpatine : POWER !!! UNLIMITED POWER !!! 
Yoda : Not if anything to say about it , I have ! At an end , your rule is ! And not short enough , it was . If so powerful you are , why leave ? ( activates lightsaber ) . \ 
Darth Sidious : You will not stop me ! Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us ! ( activates lightsaber ) . \ 
Yoda : Faith in your new apprentice , misplaced may be , as is your faith in the dark side of the Force . 
Anakin : It wouldn't have to be that way . We could keep it a secret . \ 
Padme : Then we'd be living a lie . One we couldn't keep up with no matter what . I couldn't do that . Could you Anakin ? Could you live like that ? \ 
Anakin : No . You're right . It would destroy us . \ 
Me : ... And it did . 
Darth Sidious : Lord Vader . Can you hear me ? \ 
Darth Vader : Yes , Master . Where is Padme ? Is she safe ? Is she alright ? \ 
Darth Sidious : It seems that in your anger , you killed her . \ 
Darth Vader : I ? I couldn't have ! She was alive ! I felt it ! \ 
Darth Vader : ( damages everything around him with the power of his rage and grief ) . NOOOOOOOOOOOO !!! 
Mace Windu : You are under arrest , my lord ! \ 
Darth Sidious : Anakin , I told you it would come to this ! I was right . The Jedi are taking over ! \ 
Mace Windu : The oppression of the Sith will never return ! You have lost ! \ 
Darth Sidious : No . No , no , YOU will die ! ( blasts Force lightning on Mace Windu)\ 
Darth Sidious : He's a traitor !!! 
You have failed me for the last time , Admiral ! 
Obi-Wan : I have failed you , Anakin . I have failed you . \ 
Anakin : I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over ! \ 
Obi-Wan : Anakin , Chancellor Palpatine is evil ! \ 
Anakin : From my point of view , the Jedi are evil ! \ 
Obi-Wan : Well then you are lost ! 
Darth Vader : I've been waiting for you Obi-Wan . We meet again at last . The circle is now complete . When I left you , I was but the learner , now I am the Master . \ 
Obi-Wan : Only a Master of evil , Darth ! \ 
Darth Vader : Your powers are weak , old man . \ 
Obi-Wan : You can't win , Darth . If you strike me down , I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine . 
Palpatine did horrible things to him . Made him suspicious of his friends so they wouldn't be friends anymore . Made him kill younglings so no one would ever trust him again . Made him alone . Made it so nobody else in the universe understood him ... except Palpatine . I bet , just before he became Darth Vader , he probably hated Palpatine . But Palpatine had worked it out so that he was the only one Anakin Skywalker had . 
A Jedi is a Jedi , first and foremost , and only . For a Jedi to divide his attention between the will of the Force and the will of others is to invite disaster . 
Do not see a lightsaber duel as a choice between winning and losing . Every duel can have many , many outcomes . When you concentrate solely on winning—in lightsaber duels as in everything else—you sully your victory . Winning becomes worse than losing . It is better to lose than to win badly . And it is always better to end a duel peacefully than to win or lose . 
Learn to recognize when speed is not important . Race when being first is important ; move at your own pace at all other times . It is not necessary to always strike the first blow , to provide the first solution , or to reach a goal before anyone else does . In fact , it is sometimes vital to strike the last blow , to give the final answer , or to arrive after everyone else . 
The acceptance of others is not a guarantee . Like everyone else , a Jedi is accepted or not based on his behavior . The Jedi who believes that he is more important than others only demonstrates that his opinion is to be ignored . 
I wear my robe so that I am warm ; I < PROPFEMALE > my lightsaber so that I am safe ; and I keep enough credits for my next meal , so that I am not hungry . If the Force wants me to have more , it finds a way of letting me know . 
Empathy is a Jedi trait . Empathy leads to understanding , understanding leads to compassion , compassion leads to love . There is no place for love for a Sith . Only hate . 
I crave only power and purpose . With power , anything you want or need can simply be taken . With purpose , life has meaning . 
Age is indeed a curious thing . As I grow older , I see less clearly in the dark , but I see the dark more clearly . 
Failure has a thousand explainations , success doesn't need one . 
Who's the more foolish , the fool , or the fool who follows him ? 
It is not enough that I succeed . Everyone else , must fail . 
Your anger gives you great power . But if you let it ... it will destroy you . 
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength . They think inward , only about themselves . 
Always two , there are . No more , no less : A master and an apprentice . 
Deliver more than you promise . The best way to be always certain of this is to deliver much , even when you promise nothing . 
Hey ! This rocks ! Hey ! 
Until the possible becomes actual , it is only a distraction . 
When you look at the dark side , careful you must be ... for the dark side looks back . 
Listen to the Force , Cade . A Jedi's first concern is to preserve life . 
Fear attracts the fearful , the strong , the weak , the innocent , the corrupt . Fear . Fear is my ally . 
Strong am I with the Force , but not that strong . Twilight is upon me , and soon night must fall . That is the way of things ... the way of the Force . 
Ulic Qel-Droma : Master Arca , Freedon Nadd was a Jedi . How can a Jedi , trained in the ways of the light , fall victim to the Dark Side ? \ 
Arca Jeth : It has happened more than once . Fortunately it does not happen often—Ulic , my son pray that it never happens to you . 
Nadd spoke of the ancient Sith foretellings that the Dark Lords will come again . I heard similar stories from the Jedi Holocron . These prophecies chill my blood . There may be something to them but the future depends on us . We Jedi must cling to the light . The light is our strength and our ally . With the light of the Force , the Jedi will stand forever Remember , Ulic where there is light there can be no darkness . 
At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi . At last we will have revenge . 
Here I stand , helpless and left for dead . :( 
Jedi don't friend Sith who are obsessed with the dark side of the Force . If they want to start arguments over the Force , they're on ! 
Screw Palpatine . May he rot forever in the Netherworld of the Force . 
Obi-Wan ... promise me you will train the boy . He ... is the Chosen One . He ... will bring balance . Train him . 
All this thought about the Galactic Civil War and World War II has led me to asking this question : Who was worse : Palpatine or Hitler ? 
A Jedi does not cling to the past . 
If < PROPFEMALE > Wars didn't exist , then I wouldn't give a hoot about YouTube . 
I'm not a perfect person . There are many things that I wish I didn't do . But I continue learning . I never meant to do those things to you . 
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power . It's an energy field created by all living things . It surrounds us , penetrates us , and binds the galaxy together . 
There are many realities in the universe , some of them quite harsh . One reality that is inescapable is that there is nothing more valuable than a friend . More than food , more than shelter , and more than weaponry , an ally can save your life . 
Duel of the Fates . 
Across the Stars 
Battle of the Heroes 
Anakin's Betrayal 
The Imperial March 
Apology accepted , Captain Needa . 
I don't have the answer to why he turned . I can only ask myself that question , over and over again . 
Every second , you are closer to death . 
She actually still EXISTS !!! ( Not that I thought that she didn't still exist ) . BUT I SAW HER !!! FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS !!! 
It's better to never start something , than to start it and never finish it . Once you start something , you MUST finish it . 
Obi-Wan Kenobi : Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me ? \ 
Anakin Skywalker : Don't say that , Master . You're the closest thing I have to a father . 
You know , don't you ? If the Jedi destroy me , any < PROPMALE > of saving her will be lost . 
Anakin , our allegiance is to the Senate , not to its leader . 
is once again depressed , alone , and ... SCREWED !!! :'( 
Don't go . Your presence is soothing . Your absence is distressful . But yet , you refuse to notice my presence and leave me ... alone and depressed . :'( 
I'm sorry that I hurt you . It's something I must live with everyday . And all the pain I put you through . I wish that I could take it all away . And me the one who catches all your tears . That's why I need you to hear . I found out a reason for me to change who I used to be . A reason to start over new . And the reason is you . 
I sense much hatred in you . Much arrogance . You tend to cling to the past and focus very little on the present . You lack compassion . You lack empathy . You lack sympathy . Or is it just towards me ? All of your hatred , your lack of compassion and sympathy . Is it all just towards me ? I don't have the answer . I can only ask myself that question , over and over again . 
is experiencing panic attacks , stress , depression , and headaches . :'( 
Miss . Arrogant-Lady . Stop tormenting me . The mind can only take so much . 
Poison in my bloodstream . Suffering on my mind . Pain and grief in my heart . Tears on my face . Death in my future . Here I stand now ... helpless and left for dead . :'( 
Do a thousand good deeds and people will forget them . Do ONE bad thing and people will remember it forever , and you will be hated forever . But you will never be remembered or liked again for all of those thousands of good deeds that you once did . Leaving a bad lasting impression of yourself on others can destroy you . Never make this mistake , as I did . It will destroy you , as it does me , a little bit each day . :'( 
Attachment clouds my vision . People act irrationally and unpredictably when they are emotionally attached to another person or an object . That irrational behavior causes pain , regretted acts , and more irrational behavior when the person or object is threatened . I MUST come to my senses . I MUST be more mindful of my thoughts , because so far , all they’ve done is betrayed me . :( 
Things that are on my mind : \ 
People just ain't no good . A thing that's well understood . \ 
The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am . \ 
I HATE YOU !!! \ 
PLEASE DON'T!!!\ 
NO !!! * SCREAMS and CRIES*\ 
SCARRED FOREVER ... 
Please say something to me . You can't be silent forever . I sense your presence fading ... fading . I have said it many times : I'm sorry that I hurt you . It's something I must live with everyday . I don't know what I have done to you . I don't know why you won't speak to me . These are things that I can only ask myself , over and over again . :( 
< PROPMALE > , you do not yet realize your importance . You have only begun to discover your power . Join me , and I will complete your training . With our combined strength , we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy . 
It's the V to the A to the D E R . Vader reconstructing the Death < PROPFEMALE > . With my slick suite suit that's black like tar . 
Secrets are dangerous . \ 
Secrets are difficult . \ 
Secrets can kill . 
8th grade < PROPFEMALE > has revealed its true identity . It's no more the calm , serene , peaceful , and welcoming class that it was during the first couple of weeks of school . It is now a stressful , scary , difficult , and panic-inducing class . 
I still have much to learn . 
I am a math teacher . I am a banana . Only one of these statements is true and the other is a lie . I don't have yellow skin and I'm not a good source of vitamins , so my inductive reasoning says that I'm not a banana . So if I'm not a banana , then I must be a math teacher . 
< PROPMALE > + Charter Internet = Peace of mind and success .? 
is now officially refreshed , re-energized , refueled , and replenished . ( For now , anyway ) . Saturdays are awesome ! ? 
It's ironic that the Chosen One was actually engineered by a Sith Lord . 
Darth Vader will never return to Tatooine . 
Darth Sidious killed Darth Plagueis , but Darth Plagueis ' creation killed Darth Sidious . 
Anakin Skywalker : Don't say that , Master . You're the closest thing I have to a father . \ 
... Decades later\ 
Darth Vader strikes down his former master with no hesitation . 
Brightstorm is awesome . 
DSL on my computer is a new experience .? 
She hardly even recognized me . I've thought about her everyday since we parted and she's forgotten me completely . 
Uphill Rush 
The first < PROPFEMALE > of light in your universe brings pain . The light burns you . It will always burn you . Part of you will always lie upon black glass sand beside a lake of fire while flames chew upon your flesh .? 
You can hear yourself breathing . It comes hard , and harsh , and it scrapes nerves already raw , but you cannot stop it . You can never stop it . You cannot even slow it down . You don't even have lungs anymore . Mechanisms hardwired into your chest breathe for you . They will pump oxygen in your bloodstream forever . 
My , my this here Anakin guy may be Vader someday later , now he's just a small fry . 
The dark is generous , and it is patient , and it always wins -- but in the heart of its strength lies weakness : one lone candle is enough to hold it back . \ 
Love is more than a candle . \ 
Love can ignite the stars . 
If another day goes by and I don't see you , I will die ! :'( \ 
Your serene and soothing presence . \ 
Your distressing and painful absence . 
GEM 
is depressed :( ? 
Pain and suffering . Stress and depression . Panic attacks and hypertension . What do they all have in common ?? 
HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! 
There is no such thing as a second < PROPMALE > . 
Why can't we be friends ? Why can't we start over new ? Why can't you forget the past and focus on the present ? Why do you hate me , so much ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Why ? 
Safari 5 is so blazing FAST ! Screw Internet Explorer 8 ! Safari is awesome ! 
Sometimes there are things that even a computer cannot undo . Sometimes your one action is a final and permanent one . There is no second < PROPMALE > . You cannot go back . You cannot undo your action . 
There are just not enough hours in a day . 
You are so ... beautiful . 
< PROPMALE > OS X Snow Leopard . \ 
The world's most advanced operating system . Finely tuned . 
< PROPMALE > - made from beautiful materials -- aluminum and glass . Has the latest technology . Powerful processors , advanced graphics , and fast memory . Polished , smooth , shiny , refined , strong , and durable appearance and feel . Everything you want . It's designed to be a better computer . 
I love Apple products !!! :) ? 
is a failure . 
has bleeding lips , red eyes , frazzled hair , and headaches . 
Some teachers are impossible to talk to .? 
Is there a substitute for sleep ?? 
I've been working all day and all I've been thinking about is : What if this doesn't get done in time ? Does anyone know how much panic and stress that causes ? Sometimes I begin to think if there really are enough hours in a day . 24 hours just doesn't seem enough . It's either that or the human body is too fragile . 
If anyone wants to know how I feel right now , spell \desserts\ " backwards . " 
How is it possible to hate someone THAT much ? You wouldn't care if a Sith tried to kill me , whereas if a Sith tried to kill YOU , I would save you and destroy the Sith . I would never stop caring no matter what you say or do . If you still don't care , at least don't be silent . Tell me what I've done to you that's angered you so much so I can feel terrible about it forever . 
< PROPFEMALE > nikada ne ? e poput mene opet ... i to je moja krivnja . Mogao < PROPFIRST > sprije ? iti ovo . To ? e nanijeti bol na mene zauvijek . < PROPFEMALE > nikada ne mogu oprostiti sebi . Zašto ? Zašto se ovo dogodilo ? :'( 
Zašto mrziš me toliko ? Što < PROPFIRST > u ? inio za vas ? 
Obožavam te . 
Mir uma . 
Nitko ne brine . Ljudi na Zemlji su tako glupi . Svatko bi trebao živjeti u teškim uvjetima i vidjeti kakav je to osje ? aj ! 
I am going for some changes . I don’t know what is going on . Something is happening to me . Something is happening to me . Is it too late to save me from myself after all the damage done ? Is it too late ? I wish there was some way that I could put me back the way I was .? 
My math grade is suffering :( ? 
Having fun and being happy is a waste of time . We have precious LIMITED time . All life-forms eventually die . We should use what time we have and do something useful and serious . A second wasted is a second gone forever and a second closer to death . I will never understand the phrase \go have fun\ " when there is so much work to get done and a day only has 24 hours . " 
is a doomed failure at everything . FAILURE . FAILURE . FAILURE . 
is re-living the great moments of 7th grade . 
Pain , suffering , death . 
What's the point in all this screaming , no one's listening anyway . 
Its hard to tell your mind to stop loving someone if your heart still does . 
There's still hope ...? 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THOSE PLANS ?!? 
NOOO !!! 
I HAVE ALL A'S!!! YES !!! WELL THAT CERTAINLY BRINGS DOWN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION !!! FINALLY I CAN ENJOY A MOMENT OF PEACE !!! 
Peace of mind . 
The return of stress and anxitey D: 
Hey check out this vid chat room - http://tinychat.com/nunnie101 
THIS WEEK WILL BE SO FREAKING BORING !!! 
I MISS ALL MY BUDDIES WHO ARE AT SAPELO !!! :( 
Here I am , screaming at myself . Trying desperately to undo my mistakes , but all attempts failed . What have I done ? I have repeated so many of my mistakes . I'm such a fool . I never learned from them . The only true mistake is one from which you DON'T learn from . < sigh > I'm so depressed . :'( ? 
ALL OF MY BUDDIES WHO WENT TO SAPELO ARE BACK !!! I GET TO SEE THEM AGAIN !!! :D :D :D :D 
I'm like obsessed with this song !? 
Love . It can bring someone back from the dark side .? 
just got BitDefender Total Security 2011 !!!? 
There is so much work in so little time .? 
November 3 and 4 will be days long remembered . Does anyone know why ?? 
Happiness is temporary . Suffering and depression are permanent . 
All I can do is sit in a dark room , listen to my Masters scream at me , and hope that everything will be all right ... someday . 
WHY DO I LIKE YOU ?! I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER MYSELF !!! I NEED HELP , MASTER YODA ! TELL ME HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ! 
I don't love you anymore . ( Thanks for the help , Obi-Wan Kenobi , Qui-Gon Jinn , Master Yoda , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Organa , Padme Amidala , Darth Vader , and General Grievous . I don't think I like her anymore . I'm on my way to becoming a successful and accomplished Jedi ) . 
Day 2 Lecture from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader -- success ! 
Never . I'll never turn to the dark side . I am a Jedi . 
So be it . 
Everyone hates me .? 
Anakin\ 
Skywalker : Don't be afraid . \ 
Padme Amidala : I'm not afraid to die . I've \ 
been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life . \ 
Anakin : What are you talking about ? \ 
Padme : I love you . \ 
Anakin : You love \ 
me ? I thought we had decided not to fall in love . That we would be \ 
forced to live a lie . That it would destroy our lives . \ 
Padme : I think our\ 
lives are about to be destroyed anyway . 
just got Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2010 !!! 
I LOVE INTERNET EXPLORER 9 !!! 
Posted from Windows 7 :D 
Severe depression . I can't take it anymore :'( 
is having the best computer experience ever ! 
Why ? 
La razón eres tu . 
just got Google Chrome 9 !!! 
just got Firefox 4 !!! 
The dream I just had--I'm utterly astounded . WHY ?! WHY COULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN A REALITY ?! IT WAS ALL SO REAL THEN !!! 
Only I can live ... forever . \ 
-- Voldemort 
The only stable browser I have is ... Safari . 
The return of stress , depression , and panic attacks D: 
When is the right time to use Firefox 4 ? When is the right time to use Google Chrome 9 ? When is the right time to use Safari 5 ? When is the right time to use Internet Explorer 9 ? 
I hate that I'm so interdependent . Why do I need other individuals if my mere existence is so annoying to them ? I honestly DON'T want to interact with ANYBODY that's not of authority ... but then again , everything's easier said than done . < sigh > 
That's it . 
:'( 
Living is hard . I can't live with all this pain anymore ... how much can I take ? 
Tell me what you regard as your greatest\ 
strength , so I will know how best to undermine you ; tell me of your \ 
greatest fear , so I will know which I must force you to face ; tell me \ 
what you < PROPFEMALE > most , so I will know what to take from you ; and tell me\ 
what you crave , so that I might deny you 
A horcrux . 
Voldemort is my past , present , and future . 
His boggart ... is his own corpse . 
IS SCREWED !!! 
Death Week 
I'M SCREWED !!! I FAILED !!! I DIDN'T CALL THIS DEATH WEEK FOR NOTHING !!! ( Maybe I should change my profile picture . I'm kind of making this smart guy look bad ) . 
What's with some people and San < PROPFIRST > ? Is that where pedophiles live or something ? 
Why does everyone assume that < PROPFEMALE > Wars people on Facebook are pedophiles ? 
I don't appreciate it when people argue over things they don't understand . My < PROPFEMALE > Wars friends are one of the most helpful and interesting people I've met . I've learned so much from them . They've redirected me to things I never knew about or would have discovered . I've gained knowledge and experience from that . I don't like it when people talk lowly about them ... 
Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it . 
There is no happiness or relaxation . There is only tragedy and work . 
Humans would be so much more successful if no one needed each other . 
Snow , cloudiness , cold . What a perfect day to stay in and finish up the remainder of my homework ... 
Stress can kill ... slowly . 
NOOOOOOO !!! HOW MUCH CAN I FREAKIN ' TAKE IT ?!!! I'M HERE LITERALLY DYING IN STRESS AND PANIC ATTACKS AND I COME LOOK AT MY HORRENDOUS FINAL EXAM GRADE !!! DOES ANYONE REALIZE HOW MUCH THAT PHYSICALLY HURTS THIS LATE AT NIGHT ?!!! I'M LUCKY I'M STILL ALIVE !!! 
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS !!! AS A STUDENT , GRADES ARE ALL THAT MATTERS !!! NOTHING ELSE !!! ONCE EDUCATION IS OVER , PERSONAL LIFE MATTERS !!! UNTIL THEN , GRADES ARE THE ONLY THING THAT ANYONE SHOULD OBSESS ABOUT !!! I SO FREAKIN ' HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF THEM AS \JUST NUMBERS \"!" 
Suffering ... endless suffering . That's what life is . 
Without a soul , my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold ... 
Mental pain hurts more than physically pain , because physical pain is temporary , whereas mental pain is not . 
My grade . My grade . As of right now , that's all I care about . 
There is only depression and despair . 
A whole day of literally nothing but listening to depressing songs and shedding tears . 
Blood loss . That's a terrible death . 
Como me duele ... 
I wish I could contact the teachers ... 
Friday , March 31 , 1995 at 1:05 PM was one of the saddest times in history . That date and time will never be forgotten and continue to depress people of the future forever . 
There is never an end to worrying . 
Death . 
Why am I the only person on < PROPFEMALE > Virtual School ?! What's everyone else doing ?! 
The universe is an intricate place full of tragedy , suffering , and the unknown ... 
Dying is painful . 
Happiness is temporary ; depression is chronic . 
The whole world is so unemotional ... 
Someday , you'll be sorry ! Someday you will ALL be sorry ! 
Pretty soon , I'll have a shattered heart and I'll do nothing more but exist in this intricate , cruel , and harsh world . 
When time passes , you can never get that time back . It's gone ... forever . 
The voices of the past ... I can hear them , but they are not here . 
Tears of blood . 
There is no such thing as a painless death . 
< PROPFEMALE > VIRTUAL SCHOOL IS OPEN FOR TAKING ASSIGNMENTS , QUIZZES , DISCUSSIONS , AND TESTS !!!... I wonder if we can work ahead ... 
< sigh > The return of work . 
It's a miracle . I have all A's . 
MATH IS SO HARD NOW ! 
I am desperately in need for some energy boosters ... 
Mmm ... energy boosters really refresh the body and mind , as well as calming panic attacks . ( Temporarily ) . 
SO MANY UNREALISTIC AMOUNTS OF UPCOMING WORK !!! >:O 
JUST TO LET EVERYONE KNOW , THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH SNOW TO CANCEL SCHOOL , ASSUMING THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY SNOW AT ALL ! OKAY ?!!! 
THIS \SNOW\ " DIDN'T EVEN HOLD TOGETHER !!! >:O " 
Expressed excitement and happiness leads to failure and frustration . Depression and dreariness leads to focus , inner peace , and mental calmness . 
WTF , THERE IS NO SCHOOL TOMORROW EITHER ??!!! THIS SUCKS CRAP !!! 
I'm screwed . 
Monday no school = understandable . Tuesday no school = wow . Wednesday no school = ridiculous . Thursday no school = WTF , WE JUST CAME BACK FROM WINTER BREAK AND HAD THREE DAYS OF SCHOOL !!! NOW THEY'RE CANCELING SCHOOL WHEN WE SHOULD BE HAVING IT ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I DEMAND SPRING BREAK TO BE CANCELED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
EVERYONE , LET'S ADD AN EXTRA WEEK AT THE END OF SCHOOL ! 
I'm such an idiot . Why else would I fail at simple things ? 
What now ? 
HELP ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOMEONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Take a look at my life , all black\ 
Take a look at my clothes , all black\ 
Like < PROPFIRST > Cash , all black\ 
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black\ 
Like the night that we met , all black\ 
Like the color of your dress , all black\ 
Like the seats in my Cadillac\ 
I used to see red now it's just all black 
IN 6 HOURS AND 2 MINUTES , WE SHALL ALL RETURN TO SCHOOL !!! 
I am a perfectionist . 
Three hours of sleep a day ... 
My body is producing too much fatigue toxins ... 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone ! 
\I can't be seen with you . \ " \ 
\Figure it out ! \ " \ 
Me : Hey , how do you solve this ? \ 
Tomislav : Your mom . \ 
-- Tomislav Z-m and Zehadi Nirman 
I have repaired my body and my mind . 
I'm BACK ! 
I'M READY FOR TRIUMPH ! TRIUMPH ! TRIUMPH ! 
I will be returning to my state of being from more than a month ago . 
VOTE FOR < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFIRST > !!! NOBODY ELSE !!! AND THE ONLY REASON YOU SHOULD DO THAT IS BECAUSE TOMISLAV SAYS SO !!! WHATEVER HE SAYS IS RIGHT !!! SINCE HE'S A SUPPORTER , YOU ALL MUST VOTE FOR MO AND < PROPFIRST > !!! 
I am disabling all communications with other living flesh . No one talk to me . I'm inferior . 
Independence is the key to success . Dependence leads to failure and betrayal . 
I don't get how people use Safari on a PC . It's SO slow ! 
WHAT ?! I SPEND THE WEEKEND FINISHING ALL THOSE MATH ASSIGNMENTS AND ( EVEN THOUGH I MADE 100s ON THREE ON THEM ) THEY DIDN'T RAISE MY GRADE BY EVEN A POINT ?!!?!?!? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT ?! 
Reading logs , A Shakespeare play for an abstract , the Elizabethan Fair , hard stuff and STUPID CARELESS mistakes from me that gets me a SUCKY 94 ... yep ... I'm screwed . 
No matter how hard I try , I still fail ... 
Depending on others leads to failure . 
\It is not enough that I succeed ... everyone else must fail \"" 
Honestly , I think I take better care of my computer than I do myself ... 
The Elizabethan Fair ... it's harder than I thought ... I'm screwed . 
We are probably among the smartest , most intelligent person on Earth , but we don't even know it ( except for me , of course ) . 
Theta sessions are very good at replacing 4 hours of sleep . < PROPFEMALE > sessions are excellent at rejuvenating the body with 2 hours of sleep . I think I've solved my sleep deficiency problems ... 
Wise men profit more from fools than fools from wise men ; for the wise men shun the mistakes of fools , but fools do not imitate the successes of the wise . 
If you have made mistakes , even serious ones , there is always another < PROPMALE > for you . What we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down . 
I daresay one profits more by the mistakes one makes off one's own bat than by doing the right thing on somebody's else advice . 
Strange . I had a dream about the former person I liked . What could this mean ...? 
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving . 
OMG , WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT ?! I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT YOU GOT THAT KIND OF A REPLY . SERIOUSLY YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME BEFORE YOU SENT THAT ! SERIOUSLY I HAVE TRIED . BELIEVE ME I HAVE ! IT DOESN'T WORK ! IT NEVER WILL ! I TRIED TO FORGET IT . PLEASE DO NOT REMIND ME OF ALL THAT I WENT THROUGH BEFORE ! I AM A DEPRESSO AND YOU ASKING HER THAT AND GETTING THAT KIND OF REPLY ONLY ENHANCES IT ! 
I'm hacked off . No one talk to me . Ever . 
Lifted head fog , increased mind power , neural pathway growth , improved study , and lasting energy . 
I am a failure that made a 26 on an assignment . 
Dinner at 3:53 AM . lol 
Wow , it's almost 5 AM and I'm still up practicing for the word parts quiz . After this , I think I better go and consolidate my memory . 
I'm going to end my friendship with a lot of people . 
WHAT THE CRAP ?! I CANNOT HAVE AN 83 IN SOCIAL STUDIES ! NOT SOCIAL STUDIES ! ONE OF THE MOST FREAKIN ' EASIEST CLASSES ! THAT'S IT ! I'M SUCH AN IDIOT FAILURE ! I GOT A 26 ON AN ASSIGNMENT !!! WHY !? AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY MADE A 100 ON THAT ?! THAT'S IT ! I'VE HAD IT ! I'M NEVER GOING TO RECOVER FROM A SULKY MOOD UNTIL I GET MY GRADE WHERE IT SHOULD BE ! HERE NOW OFFICIAL : NOBODY TALK TO ME EVER AGAIN ! 
YOU'RE the weak one ... and you'll never know love or friendship ... and I feel sorry for you . \

I've just made my desktop more aesthetically appealing . 
Capital punishment is the cruelest and most painful thing you can do to someone . I can't think of anything that hurts ( physically ) more . 
Dumbo is like the most annoying show ! \ 
-- < PROPFEMALE > English 
I'm sorry pillow . You've drowned in my tears ... :'( 
It is not our abilities that make us who we are , but rather our choices . 
The magnificent power of the subconscious mind . 
Google Chrome uses too much memory ... or maybe it's just the extensions . 
Ticked off that I made an 80 on the Radical Expressions Task , but satisfied that I have a 95 in math . 
Dumbo is a horrible show ! \ 
This isn't working . How about we just go back to me being silent ? I think people will like that a lot more . I just need a freakin ' pair of headphones . 
Screw < PROPFEMALE > Umbridge . May she receive The Dementor's Kiss . 
The actor who plays Dumbledore after the second movie ruined the whole character as Dumbledore . DUMBLEDORE NEVER FREAKIN ' YELLS ACROSS THE ROOM OR IN A STUDENT'S FACE ! 
is once again re-living the < PROPFEMALE > days . May I'll actually experience it again this year . I can only hope . 
Ms. McNeeley is an awesome teacher . She gives a taste of what real life feels like and not the laziness and stupidity we've grown in . The proof of that are all the people who insult her and the work she assigns in their statuses . 
I'M SCREWED ! D: 
PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY HATE ME FROM THE DEPTHS OF THEIR DARK SOULS ! AND THAT'S THE TRUTH ! AND YES , ONE PERSON DOES COUNT . 
Success is 80% mental and 20% physical . 
I DEMAND TO KNOW HOW YOU CAN GET A 70% AS A GRADE FOR HAVING THE MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTENT FOR AN ASSIGNMENT ! IF YOU'RE NOT GIVEN THE MAXIMUM WORK YOU CAN DO , ALL YOU HAVE LEFT TO WORK WITH IS THE MINIMUM ! IF I HAVE THE MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTENT WHY THE CRAP DID I MAKE 70 AND NOT A 100 ?! AND IT'S A FREAKIN ' SUMMATIVE GRADE ! 
I am a stupid failure face who apparently doesn't do enough work and receive enough self punishment . 
I'M TOTALLY PISSED OFF ! I'M A FAILURE THAT CAN'T RETAIN OR COMPREHEND ANYTHING ! I MAKE TERRIBLE GRADES AND APPARENTLY DON'T TRY HARD ENOUGH ! 
All that we are is a result of what we have thought . 
Wow . I slept from 3 PM to 11 PM . Guess I'll just do math and other schoolwork for the rest of the night . This is how I spent my life on Saturday , March 12 , 2011 . 
Only those who dare to fail greatly , can ever achieve greatly . 
Today on March 14 , 2011 is the FINAL release of Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 !!! 
When you have too much work , where do you start ? 
Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain . 
It's one thing to do something in theory , but another to do it in practice . 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! 
I'M GONNA BE SO HAPPY ONCE THIS PROJECT IS OVER AND I GET MY GRADE ! 
I can't believe you're leaving . It's the last thing I could ever expect . 
The new Google Chrome logo is stupid ! 
Please . 
Please unblock me and be my friend . 
The world is a dark place full of pain and grief . 
Nightmare upon nightmare ... what's happening to me ? 
I am a left brain thinker . 
Internet Explorer 9 is stupid . You can't even use it unless you have a graphics processing unit . Stupid unstable buggy browser . Such a disappointment . 
I am a stupid idiot who fails . 
I'm not good enough .
