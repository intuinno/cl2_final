< PROPFEMALE > Christmas Everyone ! 

Happy New Year ! May all your resolutions come true ! 
How ' Bout Them Cowboys ! 
I'm disappointed about the Cowboys . I am , however , seeing a Saints-Colts Super Bowl in our near future . Awesome ! 
I'm a little late in getting in on the look-alike thing , but here you go . 
There should be better opportunities to add to my photos in the next 4 months . All the photos i have now don't include many people . 
It's a little early , but let me be the first one to say this ...... WHO DAT ?! 
Tomorrow commemorates the anniversary of the brutal slaughter of 7 men in a garage in Chicago . Enjoy ! 
What's the difference between a salschow , a toe loop , a lutz , and a flip ? They all look the same to me . 
I recently encountered a question that i think bears repeating . If < PROPFIRST > cracked corn , but no one cared , why is there a song about him ? :P 
USA ! USA ! USA !, etc . :D 
This is for all you Idol fans . 1 ) VFTW saved < PROPFEMALE > . 2 ) Where were all the < PROPFIRST > fans ? I mean really . < PROPFIRST > Park and < PROPMALE > Urban were much worse than him . 3 ) I'll miss you < PROPFEMALE > ! 
RATS ! Oh , well . we tried . 
Hating < PROPFIRST > Park 
Jammin ' Guitar , but the vocals aren't workin ' for < PROPFIRST > 
That's two . He's become a serial killer . Todrick must be stopped ! 
Thank you judges for saying what I'm thinking . 
So far , other than Ms. Bowersox , all I'm hearing is karaoke . 
Acid Reflux is the bane of my existence ! Ifinally managed to get past a < PROPMALE > problem I encountetred while eating my dinner . For those who knew , and were praying , thank you . 
The last 3-4 girls should be safe . So should Ms. Bowersox . The rest are in trouble . 
VFTW strikes again ! 
< PROPFIRST > better earn his spot ! 
I was born in Denver , Colorado . I didn't get an accent until I got to Texas . Then I lost it again when I had it trained out of me by a voice teacher . 
I finally decided to join Twitter . I must really be bored . 
Well , I guess there isn't a good reason to keep watching the tournament now . No one is left that I care about . 
How great is Big < PROPFIRST > ? 
More like < PROPMALE > \Deer in the Headlights\ " Urban " 
Look out < PROPFEMALE > , here comes < PROPFIRST > ! 
Vacation Day ! I'm going to Opening Day for the Texas Rangers with friends . Talk at ya ' later ! 
Bagpipes and a didgeridoo ? This is the craziest night I've seen on this show ! BTW , nice knowing you < PROPFIRST > . 
Get rid of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , please ! 
It was cool to see Dr. Holcomb last night . His hair is getting shaggy . If he ever decides to stop styling it , he could go for the \Leopold\ " look . " 
< PROPFIRST > and MamaSox are the best of the night ! I'm not sure what will happen with the others . This is Idol Gives Back , no one gets voted off on that week . 
( WARNING : Inside joke to follow ) The difference between baseball and soccer is you aren't allowed to hit the ball with a big stick in soccer . :P 
I'm sorry . I didn't get Siobanh's performance . Either she or Aaaron needs to go home . 
We're off to Boston ! 
Today we switch to the scientific part of our tour . 
I think < PROPFIRST > and Big < PROPFIRST > are in trouble . I liked < PROPFIRST>'s song better than the judges . I do , however , agree with tem on the duets and Crytal's song . 
Go < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! On to the finals ! 
My mom is the best ever ! 
To everyone : Thank you for your birthday wishes . I have had a fantastic day ! 
Hannibal the Klingon was the first mistake 
I was hoping that < PROPFIRST > had more talent . I did like the light show at the beginning . 
I have a theory that most people in the world are crazy . Of course , that means that the sane people are abnormal . :P 
I decided to update my profile with a more professional photo 
Today's new musicals need to have their mouths washed out with soap 
I hereby banish all nightmares from my room . I've got to get some sleep . G'nite Facebookland ! 
Happy Father's Day to all the dads ( including my own) ! 
Wow . Great first quarterfinal match for Uruguay 
Chicago has the best talent ! Wow ! 
I agreed with all the picks except Miss Romer . I thought that Strange Familiar was a much better act . (<PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent ) 
Listening to music from Lord of the Rings trilogy . Thy did such a fantastic job ! I can picture evry scene based on what music is being played . 
< PROPFIRST > was the funniest tonight . That bit about the deer was hilarious ! 
Why < PROPFEMALE > ? Why would you vote for these irritating people over true talent ? 
A very disappointing outing by the Cowboys 
Why is it that when most people have a problem with me , they avoid me ? I've never understood that . 
Some of these 18 -wheelers are getting out of control . I just had one try to run me off the road ! My driver-side mirror is gone . 
Wow , what a great night for < PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent ! 
Driving a rental car in the rain , plus I have to work nights for the next 2 weeks . I'm glad I had a good weekend . 
Had fun in auditions last night . Can't wait to find out the results . 
Never allow pain and paranoia to fuel your imagination . I need some laughter desperately right now . 
Poor passing by Romo . Weird change in defensive strategy in the second quarter . An inconsistent kicker . It's a good thing I'm a pro football fan and not just a < PROPMALE > . 
They have begun offering roles for \A Christmas Carol\ " . This is gonna be awesome ! " 
< PROPMALE > Scandrick is a menace to the team ! 
I am feeling it . GO RANGERS !!!!!! 
Thanks for being a killjoy , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
First Half : Positive- Our quarterback is fighting hard for us . Negative- We have no discipline . Go Cowboys ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is a disaster ! 
Go Benji ! We can still do this ! 
Hamilton strikes again ! 
That last not was just a < PROPMALE > flat . 
Okay , this sucks . We need outs ! 
Thank you < PROPMALE > and Young ! 
I was just wondering something . Are the Yankees worried yet ? 
Feeling under the weather . Unfortunately , I can't stay home . I need the day to go fast . 
3 outs away ! You can almost taste it . 
THE RANGERS WIN THE PENNANT ! In your face A-Rod ! 
I hope that fullback is proud of himself . Romo is probably out for the season . 
I'm over the Cowboys . There are better teams I can watch this season . Go Rangers ! 
Eight songs down , three to go ! ( 4 if you count \Rhinestones on my Touche \")" 
This is not the game I envisioned . At least our offense is trying . 
This game reminds me of Game 5 from the ALCS . 
Dumb , Kinsler . 
Good news for today : The Mavericks won last night , and the Rangers still have 6 games to play in the World Series ! 
I don't think we can come back from being 2 games down . It will still be an awesome run for our Rangers ! 
Did I say the series was over ? No ! Why would I say something like that ? Go Rangers ! 
Awesome season for the Rangers . Sad ending . We'll bring the Claw and Antlers next year ! 
Recording for \A Christmas Carol\ " today . This is gonna be awesome ! " 
Sorry , < PROPFIRST > , but you don't have much of a choice . Either fire < PROPMALE > or face the possibility that no one will come to the home games . 
I'm trying to decide if I even care who is going to the Super Bowl this year . None of the teams seem to care . 
I want to laugh , cry , scream , and sleep all at the same time . How is that possible ? 
For all that you've done and are still doing for us - Thank You Veterans ! 
I get to work a double shift today ........ hooray 
Don't anybody look now , but the Cowboys just outplayed the Giants in the 1st Quarter . 
That's a whole 1st Half where the Cowboys played at this level . 
And the Cowboys did it ! 
Distractions . They come in many different forms . To me , the most insidious is when others try not to distract you . Their absence is very distracting to me . 
Okay , I saw < PROPMALE > Potter last night . I enjoyed the movie except for the scene where < PROPMALE > destroys the horcrux . The nudity was totally unnecessary . 
Last rehearsal for a whole week . Time to rest my voice for a while . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! I am grateful for all my loved ones . I am grateful for my God-fearing church family . Most of all , I'm grateful that Jesus saved me from myself . 
Okay , I've got my plan for Black Friday . Let the Christmas season commence ! 
I was doing fine on my shopping spree .... until I got to the Galleria . Today is not the day to go there folks ! 
Mini-vacation over . Nose meet grindstone . Ugh . 
I sure hope I still have a voice left for Sunday night's concert . The tenor section would be awfully quiet if I didn't sing . 
Change your \ 
FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal is not to \ 
see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . Join the fight \ 
against child abuse & copy & paste to your status and invite \ 
your friends to do the same 
ACC Rehearsal was awesome . Now I've got to finish my Christmas shopping . 
Christmas concert tonight at 5:30 . ' Tis the season ! 
Early call tomorrow for costumes and other such mayhem . 
This is the first Monday in a while that I thoroughly enjoyed . I should be in musicals more often ! 
I very foolishly set a dental appointment for 7 am tomorrow . What was I thinking ? 
Getting ready to head to Day #2 of \A Chhristmas Carol\ " at First Baptist Carrollton . It just keeps getting better ! " 
One more day in Victorian England . They sure sang a lot back then . 
My last note on \A Christmas Carol\ " : < PROPFIRST > - This will definitely become my favorite version ! < PROPFIRST > S . - I think I speak for all the \ " scoundrels\ " when I say thank you for making us look so good ! My fellow cast members- You were all awesome ! " 
Is there such a thing as \musical lag\ " ? My internal chronometer feels off . " 
Going out to look at Christmas lights . I need a little Christmas right now . 
On my way to the Christmas < PROPFEMALE > service at FBCC . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas from all of me to all of you . 
I got Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 DVD for Christmas . Watching it now . They need to make a new one . 
I enjoyed several movies this past year , but my top 5 were : 1 ) Inception 2 ) Book of < PROPMALE > 3 ) Tron : Legacy 4 ) The A-Team 5 ) The Sorcerer's Apprentice 
The worst thing you could wish on someone is that they die alone . 
They are working on a universal translator app . One step closer to < PROPFEMALE > Trek ! 
The Green Hornet . meh 
( Sigh ) 
Bible Study was very interesting tonight . It's too bad that some people had to miss it . 
I'm in the zone . Hoping the trend continues . 
To varying degrees , we always want the approval of the people we love . It may sound obvious , but think about the ramifications . 
It's been an up and down kind of day . good thing I don't get motion sickness anymore . 
I've been in a lousy mood all day . Choir helped some , but I'm still stewing . Hopefully , tomorrow will be better . 
I've said it before : Don't let someone with my imagination stay in a bad mood for too long . 
Just finished watching the DVD of \A Christmas Carol\ " . That was some great camera work ! " 
I'll be at Camp Compass for the next few days . They'll probably make a tv movie about our survival story . 
Snow days are for catching up . On sleep , on tv , etc . 
A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's butt . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died or is fighting cancer , post this for at least one hour 
Just got my first experience with the Wii . I just about hyperextended my elbow trying to bowl strikes . Taking a break from that . 
I'm off to work . I may not be able to access FB for a while . I hope everyone stays safe and warm . 
Being home is awesome ! 
I'm glad I made it home yesterday . Otherwise , I might not have been home until tomorrow afternoon ! This weather is insane ! 
I'm predicting a lot of November babies born in Texas this year . 
The NFL Experience sounds awesome , but I think I'd rather wait and see the Hall of Fame one of these years . ( During the summer ) 
NFL HOF Class of ' 11 was just announced . I agree with most of the picks , but 3 great receivers and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > were snubbed . There were a couple on the class list that could've waited I think . 
Gotta say , that was one of the best SB games I've ever seen . Kudos to both teams ! ( Not so much to the \singers \")" 
Here we go again 
Compared to last week , today was a snap . Still , it's good to be home . 
The NFL has descended into childishness . I think I'll watch soccer this year . Go FC < PROPFIRST > ! 
Finally going to see True Grit . I hope it's worth the wait . 
Today I stand with the teachers , support staff , administrators and school boards of Texas who are fighting for the education of children in Texas . To the Texas Legislature I say : MAKE EDUCATION A PRIORITY . I hope you will change this to your status for the rest of the day 
Jury Duty . Ugh . 
Double shifts the rest of the week and all next week . My joy overfloweth . ( Was that sarcasm over the top ? ) 
I'm off to my audition with AMTC . Wish me luck ! 
Okay Oscars , I'm bored so far . Hooray for Inception ! 
So far , they are spreading the wealth . True Grit is the only film getting the brush . 
Boo ! I liked the score for Inception better . 
What happened to < PROPFEMALE > Johanson's hair ? 
Okay , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is wasting his Broadway potential . 
< PROPMALE > - best speech of the night ! 
Congrats to < PROPMALE>'s Speech . G'nite FB friends ! 
Just watched last night's < PROPFEMALE > . Most of the girls should worry as should Stefano . I would add < PROPFIRST > to that list , but he seems to have a big following for now . < PROPFIRST > Durbin was my favorite of the night . 
I've got a full weekend of training in store at AMTC . Should be fun and exhausting ! 
What's the < PROPFEMALE > got to do with it ? Please make the torture stop ! 
Why am I watching < PROPFEMALE > again ? Other than Thia , no one has stayed on key so far . 
Finally ! Thanks , Stefano . I thought we were never going to hear a good one tonight ! 
< PROPFIRST > is weird . 
Much better , < PROPMALE > . Can we please say goodbye to Naima ?

Copy & paste onto your status for absolutely no good reason whatsoever . 
Had to settle for the luck of the Welsh today . Seems to have worked for me . 
Hooray for Friday ! 
Can't say I'm all that impressed with Super < PROPFEMALE > . I thought it would be bigger . 
The first day of Spring . Hmm ..... no , I got nothing . 
Almost finished with last night's American Idol . Absolutely amazing . Now I believe this is the most talented group they've had in a while . 
People are mad at me . What did I do ? 
While uneventful , it's been a good day . 
VCU ? Unbelievable ! That just leaves Kentucky . 
Long day tomorrow . To the cloud !

Finally finished watching last night's idol . Now that I've seen the results , the only one in the bottom 3 I disagreed with was Thia . I thought Stefano was much worse . He botched the lyrics , and didn't connect with the song . 
Now that I've slept on it , I'm still on the fence about last night's Grey's Anatomy . I was surprised to know McKidd and < PROPFIRST > can sing . 
Headache . Going to bed .
