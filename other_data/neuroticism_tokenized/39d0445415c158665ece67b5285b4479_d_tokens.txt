A conversation is a dialogue , not a monologue . That's why there are so few good conversations : due to scarcity , two intelligent talkers seldom meet . 

ahhh happiness ...

i think i deserve an a+ for the day ... 
Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves . 
We often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude . 
Being sorry is the highest act of selfishness , seeing value only after discarding it . 
Spring break is AWESOME so far ... 
;) 
Treat a person as he is , and he will remain as he is . Treat him as he could be , and he will become what he should be . \ " , 2011-03-28 16:38:32 "
