Just spent close to 5 hours trying to figure out the ISU system of scoring Figure Skating and I now have a good handle on the way jumps are scored . Too bad that's not even half of it ! > < 
Jesus reigns in this place , showers of mercy and grace , falling on every face , there is FREEDOM ! 
Where the spirit of the Lord is , there is Freedom !

New Phone number everyone ! 240-393-9375 
' s iPhone has also led him to upgrade to iTunes Plus ..... It's an extra 30% to the cost of songs and videos but 256k AAC ( mp4 audio ) encoding is simply the best you can get without buying the CDs ! 
temporarily loses some of his sanity every time he studies . If he says or does weird things right after studying , please don't mind him ! 
OS X Kernel Panics got nothing on me ! 
Just got the memory upgrade and wifi card for the iBook G4 . I'm ready to go ! 
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some people , eager for money , have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs . But you , man of God , flee from all this , and pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , endurance and gentleness . -1 < PROPFIRST > 6:10 -11

< PROPFIRST > Yu-Na just got a 76.08 !!!! Over 17 points ahead of < PROPFEMALE > Asada ! 
Short Program = 76.08 , Long Program = 133.95 ( New World Record ) , Total = 210.03 ( New World Record ) At this point , its safe to say < PROPFIRST > Yu-na is a clear favorite for Olympic gold . 
: I wish I was travelling more 
why do I do these passive-aggressive things ? 
seriously entertaining thoughts about driving to cali and back 
Why in the world would you constantly defriend and then readd me ? No more of this . Not accepting your friend request this time 
Is $300 too much for a coat ? Not if you have a coat-fetish ! 
Anyone go to < PROPMALE > Gorge Batting Cages these days ? 
It's confirmed . I have A's in both my classes !

For His anger is but for a moment , His favor is for a lifetime ; Weeping may last for the night , But a shout of joy comes in the morning . -Psalm 30:5 
Being a Christian is a state of being not something you can strive for or work hard towards . Let God handle the transformation and just do your best not to get in the way . =) 
Nyquil Part II ! This time with a 100% dose =) 
The time for business as usual has ended 
FKPC cancelled service for tomorrow morning . I'd like it if Hope Church could have service even if it's late . Could it happen ? Please God ? =) 
at home but set to bolt out of here in the 4x4 Mazda Tribute if the power goes out =) 
Really didn't think < PROPFIRST > Yu-Na could get a 5 point lead on < PROPFEMALE > Asada after she did so well but it looks like she was holding back on us this whole time ! 
Just analyzed the scorecards for < PROPFIRST > Yu-Na and < PROPFEMALE > Asada . Both skated their programs cleanly but Yu-Na's Grades of Execution ( GOE ) scores were much higher especially on the jumps . 
( Follow up from yesterday ) Difference between < PROPFIRST > Yu-Na and < PROPFEMALE > Asada in the Free Skate 18.34 with 5.04 coming from difficulty of elements , 8.58 from GOE ( Grade of Execution ) , and 4.72 from artistry . A 100% solid win ! 
struggling with lack of motivation ..... 
just got rear ended a few hours ago . Was driving my dad's 2007 Sonata not my own car though .

Apparently feeling guilty is not something between you and yourself . Turns out that you can blame others for making you feel guilty and in the Asian world , that must be one of the highest crimes 
Final Fantasy XIII is on ! 
Don't give up so early on Final Fantasy XIII . It only gets better as you go along . 17 hours of play time logged on so far ..... I started about 34 hours ago O_O 
That Red Bull from before dinner is still keeping me awake ! 
perhaps some things in the past are supposed to be blotted out ..... 
Gold Medal hangover is real !

Just watched Shin-Soo Choo steal 2nd and then 3rd base 
Wow , I can't believe how caffeine high I am from drinking Pepsi < PROPMALE > . So much for getting the article summary ( due Monday ) done tonight . 
Piece of crap . Don't click on the secret gifts app . You do and it'll spread to your contact list 
Got an A in IFSM 300 ! =D Praise the Lord ! 
Lord , please give peace to my household . I promise I'll do my best to appreciate it =) 
Watched a PBS documentary on the housing crisis yesterday and in it was an argument between rational economists and behavioral economists . I figured it out just now . Only < PROPMALE > households can be truly rational . Everyone else would rather take the quick money . 
There's this app called F.B. HD Video Player that spams people with videos that say ______ , this is without doubt the hottest video ever ! :P :P :P Don't click on it ! 
Only YOU listen to our prayers God !

Orioles Bullpen = Scrub 
When's the Washington Wizards < PROPFIRST > Wall dance videos coming on YouTube ? 
It's not right to try to control people . If you want to control something , get an animal . 
i really wish i kept up with korean music better 
So it works out that the NBA Finals are a lot less appealing to me now and I actually have World Cup plans ! ? ? ? ?!!!! 
Don't remember when was the last time I came home to pre-sunrise light in the sky with birds chirping 
Pau , it looks like KG got his step back

Just waking up from 11 hours of post-Grace Retreat sleep ! 
Incredible game Dutch team ! 
Who will complete Lebron , < PROPMALE > , and Bosh in Miami ? And kudos to the Heat for going all out like that 
I want a song I heard in the IHOP-KC Prayer Room but I don't think it's able to be downloaded or purchased . All I can do is listen to it through the IHOP-KC Prayer Room video archives . 
I need to go to Kings Dominion as much as possible since I have a Platinum Pass now . I get free parking and free admission with a $25 discount for another person if you bring me =D 
I knew about the comparison between < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > but learning that there was a comparison between the same < PROPFIRST > and Judas Iscariot during last Sunday's sermon was really , really eye opening . There seems to be an emphasis on < PROPFIRST > , sister of < PROPFEMALE > even when I was at IHOP experiencing the Prayer Room . It was impossible to supplicate when the Spirit was leading us to a time of Adoration . 
2.2 GHz is not enough for Starcraft 2 . No fear , I've now overclocked it to 2.75 GHz ! 
Played the 7 Hour Demo of Starcraft 2 and now that it's over , I've payed $59.99 for the full version . Blizzard , I must say it's well deserved . 
Just grayed out on the Intimidator 305 
Cell phone clock has just adjusted itself for PST =) 
On the way back to socal from norcal . Tomorrow , back to the East Coast where < PROPFIRST > can complain about it again haha 
Didn't leave my house today

Kellen Winslow or < PROPMALE > Keller ? 
OS 4.1 is a huge improvement for the iPhone 3G ! 
There are 16 positions in my fantasy team including bench . I will have changed 9 of the team members by the end of the week .

I have a bad feeling about this 
iPhone 3G --> iPhone 4\

Chicken & Rice you shall be mine soon ! 
you ever get hungry but don't eat because you don't know what to eat ? 
I wish I could read collapsible outlines rather than these wordy paragraphs . It would be much easier to keep all this information organized 
wow , PBS is fantastic 
you ever dream about someone you haven't seen in a long time that you weren't thinking about ? 
Since the Redskins are 2-0 in the division , they will be in first place if the Cowboys beat the Giants . Redskins fans are now in the strange position of hoping the Cowboys win tonight . 
World Series Game 4 is sponsored by < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows . Do a lot of baseball fans like < PROPMALE > Potter ? Didn't know there was such market research going on . It's coming out November 19th . Who's going ? 
Wow look how close Fimian vs . Connolly is ! I wish I coulda voted in that one so if you had a vote in VA , I hope you used it ! 
watch out for ShoppyBag\ 
they send e-mails to all your contacts without your permission 
has anyone ever been able to get over a pet peeve ? what was that like ? 
I just realized that most of Facebook doesn't even know that South Korea fired back . The ROK military didn't just take it sitting down . If the DPRK really wanted war rather than attention , they wouldn't have stopped attacking . 
It's official ! I got A's in both my classes =) 
He said to them , \But who do you say that I am ? \ " < PROPFIRST > 16:15 " 
Shekinah < PROPFEMALE > come !!!

No power and the house is steadily getting colder and colder =( 
Power is back ! 
Mubarak releasing thugs against the protesters ? Seriously ? 
That's why the Redskins cut you 
Just set up my UMUC student e-mail account and joined Netflix . MLIA

Hackintosh !!!!! 
it takes enormous courage to be compassionate 
I just found out that I got 2 speeding camera tickets within 2 days = T one from < PROPFEMALE > and one from CP 
Just been really defensive lately ; not sure why 
Just bought a Phenom II x2 560 and an ASUS M4A89GTD PRO USB3 a few hours ago . So far I unlocked it to 4 cores ( from 2 ) and have the clock speed overclocked to 3888 MHz stable with possibility for more . I'm a happy geek right now . 
Go to your profile . The first five friends in the sidebar are your team for the Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \

Guys shouldn't be catty\ 
Seriously , what's up with catty guys ? 
I use an integrated chat program and when I set a common away message , it sets the away status for everything except Facebook chat . When FB chat stops being lame , I'll use it again . For now , look up my AIM or gchat on my profile if you don't have it already but if we've never IMed before , please tell me who you are when you IM me so I know you aren't a spammer . 
wow really Manny ? 
Buy Gas NOW ! Prices will spike this weekend . \ 
GasBuddy has noticed that price spikes hit the midwest first before coming here . Well the midwest has been spiking . 
There is no such thing as an app that will show who views your profile aka stalker apps . Stop falling for such things . Think about it , one of the reasons Xanga died was because of stalker apps . 
God bless ESPN3.com 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! 
But Jesus said to him , \Do not hinder him ; for he who is not against you is for you . \ " < PROPMALE > 9:50 http://bible.us/ < PROPMALE > 9.50 . NASB " 
I just realized I missed < PROPFIRST > Yu-Na's short program . She missed the triple toe in her triple lutz triple toe combo but got it back by turning her triple flip in to a triple flip triple toe combo . Heart of a champion ! 
On a boat ! 
A close second place but at least it wasn't second to < PROPFEMALE > Asada . Hope to see you competing full time next year < PROPFIRST > Yu-Na ! 
Obama will speak soon about Osama ! I'm glued to the tv right now 
They're saying it happened in Pakistan . I guess all that pissing them off was worth it in the end 
I'm thankful for JSOC's work but I find it scary if it becomes more powerful 
Stairs ! I feel like Kung Fu Panda =O 
Props and blessings to Ozzie the taxi driver . When we were talking about vacation destinations I mentioned I did most of my international traveling due to missions and he gave us the ride for free . He's looking to get in to Christian education . Believers looking out for each other !
