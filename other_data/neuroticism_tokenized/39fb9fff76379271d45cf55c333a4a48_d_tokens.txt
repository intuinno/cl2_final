Made it home to < PROPMALE > , just in time for Monday night football . 
I was in the pub yesterday when I suddenly realized I desperately needed to fart . The music was really , really loud , so I timed my farts with the beat . \

Then I suddenly remembered that I was listening to my iPod ...

I gotta share this recipe change with y'all . \ 
Fried Chicken- do all your marinating and batter mix they way you like it . Instead of dipping the Chicken in eggs , dip it in vanilla yogurt . I just tried it ... It was great\ 
All your regular flavors , with just a touch of sweetness to the batter .
