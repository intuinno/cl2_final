This week we remember all Babies born sleeping , babies carried but never met , those we have held but could not take home or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . In memory of our precious Angels ! 
I just read a post that said : < PROPFEMALE > , Snow White , and Sleeping Beauty are all gonna be pretty ticked when they find out they all married < PROPMALE > Charming ! \ 
Obviously the idiot who wrote that never watched Disney . Sleeping Beauty married < PROPMALE > Phillipe .
