Change is difficult but often essential to survival ... but eyes see what the mind wants ! 
Cause I'm leavin ' on a jet plane ( my Acura)\ 
Don't know when I'll be back again\ 
Oh Babe , I hate to go 
I have not been without a job since I was 16 ( without counting my summer jobs that started when I was 14 ) , so this feels different but I can get used to it ! Shopping here I come ! :) 
Survived my first day of work ! 
Just finished watching Paranormal Activity .... ehhh could have watched something better ! Oh well , good night now 
Having ur parents support through thick & thin is the greatest thing on earth . Thank u mami & daddy 4 ALWAYS being there for me/us . I will miss u a lot ! 
This is I LOVE MY SISTER WEEK ! If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you tight , watched you succeed , saw you fail , cheered you on and kept you strong , copy and paste this to your status . Sisters are a promise that we will have a friend forever ! Re-post if you have an amazing sister . 
< PROPMALE > has been watching \How to Train Your Dragon\ " since 4pm . Now he wants to see it while in bed ... thank goodness he has his own room ! No more dragons please ! " 
Reminiscing on life and being very appreciative of how far I have gotten and will continue to thrive ! Very hard to explain the feelings ... I better go to sleep now ! 
Me : \Damian go get ready for bed and then I will go upstairs to check on you\ " \ 
“God , < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change , the courage to change the things I can , and the wisdom to know the difference . ” 
I'm going to Cali tomorrow ! Yay !!! 
\Having the world's best idea will do you no good unless you act on it . People who want milk shouldn't sit on a stool in the middle of a field in hopes that a cow will back up to them . \ " --- < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > "

Me : Little Man , I love you so much ! \ 
Damian : I don't because it's night time\ 
Me : Huh ? Why ? \ 
Damian : Because I go to sleep and not feel that I love you . When I wake up , I love you because I think of you\ 
Me : LOL , well that makes sense ! Ok , Good Night Little Man ! 
Is asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour , if you or someone you know has or had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . ? Will you post it for just one hour ? Thanks ! 
Had a nice time @ the \Green Valley Office\ " with the CORE/HEART of IHS !!! " 
Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has , or has had , an invisible illness ( Diabetes , Crohns , PCOS , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Kidney Disease , Epilepsy , Fibromyalgia , MS , COPD , Lupus , Depression , Autism , ADHD asbestos etc ) . Do it for all who have an invisible illness . It's a daily struggle feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside ~ 
SIBLING WAR !!! Copy this if you are the best and smartest of your siblings . If this stands for one hour without one of your siblings protesting , it's so true . 
I loved you the minute I heard you were coming . I loved you the minute you were born ; then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ! 
Church Fart\ 
This says it all about getting older & the whole aging thing . \ 
An elderly couple is attending church services . \ 
About halfway through , she writes a note and hands it to her husband . \ 
It says , \ I just let out a silent fart 
Trying to keep my eyes open while working !!! Uhhhhh ! I need sleep !!!!!
