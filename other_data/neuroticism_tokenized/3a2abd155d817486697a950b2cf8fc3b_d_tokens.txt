has got a motivation problem , so my standard break from life is getting longer . 

is torn between looking forward to another drunken Saturday night and dreading another hungover Sunday morning . Standard dilemma in the life of < PROPFEMALE > . 
had no idea her iPod was so smart : north of < PROPMALE > it plays Alkaline Trio , the Dear & Departed , and the Ataris , and south of < PROPMALE > it plays T.I. and Akon . Well played , iPod ( quite literally ) . 
: salty , sweet , and drunk . 
got her ass smacked by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hosey in bed last Saturday night ... just so we're all clear . 
is on the el and just watched an extremely awkward , approximately 15 year old boy pull a disembodied < PROPFEMALE > leg out of his pants pocket . Not really sure why this is surprising , really . 
forgot her phone at home again today . Such a winner . 
just got to leave work early because the ceiling in her office caved in . Knew there was something wrong with today ... 
is wishing one of her favorite people , Miss < PROPFEMALE > Say , a very , very happy birthday . 
is now looking at 3 days off in a row and still has no feedback on this last thesis draft . No feedback = nothing productive to do . If I am a total waste of life between now and Thursday , I am blaming it entirely on Dr. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Tell all your friends . 
has only one thing to say : \Cubs fans are 90% scar tissue . \ " Sigh . So true . " 
was going to be really frustrated by the Cubs-Pirates game being on a ( no ) rain delay , but as it turns out , the Big Ten network is playing the Illinois-Indiana game from March 5th of 1989 . When one door closes , another opens ! :-) 
is thinking , FIVE Cubs homers in one game - including D . < PROPFIRST>'s career 300th - on the same night that the Blackhawks bring home the < PROPMALE > Cup ?! Finally , some evidence that God being a Chicago fan wasn't just a thing of the ' 90s . ;-) 
just realized that this is the last week of the first quarter century of her life . Ugh . 
is definitely watching < PROPMALE > Leary live , rubbing his nipples while he ridicules the Catholic church and Father's Day . Happy almost-birthday to me . 
is back from e-town , trying to make peace with the idea of being 25 . :-) Thanks to everyone for all the birthday wishes ! 
is thinking that a storm knocked out my superpowers , now I sleep through thundershowers - wake me when you learn to be cool . If I'm the captain of this boat , then all my shipmates are fools and all the stars in the world couldn't help me steer my way out of this kiddie pool .
