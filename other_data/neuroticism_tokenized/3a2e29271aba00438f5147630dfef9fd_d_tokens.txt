wants facebook to change her profile pic already ... 
is waiting impatiently for her M*A*S*H DVD box set ( birthday gift ) ;; 
they are fantastic live ? 
Just watched \Eraserhead\ " . \ 
I'm in Cape Cod and the ocean is only a few feet from the house |D 
All I want to do is upload my photos from Scotland , but Facebook won't permit me to make a new album :( I've just tried three times , and I get sent to the home < PROPFEMALE > after I click \create new album\ " . Ugh ! " 
I couldn't care less about < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim ; I am sorry :( 
I loathe films in 3-D . What happened to good old-fashioned awesome 2-D with affordable ticket prices and no glasses that make my head ache ? 
Ah . Did I miss something , or did FB change something about how you view photos here ? :S 
What is it with Facebook wanting me to vote on cachaça ? That and every other advert is asking me to move to Scotland or buy a dozen Welsh scones : x 
Haha , my updates are just a million automated messaged 6u9 I may as well never even log in
