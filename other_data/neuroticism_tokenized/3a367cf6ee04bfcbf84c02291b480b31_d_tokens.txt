Review for HBP : -Great score by < PROPMALE > Hooper and his incorporation of some of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>' themes for HP -Character development was key to this movie . The basic story line is there . I didn't expect the filmmakers to translate the 800-page book for

Welll , welll . Nice revenge , Bloomberg supporters . They booed and you booed back ! Congrats Bloomberg , deBlasio and Liu ! 
GOP Chair < PROPFIRST > Steele : Republican wins in VA and NJ are a referendum of Obama's performance . WHAT ? No way ! It's all politics . Can the Republican Party get any worse by attacking Democrats ? --> For me particularly : GOPs drafted a horrible Telecom Act of 1996 leading the FCC to redraft rules of net neutrality . 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > A . Brewer !

Fordham Fact of the Day : Fordham used to own most of land in the Bronx Zoo . Fordham sold it to the City for build a zoo in the late 1890s . Just imagine if Fordham had that land ...

So , technically , the fare only increased for the unlimited ( still a bargain $1.75 per ride from $1.45 ) and single ride tickets . Base fare remains $2.25 to some of those of you spreading false info about the fares . \

Who to blame : outlandish lawsuits against the MTA , Labor unions

Congrats to Bon Voyage Travel for winning THIRD PLACE ( first time ever reaching the Nationals & winning at Citywides ) . To the amazement/surprise of many , The Printing Depot failed to make the final rounds of Citywides , the first in the last eight ( and possibly the decade - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > an end of an < PROPFEMALE >?) years . Ov < PROPFEMALE > ll , a day of records , but that's the truth . Good job , BVT .

the Senate should move to confirm Bernanke this week ! This uncertainity has made the market jittery and can deter confidence in the American markets again . The Dow was down 5% last week . 
it looks like NY will not get a parade afterall . =\\ 
Avatar surpasses Titanic and LOTR ROTK . Do you think Avatar deserves all of the hype or did it arrive at the right time ? 
memory washed the computer and filled it with NON-MICROSOFT products , which include OpenOffice , Mozilla Thunderbird , etc 
doesn't want to review the notes for his classes . =\\ procrastinating .... 
time to get on the 4 from Fordham < PROPFEMALE > Hill . Let's see if the MTA can get me home ( in Brooklyn ) in 1 hr and 15 minutes . The IRT lines are the BEST -- fast , on time ! The BMT/IND ( lettered lines ) are slow ! 
is very VERY disappointed with President Obama's plan to cut funding to reach the < PROPFEMALE > and beyond . NASA was never assigned the task to explore Earth , but Space ! WE NEED TO BEAT THE CHINESE NOW AND NOT DECADES FROM NOW ! Going back to the < PROPFEMALE > and outer space will help re-ignite honest science and patriotism in the 1960s . 
it's called Lunar New Year , not \Chinese\ " New Year . Let's be fair to other Asians celebrating the < PROPFEMALE > cycle . " 
Snow Tuesday night into Wednesday afternoon ! Expect 12-24 inches between Philly and NYC . Don't fail again , Nor-easter ! Come on , bring it to NYC ! 
wow ! http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/02/10/nyregion/20100210-WORLDTRADE_index.html 
ahhh public school kids ! You were lucky to have a day off when conditions were technically not that bad . Oh , you have a whole week off next week . the DOE will not let you have a 12-day vacation , especially since HS started 1.5 weeks ago . More snow days equals a longer school year . And , yes , other cities have done it and NYC will not be any different . So stop whining . 
NYU undergraduate applications : 38,037 ( class of 2014 ) Fordham undergraduate applications : 27,377 ( class of 2014 ) Georgetown ( Fall 2008 stats ): 18,696 ( class of 2012 ) hmmmm ... some interesting < PROPFIRST > there .

Zoey But < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tarek Ghandour Zhen Huang Moe Sleem Sorry for being MIA recently -- soo unfair to you guys while I showed up almost every week for TPD . I promise to be at Deloitte on 3/12 . I have been realllllllllly busy . 
ewwwww Social Security Tax ... otherwise I would have gotten a return ! 
Some people need to understand that MTA workers ( especially the NYCT and Bus ) are under the TWU Local 100 Union . The raises were asked by the Union and if they are not granted , the leaders will call a strike soon , which will stop all subways and buses . Don't blame the management for this , ... 
WOW Congrats to another batch of NHS seniors and juniors inductees at FHHS ! ( good photos , J-Money Ye ) Surprising that they kept almost everything from the 04-05 E-Board , logistics of the auditorium , the programs , etc . Being a bit bored and avoiding my studies , I went back in time to my Gmail in 2005 ( < PROPFEMALE > Cheng , VP ) .... wow ! I still can't believe nearly five years went by . 
I HATE WINDOWS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Update this , update that ! error this , error that ! 
< PROPFIRST > Toulouse hmmm .... Could be true ? But this study might only be true if we keep all else constant ( certeris paribus ) . Nonetheless , a plausible study . I think Thompson didn't run a strong enough campaign .

UP's first song is very touching . I hope they get it ! UPDATE : AND I WAS RIGHT ! 
avatar loses best picture . a good thing ! 
overall oscars 2010 for 2009 movies .... ehh . There were better films . The wider net for 10 films for best picture didn't allow for better competition either . 
The 1 train and 4 train rules ! From Times Square to 191 St , 20 minutes on the 1 . From Fordham Rd to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn , 55 minutes on the 4 . The MTA can do amazing things when it's normal . Kudos Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA )

I know I will get negative responses for saying this ... but I've been noticing a trend over the last year with newborns on my news feed . am i to suspect that some elementary and middle school classmates are having babies at the age of 22/23 ? it just feels weird seeing them on the feed .

Zoey But < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tarek Ghandour < PROPMALE > Bermeo Zhen Huang Moe Sleem FYI Pres . Obama might be reading for a teleprompter , but it's useful to take a lot at his hand gestures and his emphasis on words . That's key for the business plan competition -- highlighting the keywords and emphasis .

I'm arguing that history has a place for polytheism . of course , he's winning with the bible stuff , which I put aside as a resource of debate . sigh ... religious wars start this way ....

I'm done with college , yes . But look at this course at Fordham over the summer : Anthropology of J.R.R. Tolkien . Looks fasinating compared to my LOTR and Philosophy course I took three years ago . 
Sitting in the Second Floor lounge listening the Lord of the Rings soundtrack is amazing . In my four years at Fordham LC , I've never spent such a relaxful time at the Lounge -- stress-free ! Waiting for the Spring 2010 screening of the Dr. T's class videos ! 
I really don't like it when my parents reluctantly say yes and give a long lecture on the negative side making my sister all guilty about it ... some thing as simple a SSN for collegeboard . Gosh ... paper apps are disappearing . Of course , they tell me that I'm wrong to allow my sis to apply . sigh . some times you wonder how to respectfully disagree with them .

So many pictures from FCLC's diploma ceremony ! =) Congrats everyone ! You're looking amazing , alumni ! ( I hope they keep the diploma cermony on Walsh ; I personally don't like Martyr's Lawn ) 
Smoking should be banned from parks , too . Or just have a section for themselves They're everywhere ... why did I have suffer your fate ? 
He will be working for OpenPlans this summer . Mondays-Thursdays , about 35 or so hrs , $6000 for ten weeks , unlimited MetroCard and trips to the beach . Sounds like fun , but it will entail work on government transparency , cost-benefit analysis on open data , urban planning , and others . I'm declining the MTA , because they're taking a bit long with a response . 
Argh , blackberry ! I can't wait to get rid of you ! Why is RIM's mail service down ? It has been going on for some eight hours ! Unacceptable ! 
T-8 days to the Comprehensive Exam ! 
thanks , Fordham . Tell me at the last minute that I am missing < PROPFEMALE > documents in which I handed in nearly TWO months ago . their fault , not mine ... and yet I have to do the extra work . grrrrr 
argh procrastination at its best . I can't seem to get myself for the Econ Comprehensive Exam ... at least not intensely !

Oh well . In all sense of fairness , the refs at the game are a bit biased for the entire tournament . And they say we're merciless and rude , Americans are not aggressive enough at the FIFA games by trying to play fair .

24.5% of my paycheck goes to taxes . >_< 
No wonder people subscribe to Amtrak over the buses . Trains in most cases are on time and not subject to 1960s highways . Come on , < PROPFEMALE > build a cost effective hi-speed railroad system . 
This is only my opinion , but I think I found another system that's worse than MTA/NYCT ... the DC Metro . Train breakdowns and longer dwell times ( at least longer than NYCTs ) . And paying by distance .... I'm spoiled by NYC . 
@emwatson < PROPMALE > Potter actress < PROPFEMALE > Watson ( Hermione Granger ) has officially joined Twitterverse :) 
sigh Unions need to stop demanding so much . the TWU Local 100 ( aka workers ' union for the MTA ) are really hitting the MTA asking for raises and better pensions when the rest of the economy is cutting back . So when the MTA ( not the Union , mind you ) goes for hikes , blame the good ol ' Union . The Unions run the system while the MTA only manages it . 
Is it already Thursday ?! 
Is confused 
tonight's a perfect night IF I weren't in the city , if it were cooler , and if I were alone with maybe on more person under a perfectly bright < PROPFEMALE > . Argh I hate this humid weather . Why can't it be 60s with clear nights/bright sunshine every day ? 
If the MTA were to implement a fare program , where you pay by distance and once you exit the system ( DC and London ) , would you support it ? All thoughts welcome .

For those of you planning to attend the Colbert/Stewart rally on Saturday at the National Mall .

Freezing ! 
According to WMATA , a whooping , 825,437 riders used the Metro to attend the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in DC , beating the old of 716K from 1991 . Surprisingly , the Metro system didn't even run enough trains for this event . This would not have happened in NYC . Anyways , there must be at 1.2 - 1.5 million at the rally then ! AMAZING !

This is precisely why I made my status yesterday . People on twitter and facebook are cursing the NYCT/MTA ops during a 21-inch snow storm . Can you operate a train with the third rail covered ? Do you know what will happen to the train ( think of an investment lost) ? the safety of the passengers ? The stranded passengers on the outside platforms can attest to that . Stay home or don't complain . 
TO NYers with CARS :\ 
Notification issued 12/27/10 at 3:00 PM . The New York City Department of Transportation , in conjunction with the Department of Sanitation , has suspended Alternate Side Parking Regulations and Parking Meter Regulations Citywide for Tuesday , December 28 , 2010 to facilitate snow removal . 
MID-MORNING UPDATE FOR COMMUTERS :\ 
NYCT service restored on the 5 Dyre Avem A to the Rockaways ; Shuttle service remains suspended , C , D , F , G . BRIGHTON ( B/Q ) and SEA BEACH ( N ) are suspended . \ 
Buses are not running ( or on limited service ) because Sanitation has failed to clear the bus lanes . MTA Chief < PROPFIRST > Walder is calling this two days of OOS to be unacceptable . Hopefully , Sanitation picks up the pace . 
See what I mean , commuters ! Now you're forcing service to return , and we're getting trouble :\ 
\Due to smoldering cables 
It looks like I can go home after all . Sea Beach ( N ) is back , as I anticipated .... 3 days later . I'm not counting Sunday . 
Almost back in NYC ... but why is the skyline so dim tonight ? Usually I can see it on Turnpike . 
One thing I do not miss from NYC -- 8th Avenue . Slow people and the cacophony . A young woman with a pair of Uggs and capable legs decided to slow down walking the streets outside the station . There's only a small pathway , but I sped ahead and bumped into her . Too bad lady . This is not the land of the red carpet . Get moving . 
hahhaha NJ Gov < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > tie said that his family comes before the people of New Jersey . Surprise , surprise ! At least Bloomberg was in the City during the snowstorm . 
Just paid another big chunk of my savings to loans . sigh 
The heaviest snow band of the morning is now set up right across the NYC metro . Snowfall rates up to two inches per hour . Visibility in midtown Manhattan is only several blocks right now . 
All MTA services continue to run normally and we expect to run normal service throughout the evening and this weekend . Snow-fighting equipment will still remain at the ready to keep rails free of ice and snow until the storm completely subsides . 
\More wintry weather on tap tomorrow from DC to NYC as well as the southeast ! Then all eyes are on a potential < PROPMALE > snowstorm for the mid-Atlantic and northeast Tuesday-Wednesday next week . The Northeast Quadrant is monitoring the possibilities \"" 
Go figure ! Waited all day to make a final forecast , just to watch factors coming into play that would cause the developing coastal storm to explode later and further east . Still significant snows , but less south and west , less in the immediate NYC metro , and more along eastern Long Island up through Rhode Island and Massachusetts . Stay tuned ... 
6PM : Mayor Bloomberg has issued a snow emergency for the City of New York . Stay off the roads and don't block the plows . If you do , it will cause more problems . I assume NYCT is on Plan 4 to ensure trains/buses are running on or close to modified schedules ; expect some local service due to trains stored in tunnels .

The decision whether to close the city’s public schools on Wednesday will be made at 5 am . 
NYC public schools are open . 
So I became a Taurus from a being a Gemini for over 23 years , 8 months and 14 days . Well , at least I'm still a rabbit in the lunar Chinese calendar . 
CONGRATS to TPD and BVT ! TPD wins 2nd and BVT 3rd tied with VE Law ( New Dorp ) . I suspect VEMI ( New Dorp ) was 1st . Nonetheless , we have two teams from Fort Hamilton AND New Dorp competing at the Nationals . AMAZING ! \

For those of you planning to head out into the City ( NYC ) tomorrow ( Monday 1.17 ): \ 
NYCT and SI Railway are operating NORMAL WEEKDAY schedules , \ 
MNRR , LIRR and some bus lines ( especially those operating out of Staten Island ) have modified schedules to reflect the service levels . Please consult mta.info to plan your trips . 
' The Social Network ' will fall when it comes to the Academy . True Grit , Inception , The < PROPMALE>'s Speech and Black Swan deserve more credit . 
Some thing weird is going on with this decision to sell Facebook shares to only foreigners . \

Time does go by fast . I can't believe some of the OLs and students I helped are in the final semester at Fordham < PROPMALE > Center . Good luck everyone ! 
>_< Just got into work to be told that we have a 2-hr delayed start . sigh 
If given the opportunity , I would want to manage the NYCT portion of the MTA . Reduce contractors , more in-house work and real productivity . It would be nice to have someone that wants the system to improve and use the subway/buses ( despite that I'm in DC right now ) . Technology , labor , and capital must all work together . 
Oh great ! Here comes the big battle ! NYT ( 17:55 ): \House Votes to Repeal Health Care Law \"" 
House Republicans pass < PROPMALE > to cut 32 million Americans off health insurance and increase the federal deficit . #P2 #TCOT #HCR 
Very interesting couple of days on the MTA NYCT lines . Plenty of sick passengers and people on tracks compared to the usual signal and train malfunctions . Do we have people trying to get commuters more frustrated on the MTA by CREATING UNNECESSARY nuisances ? 
Gosh , graduate school is making me poor . These < PROPFEMALE > repayment folks are driving me nuts ! Why can't my savings have more interest ( 1%) while my < PROPFEMALE > is 6.9% ? =( 
NYCT : D , N and R trains running NORMAL service this weekend . Track work cancelled due to extremely low temperatures . 
Gosh , I hate single tracking on DC Metro . It's worse than re-routes in NYC ( for those that think the MTA/NYCT is the only system out with bad service ) 
WMATA , I rather you run in two sections than single track . Blue/Orange are a mess . 45 minutes to move through four stations ? 
\The < PROPMALE>'s Speech\ " was excellent . It definitely deserves an < PROPFIRST >." 
I think the Jets are losing . Just close the TVs . 
Curiously enough , according to record keepers , NYC/Boston/DC/Phil are having their coldest winter since 2008 , which includes wind chill . So , it's probably not the coldest yet . I think we've had colder trends in high school . I remember it was -20 F on a Saturday morning for the SAT Subject exams and the temps didn't rebound until a week later . No doubts , it's COLD , but I would prefer to be in the NE than FL or CA . 
Watching the State of the Union . 
Obama : \We do big things . \ 
UPDATED SNOW FORECAST by tomorrow morning :\ 
UPDATED SNOWFALL FORECAST ( not much deviation from last night ): DC/Baltimore/DelMarVa/Southern coastal NJ/Twin Forks Long Island/Cape Cod and Islands = 4-8\ ; Philly/Interior So . NJ = 6-12\ " ; Central NJ/North NJ/NYC metro = 8-14\ " ; Southern New England inc . Boston metro = 10-16 \"" 
FORDHAM STUDENTS :\ 
TODAY : after 4PM classes cancelled at RH , > 6 PM LC\ 
TOMORROW : earlier than 11 AM classes cancelled at RH , < 10 AM at LC . 
A reminder for NYCT , MNRR and LIRR riders :\

LIRR : Reduced service tomorrow morning ; cancellation of 14 of the 143 westbound AM scheduled trains . \ 
MNRR : Normal service . \ 
Check mta.info or @nyctsubwayscoop for more details . 
All above ground service running delays or suspended on NYCT MTA . Check @nyctsubwayscoop or MTA.info . ALL bus service cancelled . 
D and F trains are running . N/Q service remains out . all tunnel service running . the MTA deserves a < PROPFIRST > on the back for this . 
All Coney Island trains restored . D F N Q trains are running their normal routes with delays . Budget extra time . thanks . for the quick work MTA . 
Official snow amount : 19\ . Close to last time and most of MTA NYCT is up and running with a few hours compared N out for three days . GOOD JOB ! " 
All MTA service on the rails are running , but with delays . Follow @nyctsubwayscoop or @nyctrains . 
AFTERNOON TRANSIT UPDATE :\ 
The subway system is operating at near normal levels , with service restored on all lines . SIRTOA is operating limited service between Tottenville and St. < PROPFIRST > . 
Congrats to \The < PROPMALE>'s Speech \"" 
Don't think about elephants . 
The National Weather Service is calling 3-6 inches of snow for NYC with some freezing rain . The Bronx and north and west and will receive more . 
DELAYED OPENING AT FORDHAM < PROPMALE > CENTER TOMORROW . 10 AM REPORT TIME . 
LUNAR New Year , guys . Respect those in Vietnam , Japan , Korea and other Asian countries celebrating this holiday , not just the Chinese . 
Just did some trig identities and singing of derivatives for my sister's homework -- only a math < PROPMALE > would do this . :) 
Enroute to Washington DC via 145 NE Regional Amtrak . Definitely paying for the price of comfort when you pay early and a member of the Club . 
wooo ! I just rooted my HTC Droid Incredible ! No more storage problems ... and it works better than an iPhone 
It feels like Spring this morning . I guess < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > were right about it . DC is going to reach 51 degrees F . 
Don't get me wrong , but this excitement for the VZW iPhone 4 is overblown . A rooted Android ( or simply Android)phone can beat the iPhone in flexibility . Droids will be more valuable than the iPhone when the market shifts ( think supply and demand ) . Development caliber is also different . The Android community is about sharing and improvements , not profits ; this Apple AppsStore is only about dollars , not true innovation . 
Wait for three packed trains during rush ? Only in WMATA , not the MTA NYCT . 
< PROPFIRST > Lennon - Imagine 
Third day in a row on a crowded Blue line train ... feels like the Lex line in NYC . At least the MTA announced service cuts .

\What do you think President Hu Jintao of < PROPFEMALE > is thinking right now as he watches TV images of Tahrir Square ?

\LEAVE ! LEAVE ! LEAVE ! \ " cried the people of Egypt . Another sad day for reform . " 
I'm loving BBC World News Service . 
Mubarak resigns and steps down ! The Armed Forces are now in power . 
Jubilation in Tahrir Square as #Mubarak resigns and Supreme Military reigns . Democracy triumphs . The cheering on the square sounds beautiful !

Errr 70 degrees in DC on Friday ? >_< 
A bit late , but why are people this angry about < PROPFIRST > Bieber losing an award ? This is about singing , not his hear t-t hrobbing personality . 
Yes , I officially only owe $52K instead of $77K from undergrad/grad school after consolidating . Citi thinks I didn't catch their mistake ! Thanks to the Dept . of < PROPMALE > for correcting the final amount .

Gosh , I'm hungry ! 
What ? It's going to reach 68 degrees in DC today ? 
Feels like he just acquired his dad's cooking . I just made perfect salmon and fried rice ( separate dishes ) for dinner and tomorrow lunch . =) 
I'm sitting next to a very talkative girl on the bus . Annoying . 
Wait , DC is getting 2.5 inches of snow by tomorrow morning ? I thought it was spring already ? It was 72 this past Friday !

Probably company PCs RT @cap_transport : Fascinating data visualization session at #transpo . Equally fascinating to see 10 Apple laptops to 3 PC's . 
Check out http://bit.ly/9BpHmC on the potential flaws of visualization #transpo . How do we need to communicate the message to each constituency ?

With the exception of Acela Express , Amtrak's NE Regional from DC to Boston costs $70 ( still cheap ) to Boltbus's $40 with the same timing . Quite interesting . 
One of the key takeaways from #transpo camp RT @The_IILP : Resurfacing 1 mile of blacktop = $1.5 M , but public transit costs too much ?! #transpo 
Probably had one of the most best commutes this morning : N via Broadway Express ( not the usual local ) and early on the schedule ; Amtrak to DC on time and early . 
ahhh iPad 2 
Reorganizations in the office is always fun ! 
I'm beginning to notice the FCLC Class of 2011 grad school statuses . It makes feel like I should start looking into MPA and/or PhD programs . I need to keep up . But first , I have to payoff at least quarter of my loans . If all goes well , I'll be back in school by Sept . 2012 .
