kindergarten , when i was living on the airforce base ... i was a mean kid . beating on the other kids and my family ... had to repeat kindergarten because of my behaviour . but what really pops out was this one girl . white hair , white skin , and bright blue eyes . she was sick , puking in class , fainting , going to the nurse repeatedly ... i didn't feel sorry for her ... but i did my best to make her smile ... 
And if I was a window , I'd show you , when you look through me , the world that I see ... 
i'm the deep breath before you say fuck the rest , the smirk as you watch the coincidences work , that snicker when your mind goes to the gutter , and that mad laugh when you look at the past , inspecting all those good moments and wondering why they didn't last 
wanting to yell to the heavens all these questions that ramble my mind for discussion about life and it's endless lessons . 
it's called a snuke ... lol ... 
* OhDoctor , WhatAboutYourFriends*They'reFine . They'llAlways be fine * 
i wish my sun would come out to play , like i remembered in my younger days . how it layed on the horizon , till the days it darkened . 
* he glides his hand over the flame and grinds his finger tips together , feeling the soot fill his finger prints . * beginnings ... endings ... no ... there is only change ... 
* he pulls out a knife and sticks it in the middle , of an outer edge , of a table * it is , without saying , that reality is a whole ... * drags the blade towards himself , cutting a line * of parts ... 
the flaming touch your soul'll snuff with the freezing rain , your essence , does bring ... 
satanists needing you to keep their church litter free ... and told not to park in front of the building across the street ... they'll tow your car ... burning the midnight oil with a different kind of termoil , that i am ... 
* he rolls a black die across the floor * any answer is a path ... * the die lands , four up * but not all of you is walking that path ... * rolls again , and lands a two * and you can't always agree with it ... 
It's the thought of my last breathe , and how , at my funeral , they'll cry , that brings up how I'll meet death , and I'll never let them know my suicide ... 
* he looks to the sky , staring through the stars in the midnight hour * ya know , if the sun < PROPFEMALE > right now , people would be amazed and awwed at such a miracle . but because they didn't understand it , they'd also be scared shitless ... 
ren and stimpy mother fuckers ! 
staging some waiting game for fame with a contraption or two , an inception of new to break this world of reality , just to get a ... girl mad at me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > ... i sometimes question my sanity ... 
i show you something fantastic , and you find fault in it 
Computer's out for the time , been crashin ' , stupid snes roms ... 
Long and busy work days irritate me , but the pay checks satisfy me ... What a cunundrum ... 
Everything I told you would happen , did . You say I'm to blame , calling me pathetic , when it was you who lied when you said you loved me . I'm sorry you don't know yourself , nor any better . I just wish you'd try to understand 
I've got something to say , but the words won't come out and play this game ... 
Heavy rain fall , arms held out , feeling the sensation of a cold static beating into his bones ... 
Don't you feel it in the back of your head , troubling your mind . Does one have to be dead when they've run out of time ? 
We were once all part of what once was a start to the planets and stars 
* What did he do ? *he ate half a razor blade ... * wait , what ? *he put a razor in his mouth and chewed it , handed half of it back and swallowed the rest ... * \I realize sometimes I don't have much self preservation ... \"" 
* i snap the knife's tip off in the table and sneer at them from across the table * your gonna have to learn the rules here . If I gotta put up with your shit , you have to put up with mine . Got it ? 
A burst of light ? Tons of lights ... A transformation built from the union of positive and negative ... But to what end ? 
The gospel of judas ... Is it heresy , or the one truth that made the world what it is today ? 
Coding ... It's in language , genetics , energy waves , matter , cause , and effect ... But what made these code ... 
Has it occured to anyone else that the answers to life can't be unbderstood by the sane ... 
I have this hint for the heaven sent , let them live life an ' be hell bent . If you breath , as you say you believe , they're well on their way to hell , an ' no matter what , your going up 
You , there , hidden in the shadows , sittin ' around , stalking where the he < PROPMALE > goes . Have you seen what it means to dream ? Do you know the point of a soul ? Is the he < PROPMALE > what your < PROPMALE > shows ? 
An eclipse huh ? Of the lunar sort ? Around when ... I'll be watching ... 
i once read a book that took a bit to learn the literature because , for sure , it was written for the soul in a language one couldn't know ... 
* he palms his face , inhaling the mace * an ' no matter how hard i try , it'll never be like the first time when the pain bit in deep and convinced me to keep some sence of sanity towards humanity ... 
well hell , i couldn't tell the pact would enact with the setting of the sun , from the inside , just for fun ... 
i heard you lost your sanity as you were being born , but facing up to humanity is nothing to be scorned . i just wish you luck an ' that such , along with a broken heart when we depart ... 
it helps to notice that dreams are unfocused . an ' at the end of the night , they'll leave without a fight . 
11:12 am .... man am i hungry ... shouldn't have let christmas stretch my stomach ... 
plates of ice kissing the windshield ... 
what is < PROPFIRST > up to today ? well i'm not sure , so i couldn't say . but what i do know , i'd have to show ya . 
popable parts : neck , shoulders , collarbones , elbows , wrists , two knuckles on each finger , thumbs backwards and forwards , palms , spine , sternum , hips , knees , ankles , big toes ... 
oh come on , good sir . it's all there if you listen ... jus ' turn down the lights , an ' breath it all in ... 
sometimes i'm not quite sure what i'm doing , but i'm doing something 
it's not that i don't know my goals , but that the trail to my destination is o'plenty 
i've got this weight , that won't relocate to some central of mind , an ' leave me with time 
i came to some conjecture , that lead me to some lecture about some space an ' time , an ' what's me an ' mine ... 
come on kid , you're not crazy . you've just forgotten how to comprehend yourself over these centuries . how to understand what exactly you are ... and it has left you with this fear ... buried too deep in your soul for you to know , but only feel ... 
sometimes i feel unsafe for you humans ... 
lol it ain't official ' til facebook says so 
i had never been another beginning bend on the life you've spent filling in for the soul an ' shell you were given . but i'd place the mace , before you had to face , what enemy you couldn't debate . after the fact , you'll never turn back ... 
what do i wanna do ... i wanna eat ... hmmm ... but there's got to be something else ... 
why deprive yourself from the life , even if it just gives you something to gripe about . think , you could never have found out . 
exodus 34:13 
and it was for a second , with a smirk , that i understood everything . life , love , existance to it's very core . but in the next second i found myself frowning with a mind full of questions . madness sucks ... 
a hurricane of beasts hell couldn't control and heaven was too afraid to touch . who here understands the bore that was made of the world when left to human hands !? who knows what it could have been when we held it again ... 
BORED OUT OF MY GOD DAMNED MIND !!! you , pass me the baton . you bring me that tortch . what we're going to do here is light this bitch afire just to see how high those flames will dance . and if your willing to stand with me , we'll dance with them on the roof top . 
this responsable stuff is driving me insane ... why can't i cover everything in flames ? if i can't break into it , i'll break through it . and if < PROPFEMALE > comes on too soon , inll leave everything with a boom 
riding the bus home , lost in some musical zone , and i can't help to think to myself that i may have drinkin ' to much at the bar . well , so far i'm doing well , and only time will tell lol 
been a few weeks since i been home ... looks kinda empty ... might have to paint the walls with pain ... an agony of mohogany ... or a trace of doom with maroon ... but with a crimson of what leaks in . 
some days i have to actually ask myself what the fuck i'm doing . and the only answer i give back is a crooked smile , and ' whatever the fuck i want to . ' 
he spins his pen through his finger tips and just for shit he lights a fire to the gunpowder wire he's wound around his neck and chest , and only laughs 
note to self , sunrise bagel and espresso down cushman will be spared when i set fire to this town . in return for free coffee and food of course . 
at first i thought it was weird she didn't know how to make balloon animals . than i had to ask myself why i know how to 
' don't trust none of these people , won't give'em enought to love me for me so even when they welcome me into their kingdom , can't bring self to believe them . '

* he removes her blindfold and points down the < PROPMALE > side * it is a far way down a < PROPMALE > wall to the crashing waves . but that , my love , is our future ... 
it wasn't the placement of the faceless , but how they made me feel graceless . they banded together with one another and simply stole my breakfast ... 
and if it was i who was chosen to die , i'd take it all in , and i'd take it with pride . i'd hold all your pain , and the sorrow you've gained . and as i burned in hell , it'd burn as well ... 
* what are you doing there ? *a li'l somethin ' somethin ' with ductape and gunpowder . * explosives ? i don't think that's smart of you ... * actually , it's for a fuse . and it's much smarter than standing on the explosive , so could you please move to the left about three feet ? thanx . * 
humanity's li'l cavalry steppin ' forth to show my worth with those i take down as i'm buried in the ground under the roses of those who know how my last breath has laid me to rest ... 
i like to leave my < PROPFIRST > on the moment , in hopes to spark some component that glitters in the back of your eyes and a quitter let's your soul arise ... 
the defacement of the populace ... was that the arrangement i had placed with the lonely devil for my only unleveled soul ? does it know the mess it will digest ? or how my corruption will devour the eruption it cowars from ? 
' woke up , got up near 11 o'clock , butt naked except i was wearin ' my socks , and that's kewl , ' cause most the time this floor is cold . stand up to stretch , and look for my soul ... ' 
i'm like a rubiks cube without no use ' cause the color of the stickers had been removed . with the others whose wishes had been abused , we're like a throwing stone to give back to you ... 
* i smile slightly and slowly shake my head as i check my messages * goodbye ... and thank you ... 
do you believe the sunrise doesn't see the fight you breath in at day , and durring the night ? 
i am the sweat to your stress , the furrowing of your brow . i am the small smile to good unexpectations , and the sneer to bad expectations . i am the devil and angel that lay upon your shoulders . i am good and evil , but neither ... in the beginning i am but a reaction , and later i am but a choice ... choose wisely i say ... but life can't be wise if you don't learn from your mistakes ... 
pattern ... currents in the sea of chaos ... the ebb and flow always onwards ... feeding upon and unto itself ... of all that exists , and yet nothing can ... it is as it is because there is nothing more ... and it isn't as it isn't because it can not be ... where all coincides , and nothing can be ... to look upon it from the shore is to see all that was , is , and could ever be ... but to swim ... would be but a fool's dream ... 
remind me why the passion of life has somewhat died , and i'll show you the burning inside , what i've held to hide what may disturb your life , and push you from what comforts you have left ... 
it was your jelousy , the constant need for insecurities , that i took , burned , and inhaled into me , but the sacrifice felt like dynamite as it burst through my chest . so as the table turned , what we had was laid to rest ... 
i didn't want your thank yous , sorrys , or help . i wanted your insecurities , sorrows , worries , and pain . and to leave you there , broken , with a smile on your face . all i needed was there , but what i wanted stood in the way ... 
my mind ... the limited time i have to be the spaz i used to be as a kid before i got into this doing what i'm told and being bent into the fold only meant to purpetuate the society i hate 
that when i die , i'll be leaving nothing behind that won't be forgotten or destroyed ... that my hell will be just a window i can't look away from , as i'm forced to watch it all fall apart ... and when i come back , i won't know what i'm looking at ... 
k : am i doing something wrong ? m : what do you mean ? k : he's always got this sad look in his eyes ... m : he's always had thatk : do you know why ? m : i asked , but he wouldn't tell me ... 
why is it you can save a congress women , and be called a hero nation wide , but if you do the same for an everyday person , your just being a citizen ? 
has any one ever noticed how people are so focused on the very flaws that make them odd enough to stand on the edge of the insanity these people keep handing me witheach wishful woe that they keep in their soul ? or may i just say that perfection today is a < PROPMALE > bucket that keeps us just saying \FUCK IT ! \"" 
so i'm lighting this cigarette , wondering why it won't take me back to those time back home , with that childish tone , when i had no care of the when , how , or fear of what was to come , but i've already come undone ... 
g'night , and travel well , my li'l hell ... give the fight that makes them hide from your existance , your very sight , and live in their ignorance , their very life ... i wish you well , my li'l hell ... 
i watch them all , with stars in their eyes , waiting to fall and catch all the lies that spread through their he < PROPMALE > , their body , their soul ... with the < PROPMALE > , the shady , and those that dispose of the could , and maybe , with the life that they chose . but here i am , with the clutch in my hand , wondering the dynamics and the place , that i , stand 
* looks out the window * that ... is amazingly horrifying ... and awesomely degrading ... this may suck a little ... 
lol those of you who think you know what you're doing are getting in the way of us who do know what we're doing 
he slowly shakes his head and shows a light smirk . \sometimes i wish you could see it ... other times i'm not sure you'd know what you were looking at ... \"" 
he leans back , arching his spine along the tree trunk's roots , resting his head in his hands . he closes his eyes and smiles a bit as he taps his foot to some unheard music 
a conglomuration of memories , emotions , whimsical thoughts , depressing feelings , and the many voices just trying to be heard 
my sanity ? oh i'm quite sane dear . mad , maybe . the stability of my mind has been questioned by just about everyone who's ever talked to me . and their answers have ranged from weird to stark raving mad . but no , i'm not insane 
it comes and goes , but sometimes i think something unseen is trying to talk to me ... like thousands of voices trying to relay a message ... are they dead ? are they alive ? i don't know ... i've only heard them coalesce into one , once ... 
i ... hadn't thought through the power of words ... poison , or healing ... but i'm careless ... or i hope you'll understand what thoughts pass through my mind , and i believe you're strong enough to process them ... 
kid , you're just an unstable coward , who thinks way too highly of your punk ass . so why don't you close your eyes , take a deep breathe , and jump off a < PROPMALE > . 
anger management for 6 years ... kindergarten to 5 grade ... so if i calmly , and coldly , tell you something , please take it into consideration before i rip your head off with my nails and chains , k ? 
blood , man ... or damage ... some kind of destruction of property or person ... but instead i sit at the bar and chill with a beer ... the latter is unhealthy for me , but the first is dangerous ... dammit ... this thought process only makes me want more harm ... 
i'm thinking that the modern day has made everyday life almost , if not completely , meaningless ... this idea just pisses me off ... and the urge to destroy most the population pops it's ugly head again ... 
and ya know , i could have been a < PROPFEMALE > . yet here i am , sittin ' with my soul , chillin ' at the bar , wondering how far they've flown before i could < PROPFEMALE > t this plight that some call life 
he drops his shine to find the crop of the eloquence they've spent dropping since the beginning of time ... 
eh i can't be around thee when the sun shines the sea to the extention of affection ... i'm drunk ... 
someone , come on , face me in the street so we can repeat what had been at some time again that once was just because 
hi , my name is < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > cox , and i am a cheap druggie ... also known as an addict . i don't take over the counter drugs , but i smoke , drink , and adore caffiene ... my past was not as simple ... but i've kept away from those things since , and yet i still feel ... empty ? lost ? something ... it is a boring life ... 
no ... i've never let any one all the way in ... i've seen some try . oh god , did they try . but these walls are made of madness . and what i hold inside is much worse ... maybe i should be worried , maybe there is a way to stop it . but if the proffesionals can't help me , who else can ? 
imagine a place of inconceivable light , and no shade , mixed with a place of inconceivable darkness , and with no shadows .... now , in this , and any , time , there is a place of darkness where the light only shines on that you know , because it is where nothing , and all , exist ... the only other wonder is the sea of chaos with it's currents of pattern .... oh the wonders of existance through eyes that see too far ... 
lol robots are the cheapest of family friends 
life ... is about living ... it's that simple ..... but i was never taught how to do that ... 
i am but a home to those who hold the broken in their heart ... something about the farce of life ... 
not a victim ? figure it out and kill the bitch in me 
wasn't the point to stop ? has it not been put into enough perspective for you ? your bleeding yourself to death , and it's not doing anyone any good . 3 days sober , 4 cig's , and you kill it in one night with a whole bottle and pack . you disapoint me ... 
she lays her hand upon his cheek , smiling . it lights up her eyes like the sun peaking through cracked ice . \you are such a beautiful creature ... i just wish you would see that ... \"" 
he walks into the kitchen , to her making salsa . something in her stance feels wrong , but he doesn't know what it is . as she turns around , he can see it in her eyes . he doesn't know the word for it , but pain . he opens his arms and clutches her . \that's what i love about you ... you always know when something's wrong ... \"" 
* it means i believe i'm an illusion . * am i an illusion ? *oh i think your quite real . * will i become an illsion ? *lol either that , or i'll become real . * 
come back to me , oh sun of the free . bring back to me that which resembles peace . and show the growing breed beyond god , the devil , and me . 
* tilts head * confidence man , it does much for the soul and those around you 
is it who you are , or what you are , that makes the person you are ? 
i am ... but a figment of your imagination ... for anything you've seen me be is nothing compared to what i have been . and i do hope you see it ... i wish i did ... 
he tightly rolls up a dollar < PROPMALE > , sticks the tip in his mouth , and lights it like a cigarette . he starts coughing uncontrollably as he's extinguishing the dollar . after he's finaly gained control of his breathing , he stares at the charred < PROPMALE > with an eyebrow raised and wide eyes . he turns to you and licks his lips . \you think a 20 would taste better ? \"" 
ya know ... i can tell that i'm bored when i just keep doing these share things ... 
7 weeks , to about 3 years ... time passes differently with different subjects ... 
one should never just take things as they are given . question it all . because if you don't ask , how will you know ? 
i've a thought that the cost of life is the gripe we set forth , finding the net worth of what's around us , ' til someone's found us ... 
adorable , is a word that's haunted me most my life . so is intimidating ... 
he tilts his head back and laughs to the sky . upon recollection of this moment , he wanders what he was laughing at , and why he can't remember ... there's just this slight cackle of madness , and how it felt so good ... 
he sets a quarter down , balances another by it's edge , and balances yet another on top of that edge . \patience . mixed with control ... you got any other coins ? i can do it with anything . \"" 
isn't it just shear boredom that sheds what thoughts pass under my eyes to be spared across this sunrise of endless ties through intimacy and friendship ... 
moments in time ... memories ... thoughts and expressions ... both inside and outside of one's own li'l world ... to cross this bridge in the everyday life , and bring upon the other side what lays in my mind ... 
\me ? i eat more than most . consumption is a must with my metabilism ... \ " he shivers a second and taps his chest . \ " an unending hunger i can only get tired of ... \"" 
\a nightmare ... \ " he whispers . \ " a challenge of fear ... can you face the mental injustices your mind places in your face when you're most vulnerable ? \"" 
a puzzle of incomprehensable proportions ... with pieces that change from person to person ... none of the answers are the same , but some peices are ... and we can not expect to find the answer ... only be haunted by the question ... 
AH HA ! the tensor tympani muscle is used to stretch the eardrum , and dampen the sound of chewing . as long as i can remember i've been able to voluntarily control this muscle , and thought everyone else could too . found out naw , it's rare . and became a weirdoe because normal wasn't enough for me anymore 
he sets down the time he's spent around theses parts , looking for the lost hearts , searching his mind for the cost of what could have been , and what was lost in the time he spent ... 
it's behind the six points , or six planes , that a seventh hides ... either inside the walls , or where everything intersects ... what your looking for , and what you can't get to ... lol is the cat dead/alive , or was the box always empty ? 
i couldn't see the path at the end of this trail , wondering to myself , if maybe this is hell . that maybe i could tell , in this darkness that fell , where the edge of a cliffside dwells ... 
it's once you take a simple matter and break it down , complicating it , that you never see it the same again . forever condemned to the torment that ignorance protected you from . forever condemned to question matters that seamed so second hand before ... 
the speyer struck with a fire drunk in the < PROPFEMALE>'s of fate , with the hollow i drank ... 
dammit ... it's not gonna be drugs , liquor , energy drinks , cigarettes , or weed that kills me ... just myself ... me against my own hands ... 
these chains , are a warning to those who don't know me , and a challenge to those who do . these songs are a path to the possibilities of who i could be . this body is but a shell . listen for my soul , ' cause it's the only way to know who i truly am , or comprehend what i could be ... 
i've been called ; to nice for my own good , a teacher , a beautiful creature , a trip , weird , eccentic , complicated , care free , odd , fucked up , an angel , mean , an asshole , < PROPMALE > , mean spirited , and also lost puppy ... if you know what , or who , this makes me , please let me in on the joke i've been unknowingly playing 
there's something heart wrenching about someone crying ... 
memories ... cascading as hail , with the wispiest of winds ... threatening to blow out what fire you've managed to start ... swirling around all that stands in it's way so it may finaly reach all you've made ... what are it's intentions ... why does it reach ... if only i could read the message ... 
i'm drifting ever so deeper into madness ... reality , and the world in my head , built off memories , thoughts , and wishes , are coming ever so much closer ... lol i got better when they thought i was retarded , but than i figured out i was just on a different ... level . reality is about perception , words , pictures , emotions ... and yet i still tried to conform ... 
it's the passion that drives first , where you sit there and think to yourself , i don't want to be anywhere else ...
