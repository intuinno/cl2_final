i think i had my life flash before my eyes have never been so scared in my life . one of my good friends pulled a knife and was ready to slit my throat never again will i let that happen again .... 
every cut you make is deeper the hurt you cause my shame , my soul is shattered searching for a way out , the hurt the tears the constant bliss of past memories , i hear your voice it helps me sleep at night , only to wake up in tears , in the end do you know what you know the pain im in ? the tears i shed do they cause you regret ? does my pain hurt you too knowing your the cause of it ? my pain is eternal
