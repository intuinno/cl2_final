Dear Flare sitting on my desk . You are a fish . You are a very happy fish . Even though you're always angry . OKAY MR ANGRY STOP PUFFING UP AT ME YOU HAVE A WIFE ALREADY AND I BET YOU WON'T HAVE TO TRADE LIKE THIRTY YEARS OF YOUR LIFE FOR NO SLEEP FROM THE CAFFEINE DEVIL /IN THE NEXT YEAR/ . 

Life will never cease to be a disappointment when you realize your greatest fear is not being able to live up to your ambitions . Striving and striving , trying to touch what you cannot reach . Sooner or later , it'll destroy you . 
UUURRGH TELL ME YOU'RE PREGNANT OR BOMBARD MY WITH TWILIGHT LADY GAGA ICONS /AND I SHOOT YOUR BRAINS OUT/ .

TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY ROOMMATE USING AN ONLINE VOICE SYNTHESIZER 
doubting my judgement right now . Hating how I'm too unsure to take initiative . 
isn't it unfair how you're always on mine , but I never cross yours ? 
dreamt that she saw a coyote behind BAC but < PROPFIRST > Ballison wouldn't acknowledge it was there and < PROPFEMALE > Swarley Sunde didn't see it . 
feels that she is the /most/ spiteful person /ever/ in the dream world . 
slow death by ambition , hopeless wistfulness , and the general lack of emotional strength to choose one path over another . 
Cremation < PROPFEMALE > . Monochrome Blue Sky . Cantarella .
