Man what's the matter ? Why isnt anyone else awake ? 

I sobered up , and i got to thinkin'\ 
Girl you ain't much fun since i quit drinkin'\ 
That's all . I'm gong to bed soon 
But how was I to know \ 
That she'd been shuffled before \ 
Said she'd never had a < PROPMALE > Flush \ 
But I should have known \ 
That all the cards were comin ' \ 
From the bottom of the pack \ 
And if I'd known what she was dealin ' out \ 
I'd have dealt it back 
I drove by Sacramento 6 theater tonight , and now i want to go to the drive in movies . 
Solve 
Just not good enough
