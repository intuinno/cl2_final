Easter at the families house ... Don't know how much longer my iPod will last ... Keeps telling me the battery is low ... I'm starting to think it lies but I don't want to risk it ... And why does nobody comment on my posts ? I though that's what facebook is all about ?

Kind of in a sour mood today so don't bug me =/ 
Just ran a mile ... Havnt done that in over a year ... I'm tired :(

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdKpxgAYC6Q&feature=youtube_gdata Watch it and love it ! XP 
Saw Iron Man 2 last night ! It was good and worth seeing , but I thought Kick A ** was better ! 
I won an award today ... I would be happier but it made me miss part of my math test =/ Otherwise yay ! Computer Science/Website Design Student of the year ! 
\I will forgive but I won't forget\ 
\The hardest ones to love are the ones who need it most . \"" 
\I can't feel anything at all\ 
Good morning everybody ! Got to wake up at 4 this morning :D that's earlier than school days ! If anybody is going to the < PROPFIRST > McDonald House Run thing I'll be there volunteering so look for me ! 
I hate my iPod ! Sometimes it spazzes and I can't read posts for like 10 minutes ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s party was fun ... Well other than the fact that I feel like I'm going to explode ... 
I just did the p90x ab ripper x ... Owwwww ! I think I'm going to throw up ... 
End of school bus party was awesome ! < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and of course me ! Lots of fun ! Except everybody was in cahoots against me except for < PROPMALE > ... I got the bus though :D I'm going to miss you < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > ! 
I feel lobstery ... I'm red ... Face , shoulders , back , upper arms , upper chest ... Oww ... 
Good luck everybody on your SATs ! 
I'm back from Cancun ! :D 
Okay everybody ignore the earlier profile picture with the cotton < PROPFEMALE > ! It looked really really dirty/wrong ... Thank you :D 
Like this and I'll tell you a like , dislike , first impression , and confession ! :D 
Have you ever read something on Facebook and felt dumber after reading it ? 
Three Days Grace ! Nickleback ! They are coming ! Together ! Concert ! Aaah ! October ! Aaaah ! October 30th !!! Aaah ! 
California is making my self esteem = blah ... :( 
If you don't think I'm ugly like this status \ 
thanks :D 
Californians don't like brunettes :( 
I'm happy again ! :D no worries ! 
Back from Cali :D 
I have my tickets to the Nickelback , Three Days Grace , Buckcherry concert ! So excited ! I can't wait ! October seems so far away ! 
I have this overwhelming urge to post something deep and meaningful ... But then I realize does anybody even care if it's meaningful at all ? Does anybody even read status updates ? When they do do they actually grasp the deep meaning or just keep on going down the wall ?

<3 
I don't like it when people post \I've answered a question about you\ " and things like this ... If you want to tell me what the question was and how you answered just post that on my wall ... It's a lot more personal ... " 
\If you feel so empty\ 
\This world will never be\ 
\Far from over\ 
I just figured out how the zombie outbreak will start ! :O McDonalds is going to come out with a new preservative ! Some of us will ingest it and it will kill us and preserve our body ... Thus creating zombies ! ( Yes I just thought of that >.<) 
Leavea one-word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR name . It can only be one word . No more than one word . :D 
Couple questions : Why does it seem that people don't do things for other people anymore ? They only do them if it benefits them as well ... Why is that ? Where are all the people out there that do things for people just because they can ? Last question . Why am I called a pushover when somebody asks me to do something and I do it for them ? It was no hassle for me . So it didn't do me any good but it did me no wrong either . 
I just watched about 1000 Scare Tactics videos on YouTube ... They are just too funny ! 
4:15 is amazing ! This is the most awake I've been since summer started ! 
So the government might come abduct Annelise Friedman , < PROPFIRST > Groneman , < PROPFIRST > Ferron , < PROPFEMALE > Grandusky , and I . :D 
So ... My iPod just ... Died ... It went into \recovery mode\ " bye bye all my Angry Birds data :*( " 
So I was taking my dogs out , usually my Mom comes with , but she went to go work out with her friends . I'm at the park and I just picked up both my dogs poops and threw the bags away . I grabbed a new bag and start walking away from the bag dispenser . This big black guy comes up the street and yells \Hey\ " I ignore it like I didnt hear . " 
My mom , < PROPFEMALE > Luboff Ferrara , Is a pit bull with lipstick >.< She went and talked to that guy who yelled at me last night ! lol It was pretty awesome ! 
Went to the UNLV football game with Connor and his parents ! They are all awesome and I had a great time with great seats ! Now I am having an interesting conversation with Annelise Friedman ! :D 
Has decide I'm a strange boy . I've been asking around ... And apparently other people don't make emergency escape routes for different scenarios . Zombies , psychopaths , terrorists , Mexican cartel , biological attack , etc . I always have a plan ... 
Wants to talk to a certain somebody but she isn't online :( 
Is having second thoughts ... which isn't normal for me ... Maybe ... Eh I don't know >.< 
Sometimes I feel like I want to live and experience adventures of magic and battle ! Books tease me ... Show me what others have experienced ... Making me realize that the most exciting thing in my life will probably be a roller coaster ... 
Today was pretty awesome ! Saw < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim finally ! Hilarious movie ! Then I went to Block Party with < PROPFEMALE > Byrd , < PROPFEMALE > , and Connor Barlow ! Lots of fun ! I got this awesome bear paw temporary tattoo thing ! Its pretty cool looking ! Tomorrow should be pretty awesome too ! :D 
Well my plans of going to Block Party and hanging out with Connor Barlow didnt work out ... Though I had a pretty good day anyways ! Finished my Calculus homework ! I think I'm backwards ... Senioritis is supposed to make you not do work ... I've done twice the work since this year has started ... Without complaint too ! O.o 
Is it just me or is YouTube all freaky right now ? D: I don't like it ! 
Open house went great ! Got more people interested in robotics than I thought ! I should be a salesman or something ! XP 
Just don't deny it\ 
Don't try to fight this\ 
And deal with it\ 
And that's just part of it\ 
If you were dead or still alive\ 
I don't care\ 
I don't care 
Getting off Facebook asap ! D: I need to focus on this essay for Mrs. Lawson ... 
Mr. Pauli's < PROPFIRST > Locke paper is making me feel really stupid ! I'm reading and grasping nothing from it ... Today hasn't been the best day by far . I doubt tomorrow will be any better . Days like today make me wonder if I will have a successful future . 
< PROPFEMALE > Grandusky came over so I can help her with her Physics homework ... One of the questions says \Woodcocks are the slowest birds : their average speed during courtship\ " What the freak ? Birds having sex ? D: What kind of physics problem is this ?! " 
Today was pretty awesome ! Went to Connor Barlow's Birthday party and had a blast ! We swam ... and ate and swam some more lol ... It sucks I had to leave early =/ They were just getting their Halo : Reach on XP It makes me want to get an xbox/xbox live ... Mine is broken :( 
Darn you Facebook ! I must log off of you ! You ... Procrastination machine ! D:< 
I'm done arguing with stupid people . You can't use your ignorance to get you out of everything ! \I didn't know it would happen . \ " Isn't a valid excuse in my book . I knew it was going to happen and warned you against it ! Your inability to listen is the reason why ...? On a side note : I'm glad I'm so replaceable ... Really not in the best mood right now ... " 
Was in a blah mood ... Then < PROPFEMALE > Piwowarski started talking to me ! She is currently my favorite person ! :D 
Just watched the new Glee ! I'm such a Gleek >.< It was pretty awesome ! I made SECTA Robotics a facebook < PROPFEMALE > ! The RoboRunners ! First meeting is October 14th ! Room 602 ! 
This whole week has been kind of blah for me ... Don't know why but it's gone really slow , really stressful , and overall kind of zombie-like ... Certain people make my day brighten but once that's gone ... It turns back to it's dark swampy self ... 
Does anybody know the procedures for Homecoming ? D: I'm sooooo lost ! Senior year and this is my first real dance ! Help ! 
I finished my calculus homework ! RAWR ! I feel accomplished now ! :D 
Is getting really tired of this cheap knockoff Photoshop wannabe ... It won't let me make my text awesome ! D:< 
Loves his walks to the bus after school XD Thanks Annelise Friedman and Connor Barlow for making it fun ! I love how we always meet such INTERESTING people ! Like Purse man ! and < PROPFIRST > Boy ! (He loves you Annelise ! )

Gubernatorial Debate with breakfast ! Delicious ! XD

Going to the Renaissance Fair with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow :D Should be fun ! :D

Had another amazing day ! Have a safe trip < PROPFEMALE > Byrd ! I love you ! I also enjoyed when you were hypnotized :P Quite hilarious ! I wish I got pictures XD I know some people did ! < PROPFEMALE > Bosse has video too ! Josten's made me think of how close graduation is ... Thanks Josten ... >.> Jerks lol This week is turning out great ! First 2010-2011 Secta Robotics . The RoboRunners . Meeting tomorrow ! 
My mood just turned flat ... Darn me and my ability to turn happiness into dread ... I was thinking about how everything is great right now ... Then I realized , I'm building all these relationships with people just to split up from all of them in a little under a year ... Yeah we all say we are gonna keep touch but with how busy our lives will be who will have time to keep in touch ? Exactly ... 
Getting ready for Homecoming ! :O 
That was freaky ! Flash flood/hail storm ! D: It was hitting my windows and I was like \What in the world\ " I went outside and there were little pieces of ice on the patio furniture O.o " 
I think that Mrs. Lawson needs to slow down a little on the reading assignments ... She wants us to read reading counts , To Kill a Mocking Bird ( with 1400 pages of notes ) and all my other AP class work ... add that to my laziness and you get a horrible mess of fail ... 
Wow ... So this scholarship through the DoD requires being 18 by August 1st , 2011 ... 10 freaking days ... I'm too young by 10 days ... Sometimes I wish I started a year late because of all the scholarships like this ... Thats full tuition that I could of won ... But nope ... UGH ~ ! 
INBOX ONLY : tell me something you've always wanted to tell me . It stays between us ! Put this on your status and see what you get ..... 
Off to see The < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show :O Never seen it before lol wish me luck ? 
So , the < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show is NEXT Saturday ... Which really stinks because we brought toast to the movie theater XD Next Saturday I have the awesome concert lol so I'll have to wait for the 4th Saturday in November now x.x So we say Salt ... That lady is a ninja flying squirrel with super strength ... She was doing things that were physically impossible lol 
I'm feeling really good right now ! Huge weight lifted from my shoulders type thing ! :D Listening to some Three Days Grace ! Can't wait for the concert next week ! :D Its gonna be great ! 
\Something's not right 
This week feels like the slowest week in the history of weeks ... Everything seems to move in slow motion . I have no drive to do anything ... When I have no drive my mind thinks too much and makes me feel crazy x.x 
Today is finally figurative Friday ! It's not actually Friday but it's the last day before a 5 day weekend !!! Don't expect my brain to be focused today :P 
I LOVE the controversial bus talks we have lol < PROPFEMALE > Covington , Johann Jauregui , and < PROPMALE > XD Though if anybody was recording them we would all be committed x.x Todays topics included : Crime and Law , HIV , Cancer , and Government Conspiracies ! 
I'm reading The Lost Symbol by < PROPFIRST > Brown ... I read the other 4 books already and this one is just as interesting ! His plot is always the same but the knowledge he puts into the books is amazing ! I just went and looked at some of the artwork that he talks about and its quite interesting ! 
I'm EXTREMELY excited for the Three Days Grace , Nickelback , Buckcherry concert tonight ! Its gonna be awesome !!! :D :D :D !!! Loving this 5 day weekend !!! 
The concert was freaking amazing ! Three Days Grace was AMAZING !!!!!!!! < PROPFEMALE > Byrd , < PROPFEMALE > Smith , and I rocked out XD It was a lot of fun ! Three Days Grace was amazing ! Buckcherry kind of stunk it up ... Nickelback put on a great show and all but Three Days Grace was too amazing XD 
\And tell me how I'm supposed to feel 
I'm wondering why it took me this long to figure out who my true friends are , or maybe its just that everybody seems to be changing . Maybe I'm changing , but I see myself as the constant in the situation . I would need to in order to maintain my sanity . Well try to at least . 
\If I get fat 
I love how our little walk to the bus group of Annelise Friedman and Connor Barlow has now expanded to include < PROPFIRST > Deaton , < PROPFIRST > Yuen , and Catalina(Cathy ) Esqueda(i hope I spelled that right O.o ) 
So , today is the start of my thank you week . I'll be going around thanking all those people who have changed my life . I'll be private messaging some and posting on walls . If you don't get a message or a wall post right away , don't worry you might have one coming . If you don't get one at all . Well then either I overlooked you or you didn't change my life . :P 
Who else is using Google Chrome ? If so are you having Facebook issues today ? My buttons under my status update don't show up . I can't write notes . I have to manually refresh and from the looks of it my chat isn't working . Its really really bugging me ... 
I shall be at the Sun Youth Forums tomorrow ! D: I've been sick all week but I refuse to miss this !!! 
\Your principles mean more to you than any money or success . \"" 
Darn you Facebook ! You distract me yet again ! 
Happy Thanksgiving everybody !!! 
I'm convinced I have no life . I'm spending my life playing with Photoshop . Well not really . I'm downloading brushes . I feel really lame ... That and the process is annoying ... 
I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown ... I'm stressing like nobody's business right now . I have to finish Frankenstein by Wednesday(I'm on < PROPFEMALE > 40 ) , Government packet by Thursday , Frankenstein chapter 3 and 4 questions , Notes on Frankenstein , Catch up on Calculus notes , understand calculus notes , Catch up on Physics notes , Do 5 Physics assignments of various lengths , Answer Sun Youth Forum Questions ... 
Just want to say that I love Annelise Friedman , < PROPFEMALE > Byrd , and < PROPFIRST > Yuen ! Just saying :P 
Ok , so my water heater broke this morning ... No hot water . Oh , and by the way , our house is heated by the water heater ... So no heat in the house whatsoever ... I'm currently sitting in my room frozen . My fingers are freezing up ... Oh and some punks jumped over the wall and landed on the AC unit ... Dented ours a little and my neighbors a lot . My dad is talking with the police now ... 
I got a hot shower :D :D :D 
I'm doing that cartoon character thing . The one where you turn your profile pic to a cartoon to protest child abuse or something . 
Off to this stupid Parade of lights thing ... I'm expecting our robot to die half way through and end up having to like withdraw from the parade ... LAME ! Ugh ... Don't want to go ... 
Why do Korean games have such high security ? You need a KSSN(Korean Social Security Number ) to play a game ... Ridiculous I think so ... 
So I'm currently in a , I'm not sure how to describe it , less than depressed but a little more than discontent . Not really the feeling I expected after finally turning in my Frankenstein notes . If you want to know why I feel this way you can ask . I may not answer though :P 
Feeling a bit better thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Byrd . I'm hopefully be back up and running by tomorrow ... 
No offense to those that are doing it , but that number game is getting REALLY annoying ... My wall is spammed with #s and what you think about somebody that I don't care about . Can't you just tell them to their face ? Or in a private message ? \ 
Thanks ~ ! 
Finished another freaking government packet ... At the end of the year I might burn them all ... Sounds good to me ... 
Finished my essay ! :D :D :D Finally ! :D :D :D Thanks < PROPFIRST > Yuen for the proofread and OCD on my paper :P 
Type your name : < PROPFIRST > Ferrara\ 
With your elbow : < PROPFIRST > ferrara\ 
With your nose : < PROPFIRST > ferrara\ 
Eyes closed , one finger : < PROPFIRST > fettata\ 
\ 
I did better Zac :P 
Finished that freaking packet for Government ... Getting tired of these ... Off to Flatland I go ! 
I'm sorry I smell like cleaning products ! - < PROPFIRST > to < PROPFEMALE > concerning my breath . 
< PROPMALE > Blue or Faded Blue Converse ? D: 
So today I saw Tron with < PROPFIRST > Yuen , Connor Barlow , and < PROPFIRST > Smythe . It was pretty good . The action sequences were pretty awesome . I just didn't understand why everybody had to flip through the air to throw a disc . Anyway , after the movie we went to borders and Apple where Annelise Friedman met us . We went to California Pizza Kitchen and then Yogurtland . Overall a great day ! 
So yesterday night , though my original plans got canceled , I ended up at the Galleria Mall where I saw < PROPFEMALE > during dinner . I met her sister < PROPFEMALE > who was pretty cool . Then I met < PROPFEMALE > Smith in Gamestop where we bugged < PROPFEMALE > Byrd . < PROPFEMALE > and I then went to Hot Topic , and a bunch of other stores . Lots of fun ! Inside jokes are the best ! \You made me ruin my pants ! I got these at Hot Topic ! \ " haha ! " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! I sent a negative Christmas status last night but it hasn't shown up on here so =/ Probably in 2 days you will see my negative Christmas post , but for now , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!! 
I'm easily annoyed today ... 
Long hot shower with a pear in hand = the best way to think XD I could probably cure cancer if the shower was long enough and the pear didnt end :P 
Is it possible to lose your mind in a good way ? If so I think I've accomplished it :D 
I need another Orange/Plum/Pear ... But I should eat something of substance like a bagel ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Smith came over today , we played Halo with < PROPFIRST > Ferron , we made a beastly team ! Laser and explosion fight ! Oh and Gravity Hammer , it makes me laugh manically ... Then < PROPFEMALE > and I talked about the Bible and how its far to easy to go to Hell ... Its so strict that I think we are all going to Hell =/ 
Firework\ 
Brilliant and vibrant\ 
Hypnotizing with it's illusion of hope and happiness\ 
Yet gone in the same instance\ 
Leaving a gap of enumerable length\ 
Nagging and tearing\ 
Seemingly darker than before\ 
How does something so short hurt so much ? 
\Creepy < PROPFIRST > is Creepy\ " - Annelise Friedman " 
I'm loving me some Chevelle today ! 
Fastest $25 itunes I've ever spent =/ Got a bunch of Chevelle , some MCR , some Cage The Elephant , and some other random songs . :) 
\You're right 
Just had a ridiculous conversation with < PROPFIRST > Yuen about my lack of political introduction and then philosophy of different types ... He actually made me think ... Shame on you < PROPFIRST > >.> 
So , I had a dream last night , it was one of those dreams where everything is going right and it's perfect , and then you wake up ... Yeah , so I'm kind of bummed ... 
There are people in this world that are worth getting to know and working to develop deep friendships with . The hard part is sifting through everybody else . 
Annelise friedman is the prettiest best person ever : 
< PROPFEMALE > Byrd is the coolest , most awesome person I know and I'm lucky to have her consider me a friend . 
< PROPFEMALE > Esqueda is way smarter than I am , I am an idiot compared to her . 
It be essay writing time ... Now just to figure out what to write ... 
I have reached a new level of procrastination ... 
\Thou < PROPMALE > not what thou wast before 
I'd like to admit my undying love for Annelise Friedman . She is amazing <3 I've gone to school with her for a while and I'm really glad that I got to know her this year . She is one of the greatest people alive . 
I'd also like to thank < PROPFIRST > Kennedy for being a great friend and an inspiration to all ! I haven't known him long but he is definitely one of my greatest friends and I am more than glad I have met him . 
< PROPFEMALE > Byrd , couldn't wait five minutes for me to figure out all of what I wanted to say to you . You are my best friend and I trust you with my life . Though your abuse is persistent and annoying I love you anyway . You are a great friend and we shall stay in touch forever ! 
Going to go sit out front and read . Text me if you need me . 
That moment when your whole mindset does a flip , you feel like there is a black hole in your stomach . 
Watching state of the union , is it required that you stand and clap after he finishes each stanza ? Are there signs that tell them to stand and clap ? 
Why have I wasted so much of my life playing video games ? There are so many better things to pursue in life . The only thing that video games have accomplished is teaching me to read through tech forums when they dont work . Lovely . Thats going to do a lot for me in the future . 
This is the best I've felt in a long while . The oddest things bring me happiness . I feel free again . My head isn't cloudy anymore , everything is so focused . I just feel overall great ! 
is sick and is watching syfy ... MegaPython vs . Gatoroid ... So cheesy ... 
My itunes broke =/ Now I have to reinstall it . < PROPFIRST > Mad . 
Procrastination you win tonight ! I will defeat you tomorrow ! Well maybe the next day ... 
Is actually writing an essay ?! Say What ?! 
What is with this hug a tall person day and why did it come at such a great time ? Perfect timing , I think so ! 
I'm extremely flustered right now . This is going down in my book as one of the greatest nights ever . :) 
Is becoming quite irritated with my computer . Thank goodness for google <3 Though I'm kind of sad that I cleared all my history and temp files etc . Troubleshooting fail :( 
Sadies was awesome !!! My arsenal of great white boy moves has expanded ! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Smith , you have taught me lots ! Including the Waltz XD Pics will be up tomorrow ! 
Pirates = bad . Lots of Somalian pirates = lots of bad . Seychelles wants to repatriate pirates . Somalian jails up to par ? We don't know yet ! ( Is this a good enough summary for Mrs. Lawson ? ) 
So today has been weird , I got all blah when I got home . Which isn't that odd I guess . It happens pretty often , but food didn't help . Which is definitely odd . I'm feeling better now though . 
\Trying to throw me a line\ 
Is organizing the agenda of the Ways & Means committee of the United States House of Representatives . 
Why do I care so much ? 
Let the Revolution begin ! 
So my day in a nutshell ... I went to my first Catholic church mass . It was a lot different ! It wasn't bad , but I don't think its for me . Then I went to Zia records , < PROPFIRST>'s Deli , Barnes and < PROPMALE > , and Bestbuy ! Then I learned to ride a bike ! ( Yeah say your condescending bike comments ) Thanks < PROPFIRST > Kennedy for the awesome day ! 
So , the century link guy has taken away my phone , Internet and tv ... I know that usually means he gets shanked but I'm cutting him slack because I'm supposed go out today . Don't know what's happening with that ... 
Worst President's Day EVER ... 
Nothing seems to line up quite right\ 
--------- ______ 
I love when people think you are emotionally compromised but then you prove to them your not through your directness and bluntness :D I love talking to people ! 
One time at Subway , I saw Hitler , and he had balls . Thanks Annelise Friedman for the weirdest conversations . :P 
There must be something wrong with me ... Nobody should be this creepy ... 
Some days I just feel so taken for granted , so unvalued , so taken advantage of . Eh , whatever . Not caring currently . 
Reposting from < PROPFEMALE > Byrd : ATTENTION !! ATTENTION !! ALL PROFICIENT JUNIORS AND SENIORS , I AM PLANNING A FOOD/MOVIE/HANGOUT DAY ON TUESDAY !! It will probably start around 12 at Cane's chicken and then the movie should be between 2 and 3 . Let me know if you are going or not please so I can make sure no one gets left out !! 
Government Packet =[ 
Today was awesome ! Tons of people there and I had a great time ! XD I'm just going to tag everybody now . < PROPFEMALE > Byrd , < PROPFIRST > Kennedy , < PROPFEMALE > Stokes , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Yuen , < PROPMALE > Beach , < PROPFIRST > Smythe , < PROPFIRST > Deaton , < PROPFEMALE > Grandusky , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Carrick , < PROPFEMALE > Buss , < PROPFEMALE > Avila , and < PROPFEMALE > . 
And so my eternal quest for love continues on this daunting journey . How long , how far , how dangerous , all reasonable questions that only time will answer . My mind is set on the prize though , and I have the fierce determination needed to conquer any obstacle in my path . 
Century Link ! You strike again ! 
Last night , I breached my creepy limit two times over . I had fun though ! :D Thanks < PROPFIRST > Kennedy ! 
I've decided that I write WAY too much poetry ... 
\i'm to sexy for my shirt to sexy for my -\" < PROPFEMALE > Pedri\ 
I guess you never really know someone . I'm really just angry right now . I'm getting tired of people . They are all just plain stupid ! 
:]
