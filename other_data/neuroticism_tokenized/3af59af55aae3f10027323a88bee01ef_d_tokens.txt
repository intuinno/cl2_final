Curious - Is Facebook now requiring personal E-mail acceptance of application notifications in order to receive and send gifts ?? 

I have tried 3 days in a row to send \recruit Mafia\ " ( big black M version ) invitations to all my friends who have the application (!!) - is the \ " send invite\ " feature working for everyone else or is it out of service ??? " 
I was ( finailly ) allowed to send out Mafia Wars recruitment requests (!!) - if you participate in the game ( or not , but just want to help me out ) please accept membership in my Mafia - thank you to my Cafe World and Farmville Friends - I can participate fully again ( !! I hope anyway !! ) - problem seemed to only affect recruiting . . . 
My Mafia members : update wish lists if you need to - if I have it I'll send it .... New members - you will get your daily energy pack tomorrow ( it's been sent for today ) 
I may have FINALLY figured out the correct way to send/receive Mafia Wars RESPECT mail - still learning the ends & outs of this game ( collect respect from inside the game or you don't get the bonus ... I think - LOL ) 
Mafia Wars friends - I'm helping everyone I can (!!) - Lots of bonus opportunities to be picked up off my profile wall that reward you but do not cost you anything - 
In loving memory of every cancer patient , family and friends who have lost the battle of cancer and the ones who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > if you know someone who has or had cancer . Dear God , I pray for the cure of cancer . Amen . 93% won't copy and paste this . I did , but will you ??? ( previously posted by < PROPFIRST > Finlay - thank you < PROPFIRST > ... 
Mafia Wars - I am watching for \Help Needed - EASTER JOB\ " - I can help 4 more friends find their eggs during the next 7 hours !! I can't help if you don't post ! " 
I give up - ( LOL ) - Now it says ( Mafia War Easter Job ) that I have already helped my 5 person limit - I've only found one egg today !! 
Mafia Wars Easter Job Help Limit Update - LMAO - it depends on WHICH egg you're looking for - I've been allowed to help on a Plaid and a Checkered so far today - but I have to wait to help 8 hours and 3 hours for two of the others - 
Mafia Wars - I think the application will let me help on your EASTER jobs - but I can't find any unexpired postings !! Repost \Ask Mafia to Help\ " ( I said I THINK - LOL - it will let me help !! " 
( Mafia Wars ) I'm chomping at the bit to help find Easter Eggs , but can not find any \Mafia Help Needed\ " requests ... and I don't want to use any energy until I help my friends .... " 
Mafia Wars finally allowed me to help look for another egg - Now says I must wait One hour 47 minutes to help on the next one - Help each other if you can !! :) 
I want to thank everyone for helping each other on the Easter Job - I helped as many people as the application allowed - I'm sure everyone did their share - My hope was that every Mafia member was able to vault the collection - if I could have helped more people than 5 every 8 hours or found a way to make it happen for everyone , I would have !! 
Let's see who is paying attention .... Every single one of you are on my Friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I am not only glad to count you as friends but also as ( MAFIA ) family ! Let's see who in my Friends list actually pays attention . Copy and paste this in your status . I will be watching to see who really likes me . 
I'm trying to get all my Mafia Members into < PROPFIRST > Rajski's Mafia - I run that and can still help on \Collections Mafia Assit\ " from New York there ( it's sending me to Cuba when I try to help ) - " 
FACEBOOK MANAGEMENT : If you want us to play games and be social you have to let us . It is impossible to do now ! Instead of grouping all the posts together because of non gamers ' complaints tell them how to hide them . Then everyone is happy ! They can hide our posts ... and we can easily see them . Copy and paste if you agree 
According to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy , it dseno't mtaetr waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are , the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae .

For some unknown reason , I can not access \Mafia Wars\ " - I guess I will be unable to help anyone or send anything today ... I will keep trying - suggestions welcome ... " 
I am not being allowed to click anything , or access Mafia Wars to work on my own jobs - I've taken all suggestions , and nothing works - I guess I'll go watch a movie - sorry Mafia family about not being able to send energy , help , or gifts - maybe I'll be missed ... 
Well - I couldn't access my Mafia from my computer , but < PROPFIRST > logged in and accessed HIS mafia from my computer ... he got booted off Cafe World ( LOL ) so he logged out - Now I'm being allowed to access My Mafia ( finally ) again - I had to stop playing Cafe World and Farmville to make Mafia Wars work ... Any way , I guess I'm back :) \You have 1099 experience points to your next level \"" 
Mafia Wars - How's everyone doing in < PROPFIRST > ? 
It got late quick !! Collected my 10 < PROPFIRST > maps ( every 24 hours , don't forget ! ) - last site visited \New York\ " ( important for the forges and weapons depot ) - and now I can ( must ) let the dog in ( LOL ) - back to help in a few !! " 
Everybody who was assigned top mafia slots in my Mafia yesterday - the menu has reverted back to the old way .... it was an adventure , futile but fun for 5 seconds - LOL 
Today would have been my 32nd Kroger Service Anniversary if I hadn't become ill ... I lasted over 30 years , 22 years longer than my Doctor predicted ... but I am very sad , because frankly ( scream ) \I'd rather be working\ " ... makes me a strange duck I guess ... " 
I've gotten invited to a \yard pick-up party\ " !!! I usually get left out ... ( long story ) ... I promise to help with your stuff when I get home !! " 
My Mafia - Sorry , been ill - will try to at least make sure energy is sent - changes in the flashing stuff on site seem to be triggering seizure activity which is not good news - miss everyone - hope to see you again soon 
Thought for the day : Ask yourself , if I suddenly lost the ability to speak , how would/could I still \communicate\ " - ( I already know about the TDDY machine ) - anyway - LOL - I'm taking suggestions !! ?? !! " 
I do , at least , know for certain that if < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > SWANSON ( my adopted mom , my only mom , the best mom in the world ) were still alive - she would HELP me , and my Social Security Medical Disability WOULD have gone through like clockwork ON THE FIRST TRY - I can find NO ONE to HELP ME !!! I can NO LONGER AFFORD to HIRE someone - I CAN NOT PAY MY BILLS - I HELPED EVERYONE ELSE PAY THEIRS - nothing left .... 
Monday schedule - go to Indiana Vocational Rehab - have them fill THEIR information in on the appropriate line , stop and get medical malpractice intial interview papers in case I need those , Go to Social Security Office with all of the above plus anything else I can possibly think of that might be needed - Call ( with voice/speaking problem ? ) Dr. H 
myalgic encephalomyelitis , a syndrome involving inflammation of the central nervous system with symptoms of muscle pain and fatigue ; the term has sometimes been used interchangeably with chronic fatigue syndrome , though there is still controversy over the distinction . 
What is \NEWEST\ " ??? I seem to be losing my \ " ability\ " to \ " Stay\ " \ " Spastic\ " - " 
Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face , except for a punch in the face , but we can still raise awareness . 
Ok - Number one , if you joined the feed too recently to know the rules - absenting any humor whatsoever - you don't YOU don't know what I'm doing - You had to be \reading up\ " from the first post just past Mafia War playing - when < PROPFIRST > once too often ticked me off and I had to \ " Put the boxing gloves on\ " - I can start over if I have to ** " 
( < PROPFIRST > insists I don't have MS ) Without reading the Medical Reports I have in front of me * Without reading the medical reports I have in front of me < PROPFIRST > made the mistake he always made , which was to think I knew less about Me than he did * 
Anyway : I received a gift in the mail from < PROPFIRST > Mellinger out of the blue , and , stupid me*I called to say - just to say - Thank you * 
The tests that were run on me after I started falling down ( at work & at home ) in March of 2008 , Specifically : the MRI showed 5 brain lesions and White Matter-small vessel ischemic desease \old and new \"* Confirming that it Was an undiagnosed stroke ( ischemic attacks/strokes in layman's terminology ) I suffered in 1997 * " 
* I agree - < PROPFIRST > screwed up when he \woke a sleeping dog\ " - BUT * Joy is back in the Saddle Again * One Dollar four cents in BANK * Hence all the new Activity * Since I have no insurance ( that had a deadline too ) a doctor visit is a moot point with me * but Dr. H trained me well - I've been doing my \ " homework\ " including finding a no-insurance clinic option * " 
The hardest part of all is * staying focused * - while also trying to get to know some family members and friends who have been in contact*and forgetting they don't know me well or as I am now , My mixing up homework with personal work is understandable and I hope forgiven . ** It seems I can apoligize until I'm \blue in the face\ " for being me . " 
p.s. Since I was raised to not swear I have removed that comment from < PROPFIRST>'s Wall and left only the \politically correct\ " posts ** LOL " 
++2 : ... even though they wouldn't admit me . I'm in South Bend , and the only people I know well in South Bend are Dad and Marcile , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . I went by taxi TO South Bend ( 90/10insurance ) BY taxi , with Name , Insurance name , all doctors names , the fact I had been to Dunlap Urgent Care three times the previous week , everything needed ... 
pause ( interupting myself ) Friends are allowed to post - note was to let panicked family members late arriving family members give family members a break how patient are you 
++3 : ... I went by taxi to the hospital Kroger said to go to with everything written down^^After Dad and Marcile watched me try to eat some dinner they took me to Mishawaka hospital - neither Dad nor Marcile read what I had written , and that was okay as long as the hospital did . 
++3 : ( more weird stuff ) ... I went by taxi to the hospital Kroger said to go to with everything written down^^After Dad and Marcile watched me try to eat some dinner they took me to Mishawaka hospital - neither Dad nor Marcile read what I had written , and that was okay as long as the hospital did . 
now I have to explain why there are two nearly identical posts (++3 ) - technology is a friend unless you have something really important to clear up - a long story over the 420 typed letters limit ** But since I'm very methodical I cut and pasted the whole longer post to office program , I can fix this easily - facebook popped up to let me know post was 
too long . 
++4 : As long as the Mishawaka Hospital Dad and Marcile took me to did . Mishawaka hospital Didn't read what I wrote . I didn't know that . Dad and Marcile didn't know that . 
++5 - I didn't know so there I was , confident that the medical people would do their job so I'm happy until they release me 3 days later without doing anything for me -- the Mishawaka hospital hadn't read what I wrote 
++6 - None of the people , me , Dad , Marcile , none of us knew WHY I had been released without my getting any help [ anybody else tired - I am - LOL ] 
++8 : WWJD ?? I have a feeling he'd feel pretty much like I did . 
++9 : But I have no idea what even he could have done different than I tried to do*I made doctors appointments and went , wrote down the names of the doctors I saw , one massive multi-legged misunderstanding ALL the way around*I didn't know why I wasn't being helped but when the ( I ) requested to be returned to me - now unsealed for the first time by the records lady from the Mishawaka Hospital ... 
++10 : Took my all my medical records to a lawyer - kept making those hard phone calls - so I was collecting data I thought would help me - and since Mom used to say \I cut my teeth on medical books\ " ( I was planning on being a doctor before the encephalitic scar in 1975 ) " 
++11 : I even hired < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > to go with me to the neurologist's office in Goshen( < PROPFEMALE > had retired from Kroger , and supplimented her income by taking care of elderly people-home health aid ) 
++12 : < PROPFEMALE > started to read what I had wrote down needed to be said , and the Doctor yelled/barked at her that I had to speak for myself , so I did . Between the two of us ( the neurologist and I ) it scared < PROPFEMALE > so bad she had to go home to change clothes - SO that information went to the lawyer too ; But I took the \released-to-go-back to work slip \"" 
++13 : The neurologist had released me to go back to work - took the slip in to my Kroger and handed it to < PROPFEMALE > - If you could have seen < PROPFEMALE>'s face when I handed her my release to go back to work - So in March of 1998 - I cleaned the Kroger bathrooms par t-t ime , 3 nights a week , 4 hours a night - until I could walk and speak normally - 
++15 : The president of the Epilepsy support group was very pro-active , she had been the one who called the Elkhart Truth when I celebrated my 10th Service Anniversary at Kroger in 1988 - no one else in the group had been able to keep a job for even that long - LOL - I had to take another medical leave in 2004 when the seizures again went out of control - Hensley's new office was an easy drive on the toll road , thank 
Yes , I'm sorry Boys and Girls - I'm not done - If anybody out there has a problem with what I'm doing - I am doing what needs to be done - I am doing my job - Anybody who knows me , knows I do my job . I am in charge of my life - once again there is a problem to be solved - I am going to solve the problem - Key Point - I know what I am doing . 
++18 : Social Security Disability Income , and incidently , Insurance : I earned it . I haven't gotten it . I need it . Period . So currently , new crisis . Solve crisis . Period . 
++19 : If I didn't need it , not getting it would not BE a crisis . Sounds Right to Me . 
++20 : ( I can just hear Dr. H saying , keep going ) I am doing the job I have assigned to myself - since I can not afford to go to make an appointmnt - becuase I have no money - because SS drug their feet . 
++21 : I could present myself in an emergency room - except , I tried to do that before - and it didn't work . Luckily ( LOL ) I had either < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > , NOT < PROPFIRST > , as a \contact number\ " - so I was rescued that time - but the hospital and the \ " psychiatrists\ " name - went to the lawyer too . Went becuase I knew I had a medical crisis " 
++22 : It didn't work - I was given a shot of Haldol , left alone in the wheel chair , slid out and cracked my face on the floor . Thank God I knew enough to call < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > to come and rescue me . 
++24 : who did not do any of those things either . Note to Family for future of Joy : It has been medically proven - NO MEDICATIONS perscriptions by any doctor = from the barbituate or benzodiapene family - SEE \PDR\ " ( physicians desk reference ) for assistance . " 
++25 : Continuing with our program ( I do have a sense of humor - surprise -) Doing the job I have assigned to myself - to solve a problem . 
++26 : Fact : If Mom hadn't died I wouldn't be having the problem I'm trying solve . I didn't know this until < PROPFEMALE > Weaver told me . 
++27 : Fact : Mom thought the family knew I had a medical problem - sounds funny I know - but bear with me - 
++32 : jumping through the hoops . And just went right on with my life . I don't get to talk to most family members very often - my big brother < PROPFIRST > is in Pennsylvannia . I have had - LOL - seizures at : bus station : an airport ; so I do not choose to travel alone - consequently I haven't seen < PROPFIRST > as much as I would like . 
++33 : For whatever the reason , she's never talked to me - definite impression - < PROPFIRST > never liked me - I assumed she loved me as much as I loved her - but she never gave me the impression anyway , that she liked me . I do not inflict myself on people who do not lke me . When I was in 4th grade , we were asked what is your pet peeve ? 
++34 : Pet peeve in 4th grade ? my answer was , \people\ " . \ " people make me sick ' . Mom asked me what my seizures felt like . Mom knew I had a seizure disorder and Mom assumed the family knew it too . Mom died . Kroger called < PROPFIRST > - yet I still had to " 
++36 : I had TOLD family members , when Dad dies , someone had to come personally , not just use a phone . I tried to keep my family up to date on my life ; seriously - I mean I thought they were up to date on my life - but when Dad died thank God the cell phone had no minutes on it - somebody thought to call < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > - ask them to 
++37 : Somebody finally thought to call < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , my cousins down the road that I hadn't seen in a coon's age - to come to my house to let me know in person that my Dad had died . 
++38 : I had considered , particularly after Mom passed away at 59 - that every year after Dad turned 60 was a gift from God . Dad was lost after Mom died . He was a \typical male human\ " - ( note to joy - finally writing my entry for the \ " I miss my Dad page\ " - facebook friends are allowed to laugh - family allowed to cry ) " 
++40 : On the way home from the funeral < PROPFIRST > turns to me and says somebody she knows ... had talked to her about her daughter's illness ... and since < PROPFIRST > knew me 
++41 : ( knew me ?? ) 
++43 : Dad died in November 2008 . My earned ( based on my medical records ) Kroger ( made it over 30 years - THAT's a newspaper story !!! ) Disability Retirement Pension began in December 2008 - in time to pay my part of Dad's funeral , Thank God . 
++44 : Personally , I think a normal person would have thought maybe < PROPFIRST > needed HER head examined for saying that , considering she was my sister . I am not normal , I was born with brain damage - < PROPFEMALE > Weaver told me - when < PROPFIRST > was around age two . That was why mom had \played school\ " when I ( and < PROPFIRST > ) was little . " 
++47 : \Scar tissue on right front temporal lobe of the brain\ " the Complex Partial Epilepsy was correctly diagnosed in 1986 - by Dr. < PROPFIRST > Graber - a NEUROpsychiatrist - 1986 " 
++48 : < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Swanson , best mom in the world , after the scar tissue had been found , had taken me to Dr. Yuhn - < PROPFIRST > , he was a NEUROpsychiatrist - What does a neuropsychiatrist do - what is his job description ?? A neuropsychiatrist helps a person with proven medical neurological damage learn how to live with normal people 
++49 : without losing what's left of their minds . Dr. Hensley , if you're not signed in at the moment ( LOL ) - do I get an A+ - 
++50 : Because I was pregnant at the time , the safest available anti-convulsant Dr. Graber could prescribe was \Phenobarbital\ " - I was still on Phenobarbital when I had the seizure on the checklanes - < PROPFIRST > talked to Mr. Simkins - I was forced to go through the Oaklawn Day Treatment program to get my Job back - and there lo and behold " 
++51 : was Dr. < PROPMALE > Hensley , best Doctor in the world . He took me off the phenobarbital , and put me on Tegretol ( Dr. Graber had planned to put me on Tegretol when I was no longer pregnant , but I'd done so well on it he didn't want to risk changing something that worked , and I understand that ( Dr. Graber , you were never in the envelope ) 
++52 : So < PROPFIRST > , since you won't tell me what you did say when Mr. Simkins talked to you after the seizure on the checklanes and I never knew what you'd said - - In spite of all that - I did get hooked up with the local expert on Complex Partial Epilepsy - You accidently did me a favor .... 
++53 : But what I can't understand is - YOU never read the Elkhart Truth story about \Living with Epilepsy\ " interviewing both Dr. Hensley and me ?? My own sister ?? if you read it and still thought \ " I was mentally ill all my life\ " Dr. Hensley needs you to make an appointment with him . If you didn't read it - you missed a well-written story - I have a copy you can have . " 
++54 : About a Year after Mom died , maybe less ( I never could remember the anniversary ) Dad married Marcile , the best stepmom in the world . Definition : takes care of Dad !! 
++55 : My epilepsy was a fact - you do not explain facts - I was living my own life . 
++56 : Tegretol , which worked so well for me , started making my blood lukemic and had to be changed - I had an out of whack thyroid for a while , I was treated for proven Chronic Fatigue Syndrom at one point . FAMILY : When you have to go to the hospital and have proven neurological damage , your doctor is a neuropsychiatrit , you go \where " 
++58 : Because I was an adopted child - a pretty Damn lucky one at that . Mom had all my medical records but when Mom died , < PROPFIRST > didn't read them , she burned them . 
++59 : Undiagnosed Stroke in Dec . 1997 : I had been living my own life , seeing Dad and Marcile on holidays - < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > almost never , since I worked 6 shifts a week , 50 weeks a year . 
++60 : When I woke up to go to work - I was living with < PROPFIRST > Mellinger - I couldn't talk right - I was head file clerk ( so was in charge of getting all the prices changed ) and it was the night that had to be done . < PROPFIRST > did not think I should go to work - but to work I went , with a note explaining ( when I was reported drunk - to show anyone who might 
++63 : Drove myself to Goshen hospital where they did a Cat's Scan drove home to my own house - ( made a mistake earlier and said living with < PROPFIRST > - I had my own house , I had stayed the day before with < PROPFIRST > so he was there when I woke up slurring my words/walking like a drunk ) - 
++64 : I painstakedly wrote out everything someone else would have just said out loud : I'd been to Dunlap Urgent Care 3 times the previous week - ( I thought the seizures were out of control due to a kidney infection ) - the doctors I had seen - Medical History - and then called Kroger to find out which hospital to go to . 
++65 : No One Reads What I Write**except Dr. Hensley . Found him in 2004 when the seizure disorder went out of control ... took him all the material I had amassed in the meantime - poor guy - I was off on medical leave a year and two weeks that time . I took brain-re-train ( that's what I called it ) math and communications at < PROPFEMALE > Tech - got 
++66 : When the Lamictal made the rest of my teeth lose ( I fell and knocked some out ) I had the rest pulled ( < PROPFEMALE > Saunders thought that rough ) and got a full set of dentures . I just put one foot in front of the other and kept going . And going . 
++67 : Since I've been re-tired and have so much more time on my hands - I've made some friends - < PROPFIRST > Rajski actually read some MS material and doesn't look at me like I'm a bug - < PROPFIRST > has been over a lot -We lost < PROPMALE > Feb . 12 and I was able to go to the funeral . I can't use a telephone very well - I tried to make an appointment with Dr. 
++68 : tried to use the phone to call Dr. Hensley 3 days ago , and couldn't get through the menu - it would be funny if it wasn't funny . When my Kroger Insurance ran out and I couldn't afford my Lamictal or my Provigil any longer ... but the new vocal cord involvement is really scary - 
++69 : Last word : I need to be in a hospital to find out if I have new brain or spinal lesions - I need to be able to get and RE-learn to take it regularly - I do NOT have \ 
AIDS ( thought I was being treated like the plague , so I had myself tested - laugh out loud - everyone ) All family members get on the same < PROPFEMALE > and make sure I know what it is . < PROPFIRST > - if you think I made you sick - get over it . 
++70 : Appropriate , since I feel like I am ( 70 ) - Family : if you want to keep me , as family , feel free to ask any medical questions have - I have answers . If you are blaming or torturing each other , over me , stop . If you are blaming me for something and haven't talked to me about it , stop . No family is responsible for my illness . No one did anything wrong . Medical Misunderstanding , PERIOD . 
++71 : I can't speak for anybody else . However , if after all of this , anyone is feeling guilt over Dad's death , stop . < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > know I accepted Dad's suicide as a personal choice , made by him . Dad was innocent of any wrongdoing , stated publicly . Stop Blaming Marcile if you are - she didn't pull the trigger - and let's face it - you weren't there for him . 
++72 : Pretty stressful . I was the best Daughter I could be . I am free of guilt . Period . I was the best Employee I could be . Period . When I am a friend , I am the best friend a person could ever have . Period . 
++73 : Marcile : I Know you were good for Dad - Without you , he would have gone much sooner - you saw him through intestinal cancer , heart attacks , Quad by-pass - thick and thin - You have been , and I hope will continue to be , the best step-mother . 
++74 : Since the doctors told Mom and Dad in 1975 that I would never go to college - I had to go on my own , and I did . Period . I wanted to be a doctor , that option was removed from my Life - I studied anyway . Period . If you know more than me , talk , and I'll listen . If not , don't talk to me , ask questions . Period . 
++75 : I stand on my own two feet ( still ) \ 
I supported myself asking no one for help . Financial help was never asked for . Period . 
++76 : Somewhere along the line , I defined the seizure triggers I had to work to avoid . \ 
To the best of my ability , I have avoided seizure triggers , so that I could be the best person I could be . Period . 
++77 : I defined my Epilepsy - It does NOT define ME . I never let my Epilepsy stop me from trying to live the best life I could . Having MS does not define me - I won't let it - 
++80 : \Mid-life Crisis\ " - as a term ( paper ? ) - I understand better than anyone I know . \ 
++81 : Let's talk terms : Mentally Ill equals InSane Asylum , from where I come from . I am not locked up . Brain damage equals Learning Disability . Family Values equals good family . Old Age equals weakness , bad eye sight , etc . Epilepsy equals allergic reaction to Life . Borderline Personality Disorder > Borderline Person > Epileptic > Allergic > learning disability > brain damaged > birth . 
++83 : Fact : Scar tissue does not go away . the cat scan at goshen general did not show scar tissue . MS plaque deposits show up as scar tissue then disolve . 
pause - I have to eat , and < PROPFIRST > has to go rake the garden at < PROPFIRST>'s - finish tonight or tomorrow - see you later 
Interestingly enough - my first husband - Last Names - Adopted by Step-Parent :\ 
His birthfathers name was Korovesis . When I met him ( customer at Kroger ) his last name was Silverstein , The name change came through just days before we said I do . \ 
I learned to SPELL his last ( LOL ) before < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Korovesis . I remember his SS# - - - - - - - - - :) but I don't think you need it - I don't need it - but I kept it anyway 
Interested - my 2nd husband - Last names - Adopted by Step-Parent : His birthfathers name was Swanson ( no relationship to < PROPMALE > A . Swanson ) < PROPFIRST>'s Mother had re-married , to a Robinson . After < PROPFIRST > and I divorced , I took back my maiden name , Swanson . < PROPFIRST > was born a Swanson . I should have had my maiden name back When < PROPMALE > Stadler and I divorced , but I wasn't paying attention . 
Everybody on board - Memory Problems - Old Age > memory problems ? Seizure disorder > memory problems ? Brain damage > memory problems ? MS > memory problems . Mom asked what my Seizures felt like - Period . I've been asked what do your seizures look like - I said I didn't know - most people can't see them . 
More than one thing can be going on at a time . Talk Terms : Trauma . Chipped Tooth . \ 
Spiders - nightmares - fear - fearful . Chipped Tooth in 2nd Grade Picture . Pediatrician : Dr. < PROPFIRST > Claussen ( spelling could be wrong ) Since I couldn't think of the questions to ask - right questions to ask - or who to ask - what's the use . In asking . For Truth . 
Songs : Lines from Songs : Everybody's Talking At me I can't hear a word they're saying , only the shadows of my mind . 
++86 : He THOUGHT he was being funny - a comedian - the problem was , he was a plain old General Practictionor - No Neuro Training certainly - No Pysch Training Certainly - even a stopped watch is right twice a day - but to my knowledge , I had never been \diagnosed\ " with \ " Multiple Personalities\ " in 1998 - - he was not qualified to do it either !!!!!! So his name went in the envelope - gave up - and went back to work . " 
Pausing to Say : Happy Birthday to < PROPFIRST > Rajski : 51 years old today - I didn't meet him until after his ( 50 ) day Last year ( but caught the thought up - camera ) Since He met me Last year BEFORE MY birthday ( August 12 will be 50 years old for me ) - 
Honestly - this is the most FUN ( fun ) I've had in years - because since I have no money , can not drive , can not sing the specaial Swanson birthday song mom sang , can't really speak well enough to sound good enough to explain - for his birthday gift , I only had \Inventory\ " to choose from - SO ( serious LAUGH seriously !!!!! ) LOL "
