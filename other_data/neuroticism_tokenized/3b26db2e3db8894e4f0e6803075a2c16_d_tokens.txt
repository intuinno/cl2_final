If we should stay silent . If fear should win our hearts , Our light will have long diminished , Before it reaches the farthest < PROPFEMALE > . * lyric from vnv nation * 
Why do we kill each other in the name of god , government , or revenge ? Why do we hurt each other and then make excuses to justify what we have done ? We call ourselves civilized , but yet we cause so much chaos . 
Who the hell closed down the last blockbust !?!?! Damn netflix and gamefly !

Outlook on life : A complete and utter meaningless joke that you can either laugh about or throw a fit .

Admiral : So tell me again why your doing this ? Me : Um because i want to . Admiral : Whatever man . By the way , don't ever send me a package with an empty box of chocolates in it ever again okay ? 
Admiral : The only reason i like you < PROPFIRST > is because your the only one in this nursing home we call a corp who can take my insults . Now shut up and go shoot up the newbie , he's pissing me off . Me : < PROPMALE > that . I hate you too . 
Me : Hmm Admiral : Oh great now what ? Gonna try another stupid experiment in your real life ? Me : No i was just wondering what would happen if you put plastic wrap over a toilet so that nobody could see it . Admiral : Dude . Your an ass .

I think im to old fashioned . 
Admiral : You wanna know what I think ? Me : No , but no matter what i say your just gonna do what you want . Admiral : I think that you should stick to who you are . I mean if someone has a problem with it , tell em to f**k off and punch em in the face . Me : That would get me suspended . Admiral : So ? 
Admiral : AUGH ! WHAT THE HELL WHERE YOU THINKING !?!?! Me : Hell if i remember . Besides its not my fault your CEO . Admiral : Yeah that means i don't do anything . This is < PROPFEMALE > you idiot , the guys at the top don't need to have any brains . Me : Well at least that means you can run for president now . Admiral : Shut the f**k up 
ugh 
Watched Legion and Battlestar Galactica : The Plan . Today was a great day . 
Admiral : Here's the thing . All of us are just a blip on everyones radar , but depending on the circumstances some blips are usually more impoartant than others .... All i can say is good luck . 
Admiral : If your gonna fail , fail with some style . If your gonna stand up , stand up for what you belive in . If your gonna fight , fight like your gonna die if you dont . And if your gonna live ... well , live life as if your gonna die tomorow . 
I dont want to be human ! I want to see gamma rays , i want to hear x-rays , i want to ... i want to smell dark matter .

I really wish i would stop getting all wacked out during 3rd 
Took a walk just before the sun went down and for some reason im in a great mood . 
DAMN HER !! Why did she have to shoot Adama !!! DX 
Necromorphs are great targets to get pissed off at and vent . 
Admiral : Lets see here . You're crazy , insane , annoying , you have ideas that scare people , and unlike most of us you think outside the box . Me : And thats a bad thing how ? Admiral : Its not . Its just i kept hearing complaints about you asking people to do productive things , and that usually doesn't happen around here . Anyways , log off for twenty minutes so i can talk shit about you . Me : You suck . 
Is going to build a model of a Viper MK II from scratch . 
Is it worth it ? Or should i just back out ? 
Ugh , i took a walk , played Mass Effect and Dead Space for 3 hours , watched 4 episodes of Titan Maximum , and read my book , and i still cant get this out of my head . As soon as i stop doing something or even when i am it just comes back . 
Geeze , if it weren't for my saxophone I don't know what I'd do . 
* sigh * whatever , might as well . Whats the worse that could happen . ( Gonna regret saying that . ) 
forget it . 
disappointed . 
eh whatever . 
Admiral : ? ???????, ??? ?? ???????? ? ???, ??????????? ???????? ???????? Me : Your so lucky i cant read that sh*t . 
Lets see how many people i can piss off in 20 minutes . 
Socialism is the greatest thing invented since the Bicycle . 
Communism is better than capitalism . 
* sigh * plan backfired . 
Watching Caprica . XD Greatest show ever ... well BSG is still better . 
Geeze i might as well as let my parents decide everything for me if i cant even sign myself up for the F**king classes i want . 
In a great mood , gonna do homework and then watch Adama and the crew kick some cylon ass ! XD 
Ugh , every time i see Adama get shot i just wanna cry . 
Admiral : Um okay heres what you do . You tell em to go dig themselves a hole , take a crap in it , and then shoot them selves . Me : Dude .... wtf ? Admiral : Oh did i just say that ? Im sorry . Just tell em where sorry for blowing up their fleet cause they were stupid enough to call us a bunch of useless pr*cks 
Toaster ....

Admiral : DUDE ! I just found twenty bucks in my pocket ! Me : You have a job ? Admiral : Shut the f**k up ! 
Admiral : So let me get this straight . He talked crap about me to you , so you could tell me . Me : Yup . Thats pretty much how it went . Admiral : Damn dude , i thought you had a spine . Me : WHAT ?!!?!?

sometimes i wish i was a centurian . 
Maybe if i watch doctor graystone get his ass beat like a bitch again ill feel better . 
Admiral : Okay this is what you do . Get out of my face , take your head and slam it into the nearest door without getting a concussion ( unless you want one ) and then go sit in front of the TV and vegitate and dont think about anything but what your watching . Me : Do i have to slam my head into the door ? Admiral : Humor me will you . And take video i have to see this . 
What would be great at the end of Mass Effect is if shepard was walking from the wreckage of soverign and slipped fell and broke his neck . That would make for a very anti-climactic ending . 
Okay ... how did radio shack get my damn email ?? 
:/ 
Atari : Hey commander . Me : Hey < PROPFEMALE > . Atari : Why did you < PROPMALE > name me that ? Me : Cause you talk a lot . Atari : I do not talk alot . you just think that because your shy with everyone and the only person you ever talk to is admiral . Hes a jerk anyways and no one cares what he says cause hes rude . Me : Exactly my point . 
just stabbed my gum with my < PROPMALE > and now my < PROPMALE > s broken and im bleeding . 
First my < PROPMALE > stabs me then my metronome breaks ... what next is my saxophone gonna fall out of its stand ? Oh wait it already did ! WTF IS GOING ON !!!!

Well i just found out about the one < PROPMALE > nerve in my leg .... never gonna put my foot on my knee ever again . 
=/ 
Im not paranoid . I've just learned to be wary , to expect the worst , and to not take things lightly . You can go ahead and call it paranoia , but ill just call it being careful . 
Admiral : Hey how about we just have a friend day , you , me the titans and a doomsday device . Me : Uhhh isnt that every day ? Admiral : Im trying to be nice here okay ? I mean geeze do you have to be so condescending ? Me : What ?! You didn't even use that word in the correct context ! Admiral : Psh , fine i ll just go watch a romantic comedy with my girlfriend Admiral has logged off * Me : Oh for fraks sake ! 
Admiral : I think were in trouble . Me : Oh wow really !?!?! I didn't notice ! Its only 43 dreadnoughts 3 supper carriers and a FRAKIN TITAN !!! Admiral : Oh , that ? Psh , we can hot drop those assholes , i was talking about the soup that just blew up in my microwave . Me : Im going to kill you !

Atari : Call me .... Commander . Admiral : Ill call you .... Sasha . Me : HAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHHAA ! 
Admirals Valentines Day Quote : Admiral : Hmmm love ... its like a hot dog , a mix of different things , and the feelings you have for the other person are like the bun that holds everything in place , and how you treat each other are the condiments that make it wonderful . Its amazing isn't it ? Me : You're hungry aren't you ? Admiral : Damn right i am , be right back . 
Admiral : Okay this always helps . Take a bucket any bucket fill it full of ice . Pour some water in there , dunk your head into it and hold yourself there as long as you can , when you come out slam your head into your table 3 times . If your still conscience go to your bathroom and dump the bucket of ice cold water all over yourself , then get changed . Me : Uh , i asked about moons ... not your sunday afternoon . 
Eh could be better . 
Admiral : Alright ! Here's the plan ! Atari run around like a bitch in that wolf of yours and spam local with smack talk . While he's distracting them We're gonna go in for the kill . Me : Said the commander to the 4 man battleship fleet . Admiral : Hey its not my fault its valentines day and everyones with their special someone , now get your asses out their a pump some lead . Atari : * sigh * Were dead :( 
Admiral : So what are you doing for Valentines day atari ? * Atari has logged off * Me : Dude ! You're an asshole ! Admiral : OH SHIT ! Ah f**k you think he's gonna be mad ? Me : No , i bet hes throwin a party right now Admiral : I DO NOT NEED YOUR SARCASM !! 
Admiral : Honestly if I actually cared about all the < PROPFEMALE > little things that happened in life i would probably be sitting in a straight jacket . Seriously man , life is to short to waste it worrying about the small things that are as trivial as ants crawling across your floor , spray em , wipe em up , and throw them away . 
Toast 
Admiral : You're overreacting .. 
I think im gonna play mass effect ... 
is bored and doesnt know what to do . 
Admiral : Ask Sash shes the damn equipment and industrial captain . Me : I did ask her . She was drunk when she built the 40 capital ships . Admiral : Damn how the hell did she do that !?

Admiral : You're as strong as you want to be . You can either choose to grovel or fight back . 
Hahaha ! Horray for tons of coffee and salsa music ! XD 
Admiral : Heres the thing , if your gonna worry about the friggin sh*t people do , then you're just beating yourself up . All you gotta do is forget it and move on . There are always gonna be those who will waste your time , no need fussing about it . Now ... can we please just go POS bashing ?!?!?! 
Me : Hey , why did you pull me into a P Chat ? Admiral : Because ... im gonna tear your crappy empire down and rebuild you into an exact copy of my own . Me : Uhh , okay why ? Admiral : Because i already tried with atari and he started crying . Me : What makes you think i wont ? Admiral : Cause you're the only one i know who can take a 40 minute insult speech . 
GRRR !!! I hate frakin macro miners !! Who cares what CCP says !?! I declare it Macro killing season year round ! 
Admiral : Damn man . How the hell can you do that without punching someone ? Me : No idea , it really sucks . Atari : Ill say , btw why did you ignore my facebook request ? Me : Uh , because i see you < PROPFEMALE > ry single day on < PROPFEMALE > and the fact that i dont want to have a poke war with you . Admiral : I hate him ...

So life's a bitch . What do you want to do , cry about it ? -Starbuck 
Eh , not so suprised . 
Im much more friendlier than i seem . =p 
Admiral : You are gonna take that Naglfar of yours and put it on the front line with its guns . Me : Why me ?? Admiral : Cause if we send atari out there he'll blow up in 5 seconds cause he cant tank a ship to save his life . 
I hate getting nervous about something trivial or seemingly harmless . 
I need to find a way to be less stressed out . 
In government , and in life , the truth is like a copper wire . It can be bent , molded , and fixed to serve the purpose of who is speaking it . 
Wow ... well that was interesting . Logged into my corps ventrillo server to listen to a bunch of heavy accented europeans singing to Freeze by T Pain 
Hahahah ! What is it with my corp and hip hop ?!?! XD 
Cant wait for the next caprica XD 
For the bureaucrat , the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > 
Really wish i had said something , but i didn't 
Ugh , whenever i want to know something its like i have to play splinter cell just to figure out what i want to know . 
Needs to find someone OTHER than < PROPFIRST > that knows about < PROPFEMALE > online 
I hate when i want to talk to someone but i think im just gonna be bothering them if i do .

Gonna watch the fist season of BSG then gonna make quotes that no one knows about .

Just remember , the only person you can rely on is yourself . People can say they got your back , but there's only gonna be a few that will ever pull through . -Admiral 
If you think and act like you're better than everyone else , remember that theres gonna be that one person who's gonna line you up in their sights to take you down . -Admiral 
You are what you are in this world . You're either somebody , or you're nobody . \\nSo say we all 
As i looked at all the relationships around me , some that had gone on forever , some that were reigniting , and some that had just begun . I realized something ... it should have been me . - J.D.

Admiral : Okay , just calm down . Don't do what i did and use a photo copier as a head smashing tool . It does not relieve stress , or make everything feel better or make you feel less worthless . All it does is make your head hurt . \ 
Me : Thanks that was real helpful . How did that pertain to my question at all ? \ 
Admiral : Trust me , when you fail at talking to a girl , thats the first thing your going to want to do . 
Victor : Okay whats the plan !? \

There is no difference between an assault rifle and a pencil . Both can be used as weapons , and if you wanted to you could duct tape a pencil to the rifle and call it a pencil . It is only when placed in the hands of a human and their uses are applied do they become good and evil .

We're the same you and I . We can take as many rounds that a gun can hold and still stand up and fight . They could fire all the artillery in the world at us and still not be able to take us down . But when it comes down to it , we're still bleeding out , and the one thing that can save us seems to slip through our fingers like sand . -Admiral 
=/ I dont know what i should do ... 
Are you impersonating and idiot ? Or are you actually that stupid ? 
Why hello there Mr. Roach ; I'd like you to meet Mrs. Air Soft Gun . I can tell already though that shes going to rip your heart out and then I'm going to have to pick up the pieces .

Six more days till europe trip ! =D 
I used to think war should be abolished from the face of the earth , but now i see that that will never happen and that human ignorance , and intolerance towards each other will never end . But even in the midst of it all , through new ways of killing we seem to find new ways to help each other and ourselves . 
Is dt f**kin over yet ?? 
It pisses me off when people think that their ideologies are so great that they believe they have the right to tear down others just because they don't agree with them . It's selfish , intolerant , and down right stupid .

For some reason i just remembered when i smacked a golf ball right into the engine of the tractor that picks up the balls on the golf range ... sure glad i didnt get it lodged anywhere . 
You see all this ? This so called modern world ; all it is is a make up of metal , plastic , and industrial fibers ruled by greed and corruption . Anyone can say their intentions are good , or that they're a messenger of the divine or whatever , but in the end none of it matters . All it comes down to is what we make of this world , and how we do it . Whether through justice , or ruthlessness . 
It's not that i have a great distrust for people , its just experience has told me different . 
If anyone knows of any good techno artists could you tell me , I'm tired of looking around youtube blindly . Thanks . :) 
I miss Europe =( 
I need a venting partner ... anyone wanna play gears ? 
I frackin hate centipedes

Admiral : So when i woke up this morning , I swear i thought I thought i got everyone to go home . But when i went into the bathroom there was this girl lying on the floor with her face in my cats litter box . \ 
Me : Is it bad that I was somehow able to picture that very vividly ? \ 
Admiral : Idk , how many times have you walked into a bathroom with a girl passed out on the floor ? 
The only reason i woke up today ... spanish project .
