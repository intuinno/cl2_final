< PROPFIRST > just finished his bowl of fruity pebbles and he said Love you mommy ! Thank you for the nice dinner ! What a goof 

Love the nice weather ! Kids jumped on trampoline yesterday and were shouting Summertime ! Summertime ! Took them to the park today to play and then got a strawberry shake afterwards . They are both sleeping on the couch now :) 
< PROPFEMALE > got her first tooth yesterday :) 
Was STARVING so I made myself huge grilled chicken salad . Turned my back for a second and < PROPFIRST > had snatched it off counter and sat down with at table . Turned back around to see my bowl MIA and hear < PROPFIRST > exclaim Oh WOW mommy ! Thank you for the yummy salad ! You are such a good mommy ... 
Put < PROPFEMALE > to bed in < PROPFIRST>'s bed last night ( he was sleeping with < PROPFEMALE > ) . I slept in an extra half hour this morning and when I did wake up I didn't hear < PROPFEMALE > crying ... Immediately went into < PROPFIRST > s room to check on her and she was laying in the bed wide awake .... and < PROPFIRST > was sitting next to her on the bed . He said \Good Morning mommy I was just reading to < PROPFEMALE > and cuddling with her until you woke up \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > took her first ride in a shopping cart today without her carseat ! 
A couple days ago I was helping < PROPFIRST > put his jeans on and he said , \What's that smell ? \ " I asked him what smell . He leaned close to me and started sniffing and he said \ " That's the best smell I've ever smelled ! Your hair smells like < PROPFEMALE > apples . \ " Then he kisses my forehead and tells me he loves me . :) " 
Came in the door and < PROPFEMALE > said , \You're my best friend Gabriel\ " and gives him a big hug . " 
Today when I was helping < PROPFIRST > get dressed he had his hands on my head to steady himself and he said , Oh sorry mommy , I don't want to mess up your hair you already did\ and he puts his hands on my shoulders instead ... How sweet and thoughtful is that ?? "
