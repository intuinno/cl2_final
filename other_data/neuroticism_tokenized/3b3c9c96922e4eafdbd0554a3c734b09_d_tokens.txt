I am writing to ask you all to pray for < PROPFEMALE > & our family . Last night at aro < PROPFEMALE > d 9:30 , while < PROPFEMALE > was at a Yo < PROPFEMALE > g Life f < PROPFEMALE > ction , she felt like she was going to faint . Her body proceeded to go limp & she could not talk , hold her head up or control her body . She said that she was < PROPFEMALE > able to focus & her friends called us . By the time we got her to the ER she was < PROPFEMALE > able do control her body at all . The dr. ' s have are ... 
Dear loving friends & family , Thanks so much for all of your prayers & for the notes . It does mean a lot that people are taking the time to communicate with us . Makes us feel less alone . God is good ! < PROPFEMALE > is now out of the hospital & at home . She has a long way to go , to get back to her normal , but we are doing our best to trust God . \ 
\ 
Thanks for praying & I will keep you all updated ! 
Just a quick update on How < PROPFEMALE > is doing , but first I want to thanks all of you who have been praying for < PROPFEMALE > & our family . Thanks for the notes as well . I have literally gotten notes from all over the USA & the world . It really is amazing to know that God is hearing the petitions for my daughter from all over the the world . So , thanks ! 
So , anyway , here is the update : Tuesday night at about 8:30 < PROPFEMALE > was discharged from Pullman Regional Hospital & we took her home . She was still unable to support her own weight & she could not use either of her hands very well . The doctor's didn't know what was wrong & wanted us to get in touch with Children's hospital in Seattle . 
We talked with her Dr. ( Dr. < PROPFEMALE > Richardson - who is amazing by the way ) Wednesday & we decided that < PROPFEMALE > would be admitted into Children's on Monday morning ( Oct . 25 ) . < PROPFEMALE > is slowly ( very slowly ) improving , but she still can't walk without complete assistance , she gets tired easily & she can't read , because she can't focus . 
Her left hand has improved , but she still can't grip a glass that has liquid in it very well . While at Children's , they will be looking for neurological damage that has not been previously discovered as well as putting her through extensive physical & occupational therapy . 
< PROPFEMALE > is emotionally doing pretty well but is , for obvious reasons , depressed . She is trusting God , but also angry with God . But , God can handle that ! We as a family are doing ok , but it is tough being separated again . 
< PROPMALE > still has school & sports 7 we want to make sure he is not getting forgotten with all this going on . Please keep praying for us . < PROPFEMALE > & I need wisdom . Thanks ! 
... back from Seattle , boy do I miss < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . 
put a fork in me , I'm done ! 
... The darkness has not over come the light ! 
TNF tonight -- < PROPMALE > Hughes on Blessed are the Pure in Heart ! I'm excited !!!!! 
Back in Seattle ! 
Going to the Church on the Ridge tomorrow . 
Am nervous about taking < PROPFEMALE > to Children's tomorrow , please pray for us ! 
Good day today . < PROPFEMALE > is admitted , we have met with her team of Dr. ' s , Nurses & Therapists & feel really good about it all . May God intervene & heal < PROPFEMALE > ! Praise His name !!!!! 
God is good , but His goodness is not based upon my Circumstances . Nor is it based upon how people who say they follow Him act . It is just true , all the time ! 
... is home for the week . 
TNF Tonight ! 
Back in Seattle with < PROPFEMALE > for the week . Not much of a Thanksgiving this year .
