So , if a mockingbird sings and noone hears it , was it a waste of time ? 
So we're reading To Kill A Mockingbird in english and I swear , I never thought 9th graders could act so stupid ! Yes , the beginning is a little dense , but it's not that hard to figure out ! You HAVE to pay attention to what Scout says ! It makes me feel dumb that I understand everything she means and I'm one of the very very few in my class . Or does that mean that 9th graders are JUST THAT LAZY ??? 
going to bed ... the person I really want to talk to isnt on here :'( good night 
I just realized .... i miss him so much :( its such a terrible feeling 
You know , my dad always used to tell me that the leaves would turn over when it was gonna rain ..... i actually started looking and never saw it happen . Now i just realize he was being stupid .... after all those years of watching leaves .... thanks dad :P

What's worse than < PROPFEMALE > Montana ? < PROPFEMALE > Montana when she writes her own songs .

from the ice inside your soul\ 
don’t come back for me\ 
who do you think you are ?

The shadow within me , the sorrow at my feet , gonna lead the revival , no simple survival for me . 
I'm so mad at myself for cheating today . ): How could I do that ? My soul is impure now . )': In english we had a vocabulary test and I helped this girl who sits by me get a few answers . I am the scum of the earth . </3 
Got everything done that I was supposed to get done . < PROPMALE > is in bed , the house ( and my room ) are clean , laundry is done , dinner is in the fridge , and I'm showered and sooooooooo ready for bed . Goodnight world . (:

I was toying with my hair because I'm bored . Now I have a new hairstyle , and this time it didn't involve scissors ! :D Now I can cover up the bad job I did with my bangs LAST time . :P 
My last status lied and said my new hairstyle didn't invovle scissors , not even 10 mins . after I posted that I chopped about half my hair off . :\\ 
For all who said the wanted to see my new haircut , go into my \Random Stuffs\ " album in my photots they should be the last 3 pictures (: " 
Does blogging count as a form of therapy ? O.o 
;; And the rain will kill us all . Throw ourselves against the wall . But no one else can see . The preservation of the martyr in me . ;; 
Parent teacher conferences . :P I'm afraid . 
Parent teacher conferences went okay . All A's ... Except for one . English . I have a B . I feel like crying myself to sleep . I've worked so hard and this is what I've amounted to . With these grades what college would want me ? If I keep this up my future is ruined . )': 
;; A light to burn all the empires . So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be . In love with all of these vampires . So you can leave like the sane abandoned me . ;; 
Waiting for my phone to ring . 
Okay why the heck can't I download Windows Movie Maker ???? >:(

Texting-ish a friend and over-replaying the video I posted . Need a new catchphrase ... \true that\ " is getting old . Lol . " 
The cold makes me want to knock on my mom's door , tell her I'm sick , and crawl back into bed for an afternoon of sleep . 
It makes me want to cry that Ich Liebe Dich is NOT by Tokio Hotel )': 
I'm sick . :\\ 
D: I'm sick but I can't even miss school tomorrow cause of that stupid ACT Practice test thingy tomorrowwwwwwwwww !!!!!!!!!!! :\\ 
I'm tired of waiting for this newbie on Google to make his freaking 15 minute move on scrabble . It's not that hard to make a freaking word ! It's 109 points to 52 and I'm winning . He keeps making dumb words like OE and < PROPFEMALE > . What is that ? Make a real word . 
It makes me sad that talk about it quite alot but nobody coud actually tell me what my favorite movie is ): 
GOSH !! DON'T BE SUCH AN AFRO TRISCUIT !! 
My brain hurts . Can't wait for saturday . Need more pictures (:

I'm sorry to all those I scared today with my mood swings . I am much MUCH calmer now that I'm home . :D Yay ! 
I wrote a poem this morning . It's to all of you people who spend 50 minutes every morning caking orange makeup on your face , who decide to prance around in an obscene attire , who lie about life ... this is to you . I hate you . Read it , absorb it , learn it , realize it , live by it . 
I'm not ashamed of my life anymore ... because no longer is it empty . (: 
Oh you make me wanna get up to sing and dance to our favorite songs :D

Normally I don't post statuses about the rest of my day , just the present ... but man , I just had the most awesome day with < PROPFIRST > And < PROPFEMALE > :D ? 
;; Everyday I sit and ask myself , how did love slip away . Something whispers in my ear and says . You are not alone . I am here with you . Though you're far away , I am here to stay . You are not alone , for I am here with you . Though we're far apart , you're always in my heart . And you are not alone . ;; Love you MJ ! ?

I feel horrible about earlier and I'm not even sure whats going on . I keep wondering ... why can't you talk to me about it ? Am I the reason for it so that's why you won't tell me ? Or do you just not trust me enough ? I guess I should understand . But I can't help but be paranoid , it's in my nature ... I can't believe I'm almost in tears because of it . ): 
You have one < PROPMALE > to ask me anything i can not lie ( message only ) .... Make this your status to see the weird questions . ( Why not ? I'm bored ) :\\ 
One minute I was sitting on the couch thinking , next thing I know I'm waking up from a long nap . Don't remember what I was thinking about , but I am pretty sure I just bored myself to sleep > < 
Every night she walks right in my dreams , since I met her from the start . I'm so proud I am the only one , who is special in her heart . The girl is mine . The doggone girl is mine . :D ? 
Omgosh this stupid facebook like thingy describes me perfect D: \I'm afraid that I'm the friend that everyone secretly hates . The one that's annoying . The one that no one likes . The one that is totally oblivious . The one that everyone talks about when they're not around . I'm afraid that I don't have any friends . \ " )': " 
I get to see my darling today (: Yayface ! Making < PROPMALE > lunch . Sometimes you meet those people and they make you wish you weren't a pacifist . 
You know you have no life when you get up super early just to see what OTHER people are doing on Facebook at 6:30 in the morning > < 
Going to Court's with < PROPFEMALE > and such . (: It's so amazing that I love you when I didn't think I was capable of such a thing . ?

I'm fine people . I just need time . It just seems that until I've had enough time to be okay everything has to go wrong . How am I supposed to keep everyone else around me cheerful and happy if I can't even seem to figure out how to be happy myself ? I feel sick . ): 
Just saw the fb link : \Whoever started that RIP < PROPFIRST > Beiber rumor is sick . It's not right to get people's hopes up like that . \ " That's got to be the best ever . xD " 
New default yay ! :D MJ <3

From all the truth that I've said . \ 
Come by it honestly I swear\

Gping to play WoW . I'm hungry :/ If a dinosaur and giraffe get in a battle , the dinosaur will win . Trust me . The giraffe needed to be superglued back together afterwards . >.< 
Every time I wear make-up to make my face look paler , my friends tell me I finally have some color in my face ! FML 
Currently learning the words to Durch De Monsun by Tokio Hotel :D It's funny when I mess up ! ( which is very often ) xD 
i was gonna do a song quote .. then I remembered the generation I'm talking to >.< Nobody ever listens to 80's music anymore ! It's such a shame ! It's so amazing ! better than nowaday's music for sure ! 
;; Now she found herself in the fast , < PROPFIRST > livin ' day to day\ 
Turned her back on her best friends , And watched the family slip away\ 
Just like a lost soul , caught up in the Hollywood scene\ 
All the parties and the limousines\ 
Such a good actress hiding all her pain\ 
Trading her memories for fortune and fame\ 
Just a step away from the edge of a fall\ 
Caught between heaven and hell , Where's the girl I knew a year ago ;; 
Well then FB , I think I'm going to get off now .. and think about today .. and the awesome chocolate cake < PROPFEMALE > made me eat :D ( it was yummy ) I want handmade marble ! :D lol

I'd like to get to kow you more (:

Madface ! I gots a layout for my profile .. but it totally messed up the whole profile ): The layout was good and all but it screwed up my posts and everything D ' : Who would do such a thing ? Let's just say I'm never trying that again -_-' 
Just got up from a very long nap :/ Now it's time to do some dishes . >.< 
If I know you aren't going to get on Facebook , why do I keep waiting around ? 
Yep . It's time to dye my mommy's hair . Now I can see what she is about to do to me when she dyes MY hair ! Can't wait (: Hopefully if she lets me go we can go to Walmart and pick up my hair color tomorrow . But first things first ... I need to get my hair cut . Next week maybe ? :D No longer will I be Strawberry Blonde ! WOO ! 
Let's paint the sky red (: We'll use your blood :D You don't need it anyways . 
For once in a long time , I can say that I am fine . (: 
What a nice day today . I actually might get dressed today xD 
I cry everytime I have time I have to vaccuum up all the dead tree buggies that die right in front of my front door . It's like telling them thier afterlife is gonna suck . ): 
Emotional breakdown ? Yep . I think so . 
I love my friends . So much . I may have only a few friends in Camden , but I'll never forget the special friends I made in my past (: My love goes to my closest friends and my unbiological siblings . ? Blood may be thicker than water , but it's not the relativity that matters ; It's the memories , bond , and love that matters . You are special to me . ? 
How could I live without you ? (: ? 
I'm tired of dreaming . All it does is instill even more fear in my heart . 
Great . I finally think I've made a new friend in Camden and he finds out today that he is moving . Wonderful . Hopefully we can still play WoW . )': Guess we're not hanging out today ... 
Freaking blueberry . >:/ 
Yay I'm actually excited about school this morning (: ? I can finally say that I barely feel sick anymore :D 
Had an okay day . Hopefully it gets better . :/ 
What was supposed to be a productive day turned into a very very lazy day . With dreams of < PROPFIRST > Shatner . What is going on ? 
Don't feel good . Today go fast please . More insane dreams about < PROPFIRST > Shatner last night . What is this about ? Also I dreamt that I was in a game . Save a mental patient from killing herself and get her back to the mental < PROPMALE > = 20 points . I went swimming and < PROPFIRST > Shatner told me to stop fooling around and to get back on his < PROPFEMALE > Trek ship . Yea , I for sure prefer these bizzare dreams over my constant nightmares . 
Making dinner (: ? 
Wow . It's going to be below freezing all of tonight and all of tomorrow . :/ 
I was kinda myself for the very first time around her ... She said scared I her xD lol\ 
No surprise . I'm a scary person . Kinda wish I was someone else , maybe I wouldn't freak everyone out all the time . I can't help that I like dead bodies , and I can't help that I am interested in serial killers . It's my thing . Deal . 
I was kinda myself for the very first time around her ... she said I scared her ... lol xD\ 
No surprise . I'm a scary person . I wish I was someone else sometimes , maybe I wouldn't freak everybody out then ... I can't help that I like dead bodies and I can't help that serial killers interest me . I like death . Deal . 
Yep ... Just waiting ... and waiting . 
I feel sick today :/ Oh well . At least I only have to suffer through 1-5 hour and 20 minutes of 6th hour :P Bleh . 
Don't worry , I'll help you find your < PROPFIRST > of sunshine in this lonely , shadowed world (: 
Can't decide whether today is going to be a good day or not yet . 
There is a certain someone at my house and we are destined to be best friends (: ? 
Last night was so much fun (: Kinda feel bad for falling asleep at 8 A.M. though >.< Thanks for making me a Blood Elf (: ? She's pretty . 
If feelings were real you would throw them in my face . 
Thjs morning right before my alarm clock decided to startle me awake , it told me that I can't have my cake and eat it too . Why would my alarm clock tell me that ? Alarm clocks have minds of their own ... 
My presentation is today :D ? I hope 
< PROPMALE > Esparza is a meanie pants because he lied and said he doesn't speak spanish when he actually DOES ): I feel so blonde for believing you >.< 
Going to Court's in a bit to work on my project (: Thanks Court . Today was ... okay I guess . 
I just realized something about myself ... and I don't like it ... not one bit . 
Had another awful dream . Don't think I'll be talking much today . 
I watched Halloween 2007 with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > today . Man I cannot describe how much I've missed seeing < PROPFIRST > stab and choke people . I love you < PROPFIRST > . ? 
I have a feeling this half day of school will feel longer than a normal one . :/ 
Just showed my momthe son Friday by < PROPFEMALE > Black . You should've seen her face of absolute horror . xD haha 
Just showed my mom the song Friday by < PROPFEMALE > Black . You should've seen her face of absolute horror . xD haha 
Oh sheeshers , parent teacher conferences with my momma . Only seeing < PROPFIRST>'s teachers though . My teahers probably couldn't be happier . 
Haha had a fun time with Court (: We decided we're making a collaberation video during Spring Break . Awesomeness . Also ... \I be acting like I'm smart . Pass me a book ! \ " HAHA xD GloZell we show much love ? Now ... for cleaning :P Peace out FB ! " 
Tonight is not good . At all . Straightened up the house and it still looks like a mess . Why can't I ever do anything good enough ? I try and try and never get anywhere . Whatever . I'm gonna draw . That probably won't be any good either . Ended up with one B on my report card again . Why can't I get all A's ? Why can't I just relax for once ? For Mother Nature's sake I'm on Spring Break !!! 
Had a great time with Court and < PROPFIRST > (: We gotta do it again sometime (: 
I want to see my grandpa and grandma ): I miss you guys and love you ? 
Just got done drawing . I'll put a picture up when I get my camera back :P

I can't seem to find something to do :/ 
So ... my mom told me to get up early so we could clean the house ... it's 9 and I'm the only one up . Wtf ? Might as well get a head start . >.< 
Spent 3 hours cleaning and organizing < PROPMALE>'s room . IT BETTER STAY THAT WAY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY !! (: Or else I will cry . Cleaned the entire house from ceiling to floor and man am I tired ! Stupid 5 hour energy didn't even last that long ! Hopefully < PROPFIRST > is coming over later (: I need a coffee break >.< 
Make-up is finally done .. It only took like an HOUR :P But it looks sweet so it's all good (: 
Stitching up your wounds with my heartstrings ... 
Just finished watching < PROPMALE > Potter and The Half Blood < PROPMALE > . I . Almost . Cried . I can't whine about any parts in particular in case someone hasn't seen it yet ... but I really wish this series would never end . ): Why ? Why J.K Rowling ? Why are you going to end the greatest movie and book series of all time ? Sometimes I feel like I need Hogwarts to live . Don't kill me . Please . 
Seven ... seven ... seven ... my mother must read my newest story . (: 
Gonna start drawing soon :D 
< PROPMALE > is sitting at his table in his tent eating apple crisps and watching < PROPMALE > . How cute . :3 Reminds me of me when I was little . Except , I would watch < PROPFEMALE > , not < PROPMALE > . 
I want to be able to scream like < PROPMALE > from Mushroomhead !! Especially like he does in Solitaire Unraveling . :3 I wish . (: 
AHH I can't get < PROPMALE > Potter out of my head !! Acually , not < PROPMALE > , but Snape . Man , I read something I shouldn't have online and now I am afraid to watch the last 2 movies because it's gonna crush me . ): I hope school distracts me . It hurts my soul . 
You're the most confusing person in the whole world !! 
I'm tired but I don't want to sleep ! 
I hope today goes fast because it's only 6:30 and I already need a nap !! ): 
Had a great day today . Now , wish me luck on getting some sleep tonight . Please . 
;; Chop , chop , chop you up . Ima monster ! Hahaha ! Eat you like a cannibal . Spit you out like an animal . ;; 
So ... I had a great day . (: 
Did some make-up stuffs . But it didn't turn out half as good as I wanted it to ): It looks okay , it's just not what I wanted . I need white make-up so I can hide those stupid freckles !!! >:( Grr . 
What started out as a good day ... turned bad in 2.5 . Thanks a bunch . Apparently I wasn't freaking clear the first time ... 
Watched some more Blood+ . Feeling the need to watch < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 . Merff life . Had a bad day today . A certain someone ruined my day completely , but you know what ? Tomorrow is a new day and I won't care at all . Getting my hair done soon . Can't wait to show everyone tomorrow . Is this status too long ? Merff . 
Hair is done . Can't wait to show < PROPFIRST > :DD
