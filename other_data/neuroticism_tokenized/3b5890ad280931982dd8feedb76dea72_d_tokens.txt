I'm not afraid to take a stand\ 
Everybody come take my hand\ 
We'll walk this road together , through the storm\ 
Whatever weather , cold or warm\ 
Just let you know that , you're not alone\ 
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road\ 
And I just can't keep living this way\ 
So starting today , I'm breaking out of this cage\ 
I'm standing up , Imma face my demons\ 
I'm manning up , Imma hold my ground 
with ry guy for a bit then back at the house to sand my walls .... 
Forever young i wana be forever young do you really wana live forever forever forever 
Let us die young , or let us live forever .. We don't have the power , but we never say never ... sitting in a sandpit , life is a short trip ... the music's for the sad man .... 
Wit ry brit ( goons ) lol n < PROPFEMALE > at the fair 
In the cape for the weekend !! 
... 
Fear not where , fear not why , fear not much while we're alive\ 
Life is for living not living uptight\ 
til you're somewhere up in the sky\ 
Fear not die I'll be alive for a million years bye bye's are not for legends i'm forever young my name shall survive 
Ok I saw you at the bus stop \ 
You had on a haulter top \ 
And your mini skirt \ 
And your doony in your purse \ 
So I turn around and swoop you \ 
And hit you with that toot toot

Around the house then ... who knows !!

Every < PROPFEMALE > has its thorn\ 
Just like every night has its dawn\ 
Just like every cowboy sings his sad , sad song\ 
Every < PROPFEMALE > has its thorn 
With brit chylln !! i hate the rain ! 
I may not be the worst or the best , \ 
But you gotta respect my honesty , \ 
And I may break your heart , \ 
But I don't really think theres anyone as bomb as me , \ 
So take this chance , \ 
In the end everyone's gonna be wondering how you deal !!!! 
Conference call 
Where'd you go I miss you so , seems like its been forever , that you've been gone ..... Pleazz come bak home !! 
FML ! FNB !! 
Tell me wut do you see when your lookin at me ... On a mission to be wut im destine to be ... I done been through the pain and the struggle its nithin but love ... 
So , We don't need your education\ 
We don't want no pacifier\ 
We are the leaders of your nation\ 
We're gonna make sure the world survives\ 
There ain't no justice there's just us\ 
What happened to the meaning of \in God we trust\ " \ 
And suddenly I become a part of your past\ 
I'm becoming the part that don't last\ 
I'm losing you and its effortless\ 
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground\ 
In the throw around\ 
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down\ 
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves 
Me and my homies stay tight like a noose \ 
And if you step to one of us you betta step to the whole crew \ 
I never knew that I could depend \ 
That I could have some friends that's down til the very end \ 
Well that's my home boys , excuse me , my family \ 
And when we conquer the world \ 
We macking on the galaxy cause skys ain't limited \ 
And we ain't finished \ 
And if my homies gonna ride ya know I'm with it 
Finally passing out 
With ry guy 
Bed

I can't tell you what it is , I can only tell you what it feels like . \ 
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe .. \ 
I can't breath but I still fight while I can fight .. \ 
As long as the wrong feels right I'm in flight .. 
gettn ready then out and about with ry guy !!! 
And shepherds we shall be , \ 
For Thee , my Lord , for Thee . \ 
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand , \ 
That our feet may swiftly < PROPFEMALE > out Thy command . \ 
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee\ 
And teeming with souls shall it ever be . \ 
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti . 
Out and about no GTL avoiding mtv !!!!
