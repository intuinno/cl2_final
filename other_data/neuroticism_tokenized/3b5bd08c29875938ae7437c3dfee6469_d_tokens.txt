Dear Tea Party , \ 
You are not a real party , you don't have any radically different political views that deserves recognition . You are just afraid to grow up and live in the 21st century United States . Get over it . If one more of you wins a primary I might kill myself .... or move to Canada . Maybe both . Please stop ... just stop ... forever . Thanks ! \
