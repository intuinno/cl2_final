is finally listening to < PROPFEMALE > and my sister and is going to TRY and rest ... I <3 you both :] 
fever finally broke sometime last night ... which means I don't have to go to the doc ( in my mind @ least ) . I went from like almost 103 down to around 100 today , & so far I don't feel like I'm having unusual chills today-so far @ least ! 
is going to the doc @ 3:30 ( or really some nurse chick ) , but mainly decided to so I could make sure I could return to work since the fever complicates things (& yes there is a 24 hour fever rule according to the nurse hotline lady ) ... so fine fine , you guys won-too bad I can't make you pay the huge < PROPMALE > I'm going to have now 
so I got approved to go to work tomorrow , & went ahead & asked about what she thought for my weight range , & she said anywhere within the 120s was fine so YAY for both ! & my blood pressue was a bit low but it was normal for my age :)
