Snapple real fact #108 : Tehcuhs are indigenous to Africa 
You know you have a problem when you complete surveys to get premium cash for a facebook game X ____ X 
Got my new kitten Nyoko ^___^ 
Supernatural's 100th episode tomorrow , nya . Nyoko and I are < PROPFEMALE > excited ! 
I believe in the YES 
It says something when your legs are freezing to death in shorts yet youre too lazy to get up and change into pants #___ # 
I cut my bangs myself ( with a little help ) and they actually look really cute ! ^ w ^ 
i finally hit gold in pet society . Instead of giving me the lowest or second lowest amount they can on the initial spin , i actually got 2000 ! > w < 
Ah the trial of courage set before me ; being alone in the house with a scary bug and forced to kill it without the assistance of brother . < PROPFIRST > be proud ! =( ^ w ^) = 
$1 = ¥93 ( just about ) 
Downloading music . Was FINALLY able to find the song that was unavailable on limewire ... LIMEWIRE = GAY 
I was editing another photo for facebook using this one website and it is the SECOND time i had to cancel it bc it decided not to respond as it was saving -__- 
Nyoko decides to mew agressively at me , employing the full force of those little pleading eyes , as i have food . Then when i give her a piece ( everytime ) she decides to batt it around with her paws and play with it . -__- ... you'd think i'd learn because it just happened again ! 
I wish i could just speak like a normal person , instead of having words stumble awkwardly out of my mouth ... 
Am i the only one who feels extremely violated and disturbed after getting an examination from the doctor :O 
rape 
thats what i do to them boyscouts ;) 
Boats and hoes ;3 
Just so everyone knows ... if you were offended by a friend/secret thingy that was by me .. avert your anger ! Twas Jhane Cummings !! 
Making chili . Ugh you motivated me < PROPFIRST > , you really did , and yes i will TRY to bring some in tomorrow but i dont know how this is happening . I hate cutting onions ! I cry everytime ! 
... My chili is ruined ... * collapses theatrically and wails into hands * 
So on the Advanced Anime website they are holding a contest to pick the best anime drawing , revolving around a theme i guess expressed in a song/lyrics . So i have been improving my ability to draw in the anime/manga style but still am not too confident .. but after seeing some of the entries already in .. i think i could probably win it .. ( oh yeah final entries do not have to be in cg or anything so i'm good there :3 ) 
Goodnight everyone ... * yawns * 
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping \ 
While my guitar gently weeps \ 
I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping \ 
Still my guitar gently weeps \ 
... 
I'll never understand people ... 
If only i knew what i was getting into later in life , maybe i'd appreciate my childhood a bit more for what it was .. or maybe being so carefree as to not scrutinize every situation is really what childhood was all about , NOT realizing the dismal threshold we stood upon and soon would step into , ... and why we look back upon those years so fondly , so enviously ... 
Ow ow ow i just burnt my tounge drinking hot tea ! It hurts ! 
Oooh let me just write this paper .. * begins swaying dramatically while writing * Oh ! And look ! A dog with no neck is running this way ! It must be serious ! 
May 13 , 2010 ... the cataclysmic day that ended my world , devoured my heart .. and killed something crucial inside of me ,... and it's times like these with nothing but the memory of it to reflect upon that i realize i will never recover .. that that fragment of my life will never be revived ... 
Supernatural New episodes of Supernatural return Fridays this \ 
Fall , as well as new shows < PROPFEMALE > , Hellcats , and Plain < PROPFEMALE > . OMJPS I WAS TOO SCARED TO LOOK IT UP BUT NOW EVIDENCE HAS COME TO ME !!! * glows with happiness * ^___^

Mirror , mirror\ 
Reflect my grotesque mind\ 
Mirror , oh mirror , \ 
Who’s the most beautiful on earth ?

Man , is anyone else as tired as i am ? 
Wondering if i should do my hair ESPECIALLY crazy for tonight ... 
Tonight was so fun , hanging with Jhane , Court , and the rest ! ^___^

I made cake ! 
Okay honestly .. would anyone , if the situation presented itself , watch someone else undress secretly !? lmao !

So .. am i the only one who never associated Gingerale with the spice < PROPFEMALE > at all ? .. I recently found that my < PROPFEMALE > ale is made with < PROPFEMALE > ...? Lol how weird ! How do they do that !?!?! 
Another additional value of the pogo tribe ; do not tag friends ' photos on facebook if they look .. hmm .. unappealing in them . >.< 
Hoagie fest ! Oiishi ! ^___^ 
Can't wait for shojou shikake no libretto ! 
Oh , but i have finally gazed upon those exit doors with the knowledge and satisfacton that it would be the last time i would ever do so .. for a couple of months anyway ;3 
I made black bean salsa everyone ! I am really impressed with how it turned out ! If anyone wants to know Tehcuh's secret recipe , here it is ;3 :\ 
Tomatoes , diced ( how many depends on who's eating , 1-2)\ 
Half can of corn ( drained)\ 
Half can of black beans ( drained ) \ 
about 1 onion , minced\ 
1 pepper ( i used orange *___* )\ 
4 capfuls of balsamic vinegar\ 
couple pinches of cumin ( about 1/2- 1 teaspoon)\ 
salt and pepper 
The inconsideration of people astounds me ;\ 
I stand in front of a hot stove , preparing both sweet potato fries and boiled carrots to mash and apparently that isn't enough , I have to make the porkchops of which i've no experience or < PROPFEMALE > in making as well . While my mother was SUPPOSED to make them ! Gah ! So frustrated !

Ah , Happy Forth of July everyone ! *___* \ 
Me and Nyoko are still scared everytime a firework goes off , despite the occasion . \ 
Oh < PROPMALE > , How i wish i could gaze at your lips as the firelight glances off of them , Heaven deserves the display of your parted lips , teeth dazzling beneath them like stars alive , more than every sky-shattering burst of light that this event concedes . Oh ! * sways as if beginning to faint *

Happy birthday < PROPMALE > Padalecki ! \ 
What a sacred day this is , to celebrate the birth of such a beautiful person ... I love you ! ^___^ 
I have finally got around to officially celebrating < PROPMALE>'s birthday ( Belated now ) ... i feel shame to have waited so long ! But his cake has been baked , as a token of my love for him and in best wishes for a happy year ( Life ! ) and a happy marriage with < PROPFEMALE > ... And as i enjoy it's decadence , my lips will linger on the cake , imagining his blessed lips consuming my happiness for him just as i consume this food .. 
Came up with a really extra yummy dip recipe ! n___n 
Madame Bovary is so horrible ! I will get through it though ! * dedicated look * 
Maybe oneday you'll gain some wisdom , and humility , and finally realize that you're not above Judgment from others . 
Supernatural re-run ! * w * 
Some people do not deserve to raise children . And it breaks my heart that i can't do much of anything about it . 
* in a voice strained with exhuastion , Tehcuh matsui declares , * Jhane Cummings , or better known as The Whore of Babylon , i will condescend to such Savage behaviour to SMACK YOU ABOUT THE FACE , if you continue ' poking ' me ! Do not provoke me ! 
I , Tehcuh Matsui , have an announcement : I have made delicious Kool-Aid ( lol had to look at the packet to gt spelling ;3 ) for the first time last night ! I must say that i am swelling with pride at it's quality , not too sweet or watery . I don't usually drink it but it's flavor is absolutely delightful ... and having non-carbonated drinks ( and REAL sugar ) every once in a while does have it's perks ... no headaches ! ^ w ^ 
Everyone invited to the Jailbreak event should be sure to contact someone ( My lovely assistant Jhane Cummings , the whore of Babylon for example .. * Jhane makes a gesture of acknowledgment , and continues with her whorish activities * in regard to it . To .. RSVP .. i guess . \ 
If anyone who was not invited wants to come and can be at ' The park ' tomorrow by 4:30 -ish .. feel free to invite yourself . :3 
I made steaks , butter-herb potatoes and green beans for dinner tonight ! :D 
Cute-plush.com! * swells with kawaiity*\ 
Also ! Busy day tomorrow ! Hopefully i'll be able to stop at the library to download the new Kanon Wakeshima album that i've been dying to have : Lolitawork Libretto ! 
Saturday , I am going shopping again to get the rest of my stuff ( Jhane , those Pastry shoes weren't in finishline or footlocker or whatever when we went to the Voorhees town center ... Going to deptford to see if they have any there ) ... Perhaps if maybe one certain WHORE OF BABYLON would accompany me to the library as well , i could finally download Lolitawork libretto ! 
Didn't get pastries :( \ 
Got osiris shoes instead ... now if only i could lace them XD 
O.O \ 
School . ... this is absolute sh ** , haha 
At the library with Jhane Cummings , < PROPFIRST > Henderson , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and Najir Anekwe 
Today was okay ... fell asleep at < PROPFIRST>'s house , lol ( I apologize , whore of Babylon ) and walked home through the ghetto of pinehill ... Scary ! O.O 
Oh ! To dance upon the thought of sunday morning , and be reminded of the forthcoming day , despaired with the knowledge of school starting promptly at 7:00 am ... the tragedy of it mirrors the universal struggle to maintain happiness in a world governed by misery . I lament ! But it is in his lips , flesh puckered sweetly o ... ver , challenging the very beauty of life itself in it's comparison ., that i seek solace . 
I am indebted to both Mr. Najir Anekwe for buying me a stuffed unicorn that i love\ 
( * w * )\ 
and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > for using her buy-one-get-one-free on me for a super-kawaii wallet ! ^^\ 
Thanks so much guys ... \ 
( OH , and let us not forget an honorable mention in the name of The Whore of Babylon , for paying for the ride there ^____^ ) 
' Is that a rat's nest on your head ? ' * Laughs in pride of imaginary wit*\ 
' Yes it is infact , i will now formally introduce you to marmalade . ' * Pulls rat out of hair*\ 
' O.O ' \ 
.... Inspired by < PROPFEMALE>'s experiences ^^ 
\Rape would occur \"" 
' Tearing up ' some gerber graduates ^-^ \ 
... oiishii ! :D 
I wake to sleep , and take my waking slow 
Haha ! I mispelled google , and so in the search bar was , ' Google.cm ' ... and what came up was really neat ! Try it ! 
Kya , at the library with Jhane Cummings and < PROPFIRST > Henderson , who is sleeping over ! ^__^ 
Such a fun day ! Went to the library and the mall .. ah ! How funny , the things we fell into ! Again , ... great day ! < PROPFIRST>'s sleeping over now , .. don't expect sleep tonight , sweet family of mine ! Though some specific members of said family , frankly , i care not of their condition . At the moment , anyway . Goodnight , everyone , until tomorrow . ^^ 
Um , don't give me dirty looks when you're inside MY house . Whatever judgements you make , you can keep off your face or i will come over there and smack that snotty little expression right off of it . 
SUPERNATURAL SEASON 6 PREMIER ! =( ^ w ^) = 
I so desperately want a new carpet for my bedroom ! Supernatural tonight ! ^^ 
So , i just yelled ' Let me do it my way ' exasperatedly ( .. word ? lol ) to my mom as she comes in with groceries and must have sounded really mean and childish .. as my sister had friends over ... in the other room with the door open .. fml x__x 
' Hamlet loves me no more!' 
But in her web she still delights/ \ 
To weave the mirror's magic sights , / \ 
For often through the silent nights/ \ 
A funeral , with plumes and lights/ \ 
And music , went to Camelot ;/ \ 
Or when the < PROPFEMALE > was overhead , / \ 
Came two young lovers lately wed . / \ 
\I am half sick of shadows 
Gah !

Procrastination is a snake that seduces you and then comes back around to bite you in the ass ... =___= 
Totally blowing off homework for DDO , lol , .. but hey , that's what lunch is for ... ;3 
Don't you wish that you could wear costumes whenever you wanted and it didn't have to be completely abnormal ? That people wouldn't make fun of you ? Oh ! But if i were in JAPAN , it would be different ! How my heart yearns to go there ! 
Doubt thou the stars are fire \ 
Doubt thou the sun doth move\ 
Doubt truth to be a liar \ 
But never doubt I love 
Gah ! Why is it that i am destined to keep missing my show ?! I fall asleep in the afternoon and wake up perfectly right after it goes off ! 
I hate this so much , why is it always me who has to act prim and fucking perfect just to have but an once of respect back . Some people are so selfish it really revolts me : i ask for something just so some little bitch in my highschool doesnt come to my house and apparently that's too much ! 
Why to i have to feel uncomfortable in my own house just to the pleasure of my stupid , irresponsible , piece of shit sister who's now .. what , 23 ? ... pregnant , and can't support her own family ? She can't take care to ensure the proper welfare of her children because she's too busy worrying about her social life and tending to affairs of the household in which she has no place . 
It is so hurtful to contemplate this : I work so hard to try and improve myself , to make myself a person who can set a decent example for children and ensure their physical safety and mental wellness when i wish to raise one . However there are so many people who couldn't give a second thought to how theyre impacting HUMAN LIVES , for the very lack of importance it holds to them . 
Why am i the only one who ever gets hurt ? Why am i always wrong in every situation . 
I have a piece of rice lodged in my throat . Who knew it was so dangerous to eat soup ...? 
I've been procrastinating all day . Time to do that- Oh ! I will simply look toward the waning < PROPFEMALE > , and recall the ethereal beauty of < PROPMALE>'s lips .. flesh pulled taute in a delicate arch as petals of a < PROPFEMALE > , glistening with dew upon their cheeks , curve inward toward their breast . Swelling , sweetly glazed with the ambrosia of his ou t-t urned tounge , they beckon me closer to taste the confection that they promise .. 
Missing my beloveds to see Paranormal activity2 with my buds . Oh ! I've wronged you < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ! But my love for you does not wane i assure you ! 
Today sucked ... 
Oh that's very logical , let me pick you up barely 40 minutes before school lets out so that the entire purpose of getting let out has been defeated . I am so pissed right now ... 
Cutting my hair again everyone ! Now i can style my hair as usual ! ... < ( * 3 *) > 
I would murder for some goobers right now ! 
New favorite song : Gardenia - Malice Mizer 
* whispers creepily * ... You can be a wizard ... 
Among the sun's pale rays glistening you stop and turn to me\ 
And look on curiously at the flower I'm holding\ 
Where you to take in your hand , and draw it to your chest you'd see\ 
The flower blossoms to match your beauty\ 
Gardenia ... my sweet darling , deep in your cherib's eyes I see\ 
Everything I ever held dear to me\ 
I'll take you somewhere new with me , and together we'll always be\ 
Enfolded in my arms so gently ... 
Like this and thou shall receive a reading from the mystical , all-seeing Tehcuh Matsui .. Soothsayer in the making ! 
Happy birthday brother ! ^___^ 
Oh delicious chocolate cake , you nourish my SOUL .. * creepiily whispers and licks lips * 
I seriously do NOT want to go to school tomorrow . 
I have no human nature . 
I <3 Encyclopedia dramatica ... \

In his house at R'lyeh , dead Cthulhu waits dreaming ... 
Step up , get your rotten flesh ! \ 
On the finest corpse decayed ! \ 
Cerebral fluid , guaranteed fresh ! \ 
A zombie's finest marmalade . \ 
Puddings-blood and bladders finest ! \ 
Pickled tounge , eyeballs glazed ! \ 
Can be hard for one to di-gest\ 
But will leave you amazed ! 
<3 Kazuuuukiii ! <3 
A light fills the < PROPFEMALE > of the Starry Sky , \ 
the shadow born from it is a Life from Hell . 
A stacatto of meaningless chords , nurtured by the delicate tremor of the pianists ' fingers . It captures in vain the significance of all we sense , as we revolve unseeingly around the vampire's hands ; guiding the gestures of mortal men , who tempt stars to bleed with beautiful words , upon marionette strings . 
I hope everyone has a great day this Thanksgiving and remembers what truly signifies the occasion . Maybe in seeing our plates full with food as well as our tables with family , we may each realize how blessed we are , and will care more deeply for those who are not . 
Brownies ! 
I'm at the library all by myself .. oh no ! hehe 
I can't find the SD card port place ! ANYWHERE on this computer ! 
I take the initiative to clear the OVERFLOWING sink and am being told i am not loading the dishwasher full enough when only she can find a way to shove another 50 of them in there . : . HMM WONDER WHY MY FORK HAS A FUCKING SPOT AS IT EMERGES FROM THE DISHWASHER . : . I am getting yelled at and after it has been neglected for so long why should even inadequate performance in that department be anything but appreciated ? 
What a fun day ! 
< PROPMALE > Zombie was effing sexy when he was 22 \

* scratches face in a withdrawaled frenzy * I NEED DIET SODA IMMEDIATELY !!!! 
Oh joyful bliss ... drinking diet pepsi and eating brownies .. :3 
At the library ... my stomach is making weird noises ! I better eat before i get looks ... =___= 
MILKSHAKES AND FRIED CHICKEN DRESSED WITH HOTSAUCE ARE DEFINITELY NOOOOOT A GOOD COMBO !!!! 
I cannot perform my own tasks and go on my own way without having more of them thrown on me because of others ' pathetically small capacity for understanding of what is dutiful and right . I sustain myself , and watch over the welfare of my nephew when needed to boot and am being terrorized for every single thing i do . Don't even fucking wonder when you find my lifeless corpse on the floor ... 
NEED NEED NEED NEW TV GUIDE SUPERNATURAL MADE THE COVER ( Which i have made happen to a degree ) 
Wanting to play sims ! Ugh !

Watching Jojo ... that being said my evening here should be quite eventful . Lmao , he's so funny ! 
Yesterday i hear Jojo's voice muffled in the other room : \I'm fightin-monsters\ " followed by my sister : \ " That's not a sword to fight monsters with that is a candle ! \ " LMAO made my night ! " 
I WANT .. TO EAT .. BRAAAAINS !!! <3 
Didn't go to school today ... how nice it was to sleep in ... <3

Diet coke and Hershey's with almonds ... all i need .. oh and Nyoko <3 
Think i caught something ( hm , and the very day we are forced to confront yet again the halls of swarming disease-ridden folk .. coincidence ? I think not ! ) ... considering the aching pain and dryness of my throat last night and this morning . This is why i have not blessed all at overbrook high with my presence today , just to let everybody know . 
I'm not going to be in school tomorrow , everyone , instead i'll be visiting the doctors . =___=

This is why i can't play zombies online : Other people don't know what they're doing , and tell me that theyre not going to revive me constantly because A ) they thought i didnt get juggernog , yet i turned the power on ... and B ) I dont panic and run from a controllable horde until i need to . Yet i have the least downs ? Please people dont get mad bc i can actually play the game . 
Does anyone know how you type in messages to your group on xbox ?

I haven't known real hate to a person until I began to get older and understand what a piece of shit my sister is . Seriously get over yourself : there hasn't been a greater disgrace to life . 
The only good part about tonight is supernatural 
I just can't stand it anymore 
Yeah god forbid we assure that I can go somewhere whenever I ask but when Jenn needs to go anywhere at all we get up and go real fucking quickly 
Not only does my best friend encourage me to lie and harm myself but she burns me with hot bowls as well . 
Can't wait to enter my picture into the anime contest ! ^___^ 
I really wish my mom would start putting her foot down because i can't stand watching my sister disrespect her ... 
Sluts get guts ... Nice to think about right now ... 
Sing me to sleep , sing me to sleep . I am tired and I want to go to bed . Sing me to sleep , sing me to sleep and then leave me alone ... 
I cut my finger while chopping vegetables !!! My first kitchen injury !!! :O 
Homemade cabbage rolls and potatoes au gratin for dinner . Compliments of tehcuh . * bows * 
Going to my mom's party in a couple of hours ... 
Happy birthday mom :D 
I love valentines day :3 
Going to take an erotically delicious nap soon ... Goodnight all ^___^ 
If you're not going to listen to me when I explain something to you then don't fucking yell at me telling me I didn't tell you how to do it 
There is a bug in my room ... I don't know what to do ! 
Whoever wants to < PROPFEMALE > for a limited amount of time I'll be at the Clementon library :D 
So .. you're cool because you scream out of car windows at the girl walking past you ... grow the hell up . 
I love lamp . :D 
Making a cranberry pie ! 
The other guys was a terrific movie ! Hilarious ! 
< PROPFIRST > had seven downs in one game ... Lol we fail playing zombies together 
Making a vegetable soup ... Yes I realize it's late lol 
Omjps if there is ANY < PROPMALE > that we don't have school tomorrow I am clinging to it ... 
Going to the library ... Maybe I will pay a stop at the vorhees town center .. 
Finally doing that history shizz 
So ... much ... to ... do ... but why .... Do ... I ... wanna play ... zombies ..... instead ?????? 
People are strange when you're a stranger \ 
Faces look ugly when you're alone \ 
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted \ 
Streets are uneven when you're down \ 
When you're strange \ 
Faces come out of the rain \ 
No one remembers your name \ 
When you're strange 
Jenn had the baby tonight ... 
So give me all your poison \ 
And give me all your pills \ 
And give me all your hopeless hearts \ 
And make me ill \ 
You're running after something \ 
That you'll never kill \ 
If this is what you want \ 
Then fire at will 
You have to practically be bleeding to death to get any prompt service at a hospital ... Two hours now and all they're doing is giving me benadryl ... Whatever that is 
Syringes and cupcakes ... give me something sweet 
< PROPFEMALE>'s next top model :3 
I do not feel like doing laundry lol ... God it's going to take every once of effort to get up 
I sit down and ofcourse Nyoko feels the need to prance over and curl up in my lap ^___\\\\ 
Veggie burritos anyone ? Mmm wish I had an avocado ... :( 
Man Nyoko is a creep ; as I'm sitting on the end of my bed I get the urge to look next to me and there she is , nestled in my blankets waiting for me to acknowledge her . And after we made eye contact she started purring and will not stop . Wtf ??!? 
Fried pineapple slices topped with powdered sugar : yummy ! If anyone wants to know how to make these leave a comment :D 
Mmmm brains drizzles in marmalade ... I'm secretly a zombie ! Hm , a vegetarian zombie ... Seems like an anomaly ... Nevertheless ... Fear me !!!!! 
There is a stinkbug in my room ! It flew at me !!! 
Am I the only one who thinks that the sound of windchimes is the most magical sound in the world ???? 
Made pancakes with fried eggs and shared them with Nyoko ^____^ 
It's funny how the presence of a bug can prevent me from going about my daily activities ... This is why men exist people :D lol 
At the library ^___^ 
So my brother is playing a sonic game lmao ... How it brings me back ! You never realize until you have the opportunity to look back on these things how absolutely ridiculous some of the stuff in them are .. For example sonic's impassioned insult to eggman : ' you big loser!' which I'm sure as kids , we perceived to be a very gutsy and serious exchange ! 
Cutting my hair ... :D 
ANTM n___n 
It's sad that I can spot music from sims deluxe edition that is used anywhere 
I made homemade apple pie ! Yum ! ^__^ 
Is about to piss in the litterbox 
Need . Chocolate . + diet . Coke . 
Healthy method of stress relief : ripping off pieces of your lip 
If anyone wants to do me the service of procuring thin and ultra thin black sharpies for me .. I would be more than grateful to them . I am in a crisis ! 
Thanks everyone !!! :D 
I'm extremely chilly ... but im going to see how long i can go without putting a sweater on :D 
Ew ! Ew ! Ew ! Omjps a stinkbug was crawling on me ! You know I've gotten way too used to them if I didn't cry when this happened ! 
The < PROPFEMALE > is beautiful tonight 
Another supernatural magazine ! Yay ! 
You know .. Sometimes when I walk in front of my mirror .. I expect myself to be taller =__= . Silly huh ? 
Everyone seems to have depressing lyrics as their statuses .. I guess I need to find some as well to keep up with the times ! 
wishes a certain someone was up :/ 
< PROPMALE > mis soon ^__^ 
Cudos to all of the wonderfully talented people who made < PROPMALE > mis possible ! Great job !! ^__^ 
Oh my gosh .. Leave me the eff alone ! I am in my room silently and I don't involve you in my life at all , so can you stop terrorizing me ?! 
So I need the animated series of supernatural ... Instantly !!!!!!! < PROPMALE > in Japanese ... oh my god I couldn't have dreamed a more perfect heaven .. 
I'm home alone !!! Ahh !!! @__@ 
Making cupcakes ! n__n 
Madhouse definitely took some creative liberties with the anime , but it was still pretty accurate in it's representation of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > and supernatural as a whole . Definitely will consume most of my time in the coming weeks .. * glued to screen * n__n 
Cut my hair :3 
It feels like a thousand phantom fingers are strangling my brain ... Headaches are the worst :/ 
No Internet at my house right now ! Damn you verizon ! 
Black butler = amazing ! Moulin rouge while i figure out my poem :D 
Um if I have to hear an infant cry because his piece of shit mother can't care to tend to him in the next room , and I have to get up to take care of him ... You DO have something to explain to me
