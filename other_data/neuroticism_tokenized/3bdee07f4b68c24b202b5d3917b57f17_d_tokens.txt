Dear Facebook , \ 
I know that you like to mess with my mind at times . Like sending me late messages , chats from people who are online/offline every 6 seconds , non-existent friend requests and so much more . I just wanted to let you know , I hate you with a passion at times Facebook , but you allow me to connect with friend that are far away . So , I forgive you ... mostly . \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFIRST >
