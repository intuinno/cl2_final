Today is an awesome day ! Both Dano and Scrappy have gotten on transport to their final destinations - HOME :) Our thanks goes out to the Sousas ( Dano ) and the Barnes ( Scrappy ) for opening their hearts and homes to these two deserving pooches ! 
I am fully aware that when a person is wanting to adopt a new dog that they have the right to be a little particular in what they want . They ARE choosing a member of their family that they will live with for years to come ; however , I canNOT understand what the difference is between a 7 lb Poodle and a 9-10 lb Poodle . Can someone please enlighten me ??? 
Well , it is official :) < PROPMALE > and Hermes are now on their way to their new homes . Yip ! Yip ! Hooray !!!

So many people ask us \Where do you find the pets you rescue ? \ " Well 
Please put this on your status if you know or \ 
are related to someone who suffers from stupidity . People need to \ 
understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You \ 
could be sitting next to a sufferer right now . There is still no known \ 
cure for stupidity and sympathy does not help . But we can raise \ 
awareness . \ 
93% won't copy and paste this because they don't know how to \ 
copy and paste ... 
“For\ 
perhaps , if the truth were known , we are all a little blind , a little \ 
deaf , a little handicapped , a little lonely , a little less than perfect . \ 
And if we can learn to appreciate and utilize the dog’s full potential , \ 
we will , together , make it in this life on earth . ” -Author unknown 
Thurs , < PROPMALE > ( a 5 yr Mini Poodle X ) was surgically relieved of an inability to urinate by a procedure known as a PU . We had him flown in from CT on Wed bc his situation was too critical for ground transport . Unfortunately , we had to move so quickly to get < PROPMALE > here and evaluated , we had no time to work on fund-raising for his care . If you are able to spare even $1 , no donation is too small ! 
< PROPMALE > is one week into his recovery from his PU surgery and is already peeing like he was born to squat ! Go , < PROPMALE > , Go ;) We are still needing donations to help with his medical expenses as we have only had one donation made thus far :( 
So the final count on the pups is 11 !!! Andi ( momma ) has definitely bitten off more than she can chew for a first litter ... that's right , this girl is most certainly less than a year old ! She is a 35-ish lb mix and looks like a miniature < PROPFEMALE > Retriever . 
Setting up Andi and Crew's new crate with much more room for growing puppy butts :) \ 
THANK YOU to < PROPFEMALE > Horvitz Garlington and < PROPFEMALE > Hebert Allday for making the bigger kennel possible !!! 
PUBLIC OPINION POLL ::: I would like your opinion on the following situation ... \ 
A \rescue organization\ " takes in a dog with a broken jaw and gets no medical care for her stating that she is pregnant and there is nothing that can be done due to her reproductive status . They force her to raise her litter while in unquestionable pain . Is this a case of neglect ? Are they justified in refusing care because she is pregnant ? " 
Ok , FB friends . We have two new dogs that need our help . No Name is a 45-ish lb mix that was hit by a car and needs a < PROPMALE > home . His medical has been generously donated by the Samaritan who witnessed his accident and rushed him to the Animal ER . No Name needs a < PROPMALE > for 6-8 wks while he recuperates from his injuries . And < PROPMALE > needs financial support . Check out his album - pitiful . 
< PROPMALE > Update : We have our fourth meal down and have finally started to pee w the fluids ( I was beginning to get a bit worried ) . He seems to be perkier than 16 hrs ago , but it is all relative and I'm looking for improvement so ... He is vocal now so I guess that means that there is some energy other than what is needed to live , metabolically speaking . I hate to make predictions and jinx the whole endeavor , so I won't . 
the First 24 hrs of < PROPMALE>'s new life have been very productive . I just took him outside for the second time to meet Auntie < PROPFEMALE > and the chicken delivery . He is now standing , albeit wobbly and very awkwardly , and he was even adamantly sniffing a bush ! I have faith that < PROPMALE > is definitely going to make it ! Howlelujah !!! 
Day 3 for Nick : yes , we did bloodwork today and everything looked good but his BUN ( renal ) was slightly off . This could be due to his overall poor hydration status . He has been eating very well on his own but seems uninterested in drinking water . We are going to monitor for now . Overall , he is doing AWESOME !!! Standing on his own more and seems to just be in better spirits all around . 
We are almost a week into < PROPMALE>'s recovery and he is doing GREAT ! He now has an URI , most likely picked it up at the shelter , but we have antibiotics so no biggie on that front . He is still eating every 4-5 hrs . We are trying to start spacing meals out a little more to get him on a more normal schedule . He already looks sooo much better and will have a new video posted today to show off his progress :) 
Andi & Crew UPDATE : The last nine weeks have been a whirl-wind of puppy butts and drama , but we have survived our ordeal :) The Great Exodus is upon us and the puppies are leaving one by one over the next week to their new families . Andi has also been adopted and will be heading with her new dad to TX the first weekend in March . HOWLELUJAH !!! 
Anyone know anything about Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots ? 
< PROPMALE > : Day 8 - < PROPMALE > is still making it , but even with starting him on antibiotics after the first sniffle , his URI is still getting worse . and with kennel cough , they always get sooo much worse before starting to get better that I am beginning to get nervous about the next few days . He has already started to eat less per feeding so we are going to keep him at smaller meals every 4 hrs . I just feel terrible for him :( 
I need some advice ! My HTC TouchPro2 finally died on Sat and I need help deciding on a new smartphone . The TP2 had all the features I wanted ( slide-out qwerty , full/large touch screen , GPS , great reception , etc ) but was a NIGHTMARE pretty much from the day I got it over a year ago . One mechanical issue after another . I am very rough w my cell so an iPhone is not an option ... 
< PROPMALE > Update - Day 15 : < PROPMALE > is doing well thanks to his Auntie < PROPFEMALE > Hebert Allday for bringing him his chicken and herbal meds for his congestion . < PROPMALE > also wants to shout out to his Auntie < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Hinsman at Destination DOG for all of the nutritional advise that has keep his little body kicking and progressing . ( cont'd in comments ) 
HELP !!! We just took in a 4.9 lb < PROPFIRST > X that needs to have a front leg amputated ... TODAY !!! I hate to be a beggar but here I am , requesting donations bc this little dude's pockets are empty :( You can PayPal to LaurensZoo@yahoo.com or can call the vet directly with your CC . Just call me to get the vet's info . THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY !!! 
THANK YOU , < PROPFEMALE > !!! Your mom , < PROPFEMALE > Horvitz Garlington totally ROCKS !!! 
Lovebird anyone ??? < PROPFIRST>'s Zoo now has 7 - three bonded pairs and a singleton . Why am I all-of-a-sudden a bird rescue ?!? 
< PROPMALE > Update : We just got back from the vet's and < PROPMALE>'s new bloodwork looks good enough to schedule a dental for Monday . So ... we have all weekend to fundraise and cross-post < PROPMALE>'s \Empty Pockets\ " Plea ! Thanks to everyone for their continued support of < PROPMALE >!" 
I <3 the internet . Without it I would not have the bestest friends that I have never met in person , the most awesome adopters that have gone above and beyond for the critters whose lives I salvaged but that are really living bc someone other than me could see the value in their souls , be bankrupt ( financially & emotionally ) and unable to continue the rescue work that drives me every day , I could go on but ...
