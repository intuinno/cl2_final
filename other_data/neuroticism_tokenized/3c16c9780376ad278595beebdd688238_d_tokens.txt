I can't wait to go to church this Sunday . Halfway Dance sounds good , too . : ) 
In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness . We do not know what we ought to pray for , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express . And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will . ( Romans 8:26 -27 ) 
stressing out ... -_- 
Seek the Lord while he may be found ; call on him while he is near . Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts . Let him turn to the Lord , and he will have mercy on him , and to our God , for he will freely pardon . ( Isaish 55:6 -7 ) 
Dear Spring Break , I can't wait to spend time with you ...
