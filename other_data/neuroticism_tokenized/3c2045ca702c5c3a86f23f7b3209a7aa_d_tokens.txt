is swimming in nerdy indulgences ... HARRY POTTER !! :) 
Phoenix to < PROPMALE > , 1 hour layover , < PROPMALE > to Philly , HOME ! ( For 3 days at least ... haha ) 
FINALLY HOME . 
was just visited by her elusive creative muse , which seems to visit her when she least expects it and hides when she needs it most . Writing late into the night , and defying the all-consuming powers of jet lag . 
, a rising college sophomore , was just carded to get into an R-RATED MOVIE . 
Public Enemies was FANTASTIC . 
is watching The Godfather . 
rereading < PROPMALE > Potter for the umpteenth time ( from book 5 on ) . MLIN . ( My life is nerdy ) .

Holy SHIT . The Exorcist is probably one of the most INTENSE movies I have ever seen . 
When < PROPMALE > Met < PROPFEMALE > ... <3 :)

loves Funny People . :) 
7 days and counting !!! :) 
The Time Traveler's Wife was pretty good , but the ending was kind of anticlimactic ... I'm in the middle of the book now , and I hope the ending is better . But still worth the $$ to see it in the theaters .
