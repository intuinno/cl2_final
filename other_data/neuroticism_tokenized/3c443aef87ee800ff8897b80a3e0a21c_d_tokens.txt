Je t'aime , mes amis ! 
Rock out to some sweet musics .... ~ ~ Baby , I think I owe ya one , every time I come around you're ready for the letdown ... ~ ~ 
Is it not odd how the term friend is used so loosely today ? In my head , be it waerped or not , I WILL lay down my life for my friends , will try to save them if I can , and I love them completely ... Though if I just said that people look at me oddly . I shall deal with that ; friends are friends , I can rely on them !! And of course they can on me . 
Tears fall down your face , the taste is something new ... Bottle up old love , and throw it out to sea , and watch you wait as you cry ; a year has passed , the seasons change .. Please just don't play with me , my paper heart will bleed .. Be with me please ... Summertime , the nights they are so long , the leaves fall down , so do I .... Winter nights , my bedside is cold for I am gone !.. Spring blossoms you to me .. 
I am nervous ...... I just re-learned Vivaldi's < PROPFEMALE > !! Zut , zut , zut !! Sorry for the foul language . 
DO NOT ACCEPT A FRIEND REQUEST FROM < PROPFIRST > DAVIES OR < PROPFEMALE > DAVIES THEY ARE HACKERS .... PLEASE TELL EVERYONE ON YOUR LIST BECAUSE IF SOMEONE ON YOUR LIST ADDS THEM THEY WILL BE ON YOUR LIST TOO .... HE WILL FIGURE OUT YOUR COMPUTER IP AND ADDRESS ... SO PLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS MESSAGE TO EVERYONE , EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM IN YOUR LIST- a friend told me ... 
Ahh in orchestra chamber ensemble . I doubt I'm ready , though I know the music almost okay I guess .... 
Why can't I practice < PROPFEMALE > at HOME ? I just know I'll mess up at the concert , concerts if he lets me ( MAKES me ) play in the other as well ..... 
I feel so elated now , when I'm with him , he's so amazing , so near perfect , how can he not see his own greatness ? 
I'm afraid , terribly frightened .... Who else has French 3 honors on their regestration form for high school ... AND goes to Creekside next year ... I am so scared and feel desolate .... >.< 7.7 
Concert wasn't SO bad .... HOW do you wreck my GD dragon thing ?! goodness gracious I'm not feeling well ..... I love him and I can picture him comforting me now so I guess I'll be okay ..... ( Ends on tone of love ) 
Ifeel as if I'm in love ... Such euphoria ! Il est < PROPFEMALE > homme tres intelligent , sympa , et < PROPMALE > aussie ... <.< 
I really love him with ALL of my heart ... 
Want to kill SOMEONE ..... 
I love mes amis .... 
I feel as if I'm in love ..... And yes , we all know with whom .... X ) 
Mouse is dead and so I'm online at the moment with absolutely no use of the mouse . Wondering who the three are that are online right now , I guess I'll never know unless they message me . Goodness , aren't I smart for a dumb person ? 
Won't get a new mouse until after Christams . But it's okay , I love someone and I'm pretty sure they love me too , so I'm happy 
Hmmn .. People still need to let me in on some good games I could actually play .. D: 
School tomorrow ... Can't believe it ... And he better have my \stuff\ " for me like he said ... " 
I love you ! Hope you don't mind my now-too-short-hair !! >.< 
Noticed how terrible I look in my pic ... lol =pp 
Can't believe it ... Didn't know that Barack Obama was the U.S. President ? J.A. , where were YOU ? Thank my meanie of a best friend D.B. , then ? ( And .. for HOW many months now ?! ) 
Love is a highway ; it's not always a two-way street , one often gets run over , and even when faced with such a crippling pain inside , one has to keep quiet out of care for others , knowing that one may not be loved again but one keeps loving on and yet repeatedly gets hurt and hurts others .... 
Oh , how I wish I had some good books to read .... Too bad I read like all the books at home ..... I WANT WESTERFELD ... BOOKS ! ( ERD ! ) SHUT UP !! X ( 
Hmm ... Why did I write like ten poems today ? I don't even like poetry ... lol they are NOT morbid .. just true on how this plague of humanity works ... *<~- Love you Cris ... Forever one of my best friends and you know that though I'll never tell you to your face I said this .... <3 -~>* 
Lies close in all around me , block off my airways , suffocate my happiness .. Is everyone around me just a lie , so carefully crafted into a human figure ? 
Brandon : I measured on Sunday and keep forgetting to post ... But I'm a little over 5 foot 2 ... 
One night stand and a photograph made its way to you ; took a < PROPMALE > , paid the consequesnce this is why I'm writing to you ( Was it a big surprise ? Is it to late to try ? Go ahead and cry , it was just one little lie ) I hope that you don't mind I'll make it up this time .. You need to believe it when I say that I am so so so sorry for the things I put you through ; never meant to take the trust from you .. 
Teachers , teachers , murderers ... Killing we students from the inside out . ( What is a way to illustrate the AMENDMENTS ?! ) 
lol Lakers finally got almost a tie ; one point !... GO CELTICS !! Actually idk I just saw near-end of it on the television lol .... SPORTS AREN'T BAD TO PLAY ! um ... Schoolwork suckss ... idk o_o 
Ladden with work ... asking a friend about math stuff .... and of course a close friend has ( yet again ... ) cut me off ... 
Maiya ... teach me my first dance please ? 7.7 ~ How is it that I always wish you're here , but when you're here I feel like ( s ) because you don't do the sweet little things that make my heart nearly burst , don't hold my hand , don't make me fall in love with you in new ways each and every time , like you used to ? ~ 
Eternal lies wrap my spirit , choke my happiness and corrupt my will ... How easy it would be if I did not care ! How easy it would be if I did not feel ! Betrayel ... Who gets hurt ? Lust .. Who lies writhingly on the ground ? Lies ... Who wishes for the ease of death ? Those that are inhumane ; those that care and love and give what they can ... SUCKERSSSS ... 
L ? i khi có l ? i , tôi hoàn h ? o . Tôi vô tình l ? a d ? i , b ? th ?? ng , và phá h ? y gây ra .... 
I find it odd ... The more I talk to him , about him , think about him , or anything dealing with him .. I notice what a small range of vocabulary I posess . ( I love him ... >.<) 
Boulevard of Broken Dreams ... Heard for the first time in a long time today ! I LOVE that song .. Haven't heard Time of Dying or Pain , or Riot or Whispers in the Dark ... Three Days Grace ! Good < PROPFEMALE > ! Green Day ! Linkin Park ! Come back to me , my music !! 
I tell you what I know , you profusely deny it , and yet here we are : in your mind , the truth finally comes clear to you : I'm just a bother , an unneeded burden , and I want to ask what happened , but I dare not to .. 
When I'm gone , just < PROPFEMALE > on don't mourn , rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm lookin'down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain , just smile back .. I feel alive when you're beside me I will not die , I'll wait here for you In my time of dying On this bed I lay 
I feel like ... ( s ) and .. I'm glad that you probably don't know how I feel ... because if you did , I know I'd be much more hurt and you might even snip me right away , as more than ample a friend has done before ! Terrible things when should have been best ... With me ? As if .. 
New fake name ideas ? Changing it ... ( And , Mis . < PROPFIRST > , HERE is where YOU can put what YOU think it should be ! lol . ) 
What , then ? the river , it deepns , the earth , it cries out ... The onslaught of water , at first deceptively cool , just a slight stream , but it increased in violence and rushing of its kin and now expanded self becomes ever so more detrimental to the land , stirps the land of everything it is , and the slight trickle has evolved into a mad , hurtful thing , unwittingly so . If you don't get the metaphor oh well ... 
Okay . I'm going to do it . I swear I am . I'll formally ask him out . I swear I will . I will . I'm going to . Maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but when I'm ready and it seems he can hear it , I'll ask him to ... go our with me . I still find it weird for girl to be asking boy but I'm going to do it ! I swear ! Dang ... Wish me luck ...?! 
You know , I wouldn't be so pained if I just ... DIDN'T CARE .... But I do .. and I wouldn't change that because of the happiness ( I've ?! ) caused others and I don't care how much , how severe the pain , just that they're happy ... [ That's you guys .. and maybe someone else but I feel so USED by him ... ] 
lol felt better just talking to him recently ... and he knows ( should know ) that no matter the pain , I love him and he's worth it . He's so amazing ... Incredible , funny , sweet , thoughtful , sexy .... Umm yeah not used to it but he is ! ^^ ( The one I love : On my mind . ) 
Ahh < PROPFEMALE > I wanna help ease your pain but I know I can't , I'm useless but I wanna help you ... And yet there's nothing I can do ... ( Um about all my friends just about .. and I use < PROPFEMALE > for < PROPFIRST > and other people I care about if they're hurt [ well I do in my mind never irl but to my lil bro but still ! ] or I think they're hurt or want consolidate because I do wish I could provide it but I can't augh I'm so useless >.<) 
So . I love someone . So . I'm a book-freak . Am I ? So . Yeah . And . Really , < PROPMALE > Riordan made the series awesome , but the commercails ( I saw [ well , heard ^^'']) make the series look so stupid .. Yo , at least I read the series , a'right ? And , hahaha , whatever , he may or may not know , sure , and yet you still call me a hopeless romantic ? Okay , my mind is different from y actions so shut up ! 
Sometimes I wish someone made me , will make me , promise what I have made them promise .. but of course noone cares and people , you know who you are , I expect you to hold to your damn word ! You'd better not do anything of the sort ... And I know , excrutiating pains and overwhelming stress , but you promised me .. 
Any ideas for me to use in my Upward Bound Application ? Autobiography bit ? You people know me better than I know myself , I guess . Ideas ?! And oh yeah .. Who else is going to apply ?! I don't wanna be alone ...... Wait no they're not going to accept me but I don't wanna be alone trying for it !! 
Ahh orchestra practice .. Just means less time with who I love ... T . - ( Cause I'm detrimental like that . ) And I love you , Thai ! 
Know what ? I don't wanna go to the concert , let alone play in it . Know what ? I have no choice . Know what ? I'll probably have no time to get on the normal stuff today . Only meebo and e-mail ( see , < PROPFIRST > , now you done got me hooked =D ) and that's basically it ! Unless I get updates and have to check FB or MS . I miss you , < PROPMALE > , and I hope you had fun ! And I * wonder * what Thai's going to tell me . I have a suspicion . =.= 
DFB on my mind ! TDG , too , hmm .. ( TDG the band not < PROPMALE > =D ) Aww and yeah < PROPMALE > , you too ! I love ya , don't ya know ? ^^ DSB , DHB , you guys too .. ( sheesh , soft chicks .. >.>) Oh ! How I adore you ( waking up to you never felt so real ) the way you make me feel ( waking up to you never felt so real ) Breathing life , waking up , my eyes open up .. Didn't hear Comatose in a long time so shut upp ! =) Hmm , I miss NMR and LY , too . =o 
The light tint dies out in the dark shades of our souls ; however light the white may be in deception , for it's being swallowed by the ever-consuming calligraphy ink ; there's no < PROPMALE > to fully make it to the white which will by all means be discarded by the impurity of the spreading plague .. Is there no hope in this world , in our lives , in our souls ? 
Maiya ? Explain to me more about this crush thing ? lol you sayin he's a player ? =p and totally unrelated : Mom got wrong < PROPFEMALE > so we should start selling Monday . Leave my brother thrashing . I advise so , anyway . I'll post it lol . He thrusts his fists against the pole and still insists he sees the ghosts ? I doubt it's correct from my memory lol .. IT FTW !! 
Hey , I got it . Finally . I'm not too nice or too emotional . YOU are too mean and too insensitive . No , wait , I can't say that because you guys love me , right ? Well , society in general and , um , you guys are all just used to society , um , yeah .. And I'm freakin ' COMPASSIONATE , not suicidal .. silly friend-person =p 
I don't know what's worth fighting for /Or why I have to scream /I don't know why I instigate /And say what I don't mean /I don't know how I got this way /I know it's not alright /So I'm breaking the habit /I'm breaking the habit Tonight ... /I tightly lock the door /I try to catch my breath again /I hurt much more /Th ... an anytime before /Cause inside I realize /That I'm the one confused 
I got hurt yesterday in the class of physical Education . Well , it's more a cu t-t ype-thingy , but still . It hurts . I don't like this class . T.T I don't like < PROPFEMALE > . I don't like missing my old friends . I like my friends here . I love my friends here . =) =/

Hes not on ... Dang it , I missed him .. Darn it , I miss him ... And maybe it's love ... I'm not sure .. And if he were on I'd be less sure overall because I can't think around him .. As Di said ,... I'm such a girl .. Lol 
Tap Tap Revenge Three . I'm not ... Bad at it !! I'll check up on here and MySpace though , no worries ! And it tells me of Yahoo ! Messages ! Yeah ... I love y'all .

Shredding the last sinewy artery from her soul to her body , he left her -- cold , uncaring , empty , dead .... See , I can't do much but description and begninnings and individual stuffs .... 
POUNDING headache ..... Freakin ' painful .. And I'm glad it made me detatched today because then I didn't annoy you as much ... And it feels eating away at me ... I ate cereal with milk right now for the first time in .. ever ... 
We actually went out . < PROPFIRST > Park . The park with swings . Was fun even with my headache -- migraine ? And they had fudge at < PROPFEMALE > Corral -- Mmmmh , fudge .... And I had to close my eyes but I liked the feel of the wind .. Ouch still . 
If you look everybody here is trying on new faces , And the ones that fit are suprisingly contagious ! With a shiny new beginning we cordially invite you to -- Into the dressing room ... Oh God , this season has seen better days . Keep it steady ' cause your losing the pace . We're never gonna be the same ... Hamza , Maiya , Heard yet ? XD TTR3 ? I wanna be tapping when I hear though sooo ....

Love -- love -- love -- So what if it's ( not since , ) was in sixth grade , too ? I ... like him ... not love him .. in that such way ... And H * yeah , I'm flustered-feeling ... 
Who's going on that fieldtrip ? I'm not . Who's going to stay behind with me ...? I don't wanna be alone ! O_o And mom thought it was because someone was going ? I don't even know if he's going ! Why should I care , anyway ? Possibility .. Scary , scary .. 
You call , she doesn't answer , you write , she doesn't answer , you go out , you see him with her- she told you she was sick at home . The ring that you gave her , thrown away , with all the letters , and when you find out , he doesn't even care at all ... I don't memorize lyrics , albeit GC's great !! Break Apart Her Heart . Although I disagree . 
TAG___BLACK CLOTHES TOMMOROW ( Because I wanna support my friend . XD ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Waits !! Don't even dare !! I didn't ever want you to know !! Why in the land of hills did you ever want to know ?! And stay the hill's head away from him !! And yeah . Tell noone . You gave your darned word !! 
Apparently .. People have known ? Confronted him ? Huh ? Ehh ?! .... And yeah , gotta get out of the land of false hopes , gotta stop hopin he likes me because he doesn't . He probably doesn't even think me of a friend . All over before it began . He was probably just humoring me before . ( Me not observations but reflection ... ) 
Je ne sais pas , Mais je trouve qu'il est < PROPFEMALE > meil < PROPFEMALE > ur garçon , et c'est il pour la même homme ! Et avec cela , je suis ...

.... Please forgive me for that vast amount of swearwords in that message ... It's just very painful to me that it happened , and that PEOPLE are GOSSIPPING of it ... Please , just don't do that , try to be sympathetic or , should you be unknowing to such paion , EMPATHETIC .. And forgive me , but anyone so insensitive as to not be able to do so ,... That's PATHETIC ..... 
..... I later dreamed I'd put my hand on the desk and he reached for it and held it ... ? ... Whatever , I am a girl , yes , and -- what ? You're a boy ? * Sigh * XD 
My sheer euphoria , dashed by mention of his name -- leaving me wide-eyed and wavering , wavering .... I'm still joyous at this such accomplishment , and yet I still wish , still wish , still upkeep my false , false hopes and all the while now he doesn't feel the same , would never feel the same ...

-This city looks so pretty , do you wanna burn it with me ' till the skies bleed ashes and the f*king skyline crashes ! - ~ Take the pill , in God we trust , Go and kill , God loves us , after life , after death , breathing ' till there is no breath . I will not die in the night but in the light of the sun and the ashes of this world in my lungs ... ~ 
I still miss the person I've been missing the most the most , I wish that I could see her or talk with her , it's brinking past painful .. And that dream with Pennywise reminded me so much of her ; I miss her so frickin much ! Maiya FunSizee < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Cordova , you guys know who I'm talking about .. Who cares who sees ? I love her above all else , and I can shout it aloud . On public posts .

I miss the times that my lips met you , the times I finally caved into my wants and bit you , and oh , when I tasted you , it was heaven ... And yet I hated when the creamy , white fluid escaped its encasement ... Oh , I < PROPFEMALE > want you right now , Klondike bar ..... ='(( 
Upset with Maiya FunSizee < PROPFIRST > . Why would you just not let me know how the < PROPFIRST > goes ?! 7.7 And ... I know ....... >.<

Can I not help to bathe in the essence of your brilliant gray-blue eyes ? Is it so much a bother for you , my adoration of your perfection ? I myself simply can not live without the ability to gaze upon your wondrous perfection .... ( Inspiration ? Not as one would think . ) 
The essence of your finely toned being , your inner workings , your true self , gleams in the moonlight , for even in utter despair , your light is still glowing , luminously showing the way . 
I can't believe it . I have a baby . O.O 
I look like a boy . =.= 
It's coming .... 
My predictions , they were true . 
Ik < PROPFIRST > hou .... =] That's basically all I know ... Forgot the rest he told me .... 
His fingers slipping in with mine , our gazes averted to anything but , and I still fight the losing battle of my fluttering smile , yet we continue in our little world next to the trees that shade us from the light . 
47-0 . Hats off to the Seminoles . 
She likes him ..... o.X 
Perhaps maybe I should change my last name once more .... Again .... But to what ? ( Still up for any suggestions . Miss D.A. ! Lmao < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and such .... <3 ) 
He's way too smart ..... X.o 
I know I can never hold you in my arms . Yet for some reason , I still make myself scavenge for that hope that's never true ... \ " , 201 0-0 9-08 01:41:56 " 
9/11 ? Like Americans would mourn over the millions THEY ( we ... ) have killed on any day ! And people die and such . Why take it out on a whole range of people who follow that such religion ? People aren't well . And Americans seem to be at the least of the chain . Too bad I'm one . 
Now you're gone , I realize my love for you was strong , and I miss you here now you're gone , I've been waiting here by the phone , With the pictures hanging on the wall ... 
Y/E/H ... :) 
< PROPFEMALE > , I'm home . ^^ 
Moi-meme ... Deveon Atkins , gave me a bad word in it ....!! ~ Although it kinda does work out , so .. But also could be .. I love you anyways ;) ( But I mean like rather love . O.O ) 
Now way out , \ 
No end in sight , \ 
I'm trapped here below\ 
With only blind hands to hear shout upon shout\ 
I'll for you and ever fight \ 
And even choose to let it show . \ 
\ 
It's a vision never dreampt , \ 
A hand unheld by all\ 
A confused mass of things from below and above , \ 
These hurts and pains for always felt\ 
Nothing to ever hear my troubled call ;\ 
So this is what it means , to be in love . 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ... I actually like it ... ^_^ 
I'm not what you say I am ~ 
\The truth is ... \""

He wears his heart safety-pinned to his backpack , his backpack is all that he knows\ 
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple the heart and devour the soul\ 
All alone , he turns to stone while holding his breath half to death\ 
Terrified of what's inside , to save his life , he crawls like a worm from a bird ... 
Seems too long since I last talked with him o.O When was that ... few days ago ? lol .. Miss you much , < PROPFIRST > !! c.c 
Reading what you recommended :)) 
I miss ... snow !! D: 
It's that you're so sweet , \ 
That you give a smiling hand\ 
You pass through each trial . \ 
Our talks are my favored treat , \ 
My crutch with which I may stand ;\ 
I love even how you're in denial . \ 
( This one seems ruched , too , I bet .... y . y)\
