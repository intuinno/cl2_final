It's VBS time again ... There's no place like Rome ! Coming to a church near you . 

( Part 2)I was crestfallen . I had to pay the additional $18 , of course . And on my way to the car , I was mad at myself . But I paused and took a deep breath . “Instead of thinking of this as a negative thing , I have to figure out how it is a good thing , ” I told my dad over the phone on my drive back to Gainesville . “How ? ” he asked me . “I don’t know , ” I replied , “I just know that I can’t let this become a negative thing . ” 
( 3 ) When I got home , I carefully unwrapped the tea set , washed each piece carefully , and as I was toweling them dry , I looked over at the lamp with the broken glass top . I could crazy glue the pieces back together , I thought to myself . Argh . I was still trying to overcome my self-doubt . 
( 4 ) And then , it occurred to me that the lamp represented me ; that as torn and shattered as I may feel , I have a strong base to rest on ; It’s up to me . I decide that no matter what , I am going to let my light shine .
