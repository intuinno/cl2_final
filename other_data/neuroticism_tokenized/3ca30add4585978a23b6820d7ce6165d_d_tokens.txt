is back from the doctor's and off to the library . 
Well , I survived the Mayhem Fest - best show ever ... when I consider that not 5 years ago I would never have dreamed that I'd have paid to go see Slayer or < PROPFEMALE > Manson , much less actually seen them on stage - much less enjoyed it beyond all description

is back from the bar - still slightly drunk and head spinning from the metal . Check out Tyranny Enthroned , they're a local band , they've got a good sound . And Origin was brutal . 
spent last night waiting for a tow truck in a parking lot in Overland and this morning < PROPMALE > over in the basement of a church . Nothing's ever dull . 
... what kind of logic dictates that someone trying to pay for grad school has $150 to spend 5 times a year just to get into grad school that you can't afford in the first place because you spent all your money on the GRE ...? 
is having one of those days . 
The only good thing about today is that it's finally over . Tomorrow will be better . 
There are days I just want to dye my skin green and walk around town acting perfectly normal . It makes people question their sanity . 
Trying to talk myself out of going out driving in my jacked-up car in the middle of the night ... 
is pissed the fuck off . Some people just shouldn't be allowed to inflict themselves on the rest of humanity . 
just got home from the Landing and closing down < PROPFIRST > B's . Good times .

Watching Resident Evil : Apocalypse . \Motherfucker please ! My shit's custom . \ " lmao "

needs a new job , a sexy man and a tasty sandwich . Not necessarily in that order . 
There is a beehive in Ghetto Beast's engine ... an actual beehive . I don't know why we're not meant to get rid of that old < PROPFIRST > , but the universe can't be much clearer than a swarm of angry bees that attack every time we try to pop the hood . 
is waiting impatiently . Time never moves so slowly as when you want something you can't yet have .

loves an overcast day . 
Father is having surgery in the morning . Everyone , please offer prayers , good < PROPFEMALE > and/or positive energy of whatever variety you ascribe to on his behalf . Thanks .

is going out to face the world for a while . I feel like I need a sword and shield ... or at least a good strong can of mace ... 
is at home . Again . As usual .

is listening to Inside the Fire and laughing maniacally with < PROPFIRST > Draiman ; \release your life and take your place inside the fire with her ... \ " ... muwahahahahaha ! I LOVE Disturbed ! " 
started belly dancing workouts again . My hips are so sore I can barely walk , but my arms are getting much stronger . * complain complain complain * I feel much better now . We'll see if the payoff balances the pain . 
is in a real bind . I would say that at least things can't get any worse , but I won't , because the universe always finds a way . Mother Nature can be such a bitch . 
is going for a walk on Manchester . Wave if you see me . 
is looking for a brick to throw through a window . In a good way . 
just applied to work at Halloween Express and Creepyworld . lol , Talk about following your dreams ... ^_^

is making plans to raise hell in at Frontier Park . Possibly quite literally . ^_^ 
wrote two whole chapters last night and feels incredibly rejuvinated . Nothing like clearing the cobwebs out of your skull to make you see things with fresh eyes . 
has learned to write 14 kanji characters , and how to read the days of the week in kanji as well . I realize this sounds lame , but kanji is freakn complicated ! 
is going to spend tomorrow at Castlewood . If you need me , I'll be meditating on a rock shelf somewhere in the bluffs above the river . * happy * 
just busted her hand punching a desk , proving once again that women can do anything men can do , even if it involves acting stupid in a fit of irrational anger . I'll put another tally up for the femminists , just as soon as I can feel my fingers again ^_^ 
is chillin in her pjs on a rainy afternoon . 
is irked at Republicans . Not for any particular reason . It's just a perptual state of being for me and it's been a slow day . 
has a cold . It turns out that driving rain , blasting AC and second hand smoke do not mix well . Who'd have thought ? 
just changed the Facebook language setting to ' pirate ' . This is the most amusing thing that's happened to me in at least three hours .

is working on finding marigolds for Halloween . If you know a place that sells them this late in the year , let me know , I can't even find a place that will ship them up from the south . Thanks 
is watching V for Vendetta . Excellent movie . I'm sure there are movies out there with more poignant and dramatic editing and symbolism , but at the moment I just can't think of any . Plus , < PROPMALE > Weaving's voice is remarkably sexy when he speaks in alliteration . 
is running away with the circus . 
is out in the rain , in so many different ways ; its rather poetic . 
is off to Belleville for the day . 
just finished hanging papel picado . Tomorrow , baking pan de muerto and sugar skulls , and carving pumpkins . Making a holiday is freakn exhausting . 
just finished watching the director's cut of Drag Me to Hell . Dumbest thing I've ever seen . The bitch actually got into a fist fight with a handkerchief . I was litterally on the floor laughing . Next up , The Haunting ! ( not the crappy re-make , the 1963 original . Now that's a scary movie ! ) 
needs a new job , a sexy man and a shot of tequilla . Not necessarily in that order ... 
\ ... I'm sick of this tombstone mentality - if there's an afterlife then it'll set you free - but I'm not gonna part the seas - you're a self-fulfilling prophecy ... \ " * anger vented * " 
is going out of her mind trying to figure out grad school . The program I want is only available in Columbia , and I only have about 2 more years available to educate myself before I have to sell my soul for money ... I am experiencing an overwhelming < PROPFEMALE > to hurl my monitor through the nearest window ... maybe then they'd lock me up in a padded room and I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore . =P 
remembers the ' good ol ' days ' before Country Western music became political . It's comforting to know it's not just me that's changed . It also kinda sucks . 
is awake . At 6 am . Hell should be freezing over right about now ... 
has officially reduced her chances of getting the Swine Flu by 70% . Yay . 
dusted off the old flute case today for the first time in years . * < PROPFEMALE > sigh * I miss making music . 
dressed up today , for no better reason than to feel pretty . If I ever get the bright idea to wear heels to the doctor's office again , someone needs to shoot me in the kneecap . 
has lost a large portion of faith in the St. < PROPFIRST > County Library . It's a dark day . =P 
just got back from sitting in the ER for 7 hours ; Dory is fine - if I don't get some sleep , I might not be . * snore *

< PROPMALE > . ZOMBIE . WAS . EPIC !!! If you ever have a < PROPMALE > to see him live , you MUST . I will not spoil the details - suffice it to say it involved a 12 foot tall dancing robot suit , Japanese tentacle monsters and a string bass shaped like a coffin ... amongst OTHER things ... XD Also , they did a live recording , so listen for the live version of Sick Bubblegum ( I think ) on Hellbilly Deluxe 2 ! STL represents ! ^_^

FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic circles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works

is in a miserable amount of pain right now . I'd cry , but that would only make it hurt worse . Uuuuuugggggghhhh ... anyone who's my friend will come over here right now and beat me unconcious with a blunt object . Just don't touch my bookshelves =P 
You know how in MS Paint you can only hit the ' undo ' button 3 times , and you always need just one more ' undo ' to get the graphic perfect ? It never fails . You can curse and fume and kick yourself all you want , but that 4th ' undo ' just isn't going to happen ...

is feeling rather hopeless . Life is such a bitch . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% wont copy and paste this , mainly because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ?

finds the idea of shadow matter as defined by theoretical particle physics to be incredibly appealing - way cooler than neutrinos or axions as a candidate for missing dark matter - straight out of every single sci-fi novel written in the past 20 years . XD 
<3<3<3 \ .... It's when hate turns to love and love to hate - Faith to doubt and doubt to faith - Feel it turning your heart into stone - Feel it piercing your courageous soul - You're beyond redemption - And no one's going to catch you when you fall ... \ " <3<3<3 -- Listen to H.I.M. "

is reading Nietzsche . I have decided that either he took himself too seriously or the people who interpreted his writings took him too seriously ; there is truth in what he writes , but only to a point - after that , it becomes dogmatic and thereby contradicts itself ...

for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease , nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ! 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ????

I want to put down roots in the cradling earth , stretch my hands high until clouds drift between my fingers , bow my head in repose and sleep the ages away bound in wood until I cease to be ... I want to speak in whispers and dance with the wind ... I want to be a tree ... so badly ...

There are few sights more soul-chillingly beautiful than the full < PROPFEMALE > shimmering through the twisted , frost-glittered branches of a bare tree . It makes one still and helpless as a mouse under the razor-edged glint of an owl's gaze , struck terrified and thrilled by the cold , lonely and dangerous beauty of the dead winter night ... ? 
Thrilled to giddy little otaku pieces by the < PROPFEMALE > no Kusabi 2010 preview I just saw ? I'm sure nothing could compare to the original OAV , but wow ! * fans * It certainly looks promising ! I cannot fathom why they would have trouble getting financing , < PROPFEMALE > no Kusabi is practically an institution in certain circles , AIC needs to get their butts in gear , fast ! * pouts *

Has a teetering tower of manga to finish by tonight ( since I'm picking up another pile from the library tomorrow ) - trying to get as many books read as possible before classes start - then I'll only have time to read text books ( three science classes - #% *$!!) * cries * Wish me luck - with all of it ^^ 
Orientation tomorrow afternoon ... so weird to think of taking classes again = $ 
Stlcc offers a class for coping with stress ... this seems to be an oxymoron to me , but okay ... XD 
I've seen it all before , beauty and splendor torn : it's when heaven turns to black , and hell to white , right so wrong and wrong so right ... 
... is really rather fed up ... but my bedroom is even more colorful than before , so I shall endure ... it's like sleeping inside a kaleidoscope ... @_@ 
Where has Visual Bookshelf disappeared to ? * frets * I want my book list back ! It's like a < PROPMALE > bear , I don't need it for anything , it just makes me feel better ...

If you're in St. < PROPFIRST > tonight , it'll be a good time to watch Storm of the Century ; that movie's always best when there is snow piling up outside your windows . If a dude with a cane shows up at your door , just give him what he wants and he'll go away . 
So cool ~ The < PROPFIRST > bushes lining a stretch of my street are frozen solid , and the ice-ish snow falling from the sky strike the bowed leaves all over - the result is the sound of thousands of < PROPFEMALE > tinkling bells , like music coming from inside the bushes . \

No matter what you do , you can never make another person be happy . Only they can choose to be happy , and if they've chosen to be miserable , then no effort on your part can change that . Therefore , don't bear the burden of their misery as your own - choose happiness yourself . Maybe by your example they will finally learn how to find their own happiness .
