So i've been at my dads for about a week .. and for awhile i kept wondering where all my cloths went . ( everytime i shower i have to ask where my laundry is , they say they dont know where it is .. ) , apparently i found all my dirty laundry at the bottom of the laundry hamper . so i must ask , How come my step mommeh is always folding clothing and washing cloths , yet mine was never washed ? <__<; 
Thanks everyone for the wall posts ~ C ;
