is jus sayin he's on the noggin ...

knows she is not going in the right direction . But doesnt know what direction to go ... my crossroads . 
wishes everyone a Happy Thanksgiving and hopes everyone has oober fun ! 
It's amazing all the things that make up the puzzle . Too bad its not completed because I'm the missing piece . lol . 
I'm tired of being treated unequal because I'm a girl ... then they always say the same thing ... \society made it that way . \"" 
Is like wtf ... Boy do I live a crazy life ... I'm tripping my ownself out with the stuff i do .. haha . too bad I just dont care ... well a little but not about the right stuff ... well I'm getting ready for work and then goin over \his\ " house ... hmm ... "

I knew you wasnt going to wake up with me ... i found out my hair will be so much softer with just shampoo ... well i hope i see my < PROPFEMALE > today . idk though . oh and thnx 4 the great night . 
Everyday I live and try not to become a stereotype ... but somehow , one way or another , I do exactly what I wasnt on the track to do to become \typed\ " ... \ " But God ... \ " is what I have to constantly repeat to myself . <<??" 
officially likes the crawl song honey ... ily . lol ... took long enough . ;) 
bringing in the year with my family . looking at my beautiful daughter . she tryna talk to mama . i love her so much . Seabrooks <3 . 
wishes < PROPFEMALE > felt better ... those darn sinuses ... hmm ... its amazing how i feel about him ... i never thought i would get to this point after all the things I've done ... he's what I wanted and from having him he became a need in my life ... im in love ... what more ??? 
getting ready to go to sleep ... tired as all outdoors ... has a horrid headache ... hmm ... shoes ?? 
has caught a cold ... about to start my day . sneezing sniffing and blowing . really not excited about work tonight . hmm ...

has been sleeping a lot today . this stomach thing is killing me . tired of it . wanting to see < PROPFEMALE > . doesnt care who doesnt like that we express ourslves . only God can judge me . 
is just thinking its amazing how you can program your mind to think no matter what you are going to do the best for yourself . everyday now we sit and try to think how life is going to be and we say what we are not going to do and then we get further along and make messes even our parents or money could clear ... 
is just thinking its amazing how you can program your mind to think no matter what , you are going to do the best for yourself . everyday now we sit and try to think how life is going to be and we say what we are not going to do and then we get further along and make messes even our parents or money couldnt clear ... 
is so glad < PROPFEMALE > took that next step . I'm proud of him . My little man . 
People always mess up . Everyone wants to blame someone else . But maybe they should stop and think about their own . Dont sweep someone elses door step if your own is disgustingly dirty . 
well we constantly have to take what life throws at us . I'm greatful I dont get many curve balls ... life is still . : Basically : . what you make it . I'm making the most of mine . <3<3<3<3 
Dream-come-trues are not for everyone . < PROPFEMALE > tales do not happen everyday . Love_at_first_sight is debatable but is still more fiction than anything . So just live and make the most of this short time we have on Earth because we ignorantly take the gift of life , love , and ability for granted . :) <3<3<3<3 
Getting older only makes more problems . Situations with people become harder and experiences become ... 
one of tonights interesting topics in bible study : \Oreo sex . \ " thanks quay . " 
is just thinking on a comment made yesterday . Having a mate doesnt make you not lonely babe . You can have the things you need right within yourself . Sometimes having a mate can make you lonely because you're always going your separate ways . 
Hitting reality aint all that easy . All these little girls rushing trying to look older and be older , doing what \grown women\ " do . I'm still a young lady . past the little girl stage and working towards being an \ " successful\ " woman . Then some girls stuck on \ " hood . \ " \ " But I'm not bout that life . \ " So please dont try to lower me into yours . " 
I have a problem ... not quite sure what it is , but I always can sense it . Its like everyday it eats at me and automatically im irritated with not only people but with sounds from anything and movements I make myself . Sometimes I just want to sit there still , quiet , solemn , with my eyes open and see nothing but a blank world ... 
No matter who tried to get you down , no matter who tries to sabotage you , no matter who you thought your friends were , just remember God got your back ( and so does my mom ) . No one can ever take away a real relationship . She's always going to be my mama and she told me \You're always going to be my angel . Satan was an angel too . \ " i <3 mom . " 
Learned that even close family will turn on you . I watched that young girl suffer and no one see her pain . I watched everyone around her basically give up on her . I watched her be lonely for years and now I think its time for me to help her out until she can get off her feet again . everyone is blessed but some are just less fortunate . 
People think they know you . I'm glad I have this life I live even if I am sneaky . what 17 year old isnt ? I have so many more good traits than bad . I'm beautiful , intelligent , spontaneous , and mature . I dont have any babies . I'm going to college out of high school to live my dreams . And through all the things I've done , my mama still loves me and I love her and our one-of-a-kind relationship . :) 
Even when you dont want to smile , just do it because before you even realized it , that smile is real . Life bring storms but God brings joy . Lastly if you feel like someone wronged you , stop and think if hating them is appropriate for the crime . Most likely its not . 
It takes a lot to give up on something you fought to have and invested time into . Amazingly you can help shape and recreate \that thing\ " but still come out with the same results . You can walk out a door one day and literally walk into a world that changes your world . Somehow no matter how hard you strive the world takes away what you want the most and leaves you with what you started if not deprived of so much more . " 
Life aint always easy . As a matter a fact life isnt really ever easy . @ this stage its so much changin in us . Love walkin out the door . Minds over-loadin . Family constantly down ur back . \Friends\ " changin . Hormones up to the ceiling . @ this time we need more guidance 4 life than criticism . Evry olda person thinks they kno . Bt if their so wise y dont they c that we actually need their help w/o beating around the bush ? " 
Just received news : Now I see that just because you love someone and they tell you they love you back and buy you some items doesnt mean that they are true to you and do not want to hurt you . Beware of those you call \boyfriend\ " or \ " girlfriend . \ " They fake well to the point all you know is the fake them and not the true mind and heart . Here goes another case where a nigga messed up and now other guys have to suffer . " 
Baby < PROPFEMALE > , Baby < PROPFEMALE > , and Jari were absolutely beautiful today . I <3 them so much . Had a Happy Mothers Day even though I'm not a mother . Well I better get my rest I got lots of chumping tomorrow ahead of me . GN fbk . GN update . :) 
with a lot of things said and done ... a lot of people may look from a negative eye to me but at least I'm true . I love my damn near perfect life i'm living now . i am a cancer 24/7 . Ready to grow old already with those who care . I'm down < PROPFEMALE > . <3 you < PROPFEMALE > . 
came home today to my mama , toots , and jari poo . Babies are beautiful . <3 . Shoutout to < PROPFEMALE > . 
is ready to fulfill my dreams and desires ... ooh ooh ... 
My baby got out the fence this morning . I had to run in my nite clothes and catch her . < PROPFEMALE > jumps so high now . She gave me so many kisses and nibbled on my hands . That < PROPFEMALE > ! she's such a bad girl . But me and mama love our bad girl . 
A friend is a friend . No matter who their other friends are . No matter who talks down upon them . And a true friend would never try to make you choose or put you in a place where you have to . A friend will tell you when something is wrong and wouldnt want you to be harmed . A friend will take the blame for the other to save them . A friend is hard to find . 
One of the hardest things is to get into a relationship . Another hard one is keeping the relationship . Then breaking up is the easiest thing . But ultimately if you have that special love for that person the hardest thing is being apart from them . We always seem to forgive and then weep for weeks .. or months ( whatever your thing is ) . We hurt . We want them because now no one is filling that love space . You'll be alrite . 
misses my real innocent younger days playing with Sada < PROPMALE > and Dejene in the back of < PROPFIRST > on the thing we called a playground . sigh ... <3 ' n me but putting God 1st . nite fb . 
< PROPFIRST > adkins ! 
i look back on how i grew up and how my mama gave me the world and still does and I think about how I would be lost without her in my life . MAMA always been my mom , my friend , my confidante , my blessing , my guardian angel , my <3 . I thank GOD for her . MAMA is the only person that stuck by me my whole life even when I was dead wrong . She kept me on the straight and narrow . She's truly a one-of-a-kind mommy . i <3 her . 
just woke up now i got stuff to do . My babies coming to graduation ... yay ! 
Had oober fun last nite ... strait tripping out with everybody !

is appreciating a lot more things in life . I'm greatful for my life and how i choose to live it . I have the two best parents in the world , 2 brothers that love me dearly , An incredible immediate family who always make me laugh , a long distant confidante , and a friend thats always at arm reach . Now its time for me to branch out and learn to love those who try and harm me . Wisdom . 
is thinking ** some ** guys are so perverse with their brazen looks but oh so ignorant . <3 Seabrooks off . 
lets imagine this blank space then you wake up and realize it was reality . ** Seabrooks . ** 
brown eyes . 
Good things always seem to last just long enough for you to miss them so much ... 
never thought my cards would fall like this . Now I got the Jokers and high spades that will top both useless and useful books but I'm full of hearts that wont win me any books , lacking clubs that maybe would have helped me get around some hard times , and has just the right diamonds that are sitting just as gorgeous as ever in my hand but dont make me happy . With this I may win but its going to be a time . 
really wished Hangover was on right now ! \The Wolfpack . \ " _Allen . <3 " 
had great intentions for the latter part of the day but peoples pride and ignorance always seem to push me away . I rather be doing something useful . <3 
has to stop being selfless to help other people who wrong others . 
... and war begins . 
Fathers are forgotten by most just because they were raised without one . People look down upon men because they didnt have a manly figure helping to shape and mold them . Everyone always waits until fathers day to recognize that they even have one . Well what about those other days when hes at work laboring for your well being ? Thats when Thanking him would mean the most ! Seabrooks <3 
\My biggest lesson was learning to shut up . Fools never hear the truth anyway . \ " Seabrooks <3 . " 
another day to enhance this beauty ! Seabrooks <3 . 
... been a doll all day ... so time for transformers and lots of food !!! whoop whoop . Seabrooks <3 . 
They say actions speak louder than words . But I've heard words that will push you to murder . Seabrooks <3 . 
Some people just think they always right . Like they got all the answers . Cant tell them the sky blue . Grass is green . Water is wet . Those people will always be fools with that mind set . But its my place to utilize my wisdom and just ** SHUTUP ** alll over again . Seabrooks <3 . 
so soon people forget . Thats how you know fake . Seabrooks <3 . 
Apparently I dont get the friendship thing . I been watching guys take advantage of their so called best buds that was there for him when he was lamer than FILAs . and I've watched girls trade guys and be bestfriend . I was taught if you love someone your friend is off limits to him . But maybe I'm the foreigner . I just dont get it . Everything has been altered these days . Where are morals ??? Seabrooks <3 . 
Wow . So if something is for you , you will receive it . There is no getting around it . But its strange that you yourself can alter the < PROPMALE > of you receiving it just like you wanted it . Accepted and Denied . Crazy ! Its a blessing but I cursed myself . Seabrooks ?. 
Facebook is too personal . No one cares you got to work today . No one cares you don't have to have friends with your LONELY self . No one cares you found love . No one cares . Then changing your relationship status everyday . I would ashamed . Then you want to get mad because no one ever comments or likes your dumb statuses . Geeze < PROPFEMALE > . Write some worth mentioning . People swear they're so important . Seabrooks <3 . 
\Dream . \ " ... mine always come true . Seabrooks <3 . " 
sunday : Fat day . 
Stop sending me IMs if you need to tell me something txt me . If you dont have my number oh well and stop sending Friend suggestions because if those people want to be my friend they will send their own request . And if you got a problem just go head and delete me . Because I will happily delete everyone who does either . ( Just the nicest way to put it for these constant people sweetie . ) Seabrooks <3 . 
Partying is so much fun . So much like my mama . She didnt even know I could move this ole body so smooth .... SN : A boy and a girl cannot be ... I repeat cannot be best friends . There is more to it if they want to claim that title . The Wise ONE ! Seabrooks <3 . 
Love aint always smiles . But its always there . Seabrooks <3 . 
Females are a straight trip . They act the way they do and wonder why a guy always calling them \bitch\ " and \ " hoe . \ " Guys know how far they can go with a female . I dont blame those guys at all . Seabrooks <3 . " 
anticipation is a killer . :) Seabrooks <3 . 
Just because your hair or your weave pretty dont make you pretty girl . That make-up may have helped but you shouldve done some to that rough looking skin . The pictures people put on facebook and according to them they just so cute ... oh so sexy ... super fine ... the baddest . Facebook aint all bad it makes me laugh everyday . Seabrooks <3 . 
I hear a lot of talk from people regarding double standards . So if you hate them so much why are you the main person making up excuses for double standards ??? Just be real . Seabrooks <3 
Ewwlll ... old men are oober nasty ! I thought these little boys said some out of the way things . But those old men make me want to throw up . Ugh . grossed out for today ! 
Actually enjoys Plies ( song \Becky \") . Seabrooks <3 . " 
Mr. Goodbar sounds just wonderful ! Seabrooks <3 . 
Good morning . Someone just finished her Mr. Goodbar ... Now Toast and eggs sound worthy . Seabrooks <3 . 
Love . Peace . Honesty . :) Seabrooks <3 
Ritz crackers ... Ravioli ... collards ... chicken ... sounds like a great day ! Seabrooks <3 . 
Grow Up ! Thats what u need to do . Your life would be so much better if u did . When u grow up u dont have to worry about Where my boyfriend or girlfriend at . Or who u thought u could trust . When u grow up u realize u made a lot of things complex yourself and made your own life unstable . Maybe then u'll realize why you had to wonder where he/she was at and trusting \a friend\ " wouldnt be an issue . Seabrooks <3 . " 
Guilt is a chemical substance that eats at you slowly until one day others realize its breaking you down inside out . Seabrooks <3 . 
My daddy always tried to put deep inside me the thought : \the only words that should harm u would be the truth . Never let a rumor eat u because its a rumor for a reason . \ " In return I learned he was right . u would think others would know that words do hurt but u have to realize where are these words coming from ? A worried friend or a malicious enemy ? We all have both . We all have times when we are both . Seabrooks <3 . " 
Happy Birthday Me . I waited so long to just say I was 18 . Woo !!! Thnx to all my peps showing me bday love . Seabrooks <3 . 
I just wanted to thank everyone again for the bday wishes . Lets me know I'm not all evil . <3 . Had a wonderful wonderful day with my love ! Couldnt have asked for anything better than what he has given me ... Seabrooks <3 . 
wonders why when you're the baby of the family everyone has the hardest time letting you grow up a little . No matter how long they try to keep me a baby , I'm aging and learning more things on my own . Seabrooks <3 . 
I always felt like if things affect < PROPFEMALE > and cut < PROPFEMALE > deep or maybe just strike a nerve maybe < PROPFEMALE > should examine yourself before becoming hostile . Personally I've been becoming more aware of my flaws . But Flaws and All < PROPFEMALE > determine your greatness . Peoples words may scar but everything that is said to < PROPFEMALE > , about < PROPFEMALE > , for < PROPFEMALE > happens for a reason . Be strong . We all have to build our confidence . Jump on the wagon . Seabrooks <3 . 
People will never know how you feel even if you do take the time to express some things to them . Seabrooks <3 
sometimes you just get tired . Seabrooks <3 . 
Sometimes you have to get fed up with some things so you can address them . Because otherwise you would just keep a lot of problems to yourself that hindered you . Seabrooks <3 . 
I see those looking down upon me but nevertheless I still got way more going on for myself . People waited for something that they could talk about and somehow I'm still living a fairytale . I have all I wanted including my < PROPMALE > Charming and people in my life that I know love me unconditionally and that are teaching me how to love others more . Seabrooks <3 . 
When you love someone you step out on a limb sacraficing the most important part of you : Your heart . Secondly you sacrafice your peace of mind . Just because you love someone the fact doesnt go away that they won't hurt you , but you choose if they are worth that much . On a different note you are suppose to love everyone and forgive 7 times 70 times a day for the same wrong towards you . Seabrooks <3 . 
doesnt understand why people hate so hard . I been ** PHI ** get over it . Seabrooks <3 . 
Mission : Must clear her mind . \ 
Description : Too many thoughts in that big head of hers . Some thoughts become regrets and others become proud milestones in her life . But she would like to stop thinking so much . \ 
Concern : Her mind is overloading . Worriation could become too severe . \ 
Solution : ??? \ 
Seabrooks <3 . 
I dont care anymore what people have to say about me , about you , about US . We know what we got and it would take Flocka for me to walk away from you . I love this journey we're on . I smile a lot more than I ever did . Just the thoughts of all you've done for me makes me blush . My heart smiles ( and my belly moves all ) because of you . Ily < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Seabrooks <3 . 
\There's a hero 
love while you can . because if the time slips away , thats one thing no one else could have deprived you of doing . Seabrooks <3 . 
has so much lil kid in me that I never get to embrace and wont ever get the < PROPMALE > to either . Forced by nature to grow up so soon . I thought childhood would last a lot longer but i guess for the better I grew up and all so much faster . Seabrooks <3 . 
Getting ready for someone new to come into my life . Getting ready to totally cut off a few unexpected people . Getting ready to put SOME unimportant things aside . Getting ready to start a different kind of maturity . Getting ready for a whole new life . Ready to be happy ! We fail to realize people dont make us happy , happiness comes from within . So I'm starting with myself ! Seabrooks <3 . 
Why I cant go to the store without a guy staring me down ? Then he think I be interesting in him because I blush ! Half the time I be embarrassed . And dont let me have to walk in front of him and ( Lord forbid ) his perverted friends ... cause now I'm forced to listen to all the strange exotic things that they saying . You wouldnt even think I would still get that attention . But boy oh boy ... Seabrooks <3 . 
a simple kiss can make all the difference in your world . Seabrooks <3 . 
Life aint all that bad . Its the stages you go through that make you experience your worst nightmares . But most of the time you dealt yourself that bad hand . So now you got to play it and if you lose suck it up and get ready to redeem yourself ! SN : If you're in love you dont want to spend anytime without that person . you cant have the fun you want unless they are there . They help your world go around . Seabrooks <3 . 
little girls steady running in my face like we cool . we wasnt then and we definitely aint now ! I just choose to keep yall names out my mouth ! If you gon hate me do it proudly . I rather be hated publicly then think I'm being loved . Truthful enemy over a lying friend any day ! Far from stupid . Seabrooks <3 . 
This mornin I cried tears of happiness n sadness . Im so proud of so many . N extremely proud of u < PROPFEMALE > . All these years side by side watching each other make other friends and always returning to 1 another . I enjoyed last night n I didnt want to leave but I knew u had a busy day upon u ! Thanks for all the times u saved my hair ! Thanks for always helping if u could . And thanks for being there . Ur Sexy Red Bone . <3 . 
What can I say ? Things are wonderful . There is so much love , attention , and prosperity surrounding me at this point . The best part of my life I can say is enjoying it . Learning to smile when I dont want to and being nice when the world is against you is two of the biggest lessons I've almost mastered . I love my family and my jungle cat ... and I definitely love my lovebug and my love . Seabrooks <3 . 
\Asking Each Morning and Waiting Expectantly . \ " Let your will be done for us ! Seabrooks <3 . " 
being special enough for someone to go an extra mile for I must say is a wonderful feeling . U walked many extra < PROPMALE > for me . Just the thought of knowing all the cars that passed that didnt help u and then I came to the rescue because u tried ! Says a lot about u baby ! I observed u more than ever today . Im glad I blush when someone says ur name . I'm glad I still get that feeling when I say ur name . Seabrooks <3 . 
Some things people dont need to know about you ! No matter if yall are in love or are best friends or are relatives . But if the FACT ( meaning : its TRUE ) comes up ( I learned to ) just be real . Seabrooks <3 . 
sometimes days of laughter end in a night of tears . SN : Feeling extra moody . Might not want to cross this one . No mercy will be shown not even for anyone . Seabrooks <3 . 
No one can take your spot . No one can keep me from loving you but me . No one could possible have done a better job with me . And personally i dont want anybody but you . We holding strong together and it gives me so much hope but even more assurance . SN : people can get you down but its up to you to keep your head up . Just remember \ITS OK ! \ " when times get rough . Seabrooks <3 . " 
im waiting on the day . so unpatient ... Seabrooks <3 . 
... at this point I just want to scream . SN : What are we going to eat LoveBug ? * Rough Morning . * Seabrooks <3 . 
was looking for my 23 inch waist this morning and couldnt find it ! I really need to be finding that before 2011 comes along ... Seabrooks <3 . 
Males are a mess . Dont let them run over you but at the same time dont run over them . If yall cant come to an agreement then you may want to reconsider . But at the same time if the good outweighs the bad I say stick to it . No relationship is easy ! SN : up early and ready to go ! Looking pretty jazzy . Ooh I'm too sexy for my dress . Seabrooks <3 . 
One word : ** BAD ! ** Seabrooks <3 . 
Well dressed and refreshened , with this stupid nose bleed . ugh . but not going to let that get my panties in a bunch ! Getting my last things together . Looking Oober fine if I may say so myself . Hair right . Outfit right . Nails imperfected just like I like them . Make-up out of this world ! Stomach feeling like a trillion BUCKS ! Looking Good LoveBug . Time to ride ! Seabrooks <3 . 
loves little bitty dresses . Seabrooks <3 . 
a new day . woke up thanked God and been thinking about my < PROPFEMALE > . Ready to go to class . get it out the way . \ 
\You got me gone . \ " \ 
hungry with a tummy ache . am I suppose to head to the bathroom or the kitchen ? Seabrooks <3 . 
Ive realized my smiles are different and real more often . ** THEY ** make me smile . I'm waiting on her to come and give me even more smiles though . I'm not excited . I'm not ready . But I am happy . Seabrooks <3 . 
For all the males : Yes , we are still together ( look down at my relationship status ) . Yes , we are happy ( im pretty sure you already read my posts ) . No , you cant have my number ( I only text MY MAN ) . Finally , I'm overwhelmingly happy that you are not my \baby daddy\ " ( the right one is ) ... *^$%#^$%#$#%$%#$@#%$%#$%$#^%^% I swear not a day goes by something crazy is left in my inbox . Seabrooks <3 . " 
... and the best part was being held by you ... my love . Seabrooks <3 . 
I've learned if you are determined you can do whatever you got your mind to if its Gods will . Nobody can tell me I'm less than anything because I'm already more than I ever dreamed of . Just remember that . You are what you say you are . Seabrooks <3 . 
I'm excited !!!!! Being so impatient this morning . rushing the time until we see our lovebug . I'm just so anxious . For the 1st time in a long time she was a good girl at the doctor yesterday . very cooperative . That's mommy's little love bucket of joy ... I didnt think this would be our title so soon but I'm proud of it because we love her so much already ! Seabrooks <3 . 
feeling like Chocolate ice cream will suffice the night ... but dreading the waddle to the frig . But urge rules over how I feel ... I got to get it !!! Seabrooks <3 . 
is in pain ... lil love monkey has no mercy today ... Seabrooks <3 . 
everyday aint all laughs and smiles . days where nothing go wrong still dont make happiness fill the heart . the devil finds what makes you smile and deprives you of it before you even realize you lost it ... and you realize nothing then can make you smile but God . He holds every tear we have ever formed and knows every trial and tribulation we have faced , is facing , and will face . But God is love . Seabrooks <3 . 
i came in contact with this certain lady . She stared at my egg in disgust when she didnt know I was watching her then asked \Are you ready ? \ " ... and I replied \ " yea for you to get the ( bleep ) out my face . \ " No wonder pregnant people be mean sometimes . Seabrooks <3 . " 
sometimes you just learn to smile ... but at some point what lies behind that smile needs to be expressed ... Seabrooks <3 . 
You always want to hear you are loved ... especially by those you so deeply love . Personally I never get tired of hearing it . Seabrooks <3 . 
I couldnt let him see me cry so I fought the tears , I couldnt even let him hear a sniffle as he held me . It just felt so good for someone to be there . For someone that didnt have to be there to do it . He chose to hold me and ask me if I was ok . And I wasnt . I was so much better than that , I was overwhelmed with peace , love , and joy . It was like I was completely free ... Seabrooks <3 . 
Beauty comes from within . My beauty lies right on top of my bladder . Seabrooks <3 . 
Umm just wanted you to know ... I stole your necklace . Yep that means right now you're feeling for it and I have it around my neck ... I wanted to keep something that stays close to you . Seabrooks <3 . 
has had the longest day ever . Really out did myself today , SN : Old people get on my last nerve at this point . Just leave me alone . Seabrooks <3 . 
Ran up so many hills 2 tumble right back down the same path . Trying the same thing over 2 just receive the same results . Lying 2 myself so even I would believe it . I've only been on this journey a short while and I got a long way 2 go but in the end I learned I had 2 do things differently and now I make it 2 the top . Now my life reflects totally different results . Now I can believe the truth about me . Seabrooks <3 . 
Things change ... Seabrooks <3 . 
despises that no one wants to do things themselves and then they have the audacity to try and tell you how to do it . Just leave me alone if you going to complain to me about how I do things . Seabrooks <3 . 
loves that I feel this way at this point in my life about you . Seabrooks <3 . 
Sometimes Im nt myself . Im nt that < PROPFEMALE > that tells jokes , makes < PROPFEMALE > laugh , wants 2 have fun . Sometimes Im another person . I wont say a new < PROPFEMALE > on the account she will be gone away very soon . These last few months have brought many enemies as well as <3 ill < PROPFEMALE > 4 the rest of my life . I must say Ive been through some things I didnt want to experience but I'm glad I did because I learned so much . Seabrooks <3 . 
Speechless . I unexpectedly went into the hospital and came out with a gift from God . Like you told me the whole time through all my sleepless nights sickness pain and labor its going to be worth it . Its past that . Its so much better . Its another love I cant describe . Seabrooks <3 
so ... im feeling kinda tired but i cant sleep . < PROPFEMALE > taking all the sleep up ... guess on that note ill go eat some collards cornbread and chicken and dumplings then top that thing off with plenty of peach cobbler . So < PROPFEMALE > is getting her fruits and vegetables . Shoutout to my Gma . She tight . Seabrooks <3 . 
My lil twin < PROPFEMALE > went to the doctor today . She's perfect ! Seabrooks <3 . 
almost done losing weight . almost got my sexay body back ... cant tell me i aint tight . Aint that right < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ... Seabrooks <3 . 
So I'm getting myself back jazzy i fell off the last two days ... I have to remember dressing helps my attitude . So yes < PROPFIRST > , my appearance is what makes up a huge part of me . :) Seabrooks <3 . 
So blood is thicker than water ... but one thing I learned about being family ... you dont choose what family you want to be in except through marriage . So even though you share blood with people ... you can share water that means so much more . Seabrooks <3 . 
sometimes all you can do is cry after you've held back those tears for years . Seabrooks <3 . 
is still frowned upon for choosing him . Is still frowned upon for having sex . Is still frowned upon for getting pregnant . But refuses to be frowned uponed as a mother . I will not ! I chose to have this title and I will < PROPFEMALE > it out for me ... but mostly for my little Strawberry patch ... Daisy < PROPFEMALE > . Love conquers all . Love will make you change and I'm glad mine is for a great beautiful and wonderful cause . Seabrooks <3 . 
Im happy where I am . Forever his lady . Seabrooks <3 . 
love aint cheap . it comes with a price . Seabrooks <3 . 
had to wake up and stay up at 3 and play with Daisy ... she was so happy . Seabrooks <3 . 
a wonderful personality , slim waist , beautiful hair , and a gorgeous face . Must say .... sounds like a winner . SN : kinda enjoyed being at westside once again even though I wasnt with my class ... they had me rolling . Seabrooks <3 . 
watching my doll fall fast asleep . Seabrooks <3 . 
what i dont miss about bein in high school is the drama ... Ive never been so free from all the girls and guys whether i was the 1 talkin or bein talkd about . Lets just be real we all talkd about our share even if we were \mindin our own business\ " as we lied 2 ourselves ... you cant tell me you cant grow up over night . Its a choice . A life changin choice . I made it with help from my \ " Dear Lord Baby Jesus ! \ " Seabrooks <3 . " 
another setback ... sometimes crying is needed but my tears wont even flow because of hostility Anger Disgust Hate . Definitely got to keep prayin on this one because I might lose my mind . You dont play with peoples emotions whether they be your parent , your child , your mate , your friend . Be honest Be true Be considerate Love The things we take for granted . My heart so heavy i want to pull it out my chest . Seabrooks <3 . 
Love seems to be the most dangerous emotion . Once you love , it never dies , it only blossoms . I love you . Seabrooks <3 . 
oopsy < PROPFEMALE > . Seabrooks <3 . 
so in 2010 i had such a blessed year ... so many things happened in my life from rekindling old flames with my love to getting things right with an old friend . the birth of my beautiful nieces and the birth of my own little doll baby < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Mone ' . Getting my life on track to start my own family . Getting back right with God . Learning responsibility and being mature . Going to take a lot to top this year . Seabrooks <3 . 
today is < PROPFEMALE>'s 2 month birthday . Happy B-day little mama ... aww ... SN : sometimes tough love is needed . but it's just as hard for me to give than to receive . Seabrooks <3 . 
just love . Seabrooks <3 . 
really wished my < PROPFEMALE > felt better . Seabrooks <3 . 
so how do you put your trust in a liar that seems so true that you cant even believe they're a liar ? Seabrooks <3 . 
... so tell me why < PROPFEMALE > always feel like she got to look at what im doing on facebook and what im texting but won't pay attention when i try to teach her her sign language ? She stopped eating to turn and look who I was typing to then turned back around to eat again . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > i dont know what we going to do with this little girl . Seabrooks <3 . 
Why is it every guy i meet at school try to talk to me . as soon as we speak its always \you got a man ? \ " smh . today i must have been looking extra fine with my mini dress and boots on ... sN : i dont need or want a thug . I got Mr. < PROPMALE > and I can always take him home . Seabrooks <3 . " 
feeling a little on the down side . cant satisfy everyone . sN : if you dont want a truthful answer dont ask ... Seabrooks <3 . 
just like my mama and I were saying ... when you love somebody you can just sit all day in a blank room together and just love . we wish love really was that simple . hmmm ... Seabrooks 3 . 
The worst times to sit and look out the window to the world is when all you see are brown trees with a few leaves and a gray background we call the sky ... sN : i didnt know Like < PROPFIRST > would make me cry ... Seabrooks <3 . 
is having a strange day ... i was suppose to get 2 teeth pulled and left with all 32 and a numb mouth . then < PROPFEMALE > moping like she dont feel good . then im coming off this high with a migraine n a tooth ache ... sn : nervous about getting my teeth pulled next week . Seabrooks <3 . 
Lust isn't in the look , its in the thought behind the look . sN : money doesnt bring happiness , but love dont pay the bills . sN #2 : < PROPFEMALE > life , those around you , be grateful for how things are ... it could always be worse . But it's NOT ! So smile . Seabrooks <3 . 
Sometimes things just dont be looking good . money be just alright . people be irritating . school be stressful . Life be tiring ... but in the end you just got to keep your head up and live . sN : Things are easier said than done ... stressed out ! Seabrooks <3 . 
People always downing others because they might not have on Nike < PROPFIRST > Polo Juicy Gucci Coach wateva . Boy foolish people will down you about shopping at certain places ... i know its up to me to build my self-esteem . sN : So today < PROPFEMALE > showed me just how intelligent she really is . Large motor skills are on point !!!! Seabrooks <3 
I love listening to the rain .. my mind travels a million < PROPMALE > an hour . got < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > on the brain heavy . Seabrooks <3 . 
internal problem : forgiveness . What makes it so easy to not forgive is the fact they never apologized and some have laid too many I'm sorry's , that were from gettin caught up . sN : all burdens and secrets buried from the world . Seabrooks <3 
... and at that moment i knew we both had grown as lady and gentleman , partners , and parents . sN : Love feels like nothing felt before .. Seabrooks <3 . 
a heart is fragile but a mind is even more sensitive . after you tell yourself you're in love and things not going as according to the plan , you tend to flow away from your norm . sN : experience is a \female dog . \ " but oh so helpful if you learn . Seabrooks <3 . " 
sick as a dog today . broke my heart that i cant hold < PROPFEMALE > because I got a fever . sN : taking life a day at a time with purpose . Seabrooks <3 . 
I'm 18 . I'm going to start acting like it . I'm going to enjoy my youth . I'm going to become carefree once more . I still shouldnt have a worry in the world . I have a beautiful daughter and parents thats willing to take care of her so I can go to college and build a great life for us . sN : Realizing you can't say what someone else is going to do . You got to live for you . Seabrooks <3 . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I got our ears pierced today . She's even more beautiful . Truly my little angel faced doll . Seabrooks <3 . 
< PROPFEMALE > getting so big so fast . I'm really going to miss these days ... #She is my life . sN : Life is what you make it , so lets make it right . # < PROPFEMALE > be on some REaL ish . Seabrooks <3 .

I've declared i will be that engineer with a big home , my nice cars , my lovin husband , my wonderful daughter , my big dogs , my even bigger snake , and most all I will have my God first ! DECLARED ! sN : I love doing the right thing . Seabrooks <3 . 
So the truth is < PROPFIRST > Harris : the plan was to act mean but as soon as I saw your face all I could do was blush and smile . I love you so much baby . sN : M&M's are amazing . Seabrooks <3 .

If you dont put your all in something , you won't be disappointed when the outcome is negative . Seabrooks <3 . 
just because you just so happen got pregnant or got a female pregnant does not mean you are ready for the responsibility of being and carrying the real title of mommy and daddy . #too . many . fools . having . babies Seabrooks <3 . 
No im not perfect . Far from it . But that doesnt even phase her . I am her world . #love . is . Seabrooks <3 .

The bottom of my foot itching . The neck itching . Both are itches I cant scratch !!! ugh ! #nerve . racking . Seabrooks <3 . 
well guys just arent very romantic these days . They dont send flowers just because or go on picnics . They rather take you to a dumb game or to a cookout . Where is the quality time ? Where are the times we actually care about ? #affectionate . Seabrooks <3 . 
It seems like I have so many nights where he falls off to sleep and I'm the one left up to think about everything we said to one another . whether happy , sad , wonderful , depressing .. I seem to stay up hours later just thinking on so much . #mama . told . me . abou t.t hose . sleepless . nights . Seabrooks <3 . 
Now im tired of people saying the person they love completes them . I know < PROPFIRST > dont complete me . I was a whole and complete individual before we met . I won't say that I didnt mature and ripen as a person with him but no part of me was missing . And at the end of the day I would hate for us to be apart . I love my < PROPFIRST > . Seabrooks <3 . 
well for the 1st time my baby not at home with me ... all I can do is think about her . Its crazy because I leave her to go to school and little places . But I guess its just the fact that I'm sitting at home and my baby out even if she is with her daddy . lol . Mommy loves < PROPFEMALE > !!! #i . want . daisy . waisy . Seabrooks <3 . 
A broken heart is one of the hardest things to mend . sN : as soon as you declare something the devil comes and tries you . #I'm . going . to . win . Seabrooks <3 . 
Got to keep my head up and a smile on my face . I cant let the devil have me sad . This is a time to be happy . #got . to . have . faith . Seabrooks <3 . 
A part of love is being patient ... #ill . hold . you . down . Seabrooks <3 . 
I've been so stuck on trying to be with < PROPFEMALE > , my mama , and Dorian ... I lost < PROPFEMALE > . But I know now that she's close . I can feel her coming back . #Guess . who ? Seabrooks <3 . 
What should I eat ? sN : waiting on my interview . I got this job in the bag ! Sometimes it is who you know . ;-) and of course keeping my smile on my face and dressed to a T ! #i . know . an . important . hottie . WOO ! Seabrooks <3 . 
you know its priceless watching tv with 2 year olds . They catch every cursing and perverse word . And either they say \OOoooh he said a cursing word\ " or a few days later you hear s**t when they drop their cup . lol . #priceless ! Seabrooks <3 . " 
SEX is overrated ! sN : I realize now how unfair it is I brought < PROPFEMALE > in this cruel horrible world . #buying . my . gun . literally ! Seabrooks <3 . 
She feels like something is missing . Like all this time yall been slipping and steady tripping on one another . Like yall continuously cover the truth at hand . All she wants is for you to be her man . To stand firm in every situation but be willing to learn her as an individual . As a woman and definitely as a friend . #poetic . Seabrooks <3 . 
its a time to cry . I guess its my time . #tears . are . a . release . Seabrooks <3 . 
boy i see so many messed up babymama situations . Which is worse the sperm donor that left and aint fronting about the fact he aint taking care of his baby or the baby daddy that is around when he chooses every so often but fronts like his baby comes first ? #baby . mamas . got . it . rough . sN : I had fun at my niece party . Seabrooks <3 . 
well JUST LEAVE me the hell alone ! When you can treat me as your friend , ill be here . #unappreciated . Seabrooks <3 . 
it straight trips me out how people be liking your status because it may have some tight diction or inverted syntax but they dont know what any of it means . Seabrooks <3 . 
today guys got it rough . Their temptation is beyond our imagination . They got females everywhere legs already open . Naked pics on fb . Females grabbing on them every < PROPMALE > they get . And they're not hiding anything . I will admit I played my own games when I didnt have a life . But how can you say you a woman or a lady and you being a FREAK . #so . beyond . that . Seabrooks <3 . 
dont depend on people ... they claim they care ... then they leave you and your baby out there in the open running around macon . #bit . got . me . bent . Seabrooks <3 . 
i just want to sleep this all away . pray < PROPFEMALE > . PRAY ! If I couldve foreseen this I wouldnt be here ! But I'm here because of choices I made which were wrong . ugh . stupid < PROPFEMALE > . right now i could careless about a friend , family , school , campaigning , Right now im holding us in my arms happy she doesnt have to know what our individual person has to face . #another . restless . night . Seabrooks <3 . 
Well at the end of the day I can smile ... because even though I did some things today I am not proud of I dont have to worry . Well at least I'm not going to worry ... because I'm going to do me . whoever that is ... #Who ? Candice . Ann . sN : its going to take a lot more to tear me down . Seabrooks <3 . 
I want to go out but it looks like I will stuck another friday at the house because < PROPFEMALE > won't suck a bottle . :/ ugh . Its crazy my disadvantage isnt having a baby its how spoiled I got her . #i . owe . her . the . world . Seabrooks <3 . 
Truth is I'm shallow . If u half way know me u should know that . I discriminate . I'm nice smilin < PROPFEMALE > 2 every1 but I hate talkin or bein around ugly people . At least the 1s I feel are ugly . In my book no1 has 2 be ugly it is a choice . So if its ur choice 2 be ugly I shall continue keepin my distance because I wont hear a word u say . I only look at the fact u not takin care of urself . #Confession . Seabrooks <3 . 
finally went out ... now the club itself wasnt all that but I loved dancing in my baby's arms . He loved it too . #got . me . started . Seabrooks <3 . 
The gift giveaway was a hit . All my clothes and what not are GONE !!! So now I just got to get up some more stuff to give out personally . i like giving stuff away . #my . good . deed . Seabrooks <3 . 
No I dont have the answers . I dont practice everything I preach . I dont do most things Im told . Idc about your feelings . I dont tell the truth all the time . But Im ready 2 change some of this . Im ready to be a new person but I keep falling into the same things . Got 2 do things different . As soon as I start doing right all my temptations come my way and I fail every test put in front of me . #weak . vessel . Seabrooks <3 . 
just cuz its cold doesnt mean its ok 2 bomb 2 skool . Pajama pants never look like real pants so y wear them 2 kroger and walmart ? Bedroom shoes are made 4 the house and old ladies after church . Scarfs on your head when you out dont even look like part of your outfit . When you wear your night clothes to school BRUSH YOUR FUNKY mouth and WASH YOUR FACE at least ! #mama . taught . me . better Seabrooks <3 . 
< PROPFEMALE > just be rolling over everywhere and whining about food all the time . She so fast ! I'm going to always < PROPFEMALE > this time . #my . little . angel . Seabrooks <3 .

i dnt feel good tonight fb ... between these pains and this sickness I swear I'm ready to cry . Ugh . < PROPFEMALE > sleep thank God . Mommy dont feel like playing tonight doll face ! * sigh * #feeling . my . worst . Seabrooks <3 . 
everyday you look in the mirror . sometimes you like the person staring back and sometimes you dont . That person in that mirror convicts and judges you more than any enemy . That person praises and lifts your spirits better than any friend . That person isnt always who you want it to be . But you made that person and that person is YOU . #lookin . back.at.me . Seabrooks <3 . 
Sometimes I can honestly say I hate the image I portray . Sometimes I wish people only knew the naughty < PROPFEMALE > and other times I wish they only knew the kind hearted < PROPFEMALE > . If I kept it 100% on how I felt my actions would totally contradict one another . #Can . the . REAL . Ann . please . stand . up ?? Seabrooks <3 . 
i wonder why as females we must endure these hardships ... Seabrooks <3
