Feliz 2011 a todos mis amigos 
Recibí el año con trabajo , con dinero y sin amor . ¿Que mas me espera este año ? 
My thyroid is not doing pretty well . I hope to get normal before summer . Anybody knows what's going on in the world , besides earthquakes and volcanos , and massacres accross the border ? 
First weekend at poncho's . So far so good . The treatment is not bad 
May ?? We are already on May !!!! This year is going super fast . 
Three long days of work on mother's day . Jesus ! I took a big break . What a marathon of gigs !!!!! 
what's up with all of this farmville stuff ???!!! 
Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did . 
My stomach hurts , and It's time to go to work . I am still having problem running the particle system in my animation software . Computers are slow . 
We do not fall in love with beautiful people ; we find them beautiful because we love them 
I got food poison . No work until further notice . 
Just finishing some workout . Jesus ! I am totally out of fit . 
Everything is something you decide to do , and there is nothing you have to do . 
As far as the filmmaking process is concerned , stars are essentially worthless - and absolutely essential . 
wow ... Ya empezo el mundial !!!! 
Y eso que tenemos nuestras patas de conejo ( Pérez ) . Aun no metemos ni < PROPFEMALE > , animo México que pex 
GOOOOOL !!!!!!!!!! 
GOOOOL !!! arriba cuahutemoc 
Is arranging all my music in iTunes 
Try to play the trumpet with one hand and hold an umbrella with the other , and wind fighting for bending your umbrella . And it's not cirque du solei ... it's not even funny 
working out at home 
Pick up a camera . Shoot something . No matter how small , no matter how cheesy , no matter whether your friends and your sister < PROPFEMALE > in it . Put your name on it as director . Now you're a director . Everything after that you're just negotiating your budget and your fee . -- James < PROPFIRST > 
cooking for my dad . XD 
Life isn't about finding yourself . Life is about creating yourself 
A day like today but in 1986 at 00:40 hours a boy called < PROPMALE > Yonathan Orta Rodríguez was born . HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MYSELF !!!!!! \

come into a final realization that his interpersonal relationships in his daily life is not working properly as he expected it . Proof , a year after his graduation date ; nothing has been succeeded except a diploma and no calls of graduates mates for working on projects . :-( 
It was a high counsel that I once heard given to a young person , \Always do what you are afraid to do . \"-- Ralph < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
A veces pienso si en verdad tu me aprecias . A veces quiero saber por que no nos entendemos o por que no convivimos en < PROPFEMALE > . A veces quiero saber que piensas y que sientes . Y por que a veces somos tan diferentes que aun asi nos llevamos tan bien . 
??... Quiero que se me borren todas las penas que me dejo < PROPFEMALE > quien yo adoraba y sin embargo me abandonó . \ 
Cartas retratos viejos hacen mas triste mi < PROPFEMALE > por que me traen recuerdos de horas felices que no vendrán . \ 
Cruzan por mi memoria sus juramentos sus falsedades que pa’ mi siempre fueron verdades pero que hoy traiciones son ..?? ¡¡¡¡Tambien de dolor se canta cuando llorar no se puede !!!! 
The other night I ate at a real family restaurant . Every table had an argument going . 
en mi compu no veo < PROPFEMALE > solo audio 
“Making movies is a little like walking into a dark room . Some people stumble across furniture , others break their legs , but some of us see better in the dark than others . The ultimate trick is to convince , persuade . Every single person out there is an idiot , but collectively they're a genius . ” < PROPFIRST > Wilder 
Another week of work . What everybody is gonna do this week ? 
de que disfrazo este Halloween ? 
Love is blind , marriage is the eye-opener . 
the swap of this weather just got me sick . I'm coughing with a horrible infection . 
just celebrated my mom's birthday at Costa Messa ... and I'm still sick . LOL :-)

The difference between someone who finishes anything and someone who just wants to do something but can not get it done , is the simple act of stopping too soon 
I am starting to miss a classroom 
I am not a entrepreneur , and I haven't made big bucks from my career . Therefore , unless we have more than 17 years apart , don't dare to call me Mr. Orta .

About two months ago I left a bag doritos at a building . Guess what ?... Today , I returned to the same the building and I found the doritos the same place I left them . I wonder if they still taste fresh .

Watching \Presunto Culpable\ " . It gives me goosebumps to see how easy -- by just pointing a finger -- is to end up in jail at Mexico "
