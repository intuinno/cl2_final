is thinking/singing/feeling \After Today\ " and \ " Almost There\ " . ( Hint they're both Disney ) . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all and to all a good night . HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE . 
Is alive ....? KH BBS is insane , but Aqua is amazing . 
hates new facebook . God , why do you keep drastically changing ? 
I have 200 friends ? Lol , what ? 
feels like she has been under attack thanks to facebook events . But is thankful for all of the birthday wishes , and will try to get to every comment individually . :D 
Can't wait till school is over so prop guns can be made for Fanime . ( Well at least a pistol and a knife ) . 
officially was not meant to hold a CAL ID for more than 5 mo . -1yr . 
misses Sex & the City , her cats , and her car . > < 
hates that she is kind of OCD because this gun would be made so much faster . >.< 
still not done with foam prop gun pattern because of OCD attention to detail , but the barrel has been sketched . 
has completed the prop Beretta pattern and has traced it onto the craft foam ; tomorrow she had better NOT cut her hand with the box cutter . 
the profile pict has finally changed ! Now featuring < PROPMALE > Langdon and < PROPFEMALE > Dyer . 
is excited that < PROPMALE > Langdon and now < PROPFEMALE > Dyer will be at Fanime again ! And also wonders if they'll feel like she is stalking them as she will turn up as Sheva again .... 
Fanime : \ 
Friday- J-pop inspired ( ie . Namie Amuro)\ 
Sat- Sheva Alomar <3 \ 
Sunday -Sheva Alomar ( RE GATHERING FTW ! )\ 
Mon- Normal Clothes 
Jury Duty is boring . That is all . 
is about to kick into AX mode . 
For all intents and purposes , my PSP is dead . It turns on , but the speakers don't work and now it barely reads my games , not to mention the battery will shut off if I touch the UMD door wrong . : tears : But < PROPFIRST > is excited for < PROPFEMALE > vs . Capcom 3 and Street Fighter X Tekken . 
Has replaced her old dead PSP with a new one thanks to Mom . : heart : 
BLEACH 414 = WTH . > < 
technically hasn't started the < PROPFEMALE > Fang cosplay , but is already overwhelmed by it . God , cornrows ! 
is leaving for Hawaii at 12:00 and will have no internet ( unless a certain hotel has computers ) so don't comment unless you can wait till Friday . Evening . 
is home and happy to see her kitties . But will miss them when she leaves in a week . 
is in Berkeley . Call , text , or fb if you want to < PROPFEMALE > before classes . 
just realized the reason a cosplay friend hasn't added her yet is because she couldni't be searched for on Facebook . >.< 
? Taku Takahashi = musical genius . 
annoyed that < PROPFEMALE > seems to think < PROPMALE > people spending money will end economic crisises . 
Just shared a plane ride with the cool kids from St. Mos . I'm looking at you Nghia-Piotr Trong < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . > D 
Fang stuff has been purchased . 20% still needed for costume . 
Has IP Fang photos on the iptouch that Facebook won't let me upload . (???´) 
Believes Fanime 2011 will see her with more than 10 safety pins . 
Booo new facebook . One more day . All I wanted was one more day .. 
JUN is in my TEKKEN TAG 2 ! YES PLZ !! :D 
Thanks for all of birthday wishes everyone ! 
Is a little sad/gloomy/frustrated that her Persona 3 game data was overwritten . 
Feels sucker punched by Sucker Punch . Watch for the action people . Snyder really hates women ....
