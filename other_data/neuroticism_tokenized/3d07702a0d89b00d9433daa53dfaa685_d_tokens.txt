I don't need this menu , no I don't , I already know just what I want , did I hear you right , did you tell me , go pay the waiter and lets leave , now < PROPFEMALE > I know by that look in your eyes , and your hand drawing hearts on mine , that our night out of the house , ain't gonna last too long , when all you can think about , is getting me home , [ Chorus ] 
well i cleaned my room yesterday . it feels so clean and empty im just not used to it at all . it took me like forever , but somehow i got it all done in one day . little does anyone know it will eventually end up again completely trashed ..... lol . i guess ill just enjoy it being clean for now ;)

after much thought on what word i should use to describe my feelings and/or mood i came up with this : apprenhensive . 
feeling apprehensive hoping that maybe just maybe something super awesome will happen ..... not sure yet tho ... 
JOKE OF THE DAY : A millionaire , a hard hat , and a drunk are at a bar . When they get their beers , they notice a fly in each mug . The millionaire politely asks the bartender for another beer , then proceeds to sip it . The hard hat spills out just enough to get rid of the fly and quaffs the rest . It's now the drunk's turn . He sticks his hand into the beer , grabs the fly by the wings , and shouts , \Spit it out ! Spit it out ! \"" 
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY EVERYBODY !!!!! <3<3<3
