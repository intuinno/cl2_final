Buzz Lightyear was my man back in the day 
Like my status , and I'll tell you what I like about you , dislike about \ 
you , and my first impression of you . I'm so late on this :p 
I LOVE YOU WIKIPEDIA ! 
I've gone for too long living like I'm not alive , so I'm going to start over tonight . Beginning with you and I . 
Human beings were originally \ 
created with four arms , four legs , and a single head with two faces . Fearing \ 
their powers , Zeus split them into two parts ; condemning them to spend \ 
the rest of their lives in search of their other half . 
No one's following me on Twitter . Gahlee I need friends -______- 
You suck . 
I'm gonna make this essay my bitch . 
I damn near had an asthma attack . 
I dislike how everyone is suddenly trying to be like Holden Caulfield . t.t 
What's with people updating every detail of their life ? That's what Twitter's for ! 
Everyone click ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ob=av3e 
So , this might sound like solicitation , but I kinda need people's addresses ? haha I'm having a diez y siesanera and I'd like to mail out invitations . : b 
Mmm , just made some bomb ass cupcakes son ! 
5 hours and the left side of my mouth is still numb . I hate the dentist . 
It's funny how you reply to everyone else but me . Now what does that say about your character . I'm starting to realize that I don't like you very much . 
Damn , 10 month anniversary . shieeeeet . : b <3 
I might actually commit to something this week . Let's see if I can dance haha . 
Hey ! I'm not sore ! :D 
Geez , everyone's birthday is in October . 
I got stung by a < PROPFEMALE > on my middle finger . How Ironic haha . 
Disappointed . 
Free pumpkin spice latte FTW ! Thank you supah asian brother of mine . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Levitt ;) 
I really wanna slurpee :/ 
New word for vagina : Muffcake 
I wanna dip it low like < PROPFEMALE > Milian ! 
Sat test tomorrow . Ewwww . 
You trick your lovers that you're wicked and divine . You may be a sinner , but your innocence is mine . -Muse 
Some say it's all fate , but I say we control our lives . And if my < PROPFEMALE > should outbest me then that's fine . I make believe thrill and apathy co-exist in me fairly equally . The truth is doubts are all I've got to call mine . -Bayside 
#56 Well this girl is freakin gorgeous ! She's one of the nicest and strongest people I know . She's an incredibly good writer and she's really funny . And not to mention she has the biggest boobs in the world ! haha I love you ! 
#707 You're the only panda known in Fresno and you're all mine ! :D You honestly make me happy and I freakin ' love you . <3 
#14 Um , pretty much the sexiest asian alive ! She's one of the coolest people I know and she's beautiful inside and out . She's a damn good friend and she'll always be there to help you . This girl means a lot to me . She's a ride or die homie ! :) I love you ! 
I like how suddenly now everyone is a Raider fan . And you all talked shit on me last year . Bitches -___- haha 
The starlight . I will be chasing your starlight . Until the end of my life . I don't know if it's worth it anymore . -Muse 
Miley < PROPMALE > caught on camera smoking from a < PROPFEMALE > . It was only a matter of time haha . 
If you always do what you've always done , you'll always get what you've always gotten . 
You let me down . 
The best part of waking up , is mother fuckin ' Folgers in your cup ! 
Screw the new horoscope change . Even though the alignment is now different , it wasn't when you were born . So every one is really still the same zodiac sign . Only people born after the < PROPFEMALE>'s profound gravitational pull should go by the new zodiac signs . I'm staying a Libra god dammit ! haha 
I wish I had money to go to formal :/
