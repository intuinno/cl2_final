This year looks like it might be alright afterall . 

Do we make it up as we go along ? 
The sun on your face ; I'm freezing that frame . 
< PROPFEMALE > up . A happy mask was never your best disguise . 
Feeling radical in cotton , and purified in my satin . 
We could be bouncing off of clouds today . 
Had the time of my life on mother's day . I was shopping for bikinis with my new heartthrob . 
Looking forward to lay-off real soon ! Yea , let freedom ring !!! 
If anyone has a baby crib they want to get rid of , < PROPFEMALE > still needs one . She is due in August ! < PROPFEMALE > is due to have her baby within the next 10 days . :-) 
Everysingle one of you are on my Friend \ 
list is a result of a consciousdecision . I am not only glad to count\ 
you as friends but also asfamily !. 
Went to see Double Shot Saturday night . Danced my butt off ! 
Just taking care of my new grandbaby . Smile from me ! 
Scraping popcorn style texture off a ceiling is not as easy as it looks ! 
Health\ 
is the greatest gift , \ 
contentment the greatest wealth , \ 
faithfulness the best relationship . Buddha 
As\ 
yesterday is history , and tomorrow may never come , \ 
I have resolved from this day on , I will do all the \ 
business\ 
I can honestly , have all the fun I can reasonably , \ 
do all\ 
the good I can willingly , and save my digestion\ 
by thinking pleasantly . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Stevenson 
The\ 
real work that brings about awakening , rather than merely \ 
granting\ 
the external appearance of “being spiritual , ” while actually\ 
embroiling\ 
us ever more deeply in the dream , , daily \ 
commitment to\ 
the identification and elimination of every self-serving\ 
belief\ 
from which our personal dream-lives are constructed . 
us ever more deeply in the dream , is a daily \ 
Worry\ 
is responsible for more disease than all the germs\ 
that exist on the face of the earth . \

Happiness ? \ 
It is an illusion to think that more comfort\ 
means more happiness . Happiness comes of the\ 
capacity\ 
to feel deeply , to enjoy simply , to think freely , \ 
to risk life , to be needed . \

Too\ 
often we underestimate the power of a touch , a \ 
smile , \ 
a kind word , a listening ear , an honest \ 
compliment , \ 
or the smallest act of caring , all of which have\ 
the potential to turn a life around . \ 
Leo\

Awareness\ 
means the capacity to see a coffee pot and\ 
hear birds sing in one's own way and not\ 
the way one was taught . \

The difference\ 
between what we do and what we are\ 
capable of doing would suffice to solve\ 
most of the world's problems . \

< PROPFEMALE>'s baby shower is July 25 , 2:00 pm . at the park in Bolivar . 
Material\ 
possessions are often a hindrance toward attaining\ 
higher consciousness . They take a cunning delight\ 
in\ 
becoming one's master while appearing as a \ 
benevolent\ 
slave . \ 
Shantidasa 
The hardest thing to believe when you're young\ 
is that people will fight to stay in a rut , \ 
but not to get out of one . \

One of the greatest lessons in life is \ 
learning to be happy\ 
without the things we cannot or should not have . \ 
< PROPFIRST > L . Evans 
whole idea of compassion is based on a keen awareness\ 
of the interdependence of all these living beings , which \ 
are all\ 
part of one another , and all involved in one another . \ 
Thomas\ 
Merton 
Failure is one of God's educators . It is experience leading\ 
people to higher things ; it is the revelation of a way , \ 
a path hitherto unknown to us . The best people in the\ 
world look back with serene happiness on their failure . \ 
< PROPFIRST > G . < PROPFIRST > 
logic of worldly success rests on fallacy :\ 
the strange error that our perfection depends on \ 
the\ 
thoughts and opinions and applause of other \ 
people . \ 
Merton 
Life begins for anyone when that individual refuses to be\ 
a victim of any delimiting experience : disease , accident , \ 
poverty , family pressure , marriage dilemma , neglect . Whatever\ 
the curse , if you will not take it , or accept the role fate seems to offer , you can never become a mental cripple and nothing can hold you back . \

You may not have \ 
saved a lot of\ 
money in your life , but if you have saved a lot of\ 
heartaches for other folks , you are a pretty < PROPMALE > person . \

We act as though comfort and luxury were\ 
the chief requirements of life , \ 
when all that we need to make us really happy\ 
is something to be enthusiastic about . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Kingsley 
There is no true and constant gentleness without humility ;\ 
while we are so fond of ourselves , we are easily offended\ 
with others . Let us be persuaded that nothing is due to us , \ 
and then nothing will disturb us . Let us often think of our own\ 
infirmities , and we shall become indulgent towards those of others . \ 
Francois Fenelon 
Most\ 
people ask for happiness on condition . \ 
Happiness can be felt only if you don't set any \ 
conditions . \ 
Artur\ 
Rubinstein 
Happiness\ 
is the greatest paradox in nature . \ 
It can grow in any\ 
soil , \ 
live under any conditions , defies environment ... does not come from without but from \ 
within ... people seeking happiness outside themselves , \ 
they\ 
have never yet found it . \

Text From < PROPFEMALE > at specialist's office : Baby's great ! And she thinks he's negative ( rH factor ) and no amniocentisis and she's letting me go to 38 1/2 weeks ! :) 
What \ 
can any of us do with our talent but try to\ 
develop\ 
our vision , so that\ 
through frequent failures we\ 
may learn better what we missed\ 
in the past . \

Remember , a small trouble is like a pebble . \ 
Hold it too close to your eye and it puts everything out\ 
of focus . Hold it at proper viewing distance and it can\ 
be examined and classified . Throw it at your feet and see it\ 
in its true setting -- just one more < PROPFEMALE > bump on the pathway . \

Life isn't about how you survived the storm ... it's \ 
about how you danced in the rain !

Life is religion . Life experiences reflect how one interacts with God . \ 
Those who are asleep are those of little faith in terms of their \ 
interaction with the creation . Some people think that the world exists \ 
for them to overcome or ignore or shut out . For those individuals , the \ 
worlds will cease . They will become exactly what they give to life . 
The United States , locked in the \ 
kind of twilight disconnect that grips dying empires , is a country \ 
entranced by illusions . It spends its emotional and intellectual energy \ 
on the trivial and the absurd . It is captivated by the hollow stagecraft\ 
of celebrity culture as the walls crumble . By : y : < PROPFIRST > Hedges , a Pulitzer \ 
Prize-winning reporter for the New York Times 
It is not death that we should fear , but we\ 
should fear never beginning to live . \
