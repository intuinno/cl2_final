Then they discovered the problem - a 12 year old boy was standing up the road with a hand-painted sign , which read ‘SPEED TRAP AHEAD’ .

If i were President , I would have a nonformal vote to decide on whether or not there should be a ' mosque ' within the vicinity of ground zero .. however , if you do not permit one church group from being in this vicinity to be fair you should not permit ANY church group from being in this same vicinity . This I think would be the most constitutionally accurate way to handle this . 
Raise your hand if you are stumbling at the moment :]
