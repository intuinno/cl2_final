Time to start packing up the belongings . * sigh * I can't believe its over .

I don't know what she is up to but I do not like it one bit . At least she gave me my glasses . * puts pen and home made file down * What makes that woman believe she has purchased me . That is just preposterous .

Getting shipped off to Phoenix on the 23rd . It'll be awesome but ... I REALLY HATE buses . I really really do . It's not the distance or the time it'll take to get there . It's the bus itself .

“It’s because < PROPMALE > was watching Ahni . He probably saw < PROPFIRST > in town while he was watching her . If that’s the case , that’s probably how he found me as well .

They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and they don't hold grudges .
