thanks heaven that the facebook polls app is glitchy , or he'd be stuck on there all day . @__@ 

likes to update his status such that his name is included in the first sentence . =D 
is going to stay off facebook for a while . 
has been stuck on a life -> car-trip metaphor . I've decided that the best way to go is to just try to learn as much as I can about how other people drive and my own vehicle , so that eventually I can drive with speed and finesse , so I can get places faster and without spending as much fuel or crashing as often/badly . Note : < PROPFIRST > Brown convinced me to post this . Blame him for it . 
Why can't you have egg , bacon , sausage , and spam ? It doesn't have as much spam as spam , egg , sausage , and spam ! 
I'm off to bed now . For when the rest of you guys go to bed : remember to tap down repeatedly while in bed to sleep . And don't lose your pace when you get drowsy , or you might wake up ! 
See \Chases\ " on pages 216-217 for details of collisions . " 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status and the FIRST entry for your name under comments . 
Just to make it < PROPFEMALE > clear , I rarely pay any attention to * any * of my invites , requests , etc ., on FB . It's not because I don't like you . It's because I don't like facebook in general that much . I like this site because of how many of my friends are accessible through it , not all the random groups and applications .... 
In case you need/want it for w/e reason , my cell phone number is ( 817)-861-0946 . Calling is preferred over texting , if I'm not in class ( I won't answer a call or reply to a text while in class , but I can reply to texts after class is over ) , and I'm never in class this semester after 2:30 on Mon/Wed , 2:00 on Tues/Thurs , or 10 AM on Fridays . 
lmfao , I must have been nine kinds of crazy when I wrote my last status . I put my home phone instead of my cell . My cell is ( 817)-946-3258 . 
Hm .... Moral thought ( just my opinion , but still ): The only things that can be argued as morally ' bad ' are those that cause emotional , physical , financial , intellectual , or spiritual damage or suffering to another person ( or living creature , if you prefer ) , with the consistent exception of suffering/damage caused by violating the moral values of others which are not based on this principle . 
For those whom aren't already aware , I'm in Boston for spring break ! Sorry I forgot to say anything sooner , but yeah . It's fun . I'm visiting my sis ' . And I may sit in on a couple MIT classes . And stuff !! ... I think I'll go to bed now . I'm sleepy . 
So , I'm back from Boston . I had a good time . I met some cool people . I ate some tasty food . ... I had fun . =P 
FACEBOOK has a new way of sharing your personal info : As of today , there is a new privacy setting called \Instant Personalization\ " that shares data with non-facebook websites and it is automatically set to \ " Allow . \ " Go to Account > Privacy Settings > Applications and Websites > Instant personalization and uncheck \ " Allow\ " . Please copy & repost . " 
can't find his cell phone . Contact me through Facebook or by e-mail , or if you must , you can call the house phone , if you know it . 
WOO ! After cleaning the house today , I have found not only my phone , but also my wallet ! ^^ 
Name change ! Back to the old now . I suppose a lot of my friends don't even know I ever went by < PROPFIRST > .... It's my middle name , in case you're curious . 
So , my phone has been missing since sometime Friday , and I can't seem to find it anywhere . In the meantime , contact me via my home phone , Facebook PMs , or e-mails . I'll let you know when I find it . 
Thank you all for the happy birthday wishes . To anyone wondering , I didn't really make any plans for a party or anything . Also , my cell phone is still lost . xP 
\Quiddity\ " is my new favorite word . xD " 
My mother is an information control officer for a hi-tech government research facility . O_O 
I got a new phone ! Same number as before . Don't text me though . I can do calls , but texts are no longer in the plan . 
Hey , friends at UTA ... who's a good professor for ENGL 1301 ? Describe the professors you've had . 
Do you like my code ? it's a pretty awesome code , if I do say so myself . --> > ' 8 y8 l46 < m46 < 7>' ? 3 > * 5 ) r0 > 6 4*5m < 7>' , 3/ 46 > ' 8 * 26 * 7 m46*2l/ . \ 
... \ 
Okay , I got a little lazy with some of it ( I didn't do anything to n , m , l , r , w , or y , for the most part ) , but it's an amusing little something . It's a different kind of code than the usual things you see , that's for sure ....
