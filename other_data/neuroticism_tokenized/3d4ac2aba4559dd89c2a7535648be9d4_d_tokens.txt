No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status

Very dramatic today , a pervert was looking at a 12 yr old girl in the subway . the mom fliped and start screaming , dramatically , a cop was standing near by , he came by and drive the perv off train ... and then the train delay for 15min .... someone on the train identifys the perv and know he's a teacher . i think they should kick him to jail right away .... for the sake of the kids .. =.= 
It's not discipline , willpower , or pressure from others that facilitates adherence to a challenging course of action . Rather , it is the freedom to choose among alternatives , the personal commitment to a mission , and the willingness to take responsibility for the consequences of our decisions that steels the will and emboldens the spirit .
