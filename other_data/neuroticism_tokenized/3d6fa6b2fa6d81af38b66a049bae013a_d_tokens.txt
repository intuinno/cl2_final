Anyone can give up , it's the easiest thing in the world to do . But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart , that's true strength . 
I , with a deeper instinct , choose a man who compels my strength , who makes enormous demands on me , who does not doubt my courage or my toughness , who does not believe me naive or innocent , who has the courage to treat me like a woman . 
i'm going going back back to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE >
