town today . And last month the Duggar family came . See , it's a hoppin ' place !

tomorrow's midterm isn't going to cheer me up very much :( . 
has nerve damage :/ 
Like my status and I'll tell you : \

while walking down DOG street and have to say , \don't worry about the \ 
there's no place like home , there's no place like home , there's no place like home . 
is very thankful for her wonderful friends and family <3 
SOOOOOOOOO MUCH WORK ..... yet motivation lacks . Where is it ?!?!? 
doesn't want to go back to school . Going back means I REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY need to work hard/ catch up on all the work I procrastinated on during Thanksgiving break !

SO BUSY !!!!!!! < PROPMALE > of < PROPFEMALE > is absolutely killing me , but I gotta find time to go to Colonial Williamsburg to see Grand Illumination tonight ! :)

i . hate . my . life . :'( 
HOLY-\MOLEY\ " CHEMISTRY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't WAIT to be done with this exam ! " 
my cat states the mantra of my life currently : \meh \"" 
loves being home , but misses her w&m friends sooooooooo much !!! 
black swan was SUPER weird , but at least I was reunited with Vandana Kumar <3 
Lobster Pie and snuggled up , watching some crazy television with my family must be an omen for a wonderful Christmas 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , Everyone !!!! 
Happy New Year everyone !! Enjoy the day :) 
Post Op Day 1 : Feeling fine . Pretty soar , but I can move my foot pretty normally now ( not quite so high vertically because they had to go deep into my calf , which is now hurting a bit ) . So far pretty pleased with the results . Besides some pressure , swelling , and a < PROPMALE > of pain , my left leg feels pretty darn good :D 
Post Op Day 4 : Still feeling pretty good ! A little bit more sore and my leg kind of feels on fire . But I am sooooo thankful that I don't have a cast on right now :) . I see the doctor again on Monday for my 1-week post-op visit and will let everyone know how it goes ! Enjoy your weekends :) 
Minor Setback : my leg has gotten all red and swollen . The doctor said he think it's an infection so he gave me antibiotics to be on the safe side , but he really has no idea if it's an allergic reaction or infection . But my gosh , I can move my foot and I am very thankful for that at least ! I'm seeing the doctor again next week to see if the \infection\ " gets any better . I promise to keep everyone updated !! <3 " 
My leg is looking a lot better ! It's significantly less swollen and red and therefore it feels better . It's getting a little better each day but I still have a long ways to go . But I'll take what I can get ! 
AM I WHO I THINK I AM ?!?! This whole zodiac sign changing up shpeal is rather nerve wracking ! Does anyone know what the start year for the application of the \new\ " zodiac signs is ?! " 
I'm starting to lose my limp !!!! I am beyond ecstatic :D :D :D 
had a fantastic day with < PROPFEMALE > Greene . Potbellys and Season of the Witch were a perfect combination :D . And most importantly , I learned that if I ever run into plague-ridden , zombie-demon-possessed monks who have incredible fighting skills , all I need to do is stay calm and focused and simply chop off their heads . Maybe I should start carrying a sword around .... 
SO . MUCH . PACKING . TO . DO !!!! At least when it's all over I know I'm officially heading back to W&M :) 
sadly , due to weather conditions , I can't drive to W&M until Wednesday morning :( . Hopefully I'll arrive before my 11:00 orgo class ... 
AT W&M :D :D :D 
had a great first day of classes !! I'm very happy to be back and it's absolutely wonderful to see everyone :) 
Post-Op Day 17 : Had a horrible mishap last night with my leg - don't want to give too many details because I don't want to freak anyone out . Essentially , I have a seroma ( build up of serum ) , and the pressure built up , so my leg imploded , in a sense , ( technically my wound is hissing ) . I need to go back to the surgeon on Monday and am left not feeling so great :( 
Nothing can cheer you up more than hanging out with friends and visiting the horses in Colonial Williamsburg :) 
HO'10 W&M Aromas date with < PROPFIRST > Cohen , < PROPFEMALE > Tucker , and < PROPFEMALE > Capslock Kong !!! Soooooo excited :D 
will be back at W&M tomorrow ... sadly I need to come back to < PROPFEMALE > though on Sunday ... AGAIN ! :( 
today's summation in one word : UGH !! 
what's worse than having the flu ? having a virus that is EXACTLY like the flu except there is no medicine for it :'( 
is drinking an insane amount of tea ... which made me want to learn more about tea and found out that until the nineteenth century , solid blocks of tea were used as money in Siberia ... i need to get better asap so i can stop wasting my time 
ugh . infection round 2 - prepare to be vanquished !!! 
wishes she could walk outside in the beautiful williamsburg weather :( . unfortunately i am VERY , VERY sick from my leg infection and am on bed-rest and can only get up to walk to the restroom . i'm visiting the health center daily for IV antibiotics . i really hope i don't get worse ( which could happen and would be EXTRAORDINARILY BAD ) and get better soon ... 
is hoping and praying to be back to a normal routine by February 9 . With some luck , maybe even earlier :D . My leg is looking better according to the doctors !!! 
Despite the fact that the Steeler's head coach is a W&M alum , I'm going to be supporting the Packers tonight !! 
is going to start attending classes again come tomorrow !! SOOOOO incredibly happy to be back :) 
is so thankful that she can finally walk around and frolic through the beautiful campus of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > today ! Such a lovely day :) 
so in the past 2 days I've seen 3 people leave the Sadler Center with Georgetown Cupcake boxes . Never realized how much I missed those local runs to downtown Bethesda . How I miss thee senior privileges :( 
Is so incredibly happy to see all of her amazing friends at < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > again :) 
< PROPMALE > firth , will you marry me ? 
when life gets you down , google pictures of pudu . They will overwhelm you with cuteness :) 
Happy Pi Day Everyone ! 
Happy Ides of March Everyone ;) 
I think I really need to see Despicable Me .... 
Wow , I think I need to start wearing a mouth guard while I study - my jaw is killing me after mass amounts of bio studying !! 
has an odd < PROPFEMALE > to read < PROPFEMALE > tonight .... an intense and beautiful thunderstorm tonight is probably the likely origin of this < PROPFEMALE > 
Finds it very peculiar that there is a palm tree next to Ewell Hall ... well , I guess I can officially say < PROPFEMALE > has palm trees ? 
Could REALLY use a trip to Disney World right about now ! 
Two petting zoos in 3 days ?!?! W&M , you are AMAZINGGGGG ! 
finds it very sad that there are Sparknotes for < PROPMALE > Potter :( 
So excited for tomorrow !! < PROPMALE > Nye <3 
:D REGISTRATION = ABSOLUTE SUCCESS :D 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFIRST > Bunsen !! Chemistry would nearly be as fun without you ! 
Ahhh , April 1st . I wish all the luck in the world to Holton's magnificent Class of 2011 . <3 Love you guys <3 
La plus perdue de toutes < PROPMALE > journées est celle où l'on n'a pas ri . ~ Sébastien Roch < PROPMALE >
