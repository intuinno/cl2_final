Tonight was sad . The best team in the whole wide world was defeated by pack of dogs ... cheating ones at that . But tomorrow is Sunday and I can wholly focus on Christ now :) 
And I will , I will be my brother's keeper , not the one who judges him , I won't despise him for his weakness , I won't regard him for his strength , I won't take away his freedom , I will help him learn to stand . I love you Truett !! Tomorrow's an exciting milestone for you :D 
is no longer a member of the cast of Bye Bye < PROPFEMALE > due to prioritizing and scheduling conflicts . :( Thanks anyway guys . I'll try again in the spring . 
no you did not have a home-there were places you visited frequently-took off your shoes & scratched your feet-bc you knew the whole world belonged to the meek so you did not have a home-birds have nests-foxes have dens-but the hope of the whole rested on the shoulders of a homeless man-you had the shoulders of a homeless man-& the world can't stand what it cannot own & they can't own you bc you did not have a home 
My Spanish speaking skills are limited and I'll just have to get used to the fact that Spanish speaking people do not come with subtitles ... but they really should ! 
it's 11:29 at night .. and i can't sleep 
well I made the district's choir and i'll hear the verdict ( hopefully tomorrow ) about state choir later and i must be REALLY tired bc i fell asleep at 8:30 watching tv with the family . even now , my head is wanting to nod off .... ...

Curse these silly and ridiculous habits/addictions !! Argh ! 
Just realized I have nothing much to do in the summer months after I graduate ... great .

* sigh * 
Dear Diary , I walked 3 < PROPMALE > today ! I'm not sure how I feel about that .. Love , < PROPFEMALE > :D

I received so many Happy Birthdays today !! Too many to count :D Was serenaded with the birthday song 4 times , was given 3 bouquets of daisies , laughed SOOO hard , and drank entirely too much orange soda with an outrageous group of girls that I was lucky enough to < PROPFEMALE > with tonight !! My 18th birthday was a very sweet one . Thanks guys ! Thanks God ! 
Okay .... my phone is messed up guys and I can't read your texts ... don't text me ! This is getting ridiculous ! :) But if you want to call me I'll answer .. 
You've got me smiling while I sing , you've got me laughing in my sleep . Haha . 
This will be the first and last time I ever put this in a status :) text it ! lol

I'm ready for a relaxing break ... after I also finish makeup algebra and AP rewrite and studying for a Spanish quiz ... then I'm ready ! 
“'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand when we with daisies lie , that commerce will continue , and trades as briskly fly” - < PROPFEMALE > Dickinson 
Okay guys .. my birthday daisies are now gone . I need some more . Any takers ? :D 
Thanksgiving is almost over and it's about time to get back to work .. I've got an AP paper to re-write , music to practice , and a bed to get back home to .. 
Mom says I need a job . She's probably right . 
I still love my mother's chili .. even when she substitutes the sausage for deer meat ... after all we all have our moments . :D 
Is it wrong to jam out to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s christmas music ? No . I think not . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > was right .. the Rays are on here entirely too early :D 
The more I think the more I wish that we could lay here for hours and just reminisce .. 
A sure cure for seasickness is to sit under a tree . 
\ ... I sure think you're beautiful ... \"" 
Don't mind me .. if I'm not smiling it's for a good reason . 
Finally I figured out , but it took a long , long time . Now there's a turn about .. maybe ' cause I'm trying . 
If there's anybody out there would like to give away an unused itunes card I would not say no to accepting said card . Also . If anyone wants to why I suddenly burst into tears tomorrow .. don't ask . Just let me cry please . :) It's cathartic . 
< PROPFEMALE > told me I'm on the naughty list . I'm not sure why . 
Does anyone know how to apply for the NHS scholarship ? 
So I've got this Christmas concert tonight .. and I'm playing Christmas music at it ... so weird ! ( and the house smells like bread ; it's driving me crazy ! ) 
You are even cooler than the flip side of my pillow . :) 
Someone in the Gallatin area called my cell phone at 9:40 p.m. ... I'm afraid I don't who you are bc you're number wasn't programmed into my phone . Care to call me back ? I'd call you but you might be someone scary ! 
All I need now to complete this crazy circle is a < PROPFEMALE > chain :) 
Is there no place to purchase a turtle in this town ?? 
\What do you mean he don't eat no meat ?!?! \"" 
Had a gleeful time at the Zizzerette Christmas party despite < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Harrington's assurances to the opposite ! :D 
Madrigal Dinners : its really hot in the armory , the < PROPMALE > chair is slightly uncomfortable ( but still cool ) , the play was cheesy but I did laugh , and I had a terribly fantastic time . 
I'm one step away from breaking down 10 minutes late and I'm totally falling down And it's so plain to see I am my own worst enemy One more day and I'll get it right I'm a trip , I'm a mess and I'm crying on the inside That's why it feels so good to say That you're only a prayer away !! Thank you Lord . 
Green is ... 
is going to have a conversation with < PROPMALE > Arnold .. SOME day . Obviously not on Thursday :D 
Really ? REALLY ? 
anyone want to bring me a bag of those Lindor truffles ? the dark chocolate ones ? They're at walmart on the bottom left corner shelf . I will love you forever ! 
Feels slightly ignored by the people tonight . Sad . 
Why are all of my sidebar ads asking me to become a fan of < PROPFEMALE > Palin all of a sudden ? 
I love my family . They really are a wonderful family . The kind you enjoy making a run to the house to find a forgotten c.d. for or the kind you are happy to take to mcdonalds since they missed supper earlier . They're really a nice group of people to live with and I'm so glad that they're mine . 
I get to wear my slipper socks !! Love them ! :D ( btw . Dom Medina ) 
Blah Blah Blah , everything YOU say must be a brown comment and I'm not very creative , who am I ? Dom Medina that's who . 
I'm liking this not having to be anywhere until 4:40 thing ! It's kind of nice :) 
Hark how the bells Sweet silver bells .. 
I love apples !! 
I had a crazy dream last night 
All in all the day has been very satisfactory and now I get to watch my < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > perform at their Christmas concert :) 
la vie en < PROPFEMALE > 
My hair looks fabulous just so you know ! 
5 hours later ... and of the 12 rooms , 1 wood floor and 1 staircase I must clean/polish/vacuum , I have 5 rooms done . I will likely be cleaning until the trumpet sounds . 
I was looking at the 2006 FBC Church directory and came to the realization that the years have done some favors for many awkward young teenangers and preteens . The only person this is not true for is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > who was just as pretty then as she is now ! Seriously girl , it's like you took the picture yesterday ! 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > Gift ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Truett < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Other emembers of the < PROPFIRST > clan may be wondering why I did not get them in this clever ruse to win again . Well only I know why . :) haha . 
It's Christmas < PROPFEMALE > . My very favorite day of the year . I'm praying yours is just as special for you as mine is for me . I love you !! 
Visions of sugarplums everyone !! Purple ones . 
I love being lazy ... 
I got my < PROPFEMALE>'s for christmas .. spent the day being lazy .. took a looong nap .. went to the movies .. and looked at the christmas lights with my truly wonderful family . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody . 
Why do I get friend requests from people in Italy ? 
So now that ALL of my siblings know the words to Fireflies ... 
Tomorrow morning if you wake up and the sun does not appear . I will be here . I will be here , when you feel like being quiet , when you need to speak your mind , I will listen . And I will be here when the laughter turns to cryin ' , through the winning losing and trying , I will be here . I will be here . 
It's a matter of integrity . No woman wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man is dead or not . 
just realized I haven't imported ANY pictures off my camera's memory card since July ! 
When you wish upon a < PROPFEMALE > ... the < PROPFEMALE > stays put and you get to feel kind of silly . 
Just existing isn't living . Simply living isn't true existence . Don't waste your life .. figure out your purpose on this earth and do it . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > I kind of need to < PROPFEMALE > out with you and your camera . Bring people . <3 ya !! 
I am psychosomatically inclined to be crazy :) Happy New Year ! 
Trampled by turtles . 
It's a new year soon . 
Orange Cinnamon Tea = wonderful ! 
I love myself !!!!. 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > .. you ask SO many questions :) 
Impaled is a silly show ... i don't like it a bit !!!! Now < PROPFEMALE > Montana .. THAT'S a real show ! 
Does anyone really believe that we'll have school tomorrow ? 
I <3 you Jack ... Michael ... Jason ... :)

I tickled the < PROPFIRST > keys today . 
Black .. lol 
I . Am . Bored . 
Yeah .. I'm really diggin this Grand < PROPFEMALE > lipstain ;) 
What is on my mind ... hmm : The < PROPFEMALE > Pimpernel ... Colt McCoy ... Kaymon Witt ... Root Beer ... Canary Yellow Camaros ... Predestination ... < PROPFEMALE > ... and NO ! 
If < PROPMALE > has one goat and < PROPFIRST > has nine , how soon will they marry ? 
I had a huge zit this morning .. but it's gone now ... oh yes , I sprayed some windex on it . 
pizza&snogging .. oh yeah and I'm a genius at pool . I could probably beat the zombies at pool . But I could own Dom Medina at guitar hero . And thats how my day went . 
Did you know that I dream about you Waiting for the look in your eyes When we meet for the first time Did you know that I pray about you Praying that you will hold on And keep your loving eyes only for me I'll be yours and you'll be mine I am waiting for Praying for you darling Wait for me too Wait for me as I wait for you Cause , I am waiting for Praying for you darling Wait for me too Wait for me as I wait for you 
He said , I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into .. 
pump up your fists if you twist like this till the lights go out !!! i'm trying to be energetic here people .. :S 
When I made up my mind and my heart along with that to live not for myself but yet for God , somebody said do you know what you are getting yourself into ? I'm getting into YOU .. because I've got to be , You're essential to survive . I'm gonna love You with my life . 
According to UrbanDict . an < PROPFEMALE > is a super sweet girl . Extremely gorgeous and tons of fun . When you meet one you will want to be a huge part of her life but you would be very lucky for it to happen . An < PROPFEMALE > will stay on your mind forever ; that's how you will know when you meet one . 
I am a turtle . My name is < PROPMALE > . I can count by twos and tie my shoes . I eat Fly Cookies . 
Um , yeah I look rather nice in pink feathers ! 
My room . Is . A . Mess ... and surprisingly it isn't < PROPMALE > Roseman's fault this time ! 
Dom Medina should know that < PROPFEMALE > is a virtue . 8:30 .. but if we're feeling nice we might even show up right before that .. 
We played the flute for you and you did not dance .. 
Lovely .. right as I'm finished getting some exercise for once , what do I see ? An advertisement for < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s! Thanks alot Facebook ! 
That's like the 10th person this month to friend request me and I have no idea who they are .. :S 
Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments , because you know they produce quarrels . And the Lord's servant must not quarrel ; instead , he must be kind to everyone , able to teach , not resentful ( 2 < PROPMALE > . 2:23 -24 ) . All of you , live in < PROPFEMALE > with one another ; be sympathetic , love as brothers , be compassionate and humble ( 1 Pet . 3:6 ) . 
\tiptoing through the tulips .. past where you've been lying there asleep .. the dust gathering on your face .. and I realize that in this rain are the tears I've been crying for you all along .. \"" 
The fog oh the fog .. how I'd like to run through you around and around .. but I'm afraid I might not see the ground before me .. though you are beautiful ! 
sitting here in my pj's trying desperately to think of something intelligent to put into tomorrow's in-class writing for AP English .. blah .. that's all I got ! 
Prayers : I want to get an A on todays in-class writing . 
That floating on air feeling after you run .. it's some kind of wonderful .. 
If you love someone let them go .. if you have to stalk them , they probably weren't yours in the first place . - < PROPFEMALE > Bullock . We all start out as stalkers . - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ... 
The fault for the giant green bruise on my leg belongs to < PROPMALE > Faulkner Jones , < PROPFIRST > Hadley , < PROPMALE > Ramirez , one of Mrs. Owens ' desks , and the American flag hanging from her ceiling . 
You should probably check out my bucket list .. 
We should communicate our convictions with humility and from a < PROPFEMALE > to please God , not to put others down . 
Oh < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ... I love you so very much . 
As the rain falls from heaven i'm lost in Your love You're overwhelming Jesus And were walking together holding hands Oh it's just You and me Jesus 
God is weird . Prayer is weird . Faith is weird . Stop & think about it ; Being a born again Christian is a weird thing . I believe that the same power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead flows in me & lives in me . I believe that at any given point in any given day , I can reach out to a holy Lord who set the entire universe in motion & have a conversation . That's weird , but it's also surprisingly easy to forget 
Watching Cake Boss should not stress me out more than filling out scholarships . :P 
Pluziosity 
Wherever You Are Whenever It's Right You'll Come Out Of Nowhere And Into My Life ... I Just Haven't Met You Yet ... 
hmm ... Oprah ? 
I need to get off facebook so that i can do collegeAl , read 2 chs . of the < PROPFEMALE > Pimpernel , do chapter 4 questions for LOTF , practice my flute , journal , and FINALLY watch my movie ! 
I'm too young for this ! 
It was prettier than poetry the first time you said hello to me .. didn't take me long to see that you mean more than anyone ! 
I froze AND had fun ! Tailer Rinker should be on my radio someday ! Audrey < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > needs to paint me a picture even if it isn't my bday . Beth Kittle needs my help with the quest to find the elusive Mr. Jones . Robby < PROPFEMALE > needs to finish teaching me how to whistle . Brock Caldwell could stop tripping innocent passers by if he tried hard enough ! 
1:20 in the AM + < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > + Lord of the Flies + a bunch of dumb questions = well I just don't know what ... but we're finished anyway ! 
Colbie Caillat is a polygamist according to Truett < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Doe .. not sure how I feel about this . 
What do the Philippines , Italy , Russia , Japan , and Australia all have in common ? Creepers live there who want to be my \friend \"" 
My day is so busy , that I had to have a schedule outlining the whole day's \events . \"" 
You are IGNORING me .. and you're being extremely obvious about it . So thanks . 
38 minutes . 46 seconds . That's how long two friends can talk on the phone about almost nothing and still come away from the conversation feeling satisfied . It's not my record , but it'll do . 
< PROPFIRST > Smith is my hero for the day . 
\I am trying Not to tell you But I want to I’m scared of what you’ll say So I’m hiding what I’m feeling But I’m tired of Holding this inside my head ! \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > can beg all she likes but she is NOT getting a < PROPFIRST>'s box from us . however ... 
O'er Ganges now launches the sun god the sun god his splendor ... english translations are never what you expect them to be .. 
I am sufficiently weirded out now . thanks . oh and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . enjoy your childish cartoons 8{D 
Secrets make friends .. .. annoyed . 
I will not be anxious , but as I present my requests to you , flood me with the peace that surpasses all understanding so my heart and my mind are guarded in Christ Jesus ( Philippians 4:6 , 7 ) 
SBU with < PROPFIRST > Smith !! 
I am obviously being ignored .. it would be great if you at least had the decency to find a way to tell me what the deal is ! 
I don't care if you're dead ... time-travelin ' ....... or the ghost of christmas past !!!! 
He wraps Himself in light ... and darkness tries to hide and trembles at His voice .. 
SOMEday .. or not .. So long as I'm carrying myself the right way ! 
I am a faerie in a strange land . In fact I am the record keeper of the faeries . It’s rather nice having a job where you can make boring transcripts at least a joy to look at . 
In His love and in His pity He redeemed them ; And He bore them and carried them all the days of old . But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit ; 
Meet me in St. < PROPFIRST > , Meet me at the fair , Don't tell me the lights are shining any place but there ! 
Whatt did I ever do to you ?? 
is a beautiful girl , has lots of friends , crazy fun , and is always single . ( urban dictionary told me so ! ) 
I would just like to say : I ? being in concert choir . and I'm tired of hearing all about how much better the choir was last year . I don't really care all that much considering I wasn't here and considering this year's choir is still hundreds of < PROPMALE > beyond nearly all high school choirs . So please hush and let me enjoy this . 
I don't want sunbursts or marble halls .. I just want you . 
.. and the BEST part is ... they really feel like they got revenge :D but they have no idea what's next . 
Since You're everything You say You are , could You come close and hold my heart ? I'm on my knees begging You to notice me . Please pray . 
Dancing around the room in squares is .. well you would have had to have been there to know . 
I'm kind of at that point where I'm thinking \hmm .. I've never met half the people on my friends list .. maybe I should delete them\ " and then I don't bc I worry that they'll notice and just add me back again or come and find me with an angry voice of offence . " 
Hello everyone .. how are you ? Btw .. I spell my name with an \E\ " before the \ " Y\ " in case you were wondering . " 
BEAUTIFUL day today !! 
Chapstick . Is . Cool .

I think my friends here in the Plains are finally starting to accept that my hugging them is just part of the deal . This makes me quite joyful . Indeed . 
What do the Beta convention , band room , band bus , choir bus , senior hall , south campus , breakfast table , my bedroom , the yellow < PROPFIRST > , Kaymon's car , a church basement in Kentucky , < PROPMALE > city pool's locker room , a Meramec park cabin , and my porch have in common ? 
Ugh .. my sinuses 
If I could just live in a 3-D world for just one day ..

Be strong and of good courage , do not fear nor be afraid of them ; for the LORD your God , He is the One who goes with you . He will not leave you nor forsake you . Deuteronomy 31:6 Dear Everyman : Make your light shine for Christ with the intensity of a thousand suns ! Maybe it'll be a warm day :) 
Only a few more hours and then we'll be done and then 3.5 more hours and then I'll be hoooooome !

I am so stressed . It's a hate/love relationship I have with district contest .

Today wasn't a fairytale .. my thumbs began to go numb from all the envelopes .. but it was still pretty nice as far as Mondays go . 
Children get your hearts right , He's coming for a PURE bride . What are you doing when noone is watching ? He's coming . 
How did all these people I've never met become my friend ???

I'm friends with everybody in this office . We're all best friends . I love everybody here . But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments , and that is when it's nice to let them know that you could beat them up . 
I.D. badges are long overdue . Security in this office park is a joke . Last year , I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag . I sat at my desk all day , with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch . Can you imagine if I was deranged ? 
I'm bored . 
I do not like ketchup . Btw it used to be spelled \catsup \""

I'd like to say a few words ... about commitment . About honor . About responsibility . About a very special someone and admitting to her in front of everybody that her wedding ... and that very special honeymoon trip to Ep-cot Cent-er ... will have to be postponed . 
If you go to < PROPFEMALE > at Epcot then you have to get an almond baguette . They . Are . Amazing .

A brownie is A little chocolAtey treAt and it is Adorable ! :D 
I'm on fire .. 
What a night of wonder and truth . 
Apparently < PROPMALE > Faulkner Jones is one of my interests ... haha !! 
For what can be known about God is plain to them , because God has shown it to them . For his invisible attributes , namely , his eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly perceived , ever since the creation of the world , in the things that have been made . So they are without excuse . ( Ro . 1:19 &20 ) 
Are you sure about that ? Really sure ? 
QUIET musical hog ! Settle down ! 
Welcome to Wednesday ! 
Goodnight Wednesday , you were a good day . 
Hello ! It's going to be a full day and I'm making brownies to go with it !

Dear Everybody , because international phone plans come at an outrageous price and have ridiculous rules I will not be able to text any of you adorable people until I return -- I have 75 texts but those must be used sparingly for my nearest and dearest ( a.k.a. mom & dad ) .

Why do I get the feeling that sometime my mother uses my facebook account for her < PROPMALE > ways ? hmm .. ;) Fess up Mom ! 
You see my profile pic ? <--- That is what my face looks like without drugs . 
The Truett < PROPFIRST > Band is a silly band . 
Alright , you're gonna miss my face . You just don't know it yet . 
Has anybody just sat still for a moment and listened to < PROPFIRST > Cash speak ? Because if you get the < PROPMALE > , it's worth it . 
Should I write a blog ??

It's true . I just uploaded another video that you're about to go watch . Right now . This means you < PROPMALE > Faulkner Jones/ < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
\So this morning I read the first 7 chapters of Romans .. I just didn't feel like stopping . \ " -Truett --- don't I have the coolest brother ever ? " 
Just looking back and I am filled with joy all over again that I no longer have to wear braces .

There are so many things wrong with this wall right now . 
Dreams are certainly strange things aren't they ? 
First I packed my room up ( while my mother cried ) , then I finished some laundry ( while my mother cried ) , then I cleaned out my drawers/closet ( while my mother cried ) , then I ate a blizzard ( with my youngest November sibling ) , then I went to the park to < PROPFEMALE > out with all of my tiny/taller/ginger friends , and then I ate some guacamole made by my mother who makes the very best guacamole in the entire earth . Beat that ! 
I put a hermit crab on my tongue . THAT wasn't a good idea ! - < PROPFEMALE > 
< PROPMALE > : Hey can I go to the wedding ? Jane : No , < PROPMALE > , you're a boy ! 
Yep .. I'm gonna miss the Jones kids . 
Who knows what today has in store for me ? Doesn't matter though since yesterday was in a word : wondrous ! 
I can put 8 marshmallows in my mouth at once . 
If you come over right now I may or may not be inclined to throw chili powder up your nose . 
As we pull out of West Plains with the sun setting and the goodbyes of best friends following me out , I want to panic and shout , \Wait ! Where did my summer go ? \"" 
Daddy , can we get a shitzu poodle ? 
\What !? I could NOT woo a French man ! \ " -Truett " 
Day one of welcome week , over and done with ! 
Green is good . Red is stop . Remember that forever . 
I love my dorm room . It is my very favorite part of college right now . 
I can stand up straight , under my loft bed . 
Fear of the unknown equals butterflies . 
My heart , is too , kind ! It's full of all sorts of < PROPFEMALE > light . . . aaand . . . coffee cake . 
I am now a pro at cutting down brush ! I also now sport three very adorable scratches on my leg ! 
SBU , characters welcome . 
Going to worship God with the SBU freshmen this morning ! 
Time for class and I'm probably already running late ... 
So there isn't choir today :( 
misses the GGG , the Jones kids , and mi familia quite a bit already . 
I've got a to-do list that just won't stop growing . 
< PROPMALE > supplies are pricy . 
Me : Yeah ! You think I'm cool ! :D Lauren : Actually I do . I think knowing you raised my cool level . 20 points . Me : I don't appreciate your sarcasm . Lauren : I do ... 
Sad Moment of the Day --- Ignoramus in choir : Um , sir ? Are we going to sing that hard piece from last semester ? The one about water or night or something ? Director : Do you mean Water Night ? By Whitacre ? Ignoramus : Oh yeah ! That one ! * giggle* -- :( 
You know that fool mentioned so many times in the Proverbs ? Well that's me in case you were wondering . 
Today I am older and so I will be better . 
Sparknotes told me that I will die Sunday , June 15th 2064 at the tender age of 72 years old , I am a guru ( Submissive Extroverted Abstract Feeler ) , I am 16% in love , 69% dateable , AND that I am a woman . So now I know everything I needed to know about myself . How refreshing . 
Who gets tired at 10:30 at night ? Me . Who gets tired before that ? < PROPFIRST > . We are old ladies . 
As the rain falls from Heaven I'm lost in Your love . You're overwhelming , Jesus ! 
Il me parle tout bas , Je vois la vie en < PROPFEMALE >

Kettle corn .. with < PROPFIRST > . Yeah , yeah baby :) 
Committed Christian teens share four traits : They have a personal story about God they can share , a deep connection to a faith community , a sense of purpose and a sense of hope about their future . 
Dear rain , I love you . I love you very much . But you made lakes everywhere I had to walk today and my toes now resemble raisins . It's gross . Please don't do that ever again . Thank you . Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ahh ! Sharpie < PROPMALE > !! 
\Anything that costs your integrity is too expensive . You can't afford it . \"" 
< PROPMALE > Gregson < PROPMALE > = Genius 
If every path is true and leads to God , then there is no falsehood . Isn't that nice ? BUT if there is no falsehood , then there is no truth because for there to be truth there must be falsehood . The two co-exist . Ergo , we have truth and I believe it is absolute . 
About to see Inception with Brother and my ( uber tall ) cousin ! Excited ! 
Loving being with the family :) 
I am gangsta as a pocket watch . 
Hello Fall , I missed you :) 
Going to worship God in NW Arkansas today and then I'm coming home to YOU ! 
Jane : Do you just not live at my house anymore ? Me : Nope ! J : Why not ? Me : Because I got too old to live at home all the time , and someday you will to and you'll have to go to college . Jane : But what will Mom and Dad do ??? Me : ...... they'll have a party .. every day . Jane : uh , that's weird . 
is enjoying the delightful company of < PROPMALE > Faulkner Jones , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Jones , < PROPMALE > Jones , < PROPFEMALE > Harrington , Christian Reavis , and < PROPMALE > Ball . 
True love never dies . 
Home to SBU :) 
If it's on a toothpick , it's not fattening ! 
Then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with shouts of joy , and they said among the nations , \The Lord has done great things for them ! \ " Psalm 126:2 "

Woke up this morning to discover the small ache on the left side of my face from yesterday has turned into swelling . :( Why me ??? 
There's only one of me and I don't stretch much farther than right below my toes .. 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Mitchell ... bahahahaha !!! 
I'm SO cold . My toes are quite wet and quite frozen . 
\Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass - it's about learning to dance in the rain . \ " .. whoever said this obviously had rain boots . " 
I liked < PROPFIRST > Mraz before Truett < PROPFIRST > did and Kaymon Witt stole my shirt ;) ... 
Lead me with strong hands . Stand up when I can't . Don't leave me hungry for love , chasing dreams . Show me you're willing to fight ; that I'm still the love of your life . I know we call this our home but I still feel alone . So Father , give me the strength to be everything I'm called to be . Oh , Father , show me the way to lead them . Won't You lead me ? 
Almost freaked out bc the clock read 7:48 am and I thought for about two seconds that I needed to book it for an 8am class .. that I don't have on Fridays . 
Paint me with Your purity . 
I would like some steak fries with horseradish sauce . 
If you're a bird , I'm a bird . 
Life isn't a dress rehearsal . 
I've had a fabulously beautiful day because good people plus picnicking plus no rain equals fabulous and beautiful . 
Jane : i love you ! I love you all the way to sixteen hundred and forty six ! -- and then she told me a word she learned in Latin . She's going to be so much greater than me . 
Cable has TCM which means I can now watch Silent Sundays ! 
God is not dead . He's surely alive and He's living on the inside ROARING like a lion . 
Here's to hallways that smell like cookies and artwork that's carved out of credit cards . 
God is never partly anything . Tozer

Earrings are like sneezes : 2 are okay but 10 in a row is just annoying . 
My suite mate ( one < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tipton ) woke me up with her techno dance craze music this morning .. :D obviously we were meant to be suite mates .

I know what you're up to ! And don't think that I'm not laughing about it ! 
CSLewis : If they are wrong they need your prayers all the more & if they are your enemies , you are under orders to pray for them 
I'll admit it .. I do like Family Force 5 . 
My mind is dwelling on the fact that I should be asleep right now and that I finally threw away that number !

Loved having lunch with Dad today ! :) can't wait to see everyone else this weekend ! 
It's fall .. that means it's time to get pumpkins/mums for the porch and go to bonfire parties and hayrides with your friends and maybe just maybe pretend like you know how to square dance for about 5 minutes ! But here I am .. sitting in my dorm room .. doing none of that .

And tomorrow my mom is making me some very special toast :) It's been a pretty good weekend . " 
So ... yeah ... I'm geared up .

Don't hug a tree , hug me ! 
I had a dream that my < PROPMALE > was dropped in Lake Billabong while < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > was chasing me in a scuba suit . I dropped it while flying over Lake Billabong on a zip line . Truett ( also in a scuba suit ) immediately jumped in to save it but it was too late ... 
Mmm , strawberry syrup with pancakes , eggs over easy , ghirardelli brownies , < PROPFIRST > sinatra , and good people :) 
Why am I so pumped up at 1:30 in the morning ( while fully aware that I have to up rather early in a few hours) ? Because it has been an astoundingly wonderful evening . 
< PROPFIRST > and I have a futon that works ! 
Over the mountains and the sea ... 
half of my heart's got a grip on the situation . 
No matter what < PROPFEMALE > may have told you , I am NOT having a baby ! 
About to write some lyrics about < PROPMALE > Jones ' moustache 
KFC/Rib Crib combo ??? Weirdos . 
Wait ... Denmark isn't a state ? :D 
Hey ! I'm the Rays and I'm getting ready to be your best friend ! Wanna be my brother ? 
Hey < PROPFEMALE > ! Look ! Those people left money at that table . Here you go ! - < PROPFEMALE > ( we did make her put it back ) 
It's a gorgeous day outside and the park was splendid ! 
Father , I know you're trying to tell me something . Please help me to hear ! I want to understand ! Thank you for the wonderful day and thank you for < PROPFEMALE > Busby < PROPFEMALE > Sivcovich and Jerin Meyer 
Love , it seems like only yesterday , you were just a child at play . Now you're all grown up . Oh how fast those moments flee . Once we watched a lazy world go by , now the days seem to fly . Life is brief , but when it's gone , love goes on and on . 
You're waiting for a train , a train that will take you far away . You know where you hope this train will take you , but you can't be sure . But it doesn't matter - because we'll be together . 
All the world seems in tune , on a spring afternoon when we're poisoning pigeons in the park . Ev'ry Sunday you'll see my sweetheart and me , as we poison the pigeons in the park . 
Stairway To Heaven on the harp ? I think yes . 
Is anyone from SBU going to West Plains this weekend and coming home anytime on Sunday afternoon ? Because I need a ride home :D Let me know ! 
I am thankful for sweet friends who make me ice cream cake . 
We must get over wanting to be needed-this is the hardest of all temptations to resist - C.S. < PROPFIRST > 
I have the very best brother in the world ! 
7 more days !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > made laugh so hard , the carrot pieces I was eating shot up into my nose and I had to blow them out . Chunky orange snot anyone ? 
laughing all over because I realize that I've won this battle of childishness . 
Guess what ? I got to dress up as a < PROPFEMALE > tonight and so did a couple of my friends . We looked wonderful . That's all I wanted to tell you ! 
How happy is the man who does not follow the advice of the wicked , or take the path of sinners , or join a group of mockers ! Instead , his delight is in the LORD's instruction , and he meditates on it day and night . He is like a tree planted beside streams of water that bears its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither . Whatever he does prospers . Psalm 1:1 -3 
4 more days ! 
This nonsense took a turn for the ridiculous about 20 minutes ago . 
LORD , I seek refuge in You ; let me never be disgraced . Save me by Your righteousness . Listen closely to me ; rescue me quickly . Be a rock of refuge for me , a mountain fortress to save me . For You are my rock and my fortress ; You lead and guide me because of Your name . You will free me from the net that is secretly set for me , for You are my refuge . Psalm 31:1 -4 
In the wee small hours of the morning , that's the time I miss you most of all . 
God , hear my cry ; pay attention to my prayer . I call to You from the ends of the earth when my heart is without strength . Lead me to a rock that is high above me , for You have been a refuge for me , a strong tower in the face of the enemy . I will live in Your tent forever and take refuge under the shelter of Your wings . Psalm 61:1 -4 
I would make a great hobo . -Jerin 
Moonlight and love songs , never out of date . Hearts full of passion , jealousy , and hate . Woman needs man and man must have his mate . That , no one , can deny . It's still the same old story , a fight for love and < PROPFEMALE > , a case of do or die . The world will always welcome lovers , as time goes by . 
The glands in my throat are swollen . My head is feeling light and there's way too much stuff up in there causing a rather unfortunate headache . Why me ? 
Watch yo'self! I am a highly skilled NERF assassin and like my mother before me , I have eyes in the back of my head ! 
Dreams are strange things . In dreams , < PROPFIRST > becomes a 70 year old woman with a thing for strawberries and is having an affair with another man and I start dating a wealthy Indian business mogul who won't take me to see Phantom of the Opera unless I tell him the story first . Oh , and I'm always taller in my dreams ... 
I'm in West Plains . I certainly do like it here . :) 
For my birthday I have already had a piece of one very delicious homemade cake , a declaration of love , and a < PROPFEMALE > trying to wake me up early !

Can't wait to see Pride & Prejudice with my friends Jerin Meyer , < PROPFIRST > Offord , < PROPFEMALE > Sivcovich and < PROPFIRST > Layer ! My good friend < PROPFEMALE > Busby is playing < PROPFIRST > ! God has blessed me with so many great people in my life ! 
Pride & Prejudice ... that story just makes me giddy ! 
I saw Mr. < PROPFEMALE > a moment ago . :) 
It's an < PROPMALE > kind of day . 
Broccoli & Cheese soup , Hercules , home made chocolate chip raisin cookies , and < PROPFEMALE > Busby = a very enjoyable evening . Now I'm gonna go pray for a friend :) 
Today I am going to be a painter . 
Listening to JJ Heller live in my chapel service ! 
JJ Heller plays her own harmonica . \Woo ! \"" 
I am not a theologian or a scholar , but I am very aware of the fact that pain is necessary to all of us . In my own life , I think I can honestly say that out of the deepest pain has come the strongest conviction of the presence of God and the love of God . - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Trust in the Lord with all of your heart and < PROPFEMALE > not on your own understanding . In all of your ways , acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths . Proverbs 3:5

Here is the deepest secret nobody knows . Here is the root of the root and the < PROPMALE > of the < PROPMALE > . And the sky of the sky of a tree called life ; which grows higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide . And this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

< PROPFEMALE > and I just sang through the 12 days of Christmas :D

Daddy sang bass , Momma sang tenor , me and little brother would join right in .. 
What I mean to say is , you can eat crackers in my bed , Baby , anytime . :D bahaha !! 
HAPPY THANKSGIVING !!! HUGS TO EVERYONE ! 
Snow on Thanksgiving = wonderful . Everything else is just going to be a bonus ! 
You know you're bored when you start filling out those stupid question and answer things on Facebook ... twice . 
True love isn't just expressed in passionately whispered words or an intimate kiss or an embrace ; before two people are married , love is expressed in self-control , < PROPFEMALE > , even words left unsaid . - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE >

I wish I was as awesome as < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
Party ! 
I will whip my hair back and forth in the cafeteria if I want to ! 
I need to stop sleeping through my alarm even if it's the last week of classes . :( 
If you are kind only to your friends , how are you different from anyone else ? 
I just threw up .. on my plate .. in Mellers .

I believe that when weather.com says : 25°F feels Like : 14° with wind from ESE at 11mph , that's code for DON'T GO OUTSIDE . Of course that's 10° better than last night when it was 4° as I walked back from work !
