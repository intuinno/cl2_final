I wish he knew how I felt about him ... He probably has no idea . I don't know him that well . He wouldn't ever guess that I wish we were together . I don't even know what to do , I haven't felt this way in so long . But if he knew , would he run away ? I wish I could tell you ... I really do .... Well I talked to you today at least ... Something I rarely have the courage to do ... Damn it , why is it so hard to want someone . :(

I STILL like him , and he has NO IDEA that I exist . He didn't talk to me at ALL today . I just don't know what to talk to him about . Saying I'm awkward is the understatement of the century . 
At Girl Scouts , we have this thing called a friendship circle . You close your eyes and make a wish , then squeeze the hand of the person next to you . Eventually , it comes back to the person who started it . Since < PROPFEMALE > thinks I have a < PROPMALE > , I wished for him . <3

GLEE CLUB MEETING TOMORROW AT 7:05 :D :D :D :D :D <-- This means I have to drag my ass out of bed even earlier than I deem acceptable on weekdays . There's a drawback to almost everything . Eating this fantastic vanilla yogurt ice cream thing I just found in the freezer . Don't really know what it is , does it really matter ? 
Uneventful day . Sometimes those are good .

I totaled my car in Woonsocket today on the way to the NHS open house . Having never been in an accident before , I was terrified .

What a horrible day . I feel like every time I try to help somebody or do something good it just backfires on me . I sincerely need reassurance that I'm not an idiot , because it really hurts being told that by someone I look up to ... This hasn't happened in a long time , but I can truly say that I've been crushed . 
Got into Brandeis ! Who'd have thought ? O.o
