i dropped my laptop AGAIN ...

... it's one thing for me to say \I miss A1-7/Taiwan/Dongyin/AID/ ... \ " another for me to hear my mom say that when I got back from Taiwan she actually felt that I was \ " emotionally low\ " with a feeling of having \ " fallen in love\ " ... she even related me to a scene in a really old Chinese movie ... i feel so strange after hearing that ... " 
kids who sing songs whose meaning they have no idea about at the top of their lungs ? ignorant idiots ( me sometimes included XP ) . \

attempting to pack my stuff away ... gets pretty depressing when you look around only to realize that your home looks pretty much the same ... but then again i'm leaving about 90% of my stuff here ( 89% of that being mess with 9% of what i'm taking with me being clothes ) ... so i guess until all of that's cleaned out , home will still be home :] . \

my new address for the next year :\ 
< PROPFEMALE > Tarng\ 
2650 Durant Ave\ 
FR-812\ 
Berkeley , CA 94720 
My new roommates remind me of my old roommates :\\\ 
Kat and < PROPFIRST > both like tennis and < PROPFIRST > is still taller than me ( though not by as much ;P )\ 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > both eat a lot more than me XD 
Why does everyone tease me on my height these days ? I'm NOT short . I have a perfectly average asian height . >:P 
what do i get for slacking off the first few days of school ?... 2 weeks of hell and headaches . 
if i collected all the pennies i've seen on the crosswalks up until now in Berkeley ... i'd probably have a dollar . \ 
... then there were the ring of keys , the < PROPMALE > ticket , the CalID , and the credit card ... it's amazing what u can find at Berkeley ... should u just look at the ground :P 
=.= even on the 8th floor we can hear the people partying loud n clear ... i want my sleep ~~~ which is y i've gotten into the habit of listening to my mp3 at night ... i'll probably choke myself one day 
... why is it that coming to berkeley i'm suddenly seeing a whole bunch of people who look like a bunch of other people ? \ 
i saw a girl who looks like my counselor < PROPFEMALE > emmert\ 
i saw a guy who looks looks like detective callahan from rookie blue\ 
and i saw another guy who looks like the boyfriend of my roommate\ 
... such a strange world Cal is ... 
These last two weeks I feel like I spend most of my time reading ... my head hurts XP 
I'm so lucky I can go back home whenever I want ... I've probably made over 5 ( LONG ) lists so far for things that I found out I need or that would be really helpful to have ... 
yay ~ i can poke people faster now XD 
i wish time would just stop and give me a day to collect myself and catch up to everything before it continued to tick away the seconds ... too bad reality is a b*tch . 
... shouldn't have sworn ... it's not reality's fault it doesn't work that way ... \ 
( ... going into repenting mode >_<) 
so stupid -_- ... my bank interest so low that it doesn't even cover the stupid 50 cent fee berkeley charges me every time i pay my monthly < PROPMALE >
