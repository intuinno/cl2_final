The LORD is my light and my salvation ;\ 
Whom shall I fear ? \ 
The LORD is the strength of my life ; \ 
Of whom shall I be afraid ? \ 
When the wicked came against me\ 
To eat up my flesh , \ 
My enemies and foes , \ 
They stumbled and fell . \ 
Though an army may encamp against me , \ 
My heart shall not fear ; \ 
Though war may rise against me , \ 
In this I will be confident . Psalm 27:1 -3

Today is a terrific day for you , Sagittarius , in which action spells reward . You can't go wrong by expressing your needs and how they fit with the collective agenda . Feel free to focus on you and be selfish about your passions . Be aware that unexpected events may crop up to remind you that number one is indeed important , but don't forget about < PROPFIRST > two , three , and so on . 
“A relationship is like a < PROPFEMALE > , How long it lasts , no one knows . Love can erase an awful past , love can be yours , you'll see at last . To feel that love , it makes you sigh , To have it leave , you'd rather die . You hope you've found that special < PROPFEMALE > , ' cause you love and care for the one you chose . ” 
“The < PROPMALE > of being yourself at your best is the < PROPMALE > of unfolding your personality into the person you want to be . . . . Be gentle with yourself , learn to love yourself , to forgive yourself , for only as we have the right attitude toward ourselves can we have the right attitude toward others . ” 
I search for words to tell you\ 
How much you mean to me \ 
To let you know how precious \ 
Each day has come to be\ 
To show how much I value\ 
The little things you do\ 
Can really be expressed , dear\ 
Just saying .... \ 
? I Love You . ? 
Sinking in quicksand ? Lie on your back .

My Sagittarius Horoscope for today ... You like to give people advice and help them find direction in their lives - sometimes when they haven't even asked . But now it's your turn to feel a little lost . You may need to get away from it all to get some perspective on your life . What about taking a trip to some faraway land ? Today is a good day to make your vacation plans .
