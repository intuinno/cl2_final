\Is God willing to prevent evil 
WHY CAN'T I JUST LIVE IN MONETT !?!?!?!? \

\I’ma shake you off though\ 
a week of being smoke-free . and two days of crazy nights . 
Requiem for a slumber , Requiem for a sleep\ 
\ 
Requiem for my own sake as I rise up from the deep . \ 
Hear the broken toll < PROPFEMALE > , whistle for a cab , \ 
pray for the day to come to meet the reapers wrath . \ 
Bound in blood and shed on stone , the way we move takes me alone . \ 
A simple scar , a simple wish , a simple kiss to fix this 
i have a working phone again . :D 
\why are you such a whore ? \ " \ 
tonight is gonna be insane . hopefully i won't do anything stupid . 
okay , so i almost went to jail last night ... luckily i like being sober , and so we slid out of there all pro-like . 
it's easy to fall in love with a picture . wherein the body lies the trouble . 
pro-life people should die . 
the irony is having no lighter . 
< PROPFIRST > and the giant peach . 
1 ) got a job . ( hopefully , i go in on friday . )\ 
2 ) talked to some very important/awesome people today . \ 
3 ) going to bed . 
trying to burn time until i get to go to work . so far , i haven't burned much . and it's becoming increasingly frustrating . :/

MOVING INTO THE APARTMENT TONIGHT . LOVE YOU < PROPFIRST > AND < PROPFEMALE > , YOU GUYS RULE . 
a beautiful body is one thing , but a beautiful mind is better . 
there's a delay in the apartment ... unfortunately i don't know for how long or if the deal is even going to be followed through . so thanks to the respective parties for nothing . 
today , I killed a dragon . tomorrow , I get drunk . 
well , these past few days have been rather entertaining . and tasking . but now ... i have nothing to do . 
my new cell phone number : 14174898997 
the past two days have givin me peace , for mind and soul . I feel uplifted and ready to get my house . 
When the dust settles and there before you stands the fruits of you labor , regardless of it's functionality or looks , someone should be there to say , \good job 
i will literally pick this world up , and drop it on your motherfucking head . 
if you could condense her whole life story , it'd be the saddest story ever told . 
i like seeing those two rows of < PROPFEMALE > whites . 
lights out , wake up , stay calm , decide . Reach out , stand up , don't be an eye sore . 
cassius it's over , cassius away , cassius these day dreams , these day dreams are gay . \ 
:D that . 
needs a gf 
is passing people on the highway . :) 
people need to quit forgetting to sign out when they log on . like talkin to a wall . 
they were told to smile and say nice things . inside bitterness and hatred grew , and from it came a massacre . \ 
[ Don't fuck with people , they go crazy . ] 
time to go see my best friends child be born . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > is sooo cute : ) i'm proud of < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . they've started what most people long for , a family . 
thank god i'm still a gemini !!!! :] \ 
Let me know if anyone fell into the new horoscope it's pretty interesting . 
getting a ferret next week if i can get approval from my apartment manager , namin ' the little guy < PROPMALE > when i get him . :D
