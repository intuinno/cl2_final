< PROPFIRST>'s graduation was today ; I cried like a baby . I never cry ! What a weenie ! T-bird , how abaut you ? 

< PROPMALE > , if your'e looking , I've never poked anybody before . Hope it didn't hurt ! Miss Manners misses Mr. President . 
added sh#* to my profile . now i'm Interesting ! Woo-hoo ... 
T-storms last night . Dumb dog woke me up with his shaking and panting . He tried to crawl under the nightstand and knocked it over . Long sleepy day ahead on the bkmb . 
Was just out on the back deck playing with < PROPFIRST>'s graduation gift . Shooting at a twig in the pond . Missed the stick , then shot the hell out of a tree ( then I hugged it . ) Not as good as I was , but I've still got it . I love living out in redneck coountry ! 
< PROPFIRST > hit the twig ! Twice ! The boy rocks ! 
Time to VENT !! OK cynic , wet blanket , nay-sayer . Shut your pie hole already and stop raining on my damn parade ! Do you really think you're smarter than the rest of us because YOU KNOW all about what's rotten in the world ? Superior ? Not so much , you fool . We know whats rotten , but some of us don't WALLOW in it ; we deal with it and then dwell on better things .... 
... How can you LIVE in that darkness ? If you were depressed , I'd understand , but you're just negative . Bad Sh#* is out there , like a skunk in the neighborhood . If you use your head , you try to avoid it . You don't walk up to it and pet it , and only an idiot-with-nothing-better-to-do goes out to hunt it with a grenade launcher ... 
... Occasional close encounters are inevitable , and your life will suck until you get the smell out of your hair . You DO NOT invite it into your life !!! It doesn't get to sleep on you bed , shed on your sofa , and crap on your carpet . You don't feed it the food you bought to nourish your loved ones ... 
... Why do you waste your time and energy rolling in stinky stuff like a dog ? Bad sh#* sucks up your emotional resources and stomps all over what you love . IF YOU LET IT !! Maybe you could learn a thing or two from us silly optimists . We're happy because we're smart , not naive . Nyah Nyah Nyah ! I feel better now . 
Ahhh ... the weekend ! 
OMG ! the state of Indiana was the first government in the WORLD to pass a eugenics sterilization law !!! Didn't do much good , or ( really scary thought ) MAYBE IT DID ! 
internet went out Sat . PM . Still out ... how does the most reliable electric co i've ever had , provide such unreliable hi-speed ? couldn't wait to get to worK !! 
TGIF ! 
Years ago , I learned , quite by accident , to stay away from people who assumed it was OK to treat me badly , and I have often wondered if keeping myself so sheltered was wise . I think it is . 
Obvious observation : I-pod - no filler music between GREAT SONGS ! Just can't get over how cool that is !! 
So I'm not subtle . No big deal . 
Hah ! Just visited the < PROPFEMALE > of one < PROPFEMALE > Crandall , one of my favorite authors - She went to Harper College , where my dad taught and I spent my freshman year ! One of the better things to come from Indaina ! 
Just checked the forecast . Three perfect days in a row ? Where am I ??? 
Uh-oh . I started writing this morning , because I knew exactly how I wanted a scene to play out . I DON'T WANT TO STOP !!! 
Lovin ' the writing ! Gotta research K-9 commands . Hmmm , which language ? 
I think I just finished most of a chapter . I like it . Can I please quit my job ? This is way more fun ! 
I sure miss \The Unusuals . \ " That was the best show on TV in a long time ; cancelling it was a big mistake ! " 
There's a stray kitten squalling outside my door . He won't come near us , but I hope he ate the food I put out . He does have a nice safe shelter under a rotten fallen tree trunk by the pond . Still ... 
Spent 1/2 hour yesterday sitting at the edge of the woods ; stray < PROPFEMALE > came within 2 feet of me ! Now I have about a dozed no-see-em bites ... how do those little suckers get inside my underwear ????? Benadryl is my friend . 
< PROPFIRST > Trevino Mathes every single one of you is on my friend list as the result of a conscious decision . I wanted you there . I am not only glad to count you as friends , but some also as family !! Let's see who in my friends list actually pays attention . Copy and paste this in your status . I will be ... watching to see who really does .. You are very special to me . 
I think I'm going to Conner Prairie tomorrow night to see < PROPFEMALE > Carlyle with the ISO ; bet her songs would be great with an orchestra . I have to work all day and < PROPMALE>'s not interested , but that's OK . Solo's cool - used to do it all the time . So a few strangers think I'm odd . Little do they know .... 
Goodness is everywhere . Find it , celebrate it , but wear your Kevlar undies ! 
Puppy Rescue Mission photo : This is what it's all about . Not just the mission , the love . Please share the picture below with everyone !!! 
7 weeks + 1 day , but who's counting .... 
Rocket Bubba is with his new family ! A hero gets a happy ending - it's a good day ! 
< PROPMALE > Knockel : Gays and lesbians don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They want what we all want - to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . But will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Respect all of God's children . \ 
\ 
Well said , < PROPMALE > ! 
More cops killed ! WHY ??? 
Stray kitten was adopted yesterday !!! YAY !!!!!! He turned out to be such a sweetie , I'm glad he got a good home !

Mom and Dad came through on the way from New York to Minnesota . Took us to dinner at Los Martinas . Excellent Mexican food right here in Hooterville ! Great to see them again before < PROPFIRST > leaves .

I get to be a zombie at work today ! 
Election tomorrow !!! NO MORE \PHONE SURVEYS ! \"" 
... can't bring herself th watch the news . Is < PROPMALE > Murdoch now our de facto president ? Do we still have a constitution ? 
Another letter from < PROPFIRST > . He's been sick and he misses home , but he seems to be keeping his feet on the yellow footprints , and his head on straight . Proud mom with little < PROPFEMALE > fissures in my heart , not breakage ... Balance , right ? 
I now have a blog . Is that really cool , really lame , or really inconsequential ? 
\top ten friends who mostly tag you\ " is a virus ! don't open it ! " 
North Putnam HS lost the STATE CHAMPIONSHIP game at < PROPMALE > Oil Stadium . First loss of the season , but NOT a sad event ! We're all so proud of how hard these boys worked and how far they went ; I hope they know they should CELEBRATE their accomplishments ! ( safely please )

BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE DISRESPECTING GAVE HIS OR HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY !
