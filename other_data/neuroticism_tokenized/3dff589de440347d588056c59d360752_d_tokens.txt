Attention facebook , I still feel a wee bit drunk . Also , I survived Y2K , Bird Flu , Swine Flu , Mad Cow , 9/11 , 2 Wars , 8 Years of Bush , and the majority of my teen years . 2012 BETTER BE READY TO RAIN DOWN SOME PAIN ! 

Turning off Pirate ( English ) because it just makes my brain hurt to much .... oh well ... now time for damage control profile update , those happen more often than Menclave updates :D 
Fuck today . Way to much bullshit . 
FAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxx Waiting at school is borring . But I do approve of their laptops . :D Now if Newegg would just be half decent today it might end of a good note . 
is waaaaayyyyyyy bored . And could also use new music . Side Note : With all the web copying each other , I think Facebook should copy Craigs List and have a personals section . 100% Serious on this . 
Pandora can be hard to use sometimes . They just need an import collection button , where I can load a list of my library , artists atleast , then then it randomizes those selections and tries to play similar artists , but not just one style , it'll randomly select a new artist each time that is similar to a artist in my collection . 
Jesus , does anyone post on /b/ that's female STL , makes might night boring . FYI It's a night of trolling :D And possibly lulz , inspired by boredom and free time . Need less of both . 
I could just spam this shit all day 
Just did an app clearing house I forgot how many shitty apps were on here BORING YOU !!!!!!!! IS EASY WHEN I RAMBLE !!!!!!!! 
Epic tits and scary vaguu on /b/ 
Have I ever told folks about my illegitimate brother < PROPFIRST > \Top\ " < PROPMALE >?"

The Shit , it's over for tonight . Still need to teach dem folks about kitchen + pie . 
I keep trollin trollin trollin . _________________ --- Did I ever tell you that : Loving you , is easy with rufees ? 
Still bored as shit . I lied to you all some time ago . But now it's all over , my thoughts continue to roll down a hill like a fat kid after gummy bears . 
Attention Facebook : Penis . That is all . 
IS FUCKING GRUMPY 
Phone's dead from like 3 drops of milk splashing on it . I guess I'm off to sprint tomorrow .... le`fucking-sigh . 
End of a sickening day . It shows the world just how gullible people really are . 
Zombie kill of the day is always gonna be the Double Tap , need to stick to the classics , don't get to complicated fagots , otherwise they'll bite your balls off . 
/yawn/ It's late , and I'm bored . So Facebook here I come . Though I feel such things are disgraceful . But a certain SoJexs knows things that the rest of you do not know , and it is recent news . Feel Jealous . 
All who wish , should send me their phone < PROPFIRST > , as my contacts got ballsacked when I got a new phone . So I need most of you kids protitote lines . 
How hard is it to understand when I say \Don't sink the boart you used to keep afloat\ " to NOT SINK THE FUCKING BOAT ! "

It's also Caturday mattey's! Enjoy your time with the feline friends !

You're in a place for fear , lips are for biting here , lets make this moment worth our while and kill the night while going down in style . Till the magic eye , sees our desimise . Persperation & Alcohol as I introduce the bedroom brawl 
I'm gonna look for a place where I can stay the way I am , lit by the < PROPFEMALE > I set off running . 
This meeting is the future , a thousand hopes . The sky and the truth are far awayThe exit to the labyrinth still unseen . Searching on for the true answer Beyond the darkness , I see a light of miracleZigzagging through it , as the miracle of hope spins 
Words of the day : Get your panties out of a bunch and grow some fucking testicals men ! Jesus Christ ! 
Updating my facebook to reflect curret situations and new features :D I could almost become addicted to this place if you people were more interesting . And yes , I mean YOU PEOPLE ! 
TOUMA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Quote of the day : \Reject common sense and make the impossible possible ! \ " Everyone just needs to be a bit more GAR ! It's just how these things work . " 
RAW RAW ! FIGHT THE POWER ! Do the Impossible , See the invisible , touch the untouchable , break the unbreakable !

In a lack of a better way of sounding like what I despise . The day was a total flop , and I've probably messed up big time on two fronts ..... It's just a breaking point at this time . Not because I'm overloaded , it's the influx of contradicting emotions . I'll probably figure it out though . hopefully . 
Man my profile always pics odd folks to show as friends . 
just did Yoga .... what is wrong with me . 
Note of the day : Why does my life revolve around limits . Twitter & Texting , character limits are so annoying . 
Oh fuck why am I still up . For that matter , why did I come to facebook to ask this question ? This is a sign of something bad . And myself getting some sleep . 
FACEBOOK TRICK : Press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then left and magic circles will appear . The only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! Put this as your status if it works

Why the fuck have I been up since 5:30 ... oh that's right . Tits ... Dear FML.com, most of you are unaware of what it is to be really fucked until you have your sleep ( at what little it ever is ) controlled by a pair of bouncing delicious jello sacks .

When I've got that taste in my mouth , and my gut agree's , while my heart weeps and my mind worries , what should I do ? A . ) Ignore it B . ) Do something about it or C . ) Pussyfoot around the problem till it's your time to strike you dumbass , as planning and waiting is the best strategy ? 
I wish I could tell you something you didn't know .... I wish I could give you something you didn't own ... I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile ... Just want to be that someone you weren't lookin for ... Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door ... And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile ... And I could be with you awhile ...

Back in my country , you called yourself a gun . If you're a gun , then I'm a bullet . A bullet's just a lump of lead , but ... once the hammer hits it , that lump of lead gains the power to blow anything away . If we ... had never met , then I would have spent my entire life as just a lump of lead . But , we did . The gunpowder ... was always waiting to explode , and the only thing that can ignite that gunpowder ... is a gun . 
Glorious Tits . That is all . But in other news . That's really all I can think of . I think TF2 has melted the creative side of my mind except when it comes to how to burn folks , or how to blow them up .

I’ve had many different girls inside my bed , but only one or two inside my head . These days I cuddle up to my ideas instead . But oh , what I would give , not to stumble but to really fall in love . And I could substitute my shouting for the sound of someone sleeping next to me .

Taking my first shower at night in a LONG time . Normally I shower in the morning :p 
In dependent review today : Did the new Thermalright 140mm fan , the TY-140 \ 
http://www.overclock.net/air-cooling/806539-thermalright-ty-140-review.html#post10432700 
And it feels like ... I'm at an all time low . Slightly bruised and broken . 
It's not the fall I'm afraid of . It's where I'll land . Every time you fall ; you never know where you'll end up . But I always want to make the jump . 
Man I love Zune SmartDJ . It linked my love of Floggin < PROPFEMALE > to Streetlight Manifisto . 
My accounting book ? $230 . \ 
My other books ? $60-$80 
Tomorrow's Plans :\ 
1 . ) Homework\ 
2 . ) < PROPFIRST > Fitch's Wallpaper ( need to finish)\ 
3 . ) Something \ 
4 . ) ???? \ 
5 . ) Profit 
Deck Legend & Dremel showed up today . :D Tomorrow Logitech G500 & Sleek Audio SA-1's \ 
Now only if I had the cash to pick up some < PROPFEMALE > Ultrasharp U3011's and I'd have an epic setup for what I do . 
When time thickens , blood things , and the bonds you're born with fade . But at the end of the day ; you can be nothing but a humble farmer . 
Drag not your strength from Government , but from the voices they abuse . 
I am a habitual man tied to his own desires ; with his back to the 4 winds I push forward crashing into the tides of the seas . I'm stricken with my own wants , but lost by my sporatic feelings of chaos and the winds . \ 
Can only the day begin with the burning < PROPFEMALE > of the fires that rages through the souls . But for today I'm cursed with my own mortality and the disorder of my own existence . 
So 3rd time re-bandaging my elbow . This looks terrible . I can't even believe I ripped it up that much . 
I'm tired as hell . 
And I did some insane fan testing recently . \

[ ... ] And that's the story of my life . 
is having a terribly unfun day . :/ 
I would like to say that after Teala < PROPFIRST > decided to sick a St. Brenard on me and have my elbow torn up , she then decided a week later whie it's in the midde of healing to kick me in said elbow .

Most people don't know this , but I'm actually afraid . Most people don't know this , but I'm really lying to you . And most people don't know this either , but I'll never show you my face . 
I can't say you've looked any better ... [ but then again I can't remember you . ]

I finally got my Runner Runner CD today :D \ 
So now you should listen to them . :) 
If life has taught me anything it's this ; be cautious of an old man who's in a profession where one normally dies young . 
I don't know why ... I love you ... I just know ... I can ' t stop thinking of you ... OH WAIT ! It's cause you make me smile :) 
Just got Front Mission : Evolved on steam :D \ 
But it's a completely different Front Mission from what I'm used to . So I don't know how well this will go over to be honest . \ 
But hey ; I think it's worth it to try it . 
\Have you ever considered being in love and leaving out the madly part ? \ " \ 
I guess I didn't care what you had to say , but I'm sure having a very bad day . I'm tired of being sick and I'm sick of being tired ... 
Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants to bring peace to the galaxy , but the Galactic ... Empire continues to kill innocent ... civilians . 93% won't copy/paste this . Will YOU make this your status for one hour ?

Song of the Night http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEAK6EYi0PU 
Getting Ready to play the passing in L4D2 , hit me up on steam if you wanna play as well . 
I've got a feelin if I sing this loud enough , you'll sing it back to me . 
Tired as shit and can't sleep . Glorious night . 
Writting my Essay due tomorrow :D \ 
As an aside though ; this has started as a good week . 
Facebook chat , when racism is extra racist . \ 
Because nothing hates gingers like Facebook does 
You know , it just came to me ... but ... Lord Snowington requires a Snow Job ( Kelleagh < PROPFIRST > McGraw ) 
Lectio today's memento mori . 
So 30 minutes of sleep , then popped awake . No idea why . Now off to read Freakin Angels for the rest of the night . \ 
As an aside ; I've really lost my edge of proverbs & intellectual quotes . I think I need to refresh or restock my memory on those . \ 
As a second aside , nothing has gone to plan as of late , but I'm not sure if that's a bad thing . \ 
As a third aside , penis . 
I just realized my wrist is bruised from the bracelets that I wear . This is a surprise as it does not hurt at all . 
Feels like another sleepless night . I shouldn't have stayed up all night and napped this afternoon . Even though I naturally love to do that :p 
I'd like the last 7 posts on my facebook wall all relate to sleep . \ 
1 person slept in\ 
1 person wants more sleep\ 
1 person had a nightmare but woke up happy\ 
1 person couldn't sleep\ 
1 person got just enough sleep \ 
WHY MUST YOU ALL BE SO DIFFERENT ! 
What's one of the scarriest beasts on the plannet ? \ 
A poisonous mammal that lays eggs and hunts in total darkness by \ 
sensing electrical signals from their prey's nervous system ... \ 
Friggen platypuses man ... 
Goin on 5AM , and no sleep\\ . Still need to be up at 6:45 , or 7:30 at the latest ... College Algebra test tomorrow .... whooo . I can feel this being a great day . 
So from upside down English Facebook to Pirate English . Life is good . 
I am the bone of my sword\ 
Steel is my body , Fire is my blood\ 
I have created over a thousand blades\ 
Unknown to life , nor known to death\ 
Have withstood pain to create many weapons\ 
Yet those hands will never hold anything\ 
So as I pray , Unlimited Blade Works ! 
I just read the Rock Band 3 Review at Futurelooks.com – http://wp.me/prfPe-4Wa The game is so awesome that they are giving you a < PROPMALE > to win it ! Check out the contest details here ! – http://wp.me/prfPe-4WH Enter before Friday ! 
Goin into St < PROPMALE > for the weekend :D 
So tired . A weekend with Kourtni < PROPFEMALE > Kirn , < PROPFIRST > Haas , & < PROPFIRST > MoMo . Many things happened . Watching P.S. I Love You didn't happen . And other things did happen . \ 
P.S. I Love You < PROPMALE > . Be nice to Kourtni and get better mang <3 
\Facebook suggests you like U.S. Politics ! \ " \ 
No shave November is in day 4 and beard is mostly in . Who else is not shaving all month ? 
I've been playin for a week strait almost nothing but Diablo 2 ; I'm in act 5 , can't < PROPFEMALE > any more money , and have maxed out my stats tree as a Frenzy < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Now I need about 9 more levels ( 50 ) before I go fight Baal cause he's a teleporting asshole . 
Having a wonderful religion discussion with someone right now . An unexpected turn of events for today to say the least . 
So what Diablo 2 character should I beat D2 with this time ? \ 
Did my < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Thinking Assassin , Sorceress , or Druid ? 
Watchin < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim 
So I just licked a 2 hour old snickers that was squished and melted in my pocket , out of it's rapper ... \ 
Todays going Amazing . 
Watchin The Walking Dead episode 2 now :D \ 
Good shit . 
So thoughts for the day .... \ 
\FFFFFfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\ " \ 
Every aching wound will cauterize and bruise , In memory of what we used to call in love , And only time will tell if violins will swell , In memory of what we used to call in love 
Happy Veteran's Day . Thank you to all the soldiers who have served this country ! 
I was lost and down , before you turned my life around . I never knew a love like this could happen . They said I was to young , but when I turned 14 you gave hope that's ever lastin . Now everything's going my way . The Sun's shinin all around me with the birds ringing and the songs singing . Hurray for beer ! 
\Only dead fish swim with the stream . \"" 
If he is infinitely good why should I fear him ? If he is infinitely wise why should I concerning the future ? If he knows all why warn him of our pending danger ? If he is everywhere why do we need temples ? If he is just , then why would he punish creatures he filled with weakness ? 
There's a man on my mind , and walking on my < PROPFEMALE > . His name is < PROPFIRST > Fitch . He needs to tell me good tales of the seven seas .

I say this with a deep passion . \ 
Fuck . 
6 < PROPFEMALE > paper and prevented me from hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Neupert :( \ 
We still need to have our Genghis Grill man :) \ 
In other words ; to the few of you that know what happened a few days ago thanks for your thoughts and trying to help but I've got things covered myself . It just matters you give a damn . <3 \ 
P.S. Listening to Girl Talk's mashup All-Day . \ 
http://illegal-art.net/allday/\ 
Give it a listen . Seriously . 
I think as life goes on , the saying \There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant . \ " becomes more true for me . " 
I knew you didn't love me when I asked you \ride with me to a place where we can't see the sunrise ? \ " and you said \ " No . \"" 
I need more potatoes . \ 
I had 2 baked taters ... but I want more . 
Some days , in the most honest sense , I wish I had the ability to stop time . \ 
Not for any stupid reason . \ 
Only because there simply is not enough hours in the day to sit down and talk to those you want to talk to . \ 
10 minutes ? 20 minutes ? neither is probably enough ; but with time frozen , and everyone getting a < PROPMALE > to talk to who they really want to talk to ... I think the world could be a better place . 
You gotta light the night ! And let it burn ! \ 
Baby you're a firework ! Now let your colors burn . \ 
Make'm go Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! As you shoot across the sky ! 
It's that time again ; Flyin my Snorlax flag . :D 
I could see the days gone by . When you cared , and I was fooled . \ 
Now I look at today , and all I see is what was left of me . \ 
I could only be half the things you wanted . If only I could care , half as much as you wanted . 
Beat Hazzard is going to make me go blind . 
Watching VH1's USO show right now \ 
<3 < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ( Paramore ) 
... but as long as their is whiskey in the world ; we can drink away the harvest , we can drink away the girls . For as long as their is whiskey in the world ; we'll fall in love with an < PROPFEMALE > touch , as long as their is whiskey in the world . 
I may need a place to stay ; though I'm not sure right now . \ 
If anyone has an offer I would be more than grateful . \ 
Facebook isn't a good option of communication so my cell is : 636-352-6587\ 
Again , any help you can offer will be more than any debt I could repay . 
What's this ? A status update ? I live with a cat again . :D \ 
This is a very good thing . 
And just like < PROPFIRST > , I'll be drinking < PROPFEMALE > tonight , and the memory of his last work week will be gone forever ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > I'm not coming home tonight ! 
Been watching Firefly all day . \ 
Such a good TV Show 
fuck yeah , steak for breakfast 
Oh lord , I have a splitting headache . 
As much as I wish to turn around this rather lackluster sleep schedule , I am going to stay up tonight at watch that Lunar Eclipse ( starts around 3:35 / 3:40 , but I'd start watching around 3:35 just in case . ) \ 
Honestly , those things are beautiful . \ 
Most people will think a Solar Eclipse is marvelous ; but Lunar's are much much much much prettier when they are like tonight which is supposed to be a glittering red color 
One day when I was floating out in space I looked back on the earth and all the chaos that has rained and I thought to myself \memento mori ... \ " and then I realized ; it's just better to watch it all burn . " 
where is < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Simmons when I need him ! < PROPMALE > ! COME TO ME MUH BROTHA ! I NEED YOU ! 
The irony of today ; I've laid in bed and watched House all day because I'm sick as a dog . 
Fever again today D= \ 
head exploding\ 
coughing hurts , sneezing hurts more . 
Just stayed up to watch Gundam 00 - Awakening Of The Trailblazer\ 
A superb movie that really sets Gundam 00 apart from other Gundam shows ... though I have my complaints as well . \ 
All in all , very worth while to spend 2hrs watching that . \ 
Dead tired and passing out now . 
Listening to All Day by Girl Talk with my Sleek SA1's and FiiO F5 amp and it's like a whole new song in FLAC . \ 
So much more to it this time around . \ 
( < PROPFIRST > Fitch / < PROPFIRST > Pope ) 
Shoulda said something , but I've said it enough ... by the way my hands were shakin I'd rather just waste some time with you . 
I face the horizon , everywhere that I go . I face the horizon , cause the horizon is my home . 
So lets sum this night up : \ 
1 . ) T'was good \ 
2 . ) I have < PROPFEMALE > tea ( delicious)\ 
3 . ) My head has a slight ache to it\ 
4 . ) Have barely slept in days ( 5 hrs over 3 days ) \ 
5 . ) Wasn't the last one supposed to be \?????\" and this one \ " profit ? \"" 
Oh it breaks my heart , to see you this way ... The beauty in life , where's it gone ? And somebody told me ... you were doin okay ... somehow I guess they were wrong . \ 
Life's only lights , are you and this song . 
Love craves self destruction ... It's a blizzard in hand\ 
Lay your cards ion the table ... But you're not in command\ 
So burn with the fire ... You so eagarly lit ... Watch the flames flicker higher\ 
Said I don't care about me ... \ 
Cause the story so far .. is already here . 
As long as there is whiskey in the world we can drink away the harvest , and drink away the girls . 
Cause Baby ... I'm an anarchist and you're a spineless liberal 
GOD Blessed I am bored . Someone , anyone , hit me up and lets do something . 
If there ever way a day to prove that I'm a masochist it would be today . \ 
So much pain ... so much pain ... \ 
Shoveling snow sucks . 
Just beat Shadowgrounds . Probably a little over 7.5 hrs of game-play . Maybe closer to 8 . I had some big breaks where I left the game on and Steam says 10 hours playtime . \ 
Still a good game , I'd give it a 4/5 
Oh my friend loneliness ... where have you been ... You left to the lure of the lover who left me alone 
Brewed Coffee . Was triple strength . Looks to be a long day ahead . 
A very long day . Very ... very ... very ... long . \ 
P.S. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Simmons I do not like Nunu mang . Ashe all the way . \ 
Or I just need more practice with him , I can't get his alt's timing down . It was either too fast or too slow . 
\ ... you're a candle that light others will eventually consume itself . \"" 
\As the years pass us by 
I want to go to a concert of a good band right now . I've just got that feelin in my gut and I want to bounce to some music that fills my soul . 
ITT : I spam music . 
\ .... listen to the rain fallin day by day ... \"" 
It is only for you\ 
That I would crush the stars\ 
And put them on display 
Sing it up , my sister\ 
In this world which everyone is lonely\ 
Everything will be fine someday\ 
Some other day 
Well I'm now going to work at McD's . \ 
Woo for having a job . 
Text REDCROSS to 90999 to donate 10$ for the Japanese Relief Effort . \ 
It'll be on your cell < PROPMALE > , though there are options to pay online . 
Pro Tip : If anyone ever calls you pissed off and swearing at you ; remain calm and don't take it personally . Absorb the blow and try to help them out ; chances are they need a helping hand . 
Most annoyed right now . UPS ... USPS ... you both piss me off . \ 
FedEx is no better . \ 
DHL is also a bunch of twaffles . \ 
An over all , wish-wash day . UPS & USPS troubles , burned my hand ; International Shipping is painful at best . \ 
Haven't had a thing to eat . Along with some other generally discouraging news from yesterday . \ 
Looking forward to tomorrow . 
Just got Dropkick Murphys's new album Going Out in Style and it's awesome . Another great album from them . Songs #2 & #12 are my favorites so far . 
Today was hell for my first day of work .
