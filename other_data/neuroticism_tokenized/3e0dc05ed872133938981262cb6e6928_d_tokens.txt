I thought I was doing something today ... Apparently I don't know anymore ... Why ??? 

My aunt left !!! And she took the baby !!! They moved out !!! Now there is only 13 people living in my house !!! 
Tired and wish I could just go to sleep ... I love your evil mind ... 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wishis that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make your ...... status for at least one hour ?............ ? Promote ( there be more ) LOVE & Acceptance ! NOT hate 
FINALLY !!! I got a job !!! This means that I can move out by March ... Go me !!! 
It would only happen to me ... Go to the hills ... < PROPFEMALE > out and talk ... Listen to music ... Then the car turns off ... WHAT THE HELL !!! In the middle of nowhere with cows and we need to jump start the car ... Wonderful ... 
Things < PROPFEMALE > Cobarubio says ... \Its hard being your friend when you make sounds like that . \"" 
Elrik bit my dog ... What the hell !!! That is not normal on any level ... 
Rue kicked < PROPFIRST > in the balls ... Epic ... Laugh out loud really loud !!! 
Crazy stupid night ... Can't believe that happened ... Thank you ... You two know who you are ... Glad it happened with you guys ... 
I was supposed to do something today ... But I forgot ... 
Why me ??? First we get stuck in the middle of nowhere with a dead car , then a car crash , and now the car was on fire ... What the hell !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Cobarubio Is straightening my hair ... She burned herself twice already ... Wow ... I love you ... 
I is tired ... I hate shopping ... Thankfully someone was there to make it awesome ... 
What's a cute zombie name ??? 
Best day ever !!! Thank you guys ... Downtown is never dull with them ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Cobarubio made my zombie cry !!! What the hell ... I have never seen my zombie do that before ... What a meanie ... 
This sucks !!! I don't know what to do !!! 
Great ... Now I don't even know if we are going ... Today will suck balls ... I can feel it ... 
Not fair ... He gets to sleep 12 hours and I get 6 ... When I ask for a nap he says no ... 
Elrik Gallardo : I rather do math than a girl ... \ 
Me : ??? \ 
Elrik : I mean I rather try to understand math than a girl ... \ 
Both : HA HA !!! 
Bored at home ... Hate having nothing to do ... 
Pretty chill day ... < PROPMALE > out with old friends , new friends , and people I just met ... Good day ... 
Damn you < PROPFIRST > !!! Just call me < PROPFEMALE > ... 
< PROPFIRST > is horrible at comforting me ... So much for being my favorite brother ... 
Damn you Turtle !!! You're still the only one that makes me feel better ... 
Talk about an awesome night ... I'm actually smiling ... Its a real smile !!! Really happy ... 
I hate being strong !!! It sucks !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Cobarubio was walking me to the bus stop . . . Then she crashed into a fence ... If this is her walking I don't want to see her driving ... I love you ... 
Going to disappear for a little bit ... I'll be back soon ... Once I feel better again ... Sorry < PROPFEMALE > ... I know I said I wouldn't disappear anymore ... But I kind of need to right now ... 
Being impulsive ... Not one of my better traits ... 
Another boring Saturday at home ... Blah ... 
Me : Can I have my movie back ??? \ 
< PROPFIRST > ( brother ): If only things were that simple my dear ... \ 
Me : Just give me my movie ... 
Okay ... So my cell phone is out of service ... Sad face ... I will fix this ... Once I figure out how to get money ... 
I fixed it ... My phone is back ... Yay !!! 
Back from San < PROPFIRST > ... Had a great time ... Thank you to the friends that made it fun ... 
What do I name my future pet rooster ??? 
Protect me from what I want ... 
The empty promises of a parent ... Stop saying that you are going to leave me alone if you're not going to leave me alone ... 
I hug brother ... He pets my head and says , \I've learned to accept and not judge ... \ " What the hell is that supposed mean ?!?!?! " 
Mission save Juanito : Epic Fail !!! 
I won't regret what I'm doing ... I'm doing it for a reason ... If what I'm doing shocks you then you apparently never knew me in the first place ... This is me ... 
I hate this feeling ... Why does it keep coming back ??? 
Sister leaves tomorrow ... She comes back Sunday ... This is so bittersweet ... 
Me : Mom i'm hungry ... \ 
Mom : What are you hungry for ??? \ 
Me : Tacos !!! \ 
Mom : Okay ... \ 
Walks away then comes to my room ... \ 
Mom : Here's a sandwich ... 
Why must < PROPFIRST > always kill my fun ??? And then stab me in the eye ??? 
Every time my phone vibrates I get excited because I think its her ... 
I hugged my dad for the first time in like 3 weeks ... I missed his hugs ... =( 
Why does everyone think something is wrong ??? I'm fine ... 
There's a baptism tomorrow ... At my house ... What the hell ... Why doesn't anyone tell me earlier ??? 
Can't I ever be happy ??? Either way ... No matter what I pick I will lose ... 
At the current moment there is 22 kids at my house ... Wow ... 
Home sucks ... 
And now my past comes back ... 
One day it will all make sense ... But for now I'll just sit here confused ... Thank you < PROPFEMALE > ... And < PROPFIRST > ... 
Okay the day came a lot sooner than expected ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Cobarubio drove us and we didn't die !!! 
I hate that they know me just as well as I know me ... Grrr ... 
Crap ... I just cut my own hair ... I'm not entirely sure why though ... It sounded like a good idea at the time ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Cobarubio is taking a shower and I'm bored in her room ... Blah ... 
Yes . I'm just like < PROPMALE > !!! 
I don't know why I do these things ... 
And there is now a little robot on my side ... Every time I get a tattoo or a piercing I get really sleepy ... 
Help me out here peeps ... Give me some good songs to download ... Go !!! 
And once again it has been proven ... Blood is NOT thicker than water ... 
I hate the freaking healing process of a tattoo !!! It sucks more that the actual pain of getting it ... 
Mean little dove !!! 
Chains and whips excite me lol
