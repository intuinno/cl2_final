Today's episode of Pops In Seoul : I Feel Like needs to be uploaded RIGHT NOW . D: 
Yearbook is killing me slowly . 
I want to complain about the heat , I really really do , but I'm holding my tongue . Why ? Because if the weather remains nice , I don't even care if it stays this hot , by the end of the week , graduation will be outside and everyone I love will be able to attend . \ 
UGH . * headdesk & whimpers * 
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight . I'm too hyped up and stressed out . \ 
Father , help me in my moment of weakness . Give me the strength to continue , and the < PROPFEMALE > to see it through ' til the end . 
Running errands today . I don't know what I want to do , but I want to get out the house . It's so stifling ( and I'm not talking about the heat ) . 
Two finals and presentation on Tuesday ; long study hall , a final and party on Wednesday ; Pittsburg Airport on Thursday ; GRADUATION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
I love planning my week out . 
Just < PROPMALE > out with my mom and sisters for an hour . :) \ 
Our trip to a store began with the intention to buy < PROPFEMALE > some new clothes . We left the store with only two pairs of pants for < PROPFEMALE > , and 5 new tops for me . wtf . < PROPFEMALE > , you have enough pants . You need more shirts !!!!!!!!! 
Inadvertently discussed love with my mom today ... Despite all that's happened , my feelings haven't changed . \ 
[ ?? \ 
??? ??? ???. \

??????. <3 ] 
I want food D= 
Forgot I didn't drive this morning and almost missed the bus . It's wayyyyy too hot . x_x 
Need to get my nails done and slept all day o.o 
I stepped up on the scale to check my weight , and frowned slightly at the number . A gasp sounded from my right and I looked up to find < PROPFEMALE > standing in the doorway , her eyes wide and mouth hanging open in shock . I quickly stepped down . \ 
\ ... You checked !! \ " she whispered 
Somebody shoot me . Ugh . 
Ok nevermind . I feel better . :D 
Senior cook out :D 
Got a 69% on my calc final T.T 
Picking up < PROPFEMALE > :DDDD 
LAST DAYYYY !!!! 
BUN RIEU , JELLY & ICE CREAM CAKE =D 
My feet hurt and I have a headache , but I spent the day with all my sisters so the blisters are worth it . <3 
Once again I'm in the corner . * sighs * It doesn't feel like I just graduated . I still think I have school tomorrow . 
9.30 / 10.00 is now my 6.00 D= It's still too early !! 
Stuck in traffic outside of Pittsburgh . * headdesk * 
Just spent the most amazing weekend with my older sister , and I can't wait to see her again in two weeks ! Hopefully < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > will be able to tag along . xP But we'll either have to squeeze ....... or take two cars . 
I still feel like I have school tomorrow , and the next day , and the next . When will this feeling change ? 
Omg ANOTHER creeper tried to add me . Wtf ? MAKE IT STOP !!!! 
Massive cleaning ....................................... Ugh . 
Wireless is on the < PROPMALE > . * sighs * 
I wish I still had school just to get away from a mother who thinks I need to be talked down because I'm so arrogant , a sister who does nothing but what 
she wants , and a helpless sister who clings to me all the time . I can't take it anymore . 
Grounded , internet is gone , car battery is disabled ... What else could she possibly do to make me even more miserable ? 
And just like that , I'm suddenly ungrounded . Sometimes I think she's just hormonal ..... 
Bored ............. 
So I'm getting my internet back tonight . Yayyy . 
My computer shuts off every time I plug in my external hard drive T.T 
My grad picnic is no longer a picnic , nor is it mine . I don't want to have it anymore , but if I cancel that's unfair to everyone and mom would just get pissed . 
I'M BACK :DDDD 
Rain ...... 
Errands to run , then swimming pool . :D 
Had tons of fun today ~ Love you guys ! Let's do it again ! :DD 
At the dentist's office with < PROPFEMALE > . She doesn't even know the word ' time management ' =_=

Stupid computer . 
< PROPFIRST > is on his wayyyyyyy ~~~ :D 
< PROPFEMALE > just ruined the funny . DD: 
Guess who's here ? :D 
Ortho tomorrow DDDD: In Indiana . Wtf . 
Save me from my mom's self righteous lectures . =_= 
I don't want to be here . 
Done . If I get braces , the process will only last a year and a half . =| 
People need to learn how to fucking drive . 
Ef my life ........... 
I need another fix . Argh . 
Being the middlewoman ... is a lot of work . 
Big ass to-do list today . effffffff 
Father , hold me for I am weary and flailing in the dark without a light . Guide me back to Your side , for I know not which way to go . 
This emotion I'm feeling feels almost like I don't feel anything . Make it stop . 
Two people just left , but more people are arriving . * headdesk * 
I love Vietnamese people's reactions to American movies . xD\ 
My cousin and his girlfriend are sitting on the couch watching Home Alone 4 . 
Again . I love Vietnamese people's reactions to American movies . All my cousins and their significant others are seated around my kitchen table watching Quarantine . xDD I can't wait to hear their reactions ( I'm in the other room with < PROPFIRST > :D ) They think it's about ghosts rotflmao 
My mom ruins all the fun . \ 
Right when the movie was getting good , she took Quarantine out and put in Avatar . It's 2.17 am !!!!! She's gonna be up until 5 and then bitch at me tomorrow . I just know it . 
Alvin : I love how we're all Asian here but for one American . \ 
Us : We're all American here . \ 
Ryan : Yeah , except for Tai . \ 
Us : What , why ? \ 
Ryan : He's from Hawaii . 
Had tons of fun with friends today ! :) LET'S DO IT AGAIN !! 
Why is it that when I do everything no one says a word or even think to help , but the moment I stop they lash out at me in self righteous anger ? 
This past week has been bittersweet . 
Another busy weekend ahead . :) Wish me luck . 
I love < PROPMALE > Cruise ! <3 
I miss you ... 
< PROPFEMALE>'s getting engaged ! Going to MD for a night ~

Sometimes < PROPFIRST > makes facial expressions that freak me out , or make her eyes shine really black . > < 
? ?? ?? ? ??. \ 
<3 
GaeIn : When I heard about it , my heart was jammed with anxiety . I thought my best friend in the whole world was going to be snatched away by InHee . \ 
JinHo : ... That will never happen . \

2 . No Other\ 
3 . It's You 
When I leave , nothing short of complete and utter misery will bring me back here again . I've had enough . 
So apparently I've lost Mom's trust . Honestly it's not even worth it to work so hard to get it back when I'll just lose it again the next time I make a mistake . 
Current progress of < PROPFEMALE > Chiu's DVD :\ 
Completed : 1 . BONAMANA , 2 . No Other , 3 . It's You , 4 . SORRY SORRY , 5 . SORRY SORRY - Answer , 6 . One Love\ 
To be done : Everything else . xP 
Lost my glasses . FML . 
Stuck at the mall without my glasses . Great . 
I seriously need to find my glasses . >> 
FOUND THEM . 
Ungrounded . :D 
My language bar won't show up ! >> Oh , and < PROPFIRST > is convinced BONAMANA is about her . lmao 
Loving DongHae's new song . :) It's so cute , even though I'm not sure I got the right gist of it . lmao\ 
Oh well , going to go watch \Alice in Wonderland\ " with Mom ~ ( the one with < PROPFIRST > Depp <3 ) " 
My language bar has returned ! :DDDD 
EunHae's baby is my new obsession . xP\ 
<3<3 
It's annoying how Mom complains about having work , but hangs in my room talking to me and playing on her cell phone until I go to bed just to get her to leave . 
Working , translating , subbing , saving , reviewing , working some more . xP 
I want to go see \Inception . \ " But I have to wait until next week . D: \ 
LOL at people overreacting to SHINee's new album name . What's the big deal ? They're thinking too much on it . 
< PROPFEMALE > tonight ! Whooo ~ ~ 
So tired ... and we haven't left the house yet . 
Just got bombarded with Vietnamese at Mass . God , I miss this . 
100+ Viets in one house = VERY HOT . * dying from the heat * 
Oh dear , they're breaking out the Hennessy . xD Like this if you know the result . 
Bored ... 
Relaxing at my godparents ' home . :) I wonder if I'll have to pick my mom up . 
< PROPMALE>'s Dominion with Mom , sisters , cousins and < PROPFIRST > today !! :DD 
Just had fun at < PROPMALE>'s Dominion with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , Mom , sisters and cousin . :) <3 
Showered and refreshed . :) Great ending to an amazing day . <3 I have the whole room to myself until Mom and sisters come back ~ 
Just got a lecture from my godmother on things I have no interest in . And a job in DC from < PROPFEMALE > after college ? Does she not know I'm going to be a teacher ? 
I don't wanna get out of beddddddddd !!

[\I Like What I Like 
I WANT MORE SUKISHO . \ 
SoraxSunao = Perfect\ 
YoruxRan = HOT ( I'm going to miss them ... even if Ran is a little annoying . )\ 
ShinichiroxNanami = Typical ... but sweet\ 
< PROPFEMALE > xGaku = Awwwwww :DDDD I'm so glad they're together ! I thought < PROPFEMALE > was too indifferent to take Gaku's affections seriously , but awwwwwww ! <3 \ 
Soushi and Ryouya should just follow the crowd and get together already ... xP 
Sometimes , my family really pisses me off . 
< PROPFEMALE > , the bitch , took my internet away ! 
< PROPFIRST > almost fell into the toilet . xDD 
I just woke up to find my door open . I assumed < PROPFIRST > opened it . Then I find < PROPFEMALE > sneaking out , away from my computer . I'm pissed as hell . 
I ask for my DVDs back , she shuts her door and locks it . 
Stupid MegaVideo and its \You have watched 72 minutes today . Please wait another 54 minutes or click here to enjoy unlimited\ " bullshit . * pouts * " 
Locking my door . I wish my door was loud enough to wake me so I can bitch at < PROPFEMALE > once she sneaks in , rather than just having it locked and preventing her from making a move . It would be so much more satisfying . 
Mission : Success ! 
My mom really thinks I'll still be living with her when I'm 30 . 
PEOPLE . STOP IT WITH THE ANGSTY EUNHAE . IT'S WAY TOO DEPRESSING . I thought angst was KangTeuk's thing ! \ 
I want fluffy/happy EunHae !!! > <

I don't want braces . 
UGH . MY TEETH ARE SO SORE . I HATE THIS . D: \ 
Someone make it stooooooooooppppppppppp !!!! I keep grinding my teeth !!! T T___T T 
Going shoe shopping with mom and < PROPFEMALE > later . :) 
Nevermind about my previous status . Mom wants me to help clean the basement . -.- 
Ugh . Someone shoot me . 
My chest hurts .................. </3 
Found an interesting fic , with a good story line . \ 
Unfortunately , the writer needs a lesson in grammar . \

OMG < PROPFIRST > IS HERE . 
OMG < PROPFIRST > * AND * TAEUK ARE HERE ! 
Dentist appointment today . :| So nervous !! But @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > will be with me . <3 
A mom who bitches at me when she doesn't have coffee and blames me for everything going wrong and a sister who doesn't get up off her ass to help . Yay me . 
Mom's grounding < PROPFEMALE > again not for being lazy and not helping out , but for telling my mom to shut up . \

WHERE IS ALL THE EUNHAE ?!?!? \ 
* deprived * 
Mom's mad again . \ 
So what else is new . 
I had the weirdest dream . Like , whoa . \ 
I'm probably watching too many Korean dramas ... 
< PROPFIRST > said she wants to marry me , and the only other person \allowed\ " to marry me is YunHo . \ 
OMGOMGOMG MY MOM JUST GAVE ME MY NEW LAPTOP !!!! 
Typical Mom : we go shopping , then get in line , and she goes for last minute things , leaving me moneyless and alone with the impatient cashier . >.> 
I'm too upset to sleep . Text me if you're still up . 
Braces tomorrow . :( 
Heading to the orthodontist . :( In a few hours , my diet will be ruled by my braces for 1.7 years . 
It's official now . I have braces . > < 
I hate braces . 
My mom keeps mistaking < PROPMALE > for < PROPMALE > \Diddle\ " from PSYCH . I'd be amused if it wasn't the 100th time she's done so . " 
FALSE ALARM . I thought my new laptop didn't have WMM , and FREAKED , because how else am I going to be able to sub MVs for < PROPFEMALE > Chiu's DVD ???? ( Or for anyone else !!! ) But I did some more snooping and finally found it . It was in a different folder . And it's a newer , ritzier version , too . :) \ 
Only problem now ? Figure out how to use it ... 
Fuck . Someone distract me . Now . \ 
Please ... I'm at a loss . 
Listening to this guy is both a reprieve and a punishment . The songs sing how I feel , but the lyrics hit a little too close to home for comfort . * sighs*\ 
And < PROPFEMALE > Verner , you rock . :) 
Shassie goodness = love\ 
Psych writers who love Shassie just as much = pure win\

I always leave my College Writing class with an urge to go home and write . \ 
Professor Myer is amazing . <3 
Dowd/Omundson : You are one sick dude . \ 
Hotch/Gibson : How did you think I found you ? \ 
----------------------------------------------------- \ 
Criminal Minds <3 \ 
Omundson plays a mean bad guy , like , seriously . <3<3 
Reid : Is that legal ? \ 
Garcia : Of course not . We'll both go to prison , and you'll become someone's bitch . \ 
Reid : * pauses * ..... Really ?? \ 
-------------------------------------------------- \ 
Criminal Minds <3 
< PROPMALE > and Garcia = two of the coolest geeks , EVER . <3 
Elle : Can you get into those records ? \ 
Reid : Despite the fact that they're probably expunged , you can find the faintest < PROPFEMALE > of deletions , successfully recreate the file , thereby sending us all to prison for computer felony fraud counts . \ 
Elle : ... We can make bail . Garcia ? \ 
Garcia : Already in . \ 
--- \ 
I reaaaaaaaaaaally don't want to be living at home right now . \ 
She's angry at me over shoes . 
Hotch : * cocks his gun*\ 
Blackwolf : Put that away . \ 
Hotch : What ? \ 
Blackwolf : You won't need it . \ 
Hotch : * scoffs*\ 
Blackwolf : There are many paths to the same place . Trust me . \ 
Hotch : * raises an eyebrow * Just so you know , you sound like a fortune cookie . * pulls out a beat stick instead*\ 
----------------- \ 
Criminal Minds ? 
Hotch : Get down !! * shoots the cult members * Are you okay ? \ 
Blackwolf : * from the ground * You just had to shoot somebody , didn't you ? \ 
Hotch : ... \ 
-------------------- \ 
Just can't win with this guy , can you , Hotch ? \ 
Gideon : Children ? \ 
Hotch : Fine . We got them out before they got here . We took out these four . \ 
Reid : Without firing a shot ? \ 
Blackwolf : Captain < PROPFEMALE > here shot number five . \ 
Hotch : You're welcome . * shares a disgruntled look with Blackwolf * Number five is cut up pretty bad , I don't think he's gonna make it . \ 
Blackwolf : * mutters * At least I didn't shoot him . \ 
Morgan : I think I'd rather be shot . \ 
---------- \ 
Garcia : Not all of his alibis check out . And you know that if there is one loose thread , I will find it , I will pull it , and his story will completely unravel . \ 
--------------------------- \ 
Elle : \The Stripping Bandit . \ " That's terrible . It makes it sound like the bandit's doing the stripping . \ 
Detective : Do you know how hard it is to catch a bike with a car ? \ 
Gideon : Let's not think about it . \ 
---- \ 
Company manager : If you think about it , I'm just profiling , like you guys . \ 
Gideon : Well , let's not think about it . \

Client : So , I think I'm a necrophiliac . \ 
Trainer : Um , what ? \ 
C : I think I'm a necrophiliac . \

Priceless xD 
Mom and I were in the kitchen when we heard noises coming from upstairs . \ 
Mom : Is < PROPFIRST > crying or is < PROPFEMALE > singing ? \ 
Me : * bursts out laughing *

Sometimes moms just take the fun out of everything . :( 
What the heck ? Now people are trying to start a < PROPFEMALE > vs < PROPFEMALE > war ?!? What is all this JYJ vs HoMin nonsense ?!?! Don't they have something better to do with their lives than mess with people and laugh at their misfortune ?!?! \ 
Where has all the compassion gone ?! Is it really that amusing to watch people fight , hate , scream and cry ?? What has become of us as a people ? Where is our humanity ? \ 
-- ALWAYS KEEP THE FAITH -- 
Help me pick a good name for a male lead , please ~ ! :) He's a traditional arts < PROPMALE > . He's fun and outgoing , but sensitive and brooding . He's almost emotionally stunted because of a crippling betrayal in his past , so he's become very promiscuous . What would be a good name for him ? \

Loving my dress , hating where I am . I want to go back to < PROPFEMALE>'s house . :( 
I don't know who we're waiting on , but whoever it is , he or she is LATE . D < 
< PROPFEMALE > is so pretty !! 
is too miserable to concentrate on writing her English paper . \ 
R.I.P. , my laptop . I never gave you a name , but I loved you for the duration of the 2 months I had you . 
Ice cream + English paper due the next morning = all nighter . Whoot . 
Jus got in bed . I have 3 hours until class . PLEASE DO NOT TEXT ME OR COMMENT ON MY FACEBOOK UNTIL THEN . Thank you , and good morning(night ) . :) 
I finished my paper at 7 , got in bed at 7.30 with plans to wake up 3 hours later for class ; I over slept and hurried to school , only to find out my first class of the day was cancelled . Great . My professor didn't even think to send an e-mail ??? I was up at 7 !! D < \ 
I feel like crap and I just want to go home . :( 
Random Girl #1 : If I were a guy , I think I'd be gay . \ 
Random Girl #2 : Yeah , me , too . I wouldn't be able to handle girls . \ 
Me , walking in front of them : ... xD 
My house is being bombarded by rocks and tree branches . Whoot . 
My house is leaking and I don't know how . Great . 
My College Writing professor ? Yeah , she's a psychic detective . :D How awesome is that ? 
Baltimore ~ ! 
Baltimore was awesome ~ < PROPMALE > out with ThienLin HoBui , < PROPMALE > Livengood , < PROPFIRST > Boyle , < PROPFIRST > Petersen and the gang , ate a few pounds of Korean food , explored the city , and had a blast . :) Went to the movies with < PROPFEMALE > Tr ? n , < PROPFIRST > V ? Nguy ? n and < PROPMALE > Santone today . I'm beat tired , but all in all , this weekend was tons of fun . 
\MASTERMIND\ " IS OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :DDDDDD <3<3<3<3<3 " 
Go to my links and CHECK OUT BEAST'S NEW MINI ALBUM . :) \ 
\Mastermind\ " <3<3 " 
has her laptop back <3<3<3<3<3<3 :DDDDD \ 
Go to my links and CHECK OUT BEAST'S NEW MINI ALBUM . :) \Mastermind\ " <3<3 " 
has a calc exam today . :S 
is enraged by how ignorant , rude , unapologetic , and self-absorbed people can be . 
is incredibly happy due to BEAST's new MV and SHINee's MV teaser . \ 
It's kind of ridiculous how fast these guys can switch up my mood . lol <3 \ 
GO TO MY LINKS AND CHECK THE MV OUT . :) 
And ....... my mood just plummeted again . \ 
You might think it's sad or pathetic that I care so much about what goes on with them , but that doesn't matter to me . You don't understand because you don't have something you care just as much about in your own life . To me , that's what I think is sad . 
just got back from Open House . :) It was fun walking through the halls , but I felt like a high schooler again once I sat in the desks . I chatted with my awesome teachers ( such as < PROPMALE > Stough and < PROPMALE > Bertani ) , explored what changed/what stayed the same , out-walked my mom ( and the other parents ) , and all-in-all had a pleasant time . The Channel One video made me tear up a little , though . But only a little . 
just took her EDU exam :S \ 
I hope I did relatively well on it ... 
? ???? 
just got a free phone . :DDDDDD 
is working on her fic . \ 
So get off my back , < PROPFEMALE > Tr ? n . xP <3<3 
Hanging with my mom , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > at St. < PROPMALE > . :) 
JUST GOT HER NEW PHONE IN THE MAIL . :D \ 
But now I have to let it charge for 8 hours before I can use it . :( 
loves her new phone . :) 
I like today . Warm sun , cool breeze , short classes ... I think I'll atually < PROPFEMALE > outside my house today . :) 
Guess what my wallpaper is on my new phone ~ xP 
I am so tired . :( I wish I could sleep in on the weekends . 
Today is a nice day , too ! :O 
Carole : I want my phone back . \ 
Me : I want my bed back . \ 
Carole : And your cat . \ 
Me : Huh ? \ 
Carole : I feel a fleshy thing below me . I'm assuming it's your cat , anyway . 
is feeling very unmotivated today . :| 
< PROPFIRST > got a booster seat , and it's a perfect fit . :) So no worries about a crowded backseat anymore , guys ! lol 
wtf ? I just had a nightmare about being 45 minutes late for my English class and woke up feeling terrified before the stupidity of it sank in . I'm pathetic . :( 
My professor still hasn't e-mailed my essay back to me . :| 
In my EDU class , a girl wrote \Make sure to not be bias\ " on the board during her group presentation . Please tell me I'm not the only one bothered by that . " 
Another thing about EDU today , another girl in the same group told a student that she was wrong when she answered incorrectly . Big no-no for a teacher ! 
I'm really nervous about teaching my first lesson in EDU on Friday , but I'm just as excited . That never happens ! I think I just might be made for this . :) 
I got a B on my essay ! A freaking B ! * cries * 
So , apparently in Florida , < PROPFEMALE > , North and South < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > , my sisters and I are considered Sunday children . Good to know . 
I ... am listening to After School on repeat ? O.o What has come over me ?? 
is speechless after < PROPFEMALE > Nguyen didn't pick up on the perverseness that is SNSD's \Genie\ " MV . " 
I feel strangely listless today . :/ 
People in my class keep pissing Congelio off . Grow up ! ( Aimed at my classmates , not Congelio . ) 
just had an awesome time hanging out with < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Fox-Sierra . :) 
got into another fight with her mom . \ 
* tired * :| 
My mood just got a whole lot better . :) 
We just spent 10 minutes watching clips from \Whose Line Is It Anyway ? \ " in Psychology . xP <3 \ 
Watching EHB Ep 12 with < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Fox-Sierra :) 
Why do I even try ? 
Speech class is cancelled :) I had two presentations today , but now I only have one to worry about . Ahhhhh ! 
Getting a lipids test , and I'm starving . Ugh . Can't wait until this is over . 
Is it bad that I've stopped crying whenever my mom yells at me ? I feel a bit numb , like something inside me broke . :| What does this mean ? 
Once again she starts to lecture all of us , but ends up lecturing only me . 
? I wanna love you ; I can't live without you . Close your eyes and take my hands . I wanna have you ; I really need you . Now , leave everything behind . I wanna love you ; I can't live without you . You only need to be close to me . I wanna have you , I'll give you my everything . I'll promise it all to you now . ? 
What a way to spend my morning . I wish I were at home . 
At this moment in time , < PROPMALE > > Kemaru\ 
Sorry ~ xD < PROPMALE > is just too adorable . \ 
< PROPMALE > <3 < PROPFIRST > , hwaiting ~

You guys rock , and I love you ! <3

Today is a gorgeous day . :) 
Me : Where's my back ? \ 
Mom : Behind you . \ 
Me : ... \

Thank you , Mr. Stauffer , for teaching trig function graphs so well , because now I can just sit back and enjoy Prof . Congelio's reenactment of graph changes . <3

< PROPFEMALE > Tr ? n , did you know that there was a whole bunch of YooSu chorusing in \Through the Forest\ " on the 2004 Summer SM Town album ? :) They sound so good together

< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Fox-Sierra : If I'd known what she said in English , I would have bitch smacked her . \ 
Me : * misheard him * What does that even mean ? Fish smack . \ 
< PROPMALE > : Bitch smack ! \ 
Me : Oh ! ... Isn't it \bitch slap ? \ " \ 
Why do I have to be so careful about what I say all the time ? Shouldn't I be able to relax around certain people ?? Why does it feel like I'm walking on eggshells ? I don't think it's going to work out anymore . 
If I could cover my ears , shut my eyes , and bite my tongue , I could just drown in the solitude . I really want to . But people keep pulling me back out . Stop it . It hurts . 
It might be selfish , but it's better to run away to protect yourself than to stay and wait to be abandoned . I can't withstand that kind of pain very well . 
I wish Vietnamese people weren't so gossipy and meddlesome . I hate having to be so careful about what I do or say and who I spend time with . 
I had the strangest dream last night ! At least it was a good one . :) \ 
Gonna help < PROPFIRST > with homework , then wrap XMas presents with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > ! <3 
I wish I had internet . :(

Without extra credit , I have a B+ in Speech . :) 
is reading a new book . Interesting , thought-provoking , and overall a good read . However , I've already figured out who the main character really is . * sighs * 
just made homemade chocolate ice cream . ^^V 
Finished the book . Loved it !! I was right about the main character , and I have a love-hate thing going on with the female lead as per usual . Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > ! :) 
McDonald's hot chocolate is mm-mm good . :) 
Am I over thinking this too much ? 
It's been said you only fall in love once , but I don't believe it because every time I look at you I fall in love all over again . \

You bring out the best in me . You make me whole . You make me see the world the way it should be . You make me feel things so completely . You've shown me what love really is , that dreams do come true . I know so many things now that you've taught me what life and love are about . But , one thing I never want to find out is what I would do if I had to live without you . There are just some things I don't need answers to . <3

* spazzes * Damn game for making me choose between EunHae !!!! 
Just finished an AMAZING drama . When I want dramatic love stories full of backstabbing bitches , twisted love triangles , and romantic scenarios , I turn to Korean dramas . But there is no beating Japanese human interest dramas about family ties , the human psyche , and societal morals full of tearjerkers that have nothing to do with \they so belong together !!! \ " twists . <3 " 
Me : It's so hairy !!!! \ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sierra : That's what she said . \ 
Pffffffffft Omg and < PROPFIRST > was sitting RIGHT THERE . I bit my cheek . D: 
I have a headache from all the reading I did on little sleep , but I am now an official employee at < PROPFEMALE>'s . :) 
Me : It's 7:22 . How about some AC ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Tran : ... \ 
Me : ... I guess that's a \no ...? \ " \

Kang HoDong : Love makes you blind , but marriage opens your eyes . \ 
xDDDD <3 
Just got off work . Closing two registers on your own is kind of stressful ... especially when it seems like everyone else already left and the lights are off . :S 
There is a troll on allkpop who keeps denying that she is a troll and changing her story . But that's not what really pisses me off . Ooooooh no . In addition to her annoying trolling , she is also claiming that she used to date YunHo and saying some very delusional and explicit things . W.T.F. WAKE . UP . \ 
Just great . I asked why my mom came into my room and she got all upset . Someone just shoot me and get it over with . * headdesk * 
Had a fun and memorable evening out with my two best friends < PROPMALE > Usher and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . :) I wish we could do it more often . <3 
I'm all over the place today : Monroeville , Pittsburgh , then back to Greensburg for work . I only wish I could grab some Bubble Tea somewhere . 
People have been calling off for the past few days , and my manager has asked me several times if I could cover for them . I had legit reasons to say no ( i.e. school , being out of town , etc . ) , but if it happens again today , I'm probably still going to say no . Why ? Because Wednesday is my designated Spend Time With < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Day . A less legit reason , but a good one nonetheless . xP 
Alvin : Who signed me up for this ?!? ......... Oh , I did . \ 
xDD 
Had a great day at work today . :) I've only been working for about a month , but already management has taken notice of me . Makes me feel really good about myself . ^^ 
So ... DongHae and SiWon are slated to be leads in a new Taiwanese drama . Win ! \ 
The director recently stated that he was considering including a male-male kiss scene . Even more win ! \ 
There's a possibility that the scene will occur between DongHae and SiWon . NOT WIN . It should be EunHae !!!! D: ( Yes , I'm biased , but SiWon belongs to HeeChul anyway . ) [ Jeannette Szeto ]
