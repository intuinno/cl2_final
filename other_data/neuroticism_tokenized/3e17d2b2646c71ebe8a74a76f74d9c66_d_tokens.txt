Sorry there's a huge lack of content on here . I'm not into these \social\ " sites since I'm not exactly a social person . :) " 

Well , here's my \monthly\ " visit to Facebook ... about as often as I visit my parents . * tongue in cheek * " 
I hate social networking sites . The only reason I created a profile here is so I could have some kind of contact with my daughters !! Anyway ... to all my family who have been wondering , yes , I am still very much alive . :) 
What's on my mind ... hmm . Nothing & everything , and many things in between . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to anyone out there who thinks holidays are happy . LOL . Love & glad tidings to my family and friends . 
24 hours before the party starts ... 29 hours ' til the year ends . 
Why is it considered racist to think there should be a < PROPFIRST > F . Kennedy day if there's a < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , Jr. day ? 
Thank you to everyone who wished me Happy Birthday yesterday . :) 364 more days ' til I'm FORTY . ( I bet that makes my parents feel old , LOL ! ) 
Apparently , my lil cousins are all growed up now . * sigh * The babies , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , have had CHILDREN . I remember when they were so little that they couldn't play block tag with all the rest of us cousins , and could ride their daddy's pet pit bull , < PROPMALE > , like he was a pony . :) Congrats , cousins , on your recent arrivals . 
Buncha damn idiots screaming at the TV in the other room , while watching a group of grown men in colorful tights chasing each other around and squabbling over a little brown inflated piece of leather . The Stupid Bowl is lame . Gonna go play Wizard 101 for a while now ... 
The older I get , the more I turn into my parents . 20 years ago , that would've been a fate worse than death ( because they didn't know anything about anything when I was a teenager ) , but now ~ it lets me know I didn't get to where I am if it hadn't been for who showed me the way . :) XOXO to my mom & dad . 
I didn't watch the Stupid Bowl , so I missed this , but < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera SCREWED UP the words to the National Anthem ! I learned the words in elementary school , andb we also said the Pledge of Allegiance every single day before classes started . Sad how unpatriotic our country has become ... and what's even sadder , the star-spangled skank they get to sing the anthem doesn't even know the words ! Shameful . 
OMG < PROPFIRST > Forsberg is retiring . :( I fell in love with ice hockey because of him . 
Watched < PROPMALE > (\The Rock \") < PROPMALE > come back to WWE last night on Monday Night RAW . I hope he's still going to make movies ~ he's awesome . :) " 
Amazing how people who don't have jobs and have no income at all always seem to have the most materially . A house , a new(ish ) car , vacationing and concert-going , the latest and greatest technology ... never wanting for anything and never EARNING any of what they have . Must be nice to be a professional loser . 
Sidetracked w/ auction yesterday , LOL , my 1st one ! Bought a car . More rambles on my new BFFs ( the pro-losers ): habitual DRUG offenders w/ NO jail time ( EVER ! ) , makes you wonder if they are narcs , right ? AND ~ icing on the cake , child services gives them their kids ( plural ) back after a failed home exam and positive drug tests . What the H-E-double-hockey-sticks is this world coming to ?? 
BUMPERSTICKER : Raising teenagers is like trying to nail jello to a tree . 
\All the police are going to get me for is running a funeral parlor without a license . \ " ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Gacy " 
< PROPFEMALE > , pineapple , lemon . Every day of the week ~ 
Want to feel humanitarian and charitable ? How about finding a cause to support that is within < PROPFEMALE>'s own borders , rather than one in some far-off country ? < PROPFEMALE > has more than enough problems right here in our own backyard - so why do we worry more about what's going on somewhere else where we can't even see it ? Look around ... 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen , 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict with drama that he brought onto himself due to his personal choices . < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt , 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada , 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon , 22 , Chauncy May , 25 , are soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention at all . Please honor them , and every other soldier who has shed blood or died for YOU and me , by reposting this as your status . 
Can't believe it's SNOWING again . I was getting SO used to the high 50's , low 60's weather . Does snow a few days after the beginning of March count as its \coming in like a lion \"?" 
When I was a kid , we could go to Grandma's for the weekend and leave our front door unlocked ; mom could leave us in the car at the bank ( with the car running & windows down ); we walked to a bus stop unescorted on the other side of the neighborhood ; we ate dinner together at 6pm every day & watched TV together at night . What happened to < PROPFEMALE>'s notion of tradition and values ? 
Smarmy bumpersticker pick-me-uppers and motivational \life is perfect and I'm ok\ " jibberish is just too flaked out for words . You'd think people would be a bit more individual and not sound quite so much like a friend-to-friend Hallmark card or a \ " gee that sounds cool so I'll steal that person's original thoughts and get praised for it\ " sort of thing . " 
Bliss is finding an website that has all the seasons and episodes of Criminal Minds that you can watch online for free . :) * happy happy joy joy * 
One of the grossest odors in the world is \wiener water . \ " The water that's left in the pot after you've finished heating up hot dogs . It smells like sweaty gym socks have been simmering in a pot of boiling water ... ugh . :( " 
Still waiting on summer to finally get here . High 70's one day , low 50's the next . Where's the warm ?? * whimper * 
Had a great time today at the family reunion ... was really awesome that so many showed up for it . :) Too bad we don't do it more often like we used to ( don't blame ME this time if < PROPFIRST > makes it an \annual\ " event !!! ) . LOVE to all my family . " 
I'm overdosing on family exposure and social gatherings ! Easter dinner today at my sister's house with mom , dad , brother , and sister's family . Have I reached my quota yet for socializing !?!? :) More good times and good food !
