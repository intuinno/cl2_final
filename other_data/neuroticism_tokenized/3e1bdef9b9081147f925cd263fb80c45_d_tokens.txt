I miss being a kid sometimes . Being 4 yrs old and sneaking out to learn how to use a gun for protection if something were to happen to my parents . Haha good times 

I have become addicted to tea . My mom made Green tea with < PROPFEMALE > , a tablespoon of sugar , and oddly coffee creamer . It actually tastes quite delicious 
Facebook is killing me today . My connection is fine , but FB apparently isn't :( 
The fragrance is dark , bitter\ 
I feel all the sadness of the world\ 
In my soul as I drink down the pain\ 
I close my eyes and hear your voice out in the distance\ 
I see your sweet face out in the rain\ 
\ 
Seems so real\ 
I just want to reach out and embrace you\ 
Only if for a while 
It's hug backwards day ! Who wants or needs a backwards hug ! <3 
A woman asked my mom to take a survey . My mom said sure . \ 
Woman : \Not a lot of people answer this 
hanging out with friend < PROPFEMALE > in Canada . She can't drink she is 12 . . . but I can ! Woohoo ! 
Getting off for a few hrs 
Hi Misa's friends . . . this is Suri , Misa's mom . Misa experienced a hit and run . She is hospitalized right now . Keep her in your prayers please . I will be checking her FB for a while until she can . If you want me to tell her anything I will 
I was trying to use crutches but I fell flat on my face . Nothing else broke and that's good . :) 
Today I was visited by a little boy named < PROPMALE > that I used to babysit . He is 6 years old now . He ran up to me holding a fake doctor's < PROPFEMALE > saying \Don't you worry Miss Demona ! I will have fixed up in no time ! \ " < PROPMALE > had me covered in Spongebob band-aids and gave me lollipop when he was done . He is so caring ! " 
I mastered the crutches and defeated the stairs ! I can defeat any other obstacles in my way ! :D 
If you think I'm cute , like this status . If you love me put a ? If I am your friend put a (: If you want to go out with me put a :D If you have ever had or do have a crush on me put a XD If you are family put a :O If your brave enough , make this your status 
I kicked my Dad in the crotch today because he totally deserved it . My dad can be so rude 
Today was a fairytale\ 
I wore a dress\ 
You wore a dark grey t-shirt\ 
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess\ 
Time slows down when ever you're around\ 
But can you feel this magic in the air ? \ 
It must have been the way you kissed me \ 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there \ 
It must have been the way Today was a fairytale \ 
It must have been the way Today was a fairytale 
Going out with my boyfriend , < PROPFIRST > for a while . Hopefully nothing bad happens like it usually does . Hopefully the worst will be if I fall while using my crutches . 
It's Misa's mom again . Misa is in trouble . She was blamed for a murder . She is having just horrible luck . It was either her or < PROPFIRST>'s younger sister . I am at such a loss for words right now . 
Misa's trial is early tomorrow . I know she didn't do it . I can't imagine that she would do such a thing . 
Poor Misa . It's thundering and Misa has a fear of thunder . No one is there to comfort her . :'( 
Good to be home ! The killer was < PROPFIRST>'s neighbor . Good thing I asked them to look for fingerprints on this piece of evidence . My mom came later to ask , but I already had . I guess great minds think alike . 
Is frolicking through the flowers singing :\ 
\Things that bother you 
? if u like/love me , > : I if im annoying , D:< if you hate me , :D if im fun , :3 if im cute . Post this to your status to see how many people comment ! 
I am like about to pass out . Good night guys I am going to bed . 
I went from happy to super uneasy and scared because my mom told me there is a thunderstorm coming . I hate thunder . . . it brings back haunting memories ... 
I am happy . I had a great night . :D <3 
Walked to the mall and got soaked . The rain doesn't bother me though . I would've brought an umbrella , but the rain can be very enjoyable if you are in a good mood . 
No rain today yay ! The one day we don't have rain is the one day I can't think of anything to do . 
Well I am going to get some coffee . Anyone want to come ? 
(( Hey people guess how old I am in real life . )) 
Vampires are not supposed to < PROPFEMALE > 
Immature love says : ' I love you because I need you . ' Mature love says : ' I need you because I love you . ' \ 
< PROPMALE > Fromm 
Tried to go to sleep , but failed because of too many thoughts running through my head 
The hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross and which to burn . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 
I don't know what to do . * sighs deeply * 
I have made a decision for those who know what I am talking about . I am very confident about it . 
I wonder what it would be like to go to a ball . I have a lot of nice dresses I never get to wear and I love to ballroom dancing . 
Some people don't believe me when I say that I used to be hot-blooded when I was younger . 
Thanks to my mom I have Teenage Dream by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > stuck in my head . Just great\ 
You think I'm pretty\ 
Without any make-up on\ 
You think I'm funny\ 
When I tell the punch line wrong\ 
I know you get me\ 
So I'll let my walls come down , down 
I am worried about Tomoe and Little Guy . Dr. Cunningham will take care of it I am sure . 
I just found out that my dad hates < PROPFIRST>'s guts . That is just great . 
I am starting to wonder where I get my personality from . 
My father now approves of < PROPFIRST > . We can now live happily . 
When you're sad I will hold you\ 
When you're bad I will scold you\ 
When you're crying I will wipe your tears\ 
When you're scared I'll fight your fears\ 
Day or night\ 
Rain or shine\ 
I know that you are only mine\ 
I will hold you either in my arms or in my heart\ 
For nothing will tear us apart 
< PROPFEMALE > Meneilley has been injured by a man with black and red hair . He was also wearing a grey hoodie . She is in the hospital right now if any wish to see her . 
I really need to get some sleep . I have been up since 1:45 yesterday . 
When I went to bed I slept for 2 hours . I can't sleep . I am too worried about everyone else . 
I hate nightmares . 
Thanks a lot Lelouch . * doing Caramelldansen * 
So tired . * yawns * I haven't slept in like 3 days . 
It seems I have caught this spreading illness . * sighs deeply * I am worried that it might be an old virus coming back . 
Why does my mother have to be so nosy ? 
I LOVE BEING AMERICAN ! F**K YEAH ! * hic * 
Dammit ! I never thought a patient would ask me to do something that drastic . 
I didn't mean for any of this to happen . 
I-I never asked for this . W-why did it have to happen ? 
Remembering September 29th . -sighs deeply- Walking home in the rain talking casually . It seems like only yesterday . 
I am so happy !! : ' D I can finally be with him ! I just have to explain everything to < PROPFIRST > now and that is going to be a hassle . 
Something tells me that today will be very interesting and dramatic . 
Okay Suri Demona needs to stop being a nosy and overprotective mother . < PROPFEMALE > Kokoro has A LOT of catching up to do . < PROPFIRST > De Sand needs to get on because I have TOO many things to tell him . Diethard Ried just needs to try to relax until I make a decision . 
My mom is amazed by my talent to sing in Italian . 
W-Why do I have to be such a bad person ......? I-I never asked for this ...... 
You can count on me like 1 2 3\ 
I'll be there\ 
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2\ 
And you'll be there\ 
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do , oh yeah\ 
Wooooh , Wooooh\ 
That's what friends are supposed to do , oh yeah\ 
You can count on me cause I can count on you 
He already knew my choice I guess . I am confident with my choice , but I have a pain now that will never go away ..... * tears fall * 
Anyone who wants to be my brother or sister can request it . : ) 
I wonder what would happen if I wore my Halloween costume to work ....

Th-There .... was an tornado ..... not many survived ..... I don't think .... I am going to ... -shielding < PROPFIRST > Cunningham from debris- 
-sighs- I am very excited , but I am a little sad . It has been troubling me ever since he left ... I hope he is alright . < PROPFIRST > De Sand ..... I do miss you and I hope all is well . I wish you luck and love . 
I-I can't take this pain ...... good-bye .... I am going away ... forever ..... I am going to find a new life .... -packs bags and flies to < PROPFEMALE > - 
I swear to God Spidey Noir when I get my hands on you for what you have done ..... 
\Just live your life .... Forget about me . You'll only hurt me more ... \ " Little Guy's words running through my head ... I know he is right .... I don't want him to die for my peace though ... I have created a mess and I don't know how to fix it ..... " 
-is passed out in a garden full of roses .... in < PROPFEMALE > - 
-in a lot of pain- D- Diethard Ried ...... Wh-Where are you ? 
I think my mom , Suri Demona has a crush on < PROPFIRST > Cunningham . -smirks- 
Apollo Justice just gave me a great idea . My mom , Suri Demona should be < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Cunningham should be Spike Spiegel for Halloween ! 
Diethard Ried ..... I am pregnant ~ ! 
D- Diethard Ried died .... in an explosion .... h-he .... never got to meet .... his two boys on the way .... 
Yay ~ ! I had my twins today . This is a great/horrible day , but I'm happy nonetheless . Diethard passed away , but I gained 2 great childeren !

Damn you Roozu Kimmy < PROPFEMALE > ! I hope you burn in the deepest depths of hell ! 
Dammit .... I failed . Roozu Kimmy < PROPFEMALE > will pay for her doings .
