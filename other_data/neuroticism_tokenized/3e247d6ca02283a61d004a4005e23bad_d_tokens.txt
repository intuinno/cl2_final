Dear Mr. Miller , I should not have to find 10 fallacies on the internet for the following reasons :\ 
\ 
You are a liberal teacher . \ 
My dad is a state senator ! \ 
You're a very smart man . \ 
Traditionally , AP Euro classes don't find 10 fallacies . \ 
Either I don't find 10 fallacies or Hitler comes back from the dead . You don't want Hitler alive do you ? \ 
Find 10 fallacies ? Why , soon we'll be finding 10 thousand fallacies !
