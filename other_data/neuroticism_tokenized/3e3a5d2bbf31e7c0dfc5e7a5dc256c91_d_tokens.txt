In my opinion , an autocratic system of coercion soon degenerates ; force attracts men of low morality ... The really valuable thing in the pageant of human life seems to me not the political state , but the creative , sentient individual , the personality ; it alone creates the < PROPMALE > and the sublime , while the herd as such remains dull in thought and dull in feeling . - < PROPFIRST > Einstein
