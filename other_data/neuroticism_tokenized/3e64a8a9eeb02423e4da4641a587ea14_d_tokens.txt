From now on , posting the name and artist of a song that describes how I'm feeling rather than saying it . :) I believe this will work because there is quite nearly a song for EVERYTHING !!!!

Hungry ... 
IT IS DONE !!!!!!! Gonna play my keyboard now . :) 
IT IS DONE ! My room IS CLEAN ! Not only is it clean , ( FINALLY ) but it has also seen a dramatic decrease in the ammount of CRAP within it . That's right . These last few weeks was like a clearance sale . 18 bags later , I am left with a cleaner , and more organized room . I feel fantastic . NEXT OBSTACLE ! : finding the courage to mess up my perfectly made , perfectly clean bed . 
Barnett WAS going to come over to my house today . Only problem is I'm not convinced he remembers where I live ...

Finally finished my rough version of my building draft . Feeling awesome , I glanced at the clock and was like , \OH MAH GAWD !! It's really 3 in the morning ? \"" 
Thank you Corporate < PROPFEMALE > for allowing me to wear a pantsuit . 
Not sure what I'm more upset about . This dress fiasco , or the fact that I ITCH !! WHYYYYY DOO I ITCHHH !!!!!!! * Cries and scratches !!!!! 
bad news : I may have a food allergy . \ 
better news : i'm not DEATHLY allergic , so finding out what EXACTLY I'm allergic to is not a super high priority . 
Gearing up for babysitting tonight . 
Picnic in a few hours . :) gonna be totally dead . Babysitting went well . 
Tumor . Yep . Oh well . Gonna get surgery . 
Sooooo nervous for my state board nursing exam . 
Got stopped by the police the other day . ( we were on foot ) He asked for ID and while I dug through my purse he leaned into his car and turned on his blue lights . ( this after a good 5 < PROPFEMALE > after he stopped us . ) I heard my brother whisper beside me , \well that's just unnessessary ... \ " lol ! " 
I don't know how I should feel . I enjoy being single . But without actively looking for opportunity to be with someone , the opportunity comes up . Up till this time in my life I've given everyone a shot . But a recent string of bad relationships makes me wonder . 
Everyone please stay on the look out for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . Her mother called us maybe half an hour ago saying that she didn't make it to her destination .

There is a place somewhere where the ground is made of plastic bags , pom poms and school papers . There is always plenty of good things to drink , No fleas or ear mites , cheese-its are served all day long , and momma is in her bed ready to pet you and love on you . Here , you are allowed to pick at momma's fluffy blanket and Mr. Snuggles too without getting in trouble . And when you're here , you won't be sick anymore . 
Working full speed ahead . 
I spent a significant amount of time at home today for the first time in about a month , and I wanna go back to work .
