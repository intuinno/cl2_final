I've learned that people are always changing . nothing will ever be the same and it sucks when people you know , become people you knew , when you can walk right past someone like they were never a big part of your life , how you used to be able to talk for hours and now how you can barley even look at them . but people change , and friends leave , but some people will always be there for you and life never stops for anyone 
Happy Chinese New Years everyone !!! chuc mung < PROPFEMALE > moi , gong hei phat choi :D 
biggest fear : failure :] 
I find its hard not to look back . Sometimes the past holds everything you've ever wanted , and it causes pain knowing you don't have it anymore .

Believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so that you can appreciate them when they are right , and sometimes good things fall apart so that better things can fall together ;D
