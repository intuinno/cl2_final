Someone tell me how much the Music Man is .

I See Stars was fucking awesome ! 
Ears are still ringing from I See Stars last night . <_<

New Attack Attack ! song whoo ! 
July 15th everyone , Warped Tour 2010 =) 
Staying at the AG allnighter tonight . Gonna rip shit up on the DDR machine . =D 
Waste of a weekend . At least school is almost over . I also realized Dance < PROPMALE > Dance is fucking awesome . 
Attack Attack!'s new album comes out tomorrow ! I'll be getting it right after school . =D 
Got the new Attack Attack ! CD and it's pretty awesome =D 
Does anyone know how to \unlink\ " two connections without having to call the network provider ? " 
You should know by now youre my heart , my soul . You're where I start and where Ill go cause weve been through worse than this . Yeah Ill be gone for a minute but dont forget all the Saturday nights , gathering inside the attic tight . We didnt know what we were doing but you said wed be alright . Butterflies , my hands were shaking . Better love that we were making . Take a breath , let it out , Another night , another doubt . 
I just took a nap and I had the same dream as yesterdays . I was on vacation at someone's house , some guy was pissing me off , and my dad was < PROPMALE > Hill xD 
Tearing up the DDR machine today =) 
lol there's underwater in Bikini Bottom xD 
I don't think I deserve it , selflessness . Find your way into my heart . All stars could be brighter . All hearts could be warmer . 
Last day of finals tomorrow . I'm going to completely fail my Adv . Chem final <_< 
Summer is finally here ! Going out to AG to play some dancing games later =) 
No offense , but Americans suck at cutting hair xD 
Why is it that when a guy tells a girl they have a nice ass or nice boobs we get slapped in the face ? If a girl told me I had a nice < PROPMALE > I would take it as a compliment . 
I'm not afraid , I loved something once . Are we fighting for something ? We can't save them all . I can't believe we let this one go . 
Sorry , You're Not A Winner 
It's almost 5 in the morning and people are still up . Wtf people go to sleep . 
I hate it when I tell a woman to make me a sandwich but then they say \sure\ " or \ " okay\ " . It just ruins the joke . I also hate reality tv shows . Why would I want to watch the lives of other people ? It's just stupid and pointless . " 
Bioshock is one fucked up game .... Someone wanna explain to me what happened in Rapture ? 
So I went to the Eastern Buffet today and as I was walking to the door , I see a group of people standing around a car and a guy was holding a wire trying to get into it . It looked like he was trying to hijack it lol . A waiter was at the door watching them xD 
< PROPMALE > of Prussia Mall with < PROPFEMALE > today =) 
Home from < PROPMALE > of Prussia . Bought an I See Stars and Bullet For My < PROPFIRST > shirt =) Out for dinner for Father's Day in a bit . 
Apparently < PROPFIRST > Cintron went into a coma and his heart is almost flatline . If you were close to him or at least knew him , please pray for him . I've been his friend for six years now and this is just unbearable =/ 
< PROPFIRST > Cintron's heart has stopped ..... the doctors are doing what they can . Please pray for his safe return =/ 
For those of you who care or want to know , here's what's been going on . < PROPFIRST > Cintron is in a coma and no one knows what the cause is . A few minutes ago , his heart randomly stopped . The doctors are doing what they can right now . They won't let his brother back in at the moment so we don't know what's going on . 
< PROPFIRST > is now out of his coma ! He's alright everybody =) 
For a kids ' show < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > is very violent . 
It's storming and I'm going swimming =D 
Well today just sucks 
< PROPFIRST > Odzana sucks at giving directions . 
Isnt it funny how some sort of poop just happens to land in our hallway and it just smells like absolute shit while we're trying to get stuff out of our lockers and we have to endure it for like 2 or 3 minutes ? Remember Mensky too ? HA what a joke xD 
I fucked a mermaid ^_^ 
Philly tonight , Dorney Park tomorrow ^_^ <3 < PROPFEMALE > 
This is where you die . 
Warped Tour next week ! Someone buy my ticket for me ? xD 
It's fun swimming in cold ass rain . 
Got my Warped Tour ticket ! Can't wait for it next week ! Who's going ? =] 
Why you will NEVER crack your knuckles again : http://bit.ly/bS329R 
I feel like absolute shit and Warped Tour is in a couple days . Hopefully I'll be better by then . Rainy says I need Wonton soup .... luckily I'm Asian ^_^ 
Warped Tour tomorrow ! It's gonna be fucking brutal ! =] 
Well Warped Tour was pretty fun but I missed most of the bands I wanted to see . It was kinda funny meeting up with Mr. Bachak there and I'm in the paper ! You can see the back of my head in the picture xD 
Fiddlesticks is the fucking man ! =] 
If anyone saw Enter Shikari at Warped Tour , did they play Solidarity ? 
Drinking the moisture from the air , \ 
\ 
I am so dry ... Let me get a sip of what you , \ 
Want me to say ! I am so thirsty ! 
For anyone who plays LoL , I need suggestions on what champion to buy next . I was thinking about Pantheon , Warwick , Teemo , or saving up for Kennen . I'm open for other champion suggestions . 
You're all I want and more =] 
Would anyone like to buy an $18 gift card for Viewmont Mall for $10 ? Provided by < PROPFIRST > Patterson . 
Awesome day until my mother decided to be a prick . 
Don't you hate it when your winning a game of LoL by a longshot and then your team decides to suck and the opposing team ends up winning the game ? I had 18 kills with Twitch and the next highest on my team was 7 with < PROPFEMALE > . Just utter disappointment . Also , Xin still needs a netf . 
Who's ready for TDWP's new album ? =D 
I just realized next week is the last week until school =/ 
Only the cool kids play the old Pokemon Red . My Charmander evolved a couple hours ago =] 
I just got the ability to fly , but my Charizard can't learn it . Wtf is up with that shit !? He has wings and he's big enough to < PROPFEMALE > my fat ass , compared to Pidgeotto who can learn it . xD 
Starting tomorrow it seems I wont have any connection for a couple days . If anyone needs me , I'll have my phone . 
Finally have my connection back ! Tired as all hell right now <_< 
Time to stay up late on a school night studying The Great Gatsby on Spark Notes WHOO ! 
Okay , so I just finished reading all or most of The Great Gatsby on Spark Notes . I am so ready to fail that test on Wednesday or whenever it is xD 
If you love Asking < PROPFEMALE > , Stand Up and Scream and pray their new album comes soon =] 
I swear my neighbor is so racist . Is it a coincidence that they put up the American flag in their yard and yet no one else in the neighborhood did ? I walked out of my house earlier and as I was their garage door opened . As soon as I unlocked my car ( which makes a beeping noise when I do ) they started to close the garage door mid opening . They don't like Asians . 
I just played a game of LoL where 3 of my teammates didn't even get one kill , the fourth got 2 kills , and I got 16 kills ( Twitch ) . Gotta love getting shitty teams . 
I know it's late , but if anyone is still planning on driving out be careful . The cops are on a rampage today . I saw like 5 or 6 people pulled over while I was out from Scranton to Dickson . 
Time to tear up the DDR machine at the AG allnighter =] 
AG allnighter was alright . Fucking Mr. < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > broke the right pad xD Well , wasnt all his fault . DDR machine did get torn up though . I'm so pro ^^ RIP , we'll never forget you 
Pray to the heavens \ 
With whatever it takes \ 
I wish to shine this light back upon you \ 
It's obvious that apocalyptic barriers \ 
( Will give ) no mercy to fashion \ 
You've compromised your doctrines \ 
You've surrendered yourself now ... \ 
Number Three , Never Forget 
1 in the morning , lying in bed , not even tired , having frequent cough spasms , get ready for school in about 4 and a half hours .... FML 
Alright , so now it's two in the morning and I'm still awake . At least my cough spasms have stopped . I just have to get ready for school in less than four hours ... hopefully I can get SOME sleep in . 
Release date of Cataclysm December 7 ! Whoo ! 
6/0/2 Garen , 25min 5v5 , 3 rage quits ..... SUNFIRE CAPES + DEMACIA ! =D 
< PROPFIRST > Moss traded to Vikings !? O.o 
< PROPMALE>'s Pizza with < PROPFIRST > Wahl , < PROPFIRST > Patterson , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Comes =] 
People keep hitting my fucking car ! I just found a fucking dent the size of a fucking rock . 
For anyone that plays WoW or used to play it , make sure you download the BIG Cataclysm patch that came out today . Even if you quit , install it anyway in case you come back and dont have to wait =] 
Starting tomorrow morning I get to shove medicine up my asshole two times a day ! I'm so excited ! 
When this is over we're all getting older now and we all play a part in it . Innocence is falling . Can you hear them calling now ? But I'll be by your side until the end . 
Won my first ranked game as Twitch 9/2/6 
I have just come to the conclusion that Asians are the best dancers in the world whether it's dubstep , freestyle , or just regular club dancing . 
Happy Poke An Asian Day tomorrow I guess ? xD 
I just realized that when people think about the old cartoons we used to watch like Cat-Dog , < PROPFIRST > Bravo , Ren & Stimpy , Ah ! Real Monsters , Rugrats , Hey < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , etc . no one ever mentions Invader Zim . Was that show too emo for some people or something ? In my opinion it was a really good show . 
I passed my first 7min song today with a 77.97% and I completely destroyed < PROPMALE > Patterson who got like a 70% ^_^ On another note , I'm fucking sick of my parent's bullshit <_< 
On my home from school , I get to the bottom of the hill and the road is completely closed . No way of slipping through . I end up having to take a half hour detour just to get home when it usually takes about 10min . I saw no problem with that road . Fuck Jermyn <_< 
So I think the road block is going to be there in the morning . Does anyone know the fastest way to get to school from Jermyn ? 
I just got a message/reminder on my iPod that used to belong to my sister and it said \Get a job - Tomorrow at 12:00 am - Anywhere that hires asians\ " I was like wow .... way to slap me in the face telling me to get a life . " 
Just stand up and scream , the tainted clock is counting down . You gave in to me , would you say the nights are far too long now ? 
If Mickeys a mouse and Minnies a mouse and Donalds a duck and < PROPFEMALE > and Goofy if they're all animals and they can talk ...... WHY IS PLUTO JUST A FUCKING DOG !? 
I completely give up on precalculus .... I'm not Asian enough to be good at it <_< 
I think Rainy Pritchett , < PROPFEMALE > Tokash , and < PROPFEMALE > Short would be good lesbians together . 
Where are all the sour patch parents ? 
To all Seniors in Lakeland I think we should have a massive party in the parking lot after school on the last full day . I dont think I've ever heard of seen it happen before . 
My girlfriend literally cried tears when I said I had to go . I love her so much ^_^ 
Most likely accepted into McCann School of Business and Technology and I got a wicked ass pen =] 
Big DDR tournament at Adventure Games next Saturday ! All are welcome to compete for $5 or watch for $1 . There is a Beginner's bracket so even if you suck you'd play against other people who suck as well . Let me know if you want to join ! It's for cancer !

I lost the motivation to work on my damn research paper when I got home . Just gonna have to hammer it out tomorrow on the last day before it's due on Monday . 
Someone give me a reason as to why teenagers should be tried as adults for murder <_< 
Does anyone know what the hell the < PROPFEMALE>'s Challenge thing tomorrow is ? 
Finally finished my god damn paper . Now I need to spend hours looking for a book/journal source .... 
Being seniors do we still have to have a note to leave ? I really dont want to sit in the gym all day tomorrow . 
My life has officially gone to hell . Been a long time since I've had a depressing status . 
Just got my 5th lvl 80 on wow =] 
Pretty good night with everyone . No < PROPMALE > of going to AG tomorrow to play dancing games all night anymore though =/ 
Big Scholarship test today . Hopefully I'll be able to go to AG later to play some dancing games or at least do something for the 5th month anniversary =] 
I feel like absolute shit and I just want to sleep all day . 
Happy WoW's 6th anniversary ! Yay for being a nerd ^_^ Goodnight FB , shit school in the morning . 
WoW movie expected to come out in 2013 ? We'll be dead then <_< 
Cataclysm goes live in 2 hours and 50 minutes ! 
Cataclysm is live and I will most definitely be playing it all day after school ^^ 
Nightmare Before Christmas is on and Cataclysm is the shit =] 
My aunt once told me \slow and steady wins the race\ " ......... she died in a fire . " 
No more stacking Sunfire Capes lol 
This is the story of our lives\ 
From the road we sit and watch it pass by\ 
Is this the best use of my time ? \ 
Don't worry my love , everything's alright\ 
I'd give just about anything to know she's waiting for me\ 
An eye for an eye , a dream for a dream 
I have mastered the < PROPMALE > of Ezreal . I love myself . 
\Did he have to strip ? \".........\" Clearly he's insane \"" 
LMAO < PROPFEMALE > Kochis is the new champion coming out ! 
My car is a padiddle now xD 
Amazing Christmas < PROPFEMALE > with my girlfriend and I got everything that I wanted , especially Death Metal Unicorn Attack for my iPod ^^ 
Up at 4 in the morning playing LoL with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Patterson . Doesnt get any better than that . Maybe not on Christmas but it's a start . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody ! 
AG New Years Allnighter tonight ! Cant wait to play some DDR again . See you all next year ^_^ and Rammus is fucking awesome 
Everyone pray for the first snow day of this school year . For every person that does not pray before you go to bed a small kitten will die . < PROPMALE > Evans would not like that he will be run you over with his car .
