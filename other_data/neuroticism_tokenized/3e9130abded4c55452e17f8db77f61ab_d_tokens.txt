Linden McEachern ... I just heard ' do it on the stove ' on tv . And I laughed . It's war now ! xD

It is too early and I look like death . I can't wait to get back home and take a nap . 
Nothing like a good movie to knock me out for the night . The Hangover .

It's like a mosh pit for teeth in my mouth . 
This crap about violent video games corrupting our youth is bull . Teach your kid self control , morals , and living a balanced life and video games won't harm anyone or anything . Ah yes , parenting is the problem . 
< PROPFEMALE > Horgrow where did you go ?!? come back ... it didn't mean anything ! lmao 
Don't just take a chill pill ... take the whole damn bottle . Some people ... augh . > <

Mmmmm good start to the day . The man DID buy me that coach . I love it ! However ... work at 6 am tomorrow . Not lookin forward to that . =[ 
Holy shit Im awake this early and in a speedway bigger than my house . =O 
Busy day . School from 11-2 . Work from 3-10 . Im gonna be comatose when i get home xD 
Today was ... just strange . No other way to put it . 
Sec of state = fail . I havent heard a number called in 10 minutes . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s for dinner . <3 
“Never assume the obvious is true . ” 
I told people to get gas . The district manager calls and says its going up 10 cents . Im psychic :D 
First weekend off in awhile , mid winter break next week , should be getting my vehicle soon ... life is good . :D 
Well i guess if i have to work on my day off , having steak brought to me is pretty cool =] 
B-dubs ! <3 
All i can say after work is ... Sometimes we cant help or understand someone if they dont want to be helped or understood . 
Getting my car in the a.m. with my kickass aunt . Cant wait ! :D 
\ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?! \ " -<PROPFIRST>'s response when I asked him to < PROPFEMALE > me to the couch . =] " 
Somebody crawled out of hells ass today ... 
About to rip my dash/door panels out to put some new boom-booms in w/ the siski Ally Pardo 
Work from 5-10 . Yet ... Its a quarter after 1 . Wtf ? If i ever do this again there better be a damn good reason or ill rip someones soul out . 
$5 lotto ticket turns into a $105 lotto ticket . Priceless . :D 
New stereo was a success . Only got electrocuted once . =] Work 4-11 . 
Stop raining/snowing , be summer . :) 
So ive decided ... I want a motorcycle :D 
This classroom smells like a nursing home . 
\Cant is the cancer of happen\ " - < PROPFIRST > shien Wtf ?! Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > dear :D " 
Walk your talk if you want respect in life . 
I got to write my first incident report today . My own . Thank god i shaved my legs because i just blew my knee out =[ 
This blows . Nevermind the fact that I blew my knee out because I REACHED for something but these crutches are giving me blisters . I'm so fat . 
The dude sitting next to me is listening to really loud jazz on his phone . Its about 80 degrees in here and Im at the back of the line . Gotta love sec of state . 
I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones that will . Think of someone you know or love who has or had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour ? Do it for all who have fought and are fighting . 
Twas a nice day off . Relaxing . No line at sec of state followed by an amazing night with < PROPFIRST > Short =] 
Lmao every status is about hating snow and wanting to move . In a few months , well all be having heat strokes and bitching about the humidity . Michigan ftw 
watched a video in class today of a state trooper getting shot . we then watched him die on camera . normally that stuff doesn't get to me . this video did- i'm going into WHAT field ? =P 
Didn't even realize it was 4-20 . Got work tomorrow , gonna be more idiots than usual in there . Blah . 
I left the house today without my license . Thank God I went back for it because hours later , I got pulled over . :( 
Gotta love insomnia . Got too much on my mind right now . Cant wait to find some sort of balance again . 
One week to go and it's summer ! Tomorrows the last day I have to get up at 6 a.m. =] 
\Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls ; the most massive characters are seared with scars . \"" 
One more class and Im done with my first year of college . =] 
Happy mothers day ! Special thanks to my mom for being all that she is . I love you mommy :D 
It's amazing outside . Time to become a lobster ! 
So I gardened yesterday . I now have a sunburn and ... IT FEELS GREAT ! >:D 
what to do , what to do .... Benn Rama or < PROPFIRST > Smith ... MAKE ME A SAMMICH AND BRING IT TO ME ! <3 < PROPFIRST > Johns 
One day Im gonna ball up a customers money . And eat it . Just to see their reaction . What now . People man , people > < 
* sigh * 6am . Its unnatural for me to be awake at this hour . Hopefully no money eating impulses today . 
Just had a girls night with the beloved Ally Pardo . Ended up getting a new fish today , let's see how long this lasts before I accidentally destroy him . :( 
3-10 today . Brians coming home tonight finally :D 
I got hustled for the first time today . Pretty bad . FML and F people . 
Yessss . Going to die tomorrow . Living in hell isn't good enough HA . Love everybody and good night xD 
They caught our x-mas day robber . Everyone got subpoenaed but me . Because I wasn't paying any attention at the time =[ 
So im sitting at the light , corner of platt and < PROPMALE > and 2 deer walk across the crosswalk . Just chillen . Odd . 
I , a blue eyed blond , just got profiled aka spotlighted aka BLINDED by a cop driving by . I think the stereo casts a texting-while-driving like glare on my face or .... Its cuz im blond . Awkward . 
I believe I've acquired a Rock Band 3 injury . BECAUSE I'M BEAST ! 
Rockband : Night 2 . Oh ! And I haven't killed the catfish though he introduced Ich and got both fish infected =\\ 
Nothing like coming home to a dead fish . Taking the body back to petco for refund . Watch me forget the dead fish in a bag is with me and leave it in the car .... In the heat . While at Work .... Lmao disgusting . 
That was the most pathetic storm ever . I was more afraid of the customers pounding on the door , cussing at us and doing donuts in the parking lot because we have to close when Theres a TORNADO WARNING ! 
I push my fingers in to my eyes .... Sitting in the car melting because they wont let me clock in early . Dogs die in hot cars . I am a dog =] 
Had an amazing day off with my siski . I so needed this day off before i lost it ( completely ) :D 
People cant drive today . More than usual . 
Enjoyed my first day off . Went fishing with Ally Pardo and then chilled at home with the man . Plans for tomorrow ? To do absolutely nothing . :) 
Blah . Back to work tomorrow . These next few days will be a rollercoaster but hopefully its for the best . * puts on war face 
So my car ... is part of a recall ... claiming that the gas tank is in the right position to explode if rear ended . LMAO i'm gonna burn up . not flip . fml . 
Nice day off . Got a lot of things done . Tomorrow I'm up at 5am ... fml . 
Augh . Cleaning my room > < 
Today , i got paid to sit on a milk carton outside and listen to someone talk , then i got inked again , < PROPMALE > Wif my best frannnd , followed by talking to a friend i havent talked to in forever . id say this day off was a success . :) 
Well then . Some guy walked around our store , back and forth , we were busy so he ... Went next door and robbed that store . I think today could have been worse . 
Awesome day out in tipton with the family . < PROPMALE > out in and around the pool and ate too much . Fireworks tonight :D 
These last 2 days have been the shit , i wish everyday had fireworks and double pay . :) 
People are gross . A guy sneezed in my eye today at work . :( 
I tried to register for intermediate algebra ... it said I didn't meet the criteria . On the upside , I finished registering ... minus math . :D 
Uneventful , lazy 3 days off . Loved it . Back to work tomorrow , money is money . 
Today , they started tearing our roof off . At 8am . FML . 
4 days off of work . What to do ... What to do . I know ! Absolutely nothing =] 
Aughhhh . Thought I had everything ready to go for school . Looks like I don't . Have to go up there tomorrow and hopefully sort it out or ... not go to school this year . =[ 
Great burden off my shoulders . Im going to school this year ! In the meantime , i plan to relax and enjoy these next 2 days off :P 
Today was swell . Went to Pinball < PROPMALE>'s with the man and walked around downtown for about 6 hours . Granted , it would have been better if the < PROPMALE > Fair was in action but ... I'll settle . Happy to be home , my feet hurt :) 
Hell yeah ! I sold 100 < PROPFEMALE > bars in 2 days . This means ... I get to write my own schedule for a week ! :D 
Worked a slow 2-10 followed by glow bowling with Ally Pardo , < PROPMALE > Cooper , and < PROPFIRST > Short . A successful evening . Even if I can't bowl . =] 
My poor < PROPFEMALE > is at home dying and Im stuck here til 11 . < PROPFEMALE > in there Lil guy =[ 
Intense night . The amazing Dilla Cakes will see another day and this storm is ... so cool . To say the least . 
Im ready for it to stop raining :D 
I wasnt designed to be awake at this hour . 
Blah . Woke up with a sore throat , throbbing head , chills and a body that felt like it had been hit by a freight train . Maybe a good nights sleep will help . Moral of the story ? < PROPFIRST > has cooties :D 
it's a miracle . i can breathe out of my nose . =] 
I love days of nothingness . :) 
What's green , has 4 legs , and would kill you if it fell out of a tree and landed on you ? A pool table .... LMAO :D 
Freakonomics . Interesting stuff . 
The planet of the apes = epic . 
This is the most boring day at work that Ive ever had . Cant wait to go home and xbox it up . Or anything actually . 
I could get called into work at any time for the next week , but i havent been . Trying to relax and enjoy this time off ... Rather than feel like im unemployed . =[ 
Awesome day with awesome people , and then i remember i have to get up for work in 4 hours . Not so awesome . :( 
So today a customer comes in and his zipper was down . Normally not a big deal ... Except that he was going commando and his balls were hanging out . Scarred for life . =] 
Two years ago today , < PROPFIRST > asked me to be his . Two of the best years of my life . Happy anniversary < PROPFIRST > ! :D 
Had an amazing evening with the greatest man . Final destination 5 was probably the best one of the series and ... No work this weekend ! Things are good right now :) 
Hellz yeah , I did 20 situps and cannot breathe . I think I might've pulled a fat roll . :D 
Back at my store . Absolutely nothing to do . 2-11 alone and 13 minutes in i already broke my register . Yus . 
Another long and lonely shift with nothing to do . :( 
Cant believe school starts tomorrow ! Its actually exciting .... No more solo 8 hour shifts staring at plywood . Yeehaw . 
First day of school down ! Now I get a day off to recover and ... do homework . :P 
Can't stop the hurt inside , when love and hate collide . 
So now there's some old guy showing off his junk outside of Huron . 3 times so far . Glad to be class of 2010 ! 
Holy shit Michigan ! I pee'd myself a little at the end =S 
Wow . Some chick followed me after class so that she could get my parking spot . I couldn't find my car . Aha ! Found it . Won't unlock . Then the alarm goes off . Wasn't my car so I shrug at her and ... wander away . She stopped following me lmao 
I got to work at 4pm , Im leaving at 6 am . Oh Fuck my life and my managers that wont answer their phones . 
What happens when a spider lands on my face while driving ? I slam on the brakes , jump out , and go absolutely nuts . at least i wasnt on the highway . Did i mention i HATE spiders ?? Now i feel phantom spiders on me =[ 
If you have to tell people you're in charge , that you're superior , you're not . You're self-righteous , a wannabe . It's so much easier to get people to do as they're told by being respectable . Lead by example . 
18 years and 364 days ago , my mom shat me out . Bout to be a kickass day ! :D 
I feel old , yet wise . :) Gonna be a fun night , with awesome people ! 
Last night ... was a success . Minus losing my phone . Spent time with some awesome people . Thanks to Ally Pardo , Brian Short , and < PROPMALE > Cooper ! :D 
Today's been decent . Other than going through the carwash with the sun roof open :( 
Chevelle concert was a success ! 
Crazy last few days . When the smoke cleared , I was the only one left standing . Success . I love it when things work out ! Now I think I have an ulcer . :) 
The guy that plays < PROPMALE>'s voice is a giant , Mike-Tyson-looking black guy :D 
I almost ran over a bumble < PROPFEMALE > in my neighborhood . That could have < PROPFEMALE > n tragic . 
Yesterday was terrible , it can kiss my ass . I haven't been that upset in awhile . :( On the up hand ... I get to sleep in an extra hour ! Extra coma time hellll yeah ! 
Modern Warfare 3 ! SO PUMPED ! 
So ... Little girls that I've kidnapped and tortured .... taste like chicken noodle soup . Maybe it's good I don't remember my dreams ?! 
Seriously ... censoring the internet . This isn't fucking < PROPFEMALE > , the Government blocking a site ( like Facebook ) because a user spams a link to a another site ... I understand piracy is bad but to hold a hosting site 100% for . every . fucking . word . a user types ? I'm terrified =\\ 
Heck yeah . Feels good to have a cellular device again :D 
lmfao Occupy < PROPFEMALE > Arbor . Go to New York , where the problem is . Next week we'll be reading about them raping each other or OD'ing in their tents .
