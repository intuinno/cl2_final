Well , as the stack of make-up work thins , as does my < PROPFEMALE > for doing it ....

Thanks to everyone who helped me out today . It's very much appreciated . =) 
Thanks < PROPFIRST > for the < PROPMALE > Potter Wand replica . And thanks to my friends in Band for being just plain awesome . \\nNate 
just found out a company I'm very interested in had its board replaced by bank investors . All because the people who knew what they were doing , and doing a great job of it , didn't want to do it anymore . They're now holding other jobs in the company now .

Why am I still up at 11:18 and listening to Chicago with their amazing , blaring horn section ? Because they're the best band ever ? Yes indeedy !

Lesson I've learned over the past couple of days : Windows wants to be the only operating system on my computer , and I've tried every single workaround I can find to install Linux , but they've all failed . 
Rule 36 of the Internet : There will always be more messed up crap than what you just saw . \ 
Rule 18 :\ 
Everything that can be labeled can be hated .

Rules of The Internet :\ 
107 ) \That's what she said\ " jokes are stupid . No Exceptions " 
Godwin's Law : This rule of internet behaviour states that , the longer a conversation within a forum , chat room , or any other form of communication over the internet persists , the more likely a reference to Nazis or Hitler is to appear . If the reference occurs during an argument or flame war , the side who brings up the reference loses the argument . 
After seeing some hilarious trolling on the internet as of late , I fear I may run out of laughter soon . 
Gonna be watching the all day Doctor Who Marathon on BBC that started just now . 
Of course ... I'm halfway through the new episode of Doctor Who and thick clouds knock out my satellite TV .... 
Today is an exceptionally nice day . 
If you run a computer on Windows 7 , do the following :\

Downloading a few episodes of Doctor Who on iTunes . 
Took apart my old desktop , put it back together and booted it up , no problems ... And then I opened it up just to get to the RAM . 
I don't understand why people get overly excited on the price is right .... The people on Who wants to be a millionaire have more potential cash to earn and they're usually nowhere near as excited . Lol 
This ... is ... Spartaaa ! \ 
.. No , this is < PROPFIRST > . 
Listening to < PROPMALE > Cook and his stand-up .... Lol

CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL . \ 
EVEN WITH CRUISE CONTROL , YOU STILL HAVE TO STEER . 
Got into a Political debate with a 13 year old for almost 2 hours . Not sure if I should be impressed by her ability to debate , or embarrassed because I debated with a 13 year old . Lol 
Good morning . 
Former First Lady < PROPFEMALE > Ford passed away yesterday . 
Well , I hate the new Facebook chat interface . It doesn't show everyone who's online . So , until it's changed , I think I'll stick to Live Messenger . ( You can connect it to Facebook and use Facebook chat through it . ) 
Hmmm ...... Hello ? Is this the Krusty Krab ? No ! This is < PROPFIRST > ! 
Holy copyright infringement , Batman !

Just got off of the phone with Frontier tech support ... I love knowing exactly what they're gonna suggest I do next and have it done before they even say anything , but I need the tools they have available on their end when the connection goes down . 
Watching Piers < PROPFIRST > on CNN ... < PROPFEMALE > Grace is on and I can't stand her ... Lol 
Just saw a commercial for a movie that might show Vampires some justice after the crap Twilight messed up ... Look up Fright Night . THAT is a vampire movie ! 
Watching the Blue Brothers on VH1 . One of my favorite movies . 
Toy Story 2 : My favorite out of all the Toy Stories

But < PROPFIRST > , the only thing I've seen you clean is your plate . 
Well , crap . World stock prices are crashing hard ... I foresee some very bad times ahead unless politicians get their acts together . If they don't , I may just become a Canadian citizen . they have one of the strongest economies in the world right now . 
Dow slid by 600 points earlier today , followed by a steep recovery , and it has recovered ~ 240 points after that huge slide . Panic on Wall Street ... The trading is just an irrational reaction . 
Ten minutes until the closing < PROPFEMALE > on Wall Street . Dow Jones Industrial average is down over 600 points , now . 
And at the closing < PROPFEMALE > on Wall Street , the Dow is down 632 points , 5.52% . Craziness ... 
REMINDER ! Brass and Percussion practice TONIGHT at 18:00 ( 6:00 PM ) 
Ooh , I love waking up to the Dow bouncing back over 200 points . Perhaps the stock market isn't doomed . Also , the downgrading of the U.S. credit rating didn't affect the areas it should have . It should not have affected the stock market . 
Union rights : The only way workers can stand up to big business and keep it in check .
