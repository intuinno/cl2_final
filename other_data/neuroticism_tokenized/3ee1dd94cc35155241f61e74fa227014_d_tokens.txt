So i get to work and there are 3 of these religious comic book things . one of which is titled \are < PROPMALE > catholics christians ? \ " the entire booklet trashes the religion saying how its a cult and the traditions are made up .... this crosses the line . if only i would have been here when they handed this out . " 
Someone crapped on the SIDE of the toilet at work . How does that happen ? ... actually ... nvm I don't wanna know =/ Sorry , i just thought I'd share that >_<

All of your ways and all your thunder , \ 
Got me in a haze running for cover , \ 
Where we gonna go from here .... 
Meet me in outerspace ... \ 
We could spend the night , \ 
Watch the Earth come up . \ 
I've grown tired of that place , \ 
Won't you come with me ? \ 
We could start again .... 
I can't believe my little brother is 16 years old !!! Time flies ... :( 
So , so you think you can tell \ 
Heaven from Hell , \ 
Blue skys from pain . \ 
Can you tell a green field \ 
From a cold steel rail ? \ 
A smile from a veil ? \ 
Do you think you can tell ? 
Actually had a customer today who thought he was < PROPMALE > . He even named his drink the \ < PROPMALE > Espresso White Lightnin ' Frappuccino\ " . Very interesting day . " 
It's only half past the point of no return\ 
The tip of the iceberg\ 
The sun before the burn\ 
The thunder before the lightning\ 
The breath before the phrase\ 
Have you ever felt this way ? 
You write such pretty words ... \ 
But life's no storybook .. 
All of your ways and all your thunder\ 
Got me in a haze running for cover\ 
Where we gonna go from here\ 
Where we gonna go from here ... 
Stones taught me to fly\ 
Love , it taught me to lie\ 
Life , it taught me to die\ 
So it's not hard to fall\ 
When you float like a cannonball 
Got my license ..... finally XD 
Why do people leave passive aggressive notes at work .... Then I get to hear about it on my day off . 
I used tingling tanning lotion ...... BAD idea . :*( 
Packing for my trip ! Spending the night in Atlanta and getting on a plane at 8am . Im so excited !

Never apologize , never explain . Aim to misbehave .

Dear Mister Fantasy play us a tune\ 
\ 
Something to make us all happy\ 
Do anything take us out of this gloom\ 
Sing a song , play guitar\ 
Make it snappy 
You make me smile like the sun\ 
Fall out of bed \ 
sing like bird\ 
Dizzy in my head \ 
spin like a record\ 
Crazy on a Sunday night\ 
You make me dance like a fool\ 
Forget how to breathe\ 
Shine like gold \ 
buzz like a bee\ 
Just the thought of you can drive me wild\ 
Ohh you make me smile 
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold . I'll be fine once I get it , I'll be good . 
describee me in ONE word ., using the FIRST letter of you're name . copy this into your status to see what people think of you (: 
So , i got lost in Auburn ... AGAIN ... and ended up in < PROPFEMALE > somehow . I need a GPS . 
Having a great Christmas , I love my family ! Mommy cooked a wonderful dinner and now everyone is playing with their new things =) I hope everyone is enjoying their Christmas as well ! 
It's SNOWING !!!! :D 
Why was everyone and their mother at Kroger today getting Starbucks ?.... And the majority of them left their manners at home . I guess since Christmas is over they can go back to being their douchey selves . Work is driving me banana sandwich . SOOOO Glad I'm off tomorrow :) 
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you ... 
What's everyone doing for New Years ?!! 
And though my edges may be rough , \ 
I never feel I'm quite enough . \ 
And it may not seem like very much , \ 
But I'm yours . 
Long night of Law and Order SVU and CSI , now its bedtime ! Work at 9:30 :( 
Velcro Pygmies were awesome ! I had a lot of fun =D 
AND THE PATRIOTS LOST !! WOOOT !!!! 
Anyone know of a place that's hiring ? ... Preferably a place that sucks less than Kroger .
