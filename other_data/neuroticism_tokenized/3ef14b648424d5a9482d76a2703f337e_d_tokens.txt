Spring Break is a wonderful thing ! 

Q : What do you call Catholic Tuna ? A : Chicken of the Holy See 
Misunderstood Clausewitz Quote of the Day : Let us not hear of Generals who conquer without bloodshed . If a bloody slaughter is a horrible sight , then that is a ground for paying more respect to War , but not for making the sword we wear blunter and blunter by degrees from feelings of humanity , until some one steps in with one that is sharp and lops off the arm from our body . 
Misunderstood Clausewitz Quote of the Day : We see , therefore , that War is not merely a political act , but also a real political instrument , a continuation of political commerce , a carrying out of the same by other means . All beyond this which is strictly peculiar to War relates merely to the peculiar nature of the means which it uses . 
More Joy of Clausewitz : [ War ] ... is also , as a whole ... a wonderful < PROPFEMALE > , composed of the original violencence of its elements , hatred and animosity , which may be looked upon as blind instinct ; of the play of probabilities and < PROPMALE > , which make it a free activity of the soul ; and of the subordinate nature of a political instrument , by which it belongs purely to the reason . 
Clausewitz Say : Truth alone is but a weak motive of action with men , and hence there is always a great difference between knowing and action , between science and < PROPMALE > . The man recieves the strongest impulse to action through the feelings , and the most powerful succour ... through those faculties of he < PROPMALE > and mind which we have considured under the terms of resolution , firmness , perseverance , and force of character . 
Rewatching it has confirmed my opinion : Dr. Zhivago is a really good movie 
Hey ! I just finished my Self-Organization in Science and Society project like 10 minutes ago ! YAY SLEEP DEPRIVATION !! 1 !! eleven ! Not that I mind ... this was an awesomely fun paper to write ... 
\Artillery Brings Dignity to What Would Otherwise Be Just A Vulgar Brawl \"" 
I just added some movies to my profile . For those in the know : ZERSTORER ! ALARM ! 
Wow , I graduated college ... that went quick ... 
So long Jimmy : La vie d'un grognard est passé , vive < PROPMALE > grognards ! 
Today I will be someone awesome :D 
back to normal . At the strike of 1 I revert from brilliant military theorist to unemployed physics BS 
Yay back to < PROPFIRST > for a few days 
So , who wants to talk about military logistics ? 
or Soviet grand strategy ? 
There are two supplements at the end of The Grand Strategy of the Soviet Union ; one on their military growth and the other on the nature of their economy . I am just finishing up the part on the economy and am finding it very interesting . It would have been interesting , if unlikely to the point of impossibility , if Gorbachev had attempted a limited liberalization of the Soviet economy along the lines of the NEP . 
Back to < PROPFIRST > on Thursday 
I too am a Demand Studios writer now ! 
I cannot strongly enough recommend < PROPMALE > Kahn's \Thinking the Unthinkable in the 1980's\ " as a palliative for the collection of preposterous myths which make up the popular view of nuclear warfare . " 
Back to < PROPFIRST > ! This time on a more permanent basis . 
Is anyone else as tired as I am of a political left that seems to think every war is Vietnam and a political right that seems to think every war is WWII ?

When < PROPFEMALE > woke up from her nap , I asked her how she felt . Her reply : \ ... tomato \"" 
Apparently a glitch ( possibly due to aging hardware ) caused an entire Minuteman field to go at least partially offline yesterday , over 50 ICBM's . 1 ) It is time for a hardware update . 2 ) A small part of me pines for MX . 3 ) the fact that 50 Minutemen is a whole 1/9 of our arsenal is ... unsettling . Even moreso that a glitch can take down a significant percentage of our deterrent in one stroke . 
Saw the scifi thriller \Pandorum\ " last night . < PROPFEMALE > and I were willing to forgive all it's flaws for this 10 second period near the end at which time it seemed they had pulled off an amazing inversion of many unfortunate scifi movie tropes and tied that inversion to a truly epic story . Then they turned it around and followed every single one of those tropes :( " 
Hmm ... thinking about starting a blog this weekend . 
\When bad ideas have nowhere to go they gravitate to American universities and become courses . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Wilde " 
Yay ! First blog post 
Happy Birthday USMC . Here's to the march on Tripoli , the storming of Chapultepec , bloody Belleau Wood , Guadalcanal , Iwo and every other damned rock in the Pacific , Chosin Reservoir and Inchon , Da Nang and Khe Sanh , Iraq and Afghanistan , and every battle yet to come ; to every drop of < PROPFEMALE > blood spilled on the dirt , sand , and ice of battlefields across the world over the last 235 years . 
In Flanders Fields the poppies blow\ 
Between the crosses row on row , \ 
That < PROPFIRST > our place ; and in the sky\

Scarce heard amid the guns below . 
I went into a public-'ouse to get a pint o ' beer , \ 
The publican ' e up an ' sez , \We serve no red-coats here . \ " \ 
Delicious pork roast is delicious ... lots of whole garlic cloves stuffed into slits in the meat , bay leaves , and onions too . om nom nom ^^ 
Anonymous friend sez : \I'm not a part of the gay pride movement ... that would require being way to anal . \ " ( she meant about terminology ) " 
Finally have a new post up on my blog . Sorry for the long delay , between a vacation in Chicago , then one at my house , then the holidays + moving to a new house things have been hectic . 
Just made ... the most amazing pork roast I've ever had . Garlic cloves and < PROPFEMALE > stuffed with an apple-butter/caramelized-garlic glaze . 
It matters very little who starts a revolution . What matters is who ends it . 
Am making cream of cabbage , mushroom , and potato soup . Due to the use of purple cabbage , < PROPFEMALE > and I now have a delicious and bright purple cream soup ... 
New post ( first in a series ): http://scipioamericanus.wordpress.com/ 
Made some cinnamon-brandy scones ... very good 
< PROPFEMALE > and I came up with these possible cat-names for the kitten we are getting one sleepless night :\ 
1 ) < PROPMALE > Meowsevelt\ 
2 ) < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Bismeow\ 
3 ) Hammeowabi\ 
4 ) Agamewnon\ 
5 ) Sun-Mew\ 
6 ) Meowser ( after our fave rifle)\ 
... There were some more but I can't remember them at the moment ... 
< PROPFEMALE > and I just had an awesome viking feast : rough-cut potatoes with the skins on , large juicy rare steaks , and hot mead drunk out of horns ! I find myself filled with the urge to raid an < PROPFEMALE > monastery .
