So , this is the great \face-book\ " everyone's been talking about ... This better be good . " 

I was just changing out some litterboxes and in the process , I opened a new bag of < PROPFEMALE > litter . And as I poured this litter into the box , a little scrap of paper fell through with it ! The words FREQUENT BUYER COUPON were printed across the top , and the paper informed me that if I gathered 11 other papers like it , I could \mail them in\ " for a FREE BAG OF LITTER . My glee is akin to finding a toy in one's cereal box . " 
Just came back from the big ROE prerelease . There were supposed do be around 30 people . ... There were 4 . 
just saw a commercial for a job website in which a hunting safari group was following a herd of wheely armchairs across the Savanah before shooting one and reining it in . The words DO NOT ATTEMPT were printed on the screen . If I see a herd of wheely armchairs charging across the plains any time soon , I'm gonna ATTEMPT . 
just saw another commercial- this time , with astronauts riding a rover across one of Saturn's moons . And guess what I saw ? DO NOT ATTEMPT . What's with this trend of weird commercials warning viewers not to attempt things they could never possibly do ? 
The blood of every locked door that's ever lived runs through my veins . 
just saw the Sly Fox premiere , and lemme tell you , it's awesome . Funny as hell , and the plot is twisted . NOW EVERYONE ELSE GO SEE IT . 
is wondering if Senior Fun Day is actually going to be interesting , or will be just like those end-of-the-year fun days in Elementary School where you played random games with bean bags the teachers had made up the previous evening . Any former West students wanna confirm or deny ?

I will trust my senses or surrender to a reflex . I will trust my instincts or surrender to my pride .

If you only accept one thing I say in my life as true and sincere , let it be this . \ 
Little Big Planet 2 is awesome . 
So I saw the movie Stargate the other night . As far as hard sci-fi is concerned , it had the consistency of runny cake batter . But as far as speculative sci-fi is concerned , it was friggin ' awesome . Does anyone know if SG-1 is any good ? 
Vittoria algi Assassini ! 
Today is the anniversary of V-Day . May we never forget . 
I'm sitting in my living room holding a glass of orange juice . It's my third glass today . There are small restaurants and bars that purchase and expend less orange juice than this residence . \ 
When did I and everyone in my family become orange juice junkies ? We used to be normal . But I look back on our lives and I can't see the turning point . \
