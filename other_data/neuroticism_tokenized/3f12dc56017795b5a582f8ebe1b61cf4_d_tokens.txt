All together , walk alone against all we've ever known All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home But you take all we are ; the innocence of our hearts Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart 
And we hide behind , Lies , anger , Hate they shoo love away , Build shells of ourselves outside , It shelters body from cold reigns of reality , 
Hear us whisper in the dark , in the rain you see the spark Feel the beating of our hearts , fleeting hope as we depart All together , walk alone against all we've ever known All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home But you take all we are ; the innocence of our hearts Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart 
WATCHING TRANSFORMERS 2 =D

into the bottom of a bottle\ 
that is empty and bare\ 
all my desolate soul\ 
in my desolate home\ 
it´s my desolate role\ 
yeah I´m here all alone\ 
I can´t think of a reason\ 
to get the f**k out of bed\ 
curtains closed , lights are off\ 
Am I alive or dead ? \ 
I haven´t shaved in a week\ 
I always slur when I speak\ 
tolerance at it´s peak\

But if you only have love for your own race\ 
Then you only leave space to discriminate\ 
And to discriminate only generates hate\ 
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate 
Five Finger Death Punch - The Devil's Own\ 
Where did I go wrong ? Who was I supposed to be ? \

**** ing magnets , how do they work ?

There are no unlockable doors\ 
There are no unwinnable wars\ 
There are now unrightable wrongs or unsingable songs\ 
There are no unbeatable odds\ 
There are no believable Gods\ 
There re no unnameable names , \ 
Shall I say it again ? Yeah\ 
There are no impossible dreams\ 
There are no invisible seams\ 
Each night when the day is through , \ 
I don't ask much\

i hate how people can't handle the truth . 
Sinister souls errupt\ 
Bound deconstruct\ 
All the aspects of what life costs\ 
Turn this warm heart to frost\ 
There's no signs of a time to stop ... I'm lost\ 
Crawling deeper into the pit\ 
This abyss will swallow you quick\ 
Stand strong , fierce to the wind\ 
Fall down ... face to the ground 
You are a child of the universe , no less than the trees and the stars ; you have a right to be here . And whether or not it is clear to you , no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should . Therefore be at peace with god , whatever you conceive him to be and whatever your labors and aspirations , in the noisy confusion of life , keep peace in your soul . 
I make the right moves but I'm lost within\ 
I put on my daily façade but then\ 
I just end up getting hurt again\ 
By myself 
i love being a nerd sometimes :) 
As death lingers\ 
Soulless we march on\ 
It calls our name to the sun\ 
Our fate burns at dawn\ 
Heartless we < PROPFEMALE > on 
Coughing , sneezing , running nose , can't breathe . I think today's gonna be a terrible day . 
inbox me ; and tell me something you have always wanted to tell . it'll stay between you and i only . then set this as your status , and see what you get . 
It's not that complicated and you ain't gotta believe\ 
They'll put me down in a hole before I let you succeed\ 
I've never been complacent , I can't afford to be\ 
I know you think you're special but you ain't nothin ' 
Brotoss ftw 
So much stress . finding it hard to deal with it all :( 
The doctors say my Uncle < PROPMALE > has no brain activity :( 
Has anyone ever played Runes of Magic ? Is it any good ?
