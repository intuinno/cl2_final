i was bending down over my cat , petting her , when i noticed something odd . her sides were expanding and contracting every ten seconds or so . when i put my ear to her , i found that she was hiccuping . it's the first time i had ever examined an animal to portray bodily functions that would otherwise have been thought to be human 
My mother started calling me a different name . What does that mean ?

i love it when you are mentioned at public events , although you did nothing . My sister's essay was being read for njhs when it mentioned me . Why couldn't she have said my name was darquavius , marvolo , or barack ? notice all three are completely stupid and preposterous . haha
