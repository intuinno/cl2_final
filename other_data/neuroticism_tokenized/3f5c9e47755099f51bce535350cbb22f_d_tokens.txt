It's amazing how life goes on . Sometimes you think you really need something and time passes and you forget all about it . Time truly heals all wounds(well some of them anyway ) . Gotta take life one day at a time and try not to sweat the small stuff ... because it really doesn't matter . 
Shout out my soul for the love of God ( repeat like 4x ) I forgot the rest ...

My Saints lookin good 
FUMBLE !!! 
The giants are looking itty bitty 
I can't wait to hear all about how the Giants weren't healthy , yada yada yada ... we're kicking their butts ... and handing it to them 
Classic win for the Saints ... one for the History books . 
I wouldn't be surprised if the Titans take shots at Brady ... why is he still even in the game ? 45-0 at the half 
I hate the Falcons 
It's a shame that people can't get an eduaction without worring about getting stabbed ... SMH 
* or shot up or something 
WTH is wrong with people 
abra cadabra * poof * 
[ RANT]NPHC step show-1st , how dare they charge $10 to see them stop thier feet(and do some played out dances ) on that rickety stage !!! 2nd , how dare they have this \event\ " in the BALLROOM--It's not like they had to pay to rent the place ! .... To Be Continued " 
I want some funnel cake 
What I learned today : that ' stickem ' on those gloves is really sticky 
The Saints are the best team in the NFL ! 21-point deficit ? No problem . Wildcat ? No problem . Yes indeed folks . Believe it . 
< PROPMALE > Tut looks like he would have grew up to be a hottie ... ;) 
I can't wait for the Hornets game tonight . They're gonna surprise a lot of people this season . It's a great time to be a New Orleans sports fan !!! 
Laughing at my sister listening to \Bill\ " LOL " 
I can't stand the Spurs !!! ugh ... Hornets gotta play better defense ... < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > needs to get out of his ' daze ' ... I can't believe we passed on Blair(even though he doesn't have an ACL , WTF ? ) 
So my Hornets lost tonight ... It's just 1 game in an 82-game season . Okafor looked good . CP was his usual amazing self . West was West ... Peja is old and our bench leaves everything to be desired ... That being said , I think they can win 50+ games this season . 
\Life is just one damned thing after another . \ " ---- Erbert Hubbard ... the weekend needs to hurry up " 
gettin ready to take my psychology test ... 
This semester is going by fast ... I'm actually enjoying it :) ... I guess that's why lol

Great Win for my Hornets tonight !!! 
The Raptors were on fire tonight(especially in the 3rd Q) -- they couldn't miss from 3 . They live & die by the 3 , tonight they were as hot as ever . Long season folks . It's just November . 
Hmmm Alabama vs Florida in the SEC Championship game ... the refs had to fight hard to make it happen ... congrats to them . 
I can't stand < PROPMALE > Saban or Urban Meyer . I hope the earth opens up for them and their teams to fall in ... never to be heard from again . 
Come on Saints !!! 
The D steped up when they had to . 8-0 !!! Go Saints !!! 
I hate Kobe and his Lakers ... ugh Come on CP3 , ur the real MVP !!! 
Go away < PROPFEMALE > !! 
I love seeing my Hornets on ESPN , but these late tip-offs have me going to sleep late 
The Hornets are looking pathetic right now ... luckily it's still early in the season . 
The Hornets have a lot of work to do . That is all . 
\Hornets fire Coach < PROPMALE > Scott\ " ... season down the drain already ? " 
I'm so pissed at ULL right now .... What's the point of listing classes in your * NEW * bulliten if you're not going to offer them in the fall OR the spring ? What type if crap is that ? BS is what it is . 
Waitin patiently for some suckaz to drop out of Spanish 102 so I can get in ... 
Saints 9-0 ... btu do they HAVE to give us all heart attacks on the way ??? 
Saints CB < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > could possibly have a torn ACL ... this sucks with the Pats coming to town in 2 weeks . :( I hope it's just a strain or deep bruise . We can't afford to lose any more guys from the defense . 
The Colts aren't looking good ... Saints might be the only undefeated team left . Who woulda thought that ? 
Check out the Colts !!! I can't stand the Pats !!! 
Statistics exam tomorrow morning ... pray for me ya'll

LOLz LAkers ... the Hornets might be the only undefeated team left soon 
I wonder what it's gonna take for people to try and see life through another persons eyes . I wonder what it'll take for people to think about the consequences of their actions before they commit them . What will make people actually care ?
