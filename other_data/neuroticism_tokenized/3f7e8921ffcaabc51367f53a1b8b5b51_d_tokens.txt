I wonder if there's any oil in the shrimp I'm eating ... 

I really need to finish Gilead . : l 
Temp . feels great outside but why do mosquitoes have to exist ? 
1 . AP History\ 
2 . PAP Chem\ 
3 . Bible ( Hensley ... oh no)\ 
4 . PAP Eng\ 
5 . Latin II\ 
6 . PAP Alg II\ 
7 . X-Country 
i can't fall asleep ... 
So now I have to transfer to regular chemistry because one of the pap classes was 7 people , and since I have Latin II it conflicts with the current Pap class . Brilliant . 
\I'll pray 
Its the first day of school and I've already spent two hours doing homework . 
Going to see \mommy\ " in an hour . Hahaha . " 
Not as bad as I thought . :) 
Is it just me or can nobody reply to the forums Mrs. Bryant set-up ?

< PROPMALE > upon your wall for the world to see\ 
Reminds us all of what we used to be

So ... my shoes changed colors from white to black today . 
So , to write love on her arms is going on , and after algebra class today , I noticed I had these 5 or 6 indentions on my forearm that looked like wicked scars . they went away after a bit . strange coincidence . 
\You know 
tomorrow will be epic . just wait . 
is wearing black , red , and white facepaint to the game and it's probably something you don't want to miss . 
History notecards make me want to shoot myself in the foot 
so I've been doing homework non-stop since 4:30 and I just finished . 100 minutes of homework according to the handbook . right . 
so I had to think for a second if I had ran this morning or not cause it already seems like days ago somehow . I must be completely out of it . 
I despise making a script for latin . truly 
So I'm pretty sure everyone that comes to algebra II tomorrow will have completely different answers on the 4x4 determinants . 
It seems I had forgotten that soccer can be fun . 
great weather for camping 
I can wear the shirt to school tomorrow and not be ashamed 
I'll admit ... 
So don't wait for someone to tell you it's too late\ 
' Cause these are the best days\ 
There's always something tomorrow\ 
So I say let's make the best of tonight\ 
Here comes the rest of our lives\ 
? 
tornado horn going off by my house maybe another tree will fall on top of the house this time too ? ha 
is at six flags 
weekend was way too short 
imaginary < PROPFIRST > will be the end of me 
Go rangers ! Oh .... wait . just kidding . 
I don't even know what this umpire is doing . 
what happens behind the curtain stays behind the curtain it seems . 
I found Mr. Hensley's gravestone yesterday .... weird . 
google translate now has a latin to english translation engine . modern-day miracles exist . 
< PROPFEMALE > sitter här i venten och spelar lite DotA\

Old song but it's still good . ( Swedish ) 
I love when I spend 15 minutes trying to factor something and it turns out it's an \irreducible factorization \"." 
Maybe that's how books get written\ 
Maybe that's why songs get sung\ 
Maybe we are the unlucky ones . 
thunder ... 
it's 72 degrees in the middle of November ... typical Texas I guess 
I think my hands are frozen ... oh and by the way , happy thanksgiving everybody . 
sunset and sunrise were both brilliant today 
unfinished essay left in the classroom ? ? 
sometimes I like it when my soccer ball gets taken . 
no homework ? is that possible ? 
I think I'll stay up till 4:30 to watch the eclipse ... and then pass out . 
1770 on the SAT . not bad , but not quite good enough 
So I'm pretty sure today is the summer solstice , not the winter one . 
I'm dreaming of a wet christmas ... 
O Come , O Come , < PROPMALE > 
So I'm getting out of the car to walk in to panda express and , oh hey , what do you know , I step into somebody's throwup . Appetite = gone 
There are only two < PROPMALE > flaws with the obtainment of knowledge . \ 
1 . Knowledge of history is written by the winning side . \ 
2 . The futility of obtaining knowledge . No matter how much knowledge individual people or collective humanity gain , they will repeat their past mistakes 
Just wondering , is anyone actually going to chapel tomorrow ? 
It would have been nice of my dog to leave me some of my chocolates , but of course , he didn't . 
Pull off my cleat and my sock has a huge bloodstain on it . Cool . 
Why can't we have a switch on us that says \Sleep\ " and then \ " ON\ " and \ " OFF \"?" 
Convinced my parents to let me blow out my birthday candles at 11:11 1/11/11 \ 
:) 
We dance upon the street we call pretend . \ 
But I can't shake the feeling , \ 
I don't want this to end . \ 
I can read you like the map that takes you anywhere . 
I think I'll go to sleep now . Someone wake me up when the summer gets here . 
' Cause if nothing else , we're given a little time\ 
To change the game , a < PROPMALE > to redefine\ 
Everything we are , \ 
In our January white\ 
This year is a sealed envelope , \ 
A culmination of hopes , \ 
The lottery result that we've been crossing fingers for 
I'm sitting in church and a random person sits down next to me . I could've sworn I heard an \eric\ " and I turned my head . Huh ? < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? Small world . " 
You're a little bit early on the summer weather , Texas . 
is tired . 
The warmth of blankets makes me nervous , \ 
I'd rather catch a cold ... 
As gentle as feathers\ 
The snow piles high\ 
Our world gets rewritten and retraced every time\ 
Like fresh plates and clean slates\ 
Our future is white 
I think I'll just skip school on thursday . 
I tried to go to the park to practice , but ... yeah it's way too cold . 
I'm not even sure what to do now since I'm so used to doing homework everyday ... sleep maybe ? 
To be honest ... 
tomorrow's weather looks almost perfect , barely any wind 
cannot sleep at all \ 
<3 
5 hour nap . 
Track is the worst thing ever invented . 
Give up school for lent ? 
Had 9 hours of sleep for the past 2 days 
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but to save the world through him . \ 
< PROPFIRST > 3:16 -17 
Maybe the soul is a suitcase that holds the backup plan -\ 
A collection of keys and the < PROPFEMALE > we need\ 
To start again . 
4 day weekend 
Wouldn't it be logical for school to be easier instead of becoming more difficult towards the end of the year ? Apparently not . 
Here we go again ... truth is :
