sitting around playing games and watching law SVU 

i think and remonise on things i miss feelings words sensations then i role through all the time and remember y it ended and why i grew past it 
I dont get why ppl would do there best to bug and irratate an d complain about the person they are with and break it off and get back toegther over and over if it doesn't work the first time y would it work the 5th or 25th ??? 
ppl keep flipping out on me cuz they read into things i write like im meaning only them and instead of just asking why i write things and listening they flip out on me and then dont listen whats the point of asking if they wont listen seriously it causes drama that makes me want to shoot them instead of listen to them flipping out !!!!!! SOS !!! 
Bekka freaked out on me last night for just asking questions ( pretty much being me ) im starting to believe wat lys says MAYBE SHE'S JUST CRAZY !!! 
sitting around with < PROPFEMALE > talking aboutt the new things happen and the crazy ppl in our lives lmao
