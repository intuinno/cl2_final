There come a time in your life , when you must stop procrastinating , or waiting for all the ducks to be lined up perfectly before you make your move . Instead become proactive , put all your eggs in one basket , give it to god , and confidently take on the uncertainties that come your way . For me , that time is NOW !

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies , they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . Repost if you have one true friend . They will know who they are
