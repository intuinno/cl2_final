Stupid Statanic Project ... dlskj flkmsgk rwjtlgj dgjf otweuitrlkfmdlkfgheaouihlka ; nflkgdflgjadlfk jg rawr I'm mad 
Lithium may look pretty , but it really should be kept away from nature . It has quite a few disagreements with Oxygen , Nitrogen , and water in the air . It's very corrosive , which means it sort of eats away at things , so try to not frolic around and scatter it everywhere like snow just because you don't want to go to school . You won't have to go to school , but it will be because you will be in the hospital . 
Epic : This just in .... CATA was on the news ... our football team was shown not winning on the news ...... oye . 14 to 40 . Maybe next time guys . We are getting there ...

To see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with that person . Alternatively , you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person .

Sleepy time for me now . Night all . 
Sometimes I actually do wish that God would turn me into a bird , because I really would fly far , far away . I'd soar up to the sun , and slide down a moonbeam .

On this day FDR began the New Deal program . 
I got to wake up just like a movie character today ... I was in a big bed , with a squishy foam matress , a hugely thick comforter , an awkward twisting of my body , and a dog licking my cheek . LOL waking up to < PROPFIRST > is better than waking up to a dog like Beethoven ..... * twitch * 
Just saw Chaplin , with R.D.J. it was one of the best movies i've seen in a while ... It was depressing on so many levels though . 
Today I was reminded just how much I idolize and love < PROPFIRST > Chaplin . 
\Nothing's a break for me . Not even the breaks are \ 
Watching Spice World ... I'm surprised how I still know the whole thing by heart ! 
At the doctor ... the woman at the desk reminds of Professor Umbridge .... urgh 
I believe it would be safe to assume that the USA eithre won ... or is winning by a large amount due to everyone updating their status to ... \USA !!!! \ " or the ever popular \ " YES ! \ " or Just the letters \ " USA\ " repeated ultiple times ... " 
I'm so happy ... there are 8 < PROPFIRST > Downey , Jr. movies coming up ! 
Off to watch Iron Man ! WOOT ! ( about time huh ? i'm so behind on movies ... )

Haircut ! Yay it's all gone and I love it ! 
Alright ... so my back is in horrific pain BUT my legs and feet feel great , and I saw so many amazing things . Some tears were shed at the Vietnam Memorial ... and tomorrow promises the Smithsonian and the Holocaust Museum . I <3 the meyers !
