has abandoned all her applications and groups , and just let all my requests pile up unopened . Perhaps it's time for a Facebook break . :-(((((( 
has found a bug and is slowly , cruelly torturing it to death . Maybe they should rename me Guantanabottom . I have no respect for the < PROPFEMALE > Conventions . :-/ 
So I love my stick figure family ( boxes tab ) , but I do wonder : Are stick figures an equal opportunity < PROPMALE > form ? Cause how the hell would one make a black person stick figure ????? The beard is dead on , but still the depiction of my Daddy is way far off . :-/ Oh ! I also need to know how to do stick figure dreadlocks . C'mon guys , help me out ! Upload your best drawing of a black , bearded , rasta stickman for me ! MOL ...

Mommy's cat Nacho , who she grew up with and who has been living with her Grandma the last eight years , died today . He was 16 . : ' -((((( 
All I want for Christmas is Gimpch ! 
is annoying as hell . I'm ridiculously insistant about sleeping between my humans . I did this as a baby , which was last winter . They fear I'll do this all winter every winter . I lick them too . Then I cry all morning for food . And I have food . I just refuse to eat it when it gets below the 1/3 < PROPFIRST > , like I distrust my humans for no reason at all . In sum , Wormbottom ' o G ' Cat is annoying as hell . * evil laugh * 
Fight time . 
needs to borrow someone's Afro Sheen . Homies ? 
It's hard out here for a pimp . :/ 
Whew ! Thank God I'm home . Mom was worried it was gonna be another edition of \Where's Wormbo ? \ " tonight . MOL ... " 
Oh shit ... :-((( Mommy and Daddy discovered another battle wound on me . Thank God on my tail , not my torso this time . It's scabby , bleeding , spewing nasty-smelling pus ... I was trying to play it off like it was no big deal , but Mommy spotted it . They held me down and applied peroxide to me while I clawed and hissed . It was extremely traumatizing , for all those involved . :-((( 
When you hear about domestic terrorists , they're referring to Wu < PROPFEMALE > , right ? :-/ 
Guess what !?!?!! Mommy saw a license plate today that read \WORMED1 . \ " COOL !!!! ROFM ... " 
The humans have been sleeping in their giant hammock lately . I snooze on the carpet directly underneath and swat at any limbs that dangle my way . This reminded Daddy of that one < PROPFEMALE > tale with the < PROPFIRST > goats and earned me a new nickname : \The Troll Under the Bridge . \ " MOL ... " 
Anyone else see the Top Chef finale the other night ? I want some of some of that roast squab with pinenut cassoulet ! I'm happy to supply the pigeon myself . MOL 
What's the best type of treats to ask < PROPFEMALE > for ? I really would prefer a nestful of baby birdies ; live treats are my fave . But Mommy says if I put that on the list < PROPFEMALE > might think I'm evil and then I might be in danger of getting nothing at all . :-/// 
Thank you SO much friends for thinking of me . * headbutts * * purrs * But if a fat man enters my room in the middle of the night and tries to toss me in a sack , that fat man is risking a serious ass-whooping . You might wanna tell < PROPFEMALE > he's dealing with a real G before sending him my way . ROFM ... 
These privacy settings are a b **** . 
I knocked one of them little plastic coffee cream cups off the table into Mommy's shoe . She did notice and put the shoe on . Coffee creamer exploded all over her foot ! ROFM ROFM !!!!.... * lick * I rule . MOL 
COOL !!! Iron Chef < PROPFEMALE > Bacon Battle . * mesmerization * 
The cable box is my best friend . :))) * purr * I sleep on it all the time . My back presses up againt the TV censor so the humans can't adjust the volume . And sometimes I even dangle my paw in front of the cable box censor so they can't change channels either !! Hahahaha ! * evil laugh * * purr * * snooze * 
I'm about to isolate myself . See ? Watch . * isolate * 
I'm depressed . 
Should I change my name ? 
If I were a random cat , what would you name me ? 
I met my other grandpa last night -- Grandpa < PROPMALE > ! We call him \Big < PROPMALE >.\" ROFM ... " 
Wow ! My brother got engaged ! :-) And < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to everyone ! Wormbottom's not the most festive of cats , but I'll put my little < PROPFEMALE > suit back on for ya ... 
I hate when the humans eat breakfast food ... It's TORTURE for me .... it involves everything I like .. cheese , eggs , ham , bacon , butter ... .. ... .. .. * cryyyyyyyyyyy * 
I finally made a new application except it's not working .. :'(((( 
Hooray !!! I fixed my new application and am about to send it out in droves ! MOL

I jumped on a goat at the dinner table because I can't control myself ! 
I've got to say , I LOVE these new Cafe World gifts . I got 400 lobsters to serve today ! That would have NEVER happened before . ROFM 
Grandpa < PROPMALE > and Uncle < PROPMALE > came over today . They think I'm funny but really I was thinking the same about them . ROFM

In the meantime , I don't want to food fight ! I changed my wall to separate my posts and friends posts , not cause I'm an egomaniac , but because I'm drowning in Tabasco ! ( Drowning in spam ? I wish ! * drool * MOL ) 
I am about to start another group . MOL * scurry off * 
There's a Cold War going on in our household . I have stolen Mommy's armchair . I told her to just go sit under it ( that's what Wu < PROPFEMALE > does , under Daddy's chair ) ... 
Mommy never gets me anything when she goes to Taco < PROPFEMALE > . Today I asked for a crunchy taco , no lettuce , no tomato , extra cheese , sour cream in a cup on the side , and definitely no hot sauce ( though it doesn't come with hot sauce , please specify just in case * hiss * MOL ) . But did I receive it ? No !!!! Oh well .. she'd probably mess up my order anyways . :/ 
I finally thought of the one thing I'm willing to give up for lent : Trying . Yes !!! :D

Mommy's trying to teach me how to play Grand Theft Auto . * swerve * 
I love my little turban outfit , but it's hardly inconspicuous . I'm always being frisked for security purposes ( which ain't that bad , actually , it's basically like petting ! MOL ) But I don't like being labeled a terrorist . Clearly I prefer the term \gangsta . \ " ROFM ... " 
Chasing Wu < PROPFEMALE>'s tail . * attack * 
Well , I'm off to create another new restaurant . I'm VERY excited to announce that this one will ONLY serve brunch items and sweets . The best part , of course , is the name ( are you ready ? MOL ): \BumBum's YumYums . \ " ROFM ... " 
I'm depressed . My cafe is all messed up and it seems Mommy's going to have to write to tech support . :'(

Ok , so how come no roast rabbit for Easter's in Cafe World ?? It's a French delicacy !! What gives ?!? 
Oh no . I just heard Mommy say , \I gotta take the O.G. to the the vet next week . \ " * look around * I don't see anyone else she could be referring to so ... :// " 
Even when my bowl is full , I sometimes prefer to just climb inside my giant kibble bag to eat . The ambience is really nice . MOL

In spring I do my own thing . MOL 
My Mommy has a terrible pain in the butt . And I don't mean me . ROFM She seems to have pulled a butt muscle or something . ( MOL .. ) It's on the right side so when she drives during and afterwards it's excruciating . I cuddled her neck and it made her feel a < PROPFEMALE > bit better ... maybe I should cuddle her bum ? :/ I just wish there were something I could do .... 
When Mommy won't let me outside I get up on my hind legs and twist the doorknob . I can never get a good enough grip though . :/ 
Mmm , the kibble's good tonight , makin ' me purrrrr ... MOL
