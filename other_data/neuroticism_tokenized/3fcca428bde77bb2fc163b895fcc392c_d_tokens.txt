Time to go back to school 

WAHHHHH !!!! Overwhelmed ! ( Sort of ) 
Seriously Steph you are going to flood my email box !!! 
I need Facebook for dummies . You guys are sort of overwhelming me !!!! I'm drowing in friend requests !!!! 
Day Two : Fingers stretched , seat cushioned , schedule cleared , and snacks within arms length . Let the Facebook onslaught begin ! \ 
\ 
Right now I don't know if I love you guys or if I hate you guys . I had 187 emails from Facebook last night . 
I just watched my picture up loads go from 100% to 0% to 60% . Weird . 
Do not be alarmed ! I was just looking at everyones walls and accidently clicked on someones quiz results . Then I got curious and tried out a few ! It was fun in a mindless sort of way . I got 101% for the how Asian are you but I decided not to publish that one . : ) 
Whew . I was just a part of a live chat with Cal Poly . It was tons of fun , but man is the process for getting your classes complicated . And we have to go through it every quarter . That's such a pain !!! 
Irregardless , I'm so excited about going to Cal Poly . GO Mustangs !! 
I know this is a little late , but it just occurred to me . Thank you to all my awesome and cool friends ! High school wouldn't have been the same without you ! 
seriously wants the phrase \as shiny as < PROPFIRST > Cullen in sunlight\ " to catch on as a way to say something isn't very shiny . " 
You know you're blind when you wake up , set your laptop on your lap and then reach for your glasses because you can't read your screen . 
is trying to decide what to pack when she goes to Alaska . 
is still trying to decide what to pack for Alaska ... she thinks her suitcase is overweight ( a little like her ) 
I just stayed up to watch all of A Very Potter Musical on You Tube .... Stupid , but lots of fun ... and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Finally packed for Alaska . I'm happy that is over . And my bag was underweight so I'm extra excited . 
See you guys in about a week ! Love you all ! 
I'm BACK !!!!! Boo , Alaska was really , really , really fun . Pictures and videos coming soon ! And sorry < PROPFIRST > I didn't get to go to < PROPMALE > or fish . 
I started packing for college today . It was kind of weird . 
Great Scotts ! I can't believe I stayed up to watch all three Back to the Future movies .... 
I should have worn a hat to < PROPFIRST>'s party yesterday . I burned my part and now the top of my head feels so hot that I think you could cook an egg on it . 
I just learned how to knit !!! I am so excited . 
I just watched A Very Potter Sequel !!! Love to Starkid !!! But why < PROPFIRST > ( it was hilarious ) but why < PROPFIRST > ? 
SIRIUS BLACK !!!!! SIRIUS BLAAAAAAA oh , checkmate . SIRIUS BLAAAAAAACK !!!!!! 
For all my Poly pals , housing comes out on August 20th at 9:00 AM 
I got home yesterday from SOAR . \ 
1 ) Information overload . \ 
2 ) the class system is really confusing\ 
3 ) it really helps to look at the catalog ( PASS ) before you go\ 
4 ) lectures are really boring\ 
5 ) I was in a group of people that were all chemistry majors\ 
6 ) it's always nice when someone else has the same problem you do\ 
7 ) always call the College Board to make sure they sent your scores 
Today I spent four hours in San < PROPFIRST > shopping for school clothes after < PROPFIRST > did a quick repair on my clarinet . But the best part of the day was sitting down and enjoying a cup of Cherries Garcia ... it was a bowl of happiness . Honestly , I think that's the happiest I've been in a while . 
Just got home from visiting her grandpa in Fresno . And he gave me a ( wait for it ) ukelele ! Now I feel obligated to learn how to play at least one piece . 
is finding out who her roommate at Cal Poly will be tomorrow . Excited ! 
feels really guilty . It wasn't until just now that she realized that she didn't include her sister under siblings ... Sorry < PROPFEMALE > 
Passing my driver's test after 2 and 1/2 hours at the DMV , awesome . Getting to see WICKED tonight , super mega boss ultra radical sweet epic bonus awesome ! 
Ifyou believe in\ 
Jesus Christ , put this on your wall . Do not just ignore this . In the\ 
Bible it says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you\ 
in front of My Father , at the Gates of Heaven . 
can't believe she just got up at 6 AM and she didn't have to go to school . 
made mochiko chicken for dinner today . So good ! Yummy ! 
Just saw < PROPMALE > and Gabe as I left Target to do some dorm shopping .... Now if only packing were as easy as shopping ... 
The Challenge ? 5 Shakespeare plays in 5 days . \ 
And no , it isn't required reading for school . 
So ... I was going to go visit all my band people tomorrow and < PROPFEMALE > out with you guys during lunch . But it looks like you guys don't have lunch tomorrow ? No matter , I'll just see you guys at the end of your music block . 
I initiated a sneak attack on my band people today . It was great seeing everyone ! ( And you sound pretty good too . ) The best reaction though goes to Faizal who upon realizing that I was walking next to him squealed like a girl , leapt to hug me and didn't let go . I ended up carrying him halfway down one of < PROPFIRST>'s halls . I'm going to miss you guys , but you'll be fine ! 
Thanks for everything . See everyone Thanksgiving week . Hello Cal Poly . 
Headed to Cal Poly !!! Man it is early ! 
Just spent my first night in Muir at Cal Poly . The first of many . Ready for a full day ahead ! 
WoW overload ... So much fun , so little time !!! 
I can't believe school starts tomorrow ... I can't believe I have to get up for an eight o'clock class ... I can't believe that I'm complaining ... :) 
Right now chilling in the library in-between classes . College is pretty cool so far ! 
Relaxing in my dorm room after my first day of college is awesome ! 
Long day at school 
Eating Nutella and Wheat Thins . Life is good . :) 
1st real Chem lab today . After going through the whole experiment without knocking over anything , I manage to break a ceramic crucible and two lids . The professor comes over and the first thing she asks is \Did you get the measurement ? \ " College rocks " 
In a titration lab , bright pink is a bad thing . 
Might not be able to make it to championships ... ;( 
I just saw a deer . Like < PROPFEMALE>'s mom . In the street across from the PAC at Cal Poly . It was cool . :D 
GAHHHH ! I have \Who I'd Be\ " from Shrek the Musical stuck in my head . " 
The best part of today ? Sleeping on the grass for an hour and a half in bare feet after a public speaking midterm . Sigh , bliss 
Walked out of my dorm room today and had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming . WHAT THE HECK ARE TURKEYS DOING ON THE DORM LAWN ?????????? 
has never been so happy to get a B on a test . Ever . 
Eating at Chick-fil-A twice a week ? This can't be healthy . 
I have my first band concert this Friday . Today our director pulled a Mr. Barrea . What is it with band directors and throwing babies ? O.o 
Letters make me happy ! I ? my friends . :D 
Had my first band concert here at SLO . Missed all my band peeps . It just isn't the same without you guys . 
Is kind of creeped out . She just spent an hour in seminar with all the other biochem and chem TEACHERS . 
There is simply not enough time in a day to fit in everything I want to do . Can I afford to start lab research next quarter ? * scratches head * 
Captain Obvious , please meet my best friend < PROPMALE > Sarcasm . I'm sure the two of you will get along fine . 
Chem Lab Quote of the Day : \My sister is so lucky . She doesn't need a calculator to draw straight lines . \ " \ 
Cal Poly : The only place where you have to stand in line for the salad bar . 
Just a thought . If you have type B blood and you're Asian , are you Asian flunking ? 
Inside Math Joke of the Day \INFERIOR !!!!!!!! \"" 
Panini from Campus Market = the best thing I've eaten here at Cal Poly 
Did I just not eat that much this week ? Friday and I have 5/8 meal credits left . Huh 
Gonna head down to VG's for a late night ice cream run at about 10 . 
There and back again . Said hi to < PROPMALE > who didn't hear me , since there was new ice cream out ! 
Public Speaking ... why ? 
Well < PROPMALE > you win this round , but next year victory will be ours !!! My favorite part of the night though was listening to the band off after the game . Videos to follow of saxophone surprises and general shenanigans . 
\The molecule is actually the purple mule . \ " Thank you Professor Martinez for making my day . " 
The only thing more epic than the < PROPMALE > Potter preview ? Riding home with 8 people in a car made for 4 . Driver , shotgun , four people squished in the back , one person across our laps , and one person in the trunk . That's right . Oh yeah , best of luck to all < PROPFIRST > . Kill ' em at Championships . 
First thing I thought when I got home : I'M HOME !!!!! \ 
The second thing : \Surviving Sondheim\ " sounds like the title of a good musical . " 
Had a great time catching up with friends and family . Only two weeks until winter break ! 
Main Piece for Winter Quarter : Music for Prague\ 
Brings back memories :D \ 
* car horn * duh duh duh ... duh duh ... duh duh duh duh duh 
Hello Finals week . Please excuse me while I prepare to kick your ass . 
Well all my finals have been kicked . Only time will tell if it was in the ass . 
If my life were a book last night's chapter would read : After a train ride home , < PROPFEMALE > descended like a swarm of locust on her home and then proceeded to take a shower and go to bed . 
can't believe how many Christmas cookies she's made . 
YOU !!! Yes YOU ! If you have Netflix , stop whatever you are doing and go on your account now . I MEAN IT !! Go on your account and put Blast ( 2001 ) on your queue . Don't look at me like that . DO IT NOW !! And then watch your mail box like a dog watching bacon until it comes . DON'T LAUGH !! When it comes clear your schedule and watch it . IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND !!!! 
Hanging at Wing Stop with the Band Crew after being greeted by Vuvuzelas , then going to the mall with < PROPFEMALE > and Steph for ear piercing , and then running into < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > = A night full of laughter and memories 
Festive Fun in Fresno : five full days of family , friends , food , and orange cleaning . Nothing like family tradition . 
Is back in the Bay Area ! Sorry for the Facebook Hiatus , I'm sure all of you missed me terribly . 
IT LIVES ! My beautiful non-programable scientific calculator lives !! Now I can go to Chem lab tomorrow . 
Third and fourth day of the quarter and I am officially sick . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Brodzinsky I think I < PROPMALE > out with you too much over the break . 
Is it really almost the end of the second week of school ? 
They found me ! Noooooooooooooooooooooo . Good bye old Facebook profile . 
Words can not describe how much I love < PROPFEMALE > Hendson right now . <3 <3 <3 
Got surprised by a cake from my parents ! Went on a hunt to try to get some people to take a slice . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Brodzinsky is the best and words cannot describe how much I love her <3 !!!!!!!! I owe you and < PROPFEMALE > Hendson thank you letters !!!! Keep an eye on the mailbox ! 
is preparing for two days of midterm hell . Suddenly < PROPMALE > makes sense : Abandon hope all who enter here . 
I wish that you could absorb information just by laying your head on your books . It would be much more effective than banging my head against them . 
Busy . Busy . Oh a Netflix movie .... Busy . 
Highlights of today : Talking to Professor Hagen about doing spring research and listening to a < PROPMALE > professor with a Scottish accent talk about beer . Ahh , life is good ! :D 
I can't believe it . The cosmic balance of the universe must be uneven . There was no one at the Starbucks in the UU . Someone needs to go check if hell has frozen over . 
Finally done being busy ... for now 
About to go on an adventure to visit < PROPFEMALE > Ung and Biola ! Can't wait ! 
Had sooooooo much fun in the past three days . PS I love the bathrooms at Biola ! < PROPFEMALE > Ung 
Has the Cal Poly Rotation Blues . No registering for class until Wednesday ;( 
The only way to beat the CP Rotation blues is to watch Firefly . Because one can not be depressed when watching Firefly . 
This must be what it feels like to go mad ...... A few minutes later in Canton .... NO . This must be what it feels like to go mad . 
I have my classes !!!!! Martinez for Chem and another Monday morning lab . But I am happy ! :D 
Thanks to the Cal Poly weather yesterday I no longer have to imagine what it would be like to live inside a cloud . 
\To rock is the absence of sucking . \ " Professor Bush paraphrasing his son . Best . Quote . Ever . " 
A two < PROPFEMALE > letter from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Brodzinsky ? Pigs must be flying ( that was for the \dinner\ " dig :P ) . Love ya ! <3 " 
Just watched Serenity . Joss Whedon , curse you for your sudden but inevitable betrayal of Wash ! 
wants to be at home . Right now . And not studying for finals . 
is feeling very proud of herself at the moment . All my finals are done and I used 4 meal credits yesterday - a momentous occasion for any Cal Poly student . 
Any body else going to Dance , Drum and Guard tomorrow ? < PROPFEMALE > Hendson < PROPFIRST > Stevenin < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Brodzinsky < PROPFIRST > Galiza de < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Galiza de < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Chen < PROPMALE > Mistica < PROPFIRST > Wang Ramneek Gill < PROPFIRST > Stauffer 
So long Spring break . Thanks to everyone who made it special ! Love you all , see you in June ! 
Thanks to my Aunt and my mom , I have a new respect for Chinese Checkers . The game was so intense people would actually forget whose turn it was . Also back in SLO and can't wait for Chem lab tomorrow .
