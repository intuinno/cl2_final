Staying at a friends . 

is wishing that I could get together with friends more often . 
I love public librarys ! 
might be going to visit his family in South < PROPFEMALE > . 
Finally in S.C. 
My BF isn't on today ... :( 
Yay ! I finally got ahold of someone in MI ! 
Going to the Atlantic Ocean tomorrow . Can't wait . 
RIP : Little Kitten 
Just got an MP3 player . One of the songs that came with it rocks my socks off . 
Feeling good . Just talked to an old friend . Ah , nostagia ... 
Really bored . :( 
Not bored anymore . Actually feeling good . Thank you < PROPFIRST > ! 
Bored beyond reason . 
Meh ... 
Having one of my better days . 
Threw caution to the wind , but I've got a lousy arm ... 
can't wait for homecoming . The only problem is his mom won't show up with his money ... 
is waiting to see if the other guy is gonna make his move . 
Massive HEADACHE !!! 
I think I'm just not into the whole \facebook games\ " anymore . Sorry for those whoo keep on sending me app invites . " 
Also , I think I want to get my hair done blue . 
\The descent into hell is easy . \ " - < PROPFIRST > \ " The Aenid \"" 
Okay . I have just made the realization that I'm a fanboy for < PROPMALE > & The Chipmunks . I'm currently in the process of hording all things related to them . I'll let you know how that goes ... 
I want a refund on my life ... 
\Well maybe you need to start being the right guy . That's why you got punched out . ' Cause you got the wrong attitude right outta the gate . \ " - Yes Man " 
Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy ? 
Just over at a friends . Gonna make movie magic tomorrow . 
So , I was just browsing YouTube and stumbled upon this ... 
Going to have fun now that I`m out of high school . 
I just made it into the core company at TBT ! I am possibly the most excited person in the world right now . 
Doubt opens tonight ! Come to see it . 
So soltanto come si pronuncia questa frase . 
Have you heard ? Thunder Bay Theater is having it's last show of the summer season ! \The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\ " So be there or be S-Q-U-A-R-E !!! " 
Come and see \Spelling Bee\ " in it's final week of production . I'd be E-C-S-T-A-T-I-C if you did ! " 
Just so you know , I'm not the woman in my profile pic . 
\Everybody's got the right to be happy . \ " So come see Assassins over at Thunder Bay Theater ! " 
If you really knew me , you would know how paranoid I really am . 
I wish I could have what I want . That my dreams would come true . That everything would work out . \ 
\ 
I also wish I wasn't so depressed sounding . 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2011 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ? 
Funny how your mood can go from happy and bubbly to sad and depressed in so little time ... 
Best Comment Ever : \If [ Wal-mart ] put in a coffee or real bar they would own the town . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > ! 
Click the \like\ " button if i have ever made you smile . Then set this as your status and see how many people you have made smile (: " 
Just played on the X-box Kinect . It's a blast ! 
2010 is almost over ! So INBOX me something you always wanted to tell me . It will stay between us . Post this as your status & see what you get ! 
Step , together , step , together . The Kinect game Dance Central thinks that I don't know how to mirror someone on a TV , so it tells me exactly what to do . lol 
So no one told you life was gonna be this way 
Zadok the priest , and < PROPMALE > the prophet anointed < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
I'm a stitch away from making it 
agrees with < PROPFEMALE > Laub . 
\I like this show ... Let's invite the audience . \"" 
Can't be bothered to go through my entire friends list right now . I'm doing a January cleaning . So if you see this ... You made the first cut .

Watched < PROPMALE > of Persia : Sands of Time . Now I'm wondering what would happen if I went back in time and changed some things , how would they turn out ? 
ASKING IF EVERYONE COULD PLEASE PUT THIS AS YOUR STATUS FOR ONE HOUR IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS OR HAD CANCER . MY PRAYER IS THAT IN 2011 A CURE WILL BE FOUND . WILL YOU POST IT ? JUST ONE HOUR . DO IT FOR ALL OF US IN MEMORY OF TOO MANY TO MENTION AND IN HONOR OF ALL FIGHTING IT !! 
Click like if u are glad we met and post as your status and see how many people are glad they met you 
Finally got through my friends list like I've been meaning to . If you made it , good for you . If you didn't and you can read this message , then drop me a line and convince me I'm wrong for de-friending you . 
Getting ready for our opening night of Guys On Ice . Come see the show , it's a real hum dinger ! 
Just had a tooth removed . I like it . I don't have that searing pain anymore ! 
The age old question ... \What am I going to do until the next thing I have to do ? \"" 
I just rediscovered my speech recognition software on my laptop . This status was completely hands free . 
If you love me ; comment on this status\ 
If you think I'm good friend ; like this status\ 
If you ever had a crush on me ; poke me\ 
If you hate me ; message me && tell me why\ 
If your not scared post this as your status 
So let me get this STRAIGHT ...... Larry < PROPMALE > is on his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55-hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with everyone ; and yet the idea of same-sex marriage is still going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post to your < PROPFEMALE > if you agree - Proud to support equal rights 
My friend , < PROPFIRST > Walchak , just uploaded a whole slew of photos of me . I just went back and looked at all the years that have passed . I have really changed . 
Go to your profile . The first five people to appear on the sidebar of your friends section are on your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > Link , < PROPMALE > McGuire , < PROPFEMALE > Ouellette , < PROPFIRST > Beck , and < PROPFIRST > Hilton . \ 
I think that < PROPFIRST > and I could hold off the zombies long enough for us to find a shelter . 
I have something really fun to do . Post a story of how we met . It could be true or not . If you think someone else's story is true , ' like ' it . If you think it's false , comment on it . 
If you have a wonderful man who helps balance your whole world , who isn't perfect , but perfect for you , who works hard & would do anything for you , who makes you laugh & drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who takes care of you , who you want to grow old with , who you are thankful for everyday & who you could not live without , then brag on him a little & re-post .
