And when He had said this , He breathed on them , and said to them , “Receive the Holy Spirit . http://bible.us/John20.22.NKJV 
And He said to them , “Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some . ” So they cast , and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish . http://bible.us/John21.6.NKJV 
And there are also many other things that Jesus did , which if they were written one by one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written . Amen . http://bible.us/John21.25.NKJV 
And they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many who were sick , and healed them . http://bible.us/Mark6.13.NKJV 
Then He went up into the boat to them , and the wind ceased . And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure , and marveled . http://bible.us/Mark6.51.NKJV 
Wherever He entered , into villages , cities , or the country , they laid the sick in the marketplaces , and begged Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment . And as many as touched Him were made well . http://bible.us/Mark6.56.NKJV 
But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you ; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and to the end of the earth . ” http://bible.us/Acts1.8.NKJV 
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance . http://bible.us/Acts2.4.NKJV 
But as for you , you meant evil against me ; butGod meant it for good , in order to bring it about as it is this day , to save many people alive . http://bible.us/Gen50.20.NKJV 
At the command of the Lord they remained encamped , and at the command of the Lord they journeyed ; they kept the charge of the Lord , at the command of the Lord by the hand of < PROPMALE > . http://bible.us/Num9.23.NKJV 
Then < PROPFIRST > said , “Silver and gold I do not have , but what I do have I give you : In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , rise up and walk . ” http://bible.us/Acts3.6.NKJV 
And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up , and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength . http://bible.us/Acts3.7.NKJV 
So he , leaping up , stood and walked and entered the < PROPFEMALE > with them—walking , leaping , and praising God . http://bible.us/Acts3.8.NKJV 
let it be known to you all , and to all the people of < PROPMALE > , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , by Him this man stands here before you whole . http://bible.us/Acts4.10.NKJV

He said to them , “But who do you say that I am ? ”\ 
< PROPFIRST > answered and said to Him , “You are the Christ . ” http://bible.us/Mark8.29.NKJV 
When He had called the people to Himself , with His disciples also , He said to them , “Whoever desires to come after Me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow Me . http://bible.us/Mark8.34.NKJV 
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it . http://bible.us/Mark8.35.NKJV 
But < PROPFIRST > said to him , “Your money perish with you , because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money ! http://bible.us/Acts8.20.NKJV 
Now when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught < PROPMALE > away , so that the eunuch saw him no more ; and he went on his way rejoicing . http://bible.us/Acts8.39.NKJV 
I so love the opportunity to preach the gospel . Yesterday was a wonderful day for me . Remember to think about who is writing your story ! 
Pardon the iniquity of this people , I pray , according to the greatness of Your mercy , just as You have forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now . ” http://bible.us/Num14.19.NKJV 
Jesus said to him , “If you can believe , all things are possible to him who believes . ” http://bible.us/Mark9.23.NKJV 
So He said to them , “This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting . ” http://bible.us/Mark9.29.NKJV 
And He sat down , called the twelve , and said to them , “If anyone desires to be first , he shall be last of all and servant of all . ” http://bible.us/Mark9.35.NKJV 
If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to enter into life maimed , rather than having two hands , to go to hell , into the fire that shall never be quenched— http://bible.us/Mark9.43.NKJV 
And now , indeed , the hand of the Lord is upon you , and you shall be blind , not seeing the sun for a time . ” And immediately a dark mist fell on him , and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand . http://bible.us/Acts13.11.NKJV

but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols , fromsexual immorality , from things strangled , and from blood . http://bible.us/Acts15.20.NKJV 
Thus also faith by itself , if it does not have works , is dead . http://bible.us/Jas2.17.NKJV 
Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not to be so . http://bible.us/Jas3.10.NKJV 
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life a ransom for many . ” http://bible.us/Mark10.45.NKJV 
Then Jesus said to him , “Go your way ; your faith has made you well . ” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road . http://bible.us/Mark10.52.NKJV 
Adulterers and adulteresses ! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God . http://bible.us/Jas4.4.NKJV 
Therefore submit to God . Resist the devil and he will flee from you . http://bible.us/Jas4.7.NKJV 
whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away . http://bible.us/Jas4.14.NKJV 
Then the Lordopened Balaam’s eyes , and he saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand ; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face . http://bible.us/Num22.31.NKJV 
“God is not a man , that He should lie , Nor a son of man , that He should repent . Has He said , and will He not do ? Or has He spoken , and will He not make it good ? http://bible.us/Num23.19.NKJV 
so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick , and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them . http://bible.us/Acts19.12.NKJV 
Is anyone among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord . http://bible.us/Jas5.14.NKJV 
And the prayer of faith will save the sick , and the Lord will raise him up . And if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven . http://bible.us/Jas5.15.NKJV

For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified . http://bible.us/1Cor2.2.NKJV

But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be troubled ; for such things must happen , but the end is not yet . http://bible.us/Mark13.7.NKJV

There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who do not walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit . http://bible.us/Rom8.1.NKJV

You shall teach them diligently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , when you walk by the way , when you lie down , and when you rise up . http://bible.us/Deut6.7.NKJV 
Then Pilate said to them , “Why , what evil has He done ? ” But they cried out all the more , “Crucify Him ! ” http://bible.us/Mark15.14.NKJV 
So when the centurion , who stood opposite Him , saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last , he said , “Truly this Man was the Son of God ! ” http://bible.us/Mark15.39.NKJV

What is the conclusion then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will also pray with the understanding . I will sing with the spirit , and I will also sing with the understanding . http://bible.us/1Cor14.15.NKJV 
For God is not the author of confusion but of peace , as in all the churches of the saints . http://bible.us/1Cor14.33.NKJV 
Therefore , brethren , < PROPFEMALE > earnestly to prophesy , and do not forbid to speak with tongues . http://bible.us/1Cor14.39.NKJV 
Let all things be done decently and in order . http://bible.us/1Cor14.40.NKJV

clearly you are an epistle of Christ , ministered by us , written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh , that is , of the heart . http://bible.us/2Cor3.3.NKJV 
Now the Lord is the Spirit ; and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there isliberty . http://bible.us/2Cor3.17.NKJV 
We are hard-pressed on every side , yet not crushed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ; http://bible.us/2Cor4.8.NKJV 
persecuted , but not forsaken ; struck down , but not destroyed— http://bible.us/2Cor4.9.NKJV 
Therefore we do not lose heart . Even though our outward man is perishing , yet the inward man is being renewed day by day . http://bible.us/2Cor4.16.NKJV 
For our light affliction , which is but for a moment , is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of < PROPFEMALE > , http://bible.us/2Cor4.17.NKJV 
while we do not look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . For the things which are seen are temporary , but the things which are not seen are eternal . http://bible.us/2Cor4.18.NKJV

Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers . For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness ? And what communion has light with darkness ? http://bible.us/2Cor6.14.NKJV 
And what accord has Christ with Belial ? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever ? http://bible.us/2Cor6.15.NKJV 
And what agreement has the < PROPFEMALE > of God with idols ? For you are the < PROPFEMALE > of the living God . As God has said : “I will dwell in them And walk among them . I will be their God , And they shall be My people . ” http://bible.us/2Cor6.16.NKJV 
Therefore “Come out from among them And be separate , says the Lord . Do not touch what is unclean , And I will receive you . ” http://bible.us/2Cor6.17.NKJV

knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Christ Jesus , that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law ; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified . http://bible.us/Gal2.16.NKJV 
I have been crucified with Christ ; it is no longer I who live , but Christ lives in me ; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave Himself for me . http://bible.us/Gal2.20.NKJV 
And because you are sons , God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts , crying out , “Abba , Father ! ” http://bible.us/Gal4.6.NKJV
