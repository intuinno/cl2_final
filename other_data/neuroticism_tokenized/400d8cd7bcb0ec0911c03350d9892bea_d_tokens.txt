in super < PROPFIRST > brothers 3 , < PROPFEMALE > toadstool has once again been kidnapped by < PROPMALE > koopa . so if she's a prisoner , how come she has the freedom to mail items to < PROPFIRST > to help him find her ? and if she's going to send mail , why not a direct map to her location or a magic flute that will bring him to her so he can avoid all the obstacles ?

does anyone want a kitten ? a stray cat made itself at home in our garage and gave birth to five . 
i've learned three things recently : 1 : sometimes the people you trust the most are the most likely to let you down . 2 : my hatred of < PROPFEMALE > streep has only grown stronger with time . 3 : it's harder to find homes for stray kittens than i thought . 
the woman at the table next to me while i was waiting to pick up dinner was talking to her friend about how she needed to go pick up some monistat . ew .
