... wow ... Our math teacher , in 9th grade , told us that circles are divided into 360 degrees because 360 has plenty of factors . Out of boredom , I discovered that 360 has 23 factors ( at least 4 more than all smaller < PROPFIRST > ) ; then , out of curiosity , I discovered that the next smallest number with at least 23 factors is ... * drum-roll * ... can you guess it ? ... ... yeah , that's right : 420 .

Sometimes I can't tell whether I should sing or simply scream ... where does the compassion technically become grotesque , before bleeding into repulsion ?

Hypnopompic delirium , this morning , proved entertaining ... my bed was a wall to which I pressed my back , the foot of my bed was a narrow edge , and the wall beneath me acted as a three-story plunge into which I precariously peered . I woke from a dream of kleptomania in mall of skyscraper proportions , and trying to escape undetected . Does anyone else deal with shit like this , first thing in the morning , very often ?

My response : I have forgotten anger . Someone could hand me a knife , shoot me up with meth and PCP , kick me in the genitals and still expect me not to hurt them , but that's only because I once came to understand anger so well that I've transcended it . \

Like countless people from school , I wish I got to know you better . I'd STILL like to , but , also like too many people , you don't reply to many of my messages .

Woooah ... between homework and appointments , it seems I'm running out of time for FaceBook ... is this a sign of the Apocalypse ?...

If not the #1 , you're certainly a close runner up among the most enlightened people I've ever encountered . You really roiled me , though , a couple years ago , when proclaiming of some activist ( feminist ? ) who said that the most empowering act she'd ever accomplished was putting on weight . Maybe it's because I loath the personality I embodied back when I was fat , but frugality still enthralls me ... 
#222 \ 
Oh my ... I haven't seen you in years . In all likelihood , you'll wrongly assume what I'm about to say has been told to several females , but you're the most physically attractive woman I've ever met ... or , at least you were ; I can't be sure , since it's been so long , but your personality was pretty pretty too , so I still wish we'd get to spend more time together . Leave off the beer ; < PROPFEMALE > toward psychedelics . ;D

I recall having an epic conversation with you , back in 2006 , right before I dove into my dark age ... for the life of me , though , I can't recall what it was about ; and I believe it took place on MySpace , which has forsaken me , so I can't recover it . We haven't spoken much since we reconnected after my abysmal trip , so I don't have much to say , but I'd like to know you better if you feel the same .

You quite possibly qualify as one of two or three people with whom I've maintained contact , who I can safely say seem more eccentric than I am . I mean that in the most loving way possible , though ; we're fans of oddities , you know how that goes ... I hope your suicidal stream of thought can come to closure , and would like to remind you that the Abyss is at least as uninviting as this plane is , for sure .

You've always felt like the closest I've had to a brother , and your perfect sense of serenity and humor have undoubtedly inspired me on occasion , throughout the years .

Despite the risk of creeping you out , I'd like to let you know that I daily dreamt of confessing my eternal adoration of you , for the first year I spent , here , in Indiana . I've always wondered whether it gave an odd vibe , and didn't understand how such a scenario could make someone uncomfortable until my senior year ... regardless , you're happily married , now , and I hope that goes divinely for you . 
Is anyone else experiencing lots of broken image links , on FaceBook , in people's profile icons ? I've also had issues with FB telling me that I've successfully posted a comment , then checking back on the post later to find that it wasn't added ; even when the post was of my own , so no one else could have deleted it ... WTF ? Perhaps it's the gov't VS Anonymous wars wiping up a cybernetic storm ... 
OOOoooh ... sweet acetyl-choline , forgive me for letting my enzymes mercilessly degrade you for so many years ... does anyone else find it odd that people are all about buying shit like alcohol and cigarettes , while drugs which are proven to improve cognition go ignored ?

How ought we discern between people's claims of real benevolence , and the possibility that their actions are merely a distorted and deceiving pursuit of self-interest which merely happens to benefit others ?
