I need to break something ... 

My phone has finally succumbed to death . But now I don't have a phone to use !! 
Could you guys give me your phone < PROPFIRST > , please ? I don't have them on my phone anymore . :/ 
I got kicked out of Wal-Mart by the manager for promoting zombie awareness and warning people of the zombie apocalypse . I bet he was a zombie ... >.> 
I was going to make cookies but then I realized that I have no flour . This upsets me . >:( 
Hamsters look really gross when they're wet . 
I got a new phone ! :D 
Happy Earth Day ! :D 
People can really disgust me sometimes . 
Flyleaf or Bullet for my < PROPFIRST > ? Which concert shall I go to ? 
is going to Bullet for My < PROPFIRST>'s concert . :D 
My ears are ringing and I'm bruised , but the concert last night was worth it . :) 
I < PROPMALE > out with a group of girls for the first time in two years . It was weird . There was so much giggling .. 
Why did he have to show up ? 
I think I FINALLY got a tan . :D 
Does anyone know how to pick a deadbolt lock ? The key that's supposed to open my mailbox isn't working because my mailbox is being an ( insert vulgar language here ) and it won't let me have my package . D:< 
Awkard moments .... Zack , you really should put on more clothes before addressing my friends .

As of today I have been vegetarian for a year . :) 
I love nature . <3 
Going to my cousin's house tonight , then going to Utah Lake tomorrow . :) 
I got the breed of dog I've been looking for forever , I rode a horse again for the first time in two years , I've almost resolved an issue that's been plaguing me for quite some time , and I'm going to Warped Tour tomorrow . This week has been good . :) 
Warped Tour was excellent . :) 
Wow . After a week I think I've finally decided on a name for my dog . He's been dubbed : Zuko . Though I'm still not satisfied with the name ... :/ 
I feel like a better person after I drink tea .

I got my magic rocks in the mail today . :D 
I hate fat ladies and their stupid little rat dogs . >:( 
Seriously ? Nightmare on 13th was voted as one of the scariest haunted attractions in < PROPFEMALE > by the Travel Network ? Animatronics are NOT scary . Neither are actors who don't know how to do anything but growl . The line was more intense than the actual house . I am very disappointed . >:(

I feel like acid has been poured down my throat . 
Just found out why Ninjas are so badass .
