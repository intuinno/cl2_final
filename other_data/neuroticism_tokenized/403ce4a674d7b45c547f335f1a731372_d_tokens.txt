Greetings to the world of facebook . 

For those of you who have always wondered what exactly it is I'm talking about when I talk about archery or WWII reenacting , you can now see some pictures in my \Various pictures\ " album . " 
Just won NFAA Nationals in the crossbow division . 
Thanks to everybody for wishing me a happy birthday yesterday ! 
Just got back from orientation . It was a wirlwind , but it turned out pretty well . It feels good to have all my courses sheduled and to officially be a cadet in the Air Force ROTC . Got a new computer too , so that's pretty neat . 
The first scoring rounds of the U.S.A. Archery Nationals happen today . Wish me luck . 
Well , all moved in and unpacked . My dorm room is quite excellent and everything has gone really well so far . 
I ate a $32 steak at the Blackwell ! Good thing I had meal swipes to burn before the quarter ends .
