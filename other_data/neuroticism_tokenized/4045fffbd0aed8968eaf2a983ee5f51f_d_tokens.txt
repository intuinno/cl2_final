Just one of those days that makes you think that you should never have left your bed in the first place 
playing \vrum-vrum-beep-beep\ " with < PROPMALE >..." 
gorgeous out and of course I have to go to work only to find an empty restaurant and 15 servers on ... 
the search is over ! Got my own place ! Mov 
Plymouth for the day ... 
is talking to my mom 
Donavon Frankenreiter anyone ? Have an extra ticket , tomorrow at 8pm in Boston , bought 3 tix , one of my girlfriends can't go ... Paid $33 for it .

i meant hooked ... whatever ... lol 
loving the weather , going to the beach later ... 
48 hours without a cigarette :)

FB at it again .. Wondering why you're only seeing status updates from the same people ? Facebook has changed its News Feed so that by default you can only see updates from people you have recently interacted with ! To change this click the arrow next to ' most recent ' then \edit options\ " and tick the box to receive updates from ALL friends . Most importantly - repost this ! Only a few of your friends will actually see it ! " 
has anybody seen the < PROPFEMALE > ? Gorgeous !

I figured out why I'm fat ! The shampoo I use in the shower that runs down my body says \For extra volume and body\ " . I'm going to start using \ " Dawn\ " dish soap .

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . Put this as your status if you're against bullying ..... Take a Stand Against Bullying !
