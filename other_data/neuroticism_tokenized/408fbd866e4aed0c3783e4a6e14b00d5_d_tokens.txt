Remember that happiness is a way of travel , not a destination . - < PROPFIRST > Goodman 
Never be afraid to laugh at yourself , after all , you could be missing out on the joke of the century . 
So ya Essaf can suck it . I want to see the damn bitch's face when i turn in a paper that sounds like the guy who writes the presidents speeches did it for me . She acts like the topic matters when i could've written just a good of a paper on Crayons vs . Markers : which is the best for kids to color with . 
Those who wish to sing , always find a song =] 
So I can honestly say that tonight was one of the funnest practices I've been to :) 
The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief . 
Talent is formed in solitude , chracter in the bustle of the world . 
Money doesn't buy happiness ? It buys a wave runner . You've never seen someone frowning on one of those now have ya ? 
Got bit by a moose with donuts on its antlers today . 
Another night that I just can't sleep =/ 
If your going through hell , keep going . 
You just lost The Game . 
We acquire strength we have overcome .

Montreal by Kaki < PROPMALE > look it up . 
A candle can be the brightest thing in a dark room . Only once you turn the lights on do realize just how small that flame was . 
Just realized that his iPod can process faster than his actual computer . 
Life is a shipwreck , but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats . 
I think I liked saints 2 better than the first . 
You miss 100% of the shots you never take . 
Birds sing after a storm ; why shouldn't people feel as free to delight in whatever remains to them ? 
Everyone pray to god I get this job !!

Human beings are the only species that can and will logically talk themselves out of making the right desicion . 
When cheese gets it's picture taken what does it say ? And why do we say heads up when your supposed to duck ? 
A good friend helps you when you fall ... \ 
But a best friend laughs trips you again and continues to laugh 
Question : Why isn't the number 11 pronounced onety one ?

Let me be the one who calls You baby all the time , \ 
Surely You can take some comfort knowing that your mine , \ 
Just hold me tight , \ 
Lay by my side , \ 
And let me be the one who calls You baby all the time ..

Really good book :) I'd say if you want a romance novel that doesn't include the words vampire or werewolf , then read Beastly . 
Of course . 
Loves running in the rain ! until it threatens to damage my iPod . And hates injured knees . 
\He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man . \""

Laugh your heart out , dance I'm the rain , < PROPFEMALE > the moment , ignore the pain , live laugh love , forgive and forget , life's to short to be living with regrets :) 
Bunk that . Geometry can kiss my Angle-Side-Side . 
This is 10% luck , 20% skill , 15% concentrated power of will , 5% pleasure , 50% game and 100% reason to remember the name .

The club can't even handle me right now ! :) 
Had a blast at homecoming ! :) 
Bed so comfy .. :) sleepy time for this guy . Night all ! 
Talk about being bored 
I've realized lately that the minute you start to envy the happiness of others is also the moment you lose sight of your own . Happiness is not something to acheive but the mode in which you opperate . It can't come from something or someone you don't have but simply from not regretting whats done , enjoying what you have , and taking pride in everywhere you can go , it comes from simply indulging in the thing itself 
bongdebongdedangdedangdiggydiggy ! =] 
Doesn't feel good :| 
Got to see the softball game :) thought we did pretty good although I wish I could've actually cheered them on . Sore throats suck :/ 
Hates being sore from weights and being sick on top of that :( 
Pimpin pimpin pimpin :) 
Doesn't want to go to the game and have to get up in the morning too =/ 
I believe in nothing\ 
Not the end and not the start\ 
Not the earth and not the stars\ 
Not the day and not the dark\ 
But the beating of our hearts\ 
One hundred suns until we part\ 
Not in satan , not in god\ 
Not in peace and not in war\ 
But the truth of who we are 
Singin along to some < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > :) 
Just got a haircut :) 
It's cold ! :) lol wish I had brought my jacket for that little walk 
A long ass fucking time ago in a town called Kickapoo .. :)

The sun shines and warms and lights us and we have no curiosity to know why this is so ; but we ask the reason of all evil , of pain , and hunger , and mosquitoes and silly people :) 
Who's an idiot ?! This guy !! Fml . 
Shoot me now .

Music is like magic , \ 
There's a certain feeling you get when you real and you spit and people feeling your shit :o

No apologies . 
Good lord ! She stayed the night and now I have to hear that shit as I wake up . 
I wish I could live in Albion :) 
Boring fucking break . 
You know a game is good when you haven't eaten all day without realizing it :) 
They should combine hunting and monster truck rallying and NASCAR into one huge redneck Olympics ! \ 
Batman&Batgirl :) 
But it was just a dream , \ 
Just a moment ago , \ 
I was up so high , looking down at the sky , \ 
Don't let me fall :) 
Infuriating . Great day , then she came and ruined it .

All I want for Christmas is to smack a ho ! \ 
Credits to < PROPMALE > lol 
Needs to get out of the fucking house for once 
Gaaah ! Retard laugh >:[ 
Chinese for dinner ? Ya ! :D 
1 : a pause from doing something ( as work)\ 
2 : the act of breaking something\ 
Well seeing as how wasson has denied me the first definition I fear I shall resort to the second :) 
Pie or pizza for lunch ? 
Here we go , \ 
Come with me , \ 
There's a world out there that we should see , \ 
Take my hand , close your eyes , \ 
With you right here I'm a rocketeer , \ 
Let's flyyyyyy ! :D 
Bored . Who wants to < PROPFEMALE > ?! :) 
How many pop ups can occur upon start up of your computer before you can justify breaking your computer ? 
What should I get for dinner !? 
>:[ 
Loves snow ! :D 
Hell ya ! Yet another day at home doing a whole lotta nothing :D

People killin ' , people dyin'\ 
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'\ 
Can you practice what you preach\ 
And would you turn the other cheek\ 
Father , Father , Father help us\

Just made some delicious hash browns for lunch :) 
And i promise you kid , i'll give so much more than i get . I just haven't met you yet =] 
Sometimes we fall down , can't get back up\ 
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough\ 
How come we don't say I love you enough\ 
Till it's to late , it's not too late\ 
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come\ 
And we could make a feast from these crumbs\ 
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun\ 
So if your life flashed before you , \ 
What would you wish you would've done ? 
99 problems 
Wow ! 2 hour delay tomorrow ?!? Wondering if I should waste the time . 
There's no combination of words I can put on the back of a post card , no song that I could could sing but I can try for your heart :) 
In the end it will be the what ifs that you really regret 
I believe in memories\ 
They look so , so pretty when I sleep\ 
Hey now , and when I wake up , \ 
You look so pretty sleeping next to me\ 
But there is not enough time , \ 
And there is no , no song I could sing\ 
And there is no , combination of words I could say\ 
But I will still tell you one thing\ 
We're better together :) 
I will never get tired of that song <3 :) 
With only two\ 
Just me and you\ 
Not so many things we got to do\ 
Or places we got to be\ 
We'll Sit beneath the mango tree :) 
Oh I just can wait to be < PROPMALE > ! :D

Love is not about finding the perfect person , its about finding an imperfect person who you see perfectly :) 
He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man .
