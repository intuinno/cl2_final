I love the way it looks outside when it snows at night <3 
I hate having random food cravings when I'm not allowed to eat anything until at least 11 am tomorrow >.< 
Feeling gross .. most likely being lazy for the rest of the day because thanks to the two feet of snow , I'm pretty much stranded here 
I'm seriously under the impression that since all of the kids who go to school in Brick are on break right now , the public facilities people think its okay to take their time plowing all of the side streets here 
The snow is awesome .. just not when there's three feet of it , your town still hasn't plowed your street , and your house is running out of food when there wasn't that much food there to begin with 
I think its pretty sad that some of my neighbors decided to take it upon themselves to plow the street before the town did , but whatever .. I'm not stranded anymore =] 
Being a lazy bum , as always .. well , when I'm home from school at least 
Spending the last day of the year watching a House marathon ? Sounds pretty good to me =] 
Now that the holidays are over , part of me REALLY wants to be back at school =/ 
Keep this going !! Heavenly Father , as we embark upon this a new year , walk through my home and take away all my worries and any illnesses ; and please watch and protect my family and friends .

Friends can help each other . A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel . Or , not feel . Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them . That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is . [ Jim Morrison ] 
Stick-building Rush event , e-board , then going out to Applebee's with the birthday girl and some other cool people =] 
I'm quite sure that you'll tell me , just how I should feel today .

Ughhh .. yet ANOTHER group project -____- 
Hey , you know they're all the same . You know you're doing better on your own , so don't buy in . Live right now , yeah , just be yourself . It doesn't matter if it's good enough , for someone else . 
CORE tonight was really good and the comments that people made about me during the hot seat game were really inspiring , especially since I haven't totally been feeling like myself lately 
The Lord is my strength and shield . I trust him with all my heart . He helps me , and my heart is filled with joy . I burst out in songs of thanksgiving . http://bible.us/Ps28.7.NLT 
I just found out that my aunt's dog who she had since I was six had to be put to sleep a few days ago , so I'm kinda sad .. but I really like the < PROPFIRST>'s presents my grandma gave me =] 
For those of you who believe in prayer , please pray for me . I just haven't been feeling like myself since this semester started and its honestly starting to scare me

He alone is my rock and my salvation , \ 
my fortress where I will not be shaken . http://bible.us/Ps62.6.NLT 
Going to InterVarsity's Social Justice Q and A Night , then some cool stuffs with APO =]

Spending the rest of the night studying , yay college .. 
Ughh .. second time not feeling well has kept me from going to a weekend-long event . I guess God and my body are telling me I need to relax 
Still mentally recovering from one of the scariest panic attacks I've ever had =/ 
Glad I got to relax all day , but I'm deff not looking forward to all of the homework and studying I have to do tomorrow =/ 
Let your unfailing love surround us , Lord , for our hope is in you alone . http://bible.us/Ps33.22.NLT 
Okay , so my Comm Law exam wasn't as bad as I thought it would be , but I'd definitely rather be sleeping than sitting through class 
I'll tell you once more , before I get off the floor .. don't bring me dowwwnnn !! 
What shall we say about such wonderful things as these ? If God is for us , who can ever be against us ? http://bible.us/Rom8.31.NLT 
But as for me , how good it is to be near God ! I have made the Sovereign Lord my shelter , and I will tell everyone about the wonderful things you do . http://bible.us/Ps73.28.NLT 
ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . Too many to mention have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends and family 
Hey Rider girls !! Do any of you who plan on living in premium housing next year need a roommate ? If so , definitely let me know =]

So freaking tired . Meeting at 5 , then doing an insane amount of homework 
As much as I hate waking up early on Sunday mornings , I really need to start going to church again ..

Whether life's disabilities have left you outcast , bullied , or teased .. rejoice and love yourself today , ' cause baby you were born this wayyy ! 
I just want to say that even though the semester is almost over and there's only so much time left , I think its a little ridiculous for a certain professor of mine to have us take an exam on Good Friday -____- 
Second to last night class of the semester . Let's do this .. 
My roommate really needs to stop humming because its creepy enough to listen to when it isn't 1 am .. 
Your unfailing love , O Lord , is as vast as the heavens ; your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds . http://bible.us/Ps36.5.NLT 
Though they stumble , they will never fall , for the Lord holds them by the hand . http://bible.us/Ps37.24.NLT 
Watching The Passion of the Christ for the first time since I saw it in theaters <3 
Greatest man in history , named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master . Had no degree , yet they called him Teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called him Healer . He had no army , yet kings feared Him . He won no military battles , yet He conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him ..... He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . Re-post if you believe with your heart 
And he saith unto them , Be not amazed : ye seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who hath been crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold , the place where they laid him ! [ Mark 16:1 <3 ] 
We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us . So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters . http://bible.us/1John3.16.NLT 
I really hate exams , like .. a LOT 
Okay , time to finally start working on my AMS paper ! 
I love how my professor took the exact essay question for his assignment off of SparkNotes .. 
21 in exactly ONE month !!!!! 
I love that my roommate also loves Jesus Christ Superstar , but if she keeps humming and singing along to it I'm gonna end up going crazy 
Thanks to the wrap I ate for dinner tonight , my stomach feels gross and I have no < PROPFEMALE > to do any of the work I need to get done , ughhh 
Trying to calm myself down so I don't totally freak out .. but on the bright side , I'm totally finished with Advanced Publication Design !!!

Carah Charnow is back in Shiny Toy Guns .. I'm so freaking happy !!!! 
If I could forget certain events of this day for the rest of my life , that would be amazing .. 
I'm not afraid , of anything in this world . There's nothing you can throw at me , that I haven't already heard . I'm just trying to find , a decent < PROPFEMALE > . A song that I can sing , in my own company <3

Happy Mother's Day to all of the amazing mommies out there , especially mine who I get to see tomorrow !!! <3 
I am SO not focused on writing a paper and studying right now . This is definitely not good .. 
Listening to one of my suitemates talk about how gross everyone else in the suite is is making me feel even BETTER about living in a double-single next year =] 
is now only one final away from the end of the semester . Let's do this ! 
This really was a great semester and Im kinda sad to see it end , but Im not gonna lie .. it feels so good to be home !!
