< PROPMALE > is up and around with a cast & crutches . He goes for a check on Tuesday . He had 3 hours of surgery on list left foot . 2 plates with 8 screws to fix his catastrophic foot collapse . If this doesn't work , then it's total fusion of those area's and he'll have very limited motion . He cannot move his foot side to side already , so we are hoping this will work and get rid of his pain . 

Typical < PROPMALE > , he can't stand being cooped up & god forbid he can't be up & around . He's already wanting to go back to work which he won't be able to do for 6-8 weeks . It hasn't even been a week yet ! He has such a high tolerance for pain , the doc said he can't imagine how he was even walking on it let alone working on it all day & then playing basketball daily as well . 
He drives me crazy , but I love him so much . He's such a good man ! I wish I could show him to all those Doc's from birth on who gave me such limiting outlooks for him . He's having the last laugh at them ! We joke with him that he's a walking birth defect , but he's over come all of them ! 
Off to return some doubles of xmas gifts , pick up Madi's B-Day cake & then off to family dinner to celebrate Madi's B-day . We got her a guitar on her actual bday ( 12/31 ) and she already can play 6 simple nursery rhyme type songs , all from watching a utube how-to video . I'm thinking guitar lessons are in our future ! 
Ok , who ever got me hooked on that Farkle game , I LOVE you and I HATE you ! MUST PLAY ....... 
Madi's Volleyball Tourny starts at 7:30 in the morning ..... what a LONG day this will be .

Whatever you give a woman , she will make greater , give her sperm she will make a baby , give her a house she will give you a home , give her groceries she will give you a meal , give her a smile she will give you her heart .

It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children -made in a unique way and who learn a little ..... differently . 
TODAY = HELL ON EARTH !!! I cannot do this anymore . I'm just so .......... so ............ wiped out . see more ....

I know they can take it with 2 more and win in New York , but part of me wants to see them win it here . OK , nope , TAKE IT TO THEM RANGERS , RIGHT IN THEIR HOUSE !!! 
If you don't know the story behind < PROPMALE > Hamilton , you should take the time to look it up . When the Rangers won the Western Division Title , < PROPMALE > didn't participate in the celebration iven his substance abuse . C.J. < PROPMALE > ( doesn't drink alcohol ) set up a < PROPFEMALE > Ale celebration so < PROPMALE > could celebrate with the team ! That speaks volumes of these players & this team . LOVE IT !!! 
Vote to keep < PROPFIRST > Massey & < PROPFEMALE > Schwimmer dancing on ABC ! \ 
PLEASE send prayers & good thoughts my families way . My mom's < PROPFIRST > died 2 days ago , Krina's car died the same day & < PROPFEMALE > had a wreck & her car died on Sunday . I'm afraid to even go near our car ! SO , if anyone knows of a few really good cars for a REALLY cheap price .... LOL ! Also , if your looking to buy 2 fixer uppers for cheap ... LOL !! 
OK life ..... ENOUGH !!! I'm ready to be done . I'm ready to just have a moment of quiet , peace & tranquility . I feel like I'm on a different planet wandering around in circles & not knowing even where to start , how to start , what to start or do I really want to start ? LOL ! 
Our Rangers , who < PROPMALE > in Texas , Winners be \ 
thy name . The Yanks will come , they will be done , in New York as they \ 
will in Texas . Give us this day , a series win , and forgive us our losses\ 
by the bullpen and lead us not into the off season after this series , \ 
but deliver us a Championship to Texas . For the Rangers shall be the \ 
... 2010 ALDS , ALCS , and World Series Champions forever and ever .. 
Just when you think it's bad enough , I heard my Mom was in a wreck in < PROPMALE>'s ( brother-in-law ) car ! I don't know the details , but it wasn't serious . So now they too are down a car ! Then , Krina is SO sick ! PLEASE , my rope is almost out , the light is dimming at the end of the tunnel , my cup runneth over about 2 weeks ago , my shoulders are not that broad nor strong ! I'm staying in the house & nowhere near a car ! 
My poor Krina is SO sick ! 101 fever , throwing up , hurting , she went to work , but she started throwing up so they sent her home . She's an emotional WRECK right now , no car , no $$ for another car , personal stuff . My poor baby , last night I just held her in my arms while she sobbed . I told her your never too old to want your Mommy to hold you in her arms . As a matter of fact , I called my Mom & sobbed to her last night too ! 
4 AWAY TO THE WORLD SERIES BABY !!!!!!! GO RANGERS !! GO RANGERS !! 
< PROPFIRST > is going to sit Jeter down ! 
HELLO WIN COLUMN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE YA RANGERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Gingeral Ale for < PROPMALE > & all the Rangers !! Truly an amazing show of team spirit & togetherness . Maybe the Cowboys should watch & learn from the TEXAS RANGERS !!!

LOVE this weather ! Enjoying watching my birds at the feeder & the pigeons under it pecking at the ground . My doggies are curled up in bed with me while I catch up on some DVR shows , < PROPFIRST > is playing his game so I get to hear him yell and shoot people & the girls are out shopping for my bday present . Ahhh ...... life is good . Please don't let the pain and/or nausea hit today !!! 
Hmmm .... so when Romo is better & ready to come back , do you put him back in or do you stay with Kitna ? 
GO COWBOYS !!! WOOOOO HOOOOO ! It sure is fun to watch them having fun again . It has to be a little sad for Coach Phillips . Seeing them do SO good after you leave . Liked the guy , just not the coach . He was way to soft on everyone . The players seem to respect Coach < PROPMALE > & in turn , they play much better . He demands respect , he gives respect & boy does it show ! 
Went to the Dr. yesterday , monthly check . < PROPMALE > nausea & weight loss issues . Got there & my blood pressure was 77/46 & heart rate was 113 . Did STAT bloodwork & my blood count was really low . I went next store to the hospital & got a blood transfusion which brought my < PROPFIRST > up . So having to take it super easy , change meds & see how #'s go . Possible colitis flare or ulcer could be causing the bleeding . Not a fun day . 
Well , woke up today after I slept for a LONG time , which is weird for me , but I'll take it ! So went into the bathroom & was getting ready to flush & clean my feeding tube & when I looked down , my bandage around my tube was covered with blood . Well , guess we know where the bleeding is coming from now . 
UGH , started throwing up quite abit of blood . On my way to Baylor now .... will this ever end !! 
I was admitted to Roberts room 1520 . I got 2 pints of plasma & vitamin K shot . IV meds & talk w/ doc's in the AM . Gastro dye in remnant stomach , maybe fistula ? 
Still at Baylor . Put a 2nd IV into my arm pit today . OUCH !! Went to radiology and did an upper GI & a small bowel follow thru . The upper GI showed that I do have that blind loop or divertucum in my stomach . Radiologist has to read it on the special machine & get his/her report . My < PROPFIRST > are all in the super low or deficient end of the scale , so i'm here for at least a few days . YUCK !! 
Well , contrast from the upper GI clogged my feeding tube , so they are trying to unclog it so I can use it . Once I can get 2 feeds in , I get to go home !! They did finally put a picc line in last night . OMG , I have 30 needle pokes in me since Sat @ 7 PM . I had an IV in my wrist on the side & one in my arm pit ! I'm exhausted , I'm going to take a nap . Thanks for all the good wishes & kind words . We'll see how it goes . 
WOO HOO !!! PICC line is in !!! So no more poking me . Well , that's not true , I still have to get B-12 shots in my arm daily & a Luvenox shot in my tummy daily , but it's still 1000 times better . The pain med's were upped today & the feeding tube was unclogged of the CT contrast . Tube feedings start tonight , so I'm pretty nervous about that , but it's a step closer to going home . 
The BEST NEWS : NO more talk about putting me in ICU !! I'll update more & feel free to post here , email me or stop by . Warning : I'm MRSA positive , so you have to gown & glove up to get into my room & you can't be sick at all . Thanks everyone for all your prayers , good thoughts & for making me smile & laugh . It makes this alot easier . 
The pain behind the belly button , well , there is no way I can handle an operation , so I will just have to deal with it . Didn't really want to up the pain med's , but I may not have a choice . My sister brought me a cute tinsel tree & I have it set up . Everyone loves it & wants to know where they can get one ! I'm hoping all , or at least most , of my family can come see me this weekend . Starting to get pretty lonely here . 
You will NEVER guess who my nurse is tonight ..... < PROPFEMALE > !! Ok , well not THAT one , but her name is < PROPFEMALE > . Can you tell I'm getting punch drunk from being in the hospital ? LOL !! I'm SO ready to go home . We'll see what the day brings . Please continue to pray , wish , hope & keep good thoughts going my way . I really appreciate the kind words & the well wishes . Thanks ! 
Home sweet home !! I slept for 13 hours straight . 
My incredible neice , < PROPFIRST > Winterroth was nominated for Teacher of the Year !!! We are so proud of you & no matter what , your students know you are the teacher of the year EVERY YEAR for them ! 
I'm sleepy & tired ! I am so proud of myself . 4th day home & I walked the doggies for 20 minutes , raked & swept leaves up for 20 minutes & did paperwork for 20 minutes today . I made plans to hit a store tonight , but about 6:30 , the fatigue & pain were reminding me why I'm supposed to go easy , duh ! So I ended up staying right here & watching 2 episodes of Law & Order , SVU ! 
Well I hit the mall tonight for Xmas shopping . It was the first time I have been out since I got out of the hospital . Not crazy crowded which was so nice . I found a new shop that I love their stuff ! I managed to not buy a single present . I did buy some white chocolate though !! LOL !! 
I ate 5 bites tonight at dinner & promptly threw everything back up before we even left for home . About 10 minutes after we got home , I started vomiting again ! It's been on & off since then & it's now 4:33 AM !! HOW can there be ANYTHING left to get rid of when I only ate 5 bites of food ? Not to mention the number it does on my torn stomach muscles , feeding tube site & throat . No blood this time . OH THE PAIN !

Kentucky just passed the best law ever . To be on Food Stamps , Medicaid or Cash Assistance for your children or yourself , you have to pass a Drug Test . Now every other state should do the same . If you agree repost . People that work have to take a drug test , so should they . Repost if you agree that this should go national ! 
Here is a question . If you and your girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife switched phones and Facebook profiles for 24 hrs would you still have a relationship ?

Well , we pulled it off ! < PROPFEMALE>'s ( my sister ) suprise 50th birthday party went off without her even getting a hint of what we were doing ! We had about 45 people there & a barbershop quartet that she knows came all dressed up in their tuxes & sang Happy Birthday to her . Then they sang another song to her & to all the ladies they sang Let me call you sweetheart ! Good food , good fun , good time , GREAT family . 
We had an interesting Valentines Day/night . < PROPFIRST > came home from work in pain , so he layed down to see if it helped , but it just got worse . So after asking him for 2 hrs to go to ER , he relented & went . He hasn't been to a dr. in 20 yrs ! He has gallstones & will need to have his gallbladder removed . So we spent our night 7:30 - 11:00 in Lewisville Medical Center's ER . They were GREAT by the way ! Love you < PROPFEMALE > !

I am just so SICK of this !!! Feeding tube got infected , that I can handle . Feeding tube starts to hurt at a 8 to 9 level & I can't walk upright , I can deal with until I can call the Dr. on Monday . Waking up in a pool or blood because your feeding tube fell out of INSIDE me , CAN'T HANDLE !!!! Guess where I'm gonna be on Monday .... 
Went to Baylor to get feeding tube put back in me . All tests came back as expected , infection at tube site , tube was totally out , no parts left inside me . 8 hours later , out comes a new feeding tube , told me the ever popular , yet total bullsh*t , this may be a bit uncomfortable , & shoved that tube right back into the hole & right into my intestines . Yes , it was a BIT UNCOMFORTABLE ! I'm home , so it's all good .
