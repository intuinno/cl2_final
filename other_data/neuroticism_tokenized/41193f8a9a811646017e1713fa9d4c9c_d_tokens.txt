Got a secret\ 
Can you keep it ? \ 
Swear this one you'll save\ 
Better lock it , in your pocket\ 
Taking this one to the grave\ 
If I show you then I know you\ 
Won't tell what I said\ 
Cause two can keep a secret\ 
If one of them is dead 
Another reason why I named my kitten Spaz , she chases the arrow on the monitor whenever I move it :) 
Passed the HSPE in Reading and Writing both with advanced scores and then I missed passing the Math by 8 points grrr >:/

Wow : the stupid like , dislike , confession , and first impression thing is really starting to get annoying cuz that's all that pops up on my screen now . 
Braces off in a month :D <3 
Tell me what you want to hear\ 
Something that were like those years\ 
Sick of all the insincere\ 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away\ 
This time , don't need another perfect lie\ 
Don't care if critics never jump in line\ 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away <3

Got the bottom braces off today , now I just have to wait until Sept . 30 to get the rest off . 
Time turns flames to embers , \ 
You'll have new Septembers , \ 
Every one of us has messed up , too , \ 
Minds change like the weather , \ 
I hope you remember , \ 
Today is never too late , \ 
To be brand new\
