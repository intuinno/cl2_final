I think November 3rd might be a little early for Christmas music . ? _ ? Combine this with Pokemon , and it's definitely a little weird . 

Today was lots of fun actually . I think I might be addicted to Starbuck's hot apple cider now too . * w * 
That was quite possibly the saddest movie I've seen in a really really long time . 
can tell it's near the end of the semester . Suddenly all of those projects and papers that are due near the end are creeping up like zombies . Slow but deadly in large < PROPFIRST > . >,< 
HAPPY THANKSGIVING ! ? ( ????? ) ? Escaped the kitchen long enough to watch the parade for a few minutes and to say hi . XD 
thinks today was a good day . Nice and simple and no stress ~ Plus lunch with Mom is always nice . Now for that paper ... > M < I shall defeat it tonight . No more procrastination . The sketchbook is another thing entirely however . 
Glasses are funny . XD 
thinks she really likes finals week . There is essentially nothing to do all week , and there's actually parking . Awesome Sauce . 
thinks ' Patton ' is the greatest soundtrack to finish wrapping presents to , well interesting at least . > w < Seriously < PROPFIRST > Goldsmith I love you <3 
is jealous of all of you in < PROPMALE > City and stuff . She didn't get ANY snow where she's at , and she's only two hours south . / , \\;; 
SNOW !!! It'd finally snowed here ! 
I love how in my happiness for snow the English language escaped me once again * facepalm * 
Yay , back in the apartment . Now to get everything back in order before the new semester messes it back up again . 
Thanks everybody ! I had a wonderful day , and your notes really helped make it even better !
