Does anyone know what it should cost to have an alternator replaced ( on a 2002 VW Passat ) or just in general ? The place is telling me it will cost around $650-$750- does this sound right ?

Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
Of course the DMV is closed today and Monday for Lee-Jackson-King days . Why didn't I think of that ... Silly me !
