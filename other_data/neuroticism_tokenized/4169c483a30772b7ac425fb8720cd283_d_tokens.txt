They\ 
say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking & \ 
never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just \ 
spoke yesterday regardless of how long it has been or how far away they \ 
live and don’t hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but that\ 
... you will always love them ! Re-post if ... you have at least one friend \ 
like this ... I am privileged to say I do ..
