Mr. Barnish is definitely the reason I am in band . 
Do apush homework ? Nah .

Haunted houses are actually pretty fun when you walk through with your eyes closed !

Going to practice my clarinet for the first time in a looooong time ! 
Got locked out of the house with a pack of howling coyotes and the biggest spider I have ever seen . 
Too much homework for one night . 
Poor < PROPFIRST > Sumner . 
3+4 = 8 :p 
Does not particularly enjoy history . 
English test , apush quiz , precalc test , Spanish quiz , chair test , and lab report . Then finally , time to feast on turkey and pie ! :D

One .... More .... Day ..... : l 
Whoooo ! winter break , baby ! 
Today after guard tryouts I went to walgreens and a man chewed me out for wearing shorts during the winter . It was kind of awkward . 
sleeping while your dad and brother are watching football is next to impossible . Might as well get on facebook . 
Sushi is sooooo good ! 
5 lb ankle weights !!! Welcome back , soccer muscle . 
Had a very nice < PROPMALE > Christmas :) 
Has been playing dance central alllllll day ! 
Spent the day exploring eastland mall with the cousins , and only spent $25 ! 
This school year really just needs to end . 
\ Stop freaking betraying me I'm on your team !!! \"" 
Is VERY nervous ! 
Winter formal is apparently in like , 3 weeks . Crazy . 
Caffeine makes any amount of homework possible . 
I attempted to do my apush packet while laying in bed , listening to soft classical music . Of course , I fell asleep . 
These gravity stretch things KILL ! 
Bruises are so distracting ! 
Is sooo burnt out on school . 
FOUR DAYS of FREEDOM !!! :D 
Too lazy to get out of bed , turn of lights , clean up , and lock the door . This is what happens when your parents fall asleep before your friends leave . 
Has nothing to do today ... Weird . 
Unicorns , I love them . Unicorns , I love them . Uni uni unicorns , I love them . Uni unicorns , I could pet one if they were really real . And they are ! So I bought one so I could pet it . Now it loves me , now I love it . La < PROPFEMALE > la la ... 
Is pretty darn good at hammering nails into the wall with a high heel ! 
Life has been pretty boring lately . Eat , sleep , school . 
Gotta love dollar tree . 
Hah , career interests ? Noooo idea . 
Dangit , bears . 
Why , yes , of course I am wearing pijamas to school tomorrow ! 
If apush was replaced with pe , and precalc didn't involve brainless homework ... School would be the best thing ever ! 
Hmmm ... Spend my Saturday in sweatpants relaxing and watching movies , or go to winter formal ... 
Sick . Of course . 
I have never been this bored in my entire life . 
Should probably start that homework . Hopefully there's a random ice storm tonight . 
Mmm ... Waking up at 4 am because I procrastinated for 3 days on homework ... Fun stuff . 
Gosh dangit . 
Just in case I fall asleep doing homework , my alarm is being set to 4:00 . That game was definitely NOT worth watching . 
Wayyy too much homework . I don't know how I'm going to survive during soccer season :( 
Boo science . 
Watching Sagwa episodes on YouTube . This is the life . 
Best day of apush EVER !!! 
In the end , the greatest snowball isn't even a snowball at all . It's fear . 
Just realized soccer starts in 1 week . Wow . 
Homework time :( 
I wonder if teachers ever facebook their students ... 
Poor < PROPMALE > :( 
< PROPMALE > Quijote was AMAZING ! 
Soccer try outs ! :D
