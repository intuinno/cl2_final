My resolutions for 2010 : Less Oblivious , A better friend , Calmer , Less Reviled , A Better Communicator , More Socially Ept . 

WON THE PRESTIGIOUS \MOST LIKELY TO BE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS\ " AWARD AT 4-H CHORUS !!! " 
\it's like watching carpet grow . \"" 
may be incommunicado for a few days ... THE ACADEMY IS HERE AND NOW !!! 
THE ACAD IS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE !!! 
is FINALLY in class ! Civil War History ROCKED , and am in American Lit . Great teachers ! 
is in the middle of a two-hour break ... during the middle of school ! Too bad I have to walk a huge way away for one of my classes , with three classes ' worth of books . 
Despite having so many classes , they are not all today ... Civitas is the only one that isn't . Ah well . I'm outside on a hot and beautiful day ( despite the earlier rain ) and am content doing homework with friends . Oh , did I mention that I'm 150 feet from any building , and have perfect wireless internet on my MacBook ? 
was an epic Vader ... pictures up as soon as < PROPFIRST > gets a USB cable for his camera . 
is \In a Relationship with Grace Casimer\ " . * two thumbs up * " 
puts his foot in his mouth too often ... then again , once is too often . I'm sorry , everybody . 
FACEBOOK IS BLOCKED BY THE BALL STATE SERVER . THIS IS THROUGH AN OBVIOUS PROXY . WTF IS UP WITH BSU ? 
FACEBOOK IS BACK UP ! 
just had an excellent dinner with Grace and her mom ! Mrs. Casimer , you rock ! 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-republican-party-is-t_b_262594.html I am not in agreement with the title , but I do agree with the logic exposing the illogic of the modern Republican Party . 
thinks that deep , honest conversations are great . 
just helped clean up where a little kid at Burris had stomach issues . Sounds like lifeguarding . 
and Grace Casimer went on their first date ! It was so fun ! < PROPFEMALE > Express to go ; dinner in a park ; walked around talking ; it was chilly , but :) 
wrote a 13 < PROPFEMALE > paper . No sweat . Now , for editing ... 
has four A's , a B , and two classes with no response yet ... WOOT ! 
found out that he got a 103/100 on a Pre-Calculus for AP test ... Five A's now ! 
believes that , if everything in life happens for a reason , The Big Bang Theory ( tv show and science both ) happened . What is the reason ? I don't care ! I love them both ! 
believes that life is good , but it is hard to do the right thing , sometimes . 
is happy that study session was ( unofficially ) finished ten minutes early ! 
Stratford , Ontario , Canada , here I come ! I'm updating this from the bus ! 
I'm going to \The Importance of Being Earnest ! \"" 
Vanity is the weak man's imitation of strength . 
Wilde wiled me with his wielding of words . 
feels sick ... I'm going to tough it out until A ) I feel better , or B ) I finally throw up . 
feels mostly better :) 
has heard that , apparently , everybody on the Stratford trip has had some minor illness ... not just me . Misery loves company ! 
is heading to Earth Singers ! Hope it's good ! 
thinks he looks like Draco Malfoy in one of his pictures . 
KNOWS he looks like Draco Malfoy in one of his pictures . 
is finished with classes for the day ! Now , time for homework < PROPFEMALE > Decker Chemey . 
is watching epic third season Big Bang Theory episodes ! 
has 7 As , and a B+ at Midterms !!! 
wonders what is wrong with him . True happiness for a friend in the face of what ( I assume ) would make another person angry ? I thought that waited until we were senile ! XD 
Klansmen ... Bigotry in Bedsheets . I love this class . 
Exclusivity in religion ; I don't know why I'm bringing up potentially offensive things , but anyways ; where'd my chalk go ? 
my social life at this school is the exact opposite of at my home school . Why is there a similar result in one certain area ? 
I am either ESFP or ENFJ , depending on my mood , etc . 
is about to start meeting potential Juniors for next year ! Preview Day FTW ! 
' s Answer : Yes . 
started out looking up when the next Big Bang Theory episode is ( today ) and ended up reading psychoanalysis of every cast member , as well as synopses of every episode ... Yes , I'm a nerd . 
Remember to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day ... A wave of silence ' cross the land ... On Remembrance Day .................. 91 years ago today , the last shells were fired . 91 years ago today , the War to End All Wars ended , but War did not cease ... If you are a person who believes that today should always be remembered , put this as your status all day . 
is working on his first blog posts . I'll link you all when they're up . 
IS GOING TO THE SENATOR LUGAR SYMPOSIUM ! 
Just finished his first blog post , and another one's on the way . 
Goodnight , world . It's time for 7.5 hours of sleep . At least I finally got my Civ paper done . 
clicks \Join Group\ " and up pops a window . \ " You are a member of too many Groups . \ " I guess it's time to eliminate \ " a few . \ " Sorry I didn't listen to you guys earlier . " 
Story of my life at the Academy : I was doing homework , when I decided to take a half-hour nap ( I had been up late doing homework the night before ) . I wake from my nap to find that three hours had passed .

I DEFINITELY thought that I had four more < PROPFEMALE > s to write . It turns out that I had four < PROPFEMALE > s done and only one < PROPFEMALE > ( required ) to write . This is why I celebrate the little things . MLIA 
I WILL BE COMPLETLY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ... you can ask me three questions . Any question no matter how crazy it is I will answer it no matter what . You have my full honesty , I swear . I dare you to put this as your status and see what questions you get ! 
I WILL BE COMPLETLY HONEST if you ask me to . Any question is just fine , no matter how crazy it is . I will answer it honestly no matter what .

Who can help me solve the following equation without calculus ? [ 2*(5^2x)]-[7*(5^x)]+3 = 0 Gevirtz just had that question on a 126 point QUIZ and he never taught us how to solve them . 
is studying like he's never studied before ... Oh wait , that's true . 
I hopped on the band wagon . Moltres is pretty cool . 
I just failed my Precalculus for AP final , despite 7 hours of studying over the weekend . Thank you , Dr. Gevirtz , for asking us to do 114/136 of the points without a calculator , and expecting us to find the < PROPFIRST > to fractions , no decimals . Gah ! 
Ok , I definitely only meant for Moltres to be up for 24 hours . I guess 31 hours is fine . I like my Poketta Monstros XD 
Somebody above likes me . AN A- ON MY GEVIRTZ FINAL ? He must have added in 40 free points XD 
2 A's , 2 A-'s , and 2 B's .... AWESOME !

< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , we barely knew ye . 
Is there something I should know ? Is there something I did wrong ? If there is , send me a message . All the alarm bells have rung , I just need to know where to go , now . 
Saturnalia ! Gotta Love Big Bang Theory !

is in the Vegas Airport ... Great ... Everything natural around here is dead , and washed over with Neon . 
I'm afraid . I'm venturing into new territory , the unknown . I have friends who can help guide me , but the trip must be made in solitude . 
Finally got my loft up last night ... 2 Feet of clearance REALLY isn't all that much XD 
Classes went well today . Only one , but many lessons learned . Kinda . I learned them , but it's all about getting them into everyday knowledge and suitability where the rub is . 
I don't want your love , I wanna be friends !

If there is an unjust law that I feel strongly about , I will civilly disobey , in the manner of Thoreau and MLK Jr.

What if the entire world spoke a language , and everybody was expected to learn it ? What if you spoke a language understood where you came from , but that sounded as something else on Earth ? Serenity , Acceptance , Courage , Wisdom .

This is not a status to be liked . Do not like this status . It is neither happy nor funny . 
has been 17 for 6 months ... What a transformative half year this has been !

I am about to turn 18 , and I want to share it with you , my 722 closest friends . 
All I'm going to say is that I received more text alerts from Facebook in a two hour stretch than I usually do in a week because of everybody wishing me a happy birthday . There are too many of you to thank individually , so I thank you all ! 
did anybody have Smiercziak for AP Chem last year ? Is it worth it to try to get into Adams's ? I had Adams last year and loved his teaching style , and I want your opinions .

It's been a good day so far ! 
I think that life would be so much easier if you could see WHO you want to see , WHENEVER you want to see them . I know I'd be much happier . 
Well this is certainly odd . I put down my homework for a five minutes's nap , and I wake up nearly 6 hours later . Yay for super naps ?

YES 
is a straight ally and today is National Coming Out Day . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and only five states plus DC recognize that love , not gender , is what matters in a marriage .

People with vegetarian recipes : I've been talking with the Dining Service lady , and she has been asking me for recipes . I don't know any . RULES : They MUST be healthy ( not high in fat or sugars ) , they cannot require outlandish ingredients , and they must appeal to a wide palate , including non-vegetarians ( though this last one is least important ) . 
So , Fire Marshal ... The purpose of the Academy is to bring people together ; our open-door policy helps to reduce the number of artificial barriers between us . I wouldn't mind closing the doors in the case of a fire ( and would kick out the doorstops so they'd close in an emergency ); what is sensible in an emergency is often not sensible when there is not an emergency . \
