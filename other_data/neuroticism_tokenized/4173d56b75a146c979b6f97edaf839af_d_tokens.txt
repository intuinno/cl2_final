The girl you just called fat ? Has been starving herself & has lost 30lbs . The boy you just called stupid ? Has a learning disability and studies four hours every night . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting on makeup hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He gets abused enough at home . There is a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if your against bullying .
