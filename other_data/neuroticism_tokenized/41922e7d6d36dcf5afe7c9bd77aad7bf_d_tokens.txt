Safe at home :D Happy 2010 ! 

Whoever thought putting < PROPFIRST > Crusher in a red uniform made any sense was obviously not a Vulcan . I bet Wil Wheaton looks terrible in yellow . 
Can you tell it was my birthday today ?

\My dear Lestrade . Please give me some credit for having a brain . \"" 
Watching Lady GaGa on < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ; if you don't like her , this interview will change your mind ( if you're open to having it changed ) . It has touched on everything I like about her , and we're only 10 minutes in . 
\Look up at the sky . Ask yourself

Secret of the Kells : a gorgeous , adorable , and intelligent animated film . 
< PROPMALE > video is totally crazy awesome . <3 you , GaGa . 
Just watched The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus . Knew I recognized < PROPMALE > ; he's one of the few side characters I like who lives ! ( < PROPFIRST > - Doctor Who , Daleks in Manhattan ) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Hotes , apparently the guy who played < PROPMALE > Hamlet was on TNG at one point . Check < PROPFEMALE > 90 of your program , Howie Seago . 
I don't think I can describe how I'm feeling in a Facebook post , but the prospect of typing out a long LJ entry is equally unpalatable . \Meh \"?" 
I must go , I must leave this place , I have somewhere to go , I have a new road to follow 
Got an A in her history class . Who has a cumulative GPA of 2.45 ? That's right . This person . 
Don't ask me how or why , but I'm gonna make it happen this time . 
OMG < PROPMALE > YOU WERE RIGHT YOU WERE RIGHT !!! 
Just submitted my AmeriCorps application . Not sure how I feel about that . Oh , apathy- I can't bring myself to feel very strongly about you one way or the other . 
\No ! I've been dumped by my high school boyfriend ! The only natural \ 
If you've cut power to all but the most critical of life support systems , why are all the lights still on ? 
\One time 
Swam in a lake yesterday , and never even turned my computer on . WHAT ?? XD 
fails at life and her mom isn't answering the phone . 
So , I got the new Harvest < PROPFEMALE > game in the mail today , but the mailbox won't unlock because it's in the way . Probably for the better ; I just finished the essay I have due tomorrow ( and now have HOURS I could be playing that game !!! ) . Stupid mailperson . 
Exactly one month from now I will be screaming . Loudly . To LIVE GAGA . * monster claws * 
The VV Halloween preparations have officially begun . Excitement is running high ! 
_Havemercy_ by Jaida Jones and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . Read this book . METAL DRAGONS . 
is going to PAX but doesn't have a place to stay ! < /shameless begging > 
Managed 3/3 A-grade essays . Who wants to read my research paper on the castrati when it's finished ? It will probably snag another A . Because apparently I'm just that good . 
has ALMOST had enough of the castrati to last her a lifetime . ... Who's up for watching Farinelli later ? 
I want to see some opera this year ! < PROPMALE > Quixote sounds fun , but what I REALLY would like to see is The Magic Flute ! Playing May 2011 at the McCaw Hall ! 
DONE ! Only 6 < PROPFEMALE > s , but 6 FULL < PROPFEMALE > s , and 6 GOOD < PROPFEMALE > s , and the flipping Works Cited < PROPFEMALE > is a FULL < PROPFEMALE > , too , for chrissakes . Whoo ! TOTALLY watching Farinelli tomorrow night ( if < PROPFIRST>'s up for it ! ) !! 
It suddenly got dark in my living room . Time for light ! 
You know what's awesome ? Randomly getting the day off . I'm going to listen to some Magic Flute and take a nap , then I might draw or write something , or watch a movie , or play a video game , because I'M DONE WITH SCHOOL AND I'M NOT WORKING TODAY . WIN . < /brag > 
SH : I'm not a psychopath I'm a high-functioning sociopath , do your research . 
I can now saw with conviction that Lady Gaga is one of the most genuine and incredible people in show business today and I am PROUD to be one of her little monsters ! I LOVE YOU , GAGA !!! 
\Everyone speaks the language of love . \ " -Lady Gaga " 
Yeah , totally snagged another A last quarter . I am on FIRE ! 
So , remember how I said I'd like to see The Magic Flute in the spring ? Wouldn't mind seeing < PROPFIRST > Elliot : The Musical , either . I mean , that just looks awesome . Also , HAIR is playing at the Paramount again this season . Should make < PROPFEMALE > see it , since it's so different ( read : better ) than the movie . 
may or may not have strep throat . I really wish I didn't have to work tomorrow . 
So yup , totally have strep ! If you < PROPMALE > out with me this weekend , you'd better be getting your OJ on :P I actually feel better today , though , so that's good . Also , first ever male doctor ? Super-mega-foxy-awesome-hot . Totally thought the hot doctor thing was a myth . It is NOT . 
I am interested to hear what my friends think of surrogate motherhood as far as its controversial nature . I was frankly surprised to discover that so many States and foreign countries consider surrogacy an illegal practice . Why ? What are some of the arguments against it ? Please discuss ! 
FINALLY got my tattoo today ! It looks SO much cooler than I ever thought it could , I love it to pieces . In three hours I get to take the bandage off and I'll post pictures then :D 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > of the Desert : The Musical . Totally a thing . Must see . 
Whaaarglabrablgarble next book now plzthx . JAIDA JONES YOU ARE A GENIUS . I cannot possibly wait ten months for more . Guess I'll just have to read Havemercy again , now . 
Dude . < PROPFEMALE > is such . A bitch . What the hell does Finn see in her ? And I hope we get to hear more of Sunshine , since I actually prefer her voice :P Also , thank you , Mr. Shue for not being a poo-poo head for more than one episode . 
I'm sad that my top two favorite boy's names right now are < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . Not fair . 
So , if they're cat people , why the hell do the charr have horns ? 
Hypothesis : Asura tech = underwater breathing . 
I like it on the floor . 
is ACTUALLY cleaning her room . Crazy . 
Room cleaning : 60% completion . I'm only aiming for 75% , though . Bathroom cleaning : 90% . At 100% ? Breaking for Glee . 
Oh , Glee , why do you make me cry all the time ? Grilled Cheesus ? Best episode yet , imo . Also , I think < PROPMALE > had his best song yet in it , too . <3 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , guys ! <3 
I absolutely cannot wait until I'm not busy anymore . That will most likely be January , but I'll settle for November now , thanks . * dies of exhaustion * 
Library sucks for not having a book I want to read . I bought it , and read the first 53 pages online , but it's not coming until Monday and the Google Book isn't complete ( of course ) . IF I HAD A KINDLE I COULD BE READING IT RIGHT NOW . * cry * 
Goatee = Bad Guy . Never forget this . 
Brb , voting . 
is a redhead again . 
OK , guys ! I've posted nearly 200 pictures from VV Halloween . It's a tag-yourself free-for-all , because I'll shoot myself if I have to tag all those pictures ! You'll be lucky if I get them all turned the right way around :P 
Glee . Just . Just . Gah . I love Glee so much . This week's episode ? SO . AMAZING . Seriously . Ask my roommates ; I'm freaking out . I might have to , like ... watch it AGAIN . Oh , and < PROPMALE > CRISS . 
So Hot Topic totally has a shirt with Lady Gaga wearing the outfit I based my Halloween costume on on it . Do want . 
Does anybody remember that < PROPMALE > thing that was posted a while back where a bunch of < PROPMALE > ists got together and made this digital loop of never-ending < PROPMALE > that you scrolled through the middle of and it was awesome ? I'm trying to find that , but ( as evidenced by this post ) am having a hard time describing it for a search engine . 
Power out at work today = go home early ! Thankfully the power is still on here . The wind blowing the snow around looks really cool , I'll admit . 
Finally got Chrome , and in so doing pruned down all my tabs . My computer is thanking me ! 
Had an urge to write a poem passing my old house on Knox a bit ago . But it , like my car , and the nostalgia , has passed . 
Mission Clean Out Trunk Of Car : Complete . Mission Clean Out Cab Of Car : In Process . Mission Write Two Five-Page Papers In Two Days : Accepted . 
Totally danced and sang on stage with a bunch of real-life Broadway actors . Pretty sure that's what I want to do for the rest of my life . I LOVE YOU , HAIR . 
Who knows what stands in front of our lives ? I fashion my future on films in space . 
Homemade fudge ? Really ? I love Bear Creek UMC ! <3 
Is it just me , or is < PROPMALE > ( ie . < PROPMALE > Criss , ie . < PROPMALE > FUCKING Potter ) the new favorite on Glee ? BECAUSE HE IS AMAZING . Sing more , dude . Sing more . 
So I just found a picture on the internet urging Christians to \take back the rainbow\ " . Why do we have to be so possessive of symbolism ? Why can't we share the rainbow ? " 
Wait , they're making Dark Tower movies ? WHAT ??? * runs off to google * 
This assignment is not as difficult as I anticipated . I'm halfway finished and it's only taken me two ( lazy , slow ) hours to produce high-quality , complete answers . If I actually powered through it , I'm sure I could do an equally high-quality job on the last half in half the time . But I think I'll be lazy and stretch it out a bit longer . Since I can . 
School update : Not as bad as I feared . I just need to have MHS send yet another thing to WCC , and all should be well . Do need to stop by the advisors after class tomorrow to get them to sign my degree application , though . Progress ! 
Apparently I need to start adding more a cappella and pop music to my collection . Any recommendations ? 
FINALLY started reading Homestuck . Is pretty hilarious . 
WHOO ! SNAGGED A C IN MY SCIENCE CLASS , BITCHES ! * victory dance * I ... will not share exactly what a relief that is XD 
\Soccer moms be thumpin ' that sh*t for ripeness like melons . Know what I'm sayin' ? \"" 
Tell all you want , ladies and gents , and I can't guarantee they're not gonna ask . 
WE DID IT ! Thank you , friends , for pledging to support the Rivertown project ! <3 
Iplehouse is teasing me , again . Here's hoping them opening the custom choice again is indicative of a pattern ( ie . they'll open it again when I actually have money ) . Stupid dolls being stupid pretty . 
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends ... 
My dearest 1031 : I miss you , too . <3 
BY THE WAY , I've been telling everyone how awesome < PROPFIRST > Vasilinda is , because they've all been asking . He knows what I mean ( I hope ) . Hurry and save me from the crazies ! 
So someone asked me a really persistent and pointless question about green tags today , and I realized that she'd basically asked me what the heck the tag meant . If you have worked at the VV , you should find that as amusing as I did . 
I had a dream last night that I went to PAX in my Codex costume and we ran into the guy who plays Zaboo and took pictures , and < PROPMALE > Cumberbatch was the guest of honor at the opening ceremony . It was weird . 
Brooooke for the next three days . Also , cross your fingers that < PROPFIRST > isn't dead for good this time . 
Hat+Beard combo : check . 
The Power Ballad . That is : A love song that is < PROPFIRST > in all caps . For instance : I'M GONNA KEEP ON LOVIN ' YOUUU ' CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING I WANNA DOOO . 
Damn . Now I'm crying over a car . What next . 
< PROPMALE > Criss . Why do you keep doing things that make me love you SO MUCH MORE THAN I ALREADY DO . Why . Just . Stop it . 
Just occurred to me that , of all the Glee boys , I would love to date < PROPFIRST > . He's such a nerd . 
Disappointed that that entire episode contained no ( zero , practically negative quantity ) < PROPMALE > or < PROPMALE > Criss -- I mean < PROPMALE > . But I swear to God , practically every episode of this silly show brings me to tears at some point . 
I'm so glad we have a < PROPFEMALE > . It is definitely one of my favorite things . I <3 you , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Colored part of my hair with a marker today to match my red fall for my sale day costume . I need a better one if that's gonna be the plan for Codex . Need the real McCoy -- Crayola washables all the way , baby . It's like fifth grade all over again . 
\I woulde I knewe how of thee I might be quitten ! \"" 
By the way , Sir Percival in BBC's < PROPMALE > is the most adorable of all knights . <3 
NEWSFLASH : I WILL be coming to Bellingham today ! If this matters to you , I'll be messaging you shortly :P 
SO , who's going to Comicon ( ECCC ) this weekend and wants to carpool ( ie . be my taxi) ? I'd not planned on < PROPFIRST>'s death , and am at a loss as far as transportation is concerned . 
Opinion : Is $70 too much to spend for a photo with < PROPMALE > Spiner and < PROPMALE > Frakes ( Lt . Cmdr . Data and Cmdr . Will Riker of the USS Enterprise D) ? 
Just made a dress in less than four hours . And before you ask , it's a real-people-sized dress . 
So my new internet connection is pathetically slow . I've never known 54mbps to be so slow . Also my desktop blue-screened for no apparent reason . Hooray , computer problems ! Can I move back home , now ? 
I have now mapped out good bus routes to and from the convention center ( which I may use for work , too ) , as well as discovered I can fit a pair of jeans in my Lady in Gray purse , which makes me very happy . 
So the internet is working much better now that I ... rebooted the modem . * facepalm * 
So , if I shred a potato with a cheese grater and fry it in < PROPFEMALE > oil , will it become a delicious hash-brown type thing , or are there more steps to that ? 
I just discovered that < PROPMALE > Spiner played Cervantes/Don Quixote in Man of la Mancha in LA a few years ago . How much more awesome can this guy get ? 
Forgot my phone at home on the worst possible day to forget my phone at home : The day I try the bus to work for the first time . Apparently the 72 Express doesn't stop at NE Campus Parkway and 12th Ave . like it says on both the website and the printed timetable . Either that or 9 actually means 12 . Whatever . I made it to work , but my feet are covered in blisters . 
Also , just realized that what I thought was a really random Libra shirt at comicon last week , was actually a chick rockin ' a Homestuck tee . Go you , random person . And no , < PROPMALE > , I'm not there , yet ; I just scrolled down the < PROPFEMALE > .

Two things I've decided I really need as far as my doll hobby goes : A Dremel , and a respirator mask . Mi'kael's head moves to two different positions ( straight ahead , and < PROPFEMALE > down ) , and that is a problem that can only be solved with heavy modding . The mask is so I don't die from breathing toxic resin fumes whist sanding the shit out of his neck . * enthusiastic two thumbs-up * 
Well I've been afraid of changing cause I've built my life around ... me . 
So , the Screwtape Letters are really really good . I'm having a lot of fun underlining things ( with a real pencil , in a real book ) . 
So just by the way , I'm really into hating the Seattle Metro right now . They've done nothing but thwart me at every turn since I moved here ! The least they could do would be to keep their timetables and stop schedules current . 
Sometimes I wish I could sell my vote for the amount I pay in taxes . 
DAVE : safer than some flintstone vitamins in a bottle \ 
DAVE : keep twisting < PROPMALE > all you get is clicks 
And while the future's there for anyone to change , still you know it's seems\ 
It would be easier sometimes to change the past 
Omg , Glee . Glee , glee , glee glee gleeeeeeeee . 
For the life of me I cannot remember\ 
What made us think that we were wise and\ 
We'd never compromise 
I am having such a great day ! I blame the beautiful sun . I love you , Sun . Time to get some laundry done while I'm still feeling productive ! <3 
Omigosh , so I guess this is outing my purchase to my parents ( but I actually made the purchase back around Christmas when I had money and the company just takes forever to ship ) but my Namu head shipped today ! <3<3<3 SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW . 
Bedtime :) Being productive feels so good . Must get more quarters for next load of laundry tomorrow ! 
HUGE double rainbow right over my house on the way home . And it didn't start raining until just now :) YET ANOTHER PERFECT DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD , GUYS . ( Yep , awesome enough for caps . ) 
Hope has made it out of customs in San Fransisco . It doesn't take that long for a package to get from SF to here , does it ? ... Should probably make him some clothes this weekend . 
Painting my elf ears , at the moment . Thinking I'm going to work on < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s wig this weekend , as well as making clothes for the new boy , and possibly figuring out the method of dyeing for my bangs/hair . So many crafty bits . 
We ... We are ... We are the ... We are the Altar ... We are the Altar Boyz .... 
Pretty sure this is the first year I haven't been pranked ONCE on April Fools . Not even a small one .
