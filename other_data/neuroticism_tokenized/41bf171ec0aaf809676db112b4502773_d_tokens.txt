who needs happiness when you have facebook :P 
a waitress ... Maybe , we'll see :P Just watch , probably won't work :P 
old emails and IM conversations ... Why do I do this to myself ?

its going to be a long night ... 
Pity things don't happen for a reason .

a long day of working , cleaning out my old room , and driving a lot ... Hello pillow ...

Thats how it goes sometimes , things just don't work out . But hey , who really cares ! It never stays that way for long :P 
I just saw the new ford taurus , my god its ugly :P 
I have 2 guitars , 1 acoustic and 1 electric . MUST GO !! I will give them away to get rid of them ! But I'd like to get a little something out of it :P Let me know 
pure , raw talent . No extras , no gimmicks . Always incredible ! 
has had a whirlwind of a day . Woken up with the news that < PROPMALE > had died the night before ( my condolences to his family ... ) , flat tyre , lots of driving and moving of heavy furniture ( with help from Deven , thanks mate ! ) . Now its time to sleep in my new apartment , and get ready for another day , which will probably be just as hectic . 
caffeine is a little irritating now :P 
just made my first complaint since moving in . Loud music coming from the unit behind mine , woke me up at 7 with 5 hours of sleep . People are just annoying sometimes ... 
4 calls from politicos today . 4 !! Is there a way to tell them to sod off ? 
Some days work can really get in the way ... 
has had one hell of a weekend . Fully trained the staff of the new BTO in VA . Got a new roommate for me and < PROPFEMALE > ( its a green anole ) . And had a little incident with the police . Hopefully next weekend will be calmer :P 
yikes ! 
Good god , really ? 
well , I won a little gift set from Facebook Sweepstakes . But before I can collect , I need to sign a release form so they can use my name face and comments for free . Yea I don't think so :P 
is tired , but should have fun today at < PROPFIRST > & Lindas . Sadly theres also work later . 
Dublin Coddle and TPLPA for lunch . Work from 3-10 tonight as well . Too bad I can't go to the TMY , I need my curry :( 
Just needs a vacation , that should at least make it more bareable 
is sorely tempted to find another job ... 
Class may be boring , but I just found out I get to go to fall ball for free :P 
regular customers are the best , they actually WANT to talk to you :P 
has decided to go see < PROPFIRST > Pilgram vs . The World tonight . Anyone want to join me ? 
2 out of 300+ , good record ? Nope , but who's to complain :P 
Should be fun tonight . First date I've been on in a long time . Too bad its wayy out at oracle and wetmore :P 
well that was a bust :( 
Back to the store soon . Once there need to leave again to pick up the truck from the fairgrounds ( I told him we needed it but noooo ) then back to the store till 11 . Fall Ball from 8 to whenever we decide to leave tomorrow . Can't wait for this month to be over :P 
Has had one hell of a weekend . And its wayyyy to long to post in a status :P So if you want to know all of it message me . The highlights though are : playing bodyguard to my coworkers wearing the suit , listening to rock non-stop , getting punched in the jaw in a mosh pit and spending a great time with < PROPFEMALE > Surran and Ban Matilla . 
wow my throat really hurts today 
well , first day one the new diet . Which consists of juice , water and 1 bowl of ramen every day . So far I've done pretty well , though I've had 2 cookies , so not all that great I guess :P 
hmm , script 
some days you just have to ask yourself ' why ? ' 
The Party was a lot of fun . Great food , great entertainment , and of course THE BARENAKED LADIES !! < PROPFIRST > managed to sneak me in to the front row and I got < PROPMALE > Creeggans autograph ! 
I have an extra pass to go see Due Date on wednesday at 7 . Anyone want to come with me ? First come first served . 
interesting night at work , but still fun ! 
Just made my first batch of fried rice on my own . Might < PROPFEMALE > be able to give < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s fried rice a run for her money :P 
The Last Enemy : Good mini-series , points out what would happen in a modern Orwellian nation . A little scary in some ways . 
Turns out I can't go to the screening tomorrow , anyone want 2 passes to see Due Date ? 7pm tomorrow at el con . I'll email them to you ! 
*@^%%^&$^&** (#^^&* $^^&# 
Application : Approved !, Testing date : Waiting to hear back , should be a week or so . Hopefully this works out ! 
gonna get the title to my car transferred and the new registration done . Sucks that I have to do emissions as well , but oh well . Going shooting tomorrow with < PROPFIRST > Szach , so I'll take my frustration out on some targets :P 
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait , what ? 
I really need to do my papers ... 
You know , if you leave your big expensive < PROPMALE > car unlocked with the door open , yea I'm probably going to take a look inside to see if there's anything worth while in there . So don't come screaming at me when I do , its your own fault . 
apparently TSA still has an opening :P Sounds good to me ! 
Got a testing date for TSA ! November 30th

Psych paper progress : Abstract , done ; < PROPFEMALE > 1 , done ; < PROPFEMALE > 2 , nearly done . Getting there ! 
Oh and the < PROPMALE > wedding is going to be on my birthday !!! 
Practicing ' The Scientist ' and ' Teenage Dreams ' on the guitar rather than doing school ... I'm terrible :P

Just finished writeing a 20 < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > on how to run a BTO . VERY tempted to copywrite it in my name just to piss them off 
Today : Worked from 9-5 , training new store owners from < PROPMALE > . Tomorrow : work from 9-4 , still training . Then later that night , Winter Wonderjam with Syd !! 
makeing brown rice for the first time , a little different from the rice I'm used to makeing , but still good . 
had a pretty crappy day . But I made up for it by spending time with a very cute baby ( I had no idea they could tire you out so quickly , my arms feel like lead :P ) and writing a reccomendation letter for a friend . 2 things which can always make you think ' its not so bad ' . 
Needs a vacation badly ... 
ahhh , < PROPFIRST > Bochelli playing in the background , catching up on my FB sweepstakes entries , and fixing computers . Just what I need to relax . And tomorrow , surgery WOO HOO !! 
Ok fine , I'll bend to peer pressure :P Message me a number between 1 and 300 and I'll post something scathing about you . jk jk , it'll be nice .... I think ... 
there are days I wish there was like 2 or 3 of me ... 
Christmas shopping ... Can everyone just make it easy on me and go buy their own gifts ? 
Ugggg 
Not looking forward to tomorrow ... 
Got a B in my Psych class , woo ! 
Student loans , lovely ... 
Early to work , late to leave , makes a man hungry , cranky and mean 
that just made my night :) 
I don't want a lot for Christmas , There's just one thing I need , I don't care about the presents , Underneath the Christmas tree , I just want you for my own , More than you could ever know , Make my wish come true , All I want for Christmas is ... \ 
You 
Gonna go shopping for a vacuum soon . 
3 and a half hours to go ... Wonderful ... 
Oprah Winfrey is getting her own channel ?? Wtf ?? 
Should have gone to Mexico .... 
the theme tune to ' Men Behaving Badly ' is really starting to get on my nerves 
What else can you do ? Not a whole lot . 
Can't I just not work anymore ? Sure being sick gets you out of work . But I don't like being sick . I need middle ground ... 
Hell is around the corner by Tricky is my new favourite song ! 
Got orientation starting on the 24th ( hopefully ) for UofP , got a test for CBP tomorrow plus a massage at 3 ( need that ) , and then a test for PCSD on the 22nd . Do the tests ever end ? 
Should I ? 
I have to Legion hats if anyone is interested . Not quite my style , and free ! 
Ook so I've been using the new Firefox beta for a few days now and I've noticed something odd ... THEY RIPPED THE ENTIRE DESIGN FROM CHROME !!! How cheap is that ! 
App tabs are cool 
3 bluescreen errors in a day .... Might be time for some new hardware 
so apparently , I can start all my assignments for UNIV100 now , and just send everything in when its due . This is going to be easy !
