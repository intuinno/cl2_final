Busy , Busy . . . When I'm not working 9-5 at home I'm working on the Cutty with < PROPFIRST > or helping him out as much as I can with his truck ... Probably going to the bar tonight ! 
When you have grasped the concept of conditioned responses you have the knowledge/power to choose how you respond to life's experiences . You create your own happiness , melancholy , & moods . Developing your ability to choose which moods you dwell in influences the world you create around you . I wish you well in your ability to dwell in a world of happiness , allowing negativity to escape your conditioned responses

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world ; the unreasonable one\ 
persists in trying to adapt the world to himself . Therefore all\

Wow ! My neighbor charges through my house when we're not there , leaving a muddy trail all the way to our rooms . Smacks my dog , attacks my dad , and calls the cops on my friend for testing his trucks engine . What an adolescent adult ! 
Leaving\ 
to go up north with < PROPFIRST > in a few hours . . . Swiming , dirt bikes , four\ 
wheelers , absinthe , acoustic guitars , bonfires , bacon-burgers on the grill , and good times . . .

Hanging\ 
with the treo of girls last night at the Hotel & Rhino then\ 
sleeping in my own bed was surely more appealing than a bonfire in the\ 
rain with someone I abhor . Another good choice led to another great\ 
night . :) 
We take pictures of the good times to remember them ... we need no reminders of the bad ones , they leave scars on our hearts we < PROPFEMALE > with us the rest of our lives . 
I think I'm interested in getting a category \A\ " lincense in skydiving ... Costs though ... Not sure how long I can spread out the jumps in the training to afford it . Once you get your license jumping is pretty cheap ! " 
So few can handle complete honesty or know many people that can ... I suppose that's why people need white lies to save face ... I prefer complete honesty ... we all have our vices .

Never fear to stand boldly against the grains of society . If history has proven anything , it's that things change & usually in the way of progress . Each stage in the evolution of humanity can be accredited to overcoming a degree of ignorance . 99% of society can believe the Earth is flat & be wrong . Those that live in the dark cave of ignorance remain there out of the egos fear of facing reality .

Sometimes my bucket list feels more like a fuckit list ... Sometimes . 
Currently I'm in a long distance relationship ... I'm in South Lyon ... and she's in the future . 
Had a great night at the Hotel & Rhino ... It actually felt good to be the DD , and not the LDD ( least drunk driver ) ... The blackberry something or ' nother band , I dont remember , played at the Rhino and they sounded great , very talented group , I must say ! :) 
lol \Kids say the darndest things ! ... Yeah ? You would too ... If you didn't know anything ! \""

An opinion is a subjective statement or thought about an issue or\ 
topic & is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts ; it may be supported by an argument , although people may draw\ 
opposing opinions from the same set of facts . If you're going to share an opinion , it's best to share it constructively & without the arrogance of presuming you're the only one with the correct perspective .

woke up at 8am feelin ' great ... & decided to go disc-golfing alone ... didn't do too bad ... played 15 holes & ended with a +3 ( 2 Mulligans ) ( No cheating if Mulligans don't count ) Time to do a little biking before it rains ... or perhaps work on some music so I can accomplish something with J.R. ... Have a great weekend everyone ! :)

What a perfect combination of misfortune ... Extreme hopes are born from extreme misery ... So I must be thankful , I suppose , for such an opportunity for extreme hope . I've only been waiting for around 25 years ...

Oh joy , I'm working again , actual labor ... Started my new job yesterday ... Lame hours , 3:30 pm - 1:00 am Mon-Fri ( some saturdays ) ... My shift might change to days though If I get lucky ... Or I might be called to interview somewhere else & work there instead .... Dunnage is the place , fabricating metal & vinyl pieces is the job . 
http://www.failblog.org 
Job hours changed to 2:30 -11pm ... My job's fine , It's ok , boring and a little hard on the back and feet ... the only part I really don't like is how much my hands keep getting cut up and blistered , it messes up my playing guitar ... In the end it might help though , by increasing their callosity ... 
Why are so many people such SHITTY DRIVERS !? The acceleration < PROPFIRST > is for getting up to 70mph BEFORE you are ON the highway , not for poking along at 50mph all the way until you're MERGING with traffic already going 70mph+ ... And what's with jackasses that drive 10 under in a 45 , then 10 over in a 25 , clearly it's not because they care about the speed limit or laws , it's because their STUPID F'N DRIVERS !!! 
LOL , Just realized . . . 25 . . . JOY ! . . . /5 = 5 . . . X 5 = 125 . . . ah , whatever . . . Just another number . . . Since the moment it all begun , just another cycle around the sun . . . 
Thanks everyone ! :-) 
... is getting sick of the 9 hour days and 8 hour saturdays ... But I can't complain about the checks ! :) My feet , back , and hands are getting use to the work , my hands are SOOOO cut up , calosed , and dry ( but they're getting numb to it ) ... Real switch up from sitting in my room all day typing LMAO ... shot , < PROPMALE > , shot < PROPMALE > , shot , < PROPMALE > , goodnight ! 
Why Can’t You Tickle yourself ? . . . 
Sweet ! I'm losing weight and toning up again like back in the day when I had abs , I can see em again LOL ! I'm 10 lbs lighter and it's only been around a month ! 
Something great happened around this time last year ... Something I was lucky to of experienced ... Ohhh the memories ! 
I'm nice at work out of necessity , I call it nicessity ... 
My dad and I are working on updating the basement a little ... My idea of course ! :) I started by taking out this huge brick chair , we just finished painting the walls a nice brown that works with the paneling , next it's the carpet , then a 55\ tv ! " 
Hell yeah , snow day ! My factory has no power ... I love when areas go on ' pause ' the first < PROPMALE > snow of the year - to adjust . 
I believe in the power of symbols [ In human psychology/history ] ... which is why I will likely have many Christian ' related ' tattoos [ only because they are also related to SOOO MANY other religions][eventually ]; However , I am agnostic and feel most relatable to the principles of Buddhism ... A set of principles quite difficult to maintain without some level of actual contemplation ... 
\The greatest ignorance is to reject something you know nothing about . \ " I believe that too often the young turn away from knowledge for mostly 2 reasons : Ignorance of it's usefullness & applicability to their own life ; As well a lack of interest instilled by their families & society to escape from ignorance and embrace wisdom . I believe the same could be said about those that are no longer children . " 
Too damn cloudy to see the eclipse ! :( Aww well ... I remember trying to take pictures last time the < PROPFEMALE > was changing color , they sucked lol ... It was still pretty cool to watch though ... 
What's YOUR PORN < PROPFEMALE > NAME if using the formula \your first pets name ( or first dogs name)\ " + \ " The street you grew up on\ " ... My Porn < PROPFEMALE > name is Ritz < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > :) " 
\Why be unhappy about something\ 
“Everyone is on the bandwagon making fun of Scientologists . Christians , they want to criticize Scientologists . Hey man , I just cannot believe that you want to put your faith in science fiction , that is just about the craziest thing I’ve ever heard in my whole life . Now if you will excuse me I will continue reading my bible . And then the talking snake said , here eat the magical apple , because we’re all made of clay . ” 
I treat my facebook as a personal website used for many things , such as a photo library I can access quickly on my iPhone , or record of things I find funny , or a lot of the time a place to keep notes on things I'm studying ... Right now , and for awhile now , I've been studying religions ... Before that it was detecting lies , and reading non-verbal communication ... 
I'm SUCH a night person ... All my greatest aspirations occur within the last hour before I go to sleep or in the shower ; and what are you really going to accomplish naked or in an hour !? o_O
