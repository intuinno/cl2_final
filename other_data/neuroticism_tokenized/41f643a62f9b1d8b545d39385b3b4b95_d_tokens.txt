Well survived an extremely whilrwind week even with adding in some very sad & unexpected turn of events . I thank god their are people out there that take the time to listen and help when a sad , hurtful situation happens . It should never hurt to be a child . 
attempting to prepare for a test that has no books or studying involved is stressful enough besides knowing the name of the test is a \stress test\ " !!!!!!!!!! i give these to people all day long monday thru thursday so it should be no big deal that I have to do one myself ! Ha ! i completely understand my patients anxiety now !! this sucks ! " 
playing thru the pain but pain can also be a good motivator ! batting . 1000 so far this season . 10-10 in 2 games . 22-4 tonight against my old team . it was a fun game , nice to be on the winning side of that score ! :) 
Had a freakin awesome day ! Spent the day at the Nuclear Pharmacy in Phoenix ! I so wanna go back !!! 
Ok I know today is monday but it so felt like a tuesday since I worked 11 hurs yesterday ! Thank god for Saturday off ! Played in a softball ttournament . Taking the Championship game was worth feeling the pain !! 
. 1000 batting average continues !!! woo hooo !!!! 
2 more work/school days then time to kick off the summer with a 4 day weekend with the kiddos bbqing , fun in the sun with friends and family but cant forget the relaxation ! 
Relaxtion is a good thing ! Going to take the kids to the park to enjoy the sunshine and watch the fastpitch softball tournament in town ! Go Lady Hawks !! 
Obama picks Memorial Weekend to go home to\ 
Chicago instead of following traditions and speaking at Arlington\ 
Cemetery . The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces\ 
but HE needs a break on the ONE day we are supposed to remember troops\ 
and all they've done . Repost this status if you think our troops are\ 
......... worth ...... remembering !! I hope a real AMERICAN gets a hold of\ 
him 
National Moment of Remembrance takes place @ 3 p.m. local time on Memorial Day & lasts 1 minute . The Moment doesnt replace traditional Memorial Day events , it is an act of National unity in which all Americans , alone or w/ family & friends , honor those who died for our freedom . It will help to reclaim Memorial Day as the sacred & < PROPMALE > holiday it was meant to be . In this shared remembrance , we connect as Americans 
Talking the kids to see the final chapter of Shrek and then to eat at Fuddruckers ! Its been a great weekend w/ family & friends ! If you can read this thank a teacher . If you can read this in English thank a soldier ! Thank you to all the past , present & future soldiers ! 
shrek forever after was good . very interesting seeing it in 3D in the second row !! Fuddruckers was as good as always !!! 
Should be sleeping . have to be up in 4 hours for work but today has been hell on wheels straight from the get go !! Moesdays suck !! on a good note my batting average continues to be . 1000 !!

I do not like this Uncle Sam , I do not like his health care scam . I do not like these dirty crooks , or how they lie and cook the books . I do not like when Congress steals , I do not like their secret deals . I do not like this spending spree , I’m smart , I know that nothing’s free . I do not like your smug replies , when I complain about your lies . I do not like this kind of hope . I do not like it , nope , nope , nope !
