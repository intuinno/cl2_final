is going to Graceland 
Some people are just a**holes . Forget those people's misdeeds , < PROPFEMALE > those who do you good , and just keep moving onward . 
Exquisite dead guy , outside my highrise apartment , exquisite dead guy , hanging from a skyhook . Ba da ba ba ba ba da ba , ba da ba ba ba ba da ba . How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel about you ? How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel about you ?

It feels weird to have finished my homework while it's still light outside ... but I have nothing to do ! I'm so booooorrrreeedddd 
I'm so bored !!!!! Someone talk to me !! 
Just finished Howl's Moving Castle . Hmph ! That was the only thing defending me from the evils of boredom . I guess I'll have to rely on the kind < PROPFEMALE > of my friends now . Oh God , this won't end well . :p JK , ily guys . <3 
Spirited Away = love

Why can't things go back to the way things were , back when I knew all of the answers . <3 
is writing a letter . fun fun :p 
is doin ' her homeboy work ... wow , that shows you how much I miss 8th grade ... :p 
How many times can a man turn his head and and pretend that he just doesn't see ? How many ears must one man have , before he can hear people cry ? How many deaths will it take till he knows , that too many people have died ? The answer , my friend , is blowin in the wind , the answer is blowin in the wind . 
I have a headache , so I tried listening to the sound of silence ( actual silence , not the song ) , but it didn't help . Now I'm just continuing to listen to Flood , chat with mah friends , and procrastinating like there's no tomorrow . :p 
Is procrastinating ... talk to me . :) 
Sing me a song that was a hit before your mother was born . Though she was born a long , long time ago , your mother should know . 
I really should be working ... nah ... 
This is for all the lonely people . Thinking that life has passed them by . Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup . And ride that highway in the sky . 
Still crazy after all these years ! :P <3

I feel like a traitor . Just got back from the Atholton game . :) ( go Gators ... :p ) 
STARS training , then I'm camping . Fun day , I hope . ;D 
How many years can some people exist , before they're allowed to be free ? 
Well that was extremely fun ! :D ILY you guys !!!! <3 
Changed her language to Pirate , and was impressed when she understood it easily . I however , was not impressed when it called me mum a wench . And I see no point in referring to girls as \Lady Cap'n\ " s . I'm a firm believer in gender equality . Girls can be cap'ns just as well as guys can . There's no need to set them apart . :P <3 Imma nerd . " 
Got some new Chucks . Bio project is hard . Yeah . TMLRN 
Wow . < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > really is amazingly brilliant . I'm afraid I'd forgotten . <3 :D 
Homework for most of the day , :( . But I'm gonna try to get together with < PROPFEMALE > , cause she's here this weekend . Gah , Bio is irritating me . :( ( I almost said Imma in that , but then I remembered that I'm an upper-middle class white girl who lives in the rural suburbs . ;P ) 
Happy birthday to the amazing < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , a father of Rock and Roll and master of the guitar !!!!!! I <3 him !!!!!!!!!!!! :D 
One < PROPMALE > , one shot , that's all anybody ever got . And I never knew before , but I feel like a child in a cold , cold war . So strong , so tough , sitting in suburbia , waiting for the wind up . And I dont want to dance , I just want to jump from the prison of circumstance . 
I just realized ... I should have done an amusement park for the Bio project . It would have been Palisades Park , and the cell type would have been a palisade cell . ;D ( I now officially love anyone who understood that . Unless you're actually from New Jersey . ) 
Lie still little bottle . 
All I wanted was some ckickens . Was that too much to ask ?!!! 
And I think , maybe , but I don't know , but I'm starting to feel like I got a brain problem situation on my hands . 
I'm in a feud . Me and chickens are no longer on good terms . :( :P 
Why am I up at two in the morning ? Oh yeah , I drowned in school ... I remember the days when I could actually sleep ... ahhh , those were nice . 
If I'm grumpy today , don't take it personally . It's just because I'm only now going to sleep . It's 2:36 in the freakin ' morning . Bleh . :P 
Why are my blueberries sparkly ? 
Homeboywork . Bleh . And I have a headache . This is going to be a fun night . :| 
How did I manage to lose my freakin ' binder !!! It's freakin ' huge !!!!!! Oh God ... 
I have a < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > album on vinyl . This makes me feel happy inside . :D <3333333333333333333 < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is my one true love . :D 
We ain't too pretty , we ain't too proud . We might be laughing a bit too loud . Ah , but that never hurt no one . Only the good die young .

I'm listening to my < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > album on the record player ... Does that make me a strange child ? 
Eatin ' my salad , lis'nin ' to my records . It's a good day . :D 
... Nik Kershaw ?????? What ? 
My < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > album is < PROPFIRST > and staticy . This upsets me greatly . Stupid used record shop , not cleaning their vinyl before they resell it . :P 
hopes that a picture of herself being pushed in a shopping cart by her friends will be okay for the spanish project . 
Listening to records , farmville , sleeping . Busy afternoon . :P 
I'm quite sorry < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > , but I do believe I've missed the love train . This upsets me deeply . :( 
Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts , mutilated monkey's meat , chopped up birdies feet , french-fried eyeballs swimming in a pool of blood , and I forgot my spoon ! But I got my straw ! * slurp * ahhh ! I <3 Girl Scouts . Can you tell that I miss Camp ? 
Hey , guess what ! I love music . Yeah . <3 
Is upset , because SOMEONE's Stayin ' Alive 45 keeps skipping . Thanks MOTHER !

I let the drums do the talking . :) 
Dear people of farmville , Send me hay bales please ?? Love , < PROPFEMALE > 
My mother bought the song \Kung Fu Fighting\ " when it first came out . She was 8 years old . That girl has some taste :P ! On vinyl . My life is now complete . :D " 
Xandi < PROPMALE > is pretty cool . :D <3 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Kass is made of awesome ! <3 
Locked out of my house . Watching Degrassi at < PROPFEMALE>'s house . I'm so stupid . :( :P 
Turns out I was just bad at opening the garage , I actually wasn't locked out . Way to go , < PROPFEMALE > . Well , that one hour wasted . :P 
Your mother was an hamster , and your father smelled of elderberries ! 
is walking to Bloom to get some chocolate icing . Who's with me ?! 
Eatin my chocolate cake that I made . Woohoo ! :P 
Wait , tomorrow is ... wacky tacky day . Okay ... time to pull out random stuff from my closet . 
Sorry people that I am chatting with/are trying to chat with me , but chat is being annoying . Trying messaging me instead . :D Thank ya lovies ! 
I'm pretty sure that's illegal in most states ... :P 
I'm singing ! \III'mmm movin ' out ! \ " \ " Eeeeeeverybody haaaaas a dreeeeeam ! \ " \ " Seeing me and < PROPFIRST > down by the schoolyard ! \"" 
Stick your head in the microwave and get yourself a tan ! Talk with your mouth full , bite the hand that feeds you , bite off more than you can chew ! What can you do ? Dare to be stupid !!!!! I love Weird < PROPMALE > ! <3 
Home from the homecoming game , carving my pumpkin ! It's going to be ... SULU !!!! I miss all of my friends who aren't going to Resi . :( <3 
Wow , this Halloween was suckish compared to other years ... but probably better than homecoming ! Free < PROPFEMALE > !!! Went around with Xandi < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Blough , and < PROPFIRST > Hahn . We were cool . :D I was a Vulcan Science/Medical Officer in < PROPFEMALE > fleet . ( Or , as people kept referring to me , Spock/the one with pointy ears , from < PROPFEMALE > Trek ) 
\Fo shizzle mah nizzle\ " = \ " I concur with you wholeheartedly my African American brother\ " I <3 MLIA " 
I think I'm in love ... with < PROPMALE > Garfunkel's New York-accented , tenor voice . It's made of magic ! <3 
My surname is not Telrunya . 
I can't stop listening to \We Didn't Start The Fire\ " by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > !!!! It's soooo good ! <3 " 
Why do I feel like I'm gonna get two minutes of sleep tonight ?... 
Well I officially got 20 minutes of sleep ! Yay !! And I'm not even exagerrating , I literally went to bed at 5:45 am . Because I'm stupid , and a horrible example of humanity . 
When I look back on all that crap I learned in High School , it's a wonder I can think at all . But my lack of education hasn't hurt me none . ( except perhaps your grasp of double negatives ) I can read the writing on the wall . 
Yo , are you going to Scarborough Fair ? 
Yo , are you going to Scarborough Fair ? Cause if you are , then maybe we could go together . Don't worry though , I'll let you dance with the pretty girls , dancing in their < PROPFEMALE > dresses , with their elegant masks . I'll just stand , smelling of parsley , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and thyme . And this is the part where I tell you I've loved you forever , but we can skip that part if you'd like . ( If you get this quote , then I love you ! ) 
Ummm ... why are there Scottish people singing in my head ??? Wait , I hear ... bagpipes ??? 
I'm sorry , but you're not Iggy Pop , so put on a damn shirt ! 
If the modern world underestimates three things , it underestimates : Soul Music , Motown , and The Temptations . 
If I've told you once , I've told you a million times : I didn't shoot the freakin ' deputy !!!!!!!! 
I LOVE MUSIC SO MUCH IT HURTS !!!!!!!!!!! 
Coolness , I finished my homework at a reasonable time ! Goodnight ! 
Alright , whoever here is in my Algebra 2 class raise your hands . Okay , now who knows what the homework is ? 
I miss < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > so much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
It feels like autumn outside . I love it . :D <3 
Can I take my shoes off , < PROPMALE > ? Holy cabooses !!!! < PROPFEMALE > Ichniowski <3 
All-nighters for the lose . This'll be an intereseting night ... 
I don't know whether it's too late at night or too early in the morning , but whatever the case , it is 2:10 am , and my brain is no longer functioning . 
New York City <3 
Just got back from New York City with her homies . I <3 them . :D Got some < PROPFIRST > Sinatra and The Tempts vinyl , so I'm , pretty happy about that . :D And < PROPFIRST > Day's album , Parrot Stories , is love . <3 
Am I a tricholtillomaniac ? I think that is a big possibility ... 
And I should know , ' cause I am a horticulturist . I have a husband and three children down in Lexington , Mass . And my ex-boyfriend can't tell me I've sold out . Because he's in a cult . And he's not allowed to talk to me . 
Is sick and weighing the suckiness of going to school sick against the suckiness of making up work ... :( 
is not going to school tomorrow , and is going to bed now . I would be happy if I didn't feel like crap so much . :( 
is too sick to enjoy her day off of school . Bleh . :( 
Did ya miss me ?!... you don't have to answer that . Actually , don't answer it at all . I preferr that my insignificance go unconfirmed . 
Drama homework . :| 
Why is everone a turkey baster today ? 
Trying to speed write an essay . It's not working . 
I blame my ADHD 
They had the script of \Angels In America\ " in the school library . I checked it out . I am now the happiest girl alive . " 
People all over the world ! Join in ! Start a love train , love train ! All of you brothers over in Africa , tell all the folks in Egypt , and < PROPMALE > , too ! Please don't miss this train at the station ! ' Cause if you miss it , I feel sorry , sorry for you ! 
Maybe I should do my homework ... 
Sipping hot tea , listening to Motown records , reading Angels In < PROPFEMALE > . Today is a good day . 
Should be working . Whatever , I missed an episode of Ugly < PROPFEMALE > . I'm still holding on to that as my last link to normalcy : the tradition of watching a tv show ritually . 
I <3 < PROPFIRST > Cooke . And < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . And < PROPFIRST > my < PROPMALE > Jr. And < PROPMALE > Redding . And < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . And < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . And < PROPMALE > Stubbs . And Nat \King\ " < PROPMALE > . Are you catching the pattern here ? " 
I thought it was fool proof . I guess I was wrong . 
Debate . <3 We're pretty much amazing . Just got back from the tournament , which I left for at 6:50 . Yes , I just spent Saturday like a school day , except that the ice cream machine was on all day , and it was 4.5 hours longer . And I spent the day walking from the 3rd floor to the cafeteria and back again . 
Humans are stupid , but I love them . 
Darn it . Stupid Broncos just scored . :( 
Campbell needs to stop passing incompletes . I swear , half of his passes are incomplete . 
Yay ! 14-14 
Feild goal !! 17-17 . 
Touchdown !!!!!!!!!!! 24-17 !!! :D 
Redskins beat Broncos 27-17 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woohoo ! 
Pretty sunset . :) 
Oh my , I actually have to do homework now !!! Oops ... 
Then I go to my brother and I say brother help me please , but he winds up knockin ' me back down on my knees . Oh , there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long , but now I think I'm able to < PROPFEMALE > on . It's been a long , a long time comin ' , but I know a change gonna come , oh yes it will . :'( RIP < PROPFIRST > Cooke . 
It's too late to turn back now , I beleive , I believe , I believe I'm fallin ' in love ! It's too late for me , but you can still be free if you leave now , and don't look back , my love . 
I wish I could be the person everybody thinks that I'm not . Surrender to an image and your personality becomes lost . I wish I could stop reacting badly when you speak to me , push away reaction and just show you what I want you to see . I don't want to be the one who always leaves you out in the rain . Every time I try I always end up making the same mistakes . 
In this everchanging world , it's nice to know that some things will never change . And some people will never grow up . :) <3 
?? I'm in love with a welshman , and his name is Ianto !?? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , you're kind of amazing . Just letting you know , ' cause , ya know , I love ya ! <3 
If you wanna know , if he loves ya so , it's in his kiss . * That's where it is ! * Oh , it's in his kiss ! 
Just one look , and I knew that you were my only one , ohhhh . I thought I was I dreamin ' , but I was wrong , yeah , yeah , yeah , but I'm gonna keep on scheming til I can make you , make you my oooooown . 
And then she said ... ' Just because you've become a young man now . There's still some things that you don't understand now . Before you ask some girl for her hand now . Keep your freedom for as long as you can now ' My mama told me ... ' you better shop around ' 
It even makes you happy when your feeling blue 
People all over the world , join hands , start a love train , love train 
is reading up on making the hajji , with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > blasting . :) I am happy with my mother's decision to keep all of her college textbooks . I totally forgot she majored in sociology . :D 
Could it be I'm falling in love with you ? 
Is this love that I'm feelin' ? 
I love nerds . They make me happy inside . 
What becomes of the broken-hearted ? Who have love that's now departed . I know I've got to find , some kind of peace of mind . Help me please ! 
\I finally did something about it . But was it the right thing ? \"" 
I'm stuck on the stupid computer . It annoys me . I can't even chat on this thing . Bleh . Whatever , I have my < PROPFIRST > Sinatra album , so I'm happy . :D <3 
No I would not give you false hope , on this strange and mournful day , but the mother and child reu-nion is only a motion away . 
Oh , am I fooling you ? Do you fall for it all , or do you just see right through ? Are you as cool as yopu believe ? 
And I never knew before , but I feel like a child in a cold , cold war . So strong , so tough sitting in surburbia , waiting for the wind up . And I don't wanna dance , I just wanna jump from the prison of circumstance . Why am I thinking of , you and me and the labour of love ? 
is wallowing in self-pity . I need to stop . Seriously . I'm becoming way too self-absorbed . Tell me your problems , so I can start having real pity please . KThanxBai !!! 
I have my books , and my poetry to protect me ; I am shielded in my armor . Hiding in my room , safe within my womb , I touch no one and no one touches me . I am a rock , I am an island . And a rock feels no pain ; and an island never cries . 
I am just a poor girl , though my story's seldom told . I have squandered my resistance for a pocket full of mumbles such are promises , all lies and jests . Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest . 
Every time I think of you I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue . Every day my confusion grows . Every time I see you falling I get down on my knees and pray . I'm waiting for that final moment , you'll say the words that I can't say . 
Exquisite dead guy , rotating in his display case . Exquisite dead guy , swear I saw his mouth move . Ba ba da ba ba ba da ba . Ba ba da ba ba ba da ba . Ba ba da ba ba ba da ba . Ba ba da ba ba ba da ba . How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel !!!!!! About you ! 
It envelopes you in it's warmth , but you know that if you let it continue on , it will begin to control you . You allow yourself to be lulled into a false sense of peace and security , knowing full well the consequences . And yet you can't keep it from consuming you , and soon it controls you . But is it a disease , or just a soft blanket ? And what lies after the long sleep ? 
I love hot chocolate ! And soul music ! And I have both , so I'm happy ! :D 
I love my friends ! :) <3 Thank you ! :D <3 
So lost and scared , I cannot say . These are the days we will remember , but what if I choose the wrong thing ? I don't know anymore , whereas I used to be so sure . Always moving and going nowhere . I'm at the edge of the < PROPMALE > , one wrong step and I'll tumble down . 
This is where the party ends , ' cause I can't stand here listening to you and your racist friend . I know that politics bore you , but I feel like a hypocrite talking to you , you and your racist friend . 
Mr. Horrible , Mr. Horrible ! Telephone call for Mr. Horrible ! It's the Ugliness Man , Mr. Horrible ! 
Sorry darlings , my chat isn't working very well , I'm not ignoring you ! I'll be on the good computer in a hour or so , so you can wait ' til then , or just Gmail chat me . I think my Gmail is on my profile ... maybe . :D 
Dinner , maybe my chat will work properly after a nice reboot ! :P :D 
Haha , elena : \Someone needs to throw some da*m water on that effin ' boy ! \ " ILY ! <3 " 
Why is it so hard , why do I have to stress this much ? I never wanted this , but now I have to justify my need of justification . This train can't take me anywhere , but I'll keep waiting for it to move . And it seems like it goes on like this forever , and I'm cryin , ain't I ? 
is conflicted like no one's business . Xandi < PROPMALE > thank you for putting up with my conflictedness and self-pity ! <3 
Ain't no mountain high enough , ain't no valley low enough , ain't no river wide enough , to keep me from gettin ' to you babe . No wind , no rain , nor winter's cold can stop me , if you're my goal . 
The Thriller just came on my Motown station on Pandora ! 
Of course my affection's super illustrated and I like to give ; don't reciprocate it , unless you could give me someone innovated . Well lets cook it up , we don't refrigerate it . But back to the country of the educated where people get robbed and they celebrate it . 
The streets here have < PROPFIRST > , the buildings in blocks , but none of the street signs are pointing to you . I've seen a whole different world , but now the sky's getting darker , the air getting cooler , and I just can't win anymore . So forgive me my darling , we all have impossible dreams . :( 
Leaving for Twelfth Night at Marritt's Ridge , back at 10:30 ! :D <3 
I'm not anitsocial !!!!!! I just ... don't like to talk to people that I don't know ... 
And , at 11:16 pm , < PROPFEMALE > embarks on the perilous task of doing her homework ! 
And so you see I have come to doubt , all that I once held as true . I stand alone without beliefs . The only truth I know is you . And as I watch the drops of rain , weave their weary paths and die , I know that I am like the rain : There but for the grace of you go I . <3 
Away , I'd rather sail away , like a swan that's here and gone . A man gets tied up to the ground . He gives the world its saddest sound . I'd rather be a < PROPMALE > than a street . Yes I would . If I could , I surely would . I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet , yes I would . If I only could , I surely would . 
For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers . Their laughter and their loveliness could clear a cloudy day . And the song that I am singing is a prayer to non-believers . Come and stand beside us ; we can find a better way . 
Don't be scared . Don't be scared to love , better to love than never love at all . Don't be scared . Don't be shy . Don't be shy to tell , you may lose the < PROPMALE > to tell . Don't be shy . 
now knows how to drive ! Basically , it's like Bop It ! \Spin it ! Bop it ! Twist it ! Flick it ! Pull it ! \ " = \ " Spin the wheel ! Bop the horn ! Twist the windsheild wiper thingy ! Flick your turn signal on ! Pull the gear shift ! \"" 
These are the days , the days we will remember , so come away with me and see what the world has to offer us . 
Noooooooo ! My Pandora reached its 40 hour limit for November !!!!!!! 
If only angels could prevail , we'd be the the way way we were . Wake up ! Unnerve the bright red day ! We learn to say goodbye . 
I wish I could be the person everybody thinks that I'm not . Surrender to an image and your personality becomes lost . Every time I try I always end up making the same mistakes . I wish I could stop reacting badly when you speak to me , push away reaction and just show you what I want you to see . 
This is the drowning horse song . * drowning horse noise * It features the drowning horse . * drowning horse noise * It is the drowning horse song . * drowning horse noise * And it hasn't got a cow in it ... * moooooooooo * ... yes it does . 
I remember how we were before you became intoxicating . I remember how we were before I could feel my will escaping . I remember how we were before my mind was inundated , with wishes of you getting lost in me . 
Ushering Noises Off ! 
Noises Off = Fantastic ! 
is sick . :( Hopefully I'll get better by tomorrow . I hate make-up work . Though I guess we won't be doing much ... 
Darn it skins , so close , so close . Ugh . 
Will humans be dumb and free or some amazing catastrophe ? Never too scared to bare , to care , to running to the riot , where the moment meets the most beautiful thing I know . And the most beautiful thing is something new , I dunno why . I know all there is , I know . 
We must have free will , we have no choice . 
I wish I could stop reacting badly when you speak to me . Push away reaction and just show you what I want you to see . I don't want to be the one who's always getting in your way . If I let you go , you could be better for it anyway . 
is sicker than yesterday . :( I think that all of my enzymes are denatured by now . :( Fill me in on the homework , por favor . :D 
I wonder when you guys come home from school ... 
Wow , being sick is kind of suckish . :( 
has to go play \Where In The World Is < PROPFIRST > Sandiego ? \"" 
< PROPFIRST > Sandiego kept freezing , so I came back to the internet . Stupid 8 year old computer games that require Windows 95 . 
Dear people with whom I am chatting : excuse me for a moment as I reboot my computer . 
is not on facebook . Sorry . 
My ears hurt . Because I have a sore throat . Don't you hate that ? 
I can't promise that I'll find a way with you . I can't promise . No , I can't promise that I'll love you . But I'd like to get to know you ( yes I would ) , yes I'd like to get to know you ( If I could ) . I'd like to get to know you . 
Is still sick , bleh . I actually kind of wanted to go to career day , but whatever . Ha , I just realized that my peers will be home in around an hour , and I just woke up . :) 
Soup = Best part of being sick . :P Yummy ! :D 
Welcome home people ! Did you enjoy school ? :P 
can't find her phone . :| 
I have come to a conclusion . The < PROPMALE > Brothers are completely insane . 
D , world destruction . Over and overture . N , do I need . Apostrophe T , need this torture ? 
Facebook is really starting to annoy me . Sorry people I'm chatting , apparently my connection isn't cool enough for fb chat . :P 
The < PROPFIRST > Lopez marathon on NickAtNite makes me happy . :)

I'm a sucker for stability , which might come as a surprise , but I can't help but love the way you smile to one side . C = 
Why is it always like this ? 10:30 and a pile of homework in front of me . :( 
Oh school , what would I do witgout you ? Oh , I know , lay around the house and play poker and watch TV and play Beatles RockBand . :P

Square pegs , square pegs , square , square pegs . Always never quite right . Square pegs , square pegs , square , square pegs . I'd like it if they liked us , but I don't think they like us . Square pegs , square pegs , square , square pegs . So tell me where's the party , and how come we weren't invited ? Square pegs , square pegs , square , square pegs . One size does not fit all . 
Turn around , turn around , there's a thing there that can be found . Turn around , turn around , it's a human skull on the ground . Human skull , on the ground , turn around . 
So close to finishing my homework . So close ! :) 
Half of the time we're gone but we dont know where , and we dont know where .

There is so much amazing music in this world . It makes me feel nice inside . :) 
I'm tempted to stay up really late tonight , just for the satisfaction of listening to \Wednesday Morning 3 A . M . \ " at 3 am on Wednesday morning . That's probably the part of me that got excited when \ " Ruby Tuesday\ " came on at 12:01 am yesterday night/this morning . :D " 
The 21st century is when it all changes . And we've got to be ready . 
Just pwned LoP part 2 ! Oh yeah , I officially have no life !

If you give a mouse a cookie ... 
Off to play Beatles RockBand ! 
Back from debate , homework and practicing for Wedding Singer auditions . :) <3 
I just realized that I'm going back to my school for my brother's middle school band concert . :) 
Just got back from the middle school concert , and now I miss middle school . :( Don't get me wrong , I love Resi & all my new friends , but I miss all my friends who went to Atown and Hammond , and Mr. Reinhardt and Ms. < PROPFEMALE > and all the hammond middle teachers , and all my friends in 7th and 8th grade this year . I'm getting all nostalgic . :P 
About to go to Cheeburger Cheeburger !!!

My feet are * still * growing ! You would think that once they got to the unlucky- well ... * luck-related * number of 13 (!!) that they would stop , but no , they are giving no implications of ceasing growing . The only shoes in the mall that are in my size and I would actually would wear in public are Chucks , because they are unisex , so they have bigger sizes for guys ! 
Trying to practice for The Wedding Singer auditions ... by singing Once On This Island songs ? Not even remotely close song styles , but hey , it's still Broadway , ain't it ? :P 
If anyone sees any GIANT RED BALLOONS tethered to the ground text me at 240-547-7159 ( or if you don't have texting call 301-362-0011 ) please ! Please include the number on the balloon and an address or street intersection near it ! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > much , this is for a competition for $ 40,000 all for a < PROPFEMALE > ! DFTBA !

So we'll be watching scenes take place where we are sitting !!!! So cool ! * nerd * :D " 
Just take a deep breath and let it all go . But if it comes back , and your wellbeing continues to be attacked , then walk away from all of the lies and deceit , and be free . 
Tonight's gonna be a long night . Bleh . :P 
I'm thinking about you right now . I've been doing that more lately . PS : Auditions were good , congrats to everyone who went today ! 
is taking a nap , so don't bother me ! 
You're the only thing that's keeping me going . 
My last name is Ball . 
You may be right , I may be crazy , but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for . :D :P <3 
just went outside and caught snow with her tongue . I had to come back in because of an eye-related injury . \I can do so many things with my tongue !!!!!!! \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > "

I love you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D <3 
Forgive me my darling , we have impossible dreams ... <3 
Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where , and we don't know where . 
Just had to go out into the freezoing cold darkness with a wrench and flashlight to fix the internet ... grrrr .... 
We learn to say goodbye 
Callbacks were cool , barely did anything though , except for the lead , which I probably am not getting . Whatever , the only part in my range is < PROPFIRST > anyway . :) Yay for the ensemble !!!!!!!!!!!!! :D <3 
Homewoooooooooooooooooooooooork . Yup . I propcrastinate chronically . Whatever , I'm already half done . :D 
We give our problems to the sea , but they'll be back for you and me . In our haste , we forget , leaving our mistakes behind . Out of sight is out of mind . Our disposable mankind , what a waste . 
I feel like an intellectual . :) 
Struggling to surrender 
I'm trying to tell you something about my life , maybe give me insight between black and white . The best thing you've ever done for me is to help me take my life less seriously , it's only life after all . Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable and lightness has a call that's hard to hear . I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it , I'm crawling on your shore . 
Experiencing problems ... yup , that pretty much sums it up . :) 
I apologize if I seem a bit standoffish in chat or don't answer your texts , I have a headache like you would not believe . Bleh . :P Have a nice life ! <3 :D 
I want to go to sleep . 
There's more than one answer to these questions , pointing me in crooked line . The less I seek my source for some definitive , the closer I am to fine . 
Oh no !!! I just found out that < PROPFIRST > Travers of < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > died this September ! While listening to their song \Early Mornin ' Rain\ " ! :'( " 
The passing of time and all of its sickening crimes is making me sad again . But don't forget the songs that made you cry and the songs that saved your life . <3 
Stop complaining about teachers and the work they give . Teachers are human too ! It's their job to discipline you . Don't be so damn rude ! Get over it , they aren't going to let you step all over ' em . And yeah , they give a lot of work , but it's their job , and you're gonna have to work in the real world , so don't be so damn lazy ! 
Why is it all so ... why can't I ... why do I ... Unfinished questions left dangling in my mind What is right , what is wrong , what fits , what is good , what is bad Relativity Only one thing is really certain 
I'm feeling kind of 80's , listening to my Cure and Nik Kershaw . :) <3 
Am I scaring you away or are you as confused as I ? Tell me please , because it's never been like this for me before . 
Gahhhh , bio extra credit . It confuzzles mah brains . And makes me feel like I'm not smarter than a 4th grader . Which is not a happy feeling . 
My sanity is gradually slipping away ... 
I’m not a complex person , wind me up and watch me go . You’ll always be second to my love for the unknown . And it’s too late for me , but you can still be free if you leave now , and don’t look back , my love . 
I'm trying to do my homework really fast !!!!! ... it's not working ... 
I don’t know much of my life . But I know , I want people to know : maybe I might sing along , as if , this was only a song . But now the sky’s getting darker , the air getting cooler , and I just can’t win anymore . So forgive me , my darling , we all have impossible dreams . 
Argh !!! My dad forgot I had the gift exchange dinner thingy !!! Can anyone give me a ride ? I doubt it , but it never hurts to ask . :) 
I <3 mah girl scout sistahs . :P I can't spell today . :P :D <3 
I just saw a tutuorial on YouTube enititled \Como Usar OpenOffice . \ " I was so excited because I knew what it meant . :D * nerd * " 
Wanna go to bed , but I need to finish writing stuff yeah . You didn't know it , but that was a song in my head . Yeah , my sanity is going down the drain right about now ... :P 
I'm decreasing WorldSuck ! Join the Project for Awesome right now ! Go to YouTube and search for Project for Awesome 2009 , and watch a bunch of videos ! It's very inspiring , because they are all about charities ! :D <3 DFTBA ! ( Don't forget to be awesome ! ) 
I hate ignorance . Makes me want to punch someone . 
Today was a bad day , and I'm anticipating tomorrow being worse . :( Whatever , I'll get over it . :) 
But I'd like to get to know you , yes I would . But I'd like to get to know you , if I could . Yes I'd like to get to know youuuu . :) <3 
Is it just me , or has this week been suckish and kind of depressing ? * sigh * Have a great weekend everyone ! <3 
I tried to lower my gaze . It didn't work . Now I can't stop banging my head on the wall . Just sitting here , waiting . 
Did you know that the United States is one of only * two * countries in the < PROPFEMALE > ( the only country not in the < PROPFEMALE > is North Korea ... ) along with Somalia that did not ratify the Childrens Rights Convention ! Yup , we have no legal rights . Sucks for us . :P 
Donating to < PROPFEMALE > ! :D <3 Miss you . <3 
I'm not that good at writing , but I thought you should know : every song's about you cause you're everything I know . <3 
Mah chat is not working !!! All of the cars on our driveway resemble giant marshmallows . :D 
Kidz Bop Sings The Beatles ???? Really , really ? * shakes head *

The federal government is closed on Monday , and they NEVER close . The last time they closed was during the 2003 blizzard ! HoCo will probably close too then , so don't freak out guys , they never post it until the early morning . 
HoCo is clooooooosed ! :D

Haul out the < PROPFEMALE > ; now well I taught you all to live each living day ! 
No school tomorrow . That makes sense . More time for cleaning . Yay ... do I sound excited to you ? ' Cause I'm not .

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars , when we have learned what Christmas is for . When we have found what life's really worth , there'll be peace on earth . < PROPMALE > 5 <3 
My eye is inflamed and I have to go to the doc tomorrow . :( But now I get to play Where in the World is < PROPFIRST > Sandiego ? I feel like a little kid . :D <3 
Just please remember the songs that made you cry , the songs that made you smile , remember the songs that saved your life all those years ago . 
Why do I always seem to be fixing my internet in my pijamas , bear feet , and a coat ? 
Why do I always seem to be fixing my internet in my pijamas , bare feet , and a coat ? 
Just had to take down my smoke alarm , look up the < PROPMALE > online , and take out the battery , because it was chirping so loud . Ten minutes of my life , wasted because * someone * didn't replace the alarm from 1999 in ten years , like you're supposed to . :P

Oh , and it's alright , it's all right , it's all right , you can't be forever blessed . Still , tomorrow's going to be another working day and I'm trying to get some rest . That's all I'm trying to get some rest . :)

And you're stuck ; you can't do anything but accept the past and decide what to do with what you have been given . 
Everywhere I go , I get slander , libel ! I hear words I never heard in the Bible ! And I'm one step ahead of the shoeshine , two steps away from the county line . I'm just tryin ' to keep the customer satisfied , satisfied !

I wish I could do a lot of things that I can't and be a lot of things that I'm not , but I'll always be myself , yes I'll give me all I've got . 
Oh , I'm going to listen to my 45's , ain't it wonderful to be alive , when the rock ' n ' roll plays , when the memory stays ! I'm keeping the faith , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , keeping the faith ! 
A sad fact widely known : the most impassionate song to a lonely soul is so easily outgrown . But dont forget the songs that made you smile , and the songs that made you cry , when you lay in awe , on the bedroom floor . 
It all becomes clear as the tides wash away . 
OMGBeggezez , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > + Lady Gaga = epic ? I think so . :D <3

Opening night , like you didn't know already . ^_^ Come and see the Wedding Singer , it's gonna be gorgeus and hilarious and beautiful and amazing and fantabulous . ^_^ 
One size fits all seems to be their thinking's lowdown ! That barely works for socks , why would it work for mental breakdowns ??????? 
The number of my online friends just shot up to 71 . The chorus people must be back now . * prepares for onslaught * 
Why is Flood such an amazing album ? ... well , probably because TMBG is such an amazing band ... * sings \Particle Man\ " and \ " Lucky Ball and Chain \"*" 
Weird day , kind of confusing , but mostly boring ... 
So why do they keep talking at me , telling me that I’m the one who’s wrong ; One size fits all would seem to be their thinking’s lowdown , but it barely works for socks , why would it work for mental breakdowns ? And they say you’ll never love me , the way that I love you . But they’ve not been right so far , so I think , that I’ll continue toooooo * mental breakdown * 
Gah , stupid old computer is stupid and old . And my trichiliomania is really bad right now . And today has been really confusing and emotionally/mentally exhausting . So you might say I'm ready for it to be tomorrow .... 
Just spent the last hour watching TEDTalks ( basically lectures about interesting stuff by geniuses for geniuses :D ) , and I feel much better . ^_^ I love being a socially inadequate nerd with a lot of free time again . ^_^ So , how was your day ? <3

I'm totally going to see Weezer and < PROPMALE > Folds in April ! There is NO way I'm going to miss that ! 
I remember when there were only 150 of you ; well , technically 151 if you are counting Mew , but I digress , I guess I spent the best years of my little life ( didn't get out much ) surfing Cinnabar Island to get 126 Revives ! And I miss the Pokémon Center , I miss its music too . And the way that Snorlax looked like Lapras on water . Pokémon , what happened to you ? 
I just realized that I match every statement in the Sinatra song \The Lady Is A Tramp . \ " Win . <3 "

I'm sorry for what my people did to your people , all those years ago , so please don't hate me ! <3 
Rock and roll come and save me ! Yeah , I listen to Rancid .... don't judge me ! :P 
You're certainly not making this any easier on me ; imagine how hard it will be to say goodbye . This ain't how they said it would be when they told me love was all you needed , back when we were all younger and freer and searching for a reason and a saviour . 
<3 for Ianto !!!!!!!!!!! He's kind of the love of my lfe . Just sayin . :P ^_^

Now I know how < PROPFIRST > of Arc , as the flames < PROPFEMALE > to her < PROPMALE > nose , and her Walkman started to melt . 
I miss holding down the B button when I thought it made it easier , I miss surfing to the truck and using Strength to try and move it , I miss watching my Charmander evolve into a Charmeleon , I won’t accept your Leaf Green , they’ll always be Red and Blue to me ! 
Don't forget the songs that made you cry , and the songs that saved your life . Yes you're older now , and you're a clever swine , but they were the only ones that ever stood by you ! Oooooooh , do you love me like you used to ? 
Yay for procrastination on the bio project ! /chronic sarcasm

I'll be wearing ribbons down my back , this summer . Blue & green and streaming in the yellow sky , so if someone special comes my way this summer , he might notice me passing by ; and so , I'll try to make it easier to find me , because a breeze might stir a rainbow up behind me , that might happen to catch the gentleman's eye . 
Out there , there's a world outside of Yonkers ! Way out there beyond this hick town , Barnaby , there's a slick town , Barnaby ! Out there , full of shine and full of < PROPFEMALE > !

Duran Duran just came on my Smiths radio . Oh Pandora ... 
I was looking through the Roud Folk Song Index , as I sometimes do , because I am a complete nerd , and I realized the strange occurrence of a character named William/ < PROPFIRST > /Sweet < PROPFIRST > , who is oft accompanied by a Lady/Lovely Margaret/Mary or < PROPFEMALE > Allan/Allen .

Oh my God #Libya and #Gaddafi and Im so freaked out I can't think . Seriously , if you haven't heard about what's happening right now , google . 
I was going to tweet about the frozen rain that is falling on my window BUT OH MY FREAKING GOD #LIBYA SERIOUSLY WTF #GADDAFI 
So like , if you didn't know , across the world in an African country called Libya , soldiers , on the orders of an awful dictator , are in the streets killing innocent , peaceful civilian protesters . Right now . AT THIS VERY MOMENT . WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING OUTSIDE TO SEE THE SLEET . Just thought you should know , facebook . 
Hello , this is me freaking out about how Gaddafi is currently bombing his own country in order to violently cut down peaceful protesters . I ... I don't understand . ;( 
Americans always seem to talk about dying for their freedom . That's what the Libyan protesters are doing right now . 
If you don't know about the terrible things happening in Libya these are the basics : http://t.co/9UOmZBF 
sorry to burden your ignorant news feeds with depressing things but #thisiswhatishappening \nobody should morally be able to order people to go into hospitals and shoot people . that is just not an okay thing to do as a human being \"" 
You need me like the wind needs the trees to blow in , like the < PROPFEMALE > needs poetry , you need me . 
With everything happening in Northern Africa , plus the awful earthquakes in New Zealand , I feel like 12/21/12 is coming early . #ifiwascrazy 
Oh my God , Gaddafi is giving a speech , and basically , he is claiming that those who were protesting in Libya were drugged teenagers who don't know anything about history and want to emulate those in Egypt . This is awful stuff , really awful . 
Basically , he's threatening people with punishment by death if they do anything other than sit quietly in there houses and do nothing . 
Holy God the Drousy Chaperone omfg best show !!!!!!!!!!! #theatrenerd

This is probably the longest I've gone without texting < PROPFIRST > Zang Vasquez for 8 hours ... oh my god ... this is so weird ... * phone vibrates * Crisis averted ! 
Me + < PROPFIRST > Zang Vasquez + < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > = #winning all night long 
Yes , my status does have 194 comments . Facebook isn't malfunctioning , I'm just that awesome . And I have a lot of friends . Oh yeaahhh . 
Your face is stupid . 
< PROPFIRST > Zang Vasquez Where did I put my phone ? Nobutsrsly , where is it ???? 
I am NOT cute ! I'm MANLY ! GET IT RIGHT ! 
Don’t you ever ask them why , if they told you , you would cry ; so just look at them and sigh , and know they love you . 
Where is my phone , seriously , where is my phone , sorry < PROPFIRST > Zang Vasquez , but seriously where the eff is my bloody PHONE ! 
Like this if I like you . 
I've got to admit it's getting better , a little better all the time . I have to admit its getting better , it's getting better , since you've been mine . 
Love sees love's happiness but happiness can't see that love is sad , that love is sad . Sadness is hanging there to show love somewhere something needs a change , they need a change 
I'll stop the world and melt with you . You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time . There's nothing you and I won't do . I'll stop the world and melt with you ! <3 
When I'm walking beside her , people tell me I'm lucky . Yes , I know I'm a lucky guy . I remember the first time I was lonely without her . Can't stop thinking about her now . 
I just had this awful thought that , because my phone is basically one year old , it will just happen to break right now , and I won't know what to do . 
When I walk down the street , most guys look like elves . I don't mean to put them down but they do . It's hard to understand me from the language I use ; there's no word in English for my style . What's a man like me supposed to do with all this extra savoir-faire ? What is left for me to prove , dear ? 
< PROPFEMALE > BROWN AND < PROPMALE > LIVENGOOD STOP SPAMMING MY FEED ! GO BACK TO 4CHAN ! Gaaaarrrrgggghhhh * giant squid of anger * #jkily 
So we've determined that BabyFiona was about the best thing ever , and I feel I should attempt to emulate her . And when I say we I mean me and one other person ... okay so mainly me ... #ImReallyCoolYouDontEven 
I feel as though someone ( anyone ) should text me , because * someone else * is stupid and has to rehearse for a musical or whatever ... lame ... 
I keep searching for an answer , but , it just ain't there . And I don't want to live this life , and I don't want to live this life , and I don't want to live this life anymore . 
Okay , I'm officially too tired to keep flipping records ; it's time to switch to Pandora , my musical saviour . 
Why are The Temptations on my < PROPMALE > Croce station ? Not that I ever mind some Temptations in my life ... but still ... < PROPMALE > Croce ? Really ? 
Dear < PROPFIRST > Zang Vasquez , I would love it if you give me more warning than that before raping my phone . I seriously thought I was under attack ... so much buzzing ... 
Every little thing's a domino that falls on different dots , and crashes into everything that tries to make it stop . 
So tonight was ... interesting ... one would think that girls ' incessant chatter and speculation would grow tiring , but no . :P 
Oh deviantART and all your trollfaceness . TGIAFD , I needed some more meme in my life . #I <3 theInternet 
Hired a priest to give light to your soul . No friends attended it , you were alone . They'd been too busy attending their own . 
A little shy , and sad of eye , but very wise was he . And then one day , a magic day he passed my way , and while we spoke of many things , fools and kings , this he said to me : the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return .
