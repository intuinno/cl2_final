Just have faith . I was told I'd see . \ 
The light from above shining down on me . \ 
Like a frog in a pond . Flashlight in my eyes . \ 
Who knows if the lights in disguise ? \ 
Blind acceptance but who makes the rules ? \ 
Decisions are hard but you need to choose . \ 
Because right is right and wrong is wrong . \ 
The way to salvation is long . \ 
Maybe not much . \ 
I won't use the church as a crutch . 
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed when you say ' best friends ' means friends forever . Tell me what you got away with ! Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish!I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids ! Have another drink and drive yourself home ! I hope there's ice on all the roads ! And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt then when your head goes through the windshield ! 
Oh have you not heard ? Because it was my understanding that everyone had heard .. 
Well make sure to build your home brick by boring brick\ 
or the wolf's gonna blow it down . 
A dying man needs to die , as a sleepy man needs to \ 
sleep , and there comes a time when it is wrong , as well as useless , to \ 
resist .

When I was one-and-twenty I heard a wise man say ' Give crowns and pounds and guineas , but not your heart away give pearls away and rubies , But keep your fancy free . But I was one-and-twenty , no use to talk to me .
