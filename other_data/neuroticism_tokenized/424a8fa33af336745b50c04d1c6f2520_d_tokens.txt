is typing a status ... 
Please put this on your status if you know someone who has been eaten by a dragon . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... 
When you imitate people you don't like .. you tend to give them ridiculous voices ...

Spending the night with Maths . Sigh . Can't wait until this nonsense is over . 
You know what ? Screw studying . Gonna watch Lion < PROPMALE > 2 :) 
MATRIC BIO STUDENTS- So there I was , watching TV instead of studying , and I landed - by accident - on channel 319 ( Mindset Learn ) its going through our sections for the exam and its pretty darn useful !! :) 
My study breaks are always longer than the actual time I spend studying ... 
Can't wait until 4 months from now ... when I will ERASE all things Mathematical in my head . Everything . Trig . Calculus . Linear . All that nonsense . And all I will remember is the ability to add and subtract because , guess what , THAT'S ALL I'LL EVER NEED TO KNOW IN LIFE >:( 
Study study study ... 
Mom : When are you going to study for LO ? \

' < PROPFIRST > Cullen tries to commit suicide by sparkling . What . There's not one single person on the face of the earth who would see a man sparkling and think \OH MY GOODNESS VAMPIRES ARE REAL ! \ " ' XD " 
Vampires Suck = HILARIOUS movie :P absolutely loved it ! Twilight got pwned :D 
Othello should've ' taken out ' < PROPFEMALE > Buchanan instead ... 
{ Cause I've had the time of my life , and I've searched through every open door until I found the truth and I owe it all to you } 
{ There's a world outside every darkened door , where Blues won't haunt you anymore , the brave are free and lovers soar } 
Gone insane , brb . 
Eid Mubarak for yesterday , Muslim friends :)

Native American Indians used to name their children after the first thing they saw as they left their tepees after the birth . Hence such strange names as \Sitting Bull\ " and \ " Running Water\ " . That really had to suck . Imagine being named \ " Mud\ " or ... \ " Stick \"."
