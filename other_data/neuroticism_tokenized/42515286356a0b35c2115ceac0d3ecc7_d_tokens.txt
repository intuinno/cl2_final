I don't really know what people do on social networking websites . 

Has anyone ever really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? 
thoroughly nuked his PCs partition table , and Windows 7 won't install . Ubuntu works good though . 
successfully re-installed Windows 7 , after removing almost all RAM from the computer . Linux is still the < PROPMALE > of stability , though . 
had his power supply fail after one month . Trouble ticket w/ Antec opened . 
If I have ventured wrongly , very well , life then helps me with its penalty . But if I haven't ventured at all , who helps me then ? 
In the mountains of truth you will never climb in vain : either you will get up higher today or you will exercise your strength so as to be able to get up higher tomorrow . 
Against boredom even gods struggle in vain . 
Gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars , for the first time , the first , I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe . 
One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others , by means of love , friendship , indignation and compassion . 
The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently . 
Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself ; if all it does is maintain itself , then living is only not dying .

Enlightenment is man’s leaving his self-caused immaturity . Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another . 
Senior Project . -_- 
Coming up on 36 hours of being awake ... I should go to bed . 
The program was written in C++ for Windows XP . ... Now what do I say ? -_- 
My Sr. Project segments are now complete . 
I hold high standards for other people . It would be nice if I could actually be apathetic sometimes . Truly apathetic . 
I SO hope I just helped some Malware spread . 
Comp . Org . & Arch . finished . Random Signals next . 
Finals finished monday . Forgot to mention . \

Scored 3 points more on the final than necessary to get an A in Comp . Org . 
Packing up for summer relocation , only to pack up for fall and spring . \ 
-_- 
Graduation day ! 
Semester over , final grades available , and the university hasn't bothered to update my units or GPA yet . Fortunately , I know how it's all \calculated . \"" 
Time to start homework for tomorrow . Brainstorming a program I'm gonna write , maybe translate it to being an iPhone/iPad app . Need to look into Blackberry development .

First time the pic was actually , you know , a picture of me . 
August 3 , in Oakland . Silversun Pickups with The < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > People and Against Me !. \ 
I'll be there . 
Making Genealogical progress . 
Turns out I'm decent with a . 41 Magnum ... did better with that than the Beretta ( 9mm ) 
Need to start packing , as UOP IS going to require me to move again ... and I need to start wearing sunblock if I'm going to swim in the late morning/early afternoon . I was getting away with not using sunblock ' cus I had been swimming later in the day ( around 7pm ) . \ 
Aloe is now my friend . 
I hate when people get angry at me for telling them the truth . The only reason I avoid lying to people ( out-right or by omission ) is because I think it is wrong . So if I go out of my way to be honest , at least appreciate that I think you're valuable enough to be honest with . \ 
Note : unrelated to today or this weekend . 
So while translating the code on the new building , I got something about \Science Technology Innovation\ " and something about Society ... \ 
People don't think it be like it is , but it do . 
Finally have working internet again . -_- 
The < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > People\ 
check them out . The more I listen , the more I like them . They were awesome live in Oakland last week . 
Dilemma paper finished . 
Thanks everyone ! I took the opportunity to relax , and it felt good . 
feels a little depressed . Probably has something to do with needing to get out of the apartment more . Going for a walk in a few minutes , update later . 
I think I'm gonna become a bartender on the side , at least for the duration of my time in college . Decent pay for the job , and it's something I'm good at . After mixing any cocktail once I know how to make it and after making one or two more I make them very well . 
Going camping , back Monday some time . 
Refrigerator broke . I informed the University before it happened . I offered them a stall , to extend its life a bit . They neither repaired or replaced the device . A lot of ( formerly ) good food got thrown into the trash last night . 
There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn . 
Everything considered , a determined soul will always manage . 
Odd . Fast P2P , but slow browsing . People suggest a problem with DNS . I change my DNS servers to Google's Public DNS with little or no effect . Looks like my replacement for installing network simulators will be debugging my home network ( determining if the problem IS my home netowrk ) and setting up our new printer .

Why ? Why did I do that ? 
Installing ATI Stream SDK . The new driver for ATI has not been ... good to me . I am now hoping that I will not have to roll my driver back , thus killing my ability to use Stream .

3/8-ish . Not including the executive summary at the start , which I'm writing last . 
30+ minutes wasted . Why ? \gloabal\ " isn't the same as \ " global \"."

I love Google Scholar . \ 
I feel stupid for not using it sooner . 
How I know I've been using VIM too much ? \ 
I try to preface my console commands with \: \"" 
Late breaking suppressed news : Australia is cool . 
Augmented reality . I think I'd like to get involved with this . 
Future research : real time data about/analysis of objects , I'm thinking some snazzy glasses . VATS in the real world , coming soon . \ 
Also : telepresence . Control robots remotely , move around where you can not and so forth . 
Listening to : Pendulum\ 
About to go foraging through the California wilderness ( Stockton ) for food . 
Total nerd moment : using VIM and learned a new trick , literally did an arm-pump and said \FUCK YEAH ! \"" 
Just had an epiphany . Awesome . 
New like : Mumford & Sons . \ 
Who knew ? 
Time to resume thesis work . I need a solid first-draft lit review by ... say ... this time next week . That seems like a good , if arbitrary , deadline . I need to get it out of the way so I can work on my multiple simulation projects ... 
So I may not have my lit review completely finished on my previously chosen arbitrary deadline ... mostly due to having put it off for too long , but I have managed to find some gold-mine leads in the field of robotic swarms . \ 
Dr. Bowring : consider yourself warned . \ 
=) 
I may have accidentally a computer science degree ... need to talk to Dr. Doherty . 
Anyone know a good wireless router that provides its owner with a lot or complete control over its functionality ? \ 
I need to pick up a switch in the near future , but I may as well replace my wireless router while I'm at it ( Apple Airport , save the disparaging comments ) . Needs to support 802.11 g , preferably 802.11 b/n as well . 
Someone needs to make a tool for decomposition models . 
Ant project decomposed down 6 layers , and still going . This should make it much easier for me to properly contribute to this project . 
Ants described . Decomposing Terrain . 
Ubuntu : themed . \ 
Windows is next . 
I don't care much for Wheatstone bridge circuits . Sitting in a lab at almost 10PM , and about as much progress as I was seeing at 3PM when I had Dr. Basha to bug for help . \ 
Not giving up yet . But this is certainly ... not cool . I'm sure I will be a master of Wheatstone-debugging by the time this is all done and over with . 
doesn't feel like dealing with today . Regardless , today is here and doing nothing is not an acceptable way of handling the mountain of work I've allowed to build up . Neither is dwelling on how I could have managed things differently to avoid this mess . 
sometimes gets very worn down . I sometimes think of how much easier grad school would be if I didn't have a thesis looming over me . I'd have more time for just about everything . \ 
But if I always took the easy route , I'd probably have a useless degree and be working at some inane job .

Music ( in and out of rehab on this one ) 
I got through all standard ROS tutorials using python . As a treat I'll learn either boost-sockets ( asio . hpp , if I recall ) or graphics ( either GLFW or SDL ) tomorrow . \ 
Tuesday after my meeting with < PROPFIRST > Shields and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > I'll go through the basic C++ tutorials , and the non-standard python tutorials . 
I want a web browser with VIM keybindings . 
Fun project for the next few days ( during down time ): \
