No you don't know what it's like\ 
When nothing feels all right\ 
You don't know what it's like\ 
To be like me\ 
To be hurt\ 
To feel lost\ 
To be left out in the dark\ 
To be kicked when you're down\ 
To feel like you've been pushed around\ 
To be on the edge of breaking down\ 
And no one's there to save you \

thought that the Orphan was a realy messed up movie . I got like half of the way done with it and in just like , it's got so many holes , the girl is just a plain pyscho , and the other characters are just plain stupid/ wrong/ weird . And I know what happens at the end so I don't need to watch the rest of it . 
Definition of skateboarding is it's something that free's your mind from all worries it gives you hope and dreams and goals . It's about the laughter and fun of just chillin with your friends and running from cops and sometimes causeing havic . ( Hey if you bail don't let that stop you from doing something . You get back up and you just keep going for it . Cause ill never give up in skateboarding till my legs fall off . ) 
Skateboarder : a person who chose a cool sport instead of putting on a jockstrap and jumping all over men . 
thought that Due Date was a funny movie . They definetly tried too hard to make it a funny movie , and it was no Hangover . < PROPMALE > ( played by Zach Galifinakis ) is almost a exact copy of The Hangover's < PROPFIRST > . Despite those reasons , < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr. and Zach Galifinakis were an excellent match that had you laugh for a majority of the move . 
thinks that Nerve , and Trip To Insanity rocked the house . Sunday on Saturn , and Carbon 14 were good too 
got a haircut and new glasses 
Holy s@&$ !! < PROPMALE > Potter 7 part 1 was so frickin amazing/insane/beastly/(insert word for awesome ) 
“When I am doing anything else , I think of skating , but when I am skating , I can think of nothing else . ” 
Of all the things I still remember\ 
Summer's never looked the same\ 
The years go by and time just seems to fly\ 
But the memories remain\ 
In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain\ 
Nothing to lose but everything to gain\ 
Reflecting now on how things could've been\ 
It was worth it in the end 
is so lonely :( 
Shibby 
It is official ! Weezer is my most favorite band EVER ! 
today was SOOO much fun !! 
even though it was so unrealistic , the movie Serenity was SOOOOOOO epic 
SNOW DAY !!!!! 
the point of life is to fo what you want , be who you want , and not have to worry about what others thinks of you ! I'm proud of who I am so everybody stop trying to change me !

' Cause everybody wants some love\ 
Shooting from the stars above\
