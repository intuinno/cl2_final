Back home in RAP . Had a good time in SEA , but it's always nice to be home . 

Getting ready for some camping fun in < PROPMALE > . 
Dinner with friends tonight was a lot of fun . 
In fact , his greatest drive to achieve comes from his compulsion to avoid this pain . 
Happy birthday to < PROPMALE > , who is turning 5 today ! 
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes for < PROPMALE > . 
Going to the ZOO 
Preparing for a hiking / camping trip with the boys . 
Just got back from reffing a HS football game in Edgemont . It was a fine night for football . 
Off for All Hallow's < PROPFEMALE > party , then trick or treating on West Blvd . I've got one < PROPMALE > Potter and one < PROPFIRST > themed train conductor . 
Updating a few FB photos . 
Nice family night planned . No school for the boys tomorrow , so it's movie night ! 
attended a rush event for my old college fraternity . All I can say is that times have certainly changed . 
Ran the 5K Turkey Trot with < PROPFIRST > this year . It was his first \long\ " race and he learned to pace himself ( after the first mile ) . " 
< PROPFIRST > , April and the girls spent the night with us last night , after a long day of travel . We fed them and sent them on their way to NE SD to visit family . Can't wait to see them again on the 27th . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone ! 
Drive to inlaws , check . Eat more than thought possible , check . Watching football , check . Next up , nap time ... 
Back to the normal routine today . It's not as much fun as I remember . 
4\ of snow + snow shovel = = workout completed for the day . " 
About to risk going into town . Should be fun . 
I have missed a lot of Big Love in the last two years .... 
Thanks everyone for the Birthday wishes ! 
More snow ??? Where is my spring weather ? 
Off to the model train open house with the boys . 
SNOW ??!! at least it is not sticking ( yet ) 
Well , we got our snow . scattered around a bit , some places with just over an inch , some with little or nothing . 
and now for your weekly RC weather update : 2.25 \ of rain and it's still falling . " 
installed Facebook for Windows Phone 
First day of summer vacation and < PROPFIRST > breaks his left wrist . good times . 
Trying out the new messenger . There's almost too much going on in the UI . 
75 Degrees + WiFi on the front porch + cool beer = = geek heaven !

Nothing like a good rain shower to cause the entire family to run for the camper . We ended up with a couple of extra kids , but I'm sure we'll get it sorted out eventually . 
Day 4 of college reunion . The fraternity banquet was crowded , but I think things went well . Got lots of feedback on the new house presentation . Today , M-Hill climb . My goal is to not have to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > more than 1/2 the way up the hill . 
Day 5 of reunion came to a close with quite a rain storm . Hope all of those that made it to the Harney Peak hike found shelter . 
Drive to Sioux Falls : Check ! \ 
Dinner with sister at Famous Dave's: Check ! \ 
Prepped for interview : Check ! \ 
G'night!

Hanging out at the Hummer dealer in Sioux Falls . The trip across the state with no A/C was a bit trying . However , even with the windows down , the H1 got 11.9 mpg . Not too shabby for a big ol ' tank of a vehicle . 
Week one at < PROPFEMALE > in the bag . I've got a lot to do in the next couple of days .
