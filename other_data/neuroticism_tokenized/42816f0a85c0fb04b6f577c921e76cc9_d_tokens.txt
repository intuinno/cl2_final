Roller derby tonight for the first time in a couple weeks !!! :) 
Just finished watching Camp Rock 2 : The Final Jam with my three youngest siblings .... the movie isn't over , but in my opinion when your brain starts dripping out your ear it's time to leave the room . 
Henry : \Samie you're the best sister ever ..... no offense Emily\ " \

< PROPFEMALE > Fernaays Richardson please call my mom . 
' s stomach is making funny noises ..... time to feed it I suppose 
Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . \ 
My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease \ 
or a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are \ 
looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . Most people won't want to copy \ 
and paste this ....... But do you have the strength to make it your \ 
status for at least one hour ? Promote Love & Acceptance , NOT hate . 
Just got my grade for a reeeaaalllly important annotated bibliography , got a \B\ " !!! * does a happy dance * " 
is a bit of a dork ..... but that's okay :) 
Thanks guys I really had nothing better to do than give you TWO baths because you peed in the first , little trolls . cute little trolls , but trolls nonetheless . 
really does love her little brothers\ 
really does love her little brothers 
Is excited for her first non-working weekend this month , AND < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday party , AND Halloween . So essentially , it'll be awesome !! :D

Me : \Big sisters are around just to ruin all the fun aren't they ? \ " \ 
wishes pop-ups would quit asking me if I was interested in \being naughty on Facebook . \"" 
I have to finish my < PROPMALE > Rule assignment a day early ..... so I can go to Disney tomorrow . Awesome reason ! :D 
Homework related to childhood hunger is depressing . “In 2008 , 16.6 million children lived in food insecure households—the equivalent of one in six American households . ” \ 
one in six ! :( 
funniest trip to Disney ever . 
had fun :) 
is too school for cool

Doing crafts and gift wrapping at pnc bank at the avenue in viera until 130 < PROPFEMALE > and a reigndeer are gonna be here too ! 
With friends like mine I don't see how I can avoid having an amazing birthday , thank you everybody for being amazing and giving me more love than I could ever ask for :) <3 
is getting sick ... >:( 
has brothers who make her laugh even when she's sick <3 
work tomorrow won't be as hectic as I originally believed , but this means I have to work on the 31st :P 
My dog has taken all the Zhu-zhu pets of the house as her puppies and snaps at anyone who tries to touch them . 
It sucks when your friend is too far away for you to hug when you know they need one . 
wow , BCC kind of over-reacted to the rain in my opinion , they my canceled class . It is a nerdy thing to complain about but ... I actually like that class :( 
Oooh look ! I just figured out how to make a camera emoticon ! [* o]\ 
This makes me disproportionately happy ... 
is now addicted to Picnik :D 
Oooh , I got invited to Phi Theta Kappa .... I feel special just because it's the first invitation I've gotten in a while that wasn't over Facebook :P 
Five hundred words into a thousand word paper .... BLEH ! : @

The people in my algebra class are so RUDE ! >:( 
In bed before 1 ? This is possible ?... I like it :) 
I love being warm and clean :) 
To my single friends who get depressed on < PROPFIRST>'s day : You are so amazing and I love you ! <3 Also tomorrow all those heart-shaped chocolates and candies will be 50% off so that is pretty awesome :D

Woke up with squirrels in my room .... they were in a cage but it was still slightly jarring 
If I ever become < PROPMALE > I am going to get reeeeaaaaally fat . 
doesn't want to be doing homework .... :P 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : if you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .... be a good sport and play along .... 4 words is harder than you think . 
So happy right now , its meetings like these that make me love my job ! :) 
yay ! I just remembered that yesterday was Thursday , which means a new episode of my favorite show came out ! 
Well , that was pleasant ... 
Thinks it's hilarious that McDonald's wants people to think that their food is \good for you\ " and \ " made fresh \"..." 
can't concentrate ... curse you internet ! 
My zombie apocalypse team : < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Crider , Kynndarrn Williamson , < PROPFEMALE > Ceccio , < PROPFIRST > Smith , and < PROPFIRST > Cirillo ... yeah I think our odds are about 50/50 . < PROPFIRST > could be our mascot ... 
wow ... Facebook has just informed me that between five of my friends there have been 107 check-ins at Frankies Wings N Things .... and they're all from drum lol 
Bleh .... scarification is interesting but not enough to write a 1,500 word research paper on it .... :P 
Why is it that as I load something the \estimated time remaining\ " starts going up instead of down ?! I think my computer just likes to watch me get frustrated and then chuckle evilly to itself ... " 
and then after 10 minutes of waiting it says \an error occurred while processing your request \"...#$%@$&%!" 
Aparently using little brothers as living pokemon and using them to enact a poke-battle is frowned upon .... 
Earth hour tonight @ 830 pm !
