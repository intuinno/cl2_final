is tired 

feels ignored 
finally have a cell phone 
is listening to dark blue by < PROPFIRST>'s mannequin 
is very bored 
is once again ... bored 
is very happy 
isn't very happy anymore 
is thinking 
wonders who his doppelganger is 
meh 
isn't in a very good mood 
you just can't live in that negative way , make way for the positive day 
i don't care if Monday's black , Tuesday Wednesday heart attack , Thursday never looking back ... 
is really tired for some reason 
the static waves across the screen define this notion back and forth and in between like my emotion and i know youre never gonna understand and wont you slow this down oh if you can you swayed your hips and stole the breathe that i was taking i touched your lips and held your hands when they were shaking 
500 days of summer is a fantastic movie 
This awkward silence makes me crazy The glow inside burns light upon her I'll try to kiss you if you let me Tidal waves they rip right through me Tears from eyes worn cold and sad Pick me up now , I need you so bad 
and i can't wait , till i get home . to pass the time in my room , alone 
I don't want the world to see me , cause i don't think that they'd understand . When everything's made to be broken , i just want you to know who i am . 
went to ride my bike today and it started hailing outside . then later on i decided to try it again , figuring it was done being rainy out , so then after biking for a while getting pretty far away from home , guess what ? it started raining again . so then i made the long journey home only to have it stop raining 5 minutes later .
