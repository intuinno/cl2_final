Feeling conflicted , like I always do when I look at facebook . 
have headache . 
peeeaceful , with just the two us home . =) 
Next door neighbors ' new renters are having a really loud party . * hates * 
Still loving the photos of us from our trip ... 
Spazzy and weird , that is I . And hungry . O_o 
Just ... make it ... stop . 
Hungry ! ....... Been a good few days . =) 
Tummy hurts . 
Tired of stressssssssssss . Ready for it to be over . 
The countdown to Tuesday's 5am worktime begins ... because I said so . 
Tired . Happy to be home to snuggle < PROPFIRST > . xD Happy to have the weekend off . Need the rest . Badly . 
Survived a < PROPMALE > car accident without a seatbelt , on Wednesday . We're mostly okay . I have to buy a new car . 
Still doing okay after the wreck . Looking for a new car . < PROPFIRST > has a minor shoulder injury and I have a moderate-but-immensely-irritating-and-upsetting chest wall injury that causes me a lot of pain from time to time . I still can't work , yet . 
Sometimes I kinda just want to sink into the earth and hibernate for a while . 
The scab finally fell off of my facial laceration ! Woo ! I was happy to see how big it really is . Haha . 
.... The laceration , that is ; not the scab ... 
dammit ; i just ignored a request i didn't mean to . * cries * 
My grandmother's name keeps popping up in the \suggestions\ " section and it's very confusing . My grandmother has a facebook ?? " 
* sigh * =( 
Starvinnnng ... 
it shouldn't be this goddamn hard . 
How the hell do you create a facebook account for a business , anyway ? 
Just created a < PROPFEMALE > for OneTrueTree Creations ! 
Help celebrate EnvDefenseFund's National Day of Climate Action ! Tell your Senators to pass a strong climate bill : http://bit.ly/KzR9A 
Best day in forever . GO SAINTS !!! Go < PROPFIRST > . Go love , go peace and calm , go good days , and go relaxed/jovial quality time ! 
How the fuck does this new facebook format work ? * irritated * All I want to do is make a note ... ;_; 
WHY THE FUCK CAN'T WE GET A GODDAMN BREAK ?? In SOMETHING . ANYTHING ?!? 
Chameleons .... 
SEWIN'! 
Woooooo ! My profile is now blingin ' with a new tab that shows you all my items for sale on Etsy.com! I'm so excited ; I didn't even know you could do that until today . =) 
Okay , so I have to take part in Boobquake , too . I'm doing my part ... ARE YOU !? 
Somebody teach me how to stop procrastinating ? =/ 
Oh , man , I am so looking forward to having a new laptop !! Will alleviate some of this damn nerve pinching I ' m getting from wrestling with the mousepad on my current one . * can hardly wait * 
Hurrah ! I finally got a URL for OneTrueTree's < PROPFEMALE > ! http://www.facebook.com/OneTrueTreeCreations 
Hot day . Decided to spend the majority of today cleaning/organizing . About time ! Allergies are acting up , though . 
Throat is killing me . CLEANING MADE ME SICK ! =P I wanted to clean more , today , but I don't feel up for it . Go figure . =/ 
Seem to have finally gotten over that cold , so today .... MORE CLEANING !! 
=P 
Tired . Tired . ... Tired . 
HAIRCUT !!! I have shortshort hair , now . 
* sigh * 
Maybe I should get a job . 
Bad posture only causes bad things . I've got a cranky pinched nerve , now . Sit up straight , boys and girls ! 
Hair dying in process . O_O 
Blah . Hair dye didn't turn out the way I wanted it to . Not sure if I like it , now . 
My neck is starting to bother me , again . * sigh * All signs point to me needing to get more activity . Ha . 
My hair has faded really badly and I have dark roots ... time to re-bleach and re-dye ! I think I might be getting a cold , though , so it may end up waiting ... 
I'm so tired of hearing about parents enabling destructive behavior in their children and then complaining about it . 
They're pressure-washing a house outside and it's really distracting . Poor < PROPFIRST > ; he's trying to get work done . 
I just realized that I haven't eaten anything all day . 
I think I'm going to use the rest of my purple dye . And then maybe let things gradually go back to my natural color until I visit < PROPFEMALE > next year . 
On hold , waiting to bitch out Google for not allowing me to log into YouTube . All this connecting shit to other shit is retarded . 
Been on hold for 40 minutes , now . Worst customer service EVER . I'm seriously considering boycotting Gmail , now , because of this . 
Phew ! Finished < PROPFIRST>'s order , today , then spent the rest of the day making Christmas cookies and hunting down some chocolates < PROPFIRST > and I have been wanting to try . Cookies are still un-iced , so that'll have to wait until tomorrow because < PROPFIRST>' mother has taken over the kitchen . =( 
Iced the cookies , after all ! Four flavors : vanilla , anise , almond , and lemon ( for < PROPFIRST > ) . I need to hunt down my mom's cookie recipe , though , because while these cookies are good , they don't quite measure up , somehow . Hrrmm . 
Today didn't go as planned ... 
I HATE ALL YOU BASTARDS WHO ARE GETTING SNOW ! D= 
x_x 
Hair dye turned out more blue than purple , and tinted my tips to a weird brassy color . Hrm . 
Hurrrgh . I have that weird \I've eaten too much sugar and not enough real food\ " feeling . " 
I rather dislike federal holidays . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFIRST > Shields 
I need to dye my hair again !! I think today is an errand day . Or tomorrow . Tomorrow at the latest . 
Bought dye ! All the blue/purple has faded out of my hair , so it's just a icky gray-ish brown/blonde , so ... back to trusty old pink ! 
Exhausted . Too much to do , too little energy . 
I think it's weird when friends of my friends send me a friend-request when I've never even talked to them , before . 
Today was basically one big failure . 
Why is everyone crazy ? O_o 
Why has livejournal been the target of so many hack attacks , lately ? Anyone have any info ?
