Okay peoples , I'm sixteen . There's a bit more responsibly that lies in my hands . I can choose what to wear , what to eat , what music i like what clubs to join .... as well as , getting to choose my own friends and other peoples I converse with or don't converse with . let me live my life my way and I won't judge how you live your's 
I'm sixteen not six people so stop acting like I'm incapable of handleing myself . 
Note to self : open door before trying to walk through it . 
I have to be in the weirdest mood ever , a mixture of silly/childish and cynical ..... scary thought 
i scare myself .... i finished a sudoku puzzle in 17 minutes flat ....

How do you expect kids to listen to their parents when Tarzan lives half naked , < PROPFEMALE > comes home at midnight , Pinocchio lies all the time , Alladin is the < PROPMALE > of thieves , Batman drives at 200 mph , Sleeping Beauty is lazy , and Snow White lives with 7 guys . We shouldn't be surprised when kids misbehave , they get it from their story book . Copy this on your wall if you laughed ...! ( : 
I don't know what I think right now ... :/ I think too much 
<----------- Thinks people need to stop trying to understand me , just except what you don't understand and embrace it 
GAHHHH STUPID FACEBOOK CHAT STINKS ..... make it back to the old one ! 
I demand that someone give me a digi-cookie :( 
nap time 
not napping anymore .... 
Instead jokes totally confuse those who weren't there . Nanami Éliane Sakurai knows \Snowball\ " for instance " 
<--- figures people think it's funny to mess with me ... anyone care to put their input on why that might be ? 
How well do you know me ..... \ 
My favorite show that is no longer on the air ? \

There's a group of people in my life who never fail to make me feel better ... I need them right now :( 
I've discovered I'm a brilliant actress .... I can be hurting and no one would even know ........ Well if I didn't I'd seem like a depressed mess haha 
If there's any sudden change in my relationship status in the next few days ... I can only be happy it happened . It was mutual , yes I'll be upset but I'd be hurt more had it stayed the same ... don't try to kill him or anything ... I'm sure both side of this are just as hurt by it . But somethings just are like you plan you know ? 
Time to put acting skills to the test . Make people believe that I'm not about to slap them 
With stress from guys , toddlers , drunks , family and everything in between I'm just stressed out ... mind you none more then every other time , I'll be over it soon I just wish I wouldn't have to be stressed in the first place 
it's funny how I can be falling apart myself but still try to help my friends pick up the pieces from their disasters .... and they wouldn't even know 
I just wanted to let all my friends know how awesome they are !! I WUVS YA !! <3 
Babysitting is like tempoary mommy hood .... mothers I do not envy you . 
I'm a Taurus stubborn by nature , strong-willed , and independent . I love with my whole heart and care about everyone . Those of you who think it's fun or cute to hurt me it's like crushing a < PROPFEMALE > . It may make you feel better about yourself but it destroys honest beauty . 
has been told a lot lately to start taking care of myself and my emotional state not worry about others ..... worrying about others is what i do best hahha . i've been accused of being a pushover a lot because of that 
I've found out that the gummy bears are planning their attack .... counter attack planning time . any one wanna help ? 
I've found I really like Indie Rock music ..... hahahha my friend told me to listen to this band called Rise Against ..... lets just say I have a new favorite to add to the mix hahahah 
I would like to tell everyone I'm making the choice to have a Pescetarian diet , meaning the only animal I will eat is fish . I just wanted to tell people so that they aren't offended when I refuse to eat something they cook and people can be supportive and offer alternate food for me if I'm staying for dinner ect . Thanks guys 
Yes I did wake up on the wrong side of the bed , no telling to calm down doesn't work and yes i wanna punch a few specific people 
hhahahhaha I was talking to an old friend's mom and they told me they dreaded the day I became a teen . and that now that I am I'm not allowed to act teenage-ish .... TOO LATE hahah . I'm a teen , We act like we know everything , everything seems like the end of the world , oh and guess what we make mistakes sometimes . but would you have it any other way ? 
I want some old comic book like deadpool hahahah 
Blasting country , rocking my pink cowgirl and drinking mt . dew ?? I think so XD 
........ I might not be on much the rest off the day just FYI .... 
I am very tired and frustrated ............... 
I want to do something with my life whatever I choose that to be you have no right to judge it it's my choice to make 
Don't test my < PROPFEMALE > it will fail . 
SIBLING WAR !!! Copy this if you are the smartest , best looking and funniest of your siblings . If this stands an hour without your sister or brother protesting , you WIN !! 
Hey guys I almost got in a fight today . I ended up punching the wall instead of that girl though XD i bruised my hand . 
I woke up at 4:30 am to drive to manchester beach california .... dr. pepper plus the toddlers are asleep so I'm okay 
Om nom time 
Okay fine have it your way I'm done playing nice . I'm done with people not respecting me . have fun trying to earn my trust back . It ain't easy , ask those who've lost it . 
<--- Has a dog who loves long walks in the park , cuddling , sleeping with me , greets me with kisses after a long day at school , loves me without restraint , who needs a boyfriend ? 
I was asked the other day what kind of guy I would want to date , ( after turning down a guy who was a jerk ) and I simply gave him the link to a pair of songs , both by Christian Kane , \A Different kind of Knight\ " and \ " All I Did was Love Her\ " and that explains it . " 
If I died today what would your reaction be ? -comment your answer- 
I want people to just stop trying to make me something I'm not . I am what I am if that's not enough then your not worth it . 
Appearently I'm not loved DX 
\If you're worried and you can't sleep\ 
Friends I have a challenge for you , comment with one nickname for me ( no repeats ) and one thing you like about me GO ! 
I hate waking up and not being able to go back to sleep .... 
\You're an < PROPFEMALE > Sciuto kinda crazy XD\ " my friends are awesome " 
I have listened to my people . they seem to think I've been depressed lately .... no i haven't I have depression it's an all the time thing but i have layers and layers of happy sad hurt , glad joyful ..... I have been multitasking a herd of emotions . it's call being a teen with PTSD 
today went from headesk to asking god to help me help my stupid self .... no worries though I'm a trooper as you all know 
So hi y'all i'm on my way home . 
Hey every one update from the road . About to pass grants pass and heading north to home . 
Just passed a sign \portland 101 miles\ " getting closer " 
I'm home . Gunna watch a movie then go to bed . Night lovies !! 
I always wonder why people can't just say what's on their mind .... because hello folks i'm not a mind reader ...... * Is sick of people not getting to the point and speaking their mind . * if you have something to say , say it 
i just got home yesterday and I've already resorted to hiding at my friends house from the crap at home DX just lovely 
Is logging off for the night to try and stop thinking in the circles she's been thinking in for the past few days DX 
Blah . People are just annoying me 
Lemme say this : you don't have to like me but if you don't treat me with at least respect we're gunna have problems 
Saw thor today . And now I'm at a friends watching chicago . 
Random question everyone . What movie character do you think I'm most like ? 
People are just petty idiots sometimes 
My letter from < PROPFEMALE > is T\ 
Something I like : Talking\ 
Something I don't like : Too many people\ 
A girl's name : < PROPFEMALE > XD\ 
A boy's name : Trevor\ 
Like and I'll give you a letter . 
You know .... no one said you have to like me , but you damn well better respect me and treat me like a person or your sure as hell gunna be in for it 
Welll I was going to say something awesome but all my awesome got drained today 
I have a lot of confused thoughts that go through my head 
Let's see how many people remember how we met . Comment below explaining how we met ? 
so appearently I'm a rude bratty selfcentered . Could've fooled me . 
\I don't like minorities . \"" 
I have songs stuck in my head and the voices don't like them XD 
If anyone needs me today I will be getting dragged around the mall by my sister 
Like I won't lie .... \ 
[] I liked u once\ 
[] I think ur cute\ 
[] I think ur really hot\ 
[] I really don't know you ... \ 
... [] we should hangout more :D \ 
[] we should be friends :P \ 
[] I love you ? ( as a friend)\ 
[] I'd date you\ 
[] I'd kiss you\ 
[] we should talk more\ 
[] your my everything ? \ 
[] text me ? \ 
[] stop being a stranger\ 
[] put this as your status so I can like it 
I want a life handbook . Answers to all of life ..... 
You know I'm not of a mall person .... but it sounds better then staying home .... so I guess I'm going to hide in the mall for a while . 
Needs more days like today just hanging out with friends . I missed it . 
I have come to the conclusion that being a teenager sucks . People treat me like a kid and expect me to act like an adult . Then add high school , which in tunr adds drama and panicing to keep grades up . And why not throw in hormones .... whoever came up with teenage years should be shot DX 
Okay . I'm going to make it a point/goal to try to look at the good things .... I've been way to pessimistic lately .... more then lateky but either way 
Today someone on the bus asked me why I seemed so happy . And my honest answer \because I'm sick of being sad and I've desided there's nothing a smile can't fix . \"" 
I just saw the google maps streetview carmera car ..... on the corner of evergreen and main ..... next time they update look and see if I'm there 
om nom nom nom nom nom nom .... 
May I ask a personal favor ..... Only some of you will do it , and I know who you are . If you know someone who fought cancer and won , or fought cancer and died , or someone who is still fighting please add this to your status for an hour as a < PROPFIRST > of respect and in remembrance . I shall remember and respect her courage and fight always . 
-BRAIN NOT FUNTIONING WILL NOW REBOOT- I'll get back to you once I fix this minor set back ..... 
Sometimes I feel totally out of the loop people need to tell me things for me to understand what the heck they are talking about ... you know because \ 
i'm not a flipping mind reader 
Just got a totoro plush backpack XD I love my cousins sometimes . 
I challenge you facebooker I know to comment below with one random fact you know about me . No repeats . 
Watching old cartoons . Haha . 
\I'm not crazy i'm just awesome\ " I love when peopel text me funny stuff it gives me status updates " 
Let's see who reads this fully ... Leave me a one word comment that best describes me , using the THIRD letter of your LAST name , it can only be ONE word & then copy this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Don't just post a word and not copy , that's no fun 
I want everyone to comment the three things you love about me most on thus post , then copy as your status . 
I'm sick of not being good enough for some people .... everytime I think I'm close I just prove farther from what they expect ..... why can't people , parents ( adopted or not ) friends , fellow students ...... stop thinking I'm super woman cuz i'm not 
Wants a batch or two of cyber cookies 
I honesty want school to start now ... I hate summer because it gives my parents more chances to yell at me DX 
I need a hug .... not cuz I'm sad or anything I just want a hug . 
I'm dealing with some drama at the moment so if i take awhile to respond don't flip out on me ' < PROPFEMALE > ? 
I'm going to introduce my head to the wall ... multipul times 
Take that my day just got awesome I has a recipe for banana bread . heck yes XD 
Watching Firefly , avoiding my net stalker and plotting revenge .... today's a good day XD 
Grounded untill farther notice . This will be my last update for a while 
So life's good other then a \minor parental/child disagreement\ " leading to a choice of which grounding was the far better of the too .... I retain my freedom to make my own choices . I will gladly take the grounding . " 
HEy Y'all I'm alive .... somewhat happy and not plotting deaths so yup lifes good . 
So I'm kinda ungrounded but ... I dunno entirely how ungrounded I am . But yeah I'm not dead school was enjoyable life's good LOVE AND PEACE \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Jamming out to random music and drinking mt . Dew thanks to my buddies out from albertson's today with our mini party moment hahahah life's a crazy ride but tini moments like that make it worth it 
I woke up this morning thinking to myself \well self ... ( cuz I do that sometimes . ) You're pretty darn well off and aren't depressed as you were so today keep up the happy thoughts \"" 
I have things I am going to post then I deside not to for some reason . Then I have nothing to say and people ask me to say stuff .... odd . 
I have weird luck ... hahah odd things always happen to me .... like the mime thing . 
You have the right to remain sleepy anything posted on facebook can and will be used againgst you in a social setting . You have the right to log off and turn off the computer facebook isn't going to disappear . \ 
G'Night fellow facebookers 
Morning facebookers . Hope everyone has a nice day 
I'm actually having a good day all events concidered 
I'm proud of myself . We did the pacer in hip hop aerobics . In middle school ( the last time I did the pacer ) I only ever got to 11 and the healthy number for a 16 year old girl is 32 I got to 40 today XD 
G'night facebook ... I'm sleepy .

Well I'm off to the beach for the day . For no real reason ..... Yay ! * rolls eyes * family outting DX 
Watching < PROPFIRST > spielberg's young sherlock holmes then later watching downing jr. ' s sherlock holmes 
Fact is those of you who act like you know everything about me truely know very little about me . 
< PROPFIRST > Izzard is awesome my sister put two of his shows on my computer 
Braclet making time .... maybe .... homework first 
Okay the next person who asks about my lack of homecoming date will suffer the flying monkeys ... 
It's sad .... i say not to do something and there's always the one troll who always does what i said not to do . 
without my past i wouldn't be who i am today . As imperfect as i am i'm perfectly happy with who i am . 
I did bad on my theater audition ..... :( at least I think so haha 
' Morning facebook . I hope eveyone has a good day . 
School's over for thed week and I have nothing to do this weekend aside from chores

\Blackbird singing in the dead of night\ 
Finished cleaning really quickly for some reason ..... Time to watch Firefly online XD .... Oh and again I swear by my pretty floral bonnet to the next person who bothers me about home coming I will end you ! 
Someone questioned my saying I'm straight ... well in a way I suppose I'm not . I thought about it and well i'm more interested in personality then gender ... but I find male personalities more challenging to understand so in that I am straight i guess .... does that make any sense ? 
Tomorrow is National Kiss Day . Put this as your status . If somebody inboxes you a \?\" they wanna kiss you .. (: " 
OK Just because I'm curious everyone write something that they like about\ 
me :) 
The girl you just called fat ? She's overdosing on diet pills . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . See that man with the ugly scars ? He fought for his country . That guy you just made fun of for crying ? His mother is dying . Put this as your status if you're against bullying . I bet 95 % of you wont re-post , but my true friends will . People really should take this to heart .. 
My age is 10\ 
I wanted to be anyone else\ 
I was in a relationship with my < PROPMALE > bear\ 
I was afraid in general\ 
I lived in vancouver washington\ 
Like for an age 
\Was I out of line ? \ 
So . I'm most likely not going to homecoming . Because we don't have a lot of money and I don't really wanna go so I'm most likely going to use the money to buy a theater shirt 
I'm for sure not going to homecoming . No real reason to go ... I've been to the dances so it's nothing new or interesting just looking stupid failing at dancing and standing around looking stupid every time a slow song comes around ...

Dolphin voice wins ! 
I was talking to a good adult friend of mine today about my plans after high school and I'm not sure yet and that's okay . but I have options and that's great for me . I have a basic idea what i want 
Truth is_____ . Like and I'll finish the sentence about you . 
\What's on your mind\ " huh ..... too much to type it all out " 
Sorry if I'm online and I don't respond I'm handling a lot of things at a time one of which requires me to stay logged in . you can message me I may not reply and if i do it'll take a while . 
* sigh * Texas is looking better and better ... In a lot of ways ...... 
I am not scared of spiders . Which makes my next few sentences strange .... I always thought skeeter eaters looked like flying spiders , and they do the same thing ( kill unwanted bugs ) .... this last part is mind boggling ... I'm terrified of the darn things DX . 
Life is awesome for now . crashing at Nanami Éliane Sakurai's house .... free food tomorrow XD 
* computer reboots * \ 
Nanami Éliane Sakurai : D: \ 
Me : \When you're evil\ " is too sexy for your computer . \ 
At a neighborhood potluck with my friend . 
<--- is being evil today ..... you have been forewarned . 
I forgot how much i liked Bowling for soup XD ..... found some stuff on youtube and started jamming . XD 
I dislike the feeling I get when people say nice things about me .... I feel like I don't have the qualities they see ... that I don't deserve they're admiration or believe in me ..... 
How is that when I want someone to talk to ( Now ) people don't talk to me , but when I want to be left alone 17 people demand my attention ( 50% of my life ) XD 
Morin ' Facebookers ! Happy Monday ! 
.... loud music+crowd+lunch = unhappy < PROPFEMALE > .... 
<--- is looking for something to do after school tomorrow since it's an early release . Any bidders ? 
Yes I love my combat boots/converse ( either/or ) , I play video games , I jam to almost all music , I use phrases no one uses anymore and I dance in the rain and am learning to smile and honestly be happy again . WHAT OF IT !!!! 
When I become angry with you and I am getting in your face it's because I still care . When I become silent , calm and distant , is when you should start to worry 
Hey here's a challenge for y'all , comment with two words that describe me . Try not to have repeats . 
So homecoming is an option now .... well again . I kinda wanna go now anyways .... I wanna see < PROPFIRST > Lyons and < PROPMALE > in semi-formal and tease them for kicks XD 
So I made a google+ but I'm still going to use Facebook . but since people I know use google+ I wanted to make one too 
I'm ugly , LIKE if you disagree Repost if you've ever been called ugly ( keep in mind I don't think I'm ugly i just don't think i'm pretty either ... I'm average ) 
Understanding shakespeare is really really hard 
I just went to < PROPFIRST>'s and saw at least seven people I know .... It was really weird . I saw two people I know then walked back to where my dad was and was talking to him about how when I got to the store with him I see people I know but if i go with anyone else or alone I see no one . It got weirder just as i finished saying that I turn around and I saw my friend's sister and was like holy crap another person I know . Then I saw a few people on the way out from some of my classes ..... Moment of coincidence to extremes 
Out to sushi tonight ! Heck yes ! 
I'm making a list of good songs so if y'all could comment with some good songs and their artists I'll give each of you that do 10 kudos . ( ask if you don't know about kudos from me ) 
I may dress and live like a city girl but truth is I grew up a country girl on the inside and I always will be 
For all who Know Motorcycle Riders , or are riders ...... I saw you hug your purse closer to you in the grocery store line . But you didn't see me put an extra $10.00 in the collection plate last Sunday . I saw you pull your child closer when we passed each other on the sidewalk . But you didn't see me playing < PROPFEMALE > at the local mall . I saw you change your mind about going into the restaurant . But you didn't see me , attending a meeting to raise more money for the hurricane relief . I saw you roll up your window and shake your head when I drove by . But you didn't see me , driving behind you when you flicked your cigarette butt out the car window . I saw you frown at me when I smiled at your children . But you didn't see me when I took time off from work to run toys to the homeless . I saw you stare at my long hair . But you didn't see me and my friends cut ten inches off for Locks of Love . I saw you roll your eyes at our leather coats and gloves . But you didn't see me and my brothers donate our old coats and gloves to those that had none . I saw you look in fright at my tattoos . But you didn't see me cry as my children where born and have their name written over and in my heart . I saw you change < PROPFIRST > s while rushing off to go somewhere . But you didn't see me going home to be with my family . I saw you complain about how loud and noisy our bikes can be . But you didn't see me when you were changing the CD and drifted into my < PROPFIRST > . I saw you yelling at your kids in the car . But you didn't see me < PROPFIRST > my child's hands , knowing he was safe behind me . I saw you reading the map as you drove down the road . But you didn't see me squeeze my wife's leg when she told me to take the next turn . I saw you race down the road in the rain . But you didn't see me get soaked to the skin so my son could have the car to go on his date . I saw you run the yellow light just to save a few minutes of time . But , you didn't see me trying to turn right . I saw you cut me off because you needed to be in the < PROPFIRST > I was in . But you didn't see me leave the road . I saw you waiting im < PROPFIRST > iently for my friends to pass . But you didn't see me . I wasn't there . I saw you go home to your family . But you didn't see me . Because I died that day you cut me off . I was just a biker . A person with friends and a family . But , you didn't see me . Repost this around in hopes that people will understand the biker community . If you don't repost this , It sucks to be you . I hope you NEVER lose someone that rides . 
Migraine from hell is back DX 
It's sad when my youngest sister whom I hardly ever get along with becomes my favorite in the house .... lol 
Well I'm for sure going to homecoming , No date unless someone actually asks me .... 
Press \like\ " if you are glad to have met me . Post this and see how many of your friends are glad to have met you ! :D " 
Who's more foolish , the fool or the fool who follows him . -Obi-Wan Kenobi ( < PROPFEMALE > wars episode 4 a new hope . ) 
My heart is like an open book : it depends on how you read me . Don't judge me by my cover . Take time to read into who I really am not what you first see .... 
is there anyone going to heritage's homecoming that would be able to have me spend the night afterwards so my parents don't have to stay up late ? 
I just realized ... if I'm texting someone and I make a very noticeable typo I will send a second correcting said typo ... 
Jealous ! Of what exactly ? Your total lack of class , your small mindedness and ignorance or the fact you have all the looks and personality of a boiled potato !!

Don't judge me or bully me If you had to walk a mile in my shoes , see my world , and what i do to keep my life together by a thread you'd probably need therapy . 
To everyone who gave blood today y'all are awesome . I mean seriously donations like the ones gave today saved my life march freshman year ... I'm glad to have made it through that ... it was scary and without that donated blood i very likely would have died ....

I hate it when people expect me to be a mind reader .... people need to tell me what they are thinking if they want/ expect me to know . 
Well so much for making up my mind ... back to the fence .... 
Bleh . I had a weird dream again .... weird . 
If I can't make up my mind how can I tell people what's on it ? 
I keep having weird dreams .... subconscious stop beating around the bush and get to the point . or at least make it clearer 
How do you explain how you feel when you don't even know why you feel like you do ? 
Well g'night FB . Hoepfully I'll get some sleep with my weird dreams I've been having 
I just cut my index finger doing the dishes because no one told em that the lid to our round casserole dish was chip and sharp .... 
Be nice ... You might just be the best part of someones bad day ! 
The Best index to a person's character is ( A ) how he treats people who can't do him ant good , and ( B ) how he treats people who can't fight back` < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Buren 
People should know by now that if they have something they want/need to say to me they should just say it . If your honest with me and were honest the whole time I won't be bothered . Not only that but I'm not easily bothered by things so just say what your going to say . I'm getting sick of the bush beating people are trying to do when dealing with me .
