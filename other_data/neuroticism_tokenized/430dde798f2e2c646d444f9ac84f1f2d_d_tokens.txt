Well its my bedtime night night children 
So in order to get everything I need to record my drums ( including new laptop and about 7 or 8 mics ) I need about 1,000 YAY :( 
\I've decided\ 
I discovered that Apple is fond of the fact that I may need to get and spend $2000 for recording equipment and a cheap ( as in $900 ) MacBook . Off to search the interwebs for used stuff ! 
Recording shit needed 2 Electro-Voice mics ($200 ) 3 Audio Techica Handheld Side Address studio consenser mic ( 450 ) 1 Shure Dynamic Cardioid Mic ($100 ) Steinberg Cubase Essential 5 Software ($150 ) Tascam 16 channel USB 2.0 audio ($470 ) speakers for $150 and a laptop soooo donations ?
