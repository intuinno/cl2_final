Why is it that craddling a little baby and feeding him/her a bottle of milk until he/she falls asleep always makes me nearly fall asleep to the piont where I'm fighting to keep my eyes open ? Just finished putting the brothers to bed a little while ago . Zzzzzzz 
The warm breeze of spring brings a carefree smile . Carefree enough to want to lay outside and find figures in the clouds , or count all the stars in the night . 
already time for the Book & Bed combo . Night night all 
Good Morning ! time to get ready for gaurd and such . hope all of you have a good day ^.^

you know , its really frustrated not being able to sleep well , too much on the mind , but its nice to hear Dad waking me up in the morning saying come eat breakfast , the smell of blueberry pancakes and the surround sound playing some fun easy going music 
Zzzzzzzzz , why is it that everyone I've talked to only has one maby two graduation practices if any and we have a total of five and a step up day that we're required to attend ? Its as if they fear we don't know how to walk , sit , and reckognize our own name when its called . 1-3 practices I can easily understand , but five , and in a way six with the whole step up day stuff . 
I have a car now ?!

From a little Netbook to a big Compaq laptop 
Gotta love running around in the rain 
Little sister fell asleep on the couch waiting for a movie to rewind ..... How adorable , I've nearly forgotten my frustration with her .

I miss the sunlight , hurry up spring !!

Climb over one mountain , only to see another before you , and when you reach the top of the highest mountain in your path , you'll realise that is all your path is . Mountians
