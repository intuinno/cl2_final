Resting at home with a lower back strain . No worries ; I'm fine really ! Much love to < PROPFEMALE > & DJ at CCL for taking care of me ... 
I had an awesome time at < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST>'s last night . Time spent with friends is time well spent . Of course , cigars were involved . I smoked a Montecristo #2 and a Tatuaje Cojonu 2009 . 
Accomplished ! Taxes , monthly bills , and business taken care of . 
Now I know I'm alive !
