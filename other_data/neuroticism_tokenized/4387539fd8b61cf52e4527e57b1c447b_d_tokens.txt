One of every 10 people is born gay . That means they will be instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in minority and so much else , for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are trying suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them that life will get better and ... that you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% of you who will .
