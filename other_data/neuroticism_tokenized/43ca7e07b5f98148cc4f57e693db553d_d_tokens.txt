WHAT THE FUCK 
I need to go out somewhere . I can't stay home . Gulf Gate anyone ? 
Hello insomnia , old friend , it's been a while . How have you been ? 
I think I've slept about 4 hours in the last two days . Ugh turkey day . 
What to know the best way to get your waiter to hate you ? Ask for hot tea . For some reason , an industry that’s managed to streamline everything else hasn’t been able to streamline that . You've got to get a pot , boil the water , get the lemons , bring a cup and spoon . It’s a lot of work for little reward . 
We still haven't decided what we are doing New Years < PROPFEMALE > . What's up ? 
I just ordered the Nexus One ! Free overnight shipping ! 
Starting to pack . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I signed up for Youfit , 10 bucks a month is much better than the 50 I pay at LifeStyles . < PROPFEMALE > almost didn't do because of the sales girl though . 
Got my tax money ! I'll back on the motorcycle by wednesday . 
thinks doppelganger week is stupid . 
Vinsanity !! 
Work is going to be so much fun tonight . 
Why don't we get you a puppy so you can break up with me a week later ? I like that plan . 
Got my DL back , got the motorcycle running , taking it in tomorrow morning to get tuned up . One problem - the gas cap won't unlock , and it's on empty . The fun never stops ... 
Took some cold meds and had a productive sick day . Got some of my photos printed and sent them off to the photo contest from work , got a hair cut , told the hair stylist \that what she said\ " when she said she didn't want to get me wet . Canceled my $60 a month gym membership now I'm gonna try and return a bicycle I've been borrowing next . It's nice being back on the motorcycle . = 0 " 
Entourage , season two . Then out somewhere tonight . 
Ugh , fever . 
At some point the world shits on everybody . 
You can never find yourself until you face the truth . So I know the truth about her , faced it , it wasn't pretty . She is not who I thought she was . More like my ex than I ever thought was possible . How did I get two girls in a row to do me so dirty ? 
So 3 hours of basketball and I'm exhausted boy . 
Just did 137 on the interstate . Forgot what that felt like . Stupid yes , but still fun . No worries in the world when know if you make one wrong move you're done . =) 
I never knew I had such good friends . 
Grilled some filet < PROPFEMALE > and watching the magic v heat . 
Gonna hit the key with cuz then gecks later with the og's . Gotta keep busy . 
To see it with my own eyes ... 
Is truly happy and thankful . I had a great night , one of the best in my life , and all it took was a few great friends , some great jokes , stories and some clarity . 
I'm really getting sick of this cold weather . When it's 40 out what exactly is the wind chill at 50mph on the bike ? 
Awesome . 
Me , the blonde , the brunette and the key = awesome . Sunday funday ! 
Tired of spinning my wheels . More than 3 weeks of going out and drinking to much every night and dwelling on this has come to end . I'm tired of letting what happened rule my life . Instead of saying I'm moving on I'm actually going to do it . 
BASKETBALL ! 
Still can't wrap my head around how < PROPFEMALE > could stay with me on the 11th , break up with me on the phone on the 13th , stay the night at his house on the 14th and go over to my old room and place to see him on the daily ... mind blown . Last person I ever thought could do something like that . 
Has a terrible head and neck ache . 
So I slept most of the day ... 
Upload rampage . 
So I got hit the face playing basketball and knocked out one of my contacts ... it was my last pair . Anyone have a set near - 3.25 with 8.40 bc 14.00 < PROPFEMALE > while I wait for mine in the mail ? =) Be a lifesaver so I don't have to where my glasses or one contact . 
So my brother < PROPFIRST > had a baby girl this morning . = 0 
Just did a two mile midnight run . 
Basketball , then work at 5 where I'll make no money , damn you county fair . 
Ugh ... rolled my ankle . Now I gotta work . 
2 hours of basketball and now I'm on my way to hot yoga with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . =)

Can't wait to get to the gym and play basketball tomorrow to work out all this stress . Nothing like being physically exhausted to make you forget all your problems . 
Off to gulfgate for Fiorellas going away .

Was just reminded how amazing Radiohead is ... 
Asked for and got lunch off , now out to the beach . First time since last year . 
Some people can't relate and others have a lot to learn . 
Doing something tonight , where ever I end up it should be fun . 
Gym , beach ... movie night ? 
I love my days off now that I'm single . Woke up at 9 , went to the gym , then the beach with the crew , then basketball and now I'm off to movie night ... It's nice not having someone clinging on to you at every move . 
Awesome night ! 
Watching Up In The Air 
Ugh my whole body so sore 
Aside from some douchebag , tonight was a great way to start off my bday . Reggae night is amazing ! 
Since I have to wake up at 8 tomorrow , I'm keeping it simple tonight for my bday . Thirsty Turtle starting 10ish , maybe earlier . 
Last night was awesome , thanks to everyone that came out . Somehow after what had to be close to 20 birthday shots and only sleeping a few hours , I don't have a hangover . Now ... off to the gym
