I feel awful in every way right now =( 

\I didn't know they gave out rings at the holocaust . \"" 
I don't think I will ever get tired of this movie , lol 
I love my friends ! Thanks for making me feel better ! =) now if only my cold would quit coming back ... 
I feel much better ; I love shopping . =) 
I am so scared ! The Poetry Slam is in 3 and a half hours ! I also have to miss my sissy's 8th grade graduation . =( I was so close to blowing it off and watching KayKay graduate but I can't . My heart is with her right now . CONGRATZ KAYKAY !!! 
What is the point of all the smilies ? No one can actually make those faces and besides , who really winks or sticks there tongue out that much ? That's right , no one ! 
I have tried to post three things and nothing will post =( I give up ... watch this post 
Everytime I write in this little box i think of writing on my wall in sharpie ... oh well ... 
Trapped in my room because my mom refuses to let me leave , maybe cleaning the bathroom and bribing her will work ... it is worth a shot ... 
according to an ad I can adopt a panda . which sounds lovely until I actually realize what care is involved and that there is no way my mom will go for the idea 
just spent a few hours at the park with my bf and later my sis and < PROPMALE > came . It was wonderfull . I love the park =) 
supposed to be going to get my hair cut later but i don't know if I am going now . < PROPFEMALE > is though , she wants blue bangs and highlights ... that will be just lovely , lol ... can not wait to see how it turns out =) 
Getting my hair washed at the salon is my favorite part of the hair cut . Especially because she massages my head when she washes my hair . It is the best . =) 
waiting ever so impatiently for my sister to return so I may see how her hair turns out 
blue is just odd in her hair , lol 
Doing late night packing for my trip to San < PROPFIRST > on tuesday =) three days in the city ! I can not wait ! 
A full day of packing and to top it off I have to get my allergy shot today , in other words , i shall be very busy 
Car ride = bad internet connection , will be in san < PROPFIRST > soon though =) we are going to the japanese tea gardens =) 
been walking all day , we went to the japanese tea gardens then the botanical gardens and then pier 39 and finally to ghirardelli sqare for ice-cream and chocolate before heading back to the hotel . my feet are hurting and the wind froze me but it was a lot of fun 
Just walked all through < PROPFEMALE > town , to the pier and back to the < PROPMALE > , very < PROPFEMALE > . I am freezing and my feet hurt . It was nice though . I love shopping =) went to the mall yesterday , five floors of nordstroms , it was awesome . then went out to h&m , < PROPFEMALE>'s and finally forever 21 , three floors of bliss . I love that store ! on my way home now though 
I got to spend time with my bestie =) I miss seeing her all the time so it was lovely just talking and hanging out 
I am so tired of trying to keep everyone happy and patch up all my relationships , it is time for everyone else to start working too or just get out of my life . I am not gonna try to keep people in my life if they will not try to stay there . I am done dealing with that shit . 
Going to Red Lobster later for my mom's bday . I don't eat seafood though so ... and my mom has decided to be cranky . this will be interesting . 
Very long day ! I actually tried the seafood at red lobster . I got salmon and tried some of the < PROPFIRST > and crab . It was not that bad . I then went to my grandparents and we had boston cream pie . It was delish . After a trip to kmart I watched an < PROPFEMALE > Cooper dvd with my mom and then went on a walk and finally went to the school and jsut chilled . all in all it was a chill day . 
I am still so tired . I walked around downtown all yesterday , < PROPFEMALE > got her lip pierced and then we saw a movie , after that my grandma and i took my uncle to SF and walked down pier 39 . i didnt get home till almost ten . it was so hot !!! and SF was so cold !!! 
to top everything off i had an awful dream last night so i did not sleep well 
I bought new gum yesterday because I thought I was out . I just found a brand new pack of 5 gum . So now I have two new brand new packs of gum . :/ 
Only fifteen minutes of < PROPFIRST > Day left !! :'( I will now be going back to reading an old post to end the day 
Watched Eclipse earlier today . It was okay . The shirtless < PROPFIRST > helped . so did the fight scenes . minus the fact that the ripping of vamps sounded like nails on a chalkboard . that was annoying . I am also undecided whether i like or dislike the fact that < PROPMALE > has an accent . 
I got to spend time with < PROPMALE > today and yesterday =) 
The inability to fall asleep is awful =( it does provide time to get things done though =\\ 
Had a lovely fourth of july with my lil sis and grandparents . we did not do mmuch but it was really chill . we walked down and saw the fireworks and i spent the night at their apartment . I feel very refreshed =) 
I'm really hating alone time right now 
I used to spend a lot of time regretting an old friendship . I now realize the relationship wasn't healthy & ending it opened my heart up . I no longer look back on the past wishing to change it & being upset . I thank it for bringing me to where I am , a place of love & joy , where I can be happy with who I am & what I have . Thank u for not caring , thank u for pushing me away , thank u for sending me to a brighter future . 
Just watched a marathon of shows with my mom . interesting to say the least . I don't think I want to spend that much time with my mom when she can talk ever again . The shows were good , the talking gave me a headache . then there was an hour of news . Advil is awesome . 
I am officially out of internet time this month =( 
I usually hate mondays but today is nice . My mom went to costco . I got potatoe straws , which sound wierd but are delicious . 
\Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now . \"" 
I got my internet renewed !! =) 
Started cleaning my room today . the cleaning is not hard . motivating myself to actually clean was the chore . my goal : clean and decorated room by the end of the month =) i'm gonna need a lot of luck 
watching shows on youtube from when I was little . =) aww , the memories . rugrats , anyone ? 
just found out that i get to go on my first back to school shopping trip tomorrow ! a month early but oh well , i get new stuff , lol =) 
Went back to school clothes shopping today ! I , obviously , got new clothes =) 
Spent the last couple of days at my grandparents =) We went to healdsburg and windsor to shop today . ended in powell's sweete shop , i got raspberry sorbet , < PROPFEMALE > sticks and one of those chocolate oranges but it was raspberry flavored because i am allergic to oranges . it was nice =) 
I am completely and utterly happy =) it is wonderful 
Had a nice day =) i missed < PROPMALE > so it was great being with him <3 now if only i can convince my mom to let me out of the house again ... 
The mixed signals are really pissing me off ! take a stand for what you want ! don't say one thing and do another , change your mind every other day , leave cryptic messages and then porposefully avoid eye contact as you look guilty . make up your mind and be honest with me so everything can move forward properly ! 
snapple raspberry tea is the bestest <3 
i was just falling asleep so i would feel better when a series of screams disturbs my peace . a group of boys are playing right outside my house and my window is open . i now have an even worse headache . i never knew anything so small could make so much noise . 
bored to death ! the street is being repaved so i have no ride and it smells . this sucks 
officially out of internet until august fourteenth =( 
getting ready to go to the fair =) 
about five hours of walking at the fair , my feet are still killing me and i have a mini migraine but i had fun so it was worth it 
I have been trying but I just can not get to sleep ! 
a nice and fun , but long day at the fair for < PROPFEMALE>'s bday . HAPPY BDAY MY SISTER !! 
just had a small fight with my mom . we are on awful terms right now it sucks . she did give me a birthday present early though , after i acused her of not caring . she gave me this hella pretty ring from dennis(my father ) . apparently his dad gave it to his mom and then he gave it to my mom on there 1st christmas . < PROPFEMALE > they split she kept with the promise to pass it on to me when i turned either 16 or 18 so now I have it . 
lovely day at the fair with my family . i < PROPMALE > out in the grandstands and watched the races , got a ring as a belated bday gift for < PROPFEMALE > , got a necklace and then went on rides with my sis and uncle . it was nice . pottery studio tomorrow and then dinner on saturday for my birthday =) 
I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time - Her Name is < PROPFEMALE > by Shinedown , i can't get this song out of my head 
Had a lovely day . went to the pottery studio and painted a round box with a flower on it then went to the fair and < PROPMALE > out with < PROPMALE > and his family . it was fun . i got a yin < PROPFEMALE > sun henna tatoo =) 
i had a lovely bday ! my mom was in a good mood so no fighting =) 
finally done with all the needed shopping for school , it only took a month and several shopping trips to remember and get everything i need , lol 
walked up to McDonalds from my house and then back home , it was yummy but my feet hurt now :/ 
unexpected trip to the movies with my family and then I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . we spent hours chilling(literally , it was cold out ) in front of their house drawing with chalk , goofing around and taking pictures . I have about 150 pictures and so does < PROPFEMALE > , lol . good times . they remind of when we used to < PROPFEMALE > out all the time . I miss that . It was fun tonight . =) 
just goofing around on cleverbot with some friends , we are so wierd , lol , i love them 
It is hard to believe that this time tomorrow I will be asleep so that I can wake up for school . The summer went by way too fast ! 
My schedule is still screwed up and now I will end up in ap history over a week late . that will not be fun to play catch up in . 
Had a lovely day away from home =) 
Just started my essay . Procrastination is lovely . I have it mapped out and random sentences and ideas , just need to put it together and type . =) 
A stressful day yesterday . it ended nicely though . =) 
After reading a story online in large print everything looks so < PROPFEMALE > , especially texting and the letters in Grapes of Wrath 
Got my classes changed , FINALLY !! 
If your my friend you better act like it . If your not then get out of my life . I am tired of dealing with you acting like you want me around and then when I am there you have nothing to say . If you have something to say about me then say it to me . I am moving on and suggest you do the same . 
Going over to my grandparents in a couple hours to spend the night . =) I love them !! 
Back home from my grandparents . i got my hair straightened(i <3 my grandma ) =) I shall now put on my new monkey pj bottoms , a gray tank and just chill , lol 
\It's obvious that my heart beats for you \"" 
Finally got my new internet service to work ! it only took me five hours ! It was worth it though , $20 for unlimited service =) 
I love weekends ! if only they didn't come with homework ... 
I am tired and just can not get to sleep . I am using Grapes of Wrath to put me to sleep . =) Not that it is boring and I dislike it , Steinbeck just has a tendency to write a lot of extra stuff into his stories . 
Not in the best of moods right now . 
actually looking forward to tomorrow =) i love my familia right now 
in a wonderful mood =) this weekend is going to be fun with my family dinner on sunday , i love when we get along , today was nice =) 
walked my grandparents through back to school night , it was nice , i love my grandparents =) 
I was in a great mood today , then i had to talk with my mom about weekend plans , no better way to kill my joy 
I had a fun day =) 
Before anything worse happens with my mother , i designate this weekend as a good one =) 
I got my homecoming dress today =) 
Somehow i-tunes knows just what to play right now , lol =) 
I hate being stuck in the middle of arguments 
I think I need to stop putting off homework untill the last minute ... 
Went shoe shopping today , ended up with jeans instead 
had so much fun chilling at the harvest fair with < PROPFEMALE > , it was epic , although i dont think i will be inviting her on the ferris wheel again 
Not sure whether to wear my monkey jammies or my black jammies with the silver hearts ... 
Homemade my PHS pride shirt =) i feel so accomplished , lol 
excited for homecoming ! =) 
Had a pretty decent day =) i wish all the best for my friends who had a not so fantabulous day and i hope things get better for them 
\but I think you're a pretty sweet pill that i'm swallowing down\ " =) this song is stuck in my head ... " 
7 inches :(

Live for the moments you cannot put into words <3 
You laugh because I am different , I laugh because you are all the same =) 
who are you to judge me and what i do with my life ? you walked out of my life and pushed me out of your life . if you have something to say then come and talk to me , i am tired of hearing about you talking about me through everyone else ! \ 
\ 
well , it felt good to get that out =) 
and to all the people who stay in my life and support me : thank you , i love you all very much =) \ 
and to my bf who puts up with all my crazy : thanks , i love you so much and am so blessed to have such a sweet and supportive person in my life , you make me smile =) 
Just went through all the ornaments and put mine on the tree , i love looking at the ornaments , so many memories =) 
I do not have an official advent calender this year so if anyone would like to give me a piece of < PROPFEMALE > or stickers or some small gift everyday , I will gladly accept , I can pay in hugs if need be =) 
Getting ready to go out to look at lights with some family friends =)

Thank you so much for harshing my mellow . I'm just gonna go to bed now . Night everyone . 
What kind of sick bastard creates a PEZ dispenser that does not fit the whole roll of PEZ candies ? 
\Light travels faster than sound . This is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak . \"" 
< PROPMALE > Sparks movies(and books ) are so deceptive , they trick you into thinking it is a romance and next thing you know you are witnessing a tragedy

3 ) What I like about you :\ 
4 ) Favorite memory with you :\ 
5 ) Dare you to put this as your status 
I apparently have a bunch of requests ... * ignore , ignore , ignore ... * 
Ignoring something/someone will not make it go away . I had to < PROPFEMALE > this the hard way . 
\I'd never want to see you unhappy\ 
I have an early dentist appointment tomorrow so I must go to sleep . Good night . 
I happen to be in a wonderful mood today =) 
I don't know how much more I can take from my family . I'm starting to get tired of not mattering . It seems like I'm the only one who puts family before friends and interests . God forbid I want to talk to them and spend time with them because a text or tv show is way more important . How dare I have feelings because I \have no idea what are going through\ " . The text and tv will still be there later but I may not be . " 
really weird weekend , back and forth between good and bad . I hope tomorrow will make more sense . 
forgot to turn off my alarm clock so I was up at five . how smart of me . I wanted to sleep in . Oh well , I should probably try to do something productive now . 
It feels like my life is coming apart one piece at a time . I don't know how I am supposed to deal with this . Maybe I just won't deal with it at all . 
I hate holidays . 
\We pasted all our hopes on him\ 
Watching < PROPMALE > and Juliet(the < PROPFIRST > one ) . I think I would like the movie more if the dialogue was modernized , they ditched the hawaiin shirts and they cut back on some of the theatrics 
I finally got around to watching 5 Centimeters per Second . To be honest , I did not really like . It is a great artistic piece but not character . I was not drawn in . 
going to the school today to help out with drama/play stuff 
Moved out all the flats and made three shelfs today ... I feel succesful , lol =) 
Listening to music on Pandora and writing is pretty relaxing since I can't fall asleep 
Why can't people be honest about how they feel ? Why must they hide it and only give half-truths ? just be honest , it makes everyones life easier 
7338 : My love !!! You are a joy to talk to and a beautiful person . I wish I got to talk to you more . 
You can act like I don't exist but that won't make it true 
\I know I've been mistaken\ 
I wanted to throw something at my computer when I found out that Baz Luhrmann(the guy who directed the < PROPFIRST > version of < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ) will be directing a modernized 3D version of The Great Gatsby that will < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
I feel betrayed . I hate when people act one way when I am around but different once I am gone . 
People can be so rude and hurtful without trying to be 
watching Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost . I love Scooby Doo 
finally finished reading A Game of Thrones . now onto the second book , A Clash of Kings . I hope it is as good as the first book 
My friend has just informed me that it is < PROPFIRST > Biebers B-day tomorrow . We have split the cost of a doorknob so that he may finally step out of the closet . 
It seems that Kája < PROPFEMALE > Pavlí ? ek has initiated a poke war . Consider it formally accepted . ;) 
Thank you for helping me sort things out . ( you know who you are ^_^ ) 
I can handle people being rude to me but when someone is rude to my sister that upsets me . I love you , < PROPFEMALE > Rage , and you know I am always here for you . 
I had such a busy day . I just got home from watching my bestie/sister , Alondra Taber Gutting , rock Shakespeare =) 
I really just need a hug right now =/ 
I went to POCS today with < PROPFEMALE > Rage and visited with the lovely < PROPFEMALE > Pither =) 
Cookies + Griffin and Phoenix + The Strokes = a nice and relaxing night <3 
Had an amazing sleepover last night with Alondra Taber Gutting and today I went to Calistoga with my grandparents and sister . I got a dream catcher . <3 
so much fun playing on the wii with my papa =) \ 
then the day went downhill after that 
I love my sisters , < PROPFEMALE > Rage & Alondra Taber Gutting & Kája < PROPFEMALE > Pavlí ? ek !!! We need to talk and < PROPFEMALE > out more ! 
I am so happy . I get to go ice-skating with < PROPMALE > Allen . \ 
and my sisters , < PROPFEMALE > Rage and Kája < PROPFEMALE > Pavlí ? ek are coming too ! ^_^ 
I actually had a lovely day ^_^ 
I am resisting the urge to throw something at the baseball game score that is on my computer screen
