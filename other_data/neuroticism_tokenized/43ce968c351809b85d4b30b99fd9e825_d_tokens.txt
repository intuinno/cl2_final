You can wear your feelings pretty close to the surface today and might even be overly expressive if you have been withholding your anger . But others won't likely let you run on with your emotions unrestrained and their response can upset you even more . Keep in mind that your perceptions may be warped by hurtful memories and the present moment may not be quite as intense as it seems . 
Oh god ... =.= the miracle of today is me making through it at all ... 
Burn the bridges that you used to keep and you soon wake up to ashes of the mistakes that will always haunt you 
Sad Face : For all the missed chances ...

Breath in and breath out . Let the time passed and wait for the feeling to drown inside . As a smile returnes and I move on 
Had a bad night ... plain and simple 
Is dealing with his own fights at the moment 
Who knew that the greatest fight is the countless war inside 
Is in a constant state of alertness
