A new years resolution is supposed to be kept at all times , right ? My New Year's Resolution is to have my heart beat one more time 

Happy New Years EFL People 
I know that EFL changed me a whole lot and I cant wait to apply that this year . The people I met there are the only reason why I have a FaceBook , that is how special they all are to me . 
< PROPMALE > will be at ComiCon !!!

Why is this wind so friggin HOT ? 
Achh . I left my wall phone charger in Arkansas 
Do we have any AP Physics homework ? 
Synoptic Gospels people , what are the chapters and books that we are able to choose from ? 
Everything that we need to do the rest of our lives needs to be done perfectly . Our grades need to be good so we get a good job . We need to be the best at our jobs to make money . And we need to be the best family person possible . There is too much stress in our lives 
Everyone tells us to get a job we love . That never works out . We get a job we are good at , and for most it is sitting behind a computer talking on the phone and getting harassed by everyone . Is this what the American Dream is ? Is this what we are to become later in life ? 
People say that hate is the opposite of love . I say that apathy is the opposite of love . When you do not care about someone , you are ignoring their existence . Being ignored is one thing that humans are not capable of handling . Humans are social animals who like to be around other of their species , and when one is ignored it feels bad for itself .

ModMyI has their own official app in the app store . Go get it out before apple removes it . If you don't know about ModMyI , its the largest jailbreaking site besides cydia . It has tons of help from people who will help , unlike apple

I had my iPhone hooked up to the wifi , and then I turned on my computer . I got an error message saying someone else ( iphone ) has your IP Address . I heard a few weeks ago that we are running out IP Addresses , who'd have thought it be so soon . 
happiness : a state of well-being and contentment\ 
But what if we want more than that ? What if we want Happiness ? There is no definition for that . If we do not know the definition of something , how are we to know we have attained it ? We do not , we cannot know when or if we have attained Happiness . 
whoops , bye phone and car . TOTALLY worth it though :) 
Got my phone back and * maybe * my car 
1.5 hours for 38 Calc BC problems . I don't think this is going to work 
Got you where I want you . Yea ahh oooooooooooooooo got you where I want you 
i love everyone at school and in life and would do anything for every one of them , but sometimes wonders if any of them feel the same way towards me ... 
< PROPMALE > is on now on NBC . Everyone watch it NOW 
Who watched < PROPMALE > tonight ? 
totally bricked my iphone , itll take a while to get it back to how i wanted it :( 
Oh no Cow Group , I lost my silly band D:

I finally got my Synoptic Gospels Paper written !!! 8 pages too 
Two hours after I order food , we get chicken and tots . Way to friggin go chefs . You know when I get my food at noon I only have a few minutes to eat before I leave work 
just checked my new ACT Score : 30 !!! :D 
people who have txted or called me , i have lost everything from the last 10 days . sorry 
This is ridiculous , there is only ONE radio station where ever the heck I am right now ( Delaware somewhere ) . And people are mad drivers in Philadelphia too 
Delaware is free to enter , but has a $4 ransom to leave 
no school tomorrow 
Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . 
are college applications designed to count the number of lies ? i hope not , or i might get the high score 
And on the Eighth Day God created KFC 
People often wonder about my phone password 1017 . If didn't go to my school freshman year it's ok . But when I say it's a particular date 10/17 I love it how people will give me a hug knowing I was best friends with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > . I love you guys , and I miss you all . I always think of you guys everyday because you all were wonderful people in my life <3 
< PROPMALE > Lunn , I don't know how you do it . It's hard enough for me with this gaping hole in my heart . Everyone seems to forget about you , and I want you to know I love you too 
has it already been 3 years ? feels like yesterday ... 
Wake up , things might get rough . No need to stress , keeps you down too much . Wake up , I heard they found a solution . Where’ll you be for the Revolution ?

Got my EFL Vanderbilt letter today in the mail that I sent to myself . I miss you guys 
i guess ill do the number thing everyone else is doing 
( 1231 ) wow ... thanks is all I can say to you . For everything you do for me , you don't know how much you've helped me . Anyways I think you're absolutely beautiful exactly the way you are and don't change in the least bit . I don't know how we got to be such good friends so quickly , I guess that's what happens when I steal your number when you/your friend put it online and proceed to bother you to no end haha . 
1583\ 
you are a really good person who cares about their friends and isnt afraid to do something outside your comfort zone ( you sit with the seniors at lunch ) . you are an amazing person who is smart and talented at most everything you do , you are most likely going to do well in the business world , if only we could toughen you up . 
finally done with college crap 
when people ask me where i am going for college , is it socially acceptable to hand them a sheet of paper with my answer on it saying \ 
1 . where i am applying \ 
2 . where i want to go\ 
3 . what i will be majoring in ? 
So OSU thinks I'm smart enough to get in ...

hey EFL people in Hawaii !!! how does that country ash whupping feel like ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas EFL People 
21 . I have to say that you are a very special person to me , I don't know what makes S.H. worry so much about you but it doesn't matter . I care for you so very much . You are super cute and special . And you sound pretty smart too ( a VERY big plus for me ) . Sorry I didn't do this earlier , it's because I dont like to fill up people's news feed and I don't like updating very much 
Ending for COD < PROPMALE > was pretty freaking good 
i hope i dont meet someone like you again 
oh my God , my room feels so good
