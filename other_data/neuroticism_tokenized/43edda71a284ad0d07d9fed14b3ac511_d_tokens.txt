I have a friend needing some extra prayers right now . Not my place to say who or why . Just remember her , God will know who you're talking about . 

2 year olds get up way to early !!!! 
Supposed to be severe thunderstorms and tornados tonight and tomorrow . Everyone be careful !!! 
The weather channel is saying it will be all across the 4 state region . Strong tornados likely , golf ball or larger hail , and 80 mph straightline winds . Says they are supposed to be worse tomorrow . 
Work was HORRIBLE today !!! Glad I'm off the rest of the weekend !!!!!! 
Well I didn't win the lottery last night ..... I just knew I had that special ticket this time . LOL !! 
Spring cleaning . Where do all the mountains of filth come from ?!?! 
Loving my new haircut . Everybody needs to go see < PROPFEMALE > at Unique Body Salon in Nashville . She's excellent !! 
HELP !!! My 15 yr old step-son has been asked out for the first time . First of all do 15 yr olds go on dates ?!?! And if so do I need to have a bird and bees talk with him ? Does his dad need to do it ? Someone pointed out yesterday that he probably knows much more about it than I do ( thanks for putting that pic in my head ) . I'm completely lost here ! I'm not ready for a teenager !!! 
I have discovered purse wholesalers !!! I am in heaven !!!! 
When you are a mother , you are never really alone in your thoughts . A mother always has to think twice , once for herself and once for her child . ~ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
Making the decision to have a child is momentous . It is to decide forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body . ~ < PROPFEMALE > Stone

HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL !!!!! 
Why is it that on days we have to get up and be somewhere on time my son has to cling to my leg and whine ???? Any other day he would be playing and watching cartoon's . I do not understand !!! 
The things my son thinks of amazes me sometimes . Occasionally put a little baby powder in his rubber boots so I can get them on him easier . This morning he was playing quietly in his room ( which is not normal ) so I went in to check on him . He had emptied an entire bottle of Gold Bond powder into his boots and put them on . There was powder everywhere !!! 
Lovin < PROPFIRST > DeWyze ! 
It is sooo hard to watch someone you love mess their life up . It's even worse when there is nothing you can do to help them . My brother is an idiot ; ya'll pray for him . 
It's been 2 weeks and I still have a sore throat . And .... I've been using prescription eye drops for 4-5 days and still have pink-eye like symptoms !! I'm falling apart !!!!! 
Got to go to work today . Please let it be better than last weekend !!! 
My mind is restless ........ 
Went to see Eclipse today . I am shocked at how serious people are about it ! People were running and trying to cut in line . And these were the grown women ... not the teenage girls !! 
Job hunting .... does anyone know of anything I might be interested in ? 
A son will hold your hand for awhile , but will hold your heart for a lifetime . If you have a wonderful son that makes your life worth living then copy and repost ... it's son's week . \ " , 201 0-0 7-25 12:42:52 " 
Somewhere right now a nurse is helping a woman become a mother , holding the hand of a dying man , inserting an IV in a child , listening to an Alzheimer's patient tell a story ... and is missing their family while caring for yours . Re-post if you are a nurse , love a nurse , or appreciate a nurse !...... this is soooooooooo true 
My baby told me that he wants to be a doctor when he grows up . I know he's only 2 1/2 but it made me so proud ! LOL 
I am so thankful that we have our own private piece of river to go to . Took the kids swimming and it is so nice not to have to pack , drive , and fight the crowds ! When we get tired we can just jump on the 4-wheeler and go home . It's AWSOME !!! 
Went out and rode the bicycle about 1/4 mile yesterday . It was intense !! I am definately out of shape ! Gonna try for a little longer today . 
Could not get my computer on this morning . I have spent the entire day super upset cause I have to buy a new one . Then < PROPFIRST > comes in from school and plugs it in for me !!! Go figure !!! 
Went to the doc today . He confirmed that Wylie will be having a baby bro or sis in the spring . Due date is April 28th . 
I like it on the coffee table or in the rocking chair . 
Everyday Wylie asks me if the baby is done yet . I guess today he thought he had waited long enough . First thing he done this morning was trying to dig the baby out of my belly button . LOL ! 
Feels like it may rain today ! Let's keep our fingers crossed !!! 
There is going to be a bake sale for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Monday October 25th in the Medical Park Hospital front lobby . Everyone please come by to support our friend and co-worker and his family !! 
Who actually knows me ? I bet NOBODY can answer all the questions . First Name : ______ Middle Name : _____ Last Name : _____ Age : ____ Birthday : _____ Eye Color : _____ Nickname : _____ Favorite Color : ______ Put this as your status and see how many people know you 
Looks like we're going to have another boy !! 
When I did this family tree thing it put some people on there that I am not related to . So ... if you get a family tree request from me and you are not kin .... sorry !! 
I've got to come up with a middle name for this baby ! < PROPMALE > and I can't agree on anything . HELP ! Wyatt_____Hill 
My baby turns 3 today !!! Happy birthday Wylie !!! 
So glad my electricity is back on !!! 
It is 3 degrees outside right now . And .... Justin went to school without a coat !!! What was he thinking ?!?! 
I am sooo ready for spring ! 
We have finally agreed on a name !!! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Hill . 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes !!!! 
This is what I heard this morning between < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . < PROPMALE > : Have you brushed your teeth ? < PROPFIRST > : No . < PROPMALE > : Go brush your nasty teeth before you get on the bus . < PROPFIRST > : Dang Daddy ! I just brushed them yesterday . LOL ! 
My irritability level is definately through the roof today . 
To my children , I make mistakes , sometimes more than I would like to admit , being a mom . But I will always be there for you , to hear you , to cheer you , to laugh or cry with you , to protect you with my life , and to love you for eternity with all my heart ! No one will ever love you more than I do , I'm your mom ! Re-post if you have children , young or adult , that will always be in your heart ... Love my children 
So much to clean and so little energy to do it with . Unloading the dishwasher has me so short of breath that I have to sit and rest . This is ridiculous !! I'll be a very happy lady when < PROPMALE > makes his debut ! 
I think we must have had a little eathquake here last night . < PROPMALE > and I both woke up with the bed shaking around 11:30 . I guess it was either an earthquake or a ghost !!! 
Not feeling so great today .... 
I woke up this morning with the uncontrollable urge to bleach everything in my kitchen . I guess the nesting has started . Maybe it won't be too long until we have a baby !!! 
banana 
No baby today :( Gotta go back Monday . Everyone keep your fingers crossed ! 
Went to the doc today . He says \We're going to have to induce soon . This baby is getting huge ! \ " I said \ " How about today or tomorrow ? \ " He laughs and says \ " Maybe in a week or two . I'll see you back here on Friday . \ " What on earth ?!?! I'm going to explode !!!! "
