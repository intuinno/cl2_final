Central Bucks having is two snow days in a row ! Am I dreaming ? * pinch * Nope . 
\Your the dirty sock ! \ " * British accent ( of course )* " 
Sometimes , I wish I had at tour guide for my own thoughts . Oh , and a filter to stop the thoughts from becoming word vomit . That'd be nice too . 
Yes , I have eaten an insect . 5 actually . Your point ? 
I have nothing on my mind . 
I have some hard decisions to make . Not excited . 
likes the rain . 
I want to go to Scottland . They don't have the SAT or the PSSA . And they have awesome accents . What more could I need ? 
Playn around on her new IMAC PRO . SOOOO FUN ! 
Happy mothers day ! 
FYI : No , my parents did not name me after a drug . The drug was named after me . :) Yay , study hall ! 
I am an ugly man . Thank you Washington , DC < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Parade for informing me of this . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > New for re-enforcing it , just incase I forget . :) 
talking with my graphing calculator :) yay for loss of voice 
Think on the bright side , if you didn't ever have sanity in the first place , at least you can't lose it . 
Feels inspired , yet doesn't have the energy to do anything about it 
Is it perfectly okay that I suck at gym class ? yes . Why ? Because you can bun 15-40 calories every 15 mins you spend laughing ! 
Why I love Spanish , Example 1 :\ 
< PROPFEMALE > Glinka : How do you pronounce \lio\ " ? \ 
My name was used in SAT question ? YES ! Is this the closest I shall ever get to being famous ? YES ! :D Day made . 
Frisbee is not my thing . Just ask my gym class . Then again , neither is getting onto hammocks apparently . Just ask my poor , bruised back from falling off one at Jenn's house . :D 
Smile , love . \ 
It will brighten not only your day\ 
But the life of another\ 
Then maybe this world\

The librarian knows you love to read when you come to check out with a huge BOX of books to renew and check out . :) 
Weirdest thing ever . Gym class was the highlight of my day :) 
acquired tast = enough of your taste buds have died that something bad tastes good 
So , the world has come to the general consensus that I'm a klutz and bad at sports . Ironically , I work at a sports camp and was told today how athletic I am . Day made . :D 
Somehow , I got the whole camp addicted to Ninja this week . Sadly , I still always lose . :) 
Thank-you iPod , nothing like a little < PROPFIRST > McCartney to take SAT/ACT prep and GP research from boring to FUN ! :D 
My new nickname at camp is Godzilla because of my ... tendency :) ... for ( unintentional ) violence during soccer games . 
On TV , when the lifeguards run on the beach ( in slow motion , of course ) , they always look fabulous and perfect . \ 
In real life , when I run on the beach , I trip , fall , and sprain my ankle . 
So , I realized today that I have a Facebook addiction ( whew , first step done ) . So , in order to combat this growing problem , I am only going on Facebook on Friday's . Frankly , with the amount of time I waste on Facebook I could have ... done something very important , I'm sure . :D \ 
\ 
I doubt any of you will need to , but if you need me , reach me on my cell ( I'll respond when I find it ... ) , or email . 
Highlight of my week : Meeting a new friend . :) 
Last Day of Camp . Miss it Already . :(

Snow day = working ahead on homework so I don't drown in it . Fun , fun . :) 
well , at least it isn't broken ... 
Even when the rain falls\ 
Even when the flood starts rising\ 
Even when the storm comes\ 
I am washed by the water\ 
Even if the Earth crumbles under my feet\ 
Even if the ones I love turn around and crucify me\ 
I won't never ever let you down\ 
won't fall , won't fall , won't fall as long as you're around me . \ 
~ Washed by the Water , Needtobreathe
