I'm spending waay too much time on my laptop ...

What does it mean to be strong ? Is strength being willing to suffer through the most torturous pain , or is strength being able to move forward by letting go of whatever that pain might be , and all that that entails ? I guess ... it depends on who you are , what you want , and what you're willing to risk . Yay for being philosophical through status updates . 
Dinner with my parents , and I'm not getting kidnapped for the whole weekend this time ! :) 
Descisions , descisions ... and a fair bit of soul-searching . I hope this is all valid , I really do . 
all this drama ... i regret not having first experienced it in the easier-to-deal-with high school setting . 
registering for classes ... i hate the stupid gen < PROPMALE > requirements .

Please copy and paste this into your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for people who need a punch in the face , except , a punch in the face . 93% of people won't repost this , why ? Because ... they probably need a punch in the face . 
\Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes ME using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy

Kentucky just passed the best law ever ; to be on food stamps , Medicaid , or cash assistance for your children or yourself , you have to pass a drug test . Now every other state should do the same . People that work have to take a drug test , and so should they . If you agree , re-post . 
My phone is broken , somehow . I'll tell y'all when i fix it or get a new one , but until then ... facebook me , e-mail me , skype me , etc . love you all ! 
My phone is magically fixed-ed ! So text away , my friends XD

status updates seem to be too much like public personal journals . i hope it isn't hypocritical that i'm making this statement . 
I hate not being able to sleep . 
No classes !!! :D Awesomeness abounds !!! XD 
Never had I so completely driven away a person before . 
Yo anyone that received anything from my Yahoo IM account about an IQ test ... that wasn't me . it might have given you some form of spyware , please run an antivirus scan on your computers ASAP . i'm really sorry about this . 
I want all my facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me , but I want you to LIE . That's right , lie . Just make stuff up . Be creative . After you comment , make this your status so I can do the same ! :) 
i've never heard of the band \the crap\ " in my life . thank god they don't exist ... :P "

You and I wake up in a police cell together . Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . :) Be a good sport and play along ; four words is harder than you think . :P 
Show me your broken feet . - < PROPFIRST > Meeks

I really need to start sleeping ... 
I am in dire need of strength . 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
Day of Silence is tomorrow ... Do I want to go all the way and not say anything for the whole day ? Hmmm ...
