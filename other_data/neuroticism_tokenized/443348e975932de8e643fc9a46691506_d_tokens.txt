If I can't find an outlet for certain issues soon , I'm going to end up dead ; once again bleeding out on the edge of my own damned blade . 

If anyone can tell me how things always manage to go from great to completely screwed in a matter of minutes , it'd be much appreciated . Losing months worth of my life , and more sanity than I can spare over and over again is getting extremely old . 
The epitome of ' More than you bargained for . ' is when the girl you went home with asks , with a dead serious look on her face ; \Have you ever fisted a girl before ? \ " I don't think a monday could've been more colorful .. :: sigh :: " 
Tonight is one of those nights when owning a firearm would make everything so much simpler because I could splatter my brains across a wall and not have to worry about anything anymore .. Cause i'd be dead .

Mt brother stabbed me in the face with a broken fan handle and in the neck with a piece of wooden doorframe .. My day is officially complete .
