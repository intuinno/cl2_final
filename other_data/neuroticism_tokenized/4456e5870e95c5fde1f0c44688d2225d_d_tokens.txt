Some people have \little\ " or \ " no\ " personality . They talk about the same thing over and over and over again . They remind me of living zombies if you ask me . " 

Got my dog a haircut . He looks small compared to all that fur he had on him . lol ! 
Drinking green tea with pomegranate . Chillin like a niggalin ! lol !!! I stayed up since yesterday . I don't even feel tired . I love staying up late because it just makes me feel like my day isn't over . :) 
Can't wait to talk to my counselor at vvc about my career change tomorrow . :) 
Ok ... so today was not what I expected to be . I was eager to talk to my counselor and so on . 1 ) Spring Break and 2 ) I have to wait until June to do so . That seems kind of long time . I want to get everything done ... like right now . I went into the office and how they set everything up is < PROPFEMALE > tacky . How they set the desk around makes the room look ugly . 
After leaving the college , my mom and I went to buy some things for the house . This lady kept honking her damn horn at us . It really irritated me . It would make sense for her to go around right ? Totally immature on her part . How did I deal with it ? We passed her up and I threw a middle finger at her . \Math Formula of the Day \"- Impatience+Disrespect+Ignorance = \ " Fuck You\ " !!! It only takes two . :) " 
Just finished making a fruit salad . ( Watermelon , Blueberries , Honey Dew Melon , Cantaloupe , Grapes , Oranges , Kiwi , Strawberries , Pineapples , Apples , and Whipped Cream ) 
My pets are starting to get on my last nerves . They need to stop being < PROPFEMALE > bad all the time .

It is about time < PROPMALE > McMahon got what was coming to him ! lol ! He had all those guys attack < PROPFIRST > Cena , and at the end they surprisingly turned on him . That really made my day . Now he should finally know how it feels to get jumped by a group of guys . :) 
Is going to watch some classic movies . :)

Is taking Math 10 and Beginning Acting this Fall Semester coming up . I had never took an acting class before . So ... if any of you took acting before or recently , let me know any extra tips of what I need to know . You can even tell me how your experience was like for you in the class . Anything would be helpful . Thank you ! :) 
Is planning on going to see about my money for school today or tomorrow . I'm not worried because I'm pretty confident that its there . I just know that my money better be there because I am not playin . 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so they are not contagious . They want what we all want , which is to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . But will you please do it and leave it on your status for at least one hour ? It's special education week ... and this is in honor of all those kids . 
I'm tired of this hot weather yo !!!! 
My day was alright . Can't wait for tomorrow . :) 
I will find out one way or the other who the culprit is who keeps giving me prank calls for the 7th time already ! I have faith in my close friends , but I better not find out if any one of you gave my number out to strangers ! If this person calls me again , s/he better be prepared to have their feelings hurt ! I'm mad as hell and not in the mood for the childish antics ! GROW UP & STOP CALLING MY FUCKING PHONE ! 
I just ? to stay up late . :) 
Until you make peace with who you are , you're never happy with what you have . 
This scene I am working on in my acting class is driving me crazy ! I'll be alright hopefully if < PROPFIRST > shows up on Monday to rehearse it with me . 
I know that I have received an A in my acting class after today . Very proud of my acting partner < PROPFIRST > for staying focused and being supportive . Most of all , I am proud of myself on how much I progressed since these last 5 months . :) 
This weather has been a trip . Its been pouring for 2 straight days and its freezing cold .

I enjoyed my aunts company after not seeing her for over a year . Sometimes that broad can be something else . Well , it was nice seeing her again . 
I've watched \Due Date\ " and that movie is just hilarious as hell ! Haven't laughed this hard since watching < PROPMALE > & Borat : Cultural Learnings of < PROPFEMALE > for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan . :) " 
I can't stand weird random people calling my phone ! This psycho woman calls me without giving me her first name , asks me if I had a social network & even claimed that I was her husband . When I told her that she got the wrong number , she didn't want to believe me despite the fact that she knew that I don't even sound like her so called husband . * Ignorance * 
Is happy to hear that my friend < PROPFEMALE > is doing okay after her surgery . 
Enjoyed the movie \Karate Kid 2010\ " . That kid ( Jaden Smith ) went from getting beat up to kicking their ass . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > is always awesome . " 
Pretty happy that < PROPFEMALE > stopped by to visit me . :) 
Why is it that the people I care about have to turn into a disappointment ? 
Feeling content just by how my day is going . :) 
\Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do . \ " < PROPMALE > Asimov " 
Yeeeesssssss !!!! The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim ( Video Game ) will come out this year . Due Date is 11-11-2011 . Hopefully it is better than the last . I know I sounded like a nerd but I don't care . lol ! 
It snowed a little today . I want more snow !!! lol !
