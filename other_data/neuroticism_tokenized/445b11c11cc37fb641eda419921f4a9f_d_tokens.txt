Another one crosses over . RIP < PROPFIRST > . I love you . Miss you already 

After trying FOREVER to potty train < PROPFEMALE > and then giving up she decided to just start going by herself , no big deal . As of friday ( june 11 ) she doesn't wear diapers at all , not even to bed . So far only two accidents , one when we were at the park and once when she was too busy playing with a puppy to be bothered . 
Well , got to see 2 of the kids for Father's Day but no < PROPMALE > :( He called from North < PROPFEMALE > and wished me a happy dad day and apologized for not being here :) he's such a sweetie 
I hate people ... and that probably includes YOU !!! 
is wondering why I choose to keep believing in the goodness of mankind . And why I keep being hurt and shocked at the evil things certain people will do . If I keep having faith that someone is a good person , despite the fact that the person proves over and over that it simply isn't true , does that make me insane ? Or just stupid ? 
... 
$$$$ ... $ 
Are you freaking stupid ... Or is that me ? 
STOP ALL 
Don't know what was up with stop all ... somebody else was on my damn account . Oops . So anything I might have said tyo anyone that was embarrasing , that wasn't me . If it was cool ... fuck it , I'll take the credit . 
Some piece of shit came into my sons room and stole his Xbox 360 . They only took the powercord and the box , no games no cord to hook it to the tv ... so if anyone hears of someone trying to sell just an Xbox 360 plus powercord , let me know 
New Walking Dead tonite , yay ... season finale , boo ! 
Sometimes I'm a < PROPMALE > ... Sorry . 
Shut up , you talk too much 
I need some zombies to kill . I wish The Walking Dead would come back on . 
Sometimes I wonder why we waste time and emotion on people who make it VERY clear that it IS a waste
