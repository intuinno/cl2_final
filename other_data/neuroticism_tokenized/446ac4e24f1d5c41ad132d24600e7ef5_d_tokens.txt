The remedy is the experience . This is a dangerous liaison , I say the comedy is that it's serious . This is a strange enough new play on words , I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend The rest of your nights with the light on , So shine the light on all of your friends , When it all amounts to nothing in the end . 
Wake up little < PROPFEMALE > , wake up ! Wake up little < PROPFEMALE > , wake up !.... shut up . if i dont wanna , i dont wanna . 
whenever i think about how we have drifted apart , it breaks my heart . why does time separate us when its supposably heals us ? u obviously have no idea how empty i felt when we saw each other recently . its like we're complete strangers now instead of the true companions we were . i wish it was all a bad dream , but i must face reality and press forward and hope for the best . hope . hope . and hope .
