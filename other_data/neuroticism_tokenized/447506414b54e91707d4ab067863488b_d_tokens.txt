Hey MIC Family ... who ' m I gonna see in December ???? 
It's Diabetes Awareness Month . It isn't pink or sexy , it doesn't involve boobs , football players or cute t-shirts . It's about being grateful whenyou/your loved one wakes up in the morning . It's 3am blood sugar checks , needles , low blood sugars and the smell of insulin on your handsafter changing a pumpsite or filling a syringe . That's a diabetic's life . Repost this if you have or love someone with diabetes .
