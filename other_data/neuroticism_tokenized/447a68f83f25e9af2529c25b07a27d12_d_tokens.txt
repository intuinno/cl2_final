<=== playing the pillow for the dogs ! Just a couch potato today ( watching basketball games ans reading ) . 

May there always be work for your hands to do ; May your purse always hold a coin or two ; May the sun always shine on your windowpane ; May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain ; May the hand of a friend always be near you ; May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you . and may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead . 
< PROPFIRST > , I put 3 credits for Summer A , 3 for Summer B , and 3 for Summer C . < PROPFIRST > , tthe forms are on the gray tab on the self-serve < PROPFEMALE > . 
May those that love us , love us . And those that don’t love us , May God turn their hearts . And if he doesn’t turn their hearts , May he turn their ankles , So we’ll know them by their limping .
