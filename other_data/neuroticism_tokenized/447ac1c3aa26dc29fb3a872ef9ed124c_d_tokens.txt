is totally pigging out on some delicious ramen ! :P Yum ! 
has become a little piggy . * scarfs down food like a vacuum cleaner * 
is thinking philosophically on how different people become through interactions with many different people within their lifetimes . She wonders about the developing cacoon - on how the larva will possibly never stop changing until the day it opens its new- 
has just sent a proposal ( more like protest ) email to the graphic arts chair at NJCL to request ( forcefully ask ) some rules to be changed . She will feel a little better about her disqualification if she knows that people in future NJCL conventions wouldn't have to go through what she did . :[ 
finds it funny how everyone is suddenly on facebook this late at night and not during the day . :P 
is in extreme pain due to wisdom teeth removal . > o <

isn't looking forward to tonight because it sure won't be a happy night ... probably . * blames someone but not going to say a name * 
actually feels a little detached from her high school life already since she failed to cry yesterday at the gathering . ): 
is reading \The Naked Roomate : And 107 Other Issues You Might Run Into in College\ " because her mother is making her . xD And it's good ! * recommends it to all people heading off to the world to do their own things * " 
is creeped out by < PROPFIRST > Youngman's profile picture - it's just something < PROPFIRST > shouldn't do or show . 
is completely and totally scatter-brained because she told everyone that college is next week , a LOOOONG long time away , but in reality , she leaves this Saturday . T.T And on a side note , she feels awful because her mom most likely fractured her arm when she tripped over a sitting stool in DSW because they were buying flats for college together . D: 
has decided what classes she's thinking about registering for with her adviser . xD w00t ! But on the other hand , she has no clue what group A and group B science courses ( and their differences ) are . X_X 
just finished watching 27 dresses with her bestie , a cat named Frazier . Lol jk . I mean < PROPFEMALE > . And no , < PROPFEMALE>'s a person , not a cat .

is hoping that the registrar hasn't booted her out of English . =/ 
is really mad that she got the boot from English 175 but is thankful to < PROPMALE > and two other individuals for cheering her up . =)

is slightly confused by the fact that some people just yelled \WIESS ! THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED ! \""

was beyond amused by several people's facial expressions today . =P

accidentily overslept her \nap \"...=/" 
hates coughing ! 
wants the tests over and the weekend here already . 
thinks that the view outside of 6th floor Fondren ( minus the tall skyscrapers and crane ) reminds her of Casta la Mare and Sicily . She wants her canvas and brushes ... 
thinks that after dinner , there should be a group meeting to understand the meaning of matrices - are they pointless , or are they actually useful ? 
knows that she'll probably fail the Diff . Eq . test almost 100% . =/ FML 
enjoyed making buttons and walking to Walgreens/Starbucks with < PROPFEMALE > . =)

wants to know how she did on the Physics midterm now ... but then again ... if she failed , she'd rather stay under her rock . 
feels conflicted : Big Bang or Wiess v . < PROPMALE > game . D: 
thinks she's leaning towards Big Bang but the fact that Wiess might be DQed because they don't have enough people to play < PROPMALE > is guilt tripping her . =( 
was a man ... =D TFW ! 
is officially HOME ! =) And her fat cat still remembers her . :O This is sooooo relaxing .. |3 
learned 3 things tonight : 1 . Don't take all your good clothes to college ... you'll find that you're in an awful predicament when you have a semi-nice event and all you have are t-shirts from High school ... 2 . To get in that predicament , don't put off your laundry for 2 weeks .... 3 . Don't expect non-Asians to fully respect and admire Asian Culture . =/ It just doesn't work out that way ... 
is enjoying her coffee with Biscotti . |3 Yumm ... 
thinks that if you really want to get technical with Asian stereotyping , you need to consider the following : cool FOBs , nerd FOBs , smart ABCs , not-so-smart ABCs , non-asian ABCs , CBA wannabes , Asian-asian CBAs , and BANANAS/TWINKIES and honorary Azns !! :O

really enjoyed her bonding time with the Baldwin piano in the Wiess conference room . =D 
failed to resuscitate her ipod - even with head-tilt chin-lift and the Heimlich manuever . =( 
' s life is finally complete now that Physics is done and checked . =D 
is sad that she lost her banned books button of holy amazingness . :'( 
is so happy to be done with Diff . Eq ! Now for a date with her bed ... running on less than 18 hours of sleep over a course of 4 days is really not fun . 
just totally gave the Rice freshmen class a bad name by f-ing up her first essay on the Rice College Assessment . =/ 
is still sleepy despite 13 hours of sleep ... -_- ... time to tackle some physics ... 
wants to have a date with the Baldwin but people are in the conference room . D:

is in Iowa . Now what ? 
can't get a signal at all . So if I got a text from you and haven't replied it's probably because a ) I didn't get it b ) I can't answer c ) I don't like you . I can promise that it's probably a or b but who knows ... :D 
What I got out of Immuno today : \Hey kids ! Don't forget to wash your hands or you just might start shedding ... ALL OF YOUR SKIN ! \ " \ 
sunburns hurt . I thought Asians weren't supposed to burn . :(

Professor Hebl : \When aliens come to earth 
When in doubt , use parasitic worms . Immunology has taught me so much about life .

Pocket God has taken over my life . I'm a pitiful excuse for a human . :( 
What I've taken out of college thus far : caffeine is your best friend . Chug it , pop it , shoot it up - it makes the world seem like a better place ... until it wears off . Then you need MORE . ALWAYS MORE . 
Good News : No broken bones . No fractures . < PROPFEMALE > . Zip . All bones a-okay ! \

so I can now say that I broke < PROPFIRST > O'Connor's camera when he tried to take a photo of me . 
is home !!! Also a pair of mourning doves have decided to \nest\ " ( this behavior identification is currently questionable ) on our railing ... yay ? " 
so apparently the neighbors called the cops this morning thinking someone was breaking in when it was only my dad cleaning bird poop off of our railing , courtesy of the mourning doves . I don't know whether to laugh or be embarrassed ... 
I feel accomplished : biked over 70 < PROPMALE > this weeks . 
Still does not understand why there was a guy wearing a teletubbie costume at the < PROPMALE > Potter opening night . 
MCAT HELL IS FINALLY OVER . TGIF .
