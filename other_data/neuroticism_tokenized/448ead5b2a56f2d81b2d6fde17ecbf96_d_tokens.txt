Comment on this with your favorite verb . 
Fuck you < PROPFIRST > Creel . Where the hell is my assignment about you ? 
Oddly refreshed and contemplative . 
Is energetic . 
Sexual innuendo is a hard topic to stay abreast of . As a humor tool , it stands erect in the English language . While there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes sexual innuendo , many people have mass-debated over the topic , and now the general principles at the root of the topic are firm and well-rounded . 
Is pretty stoked 
Now there's nothing dark and there's nothing weird , don't be afraid , I will hold you near , from the seance where , you first betrayed , an open heart on a darkened stage .... a celebration .... of your teenage station .

\Too much momentum ... \"" 
Roasted pepper Hummus with pickles and whole wheat bread = Excellent sandwich . 
\Believe in me/ believe in nothing/ corner me and make me something \"" 
Shaking my head , trying to clear the mist . I'm so sorry to everyone I pissed off today ( Mr. Bowen and < PROPFEMALE > come to mind ) . I'm not sure who I am anymore . I just know that I say things that I don't mean , and the things I do mean I don't say . This is just like when I found out there was no < PROPFEMALE > , although this time I'm finding out that there's no love and no < PROPFEMALE > . 
Can't get enough of the sudden spring air . 
Damn you for being beautiful haha 
What the fuck happened to my status !??! 
So sick ... ugh 
There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life : The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged . One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes , leading to an emotionally stunted , socially crippled adulthood , unable to deal with the real world . The other , of course , involves orcs .? 
The video for Lady GaGa's \Telephone\ " . I'm so uncomfortable right now . "

It's true ; no man is an island . We are merely strands in a great web , and whatever the hell is making you hate yourself and act so crazy I want to fix , not directly for myself , but I know I won't be happy until you are . 
Mankind is a virulent parasite . 
Is worried about attendees to the 2010 world cup , South African and otherwise . Not a good situation at all . 
Facebook is dead .

class today for a sales pitch disguised as a motivational speech . Just \ 
shut up and sell me my freakin ' Gown . Or don't . Just don't interrupt my \

Just spent an hour talking to some Mormon Missionaries . I figured they probably had enough people ignore them . 
Every day is worse than the previous , but I'm kind of excited ; at this rate , I'll contract a rare Brazilian lung flu next Thursday and Armageddon should arrive ' round Thanksgiving . 
Whatever you do , don't call 240-328-0034 . It's hilarious . 
Snow ??! In October ? 2010 you are full of surprises . 
Really doesn't want to start applying to colleges , but should already have . Can I stay in this nebulous , indeterminate space of time WITHOUT screwing up ?

If you think you might be wrong , you're probably right . 
18.75% of High School to go . ugh . 
As weird as this is coming from me , maybe religion IS important . 
You better check yo self before you wreck yo self ' Cos I'm bad for your health

You know how they say there's that one perfect person out there for you , and it's so sad you'll never find them ? Well the flip-side of that is that there's someone out there who would drive you suicidal , their personality so perfectly calibrated to piss you off . So at least you'll never meet them .

Why the hell haven't I been watching Community !? 
It's weird ; At Academic team matches , I'm about as good as you'd expect me to be : slow , and heavily skewed towards Literature . However , once I consume several boxes of nerds and smarties , I become an omniscient dynamo , answering questions with a two-word prompt . Goes to show the importance of blood sugar . 
Happy Hanukkah , in case anyone's jewish . 
What's with all the cartoon profile pictures ? 
Maybe its just post-concert vibes , but all the stress and angst I was weighed down by seems to have evaporated . Onward ! 
My 5-year-old brother just played me his themesong , composed on a baby zylophone , with lyrics about how he has a quick temper and likes Chocolate too much , but looks good in a suit . I am definitely not the talented one in this family .

DOOMED . 
Spent all day in a little room for skipping my weightlifting class , discovered the loss and destruction of LAMP , and then single-handedly snatched defeat from the hands of victory at A-team . This was almost a terrible day . 
Wants to know more about the Arizona shooting , but is too depressed to look it up . Why does this shit keep happening ?

Because I throw myself at things until they break or let me win . 
Don't be nice to recruiters unless you're actually thinking of enlisting ; being polite comes across as being interested . I just talked to the < PROPFEMALE > guy for like half an hour and ended up giving him my medical history . Just like that time I listened to the Mormon guys .

Something needs to be said ; 3D is stupid . It's practically made up ; I personally never notice a difference .
