Wow 3 month's already since having my daughter < PROPFEMALE > . I am amazed . 10/19/09 she started to roll over but can't get herself back onto her back so she throws a hissy fit . All her first are happening . Im thankful I get to see them and enjoy them . I'd have alot of guilt missing out on it all . Im a first time mother to my own child so it's alot different but I love it . 
Spending time with my sweet baby girl . She had her 4 month check-up(11/23/09 ) and her 4 month shots . she is 12lbs 11oz 24 inches . So she is gaining but you can't tell that much cause she is long . She is running fevers off an on and just not really happy and wanting to be around me and my parents mostly . So the next couple days are going to be < PROPMALE > . So I will talk as I can . 
Wondering If Me Asking for anything for Christmas will be worth much at all . Cause Im not after much . The very Few things I do want . I honestly doubt I'd even get so I don't know . I am debating bothering with Christmas due to those facts . Only reason my daughter will have it is due to my parents etc . I can't do anything for anyone so I really dunno . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Spending time with my 5 month old baby girl < PROPFEMALE > . She is enjoying her gifts so far and the day has only begun .. 
Happy ! < PROPFEMALE > has been having a blast with her presents to the point she eats and passes out to sleep . Christmas was amazing for the first time in years . A few of my best friends , and Family made it even better for me , but most of all < PROPFEMALE > just seeing her being super happy an content meant the world to me . < PROPFEMALE > -clothes , and toys . Me-makeup etc , clothes , 2 cds , and the new Sony walkman mp3 player ! Thanks everyone .

So I was right about my sweet baby girl being sick ! Serious ear infections again . Teething really blows now I really know why my Mum hated it . I am still thinking & questioning alot . I even wonder about alot lately especially with what all I am experiencing & feeling recently . Some of it is making me sick just like before a long time ago .

I can not take this anymore saying everything I've said before . - Linkin Park One Step Closer - I am sick & tired of dealing with alot of the bullshit I deal with especially from someone who claimed to care among other things . Learn to grow up , I did a very long time ago . I will not go through the crap again I feel like I am . Your starting to remind me of the one person I can't bare to look at ever again in my life . 
Ever get to the point that you start questioning your whole relationship with someone ? I feel like Im at that point lately . It's like I never do anything right . Im some how or way the bad person . I Don't know what the person wants from me . Or if they want me because of how they act , yet point the finger at me . I feel very lost . I love you so much < PROPFEMALE > MaKenzie-Lee your my everything baby girl always & forever !
