Dear Lord , I've been asked , nay commanded , to thank Thee for the Christmas turkey before us ... a turkey which was no doubt a lively , intelligent bird ... a social being ... capable of actual affection ... nuzzling its young with almost human-like compassion . Anyway , it's dead and we're gonna eat it . Please give our respects to its family . ~ Berke Breathed , Bloom County Babylon

ok people that stuff falling from the sky is called RAIN . cold and wet RAIN . it is WATER . in order for it to be snow it would actually have to be somewhat FROZEN . I'm sorry but apparently a lot of people on this island have forgotten wut snow is xD 
the greatest tragedy is not death , but a life without purpose . 
pineapple birthday cake and a scary movie marathon with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > =] it was awesome 
what is the difference between unconditional love and letting someone walk all over you or treat you badly without getting mad ? 
note to self : somethings were just not meant for facebook discussion . 
ATTENTION PEOPLE IN SWILLEY'S CHEMISTRY HONORS CLASS : I talked to her today after school and she told me that we are doing a s'mores lab tomorrow and that we need to bring in marshmallows , < PROPMALE > crackers , and Hershey's chocolate bars .

making cookies . 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality , tied in a single garment of < PROPFEMALE > . Whatever affects one directly , affects all indirectly . 
THIS IS YOUR LIFE . are you who you want to be ? 
Don't wait for time to heal or fix things because , actually , time itself is neutral : it can be used either destructively or constructively . 
just saw < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland in Imax 3-D with < PROPFEMALE > Willbur , Catie L ., and < PROPFEMALE > Jones . We had to wake up at like 6am but it was awesome . 
So the question is not whether we will be extremists , but what kind of extremists we will be . Will we be extremists for hate or for love ? 
my chains are gone , i've been set free 
is enjoying her birthday and listening to Almost < PROPFEMALE > thanks to < PROPFIRST > McGrath ! I really appreciate all of the birthday wishes ! You all are the best =] thank you for making my day <3 much love everyone .

men in black is a pretty freaking awesome movie < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > =] 
my youth group is amazing . i love it when things make sense =D 
Young men go to war . Sometimes because they have to , sometimes because they want to . Always , they feel they are supposed to . This comes from the sad , layered stories of life , which over the centuries have seen courage confused with picking up arms , and cowardice confused with laying them down . 
\He's gona be dead everyday unless you get the potion ! \ " -little < PROPMALE > =] Babysitting was so much fun . When was the last time you played with dolls ? haha " 
does anyone know what the spanish 3 hw was for betris ? 
Holding anger is a poison . It eats you from inside . We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us . But hatred is a curved blade . And the harm we do , we do to ourselves . 
is leaving for North < PROPFEMALE > soon and is taking < PROPFIRST > McGrath so that she can go see her brother . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > O'Keeffe for puppysitting . =]

I love < PROPFEMALE > Willbur and Catie L . Thank you for coming to youth group tonight and for listening to me . <3 
when so many are lonely as seem to be lonely , it would be inexcusably selfish to be lonely alone . 
Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light . 
Please understand my reasons for not speaking today . I am participatingin the Day of Silence ( DOS ) , a national youth movement bringing attention to the silence faced by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people and their allies . My deliberate silence echoes that silence , whichis caused by anti-LGBT bullying , name-calling and harassment . 
I believe that ending the silence is the first step toward building awareness and making a commitment to address these injustices . Think about the voices you are not hearing today . 
I believe that bullying of ANY kind , of ANYone , and for ANY reason is intolerably wrong , whether you are gay , lesbian , straight , bisexual , or transgender . Even if you are against LGBT rights , I hope you can agree that no innocent person deserves to be bullied or harassed because of their lifestyle or beliefs . 
so who participated in Day of Silence and succeeded in not talking all day ? lol or at least tried ? 
excited to go to the pool today 
pool was cold but it was nice anyway 
just took my doggie back to the vet for the second time in the past few days . First he had stomach problems and now there is something wrong with his throat . He's so sad and miserable and in so much pain and it makes me wana cry . They better help him this time . 
I love my dog . Thank God he's home and he's ok . That was such a scare . 
God is love . Learn the word , love the word , live the word , and be free of worry . Give your life to him . He will provide , protect , and never leave you ! Trust him . -bathroom door at a rest stop somewhere in VA I believe it was . No kidding haha you find God in the most unlikely places . <3

Where's your gravel ? Your jury ? What's my offense this time ? You're not a judge , but if your gonna judge me , well sentence me to another life . 
is getting rebaptised today at Burke's Beach =] 
no clear thesis at all ; anarchy on paper 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS WEEK and 1 in 3 of us will 
to the airport 
flight delayed ... yay ... 
New York for the weekend . Yay for my cousin's communion . 
A random man just came up to us in the airport and gave me , my mom , my sister , and my brother two free bottles of water for no other reason except to be nice . I love people . 
So after getting free water , we walk onto the plane and the pilot randomly decides to pull us aside to show us the cockpit . Did you know that planes are steered with nothing except for a joystick ? It's like a video game . Everyone is being so nice today . Maybe it's because of mother's day . 
does not and will never understand math . Especially in chemistry . 
So we left on time and everything seemed to be going perfectly and we actually got to New York but then the weather was too bad to land so they closed down the airport and we flew in circles for 2 hours until we ran out of fuel and were forced to land in Atlantic City . Who knows what we're going to do now ? 
So we're apprently reboarding in ten mins woot woot ! But while we were waiting everyone started getting hungry and some girl found crackers in her bag and shared them with everyone , exclaming \yes !! we're not gona die !! \ " lol . My faith in humanity always seems to be restored during flight delays . " 
Although we are about 4 or 5 hours late , we have in fact made it to New York . 
has a lot of < PROPFEMALE > Willbur time to make up for <3 
Landed . And now for the drive home . No delays for once ! 
Claudia : You don't even know what < PROPFEMALE > means ! Adam : Well ... No I don't but I know it's something like wrapping them up on a chair ... 
everyone has limits . sometimes the only way to expand your limits is to push them . love the people who sometimes push you to your limits . 
Carwash today at Outback from 12-2pm . Be there . 
i love my dog . a lot . 
You gain one , you lose one . It will balance out somehow someday . 
Sweet dreams are made of this , Who am I to disagree ? Travel the world and the seven seas , Everybody's looking for something

Sometimes fiction can travel further than truth and sometimes made up stories can mean more than history . 
So what did you think the devil would look like ? If he were red with a tail , horns , and cloven hooves , any fool could say no . 
Today at work someone asked if there was a beach close by on < PROPMALE > Head Island and how to get there ... 
< PROPFIRST > Swidzinski just beat me at bowling ... complete with his super cool dance moves . 
Bye < PROPMALE > Head . I'm leaving you for two weeks .

I hate letting go of people . 
Love babysitting <3 
I enjoy my job . My coworkers are awesome . 
Why does God allow evil to exist ? Because a believer cannot be saved unless the choice to follow Christ is freely made , unless the option to not follow him genuinely exists . Compelled belief is no belief at all . 
Ronie Shirin-Bitton and I are taking over < PROPMALE > , then < PROPFEMALE > , then Mexico , then Poland and finally < PROPFEMALE > together :) 
bottle of reality ... where do u think i can get one of those ? -me from the store across the street called \desperate for delusion\ " - Ronie Shirin-Bitton "

There will always be a way out or at least a way to deal . Sometimes you wont be able to deal with it alone and sometimes you won't be able to see a way out until someone else shows you . When all else fails , don't be afraid to ask for help . God doesn't put people in situations they can't handle . 
Change your profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until monday there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is a campaign to stop violence against children . 
I am giving up texting this week for advent .

Repost to your < PROPFEMALE > if you agree 
The brain processes loneliness in the same area as physical pain . It's better to be treated badly by someone than to be ignored by someone . 
is now viewing weatherhead's powerpoints on her phone since the computer that has powerpoint doesn't have internet and the computer has internet doesn't have powerpoint and the computer that has both also has a password lock that no body knows . awesome . well thank goodness for iphone's . 
Stress humans allow themselves to go through is much more detrimental than the situation that is causing the stress even has the potential to be . Our bodies ' have the same response to everyday stress ( sweating , raised heart rate and breathing ) that an animal would have running for its life . No zebra trying to escape from a lion could understand how a human could get just as stressed out about something like traffic . 
Tonight I can look up at the stars , and swear they are nothing but bullet holes 
Who died and made you < PROPMALE > of anything ?

Intentions matter . People can change . But the best predictor of the person we will be is the person we have been . Wherever we go , we take ourselves along .

is losing her mind and about half of everything else . 
I don't understand having to write introductions and conclusions in papers . I already told you what I was going to talk about in my introduction , then I spent at least three paragraphs talking about it , and now you really want to hear me summarize it all again ? =\\ why don't you just pay attention the first time ? 
losing yourself leaves a space for something larger 
Adam : Can you cut off that piece of my pizza ? Mom : Why ? Adam : It touched bacon . =] my brother is totally going to grow up to be a vegetarian <3 
I decided I wanted to make the world a better place , so one day I looked at the girl in the mirror and asked her to make a change .
