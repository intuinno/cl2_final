I was the emcee last night for the Arts Festival Idol competition . 6 amazingly talented tots competed to be selected for finals night Sat ! 
I have decided to do a sprint triathlon !! Deciding between the Routh 66 on June 5 or OKC Super Sprint on June 12 . Anyone want to join me ? 
So , I just got back from the ARTS festival ... and somehow missed all the < PROPMALE > ! The food , however , was quite captivating ! 
I woke up to the smell of homemade chocolate chip pancakes and my daughter jumping on my head ... I love Saturday mornings !! 
After the 1.5 mi jog I had this morning , I was fairly optimistic about this triathlon thing ... then I did 25m in the pool and almost died !! 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > Fleming , winner of last night's Festival Idol finals ! Think < PROPFIRST > Sinatra , < PROPFIRST > Armstrong & < PROPFIRST > Botti all in 1 - WOW ! 
2 fashion shows this week : < PROPFEMALE > Meyers Thurs & Jones NY Sat - modeling in one and official stylist for the other ... styling is waaaay harder ! 
2 mile jog + 8 mile bike today ! Getting there little by little ... tomorrow is swim/bike . Ugh ! 
Got fitted for the < PROPFEMALE > Meyers fashion show today . Found out one look is SWIMWEAR !!! Soooooo not ready for swimwear yet !! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s 1st school recital ... of course , she was the ONLY one that stood up , pulled her dress over her head & nearly poked a girl's eye out ! 
I was the stylist for the Jones New York fashion show today at Dillard's Penn Square featuring < PROPMALE > Boston ! Great show , great models !! 
Had a swimwear shoot for Distinctly OK Mag today at a gorgeous million $ home & last Tues < PROPFEMALE > at Arcadia Lake - awesome job models !!

Ok ! New blog : www.mrsrouba.blogspot.com . :) 
Happy birthday to my handsome husband Yury Rouba ! So ... his birthday is technically June 8 , but he was born at 6:30 am in Belarus so that makes his actual birthday 10:30 pm on June 7 in Oklahoma ... ha ! Foreigners ... 
So , I learned at the Mrs. TX pageant that the reigning Mrs. Oklahoma , < PROPFEMALE > Baldwin Siler , has pretty much the most incredible voice I've ever heard !!!! Not kidding - I could listen to her sing all day and never get sick of it . Why are you not on broadway , girl ??? 
I was just getting excited about the prospect of NOT being rained in tomorrow ... when miss < PROPFEMALE > came in our room and threw up all over the floor ! Ugh ... that means no school for her tomorrow ... which means another day at home all day ! 
So sometimes Yury teaches < PROPFEMALE > Russian . And sometimes he just makes up words and teaches them to her . I have no idea how she is supposed to keep everything straight ! 
We need your help ! For the Distinctly Oklahoma Article in August , we are doing a poll to find out what women in their 20s , 30s , 40s , 50s and 60s want to know about hair and makeup . Please respond by telling me your age bracket ( 20s , 30s , etc ) and a question you have about either hair styles or makeup application . You can message me or respond to this post . Thank you for your help !!! 
At 3:17 pm , little < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Knight came into the world - 7lb 6oz , 20\ long ... and I'm a proud aunt !! :) " 
So ... I'm already starting to plan < PROPFEMALE>'s 3rd birthday party ! Yes , she has discovered what a birthday is all about and tells everyone she meets that her birthday is in October , that she will be 3 , and that she will get presents and chocolate cake ! Her birthday is actually October 30 , and we want to do the party somewhere like Gymboree Music ... we did that for her 1st birthday . Any ideas anyone ?? :) 
< PROPFEMALE > took a bath in our jacuzzi tub yesterday for the first time . She now refers to it as the \swimming pool\ " and asks to go \ " swimming\ " constantly . I can hear the tub running now - Yury is giving in to her wishes . :) " 
So I ate 3/4 of a large pepperoni pizza at 4:30 pm today . Not even kidding . At 6:30 I ate Pad Thai and homemade cheesecake . Is that bad ?? 
Haha , leave it to talking about eating enormous amounts of food to announce a new pregnancy ! ;) Yes , we are expecting baby Rouba #2 next March ! :) 
So < PROPFEMALE > went on her first double date this morning ! She is at the zoo with her papa , her friend < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s papa ! I'm sure she is on cloud 9 ! 
Well , my friends , I'm a brunette now . I always have said that I would be blonde until I was 30 . And now that my 30th year is about to end , I decided to make the switch ! Here's to the rest of my life with my natural hair color ( well , we'll see ! ) !! haha I promise to post photos soon ! 
I am LOVING this weather !! 
So I went to the dentist today to get new Invisalign trays ... and since one tooth wouldn't cooperate , the Dr. decided to just cut the ligaments surrounding the tooth ! Well , thank you very much since I can't take ibuprofen since I'm pregnant ! The pain totally trumps the nausea today . :( And no , Tylenol doesn't cut it ! 
Let me just say that I am LOVING training 5 of my models for Miss Oklahoma USA - they are just amazing young ladies !! :) 
Why is it that I can never seem to beat my husband at chess ?? I was sooo close !! Grrr ... 
Tonght is the finals at Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > !! I can't wait to find out who is crowned ! Go Mrs. Oklahoma !! :)

Congratulations to the new Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > - < PROPFEMALE > Carbone from Connecticut ! Also , a BIG congratulations to our Mrs. Oklahoma - < PROPFEMALE > Baldwin Siler - on her incredible dance performance and winning best costume !! We love you and can't wait to welcome you home !! :) 
IT'S OFFICIAL !!!! Yury Rouba received his Green Card today !!!!!!!!! Waiting 11 years to be able to enjoy the freedoms we Americans have , my wonderful husband is now a free man !! 
Relief Society Meeting was fantastic tonight !! President Monson is such an inspired , amazing man ... I love the gospel of Jesus Christ and never tire of hearing about it !! 
So my last name is really supposed to be \Rovba\ " not Rouba . But Yury's passport got translated incorrecty and he just changed it for convenience . Now the Green Card says Rovba ! I much prefer Rovba ... should we switch ??? :) " 
So , at the zoo ... I asked < PROPFEMALE > what sound a monkey makes . She said , \no more monkeys jumpin on the bed ! \"" 
Conference weekend + 3-year-old daughter = 7/8 of conference missed . :(

\Often we don't realize that the trial is what enables us to reach the destination the Lord has in mind for us to go . Faith is an unspeakable gift . It is the indescribable promise . It sustains the soul through moments that otherwise would destroy us . \""

I'm not gonna lie - seeing photos of yourself in the Oklahoman while 6 1/2 mo pregnant working out at the gym with no makeup is pretty dang depressing ! I am really wishing I would not have given that mean photographer that gave me those bad angles my name to attach to the maternity fitness article !! 
So my neighbor showed up to my house today with butternut squash soup , bean soup and cornbread - ALL homemade !!! Doesn't get much better than that !! 
So last night Yury and I read the book Freakonomics and found ourselves a high education/high income name ! haha How do you like < PROPMALE > Rouba ?? 
I've been sewing for 8hrs non-stop ... this baby bedding better be the most adorable thing I've ever seen ! What a pain !!!! 
Flu , sinus infection & cold ... all in 3 days !! Cannot wait to give birth and get my immune system back !!! 
So Yury tried to get < PROPFEMALE > to say her evening prayer in Russian ... he would say something and instead of repeating it , she would translate it into English and say it ! lol 
So ... Yury's < PROPFIRST>'s Day flower order got messed up so they sent a replacement order . I just got both packages and now get to enjoy 4 dozen roses and 2 boxes of chocolates ! Yay !! :) 
Going to buy baby < PROPMALE > a new bed today with all the gift cards from my shower !! THANK YOU to everyone who contributed !! I'll post photos of his room when it's finished . :) YAY !! 
Eating lunch with < PROPFEMALE > . She looks over at me and says , \You're my best friend . I'm so proud of you ! \ " haha "
