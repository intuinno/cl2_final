Well soul searching and self preservation is a must . LOVE , HUMOR , EXCITEMENT , AND CARING are just a few of the things that being able to share with others makes life worth living and learning . But throughout that learning process we learn that almost nothing last forever ! Lonliness , sadness , pain , anger , resentment and all the other emotions arrive when situations get stagnant or stale . 
Will be moving in late august so if anyone knows any where there are any 2-3 bedroom houses no more than $875.00 a month please send info . desperation has kicked in and I dont want to just jump into a house or something I'm not really happy with . Show some love people . Private owners are definitely a plus , and hmpt or n.n is okay but preferably in hampton . Thanks in advance to all with help of any kind . 
I wish Heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you \ 
today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days \ 
before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All\ 
I have are memories & a picture in a frame . Your memory is a \ 
... keepsake , from which I'll never part . God has you in his arms , I have you in my heart . I miss you mom , josh , kayla , glen , and < PROPFEMALE > . 
We can not live a positive life with a negative mind , so when we come to the edge of all that we know , we MUST believe one of two things . Either there will be ground to stand on , or we will be given wings to FLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Need a lift anyone ?

The truth is , I get impatient . After persuing a dream for so long[with no success ] , I think it's over . But something inside of me tells me that God's heart aches to see me giving up so quickly . I know I have the God-given right to have confidence in the hopes of my heart . So if I really believe that God created me from the inside out then I have to trust that those passions will come . In His time and for His purpose ! 
Just one song can spark a moment , one smile begins a friendship , one handclasp lifts a soul , one laugh will conquer gloom . one step will start each journey , one hope will raise our spirits , one touch can show you care , one heart can know what's true , one life can make a difference . You see , it's up to you . Because what lies behind us and what lies before us , are < PROPFEMALE > matters compared to what lies within us ! 
Each player must accept the cards life deals . But once they are in hand , we must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game . Because dreams are renewable and no matter what our circumstances , condition , or age , there are still untapped possibilities within us and new ideas waiting to be born !
