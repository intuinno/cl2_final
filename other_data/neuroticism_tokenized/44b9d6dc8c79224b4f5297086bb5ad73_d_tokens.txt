Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes , I hope I have many more with my family and friends . ROLL TIDE !! 

Class ? When did Auburn get it ? Was is when your athletic director ( at the time < PROPFIRST > Housel ) goes on the radio and says he is coming for Alabama’s children , and compares Alabama to Hitler and the Nazi’s . There is no more class left in this rivalry . I am willing to bet that most of the Auburn fans on here requesting class from Alabama fans this year had a truck load of class for us last year . 
Nothing like a good old fashion bitter rivalry to get everyone worked up . 
Facebook . Helping family and friends fight since 2004 :) 
To all the classy Auburn fans , Congratulations on a great season . To the rest well ...
