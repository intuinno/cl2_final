' s got a ticket to riiiiiide . ~ < PROPFEMALE > Lefavi 
This world has lots to offer , but in time it will go dark . 
I will follow , I will listen . 
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . 
What God has put together , let no man put asunder . 
Today , I will speak for those who are voiceless . I will stand up for the unalienable right to Life . We have lived in a Culture of Death for far too long - 37 years ago today , it became legal for a mother to kill her unborn child . Please pray for the conversion of our country , that it may see the evils of taking the lives of the unborn . It's time to end the genocide of the weak . 
When I look back on this life that I've had , I want to see that I < PROPFEMALE > above the usual pattern and lived for the One who told me I matter . 
Optimism doesn't change the facts , just what you're gonna see . 
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind . 
in over my head 
Just one more day off ? Pwetty pwease , with a < PROPFEMALE > on top =)
