I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind/I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time 
You call me strong , you call me weak/But still your secrets I will keep/You took for granted all the times I never let you down/You stumbled in and bumped your head/If not for me then you'd be dead/I picked you up and put you back on solid ground 
Get yourself together/Let the light pour in/Pour yourself a hot bath , pour yourself a drink 
Appliances have gone beserk/I can not keep up/Treading on people's toes/Snot-nosed little punk

Everything in it's right place ... 
But you and I , we've been through that/And this is not our fate/So let us stop talking falsely now/The hour's getting late 
I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind/You could have done better , but I don’t mind/You just kinda wasted my precious time/But don’t think twice , it’s all right 
Everywhere you are/And in your mind/You were alone/All this time 
Journey on the mind . 
When life hands you a < PROPFIRST > , just rub the furry wall . 
Rise and shine , motherf***er !
