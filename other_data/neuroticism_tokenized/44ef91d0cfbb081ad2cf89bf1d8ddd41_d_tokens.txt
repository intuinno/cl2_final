Dad's in the hospital . His breathing is at 30 . Whatever that means , he can't breath . He's been taking maximum pregnizone for a week after not taking it for two years . It didn't do anything . He went through the emergency room , but his lungs/sinuses/head were all clear of infection and whatnot . If you think of it , please pray for him and for us . It might turn out to be a lonely thanksgiving .?

You need the danger just to feel your heart beat\ 
You need to die just to find your identity\ 
You need the knife just to know that you can bleed\ 
You need the pain now just to feel anything
