Sometimes you have to run away so you can see who will follow you , sometimes you have , to talk quieter to see who is listening , sometimes you have to step up in a fight to see who is by your side , sometimes you have to make a wrong decision to see who will fix it , & sometimes you have to let go of the one you love just to see if they love you enough to come back . 
he's her best friend . the one who makes her laugh when she doesn't feel like smiling . the one who makes her feel so secure when shes scared . & lets not forget the one she feel completely in love with & hearts ;
