It is this day that we hold dear to ones self , that comes to us not as a gift but a challenge , to look in the face of thy adversary and show no compassion . It is then we stand alone naked to the world . For it is not the days we live that matter , it’s th 
We must not live with regret ; for it is the actions that we’ve taken that have brought us here . Our history will lay the bricks for us to follow , for our past is inescapable .. History will repeat it’s self . People never change they only have lif

At some point we have all chosen the life we live . Every decision has gotten us here . Even when staring death in the face we still can make a choice ..... Take this as you will 
You can be a bad leader not by making bad decisions but by making no decision at all . A lack of decision is still a decision regardless if you think so or not .

the greatest enemy you will ever face in life is internal . 
some days we fall into the darkness of our egos and fulfill its most basic needs . we are all born with this dark passenger but some never let it see the light of day . 
And when I'm gone , just < PROPFEMALE > on , don't mourn\ 
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\ 
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling\ 
And I didn't feel a thing , So baby don't feel no pain\ 
Just smile back 
Love , love will keep us together \

Just stop , ' cause I really love you \ 
Stop , I been thinkin ' of you \ 
Look in my heart and let love keep us together 
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man\ 
To be the sad man behind blue eyes\ 
No one knows what it's like\ 
To be hated , to be fated to telling only lies\ 
But my dreams , they aren't as empty\ 
As my conscience seems to be\ 
I have hours , only lonely\ 
My love is vengeance that's never free

I must admit that's what I want to hear\ 
But that's just talk until you take me there oh\

Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there\

Where have all good men gone\ 
And where are all the gods ? \ 
Where’s the street-wise Hercules\ 
To fight the rising odds ? \ 
Isn’t there a white knight upon a fiery steed ? \ 
Late at night I toss and turn and dream of what I need\ 
I need a hero\ 
I’m holding out for a hero ‘til the end of the night\ 
He’s gotta be strong\ 
And he’s gotta be fast\ 
And he’s gotta be fresh from the fight 
just a piece . its the fire that burns within us all , lurking slithering waiting for that moment to whisper those words we crave . the pain and ecstasy that drives our primitive feelings to devourer our inner self . it is when you have felt your true passion that life seems to make sense and no sense at all 
Have you ever been close to tragedy\ 
Or been close to folks who have\ 
Have you ever felt a pain so powerful\ 
So heavy you collapseI've never had to knock on wood\ 
But I know someone who has\ 
Which makes me wonder if I could\ 
It makes me wonder if\ 
I've never had to knock on wood\ 
And I'm glad I haven't yet\ 
Because I'm sure it isn't good\ 
That's the impression that I get 
You'll have your looks , Your pretty face , And don't underestimate the importance of Body language , Ha ! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber\ 
They think a girl who gossips is a bore\ 
Yes , on land it's much preferred\ 
For ladies not to say a word\ 
And after all , dear\ 
What is idle prattle for ? 
You just slip out the back , Jack\ 
Make a new plan , Stan\ 
You don't need to be < PROPMALE > , Roy\

Just drop off the key , Lee\ 
And get yourself free

It's just one of them days\ 
That a girl goes through\ 
When i'm angry inside\ 
Don't wanna take it out on you\ 
Just one of them things\ 
Don't take it personal\ 
I just wanna be all alone\ 
And you think i treat you wrong 
I get so weak in the knees\ 
I can hardly speak\ 
I lose all control\ 
It's something comes over me\ 
In a daze , it is so amazing\ 
It's not a phase , I want you to stay with me\ 
By my side , I swallow my pride\ 
Your love is so sweet , it knocks me right off my feet\ 
Can't explain why your love just makes me weak 
I am thinking of you\ 
In my sleepless solitude tonight\ 
If it's wrong to love you\ 
Then my heart just won't let me be right\ 
' Cause I've drowned in you\ 
And I won't pull through\ 
Without you by my side\ 
I'd give my all to have\ 
Just one more night with you\ 
I'd risk my life to feel\ 
Your body next to mine\ 
' Cause I can't go on\ 
Living in the memory of our song\ 
I'd give my all for your love tonight 
It's driving me out of my mind \ 
That's why it's hard for me to find \ 
Can't get it outta my head \ 
Miss her , kiss her , love her , wrong move you're dead \ 
That girl is poison \ 
Never trust a big butt and smile \ 
That girl is poison poison

Hey now what you're doing down there\ 
Sitting alone every night while I live right above you\ 
I can hear your music playing all along my body's swaying\ 
One floor below me you don't even know me but I love you\ 
Oh my darling knock three times on the ceiling if you want me\ 
Hmm twice on the pipe if the answer is no\ 
Oh my sweetness means you meet me in the hallway\ 
Hmm twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show 
\Just because\ " just because you can doesn't mean you should ! just because its in your size doesn't mean you should wear it ! just because they did it doesn't mean you should do it ! just because the grass is greener on the other side doesn't mean they wont get weeds ! just because its your favorite color doesn't mean it belongs in your hair ! just because you can pierce it doesn't mean a hole should go there !

I'm broke but I'm happy\ 
I'm poor but I'm kind\ 
I'm short but I'm healthy , yeah\ 
I'm high but I'm grounded\ 
I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed\ 
I'm lost but I'm hopeful baby \ 
And what it all comes down to\ 
Is that everything's gonna be fine fine fine\ 
I've got one hand in my pocket\ 
And the other one is giving a high five 
I've been a bad bad girl \ 
I've been careless with a delicate man \ 
And it's a sad sad world \ 
When a girl will break a boy \ 
Just because she can \ 
Don't you tell me to deny it \ 
I've done wrong and I want to \ 
Suffer for my sins \ 
I've come to you ' cause I need \ 
Guidance to be true \ 
And I just don't know where I can begin 
She's a very kinky girl\ 
The kind you don't take home to mother\ 
She will never let your spirits down\ 
Once you get her off the street , ow girl\ 
She likes the boys in the band\ 
She says that I'm her all-time favorite\ 
When I make my move to her room it's the right time\

It's just another manic Monday\ 
I wish it was Sunday\ 
' Cause that's my funday\ 
An I-don't-have-to-run day\ 
It's just another manic Monday 
Its 4:48 AM made < PROPFIRST > breakfast and packed his lunch . Now to go back to sleep 
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall\ 
and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call\ 
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove\ 
for the first time in my life , I see I need love 
You're the one who makes me come running\ 
You're the sun who makes me shine\ 
When you're around I'm always laughing\ 
I want to make you mine\ 
I close my eyes And see you before me\ 
Think I would die If you were to ignore me\ 
A fool could see Just how much I adore you\ 
I get down on my knees I do anything for you\ 
I don't want anybody else\ 
When I think about you I touch myself\ 
Ooh I don't want anybody else\ 
Oh no , oh no , oh no 
harsher punishment for smaller crimes is a start . 
Today is going to be a great day , The sun is singing the birds are shining ....... wait thats not right 
El queso es vieja y mohosas 
Say you’ll share with me one love , one life time . Say the word and I will follow you . Share each day with me , each night , each morning . Say you love me . You know I do . Love me , that’s all I ask of you . Anywhere you go , let me go too . Love me , that’s all I ask of you . 
Once I was a boogie singer \ 
Playin ' in a Rock ' n Roll band \ 
I never had no problems \ 
Burnin ' down the one night stands \ 
And everything around me \ 
Got to start to feelin ' so low \ 
And I decided quickly \ 
To disco down and check out the show \ 
Yea they were dancin ' and singin ' and movin ' to the groovin ' \ 
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted \ 
Play that funky music white boy 
'' Ninja kick the damn rabbit '' 
Momma always said life is like a box of chocolates , you’re bound to run into some nuts 
Update ; Mentally dealing with my mother’s health issues , getting bit by a < PROPMALE > dog 3 times and only be able to wear dresses because I can’t bend down to put pants on really F-ing sucks 
It is our actions that define us in years to come . Let us remember those that took action and those that have fallen in action . Bravery is not to be without fear but to see fear and face it head on . It is in their greatness that brings me hope . 
When life hands you potatoes , make potato salad but when life hands you $h ! t , making a $h ! t salad doesn’t pan out that well . 
A traffic jam when you're already late A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break\

All I worship and adore \
