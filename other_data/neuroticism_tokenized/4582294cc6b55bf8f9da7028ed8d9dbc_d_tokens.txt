There's a rumble in the tumble ... 
So I saw Obama's address to the K-12 students today . I've got to say ... why the fuss ? 
' Gotta have fruit in the house . I like it as a snack . Wholesome , natural , chock-full of vitamins . I don't know let's see ... mangos ... four plums with red on the inside ... avocado ... ooo , just right ... and three plantains ought to do it . '

alphabetically filed 75 CD's into his case of already filed CD's ... it took awhile . So much moving from < PROPFEMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > , slot to slot ... 
Can I say that the campus hallways are NOT the place for longboards ? Are you really in that much of a rush ? Keep them to the outside world . 
... it's just so depressing . 
Phlegm and hunger . That's me . 
Oh , ' Heima ... '

Why do I always see Asians in nail care places ? ( If you think I am being racist , you know me not . ) I have wondered this for awhile now and have never been able to come up with an answer . 
Whenever I need life advice ... I check the Facebook status of my Facebook friends . Then I'm set . 
Prediction ( fact ): \Go\ " will be the best and most satisfying album of 2010 . " 
I have been pacified . In the wake of the Caspian cancellation , they have joined forced with Red Sparowes . That dismisses Arms and Sleepers , but Eluvium has joined the charts for the end of May . It has all come together . Brilliant .

There's a ringing in my ears ... 
Hey HEY ! Why did this screw up my lists ! This is not cool ... it was orderly before and now it's a jumbled MESS ... 
Thai food ... delicious ... making a grumble ... later , bad news . 
Last night : MONO at the Urban Lounge ... pretty much the greatest thing ever to witness this decade . All who were not there , be jealous . 
New Grails release out now . 
Last night : Beautiful sounds were emanating from Kilby Court courtesy of Eluvium . 
Listen . The reason why the light is not going green for you is because you passed the white line that indicates a STOPPING point . No , no , creeping forward slowly and passing the white line isn't going to make the light green either . Why don't you stop BEHIND the white line and stop screwing up the light synchronization ! Unforgivable ...

If you want to see something truly terrifying ... look up Turkey Twizlers .

I just want everyone to know how much I love < PROPMALE > and Hobbes . 
I love how everyone still cares about wins and losses of rival teams ... even when they don't play each other . 
Still very happy . 
No creative suggestion for Jónsi , just a straightforward fact that the song is perfect for the emotion \Go\ " already contains . Let's hear \ " Hoppipolla\ " as the cover ! " 
' Þe ' became ' ye ' became ' the . ' Way to go , English . 
' Don't that picture look < PROPFIRST >...' 
I haven't been on since to say that Jónsi was incredible . I still can't believe I was able to witness it , especially with fantastic company . :) 
New Mogwai album , ' Hardcore Will Never Die , But You Will ' set to be released February 14 , 2011 . In support of this release , they will also be touring , making a stop in Salt Lake City ( hallelujah ) at In the Venue on May 3rd . This is probably important news for ... very few , but it's good news . 
So much Post Rock ... not enough time to listen . 
What a dream I had : pressed in organdy , clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy , softer than the rain . 
Just downloaded the digital version of the ' Go Live ' album in anticipation for the arrival of the physical copy and the DVD . I'm happy . 
I needed a change . At least for a little while . For now , though , < PROPMALE > has discovered Durian . 
In ' N Out is just a burger place . 
Sorry , but I don't remember accepting the new profile layout . I don't like being forced into it . 
Probably should have gone with the cream cheese wantons ...
