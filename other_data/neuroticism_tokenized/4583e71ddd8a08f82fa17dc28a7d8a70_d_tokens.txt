Is it possble to just be happy for a day where nothing particularly good happened . Must be my week . I'll take what I can get :-) 
like a face on the water ... 
The Classic Crime :-)

SO FIRED UP ! I could go all day and night ...

Manic monday commence 
If you go about your life fearful of mistakes , then you're not really living . Embrace risk for a shot at greatness , happiness , love ... 
What's with this epidemic of wearing headphones while driving ? Seriously ... 
It's the people who try to be clever who never are ; the people who are clever never think of trying to be . 
Got this feeling that the next 4 hours are going to feel like the longest 4 hours of my life ...

Goin for a run ... 
12:36 
I've got the < PROPFEMALE > of a clock , \ 
and all we've got is time , \ 
I see no need to rush , \ 
head first into the end of the line , \ 
I'd have no regrets , \ 
and I'd not be yours , \ 
I'll take the days as they come , \ 
one by one , day and night , because sometimes it's better to wait ... 
Ever have a dream where it's great when you're in it and it crushes you when you realize it was just a dream ? Yeah , what a great way to start the weekend ... 
12:10 
Holding khef 
Tired of the run around . Risky business is this life ... 
ADTR on full blast all day long 
Things change so quickly ... not sure what to ever expect from people anymore . 
Why do commentators call football players , warriors , when they try to play after they get hurt ? They're football players . They're supposed to be tough . It's their job ... 
Tired as hell , eyes half open , and stuck in hartsdale ... Taconic should be a real treat 
Pretty sure my ipod was stolen ... awesome 
\The only man who makes no mistakes is the man who never does anything . \"" 
Good night ... But fail 
can't remember parts of last night ... Drinking = Done 
Sure I am this day we are masters of our fate , that the task which has been set before us is not above our strength ; that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance . As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win , victory will not be denied us .  
Failure tells you one thing : you're not good enough . Some how , some way , what you did , wasn't good enough . You shouldn't need more motivation than that .

Is it so much to ask that shell not break in a new cashier during the start of a rush hour commute ?

Loves painting outside , with wind gusts off the hudson , over a 45 foot drop , standing on a wooden plank tied basically to the roof . OSHA Approved 
Really wanna see Paranormal Activity 2 and It's Kind of a Funny Story ... 
new phone straight from < PROPFEMALE > ... sick 
I wonder how much the refs were getting paid to fuck the Eagles . Guess it wasn't enough . Haters fall back . E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES ! 
Be careful not to go fooling yourself . When reality eventually sets in and you find out the joke is on you , you won't be laughing . 
Avenged Sevenfold - Seize The Day 
There's not enough caffeine to make it happen today . Dead ... 
Sun glare bringing the taconic to a schreeching halt ... I'm pretty sure sun visors have been around for atleast a couple decades people . Use em .... 
Never rely on anyone to do something that you can do for yourself 
The League is definitely the funniest show that no one is talking about 
being mad is such a waste of time ... 
Drunk people talking about animal slaughter , vegeterianism , and evolution ... 
Time to hunker down and read some more Dark Tower : Wolves Of The Calla 
First time at the Shooting Range = Success 
E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES ! 
Just went to open the car door , when all off a sudden the locks engage ... Locked out of a running car . Awesome 
Honestly looking forward to the Yogi Bear movie . I miss being a kid and watching the classic cartoons early in the morning . 
Kinda wish I read the < PROPMALE > Potter series ... 
I don't understand the need for people to lie or exaggerate in arbitrary situations . What are the consequences of just telling the story for what it is when the story is basically irrelevant to begin with ? 
Thankful for my brother and father for all they've done to help me . And for friends , the year wasn't great but this year I got to spend it with all of u . thanks

Someone broke into my car ... But left their cell phone behind . Oops ! Someones gonna regret that one ... 
What a bizarre turn of events ... 
Live your life and let the chips fall where they may . 
Moment that made my day :\

Sergeant : Give me the ticket . \ 
Me : * Hands over ticket*\ 
Sergeant : Ok , see ya later . \ 
Me : Really ? \ 
Sergeant : Really . \ 
The goodbyes we speak and the goodbyes we hear are the goodbyes that tell us we're alive , after all . 
So amped right now ... feels like an 8ball of euphoria 
Woke up to my phone flashing some blue light and more importantly , the alarm NOT sounding . Officially Going to get to work an hour and a half late . Friday ! :-) 
Is using his brothers iPad right now and I have to say I am highly impressed . 
Flurries ... 
So often we get caught in the traps that we create ourselves with either , little idea of how to escape or too much pride to admit our mistakes . 
Fate , < PROPFEMALE > , ka ... I don't know what it is . Why things happen . Why they don't . But that's just the way it is . It's perfectly imperfect , this life we live . And it's fantastic . 
Not really in the mood to go home yet ... 
Changing profile pictures to animated characters appears to be an epidemic ... 
Feels like garbage ... Gonna be a long day 
Could be mad the morning sucked or can be happy that the afternoon definitely won't . I think I'd rather smile . 
Watchin Kick Ass with the bros 
sick ... 
8mm 
Aiming to read DT < PROPFEMALE > : Song of < PROPFEMALE > , start to finsh , by nightfall . The gauntlet has been laid down 
Half hour of sleep over the last 30+ . Think I'm down for the count ... 
Workin at the SPCA ...

Most people have 1,000 wishes for Christmas , a cancer patient only has one ; to get better . Copy this into your status in honor of someone who has died , is fighting cancer , or who has survived a battle with cancer . ? \ 
Today may seem long , tiring , and even hellish at times , but it's a day you're here . One of many to come . Never give up . 
DT VII : the beginning of the end 
has to go run errands . Unfortunately he just got home from work and sat down ... essentially a guarantee that no matter how important , nothing is getting done 
worst thing about being drunk ... trying to sleep when u have the spins . fuck 
just lost his mind ... 
no words can explain the last 2 days ... amazing . 
Dinner was great , now True Grit with the fellas 
talks of life with pops from might to 4am ... random and brilliant . pretty sure im not going to sleep now 
The Invention of Lying :-) 
Happy holidays folks 
Westchester officially under blizzard warning ... awesome . And by awesome , of course I mean \fuck snow \"." 
shits about to get real ... 
is pretty sure that the last hour and a half that I spent shoveling only reaffirms my utter disdain for snow ... 
The Fighter <3 ... The Warriors Code : download it 
2 leagues : 2 championships 
So every picture and song that I've kept over the last 5 years or so is about to be permanently lost ... :-( 
new years plans anybody ? 
be on your toes people ... check points out already 
Tried to rotate my tires and accidentally lifted the front end of my car up . I think the lug nuts are too tight ... 
pretty good night 
Strength does not come from physical capacity . It comes from an indomitable will .  - Ghandi 
Who's won the last 6 meetings between the Eagles and Giants ? Who actually made it into the playoffs ? Who WON the Division . Oh Giants fans , you already know . Just a little reminder while you bash the Eagles going into the off-season . Hurts doesn't it ? I'm sure it'll be OK in the end though . I mean , < PROPMALE > MANNING , is your QB . It's not like he had 32 turnovers this season or anything ... hehehe 
would love not to be awake right now , but he just slept 12 hours and that's just ridiculous ... 
Working in Manhattan until 10 . Hoping the snow holds out til midnight . 
Anyone in white plains or further south avoid taconic north . 
Shitty would be an improvement over the status of parts of the taconic north ... 
I wonder how many people planned to call out of work due weather and are now cursing the highway department for doing theirs 
Coolant pouring out of my car ... problems never seem to end 
Blue < PROPFIRST > 
I've never found words to hurt more than silence . Silence has the ability to say all the things that the spineless and spited alike , simply cannot find the mind to utter . 
... wow 
Pretty sure vomiting is the next course of action ... feeling like the weather 
Last minute preparation for the coldest weekend of my life ... I mean , YAY VERMONT ! :-D 
Getting the night started with some drank 
Sequence : Guinness , shot of hot sauce , iced twice .. All before 10:30 . This night can't possibly have a happy ending . 
Roads in yonkers already becoming a problem ... can't wait to shovel 2 driveways later ... 
Accident on the taconic ... 
Life is a series of events . Some good , some bad . How you handle those events , well , that's the true measure of ones self . 
Last minute packing for Atlantic City ... then engulfing myself in a level of irresponsibility unknown to man . Adamski/Doug Translation : FUCK YEAH I'M GOIN TO AC ! 
Would like to be obliterated at this moment 
Bummer ... 
Home . In debt . Cars totaled ? The definition of a true winner ... 
I wanna move down south ... 
\decoy muslims\ " lmao ... " 
has discovered THE trump card for the next road trip battle . 
thinks it's kind of funny hearing about states that don't typically get snow , freaking out over how to deal with something that we see as mostly just an annoyance in the Northeast . 
nauseous ; light headed ; FAIL . 
uninterested . 
< PROPFIRST > Rodgers has put the NFC on notice . Gonna be a rough go of it with him leading the pack for the next decade or so ...

ADTR , lifting , smiling . Night is complete . 
ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . Too many to mention have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends 
I'm not so sure what is real and what isn't real anymore . This feels like a dream . 
Right now , I kind of wish I was < PROPFIRST > White . 
Bright and early at the javits ... gotta get that money . 
Haters can come strong , but know you'll always leave disappointed . I have nothing to hide and that's why I prevail . 
Another day , another falling out . At this point I'm a fucking pro . 
I've come to a fork in the road and I know not which direction to take . 
The Adjustment Bureau 
60 minutes has kids telling stories about their families and being homeless due to the economy . We worry so much about worldly causes . What about OUR cause ? 
I think the real reason that I don't like New York anymore is because 80% of the people that inhabit this place are faker than a porn stars tits ... 
After watching Inside Job , I wonder what the ratio was of ideology to blindness to greed , in the minds of the individuals in the know and heads of these corporations . Everyone , even if you don't understand economics too well , should watch the film just to get a general idea as to the systematic ruin of a global economy . You might not care , but you should .
