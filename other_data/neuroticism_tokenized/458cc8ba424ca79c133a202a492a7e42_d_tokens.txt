I'm going to put myself to sleep bye playing my restarted < PROPFEMALE > Pokemon game . (:

Errg , today has been and will continue to be strange , starting my shower .... with a fricken HUGE cockraoch .... 
Court was hella st00pid , the end of Latin was hella st00pid ( and < PROPFIRST>'s gunna have green poop ) , and GSA is pretty lame . 
Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Fisher tonight . :D It's weird how things work out ? 
Tomorrow's gunna be a good day , < PROPFIRST > Booth , < PROPFEMALE > Jones , Marius Cholewa , and < PROPFIRST > . (: 
You're still the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning , nothing's changed . \/" 
I gotta clean my room before I go to < PROPFEMALE>'s house . D: 
Sometimes things don't work out the way you planned , or even hoped , but even if you can't control how they turn out you can always control how you feel and act afterwards ... Trying not to regret is always the hardest part . 
I don't know what I want right now , I'm being jerked all over the place with emotions , some of rage and others of complete sadness . I wanna crawl into a hole and be there ferr awhile , and when emerge I don't want you to cross my mind in the fashion you do now . 
Spending the night with < PROPFEMALE > . :D I love her . 
My back hurts . D: 
Last night was amazin ' :D 
My thumb hurts pretty bad right now , I like chewed a hole in it out of nervousness . XD Didn't even start feeling it till this morning though . 
Alright so my phone just broke and my parents aren't buying me a new one , how awesome . On top of everything else , this is my breaking point . 
This weekend man , weekends like this are going to kill me . When it was good it was GOOD and when it was bad is was BAD . I also have no more cell phone and my SP is missing . I don't even know how I'm gunna live through this week . D: 
< PROPFIRST > Booth , you need to rack a grammar book . 
GSA kids have more cool in their left thumb than < PROPMALE > Bourne has in his whole body . 
Would you say ignorance is bliss , < PROPFIRST > Booth ? Because you sure are happy for a retard . :D 
< PROPFIRST > Booth , wants to retake high school English till he's fifty . 
< PROPFIRST > Booth has on more than one occasion told me how much he loved < PROPFEMALE > and all the gingers of the world . He also thinks < PROPFEMALE > Peterson is hot . P.S. He thinks < PROPFEMALE>'s clam is really cool . :D 
I'm going to sleep now , thanks < PROPFIRST > ? Kindred for being there for me ; in the morning I shall start the healing process . 
Awake and hating it , but today will be better . (:

Early night sleep tonight . (: 
I only got one piece into the GSA juried show ... but in all fairness , only one was prepared for the show . \/" 
Also , my dad made fish jerky . 
Churchland high is soooo ghetto . That was a silly performance , and Bartley doesn't know how to dress for a show . XD 
Buss 36 , my stalker has been taken care of . The buss driver told the principle . XD 
My whole week was just made . (: 
mmmmmm , fish jerky . :D 
Sawyer Eason was G in his performance tonight ! (: Mommy's proud of you .

Zomg , now I have 4 < PROPMALE > show to go to this weekend . 
MY PHONE WORKS , MY PHONE WORKS , MY PHONE WORKS , oh yeah , AND MY PHONE WORKS . 
Gahh , I don't have anyone that can go with me to Hatteras memorial weekend . Frickkkkk . D:

Someone interesting really needs to walk into my life right about now . XD I need some new faces . 
So my throat hurts alot . I hate when I wake up to having an illness . D:

Tonight , GSA < PROPMALE > show with Kurra . (: Y'all should go , call me if you need directions ? 
The show was cool , I didn't win anything of course , only entered one piece , but it was fun . Also < PROPFIRST > should look more like his brother . :D 
So my st00pid plans were screwed for tomorrow , anyone wanna compensate for this ? :D 
It's funny how yerr to do list can turn into the coolest scribbles ever . :D 
I have to go to < PROPMALE > shows by myself today ... D: Sucks . 
I take one step forward , and two steps back just to find myself in the start of it all . Right back to were it hurts the most , to knowing it's self inflicted . I'll just continue to complain instead of applying effort . 
hahaha ; Talking to boyfranns of my recent past is always interesting . 
We never made memories , so how am I to remember you ? I'm just stuck with this idea that I miss you . 
My . TV . Doesn't . Work . St00pid mother , I told her not to unplug the Direct TV . 
Tomorrow's gunna be lame , so why don't I sleep through it by wasting half of my day tonight . :D 
The moment you lose respect . The moment he drops down from the high horse you put him on . The moment yerr set free from him because they're nothing left . 
I have a big to do list for today . (: 
I reeeeeally wanna become a cryptozoologist/ ancient astronaut theorist and study the past with my anthropology degree ! :D Gahhh , that would be soooo perfect . 
28 days later on G4 , ' bout to be chillin ' with < PROPFIRST > . (:

New hair . (: I'll post pictures after I dye it . 
Hmmm , stuff just happens so fast sometimes . 
So how ' bout I hate tap dancing . 
It's only official if Facebook knows . 
Sucks to have Verizon right now doesn't it ? Oh and look , I have AT&T . (: 
The Counting Crows concert was a complete disappointment , but I had a great time with Danneh anywayy . (: 
I'm always so , disoriented when I wake up in the morning . 
To do list : Take a nap , clean my house , shop , dye my hair . (: 
In the process of dyeing my hair , I also dyed : My legs , shirt , towel , and neck . |: 
By the way people , my hair isn't a wig ... XD

Off to work , then to Danneh's . Wooooo ~ 
Today has been pretty off the chain . 
Spent the day with grandma . (: I wove shopping . 
Ocean's Eleven kicks wayyyy more but than I thought it would . 
Gotta go to work at 7:45 , woke up at 6:00 , and hopefully I have some fun when I get back to the hizzle ... or else . 
Well , I have no idea what the heck just happened ... 
Must . hear . new . interesting . music . 
Mixed signals , oh mixed signals , why do I always feel like I'm playing a game ? 
Last night was soooo messed up , but I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and she made it all better . (:

Weeded four garden today , now I have one million mosquito bites . |: 
KID-CORE . 
Awake . |: Going shopping with my Grandma , then heading to Danneh's house for a chill session . (: 
Today was interesting . 
I . HATE . setting . up . computers . so . much . 
Why must everything be a statement ? Why must you call me out on everything ? Even if everything's a statement , why should we over analyze it ? Let people do what they wanna do regardless of what they may be saying by doing so . >_> 
Just being around you is always a lose , lose situation . 
It's bad now , but it always gets worst . 
I guess I'm no longer grounded ? 
I'm falling in love with Pinback . Plain and simple . 
Someone should come over and entertain me . (: 
< PROPFIRST > Kindred , that grill is still in my grandmother's car ... you should come over and help us get it outta there . XD 
Sometimes , I want to just copy someone else's status word for word just to see if they would notice ... 
In a terrible mood . 
I put on lipstick today . (: 
Sit's at COMPUTER DESK . Exits are SOUTH and WEST . STOMACH growling . FIGHT or FLEE ? 
I had fun today with Nurse Danneh . (: 
I MUST get the book The Salmon of Doubt : Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time by < PROPMALE > Adams . 
Abbas Yousefi , I really miss you . D: 
I might not be getting to sleep tonight ... 
Just . Cleaned . My . Whole . Room .... And closet . 
According to urban myth , the Daddy Long-Legs Spider ( Pholcus phalangioides ) is the most venomous spider in the world . This is false , as the venom this spider carries is far too limited to affect a human . (: 
Evolution does not claim that humans evolved from chimpanzees . Instead , it states that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor that lived about 5 to 8 million years ago . (: 
Most people are idiots . Good thing I got sooo much sleep last night , I have a loooong day ahead of me . 
The only thing I hate more than the idea of eating an quarter pound Angus burger with cheese is hearing and seeing someone eat one in a small , hot car next to me . |: 
Work till three . Shoot me . |: 
Work SUCKED , and now I'm gunna take a nap . Someone should hit me up ferr plans . 
Aye < PROPFEMALE > Scales , call me and tell me when yo ' punk tail's gunna be at my hizzle Tuesday . (: 
Jackmove effin ' rocks , and so does Danneh . (: Today was chill . 
I feel like crap . I've been feeling like crap all day . I need to stop feeling like crap . 
There should be a \fail\ " button right next to the \ " like\ " button on Facebook . " 
Uhhh , ironic . < PROPFIRST > Booth . Today . Everything . Ironic .
