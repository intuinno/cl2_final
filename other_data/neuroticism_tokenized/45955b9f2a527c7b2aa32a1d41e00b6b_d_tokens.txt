hopes the new year is a damn sight better than the old one 

If it's not one thing , it's your mother . 
is tired of being sick and sick of being tired . 
There's a saying that home is where the heart is . I may be back where I live here in California , but I had to leave home to do it . I want to go home . 
The new < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > apparently likes to wake people up by standing on their chest , and he is not a small < PROPFEMALE > . Ouch ! But he's so cute , I couldn't be grumpy at him . 
Kir Kir , the < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , has really been an indoor cat . That changed today . He's accustomed to a harness , so I get a light leash . He could explore safely . A little freaked by grass under his feet instead of carpet , but he got to like it pretty quickly . He's talking to me about his adventure outside now . 
I'm in the final stretch . A few things to get accomplished in the morning , and then I head north to the Bay Area . Pick < PROPFIRST > up from the airport Tuesday , and then a nice , long vacation spent with the best possible person to spend the time with . :D 
Ten wonderful days with < PROPFIRST > , but over far too soon . I need a lifetime of days with < PROPFIRST > in them . 
Ummm yeah ... Been so buried in artwork ( rebuilding my destroyed portfolio , working up some illustrations for an anthology , etc . ) that I kinda forget most of the time that this place even exists . And probably will go back to forgetting most of the time hereafter while I've got all this work to do . ;) 
I came across a shirt that I should probably own . It has \1 cat away from Crazy Cat Lady\ " emblazoned on the front . " 
10 days in Michigan with < PROPFIRST > . March can't get here fast enough ! Want March NAO ! 
Someone please send me back to Michigan . I got back to California tonight , and already ready to go back . It was a wonderful ten days with a wonderful and special man . I could use many more days like them .
