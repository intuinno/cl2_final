The airport has been closed because of bad weather , seems that I have to stay in airport for one night .

super hungry everyday ~ ~ 
Some people might take a step back and find out they were lookin at the same big picture all along . 
Depression Kills People ...

my real nightmares begin when i wake up 
too perfect to come true 
Everyday is a lovely day ... Whatever happened today , will disappear like water without leaving a trace . Everything gonna be new for me when I wake up again ... It is my wonderland and also my real nightmares ... From whom shall I get comfort ? I get comfort from myself ... 
“I often have both feelings—‘good’ and ‘bad’—about a certain thing or subject” ......... 
receive the real relaxedness when walking around campus at 4 o'clock in the morning 
hate my LEFT hand 
need to find a way to get out of the box , or I gonna create myself a bloody river .... 
always being stimulated by my daily painfulness , enjoyment and suffering coexist here ... I am still your dear little paranoia . 
we are out of natural connection little by little ... 
worthless educational systems just know how to pour useless knowledge on me . push me to learn or remember the things just for the tests , and probably would never ever used another time in my whole life . Reach the extremely aggressive point now . lose all my patiences . start to count my sleeping hrs , hope would have double-digit number during the 4 wks . 
??????????? ~ ~ 
push myself to sleep this morning ~ ~ and then wake up by a phone call at 12 
??????????????? “ ? ” ???????????????? “ ? ” ??????????????????????????????????????????? “ ?? ” ??????????????????????????????? 
kind of weird feeling when bike around 2am ..... feel like thousands < PROPMALE > away from the real world . hard to figure out , it is me that abandon the world , or it is the world that abandon me .... 
Probably it's for me time to quit now . I think I wont refuse people any more . Wanna stop this single life ... 
I would tell u I am perfectly fine even though tomorrow was my funeral ... 
watched the sunset and saw the sunrise .... 
catch up reading tonight , catch up sleep tomorrow night ... 
terrible terrible test .... get the last one at 9pm ... Damn it !

????????? “you are my sunshine , my fucking sunshine” ???... ???????... 
Having a hot-water shower . Playing some light music . Spaying my favorite perfume . Dancing circle around my lovely room . Hugging myself . Making faces in front of mirror . Smiling to my lazy fish . Saying hello to my sunflowers . Laying in my soft bed . Reading a history book . Having a little white wine . Hoping tomorrow is the the first day of my life ..... 
New camera really burns my money .... :(

feel like i gonna eat people today ... 
peoplel always put themselves into troubles , then try their best to escape form the troubles . They complain about that troubles always come to them , but actually it is them that ask for , bring troubles to themselves . Our attitude determines whether tomorrow is a good day . No one could let me down or do me wrong except myself ... PS , finally done with all mess tonight , good night and sweat dreams when i finally give up :) 
getting tired of explaining and expressing myself , I should leave since he is not good for my soul . However , it always fails . 
i know it is really bad to say such kind of words , but ... I was fucked by the useless education .

I am truly homesick >>> sick to home ..... 
Ego me 
Slow down my restlessness at long last by bleeding all over myself ... 7 hrs before the airplane takes off , I finally decide to pick up my luggages ( or probably after a short nap ... )

Suddenly realize there are some of friends that we only talked on facebook but not a single word in the real ... It feels weird O_o 
why people always wanna renew the systems but actually make things more complicated !! 
Seriously ?? I just run out of my < PROPFEMALE > about that ... WTF !!! 
most of time we leave our humanity behind rather than take it back ... 
Dealing with a mass of data all the night which is really frustrated ... but nothing could be more frustrated than receive your phone call . I apologize for trying to take my humanity back for you , which now I think is really stupid . 
?????????????? ~ ~ ??????????????????????????????????????????.... 
if you just roll everything up ... it gonna suck you for a while . Now , I am facing this wholly mess , and become totally speechless ... 
my brain just shut down by the 3 hrs physics lab , and also the lecture is really incomprehensible . Not because it is difficult , just sort of ridiculous since the teacher just talks about what is vector in this whole wk ... BTW my bike is stolen , which is an unacceptable thing for me .... ~ ~ o (>_<) o ~ ~ 
\Apologizing dose not always mean that you are wrong and the other person is right . It just means that you value your relationship more than your ego . \"" 
It is gonna be terrible if you are with someone who never lie to u but only tell the truth ... Nothing could be good if it went down to an extreme point . 
chill ~ ~ o (>_<) o ~ ~ freezing cold today !! I almost become a piece of walking ice on my way back from the library . 
that was a bad idea , I have to admit .... but things are going funny right now . So ... lets move on . 
A leopard can not change its spots .

Cold night :(

people were yelling and screaming outside in the street 2am in the morning making all kinds of noise , and I was cooking stewed chicken wings and sweet sago coconut soup in my apt with the Saw playing in my laptop . People choose their own way to be restless in this crazy odd cold raining night .

I can sleep only when I stop playing all the fancies in my brain . 
Need thousand splendid suns , when no one is by my side . Want to hug , at the splendid scene . 
Is it wrong that I didn't feel sick or scared but excited and amazed after watching Saw VII ? The bloody scene and flying organ and muscles are full of my mind right now . And I think the killing machines are surprisingly amazing . 
today would just be a library day , reading books for classes and Catcher In The Rye .

I could never tell what is right and what is wrong , but could only feel what is good and what is bad . He is thoughtful , sensitive , helpful and cute . It's good . I love him more than a friend . That's bad . 
??, Love Shone . 
I am serious . They gonna eat me tomorrow !!! 
I have been learning English for yrs , but it still takes me 5 secs to think about which is the one that I wanna say exactly when saying Tuesday and Thursday .

just pulled her facial muscles today . Whatever , it's a long day , nice day . Making < PROPFEMALE > bowls at the craft center this afternoon , super fun ! :D Then went Dixon and grab dinner with Jun Yuan . :]]] 
??,????????. 
You could always come and ask for comfort from me every time when you are lame , and I must be the one being kicked away when asking comfort from you . 
would much much rather go back to Nepal . I am serious . 
Home should be a place where you could be truly honest . A place you can eat , sleep , pray , read , write , paint , ML , laugh and cry . A place you can be tired , sad , peaceful , naughty , noisy , naked and pure . A place you can be everything and nothing . It only can be called home when meets all these conditions . However , it doesnt have to be a place sometime . So , its possible when I say Im going home but actually Im going to see someone . 
Lost at least 100ml blood last night . Slept at 4 then waked up at 8 this morning . Drank 3 bottles of water but still kept sweating . Changed 3 shirts so far . So .... Ignore the impatience and repugnance on my face when talking to me . 
Begging for a break . 
almost reach the end of this year . 
Love hot chocolate with cream on top , such a tender feel . :))) 
What happened these days probably could somehow show us how frustrated , irrational , and crazy we people could be , after a long period of economic recession and social turbulence , or if we could still be called people when reach that point . Seriously , that is not revolution . 
Eww ... Hey you ! Get out of my mind ! :((( 
I think it's the right time for me now . Two yrs is really far enough for me . I'm running out of < PROPFEMALE > .

Once you know something gained but lost can be regained once again , you are no longer scared of loosing anything as well as all the uncertainties lay ahead of you . 
she always stays up late for no reason . 
I am old now . No more work like today's! :((

??????????????? 
insomnia how could u annoy me so much :( 
Ewww ... No more ice cream on an empty stomach -_- ||| 
Truths usually hurt people more than lies do at the beginning , but it wont increase by time . Lies , just on the opposite . However , people adopt to tell/accept lies rather than truths due to the conflicts between sense and sensibility as well as dilemmas of cruel truths and white lies . In the end , the whole world addicts to be a drama , and people only attract to things that'll bring trauma . 
Today is my luck day ---> 1 forgot to close my refrigerator door again this morning ? 2 fell over when cross the street ? 3 ate ice cream on an empty stomach ? 4 talked to someone missed/love but ended up with pissed each other off ? 5 sneezed more than ten mins ago ? 6 messed up stuffs ? 7 TOTALLY FORGOT the conference . SHOOOT !!! Someone teach me ballroom dancing -_- ||| 
I won't be doing that again . LOL 
TODAY was cold , uncommon , attractive , excited , FUN nd AWESOME !!!! LOL 
Anyone interested in doing Campus Lighting Survey with me ( as Intern or just for comments) ? It will survey a section of campus at night to see if there is adequate lighting/broken lights on campus , so only during night time . 
If I could complain sth about my daily 3-hr lie-in-bed time to GOD , then LET IT BE 30-HR A DAY !!!!! 
You just don't know how much I LOVE the way you lie , dumping out your enormous ego before all , persuading what you never gonna believe in , vowing solemnly but all become vanishes into thin air .

\Assert yourself by making a strong judgment\ " ? I seldom judge people . \ " Criteria\ " ? Seldom people could get my idea . \ " Persuasive\ " ? Why do I need people to agree with me ? ---> Result : I can't do this assignment !!! " 
They would acquiesce in wars , fraud , racism , crisis , defaults etc all over the board expect legitimating abortion . Do they really believe that it could save our failed humanity and enhance the nonexistent human rights by protecting a single human cell/organic part and bringing another innocence into the messed world ?

Should leave the library temporarily and go for an early morning run . 
Eww ... Picking up my failed humanity when she was dropping tears and showing heart broken face in front of me is the worst decision I have ever made . See , what the heck I have done in my past 19 yrs ? No relationship , no chaos , no sex , no drug , no drunk time . College is a road with no return . How could I kill myself once again and go back to my former state at this point of time . :/ 
Ewww .... I should study for my business law final this morning but ended up with reading The Sun Also Rises . 
Aww .... Soooo many \spicy & hot\ " professors for next term . \

The current conditions of my brain operations --> 1 ) unproductive study for my Thursday accounting final 2 ) direct my physical body to the Food 3 ) being inspired by ArtKa's new Spring designs 4 ) sad about the reading materials I had this morning .

Anger can be good for soul . Somehow , in its own way . =) 
Sitting in a running bus with a group of random people is like traveling with a time machine . I hate myself always being caught up by weird , unspeakable feelings and emotions . Plenty of memories just suddenly rushed into my head at that moment . Then , I forget where I am , what I am doing here , how old I am , even who the heck I am .

Ecclesiastes 1:9 \What has been will be again 
The dirty , evil emotion rises again . Jealousy eats my soul ....

Passed by OSU Newman Center again and thought of < PROPFEMALE>'s bad joke that day when we were back from power walking/hiking .... \ 
Me : what is the Newman Center for ? It confuses me all the time . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Ohh .. it's for you to get a new man\ 
Me : Humm O__0 what that mean ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : ohh ~ ~ when you are tired of ur old man , you can go there and get a new man . LOL\ 
Me : wth ?? #$%$%#& -_- ||| 
?? :[ 
Laura : No wonder you dont have a boyfriend . You are giggling TOO MUCH !! \ 
Me : ( ? o ? ) #$%&#@ 
power walking around the town for 2 hrs , sea food and sushi ... finally a large ice mocha and hot water shower . Yum , yum , yum ... So COZY O (?_?) O ~ 
Late-owl is heading to bed now . Two finals in the morning =(( 
When she was smiling at me with the street lights glared down on her face .... That was one of the most beautiful moments in life . 
Finals are DONE ! Next school year job is DONE ! I am finally released ! 
creamy milk , stuffed clams with avocado toppings , baked spicy jumbo shrimps with butter ... umm , umm , yum ~ ~ @ 2:30 in the morning ~ O (?_?) O ~

And I just figured it out that growing up with your kids might be one of the most awesome thing in the world =P \ 
( LOL just by imagining that have a little me to be around everyday ) 
I actually feel more happy to give ppl a break-up gift rather than a marriage one ... Shame on me , shame on me . 
Steal it from < PROPFEMALE>'s tea bag quotes :\ 
For the emotional side of the brain , an examination of life is tragic . To the rationally thinking mind , it is comic . How then can ignorance be bliss ? Is it only certain sorts of ignorances that will result in happiness ? Is chosen \ignorance\ " less fulfilling than that which comes without travail ? " 
Hunhhh ... All those eye doctor things seem gonna last for a while :| 
umm ... where is my sunshine again =( 
FIREWORKS !! ^_^ 
Du Lam : \nice bumping into you this morning ...... I could have gotten kill if I stand in your path ... ><\" \

Dear Mr. Sickness , my love . I need break up with you now . 
Let she get the Legal Mexicans , then I can get to Alaska for the rest , one third laid back summer . 
watched the Open Sea and Deep Ocean tonight and then went back reading < Rat > . Such a beautiful book which keeps me from sleeping ^.^ \ 
I am being so satisfied now . < PROPFEMALE > you should read it someday . Sidenote : you still have my book , < Lover > 
Some nineteenth century women turned to sanitary parasitic tapeworms as a means to loss weight . But now we use more normal weight lose methods , like eating twenty pounds of bacon in a single sitting and subsisting solely on < PROPFEMALE > syrup mixed with cayenne pepper ! 
I should stop reading this parasite book and study for my law final tomorrow . But this is just way too interesting ! Parasitic protozoan which causes toxoplasmosis can make men have lower IQs , shorter attention spans ; women on the other hand become friendlier , more attractive , and more adventurous sexually . WTH ?? 
???????????????????????? 
\I'd really kill for like some avocado and banana fosters . \ " \

Got teary eyes when I heard what happened to her tonight . Leave work , profession and politics aside , she is one of the most beautiful , passionate , inspirational , educated and awesome women I have ever met in life . For those did this to her , they are spineless souls who are scared of changes , afraid of walls being torn down and jealous of the great soul she has . 
Did the professor just get hard during the lecture ??? \ 
-______________________- 
One important thing that I learned at the criminal justice class this afternoon is ... DO NOT marry someone who sleep walking !!! 
Swim , hot tub and sauna after work . A piece of baked garlic salmon for dinner . A pot of < PROPFEMALE > tea afterwards , lying on the couch of Interzone , listening to the local bank's Live , feeling the vibration coming from windows and walls , then all the surroundings start fading away , anxiety extincts , peace rises . That's the time when < PROPFEMALE > wants to leave . =P 
Thank everyone for coming the event tonight !!! Now it's < PROPFEMALE > tea and reading time =]

Michelle : \Let out OAs talke about the Dead Week Feast . \ " \ 
World is always so loud , too loud to let people hear themselves . People are always so brave , too brave to face who they truly are . And , I have gone so far , too far to turn back . But I never regret , to the choices I made , to the things I left behind , to the memories I abandoned , to the people I missed . \ 
I had those shadows flashing in the brain for days and nights . I saw Me and another Me . We were on a tall open stage , surrounded by < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > of people that I could recognize none of them . Then , I saw Me < PROPFEMALE > another Me , and they were smiling to each other . 
Less than 12 hrs sleep , more than 18 cups coffee for the past 5 days . Chaos after chaos . Fmy X___X
