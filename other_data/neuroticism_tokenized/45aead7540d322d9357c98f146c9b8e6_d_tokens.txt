steelers will win on Sunday regardless of what any has to say other wise

Thanks all 
thanks everybody 
life goes on , don't look back don't dwell in the past , live for today , live for the present 
Peace is something we want but will never have , war ..... war is the by product of that peace . hence peace is war , war will never end never stop , only continue for as long as we walk the earth . 
yes that was a deep statement but \i don't care\ " if you don't like it fuck you if you do your a philosophical thinker like me congratulations .... your human " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone 
to those who read my status that know me don't take it the wrong way this is just how i've always felt 
im going crazy , i don't know what to do the rejection is killing me , i can't keep it together losing my mind . some one help me

January 17th , foot surgery explanation and prep , surgery date yet to be decided 
the challenges you face in life make you the person you are today 
life is short , live it to the fullest . 
Why do people push me ? Do you want me to hate you ? Remember I'm incapable to hate . 
i will not break , i will not bend , i shall not falter , i shall not surrender , i will succeed ! 
life is a challenge , take full throttle and don't give up ! 
had to take off < PROPMALE>'s nail , he broke it to pad it was a struggle . 
work hard and for what ? barely enough to get by . a new job is on the horizon , time for some recognition . 
everyday i fight my inner demons , and everyday i win , but for how long can i keep this up . 
STEELERS ARE GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL AFTER WE BET THE JETS OR PATRIOTS 
we are going to destroy the jets , no < PROPMALE > in hell that they can win ! Steelers all the way ! 
well they will start with my right foot first , after about a week or more my left foot , then my pain will finally end so all together 2 weeks or more of recovery . 
been waiting 2 years for this much needed foot surgery , i can't wait for my pain to end . 
what should i do ? i need guidance . 
need to straighten my head out lost in the madness of the thought , dazed and confused , emotions running rampant , what else will ensue ? 
i am extremely bored , does any one want to < PROPFEMALE > out with me ? 
YOU AIN'T GOT SHIT ON US , SUPERBOWL HERE WE COME , GREEN BAY DOESN'T STAND A < PROPMALE > !!! 
i may be alone , but i have my friends 
Operation day , here goes nothing 
It is done 
ugh feel so helpless , it's frustrating but i'll live 
it's well worth the pain 
pain meds aren't working , i can feel the screw 
can't wait to start walking again , losing my mind and it's only been 2 days 
hmmmmmmmmmm , insanity is my only option 
learning to walk on it it feels so weird , rehab next week 
busy week , going insane what to do , any suggestions ? 
kill the non believers ! 
learning how to walk again , such a pain literally and figuratively , haven't left the house in almost 2 weeks going crazy what to do , some one txt me please . 
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!! the madness . walking with out crutches soon . on one so here goes nothing . 
so nice to get out of the house , went to the gym . long over due , but i feel better now .
