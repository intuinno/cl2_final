had a blast at High Altitude Camp ! 

is really wishing she was better at sight reading 
is soooo close to getting her license ! 
FINALLY HAS HER LICENSE !!! 
If you're a pirate , then I'm an orphan . 
is pretty sad school has started becasue she loves summer too much ! 
hmm ... now how am I going to get out of this mess ? 
Nothing like an 8 mile run to get the day going ... 
\ ... every so often we long to steal to the land of what might have been ... but that doesn't soften the ache we feel when reality sets back in ... \"" 
Homework .... is hard . 
WHoa ! Losing all this sleep can't be good for me ! 
is just realizing that what she thought was going to be a relaxing day is really just going to be a day filled with homework ... :( 
When in doubt , play out . 
GO TITAN XC !!! 
Life is like fighting a T-Rex . Its freaking hard ! 
I've found a new joy in life . It's called the dog park ! Its so fun . You can go and dog-watch . You know , like people watching except for this is with dogs . Its so much fun ! I love it . I might become a hobo and go there every day when i'm old and have nothing to do . :) 
Where the Wild Things Are is a strange movie ... I usually don't cry in movies but this one got me ! 
If only we could gain an hour of sleep on a weekly basis . Will someone please invent that and become < PROPMALE > ? I'D LOVE YOU FOREVER ! 
um ... well ... yeah . :) 
There's nothing quite like thinking you knew what you were doing and realizing you are doing it all wrong . 
Give it everything you've got- then give a little more . 
What separates a talented individual from a successful individual is a LOT OF HARD WORK . -S . < PROPMALE > 
I love my life ! I love it , I love it , I love it ! :D 
wow .... i really am strange , aren't I ? 
Dear Winter Break , \ 
Thanks for all the fun times , and thanks for Christmas , family , friends , and fun . Thanks for letting me sleep in and relax and also get a lot of things done . My only complaint about you is that you are not long enough . Farewell ! \
