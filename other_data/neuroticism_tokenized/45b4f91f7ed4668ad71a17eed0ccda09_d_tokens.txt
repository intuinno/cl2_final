And just like that , we lose by under a touchdown again . 
For seventeen years the fridge filled itself , and then the food walked out of it and cooked itself ( but that's something for some other time ) , what happened ? This is me nearly starving to death because there is no Milk in the fridge for my Cheerios . ( and while adding the links is unnecessary , it's fun ) . 
Monday : 90 degrees . \ 
Tuesday : 57 degrees . \ 
Wednesday : 91 degrees . \ 
Thursday : ... I'm starting to see a pattern . 
Wth , I thought it was supposed to be hot today ? Either weather people are big pranksters or they suck at predicting the weather . 
Prioritize < PROPMALE > ... 
< PROPFEMALE > on guys , 97 degrees tomorrow . 
So according to the IMPI ( International Melting Point Index ) , the melting point of chocolate is at 96.7 degrees Fahrenheit . My chocolates melted in my room . :( 
Why do textbooks/mathematicians insist on using the variable \t\ " in math ? Use another letter ! " 
So I bought the same shirt twice and didn't realize it until I was wearing the new one and saw the ( 3 week ) old one in my closet . And I left the trunk on of my car that's parked out on the street open for a little less than a day . I'm not an idiot , don't judge me ! 
Ahhh , first time I get to watch the San < PROPMALE > Chargers game since they lost to the Raiders . Let's make it a good one :) ...
