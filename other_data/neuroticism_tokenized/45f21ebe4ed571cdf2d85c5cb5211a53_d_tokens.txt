Pain pain , go away . Don't need you at all today ! 
A little more than 24 hours of summer vacation has passed , and now I'm flat out bored . 
That's what I like to see , Brazil 
I'm gonna be mad if some drunk driver crashed into a pole and made the power go out .

the post-workout feeling is the best 
It's hard to describe how I feel right now without sounding like a helpless emo kid :/ 
Are you freakin serious ? A boat crashed into the oil rig and started another leakage again . 
So if a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide , is that a hostage situation

This part of my life ... is called the beginning stages of realizing my dream 
Wild boys , wild boys , wild boys ...

So just how many hearts does < PROPFIRST > Mayor have ?? He mentioned at least a dozen halves in his song ...

The absence of pride is one's biggest killer

Cold , wet , miserable , and moving on to Districts . I love golf ... 
First night back to training ... and I'm a bit < PROPMALE > 
a Random Post .... 
I don't even know anymore ... 
The first step to living a little happier is just realizing that LIFE SUCKS 
This ain't cool ... 
So because I'm bored , I'll do it . Like this and I'll tell u the truth 
Yeah I really wouldn't have missed much if I didn't go to HC tonight ... 
I'd like to thank 3 fine gents for making my night tonight . You know who u are ...

Red Lion : we know drama 
Black's my favorite color ... 
Well tonight was certainly LOTS of good fun on good ol ' Facebook 
I hate little orange cats that feel the need to piss all over my bed

Forever , and ever , the scars will remain 
Rough night at training . Just gotta keep at it and I know I'll get better . 
I get a detention for the DUMBEST rule ever . Anyone wanna take a guess ?

They'll give river rock ( the bad kids ) in red lion a two hour delay , but not the school district itself ? Bullshit 
I guarantee you that whole first status thing is a joke . If it's not , then everybody posted the same thing ? Yea right 
He's climbing thru ya window , he's snachin ya people up , tryna rape em ' so y'all need to hide ya kids , hide ya wife , hide ya kids , hide ya wife , hide ya kids , hide ya wife\ 
And hide ya husband because they rapin everybody out there .. 
Now u gone done pissed me off !! 
I just woke up and realized we had a two hour delay . Back to bed 
when it feels like I'm being weighed down and it feels like my chair's going upward , is that a good thing ? 
The < PROPFEMALE > on < PROPFIRST>'s kinda f'd up , but kinda funny too 
Maybe not a win on paper , but a win in the team spirit . there'll definitely be a lot of stars given out tomorrow . Good job team ! 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : HOLD THE PERSON ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS , not the means they chose to utilize !!! Re-post if you agree ... I just ... did 
Good good night tonight with k-mart and < PROPFIRST > 
How bout Rate , hate , date 
I wanna graduate so bad , but I got so much to do before then ... 
Why have a 2 hr delay when you can have a 24 HOUR DELAY ? Hey , whadaya say , red lion ? 
That RUSHFIT program looks like it could contend with P90X .. 
U know how the weatherman's always wrong ? I hope he's wrong about tomorrow and there's a big flurry that closes school . that'd be alright 
There's no one who can do the 50-nugget challenge like the Red Lion Swim Team 
Man , do i need to end this ' last minute ' stuff ... 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > has a foot fetish ... LOL XD 
Religion isn't bad ; it's just the bad people who do bad things in the name of God 
Commencing the Haas Kitchen Invasion 
This is so cool : a snow day for once . I'm only happy because at least it didn't cancel the Southwestern Relays ... 
like for a truth 
so how many of us got on facebook today , signed off , signed back on , and repeated at least 20 times today ? 
Official Facebook warning to all RL School district students : two hour delay 
I've made the choice : I am now a < PROPMALE > Browns fan , even though football season for them is done 
Southwestern relays , what's up 
I like how in one day , that everybody's in a relationship now .

I love this weather . I wish it was like this all year 
Even the night feels great after a great night @ counties 
That's just me : I screw up everything good for myself . So smart ... 
Ten long years without the Intimidator . If only < PROPMALE > could be like him ... 
is it just me , or did this damn snow come outta NOWHERE ? 
i remember being told that when two ppl used to fight , they wound up shaking hands and becoming buddies ( somewhat ) . Now when u fight , both ppl still wind up hating each other while at the same time , being arrested and charged . like that changes anyone for the better ... 
so how many of us [ right now ] are on for the second , third , fourth or whatever time today ? 
I wanna JET MOTO motorbike !

Angry Birds : the best game ever ! 
I've had about enough of today . FUCK PEOPLE ! 
Great first night back to training . Thank god for Jiu-Jitsu ! 
I'm thinking tortilla chips for breakfast . I mean there IS some grain in it afterall ... 
We all need fulfillment ; excitement is only a temporary fix 
They said all US military personnel in Japan are accounted for . THANK GOD ! 
Man , anyone see footage of the tsunami in Japan ? That shits wicked . Thank god my bro's ok and accounted for ! 
Idiots are like people who can't climb trees : they could never be up on my level because I'm too good

How is it that most of the less physically gifted have more heart and will than most of the physically gifted people ? Interesting 
I just saw the greatest group name ever : PANTyRAID 
Stayed above 150 lbs for 3 weeks in a row ! Yes ! 
No prom date , but at least I'll be piling me up some money 
How does some calendar JUST run out ? Our calendar restarts each year , but some ancient and irrelevant culture made a calendar that was supposed to just end/run out !? If calendars are made to end , then cars don't run on gas 
I'll stay single and be happier than be with someone who'll try to control/manipulate me . Long gone is the innocence of relationships ; you psychos out there went out and ruined it for the rest of us . 
Got called off work . What now , bitches !

Out to eat . Out of the house . Finally ! 
Wow . The weather truly does have an effect on the way u feel . In this case , crappy 
If only things were different for me , but God gave me this situation to sort out for myself . This is gonna take more of me than I thought it would . 
Work til 1 then nothing . Hmu 
This wind better chill the fuck out . I wanna play some bball without having to shoot at a 90 degree < PROPFEMALE > 
Restless right now . Text me I guess 
let others waste their energy pushing u around ; they'll get too tired and stop

NOsama week !! 
Who's proud to be American right now ?? 
Even Allah couldn't save ur pathetic , uglier-than-sin ass 
So the NAVY SEALs killed Bin Laden ; that means there's officially nothing that the Marines have on The SEALs . GO NAVY ! 
Deadmau5 = the shit

024 : it sucks we can't do the grappling tourney now ; you could tie up almost anyone in a knot and wear pretty much anyone out . Beyond that , ur as good of a guy as you are a grappler . I'm glad we're training partners/friends 
I just took care of a stinkbug by myself . Nbd . I'd like to meet the people who brought them over , and shove a broom in their asses

Nothing's ever made me hate North Korea more than the first five minutes of Homefront 
In a month from now . Need I say more ? 
Either a new battery or a new phone . Ima have to go with the latter 
Weirdly enough , I'm feeling calm . Calm enough that it's making me wonder ... 
Working 7-2 tmmr . Then nothing . That's just more $$ for me 
Knowing you're in the last 30 minutes of your scheduled shift is a great feeling 
Amuse me folks , and like 4 a truth 
People thought 6/6/06 was gonna be a judgement day . Get a grip ; it's all a bunch of coincidences 
All those people want is for everyone to start believing in god again . They've done it before , and tied with biblical references , I'm sure . They've claimed end days several times , only to be proved wrong 
Armed services day : remember them all 
Let rapture begin ... ( I'm waiting ... ) 
Gotta love those stupid TV evangelists from California , telling us the same old song and dance that gets everybody up in a bunch . Use religion correctly for once , why don't ya 
Work it harder , make it better , do it faster , makes us stronger

So while a lot of you were at Mini-Thon , I was out working , having witnessed probably THE greatest thunderstorm in recent history . At least the greatest lightning 
Feels great to work out and eat great afterwards . Im definitely gonna make this a habit 
It was great to see all the red , white and blue yesterday ! Hope that didn't offend anybody ! 
9 hour sleep . Feels scary ; it's been too long I guess 
If freedom doesn't come free , then peace doesn't come peacefully 
If you wouldn't try to push down a solid brick wall , then you wouldn't argue with stupid people 
And thus begins the last weekend where I'll be back in high school on Monday . I can remember the beginning of the year like last week 
Mos Def goes hard 
I really wish people were more trustworthy anymore 
Y'all say \last week of school\ " . I get to say \ " last DAY of school EVER ! \ " Pumped as ever !! "

Holy shit ! a lotta people have birthdays today ! 
Old music and dubstep/house are where it's at .

The American flag does not fly because the wind moves past it . The American flag flies from the last breath of each military member who has died protecting it .

Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub : it is the hub's hole that makes the spoke useful . When mud < PROPMALE > turns into a shape of vessel : it is the space within which makes it useful . Make doors and windows for a room : it is the holes on the wall which makes doors and windows to be useful . Therefore benefit comes from what is there : But the true usefulness comes from what is not there . ( Lao Tsu - 6 BC ) 
Waking up to who you are , requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be 
Press \1\ " for English !? EXCUSE me ! " 
Love me or hate me , ur always having strong feelings for me either way :P 
It's kinda wild to think that someone , somewhere in this world , could be saying the EXACT SAME thing as you , right now 
Thanks to Google's artistic icons , I now know that today's the 450th anniversary of the St. < PROPMALE>'s Cathedral 
The only thing I should be focused on right now , is my job . Nothing else . 
Not a night sky more beautiful than tonight . Full moons are like no other 
Gym time , then whatever 
Life is like poker : you never win if you always fold out of fear of losing 
\What is this < PROPFIRST > MOUSE SHIT !? \ " One of the Best lines ever "

How God separates the good golfers from the great : a rainy , < PROPFEMALE > day on a British Open golf course 
It takes the hurting in our lives to become truly happy . 
In all my thoughts good and bad , I'm glad to be able to think that things will get better for me sometime . Ijdk when though ... oh well 
There's now a phone with a \Facebook Share\ " button . U know ur running a killer business when u have that " 
The thing that excites me , is what I will learn in the future . But enough for now , time for bed 
This really pisses me off ... 
Last half-hour of work ! Rockin'! 
I don't understand myself . I really don't . Oh well 
Damn , was it hot outside . Now to do nothing . I like it 
Depression is an emotion , not an illness . It makes you feel like everyone else , but you , is having a good time . Just as happiness makes u feel like anything is possible , depression makes you feel like there's no way out and nothing's possible . Emotions affect your body , but they are not illnesses . Thus , you should never treat emotions how you would with illnesses . Depression is an emotion , not an illness . 
Ya know , I never want to stay in bed past 11 . Well I'm deff feeling it now 
GTL time . Well actually just Gym . And laundry . 
Cmon power , I just rented Duke Nukem ! Don't do this to me now 
I love it when I beat nerds at CoD . They feel so worthless afterwards lol 
Truth is ... like it 
I got all these notifications right now . I feel so popular :D 
I actually woke up at 12 !? What have I become ? 
Now that I think about it : one of the coolest things ever , is when older men allow u to call them by their first name . 
Heavy lifting today ? I think so :D 
I really need to find something that truly motivates me again : A sport that I can really get on fire with 
I have a lotta blue ribbons in my collection . Does that mean I'm not a nice guy ? 
Now to catch some Zzz's 
Early to bed ? We'll see how that works lol

The Man with the < PROPFEMALE > Gun , never gets old 
Let's get a group of COMPLETELY fake people ( from tan to tone ) and watch them and their trendy asses act like total idiots ( which I'd still watch for laughs ) . You then have Jersey Shore ! Woohoo tee-shirt time !? Not so much . 
Urijah Faber is gonna be on Leverage ? I can't miss that episode for the world now ! 
so apparently Westboro is going to Norway to picket the funeral for the 80-some people who were killed . and in Norway , Westboro doesn't have the first amendment , which would mean they're not a protected group ! That effectively made my day , knowing that ! 
Less than 3 weeks til Cal U !? Damn summer flew 
Gonna go for a run . SEE-YA later ! 
Arizona green tea + [ Successfully made ] Velveeta < PROPMALE > and cheese = one killer meal + a happy stomach . Ah what an equation 
Being perfect feels like a way of life for me . And it's one that's impossible . Oh well ; I guess I always get as close as I can anyway 
30 NAVY SEALs and a pilot died in Afganistan from being shot down . 30 men who Became the greatest warriors in human history , and who wore the most prestigious Special Operations group's uniform . 30 men who were all one-of-a-kind . 30 men of men . Keep these 30 warriors in your thoughts and prayers .

Of course , I would be scheduled to work the last day I'm here ... oh well 
Ah laying in bed ( hearts ) jk . Never thought it would feel this good to just LAY down . Hope I'm not getting sick 
I may never need to have it happen , but what does it feel like to get ur wisdom teeth pulled ? 
Time to quit being a lazy ass . It's gym time ! 
These cats are driving me NUTS !! 
Full moons make my months ! 
they're actually gonna drop Chief Wahoo as the < PROPMALE > Indians ' mascot . And for Political Correctness , nonetheless . I swear ... >:( 
if there's something I'm happy about , it's a $300 paycheck , a nap in the near-future , and i finally got ooVoo working on my computer ! 
Maybe a nap is what I need . Sounds good ! 
Take another road to a hiding place , disappear without a trace , take another road to another time 
Momma comes home in about an hour ! Just in time to make me LUNCH :P 
Words with Friends , anyone ? 
Well I may be sucking at MLB right now , but at least I'm owning in Words with Friends ! So step right up : JHaas92 
Haven't felt this low in ages . Has to be the rainy , dreary weather ... 
Hopefully getting me a laptop today ! but definitely a haircut , finally ! i believe it's a good day !! 
This is the first Facebook status off my new LAPTOP !! :D 
Bedtime ! gym tmmr BIGtime ! This marks the second status to be shared from my new LAPTOP ! :D 
I honestly fear that \Rise of the Planet of the Apes\ " could actually happen . With the way people cling to animals and all . " 
Anonymous needs to be taken down . They're nothing but a bunch of no-joke cyber-terrorists . They can hack into NORAD and the Pentagon . Any rumor like that needs to be taken seriously !! And now , they're targeting Facebook . Idfts 
This lightning's making for a cool strobe light in my hallway ! 
Hooray for shit letters on Words w/ Friends -_- 
Good good day ! Now bball at 5 , i think 
Dubstep makes me go :D 
Well , I'd have to say that today was one of the finer days of my summer ! But that's enough for today ! Gym tmmr ! And perhaps packing for Cal ? Well i guess ha 
Only 5 more days ' til Cal U ... And I have yet to pack , 3 more work days ( hopefully ) , get an oil/tires change , and what ever other things I'm missing . This ought to be fun .. 
Man , i want some KFC right now . Never too early ! 
So I ultimately wind up working on my last day at home . Cooooool ... oh well :| 
And the Steelers-Ravens rivalry is already pissing me off ... GO BROWNS !! 
All I want is SLEEP right now >:( 
3 days left here . I'm nervous now . I don't get it ... 
My bed's getting more comfortable just as it's time to head off to work . Oh well 
Hooray for notification fucks !! 
Dude , that was cool . How turned that rumble on ? 
Ok it's all over now . Let's get a move-on , people 
Good day of basketball with < PROPFIRST > Cheezy Kraft , < PROPFIRST > Vanhart , < PROPFIRST > Cook , < PROPFIRST > Hook , < PROPMALE > Schaszberger , < PROPFIRST > Holloway , < PROPMALE > Scantling , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > Kitzmiller for what could be the last time in quite a while :| it's been fun , guys ! 
Well here it is : my final full day in York/Red Lion . Can't believe it's already here , but I have been luck to be around some truly great friends ( you all know who you are :) ) 
Last day of work for a while ! Rrockin !! 
Lizzy Haas is blowing up my notification box ! 
Best last day/week ever ! Perhaps the start of a change in philosophy : Live your days like they're your last . Because they were some of the finest days I've lived in a long , long time ! Shoulda lived high school like this , but college will be a different story . Count on it !! :D 
I'm gonna be listening to Bass N Drums x 3 all the way to Cal courtesy of < PROPFIRST > Neth and company ! 
York < PROPFEMALE>'s about to be in hindsight as we speak 
Truth ? Like it ! 
I might actually enjoy being in class MORE than these long , gay-ass orientation meetings . -_- 
Now it seems to me , some fine things\ 
Have been laid upon your table\ 
But you only want the ones that you can't get\ 
DES-PERADO ! 
definitely needs some getting used to for me , this college life 
I love how they have these \On this day in 2010\ " posts on the sidebar . Kinda cool to see ha " 
Hahahaha u fucktards that though Okami was gonna beat < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > were fucking stupid hahaha ! The spider's a true martial artist . Machida loves fat ones lol

< PROPFIRST > Neth and < PROPFIRST > Cook , here's a crazy status : BLOW IT OUT UR ASS ! 
< PROPFIRST > loves < PROPFEMALE > , and is glad he met me at cal so i can make him talk . (: 
A good rule of thumb : unless you can take shit from people or several people around you on the same side , don't ever tell anyone that ur a < PROPMALE > ( Indians , Browns , etc ) fan . YOU . WILL . NEVER . HEAR THE END OF IT 
Vegas Strip is SUCH A GOOD SHOW !! I love watching \cool\ " assholes get put in line by good men ( officers ) " 
\Speak softly 
TOSH TIME !!! Don't shut down the Fantasy Factory anytime soon , < PROPMALE > . Cuz ur show is REDICULOUSNESS compared to Tosh ! 
With orientation over , begins the first day of classes ! -_- oh well . has to happen i guess ha 
I will never watch the \Stuck like glue\ " music video again if I don't have to . So . Freakin . WEIRD AND CREEPY . " 
When the fuck did we get ice cream !? 
Damnit ! Why do they always take the hot ones ? Ha 
\A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a < PROPMALE > to get its pants on\ " - < PROPMALE > Churchill " 
Sticks and stones may break my bones , but Tomahawks will humiliate me 
Pray for < PROPMALE > Zigarski 
Just gotta give things some time ... I mean it'll all come I guess . 
I love reading what i said a year ago or who i became friends with on whatever day however long ago . 
why should it matter if someone has but a few pictures with red cups in them ? That doesn't always make them any worse than those who post nothing at all .... 
still feel like a champ from rock climbing ! 
My sense of adventure went thru the roof after today !! Can't wait to hit up the rush for dinner . and maybe a core workout later . And nothing like one class tmmr ! But it's Intro to Theatre -_- 
THe closest boxing place around here is 45 minutes from here . THIS . IS . BULLSHIT !!! 
Hooray for one-class days !! :D then meeting with my mentor 
\Do not pray for easy lives . Pray to be stronger men\ " -JFK " 
\Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace and those who could make a good peace would never have won the war . \ " - < PROPMALE > Churchill " 
Nothing like 3 hours of class in a row ... on a Friday -_- oh well 
GYM TIME !! 
There's nothing like knowing college ( now ) is the time & place to recreate myself ! Things will change for the best . COUNT ON IT ! Getting stronger , smarter , better . and most of all : expressing who I REALLY AM , damnit ! 
about ready to go out tonight ! got my runners on , JUST IN CASE ha 
shyness is a personality disorder . i swear ... :| 
Wanna hear a joke ? CalNet connection -_- 
ANyone trying to hit up the gym ? lemme know then 
Nothing like running up all the way to the stadium to get ur bag that u thought u left at the bus stop . It's safe though . And so am I . 
How would bicycle cops arrest you and take you in ? 
\Remember Lot's Wife ! \ " - < PROPMALE > 17:32 " 
Damn ! I really wanna try that Spartan Race thing . That looks hard , but i wanna prepare for it and eventually do one of those . LOOKS . AWESOME ! good challenge ha 
First ROTC lab on Tuesday ! Combat Water Survival Training !! PSYCHED !!! 
SO . BORING ! when the gym isn't open . Oh well ; it's labor day 
HAAS-tility 
Well I mean I WOULD like some sleep ... all I'm gonna say is that I better be up by 0500 when my alarm goes off ... 
1st ROTC lab : CWST . PSYCHED !!!! 
Gotta love people who must deliberately bang stuff around on the floor above you . And especially after you ask them nicely to keep it down ... 
51 ( counted ) push-ups in a minute and a half !? Gotta start somewhere , I guess . It's all about form anyway 
Nothing like being called a pushover .... No worries ; i'd push u over what u could handle anyway :) 
I feel for all u people getting hit hard with the rain back at home . Hope ur ALL hanging in there and not stalling/sinking ur cars ha . BUT really 
A Spartan lifestyle sounds good right about now ha . just need some SLEEP FIRST ... -_- 
i don't care if you say I haven't done a lot of stuff , that's NOTHING NEW ! Try to tell me something i don't know ; How's that ? 
Screw it . I'm sleeping now ha 
Hates sleeping issues ! Aleve PM should do it . if this doesn't get me sleeping , well ... lord help me ha 
And people wonder why i get angry . And i wonder why they get angry about it . Damn , this world makes sense ... not 
something's gotta give . SERIOUSLY ! 
I LOVE SALT ! that COULD explain my salty personality ha 
10 years ago : NEVER . FORGET ! Perhaps the reason alone that I may go active duty 
i don't see how people are content to stay home and go to college if they have the choice . I mean maybe some other things stop them from going abroad , but really ... idk but I LOVE COLLEGE ! 
< PROPFIRST > Espana Vreeland , you are NOT my daddy ! \ 
... BITCH ! 
Well bring on the annoying Steelers-Ravens post/arguments . Just don't forget what today is . Trust me : it's more important than your stupid rivalry 
Sleeping or reading ? Sleeping , or reading ?? Reading it is , but what's the difference ? ha 
Damn . I wish books read themselves ... oh well 
ya know what hasn't changed after ten years : we still have what it takes to turn our enemy into a nice little crater ! :) 
so exactly two years ago , I officially had a concussion . good times lol 
Bring on the cool fall weather . cuz I've been waiting all year for it ! 
I get so motivated when i CAN'T workout , but then i lose it all come around the time when i CAN ! -_- HATE THAT ! 
How does Intro to the Theatre tie in with my < PROPMALE > ? Guess i'd have to take it eventually ... still . It's DUMB 
My fatigue is what's keeping me down . It's nap time ; idc if I can't sleep later ha 
How can I sleep over an alarm clock ?? For lab ... >:( way to go , < PROPFIRST > 
Don't spit the truth , speak it ! Because everyone tends to just walk over spit ; they can't escape words 
Mimes are COOL ! 
Wow . Might as well not sleep at all . so i can stay awake for the important things . Sleep's for the dead anyway , right ? ha 
To do basic over the summer ... or to not do basic over the summer ? Extra money , or extra freedom ? Decisions , decisions , decisions ... 
Done for the day ! Landmark training at 5 
Labs are the best dogs ever . Period :) 
Well I couldn't feel anymore like an IDIOT right now ... 
55 pushups , 58/59 ? Situps , and a 14-minute 2-mile run . Definitely room for improvement . Not bad , but not good enough . \ 
#Motivation 
My names < PROPFIRST > and i'm awesome ! < PROPFIRST > Bardo is my best friend ! Peace out ! 
It always happens to me ... welp , Just my luck , that's all 
I'm in no mood to deal with people dumber than the damn walls . Like can anyone explain what it's like to be THAT DAMN STUPID ? Cuz i wanna know how anyone can live with themselves like that . But finding that answer would probably take too much for their small heads to digest in itself . 
I miss my dog ! >:\\ 
wish i had a stronger sense of detachment ... 
80% on my first college quiz : not TOO bad , i guess 
really wants to go to basic training this summer ! It really needs to happen for me . 
High school/college drama : WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ? -_- 
So who REALLY knows why the sky's blue ?? 
Y'all may laugh at my hope , but ... GO BROWNS !! 
Thats how ya do it , < PROPMALE > !!!! 
I definitely want to go to basic this summer . idc that it means my summer , and that's how i wanna spend it as of late . 
Omg < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! Ur an animal !!! And Steve-o more so haha . That was the best roast ever 
Did you get drug tested today ? Thank you Florida , Kentucky , and Missouri , which are the first states that will require drug testing when applying for welfare . Some people are crying and calling this unconstitutional . How is this unconstitutional ? It’s OK to drug test people who work for their money but not those who don’t ? Re-post this if you’d like to see this done in all 50 states !!! 
I would love to get a grasp/hold into the minds of some people . and JUST understand why they are who they are . It would just be ... interesting . Like me ha :) 
I had/have things I need to talk about . But no one to talk about it with ... 
MMM California Roll = :D

Place the elderly in prisons . They will get a shower a day video surveillance in case of problems , three meals a day , access to a library , computer , TV , gym ... Put criminals in nursing homes . They have cold meals lights off at 20h , one bath a week , live in a smaller room and pay 4,000 a month !!!!! It's Pretty darn sad that we treat prisoners better than the elderly !!!! Copy and paste if you agree 
Nothing like R . E . M . ' s music to pick me up !! 
HEY California Borough PD , why don't u get to work on cracking down on all the shootings instead of worrying about dealing out underages , tire boots , and parking tickets ? Sounds good ? Cal U does

Red Bull may just be my new pre-workout drink . I feel amazing right now ha 
might as well go for another 4-mile run tmmr . the only way to get to the top , is up 
Again I say : something's gotta give . Just something 
the most intruding thoughts that come across are always ones of things that you can't control 
Gotta love people who display minimal self-respect . I WILL treat you like shit , if you treat yourself like shit . End of story 
all this poison on my body's really pissing me off ! 
for how far I've already gotten , I can't afford to look back now . Only forward leads to the growth I seek . But that's enough for today . Goodnight ! 
nothing like getting an e-mail from a prof saying your class is cancelled for the day ! Free after 11am . HMU 
It's looking like some reading for me right now ... after my noodles , of course hah
