I am a aunt -- again !!! My twin has had her 2nd child !!! 

I feel there is this evil , negative funk that keeps pulling me down . Everything pushes my buttons and I am so angry . NEED PRAYER !! NEED TO BE UPLIFTED !! 
Feeling great !! 11/8- celebrated 6 years of marriage and 11/10- celebrated my husband's 30th bday . 
Congrats to Alabama fans and WAR EAGLE !!!! 
Had a ball at < PROPMALE > The Entertainer's show yesterday . Feels good to go out again . Laughed our butts off . 
Thank you GOD for what you have done , what you are doing , and what you are planning to do . Help me to stay in YOUR WILL ! 
Life is what happens when you are too busy planning for other things . 
Counting my blessing -- I am thankful I was able to get up this morning . No matter if the day was good or bad , I am glad I was able to get up . Thank you Lord . 
Today I was at the point of cursing out loud --- I had cursed so much in my head that it was about to spill out and come right out of my mouth- 
Today I witnessed the first camouflage evening gown in a pagent . Must I say more ... 
Enjoyed sleeping in and enjoying the day the way I wanted to . 
I wish there was a magic button that only grown woman could push to stop time so they could do things without losing time within the regular day -- things like -- shopping , getting massages , getting alllll of my work caught up , cleaning up my house the way I really want it , sleeping without being interruptions , etc ... 
We went to the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Show on yesterday and everyone laughed , was BLESSED with words from the Bible , and encouraged with words from < PROPFIRST > .......... and then we -- blacks and whites --- lost our blessings in the parking lot because we became ignorant because we are not patient when 9000 people try to leave 
Relaxing with family and getting ready for the Easter Weekend celebration . Thank GOD for JESUS . 
Enjoying the Final NCAA bball game . This is the best sport ever !!!! 
Just 32 student days of school left and 34 of teachers days . Can't wait till it is all over . Need another break before school is out . 
FYI- The Disney Store in the Galleria is going out of business . All items are on sale . 50-80% off of items . 
I often wonder if I knew that my body would be as painful after playing sports for nearly 14 years , would I have still chosen to play ball . My body feels like it is going on 78 years old . 
>>> Just nine more days of the lovely babies and eleven more of the school moms . \ 
Can't wait til its all over !!!!!!!!!!!! 
>> Had a wonderful time with < PROPFIRST > and Jayden bowling . Just some time with family makes everything seem better . 
--- Our Disney Cruise was a blast !!! Jayden had a ball -- Mom , Dad , and < PROPFEMALE > truly enjoyed the shows , the Bahamas , and Disney's Private Island . Must do again !!! 
More pics to come from the cruise ... 
Happy Father's Day to all Dad in the world . Good and bad . 
My husband had the best and worst Father's Day . He got a new grill and later his XBOX died . He is going to be depressed for awhile . 
< PROPFIRST > Brown's return through < PROPFIRST > !! Unbelievable ! 
Had a long interesting conversation with my husband tonight . Lots of these to come since there is no XBOX . **** Women- appreciate the XBOX -- just kidding , I love talking with my husband . It is the main ingredient in our marriage --- communication . Thank you LORD ! 
Keys to a perfect marriage :\ 
1 . GOD has to be the head of the marriage\ 
2 . Financial stability\ 
3 . Balanced and faithful sex life with your spouse \ 
4 . Communication \ 
\ 
Lack in one area gives you a challenge but it can be saved if you truly want it . 
>> A day of family , food , and funny movies . Happy Bday < PROPFEMALE > . May GOD heal and restore this country to where it needs to be . 
... 1 hour and I will be 35 years old . GOD is good !! Thank you . 
Happy B'day to Nieshal , Quitta , < PROPFEMALE > Smoot , and me !!! 
Nails and toes done , hair done , and shopping done . \ 
Next- body massage , dinner , and a movie . 
Day 2 of the new XBOX -- husband has overdosed on the game . Yesterday he played nearly 5 hours straight . 
God has seen you struggling with something . God \ 
says that's over . A blessing is coming your way . If you believe in God , \ 
repost this ! Please don't ignore this , you are being tested . For it says\ 
in the Bible , \Deny me in front of everyone 
Had a great with my sorors !!! NO Chapter of 94 , 95 , and 96 . \ 
GOD has truly blessed all of us . 
Got the \I don't feel well blues\ " and I need lots of rest but having trouble sleeping . " 
Medicine got me wired !!!! I can't sleep and I need the rest !!! 
Had a great Saturday and Sunday with JD- We went to the Fair in Pelham-cotton < PROPFEMALE > , funnel cake , < PROPFEMALE > apples , and more ... 
OMG !!! My husband was told that he has a pitch nerve in his neck that has caused his arm and leg to have a weird tingling sensation . All of this started on Saturday . His doctor asked him if he was stressed from work . He said no , and then replied that the most stressful thing he deals with is watching college football on Saturdays !!!! 
If I had the opportunity , I would go to Law School and pursue my true dream . 
WAR EAGLE !!! Too close to comfort , but we won !!! \ 
To my husband and all UA Fans , you got the next one . What you do after your first lost makes the difference . 
Hey how are you . I have had you on my mind all week . 
I think there needs to be a new survivor show . It should say : SURVIVOR- The Education Version- what educator will be the last one standing ? 
No matter what situation you are in , GOD can fix it and/or make it better than it is . Your faith determines that . 
GO WAR EAGLES !!!! \ 
Okay , for my husband and all UA fans- your next win is coming within the next few hours . Go Alabama Teams !!! 
Congrats to the best state teams !!! War Eagle \ 
Congrats to my husband and all < PROPMALE > fans . You have truly redeemed yourself . 
Although it was on my mind , I went a whole day without during school work . \ 
I am on my way to recovery of the \ I am overwhelmed by my job\ " blues . \ 
Happy Anniversary --- < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Hayes --- 7 years of a Happy and Blessed Marriage\ 
Spent yesterday and all day today with my best friend -- < PROPFIRST > --- 9 1/2 years as my best and true friend . ( Always by my side ) Thank you GOD for this great man . 
Can't wait for day two with my husband . Celebrating our anniversary ( Nov . 8 ) and his upcoming birthday ( Nov . 10 ) This traditional committment to set aside time and money to celebrate one another is soooooo worth it . 
Jayden had his 1st bball practice tonight . He was so cute . Pictures will follow soon . 
This is a time for restoration . GOD will restore his people in a time of a storm or recession . Go forth and pursue the desires of your heart in every direction of your life . I receive it and ask GOD to guide my steps and my words through this time . 
WAR EAGLE !!!!

Official message from the school system that < PROPMALE > County Schools are cancelled for Monday . 
I have felt aweful all day and it is not getting any better . 
Feeling better but still lacking lots of energy . 
< PROPMALE > County School will open 2 hrs later . School starts at 10 am and employees report at 9 am . 
Soup , salad , and bread sticks sound & smell good to me . < PROPFEMALE > Garden I need you . 
Today I had to joy of witnessing my older brother's baptism . \ 
He has always believed in GOD , attended church occasionally , and prays often . \ 
Our previous church did not do baptism but sprinkled you with water . I am so glad that our entire family now has been submerged into the water like JESUS . May GOD receive the < PROPFEMALE > for this great day . 
My son got an early b'day present for his Saint < PROPFIRST>'s Bday ---- he wished for a little brother and today the ultrasound confirmed just that --- we are having a boy . 
Off for spring break and still can't get any rest . 
Went to the park to shoot basketball with my husband and son . 35 yrs old , pregnant , and I still got my bball skills . 
Brought new bedspread and decorations for Jayden's new room so we can slowly transition Jayden's old room for Kendyl ( 4 months before he is here ) .
