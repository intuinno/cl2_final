to all packer fans : be sure to thank the refs on your way out cause dang , rogers had an extra 5-10 secs routinely , credit to him for taking advantage but come on , add to that the fact that the refs refused to call pass interference on two plays maybe 3 , like < PROPMALE>'s second int you were handed that game , still would pick the pack over any other NFC team 
seriously fergie needs to be black listed for all national anthem deals , not only was she messing with the song NOT singing it the way it's supposed to be < PROPFIRST > , she can't even be bothered enough to remember the words

need music to lose myself in ... why did i have to lose my ipod ? 
bowling with my younger cousin and family 
sitting with my comfort food ( < PROPFEMALE > kats ) and dragon age 2 , that's all i have right now ... having < PROPFEMALE > Pulford withdrawals 
so ... tired ... 
watching castle ; two cops are getting tortured for information . one of the cops is being forced to watch his partner being waterboarded , ' Alright ! I'll tell you!' ' Good , how much do they ( the cops ) know about me ? ' ' The cops know everything ... they know ... about me and your mom '
