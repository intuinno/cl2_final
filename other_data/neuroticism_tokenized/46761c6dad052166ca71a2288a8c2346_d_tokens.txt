Happy New Year , everyone ! Hope it's the awesomest one yet !

just received the gift of Kool-Aid in the mail . How awesome is that ? 
Happy 4th , everyone . 
is preparing for cocktail hour . >.> 
wonders why automatic updates seem to cause software to spontaneously combust . 
Things I learned today : 1 . Oversized bonfire + hot , dry GA summer + unusually strong wind = RUN . 2 . Just because a stick looks like it isn't on fire does not mean it cannot spontaneously become so in your hand . 3 . Fire can be mown to death . 
is glad to be done with finals . 
That movie was on CRACK .

\Say ' Auf Wiedersehen ' to your Nazi balls . \"" 
needs to pick up some new music whenever he's next in town . Or , you know , figure out some more music he likes , and then pick it up . 
* pulls out shotgun , but thanks considerate zombie for warning the deaf * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQYjZc7gKXc 
Surrogates . Woah , depressing . And I don't like the implications it made about how to treat people who suffer from past trauma . Good movie , nonetheless . 
worships Tallahasse and < PROPMALE > Armstrong , gods of zombie-killing and survival horror . 
is impatient for the weekend to be here . >.< 
? Behold the glorious spread of communism ! Unite , my brothers ! ? 
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS ! ” 
\Insomnia\ " is officially my least favorite word in the English language . >.<"

Classes are over ! Coma powers , activate !

... when did Facebook start showing when your friends comment on people you don't know's pages ? I keep forgetting if these random people are friends I've forgotten I have , or if I've just never met them . \ 
... not that that keeps me from commenting either way , I'm just saying . >.> 
Don't you just love waking up on an energy kick ? * rocks out * 
awaits the arockalypse ! \\m/ >.< \\m/ 
Shamelessly stolen from < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , ' cause I'm bored and curious and that's the worst combination ever . \ 
\ 
\POKE ME if you ever had a crush on me . LIKE this status if you think I'm a good friend . MSG me if you ever wanted a relationship with me . COMMENT on this status if we have had good memories . Now lets see whos brave enough to copy and paste this on their status . :D \"" 
is getting to the choppa ! I swear ! 
has a new pet peeve : people who drive 30mph below the speed limit in the fast < PROPFIRST > . Especially in a place where people usually go the same above in the slow < PROPFIRST > . >.< 
NO ONE can handle The Truth ! >.> 
You idiot ! There are weapons on the choppa ! 
... how can my computr be in a different time zone from itself ? And then ALSO be in the same time zone as itself at the same time ? 
is back from SDCC . Best trip EVER . 
is spending too much time looking at artwork . \ 
Also , a thought occurred to me . While B&W photography has a nice effect to it , sometimes , it just seems like it's overdone . It just seems like sometimes , the entire focus of the piece is lost . \ 
But then , I'm crazy , so what do I know ? >.> 
is fighting a war against his eyes . And losing . >.> 
just saw the most ridiculous ... motorcycle ? I'm not really sure if that's what you'd call it ... 
returned to his apartment after class and was greeted by a smell somewhere between horseradish and burnt . The only comclusion is that one of my roommates also cannot cook . That , or some dish out there calls for disgusting quantities of burnt horseradish , which ... sounds nauseating . 
GOD DAMN IT , FACEBOOK . 
is caught in a Facebook time warp . O_O 
Facebook news feed is now mass-linking me the same event . 37 x lightsabers and 43 x < PROPFEMALE > Fox . Stop taking drugs , Facebook . 
sometimes hates how strange status updates look if the first sentence isn't written subjectless and in 3rd person . 
Machete tomorrow . Yes ? 
can't fall asleep because he is too incredibly pissed off . * sighs * 
Procrastination is not the < PROPMALE > of putting off for tomorrow what could be done today . It is the < PROPMALE > of getting mad at yourself when you didn't do it then , either . =P 
has been so easily pissed off lately . I need to stop getting angry about such stupid things . 
hates that feeling . The one where everyone hates you . 
Oh , FB . Just once I'd like to get on you without you flipping out and going crazy . 
wishes everyone the best . Be well , guys . 
thinks that every day is a good day when you're not on fire . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone . =) \ 
... shush , I know I'm a little late , but still . Be well . =P 
Facebook shows you random pictures of pretty people you know in the sidebar ? When did they add that ? o_o \ 
... not that I'm complaining or anything , just saying . >.> 
What's the word for that feeling that you've done something before when you're staring at proof that you never did ? 
Today is apparently National Have a Bad Day Day . Makes me a little nervous . >.> 
Guy next to me is talking to himself while playing a Facebook game . Whichever the one with the cafes is . It's kiiiinda intense . o_o 
can't keep his head straight . Who are you people again ? >.> 
' s status updates aren't literal . You people ... =P 
never realized how much the sight of a car wearing fake eyelashes would stick with him . 
enjoys flirting with people who , sadly , will never take him up . Ah , well . =3 
drove home under a sunset-red sky at 1 in the morning , then jumped in the shower to face an overpowering stench of fresh blood in the water . I understand what caused both of them ... but it still feels a bit ominous . 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day / Death Metal Day , everybody ! 
I salute you , Badass Fish . 
Had an awesome day . The end . =)

Make this your status , see if your brave enough :) \ 
I stole this from a cat . Seems vaguely immoral somehow . >.> 
Thoughts for the day :\ 
Sleeping while appearing to read a textbook is the most valuble skill you can learn in college . \ 
Ever since I was that ICP SNL parody , when I pass a conspicuously short person , I am tempted to ask them if they're just far away . >.> \ 
Liking your own post on Facebook seems somehow wrong . Like masturbating in public . 
is worried . =\\ 
On the way home , I saw 4 cop cars parked in a row , and at least 6 cops standing in a loose circle staring confusedly at what appeared to be a vintage coke machine . Explanation ? 
Happy Vega Month ! =D 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .. Be a good sport and play along ... 
really needs some support right now . =\\
