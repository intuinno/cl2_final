I like how people tell me I listen to bad music when I listen to music about God and actually have meaning with good singing and real instruments , unlike music just about sex with a beat that gets stuck in my head from a synthesizer and fast , repetitive talking . Oh yeah , I'm the one with bad tastes .

Today was fun ! ( : 
I'm done with this . You've got no tolerance for me anymore , and I know you don't want to be around me . It's like talking to a stranger . Alright , you can have your wish . Just don't expect me to come around again . You don't even know me anymore . My ' bffs ' as you call them are just old friends I'm getting closer to . Sorry you can't be my number one anymore . But I'm not sorry you can't accept my religion .

Youth Explosion -- I mean , Youth Explosion 2010 -- was too awesome for words . Still on a high from last night . :D 
Blank songs on my iPod have always annoyed me . But now , after almost 3 hours of constant googling/searching/downloading/copying/pasting/window changing/tabs/typing/annoyance , every song on my iPod now has album < PROPMALE > ! Huzzah ! So worth all that trouble . :D 
< PROPFIRST > Mumford is annoying ! Grrrrr ! :D And < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > needs to get on ! Hahah . :D 
FaceBook gave me a suggestion to like something written in Italian . It meant \A variation of thin pancakes with Nutella . \ " I'm still confused as to why FaceBook gave me this as a suggestion " 
just woke up from a 3 hour nap . Needed it after waking up early and going to orientation -- which was not worth it . Next year , I'm sticking to getting stuff on the first day . 
I'm so tired . .____.

People don't know love because they don't know God . <3 
Why does the smiley face >:D have a unibrow ? 
I'm not perfect . Please stop expecting me to be already . 
Why is so easy for people to give their lives to a secular society which gives them nothing , yet so difficult to give their lives to Christ who gives them everything ? <3 
I just rode down the stairs ... on a mattress . 
Eh , I guess I'll do this too . If you like this , I'll tell you something I like and dislike about you .
