Hit me up when any of you has found a good sized < PROPMALE > Blue suit . 
When you eliminate the Impossible , whatever remains , no matter how improbable , must be the truth . 
I could never believe my paradise turned into a nightmarish hell in the span of a few weeks . 
Today was pretty alright , which is unusual . \ 
Could this be the turnabout I was hoping for ? 
...... \ 
I can't find the damn Blue suit ..... \ 
FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ........... 
Well , if I don't get that Blue suit , I may have to improvise . \

\It's not touching 
Well , the night where little kids in costumes go doo to door begging < PROPFEMALE > from strangers has come to an end . \ 
In all honesty , this was like any other day . \ 
Fan-fucking-tastic . 
Well , I think of me giving her that flower was the right thing to do today ..... I feel that I got a whole month's worth of pain by just doing that . I feel stupid ..... 
I'm so close ... yet so far . \ 
I can tell that something unordinary will happen to me soon . 
Lol , the weather feels fucking awesome ! 
Yesterday , I was at a civil wedding , the judge was walking out . \

I went to a room full of hypocrites this morning , aka church . 
A lil off today . \ 
Was just practicing my spriting skills ... \

I feel like tomorrow will be a day I will regret . 
A week of vacation means a week without her . \

Almost all the fireworks I threw were duds . \ 
Fighting causes the dances to stop . \ 
I slipped 2 times . \ 
Can't ride the ATV for the people that kept on crashing and falling off it . \ 
Coming back in one piece . \ 
Derp .

Too bad I have to spend it in the back of a truck ..... 
Arrived around 2 or 3 am . \ 
Tired . \ 
And surprisingly , going to school .

Follow these steps . \ 
1 : Google top 50 women on the web\ 
2 : Look at woman #7 . \ 
3 : Laugh your ass off . 
Bah ..... 
I think I hit a wall ....... 
Was deciding the fate of my class ring . \ 
Guess this year will be much more easier ... 
Filled with hate . \ 
Show it by smiling . 
Taking the SAT today , but it's not like I'm applying to any college yet . \ 
Heh . 
Mindfucked by the SAT , but I managed to go through ... 
Finished a flipnote ( animated cartoon ) that will be forgotten ... \ 
Either way , it was fun working on the trailer for \Senioritis \"" 
Lul .... 
Had the will to finally pay my bill .... \ 
yay .... 
I've decided to keep on doing episodes of my animated series . \ 
Wish me luck . 
The point is that there is no point . \ 
Everything seems to be an elaborate scam that involves everyone ... 
Ok ..... Early release .... \ 
Discuss . 
My face .... \ 
This Desk . 
I try to talk to people , but all they give me is the middle finger and the phrase \Fuck off\ " . \ 
I went outside and literally let my face hit the icy ground . \ 
Then I stayed there . \ 
Best day of the year .... lul 
Helping my bro write a memoir ... \ 
How did I get a college level mind for writting ? 
People say that they can't go outside ..... \ 
Bullshit . 
96 hours at home . \ 
Sleep time = 18 hours\ 
Outside = 9 Hours\ 
Inside = The rest ....... \ 
I'm so bored . 
Derp 
Today , I saw a fender-bender type of crash , a cat stuck in the snow , and I fell face-flat outside ..... \ 
Yup , Friday just begun . 
After many days being outside , my feet have felt their 1st chill . 
Om nom nom nom ........... 
I'm walking to Calliet today to do absolutely nothing .... \ 
Downloading Flash to do stuff now . \ 
Ima try to be productive ... 
Got a new laptop . \ 
Asus FTW 
Trolls ...... Trolls everywhere . 
Lol , another day with ice .... 
And so the duel begins . \ 
Mexico vs . Bosnia 
I think 3 pieces of myself just died . 
Spent the whole day with < PROPFIRST > , playing and laughing at our troubles . \ 
Thank the people who created < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim . 
Any of you guys know a computer program that can remove the vocals from a song ? \ 
Send me a link if you guys know one , and I tried Audacity , it failed . 
My head ...... this desk 
One more reason to hate this particular Monday . 
Today , I suffered from little nuisances like hitting a wall and tripping . \ 
You know , the things people do that make other people laugh . 
Meh 
I'm being forced to go to a soccer game ..... \ 
How Gay .... 
I rofl'd at the Weed announcement . 
Is planning on getting a Moped ... 
Ugh , people and their stupid Flea-market Computers ... 
I got my Asus back . \ 
Lifetime Warranty FTW ! 
* Semi-sleepy mood*\ 
Mom : < PROPFIRST > , I want you to do millions of chores to do today ... \ 
* KO'd in the Sofa * 
Because there is nothing to do except point at a person's face with a laser pointer when the same person is more than 1inch away from falling to their death . \ 
Spring break , huh ? \ 
Who's starting it early ? 
Lent and that eat no meat on Fridays thing . \ 
Most Catholics don't follow this rule . \ 
I laugh at how hypocritical the people that represent the religion can be . 
And then , my neighbors were arrested .... 
The day the house stood still .... 
is Playing Minecraft . 
MVC3 FTW . \ 
So many spammers online though . 
Trolls+Minecraft = Funny ' cause you can kill Minecraft trolls . 
Look at me , I stayed awake from 3 am for no apparent reason . \ 
I just stared at my ceiling the entire time , lol . 
Spring break = < PROPMALE > Labor week . \ 
yay ....... 
Well ill be damned ...... Im damned by ppl ... derp 
I should be working on my project , but paying $250-$300 for a suite of programs isn't good . 
And then , something terribly good happened .... hehehehe 
Flash Portable version , where < PROPMALE > thou ? 
I don't think I'm going to prom . \ 
If I'm lucky , I'l go somewhere better . 
Minecraft tip : When in doubt , punch trees . 
And then , the whole world just stopped spinning . I fell . 
And thus , I procrastinate once more . And even worse , my computer doesnt have the Windows7 Key . 
And then , my Windows 7 countdown is over . \ 
Now , my computer looks like crap ... 
My slumber was interrupted by < PROPMALE > labor ...... now you tell me what's wrong with that ... 
Fuck , I'm making a game with Gamemaker ? \ 
Fuck me .....
