Soccer Practice today . :( There lucky wednesday is my big tv night . 
I commented on the teen Choice Award WhatTheBuckShow saying that Miley can get away with anything , then this stupid girl comments me back saying \uh no . she gets bashed for everything she does\ " That may be true but she pole danced at the teen choice awards and gets these scandelous pictures online and she still has her DISNEY !!!!! tv show . nuff said . That was my rant on Miley < PROPMALE > " 
soccer practice went ok .... 
< PROPFIRST > was holding the Goldfish box . I asked for some goldfish so she threw the box at my face and cut the side of my nose .

During the commercial of the Daily Show . I forgot what I was watching . Dang . My head is really messed up 
< PROPFIRST > Colbert is right . Kids NEED tv .

Dear < PROPMALE > Wentz and Cassadee Pope , You are both lyrically and musically spectacularly amazing . Please don't turn into actors . I'm sorry your not very good at it . 
My sister stabbed me with a pencil a few hours ago and it STILL FRICKEN HURTS .... not good 
< PROPFIRST > Dawson only needs like 15,000 subscribers to beat KevJumba . Can we make that happen people ? 
I'm so screwed in the summer reading department . 
I woke up like 30 minutes ago . Soon the classroom will be my new bed ... haha just kidding .............. 
came back from a small scrimage . Did ok but I had to play goalie the entire time and this one girl stepped on my hand . 
heeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaaccchhe ow 
I'm only watching Flipping Out because < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is going to be in it . That's the soul reason 
If you have a twitter go and follow < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Black and < PROPFIRST > Showalter to get this twarty started !!!!! How nerdy was that !?!?!?! Whatever just go to the fricken twarty . :)

School was definetly better today than yesterday . I love hanging out with my friends who don't really have a facebook :) 
30 Rock is on !!!!!!! I am not to be bothered 
I'll laugh so hard if < PROPFIRST > Dawson's 2nd channel beats WhatTheBuck . It's not too far away 
back from soccer car wash . my feet are red now and I have sunburn . ew 
* sighs * I need a hug :( 
My mom says there's no < PROPMALE > were coming to Ohio for Christmas . I'm very sad now :'( 
School was so great today . Cept for my headache at the end of the day but at lunch a whole part of my sock ripped off out of no where . we talked about that for awhile :D 
Today was awesome but I was really really really tired today . I think my teachers could tell . My friends are so awesome cus they put up with my laziness and my inability to stay awake ^^ 
Soccer practice on a bad stomache and tired mind . Doesn't thrill me to be honest 
Just came back from a scrimage with the U-15 boys . I was playing goalie and I fell on my elbow wrong which snapped my shoulder which lead my dad to beleive that I broke my collar bone . I don't think I did but it fricken hurts !!!!! 
I'm supposed to be going to the < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > Show on October 10 but I'm very worried if there is an age restriction . It didn't say anything on the webpage but this is the kind of junk they pull out on you as soon as you get there :( 
Back from school . Arm still fricken hurts . 
The best part about watching Green Day live is watching < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > run , jump , and act like he's been eating spoonfuls of sugar all day all around the stage and still have enough breath to sing ^^ 
< PROPFEMALE > from < PROPFIRST > Lopez really ticks me off . She's fricken ridiculous 
My arm is worse now from soccer practice and this is the second time I missed 30 Rock . I'm sad :( 
I didn't get to play my second soccer game today cus I hurt my arm even more in the first playing goalie . My team had a lot to handle with having to make a goalie change and a dumbass for a ref but they still played ok :) 
OMG everyone has some one going to the hospital ! WHAT THE CRAP !?!?!?!? 
Who wants to see me in a cast this week cus I might very well have one . We'll have to wait till Monday to see . 
What do I do man !?!?!?! I am freaking out !!!!!!! The TV isnt working !!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!! 
so much pain ..... cant get to sleep :'( 
no X < PROPFIRST > results yet . I hope my arm is broken or cracked really bad other wise I'll have to do physical therapy . That's gonna be all about moving my arm in the most painful places for months :( 
Ok X < PROPFIRST > update . They didn't see any < PROPMALE > cracks and what not but my arm hurts too much to use the physical therapy the way they want to so there taking me to this weirdo doctor that I don't even really know what does 
Arm Update ! I chipped my elbow and seperated my shoulder . The place where my elbow got chipped is connected to a canal where a nerve likes to sit which explains why my wrist and forearm have been hurting . No soccer for 2 weeks :( 
I just did 2 of these pictures where you can TAG ppl . ...... k 
I can't beleive they voted off < PROPMALE > on Total Drama Action !!!!!!! The only one left now is < PROPMALE > and he's gonna be on a leash by < PROPFIRST > !!!!!! :'( 
The motto was just a lie . It says that home is where the heart is , but what a shame because everyones heart doesn't beat the same . It's beating out of time . 
GO OHIO STATE !! 
Quit thinking the obvious . 
I'M WATCHING HOUSE !!!!!!! sad ..... :'(
