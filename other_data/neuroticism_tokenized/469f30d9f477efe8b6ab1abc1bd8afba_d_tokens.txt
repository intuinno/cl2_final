so damn sad :/ 
sup who's ready for 2 feet of snow tomorrow ? 
oh life how I love you , for screwing me in every possible way throughout the day ... day to day I'm brought to my knees , the sorrow consumes me , like a storm in rough seas , it's the end I can't see ... you teach me how to hate and I yell for help , they say you can't escape fate but I've survived hell before . ( sorry for depressingness @ all ) 
playing classic rock songs on the strat ' , good times :) 
[ 16:06 ] mLine ? super` #mL . gaming : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is the reason < PROPMALE > is hiding 
breakups fucking suck 
got a D+ on a gym test , cool XD 
does anyone remember how many points troj takes off for a lab report that's 1 day late ? 
I'll be your < PROPMALE > , you play the < PROPFEMALE > . The sun won't set , until you appear . Cause I know you're the one , my love , my love . This One's for You - Of Mice and Men <3 
legit about to explode . I am SO fucking fed up with life . 
LIFE IS GOOD SUP 
life sucks =] 
All because of you , I believe in angels , no not the kind with wings , not the kind with halos ... that kind that bring you home , when home becomes a strange place . I'll follow your voice , all you have to do is shout it out . 
what do you do when the one person in the entire world that makes you feel truly happy isn't happy themselves ? :( it kills ... 
trying to get a new phone .... any suggestions ? ( personally leaning towards an env touch ) 
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes ... Should I fight for what is right or let it die ? Now I'm choking on force fed lies . Do I fight or let it die ? I will fight , one more fight . Don't break down in front of me . I will fight , will you fight ? I am not the enemy . 
I am running with a heavy heart . It's like an anchor making sure I never get too far . I am wounded and nearly torn apart . It feels like it's all too much ... Pick up the pieces and put me together , tell me everything is gonna be okay . Give me a reason to get up again , taken more than any one should ever take . 
GREATEST DAY EVER :D :D :D :D 
taking a walk textttt me . 
Lay your heart down , the end's in sight . Conscience begs for you to do what's right . Everyday it's still the same dull knife , stab it through and justify your pride . 
anyone wanna suggest a couple new songs for me to listen to ? preferably nottt pop or rap . 
We're more than carbon and chemicals , we are the image of the invisible . Free will is ours and we can't let go , we are the image of the invisible . ( on a side note , central detention is really boring :D ) 
seriously about to just fall apart and break down :( 
Like the rising tide , beating hearts grow but never die . To simplify , I'll stand by your side , close my eyes , hope will never die . 
new glasses look SWEET :D 
can someone , just please , fucking kill me ? 
if anyone has salzer what were the directions for the project ? 
headbanging to august burns red :D 
Days rolled on , shout it out loud . Days rolled on , we know the price we pay . 
i'm the worst friend in the world :( 
happy .... finally happy . :D <3 life 
fever is MONSTER . 
just bet < PROPFIRST > Norcross that he couldn't make it through 30 minutes of paranormal activity , and he gets $10 if he does :) anyone think it was scary 
is it selling out to give up on all that you love and all that are you just to be popular with the majority and not the minority ? 
new acoustic guitar :D :D :D :d pics later

bored . online chemistry homework wtf . 
\It's just casual racism ... \ " ( c ) < PROPFIRST > C . " 
you're the same as everyone else and honestly idk why that surprises me 
you're in for a gigantic fucking surprise if you thought I was going down without a fight . 
I'm making a difference , I'm taking a chance . \ 
You can say what you want about me , but no one can tell me I can't . 
Waiting , hoping , praying for a settle to this dizzy mind 
debating how many tests I can fail tomorrow before my parents put me up for adoption :D 
i hope everyone posting bs about getting call knows that if we do end up having school , someone is gonna kick their ass . 
sleep . see you all on monday * cough * 
Life for you has been less than kind\ 
So take a number , stand in line\ 
We've all been sorry , we've all been hurt\ 
But how we survive is what makes us who we are 
up at 1:00 AM restringing guitars . this is my life :/ ( for anyone else that plays out there , both guitars have a floating bridge ... gg ) 
waitinggggg for the life to change seems like it's taking me foreverrrr 
i found someone trying to sell used guitar strings on the internet ... cool . 
I've done all I can , and I've still been cast aside . \ 
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe those tears from your eyes . 
it's funny cause when your name comes up on my phone , my heart starts to race again just like it used to ... 
you and me , we stand for something . 
i've had enough of all these empty words ; this is not me giving up , this is me letting go <3 
It's for the blood in my veins for the air in my lungs , for the dreams in my mind and the words on my tongue ; this drives me to sing this anthem we've < PROPFIRST > , it's vital to live now , before we die young 
singles awareness day <3 ftw . 
My bones all resonate\ 
A burning lullaby\ 
You can’t take that from me\ 
Just go ahead and try . 
Do you remember when we were young , and you wanted to set the world on fire ? 
/witty song lyrics ftw 
Only shadows and impressions are left for me to hold\ 
My heart would burst for you if that would make you whole 
rawr . i wanna play in a band really bad . damnit . 
i tried to be perfect but nothing was worth it , i don't believe it makes me real ( also btw holy crap first time on fb for two weeks good stuff ) 
It's always darkest just before the < PROPFEMALE > . So stay awake with me , let's prove them wrong . 
new rise against album endgame is GODLIKE 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Repost if you're against bullying ? 
rawr guitar equipment is way too fuckin ' expensive 
first day of spring :D :D :D 
* cymbal crash * BREAKDOWN . 
[ 22:13 ] B1N4RY SUP3RST4R #ESL : I just don't feel like going to a concert\ 
[ 22:14 ] B1N4RY SUP3RST4R #ESL : where teens are gonna be running around\ 
[ 22:14 ] B1N4RY SUP3RST4R #ESL : killing each other\ 
^on the subject of seeing hardcore bands at warped tour rofl 
so one of the mastering chem problems has a scuba diver's lungs filling up with so much air that they burst . proof that science kills and should not be taught in schools . 
Sailed The Oceans is easily one of the greatest local bands :] ( along with Highlight of the Day of course ) 
feelin sick as hell right now damnitttt 
talk won't work this out . I don't need to shout , I just need to scream . 
looking through the status updates on fb has officially raped my braincells 
sometimes you don't deserve an apology . 
so i open up a bag of warheads and the individual thingies are in their own wrappers , that's how damn sour they are . 
bored . hit me up 
just spilled coke on my floor . so i tore all my chem notes out of my notebook and used them to clean it up :] 
Find your reflection\ 
Smash what you see\ 
And let's restart\ 
' Cause mirrors can't see our heart 
Are you still alive ? Are you scared inside ? \ 
When we've reached the end of the road\ 
I will < PROPFEMALE > us home 
trying to get to P-51 Presents : Spring Breakdown but my dad is maddddd late ... 
really don't wanna shave my beard for tomorrow :[ 
haven't watched nickolodeon in FOREVER <3 
promises we plan to break are made in whispered voices , cause our despair knows many names . we make mistakes but we apologize with roses we never stopped to smell on the way 
kinda disappointed that none of my neighbors call the cops on me for blasting my music with the windows open ... 
\\m/ 
i swear some people really need to get a leash for their tongues or something rofl . 
if I held my ground , would you ask me to change ? this drought bleeds on but we're dancing for rain . drink the air , but it's still not the same . these worlds collide but the distance remains , we point the finger , never accept the blame . 
fuckin phone won't charge :[ 
I'M JUST A TEENAGE DIRTBAG BABYYYYY 
just realized we didn't mention cinco de mayo once in spanish class today . wtf . 
caffeine : the most commonly abused drug in < PROPFEMALE > . woo ! 
Im gay for big black cock 
#brutal 
for you cannot love one until you have learned to love all
