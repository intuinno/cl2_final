Can't sleep so here I am again at 1:50 am killing time 
My baby is 5 today . I feel old . Imagine how I'll feel when she's 20 . 
Plotting and planning to get what I want in life . 
Mommy's new motto : You get what you get and you don't throw a fit

Anything in life is possible and it comes with so many twists and turns that what happens is usually a surprise . Enjoy the ride . 
The deeper you stick in your vein , the deeper the thoughts . There's no more pain . I'm in heaven . I'm a god . I'm everywhere . I feel so high ..... 
Tired of being an afterthought . Tired of being last on everybody's list . Tired of these little reminders that I am completely unimportant . 
If you bore me then I'm comfortable . If you interest me , I'm scared . My attraction paralyzes me ; no courage to show my true colors that exist . But I want to be the real thing ......... My make-up's all off . Who am I ? 
100 days have made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face ... I'm here without you but you're still on my lonely mind . i think about you and I dream about you all the time .... 
I HAD IT ! CHECK YOURS .....!!!! Has your facebook been slow today ? Check your application settiings , go into \added to profile\ " . If you see one in there called \ " unnamed app\ " delete it ... Its an internal spybot ... you have to use the dropdown box and change from recently used to ' added to profile ' to find it . " 
If you & I woke up in jail together ... using only FOUR words ... what would you say to me ? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say .... ( And if you make a comment , you gotta put this in your status . Fair is fair . ) 
Wish I'd died instead of lived ...... 
How ' bout a round of applause ? Standing ovation ? You put on quite a show . Really had me going . Now it's time to go . Curtains finally closing . That was quite a show , very entertaining . But it's over now . Go on and take a bow . 
Go to UrbanDictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name as a comment . 
If I had known the last time was the last time ....................... 
If nothing is impossible but there are some things in life you just can't have , where does that leave me ? 
Don't wanna be my friend no more . I want to be somebody else .... 
I don't like not knowing where my future is headed . I don't like not knowing which path in life will work out the best . How am I suppossed to make decisions if I can't get all the relevant information ? 
Some days I think my life is waning like the < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just passing this along : THERE IS A VIRUS SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE ON FB . DO NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING FROM ME OR ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS THAT ASK YOU TO WATCH A VIDEO ON YOU TUBE . SNOPES JUST CONFIRMED IT IS A TROJAN WORM VIRUS . IT WILL STEAL INFO , INFEST YOUR SYSTEM AND SHUT IT DOWN . DO NOT OPEN THE LINK . PLEASE REPOST THIS IN YOUR STATUS . ( THE TRUTH ! ) 
Feel stupid for being so sad ..... 
sigh 
Why is it sometimes you just can't get someone out of your mind ? Even when you never see them ? Like they're haunting you ? 
Everytime I decide what it is I want , the next day I feel the exact opposite . 
stupid tv didn't record Lost 
Hey you . Hey you . Finally you get it . The world ain't fair . Eat you if you let it .... 
meh ...... 
Somedays you just need a tranq gun .......... 
sigh ! I am hopeful for all the wrong things . But I guess why change now ? 
I am so freaking tired !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
How do I spend my Sunday night ? Writing out bills with my vacation money . Talk about a bite in the ass !!!!! 
When I do a crappy ass day , I really do a crappy ass day !!!!! 
Might not be the most beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be first choice , but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not because I'm just too good at being me . I might not be proud of some of the things i've done in the past but I'm proud of who I am today ! Take me as I am , or watch me as I walk away ..... Post this as your status if you love being you ! xxxxxxxx 
Non-pet owners who visit and like to complain about our pets : 1 . They live here . You don't . 2 . If you don't want their hair on your clothes , stay off thefurniture . That's why they call it ' fur'-niture . 3 . I like my pets alot better than I like most people . 4 . To you , they are animals . To ... me , ... they are young'uns who are short , hairy , walk on all fours and don't speak clearly . Copy & Post if you love your pet 
Either I have some serious pms or I'm having a bipolar moment . This blows !

There is still no known cure 4 someone who needs a foot up the ass ( except for a foot or 2 up the ass ) , but we can raise awareness . 
So pissed about the bad decisions other people make in their lives that completely devastate yours . And there's nothing you can do about it . 
There are 3 days until National Coming Out Day .

You can't talk your way out of a situation you behaved yourself into . Learn it , live it .
