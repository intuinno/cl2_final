HAPPY NEW YEAR ! What a blessing it is to have life ... I'm sending lots of love to everyone who gets this message . Next on the agenda , < PROPFIRST>'s 1st Birthday !!!!! 

I'm on a mini hiatus . Those of you who sent messages I will get back with you soon . 
I LOVE MY FAMILY ! ... extra shout out to my big little sister Shanequa J . < PROPMALE > ! Chic , you are such a wonderful blessing . Thank you Heavenly Father for blessing me . 
Love is the source ! 
Lots of new pictures have been added to < PROPFIRST>'s website ! Check her out at http://sites.bundleofjoys.com/taylormichael/ 
YOU take YOU wherever YOU go ! 
The opposite of love is indifference , not hate ... to hate indicates feeling something and thus to care - to feel indifferent is to feel nothing at all , to love is to feel everything . 
... remembering when little < PROPFIRST > was first born . :-) 
You can do anything you choose to do in life , CHOOSE THE BEST !

The 30 Day Gratitude Challenge ended yesterday ( 10/6 ) . However , I'm doing 31 days , ending today . There’s something special about publicly acknowledging blessings–saying thank you to God out loud . Something about making your values and beliefs known says , you stand for something and won’t fall for just anything . 
So , here are ten final “Gratitude Challenge” postings . I’m glad that so many people were inspired & moved to also post their blessings . It is always an honor to be a vessel for Christ . I am eternally grateful for ...

DO YOU WORRY ALOT ? 1 < PROPFIRST > 5:6 , 7 tells us that to humble ourselves is not to worry . Worry is the mind racing around trying to find a solution to its situation . The proud man/woman is full of him/herself , while the humble man/woman is full of God . The proud man/woman worries ; the humble man/woman waits . Pride ( worry)comes before the fall , < PROPFEMALE > ( waiting ) comes before grace ( blessing ) .
