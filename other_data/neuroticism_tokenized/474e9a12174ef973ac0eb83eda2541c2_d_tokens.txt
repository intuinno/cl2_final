you traded all your paper clips for a soap dish that way your best friend's rubber ducky wouldn't slip and slide away but he traded his rubber duck for a cigar box to place your paper clips in .

I've been waiting my whole life , For a someone like you , To go and steal my heart . Just the way you do . It's been one hell of a year , Here waitin on you , So I've got some questions for you- Did it hurt when you fell from heaven ? Did it hurt just to know I was right here waiting . Did you know , do you know It was love from the first time we touched . 
Depression please cut to the < PROPMALE > and cut a long story short ; Oh please be done , how much longer can this drama afford to run ; Fate looks sharp , severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend . But sadly then , all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again ...

We can't make-up for the lost time that we both apologize for , I cant stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day . You're the center of my day . Mondays I sleep away/ Tuesdays I lay awake/ Wednesdays are the worst/ Thursdays I reminisce , Fridays I see your face And I can breathe . Although the distance is daring , I sure know what it's like to be alone . 
apples are just fantastic . 
help me rename my cat . seriously the first thing that pops in your head , tell me (: 
I renamed my cat Atari . 
And I know your life is such a hell , You wake up early and you work until You have your drinks at 5 o'clock . The hours blend and your thoughts All haunt your hopes , your dreams , Your everything . Well , mama , I hope I dream that you won't leave . And I have a question : What is love ? What is love ? Oh , Is it giving up ? ' Cause that's not how you Raised me , yeah 
It's so hard to pretend Like I know everything . I don't know anything . I wanted you to see , That I got nothin . I'll sit back and I'll watch the show , Yeah I'll watch the show . And I'll lay awake And I'll watch the stars as they collide . And my eyes they don't see . And I don't breathe the way I used to , Yeah my lips wooah , they don't sing . And I won't be the way I was on that night . 
We're just dancing , we're just hugging , Singing , screaming , kissing , tugging On the sleeve of how it used to be .

Just the other day she was a little girl , Taking over the world With her smile . But just the other day I saw that little girl , Taking a tongue down her throat By a boy that didn't give a damn That she was only 15 . ' Cause she was more than willing To take a < PROPMALE > , To find romance , To grow up fast . But I know she is so much better than to give it all away to the first guy , first try , first lie , first goodbye . 
Punishment to interrogation , I got some of the signs but I'm lacking straights answers . Someone as artistic as you , you should be able to to paint the picture for me . The truth for anyone who asks . 
I need a doppleganger you guys ... who do I look like ? 
Sunday mornin ' wake up early , Skip church service to find true meaning . I know it sounds so disappointing , But I just don't belong in a place like that . -- I love the cause but not the act . -- I sing Hallelujah , Hallelujah , Hallelujah ; Hallelujah , I'm set free .

Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone ? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry ? Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside ? It's only half past the point of oblivion The hourglass on the table , the walk before the run The breath before the kiss and the fear before the flames Have you ever felt this way ? 
Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone ? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone , Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry ? Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside ? It's only half past the point of oblivion . The hourglass on the table , the walk before the run .

I must have done somethin ' right , to deserve you in my life . I must have done somethin ' right , along the way . <3 
you're like a suave elephant man . 
I went to a chinese restuarant and they had a suggestion box ; on the piece of paper I wrote \Free Tibet \"."

rough night . 
2/14/10 -- My stomach dropped when we got back to belgrade , but I missed everyone . It's cold , not just here , but everywhere . I'm going to try to start sketch journaling everyday so let's see how long that lasts . 
mostly , I enjoy living . 
I have you breathing down my neck . I don't what you could possibly expect under this condition so I'll wait for the ambulance to come Pick us up off the floor . Slow down .. this night's a perfect shade of Dark blue(darkblue ) . Have you ever been alone in a crowded room ? well I'm here with you . I said the world could be burning ' til there's nothing but dark blue . Just dark blue . 
I cooked chokecherry glazed ham ; it wasn't terrible . 
Just say those three Words I know you're thinking . I sick of wasting time on these formalities , Please never leave my side . So please don't forget to Call me just to let me know , You're doing okay < PROPMALE > away from me . So please tell me darling , Why you're so far away When I need you beside me tonight . 
And I don't want the world to see me , Cause I don't think that they'd understand . When everything's made to be broken , I just want you to know who I am . And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming , Or the moment of truth in your lies . When everything seems like the movies , Yeah you bleed just to know your alive . 
cast party was fun last night :) i'm sad seniors aren't going to be around anymore :/ 
mi padre gave me Life of < PROPFIRST > to watch :D 
The clock never stops and I hate this damn phone , Somedays I wanna run from the place I call home . I guess I´m just needing some danger .

Hi sir . 
SIR I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO STEP AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE . SIR . 
It's just a jump to the left ! 
Animal Farm : I want to burn it . 
there are bigger things happening here than me and you . 
I hate where my house is .... I always see people I know walking by on the sidewalk and they can see inside my house because of the giant sliding glass door and window that's conveniently placed right next to it . 
\d-do your hands smell like .... lavender ? \ " \ " uh ... uh ... o-o h yeah I was just uh ... punchin ' some candles . \"" 
hugs not drugs , kids . 
Exoneration lost his eraser , But my forgiver found the sun . And there are twisted days that I take comfort Cause I'm not the only one . No , I'm not the only one . In the dark , for a while now . I can't stay very far , I can't stay much longer . Riding my decision home . 
being alive is very poetic . 
Just put yourself in my new shoes . And see that I do all I do . Because the old guard still offends . ( Their pudgy hearts and slimy hands ) They got nothing left on which we depend . So enlist every ounce Of your bright blood . And off with their heads . Jump from the hook . You're not obliged to swallow anything you despise , That you despise . 
my orange shirt has cryptic lightning bolts and spiderman is rescuing a girl through 100 yards . triple shot & fried crawfish . 
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst , With all their lions , and all their might , and all their thirst . They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin , Against the walls , against your rules , against your skin .

You've been acting awful tough lately ; Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately . But inside , you're just a little baby . It's okay to say you've got a weak spot , You don't always have to be on top . Better to be hated than love , love , loved for what you're not . You're vulnerable , you're vulnerable . You are not a robot . You're loveable , so loveable , But you're just troubled . Guess what ? I'm not a robot , a robot . 
DERP 
University of Washington , I love you . 3 more years 
I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV , And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be . I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you . Can't do anything except be in love with you . And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be . All I do is keep the beat , the bad company . And all I do is kiss you , through the bars of a rhyme . < PROPFEMALE > , I'd do the stars with you any time . 
Yours is the first face that I saw . I think I was blind before I met you ; Now I don’t know where I am , I don’t know where I’ve been , But I know where I want to go . And so I thought I’d let you know : That these things take forever , I especially am slow . But I realize that I need you , And I wondered if I could come home . 
\Do you love her ? \ " \ " I don't know . I'd have to think about that . \ " \ " It's not really a thinking question . \"" 
It's complicated , ( This time I think it could be ) Triangulated , ( It could be just what we need ) . So what d’you say , we give it up and walk away ? nothing to salvage , anyway . 
my ambition in life is to be as strange as possible and have no one think to question me being any different . 
I swear , if people don't stop using the wrong \you're/your\ " I'm going to snap and become a homicidal maniac . "

Happy Zombie Jesus Day everyone n_n 
I am certain now that , I am Vindicated . I am selfish . I am wrong . I am right . I swear I'm right , I swear I knew it all along . And I am flawed , But I am cleaning up so well . I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself . So turn up the corners of your lips , Part them and feel my finger tips . Trace the moment , fall forever . 
Not really in the mood to do practically my entire graphic novel today : I 
so if you must go , and by that i mean if you must fly away . and if you must leave , and by that i mean if i must wake up from my sleep . how will i know , i wasn't dreaming of heaven ? i know you can't hear me anymore . theres too many walls , too many doors . but as you walk away wont you think of me , remember us how we used to be .

So , somehow during the night I managed to kick all the sheets of off myself but keep my comforter on me perfectly . I don't even 
Where did November go ? 
I had a lovely day , facebook . 
\Love 
Drama meet in Ennis at 5:45 a.m. why , why , why . 
FRAUDALERT : Apparently\ 
the group asking everyone to change their profile picture to their \ 
favorite cartoon is actually a group of pedophiles . They're doing it \ 
because kids will accept their friend request if they see a cartoon . \ 
Nothing to do w/ supporting child violence . It was on that TV show that \ 
warns you about internet fraud . It's on tonight's news . Pass this on to \ 
everyone who has a cartoon profile picture . 
So , uh , Burlesque was awesome . I am not ashamed of this statement . And < PROPFEMALE > is smokin . That's all . 
eh , I'll give in . Send me a random number in my inbox , on my phone , on chat , whatever and I'll post what I honestly think about you . 
#59 - I can honestly say I don't you very well at all , but from what I've heard around you seem like a really nice , very strong person . 
#64 - Well , what can I say ? I think we started talking a year or so ago , but not very closely , but recently we've become pretty close , I think . You're one of the nicest people I know that is taken for granted way too often , which I admit I have done . You're very , very smart , and I think you know your priorities , hopefully being by the coast will make you happier . 
#327 -Uh , I don't really know you xD I'm so sorry , you seem so nice though . And you're gorgeous ! 
#666 - Well , I've only met you once , so this is kind of uninformed . But , < PROPMALE > adores you , so this means that I do too . From what I've heard , you've been through so much , which is something to look up to . You're very impressive , in all ways , from character to how beatiful you are . Haha . 
#618 - I live with you [: 
#222222 . 2- You are my soul mate , and we've known eachother for six years . We discovered Cello Man together . This means that we may never part . 
#3 . 14- Well , your number is Pi , so that is awesome . And you are awesome , though I don't know you too well . Great music choice , definitely , and you seem like a genuinely nice fellow . 
#33 - Hmm , well , I can't say I know you too well . But you're a nice guy , it seems , and you make everyone in the room really happy when you're around . 
#2 - You are my favorite thing , and I do not mean that figuratively . I miss you when you're not around , always , and I even miss you when you're next to me , which isn't often enough . We have so much in common , and so much left to experience ; we're going to go everywhere . You have beautiful eyes , and you always make me feel happy just by talking to you , even if I've had an awful day . 
#1005 - Hm , well , I can't say I know you extremely well , but you've always been very nice to me and you have the ability to light up a room . Also , you'll find the right guy , you just have to be patient . 
#22 - I've known you for a while , and you've always been a really nice , sincere person . You're very pretty , and talented , and not afraid to be yourself . 
I'm done with the < PROPFIRST > thing , children . 
I had a very good day , Facebook . 
Okay , < PROPFIRST > Vedder . I will always be in love with your voice . 
DADT has been repealed , much rejoicing . 
\Some days you'll feel sad without knowing why . Like you lost something very precious but forgot what it was . Or like you miss someone you never met . \"" 
The fog is so thick by my house , I feel like I'm living in space . 
??? 
Spirited Away , < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > , and the Holy Grail have been on today . I am very happy . 
\When there's nothing left to burn you have to set yourself on fire ! \"" 
For New Years in the Netherlands they burn their Christmas trees in the streets . We are so boring . 
All those wasted hours we used to know . Spent the summer starin ' out the window . 
And your heart felt good , it was dripping pitch and made of wood . And your hands , and knees , felt cold and wet on the ground beneath . 
< PROPFEMALE > is on the < PROPMALE > Norton show in a red wig oooh myyy goddd 
Would anyone like a Nevershoutnever bracelet ? 
Still a pisces :) 
First day of driving , did not die . Feeling very accomplished . 
15 hours of sleep , like a boss . 
I am one of the select few that has always loved < PROPFIRST>'s day . 
Holla back . 
48 hours of social overdose and the flu . I'm going to drink mint tea and be cantankerous now . 
My evening has been whittled down to making popping noises with my pen and drinking too much coke . I need to get out . 
\And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you . And from above you how I sank into your soul 
\And chaos is love and they say love is blind . \ 
futurama marathon all up in here 
\You and I have something in common . \ " \ 
I'm quirky and unique and don't like football blah blah blah . Love me I'm special 
Okay so I promised myself that I wouldn't say anything about half time , but I just watched it on youtube and hearing Fergie sing sweet child of mine made my heart die . 
\The unending amends you made\ 
Stereotypical negative commentary about < PROPFIRST>'s day . 
fox is playing all christmas episodes why ? 
\Buddhist wise men say that the path to spiritual fulfillment lies in knowing how to build a healthy ego while developing a part of oneself completely foreign to the ego . Are you working hard at this ? \"" 
My name is < PROPFIRST > P . Bacon , doubly obliged . 
All I’ve known is that there is an end , then you can begin again . Day , everyday . I had a dream that the sea was helpless . The crowd was loud . I went to leave . Can I come to your house ? Caught in the ropes and the wires , the sun settles hard in the south . Winter lives in my bones . When you awake you’re alone . \ " , 2011-03-09 02:53:20 " 
I saw this wino , he was eating grapes . I was like , \Dude

I was five and he was six\ 
We rode on horses made of sticks\ 
He wore black , and I wore white\ 
He would always win the fight , bang bang . 
\I am leaving this harbor 
Let's plant grass seeds in all our shoes and paint yellow inside our hats , so even when it's cold and dark we will always feel like we are walking barefoot in the sunshine . 
\Knock
