Been in North < PROPFEMALE > with my Mum and no internet . so i'm just now checking facebook and emails ( at the airport in NC , on their wi-fi ) . I miss everyone soooo much ! 

Thanks for all the Birthday wishes :) I've had a great day ! And if you've text me , i'm not just not answering , I lost my phone on St. < PROPFEMALE>'s :( So you can just get a hold of me on here .. for the time being anyways . too broke to get a new phone just yet 
I love Felicity Macphee she's my idol ! 
blah blah blah 
I like it on the floor 
Most people have a 1000 wishes for christmas ; a cancer patient only has one : to get better . i know 97% of you won't re-post this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . in honour of someone you know has died , or is fighting , or has survived cancer , please copy and repost ?
