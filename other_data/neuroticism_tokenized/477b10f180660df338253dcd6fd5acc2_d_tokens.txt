Nothing on my mind today . 

I had something on my mind today , but I got it off cause it was real heavy . 
< PROPFEMALE > monkeys sitting on a branch in the breeze . One is named < PROPFIRST > , one is named < PROPFIRST > , and the girl is named < PROPFEMALE > . 
I once had a mind but now it's lost . 
A mind is a terrible thing to waste . I use mine for a paperweight 
The mind is like an expensive sports car . You need to give it regular maintenance including and oil change and lube . Of course when you do this with your mind it tends to slide right out your ear . 
< PROPFEMALE > likes to eat bananas all night . < PROPFIRST > is forgetful , and < PROPFIRST > howls in the moonlight . 
Rats !

I wonder ? 
I bet someone will write back to me if I say something inane like the taste of the sky is vanilla with red sprinkles . 
Everyone here is well . Glad you and < PROPFEMALE > are the same . 
Since I haven't written a comment here in a while I thought I would . 
Life is like a bowl of lemons . \ 
If you take them outside with a baseball bat you can smack the hell out of them , one at a time . 
There is no place like 127.0.0.1 
Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs , and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots . So far , the Universe is winning 
Genius is more often found in a cracked pot than in a whole one . \

\Men are from Mars . Women are from < PROPFEMALE > . Computers are from hell . \"" 
Rebuilding a new computer and learning a new OS , shoot me , shoot me now . However , so far I'm really liking Windows 7 .
