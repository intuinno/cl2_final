I snow removed 2 times today , and there's more to remove . Let it snow ! Let it snow ! I'm ready . I'm cooking the ham bones for bean soup tomorrow . 

The fires works have been going off nightly around our neighborhood for thepast week -- much to the dogs ' chagrin . They are afraid to go out and pee -- do you know how long a standard poodle can \hold it \"?" 
I'm having trouble uplaoding the movie of < PROPFEMALE > on her car -- so sad because it's a great video . Happy New Year . 
Okay -- not too much time left before the real new year starts -- work , schedule etc . oh that's right -- some of you are retired . oh well . 
The Dog Party went well -- and if I can figure out how to post pictures , maybe I can a picture of the \group\ " shot on the < PROPFEMALE >." 
Check out the pictures -- I can do this . 
Well , back to getting the Rig packed , and things ready to go -- and make sure that the doggies have their tic protection ., 
We made it back from Sun Lakes -- no rain . Highlight of the trip was < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and I introducing S'mores to < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > has photos , so maybe they'll end up on facebook . 
well back to work . 
I'm ready for a break in summer weather--it's just too hot . Even the dogs agree . 
I'm sitting here wasting time waiting for my computer to stop printing some who knows what that it is spewing out . Who says that computers save us time . Certainly no less frustrating , just quicker tot eh frustration . 
I'm happy to report that once my printer releived itself it was fine . It just does that every once in awhile -- and for the most part I consider it a quirk that is rather likeable . 
Hawaii became a state 8/21/1959 , just after Alaska in January . 
Well , today is too hot to garden , so after I waste some here , I may just go back to bed . 
We have had a Monday kind of WEEK -- so much so that we cancelled clinic tomorrow . Maybe it is the full < PROPFEMALE > ??????? 
We made it back to the Burg -- after a great visit with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and of course , < PROPFEMALE > . So sad , my camera decided to do something really kinky -- lovely shades of lavender and dream quality images , so no pictures to share . 
Just for all of you out there that want me to do something that involves cutting and pasting -- for some unknown reason , that function does not work on my computer . It may be the time that there was a problem and the Blue Screen of Death appeared . Most of the computer came back okay , but two things that are not are the cut/paste and making CD's . I've managed to live with this all this time so I guess I'll continue 
I have a new birthday toy -- after my current dig . camera decided that the only view worth having was blurred < PROPFEMALE > hues -- pretty but not what I had in mind -- a Nikon dig camera . It is much lighter than my previous one , and now I get to play--What's a grandma without a camera ????? 
Well ... the Oregon Coast ( known as OC ) was simply fabulous . Cape Lookout was almost too hot . No wind . Great time away . 
I can't believe how much the grass grew while we were gone ... but it's mowed for now . 
The great excitement in my life is that we have a new washer/dryer pair -- one of those front loading things . Tonight is the first voyage -- I feel slightly intimidated . or maybe just dated . 
Today the 3 dogs that I don't totally groom became beautified . I will groom < PROPFEMALE > -- and then get the yearly portrait taken . I hope that it snows a lot more because that could make a great shot of the beasts . 
Tomorrw is < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday -- this year we are celebrating under the radar -- nice roast beast , etc . 
Actually----Rebecca's birthday is tomorrow -- we are celebrating today . 
I am so exhausted -- giving H1N1 shots to three year olds is really terrible . They come in so happy to be at our office and then look at me after the shot with such an expression of my betrayal -- I think that we have given all of our little ones shots now -- but that age group :( , :( :( 
Okay , I've wasted enough time and now I need to go to the office and clean up the mess I walked away from yesterday because I couldn't face it then . 
I'm thinking that vacation is a good idea -- just hiding out for awhile . But , alas , the dogs need me to go out and buy them some food . 
It's time to get on with chores ... 
Ah , the bragging rights for a year ... UOP/OSU 
Today is the celebration of St , < PROPFEMALE > -- you go girl !!!!!!! It is also the anniversay of < PROPFEMALE>'s great-grandmother < PROPFEMALE>'s death . Coincidence ? I think not . 
Check out GET . 
So , the clock that counts down to Christmas is on Eastern time ? Right ... 
So , I am trying to have a somewhat stress free holiday -- at least I've had some time with < PROPMALE > ( my favorite Christmas story ) but I've not watced < PROPFIRST > Brown Christmas yet -- maybe because somebody decided to sell \ < PROPFIRST > Brown Trees\ " oh well . " 
I\m getting the house ready for a crawler -- trying to remove the worst of the < PROPFEMALE > hair . After the cold snap she decided it was time to blow some coat . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! " 
It's Boxing Day -- a few of you will know what that means . Around here , it's getting all the stuff into the recycling bin . My dogs think it's saturday -- meaning time to go out and run with their dog and human friends . Fortunately , it is saturday . Blessings abound . Sunshine ! 
BTW , I think my grandchild -- Miss Lucy -- is the cutest , most wonderful , little girl in the universe -- some of you may disagree -- but how could you really . 
My dogs do not like fire works . 
I've not spent any time lately at the computer -- somehow sleep has seemed like a better idea . 
Hello to you both -- what\up ? " 
Just when I'm getting comfortable with FB they up and change it -- why ???? 
Hey -- Lucy is about to turn 1 whole year old -- can you believe that ? 
Just returned from Bellinham -- waht a great time -- Lucy is mellow , and very aware of her audience -- she made sure that all the grandparents thought she was cute -- not too difficult to go along with . Three Grandmas , two Granpas -- all in one room -- what more could a girl need ? We corrupted her by giving her ice cream much to her mother's chagrin . What fun . 
Today is < PROPFEMALE>'s #9 birthday !!!!!!!!! All but two of her littermates were at the field running today . It does seem like we just added her and that she has always been here at the same time . Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > ( and Fortunata , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , Pallo , < PROPFIRST > , and fond thoughts for the late Angus . ) 
I'm wondering how Montee's doctoral defense went , and if he is now known as The Rev Dr. C . Montee Kennedy , ESQ Or is it The Dr. Rev , ESQ ? ( D . < PROPFEMALE >.) 
Hey--I'm re-certified -- I have a card to prove it -- but only CPR . They had the \dummies\ " on the table -- so does that mean that \ " they\ " read my wall ? At least I didn't have to pretend that I could get up and down off the floor like a 20 year old . " 
The weather outside is frightful , but the fire is so delightful , --- happy easter . 
I'm taking a \mini-vacation\ " of the mind -- doing things today that will rest my spirit -- even if some of things are housework . I've been doing a lot of pondering this Lenten Season and now it's time to put the words down in my journal . " 
Jesus Christ is Risen today -- Alleluia !!!!!! Blessings to you all . I can hardly wait to sing all those alleluias that have been hidden during Lent . 
I rather like the sunshine and the snow flurries -- big flakes moving horizontally across the way . Spring time in the basin .... 
I just finished washing and drying the four dogs--it's really hard to get them into the wash machine -- but they just plain refuse to go into the dryter . I still remember the old e-mail of washing the cats ... 
It looks like I'll be able to spend some time gardening today -- get my hands dirty , play in the dirt , and maybe the wind will not blow -- but first hair cut and then meet my sister and < PROPFIRST > for lunch . Life is good . 
It happens every spring -- I forget how many muscles I haven't used all winter -- even doing exercises -- but first run the dogs , then get back to the dirt . 
Please take a few minutes to look at the medicare meltdown issue , and for laughs , the Disscovery Channel \specials \"" 
Why would I respond to an ad ( in the margin ) directed to \Oregon University Alumni\ " ???? We who attended and graduated know that it is University of Oregon --- or UO . " 
Okay--here's an idea ( not original) -- get a copy of your birth certificate and fold it into a 6 pointed < PROPFEMALE > and where it on your chest so all can see . No , I think that was sort of done before -- maybe we should just provide t-shirts with a birthcertificate imprinted in some gawd awlful color ? 
Hey -- today I received a questionnaire because I'm such a \loyal Republican\ " It's pretty interesting the way the questions are worded -- so sad . " 
Well , I did brave the wind and did some gardening .. but it is hard to do anything in it . 
To celebrate mother's day -- and knowing that this is the weekend in this area where \traditionally\ " it is time to plant -- I am going to try to make it to Bloomtime nursery and buy some new items for the garden -- continuing in my quest to have a selection of perenials which bloom throughout the season -- and also again attempt to plant items and protect them from my dogs :) . " 
Blessings to < PROPFIRST > -- it is so much fun to shop at Bloomtime !!!!! ( < PROPFIRST > \plays\ " at working there -- and I do miss his flower store -- but at least he shares his expertise and attitude there . ) " 
My new printer arrived and I just installed it -- wow -- it was easy and it works . Yea ! So now to bed and tomorrow to celebrate Pentecost . 
guess I'll mow the lawn before it rains . 
Since I awoke to rain , I decided to do something else on my list -- I brushed and partially groomed my sheltie , < PROPFEMALE > and now I have found at least two more shelties in the collection of hair that is on the kitched florr . I found another poodle just from the feet hair I trimmed from Harper . Now , if I could just get all the hair off from me . The process isn't done though . 
So I was exploring and I discovered that there is a group called Renaissance -- then I wento to Amazon and listened some -- think I may have to get some -- Pauline do you know the group ? 
So I earned some butch points today -- you see , a motorhome goes down the road jiggling and moving its parts --- and of course , in time screws loosen etc . At the end of last season a drawer fell out . I looked in -- no big deal , just set some more screws add some wood glue and all is good . EXCEPT -- everything fits into things in miniature and getting it to go was -- as I like to say -- interesting . But it's done . 
Today after church , I pulled some weeds for awhile . I am happy to report that all my pulling and bitching re : buttonweed has done some good . There isn't as much around . It's an unending process--can't rest on my \laurels \"-- but then I didn't plant any . " 
What I feel is melancholia--it's a feeling that surrounds my father's death . He died of cancer related to his activities during WWII . ( we think ... ) He was deferred from service as an engineer for GE . In spite of the Freedom of Information Act , we still do not know what he did . I'm thinking that there are many others out there who died in the service of their country who will never be recognized as such . 
So , now I've veen going through < PROPFEMALE>'s Southern Lifestyle cookbooks to find the 7-up pound cake recipe -- no luck yet . 
Today is National Donut day -- I can feel the fat sinking into my gut , and I've not even had a donut . 
We get to spoile < PROPFEMALE > in a few hours ..... 
Hey , I finally mowed the lawn -- not as easy task since it has been well watered by nature after I fertilized . 
Just returned from a great time with < PROPFEMALE > and her parents . Saturday weather was wonderful . Dogs played outside a lot Came home to find < PROPFEMALE > ( the cat ) no longer among the living . Two cats left from the original 5 . 
< PROPMALE > purchased a Rhumba or is it iRhumba for the office , and it finished charging before I left , and then I had to FORCE myself out of the door and leave because it was so fascinating to watch it move around the floor and vacuume . We've named it \Hal \"." 
There are some real advantages to these new fangled devices . I really enjoy going on line to find recipes -- I can remenber so-and-so's dish that I really likes , but don't remember her name let alone the dish -- but google helps me out -- with the recipe , not the person's same . 
why is it I only notice the errors in spelling , etc . after I hit \share \"?" 
Dog Day Out was GREAT ! I'll try to get my movie onto FB this afternoon . My dogs haven't woken up except to eat ( < PROPFEMALE > will never willingly miss a meal) -- but what a great time . Thanks < PROPMALE > for your work -- well worth it ! 
Check out the youtube dog party pictures . 
Anybody know how to send the video to Subaru ? 
I just returned from the grocery store and seemed to have timed it with elderly parent grocery shopping . I observed some wonderful scenes -- one a man was very patiently explaining to his presumed mtr that this IS < PROPFEMALE > yogurt in the Lite variety . He was so gentle . The whole experience brought tears to my eyes . ( No , < PROPFEMALE > , I wasn't putting you into this group ... there were also young people shopping . ) 
I guess everyone else is out doing the Sunday almost summer thing . But my house smells good having done a \once over cleaning\ " . There are lots of things I \ " should\ " be doing but I'm not . " 
Happy summer soltice ! 
Making plans for summer -- but wanting to go back to bed -- 
I just completed the \alphabet novels ( A-U ) and now I'm at a loss -- anybody have some authors out there to try -- mystery variety . For \ " junk\ " books I prefer mysteries . " 
I love this town ! Our Motorhome has a very dead battery -- so dead that I can't get it started with our thingie -- so decided it would have to be replaced anyway -- called Ellensburg Tire -- they are going to bring the battery out and replace it here . So if I can't get butch points for getting it started up at least I can get style points for getting it taken care of easily . 
I'm trying to get some housework done -- but the yard keeps calling and the dogs need food and I'm really enjoying my book that I'm reading oh what to do what to do ..... 
I heard some time this week that the \voice\ " of < PROPFEMALE > died . She was 81 . ( The disney one ) I don't know which is sadder -- that < PROPFEMALE > died or that she was only 81 -- She must have been quite young when it was filmed . " 
I'm torn between getting stuff done around here and getting a head start on office stuff -- but I'll probably do a little a both . I'm moving slowly since I was up last night finising my latest book -- 
The office is complete -- except for all the work we need to do to put it back together -- tomorrow is going to be a BUSY day ! I did get the floors scrubbed in the exam rms . Just need to put down waz . 
We have the place ( office ) put back together -- and now it remains to be seen if we can move tomorrow as we go back to work . I'm hoping < PROPMALE > will put some pictures on FB -- because it really is nifty looking . We have a different kind of space -- our pts oftentimes call the reception area the \living room . \"" 
Please take a look at the DOMA decision , and sign the petition . thanks . 
The thermometer on our front porch is 94 -- in the shade -- and it feels every degree -- but after our cool spring I'm TRYING not to complain . 
Well--I'm getting some stuff done , but a siesta sounds good . The natural clothes dryer is working well . 
Children don't read < PROPFEMALE > tales to learn about dragons -- they already know about dragons -- they read < PROPFEMALE > tales to learn how to slay them 
Washed dogs -- had to because I washed the bedspread and no use putting it on the bed and then allowing really dirty dogs on it ... I did think about < PROPFEMALE > ing them on the line with the bedspread to dry-but all of the dogs except < PROPFEMALE > dried quickly and I can't figure out how to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > on the line--she's more of a spin cycle kind of girl . 
For those of you who know < PROPFEMALE > ( sister ) you will find it humorous that I am cleaning house in anticipation of < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s visit for Jazz in the Valley . It is necessary to clean once in awhile -- and most of the summer I spend my energies on the outside -- so it's an excuse ( the visit ) to clean inside . 
It was probablt too hot to be outside mowing the lawn -- but it is done and I can rest inside in the AC . 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > made it here -- at the time when they said they would -- since I didn't believe the time line , I was out doing errands . We chose not to go to Jazz tonight -- but I presume they are enjoying it . I hope to get them out to the field tomorrow to run the dogs . 
Is it safe now to be online ? That was some storm that came through here ! 
Anyone know where the fire is -- it seems we have some smoke in the air . 
The good thing about wind is that when you < PROPFEMALE > clothes on the line they dry quickly -- the bad thing is trying to < PROPFEMALE > them up before the wind catches them and takes them to Kittitas . ( that's a community east of here for those of you who are not fortunate enough to be here . 
If I might whine a bit ( no cheese please ): while I spend a great deal of my time ignoring the daily pain of arthritis and whatever else it is , I'd like to say right now that I'm tired of it !!!! Every move I've made this weekend has reminded me that \it\ " is there . Okay I'm better now . " 
I can hardly wait for the dog parade -- and to see Miss < PROPFEMALE > ride on Fuzzy's back on a western saddle ---- (Fuzzy is a St. < PROPMALE > . I hope I can get pics to post on this ! 
I consider myself pretty savy when it comes to electronic gadgets -- but why must instructions be written in such a way that only the insiders know what's being said .. the instructions with items ought to be previewed by us intelligent but -ah-older people !!!! (I just spent 3 hours downloading something .... ) 
As the shirt says--You're only as old as you remember ---- 
We just returned from an outsatanding dinner at Portals , at Suncadia Lodge . The food , service , presentation etc . were all great . I'm curious where they found so many well behaved children to join us in the restaurant . -I did wonder why I didn't think to bring a coat -- it was chilly as we left . ( < PROPMALE > , I didn't pay attention -- great fish -- but I'm not sure if they had any vegetarian faire ) . 
Thanks for the birthday wishes -- I feel gifted as I have the next 2 days off -- means I can get ready for vacation . 
Two dog dentals ( sounds like a movie title ... ) They are fine , but Harper also had his ear cleaned out -- he has a lot of ear hairs that grow very deep in his ears -- unusual even for a standard poodle -- but the problem with his frequent infections . 
too much to do -- too little energy -- focus , focus focus . 
I'm pretty excited . I have been exercising using a resistance chair -- and while I'm not seeing much change in the # of pounds -- I can notice a dramatic change in that my jeans are really loose !!!!! I'm also able to move much better without as much pain ( my goal ) . 
We made it home -- back from < PROPMALE > City -- rain , sun , rain , then more sun . Sorry < PROPFEMALE > , it was beautiful < PROPFEMALE > after you left . More later -- need to shower and get some sand off me . 
Gee -- I did a lot of laundry yesterday -- still more to go . Lawn to mow and water . the usual stuff . 
Will someone please explain to me why all of a sudden Facebook wants a credit card # or a mobile phone number to \verify\ " my account . -- that's not going to happen . " 
well -- the dogs are finally cleaned from their trip to the sand . Who knows what < PROPFEMALE > rolled in ( I do not want to know) -- but they are all fresh smelling at least until they go out to the field and run . 
So -- we were leaving Bellingham -- and see a cop car whip around--couldn't think that we were the target -- but soon were stopped -- the officer came up and said , \Hello Ladies -- I didn't mean to stop you -- I just had a report about someone on North St. but you don't have a man in the car -- so Have a nice day ! \"-- I knew there was a reason not to have a man in the car !!!! " 
So--I'm a bit tired and I am proctrastinating doing the sunday night things -- so I've found quizzes on facebook . 
Hello -- anybody in there ? I feel like I'm in a time warp . 
OMG ! I forgot that this is when all the students are coming into town and I went shopping at < PROPFIRST > Meyer without any valium or a drink . I ask the guy at the check out counter if there was a bar nearby and he just rolled his eyes at me -- he did say it had been a \little\ " busy today ! " 
Great party for Miss Haley -- who is now 4 years old . 
Today we blessed the animals at church -- and as usual < PROPFEMALE > processed with the choir -- I must teach her to bow at the cross -- but she always impresses everyone as they should be . She does remember her training when she should . She's such a good dog ! ( good thing Harper was not there -- there were several golden's--and for some reason he has a problem with them . ) 
is a lesbian and National Coming Out Day is tomorrow . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and the government's failure to recognize LGBT families for immigration purposes tears bi-national couples and families apart .

I'm thinking that it is time for a vacation -- oh well . ( do have some w/e plans coming up . ) 
I did lots of exciting errands today -- oil changes , winterizing , dogs groomed , and went to have my physical plus flu shot . Wow--I'm tired . 
I think I have to go back to work -- I did too much work this weekend -- the kind that piles up and buries you eventually . 
I'm dazed and confused , but mostly decided on the Wa state ballot measures . Whew ! 
Safely home from NYC ! What a great trip to Time Square and back . Driving Miss < PROPFEMALE > was great -- dinner with Nate and First was even better . Barb -- the dogs seem happy , so I hope all went well here . Back to the fantasy world tomorrow . 
so there's a problem at the Newark airport--I'm glad I'm not flying into Newark today ! 
I was able to get the cats crated for their vet visit far too easily -- hmmmm wonder what they are planning to do ? 
< PROPFIRST > ( female cat ) is hyperthyroid -- which has caused < PROPMALE > weight loss -- she is now on a med to help that . She was at one point in her life a bowling ball with a head -- she now looks like a tennis racket from the side . And let it be known that it is much easier to give a pill to a dog ( harper ) than to a cat . 
Well--I'm happy to say that for now -- at least -- Freddie is happy to take her pill as long as there is adequate tuna ( human variety ) surrounding it . I did find some very very funny youtube videos of giving pills to cats . 
Interesting election -- here and in the nation . 
Today was magical -- with the beginning of winter ( in spite of the calendar ) snow , snow , snow !! Ellensburg has 4 wonderful seasons -- and each one is special . I think that one of the bests is winter . The first snows cover the yard work that I haven't completed -- and now will have to wait for spring . 
I have a new part to my resistance chair -- a bicycle that attaches -- kind of a recumbent style so there is less stress on the knees . 
Well these little creatures are fun --- :) * :P * :( * <3 * 
Where's the SNOW :D 
I was helping < PROPFEMALE > up the stairs like I do every nigh t--t onight she had a 6 inch sunflower -- very dried --- complete with a nine inch stem stuck in her pantaloons . Such is a dog's life . : * :*\ 
\ 
I sent you a smiley ! Want to see it ? http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=116318625062183&v=app_4949752878&partner=ZNzfb008_XNxdm003YYUS 
What happened to the smiley faces and turkeys ? 
Maybe they are back ? :) :( :P <3 : *:D:-/:'(:)*:(*;)*:P*<3*\ 
I heard today that a scientist was studying dogs and feels they know more about human behavior than any other species ... Well duh ! Is there a dog person out there who doesn't already know that ? My four know that today is not a work day and they should be getting special attention -- or at least helping me with my chores . 
IT IS SNOWING !!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D \ 
Today at Grace Episcopal the CWU trombone quartet provided \special\ " music . What a joy to have experienced their music . " 
It's really cold . Snow is on the ground . The sun is shining brightly . My kind of day . ( Reminds me of winter in Bend . ) 
Isn't there a better way to heat stores ? It's 5 degrees so in order to get to the store I have on my long johns etc . and then in the store it's so hot I nearly passed out --- oh well . 
The dogs had a great time playing in the snow -- they were wearing some gear to keep them warm except Zoe -- she has enough cover . Then out with the high pressure dryer ( for dogs ) to remove the snow balls from feet and legs . The sun is out and it is near the thawing point ( 31.9 degrees ) but I'm still hoping for more snow today . 
Okay -- Happy December and HO HO HO . :P * :P * :) * <3 *\ 
Oh , I was Beaver born and Beaver Bred -- but I overcame my upbringing -- GO DUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Well- UO did it . I don't really follow football so I didn't realize that they have been undefeated this season . :P That's to may family members who are OSU grads .

I want the Christmas < PROPFEMALE > to come in and orgainze my office space , and also clean both my house and my work space . ;) *\ 
Okay -- who invited this blessed rain ? Snow ! SNOW ! not rain ! 
For those of you in the Ellensburg area -- Grace Episcopal Church welcomes you Sunday , December 19 @ 3:00 PM to participate in \Lessons and Carols\ " . It is always lovely . " 
Lessons and Carols -- Sunday , Dec 19th at 3PM -- but be early -- Grace Episcopal Church ( Ellensburg ) 1201 N . B street near the park . Always fun -- several new groups are joining us this year . 
cleaning , cleaning , cleaning -- since < PROPFEMALE > didn't show up I am forced to do it myself . 
Okay--here's the problem : four dogs , one with long hair that is always coming out -- add carpet that is short-and very nicely attracts all that fur . Is there a vacuum out there that will actually remove the hair ? My dyson works well -- but the hair needs to be loosened from the fibers first . Help .... 
So off to grocery store--I'm not sure that it's a fun thing to do today but the sun is shining and the snow is on the ground -- what more could one want ? ;) * 
I'm pretty excited -- today I'm going to a Feldenkrais session -- and hopefully find a better way to deal with chronic pain . 
The nesselrode pies are done -- must be Christmas ! So sorry that < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > won't be here to enjoy them . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to you all . Getting the roast beast in the oven -- yum . 
Last day of Christmas vacation -- but I'll go into the office and clean , check the fax and mentally prepare to change back into \super nurse \".;)" 
How many does it take to change a light bulb in a high stairwell ? One human with a long handled bulb changer and 4 dogs to make sure you do it right ! 
Very strange night ! < PROPFEMALE > would have a \hey day\ " with all the dreams -- and I'm feeling like I never slept . < PROPFEMALE > and I will talk later . " 
Last night Harper brought a toy over to me -- a funny animal creature with rope legs . He wanted to \play\ " tug with me -- but from the look in his eye I knew he couldn't be allowed to win . He didn't--but I have very sore muscles from hanging on . Sometimes being < PROPFEMALE > is hard . " 
I'm nearly finished with the book Sleights of Mind ( or is it Sleight of Minds ? ) Anyone who loves the the interplay between psychology and neurology -- how our brain functions -- will love this book -- unless you don't want to know how magic tricks work . 
I like that I can touch , say hello to a few friend , and see my granddaughter . There are some good things about \social network\ " sites . " 
Life of the mudane -- four very dirty dogs now washed and dried . < PROPFEMALE > would like to go out and roll in something -- Please ! Whesties are not supposed to smell pretty ! 
So--I've been away from the computer this week -- lots of messages and stuff -- but I am here . 
The problem with the snow melt is that one is forced to go out and clean up dog poop -- and try to figure out why the dogs are so interested in the compost corner of the yard--didn't figure that one out , but presume that some critters may be coming out from hibernation -- like maybe garter snakes . 
I'm glad that < PROPFEMALE > went on her own -- as she was instructed to do . What a special special girl . : * 
How did so many people end up with Feb bd's ? Both my parents , < PROPFEMALE > , Dr , < PROPMALE > , lots of new babies born here this month the list goes on . ;) 
I'm finally getting to my computer -- some of you may want to know the babies that are to be born in June are BOYS ! <3<3 
We took < PROPMALE > to Sazon's for dinner -- our first visit there -- worth it , but sadly , no vegetarian fare . ;) 
< PROPMALE > is on his way back home . I will miss him -- but < PROPFEMALE > will really miss him the most . :'( : * : * 
There's nothing quite like waking up with the bed vibrating because Harper is having a seizure -- and then also realizing that < PROPFEMALE > is \dreaming of running after bunnies\ " and she is running in place . :-/ " 
Beer , but it's not recognized . : * 
So after running the hounds this morning I slept all afternoon -- guess I needed the rest . 
This wasn't snow that I removed tonight -- it was white rain -- very heavy . 
If I could figure out how to Paste something it would be a lot easier to share this very important message : Tip of the day : Rather than using a shampoo in the shower that adds extra volume and body try < PROPFEMALE > Detergent which dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove . ( thanks < PROPFEMALE > , and then < PROPMALE >...) 
I love the snow -- but it was so wonderful to be out running the dogs in sunshine today ! 
Wow -- I awoke to all the news about a tsunami about to hit -- but it looks like it has slowed -- if one hits SF area I know that < PROPMALE > will have a good view from is office window . 
< PROPFEMALE > scared me yesterday by having trouble moving her hind end -- as when she had her spinal injury . Today she is running and barking at the wind -- her usual self . 
Just a reminder -- turn your clocks forward ... and lose sleep for several days . 
What an absolutely glorious day -- too bad I'm not doing some gardening ! 
Today is as dreary as yesterday was beautiful . 
Sometimes Google is just too funny . I want to see what's out there to change the contour of the church pew so that I don't have this knife pain in my hip . I know how to stretch , I know therapies that are working , I know more than I care to know -- but Google has brought up every scheme available including How to find a Church . Gaia does have a seat that reminds me of the toy we bought for < PROPFEMALE > . 
Thanks -- the dogs and I needed that . 
Good morning ! 
Good-bye < PROPFIRST > . You are already missed . 
I did a \spring\ " walk thru of my garden . I don't think my roses made i t--t hey look pretty sad-but it's early . Many of my garden goodies look great . It helps that I've been planting native varieties . " 
... and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever ...
