Greatest man in history , named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master . Had no degree , yet they called him Teacher . Had no medicine , yet they called him Healer . He had no army , yet kings feared Him . He won no military battles , yet He conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today .

Why do we sleep through church But stay awake for a 3 hour movie ? Why is it hard to pray ? But so easy to cuss ? Why is it so hard to repost a Godly bulletin but easy to repost the mean ones ?? Why can people worship a celebrity but not God ? Gonna ignore this ? Afraid to get laughed at ? I bet 80% of you won’t repost this ....... The Lord said If you deny me in front of your friends I will deny you in front of My Father
