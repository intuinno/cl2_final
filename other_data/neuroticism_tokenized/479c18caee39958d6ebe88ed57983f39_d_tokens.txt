I have just learned the simplest and yet most profound lesson of my life . \Let God be God\ " I don't know why i fought it for so long but God has shown me that He has all of the world in his hands . I don't need to fear for the futur for He is GOD ! " 
my God is an awsome God . he is always there and when the night seems to be the darkest his light shines just on the horizon . my God is a God of miracles !!! 
Then sings my soul , \ 
my Savior God to thee\ 
How great thou < PROPMALE > \ 
How great thou < PROPMALE > . 
\For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die . \ " - Romans 5:7 " 
When I start to feel like God has forsaken me all I have to do is read Romans 8:35 -39 and see that nothing can seperate me from the love of God . I am never alone even in my darkest hour I know God is right there with me . I know that , even though I may not be able to see or even feel him , he will never leave me nor forsake me and nothing of this world nor any devil in Hell can seperate me from the love of God !!! 
I have to constanly thank God for the good people he has put in my life .... all of you know who you are I love you all 
LA LA LA LA LA LA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
How many years will I\

1 little 2 little 3 little dead little stupid people\ 
4 little 5 little 6 little dead little stupid people\ 
7 little 8 little 9 little dead little stupid people \ 
10 little stupid people are DEAD ......... my mind is not kid friendly 
Finally the hills are without eyes\ 
They are tired of painting a dead man's face red \ 
With their own blood\ 
\ 
They used to love having so much to lose\ 
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins 
ok thats it . now EVERYONE DIES !!!! 
Today may be the happiest day of my life ...... 
this may be the happiest day of my life ....... 
already 4 inches of snow ..... in Mississippi ... whoda thunk it
