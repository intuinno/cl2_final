Cleaning my nasty room , eating old < PROPFIRST>'s fries , drinking PBR , and listenin ' to Morning < PROPFEMALE > and Choking Victim while ignoring my immense need for a shower . 
I just had a dream about shooting a bunch of cops with a Raffica , stealing one of their cars , finding a HUGE stash of weapons in the car , and driving 100 mph down the interstate , and somehow one cop got onto the car and was holding on to the window while I was driving trying to get in , and I found a shotgun and killed him while driving .
