\All my atrocities come by way of reciprocity . I'm chewing the bones of my own reprieve . \ " Beauty of Annihilation-Elena Siegman " 
I guess I've just gotta give it some more time . Oh well , It's worth the wait , I'm sure =p

I can't help but wonder if she knows how much I like her ... 
< PROPFEMALE > is a virtue 
Maybe Monday willl be better =p 
I'm gonna sleep in sooo late 2maro =] 
I'm bored 
Omfg the one day i wanna sleep in , the loudest plane in the history of the world has to circle around above the airport down the road -.- 
Somebody really needs to get up and talk to me xD I'm bored 
\And I knew you could never love me . I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach . But can I still keep a place in your heart\ " Silverstein =p " 
Listening to \The End\ " by Silverstein . Awesome song =] " 
No shirt . No shoes . No worries =]

Leftovers+ Dr. Pepper+TV = Very Happy Kaleb =]

Uncharted Two <3 
Why do I always feel like I'm gonna pass out from exhaustion around 8:30 ?! -.- I really piss myself off sometimes 
My computer keeps f-ing up -.- 
I want bacon =] 
Mmmmmm frosted flakes and coffee =] 
frosted flakes+a cup of coffee = Awesome =p 
Chronicles of Riddick ?! Heck Yea =] 
I'm hungry D= 
This sucks =[ 
Have you ever listened to a song that makes you so incredibly hyper you just want to run around , take pictures , talk to everyone , and bounce off all the walls ? That makes you forget about all your problems and worries ? 
Tommorow I swear , I'll get this right . 
Haha I just added TruthBox on facebook ! xD 
Tomorrow's gonna be good day =] 
Hahaha Fun time ? I do believe so . Bye 
Why do I keep logging back on here ?! xD I must be addicted 
In situations like this its best to think purely in < PROPFIRST > . There's a pattern to everything , you just need the will to dig deep enough to find it . Life is really nothing more than a well though out equation , and to every equation , there's a solution . 
It's raining ..... 
My left hands warm , but my right hand feels like ice . Why ? 
I can't stop shaking =[ 
My ears feel like they're on fire =D lmao 
It feels like someones punched me in the throat , kicked me in the back , and stabbed me in the chest . I'm gonna go try and eat , hopefully I can hold it down . Why did I even go to school , anyways ? 
I can't believe that even after all these years , the first Panic ! at the Disco album can still cheer me up no matter what . Wierd , I know . lol 
We can't always get what we want , I guess . 
What should I do ?! -.- I hate getting stuck in situations like this 
Still can't stomach anything =[ 
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
Today is not going to be a good day xD 
You follow the rules . Why ? You obey those who believe they have power over us . Why ? To them you're a saint . To me your just pathetic . A waste of precious oxygen . But then again , most people are , aren't they ? 
Just got home . I guess today wasn't too bad . Chorus was pretty fun =] 
\I'm sorry I painted your mouth red . \ " \ " I'm sorry I painted your mouth blue . \ " \ " Wanna make purple ? \ " LMAO ! " 
I wonder what kind of parent I'm gonna be like when I grow up .... If I'm fortunate enough to ever have kids xD I'm probably gonna be the worst dad ever =p 
Tired . Gonna make some Ramen then probably go to bed =p 
Oh ... my .... god ..... I want a Manwich !!!! D= 
I think I'm gonna go to bed . Goodnight :3 
Just woke up . I'm tired D= 
Spaghetti for breakfast ?! Heck yea >=] 
Gotta find my cufflinks and buttons for chorus . hope the dry cleaners doesnt have them xD 
Getting satellite in two weeks ^-^ 
Found my Scrubs from State competition last year xD 
\The world is destined to descend into greater chaos \"" 
Mmmmm chicken =] 
I all of a sudden want to watch inglorious basterd ... 
Christams concert is gonna be awesome =p 
I wish I could find a video of the men's ensemble during the cool school thing last year -.- 
Taking a shower , going to walmart , then im gonna sit on my lazy *** for the rest of the day xD 
Maybe I'll go dye my hair again ? Maybe I'll grow it out brown ? Maybe I'll get a crew cut like my cousin is DYING to see ? ( Nah , I don't think so =p Maybe next year ^-^ ) 
OK so i bled all over my chorus shirt from last year and my jeans . wonderful -.- 
Eh I'm gonna dye my hair again , simply because I'm bored xD 
About to dye my hair . Listening to The Postal Service >=] 
Maybe I should do that homework for mrs sweeney's class so I dont fail -.- 
I'm surrounded by incompetent , worthless pests . 
You say growing up means understanding how the world works , I say growing up means admitting that you'll never really understand . 
Bed . Will tomorrow be a fun day or a boring day ? I'm still making up my mind 
School soon -.- 
Bout to bake a pizza =p 
Just talking to her makes my days better =] 
Probably gonna go to sleep . I'm unbelievably tired x_x Goodnight =] 
\Will someone please call a surgeon who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart that your deserting for better company \"" 
Goodnight people =p 
The difference IS drinkability xD 
Taking things slow is a lot nicer than I thought it would be =p 
I'm really pissed off . I'm gonna get 4 hours of detention Thursday because I lost every one of those button things . The first time I've lost anything for my tux , and it's the first time she ever gives detention for not having anything . It's bullshit -.- 
Good night 
Getting ready for the concert =p 
Just got back from the christmas concert . Making pizza >=] 
=] 
Silence , I say ! xD 
I woke up at exactly six -.- 
Nothing to do , nothing to do ... 
Getting off for a while 
Yes ! The satellite guy is here to put the dish up . I'm gonna have Direct TV ^-^ Now the only reason I'll ever have to leave my room is to go get food ! Unless .... I buy a mini fridge and microwave with christmas money ! >=] Hello , ability to be a hermit xD 
I wouldn't change how I act for just anybody , even if it is a change for the better 
\Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains\ " ~ Fight Club >=] " 
Going to the rec >=] Be back later 
Back from the rec center =p 
If I knew that Metalocalypse came on at 6:30 am , I'd be up this early everyday ! xD 
Playing C.O.D. World at War >=] 
Yea !!! < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > !!! >=] 
Really tired lol . Going to sleep =p Goodnight ^-^ 
Dust to dust , ashes to ashes . 
I knew I had heard that song before ! It's the Soul Eater theme =] 
Goodnight 
And now I can't get that song out of my head -.- 
Going to watch soul eater =p 
Goodnight =/ 
Today is going to suck -.-* 
=/ Sometimes people here are so confusing . 
be back later =p 
Going to watch the plays at school today . Then I'm probably gonna sit around and play C.O.D. Modern Warfare for the rest of the day >=] 
Maybe I'll try out schools in < PROPFEMALE > next year .... 
There are so many thing I would have changed for her . It would have taken a lot of effort , but I would be a better person for it . Now I don't have to worry about it >=] Yay optimism ^-^ 
I'm just not gonna try any more . Dating just isn't my thing , I guess . 
Why does stuff like this always happen right before a break ?! There's nothing worse than being in a crappy mood and knowing that there isn't going to be any sort of distraction anytime soon . 
Thinking about asking to go to the basketball game tonight . It depends on who's going , I guess 
So what happened to her liking me ? I am so tired of people lying -.-* 
I need a distraction . Staying on facebook all day isn't really doing anything to calm me down . 
Sleep is my escape . Goodnight 
Gonna leave for < PROPFEMALE > soon . Text me 
I think I'm gonna go back to straightening my hair every morning again . Sitting around with an extra half hour before school every morning was boring xD 
I only have 3 Gigs of music ? WEAK -.-* I need more . Anyone care to suggest some decent bands ? 
Going to Best Buy too see if I can get a graphics card for my laptop today ^-^ 
I installed some $80 dollar anti-virus onto my laptop . It works great , but now my laptop take anywhere from 3-5 to log onto a profile -.-* 
Owl City = the biggest waste of time , money , and oxygen ever put on this earth . If I have to listen to my sister play that stuff over the stereo for one more minute and I'm commiting seppuku . 
Just gonna kick back and relax until I fall asleep =p Talk to you guys 2maro 
Had some crazy nightmares last night xD 
Haha . Since I'm an hour ahead of you loser's back in TN , Christmas is an hour earlier for me >=D Pwnd 
Getting my hair cut saturday hopefully . Probably dying it brown =P 
Little sister = Imbecile . 
Almost done with 07-Ghost :D I love this anime . 
HOW DID WE MEET ? Everyone play this game ! Copy and paste this phrase on your profile , you will find it amusing to remember how you met and how you know each of your friends !! Before you do that , answer for me ...... PLEASE participate 
Sleepy . Goodnight , I think . Hopefully I can sleep xD 
Back from school . It was a pretty good day , up until chorus . 
Ok so < PROPFEMALE > and I have a bet going . She bets $50 I'll get a girlfriend and fall in love with her before my next birthday , I bet $50 it's not going to happen . XD 
Why are thoughts of her still eating away at me ? Forget this . Goodnight 
I forgive to much and I forget to often . I hate no person . I hold no grudges . I'm too nice of a guy and it always comes around to bite me in the ass . But Hell , I'd rather be miserable and have a clear conscience , I guess . 
Watching anime that isn't dubbed is a pain in the ass -.-* but totally worth it =D 
Cold , Hungry , Tired . 
No , I will not act happy because we have no school tomorrow . You know why ? Because I couldn't give a fuck less if we do or don't have school . 
Ok I'm going to try and stop cursing again XD And I actually plan on doing it this time ! lol 
Needs some fresh air . Be back later . 
I would have liked to lay down in the grass and look at the stars , but you can't see them tonight =/// 
I seem to be getting more and more pathetic every day . Goodnight . 
I wish a certain cousin of mine would get on Call of Duty : Modern Warfare already ** hint hint ** lol 
I need more anime to watch D= Any recommendations ? Ive already watched Soul Eater , Fullmetal Alchemist , < PROPFEMALE > Blood , Death Note , and a couple more animes . I need more ! =D 
Wolfs Rain !!! <3 I haven't seen this anime in years !!!!! 
Gonna listen to music until I pass out . Goodnight 
Nevermind . My cousin wants to play COD , and of course , its Call of Duty , so I must oblige >=] 
Bloc Party >=] 
I need techno . Good techno . Any suggestions ? 
Gonna start watching Bleach in a few =p 
6 more months until I get paid >=] ** hint hint < PROPFEMALE > ** 
My room smells like Ramen and insence ..... Interesting >=] 
Awesome night =] 
Artificial sweetener ?! I'd rather burn in Hell >=[ 
It's a pain when you have the urge to update your status , but you can't figure out what to say . Everything I think of is just so ..... hurtful >=] 
My true thoughts are probably a little too harsh for you all , so I think I'll leave you with a simple \Goodnight \"" 
Hungry and itchin ' to blow sh*t up >=D 
Lmao < PROPMALE > used his mind powers to give me a gushing nosebleed , it only took 3 hours for it to kick in XD 
Gonna go take a shower . Gotta wash all this blood off my hands and my face XD 
This town is overflowing with whores . No offense =P 
Gonna go sync my Zune with my laptop then I'm gonna try to get some sleep . I'm tired of being exhausted all the time . 
\Put instant concrete in your brother's waterbed\ " LMAO " 
Oh ... it's Friday ? Ehhh I don't really care , it's not like I ever do anything on the weekends anyways . 
Who needs 30 round mags ? With a 700 Nitro Express , just one of shot will take down anything you want . Be it a coyote , an elephant , or a commercial airliner XD 
Going to try and go to bed 
HAHA !! I managed to sleep for 12 hours just by sheer willpower XD I had some freaking crazy dreams though . 
\Shall I compare your lips to a pelican flapping in the wind . \ " XD Priceless " 
Gonna go listen to music until I fall asleep . Goodnight 
Should I watch more Bleach , or go play Modern Warfare 2 ? I mean , Bleach is good and all , but I'm kind of in the mood to make believe I'm killing people XD 
After I finish all the released episodes of Bleach , I think I'm gonna start watching Rurouni Kenshin again . 
Sweetarts <3 
I changed my mind . After I finish Bleach ( or get tired of it ) I'm going to finish Code Geass R2 . There's nothing like an anime about a mad genius using the pawns at his disposal to destroy his own country for the evils it has commited >=] 
She moved to Lewisburg ! =D ^-^ 
Had a decent day . Aside from the fact that everyone felt the need to be even more annoying than usual 
Combining Sirens and Vampires ? I have to admit , I'd have never thought of that . The people making Bleach sure are creative XD 
Missing so many bandages -.-* 
All done =] 
goodnight 
I'm dissapointed with a 25% accuracy in MW2 . Now I've gotta spend all week getting it up -.-* 
woot went up . 20% in one match =D I'm such a nerd XD 
I love tornadoes >=D 
Fuck this . I'm going to bed before I say anything else to hurt somebody . 
Can't sleep -.- 
Watching the hangover 
School -.-* 
Gonna go watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas again later . =p After talking about it all day , I'm just itching to watch it again XD 
\Wear some golf shoes ! Otherwise we'll never get out of this place alive ! \ " XD " 
I guess I'll go to sleep . Goodnight 
Practice at 12:30 . Gotta practice everything , because I wanna go to < PROPMALE > this year =D 
Registering for DOW >=] 
Ugh I went to register for DoW , but ended up typing the wrong email -.- So now I have to wait until tomorrow and hope the account expires when it doesn't get activated so that I can use my real PSn name for the forums XD 
Ahh Highrise =] I am too good at this map for it to be legal =p 
If you've got ps3 , you should add me to your friends list =p ~ PSN : persona100 
I don't think I've been in a single match today on MW2 where the serve connection didn't time out or everyone was camping . I'm going to take a break before the game pisses me of the the point where i just snap the disc in two and throw it away . -.-* 
Why has my NAT type changed three times today ?! D= 
Just went 21-0 with an emergency airdrop , harrier strike , and chopper gunner . AND I got game winning kill =D Pwned 
\How could she be with a wretch like me ? I'm the broken shell of a man I never was . \"" 
Hmm straighten my hair .... or play MW2 for a while before school ..... I think Ima go with MW2 >=D 
Thinking 
Bose in-ear headphones + Five Finger Death Punch + Zune at < PROPMALE > volume = This odd ringing noise in my ears XD 
Now being peirced by hundreds of needles and then getting pumped full of hydrochloric acid , that is an interesting way to go . 
Don't want to go to school -.-* Oh well 
Hmm time for MW2 . Forget the WA2000 , I'm going back to the intervention . 
I seriously need to get a girlfriend . Being single is to boring XD 
Going to play MW@ . Maybe it'll calm me down a bit 
Who's going to see Straight No Chaser ? For one , I need a ride there . And I just want to know who all is going =p 
So ..... bored ... -.-* 
Going for a walk 
Took some pictures in the snow . My feet are frozen , but it was worth it . >=] 
Anyone with MW2 on Playstation 3 wanna do Team Deathmatch ? 
YES ! =D Found another Bleach site that DOESN'T use megavideo >=] 
Awww =[ Get halfway through an episode , an Ad pops up , have to reload the entire video >.> 
If I'm stuck in this house for one more day , I swear I'll develop cabin fever and start killing people , just like in \The Shining\ " . >.>" 
It's been so long since I last burnt an insence in my room . I had forgotten how wonderfull they were =] 
Cabin fever , here I come * starts murmering \red rum\ " to self * XD " 
Went from episode 75 to 91 in one day so far ... not bad , I guess . 
Tired of getting these freaking nosebleeds all the time -.- they're so inconvenient 
My eyes ..... THEY BURN !!! o . 0 I take it this is a sign I should stop playing COD for the day , but it's a sign I plan on ignoring . >=] 
Before I got to sleep tonight , I have to have 40% accuracy on MW2 >=] 
Life is a game , and what's the point to any game ? It's to win . But if you spend your entire life trying to win the game , you'll never have any time to enjoy it . Solution ? Don't worry about winning , because whether you win or lose , you will die in the end , and all your efforts will be for naught . 
There sure aren't a lot of people who do surveys on facebook , are there ? XD 
No school tomorrow either ?! >.> * Commits seppuku * 
I think I would play MW2 a lot more if it weren't for all the ten year olds with mics trying to talk shit -.- 
I know terminal like the back of my hand now >=] 
I tell myself I don't care about her , then I wonder if she still likes me ? I confuse myself sometimes >.> 
I kept waking up this morning like every five minutes . After like the fourth time i was just like \Why the hell do I keep waking up ?!? \ " And I looked around and realized that the alarm on my phone for school had been going off for the past hour XD " 
Had enough MW2 for now . Nazi zombies , here I come >=] 
You can go ofline on facebook chat without logging out of facebook ?! o . 0 So many people I don't have to bother with anymore ! XD 
So did everybody enjoy their 5 day weekend ? XD 
Is it sad that I've had a 6-pack of Ramen in a cup for like 2 months , but just now noticed ? XD 
I have Ramen . It is in a cup =D 
There wouldn't happen to be anybody out there looking to sell a PS3 would there ? I have a friend who wants to buy one . 
Okay Everyone !!! Go to UrbanDictionary.com, type your first name in the search box on the top , copy and paste this as your status . THEN post the definition of your name in the first comment below your status . 
Going to play MW2 until I leave for school =p 
Lasagna ?! * Nom Nom Nom * >=] Eesh yummeh in meh tummeh XD 
MW2 !!!! >=D 
Sitting around at home all the time is so boring >.> I really need to find an excuse to get out of the house . 
Just played a match at Afghan with a guy who went 3 0-0 . That dude's a beast 
I would like nothing more than to fall asleep right now . But I know that isn't going to happen . >.> 
I've only < PROPFEMALE > single for 3 or 4 months ? It feels like its < PROPFEMALE > n at least 6 . XD 
Had a pretty good day . Up until chorus , at least . It amazes me how they can fit so many annoying people in one room . 
Hopefully going to Ally's house tomorrow =] 
Awww yea . Rust with Ninja , Lightweight , And Marathon With Akimbo P90 >=] 
Feels like a school night . I am so out of it XD

Do you know how hard it is to make an idiots study guide to Anatomy and Physiology , while still keeping it accurate ?! Let me put it this way , I've been working on it for an hour and a half , and I'm only on the third < PROPFEMALE > of the 20 < PROPFEMALE > section over anatomy . I'm not even attempting to do Physiology today XD 
I'm bored >.> 
Wow I could seriously cry right now . My hardrive is corrupted , my laptop is a paper weight , I've lost everything I had on my laptop , and I can't find my windows xp boot disk so I can wipe the hard drive and start over again >.> 
I rwally wish she'd stop trying to hook me up with her sister >.> 
I'm thinking today could potentially be a very good day :P 
I'm back in this town for 10 minutes and I'm already tired of being here >.> Figures

I'm bored . People should text me :P Ask for my number :D 
I plan on sitting around all day obsessively listening to \The Unforgiven III\ " by Metallica . I really want to buy that album now XD " 
Guess who isn't going to school tomorrow ? Or the day after ? Or the day after \the day after\ " ?. Ahhh sucks for you guys . " 
I'm sleepeh x_x 
Kaleb is a dork . Kaleb is a hungry dork . Kaleb is a hungry dork whose life consists of sitting around and playing video games . What are yew ? :3 
Maybe more people would like you if you weren't constantly cloaked in that clever little persona of yours . ;D 
Today was ... ineresting , to say the least . Sucky Friday . And I get the feeling it'll be a terribly boring weekend >.> 
Time to move on and forget about it , I guess . Lol :P 
I've been single for six months , two days now . :3 
< PROPFEMALE > might be coming over today ? :3 
School tomorrow ? No thank yew >.> 
Some people are so obnoxious . 
The thought that you might have just been another waste of time makes me break out in a cold sweat . 
8 Days ? Seems like a lifetime . xD 
Something has got to change , life has officially become predictable . 
Listening to that song one more time , then going to bed . Have a good night , everyone . 
School today -.- 
About to go cut grass -.- Hopefully I can still get out of this town over the weekend , I'm going to be PISSED if I can't go anywhere because of the weather . 
Magic Man ? Real Life Colour ? I <3 it :D 
Chorus competition tomorrow . -.- 
Today is going to be uneventful . 
has come to realize all the old films < PROPFIRST > Depp was in are much better than his more recent ones . ( The Ninth Gate , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , Etc . ) 
Not as good a day as I had hoped . Oh wells :3 
Bad day ; Bad week . When will things get better ? Will I ever get what I want ? -_-* Oh wells , all my problems will resolve themselves in the end , I hope . Only thing I need to worry about is why I can't seem to sleep anymore . Dx 
Not the best day , or the best week . Concert was good , but not good enough to make up for all this bullshit -_- FML , for real . 
Of course , can't sleep . Didn't see that one coming ..... 
Have you ever noticed how effective reading Dr. Suess is for releiving stress ? Like , it's fucking ridiculous XD 
I'll bid you adeiu and leave it at that . 
Back from Chicago . I got some googling to do and some plans to make >;D 
\Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory . \ " ~ Albert Schweitzer . Well I guess I'm halfway there . ;D "

So you think I'm just a complete idiot ? My stab hand is getting thirsty >:D lmao 
Have I completely lost my ability to < PROPFEMALE > on a conversation , or do you just not want to talk to me anymore ? 
just lost the game ;D lmao 
LIKE THIS if I have ever made you smile , laugh or helped you at any point in your life . Make this your status andsee how many people you've made happy .? 
I don't care about anybody's lies or false promises anymore , they aren't worth my time or attention . All I want to do now is sit around and talk to my good friends , and then sleep XP 
Getting in touch with old friends is my favorite thing to do over summer ^-^ Takes my mind of off dating XD 
Leaving to spend 5 weeks with my dad tommorrow . Can't wait to get out of this boring town ^-^ 
Has some people to delete out of his cell phone :P My phonebook seems to be getting kind of full of people I never really talk to anymore XD 
And the boredom begins to set in ... >.>

Leaving for nationals tomorrow . Probably gonna get lost in the airport XD Ready to bomb the written test , then chill around disney world eating pizza for 5 days :3 Roflcopter XD 
[ Unpartitioned space ] \And Kaleb said ' Let there be partition'\ " * Install * :3 "

I want it sooo bad T.T

Maybe I should go to bed ? :P 
Okay , I just want to get the opinion of the masses on this one . \ 
I think Kisuke Urahara is the most beast-mode character in Bleach , \ 
but my cousin disagrees , saying that Toshiro Hitsugaya is better and could kick Urahara's ass in a fight . \ 
I want to know what my fellow anime fans think . \ 
Keep in mind , nobody knows what Urahara's bankai is :3 \ 
GO ! XD 
Back to the classics . \ 
Gonan be watching < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hakusho and Rurouni Kenshin for the next few weeks :3 
I can understand being faithful to your religion , but it's rude to shove it down everybody's throats via facebook status or any other social networking site . I just thought I'd let you all know , because there seem to be quite a few people on here who don't understand that . I'm sorry if this status upsets anybody , but frankly , I couldn't care less . 
More < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > hakusho ! >:3 bwahahaha 
\You have watched 72 minutes of video today . Please wait 54 minutes or click * here * to enjoy unlimited viewing . \ " \ 
Well , that's 56 hours of my life I don't regret wasting on anime XD\ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hakusho could possibly be the best anime I've watched so far , which is surprising o.O I'm definately going to have to re-watch it someday . \ 
Next is either Rurouni Kenshin or < PROPMALE > X < PROPMALE > , not sure which :P 
Zoids ? I haven't so much as heard of this anime since I was a kid XD Gotta rewatch it for old time's sake :3 Bwahaha . Just finished s-CRY-ed . It was a decent enough anime , but the last episode was the only memorable one .

I'm not sure if I'm sleepy , or bored to the point where there's nothing better to do than go to bed XD 
< PROPFEMALE > Ware alyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssaalyssa XD it's harder to do it with your name because it starts and end with \A\ " . It makes my fingers confused o.O "

What's the first thing I'm gonna do when me and < PROPFEMALE > get to the mall ? \ 
Go buy some chinese food and a Dr. Pepper >:D lmao XD 
\Gaming is having a ridiculously huge TV in a < PROPFEMALE > one-room apartment . It's staying up until 3 a.m. to win a trophy that isn't real ... but is . \ " ~ Sony's < PROPFIRST > Butler ( a.k.a. < PROPFIRST > Lambert ); E3 Gaming Convention ^-^ " 
I'm kinda sleepy , but my brain tells me I should stay up . It says something interesting will happen tonight . O_o 
\The worst thing you can be is \ 
\The Bird and the Worm\ " is the only good song I've ever heard from \ " The Used\ " XD Do they have anything else that sounds remotely similar to that ? O.o " 
Finally fixing my laptop XD I don't plan on taking these drivers off my usb drive anytime soon XD 
I have officially been forced to start hiding people from my news feed to keep from posting smart-ass replies to their stupid-ass statuses XD 
You know , it really pisses me off when I see some sex-obsessed guy or some whorey , attention craved chick ruining every good thing they've got going for them . You immature brats make me sick . 
That AMV really made me want to get back into Bleach XD 
What is with everybody asking me for hugs lately ?! XD Did I really used to hug people that much last year ? o.O 
\We fear not our mortality . We'll serve to the best of our ability . We give our lives to our masters . We vow to smite all enemies . \ " XD Gotta love Dethklok . " 
Going to that football thing tonight to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > for a while :P Maybe going to < PROPFIRST > Case's house Saturday , maybe ? Nothing to do Sunday , I'm probably just gonna play video games . There you have it , my weekend in a nutshell . XD 
Good Day ^-^ 
Is on the internet . \ 
On my laptop . \ 
Hell yes . >:D \ 
By the way , my Uncle < PROPFIRST > has the best call waiting tone ever XD It reminds me of Crash Bandicoot . 
Nothing wakes me up quite like blasting \Inertiatic Esp\ " By The Mars Volta every morning >:3 " 
School >.> \ 
But then I get to come home and try out Kubuntu , maybe even download Linux . >:D \ 
It shall be epic . 
\Do not watch Code Geass . \ " \ 
Since I got home from school , I've been sitting around trying to think of something to do . \ 
Well I just now thought to play Demon's Souls . \ 
>.> * facepalm * 
\I never want to leave when I do . I never want to leave when I do . Every time I leave 
So , what ? \ 
Resident Evil : Afterlife = RE5 ? 
Going over to < PROPFIRST>'s today ^-^ Woot 
Just got back from < PROPFIRST>'s house . \ 
I had fun ^-^ 
Nose\ 
Is\ 
Stuffy\ 
>.< 
Every time I watch X-Play , I get the insatiable need to drop hundreds of dollars at Gamestop . XD 
Oh my god , new Metroid game ? More Rage reviews ? \ 
If I don't stop watching this show , I'm going to have a seizure from getting my mind blown too often . 
I was like \Take this 
Really wants a dr. pepper o.O 
Guild Wars 2 Necromancer : Totally gonna pown the rangers . Hear that < PROPFIRST > Savage Wark ? XD 
What should I have for breakfast , a red bull or a dr. pepper ? Decisions decisions ... XD 
Anybody know what time the game should be over tonight ? :P 
4 months until \Rage\ " <3 " 
Old < PROPMALE > Doran : \Ooh I can shoot magic beams from my Soulbrandt 
Just beat Demon's Souls . I could not be more satisfied xD Now time for NG+ 
Hates invading black phantoms . They all die in two hits and all they do is whiten my character tendency . What a waste , weak players . 
I repeat , Black Phantoms are a waste of my time on Demon's Souls . Northern Regalia+Pure Black Character Tendency = 540 damage per hit . That's a whole case of whoop ass right there . 
Eh , decent day . I can't wait for tomorrow ^-^ 
thinks hits hilarious when people who have only been dating a week or less go around saying they love each other . Bwahaha , freaking idiots . 
Sexy time ;D \ 
Bwahahaha , just kidding . But I do have chinese food . It's in my tummy . Nom Nom Nom :3 
will be the < PROPFIRST > of this poke war , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Case >:D 
\It is only natural for a butler of the Phantomhives to be able to do that . \ " ^-^ " 
Just finished season one of Kuro :D \ 
I wanted to see Sebastians demon form though o.O I was so looking forward too is , and all I get is a crooked smile from the shadows and a quick glimpse of some black stilettos >.< They can do better than that . 
is one hell of a butler . 
hasn't been able to stop listening to Vivaldi's \Concerto for two Mandolins in G major\ " for like 3 days now XD " 
So this one is for the experienced chorus people I have added on here . Which would be better for your voice , pineapple juice or water with lemon juice ? Because I've read that both are good . 
Hmmm Subway * Nom Nom Nom * 
Giggity . 
Well , it's 10:30 , and I'm finally done with my English III mid-term . Now , if I fail this , somebody is going to get killed . >.< 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > Savage Wark for beating Medal of Honor already . Too bad he doesn't have internet to play online :P lmao 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s Excellent Adventure ? HELL YES ! Watching it >:D 
I will never ever buy Call of Duty : Black Ops , because they obviously stole that exploding RC car from Rage . Uncreative assholes . Wtf does an exploding RC car have to do with the cold war ? Nothing . 
I love muh new display pic :3 Eesh all Halloween-like and stuffz :P 
wants a Gameboy color and a Nintendo 64 . Oh the classics , how I miss them </3 
Sleepy Sleepy Sleepy . Gah , you wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a black , double breasted , six-button tailcoat like < PROPMALE>'s XD It's ridiculous 
T_T I'm so sorry Sebby . 
XD Why did I just enter a contest to win a free xbox and assasin's creed , brotherhood ? \ 
Hell , idk . Maybe I wanna smash an xbox or something . XD 
Arsenic treats cancer ? Giggity . 
now I just gotta print some pictures out and throw them on a poster board , then I'm done :P 
My printer : Surprise , little < PROPMALE > . I know I told you I only needed one new ink cartridge earlier today , but now that it's FUCKING MIDNIGHT and you have NO WAY OF GOING OUT TO BUY INK , I'm just gonna go ahead and let you know that I'm out of another ink cartridge . And I know that you don't even need some stupid light blue to print your black and white paper , but I'm not gonna let you print anyways . 
Tuxedo man , tuxedo man , does whatever a tuxedo can . ( Not really , wearing a tuxedo kinda restricts you range of motion ) ( But it's still awesome ) ( Yes , I'm a total dork ) ( But I'm a dork with a tuxedo ) ^-^ 
\Why ? What's up ? \ " XD * hide all posts from this user * done . " 
\To Drink or not to Drink . That is the question . Drink Dr Pepper . That is the answer . \ " \ 
Q : Is this question thing completely pointless ? \ 
A : Yes , yes it is . \ 
Q : Does it get annoying having you news feed cluttered with this pointless stuff ? \ 
A : Yes , yes it does . \ 
Q : What are you going to do about it ? \ 
A : Block every one of my friends status updates until my news feed is blank , thank you . Goodbye . 
\I'd be a bitch too if I looked that much like a < PROPFEMALE > white monkey . \ " XD " 
I'm not very happy about Black Ops ripping off Rage , but I have to admit that it has the best campaign mode and the best soundtrack of any war themed shooter game I have ever played , and I've played most of them . XD 
You know , I hope the world ends in 2012 , and I hope it ends by way of Zombie Apocalypse , just because it would be interesting .... 
How come every girl can publicly talk crap about guys as a whole , but if any guy says something publicly about girls as a whole , he gets bombarded with people calling him an ass for it ? I wish our society wasn't so sexist , and I wish chicks would get over themselves . Just because one or two guys cheated on you doesn't mean anything . More girls cheat on guys than vice versa anyways . 
I wish my Frosted Mini Wheats would sit on my shoulder and talk to me all day like they do to those kids in the commercials . D: 
Now : Evangelion\ 
Next : Maybe Soul Eater ? I miss that anime :3 
Demon's Souls was awesome when I first got it . \ 
Now it's even more amazing in HD ! >:D I love you HDMI cable , just for this :3 
\Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it 
I'm going to forge an axe out of hot steel ( with my bare hands , of course ) and chop down a tree using my manly muscles and my manly manliness , and then my mother can make me a fire in the fireplace :D lmao XD 
Anybody want to take me to the game before 6 so I can sing with the Men's Ensemble ? XD I don't take rides from creepers , though . 
Anybody want to talk or text or whatever ? XD I'm bored and not ready to go to bed yet . 
Maybe I should take my contact out before I forget I'm wearing it and go to sleep ? \ 
Nah , it'll never happen :3 
Just finished ordering < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Case ' s Christmas present :3 
Lame people \coughing\ " while they're trying to talk shit about somebody make me laugh . Bunch of pathetic dumbasses . XD " 
XD \I want to go to Yail . \ " \ 
Crash Bandicoot 3 ? Final Fantasy VII ? And both on my PS3 system so I can play them wherever I go ? HELL YEA ! >:D 
I do believe I am going to re-watch Soul Eater now . >:D 
Am I the only teenage in Tennessee that DIDN'T make a snowman today ? XD 
Why is it every time I'm doing horrible at Black Ops , my internet connection is fine , but EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm going like 25-3 half-way through a match , my internet kicks me off and I get nothing for it T-T . 
Just beat Demon's Souls again . Now for play through number 3 ! :D God I love this game . XD 
Wow , playthrough number 3 was easy . I wonder if number 4 will be any harder ? XD Platinum Trophy , here I come . 
Uncharted 3 ? Portal 2 ? Rage ? Oh , it's gonna be a good year . :D 
Anybody doing dual enrollment wanna give me a ride Tuesday and Thursday ? I don't get my license until Friday >.< 
DR . PEPPER :D 
I want a Sony 3D tv just so I can play Uncharted 3 in 3D , then I'll throw the tv away XD 
I miss Der Reise ! T-T I want World at War back D: 
I wish they would just cancel school . Not because I don't want to go , but because I don't want to listen to everybody complain about how we didn't get out because of a little snow . >.< 
Anybody know how to disassemble a cheap pocket watch ? I want to tweak mine a bit but I can't get the winding mechanism loose . 
Sony NGP : I want it :D ~ 
Fortune cookie with no fortune ?! Damn you < PROPFEMALE > Wok !!!!!!! XD 
Got my license * Woo * Uhhhh , what now ? XD 
1 ) Mow the lawn\ 
2 ) Wash and wax the truck\ 
3 ) Do all my Psychology homework so I don't fail :3 \ 
If < PROPFIRST > didn't have my Playstation 3 for the time being , none of this would be possible XD 
< PROPFEMALE > Bali Gallup Smith Did you know the orchid was blooming ? o.O 
Starting to pack for HOSA :D 
I need something awesome to do while I wait for my laundry to be done .. >.< 
So all-in-all , I only got my boots , dress shoes , and converse packed today Dx 
HOSA Competition was awesome , aside from the whole getting sick and not placing thing XD But oh well , there's always next year :3 I just hope < PROPFEMALE > Demumbreum doesn't fall and hurt herself before the next one XD Chorus Competition tomorrow . It should be interesting , considering I can't breath through my nose and sound like a 12 year old when I try to sing . Woo :D 
1 ) Study for Spanish\ 
2 ) Study for Psychology\ 
3 ) SLEEP T.T 
Lmao I have 50 friends news feeds blocked XD 
Listening to Vivaldi while I put all my old music on my new laptop ? Awesome :D 
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ?! Yes :D 
\Monday got you down ? Pepper up . \ " ~ Dr Pepper page . \ 
Creeper status would be so much more easily achieved if I could wink . :( I will never be able to unlock the full potential of my creeper status , unfortunately . XD 
Hello . Yoda speaking , this is . Great big f**king idiot , you are . 
Soooo .... I now have the ability to practically tear appart the entire interior of my care ( minus the dash ) in about 30 minutes . And I still can't find the break in that speaker wire XD 
I am now enlisting the help of all you facebook-ers . Congratulations , you all work for me now . I currently have about $60.80 in store credit at Gamestop , and I'm looking for a good Action RPG on the PC with a high Replay value and good single player to buy . Multiplayer is a plus , but I couldn't care less if it has it or not . Anything comparable in gameplay and quality to Demon's Souls would be EXCELLENT . Any ideas ? 
Haircut tomorrow ? Haircut tomorrow . 
Playing Demon's Souls on new character ? Playing Demon's Souls on new character . 
Just got PS+ :D 
So apparently , I have the same personality type as < PROPFIRST > Hawking . XD 
Hmmm Psyc paper , seems easy enough ..... 
FINALLY got Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.10 dual booting . Go me :D 
Tylenol kicked in , I can't feel my sunburn whenever I lay down now . \ 
I'm going to bed before this wonderful drug wears off XD 
Kaleb shouldnt let people on his computer before he signs out :D haha stupid :P \ 
-ACD 
What to do .... What to do ....

\Why did you trip me ? \ " \
