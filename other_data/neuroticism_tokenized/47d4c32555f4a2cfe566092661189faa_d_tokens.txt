Sure I do . All the projects we did with the Follies and with < PROPFIRST > . Those were the days :) 

Glad the weekend is here , but it's SO hot outside !!! 
Just finished a voice over for Fox Network ( Hearing Conservation Training ) NOW my weekend's begun :) 
Wow , the high was 94 degrees today - it feels like winter :O 
Just finished going over the music for church tomorrow and now enjoying a Lindt chocolate toffee bar . The doggies are eyeing it , and giving me that , \if only we were bigger we'd kill you for it\ " look . " 
Played < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s piano arrangement of \I Must Tell Jesus\ " for the contemporary service offertory this morning . Nice going < PROPFIRST > ... we miss you ! " 
trying to find a sub organist to play for me when I'm off to see my Dad next month . < PROPMALE > has so few subs ! 
Just installed Digital Performer 7 on the Sound Room computer .... starting new tracks for November contemporary service ..... 
My younger < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ( in my pic to the left ) , was barking like crazy from the downstairs bathroom yesterday ... I thought we had a break-in or worse ! It was a < PROPFEMALE > house spider . Guess I can cancel my pest control service ....... 
... so glad this is Friday , but have Christmas cantata rehearsal at the church tomorrow morning ( Saturday ) at 8am ! We're doing Pepper Choplin's \I Hear the Prophet Callin'\ "" 
Today was my first day of full-time job vacation . So what did I do ? Spent 6 hours working on my par t-t ime church job . ' Tis the season ( ho ho ho ! ) 
Just got back from annual Session ( Presbyterian Church leadership group ) retreat at Camp < PROPFIRST > near Navasota , TX . Good workshop but yucky , muddy and rainy weather . Seems like it's been chilly and rainy for most of the \winter \"...." 
Final packing . Off to church , then to the sea . 
Just picked up the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > \terrors\ " from the kennel . It will be 4 hours of running back and forth with/without dog toys and chew bones . I think if I take the Benadryl things will seem calmer - it never works when I give it to them ... :| " 
Eating dinner and watching Vicar of Dibley . < PROPFIRST > Russells already eye-ing me for their walk . Then some work on New Psalm Sunday music . 
I woke up to a flat tire . A 1\ piece of metal was sideways in the middle of the tread . Got it fixed just before noon after a fight with the wienie car jack-o-joke Chevrolet ungraciously provided . This taunting piece of Chinese junk steel \ " facilitated\ " in putting on the toy tire .... :| WalMart charged me only $10.00 BUT it REALLY cost me over $60.00 after waiting for the repair and buying things in the store ! " 
Today was our 5th anniversary of moving to Texas . Tomorrow starts the 6th year . Man , time does fly ! 
Getting X-Rayed after a fall on concrete . Tore up my hand and sprained my forearm . Glad this happened AFTER Easter ! 
Bad news , doctor called from his house this evening and told me my elbow is fractured . He wants me to visit a specialist tomorrow . Verrry unhappy here :( 
Had a bad night with my arm , but a bit of shopping at the Apple Store brightened my spirits .. yes , tax refund :) Also contemplating a bottle of blueberry wine . I think that would be better than Vicodin .... 
Off to redeem my $90 worth of Reward Zone coupons at Best Buy ( joy ) 
3:40 am . Arm hurting , couldn't sleep .. oh well , there's the web and infomercials ... 
Finally got the cracked windshield replaced on my Malibu . Safelite came to the house and did a great job - inexpensive too . Wow , this sounds like a commercial ... 
At Bush Intercontinental awaiting flight to Seattle . 
In the air with Alaskan Airlines en route to Seattle . wifi enabled :) 
Getting ready to disembark off the ship . Then to the airport and a 4 1/2 hour flight home . Alaskan cruise was beautiful , but I think I still prefer the Caribbean . Not so COLD ! 
is at the Seattle-Tacoma airport . 4 hours until the flight home . Thank goodness for my iPad- besides I need to kill some more Zombies in \Plants vs Zombies \"" 
Another thunderstorm ... a humid , wet , not-quite-as-hot-as-usual July . At least things are green , lush and rampant :) 
is glad it's Friday . Been a busy week at work . Finished editing 4 video roll-ins for the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > telethon ( for CITGO ) . Looking forward to a laid-back weekend .... Where to go for dinner tonight ? Tricky decision with so many fabulous possibilities in < PROPMALE > . 
just finished browsing at Garden Ridge . Christmas displays are already up . 146 days to Christmas ! 
is at the doctors getting his annual physical . 
Pretty decent thunderstorm in < PROPFEMALE > . Very dark but still very hot . \ 
Sauna anyone ? 
Happy 10th birthday to my oldest grandson , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
Beautiful 80 degrees in < PROPFEMALE > this afternoon . You'd never know it was the first day of winter ! 
Coming home from Christmas dinner with friends from church . Fun time with great people - made a shoo fly pie for dessert - yum :)
