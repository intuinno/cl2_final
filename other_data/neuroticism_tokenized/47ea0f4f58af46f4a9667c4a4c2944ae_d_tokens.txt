I'm drunk 
I have the best taste in music . Thats not opinion just fact . 
Blue and white polka dots 
Contrary to popular belief , I am not a lush . . . I just take being 21 very seriously . 
I scared myself by reading The Shining . . . . This is sad . I haven't even finsihed it yet and I am already looking over my shoulder ever 5 minutes . 
I kicked a surfer at the dinner table because Big Bird said to and he's my leader . 
Damn eye infections . Hurt like crazy and I am stuck wearing glasses for atleast a week . 
I feel like I have been sleeping way too much . I need to get some motivation . . . I am sure sitting here on Facebook helps . 
I love my mom ! For all of you that aren't too proud to say thank you to your moms for helping you be the great person you are today ... please copy and paste to your profile ! I expect to see this many times on my < PROPFEMALE > ! Love You Mom !!! 
I just don't know what to say about last night . . . . 
Stayed up till 4 in the morning . . . Casino's trick you into thinking its always 9 o'clock at night . I am so tired . 
English tonight . . . I am sure it is going to be so much fun . . . 
I need to go to bed but I am wondering if it will ever happen . . . 
Today is going to suck ! 
Thank you everyone who wished me Happy Birthday !! I am pretty sure it should be made into a national holiday ! Thanks 
I think someone asked to be my friend and I may have rejected it . . . oops . . . Now if only I could figure out who it was haha 
Going to main street for my BDay . . . Everyone is invited !!! Yay ! Hope to see you there ! 
Going to Longhorn for my birthday dinner with the family . Yum ! 
Had an amazing birthday weekend , now I have to get back into work mode . No more drinking till at least next weekend 
Staying home with strep throat . 
Going to the grandparents to celebrate my cousin < PROPFIRST>'s birthday . I think I might be a little bit late . . . fashionably late . 
Someone needs to go get all that ice and snow off my car . . . I hate doing it ! 
Getting ready for bed . . . . Tomorrow is most likely going to suck . I hate working on Thursdays . Although thinking about the free drinks tomorrow night is always helpful ! 
Tonight is going to be great . Just have to wait on < PROPFIRST > . . . Hurry up < PROPFIRST > . 
Why is it that guys are incapable of making plans and sticking to them ?? 
Happy Valentines Day !!! Maybe next year I will have a boyfriend to share it with . haha 
Margaritas with < PROPFIRST > tonight !!!! Yay !!! oh and maybe < PROPMALE > . . . . yay . 
< PROPFEMALE > Monday !!! I love Monday nights !! I look forward to it every week to go < PROPFEMALE > out with my bestie < PROPFIRST > . Who also shares my passion for margaritas . 
I really really don't want to get my wisdom teeth pulled . 
So getting my teeth pulled was not bad at all . I am just waiting now to feel my mouth again . 
Me , Ditto , < PROPFIRST > and Boomer spent the day laying on the couch doing nothing . It was pretty nice except for the hangover from last night . Me and Jello shots do not get along . 
< PROPFEMALE > Monday !!! Best day of the week !! 
Finished with my paper for now I can't take anymore of Pip's Great Expectations . . . No one cares anyways 
I think I am addicted to margaritas . . . is that possible ? 
Went tanning and I am red . Very red . Like lobster red . It hurts . Alot ! 
Lost my phone last night at Fast Eddies . I am so mad at myself . Hopefully I can get it replaced today . 
so hopefully I will get my new phone tomorrow . . . I can't wait . I don't know how anyone lives without a phone . I feel so isolated . 
Got my phone !!!! Yay !!! 
Okay now I have no ones number so if you want to talk to me I guess you have to call me first !! lol this sucks 
I just want to say that Nyquil is awesome ! 
Just got back from Cape . Had a great time ! Now I am back to stressing about school and money . Yay . 
Half days at work are amazing ! It helps me get up in the morning . It would be better if it was on a day that I didn't have school that night . 
Wondering if vista is going to happen tonight . . . 
So today is all work . I start my new job tonight . . . . Right after my job at Commerce . I think I will need a 5 hr energy today . Luckily I got plenty of sleep . . . thanks < PROPFIRST > . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > tired . . . 
Half the time I wake up needing to give an apology . I hate that I don't wake up to my phone . 
So glad it is Sunday but I have so much to do before work . 
Where do teachers get the ideas for some of these assigned papers we are supposed to write ? Who would write 6 pages on a character eyes ? 
I am so happy that my boss let me leave to go to my great grandma's memorial service . It meant a lot to me and my family . It was nice to be there with the family . I bawled my eyes out listening to my grandma talk about my great grandma . 
Finally done with my paper !!! Woo hoo !! 
Finally finished my chapter summary . . . May have rushed the ending but atleast its done . 
Worse morning ever !!! 
Hopefully today will be much better than yesterday . 
So glad to get a little of sleep in . I needed it . 
Note to self . . . Make sure to log out of facebook before older sister comes and ruins life . 
I am so ready for tonight ! 
I survived the day !! I woke up with the worst headache but I still worked my 15 hours ! So proud of myself ! Go me ! 
Just got home from work and now I am getting to work on this paper . I am so happy classes are over . Now I can just work more ! Woo hoo !!!! This is not sarcasm actually . I really need the money haha 
just give me a cup and I'll figure out the rest ! Woo woo !! 
Margaritas tonight sound like a wonderful idea ! 
Last night was . . . interesting . Tonight is going to be awesome ! With < PROPFIRST > and J it usually is . 
Trouble sleeping . . . Atleast I don't have to wake up early . 
Going to go see my grandpa at St. Johns . He is hopefully going to keep getting better and maybe be more careful . I now know where I get my clumsy traits from . Thanks Grandpa !! Love you !! 
Working at theatre . . . Pretty flippin bored . I have so much energy yet I don't want to do anything . Having to work a midnight show kinda sucks but hopefully the money will be good . . . 
15 Hour work day today . . . This is beginning to exhaust me . Good news I only have one job to work tomorrow ! Can't wait ! 
I need lots of money and fast . . . without doing something illegal . Any ideas ? 
Drinking till 2 o'clock was fun but working at 10 is not . 
I just want less stress . . . Thats all . Just a little less . 
I am so so so ready for this weekend ! 
311 concert tomorrow !!! Woo woo !!! 
Working again till close . . . I just can't hold in my excitment . 
Working tonight till close at the theatre . . . . At least I got to sleep most of the day !! 
Don't break my heart and I won't punch you in the face !! 
Workin at the theatre woo woo !! 
Nobody likes me , everybody hates me , I'm gonna eat some worms , yum yum ! 
I want to go to Stockfest so people need to go with me !!! Who doesn't like drinking all weekend with a whole bunch of people who enjoy drinking as well ?? 
I want to go to Stockfest damnit ! Why are people not cooperating ?? 
I feel so horrible today . . . I meant to get so many things done and instead I slept . . . . damn hangovers ruin everything . And now I have to go into work . Atleast for once I don't close ! Yay ! 
All work and no play makes me grumpy 
Sometimes I just don't want believe I did some of the things I did . . . 
At Fairmont park . . . I am not lady luck tonight . 
Pretty depressed . I won't have my car back for at least a week . I hate not having my baby ! 
I need my car ! My life sucks without it ! 
Good news I could get my car back today or maybe tomorrow . Bad news , I am stuck at work till 6 . 
Crossing my fingers that I get that call that my car is done !!! 
I got my car back !! The world is right again ! 
I hate being emotional !!! 
I really don't want to go to work tonight ! 
I should not have energy right now . I have to be at work in like 8 hours !!! I just got done cleaning my room and doing laundry and I still don't want to go to bed ! 
Working tonight . . . . I just took a coma for about 4 hours so hopefully I won't hate working too bad . :) 
Just a reminder . . . All girls are crazy and all guys are assholes . . . Which makes me wonder if girls are crazy because guys are assholes or guys are assholes cause girls are crazy . . . Hmm . . . 
So I think I am getting sick . . . I am surprised I went this long without getting sick actually but I really was hoping it wouldn't happen at all . Working two jobs means I can't afford to get sick . 
Can't wait to get off work ! Going out tonight ! Probably shouldn't cause I don't feel the greatest but the point is that I need a night out ! 
I think I like Nyquil too much . It is now in best friend status . haha 
Not looking forward to working tonight . . . That voice that tells me I need money is getting harder to hear everyday I have to close the stupid popcorn popper . haha . 
Working . . . Its what I do . . . 
I am so glad that I don't have to work until noon today !!! I got off early from work last night and got to go home and play on the computer till 2 in the morning ! Awesome ! Been better if I was drinking but oh well it was still nice . 
I have started hiding people's status ' when all they can say is mushy crap about how life is wonderful and how they love whoever . . . I like my facebook to be slightly pessimistic and cold hearted thank you . :) 
Drinking margaritas ! Woo woo ! 
So I don't think I am going to do Habitat for Humanity again . . . 
Busy Busy Saturday . I need an assistant . . . Anyone want the job ? BTW I'm not gonna pay you but you would get to < PROPFEMALE > out with me that should be payment enough . 
Why can't people fit around my schedule ?? I mean the universe already revolves around me , people need to get with the damn program ! 
I ordered my costume ! Awesome ! 
Is it too much for a person to talk to someone atleast once everyday ? Is that not normal in relationships ? 
Let me try this again . I want ONLY people who are currently in a relationship that has lasted more than two weeks to answer . Do you talk to your significant other practically everyday ? 
There ain't no better joy than a big butted boy 
The drive was worth it ! Like usual . 
I am so bored ! I can't wait for this weekend ! I want to get the week over with ! I wish I could make a clone of me to work for me ! That would be awesome ! 
caramel crumb biscuit . . . Seriously ? Caramel on a biscuit ? 
Surprisingly happy tonight . Something is wrong Haha 
How is it that MY mom is always right ? Even on things she can't see for herself ?? Damnit if she says I told you so one more time I'm gonna start thinking she is psychic . 
I don't feel good at all !!! 
I want to sleep !! And I still have to make like 8 batches of jello shots . . . I am so done volunteering ! 
I'm late I'm late for a very important date no time to say hello goodbye I'm late I'm late 
Last night was super fun I can't believe all those jello shots got drank/ate ! I love my boss ! 
My tire is flat ! Happy Halloween ! 
I am fed up ! I may not be fucking perfect but I deserve a little bit more at the very least ! 
My sister is having a halloween party this saturday Nov 6th so if you are a friend of mine then you'll be there . I'm making jello shots !!! 
Its not when I'm mean to you that I don't like you . Its when I don't care enough to even talk to you enough to be mean when I don't like you . So quit taking it personally lol 
You are either awesome or you aren't . Oh by the way I'm awesome . Be jealous . Haha 
Just got done with the 150 jello shots . Everyone who wants one has to put on a costume and come over to my sisters house . Call me if you need directions . 
Oops . I accidentally got drunk last night . I don't know how that happened . 
I don't like karate people 
Working at the theatre . Think I'm gonna take half my kids to go see Megamind along with my mother . I'm the best person , I know . 
I wish I could attach your penis to someone I like more than you ! Haha I think this has crossed many a peoples thoughts before . 
This is gonna be fun ! 
< PROPFIRST > touched my boob and didn't even get me drunk first I feel cheated ! 
So I saw Skyline yesterday and it was ridiculous . There was no plot whatsoever ! Had fun afterwards though ! 
This sucks ! Plain and simple 
So tired ! It was worth staying out last night but I am definitely paying the price today . 
Papa Johns is awesome ! Bacon and cheese and then sausage and green peppers ! Yum ! 
You know why I love Vista Grande ?? They know I'm a < PROPFEMALE > and treat me like it ! 
My date last night was great I'm gonna be tired today . I have to work both jobs . Ugh 
My throat hurts ! I can't get sick ! 
Its amazing what a 24 hour coma will do for your body . I feel sooo much better ! 
Going to see chevelle , finger eleven , and hail the villain with < PROPMALE > ! 
Going to bed finally ! 
Working tonight . Can't wait to get off ! :) 
I realized that most guys are dumb and dumb guys are not worth my time . They are annoying as hell . 
My Christmas < PROPFEMALE > was stressful but I had fun . I got a new bed set from my awesome sister and a < PROPFEMALE > necklace from < PROPMALE > ! More than I was hoping for . 
Working till after midnight again and then opening at the bank tomorrow . . . I wish I could just work one job but at this point I don't think I could make it with one paycheck . :( wish I had more time for certain people . 
I'm at Vista Grande chillin with my homies 
hakuna matata !!! 
Damnit ! No one loves me !! 
I'm at Vista Grande ! Having fun with people who care . 
My hormones smell like fried chicken 
Last night was fun but this morning is not . 
< PROPFIRST > just said I have to pull it out and keep sucking . 
Drunk 
Play now I an smashed and high heels were a bad idea 
Thanks to everyone for the Happy Birthdays !! 
The bank should be closed !! 
Yay I get to get off work early !! 
I attempted to shovel the driveway this morning to get my car unstuck and let's just say it didn't go as planned . It was a lot harder than I thought . 
Last night . . . Bad decisions . Haha that's all I'm sayin . 
AH ! Believable-Vol . 1-\Ridiculous Speed Sign \"" 
Wow . Last night was crazy . I can't believe I was up till 530 in the morning ! 
I need some sleep ! 
I have a problem buying songs on iTunes when I drink . It's not healthy 
Beiber sucks . Sorry if you like him but yeah this movie is ruining my life .
