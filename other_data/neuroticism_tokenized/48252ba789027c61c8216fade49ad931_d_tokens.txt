Yes , Folks ! It's that time of the year again ! Mercury is in retrograde until the end of September starting today . So , my fellow gemini's ... prepare for communication break down , foiled plans and appointments ... and ecspecially plan on how you will deal with those inevitible arguments that come from the words you will be uttering ALL month , \I didn't hear you say that ... \ " Think I'll go hide in my cave now .

I caught myself laughing at the tide while rivers poured in , I watched myself fondling the waves with terrible secrecy questioning fates misdirection yet succumbing to all the pain it brings There is a third eye that stares to see A quiet voice whispering over me Omniscient voyager flickering the light A tired , mindless statue of servility I cannot wait to better comprehend The essence of this beginings blissful end

Zombieland was good ... the company was better . A great day/evening overall ... yesturday was crap ... That's another story . 
Was playing guitar at Baker Park enjoying some alone time and was suddenly surrounded by a mob of overly-excited homeless folk . Couldn't understand a goddam word , but the dancing told me they liked what they heard .

A friend asked me recently , \what is your safe word when you \"----- \ " yourself ......? \ " And I answered with a look of digust ; with sheer disdain ; with the most disrespectful shit-eating grin ever !

I wish I had 2 cents for every time I \think\ " I put my foot in my mouth ... might be able to by that private jet by now ... or maybe some gum ? Who knows ? "

I asked myself a question earlier ... and I still haven't answered myself . I hate that . The uncertainty of direction and the answers that come when they are least expected . Fates misdirection sure has a way of turning the straight and narrow into the long and curvy ...

The illusion of compliance is scary when applied to your every day life .

To me , boxing is like a ballet , except there's no music , no choreography and the dancers hit each other . 
Current Favorite Movie : How to Kill Your Neighbors Dog . So glad I stumbled into this one . 
If it wasn't for Facebook , I wouldn't have realized exactly how many things I actually DO NOT like ; and I'm now just clicks closer to determining the number of things I DO like ! Thanks FB , b/c of you , I know myself even better . Marketing genius ! 
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone ! Hope it is a memorable one ! I miss my family back at home and will have you all in mind ! 
As I have \ 
said before , I have learned a LOT about myself on Facebook . For \ 
instance , if I were a Disney < PROPFEMALE > I would be Pocahontas ; That I am \ 
69% stupid ; I would live through a Zombie Apocalypse ; I don't like \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and my friends have a lot of things to say about \ 
me on those quizzes , but I will never take the time to know what exactly they think .. 
Should I like a sponsored Facebook movie before I see it ? Hmmmmm .... Sometimes I want to like it b/c I like the actor or something , but seems like I would be skewing the statistical data . And everyone knows how much I HATE skewing statistical data ! 
I bet when the Neanderthal kids would make a snowman , someone would \ 
always end up saying , \Don't forget the thick 
Yep ... I'm going to the Saints and Ravens game care of Father < PROPFIRST > Brocata , my newest best friend ! 
You know what would make a good story ? Something about a clown who make people happy , but inside he's real sad . Also , he has severe diarrhea . 
????? ?? ? ???? everything ??? ????? is ????? ???? ???? fine ???? ??? ? ?????? love . ????? ??????? ??? your ????? ???? government . 
If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy , which one would you think liked dolphins the most ? I'd say Flippy , wouldn't you ? You'd be wrong , though . It's Hambone . 
I didn't know it then , but looking back , in hindsight , I realize that when I was younger I could see into the future . Now I'm getting all my premonitions as flashbacks ...

< PROPMALE > Wolf ... what a mind this man has ... first , Miami Vice . Then he brings us Law and Order . And how could one not like that name ? IN the phone book he is Wolf , < PROPMALE > . You go Wolf < PROPMALE > . 
How could a team win when they have 4 ( FOUR ) hurt starting running backs ? Great year ! Saints live to fight another one . 
The other day , I was walking my dog around my building -- on the ledge .... Some people are afraid of heights . Not me . I'm afraid of widths . 
Straight Is the New Gay 
If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your horse , I bet it would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was reading a magazine .

But it was a blast , and we hope to be invited back ! This Tuesday at U Street Music Hall and FEB 11th at Capital Crave ! C U there ! 
The White Stripes have disbanded . I guess that makes them both an individual white stripe . Two separate stripes . Or is < PROPFEMALE > only half of a stripe ? Hmmm 
Whenever I'm trying to sleep and I hear that dog barking down the street in the middle of the night I cannot help but to think how much better it would sound if it were a statue . 
If I were a lethal killing machine I would choose to be an assassin ... Assassins do it from behind .

I would like my Facebook friends to comment on this status , sharing how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right , just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status , so I can do the same . I bet half won't read the instructions right .

After my meeting today , it appears I may be inheriting a new nickname . Doodlebug . Apparently I was shaking one of the tables with my shading ... I'm in between on the whole thing , obviously ... 
I tried to walk into Target , but I missed . I think the entrance to Target should have people splattered all around . 
If you have not yet seen , The Science of Sleep yet ... DO IT 
Sometimes I find myself staring through the eyes of my shadow ; seeing all who want give up as perfect refractions of self-imposed inner thoughts . It's too late to give up and too early to give in . Find your own perfect peace within the solidarity of your bleeding pen . Speak it's words , sing it's song , I promise you will share in a unity that will elevate your consciousness and cast a light on all that is dark . ~ CMS
