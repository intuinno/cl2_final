I AM GOING TO KILL THIS M ----- F ------ CAT !!!! He has SHIT on my artwork ! He has literally left a huge stinking ass pile on top of it ! It is like he has had a personal vendetta against me since I moved in over here ! What pisses me off even more is that as I woke up and caught him in the act , he runs like a scaredy cat and finishes in the litter box !!!!! 
Well my car rolled over and died today .... the crack in the head gasket blew open again . Looks like I'm going to be getting a new car soon ya'll! 
I'm making cascarones today ! =)

I hate my life 
These headaches have got to stop .... seriously . >.<

Okay , I'm thinking it's about time I see a doctor about these headaches before I go crazy . >.< I'm convinced they're stess related . 
is tired 
necesita < PROPFEMALE > escape de < PROPFEMALE > . 
You know I might actually play farmville more if I could do anything without having to reload all the time . I'm so sick of out of sync errors after you have harvested your crops , trees or animals . ERROR ! Reload the < PROPFEMALE > and it turns out that you haven't done anything at all ! Yay ! I'd also like to be able to click on my buildings to harvest without having to reload the < PROPFEMALE > because the game decided to \freeze\ " on me . " 
Dear LORD give me the strength of mind to find some separation from my family because if I do not escape soon , I may just simply disappear . Days like today , I just want to get in my car and keep driving until I run out of gas and money . 
Dear Lord , I pray that you bless me with the strength of mind to accomplish the tasks that lay before me this week . I believe that through you I can accomplish anything , and without you by my side , I will surely fail . Bless my body , mind and spirit please Lord that I may have at least one work day this week where I do NOT feel exhausted both mentally and physically at the end of the day . In Yeshua's name I pray . 
Ugh ... I got sick from the rain last night . =/ 
My sleep schedule is so outta whack . (>.<) I fell asleep when I got home from work . So , now I cannot sleep . 
Got my car back ...... got the < PROPMALE > , too . Oh well , It could be worse . 
Ugh ... I'm so tired of these headaches . (-,_) ZzzZZZzZzZzZzZZ

ugh ... acetaminophen has its limitations , and I'm testing them . =/ 
Pray for my grandmother please . Her aneurysm has blown out , and she is bleeding internally . She has to have emergency surgery tonight at Vanderbilt . It's not looking good . She has a blood disorder that makes surgery very difficult . Please pray with me tonight .

What happened to the good ole days when you filled out a paper application for employment and it only took maybe 30 minutes tops . Why does it take at least an hour to do one online these days , and why can't these people state which browsers and operating systems will not display the application correctly throughout the ENTIRE application . 
I really need to find a way to actually fall asleep . (Ó,Ò) 
WHITE CHRISTMAS YA'LL! =D 
tick tock tick tock tick tock the days 2010 are numbered ! =} 
Well , for those that don't already know . I'm joining the National Guard . I just took the ASVAB today . It was totally unexpected . I was going to do it next week but my recruiter asked me this morning if I'd like to take it today . I did , and I'm glad it's over . I did well actually . My AFQT score is an 81 ! =) 
I wish I didn't \need\ " to work today lol ... or at least if I could loose the stuffy nose . ugh . " 
You know I'd be dangerous if I learn to focus on one problem at a time . My brain just won't shut up . I keep going off on random tangents over and over again , random thoughts . It's like walking out on the branches of a tree until I fall flat on my ass and realize I'm nowhere near where I wanted to be , and now I've wasted an hour of my life . >.< I just need to tell myself to shut up ! lol 
I need a vacation ...... alone ! 
I want to be left ALONE ! 
ugh .... I can't sleep . 
* sigh * -,- # 
I'm just tired .... mentally , physically and emotionally . On the bright side ... I'm down to 183 lbs now . =/ 
My vision waiver is supposed to come back tomorrow . So , I'm going down to MEPS on Thursday to enlist as an E4 ! =) 
Apparently the military is lowering their maximum recruiting age from 42 to 35 . The new regulations begin on Friday , which means I can't get a spot to go process at MEPS tomorrow because everyone who is over 35 and is waiting on a waiver HAS to process tomorrow .... I have to wait until next week sometime . =/ 
It's going to be a fun day . I don't understand why I'm cursed with my family . 
Monday ..... yep definitely Monday . -,- * yawn *
