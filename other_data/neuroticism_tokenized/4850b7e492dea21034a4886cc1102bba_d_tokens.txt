Why do we put ourselves threw vigorous training until our feet hurt , our minds are numb , and our bodies are limp ? It's because we love the sports we play . Every minute , every second of them . It's because we are GC . It's because the cougars .... refuse .... to ..... lose .

A brother does not have to be kin . He just has to be there for you . Backin you up . Pushing you ahead . A brother knows what you mean even when you don't . A brother hears what your saying without any words being said . Brother = Better then bestfriend . Treat your fellow men as brothers and this world would change for the better . But it takes more then one person .
