bike ride at night with no light , now that was really fun !! ( no sarcasm included ) 
so i got netflix the other day and it sent me stuff so i can watch movies straight threw a wii and a ps3 ..... but i have neither , what a waist of their time lol 
A word is just a word , but the weight of its meaning is amplified drastically when it is projected onto another int he form of a promise . They think the meaning isnt there because the words \I promise\ " were not used in conjunction with the statement .... but that does not mean the pain isn't the same when the light of hope fades .... and you are left with nothing .... but darkness .... " 
Laughter is the shock absorber that eases the blows of life . 
F.M.L. !!!!!!!!! 
to all of those that i have yelled at , flipped out on for no reason , or been a complete ass to over the past week or two , im apologies . i was in a crumby mood for some reason and i realize that i was taking it out on people for no reason .... sorry ya'll . 
You can't have everything .... where would you put it ? 
dang , no six flags ....

been riding my bike nonstop for the past hour and a half now 
dang , another really super early day tomorrow .... at least im getting even more exercise , which i need more of lol . 
6 months and 9 days left ...... such a long long time ...... :( 
i think i have reached my limit on how far i can ride my bike in a day ....... so naturally i am going to force myself to ride it farther and for a longer duration of time ..... no pain no gain right ..... but not today riding bike+helping people move+working+lack of sleep = very bad combination .... nap time i think ... maybe 
good day it sounds like , so far 
today is a great day !! :D ..... but also a sad one :/ ...... 
such a long LONG day tomorrow .... it should be SO much fun .. 
finally after working pretty much all day , i am finally sitting down and it feels good 
ya know , its really hard to play a game that you have never played be for in a language that you dont know .... 
i love it when a plan comes together ! 
how come every job ive had/have the upper management praises the awesome work i do .... except menards , where the top boss says that i dont do anything and that im worthless .....? can anyone explain this to me , please ? 
crap ... i just lost my 2nd favorite hat on my way between jobs and i i dont have time to go look for it .... how sad :( 
Off tomorrow , but nothing to do ... anyone got any ideas ? 
new job , more money , < PROPMALE > to get out of the parent's place in a month or 2 ..... so why does it still feel like life sucks and is missing something :/ 
goin stir crazzy , been working by myself since 230 ... and its so slow here today :/ 
i just got attacked by zombies on VU campus ..... 2 nights in a row that have sounded like horror movies now lol 
.... how come random people walk up to me and say that i smell really good .... its really weird 
OH YEAH ! nothing like riding your bike on a beautiful day like today ! ( sarcasim included ) 
..... 
so i made more that 280 servings of stir fry tonight and i didnt even get to try it ! 
i got shot twice on my way to work this morning , spent 4 hours at the ER 
hahahaha , i made the front page .... cool 
so i have motorized transportation now , so thats a good thing 
I HAVE MINT OREOS !!! there so delicious lol 
sometimes your siting in a room with a weapon in your hand and you just want to but-stroak the person next to you in the face cause he is a freaking dumbass that doesnt know when to stop talking ... 
anyone want to tell me why i should care about this life or anything about it ... cause i really dont see a single damn reason for it , maybe i should just give up and quit i dont really care anymore 
so apparently while i was at work tonight , the 3 < PROPMALE > news stations all came to my house to interview me about me being shot by dumb-asses , and my parents did the interview instead of me , so unfair ...... i get shot and my parents get to be on tv .... not fair at all i say 
well i am gonna be on WGN news at noon today ... fun fun lol 
work from 5am till 9pm tomorrow gonna leave one job and be at the next and working 15 minutes later ...... oh so much fun tomorrow will be !!
