And if I only could , Make a deal with God , And get him to swap our places , Be running up that road , Be running up that hill , Be running up that building . If I only could , oh ... You don't want to hurt me , But see how deep the bullet lies . Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder . There is thunder in our hearts , baby . So much hate for the ones we love Tell me , we both matter , don't we ? 
All of my wrongs , and all my wicked ways Will come back to haunt me , come what may For all of the songs i hope to write someday Looks like the devil is here to stay Let me take you for a ride with the Devil in the details We'll kiss and tremble with the delight Everything is fine with the devil in the details We're gonna dance with Him tonight 
Time has stopped before us , The sky cannot ignore us , No one can separate us , For we are all that is left , The < PROPFEMALE > bounces off me , The shadow lost beside me , There's no more need to pretend , Cause now I can begin again is it bright where you are Have the people changed Does it make you happy you're so strange And in your darkest hour I hold secrets flame We can watch the world devoured in it's pain 
with < PROPFEMALE > and my aunt < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > keeps drifting in and out of awakness and im mostly hanging out with my aunt haha ! i love yall ! 
ive got a song stuck in my head and uf you knew what the song was no one would ever look at me the same way again ............ haha ;)

I am hiding from some beast , But the beast was always here , Watching without eyes\ 
Because the beast is just my fear , That I am just nothing , Now its just what I've become , What am I waiting for , Its already done \

To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away\ 
To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines\ 
We toss and turn but don't sleep\ 
Each breath we take makes us thieves\ 
Like causes without rebels\ 
Just talk but promise nothing else\ 
We crawl on our knees for you\ 
Under a sky no longer blue\ 
We sweat all day long for you\ 
But we sow seeds to see us through\ 
' Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true\ 
We wait to reap what we are due\ 
<3 
So acording to the news this morning that was a 3.6 ..... I didn't even realize it happened ! I'm just happy that we didn't have a re-run of what is happining in Haiti right now .
