is also very sad for the loss of such iconic people . 

just took the birthday quiz , a little weird because I was born in november .... but some of the description is true . weird ..... 
loves her husband , doesn't want to have a root canal tomorrow and is thinking about getting another tattoo ..... 
is pathologically terrified of sharks , but can't stop watching shark week ... I LOVE it ! there is something profoundly wrong in that .... 
watching shark week again and this shark attacked the raft the dude was standing in .... THE RAFT !!!! I would have died when she bumped the boat ... the expert said that in baja , there had been 2 other attacks on boats THAT DAY !!!! DUDE ....!!! 
is in a weird mood ...... 
jealous of those that had labor day off ...... 
says to all her high school reunion comrads : I am so happy that I got to see you guys !!! to all that I didn't have time to talk to : I miss you !! maybe we can catch up another time .... 
Even when your faith in God is the very core of your being , even when all you have is that faith , does anyone else ever feel like they're lost and floating out in the universe alone ? 
to all my fb friends : thank you so much for the birthday wishes !! and I hope that you guys have a great thanksgiving !!! 
I am having a hard time putting on my big girl panties to deal with stuff and having a harder time wanting to put my big girl panties . anybody ever been there ?
