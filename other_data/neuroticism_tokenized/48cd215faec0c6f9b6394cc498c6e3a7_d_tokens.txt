Just saw one of those little cube cars . I dislike them 
needs to go to a bookstore soon :( 
So this is how it went down ..... Apparently I was 6 and I was locked in the trunk of a car by my evil uncle from Timbuktu who has a pet hell hound ( Cerberus ) who ate my face off My mother panicked and stole a tank from the Air Force ( she was overseas fighting ninjas ) and ran over a car killing the president of the US , Canada , and Afghanistan . Somehow a swanky slinky and a set of escalators were also involved 
is up way too late . My tv issued a civil emergency warning for our county , and I didn't know what that was so I looked it up : A message issued by the National Weather Service in coordination with Federal , state or local government to warn the general public of a non-weather related time-critical emergency which threatens life or property , e.g. nuclear accident , toxic chemical spill , etc . \
