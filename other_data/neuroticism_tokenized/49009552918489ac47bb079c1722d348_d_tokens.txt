Only two tests and a trip to Mississippi seperate me from RODEO :) 
I promise you , I will always surpass your expectations . 
And they all conclude with the same sentence : \I've never met someone more self-centered Who thinks that life with a nice girl's like Waiting for a bus to work \"" 
An addiction to hands and feet-There's a meat market down the street The boys and girls watch each other eat When they really just wanna watch each other sleep 
The weight of lies will bring you down and follow you to every town , ' cause nothing happens here that doesn't happen there . 
New Orleans for shopping and lunch :) 
I keep getting excited about school being almost over , then I realized I'm going to be in Auburn for June . fml . 
You change all the lead sleeping in my head to gold As the day grows dim , I hear you sing a < PROPFEMALE > hymn It's the song I've been trying to sing ... 
But it was vile , and it was cheap And you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me 
SO EXCITED for < PROPFEMALE > Baer's wedding this summer :) looks like I'm going to be an aunt !

I tell my love to wreck it all Cut out all the ropes and let me fall My , my , my , my , my , my , my , my Right in the moment this order's tall

Zombieland on a big screen outside = best thing ever . 
forgot that < PROPMALE > Oliphant < PROPFIRST > Jukebox the Ghost all over her arm until she woke up ... 
packing is the last thing on my mind ... 
But my tongue still misbehaves and it keeps digging my own grave . 
Then you came back from space With a brand new laugh and a different face You took my hand and held it up And shot my arm full of love 
is a cold , emotionless , heartless person . Blah blah blah .

It's not a lover I want no more , and it's not heaven I'm pining for , but there's some spirit I used to know , that's been drowned out by the radio ! 
Too blind to see tomorrow , too broke to beg or borrow . Young and stupid , left wide open .

The fragile keep secrets gathered in pockets And they’ll sell them for nothing A cheap watch or locket That kind of gold washes off 
I love rollar skating , almost as much as I love my < PROPFEMALE > xi sisters ! 
I forgot how much I loved No Doubt ... 
watching < PROPMALE > with < PROPFIRST > Fowler . You're jealous 
If you wanna write a letter , write a letter If you'd rather make a phone call , pick up the phone up ... And call me But if you had to say it all with a pop song , Couldn't you at least have written me a good one ? 
head first in the shallow end , I apologize if I do not care . 
Kayaking where they filmed Big Fish ? Yes please !

about to go spend the night in the library ... 
I will be your jacket if you're stuck out in the cold . And I'll be your medication when you're sick and tired and old . And I'll be your umbrella if that roof just won't hold . I'll be your jacket if you're stuck out in the cold .

just had an epic butt war with < PROPFEMALE > Holton ... and won . Probably because she is the size of my butt . 
The world is alive now , in and outside our home You run through the < PROPMALE > , settle before the sun Darling , I can barely remember you beside me You should come back home , back on your own now 
My room eats wallets . 
In the backseats of burned out cars . In the disenchantment < PROPFIRST > . The ideal angels twist and turn , ask forgiveness for future mistakes . 
GETS TO MAKE SOUP TODAY . WHY does this make me so happy ?! 
when I grow up , I want to be < PROPFEMALE > White 
Burn it down till the embers smoke on the ground And start new when your heart is an empty room With walls of the deepest blue 
Watching me like you never watch no one Don't tell me that you didn't try and check out my bum Cause I know that you did Cause your friend told me that you liked it

All we do is win win win 
just watched the Huntsville rapist video ... for the first time . 
probably shouldn't have decided to live under overweight tapdancers who practice at night ... 
but it was not your fault but mine and it was your heart on the line 
giving blood for the first time ... 
I would be the girl whose parents ignore her calls/texts/emails/carrier pigions for weeks at a time ... 
sometimes your best defense is a good reminder of your common sense . 
I want to pull it apart and put it back together , I want to relive all my adolescent dreams Inspired by true events on movie screens I am a one man wrecking machine 
I never learn my lessons , I just change my tune 
Mama Baer is the best .
