My car died last Friday and now I'm looking for one that doesn't suck or cost more than the house I'm going to buy .... 

Man am I excited about about my trip to Chicago next week ! I intend to learn how to help lead this nations youth into a brighter future . I dunno about all of you , but I'm sick of just sitting around waiting for change . 
Just heard about Food , Inc . A movie about how horrible the big food industries are . We should all take a looksy even though our eating/buying habits will change .

I just had to tell Facebook an add for Walmart is offensive . 
I have finished writing a report on the development of Brazil's economy . What an interesting country . Full of growth , formerly protected industries , and swinging between authoritarian and republican regimes .
