< PROPFEMALE > chwistmas !! 

Just watched Saturday Night Fever last night and all I can say is . . . Why , why , why ? 
Suck an elf . 
Travel guides . . . this is why people turn to drugs 
Our stakes : If you do not use a guidebook , you will get lost and die and in the process be raped repeatedly by the creepy , fat Michelin tire guy , who is obviously strung out on crack and/or shrooms . 
Hook : The guidebook is a staple for most tourists but it will rip the very soul from your being and leave you a pathetic hollow shell wandering the streets of death ! 
Thank you so much everyone for the Birthday wishes !!! :)
