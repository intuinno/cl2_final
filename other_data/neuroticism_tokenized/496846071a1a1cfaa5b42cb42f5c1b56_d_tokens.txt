WOO ! Just got a facebook ! 

Blah ... Wildcats lost 28-38 , but had a nice time at the game anyway . 
YAY ! < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > potro won the US Open ! Federer is dethroned ! 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Swayze 
The sad thing is , even though today was a late start , I still woke up at 5:50 this morning . WHY !!!! 
YAY ! Latin Club ! 
has just died after being suffocated under a mountain of homework . 
is frolicking merrily through her home , rejoicing in the miracles of Fridays , and alarming the rest of her family . 
OMG OMG ! New < PROPFEMALE > album out !!!!! 
Yay ! Homecoming ! 
Fun time last night ! 
Monday is an awful way to spend 1/7th of your life 
Woke up thinking it was a Tuesday , then thought it was a Thursday , and just thought tomorrow was the weekend . FAIL ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > forever ! 
Just saw Whip It with friends , ate bubble gum cigarettes , and watched a marathon of my fav tv show with my sis . Good day :) 
Nothing saves you life , it only prolongs your death . Embrace the emo-ness ! 
Some cause happiness wherever they go ; others , whenever they go . - < PROPFIRST > Wilde 
Went to a < PROPFEMALE > concert last night . I sang along to all the songs , and seriously embarrassed myself and my family ! FUN ! 
Why do ducks have webbed feet ? To stomp out fires . Why do elephants have big feet ? To stomp out the burning ducks . AHAHAHAHAHAHA ! 
hates being sick ! 
You'd think I'd learn the dangers of procrastination for the millionth time , yet here I am at 11:30 at night finishing a paper I had a week to do ... 
Your life really starts to cascade into a dark realm of depression when you realize your mum threw out your Halloween < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just watched Gladiator . Feel sudden urge to fight for honor/wield a sword/seek ultimate revenge . 
I love when I get emails from some random guy saying he needs my help , and that he will send me his family fortune if I give him my social security number . I COULD GET < PROPMALE > !!!!!! 
Watching < PROPMALE > Potter again . I still believe that my Hogwarts letter just got lost in the mail . 
It's too cold out . I came home and the front door of my house was frozen shut . I've never cursed so much at an inanimate object in my life . 
Just spent 48 minutes trying to figure out the theme of revenge in Oedipus < PROPMALE > for finals . What was that sound ? Oh yeah , what little social life I had rolling over and dying . 
Watching the Simpsons 20th anniversary special on TV instead of studying for finals . Some may call it laziness . I call it celebrating family heritage . 
If I ever see another scantron again , my head will explode . 
LYSACEK WINS !!!!!!!!! < PROPFIRST > Weir was way underscored though ... 
What's the point of cramming all this information that I'm just going to forget 5 minutes after Finals are over ? IT'S A CONSPIRACY !!!!!!!! 
England versus US World Cup match . This should be intense ... 
Just dyed hair a blue/purple color . Feel oddly like a punk/smurf 
Going through my school stuff and found my freshy bio notebook . I realize that I've forgotten the whole year except the difference between mitosis and meiosis XD 9 months down the drain ... 
* sister repeatedly hits me with pillow*\ 
Mum : \Is the pillow okay ? \ " \ 
Watching < PROPFIRST > Scissorhands . Gotta love < PROPFIRST > Depp . And scissors of course :) 
Just dyed hair -- feel like I've betrayed my blonde heritage =P
