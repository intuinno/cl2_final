You're jokin , you're jokin , I can't believe my eyes . You're jokin me , you gotta be , this can't be the right guy . He's ancient , he's ugly , I don't know which is worse . I might just split a seam now if I don't die laughing first .

was on the bus after school and some guys got into a fight . The guy getting beaten up had just come out of surgery and his back was still in a lot of pain ... the other man didn't even have a good reason to beat him up .

feels like this is somehow going to affect my future ...
