vines block your vision , and u try to cut them down , eventually some regrow-eager to diminish your integrity-you must keep on trying no one said it was easy , approach it in a new way , insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a differen 

one of the prettiest things i ever did see was lightning from the top of a cloud . 
you live you learn , you laugh you learn , you cry you learn , you love you learn 
why so serious ? PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE ! BRO FOR SHO , LET UR LITE SHINE !!!! 
just weighed myself ...... the first time in a year .... and i was outraged ..... now i am laughin cuz i cant believe it . 
Met his girlfriend , she was clappin ' in the crowd Love is what was happening to him now , uh He said I would marry you but I'm engaged to these aerials and varials And I don't think this board is strong enough to < PROPFEMALE > 2 She said bow I was 120 pounds , now 
The clouds ran away , opened up the sky , and one by one i watched every constellation die , and there i was frozen , standing in my backyard , face to face , eye to eye , < PROPFEMALE > ring at the last < PROPFEMALE > , i shouldve known , walked all the way home . 
feels great !.. everything is gonna be fine fine fine cuz i got one hand in my pocket and the other one is giving a high five ... ppl can hurt me , but ill take that hurt and make it into something good , iknow wats its like to feel lost and notwanted , so my go 
she is an angel with a broken wing . 
i have one wing , but when im with him , i feel as though i have two , i look into his eyes and they take me to a different place . 
we need shades cuz our future is so bright !.... 
there are three types of love , i have picture love , one that captures the sweetness as it is for what it is , as it really is , and that will never fade or damage and long as i take care of that picture . my love is true and it means something beyond comprehension . stay sweet , be young at heart . 
I will not waste chalk , for it paints the pavement with fairytale dreams and wishes that the heart makes . some walk on the pavement without a second thought , but we should be grateful that it gives us balance , and provides another blank < PROPFEMALE > that calls for us to paint . 
im with carlina and < PROPFEMALE > when they say .... it's a HAIRFLIP ! FO SHO .... lol 
you gotta be honest , its all based on truth and trust , brake what you got and it wont ever be the way it was . you cant win if you arent rite within . and dont lie to yourself , dont mesh into the crowd . thats all i have to say ........ oh and random i just painted with my sis and cuz ......... partay ......... haha 
just helped put a second coat of paint on the ceiling , then going shopping , then out to eat with my girls .... hey partay ! 
the computer got overheated and turned off ... ugh ! 
had ALOT OF FOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i finally checked my classes .... and they are messed up ! got to change that pronto ! 
give it a rest , this is not some contest , just do your best , cuz nobody is perfect . 
lets play some singstar ! 
skyscraper , you defy the skyline , opposite the grape vine-where crows and rumors fly . Sky scraper take me to the show , give me every sunrise , some connection , protection from a bitter soul . If you ever need my hand to < PROPFEMALE > through the heavy times , ill be there . 
went to the beach and and scratched the scalp of the earth , the grains of sand that kissed my finger tips , reminded me that i am only a minute piece to the puzzle of the earth , but then brought to my realization that one grain of sand would mean nothing if there werent other grains gracing its presense as well . Alone we are merely nothing , together we complete something . I love you guys ! 
a castle made of sand falls into the sea , eventually . 
cupid choke hold . 
Not a facade cherisher , I’d rather have the scars I don’t idolize < PROPFEMALE > , I’m dancing with the stars Uh huh . All of them ? Yeah , they are , too . You look up and you see us Shining Down on you . Thought I was down . Thought I was gone . Thought I was around . I left you alone . Look Up in the Sky . Just look Up in the Sky . See that I’m everywhere 
castles made of sand , slip into the sea eventually . 
She was lost in so many different ways Out in the darkness with no guide I know the cost of a losing hand Never thought the grace of god go highI found heaven on earth You were my last , my first And then here this voice inside Ave mariaSometimes love can come and pass you by While your busy making plans Suddenly hit you and then you realize It's out of your hands , baby you got to understand 
It's a beautiful day Sky falls , you feel like It's a beautiful day Don't let it get away 
when i looked out my window , it was blurred , the cracks distorted the outer image , but even though it was damaged , i could still see the light shine through . 
She was lost in so many different ways Out in the darkness with no guide I know the cost of a losing hand Never thought the grace of god go high 
When I thought I found a good one I found better when I thought I had better I found the BEST . 
I can make it through the rain I can stand up once again On my own and I know That Im strong enough to mend And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith And I live one more day And I make it through the rain 
Have you ever loved someone so much , you'd give an arm for ? Not the expression , no , literally give an arm for ? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armour And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm ' her But what happens when < PROPFEMALE > , turns right around and bites you ? And everything you stand for , turns on you , despite you ? What happens when you become the main source of her pain ? 
if tht boy dont love you by now , he will never love you 
ugh ......... STUPID COMPUTERS HATE YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHH FEEL LIKE SWEARING , JUST GONNA DROP THEM ALL OUT THE WINDOW ! 
GOTTA WRITE THIS ESSAY TODAY :( 
DONE WITH ESSAY , DONT WORRY I WILL GET ENOUGH SLEEP I ALREADY HAD LIKE AN HOUR NAP . 
STARS MAKE MY DAY 
dnt make life harder than wht it is ...... like me . 
can you site documents within a sentence ? Like ( Doc . 2 ) this .? 
Everyone has the ability to reach the top , its character that keeps you there . 
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears exciting and inviting me Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns It calls me on and on across the universe Jai guru deva om Nothing's gonna change my world 
make a shadow , dont be one , in other words , be your own leader 
he sees me for who i am instead of what i am , now that is what i call a man 
Let's see how many people on fb aren't ashamed to show their love for God and admit that Jesus is their savior . We need to get God back in < PROPFEMALE > . If you're not ashamed , copy and paste this in your status ! :) I'm not ! 
I HAD THE BEST BIRTHDAY EVER ! IM SO HAPPY AND SO BLESSED ! 
Skyscraper You define the skyline Opposite the grapevine Where crows and rumors fly 
just smile at the sky and i guarentee that it will smile back :) 
cause a face without freckles is like a sky without stars Why waste a second not loving who you are Those little imperfections make you beautiful , lovable , valuable , They show your personality inside your heart Reflecting who you are 
i just dont know them anymore

Your assumptions are your windows on the world . Scrub them off every once in a while , or the light won’t come in . 
Our dreams , and they r made out of real thingsLike a , shoebox of photographsWith sepiatone loving . Love is the answer , At least for most of the questions in my heartLike y r we here ? And where do we go ? And how come it's so hard ? It's not always easy andSometimes life can be deceivingI'll tell you 1 thing it's always better when we r together 
wintersong-Sara Bareilles/Ingrid Michaelson 
all of the colors seemed to fade , see me crumble and fall on my face , and i know theres mistakes that i have made .... wish they'd all disappear without a trace 
What's wrong with smiling ? What's wrong with peace ? What's wrong is squashing people before they label you deceased ? Swallow your pride before you choke on your issues I know you got family and folks that'll miss you So don't misuse this gift you've been given This life's but a dream , you're blessed to be livin 
why ? 
Jesus ... I NEED YOU , help me . 
IM AM HAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Jesus .... i need you , help me . 
i dont like it when things get messy ...... it is the product of procrastinated change and confusion . ugh i am so sick of it . why am i such a mess 
I crossed the street today , and I dont even remember if I looked for cars . 
she concentrates so so hard on the music and so she loses herself in the bass and the movement ... lay down in that music box , escape in the sound of that music box . 
CHICAGO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PARTY ! SO EXCITED ! 
JUST LET ME GO ! 
All the movements you're starting to make See me crumble and fall on my face And I know the mistakes that I made See it all disappear without a trace And they call as they beckon you on They said start as you mean to go on Start as you mean to go on 
maybe it would be for the best 
Mr. Dropp you were a wonderful person , I didn't have you for a teacher for more than a day , but you always showed and practiced your compassion for people , you were a good man , thank you , may you rest in peace . God Bless .

My mind is muddy but my heart is heavy . Does it show ? I lose the track that loses me , so here I go . I'm not calling for a second < PROPMALE > , I'm screaming at the top of my voice . Give me reason but don't give me choice . ' Cause I'll just make the same mistake again . 
my little sister is a zombie trapped in a body with solo role she has learned to play in the world today where nothing else matters ..... BUT IT MATTERS ... we gotta start feeding our souls not our addictions or afflictions of pain to avoid the same questions we must ask oursleves to get any anwswers when all want is love , she needs to love herself .

another nite with unspoken words where things longed to be said but couldnt find the right moment , maybe they never will find the right moment , something will always interfere , or you will allow them too out of fear .

listening to song called blind by lifehouse 
the prettiest thing i ever did see , was lightning from the top of a cloud , moving through the dark a million < PROPMALE > an hour with some where to be ..... so why does it seem like a picture that's hangin up on someone else's wall , lately i havnt been myself at all ... its heavy on my mind ... 
seniors last full day tomar .. enjoy it :) 
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Please dont treat me like im stupid , okay . I know the ropes , ive climbed that obstacle , and i have the guts to do what it takes reguardless of the nonesense you < PROPFEMALE > to babble . 
nobody knows .... 
no song seems to fit how i feel maybe thats the problem . ive been searching and searching and all i find is the same old same old . 
whatev 
i cannot find the heart i gave away 
It's hard to live , there are oceans to swim , mountains to hike , streets to cross , it's hard finding a sense of direction , but have that faith that integrity that will power , and nothing can stop you . If one is born into battle , its all they know and they learn how to adopt and eventually win when the tocks of time stop tickin . 
I took my bruises , took my lumps\ 
Fell down and I got right back up\ 
But I need that spark to get psyched back up\ 
And in order for me to pick the mic back up 
let's trade shoes\ 
Just to see what it'd be like to\ 
Feel your pain , you feel mine\ 
Go inside each other's mind\ 
Just to see what we find 
Actions speak louder than words . 
HAPPY EARLY FATHER'S DAY MOM ! i love ya , thanks for always being there and for being both a mom and a dad to all of us . 
Tennessee is AWESOME !!!!!!!!!! 
When I was younger , I saw my daddy cry , And curse at the wind , He broke his own heart , And my momma swore that , She would never let herself forget , And that was the day that I promised , I'd never sing of love , But YOU are the only exception 
dont let them say you aint beautiful ...... just stay true to you .... you know the shoes you walk in best 
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope , without a circus net , I'm a nervous wreck , I deserve respect ; but I work a sweat for this worthless check 
If I could just get over this humpBut I need something to pull me out this dump I took mybruises , took my lumpsFell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back upIn order for me to pick the mic back upI don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm inI'm starting to feel distant againSo I decided just to pick this penUp and try to make an attempt to vent 
We got this . 
Im blessed truely blessed ... thank you Jesus , be with us on this adventure 
It aint worth having if it's to much to hold , it can dig so deep that all you're left with is a hole , I don't want to end up that pirate bones , < PROPFIRST > in a desert with a bag of gold , what I thought was best was just a pile of stones , i might have the treasure but I'll be lying alone ... if i have to forfeit my soul it aint worth having !

Follow your heart and see where it might take you\ 
Don't let the world outside there break you\ 
They know not who you are inside\ 
They have never felt your hell\ 
Don't ever let them crack ... \ 
Your shell ... 
i love dancing in the rain !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Im lookin fear in the face and tellin it i dont care . If my feet bleed Im still marchin foward , whenever the winds slap my cheek it will only feel like a kiss , sometimes livin thru the hell distinguishes what the heaven really is , dont look at the bad , let the light shine thru . yeah , u may not hav shoes , but at least u still hav feet to footprint ur signature in the sand.it doesnt matter wat u get its all about what u got . 
Wohoo ! ready to dance in this lovely blue dress ! 
I know the darkness falls on you . And it’s just a point of view \ 
When you’re outside looking in you belong to someone and when \ 
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end , like your \ 
heart can break in two , someone loves you . 
Well , I am saving up to go to NY to audition for Julliard acting school . Something is telling me I have try , do not want to have any regrets . 
< PROPFIRST > VISITED ME AT SCHOOL TODAY , IT WAS AWESOME ! I LOVE SURPRISES :D 
I am there through the snow , I am there through the sun , through the rain , the clouds , all the same , dont forget that 
God gave you the shoes that fit you , put them on , wear them , be yourself , be true to you . 
im a messy painter , but i have my vision , all around it may be chaos , but that chaos it beautiful if you allow it to brush agiant your < PROPFEMALE > , experience can make you wise if you listen to the hues that surround you 
These days we go to waste like wine\ 
That's turned to turpentine\ 
Till it's 6 AM and I'm all messed up\ 
I didn't mean to waste your time\ 
So I'll fall back in line\ 
But I'm warning you we're growing up 
smiling GOT TO SEE < PROPFEMALE > , SEE < PROPFEMALE > :D GOING TO CONCERT !!!!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS ..... :D SO HAPPY .... STARBUCKS ........ MUHAHAHA ;) 
IM NOT THE KIND OF GIRL WHO CANT SEE REASON !!!!!!! 
I LOVE YOU MOM ! 
LET IT BEND BEFORE IT BREAKS , I CAN MAKE MY OWN MISTAKES . 
Around here it’s Around here it’s the hardest time of year\ 
Waking up , the days are even gone \ 
Though the color of my coat\ 
Lord help me killing off the cold\ 
Where the raindrops sting my eyes \ 
I keep them closed the hardest time of year\ 
I keep them closed 
Around here it’s the hardest time of year\ 
Say it’s over , say I’m dreamin \ 
Say I’m better than you left me \ 
Say you’re sorry , I can take it\ 
Say you’ll wait , say you won’t \ 
Say you love me , say you don’t \ 
I can make my own mistakes\ 
Let it bend before it breaks 
if it's too much to hold , it's not worth having . if i have to forefeit my soul it aint worth having . 
Im not perfect and i can live with that . 
Every time you close a door and nothing opens in its place you've wasted\ 
And when you speak the words you know to those who know the words themselves you're wasted , \ 
You're such a classic waste of cool , so afraid to break the rules in all the wrong places 
I'm like the rain in a downpour\ 
I wash away what you long for\ 
And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes\ 
I wish I could be there tonight\ 
I'm like the wind in the canyon\ 
I'm there when I'm gone in a second 
never blame the rainbows for the rain 
cant wait till tomarrow ! 
i want to fly free but , what does that really mean ? 
truth is what i need . 
sick of the mask , the world is beautiful , it is < PROPFEMALE > we try to cover it up -it becomes ugly 
Not everything that shines is going to be gold 
hmm should i start the second college essay .... hmmmmmm 
The soundtrack still runs through my head\ 
I gotta keep every single step\ 
As old as we get , we don't forget\ 
We won't forget 
no facebook for me tonight !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
you cannot read my sentence because it does not contain words , only works of spirals and mazes , paint splashes and perks , nothing of solid strict embroidery , just as flexible as the tissue of a cloud . 
The integrity of a river is often defined by the obstructions it surmounts on its journey , and how those obstacles impel it to leave a legacy upon every grain of soil that it will ever touch . 
didnt mean to hurt you , ill try harder , ill believe more . 
I walked across an empty land\ 
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand\ 
I felt the earth beneath my feet\ 
Sat by the river and it made me complete I came across a fallen tree\ 
I felt the branches of it looking at me\ 
Is this the place we used to love ? \ 
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of ? 
nothing's gonna change my world 
WOW , I WAS GOING TO PUT UP A REALLY DEPRESSING STATUS , BUT THEN I WAS REMINDED OF SOMETHING ....., THE DAY HAS GOTTEN BETTER :) 
It sucks that you think where I'm from is wack\ 
\I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden \""

yo man , i only pursue drama on the stage , so if you find it entertaining to participate in its humors in every day life , thats your role , but not mine , you can say all you want about me , your words cannot define me , I know who I am . 
I don't want artificial lighting , after i felt the sun , nothing can compare . its time to break that lamp and lay in the rays , love is real .
