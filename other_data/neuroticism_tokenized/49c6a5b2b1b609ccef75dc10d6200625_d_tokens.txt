To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! Re-post if you agree . 
I had a good time with < PROPMALE > and grandpa . We went to breakfast with a bunch of people . Two of them are from Wisconsin , which I found cool .

So , let me get this straight ... < PROPFEMALE > Grammar can end a 15-year marriage by phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , 53% of Americans get divorced and 30-60% cheat on their spouses .
