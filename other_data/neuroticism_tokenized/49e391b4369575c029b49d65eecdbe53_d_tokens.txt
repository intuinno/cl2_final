A true friend doesn't care if you're broke , your house is a mess , or your familly is filled with crazies ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least one true friend ! 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted .

ASKING IF EVERYONE COULD PLEASE PUT THIS AS YOUR STATUS FOR ONE HOUR IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS OR HAD CANCER . MY PRAYER IS THAT IN 2011 A CURE WILL BE FOUND . WILL YOU POST IT ? JUST DO IT FOR ONE HOUR . DO IT FOR ALL OF US IN MEMORY OF TOO MANY TO MENTION AND IN HONOR OF ALL FIGHTING IT !! 
You are sitting at a bar . A song comes on and suddenly you think of me . What song is playing ? Pass this on and see what songs you get . 
For < PROPFIRST>'s Day-change your profile picture to a picture of you and your significant other and tell how long you have been together . 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy ... but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are ! 
Many times I've tried to tell you ; \ 
Many times I've cried alone\ 
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone\ 
\ 
Don't want to leave you really ; I've invested too much time\ 
To give you up that easy to the doubts that complicate your mind\ 
We belong to the light ; We belong to the thunder . \ 
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under 
me < PROPFEMALE > llorando el corazon\

el llanto corre por mis venas\ 
amigo mio que dolor\

... I see your broken love\ 
And I know my life , I know I’m right\ 
We’re gonna shake this thing tonight\ 
Because I’ll bleed you love , and I’ll give you life\ 
I’ve seen your heart in a tainted light\ 
We’re gonna make this love tonight 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour .
