I hate it when some people are overly ungrateful of the things others give them . 

I will never look at some 13 year old's news feed again . My eyes are bleeding from the way they type things . Bells will NEVER have a facebook . 
Yaaaay ! The friends keep piling up XD 
is screaming like an angry ferret 
Im so angry I could just eat this god-forsaken hunk of plastic and metal !!! \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Gotta get up early . >.< 
You think patting me on the head is gonna fix that bullshit ?! ( hiss ) 
We can put our differences aside . For science . You monster . 
Who will make the cake when I'm gone ? 
No longer angry , just a little creeped out >.> 
Being lazy right now , though eventually have to get up to get my ID for the third time ... Its like its my < PROPFEMALE > not to get alcohol lol 
In 7-10 days , it will once again be in my < PROPFEMALE > to buy my own booze ! < PROPMALE > sob stories ! \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Mead and my new outfit have arrived . < PROPFEMALE > gets her present , and I get to jingle ! \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
I'm at work . This blows more than hookers do . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Its been a long time , but I feel as if we never stopped . It makes me smile inside ! \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
( scatters hearts everywhere while throwing up ) 
Fuck Fuck fuck . Motha motha fuck , motha motha fuck fuck , mothafuck mothafuck , noise noise noise . 
A massive flurry of multiple shots going off in the woods across the lake . Zombies ? \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Cheesecake is the bastard child of cake and pie . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Ahahaha , I got my ID ... again . I need to staple it to me , or something . 
I dont like what Im eating , but its filling and competely vegan ... I dont see how people do it . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
To < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Shear , and other vegans , I don't know how you do it . Last night and this morning , I tried , and successfully choked down vegan foods . Now , if I see a cow , I'm going to chew on it . Good on you guys . 
I really hope that when Bells gets older , she asks for kid wood or whatever it's called . I'll hand her some Styrofoam and tell her to build me the Argo . 
You . With the face . Gimme one . Now . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
NO MA'AM!!!! 
Still awake .... I really can't sleep just yet . But its cold . * whines * 
I gotta start getting ready . Work is my enemy ... 
Right , so I was just texting to my little brother and he asks about you again . I told him if he didn't shut up , not only was I going to knock him out , but I'd put my cock in his mouth and take a picture . 
Holy raging ragamuffin shit . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Black currant vanilla or Mango butter with vanilla seeds ? Tough choice ... \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Diablo 2 installed . Thumb woke me up this morning . Its throbbing like a priest for a choir boy . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Im a monster that loves to tickle buildings\\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Whoever is going to the wave should bring me a lime ... please ? \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Look at your status , now back to mine . Now back your status , now back at mine . Sure it's not the same , but while you were reading this , I robbed you blind of those diamonds <3 
Its hard to overstate my satisfaction . 
Its time my little self got off this computer , and hope no bad stuff happens . that would blow ... kinda like < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > does . Ahahahaha 
I need to clone myself . seriously . That would be epic . I could send myself to work , while I lazed about and slept lol 
\Beware the fury of a patient man\ " ... what kinda fortune cookie fortune says that ? \\n-Clockwork Cutie " 
Has her own WoW account ! YESSSSSS ! 
Stove top and a granola bar . 
I hurt my stitches ... while digitally bowling . 
My little brother just seriously asked me who < PROPFIRST > Connery is ... 
I made a promise . Totally the second best promise Ive ever made . <3 \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
I try to calm a friend down , and I get someone jumping down my throat for supposedly saying something that was mentioned , but agreed wouldn't happen . Not talking to people seems like a really good policy right now . /facepalm 
Well done , Android . The enrichment center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance . 
Sigh . I have a bad feeling about today . 
I am the girl who surrounds herself with a tough , harsh shelll , a fortress for the frail spirit , the same girl that will go to the ends of the earth and back , if only to see you smile , even for a little while . I hide what I've done and what others have done to me with a child-like heart and a smile . 
I hate people that ruin decent pictures with ill-disguised shitty comments ... \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
When I was little , I never wanted to be like < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFIRST > . I wanted to be like Meg . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
My hair looks black and a little fluffy today . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is displeased . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
/sigh\ 
FB , you need a \Dislike\ " button . Seriously . " 
I stopped playing the following games :\ 
Restaurant City , Fishville , and Cafe world . 
I'm gonna get the old-school animated < PROPFEMALE>'s Web . Screw that remake . 
\Hey baby ... are those pants purple ? ' Cause your ass is epic . \"" 
Fear me for I am a death koi ! Muahahahaha\ 
>.> 
I'm feeling better . Of course its AFTER all the funness of Neko and the week that I can't see < PROPMALE > at all >.< \ 
But I gots Bells :D 
Dear facebook , < PROPMALE > wants me to die of embarassment . That is all . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Dear FB , I have proof that < PROPFIRST > is a furry lover . That is all . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
What could be easier than feathers and dynamite ? 
Is heavily considering making falls . 
So help me god if that tantrum-throwing cockbite wakes up Bells , Im going to mop the floor with him . 
I love it how when I was little , my < PROPFEMALE > always told me to be honest . Now I tell the truth and she glares at me . 
T-13 is a woman . \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
< PROPMALE > as my witness , I went in my brothers room and found used lipstick . Im not trollin'\\n-Clockwork Cutie 
* Hits the navy with a big frozen fish * Give him back already , damn you ! \\n-Clockwork Cutie 
Yes T13 , my cheetos are delcious blasphempy . 
Goddamnit . Why the fuck is this d-bag here when I have no way of leaving ? Was I one of the people who stabbed that jesus guy or something ?! That's not even geting into the fact that Bells is here , or that we have to be up and ready by 7 . 
Thanks to a certain someone ... the driving part of this trip has royally sucked . I'll die before I get in a car with this many family members again . 
WE'RE FINALLY IN < PROPFEMALE > . Im that much closer to your arms .... * pukes * 
Matching dragons ! Muahahaha ! 
Dear lungs . Its been almost a month since I quit smoking . So why the hell are you in worse shape ? 
You only wanted someone to understand you , be careful what you wish for because I do . 
So much shame ... 
Can someone help me please ? Im having a bad asthma attack and I have no inhaler . \\n-RAWLRLRLRLR ! 
The shower thing really helped . Thanks so much . \\n-RAWLRLRLRLR ! 
Nerdy wallet is nerdy :3 \\n-RAWLRLRLRLR ! 
< PROPFEMALE > C . Mais and < PROPFIRST > Mais : Can you look around your house for my phone ? I can't find that god-forsaken hunk of tumors , metal , broken dreams and plastic to save my small ass . 
New phone ! Its pretty effin sweet !! 
I'm up and awake . Let firey rain commence . 
Waiting on plane to go to Florida . So excited ! 
My new number is 757 803 4310 . Please text me your name , so I'm not overly confused :3 
Currently watching the news . Happy New Years !!!!! 
Murrrrrrr = 3 = 
For all those who didn't answer their phones . < PROPMALE > propsed to me Saturday night , and I couldn't be happier ! 
Going to the airport for the first plane . Whooooo ! 
This dickhole just assumed I named my child after a porn star ... really ? Seriously ?! 
Watching Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with < PROPMALE > 
I want a dragon roll please ! 
I feel like something is gnawing away at me . But I can't place it . 
Gotta go out to the car . > < 
You know what ? I want a cookie . You bring me cookie I love you long time . 
* flops down on floor * Ungh .... this blows , and that's that . 
I'm awake world . May your lives be filled with joy ( except for < PROPFIRST > and Steve ... heh ) :D 
I'm feeling a bit ... nice . As in I should be nice to someone . I think I'm getting sick . 
The nicety has passed . I think I'm good now . 
Going home to < PROPMALE > after a totally awesome party at < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s new place ! <3 ! 
I'm awake now ... all my beef jerky is gone . My tummy hurts a bit , but I have < PROPMALE > , and soon I'll have Bells too ! 
Me and Bells woke up at 11 . She didn't sleep very good at all . Like night terrors . 
I never get lost . I just go on random exploration trips . 
Dear HRBT , go suck a big bag of dicks and Fucking collapse on all the goddamned retarded drivers . 
I feel ... out of sorts today . Not nice , but calm . I'm strangely comfortable with it . 
I PASSED ! I DID IT ! 
Just got pictures with Bells . And I didn't take my lip ring out and < PROPFEMALE > got maaaad lol 
12 places in Newport News . 42 in Norfolk . 10 in Hampton . All these choices are making me dizzy > > 
Miraculously , I've gotten it down to the place I want . Picking from all its venues is another matter . 
< PROPFEMALE > Masquerade for me tonight . Stuck up in Yorktown until tomorrow :/\ 
Sorry guys ! 
Hello world . I'm awake-ish ... that means its bedtime x3 
After < PROPMALE > gets this stuff done , we'll be heading hoooome :3 
Are there any other people with Verizon phones that suddenly say \Searching for service for NO apparent reason ? " 
Enjoys scaring skater kids :D 
Sometimes , biting your tongue is the hardest thing you'll ever do . 
* screams like an angry ferret * I just wanna rip someone's spinal cord out and beat them with it ! >:O 
Contacted the gardens , and its looking amazing so far ! Reworked the plan and its looking way more affordable ! 
Researched the gardens further and found a pretty sweet deal . Little privy , but really doable . Looked into their catering lists , picked two reasonable ones . 
What the hell could lead to a law like this ? Excuse my language , but whoever supports this is a worthless cockbite and I hope you get set on fire . 
Venue down . Bunch of stuff to go lol 
Had a wonderful time with < PROPFEMALE > , scraping snow off the cars in < PROPFEMALE>'s driveway and having a mini snowball fight ! 
I wonder if my ex's think I have the memory of a dog or something . 
Today is Valentines day . I just realized this fact :/ 
Stupid printer . I'd kick it in the face if it had one . 
Sleep ? Why yes , I think I'll have some of that . 
I haven't managed to crawl out of bed . I don't wanna go to work D: 
Off to the place of workingness . Maybe I should get candies ... 
Someone just said I was a nice person :D 
I think that if I ever have a butler , he'd have to be < PROPFIRST > Caine , and I'd have to be able to call him < PROPMALE > . 
Bbbbbbvvvvkv 
And now it is time for this little kajira to dream . 
Sometimes I wish I wouldn't dream . :/ 
I'm unsure of how I feel today 
Playing an awesome game that I'm already addicted to :3 
I made it to work relatively on time :3 Thanks < PROPMALE > ! 
New clothes in new colors . Awesome skirt needs a little taking in , but otherwise beautiful . 
Right . Went to look at cakes and try to find a zipper since we were already in walmart ... there were all of 3 of those , and the woman that I asked about a zipper 
Today is going to be a little busy , but totally worth it :3 
Best . Voicemail . Ever . 
Just do we're all clear , I blame you . :D 
Whooooo , work . 
I love it when people delete me because they dislike/can't handle what I have to say . I'm not trolling . 
Never gonna give you up , never gonna let you down , never gonna run and desert you . Never gonna make you cry , never gonna say goodbye , never gonna tell a lie and 
\but then you all of a sudden have a to avoid hitting him in order to avoid a fiery death\ " \ 
I am such a damn scatterbrain sometimes . >.< 
The meaning of Easter is really Cadbury cream eggs . 
Bells + pizza rolls = total bliss 
Formulating a costume >:3 
* waits to hear news of a hurricane on her wedding * 
I punched < PROPFIRST > in the face because he almost messed with my coloring book . 
Laundry ... * dislike * 
T-13 : \I do not wear ribbons in my hair . \ " \ 
Sleep , why have you abandoned me ? 
Bells was apparently so happy I put on pants , she hugged my legs and said \Thank you . \"...." 
I drove today ! 
Sometimes I get a insatiable urge to blow the world up . 
Finally , after five hours , its done ! 
I felt a little lonely .... so I hugged the xbox :3
