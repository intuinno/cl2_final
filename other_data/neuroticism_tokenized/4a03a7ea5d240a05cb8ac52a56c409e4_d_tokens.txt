how do you get a map in storage to work 
Lucky me ! Had a wonderful day with < PROPFIRST > ( <3 ) . Like normal , he has to leave and I hate it . But I will see him soon again :D . Also , dreading school . Still don't have my drivers like I was begging for all summer . Found some things to customize my car , but need money to do so . :( 
Don't want to go to school . I want to sleep ' til late and refresh my mind . One year left yay ! Also , one year AGAIN without my drivers ( still majorly pissed ) . Riding the bus during your senior year sucks . Life must go on , so be it . Dreams just seem to be fading in the vast distance anyway . I still have my < PROPFIRST > :) See you guys tomorrow . Buh-Bye . 
First day of being a senior . . . How do I put this ? Seems like my classes are going to be easy . Only concerned about trig and econ . But the teachers will most likely make it easy . Don't get to see < PROPFIRST > much in the hall :'( Honestly , I have most classes without my friends in them . But so far , so good . Hopefully next semester will be better . It normally is . I love my < PROPFIRST > <3 
Almost a week of school . WOW ! I have survived . But how you ask ? I'm got superpowers ! WHOO ! SOon to be out and free like a bird ! Still want my drivers though :( I don't know why Mom won't let me get them . I <3 Travis 
I feel sick and just want to go to sleep . I love < PROPFIRST > 
with my baby and having fun off to moms work for Halloween party 
I love < PROPFIRST > !! :) He is the best thing that ever happened to me . I just want to spend the rest of my life with him . He's a dream come true ! 
Thinking I didn't do good on the ACT . I love < PROPFIRST > . 
Had an amazing Christmas with < PROPFIRST > and his family . :) I love my < PROPFIRST > <3 
Im with < PROPFIRST > and so happy :) 
I love < PROPFIRST >
