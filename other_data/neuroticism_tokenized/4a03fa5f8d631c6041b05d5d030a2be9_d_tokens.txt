Jumping on the ( dirty ) trampoline with < PROPMALE > , Kaytlin , and < PROPFIRST > under roiling clouds , feeling the wild wind , hearing the grumbling thunder as the storm prepared to let loose ... what a blast that was ! We had such fun together , and saw our neighbor standing on his fence next door taking pics of the sky .

Anyone ? What FOODS are best to soothe a sore scratchy throat ? ( Other than the obvious - soft warm food like mashed potatoes ) I'm HUNGRY . I'm tired of hot tea , which only helps while it's going down . S.T. probably caused by post-nasal drip . 
logging out so the kids can use the laptop for their history assignments , and so I can eat lunch and get bloated on salty soft foods to soothe my sore throat ... guess I'll have a puffy face for a few days more ;) 
I'm such a wimp !!! Sore throats really get me down . The only relief I had from it today was one of my newer piano students - he was a great distraction , but now it's hitting me again . I can't stay focused ... brain won't work . sigh 
ok ... back to Bible Bowl .. 
Mmm mmm good homemade potato soup ! 
is a Christian and proud to say it !! Let's see how many people on fb aren't afraid to show their love for God ! Repost this as your status .

Oh , and his voice teacher says he'll be a tenor instead of bass - probably one of the good ones ! yay ! 
O God , you are my God , earnestly I seek you ; my soul thirsts for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water . Because your love is better than life , my lips will glorify you ... with singing lips my mouth will praise you . Because you are my help , I sing in the shadow of your wings .
