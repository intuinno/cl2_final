JUST A THOUGHT : politician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6-15 months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension is not reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expense account ; a soldier must justify extra rations . A politician vows to defend their country ; a soldier actually keeps that promise . RE-POST IF YOU SUPPORT OUR TROOPS !!!

PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable & in case you didn’t know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won’t copy and paste ... this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower , armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome & will re-post this .....

only I could go out to the car to get something and mess up both my knees and left ankle/foot . I hate being a clutz ! 
hey people , it was an earthquake . while tragic it was on THE RING OF FIRE ! a geologically active area . that doesn't mean its a prophecy from the bible or that atheists are being punished ( because most japanese are not atheists ) it means that an earthquake happened where they happen alot . it's the same as going to a horror movie . you know they're gonna try to scare ya , but you don't know when or how . same concept !
