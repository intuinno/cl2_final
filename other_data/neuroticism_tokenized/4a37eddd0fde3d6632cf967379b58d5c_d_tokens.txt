So , you know when you have one of those crazy moments on video , but can't show anyone because your mom does want people to think your little brother might be gay ? Yeah , I have one of those . D: 
But you couldn't last a lifetime . Caught between here and the days of it ; carving their name across your arm with every wish . It's hit or miss ... 
Not feeling good again ... ugh . I hate feeling this way . 
Ice cream and a movie . Its a good night . 
Its not like I totally hate my job , its the fact that I'm stuck with children all under the age of 12 , and there is absolutely nobody around in this neighborhood to talk to . D: It suckssss . 
Sitting on the porch watching little kids attempt to play whiffle ball . Its an interesting thing . xD 
HOME TOMORROW ! <3 
I need people's opinions on what the best pie is , so I can bake it . Leave them ! ;D 
Possibly making the pies tomorrow . ;D 
Pie making day ! :D 
Summer mornings are awful . Wayyy to hot . 
Before you do anything , think . If you do something to try and impress someone , to be loved , accepted or even to get someone's attention , stop and think . So many people are busy trying to create an image , they die in the process . -Salma Hayek

“Don’t count your chickens before they hatch . One of the eggs might turn out to be a dinosaur . ” :) 
Homemade chocolate chip cookies . <3 
Finally found my cat that has been missing for two weeks . <3 Got bit in the process of getting him home though . :P 
“If there ever comes a day when we can't be together , keep me in your heart , I'll stay there forever” <3 
Alright , my computer says it isn't recognizing a battery , yet I'm running without the charger plugged in . This doesn't make any sense . 
Good news and bad news . Bad news : My macbook pro needs a new mother board because the system won't recognize my battery even when they put a new one in . Good news : I'm not paying a dime because its under warranty . :D 
It's \ 
always useful to know where a friend-and-relation is , \ 
whether \ 
you want him or whether you don't .

I think life just really hates me this week . :/ 
“I wanted a perfect ending . Now I’ve learned , the hard way , that some poems don’t rhyme , and some stories don’t have a clear beginning , middle , and end . Life is about not knowing , having to change , taking the moment and making the best of it , without knowing what’s going to happen next . ” ~ Gilda Radner 
Getting ready then going out ?
