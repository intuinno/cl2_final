When you go to a haunted house , do they usually offer you a job ? 
if you spend your whole life waiting for the storm , you never get to enjoy the sunshine . 
its hard to wake from a nightmare , when the nightmaree is true . 
If I've said anything to you that I should be sorry for , I'm glad . 
nothing good happens after 2 a . m .. 
65 days til schools out . 
i need a job , but i'm not even 15 yet . Any ideas ? 
you cant always get , what you want . 
if love be rough with you , be rough with love . 
some choices are easy , some stay with you for ever . 
when somebody's worth it , you just have to put yourself out there . 
this week could not go by any slowerr . 
I would slap you senseless , but I don't have three seconds to spare . 
I'd rather pass a kidney stone than spend any more time with you . 
i want to go surfing .
