You never know how much you truly loved someone or needed them in your life until they are gone , and then there is nothing you can do about it .. 
i wonder why we have noses that run and feet that smell ... 
I love my crazy , lovanle , sometimes stupid boyfriend ! Thats why were perfect for each other !!! :D I love you babe ! <3 
Never love if your not prepared to be hurt , never start if you don't intend to finish , never speak if you don't mean it , & never say I love you if you don't feel it . 
I think i'm getting the flu or something .. i feel like im gonna barf ): 
no matter what you do , no matter what you say , no matter how u act ... i will always love you ... you might not know it , but i do . 
I try so hard to smile a little , to laugh once in a while ... but no matter what i do , the pain just wont go away .. 
Once you've been hurt , it is so hard to get attached again . The fear that it will happen again is what builds the walls around your heart . 
Wakes up thinking about you , goes to sleep thinking about you , and thinks about you every moment in between . I love you < PROPFIRST > . 
The worst part isn't knowing you were lied to , but knowing that you weren't worth the truth . 
< PROPFIRST > is the most amazing person ever !!! I love him so much , he is the one typing this but it still makes him feel special 
Wonders why men ask you whats wrong when they really don't want to hear the answer . And they already know it's something they did . 
no guy is ever worth your tears . but once you find the one that is , they wont make you cry . 
So I leave for vacation in 6 days , so excited !!!! 
Havin a blast in South < PROPFEMALE > !!

April 20 , 1999 . 15 people were killed including 12 students , one teacher , and the suicides of the two gunmen . The first person killed that day at Columbine High School was < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . A little kindness can go a long way . So start a chain reaction . \ 
\I have this theory that if one person can go out of their way to show compassion then it will start a chain reaction of the same . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > "
