When you hear the banjo music .... that means run . 
La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo 
It's time to nut up or shut up . 
It's not about changing the world . It's about doing our best to leave the world the way it is . It's about respecting the will of others and believing in your own . This is good , Isn't it ?

Your mind is a weapon . Your mind is a blanket against cold . A shield against fear . It can beat heat , overcome hunger , eradicate pain . You can train your body to turn soft flesh into hard muscle . But if you want to know what it takes to earn the beret , start with what is under it . 
Happy 4th July ! \ 
Gotta love illegal fireworks !

Best Birthday ever ... nuff said . 
CAUTION : While on the marching band field watch out for flying stairs . 
Man ... I haven't been this calm and happy in a long time . 
In this proud land we grew up strong . \ 
We were wanted all along . \ 
I was taught to fight , taught to win . \ 
I never thought I could fail . 
I can't get my mind off it ... 
I think I dropped my wallet outside the band room and when I went back to look for it it wasn't there . If anyone sees it , tell me . 
One wallet gained , but pride lost ... 
I don't really know about myself sometimes ... 
Band competition today . GET SOME !!! 
They wanted it and we brought it . Grand Champions ! 
This is good , isn't it ? 
It's one of those time where I feel like sitting in my back yard and listen to music ... it's actually not that cold .

I'm going to put up one hell of a fight for this .

Woke up at 5:00 am and feel'n awesome . Going down to MTSU for the last band competition of the year . WE GOT THIS !!! 
I've gone well over 24 hours with no sleep ... my feet hurt . 
It's funny how something bad can happen and then one person can come and make you feel better . Life is a funny thing . 
Black Ops just blew my mind ... Damn ... 
Started up at 5:20 am , saw the sunrise , and helped clean a deer . Good day so far ! 
About 30 seconds away from putting a bullet through the freak'n bongos I keep hearing ... Damn stoner rednecks ... 
Coming home today ... but I am coming home a champion ! 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
\I did not tell half of what i saw for i knew i would not be believed . \"" 
People keep telling me that it's like i dropped off the face of the Earth ... What ? 
42 inches of WIN . 
I just fell and slid down my street ... 
I HATE CLOUDS ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
Why is Gran Torino such an awesome movie ? 
What the hell is wrong with me ... 
Where the hell did the snow come from ?! I looked outside one minute and there was less than a centimeter , Now there is almost an inch ... 
Just got the living hell scared out of me by my alarm clock and I actually fell out of my bed but that doesn't matter because NO SCHOOL !!! 
Bros .... nuff said . 
Just watched The Green Hornet . I see why people loved it ... IT . WAS . AWESOME . 
Ehhh ... 
They've given you a number and taken away your name . 
I'm so angry that I'm actually shaking . I'M DONE . 
It think there was a misunderstanding with my last status ... xD 
This is why I don't take naps . Layed down on my bed at 7 and woke up at 10 thinking \Wait what !? \ " ... Not to mention missing the UK game . " 
It snows in Lexington and rains in Richmond . Just my luck ... 
Late night White Castle run . 
When Fergie started singing sweet child o mine I think I died a little on the inside ... 
I still say last years half time show was better . 
PACKERS !!!!!! 
Just got chased around a car by a fat Asian kid ... 
I feel like hell ... 
Well crap ...
