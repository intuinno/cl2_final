He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command . 
Men ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed , for if you merely offend them they take vengeance , but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate , so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared . \ 
- Niccolo Machiavelli 
anyone trying to sell their car ? let me know 
first day of work .... bring it ! >=] 
I'm not interested in preserving the status quo ; I want to overthrow it . 
' everybody dies but not ? everybody lives ' 
gettin thru the day on 4 hours of sleep , had a final exam at 9 and got work from 4- 10:30 ish hahaha no regrets tho especially when i spent it with friends and the woman i love =] \everybody dies but not everyone lives \"" 
If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared .
