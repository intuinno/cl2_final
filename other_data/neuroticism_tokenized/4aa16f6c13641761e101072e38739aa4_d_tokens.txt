Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support .

Crying . 
watching Mulan for the fourth time in a row ;) 
For a long time we've been\ 
marching off to battle\

Band Directors are awesome but they can be nazis on the field when they have to , and the next minute they're your bff . 
A definition of a BAND DORK : The annoying kids who are in Band just for the ' easy A ' . Disliked by Band Geeks and Band Nerds , but on decent terms with the Choir Dweebs and Orchestra Nerds ( on average . Another term for Concert Bandies ) 
This is our life . \ 
\Hey 
Band O ' Asians :\ 
Packs of people of the asian persuasion . Can be found lurking in their natural habitat , collegiate libraries , on the first night of classes . Also at 2 am on a Friday night . \

Watch out , theeeyy'lll getcha .

They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me\ 
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed\ 
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\ 
Maybe they'll leave you alone , but not me\ 
The boys and girls in the clique\ 
The awful names that they stick\ 
You're never gonna fit in much , kid\ 
But if you're troubled and hurt\ 
What you got under your shirt\ 
Will make them pay for the things that they did

We were meant to be , supposed to be , but we lost it\ 
And all of the memories , so close to me , just fade away\ 
All this time you were pretending\ 
So much for my happy ending 
Slice slice slice you up\ 
Ima Monster !!! \ 
( hahaha ) \ 
;D 
Fer sure maybe fer sure not ... fer sure EH fer sure BOMB :D 
I wish i could rage within my house w/o getting yelled at for being too loud /: 
Can someone drive me somewhere peas ? D: * sniff * 
I guess < PROPFEMALE > was right ... once you start doing that stuff to yourself , you'll never stop . 
When you're gone\ 
The pieces of my heart are missing you\ 
The face I came to know is missing too\ 
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it ok\ 
I miss you\ 
....... whenever I see the video to this The Old Man touches me the most ): 
I want to adopt a cat and name it Mushu from the movie Mulan ^-^ 
for those who don't know i fainted this morning and wasn't allowed to come to school today /: 
nothing better to do on a weekend than play Sengoku Basara : Samurai Heroes :D 
Owie , my heart just got wounded again . Why do I attract all the wrong guys ? 
Take me to infinity , whoa ! 
What time is it ???? :D 
I am so misunderstood by so many people . Just stop , wait , and listen to what I have to say . 
meh 
You are the one the one that lies close to me\ 
Whisper's hello I miss you , I miss you\ 
I fell in love , in love with you suddenly\ 
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms\ 
Our lips , can touch\ 
And our cheeks , can brush\ 
Our lips can touch here 
I have mastered The < PROPMALE > of Frying Bacon !!!! 
Oh , well imagine\ 
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor\ 
And I can't help but to hear\ 
No , I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words\ 
\What a beautiful wedding ! \ 
Trust in my , self-righteous suicide\ 
I cry when angels deserve to die 
I love the song Monsoon by Tokio Hotel ...... it always calms me down 
I'm so . addicted . to . playing . Black Ops . O_O 
Level Up ! Now Currently Level 20 . Skill Aquired : Can now play Black Ops 
I'm lost and lonely\ 
Scared and hiding\ 
Blind without you\ 
When the the world comes crashing down\ 
And the skies begin to fall , I'll wait for you\ 
When the days grow old and long\ 
And my skin turns into stone , I'll wait for you 
I want to reschedule St. Valentines Day .... 
Getting minutes for mah phone today :D 
After a year and a half im back to playing Wonderland Online :3

You wanna trade cards ? \ 
Darn right ! I wanna trade\ 
Cards , I'll trade this\ 
But not my Charazard ! 
I'm hungry and there is nothing to eat in this house besides eggs and spam ..... 
If arm circles were a human being , I would punch it in the mouth . 
Tales as old as time\ 
Songs that always rhyme\ 
Beauty and the Beast .... (: \ 
i wish i was in that fairytale and had my own beast to tame :3 
Went bowling with < PROPFEMALE > last night and got my first 4 strikes of my life ! :D 
I feel so imprisoned . 
It was the middle of that night , when i heard you took your life\ 
You were slowly changing , slowly changing to black and white 
Going to Hot Topic today ! :D 
im so fricking happy ..... I got a lot of clothes at Hot Topic today because there was a < PROPMALE > clearance there and my new boots were made for killing (; 
choking on a warhead sucks ... 
First : My mom is pissed off for some reason just because it's cold out and she never wanted to come to the Lunch with mom thing . And Mr. Kegley yelled at me for not getting a worksheet , but I was in my locker getting something i asked to get before he blew up on me . Finally : My dad is yet again drinking ..... and I thought my life was getting better . 
guard went by really fast ..... can't wait for thursday :D 
Myla-isms : Nothing like taking a \Fruit Break\ " in the middle of February ! "

Walking to April's Birthday party ...... I must brave this journey !!! 
I'm so happy ..... because I can't wait to see you tomorrow ... and you know who you are (; 
The Best Part of Today : When you held my hand :) 
I like you lots (: Biddy < PROPMALE > 
I just noticed my bangs look similar to Sakon's in Naruto ..... ( O______O ) 
' Cause everytime we touch , I feel the static . \ 
And everytime we kiss , I reach for the sky . \ 
Can't you hear my heart beat so ... \ 
I can't let you go . \ 
Want you in my life . \ 
Your arms are my castle , your heart is my sky . \ 
They wipe away tears that I cry . \ 
The good and the bad times , we've been through them all . \ 
You make me rise when I fall . 
I'm not gunna cry . I'm not gunna cry . I'm not gunna cry . ...... I cried ( TToTT ) 
I feel excited about tonight ... then again I feel doubtful ): 
@Biddy < PROPMALE > : I'm finished drawing him ! (^//////^) 
-At Guard Practice-\ 
( Myla laughs hysterically)\ 
Sheridan : I want whatever myla's on . \ 
Myla : I snorted some rice before I came here ..... 
Not going to skate night because there are better things in life .... like hanging out with < PROPFIRST > and practicing my guard routine with mi fwends :D 
Get your butt into that kitchen and make me a sammich .... 
Te quiero ..... :) 
Your Lips are soft ..... tehe ( o///////o )

Our lips can touch here\

The ' special sauce ' came from the floor ! \ 
Guess what our special ' drop ' was in our Egg Drop Soup and win a free meal !! \ 
Your colon will self destruct in five seconds . \ 
A recent prison escapee that is sitting near by wants to love you long time . \ 
See the waiter about our new food poison life insurance policies . \ 
MSG ? NO !! Ebola Virus .... maybe 
I miss the marching band's trip to Disney World ( TT^TT ) 
@Biddy < PROPMALE > Get back here so we could cuddle ..... NAO O_O 
I'm doing bowling for < PROPFIRST > next year fer sure :D 
When you kiss your boyfriend in the rain , it's like the \you won the lottery\ " feeling :) " 
I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles\ 
In our eyes are mirror images and when\ 
We kiss they're perfectly aligned\ 
And I have to speculate that God himself\ 
Did make us into corresponding shapes like\ 
Puzzle pieces from the clay\ 
Biddy < PROPMALE > Goodnight < PROPFIRST > (: <3 
Aparrently < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Bowman's new nickname is \Chupa Chups\ " and < PROPFEMALE > Burke's is \ " Chulupa\ " :D " 
Going to our Band concert tonight instead of guard practice ..... I Think I feel indifferent about all of this 
Where's Biddy < PROPMALE > ???? T T-T T 
How can you tell which kid on a playground is the child of a trombonist ? He doesn't know how to use the slide , and he can't swing

I hate going to church every crapping week . If my mom makes me go forever , sooner or later I'm going to turn into an atheist . 
< PROPFEMALE > Oppenheimer \That's how we like our men . Quiet and they don't say anything \"" 
You are the reason why I live on .

Standing on the rooftops , everybody scream your heart out . 
Well today at our last competition in < PROPMALE > , we did exceptional . I say this because We first started out with a 40-ish score at our first competition this season , but we ended up with a 79.3 . You may think its no big deal , but really , that is freaking awesome !!!!!! 
Everyone at my school hates my boyfriend just because he has long hair . BULLSHIT O_O He's super sweet and kind . It's not like he carries the Bubonic Plague .

Schnitzal : (._.) Rada ? 
Dead I am the life , dig into the skin\ 
Knuckle crack the bone , 21 to win\ 
Dead I am the dog , hound of hell you cry\ 
Devil on your back , I can never die\ 
Dig through the ditches , \ 
And burn through the witches\ 
I slam in the back of my\ 
Dragula 
Another day without you with me\ 
Is like a blade that cuts right through me\ 
But I can wait\ 
I can wait forever\ 
When you call my heart stops beating\ 
When you're gone it wont stop bleeding\ 
I can wait forever 
Punching inanimate objects are the perfect cure for frustration and anger issues 
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette , \ 
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet , \ 
Out from the window see her back drop silhouette , \ 
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget , 
I hate it when I get tagged in the \Fun In Your Name\ " crap ._. " 
After School Naps make me feel like its the weekend :D 
I feel horrible and emotionally drained . 
I'm upset beyond words . 
Biddy Bradley : If I was born a guy , I would go gay for you . ;3

Stayed home again today and played FF < PROPFEMALE > Chronicles & Mortal Kombat :D went to the doctor's too and found out I had pharyngitus 
Trolling : Being a prick on the internet because you can . Typically unleashing one or more cynical or sarcastic remarks on an innocent by-stander , because it's the internet and , hey , you can . 
When I was a kid , I used to get so excited because the Disney DVDS i borrowed had minigames . 
Do you wear your sunglasses at night ? 
Went home early today because I officially have strep throat and i am on quarantine until Sunday , im highly contagious too . Which means No bowling club , No < PROPFIRST > , and No Winter Guard Party . THIS FUCKING SUCKS . 
Arguing with Cleverbot is just awesome . 
Hopefully < PROPFIRST > could teach me how to do Screamo soon :3 
Of course \We Butter the Bread with Butter\ " .... " 
Myla : -achoo-\ 
Anthony : Here , ~ hands tissue ~ \ 
Myla : I'm not that kind of sneezer ! 
Japan has it's priorities straight ! they probably invest billions of < PROPFEMALE > into marching programs , unlike the US who is trying to cut the arts altogether ? 
Bring out the old guilliotine and we'll show you what we all mean .

If I was your vampire , \ 
Certain as the moon , \ 
Instead of killing time , \ 
We'll have each other\ 
Until the sun . \ 
Death waits for no one . \ 
Hold my hands\ 
Across your face , \ 
Because I think\ 
Our time has come . 
Shame on you Black Ops ..... you keep me away from Facebook too long ):

I wanna rip your repulsive mouth from your face . 
I just can't trust anybody anymore . 
Biddy Bradley : The drive home was romantic last night :3
