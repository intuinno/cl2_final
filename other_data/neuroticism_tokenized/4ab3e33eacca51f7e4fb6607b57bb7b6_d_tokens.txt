Good Morning Sunshine ! :) 
No , it won't all go the way it should ... but i know the heart of life is good .

I met a girl named Tara\ 
And she lived in the heart of America\ 
She liked black caddies , \ 
Listened to Puff Daddy\ 
And danced until her legs were sore . \ 
hahaha FM Static anyone ? :) 
Facebook , why do you tempt me so ? Never ask a girl like me \What's on your mind ? \ " unless we've both got some time on our hands ... " 
So ... does anyone else sit around with their roomie , watch CMT music videos and- IN THE SAME ROOM- communicate via IM . haha I hate that I am from a generation that sees that I normal . I feel like such a Ham !

Weekend ! Here I come ! :) 
I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy\ 
I've been living on coffee and nicotine\ 
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen\ 
Were ever real , were ever really happening\ 
Everyday is a winding road\ 
I get a little bit closer\ 
Everyday is a faded sign\

Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal ; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE >

Grace and Peace , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Alysse 
Stars when you shine , You know how I feel\ 
Scent of the pine , You know how I feel\

It's a new < PROPFEMALE > , It's a new day , It's a new life\ 
... and I'm Feelin ' Good ! :) 
... Get up , Get out , Get away from these liars\ 
' cause they don't get your soul or your fire ... 
I am still living with your ghost , lonely and dreaming of the west coast . I don’t want to be your downtime , I don’t want to be your stupid game ... 
I have it , on good authority , there is an unmarked grey Ford Taurus in < PROPMALE > pullin people over ! Don't get busted . 
Red letter day and I'm in a blue mood\ 
Wishing that blue would just < PROPFEMALE > me away\ 
I've been talking to God \ 
don't know If it's helping or not\ 
But surely something has got to- got to- got to give , \ 
Cause I can't keep waiting to live\ 
How far do I have to go to get to you ? 
Lord , Thanks . Seriously .... thank you . 
Save tonight , And fight the break of < PROPFEMALE > , Come tomorrow , Tomorrow I'll be gone 
Buying bread from a man in Brussels . He was six foot four and full of muscle . I said , \Do you speak-a my language ? \ " He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich \ 
Coffee ... please save me ... 
DESK JOBS ARE HELLA LAME ! 
It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke\ 
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony\ 
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars\ 
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe 
If you'll be my bodyguard \ 
I can be your long lost pal \ 
I can call you < PROPFEMALE > \ 
And < PROPFEMALE > when you call me \ 
You can call me < PROPMALE > \ 
Call me < PROPMALE > 
Tomorrow I am moving out of my office and into a cubicle ... weeeak ! How am I gonna facebook now !? 
Hope dangles on a string\ 
Like slow spinning redemption\ 
Winding in and winding out\ 
The shine of it has caught my eye ... 
The time has come for colds , and over coats . We're quiet on the ride , we're all just waiting to get home . Another week away , my greatest fear . I NEED the smell of summer , I NEED it's noises in my ear !

oh You're So Condescending\ 
your Gall Is Never Ending\ 
we Don't Want Nothin ' , Not A Thing From You\ 
your Life Is Trite And Jaded\ 
boring And Confiscated\ 
if That's Your Best , Your Best Won't Do We're not gonna take it ! NO ! We aint gonna take it ! We're not gonna take it anymore ! 
Be a best friend , tell the truth , and overuse I love you\ 
Go to work , do your best , don't outsmart your common sense\ 
Never let your prayin knees get lazy\ 
And love like crazy 
... It's the little things :) 
They said change your clothes , She said no I won't\ 
They said comb your hair , She said some kids don't\ 
And her parents dreams went up in smoke ... 
I've got some good people that care alot about me . Thank you guys . :) 
How do you piss Lady Gaga off ? \ 
You Po-Po-Poke her face , Poke her face ! 
I DONT KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT !! 
You know what they say about people who ASSUME ... it makes an ASS out of U-M-E 
I need to forget what I want and try to remember what I deserve . 
It's cold inside , but deep in the night . \ 
The light is bright enough to save the weakest ones but you're in the running . \ 
Oh don't you give up or fade away . 
Once this wears off ... I am going to be faaaaar too < PROPMALE > over ... 
I got this . :) 
I wish I was driving way too fast in my car with the windows down and singing all my favorite songs at the top of my lungs RIGHT NOW ! ... Who's with me ? 
It's amazing how your confidence swells when your purse matches your shoes . :) 
Here's a simplification of everything I'm going through :\ 
You + Me is baaaaaad news . \ 
Youre a lovely creation , I like to think that I am too , \ 
But my friends said , I look better without you . 
I have figured it out ! I am pretty sure we are living our weeks inversely to the way God intended . I would work my ass off if I only had to do it for 3 days ! AND if i had a full 5 days to have fun and be productive ... work seems like such a waste of time ... Oh Monday , how I loathe you . 
Anything other than yes is no , \ 
Anything other than stay is go , \ 
Anything less than ' I love you ' is lying . 
Pain throws your heart to the ground\ 
Love turns the whole thing around\ 
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood\ 
But I know the heart of life is good\ 
I know it's good 
Last night was fun . :) I think my body is remembering how to function with 3-5 hours of sleep on the regular . . . eh , I'll sleep when I'm dead . 
Good Morning World ! 
Singing songs from the balcony as the city crumbles\ 
Under the powers of an evil doctor rocket science monster \ 
with capabilities to destroy the entire universe !! 
I am soooo pleased it is friday ! :) 
Leaving work early :) Niiiiice . Have a good weekend everyone ! xoxo 
Let the Good Times Roll :) 
' cause I'm a voodoo child\ 
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child baby I want to say one more last thing \ 
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time \ 
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days . 
I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming ... 
What a peaceful Monday . :) 
If it were not for the bag of Circus Animal Cookies in the break room , I’d be having a REALLY bad day ... 
Western Title Customer appreciation lunch today . The theme , Western Days ... :) I am so gonna be there . 
What a day ... 
Not worth it ? ... What the hell is wrong with you ?

I am soooooo close to a REALLY good weekend ... Come on 5 o'clock! :) \ 
Enjoy the weekend friends ! :) 
I'm realizing more and more . Life is simple if you break free from those who don't know love . You reap what you sow . :) Think about it and plant carefully .

MUST SLEEP . shut up thoughts , exist quieter please . 
I AM going to have a good day . \

HAPPY 08-09-10 ! :) 
I don't need this ... 
* High Five * 
I am aiming to be somebody that somebody trusts \ 
with her delicate soul I don't claim to know much \ 
except soon as you start to make room for the parts That aren't you , \ 
it gets harder to bloom in a garden of love , love , love , love 
What a good way to start the day :) 
I am going to walk out that door in 20 minutes and just start singing LOUDLY ! I have been suppressing the juke box in my head ALL day and its making me crazy !!

Red Wine at work ! Oh hell yeah . Best Friday the 13th ever ! ( and I have a few really good ones ... ) :) :) 
We're so scared to find out what this life's all about , \ 
so scared we're gonna loose it and knowing all along , \ 
that's exactly what we need . 
I'd rather forget and not slow down\ 
Than gather regret for the things I can't change now\ 
If I become what I can't accept\ 
Resurrect the saint from within the wretch 
It’s funny how you find you enjoy your life\ 
when you’re happy to be alive . :) 
ITS RAINING ! 
Still Saucey :) 
Say that you're into me , let me know how it will be\ 
If you don't know just say so\ 
I'll wait till the perfect time think of all the perfect lines\ 
I'll make sure if I let you know 
Oh my goodness , Oh my goodness !

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Re-post if this made you smile . 
The < PROPFEMALE > gave the bagpipes to the Scots as a joke , but the Scots haven't seen the joke yet ...
