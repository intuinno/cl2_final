I will be completely honest for 24 hours , you can ask me anything ( inbox only ) . I will answer no matter what , you have my complete honesty . But I dare you to put this as your status and see what questions you're asked . 
I should have held on to my pride\ 
I should have never let you lie\ 
I guess you got what you deserved\ 
I guess I should've been more like her\ 
Forgiving you , she's stronger than I am\ 
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at\ 
It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth\ 
You love her and she loves you with all she has\ 
I guess I should've been more like that 
the hardest part is saying goodbye ... 
will play the number game . Send me a Facebook message containing a number , and I will proclaim by feelings about you to the world ( with the post containing your number so you will know I'm talking about you , though you'll otherwise remain anonymous ) .

' You don't know my past and I don't have a future figured out . And maybe this is going to fast . And maybe it's not meant to last . But what do you say to taking chances ? What do you say to jumping off the edge ? Never knowing if there's solid ground below . Or a hand to hold or hell to pay . What do you say ? ' 
tomorrow night I will be cleaning out my friends for the new year if you survive cool if not there is either a . ) a good reason behind it or b . ) I was moody and not happy with you for some reason or another if you are curious as to which is the reason ask and I will answer if you could care less then just don't worry about it k thanks bye ...

You dont have to feel like a waste of space youre original cannot be replaced if you only knew what the future holds after a hurricane comes a rainbow . Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed so you can open one that leads you to the perfect road . Like a lightning bolt your heart will blow and when it's time youll know . You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine just own the night like the 4th of July . 
well that’s the way the < PROPFEMALE > tale goes\ 
boy meets girl and they wed with roses\ 
but that’s not the way it seems to be\ 
and I’m pissed that they lied to me\ 
cuz boy meets boy and boy runs away\ 
or girl meets girl and she’s afraid to stay\ 
we end up home alone watching court tv\ 
not living ever after happily 
how many strawberries did we squeeze in ? 22 ! plus 1 1/3 bananas . we used geometry .... and a mallet . 
stupid < PROPFIRST>'s day .... 
wants to go to a fraternity formal someone ask him k k thanks bye .... 
I'd listen to her\ 
Cause I know how it hurts\ 
When you lose the one you wanted\ 
Cause he's taking you for granted\ 
And everything you had got destroyed\ 
It's a little too late for you to come back\ 
Say it's just a mistake , \ 
think i'd forgive you like that\ 
If you thought I would wait for you\ 
you thought wrong 
Ya know I'm sick of following my dreams man I'm just going to ask them where they're going and hookup with them later .

my life is now a sick joke I have finally come down with the sickness .... I've caught the BIEB FEVE !!!!... in fairness his acoustic cd is awesome ... 
I just can't sleep tonight , knowing that things ain't right . It's in the papers , it's on the TV , it's everywhere that i go . Children are crying , soldiers are dying , some people don't have a home . But i know there's sunshine behind that rain , I know there's good times behind that pain . Can you tell me how i can make a change ? I close my eyes , and i can see a better day , I close my eyes and pray .
