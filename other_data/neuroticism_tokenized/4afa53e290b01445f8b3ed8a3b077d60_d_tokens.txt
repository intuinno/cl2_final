WHAT UP 2011 

You know what ? \ 
St. < PROPFIRST > . Done . 
Congrats Vinny and Emilo ! Relentless Ironman Champs ' 10 ! It was like I was one of the fucking civilians on No Russian . A big thanks to Sludgie the Whale for egging them on at the end . Now my back looks like < PROPFIRST > Ejiogu's face ( <3 blacks ) . 
Shoveling snow ...... 
Remember children , Mr. Coradin would like to remind you that a single vibratory disturbance that moves from point to point in a medium is called a pulse . 
Remember children , Mr. Coardin would also like to remind you that in a longitudanal wave the vibration and wave travel in the same direction . On the other hand , a transversal wave place the vibration perpendicular to the wave's motion . 
Remember children , Mr. Coradin would very much like to remind you that in a case in which a wave transfers into a new medium , some of the wave reflects , some of it is absorbed , and the rest is transmitted . 
No more Mr. Coradin jokes for me . Doing his homework does that to a man . 
Overtoasted English Muffin- 1 Gums- 0 
I will never again have EZ Cheese . Going home today was a harrowing experience because of it . 
Happy Easter to all ! 
Listening to Avenged Sevenfold while researching how a three-dimensional object would appear to a two-dimensional viewer . God damn I love physics ! 
Life is like the uncertantity principle : everything is whithin a cloud of probability , but when an event occurs that cloud of probability shrinks to 100% within that event . 
Drinking with < PROPFIRST > Cahill is akin to going to prom with your mom . It's an embarassment to all of us . 
I hate it when my torrents are as slow as a Ryken kid . 
\Sitting on an angry chair [ ... ]\ 
Happy Mothers Day to all the baby mommas in the hood . 
So yesterday I ate 14 White Castle Brugers and destroyed a toilet . Today I got over 20 calls from 5 different < PROPFIRST > and a good 22 or so hugs . Best week evar ? 
God , I wish the weekends would last a bit longer . 
Xaverian SCC president elections ........ Sick one . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Blackhawks and Flyers tonight . 
If you know any over weight people , ask them if they would like to get physically fit and financially fit as well and have them email either Jp3599036@hotmail.com , or arkainangel@yahoo.com 
Facebook at school ..... light . 
Fuck Paraguay 
Toy Story 3 = Epic 
Happy Father's Day ! 
No . More . Regents . 
Wants a crave crate right now . 
Saw the sickest thing today . Apparently there is a new tablet coming out that runs on Android that is going to completely rape the iPad . It has practically all of the features of the $800 iPad for about $300 and still includes more . Don't rest on your laruels Apple , the Netpad is coming . 
Using my Pre-Release version of the Netpad . For a beta , I can say it's great . However , I can't wait for the retail version to release with the small bug fixes I requested . 
No Xaverian for me next year . Tightness . Well it's been a great three years with everyone , I'll try to visit you guys during the school year . On a side note , I got a fauxhawk for shits and giggles . 
Wants to go to Uproar . 
Oh Marlboro High School you kid me . Summer reading assignment : Tuesdays with Morry . Date school starts : Next Friday . I feel like Huck Finn taking this shit easy . 
UPROAR ! \ 
A7X was kickass , and Halestorm was pretty nice too . However I was a \ 
little disappointed at Disturbed . They could have put on a much better \ 
show than they did . :( But don't tell < PROPMALE > and Elea I said that :D \ 
Also : < PROPFIRST > YOU HAVE MY HALESTORM CD ! 
NHL 11 around the corner , lets gooooo . 
Marlboro High School - This institution of learning is filled to the brim with students and was most likely designed by an architect with a crack addiction . In other words , the hallways are filled wall to wall and put together in a retarded maze like structure . Needless to say . traversing this environment is a great hassle . 
I'm bored . I think I'll go learn Python or something . 
Just had an absolutely terrible dream . Never letting my kid within a 20 foot radius of a God damned tree house . 
Two things I don't want to meet anytime soon :\ 
The Brazilian wandering spider\ 
Goliath Bird Eating Spider\ 
Seriously . If there is a God , he is one sadistic bastard . 
PICKING UP REACH AT 12 
The Federalist #51 is the driest thing I have have ever read , interpreted , and outlined . Ever . It is dryer than eating wood shavings with cottonmouth . 
Children with special needs only want what we all want - to be accepted . Can I make a request of anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children who learn a little differently . 
Sigh . The combination of ADD and OCD is killing my essay writing . I can't bring myself to complete my paragraph patterns damn it . Got to follow that 7 8 10 8 10 7 . 
Doing my AP US Government homework and I stumbled upon this interesting statistic :\ 
In a period of fifteen years , the number of block grants had a net increase of eleven . \ 
In a period of two years , the number of categorical grants had a net increase of forty . \ 
Oh Federal government , you never cease to amaze me with those long arms of yours . 
When I say \yeah sick one\ " in New Jersey people look at me if I have twelve heads . God damn force of habit ! " 
Leaving Brooklyn today . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > Kaykaty , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Talpak and the crew better chill with me next time . I've seen everyone but your asses . 
Alright , as part of my psychology homework I am supposed to poll my friends on a social networking site ( i.e. Facebook ) and collect some data . \ 
\ 
I need you to :\ 
1 . Post your age\ 
2 . Post your opinion on whether it is nature or nurture ( inherited traits vs environmental influence ) that causes someone to be the way they are ( sociopathic , apathetic , etc . ) . \ 
3 . Briefly explain the rationale behind your opinion . 
Mafioso or bratva for Halloween ? 
Just got two shots so I don't end up like FDR . Going out with my Mafioso getup later . 
Watched \The Walking Dead\ " on AMC . Pretty good shit if you ask me . " 
A big < PROPFIRST > on the back to all those fulfilling their civic duties and voting today in the midterm elections . However , if you are going to vote just to vote and aren't educated on what is at stake here , it might be best for you to stay at home . \ 
Also , PROP 19 ! 
Prop 19 better pull through . 
I thought a visit to the optometrist is supposed to correct your vision , not render you unable to read . FML 
I hate calling customer support . Companies need to stop outsourcing to < PROPFEMALE > and let me speak to someone who actually knows my language and actually knows the product they are supposed to provide support for . 
COICA was shot down . There still is some good in the world ! 
Today I'd like to thank those Native < PROPFEMALE > ns who took the blankets from those kind settlers . Without them , the seeds of < PROPFEMALE > would never have been planted . 
Hooked up the old NES in my brother < PROPFIRST>'s room . Played some classics and showed him how to beast at Duck Hunt . Best bro signing in . 
My plans for Friday ? Frieeeed . 
They legit need a train from Marlboro to Bay Ridge . 
32:19 / 57:30 Survival Mode in Beat Hazard for < PROPFEMALE > in Chains ' album Dirt . God I need to get outside . 
Alright , I demand answers behind these cartoon pictures . 
Was this new profile update really neccessary ? 
The season finale of The Walking Dead wasn't all that good . Hopefully season two will make up for the lackluster ending . 
A normal person has 1,000 wishes . A Soldier only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you wont post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died , a wounded warrior , or who is fighting for your freedom , please re-post 
Just checked out my new villa in Monteriggioni . Pretty classy . 
AP psych book arrived , this is going to be a fun few months . 
\I'm the most dangerous man in this prison . You know why ? ' Cause I control the underwear . \"" 
Go to check my SAT score the second it hits twelve . Grades aren't posted yet . Story of my life . 
AP Physics + Shit loads of crazy demos + \Tub of Fun\ " = Best Class ever\ 
Is it just me or do more and more ATMs accept stray cats nowadays ? 
Oh God I love snow 
Another bro moment with < PROPMALE > Perfetto . Place fist on screen . 
Oh what's this ? Marlboro's We The People team made it to states ? \ 
Get at us Jersey . 
How can you have your pudding if you don't eat your meat ? 
I nominate < PROPFIRST > Gallis for bad ass of the year . Anything less would be a step down . 
Jets , I am disappoint . 
What a horrible night to have a curse ! 
Yeah , it's overwhelming , but what else can we do . \ 
Get jobs in offices , and wake up for the morning commute . 
I find it pretty interesting that nearly all of the top rated questions on Youtube's \Interview with the President\ " have to do with legalizing marijuana and other drugs . " 
Obama YT interview . This should be interesting . 
Yeah man , walking from Flatbush to Bergen Beach waist deep in slush and shit water . Yeah I really missed all of this . 
Red Bean , Chocolate , Green Tea , and Banirrrrra . 
Me : .. and we had the shootings in Tuscon , Arizona where the shooter used a semi-automa-\ 
Judge : But it's legal ! \ 
Me : Shooting people is legal ?

RIP to all the trees that died so I can print out my Gov notes . \ 
I can almost use this stack to < PROPFIRST > up a God damn car . 
Earthquakes\ 
Tsunamis\ 
Reactor failures\ 
... and volcanic eruptions at Shinmoedake . \ 
Face it guys , Japan is gone . 
Thank God for < PROPFEMALE > Black . If it wasn't for her , I would have NEVER known the days of the week . Good job making it so easy to remember ! 
Buying stock in URRE . I have faith that the nuclear disasters in Japan are going to make this a choice energy alternative in the near future . 
Happy International-Get-Wasted-and-Bar-Fight day ! 
This is a Public Service Announcement :\ 
Today is Saturday , tomorrow will be Sunday . \ 
Thank you for for your time . 
St. Johns , $ 11,000 . Currently 1/1 
I can never get tired of watching My Cousin Vinny 
Is hiccuping for fourteen hours a bad thing ? I am pretty sure it's a bad thing . Oh well . 
Two days straight of hiccuping . I've learned some crazy ass remedies through this experience . 
Conquered those hiccups . Looks like < PROPFIRST > Osborn gets to keep his record . 
Fuck the Caps 
Three kinds of people I want to fight with my hands before I die :\ 
- White Supremacist\ 
- Politician\ 
- Fundamentalist 
Really Rangers ? 
\Why would we die in 2012 when we have Yogurt the expires in 2013\ " \ 
Rangers smh 
Well there is always next season ... 
Well any argument saying that the PS3 has better online service than the Xbox is just shot now . To all you PS3 owners with PSN accounts : somebody hacked PSN and has a list of every members name , address , passwords , and credit card information . Pretty much , if you signed up for PSN , you're fucked . 
Now that I think about it , the kid from MGMT's Kids music video is probably had to go through some therapy or some shit after shooting . 
\MONDAY IT'S GOING TO BE A NEW CLASS . BE PREPARED . \ " \ 
Today marks the day that the longest running game of Hide and Seek is over . Move over < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , Osama Bin Laden just took your record . 
Alright Hock , challenge accepted . Senior paper in one day .
