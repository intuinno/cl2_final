who you are isn't how you treat yourself and others , that's the means for an end . And the end is who you are because that is what you want ; What you want is what's in your heart .. so you see , changing how you get what you want , how you live your life , and how you treat yourself and others , is only changing the means for the end , so you are still the same , because your desires have not changed .

NOW IS THE TIME TO APPLY TO JOBS . THE WORK IS COMING IN BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER ... I THINK . BUT SERIOUSLY . DO IT . 
Umm , i don't know what just happened last night but i saw an amazing dark , eerie , moody video montage to some awesome music followed by the title \Twilight\ " and credits of an equally amazing backdrop of rippling water in winter/autumn woods . Is this what chicks are raving about ? Cause that would be in REALLY good taste if that is the case ! Ok now i have to see this .. " 
what's the point of holidays ? thanksgiving - special day to eat alot , easter - useless , christmas - special day to buy stuff , birthdays - a way for idiots to keep track of their age , halloween - special day where sluts and pedos are okay , i could go on but as you can see holidays are pointless in this modern age . 
o ... My .. god ... It is so nice out tonight ... I cant believe it ... I could just stroll leisurely like this through the streets all night .. *__* 
I wanna see someone animate not on 2's not on 1's but on . 5's .... that's right .. 60fps mofos !! now THAT would be sick . 
cant tell if someone was born in ny ? Here's an easy way to tell .. Plaid .. Nyers cant get enough of plaid ! At some point every nyer under the age of 30 decided to change their religion to plaidianity where god judges you by how often you wear plaid , disagree with people , and argue furiously about train routes . Just watch them , u will see what i am talking about . 
here's what guys dont realize and forget about women : for women , love is a CAREER , not some tail at the end of your life that you could live without - do you realize that in the heterosexual world , because women outnumber us that that means that for them the phrase \there's somebody for everybody\ " doesnt actually hold true !!?? .. Yet another reason women try harder and therefore are stronger .. " 
Ok now i realize why some people don't learn much about life ; It's because they're not looking for the answers . So from now on before i try to tell someone what the truth is , i will check to see if they even care to know . Just cause they complain about it doesn't mean they actually want the real solution ( despite what they believe ) . Maybe they're just not ready . The minds of men are weak . 
Clients are being very patient , thank you all , it is lovely ..

Do you find that you only feel lazy in certain rooms ? Well check the temperature and feng shui of the room . You may notice that if it's too hot you'll lose energy and just pass out all the time . Also it will help to set up your workstation so that you are not facing distractions and comfortable .. that means investing in a NICE seat and a NICE desk . The more comfortable you work , the more productive you'll be !

men and women are both equally fake ; men are freaked out when they find out women can fake orgasms perfectly , and women hate to break it to you but men are able to be the man on command . 
Work like a Korean , Love like a Latino , Be devout as a terrorist , and strong as a black woman , Indulge like a Frenchman , and be Cunning as an Indian/Israeli .. but above all else .. Dream my friends ... Dream like an American .

NYC tip of the Day : Save your money by taking the yellow cabs in lieu of the black cabs ; You'll always save money . It may seem like a plus that you can haggle with the black cabs since they don't have a meter , but i assure you , they are far better at haggling than you are or ever will be .. and what they lack in indian/jewish culture , they more than make up for with corruption and treachery .

The beautiful world around you is called Space and Time , and they are connected . If you look in all directions you can see past present and future . The most beautiful thing about time is that nobody has begun to explore it yet . No Colonies , No Territories , No Laws ! : ) 
You don't have to be smart or good at anything to do or be anything ever . You just have to WANT it and be brave enough to GO THERE .

Get your climbing gear ready people - TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL !!! RRAAAAAAAA !!!!!
