is messing around with Ocarina of Time's first beta world . Damn portals . 
wishes that his other family members could go a full hour w/o being total @$$holes . 
went shopping again and a shelf he bought has some severe welding-related problems with it . Is it really that hard for those poorly-paid workers to weld a frame together properly ?

just got back from the Original Pancake House with the fam . More wonderful packing and cleaning todayyy . 
|Debussy's Nocturnes are like ear < PROPFEMALE > . Or rather anything by Debussy . 
is hoping that his sniffles are nothing more than allergies . It's peanut butter Nyquil time .

is finding it to be increasingly difficult to Facebook-stalk people . 
|Nothing ends a day better than Lux and Nox Aurumque . 
dislikes when his relatives try to add him on FB because then he has to consider whether to change everything on his profile . On an unrelated note , I'm missing my favorite show b/c of marching band rehearsal tonight . This week just got horrible . 
stayed up this late to watch Design < PROPFEMALE > . That's how pointless my life is right now . 
hoped and prayed that once he moved out things would get better . For the most part , they have not and now similar problems exist . I need a vicoden .

wishes he would have gotten more sleep , but SOME PEOPLE found it necessary to be up until Midnight .

| I'm not a happy camper . I'm losing weight rapidly , and I can hardly keep my food down . One of my wisdom teeth may be coming in . MLIA .

has his Concert band seating audition in a few hours and his Wind Ensemble audition tomorrow , and for the most part does not think that he is as well-prepared as he should be . 
is skipping out on the Honors Banquet , as he has more important things to do like pretending to care and getting good food . 
is doing his homework and watching Hell's Kitchen . Marching band's tomorrow , so it's going to be a lackluster day . 
has got several days worth of Theory and other homeworks completed and is feeling more motivated than ever . 
started to feel very good about himself , then realized that it was his Nyquil that was making him crazy . MLIA . 
has a pointless Wind Ensemble audition at 1:16 , marching band at 3:20 , and nothing else this evening . Joy .

has an epic amount of homework to due tonight , since tomorrow is shot because of marching band . 
is supaaa tired but has a day full of marching band ahead of him . MLIA .

is off to Music and Speech to practice for a few hours =( 
couldn't make a decent < PROPMALE > to save his life . I had to end my practice session 3 hours earlier than I wanted to because I have one working < PROPMALE > that I need for Concert band , and 14 which play like total shit . FML . 
managed to make two decent reeds and is hoping his practicing schedule will get much better . 
|Some guy from the Associated Press just took a picture of me carrying my breakfast next to the memorial at < PROPFIRST > Hall and had me give him my personal information . Strangeeee . 
is slightly irritated he forgot to watch Glee last night =( 
thanks Hulu for making it possible to watch Glee - freaking hilarious . 
has \Peter and the Wolf\ " stuck in his head after attempting to prepare his orchestral excerpt . Joy . " 
| FML FML FML FML FML FML . 
|Today is one of those days that I get a random compulsion to clean everything , and so I shall . 
is tired of < PROPMALE>'s slow as all getout wifi connection ; if I'm paying 7 grand a year to stay in Sto-Jo I better see shit fly across my screen at breakneck speed . 
thinks it's rather sad he is obsessed with Glee now . 
| A weekend of work , work , and moar work . 
| Coca Cola is one of life's simple pleasures . Like Facebooking when one has homework to do . 
just heard a shawm for the first time and really wants one now . 
doesn't want to spend his entire night doing homework and practicing , and is trying to find something interesting to do . 
is trying to figure out how to a French-scrape oboe < PROPMALE > , because there are several pieces of garbage cane that need to be wasted . 
keeps telling himself that things will get better , but knows that they never will . Yay pessimism . 
has , one would never guess , WORK TO DO . 
is doing a research study for General Psychology ; it's a mass-test for males only and it asked me if I've missed any periods and if I'm on birth control . MLIA . 
doesn't want to < PROPMALE > in music anymore ... 
|After a two hour nap I still don't feel like doing anything . My diet has largely consisted of pop tarts and coke . Stress eating FTW . 
| A night of reed-making , memorizing marching band music , reading Moll Flanders , and watching the season finale of Design < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
is watching Design < PROPFEMALE > and SecondLife-ing at the same time , and is finally done with all of his work . Life is good ( for the moment ) =) 
wishes the cable wouldn't take a dive during the last 20 minutes of every episode of Design < PROPFEMALE > . Fucking someone is going to get chewed out . 
doesn't understand guys and their football . 
is cram-memorizing his marching band music for this afternoon . Fun fun fun . 
is out of milk , pop tarts , Coke , cereal , and mandarin oranges . My life may be over . 
is thinking about becoming an RA next year to offset $8000+ worth of college costs . Hopefully the time commitment won't be too bad . 
has General Psych until 8:15 , then plans on sleeping just long enough to have enough energy for some late-night practicing . 
might have to skip the Glee party to practice for his lesson + make reeds . M(oboe)LIA . 
memorized < PROPFEMALE > the Beautiful in under 20 minutes and can now focus on more important things , like reed-making and failing at melodic minor scales on the oboe . 
|Glee is a wonderful end to a mediocre day =) 
|It's Thursday , which means it's time to put up some quotes from his Honors Colloquium professor during the latest class . 
has quartet rehearsal at 8 , an two tests following that he did not study for . I have my priorities people . 
| If it wasn't for having to play clarinet later , today would've been amazing . 
just got his flu shot . His arm bled like a gunshot wound , and on top of that the nurse had no idea what an oboe was . M(oboe)LIA . 
|Oboe studio BBQ/Bonfire =) 
had a lot of fun at the BBQ . That bad < PROPMALE > cane burning in the bonfire made me feel good inside . Parents visiting tomorrow morning , then the football game =( 
is going to bitch slap those tards next door who left for the weekend and didn't un-set their alarm clock . It's been going off for over an hour . PISSSED . 
|It is a 7 cup of coffee type of morning . 
is tired as balls and doesn't want to go to marching banddddddddddddd . 
|FYE movie at the Kiva and then out bowlinggggg =)

Stay tuned for Honors Colloquium quotes at 12:30 =) 
| Honors Colloquium professor quote time =) 
needs to churn out three reeds in the next two hours ; may the reed-god help me . 
| Jesus Christ . I don't know what to doooooooooooooooooooooo . I'm debating if I should skip General Psych to go to the KKP info meeting , among other things . 
has made his decision , albeit rather reluctantly . 
doesn't know how he is going to manage to get everything done that he needs to do for tomorrow : reading , practicing , making reeds , memorizing marching band music , and studying for the General Psych exam . FML . 
|Katie is awesome . But not as awesome as Glee <3 
|Glee is the most amazing albeit predictable show I think I have ever seen . 
is studying for his General Psych exam during Colloquium . Quotes to come . 
<3 <3 <3 OBOE <3 <3 <3 General Psych exam at 7:00 , then deciding between MacGamut and Pride . 
|MacGamut makes me violently angry . Two hours of chords is not fun . 
had to turn in his ear training assignment only 2/3 done because I have to wake up bright and early for quartet rehearsal , and we didn't cover the material in class anyway . Tomorrow's butt-rape will be courtesy of the latest ear training quiz . My ears are terrible . 
| It's international \Hug a Vegetarian Day \"!" 
is quite tired . Waiting for laundry to finish . Shopping for < PROPMALE > supplies he doesn't need . Life is exciting . 
doesn't like the weekends because there are very few places that he can get noms at . 
| It better not rain during the game . Playing is the only thing that makes it interesting . 
thinks that marching , sitting , and playing in the pouring rain makes one's life true hell . 
might be exploring < PROPMALE > and doing some errands today , among other things . Text the cell . 
| Gah I have so much work to do and not enough time to procrastinate and not do it all . 
has discovered that he can hear the difference between high-bitrate VBR mp3/aac and lossless audio formats . Now if only my ears could help me not fail my ear training quizzes , life would be perfect . 
can see his ribs . That's not good . I guess it's to be expected since I don't eat junk food or meat . 
had a terrible night sleep , aided by his air conditioner which chilled the room down to 63 F . 
should be making reeds and doing Colloquium homework , but has a headache and is tired as balls . This is going to be a sucky week . 
is whittling some reeds and doing homework for Colloquim . Hopefully there's something interesting on tv tonight . Someone tell me what to watch . 
whittled three almost-finished reeds without destroying one in the process . My reed-making is finally starting to get better ! 
will be writing a Colloquium paper during Theory . That's how much I hate that class . 
is playing mellophone rather loudly and badly in his room . 
got a 96% on his Psych exam ! And he finally got a mellophone ! And he made good reeds ! Amazing day with lots of exclamation points ! 
|My schedule blows next semster . The only methods class I can fit in around my year-long classes makes it so I have class from 8:50 - 12:15 . FML . 
just did 2 minutes of MacGamut and realized I might as well take the zero . Time saved : 4 hours . 
|After a grueling hour-long discussion with my mom , I have decided to drop a few classes and stick to 19 credit hours . I will also be taking FOUR summer classes . Joy . 
loves Wednesdays . 3 hours of downtime between Music of Western Cultures and Marching band . And Gleeeeee is on later <3 
managed to not procrastinate and wrote his Colloquium paper due next week , but ended up not practicing for his lesson . Goddammit . MacGamut . Glee is awesome . 
is going to get raped by the Theory exam this morning . 
| Today has been such a great day =) now if only MacGamut would cooperate . Goddammit MacGamut . 
is having clothes-shopping withdrawal . 
keeps thinking that college isn't all it's cracked up to be , but after realizing that high school was hell he is bilssfully content . 
| When life gives you lemons , make music ... 
keeps forgetting to buy the soundtrack for \ Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog\ " . Damn I love that movie . " 
|Running back and forth all day was super tiring . The band shows did not go as well as I would have liked . Now it's Saturday night and I have nothing to do . Today officially sucks . 
' S FACEBOOK IS FINALLY FIXED ! BEST DAY EVER =) 
wishes the RA's would stop being useless and actually answer their door to turn off someone's goddamn alarm clock at balls ' o clock at night . 
wishes that there would be a marching band arrangement for \Tarkus \"; it would be quite fun . " 
| 21 credit hours next semester but no marching band =) I can finally focus on oboe as much as I want and/or need to ! 
should be going to bed but is instead obsessively listening to Tarkus . MLIA . 
|Theory practical tomorrow = rape . At least I can look forward to not having class on Friday X.x 
is watching Glee instead of studying more for his theory practical . Hopfully this week's episode will be better than last week's . 
Ughhhh Theory practical goddammit . I'm going to die . 
' s credit card number was stolen TWICE from Midwest Musical Imports ' online store . Fuck that shit . 
got raped by his theory practical , but only has one 50-minute class tomorrow so this week does indeed have redeeming qualities . 
only has one class today , which means he'll have time to ( maybe ? ) practice =) 
is taking a cat-nap before getting his car and some noms . I love having nothing band-related to do . 
| MMI upgrated the shipping on my order b/c someone stole my credit card number on their server . It got here in breakneck speed . I love my life . 
| Nothing wraps up the perfect day more than a horrible nosebleed . I didn't even dig for gold . Goddammit . 
definitely thinks it's time to go to bed .. 
is going to have a very average day of practicing three instruments , making reeds , and perhaps making a shopping trip to get some underarmour before it gets even colder . 
is going to practice some mello . 
| Every time I find a pair of panties in my laundry , I gag just a little . 
is quite bored tonight , having played through Metroid , < PROPFEMALE > , and Pokemon for the last several hours . Damn .

|Today sucked way too much for a free day . 
is thinking he will save the containers from the 1/2 gallon worth of milk he drinks per day and make a castle =) 
| It's a reed-making kind of afternoon =) 
| 3.8 for my midterm . Goddammit MacGAMUT . 
| D'ya know that feeling when you wake up and you just know it's going to be a sucky day ? EVERY DAY IS LIKE THAT :'( 
' s bad mood would not be complete without singing the oboe solo from < PROPFIRST > W . Smith's concert band adaptation of < PROPMALE>'s \Inferno \"." 
will be using the extra time this afternoon to study for his General Psychology exam tonight . 
thinks tonight will not be fun . General Psych exam in an hour , then studying for the Music of Western Cultures exam tomorrow , Goddammit MacGAMUT , and tying a < PROPMALE > for studio tomorrow . Busy busy busy ... 
| So apparently I have to know an excerpt for studio that I never found out about . Looks like it's a late night practicing session . Now I can't study for my exam . I want to flip . 
is having some serious bassoon withdrawal =( 
| Away game at OU today . Dammit . 
| Yay we won . I'm tired as hell from the 3 hour bus ride .

wishes he had the power to kill undesirables with a simple flick of his wrist ... 
is supaaaa tired but has a long day ahead of him . 
is tired of being a lousy oboe player . I should have stuck to clarinet ; I was actually GOOD at it . 
' s parents sent him a box full of < PROPFEMALE > . This day actually has some redeeming parts to it . Except now I'm obese . 
|This is one of those mornings when I want to curl up in a ball and die . But I have an ear-training quiz to fail so I might as well drink my coffee and move on . 
is feeling a little better , but not entirely . This shall be a relaxing evening full of music , cleaning , and Cops . 
| It's hard to go to a f**king Second Life Halloween party when Resnet cuts all but a fraction of my bandwidth . Damn themmmmm . 
must be the only college kid who doesn't have plans to party tonight . Doesn't mean I don't have plenty to do though =) 
has a long day full of shopping and working . 
doesn't know why he is so tired , but must motivate himself to do Theory homework , practice , and make reeds =( 
is getting blisters as a result of gouging THREE pieces of cane on the Driscoll . FML . 
is trying to find some people to live with him in Beall next year ; any ideas ? 
| Reedmaking blahhhhhhh 
| Problems with my life : 1 . I don't have enough time to practice for my lessons . 2 . I can't make reeds nearly as well as everyone thinks . 3 . I feel like I'm being driven like a performance < PROPMALE > when there's not a snowball's < PROPMALE > in hell that's going to happen . 4 . I don't have a life . 5 . I'm tired of eating prison food . 6 . I have yet to find a single person I relate to . | College is great . Yeah right . 
is sorry for making everybody listen to him bitch and complain . 
' s hands are literally battered and bruised from gouging 17 pieces of cane but now he's motivated to work as long as he needs to to get shit done . 
is very irritated that he can spend so long on reed-making without result . 
| It's snowingggggg ! :'( 
has another reed-making afternoon ; those I made yesterday sudenly decided to become pithy . M(oboe)LIA . 
is having a late-night reed-making/practice session with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . On an unrelated note , I'm going to be playing bassoon in Uni Band next semester . 
is getting a sore throat . Fuck . 
feels like s**t . Thank you to whoever got me sick . 
| Well it's the day before the Western Cultures final and I can't access the online notes because < PROPMALE > is broken . I hate my life . 
IS SICK AS HELL =( 
got sicker as a result from going to Akron , but is glad he went despite the fact that < PROPMALE > lost . 
| Shopping at Walmart just serves as a reminder that some peoples ' family trees have more branches than others . 
| No need to take my laptop to Western Cultures anymore , Jazz with < PROPMALE > is going to be awesome !!! 
is trying to decide if he should drop Frontiers in Astronomy to make his schedule a little more bearable ... 
is having the most difficult time finding a circular radius gauge with . 25 increments . Damn . 
| Instead of enjoying my day I have to practice and make reeds . Meh . 
| Looks like I won't be turning in MacGamut this week ; harmonic dictation is bull crap . 
wishes that he didn't have to go all the way to MSP to find out the gouger is MIA . Now I will probably have to make reeds during Glee =/ 
dislikes that clarinetists only have to pay $38 for a pound of tube cane while I have to pay $120 ... 
is going home tomorrow ! =) 
is finally home ! 
' s dad fixed the battery inside of my old Pokemon Gold version so now I can waste my life again ! This is a great day ... 
| < PROPFIRST > Adams ' \On the Transmigration of Souls\ " is quite a strange piece of music ... " 
| Ughhhh driving home later ... 
' s car's alternator broke again . Luckily it did it before he left home and not in the parking lot at the stadium a week later . 
is doing some pretty lousy composing right now . 
missed the meteor shower . Wahhhhhh 
| The two horrible compositions I wrote this morning are proof why I shouldn't try to minor in composition . 
thinks that he is going to be up until balls o ' clock making reeds and practicing a rather difficult etude ... 
| Oh god the lawn equipment outside of my dorm is making octave-half-step dissonance . Ugh my ears are in pain ... 
wishes < PROPMALE > would stop being so goddamn useless and actually provide me with edible food to nom . 
has no idea how he's going to get everything done that he needs to . Like practicing more before my lesson/studio and studying for my Psych exam . And I still has hunger :'( 
is off to a Psychology research study and then his exam ( which he will do amazing on ) . Practicing later maybe ? 
| If only stupid people would GTFO life would be pretty decent . 
should really make some time to troll around on 4chan this evening . 
is sending a strongly-worded complaint to KSU Dining Services about how hard they suck . 
| Band banquet . I am overcome with joy . 
' s name is spelled wrong on the MGF concert program . Just like every concert I've ever played in . GODDAMMIT . 
loves how stupid people think that the Legend of < PROPFEMALE > series invented the ocarina . Bahhh gtfokthxbai . 
won't end up getting a trumpet for christmas ; his parents neglected to answer their phones the dozen times I've called since 8:30 this morning and now it's back-ordered . THIS IS WHY I CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS . 
only has 3 and a half hours of class to endure before he goes home !... for a day . Damn you marching band !!! 
is not looking forward to the three-ish hour drive back to Toledo , especially on such a little amount of sleep ... 
is back at < PROPMALE > ! ( too soon , might I add ) and since the building is quiet I just might be able to practice without bitching . 
| Ugh marching banddddd :'( 
| Wind chill of 26 . That was probably the most unpleasant marching experience ever . 
needs to find some things to add to his list for christmas . Ideas ? 
thinks it's annoying that there isn't one eating place on-campus that's open ( that I'm aware of ) . So all the people who are stuck here without a car starve . M'kay . 
should be making reeds and writing a paper but we all know how that works =/ 
| Ughhhh so much work to do todayyyyy :'( Anyone know what the assignment was for FYE ? 
loves writing English papers of 3.5 parts ( which is what it says on the syllabus ) where each part has nothing remotely to do with the other . This blows . 
just drank Nyquil out of a shot glass . This is going to be a great night's sleep =) 
| Hurry someone tell me stuff to order on Amazon ! It's free ( and good ) shipping day ! 
wishes he wasn't so f**king sick all the time . Thank you Nyquil for giving me the will to live . 
is feeling much better ! Woooooo =) 
| If only the undesirables could be disposed of with mind bullets .

Is off to MSP to practice . Wahhhh . 
| Colloquium at 11 . Student recital series at 12 . Oboe lesson at 1 . Music theory study group at 2 . Concert Band at 3:45 . General Psych at 7 . Practicing afterward . Busy dayyy . 
| Sore throat + Ovaltine + delicious Asian noodles + ' Quil = happy . 
played his piece rather badly during studio . Oh well . I guess that means I still have a ton of practicing to do before juries . 
is going to attempt to spend the night cleaning , making reeds , and watching Cops , same as every other Friday =) 
| I always find it irritating that the things we try to remember most fade from memory whilst the bad memories last forever . 
| I haven't eaten anything today . Haaaaaaaaa I should probably go and get some noms . 
| No Adobe reader , no matter how many times you ask I don't want to install your f**king updates . Leave me alone .

| Thank you 4chan , for making anything possible . 
got an \A\ " in Honors Colloquium ! Woooo " 
needs to split & gouge tons of cane before he goes home next week . Yay more bleeding hands . 
| Ugh two classes left and I'm soooooo tired - and I still need to gouge and whittle tonight . Shoot me now .

would like a contrafagotte for christmas , please . 
still needs to find someone who would be willing to room with him in Beall next year ... 
just figured out why no one has made a marching band arrangement for \Tarkus\ " yet . IT'S IN 5/4 AND 7/8 TIME . GODDAMMIT . " 
| Wahhh I'm sooo hungry but I have to go make reeds and practice =( 
| I'm tired of making reeds and practicing . I'm tired of being sick . I'm tired of making reeds and practicing while I'm sick . Winter break can't come soon enough . 
| It's < PROPFEMALE > . There's a blizzard outside . There is a 3 degree wind chill with 30 mph gusts . No matter which direction you walk , the wind is in your face . Welcome to < PROPMALE > , y'all . 
was at Wal-Mart with < PROPFEMALE > B and we were fighting about the pluralization of the stores \Kroger\ " and \ " Aldi\ " . Some guy asked us if we were getting married . People never cease to amaze me . Awkwardddd . " 
| Study study study ... 
' s new < PROPMALE > case came in the mail ! I am quite happy now =) 
had tons of fun playing Melee . It was probably the high fructose corn syrup in the blue drank that was making me slap-happy =) 
| I wish SNL would get cancelled already so NBC can put something funny in . Seriously guys - the good ideas ran out a longgg time ago . 
| IT'S DECEMBER ! WHY IS IT RAINING ? 
is going to spend his afternoon making reeds and practicing for the Theory practical that he will fail with flying colours . 
prays to the reed-god that the four measures in the Poulenc I can't play will stop being difficult . 
did so much better on his practical than he thought he would , despite a few mistakes . Now I have to study and play Pokemon for the rest of the day . 
| Jury tonight . May the reed-god help me in my time of need . 
| Well I still can't play the Poulenc sonata . The weather ruined both of my reeds . I'm tired as hell . Jury in 3 and a half hours . I wish I cared . I just want to go homeeeee . 
got an A on his jury ! Now I have to motivate myself to study for < PROPMALE>' exam . Meh .

| And now for something completely different : bedddd . 
| Oh god . So bored . Please kill me . 
| Does anyone in Toledo want to go see Avatar/New < PROPFEMALE > at some point before x-mas ? I'm quite bored and I have movie passes to use up before the cinema is bought out . 
| WHY DOES TOLEDO SUCK SO HARD ??? 
wishes he would've brought his TV back from < PROPMALE > ; the 9\ he has in his room is hardly capable of playing Twilight < PROPFEMALE > or Brawl =( " 
| Semester GPA : 3.842 ! 
' s brother gave up on his clarinet 10 minutes after starting , and now I have to endure his horrible guitar playing ; he has absolutely no musical skill so he tunes every string flatter than the next . Dear god . 
| I don't understand the point of christmas . People buy you crap you don't need while avoiding things you actually want . Here's a thought : write me a check and let me buy my own presents . 
| Well my parents stopped being mad ( for the most part ) and I got most of what I wanted for christmas . Yay . 
is off to his Aunt's for moar presents . 
is perhaps seeing New < PROPFEMALE > sometime today ? 
| Am I the only person who does not want an Ipod Touch ? 
just finished watching X-men origins , and it was pretty good . Next is Bolt =) 
| Why the hell am I still awake ? Goddammit . 
is tired as balls , but it's not like I have anything important to do for the next three f**king weeks . 
' s computer reparis are going to cost $350 dollars . But at least it will be able to run 10 year old games without sucking multiple sets of balls . 
Tron was a meh . I think the soundtrack ruined it for me ; I don't think I heard a single leading tone the entire movie . 
Per my parents ' advice , I'm taking it easy next semester and I'm going to take classes during the summer . Goodbye , useless online World Geography class ! 
Oops , we go back to school next Monday . I should prolly order my textbooks . And practice my oboe for the first time since before juries . Nahhhh 
finally got his computer back ! But all of his stuff is gone so he has a balls amount of rebuliding to do . 
| Ugh I'm so bored and still have a metric shit ton of cleaning to do before my room is decent . I don't feel like practicing or making reeds . What's new ? 
| I am starting to dislike waking up at Noon each day . I feel like I've wasted way too much time . What's new ? 
| I'm hungry , tired , and bored . It's the winter break trifecta . 
| So I definitely think I'm doing marching band next year . I might be out of my mind , but I actually enjoyed it much more than I thought I would . Now on to the part about what instrument I'll play ... 
| One and a half weeks left . Ughhh I want to go back to Kennnnt . 
| $350 on computer repairs and they didn't install the MTP drivers . I am quite the unhappy camper right now . 
| Today has the feeling of a horrible day waiting to happen . christmas \party\ " later with some relatives I don't know . OH JOY . " 
| For those < PROPMALE > students who don't have a clue ( like me ) , the residence halls open back up at 8:00 AM on January 17 and classes start the 19th . That is all . 
' s car won't start . Braden is angry because he has to drive his brother across town to his lesson in his mom's < PROPFIRST > . 
| Damn you winter break and your uncanny ability to keep people from doing anything productive ! 
| It irks me that the DVD sets of those cartoons we watched in the 90s have all been discontinued years before we are even old enough to buy them - and that's what Rapidshare is for =) 
is using his mind powers to create misfortune for people he doesn't even know . Welcome to my world ? =) 
| AMERICAN IDOL IS ON TONIGHT !!! 
| Instead of going to bed several hours ago like I was planning , I watched stupid people play GTA and Left for Dead on Youtube . Ughhh my brain . 
| Majora's Mask , Goldeneye , < PROPFEMALE > Fox 64 , Super Metroid , and Phantasy < PROPFEMALE > IV are all on the Wii ?! BRING ME MY CREDIT CARD . 
| Well since everyone is screaming at eachother I can only pack my things and look forward to my departure from this godforsaken place . 
| The Concert/Symphonic Band concert is the day after my birthday . Goddammit . 
| < PROPMALE > Barker should stop being old and go back to the Price is Right . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > just isn't good at it . 
will be spending the evening wandering aimlessly around Second Life since there's nothing productive/interesting he feels like doing . 
| < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is gay ? Holy crap . Not only did this shock me but typing this status was one hell of a < PROPFEMALE > vu , so I'm thouroughly creeped out . 
is going out to buy stuff that he needs for his dorm room . 
still hasn't seen New < PROPFEMALE > . I am dissapoint . 
is back in < PROPMALE > ! Yayyyyy . 
is trying to figure out when the chair auditions for Concert band are ; if they are tomorrow , I have to make reeds and practice today . If they're Thursday , I go back to bed . 
| People who use \ ' s \ " to pluralize something should be burnt at the stake . Stop being dumb . " 
| I have to decide between Biggest Loser and American Idol tonight . Crap . 
| Does anyone know if there is supposed to be a high F6 on trumpet at the end of < PROPFIRST > Dragon's version of < PROPFEMALE > the Beautiful ? I've only found one recording that has it out of many that I've heard . 
| It's amazing how little I have to do now that marching band's over . So why am I going to be doing it again next year ? 
| I would pick the Education in a Democratic Society class that has a balls amount of work . Damn . 
| Attention Music of Non-Western Cultures people ! Lecture notes from our book can be downloaded from a podcast on iTunes U . Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Hoelzle for figuring this out . Most of the audio examples are online also . 
| After playing Magic the Gathering for almost 4 hours with < PROPFEMALE > Legge and < PROPFEMALE > B I'm very tired and ready for bed . 
| After a three hour nap I'm ready to do absolutely nothing tonight . 
has a ton of work to do today . Probably going to the Chamber concert and the All-Star Band concert later . 
has to write several papers in the APA format . Thank you Ohio public school education for not teaching me how to use it . 
has decided not to go to the All < PROPFEMALE > Band Concert , since the amount of homework he has is proving to be overwhelming . 
| Wahh I can't let myself go to sleep until I get this paper out of my hair . Moar homework tomorrow and practicing/whittling against my will . 
| Well on my parents ' anniversary ( today ) some kids from down the street came and threw ice balls at our house , wrecking the siding and breaking the door , and a police report was filed . I don't understand how my upper-middle class street suddenly became a white-trash bonanza . 
| I've been reading a small-print book since 1:00 today and I've knocked out a good two-hundred pages . On to < PROPMALE > making sometime tonight ? 
still finds it unbelievable how people can take football so seriously . 
read 550+ pages in a novel with rather small print in under 35 hours . I'm quite happy with myself right now , being a month ahead in Colloquium now . 
| I'm feeling the urge to be unnecessarily productive today ... 
| I'm feeling really burnt out from the amount of work I've had to do the past few days . I don't know if I'm going to practice for my lesson or not . 
| Annoyingly , my voice has gotten lower so I can get down to an Eb2 now . But I lost the top half-octave of my tenor range so I can hardly sing anything . 
| I have three levels of MacGamut to do for tomorrow . I could either spend 4 hours getting a 0 , or no hours getting a 0 . I might as well try for a few minutes , but I have no hope I'll even get to level 5 . Back to my books . 
| Somehow I managed to finish MacGamut . I don't know how , and I don't care . I'm just quite happy . 
| Ugh this cold is not the best for my oboe - I don't want to haul it to MSP for Studio ... 
| And so the roommate hunt begins . Sigh . 
| I don't understand why stupid people keep making groups asking for people's < PROPFIRST > . There IS a Facebook phonebook ' ya know ... 
is on an Amazon shopping spree . It's like the Wal-Mart of the interwebs . 
wishes that lewdly-dressed women would stop asking him to play Evony ; it takes more than that to get me to click on random ads ;D 
is going to the mall with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez to get some necessary shopping done . 
| As a result of this afternoon's trip I am now the proud owner of The Lion < PROPMALE > DVD and a < PROPFIRST > Lautner poster . Fantastic =) 
' s computer won't play The Lion < PROPMALE > because apparently the copy-protection technology from 2002 keeps the DVD from playing in computers from 8 years from then . Thank you Windows for destroying my childhood . I don't have a DVD player . 
| I have underestimated the time required for all of my homework . Crap . 
| This is one of those nights when scheduling to get my wisdom teeth removed just so I can get vicodin afterwards seems like a reasonable idea . 
| I just woke up yet I already feel ready for a nap . Time to get that housing application out of the way ... 
| It's International Hug a Gay Day tomorrow ? Why the hell not . 
| My disgust and irriation knows no bounds . 
| Boring day . Symphonic/Concert Band later , then maybe going to the gym for the first time this year . 
| When life gives you lemons , f**k it with a d**k . Then play Pokemon . Or Magic . 
| I did nottt practice enough for my lesson tomorrow . Oh well ; there's always next week . 
was up too late reading . My lesson this morning is going to destroy me . 
had a reallyyyy bad oboe lesson . I guess I should maybe practice moar ? 
| I'm going to bed . Yes I know it's not even 8 yet . 
| I quite dislike waking up and not being able to fall back asleep ... 
| Later , I'm going to beat Metroid Prime in one sitting . Goal : 5 1/2 hours . 
wasted the entire afternoon sleeping , and is now going to get his car and go to the Rec for hell knows how long . 
is not going to the Rec tonight because of the goddamm blizzard outside . Might be going tomorrow before seeing New < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez , < PROPFEMALE > B , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
| SNOW RUINS EVERYTHING ! 
| New < PROPFEMALE > was only slightly less-terrible than Twilight . The acting hasn't gotten much better . It definitely could have used more of < PROPFIRST > Lautner and less of the whiney bitch . 
| Nothing sets the stage for a week's worth of failure more than a D on an ear-training quiz . Dammit I wish it was next year already . 
| Not gonna lie , the new Facebook layout is pretty nice . Also , no one else send me invites for the pickle-related Twilight group . I will not join =) 
actually injured himself practicing =( but since , for some odd reason , I have to know my jury piece by Thursday I have to practice like mad until then . 
| According to the radar , we should be getting 2+ of inches of snow starting 30 minutes ago . I am dissapoint . 
| CLASSES CANCELED AFTER 4 ! YESSSSSS . 
just received the New < PROPFEMALE > soundtrack in the mail <3 ( and just to clarify - I'm referring to the score , not the crappy stuff ) . 
| Concert Band makes me want to scream . 
is easily amused by his earphone's ability to pick up on normally-inaudible parts in music . 
| Happy International < PROPMALE > Day ! 
has a ton of homework to do and errands to run ... 
| Another boring Saturday evening . Blah . 
is having adventures in Narnia . 
| Happy Singles Awareness Day ! 
| Ow wisdom teeth are impacting 3-( 
| CAPS LOCK ! SCHOOL CANCELLATIONS GOOOO ! 
| I'm not walking through this crap to go to Theory . Back to bed . 
had a nightmare that I put a crack in the top joint of my oboe . I might wrap it in a blanket before I go to Concert Band just to be safe ... 
is watching mens ' figure skating whilst making reeds and not studying for the Non-Western cultures exam . Quite an uneventful evening . 
got raped and pillaged by the Music of Non-Western Cultures exam . Uh oh . 
will have to practice tonight instead of watching American Idol . I am not a happy camper . 
| Theory exam , practicing , studio at 12 , and then nothing for the rest of the day . Tons of work to do for next week . 
will be heading to Chapel Hill this afternoon to spend lots and lots of money . Huzzah . 
has lots of homework I should be doing today . I'm also out of [ non-pithy ] cane so I'm heading to MSP later to gouge and practice the Ferling . 
| Without coffee-flavored energy drinks my life would quickly grind to a halt . Time for reed-making . 
| Forget about what I said about last week being bad . I have an unnecessary amount of work to do for this week an next ; my 5 < PROPFEMALE > paper I still haven't written , an entire book to read , another paper , yet another paper , 4+ etudes , and a midterm Theory Practical I haven't started working on yet . FML . 
| I should stop procrastinating and start the unnecessary amount of homework I have , but listening to the two new CDs I got in the mail today is much more interesting . Stupid Colloquium paper . 
| Keyboard lab for 20 minutes then nothing until Symphonic/Concert Band at 3:20 . Time to get shit done . 
| Outline for my paper is done , now I just have to type the stupid thing . If I can get that done and finish my three reeds tonight all is well . AMERICAN IDOL'S ON ! 
| Tireddd . So much workkk . If I can make it to Spring Break everything will be peachy . 
| < PROPMALE > State has built their campus expansion on Second Life for everyone to see ? o.O I'm off ! 
| As much as I like < PROPFEMALE > , I cannot understand why she's a judge on American Idol . She doesn't really have a musical background so all she can do is shake her head and say people sound good . 
| What would be the point of writing a paper for an honors class if all the verb tenses didn't agree ? I'm still getting an A . I only wish I would've finished the damned thing last week so I could've practiced more for my lesson . 
is really tired . I can't wait until Concert Band is over so I can sleeeeeep . 
| I may be incredibly tired , but today has been pretty good . One of my christmas presents just arrived ( which was on backorder ) , my new shoes came in , and I got my refund check from the Bursar's office . Now all that's left to do is clean my room and practice La Mer . 
| WHY THE HELL DO WE HAVE CLASS ? 
| The Honors College students got to vote on what type of tree they would like planted at some random place near the building . On the list were exotic trees from Japan and Korea . What won ? A Red < PROPFEMALE > . A tree native to Ohio . Little things like this reallyyy irritate me . 
| Practice , whittle , practice . 
| Dear Kent : STOP SNOWING . 
kindly thanks the visitors to the basketball game who filled up the lot behind Bowman instead of the designated lot next to < PROPFIRST > Ritchie . I had to park way the hell away from my dorm . 
| Faculty Ensemble Concert at 3 ! Tons of homework the rest of the night . 
| This is going to be an incredibly long week . Hopefully I'll find enough time to practice as much as I need to for my lesson on Thursday and Theory practical on Friday . 
| Dammit , < PROPMALE > Dem ! You ruin nearly every < PROPMALE > I have to practice with your unreasonable work load . 
| Next fall is going to be fun . I already have my schedule made up for the most part , and I have unavoidable scheduling conflicts between things I need to take . Sigh . 
| I got my Colloquium paper back and my prof wants me to submit it for publication by the Honors College . Woot . I guess this makes up for the fact I have to read a 750 < PROPFEMALE > novel and prepare a presentation for it in 3 weeks time . 
| Disregard [ males ] , acquire currency . 
| I should be concerned that I'm not remotely prepared for my lesson , Studio , or my practical on Friday , but alas , since I have an unnecessary amount of work to do in the next three weeks , I don't care anymore . 
| WHY THE FUCK DID THE FIRE ALARM GO OFF AT 1:30 IN THE MORNING ??? Since there was no smoke , I assume it was a drill and I'll have to bitch at someone later . 
' s practical did not go bad at all ; I may have gotten as high as a B . Gouging cane after studio and then tons of work to do . Beall 616A next fall =) 
| 4:12 AM . 
needs to make reeds and knock out the first 400 pages in a novel for Colloquium . Busy , busy day . 
| Concert band/Symphonic Band concert at 3:30 . Birthday dinner with my parents ( against my will ) afterwards . 
| I think my mother is trying to turn me into the daughter she never had . She bought me a candle warmer and a Longaberger basket for my birthday . And lots of coffee . 
| I may be sick , but I GOT AN ' A ' ON MY PRACTICAL ! 
| I've got a splitting headache and that familiar feeling of a sinus infection starting . I really just want to rest but if I stop working I will never get everything done . I wish I had time for fun anymore =( 
| I'm too sick to go to keyboard lab this morning . Concert Band is not looking too good either . Unfortunately , like always , I have a never-ending workload . 
| Why are the RAs here so useless ? I package of mine was signed for at 1:48 yesterday afternoon . As of five minutes ago , I still do not have the ability to pick it up . There's a lot of nothing going on behind that desk and I'm losing my < PROPFEMALE > . 
is not going to have his lesson this morning . I woke up thinking I was better but it turns out I still feel like a festering pile of feces . 
has just learned that isopropyl alcohol does not substitute for hydrogen peroxide for sanitizing reeds . Ewwwwww . 
| It's such a nice day outside . < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez is coming over to play video games , and maybe we're going to the Rec ? 
| Going on a shopping trip to Chapel Hill with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez . 
| It's snowing =( 
| POKEMON HEART GOLD COMES OUT TODAY ! But Amazon sucks so I won't get it until Wednesday . I'm still completely capable of not doing my homework by playing Starfox Adventures . 
| The best part about having a class in a computer lab is being able to Facebook . After < PROPMALE > Dem I'm going to the MGF meeting and then back to my dorm to not do homework . 
| Keyboard lab for 20 minutes , then I'm back to bed for a few more hours . Meeing with my Colloquium group later ; Concert band ; obsessively playing Pokemon . 
| Pokemon Heart Gold . I'm pathetically happy right now =) 
| < PROPMALE > Dem meeting at the < PROPMALE > Board of < PROPMALE > ucation . Afterwards I'll prolly sleep since I'm too tired to do anything productive . I'm still sick and don't feel like practicing either . Ugh oh what to do ... 
| Do a barrel roll . 
| 6 and a half hours of sleep . I don't know yet how I'm going to make it through today . < PROPMALE > Orch concert tonight =) 
| < PROPMALE > Orchestra concert at 8 . Playing games all night afterward ... 
is actually bored right now . Homework time . 
| Damn poor people outside blasting their ghetto music on loudspeakers . It's kinda hard to get crap done with the racket . 
doesn't have too much work to do today . Theory and reed-making , and then studying for the Non-Western Cultures exam I forgot about until just now . 
| Oh look - the cable goes out 10 minutes before the only < PROPMALE > Potter movie I haven't seen starts . FML . 
| Holy hell the cable is still not fixed and I'm now missing the Amazing Race . One of two days during the week that I watch TV and < PROPMALE > somehow finds a way to ruin it . Sigh . 
| I despise Monday with every fiber of my being and I hope they go away forever . That is all . 
| There has literally been a disturbance in the force and it's driving me bat-shit . 
| It looks like I won't be able to have fun during Spring Break ; I have 4 projects due shortly after . 
| The brownie fairies are making their rounds again . Do want . 
| No class for the rest of the day and my to-do list is fairly short . 2 reeds to make , practicing a little bit , and writing my letter for band . 
| One and a half days till Spring Break . It has never been so hard to do so little work . 
| Not much to do tonight . If it stops raining I'm going back to MSP to practice w/e excerpt for studio . I still have some packing to do before I leave tomorrow ... 
| I've only been home a few hours and yet I already want to go back to < PROPMALE > . This is not going to be a fun break ... 
| Going to see Avatar with the fam later and obsessively watching Discovery Health and playing Pokemon the rest of the night . 
suddenly likes classical music way more than he used to . 
just Googled himself and found his long-lost Twitter account . Last post : over a year ago . Time to fail . 
| A wonderful evening accompanied by various works of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>' . The theme to ' Jurassic Park ' is epic . 
is waiting anxiously for the soundtrack to Avatar that's going to be delivered this afternoon . 
| What an absolutely boring Tewsdey . Luckily I have plenty of new music to listen to . 
| I'm rearranging the furniture in my room , a sure sign that I am indeed procrastinating . 
| Why do most movies now have such crappy scores ? Bleh . 
is strongly considering double majoring . I really want to but it would cost a lot more money and it'd take 6 years for me to graduate . 
is really freaking out . I have so much work to do before I go back and I also have to re-clean the house for Easter . I don't know how I'm going to have time to do it all . 
is finally done with the first two phrases of the part-writing project . Now on to other homeworks . 
is going to see Clash of the Titans tonight with the fam . It has a mediocre score , so therefore the movie must be mediocre . 
| So according to the computer repair shop all of the data on my old hard drive is lost . This includes my Theory project , several half-started projects , and over 80 GB of music . I'm going to freak out . 
got his computer back and now has a crap ton of programs to install , music to import , and projects to redo . Dammit . 
is going back to < PROPMALE > later this afternoon . Lots of work to do for the next few weeks . 
| A three hour drive on less than 6 hours of sleep ? This is going to be fun . Off to < PROPMALE > ! 
Is back in < PROPMALE > . I don't know if I feel like doing work tonight . 
| Reed-making , Colloquium paper/poster , bleh . 
has both large-ish assignments that are due on Thursday done , so now I can focus on making reeds and other projects . Next up : Travel report . 
Thinks that today is going to be a little slow . It feels like Monday . 
| Finishing a really dumb colloquium paper , making reeds , and lots of busy work for < PROPMALE > Dem tonight . My lesson tomorrow is going to suckkkk . 
' s Colloquium paper is shitty shitty shitty . 
| Soooo tired . I don't know how I'm going to make it through the day . 
just got back from a master class in Pittsburg . < PROPFEMALE > McGreevey , < PROPFEMALE > Sajewski and I got really lost downtown and without my dad it would have taken us forever to figure out where the hell we were going . 
| Non-Western Cultures , Studio , and an advising appointment . I better get caught up on my sleep tonight since the entire weekend will be spent doing homework . 
is quite confident that his honors college advising meeting today is going to be as equally unproductive as the last one . Why can't they realize that we do a better job ourselves ? 
| Blah blah tons of work to do . Maybe going to see How To Train Your Dragon with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez later . 
is back from the movies with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez . I think I'm going to play Sonic until I go to bed , and then getting up on-time to do lots of work . 
| I hate Mondays . I also hate getting songs from the 2nd Lion < PROPMALE > stuck in my head . This is going to be a longggg day . 
| SHIT Glee is on tomorrow and I'm several episodes behind ! Dammit . 
| I haven't started my Travel Report for Non-Western and I need to finish it tonight since I won't have time tomorrow . Wahhhhhh I don't want to do work anymore . 
| Dear Kent : thank you for waking me up at 7 in the morning with heavy machinery . 
is writing his Travel Report for Non-Western . I'm having a difficult time writing out an < PROPFEMALE > accent . This is going to be epic . 
| GLEEEEEEEEE IS ONNNNNNNNN 
| Words can hardly describe how much I hate Education in a Democratic Society . I can't wait till this semester is over . 
is haphazardly throwing together the second part of his part writing project . Hopefully I'll be able to go to bed way earlier than yesterday . Lesson and Colloquium cancelled tomorrow ! 
| The 5th generation Pokemon games are going to be called Pokemon Black and White . I'm glad Nintendo's not even trying to hide the fact they're out of ideas . 
did not anticipate staying up late again for no reason . I guess that's what college is for . 
| Blahhhhh Music of Non Western Cultures then studio . < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez is coming over laterrrrr . 
wants a pet Zoroark . 
| < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez is coming over to play Sonic , and after a recital we're going to Wal Mart to return Chinese-made garbage . 
is playing Rock Band at < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez's place . I'm failing at drums =) 
is quite fed up . 
| Nyquil + knives = I don't think I'm going to try to make more reeds tonight . 
is getting quite adept at whipping working reeds out in 20 minutes or less . 
wants a DQ Blizzard . 
| Blarg Keyboard Lab , Colloquium , and Concert Band . I have wayyyy too much work to do for < PROPMALE > Dem in the next week . 
is heading off to the library for the second time this entire year . I hope I don't get lost somewhere in the 12 floors of bull crap . 
| Looks like I'm going to be skipping Glee tonight to read \One Size Fits Few\ " and make reeds . Oh how I love college . " 
| YOU THINK THAT'S HARD ? I'M PASSING A GALL STONE AS WE SPEAK ! THAT'S HARD ! - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
| ONE THIRD OF WOMAN WILL BE RAPED IN HER LIFETIME ! 
| Last ear training quiz of the year ! ( I failed as usual ) . Studio is going to suck , then I have to somehow motivate myself to split 1/8 of a pound of cane . 
| Dear credit card bill : SCREW YOU . 
is going to some band thing , then splitting cane , writing a few papers , and other stuff I don't want to do . 
is having a lovely evening cleaning , watching Cops , and playing video games . 
is at < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez's place playing Kingdom Hearts , Rock Band , and other stuff . 
| Yayyy it's raining and I'm actually inside this time ! 
| There's never enough time in the day to do everything that needs to be done . 
is gonna have a hard time getting through this week . 
is actually sad that the school year is coming to a close . That means I have to move back home ='( 
| So someone tell me again why I'm doing marching band next year ? I could get soooo many classes out of the way w/o it . 
almost got t-boned by a parta bus . fail . 
| Theory project practice then performance , Music of Nonwestern Cultures , and Studio . As far as I know , I'm not doing anything productive in any class ; definition of a great day . 
had a rather poor performance in Theory today . Thank you weather for ruining my reeds . 
is hopefully going to have a productive day . But everyone knows how that always works out =\\ 
went to Gamestop and bought a copy of Starfox Assault . Looks like I can waste the day after all ! 
thinks that stereotypes are okay , as long as they are true . 
is watching the documentary \Jesus Camp\ " and is sufficiently shocked and appalled . " 
reallyyyyy needs to get shit done today , including reeds , practicing , a powerpoint , and at least one paper . 
needs a job and no one in Toledo is hiring . Dammit . 
got a 99% on his part-writing project ! 
| This is not going to be a good week . Third week in a row I've cracked two new reeds . < PROPMALE > Dem presentation in an hour my group is unprepared for . Stomach flu . Three papers to write . FML . 
' s < PROPMALE > Dem presentation went badly . One member of the group did not do what they were supposed to do and plagiarized the group activity . Also , they didn't turn in required materials because those are not done either . I hope I don't get in trouble because of my group members ' idiocy . 
| Someone called me and asked if I wanted to be the clarinet instructor for some high school's band camp AND get paid for it . Yessssssssss . 
is furiously typing away at his < PROPMALE > Dem papers which are due in less than an hour . SHIT why did I procrastinate earlier with Facebook and Metroid ? 
| Theory exam , lesson , concert band , concert . Long ish day and I'm not prepared for any of it . 
| University Band and Concert Band concert tonight at 7:30 in Cartwright Hall . COME . 
is not sure what to do . If I end up taking this clarinet teaching job I won't be able to be section leader next year . Opinions ? ( from people who are NOT interested in taking my place ) . 
| Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends , we're so glad you could attend ; come inside , come inside . 
is off to the oboe studio barbecue ! 
may be choosing his teaching job over marching band . 
| Some guy swooped in and took the parking spot I had been patiently waiting for . So , I honked , swore , and gave him the finger multiple times ; I should live in New York . 
is actually not too worried about his practical . Tonight I'm going to be practicing my scales , keyboard sheet , and prepared melodies . Fun fun fun . FOUR MORE DAYS ! 
| Jury tonight at 8:30 . I'm going to be practicing for that and preparing for my practical all day . Booooooooo 
is praying to the reed-god for a successful jury . 
| I got an A on my jury ! Woohoo . Now I can dread getting sodomized by my theory practical in the morning . 
did not fail his practical ! I almost crapped my pants when I saw the second sight singing . Luckily that's not the one I had to do . 
is spending the rest of the day playing Roller Coaster Tycoon and writing a Colloquium paper due tomorrow morning . 
needs a name for his oboe . 
is finishing up his Colloquium paper , then is going to gouge cane this afternoon . I don't have any exams left , but of course my < PROPMALE > Dem prof is finding a way to waste our time by making us show up for class tomorrow . 
went to the studio to gouge cane . But then I didn't because I didn't want to make a mess . Looks like I won't be making a lot of reeds this summer . 
| Last night in < PROPMALE > =( 
| It will be a freaking miracle if all of my stuff fits in my SUV . Back in Sylvania by 9 tonight =( 
is on his way back to Sylvania !!! 
| I literally can't move back in because my family of pack rats have made the house a disaster . I'm hungry but there's no food . I already want to move back to < PROPMALE > . Can it be fall already ? 
is very slowly cleaning his room ( and the house ) . 
got a $5.00 tax refund . SCREW YOU GOVERNMENT . 
is waiting anxiously for his final grades . 
is playing Pokemon . Lots and lots of Pokemon . 
' s unproductive summer is off to a great start . 
has played Heart Gold for 20 hours in the past three days ; that's how pathetic my life is right now =\\ 
is wondering if it always takes this long for final grades to be posted . 
| Pokemon has become too complicated . There is a 1 in 1500 < PROPMALE > I will find the perfect Oddish . 
| You know you're an honors student when you get a 3.84 GPA and you're disappointed . 
| Bored . Northview's band concert is tonight OUTSIDE and I have to go . Booooo . 
would like a touch-sensitive keyboard . It's just too hard to learn how to play when every note sounds exactly the same . 
is tearing the internet apart for a recording of the score for the Beauty and the Beast musical . 
is already fed up with his family and there is still 2 months of summer left . 
| TAKE THAT LIPITOR ! I'M BACON ! 
is crazy tired . This is going to be yet another unproductive evening . 
| My sleep schedule is all messed up =( I would care more if I wasn't unemployed . 
just went to the library and discovered that they make you check your own stuff out now . Very disappointing . Thank you city of Sylvania budget cuts ! 
is pretty bored . I have yet to finish cleaning my room and I still haven't practiced at all this summer . I'm supposed to memorize all of the Barret Articulation studies . HAH . 
| Blahhhhhh summer . Another day watching court cases , medical shows , and not practicing . I really need to order some sheet music so I can actually start to be productive . ( And get a job ) . 
just taught his dad how to use facebook . 
just installed an extension which filters out everything on the internet that has to do with < PROPFIRST > Bieber . Win . 
is going out to some Mexican restaurant for his mother's birthday dinner . 
is watching old episodes of Pokemon because I'm just awesome like that . 
is perplexed by a dream he had this morning . 
has just discovered how to use chat roulette to \ 
ruin people's childhoods . Tomorrow I'll give it a shot =) 
| Dear Kent , \ 
Thank you for the 3.5% tuition increase , \ 
the new $100 per semester fee for students in the College of the Arts for maintenance , \ 
< PROPFIRST > Lefton's raise and a $ 90,000 bonus last year . \ 
Why did I go to such an awful school ? 
| One of the greatest parts of summer is not knowing what day of the week it is . 
really needs to get his wisdom teeth out ; my mouth is really starting to hurt . 
finally got his sheet music in , and as soon as Monday rolls around I'll start learning the Mozart Concerto . 
| Damn tornado sirens ruining a perfectly mundane evening . 
| It's amazing how slow summer goes when you don't have a job . I NEED A JOB . 
strongly dislikes the Mozart oboe concerto , a reflection of his general dislike of anything Mozart composed . It's way too boring . 
is getting back into Sim City 4 , a game that came out in 2003 and yet requires unbelievable amounts of mods just to make it playable . 
can't decide what to make of the music video to < PROPMALE > . 
needs opinions from people . How much work is involved with Music Teaching as a Profession and Educational Psychology ? I might try to pull off 22 or 23 credit hours with marching band . 
gets his wisdom teeth out next Tuesday . Hopefully it won't keep me from practicing for more than a few days . 
fixed his umbrella with < PROPMALE > thread and nail polish . I'm either very practical , cheap , or a total failure . 
| I'm getting my wisdom teeth out in the morning . Everything should go smoothly and I'll have plenty of vicoden when it's over . 
| The worst part about getting one's wisdom teeth out is not the actual surgery , it's dealing with the pain and blood afterward . 
is playing < PROPFEMALE > Fox 64 for the first time and I\m doing lots of barrel rolls . If I like it enough I'll buy in on Virtual Console later . " 
| Epic block/street garage sale tomorrow and Friday . My profits going directly to the < PROPMALE > supply and video game fund . 
is wasting away his summer waiting for his mouth to heal . 
had another productive gaming day , if there is ever such a thing . 
| Damn wisdom teeth , I WANNA PRACTICE SO BADDDDDDD . 
| Boring day ; I'm cleaning my room and playing old video games later . I might be getting my new TV in the next few days . 
played Majora's Mask for 9 and a quarter hours today . I really should get a life , but I suppose the purpose of summer is to waste extraordinary amounts of free time =) 
is running low on happy pills . 
| Dad's bitching about a $400+ electric < PROPMALE > ; turns out air conditioning is expensive . 
is taking baby steps before playing the oboe again . I just played a few < PROPFEMALE > songs on my ocarina but I'm disappointed I cannot figure out how to circular breathe . 
| The fact that < PROPMALE > Shore composed the score for Eclipse does not mean the movie is going to be any less terrible , I just thought I'd throw that out there . 
| < PROPMALE > State is starting a muggle Quidditch team ? I'm in . 
is about to beat Super Metroid for the first time and is missing a missile expansion that would get 100% completion - I have no idea where the hell it is . I'm so dejected =\\ 
| My new TV is coming today ! Starfox 64 is going to look pretty damn good =) 
is looking at $450 in textbooks for the fall semester , commence with the slitting of my wrists . 
is trying to force himself to make reeds , but in the end the video games will win . 
loves thunderstorms =) 
is anxiously waiting for his marching band music to arrive in the mail , I don't want to wait until the last minute to start practicing like last year . 
would like to go one day without embarrassing himself in some way . 
is pretty bad at Sim City 4 , or really anything that has the word \sim\ " in it's title . " 
is trying not to get addicted to Ebay . 
is playing Metroid while watching court cases . Life could not be better at this particular moment . 
just ate Taco < PROPFEMALE > for the first time in almost a year\ 
? __ ? I'm feeling a little sick right now ... 
just got his Wii Classic controller from Ebay , I'm a little miffed because the seller didn't send everything they were supposed to . 
is a Shinesparking ninja . 
| Marching band music is not being mailed until next week =( 
| Oh , okay . Ke$ha is like an auto-tuned , less-talented version of Gaga , and Gaga is a [ brilliant ] knock-off of < PROPFEMALE > . By the transitive property of equality , Ke$ha just sucks . 
| Oh my , Westboro picketed Comic-con . Now I've seen everything . 
| DreamWorks is going to make a live show for How To Train Your Dragon ? YESSSS . So pumped ! 
| I must say , I'm actually sort of looking forward to marching band this year , everything's gonna be better . 
| Volunteering from 5 until 11 , I am very unhappy about having to empty garbage cans and < PROPFEMALE > kegs for 6 hours . 
| Back from a long evening , I'm too tired to do anything productive for the next few hours , besides stalking people online . 
| Like a good neighbor , State Farm is there - with < PROPFIRST > Lautner , a rope , and a taser gun . 
| Ew , looks like a good portion of the clarinets have problems with their music ; pre-camp is going to be hectic after all . 
| Got my music , woohoo , no problems . 
dislikes waking up to the sound of a tornado siren and then having to take refuge in his basement like it's a bomb shelter when the only cloud rotation is 20 < PROPMALE > to the south . Ah , over reacting parents . 
is unsuccessfully practicing infinite bomb jumps and murder beam glitches in Super Metroid . Just the fact I'm practicing a video game = total fail . 
| Thunderstorm outside , countless hours playing Metroid Fusion , this is a pretty damn good Saturday . 
is already packing his stuff for the fall . Summer BEGONE ! 
is anxiously waiting for his package from WWBW to arrive , I can't do much with my marching band music until I get my new mouthpiece =| 
is starting to get frantic ; it should not take the USPS 6+ days to ship a first-class package from southern Indiana to Toledo . I hope I'll have a mouthpiece and reeds to use for pre-camp . 
Not to be stereotypical , but I love Bed Bath & Beyond . Hopefully my clarinet stuff will be in the mail by the time I come back . 
| No wonder why the clarinet reeds I bought are so cheap , they require tremendous amounts of scraping just to make them playable . 
is leaving for pre-camp pretty soon , I'm looking forward to the weekend but I still hate driving three hours to get to < PROPMALE > . 
Is poorly rested but is ready to get shit done today . 
| Pre camp is better today , I'm hoping and praying that it will rain so we won't have to spend very much time outside . 
does not understand why he chooses to eat bananas even though he is allergic to them . 
| Do any of the music majors at < PROPMALE > who took percussion methods know if we actually use the textbook ? 
| 96 video game soundtracks on my computer , let's see if I can break 100 by the end of today , it's not like I have anything better to do . 
has In the Stone and the EWF Opener memorized , tomorrow I may move on to the Closer . This is going to be an easy year for me testing-wise now that I know to get everything done before the season starts . 
really screwed up his back , I may be going to the doctors in the morning for meds if my vidodin doesn't work . 
is trying to find a good record store in Toledo that doesn't involve a trip into the ghetto . 
just found out he pinched a nerve in his neck/back , and the only thing I can do is wait for it to get better with the help of my good ' ol friend , codeine . 
| Turns out my body can't handle codeine , so I may drive to the ER if my stomach doesn't stop freaking out . 
dislikes that his parents left on a trip and didn't leave much food in the house ; it looks like I shall be surviving on grilled cheese and bran until I can make it to the store tomorrow . 
| Moving to < PROPMALE > in 9 days ! 
| $360 in textbooks and I still have reed-making supplies to order . Epic sigh . 
finally finished his pointless arrangment of the Bowser's World theme from Super < PROPFIRST > 64 , now I can move on to bigger and better things . 
would like to go a week without having someone from < PROPFEMALE > or one of the terrorist countries try to hijack my computer . It shouldn't be this difficult to download things semi-legally . 
| Parents are on their way back from Niagra Falls ; it was nice to have them out of the house for 5 days but I'm looking forward to a nice home-cooked meal . 
wasted his summer , I hardly practiced and I feel completely unprepared for the start of the semester . Oh well , it'll be just like last year =| 
| 6 days ! 
O.o today is Friday the 13th , that must explain why my computer is completely not working . 
is packing , come Wednesday morning I'm gonna book it the hell out of Sylvania . 
| Family reunion today and tomorrow . Ughhhh 
ran out of things to do , so is wasting time on Second Life . 
can't wait until Wednesday . I'm mostly packed but I have a few more things to do before band camp starts . 
| The one day in the summer it's nice enough to have my window open , and my neighbor has some crew over that's making as much racket as they possibly can . Sigh . 
| Last day in Sylvania ! I'm trying to leave town at 7 tomorrow morning , like that's gonna happen . 
Is on his way to < PROPMALE > ! 
Is irritated . \\prepare for rant . The diagram for my room was backwards so I have a lovely view of a roof . the window is stuck shut , the whole suite smells like alcohol , and half of everything is falling apart and coated in rust . But , I'm in < PROPMALE > so I'm happy . 
is ready for band camp to start ; I think I dislike marching band a little less than I used to . 
Some RA came into the lounge during the clarinet pokemon party and gave us 1 grand worth of magic the gathering cards . fucking score . 
found a cricket in his 6th floor bathroom . Excellence in Action . 
| GAH . Allergies go away ! I don't want to deal with you during band camp . 
| Chances are slim I'm getting into Wind Ensemble this year , there are just wayyyy too many upperclassmen oboists . 
finally got a normal amount of sleep for the first time during band camp . Finishing up our section's tie dye shirts this morning , and then marching band from 1:30 until midnight . Woooooo . 
| My back and feet still hurt from the marching band last night . Overall I'm feeling pretty good about where I am testing-wise but I'm starting to worry about not having enough time to practice oboe . My wind ensemble audition is Saturday and I haven't been able to play at all the past two weeks . 
| Would anyone be interested in picking up < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez at < PROPMALE > airport at 9 PM this Friday ? She lives in < PROPMALE > and will pay for your gas both directions . 
| I must thank the guy who pulled the fire alarm in Beall , without him I would've had a good night's sleep . 
When I say ' butt ' you say ' sex ' ; butt sex ! GO MEAT ! 
| Going to my hall meeting makes me want to falcon kick the fire marshal in the lady parts . There is pretty much nothing that isn't a fire hazard in some way . 
| Ugh . Convocation . Testing time from 2 to 5 , and hopefully I can get some oboe stuff done while I'm at MSP . Dress rehearsal tonight from 7 to 10 . 
Is practicing his oboe outside for the first time ever . 
| Band camp is finally over . Unfortunately , I still won't be getting enough sleep . Pep rally at balls ' o clock tomorrow morning , and then to Chapel Hill with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Banks . 
is watching < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez do poorly at Super Metroid . 
O.o \ 
Lots of work to do today , including buying books , sending out lots \ 
of emails , and bothering people on my floor with above-average oboe \ 
playing . I really should get to bed before I screw up my sleep schedule any more ... 
lost 5 pounds during band camp ! Woot . 
Goddammit , the first night I go to bed early and there is fire drill . 
| Wind Ensemble audition at 7:10 , wish me luck ! 
| Wind ensemble audition went fairly well , but I still don't think I'm going to get it b/c of all the competition . Oh well . 
is already being overwhelmed by 20 credit hours worth of work =( 
| < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez needs to poop faster . 
is really sick . I don't know if I'll be able to perform tomorrow if I don't get better . 
has discovered that when a person is very sick they become proficient at the < PROPMALE > of loafing . 
has several difficult decisions to make ... 
cannot handle the incredible amounts of work that needs to be done for Music Teaching as a Profession . That class is single-handedly destroying my weekend . 
is playing Robot Unicorn Attack while waiting for < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez to get out of bed and come over . 
is heading up to the minute clinic in < PROPFEMALE > ; it seems I have bronchitis and an ear infection now . 
is a few hours into his MTAP homework and hasn't even started the professional reflection yet . Screw this class , I'm watching Hoarders . 
Mtap time . I am not awake enough 
Another fire drill . Add that to the list of things keeping me from doing my mtap homework . 
| I'm tired of being sick . It's been two weeks now and my antibiotics aren't doing anything =( 
| Interview for Tau Beta Sigma , then lots and lots and lots of homework . 
| Interview was a meh . Had a good time loafing at the < PROPFIRST > Pasternack Memorial Couch . 
finally finished his MTAP blog . I didn't get to make < PROPMALE > s tonight , so I have to wake up early and make a few blanks before oboe ensemble and < PROPMALE > class at balls ' o clock . 
is rested and ready for band . I'm trying to be as optimistic as I can about the EWF Closer . 
| So whyyyy did we have a band show two hours away from < PROPMALE > ? It's way past my bed time X_X 
is starting to enjoy the taste of 100% dark chocolate . 
| The Personal Philosophy paper is worth 1/10 of our final grade in MTAP ? S**t , I better get this thing started . 
Lesson learned , don't actively bitch about a class on someone's public facebook status . 
| We're playing Folk Dances in Wind Ensemble <3 
| Yayayyyyy I got a bid for Tau Beta Sigma ! 
| Anyone want to be my roommate next year in Twin or CCC ? 
| So there are only a few ways to fix my computer , all of which involve lots of time . I'll be sitting in the computer lab in Twin for the next 4 hours waiting for a few ISOs to download . Damn you , Microsoft . 
is jumping on the Linux bandwagon ; I fixed my infinitely-looping boot sequence problem in a matter of minutes with Ubuntu and avoided what would have been a $200 repair . 
will be waking up at 2:30 AM to get ready for a long bus ride to Pennsylvania for a game and band show . 
| That may have been the longest day of my life . I'm so happy that I get to sleep now . 
| I'm taking 23 credit hours in the spring , someone please kill me . 
is on his way to becoming a mister sister of Tau Beta Sigma - < PROPFEMALE > Gamma ! 
| TBS candidate meeting , and then going to bed super early . I'm having so much fun that I forget to sleep sometimes =) 
cannot be asked out over Formspring , dates aren't anonymous X_x 
| Wind ensemble . Modern Math exam , then crazy amounts of homework and practicing . This is going to be a very late night , I'm afraid . 
did amazing on his math exam . Now I'm going to finish my MTAP blog and head to MSP to do some last-minute practicing . 
Ther is nothing quite like being in the shower during a fire alarm . I can already tell this is going to be a crappy day . 
has discovered that , despite not liking the clarinet , I enjoy marching band far more than anything else I do here . 
| Doing homework the entire day . My dad's coming to visit this afternoon after he runs the Akron marathon . 
| Fire alarm number 6 , some idiot burnt pizza and smoked out a whole floor . 
has made the decision to do marching band for all four ( or five ? ) years of his college career . 
is strongly considering adding clarinet as his second primary instrument . 
is a hot mess - without the hot . 
| There is nothing quite like not waking up until 7 minutes before you have to leave for class . That was one of the worst nights of sleep I've had in awhile , but after Wind Ensemble I can finally get some rest . 
thinks that someone should start a Robot Unicorn Attack tournament . 
is heading to MSP for a long night of practicing and < PROPMALE > making . I'm praying to the < PROPMALE > god for good weather and for the strength to get me through Barret articulation studies 5-7 during my lesson . 
| The amount of work I can get done tonight will determine if I must pull an all-nighter into Monday ; what a life . 
is going to Rockney's with the clarinetsssss =) 
| Tired , sick , room's a disaster , endless amounts of homework , and TBS studying to do . I don't know how I can get everything done =( 
DOES ANYONE HAVE THE MUED OBSERVATION SCHEDULE ? Several people in MTAP have observations in the morning and the schedule hasn't been posted to Bb yet . 
has bronchitis . Perfect timing , I went almost a week without being sick . 
is saying hell with his observation reflection , there is no way I can write a 3 < PROPFEMALE > paper from 15 minutes of observation at a contest . 
is a drama llama . 
| This will be another super long evening . Scanning worksheets at the library , decorating the TBS board at MSP , and then getting as much homework done as I can before totally crashing in the early hours of the morning . 
got his GPS to work , so it looks like I won't be getting lost on the way to Tallmadge High School this afternoon . 
has learned that 2 shots of espresso can make all the difference in the world . 
is at the library trying to do homework , and of course none of my technology is cooperating . 
| It's midnight and I'm not even close to done . FML . 
| Holy hell I'm just getting to bed , and I'm still not done with all of my work . Looks like I might have to get an extension on that second paper for MTAP . Oh well . Tomorrow ( today ) is going to SUCK . 
| YESSSSS my observation got cancelled tomorrow ! 
is praying to the < PROPMALE > good for a high pressure system all the way through this weekend , I would be able to make some beastly < PROPMALE > s for the Wind Ensemble concert Sunday night . 
| I absolutely refuse to do homework tonight , even the math assignment that is worth 3 thousandths of my final grade . 
| I hate homecoming ! Having a parade and a game just make it even more annoying . 
| Yay today is finally over . Too bad I have stuff to do before bed =( 
| Instead of going to bed , I'm sitting at my desk conducting Kingdom Hearts music . I'm such a dork . 
| Heh , I'm not even close to being done lololol . Future recommendation for MUED majors : don't take MTAP and < PROPMALE > . Psych at the same time . That is all . 
went to MSP to get the observation schedules , but they magically disappeared . I loafed at the < PROPFIRST > Pasternack Memorial Couch for two hours and listened to the Maslanka a lot . Wind Ensemble is awesome . 
got a good amount of sleep for the first time in over a week . But I feel sicker so I'm prolly not going to my teaching observation . 
| Yesssss all of my Engrish horn reed-making supplies came in the mail ! 
| Is anyone really good with computers ? 
| Ugh , it's sprinkling . I guess we can't have two nice days in a row in < PROPMALE > now can we ? 
signed up for 32ish observation hours , now I don't feel so bad about skipping a few of them . 
is sicker than he was yesterday ; this is going to be a fun day . Maybe going up to < PROPFEMALE > to get meds ? 
| First weekend in awhile I don't have crazy amounts of stuff to do ; I'm going to play sooooo many video games . 
| SHIT . How to Train Your Dragon came out yesterday . Must . resist . urge . to . compulsively . shop . 
| Oops , looks like I have a lot more due on Tuesday than I thought . Now I have to do hw tonight =( 
| Going up to < PROPFEMALE > to a clinic to get some meds ( because KSU Health Services thinks people aren't sick on the weekends ) and then to < PROPFEMALE > Farms to do some serious shopping with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez . 
| Longest morning ever . It is shocking how fast one has to drive and run to get to class on-time after being at SE HS . 
is going to the library to be unnecessarily productive . I need to write two observation papers , finish a lesson plan , and do the blogs for next Thursday . Keeping my fingers crossed I can go to bed before 11 =) 
finally got all of his homework done . I got both of my observation reflections , my MTAP blog , my professional reflection , my < PROPMALE > . psych lesson plan , and my math hw done . Like every week , the front end completely sucks , but I'm feeling good that I can finally get some sleep . 
| Yeahhhhhh . I don't think I want to teach young children . 
| I finally get to practice tonight ! Heading to the store , then working on drum and oboe etudes . 
is not feeling to good about his playing test in percussion methods . I would be a terrible drum player , I can't even alternate my hands , let alone roll or flam , and it's half way through the semester lolololol 
doesn't have any purple to wear today =( 
| My < PROPMALE > . psych . class is driving me crazy . The lesson plan I grad < PROPMALE > was a train wreck . I came to the realization that , oh my god , these people are going to be responsible for our children some day . A < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ucation < PROPMALE > should not write like a high-school student . UGH . 
| Modern Math exam from 8-9 , then practicing and < PROPMALE > making until I can't keep my eyes open . 
| Screw the oboe ; I need my sleep . 
| I can't believe I'm saying this , but I'm so happy to go home this weekend . I need a break . 
is back in the Syl ! 
is getting lots of work done . I remembered to make a reduction of the BS fight song ( because C < PROPMALE > is really hard ) and I've gotten a good amount of my MTAP done for the week . Practicing drum pad and clarinet later . 
| Longest day ever . Two observation reflections to write , math to do , and a lesson plan to finish . I'm getting into the sleep-deprived groove again =| 
| getting 10 hours of sleep feels amazing . 
is back on the Facebook - I went almost 3 weeks . Sigh . 
| All of the spam in my inbox is about penis enlargement , E.D. , and Rolex watches . Do I look like a 60 year old man ? 
Dear god people . If you confuse your and you're , their and there , to and too , or pluralize a word with \ ' s \ " I encourage you to drop out of college and pursue a career that does not involve higher cognitive functioning . " 
Days like this make me not want to play the oboe anymore ... 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > McCloskey and < PROPMALE > McCloskey for the new laptop ! This thing is amazing . 
But I don't want to go to wind ensemble this morning ! 
\Fermez la fupa ! \"" 
OH MY GOD . Living room smells like alcohol . 
It's a sad state of affairs when watching \Will it blend\ " videos becomes the highlight of my day . " 
band banquet =( 
An hour of small children is more than I can handle =| 
Hmm , looks like I won't be going to bed anywhere near Midnight . The next few weeks are going to be rough , but I'll manage ( somehow ) . 
Cool , I got my play-n-sing moved back until Monday . Now all I have to worry about is my lesson plan ; shouldn't take longer than 4 or 5 hours . I might actually get to go to bed early tonight =) 
Cool beans , I got my lesson plan done ; now I can go to bed early . Tomorrow is also the first Wednesday in over a month I don't have to wake up at balls ' o clock for an observation , so I get to sleep innnnnnn =) 
I love band ? 
Ew , that game was horrible . 
It is horribly disappointing that none of my Sonic games work on my new laptop ='( 
I need my record player 0____0 
making reeds , re-doing most of my lesson plan ( because apparently being creative is wrong ) and practicing for my play-n-sing . 
of course , the first thing my roommate does when he gets back is blast his trashy people music . Now I regret sending my stereo home . 
Three observations today + my teaching video and lesson plan I have to do later . This day will suck . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > Nielsen . 
Yep , no < PROPMALE > I'm going to bed before midnight . 
Um , there is no way I'm going to have my jury piece ready by Friday . I still don't understand why we're playing them two weeks before juries , but w/e . 
Last observation report . I CAN DO THIS . 
OH MY GOD . I just realized : I'll be a < PROPMALE > at the end of this semester . I can move into a better dorm over winter break ! 
I wish my ears would stop ringing =( 
It amazing that I don't really have to do anything today =) 
is watching How to Train your Dragon with < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez . Woot . 
Holy crap online games are addicting , I've been playing LOTR for four hours now . Yahhhh I should prolly go to bed . 
They've cancelled morning classes at three campuses , so why can't they cancel ours ? I completely do not want to go to percussion methods this morning . 
Blizzard ! 
Hoping and praying that classes will get cancelled tomorrow ... 
\Is this .................................. too salty ? \ " \ 
HMMM . Should I go to my observation tomorrow morning ( which I don't need ) or sleep an extra two hours ? I guess it depends if I can unbury my car . 
OK , I have never complained about a FB layout change before . But this is trully AWFUL . 
I refuse to do anything productive tonight . 
Great , I actually have to be productive today . 
Cool , 99.5% on my TE2 . Makes up for the B I'll prolly get in < PROPMALE > . Psych . 
5 AM . Definitely bed time . Thankfully I don't have exams until Wednesday . 
pleasecanceljuriespleasecanceljuriespleasecanceljuries 
Wooooooooooooooooooo juries are cancelled ! Good bye Mozart ! 
Lake effect is proof God hates < PROPMALE > . 
Lol , worst time of the year to mess my sleep schedule up ; bed at 5AM , up at 2 . 
I'm completely out of food and my car is buried under a foot of snow . F**k . 
I'm not feeling too confident about my < PROPMALE > . Psych exam tomorrow morning . But , compared to the idiots in my class ( which there are many ) I should do very well . 
taking < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez to the airport then going home ! 
Thanks Congress for repealing DADT , now the US isn't as much of a laughingstock amongst first-world countries . 
LOTRO is on Google Maps . Fail . 
Operation ' regain the 18 pounds I lost first semester ' is proving to be successful . 
I'm a little irritated with my lack of final grades , I finished everything last Friday . 
I find it strange that the only grades that have not posted are from professors who only teach a few classes ; clearly there is some procrastination going on . 
3.88 this semester =) I'm glad that I didn't work so hard and deprive myself of sleep for nothing . 
It's obvious Discovery Health is becoming the Oprah Winfrey network , instead of medical-related commercials it's a marathon of starving children in Africa . 
I had a Lord of the Rings and a < PROPMALE > Potter dream at the same time . Many of you were in it . I think it's time to see a therapist xD 
First time seeing the sunrise in over a month =) 
Does anyone have a bassoon methods book I could buy ? 
Heading back to < PROPMALE > tomorrow =) 
God , Intro to Exceptionalities is going to be this semester's MTAP . Even though I'm taking it online , I have the feeling it's going to be very unpleasant . 
I'm not ready to be up at 8 AM . 
Tuesdays and Thursdays are going to be awful again . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > fa me re , me ra do . 
Of course morning classes aren't cancelled , it's blizzarding outside and none of the streets or sidewalks have been cleared . 
First time reading the Daily < PROPMALE > Stater and I find numerous errors in the headline article . Excellence in Action . 
Acoustics ad tech . Blahhhhhh 
Lesson at 9 , studio at 12 . Easy day ( for once ) . 
Moldy fruit cup #2 from dining services . This time , I am sending a strongly-worded email . 
NOOOOOO I don't wanna play in this concert ! I've only loafed for the past 5 hours ! 
Just mixed vanilla-flavored and chocolate-flavored coffee grounds ; I kept waiting for my Keurig to asplode . 
Lotro , Hoarders marathon , lots and lots of coffee ; my life is complete . 
Boring day of loafing . I should prolly get breakfast and start my homework . 
Acoustics and tech is the longest class ever . It's like MTAP , only not terrible . 
I was going to go practice , and then I took a look out of my window . Looks like I'm waking up early tomorrow . 
Bought a vegan bagged lunch today which said \organic fruit bar\ " on the front . I open it up and what do I find ? A Nutri-grain bar . I would love to go a day without getting pissed off at dining services . " 
I'm sick =( I blame the oboists . 
just drank 3 shots of espresso . WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO . 
My honors section of Intro to Ethics surprises me . \What kind of tree does an acorn grow into ? \ " \ " An acorn tree ! \ " OR \ " What does a virtuous hammer do ? \ " \ " HAM ! \"" 
Is anyone else's internet not working on-campus ? 
GOD . I know how to clear the cache and cookies on my browser . Some of us aren't computer-illiterate . Just fix my damn internet ! 
CLASS IS OVER . Can I go now ? 
Bitchy play-n'-sing and flu-related status . 
Like an impoverished child looking for presents on Christmas morning , I wake up every Tuesday and Thursday and check my email for any sign Acoustics and Tech is canceled , only to be disappointed . 
Operation take a three hour nap was successful , now I actually need to apply myself for the rest of the night . 
Let the records show that I am bored with Lotro . I might actually practice over this weekend =+) 
Jeez , NOTHING made before Windows 2000 will work on Windows 7 . I'm depressed I can't run RCT 1 & 2 for more than a few minutes without some kind of problem =( 
Class until noon , then practicing and reed-making the rest of the day ( hopefully ) . 
How are classes canceled ? I don't see a foot of snow on the ground . Oh well , I'm not complaining , I don't have to go to Acoustics and Tech . 
It's hard to watch Youtube videos on my day off over a 768kbps connection ( that's the actual number ) . I wish this useless school would upgrade its connection into the 21st century so it doesn't take 8 minutes to load a 3 minute video . 
And now for my Saturday night ritual of doing all of my SPED homework last minute whilst drinking insane amounts of coffee =) 
Great , the robbery last night was in the parking lot where I park my car . I hate this school . 
Ha , I didn't even know the superbowl was tonight . 
For evidence of how selective the honors program is here , look no further than the people in my ethics class . 
I am entirely too tired to be any more productive today . Going to bed super early . Lesson , < PROPMALE > class , and studio tomorrow , then ( maybe ) going home for the weekend . 
Lesson , < PROPMALE > class , easiest studio class of my life , done ! 
Today wasn't all bad . My lesson went well and my cane came in the mail . 
There is five feet of ice between my back tires and the rest of the parking lot , and my shovel didn't do any good . God help us if parking services would spend money to salt the parking lots before a storm ( or better yet , shovel the sidewalks a week after it stops snowing ) . Looks like I have to get my car towed . 
Awesome , it's getting warmer and there's a < PROPMALE > I may be able to get my car out of the lot today . 
Today's going well . Two old guys helped push my car out of the parking lot and I just went to Wal-Mart ( so my self-esteem is really high ) . Now I just have to procrastinate/study =) 
Acoustics and tech for people with cognitive disabilities . 
These last few days have been horrible . I'm hoping things get better . 
Great , I got a C on my ethics exam ; first C since high school . I don't know how it happened , I felt well-prepared . 
My weekly Thursday ritual of practicing super late has come to an end . Too bad I had three cups of coffee in the past few hours so I won't be able to sleep . Oh well . 
Jeez , one can't go anywhere on this campus without threat of being robbed at knife/gun point . This isn't Toledo ! 
Come on < PROPMALE > State ! You know you want to cancel morning classes ! There's not a shot in hell you'll have any sidewalks/streets plowed by tomorrow morning . 
I'm so pissed we have class , the first time all year those lazy idiots shoveled the sidewalks before it f**king melts . 
may be double majoring ? 
Short nap after theory , then I'll be hitting the practice rooms/studio for the rest of the day . I'm trying to be optimistic that I will get everything done . 
I hate when non-performing arts students use our computer lab . 
STILL waiting for the schedule of classes to go up . 
This F < PROPMALE > arpeggio is going to be the death of me . Beethoven , what were you thinking ? 
I don't care . I'm wearing shorts today . 
Does anyone know what the theory homework was for Monday ? As usual , I wasn't paying attention . 
Gah , while I was practicing it dropped 30 degrees outside . I'm still wearing shorts . I hope it doesn't start snowing ... 
Parents bought me a record player =) Listening to Pink < PROPMALE > makes doing theory hw more enjoyable . 
Honors recital tonight ! I can't wait to get it over with . 
Heading to what is going to be an awful WE rehearsal , then running errands . < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez , I'm finally mailing your crap ! And I'm going to have a shopping spree at the record store =) 
Yay impulse shopping ! 
Lol American Idol is a joke . 
Listening to the soundtracks from the first season of Pokemon and the first two generations of the games --- crazy amounts of nostalgia . 
Great job saxophones ! 
I'm sick AGAIN ='( 
Working on my intro to exceptionalities ( take home ? ) midterm the whole day =( 
I've been procrastinating for the past 6 hours , now I feel like < PROPMALE > McCloskey . 
After 5 cups of coffee , two bottles of V8 fusion , and half a pound of Club crackers , I'm finally done with my Intro to exceptionalities midterm . This calls for a FB hashtag . #hotmesswithoutthehot 
I hate Mondays almost as much as I hate my roommate . And that's saying something . 
3 hour naps are amazing . 
Great , it's midnight and I'm wide awake . Might as well be productive =) 
I am in an uncharacteristically good mood today ... 
I want to see Avenue Q 
Alcoholic awareness day ? 
Concert could have gone better , but all that matters is that IT'S FINALLY OVER . 
Strange conversation of the day :\ 
Dad : \You didn't bring any colds back 
YAY I GOT MY FIRST GIG ! 
I had a dream my oboe cracked . Worst nightmare ever . 
Freaking out about lots of things . 
Now I'm starting to regret not being more productive over break ; I now have more to do than I have time for . 
Wow , I can't believe I spent most of my break doing absolutely nothing important . 
I really like hokey music . No joke . 
In honor of < PROPMALE > State's sexual assault awareness crap , let's remember that [ quote ] \1/3 of woman will raped in her lifetime \"." 
Everyone should go to < PROPFIRST > Klein's Oboe Recital ! 
Just over an hour until my Ethics exam . It's going to violate me . 
It's \point out obvious weather conditions\ " day . IT'S FUCKING SNOWING . Grrrrrrr . " 
Woo , I had an amazingly productive evening despite goofing off all afternoon . Tied four reeds , finished two and one other . Tomorrow won't be absolutely terrible . 
I'm freaking out that I can't register for strings ( section is closed ); I haven't even taken string tech I yet . 
I would like to take a moment to express my extreme dislike of my special < PROPMALE > . class . 
Woke up this morning with March to the Scaffold in my head ; this is going to be a great day . 
Complain , complain , complain , complain , complain , complain , complain . 
My paper about deafness is crap-tastic . I submitted it two minutes before the deadline . Procrastination ftw ! 
Hmmm . What piece should I wake my roommate up with ? How about Mars . 
Could anyone in theory print off the homework for me ( the chorale) ? Turns out , that time I spilled laundry detergent all over my printer did , in fact , break it . 
I'm trying to decide if this day is going to be good or terrible . All depends on WE I suppose . 
Reading my acoustics & tech homework corrections makes me angry . 
I'm happy with my decision to skip my ethics class and get an extra two hours of sleep . Now I see why , on any given day , a quarter of our class doesn't show up . 
Reeds reeds reeds reeds reeds not practicing reeds reeds reeds reeds 
Word to the wise , don't eat the scrambled eggs at Eastway this morning . I just threw them up . 
I'm actually in a good mood . Playing in a musical is like playing in WE , only at the end of the rehearsal I don't want to slit my wrists . 
Crossing my fingers for overtime pay . 
Well , it's referred to as \hell week\ " for a reason . " 
I'm not exactly sure how I can get everything done that I need to do . All I can do at this point is try . 
Hmmm . I'm not accustomed to working a lot . I think I'd rather be lazy . 
Oops , two-ish weeks until juries . I better get on that . 
I am so over this class . 
One more show then I'm DONE . 
Because the first thing I want to do after playing five 3-hour shows is go to tonight's rehearsal . 
Insert bitchy status about piano reduction for theory here . 
I hate when people are stuck-up know-it-alls . 
Well , I can't stay on-campus next year because there aren't any decent rooms left . And most of the good apartments are full by now . I'm so screwed . Transferring ? Certainly revisiting the idea now that I don't have anywhere to stay next year . 
Would anyone like to room with me in a triple room in Stopher next year ? X_X 
I have now found 5 completely seperate cracks in my oboe's top joint which magically appeared overnight . This is so depressing , it went 3 years without cracking and must be trying to make up for it . 
The last two days have been absolutely horrible . It's nice to see things turning around . 
Wow .... my dorm is really quiet ! Yay for Easter . 
This paper I'm about to turn in is absolutely terrible . Like most papers I put little thought into , I'm relying on big words to bolster my arguments and save my grade . 
Soooooo the only remaining chapter in my sped textbook is about gifted students . It only makes sense that we're not going to cover that chapter ; gifted students don't matter ! 
This week is going to be rediculous . Coffee is my best friend . 
F**k that f**king assbag that set the fire alarm off . 
I'm going to make Brahm's 6th Hadyn variation my new ringtone . 
Hm , study for my exams or loaf ? Easy choice . I'm going to watch Hoarders . 
I'm watching Dr. < PROPMALE > . I have officially hit rock-bottom . 
No , pour ME a cup of yesterday . 
Yeah ... I'm not going to be productive tonight . Listening to Pokemon soundtracks is much more fun . Don't judge . 
Three take-home essay question for my ethics class . Each can be answered in less than a paragraph . Bullshit them into 6+ pages altogether = A on exam . 
I haven't had coffee since last Thursday . Considering that I normally drink 4 or 5 cups per day and I no longer have a headache , I think I've kicked the stuff . 
The half of the practice room hallway got quiet as soon as I started playing really high scales as loud as I can . Win . 
Great job orchesterrrr ! 
Does anyone know what the exam week parking regulations are ? I tried calling parking services but no one was there . Their answering machine politely told me to piss off . 
I'm actually kind of glad it's raining . My older good reeds might start working again ^_^ 
I passed my barrier with flying colours , I shat all over my practical ( but at least I did it ) AND the sun is out ! It's nice to see things go okay for once . 
Feeling lotssss better . This is going to be a good summer . 
I got a 100% on my ethics final ! Not bad for skipping half the semester =D 
All you can eat buffets are amazing , especially when it's not < PROPFEMALE > corral . 
I made it from Streetsboro to my house in exactly 2 hours . How have I not gotten a speeding ticket ? X_X
