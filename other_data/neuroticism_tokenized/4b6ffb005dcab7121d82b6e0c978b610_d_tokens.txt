Wondering where my damn kid is ... 

Check in Kiddo ;-) 
Blessed by Kealy & < PROPMALE > :-) 
So excited < PROPMALE > is coming home this weekend ... to clean the pool :-) 
<< Kip Osborough the aspiring horticulture < PROPMALE > returned home for the weekend to a bunch of underwatered and dead plants ... 2 hours ago >> LMAO ! 
Let the game begin ... 
\to the < PROPFIRST > belong the spoils ... \"" 
Today I am buying a helmet ... :-) 
Chocolate covered raspberries and needing a fix ... 
Game on < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ! 
is so very excited about her Christmas plan ! Both kids are game and one doesn't even know what the plan is . Love it ! < PROPMALE > don't tell her :-) xxx-ooo Cynnie 
Off to start the meetings of the week with one of her fav home builders :-) 
is off to the gym ! 
is so very happy < PROPMALE > is coming home for a month . Can't wait to see you again babe :-) BTW .... there is still no tree up , sorry kiddo . Come home and make me get one ! xxx-ooo 
< PROPMALE > is home tonight :-) Drive safe kids ! 
Kid is home for Christmas , I am blessed :-) 
Its gonna get ugly around here if I get hit with one more cyber snowball ! It will be an explosion of usesless FB apps raining down on someones head ... Bev ;-) 
Just got the call from the vet , < PROPFEMALE > is officially neutered :-) Sorry Silke ! 
Congratulations to Ms. Kealy < PROPFIRST > Osborough , graduating from Old Dominion University tomorrow . So very proud of you babe :-) xxx-ooo Tinnie 
One through college and the next one was halfway there until he informed me tonight he was probably staying for his masters ... sigh . So close :-) 
Needs her head examined ... 
LOL , if you walk into my office today , you will have to look at graduaton pix ... be warned ;-) 
One might ask what you gave , as you complain about what you received . 
Great < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > got me shit listed by < PROPFEMALE > ;-) <3 
is excited to be going shopping tomorrow with her kids . And since I hate shopping ... and crowds ... we should have a grand time :-) 
Survived shopping with the kids ! Had fun and am quite over shopping for another year :-) 
It's day 9 after < PROPFEMALE>'s neuter ... this dog needs to run ... I need this dog to run ... he has eaten all of his toys , nothing left but the scraps of mauled pieces I keep finding . Chime in Dobie gf's ;-) 
just picked up her new glasses ... and realized she was really viewing the world through some scratched up lenses ;-) 
I got BIRDS ! Lots of them ! BOOYAH ! Off to buy some bincos so I can actually see them :-) 
How about a little Confiture extra Griotte on an English Muffin this morning , yeah-that's right I now speak French ;-) Actually , what is really on my mind this morning is the whole English Muffin thing-I pick up these muffins from Trader < PROPFIRST>'s they are called , British Muffins ... located right next to the ENGLISH muffins . What am I missing ? 
< PROPFEMALE > & Womble New Homes team check out cyndiozone.blogspot.com, I'll figure out how to make it a sign-in thing later , been sitting here too long & my neck hurts ;-) 
Just got back from new nest , stairs are stained-love the color :-) Tomorrow is cleaning day . Everything is on schedule to begin the move next Friday . Where is my little band of volunteers ;-) 
is drinking wine ... its white , which she hates and its in a kitchen glass cuz she packed all the wine glasses and can't find them ;-) 
spent the afternoon with < PROPMALE > laying on couches , we found the perfect one at Esprit Decor-love that store ! Kitchen table from Pier 1 , can now have a party with 6 people ;-) 
off to line her new nest with bits of threads and twigs ... down to rugs & blinds :-) 
is wondering how she could have possibly given birth to two of the slowest moving kids on the planet ... just ridiculous how long it takes either one of them to get ready to go somewhere ... 
can't handle what is going on here right now ... Kip has managed to cut his finger with a razor blade trying to get a splinter out . I am either gonna pass out or puke ;-) 
Anyone tried to rent a U-Haul lately ? Good grief ! So many price adding gauntlets to get through . I just want the $19.95 truck ! No boxes , pens , knives , tape , blankets , < PROPFEMALE>'s , furniture wheely things , storage units , moving guys , piano moving guys , and whatever else I just got asked ... I'm so confused ! 
Let your joy scream across the pain . ~ Ezbeth Wilder 
After months of dreaming about it , it's finally here ~ moving to the new nest today :-) Thanking my friends for their support and encouragment these past few weeks ( months ) , wouldn't be smiling today without you :-) <3 
Loaded up my SUV 3x with boxes while my wonderful kids stayed at the new place and unpacked them . It's really coming together ! Tomorrow is furniture moving day with my two favorite personal trainers using their muscles for something productive ;-) W/D , new couch , < PROPFEMALE > table & some pieces I lucked out and got from one of my builder clients selling his former model furniture all tomorrow . Oh , & the cable guy , big day ! 
Spent her first night in the new nest . Bed felt like bliss last night , after a long day yesterday . < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > could not have done it without you guys ! The best ! Now I am learning more about flexible vinyl duct than I ever wanted or thought I needed to know ... 
Have Internet now at new place , it fixed itself ! Miracle :-) Now to figure out the dryer ... 
is in the laundry biz . Wow , I should have bought a new w/d long time ago , laundry just got fun :-) I think I just dried jeans in like 15 mins ... seems like anyway , gonna wash some more and time them this time :-) 
Back to work after 3 days of moving , can't find anything but thanks to my kids and friends , I am mostly unpacked . Tonight it's a blinds & wine party :-) My thanks again to all who supported me , physically & emotionally- couldn't have done it without you all <3 
What could possibly be more fun than two females , a power drill , and a bottle of wine ... so < PROPFEMALE > calls her husband because we can't figure out why we can't get the drill bit to go any deeper in the wall around the sliding glass door ... he says we were probably hitting flashing . He called back to make sure we didn't get electrocuted :-) Window treatments < PROPMALE > ! 
< PROPFEMALE > officially moves to the new nest tomorrow night , been missing him :-( He is going to Aunt Silke's first so that Heady can run him into the ground :-) Make him nice and tired ... hopefully ! 
is operating with her butt on fire today . Half the team is at the Builders Show and it seems like whoever was holding their finger in the busy dam decided to let go ;-) Love it :-) 
My < PROPFEMALE > boy is back with me . He's been velcro dog all night :-) Missed my boy , glad he is here . Thanks Nishnick for helping me out with that table , appreciate you ! Driving out here tonite was above and beyond the call of duty , you are definitely on the party list , in first position :-) 
Good < PROPFEMALE > feeling gone , heading out in this cold flippn rain for 4th time trying to poop this dog ... 
House audio guys are here hooking up all the fancy stuff that I will never figure out how to operate and my new < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is painting my just installed swinging french door-gorgeous ! 
is donning 2 pair of socks on her freezing feet & taking < PROPFEMALE > to play with Silke , Heady & Ruger in the rain ... then she is coming home , turning on the fireplace , pouring a glass of wine and trying to figure out what all these buttons do on the remote to the plasma installed today :-) 
Slept in till 7:30 what bliss , hahahaha . Off to the gym , then to Lowe's .... amazing , I actually like Lowe's now-there's some cool stuff in there I just never noticed before :-) 
Has moved her wine collection to the new nest :-) At the risk of sounding terribly materialistic ... this makes me happy . I'm talking good Napa Valley stuff from the days when I could afford to belong to wine clubs ;-) 
Phew , this man stuff is complicated ... I have managed to somehow unscrew the wrong part of the studfinder trying to figure out where the 9-volt goes ... this little < PROPFEMALE > mother board looking thing dropped on the floor . Not good ;-) Finally figured out how to put the pieces back togther , stripped the screw ... and noticed that the battery section just slides out on the bottom ... guess I should have read the instructions :-) 
Thought I was ready for the < PROPFEMALE > walks in the rain , bought him a rain slicker-not trying to play doggie dressup here , just thought it would keep him dry and warmer in this crap weather . So this morning I was excited to test it out , the rain is coming down sideways right now .. & I discover , after 15 mins of trying to get him to do more than stand there in the rain , that he won't pee with the coat on .... Grrrr ! 
is home feeling like crap today ... but things are looking up , my number 2 brainiac , JeffA is coming over tonite and making all my < PROPMALE > stuff sync , jive , stream iTunes through my house audio .... and make coffee ;-) All wireless ! And he's bringing Imperial Palace . It's < PROPFEMALE>'s soup night , sorry < PROPMALE > ! 
is catching up with a very old friend , how cool is FB < PROPFEMALE > :-) 
is hanging blinds with Kealy ... I have a headache ... 
If you know me well , you know that I am________ , I love________ , and I can't stand________ . 
Bundling up and taking < PROPFEMALE > out to play in the SNOW !! WhooHoo ! :-) 
Snowed in at the new nest with plenty of wine , cheese & crackers , gas logs & a tired , from his morning romp in the white stuff , dog :-) 
Two weeks today since the move , I used my gas cook top for the first time . I had to call Kealy and ask her how to turn the thing on ... then I made grilled cheese . LOL . 
is trying to decide if she has the discipline to layer up one more time today and take < PROPFEMALE > out for some exercise . It's a frosty 27 degrees , feet are still cold from our earlier treks making yellow snow in the winter wonderland ... 
just meringue'd herself in the tub ... all those years of selling new construction and telling people not to add bubble bath to a jetted tub ... I decided to test it ... will be scooping bubbles out for the next week ;-) 
Smelling yummy in the nest tonight-impromptu meal with what I had on hand : saute'd chicken/shallots/yellow pepper/garlic in < PROPFEMALE > oil , roasted fresh brussels in < PROPFEMALE > oil/garlic & sea salt , and brown rice . For all those that worry , its not a can't cook thing with me , its a don't ;-) 
off to muck around with Silke & the doberman gang in the aftersnow-that dingy , ugly , wet , polluted mess left behind ... 
is listening to < PROPFEMALE > snore , such a peaceful sound ... it means I don't have a doberman up my butt every 5 seconds wanting me to play with him ... 
just made carrot cake breakfast cookies for tomorrow's sales meeting . Not bad ! Be even better with cream cheese frosting ... but that would defeat the purpose of making a wholesome , semi-healthy breakfast treat ;-) 
Just made her kick ass meatloaf . That's 3x this oven's been used in 2.5 weeks . I am on a roll :-) 
is a coffee snob , whatever this junk is I pressed this morning fresh ground from < PROPMALE > Teeter ... its not coffee , some glorified coffee flavored tea maybe , but not coffee . Give me Starbucks ! And the next time someone wonders what to get me , make it an expresso machine ;-) 
off to the gym , then a massage :-) then Kealy's coming to play ! Yeah ! 
is over drilling and drill bits ... broke one off in the wall , the valance is < PROPMALE > . It might be crooked , I am not looking at it anymore . And I am refusing to think about drilling blind brackets . < PROPFIRST > , I am ready for your handyman ;-) 
off to the gym and to find a new place to get toes done :-) 
had a little wine emergency-couldn't figure out how to use this Pampered Chef cork screw . Had to call my wine opener expert , Kealy , because I destroyed the cork on a rather nice bottle of Cakebread Syrah ... my dutiful girl came right over and took care of the problem . And showed me how to use what turned out to be a very simple cork screw ... now I have two bottles of wine uncorked . Drink up ;-) 
LOL ! Was talking to a friend this morning , he said my new nest was like waking up every morning in a nice hotel ( no , he did not wake up here ... ) and it hit me , I've created my own B&B , complete with < PROPFEMALE > butter & fresh ground , pressed coffee in the morning ... I see doilies in my future :-) 
is one of those people who's life can turn into a \oh shit\ " direction in a nano second ;-) Took < PROPFEMALE > out for a run at Culpepper Landing . The Great Dismal Swamp encroached CL today-what a muddy mess . Swamp dog jumps in the back of my vehicle willingly-usually its a fight ... I reward him with a pocketful of treats ... that also contained the 800 mg of IBU I forgot to take this morning for my shoulder ... " 
< PROPMALE > turns 20 this week , happiest of birthdays baby boy :-) I can remember being 20 ... for five bucks I could buy a beer , a pack of cigarettes AND put gas in my car . Those were the days they say ... these are better ones :-) 
off to gym :-) 
It's 9PM coffee or wine ? 
Would like to personally thank < PROPMALE > for creeping me out ... LOL ! Thanks < PROPMALE > ;-) 
Is in the middle of a hair crisis ... blow dryer just up and decides not to come on this morning ?! WTH ?! I think my horoscope missed this event ... 
is happy that I am not as inept with a remote as previously suspected . Couldn't figure out why no pic on tv-could hear it , never saw it ;-) house wiring genius guy here , he can't figure it out either :-) Driven me nuts for 3 days ... 
Kealy's here :-) 
How about Kealy < PROPFIRST > Osborough and MIM quit hogging my computers ;-) 
Tonight the unthinkable happened , I actually locked myself out of my house . First and last time for everything ;-) Thanks < PROPFEMALE > G ! 
is so happy that there is no alarm tomorrow morning :-) 
Today at The Nest B&B < PROPFEMALE > has made a mangled bacon & cheese omelet ( if < PROPMALE > was here , he could make one that was Southern Living mag cover quality ) but it eats good , so the hell with presentation ... Oh ! & grits ! Don't forget the grits . Its a southern thing Mr. < PROPFIRST > :-) 
is contemplating making < PROPFIRST > cookies ... but it's feeling entirely too domestic . Kippy-cuts outs with sprinkles ;-) 
Oh please make my day and tell me one time I was smarter than < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > .... 
OMG it's gone from bad to worse ... not only is he consistently more right than I am ... he is now flippn ahead of me in MW . How did that happen I ask myself ? I have had 200 levels on him for months ... WTG < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > :-) And I am just pretending to be happy about this ... 
is actually watching tv :-) every two years I figure out how to turn one on and watch the O's! 
7 sales for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Homes this week from my A teams at Sommerton & Summer Park ! Whoo-hooo ! Awesome week girls & guy ! And no < PROPFIRST > , this does not mean price increase ;-) 
Currently slow cooking in a low oven for the next 3 hours , one BBQ'd beef brisket in anticipation of Mr. Cutie Patootie < PROPMALE > joining me for dinner at the next tomorrow night :-) 
Ok , where's my horoscope app ? I need to see what mood I am in and get out of here ... 
I am in the mood to bring Kopi home to her new nest . Three Saturdays of snow have deterred me ... it's time :-) 
off to meet up with Silke to let the dobes run , then my < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is coming for dinner :-) 
R&W gang-new post on the blog . It's about washers & dryers ... and strippers . Yeah got you attention now ;-) 
Wants to get her hands on KTO , hug him , feed him , get him back to rights-then slap him on the ass and send him back out into the world ... 
Three dobes running like a pack of wild things around the lake tonite . It's pitch dark and wooded . Silke & I hear them barking ahead of us like they have cornered something . We approach-typical Silke marches right up to the big dark blob the dogs have surrounded and are barking menacingly at ... 
Putting on the heels one more time today to go celebrate with our agents who are being recognized tonight for actually selling houses last year :-) But I'd really rather be putting my feet up , eating popcorn & M&M's and watching the Olympics ... 
is wishing she wasn't quite so independent at times , like today-moving Kopi from old house to new nest . This will be a task ... should have lined up help ;-) 
Today is a < PROPFEMALE > 60 degree gift from the weather god ! Kealy is here to help me get Kopi's cage together then we are off to play outside :-) 
Awesome day and Kopi is HERE !! More later :-) 
Awww this is the best , Kopi's in on my shoulder , < PROPFEMALE > is sitting here with his head in my lap and my kid is on chat wanting to know whether he should take calc this summer or do an internship at the zoo ... LMAO 
OMG ! There are times that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is the funniest man I know . We had some discussion on why my kids and pets all have names starting with K . And he says : < PROPFIRST > : I am just glad Kotex was taken before you named Kealy ........ haha LMAO ! <3 MIM 
Had a visit from a handyman tonight , Kopi now has blinds in her room and won't be waking me up at 6AM tomorrow ! 
Be real . Zero tolerance for those who are not . 
Spent the afternoon at the top selling single family community in Chesapeake and watched one of it's home builders accept the reality of the market and agree to get real on the selling price of their house . < PROPFIRST > & Doreen-get it sold girls ! 
Off to the gym & it's Kealy night & the nest ! Sorry babe , next week ! <3 
Should I be insulted by the fact that this is like the 3rd Thursday Kealy has come to visit and been MONOPOLIZED by my good friend MIM ??! Hmmm ? 16 will get you 20 < PROPMALE > ;-) Hahahahahahahaha 
Scones vs Gingersnaps , what shall I bake ? < PROPMALE > you are going to be amazed at my culinary prowess :-) I think it's my fab kitchen , it's very motivating ! ~ 
Off to take pix of < PROPMALE>'s new training facility . Bummer-no floor laying ;-) 
is trapped in Gingersnap cookie dough hell ... seemed a great idea at the time but I don't want to spend the rest of my life rolling dough into little balls ... how much freaking dough can there be ? I think it's expanding ... 
Was talking to my Scottish friend tonight , who told me he loved my accent . How absolutely funny considering ... :-) 
Oh crap , have an accountability meeting in 2 hours with my partner < PROPFIRST > G ... and the 1812 emails I committed to putting in folders or deleting has grown to 1842 ... how am I going to account for that ? Email breeds like rabbits ;-) 
Ok this is ridiculous , I am torn between going out to Starbucks or leaving my beautifully detailed vehicle in the garage so it doesn't get spots on it ( raining ) ... 
It snowed ? Never heard a word about snow . Did we know this was going to happen ? I need to start watching something other than Animal Planet ;-) 
Kealy and wine tonight , looking forward to the company & the vintage :-) It's Little O night MIM ! Expect you to be in better spirits . 
Jeez , I lose Kealy to a movie with < PROPFIRST > ? Hey Bubba , get off my turf ;-) Going to have to finish a bottle of wine ... 
Fresh ground beans from San < PROPFIRST > Bay Coffee Co ... smells awesome . I'll report back < PROPMALE > :-) 
is wondering why all these college kids are walking wounded this semester ? Come kiddo's to the nest , I will patch you all up :-) No grumps allowed ! 
< PROPMALE > is due here within 30 or so , he will be so very pleased . Brought home a feast from Imperial Palace-all his favs :-) Feed him first , then we will fix all of his bad behavior ;-) 
Walked in for my massage tonight and < PROPFEMALE > squealed when she saw me and then big hug-love that Gabby girl :-) Then she tortured me ... 
Fluffy omelette's , coffee I just ground and pressed , sausage from the local butcher-like so fresh I probably drove past that pig last week and now he's not out there in his little pen ... and my kid , great way to start the weekend at the nest :-) 
Has a date with < PROPMALE > & Tay ... and < PROPFEMALE > :-) 
Oh Lord , I forgot what it was like to take < PROPMALE > with me to the grocery store . I went from a 2 bag girl to 10 bags ;-) Guess we are cooking this week :-) 
Loved < PROPFEMALE > ! And the best part ? We get to the ticket guy and he asks me if I have my glasses ... I instinctively look at my purse , then look at him and ask him why I needed my glasses ... and really am wondering how would he know I even have glasses ... then he tells me , the tickets are for the 3D showing . LMAO ! Cool ! Had no clue , it was awesome :-) < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > had a fit of laughter ... 
My mother is coming for lunch and to see the nest . < PROPMALE > & I have a bet . If I can get this over and done with in an hour and a half , he washes dishes the rest of the week . Now the part I haven't told him , I'm heading to the gym this morn , only counting time from the moment I walk back in the door ... he may be entertaining without me for a bit ;-) 
I want an iPad ~ ! <3 Apple :-) 
is wondering how many times < PROPMALE > can possibly wreck the same car .... 
Family dinner at the nest tonight-celebrating Kealy & < PROPMALE>'s birthdays :-) What shall we make ? My only eats chicken kid is putting governors on the menu options ... 
Family dinner foiled , Kealy had to work . Turned into family breakfast , < PROPMALE>'s omelettes-very yummy . Wonderful way to start Sunday , with the kids . Tomorrow Kealy is 23 , so very hard for me to believe . What an incredible young woman she is :-) 
Wondering why < PROPMALE > is so at arms about the tomato famine at Va Tech , when he always picks them off his salad anyway ;-) 
Breakfast in the morning at The Broken Egg with < PROPFEMALE > G & < PROPFEMALE > :-) ( and < PROPFIRST > if you show up and start that FB/Tweetn video crap , not only are you buying , but I am also going to give you indigestion ;-) 
is playing site agent today at The Preseve on the < PROPFEMALE > . Last time I did this was at Governor's Pointe and I actually sold one for < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > :-) I have a repuation to uphold , no pressure ;-) 
Kealy night at the nest ! :-) 
Finally on a real computer ( < PROPMALE > ) and not some POC PC ! Thanks < PROPMALE > , my IT guru-you have improved my temper this afternoon tremendously ... being on that < PROPMALE > was like trudging through mud :-) 
Has been reading the latest on the Chinese Drywall saga & is officially changing the name to \imported drywall\ " because it sounds better ... ever the sales person :-) " 
New Homes Preview today at Greenbrier Mall , come by and see me I'll be at the Culpepper Landing booth conveniently located next to Dillards ;-) 
is contemplating a bottle of Peju 2005 Syrah Napa Valley or taking < PROPFEMALE > out to burn off some juice ... so far the grapes are in first place :-) 
Took < PROPFEMALE > out for a big adventure in this awesome weather-he is snoring now , worn out dog , best sound ever :-) 
is sitting in a meeting with her one of her favorite home builders and someone is missing ... now I am forced to sit next to Tom ... Stephen , where are you ;-) 
is contemplating lopping off heads ... 
and he is out , crashed on the kitchen floor . Chased a herd of deer tonight , that was pretty awesome ! Love a tired < PROPFEMALE > :-) 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! How'd did you remove that post ! Where is < PROPFIRST > ? She saw it ! 
bought a grill a Walmart ( sorry < PROPFIRST >!) $30 it's not very big , says \24 Burger Capacity\ " that's ambitious .... maybe if they're sliders ;-) Two steaks would fit though :-) " 
knew better than to get sucked into 72 < PROPFEMALE > degrees a few days ago , cold & wet again ... I'm developing that disorder :-( LOL 
In vino veritas :-) 
I ain't here to do anything halfway Dont give a damn What anyone might say I just want to freefall for a while Wild at Heart ~ Gloriana 
\He is able who thinks he is able . \"~ Buddha speaks to < PROPMALE > ;-) " 
is relieved her kid is stable again ... hahahahahahahaha <3 
is making a ham with bourbon glaze ... this year she will remember to cook the alcohol out of the glaze first ... Kealy & < PROPMALE > called it \drunken ham\ " :-) Happy Easter all ! " 
on my mind ? I have recently been told that my FB wall is boring . Yes , boring . This is just unacceptable . Game on Mr. Hale ;-) 
Way to go , WHOOT ! to my Culpepper Landing-20 sales to date , Sommerton ( 10 ) & Old Beach Village ( 7 ) sales teams ! Great effort guys ! Proud of you all :-) 
Is waiting for her accountability partner to show up for our 2:30 appointment ... 
Day two of being told I have a boring wall , where are all my damn peeps ? Come on girls-come out and play ;-) 
Should I be concerned that my son wishes to be a faun ... prancing around all day while eating Turkish Taffy ? Time to get that kid home ! ;-) 
Still dealing with a son who is half boy , half goat ... 
Life is about not knowing , having to change , taking the moment and making the best of it , without knowing what's going to happen next . ~ Gilda Radner It's official , Kealy's life with < PROPFIRST > will take her to California . And I am ok with this , today . Someone remind me of that fact later this year when the move takes place ;-) 
is wondering how many times she has to lose skin on her fingers before < PROPFEMALE > gets it that she is not letting go of his toes while using the Dremel on his nails ... bonehead dog ! 
Gave Kopi and bath and took her out in the sun to dry :-) < PROPFEMALE > and I are laying low , glad you love it out there Jacque-we say it's hot as ..... 
< PROPMALE > will be home in 7 days & Kealy moves back in by the end of the month while < PROPFIRST > is in training . No doubt by August I will be ready for them to move on again , but for now-so very excited about the changes in my life and this summer :-) <3 
Putting on my face this morning , noticed small spot-something different on my cheek ... can't see , pull out mag mirror ... Ah shit , it has feet ! Flip out . Panic . Grab hydro peroxide , hair spray and whatever else I can find . No alcohol up here , used it on < PROPFEMALE > , it's downstairs ... not willing to leave this bathroom and play host to this creepiness one more second ... ticks happen ;-) Blech ! 
is conducting an experiment . How long will it take < PROPMALE > ( who has been in remarkable spirits of late ) to lather himself into a proper fit ( let's call them episodes ) when he finds out his sister needs his bed and I will be downsizing him to the trundle thing ... but since he mostly sleeps on the couch , maybe he will be chill with this ... 
PDH ! 
< PROPMALE > just want this one pic not your whole damn album how do I make that work ? 
is on vacation , a week ahead of : puttering , sleeping in , maybe do some painting , kid proof my nest ( Kealy & < PROPMALE > ... hahaha ) the gym , the doberman gang coming here for club meeting-will feel like my first social :-) picking up < PROPMALE > from VT on Thursday !, and it all ends in a lovely weekend with someone quite special to me :-) Please everyone , < PROPFEMALE > on .... 
Off to Lowe's to find a needle in a haystack ... need a washer for my hose ... Jeez , I am not this patient , that is a big place ... 
If you receive a white box with a blue bow from me I did not send it to you . I like you too much to send such BS gifts ... go to your apps and delete the application BFF gifts . It is some kind of self populating garbage ! 
is about to change the way things are done around here . It's all good , no panic in the streets please ... :-) 
is bittersweet . Tonight will end 20 years of sitting through dance recital rehearsals watching Kealy . Tomorrow night will be her last show . Proud of you babe-what a phenomenal commitment on your part , through college and working to continue your dance <3 
Family breakfast at the Nest . < PROPMALE > is making his awesome omellete , I am helping .... Kealy is cozied up in the squishy chair ... drinking coffee , with her little doggie on her lap ... watching Zorro ... We will make her clean it all up ;-) 
Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind . \Pooh ! \ " he \ 
Just wanted Kealy & < PROPMALE > to know I am enjoying them in the nest tonight :-) Walking the dog(s ) though one doesn't really count as a dog ... more like one of those stuffed animals I used to get autographs on as a kid ... cleaned the kitchen and Kopi's cage , helped with dinner-nice , I may get used to this :-) 
< PROPMALE > and I are watching the one show that fascinates and appalls me-I watch despite my disgust at these pageant moms living vicariously through their precocious prodigy ... Toddlers & Tiaras night ;-) 
WTG < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Revell & < PROPFEMALE > Giuliano , RDB's week 20 report Culpepper Landing remains #1 on the leader board for Y-T-D sales of the \ 
128 communities Southside & Peninsula reporting ! 21 sales so far in \ 
' 10 ! You rock girls ! 
Spending the day in reports , can you tell ? Kudos to the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Homes & Neighborhoods team : < PROPFEMALE > Godsell & < PROPFEMALE > West at Sommerton and < PROPFEMALE > Smith Halman & < PROPFEMALE > Hubbard at Summer Park with 20 sales YTD in Chesapeake ! I think this deserves a concession < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ... ( as she sets < PROPFIRST > up for the kill ... ) 
it's going to be 99 degrees here today and the two whitest kids I know are going to the beach ... They just don't make a SPF high enough to protect < PROPMALE > & Tay ... enjoy yourselves today , see you tonight with the aloe :-) And don't be late for Granny visit ! Sun poisoning no excuse ;-) 
< PROPMALE>'s latest art-amazing :-) 
The only thing better than pulling a good sweat at the gym is coming home and washing it all off :-) 
Leaving Kealy doing her P90X in my family room , heading to Flex to work out with < PROPFIRST > , check out the awesome salad the kids put together last night . Fab ! :-) 
Just got her butt kicked in by the ARC machine at One Life ... looking forward to < PROPMALE > making Chicken Breasts with Mango Peach Salsa-What a kid ! :-) 
has felt like crap & slept most of the day away , and if I am up all night because of it , that is really going to frustrate me ... 
is enjoying the nest restored to peace & tranquility , < PROPMALE > , Kealy & Scooter are elsewhere this evening . Love them all but ... Kai is calm , Kopi is mumbling to herself ... and I am enjoying not listening to a tv with screaming brides and cake bosses on it :-) 
is apparently revisiting Margaritaville with Kealy (& < PROPMALE > ) today-but this time < PROPMALE > can be the DD ;-) 
< PROPMALE > Osborough the fashion God ? The < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > of Chesapeake ? Wearing the same clothes for three damn days ?! Yuck ! Come back to the nest and change please ;-) 
has reached the take it , or leave it stage . 
OMG ! < PROPMALE > is making Chicken Parm-my absolute favorite ! Love this kid ! :-) 
Woke up this morning to the sound of rain and thunder :-) A welcome change of pace from the oppressive swamp air and relentess sun ( I can't believe I actually just said that ... ) 
Looking forward to catching up with an old friend and dinner at Mahi Mah's tonight :-) Yum ! 
< PROPMALE > & I watching this atrocity of parenthood , Toddlers & Tiaras . Come on Mom's let's turn our daughters into baby < PROPFEMALE > hoochies ... I remember how many times someone told me I should have entered Kealy in pageants when she was little ... dance recital once a year was enough trauma for me ;-) 
Kealy & < PROPMALE > are at the nest creating tonight's wine & cheese fest . Stay tuned :-)

off to take < PROPFEMALE > for a bike ride ... sans helmet ;-) 
heading to the gym to do cardio with < PROPFIRST > the relentless ... 
is restless ...

Sunday morning and grits-I wonder how there can be places in the US that are gritless-ask for them , and the waitress looks at you like you have a problem ... it baffles me ;-) 
3 limes mauled and I finally figured out how to use the zester ... simple really , once you do it correctly ;-) My hands smell nice and limey :-) Tex Mex Shrimp Cocktail with mangos , avocados and red pepper jelly ! 
Waiting patiently for < PROPMALE > to get up so we can get back in the zone on the project we are working on ... 
loves the feeling of favorite tennis shoes-you know , the totally broken in ones-after they have been washed , happy feet :-) Except I hate relacing the damn things ... 
Chicken\ 
kabobs on the grill , spayed a wasp nest , felt a bit guilty watching the\

is wondering how < PROPMALE > fires get started when she can't even get Matchlight to burn ;-) 
just returned from a 5 mile walk with < PROPFEMALE > , we are both laying on the kitchen floor ;-) 
Missing < PROPMALE > because he is the only one who knows how to shut this ridiculous microwave beeping off . I heard it the first time ... the second and third time it is just irritating ! I don't need this much accountability from my small appliances ;-) 
What to do with leftover shrimp and a bottle of Muscadine wine ( part of the Kealy stash left behind ... ) add < PROPFEMALE > oil , garlic , fresh tomatoes and some angel hair pasta-yummy scampi ! ~ And my kids think they can cook ;-) 
My Starbucks iced coffee with soy , no classic & I are off to Bridlewood Estates to watch a horse show in < PROPFEMALE > blue sky 80 some low degrees . Sweet ! :-)

She's here , pj party time :-) 
Just looked a pictures taken last night of 9 beautiful young women celebrating life , friendship , and the wedding next month of a treasured friend . And I smiled imagining their evening together :-) 
I sat by the lake and looked at the sky , and as I looked , a fly went by ... followed by < PROPFEMALE > . Actually , I'm in the house . This is too funny , he just chased a fly up the back stairs . This dog is bug obsessive ;-) 
is fiery things-my mouth & this Bloody < PROPFIRST > and the grill-I actually made a fire ! It must be synergy ... Yeah !

is working on her new blog entry , it involves lavender & chamomile in the form of a bath bomb , candles , bourbon neat , and paint ;-) <3 PDH ! Details soon :-) 
made a kick @ss pot of spaghetti , Kopi is beak first in a bowl of it , and < PROPFEMALE > is sitting next to me wondering why he always gets left out on the good eats ;-) 
there are times when I miss having a man around the house ... like right now when my garbage disposal has copped an attitude with me ... I'm going to give it one right back-it ate one of my favorite painting tools ;-) 
Fred-my hero-took out my garbage disposal and beat it senseless until it coughed up the piece it ate ;-) All restored ! 
Just downloaded Netflix to her computer . Those that truly know me will now exclaim , \No way ! \ " ;-) " 
Where is my painting < PROPMALE > ... 
Alea iacta est 
No code in this status kids-off for the mamo and wearing a pink shirt ... actually .... the same shirt in my profile picture now that I look at it . Funny :-) Have a wonderful day all ! 
Thinks it's a small world when your mammographer < PROPFIRST > Frankson is one of your FB friends :-) Also , it does not appear that mammographer is actually a word , and it should be . Good to see you again < PROPFEMALE > ! Happy for you and little guy ( big guy too ) :-) 
And the < PROPFEMALE > made salad ; perfectly ripe avacado , red onion , yummy bits of feta in < PROPFEMALE > oil goodness called Apetina , tomato & carrot , tucked into a bed of < PROPFEMALE > . On top , she sprinkled a dash of dill ... and somewhere in distant reaches of her realm , the little < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > ss shuddered :-) 
What is the difference in a two year old male doberman and a toddler at the Mommy stage ? ... nothing ;-) 
Daring my son < PROPMALE > Osborough to post one word about the missing sweaters ... 
Has a wine date < PROPFEMALE > Perkins in the near future . Looking forward to you my long time friend :-) 
< PROPFEMALE > & I just did the walk around Oak Lake park twice-about 4 < PROPMALE > . He is now the perfect dog :-) Love a tired < PROPFEMALE > , he's the best !

Working off breakfast ... what a great group of guys and man can they cook ! Invited me back for steaks tonight but I have a standing date on Sunday nights :-) 
A year ago around this time I set a course for what I thought was going to be my new life . I anticipated decorating my new nest for the holidays and enjoying the peace I knew I would find there . Today I am saying goodbye to that life and beginning another . Its been a year of discovery and I am blessed by the depth of my friendships . More later <3 
Has set a personal goal to get from Harbour View to Greenbrier in 4 hours tonight 
toasting life with Peppermint Mocha Kahlua , Cheers & I'm making an obscene gesture at this night ;-) 
I am discovering that each time I pack up my life , there is less of it I need or want ;-) 
Two Men & A Truck , hmpf ... how about just < PROPFEMALE > & a SUV :-) Load one on the truck , load 2.5 in the staging area . Here we go ! 
I'm not interested in preserving the status quo ; I want to overthrow it . \

A full day painting-Sherwin < PROPMALE > Rainwashed , the color of choice at the new , new nest . Thanks < PROPFIRST > Reiter Smith for helping < PROPMALE > & I get so much done today ! If anyone is looking to have something professionally framed ( not talking Michaels 50% off coupon crap here ) my girl < PROPFIRST > Smith is All About the Frame-she does AWESOME work :-) 
Is in her new place , exhausted ! I have to return to Sommerton , evidently I took out a street sign driving that 26 ' U-Haul ... I knew that damn thing was too big ;-) 
Just realized she has 4 days to train < PROPFEMALE > to wear reindeer antlers for a Christmas parade ... I'm letting him watch the Grinch to get the general idea :-) 
It is kinda dark on my end of the block ... so , I am happy to discover this evening , the festive glow of every possible blow up Christmas contraption ever sold by Walmart and BJ's lighting my way home . Such a nice house too , who knew the Tacky's lived there ... 
Made breakfast for the first time in the BAH ( BigAssHouse ) not to be mistaken with the Nes t-t hat would be SAH ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Homes ) I'm getting settled in and am learning home improvement stuff ... like if you replace that little < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > battery in the garage door opener , it saves a lot of steps pulling your vehicle into the garage ;-) 
Oh Peppermint Mocha Kahlua you yummy goodness straight up in my glass :-) 
After spending the last ten years in sales management , I wrote my first contract today since , oh 2000 or so , and I am pretty damn excited about it :-)

Cat Vines is coming over to play . Wait till she finds out we have to fix the Christmas Tree :-)

Off for LEDS ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > had the BEST lights on her beautiful tree last evening and PDH this is not coveting , this is a creative sisterhood thing <3 
I just fixed my garbage disposal < PROPMALE > Ainslie just like the master told me how :-) I'm going to start a home improvement business at this rate ;-) 
Holiday shopping from my computer , convenient . The value of not being anywhere near a mall full of people putzing around a parking lot looking for the closest parking space , priceless ;-) 
It's 23 degrees outside and I , in my layers , got on a bike and made < PROPFEMALE > trot beside me while we toured the neighborhood and looked at Christmas lights . Anything to wear his ass out and leave mine alone ;-) My brain is frozen . 
Be safe 757 kids heading home for the holidays <3 
< PROPMALE > Ainslie BOOYAH ! Gotta love Apple products , you were right , plug in and play on my wireless network :-)

Big WHOOT to < PROPMALE > Osborough for his 3.5 GPA this semester and making the < PROPFIRST>'s List . Proud I am . Smart kid :-) Off to pick up his sister ! 
Kealy & I are layering up and braving the crisp , cold ass evening to take < PROPFEMALE > for a walk ;-) 
Here we snow again :-) 
I am predicting Kealy is going to be home with her Mama an extra day or so :-) 
Kealy , < PROPFEMALE > & I are heading out for a walk in the blizzard . I'm tying a rope around them to drag them back to safety-just in case :-) 
Its official , we just found out Kealy's flight was canceled . She has been rescheduled for Tuesday at 5:30 PM . And while common sense said she wasn't going anywhere , the flight status remained , \On Time\ " according to < PROPFEMALE > and the airport websites . Ridiculous ! I am sure there were people trying to get to the airport based on this information . " 
< PROPMALE > Croke < PROPMALE > Thank you Mr. < PROPMALE > for introducing me to Plyometrics ... Just did the P90X version . Please excuse me , I am going to throw up now ;-)

Oh I am excited now , Bring it < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > :-) tomorrow is Yoga day-care to join me ? ;-) 
What a great real estate day I had today :-) I am starting off the new year with lots of irons in this fire . Thanks to all my friends for their continued support ! You all are the VERY BEST ! <3 
I'm thinking if one is committed enough to push through one hour and 15 mins of P90X on a Friday night , that commitment should be capped off with bourbon and diet coke ;-) Now that is bringing it ! 
My Creative Commitment : I promise to send something handmade to the first 5 people who leave a comment here . They must in turn post this on their wall and send something they make to the first 5 people who comment on their status . The rules are that it must be handmade by you and it must be sent to your 5 people sometime in 2011 . Grabbed this from < PROPFEMALE > Creamer's earlier post-love it :-) 
Tonight in Ham Town , the gift of so many stars in the sky-I think I see every constellation ... I just don't know what they are :-)

Proud of you girls-and I promise not to muck things up too bad ... Joan < PROPFEMALE > Revell < PROPFEMALE > Giuliano 
Dawning of the age of once a < PROPFIRST > , always a < PROPFIRST > . And according to the new guidelines I am still a < PROPFIRST > . Of course I knew that but I am very relieved to find out I don't need to have an astrological sign crisis this evening . Bet the psychics are in a bit of a meltdown though ;-) 
Interestingly enough , the coffee pot makes the exact same hissing & snorting noises without water in the reservoir ... so imagine my puzzlement when I went to pour a cup . And so Friday begins :-) 
is creating , hands in . Busy , busy :-) 
Off to meet my favorite real estate appraiser . Haven't seen < PROPMALE > Levy in 11 years :-) 
Dobe gang-Brad and I are confused on the cheek swab test this morning . We get the swab the cheek part , are we supposed to do it twice ? 
Anyone else noticing ever since the whole astrological sign mishap that they are surrounded by people confused about their identities ;-) 
< PROPFEMALE > Deen Breakfast Casserole & I are heading to a meeting with my support staff . Hahaha-and they are <3 
Tonight , in Ham Town , my favorite home improvement couple , < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > will be spending the evening with me . In vino veritas :-) 
I shall risk the onslaught from all of my FB friends who are enjoying this bitter weather ( all 3 of them , including my son ) and say , give me an 87 degree day ( no humidity ) slight breeze off of the ocean , big yellow ball of a sun-hanging in a just too impossibly blue sky .... yeah I'm there . Screw winter , I'm over it :-) 
< PROPFEMALE > just came in with snow on him ;-) 
Guess who is heading the vet for a wing clip ;-) 
Cool Factor ! Our home buyer for the Bridlewood Ranch is in the AF stationed in Japan . < PROPFIRST > Horton ( Mr. P90X is currently over there doing a program with the troops ) He will be getting an F-15 flight with our customer's squadron . He said he will tell them to add a few extra G's & make him sore , just for me :-) Made me laugh ! 
Just OD'd on a totally green salad : < PROPFEMALE > , Broccoli , Avocado & Green Apples . I think I covered every shade of green . Now I am really wanting something brown ... like chocolate ;-) 
It's week 4 of PAIN90X , \Recovery Week\ " My idea of recovery is a couch slouch while holding a glass of wine ... this is still looking like exercise to me ;-) " 
Just spent 90 mins doing P90X Yoga , and am now in touch with my inner Gumby ;-) 
What's on my mind ? Peppermint Mocha Kahlua , on my mind and my tongue . Tonight , I toast you P90X ;-) 
Dobe Club meeting at my place in Ham Town tomorrow night . Need a quick , but delish-dish to serve . Where is my Foodie < PROPFIRST > ? ;-) 
< PROPFEMALE > Crossley Kreutter Remember our conversation earlier today , and me looking for wood ;-) I am putting up hex signs to < PROPMALE > it off-no time to join the ill masses around this town ! 
Received this text today from a former friend : \You know as you get up there you need to be in line with other old people getting flu shots . \ " Biteme Littlejohn ;-) " 
I love young women-Don't go there ;-) Dynamic , creative , energetic young women < PROPFEMALE > Diehl & < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Iuliano and if I felt better , I'd be doing a happy dance :-) 
Oh sweet progress , thank you-thank you , meds . Looking forward to not spending this day on my back . 
Learning to use chopsticks is a bit like riding a bike for the first time , once you get the < PROPFEMALE > of it , you are afraid to stop because you are just not sure you can get started again ;-) 
Wondering why my son has me watching a show about a woman who eats Comet Cleanser . I have my own trauma from Comet as a child ... my mother made me clean the bathrooms with it , every Thursday of my life . Now I cannot clean a bathroom on a Thursday ... and I don't buy Comet ;-) 
Just spent a delightful evening with the Farrar family at Vintage Tavern . Great food , wine , and the most enjoyable kind of company :-) < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Farrar 
Taking < PROPFEMALE > to the park , run dog , just run . And when we get home , I don't want to hear that incessant , slurping sound of chewing on a rubber ball ;-) 
remains challenged and fascinated with the eating with sticks process :-) 
Silke Satzinger < PROPMALE > Peck Why , oh why , is my dog now eating dirt clods ?! 
thinks that the hardest part of being a parent is loving them enough to let them go . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > what the heck is SMH ? I so do hate not being hip :-) 
is tremendously excited on several levels , but one most in particular :-) 
Off to Summer Park to meet with a customer of < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE>'s who has a condo to sell at the beach , then heading to the gym to work out with my favorite PT and BF ... hahaha , I sound 12 :-) 
is committed to a paint color , no turning back now :-) 
My kids , my world <3 
So my daughter informed me that we are going for Margaritas this weekend with < PROPMALE > . This is weird to me because the last time I was around < PROPMALE > ( say the last 20+ years ) he was not old enough to drink . He hasn't even been old enough to be the DD that damn long ... both my kids home this weekend , what a treat :-) 
Kealy is back in the 757 ! Thanks so much to everyone for their support these past 24 hours and helping her keep her spirits during her drive back home . I am never amazed by the power of friends , but she certainly was :-) \ 
<3 to all 
Best feeling ever , both of my kids are home :-) And the blessings keep coming <3 
Kealy has me watching this stupid ass Bachelor show . Seriously , reality shows are just unreal to me ;-) 
Local flavor tonight at the Thunderbird Grille in Ham Town with < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > , Kealy & Kip-can't judge these local dives by their exteriors . Great time :-) 
Tonight a 2004 Peju Province Estate Bottled Merlot , Napa Valley-Yum !

Came home and cut the grass , Kealy made dinner . We make such a great couple <3 
My $5 bottle of wine review , Trader < PROPFIRST>'s Coastal Zin . I'd pay $12.99 for this bottle of wine :-) 
Life changing happy :-) <3
