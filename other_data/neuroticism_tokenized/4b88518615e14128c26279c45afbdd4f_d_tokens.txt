Happy New Year Everyone ! Hope this year is better than last year 

God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ; courage to change the things I can ; and wisdom to know the difference . 
Sometimes I wish I was a little girl because bruised knees heal faster than broken hearts 
I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go . Things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right . You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE >

I am so stuck I cant even find my car and if I found it , it would take me forever to dig it out OMG ! 
\I am not afraid of tomorrow 
Wow work screwed me 2 days off in a row for the price of working 7 days straight . A quick reminder how important an education really is in order to live even a comfortable life . So Boys and Girls get that education ! I best take my own advice and get moving on it ! 
Thanks everyone for all the Happy B-Days !
