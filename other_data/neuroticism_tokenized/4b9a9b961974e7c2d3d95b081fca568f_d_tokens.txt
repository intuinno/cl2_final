#74 Someone that honestly I should probably make an effort to see more often . Hilarious and down for whateva . 
#83 A person that is one of 3 people that I know that may be crazier than me . Been gone too damn long glad to see you back . Someone once said that in life you only will have 5 virtuous friends , although I feel that I actually have quite a few more I count you as one of them 
#6 ... What more can I say that I haven't said already . I don't regret many things but I regret not communicating my wants , needs , how much I appreciate you and that I didn't stress to you that I am an asshole during the holidays .
