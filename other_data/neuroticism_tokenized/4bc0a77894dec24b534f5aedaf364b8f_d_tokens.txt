So you think that FB being blocked in < PROPFEMALE > is no big deal ? Our son , < PROPMALE > , just arrived there yesterday for a golf tournament and discovered the blockage first hand . Guess he hadn't been keeping up because he was surprised . So much for keeping his friends , family , and golfing buddies up-to-date with how it's going . He has resorted to ancient email technology . At least that gets through ! 
Happy Birthday B ! Of course I'll tell you myself when you wake up too < smile >
