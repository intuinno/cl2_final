< PROPFIRST > just stood on the top of some mountain , borrowed someone else's battery , and called me while away on his 8 day tour just to say hi :) <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 Isn't he fabulous :) 
boooo 
Life is too short to not appreciate the time that we have with the people that we love . Don't stay upset , don't hold grudges , don't take them for granted because what it comes down to is that you're going to love each other no matter what , anger and resentment will never be worth it ... cause what would you do if they suddenly weren't there ? Something I've always known but my dad made real . 
The fact that I'm STILL awake is really ridiculous ... goodnight ( actually good morning ) world it's 4:19 am and I'm tired 
Don't let anyone or anything get you down . 
Sadness is almost never anything but a form of fatigue 
Ever not been able to figure out why you're in the mood you're in ?.. 
HAPPY TURKEY DAY TO YOU !!!! I'm grateful for my life and my health and so thankful that I have my family and friends to share it with . You all are fabulous and I love each and every one of you :) 
Love life and it'll love you back <3 
I <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 being in <3 <3 <3 
is super missing her other half right now 
I guess , at the moment I am a bit jaded : tired , bored , or lacking enthusiasm , typically after having too much of something 
I <3 <3 <3 being in <3 <3 <3 , but sometimes it hurts . The more you love someone the more vulnerable you are . And when you're far away ... it's hard to resolve . 
Today is going to be a good one :) 
hanging with my lovies :) ... wish I wasn't so busy all the time so I could be here more often 
whooo feel accomplished :D very good 
Rough day at work , and I know tomorrow will be the same . So right now in my in between time I'm going to do NOTHING ! 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS :))))) ...... does anyone know if gas stations are open today ? 
I'm so glad I got to spend more quality time than expected with my beyond gorgeous family this Christmas season <3 
Ever been super tired but not allowed to go to sleep ... welcome to my next 3 weeks . I need more hours in my day ... 
My dad just saved my life with this goulash he just handed me haha ... just got home from work and STARVING ! 
Worked today ... now it's time for nap , gym , homework .

I need to find a way to fast forward to friday 4pm ...

A perfect lazy sunday with amazing friends ... ending with soup and crackers and a couple games of online pool with mr. <3 of my life ... 
ruin is the road to transformation

Life is < PROPMALE > <3 
A part of me is saying go to the gym ! and another part is saying naaaahhh ... 
What do you eat when nothing sounds appetizing or takes too much effort to make .... 
Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world . Indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . 
Oh the joys of piano <3 
Dear Mr. my one and only ... you're the < PROPFEMALE > I put in my oatmeal , the blueberries I add to my yogurt , the lemon I squeeze on my chicken ... you are my everything , my favorite thing , you make all that is my life better and go down easier . I love you I love you I love you and miss you . 
Oh you WOULD like to know what's on my mind wouldn't you !... 
Today a guy in the wet sauna at the gym shared his favorite < PROPFEMALE > proverb .... be happy in life , for you'll be a long time dead . 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Locke 
Dear Piano , thanks for listening ... 
I can't count how many times AAA has saved my day !... I should stop trying to see just how far I can get when my tank is on E 
omg I BEGGGGG myself to let myself fall asleep ... \ 
\ 
Anyways , came across a quote in my minibook that I write random shizznit in ... no person , place , or thing can give you happiness ... they may give you a cause for happiness or a feeling of contentment , but the joy of living comes from within . 
I'ma goin to the gym :) 
YES ! I found my bank card :) 
gym tiiiime :D 
Glad I drove the wrong way home for 30 minutes and ended up lost in the middle of oakland at midnight ! NOT okay
