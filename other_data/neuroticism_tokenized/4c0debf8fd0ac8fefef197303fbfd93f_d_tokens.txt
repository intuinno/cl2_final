I want to play volleyball . 

I kinda wish I had a smoothie 
The trick is to want to do something , but be way to lazy to actually do it . 
I think I'm in love . ( sigh ) 
I'm kind of sleepy . 
( sigh ) I wish < PROPMALE > year would start already . Summer is so boring ! 
Learning how to play Hey Soul Sister on my uke . 
It's funny how I know all these songs on mah uke but I only know the names of half of them . 
I wanna learn how to play somewhere over the rainbow . 
I am so bored right now . 
Today is one of those days where I wish I could just disappear from the world .

If you believe in Jesus Christ , put this on your wall . Don't ignore this because The Bible says : if you deny him , he will deny you in front of his father in the Gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not ashamed of it , copy this and put it on your wall . 
The bathroom has new tile !!!!! 
Has found out that she has an INTP personality . =^,^=
