< PROPMALE > Potter tonight !! 1111111 ! 11 ! 1 !!

Advanced to the in-person interview stage for a job ! Woohoo ! 
saw Black Swan again tonight . Still amazing , yet unbelievably fucked up . 
should probably clean her room ... 
Losing games of tetris is so demoralizing . 
The extent of my productivity today was walking to the gym , then realizing that working out was one of the last things I felt like doing at the moment , then turning around and walking home . 
IT 130 is such a pleasant and soothing class :) 
Needs to stop procrastinating D: 
did laundry , went to the gym for an HOUR ( yeah , that's right ) , almost cleaned her room , and had some nice life revelations . Super productive day , yo ! 
Everyone on facebook talking about tattoos makes me really want to get another one . 
It's cold .

Cynic is such a freaking awesome band . 
I drink too much diet coke . 
Is finding it impossible to come up with a reasonable schedule for next quarter . SIGHHH double < PROPMALE > .

just ate a cupcake for breakfast . I REGRET NOTHING . 
needs to stop eating pistachios and start doing her homework . 
Gettin mah hair did today :) 
is getting all nostalgic reading old xanga entries . 
' s hair is currently generating enough static electricity to supply power to the entire city of Chicago . 
DePaul cancelled class ?? What is this I don`t even . 
The word \snowpocalypse\ " sounds like a dinosaur . " 
DePaul closed tomorrow too ???!! 
Watching the U-Haul people attempt to shovel their parking lot is super sad/entertaining . 
is all caught up with Pretty Little Liars . Now I need a new show equally as stupid/addicting to keep me entertained through the rest of the snowpocalypse . 
just spent about an hour and a half skyping < PROPFIRST > Schroer while playing tetris . Yeah , I'm cool . 
Person living above me dribbling a basketball nonstop , I might kill you . 
Apparently the Super Bowl's today . 
All registered for classes ! Next quarter is going to be rather hell-ish . 
So many tone rows . 
There is nothing on the planet that beats a McDonald`s breakfast . 
I wish I was a synesthete . 
Dear Kelly , \ 
Get off facebook and do your homework . Seriously . 
Off to bomb yet ANOTHER aural training performance exam . 
SHAMROCK SHAKE !

Happy Excuse-to-Eat-a-Shit-Ton-of-Chocolate Day , everyone ! :) 
I'm in a very \I love life\ " mood right now :) " 
< PROPFIRST > Cage's Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano are kinda nifty . 
It never ceases to amaze me how much awesome and truly innovative music there is out there . 
Spongebob is on netflix watch instantly . My day has been made . 
No matter how hard I try , I can't seem to be able to keep less than 25 tabs open on my browser at a time . 
Electricity , come backkkkkkkkk :( 
1237 , I am livid . 
I can't believe I'm about to write a paper that includes both Twilight and Pretty Little Liars . 
Toddlers in Tiaras is a fascinating show . 
Oh yikes . 
It's so nice to be reunited with Reese Puffs :) Nomnomnom 
Yikes , the idea that I might be able to graduate in four years may have been a bit foolishly optimistic D: 
Rainforest Cafe is the best place EVER . 
Chicago winter , why must you hate on my boots ? 
My brain is not working right now . 
No , obnoxious sales person paid to stand on street corners and harass people , you may not ask me a question about my hair . 
You really can't get any more emo than Shostakovich . 
It's CAFFEINE TIME ! 
Today has enormous potential to be an epic fail . 
is seeing < PROPFIRST > Schroer , < PROPFEMALE > Ludwig Schroer , and < PROPFIRST > Schroer this weekend . SCHROER FAMILY INVASION ! 
Ohmygod 
had a splendid weekend :) 
Oh SCORE no group piano today ! 
SOME people * cough*Kim SchroerandJeanne Ludwig Schroer*cough * really need to stop leaving their uber important items in Chicago for me to retrieve when they visit . 
There is a high probability that I will fall asleep in LSP 200 today . 
I really need a Teen Mom night tonight . 
Chips and salsa for breakfast ? Hell yes . 
The new Human Abstract CD = <3 
Why does facebook keep eating my statuses/notifications ? 
Never wearing heels again . Ouch and a half . 
St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day parade today ! 
Just completed a horrendously awful final paper for LSP 200 . At least that class is over . 
Why are Sundays always such an epic fail ? 
Ahhh it's over ! Last Teen Mom night of the quarter tonight , then moseying on home tomorrow :) 
Fuckkk the megabus . 
has the most adorable cats on the planet . 
Whyyyyy am I awake ? 
tumblr is so freaking addicting . 
Chipotle should deliver . 
can't believe classes start again tomorrow . :o 
It's good to be back in Chicago :) 
In spite of the fact that I am up entirely far too early to begin my SIXTH quarter of group piano ( gahhsaudugy ) , I am choosing to start this quarter off on a note of cheery optimism :) 
Goodbye , youth 
Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > Boulos for pointing out that at least I will officially no longer be able to be featured on Teen Mom . 
Protip : Don't eat nachos from 7-eleven , no matter how good of an idea it might seem to you at the time .
