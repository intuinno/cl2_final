one day left . missing galway's [ MY IDOL'S ] performance . T_T 
i can't wait to be in nyc and not have to deal with stupid band crap anymore . 
maybe they don't realize that i have one quarter of the hardest job .. and if they don't like the way i do it , they can take over and see if they can handle it . 
and so what if they talk about me while i'm not there . that just goes to show how immature they always are . they don't know the real story of why i did those things . and maybe i screwed up once for taking a nice break under the tent , but i'm not perfect and neither is anyone else . we make mistakes and they shouldn't be breathing down my neck about it . 
at first it was all \congratulations\ " and now it's all \ " we hate you . \""

Angel Olivero's pasta party was the best i've ever been to , out of all four years of swim .

midterms suck so much . what's the point of them ? honestly . they're just making my crappy mood even worse . 
still in a bad mood . >_< buttttt , must practice for all-state ! i think i'm going to do a bit of the solo and a bit of the scales , and then sight read for like , two hours . :D

OH MY GOD . I MADE ALL STATE . I . MADE . ALL . STATE ! YESSSSSSSS ! 
i'm so sorry . D ' : 
now i can't even be happy about all state , because i screwed things up so badly ..

27 dresses , Lie to Me , rebroadcast of Shout It Out ! Hanson's new album at midnight tonightttt <3 // [ http://www.formspring.me/fullahhhh ] 
love hanson so much <3 new album after school !! // [ http://www.formspring.me/fullahhhh ] 
I think the world is laughing at me . I wanted Hanson's new album in my hands today , the day it came out . Yet the stores around here that are supposed to sell it ( i.e. FYE , WalMart ) don't sell it in stores . I have to buy it online , apparently . This SUCKS . 
I used up valuable gas to go out and find the new Hanson album . None of the stores I went to had it . Why doesn't the world want me to have this CD ? 
too mad about not getting Hanson's new album to care about the athletic dinner thing . you won't see a smile on my face if you're going . // [ http://www.formspring.me/fullahhhh ] 
resorting to listening to the new Hanson album on their Myspace because it looks like I won't be getting it any time soon . I'm so mad , you have no idea . I want it NOW . 
worst day in a while ? yeah . 
it's only wednesday . why is this week going so slow ? 
i have no words . // [ http://www.formspring.me/fullahhhh ] 
NHS Swimming DVDs are ready . Anyone who ordered one or who would like to order one , bring $12 dollars tomorrow in order to receive a DVD . I have 7 made up for people who ordered them , I have a set of 50 DVDs so if you want one , let me know . 
I love how every person in the Lopez Tonight audience got a copy of Hanson's new album . Some of them probably don't even know who Hanson is , or like them . And I still don't have one . A person who has loved them since I was five years old . How is that fair ? 
apparently people purposely get me upset/angry just so they can have a good laugh . i've decided i really don't like people like that . 
last full day of high school ever tomorrow . this is crazy . // [ http://www.formspring.me/fullahhhh ] 
I should have duct tape on me at all times . 
I realized I have something to look forward to in the immediate future . I'm playing a duet with my favorite teacher in the world tomorrow <3

wind ensemble seemed to last forever today .. it might be because I feel weirdly more tired than usual , and I got plenty of sleep last night . good day , nonetheless . :]

I've decided that the winter Wind Ensemble concert is going to be utterly amazing .

Q : What ensembles do you play in at school ? \ 
A : This semester I'm in marching band and wind ensemble . Next semester ... well , next semester depends on how my audition goes . I could either be in Concert Band or Orchestra .. So . Next semester = no marching band , wind ensemble , and concert band/orchestra . 
Q : Do consider me a friend ? What is your favorite memory of us together ? \ 
A : Of course I consider you a friend ! Favorite memory .. hmmm . We've had a lot of fun moments :] Probably your first year of flute camp , when we first met . I heard you playing and started freaking out because I was so excited we had someone of an awesome caliber there , and you had this look on your face like you thought I was crazy . :D 
I unfortunately have a research paper to finish tonight . 
is on a research paper roll . 
Q : What is your guilty pleasure ? \ 
A : Hmm .. I guess any drama show on ABC Family . Secret Life , Make It or Break It , Greek , you name it . It can be pretty embarrassing to admit I watch some of those shows . 
I bet you I could go to London and fit in . 
is quite proud of her finished research paper ... still has theory to do , and is hungry . oh , and the cstore closes in three minutes . awesome .

A Very Potter Musical , where have you been all my life ? 
most . intense . movie . EVER . 
I'm just realizing why I recognized Scrimgeour's voice in part 1 ... it's because it's Davy Jones ' voice from Pirates of the Caribbean . I'm going to go check imdb.com so find out if I'm right ..

is on a search for the perfect recital dress .. 
had to do it . Vulpix is adorable . 
mock audition went quite well ... I think I've definitely improved since my first ensemble audition at the beginning of the fall semester . 
I still don't really know what I want for a recital dress . Short , long , sparkly , plain , strapless or not , belted or not ... 
three classes , a jury rehearsal , and four hours of practicing , and then it's the weekend . :] 
in the middle of my attempt to leave videos on most of my friends ' pages , my camera decided to \not be found . \ " awesomesauce . "

801 : I miss you !! I miss seeing your lovely face and hearing your awesome accent up at Jesus camp . You always had the best stories to tell me . :] 
004 : I realize I don't know you as well as I should . From what I do know about you , you seem like a really great girl ! You always seem to have a smile on your face or are laughing about something . I really hope we'll be able to < PROPFEMALE > out a lot more during second semester ! :]

the WIU Symphony Orchestra did amazing last night . props to < PROPFEMALE > Sanders and DaMar Hampton for incredible L'Arlesienne suites ! 
great job last night , steel band !! writing my FYE paper , theory study party in thompson with everyone , then more writing and practicing for juries tomorrow . yikes ! 
I'm so sick of my neighbors . Every day since I've been here , they have their TV or their music up so loud that I can hear it through the walls . Not only that , but I can hear everything they say through the walls . I go to my RA , and I complain at the front desk , and they still don't get it . It's even 24 hour quiet this week , and I can hear everything going on over there . What is it going to take ? 
so this study party was kind of an epic fail , but it was still fun :] < PROPFEMALE > Melcher < PROPFEMALE > Stieghorst < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Mejia 
have to somehow scrounge together this FYE paper today , take my FYE final , anddddd beast my jury ... yikes ? 
I think I should reward myself with a little Facebook time .. I have four < PROPFEMALE > s of my five < PROPFEMALE > paper done .. and I still have two hours left to finish it . Jury at 4 ... wish me luck ! 
paper , done . jury , done . I never seem to sound as good as I can when I'm nervous .. but I guess that's only to be expected ? 
only three days til Jersey <3 
just have to get through my english final and then my piano final tomorrow , and then I'm set to go back to Jersey <3 
anyone want to live in grote with me next semester ? 
are you KIDDING me , neighbors ? 24 hour quiet hours , and you're practicing your saxophone in your room ? are you freaking kidding me ?! 
is in the midst of trying to shove everything possible in my suitcase ... 
I believe coming to Western was the best decision I ever made in my life . 
at this moment , I'm on the plane heading to Newark :] it's pretty cool to be online at 39.000 feet . 
oh hey Jersey , I see you didn't get any snow ... :D 
hopes to find her own < PROPFIRST > Dawson someday . 
cumulative gpa ... 3.82 :] woo ! 
is excited for eggnog tonight . 
what can I do with $85 in iTunes when the list of music I want is at school ? :] 
just woke up from the worst nightmare ever : I forgot about my recital so I showed up late and forgot to dress up , EVERYONE was backstage thinking I was giving just a half recital and that concert band was taking the second half of the time , and to top it all off , my accompanist did not show up . scariest dream ever . 
so the principal flutist of the Boston Pops Orchestra is a girl from New Jersey . looks like there's a pattern forming here . .. :D 
misses < PROPFIRST > Owens , < PROPFEMALE > Stieghorst , < PROPFIRST > Ruberg , < PROPFIRST > Kraemer , Zachtopher Friant , < PROPFEMALE > Simmons ... 
gonna bring in the new year with my best friend in the world , < PROPFEMALE > Shulman . 
who knew ... that I would actually enjoy the < PROPFEMALE > Gomez album . 
anyone know where I can get a cheap , small TV around Macomb ? how about a DVD player ? 
STARS used to work on my laptop . Now it doesn't . What gives ? 
performing one of my pieces for my recital at open mic tonight . hopefully it goes well .. 
thought my performance went quite well tonight :] 
oh no .. auditions are on Monday at 12:30 CT for flutes ... and my flight doesn't leave Newark until 12 ET the same day . how could this have happened ? 
I'd prefer not to be a Gemini , stupid new zodiac system .. 
Film composer Alexandre Desplat is a flutist <3 // AND not to mention , his New < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt . 1 scores are kickass . 
a day full of packing , practicing audition excerpts , watching movies with mom , and cooking ! :] 
made Lemon Chicken < PROPMALE > for my parents .. and the chicken came out well . the < PROPMALE > sauce .. not so much . ah well , I tried ! :] 
last night in Jersey until May . :[ 
heading for Macomb . be back around 6:30 ish ! :] 
got invited to join the Honors College // figured bass , I despise you . 
Finally , after four and a half consecutive months , I got my Juno DVD back from DaMar Hampton . :P 
What the heck will it take to get my neighbors to shut ! up ! 
is kind of addicted to the Welch's strawberry soda they sell in the c-store ... 
It's Return of the Loud Neighbors . I hate sequels . 
is following < PROPFIRST > Owens's example and cleaning my room . 
wants to practice piano , badly . too bad Browne is off limits . 
went to a Lutheran service this morning . it was definitely different . 
never thought I'd miss home this much . 
I should not have to wear ear plugs to bed . 
This is one of those days where I wish I lived in a freshman dorm , so I could be hanging out with my friends right now ... ah well . Guess it's time to finish cleaning . 
really wants to go to the rec . it's probably completely covered in snow , though . 
is on a weird cleaning spree . I've completely rearranged my room , vacuumed , washed my dishes , done my laundry , and cleared out the trash . there's nothing left to clean . ahhhh ! 
My neighbors really just don't get it . Five noise complaints , many complaints to my RA , a talk with the CD , and asking them personally three times . Nothing will make them shut up . I'm sure of it . 
welp , guess I have to start on my homework now . I'll pop in my All-State recording to make it better :] 
got through the first half of the day with flyings colors , and in a great mood . now for the second half : lesson , studio , concert band . let's go !! :D 
Perhaps I should belt out some bassoon as loud as I possibly can in my room so my lovely neighbors get a taste of their own medicine . 
Okay , neighbors . You have exactly ONE hour to disband the party , or I'm calling the front desk . 
My dear , dear neighbors : Thank you for waking me up at 6am on the weekend . You guys are awesome . The awesomest . 
:O < PROPMALE > Fiennes is the voice of Ramses in The < PROPMALE > of Egypt ! Yay Voldemort :] 
Exactly one year ago today , I auditioned/was accepted into the School of Music here at Western Illinois University . <3 
I'd much rather practice than watch the Superbowl . Kcya ! 
horrible day . gunna watch The Runaways and then watch my favorite shows , and perhaps it'll get better . 
LOL my neighbors are watching Anchorman . I recognize the yazz flute solo . 
Has the 3rd movement of the Persichetti piece stuck in my head .. oh , concert band , you slay me . 
Alright Facebook , start listing some great flute solos you think I haven't played . Ready , go ! 
Ooooh , I'm really liking this Ferneyhough music ! Thanks < PROPFIRST > McMurtery ! :] 
Been looking at pictures from the beginning of the year .. things have changed so much since then . 
A perk of going to school in Illinois ? I get a day off for < PROPMALE>'s birthday . 
I'm not sure why I brought sunblock to school ... it's not like there's a beach around here . 
Bathroom is clean and now I'm watching my favorite movie in the whole world , August Rush . <3 
I could really go for a day at the Jersey shore <3 
As soon as the semester is over and I come home , < PROPFEMALE > Kwok , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , and Kaylla Cantilina , we MUST run over to Princeton . Pronto . 
Happy birthday best friend < PROPFEMALE > Shulman , wife < PROPFEMALE > Stieghorst , and my favorite actor < PROPFIRST > Highmore . :] 
Dear Heat Wave , \ 
I love you . \ 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! 
I've got my ear plugs in and I can still hear everything going on in my neighbors room . I'm so incredibly sick and tired of this . 
Awwww yeah , March of the Belgian Paratroopers makes a comeback ! 
Can someone explain why my parents paid $ 1,515 for my meal plan , but I only ever see $900some of that money on my ID when I first buy something from the caf ? 
fantastic mood :] now I just need to be at the beach to make it better ... :P 
I was so into my practicing tonight and I was playing so intensely that I think I must have locked my jaw .. and now it hurts . :[ But nevertheless , it was an awesome session ! :] 
Camerata was absolutely fantastic tonight ! LaMoine , props to you as well ! // When Dr. Huff articulates , it looks like he's munchin ' on his < PROPMALE > :] 
is so excited for the Hanson live stream at 8 , it's ridiculous . 
already in love with the song the boys are recording right now . 
hmm .. perhaps I should switch to music business so maybe one day I can record for Hanson . :] heh . 
What a fantastic stream . I wish the boys would do this sort of thing more often . <3 
Zac is singing the most beautiful song ever right now . #hanson live on http://www.livestream.com/hansonmusic 
my best friend , < PROPFEMALE > Shulman's Sweet 16 party is tonight . I desperately wish I could be there for it .

getting up early to go to the contemporary service at < PROPFIRST > UMC :] 
nothing like some Rally For One to make my night more awesome <3 
Hmm ... Memoirs of a Geisha or Spiderman ? 
Two awesome movies in a day : Remember the Titans at 2 , and August Rush at 4 . :] Then I'm gunna watch Spiderman since I got more votes for that than Memoirs of a Geisha . // Happy . <3 
Every time I watch Spiderman , it reminds me of senior year in marching band at NHS and the < PROPMALE > Elfman themed show . Good times . 
It's audition day ! :D Put on a smile ! Today is going to be an awesome day . 
been thinking about ASP lately , and how much I miss it . 
Today is going to be the awesomest day ever ! Nothing can bring me down :] 
My heart beats only for you . 
Of course it would be concert day and my lips are so chapped that I can't play correctly . AWESOMEEEEE . 
Just had one the of the greatest concerts ever . WIU Wind Ensemble , we rock ! :D 
Good job , WIU Concert Band . I conquered my chapped lips and defeated my solos ! Woot ! :] 
\It's like a never-ending chain of smiles . :] \ " \ 
absolutely fantastic service this morning , and an incredible night last night . :] 
did not sing nearly enough today . 
I'll have the sweetest dreams , just for you . 
Best Monday in a long time ? Yeah , I think so . :D 
11 days til Jersey <3 
Arranging pieces for a mallet ensemble is not easy . At all . 
I could definitely go for some spring break right now . Homework is piling up and getting on my nerves . Grr . :P 
I'm watching old YouTube videos of me , and I'm realizing just how much I've improved since last year . :] 
Mmm , rain <3 
There aren't enough words in the English language to describe how amazing the orchestra concert was tonight . 
Well , looks I'll have visited two states I haven't been to by the time spring break is over . 
Thank you Daddy , < PROPFIRST > Fuller , for getting my copy of Breaking < PROPFEMALE > signed by < PROPFIRST > Facinelli <3 
Had an awesome girl's night/Jane Austen movie night with < PROPFEMALE > McGowan , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stasicky , and < PROPFEMALE > Chien . :] 
Five more days . Just five more days , and then I'll be home . :] 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Carlstrom for writing me letters and coloring pictures for me to < PROPFEMALE > up at school :D

Stay with me . This is what I need , please . 
So ready to be out of here . Spring break , get here faster . 
One more day . Just one more day . Gotta keep telling myself that . One more day ...

I love < PROPMALE > Peck so much . :] 
Only 56 more days until I'm home again . Recital in two weeks , and my parents and < PROPMALE > Peck are coming to see me play :DDDDDD 
Today is a perfect day :] In the best mood .. nothing can bring me down ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Peck , you make my life so much better . I don't know how I've lived this long without you . I love you with all that I have and I'll never stop . <3

Dear Enterprise Rent-A-Car , you have officially ruined my night by giving my parents a jank car . Instead of arriving in about a half hour from now , they won't get here for another four . Thanks , thanks a lot . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Fuller , < PROPFIRST > Fuller , and < PROPMALE > Peck just left . Only six weeks .. yet it still feels so far away . I miss you already <3 
It's so hard to watch the three people you love most get in a car and drive away from you , knowing you won't see them again until the summer . 
Wind Ensemble Tour = Sleep ? What's that ? 
WE Tour - over . Great job everyone ! :] 
A Very Potter Musical makes any night a better night :] 
< PROPMALE > Peck's pastor talked about us in his sermon today . We must be special :] 
Is it May 15th yet ? 
If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world , who isn't perfect but is perfect for you , who works hard & would do anything for you , who makes you laugh & drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who takes care of you , who you want to grow old with , who you are thankful for everyday , & who you could not live without ... then brag about him a little & re-post . <3 < PROPMALE > Peck 
WAHHHH I wanna learn Italian . Really badly . 
I guess I owe ASP for all my happiness :] 
Having a lot of fun changing my embouchure and opening up my sound . There are so many colors I've never heard myself play before , this is great ! :D 
Next semester is going to SUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCK . 
Won't tell anybody how you turn my world around , won't tell anyone how your voice is my favorite sound . Baby , if I've got you , I don't need a parachute . You're gonna catch me if I fall down . <3 
Happy Easter ! He is risen indeed ! <3 
Dear A Very Potter Sequel , \

I love < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Fuller very , very much . Can't wait to see you when I get home . <3 
To the flute camp girls of 2009 ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Vandzura , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Healey , < PROPFEMALE > Stephens ): I just watched the DVD of our recital that year , and at the end of Air , we \bowed to the master\ " aka < PROPFIRST > and Esma . Remember that ? It made me smile . :] " 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > Shulman and < PROPMALE > Peck like no other . I cannot wait to go home . Finals week , get outta here . No one likes you .
