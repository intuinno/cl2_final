While you scream at your woman .. there's a man wishing he could talk softly in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her .. there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you hurt your woman .. there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman cry there's ... a man stealing smiles from her .

Please\ 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish\ 
is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a \ 
choice- people who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking \ 
for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . Will you make it your status for at \ 
least ... one hour ? Promote love and acceptance ! Not hate ! In honor of \ 
Purple Spirit Day ! 
Been staying up way too late the past couple of nights . Heading to bed . Goodnight all !
