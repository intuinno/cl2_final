< PROPFEMALE > was released from the hospital last night . They will be traveling back and forth for feedings . Little Lawson is still progressing . Please pray that the tube in is lung will come out VERY SOON because Aunt Sissy has to go back home this weekend and I'm going to be VERY heartbroken if I can't hold him before leaving . 
Yesterday was very difficult . Went to the NICU to see Lawson and they only allow parents and gparents back . They let me back to see him the other day & I tried again But they wouldn't let me . My heart was crushed ! I stood outside the window and cried as I watched the others get to hold his hand . 
Lawson is moving to a crib today !! They're going to let them hold him tonight . I'm cleaning the house today and finishing up his time capsule . 
Getting ready to go < PROPFEMALE > out with Lawson in the hospital . I'll finally get to hold my precious baby nephew !! He's coming home today around 5 :) I'm so excited !! 
I don't want to go home ! I rocked Lawson for a little over an hour last night after I gave him a bottle . I love this lil man ! He's such a good baby ! I'm gonna miss him sooooo much ! Dad and I are hitting the road around 10am . 
Just got home & I've already cried twice . Pups were happy to see me but still miss my lil Guy ! Also this was the hardest goodbye ever for me & sis ! :(
