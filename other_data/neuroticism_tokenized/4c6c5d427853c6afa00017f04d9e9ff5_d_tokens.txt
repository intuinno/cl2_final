I wonder what it would be like to be immortal , and what eternal porpose could you devote immortal life too ? \I know this is random but it is a really interesting thought to me \"" 

RANDOM QUESTION :O evil zombies from the grave has risen and are now feasting on your brain how does that make you feel ? 
I just joined the biggest teenage fail to ever hit the internet out of curiosity of what its talking about and it just selected a group of my friends and did something I have no idea what !!! 
had a dream that I was on a sunken submarine sort of thing that was filled with water except for a few rooms and was filled with zombie-like things and there was only one romm with a few survivors in it that had no water or zombie-things . does this sound wierd too you ? 
hitler had only one working testicle !!! random fact !!! :-) 
hey < PROPFIRST > I need a broddie helmet to do a task on band of heroes can u get it for me ? i have then money for it but it glitched up so ... ya i cant get it 
the horoscope on this website was 100% undeniably accurate !!! and I usually dont take them seriously just think of them as things that are fun . 
Zombies start populating the earth and start taking over the human race ... How do you survive !?!?!?!?! 
if someone granted you the ability to be immortal would you ? why or why not ? if you would what eternal porpose would you try to have ? 
what would be your personal hell ? in other words a world were every living nightmare of yours happened ? 
what would be your personal heaven ? in other words were every possible thing in the world was a dream come true ?

I\ 
might not be the most beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do I have the \ 
perfect body . I might not be the first choice , but I'm a great choice . I\ 
don't pretend to be someone I'm not because I'm just too good at being \ 
me . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in my past , but\ 
I'm proud of who I am today !! Take ... me as I am ... or watch me as I \ 
walk away . Post this as your status if you love being YOU :) 
part 1\ 
is peace achievable withing society , I just have put some extreme thinking to morality peace , and is it achievable ? n o-o ne ever seems to agree on right and wrong so I always thought that maybe a society thats open for everyone to make thier own choices but still enough restrictions where we can live with eachother 
I am better than everyone in the whole world ... and I am modest lol ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... just kidding 
theres a difference between 100% certainty and knowing 
I have a god dahm headache for no reason !!! sry random I kno thats the point !
