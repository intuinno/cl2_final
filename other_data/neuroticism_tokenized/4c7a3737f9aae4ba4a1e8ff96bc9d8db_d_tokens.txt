oh god taelor's going to meet my older brother < PROPFIRST > rags .... i rly hope he doesn't scare her away haha jk 
and ppl wonder why i don't trust anyone 
i may not be as sour and shortfused as i used to be , but ppl still keep breaking my trust so i guess there's always going to be something keeping me from trusting others . 
staying this calm around so much stupidity and aggression is fuckin hard as shit ... but im doin it , and i feel proud of myself for it 
quite content with life atm 
\'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight . I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks . I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers . And I'd like to check you for ticks . \ " ~ Brad Paisley "

it takes a skilled hand to catch a fish . Even more skill to catch a fishing pole . But it takes someone with extraordinary skills to catch a child's fishing pole connect to ( not equipped with ) your brothers 40 pound fishing line that he lost 2 months ago which , in turn , is connected to two other fishing lines , three sticks and took at least five to ten minutes to get the entire bundle of shit out of the water . 
holy shit im so nervous ... i actually get to deliver a car to one of our customers ... i rly hope i dont fuck this up ¿œ¿ ..... wish me luck you guys ! 
I always seem to make my best friends out of the strangest situations @_@ 
if everyone cared and nobody cried , if everyone loved and nobody lied , if everyone dared to swollow their pride , would we see the day that nobody died ?
