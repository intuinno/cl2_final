Starting my first day of Action's North American Conference ... we'll be focused on Social Media ... 

Starting Day 2 of our Social Media Workshop ... yesterday was chock full of great stuff , looking for more today ! 
Another new sports season for Dalton ... Lacrosse ... had the parents sign up dinner last night , and of course he couldn't be the only kid on the < PROPMALE > Lacrosse team wearing last years gloves ... 
Just got back from a great networking event at Bricktop's in Atlanta .... pretty eclectic group , made some fun AND useful connections ... what more can you ask for ? 
I am officially SO OVER cold weather and snow in Atlanta ! Where's Global Warming when you need it ? 
So the weather has FINALLY broken , and I'm hitting the trails this PM to do some training ! 
We had a great GrowthCLUB meeting yesterday with our clients ... Susan will post notes and pictures later ! I think doing workshops with clients is one of my favorite parts of being an Action coach ... 
OK , so I'm about to write a cliche ... I saw my older boy off to college after Spring Break this morning ... the next time he's home in May , I'll be taking him out for a beer ( his first legal one with me , at least ) ... the time does go by SO FAST ... but I'm really looking forward to this next phase of being his Dad ... 
Time to brag on the younger son ... the < PROPMALE > High School wrestling team voted him \Hardest Working\ " wrestler in a tie with the Senior captain of the team ... and he's gotten his second varsity letter as a wrestler ... that puts him up to 4 vs his goal of 11 by the time he graduates from < PROPMALE >..." 
I completed my second half marathon speed walk yesterday ... it was really fun until mile 10 ... today is NO FUN AT ALL ! A huge thanks to my personal trainer , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Without his help , I wouldn't have been able to complete the race . It did tell me that if I actually did some serious roadwork ( as opposed to doing almost none for this race ) I could do the full marathon ... 
Had a great afternoon of calling past clients and inviting them to < PROPMALE > Sugars \Business Is Booming\ " workshop on May 3rd at Cobb Galleria . More calls to come ...! " 
Just got back from Business Is Booming in Atlanta ... I think that we had 700 people in the room ... Brad Sugars did a great job of building on some established material in the context of what's new , and this phase of the business cycle ... great stuff as always , and a fun time connecting with new people and reconnecting with old friends ... 
So it's been not quite 24 hours since < PROPMALE > Sugars spoke in Atlanta , and I've had some time to remember the gift to business owners that coaching represents ... and how much I enjoy providing that gift ! 
Interesting article on business coaching from Consumer Buys ... http://smartconsumerbuys.com/business-coaching-performance-and-possible-benefits/ 
I've just loaded FB onto the Crackberry ... where will this go ? ;-) 
This came out of a discussion with my clients in our 90 Day Plan Session today ... \You need to get your business and goals out of your head and on paper because it forces you to eliminate complexity\ " ... from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > of SS Graffix ... Totally Brilliant ! " 
Two songs that set up most things that matter to me ... \ 
\Right Now\ " and \ " Dreams\ " by < PROPFIRST > Halen ... it's what it's ALL about ! What songs do it for you ? " 
Just finished a day of Soapbox Derby officiating in < PROPFEMALE > . Sometimes it just feels good to do something for other people ... helps your perspective . As always , it was a great opportunity to get to know some folks along the way ... and sorta made up for spending a day outside on what had to the first day of a < PROPFEMALE > heat wave weekend ! 
A great Father's Day ... it wasn't in doing things so much as talking with my sons throughout the day about different things and what's going on in their world's ... and then thinking about what I would do next to help them along in their journeys to adulthood ... 
So I just discovered how to get out of paying the copay at a Dr's office ( at least immediately ) ... hand the receptionist your credit card and arrange for her to drop it behind the formica backing holding her work area to the wall ! It has become impossible to even find , let alone retrieve ! \ 
Some things in life are just built to generate stress or laughter ... I'm choosing laughter on this one !!!! 
The dynamic between beliefs and values is a powerful one . Unaligned , not much happens ... aligned , amazing things happen effortlessly . Beliefs can change in an instant , but values tend to remain more constant ... so it's better to challenge beliefs than values to create the alignment . It can be a hard thing to do ... but it's where personal strength and success live ... 
The best part of what I do is that I get to talk with business owners about what's going on in their businesses , and provide them with a sense of hope that there is a way to get to where they want to be ... it's the best feeling in the world , and I\ve gotten to do that a couple of times in the last few days now ! " 
Having a GREAT time at the Center for Family Resources < PROPFEMALE > Bowling Tournament . Bowling , like Golf , is a great way for me to remember the virtues of Humility ! 
Just completed part one of our office move ... the old office is packed ... now for part two ... getting it there and unpacked ! 
So we're in the moving \Twilight Zone\ " ... the original movers who were going to get us to the new office NEVER SHOWED UP yesterday ... we have a new set that we're trying to get in now ... the new furniture did show up ... another opportunity to smile at life ... " 
Watching the UFC fights from Hooters in < PROPFEMALE > Hawkj , NC ... we're both thinking Lesnar in a tough contest over Carwin ... it's great to be able to do this with the oldest boy on vacation ... 
golf 
Golf at Hammers < PROPMALE > today ... I am so looking forwrad to it ! 
My older son , < PROPMALE > , has been interning for < PROPFIRST > Olens this summer , and he's gotten to do some pretty interesting stuff ... I just talked to him from the GA Tea Party meeting ... this is about as good as it gets for a Poli Sci < PROPMALE > ! 
Heads Up ... i-85 Northbound is bumper to bumper stopped at Sugarloaf / 316 
I'm sitting in Dr < PROPMALE > McCloud's office with my wife , < PROPFEMALE > . She broke her knee on Saturday ( and maybe some other stuff ) dismounting a horse . A big thanks to my business partner < PROPFEMALE > who is making sure that life goes on at ActionCoach < PROPMALE > Hall while I'm taking care of this . 
We got word back on < PROPFEMALE>'s knee ... she will be having surgery next Tuesday to have a pin installed to facilitate healing of the bone ... otherwise , it won't heal properly , if at all . \ 
\ 
It's great that we live in a time that this kind of thing can actually be done . It wasn't so long ago that she would have just been \lame\ " for the rest of her life . " 
2400 yards in the pool at LA Fitness today beats the hour race walking yesterday at noon that required 2 bottles of water and a ride home from a Good Samaritan who saw me passing out on the side of the road ! wha 
I'm checking < PROPFEMALE > into Northside for knee surgery . She's currently in the process of having what dignity she has taken away ... she's putting on her open backed hospital gown ... 
< PROPFEMALE > is out of surgery and in recovery ... will be spending the night here ... then about three months of therapy before she can walk unassisted ... the x-ray of her knee now looks like a Lego toy ... 
Just invested most of the afternoon working on some personal development ... makes my head hurt , but definately worth the investment of time ... now to work on some physical development with a Race Walk or a Swim ( depends on temp and humidity ... ) . 
Just started the day with an hour of Race Walking hills ... thank goodness it isn't as humid as last week ! 
Something new for our Marketing Workshop tomorrow ... my partner , < PROPFEMALE > Hooper , will be \attending\ " as a \ " talking head\ " via Skype and a webcam from Houston ... this will be fun if nothing else ! " 
A fun day so far ... 90 minutes of Race Walking on the Hill Course to start the day , and 90 minutes of Bikram Yoga in < PROPFEMALE > Square this afternoon ( not the same as the normal 105 degree studio , but pretty close in August ! ) ... I highly recommend the Yoga if you haven't tried it before ... Krista , thanks for the heads up on that one ... 
I just had a GREAT massage with Sloan < PROPMALE > at Atlanta Body Retreat ! She does nice Deep Tissue work , which really matters to me . Check her out if you want a great experience at www.AtlantaBodyRetreat.com .

For anyone who knows Cincinnati \Cuisine\ " ... Duncan and I are chowing down on Cheese Coney's and 4 Way's ... Great Junk Food ! " 
I started my day to day with a Race Walk on the Hill Course I've mapped out near home ... the really light mist this morning was almost like the \misting stations\ " that are now set out on courses in really hot weather ... it made for a delightful experience ! " 
First personal sign that the summer heat wave is fading ( ever so slightly ) ... driving home with the top down ! OK , I did need to have the A/C blowing on me too ... but a week or two ago there would have been NO WAY ... I LOVE Fall weather ! 
Startin ' the day with a visit to my trainer ... I never would have believed I'd be where I am physically after 9 months with this guy ... Leo T < PROPMALE > , Ultimate Performance , check him out if you are ready to make a difference in your \brain protection and transport system \"" 
Just did a 100 minute Race Walk on the Hill Course ... now I'm off to see my son play for the < PROPMALE > Football team in the Dome ... 
At the Dome , < PROPMALE > v Brookwood ... and I'd never have seats like this one for $10 at a Falcons game ! LOL ! 
I'm about to give 90 minutes of Hot Bikram Yoga a try . 
Coaching Quote of the Day : \Abundance cannot exist where there is Complexity or Drama \""

Just finished the US 10 K Classic on Cobb Parkway ... did a PB Racewalking at 1:23 ( 13:23 split avg per mile ) ... it was a great race day today with PERFECT weather ! 
I LOVE having an LA Fitness 5 minutes drive from the office ... while I didn't love my 1st appointment this morning cancelling without any kind of advance message , it let me jump in the car , get into the pool , knock out 1000 yards , and be back for my next call ... all within an hour ... and I feel GREAT ! ( OK , I do smell like a swimming pool ... ) 
Friday night , Raider Valley , end of the half ... Walton 27 , Campbell 0 . 
Just finished driving the Bimmer with the top down for the East Cobb Business Association in the East Cobber Parade ... it was like being on 285 doring a rush hour traffic jam except for the little kids picking < PROPFEMALE > out of the street ... now I'm waiting to get released from the holding area at the finish of thge parade ... it IS just like rush hour ... 
Ya ' gotta ' love an allergy season that makes just one eye tear almost continuously and itch for two plus days ... 
I just got some relief after 24 hours of a \no op\ " laptop ... my sense of relief and happiness is balanced by the realization of how much of my business life is tied to that machine ... time to figure out some back-up alternatives ... " 
Just had more \no op\ " time with the laptop ... now have a desktop in it's place ... AAAAAAAHHHHHHH !!!!!!! " 
It's been a great weekend for inspiring messages from people I respect ... this one came through < PROPFIRST > Cunningham ... \

Out doing fundraising with the < PROPMALE > Wrestling Team on a beautiful Fall day ... selling Butcher's Choice Meats door to door ... we're 60% ahead of last year's pace on fundraising ... and getting people great meats at a lower price than the grocery store ... and the kids are learning some great life lessons about tenacity and \asking for the order \"..." 
Dreams give us the \Why\ " for our lives ... Vision gives us the \ " What\ " for our lives ... Goals give us the \ " How\ " for our lives ... Plans tell us how to Act with Intent ... and Action with Intent gives us the Results for our lives ... and Results are the currency of Dream Fulfillment ... " 
The good news ... my laptop is back after a week plus in the shop ... the challenge ... processing the nearly 600 e-mails that were sent ... the funny part ... listening to the Outlook reminder system ring incessantly to let me know about the 37 appointments that I missed ... 
Every once in a while today the peace of my office is shattered by the Blue Angels flying by as they practice for the weekend ... ya ' gotta ' LOVE the Sound of Freedom ! And their formations are looking really good ... it's gonna ' be a great airshow ! 
Driving south on I-75 a few minutes ago and a Blue Angel crossed over at about 500 ft at maybe Mach 0.5 ... OOOOOHHHH YYYYEEEEAAAAAA !!!!!!!!! 
What's more dangerous than texting while driving ? Being on I-75 while the Blue Angels and Snowbirds are practicing for the weekend shows and everybody is gawking while they drive ! Of course , I was one of them ! I can't wait for the weekend ! 
Temps in the 70's , CAVU ... Blue Angels in 30 minutes ... what a GREAT day for an airshow !!!

Atlanta has been hammered by this snow , people are having to stay home , but we're able to maintain contact and relationships with Facebook , e-mail , phones , etc ... even do work ... it's really is a wonder of the times we live in ... and also makes me wonder just what the possibilities could be when the weather's good again ! 
WTF !!!!
