Today I vow to lift up all my sistas and to honor them in good times and otherwise ; we are the glue that holds it together for everyone else ( for the fathers , children , our employers and clients ) , but rarely take enuf time to nurture the void that can only be filled by the validation of another woman who genuinely understands our journey .
