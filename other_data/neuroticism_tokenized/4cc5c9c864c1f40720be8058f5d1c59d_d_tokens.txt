Finally ... some time to relax after another busy day . 
Spending the day with Tony ... It's a nice break from the usual stuff . 
I had the most wonderful day ! I am so tired now , but it was well worth it . 
Back to work ... again . 
I do anything and everything Mr. Stark asks me to do , and occassionally take out the trash . Will that be all ? 
He's been sitting in his lab ... just polishing his suit for an hour now . 
I'm so glad to be in a passionate relationship with < PROPFIRST > Stark . 
I think you should know that I would never go on without you ... 
God , I love proposals ... congrats to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Watson ! 
< PROPFIRST > , when you leave for D.C. tomorrow , just know that I will be waiting for you and longing for you . 
Hopefully Rhodes is going to be keeping me company while < PROPFIRST > is in D.C. 
I just dropped < PROPFIRST > off at the airport and he is on his way to D.C. in the Stark Industries private jet . He kissed me before boarding ... I miss him already ! I'm sure everything will be fine though . 
Ugh ... I hate job hunting . 
< PROPFIRST > met with the congressman in D.C. , wish I were there , but I'm just glad he's having a great time . 
Saw Iron Man 2 for the second time ... ah good memories . 
< PROPFIRST > is returning from D.C. today ! I am so relieved . I missed him so much ! I hate job hunting , and cannot wait to get back to work . 
< PROPFIRST > and I just returned home from the airport . He's wiped out ... and now apparently just fell asleep . 
I have got a lot of work to catch up on .... there's just piles and piles of papers stacked up on my desk ... ugh . 
Mmmm ... had a busy week . * yawn * I am tired . 
Tony ... thought I'd let you know that I love how you take three hours to make an omelet . :P 
I wake up and < PROPFIRST>'s side of the bed is empty . He left without warning , and is nowhere in the house . Any idea of where he could have gone ? 
Here I am , just lying in bed on my laptop and I don't know what to do . Anyone have any suggestions ?

Dress shopping for a wedding . I am the maid of honor ! Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . 
Almost finished packing . 
I would like a drink ... a dry vodka martini with extra olives , a lot of olives ... like at least three olives . 
On my way to the base ...
