I'm guessing a late start tomorrow ... 

Looking foreward to some extra sleep tomorrow ... 
Noon release ? Good times . 
Is it just me or did it feel like we had a lot more time to finish the test last year ? 
1st chair Concert 1 . Not too bad for Set B ... 
Why do I keep seeing the mayor at < PROPFIRST > ? 
Snow ?! I was hoping for an early spring ... 
Sox win 6-0 on opening day , Cubs lose 5-16 ... does life get any better ? 
That was a really busy weekend ... 
Forgot his camera on the last day of school :/ 
' Hawks are going to the finals ! 
Walked between < PROPFIRST > Smith's house , O'Plaine campus , and DQ a total of 8 times today . 
Hmm ... my computer's randomly playing music and I don't even have iTunes up ... 
Got home just in time to see the ' Hawks win ! 
Going to see the Sox play tomorrow :) 
The Sox are now in first place ... could anyone imagine this happening a month back ? 
Got a 5 on the AP Gov test ! 
Finally got my license :) 
Well , I'm technically an only child now . 
I guess the History Channel has taken to featuring renowned historians such as P . Diddy and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
Last day of work today . 
Went to Starved Rock State Park and WTHS made finals at ISU . Not a bad weekend ... 
So today AARP sent me my official membership card . I didn't know those bags under my eyes were so noticeable :p 
Coke dealers are invading my neighborhood ! A lady came to my door , handed me a bag with 24 cans of Coke , wished me happy holidays and disappeared into the night . Strange ... 
Though the first half was pitiful , < PROPMALE > Hanie has my gratitude for saving the Bears ' dignity . 
32 on my first ACT ! 
Somehow , I managed to make it into Symphonic 2 :)
