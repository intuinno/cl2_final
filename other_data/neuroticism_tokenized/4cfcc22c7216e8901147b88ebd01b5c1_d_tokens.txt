:( R.I.P , < PROPFIRST > . This life will never < PROPFEMALE > on ... this life has become Fiction . 

\Telephone\ " by Lady Gaga is waaaay too addicting . ' Stop telephoning me-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-meeeh . '" 
Big Red gum + Dr. Pepper = the best mixture ever ! :D 
I know the pieces fit , ' cause I watched them fall away . Mildewed and smoldering , fundamental differing . Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers ' souls in motion . Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication . The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us . So we cannot seem to reach an end , crippling our communication . 
Sweet berries , ready for two ghosts are no different than you . Ghost are now waiting for you , are you dreaming ? Dreaming denied . Do we , do we know when we fly ? When we , when we go do we die ? Sweet berries , ready for two ghosts are no different than you . Ghosts are now waiting for you , are you dreaming ? 
\You're not buying it . And if it shows up at my house ... I'm going to Donkey Punch you . \ " - me telling Atrum she can't buy me the Vitamin String Quartet's \ " Strung Out on Avenged Sevenfold\ " . This is what my arguments boil down to ; vulgar things that make people hate me . " 
Now some men like the fishin ' ... and some men like the fowlin ' . And some men like < PROPFEMALE > hear , < PROPFEMALE > hear cannon ball a roarin ' . Me I like sleepin ' ... specially in my < PROPFEMALE>'s chamber . But here I am in prison ! Here I am with a ball and chain , yeah ! Musha ring dum a doo dum a da ! 
Rebel souls ; deserters we've been called . Chose a gun , and threw away the sun . Now these towns , they all know our names . The death punch sound ! is our claim to fame . And that's why they call me , bad company , I can't deny . Bad , bad company ' till the day I die . 
Shriek the lips across ragged tongue . Convulsing together , sing violently . Move the jaw , cry aloud . Bound up the Dead , triumphantly . The ragged they come and the ragged they kill ! You pray so hard on bloody knees . The ragged they come and the ragged they kill ! Down in the cool air I can see . ( eep ! < PROPMALE > Zombie addiction ! ) 
I < PROPMALE > kur < PROPFEMALE > , Seta , I a < PROPFEMALE > a se taaksepäin . Te ei koskaan loukkaantunut we nyt kuluva hyvin , < PROPFEMALE > I erittäin hyvin halu te toivoisin olevani hiljentää kotona minun elinikäinen jotta auttaa we olla tasalla avulla kipeys .

UltraBitch will be your Huckleberry , Cevyn Dunlap ! >:D * points to self * 
I can't stand it when people ignore me . It's downright rude and disrespectful . Whatever ... I'm tired and in a bad mood , now , from the silent treatment that's been inflicted upon me . It's probably not intentional , but it's still managed to rub me the wrong way . Going to bed now , waking up early to go with everyone to the college . Here's to hoping I have more good dreams about getting < PROPFIRST > from hot chicks . 
I'd like to think that there was some reason you kept waking me up during my dreamless sleep , my dearly departed friend . (( just decided to chill on the computer until everyone's ready to go ... which I have no idea when that will be . )) 
The trash fire is warm , but nowhere safe from the storm . And I can't bare to see , what I've let me be . So wicked and worn . So as I write to you , of what is done and to do . Maybe you'll understand , and won't cry for this man . ' Cause low man is due . But I lie , lie straight to the mirror , the one I've broken , to match my face . ( Metallica = love ) 
I am a plastic man , wish I can be the one you could be proud of . I'm losing heart again , wish I could show you what you think I'm made of . Someday I know I'll find my place , someday I know this pain will fade . Someday I know I'll find my place , someday I'll sing my last refrain . 
\We're gonna go hide behind this haggard-ass dumpster . \ " < PROPFEMALE > La Bam Margera ! lolololol . " 
( Hrm . I'm feeling a nice , big bowl of Count Chocula . ) I couldn't face a life without your light , but all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight . So save your breath , I will not care . I think I made it very clear . You couldn't hate enough to love , is that supposed to be enough ? I only wish you weren't my friend , that I could hurt you in the end . 
( Gotta say ... that bowl of Count Chocula was pretty amazing . ) Grab my glasses , I'm out the door ; I'm fixing to hit this city . Before I leave brush my teeth with a bottle of < PROPFIRST > , ' cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin ' back . 
Just remembered the old story < PROPMALE > told me about the snake eating his green parrot , years ago . Apparently the bird loved showers . This lead me to thinking of Paco . Which lead me to thinking of Cevyn's dad calling Paco a \Feathered Fuck\ " . Which made me laugh . A lot . " 
Sitting and listening to < PROPMALE > play guitar while Zach screams random phrases in the background ; just like old times when nothing mattered and we were all one happy family . I can honestly say that sitting beside < PROPMALE > was something I thought I'd never do again . 
Dr. Pepper and Lays Potato Chips at 6:33 in the morning . I'm so healthy ! lmao . I'm also playing Pokemon < PROPFEMALE > on my Nintendo DS . Which is a good sign that I'm a fatass nerd trapped in this body . Although ... my Pokemon could beat your Pokemon . :| Level 100 Dialga for the win . 
I get the funny feeling , that's alright ... < PROPFIRST > says it's better than air . I'll tell you why . Drain the pressure from the swelling , this sensation's overwhelming . Give me a long kiss goodnight , and everything will be alright . Tell me , < PROPFIRST > , I won't feel a thing ... so give me Novacaine . 
Mama , we all go to hell . I'm writing this letter and wishing you well . Mama , we all go to hell . Well now , mama , we're all gonna die . Stop asking me questions , I'd hate to see you cry . Mama , we're all gonna die . And when we go , don't blame us . We'll let the fires just bathe us . Mama , we're all full of lies . Mama , we're ment for the flies . And right now they're building a coffin your size . Mama , we're all full of lies . 
Sitting here , waiting to go home . Desperately craving some fast food . :( I'm freaking starving . 
Who are you calling a Cootie < PROPFEMALE > , you Lint Licker ?! 
Not looking forward to tomorrow ... never thought I'd come to hate getting out of the house as much as I have these past few months . My inner-hermit is screaming at me ... pretty much telling me that this is why we never left the house before , too much disappointment and aggrivation waiting outside that door . 
My mouth hurts . So . Effing . Bad . Augh !! ... I haven't had a kanker sore this bad since Cevyn accadentally punched me in the face . Only this time it's not as fun , ' cause I don't get a fat lip and a black mouth out of it ... no , I just get excruciating pain that wakes me up , it's so bad . Time to go gargle more salt water ... I did yesterday and the kanker sore actually started bleeding . Yes ... it's THAT bad . 
I'll be eighteen in ten days ... and somehow I'm not looking forward to it . I mean , honestly , the only perks with becoming eighteen , nineteen and twenty is smoking . Twenty-one , legal age to drink . Whoopty-damn-doo . What else comes with these ages ? Bills ; car payments ; house rent ; morgages ; groceries . Everything my mind was absent of , seventeen years prior , suddenly comes rushing into my skull on February 23rd . Woohoo . 
Hatter : \You've lost your muchness !! You used to be much ... muchier ...! \ " // Alice : \ " My ... muchness ?? \"" 
So I was pretty much just blamed for the dogs getting outside because I was close enough to stop them , but too distracted to notice . I'm slowly giving up on everything . What's the point in continuing this path ? To become a tattoo artist ? Whoopty-doo . Who's gonna remember ? Who's gonna care ? Other than my friends who are naturally going to say they do ... it's their job . 
And in reference to my last post ... that's exactly what knowing me and being my friend pertains to ... a job . A very exausting job that's not worth it , as aforementioned by several people . I wonder what it would be like if I just vanished for a while ? 
P . S . ) My Watchers on DeviantART need to quit being lazy and join my group ! >:( < PROPFEMALE>'s the only one that loves me on that site anymore ! FOR SHAME . 
Talking to < PROPFIRST > on Facebook Chat ... resisting the urge to quote < PROPFIRST > the Unicorn at him as much as I can . lmao . Must ... not ... mention ... bridge . 
< PROPFIRST > the Unicorn has been quoted . And < PROPFIRST > the Human laughed . 
Kicking ass at Pokemon : Soul Silver Version . Just caught an Ekans , now I'm fixing to try and find Nidoran . 
Cuccoo for Coco Puffs . :3 Think I might play some < PROPFEMALE > today . 
I'm ready for Jenn to transfer to Mabank and the store in Kaufman to close down . Maybe then she can actually have some off days and we can < PROPFEMALE > out . 
I think I just left my mother the longest comment on her status that I've ever managed to conjure up . However ; it was completely relevant and even earned me a fist-bump from Cevyn . Those don't come lightly . My day is complete . Now to eat Peppered < PROPFIRST > Link's Beef Jerky in celebration . Huzzah . 
I'm tempted to try and find Hughe < PROPFEMALE > on Facebook Mobile , to become a fan ... but the last time I did that , it didn't bode well . I attempted to look up Zach Braff on my phone . Indeed I found him , though it wasn't the real him . And he was in a relationship with < PROPFIRST > . ( Avid Scrubs fans will know who he is ) Awkward . 
Riza Hawkeye : \Because there's someone I have to protect . And it's not a burden someone forced on me ; it's a deciscion I made for myself and I take full responcibility every time I fire a round . But he's the reason I squeeze the trigger . And I won't ever hesitate to do it until the day he acomplishes his goal . \ " [[ Probably one of my favorite lines from Fullmetal Alchemist . Because it's exactly how I feel . ]] " 
Reeeeaaaaally wish I had some Prismacolor Color Pencils ... unfortunately , they cost $50 . :( They're amazing , though . 
4-20-2010 ... Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood comes out on Blue-ray and DVD . 
Ugh . It's only April and I can already feel the miserable Texas summer weather . 
The Wonderland in my mind has changed ... things are very much the same , the people have just aged ; some have grown distant , others gone away , and new characters are not as I remembered them to be . It's becoming less and less of my place of refuge and solidarity . The world inside of me has changed . The mountians seem higher , the grass is dead and the wind is cold . That summer has long since left me , and it burns . 
No better band to listen to than H.I.M. when I'm feeling neostalgic . 
So I'll sift through this Eternity ... my Memory Of my past passing me like Lightwaves . 
Where will I go ? I seem to be walking in circles , waiting for answers . What if the answers I receive aren't what I want to hear ? I feel every benevolent force has shut me out , tired of hearing my voice . I am very much alone in this , my next movements , but perhaps that's how I wish it to be . The strength of will accounts for nothing when your knowledge is as blank as paper . 
It takes a real woman to put lotion on her legs while playing Final Fantasy VII . 
If anyone's still willing to buy us household items ... we need a dish scrubber brush , a mixing bowl , measuring cups and decent cooking pans . 
Sitting up on my roof ... bored out of my mind . I really need something to do . 
I'll die in the clouds above . And you that I defend , I do not love . Where will I meet my fate ? Baby I'm a man , I was born to hate . And when will I meet my end ? In a better time you could be my friend . [ I still miss you . ] 
Starting to actually hate my ethnicity . Something I haven't done since childhood . 
Bioshock is pissing me off , and I love it . Messing with the Big Daddies is awesome ... if you get too close to their Little Sisters , the get maaaad . 
On our way , setting sail soon . My phone , as well as Cevyn's , will be out of commission until Thursday . 
Coming into port ... I don't wanna come home . 
Ya'll nigga's postin in a Troll thread ! * point * 
Anybody know where I can buy some cheap scarfs ? I need to increase my wardrobe . 
Does anyone know why my boyfriend didn't go to sleep until six this morning when he has to work at five this afternoon ??? If someone kept him up , I'm not gonna be a happy camper . >:( 
These past few days have felt like they're creeping past at a snails pace . Hope things speed up soon . Also , I should have borrowed more movies from Jenn . I forgot we have nothing to watch in this house . Lol . 
Bought Left 4 Dead 2 . Desperately need Xbox Live to make it pure kickass ! 
:| I desperately need a job . All I do is sit around the house ... and so I've developed a new habit ... constantly eating . I just keep eating and eating and can't stop . Even when I'm full to the point of vomiting . >:( It's all because of that stupid cruise !! 
I think it's bad when you start having dreams of eating at Sonic . Now that I'm awake , the fat lady inside me wants McDonalds . However , in the dream , all the cooks and servers were asian , which made me desperately miss < PROPFEMALE > and Wayan ... two awesome crew members we met on the cruise . They were both from Indonesia . :) 
Raaah ! I'm a shark , I'm a shark ! Suck my < PROPMALE > !! I'm a shark ! 
Ugh ... I've been cleaning since 3:30 this afternoon ... on my seventh load of laundry ; just one blanket left ! Swept the room twice spent three hours cleaning the shower , washed all the pillow cases and every single last piece of dirty clothes , changed trash bags , etc . I'm exhausted !! @#$ *%^+/@* #hsjdkrjowlahdhsddsddkd ....!!! 
Bum da bum de bum , Inspector Gadget ! 
Thinking about looking into anti-depressants . I've been struggling , for weeks now , and just haven't said anything . I'll randomly get depressed for no reason . I'll think the way I used to think back in 2005 and consider things I wouldn't normally consider . It's been happening since before Jenn's graduation . It's annoying and potentially dangerous . 
If I'm destined to constantly feel this way , for the rest of my life , I'll just go the way of the beloved < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Poe . Drink myself into a stupor and plead with the Lord to have mercy on my drunken death-bed . And my soul from out that shadow , that lies floating on the floor ... shall be lifted , nevermore . 
Natsukashikanaru , konna itami mo kangei < PROPFIRST > ! 
Well ... we just found out our back door floods . Our kitchen is now filled with water . 
Ugh ! I don't know what's wrong with this phone , but it's pissing me off . I can't send or receive texts ... I haven't had ANY service all day . I'll be surprised if it posts this . 
Cevyn was so sweet and bought me Part One of Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood last night at walmart . I watched all thirteen episodes today and laughed my ass off in some parts . Especially when < PROPMALE > mentions < PROPFIRST>'s heavy weight Automail could be what's stunting his growth and he fantisizes himself to be super tall ... the sad thing is , he was as tall as Cevyn . \Rofl\ " moment . " 
Reeeally wish I had a laptop . I love to draw , but I'm getting tired of it . I want to write ! Create new stories and work on old ones I couldn't finish . I have so much time to do so , but with no means to do it . 
Mmm . Pickles and a Dr. Pepper at 2 in the morning ' cause I can't sleep . Nothing better ! 
Werther's Original caramel candies are amazing . It's like an orgy in my mouth ! 
I'll say this ... if Nintendo doesn't get their fucking acts together ... Playstation and Xbox will send them to the same grave as Sega . Their days are numbered if this shit keeps up . Maybe they should make a good console like the 64 ... rather than the shitty ass Wii which doesn't have the proper system for good graphics ! The Conduit is a good example of what I'm talking about . Look at the fucking cars ! 
=3 = Drawing Atrum is proving to be my biggest challenge yet . For whatever reason , \Alejandro\ " by Lady Gaga is helping . Atty-Atty-Atrum ~." 
Hey guys ... guess what Cevyn bought today . Can you say Left 4 Dead 2 online ? 
To everyone who has my number , you REALLY need to be patient . My phone has -no service- . It's impossible to send ( OR RECIEVE ) pictures , to get online , to make calls and half the time I can't even send or recieve texts . So please don't blow up my phone asking if I got anything . I'll respond as soon as they come through . ( I'M NOT SAYING THIS AGAIN . I'M TIRED OF REPEATING THAT I HAVE NO SERVICE . ) 
Yum . Chocolate donuts with milk . 
Bored bored bored . Can't sleep . So I'm playing games on addictinggames.com . Fun stuff , really . 
Hum diddlefiddle . I want to save up for a tattoo , but I don't know what to get . Apparently < PROPFIRST > from Big Willies in Kemp is really good , so I'll go to him . And before anyone says it ... I'm not getting a Jimmy-related tattoo yet . I'm doing that one way later . So please don't suggest it , like ... a thousand times . 
Went to the doctor today . She couldn't figure out why I've been having chest pains for the past two weeks , so they did bloodwork and a chest x-ray . In the meantime I have to take 800mg of Ibuprophine twice a day until my blood and x-ray come in . Now I'm just bored while Cevyn's at work . lol . 
Also ... while I was at the doctor ... Cevyn was such a sweetheart . He was chilling at his parents before work and when I found out they were going to draw blood I called him , because I'm deathly afraid of needles . And like the hero he is , he came up to the hospital to hold my hand . The little things make a day . 
Just made a Xanga . lol . I missed having one . Check it out if you guys want . http://xx-prettyhandsomeawkward.xanga.com/ 
God , I fucking love my profile picture . Herp derp . 
Off to play Sims3 and have a shit ton of babies with my Cevyn sim !! 
Going to bed early , guys . Nothing to do and I'd rather spend time with Cevyn than just sit on the computer and not do anything . Goodnight . 
Just downloaded the entire 1994 Seal album , ' Seal , ' onto my phone . Now I'll never be without a bit of soul music . lol . I also downloaded the entire 2005 Avenged Sevenfold album , ' City of Evil , ' so I'll never be without a bit of neostalgia . 
Fucking Left 4 Dead 2 online sucks tonight . All the people playing as the survivors quit like little bitches ' cause they got their asses handed to them within the first five minutes . They just mad because we were organized and they weren't . 
Been drawing in photoshop the past four hours ... my hand is killing me . Taking a break so I can eat because my hunger is starting to make me sloppy . I'm so happy with this drawing , so far , though ! I'm getting so much better at photoshop ! Now if only I had the money to buy it . lol . 
I love living on my own . I can listen to Three Days Grace as loud as I want . :) 
Happy 29th birthday , < PROPFIRST > ! For all you Deathbats out there , our dear Synyster Gates is now officially one year away from being old . lol . Kidding , Bri ... Atrum will always love you . People don't make up nicknames like \SynnySynSynnerSyBriBri\ " unless they love someone . :| And that should concern me ... but it doesn't! " 
Looks like I'll be heading to bed early tonight . Perhaps tomorrow I won't wish that Hell Girl was real . Oh well . Cevyn's odd humming is more pleasing to the ear than the sound of a keyboard all night . 
:( I have got to stop watching A7X All Excess on a loop . It's not helping the fact that it's been almost eight months . How long it's been ; the fact that it's so close to a year , is a hard pill to swallow . I had hoped to go to more than one concert in my lifetime - in his lifetime - because it was amazing ... but that option died out with any < PROPMALE > of me meeting him . Because it's just not the same without him there . 
Mmm . Breakfast < PROPFEMALE > Kat ... how I love thee . 
Fucking hungry as shit . Had a nice anniversary , though , just laying in bed with Cevyn not doing shit while he played Doom with < PROPMALE > . We had almost all day to ourselves , it was quite enjoyable . 
Those two McDonalds hamburgers were delicious ~ . lol . My diet is so healthy . 
Wow ! It must be < PROPMALE > night tonight on Left 4 Dead 2 ! I need more decent people to play with ... like zombiequeen , DGB , Cox and Twilight . ( and no , he is not a fan of fucking stupid ass sparklefaggot Twilight . ) Those were some good team mates ! And funny as hell ! 
Is it always like this ? 
I MADE SOUP AND OH MY GOD IT IS FREAKING DELICIOUS . 
\We share a common discomfort now . \ " \ 
Photoshop and I make beautiful children together . 
ROFLMFAO . Atrum just made me laugh SO FUCKING HARD . Oh my God , dude ! That was fucking amazing ! The Squeaky Stallion Duck strikes again !! 
40's in the paaaark . Makes me want to feel good . 
I got an F and a C and I got a K too , now all that's missin ' is a bitch like U . What's my name , what's my name ? Ah , ah-ah , ah-ah . Hold the S because I am an AINT . What's ny name , what's my name ? Ah , ah-ah , ah-ah . \ 
\ 
This song always makes me think of Zach . 
\Kissing You Goodbye\ " by The Used is certianly helping with my newest pencil portrait . " 
I suppose I'll follow the trend ... like my status and I'll name a like , dislike , first impression and secret confession . 
HI , < PROPFIRST > MAYES HERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT TODAY IS HONORARY < PROPFIRST > MAYS CAPS LOCK DAY . FOR ONE DAY ONLY -YOU- CAN SCREAM JUST LIKE ME , < PROPFIRST > MAYS . ALL IT TAKES IS THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON AND THEN ... BOOM ! IT'S LIKE MAGIC ! REMEMBER , FOR THIS ONE DAY ONLY , DO NOT LET GO OF THE SHIFT KEY . AND ALSO ... YOU READ THIS IN MY VOICE . 
HI , < PROPFIRST > MAYS HERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I REALLY WANT SOME FUCKING CHINESE FOOD !

Durr hurr , Metallica ~ . <3 
Die die die , my darlin'! Don't utter a single word . Die die , die , my darlin'! Just shut your pretty eyes , I'll be seein ' you again . <3 
Four more days until our Nightmare is upon us . Four more days until our hearts break as one . We're a < PROPMALE > and loyal pack , sticking together through thick and thin . We've heard the seven trumpets sound ... we've awoken those who have fallen ... we've seen the city of evil in all it's < PROPFEMALE > and we've taken vengeance sevenfold upon our enemies . Diamonds in the rough we stand together foREVer and for always . 
Have I ever mentioned how much I love The Used ? :) < PROPMALE > McCracken is a greasy motherfucker and in desperate need of a shower , but his songs are so angry and appealing to my inner wanna-be rockstar . 
I've come to this conclusion : As long as little girls talk about Twatlight , I'm going to continue despising it . Don't tell me to read the books , I don't need to JUST to conclude my already gained knowledge that Meyer does nothing but brag about < PROPFIRST > and spend the other 5% of the books creating no plot . Don't bitch at me , and I won't bitch at you . 
Long hair is soooooo annoying . I miss my short hair . :( I'll be glad when it's October and Atrum visit me . Then I can chop it all off again . :D 
Gotta love blasing Avenged Sevenfold so loud that you wouldn't be able to hear a tornado siren going off right beside your ear . \ 
<3 \The Fight \"." 
And I know you hear their voices ( calling from above ) . And I know they may seem real ( these signals of love ) . And it hurts to know that you belong here , yeah . No one to call , everybody to fear . Your tragic fate is looking so clear , yeah .... Oh , it's your fuckin ' nightmare ! \ 
[[ <3 The Family is still living this Nightmare . ]] 
MCDONALDS . IS . DELICIOUS . 
What with your Tweetbooks and your Facespaces an ' shit .... \ 
<3 Oh Atty ~ ... you slay me ~ . 
Don't play those violins no more . Their melancholic overtones , they < PROPFEMALE > off the floor and walls . I cannot bear to hear them . 
To all my deviantART watchers : enjoy my new bout of depressing poems . :D 
Today is the seven month anniversary of the loss of our beloved < PROPFIRST > . Not only that , I got my copy of Nightmare in the mail today . Apparently that wasn't enough ; a huge thunderstorm just rolled in out of nowhere about around 1 p . m .. Somehow , though ... I'm okay with this . Sitting and listening to \Heron Blue\ " with the storm in the background is comforting . " 
Mmm . Beef stew . 
So ... tired ... but must ... write .... UGH . Thankfully chapter two will be shorter than chapter one and probably not as detailed . Although , I still have to post my third installment to my Dream Theatre project . For those of you wondering , ( like , the one person that reads my statuses ) my stories can be found on my new dA < PROPFEMALE > . Just ask for it , if you want it . 
Been working in photoshop for the past five hours . Time for a break . I think I'll have me some Coco Puffs . <3 :) 
Guess I'll be turning in early tonight . Goodnight , guys . 
Trashed and scattered again , I'm feeling so low . You waste your breath by fucking with me , my blood is so cold . 
\Mezmer\ " by Pinkly Smooth = <3 \ 
So Avenged Sevenfold's album Nightmare is now the #1 Album in < PROPFEMALE > . Anybody who doesn't like that , or the band , can shut the fuck up . They worked so hard to release this album and they fucking deserve this shit ... and somewhere , < PROPFIRST > is smiling . 
There's blood on my hands , like the blood in youuuu . Some things can't be treated , so don't make me - don't make me be myself around you ! [[\Blood On My Hands\ " by The Used - my song for everyone who pisses me off . <3 I love < PROPMALE > McCracken . ]] " 
When I look in the mirror every morning , I see < PROPMALE > McCracken staring back at me ... and he sings \Born To Quit\ " at me with a smile . :) I love The Used . " 
Trust to take the right to leave me . \ 
Waiting under dark clouds for the rain . \ 
Praying lightning strikes a change . \ 
foREVer . <3 
LMAO . I started playing \Nightmare\ " by Avenged Sevenfold and Cevyn thought the chimes in the beginning were the Ice Cream Man . He got all excited for nothing . " 
Laying in bed listening to COLD while Cevyn is out eating lunch with Autumn and < PROPFEMALE > . Fun fun . I'm bored ... tired of playing on the computer ... maybe I'll just lock the door sleep . Dunno . I'll figure something out , I always do . :) 
That's the only bad part about commenting on Avenged Sevenfold's statuses ... fifteen million people and their fucking dog wanna be your friend five seconds after you click ' post ' . \ 
IF . WE . HAVE . NEVER . MET . DO . NOT . TRY . TO . ADD . ME . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Christ !! So frustraiting ! 
So .... Boooooored .... D: 
What I've felt , what I've known . Never shined through in what I've shown . Never be , never see . Won't see what might have been . What I've felt , what I've known . Never shined through in what I've shown . Never free , never me . So I dub thee unforgiven . \ 
? The Unforgiven - Metallica 
Trust I seek and I find in you , every day for us something new . Open mind for a different view , and nothing else matters . Never cared for what they say , never cared for games they play . Never cared for what they do , never cared for what they know . And I know . So close no matter how far , couldn't be much more from the heart . foREVer trusting who we are , no nothing else matters . <3 
:) Dreams really do come true ! Too bad they're not the fucking ones I want . 
In light of my recent profile picture : ... Red and grey is not the fuckin'- ... NOT the new black . PINK is like I TOLD him ...!! 
So . Tired . Of newfags . The summerfags aren't as bad , because they aren't yearly , but dammit .... I'm no oldfag , but even I know that /b/ is circling the shitter . And Moot's a dumbass for thinking the shitty captcha alone would get rid of the spam . 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor . <3 
Cramping and itching for a fistfight . Someone go find me that chicken-shit , Chadney , so I can beat the fuck out of him and his gay lover , Fagitt . At least I can see my feet over my fat rolls you butthurt little bitch . Don't whine at me about how every female on the face of the earth has KNOWN you're a flaming homo since birth , just because your stupid ass knocked up your bitch and now you gotta put a ring on it . 
Okay , so ... apparently I have a problem while I sleep . Every so often ( it's never a consistant time , always at random ) I wake up with a horrible pain on the inside of my cheeks and there will be a sore at some random place on my cheeks . Sometimes near the front , sometimes near the back . It'll last for a few days and my cheek will swell until it heals . You know what it is ?? I bite chunks out of my cheeks in my sleep . 
Life ... can really fucking suck sometimes ... and I really hate being so fucking paranoid . 
I've got to breathe ... you can't take that from me . ' Cause it's all that you left that's mine . 
aldkjghcviubrej .... so . fucking . tired . 
Song of the day : \Impossible\ " by Shontelle . " 
My hair is curleh ... ' cause I fell asleep after my showah . 
My Dick : sick and dangerous . Your Dick : quick and painless .

' Beauty is in the crystaline eye of he who beholds my tragedies and makes them worth while . Thine eulogy unto mine lullaby . To what discord do we bestow upon our bretheren to the point of your theatrical humor ? Love was but a lie , the lie was but a dream ... and this life was nothing more than mere fiction . ' \ 
Thinking about turning that into a story . Yes ? No ? 
So nice to see your face again . Tell me , how long has it been ? \ 
Since you've been here . \ 
You look so different than before . You're still the person I adore . \ 
Maybe it's a bitter wind . A chill from the pacific rim . \ 
That brought you this way . ( brought you my way)\ 
You just get me , like I've never been gotten before . \ 
So nice to see your face again . Tell me , will this ever end . \ 
Don't disappear ... \ 
Five days . 
If someone said three years from now , you'd be long gone . \ 
I'd stand up and punch them out , ' cause they're all wrong . \

Summer has come and past , \ 
The innocent can never last . \ 
Like my fathers come to pass , \ 
Seven years has gone so fast . \ 
Here comes the rain again , falling from the stars . \ 
Drenched in my pain again , becoming who we are . \ 
As my memory rests , \ 
But never forgets what I lost . 
God , somebody , break me from this . \ 
I need happier songs in my music library . \ 
Too many songs that talk about the past . 
I got back my letters , ages ago , your address unknown . \ 
I passed a stranger , who had your eyes . Or was it you ? \ 
Remember , and live forever . \ 
Remember , to live for love . \

[ He ] didn't say a word , just walked away . \ 
[ He ] was the first to go . \ 
And when [ he ] left me for [ dead ] , \ 
I was the last to know . 
This world will never be , what I expected . \ 
And if I don't belong , who would have guessed it ? \ 
Even if I say , \it'll be alright . \ " \ 
I can't believe how you looked at me , \ 
With your < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > glossy eyes . \ 
With your tight jeans , and your long hair . \ 
And your cigarette-stained lies . \ 
Could we fix you , if you broke ? \

Where you can stay\ 
You can stay awake forever\ 
How do I live without the ones I love ? \ 
Time still turns the pages of the book its burned\ 
Place and time always on my mind\ 
I have so much to say but you're so far away 
I tried running away from me\ 
Convince me that I'm wrong , but I can't\ 
Shake so unnaturally , demons they follow me\ 
I quit running away from me\ 
Convinced that I am wrong , but found out\ 
All my reasons for insanity , all a part of me\

December 11th , 2010 : this is delayed , but I want to wish a very happy birthday to Mr. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Baker ! Our little ZeeZee is now the wonderful age of 29 . Others might see it as a drag , but < PROPMALE > takes it with style and stride . One of the very few people on earth who can wear anything under the sun and make it look good , ZeeVee knows how to keep it classy , and so I say ; Peace , Love and Vengeance University ! <3 456661 
No matter how old I get , \Don't Cha\ " by Pussycat Dolls never gets old . <3 " 
\Who's Gonna Love You\ " by Pussycat Dolls = <3 " 
I don't know why , but for as long as I can remember ... one of my favorite things to do in life is watch a bunch of Avenged Sevenfold interviews on youtube , open up the window to let in the winter air , bundle up in my favorite blankie and fall asleep listening to Avenged Sevenfold for a nice peaceful nap . <3 
Boiled hotdogs + Dr. Pepper + Xbox Live Netflix + Sims 3 = night of champions . 
\Tigerlily\ " by La Roux = <3 " 
< PROPMALE>'s milkshake brings all the girls to the yard . \ 
And they're like , \we're crying so hard . \ " \ 
OH MY GOD I'M CRAMPING SO FUCKING BAD . \ 
SHOOT ME . SHOOT ME NOW . 
\Stubb ( a Dub)\ " by Mr. Bungle . \ 
\Bulletproof\ " by La Roux . \ 
I know you better than this\ 
I could be here when you call\ 
I'll make you top of the list\ 
And in the crush of the dark , \ 
I'll be your light in the mist\ 
I can see you burning with < PROPFEMALE > for a kiss\ 
Psycho-babble all upon your lips 
\El Tango de Roxanne\ " is undoubtedly my favorite song from Moulin Rouge . <3 " 
So tired . Must sleep . \ 
And dream pretty things . \ 
Ugh . 
Omfg . Cevyn bought me Red Dead Redemption for Christmas . I'm estatic right now . That game is amazing . 
Life is a harsh bitch , and Time is it's cruel mistress . 
When it rains , I don't mind . \ 
Let me stand here all night . \ 
Did he take his own life ? \ 
Let me know he's alright . \ 
And everytime it rains , \ 
I feel him holding me . \ 
Are the angels crying ? \ 
[[ It's too cold to be raining today ... ]] 
To the pack of wolves in Red Dead Redemption that thought they could kill my horse : You fail at life . I titter at your misfortune . Bow before my shotgun . 
Currently have one of four horses of the Apocolypse in Red Dead Redemption : Undead Nightmare . War . Almost had Pestilince up near Tall Trees , but a fucking bear caused me to lose him . For those of you who can't find war , I found him between Gaptooth Ridge , Tumbleweed and < PROPMALE > Point ... was on my way to Armadillo . He's easier to see at night , because he's on fire . 
Perfection , Angry Perfection and just plain Awkward . <3 Delightful . \ 
[[ huzzah for inside jokes . ]] 
Minecraft is amazing . Thank you < PROPFIRST > Dunlap and < PROPMALE > Dunlap for hooking me up with this game . Time to start building my fortress in the sky . 
I fucking love the movie Chicago . 
' Cause it's almost like , your Heaven's trying everything , to break me down . \ 
' Cause it's almost like , your Heaven's trying everything , to keep me out . \ 
[[\Far From Home\ " by Five Finger Death Punch . Insperation for my newest tattoo idea . ]] " 
lulz . I'm on Cevyn's iTouch . 
Apparently I've stepped on some rather important toes . lol . So to keep myself from being disowned ... I feel the need to smile and say , I love < PROPFEMALE > in Chains . They're an amazing band . Whatever they touch turns to gold . 
Thank you , facebook ... for doing exactly what I didn't want you to do . If I had wanted the new fucking profile , I would have updated to the new fucking profile . ON MY OWN ACCORD . I was very happy with the old profile and I kindly wish for you to fuck off . Stop trying to over-complicate your shit like myspace . 
One more month , and I shall fly away to Bat Country . 
:D Cevyn has the cutest face while he's sleeping . 
Nothing better than waking up and listening to \Crossroads\ " by Avenged Sevenfold . Definately one of my favorite songs . I've always been able to relate to it ever since I was kicked out of two different churches purely for how I dress . \ 
Now Playing : \Natural Born Killer\ " by Avenged Sevenfold . \ 
Got a strong craving for coffee today in Walmart . So Cevyn was sweet and bought me a Mocha Frappaccino . :) It may not be home-brewed , but it's just as delicious . 
It's quite embarrasing when you're trying to sing and your Labret gets caught on the top of your bottom teeth . Causing whatever it is you're trying to say to come out as garbled gibberish . Thankfully , I don't sing in front of people . 
Stop ! \ 
My breathing in the night , when you're not there . \ 
The silence ringing through my ears . \ 
And all I want to do , is hear your voice . \ 
But you're not there . \ 
Go ! \ 
Take away the pain , of being me . \ 
Soothe my soul , caress my heart . \ 
And end my fears , all my bad memories . \ 
Eradicated . 
Fuck yeah , Atreyu ! <3 
This line describes The Family perfectly , I think . Especially after all the shit we've gone through together recently . \ 
\A square < PROPFEMALE > in a black hole . We don't fit in 
Wow . My computer just had one of it's many \HURR I'M A DELL\ " moments and made the comment boxes on facebook REALLY < PROPFEMALE > . Way do go 
Oh my God , < PROPMALE > Haney was right ( like always , lol ) ... < PROPMALE > is an amazing show . 
Words cannot convey how much I love Avenged Sevenfold . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Sanders has one of the greatest voices I've ever heard . I don't care what you say and whether or not you agree with me ... this is MY opinion , my thoughts . It's not an opening for a ridiculous debate . I could seriously listen to Avenged all day long , every day , and not get tired of them . 
Twenty-five more days until I fly out to Cali to see my two favorite rockstars ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Goepel , < PROPFEMALE > Colfax ... get ready . Because for ten days in February , we are going to party hardy . :D 
I am here still waiting , though I have my doubts\ 
I am damaged at best , like you've already figured out\ 
In the pain there is healing , in your name I find meaning\ 
I'm hanging on another day , \ 
Just to see what you throw my way , \ 
I'm hanging onto the words you say\ 
You said that I will be okay 
I can't be as sorry as you think I should\ 
But I still love you more than anyone else could\ 
The splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long\ 
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong\ 
We have gone through so much worse than this before\ 
What's so different this time that you can't ignore ? 
The last girl and the last reason\ 
To make this last for as long as I could\ 
The first kiss and the first time\ 
That I felt connected to anything\ 
The weight of water , the way you taught me\ 
To look past everything I had ever learned\ 
The final word in the final sentance\ 
You ever uttered to me was love 
Wow ... Cevyn was just listening to < PROPFIRST > Lambart . Really ?? My world has been shattered ... I can't believe Cevyn would even consider listening to that queerboy . 
I love < PROPMALE > . So , so much . I just finished Season One . Now it's time for Season Two . lol . How can this show get any better ?? 
I love drawing facial expressions . It's so much fun , because there's no limit to what you can do . <3 
The beginning of \Planetary ( GO ! )\ " by My Chemical Romance makes me feel like I should have glowsticks and strobe lights . " 
I never felt that way . I never felt like a loser . You cant get what you want if you feel like its you against the world . Youll never get anywhere with negativity . I make my own opportunities . I dont feel like everything is against me .  - Zacky Vengeance . 
\I think it's been confirmed that 85-90% of the A7X Family's moms ' fangirl ' over M . Shadows . But seriously 
He wasnt addicted to anything - he was addicted to life . He was a shooting < PROPFEMALE > and those things burn out fucking quickly . \ - < PROPFIRST > Elwin Haner Jr. ( Synyster Gates ) speaking about < PROPFIRST > Sullivan . " 
I almost forgot how much I love \Dying Song\ " by HIM . \ 
Have no fear , there are wounds that are not meant to heal . \ 
And they sing , in Venere Veritas . <3 
< PROPMALE > Haney and I have the most amazing friendship . He's watched me grow up ... I've watched him get old . We've been in the most awkward situations together ; situations that would have ruined the average friendship , but didn't even phase ours . :D He's the best older brother figure that anyone could ask for ... and I love him to death ! <3 
In the middle of a gunfight\ 
In the center of a resturaunt\ 
They say : come with . your . arms . raised . high ! \ 
Well they're never gonna get me\ 
And like a bullet through a flock of doves\ 
To wage - this war against your faith\ 
In me . Your life will never be the same\ 
On your mother's eyes - say a prayer 
So who else is hella excited for my trip to California , and who else is hella excited to see the great , almighty and fabulous < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Goepel ?? \ 
Me , that's who . <3<3<3 
It's coming up\ 
It's DARE . ( ooh ! )\ 
<3 
Wheeee . Hooray for drawing ! <3 
I scream , you scream . \ 
I'll kill you for ice cream . 
I am the Gordan Ramsay of eggs . 
Fuck yeah , Metallica ! <3 
We're all stars , now , in the dope show . 
I love Tumblr too much . Everyone should make a Tumblr and follow me . 
My mother is a cruel woman . She's letting me starve . 
omg yes . Cevyn found a keyboard in < PROPFIRST>'s shed . Good thing , too ... typing with my phone was making my fingers hurt so badly . 
Look at these pidgeons !! They think they can trust us humans ?! 
Okay , so no more McDonalds right before falling asleep . Strange , cryptic dreams that are possibly trying to tell me something , or perhaps just play off my irrational fears more than I need ... you are not welcome . gtfo . 
lol . There were a bunch of nine year olds on Red Dead Redemption online ... they wouldn't stop screaming and yelling about nonsensical bullshit . So a < PROPMALE > and I teamed up and raped them . They couldn't spawn without us killing them a second later . I think they even started crying at one point . But all that matters to me , is that they took the message and quit the game . Aaah . Peace and quiet . 
Okay . Last night's dream was much more enjoyable than the previous one I had . I'm pretty sad that I woke up from it , actually . 
Nice Go-Kart driving weather . Too bad I don't know where the keys are and whether or not it's working . lol . 
Keys were found . Go-Kart is working . Wonderful drive was had . 
omg , Tumblr . ily , but ... I think we need a break . We're moving too fast . <3 
I'm excited to get my hair cut in eight days . No more of this < PROPMALE > curtian of annoying , ugly hair . Instead it will be short , stylish and beautiful like it was two years ago . <3 
Most kids have one daddy ... some even have two . But me ...? I've got five daddies . Because that's how I roll . \ 
Fuck your logic . <3 
LMAO . Atrum and I are already planning out our children's lives . Her Valary shall be married to my Zach , and they will have many babies together . We've got a Lion < PROPMALE > situation going on over here . 
Ugh . So , I'm not getting my haircut until the 10th . I guess < PROPFEMALE > was all booked up on the 7th . Kinda bummed , because I was counting down the days ... but meh . Only six more days , now , I guess . 
Time for lunch , and perhaps a bit of Red Dead Redemption . \ 
Also , only eight more days until I fly out to California . [ fuck yeah !! <3 ] 
\Machiavellism\ " by Dir en Grey is too fucking catchy for it's own good . " 
\Vanilla\ " by Gackt is the only song in the history of time that makes trumpets sound cool . " 
Happy Birthday , < PROPMALE > . Thanks for the snow . <3 
I don't think I've mentioned how much I love The Used lately . Let me do that now ... \ 
\Men Are All The Same\ " is an amazing song . I particularly love how they added the chorus to \ " Kissing You Goodbye\ " into the song at 3:38 . It just makes the song that much more badass and intense . " 
Fuck yeah !! Going to get my hair cut !! 
Wow ... I just forgot my own birthday . Special moment for Saarni . 
Packing my suitcase . Fuck yeah . Listening to \Vampire Money\ " by My Chemical Romance 
Well , I've never felt uglier in my life . 
\Please Don't Leave Me\ " by Pink = perfect for my life right now . \ 
I would never pull the trigger , \ 
But I've cried \wolf\ " a thousand times\ 
\As If By Magic\ " by La Roux . " 
Thank you Dennso Engelskirchen , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Goepel and < PROPFIRST > Gosling for cheering me up . <3 
Are you fucking kidding me ... I can't log into my youtube account until I verify the email for an email address I don't even know the password for anymore , so I can synch it with a Google account . Why the FUCK do I need to have a fucking GOOGLE ACCOUNT to watch shit on YOUTUBE . FUCK . 
Oh my God , my sleep schedual is so fucked up . I should probably try and fix it before I fly out to Cali . 
Mmm . Taquitos . 
My bags are packed . Shit just got real , yo . 
Much too excited to sleep . And nervous . Fucking planes . 
Cevyn just saw me off . That was beyond emotional . So to anyone who complains about being single , at least you don't cry like a little bitch at airports . 
So far away from where you are\ 
These < PROPMALE > have torn us worlds apart\ 
And I miss you , and I wish you ... were here\ 
I miss the years that were erased\ 
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face\ 
I miss all the little things\ 
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me\ 
-\From Where You Are\ " by Lifehouse " 
Cevyn called at eight this morning , just to hear my voice , he said . lol . How sweet . Now Atrum and I really want coffee but don't want to go out into the freezing living room . 
Conversation I just had with myself , \It's [ the bed's headboard ] breaking . [ high pitched voice ] You're breaking up with me ?? Why ? [ deep voice ] You're fat . [ high pitched voice ] Oh ... \ " \ 
My name is Atrum , and I am hacking my dear Saarni . Dear Saarni's friends : She's concerning me . :D <3 
Me : \*whispering * < PROPFEMALE > ... this is your conscience speaking ... \ " \ 
Now I think I understand\ 
How this world can overcome a man\ 
All this hurt can finally fade\ 
Promise me you'll never feel afraid 
I was in pain as I was getting my arm done ... then I put my headphones in and listened to \Fiction\ " by Avenged Sevenfold . I drifted away and it was completely bearable . <3 " 
I hope it's worth it\ 
What's left behind me\ 
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you\ 
So tell everybody\ 
The ones beside me\ 
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight 
I have to say ... I have never felt more at home than I do when I'm riding in the car with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and Atrum , and we're all screaming Avenged Sevenfold songs . 
Facebook's herpin ' it's derp like yeah . Fun times . 
FACEBOOK , I WILL MURDER YOU . 
I'm one cold hearted bitch to be able to listen to \Fiction\ " and not shed a tear . " 
Omg . Cevyn just bought me an A7X shirt that I've been wanting for over a year now . \ 
Best . Man . Ever . \ 
Suck it , you unlucky bitches . 
Am I listening to \Save Me\ " for the fifteenth time in a row ...? Why yes ... yes I am . " 
Oh my God ... Moulin Rouge ! just became available on Netflix . YES . 
Gotta love feeling like you're gonna blow chunks everywhere . 
Thank God for Zach and his bountiful supply of music . 
I need more tattoos . What the fuck . 
Okay , so that was a terrible fucking dream . Let's not ever have it again , please . 
Omg ! Nasty ass fucking medacine ! 
I like ... don't even come on Facebook anymore . I just chill on Tumblr all day . But it's only ' cause people never stop talking on Tumblr , and on Facebook , I never have any notifications or shit . Soooo . 
Well ... just got texted by some country bumpkin motherfucker in Memphis , Tenessee and got called a whore . Most hickish sounding motherfucker I've ever heard ... and I thought Texans were bad . lmao . 
Best part of the Dual Complex concert : a bunch of people standing outside playing hacky sack . \ 
Girl : \I keep stepping on this June Bug ! \ " \ 
She said \some days I feel like shit 
Bitch , please ... you just can't handle my swagger . 
New nickname , via Zach . \Mini Me . \ " I like it . \ 
My mom bought me Sims Medieval on a whim last night and just delivered it . I think this is the start to a very good year . 
Tumblr speaks the truth : \Thanks Avenged Sevenfold for making the game of Hangman feel like a Saw movie . \"" 
Assume the escort party submission position or you will miss the party . 
Look at you ... soaring majestically through the air . Like an eagle piloting a blimp . 
\I will let you down\
