Well . I made a Facebook . Because < PROPMALE > practically forced me into it . 

It's almost funny to see people ' liking ' things on Facebook that are negative . 
I've never been more confused before in my entire life . 
It's about time I got to sleep . Today was the longest day of my life . 
I have this feeling today's going to be very ... busy . 
Well .. As I thought , the day was eventful . Hanging out with < PROPMALE > Portsman tonight ... Who knows what tomorrow holds , hmm ? 
I wish things weren't so damn confusing these days . I thought I knew who I was . 
I can truthfully say , I'm glad this day is over . Staying over at < PROPMALE > Portsman's house ... Hope I can sleep . 
I was told today that I act like a pet rather than a partner around < PROPMALE > Portsman . I disagree . 
I'm so tired , but I can't get to sleep . This is the first night in a few that I've actually been alone in my apartment . 
Finally , a day that wasn't insane for once . Probably because I avoided < PROPMALE > Portsman for most of it ... I don't think I can face him . 
Ugh .. I'm so tired . I didn't sleep well at ALL . * Sigh , rubs at eyes * 
... I feel more happy right now than I've been for the past ... I don't know . The past YEAR . 
Hungry for some noodles . Taking < PROPFIRST > out tonight to get some ... Today has been an amazing day so far . 
What a day . I'm exhausted .. It's about time for me to hit the hay . 
... It feels a little weird to be awake when he`s asleep , but ... I sort of like watching him ... * sigh , blushes slightly * 
Damn it .. I thought things would get better . Now I'm even more confused . 
From the hospital with Topaz , to my apartment with < PROPMALE > ... I really hope things turn out alright . 
Things are looking up and settling down .. I just need to learn how to control myself better . 
Much better now that things are official . There are still huge steps to take in the relationship , but I'm finally HAPPY . I hope everyone else is , too . 
I was so nervous tonight , but ... it was .. amazing . * blush , sideglance * Then I came to check on things , and found .. -- \ 
* shaky sigh , holds his head * Damnit . 
I'm so tired .. Work is insane lately . I barely have time to spend with < PROPMALE > Portsman .. But I do spend most of my free time around him . 
Topaz < PROPFEMALE > is staying with me until she can get her own place .. which means she's not going to Oregon . I'm glad I influenced her to do so . 
Darkness stirs , and wakes imagination . Silently , the senses abandon their defenses .. * Sigh , smiles a bit , dreamily .. * 
I'm so exhausted . < PROPMALE > finally passed out .. I'm going between watching him sleep and .. checking in on Topaz .. I wishI could sleep , but I'm almost afraid to . 
Damnit . God-fucking-DAMNIT . Everything is complicated . Everything is CONFUSING . I hate this . I honestly .. * Grips his gun , staring down at it , eyes glazing over * .... 
Nnn .. I'm surprised it was so easy . All that's left is some paperwork and an appointment at the headquarters ... * sighs deeply * Now I'm left with other difficult things to deal with ... Like this stain on my hat . 
Everything's over , hopefully . I can relax , now .. * Sighs deeply * 
I'm .. so exhausted .. * passes out , hat over eyes * 
What the hell goes on in the Prosecutor's Office ..? * Blinkblink , blush * 
In Oregon with Topaz < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > Portsman , and Cann < PROPFIRST > . 
Perfect timing . I hope I'll be able to focus today ... 
I'm glad yesterday is over , but today is probably going to be just as bad . Maybe even worse ... 
How am I so tired ..? 
Good thing I have plenty of back-up hats . Mine seem to have a habit of disappearing or being spirited away by other people's heads ... 
Finally , back in Los < PROPFEMALE > . I can say that I'm glad to . Oregon didn't exactly suit my fancy .. I don't think I'll ever be flying in a plane again if I can help it . * Sigh*\ 
.. I also .. was able to finally tell my mother about < PROPMALE > Portsman ... She approves , which is a huge relief . My mother is the world to me ... 
Watching < PROPMALE > Portsman play soccer .. It's amusing . 
Working hard today . I want to get a raise so I can afford something nice .. * Blushes slightly * 
(( YO SUP IT'S A RARE OOC POST . Yeah so ' < PROPFEMALE > I'm < PROPMALE > and I'm sexy and yeah . <3 THE END )) 
Thanks a lot , < PROPMALE > Portsman . I'm really sore , now ... * Sighs heavily , rubs back of neck , groaning in pain * 
I have < PROPMALE > Portsman over for a Korean dinner , with my mom .. 
Ahh , < PROPFIRST > almost destroyed < PROPMALE > Portsman's soccer ball . It was an ... interesting ... sound that I heard < PROPMALE > make when he walked in and saw < PROPFIRST > with the ball in his mouth . He needs some training ... or < PROPMALE > won't have any balls left . 
Friday nights are always the best . I went out drinking with , < PROPFIRST > Meekins , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > Portsman .. It was so much fun . Hahaha .. ~ * Flushed cheeks * 
Aaaaagh .. Hangover . * Groans * 
I'm getting tired of all this confusion . I want to give up sometimes , but .. I have someone who keeps me going , and a few good friends . It's just .. I don't even know what's going on anymore , it seems ... 
Getting ready for the vacation to Vancouver , with < PROPMALE > Portsman .. I can't wait to get away . 
Well .. My vacation is soon . I get the feeling that I tag < PROPMALE > Portsman too much , but I can't help it .. I'm excited . Just a few more hours .. 
In Vancouver with < PROPMALE > .. We just arrived at the hotel . It was a long drive . We stopped in Oregon and stayed there for the night .. * Yawns slightly * But I think a nap sounds nice . 
About to go on a date .. I'm so nervous . I feel so strange without a hat , but none of mine that I brought would match this suit .. * Blushes deeply * < PROPMALE > Portsman is really excited for it , though . He looks .. really nice .. ~ 
The date was , of course , amazing . <3 I need to go to sleep , now , though .. I'm exhausted . Goodnight everyone !! 
Just enjoyed a brilliant nap . Now , < PROPMALE > Portsman and I are out to go sight-seeing around Vancouver .. I love having time away , 
I can't sleep .. Nightmares are keeping me up . I .. go through my life , seeing all these cases , these dead bodies and murderers , all of this pain and suffering .. It wouldn't bother me so much if I wasn't dreaming that I was the victim . * cringe , sideglance .. * 
< PROPMALE > and I are up early tomorrow to head out .. We should be back in L.A. before 11 at night if all goes as planned . I'm excited to see everyone I missed , but the vacation was worth it .. ~ 
About to switch shifts with < PROPMALE > Portsman .. he looks ready to pass out at the wheel . * Smile * We'll be home in three hours !! 
Home ... I missed it . * tired smile * I'll go visit everyone later ... Now , I'm going to sleep . < PROPMALE > says to say goodnight .. ~ 
Well , I'm awake now .. Haha . * Smile * It's good to be back .. I'm not too excited for work tomorrow , but it won't be too terrible . 
likes to watch < PROPMALE > sleep . He was picking on me earlier about smoking .. * sigh , slight smile * I'm just nervous . Work tomorrow/today , as well as the birthday of one of the most important people in my life . She's in England right now , though , and will be for a while . I'm not sure what to do with her gift ... 
.. I been thinkin ' , I'd like to see your eyes , open up real wide .. the minute that they see me . If you don't come through , I wouldn't wait for you .. I understand that everyone goes disappearing .. Into the greater gray , it covers over every day , it hovers in the distance , in the distance -- in the distance .. * Sighs , slight smile * Counting Crows is pretty good . ~ 
I should go to sleep . I need to work tomorrow ... * sideglance * 
Even if I'm having struggles , I need to be strong for my friends . I have no right to bring anyone down . * smiles a bit * 
< PROPMALE > Portsman ... I love you . You can make me smile , no matter how I feel .. I really appreciate all that you've done for me . But now ... it's time for a nap . So many things have happened today , and Topaz < PROPFEMALE > should be arriving tonight . Thanks , everyone .. I don't know where I'd be right now if you weren't so kind . 
Work has been keeping me so busy -- I'm sorry , everyone .. But I've been really happy . Most of my time , both at my job and at home , is being spent with < PROPMALE > Portsman ... He keeps me smiling . Life is good .. 
Spending so much time with < PROPMALE > Portsman makes me feel like nothing could ever go wrong .. I love him . So much . <3 
Oh , jeez .. < PROPMALE > Portsman's starting to take shots . * Chuckles * 
I feel bad , not being on as often as I used to be . I guess life has been busy , especially with < PROPMALE > and I ... * blushes deeply * 
... This movie is pretty creepy .. < PROPMALE > sure picked a winner . * shudder * 
< PROPMALE > Portsman ... When you smile at me , you know exactly what you do . <3 
I had been in a terrific mood after spending the Halloween weekend with < PROPMALE > Portsman .. Then , I go on Facebook to find slander on my wall . * Scoffs slightly , lowering hat over eyes * ... 
< PROPMALE > is up to something , I can tell .. I just don't know if it's good or bad . * thoughtful pout * 
Sorry about the long absense .. < PROPMALE > Portsman and I forgot about our Facebooks for a bit . I guess we were too distracted with each other .. ///; 
Nnn , today was .. a hard day to get through . I'm not feeling so good , I think I caught a cold .. And a stomachache . * Frowns , holding tummy * ;; 
After a long hiatus from work and Facebook , < PROPMALE > Portsman has deemed me healthy enough to walk around and type . ;; How has everyone been ? 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > .. And < PROPMALE > Portsman is passed out in bed . <3 I guess I'm < PROPFEMALE > tonight ? * chuckles * 
Ahh .. I've been so busy . I feel bad for neglecting Facebook , but < PROPMALE > Portsman and I have so much work to do , it's unbelievable . 
So much work .. It's good to be busy though . Even if < PROPMALE > tends to sleep on his desk while I get his work done for him . 
... * sigh * 
Putting the finishing touches on < PROPMALE>' < PROPFIRST>'s Day gift .. I hope he'll like it .
