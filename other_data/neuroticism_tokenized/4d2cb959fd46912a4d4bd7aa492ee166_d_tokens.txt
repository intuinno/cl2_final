It's hard to concentrate when you have a pounding headache . :[ 
Hospital food sucks .. Their chicken tenders taste like plastic . Anywho ... they couldn't find out whats wrong with my super bad headaches that have been constant for 2 months ... soo just got an IV and some blood work . Brain scan monday I believe . Wish me luck . :/ 
Off to the hospital once again ... <3 
Just had the ambulance show up at my house .. My mom was on her way home when I threw up 3 times .. she freaked out called 911 .. they came , checked me out , and said it was from the vicodin . I'm not taking it anymore .. 
ONE THING ALL GUYS SHOULD KNOW : We worry that other girls look better now that you are in a relationship . < PROPFIRST > nailed the core of every girlfriend's relationship insecurity on the head when he brought up the GIGS ( Grass Is Greener Syndrome ) . The idea that life is better on the other side is one of the most destructive forces in relationship world and girls feel that guys fall for it way too often . 
It is a great fear of ours that once you can’t have other girls you will suddenly want them all . It leads to a lot of unfounded jealousy brought on by innocent comments on your part or casual non-flirtatious conversations with other girls . So what’s a guy to do ? In a perfect world you’d stop interacting with other girls altogether but our rational super-ego knows that’s not realistic . 
What you need to do is follow these three simple rules ; 1 ) never pay more attention to another girl than you do to your girlfriend , 2 ) never comment over and over how hot/cool/nice/fun another girl is , and 3 ) if you meet a great girl while you’re in a relationship hook her up with one of your buddies ( also known as taking her off the market and getting her out of our face ) . 
And should you ever really get the itch to jump the fence and live life on the other side ... just do it ! Don’t lead us on , don’t cheat on us , don’t sneak around , just end the relationship . If it ends up being a GIGS fueled mistake oh well , consider it a hard lesson learned and leave us alone ... we won't want you back anyway ! 
read from bottom up , and LEARN ! :] 
What only Im up at this time !?!? WHATS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE ! GET UP !

Imagine there's no Heaven\ 
\ 
It's easy if you try\ 
No hell below us\ 
Above us only sky\ 
Imagine all the people\ 
Living for today\ 
Imagine there's no countries\ 
It isn't hard to do\ 
Nothing to kill or die for\ 
And no religion too\ 
Living life in peace\ 
Imagine no possessions\ 
I wonder if you can\ 
No need for greed or hunger\ 
A brotherhood of man 
Sharing all the world\ 
You may say that I'm a dreamer\ 
But I'm not the only one\ 
I hope someday you'll join us\ 
And the world will live as one 
With your feet in the air , and your head on the ground\ 
Try this trick and spin it , yeah\ 
Your head will collapse\ 
But there's nothing in it\ 
And you'll ask yourself\ 
'' Where is my mind ? '' .... 
If you be my star , I'll be your sky\ 
You can hide underneath me , and come out at night\ 
When I turn jet black , and you show off your light\ 
I live to let you shine\ 
but you can skyrocket away from me\ 
and never come back if you find another galaxy\ 
far from here with more room to fly\ 
just leave me your stardust to remember you by\ 
stardust to remember you by
