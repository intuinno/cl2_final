Turned the house inside-out looking for my effin ' sketchbook . \ 
Couldn't find it . BUT\ 
I did find a scratched up work-out dvd that's been lost for a while , and a work-out belt thing , one sneaker , a hairbrush , one ankle weight , and a piece of hair that chipped off my Axel figurine . \ 
I'm sure there's a message in there somewhere . 
I like how Red < PROPFEMALE > Cake batter looks like blood . \ 
:] 
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? 
I like it on my desk chair the moment I get home . 
Such sissy rain today . ._. 
Well . I found my sketchbook today\ 
as well as a library < PROPMALE > book that was due yesterday . \ 
It was tucked all neat-like in a drawer under my little sister's bed . \ 
.__________. 
Outfit's ready for the wedding thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Cebreros ~ \ 
LOVE YOU , < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Fuckin ' HATE profanity , damn . \ 
man , I also HATE haters . \ 
and hypocrites , the assholes . \ 
Irony's also a bitch . 
Heyyyy , the camera works ~ \ 
Turns out the only thing it needed was batteries . 
1 out of 10 people are born gay . That means 1 of every 10 people are \ 
instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone & so much more for \ 
something they didn't ask for , it came to them naturally . Many gay teens\ 
are turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them \ 
that life will get better , & you respect them for who they are , copy\ 
and paste this , most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . 
Yesterday smelled of burnt hair and hairspray , then stinky fish water , and then delicious steak , and then deodorant + B.O. , and then cake and OMGOMG COFFEE YEEESSSSS , and then stinky fish water again . 
:D \ 
:DDD \ 
Did I just hear thunder ? 
Make new friends , \ 
but keep the old . \ 
One is silver\ 
and the other is gold . 
is developing a grating repugnance to the phrase \I can't help it . \"" 
\Like\ " this status if I've ever made you smile in your life . Re-post this and see how many you get . " 
I do believe I have a wisdom tooth growing in . 
Going to finally go < PROPFEMALE > out with one of my best friends that I haven't seen in months . \ 
:] \ 
Happy times ahead ~ 
Meow .

ANOTHER UPDATE : Ah , well , okay . The old old old old computer got infected with something and is forced to shutdown five minutes after startup . This happened about a week ago . Now , however , my brother got the craptop working again by ( once again ) reinstalling windows . My brother's trying to install Ubuntu onto it , though . It's a different kind of Operating System . Not sure why he wants to . \ 
So yeap .
