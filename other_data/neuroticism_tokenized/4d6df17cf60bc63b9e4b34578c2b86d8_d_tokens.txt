It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now . You kicked me when I was down . I don't need you , don't want to see you . You ran me into the ground . But what comes around goes around . I don't need you . 
If opportunity doesn't knock , build a door . 
Tears are the safety valve of the heart when too much pressure is laid on it . 
Cosmic bowling tonight , its been a while ! :) 
??????????? :( ?????????????? 
\I can only tell you what it feels like . And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe . I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight . \"" 
\Nothing you confess could make me love you less . I’ll stand by you . \"" 
:( 
8 months <3 ... Toldeo move-in day :( 
I knew the whole time this day would come , so why does it still hurt so bad ? 
Grateful to all the truly wonderful people in my life , especially those who have been there for me when I need them :) Thank you ! 
\I never knew I could hurt like this . And everyday life goes on . Miss you but I try not to cry \"" 
< PROPMALE > chipolte = awesome 
Great time in < PROPMALE > today and last night with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
Missing you more than I thought i could :'( 
You leave me speechless , the way you smile , the way you touch my face . \ 
You leave me breathless , it's something that you do I can't explain . \ 
I'd run a million < PROPMALE > just to hear you say my name .

\I've never been this close to anyone or anything . \ 
got a job at pappa < PROPFIRST>'s hopefully will begin work soon :) n school , first day of my last year tomorrow

WEEKEND !!!!!!!! :) 
\I do whatever it takes . When I'm with you I get the shakes . My body aches when I aint \""

Good day today , work tomorrow , but cant wait for the weekend !

I hate creepy houses !!!! 
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems . Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano . All I know is I love you too much to walk away . 
Nobody gonna love me better . Imma stick with you forever . You know how to appreciate me . Imma stick with you , my baby . Nobody ever made me feel this way . Imma stick with you . 
is now addicted to futurama , thank you < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 
If someone seriously wants to be part of your life , then they will seriously make an effort to be in it . 
FRIDAY !!!!! :D 
9 months <3 
Baby you showed me what living is for . You lift my feet off the ground . You spin me around . You make me crazier 
Don’t know if I could ever be\ 
without u cause boy u complete me . \ 
And in time I know that we’ll both see , \ 
that we’re all we need . \ 
\ 
Cause you’re the apple to my pie\ 
You’re the straw to my berry\ 
You’re the smoke to my high\ 
and you’re the one I wanna marry . 
My heart stops when you look at me . Just one touch , now baby I believe this is real . So take a < PROPMALE > and don't ever look back . <3 
Some people want it all \ 
But I don't want nothing at all \ 
If it ain't you , baby \ 
everything means nothing if I ain't got you , yea 
Don’t know if I could ever be without u cause boy u complete me . \ 
And in time I know that we’ll both see , that we’re all we need .. \ 
And I've always lived keeping a comfortable distance because none of it was ever worth the risk , Well you are the only exception . <3 
once in your life you find someone who will turn your world around , \ 
Pick you up when your feeling down . Now nothing could change what you\ 
mean to me ? 
\You are the best thing that's ever mine\ " <3 " 
School tomorrow and the start of another boring week :( cant wait till the weekend ! :) 
I miss those blue eyes . How you kissed me at night . I miss the way we sleep like there's no sunrise . Like the taste of your smile , I miss the way we breathe . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , I hate you . Aren't we even yet ???? 
I like it on the back of my door 
If someone seriously wants to be part of you life , they will seriously make an effort to be in it . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , now i am REALLY sick of you ! will you ever stop harassing me !?? 
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile . The precious moments are all lost in the tide , they're swept away and nothing is what is seems 
Some days I feel like shit . Some days I wanna quit . I don't understand why you have to always be gone . Where'd you go ? I miss you so . Seems like it's been forever , that you've been gone . 
I promise I'll be there for you when no one else is . 
I find myself just fillin ' my time with anything to keep the thought of you from my mind . I'm doin ' fine , I plan to keep it that way . You can call me if you find that you have something to say . I miss you so , seems like it's been forever that you've been gone , Please come back home ... 
Mid ohio for the weekend :) 
People need to get the facts straight ! I feel so sorry for those families and their unimaginable loss but their placing the guilt on the wrong people ! Mentor is a great place and the school is the best i could ask for ! 
great weekend ! 
I've seen your act . And I know all the facts . I'm still in love with who I wish you were . And I wish you were here . 
I'M A\ 
HANDFUL !! Unfortunately most women won't repost this . I'm strong\ 
willed , independent , a bit outspoken and I tell it like it is . I make\ 
mistakes , I am sometimes out of control & at times hard to handle . \ 
But if you can't handle me at my worst then YOU SURE AS HELL DON'T\ 
DESERVE ME ATMY BEST !!!!!! If you're a HANDFUL , repost ! I dare you .... 
\you are the best thing in my world . \ 
I'll love you more with every breath . Truly , madly , deeply do . I will be strong . I will be faithful ' cause I'm counting on you . 
:( I miss you so , Seems like it's been forever , That you've been gone . Please come back home ... 
I love the way you lie . Right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe . I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight . 
I was the one who gave you my heart and soul but it wasn't good enough for you 
why am I trying to see when there aint nothin in sight ? \ 
why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try ? \ 
why am i dying to live , if im just living to die ? 
Tired of the things you say ! I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday . 
When I say I'ma do somethin I do it , I don't give a damn what you think , I'm doin this for me . 
I know you don't mean to be mean to me ' Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong . \ 
Lately you make me feel all I am is a back-up plan . \ 
I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget everything I said . \ 
I buy into those eyes and into your lies 
You pick me up , you knock me down . You turned my whole life around . Since I saw you the first time . Heart to heart , lift me up . S.O.S. I'm so in love 
:( ...... : ? ..... :( 
haha soooo true ! \When\ 
\And all you do is let me down\ 
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\ 
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away\ 
You never did give a damn thing hunny but I cried for you , \ 
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died for you . 
Say you're sorry , that face of an angel comes out just when you need it to , \ 
As I pace back and forth all this time cause I honestly believed in you . 
And I'll be begging you , baby . Beg you not to leave . \ 
But I'll be left here waiting with my Heart on my sleeve . 
wants to find something good to do this weekend ! 
I need you in my arms , need you to hold . You're my world , my heart , my soul , \ 
If you ever leave , How do I ever , ever survive without you ? 
I need you in my arms , need you to hold . You're my world , my heart , my soul , If you ever leave , How do I ever , ever survive without you ? 
I run to you baby\ 
And when it all starts coming undone\ 
Baby you're the only one I run to\ 
I run to you <3 ilyds 
\The richest love is that which lasts through time apart to someday be together . \"" 
Love never dies a natural \ 
death . It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source . \ 
It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals . It dies of illness and \ 
wounds ; it dies of weariness , of withering , of tarnishing . 
Love is giving someone the power to destroy you ... but trusting them not to . 
Every time we say goodbye , I wish we had one more kiss . I'll wait for you I promise you , I will . Lucky I'm in love with my best friend . 
\Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin ' . And I hope that I'm around to watch ' em knock you down \"" 
Where ? It don't matter , as long as we're goin'\ 
Somewhere together . I've got a quarter . \ 
Heads , < PROPFEMALE > Tails , California . \ 
We can drive for a day , and then we'll take a look at the map . 
Giving blood tomorrow :) then volunteering at the animal shelter :) 
But you know I'd do anything for you . I would go through all this pain , Take a bullet straight through my brain . Yes , I would die for ya baby ; But you won't do the same . 
In the end , it's not going to matter how many breaths you took , but how many moments took your breath away 
You think roses are a waste of time\ 
cuz in three day they just wilt up and die , \ 
We want em anyway . \ 
I't a girl thing . \ 
You think we're pretty at the break of < PROPFEMALE > , \ 
when we wake up without our make up on\ 
we turn the other way . it's a girl thing 
Thank you for everything veterans ! :) 
so happy it's the weekend and my wonderful boyfriend is home :) <3 
When I say I'ma do somethin I do it . I don't give a damn what you think , I'm doin this for me . 
Now baby I believe this is real , So take a < PROPMALE > and don't ever look back <3 
\The tragedy of life isn’t that it ends too soon 
\Some women choose to follow men 
\you can tell me that your sorry but i don't believe you baby 
As long as I got eyes , I'll have a sight for you . \ 
Long as I am alive baby I'd die for you . I wanna be with you

Meet me in the pouring rain\ 
Kiss me on the sidewalk\ 
Take away the pain 
\come back to me like you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside ' till I came out . I just want it back the way it was before And I just want to see you back at my front door \"" 
\I still remember the look on your face\ 
You have pointed out my flaws again as if I don't already see them . all you're ever going to be is mean 
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would ... \ 
\You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin ' but I kinda know that I won't get far \"" 
The stakes are high , the water's rough . But this love is ours 
Now that it's raining more than ever , Know that we'll still have each other . You're part of my entity , here for Infinity . 
Goin to Toledo tomorrow morning ! can't wait , ilyds :) <3 
Great weekend at Toledo with my < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > <3

\Giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down . Could've loved you all my life If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold \"" 
\All I wanted was for you to Fight for me and Love me when I needed it most but instead you turned way while still claiming to love me yet doing nothing about it still . \ " \ " So why'd you make me fall if you didn't plan to catch me ? \""

If your Mom ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ) was a hard working woman & is your hero , helped you no matter how bad you were or is just the best Mom ever , if you are blessed to still have her or if she is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status & let everyone know you are PROUD of your Mother . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one Mom ! ?. 
Forever can never be long enough for me\ 
To feel like I've had long enough with you
