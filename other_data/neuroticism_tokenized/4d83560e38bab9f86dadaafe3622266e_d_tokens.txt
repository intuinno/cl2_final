I just got back from a great visit home to Wisconsin . Only two down sides . 1 ) It ended . 2 ) My nieces made me cry . 

< PROPFEMALE > and I just watched a movie - Answer Man . < PROPMALE > Daniels and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( Gilmore Girls ) . It was quite good . Some ?? language , so ... ( nothing the Navy didn't teach me , I'm afraid . ) . 
\I don't own any armor and I might not be that brave . You might be the one I rescue but I'll be the one you save . \ " Couldn't Love You More ; Whisper & Scream - < PROPMALE > McCain " 
\I can't escape myself . So many times I've lied . But there's still rage inside . Somebody get me through this nightmare . I can't control myself . - Animal I Have Become / One X - Three Days Grace " 
We all must seek the solice meant for us individually . I know it may be hard to endure , but the M&M's will understand and accept it . ( If they run , stab them . ) 
\Heartless-Heartless ! He thinks it's so cool to be cold . Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul . \ " Heartless / Magazine - Heart " 
\Here come the world With the look in its eye Future uncertain but certainly slight Look at the faces Listen to the bells It's hard to believe we need a place called hell . \ " Devil Inside / Kick - INXS " 
Dr. < PROPMALE > Frankenstein : For the experiment to be a success , all of the body parts must be enlarged . Inga : His veins , his feet , his hands , his organs vould all have to be increased in size . Dr. < PROPMALE > Frankenstein : Exactly . Inga : He vould have an enormous schwanzstucker . Dr. < PROPMALE > Frankenstein : That goes without saying . Inga : Voof . Igor : He's going to be very popular . - Young Frankenstein

Are we living in the United States of < PROPFEMALE > ... or are we living in a State of Exsanguination ? Ask yourself whom is holding the needle . 
New guilty pleasure , < PROPFEMALE > Keys . A beautiful voice and piano , quite nice I must say . 
Just watching the Tournament of < PROPFEMALE > s parade preceding the < PROPFEMALE > Bowl game . Has anyone ever seen what happens when a TCU Horned Toad goes walking down a road ....??? IT GETS RUN OVER BY A WISCONSIN BADGER !!!! 
Finding it nearly painful to watch football today . 
Seize every moment . 
This Republic was founded by the Framers of our Constitution so that Congressional reprentation would act on BEHAVE of it's constituent , NOT IN SPITE OF THEM . They have bestowed themselves privileges not allowed by the Constitution under the mask of \for our good . \ " We only have OURSELVES to blame for this . This Republic requires citizen to be involved and have a voice . To everyone : Make your voice heard . " 
\It takes a long time to grow an old friend . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > \ " It takes the risk of being seen as foolish to find a new one . \ " - < PROPMALE > ( Oh look .. I wax so poetic after only one cup of coffee . LOL ) " 
Thought of the day : Never regret a single day . Be thankful for finding a new old friend . ( you know who you are . ) E 
Met < PROPFIRST > on St. < PROPFEMALE>'s , walk through < PROPMALE > . 
Why was a moment when moments are all we share .

In loving memory of every cancer patient , family , and friends who have lost their battle with cancer and the ones who continue to conquer it .

Computer's suck , hard drive crash , back-up failure . Spending the last two days trying to reload all the music of my #$#%#^#$ years . LOL . Playlists pheonix slowly rising from the ashes . Invent as crashless computer system and the world will beat a path to your door . E 
A good day with sunshine , cherished that . Any doubt of my skill as a pool player have been erased , I THOROUGHLY SUCK at pool . Good class today , black belt twisted my arms and legs to the point of a chiropractic procedure , soooo painful but really cool . Riding the wave of a good inner high . E 
The vengeful strike of another good day again yesterday , few lows and many highs . The brutal lash of morning has struck with a biting sting but I continue to hold fast . 
TO ALL THE MOTHERS . ( No , not meant derogatorily ) . \ 
\ 
You are to be commended as the compassionate shapers of our collective \ 
future and as the one and only soul that could make all things better \ 
for each of us when no one else could . \ 
To my Mom , thank you for always being there to pick me up when I'd \ 
fallen , literally and spiritually . All my love , gratitude and infinite \ 
respect . E 
Does anyone know when spring or summer are supposed to come to Colorado . May 12th with three inches of snow on the lawn . It's crazy days . 
I've worked the last four Sunday's in a row . Do you think God doesn't want me coming to his house ? OMG !!! ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , ironic ) . 
Watched Ghost Town again . That movie rocks . T'ea < PROPFEMALE > is hot and < PROPMALE > Gervais is funny as h*ll . Not a bad way to pass some late night hours in an empty building . 
Watched Last of the Mohicans for the bazillionth time . Fantastic movie , everything a viewer could need , history , drama , action , romance , wilderness . Chingachgook is the most BAD ASS at the end . Move aside < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
\Have you given up on passion living day to day\ 
\I've seen a love that rolls like thunder\ 
\The smile on your face could sacrifice salvation . \"" 
Just returned from CO Rockies vs . SF Giants game , Rockies won 6 - 3 in a real fun game . Awesome fireworks show afterward . Attended with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > & Zshael ( her school friend ) . \ 
During the game , the following quotes actually occurred . \ 
Zshael - \Have you ever wondered if the dollar bills in your wallet have ever been in a strippers butt crack ? \""

I question whether we should be allowed out in public again . Saving Abel\ 
concert in Greeley on Saturday night . ROCK !!! 
Buckcherry & Saving < PROPMALE > concert at Greeley was awesome ! Both shows were great . If you get a < PROPMALE > , check out Buckcherry's song - Crazy Bitch . Really fun song , but pretty explicit . Lots of fun with a live crowd though . 
“I wanted a perfect ending . Now I’ve learned , the hard way , that some \ 
poems don’t rhyme , and some stories don’t have a clear beginning , \ 
middle , and end . Life is about not knowing , having to change , taking the\ 
moment and making the best of it , without knowing what’s going to \ 
happen next . ” ~ Gilda Radner 
Lady Astor to < PROPMALE > Churchill at a dinner party . \

Checked out their performance dates and go see them . You'll be glad you did . 
Early this morning , submitted my votes in the Colorado Primary Election . ( Balloted < PROPFEMALE>'s as well . ) It would be hypocritical of me to complain about the course of this Republic , State and community if I did not tender my direct influence on it's elected officials . \ 
Beside , this way I know which one to shake like a Rottweiler with rag doll when things don't turn around . \ 
Participate ... Vote . 
How many of us remember reciting the Pledge of Allegiance ( to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > ) as children in elementary school . I do . See if you can remember the whole thing . As a child it seemed to be more of a memory exercise . It has taken on so much more meaning since then , for me . E

Had a fantastic , super , great visit with family and friends for a couple weeks . Back in Colorado . 18 hours of driving alone , butt tired . Some serious snow while driving through Iowa provided an excuse for a nap in the truck . Already miss them and can't wait to return . Love you all . E 
\Once abolish the God 
Exhausted and exhilarated !!! Today , < PROPFIRST > ( my daughter ) and I tested for and were awarded our Black Belt by Kyoshi Weekley of the Ninpiden dojo here in Colorado . It was extremely challenging , mentally and physically . \

Now , it's time for a hot bath cuz I'm wrecked . E
