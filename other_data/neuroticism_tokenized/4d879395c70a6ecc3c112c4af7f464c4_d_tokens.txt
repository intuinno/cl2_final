It's kinda sad to think about the future . Adults are always telling you to live your life as a kid and teenager cuz it's only gonna get harder . What if it's hard already ? What if u already are loaded up with stress and adults r telling you right now is the best time of life and it's only gonna get worse ? Why does life work out this way ? Life just isn't fair I guess and we just have to deal with it . :(

Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross . They only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request ? : Is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education week and this is in honor of special needs children . 
I'm sorry if i have made u mad . But u have no idea what its like to be an exchange student until u actually are one . so please just forgive me for my mistakes . i have a lot on my shoulders and i never meant to hurt anybody . i am a human too and i do make mistakes . i wanna be like the nice monkey that helps u pick bugs out of ur hair not the mean monkey that chucks their banana at you . 
Mom- u only use 5% of ur brain . The rest 95% of it is flapping around in the wind . 
Ok I tried to translate this to < PROPMALE > but it just was too hard . I need to express myself fully . \ 
I feel like a puppy running through the daisies on a cool summers day . The wind ruffling my little tail and I bark as I get excited . Now that I have softball again . 
I hate Tuesdays . 
Today is the anniversary of < PROPFEMALE > harbor . Never forget . 
I love being able to speak two languages somewhat goodly . For example : when < PROPFEMALE > is sitting breathing over my shoulder watching my every move on my laptop I can start typing in English and she doesn't understand anything except that her name is on the screen and then she wonders what I am writing . Haha love you < PROPFEMALE > . 
Wow , thank you God for giving Minnesota a ton of snow right when I'm on a little trip to Germany ! Not a happy camper , but then again I did get to eat off of a hot stone tonight . exotic ....

Feels like a loser . Looks like a loser . Acts like a loser . I just am a loser that doesn't belong . And I've known that for a while now . 
I find it amazing when Germans sing happy birthday . It seriously makes my day . 
Exactly 6 months today , that I've been away from everything I know . And exactly 6 months today , that I have taken to get to know 2 wonderful families . And I can't believe that it's been 6 months . Not one bit . 
Ok . So I decided the first place I'm going to when I get back to the US is IHOP . 
STEELERS .
