Desandnate are amazing . xD 
Couple more questions on this worksheet then I'm getting some much needed sleep . Good night . :D 
Oh my God , I just saw Colonel Sanders walking his two dogs on the side of the road next to my house ! O.O 
Suicide Silence + Mountain Dew + < PROPMALE>'s Mod = Great night 
So ... BrokeNCYDE did a version of Teach me how to Dougie ... Teach me how to Scream . xD It's actually not half-bad . 
Just got done watching Bleach : Fade to Black . Bedtime . :D <3 
Derp . 
To Move on is to Grow - We Came as Romans <3 
Even the blind have seen my blasphemies . 
Going to bed early( ? xD ) , night guise . <3 
Pretty great weekend . \ 
Plus me and my dad are getting along . \ 
Time to play Halo : Reach all night . :D 
Lmfao , I just found a great way to boost credit gain in Reach . \ 
Thanks Youtube . <3 
Just got a couple < PROPFIRST > Mayer , Maroon 5 , and Coldplay songs . Oh yeah . :P \ 
Time for bed . 
Going to get my braces tightened , crap . x.x ' 
Back from the appointment . I hate the anticipation for the pain to set in . xD 
I'll bite the bullet just to save myself . 
Fuuuuck , that nasal spray people use to clear sinuses hurts so bad ! >.> 
It's not about what you've done . It's all about what you'll become . 
Just played through Reach on Heroic for the first time . \ 
The ending = amazing and sad 
The tears that stain my cheek must make me look weak , but I wear them proudly . 
All That Remains's new album is out . :D 
Hopefully going to school tomorrow . \ 
Hopefully dreaming of her ... <3 
My dad won't get up , what the fuck . \ 
I guess another day of school that I'm out ... ugh . 
* puts on V mask * 
So Suicide Silence has all new shirts out . \ 
Fuck . xD 
Broadway - AWOL <3 \ 
I fell in love with the lead singer's voice . 
Attempting to play through Reach on Legendary with skulls on . \ 
I'm a gambling man . 
Going to bed . \ 
I hope he's ok ... 
Working . 
>.> 
Motionless in White's new album = the jizz 
Your eyes are labyrinths of lies . 
Oh my God , Motionless in White did a cover of Dragula by < PROPMALE > Zombie . o.o 
I know that there's nothing real inside . Your heart's invested in feeding everyone lies . 
Finally getting tired , time for some sleep . 
Just picked up Fallout : New Vegas . 
We're young and in love ; Heart attacks waiting to happen . So come a little closer , and tell me those three little words . 
Everyone try to wear an article of purple clothing tomorrow . 
Ugh ... 
Finally found the good version of Pray by Blessthefall . 
Good thing tomorrow is a half day . 
Dies irae , dies < PROPFEMALE > lacrymosa qua resurget ex fav < PROPFEMALE > . Quantus tremor est futurus . Iudicantus , homo reus ergo parce . 
Atrox was amazing . There's a reason why it's ranked 5th in the nation . Definitely going to it next year . 
Just got done helping my dad . I wrecked my leg . xD 
Lol , a Bear Grylls meme . 
You've got my back against the wall . I've got my hands around your throat . 
This is what we are . 
Fallout : New Vegas <3 
Lmfao , school days just get more and more interesting . I've washed my hands clean , and it feels surprisingly great . 
Holy crap , Sniper Rifles on New Vegas are powerful . o.o 
Downloading . Hack themes . :D 
So , I'm not ready for the Legendary Deathclaw yet . 
Don't act like you don't know exactly what you really are . 
Dear Ms. Larsen , \ 
\ 
Thank you for not accepting my final rough draft today . I get to spend a lovely hour and thirty minutes in ICU just because you have a tampon jammed up your vagina . \ 
Thank you , \ 
< PROPMALE > 
Sheeeeet . 
Tomorrow will be better . Things were said and done , but everything is fine now . 
Pretty good day . ICU was so fun , thanks to < PROPMALE > . <3 xD 
6 levels away from maxing out my first Fallout : New Vegas character . \ 
Play Time : 36:53:36 
I'm deleting my Facebook and Myspace to keep myself from expressing my opinion about Brewer and/or it's teachers . Feel free to say your goodbyes to me because I'll be keeping this Facebook up until Sunday at around 3pm . If you want to text me , my number is 256-783-6931 . Somehow my opinion had alerted faculty at Brewer because they have \insiders . \"" 
What was a joke has turned into a horrible situation and I am paying dearly for my inability to express myself in a better fashion on a public website . Sorry guys , have a good one . 
To everyone who's supporting me , thank you . <3 
Everyone , there is a POSSIBILITY that I am getting charges pressed against me . As for suing , I'm not sure how it got out that I am . Anyways , I'm pretty sure if they would even try to < PROPFEMALE > me , Facebook would intervene and take my side of things . I was told that the principle of Brewer had talked to attorneys on the matter and said if they really wanted to , they could . Apparently I'm getting let off ' easy ' though ? 
After talking with several different friends , I've come to learn of an organization called the ACLU ( American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama ) , that I WILL be contacting because I feel my rights as a human being were violated . 
Once again , I thank everyone for their support on what the high school is trying to pull on me . To everyone who has made shirts , that means so much to me . <3 
Guys , I've been thinking about the Free < PROPMALE > shirts and everything ; While I REALLY appreciate that everyone is supporting me through this , think about what could happen to you all that are participating . Technically this is a form of protesting , but you can only protest on public land , NOT private . Schools are private property owned by the government . 
So in all honesty , they could actually take legal action against the protesters . So PLEASE don't get yourselves into trouble over me . On top of that , they could charge me with inciting a riot on private grounds , which would get me expelled and for sure taken legal action against . Like I said , I appreciate and love all who have my back , but please , think about your own well-being . 
Alright guys , the shirts need to stop . It's getting out of hand . 
Xbox LIVE has a totally new layout ? Wut ? 
Everyone who has Xbox LIVE ( excluding the ones that commented in my other status ) , post your gamertags . :P Mine is O0 K1llJ0Y 0O . If you have Reach , I'd be glad to play you a couple matches . 
To move on is to grow . 
1 . ) Go to Google Maps\ 
2 . ) Go to \Get Directions\ " \ 
Punk Goes Pop Volume 3 is out , listen to it ! > : U 
Escape the Fate's new album is out . The Aftermath ( The Guillotine Pt . 3) <3 
So , Escape the Fate's new album is so-so . The Aftermath ( G3 ) is the best song by far . 
It seems like depression fuels my insomnia whenever I'm in ISS . I'm so exhausted , but I know I won't have a good sleep . :| 
Two-pound steaks aint got shiz on me , umad vegetarians ? 
So I figured out who told on me . I won't say any names , but you know who you are . :) 
Ok what the hell , Hug a Tall Person Day is one day before my birthday ? 
I wish I was Lt . Colonel already so I can get Kat's robotic arm . :| 
Last day of ISS tomorrow . Then Friday I'll be back at regular school . \ 
At least I don't have ICU on top of ISS , lol . 
Great , so I didn't set my alarm clock this morning and got up late and got another day added on to ISS . So I'll be back to regular school monday ... fml . 
< PROPMALE > just got hired on at 3M , he'll be making $25 an hour . I'm so happy for him . :D 
Ugh , damn you 3M . >:| 
Time to get Reach's daily challenges out of the way . 
is wondering whether to get Black Ops for PC or 360 . 
This is the last time I raise a fist to fight . Reach out your hands to me and let's just disappear . 
Actually tired , and might get some sleep before 4am in the morning ? Wtffff . 
Fun weekend . \ 
I'm actually looking forward to school tomorrow . xD 
Normal school tomorrow , yay . : ' D 
Just hit level 30 in New Vegas , and just hit 1.5 M caps . Time for bed . 
Went to the orthodontist and got my braces tightened , and a new color for the ' chain ' . I may have to get surgery for my bottom jaw , fml . 
Tomorrow shall be a monumental day . 
/jealousofthepeoplegoingtothemidnightreleaseofBlackOps 
I want to hold your hand so tight I'm going to break my wrist . 
I hope today's a fast day . xD 
About to pull an all-nighter on Black Ops , shit just got serious . 
Well , just hit level 23 on Black Ops . Time for bed . xD 
Today should be fun . 
Another night dedicated to countless hours of Black Ops . <3 
Bed . Full day of Black Ops tomorrow . Hopefully reaching level 40-45 . xD 
I'm tired of this bullshit , god damn it . 
Getting all the pro versions of perks can be a < PROPMALE > annoying . >.> 
The Crossbow on Black Ops is fun as hell . xD 
Finally got all my the perks I use to pro . Hit level 37 also . Two hours of sleep ftw . o.O 
Planning on hitting my first prestige tonight on Black Ops . 
Just had my best game of Black Ops yet . \ 
18/2 
Eh , got to level 49 . Too lazy to get it tonight . xD 
You built the walls that kept you alone . I tore them down just to watch you rebuild . You built this house to hide from everything you feared . I nearly showed you how to tear that building down . 
Trolololololololololololololololololololo 
Oh my God ... I haven't been this sick in a while ... :| 
is surprised people don't use Tactical Insertions on Capture the Flag . o.O 
Played several hours of Black Ops with < PROPMALE > , got A Day to Remember's new album , and I'm feeling better . Pretty good day , and tomorrow I'll be back at school . Oh , and to anyone who has it , I have ICU . :o 
Saw Deathly Hallows Pt . 1 . The part where they cut it off made me want to scream \FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU -\"" 
I can't stop listening to 2012 by The Word Alive over and over . \ 
1st prestige level 34 , planning on getting to 1st prestige level 40 tonight . 
I've messed up . I can't fix it . I'm just going to bear it . Fuck my life . 
2nd Sucks by A Day to Remember <3 
Jesus Christ , I hate how kids on Youtube are more worried about what type of label you are rather than the music you listen to . Anyone can listen to any type of music , as long as you're supporting the band . A type of music isn't restricted to one type of person , gah . /rant 
I have never been so consumed , and I have never loved it more . To be devoted to letting all see what it is to live in the love of others . To live in the love of my brothers , and spilling back all that has ever been spilled for me . To show that to those who have never seen . 
My phone is screwed up , great . I can't send text messages or call people . 
Went walking in the rain for 3 hours . I had to get out of the house . Got kicked out at 9 in the morning . Hooray for pity ? 
This drama is ending ... no more . 
One shot to forgetting , and six shots to falling in the end . 
realizes how much he actually loves Goldfish , mainly because they're the snack that smiles back . 
Currently ranked 39,667 in Black Ops Free-for-all . 
Thanksgiving battle plan :\ 
1 . ) Attack the turkey legs head-on , cutting off movement and leaving the turkey fortress vulnerable to later attacks . \ 
2 . ) Decimate the stuffing , causing the other foods to constantly lose morale . \ 
3 . ) Assassinate the mashed potatoes by drowning it in gravy . \ 
4 . ) If ham reinforcements verge on my location , easily tear them apart . \ 
5 . ) Waddle to headquarters and proceed to tell tales of the battle . 
A deep conversation , great food , and a bunch of smiling faces . \ 
This has been a great Thanksgiving . 
About to start second prestige . 
Time for leftovers . * twiddles fingers * 
Well , off to bed . I'll be sure to wake up in a couple hours and turn it to the news and hear of assault/homicide charges because of Black Friday . 
I won't give up on you . These scars won't tear us apart . So don't give up on me . 
Asking < PROPFEMALE>'s new album is coming out 12/21/10 , and the music video for A Prophecy is coming out soon . 
Well damn . 
Bad flooding is bad . \ 
Couldn't even get to Brewer because of it . 
Your words aren't enough , I need to see more . Put down the sword and shed the armor . 
Decided to get back into emulators . Metroid and Final Fantasy III . <3 
Whyyyyy can't people mind their own business . 
Sleep . I doubt we'll be getting out/delayed/let out early tomorrow . 
Signed up for volunteer work at Country Corner Cafe on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > to help feed the less fortunate , I can't wait . :D 
Super Metroid <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3 
Disregard all your flaws and prepare for conclusion . We are all ungrateful , complaining to ourselves . We crawl out from beneath insecurity . I hate this process . 
School needs to hurry by today . 
Going to get my braces tightened , then heading to school . 
Well , I /ragequit after dieing to Kraid three times . \ 
Time for Black-Ops . 
Cover your eyes , forget what you see . Go west young man , and let the evil go east . 
The sun and the < PROPFEMALE > , you'll always take them for granted . What's delicate is lost . As the selfish forget what is sacred , the humble forget themselves . 
Never again will I go to /b/ , never again . 
I keep my head above the water while they drown in the undertow . 
Playing some Final Fantasy 5 . \ 
This makes me happy . xD 
Cleaning up my Grandparents ' old house . Moving into it early summer . 
3rd prestige . >.> 
With faith , some minds are sand ; but I prefer concrete . 
Ohmygod , I can't wait for Dead Space 2 . 
wishes they didn't cancel school . 
On the prowl for a Diablo II download , if anyone knows where I can get it , please do share . 
What if I can't forget you ? I'll burn your name into my throat . I'll be the fire that'll catch you . 
Downloading Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XIII . :3 \ 
I've been nostalgia'ing with Final Fantasy for several days now . 
Behind every mask lies a man who can't live in his own skin . He lives by the flask and bathes in the past , and he dies by his own sins . 
So , A Skylit Drive's new album comes out one day after < PROPFIRST>'s Day , can't wait . 
Time to play Chrono Trigger for the rest of the night . 
Ugh , throat is killing me and I'm congested . Hooray . 
Diablo II . :3 
Murder the man who devoured your god , for these hands like houses will protect you from the storm . 
Scream with the voice of an angel . Lie in the eyes of a gospel . Smile in the face of your victims , smile for me . 
Now I see that this is what you mean when you said you'd be my everything , so go and prove your loyalty . 
Hmmmm , I've been lacking Emarosa , definitely need to go find some of their music . \ 
/scuttlesoff 
Have I ever found myself in your favor , or was it all just a temporary covering ? When the seas become calm and the winds have all been settled will I still see your love ? 
Eh , nothing to do but wait for tomorrow so I'm off to bed . 
Today should be great . 
So I saw < PROPFIRST > play Fable 3 and it made me want to play it pretty badly . 
Modern Warfare > Black Ops 
Breathless bodies raise their fists into the air . These circles of hatred are all we will ever see . 
< PROPFIRST > Fiasco + Pepsi + Black Ops = Great night . 
I miss being a little kid when you actually got excited for Christmas ... oh well . Memories are fine too . :D 
Last-minute Christmas shopping , great . xD 
Ugh ... done . My legs hurt . I saw < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > at Wal-Mart , which was amazing . :D \ 
Oh , and my brother got a Stoeger shotgun ... * never messes with < PROPMALE > again * 
I believe I just had the best dinner of my life . \ 
Steak , lobster , crab , and ribs . :o 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas . :3 
Ok , I'm not going to waste my time going around to everyone's wall posting < PROPFEMALE > Christmas based on the fact that I am VERY lazy . \ 
But I hope everyone has a fun-filled and memorable Christmas . \ 
Opening presents at 6am . <3 
* Waits for WoW's 7.1 GB download to finish * FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU- 
So I'm checking out my mom's Nook . Shit is so cash . XD 
It just started snowing ... again . :o 
Show me your hands , let me wash them clean . 
Listening to Parkway Drive , and playing some World of Warcraft . Feels good , man . 
Actually looking forward to school tomorrow , even though I don't know my schedule . 
Yeah .... didn't get any sleep . Oh well , I'll just take a nap after school . 
School was ok . \ 
6th period is going to turn out rather ... interesting . \ 
She already hates me , lmfao . xD 
Try to numb the pain with alcohol and pills , but it won't repair your trust . You can't stand on two fucking feet with a substance as a crutch . 
5:30 am , I'm somewhat tired . 
Screw your snow pictures . 
Listening to themes from The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time and playing World of Warcraft . Like a boss . 
Another day to add to this awesome ' blizzard break . ' 
So apparently < PROPFIRST > Carlile is BACK with Of Mice & Men . 
He needs to change ? Obviously you're ignorant to what you are . He deserves better . 
You've been to hell and back , so what am I supposed to do ? 
Can't wait for Dead Space 2 and Dead Space : Aftermath . 
Well , court at nine . Then I'm off to school . 
Horrible day . \ 
Sick to my stomach , and I just want to sleep . 
Does fabrication begin at belief ? 
Snow ... \ 
Y U NO GO AWAY ?! 
Someone mind telling me if we're delayed tomorrow or not ? 
Falling in Reverse needs to go ahead and come out with an album already so they can stomp Escape the Fate . 
I'm crazy . 
Don't look now , but they're watching . 
Falling in Reverse plans on releasing two albums very soon , a hardcore one and a pop one . Altogether < PROPFIRST > has 55 songs ready . Holy balls . 
My Ticket Home is doing a cover of Firework by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . xD 
is pro at screwing things up . 
All are equal in love and trust . 
All because of you , I believe in angels . Not the kind with wings . No , not the kind with halos . The kind that bring you home , when home becomes a strange place . I'll follow your voice . All you have to do is shout it out . 
13 days until A Skylit Drive's new album comes out . x.x ' 
If I'm < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , You're < PROPFEMALE > Hepburn . 
GUISE LOOK IT'S SNOWING AGAIN AMAGAWD 
This is not what it is , only baby scars . I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side . 
This is what we were made for . Every day I live this future . 
Finally tired . 
is not watching the Superbowl 
Has gotten < PROPMALE > Charest addicted to WoW . :) 
I guess I'm going to be the one to point this out ... Why do girls ALWAYS stick their tongues out in 3/4 of their pictures ? I'm baffled and I've yet to find an explanation for this . 
needs to take sleeping pills , srsly . 
Sick , freaking great . 
Braces are hurting me + sickness = Yeeeeeeeeeee . 
has just made a Human Priest on WoW named Jesusheals . 
Hmmmm , three days . 
A blank canvas will later be priceless , and the love that we build will be endless . Though we all stumble , we will not fall . 
Hasn't played Counterstrike in a while , and is going to go do so . 
Tomorrow is hug a tall person day ? \ 
Crap . 
Just got back from the mall with a couple friends . Me and Keanun got hit on , and it was awkward ... 
We all have our horrors and our demons to fight , but how can I win when I'm paralyzed ? They crawl up on my bed , wrap their fingers ' round my throat . Is this what I get for the choices that I made ? 
I'm pretty sure this was the worst birthday weekend I've ever had . \ 
Thanks though to everyone who wished me happy birthday . 
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes . 
So , it turns out some girls have no respect for their bodies . \ 
You'll be worn out in two or three years , and you'll lose all your so called friends . Then you'll rot . :D 
I'll be damned before you ruin his happiness . 
Tomorrow's going to be fun . :) \ 
Bed time . 
It's time to see the bastard you've become , because I know your father didn't raise you this way . The apple doesn't fall far from the tree . :) 
Whaaaaaat ? There's a genre of music called Brocore ? \ 
I lol'ed . 
I fucked up , big time . 
Does anyone know the assignment for Mrs. Larsen ? The 3 essay questions about Macbeth ? If so , please do share . 
^has come to the realization he has a lot he needs to change to better himself . 
I hope tomorrow will go by ... fast . \ 
I won't be back at school until Monday , and it sucks . :\\\ 
Bed time ... 
Lawl , guise I got a haircut . 
^finds it hilarious when he beats boosters at a game of FFA in MW2 . :) 
I've seen this all before . We should be everything we could be . If only you could see how much you mean to me . 
4:30 am , and I'm finally tired . :) 
Tonight should be fun . :D 
If you call me at all , don't tell me that I'm ordinary . 
700 more likes until Make Me Famous releases two more songs . >.< 
Sleep . 
Lol . 
Make Me Famous <----- They're so close to releasing two more songs , just need to hit 10k likes and they do . 
We all know , we all know by now that you're the only thing you talk about . 
100 more likes , ugh this is killing me . xD 
Make Me Famous reached 10k likes , now comes the grueling wait for the songs to be posted . 
Good day was good . 
I never believed in you , from what I see it was justified . 
Trolling is getting boring , oh well . 
-.- 
You say you need a greater purpose . I say you need to see what's coming . 
Lol @ druggies 
No one will get this right ! \ 
My middle name__________ , my age___ , my favorite soda_______ , my full\

I think I'll just wash my hands clean of that situation ... 
You never said that this would be easy . So go on , live . 
I'm pretty sure Dead Space 2 is the scariest game I've ever played . 
Whitechapel + Modern Warfare 2 = Yeeeeeee . 
The things people can do with Minecraft is totally ridiculous . 
They can't fool us anymore . We're far too clever . 
You won't remain . 
^has just encountered his first exploding baby on Dead Space 2 . 
We'll never fall if we stand for something . 
Although we have no obligation to stay alive , on broken backs we beg for mercy . We will survive . 
^sucks at Frisbee . 
Craigslist meetings can be scary as balls , legit . 
I won't give up if you won't . 
Just went 33-2 on MW2 Derail . :) 
< PROPFIRST > Studer , thanks for getting me hooked on Before You Exit . :) 
The mindless are easily lured . 
Forever Alone is on the dollar < PROPMALE > , no joke . 
Great , no school for me today . :\\ 
* Puts on shades*\ 
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH 
You ask me why I'm so blue ? I've been holding my breath for you . 
This time your lies won't get you far . We know who you are . 
The new Rise Against album Endgame is out ! :) 
You think I'm weak ? It's called honesty . 
Off to bed . 
The game . 
Some people call it tragedy . I call it moving on . 
We are the sun and the sea and the mountain . We are the children who still can't believe . We have faith , we have hope , we have answers . In our hearts is where we are free . 
Sleeping with Sirens is dropping a new album May 10th . \ 
I . Can't . Wait . 
Listen up young hearts , this world is yours . Don't stop believing , even though you're scared . Have faith in yourself and I'll promise that these anchors won't pull us down . 
It's always darkest before the < PROPFEMALE > , so stay awake with me and let's prove them wrong . 
Maaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiizeee . 
Saw Rango last night , it was pretty amazing . :) 
\I hope you like the taste of prison food ... and penis . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE>'s a bitch , right ? 
Thanks < PROPMALE > Charest , for showing me the < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > d , and < PROPMALE > dy purgatory theory . Never again can I view that show the same . 
Seeing everyone's true face makes me wish they would keep their masks on . 
Lady Gaga and Modern Warfare 2 mix surprisingly great . 
The girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30 lbs . The boy you called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4 hrs a night . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying . 
Our vision for this world will not die when we are dead . 
Stay cold or you'll get caught in this deceiving old game . Extinguish that flame . 
Just got a new Sleeping with Sirens shirt . :) 
So this weekend was pretty awesome . 
\How the hell does he know to turn around every time ? He's modding obviously . \ " \ 
Under a cascade of stars , I gave you my heart . 
Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen . 
For goodness sake , let it fade away . Let go of the past that tore you apart . Embrace this < PROPMALE > for a brand new start . 
You are so far away , and it strains on me . 
* facepalm * 
Chairs thrown and tables toppled . Hands armed with broken bottles , standing no < PROPMALE > to win but we're not running , we're not running . 
My Make Me Famous shirt came in . :) \ 
Ending a crappy day on a good note . 
IT'S FRIDAY FRIDAY GOTTA GET DOWN ON FRIDAY . 
Best weekend I've had in a while . 
First night of Minecraft ... I spent it burrowed in the side of a mountain watching zombies and Skeleton Archers . xD 
Rumors and lies are all you've got . 
Encountered my first dungeon on Minecraft , lol . 
\Lonely hearts lose the battle every time . Kingdoms start with the closest of friends . Maybe I will write someday about how you all helped me get to where I am right now . I have you to thank and no one else . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > Man was such a good movie . 
Finally done with that Macbeth project . :) 
I begin to lift up my own flaws to better you . 
Oh me , oh my . 
HAY GUISE GESS WUT TOMORO IS 
Make Me Famous just got to 18k likes . They're releasing a music video for Make It Precious tomorrow . :) 
Ate at Shogun's and saw Hop yesterday . The weekends keep getting better and better . :) \ 
That > Prom 
Crysis 2 multi-player is actually really good . :)
