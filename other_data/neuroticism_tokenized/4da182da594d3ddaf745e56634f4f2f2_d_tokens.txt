is enjoying a warm , fresh-baked Ghirardelli brownie . Here's a tip : when the recipe calls for vegetable oil , use coconut oil . The flavor goes sooo well with chocolate !

A unionized public employee , a teabagger , and a CEO are sitting at a table . In the middle of the table there is a plate with a dozen cookies on it .
