~ Ghost Man ~ 
I grind but I'm not a hustler ... make my due the best way I can 
is so tired of being broke , tired of moving , tired of hustling , tired of grinding , tired of J.O.B.s , and tired of waiting for what I want ... I feel like I'm losing my passion for life and attaining happiness . I'm flat out tired ... hype me up 
So many negative things has happened , it's caused me to lose my motivation for happiness . I'll get by the best way I can . No one can make me feel special except for myself . 
If family doesn't boost me up , I always do myself . I'm a killa at Physical Testing , been that way since Elementry school . So good at being physical ... can't you tell . haha ;p 
~ Ghost Man ~ has emerged ... 
~ Ghost Man ~ holding on ... 
So much to do : Save $$/gain $$ , laundry , check into Starbucks , finish my website , schedule photo shoots , check up on places to live , STUDY ... and Dyl !! 
~ Ghost Man ~ rising/building 
Ghost Man focus ... intranced by the scent . 
too deep to understand , too tired to care , too anxious to see ... too beaten , too much for my own good . 
Always finds a way to make it through ... sleep always helps . 
Gravery ;p 
So amazed when someone actually seems to understand me , not surprised when others don't ... Ghost Man will fade , leave your influence before it's too late . 
No bandage , just give me some Neosporin and a help up ... 
Try to get through to this ... bring a < PROPFEMALE > drill and a flashlight , I'm lost . 
It's ALWAYS one thing after another : Money , car , a home , love ... trying to climb through ; smothered by life and trying to make sense of it all . 
one day at a time , eventually I'll get that feeling ... 
Damn , that thought felt good . That's the Dyl ... 
He's my Robitussin , feeling better already ... 
hoping and focusing on mine ... 
ready for some happy ... 
working through it all ... ~ Ghost Man ~ will fade in a matter of time , catch me while you still can ... 
just don't really care ... 
trying to figure things out . I just don't know anymore ... 
gravery ... I'm something kinda special 
I love the feeling of enlightenment ... better late than never I guess , we'll see 
To The T(ea ) Productions !! Holla at ya boy ... Man . ;p 
Finally got my priorities in check , sticking to my guns and being productive , and getting in touch with who I am and what path I have ahead of me ... love life , not love . Love loves you ... 
ready for something great 
doesn't really care anymore ... it's whatever . Wish that the world could adapt to me for a change . 
I'm goin in ... I'm going harder than ever ... take my hand * 
... just wait * 
... just wait ** 
I'm dying ... 
I'm lost , please find me ... 
need to feel free , not cheap . Make life worth living ... 
life isn't fair just full of events 
AAAHHH .. Fucking < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Time to man up ... I can't do everything by myself but it seems like I'll have to try ... 
I'm infectious ... ;[ 
recouping myself ... 
I see my life around me ... and grow to become a man . 
so much to do ... you hoes can't see me , go head and sleep on this like you always do ... 
sicker than ya average ... 
How should I be feeling , what should I feel ? Still sicka than ya average ... remember dat ! 
Sicka than you average ... pay homage * 
I live out my dream , literally ... are you in the path of my dreams ? Will you remain there and manifest more ... something kinda special * 
Ok , I know what I need to do now that I'm feelin better . I'mma bounce back with such sweetness . Go through the screens , check your bags , wait at the terminal and get ready to board this flight ... * Sweet Air * ... how ya like that metaphor ;p 
Ok , I know what I need to do now that I'm feelin better . I'mma bounce back with such sweetness . Go through the screens , check your bags , wait at the terminal and get ready to board this flight ... * Sweet Air * ... no crashin ;p 
Although you may be accused of being too shallow sometimes , no such possibility exists today . You are the one who is pushing for more meaning now and you want others to follow your lead . But even if they can see what brings you closer to your truth , it could lure them farther away from theirs . Don't expect anyone to follow your thinking ; just make certain that it's valid for you before you head out on your own . 
My dreams are so strong , eventually I'll shine brighter than anyone can see and have my own reality ... 
was used , disrespected then disgusted , but feels so amazingly AMPLIFIED . I never look back only remember ... 
is ready to live , feel , enjoy again ... lost but hoping for true happiness . 
sleep , sweet sweet sleep doesn't come easy , especially now . With such a strong imagination I'll have to find a great way to properly recharge ALL OF THIS and work it out ... and you know I WORK ! 
I just don't know ... but I make it happen ! < PROPFEMALE > will come around to my side eventually . 
I'm here for no ones entertainment but my own , pleasing you is just a BIG plus ! 
I only have room for special people in my life , I'm special and so are the ones that treat me that way . Not that hard to understand ... but if you don't , I really don't care . I'm open to true friends ... special friends . 
Oh My Damn ... Under Construction . ;p 
Great day for photo shoots and more to come . I'm lovin it , check out my ish when it's done . I love my days off ! ;p 
OH MY DAMN ... what power !! 
A < PROPFEMALE > MADE ME SCREAM !! It still echoes ... 
old habbits die hard ... 
numb to life and going through it ... waiting to get the feeling back and more . 
Wow , what a < PROPFEMALE > ! 
* Hitting the gym early like a < PROPFEMALE > before school then workin it at Starbucks ... I'm so feelin life right now ! * 
I don't < PROPMALE > my dreams ... I reach for the STARS * 
craves ecstacy ... desiring bliss in every way * 
is a special kind of guy ... 
totally dissatisfied with my life ... but extremely appreciate the T's and the Miss . I'mma do me and hopefully get some happy . 
My purpose is bigger than you can see ... even bigger than I can see . 
I'm a different kind of guy ... I have a < PROPMALE > , brain and a heart ... not to mention dreams and goals that reach the stars . 
Time to grind ... will you sweat with me ? I promise it will be sweet ; just learn to stand the heat . 
trying to deal with it all 
even on my days off I never get to have the day off ... stress reliever , take a nigga to the spa or sumn , just leave me in the bed ... 
I have to go to Shalimar courthouse today after 3pm , can anyone scoop me from OWC in Niceville ? 
* SUPERSTAR * I need to give myself more credit ... I'll love life again sooner or later .

Time to grind and get-r-done ... 
yeah , I got an interview tomorrow in Sandestin ... just gotta make it there at 2:30 pm 
life is complicated , watch me simplify ... 
When you become a new person , you should do new things ... better things that just feel right . 
stability , security , certainty ... and love . That's all I want . Dreams are fake , life is real ... reality seems like a joke at times . Why am I so deep and easily misunderstood ? I barely understand myself ... my life . 
I stay needing a ride ...!
