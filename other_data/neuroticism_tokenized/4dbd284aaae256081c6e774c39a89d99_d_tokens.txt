How I wish , how I wish you were here . \ 
We're just two lost souls\ 
Swimming in a fish bowl , \ 
Year after year , \ 
Running over the same old ground . \ 
What have we found ? \ 
The same old fears . \ 
Wish you were here . 
If the children don't grow up , \ 
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up . \ 
We're just a million little gods causin ' rain storms , \ 
turnin ' every good thing to rust . \ 
I guess we'll just have to adjust . 
I think I went overboard on my history essay . Don't hurt me .

Cheer up , < PROPFEMALE > , I hope you can\ 
There is something wrong with me\ 
My mind is filled with silvery stars\ 
< PROPFEMALE > , kisses , clouds of fog\ 
Shoulders shrugging off 
I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain'\ 
Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath\ 
But who are my real friends ? \ 
Have they all got the bends ? \ 
Am I really sinking this low ? 
They say a watched pot won't ever boil\ 
But I closed my eyes and nothing changed\ 
Just some water getting hotter in the flames
