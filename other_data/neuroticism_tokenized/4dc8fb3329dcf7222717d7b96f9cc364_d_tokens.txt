^___^ 
just needs to say : Columbia folks , never rent from Remi . Ever . >:| 
is excited for her GRA interview today ! 
is so used to work sites that she just typed facebook.missouri.edu and was confused when she got an error . 
was woken up by a surprise showing of her apartment . Apparently Remi left a voicemail 2 and a half hours prior and thought that was enough notice . 
graduation : so boring I'm on facebook . 
I wanted to think of a cute , witty status , but all I can think is , \IT'S SO DAMN HOT . \ " Anchorman quotes have been withheld for your sanity . " 
finally mustered the self control to turn off the Snapped marathon and what did she find ? A Law and Order SVU marathon . The universe is against her today . 
lolololol . 
Anybody in Columbia need a washer/dryer for a year ? My new place comes with them and I'm too cheap to pay for storage for mine . 
is ready for a nap , and then a roadtrip . 
is sooooooooo excited to have a niece in November . :)

Thanks for the birthday wishes , everyone ! :)

can't really do any work while the network is down . Hello , facebook . :) 
should be asleep . 
is baking the cutest cupcakes ever . Husband is an excellent at icing starburst . 
Tonight's agenda : Yoshi eggs and Katamari balls . More pictures will be taken . 
< PROPFIRST > will be one year old on Tuesday ! ^_^ 
Okay , I lied . I'm totally buying a cake and a present for < PROPFIRST>'s birthday . Also , I have put her name into the Pinkberry song . C-H-I , B-U-R , G-E-R , < PROPFIRST > BURGER ! Top that , other crazy cat ladies . 
class class class , grad school is a pain in the ... butt . 
loves it when < PROPFEMALE > snores . 
is it hot in here , or is it my nightly glass of wine ? 
I should write , but instead I think I'll lie here pitifully on the couch and watch < PROPFEMALE > play video games . 
I left my book at home . Now I'm dying . 
I know I shouldn't be , but I am strangely intrigued by the \Hipster Ninjas Attack ! \ " ad . " 
I got money in the bank whatchoo think about that . 
Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , for getting every creepy Japanese children's song known to man stuck in my head . Why Japan be puttin ' demons in everything !? 
I like it on the wall . 
The more I watch < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > play FF8 , the more I regret not renaming < PROPFIRST > \Vaginal \"" 
is queer and National Coming Out Day is tomorrow . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and only five states plus DC recognize that love , not gender , is what matters in a marriage . Donate your status and join me by clicking here : http://bit.ly/9iwTBG . 
is super duper gay and celebrating National Coming Out Day . The HRC < PROPFEMALE > is being a giant douchebag so I have to make up my own message . Umm , don't be a hater and feel free to show your support through cookies and cash . And if you're thinking of being an asshole , my mom has threatened to kick your butt if you give me any trouble . That's legit . 
If you ever wondered what a Japanese cover of Kansas would sound like , here's a hint : bad . 
REMEMBER THAT TIME I ACCIDENTALLY SPAMMED MY WHOLE CONTACTS LIST WITH GOODREADS ? Yeah , that was awesome . Ignore that , plz . 
Welcome to the world , < PROPFEMALE > :) 
has her purple on :) 
ILS VENDOR REVIEWWWWW ! * rage claws * 
Why , whenever I try to focus on my paper , do I suddenly hear , \I WHIP MAH HAIR BACK AND FORTH\ " ? I don't even like that song !! " 
I hope the entire world is ready to hear me SCREAMING at the Supernatural episode this week . 
SUPERNATURAL TOMORROW WITH < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
I'm glad I'm not doing NaNo . Grad school is already like the NaNo of BSing papers . 
* rolls eyes forever * 
ughhhhhh e.e please spare me . 
I can't wait for < PROPFIRST > to get fat . 
single-spaced papers will be the death of me . 
< PROPFIRST > had a safe surgery and will be home tomorrow ^_^ 
< PROPFEMALE > would like you all to know that she is a mountain lion . 
All I want for Christmas is a printer in < PROPFIRST > Library that doesn't jam every 5 minutes . 
In 20 minutes the only people with finals remaining should be SISLT folks . I expect no further reference questions because really , given their < PROPMALE > , they should all be able to do their OWN research . 
Sometimes I wonder if there's a hidden camera somewhere in my parents ' house . No way can all the things they say be real . I would give an example , but I'm pretty sure they would kill me . 
Worst mistake from last night : \Vampires are from Tasmania . \ " THEY COULD BE . YOU DON'T KNOW . " 
:D Working 3:30 -11pm at the library on Super Bowl Sunday . Hoping to get a lot of homework done . Except ... the nerds who would be there anyway probably aren't interested in the Super Bowl to begin with . Hrm . 
OK . TONIGHT . ASSASSINATING FRENCH DUDES . PUNCHING SOME BEGGAR WOMEN IN THE FACE . ACCIDENTALLY KILLING CIVILIANS WITH THROWING KNIVES . IT IS ON , ASSASSIN'S CREED ! 
I'm appropriately spending my < PROPFIRST>'s Day at the library with the love of my life : books . 
Spent my night coloring and watching < PROPFEMALE > and the Great Mouse Detective . Best night . 
\People you may know : < PROPMALE > Urie . +1 Add as friend\ " Ummmmmmm no facebook I don't think I'm on friending terms with < PROPMALE > freakin ' Urie . But thanks for the thought . " 
^_^ 
I'm glad there's nobody in the workroom to catch me singing Ponyo to myself . 
omg everyone I'm filling out my cover spec sheet ! WHAT DO I WANT MY BOOK COVER TO LOOK LIKE ? 
singing \oh reference desk\ " to the tune of \ " o tannenbaum\ " to the cats . craziest cat lady in SISLT ? I think so . "
