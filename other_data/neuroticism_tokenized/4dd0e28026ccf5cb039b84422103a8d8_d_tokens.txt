A bullet hole would look stunning in Misa's head . 
Fangirls : They can smell your fear . 
denial isn't just a long river ... 
The child without a name grew up to be the hand / To watch you , to shield you or kill on demand / The choice he'd made , he could not comprehend / His blood a grim secret , they had to command / He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life / He prayed for both but was denied / So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed / Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind ? 
If at first you don't succeed , call it version 1.0 
Cake = lie ?
