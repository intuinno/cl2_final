well we missed the mail box but def . hit the ditch and lost the cd player :) lmao 
Lorsque j'ai al < PROPFEMALE > r , cette personne dans < PROPFEMALE > miroir n'est pas qui je veux \ 
être . J'ai perdu moi-même et j'ai aucune idée comment revenir d'ici , Ive\ 
brûlé tel < PROPFEMALE > ment de ponts , j'ai peur , je ne seront jamais pardonné . \ 
Comment pourrait-on mal tourner dans une vie massives explosion ? 
Live life with passion , embrace change , follow your dreams , create yourself , believe in the impossible . 
Son of a gun .... I know better than this- I'm just glutton for punishment- why even bother ..? It most certainly isn't what I want but anything is something . 
~ In the end , what breaks you down , makes you better . ~ 
everything is a power struggle- and im going to win . so peace out- i hope you choke on my dust ! 
is irritated ..... simply put- 
nothing better than good tv shows , good friends and peppermint hot chocolate ! :) 
:) :) :) I am super excited !!!!!!! I just got the best news ever !!!! My life is pretty close to perfect- only one thing is missing ! 
ah , i miss the good oe days :( but they will never be again- the skanks ran the good ole crew out :( :( < PROPFIRST > days :( 
Do not be pushed by your problems . \ 
Be led by your dreams . \ 
\ 
~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
im wondering if i can ever fix this mistake ....? can i come back from this one ...? i miss my heart and ive never been more sorry then i am now for skipping out like i did .. :( all i can do is be there and hope one day the table will turn in my direction .

Sometimes music is the only medicine the heart and soul need :) 
holy god- that was an eventful morning . 
truth hurts , but sometimes you need it thrown in your face- to really open your eyes up to see 
i love my flowers and i love you ! miss u already ! 
i think sleep on sat nights is going to be a real distant memory ... :( no more sleep for me on the weekends . 
break time !! time for a cat nap then back to being a good little worker < PROPFEMALE > 
:/ my heart is breaking :( 
anyone care to join me for a dance in the rain ? 
Carpe Viam 
its snowing ! 
this is madness ! 
One day , I will get my happy ending . 
i swear the next person who wants a damn scratch off im gunna shove it up their ass 
:( 
i feel like i want to wash my hands of all of this .. 
is it just me who takes offense when someone comes into ur place of work and gives u a card about \finding jesus\ " in ur life ? " 
Public apology . I'm really sorry for making plans with ya'll then breaking them , or just not talking to you nearly as much as I have in the past . I'm sorry that I have been unsocial and unkind . I have just been really busy with work and not feeling like I have had a spare minute to just relax comfortably , I will get better and stop treating ya'll like crap . I promise . 
Having a small bonfire later of a few personal belongings- perhaps a shirt and some marriage papers ... anyone down for a beer or two while I watch my stress burn up ...? lol 
my fire burned quite nicely until the fire department came twice and the cops once , the fire dept was awesome and way understanding . i liked em 
okay frostwire bites asshole- they dont have any of my songs- any other suggestions on what to use ? 
:) better 
yea ... I'm a music pusher lol- so what ! to each their own <3 
.......... Where to next ? Idea's .....? 
:/ assholes 
In <3 with urban dictionary . :) my last comment on my previous post got my brain stewing , so I googled brown eye- and the link for urban dictionary came up- so curious- I opened it , --- simply put ---- funny shit . 
I wonder if the urge to run will dissipate as I get older . My span @ a certain place usually lasts a few months and I’m ready for somewhere new . I’m already ready to go . But I know I need to stay . L this is by far one of the hardest things for me to accomplish . When every morning I wake up , I just want to pack up and leave . What am I looking for ... 
Just an FYI to everyone , I don't have my cell anymore- Don't try to text or call . If you need to get a hold of me just shoot me a mes . on here . 
I get off work @ 5- anything to do in this stupid town ? 
I'm off work- have an evening free for once , and I'm just twidling my thumbs . :( boo 
< PROPFEMALE > .. umm ... I just woke up on the hardwood floor in front of roomies bedroom door halfway in the bathroom- halfway out . Still dressed in what I was wearing to work yesterday with no coat or sweater on- freezing . Ouch < PROPMALE > - I feel ur pain from the other night . lol . I'm such a light weight it's pathetic lol 
:) nap time <3 
So , I got new long johns today- < PROPMALE > style- yea , lol- was so excited to use them- but its too warm out :( 
Through the struggle I will become who I'm destined to be . 
See what happens when I'm stuck @ home all day with internet- I find ways to escape ! < PROPFEMALE > many work abroad programs .. :) :) Which one do I choose ??!!!! 
I HATE being sick :( :( 
Do I jump into school next summer with a massive student < PROPFEMALE > or do I take a year away from everyone and technology- to \really\ " find myself ? " 
So .. my grilled pb&J was a three part process/ stove to broiler to microwave . I'm certain I went wrong somewhere just not sure as to where lol 
I’m quite the contradiction I took some Benadryl around 830 hoping it will put me out since I have slept so much over the past couple of days- I wanted to be well rested for work tomorrow . Then Around 10 coffee sounds amazing ! So I brew some Silly me I swear I can never make a decision until it’s too late to turn back . :( Maybe one day I will learn ...... 
Discovered a new love ... blueberry hot tea <3 <3 <3 
One day , I will wake up and be free of you and the horrible feeling the swallows me whole when I think of you .... And hopefully that day will come sooner rather than later ... 
Wine Tasting tonight- come out ! 
Great night @ work , A beautiful walk home , Some steamed veggies and an indie movie = AMAZING NIGHT ! <3 <3 <3 <3 
I know I work @ 6 am- and have to be up @ 4 , but I got new creamer ! <3 it's a bad idea because I'm borderline lactose intolerant , so anything milk related upsets my stomach- but coffee&creamer has always been a guilty pleasure of mine :) So I'm glutton for punishment- but hey its right before i go to bed so @ least I dont have to be productive lmao 
Work :( 
Well off to work ... Everyone have a Great day !! 
“The web of life is of a mingled yarn , good and ill together . ” – < PROPFIRST > Shakespeare 
Damn the procrastination that plagues me 
Hey --- don't forget to call next door ---- Since its your job to be the informant . 
I talked to my mom finally <3 miss her .... 
GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 
I miss my family :( :( :( I wish I was there right now .... I love you guys and I hope you are having a wonderful Holiday . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas Everyone ! 
Got the best Christmas gift ever !!!!! < PROPFEMALE > <3 and a few other great things !!! Plus news . great day <3 <3 <3 
This week can just fly right on by and I would be exstatic ! 
Sleeping in short sleeves , on a leather couch with a light blanket- right by a drafty window doesn't do much for ones health . :( 
Well now , I guess that just took care of itself . Hmm . Oh well . life . 
obviously building up an immunity to benadryl ... :( Crap . Now how the hell do I expect to get any sleep ..... :( :( :( I suppose I could go on a walk here in a little bit ... Drinking a glass of wine , hoping that does the trick . -- Any suggestions on how to put an insomniac to bed @ night ? 
Let go of your inhibitions and dive in head first , you only get one life , one < PROPMALE > to make any given time in your life an incredible memory ! Release your fears- and let yourself live ! 
Best afternoon in a long time <3 <3 <3 my family . 
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 my life 
Old people still suffering from empty nest syndrome suck @ life . Glad I've learned \some\ " ( not saying alot- lol ) self control or she'd be sleeping with the fishies @ the bottom of our nasty lake . " 
dead to the world , feel like Ive been hit by a < PROPMALE > truck . :( 
In over my head 
Your creation- is your life- your happiness- your peace , it's your life's masterpiece . My canvas- needs to hit the scrap pile- and quick . Time to move on . 
GGRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr really ! 
Secrets- life is one big game of secrecy- who is going to win >>> ? & Is there happiness in winning ? 
FML :( Well , I know what I'm doing after work- maybe I should have a drink before I have to go put up with all the lovely waiting that I'm unfortunately going to be stuck with :( :( :( GOOOoooody 
Cut the ties- and embrace the freedom ! Lol- This is going to be an awkward situation , but worth it- I love the fact that I am paying for an apartment- and I get to be the one to sleep on the couch . Fun fun fun 
Going to puke :/ 
I know it sounds weird because this is what I \wanted\ " .... but I don't want to go home to an empty apartment tonight ... " 
internet @ home tomorrow night !! Finally yey- count me a happy camper <3 
What to do tomorrow night >> ? I'm off , Any idea's ...? 
Aaaannnnd , the worst has hit ..... Big blow ..... I'm so fucked its not even funny .... 
hmmm ... veggies 
Had so much fun tonight it was ridiculous . I'm so glad I went out- I love you < PROPFEMALE > - you are an absolute blast to party with- :) So glad I got the < PROPMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > out with you tonight !!!! 
It's not even remotely creepy that I have to do my laundry is a dark , dank basement of a house that used to be a funeral home . \ 
The basement is closed off in sections- while I get the privilege of doing my laundry down there , I may sit and ponder behind which door did they perform the embalming >> ? Oh goody . 
Wow .. really . Can someone take a plunger to my life please >>> ? 
I'm ready for another tattoo :) 
Freedom lies in being bold . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Frost \ 
So , lets be free . 
Should I take out my lip ring ... >>> thoughts ...? 
Going to go smoke my very last cigarette :( \ 
might be wise to stay away from me for a couple of days ... not going to be the happiest camper . 
No hot water ... :( Super excited for a cold shower 
thinking of picking up and dipping- fuck this town- fuck this apt- fuck it all 
needs coffee :( 
Have to drag a mattress and box spring upstairs to my apt at some point in time over the next day --- i cant do it alone- anyone down to help > ? 
Can you please direct me to the closest store selling motivation > ? It seems I've run out . 
at almost 25 .... one would think I would have learned to love already .... or at least let love in ... and yet- I prove that wrong ... when will I stop pushing > ? 
Pardonnez-moi , car je ne sais pas ce que je fais .. 
GOSH DARN IT ... :( I was looking forward to going home , soaking the in the bath and taking a pain pill for my back ... only to realize ...... I can't take a bath ..... Ghetto apartment :/ bath tub did not come equipped with a faucet . 
work :( here I come ... 
not much of a nester anymore .... 
Bye , bye bills . No more netflix , no more gym , its all going down the toilet till spring . 
I think I am going to cut all my hair off , a little shorter than my shoulders :) 
I want to go home .... 
One day .... in the distant-distant future- I will see you again ... 
:( :( :( 
Life is a wicked bitch of a ride 
bedtime :) 
I'm so over being sick ... :( 
Hey Everyone- Come see us down here at < PROPFIRST>'s!!! We have great specials tonight !!! :) :) Come keep me company ! Passing out free tank tops for all the ladies that come in tonight !! 
i miss my long hair :( 
I have come to the conclusion that < PROPFIRST > sippers and starbucks need to add delivery drivers to their pay roll- id be calling them ALL the time . 
Okay , I'm so over living alone- anyone know of someone looking for a roomate > ? 
How easy it is for us to forget who we are - if you are not you and u do not embrace your unique individuality then you are simply a waste and are depriving the world of someone different . We are all weird and different in our own ways that is the beauty in life . The differences between everything . 
Come out and see us at < PROPFIRST>'s tonight !!! We have great specials . 
Wish it was raining and I was off work to play in it <3 
Age old debate ---- do I do what will make me happy , because life is too short- or do i suck it up because im an adult and bills have to get paid ...? Can I please go back to being a kid ? Does anyone have a time machine >>> ? 
Exhausted of trying to fall asleep at a decent hour , sadly 2 or 3 am still falls into a \decent\ " hour for me .... I've tried everything ... warm shower- hot cup of tea- a full belly- running on no sleep- a fan- ( meds bring weird dreams 
Phones back ! <3 
Dreams .... are short lived -- plan b . time 
We should all take a moment to feast on the fact that our lives are good ... may not be exactly what we want , may be far from what we want- but its better then others have it- and in life- there are so many open doors- so many options- so if you dont like it- you are free to change your situation . 
The bbq was amazing ! My belly thanks you :) 
Come out to < PROPFIRST>'s tonight -- GREAT drink specials -- No loud band noise -- Come celebrate < PROPFEMALE>'s stellar b-day shindig -come show love- and one of the best reasons to drink -- MARDI GRAS -- well be passing out beads and masks !

What has this world come to that we treat fellow human beings the way we are being treated .... :( It's not right ... 
The homestead is calling my name more and more everyday .

Ahh .... kc . How I have NOT missed you . :/ 
I know < PROPFIRST>'s certainly teeters on the line of decency in alot of people's eyes . But no other place of employment will ever make me feel at home like that place did . I will forever miss the wonderful girls i got the privilege to work with and the amazing dj , as well as the customers that always kept a smile on my face . One of the best places to work ever ( for the people ) . 
Lazy day filled with books and coffee :) 
I forgot why I despised this house , now I remember . Can't find a singular space outdoors that isn't infested with wasps .... So much for taking the reading outside ... :( I will be FOREVER white this summer :( 
These clove cigarettes hardly compare :( ready to go out for a drink with an old friend :) 
I wanna snuggle :( anyone want to make a trip to kc ? Lol 
Yup reclaimed my youth tonight lol built a righteous sand castle now playing at the park :) 
\Normal\ " is highly overrated " 
< PROPFEMALE > urges me on , as fear bridles me 
Radio blared , wood floor , pledge sprayed on the bottom of your slippers = VERY amusing entertainment . :) 
:) Bar , wii dance , cinnamon challenge throw down , laughs with friends \ 
<3 ' d my night tonight 
One of my deepest fears is opening my heart to someone else and have it be broken again , that's how I rationalize being the way I am . But I've come to realize that NO ONE has left me in the last five years because I beat them to the punch ... Never any visible clues that I was going to be left- but I leave anyway ... I've lost out on a lot of greatness :( 
Should never have left IL , this move was not the right choice . Crap . 
This is when I need a punching bag @ home- beats hitting the wall . 
Ooohhh pooo ... :/ spilled an orange Popsicle on my white sheets . no dice ... 
Alas , freedom shall be mine ! Finally uncovered what I needed to let go . :) I am one step more in the light , of the darkness in confusion . Perhaps that is why nothing ever worked out in that department- I was playing in the wrong field . ;) 
I <<<33333 Popsicles lol 
I feel like I am 50 , seriously > ? Who gets heartburn from EVERYTHING --- oh oh oh wait ---- I do , I do . YUCK ! 
Getting ready to take my aggression out on the bar outside- hammers --- check . shovels ---- check . any other tools i might find amusing to use ---- check . Mean face --- check , check . lol . Would be much more fun if I had a chainsaw . :) But .. I'd like to keep all my limbs , so were going to nix that tool . 
Going on a walk . Maybe if I'm lucky the wind will just take me away . 
Morning workout- tuna for lunch , studying- then evening workout- goody 
Soco and Pepsi , yum . Nothing like drinking alone- :) oh happy night . 
If only ... 
UUGGH , righteous stomach pains today ... wtf :( 
Still going from last night , no more diet pills after 5pm lol
