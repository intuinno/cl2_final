Vacation ! But so complicated a vacation I'd almost rather stay home . . . hubby and two kids are home , eldest daughter driving from VA to SC so that she can pick me and brother < PROPFIRST > up at the airport after I drive to TN then fly from there to SC . . . is it worth it ? I hope so . . . .

What's yours going to be today ? Keep your eyes and ears open ! 
Be kinder than necessary this day ;\ 
for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle . 
Had a pretty Happy Birthday , I did ! Got lots of good wishes on FB , closed on our house ( what a present ! ) , got an ipod and a Nook . Do those make me hip & up to date , or kinda behind the times to just now be getting those kind of things ? Dunno . Also had a great homemade daughter-made yellow cake with fresh , organic cherries & pineapple . Love , love , love that fresh fruit - the nuts I already have in the family !

So . . . interesting weekend . Checked on Triona's summer-abandoned apartment in < PROPFEMALE > , got her yet another bookshelf , and bought her a bird . A baby Cockatiel , to be exact . The breeder/trainers will keep it another month and she'll pick it up a week before classes start back next month . 
Just went \walking in Memphis\ " for twenty blocks in the summer morning heat . . . what can I do to beat that for the rest of the day ? " 
Been scanning old pictures . . . so I'm posting tomboy me , circa ' 68 .

Okay , aged my profile pic to just a little closer to now - - went from elementary school to < PROPMALE > high . . . guess that means next week I gotta find high school , and then after Labor Day a college pic . . . eventually it'll be back to good old me !

My heart has been to heck and back ; it has made me stronger . Despite the pain , it has never given up , not even when in the ICU deciding whether to die or not . So here's to everyone in my heart , including those of you who don't think you're there . If you can read this , I love you .

Now - - the life review in photos is up to 1982 : Our first engagement photo for the newspapers , taken in the latter part of our first year in medical school together . 
A person's true nature is revealed by how they treat those they have no reason to be nice to . 
Okay , life review in profile pics continues on in 1982 - - my wedding day ! 
The feeling of being loved by your special someone is the most precious gift that life can ever give you . 
A little side-track off the chronological pictorial review . . . today begins my tenth year without my Dad . Miss you bunches and muchly , < PROPMALE > Turney ! 
My children and my husband are the very reason I get up each morning , the reason that I breathe , and the reason that I pray that God gives me another day ! 
Okay , down with the Dad picture ( which actually startled even me a couple of times this week ) and back to happier things in the life review in pics . After the wedding in 1982 , before we knew it we were out of med school and in residency - - but guess what also came along right about then !?! We named her Triona . . . wowsers . 
Everybody turn and kiss your kids , hug your spouse , appreciate what you have . My second cousin lost her 34-yr old husband yesterday completely unexpectedly and has to support their 8 and 10 year old children through it . God only knows when something like this happens and why . I pray the whole family has the strength which only He can supply , as well . 
We each have a path to walk on earth . We can walk it alone in fear and anger or we can look up smile hold onto our Fathers strong hand and skip along the path . 
So , Triona , here's one without ruffles . Apparently it was as exhausting being the baby of two resident doctors as much as it was to be a new parent and a resident . 
Heading to < PROPFEMALE > ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Erina used to sleep so much she'd ALMOST worry me . . . but after her more . . . adventuresome , shall we say ?. . . sister , I didn't complain too much . When she was awake she was a joy . Still is . Here she's enjoying her first Christmas , 1991 . 
From\ 
< PROPFEMALE > Williamson's book \Everyday Grace\ " \ " There is no problem to \ 
Weekly life review picture . So , it was the early 90's , and we had two girls . At least they got along and didn't mind our occasional retro tastes , like these tie-dye shirts . . . 
Whew ! Seven hours to fill out a job application ! If I don't get this job , I'm gonna cry . . . not because it's that great a job , but just because I spent that much time filling out all that stuff for nothing . . . 
This profile picture is of my girlie girl ( Erina ) at 2 years old , in 1993 . Something funny about this dress - - I wore one that looked exactly like that when in the play \The Wizard of Oz\ " in high school ! " 
I know that high school jackets with letters on them aren't nearly the status symbol they were a few decades ago , but , but . . . MY SON GOT AN ACADEMIC LETTER TONIGHT !!! I'm so proud I could just pop !!! The letters ( of course , we have to pay for a jacket to put it on ) were given out to the top 20% of the school , GPAs of 3.4 or greater . I'm still so very , very proud !! 
So , while raising my sleepy , girlie girl second child , this is about as girlie as my eldest would get - - a clean pair of sweat pants with her < PROPFEMALE > Mouse sweatshirt . Triona would pull her hair back while doing gymnastics , but definitely no bows or barrettes ! - - here at about 6 yrs old , 1993 . 
Happy Thanksgiving to all ! I'm thankful that my children , my hubby , and my brother don't require a fanciful feast to enjoy the now , but we're gonna try one anyway ! 
Continuing life review . . . in 1994 , < PROPFIRST > and I took our first REAL vacation since our honeymoon . . . IRELAND !! This is the cliffs of Moher . I found my real home , and constantly long to go back . 
Away with the cartoon , back to life review . . . < PROPFIRST > and I were getting on the plane to come home from Ireland and I told him I thought we'd made the best souvenir ever . He didn't believe me for a while , but the girls did . We got a baby brother for them out of that trip ! < PROPMALE > was born exactly nine months after the first Ireland trip . 
Family picture circa late 1995 . . . the girls called this < PROPMALE>'s \Jacob Marley\ " picture because of the little tweed vest . I loved it . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all ! I hope this isn't my last with my brother < PROPFIRST > , but if it is , he's going out in style at least . Happy times . 
I love my extended family , but . . . after a week of having to ponder where I am every time I open my eyes . . . it's FANTASTIC to be home !!! 
Gimme a week or two to scan any more life review pics - - meanwhile , here's one to go in the local paper that's interviewing me about being the new Health Dept director .

Politics ! Why does there always have to be politics ? Even the word is icky . . . Poly means many , and ticks are blood-sucking parasites ! 
Tomorrow ( April 18 ) is National Stress Awareness Day ! It's usually on April 16 , because that's the day after Tax Day , but since April 15 was a Friday , and it's okay to wait until Monday to file taxes , and then ' we ' didn't want to put off the Stress Awareness just one more day , then Final Tax Filing Day and Stress Awareness Day are the same day this year ! Does that make sense ? Or does it stress you ? 
Monday , April 25 , celebrate National Red Hat Society Day ! Wear one if you've got it ! 
What do you do for Administrative Professionals Day when you have at least 40 clerks and secretaries working for you ? Pretend you forgot ? Give them each a hug ? I'd like to do something , but I'm neither < PROPMALE > nor omnipresent ...

Only one fatality from the storms in my Health Districts here in VA , but in Washington County , VA , a truck stop was hit and 18 wheelers were scattered like Lego blocks .

So , anyone that's seen the news knows that we here in South Central VA government have really had a day and a half today ! All emergency systems were activated , and thankfully almost all of us have been told to stand down . So , the news is good . No fatalities . Only a few structures damaged and minor injuries . Only one emergency shelter necessary in the whole state . I'm on standby in case they need more help , but home now and the family is all fine as well . Thanks for any & all prayers . 
Looting ?!? Really , people , there was just a Hurricane ! You should be trying to help your fellow man , not steal their stuff ! I'm praying for you , anyway . 
Perhaps one the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation . Let's all appreciate being safe , dry , and in good shelter .
