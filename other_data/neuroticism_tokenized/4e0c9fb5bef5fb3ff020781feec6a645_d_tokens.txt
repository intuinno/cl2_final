If you have a wonderful man who works hard , loves you and would do anything for you , who makes you laugh , who's your best friend , who wants to grow old with you , who will always pick you up when you're down , who is your world and someone that you're thankful for , then post this on your status and give the good men the recognition they deserve because great men are few and far between and I have one !
