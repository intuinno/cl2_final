Last full week of school til Senior Trip ! 
Finally home from Senior Trip . Most fun I've had in a long time . 
Friends , pizza , and MW2 ... Yeah , Tuesday's gonna be epic . 
Now I just have to figure out what to do for the rest of the summer ... 
Why does the general public seem to love the things I detest ? ( Twilight , < PROPFIRST > Bieber , Disney , etc . ) 
If ' pro ' is the opposite of ' con ' what is the opposite of ' progress' ? 
Registration Day at CSU tomorrow , then off to NC ! 
Spending the week with family in NC . Hopefully I'll bring back some pictures . 
Had a great time in NC , but I'm glad to be back home .
