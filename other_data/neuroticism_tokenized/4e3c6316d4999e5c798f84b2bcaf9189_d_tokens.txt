YOU'RE ALL HOMOS . IF YOU'RE READING THIS , YOU'RE A HOMO . SUPRISE SUPRISE FAGGOTS 

Okay so ... I don't get onto Facebook for about a year or two ... then I get on and EVERYONE I'VE EVER MET SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL has friended me . Seriously , I have no clue how you guys even remembered my stupid name . 
So ... Who's going to be in VA on Aug . 9th to help me celebrate my 21st ?! =D Come ooooon , you all know you've always wanted to get drunk with me ! 
I'm leaving for VA tomorrow night if I can manage to fucking PACK AND CLEAN tonight/tomorrow morning . I'm excited to see my friends again and all , but GODDAMN . I couldn't get just one more day . :/ 
Offering $5 sketch commissions in an attempt to raise money to save my kitties . It's not going very well . : C 
Someone talk me out of just up and leaving without a destination in mind . I already have my suitcases out and I'm ready to pack again . 
I have the best friends in the world : I The end . I only hope that one day I can return all of the kindness I have been shown . 
just got a suit . It is so snazzy . Now I just need a hot date so that I have an excuse to wear it :/ 
It's time for Nekocon faggotry . Look for the guy with the briefcase . 
Hungry . Staring at a wall to alleviate it . :/ I hate being poor .
