I normally don't like these but ... THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING . Let's see how honest FB friends are . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me . It can only be 1 word . No more than 1 word . Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This should be interesting ... I wonder if I have 20 brave friends who will do this ? 

what if c-a-t spells dog ? 
Who the hell is < PROPFEMALE > Murphy ? 
It's like gambling somehow . You go out for a night of drinking and you don't know where your going to end up the next day . It could work out good or it could be disastrous . It's like the throw of the dice 
If human beings were shown what they're really like , they'd either kill one another as vermin , or < PROPFEMALE > themselves . 
A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love . 
Man SCREW UK !!! 
In the evening When the day is done I'm looking for a woman But the girl don't come So don't you let her Play you for a fool She don't show no pity She don't make no rules So don't you let her Get under your skin From the day that you begin I hear you crying in the darkness Don't ask nobody's help Ain't no pockets full of mercy Cause you can only blame yourself 
All gods are homemade , and it is we who pull their strings , and so , give them the power to pull ours . 
Once I had a little game , I liked to crawl back into my brain , I think you know the game i mean , I mean the game called go insane ? Now you should try this little game , Just close your eyes and forget your name , Forget the world and forget the people . This little game is fun to do , Just close your eyes no way to lose , And I'm right there , I'm going too , Release control we're breaking through . 
Is everybody in ? Is everybody in ? The ceremony is about to begin . 
No one but me can save myself but it's too late , Now i can't think why i should even try , Yesterday seems as though it never existed , Death greets warm , Now I will just say goodbye . 
If one were to take the bible seriously one would go mad . But to take the bible seriously , one must be already mad . 
I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him , in the ordinary sense of the word . I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff 
“How fortunate for governments that the people they administer don't think” I wonder how many of you know what I'm talking about ? 
People fear death even more than pain . It's strange that they fear death . Life hurts a lot more than death . At the point of death , the pain is over . Yeah , I guess it is a friend 
“Is man one of God's blunders ? Or is God one of man's blunders ? ” 
We are the all singing all dancing crap of the world 
It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane . 
Does anyone remember laughter ? 
Why is everyone hating on the rain ? I think it's awesome . 
Love me or hate me , but spare me your indifference . 
\Love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as they are not . \ " That quote about sums up about how i feel right now . I should of known better than to delude myself . " 
Did anyone see on the news where four kids got sent home from school for wearing american flag t-shirts on cinco de mayo in california ? That is fucking ridiculous ! So what if they dont like seeing somebody wearing the American flag dont come to our country . So , I guess basically the American flag has turned into the rebel flag now , it's seen as racist to wear it and racist to be patriotic . 
Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy b-day , too bad i had to work though . I'll be out saturday night gettin drunk celebrating a belated b-day so look for me at the bars . 
Don't you hate when you work third shift and you get calls in the middle of the day while you're trying to sleep ? Not only that one of the calls was from the auto shop saying that the damage done to my car from just going over some railroad tracks too fast is gonna cost me 4200 DOLLARS !!! And i'm not even sure insurance is gonna cover it . 
I should insinuate that i didnt just get ONE call but about 4 or 5 in the span of about 30 to 40 minutes , the auto shop , my dad , and some friends

Bright light almost blinding , \ 
Black night still there shining . \ 
I can't stop keep on climbing , \ 
Looking for what I knew . \ 
\ 
Had a friend she once told me , \ 
\You got a love 
I want those feeble minded axes overthrown\ 
I'm not into your passport picture , I just like your nose\ 
You welcome me with open arms and open legs\ 
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs . 
I call you on the telephone my voice too rough with cigarettes\ 
I sometimes think I should just go home\ 
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets\ 
I love to hear you say my name especially when you say yes\ 
I got your body right now on my mind\ 
... And I've drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex\ 
To the sound of old T-Rex- who's next ? 
When the music is your special friend \ 
Dance on fire as it intends\ 
Music is your only friend\ 
Until the end\ 
Cancel my subscription to the resurrection\ 
Send my credentials to the house of detention\ 
I got some friends inside\ 
The face in the mirror won't stop\ 
The girl in the window won't drop\ 
A feast of friends , alive , she cried , waitin for me outside 
Many times I loved , Many times been bitten\ 
Many times I've gazed , Along the open road\ 
Many times I've lied , Many times I've listened\ 
Many times I've wondered , How Much there is to know\ 
Many dreams come true , And some have silver linings\ 
I live for my dream , And a pocketful of gold\ 
Some Acapulco Gold

I had a dream\ 
A crazy dream\ 
Anything i wanted to know\ 
Any place i wanted to go\ 
Hear my song\ 
People won't you listen now , Sing along\ 
You don't know what you're missing now\ 
Any little song that you know \ 
Everything that's small has to grow\ 
California sunlight , sweetlight Calcutta rain\ 
Honolulu starbright , the song remains the same 
Knew this girl once who told me that she liked me a lot . At one point , she told me that when we first started talking she was still with her ex . Then she says she's had a change of heart , whatever the hell that means , and says we should just be friends . Not a week later she's already dating another guy . That sorta tells me that she was talking and/or seeing this guy the same time as she was seeing me . You agree ?

Right now there is a Correctional Officer at work in a world full of psychos , sickos , and sociopaths . They are often outnumbered by more than 60-1 . Often they are assaulted , humiliated and exposed to disease . They endure all this to keep the bad guys behind bars and off our streets . It's law enforcement apperication ... week .

There's nothing special about it\ 
It's either there when you're born or not\ 
Gifted with talent is no big deal\ 
Welcome to the death of the century\ 
Because yesterday don't mean shit\ 
What's over is over and nothing in between\ 
Yesterday don't mean shit\ 
Because tomorrow is the day you will have to face\ 
There's no rewinding time . 
Riders on the storm , Riders on the storm\ 
Into this house we're born\ 
Into this world we're thrown\ 
Like a dog without a bone\ 
An actor out on loan\ 
Riders on the storm\ 
There's a killer on the road\ 
His brain is squirming like a toad\ 
Take a long holiday\ 
Let your children play\ 
If ya give this man a ride\ 
Sweet memory will die\ 
Killer on the road 
So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls ? \ 
Just the beer light to guide us , \ 
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands ? \ 
Ziggy played for time , jiving us that we were Voodoo\ 
The kids was just crass , he was the nazz\ 
With God given ass\ 
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar . \ 
Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind 
Ziggy played guitar , jamming good with Wierd and Gilly , \ 
The Spiders from Mars . \ 
He played it left hand , but made it too far , \ 
He became the special man , then we were Ziggy's Band . \ 
Ziggy really sang , screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo\ 
Like some cat from Japan , he could lick ' em by smiling\ 
He could leave ' em to hang\

Don't you ever wonder why nothing ever seems to change \ 
If it does it's for the worse seems it's just a modern curse \ 
Sometimes when I take a peek outside of my little cage \ 
Everyone looks so asleep will they die before they wake \ 
And hey , don't you know ? We're just products of our time \ 
And hey , what d'ya say ? Show me yours , I'll show you mine 
I like you though you may not like me back \ 
I would dazzle you with brilliance , if I only had the knack \ 
' Cause I like you just the way you are\ 
I like my stupid life just the way it is \ 
And the castles all around me , have been melting now for years \ 
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here \ 
All the efforts , sweat , and broken hearts , the screaming and the tears 
The cracks between the paving stones , Look like rivers of flowing veins . \ 
Strange people who know me , Peeping from behind every window pane . \ 
The girl I used to love , Lives in this yellow house . \ 
Yesterday she passed me by , She doesn't want to know me now . \ 
Can you see the real me , can you ? 
“We're born alone , we live alone , we die alone . Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone . ” 
As I was goin over the Cork and < PROPFIRST > Mountains\ 
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin\ 
I first produced my pistol , then produced my rapier\ 
I said stand or deliver or the devil he may take ya\ 
Being drunk and weary I went to < PROPFEMALE>'s chamber\ 
Takin my money with me and I never knew the danger\ 
About six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell\ 
I jumped up fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels 
The day has come for all us sinners\ 
If you're not a servant , you'll be struck to the ground\ 
Flee the burning , greedy city\ 
Loo < PROPMALE > back on her to there's nothing around\ 
I don't believe in < PROPFEMALE > tales and no one wants to go to hell\ 
We've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see\ 
Now if you wanna serve above or be a < PROPMALE > below with us\ 
You're welcome to the city where the future is set forever 
is it true that what we do in life echoes in eternity ? 
Pain is weakness leaving the body , so quit crying your tears of \woe is me\ " and rejoice ! " 
I like my stupid life , just the way it is \ 
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs\ 
\You can't fight the tears that ain't coming\ 
Don't you think I know what I'm doing\ 
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong\ 
You're the one who's really a loser\ 
This is where I feel I belong\ 
< PROPFEMALE > world with winter flowers\ 
Turns my day to frozen hours\ 
Lying snowblind in the sun\ 
Will my ice age ever come ? 
Strange eyes fill strange rooms\ 
Voices will signal their tired end\ 
The hostess is grinning\ 
Her guests sleep from sinning\ 
Hear me talk of sin\ 
And you know this is it\ 
Strange days have found us\ 
And through their strange hours\ 
We linger alone\ 
Bodies confused\ 
Memories misused\ 
As we run from the day\ 
To a strange night of stone 
Let's swim to the < PROPFEMALE > , uh huh\ 
Let's climb through the tide\ 
Penetrate the evenin ' that the\ 
City sleeps to hide\ 
Let's swim out tonight , love\ 
It's our turn to try\ 
Parked beside the ocean\ 
On our < PROPFEMALE > light drive\ 
Surrender to the waiting worlds\ 
That lap against our side\ 
Nothin ' left open\ 
And no time to decide\ 
We've stepped into a river\ 
On our < PROPFEMALE > light drive 
Anyone who shares and celebrates their divorce on facebook , and tells the man who she was unfaithful with to comment on her status about it , must have no principles and very low moral values . 
The muffin man is seated at the table\ 
in the laboratory of the utility muffin Research kitchen . \ 
Reaching for an oversized chrome spoon , \ 
he gathers an Intimate quantity of dried muffin\ 
remnants and brushing his scapular aside , \ 
Procceds to dump these inside of his shirt ... \ 
He turns to us and speaks :\ 
Some people like cupcakes better . \ 
I for one care less for them ! 
' Cause I like you just the way you are , I like this life just the way it is \ 
All the efforts , sweat , and broken hearts , the screaming and the tears \ 
Got a little talking to , by the mirror in my room , and I don't really care . . . \ 
Whispering voices from the dead , come from underneath my bed 
Wait another minute . \ 
Can't you see what this pain has fucking done to me ? \ 
I'm alive and still kickin ' . \ 
What you see I can't see ... \ 
and maybe you'll think before you speak . \ 
Take another second . \ 
Turn your back on me ... \ 
and make believe that you're always happy . \ 
It's safe to say you're never alive . \ 
A big part of you has died . \ 
And by the way ... \ 
I hope you're satisfied . 
Go , UCONN !!! 
Whispering voices from the dead , come from underneath my bed \ 
And I don't really care \ 
And the chaos that surrounds me like a flock of screaming pigs \ 
And it hurts my brain to think of all the stupid things I've said \ 
And if I could change the future I would change the past instead 
My eyes are blind but I can see\ 
The snowflakes glisten on the tree\ 
The sun no longer sets me free\ 
I feel there's no place freezing me\ 
Let the winter sun shine on\ 
Let me feel the frost of dawn\ 
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow\ 
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow 
God save Obama , his socialist regime\ 
it made you a moron a potential H bomb ! \ 
God save Obama , he ain't no human being\ 
there is no future in < PROPFEMALE>'s dreaming\ 
Don't be told what you want , don't be told what you need\ 
there's no future , no future , no future for you 
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground\ 
Try this trick and spin it , yeah\ 
Your head will collapse\ 
When there's nothing in it \ 
And you'll ask yourself\ 
Where is my mind ? 
I hope all those people who are or are planning to get married out there pay close attention to this post : \ 
There's a way of transferring funds that is even faster than electronic banking . It's called marriage . \ 
Marriage is give and take . You'd better give it to her or she'll take it anyway . \ 
Marriage is like a cage ; one sees the birds outside desperate to get in , and those inside equally desperate to get out . 
People shouldn't be afraid of their government , the government should be afraid of its people 
I have never seen a wild thing\ 
Feeling sorry for itself\ 
A bird would drop frozen dead off of a bough\ 
Without ever having felt sorry for itself 
Welcome to my nightmare\ 
I think you're gonna like it , \ 
I think you're gonna feel\ 
Like you belong , \ 
A nocturnal vacation , \ 
Unnecessary sedation , \ 
You want to feel at home\ 
Cause you belong , \ 
Welcome to my breakdown 
These words he speaks are true\ 
We're just all humanary stew\ 
If we don't pledge allegiance to\ 
The Black Widow 
Seems like each time\ 
I'm with you I lose my mind , \ 
Because I'm bending over\ 
Backwards to relate\ 
It's one thing to complain\ 
But when you're\ 
Driving me insane\ 
Well then I think it's time\ 
That we took a break\ 
' Cause I'm in too deep\ 
And I'm trying to keep , \ 
Up above in my head\ 
Instead of going under\ 
Instead of going under

A couple came upon a wishing well . The husband\ 
leaned over , made a wish\ 
and threw in a coin . \ 
The wife decided to make a wish , too . But she leaned\ 
over too much , fell\ 
into the well , and drowned . The husband was stunned\ 
for a while but then\ 
smiled “It really works ! “ 
If you have been with someone a long time and keep getting asked by nosey friends \When are you going to marry her ? \ " \ 
If I wanted a loving father , a faithful wife , an honorable neighbor , and a just citizen , I would seek him among the band of Atheists\ 
It is an interesting and demonstrable fact , that all children are atheists and were religion not inculcated into their minds , they would remain so 
If our father was our basis for God , and our father abandoned us , then what does that tell you about God ?

30 Day Challenge : Day 2-Least Favorite Song : I couldn't pick out just one video for this day cause there are a lot of songs I hate . Just pick any rap video on youtube and that will probably be my least favorite song . 
I said come here momma\ 
Come here quick\ 
This old cocaine makes me sick\ 
Here comes the policeman \ 
All dressed in blue\ 
Don't you he's doin things\ 
He's doin them too 
I'm a pitiful site And I ain't all that bright \ 
I'm definitely not chisled from stone \ 
I'm a cheat and a liar No women's < PROPFEMALE > \ 
I'll probably die cold and alone \ 
So kiss me I'm shitfaced \ 
And I'll soak and I'll soil their ground \ 
In the trousers she kissed me\ 
And I only bought her one round 
If I looked all over the world \ 
And there's every type of girl \ 
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by \ 
And leave me dancing with myself \ 
So let's sink another drink \ 
' Cause it'll give me time to think \ 
If I had a < PROPMALE > , I'd ask one to dance \ 
And I'd be dancing with myself 
Driving through lex I was about to either kill one of the thousands of dumbass drivers or hunt down < PROPFIRST > aldean and kick his ass ! 
He sees his children jumping off at the station one by one\ 
His woman and his best friend in bed and having fun\ 
He's crawling down the corridor on his hands and knees\ 
He hears the silence howling catches angels as they fall\ 
And the all-time winner has got him by the balls\ 
He picks up Gideon's Bible open at < PROPFEMALE > one\ 
God He stole the handle and the train it won't stop 
If a tree fell in the < PROPMALE > with no one around , does it make a sound ?
