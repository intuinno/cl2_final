It is a military tradition that true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship .

I love my military friends !! 
If you think that putting up a mosque , 600ft . from ground zero , and having the dedication ceremony on the anniversary of 9/11/11 is immoral inhumanand shows a complete lack of respect for the memories of all that perished there , and that politicians are doing a grave injustice to the fallen heroes , their families and all the people of New York City , THEN PLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS TO YOUR WALL

A politician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension is not reduced , a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expense account , a soldier must justify extra rations . A politician ... vows to defend their country ; a soldier ... actually keeps that promise . REPOST IF YOU SUPPORT OUR TROOPS ! 
A U.S. military member is somewhere in the world tonight missing their family while you are safe at home .
