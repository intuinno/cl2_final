can't wait to have all the stuff moved into the new place in Oak Park today ! 

is glad that apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop 
can't believe we ordered the 250,000 chocolate bag at Red Light and won four free chef's tasting meals , complete with wine pairings ! 
is wondering if both of these teams should be kicked out of the NFL . I think the top 5 NCAA teams could easily beat either of these teams . 
is slightly disappointed to find out that you harvest horsehair from the horses on Farmville rather than , say , glue or dog food . Does that make me a bad person ? 
is not happy that < PROPFIRST > pulled a Blaise . I'll still go to your restaurant < PROPFIRST > ! 
thinks they should add tomacco as a crop on farmville . 
Out of work as of January 15th , anybody with any leads in structural engineering , please let me know . 
thinks you guys have more brains than a zombie Thanksgiving . 
just received an extra 360 kb of storage for his computer in the form of a 5 1/4\ floppy from the guy near me who's retiring . It's going to come in handy for that extra 20 seconds of music that won't fit on my hard drive . " 
I don't mean to swear , but I am really irritated right now ! 
has the same feelings about Up in the Air as < PROPMALE > did about the three little pigs animatronics at Storytime Village . \That was good ... but not great . \"" 
Sex can screw things up . Why do you think the Three Stooges went through so many Curly's ? 
Bad Office ! You know better than to do a clip show . 
just found out that < PROPMALE > Manilow wrote both the Band-Aid song and the State Farm song . < PROPMALE > Manilow . For real . I couldn't believe it either . 
Why am I always asleep during the earthquakes ? I never feel them ! 
is watching the USA play Switzerland in hockey and thinks the announcers should say that the Swiss team is full of holes . 
has finally given in to Twitter . If you would like to follow me , I'm at jmcwilks . 
loves Chicagoans . < PROPMALE > Skilling posts that it was 42 for a high at the lake today , and people are commenting that it was nice to drive with the windows down ! And before you say it , yes , I am one of the dorks who is a fan of < PROPMALE > Skilling on Facebook . 
Hooray for football ! 
Can someone please explain to me what is so awful about this health care < PROPMALE > ? I understand ( and support ) not giving taxpayer money to fund abortions because it's a very complicated issue , and I can understand ( but do not agree with ) the financially irresponsible argument , but how is it immoral/unconstitutional/going to destroy < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Also , watching the Mythbusters shoot a salami rocket , which , surprisingly enough , is not a euphemism . 
Methinks < PROPFIRST > Zambrano is no longer the Cubs ace : 1.1 IP , 6 H , 2 BB , 8 ER , 2 HR ( including a MONSTER shot to < PROPFIRST > Heyward ) , 1 K , 54.00 < PROPFEMALE > , 6.00 WHIP . 
That was a bizarre end to that game ... 
< PROPMALE > Ricketts just said Wrigley has no bad seats . Has he been to Wrigley ? Don't get me wrong , they're mostly really good to great , but I've bought tickets where I couldn't see the left fielder ! 
Good luck to my sister < PROPFEMALE > running the Boston Marathon ! She starts in about a half an hour ! 
Goodness gracious , < PROPFIRST > Benoit ran an 18:14 in the 5k associated with the Boston Marathon yesterday . She's 51 ! I'm not sure I can run a 5k that fast right now ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s first 5k in 24:53 , she's running much smarter than I did ! 
Goodness gracious ! The winner of the Boston Marathon just ran a 2:05:52 , old course record was 2:07:14 ! That's 26.2 < PROPMALE > worth of 4:48 < PROPMALE > ! I hate those guys ... 
Plan your race , race your plan . Good job so far < PROPFEMALE > , less than 10 < PROPMALE > to go ! #16428 if you're interested ... 
3:29:03 ! Congratulations < PROPFEMALE > ! Well done ! 
Gainfully employed once again ! 
Love ESPN making a story where there isn't one . Just said the Lakers win in the playoffs when Gasol plays well . First of all , duh . When players have better stats , they help their team more , regardless of who it is . Second , Gasol scored 18.0 points in wins vs . 17.4 points in losses and had 10.6 rebounds in wins vs . 9.3 in losses . Let me tell you , those extra 0.6 points and 1.3 rebounds are statistically significant ! 
< PROPMALE > Lincecum is unbelievably good . 
Tickets to Swell Season and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > at Ravinia purchased ! 
DMK Burger Bar + Broken Bells + < PROPFEMALE > McGinley = one of the best nights ever ! 
Okay , I'm officially old . Delino DeShields , Jr. got drafted tonight . When the son of a guy who was in the majors when you were 10 gets drafted , it's a little weird . 
Why does < PROPFIRST > Pronger look like a member of the cast of Anchorman in this pregame interview ? 
Drinking Stone Brewery IPA , watching the Blackhawks win the < PROPMALE > Cup , and less than 40 hours until the opening kick for the World Cup ! It's a good day ! 
Kane ! What a shot ! 
Wow , the Greeks are playing like garbage . 
Way to not show up Greece ... 
Oh Spain , every international competition I think it's your time , and then you go and do something like losing to the Swiss despite outshooting them 24-8 . You're like the Cubs of international soccer . 
On football media blackout from 9 AM today until\ 
whenever I watch the US - Slovenia game tomorrow morning . 
Media blackout is over , and what a terribly officiated game that was . That being said , can we score first for once ? I'm tired of this playing from behind crap . 
Also , definitely cheering against Slovenia , the played some dirty soccer yesterday . 
T minus 41 hours until next media blackout ( 9 AM CDT - 6 PM CDT Wednesday , 6/23 ) . 
T minus 24 hours until media blackout ( 9 AM CDT to 6 PM CDT ) . 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > , your football team is just one big mess right now ... 
Media blackout is on ! No footie info for about 10 hours please ! 
Hooray , no < PROPFEMALE > or Italy in the knockout rounds ! 
Is\ 
anybody watching Futurama tonight looking to have a couple \ 
of people over ? Our cable is out , they say it's going to be fixed at \ 
8:30 , but we all know how reliable Comcast is ... 
Why is this team so frustrating ? 
When I coach my kids ' soccer teams , I'm emphasizing defense , because the national team clearly does not . 
Does < PROPFIRST > Bocanegra bet on Ghana ? He absolutely gave up on that play ! And he screwed up the last time we played them ! He is such a garbage footballer ... 
Go get the ball you morons ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is an incredible moron . He doesn't want Strasburg in the All-Star game because he's a flavor of the month . Meanwhile , he's pushing for < PROPMALE > Hamilton , who's line was . 281/ . 335/ . 500 going into June and is now . 348/ . 392/ . 617 , which sure looks like a flavor of the month to me ! 
Kind of hoping for a Chilean upset today to make things a little interesting ... 
Dear Sportscenter , there is no point in having the list of topics on the side if you're going to change it every two minutes . Also , thanks for covering Ubaldo Jimenez and < PROPMALE > Nowitzki twice before showing < PROPFIRST > Villa's game winning goal . Also also , \LeBron to wait a week to make his decision\ " does not deserve a five minute segment . " 
The \Don't Stop Me Now\ " scene from < PROPFIRST > of the Dead may be the funniest scene in movie history . " 
Went to Kuma's Corner for the first time last night . Most overrated place in history . Much prefer DMK Burger Bar , they're waaaaay friendlier , it's less expensive and , frankly , they have better burgers . 
Maybe it's the beer talking < PROPFEMALE > , but you've got a butt that won't quit they got these big chewy pretzels that are aljcbyhebxkdb five dollars ? get outta here . 
iTunes is the worst program in the history of man ... 
Stop penalizing Buehrle because he has a great pickoff move , < PROPMALE > umpires ! 
Don't you people know what an effing balk is ?!!! 
I love this video ! I know it's old , but it explains so much about < PROPMALE > Grohl . \

Could < PROPFEMALE > Smith be a bigger moron ? 
I don't care that the Bears won today , < PROPFEMALE > tried his hardest to give away a game to a team that hasn't won a road game in nearly three years . Fire him now and let's move on . 
Feels like fall ... I love it ! 
I love how the College Gameday people shill for whichever university they're at that weekend . 
Who knew pig face tasted so good ? 
So , seriously , Girl and the Goat is an absolute MUST for dining in Chicago . 
This week's Simpsons made me realize how much I miss < PROPMALE > and Jemaine ... :-( 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s kid was FANTASTIC ! Go check out Lukas < PROPMALE > and the Promise of the Real , good stuff ! 
Holy crap , tonight's Farm Aid special guest ... < PROPFIRST > effing < PROPFIRST > ! 
If there was ever an NFL game that nobody deserved to win , it's this one . I hope this ends in a tie , because neither team deserves to win . 
< PROPMALE > who ? < PROPFIRST > Halladay pitched a gem tonight , what a great way to open your postseason career ! 
Anyone in search of a relatively new washer/dryer with an extended warranty on it ? Inquire within ... 
Alright , I'm done studying , as ready as I'm going to be , this time tomorrow night I will be happy to be done . Now , once we're all moved in to Pittsburgh , I will be one happy camper , hopefully have a significant reduction in stress for at least a little while . 
Home , done with ( and very likely passed ) the PE , now it's time to go out to dinner and have a few drinks ! 
I'm so done with the traffic in this city . Bring on Pittsburgh ! 
Thank you Accuradio.com, I had totally forgotten about the song Tangerine Speedo ! 
Let it be known that at 4:10 PM on November 5th it is snowing ( flurries ) in Hammond , IN . 
So , struggling with an 0-7 team when we're coming off a bye week ... Is it time to fire < PROPFEMALE > Smith yet ? 
Weather like this makes me want to play some footie ... 
< PROPMALE > Zook may recruit good athletes , but intelligent they are not . 
How do some of these football announcers get on the air ? When the officials stop the play before the snap for a penalty , it's either a delay of game , false start , or encroachment ! It's not rocket surgery , especially if you played in the NFL ! 
Also , with all this talk of < PROPMALE > Childress being fired , he should be fired for wanting to decline an illegal forward pass penalty , which , in addition to five yards , carries a LOSS OF DOWN ! Is everyone in the NFL a moron nowadays ? 
Accuradio playing The Lost < PROPMALE > of Keeping a Secret while I'm packing = awesome . 
Every time I think < PROPFIRST > Reynolds knows his stuff , he goes and says something ridiculously stupid . He just had a lengthy ramble about how baseball is a team game and the Cy Young should just go to the guy with the best ERA/WHIP/K < PROPFIRST > if their team doesn't win games . What do you want < PROPMALE > to do ? Pitch AND bat in all nine spots ? It's not his fault that the Mariners thought they could win games with that lineup ! 
Thinking of acquiring a 412 area code Google Voice number for our move to Pittsburgh . 412-CallJoe(225-5563 ) is already taken , any other suggestions ? 
Is it possible to be drunk on food ? Because I'm pretty sure I'm drunk on Table 52 goodness right now . 
Man , < PROPFIRST > Malumaleuna is so slow he could play for the White Sox ! 
Dear AT&T , \ 
How is it I get 3 bars in my bedroom at 8:30 AM and 6 hours later I can't get cell service to save my life ? \ 
Angrily yours , \ 
< PROPFIRST > 
I am so done with 2010 , bring on 2011 ! 
Last night as a Chicago area resident , starting life as a Pittsburgher tomorrow ! 
Hello Ohio ! See you in hell Indiana ! 
Per < PROPFEMALE>'s request : Hello Pennsylvania ! See you in hell Ohio ! 
Intended to get up around 7 today so it would be easier to wake up tomorrow and to get as much packing done as possible . 9 is close to 7 , right ? 
So it's official : every player that was offered to me in exchange for < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is now a free agent in my fantasy football league . Granted , he's injured , but I still don't know where I acquired the sign that says \Please offer me crap players in fantasy trades . \"" 
< PROPFIRST > Bilas has supplanted < PROPMALE > Vitale as the ESPN college basketball announcer I dislike the most . Congrats < PROPFIRST > ! 
So just saw < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > doing a Live Links commercial here on Pittsburgh television . Lost really couldn't get her better work than that ? 
Thanks Comcast for making moving so easy . I definitely won't be switching to Verizon the first < PROPMALE > I get ... 
So I think < PROPMALE > Simms would love to spend the rest of his life with his lips permanently attached to < PROPMALE > Belichick's ass ... 
Way to not show up , Bears . Worst 9-3 team ever . 
I've had crazy bus drivers in Chicago , but the lady driving this bus out here is making me fear for my life ! 
Dear < PROPMALE > Weber , \ 
Can we PLEASE stop pissing the game away in the last two minutes ? Why is it that our offense stops doing anything during this time ? The rest of the game we start running the motion offense the moment we cross the midcourt stripe , and during the last two minutes , we hold the ball for 25 seconds before starting the offense . It is aggravating . Please remedy this as soon as possible . \ 
Thanks , \ 
Passed the PE ! 
Dear < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Toro , \ 
Please go back to making Hellboy movies . The first two were awesome and I would like to see you make more of them . \ 
Outshined by Soundgarden rocks my socks . That is all . 
I skip coffee for one day , and the next day I'm buzzed from drinking what I normally drink . Man , I'm such a caffeine lightweight ! 
If you are in Chicago , have no plans either tonight or tomorrow night , and like Super Troopers , I would recommend taking a glimpse at what's going down at Zanies in < PROPFIRST > Hills ... 
< PROPFIRST > Martz , offensive moron . 
If you're going to constantly avoid going out to job sites , maybe structural engineering isn't for you ... 
Yet another game pissed away by the Illini in the last minute . Does < PROPMALE > coach the guys to throw the ball away in the last minute ? 
Thanks opening acts for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , there's an hour or so of my life I'll never get back . 
Chicagoans , time to take advantage of the surfing on Lake Michigan law , 18 foot waves today ! 
I think I'm going to take pictures of the lack of snow here in Pittsburgh and post them as a contrast to the dozens of \Snowmageddon\ " albums I've seen over the last 48 hours . " 
Corned beef hash is man's greatest creation . Whoever said \let's fry up corned beef with potatoes\ " should be given a medal . " 
Remember when Saturday Night Live was funny and not just loud ? 
And can someone tell me what exactly Obama is doing wrong in his foreign policy ? Is it because he hasn't invaded anyone yet ? 
Cee Lo is delightfully crazy . 
Feels like a good day to start running outside again ! 
So it turns out Pittsburgh is significantly hillier than Chicago ... 
For a city at this latitude , Pittsburgh really can't handle snow very well . Less than 8 inches between 5 and 11 last night , and they completely shut down all city buses at 10 PM . It's 7:30 the morning after , and some bus routes , apparently including mine , are still not running . Although I can't tell if mine is running or not because their website is down and calling their phone number results in a busy signal . Ugh ... 
I never thought I'd ever say this , but < PROPMALE > Reznor absolutely deserves an < PROPFIRST > for his work on The Social Network . And yes , I do realize the irony of saying that on Facebook . 
And the < PROPFIRST > goes to ... Nine Inch Nails ! 
And is it bad that I want a Naked Gun bomb-in-the-envelope moment to happen with < PROPFIRST > McConaughey and < PROPFEMALE > Johannson on stage ? 
Thank you very much , jackass on Forbes Ave ., I hope that extra 10 seconds you spent waiting to get into the Armstrong Tunnel was worth speeding through that puddle and drenching me .
