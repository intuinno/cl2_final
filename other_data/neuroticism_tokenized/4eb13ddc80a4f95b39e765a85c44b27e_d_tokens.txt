Woo going to Tahoe this Thursday-Saturday . 
Saturday morning , on our trip to Tahoe a bear broke into our cabin and started eating our food . Comet woke up my Mom and she walked in on the bear . Then my dad woke up and had to scare it away . Then me and BJ woke up from my dad yelling and we watched from the balcony as the bear sat outside the cabin eating Reeses Pieces 10ft below us . \

So I take my history midterm , don't feel great about it , get my score back 83 not good but ok , then I double check my score to make sure my < PROPFEMALE > totaled the score properly . Good news he messed up I really got an 87 . So go to my Professor to get the score changed turns out my < PROPFEMALE > entered my score as a 93 and now I have an 87 . FML 
I hate low priority I seriously can't sign up for any more classes . I never thought that I'd want to take more classes 
Another reminder to all Seniors at Granda ; apply to UC Merced 
So this Soc test says your not gonna get an A on me and I say hell yes I am , cause I'm California , and then I take the test and score comes back and the test is like 85 . And I say wait a minute the rest of the class got like a 59 average so the professors gonna curve it by like 21 points . And that's how I got another 100% in my soc class .
