It's time for a little O.C. 
Errrrrr this semester just needs to be over so I can stop effing worrying about it ... 
Twisted , bent , turned around , does it radiate ? 
The consequence of never having cramps is spending one day out of the year curled into a ball hoping your ovaries don't explode .. today is that day . 
So I know it's been 4 years and I'm a little late but .. I just finished the 3rd season of the O.C. and I'm too sad to even start the 4th one .. stupid horomones have me crying WAYY too much . 
Relay for life :) :) let me know if you would like to donate to my team !!

Okay , it's nap time for me 
It disgusts me how we are killing our Earth . Why don't we use our money , time and effort to start finding alternative fuels instead of having oil rigs spill millions of gallons into the Gulf of Mexico while people are losing jobs and animals are dying .
