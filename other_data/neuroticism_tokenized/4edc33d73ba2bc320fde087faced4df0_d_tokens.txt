Dalai Lama Theoretically , one could imagine a situation where armed intervention at an early stage might prevent large-scale conflict . The problem is that it is very difficult , if not impossible , to predict the outcome of violence . That it will be just is not guaranteed at the outset – it will only become clear in hindsight . The only certainty is that where there is violence , there is always and inevitably suffering .

I was only in the Marines for a short time it had a profound influence on my life . Teaching me discipline , responsibility and self respect . I received all the benefits and none of the liabilities .... my eyes were forever opened to the realities of what it means to be a member of the armed service . We as civilians hold the power to decide ; who gets the benefit and who pays the price . Choose wisely .

There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So ... love the people who treat you right , and pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE . Getting back up is LIVING . ~ Re-post if you agree ~ ?

Through constant familiarity , we can definitely establish new behavior patterns , using our tendency to form habits to our advantage . If we make a steady effort , I think we can overcome any form of negative conditioning and make positive changes in our lives . But we need to remember that genuine change doesn't happen overnight .
