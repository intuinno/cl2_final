A high of 36 degrees today & < PROPFEMALE > . Burrrrr ! 

Sad about leaving all my friends here , excited to go back to California , loving my sweet new ride ! =) 
still packing , running errands , making calls , canceling memberships & utilities , getting ready for the long drive , and heading to work tonight . 
... my last night at Baptist ER ... sniff . 
Goodbye to my friends at Baptist ! I miss you all so much already ! 
Getting settled in Oceanside , enjoying a few days off before starting work on Monday . Can't wait until the furniture arrives . 
Unpacking box after box after box ... and then working this weekend . Life never slows down , only speeds up . 
... hates starting a new job ... again . SOOO bad at learning names . 
Looking forward to hanging out with Georgi all this next week ! =) 
Did something tonight I've NEVER done before ... give a patient a ride home at 4am . It's ok , I had my reasons . 
Rabbit , Rabbit world !!! =) 
Headed up to Newport Beach to see old friends ! =) 
\Sookie is mine \"" 
making muffins . going back to bed soon , gotta get better before work tomorrow night . 
Why , oh why must I wait TWO weeks between True Blood episodes ??? Stupid Labor Day . 
Can't wait to pick up Danger on Friday with Hills & < PROPMALE > ! I LOVE PUPPIES !!! =) 
I love Scooby-Doo Bandaids 
gettin ' ready for VEGAS !!! 
Timberlake , < PROPFEMALE > Keys , < PROPFIRST > Swift , Snoop Dog , Timberland , < PROPFEMALE > , TLC ... amazing concert ! 
Ug ! why did I leave Vegas just to come back to work ??? B-A-D idea ; should stayed in Vegas & struck it < PROPMALE > playing Black < PROPFIRST > . 
Working only 3 12s a week is leaving me restless . But at the same time , I really don't feel like working any more than that . Hmmm ... 
Yuck , I hate playing real estate agent as a second full-time job . This is why I'm in the medical field ... advertising , screening applicants , fielding phone calls , credit checks , lease agreements ... NOT for me . 
I'm really sick of spending hours and hours cleaning the kitchen just to have it trashed within 20 < PROPFEMALE > . I'm gonna start putting the dirty dishes left out on people's pillows ! Ok , not really , but its fun to think about . After approx 5 total hours of cleaning it this weekend , I'm officially on kitchen-cleaning strike . 
Household Maid ... again ..... and I'M the one who worked all night . How does this work ? Luckily < PROPFIRST > is a clean-freak , too & picks up after himself . 
Ate breakfast , took a walk , did house stuff , going to lunch with a friend , gonna take a nap , and then off to work again . 
Anyone have an extra ENPC book ? 
Finished ENPC , ran a bunch of errands , about the run some more , and psyching myself up to be on call till 3AM . Oh , and doing all the odds & ends to move to North < PROPFEMALE > in a couple of weeks . Oh , and trying to find something to wear to the < PROPFEMALE > Corps Ball Thursady , AND getting ready for out-of-town guests on Thursday . Whew ! Busy week . 
Why did ALL my patients want to brawl last night ?!?! There was something in the air . 
Finally made it to North < PROPFEMALE > after many fun days of cleaning in Pensacola & buying new pool liner & painting .... $ 4,000 later and now to find somewhere to live here . Gotta love starting out with $ 4,000 less than expected during a move . 
THANK YOU , everyone , for the birthday wishes & making me feel loved ! =) Happy holidays ! 
Yay ! Got the job in Wilmington ! 
So , we got a porche today . =) I was 5 years old when it was made , but it looks newer than me . 
Goin ' to the beach ! Yes , its 47 degrees , but we don't care . 
So Anubis tried to take the giant metal newspaper stand for a walk today , much to my dismay . He dragged it , with me on top , all the way across the parking lot until I was able to calm him down . I hope Port City Java lets us come back ever , ever , ever . * Note to self : don't tie him to anything ever again . *

Missing < PROPFEMALE > San < PROPMALE > !!! =) 
HAIR was great ! \Let the sunshine in\ " but not the bum from the cold . I hate to see such hypocrisy . " 
Idealism is what precedes experience . -- < PROPFIRST > T Wolf 
We got renters in the Florida house ! YAY !!! 
Missing my favorite < PROPFEMALE > & SO sad not to make it down for Mardi Gras this year ! =( 
After an hour , Anubis has finally stopped barking at the snow . Maybe once it's light out , he'll actually go play in it ...? 
Yep , for lent I'm giving up Zucchini , Mushrooms , Onions , Tomatoes , Asparagus , Cabbage , Lettuce , Cucumber , and Eggplant . 
Guns kill people like pencils misspell words 
Property managers are evil ... from both the home owner and the renter's perspective . 
Has anyone used < PROPFEMALE > Tax Services , and if so , would you recommend them ? I've been offered a significant discount through my employer , but I'm learning to do everything by referrals lately . 
Ah ... slept in til 1:30 , ate Special K in the 66 degree < PROPFEMALE > day , took the dog for a nice long jog , sipping on a skim chai my sister-in-law brought me , and now time to start thinking about getting ready for work tonight . At least it was a refreshing weekend . 
Leaving the house for the first time since Tuesday morning ... to go get my car that's been sitting at work this whole time . Poor < PROPFEMALE > . 
Sweet acidophilus milk , where or where do North Carolinians keep you ? Not at Food Lion . We'll try < PROPMALE > Teeter next , then perhaps Fresh Market . 
Can't WAIT to go to DC for < PROPFIRST>'s Bachelorette Party !!!!!!! =) 
I'm ready to be a house wife/full-time student . I'm pretty tired of work these days . 
RABBIT RABBIT to all !

Goodbye Mr. Bear . You have been my best < PROPMALE > since I was 14 . Some of my best memories of home involve laying over the heater vent & you ALWAYS curled up next to me . You are the most selfless , kind , gentle dog I have ever met , and I will love & miss you forever . 
Mr. Bear u are an icon & everyone who knew u loved u despite your many foul smells . Even the person who liked u least carved a life sized Mr. bear head in stone 
I will never ever ever ever ever drive in D.C. alone it without in-dash GPS again . Finally made it to BWI after a near mental breakdown .

So , who else misses Four Winds International Deli/Market ??? How about Flounders ? Mugs & Jugs ? Burtonwood block parties ? 
How had I not seen < PROPFIRST > Darko before ? Weird-ass movie , but SO SO good !

Attended my first day of public school EVER today ! =) It wasn't so scary as adventist schools made it sound . lol . 
I just woke up STILL tired , hungry & grumpy from work last night . I need a pick-me-up . 
Is it sad that I'm dreading the weekend & wish it was perpetual school just so I didn't have to go in to work ? 
SUPER psyched for the wedding in SD this weekend & seeing everyone I've missed so much ! =) 
Time to log off and study ... I wasted 3 hours on here last night , and here I am , wasting MORE time when I have a test tomorrow . Dang Facebook addiction 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > . Today is the big day & I wish them the best !!! Par-tay long ! :) 
Back to the daily grind 
A positive attitude may not solve all your problems , but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort . 
So , today Nature really wanted to make itlself known ... just a strange day that started w/ hearing deer calls from all sides of the woods around me during my 5:30 am run , my dog throwing up , a turtle crossing the parking lot on campus holding up traffic , THEN a family of geese crossing a main highway holding up traffic , and finally two giant dragon flies connected at the hip sitting on my windshield for 5 or 6 blocks . 
A run at 9:30 am is VERY different than a run at 5:30 am !! I thinking I nearly killed my dog and myself ... oh , and then locked myself out of the house . There's a wasted hour of my life I'll never get back . =) lol

So I think I've found that my limit for sitting in the library doing math is right around 8 hours solid ... especially since I ran out of snacks like 6 hours ago . I'm so glad that the math service ( and online textbook ) I purchased to use for all of 5 weeks has been down the past 2 days & will be down the rest of the weekend ... so here I sit ... 
So today I happened to look out my back window just in time to see a 3 foot black snake VERY rapidly slithering from one end of my yard to the other while being chased & pecked by two birds !!! I don't think I could have run as fast as he moved !! 
I think I'm the only 269 spouse that didn't leave town while the guys are away this month . 
$h ! + my engine light came on !! That is literally the LAST thing I need right now . 
That's some bad hat , < PROPMALE > . 
I think I'll mix it up for dinner tonight and have Grape Nuts instead of Shredded Wheat . 
I've discovered that having your own inside joke with yourself is quite cathartic . 
“We the willing , led by the unknowing , are doing the impossible for the ungrateful . We have done so much , with so little , for so long , we are now qualified to do anything , with nothing . ” ... but wait , now we need to do more ... with even less . Somewhere along the way , the math doesn't compute . 
I hate log .

Dear California : thank you for seat covers in every public restroom . Oh , how I've missed you ...

Who thinkgs Machete looks terrible but wants to go see it anyway ? 
Who would have thought calculating a standard deviation could be so much fun ?!?! 
Oh no ! Anubis is acting strange ! He must be sensing the approaching hurricane ! Oh wait , Anubis always acts strange . Never mind . False alert . 
Melting Pot , where have you been all my life ??? 
Love the game but I'm already tired of football posts . 
Nothing like coming home from work in the middle of the night to a fountain shooting out of the well pump , getting drenched trying to shut it off , no water in the house , having been awake for 24 hours & still waiting for the plumber ... this SUCKS !!! I was supposed to get to bed early this morning so I could study all afternoon & evening ! LAME , LAME , and again I say LAME ! 
Why do we consider the weather boring to talk about ? It changes everything , whether its a < PROPFEMALE > day , blizzard or hurricane , it evokes sentimental feelings , and dictates what holiday we're looking forward to . How can that be boring ? 
Uh-oh ... I hope this isn't a migraine brewing ... 
Ahhh , a beautiful start to a fresh new day ... freshly ground coffee , shredded wheat , & toast topped with avocado slices dashed with coarse kosher salt ... and a very heavy dog head resting in my lap . Up next , a morning jog , and then back to the books . And SO grateful the migraine is gone . 
Happiness is Christmas decorations coming out at Costco & eating enough samples you don't have to eat lunch ! Happiness is not driving in Fri afternoon traffic . 
I didn't realize I'd need waders to get to class today . 
What if \Bird\ " ISN'T the word ??? * gasp * " 
TMI > TLI 
My husband just tried to compare Jersey Shore to Moulin Rouge .... WHAT ?!?!?! Ok , one completely lacks any class or intelligence , the other is a creative expression of forbidden love , frustration & passion . I see no similarity , except the involvement of hookers 
Sitting here at a stop light & I can see 5 people smoking In their cars ... I call that job security (& gross ) . 
Has anyone ever sneezed in their sleep ? I was just thinking about it , and I can't recall ever doing so ... and I'm pretty sure that would be the kind of thing to wake one up . 
Oooook , so ... who votes I go blonde again ? I think I've held out as long as I can . I'm really leaning towards blonde , no matter the votes , =) not gonna lie . 
Really ??? The grocery store is closed ?!?! The pharmacy ? The gas station ? The < PROPFEMALE > Corps base .... But I bet the ER is still open !!!! =) 
I'm so glad I drove 20 minutes & walked another 20 minutes for 9 minutes of class ! An email would have sufficed .
