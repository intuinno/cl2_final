suburgatory ( n . ) : place where bimbo meets limbo ; lol who knew such words existed 
Society is the mirror of the proud-Aristotle ; Why do we < PROPFEMALE > nice cars , fancy homes , prestigious colleges , & immense wealth ? Society depicts it to be , & humans simply follow . Are we not free to define our own success ? Forget peer pressure , what of status quo & societal pressures ? Is this what we live so hard to strive for , to merely imitate the reflection of the proud ? Does this not bring us back to the very classical saying , always be yourself ? Ironically , we are taught all our lives , to not . 
Does possessing an expensive product increase your worth ? Most certainly not . The only thing it does increase is your billing statement . But we own them anyway , thinking it to be worthwhile for the mere delight of having attained the standards set by the proud . The proud constantly boasts its reflection . I say go find a new mirror . 
I love Scooby Doo . <3 
WENT FROM SIZE 3 TO SIZE 1 JEANS SAY WHATTT 
Interracials are so effing hot . < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > Tsang <3 SIGHHHH
