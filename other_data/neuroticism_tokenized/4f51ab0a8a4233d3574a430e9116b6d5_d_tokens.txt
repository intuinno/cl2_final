It's better to give than to recieve . It's better to bless and pray for , than to curse and condem . It's better to be honest rather than to lie . It's better to have faith in everything/everyone than turn away from them . It's better to love than to hate . It's better to be positive than it is to be negative . It's better to be patient and take one thing at a time rather than rush through and do poorly on . 

Is it being a creeper , or is it really just being a gentleman/lady ? Is it being a stalker , or is it really just being a caring/concerned friend ? Is it stupidity , or is it really just ignorance ? Is it being obnoxious , or is it really just a cry for attention ? Is it sadness , or is it just the lack of love ? 
I'll stand by you , won't let you down/ I've got your back , no need to frown/ When night is day and day is night , I'll be there , your bright light knight/ No need to cry nor separate , I'm your friend , your bright light knight/ May we eternally dance our lives together , in our beloved friendship manner/ In this manner we waltz away , the manner of The Bright Light Knights . 
Dear human race , No matter much you beg or pry , you cannot bribe me . I would never betray my friends ' and family's trust so stop trying . No matter how much you try I won't ever smoke nor drink due to the vast amounts of pain it has indirectly afflicted to my family and I , so stop trying . No matter how much you tempt me , however strong the urge , you won't change me unless it's for the better . 
Therefore , as God's chosen people , holy and dearly loved , clothe yourselves with compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness and < PROPFEMALE > . Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another . Forgive as the Lord forgave you . And over all these virtues put on love , which binds them all together in perfect unity . Colossians 3:12 - 
On this day , I see clearly now , the path that's spread before me/On this day , I will give myself , to love and to nurture/On this day , I'll devout my life , to do His will and cause/On this day , anywhere , any time , any way , I'll give myself for Him/On this day , my whole life , I won't deny His love/On this day , I shall join the Body of One . 
Some say I'm a dreamer , but I can't be the only one . Imagine all the people living in < PROPFEMALE > . All together , happy , and strong . After all , in time all we are is dust in the wind . Nothing last forever ; except actions of love and kindness . That is why I'm a dreamer , and I most certainly am not the only one . 
You are to fire as I am to water/You make the < PROPFEMALE > as I form the compliar/You burst with passion as I flood with compassion/You smelt the Earth as I tend it's garden/You give love as I give life/Together we mix to compile some tricks/And in these tricks we fix our kicks . -The Balance of Nature I ( MAT )

Earth nurishes the roots / Wind drops the fruits / and the circle is repeated . Earth builds mountains / Wind shapes canyons / and the land drifts anew . Earth causes fissures / Wind makes us quiver / and together we are depleted . Earth is seismic / Wind is cosmic / and together they are true . -The Balance of Nature II ( MAT ) 
Dear God , < PROPMALE > me the serentity to accept the things I cannot change - The courage to change the things I can - And the wisdom to know the difference . 
It's not easy being a n o-o ne . Who can you always count on ? N o-o ne . Who's always picking up after everyone else's slack ? N o-o ne . Who would gladly sacrifice themself for others ? N o-o ne . Who puts others before themself ? N o-o ne . N o-o ne . Who is always there for you when needed most ? N o-o ne . Who , even in a foul mood , would always do their very best to aid others ? N o-o ne . Who doesn't hesitate to offer assistance ? N o-o ne . 
is often misunderstood . It's just something we learn to adapt to and move on . Besides , being misunderstood isn't always a bad thing ... other than most people's first impression of you being intirely wrong .... if they even give you a < PROPMALE > . 
It's funny how so many people quote Christ in their sayings yet so few quote Him with their actions . HAVE AND GIVE BOTH HOPE AND LOVE . The world will be so much better when all of our corruption is purged . LET GO AND LET GOD . Until that time arrives , I'll do my part to help everyone despite what they all say and think . DON'T LET OTHER'S CHANGE WHO YOU ARE . 
It came upon the morning sun that His will shall be done / then we'll raise our hands and yell , ' God be praised!' / It came upon the evening mist , that the devil himself was surely pissed / that we all ascended to the heavens and yelled , ' Allah be praised!' / It came upon the heavenly sky , to the < PROPFEMALE > gates of yor ' / then and there He greeted us as we said , ' LORD BE PRAISED . ' 
The human heart may indeed be the deadliest weapon , but it is also the most potent healer . 
I am an Angel / I am a Demon / I care for others , yet without reason / I love no one / I hate no one / I simply am a Guardian -MAT ( The Bastion ) 
\You come to love not by finding the PERFECT person .. but by seeing an IMPERFECT person PERFECTLY \"" 
\You can't expect to find the right someone until you\ 
You can't expect to solve any dispute or situation without looking at it from all points of view . You must not only be straightforward , but also learn and accept the opinions and ideas of those who are involved directly , indirectly , and even the spectators . Only then will a dilema be fully solved and all can move on . 
Happiness isn't found IN what or who you have ; Rather , it is being CONTENT with what or who you have . 
Humans are strange beasts that will never be understood . That is just one of the many wonders and beauties of humanity . 
My friend , \Adriana Macchione\ " -- Fact of Life -- After every Monday and Tuesday even the calendar says ' wtf ?! '" 
Oh brilliant Night Sky / For ever bright Night Sky / You look at us with sympathy / forever granting us empathy / Cool wind blows / < PROPFEMALE > light glows / Forever watching over our souls / For in the dark it is known / that we are truly renown / Not by humanity / rather by His Majesty / The Full < PROPFEMALE > becons the lone wolf's howl / Thereby re-instating Our bond is greater than the acursed Red Fowl . -MAT \Night Sky \"" 
My poems have meaning / They aren't just a jingle / They're an < PROPMALE > with a purpose / with a message so wonderous / If you can't quite grasp it / then allow me to jest / Each poem comes at my very best / I pour my he < PROPMALE > into the meaning / I give my soul to each reading / It might be unclear / but don't just guess / It has its secretes only the best can ingest . -MAT ( My Poems ) 
' s highlight of the day : Watching a giant Prey-Mantis decappitate and eat another bug . AWESOME !!! 
' s highlight of the day : having a two hour conversation with my newly met friend , < PROPFEMALE > Grubbs 
Yesterday's highlight : Volunteering for the \Run UWG \"." 
hasn't done it in a while , so what the heck ? Highlight of the day this time is very deserving . This is the third time it has happened to me so far . This is for all you animal lovers out there . A squirl , and not just any squirl , a baby squirl , ran up my leg , across my back , and perched itself on my shoulder . I look at it , it looks back at me . Next thing I know I have a curled up fur ball taking a nap on my shoulder . 
' s highlightS : Service , service , and more service all day mixed with only having my favorite class this semester today . Got to do the Thriller dance along with the Macharaina and improvs for the Monster mash and Cotton-Eye < PROPFIRST > . Gave < PROPFEMALE > out to kids plus set up , cleaned up , and packed up booths , and was able to hand out all the free UWG promotional items and keep my sanity all day .

Happy birthday/anniversary APO !!! 85 years of fellowship , leadership , and service going strong ! APO for life !!! 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with CRAZY people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart ... They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are . ? 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > . May God comfort your father and your remaining friends and family . You will always be remembered as a great man , an honest , caring ,, friendly , and helpful person , and most importantly , a great son , brother , brother-in-law , worker , and friend . I had fun being with you , even if we only just met last semester . You will be missed , but you will always be loved and remembered .

So International Night at UWG was cool . There was cuisine from around the globe ( made by internationals of course ) , African Drummers , Belly Dancers , and ........ < PROPFIRST > Cullen ............ Turns out he's French . Go figure . I'm just dissapointed that there wasn't a Brazilian < PROPMALE > there to start a Team < PROPFIRST > vs . Team < PROPMALE > fight ..... Swedish style . 
Behold the power of love and friendship . I'm so lucky to have the people I know in my life . I'm still in awe at how the human heart is both the deadliest weapon and the most potent healer . Whatever happens , I wish you all great happiness and love . * Enter nerd < PROPFIRST > * Live long and prosper . 
I dare you- ( XC }: P{D3 ) -> How many happy faces can you find ? <- * HINT There's at least 20 ! * : Think outside the bun : 
Is it funny or sad that although I'm in college , a lot of students have the maturity of elemtary students ?... 7th graders at best ... Calling them High Schoolers would be over-qualifying them while insulting real High Schoolers . Note- Since today was \Hug a Short Person Day\ " and I saw very few of you ... You all get a Flying Ninja Hug ( that was for you < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ) since you're all shorter than me :P " 
So today in Biology Lab I got to dissect ( FINALLY !!! ) a fetal pig . Then I got to handle a sheep brain . Guess what I said before I took off my gloves ?............................... Ready ?.............................................................................................................. SMELL MY FINGER !!! :) 
The girl you just called fat ? She is starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours in the mirror putting on makeup hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? Is abused enough at home . There's more to people than you think . Make this your status if you're against bullying 
It's the simple things in life that really help make a difference . I'm so happy to have the things I never dreamt I'd have and that so many other people truly need and deserve . 
Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post this for 1 hour . Do it for all !! I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . 
Had to replace my old phone , but the contacts didn't transfer :S If you can , please message me your phone < PROPFIRST > ( let me know whether or not to message you mine ) . Hope everyone had a great weekend and an < PROPFEMALE > Easter/Global Sphere Day (???) !!!
