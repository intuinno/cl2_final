well ... tried to see the total lunar eclipse ( for hours ) :-( damn clouds . That's too bad because the last time a total lunar eclipse occurred on the first day of solstice was 372 years ago . Will never happen again in our lifetime . On the bright side ... at least a werewolf didn't jump out of the woods and get me . I was making enough noise in the snow clomp clomp clomp , lol . 
He puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore . Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before . Maybe Christmas , he thought , doesn't come from a store . Maybe Christmas ... perhaps ... means a little bit more !
