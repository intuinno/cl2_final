We're all a little lost inside . 

There's no way to be a hundred percent sure about anyone or anything . So you're left with a choice . Either hope for the best , or just expect the worst . 
God is the only friend you always have to count on .

Strength lies in differences . 
Who we are isn't so much about what we do , but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it .

I'm tired of people being ugly to each other . I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world everyday . There's too much of it . It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time . 
If you don't get lost , there's a < PROPMALE > you may never be found . 
biggby's! 
That's the way things come clear . All of a sudden . And then you realize how obvious they've been all along . 
BIGpickles 
the simplest questions are the most profound . 
so pumped for the weekenddd !!! packing (: 
Holding anger is a poison . It eats you from inside . We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us , but hatred is a curved blade . And the harm we do , we do to ourselves . 
Well life gets hard and life gets tough . But sometimes you gotta find a little bit of truth amongst all the lies and know everything will be alright .. 
i NEED summer . now . 
you know its a good day when it smells like spring (: 
if you're patient , things will turn out right in the end . 
school's a waste of time .. 
being full of yourself only leaves you empty . 
there is nothing better than falling asleep to the sound of rain . 
Life's too short to have enemies . I make no apologies for being friendly . 
old pictures and music . 
memphis in may ! 
it would be a shame to waste a day like this . 
loves < PROPFEMALE > 
i'm really gunna miss the senior class ..

GOD IS SO GOOD . 
will never be too cool to sport a christmas sweater at school . 
AT < PROPFEMALE > Carpentier ' S BIRTHDAY DINNNER ! 
there's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy . 
not all who wander are aimless . 
Sometimes the questions are complicated , and the answers are simple . 
discover the miraculous in the common . 
i wish we could just say what we mean , find the right words to say it , and not care what would happen if we let our guards down once in a while . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > changed our world , and we can't even respect that ?! what is this world coming to .. -RSK 
You've got troubles , well I've got ' em too . \ 
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you . 
The early bird gets the worm , but the second mouse gets the cheese . 
wheres the chapstick !? 
I will rise when he calls my name . no more sorrow , now more pain . 
As a rule , man is a fool . \ 
When it is hot , he wants it cool . \ 
And when it is cool , he wants it hot . \ 
Always wanting what is not . 
who we are isn't so much about what we do , but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it . 
Dear < PROPFIRST > Crawford and < PROPFEMALE > Crawford , just wanted to let you know i'll love you always & will never forget you ! LOVE CHELSEA <3 \ 
P . S . now that i've experienced a crawford sandwich , my life is complete .
