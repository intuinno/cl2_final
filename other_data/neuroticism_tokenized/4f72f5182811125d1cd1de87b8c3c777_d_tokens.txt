Only 2 more classes until finals . 
Two finals tomorrow . 
has retuned to MSOE 
\I could use a tornado right about now monkey wizard ! \"" 
Why doesn't the Java String class have a reverse method ? Fail . 
Got my book on computer architecture - great stuff ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Just got to round 119 on bloons tower defense 4 on the first track on hard . 4th place :) for the day .

Transistors ftw ! 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has AUTISM . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand Autism IS NOT a disease ; people with Autism are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE ...... 93% won't Copy and Paste this .... will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
Fellow Citizens , we cannot escape < PROPFIRST > Feilbach Embedded systems lab ftw 
is writing code to read from a temperature sensor and is very excited that the electronics work correctly . 
The inventor of the three pronged electric outlet was an MSOE graduate . Cool ! 
I love it when code just works the first time you test it . 
DE2-70 board is here ! 
Stupid watchdog ... 
Classes cancelled after 5 PM . No calculus tonight ! 
Love by Angels and Airwaves is good so far 
Happy Single's Awareness Day 
One 2 hour sitting , 700 lines of VHDL , 1 very minor error . Woot ! 
Keyboard controller works - second microprocessor is much closer to being done now :) 
First super < PROPFIRST > 64 speed run 16 hours and 53 minutes . Second : 8:53:50 . 
Microprocessor performs instruction fetching correctly and instruction decoding nearly correctly . 
I'm creating a \ < PROPMALE > Roller\ " . The idea behind it is that the cables from an XBOX or other gaming console are plugged into a board that is controlled by a remote . Normally the board will allow the audio and video to go straight to the TV however when a button on the remote is pressed it will change the video and audio to a movie of < PROPMALE > Astley's \ " Never Gonna Give You Up\ " . What does everyone think of this ? " 
CUrrent microprocessor is 5,284 lines of VHDL ... and counting . 
do { findbug (); stomp (); } while ( currentLocation . get () = = CC . THIRD_FLOOR ); 
Computer architecture always seems to put me in a good mood . 
Just finished creating a huge spreadsheet of control signals to find the error that occurs when my CPU tries to branch only to realize my full adder was designed incorrectly . 
Waiting for my data structures lab to finish . 
Source transforms = awesome . 
Mechanical engineers have the best ideas - like golfing in the hallway . 
According to my data sturctures class , a tiger is a small brown rodent . 
loves C 
Attention Facebook : No one takes you seriously if you can't spell . 
Has a working SSRAM controller for the DE2-70 FPGA development board ! 
One nanosecond can make an entire world of difference . 
If you \like\ " this I'll post something on your wall I like about you . Make this your status if you want a challenge . " 
Can read/write to SDRAM 
Wrote a bit over 2,000 lines of VHDL today for my computer . Total lines so far is at 6,600 with a thousand or two more in prototypes and testers . Quite a productive day ! 
Listening to the inception soundtrack and doing some computer architecture . Great night !

Data cache is nearly working :) 
\Info : Physical synthesis algorithm register retiming complete : estimated slack improvement of 1 ps\ 
Is surprised how many people mix up your and you're . 
Likes gmail's new look 
Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday ! 
Data cache finally works again !

The < PROPMALE > , Obama insists , aren't paying their \fair share . \ " This by itself seems odd given that the top 1% of Americans pay 40% of all federal income taxes ; the next 9% of income earners pay another 30% .

Got a buy one get one free coupon for Qdoba and took @ < PROPMALE > Connor with me . We both expected to pay $4 but after my card was swiped it turns out that I became eligable for a free burrito . Since it was a buy one get one free both < PROPMALE > and I paid nothing for two burritos . 
Has beaten Halo Reach . 
Is home for most of the weekend . 
Partial derivatives have been exceedingly useful this week . 
Loves finding an integrating factor for a nonexact linear differential equation that is simple and makes the differential equation easy to solve ! 
They need to make a datasheet for women . 
Why would anyone create a digital to analog converter whose output is current instead of voltage ? 
is minoring in Mathematics .

Why are Software Development II and Embedded Systems I still under My Courses in Blackboard ?? I took those classes over a year ago ... 
Is in need of a pinecone or cactus and a four dimensional cake for Discrete Math . 
In physics today we played with electricity and water . 
Apple pie is so yummy . 
Who still plays FarmVille ? 
If tomatoes are a fruit does that mean ketchup is a smoothie ?

Thinks that compiler theory is incredibly interesting . 
Has 2^9 friends on Facebook . Now , if only I could get 512 more ! Then I'd be using up an entire 4 KB in Facebook's databases ( assuming each person is given a 4 byte id and they don't compress their databases ) . 
The Windows 7 calculator can do natural logs in scientific mode . That was cool -- I didn't have to find my TI-89 !

Why must the internet be so slow ?!?! 
Women do not satisfy superposition . They are nonlinear . 
It sure is satisfying when you can get your ATmega32 to talk with your computer . Time for sleep .
