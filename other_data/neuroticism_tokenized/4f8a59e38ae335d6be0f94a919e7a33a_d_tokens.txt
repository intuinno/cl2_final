Conquering my own automotive ignorance ... And with help of course ... I have completed the conquest of the alternator . My car lives once more !

I've done it ! I've finally invented a time machine ! I am now capable of jumping forward in time ! Unfortunately the speed is a paltry one second per second .

Well , I have returned from the KY Fruit and Vegetable Conference . Lots of information for the coming year .
