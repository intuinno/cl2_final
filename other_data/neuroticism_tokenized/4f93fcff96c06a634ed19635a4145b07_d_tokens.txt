Isnt it weird how everyone is bored as soon as break starts ? 
You can blow off all your dark Desires , and you can tell yourself you tried . Fortune cookies will always take your side , but you will crumble from their lies . Desires won't die . 
Never stand ankle deep in water at midnig . The mermaids will come and eat the redhead . 
Looong day ... CALL ME < PROPFEMALE > ! I has a present for you that I need to give before I leave =3 
Playing with my new gifts and getting ready for -shudders- PICTURES . > _O Who's screwed up idea was that ? 
Octopus , you say one word and I'll turn your butt into freaking SUSHI . >_> 
The only way to contact me from tomorrow till Saturday is gonna be over the internet , but if I have it my way I'll be on plenty ~ ! 
Never inject yourself with an unknown super-chemical if the needle looks more like a tube . The fat man will blow down the wall and you'll drown like they did in 2012 . 
Shh ... You hear that ? Thats the sound of forgiveness . Thats the sound of people DROWNING , < PROPFIRST > !!! That's what forgiveness sounds like . Screaming and then silence . 
I dont want tomorrow to cooome .... U_U 
The crazy nature lafy on the horse ? Avoid her . You'll argue EVERY TIME YOU MEET , and then you'll be late for scary story time . That's bad becasue during story time , the mermaids will come and steal the red-heads and you wont be there to slap them silly . 
SOMEBODY IS ABOUT TO DIE . I AM NOT . FREAKING . HAPPY .

Kyo's Hinata plushie JUST CAME IN ... Its amazing . You want pictures ? 
I be making < PROPFEMALE>'s cookies now .... Omnomnom . 
Today I'm gonna back and watch all the old anime's that stuck in my mind and made me a rabid fanpairing fangirl ... But even seasons only . Experience tells me that odd seasons SUCK . 
Been recoloring stuffs for a Ladysatamon for 2 DAYS FREAKING STRAIGHT ... I hate Microsoft paint . 
I hate swimming ... 
\You're just like this spare guy that's around all the time- Your such a SPARE !! \ " \ " KILL THE SPARE ! \ " Very Potter Musical . Youtube it . Love the epic Draco fails and the amazing flaming gayness of Quirrell . " 
Spent the ast three hours watching A Very Potter Musical OwO Now I really wanna know- What the FLIPSTICK is a Hufflepuff and why is < PROPMALE > the minister ? 
I REALLY want to go back and watch all the Potter movies , but I have to get up tomorrow ... Darn . 
Ha . Aha . AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!! > D God , I feel good . Nothing like crushing the spirit of a retarded , contradictory , illiterate roleplayer ... Which I havent done in two years . BUT THIS IDIOT DESERVED IT AND I FEEL LIKE DANCING . AHAHAHAHAHA ! 
Happy New Year , people ! I'm still up ... Mr. < PROPMALE > Oum threw us a bone and I've been chewing on it ( SQUEALING ) for about 3 hours now . =]

Anyone want me to draw their Gaia ? -BORED- 
Akaku , Akaku , Akaku yurete yumeno yumeno hate e . Hanarerarenai . 
Writing out ' Sexy Vampire ' in Kanji using the translator . I'm just that bored . MAKE A WISH . 
All this Kanji and no one to talk to ... -sigh- 
Hi Miss < PROPFEMALE > What kind of dreams do you see with your eye of glass ? Do they enchant you ? 
When I get online tomorrow , the first thing you need to sayy to me is ' Get your lazy butt off Facebook , Fanfiction , or Gaia and MAKE THOSE COOKIES . D<' Because I'll forget , and then I'll be sad . 
Happy Birthday to Daruto ~ ! DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE AMERICAN IDOL OTAKU ?! MERE . < PROPMALE > . IS . MY . HEROOOOO .... OwO 
Fun , loud , tiring , vaguely depressing , TOTALLY AWESOME party ~ ! And what am I gonna do tomorrow ? Well , not talk because that 2 minute 5-part harmonizing/shrieking we did totally killed my voice >.> 
If anyone else watche HEroes tonight , you shall join me in laughing like a maniac and screaming out ' THE EYEBROWS !! THEY ARE ALIIIIVEEE !!! AND YOU . CANT . KILL THEM . ( Oh , and shame she died , eh ? Watch her come back to life next month!)' 
The llama dictatorship keeps getting screwed up by thoughts of Nija and butterflies =_= * Starts the ninja project she's been putting off since July * 
Riku needs help with somethin from either < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > ... =.= 
Wish my < PROPFEMALE > set had a larger range so I could play TenTen's theme ... 
Dare mo dare mo shiranai himitsu , Ochite ochite ochite . Mou modorenai Tsumi o kizande mo Kitto 
Geuss who found the 7 minute Zeruto AMV ? ... Yeah , I'm not getting any sleep tonight >.> 
You never realize how awesome Yuna actually is until you rewatch the wedding scene . After you choke laughing at the whole ' I can FLYYYY ' thing , she's actually pretty freaking cool . And then the first sending is nice to rewatch , too . She may be the only heroine I don't hate ! 
Is it a bad thing when you watch the Saddest Moments In Videogaming Montage and the only parts that make you cry are when they killed the horse and when Tidus fades in FFX ? ... But really . What kind of sick and twisted person kills the godfreaking HORSE ?! 
I find it funny that in Final Fantasy X , all the characters have American accents except for the bad guy . He's british . And why would anyone name their villain < PROPMALE > ? ' I am < PROPMALE > , Lord of all ! SPIRA MUST DIE!' No . ( < PROPMALE >....) 
You know that feeling when you're doing something really fun but then you see something that makes you think of some random thing and when you go back to what you were originally doing , you find you dont want to be doing it anymore ? And then you feel really bored because you dont want to do anything else , either ? >.< 
I found something to do ! Not exactly prductive though .... unless rewatching all the depressing videogame/anime moments you know of and rating them is productive ? Give me your top 3 ! 
Creating ... 
< PROPFEMALE > got owned by meh < PROPFEMALE > > w < 
Haven't been on in a while .... Sicky-icky DX 
Happy ( < PROPMALE > ) < PROPFIRST>'s Day , people ! Today's the day you can go out and hug your neighborhood demon-possesed alleged vampire < PROPMALE > ! 
Hey , what's that movie called where this couple wins a dream vacation or something and the people they're staying with are actually wanted for murder ?? I wanna go see it .... BUT I CANT REMEMBER WHAT ITS CALLED =_= 
NYAH , GODDEMYX ! THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING ! And by the time < PROPFEMALE > comes back my opportunity might be gone ! Or maybe ... it'll get better ! -Fire in eyes- YOSH ! SOMEONE , ROLEPLAY WITH THE DEAR MAN SO I CAN USE MY UBER-SPECIAL HEALER SKILLZ ! 
-Falls over dead- I HATE THE 200 IM !!! D < 
< PROPFEMALE > , I need your Tinierme name . I MUST KNOW !! 
Our roleplay has turned me into such a crazy plotting ninja ... And now that our plot is complete I seriously cant stop cackling . I FEEL EVIL > D 
< PROPFEMALE > ! < PROPFIRST > tried to reason with me ... I really do LOVE being an all powerful moderator with the verbal skills to smash his self-esteem into the ground > D 
Does < PROPFEMALE > wanna go out for sushi on Friday ? 
I have discvered that the sound I make in my mind when repressing rabid fangirlism sounds like GWISHGWISHGWISH BEEEEEEEEEEEP . The beep tends to last about 3 minutes , or until I get distracted . ... I need a life XD 
< PROPFEMALE > , you lied . =_= 
Making Sea-salt Icecream , As featured in KH2 , 358/2 , Birth By Sleep , Coded , Reverse/Rebirth , etc ... 
Raise your hand if you want to trade parents ! And family ! And most of the people you share blood with ! =D 
XDDD < PROPMALE > Yates has a hate group on Facebook ! ( I'm over here LMAO'ing , by the way ) 
Kingdom Hearts Roleplays , as I have just discovered , send off a beacon that simply screams ' HEY !! IM HERE !! FILL ME UP WITH YAOI AND LEAVE BEHIND A MERE TWO STRAIGHT FEMALES!' Ooh , and looky here . Another potential Yaoi moment participator just sent in his profile ~ ! Oh , what a happy fangirl I am ... 
It is a sad , sad day when your Inner Fangirl starts to think Nnoitra Jiruga is the most awesome thing since Urahara . NOTHING is as cool as Urahara . PERIOD . 
I ... feel creative . I'ma go make paper butterflies or something . 
Wondering why people get bloodspatter on my locker at least once a week ... 
Hair is currently in ( Soewhat failed ) Vanille pigtails ... They go boing ^w^ Also , have you noticed that most of the fun weird hairstyles are pigtails ? Vanille pigtails , Misa pigtails , Utau pigtails , Usagi pigtails , Chibiusa pigtails , blahblahblah ... I'ma try them all eventually , methinks ! 
Sudden and insane urge to draw OCs . Gimme ideas , and gimme them NAO ! 
Still looking for OCS ... On another note , I'm seriously pissed off at everyone who was there when < PROPMALE > got jumped . You people suck . 
... Marathon time . First NCIS , then Bones , then Mr. and Mrs. Smith ( Because I never got to see it T^T ) and then- Woah . Awesome commercial . Who wants to go see Nightmare on Elm Street with me on the- nevermind . Stupid R movies =.= 
Watching murder shows all day and then trying to sleep in a pitch black room with a possesed fridge right below me ? Not happening . 
OHMYGAIA HE MADE ANOTHER DFMV dhdehjzbehkijclkgsSHINY*runfallsit * 
Tomorrow morning I'm going to be an emotional wreck , so dont talk to me or else I'm likely to literally jump up and try to gnaw your head off . 
Why don't people ever question why they're being saved by a man in blue tights with blindingly red underwear that's on the outside and a cape that SHOULD have been destroyed by now ? They just sit there and scream . And stare in awe . And take pictures . Of course , I'd prolly take pictures , too ... New ' Mind Bleach ' anyone ? ( love how no one can say that anymore XD ) 
Two more weeks , and we'll be rid of the Scary Orange Hawaiin Alien forever ... Yay ! 
For those of you in the know ( < PROPFEMALE > ) Xion just applied for Fire Apprentice . Cue my running around happy for about 5 minutes and rolling around a little , all while a tornado is heading this way XD 
Who all is planning on going to Tokyo in Tulsa ? I might go , assuming we get my costume done in time ... ( Shinigami ! Yoruichi of Bleach fame ) 
Hmm ... Suddenly I wonder if I should cosplay next year instead so Kyo won't feel so alone ... or maybe not . Anyways , I'm planning on buying exactly 5 plushies and no less <3 
I have 38 days to rewatch the Bleach , Wolf's Rain , and Death Note in their entirety . In the case of Death Note , I may just go Manga . Regardless , thats over 5 hours of anime a day ... best get working . 
-From now on , all status updates will proooobably be Bleach related . If they're not , tell me to get off my butt and start watching- . Best way to end an episode . EVER . MADE OF WIN . 
-Yachiru obsessing- 
The Australian National Tiyuna/Aurikku/Tikku/Anyotherfanpairingyourtwistedlittlebrainscancomeupwith and FFX/X-2 in general day is next week ~ ! -Watches Wolfs Rain , because she forgot how much she actually hated Ichigo- 
It does NOT feel like Friday ... That means its time to find new roleplays . -sigh- To Tinierme I go , I guess ... >.< 
Sitting here at church , seriously considering entering the Tokyo in Tulsa Fanfiction Contest . Oneshots are my new crack ... 
Tornado time ! > D 
Drowning self in toilet ... 
Tryouts went okay =/ \ 
I'm sorry to say it , < PROPFIRST > , but < PROPMALE > is WAY more awesome than you are . Only he doesn't stretch . You're still special in that way , I guess ! ( Its still gross though >.>) 
Guess who has a new laptop ? 
Aaaaaand .... My City of Heroes account is officially back online ;) 
There is no Watermelon . Therefore , Summer has not yet started . 
I'm dyiiiiiing ... T^T 
Somebody help meeee ... I hate talking to people I DO know , let alone the ones I don't! 
... Now that I've actually seen the game , I realize that the movie is more of an AU of < PROPMALE > of Persia than anything else .... 
I have a bleeping SOCK TAN . -facepalm- 
Everywhere I go by Hollywood Undead is the second worst song you can have stuck in your head . The first being the Zork and Me theme song =.= 
Yes , I am a ninja ( you know what I mean ) all dressed up in black so that I can't be seen ... 
Sudden inexplicable urge to watch an English dub ... Prolly has something to do with this new obsession for the Fanservice Man . 
Things to buy : Another hair straightener , More cat ears ( Tink was intimidated by the last and as such ate them > w > ) , a dog collar , and a collar < PROPFEMALE > . Nyah . 
You know when you find something , look at it , and say ' I don't really need that ' but then like , 3 weeks later you realize that you probably should have gotten it but it's too lat enow ? >.< 
Six more days , people ! -tripsfallsdies- 
All con-goers , I have been asked to advise you all to SHOWER . Nobody likes a smelly Otaku ! 
I had 4 pairs of ears . Somehow they are all MISSING . 
=) 
X3 He said bye ! 
Sadly , < PROPFEMALE>'s mom has my Actor-signing pictures =.= 
Need to go to Hot Topic in a few months ... The black dress and the socks . Then my ( ultra-simple yet strangely never done ) < PROPFEMALE > cosplay shall be done ! ^w^ 
Birthday is on Monday ~ ! 
Going to a Pro Basketball game ... The joy is totally wasted on me =.= Save me ! 
Am I the only one who didn't know Avatar : The Last Airbender came out THIS WEEK ? 
I'm in a pickle = w = 
Just got the Pre-AP English Summer book ... 310 pages of Holocaust romance , here I come ! \ 
( This is going to be the most boring book I have ever read . Please distract me ! ) 
Band next week ! Who's going to the Lock-in ? ( Not me , frigging Memphis ... ) 
We can just wear whatever to uniform fittings , right ? Or is there something specific I don't know about ... 
I still haven't seen The Lord of the Rings ! I feel like a Geek-society failure ... 
My life has been reduced to 4 1/2 hour time slot ... So by that logic Im spending all my life watching tv ! 
Hell Week is almost over ~ School time ! 
Do Skittles catch fire or do they just melt ? Cuz Skittle-colored fire would be the most awesome thing since orange markers ... 
If a nerd and a cupcake had a baby , it would look just like mah lady ~ 
Random rant : I want a Rin Kagamine plushie sooo bad , but she's like $70 dollars and if I got her I would HAVE to buy < PROPMALE > so I could have twins and he costs even more ... I suppose I must settle for the MooMooSuit plush-chan ... T^T 
I am sick on the only 4 day weekend AGAIN . As such , I have been watching anime all day and found my next Riku ( Hint : Looks like Manga ! Fang and rhymes with Moo Panda ) 
Florida tomorrow ~ ! 
< PROPMALE > Potter in < PROPMALE > is HOLYFREAKINGAWESOMEWOW . I have so much Slytherin merchandise it's not even funny ... Also saw a couple people with Very Potter Musical shirts and must go buy some later . \ 
\ 
I'm gonna lay down and die now ... 
It takes going on a vacation to see that home and all the people there that you aren't married to kinda suck >.< \ 
Usually . Sometimes you just kinda know they should fall over and die ... But I think < PROPFIRST > is a special case . 
You can't go anywhere anymore ... Eventually you're just gonna hear someone go ' so I got this new GAME yesterday ... ' and get the sudden urge to yell at someone and tell everyone what they just lost >.< \ 
Gonna sleep now . 
I tried watching Bleach again today . \ 
... Is there a cure for carro t-t op stupidity ? \ 
You win , Japan , now give me back my Death Note D < 
The charter bus has wifi > w < 
I don't wanna go to the Southmoore game tomorrow ... Where is Southmoore , anyway ? 
Supernatural mustv'e had a budget cut ... Their Twilight episode is crap so far =.= 
Can you take an instrument outside when it's raining ? <--- ( Clueless Pit Freshman ) 
How mad do you think Ms. Potter would be if I burned my Biology textbook ...? 
-has a Birth by Sleep addiction- 
Fess up . Who else forgot we had Biology homework until JUST NOW ? 
Today I was watched by a strange and creepy person , attacked violently from two angles outside of the band room , and then kidnapped and forcefully thrown into the trunk of an insane person . \ 
... Band kids are so weird =D 
Not that being a Gemini now isn't fun and all , but really . I was a Cancer for the first 14 years of my life . \ 
I REJECT YOUR REALITY AND SUBSTITUTE MY OWN . 
So ... Final Fantasy XIII-2 . \ 
... Yeah . \ 
( And on a Versus note , why does Noctis sound remarkably similar to Light Yagami ? ) 
I've just developed an unhealthy obsession with Squiby.net >.< \ 
So cuuuute .... 
Biebers HOW OLD today ?!
