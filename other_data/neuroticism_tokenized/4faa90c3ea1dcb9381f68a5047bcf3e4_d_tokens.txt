was just told she was cute by her nephew . He's cuter . :) 
is tired of telling the < PROPMALE > & AJ not to jump on the air matress . Well , if you can't beat ' em , join ' em ! :P 
misses her family . It's been too long since we were ( almost all ) together like last week . It made me realize how much I want them all around . 
could see herself as a < PROPFIRST > ...

totaled 406 photos taken in Puerto < PROPMALE > . :) 
is drinking OJ and thinkin ' ' bout MJ's career . So many funkay songs ...

99 notifications in my inbox ... 99 notifications ... take one down ... pass it around ... 98 notifications in my inbox ! 
Freedom is not free . Thank you to our military !!! Whoop Whoop ! 
[ Drebin searches a drawer ] Frank : \Bingo ! \ " [ pulls out a bingo card ] " 
doesn't really like chocolate covered cherries . Therefore , it surprises me that I like < PROPFEMALE > pie filling over chocolate ice cream ... 
wishes she had cable and is wondering how goes it in the HR Derby . 
just made her necessary purchase for HT Camp : Pixie Sticks ! Jesus , here I come !!! :P 
Our God is \Mighty to Save\ " . Remember that . " 
I Wish You Would Step Back From That Ledge , My Friend ... :) 
really burned her finger making caramel corn . However , now she is eating away the pain . It was so worth it ... 
Heads up to all Cedar students . I went into school the other day and < PROPFEMALE > told me to spread the word . You should be checking Sycamore for any schedule conflicts or updates . Mr Bengston will post them on there . Tell other Cedar kids you know . ( Sorry

Time is an illusion . Lunchtime , doubly so .

Would I be out of line if I said , \I Miss You . \"?" 
now knows how to play Blackjack . Watch out Vegas ! ;)

Is taking a few days ' hiatus from Facebook . See y'all later . 
Is youtube-ing random songs . Suggestions ? 
is blessed and glad she's finally realized it . 
is in a goofy mood . Beware . 
??? 
is avoiding looking through college brochures and making choices about her future . Why is it this difficult ? She could totally simplify it in 4 easy steps . 1)College hears of < PROPFEMALE > and on the spot offers her a full-ride scholarship . 2) < PROPFEMALE > hems and haws a bit . 3) < PROPFEMALE > accepts . 4) < PROPFEMALE > goes . 
I say don't you know . You say you don't know . I say ... take me out . 
just danced and sang in the rain ... and then got asked what she was doing . Apparently my < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > skillz are a little < PROPMALE > . :) 
really questions where I inherited my ( not overwhelming , but still substantial , considering ... ) height from . It's not like my Dad is that tall , but Mom , well , let's just say that if I get in my car after she's driven it , I need to readjust the seat so my knees aren't at 10 & 2 . 
So Target Field has grass now ... Can you say BASEBALL !?!?! 
is really glad she learned how to properly cough today . Thank goodness for instructional videos ! :) 
is off tomorrow to exotic Tea , SD for the refreshment ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , PUN ! ) of rest , relaxation , and babysitting two little boys . I'm not sure if those last three things will work out well together ... :) 
has decided not to give in to Senioritis without a fight . I'm in one of my difficult moods ... :) Oh , and I'm happy . 
Anyone perfect must be lying . Anything easy has its cost . Anyone plain can be lovely . Anyone loved can be lost . What if I lost my direction ? What if I lost sense of time ? What if I nursed this infection ? Maybe the worst is behind ... 
is short on the profound ... but at least I know how to fix a comma splice . :) 
is pissed off ... and doesn't know why ... uh oh . 
thinks it's about time to get out of the grump ... I think I may be ready for some FOOTBALL !!!! 
wonders how much time of her lifetime she has wasted thus-far waiting for this computer to load . Wait , I don't want to know ... 
is in Iowa again . It's the hot-spot for my vacations this year . :P 
is watching SNL with < PROPFEMALE > Hathaway . I wonder if I should call < PROPFIRST > and tell him ... nah , too much effort ... :P 
Here comes the bride ... 
is . 
loves utilizing subtle facetiousness ... or not so subtle works too . :) 
... perhaps that 2 hour nap wasn't the best idea ... 
\Penny Lane\ " ... darn Beatles songs ! " 
QUeSTiOnS of sCIeNce , SciEnCE & pRoGreSS , CoULd nOt SpEAk as loUd as mY <3 . 
Questions of science , science & progress , could not speak as loud as my heart ( Happy < PROPMALE > ? Every party has a pooper , that's why we invited you ! ) . 
is in a wistful mood . Too bad Swayze's gone too ... so young . :( 
is going to explode into being someday . Sounds like paradise , right ? :) 
is happy . 
is going to have to watch \Anchorman\ " for some inspiration ... " 
is all set to find Nemo tomorrow . :) 
Ok . So I was thinking and you know the big debate over whether zebras are white with black stripes or black with white stripes ? Well , I think I figured it out . See , I hypothesize that they are some obscure color , i.e. purple or orange , with black white stripes that fit like puzzle pieces over the top . Oh my gosh , am I a genius or what ?!?!? 
OK . More food for thought . In todays Bible reading it said if your hand causes you to sin , cut it off , if your eye causes you to sin , pluck it out , etc . So what if your heart or brain cause you to sin ? Now that is a moral dilemma . :) 
Well , what am I thinking of ? Pencils , pens , zebras , minds in gutters , Pepsi , Silvershoes , sucker punches , fat deposits , Facebook quotes , and putting the elderly to sleep ... Yep . I would say it was an average day . :) 
OK . So there's a side bar with an ad to win a year's supply of American Eagle jeans . Um , couldn't you technically win just one pair then ? I wonder how many jeans are a \year's supply \"?" 
is determined to rise above mediocrity , or at least have a few more good laughs today . :) 
Thinks the Twins still have a < PROPMALE > and that this year , they won't blow it . 
with < PROPFEMALE>'s help , I realized today I was dressed like Mr. Rogers . Gosh , I am stylin'! 
GO TWINS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (& GO WHITE SOX !!! :P ) 
Livin ' it up in the Hotel Minnesota , yet again . :) 
Twins win !!!!!! ( Jumping up & down ) TWINS WIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Is hoping for the Twins , cooking chicken for dinner , and thinking sloth is WAY too tempting . 
Sometimes it hurts being a Twins fan . :'( 
So I learned the other day that it's really a bad situation to have the hiccups when working at the library . I could either a . ) suffocate myself , or b . ) embarrass myself . :) 
18 1/3 . :) 
Oh , classify this ! :) 
Noddin ' my head like yeah . Swinging my hips like YAMOY ! :P 
Is in one of her creative moods . Uh oh , Spaghetti-O !

Has another nephew on the way ! Watch out MLB ! :P 
Is constantly flying by the seat of her pants lately . I wish I could be more schedule & self-aware sometimes ( not so flighty ! ) ... 
is moving forward , starting with college applications ( deep breath -- JUMP -- freefall ) . 
Loves sitting three to a seat with JeWort & JeWieb . <3 
despises Hitchcock's work sometimes . I see a oddly large number of birds on a nice-ish day and immediately , I turn paranoid . 
has signs of another mouse residing in her car . This means WAR ! 
\You're naked ... under all your cloootthhhesss . \ " -JeWieb LOL ! " 
It's funny the motives people have sometimes : benefiting others , benefiting themselves , revenge ... btw , Go Phillies ! 
Go Cedar ! 
thinks the idea that libraries are quiet was obviously concocted by someone that never worked in one . 
Happy Hall ' , y'all! 
thinks computers hate her . Everytime she hits a key her iTunes skips and the printer won't print anything because the yellow cartridge is empty ! AHHHHHHHH ! Well , at least the feeling is mutual ... 
outsmarted her computer . Bwahaha ( and is now paranoid it will get revenge on her for this status) ! 
Don't you hate the \just one of those days\ " days ? Ugh ... This is what getting up early and staying up late does to me . :( " 
And since Halloween is over , Christmas starts ? I don't think so ! 
Yum ... fresh-baked apple muffins . :) I loves me some of that . 
is in a < PROPFIRST > Sinatra , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , Nat < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Como and the classics kind of mood ... \At Long Last Love\ " \ " Return to Me\ " \ " L-O-V-E\ " \ " It's A Good Day\ " ( contented sigh ) " 
has a headful of curlers . This had better work . 
Dress with sequins . Check . Nylons . Check . Spandex . Check . Necklace . Check . Makeup overly done ( and glitterized ) . Check . Hair curled with < PROPFIRST > pins . Check Check . Shoes . Yeah right ! :)

If anyone wants to come , Cedar's Community One Act Night is on Dec . 1st , a Tuesday . 
We're going to State ? We're going to State . ( jumping up and down ) WE'RE GOING TO STATE !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
So much to do . So little time ( and even less motivation ) ... 
LA La La la la la la la LA means , I love you ! 
realizes now that she has been getting into a really bad habit of letting things seem more difficult than they really are . 
\The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about . \"" 
Hell hath no fury like a woman cheated by her English teacher ... Hurumph . 
Awkward Turkey ! \Bawaraaah ! \ " :P Happy Day of Thanks & Giving . :) " 
Missing someone isn't about how long it's been since you've seen them last or the amount of time since you've talked . It's about that very moment when you're doing something , and you wish that they were right there with you . 
The moment I previously talked about is now . 
Community Performance for One Act : Tomorrow Night @ Holy < PROPFEMALE>'s Gym @ 7:30 pm . District One Act : The Day After Tomorrow @ 9:45 am @ Wisner-Pilger . Be there . 
District One Act : Wed . @ 9:45 am @ Wisner-Pilger . Be there . 
is more than psyched to be able to stay home , warm up inside with a bowl of Campbell's chicken noodle , and drink the broth THEN eat the noodles & chicken . :) 
Isn't it amazing how music can affect mood . I need some happier music ... 
is hopeful . 
So much I should have accomplished today and so much I didn't . Ah , gotta love Sundays . :)

Feels about half a year older than usual today .

Really , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ? Why ?!?! 
Baby , it's cold outside ! 
< PROPMALE > is officially my favorite brother due to his recent bestowal of an iPod Classic . :) < PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!! 
Toy Story 3 is a cinematic masterpiece . Now I need to go dry off my soggy face ... 
Have a wonderful & blessed 2011 . :) 
is falling in love with < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > all over again . <3 
is joyful . 
Blue polka dots with teal centers and white squares . 
A lot is on my mind . I'm glad you care , Facebook . :) 
What is the opposite of two ? A lonely me , a lonely you . 
Longest week of my life . 
Is about ready to go save the babies ... sort of . I just have to pack and do homework ... well , maybe just pack . :) 
Back from D.C. finally . < PROPFEMALE > the babies ! Oh , and btw , I love my sisters more than words can say . :) If you have a sister who is your best friend , has shared life's precious blessings with you and has also been there for you through thick and thin copy and paste this last part to your status . The world would not be the same without our sisters ! ? Don't know what I would do without my sisters ..... 
I am ridiculous . 
And I'm still standing here and you're < PROPMALE > away . 
What celeb do I most look like for this Doppleganger thing ? Opinions please . 
Really ? No celeb look-a-likes for me ?!?! C'mon people , please ( insert pouting smiley here ) . 
Time to go test out the iPod , methinks . :) 
Is itching to go home and celebrate Groundhog's Day properly with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > .

Another new Facebook . I think I actually like it better though . Shocking .

Oh , the sweet symphonic sound that is < PROPFIRST > Cooke . What memories ... :) 
has spent 90% of the last 3 hours blowing her nose . Ow . 
adores testing the limits of happiness and love and working to make them expand . :) 
would rather be an optimist and a fool than a pessimist and right . 
Lord , please keep me from insanity . However , if that is not Your will , please at least let me be happily insane . 
Lunch was super-fun today ... got any other ideas about how to mess up in the middle of a Speech and have fun with it ? We thought acting randomly schizophrenic and then going right back into the speech would be the most fun ... :) 
sees a little silhouette-o of a man ... 
So much to say and so little space . 
is so proud of our Speech team . :) 
< PROPMALE > . Here we come ! 
38 . 
What remains of the day remains to be seen by the T.V. that we never turn on ... 
? ? 1/2 of me is all about apathy and the other 1/2 just doesn't care . ? ? 
isn't sure . 
is almost all ready for Kearney . :) 
is glad to know that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Loecker , < PROPFEMALE > Wiebelhaus , < PROPFEMALE > Lammers , and especially < PROPFEMALE > Wortmann never really listen to her . :P 
thanks , everyone for all the \Good Luck\ " s for State Speech . I'm the luckiest girl in the world . ;) " 
Lately the weather has been so bipolar and , consequently , so have I . 
is happy Mauer said his vows ... to the Twins . ;) 
is sad . 
is going to play some Scrabble . It's been too long ... 
would officially like to welcome little < PROPMALE > into the world . :) I can't wait to meet you ! 
Where to go ? 
UST or UNL , that is the question . Well , cast your vote . We'll see . Maybe I'll go by majority . :) 
Why can I never just feel one emotion ? OK , I know why , I'm a woman ... but still ... it'd be nice to not be hit by conflicting moods all the time ! 
cares & is worried . 
where for < PROPMALE > thou , puppy ? 
Hopes she is not literally smothered by all this college paperwork , but , if so , she hopes asphyxiation by scholarships will at least get her some $$$ through insurance . 
Dear Parents Everywhere , Please teach your children how to properly flush a toilet as part of their potty-training experience and please also encourage them to do it . With Warmest Regards , Your Librarian . 
Prayers please . 
There goes my career in balloon animal < PROPMALE > . Oh well , at least it went out with a bang . ( I apologize . )

9 . 
I can't quite seem to wrap my head around love . I think I'm gonna try wrapping my arms around it instead . <3 
Smile . It may keep you sane . No promises , though . :) 
? ? I can't fight this feeling anymore . ? ? ( 8 left , by the way ! ) 
My head hurts . :( 
is taking a deep breath for the sprint to the finish . 
Paper time [ grumble , grumble ] . 
My last day of high school is tomorrow . Oh , sorry . MY LAST DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL IS TOMORROW !!!!!!! 
I sat awhile thinking , \I'm done with high school . \ " Then I smiled . Then I thought \ " What to do with all this time on my hands ? \ " Then Mom came in and told me our plans for the next few weeks . So much for time ... :( " 
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives . 
Salutatorian Speech ( check ) . 
Graduation . Let's do this ! :) 
( smile ) 
Sometimes it's very bad to be left alone with your thoughts . 
I've just realized that though I am down to only one college to give information to now , they will continue to increasingly request more . I am currently buried under a mountain of paperwork , trying to figure out what to do next . Oh well . Recycling box , you will no longer be hungry . :) 
Thank God for my family . While sifting through the millions of facets of college info , I realized I'd be completely lost without my siblings . They're all so smart that chances are , whatever I have a question on , one or more of them can help me . It's like a gigantic information database that's much more fun than Google . :) It would stink to have a small family ! Love y'all and thanks ! <3 
If a deaf person swears , does his mom wash his hands with soap ? 
Thank you all who have served our country . God bless the U.S.A. :) 
Welcome , June . My favorite month ... :) 
Oh , the monotony . 
National Donut Day again . Hurrah . 
is going to be grilling Dad a belated Birthday dinner ( and really , < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > an Anniversary dinner ... ) of mojo-marinated steak & shrimp . I really hope I don't screw it up . :) 
? ? ... And let all who toil , Let them \ 
come to the water . And let all who are weary , Let\ 
them come to the Lord ...? ? 
College Registration . Yippee ( sarcasm ) . 
Is now cooking shish-kabobs consisting of sweet onions , pineapple , red potatoes , and navel orange slices ( covered in leftover mojo marinade ) to go with the chicken Mom cooked . I have a feeling my culinary excercise will be somewhat limited starting in the fall ... oh yeah , I'll be by hungry siblings with kitchens . :) 
is listening to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Oh , the memories . :) 
So I'm cooking lunch and Dad comes around the corner into the kitchen giving me an expectant look . \What's up ? \ " I question . \ " Did you yell ' Dinner's ready' ? \ " He asks . \ " Um ... no ... \ " \ " Oh . I dreamed it then . \ " He returns to his chair . :D " 
< PROPFIRST > made my parents and I a belated birthday suprise breakfast . We've now decided to call ourselves \The Breakfast Club . \ " <3 " 
Poor Dad . His birthday was the 4th , so he was reminded of how old he is . On my birthday 9 days later , he was reminded how old his youngest is and , therefore , how old he is . Here comes Father's Day to re-re-remind him of how old he is by pointing out his many children and , hence , gray hairs . Poor man . :) 
Anyone interested in buying a brand new iPod Touch ??? 
Anyone , $195 for a beautiful , brand-spanking-new , 8 GB iPod Touch ? That's over $15 off what you'd pay for the retail price and taxes if you were to buy it straight from Apple ... 
is clocking into work after helping with Totus Tuus and attempting to give blood . I'm looking forward to going back to Totus Tuus afterwards for a retreat . :) 
loves Jesus , yes she do ! She loves Jesus , how ' bout you ? ( I think Totus Tuus is getting to me ... :) ) 
finds herself randomly making ninja noises . I wonder why ... :) 
Facebook , Meet < PROPMALE > Book Pro . < PROPMALE > Book Pro , Meet Facebook . :) 
So . I'm on a new computer that is going to be a good < PROPMALE > in college . Later , I'm going swimming . Then I'm going to begin my love affair with Target Field . I have a family that I love and a God that loves me . What more could one ask for ? :) 
I'm a good girl , I am . Just like \My Fair Lady . \ " :) " 
Is all tear-stained and stuffed up . Darn < PROPFEMALE > Kingsbury . :) 
The thing that worries me the most is the fact that you will always ask me what I am looking so worried about ... and then I'll have to tell you . 
I feel like renting a helicopter and having someone in it film me and I turn around : ? ? \The HILLS are alive ... with the Sound of Music ... \ " ? ? It's just that gorgeous outside . :) " 
It's very had being obedient sometimes . Well , at least in a couple months I get a few more of my own choices ... I was so tempted to pull a ( quick hand movement ) \Not interested . \ " :) " 
Love hide and seek , especially when hiding involves laying out underneath the stars . :) 
I take the blame for the < PROPMALE>'s loss in the All-Star Game . It's because I didn't watch ... Oh well , there's always the next ten years or so for them to win . :) 
Had a terrific night , so much fun ... even though we were so tasty to the mosquitoes . I also discovered that grapes dipped in peanut butter make a dynamic midnight snack , especially when traveling to Minnesota later in the morning . :) 
So tomorrow is registration day for my college classes . UST is that much closer . Yay ! 
Babysitting < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . Hurry up and get home , < PROPFEMALE > , PLEASE ! :P 
Yay ! I think the baby's waking up ! :)

So the grass looks greener on the other side . So what ? Think how much they have to mow it ... 
loves a mystery . Don't you , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ? :) 
joyful ... yeah , I think that's the best way to explain it . :) Thanks , Totus Tuus . 
< PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > are here !!! :) 
currently has guacamole , orange juice , and frosting in her fridge . Can this day get any better ?!?! 
is thinking she always thought the Rockies would be a whole lot rockier than this . That < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is full of it . :) Who can guess where I am ? 
Home again , home again , jiggety jig . 
\I told my wife that a husband is like a fine wine- he gets better with age . The next day she locked me in the cellar . \ " :) " 
is excited for almuerzo en la noche !!! Ay Ay ! 
Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut that held its ground . 
So .. laughing until you are hyperventilating , listening to a crazy Canadian , having someone sass back at you , being < PROPMALE > Norris-ed in the thigh , and freaking out every time a shooting < PROPFEMALE > decides to go streaking . Not a bad way to spend the wee small hours of the morning . :) 
wishes someone didn't trust her with quite so many secrets to hold in for so long ... 
Yay ! I am now * ahem * allowed to announce that I am an aunt , again . Welcome , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Weier-Rauscher ! Congrats < PROPFEMALE > Weier & < PROPMALE > M . Rauscher ! 
Today was great . :) 
There are sometimes when you just have to laugh , and sometimes it's at yourself . What a ditzy day and a fun night . :) 
is loving the beautiful weather outside . :) Thunderstorms are awesome ! 
Loves VOTA . LOVES them . :) 
After preliminary shopping rounds , I'm thinking I'll be spending upwards of $550 on books this first semester alone . So , if you're doing any early Christmas shopping for me , please buy me some money . Otherwise the < PROPFEMALE > Weier Charitable College Donation fund is always open to gifts ... :) 
I really only have four days left living here ... I'll be gone for a week to St. < PROPFIRST > before I come back home to finally pack up and move ... so I ONLY HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT HERE ! I can't believe it . Kinda sad , really exciting , and Minnesota-bound . :) 
feels like she just sold her soul to the UST Bookstore . 
< PROPFEMALE > is my new BFF . 
is reading material of her choice . I hope I'll still have time for this in a couple weeks . 
My poor fingers ! Mom has me working in a sewing sweatshop to prep me for doing my tenth birthday quilt ... which MAY be finished by the time I'm twenty , with some luck . :) 
Zucchini bread [ X ] , Zucchini cake [ X ] , M&M cookies ( for the grown man who goes crazy when he sees one ... and , I am favorite his favorite sister-in-law as a result ! ) [ X ] , Slave labor [ XX ] . Yep . Normal day in the life of visiting relatives . :) 
So , deep confession for a dog lover ... I can see why you would love a cat . Particularly if her name is Amethyst . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > and I had a sleepover . And I feel old . 
I am glad I have always been a night-before paper writer and vacation-packer . It has been great training for the \pack up your room in 3 days\ " extravaganza I'm attending now . " 
Somebody's always saying goodbye . See you later , Hartington . 
Well , I've moved off to Minnesota and am now < PROPMALE>'s adoptive mother for the day . My , how responsibility grows with freedom . :) 
has really sore legs after biking 20 1/2 < PROPMALE > on a mountain bike today . I have a whole new kind of respect for any hamster that's ever been on the wheel . 
Two crazy boys bathed , read to , showered , ice creamed , tooth-brushed , vitamined , watered , and in bed . One exhausted aunt . 
Never realized how much she really missed her nephews until she got to see them almost every day . There's nothing quite like snips and snails and puppy dog tails . :) 
??? Never seen you lookin ' so lovely as you did tonight . I've never seen you shine so bright . Mmm hmm uh hmm hmmm . ??? Sigh ... :) 
Don't you hate when something is beeping and you don't know what it is ? You search under the couches , in the toy bins , under couch cushions , in between the fridge and the wall . And don't you hate it even more when it turns out to be the cell phone in your right pants pocket ? 
Hello world from the 6th floor of Dowling . :) 
Classes start in an hour , 35 . Nervousness starts in 3 ... 2 ... 1 . 
is babysitting my boys . They are so cute . I'm glad that they're still at the stage where blowing kisses is fun . I'm hoping that will continue into their teenage years , at least . :) 
Yo estudio Espanol . Soy muy frazzled . 
Thank you , God , for all these amazing women You've put in my life ! :) 
So we had our first football game and first victory today ( Go Tommies ! ) . My favorite part ? The game itself ? No . The win ? No . My favorite part was the bald eagle that circled over the field on its own whim . God Bless the U.S.A. 
left her lungs in Church . Well , I guess if you're gonna be in Liturgical Choir , that's the way to do it ! :) 
can't seem to stop smiling . God is better than botox ! :P 
is glad she remembers the most useful Spanish phrase for when she gets out of Espanol : \Tengo < PROPFEMALE > dolor en mi cabeza . \"" 
is going to babysit < PROPMALE > this afternoon . I can feel his excitement about seeing his favorite aunt ( Me , < PROPFEMALE > . ME ! ) radiating all the way over to campus . ;) 
Deep breath . I can handle this ( with Help ) . :) 
loves that she has family to hook up her cable , VCR , and DVD for her . :) 
What an awesome day . :) Shopping at MOA ( and getting some REALLY cute stuff- Thanks , < PROPFEMALE >!) , eating a Hawaiian Luau Jucy < PROPFEMALE > at the Blue Door Pub , having a game night with my floormates and some < PROPFEMALE > guys , and going to Live Karaoke at Scooters . Oh . My . Goodness . 
is going to study ( blech ) and then I'm going to the Last < PROPMALE > Mass at SJV at 9pm . Who else is gonna be there ? You should come . Yes . You . Then we can play Ninja afterwards ... :) 
If you don't have frosting coated animal crackers with little sprinkles on them you NEED to get some . 
Yay ! 
is living life dangerously and eating yogurt with a FORK , OVER her brand new sweater . O , how college has made me a wild-child ! 
is being distracted by the weather . I . Love . Rain . 
is thinking of how crazy \former Lisa\ " would have thought me to be . A . ) I'm cleaning my room . Voluntarily . B . ) I get up at 5:45 am every morning . Voluntarily . C . ) I'm drinking unthinkable amounts of OJ from the cafeteria . ( OK ... she would have approved of that one ) . More than voluntarily . " 
had a very interesting night . It involved police and a whole lot of Dr. Pepper . :) 
Yo hablo Espanol muy muy bueno con < PROPFEMALE > cerveza en la parte superior ! Ay ay ay ! ARRRRIBA ! 
is laughing at herself . I'm such a ditz sometimes ... 
is people-watching in the cafeteria . I'm sitting by \awkward first date in college caf because we can't afford anywhere else\ " couple and \ " laugh so hard noodles may just come out my nose\ " girl . Good times . Good times ... " 
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts ... didda-ly , didda-ly . Here they are a standing in a row , Row , ROw , ROW . Yes . I am avoiding homework . Your point ? 
Don't you love being rescued ? I've been having the most devastating little moments : dropping my toothbrush on the bathroom floor , stepping in a mudhole with my favorite sneakers , missing an appointment . Then my everyday heroes come in and make it all better : a new toothbrush , an open door and a smile , and compassion . Remember , it's the small acts of it that show how big love really is . 
LOVES hearing Minnesotans practice Spanish . It's like there's an accent over every O . :) 
Absolutely adores Minnesota . I really do . The sky is the most perfect blue I've seen in awhile , the leaves are changing , I have a fresh OJ smoothie in my hand , I'm rocking the sweats , and I'm chillaxin ' with the Mother of Victory behind the Chapel . Does life get much better than this ? ( Of course , I'll look back on this status in February and cry ... :)) 
While I'm waiting ... 
loves how precious she feels here . I feel like I have worth just walking these grounds and am discovering big and small ways in which I matter , but not because of anything I've done . It's because I am a family member . Thanks , St. < PROPFIRST > . \ 
P . S . - Win vs . the Johnnies today , OK ? :) 
had a :) kind of day . 
is officially playing house . She's got a baby asleep in his bedroom , a < PROPFEMALE > begging me to be fed/petted ( neither of which I can do ) , a sink full of dishes , a pot of chili simmering on the stove , a load of laundry going , and a list of things to do a mile long . Welcome , adulthood . :/ 
O , what a beautiful morning . O , what a beautiful day ! Mass was lovely , the weather was so amazingly crisp and fall-y , God has gifted me with some of the most unique and beautiful women I've yet had the privilege to know , and I got to go to a < PROPMALE > Maher , Addison Road , and Tenth Ave . North concert . So much to be thankful for . :) 
You would think I'd learn to NOT put my homework off until Sunday night , which spills over onto Monday , which cascades down on Tuesday , and smothers Wednesday , leading to asphyxiation on Thursday , but sweet relief comes on Friday ... and a homework-less weekend . :) It's a vicious cycle . 
fought it out with God today . God won . Thank goodness ! 
misplaced her cell phone temporarily . It'll show up as St. < PROPFIRST>'s got it covered , but in the meantime , I'm okay and don't not love you if I'm not responding to texts/calls . Please try and email me instead until I find it ... 
Mission accomplished . Cell located . Thanks for all the concern & help in finding it , all ! Feel free to call and text me like crazy so I feel loved . St. < PROPFIRST > ( nudge , nudge ) , I owe you one , < PROPMALE > . ;) 
Twins . You CAN do it . Seriously . I'm not joking around here . I'm not messing with you and I'm not going to beat around the bush . You are the better team . BELIEVE it and KICK SOME YANKEE TUSH !!!! AHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!! 
loves her Frisbee Sisters and wishes she hadn't busted the Frisbee . :D 
The 2K Fun Run surprisingly lived up to its name . By the way , I have the cutest nephews in the world , true story . :) 
Twins , I've decided something . I still love you . Here's to next year . :) 
isn't even stressed anymore . OK , not really anyways . :) 
... 
Reason # 5,100,031 why college rocks : Today's lunch and dinner menus consist of < PROPMALE > crackers , smeared with a smattering of < PROPFEMALE > ( Pooh would approve ) , healthy animal cookies , ( actually healthy ) raisins , and a generous amount of gummy bears , washed down by at least 3 cups of hot chocolate . Ah , the life . :) 
does not know what is going on with her joints today . For some reason I sound like a walking advertisement for Rice Krispies . 
OK , < PROPFIRST > . Speak to my heart ... in a timely manner . :) 
is anticipating her first authentic swing dancing experience tomorrow night . This could go horribly wrong . Then again , perhaps it will evolve into my career . Who knows ? :) 
Best . Night . Ever . ( Sigh ... ) 
I used to think the women on my floor were crazy . Now I KNOW . :) Who knew you could have this much fun ? 
Had the best day ... because of a copy machine . Does that make me a nerd ? :) 
Mid terms ... yeah ... I should probably be studying for those ... ooo ! < PROPFEMALE > Corn ! 
is effortlessly gonna crank out her 800- 1,000 word essay and then go have some Fall Fun ... Tomorrow will bring the Homecoming game & dance ... and Sunday will bring Mass and movie night . And I'll fit studying in between . How's that for time management ?!?! 
< PROPFEMALE > Cink , < PROPFEMALE > Shaffer , Brigetta Roden , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > . That was the BEST movie night ever . I haven't laughed that hard in awhile ... Let's do that again ! :) 
Just ran . 8 < PROPMALE > in jeans . Oh , yes . :) 
' s brain is settling back into the middle of her skull after a whirlwind of swing dancing . Oh my goodness , I love it ! 
? ? Guide me safely through the night so I may see the sun tomorrow when the new day has begun . Oh , lead me on , in times of pain , lead me on . And may my heart be always warmed with thoughts of You . ? ? 
In the spirit of assimilating with the Northern culture of these here parts , I'm going to pledge my undying allegiance to either the Vikings or Packers for next year's match-up and I will cheer like crazy for whichever team gets the most votes . So , who do you think I should cheer for ? And ... GO ! 
Mid-terms and I'm still alive ( knock on wood) !!! :) 
Vikings or Packers ? The voting continues ( and < PROPMALE > Miller , you've already voted :) ) ... 
Um ... so looking out the good ol ' 6th floor window this morning , I'm really hoping there are a whole lotta ' feisty squirrels fighting in the bushes and that , consequently , they're throwing white confetti ( quite possible ) , because there's no way it could be this < PROPFEMALE > and SNOWY !!! Darn ! It better be snowing in NE too ... :) 
Thank you , God , for a warm bed in which to sleep and your love to wake up to . :) 
Well , Happy Halloween tomorrow , all and have a blessed Thanksgiving too ! I'm off Facebook in celebration of \No Facebook November . \ " Have a great month and call me/ text me/email me if you want/need to reach me . :) " 
Checking in . After 1 month and 2 days , I'm back . :) 
Thank you to all who made my wall so colorful this November . It means a lot to me that you'll willing to spam , tease , and outright lie about me all in the name of love ( P . S . - I did NOT vote Francona for Manager of the Year , do not love pumpkin pie , root beer , Red Vines , or coconut in any form , I don't think I have \man hands\ " and I am officially crushed that I missed a whole month of < PROPFIRST > Depp movie marathons ) . " 
Life is good . I realize it will continue beyond finals ( regardless of how well I do ) , I'm surrounded by amazing people , I have Christmas music playing , I get to perform onstage on Sunday ( it's been far too long ) and every time I go outside I can find someone worth pelting mercilessly with snowballs . I am so blessed . :) 
I wonder if brains come with expiration dates . If so , I think mine is past ... 
Christmas Concert fun begins in approximately 8 hours . Dear Jesus , help me remember the words . :) 
Christmas Concert = done . < PROPFEMALE > = tired , but happy . :) 
is really perky considering she is looming at death's door ( that's how I refer to finals now ) . OK , so mayhaps a bit dramatic , but really it all makes Christmas that much more exciting- life beyond finals ? I'd say yes to that . 
My floor is ABSOLUTELY too much fun ! Thank you ladies , for BEing yourselves . :) 
There's nothing quite like getting up at 5am in order to ( successfully ! ) conquer a paper . 
Is so tired . This whole finishing my classes with parties and food thing is just sapping all my energy . I'm sure I'll be bright and perky next week once the tests roll around . Not ( I had you fooled for a minute there , admit it ) . 
Times to watch the UST Christmas Concert on MN's PBS channels :\ 
TPT 2- December 15th : 7:00 pm , December 16th : 1:00 am , December 24th : 9:00 pm , December 25th : 3:00 am , 9:00 am\ 
TPT MN- December 21st : 8:00 pm , December 22nd : 2:00 am , 8:00 am , 2:00 pm 
Isn't it interesting how unimportant homework seems when one is a student ... but it's really what one should be doing when one is instead talking to others , having tickle fights , discussing proper apparel , getting massages , listening to Christmas carols , watching classic movies , playing in the snow , or on Facebook ? Me oh my , college is fantastic . :) 
Dance tonight . Whoop Whoop ! My shopping cart , sprinkler system , can opener , lawn mower and sea anenome are all good to go ! 
Too much fun . Last night was amazing . The Catholic Women's Floor has moves I've most definitely never seen anywhere before . :P This morning was awesome . SNOW ! Lord of the Rings : Two Towers and then the most intense workout ever ( Ran 2 , Biked 2 , excercise ball , step aerobics , dancing ) and had bacon to make up for it . Now , who would really spoil all of that with studying ? 
I've seen some beautiful things today- people going down in glorious snow-tackles on the quad , some wild and crazy elf hairdos , telephone pictionary interpretations of < PROPMALE > at its finest , many smiles , and no homework . Thank you , Jesus . :) 
Finals start tomorrow . Oh my . 
is content in the midst of finals . Yay ! 
Catholic Studies paper . Check . Spanish final . Check . Theology final . Check . Journalism final . Meh . 
Ok . Finals = done . And what a lovely day and night . < PROPMALE > Lockwood was amazing , as usual , I had the most incredible butter-dunked bread ( that doesn't nearly make it sound as good as it should ) and mint brownies , my books are sold back , my friends are awesome , many birthdays were to be had , I get to see family tomorrow , and Jesus is coming ! Yay ! So blessed . 
The angel's on the tree and the little boys are running around flailing their arms . One would think it was already Christmas ... :) 
is watching the Christmas concert . :) 
ate a 30\ pizza today ( with help ) . I just thought that might be notable . " 
is finally on \The Lord of the Rings : Return of the King\ " film . Only 3 hours and 20 minutes left ... :) " 
is looking forward to making almond bark pretzels WITHOUT having to slap hands away , rebuke family members , cry that almost all are gone as soon as I make them , and despair of having so large a family . It'll basically be done in secret this year . ;) 
I'm glad we got more snow yesterday . I was beginning to miss it . 
Almond bark pretzel/ Christmas movie marathon time . :) 
While holding my four-year-old nephew at the shopping mall this morning , I noted how hefty he was getting : \You've gotta stop growing ! Pretty soon I won't be able to < PROPFEMALE > you anymore ! \ " He replied : \ " I've gotta keep growing so then I can < PROPFEMALE > you ! \ " Ok . I can live with that . :) " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Yay Christmas ! Jesus and only two instances of coal ... things are looking up . :) 
is thinking up some New Year's resolutions . Any suggestions ? 
is so upset that Fox isn't accepting her promo code ( that it SHOULD be accepting ) for a free poster with \Walk the Line\ " on it . :( " 
swears 6-year-olds can take the longest showers ever for not having that much hair to wash , etc . This reminds me of the olden days with one bathroom and more ( many more ) than one kid in the house . 
Got to watch football with her Daddy tonight , just like old times ... well , almost . The Vikings actually won this time . <3 
just got 16 CDs and 4 DVDs that she REALLY wanted from 1/2 Price Books for $25 . Thanks , < PROPFIRST > N < PROPFEMALE > Weier ! Best part : One CD is < PROPFEMALE > Jones ( happy swoon) ! 
is never forgetting her cell phone again ... especially since her brother < PROPFIRST > is now texting who knows what with it . If you get any text from me in the next 24 hours or so , I wouldn't necessarily believe it . 
It sounds like I'll be spending New Year's < PROPFEMALE > watching movies/shows that contain New Year's scenes in them ( Sleepless in Seattle , Friends : New Year's episodes , ... Um ... ) . Can anyone think of more ? 
is barely in the door before < PROPFIRST > Weier has me doing dishes . Oh well , at least he refers to me as an \indentured servant\ " instead of \ " slave . \ " Between him and < PROPFEMALE > Fristad I don't know how much strength I'll have left come school . " 
has spent her morning learning about ordination ceremonies for priests since she's trying to reorganize the photo database ( complete with captions ) at work . So beautiful ! It makes me happy for all my friends who have been ordained and excited for all those who will be . :) 
would like to send out a big ' ol Congrats ! to < PROPMALE > Blyleven . ' Bout time ! :) ( I would like this status circled ... ) 
I wanna drive the Zamboni . I wanna drive the Zamboni-eeeeeeeeee ! Yes I do . 
is looking forward to a day of family , boardgames , and \Despicable Me . \"" 
is back to UST tomorrow for a few days of work and sleepovers . :) 
Workout time . 3 miles ... at least . :) 
Happy 1/11/11 ! The date makes me wish I was playing Yahtzee . ;) 
Since maybe the third grade I have abhorred school . Detested it . Avoided it . I clung to summer and skirted winter . Swimsuit . Yes . Snowsuit . No . As crazy as it sounds , I love winter now . Thank you , MN . :) And school , well love that too ! I'm looking forward to it starting up again . 
Perhaps running a cumulative seven < PROPMALE > in the last two days was a mistake . It seems all my leg muscles are impressively forming a labor union and are now on strike . Well , there's no way they're taking the ( wo)man down ! 
mostly got over her sad memories of Red Lobster ( At the tank where people can pick the live lobster they want to eat , I witnessed two lobsters , obviously in love and holding claws , separated when someone picked one of them . Traumatic . ) by eating their Cheddar Bay Biscuits today . Yum . 
is playing with Legos . Yay ! 
To my nephew , AJ : \Hey 
Oh , ( < PROPMALE > Firth ) Mr. < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
is really happy this morning at almost one . We'll see how she feels at seven . 
K-Love is a lovely radio station . :) 
is glad Minnesota decided to give her such a warm ( Ha ! ) welcome this year . 
OK . So I'm walking from work all the way across campus and it's a usual Minnesota day . < PROPFEMALE > . Balmy . Pretty well tropical . Fine and dandy . And then my coat freezes . My coat . And it WASN'T EVEN WET ! AHHHHH ! 
Everything rides on hope now . Everything rides on faith somehow . When the world has broken me down . Your love sets me free . 
Swing dancing = Huge success . Getting back ... not so much , but so much fun . :) 
Can I just say one more time how much I love St. < PROPFIRST > , how glad I am I came here , and thankful that this is the path I'm on right here , right now ? My shameless plug for the day , seniors & juniors in HS- visit here . Visit now . Get a tour from < PROPFEMALE > Cink . You'll love it too . 
is figuring out what to pack for lunch tomorrow . She'll probably have some chicken noodle soup . It'll be great for the soul , but her body will probably still be hungry .... Gummy bears ! The solution to everything ( esp . when you have , well HAD , 6 lbs . of them ) . 
Tomorrow I get to sleep in . Maybe even until 9 . I'm so blessed . :) 
\My goal is to be the person that my dog thinks I am . \ " So true . :) " 
Baby asleep . Check . Two boys in bed . Check . Two boys asleep . Questionable . One aunt ready to sleep . Undoubtable . 
Isn't it funny how life turns the table on us sometimes ? For instance , when I knew I wouldn't have to cut grass when I moved to UST , I was ecstatic . Now , I have freshly cut grass IN MY ROOM , willingly . If it wasn't from Target Field , it would so be outta here . ;) 
Ugh . There's nothing quite like the flu to make one appreciate normal life . :) 
Classes tomorrow . Not quite sure how I feel about that ... 
Whoa . I think I'm going to hire a pack mule for my loaded MWF classes and maybe a shetland pony for my TR classes . I've always wanted a shetland pony ... 
I never really realize how much I miss singing with a choir until I'm right in the middle of it . And I never realize how much time it has been since the last time until I get to the glorious high ' A ' , and my voice cracks like a teenage boy's . Yep . Back to work ... 
In the morning show me Your love , for I put my trust in You . 
Math time . Yep . It really is . No excuses . No surfing the Internet . No eating gummy bears . No changing my Facebook status to avoid it . This is it . 
So . Blessed . :) 
Math this afternoon = :( . Swing dancing tonight = :) :D < Woo HOO ! ) 
Is it possible for swing dancing to keep getting better and better ?!?! Love it ! 
And the coin toss : Heads- cheer for the Packers . Tails- cheer for the Steelers . And the flip ... ( suspense ) ... well look at that . Guess I'm green & gold tonight . :) 
And . Classes resume . 
Best unexpected line of Mass today- Archbishop Nienstedt : \I got to see the Super Bowl last night with some of you . I even got to see the halftime show . I'm not quite sure I'd classify that as entertainment ... \ " Haha ! " 
So . I just discovered Mumford and Sons . Oh . My . Goodness . :) Oh yeah ... Bedtime ! 
Catholic Studies is pretty much the best thing since consecrated bread . 
is going to be a maid of honor . :) 
Just saw Fr . < PROPFIRST > Hoesing tonight . He is so amazing ! I went to the prospective seminarian Mass , so I suppose I was asking for it , but other than the organist , I was THE ONLY WOMAN in there . I found the first reading ( Genesis : creation of woman ) to be quite fitting . After God took out the rib and made a female , I kinda wanted to jump up and yell , \BAM ! That's me ! \ " :D " 
misplaced her cell phone , but don't worry . I still may or may not love you/ answer your calls . It's all good ... 
thinks it is BEAUTIFUL out ! 
Lovely day . Lovely . :) I walked around in a sweatshirt and wasn't even ( that ) cold ! I'm totally Minnesotan ... ;) 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! <3 
Um . That practice test was a little easier then the real thing ... 
God is so good . :) 
is jamming out to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . How do I put this exactly ?... YAY ! 
is proud of < PROPFEMALE > Cink for finding the eyeball in her pocket this morning and of < PROPFEMALE > Siegler for putting it there . :) 
is pretty much the best rapper evah . 
Oh , deceiving sunshine . One would think it was warm outside ... one would think ! 
Swimming & MOA . :) 
\Out of my mind . Back in five minutes . \ " \ 
Noise complaints . Nope . I did not just hear \thump thump thump THUD\ " down our hallway . Uh uh . " 
I would like to point out that I called this snow day since the beginning of the year ... :) 
Snow day = extra 18 or so hours of life in which to do whatever one wants . Methinks this ought-a be good ... 
Well , I recognize that I don't know what I don't know . Happy , Socrates ? 
I can do this . Yep . Uh huh . Right on . Righteous . 2+2 = 4 . The probability of me getting anything more complicated than that right = Well , let's just say it's not likely ... but it's possible . :) 
I love Catholic Studies . < PROPMALE > Cassino was ... so fantastic . :) 
Where You go I'll go . Where You stay I'll stay . When You move , I'll move . I will follow ... 
Here's to nights with no set plans . Love it ! 
Oh , homework . If only you would research yourself and solve your own problems . 
Oh no . Why are you coming in like a lamb , March !?!? This only means trouble later ... ( but I'll take it- it's so nice out ! ) 
is having a \can't make up her mind on how she's feeling\ " kinda day . Too bad I forgot to wear my mood ring ... :( :) " 
What a beautiful day to be alive ! As < PROPFIRST > Brown would say , \truly blessed and duly grateful . \ " :) " 
wants to put on her dancing shoes . And dance on her math book . And then swing dance . Sounds like a plan ! :) 
Please pray . 
\So many questions without answers . Your promises remain . I can't see but I'll take my chances to hear You call my name . \ " -TAN " 
Ballet tonight , dahling , right after Davanni's . Oh , the high class life I lead . :) 
Wow . What the human body is capable of ... I didn't even know it was possible to have that many muscles ! The Aspen < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ballet was impressive , to say the least . 
blames < PROPFEMALE > Cink for the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > running around in her head . She also thanks her . * Sigh * ... < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . :) 
I'm going to be a little premature and start thanking God for the weekend now . :) 
Remember to change your clocks . We're springing ahead . :) 
What a beautiful day ! I just about died of happiness during my own personal serenadings . And I have more to look forward to tonight ... :) It is amazing what blessings are all around me . Seriously . 
Speech . Written . Party !!! Well , actually , \fiesta . \ " It's Spanish study time . :( " 
Ides of March , my foot . Today is blessed ! There is just something about returning after two classes that went surprisingly well , changing into sweats , turning on < PROPMALE > Spehar , kicking up my feet , and thanking God for it all that is SO satisfying . 
Done with mid-terms . Coasting into Spring Break ( and it actually feels like spring ! ) . :) 
Top ' o the mornin ' to you . This is the day . The day when my < PROPFEMALE > heritage , though small , takes over my entire being . When I bask in such lovely < PROPFEMALE > music as \Come on Eileen\ " and the soundtrack to Riverdance . When I < PROPMALE > a tacky green jersey and an Ireland tattoo that I got from an actual < PROPFEMALE > women and use a horrible excuse of an accent after eating me Lucky Charms . Yep . Things are lookin ' up . :) " 
is wondering if anyone else will be on campus for spring break ... 
loves nights with no plans . There is something so peaceful about having TIME ( and I'm not talking about the magazine ) . 
Sigh . What a beautiful day . 
? ? Just singin ' and dancin ' in the rain . ? ? 
Workin ' 8 to 5 , only way to make a livin ' ( < PROPFEMALE > Parton was totally off an hour) ! 
Biggest perk of being on campus with a very small population : 2 dance studios all to myself . ;) 
\Confused and foolish oft I strayed 
In the car , on the way back from Target- < PROPFEMALE > , my sister , talking to her son AJ : \AJ 
Home again , home again and hangin ' with < PROPFEMALE > Cink . Could life be better ? :) 
Needs to stop spending so much time with < PROPFEMALE > Cink and < PROPMALE > Skinner . I'm starting to make math-related jokes . I know ! 
My mom sent me two VHS's of Riverdance today . AND it just so happens I have a VHS player . So , methinks , sometime soon , we're going to have a Riverdance marathon . Who's in ?! ( P . S . - As an added perk , I may even show off my clogging skillz ) 
smiles . 
\Every field wears a bonnet\ 
AARC = good . < PROPMALE > = bad . Twins = 2011 WS Champions . Called it . ;) 
Well . All I can say is the Twins are determined to make a really impressive comeback this year ... 
Swing dancing . WHOOP WHOOP ! :) 
There is nothing quite like a good dose of humility . 
had great plans to hibernate for the rest of winter . Darn it ! 
Is it weird that when the weather is so indecisive and < PROPFEMALE > , I still like to wear my hair down and pretend I'm Storm from X-Men ? :) 
Cheetos . Need I say more ? 
Um . Did the Twins just actually beat the Yankees ? Yep . I think they did . :) 
thinks there is something seriously wrong with homework existing on days like today ( and math tests existing in general ) . 
\Desmond has his barrow in the market place . \ 
I said the words \math\ " and \ " fun\ " in the same sentence today three times . Once was to < PROPMALE > Skinner . The double take I got was so worth it . :) " 
has joined the Army and is a 2nd Lieutenant on her first day . Mom ( < PROPFEMALE > Weier ) and Dad will be so proud . :) 
Life is Beautiful . :) 
After getting smacked in the face by some wind and old leaves on the way to work , I'm beginning to feel that being Pocahontas wasn't nearly as glamorous as Disney portrayed it ... 
Sleep . O , sweet sleep . 
has something up her sleeve ( and it's not a watch , ace of spades or squirrel ) . 
it is snowing in NE . Sweet . Lucky I'm in MN . However ... that means we'll get the leftovers . :( 
Thanks to all who made yesterday perfect . I'm still a little shocked that everything ( and I mean EVERYTHING ) worked to a T . :) 
Hey , Soul Sister ... Yep . Stuck in my head . Now stuck in yours . :) 
should get angry more often . It makes me way more productive . For instance , my math problems were just not working out . I was totally annoyed , sat down and was determined to figure them out . Boom . Roasted . 
has found a new love : Ultimate Frisbee . :) 
is looking forward to her tropical Easter in Nebraska . HA , Minnesota ! 
is thinking of all the delinquents who skipped classes in order to go home early . Sigh . One more class . One more class ... 
After hearing my nephew add and subtract with ease , I've decided to give him my matrices homework for the rest of the year ... 
Roadtrip . 7 hours in a 5-seater car . A 6-year-old on my right . A four-year-old on my left . Both are boys . Both are in their question stage ( aka- \Are we there yet ? \") We'll mostly be traveling through Iowa . This is gonna be fun . :) " 
Alleluia . :) 
is wondering how many worms were injured in the making of \Singin ' in the Rain . \"" 
Today was challenging . So good . :) 
Diary log : Second day in the Army . Rainy . Feel awkward texting in pre-technology wardrobe . Ditto for using the laptop . Getting a lot of double takes . Terrified of getting lipstick on sleeve . Should I have worn this to class ? :) 
Diary log : Third day in the Army . Hair behaving very badly . Will be wearing hat most of the day- cannot let enemy see weakness . No lipstick on sleeve as of yet . Will be reporting as miracle later . Looking forward to pulling rank on inferior servicemen & women , garnering salutes like crazy ' cross campus . Not looking forward to battle with matrices , but whoopage shall be achieved . Oh , a day in the life ... 
JPII . :) 
\Do not abandon yourselves to despair . We are the Easter people and hallelujah is our song . \ " -Blessed Pope < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > II " 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Weier . 
Will you just listen to that thunderstorm ? Beautiful . :) 
feels like she's right back in Tornado Alley . And finds it highly ironic that she told < PROPFIRST > Bearth that if he didn't bring an umbrella to the Twins game , it would rain on him . Well , he forgot it . Now its raining AND it might tornado . At least we know who to blame ... 
Whoa . So this is what it's like to feel hot again ... I had forgotten . :) 
Here's to no 8 AM class ! Whoop whoop . :) 
Holy cannoli ! My stomach just made a noise that sounded exactly like a mourning dove . Now that's interesting . 
Reasons today is great : 1)Friday . 2)Last day of classes . 3)Last math and Spanish class EVER . 4)Last day of work . 5)Day 2 of Totus Tuus team novena . 6)Just realized finals are not impossible . 7)Movie night . 8)My family is awesome and helping me with end of the year stuff . 9)God made it and Jesus loves me . 10)Ingested large amount of cheese balls . 11)19th and 11/12 birthday . 14)Friday the 13th ( both GOOD things ! ) . ... 
Packing ... this is odd . 
Math . Prepare to be amortized tomorrow . Your limits are in sight . There is no point to you . You could very well be considered plane and average . Your future value is nothing , minus what will be useful for tomorrow's exam . After that , I've found a new solution : summer . Boom . ( I know , what are odds , right ? ) 
Math . Done . Spanish . Finito-ed . Philosophy ... yeah ... almost ! 
I'm done with my first year ! I've packed ( Thanks to all who helped with the collaborative effort ) and mostly moved out . Now come the goodbyes . :( 
It's funny how life can change , even though many times , we do our best make our own little ruts and to stay in them . I'm so glad that I'm blazing trails where I never expected go and running into people who I never expected to meet . Not the way I planned it , but perfected planned . Thanks , God . :) 
Going shopping ... in Iowa . ( Let the jokes begin , < PROPFIRST > Bearth ) 
It's hard to fit a summer into one medium-sized duffle bag , several books of infinite knowledge into a small backpack , and my emotions ( fear , excitement , worry , peace , love , joy , etc . ) into one me . But I've somehow accomplished it . First mini-miracle of the summer ! 
Well , it'll be awhile until I'm back on here . My laptop is going into hibernation for the next couple months .... Have a beautiful summer , all ! 
Today is the feast of Pier Giorgio Frassati AND the 4th of July ! Should be a pretty solid day . :) 
Gearing up for the home stretch . :) 
made it through the summer by the grace of God . Now off to new adventures ... a nap , maybe a hair cut , a holy hour , reading , and UST planning . Sigh ... :) 
You know it's hot in your house when you begin wishing to live next to the ham in the refrigerator . 
is hanging out with Aunt < PROPFEMALE > & Uncle < PROPMALE > . Whoop whoop ! :) 
noticed today that hair always seems prettier and more behaved when it is about to be cut off . Ha ! I didn't fall for it , hair ! 
is going back to the land of accents , lakes and mosquitoes . Ah , yes . :) 
It is GOOD to be back in the Cities . I love the little reminders : the random billboards of Twins players , the elongated ' o's , the plaid summer wear , the giant mosquitoes ( which I love to swat ) , the plethora of suburbs , and , especially , the familiar faces . :) 
After looking at the Central Division standings I realized a Twins fan must have coined this phrase : \I'd rather be an optimist and wrong then a pessimist and right . \ " Go Twins ! " 
Go to your profile . Look to the left . First 7 friends are your zombie apocalypse team . Here is mine :\

Back to the Cornhusker state . 
Tomorrow I find out what my sister's chosen bridesmaid dresses are and if I will ever need to enact a swift and sure revenge . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Weier is the best hostess ever . :) 
Back to the land of 10,000 lakes ( or , in actuality , 11842 lakes that are 10 acres or more) ! :) 
Oh , what a beautiful mornin'! 
is joyful . There's so much to look forward to in the next month , semester , year , and so on . Life is good . :) 
I can just imagine the written up coroner's report : \Lisa Weier . 20 . Cause of death : heart attack . Cause of heart attack : Large pigeon smashing into window directly in front of her . \"" 
There is something so thrilling about filling up my planner with things to do and birthdays to celebrate . Why do I have a feeling the thrill will wear off in a few weeks ( well , not because of the birthdays) ? :) 
Home sweet DOWLING !!! 
There is so much good stuff in store for this year . AHHHH ! :)

I feel very smug having swing danced the night away to return to a smoothie and , shortly , a warm bed . So blessed ... 
J.H. Newman . :) 
I don't know if it's the tiredness , the busyness or that I've been staring at pages and a screen for too long , but there is something really beautiful and rewarding about the struggle to learn ... and it's time for pixy sticks .

“The splendor of the < PROPFEMALE > and the whiteness of the < PROPFEMALE > \ 
do not < PROPMALE > the little < PROPFEMALE > of it’s scent nor the < PROPFEMALE > of its simple charm . \

Everyone who sees < PROPFEMALE > Cink today , make sure you mention how < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > II conducted a drive for < PROPMALE > bears . You should have seen her reaction when she read the headline saying just that in the Bulletin Today . :D
