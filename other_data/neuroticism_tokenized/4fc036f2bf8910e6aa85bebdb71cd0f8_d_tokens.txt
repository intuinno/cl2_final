CALC Quiz 2maro = ? 
.. we all know that ppl aint perfect . so everything man has learned is just a rationalization to explain something complicated ( religion ) . we may later find out basicly everything we know is wrong ( the world is flat ) . so for the time being it doesnt matter who is right or wrong , but standing behind what you believe in 
I like that boulder . That is a NICE boulder .

we all fear change . but without change we wouldn't exist 
sometimes you just have to sit back and relax , hoping that everything works out 
without the consequence of death , we would never learn . there would be no right or wrong to learn from . we would have endless time to do something with no motivation to get it done .

Salary Theorem\ 
The less you know , the more you make\ 
Proof :\ 
Postulate1 : Knowledge is Power\ 
Postulate2 : Time is Money\ 
As every engineer knows : Power = Work / Time\ 
And since Knowledge = Power and Time = Money\ 
It is therefore true that Knowledge = Work / Money\ 
Solving for Money , we get :\ 
Money = Work / Knowledge\ 
Thus , as Knowledge approaches zero , Money approaches infinity , regardless of the amount of Work done .
