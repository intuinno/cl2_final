LOLROFLMAOBBQ ..... twice . 
Blah ! 
not gonna lie , I miss MSU and cant wait to get back . 
is going to drink a mountain dew ........ Finally 
Drank the dew now sick . Sucks and feel like punching something . More aware and what I thought was true , like always . 
Knew I was frickin right . 
Has some freaking awesome friends . Love u guys . 
Now taking ideas for an amazing drawing . 
La 
Really need to do some drawings for < PROPMALE > . Just stumped on what to draw . Any ideas ? 
Wonders why people take anger out on those who did nothing to them . Must be the ignorance of self pity . Only way to make life any better is to get up and do something about it . 
So I'm not sure why this is happening but I seem to be dissing everyone lol . Not serious about most of it but been a smart ass past couple days . Feels good lol . 
I hate turtles lmao . 
It's the weekend 
Sunday . A day to lay down by the bay and soak up a uav < PROPFIRST > . What more can I say ? It won't be gay . It's gonna be a nice day to say hey , it's Sunday . 
Watching eurotrip . 
Click like if I have ever made you smile , then set this as your status . ;) 
Graduation and college . Can't wait . 
A lot 
Sleep :) 
Roughly 5 days

UNO ! 
Thinking that these next few hours will go by so slowly . 
I hate wal mart

Just got back from kick ass . Best movie I have seen in so long lol . 
Bored out of my mind 
Selling an xbox 360 . Anyone interested ? 
Wondering when this bad weather ( mal tiempo ) will end ( terminar) ? 
Just bought a ton of songs off iTunes . 
Weird how I get scheduled to work five minutes before school lets out . 
Does anyone else wonder why they are still awake at four in the morning ? 
Omg it's back on but for how long ? 
Random friend requests , woo ? I'm really into skillet right now . wow it's 3 in the morning . 
Going to church , I'll be there a while . See you seniors there . 
Few days left ! 
Cannot wait for July , going to NYC ! 
Graduation is just down the hill . 
Child labor laws are what's on my mind lol . 
Truth in how history repeats itself , we are freshmen yet again . 
So , they still have my diploma . They kept it just to piss me off . That , or they are completely dumb , fat , and worthless . 
July 4 , 12 , and 17 
Feel like I have school tomorrow lol . 
To work 
Wondering how summer is treating everybody ? 
Finally got some senior pics so if u want any let me know 
So .......

Woo no more hardees , ever lol . 
Goodbye xbox360 . See u again someday lol . 
Time to start the countdown . 
Spain to the finals ! 
Beware of squaids ppl 
Ooooo sunrise , almost time for bed lol .

Lol tired but it's new York . Pretty sweet so far and it can only get better . 
Two days left , what to do ?

Back from NYC , time to get ready for MSU . 
Feel like I need to party 
So I somehow get a million things to draw just spring up into my head after months of being blank , guess what , all my drawing things are in Saint < PROPFIRST > . Just my luck . These ideas are great too . 
I have an idea for the best game ever . It would create a gaming revolution . Or just make all other games look like crap . 
Can I go to bed yet ? 
So I started planning my world trip today . Looks promising . Take a little bit to save up money though .
