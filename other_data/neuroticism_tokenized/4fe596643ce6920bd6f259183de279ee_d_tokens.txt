PEACE . LOVE , CAPTAIN CRUNCH !!!! 
~ * ~ PEACE , LOVE , CAPTAIN CRUNCH !!! ~ * ~ 
but i miss screaming and shouting and kissing in the rain , its 2 am and im cursing your name , so in love that i acted insane , thats the way i loved you 
i cant help it if you look like an angel , cant help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so , come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you , cant help it if there's no one else 
cause when you're 15 and somebody tells you they love you , you're gonna believe them , and when you're 15 feeling like there's nothing to figure out . coint to 10 take it in , this is life before you know who you're gonna be at 15 
cause i dont know how it gets better than this , you take my hand and drag me head first fearless , and i dont know why , but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress fearless . 
band camp was exuasting *_* 
band camp ... 
band camp ... eh

wishes i had super powers 
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town i havent seen it in a while since she brought you down 
you say your fine i know you better then that , hey what you doing with a girl like that ? se wears high heels i wear sneakers , she's cheer captain and im on the bleachers dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find that what your looking for has been h 
all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around , i've been giving out chances everytime and all you ever do is let me down . 
you can walk away , say we dont need this , but there's something in your eyes saying , we can beat this . 
blondes dont always have all the fun
