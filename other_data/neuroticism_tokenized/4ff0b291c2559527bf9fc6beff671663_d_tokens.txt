i think i have ADHD . i swear to god .

so i decided that if someone wants to talk to me , THEY could pick up the phone and call ME instead of the other way around . i'm through with chasing people . ps . < PROPFIRST > FINALLY went to sleep yay ! no more screaming ! =] 
so i still don't have my phone , i have nothing to do for thanksgiving , my car won't start , my mother won't stop snapping at me , < PROPFIRST > won't stop crying and i have no time to take a shower . this week = worst ever .

i love how everyone in the world is sleeping right now besides < PROPFIRST > and me . and everyone else who has little kids . 
nothing to do and my internet is messed up ! ugh ! 
i love how < PROPFEMALE > is spending the whole day digging these elaborate paths around my yard while my car is still buried in snow . like cool , i guess we're walking to manahawkin . 
OMG < PROPFIRST > STAY ASLEEP ! 
i really frigging hate when people think it's okay to smoke around someone who doesn't and their infant ... and they get all offended when you ask them to please not smoke . i can't wait to smoke weed and blow it in their eight month old's face . 
whoever made talking & singing < PROPMALE > is the supreme genius of mankind . 
I really hope 2010 is going to be a lot better than 2009 . I'll take even slightly better , as long as it's not worse . 
I suck , apparently . 
Where is < PROPFEMALE > ? =[

I am so hungry thank god < PROPFEMALE > left her ramen noodles here ! 
NY wears me out so I'm sleeping for the rest of the weekend .... yeah right , like < PROPFIRST > will let me . 
Isn't this pill supposed to STOP me from being nervous all the time ? 
i wish i could write a memoir but no one would believe it . 
My life would be so lame without < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . 
I'm not even 21 yet and I'm sick of alcohol . 
Since everyone is doing it .... 1 . < PROPFEMALE > A person who is very hot and has the greatest personality ever ! In hebrew < PROPFEMALE > means < PROPFEMALE > . There for you should treat her as if she was one ! < PROPFEMALE > is also a very irresistable person . Damn ! That < PROPFEMALE > chick is so fine ! I wish that < PROPFEMALE > chick was single cause then she would be mine ! ... lol . 
< PROPFIRST > actually fell asleep so now i can actually do normal human shit , like watch TV 
Does anyone else enjoy looking at pictures of guidos on a snowy afternoon ? I do . 
Another Sunday night where everyone at my house is drinking and watching football while I stuff my face by myself =[ Who wants to join me ? [ Nikki ? ] 
Wow don't park in my driveway unless you're content with leaving your car there until June . 
< PROPFIRST > is crawling all over the house !!!!! AAUGHH ! =] 
Cause I put the chopper in your face and let it go BRRRRAAAPPPP !!! 
extreme hunger + sleep deprivation + screaming infant + lack of human contact = one very tense lady 
My internet is working ! Sweet !

i love < PROPFEMALE > . seriously , what would i do without < PROPFEMALE > ? 
i can't wait to see < PROPFEMALE > , get my hair cut , and go out with my girls ! finally a wednesday that doesn't blow ! 
i frigging hate how facebook gives you a notification when you comment someone's status and you have like 25 of them because some dope you don't even know decides to have a whole conversation with your friend and you don't even understand the convo and so you're like , wtf ? why did i just waste 30 whole seconds reading this crap ? i wish i could tell this to < PROPFEMALE > but he doesn't listen to me ... lol .

Maybe it's the everlasting mess in this house that causes me to hit the bottle . Or my husband . It's really 50/50 . lol 
I think I'm going to run away from home to wawa like I did when I was 7 . Only this time I'm not going to chicken out and come back in an hour lol . 
It's st. < PROPFEMALE>'s day , i'm wearing < PROPFIRST>'s shirt , i stole < PROPFIRST>'s phone . i'm tipsyyyyy :) 
< PROPFEMALE>'s house = paradise . when her moms isn't here , that is . and when < PROPFIRST > isn't trying to claw my eyes out lol . 
Moe thinks he can out last me in drinking < PROPFEMALE > hahahahhaha ! i'm going to watch icarly drunk and shit i wont remember but what the hell lol yayyy 
It's not possible to be addicted to weed , right ?

ghn vb v gni b kiii < from < PROPFIRST > =] 
I am now officially \mama\ " ! < PROPFIRST > just said it ! I'm about to cry ! " 
Back to New York AGAIN . Lame . But hopefully I see Justyna . 
< PROPFEMALE > is watching Avatar for the 18th time with the volume turned up so loud that it sounds like the house is being bombed , but I can't imagine why < PROPFIRST > is having trouble falling asleep . 
I love having a stepsister . I'm tuning out her constant talking while my back throbs with pain from being slammed with a basketball . 
< PROPFEMALE > 25 yeahhh ! 
The blonde part of my hair : darker blonde , dark reddish pink , or bright purple ? Note that I would like to get a job & have to go to court once a month . But I love purple =[ 
I love this April Fools day ! My hair is < PROPFEMALE > tale pink [ screw court ] , it's nice out , < PROPFIRST > and I are going for a walk , I have money to eat , and < PROPFIRST>'s coming over . Yeah ! 
text me if you want cupcakes i made like 80 
My little guy is one years old today ! I can't believe it ! Even though I felt like I've had him for 5 years already lol . 
I never remember to check my phone until the middle of the night when I can't text anyone back . So sorry guys . 
Why does everyone make such a big deal about this holiday ? This Easter , I did absolutely nothing & got screwed over . Last one , I was sitting home miserable wishing they would release my son from the hospital . The one before that I was so coked up I couldn't tell if it was Easter or Christmas , and that was the best one I've ever had . Fuck easter ! 
\I only got 4 hours of sleep last night . FML . \ " Really ? I would KILL to have 4 straight hours of sleep . I haven't slept longer than 45 minutes in about 3 weeks because my one year old suddenly acts like a newborn . So FML . lol . " 
I have the grossest blister ever . It looks like a fat , bloated New Jersey . 
definitely a park day today with the cutest baby ever 
WHY do people think it's a good idea to mess with an angry , sleep deprived , PMS-suffering girl with a headache ? Would you LIKE all your teeth to fly down your throat ? I didn't think so . =] 
Love cleaning with a busted knee ! After this I'm taking < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > and bouncing from this shitty house ! 
Why is the end of May so far away ? Nah , screw the end of May . Something needs to be done NOW before shit gets even uglier . 
Smoothie , snacks , and a book ... hopefully mommy relaxation time will be more than 20 minutes tonight . 
Ugh , talk about the week from hell . 
Ahh , all the dumb shit I had to take care of is all done ... now I can relax tonight and over the weekend . :) 
Wow , people are FUCKED UP . That's all I gotta say . 
Screw you , sinus infection . I have a life , okay ? 
Happy Earth Day ! Going to NY later , sweeettt ! 
I like pleasure spiked with pain and music is my aeroplane .... it's my aeroplane 
Hmm , what to feed < PROPFIRST > ? We have only rice at the house and I really don't feel like waging a baby jar battle at all today . 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > . Is she in NJ this week , anyone know ?? 
Food in the house ! FOOD in the HOUSE !!!! FOOD IN THE FRIGGING HOUSE !!!!! 
Why is everyone freaking out because they changed ' become a fan of ' to ' like' ? What difference does it make ? How does it affect anything else on facebook or your real life [ if you have one] ? Try worrying about something that really matters ! 
I need to get out of this house before I throttle everyone , dogs and all . 
Ugh ! Ready to jump off a bridge !!!!!! Not seriously , but it does sound like a good idea ! 
Where is a place where there is no screaming , traffic , headaches , insults and loneliness ? Does that place exist ? Oh yeah , it's called MY BED . Good night . 
I don't have internet ... I'm on Moe's computer ... but you can text me . I'll be in Jersey next week sometime . 
YAY internet & cable !!!! 
my poor kiddo =[ 
Like , why do people assume I don't eat ? Has anyone seen me eat ?? I eat like a fricken wolly mammoth just because I'm not 300lbs does not mean I can't eat 300lbs of pizza , chicken nuggets , pepsi and hamburgers lol . 
Can't wait to go back home where I can actually breathe and move around .... wish < PROPFIRST > was coming home too but he will be very soon :) 
AAAAUUUURRRRGGHHHH !!!!!!! 
so happy i'm finally pulling shit together :) 
Lame boring day off . Going to Justyna's to escape this heat ... and play with Damian ... I love that kid lol . 
I don't understand the point of a 10-room apartment ? Why not just buy a house ? 
i love my kid but gee whiz i'm glad he's asleep 
Finally home from work . Time to relax , if < PROPFIRST > lets me that is :) 
Okay so the US isn't the greatest place to be anymore but that still doesn't make it okay for everyone to hate everything about it . I don't understand why people come here and complain about how shitty it is compared to their country ... um , does the plane fly only one way ? Our government may suck ass but that does not mean I should be ashamed of where I come from and lived my whole life . 
So how many people lost/broke their phone this weekend ? I'm included in the 10 people I already know of that did :( 
Party at my house tonight ! Idk what kind of alcohol will be here but there will be a lot of it ! Now if I can only make it through 8 1/2 hours of work ... 
New phone , same number .... everyone text me so I can have your < PROPFIRST > again . 
partying haha i need to after a long week busting my ass and the a/c in the kitchen is BROKEN ..... FML ! lol 
Intervention !!!!! < PROPFIRST > text me if you're not sleeping 
I can't wait till tomorrow . I would be partying today but i have work tomorrow and my head is pounding . 
past my bedtime 
one more day of work to get through then party time !!!!! < PROPFEMALE > text me ! 
idc what anyone says i love TATU ... i get that the whole lesbian thing was for publicity ... who cares ??? i love their music <3 
saturday night no work no worries baby's sleeping yeahhh 
jeez just when i thought it was relaxation time ... oh well lol 
partying on sunday ... i'm a badddd girl . nah jk its a holiday , right ? 
hoarders <3 
I have a love-hate relationship with my whole life . 
i have bad news ... i ain't scared of you :) 
Can this world really be as sad as it seems ? - < PROPMALE > Reznor ..... I friggen love nine inch nails man . oh yeah .... happy birthday to me , i can finally drink legally lol 
Thanks everyone for all the birthday wishes ! :) 
in NJ recovering from all the drama , playing with < PROPFIRST > and gonna chill with my girls later ! so excited !!! 
< PROPFIRST > is NOT crying ... should I head for the bomb shelter ?? 
Back home to NY today ! I miss it so much ! :) 
facebook crashed ? is that why i couldn't get on today ? i thought my internet was just screwed lol 
So we're skipping fall this year . Awesome . I guess my new favorite season will be spring , even though that will probably be eliminated , too . :( 
strawberry blonde <3 
< PROPFIRST>'s smile is one thing I can see over and over again and still love it just as much every time ... I love my pookie face :) 
I like it when I love a song that's like 6 minutes long . 
All < PROPFEMALE > wants to friggen do is sleep his whole life away ... dude ! I'm 21 ! I'll sleep when I'm like 90 ! 
Paranormal Activity 2 : probably lame , but I wanna see it anyway . 
I might as well be single . In fact , I pretty much AM single . 
For the next 4 days all I gotta worry about is work , work , work and more work . Which is still drama , but the controllable kind . 
short day at work ... my feet are happy about this 
So my husband and and his \roommate\ " [ aka boyfriend ] just bounced from the house approximately 25 minutes ago to \ " look for my car . \ " My car is parked around the block . " 
Never tell anyone your problems . 20% don't care and the other 80% are glad you have them ! lol truee story 
Best living on dead hands down , less talk more here right now 
I just made a latte with chai tea and home made whipped cream and cinnimon ... the best thing I ever tasted . Starbucks kiss my ass ! 
People need to stay the fuck out of my life and my business . I have very few ( like , 3 ) people in my personal life and I'd like to keep it that way . 
< PROPFEMALE > is playing with Drano and saying \your mom\ " after everything I say . " 
All the crazy shit I did tonight ... that will be the best memories . I just wanna let shit go for tonight .. that will be the best therapy for me :) 
halloween party at my house ... hope this isn't a shitty idea lol but i wanna have fun !!! :) 
It's officially Halloween !!!!!!! <333 
So I'm going to start avoiding facebook when I'm wasted .... 
watching Teen Mom with Brandon .... All I need is some food and my life will be complete :) 
can't find the cord to charge my ipod ... fml . 
Dear Lord , \ 
you may have given me a ridiculously full plate but thank you for not adding obesity to my list of problems . God bless my metabolism . lol 
< PROPFEMALE > & I are married one year today . I can't believe it !!!!!!!! Nah JK I love my hubby :) 
How stable is a marriage when the wife is constantly getting kicked out of \her husband's\ " home . Fuck that . Independence is bliss . " 
I used to have a saving grace , unfortunately now I don't . All I can do is wipe my eyes and move on since the earth is gonna keep rotating anyway . 
wanna see < PROPMALE > potter SO BAD but gotta wait till next weekend :( 
you can't live in queens if you're a pussy . it will break you . 
Ugh ! I have been waiting to pee since 7AM ! My next apartment/house is gonna have 2 bathrooms minimum !!!!!!! 
Ugh . Idk how I'm gonna make it through work today 
one more hour ... then party !!!! 
ain't no sunshine when she's gone , only darkness everyday </3 
having the worst week so far 
I'd rather slip & fall in shit than fall in love with you :) 
First day without pookie : drowning my empty heart with grey goose ... hmm , not bad lol 
yeah don't bother leaving your house if you're in ridgewood 
Day 3 without pookie : tears & paranoia 
2011 is my year , I've already decided . 
I want the iphone 4 but if I ask my mom for it she'll probably spit out her coffee 
This cough medicine is so cool it's kinda like being stoned . I'm still coughing but at least I'm happy about it 
ok i understand that it's a really hard thing being white in nyc . trust me , i know . but that doesn't mean all you little girls out there need to start acting like you're black or puerto rican . just accept yourself for who you are ! for god's sake , just admit it : you're WHITE . nothing wrong with that ! just make sure to never say \i'm proud to be white\ " in public ... that is a hate crime in the US . " 
< PROPFIRST > is gonna have a girl over this afternoon :) 
can't wait for the new intervention at 9 ... time is passing slowly 
put away the lizard and lets start drinking already !!!!!! 
FINALLY full holy shit i've been eating like hog lately !!!! what is going on ??

I don't understand what makes a man hate another man , let me understand

this stomach virus sucks !!!! i wish i can eat !!!! but at least i'm skinny again lol 
needs a day off from everything , not just work 
worst day . good night . 
pookie is back in the hospital with borderline pnuemonia . i think its safe to say that spring needs to hurry its ass up . 
My son is not even 2 yet and since 18months he just hits , screams , cries and throws shit .... I better start saving up bail money now 
I AM SURROUNDED BY MORONS 
Banana ! 
Rahim , I love you and you are my reason for living , please never stop making music because your songs are seriously awesome & I can't stop listening to them 
ready for a party !!!!! < PROPFEMALE > i know you reading this lol 
In a drunk rage , for a reason beyond most humans , < PROPFEMALE > threw a candle at the stove , 2 hours and 1/2 a can of Ajax later the wax is finally gone . Next time I'm making him clean it when it's still hot ... with his tongue . 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > & everyone I know are sick except me ... I guess I'm too evil for germs to live inside me :) 
< PROPFIRST > is 2 years old today !!!!!! :O
