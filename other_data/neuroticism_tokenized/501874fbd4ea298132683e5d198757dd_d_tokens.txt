-Speak Out Without Speaking-

\A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history . \ " Mahatma Gandhi "

Memory < PROPFIRST > up in the headlights , has got me reminiscing on them good times , I'm turning off a real live drive and that's rights , I'm hitting easy street on mud tires , let's ride ? 
Forgive others . Forgiveness is the only way to heal your emotional wounds . Forgive those who hurt you no matter what they've done because you don't want to hurt yourself every time you remember what they did . When you can touch a wound and it doesn't hurt , then you know you have truly forgiven <3 
playing in the rain is worth catching a cold <3 
I'm gonna be freeeeeeee like a bird <3 
Turning in my Martins application . (: 
We don't hate men . We hate boys . Unfortunately there aren't very many men in this world . So basically we hate a bunch of people . (: haha 
Sleep tight . There are big dreams to be made <3 
Sitting outside (: 
You don't have to have one to be oneee (: 
Dance is your pulse , your heartbeat , your breathing . It's the rhythm of your life . It's the expression in time and movement , in happiness , joy , sadness and envy . <3

Going to the races . (: 
it was so good to be back home at the South Bend Motor Speedway , finally .... I wanna race sooo badd <3

\Let nature do the freezing and frightening and isolating in this world . Let men work and love and fight it off . \ " \

After so many nights of sleeping on a hard floor .... It actually feels weird to sleep in an actual bed . 
La vie est comme < PROPFEMALE > arc-en-ciel : il faut de la pluie et du soleil pour en voir < PROPMALE > couleurs :) 
I fall for pick up trucks ... not pick up lines .. 
God never ceases to amaze me and show me His love and comfort . 
there is only 1 way 2 say those 3 words 4 you .... I love you <3 
< PROPMALE > expériences du passé , bonnes ou mauvaises , contribuent à forger ce que nous sommes aujourd'hui :)

Piglet “how do you spell love ? ” Pooh “you don’t spell it .. you feel it” 
im not perfect . I’ll annoy you , tick you off say stupid things , and then take them back . But put all that aside , you’ll never find a girl that cares and loves you more than me <3 
I wish I may I wish I might that you will see the love I have for you , look at me and just hold me tight . 
I dislike the fact that people get mad at me for being nice ... I didn't know it was possible to be too nice /: 
i promise ill always be by your side no matter what happens . 
< PROPMALE > Dance Team car wash today 11-3 at Auto Zone on 933 ... $7 .. hope to see you there (: 
forever . 
I don't know how you do what you do\ 
I'm so in love with you\ 
It just keeps getting better\ 
\ 
I wanna spend the rest of my life\ 
With you by my side\ 
Forever and ever\ 
Every little thing that you do\ 
Baby , I'm amazed by you <3 
it’s been said that there’s one word that will free us from the weight and the pain of life . and that word is love . and I believe that . that doesn’t mean that it hasn’t been hard , or that it won’t be . it just means that i’ve found a stillness and a bravery in myself when I’m with you . you make me brave . and i will love you until the end of time . 
Cooking (: 
love is all about trUSt <3 
dreaming of you makes my nights worthwhile , just thinking of you makes me smile , being with you is the best thing ever and loving you is what I’ll do forever 
And don't fear it now , \ 
We're going all the way . \ 
That sun is shining on a brand new day . \ 
It's a long way down \ 
And it's a leap of faith \ 
But we're never giving up \ 
Cuz i know we've got a once in a lifetime love 
true love is rare and its the only thing that gives life real meaning . <3 
People dance because dance can change things . One move , can bring people together . One move , can make you believe like there's something more . One move , can set a whole generation free . <3 
so there is this girl , and shes my best friend and sister and I need her back in my life asap , i love her to death , <3 < PROPFEMALE > Lindquist 
leaving today for dance camp at ball state .. 
Long day ! Two and half more days just like it .. 
Jamba juice for breakfast ... I think so . 
Why don't you put your dance where your mouth is ... 
Can't sleep .... Too intrigued by the \light show\ " of constant lightening . I have never seen anything like it . " 
after a while you learn the difference between holding a hand and falling in love <3 
at the beach we live life differently .. we live by the currents , plan by the tides , and follow the sun . <3 
Cedar point ! <3 
so so so tired 
and in case you were wondering .. you mean everything to me <3 
But love , I’ve come to understand , is more than three words mumbled before bedtime . Love is sustained by action , a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day <3 
RIP < PROPMALE > ... We will all miss you ): 
speechless <3 
Love is a funny thing . it’s an intensely personal yet universal thing . it has a thousand definitions and not one of them gets it exactly right . it’s a feeling . it’s an experience . it’s inside of us and yet elusive . we < PROPFEMALE > it yet fear it . it’s the central experience of our lives and yet it remains a mystery . 
if you love someone , if you truly love someone , you’ll put aside foolish pride and fear and love them without regret , without worry , because you know that without them there’s no reason for caring . 
Well that was stupid .. Moving on to better things haha 
Riverfest < on the river 
you are , and always have been , my dream ? 
Lake <3 
Im so glad God made these fly over states (: 
Days like these wanna make them last ? 
\Act as if what you do makes a difference . It does . \ " \ 
i'm pretty much the luckiest girl alive .. 
Chicago <3 
Chicago is way to crazy for me /: 
The lack of care and concern for other people that i see makes me so sad ): 
World pulse festival ! 
Lunch and movie with my amazing boyfriend (: 
Falling in love with a stranger was the best thing that has ever happened to me . <3 
At the < PROPMALE > game with my amazing boyfriend , < PROPMALE > , who i love so freaking much .... 
She's I want a piece of chocolate\ 
Take me to a movie\ 
She's I can't find a thing to wear\ 
Now and then she's moody\ 
She's a Saturn with a sunroof\ 
With her brown hair a-blowing\ 
She's a soft place to land\ 
And a good feeling knowing\ 
She's a warm conversation\ 
She's a fighter when she's mad\ 
And she's a lover when she's loving 
believe in your dreams .. ' cause they might actually come true <3 
So many chiefs and not enough Indians 
last day of the best summer of my life ... also last day at work with my new best friend , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Gatchel <3 
It's our last , first day (: 
I have goals , I have dreams , and I have a wonderful and amazing future ahead of me . But my future is going to come faster then you think . I need to be let of the nest . I'm not so little anymore . Please stop treating me like I'm three and more like the adult I am soon to become . Because I am ready ... And you need to be too . 
you are more important than you realize . 
love is not a fight , but it's something worth fighting for 
everyday I get through is just another day closer to my dreams <3 
Snowpants ? Blanket ? Snuggie !!! 
I appreciate every little thing you do , from the way you hug me , to the way you treat me . everything is wonderful when I am with you . i know i've made mistakes and i'll probably make many more . but all I want to do is live my life dedicated to you and love you for the rest of my life . you are the best thing that has ever happened to me < PROPMALE > Bucher . i love you so much . forever and ever . 
Jesus take the wheel , take it from my hands , ' cause i cant do this on my own , I'm letting go , to Jesus take the wheel <3 
I am really glad that I have found someone that I can trust and love so much . I am definitely extremely lucky and blessed . he really is the love of my life <3 
Seriously 4 dollars for a 20 oz coke ... Thats ridiculous 
Just got off of work .. Gonna go home and watch some ND football with my amazing boyfriend (: 
< PROPMALE > Bucher loves me way more <3 
sometimes that mountain you've been climbing\ 
is just a grain of sand\ 
and what you've been up there searching for forever \ 
is in your hands\ 
oh when you figure out love is all that matters after all\ 
it sure makes everything else seem so small <3 
Michigan City with my amazing boyfriend < PROPMALE > Bucher <3 
We were meant to be together \ 
Thats why \ 
We can roll with the punches \ 
We can stroll hand in hand \ 
And when I say its forever \ 
You understand \ 
That youre always in my heart \ 
Youre always on my mind \ 
And when it all becomes too much \ 
Youre never far behind \ 
And theres no one that comes close to you \ 
Could ever take your place \ 
Cause only you can love me this way \ 
I couldve turned a different corner \ 
I couldve gone another place \ 
But Id anever had this feeling \ 
That I feel today < PROPMALE > Bucher 
My mind is a year ahead of me .. 
RIP tippy < PROPFEMALE > ):

It's gonna be a great day <3 
i dont know how he puts up with my random mood swings , how he fits right in with my family , makes me smile when I want to cry , has fit himself into all my dreams , and makes me miss him when he's in the same house as me ... but what I do know is ... is that I have an amazing boyfriend and I am extremely lucky to have him and I wouldn't change it for anything in this world .. because I love him with all my heart , forever and ever . <3

This school seriously makes me want to cry 
This is senior year ... This is living it up ... ( : 
secret sister's luncheon today 
today has taught me a lot about myself . <3 
Living my life to the fullest , trusting in God to get me through it , and knowing that at the end of the day what is meant to be will always find its way <3 
God gave me you for the ups and downs\ 
God gave me you for the days of doubt\ 
And for when I think I lost my way\ 
There are no words here left to say , it’s true\ 
God gave me you <3 
it's just another day closer <3 
I'm at hacienda with my amazing boyfriend who I love sooooo much <3
