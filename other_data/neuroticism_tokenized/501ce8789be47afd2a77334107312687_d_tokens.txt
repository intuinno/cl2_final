This is the day , this is the day , that the Lord has made , that the Lord has made . I will rejoice , I will rejoice , and be glad in it , and be glad in it ! 

This , being one of the most wonderful days of my life , A New Beginning , as if the first day all over again ! Life is grand when you get a second < PROPMALE > ! 
Today is always a good day , and tomorrow will be better ! 
While you SCREAM at your woman , theres a man \ 
wishing he could talk softly into her ear . \ 
\ 
While you HUMILIATE , INSULT , and OFFEND her , there is a man filrting with her reminding her how wonderful she is . \ 
While you HURT your women , there is a man wishing he \ 
could love her . \ 
While you make your women cry , there is a man stealing smiles from her . \ 
Post this on your wall if your against \ 
Domestic Violence 
Never met so many touchy people in my life until I got out here on facebook ! And it weird though , how people can suffer so many things in life , the death of a loved one , loss of a home or job , divorce or bad health , but when it comes to the truth , people just can't seem to tolerate it , it's to much for them to bear ! Well , when you start putting on the breastplate of righteous , you be able to withstand anything ! 
STAGES OF INSANITY : 1 . Talks to self 2 . Argues with self 3 . Loses argument with self 4 . Is no longer talking with self 
Today has been such a disapointment ..... 
Happy Belated Thanksgiving Everyone , It's Been A Great Year !!!
