Well its officaly 2010 . Its gonna take for ever to get used 2 sayin that . 

I hate feeling like this . I'm so tired of tring to fight this . I'm asleep and all i dream of is waking to you . Tell me that you will listen . Your touch is what im missing . And the more i hide I relize i'm slowly losing you-Skillet : Comatose 
How bout them redskins 27-17 
Today I’m gonna try a little harder . Gonna make every minute last longer . Gonna learn to forgive and forget . ’Cause we don’t have long , gonna make the most of it-one day to late{skillet ] 
Hopes that 2010 will be alot better than 2009 
ok so 2010 was alrite but hopefully 2011 is gonna be better ! 
Cards and flowers on your window . Your friends all plead for you to stay . Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple . Sometimes goodbye's the only way . -Shadow of the Day , linkin Park

\Can you feel it crush you ? Does it seem to bring the worst in you out ? There's no running away from these things that hold you down . Do they complicate you because they make you feel like this ? Of all the colors that you've shined this is surely not your best . \"" 
\Holding on is harder than it seems . When you're reaching for so much more . Seems so much easier to just give in . When you're reaching for so much more . \"" 
\Another wasted Saturday so here I stay . Where nothing seems to ever change anyway hey . All this hype about life bein ' great . Where's the love for me these days . I'm goin off the deep end . \"" 
\These are my words that I've never said before . I think I'm doin ' okay . And this is the smile . I've never shown before . Somebody shake me . Cause I must be sleeping . \"" 
Everything you say to me . Takes me one step closer to the edge . And I'm about to break . I need a little room to breathe . Cause I'm one step closer to the edge . I'm about to break . 
\It’s not me it’s you . Always has been you . All the lies and stupid things you say and do . It’s not me it’s you . All the lies and pain you put me through . I know that it’s not me it’s you . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > lost : ( 
\Let’s get the story straight . You were a poison . You flooded through my veins . You left me broken . You tried to make me think . That the blame was all on me . With the pain you put me through . And now I know that it’s not me it’s you \"" 
\Your secrets and regrets Are keeping you from going very far . And you can't let all this get you down . And keep you living in the dark . \"" 
butler lossed : ( 
\Because these words were never easier for me to say or for her to second guess . But I guess that I can live without you . But without you I'll be miserable at best . \"" 
\What if I just pulled myself together . Would it matter at all ? What if I just tried not to remember . Would it matter at all ? All the chances that have passed me by . Would it matter if I gave it one more try ? Would it matter at all ? \"" 
\I'm strong on the surface . Not all the way through . I've never been perfect . But neither have you . \""
