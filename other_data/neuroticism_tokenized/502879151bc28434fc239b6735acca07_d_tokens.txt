I hope that everyone in the States is able to enjoy the festivities of the 4th of July ! Have a drink for me ! 

Letting go ... 
Life is full of decisions ... sometimes making those decisions are difficult yet necessary . Always remember to take care of you first ... everything else will follow ! 
What is really going on ? GB beat the Bears ... c'mon Bears we can do better ... 
Another week ... another win~Let's go Bears ! 
Life is always throwing curve balls ... at what point do you just go for it verses standing your ground ? 
I am enjoying this newness ! 
wonders when she will cross paths with honest to God genuine people ... I am so tired of wishing for the best in people and being dissapointed time and time again ... 
is so pleased to see that there are still people that believe in Social Justice and keeping literature in the school systems ... 
is trying to fights this flu bug off ... 
About to step out on faith ... 
Thought bad things happen in 3's ... Since January I have lost 6 loved ones and I have a 7th approaching quickly . I don't know how much more loss my mind , spirit and body can take ... I feel so lost ! 
is such an advocate of education . Whether it be traditional or situational , I feel that educating yourself is the best gift one can hone ! Be adventurous , don't be afraid to dream and dream big ! 
Trying to forget the day to day stressers and concentrate on some good old fashioned Football !

I take my promotion exam tomorrow and my supervisor calls me at COB to tell me that I have an interview scheduled TOMORROW for a job at AFDW .... as if I don't have enough on my plate ... Pray for me please ... I just need to be able to focus on this test , get promoted , blow away this interview and continue to progress in this great Air Force I am in ! 
This is what I have been waiting on all day ! Today I root for Green Bay ... This should be an awesome game !

I know folks have been hating on my Bears but just wait and see ! I am putting my books to the side for the rest of the day ... FB is calling my name ! LET'S WATCH SOME FOOTBALL ! 
Alright ... we lost ... AGAIN . Not sure why an NFL team plays worst than the teams the MIGHTYMEN used to play back when folks like < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > were tearing up the field ! No playofs for the Bears ... Ya'll can go ahead and start with your criticism ... 
Let's See what N.O. is about to do to those Cowboys ...

Okay Colts .... you have your spot ! 
So I am 2-2 today ! The Saints will get sent home by the Colts in two weeks ! Good stuff !! It was so worth sweating and hacking through this game tonight ! 
The fact that I keep feeding the toilet is taking my appetite away . They say it gets better but when .... 
20-30 Inches of Snow ... Wow ... 
Let's go Colts ! 
I cannot believe this ... WTF 31-17 Saints ? Wow ... 
So it is official -- I have the new FB interface ! It's different , but I am trying to accept it ...

Let's go Bulls ! 
Okay , I officially feel old ... I'm at my sister Joy's graduation ... I am so proud of her ! 
I have never felt pain like this before ... I tore my quad during PT today . Now I have to try and slow my role . At this moment , my drugs are maintaining me ... I pray for a speedy recovery . 
So , I have been on my leg all day and am finally back at home icing my thigh . I truly surprised myself with the amount of pain I was able to tolerate today . One more day and I will be laid up all weekend ... these are the times I wish I were still young ! 
Another day of minimized mobility ... the pain is subsiding and I am soooo ready to start working my way back into my daily PT routine ... thank you everyone for your prayers !
