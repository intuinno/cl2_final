The man who loves his country on its own account , and not merely for its trappings of interest or power , can never be divorced from it , can never refuse to come forward when he finds that she is engaged in dangers which he has the means of warding off ...

In 2006 , a man in Arkansas accidentally hit the bass boost button on his home theater remote during a < PROPFIRST > Mays infomercial . We only know this because last December , a team of forensic experts dressed in radiation-proof suits had finished their meticulou

Mr. T once tried to throw < PROPFIRST > Mays . Instead of grabbing < PROPFIRST > , however , Mr. T found only a bucket of OxiClean in his hands . He immediately sought atonement through cleaning his gold chains . After hearing a < PROPFIRST > Mays infomercial , R . < PROPFIRST > Ermey reconsider

We wonder why the Middle East is so mad at us but we don't seem to look at the human effect of it . Sure , we see the pictures and feel bad for a few moments but then we go right back to what we were doing . How would you feel if your Mom was killed or your house destroyed by a foreign force ?

bullshited , MacGyvered and hated his way out of two traps ! I love it when a plan comes together . 
Does anybody know the order for AP Euro presentations ? 
thinks the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the best idea anyone has ever had . < PROPMALE > Quatermain > H.M. < PROPMALE > 
( To whom it may concern ) I'm sorry that you hate me but you'll have to take a ticket and get in line like everybody else to have the privilege of hating me . 
I got my room temperature at 80 degrees , I have Transporter 3 playing on the Blu-ray and I have bowl of peaches with iced tea . Today is a good day . 
got a 100% just by winging it today for his AP Euro project .... 
In the spirt of St. < PROPFIRST>'s day I leave you with what generally happens when a friend ( the guy on the left ) and I ( the guy on the right ) try to invent something . The videos are only 30 seconds each lol http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THbhE8pu0MM&feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQPU_UZda7M&feature=related 
it appears I have been outsmarted .... again ! ( dun dun dun ) 
Is there any country without any stupid people and that would tolerate my presence ? Just asking . 
is leaving for Munich then Istanbul if all goes acording to plan when I arrive at the gate . I will not be in contact much for 2 weeks while I am in Europe so I'll see you guys later ! 
I seriously think Europe is now better than the United States , for those of you who know , all those useless skills I have are actually put to use ! Munich was great because the Airport/City were all laid out perfectly in a circle ( thanks to Herr Brill for navigational help ) . Istanbul has been fun with tea and coffee cake while socializing with complete strangers . ( Now I go for more tea ) 
I have come to the conclusion that people don't understand a damn word I am saying most of the time and think I am crazy ( Even the Europeans ) . Friends excluded , I would like to think that there is another person(s ) who would understand what I think and see things like I do but I doubt it . They are either too afraid of what others would think of them , haven't met me or are an invention of my own insanity ! 
While I was wondering around Topkapi Palace , I got pulled into a < PROPMALE > Group that was pretty relaxed and friendly . They took pleasure in one-upping me with their awesome phones and engineering technology . I now hate Italians ( assholes ) and the English ( stuck-up ) . The Welsh , < PROPMALE > s , ( is this a sign of the Apocalypse ? ) and French were all nice to me for some reason . ( They helped me hate on the Italians and English ) 
What would happen if I was given command of a U.S. Army Corps/Marine Expeditionary Force/ N.A.T.O. Response Force ? 
is chillin ' like a villain 
I didn't get to finish uploading the photo albums or even the first one's captions so I will finish them later because I must go visit an old friend who I like 
( Insert deserving person here ) You need to check yourself before you wreck yourself because I'm coming back to drive the Hate Train and fly the Hatredcopter to bring presents to all the little \good\ " boys and girls . " 
is back ..... in the UNITED STATES OF < PROPFEMALE > !!! ( Fear me for I have European Hatorade and I am not afraid to share ) 
AN ALBUM COVER and FOREIGN FLICKS 
I do believe customs has just given me the middle finger .... 
I'm sorry but Nice < PROPFIRST > isn't here right now . He was \dealt with\ " by Asshole < PROPFIRST > who promptly drove his Hatredcopter into him . I don't think Nice < PROPFIRST > will be back for awhile so please leave a message after the beep . * BEEP * " 
Murphy's Law : Anything that can go wrong , will go wrong ///// < PROPFIRST>'s Law : Murphy was an optimist 
To all Southerners celebrating the new \Confederate History Month\ " : (<PROPFIRST>'s comments ) YOU LOST THE WAR SOUTHERNERS !!!!!!!! GIVE UP !!!!!!! ( If they get to have Confederate History Month than we should have \ " Sherman's March to the Sea\ " Month ) " 
I had really nice and relaxing day ( no stupid people bothered me either ! ) 
Justified = New favourite show 
Iced Tea , Peaches , and a nice episode of Justified is what I'm enjoying 
Am I the only person who finds it ironic that in Rambo III that the Taliban are protrayed as the good guys who save the day ? ( The movie was shot in 1989 ) 
I don't know , I just work here 
< PROPMALE > Français ne sont pas < PROPFEMALE > bienvenu ici , je < PROPFEMALE > s hais parce que j'ai traité avec < PROPFEMALE > urs pairs . Vous ne pouvez pas me tromper français ... Je ne suis pas l'Américain moyen .... 
Here are some pictures of the Iceland Volcano eruption and the ash cloud aftermath . Btw I totally support the E . U . ' s decision to cancel all flights in their air space and I would have extended the ban till the 28th at least . http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/04/more_from_eyjafjallajokull.html 
saw Avatar for the first time .... 
has decided that yelling stuff in an English accent sounds much better than yelling stuff in an American accent 
is thinking .... 
has pissed off his parents again by not having picked a college or career he wants to get into yet . ( Lol I deserve a cookie for not knowing either of those yet anyway ) 
Its nice talking to your Grandparents when you are the favourite ( My Grandparents are the shit ) 
Justified + Bowl of Peaches + Iced Tea ( Sun tea to be specific ) = Happy < PROPFIRST > ! :D 
is the proper term \color\ " or \ " colour \"?" 
< PROPFIRST>'s Next Year Schedule : 1 . ???? 2 .???? 3 . ???? 4/5/6 . ???? 7 . AP U.S. History 8 . Chinese 9 . Computer Intergrated Manufacturing 
The weather is excellent ! 
I'm bored 
Did anybody else watch < PROPFIRST > the Tank Engine when they were little ? 
What should < PROPFIRST > do this summer ? 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Hopper ( we will never have a better crazy bad guy actor again ... ) 
Top Gear should write a set of \10 commandments\ " for cars " 
is too lazy to write a real status update 
seriously wants the A-Team movie to come out because the \legit\ " copy hasn't been released yet in the U.S. " 
is watching \Der Rote Baron\ " ( I love biplane dogfights ) " 
USA TIED WITH ENGLAND 1-1 !!!!!!!!!!!! ( And they said the U.S. didn't have a < PROPMALE > ) 
is decidedly bored , anybody have a suggestion on how to fix this situation ? 
Do you guys know what the most annoying sound in the world is ? 
BP should hire me to fix their problem because I'm < PROPFIRST > and that is all the qualification I need . 
will be leaving for Tucson tommorow ( stupid 6 a.m. departure time ) 
asks everybody to observe a moment of silence for the tragic death of his Rayban Aviators 
I am now depressed because the U.S. lost to Ghana thus being kicked out of the World Cup . Now my allegiance lies with England and I am confident that they will win in the upcoming England vs . Germany match . ENGLAND PREVAILS !!! 
DEUTSCHLAND MUSS NICHT GEWINNEN DAS WELT TASSE !!!!!! DAMN YOU GERMANY !!!! ( Poor England , you will be missed from the World Cup ) 
I hate my country , those bastards at TSA jooed up my razor so now I haven't been able to shave in days . Also United Airlines and the city of Tucson have gone up on my list . United's flights all landed early and Tucson has beautiful roads and at least 2 Rolls-Royces . 
Obvious Troll Truck is obvious 
has everybody dropped off the face of the earth or am I just going insane ? 
I'm sorry , I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am . 
Wouldn't it be cool if the United States was still part of the British Empire ? 
Seriously , sometimes I think Americans shouldn't be allowed to invent things because only we could come up with a Bulldozer that is a hybrid ( and uses diesel fuel ) 
is watching a Burn Notice Marathon on USA of the show's \Greatest Villains\ " ( < PROPFIRST > nominates < PROPFEMALE > ) " 
Why is that when people ask for help for a \few minutes\ " it turns into a few hours ? " 
misses Group B rally cars .... 
I think all Engineers have at least a mild form of OCD 
I'm pretty sure the week I have had beats just about anything you guys did . 
WikiLeaks just released nearly 92,000 classified documents that came from an anonymous high ranking \source\ " ( Gen . McChrystal ) in the U.S. Army . These dated 2004 to 2010 .... We've been flat out lied too and apparently the War is not going well at all . ( Side Note : Why is NATO fighting our war ? ) " 
Finished < PROPFIRST > Adams !!!!!! 
Reasons why I should be a spy : I can blend in with local populations , I speak multiple languages , I work well with others , I can lie with a strait face , I'm a quiet person and I look like a trustworthy person ( plus I'm American which is the best help of all ) 
Summer was nice while it lasted but I still feel like I've been robbed of those 2 extra weeks by those bastards on the school board . ( How dare they try and make finals scheduling easier ! ) 
I seriously hate Woodstock sometimes . I suppose its just the overall lack of upkeep , give-a-damn and the fact that its a \small town\ " ( redneck would be a better term but not everybody is one ) " 
I'm glad I work better under pressure 
Our AP U.S. History class makes me want to kill myself out of boredom 
Can't sleep 
it appears somebody has tried to assassinate me today ... You failed ! HA ! ( I did have to leave school early though ) 
I will kill myself before I work in an office building with a cubicle ... Seriously , how can people stand to be in those things without going crazy ? 
( Favourite scene from the movie\In Bruges \") * < PROPMALE > throws his phone at the wall * \ 
My give-a-damn is busted , so I just decided to type the damn AP US History notes . Honestly I don't have the < PROPFEMALE > to write out 4 pages of notes . ( Side Note : I talked to the Mechanic , he can't seem to find the right parts for my give-a-damn ) 
is a \Law Abiding Citizen \"" 
failed at life today 
Here is the SNL < PROPFIRST > Connery vs . < PROPFIRST > Trebeck skit I keep telling you guys about\ 
http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/14938/ 
\I'll be your huckleberry . \ " - Doc Holiday " 
Book Notes are a monument to the stupidity of mankind 
Dear Icebergs , \ 
\ 
Sorry to hear about that Global Warming , < PROPFEMALE>'s a bitch ain't it . \ 
- Sincerely , The Titanic 
Now that I saw Iron Man 2 again ..... I want < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr. ' s next new movie to come out ( Sherlock Holmes 2 but thats about a year away ) 
Paint-balling was fun and I think we earned our victory today 
I think I'll make the best of this whole global warming thing ( it keeps the weather warm ) 
I just realized I said \Back-traced your connection\ " today in class . Congratulations if you get the joke behind this . ( Pro-tip : The consequences will never be the same ! ) " 
Why are the French allowed to build planes ? 
\Hey < PROPFIRST > 
Only I would pick the one career they don't have for job shadowing ... Fml \ 
( and why didn't they have any Engineering ones ? Are they that stupid ? ) 
Parent : What the hell game are you looking at ref ?!?!?! \ 
Me : Would you like some cheese with that whine ? Or might I recommend the humble pie and a nice big glass of \shut the fuck up\ " to wash it down with ? \ 
I love the reaction on a hybrid or electric car owner's face when I tell them that the battery has cobalt in it and that comes from a conflict zone in Africa . ( Chalk that up under reasons why \diesel kicks ass \")" 
< PROPFEMALE > is fucked , I'm going to Switzerland . \ 
Fuck this shit I'm out of here \ 
* Hits eject button * 
Well either God hates me or Murphy's Law just struck again . Can't tell which one at the moment . 
I got my Driver's License ! ( insert evil laugh here ) 
Get him to the Greek 
( Scene from < PROPFIRST > Hood ) \ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > the Lionheart : Remember England lads ! Onwar- * HEADSHOT * 
I test drove a bunch of cars today , including \ 
a \Broken Mechanical Wreck\ " ( BMW ) and a \ " Flipped Over Roadside Disaster\ " ( Ford ) " 
I woke up from the most awesome dream ever only to find out that it wasn't real life :( 
* facepalm * We use CUSTOMARY not METRIC , get with the program people\ 
( Damn you Europe !!!! Measurements shouldn't make sense ) 
I got rejected for giving blood ... Again \ 
( Apparently AB doesn't mean it can be used on both A and B bloodtypes ) 
We should all give Wikileaks a round of applause \ 
( and perhaps a < PROPMALE > Prize as well ) 
I love my new car(Also , turn off TCS and drive in the rain to feel like a badass . Trust me , I just did it ) 
Snow is lame , seriously lame . Nobody likes it and it only creates trouble . 
Somehow I got pulled into being a coach for a 5th/6th grade basketball team , I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing . 
Mom : I think you're putting the cart before the horse\ 
Me : Really ? < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > told me that is a good idea\ 
Mom : * Facepalm * 
I woke up today , walked through the doors into school and realized that I'm the only sane person out of the whole lot of you . ( well most of you ) 
Today was a shitty day 
I think when they designed my car , the engineers thought \What would < PROPFIRST > want ? \"" 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > was a scholar and a Gentleman 
I just had a really screwed up dream , I really hope that is not my subconscious trying to tell me something 
My thoughts on finals : \Everything went better than expeceted \"" 
I got a Tom-Tom and downloaded Sgt . R < PROPFIRST > Ermy's voice to use for guidance , I am now officially a bad-ass . 
I saw a Volvo 240 today AFTER I watched \True Grit\ " . \ 
Saw Tron , drove a < PROPMALE > ( and did drifts ) , watched the Burn Notice Marathon and went to < PROPFEMALE > Garden . I'm pretty awesome , U jelly ? 
I think those stories we wrote in AP US will turn out very good . \ 
( Especially the one with that Bavarian family ) 
I am having the most epic case of Troll's remorse right now 
Teenagers ... We still drive better than Soccer Moms . 
You wat , you lose 
I may be wrong but I doubt it 
My friends are the worst influence on my driving habits . 
You know you might be a bit of a ricer when you call your parent's phone and they set your phone's ring-tone to \Tokyo Drift\ " . \ 
Aggravating Woman : Which field is Team 3 playing on ? \ 
Me : I don't know , I just work here . Go check the far field to see . \ 
( Head Ref walks over ) Head Ref : You realize that her match is on this field , right ? \ 
Me : Yep 
Got a haircut , went to ACT Prep ( nearly died of boredom ) then rally raced home . 
My Doctorate in procrastination has just been confirmed . I did about 3 months of work in about 2 days . Thanks to my friends who kept me from completely failing , I owe you guys one . 
I went to Chicago Autoshow ..... Only to find out that I can't fit into half of them 
Nothing of interest happened today 
This just in : Nobody gives a fuck 
Same shit , different day 
Apparently I looked like more a pretentious douche-bag than usually today . \ 
My response : and this is a problem why ? 
I don't have any idea of what I want to do when I get older . Its tough to decide whether or not I want to be a soulless bastard of a lawyer or an environmental wrecking ball as a Petroleum Engineer . 
I had an excellent day . I woke up late and wasted away the afternoon by enjoying tea and toast while reading the latest Car & Driver and Road & Track . Then I took a small nap and played some Minecraft . I had a very productive day . 
The day started out shitty but ended quite nicely 
I'm so good at procrastinating , I did all my book notes in one night 
Why are people saying \Remember < PROPFEMALE > Harbor\ " when they mention the Japanese Tsunami . We payed Japan back ... with interest . I am disgusted that people would hope for a higher death toll than there already will be . " 
Well I got 3 < PROPMALE > projects due by Friday , no cooperation by co-workers on two of them . The ACT 36 test is tomorrow and I'm running way late on an engineering project ( about 2 weeks to make up in day ) . The question is , can I pull this one off ? 
I finished all the projects . However , Murphy strikes again . The helicopter blew up on my last test run , and my wind turbine had is airfoils mounted backwards which led to a quite interesting situation . In my defense , people don't remember who won the race . They only ever remember who had the most epic crash . 
I think I may have gone a little overboard on Saturday . I made a few mean jokes that I shouldn't have . I regressed back into asshole mode , and I liked it .... alot . Oh well . I am debating whether to keep playing nice or go back into asshole mood permanently . What should I do ? 
Today was a great day until I got busted for speeding . Its funny for the moment but when I face the judge I have feeling I won't be laughing . 
My friends have pointed something out . My life isn't very normal . 
I screwed up on a level like < PROPFIRST > Sheen .... Am I a \winner\ " yet ? " 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Black , \ 
I hate you more than you can ever imagine\ 
Sincerely , \ 
< PROPFIRST > Basaran 
Well , I can't find my AP U.S. book . What the hell do I do now ? 
I found my AP U.S. book ! Now to do 8 book note assignments within a single night . ( I'm not sure what was worse , knowing I didn't have my book or realizing how many assignments I'm behind ) 
I'm in < PROPMALE > , Texas visiting Rice University and University of < PROPMALE > . Funny story : I am too tall for the new Airport Security Machines , fml . ( but I did fly 1st class on the flight down ) 
Rice University is offering a < PROPMALE > in International Relations for people who want to be diplomats . I got told that I'm an excellent candidate . I wonder what would happen if I decided to be a diplomat ?
