Wow , what a week ...... there were ups and downs , smiles and frowns , tears of joy , and tears of sadness , good times , and not so good times , restlessness , and now i'm ready for peace . Hoping TOMORROW BRINGS YOU AND ME A SENSE OF INNER CALMNESS , to gather strength to face another week ...... : S 
There is a dark cloud hanging over me , it is darkening my path , and i am afraid of falling into a deep dark hole , my heart is heavy and my fears many ......... will my burning tears be like fire to somehow lite my way or further weigh me down ........................... 
MUST SAY , WHEN IT RAINS .... IT POURS !!!!! 
By Anonymous You will never know What love is Until it drops you to your knees And chokes your breath So that to breathe is a challenge , And your tear-stained pillows Remind you of the love That nestled close to you And saw your nakedness And all your imperfections , And loved you just the same . 
I'll be sleeping with a smile tonight , first time this week : 0 
Was a great weekend , one not to forget . Great people , fun places , and friends i < PROPFEMALE > . Thank you ........

Just talked to my Dad in Mars < PROPFEMALE > . Was almost 70 degree last week , thats warmer than when i was there this summer ....... I should go back now , I WISH , to enjoy the weather and visit .......... I so miss the family ....... Wish life was easier ........!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I am finding more people feeling the way about their life that i feel . They are not living to their potential . They are being held back , and they are planning to find a way to live life to the fullest . Good , bad , at least they want to take a < PROPMALE > . For is it A LIFE if you are suffering in the situation you are in , or a waste of precious time . Only one person can be the judge of this ........ 
Confusion , heavy heart , missing loved ones ........ It's been too long , at a loss for words ....... 
I'm so frustrated , i wish i could go out running to cool off ....... but again , not here , cannot be done ...

“Your time is limited , so don't waste it living someone else's life . Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking . Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition . They somehow already know what you truly want to become . Everything else is secondary . ” < PROPMALE > Jobs quote 
I'm with you ,..... dont know who you are ,..... I'm with you .........

They say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don’t hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but that you will always love them . Re-post if you have at least one friend like this ... Thank God for them

My impassioned heart beats for this ardent sky . . . My sights set souly upon your soil .... May the time come , for serenity to be mine , and new beginnings therefore shine 
An old lady once said ... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living ~ 
THE SILENCE IS SO LOUD .............. 
Days like today , i almost feel EMOTIONALLY ALERGIC TO LIFE ......... 
I'ld like to logout on more than just FB .......... 
When you're down , in a dark place ,,,, its suprising how a < PROPFIRST > of lite can find its way .... in the sounds of a song ... or a call from a long time friend ....... when you least expect it !!!!! so < PROPFEMALE > in there babe ............. 
Coffee and chat time can just block out the rest of the world for a while ........ relief ! Tx for both ... = ) 
feeling like i want to stir up things , whatz your reaction ,,,,,,,, 
Being < PROPFEMALE > , ....... i FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE OUT CELEBRATING ...... SLUSHISHLY !!!!!! 
May this day be full of FUN , LAUGHTER , GOOD DANCE MUSIC , AND KNEES THAT LET ME DANCE !!!!! = l
