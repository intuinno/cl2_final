You Break My Heart </3 Cause your Afriad , Afriad of what you will go through . That's a shame , I promised you ; I'll always be here . But if you want to run away then go ahead . I'm not gonna hold on to you & beg you to stay . Leave , go hide your feelings for me . Even though it kills me to know that I can't have you . I'm happy that this time , I'm not the one being a coward . 
The past is done with , Holding on to it doesn't change it . Just makes you think of what if ; I did that , said this , left early .. You just gotta focus on what you have , not what you had . Things do happen for a reason . The only thing you have left to do , is move on . Start new , make new history (: || ugh I need sleep .. Lol ||

Love is what makes the world go round . Love is going to hurt , break , and confuse you . But its also going to make you happy , understand way more , and know why ,, no matter how much you try you can never get that one person off your mind , cause that's true love . No matter the pain they caused , that's what builds your love & makes it stronger . <3 
</3 
Good Morning Everybody . Going to get ready for church . :) 
Today was actually a good day :) 
Goodnight . 
c ( = 
Mmm .. Not liking the weather we been having . I want the cold rainy days back . :) 
Ugh hating the weather , its to hot . 
The weekend , yay ! Finally I can rest , and sleep in . <3 
Going to take my puppy for a walk .. It feels like i'm getting sick again :( 
So as I was walking my dog , I saw this really small thing on the street and yelled Get Off The Street ! [ cause there were cars ] Lol .. and run towards it , at first I thought it was an hamster then i look closer & it had a little tail , i was confused , but didnt care what it was & tired 2 help it , as i was doing that , 
<3 Time will heal you , and forgiving & forgetting will help you let go of your past , Living life isn't always easy , but you just gotta keep your head up and have faith , great things will happen . <3 
Had a great day , didn't know I would . But the weather is beautiful , the friends made me laugh & smile . Yeah I'm done with letting things or people bring me down . <3 <3

Blahh ... 
God sometimes makes us go through the worst of things , && get hurt . To build us up , and to prove us no matter whats at the end , he's still there . Keep Your Head Up . 
My sister is going to buy me a Startbucks (: ( ThankYou ) . Hmm .. what to do .. what to dooo ... 
Going to the friends house with the siblings (: To watch the Pacquiao fight , then come home && watch the UFC fight . :) Then talk to my cutie <3 
Goodnight . </33 
These last couple days , I felt like I been missing something . That I need someone to be with me , Someone to make me know how love feels again . Then I realized , who am I kidding , boys will be boys , all I need is god's love and I'll make it . <3 
WHy is everyone doing that question thing .. \ 
Send me questions in my inbox , and ill answer them :) 
Q : do you lyk being single ?? \ 
\ 
\ 
A : Mmmm .. Single is great and all , but to be honest , I like to have someone I can call mine . 
Didn't go to school today , just woke up like an hour ago , now going to my moms work and come back in like an hour i hope . 
Blahh .. 
Ughh ........ \ 
8/ 
Just cam back from a walk to the gas station , and i threw up on the way home .. x.X ughh it was horrible ! My tummy still hurts .. Blahh ... i hate this .. 
It takes a real man to know how beautiful a girl is by getting to know her . Sees her for who she is , a man who doesn't like just what he sees , but sees past the cover up . Someone who doesn't just fall for the looks but the beauty within . Yeah no all girls are pretty , but not all pretty girls are worth your time . Looks are deceiving , open your heart , and stop pushing the real woman away . 
I donated blood today <3 Feel good about that , now to enjoy a week off of school , Yes ! && hopefully I can get to see him .. 
I need a cell phone . >.< Man I love the weather !!!!!!!!!!!! If I could I would go walking for < PROPMALE > <3 .... Well UFC fight tonight , gotta get ready , then off where ever my brother take me . :) 
Didn't go anywhere to watch the fight places were packed , gonna watch it at home . 
Today looks so beautiful , I think I'll take my doggy for a walk in a bit (: Having an alright weekend so far . Can't wait til Thanksgiving going to help out a lot of people at church <3 
Just woke up a while back , now to get ready , and hopefully still be able to go to mi amigas casa . 
Life proves to me that holding on to someone or something only ends up hurting you in the end , I don't want to let _____ go but if thats what I have to do , then I guess its what right . 
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
Good Morning Everyone <3 Just got out of the shower (: Now to put my music super loud and Clean hopefully I can finish the whole house within an hour and a half .. =] 
Lalalalalala I'm so bored , but yet have so much energy .. ahhh .... 
I want a cell phone ! D: 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone <3 Hope you all have a good day . 
Well my thanksgiving is going great . I'm super full ( x && I'm thankful for the family I got , I'm thankful that god gave me what I have . <3 <3 <3 
| <3 | 
everytime we fight you cry and i'm sittng here asking myself why we try to get along , to hold on girl i just don't know why we don't move on , baby lets move on , you don't know whether we will get better .. girl there ain't no turning back , you know i hate to tell you that , girl you think you got me up ahead but ... </3 
As time passes I realize how dumb , people really are . Also how dumb I was for trying to follow . I have my own life to lead , I don't need to be around people , who don't even know which way to go . 
Last night , was the worst . Threw up 3 times , felt horrible .. Couldn't really sleep , but feel way better now , just have a little headache .. 
Its raining <3 I love the rain . Still feeling sick but oh well . 
Eating a pop tart , cause I'm scared to eat anything else . My stomach is being a jerk to me >_< 
Sometimes I wish everything was different .. Instead of doing what was plan , or what wasn't .. After thinking about it .. I'm happy for what I done in my past , even if it killed me at the moment .. Stuff happens , I'm over it .. iForgive & try my best to forget . 
; Good Morning Everyone ! Finally going to school . Man I just want to go back to sleep . >.<

I don't think I can ever get to much of this weather . I love it <3 \ 
Having a real nice day . (= 
Took my dog for a walk , now just eating sour gummi worm , and being tired and bored . 
Family is family , i love them , i need them . I don't know where i would be without them . But sometimes , i get confused , if family is what i think it is , why is it , that its the one thing that is making me go insane . ( SuperUpsetRightNow ) But ill get over it .

Gonna wash my doggy then continue cleaning . Lol\ 
Music sounds so good , when its loud .. I wonder if everyone around me can hear it .. haha .

Not even close to finish cleaning my house .. Gonna clean my bathrrom then Going to take a shower , clean my room then play halo reach with my nephew . Then off to bed . 
She doesn't have much , But she gives him every that she does ; real unconditional love . She goes through think & thin for him , helps him and always stayed by his side . But as time went by , He couldn't stand her no more , when all she did was love him . He took a piece of her heart && walked out the door . Leaving her clueless on what to do .. <// 3 
Good Afternoon everyone .!! 
Have one more hour to finish getting ready and make sure everything is clean . \ 
To those who i invited hope to see you guys today for my sisters b-day party <3 <3 
Sister's birthday party came out really good . Yeah disappointed that some people didn't show up . But I guess its whatevers . We still had a good time . <3 <3 <3 
Good Morning . Going to church with the family (= 
Having a real great weekend . <3 
So much is on my mind , can't even think straight . This rain is the only thing that's making my night . 
Going for a walk . 
There's a time and place for everything , what has happened will only make me stronger . And show me what is and what isn't real . With the help of my lord , i know I can get through this , without looking back . <// 3 
Feeling sick .. But whatever . Weeks going good , i guess . 
I love this rain <3 I know a lot of people don't , cause they can't go out . But I don't care , to me , its gorgeous ! The sound of it , is beautiful as well . Well I only came on to check some things . So GoodNight Everyone ! 
As much as I love the rain , the one thing I don't like about it . is how unsafe it is . So to everyone who is driving or going anywhere , hope you are all safe , and drive careful . BTW Good Morning . 
Omgoodness !! I thought things would get better , our family should love each other not start drama . It is what it is , I don't know how I can trust them again , I do one mistake and they turn everything on me . Heh , hate to say this , but my family not all of it , they know who they are can't be trust , or turned to . <// 3 
Goodnight / Good Morning . 
Dreaming was something I always look forward too . Where things were great , and go how I wanted . Now even though I'm going through difficult stuff everyday , I actually look forward to waking up . ?

Good Morning Everyone( = 
When I tired getting close to you , you pushed me away . Now that I'm walking away , I'm the bad person . :/ 
Love isn't something you can just find , it takes time . My heart has been through a lot pain and happiness . I know theres that right person , and before I get to him ; I'll date a lot of mistakes .. So I'll just keep my guard up , and forget that fake love you told me you had for me . 
I can't sleep once again . Damn I hate this . 
I hate hurting people , I don't mean too , I guess I focus why to much on making sure that I don't get hurt . That I hurts others . I'm sorry ! :/ Ughh I have a killer headache .. Oh & Good Morning Everyone . </3

Good Morning Everyone . || I really need to stop putting myself in this situation , its like I'm in repeat , I don't seem to realize til after I'm already attached that I'm heading for the wrong direction .

Things will always look and go the wrong way , til you change up your direction , and fix up your view point . Stay positive , keep your head . * Goodnight & Sweet dreams * 
Being who you are , and not caring what other people think , is what makes you unique . Not someone who tries to fit in , and follows someone who is lost themselves . Lead your own direction , only you know where you want go . Following someone will just make you head in a dead end . 
I can't sleep . :/ 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s house just chilling . :) Gonna go walking , & Zoraya better show up .. ;)

-What is life without love ? We learn to love , and get hurt . We go through things that break us , and things that build us up . Life is not easy , we make the wrong decisions , and expect things to turn out perfect . We say that we hate this world , then why not try to change who we are , and make this world a better place <3

-Your going to get hurt , and way more than once . Rather then falling back to the same situation , why don't you learn a thing or two about your mistakes , and move forward . You can't blame the other person ; they didn't force you to like/love them . 
-Break their heart , They break someone else's . Love them , treat them right ; you'll never have to worry about them breaking your heart ... _idkk I'm tired and just out of it . Goodnight </3 _
