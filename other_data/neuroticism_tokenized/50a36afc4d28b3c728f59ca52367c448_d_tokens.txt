Dear Homework , Please understand that it's not that I don't want to spend time with you , but I think we should see other people . lol 
1\ 
of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is \ 
instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , \ 
andso much else all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens \ 
are going to commit suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell \ 
them life will get better and you respect them , for who they are , copy \ 
and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see who will ? 
She bade him to not , step on her pumpkin ... or some shit like that 
Maybe if I read my incredibly boring book I can go to sleep without thinking about Paranormal Activity . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone \ 
( or are related to someone)who has been eaten by a dragon . Dragons are \ 
nearly unstoppable . They breathe fire and give birth to little dragons . \ 
93% of people won't copy and paste this because their fingers have been \ 
eaten by dragons . The ...... other 7% are sitting in the shower armed \ 
with fire extinguishers . Will YOU make a difference ? 
Colds suck ..

I think this person in MLIA might be right :\ 
\ 
Today , I had an epiphany . Some claim that < PROPMALE > is a ninja due to his ability to hide . I would like to make the point that he could also be a pirate because of his striped shirt . I think < PROPMALE > might be the missing link between pirate and ninja . MLIA 
Rachel : Boo is gonna buy up a bunch of orbs with all my coins !! I feel like he's buying drugs ... 
Dear Facebook world , what < PROPFEMALE > Lanning posted earlier is false . I wouldn't kill a baby lizard . I was just messing with her by saying I would step on a plastic lizard I found without telling her it was plastic first . 
Hacked 
Why am I awake right now ???
