If you had your life again\ 
Would you live it the same ? \ 
Tell me what would remain ? \ 
And what would you change ? 
I always knew I'd never reach perfection , \ 
and if I ever did then I wasn't trying hard enough . \ 
Because there is always something more to reach for . \ 
This path we choose is not the easiest to walk upon\ 
And knowing that I am more eager to continue on\ 
because I know that when I reach the end\ 
I'll be better than before\
