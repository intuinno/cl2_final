I need to get outta Milwaukee ... bah ... why am I stuck here ? 

Feelin ' stubborn as hell . But how's that different from any other day ? 
reaching the sky is never easy when the world's on your shoulders 
lying on the floor is never as fun as lying in the snow 
getting old ... -- ; 
hmmm .... somehow I have been denied access to things about myself on facebook ... I am super confused . 
is feeling accomplished and pleased ! 1 song down and working on 2 more ! 
When life gives you what you want instead of what you need ... you began to see that they are indeed beasts of different burdens .... -- 
Dying is hardly a cure for your life's problems ... 
Happy Year of the Rabbit , my fellow 87ers !

I can show you THE WORLD ; and my < PROPMALE > of Rights ; Freedom Fries ; lemon tree shining shimmering UNITED STATES of AWESOME . 
The elusive orange chao is still very much elusive ... 
Maybe you suck ... just a thought 
Is it just me ... or does anyone else find Easter Bunnies ( like the ones in the malls ) terrifying ... <.< >.> Man , I hate them . 
Love , I love you and I can't really say much more ... and for the sake of being annoying I will say it a million times more ... cause love when I go , I need for you to need doubt this ... So , Love , I love you and I really can't say much more .... 
SHANTY COLLECTORS UNITE ... in the form of GERMANY AND < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
Did you know that apparently < PROPFEMALE > and Poland were original ( on the Hetalia webbie ) listed as neither male or female ... -.- really , dude , really !

Going to bed ... we old people need our rest , I suppose ! 
Up ... do not want ... groceries needed ... tired still ... going 
It sounds like magic ... =.= 
tired but too tired to sleep ... thought I'd sleep well because of an early start ... but my pattern is all messed up ... =.=

I am home . I'd like to say safe but ... my uroboros is lonely and sounds kinda hungry . I , personally , am not scared ... but I am here with two other people . Yeah , ~ rubs uroboros ~ you will eat well tonight ! 
So ... I had this talk with Wesker after dinner , and we decided ... UROBOROS FOR ALL ! Yeah , not just the regular one either ... but RUSSIAN and CHINESE UROBOROS . That'll show you to mess with us ! 
LISTEN UP ... CALLING RUSSIA , GERMANY , AND < PROPFEMALE > !!! IN DECEMBER , THERE IS THE MOST AWESOME OF AWESOME EVENTS IN MISSOURI ... IT'S CALLED BISHIE CON ! GO FORTH AND LOOK AT THE < PROPFEMALE > !!!!

working this into overtime , aru ... I hate when I create new patterns and they don't work right away , aru ... >.< Now , this will be the 4th attempt , aru ! ~ sigh ~ Aru ! 
I am a Seven . You're a seven ? Why , yes , I am . But , you look a little bigger than a seven ... < PROPFEMALE > , I am not talking size ! ~ Any questions ? 
As if a drought wasn't bad enough ... now it's an earthquake ... =.= ... I hurt . I feel ... damaged . T^T 
When will the world come to realize that everybody has the right to love who they will . When will people stop stoning each other for the love they share . 
Things never come easy . Phase 2 can't even start yet <.< * sigh * 
This and that ... that and this . Trying to keep up with everything and finish what I have started . Times are rough ... but this you knew . I never wanted to let go of something so right , but it seems to keep my sanity , I may have to give up a lot to finish what I started ... 
WOOOO ~ !!! YAY , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
A few words too many in my head ... 
I < PROPFIRST > an epic picture of Vampire ! Germania ! Man , I love him more than I love Germany . But of course , it's on paper . > x < 
Too hurt and sick to care ... >.> 
A cup of coffee and a good book ... ah , I love rainy days ! 
I am up and so is the sun . > x < Bright ! 
> x < 
We hate so fast and love too slow ... 
This glass heart shatters ... but no one is around to hear its fall ... 
Sleep finds me easily this night . Resisting its pull , I smile at the world . Good night all . I hope that your dreams are sweet and kind to you . 
New Pictures up in Our shop ~ Rainbow Ribbon Parade ~ We do take orders ! There is an email address ! Check us out !!! 
It's 5:06 ... and I am awake ... > 3 < 
It's gotta be this day , yeah ? Happy May ! 
What do you know of choices ? What do you know of moral values ? You live in a box and do as you are told . You are little more than animal . You sit in your expensive suit and deny me my rights . No , I was wrong , you are not even animal ... 
>.> * deep breath in * <.< It just is what it is 
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're like it's better than yours . Damn right , it's better than yours . I could teach you but I'd have to cut your throat with my big ass sword ... 
I know it's been a while ... I'm sorry I kept you waiting ... 
Nothing impressed me ... I never expected it to 
Rise and rise again ... until lambs become lions (( Man , I am stoked to see < PROPFIRST > Hood )) 
We trample happiness searching for luck 
Big , fanged , carnivorous bunnies that'll eat your eyeballs if you're not paying attention 
Anyone who knows me knows that I love rain . Today , however , it seems to serve as a reminder of how unhappy I am . This unhappiness and sheer lonliness permeates my very being . 
It's all over but the crying . Fade to black , I'm sick of trying . I can't look back , I can't leave behind ... where did it go all the light that we had ? 
Goodnight , Facebook ! Thank you , < PROPMALE > ! I'm gone for the night !!! Need me ? Text me ! ~ poof ~ * disappears in a cloud of SSA glitter ~ 
Up in the air as to what to do . I don't need undue stress ... I'd just as soon say goodbye to all of it . =.= 
Ahhh ... nothing better than feeling better . Thank you for all of you who cared ! I <3 you guys for helping me !!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

The cards are down ... and it seems that , yet again , I am one card short . But this is the hand that was dealt . 
Rise and rise again ... until lambs become lions ! On my way to see < PROPFIRST > Hood !!!! 
Epic movie last night ! I could have done with out certain parts ... but , epic none the less . Expecting today to be epic too ! ~ shakes fist ~ Be EPIC !!!! [ >]^[< ] 
OH HOLY WHAT NOT AND ANOTHER ... I was looking at old pictures . >.> Good times ... yeah ... good times indeed .

It's a beautiful day to wake up ... Liberation Day ! 
Yar har diddly < PROPFIRST > ... 
* sigh * I really wanted to beat you up ! 
Taking a short break ... this book is intense . 
Sometimes life deals you a sour hand ... and it's up to you to find something sweet . 
Life's a little sad when you start to acknowledge limits ... 
Sometimes once the ball starts rolling ... it's hard to stop it ... and other times , I don't want to stop it ... what happens happens . * ready * 
Hopefully sleep will < PROPMALE > me the peace that being awake cannot . 
I swear to bob ... somedays ... just fucking a ... 
pridefest ! I am looking forward 2 the stress relief . -smile- 
I will be up and getting ready for Pridefest in t-minus 5 hours and 43 minutes ... but I can't sleep . > A < Yup , I will be up at 7:30 am , willingly . 
Going to Pridefest !!! Leaving soon !!! Leaving and having fun !!! 
Aiyah ! The chicago boi toyz ! -loves-

Ich kann nicht schlafen\ 
Mein Kopf ist so randvoll < PROPMALE > dir\ 
Kein Mond für uns\

Und du träumst neben mir 
\Sometimes ... I want to rip out your throat \"" 
Bullet finished ... now what ? 
Sometimes the sky cries for those who can not cry themselves ... and on days like today , I thank the sky . 
This day was better than the last . And tomorrow will be better still . ~ smile ~ 
If one is happy with what they have , who are you to say otherwise ? 
THE FRENCH-CHINESE ARE AFTER HAWAII !!!! 
Face it , babe . We're outta luck . Air's running out . I can't keep holding my breathe . That's for sure . Time's up and thank you for this . 
I wonder if I sigh one more time , if I'll be able to draw anothe breathe in ... 
Tired of these emo thoughts ! I am done with this shit . Fuck off ! 
Yarnfalls ... I'm making them ! 
sleep now ... mindless packing later ... night ... sweet dreams , yeah . 
I'm up the sun is shining and I , for once , am not sad about being here by myself . 
Happy father's day to all the father's that decided to be there for their children . 
Going out and I swear to bob ... I will have fun . * shakes fist * 
Okay ... outing cancelled . Bah ! >.> Well , I will find something else to do ! <.< 
Played in the rain with < PROPFEMALE > and Ludwig . 
Power's out . Thunder scared me . -frowns- 
Working on a new yarnfall . -excited- 
Window replacements sounds like people are trying to break in ... Loudly ! 
Woo ... woke up and the power's on ! 
to cut my hair or not to cut my hair ? 
The big move is in less than 24 hours . 
Moving sucks so much ! -cries- 
-sigh- tired & mah bones ache . Can't wait to rest . 
Happy Canada Day ! 
About to leave this place for the last time ... it's a bit nostalgic really . >.> 
AH ... I remember now why this area annoyed me so ... idiots and there bass ... I hate people sometimes . 
Outside . Sunlight . Puppies . Good company .

Germany V.S Spain . I dunno who to cheer on ! * sad*\ 
\ 
But ... I know that I will cheer on the Netherlands ! ^^ 
Can't begin to tell you how sick I am of this ' heat wave'! WHERE IS MY RAIN ??? 
Sometimes , I hate you more than anything ever . Sweet lips full of promises , hiding that mouthful of poison . I drank you down so completely that the withdrawls haven't started . I hate you with all that I am . I hate you so much that I love you . 
Goodnight people . I am off . My muse is calling me . ~ bows ~ 
~ sniff sniff ~ Germany ... Doitsu ... was eliminated ... by Epana ... to take THIRD !!! \ 
If Germany had have made the Finals , I would have been pleased . But now ... it's the Netherlands v . Espana . > T T.T T 
can you see me ? what am I to you ? 
Spain vs Netherlands on Sunday @ 1 ! 
Please do not trample on happiness trying to find luck . 
Wooo -runs around room- Spain won !!! 
Got my hair cut ! Awesome ! 
116 minutes of AWESOME !!!! 
Life gives you what you need but just not the way you expect it . Keep your head up ! 
We complain about not getting what we want , but we don't want what we have . 
RAIN !!! YAY !!! 
While I totally <3 the rain ... I could do without the thunder and tornado warnings , K'thx . 
: monotone : Hello . I am the mayor of Apathytown . I could answer your questions , but I just don't care and I know that as residents neither do you . That is all . : walks away : 
@ the gym with < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPFEMALE > , we here at Apathytown congradulate you on your steps forward . Thank you . 
Decisions decisions ... what am I to do ? No matter what I have to stand by myself . >.> I'd say I hate you , but here at Apathytown , emotions are a no-go . It's a sure fire way of staying out of the frying pan and out of the fire . 
So go ahead and run ... This string that ties us will stretch ... and the color will fade ... but it will lead you back to me ... 
Totes , Go Poland ! 
Hello , I am up before 8 am , voluntarily . World ending ? Flamey rain ? * looks up and stares at the sun * I don't see it . * shrugs * Strange ... maybe it's trying to make me drop my gaurd . * shakes fist at sky and yells * I AM ON TO YOU ! 
Day two of waking up before 8 am ! >.> Strange . * stares at self * Seems like some kind of pattern here ... like internal crop circles . 
Internal crop circles . 
Was in the rain . Felt like a drowned cat . Came out with a Romano curl . Stats : Wet , hungry , crabby . Just like Romano . -3- Where is my Spain ?

Happy Friday the Thirteenth to ya ! We are winding down a lovely day , full of awesomeness like you have never seen ! 
Of Chinese Pirates & < PROPMALE > Mermaids

Maybe you know what I want and I am too stubborn to say anything . Maybe I am reading way too far into this . Either way , I hope that when I do say something it won't be all the wrong things ... or maybe it'll be at the wrong time . 
* Cue dramatic music * * Add fire * * Dim Lights * * Insert epic vacuuming * FUCK YOU ANTS ! YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE ! 
It's too much effort to tell you to fuck off ... 
Things are exactly what I thought they would be , and that is why I will continue to stay guarded . So back up and get outta my way ! 
So you think you know what the hell I am about . You look at me and instantly know who I am . I'm calling your bullshit and you can step the fuck off . 
Hey , love . I just thought that I would let you know that I saw you and it didn't faze me that I had moved on . The sight of you didn't take my breath away like it had . Just thought I should let you know , love . 
Today , I woke up feeling great . I took a breath and got up and realized that there is no reason that I should just lay around . I started my day with one thought , ' I am awesome ! More so than yesterday!' And you know what ... I am still awesome ~ 
Yo ! I know who I am and what I am ! Do you ? Are you sure ? 
I am up ... still ... didn't go to sleep ... thinkin that today is gonna be a sleepless day . Maybe you guys should pray for the unfortunate souls that cross my path this day ! 
When did we start saying that we wanted to look like someone else ? When did we stop thinking of ourselves as good enough ? When did we turn ourselves in to self loathing hate mongers ? I don't think I recognize you anymore ~ So says Lilith to me and now me to you .

One day has begun but the other hasn't ended yet ... 
The image is cracked but so is the view 
I'm up ... dunno about at ' em just yet ... but I am working on that ! 
it drives me harder than anything i have ever experienced . this simple pleasure . this love you give so readily . it drives me to be better than before . for you . i will drive myself towards complete happiness ... 
This is the face I make , when I am fed up with your bullshit . And trust me ... I am passed fed up and on to a blissful rage , my friend . Do not fuck with that line . You are dangerously close , I am warning you ! 
Zen recovered ! Ah ~ what a difference a henna treatment and a good shampoo makes ! 
mushroom burgers [( made of portabella , shitake , and oyster)with arugula , spinach , red onion , roasted garlic , and tomato-basil goat cheese ] are the most delicious frou frou I have eaten . Made of pure win ! 
i'm tired stupid people fighting all hours of the night ... >.< finally going to sleep ... maybe they will keep quiet .. Night ! 
this is going to be a long week ................. >.<

Hello , perhaps I have missed something important . You seem miserable and I seem not to be there or here . I see exactly what needs to be seen and for that I am happy but for you , us ( or neither now it seems ) I feel miserable . Loyalty , apparently isn't a concern anymore . I hate you for it . And when all the chips are down , I thank you for it . 
Oi ! < PROPMALE > ! I dunno whether to be happy for you or extremely sad for your life . 
Man ... coming up with a new name to fit is hard ... Luckily , I have narrowed it down to an Italian name ... but I have picked 15 names that I like . =.= Most of them sound so narcissistic ... Lol ! ~ Help ? 
soulless automatons ... ' nuff said 
Shaking off the last of this ... whose to say that I gotta smile to be happy ... but baby , I sure ain't gotta frown to be through with this ... so I'm leaving you where you belong ... in the gutter ... 
<3 Maybe fear isn't your problem ... maybe hate is ... but if you are content with being a hater ... please don't let me dip in your haterade ... I hope it's bitter and delicious <3 
kicking it up a notch and dropping the line ... undoing these locks and pitching the key ... hell , even you can smile once in a while

Face it ! You're two cards short of ever touching me and a hundred years to early of ever being this awesome ! 
Today ... I'd like to say thank you . To my REAL friends ! The ones who stuck by me and never talked shit behind my back . To the ones who listened to my rants and knew the difference between bitching and whining . To the ones who understood when I was hurt and helped me . 
After much bloody complaining ... NANO , YOU ARE DEFEATED ! 54,261 / 50,000 \ 
and I am not even half way done with the story ... TT^TT 
I am under the impression that I may actually live inside the Shadow Nexus ... 
Being in love was like < PROPFEMALE > : you knew it was there , and no doubt it was very interesting , and some people went there , but I never would . I'd spend all my life without ever going to < PROPFEMALE > , but it wouldn't matter , because there was all the rest of the world to visit . 
Share with me the secrets that you're wrapped in ... cause it's cold inside ... 
Um .. hi . I know we haven't said much to each other in a while . Well ... I am not one for tears and awkward glances .. so hi is enough for now . 
so the first snow ... well , < PROPMALE > snow ... >.< PORQUE ? \ 
Yes , you are beautiful ... and yes , you are magnificent ... but ... but ... I don't wanna have to freeze when I leave the house . 
SNOW !... COLD !... fire ?...

Are you sure I'm a tiger ? I don't feel very much like a tiger . Maybe , I'm vicious ass koala bear ... didja ever investigate that ? 
You were merely confused because I hit you with a table

Dear Electricity , \ 
I wish you would just stay on . I am not sure if you know this but you are making it hard to watch stuff with your constant flickering . And as much as I don't mind sitting in the dark , I do mind having my shows interrupted because you can't seem to stay on ! So please , of you don't mind , just stay on . \ 
Always , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
> In full pirate gear < * glomps you * CONSIDER YOURSELF PILLAGED ! * grins * 
GODS ! Just ... stop ... just stop now ... 
At the doctor's office ! WHY ! 
Smiling too hard ... sometimes happiness sneaks up on me ... never a bad thing ... I wish happiness was like air ... always around ... but I can not complain , I will take what I can get ... And I hope you , too , can also get some happiness . <3 
We aren't retreating ... we are just advancing in the opposite direction . 
Oh right arrow key , what woes and sorrow you cast to thee , first popped off , and now nearly broken ... I think , my computer is falling apart ... TT^TT

Anyways ... it's 11 days in ... do you remember your first words of this year ? 
My wisdom teeth are trying to kill me ... I am going to work whether my teeth like it or not ... I just wish all four would give me a break ! TT^TT

about 3 hrs today and then I get to get my check and YAY ! ~ 
I have a feeling that today is gonna be interesting . We shall see ... 
if i could , i would move the fuck out permanently . end of story . 
Please , help me make it through this day intact ... 
Halt dich an mir fest , wenn dein Leben dich zerreißt . \ 
Halt dich an mir fest , wenn du nicht mehr weiter weißt . \ 
Ich kann dich verstehn . \ 
Halt dich an mir fest , weil das alles ist was bleibt .
