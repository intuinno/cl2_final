They're gonna clean up your looks , With all the lies in the books , To make a citizen out of you , Because they sleep with a gun , And keep an eye on you , son , So they can watch all the things you do . Because the drugs never work , They're gonna give you a smirk , ' Cause they got methods of keeping you clean , They're gonna rip up your heads , Your aspirations to shreds , Another cog in the murder machine . 
Im so bored ! Text me ! :3
