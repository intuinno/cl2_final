Facebook . I finally had to get an account . 

Saw this on a T-shirt : Fluorine Uranium Carbon Potassium 
Freezing bleach tonight . Reacting liquid chlorine with liquid propane tomorrow . 
The silver acetylide experiment was a mild success . It didn't all go off at once , but some of the larger crystals made bangs at the upper bound of comfortable for the ears . 
200M GET ! 
Hawaii kids : Gasp ! I read a manga . The teacher who I play go with bought a Hikaru no Go and convinced me to read it . Is it just my haole side , or do a lot of the males look female ? 
I just beat Super < PROPFIRST > 64 . It's so obvious that Nintendo put a lot of effort into that game . It's really one that deserves great respect . 
The second silver acetylide experiment ( about two grains of sand ) definitely made my ears ring . It's going to be deadly loud when I set off the bulk of it . 
Just detonated 0.8 grams of silver acetylide : Ag2C2 -> 2Ag + 2C . It was amazingly loud and filled the top of my stairwell with carbon smoke . 
I just reacted my calcium nitrate from yesterday ( which has a horrible , gooey consistency ) with sulfuric acid to form nitric acid and a calcium sulfate precipitate . ( This is all theoretically true , but only half true in practice . ) I then dropped a copper wire in , and it started producing toxic nitrogen dioxide . Successful experiment ! It's will be hard to scale it up to things like nitrocellulose production , though . 
Oh crap , I found another kid who does insane chemistry experiments on the weekend . That , and he has pounds of saltpeter , sulfur and sodium chlorate . 
Potential college essay : If I was able to have tea with anyone , my first pick would of course be Socrates . After this , I would have to pick Arjun Murthy . Arjun Murthy 
Those are , without a doubt , the best elements . 
Synthesized manganese heptoxide . Reacted it with ethanol . Formed some ozone , some diethyl ether and some acetaldehyde . It smelled like a sweet , pungent fruit . Also attempted the nitration of cellulose to form nitrocellulose . I'll find out if that worked some time next week when what was , and still looks like , cotton balls are dry . 
Filmed the entire synthesis of nitrogen triiodide with < PROPMALE > Lowe . We'll upload the video sometime today or tomorrow . The bang was very loud and we forgot to wear earplugs . . . . There's a bunch more videos , but this was the coolest . 
Goes on Wikipedia . Sees main < PROPFEMALE > . Freaks out . Realizes that it's April Fool's day . Smiles . 
My schedule does not allow me to take Ethics over the summer . So , taking Christianity in Film with Lilley ; good idea or bad idea ? 
Chemistry with < PROPMALE > Lowe was MEGA-fail today . ( My right eyeball smells like bromine . ) Occasionally , it needs to be mega-fail in order to appreciate the mega-wins . 
is the only male , heterosexual knitter you will ever know . 
9.3 gram silver acetylide explosion followed by a twenty gram flash powder explosion . That's enough for a pyro after the AP Chemistry exam . 
Our chemistry videos are up to 2000 views . By the time I start applying to college , that might have reached a nice statistic . 
The Quiz Bowl team qualified for finals at our competition in New Orleans . \

We walked down Bourbon street and had po ' boys for dinner . 
56-year-old < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , who wrote for the 1980s cartoon series Thundercats , was officially announced murdered . He'd been missing for nearly two weeks , and police reportedly found his arm inside of his abandoned < PROPFIRST > . . . . \ 
Snarf ? 
We made a three stage pyrotechnic fountain today . It was like the fountains that you can buy for new years or the fourth of July , but instead of shooting up sparks , it belched gigantic ( Thirty inch diameter perhaps ) , sparky fireballs . It was pretty cool . 
When I die , I want to be cremated and my ashes used as the charcoal component for some gunpowder . 
Christianity and Film is over ! Let the real Summer begin . 
Bromo name , symbols , < PROPFIRST > 35 halogen elements , components and mercury , but many people , because at room temperature , cesium and rubidium , < PROPFEMALE > , close to Gallagher and swimming . Corrosive and toxic bromine gas . Opium in 2007 , approximately 556 000 tons . brominated flame retardants and fine material was used primarily ants delay . 
Put together :\ 
~ 1.3 grams silver acetylide\ 
~ 32 grams perchlorate/Al/S flash powder\ 
18 grams ETNAl ( Erythritol tetranitrate with a small percentage of aluminium ( one gram ) . )\ 
1 kilogram of ANFO ( That's a lot . )\ 
It left a crater more than a meter in diameter and almost as deep . < PROPMALE > Lowe , we are officially master pyros . 
If you translate the first sentence in the Declaration of Independence through all of the languages Google Translate knows , you get :\ 
The violence is mentioned in the Torah of God and human nature , and the relationship between national and political independence 
It's fun to watch a computer slowly degrade in operation from water damage . It's not as entertaining once it has become an expensive brick and you're computerless . 
My schedule ( finally finalized ): \ 
1 . AP Language\ 
2 . Honors Spanish IV\ 
3-4 . AP Biology\ 
5 . AP US\ 
6 . AP Economics\ 
7 . AP Statistics 
Tonight I fulfilled my holy duty to once again read outside of a dance . The only thing missing was < PROPFEMALE > Watling , < PROPFIRST > Main , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and the rest of the SCCC . I miss you guys . 
spent six hours synthesizing chloroform today . Now I have a nice clear bottle of fine chloroform . . . . Yay ? 
The tertiary trial possesses a propensity to conclude fortuitously ! \ 
In other words , I now have my driver's license . If only I had somewhere to drive with it . 
So , I bowled a new high of 212 today . \ 
You should have seen the Ms. Pac-Man game afterwards . I had to walk away with two lives left because it took too long for me to lose . 
So , today was a pretty awesome birthday ; I received :\ 
1 . Money\ 
2 . A one pound bag of urea prills\ 
Perfect ! 
If you're not in my AP Stats class , you are eligible to be a part of my survey :\ 
How many first cousins do you have ? \ 
Thanks for your response . 
Youtube disabled my nitroglycerin synthesis video before I had a < PROPMALE > to even post it here . I'm looking into the appeals process now . 
I appealed the deletion of our video with a five-hundred word essay this morning . This was too long to fit into their text box , so I hosted it on my personal server at savitz.org/youtube2.txt and sent a link . This afternoon , I got an email saying that my appeal has been denied . I went to my server's access log file and find , surprise , no one except for myself ever attempted to load the document . \ 
Fuck you , Youtube . 
Kind of Bloop 
\The Shadow over Innsmouth\ " Summarized Version :\ 
OVER THE LINE !!! < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Schaffer , < PROPMALE > Cook , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > 
Reaction Factory , < PROPMALE > Lowe's and my Youtube chemistry channel , has reached 20,000 views on the same day that we got our 300th subscriber ! \ 
< PROPMALE > , it's time to start planning out a Sub4Science video . We can post it when we reach 25,000 views . 
Isn't it nice how the new version of Ubuntu is released and suddenly all those hardware compatibility issues you had disappear ? 
So , before I upgraded my OS , I went through my computer to see what I needed to back up . Guess who fucked up and deleted their critical review ? 
I love the sound of hard drives spinning down just before I go to bed . \ 
Also , Group Sushi , I'm a lucky bastard , not a lazy bastard . 
In the end , I guess it turns out that sanity is Hitler . 
I saw The Wall live with < PROPMALE > Waters . It was pretty damn amazing , but under the circumstances , the message seemed somewhat hypocritical . 
Damn Wal-mart wouldn't let my buy a quart of acetone and 1.5 quarts of canola oil because I'm seventeen . Maybe they were afraid that I'd mix them together and chug it . 
So , I now have a bottle with a pound of pure , dry chloroform in my room . Is this more cool , or more creepy ? 
< PROPFIRST > Main , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Watling , I am likely coming to Hawaii over the winter break between December 23rd and January 1st . I officially call an SIC meeting ! 
Remember this :\

Made a < PROPFEMALE > amount of yellowcake uranium with < PROPMALE > Lowe today ! More to come in the future . 
I'm in Hawai`i ! 
So , I was listening to the Super < PROPFIRST > 64 soundtrack , and then the haunted house theme came on ... FLASHBACKS ! Fucking piano ... fucking carousel . I find that level incredibly scary for a < PROPFIRST > game ...
