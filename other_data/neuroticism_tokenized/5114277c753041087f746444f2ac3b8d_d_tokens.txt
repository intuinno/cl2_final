Happy New Year to one and all . My all your resolutions be revolutions . Not the kind that go round and round , but the straight forward kind . 

Watched bachelorette last night : < PROPMALE > man walking . 
Still in awe of my email from J . R . Moehringer . He is just the best writer ever . 
Where is this Our lady of the woods chapel ? That is wonderful . 
Took the Jewish vocabulary quiz . Guess I knew more than i thought . 
Lost so many family and friends this past year to heart disease that I am seriously considering becoming a vegetarian like my husband . When I gave up smoking I turned to wine . When I gave up alcohol I turned to computer games with a fury . What substitute is there for red meat ? MMMmmmmm . If you see a line outside my door you will know . 
Thinking about Sotomayor . Think she will be one of Obama's better \ideas . \ " Her brother is a pediatric allergist in Syracuse . " 
Just read Widipedia's bio of Little < PROPFIRST > . Looks like he helped write it . Incredibly detailed . One of my favorite TV movies , The Little < PROPFIRST > Story garnered an < PROPFEMALE > for the actor who portrayed him . I didn't know that but can believe it . 
Made the perfect NY York cheesecake for my daughter's dinner party . Hit the box I was carrying it in on the door as I was leaving the house and the whole thing went flying . Ended up with plan B : went to P & C and picked up a couple of desserts . 
Made wild salmon in vermouth and < PROPFEMALE > last night . total cook time with prep : 18 minutes . Will try to post the recipe . Will also try to find and post my : so delicious you will want to eat it off the floor cheesecake recipe . 
Kennedy funeral was amazing . High point was the Ave < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . Also the first son's speech was touching . That OLPH Basilica is so gorgeous . 
Well just heard that < PROPFEMALE > Degeners is replacing < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > in A . Idol as a judge . This should be interesting . At least we won't have to listen to < PROPFEMALE > trying to sound intellectual , stuttering and stammering and taking 10 minutes to say what she could have said in 2 minutes or less . 
spooked out over the < PROPFIRST > Carradine interview before his death . He believed there was a ghost in his closet and that it was his wife/s former husband . Found his tie in there with a \grateful dead\ " logo . Spooky . " 
I once heard that it is a good idea to google yourself once in awhile . So I did and found that on Sept . 7 , 2008 I made the Washington Post for my suggestion as to where the best place to watch the shuttle launches is in Florida ( for free ) . 
I am a grandmother once again . This is #10 . < PROPFEMALE > Marie-Therese < PROPFEMALE > was 7 lbs 12 oz . and born at 2:01 . And the < PROPFEMALE > genes prevailed once again , she is another redhead . This makes #4 redhead in our family . What happened to all those Indian and Italian ancestors ? :) She was born on the other grandmother's birthday who appropriately is also a redhead . < PROPFEMALE > genes once again . 
< PROPFIRST > is also a friend of Charlise < PROPMALE > . People get us confused . Just knock his socks off with Buon Compleano . 
To those who know my husaband's family , today is < PROPMALE>'s birthday . 
Looking at the pictures of Avila College 50 years ago , I even found myself in their photos .. I am in the picture of the tbc sanitorium . My class celebrated their 50 year reunion this past weekend at homecoming . 
I just heard that Obama won the Powerball Lottery and the Heisman Trophy . :) ;) 
Waiting to see if the launch of the rocket Ares will go off today . Awsome . Bigger than a shuttle this one . 
Everyone wish < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Powers my daughter a Happy Birthday . How old are you < PROPFEMALE > , anyway ? 
Had 5 hours of dental work done in two days . I now have a frozen jaw with my mouth permanently in the open position . Worse things I can imagine . :) I think after 4 crowns my dentist is taking a round the world cruise and my teeth now look like I am no longer a Central Park bum . 
Launch tonight at midnight from NASA . I will be out on the boardwalk watching . 
Well the launch was scrubbed last night and so was my midnight rendevous on the boardwalk . We do love the space coast . Stayed in with a fantastic memoir . Not as mesmerizing as JR Moehringer's The Tender Bar but I am really enjoying it just the same . All you \foodies\ " will love \ " Under The Table\ " by < PROPFEMALE > Darling . \ " saucy tales from culinary school . Great read . " 
Launch of the Atlantis yesterday . Went off beautifully in spite of clouds . 
Been trying to write my memoirs . Never knew how hard writing is until I tried it myself . Decided on a name for my biography -------- Going Vogue . Isn't that too precious ? < PROPFEMALE > Palin would be so jealous . 
Christmas cards are on my mind . I love the Christmas mail . Sending out a family picture card this year . Never did that before . Most of my over 100 card list are done . Good thing I don't send to \locals \"-------- only out of towners . This is what you get when you live a good long life -------- a Christmas card list that gets out of control because you don't want to lose your friends . :) " 
Just befriended two cousins from my Italian side of the family . One is from my < PROPFEMALE>'s village and Italy and the other is from New Zealand . Thank you Facebook . Cannot believe this . My < PROPFEMALE > Nelli must be smiling down . 
Stress test today . Very sophisticated with treadmill , isotopes and EKG and sonogram . I think that is what you call it -------- of the heart . Took 3 hours and looks like I will live another year . 
At last ------ (Etta < PROPFIRST > anyone ? ) a conservative mouthpeice I can respect . < PROPFIRST > Krauthammer . And am I ever \in like . \ " Comparing him with the likes of Rush Limbaugh is like comparing The 21 Club with McDonald's . He is an Harvard/McGill MD and handicapped but uses none of that to gain attention . He is the most low keyed of the panel on Fox's Special Report . He only relies on his brains . " 
I attrack the weird and the wonderful like a magnet . At a dinner recently , someone I never met before sat down and told me her life story in 5 minutes or less . Jesus help me , but where on my forehead is written : SEX THERAPIST . 5 cents or a lemonade . 
Well I just discovered that J . R . Moeringer ( The Tender Bar ) wrote the new < PROPFIRST > Agassi memoir . So now that is a must read on my list of books . J . R . Moehringer rocks . 
For anyone on your list suffering Holiday depression I highly recommend giving them a copy of : The Tender Bar by J . R . Moheringer . They will laugh so hard they will knock over their pills and booze . Just a suggestion . Great , great book . 
Watched Krumper < PROPMALE > Ferguson from Boston win So You Think You Can Dance last night . Awsome . Unbelievably neutered performance by < PROPFIRST > Lambert \What Do You Want From Me . \ " Do you think he was delivering a message ? " 
Never fail to watch The Sound of Music and not think of my husband's brother commenting that Captain VonTrapp was exactly like my husband < PROPMALE > . Wow that wedding dress is really stunning . I never noticed before just how stunning that dress is . 
Happy New Year to one and all . 
It is in the 50s now here in < PROPFEMALE > Florida . Citrus crop in danger . Right now I wouldn't be surprised if it snows . That is what I get for leaving Syracuse . 
Well I am now down to 62 friends and I think I figured out which two bowed out . Oh dear . Sometimes life is like that . 
I don't know how to tell my \frineds \"-------- downloads are not fun if you get a virus . ( I am talking about computers here . :) And these emails ------ many of which I try to take off on my cellphone with the 100 previous recipients and all their emails listed there . Did anyone ever hear of cut and paste or drag and drop . I am not talking kindergarten here . " 
Just watched a movie from the 90s with Keanu Reeves : A Walk In The Clouds . Great movie . Highly recommend it . A lot of Napa Sonama Valley wine culture in there post WWII . Just wonderful . 
Made chili con carne last night . Yes it is that kind of weather in Florida right now . 
The Russian contingent down here is very funny . Forty degree weather and they go to work in long black overcoats looking like KGB and then when they get back to their codos you see them stroll out in barefeet and bathing suits and a single bath towel and hop into the hot tub like it is 90 degrees here , which it isn't . 
Got the H1N1 flu shot today . Highly recommend it . 
Got tickets to South Pacific . The broadway musical right here in beautiful Florida . Can't wait . I think I have seen the movie 10 times at least . Just like Sound of Music and My Fair Lady and Gone With the Wind and Doctor Zhivago , it never gets old to me . 
I did the Macarena with my mobile phone in an elevator because the voices told me tol 
I hope all you Bostonians are getting out there and voting this week , especially the independents . Our whole country is counting on you . 
Vote Massachusetts . VOTE VOTE VOTE . All you independents get out the vote . This is one amazing election . 
Loving The Bachelor this time around . That < PROPMALE > has some depth which most of them don't . 
Volumnteered today on computers . Had a 1st grader show me how to turn on the sound . whoops , maybe I will volunteer with the toddler set . All this after I paid $50 to get fingerprinted so that they can be sure I am safe . Safe but stupid . 
Been reading 2 < PROPFEMALE > Walls books : The < PROPFEMALE > Palace and Half Broke Horses . Good writer . 
Saw South Pacific at the < PROPMALE > Center . Fabulous and so was the < PROPMALE > Center . 
Watched The Bachelor last night . They visited < PROPFEMALE > Inn . Been there , it is in San < PROPFIRST > Obispo . Funky place . Think he is Catholic and think that will affect his final choice . He has let all the most gorgeous women go . Can't quite get a handle on these girls yet . 
Watched American Idol tryouts in < PROPFIRST > . Total riot . Think some peope know they are making fools of themselves and do it for kicks . Looks like a mega talented season though . That < PROPMALE > brother was nice . Looked so sincere . He did not feel comforable laughing at anyone . Sweet kid . 
Everyone should go to HGTV.com and enter daily for their dreamhouse in NM . Love that TV channel . Fun . 
I just tried a website called vpike.com . OMG Unbelievable . 
Love , love , loved the Olympic opening on the snowboard sailing off 100 foot cliffs in the Canadian Rockies . Unbelievable . Looking forward to the skating . 
Loved the Canadian National Anthem < PROPFIRST > by the 16 year old Montreal girl . Gorgeous . They used to stand and sing it before every movie when we lived in Montreal . 
A break in the Florida cold today . 
Well I figured out who the 2cnd person who defriended me is . My paranoia will not permit this without some introspection . Maybe I am too ancient for friendsl Maybe it is a plotl 
I also keep a list of who doesn't send me Christmas cards . ;) 
A joyous Lent to one and all . 
Anyone who likes French food here is a great website given to me by my daughter : mytartellette.com . 
Watched < PROPMALE > Pavelka give Vienna the final < PROPFEMALE > . Lord it is easy to get sucked into that . Actually I think she was a good choice for him and now he is one of the stars on Dancing With The Stars . Brain < PROPFEMALE > anyone ? 
Rocket launch last night . Very gorgeous . 
Watched < PROPFEMALE > Bowersox own American Idol last night . 
American Idol eliminations tonight . Big < PROPFIRST > Lynche owned the guys night last night . I liked Todrick Hall too . Very entertaining and good voice . I thought Big < PROPFIRST > was annoying at first . He has mega confidence but Steph says he is just a happy guy . 
Well I have 70 friends now so if anyone eliminates me again I will know it immediately . Just heard that my friend Carmencita Samuels of Syracuse has passed so I can't stand losing more friends . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > was eliminated on American Idol last night . She shot herself in the foot with a quirky rendition of < PROPFEMALE > Cline's I Fall To Peices . As PC is held in such reverence I am sure she lost votes on that one . 
Beliefnet today has a step by step how-to for lectio < PROPFEMALE > . 
Found a great recipe for brown bread from the Avoca Cafe in Dublin just in time for St. < PROPFIRST>'s day . 
< PROPFEMALE > Magnus nailed it . I don't vote till the end . Yes , I voted for Adma Lambert the last time around . Thought he was a character but talented . 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST > Day . All Italians wear red today . 
Last night on American Idol Crytal Bowersox channeled Janic Joplin with Me and < PROPFIRST > McGhee . Oh my word . Unbeliveable she was SOOOOOooooooooo good . 
Somebody is messing with my list of friends . I am getting very paranoid . Now I have to figure out who it was that dropped me . :) Does anyone care ? 
Intellectual man was dropped somehow from my profile . How did that happen ? If you don't have brains you get them by osmosis . 
There is a 20 million dollar renovation of the beach here underway . The equipment bleep-bleeps all night long . All I have to say is : bleep-bleep . 
A joyous and peaceful Passover and Easter and today Good Friday ------- to one and all . Not to mention Mercy Sunday -- 1st Sunday after Easter . 
Last nightime shuttle launch . Spectacular as always . 
Door open at the condo to let in the ocean breeze . Beach flip flops on the patio , which ought to say to anyone : someone home here . Twice this week two males , not the same person walked in . The first one said : Oh , I saw the door open . The second one backed away with no comment . When does an open door say : carte < PROPFEMALE > open house here ?? Resolution : I will no longer leave my purse on the sofa . 
FL passed a < PROPMALE > to tie teachers salaries and tenure commensurate with student achievment . Lots of luck . Homework is now over the top and nothing left for what used to be called \family time . \""

Prayers for < PROPFEMALE > Sunderland . 
I love the way people disappear from my list of friends and then miraculously reappear .

Reread the Declaration of Independence . A worthy read on this weekend . 
Oh no ! She's disappeared again ! She will show up again . She has her own magic act . 
I should start a zoo , not a farm . I think a zoo . There seem to be plenty of dogs , cats , birds , parrots , centaurs , horses , pigs , cows , ducks , chickens , wolves , wolverines , tigers , and lions and cougars and also turckeys . Did I miss any animals ? 
To all the myriad of good people that the Lord put and kept in my life , thank you all for the birthday greetings . I am grateful after all these years and in some cases after all these generations ( listening < PROPMALE >?) so many of you care enough to stay in touch . 
Team < PROPMALE > .
