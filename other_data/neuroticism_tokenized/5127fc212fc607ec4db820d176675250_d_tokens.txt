just got back from bowling and eating at pizza hut with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > gabby < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! FUN ! FUN ! FUN ! :D 
Still not tired and have to get ready for school in a couple hours ... 
I don't want to live To waste another day Underneath the shadow of mistakes I made Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside I don't want to fall and say I lost it all Cause baby there's a part of me to hit the wall Leaving pieces of me behind And I feel like I'm breaking inside - Shinedown 
Nothing to gain , hollow and alone And the fault is my own , and the fault is my own .... 
finger painting lol fun ! 
BLAHHHH .... that is waht i have to say about emotional complicated realtionships .... NEVER fall in love , its dream but also a nightmare , welllll ...... nite everyone 
i always find a way to ruin something beautiful .... 
a really good day , ahd fun , I actually laughed ( and didn't fake it at all ) life is good , even when the world is bad . 
SOOOOOOOO bored 
AH !!!!!!!!!!! 
One tear in the dropping rain One voice in a sea of pain Could the Maker of the stars Hear the sound of my breaking heart One life is all I am Right now , I can barely stand If You're everything You say You are Would You come close and hold my heart

dang u < PROPFIRST > swift and your power to know exactly how i'm feeling 
in a sad way ... i'm okay not bursting with happinesss , but not overwhelmed with depression ... i guess i'm just happy that i made an important decisioni ... no matter what , nothing would ever compel me to back to you , don't get me wrong i love you more than i did the first day it began , i've just accepeted that we're not meant to be 
and with the flip of the switch .... just the thought of you makes my insides twist and turn :/ feeling sick
