Imagine there's no heaven\ 
It's easy if you try\ 
No hell below us\ 
Above us only sky\ 
Imagine all the people\ 
Living for today ... \ 
\ 
Imagine there's no countries\ 
It isn't hard to do\ 
Nothing to kill or die for\ 
And no religion too\ 
Living life in peace ...

I believe my sins they'll be forgiven\ 
and I believe my choice will save me from this life\ 
please don't question why\ 
my sins they'll be forgotten\ 
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife\ 
I left this way 
I know * exactly * what you mean . Let me tell you why you're here . You're here because you know something . What you know you can't explain , but you feel it . You've felt it your entire life , that there's something wrong with the world . You don't know what it is , but it's there , like a splinter in your mind , driving you mad . It is this feeling that has brought you to me . Do you know what I'm talking about ? 
But we control these machines ; they don't control us . 
If anyone is going to judge someone else they should take the time to look in the mirrior and judge what they see 
I feel One with the Circle of LIFE !! 
Finally , the flesh reflects the madness within . 
“In the end , the love you take is equal to the love you make . ” 
It's your fuckin ' Nightmare ! 
FUckin Bored and Very happy hit me up 
i feel today ... is a good day ... 
AH !!!!! :O 
“All that we are is the result of what we have thought . The mind is everything . What we think we become . ” 
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else ; you are the one who gets burned . 
Gave A sweet ass hobo 3 bucks yesterday :D 
And I just can't keep living this way\ 
So starting today , I'm breaking out of this cage\ 
I'm standing up , I'ma face my demons\ 
I'm manning up , I'ma hold my ground\ 
I've had enough , now I'm so fed up\ 
Time to put my life back together right now ! 
Live like you were dying 
I don't understand why people try and tell u how to live your life . Their arn't the ones who have to live with your choices and ur mistakes . They should just find a mirrior and judge what they see in there and tell that person how to live their life cause that the only one they can change . So don't judge people on what you see on the outside , maybe the guy is a bum but who the hell said your were any better then him ! 
The days are cold livin’ without you\ 
The nights are long , I’m growing older\ 
I miss the days alone , thinkin’ about you\ 
You may be gone , but you’re never over 
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh\ 
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half\ 
Til I snap 
Now you can do this on your own \ 
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\ 
So get on the floor and grab somebody ! \ 
Ain't nothin ' but a White Trash Party ! 
Court Today at 10:30 . 
AWWW saw the prick Cop today !! 
Fuckin Evil box of Devil Kittens !!! 
The truth is you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow . Life is a crazy ride , and nothing is guaranteed 
:D 
P . E . A . C . E <3 
AH !!!!!!!!! LEAVE ME ALONE !!!! >:O 
Sometimes you just gotta let shit go and say to \hell with it\ " and move on " 
OMG downloaded the New A7X album Nightmare !!! ITS FUCKIN AWESOME !!!! 
We don't need no education \ 
We don't need no thought control \ 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom \ 
Teachers leave them kids alone \ 
Hey teacher leave them kids alone \ 
All in all it's just another brick in the wall \ 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall 
Thinkin Today will be an adventure :D 
Well Ima be gone for a week , Text me or message me Peace ! 
Come back to me its almost easy !!! 
I am he as you are he as you are me\ 
And we are all together\ 
See how they run like pigs from a gun see how they fly\ 
I'm crying 
And when the broken hearted people\ 
Living in the world agree\ 
There will be an answer , let it be\ 
For though they may be parted\ 
There is still a < PROPMALE > that they will see\ 
There will be an answer , let it be 
Blackbird singing in the dead of night\ 
Take these broken wings and learn to fly\ 
All your life\ 
You were only waiting for this moment to arise . 
“This is one person , this is another person . This is one person trying to understand another person , even though it doesn’t have enough room to download the other person into its brain . It can’t understand the person even though it tries to , so it ends up overflowing with knowledge and being stupid . ” -the rev

Today i learned that there are kewl cops out there ! And it pays to know em ;) 
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow\ 
Would you feel sorrow or show love\ 
Or would it matter 
<3 Tears of pain , tears of joy\ 
One thing nothing can destroy\ 
Is our pride , deep inside\ 
We are one <3 
Oh yes , the past can hurt . But the way I see it , you can either run from it , or ... learn from it . 
UGH !!!! I lost my Sched !!!

A final song , a last request\ 
A perfect chapter laid to rest\ 
Now and then I try to find a place in my mind\ 
Where you can stay\ 
You can stay awake forever 
Rebel souls \ 
Deserters we've been called \ 
Chose a gun \ 
And threw away the sun \ 
Now these towns they all know our names \ 
The death punch sound is our claim to fame 
I must've struck a chord , with somebody\ 
Up in the office , cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causin ' nuthin ' but problems , and now\ 
They're sayin ' I'm in trouble with the government , I'm lovin ' it 
Too many times\ 
I've been wrong\ 
I guess being right\ 
Takes too long\ 
I'm done waiting\ 
There's nothing left to do\ 
But give all I have to you and\ 
I'd better find your lovin\ 
I'd better find your heart 
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day\ 
You fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way 
' Cause sometimes you feel tired , \ 
feel weak , and when you feel weak , you feel like you wanna just give up . \ 
But you gotta search within you , you gotta find that inner strength\ 
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up\ 
and not be a quitter , no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse . 
Hey you ! out there in the cold \ 
Getting lonely , getting old , can you feel me \ 
Hey you ! Standing in the aisles \ 
With itchy feet and fading smiles , can you feel me \ 
Hey you ! don't help them to bury the light \ 
Don't give in without a fight . 
dont text me i have no phone :( 
got my phone back !! 
Live life , not by how others view you ... but how you view yourseld

put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was \ 
killed in Hogwarts when it was under siege by the Death Eaters during \ 
The Second Wizarding War . The Order brings Unity , but the Death Eaters \ 
continue to < PROPMALE > division and hatred . 57ish citizens died in the \ 
... terrorist attack against Hogwarts . ... 93% of people won't repost this . Repost to show your support of Dumbledore's Army . 
We are still young so lets live life to the fullest . Even if society doesn't accept it . 
Fumbling his confidence \ 
And wondering why the world has passed him by \ 
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments \ 
And failed attempts to fly , fly 
So far away from where you are \ 
These < PROPMALE > have torn us worlds apart \ 
And I miss you , yeah I miss you \ 
And I wish you were here 
Have you ever wondered if your life was heading in the direction it was supossed to ? Or if it was just caught in the wind and its getting blown around and your not really sure where you will end up . Your just living life day by day and facing things as they come . 
Life is a funny thing that likes to mess with you when you least expect it . when you think your going one way it take a turn for the worst , but in that time of darkness there is always a light that pulls you back out of the hole again . R.I.P. The Rev 
People are strange when you're a stranger \ 
Faces look ugly when you're alone \ 
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted \

And I won't think twice\ 
To stick that barrel straight down sancho's throat\ 
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk-ass 
Yesterday , love was such an easy game to play\ 
Now I need a place to hide away\ 
Oh , I believe in yesterday 
In the town where I was born\ 
Lived a man who sailed to sea\ 
And he told us of his life\ 
In the land of submarines 
A living nightmare , asleep but still aware . \ 
The endless torture . \ 
The painless pleasure . \ 
I grasp myself . \ 
Trying to regain control . \ 
I experience and learn . \ 
In another faction of my mind . \ 
So confused . \ 
But everything makes perfect sense . \ 
Can't feel the pain . \ 
Emotional pain's so much deadlier . \ 
Lost , you've just been raped . \ 
Pain . Your friends can't help you . \ 
Why won't they help you ? Another reality 
Today i found out that i have to make a change in my life , and im not sure im ready for it , at least i have my family and my best friend to help me trough it . 
yays Single !!! 
<3 
On\\n 
< PROPFIRST>'s Birthday is today ! :D 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > McNaughton ... look him up 
Yesterday , all my troubles seemed so far away\ 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay\ 
Oh , I believe in yesterday\ 
Suddenly , I'm not half the man I used to be\ 
There's a shadow hanging over me . \ 
Oh , I yesterday came suddenly 
I don't quite know\ 
How to say\ 
How I feel\ 
Those three words\ 
Are said too much\ 
They're not enough
