is slowly breaking to the trend . FML . 

dislikes Vampire Weekend . Except for that one song that keeps getting stuck in her head . Also is considering opening up her facebook . Oh , the horror ! 
thinks it's retarded to refer to oneself in third person all the time . 
thinks she missed something . 
Dude . I guess I'm here now , since I'm moving on from WSU and more than half of you buggers don't have phones , or something-somesuch . What the hell is this facebook and why am I giving into the trend ?! 
I shouldn't put so much stock into shit that really won't matter in the long run . 
My cellphone is lost/dead/maimed/crucified somewhere out there , so don't bother texting me . Trying to get a hold of people is hard ! 
Got my new phone , but I have no contacts anymore . If you still have my number , text me and I'll save you ~ 
One 85 down with heroic gear , one more to go ! Fuu , leveling is so slow when you only have regular flying . 
I've got to start getting to the gym ! New Year's Resolution , here I come ~ ( abiet late ) 
So , Lazy Day Games ( the new < PROPFEMALE > center in Wichita ) calls . Apparently they had seen me at the Halo Reach tourny and want me to work there , going through the WTI console < PROPFEMALE > files , calling my mom just to get my number , then calling me . \

Guess I'm the only gamer female they know that's above a 4 . Lol . 
Man , couldn't go to work today . < PROPFEMALE > was buried in snow . SNOWMOBILE ! 
Trying to give a shit about other games when I really don't . All that's left is Rift ! 
Dance away the hate ! 
Why be sad when things are gonna be okay ? 
Ohoho , last night was a bad idea . <3 
Myan , this too shall pass ~
