First weekend with our new granddaughter - perfect way to start the new year !!!! :) 

Just started a batch of homemade blueberry wine ! It'll be ready just in time for Christmas ! 
Three and a half inches of rain today , and it's still coming down ... 
Watched the Hall-of-Fame game last night ... Cowboys are lookin ' good this season ! 
I've got a great class this year ! Makes all the hard work worth it ! 
Just watched the Christmas Glee episode and cried ... how big a wuss am I ?! 
Spring break !!! Yay !!! Can't decide whether to try to put the house in order or just strike a match to it ...
