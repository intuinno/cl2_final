If you had to hazard a guess well being that it’s a B-day fourth block class Griff , its Mr. Speers What happened ? You sound like you’re in a casino I only care about one thing , it isn’t you However your spiritual presence has been felt We ate dry bread together this is an upsetting conversation Do you feel bad ? – You don’t ... 
So tell me , if during your spring break you'd done nothing but homework , two mystery puzzles , and taken your dad to doctors appointments/ out to eat ( with the exception of helping someone and seeing ONE movie ) , would you feel you've wasted it ? 
Playing KH2 and am loving it . Dreading the reading that I'll have to do later .

Has flash class and is bored crappsless 
has fallen in love with Glee . Damn . Listening to the soundtrack and I can't decide which guy I like best . Will , Finn , Puck , or < PROPFEMALE > . Will = AWESOME singer and dancer but Puck = badass . Finn = kind and caring idiot and < PROPFEMALE > = adorable .... Hm ... Decisions , decisions . Plus , Don't Stand So Close to Me and Dancing with Myself are the best songs ! XD 
Loved that Glee returned but thought it could've been better ... I did see some of that stuff coming and I love Finn even more now . Will however is going down in popularity while < PROPFEMALE > has risen . Also , < PROPFEMALE > is and has been my all-time favorite . LOVED \Gives You Hell\ " and \ " Vouge\ " . Congrats to < PROPFEMALE > who is now engaged ! <3 Can't wait to see more ! XD " 
is depressed . No lie . And having the whole freakin ' Calvacante clan ( who are related to the Sarators and the Torrneddos [ I don't know how to spell Italian names ]) outside my house and sending the daughter off with her prom date isn't really helping matters . This sucks .

Missed Germany so I typed in Hannover on googlemaps and just sat for like 1/2 hour just tracing back where I've gone , the traintracks , and just overall reminiscing ... T T_T T I wanna go back ! 
\Tell me all your thoughts on God ? And tell me am I very far ? \"" 
So I'm wondering , Would anyone , on May 14th ( that is the last day of AP exams , right ? ) , would wanna take the final morning exams , and then hightail it outta the school and go to the beach for a few hours ? Any takers ? It'll be fun ! Or even the weekend after that ! Come on people ! Lets go have a fun time ! 
Oh dear . Today was the last day of my life to get tried as a minor for any illegal action I may have commited ... NO ! OOOO !!! Still so much I have yet to do ! T T_T T Ah well .

Really wishes this damned constant pain would stop , or she could get some organs removed to stop it , OR the doctors figure out WTF is wrong ! 
So this scene is coming to a close and a brand new one is about to unfold . We hold our heads up towards the sky , don't look down and do not cry . This is just the beginning not good-bye . Having said that * clears throat * WE DID IT ! We survived 12+ years the United State's ' exceptional ' education system ! Lets celebrate like kings tomorrow ! 
Feeling better after all that barum but still a bit icky . Hopefully going to Dorney tomorrow and ... ITALY IS A GO ! XD Soooo much better than Morocoo .

Okay so I just have that kind of time on my hands and as it turns out the total number of late days I have is ! * drum roll * 153 ! JESUZ how did I even manage that ?! OO 
Ho-hum . Monotany has never been so boring ... Oh but wait . Boring is only a state of mind which came be changed by finding something to do and/or concentrate on . 
Okay so does anybody watch Huge ? Well if you do , that is what one summer of my life was like . Specifically tonights episode ... My experience WAS tonights episode (<PROPFEMALE>'s bit ) ... I lasted like what ? A week and a half . It was a nightmare specially cause most of the damn girls in my cabin were on maitnence and preppy bits ... 
I just heard this line in a song : I'm the baby merchant ! Tots ' r ' Us ! Yes . He was selling babies . 
Everyday its the same thing . Wake-up , take Dad out to eat , come home , and stay incase he'll need anything . Then anytime I can < PROPFEMALE > out , everyone else is out doing something with everyone or someone else and I'm left to my own devices . The best I freakin ' get is stealing away to see someone for a few minutes on an errand I have to do . Now my weekend is shot and I'm getting depressed again . Brilliant . 
Okay this weekend offically sucks . It was fine , then it all went to shi * , and it was gettting back on track but then nooooo , keep buggering on I told myself , yeah , total load of crap . So my weekend will now be spent watching the entire Avatar : The Last Airbender series by myself . If you're interested call , though I'm not sure I'll pick up . >:( 
Furry walls don't bring me down , Furry walls please stay around , Furry Walls , Furry Walls 
And those of you who doubted me , / Are going down , down , down/ And the record man who never called , / Can you hear what's going on ? 
Went to see Inception today . Good movie ! Bit hard to hear at points , and lacked a bit in the romance section ( for me anyway , some of it was very touching ) , but overall a worthwhile movie to see . 
wishes she could've gone to Warped ! >,< Damn the threat of not getting money , food , shelter , and transportation ! Also going to see Inception today ! ? Shame there is no good fanfiction of it out yet ... T T_T T Its all Arthur/Ariadne ! >:( I wanna see some of my type of ship up there ! 
Inception was better understood the second time around . Great movie . Had an even better time afterwards , sitting outside and getting drenched . Loved < PROPFIRST > Gordon-Levitt so am now watching 3rd Rock from the Sun . < PROPMALE > Hardy is alsso not too hard on the eyes ... Kekeke ! <3

I think I might cry ... T T_T T The Mumford and Sons show has been sold out for a while and now ... DAMN ! I may just have to buy a ticket and get my arse to Heathrow ! < PROPFEMALE > ! Can you spare a room for a night ?! :P 
Crap . I just realized . I'm scared out of my mind . 
Okay , so Stage Beauty is a weird movie . Embarrassing myself by watching . < PROPFEMALE > freakin ' odd to see < PROPFIRST > Crudup acting as a complete transvestite ... Although < PROPMALE > Chaplin shirtless was a plus ... XD 
Went out to Chinatown today with Wang Kiku < PROPFEMALE > Yao ( aka < PROPFEMALE > ) ! Great day ! XD Can't wait to do it again sometime ! Gotta start getting ready for Inochicon too ! 
Went out to look at sofas today for the familiy room . Me ? I like wood , deep , plush sofas with curved arms . Mum ? Likes leather . These two worlds didn't mix well . The verdict ? The one who sits on the sofa most of the time lost and we're gettting a 3 spot leather sofa ... With square , blocky , and pointy arms . Yay ! My back shall forever be in pointy hel . 
I need someone to live in this house besides my mother and sister . Its so depressing in this house ...

I was just sitting here at the computer , right ? and all of a sudden a fly lands on an bowl in front of me , walks around the rim , and SHAT . Honest to god , I've just seen something I never thought I'd ever see . A fly pooing in front of me . God my life is weird . 
Feels like a complete doosh and doesn't even know the half-of-why probably ... 
There's nothing I could say to make you try to feel okay ... 
Had a class with < PROPFIRST > Graves , realized that I might wanna do criminalogy as a back up , and am now sitting in the quad for another hour probably getting sunburn . College so far ? All I can say is : High school never ends !

OKAY ! Camp Rock Overall Assessment : Just another Disney movie . Now , keep in mind : I am in no way bias to or for the < PROPMALE > brothers , so having said that : < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > needed to be less of stoner , < PROPFIRST > needed to keep his hair that long instead of his new cut , Demi needed to just TELL THE FREAKIN ' TRUTH , and < PROPMALE > was perfect . Ah < PROPMALE > . The sensible brother who was hardly there and didn't talk . The best one indeed .

Hand Covers Bruise and In Motion . Not a half bad soundtrack so far ( only 2 songs in ) 
The < PROPMALE>'s Speech was a da*ned good movie . I loved it . It felt like it was over two hours long but it wasn't . Firth and Rush did a brilliant job ! Highly recommended ! Gonna go find the soundtrack in a few minutes ... 
All this snow made me remember last year's Snowpocalpys warning . And I was reading the English AP Quotes ( if anyone wants them comment and I'll upload them ) but :\ 
“The chances of NOT dying in the storm are nonexistent ; the chances of you DYING in this storm are 200% . You’ll die first by cold , and then be brought back , and then die again by your house collapsing on you” Mr. Fazzini on Snowpocalyps 
Is working on this paper . Probably should've done it yesterday , but oh well . Also went to see Amedeus tonight at the Walnut Street Theater ... yeah . Came late , left early . Feel bad that we did but it just didn't hold any interest for me . I'll go and watch the movie instead . 
In the name of all that is good , just , and holy : DON'T LET < PROPFIRST > BLOODY BEIBER BEAT MUMFORD & SONS FOR THE BEST NEW COMMER AWARD . JUST DON'T .

And anyway , it’s like your bank balance , you know - you always have much less than you think . [ ... ] You don't want to find out that the most you could possibly achieve , if you gave it your all , ... would be maybe eating less cheesy snacks . 
When I was a child , I was terrified by this . ( plays The Magic Roundabout ) It was very sinister , wasn't it ? It just went on and on , like < PROPMALE>'s 7th circle of Hell .

( plays discordant music ) I am Zebedee , lord of the woods ! Bow down snail , I have dominion !

Don't you love it when your parents intentionally say something , somewhat nasty in order to get other people to do something and then you get looks from the people who heard it , just because you're acompanying them ?

\Can I Come With You ? \ " \ 
Okay , scratch that last post :\ 
\I Am the Doctor\ " BEST THEME ( I remember) ! "

SOOOO . I am not looking forward to day at all . I feel sick and mum is just freakin ' dallying a-bloody-bout when we were supposed to leave here NOW to get there at 11.30 ! I don't need more futchin ' anxiety than I already have and she is NOT helping ! 
I love the fact , that after 18 ( 19 ) years , mum still doesn't listen to my traffic tingles . So after asking to LEAVE AT 10.30 ( we didn't til 10.45 ) , NOT TAKING THE MONTCO ROUTE THAT I KNOW , and then forgetting the directions . We are now stuck in traffic , on the turnpike , behind an accident , trying to get to a check in at 11.30 that we are probably not getting to . =,= + FML . 
\Are we really aruging ? \ " \ 
The A-Team , Murdock is the freakin ' man . <3 
Is watching the Japanese channel and is amazed that she can read some of what is coming up on the screen and more amazed that she can UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING . Its a shame about the gas , milk , and food . Can't believe how expensive its becoming . Bloody ridiculous . 
Had fun with < PROPMALE > today :) although Netflix totally screwed us over for the Boondock Saints and Firefly ... =3 = 
Feels a lot like < PROPFIRST > Zuckerberg right now . I've got my FU flippy-floppies , am wearing PJ pants , and have my hoodie on ... Now all I really need is a couple billion dollars and I'll be set . 
Mark/Eduardo fanfic at 4:00 am in the morning with a M/E fanmix playing in the background ? Well insomnia , if you insist . ;) And ZENKAIKON WITH Steph Savage tomorrow ! :D Get to see < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > Kiku Honda Zhang too amongst otheres !

Still , it's such a beautiful night 
500 Days of Summer\

OOEH IHEI < PROPMALE > LIKED MY POST . XD I am beyond happy right now ( even if I have been up for almost 24hrs straight [ and even if he liked a crap ton of others too ]) . ;) 
I wanna sleep . Very badly . Japanese is over and now is the time . But my dang sister had to have class and drive me today . =3 = 
Didn't actually sleep . AT ALL yet . And still has her car in the shop , and sounds like < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > from the Simpsons . Can life say : \WHEEE\ " more than that ? " 
so the Party < PROPFIRST > is offically condemed . This is it . Macaroon is going to be no more . I weep . And yay ! I can't really talk anymore ... =.= What a great day 
Okay , finishing an English paper , and listening to \Shark in the Water\ " at 2:18 in the morning . I am okay with this . Not okay that my bowling theory was wrong from earlier but eh 
Oh . My . Bloody . FEATHER-PLUCKING GOD !! So appearently there is something wrong with my transcript isn't good enough or something because I had Norristown send in my HS Transcripts but NO ! I GET THE SAME FOOKIN ' LETTER THAT I GOT FROM MONTCO BEFORE ! 
wants to know RIGHT NOW , why despite having been enrolled in classes at Montco since 2007 , and attending a full semester of classes , and having NAHS send over my transcripts ( AGAIN ) , I STILL CAN'T GET A BLOODY ACCEPTANCE LETTER LIKE ALL THESE HIGHSCHOOL SENIORS ! I THINK I DESERVE A COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE LETTER ! My sister got one from Susquhanna and in the same week my existance manages to be DENIED ... AGAIN . 
PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable , & in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy & paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 2% are awesome & will re-post this . Please share . Knowledge is power ! Rawr 
Happy can't even BEGIN to describe how I feel about today and tonight . 
May or may not have accidentally missed my math class today .... It was worth it ( well as of right now it was ) but when I take the test ?... Yeah , it still was

So raise your glass if you are wrong/ In all the right ways , /All my underdogs , / We will never be never be anything but loud/ And nitty gritty dirty little freaks\ 
Won't you come on and come on and raise your glass , / Just come on and come on and raise your glass\
