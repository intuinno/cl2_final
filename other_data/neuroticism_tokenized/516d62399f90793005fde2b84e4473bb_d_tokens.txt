hello , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
But you know , I've learned something today . You see , the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself . What we think , the external objects we perceive , are all like actors that come on and off stage . But our consciousness , the stage itself , is always present to us . ~ Kyle Broflovski ~
