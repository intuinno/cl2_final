Sometimes you just gotta beat your inner Fat Kid back with a stick . 
* sigh * People ..... need I say more ? 
Dear whomever reads this , \ 
Sorry < PROPFEMALE > couldn't update her status right now , she has been arguing with her Inner Fat Kid . She's currently beating Fatty up with a carrot stick . \ 
On a side note the Reasonable side of < PROPFEMALE > ( the one writing this ) hates the SICKNESS . ( Yes < PROPFEMALE > I know you I think I'm a weirdo for having so many sides lmao ;DD) \ 
Love , \ 
The many sides of < PROPFEMALE > 
Oh yeah School's closed !!! \ 
Are we going to have percussion practice 2nite ? \ 
I don't know but ik going back to bed !!! 
Hey it's your #1 fan again ! hahahaha yea right . \ 
Can you please choose a set temperature ? I mean it seems you dangle the 65 degree wheather in front of us , only to take it away ! Why ?! Why , I ask !! \ 
* sigh * \ 
Well , I'll be complaining to you later , \ 
We all make choices , don't dwell on them just because it wasn't the best . Tell the people you need to that you made the wrong choice , then pick up your life and move on . It's not the end of the world if you made a bad choice , although it might seem so . The sun and the < PROPFEMALE > still rises and sets , people might change but that never will , thus it's not the end of the world . 
\People don't notice whether it's winter or summer when they're happy . \ " \ 
Hiya ! Yeah your storm you decided to wreck upon us all ? Yeah so it blew a freakin branch into my window , making a loud noise . Causing me to jump nearly 3 ft into the air , and out of my bed onto the freaking ground . * sigh * You really do hate me don't you ?! Bleh !! So much for being in a good mood 2morrow ... \
