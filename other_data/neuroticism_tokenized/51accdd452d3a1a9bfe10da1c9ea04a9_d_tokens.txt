Some love is just a lie of the heart The cold remains of what began with a passionate start And they may not want it to end But it will it's just a question of when I've lived long enough to have learned The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned But that won't happen to us Because it's always been a matter of trust - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >

All I really want is some peace < PROPFEMALE > place to find a common groundAnd all I really want is a wavelengthAll I really want is some comfortA way to get my hands untiedAnd all I really want is some justice ... 
Recall the deeds as if they're all someone else's atrocious stories . Now you stand reborn before us all . So glad to see you well And not to pull your halo down around your neck and tug you to the ground , but I'm more than just a little curious how you're plannin ' to go about makin ' your amends .. Your halo slippin ' down . Your halo's slippin ' down to choke you now 
Gah it started as organizing old pictures n then it turned to into a trip down memory < PROPFIRST > :] 
Keep on waggin that tongue baby ur makin me famous ! 
So your scars fade away You soaked up the pain A better person ' cause you lived through those days And now you know what it's like to prove You can overcome anything that gets to you Well it's alright We're sayin ' our goodbyes To the past and everything that ain't right We won't waste another day With all these silly things in our way :] 
Who's to know if your soul will fade at all The one you sold to fool the world You lost your self-esteem along the way Yeah And you should know that the lies won't hide your flaws No sense in hiding all of yours

I've got somethin ' that you all should know :\ 
holy matrimony is not for me , \ 
I'd rather die alone in misery\ 
' Cuz I was always taught that boy meets girl , \ 
fall in love get married and forget the world , \ 
nine months later , sweet baby's on the way . \ 
Isn't that what they used to say ? \ 
with a girl you knew , \ 
and the bonds that we grew , \ 
turned into a ball and chain 
Grammie is gettin her spinal block today i hope it makes her feel better ^_^ 
I finally have internet at my apartment !! WootWoot ! =D

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray And though she feels as if she's in a play She is anyway 
puddi puddi puddi puddi giga puddi ! 
Those pointless equations to which no solution exists are called absurdities .

So this lady walked up to the cash register & asked if a manager was working that she could speak to i said yes mam im the manager how may i help u she got offended & said that she had a serious question . I wasnt sure wat she was talking about until i figured out that she thought i was 16 & lying to her .. she refused to believe im the manager . she said i looked to young ! wtf does that have to do with anything !

Hates it when girls say they want their bf to treat them like a < PROPFEMALE > because they obviously need a history lesson . Back then marriage was even more of a farce especially with the upper crust . Mistresses were the norm and alot of the time lived under the same roof as the couple . In fact the wife sometimes had to take care of the mistress and then accept her husbands bastard children as her own . get over it 
Tolerance and why people lack it . hypocrisy and why people thrive on it ...

Time is not the great teacher . Experience is . A man may live a whole life but if he never leaves his home to experience that life , he dies knowing nothing . A mere child who has suffered and lived can be the wiser of the two .

When the money lost momentum \ 
And the bills were piling high \

You can't predict the end\
