bored out my mind in st. < PROPFIRST > . wishing dreams would come tru ... 
hates when he feels depressed and goes to bed at 7 and wakes up 2 hours later ... 
leaves for glbc monday ! 
hates when who used to be his best friends are now the people that disappoint him the most .. 
hates when someone pities him , ignores him , and puts anybody first before them . and they say that they want to be good friends ! true friends are hard to find these days ... 
is having fun at camp !! and i dont get service so i cant text . ttyl 
camp is awesome !! leaving for sonshine tomorrow !! Gonna be a great weekend 
thinks the past is what makes us who we are . we learn from the bad and continue the good . through god all things are possible .. and through him anything can change . the past is who we used to be . now is who we are . and the future is who we will be . put everything behind u and move on .. the world wont wait for u . 
god can move you in ways unimaginable .. you just need to move the wall in your heart seperating him from you 
went roller blading for 4 < PROPMALE > today ! a little tiring and havent gone rollerblading since middle school .. totally flew in the ditch lol 
had lots of fun chillin with fam at the fair .. took a walk with a < PROPFEMALE > and had a blast !! 
is at home .. bored and wishing he knew the truth .... 
you can do anything through god ... trust in him and see where he takes you 
even though your heart is hidden within , it shows who you truly are . put god in your heart and let him show love through you , onto other people 
life is a dream if you put it all in gods hands . he'll open new doors for you and bring you joy . and put things in your life far greater than you've ever had before .. 
is gonna chill with conner tonight and go hit up the rutebega days . tomorrow after church maybe work in the yard at my gfs house . had a scrimmage today and didnt feel so hot in skill but defintely in temp ! 
going to scout mesabi east tonight ! then face braham tomorrow and see my mom and sister . watch the game next to the best person ever !

Prayer is one of the most powerful things we have , yet few ever use it . pray and you may not get what you asked for , but pray and you will get more than you'll ever need . peace with god . remember , he is not only our savior , but also our deliverer . 
today sucked .. hope tomorrow turns out better

when you lose one close friend , you fall apart , when you lose two close friends , you wonder where do i even start ? To fix it would take an act of heaven , so much for the great year of 2011 .. 
should i have moved to the cities with my mom a couple years ago ? and gone to school there ? i wonder how things would have been different ..
