Spanish paper & comp sci lab all day ... :P 
So if you're from Africa , why are you white ? 
Changing your profile picture to a cartoon isn't going to stop child abuse . Yes , it spreads awareness , which is good , but how many people that changed their picture will actually be active in dealing with stopping child abuse ? Maybe a few ... If you really want to help , volunteer at a local shelter or organization that deals hands on with these issues to make sure you make a real difference , and not a superficial one . 
guess my engagement still isn't good enough for acknowledgment ... that's okay , it's only been what , over 5 months I've waited ? Like it even surprises me at this point ...
