Public speaking and Chem lab ... monday classes are going to be a hoot ! Time for the dining hall ... let's check out what my parents are paying their hard-earned dollars for . 

Half of my heart is back in Bethpage . 
I know i just posted a status moments ago . But i just have to share this moment with the facebook world . Just got into my dorm . Pants are soaked . ( mind you if i had my boots would not be ) ... cold ... tired ... hungry . So i opened a good ol can of classic chicken noodle ... slapped some CRUNCHY peanut butter on some bread ... and man did it lift my spirits ! 
Knowledge acquired from the evening ... Walmart in Cookeville Tennessee is sold out of umbrellas . Ranch Baked Potatoes at Backyard Burger on campus are well worth the walk at 9 oclock at night . It also only rains in this city when all us poor college students have to go to class .... it especially rains more on those less fortunate whose rainboots don't arrive till next tuesday . 
Arrival at library 7:59 p.m. Departure from library . 11 : 07 p.m. No matter what grade i make on my organic chemistry midterm tomorrow . I will sleep well tonight knowing my determination will well exceed what ever the outcome ... :) wish me luck . Cam ... sweet dreams angel . < PROPFEMALE > Rutherford .... your gaaayy . :) 
is wishing she wasn't going to be an hour away from her loverboy on his Big 18 ! HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAMDON < PROPFIRST > GREEN ! Love you Angel . 
Sticks & Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me . Who came up with that may i ask ? 
Linker come home . 
Lovely Evening thanks to Mr. Camdon Green <3 . Sherlock Holmes was neat ... < PROPFEMALE > McAdams kicks butt ... I envy her charisma as well as her mad skills to beat up bad guys lookin tough as nails without even messing up her hair . You Go Girl ! Amazing night ! I was way past due for a romantic evening with cam . Sweetdreams . 
Dearest Crimson Tide , \ 
Great start for 2011 ! \ 
Thanks ! <3 
My cousin < PROPFEMALE>'s about to have surgery on her spine for her scoliosis . Keepin her in my prayers today ! Stay tough girly ! 
I've gotten two compliments throughout the day of me being a beast at dodgeball this morning in P . T .... ha i love it ! 
Snowball fight ... snowman slaughter ... and a breath of fresh air . What a night <3 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is writing this . :) 
I watched the proverbial sunrise coming up over the Pacific and , You might think I'm losing my mind , But i will shy away from the specifics ... 
My endeavors of the past 12 hours : Rocket town . The Industry . Talking to strangers in Nashville to find jumper cables . They now have Naked Juice at Swoops at TTU ! Their label reads : When it comes to juice , we understand your need to get Naked . Many smiles ... 
Long < PROPFIRST > s are named after a boxer named < PROPFIRST > Sullivan who were a simliar kind of under garment in the ring . In that day it was referred to as his Union Suit . I have the pleasure of wearing these this evening to perform a hasty ambush out in the freezing cold ! I have also come to the conclusion that not even a < PROPFEMALE > secret model could look at all sexy walking down the runway in this \union suit \"." 
Thursday night ... PT test at 0600 .... history ... by 2:21 p.m. < PROPFEMALE > Macon's Spring Break Begins !! PCB ... ah I can't wait . 
You know those smells that are just so distinct ... like say , popcorn . I believe frootloops is one of those smells as well . 
Home Sweet Home ... ( crawford 141 ) . I have realized home is no longer Mutton Hollow Hill Rd in Bethpage Tn ... that is a scary conclusion to come to . As well as i have mixed emotions of what to DO ! I'm no longer in PCB with sunshine and FUN . Back to reality ... time to study and 0600 pt . speechless . 
Week in PCB . Paintball & obstacle course for ROTC . Zach showing me and chels a knew ab work out called \the Crucifix\ " last night at the fit . Completely surviving off NyQuil/Dayquil . Worst I have felt since car accident in 2007 . My only < PROPFEMALE > is to be naked ... curled up in a bean bag ... eating cheese puffs ... & watching judge < PROPFEMALE > . sigh . That was for you daddyo . I miss you ! " 
( continuted from previous status ) & of course to < PROPMALE > White , as well . 
Ran to Walmart for hot fries , batteries , & Vicks tissues ! I love college ! 
* Give your immortality to me ; I'll set you up against the stars . * 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > laughs like Spongebob during awkard moments . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is a deep person & Nate Reisinger ? is ( awesome ) because he tells people to always Dream Big ! It is a sensational thing to think about the people that come in & out of your life . 
You have to try this icecream , it's purple ... ( model walk ) 
You're all that I hoped to find , In every single way , & everything i would give is everything you couldn't take . Cause nothing feels like home , you're a thousand < PROPMALE > away . & the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay ... CAUSE I KNOW I'M GOOD FOR SOMETHING I JUST HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET ! Thanks Mayday ... any takers on what song it is ? <3 
Too proud to breath ... But all to scared to say the things worth saying . 
layin in my cot next to a M16 .... rebecka , what the heck are you doing ? 
fizzl'd fruits skittles holla !! 
I know I'm good for something . I just haven't found it yet . thank you mayday ! 
& up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm Content with loneliness . 
Just choked on a strawberry that I sucked threw a straw in my strawberry limeade from Sonic while driving on the interstate . Curious to know if I wrecked and died if they would have figured it out ... CSI stuff . ( someone might appreciate this post ha ) 
dogs ... cats ... frogs ... mice .. dragonflies ... squirrels ... ducks ... even opossums are safe from < PROPFEMALE > macon out on the road . I will tap my breaks and swerve for just about all of you . But snakes . I'll throw it in REVERSE ! 
continuation to previous status ... if I had 4 wheel drive there would be no survivors . 
April 25th . Killed one snake . Saved one chipmunk . ( sigh of accomplishment ) 
I see that it's good , that it's good to experience the bittersweet to taste defeat then brush my teeth . 
Scars remind us where we've been . They don't have to dictate where we're going . 
Another prom dress in the closet to gather dust . This one looks a little out of place . Gotta tag & no memories . Keeping raining ... I won't feel so silly for being so down . 
Girls want what they can't have . TRUE . <3 
why are pistachios so expensive ? 
Sophomore in college . Success . On my way to the Falls . Get to lay on a rock next to a waterfall with my best friend B.S , tossing pistachios shells in the water . I'm at the end of my rainbow today . I've found fullfillment rather then a pot of gold . 
The brave may not live forever , but the cautious do not live at all . 
Life is not always fair . You can get a splinter , even sliding down a rainbow . <3 
heaven help the fool who did her wrong !! :) 
\I don't believe in guns .... Trust me they are very real . \ " Shemar Moore . You are my hero !! " 
I could really use a wish right now . 
& HE thinks that I'm the one who makes it rain . 
good luck tonight with the tat < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Louden ... loves ! 
If i could write you a song to make you fall in <3 .... \ 
.... Duh Duh Duh DDDESSTTIIINNNNNN tomorrow ! \

He has the best happy father's day comment . You are my hero dad . Forever & always . " 
when it rains it pours . \ 
What are you , two ? \ 
God's spirit touches our spirits & confirms who we really are . \ 
Blessed day ... & then some . 
They had breakfast together But two eggs don't last like the feeling of what he needs . \ 
All Time Low .... HOLLA <3

I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like . You don't get another < PROPMALE > . Life is no nintendo game . Hey um EMINEM , thank you for those little tidbits ! 
What we do for ourselves , dies with us . What we do for others ... 
With all its sham , drudgery , & broken dreams , it is still a beautiful world . <3 
Funny how it rained all day . I didn't think much of it then , but it's starting to all make sense . <3
