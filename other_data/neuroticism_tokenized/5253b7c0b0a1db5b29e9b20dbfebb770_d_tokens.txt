Catching the Brand New show at The Ritz in Ybor on November 5th . So pumped 

My top ten albums I listened to in 2009 are - < PROPFEMALE > by Brand New -Say Anything by Say Anything -Those We Leave Behind by I Am Ghost -Attics to < PROPFEMALE > by Madina Lake -Show and Tell by The Birthday Massacre -The Glass Passenger by < PROPFIRST>'s Mannequin -A Fever You Can't Sweat Out by Panic ! at the Disco -Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge by My Chemical Romance -North by Something Corporate What were your ten albums this year ? 
Check out Madina Lake's ' Attics to < PROPFEMALE>' http://bit.ly/7oxlOr 
I'm going to watch my childhood on DVD now ( aka Cardcaptor Sakura , though it's the Japanese version with English subtitles ) . Ciao ! 
What Is This Feeling ? is a fantastic song . It makes me smile every time I remember the lyrics 
The Flogging < PROPFEMALE > show last night was fun . Sad to say I made < PROPFEMALE > and I leave early though . Stupid laryngitis , giving me ear infections in both ears and a headache . And my spine is stupid too for being out so badly that standing made me want to cry . Accidentally meeting the Architects drummer was a nice consequence of not feeling well though 
I'd like to think I have good luck , but it's usually paired with a nice heaping of bad luck too . That's compensation I guess 
I just punched my computer screen trying to kill a mosquito . Failed . x_O Ow ... 
Going to Moe's around 6:30 . Really craving one of their burritos right now 
Reading the name of a group one of my friends is in just got the Say Anything song Admit It ! stuck in my head and now I can't stop smiling . Love that song 
The library . I approve of it . 
Getting offline now , presumably for the night . Having a mini birthday party tonight , and my guest is almost here . Ciao ! 
Off to eat dinner . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Thank you to everyone that wished me a happy birthday ! <3 
Hey * pokes people on friends list * Like Motion City Soundtrack my Florida buddies ? If you do , you better get your butt to Rockus Maximus on Friday , March 26th . You can win some insanely cool prizes they're providing if you do , but you have to donate money to All Childrens hospital at the show . One dollar donations will count by the way . Follow the link for more info ! http://www.rockusmaximus13.com/MotionCity.html 
I got my copy of My Dinosaur Life in the mail today ! It's quite nifty , and the deluxe version does read like a simple children's book :D It just has a couple of salty words as Motion City Soundtrack like to say sprinkled here and there . I'm looking forward to uploading it onto my computer later 
I am very happy right now . Felt like posting about my amount of pleasedness 
Clash Of The Titans was uber nifty . I approve of the graphics and the amusing prop drop they do in it 
While it's still Sunday , I'd like to wish all of my friends and family a happy Raptor Jesus day :] He went extinct for the dinosaurs sins 
I dislike being jabbed all over my arms with needles . My nurse today was not very good at spotting blood veins 
Farmville is annoying the crud out of me right now . 
D: I missed International Pillow Fight Day . Not cool 
Blah . My stomach hurts . Has ever since I drove around this afternoon . I really need to get used to driving my mom's car 
So confused right now . I'm already receiving two M&G passes to the Motion City Soundtrack show I'm attending next Saturday and then I received an email congratulating me on winning M&G passes to the show for doing something totally different than what I did to receive the other two . I hope I can find out exactly how many M&G passes I'm getting . I'm really confused right now . 
It needs to hurry up and be next Saturday already . Anyone else with me on that ? 
So , I have four meet and greet passes to the Motion City Soundtrack show this weekend . I wonder who < PROPFIRST > is planning on giving my two extra passes to ? 
I think that I'm coming down with something -__-;; Guess that means my back is still going to be out this weekend . I better not be feeling sick this Saturday or I'm going to be so annoyed . 
Less Than Jakes are playing Supercon ?! * did not know this until now * To all of my friends that are going to that , watch their set ! They're great live 
I really need to start writing my synthesis essay on The Great Gatsby soon . Did anyone else enjoy reading that book , or am I a strange individual ? 
Managed to lose my ipod at my dad's house . That's fantastic . Just fantastic . -_____________- Wish me luck finding it . If I don't , have fun mentally picturing me having a massive panic attack 
Note to self : Watch the film \Once \"" 
I wonder where I'll be going to school next year ? Hopefully the school has a choir and a school band or I will NOT be a happy camper . 
Give me paper and give me a pen . I've got so many lines running through my mind right now and I want to write them down just for you . 
To anyone else that is taking this Friday's AP U.S History exam : \ 
Does anyone want to meet up with me at the local library this Thursday for a study group ? 
Taking my AP U.S History test tomorrow . A little nervous , but I did get to study and I did well on the practice test I studied with so I am feeling a bit more confident about this test than I was before . Wish me luck ! 
Found a few old poems I wrote . Awesomeness . \ 
Think I may go watch last week's episode of Glee now . 
I'm just one of those ghost . Traveling endlessly . Don't need no roads . In fact they follow me and we just go in circles . 
I've been told there is a quite a nifty show called Dr. Who that is supposed to come on soon . I believe I will watch it 
\If Gods the game that you're playing\ 
I really hope my mom lets us go back to the apartment tonight . I have homework to do , and the textbook I need to complete the homework with is over there : l\ 
Not to mention I want to do some work on my scrapbook for Acting class and I need the printer over there to do that . 
Wish me luck ! I'm going to try to get tickets to the House of Blues Something Corporate show tomorrow . I have to wait until after school to get them though . I really hope they don't sell out completely before then . Does anyone know of any trustworthy sites that I could buy a ticket off of if they do end up selling out ? 
Congrats to all of the senior Thespians that were awarded their cords at school today ! You all definitely deserve them :] 
I had a dream about the band Cannibal Corpse earlier this afternoon , and then I checked out a book about zombies without making the connection . Anyone , apart from < PROPFIRST > since he pointed out the similarities to me , find that amusing ? 
I bought oil pastels earlier today for the portrait I'm working on . I'm hoping the blending of the colors I'm using will go well . 
red , on the bench 
I'm going to miss all of my senior friends so much when I get to school tomorrow . I love you guys ! <3 
I'm not quite sure why or even how this happened , but I wrote a chorus and a bridge of a song while taking a nap today . I woke up , had the rhythm of it in my head , and the words just came to me . It made me quite happy . \ 
I'm going to work on finishing up the song and adding some guitar and maybe keyboard into it this weekend . 
I need to ask for money for sheet music this Christmas . I need to learn more songs . 
I think my mom wants to show some of my < PROPMALE > work to an < PROPMALE > ist friend of hers . May st < PROPMALE > taking < PROPMALE > classes with the person that trained her friend if her friend likes my < PROPMALE > enough to tell me who trained her . 
I think I'm going to play Mass Effect 2 and I might watch some television . \ 
It's nice to be home again :] 
Help rescue animals hurt by the Gulf oil spill disaster . Play Happy Pets and buy the Peewee Duck and 100% of the net proceeds get donated to the National Wildlife Federation ! http://bit.ly/SaveAnimals2 
I had a horrible nightmare last night . I was at Universal Studios and I was eagerly waiting in line to get into the < PROPMALE > Potter section of the park . \ 
I finally got through the line , and Hogwarts looked beautiful from the outside . Then I walked inside and ... \ 
D: It was a < PROPFIRST>'s Club style warehouse/soup kitchen . \ 
It made me sad . 
Just curious since I've seen two post now mentioning that the USA lost something : Did they lose their World Cup game against England ? I could have sworn that game was going to be going on on the 28th ... 
Considering going to the Social Distortion show on \ 
12th November @ Jannus Landing , St Petersburg , FL , \ 
USA because < PROPFIRST > Turner is one of the opening bands . 
My eyes are burning but I can't keep them closed . Ugh . I really don't like insomnia . 
Well , that's interesting . Apparently Rivers Cuomo , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Shriner of Weezer all attended the college I have on the top of the list of colleges I want to attend . 
Ah heck , why not ? \ 
I might as well do this too . \ 
Like this and I will name one thing I like about you , one thing I \ 
dislike about you , my first impression of you , and a confession . 
Had an urge to write . I am pleased with the results . \ 
Sometimes I really enjoy that my burst of creativity strike me when my insomnia hits . 
Still not tired , but I should probably lay down before the birdies wake up or I'll never get to sleep . Ciao . 
My aunt < PROPFIRST > , the one that feel into a coma , has passed on . May she rest in peace <3 
Got my AP scores in the mail . One was higher than I expected , but the other was lower than I expected . Got 2's on them . \ 
* fails * 
I Am Ghost broke up :[ \ 
I'm glad I got to see them perform live once at least while they were still around .. 
The Warped Tour tickets I thought I wasn't getting : Got em ! :D 
Yesterday was ridiculously awesome . Just felt like mentioning that . Comment on this if you want details . 
Say Anything and Motion City Soundtrack are going on a tour together . You have NO clue how insanely psyched I am for this tour , and I don't even know if I can even attend it yet . 
According to my mom , the person who developed the pictures I took at Warped Tour told my mom the pictures I took were awesome . I really want to know what the pictures I took look like now D: Thank goodness I'll be getting them soon . 
Finished all of my summer assignment for Berger's class with a week to spare ! You have no idea how accomplished I feel right now :D 
To Mr. Wohl : I know you can't read this since you aren't one of my Facebook friends , but I'm so immensely sorry for the fact that my payments for my shirt , shorts , and marching shoes didn't go through . A hotel double charged my parents for a hotel room when they didn't have the money to spare . 
Here's my schedule for the school year . I'm pretty sure I have my math class with < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > at the very least as long as our teacher for the class is the same . I definitely have Choir with < PROPFEMALE > Kempe . \ 
\ 
P1 : Choir\ 
P2 : Prob and Stat\ 
P3 : French 1 ( I already took Spanish 1 and 2 , I'm taking this class for fun)\ 
P4 : AP English Lit . \ 
P5 : Lunch\ 
P6 : Economics Honors\ 
P7 : Instrumental Technique 
Type your name : < PROPFEMALE > Park\ 
Type your name with your nose : < PROPFEMALE > Park\ 
Type your name with your elbow : < PROPFEMALE > Park\ 
Type your name with your eyes shut : < PROPFEMALE > Park\ 
Type your name without touching the keyboard : < PROPFEMALE > Park\ 
see what YOU get\ 
* agrees with < PROPFEMALE > that this isn't hard to do * 
Oh , 2010 , you really are my year ! <3 \ 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > of Schoolyard Heroes are still making music ! They formed another band after Schoolyard Heroes broke up called Blood Cells . Oh , you have no idea how happy learning this has made me ! 
Considering switching into AP Psychology come the first day of school . I did NOT know that was offered as a class . As long as I can get away with taking both Psychology and AP Psychology and I can fit it into my schedule , I want to take that class . 
Got my ACT scores finally . Can anyone link me up to a site that will help me translate my scores to see how well or poorly I may have done in certain sections of the test please ? 
2011's Day of Silence is on April 15th . Anyone want to join me ? :] 
Completed three assignments in each of my online classes . Feel content . \ 
Will most likely do a bit more online classwork tomorrow . 
This Sunday I'm going to an AT&T to get my phone fixed . It isn't receiving text anymore for some reason . It's confusing my mom even as to why my phone isn't working . 
Going to go take a nap . I slept for fourteen hours last night , but I'm still feeling exhausted . Head colds are annoying . 
Less Than < PROPMALE > played a free show in Tampa tonight . I did not know about this free show until 30 minutes after it ended . \ 
Fail to the utmost level on my part . 
Well , I have to \wake up\ " for school in two hours and fifty-six minutes . \ 
I may have strep throat . Going to find out tomorrow morning . 
* loves the new The Birthday Massacre*\ 
You have no idea how nuts it's driving me that \ 
1 ) I can't afford a physical copy of this album until Christmas . \ 
2 ) I can't have my own personal computer play their music at obscene volumes yet because it STILL needs to be set up . \ 
I think YOU should buy The Birthday Massacre's new album so that you can share in my enjoyment of it . 
Why not post this ? I'm interested in seeing what replies I get anyways , so might as well . \ 
HOW DID WE MEET ? ( copy this to your status and see who remembers ) . 
Badly sprained my ankle falling down literally the last two steps of the stairs last night , but luckily I broke no bones . \ 
I can't walk or put pressure on my heel because of it , and I have to wear a brace on my heel so that it will heal slightly quicker than it would otherwise . \ 
I'm more of a klutz than I thought o_o ;; 
Thanks to my friend for sending me MCR . I really like it ! http://apps.facebook.com/gifts-super/717222/home?tv3=mKvXYW0fEOSWwDWCKSrAhyuGk020bxmzbKI%3D 
Nearly done applying for a $ 15,000 scholarship . \ 
I need my parents to double check what I typed down in the sections about them on it , then I'll be able to submit it . \ 
After that , I'm going to work on applying for a $ 3,000 one with my mom since I need her to log into the site the app is on . \ 
Fun stuff . 
I may work on my Stetson application after that . I want to double check with the high school how many club days we now have throughout the year now first though since I'm listing the Gator Writers Guild in my \Things I've done that look fancy on an application\ " section of the application I'm working on now . " 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > for sending me MCR . I really like it ! http://apps.facebook.com/gifts-super/717222/home?tv3=mKvXYW0fEOSWwDWCKSrAhyuGk068bBO9Y6M%3D

Well , I've done my online classwork for the night . Now all I have to do is five simple math problems and I can go to sleep for less than four hours since I also plan on waking up an hour early to shower . \ 
Thank god I'm used to staying awake with just three to four hours of sleep <3 
I'm really going to be ticked off at myself when I wake up at 5am seeing as I've shortened my sleeping time to be less than three hours now . Insomnia is annoying . 
You should go and vote :3 
Grace Thompson is awesome ^_^ 
< PROPFEMALE > Blanco is the best par t-t ime favorite child ever :D 
Special Education children are not sick or gross . They only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education Week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . 
Well , I'm basically done applying for FSU now :] All I have left to do is submit a due dateless Florida residency affidavit and then my application will be completely done . 
Site maintenance is being performed on the Florida Virtual School site . I have to wait an hour to do a single assignment . Fail * didn't get much sleep last night * * is happy she has both soda and an energy drink to reach for if she must to stay awake . 
So , I ended up staying awake seven hours longer than I meant to . I watched < PROPFIRST > Dawson videos during that entire seven hour period . 
I'm going to attempt to sleep now I guess . Wish me luck . My insomnia is \ 
kind of throwing its own little party right now so I don't think I'll be\ 
getting any real shut eye until about 8am or 9am . 
I'll be annoyed if \ 
I'm still awake when my family comes back from the cruise they've been \ 
on . They should be back in about three or four hours to yank me out of \ 
bed . Sleep or no sleep they WILL be yanking me out of my bed when they \ 
get back here . \ 
So ... um ... yeah . G ' night I guess . \ 
* just cut a single message into three separate ones because facebook has a cap on the amount of words you can use in a feed post * 
Just donated 93 pounds worth of things I don't use anymore to Goodwill . 
I'm going to do my homework now . Meh XP * is too tired for this * * will do it anyway * 
I seriously need to get to work on my < PROPFIRST > book for Economics now . I really hate procrastination at times like these . 
I finished putting together my < PROPFIRST > book * is happy * 
I need a nap . I think I'll get one before I write the essay I need to have done by tomorrow . 
You should all wish < PROPFIRST > Somers a happy birthday , because he's an awesome guy :] 
I think I'm going to be making my afternoon walks a daily thing . I quite enjoy them . 
Change your Facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( December 6 ) there should be no human faces on Facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is a campaign for children's rights . End violence against children ! 
So happy right now . Just checked , and currently my GPA is , unweighted , a 3.8 and , weighted a 4.25 . I'm so glad that I've finally been able to surpass my freshman year GPA after the medical situation that occured my sophomore year that affected my grades . 
My pictures from Next Big Thing 10 have been developed . I ended up buying a crummy disposable camera again for this show , but some of the photos still look pretty decent . I'll upload them later . 
Earlier today , my friend < PROPFEMALE > Kempe and I decided that were < PROPFIRST > Iero to be portrayed as an animal , he'd be a butterfly- with rabies . \ 
I think < PROPFEMALE > needs to go check her twitter account . Just sayin ' 
My spine just crackled like a collapsing pile of logs in a winter time fire . Not 100% sure , but I just have this gut feeling it may be annoyed at me about Sunday still . 
So , I did my first performance in front of an audience tonight . Surprisingly enough , it didn't make me the least bit nervous . I had quite a fun time actually . \ 
I may be seeing all of the people I performed for again between some sets at this year's Rockus Maximus shows . Check back here for details on that :] 
This weekend . I have liked it quite a lot :] 
For those unaware of this , < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World is now my favorite movie . \Chicken isn't vegan ?! \"" 
I know why < PROPFIRST > Schwartzman looked semi-familiar when I was watching < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim last night now ! He wasn't the musician I thought that he was while watching the movie , but he was- in the past- Phantom Planet's drummer . 
I've got such the urge right now to watch a < PROPFIRST > Bowie biography . Good thing I have one of those on my DVR :] 
< PROPMALE>'s season finale was amazing tonight . It was very well written and performed . 
Just finished an essay I was given on Friday that I put off until now . I've been doing a decent job of writing papers that my teacher's like at the last minute throughout the majority of this semester , so I hope this isn't the essay that my luck runs out on . 
I feel like I did great on my AP Psych exam today . My AP English exam ... that's a different story . 
Heading to the University of Tampa soon for my best friend's graduation :] 
I just applied online for a job at McDonald's . I'm going to apply for a job at < PROPFEMALE>'s either later on today or tomorrow . 
I'm nearly done apply for the SAT test that'll be going on in February . I'm so nervous that I won't be able to send the colleges I apply to my SAT scores before they decide if they want me to attend their school or not . \ 
Namely UF . 
I've taken the ACT twice , so they ARE going to be sent some of my scores that they require when a student applies , but the SAT apparently fits my learning style far better than the ACT does , so I'm giving it a last minute shot . \ 
Wish me luck . 
I'm planning on applying to all of the colleges I've been wanting to apply to over Christmas break . The majority of the deadlines are February 2nd , so all of them will definitely be sent in before then . 
I'm going to jump offline and study for my economics exam . Ciao ! 
THE ARCHITECTS are going to be the opening band for My Chemical Romance's World Contamination Tour :] < PROPFEMALE > is very , very pleased by this . 
I want to scream ! I just spent TWO HOURS filling out my student resume for UF , and when I went to save , it told my session had timed out . I logged back in , and it saved NOTHING . NOTHING . \ 
* is furious * 
Completed an online class assignment . Planning to take a stab at my UF application student resume again later today . Wish me luck with that bit . 
Also , I felt like sharing that I came across carolers for the first time in my life yesterday . They had lovely voices . \ 
Pretty sure they were caroling for volunteer hours . The group looked like they were teens , and they were singing in a retirement community when I watched them perform . \ 
Still . \ 
Enjoyed it . 
Note to self : Swing dancing in a car causes one's neck to cramp up . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all who are celebrating it ! Happy Saturday to the rest of you :] 
Now really is not the time for me to be watching a Doctor Who marathon , but I am anyways . I really need to kick my procrastination habit in the face before it goes and kicks me in the face . 
I got two really amazing late presents ^.^ I got a signed copy of the new Madina Lake EP , The Dresden Codex , and I got a ticket to a performance that < PROPFIRST > Dawson will be doing in Florida sometime next month . \ 
Super excited . 
Just applied to the CVS my brother works at . He's friends with the managers , so he says he's pretty sure he can get me hired :] \ 
If not , I also turned in four applications to various restaurants today . \ 
Wish me luck getting a job in general ! xD 
Spent eight hours straight watching < PROPFIRST > Dawson videos . \ 
Enjoyed every minute of it too :] 
Holy crud , < PROPFIRST > Way's artwork is lovely ! I thought you'd all like taking a look at it . \ 
lindseyway.com 
Burlesque was a great movie . I'm glad I was able to catch it while it was still in theaters . 
Haven't slept at all . Kept myself nourished throughout the night/morning by eating bananas and drinking Diet Coke . Still not tired . \ 
Yay insomnia . 
Just held up my 2009 yearbook's photo of Mrs. Quave up next to a paused < PROPFIRST > Dawson video that showed a full view of his mother's face . \ 
I just found Mrs. Quave's doppleganger . 
I've convinced my mother that < PROPMALE > Days makes awesome music . She bought The Midi Mafia song \Lucky\ " he's featured in after I had her listen to it . \ 
Just ran by Dunkin Donuts to talk to the hiring manager . He wasn't in today , so I'm going to have to try to talk to him again tomorrow . \ 
If you're wondering , yes , I got up to talk to this hiring manager at 6am . \ 
It feels weird waking up before the sun rises for once . My insomnia is really pulling a number on me right now . \ 
Leaving again at 6:55 am to talk to the hiring manager at CVS . \ 
Wish me luck ! 
One of the highlights of tonight was hearing \Everything Is Alright\ " by Motion City Soundtrack get played over the speaker after YouTour came to an end and singing along to every word of it . \ 
The Dangerous Summer and Big D are both playing Warped ? \ 
So going to try to be there . \ 
First I need to know if that will overlap with my college classes though ... I don't want to buy a ticket and then not be able to go . 
I'm starting to upload my YouTour videos ! 
Finally done uploading all of videos I took at YouTour yesterday onto my Youtube channel . Check em out ! :D If you have an account on youtube , subscribe . I'm planning on posting videos more often than I have in the past . 
Just watched the first two episodes of season four of Doctor Who . Definitely going to be watching the rest of the episodes from that season . 
I'm really liking @Cappex . com right now . Finding a lot of scholarships I can apply for on there . 
Must go to Warped this year . I had heard that The Dangerous Summer and Big D & The Kids Table would be playing it , which is enough to convince me to go in itself , but The Wonder Years are also going to be performing at it . \ 
All three will be performing at all Florida tour dates . \ 
I swear , I will be so ticked if I find out that the St. < PROPMALE > show overlaps with college classes on me . 
Well THAT was a peculiar email . I could have sworn up and down that I didn't finish any of the college applications that I'd started , but it seemed I did finish one . \ 
And I was accepted . \ 
Nifty . \ 
The school's Stetson . \ 
Kinda boosted my morale , so I think I'm going to give applying to UF , UCF , FSU , and USF late a shot . 
Slightly annoyed . \ 
I can't remember my login information for my UF application . \ 
Whatever . \ 
I've already started on a new one . \ 
Annoyed . \ 
I was one essay away from finishing that thing . 
Most likely not going to be attending Stetson . \ 
Wasn't counting on it , so not bothered by that . \ 
The scholarship money they're offering me only covers half of an individual school < PROPFEMALE > there per year . \ 
As of right now I'm sticking with my plan to get an AA at PHCC , and then transferring to a state college . 
Got a package in the mail that made my day . \ 
I really love it when I get replies from people I send letters to :]
