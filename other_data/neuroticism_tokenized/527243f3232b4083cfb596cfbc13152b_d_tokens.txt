I came into the lounge , and now someone is talking at me about the economy in < PROPFEMALE > . This is why I don't go to the lounge .

No phone service in my room ... Which means I didn't receive the call that my food was here , which means I get to sit upstairs for 20 minutes waiting for my dinner and I won't get to eat until like 11 . I'M HUNGRY ! D: 
R.I.P. the cape . :( 
A watched water filter never ... filters . 
THANK FUCKING GOD philosophy midterm has been moved back to Friday .

DRad's singing voice sounds nothing like I thought it would- it's actually good ! 
did they just decide to give the warblers songs that suck for their voices so that they wouldn't win ? I mean , they sound awful !

If I had a nickel for every time I related something's frequency to the number of nickels I had , I'd have exactly one nickel . :D 
This is the worst day I've had in 6 years . 
Thanks to everybody for making this day a little bit easier for me :)

I'm going to be an AUNT !! :D 
Why do I feel like eventually Hulu is not going to be free for anyone anymore ? 
I am so pissed . I just spent 45 minutes on the freaking phone with tech support to fix 2 problems that I've had with my computer since the day I got it . One he couldn't even fix , and the other it took him 45 minutes to fix . This is the third time I have called them , and the first time they've actually helped fix one of these problems . It makes me so angry ; I shouldn't have to deal with this with a brand new computer ! 
Just spent 3 hours at the rainy cold zoo . It was totally worth it :D 
Just went on Skype so that I could play Dungeons and Dragons with people from the engineering frat at GWU . Could I get any nerdier ?! :P

Why is it that whenever I have a sinus infection and go out in public , people treat me like I have leprosy ? WAH I already feel bad enough D: 
About to buy sims medieval . Couldn't resist , especially when I'm stuck in bed and it is an instant download . 
I was so excited that the hour-long downloading process for Sims Medieval had 3 seconds left ... and then I realized I still had to install it D:
