And although there is still no cure for someone who has their head up their ass , we must remain hopeful . PLEASE HELP RAISE AWARENESS !!! As 93% of people won't re-post this . Why ??? Because they have their head stuck up their ass too 
Thinking about the horrible killings in Arizona yesterday . What kind of person kills a little girl , 3 elderly women , not to mention the judge that was killed ? I pray that Giffords pulls through this and that all the other people who were injured survive . I pray that who is responsible for this burns in hell for all of eternity and justice is served ! 
Enjoying the afternoon . Making stuffed peppers for my family . Nice to look out the window at the pretty snow out there . I don't mind the snow on a Sunday ! 
Going out for a girls night out ! 
My computer crashedon Wednesday and it is still out for repair . That means no FB ! What a week ! 
Computer is back up ! 
Packing my son's lunch tonight because he is going to the Metro . of < PROPMALE > Museum in NYC tomorrow . I so envy him and I wish I was going too ! School trip , but I have to work ! This is his last school trip I think because he graduates this year .

Happy Birthday in heaven to my mom . There is nothing in the world like a mom's love . I am so grateful to her for all she did for me , all the love she gave , and knowing that she always had my back . 
Going out to dinner tonight with the family to celebrate my son's 18th birthday . I can't believe the baby of the family is already 18 ! Time has flown by ! 
For the rest of February please change your profile image to your dog , cat or favorite animal . The object ? Not to see a human face on fb until Feb . 28 . This is a campaign to raise awareness against the cruelty of animals . Please copy and paste to your profile < PROPFEMALE > . Thank you ! :) Let's be their voice ! P.S. : Don't be cruel , don't tie your dog outside 24/7 . 
wise old person once said(for all I know it was my friend Penni)There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life 
Upgrade being done today to the computers at work . So while the system is down , I have a great 3 day weekend ! 
I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones who will !! Think of the ones you know or love who has or had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour ? Do it for all . There are too many to mention who have fought and who are fighting .... I hope to see this in the status of all my family and friends
