Im a gonna b inat the river for fireworks ... Anyone care to join me ? 

No matter how hard I try , I remain the world's inside joke . Bored ? Kick Bethea while she's down a few good times . It'll give you a laugh . 
I actualy saw one of those age defining makeup commercials today that said , get this ... \Inner beauty is important . But not nearly as beautiful as outer beauty . \ " OMFG Really ?!? LMAO That's < PROPFEMALE > for ye " 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is phenomanal . My favorite actor at os this moment . Good god . 
Tired of trying ... Tired of fighting .... Tired of having my heart broken . Maybe I will marry for money , and have affairs with hot guys , so that I protect my heart and my sanity . And my dignity . Lord knows being a sniveling mess isn't dignified .... 
Let's see how honest FB friends are ... Leave a ONE WORD comment that you think describes me . It can only be one word . No more . Then copy and paste this on your wall so that I may leave a word about you . This should be interesting :) 
Let's Go Saints , Let's GOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! 
My baby boy is tying his shoes ! I just love milestones :) 
Lying down gently amongst the stars ... Soaring through dimensions parrellal and far , Past the galaxies of colliding fate ... Whisper the rumors of evolution's theories , To blinded generations of the future's collapse ... As if the sky decides to rise tomorrow To breathe , to bleed , to live ... Red and deathly , upon my skin ... I have accepted the tattoos of judgement , Wicked truths of my present state .... 
Spiraled Stellar worlds twist into shades of dementia Echos of what thought once was .... Whirling in spirals of cascading rainbows Shadowed ... feigned safety frrom a casual lie Simply fading reminders of illusions past 
Flippin hot ! Rockin Saints ! 8-0 we could go allll theeee waaayyyy ! 
Who dat think they gonna beat dem saints ? Who Dat ? Who Dat ? We Dat mother F*s !!!

while < PROPFEMALE > benson helps < PROPMALE > him down . you run up from behind & stab the guy who has enough explosives on him to blow up a 1/4 mile . theres something wrong with that lol 
Dreams of some psycho implanting gps trackers in your clothes , & in a pretty cat he sends your way , then stalks you . resulting in him crashing through someone's apt to kill you , but you escaped out the window , stripped naked , put a t shirt on , and hid in a trash can around the corner . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% wont copy and paste this , many because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? LMFAO 
Wooo Hooo ! We are so goin to the Super Bowl ! Yay ! 
It's amazing how you can believe you know someone , only to find that they're not the human being you thought they were . & they call themselves \real\ " What a joke "

We need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want to be accepted & loved . Most of you probably won't copy & paste this . Will you do it & leave on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special < PROPMALE > week-this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding

They say truefriends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up just like they spokeyesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far they live ... REPOST this if you are lucky enough to have at least ...... one friend ... like this .

So .... I just thought I would share the little known fact that it is illegal to consult one attorney in Alabama , while consolting another . ..... so ... it's like this ... Before olne attorney will speak to you about the details of your case , and his capabilities to help you or < PROPMALE > legal advice ... He makes you sign a piece of paper . 
And until you sign another legal piece of paper saying you abolish the agreement for his repesentaion and advice .... no other lawyer can legally discuss your case in any detail that may be constrewed as giving legal advice . F*cked up huh ? 
Oh yeah ... and every attorney advertisement , wether in print or audio or visual ... must state that they are not implying their quality of services are any better than any other attorney you may get . * Fuc*ed again huh ? 
\I saw a transvastite .... and he was wearing a shirt that said guess . \ " LOL Demetri < PROPFIRST > is cool .. "
