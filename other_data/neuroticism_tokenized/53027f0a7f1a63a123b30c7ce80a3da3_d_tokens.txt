i have an important early day at work tomorrow , my eyes are grainy , im deliriously tired , and my brain wont STFU ... somebody sing me a lullaby

zombies already roam the earth ... its an affliction of the mind , not the body living in a dead world seeing with eyes closed*breathing in the poisons that men speak*liberate separate deviate*chaos in my head*you rationalize our slavery succumbing to society*masochistic masses enduring the punishment of freedom*living in a totalitarian tomb*i will not lose my soul i am not like you * 
finally , a day below 80 degrees ... love my sunshine , but a break is nice 
had to take a FB break for a few days ... lots of stuff going on on my end . thank you so much for all the gifts everyone sent me while i was away ... back and ready to play 
there is no better feeling than to be remembered

knew when she woke up at 3:30 pm and all her plans and most of her day off was shot , that the day would be shitty ... but hoped it would get better ... and yet by the end of the day not only is my day shot , but all my plans in life right now just got halted to an abrupt stop and i am not looking forward to this roller coaster ride again . 
says goodnight to this half of a day she had ... tomorrow is another day .
