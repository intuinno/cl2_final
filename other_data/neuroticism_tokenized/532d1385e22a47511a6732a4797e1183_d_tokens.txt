Not my chair , not my problem . 
Please put this on your status if you know , or are related to , someonekilled on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The RebelAlliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy , but the evil Empire ... continues to kill innocent civilians . 93% won't copy/paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
So funny when your exes family members are harassing you ... Pathetic ... I think yes ... 
Ugh the bottom of my foot itches and everytime i go to scratch it , it tickles ... fml !!

I don't feel right ... Not bad ... Just not quite right ... Something's different ... Within the past minute I got this real strange numbing sensation starting from my abdomen and it went up my spine ... Curiouser & curiouser ...

eWhy's my body gotta be breaking down on me ?! My entire body hurts . I've got a fever of a 100.3 ... And I can't sleep ... Someone should take me to repair s

Tonight = finishing my letters to < PROPFIRST > ... Yes i'm mailing them all at once lol 
Really miss my < PROPFIRST > bear ... 
Cant wait to see my love !! 
Within you I lose myself ... \ 
Without you I find myself\ 
Wanting to be lost again . 
“Distance\ 
never seperates two hearts that really care , for our memories span the \ 
< PROPMALE > and in seconds we are there . But whenever I start feeling sad cuz I\ 
miss you I remind myself how lucky I am to have someone so special to \ 
miss . ” 
If the only place where I could see you was in my dreams , I'd sleep forever ... 
All that I am\ 
All that I ever was\ 
Is here in your perfect eyes , they're all I can see ... 
\An eternity is forever 
A\ 
part of you has grown in me . And so you see , it's you and me together \ 
forever and never apart , maybe in distance , but never in heart . 
To love someone is nothing , to be loved by someone is something , but to be loved by the one you love is everything ... 
Sometimes you meet somebody and you know that whatever you did before , it must have been right .... nothing could've been too bad or gone too wrong because it led you to this person . 
I dropped a tear in the ocean , the day you find it will be the day i stop missing you ... 
When distance tends to keep us apart , \ 
Remember I still hold you near \ 
in my heart . \ 
When the night together , can't be ours , \ 
Just close your eyes and meet me in the stars ... 
I may not get to see you as often as I like . I may not get to hold \ 
you in my arms all through the night . But deep in my heart I truly know , \ 
you're the one that I love , and I can't let you go ... 
If you live to be 100 , I hope I live to be 100 minus 1 day , so I never have to live without you ... 
If\ 
love is great , and there are no greater things , then what I feel for \ 
you must be the greatest . 
Goodnight Facebook ... 
Alright mister sandman ... I need sleep and you need to stop being a bitch ... 
If I had to choose between loving you and breathing . \ 
I would use my \ 
last breath to say I LOVE YOU . 
I bid you adieu facebook ... Let's hope I pass my written exam tomorrow ... Oh boy ...! 
We were given : Two hands to hold . To legs to walk . Two eyes to see . Two \ 
ears to listen . But why only one heart ? Because the other was given to \ 
someone else . For us to find . 
Finally out of school for the day . Staying 9 to 930 all week so i can spend time with my love while he's here . Super excited ! 6 MORE DAYS ! 
3 DAYS LEFT !!! 
Hopefully I'll feel better soon ...

Working the < PROPFEMALE > counter in Macys again today . Lets hope it doesn't kill me . Between the Benefit counter and the shoes ... It's torture . 
Turning my phone off for tonight because I don't feel like talking to anyone ... People piss me off . Not in a good mood at all ... \ 
Lets hope tonight my dreams are better than my reality ... 
Lets hope I can still go to Kansas here soon ... 
Shower now and party later ... Someone should be a doll and give me a massage cos I'm super tense and have some hella intense knots in my back , shoulders , and neck 
I'll stick to the original Swedish horror film Let The Right One In . The U.S. remake Let Me In can't top the original . 
Didn't wanna wake up this morning ... So instead of eating breakfast , I'm going to enjoy laying in bed next to my baby girl Bandit . :)

To go out ... or not to go out ... \ 
Go out seems to be winning ... 
Simply Lemonade and Gin ... FTW !! 
I effin love my friends !! \ 
Cici you seriously made my day . 
What to do tonight ... Any ideas ? 
Who's free tonight ? 
Sleep sleep !! 
Could use me some Orange Juice right now ... 
What's going on this weekend ? 
It's so fluffy , I'm gonna die !! 
My hair seriously smells effin ' amazing ... \ 
Nuff said . 
I don't want this week to end ... :( 
Sleep is for the weak ... 
Dreading Saturday morning ... :[ 
Don't want today to end ... \ 
:( 
Hate this feeling ... 
Can't sleep at all ... \ 
Way too ... \ 
\blah\ " \ 
Just talked to my baby . \ 
I miss him like crazy already ... \ 
Can't wait for him to be back in my arms safe and sound . 
Gotta try and get some sleep ... Been a long and upsetting day . 
Another sleepless night ... 
I need a waffle maker so I can make waffles with bacon in em ... 
Is it weird that I'm browsing around online for silly lil things to send in a care package just because I know it'll make him smile ? 
The < PROPMALE > System : A comprehensive Approach to Seduction :\ 
M- Move in\ 
A- After\ 
C- Completion 
Talked to my love ... Hopefully tonight I'll be able to get some sleep . 
Watching It's Always < PROPFEMALE > In Philadelphia . Goodness I love this show . Just wish my babe was here to watch it with me . Soon enough though . 
Resorting to a drug induced sleep . \ 
G'night ... 
BAAAADOOOSHHHH !! 
Why am I up so damn early !? I only just got to sleep ... :[ 
Haven't grown in years ... \ 
I'm going to be short forever ... 
you see , you're the only star\ 
in the film i never made\ 
would you rewind it all the time\ 
rewind it all the time ... 
Sleep , why are you so hard to come by ...? \ 
Ugh I feel like Hell . 
Well you're the guiding light that brightens up the night\ 
And I see your face in my dreams\ 
You're the only < PROPFEMALE > in my blue heaven\ 
And I'm waiting just for you ... 
Ugghhhh I feel gross ... Maybe I'll be able to breathe better with a hot shower ... Yes ... A hot shower sounds delightful right now . 
Blah blah blah .... I need more paints ... 
They say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same , but I don't think it's possible for you to miss me as much as I'm missing you right now . 
And if you never really get me then i guess you'll never know the trainwreck that i am ... 
< PROPFEMALE > .... < PROPFEMALE > .... TODAY < PROPMALE > ! 
& In That Moment I Swear We Were Infinite ... 
Seriously just saw the most adorable picture ever ... too damn cute ... 
story of my life , you’re just another < PROPFEMALE > ... 
it's effin ' cold as balls !! \ 
Someone give me a reason to get out of bed ... 
This weather is perfect for sitting around a fire , or better yet , to cuddle under some warm blankets and watch movies . 
They tell me I must reap just what I have sewn \ 
but darlin ' I hope it's not true\ 
For once I made plans about living alone \ 
but that was before I met you\ 
I thought I was swingin ' the world by the tail , \ 
I thought I could never be blue\ 
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved\ 
But that was before I met you ... 
FLIP FLIP FLIPADELPHIA !! 
Ughhhhhh \ 
SOMEONE COME SAVE ME !! 
I miss my lunch dates with Cici ... Those were the best ... Getting free cookies ... Talking in pseudo < PROPMALE > ... Being fly , like a G6 ... Expressing our likes and dislikes in Spanglish ... Collecting taco < PROPFEMALE > hot sauce packets because we find the phrases on them useful in certain situations ... Especially when you want to get something across to someone ... 
I know I should get dressed but I'm soooo comfortable wrapped up in this new fluffy towel ... 
BRING THE RUCKUS !! 
Fungus Amongus ... 
I don't skinny dip , I chunky dunk ... 
Shower Shower Shower\ 
Then off to babysit Maeva and < PROPMALE > =) 
Have you got a gas mask ? \ 
Is it in good condition ? \ 
Do you < PROPFEMALE > it regularly ? \ 
IF NOT -- WHY NOT ?

Todays challenge ... Keeping the kiddos off the couch ... 
Still love this movie ...

\THOSE COMMIE SONS OF BITCHES ! \ 
WHY CAN'T I FIND MY CORD FOR MY CAMERA !! WTF 
Damn you internet !! POS hasn't been connecting ...

So I just learned I can add people to my Amazon wish list via my navigation tool bar . 
Ughhhhhhhh I want it to be tonight already ... 
“Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid entwined together on a bed of clover and left there to sleep , left there to dream of their happiness . \ " , 2011-02-26 23:11:25 "

12 MORE DAYS !! 
It's a Cat Power kind of night tonight ... 
What we've learned turns to paper . \ 
What we've known is like cigarettes . \ 
Formaldehyde fingers 
I feel the same way about disco as I do about herpes . 
<3 < PROPFIRST > Franco <3 
the land where large , fuzzy dice\ 
still < PROPFEMALE > proudly\ 
like testicles from rear-view mirrors 
“I love you as certain dark things are to be loved , in secret , between the shadow and the soul”\ 
< PROPMALE > Neruda’s Sonnet XVII 
Its 16 < PROPMALE > , to the promised land\ 
and I promise you , I'm doing the best I can ... 
iPod's on shuffle and the song Portions for Foxes comes on ... Damn this brings me back ... 
Indian food then planting flowers with the madre . Good day so far . 
What to do with my hair .... Any ideas ? 
Looking up the bands at SXSW on a day that I for sure cant go , is depressing ... 
teal & electric blue ... I think yes .... 
So let's take a < PROPFEMALE > out\ 
Put it down on a house\ 
In a place we've never lived\ 
in a place that exists\ 
In the pages of scripts and\ 
the songs that they sing\ 
And all the beautiful things\ 
That make you weep but\ 
Don't have to make you weak 
Thank you everyone for all the birthday wishes . \ 
<3 <3 <3 
ATX ... Bright Eyes ... HELL YES !! 
Effin hipsters ... 
Oh eBay .... You will be the end of me ... 
The sinner bows at the feet of the dead\ 
no souls to save\ 
just hope for an early grave 
< PROPMALE > Parrish <3 yummm 
My stomach is trying to tell me to eat by making predator noises ... 
Time to go mimis \ 
90night 
let's be birds of a feather and flock together 
BAAADOOOOOOSHHHH 
Hi Ho Silver , Away !! 
What has no conditions , but one condition ? 
We accept the love we think we deserve ... 
mistakes build character and character takes you places money cant 
When the power of love overcomes the love of power , the world will know peace . 
I think you know what time it is it's time to get ill 
I'm not the problem , you see\ 
It's everyone else that bothers me\ 
They make it so hard to be kind\ 
But when I'm with you I don't seem to mind\ 
So thank you for making me feel ... better 
DIE REPLACEMENT FRIENDS ! 
Sleep , why must you elude me so ...? 
Sleep is for the weak . 
Maybe a hot shower will put me to sleep ... 
Stay out of the tall grass ... 
Chill sesh with mister McComas ... I think yes . 
\She tested very high on the stroke-ability scale ... \"" 
Drug induced sleep + Me = HOPEFULLY the best nights sleep in days ... 
I want the song I can sing forever , \ 
I don't care for structure , \ 
Just to know it's mine . \ 
I'd hate to see , \ 
This thing we've developed , \ 
Become your burden or my waste of time . 
OMFG THIS DOG WON'T STOP BARKING !! 
Can it be 5 o'clock already ?
