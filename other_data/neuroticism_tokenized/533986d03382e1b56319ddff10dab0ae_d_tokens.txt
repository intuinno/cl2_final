Like this status and I'll write 5 things I like about you on your wall 
September is cancer month : In memory of every cancer patient , family member and friend who has lost their battle with cancer and in honour of those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste , I did . Will you ? \ 
<3 
Super < PROPFIRST > fruit snacks are amazing c : 
Boring day , Boring weekend , Just very boring times . 
? Every person has a 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as your status , be the 3 percent and put this as your status , at least for an hour , for those who died because of cancer or those still fighting it ? 
Saw Paranormal Activity 2 tonight . \ 
I jumped , a lot . \ 
< PROPFIRST > laughed at me , a lot . ._. 
It is about 8 at night . \ 
I think I'm gonna clean my room . c : 
PLEASE ... putthis on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) whohas been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and they canbreathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because theyhave already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the ... shower ... armed with fire extinguishers , ... and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this 
Trying to learn Lullaby by The Spill Canvas on my guitar . \ 
Failing miserably . 
IMPORTANT : the whole changing your profile picture to your favorite cartoon character thing was actually created by a group of pedophiles , because if children see pictures of cartoons they will add them , it was currently on the programmer Internet frauds and will apparently be on tv some time tonight , put this as your status to warn people and change your profile pictures back .

Ordered new Nikon D3000 c : 
Ich liebe dich < PROPFIRST > Sawyer , ich vermisse dich . 
New Nikon D3000 camera , new Girl skateboard , almost $200 , new boots , and < PROPFIRST > is coming home today and I get to see him . Good < PROPFIRST > tmas :] 
I need to get out of the house today , sitting at home all day kind of sucks .
