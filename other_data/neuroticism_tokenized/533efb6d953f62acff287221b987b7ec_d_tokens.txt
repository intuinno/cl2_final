Sticks and stones may break my bones , but names will never hurt me . 

absolutly loves the world of < PROPMALE > for various reasons ! 
\You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams . \ " ---- Dr. Seuss ---- " 
<3 
I'm a vampire . Fear my sparkles . 
Your heart may freeze or it can burn . The pain will ease if I can learn there is no future , there is no past . I live this moment as my last . There's only us . There's only this . Forget regret or life is yours to miss . No other road . No other way . No day but today . 
hanging yourself kinda hurts . 
I just want to go home . 
Screw this messed up world of < PROPMALE > high . 
It's not fair how in the books they get these fabulous love- lives and all we get is the horrible truth of real life . 
As many times as I blink , I'll think of you tonight . 
YaY ! sNoW ! 
<3 Je t'aime <3 
SiCk 0_o . 
Live the life you want to live . Be the person you want to remember . Make decisions . Make mistakes . If you fall , at least you tried and I'll be there to catch you . 
If you love Twilight ... you love < PROPMALE > Potter 
The greatest thing you'll ever know is just to love and be loved in return . 
<3 '' ) < PROPFEMALE > Christmas :) ^^) 
I'm Comin ' Home :) 
HAPPY NEW YEAR !!! \\n <3 <*>...<*> <3 
is back from Pittsburgh :'( BUT came home to a WONDERFUL SURPRISE ! :] 
http://ldroppert.edu.glogster.com/humanrights/ You HAVE to watch this video on the glog . The glob was made byu an 8th grade teacher . 
Thank you for being one of my only friends . On top of that , thank you for being one of my true friends . I've really apreciated it over the past couple of weeks through the deep end . I know it will get better abd you'll help me find that shiny , new place we'll call Happiness . That place we've talked about . The one we wish to be our Heaven , though we don't know what lies ahead . 
In fairytales it's always a happy ending , but whatever happened to real life problems like poverty , drugs , anything and everything ? Why did all the endings in movies eventually turn out good ? It doesn't always happen like that . There is always a flaw in the plans , always a little tweaking needing to be done , death is the concequence and sometimes it's fixed before disaster strikes . But not often . 
Today is a winding road . It's taken me to places that I didn't want to go . Today , in the blink of an eye , I'm holding onto something and I do not know why , but I tried . I tried to read between the lines , I tried to look in your eyes . I want a simple explaination of what you're feeling inside . I've gotta find a way out . Maybe there's a way out . 
Finishing off my list . Can't tell you who's on it ;] sorry 
misses her dark hair =[ 
I had the most beautiful dream last night , but the sad part is I can't remember any of it . 
Six Day Weekend ! <3 great time for < PROPFIRST>'s <3 
We're Just Such Hopeless Romantics <3 
<3 Poptarts <3 
I'm almost alive and I need you to try and save me . It's okay that we're dying , but I need to survive tonight , tonight . Secondhand Serenade- Half Alive 
I can't talk to anyone except < PROPFEMALE > ! And she's not on . 
Will you cry with me to make me feel better ? Or will you be the one to make me cry ? Because it looks like you're the reason I'm crying . 
Why do you do this to me ? Why do you do this so easily ? You make it hard to smile because you make it hard to breathe . Why do you do this to me ? 
Loves < PROPFEMALE > Wagner , < PROPFEMALE > Hintenach , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Connors like sisters <3

And The Tears Come Streaming Down Your Face When You Lose Something You Can't Replace . When You Love Someone , But It Goes To Waste . Could It Be Worse ? 
Although random , idiotic , and just plain retarded , I'm gonna say that I'm excited for Disney World :) 
You make me smile like the sun , fall out of bed , sing like a bird , dizzy in my head , spin like a record crazy on a Sunday night . You make me dance like a fool , forget how to breathe , shine like gold , buzz like a < PROPFEMALE > . Just the thought of you can drive me wild . Oh , you make me smile :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Connors and I had the weirdest dreams ever ! lolz 
Goodnight my someone , goodnight my love <3 
This may be a big school , but it's just like a small town . Everything and anything gets out once and its gone forever . Everyone knows by the end of the day and no one forgets . That's how it is here in < PROPFEMALE > West Lawn . That's how it is in < PROPMALE > High :( 
Nobody wants to be the last one there . Everyone wants to feel like someone cares . Someone to love with my life in their hands . There's gotta be somebody for me like that . Nobody wants to go it on their own . Everyone wants to know they're not alone . There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere . There's gotta be somebody for me out there . <3 ~ Nickelback ~ Gotta Be Somebody ~ <3 
is sick and tired of being sick and tired . 
Wow . You don't know how many times I was told by 8th and 9th graders to join select chorus next year . It made me feel special :)
