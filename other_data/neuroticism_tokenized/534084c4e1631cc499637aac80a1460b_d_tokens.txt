Little Miss < PROPFEMALE > got her first tooth today !!!! 
I have pots with no lids and lids with no pots . Whats that about ? 
< PROPFEMALE > and me are covered in cereal but I would say it was a success considering she managed to get at least half into her belly 
My little < PROPFEMALE > ate all her cereal today and tried to eat the bib and burp cloth and bowl and spoon too ! 
So Bored ! 
Lolas got RSV :( 
sigh ... rsv & breathing treatments every 4 hours on top of cutting -another- tooth .... Lola & me need some serious sleep ! 
Taking < PROPFEMALE > back to the Dr. again . Nothing seems to be helping 
wow my house in the middle of a lake today ! 
I love how on school mornings I can't get my kids up for anything and my baby sleeps until 9 . But on the weekends oh .... eveyones up at 6 am . 
Ugh ! Up and can't go back to sleep !?! 
Back from the Dr. and thankful that < PROPFEMALE>'s finally feeling and sounding better .

Felt the baby start moving yeaterday ... so now the fun begins 
My baby turns One in 12 days . I dislike this ! 
Ugh ... nothing sucks more than being sick and still having to take of everybody 
Loved you the minute I heard your heart beat and more by the time you were born , then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old and I knew I would die for you & to this day I still would . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life 
Made two huge pans of mexican chicken for dinner . I'm going to make myself sick :) 
Doing workbooks with the kids to review . < PROPFEMALE > LOVES it .. School is her favorite thing to play , but I'm pretty sure < PROPMALE > is annoyed with me for cutting into what precious time he has left to focus on video games !! 
My dad has a 4 yr old female rottweiler , < PROPFEMALE > who needs a good home . Hes gone back to work & dosn't have time for her . Shes a really good dog . Shes been around my kids her whole life and we've never had any problems with her . Shes very calm . When she was young she got her front leg caught in a hunting trap . She gets around just fine but has a slight limp . It dosn't bother her tho . If anyone is interested let me know . 
Ahh .. Kids are gone for the weekend . A nice break before the school year starts Monday 
I just got up !!! Made french toast and coffee and enjoying my quiet morning all alone . 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > were so excited about starting school this morning so things went smoothly . And < PROPFEMALE > turns one tomorrow . My babies are growing too fast :( 
My baby turns 1 today ! I cant believe how fast this last year went by and how much our lives have changed since she was born . That little girl pulled me through the hardest time of my life . And I couldn't be more blessed that she came along when she did . She makes my heart swell with happiness . Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > !!
