getting sleep the week before finals . Amazing . Well , at least , I plan to get sleep .... in a few minutes ... zzzzz .... 
Trying to slow down , and just breathe .

listening to Italian music while uploading Rockbridge pictures :)

\Be still and know that I am God . \ " \

\Is she pretty ? \ " \ 
fighting the urge to stress .

\But You O Lord are a shield for me 
pulled an I Love < PROPFEMALE > moment today , accidentally set her clock backward instead of forward and almost was late for class . 
tried eating an orange without making a mess . It's about as impossible as petting a squirrel . 
finally worked on chapter 6 (!!) and is starting 7 . 
made it through draft 1 of Chapter 7 !! 
had oral surgery again . 3 stitches and I can half-smile . :/ 
I have many things to thank God for today , and snow is one of them :) 
is in a good mood :) 
could see her breath outside . The weather needs to make up its mind ! 
observed a squirrel yesterday . Watched as it fed itself ( it was quite cute , standing there , nibbling away , looking around cautiously ) then climbed up a tree , jumping from branch to branch , and ( impressively ) from tree to tree . Squirrels are fascinating :) 
is happy . 
ate an orange and didn't pull off the white stuff like usual . Turns out it was quite delicious ! 
is dancing . Enjoying today :) 
had a good day after all .
