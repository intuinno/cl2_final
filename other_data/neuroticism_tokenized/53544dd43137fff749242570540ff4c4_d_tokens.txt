Don't pity the dead . Pity the living , and , above all , those who live without love . 
So I think I may go to the Twilight premiere . Not to watch the movie ( because we all know that a movie based on a book with such little substance isn't going to be very good ) but to dress up , < PROPFEMALE > out with friends , a make fun of all the people in line before bailing .

< PROPFIRST > Pilgram vs . the World was really good ! I really enoyed it ! :D 
To the girl singing in the cafe : the school full of college students ages 20-30 do not appreciate your love of showtunes .... especially when you're singing an EIGHT MINUTE SONG originated by two of Boardway's best singers . 
It's funny how people get so into video games . My little brother is getting so angry because someone keeps killing him in the game ! ROFL !!
