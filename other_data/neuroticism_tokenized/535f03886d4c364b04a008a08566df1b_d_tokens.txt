\Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another 
CNA's are busy caring for your family while missing theirs . They're rarely doing less than 3 tasks at a time . They're given more than they can handle while doing it all with a smile . They love even when their lives are falling apart . It's a thankless job but it makes a world of difference everyday . They're not just patients to us ; they are like family . Re-post if you are a CNA , know one , or appreciate one ...? 
Por favor .... no te olvides de mi . 
got a Droid X :D 
Please pray that I get this job !! 
Got the job !!!! :D
