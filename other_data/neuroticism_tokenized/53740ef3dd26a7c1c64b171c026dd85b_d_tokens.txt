How could you be so heartless ? 

te quiero mucho 
Ignorance is your new best friend 
ready for church my outfit may be stupid or cute ? hmmm 
Your a hot mess and I'm falling for you 
What is love , What is love ... Is it giving up ? cause thats not how you raised me . 
Who's going to the game tonight ? I have a choir song stuck in my head . D: haha 
and now I guess she's on crack ... 
I got the notion through all this commotionthat I was in the wrongthrough trial and error I found myself holding on to the things I hate 
You might deny it , but you're tied to your desiresAnd you're selfishYeah , you're selfish just like everyone elseSo drink up 
You lose your mind if you lose control It makes you feel ashamed for the hearts you stole And now your own heart's scared of an attack ' cause you can't give them back 
You are two kinds of beautiful the typical kind of beautiful and the my kind of beautiful which makes you extra beautiful . 
send me gifts on petville :) 
I am NOT afraid ..... They may want to take Christ out of Christmas , but they can never take Christ out of me . If you are proud to be a Christian and are not ashamed of Christ then post this to your status for 1 day as a light to the world . Most people will be too ashamed or scared to do it . God Bless those of you who can do it . 
Cause every time we touchI get this feelingAnd every time we kissI swear I can fly Can't you feel my heart beat fastI want this to lastI need you by my side 
For a minute there I lost my self , I lost myself . 
Why is there a good amount of people online right now ? no one wakes up this early so what the heck is everyone still doing awake ?

You cant make someone love you with a song

All you are to me is dead 16 bullets split your head all you are to me is dead skin 
No one really wins this time

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair 
so who is going to Warped Tour tomorrow ? 
Let it roll Our time is fleeting so we take control From California to my home sweet home Our day's repeating like it's all we know It's all we know 
Razors pain you , Rivers are damp , Acid stains you , Drugs cause cramps , Guns aren't lawful , Nooses give , Gas smells awful , so you might as well live . 
Warped tour yesterday was pretty much amazing :) \ 
I saw a few friends and met some really chill bands 
I saw so many random people I haven't seen in awhile at Harada , people were confused with my new hair cut . 
UGHHHHHHH YOUUU NEED TO STOP NOW PLEASE !

Taking Back Sunday tonight I hope everything goes as planned 
Everything i learned about breaking hearts i learned from you

Song of the day : wasted - cartel 
But i had a clue wouldnt it be nice to never be alone in this wasted life ? 
topsy turvey dont know which way is up or down tears on the ground 
And i hope this makes you happy now , that the flame we had is burning out and i hope you like your pictures facing down even broken hearts may have their doubts 
I love how I ALWAYS see nsn lyrics on my news feed , the lyrics are so corny :) 
you wouldn't be such a bad person if only you didn't insult and make fun of everyone . Honestly , your smart and your not bad looking now you have to be nice . Its a good thing to learn . 
>.< 
this is the earliest I've ever felt tired . \ 
maybe I'll actually get some sleep tonight . \ 
Or I'll probably still end up staying awake . who knows 
I want grapes 
I'm still lightheaded and dizzy , I just hope I'm better in a few hours so I can go to my best friends show

so now i'm forging ahead past all the plutocrats who sold me out go sob in your bed if life is twice as pretty once you're dead then send me a card I'm still the optimist , though it is hard when all you want to be is in a dream 
why are people still online ? why are you guys still awake ? 
It's 92 degrees inside my house ! D: 
I know you know everything , and I know you didn't mean it . \ 
drop everything , start it all over , and remember more than you'd like to forget . 
I think I'm going to make breakfast ... or not whatever happens once I get downstairs 
5 days till my birthday

my throat hurts like crazy but I kind of like the way I sound so I'm just sitting in my room singing . I'm totally going to ruin my voice 
song of the day : Existentialism On Prom Night - Straylight Run 
Falling asleep , asleep at the wheel As I approach that < PROPMALE > I'm starting to feel If you can wake me up , with only a touch If I can die with you , life would be enough

we don't know so we wait for tomorrow we don't know so we only go forward 
completely obsessing over < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > since I saw them the other day , Hopefully its not the same thing that happened after I saw say anything . They were all I could listen to for over a month . 
You can sound the alarm , you can call out your guards You can fence in your yard , you can pull all the cards But I won't back down 
You could do better You could do better You could be the greatest man in the world You can do better , better than that You're a fraud 
Do you know how long I've waited To look up from below ? Just to find someone like you , And will your love light burn me baby , Burn a hole right through my heart I think I might just trust you maybe But I'm not sure 
my weekend = cleaning 
seriously is everyone and their mother watching titanic right now ? 
Fall is here , hear the yell Back to school , ring the < PROPFEMALE > Brand new shoes , walking blues Climb the fence , books and pens I can tell that we're going to be friends I can tell that we're going to be friends

\Love is a luxury\ " 
Theres a hole In my heart which you used to get your air It wont beat again for at least another year You cut it out yourself , so you wont suffocate in there Your < PROPFEMALE > is losing to your fear 
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun 
I never wanted the stars -- never shot for the < PROPFEMALE > . I like them right where they are ; all I ever wanted was you 
Came as a gift from a good friend That dissaproves ( but understands ) To represent and actively encourage all of my worst habitsThey all are proof that we are both capable Of the most terrible things Don't test me 
When amidst all the madness , I saw a flower . 
I'm such an instigator bahah 
\I'm dating a 4 year old ! \ " - Trianna Kennedy " 
if Trianna Kennedy falls asleep while I'm on the phone with her friends I'm going to punch her . 
I just want to run to you And break off the chains , and throw them away I just want to be so much And shake off the dust that turned me to rust Sooner than later , I'll need a saviour . 
If you're an ocean Then I wanna jump right in If you're a hand grenade Then I'll pull the pin I'll wait right here , all night for you To let me in and I'll run , Run right back to you , I'll run 
\Your stomachs in nuts\ " - Trianna Kennedy " 
Trianna Kennedy keeps kissing and licking my arm its kinda HAWKWARD ! 
Oh , I can see now that all of these clouds Are following me in my desperate endeavor To find my whoever , wherever she may be 
I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so fucking special I wish I was special\ 
But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here ? 
I finally got my phone back , lets text yea ?

I'd rather diethan let you chew upon my energy i know you're no friend to meafter all you've done i'm free and i can finally seei'd rather die than let you ever get away with this you are the antithesis narcissist , this kiss could be upon my own lips i'd rather die

Truth #3 I always say things I don't mean I don't think of the consequences of saying them until they are said and done . It makes life harder on me but it's hard to work with . 
\Just sweep me off my feet again My new addiction I'll be waiting I've been addicted \"" 
truth #4 I try to be as caring as I possibly can all the time . Sometimes it can backfire though like when the other person doesn't care about you or when they take you for granted . 
Truth #5 I've always wanted to kiss someone in the rain :p Cheesy I know but I love the rain ... 
Sometimes people deny what they don't see . but sometimes you have to believe the person who does see it

Truth #6 I'm good at being friend zoned XD . I mean it sucks but I'm good at caring and listening . I'm just a really good friend .. just sometimes it sucks
