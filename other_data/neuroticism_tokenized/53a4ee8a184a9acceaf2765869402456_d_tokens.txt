Happy 2011 ! 

can take down marauding four-year-olds wielding killer crayons . 
The last day of break , and I finally managed to sleep in past nine . Typical .

absolutely loves Tahkodah and all my awesome friends there ! 
has spent all day tiling the bathroom , and it's still not done ... I miss Tahkodah . 
needs more siblings . 
ÝTake it easy , take it easy , don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy . Lighten up while you still can , don't even try to understand . Just fi 
ïnd a place to make your stand , and take it easy . 
gets to watch the band practice today ! And take pictures for yearbook , naturally . 
' s calculator just showed the low batteries message for the first time in the two years I've had it . That , my friends , is a win . 
probably enjoyed summer band more than the bandies . And wants to know who else bit the dust . 
has been waiting since 6 . 
needs to know everyone's schedules ! 
just found my Hamilton's Mythology book . Life is good again . 
finally has the chem assignment done ! Now to catch up on the journals ... and I don't even want to think about that paper . 
We don't need drugs . We have sprinkles . 
My schedule's finally ... finalized , if not fixed . And as soon as I finished one summer assignment , I added another to my list . So here it is :\

The Walgreens marquee says it's 126 degrees today ... 
just had the most traumatizing experience of my life ... :-O 
Old Scorpions -- now THAT is good music . Blackout , oh my goodness . 
We'll be missing this heat soon enough . 
finished the first draft of the analysis last night ! The hard part's done . Now just to edit . 
A cicada just landed on my ear . That is possibly the most awesome thing to happen to me all summer . :-D 
Official conclusion : It's hot outside . 
You know the feeling when you absolutely hate the song but you feel an urgent need to sing ? Yep . That's where I am . 
loves that the internet decided to go out right in the middle of catching up on the gov journal . 
Internet back . So instead of going straight to NPR's website , I go to Facebook . 
Waterboarding has nothing on grouting . 
English journal DONE !!! 
If < PROPFIRST > McCartney lost his voice in ' 64 , music would be completely different . Scary thought . 
Gov journals , please do me a favor and go die a quiet death somewhere in Antarctica . 
Go away , life . Let me sleep just a few hours . 
See yous in an hour ! 
loved Lionfest . I can't wait for the games to start so I can party with the band ! 
wishes she could see the FREE Kansas concert in Russellville . :-( 
thinks < PROPFEMALE > A . Hernandez should like her profile picture . 
just grilled drumsticks . Dinner's gonna be delicious ! 
is watching < PROPMALE > Gump . For the first time !!! 
< PROPMALE > Gump = awesomeness . Why did it take so long to see it ??? 
It feels so incredibly beautiful outside ! 
First week of school done ! First impression : It's going to be a great year . 
I felt a chill in the air . Gasp . 
' s marmot is like a scurvy lumberjack . 
All you Juniors , please vote me for President ! I love you all !!! 
Breaking news : < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > needs your vote for < PROPMALE > President !

Just a reminder to all you wonderful Juniors to pleasepleaseplease vote for me to be your President tomorrow ! It would mean so much to me . I love you guys ! 
Was partying with the Scanlons . What can be better ? 
How about that Federer shot ? :-D 
thinks I could actually like Kid Rock . Something's wrong ... 
\A leader is someone mucher . \ " Gotta love those third-graders ! " 
has for the first time ever lost the upper half of her range from screaming at that crazy-awesome ballgame . And can't wait for the next one . 
Error : Bad taste in music . Please delete playlist . 
just had an incredible experience convincing a totally snake-phobic family to hold our 7 1/2 foot rat snake . In the words of the formerly paranoid father : \That was actually cool ! \"" 
Chemistry , bane of my life . 
wonders what the reaction would be like if a mosque held a Bible burning . 
\Let's all flagella together ! \ " Oh Mrs. < PROPMALE >." 
FREEEEEEEEEEED !!!!!!!!! 
Music heals . 
Music heals . So take that , chemistry test . 
Is making muscadine jam and missing my < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ' Australia ' < PROPMALE > . 
Dear Calculus , \ 
Please start making sense . \ 
Love , me . \ 
P.S. I would appreciate it if you would stop making my brain explode , also . 
prefers teaching < PROPFIRST > about macromolecules to working on my own biology ^_^

wants to get some sleep . 
Already home , and it's not even five ! Good day . 
also would love for Beta members to vote for her ! :-D 
is thoroughly sick of limits . 
Woo , < PROPMALE > ! :-D 
Today's gonna be good . At least compared to yesterday . 
See how much I love you , band ? I sit on the opposing side to watch you march . 
had an absolutely AWESOME time with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and the rest at the Walk to Cure Diabetes ! You gaiz are wonderful !

Oh my goodness . Ribs to die for .

Curse your excessively verbose soul , < PROPFIRST > Dickens . 
was going to actually read the book like a good student . But then realized she still has 157 pages left . 
Everybody's working for the weekend , everybody wants a new romance . Everybody's going off the deep end , everybody needs a second < PROPMALE > . 
is alive . 
is now depressed . But I love my beastly bandies . ^_^ 
Off to Get Down Downtown ! Come hear us sing at ten ! 
is now going to sleep . Or attempt to , anyway . 
Don't die yet , Arkansas ! 
Arkansas ... you fail . 
Off to see Mraz . We'll see how he compares to Scorps and Eagles . 
What a sunset ... :-) 
So Luc and the Lovingtons aren't half bad ! Not my kind of music , but fun . Mraz in just a few ! 
Daaaaaang , Mraz can sing . That was WAY better than I expected . 
has listened to Paratum about thirty times . I almost have it memorized . And I'm just about to torch the thing . 
is cold . Where did summer go ?! 
Heart dissection : the perfect appetizer . 
loves artichoke . And makes a killer veggie-beef stew . 
has a nighthawk perched in a < PROPFEMALE > in front of her house . :-) 
is now going to memorize the Circle of Hell . 
is not a complete and total klutz . < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > most certainly did not see what they thought they saw . 
likes Beebe's commercial about how he creates jobs . It's the only one I've seen that doesn't slander the opponent . 
completely failed at procrastinating successfully . It's annoying when that happens . 
I keep checking the freezer ... but ice cream still hasn't magically appeared . 
needs to stop procrastinating . Seriously . 
There is absolutely no better way to end the day than helping < PROPMALE > high quiz bowl :-) 
loves The Big Bang Theory . 
Congrats , Wildcats ! 
Congratulations , Lions ! Way to go ! 
It's only been ten months , and I now have a functional bathroom ! Just need to get some details finished , and it'll finally be done . 
had a less than nutritious breakfast , since she was left a quarter-cup of milk . 
has a pretty awesome father . 
OHH MY GAWD . TENNESSEE , WHAT DID YOU JUST DO ??? 
is about to drive ... in the dark ... and the wind ... all alone ... all the way to Searcy ... to a place that I've only been once ... to pick up < PROPFIRST > . Wish me luck ! 
There is no freedom like driving alone down the dark open highway . Until the backseat-driving little brother gets picked up , at which point freedom becomes remarkably burdensome . 
just had an hour-long debate with the padre about whether the little snake is a prairie kingsnake or black rat snake . And I won ! Kingsnake it is . 
needs to focus on cal . But I can't force myself to ... 
does not appreciate having bio and cal tests on the same week . 
showered in her own bathroom for the first time in ten months ! :D 
Quiz Bowl = love . 
Is finished writing the rough drafts of those accursed song-novel-relating paragraph things . FINALLY . Now to type them . 
is done typing ! I just have to print . And that shall wait until morning . Good thing I didn't have any other homework ... * rolls eyes * 
It's six thirty , and I'm already done with dinner and starting homework ! That hasn't happened in recent memory . 
desperately wants to see The Guess Who and Loverboy at the State Fair . 
has been working calculus problems the past three hours . Putting off the bio and chem homework . I dang better make a good grade on that test ! 
completely blew off homework last night to finish my book . Definitely not Tale of Two Cities . It was worth it . :) 
Not too good , not too bad -- always on the brink of mediocre ! 
thought she knew band geeks until she came to Harding to listen to the Saint < PROPFIRST > Brass Quintet . The music majors in the audience make me laugh . 
So , the \Divertimento for Neglected (?) Musical (?) Instruments (?) \ " totally made my evening . " 
got a great recording of the band's halftime performance today ! Expect to see it on Facebook . 
\That is a Capitalist cookie ! \ " Only Letterman can eat a cookie and get applause . " 
Good luck , band ! I'll be there cheering you on . March like the beasts you are ! 
It actually said \Infinity hours remaining . \ " Time for Plan B . Suggestions ? " 
is NEVER driving through Little Rock on Air Show day again . 
WHO'S THE < PROPMALE > OF THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD ?!!! 
hates technology with a burning passion . >_< 
finally got technology to work ! Now go check out my video of our band . 
missed the first 10:10 . But I have so much to do , I'll easily make the next . 
Driving alone is ... therapeutic . And a great way to put off homework . 
Biology done ! I think . Now English , then chem , then every last minute that I can devote to cal . And once again choir goes by the wayside . 
\WARNING : Marshmallows are flammable . \"" 
10:10 10/10/10 ! I made it ! 
Oligolopoly . 
It just hit me that the PSAT's tomorrow and I haven't practiced . Guess what I'm doing tonight ? 
Ah , PSAT ... how glad I am that you have no essay . 
I'm coming for you , PSAT . Be afraid . 
is gonna beat < PROPFIRST>'s PSAT score , whatever it may be ! 
totally beat < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > on the PSAT . 
You're welcome to join our psychotic little family . 
is going through withdrawal . I didn't get my daily dose of < PROPFIRST > Azuz ! 
Stirrin ' the purple soup , cha-cha , cha-cha , stirrin ' the purple soup , boogie-woogie-woogie , purple potatoes and purple tomatoes and what ? 
had a good day . :-) 
is not ready for the chem test . But that's what the half-hour drive to school is for . 
Fridays just don't seem like Fridays when you have two nine-weeks tests . 
is going to celebrate the end of nine-weeks-tests week at the game ! GO LIONS ! 
How sweet of you guys to let them win their Homecoming ! We know you would've held them otherwise . 
I race today to honor those who died , to encourage those who fight , and to celebrate those who won . To my family and millions more : Stay strong -- we WILL win ! 
Aww , guys ... You were beastly . Seriously . Judges are dumb . 
Homework ? Read this book ? Read the other book ? Sleep ? Waste away listening to music ? So many options for only eleven hours . 
Calculus , submit to me or else ... or else what ? Who am I kidding , if it doesn't I'll be in this same situation at semester and it will be laughing maniacally . 
has been staring at one cal problem for over an hour . On the bright side , I've refamiliarized myself with my Eagles albums ... 
Dear Kelly , \ 
I'm back ! \ 
Best regards , \ 
Life 
has Mountain Dew Throwback . Life is good . 
was happily enjoying < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > when < PROPFIRST > turned on Gaga . What a comedown ... :( 
despises memory cards ( or the lack thereof ) . On the bright side , I get to just enjoy our band play for once ! 
And hearing you guys play was definitely worth it . You rock , band ! 
underestimated the time we'd return home .. by almost an hour ... 
is tired . Yawn . 
Our cal class is taking a field trip to Froyo's . Tomorrow . 
is getting a class ring ! And a beautiful one it is . 
The earlier I get home , the less I get done . And it all comes back to haunt me in the morning . 
loves staying at school until 7 on early-out days . Thank you , yearbook . 
is a good yearbookie . 
is partying with Scanlons . Be jealous . 
is finally home . :-) 
cannot get the first ten songs from the All-Region practice CD to import to iTunes correctly . Anyone else having the same problem ? Or , even better , a solution ? 
And , so far as I can tell , Windows Media Player saves the day . Take that , iTunes . 
would like to know why her alarm decided to be silent and she didn't get up until two minutes before time to leave . 
Apparently I have a shrine to < PROPFIRST > Bieber hidden in my closet ... D: 
loves her bandies . ^_^ <3 
Hello again , ACT , old foe . I come to conquer . Consider yourself warned . 
ACT : Officially conquered . Except for that lovely science part . 
Can today get any more beautiful ? 
had just decided that spring is her favorite season when she took an autumn walk through her swamp . 
thinks that toasting marshmallows is an acceptable excuse for defying the burn ban . 
desperately needs a functional memory card reader . 
Sitting on Facebook just trying to waste time ... On the bright side , my practice music is finally on iTunes ! Maybe I'll start practicing in time for Saturday's tryouts . 
Mtn . Dew doesn't give me a sufficient caffeine high to study cal and chem ... 
Happy late Mole Day ! 
is beasting on < PROPFEMALE > . Sicut Erat , not so much . Something's wrong ... 
misses PAP chem tests -- no study necessary . 
Wish my team was in the World Series . Wish a team I have any feeling about was in it . Even the Yankees , so I could enjoy watching someone crush them . But no ... 
The gremlin ... it haunts me ... 
is a believer . The Hunger Games trilogy is one of the best series I've read in a long time . 
Eww . Cold . Yuck . Go away . I miss 100+ weather . 
most definitely did not scream along with Cadence 3 and the final Fight Song on the night before All-Region tryouts . I would never risk my throat to party . :-P 
All-Region Choir tryouts ! 
Up at 4:45 , at the HS just in time to leave at 6:30 , but then waited forty minutes for the bus . In the cold . Called to sing at 8:30 . And didn't sing until 10 . 
Sleep . I like it . 
got beautiful pawprint earrings and Twix for Halloween . ^_^ 
I hate having to celebrate 21st chair . But it's not too bad . I'll almost certainly get bumped into Mixed Choir , and maybe I'll get to try out for All-State . But my singing ability really isn't determined by a nervous minute of audition on Latin hymns ( as much as I convince myself it is ) . I can sing along with my own favorite music well enough for myself , and that's what matters to me . 
I'ma getting fat on Twix ... I think it's worth it . 
hopes the 1st period APUSH students get stale doughnuts . 
Done with the first < PROPFEMALE > of soundbites ! Yay ... 
got up at 5:30 so Madre could vote at 7 so we wouldn't be totally late ... and then we found out polls don't open until 7:30 . Sigh . 
\It's punishing you for something you hadn't even done yet ! It's proactive karma ! \"" 
is very proud of a certain friend's romantic success . ^_^ 
I plan to spend my long weekend productively : finishing the next three Wheel of Time books so I can maybe start the new one sometime this year . 
Band , I love you ! What a great way to end the marching season . And congratulations , team , on the win ! 
< PROPMALE > Pena is hilarious . Even needing a translator , he's a crack-up on Letterman . 
I challenge the Scanlons to teach me to enjoy shopping . Good luck with that ! Mwahaha . 
has a beautiful prom dress . ^_^ 
FINALLY home . Nothing like dress shopping to give you an appreciation for jeans and a t-shirt . 
had a great time at HU's Homecoming with a certain < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Way to go , Bisons ! Now ... homework ... sigh ... 
Forty-three double replacement reactions to finish by tomorrow . And then gov , bio , cal , and yearbook . It's going to be a long day . 
Ohhh , that's bad . The solutions left off the last 4 reactions . 
Only three hours , and 43 reactions are finished ! 
Cal , here I come ... 
has a mole by her nose just like Obama . 
Sleep ! <3 
is tempted to watch TV simply to enjoy the non-political commercials . 
ACT scores are up ! 
Kimmi Scanlon is an incredible person and always cheers me up . :D 
What a rainbow ! 
My chemistry conclusion took an entire < PROPFEMALE > . I'm guessing that's a little overboard . 
Watching Bon Jovi live in New York online ! :D 
McRae Elementary teacher < PROPFEMALE > Newby died today after a long and determinded fight against cancer . My heart goes out to her family . 
went to a presentation by an astrophysicist and signed a list that will be sent to Mars next year ! Except now I have to worry about junk mail from Martians ... 
could live off pears like these . 
finished The Deathly Hallows again . I'd forgotten just how good it is ! The conclusion is perfect .

And back to Searcy again . 
Hubris , meet Nemesis . 
Dreams aren't practical . 
gave blood today ... and nearly passed out . And not even when they stuck me , but after it was over ! Sigh . 
Apparently a quart of egg nog counts as heavy lifting . 
Finally going deer hunting , the first < PROPMALE > I've had this season ! Wish me luck ... 
has ninja deer . 
is thankful for her school and excellent teachers , her wonderful family , and , most of all , you , her incredible friends , whom she could never live without . Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Yay Auburn ! 
Deathly Hallows is quite as good the second time ! 
Call me Dr. Love . 
Go Hogs ! 
is not a football fan . But that touchdown was EPIC . 
partied . 
Ah ... home at last . 
< PROPMALE > , I've missed you . 
was so proud of the weather . I didn't have to wear a jacket regularly until the last few days . I guess it is December , though . 
I just love spending hours on calculus that I could use sleeping , and getting nothing accomplished . Go die somewhere dark and lonely , sigma notation . 
enjoys finishing homework with ten minutes to spare . 
is hopelessly in love with t-shirt weather in December . <3 
War Eagle ! 
Sigh . Sitting on cold concrete by Race for an HOUR before the parade . Feel like a creeper ... 
enjoyed the parade , even if it was cold . And yay Auburn ! 
gets a sadistic joy out of watching calculus scratch papers burn . 
is a beast . 
Heyyy , can anyone tell me what the random < PROPFIRST > in statuses are about ? 
69 . Thou < PROPMALE > a creeper , but an awesome one . You make me smile . :-D 
What's on my mind ? The yearbook I should be working on . 
Another breath begins , another < PROPMALE > to win the fight . 
The way you sang just blew my mind , gave me chills from head to toe ... what a glorious night ... 
Finally watching Inception ! And actually understanding almost as much as I don't ... 
And there went everything I thought I understood about Inception at the beginning . 
All day with the < PROPMALE > high quiz bowl team ? Yeah , I can handle that . 
And then I asked that child why this night has a < PROPFEMALE > , and he said so we know that we could see that far ... 
enjoyed singing with the Harding choir today and seeing all my old friends ! And loved Mr. Jones ' face after that horrific slide . :-D 
sang to old people . Now I'm sitting in on a class of 4th graders ! 
I miss the days when we could spend all period just working out the averages of two sets of < PROPFIRST > . 
Fourth-graders : sweet and cooperative . Third-graders : * dies * 
I only had one test today ! I'm actually going to get home by 4 ! 
\Do you know my brother ? \ " \ 
made it through the first semester of calculus with an A ! Life is good .

can't wait for the TSO concert !!! Who else is going ? 
Nothing goes together better than pyrotechnics , killer guitar , and a heck of a good voice ! TSO rocks .

Beware , Alabama ! The < PROPFEMALE > family is about to fall upon you with the awesomeness of ten thousand flaming suns .

How're Region tryouts going ? 
Hey , look . It's snowing . 
Maybe if I don't do my sound bites , we'll have school tomorrow . Seeing as choir can't afford to miss . 
At least I can put off the sound bites one more day . 
I don't suppose the weather will see fit to close school tomorrow , too ... 
owes an apology to Jennah < PROPFEMALE > Denney and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ... seeing as I just finished 3/4 of my sound bites before learning that we have no school again tomorrow . Planned procrastination FAIL .

Chondricthyes ! 
Best name ever -- Blue Blubber Jellies ! 
wouldn't last a week in Baltimore . And yet Johns Hopkins is looking more and more appealing . 
just stopped at the Westminster Burying Ground to see < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe's grave . R.I.P. , Poe . < PROPFEMALE>'s most brilliant artist . 
Fun fact of the day : the World Trade Center-Baltimore is the world's tallest pentagonal building . 
Hello , D.C. ! 
Guess what . They're reconstructing the Reflecting Pool . 
Gotta love being a dumb tourist . 
Yesterday : Dad's former office building , the White House and surrounding buildings , the Washington Memorial , and the Holocaust museum . Today , more fun ! 
You have to go to the Pentagon to get a faulty metro ticket exchanged ? Seriously ? 
Just left the Longworth House Office Building . Saw the Ways and Means , Agriculture , and Natural Resources committee rooms , and toured < PROPMALE > Crawford's office ! 
' I cannot live without books . ' Thomas < PROPMALE > , 1815 . Just spent the last hour drooling over the Library of Congress , including < PROPMALE>'s private collection . 
Hike across half of D.C. in heels to see a dance production ? Yes sir-ee . 
is a beast at running across crazy D.C. highways in heels . In other news , the dance performance was actually really fun ! 
Heading to the Natural History and American History museums today ! 
The Natural History Museum is fascinating , and the American History must be equally so , if we get time to explore . Now Hard Rock Cafe and Ford's Theatre ! 
Dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe + a play at Ford's Theatre = best evening so far ! 
Starting the final day in D.C. by trying to dig up the original Constitution and Declaration at the National Archives . 
Quiz bowl really has warped me . I could've spent all day ogling the < PROPMALE > , Rembrandt , and < PROPFEMALE > paintings at the National Gallery of < PROPMALE > . AND LEGIT PICASSOS ! 
Alas , today we leave D.C. But we're not quite done -- on the way out , we'll stop at Monticello . 
loved D.C. But it's good to be home . <3 
The break's been GREAT ! But I'll be glad to get back to school . 
No apologies\ 
( no apologies)\ 
We will not back down\ 
We are not afraid\ 
Not a drop of doubt ... 
It's not enough to not give it all . 
is a terrible liar . 
And when storms are high and your dreams are low ... I wish you the strength to let love go . 
When your alarm doesn't go off and you still get up at 6 , you know you have no life . 
' He fused metal and wood!'\ 
' Wait , so I could fuse Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Dark Magician with this ?! ' Love quiz bowl trips . :-D 
Weve got tonight . Who needs tomorrow ? Lets make it last . Lets find a way . Turn out the lights , come take my hand now . Weve got tonight , babe . Why dont you stay ? 
Warm breeze on my face , grass under my bare fee t--t his is what spring should be . :) 
Weather's a jerk . 
Desperado , why don't you come to your senses ? You've been out riding fences for so long now . 
* as we prepare to take a calculus quiz*\ 
< PROPMALE > Windley : \Well 
The first part of our Crucible video is done ! 
Cookie dough . Yum . 
And I used to think that typical Mayes tests were of the devil . These AP things make his worst test seem like one of Coach Turney's . 
Barely done with one yearbook , and I'm already stressed about the next . Oh the joy . 
really enjoyed the Scholar's Ceremony this time . I can't believe you guys are seniors . I'm gonna miss you . :( 
Mental breakdown . Life , please die . 
It's gonna be a long day . 
Why did it take so long to discover Signs ? 
just wrote a fascinating story about this high school girl wanting to be a racecar driver . Hoping I did well enough ! 
An endlessly looping Chipmunks arrangement of Supertramp's \Logical Song\ " . Joy . " 
has curly hair ?! 
How many girls does it take to open a straightener ?... 
My article got first ! Woop woop ! 
thought tomorrow was never going to come . 
has to suffer through the National Chemistry Olympiad before prom . But hey , maybe I can pick up a last-minute date there ! ;D 
Five hours of chemistry . My head hurts . 
So , prom . That thing . It happened . 
Life was forever , yesterday . 
If you haven't paid for your senior t-shirt yet , please , please , please pay me or Kimmi Scanlon tomorrow ! Thank you so much ! 
Must be the fortieth wreck in front of our house since we've lived here , and the first I've witnessed . Thank goodness the kids were wearing seatbelts , or they'd be dead . 
Any < PROPMALE > who bought a shirt from Kimmi or myself : provided they come in today , pick them up tomorrow in Mrs. White's room ! And pay us please ! 
But it was all just fantasy . The wall was too high , as you can see . No matter how he tried , he could not break free . 
If you don't pay today , your shirt goes to someone who can ! If you have paid , pick them up in Mrs. White's room ! 
is wearing my first Senior shirt . Holy crud . This is really happening . 
How do you condense years of friendship into one yearbook message ? 
Fishing < PROPMALE > , boat , it has been far too long . Please forgive me , welcome me back , and catch me a big fish . Or five . 
First proper sunburn of the year , and it feels good . :-D 
got to spend all weekend working outside and not doing nerd things ! And consummated it with a delicious fish fry . Now for the homework I've been avoiding ... 
Best quiz bowl practice EVER . What were we on ?! 
is in the white zone . 
Biology , here I come . After Idol . 
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up , giving me enough time in my life to grow up . Time , be my friend . Let me start again . 
State ACTM Cal test today . How to study : create a new calculator program with all the derivative formulas listed . 
What's the integral of ( 1/cabin ) d(cabin) ? 
is wondering what happened to the AP tests being a distant nightmare . Chem tomorrow . DANG . 
If it doesn't stop raining , I might not even be able to get to Searcy to take the test tomorrow . Not good . 
Potassium , sodium , and ammonium salts , whatever they may be , can always be depended on for solubility . 
Hello , water ... everywhere ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s stressing over his thermochem test . Hahahahahahaha . 
And now , sleep . :) \ 
\ 
HAHA ! Sleep . You're funny . The cal test is Wednesday . 
Frozen computers make me feel claustrophobic ... 
is about to go kick some AP Calculus asymptote . :D 
I could have missed the pain\ 
But I'd have had to miss the dance . 
Today could not get any more beautiful . :) 
Congratulations , class of 2011 ! You made it . :) 
Two tests down . Three to go . I can do this . 
Happy birthday , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > !!! 
was a terrified AP test virgin a week and a half ago . But now that I've survived four , I'm almost excited about the last . Bring it , English ! 
No more AP tests , no more grades , no more Seniors ... what's the point of me even coming back to school ? 
got to look through Westside yearbooks from 2002 and 2003 . You guys were actually cute back then ! 
< PROPFEMALE > . You are REALLY DUMB . 
Jump-roping with pig intestines is not the weirdest thing we've considered in biology . Trust me . 
This is the world we live in , and these are the hands we're given . Stand up and let's start showing just where our lives are going to . 
See , once upon a time , things were easier , but we were all different back then . We're not those people any more . 
Riverfest . < PROPFIRST > Daniels Band , REO Speedwagon , and Poison . YES . 
Love Mondays . \ 
5:45 -- wake up\ 
5:47 -- realize it's Monday\ 
1st period -- watch the end of The Crucible\ 
2nd period -- finish gov vocab\ 
3rd period -- fail ( again ) at setting off thermite\ 
4th period -- wash pig dissection trays\ 
5th-7th periods -- get stabbed twice and lose a pint of blood\ 
But then quiz bowl ! So it was all worth it . 
Congratulations , class of 2012 . 87% of us are literate . :D 
iPhone 4 or Motorola Atrix ? 
~ Tell me what it takes to let you go . ~ 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Crawford and < PROPFIRST > Moreland ! Like , a lot . 200 feet of bubble wrap = best birthday gift EVAR !!! \ 
And , a huge thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday . It's been the best ! 
The girl driving down the highway in the ancient off-white Camry with the windows down and the music up ? Yeah , that's me . :D 
What if today really is your last ? Did you live it so you'd have no regrets ? 
Lazy Saturday . Nothing to do . Sooooooo bored . If half of one day leaves me like this , the summer's gonna be torture ... 
If you ever get annoyed , look at me , I'm self-employed . I love to work at nothing all day . :D 
Six o'clock ... still waiting ... Rapture ? I think not . 
http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/149805/20110522/harold-camping-silent-after-doomsday-dud.htm 
is liking this whole no-homework thing . 
New Guns-N-Roses Greatest Hits album ! Great way to start the morning . 
Last day of school . It's so unreal . 
So , this is it , then . I'm gonna miss you guys over the summer . Until August , then ! 
Do we take ourselves too seriously -- or not seriously enough ? 
Dear third graders :\ 
If you are going to cheat on the science lab pos t-t est , at least choose someone intelligent to cheat off of . It's not good when two identically-bubbled answer sheets get 35% . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
Your friendly neighborhood teacher's daughter . 
Hiding from the weather in a Harding basement with some guys from THV ! I feel like I've met celebrities . :D 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . You are god . 
 ? There's nothing quite like helping with the elementary's field day . Who would've thought 1st and 2nd graders were so easily amused by a parachute and dod 
 ? geballs ? 
is way excited to see < PROPFIRST > Daniels tonight ! 
< PROPFIRST > who ? < PROPFIRST > Nail ? Okay , you're pretty good . :D 
Daaaang . < PROPFIRST > Nail was good . But < PROPFIRST > Daniels is a BEAST . 
cannot WAIT to see REO tonight !!! 
OHMYGOSH REO SPEEDWAGON IS INCREDIBLE !!! And I am SO FREAKING JEALOUS that our own < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > got to sing with them ! 
So if you're tired of the same old story , oh , turn some pages . \ 
I will be here when you are ready to roll with the changes . 
One week of vacation , and now it's back to school for a month . Thanks a lot , oral comm . 
\I'll sell them at like 200 bucks a pop . Little Italian men imported from Belgium . \ " -- < PROPFIRST > " 
Thinking about Tahkodah . Looking forward to July . :) 
is liking this whole college thing . 
School administration is ridiculous . What is the point of intentionally making this unnecessarily impossible ?! Be proud of us and facilitate our < PROPMALE > to show off the school . Don't drag us down because we're good . 
Living is easy with eyes closed , misunderstanding all you see . 
Eight P.M. , and finally leaving school . Love summer break . 
Congrats , < PROPMALE > ! You finally grew to 4000 people . 
Clothes shopping is a harrowing experience . 
Second time through Inception = still mind-blowing . 
FEDERER !!! 
Eh . Good match . Shame Federer lost . Again . But Nadal earned it . 
Putting up siding on a 100 degree day with ice water and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . That's how I roll . 
never expected being captain of Searcy's Quiz Bowl team to be so much work even before the year starts . But I wouldn't trade it for anything ! 
It's weird coming back to Southwest after so many years . The Thunderbirds teachers haven't aged a day , making it so much more apparent how much I've grown since then . I'm a Senior already . What experiences come next ? 
These days , the stars seem out of reach . \ 
These days , there ain't a ladder on these streets . \ 
These days are fast , nothing lasts in this graceless age . \ 
There ain't nobody left but us these days . 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , anyone ? 
First impromptu speech today . Two , actually , if you count meeting with Mr. Smith to get this whole mess sorted out . Wish me luck ! I need it ... 
Killed that first impromptu ! :DDD At least , compared to how I'd expected it to go . 
0.9999 ... = 1 . Mind is blown . 
Who should I go to for senior pictures ? 
I don't know why I even care . We get so high , and get nowhere ... 
Are you the one and only who's sad and lonely , reachin ' for the top ? \ 
Well the music keeps you goin ' and it's never gonna stop . 
is cold ?! What happened to the world ?! 
does like a good summer storm . :) 
So Madre walks inside to check the weather on the computer , even though I'm sitting right next to her with my iPhone out . Parents and technology . Just can't keep up . :P 
My room is finally clean again ! Now it feels all lonely and not-lived-in ... 
Lunch > nap > writing tomorrow's oral comm speech . 
now has an EBSCO app . Sigh . 
First formal speech was a success ! 
I wonder if you wonder . 
This is simply over in the most complete of ways . But still I hope . 
just got a letter from the mayor of Searcy congratulating me on my plans to attend Harding University -.- Come on people , it's one class . I'm not planning on sticking around . :P 
Rest in peace , < PROPFIRST > Clemons . You and your incredible sax will be missed . 
Happy Father's Day to the most amazing dad in the world ! And to all the others , but , you know . :) 
~ Pathways in my mind that lead to nowhere\ 
Promises of happiness that leave me wanting more\ 
When my < PROPFEMALE > becomes a nightmare\ 
Feel paranoia about what I'm wishing for ... ~ \

Journey . Foreigner . Night Ranger . Memphis . September . YES . 
You made a first-class fool out of me , but I'm as blind as a fool can be . 
Pride and Prejudice . Part 1 , chapter 19 . How dumb can Mr. Collins be ?! 
\Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? \ " -- Pride and Prejudice " 
COULD be quiz bowling at National Beta right now . But nooooooo . Boo you , administration . I need a break from summer . 
has AMAZING seats for the Journey/Foreigner/Night Ranger concert ! I can't wait for September !!! 
Definitely just drove 30 down a 45 backstreet just to finish listening to Zeppelin . XD 
Mmm . Bacon . 
finished Pride and Prejudice . Good book . :) 
Dissect a battery ? Yes please . 
Household uses for vinegar : shining glassware , polishing stainless steel , neutralizing potential KOH spills . 
~ Daytime , nighttime , anytime -- things are better with rock ! ~ 
Hello , my name is < PROPFIRST > , and I love my friends , my quiz bowl , and my classic rock . :) 
Love how the Internet always stops working the day before big projects are due . And I thought I was being so responsible starting on tomorrow's speech before noon . 
Foreign policy . Ewwwwwwww . 
Sooooo ready to get this speech finished . 
Second run-through of the speech -- seven seconds to spare . This is gonna be interesting . Wish me luck today ! 
Ha-lay-loo-ya ! Class is cancelled for the day ! Another 24 hours to chop 30 seconds out of my speech ! 
So , I'm currently a Red Wolf , Bison , and Lion ... conflicted ? Maybe a little . 
Speech = 7min 45sec = success . :D 
So near , so far away \ 
We pass each other by ' cause we don't know what to say \ 
It's so clear , I'm sorry to say \ 
But if you wanna win you gotta learn how to play \ 
Head games ... 
My amazingest cousins < PROPFEMALE > Fountain and < PROPFEMALE > Fountain got me a Gryffindor shirt and < PROPFEMALE > Botts Every Flavor Jellybeans . I am now fully prepared for Deathly Hallows part II !!! 
Last day of oral comm ! You know , I think I'm actually going to miss this class and all the crazy characters in it ... 
First day of July ! You know what that means ? \ 
AP RESULTS . 
hates Hanging With Friends . 50/50 shot between F and G , one strike and one balloon left , and I tapped M instead . Svsusjnjxdne dadgummit . 
College searching . Ughhhh . Just let me stay in high school for the rest of forever . 
Bullfrog = big . 
is off to catch a river monster . 
burnt my arms , scorch < PROPMALE > the soles of my feet , dug up turtle eggs , dove into shallow water , chas < PROPMALE > tiger beetles , taught damselfly sex < PROPMALE > , and was attack < PROPMALE > by flying carp , and still had time to catch the only keeper drum and largemouth . This fishing trip , finally , was a success . 
Yikes ... hadn't realized just how badly I got burned ... again ... you'd think one of these days I'll have burned enough times to actually stay tan ... worthless 50 SPF . Ah well . Worth every day of pain . :) 
To live at all is miracle enough . 
had a delicious barbecue chicken dinner outside under a sky full of our new baby bats , all out testing their wings ^_^ 
And finishing it off with the last of a carton of Hog Heaven . Missing Yarnell's already . :( 
Anyone at Pops on the River ? 
Boys who sing are sexy . XD 
has proper bangs . And my chem AP score . 
Oh happy day :D 
It was so great to finally get the gang back together today ! 
Happy birthday to Ringo < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Slow down , you crazy child . \ 
You're so ambitious for a juvenile . \ 
But then , if you're so smart , tell me , \ 
Why are you still so afraid ?... \ 
You got your passion , you got your pride , \ 
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied ? \ 
Dream on , but don't imagine they'll all come true . \ 
When will you realize ? \ 
Vienna waits for you . 
Here's to Atlantis and the final shuttle launch ever . What a sight . : ' -) 
Scheduled senior pics ... working on a college application ... daaaang . I'm old . 
Think I'm gonna be a rock < PROPFEMALE > . 
is a nerd . Just in case you didn't know . 
< PROPFIRST > got mad at me for talking to yeast , then promptly called air bubbles \lil homies . \ " I think we've inhaled too much pure oxygen . " 
Note to self : it's far easier to isolate carbon dioxide with vinegar/baking soda than with yeast . 
is totally gonna rock that epic farmer's tan today . 
Travs < PROPMALE > , and we caught a foul ball . Not a bad start to the ballgame . 
has the outline of my swimsuit perfectly seared into my skin . Here we go again ... 
THIRTY-FIVE AND ONE-HALF HOURS . 
It was so great to get to chat with the wonderful < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > for the first time in way too long ! And , I hope Meggie had a great birthday ! And , the third time through Inception left me way more confused than the first two times ... 
HARRYPOTTERHARRYPOTTERGARRYPOTTERHARRYPOTTER 
< PROPMALE > POTTER . 
And so childhood ends . Farewell , < PROPMALE > Potter . Mischief managed . 
And now , for the first time in a lifetime , there is no more < PROPMALE > Potter to expect . I feel so empty ... but what a way to go out . Eighteen straight hours of reminiscing and dreaming with some of the most amazing friends in the world . < PROPFEMALE > up , Generation < PROPMALE > Potter . Life goes on , and a sweet life it is . 
Watching quail dusting in our backyard . :) 
Facebook is so much cooler with the language set to Pirate . 
Doing my darndest to convince the padres to get a Silverado instead of a Dodge . And possibly just succeeded . 
would love to learn to play my old guitar ... if only I actually had the time for it ... 
Seeing the chem class and < PROPFEMALE > today for that hard-earned steak dinner . So , naturally , I would wake up before 6 like it's a proper school morning . >_< 
Who knew ? That old Camry actually looks halfway decent once it's clean . 
Hello again , it's you and me\ 
Kinda always like it used to be\ 
Sipping wine , killing time , \ 
Tryin ' to solve life's mysteries . \ 
How's your life ? It's been a while . \

Budge , judge , pudge , nudge ? Hanging with Friends is driving me crazy . 
And I thought I was done with having my teeth forcibly shifted . Thanks , Collazo . Owwww . 
Computers . Hate them . All of my passion . 
Seems I've started a Facebook language revolution . :D 
Mother's never gonna let me go off to college . She's gonna keep me locked up to give her lab ideas for the rest of forever . Not to mention differentiating between transpiration and respiration every other day .

Because who doesn't like controversy ? Read the listener comments on this , especially starting about halfway through . They're surprisingly thoughtful -- and even more surprisingly , respectful . 
Selling yearbook ads is such a great way to spend one of my last free days . =/

The wait may be worth it , \ 
But how can you wait anymore\ 
When you're wondering what you're waiting for . \

He just needs a < PROPMALE > to grow . \ 
Take it easy , take it slow , \ 
And don't let him go . 
Happy Facebook one-year anniversary to me ! XD 
Yuck , the brother thing comes back today . On the bright side , Tahkodah tomorrow , so I get another week away from him ! 5th session peoples , who's all gonna be there ? 
Othello = epic . 
Off to one final week of Tahkodah ! Been looking forward to this allllllllll summer . Goodbye , cruel world ! I won't miss you ! 
Cabin 5 : Champion Cabin . Yes , we're that good . Love you guys ! I'm going to miss camp sooooo much next year . 
\You just got owned by your grandmother . \"" 
Genealogy blows my mind . 
She said you hurt her so , \

You're not the hurting kind . \ 
She says she loves you\ 
And you know that can't be bad ! \ 
She loves you\ 
And you know you should be glad ... 
Best way to spend a muggy summer night : lounging in a hot tub with the cousins . :D 
Home sweet home . Finally . <3 
What the heck . \ 
We're Seniors now . \ 
1st : Cal II/maybe a computer class ? \ 
2nd : AP Eng IV\ 
3rd : APUSH\ 
4th : Choir IV\ 
5th : Creative Writing\ 
6th : Physics\ 
7th : all alone in yearbook once again ... \ 
What lunch do I have , anyone know ? Because I don't XD 
Just because someone's paranoid doesn't mean they're not right . 
In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take , the relationships we were scared to have , and the decisions we took too long to make . 
Finally getting the AC in that danged Camry fixed ! So excited it's not even funny . One issue down , two to go ... 
No chemistry this year = I can wear not-closed-toe shoes any time I want ! Well , except choir concerts . 
The one thing I'll miss about summer ( besides spamming you all with status updates ): midday naps . 
Power just went out . \ 
Joy . 
just used the word \fastidiously\ " in casual conversation . " 
\The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell . \"" 
If somebody sent you\

That heaven don't exist ? 
Stuck at Searcy's administration office ... all day ... who knew buying stuff was so difficult ? 
So , the percent sign is actually 0 divided by 0 ... my head hurts ... 
I AM SO EXCITED . \ 
My car has AC for the first time in like five years . \ 
I CAN'T STOP SMILING . 
... unless it's Thursday . 
Actually got to sleep for twelve hours ! I'm happy . Course , now that I finally can , school's about to start . Sigh .

I woke last night to the sound of thunder\ 
How far off I sat and wondered\ 
Started humming a song from 1962\ 
Ain't it funny how the night moves\ 
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose\ 
Strange how the night moves\ 
With autumn closing in . 
College applications . \ 
W00t . 
wishes people would stop vanishing in the middle of text conversations . Especially when I've told them that a dozen times , but also those I haven't mentioned it to . :P 
Darn you , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . Now I need a Straight No Chaser album . In other news , I have too many Tahkodah pictures . 
As in , 637 pictures . Um . 
You could wait forever\ 
Lord , I can't do that\ 
Spend a lifetime looking back\ 
Now I'm over-thinking\ 
Love can't be this hard\ 
We seem to be drifting\ 
Worlds apart 
What be troublin ' me ? The fact that we lost our computer for three weeks to supposedly clean it up so it would actually run , and now that we have it back , it's even slower than before . Which is REALLY SLOW . 
Alright , computer . If you're done with your hissy fit , maybe you can upload my pictures now . 
When you try your best , but you don't succeed\ 
When you get what you want , but not what you need\ 
When you feel so tired , but you can't sleep\ 
Stuck in reverse\ 
And the tears come streaming down your face\ 
When you lose something you can't replace\ 
When you love someone , but it goes to waste\ 
Could it be worse ? 
I've heard this strange rumor that you're supposed to remember the Sabbath or something , and not be busy on Sundays . But what modern human has time for that ? Even over the summer . I know I sure don't . :P 
I am so desperately ready for school to start back . Come on . One week . I can handle this . 
You know what goes really well with thunderstorms ? Dr. Pepper . 
Some dreams live , and some dreams die . It's high time I put this vegetable six feet under , but I don't want to pull the plug ... 
Rain <3 
I just danced in the rain . And it was beautiful . 
\It's like lighting a firecracker ! \ " -- said by Mom about shaking a bottle of corn syrup " 
It takes 42 muscles in your face to frown when someone ticks you off , but it only takes 4 muscles to reach out and smack them upside the head . 
Selling yearbook ads . In the rain . Like a boss . 
partied at the Scanlon residence . 
After ten hours of terrorizing the roads and businesses of Searcy , I'm finally home . Next order of business : SLEEP . 
Yo quiero quiz bowl . 
Over the past two days , I have unpackaged 30 pairs of scissors , 35 spoons , 36 erasers , and 24 Sharpies ; I have unpackaged and sharpened 50 pencils ; and I have made 757 copies , plus 700 more in groups of 28 . Searcy 4th and 5th graders , you better appreciate this . 
How do I beat the summer blues ? I meet up with < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > to play chess . 
And everything under the sun is in tune , \ 
But the sun is eclipsed by the < PROPFEMALE > .

Good : I don't have to chauffeur the brother thing around anymore ! \ 
Bad : He's driving me up to Searcy !

Last day of summer : party on the lake . Catch me some monster fish . Try to avoid a sunburn this time . 
Love the drunk old couple blaring < PROPMALE > Seger out of their houseboat . ^_^ 
And it was summertime\ 
It was sweet summertime , summertime . 
Here comes the last first day of high school . Seniors 2012 , let's make this a year we'll never forget ! 
Senior pictures today ! 
Thank you , SWMS traffic . Now we have to leave at the ridiculously early 6:45 instead of just the ridiculously early 7:00 . 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , how are you ? \ 
God knows it's heaven where you are . \ 
Find some peace there , \ 
May it never end . \ 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , my heart knows\ 
We'll meet again . \ 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , I'll see you\ 
Someday again . 
Some people come into our lives and quickly go . Others stay for a while , leave footprints on our hearts , and we are never , ever the same . 
Edwin : \Is the donkey really going to catch the car going 120 < PROPMALE > an hour ? \ " \ 
Last first Friday of high school ! 
Ah , when to the heart of a man\ 
Was it ever less than a treason\ 
To go with the drift of things , \ 
To yield with a grace to reason , \ 
And bow and accept the end\ 
Of a love or a season ? 
The last first week of high school is done ! Now , Lionfest ! So excited ! :DDDDD 
Hyde <3 ^64 
\I need to borrow your fetus ... \"" 
No , not a job ! Anything but that ! Don't make me !!! * wails incoherently * 
Who can say if I've been changed for the better ? \ 
But because I knew you\ 
I have been changed for good . 
Hey denizens of Searcy ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Crawford , Kimmi Scanlon , and I are making < PROPFIRST > jewelry for your delight ! All profits go to the new Searcy cancer center ! Like < PROPFIRST > gles For Cancer to learn more and see some of the ones we've made ! 
Thank you , computer , for completely ruining my morning . 
Working a few kinematics problems makes everything better . 
Physics , APUSH , English , cal review . But first , hauling wood and mowing the yard . Yay . 
Cal II starts tomorrow ! I'm probably looking forward to this more than I should . 
Hey Searcy peoples ! Please like my Jeangles For Cancer < PROPFEMALE > to get info and see the designs ! We'll have some at school for you to buy starting tomorrow ! 
Boo you , APUSH . I'll just finish reading you tomorrow . In Doc's class . Right before the quiz . Because surely we won't have anything to do in there . * rolls eyes * 
When Mayes wishes you luck with your cal class , you know you're in trouble . 
It's 10 and I'm just starting the essay . It's gonna be a long night . 
We gotta get out while we're young\ 
' Cause tramps like us\ 
Baby , we were born to run . 
Thank you , air conditioning , for completely soaking my car . Now I have a nasty car AND no AC again . DX 
Dear APUSH , \ 
Go dig a hole . \ 
I have better things to do . 
Wondering how long is too long to work on cal or wait for a reply . 
But in the end , Seniors are just college students who haven't left yet . 
Without heroes , we are all plain people , and don't know how far we can go . 
Dang you , EOO . You're gonna kill me before the actual cal does . 
First physics test today ! And then seeing about jobs and such . Woop . 
Ice cream and sleep . Sounds really good right about now . 
Oh , sleep . You never last long enough . 
So Searcy ! < PROPFEMALE > Crawford , Kimmi Scanlon , and I have Jeangles for you ! Come to us , buy one for $10 ! All profits go to the new cancer center ! Help us support the fight against cancer ! And like our < PROPFEMALE > Jeangles For Cancer ! 
An extra hour this morning to do my APUSH , FTW . 
Fright Night with the peeps -- actually not half bad , for a sorta horror movie ! 
You better stand tall when they're calling you out\ 
Don't bend , don't break , baby , don't back down . 
Two years . 
Watching No Strings Attached with the padres = extremely awkward . 
I use calculus to procrastinate . 
So corn smut is becoming Mexico's favorite delicacy . That's slightly disturbing . 
My computer will let me on Facebook , but not the medical center's site , where I'm trying to get a job . I think it's a sign . 
I don't believe that anybody feels\ 
The way I do about you now\ 
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding\ 
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding\ 
There are many things that I would\ 
Like to say to you\ 
I don't know how\ 
Because maybe\ 
You're gonna be the one who saves me\ 
And after all\ 
You're my wonderwall 
Advil , what would I ever do without you ? #headache 
has an overwhelming < PROPFEMALE > to fold my cal II homework . 
Calculus domination : mostly complete . I whooped that homework assignment . Enough . For a class that hasn't yet taken a grade on homework . 
Jeangles are still available ! Get yours just in time for the first Lions football game ! Only $10 , and all profits go to the new cancer center in Searcy ! See me , Kimmi Scanlon , or < PROPFEMALE > Crawford ! 
Application essay . Time to drag out my inner egotist . 
EEEEEEKKKK ! Officially just submitted my first college app . * freaks out * Where did my life go ??? 
\What's that line with the arrow under it ? \ " \ 
\Hitler's back ! And he brought a choir ! \"" 
You know that sometimes , it feels like\ 
It's all moving way too fast\ 
Use every alibi and words you deny\ 
That love ain't meant to last\ 
You can cry tough baby , it's all right\ 
You can let me down easy , but not tonight\ 
We're running with the shadows of the night\ 
So baby take my hand , it'll be alright\ 
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight\ 
They'll come true in the end 
is tired . 
is still tired . 
Using cal to solve an algebra-based physics problem is probably illegal . But hey , I got it right . 
When I head home , I hop in the ' 92 Camry , pop in a Boston cassette , turn it up , and headbang the whole way home . 
Buy me a drink , sing me a song , \ 
Take me as I come , ' cause I can't stay long . 
Bring $10 to myself , < PROPFEMALE > Crawford , or Kimmi Scanlon to purchase a Lion Pride Jeangle just in time for the first football game ! All profits go to Searcy's new cancer center . Go Lions ! 
Doc : \I'm working on the freaking party ! \ " \ 
Ready for some Searcy football ! And even more , the band . :DDDD 
Two touchdowns ! Yeahhhhh Searcy ! 
Now this is the way to spend a Friday night . 13-41 ! Way to go , Lions ! 
For you , life is just like chess\ 
If you don't make the move\ 
You'll lose the game like this\ 
Cause you , you're walking on the edge\ 
You , you choose the way of loving pain\ 
You , don't you see the bridge\ 
I've built for you\ 
It's just one step to start again 
Stupid Region practice music . Why must you be M4A files ? 
When you decide to believe something , you'd better be committed , and you'd better be prepared to deal with the consequences . 
There's not much that I loathe so much , I literally can't breathe when I think about it . But you're one . 
Yeah Hogs ! 
Lions yesterday , Hogs today . Gotta love such epic games . :D 
Woo Pig Sooie !!! 
Decadent breakfast of eggs over easy , fried up by none other than yours truly . Now to work . 
thinks someone should hurry up and post my Senior pictures already . :P 
Five cal assignments in one day ? Yeah , I got this . 
We just got a handwritten letter and pamphlet titled \What Hope for Dead Loved Ones ? \ " from a local Jehovah's Witness . Totally just made my day . " 
First assignment finished ! Yeah ! 
Wishing life made as much sense as this cal does . A nice universal formula to solve every problem , and if you can't figure it out , just go to < PROPMALE > for the answer . 
Only I could amuse myself ALL DAY with calculus . 
Don't you know that you are a shooting star ? \ 
And all the world will love you just as long\ 
As long as you are . 
It's Labor Day . I should be asleep . Why am I not ?! Oh , that's right . Calculus . 
The Camry changes its own oil . 
You know you're a choir nerd when warm saltwater no longer makes you gag . 
Weird life experience #73 : Taking the stitches out of Padre's finger . 
<3 finding random money . 
See , dresses and me , we don't get along too well . I think I'll wear jeans and a T to the homecoming assembly . 
QUIZBOWLQUIZBOWLQUIZBOWLQUIZBOWL . 
Quiz bowl days are great days . 
What an amazing day . :) 
smelled Bunsen burners today and realized how much I miss chem . 
Must . Stop . STUMBLING . 
By the way . Happy birthday , < PROPMALE > Mercury ! We love you ... 
Greatest physics class ever . 
I nearly lodged a pencil in Mr. Mayes ' ceiling . 
Calculus . I WILL CONQUER YOU . 
Physics : studied . Calculus : studied . APUSH : Sorry , Joyner , I'm just gonna have to wing this one . 
Today is everything that is difficult . Cal II test , physics test , APUSH quiz . Think of me . 
When I finish a Mayes test early , I fix all the grammar mistakes in his questions . 
was just about to go to sleep . Then I remembered that my flipping physics rocket is due tomorrow . Dang . 
Yeah Searcy ! Way to take out those Pioneers ! 
I still cannot speak properly . I think last night was a success . :D 
Curses . Rice admissions people are giving a presentation in LR the same day as the Journey concert . What's more important , college or Journey/Foreigner/Night Ranger ?... yeah , I'm going to the concert . Rice can deal . 
High up above or down below\ 
When you're too in love to let it go\ 
But if you never try you'll never know \ 
Just what you're worth\ 
Tears stream down your face\ 
When you lose something you cannot replace\ 
Tears stream down your face and I\ 
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes\ 
Lights will guide you home\ 
And ignite your bones\ 
And I will try to fix you 
I sure wish I had my music so I could practice , this one weekend when I have nothing to do . * glares at you altos * 
September 11 . Never forget . 
Loving you isn't the right thing to do \ 
How can I ever change things that I feel ? \ 
If I could , baby I'd give you my world \ 
How can I , when you won't take it from me ? \ 
You can go your own way , go your own way \ 
You can call it another lonely day \ 
You can go your own way , go your own way . 
is wearing pink today . I thought that was cause for a status . 
Unstoppable force + immovable object = typical Mayes question . 
It's always a pleasant surprise when < PROPMALE > Baird sneaks up behind you and starts singing \Seasons of Love\ " in your ear . ^_^ " 
Yellow dress is yellow . And pretty . ^_^ 
should really start studying for the first APUSH test . Since my \Seasons of Love\ " CD doesn't work . >.<" 
Read through the first of five APUSH chapters ! Yeah ! * groan * 
Two finished !... boo this . I'm done for the night . 
My Boston tape died . Sad day . But I found a tape of a < PROPMALE > and Garfunkel concert , FTW ! 
Empty 8gig . Battery charging . G11 ready . I cannot say how TOTALLY EXCITED I am for tomorrow's Journey/Foreigner/Night Ranger concert !!! 
If I can just make it through today . 
If I can just make it through school today . 
Cruising down the highway with my < PROPMALE > and Garfunkel , watching the sunrise , wondering how this day could possibly get any better . Then I saw the rainbow . :) 
See ya , Searcy ! Off to see Night Ranger . And Foreigner . AND JOURNEY !!! 
What I'm missing is true emotion , \ 
I get lost in this digital ocean . \ 
What I'm needing right now is human feel . \ 
Can't substitute love and passion . \ 
Show me you care , baby show me reaction . \ 
Coming straight from the heart , it's human feel . \ 
JOURNEY !!! 
Commitment's just a word\ 
You could've wrapped your heart around\ 
It's your foolish pride and freedom\ 
Got you standing your ground\ 
A leap of faith , another chance\ 
What if you can dance ? \ 
Once you let someone love you\ 
You'll find out an open door\ 
A place in your heart you've never been before\ 
Believe it's never too late\ 
For someone to set you free\ 
Once you let someone love you 
\It's probably good to park close to the forum so we don't get kidnapped and raped on the way to and from the car . \ " -- Madre " 
AT THE FEDEX FORUM . CANNOT WAIT UNTIL 7 . 
Night Ranger is sooooo amazing ! I think that's the first time I've heard a \Don't Tell Me You Love Me \"/\" Hotel California\ " mashup ... you can STILL rock in < PROPFEMALE >!!!" 
FOREIGNER . YES . He's no < PROPFIRST > Gramm , but dang , < PROPFIRST > Hansen sure can sing . 
OH MY GOD I AM SO IN LOVE WITH ARNEL PINEDA RIGHT NOW . 
Well . 1:20 , and we're finally home . Tomorrow ... well , today , I guess ... is gonna be lots of fun on four hours of sleep . But the concert was soooooo worth it . 
Goodnight , world . :) 
What's four hours of sleep ? I got this . Bring it , Thursday . 
Me and my Journey shirt , setting out to conquer Thursday . On four hours of sleep . 
And I'm left wondering how you can still be so clueless . 
Here's hoping < PROPFEMALE > doesn't kill me for missing yesterday's alto rehearsal . 
Physics kind of owns my life right now . One of these days I'll get it figured out . 
Physics kind of owns my life right now . 
When you learn to lose\ 
You'll know what it takes to win\ 
Wanna go the distance\ 
With a hunger that never ends\ 
When you want to prove\ 
You're the best that's ever been\ 
They can knock you down\ 
You're on your feet again\ 
' Cause you know what it takes\ 
What it takes to win 
Summer , why didst thou leave me ?! 
At the stadium . It's really nasty out here , wet and cold . But there shall be band dancing , so it'll get better . :D 
Are ANY not-bandies planning on showing up to the game ? 
Way to be , Searcy ! Three for three so far . You guys are great ! 
Yup , already awake again , as of five this morning . 
JDRF Walk to Cure Diabetes ! 
So glad that I got to see < PROPFIRST > Wolf and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > today ! 
Sleep is a beautiful thing :) except for the part when I fall asleep in the middle of a text conversation , sorry Kimmi ... 
You know what ? I miss dial-up Internet . At least it stayed connected . Dumb fickle wi-fi . 
So apparently two tabs of Facebook and one window of pictures are too much for the computer to handle . How am I supposed to do anything on it ?! 
Love that it's taking half an hour just to get out of Internet . 
READ THIS . \ 
http://www.bidstrup.com/marriage.htm 
Feel like I've passed the point of no return now that we've been taught the coefficient of friction . I'm a true physics student now . 
Don't go through life livin ' down on love . 
is feeling a huge respect for everyone who had/has to take physics , cal , chem , APUSH , and English ( the AP ones ) in the same year and somehow managed to survive . 
What a pleasant weekend . But now everything starts back again . For some reason , I'm getting this sinking feeling that it's gonna keep doing that . 
Wishing I could hear you sing again . 
Well , I won't back down\ 
No , I won't back down\ 
You can stand me up at the gates of hell\ 
But I won't back down\ 
No , I'll stand my ground , won't be turned around\ 
And I'll keep this world from draggin ' me down\ 
Gonna stand my ground\ 
And I won't back down\ 
( I won't back down)\ 
Hey baby , there ain't no easy way out\ 
( And I won't back down)\ 
Hey I will stand my ground\ 
And I won't back down 
Trying out for a \Seasons of Love\ " solo for the Homecoming Assembly tomorrow . Want one like nobody's business . Even if they are all mean and soprano-y . Wish me luck ! " 
Curse you , Dr. Smith ! Do you realize how long it's been since I've done long division ? :P 
The WCMC gift shop just bought 25 Jeangles to sell ! So excited ! P.S. They're still around if you want to get your own ! $10 , and all profits go to the Cancer Center ! 
I'll love you more for one honest statement than for a thousand pretty lies . 
Let's try this again . Perhaps solo auditions will be today . But no guarantees . 
heard \The Final Countdown\ " when I turned on the radio this morning . Maybe I can fight through today . :) " 
When Jr. High quiz bowl practice is your respite , you know you need a life . 
Celebrating Singles Awareness Week :D 
Not happy with the end of the Mentalist premier . Pretty disappointed . 
I miss summer . 
Come on Lions , let's make it 4-0 !!! And band , you guys sound GREAT from a distance ! 
Soooo close . Great effort , guys . You'll get it next week ! 
How can I , when you won't take it from me ? 
The kid next door is playing \The Lion Sleeps Tonight\ " on clarinet . " 
Charcoal-grilled , bacon-wrapped , jalapeño-stuffed grouse FTW . 
Yeah , sure , don't reply . After all , that is the most effective comeback for when I've clearly won the discussion .

Rice . :) 
Sick of trying . >.< 
Weekend , why you no last long enough ?! 
\You just used ' slinky ' as a verb ! \"" 
Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard\ 
And you laughed in my face cause you held the cards . 
Thank you , Mayes . Just throw a bunch of terms and equations that we've never seen before at us and expect us to do ridiculous problems with them . Yup . Works real well . No pun intended . 
Remember those days when you had a 9:30 bedtime and it was actually possible to get your homework done by then ?... yeah , I don't , either . 
just went all * cute baby squee ! * over a snake hatchling . 
Hunter : \Physics lesson ! Why did I take off my watch ? \ " \ 
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes , \ 
Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan . \ 
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes ; how\ 
Do you measure the life of a woman or a man ? \ 
In truth that she learned , or in times that he cried ? \ 
In bridges he burned , or the way that she died ? \ 
It's time now to sing out though the story never ends . Let's\ 
Celebrate , remember a year in the life of friends ! 
Red and black day ? Hecks yes ! \ 
After calculus >.<
