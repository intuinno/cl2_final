I am AWFUL at memorization ... I'm scared . lol . 
However , when doing so , we should present mature ladylike behavior and understand that we are a team and that we are composed of all different types of people . Instead of cussing and screaming , maybe we should try to give encouragement and love . 
Never have I been so disgusted with something . We should all work together as a team and help each other . We should smile and give encouragement and set an example for cheerleaders younger than us . Yes , we should work out . 
When I first started to become interested in cheerleading back in seventh grade , I truly believed it was a positive sport . I thought it was something you could smile in , laugh in , work in , and grow into a better person . I was so wrong . Since when has it become okay for young girls to cuss and scream at each other because someone is having a hard time with intense ab workouts ?? 
Today was a great day ! :) 
:) 
snow ! :D 
Cheerleading competition ! :D is excited 
Best Christmas ever ! :) 
So I JUST found out there is no school tomorrow .... 
I see a spider web and it's me in the middle . So I twist and turn , here I am in my little bubble . I never meant to cause you trouble . I never meant to do you wrong . Well , if I ever caused you trouble , I never meant to do you harm . Trouble --- Coldplay 
The sky could fall , could fall on me . But you mean more , mean more to me , than any color I can see .
