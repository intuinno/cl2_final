it feels so right to be so wrong ... 

so you tried to put a fire out , but you used gasoline ... 
what are you doin ? im boooooored 
It feels like I'm jumping towards a train . 
I have built myself a structure deemed to fall and I can't get off of it . 
< PROPMALE > ferguson is on ! 
does anyone have any good arguments for or against utilitarianism ? 
It takes more than one person to decide what is fair . 
I have seven more hours to kill until my next class ! 
Ash to ash , and dust to dust . We're all going to die so we have to trust in something . No it might be nothing , but it's got to be something . 
hooray for fruity loops ! 
Everyone is guilty 
You ... Human Paraquat !
