Hubby , baby , and I slept thru midnight . Family home and safe and feeling somewhat better in our common cold . Priceless . Enjoy the noise while we enjoy the peace and quiet . Happy New Years ! 

is traveling to Friendswood to have her vision checked and possibly get a shot in her left eye . Please , have your vision checked yearly because the earlier you find a eye problem , the less icky the treatment is . 
I sworried because < PROPFIRST > is running a slight fever and is congested . Dady switched scheduled so he can take him in to doctor tomorrow . Nothing serious , most likely , just a cold , but only child of two 30-somethings so , he goes to the doctor . 
Dad just got out of ER . Ge either gad bad drig interaction or beginnings of brochitis . He got some sleep . Honet got an hour and is a little loopy . THey are going to oxygen place and then back to hotel for some more sleep . They will get a laye start to 
Dad is doing much better . He's ready to leave the hospital already . The doctor has convinced him to stay a while to make sure he's okay . They are working on thinning his blood right now . Thank you for all your thoughts and prayers . And , a big WOOOO H 
My office is moving . I am in the old office while they slowly take away every bit of technology we have , uncluding my magnifer on Wednesday . Breathe , just breathe . New office has the technology . Breathe . 
We are home . < PROPFIRST>'s surgery went very well . He now has a thumb on each hand . He was born without on on his left hand . His left hand now has 3 fingers and a thumb . He had surgery around 11:30 AM and was released home at 4:30 PM . We got home around 7PM . Thank you for all your thoughts , prayers , energy , mojo , whatever you call it , thank you ! 
Children are incredibly resilient . < PROPFIRST > is back to running around the house . He seems aware that there is something different about his hand but he isn't certain what . 
Had to take < PROPFIRST > to the ER at Texas Childrens ' Hospital yesterday afternoon . The splint was too tight on his fingers . It was the most pleasant visit to an ER ever . We were in and out in under one hour . We called his surgeon who had someone come down immediayely when we got there . < PROPFIRST > is up an running this morning . Fingers are less swollen and the purple tint in his knuckles is gone . 
8PM Thursday night , < PROPFIRST > got out of his splint . We took another trip to TX Childrens ' . 6AM Friday , we headed home with a new hard cast . This morning , he hit the cast just right and it popped off . Seems it wasn't bent enough to keep it on . This time , we went to Baptist Hospital in Beaumont . < PROPFIRST > charmed everyone . 2 hours later , he had a new splint . Be careful , my darlings ! I can't take much more . 
Hello , everyone ! Been busy . Mom and Dad are in their own home . My house has settled back into its normal choatic rhythm . 
Life is good . I have spent the entire day with my family-both the one I was borne into and the one I have acquired through my life . Not everyone is here but they know they are missed and loved , so it's all good . I am blessed and loved . Happy Thanksgiving ya'll! 
The only thing worse than having a doctor stick a needle in your eye to try to save your vision , you ask ? Jerking and having it pierce your cornea . Yeah , it's that kinda day . Have to go back tomorrow to see ( lol ) if I need surgery to repair the cornea in my good eye . 
No cornea surgery . Yes ! Big floater which decided to detach and keeps messing with vision . Nooo ! Alive and well . Okay , I'll abide . Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers and postive energy and whatever got me through the day . 
I am in the < PROPMALE > of men tonight . Game night at the Shosty's . Or , is it Shosti ? < PROPFIRST > is asleep and I hear the sound of grown men laughing . Life is good .

< PROPFEMALE > ? Are you there ? I will not stop poking you . You will crumble eventually . ( I hope you cam hear me lauhging as I typing this ;) 
The nice part about being home sick ? The computer doesn't care if you sneeze or cough . But then , it doesn't care if you're wheezing or just plain can't breath . Everything has it's limitations . 
Feeling better today . I think I can make it to woek tomorrow . I can breath and my sides don't hurt so much . < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ( and < PROPFEMALE > ) are doing better as well . 
Going back to work . Feel like crap but I'm going . I can make it one day and then rest over the three day weekend . I think I can , I think I can ... 
Alrigh , now ! I challenged < PROPFEMALE > to a poke war , not a bunch of you . Get your own poke war < PROPMALE > .

I had lunch with a baseball bat in your bathroom because I'm cool like that . 
Both of you . You know who you are . Stop it ! Stop it right now or I will pull over this car . . . ;) 
Happy birthday to you ! Happy birhtday to you ! Happy Birthday , dear < PROPFIRST > ! Happy birthday to you ! My son is two years old today . Where has two years gone ? He has hair and teeth . He walks and talks , ok , babbles . He throws fits . Oh , dear God , does he throw the fit . He laughs and smiles so honestly that it makes you smile and laugh even though you don't know the cause other then he's happy . 
Friday ! Ah , Friday ! 
Up way too late . Tomorrow is our tenth anniversary . We are having lunch with our son . His treat , go figure ! 
Okay , time for college pictures , or pictures of you right after high school . This one is < PROPFEMALE > and I at Spring Formal at Our Lady of the Lake University in San < PROPFIRST > , TX . I don't think I've worn anything sleeveless since . 
the recliner by the computer 
Going to the boats with parents and sister . Wish us luck ! 
I need bricks , nails , and boards for my barn in Farmville . 
< PROPFIRST > had a nightmare . So , a fresh diaper , half a bottle and some gentle rocking to get him back to sleep . Now , Momma is awake . 
is loving being a Mom . < PROPFIRST > wakes up and comes to find me wherever I am . I left one morning before he woke up . He kept pointing at the door until I came home . A couple days ago , he insisted on going with my spouse to pick me up from work . 
How to celebrate having Presidents ' Day off , you ask ? Why , by playing morning Bingo with my parents . 
The only bad thing about a three day weekend is going back to work . Tuesdays make horrible Mondays . 
We are staying in < PROPMALE > tomorrow night as < PROPFIRST > has a very early appointment at Texas Childrens ' Hospital . No worries , just time to run some tests again . We will leave after work . 
We are home . To prove he is my child , his left side is all better but his right side has worsened . No surgery right now . Observe and wait to see if right side self-corrects within the next year . 
Today's Game : Place of Birth : Everyone please play ! You will find it interesting to know where your FB friends birth places are . Copy to your profile , then put your place of birth at the end of this sentence .... Vineland NJ . It's in southern Jersey . 
< PROPFIRST > is congested , again . No fever but he hacks up a lung every hour or so . Nebulizer to the rescue . 
< PROPFIRST > has crup and Loius is sickly . Home taking care of my two men . 
< PROPFIRST > has crup ( imflamationof the throat ) and hubby is sickly as well , so I am home for the day . My throat itches . I think ( with every fiber of my being ) that it is sympathy pain . < cough > I am tired of living in the Plague House . 
Going to see my parents new pool . Ah !!!! Oh !!!! Floating on the weekends . 
Quiet weekend at home with my men . I can hear both of them snoring . Life is very , VERY good .

Hypnos and Morpheus are calling . They miss me . Tomorrow , I mean , today is Ladies Night , Yes , there will be a picture of Bingo-related things sent via multimedia . 
I must take issue with the term ' a mere child , ' for it has been my invariable experience that the company of a mere child is infinitely preferable to that of a mere adult . < PROPFEMALE > Lebowitz ( 1950 - ) 
Multimedia message 
Citizen Shosty returning for jury duty . Let's hope if I'm pick for a court again today , the plantiffs actually show instead making me return in the afternoon just to be dismissed for the day and told to return two days later . I am willing to serve . The dumbass system is bringing me down . Thinking positive . I am a shining light for the becon of < PROPFEMALE > . 
Got selected as a potential jury for criminal court and then got released from duty as all defendants pled guilty . Since none of us were actually picked as jurors , we can be summoned again at any time . I am still shiny , though . Oh , yeah . . Bingo with Mom tonight . Shiny and happy person coming through ! 
Have you ever wondered what the worl would be like without elbows ? 
Late to work . Monday strikes again . 
Back to work . Smiling as I look at profile picture and realizing I have it pretty good . 
Work sucked . Left early . Hubby and son let Momma rest . Almost midnight and I'm starting to feel like myself . 
is green with envy and looking forward to pictures if her sister's road trip . Still , I get flowers and lunch with son and hubby today , so I think I'll pull though . 
Ironman II was awesome ! Better than the first . 
Going to Relay for Life with Mom . 
Saturday went well . On to Sunday . 
Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that the Rebel Alliance is a band of terrorist scum . The Empire only wants to bring peace to the galaxy but these rebels continue to kill our brave brothers in white . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make this your status for one hour ? 
Staying in hotel in < PROPMALE > Thursday night so we don't have to drive 1 1/2 hours in rush hour just to sit in a plane for another 3 hours . Arriving Friday afternoon in Philly and staying with Aunt Bootsie in Jersey . Jacobson's on Saturday . Pastre's on Sunday . Monday is still open . Leaving Tuesday at noon . Not enough time . Hubby alone for Fathers ' Day . Too much time away . 
Up and ready to travel to the Jacobson homestead . Now , where's < PROPFIRST>'s shoes ? 
I was told the scary libarian look was , well , scary . Here ;s a happuer profile pciture . 
\William 
got home and slept . Hubby and Maw Maw played with < PROPFIRST > for hours and then took me out to dinner . Going back to bed now . Probably dream of the Jersey shore . At least there's a breeze . 
Back to work . Wonder how many emails I got in three work days ? 
Sometimes , the Universe kicks you in the butt to get you moving . My garage is organized and < PROPFIRST>'s big boy bed is in our room . I wonder what it is like to sleep without a 2 year old on your head ? I am so excited ! 
Ok , so big boy experiment ( read not going so well ) continues . I know , it takes time . < PROPFEMALE > , as I tell my son . Does anyone know what it is like to wake up with a child wrapped around your head saying \Milk ? \ " I still do . He is so adorable . " 
House is quiet . I should be in bed but mind keeps going . Stacks of stuff to do at work , sister's birthday coming up , and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > flying in this weekend , Family , I am part of a huge , lovely family ! 
It is good to be silly ! 
Sometimes it's good to be calm . 
Silly with a < PROPMALE > of a good night's sleep . 
New profile picture in living color . Not so blotchy . A little rough but not bad for 1:30 AM . 
I have a PC compatible camera and a < PROPMALE > computer . I have wonderful pictures of < PROPFIRST > making a special cake and no way to upload them 
went to see Despicable me with husband and niece . It was wonderful . < PROPFIRST > spent time with Maw Maw . 
Came home early . Digestive system acting up again . Felt tired all day . tomorrow is another day . 
Getting an early start this morning . Will wonders ever cease ? I hope not . 
I went to the doctor who spoke to me for a little while and then sent in the trained vampire . She got a vein in one shot . Woo Who ! 
Visited the Bookish Pelican in Bacliff . My in-laws have stuff there . < PROPFIRST > went crazy popping balloons . Hilarious ! 
Left home without my purse ( wallet , drivers ' license , cell phone , chapstick ) . I was a mess . Thankfully , I live less than 5 minutes from work , so I had lunch at home and brought it back . Amazing how one item ( full of items ) can throw off your day . 
I need to go to bed . I want to go to bed . Here I am , still on the computer . < Sigh > If my mind would just accept that my body is tired . . . 
My son did not eat dinner last night . Later , he wanted ice cream . He got the carton and brought it with a spoon to his grandma . She did not think he should have it since he had not eaten dinner and that he needed to ask me . I said no for the same reason and asked if he wanted dinner . He did no . So , while I thought he was with Grandma , and she thought he was with my husband , and my husband took a shower , 
Monday , Monday . . . 
Yes , < PROPFIRST > , Mommy was young once . And , so was Aunt < PROPFEMALE > . 
I will be forty years old in one week and a day , < exhale > Yeah , I'm good . 
Looking forward to Friday . There is a surprise waiting for me . My husband is planning something . Anyone want to tell me what it is ? 
It's my birthday ! Thank ya'll for all the well-wishing . I can feel the love . 
< PROPFIRST > did very well at Shriner's yesterday . His thumb is working as expected and they want to see him again in 6 months to see if bones in wrist have hardened so they can see if any are missing . Why does a docotr telling you your child is doing well make you feel better ? 
Saturday overtime . There goes the weekend . 
I was spending the weekend in < PROPFEMALE > with hubby . I remember waking up and wandering out to the living room . It was a beautiful day . I looked at the TV and I asked my father-in-law what movie he was watching . He told me what had happened , and I asked him for a cigarette . It was the last time I started smoking . I was never so happy to be in < PROPFEMALE > as I was that day . 
Who woke up at 5AM with a back ache ? Raise your hands .

Monday , Monday , So good to me . 
I had my first mammogram last night . I was rather concerned as I am a DDD and I had heard horror stories . Let me assure you , the technology has greatly improved . They no longer have to make a pancake of your breast to get a good picture . You do have to embrace a ma < PROPFEMALE > e and make sure your < PROPFEMALE > is out of the picture , but it was not bad at all . A little uncomfortable , but no bad . I was done in under 20 minutes . 
Still sleepy . Need to stay up a little longer so I sleep all night . 
Back pain . So bad I want to cry . Come on Vicodon and prescription strength Ibuprofen . 
Better this morning . Actually able to pick up < PROPFIRST > without wincing . Have to pace myself . It might be the pain medicine talking . 
Return to Plague House . < PROPFEMALE > feels warmed over . < PROPFIRST > crashed early afternoon . < PROPFIRST > lit up like a candle . My throat itches . Plague House sucks . 
< PROPFIRST > is still a little warm but back to his cheery self . Nothing like a child with a temp saying , \I sick\ " to make you feel helpless as you wait for the tylenol to kick in . Beaumont is sunnier today . I will not jinx anything as we are still in Plague House mode . "

No luck on costume . No pictures . 
Saw RED last night . Funny . Great . Go and see it .

< PROPFIRST > wants his < PROPFEMALE > . 
Friday , sigh , dear friend . 
A rainy election day in Beaumont . 
Hoping we can get < PROPFIRST > into eye doctor this morning . It's hard to watch someone you love in pain and there is nothing you can do but wait . 
My son is chirping in my ear . Or , is he talking to the dolphins in California ? Or , maybe , he is counseling the space monkeys again . NOISE is the key . 
I'm a touch and go woman . 
One sickly beastie I be , being taking care of by my hubby ! 
What is better than being home sick ? Being at work well . And , I'm not just kissing up to my fellow co-workers . I would much rather be there than have stomach trouble . Sucks . 
I'm just a < PROPMALE > , Yes , I'm only a < PROPMALE > , And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill . Well , it's a long , long journeyTo the capital city , It's a long , long waitWhile I'm sitting in committee , But I know I'll be a law someday ... At least I hope and pray that I will , But today I'm still just a < PROPMALE > . 
Not feeling good this morning . Bucking up though . Office Christmas party tonight and visiting Broussard's Saturday . No time for stomach trouble . < Stomp > 
The wind is howling . Tomorrow should be great potato soup weather . Too bad the chicken is already marinating for SOur Cream Chicken . Maybe Tuesday . 
TGIF ! 
< PROPFIRST > has learned how to take his picture using Photobooth . He is good at taking pictures of the top of his head . Current profile picture is a < PROPFIRST > original . 
Do you know what happens when your almost three year old son has an absolute fit when he cannot open the presents he saw at his grandparents ' home ? Mom and Dad thank God they hadn't put out any presents at home . Blessings of procrastination and mercy abound ! 
Yes , < PROPFIRST > liked < PROPFEMALE > this year . He went running over to him . 
Last day of this year to work . And , the return of Ladies Nights Out with Mom means Bingo . 
Spouse is making potato soup tonight and mother-in-law is making chicken pot pie tomorrow . I love cold weather . 
We are celebrating MLK Hr Day with a stomach virus a la < PROPFIRST > . Nothing to bring a family to together like vomit . I needed to wash those sheets today anyway . He and < PROPFIRST > are resting on the couch . < PROPFIRST > kept down some water o no trip to the E/R so far . 
< PROPFIRST > is feeling \much better . \ " Thank you all for your birthday wishes for him . We are planning on having something this weekend but it depends on what the doctor says today . Probably a urinary tract infection . Not strep which is making its appointed rounds . " 
WHo ;s up at 4AM baking a birthday cake ? Why , I am , of course . < PROPFIRST > is 3 years old and feeling much better . Still have no idea what caused the week of nausea and I am glad to see it go . 
Going to Ladies Night at Sutherland's tonight with Mom . Bring on the home improvement demonstration and freebies ! 
< PROPFEMALE > weather 
Do you know what sucks ? FInding out you hogged the computer all day by reading your husband's blog . Instead of , maybe your husband telling that you he needed on the computer to post his blog . God , it must be awful to find out what your spouse is thinking online . 
So , feeling much better after a fenagrin-induced coma . < PROPFIRST > still has a bit of congestion . Think I might actually make it to work tomorrow . 
< PROPFIRST > has the flu and strep . Doctor told < PROPFIRST > that < PROPFIRST > was the 6th kid that he saw yesterday that had both . Hubby and mother-in-law are both sickly . I have a cough this morning . \I am well . . . I got a flu shot . . . I am well . \"" 
The Shosty House is now full Plague . I have a sore throat and a dry cough . A trip to the doctor and a bundle of medications . < PROPFIRST > is resting comfortably on the couch . < PROPFIRST > is on laptop writing . Peace broken by sporadic coughs and sniffles . 
Feeling not so good in a general kind of way . time for work . 
banana 
Monday , monday Ba da da da da . . 
I need to sleep . Ok , I'm going back in . Wish me luck . 
Never thought I'd be happy that my son was average . When he was born , he was 7 weeks early , weighed 3 lbs 6 oz , and was 16 3/4 inches tall . He was in the lower 20th percentile at his 1st birthday . Yesterday , he weighed 32.6 lbs and is 38 inches tall . He is now 3 years old . He is in the 50th percentile . Yeah , average ! 
Will I or will i not be picked for jury duty ? We'll see . 
I was picked to come back tomorrow and see if I am picked to be on a jury for 60th District Civil Court . Winning !
