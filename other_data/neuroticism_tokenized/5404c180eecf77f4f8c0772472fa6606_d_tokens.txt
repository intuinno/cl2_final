Influecing th Engligh language on mispelling at a < PROPMALE > ! 

Just woke up ... needs to regulate sleep cycle very badly . 
wondering if it would be too risque to depict a pope , a Tibetan monk , and a rabbi under autopsy for < PROPFEMALE>'s assignment . 
\Bull shit makes the flowers grow \"" 
Libertarianism without spirituality is a recipe for disaster 
cell phone got sent through washing machine . contact information probably lost . could everybody please tell me their phone < PROPFIRST > again ? 
My phone crawled to safety and is still alive , although it is very badly disfigured 
Laughing gas does not live up to its name . 
¿ ? s ? p ? u ????? ? ???? u ???? ? s ? ??? 
Stayed up late finishing the movie . At 1 hour , 3 minutes , it's technically feature length . :) 
The screening went SO well . :) I'm very happy . 
Oh my GOD I am flipping out , literally jumping with excitement because I just read one of < PROPFEMALE>'s textbooks for college , it's about the artistic process and combines all my favorite philosophers in quotes that build upon my worldview and I WANT IT SO BAD ! I go \squee\ " when I read textbooks ... does that make me strange ? " 
Saw < PROPFEMALE > off tonight at U of M < PROPMALE > . 
Mahatma Gandhi , as you know , walked barefoot most of the time , which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet . He also ate very little , which made him rather frail ; and with his odd diet , he suffered from bad breath . This made him .... :D A super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis . 
Transferring all files from iMac to macbook , preparing to move to New York City tomorrow . 
Is in New York ! 
Is all moved into Weinstein hall . Tired as hell . 
OH MY GOD UPSTEIN HAS BREAD BOWLS ! 
doesn't have access privileges to his own computer ! >:( 
Will get access to his own hard drive if it kills him ! 
Just shook hands with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Hoffman ! Just sitting on the street ! ... BTW my new laptop crashed the other day , and is in the shop . So I'm unplugged . 
Computer fixed , works better than ever . I'm back online ! :) 
It's a quiet , dreary , rainy , cold , lonely , and sad , sad day in New York City on Friday , September 11 . 
Among many other things , wants to see Drag me to Hell on Halloween at MOMA for free . 
Feels like he's moving BACKWARDS intellectually in Liberal Studies . :( Except in Mr. Thometz ' < PROPFEMALE > class , which rocks . 
Couldn't find that LSP productions thing . Got thoroghly lost and missed it completely . F *** my life . 
The Book of Job = The Dark Knight 
There are so many blank spaces in The Epic of Gilgamesh that I could play Mad Libs with it , just for laughs . For starters : Pick a number , a body part , and a very hairy Noun ! 
Is torn between doing his homework , which is simply to read < PROPFEMALE > as if it were fiction rather than history (* snore * I did that the FIRST time I read it ); and doing his own thing by composing a comprehensive lesson plan about the relationship between 2001 : a Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange and what the 2 films might have to say about our real-life 21st century experience . WHAT DO I DO ? 
Has just rediscovered Zoroastrianism again ; Just realized that the battle between < PROPFEMALE > and Druj , creation and un-creation , good and evil , life and death , experience and nothingness , existence and non-existence ... is already won , as , by definition , non-existence does not exist . 
It's Ghandi's birthday today 
Just realized how much he Really misses Perpich :( 
FINALLY watched Let the Right One In . And oh my God . 
The pope abolished the concept of Limbo ? Come on ... how low can you go ? 
Trick ' r Treat came out on DVD today ! 
Just got Trick ' r Treat in the mail ! 
is very sick ... :( 
I'm hot-blooded , check it and see . I got a low-grade fever of 100.3 
I just found ou that Trick ' R Treat is screening in New York tonight . < PROPFIRST > Dougherty is there to discuss it . I'd have gotten tickets in spite of being sick , and I'd have had the time of my life ... if not for the fact that the screening STARTED fifteen minutes ago . FML . :( :( :( 
Campbells soup has like a hundred different chicken noodle soup recipes , which are all different and are seldom any good . 
The word INVENT comes from Latin INVENIRE which means to FIND . This proves that nothing is ever invented , rather it is always DISCOVERED . Ideas are the geology and the geometry of the universe . They are ancient buried things like dinosaur skeletons , not the fabrications of men or women . Ideas are not constructed , they are revealed ! 
Marched in the New York City Halloween parade last night and had tons of fun . 
New word : Maneurysm . Help me come up with a definition for it . 
woke up at 8:30 . I'm officially diurnal again thanks to Monk . 
New < PROPFEMALE > = a loony phase 
\Is this the end of Zombie Shakespeare ? \ " —Zombie Shakespeare " 
Series finale of Monk : A great ending to a great show . Simply wonderful . :) 
It's snowing in New York City 
LOL , < PROPFEMALE > Taymor is directing the Spider-Man musical . 
Clash of the Titans Remake = God is dead 
would have gone home today , but the flight was canceled ; has to stay in NYC for three more days . 
TAO-AWESOME 
is finally back in Minnesota 
A person in < PROPFEMALE > lives closer to a person in Egypt than a person in Washington lives to a person in Florida . The United States ought not be considered one country . 
is staying up very late , waiting for video files to render and disk images to save , etc . 
shaved his beard and now sports a pair of ridiculous sideburns 
has come back to work on < PROPFEMALE>'s farm some more :/ 
spent all the money he has in this world on drugs ... ... You know , of the \keeping me healthy\ " variety . " 
\Oh yeah ... the Beatles and Motown ... I got them confused . \ " —Guy Macarol at 3:22 in the morning " 
Lost the button that he made at the vis picnic , on the last day of school at PCAE ; Is now thoroughly depressed . 
\As the World Burns\ " = FUCK YES " 
You can't make a brainchild without two brainparents , therein lies the importance of collaboration . 
is the kind of crazy person who meticulously keeps journals , and fills them up with Esoteric flowcharts , Alchemy symbols , and cross-reference diagrams of Kabala and applied psychology , not to mention Anarchistic rants . 
deviantart message center redesign ... messing with my head . 
Blizzard in New York today , for some reason everybody freaked out and then they cancelled school . Something the locals call a \snow day . \ " Not a term I encountered much back in MN . " 
Can't remember his social foundations teacher's name ; Knows it's \Doctor\ " something ... But WHO ? DOCTOR * WHO *???" 
I think all my sleeping troubles and insomnia in the last 18 years can be linked to the fact that once , in the 90s I drank a bottle of Surge . 
Talked to 3 < PROPMALE > ists selling their work in Union Square Park today . 1 . Young man selling acrylic paintings on hand-stretched canvases . Does great work , but never been to < PROPMALE > school . 2 . C < PROPMALE > oonist and comedian who is a graduate of MCAD . He came to New York to pursue stand-up and to acquire a literary agent . 3 . A successful children's book illustrator who spoke of the importance of going out and meeting individuals . 
Guy's world culture teacher : This is only the \biggning \"" 
Is tired and has a killer headache .... and 5 pages to write tonight . 
I AM A PIANO ! DIONG DIONG DIONG ! 
Prisencolinensinainciusol , Oll Raigth ! 
Has a sore throat and can feel a cold coming on . 
social foundations midterm = ACED 
WHY IS THERE NO < PROPFIRST > JOHNS WITHIN 15 < PROPMALE > OF NEW YORK CITY ? I STILL CAN'T GET OVER THIS >:( 
thought his cold was getting better , but today it got much worse ... another sore throat . 
Fever : 100.2 
I've got a big bag of crabs here . I'm going to put them in my mouth . Oh , yes ! I'm going to run around the town on a market day , everyone will look at me and say I've got a mouth full of crab ! 
just got his ticket for An Enemy of the People . Great center seats for only twelve bucks . 
< PROPMALE > = Owned : J 
yesterday = food poisoning , repeated vomiting today = aches and pains , recuperating , sleeping all day 
An Enemy of the People was great ! I loved seeing it actually performed . The translation was very clear . I felt like I was seeing the story in its true form for the first time . For better or for worse , Dr. Stockman's story inspires me , as always , to fight against the status quo and argue for what I think is right . ( not like that's anything new ) 
Has given up on < PROPMALE > once and for all . I just don't have it in me . I'm changing my < PROPMALE > to sociology and I'm never looking back ! It's time to sell all my comics , throw out my used sketchbooks , and buckle down to get a REAL job ! 
Saw /The Magic Flute/ at the Metropolitan Opera as designed by < PROPFEMALE > Taymor ! I couldn't see very well because of the seats , and the Met's subtitling system is crappy , and they cut an important scene from the end ... But it was still pretty awesome ! 
He is risen ! 
The fifth dentist was the one who got it right . 
The weather is glorious and beautiful ! I'm going to the park ! 
Tat Tvam Asi and a Bag of Chips ! 
For my paper , I need to find examples to support my argument that modern society demands over-specialization , and that the world would be a better place if people learned as many different disciplines as possible . HELP ! 
went to a street fair and ate some LEGIT authentic Japanese ramen , the kind that's made by hand like in Tampopo , then I ate some Mexican flautas which were pretty good , and now I'm drinking a delicious mango and banana smoothie ... and saving room for some crepes . 
Just pulled an all-nighter making an absurd , improvised video project with my friend < PROPFIRST > Zhu ! 
Just got a new pair of shoes for the first time in over two years ! Same exact model as my previous pair , but they had worn down to a ludicrous degree ! Holes in the bottom and everything . I think i'm going to post comparison pictures just to show how much a beating they took ! :P 
sleep ... what is that ? 
HAHA ! I just wrote a twelve-page paper from scratch in under four hours . And it's good ! That's the good news . Bad news is it's six o'clock , so I won't be sleeping . And I have two MORE of these bad boys due TOMORROW . ... I hate you , NYU . 
* sigh * Here we go again ... i_i FML 
WHY IS THIS PAPER SO FUN TO WRITE EVEN THOUGH IT'S SIX AM ??? BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT The Natural Law Republic of Strøznia , THAT'S WHY !!!! 
now finds it hard to sleep the normal way , even though the final battle is over . 
Poland was the second country in the world to write a constitution . 
was already caffienated , sleep-deprived , and high on life ... THEN found out that it's FREE COMIC BOOK DAY ! New York Comic Book Stores here I come !!!! :D 
Every year , I get really excited for free comic book day , but then I'm painfully reminded of how much free comic book day comics SUCK . I find it hard to believe that comics this AWFUL ( uninteresting , poorly written , poorly drawn , cliched , stupid ) could be created ! D: The horror ... the horror ! 
is holding off on getting a haircut until May 15 . Then , I can cut it all off in a symbolic rejection of NYU : LSP and its arbitrary shit . In the meantime , I'm going to be focusing on even MORE homework . You know , to add to the signifcance of my future symbolic revenge . 
just ... four ... more ... days ! 
Maybe not today , and maybe not tomorrow , but some day ... maybe monday . Yeah , actually . Literally monday ... On monday I will be done with LSP . 
This year , I've read 10 holy books , 15 philosophical masterworks , and the works of 30 of the world's most inspired poets . And yet , none of these have motivated me as much as The Muppets Take Manhattan . 
FREE AT LAST ! FREE AT LAST ! \ 
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY I AM FREE AT LAST ! 
Is making some KILLER illustrations for < PROPMALE>'s Inferno !!! 
Is done making the killer illustrations for now . Now I have to find a way to turn the illustrations in to a teacher when the office building is locked up . Then I pack quickly and move to my new home five blocks away . 
Walking to 2nd street from University , I discovered a wall that was painted by < PROPFIRST > Harring ... Penises everywhere . 
Is waitlisted for all but one of his fall classes ... \ 
This translates to : \HOORAY ! I got one of my classes ! \"" 
Today I got a swastika tattoo , removed my shirt , and chased these two transvestites through central park with a baseball bat . \ 
\ 
... \ 
I love film school . 
Has convinced a large number of NYU staff that he is crippled , because he is always rolling around in a wheelchair < PROPFEMALE > ; Also , preparing to make an Iranian film tomorrow . 
Woooot . \Parallel Action\ " movie : FILMED . Editing : Tuesday . Tomorrow : Playing a narcissist who is obsessed with his reflection in a crewmate's \ " Character Development\ " movie . Non-stop work week . So very tired . :) " 
Well ... my parallel action movie is kind of a flop . You can have the best idea and the most interesting/complex sequences in the world ... but if you can't SEE any of it or tell what's going on ... well , damn . 
THE RYGCBM COLOR WHEEL DOESN'T MAKE ANY GODDAMN SENSE ! GIVE ME ROYGBV ANY DAY ! 
Has decided : He would rather struggle through poverty and anonymity ( if necessary ) as a < PROPFIRST > of All Trades , Master of None , than be a renowned One-Trick Pony . At least < PROPFIRST > is a Human being . It's time to change some things . 
I took a black cat , a cave bat , and threw them in a pot . I took a blue snake , a green snake , and tied them in a knot . \ 
I took a hog jaw , a dog's paw , and < PROPMALE > them on the line . \ 
I took a horse hair , a green pear , and made a crazy sign . 
I was surprized to find an artist's studio on Bond Street with the door open ( movers were taking boxes inside ) I walked a bit closer and was intrigued to see wall-sized paintings that looked to be made out of colored cells . I stepped inside and was astonished to see the back wheels of a wheelchair just around a corner . Today I found , entered , and got promptly kicked out of , < PROPMALE > Close's private studio ! 
turns 19 while pulling an all-nighter on his final film for sight and sound . At first , fears that there won't be enough time to even have a final film . But then , realizes this universal truth : Nobody can fail on their birthday ! 
It's nice to be back in MN . 
for the next 24 hours : Listening to theremin music and making a comic about a mad scientist . And hopefully a movie about one as well . 
After much deliberation has determined that when it comes to theme and style , < PROPMALE > Potter is Doctor Who with magic . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > VISITS STRØZNIA , AND THEN : FIREWORKS ON A BOAT ! HAPPY ( just past ) FOURTH OF JULY EVERYBODY ! :D 
Apparently I wrote \the best review ever\ " for a movie I've never even seen . " 
only two pages left :D 
I had a dream that I was hanging out with an old childhood friend . It got dark , and a lightning storm began . My friend got on his bike and went home . As he left , I looked into the sky to see a nearby radio tower being repetitively struck by a column of firey orange lightning . The radio tower had melted and collapsed from the stress . I went inside my house and saw that the event had made national news ... >>> 
... ... God Damn It 
< PROPFIRST > Svankmajer and < PROPFIRST > Darger are going my my \heroes\ " list . " 
is it bad to pull an all-nighter during summer vacation , when you're not doing any work ? 
Bored . What to do ... what to do ... 
Re-reading \Free PLay : Improvisation in Life and Art . \ " ... Again . < PROPFIRST > Nachmanovitch is absolutely brilliant . I'm off to practice my < PROPMALE >!" 
It's real < PROPFEMALE > outside and rainy too ... but it looks nice . Lots of cool grays . 
Is really , really sick . please wish me luck , all 
Hello all , I finally got access to the internet . I've been in the hospital all week . I got salmonella , which made my Crohn's Disease go crazy and I had to be rushed to the ER . I'm still stationed at St. < PROPFIRST>'s Hospital for the time being , but I've been getting better and they have told me that I will be able to come home tomorrow or the next day . 
I'm back home from the hospital !!!!! :D 
Hey < PROPFIRST > LaCosse , < PROPFIRST > Freiberger , have you guys given much consideration to getting your S&S films transferred to digital , yet ? 
Ah ! O God ! Sputum ! La peste ! ( typed work)\ 
is an anagram for , \Dudes ! Look at my great puppet show !! \ " \

BOOYAH !!! I JUST FACTORED SOMETHING ! WHO'S \OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT\ " NOW ??? "

HELLOOOO NEW YORK ! 
< PROPFIRST > McCloud is giving a freshman lecture .... FOR THE LIBERAL STUDIES PROGRAM ??? What , they save the only worthwhile thing for AFTER I transfer to Tisch ? 
:D HOLY SMOKES ! I got a voucher to attend the < PROPFIRST > McCloud lecture ! All I had to do was go to the LSP offices in person and ask nicely ! OMG ! 
is an all-around artist who is deeply invested in collaborating with other all-around artists to make a bunch of random shit to show everybody else and maybe convince them to become all-around artists too . 
Labor day ! Labor daaaay ! Schools are closed and POOLS ARE OPEN ! Labor day ! All the way !!!! do all your shopping .... \

Is off to Medieval Magic Class ! 
got to sit in on a life drawing class ( his first studio < PROPMALE > class in 14 months ) and man did it feel good to be back at the drawing table . 
' s dorm room window doesn't close all the way . This could be a PROBLEM . What do I do ? 
HAILSTORM ! :[ 
< PROPFIRST > Cage knew that Chaos ( i.e. the random sounds of traffic ) , as scary as is it is to some , is the * order * of NATURE . People get wrapped up in their ideas and think that if events lack manmade design there's something wrong . But nature has a design , too , even if you can't see it ; and when you step back & really LISTEN to chaos it makes perfect sense . Then you hear linear , rational \structure\ " and it seems fake . " 
Now my charms are all o'erthrown , \ 
And what strength I have's mine own , \ 
Which is most faint : now , ' tis true , \ 
I must be here confined by you , \

O ' Watermelon Juice . A full bottle in my fridge , you were my reason to come home . An empty bottle in my recycling bin , you are my reason to go out to the store once again . My guide , an engine of infinite change . 
< PROPFIRST > is jealous of my energy right now . 
On sunday-wednesday there's this huge education conference in Rockefeller Plaza , with a big exhibit open to the public and I intend to check it out . Anybody with me ? 
Got a super-8 camera on ebay for 99 cents , but it turned out to be a dud . I'm going to buy a screwdriver tonight and take it apart to see how it works . And afterwards , I will have knowledge and a 99 cent prop camera .

Supposedly the title of Transformers 3 is \Transformers : The Dark of the Moon . \ " \ 
Writing this script is like passing a fucking kidney stone ! I hate it but it still needs to happen . 
is leaving New York to visit family in < PROPMALE > , OH . Will be back Monday . 
completed his absentee ballot for MN — & voted on every office and EVERY issue after thorough , thorough , REALLY thorough research ! 
My report on the WPA & FAP was a wildly successful multimedia explosion . 
will play the game \Existence\ " to the end of the beginning " 
O_O This script I'm writing is supposed to be 8 pages . I've already written 5 pages about a single SCENE within this story . 
YES . I finally finished that one really long scene ! Now to move on to the REST of the script ! 
somehow turned an 8-page writing assignment into a 31-page script , and still has one scene left to go . 
LOVES OPENIG THINGS WITH REVERSE CLOSE-UPS 
I'm going to delete my little tanrum and simply say , in summary : I had a rough evening . I worked really hard on something and it didn't pay off . But I'm not going to let that ruin my Halloween . Halloween is , after all , the thing that REALLY matters . 
Today my medieval magic professor earnestly suggested that I retroactively drop her class . Because based on how I've done so far , I will probably fail regardless of how I do on the 20 < PROPFEMALE > research paper ( and prospects for that aren't good either ) . What sucks most is that I AGREE with her . * sigh * All things considered , the last four days might be the worst I've ever had . 
WHO IS THE BEST \SIGHT AND SOUND : DOC\ " TEACHER ? \ 
at time of writing Libertarians have 6% in indiana , Greens have 9% in South < PROPFEMALE > . Independents have 8% in rhode island . These are super impressive figures if you think about it . Plus an Independent governor candidate has essentially WON in Maine . and an Indie senator is second place in Florida . How cool that , when given the < PROPMALE > , ~ 1 out of every 15 Americans chooses to fight the 2-party ( one party ) system . 
I hope the one who is neither < PROPMALE > Emmer , nor < PROPFIRST > Dayton , will get\ 
mostvotes , but I will settle for him getting morevotes , because it's still\ 
pretty cool that he got anyvotes and it's amazing he got manyvotes rather than just somevotes . \ 
As long as Emmer loses and NotEmmer wins , the world is safe for a few more days . 
Goodnight everybody . \ 
Take it easy , after all . 
Slept from 8pm to 11:30 am O.o \ 
I guess I really needed it ! 
is bored , really bored , needs something better to do than debate people on the internet . what should I do ? 
completed an 18- < PROPFEMALE > script for a 13-15 < PROPFEMALE > script assignment . That's close enough , right ? RIGHT ??? D: 
is getting into the mood for Christmas RIGHT NOW . 
I called \the ex-wife\ " to tell her how I'm turning Skeleton Boy into a movie . She couldn't talk because she was hanging out with her new boyfriend . :| " 
IS FEELING HOSTILE AND ARROGANT . GRRRR OnO 
I HOPE THAT MY SCRIPT IS WELL RECIEVED BY ALL WHO LOOK AT IT 
Is anybody I know a publisher , or connected to a publisher in any way , even secondhand ?

Happy Thanksgiving everybody . 
Three words : Dark < PROPFEMALE > Sequel\ 
It's happening . 
Transformers : Prime ( the new TV show ) aired today , I watched it on YouTube , and it is actually really , REALLY good . WAY better than the movies . Orci and Kurtzman are now firmly on my list of \good writers\ " ... and < PROPFIRST > Bay now has a LOT more to answer for >:( " 
I snuck into < PROPFIRST>'s web design class and figured out how to change a clock that counts up by 1 from 1 into a clock that counts backwards by 2 from 9000 .

Is so bored that he'd like to rip his own eyes out and flush them down the toilet , just so he'd see something interesting .
