There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE . Getting back up is LIVING .
