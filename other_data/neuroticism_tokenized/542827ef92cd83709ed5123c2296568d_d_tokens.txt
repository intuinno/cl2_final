sez goodbye to a long and difficult ' 09 . 
: There are certain songs that are so badass they temporarily make you a notch cooler just by having them emanating from your vehicle ; \Low Rider\ " is one of these - making me a pimp in my plastic Saturn for approximately 4 minutes . "

has a terminally ill vehicle - anyone know a good place to get a car < PROPFEMALE > ? :(
