Time to buckle down and focus on maintaining that 4.0 gpa in Electrical Mechanics ... Mid-Terms ALREADY this week , Yikes ! Thanks God I'm smart ... Oh , and I know alot of stuff too ! LOL 
feels like pouting today , and feelin sorry for herself . It's been over a year now , and still she wants to break down everyday she doesn't hear from him ... 
Can't wait till class tonight to find out how I did on my 2nd Phase Mid-Terms ! Also I am looking for a job = anyone got a good plug on somewhere needing some really cute help ? LOL 
The Message was sent empty 
Got my Mid-Terms back for 2nd Phase Electrical Mechanics -- And I'm still Rockin ' the 4.0 GPA !! Now , if I could just land a job ...?

I'm struggling with being so Freakin Happy that I Finally Heard from the person who holds my heart and Being Crushed , Again , that were even farther apart than I thought we were yesterday ... Damn Him . 
The Truth Hurts . But there is no denying that I'm better off without all that than I am with it . I am forced to choose Happiness and Success-How's that for Karma/Fate/God's Will ?? I'm gonna be OK . 
I may not have it in me to act right , but I sure know how to get right -- because It's just wrong to be wrong , right ? Right !! 
Head up , shoulders back , smile on , lookin good , feelin ' better ... Amazing how GREAT it feels when you have no guilt , no regrets , and nothing to feel sorry for !!! God Bless Me , and God Bless All Of You Too !! 
I think I'm gonna put on the jeans that make my ass look smokin ' , the rockstar boots that make me look taller , and the attitude that makes me < PROPFEMALE > sexy , and go raise a lil ' HELL tonight !!!!!

school starts again on monday , i am officially off paper , and i have an interview tomo for a part time position in hutch ... now if i can just behave myself !! 
if you think i'm an awful human being and that i have forgotten about the favors you have done or risks you have taken on my behalf-i want to say to you i have not forgotten , and although my timing couldn't be more off i promise on everything that i love-which includes you by the way-that my debt will be paid and my gratitude will be shown . i'm trying , and that's the honest to goodness truth . 
note to self : always always go with your gut . Never Lies ... unlike man . AKA men , boys , dudes . fellas , pricks , etc . thanks self ! duly freakin noted . 
It's like this : This-or that . But not both . But no more waiting around for you to make up your mind ( or to run game ) . Grow a backbone and stand behind your choice with all the pride of a man who has a prize worthy of showing off . Keeping secrets = guilt and shame/fear of critisim , and ultimatly a bruised ego . 
Sooo-grateful I have the internet at school . Makes for an easy escape when The \Binary\ " chart gets a little redundant . " 
A wise man once said ........ There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it .. You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good ... So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't .. Life is too short to be anything but happy .. Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living ~ Re-post if you agree . gothca B 
Holy Moly I can't believe I just walked away from my first serious car accident ! I rolled my Honda Accord Around 3pm this afternoon 1 1/2 times and ended up on my side in a farmers field ! I only have a stiff neck and a bump on my noggin from the copper pipe I put in my car yesterday that I had forgotten all about till just then lol . Whew I don't want to do that again , No Bueno !! 
Midterms today .... Yuck . No ride for MegGuyver ... Yuck . Big Knot on my Dome ... Yuck ... Nobody to kiss it and make it feel all better ... Yuck . Worms for Lunch ... Yuck . 
so close yet so far away . i wish it was in the hearts of the ones who matter the most to make this temporary like an eternal love ... but love isn't to be forced , and it has no reasoning , it just is what it is -- and it can't be faked .
