The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds\ 
Strewn across a blue blanket\ 
I < PROPFEMALE > against the wind\ 
Pretend that I am weightless\ 
And in this moment I am happy ... happy 
Why am I awake at 6:00 A.M. ? -_- 
The man who can't be moved ... 
I raise my hands , bow my head\ 
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red\ 
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see\ 
Oh I believe 
What was left when that fire was gone ? \ 
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong . \
