For some reason the people in my building like stealing five year old Target clothes straight out of the washer . For some reason , this makes me want to kill them . 

Day off today ... Yes ! I'm going to party like it's on sale for $19.95 ! Or just bum around with < PROPMALE > .... whichever works . Anyone have anything fun going on tonight ? 
mmmmm .... Tuscan Linguine with tofu ... 
FINALLY reading House of Leaves . So far , so good . Any recommendations for a good book to read next ? 
Six blasts from the past came through my store today , making it a little brighter . Now if the snow could warm up enough for me to curl up and take a nap in it , it will have been a perfect day . =) 
Let's go get coffee and talk about all the superficial things that make life worth laughing at , anyone ? 
Dear Chicago , I'm afraid that it may be time for us to part ways . The truth is , you've been a fickle mistress through the years , and that's been OK , but lately you've just been loud , rude , selfish and dirty . I will always have a place in my heart for your bright lights and familiar places , and I hope we can keep in touch . <3 always , < PROPFEMALE > . P.S. Just stop being a jerk , city , and maybe we can talk this out ... 
Opening presents : funsies . Watching people open presents I got them : funsies with a side of tofu . ( That's a good thing ) Hope everyone is having a great Christmas < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ah ... it's actually Christmas now , so Happy Christmas to all ! I'm excited to go see Sherlock Holmes tonight ! =) 
There's something super satisfying about being lazy sometimes ... 
So , Paranormal Activity- actually a bit freaky . It's no exorcist , but ... 
Pawn Stars . So awesome . Plus it's nice to see anything on The History Channel that's not about the world ending . 
is not very good at planning things . I'm working on it though . 
Tomorrow I have an interview that matters . Wish me luck ! 
I like the sound of rain . 
I have a problem . I got to make up hours at work today by coming in 2.5 hours late and this upset me ... Seriously ... 
Can I go back to sleep ? Pretty please ? 
I don't like being sick . I hope I'm better by tomorrow , but this sore throat is hinting that it might put up a fight ... 
After watching Chaplin last night , my unnatural obsession with < PROPFIRST > Chaplin has been sparked again . I kind of <3 < PROPFIRST > . 
I used to have terrible acne . We're talking 2 pimples at a time here , people ( with photo evidence ! ) Until Proactiv . Since then I've become somewhat famous ( I was in a straight to DVD movie ! ) and EVERYBODY wants to have sex with me since I'm no longer a mutated freak ( and I don't even have to pay for it ! ) Also , < PROPFEMALE > can't sleep and may or may not have opinions about Proactiv infomercials . Just maybe ... 
I hate waiting . If only I could read minds ... or predict the future . 
Just watched The < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Story . People love this movie . < PROPFIRST > Busey's teeth scared/distracted me too much to tell . The parts where he didn't smile seemed enjoyable enough but I think I'll stick to reading BH biographies from now on . 
I'm jealous of everyone's awesome doppelgangers . Pooh . 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status and then copy and paste the first entry for your name under comments 
I have no problem keeping secrets , unless they're my own . 
Mmmmm ... Guacamole . I used to hate this gross looking green stuff . Now I like it . Sometimes . 
Orland Park , here I come ! I got my promotion and have an awesome SIM and a second car coming my way in the next couple of weeks . <3 < PROPFEMALE > , let's celebrate . SOON . 
Laaaazy day . =) 
does not feel like getting ready ... 4 closes this week . =( 
doesn't understand people at all . Say what you mean , and all will be well . Also , finally watched ( and loved ! ) ( 500 ) Days of Summer . 
Someone recommend a good movie ... 
Why are boys always hot ? I am freezing and < PROPMALE > is sweating . I officially love blankets . 
2 more days at Countryside ... I'm not sure how I feel about that . 
Best \Going Away\ " party a girl could ask for- I'm going to miss you Countryside ! :( " 
I have a huge bump on my forehead because I'm a klutz . Maybe I can act like I'm tough and got into a fist fight with Superman or something ... Is that believable ? 
:: sniffle :: sniffle :: sneeze . repeat . 
So sick , so sick of being tired . And oh so tired of being sick . Anyone feel like a text war ? 
I know I'm a geek , but I kind of love Lilo and Stitch . Also think I am FINALLY going to see < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland this weekend . 
I kind of want to take a nap ... I love that I only had to work two hours today , I got so much done ! On my way to Brixies soon ... 
Good times were had by all . Can't I just merge the Orland and C-Side stores together ? Maybe we just need to < PROPFEMALE > out more often . Southwest Side FTW !!! 
Having a weekend off ... pretty much the best thing ever . 
This weekend was a tease . I don't want tomorrow to be Monday . 
Orland Park , you're going to be awesome ! Installing a store is amazing , except for the bruises and weak muscles . 
wishes she could move her arms :/ My muscles aren't used to being used so much , haha . Maybe doing it all over again today will cancel out the hurt ... 
Everyone must shop at Half Price Books in Orland Park starting May 13 . Either that or bake me cookies . 
I feel like I've been having bad luck these last few days . Hmmm ... 
Dear Comcast- it's your fault I don't have cable or internet and yet you're still making me wait til WEDNESDAY to get it fixed !? 
I am super excited because I have cable and internet again . Turns out , Comcast disconnected everyone in my building to see how many of the tenants would call to complain about their legal cable connections being out . Turns out , we might have been the only people legally receiving it . According to the gentleman who came out today we're the only ones that have complained , and it's been out for about a week . Classy . 
gets to go back to work tomorrow ! If I can stay healthy for the rest of the year , that would be swell . =) 
If I sleep until 7am , I'm struggling to stay awake , yet somehow today I've been up since 3am and am not dying . Why , body ? Why ? 
Why didn't I watch Dead Like Me sooner ? 
1 ... 2 ... Freddy's coming for you ... 
< PROPFIRST > Brand as Drop Dead < PROPFIRST > ? Yes , please . 
Did I mention I love my job ? 
Today's the big day ! Anyone who loves books should check out the Half Price Books grand opening in orland park today ! It's right in front of the Orland Square Mall and it's open until 10 tonight . Did I mention coupons and awesomeness ? 
facebook.com/halfpricebooks= four groovy pictures of our Great Opening . Woot ! 
Hey , how about a post not related to Half Price Books ? Something about cool stuff that would blow your minds ? Something a little bit cooler than this ? 
Who wants a bike ? Also- can anyone make October come a little faster ? 
It would be really interesting to see a count of how many people we've ever met . I bet that number is pretty insane . Six degrees of seperation across the globe . 
I kind of want a panda . They're pretty much the cutest things ever . 
Things get more complicated when you're older \ 
\ 
before you know it you are somebody's soldier \ 
you get a gun and you name it \ 
after a girlfriend \ 
But I swear I'll never kiss anyone \ 
who doesn't burn me like the sun \ 
and I will < PROPFEMALE > every kiss \ 
like my first kiss \ 
<3 oh , Swedish pop <3 
It's pretty sweet having two days off in a row . The hard part will be dragging myself out of bed and back to work for the weekend . 
Friday , I'm in love . <3 
is wondering who wants to go to work for her . Anyone ? 
would like to start working toward veganism . < PROPMALE > ' n ' cheese and Frappucinos , you will be missed . 
Starting work at 12 isn't as bad as I thought . I've already eaten breakfast , cleaned my apartment , read a couple chapters of my book and gotten dressed and ready for work . Not a bad morning . 
My cat is trying to break through my patio door to get a chipmunk . 
I think I saw a dark < PROPFIRST > in the sky tonight ... 
wishes she was in < PROPMALE > right now . Only 3 months to go ! I'm so geeked out about this ... 
Having time to just lounge around and read is pretty great . <3 
I was really proud because I let myself sleep in today . Really proud until I looked at the clock and it wasn't even 8am yet . haha 
I always forget how much Prisoner of Azkaban determines what happens in the last four books . Damn you , < PROPFIRST > Pettigrew ! 
Off to bed . The AC is broken , which means I'll be nice and toasty warm tonight . =) ( no sarcasm ) 
Tread Lightly , she is near\ 
Under the snow , \ 
Speak gently , she can hear\ 
The daisies grow . 
So after closing last night , guess what I come home to ? Lego < PROPMALE > Potter Years 1-4 for PS3 on my pillow . That totally beats a mint ! <3 
I'm officially addicted to True Blood . I'm thinking that once I get caught up on seasons 1 and 2 someone's going to have to let me come over to watch the new episodes ! 
Sometimes I wonder who needs convincing , others or yourself . Ah , redundancy . 
I hate when you're getting really into a book and then you have to stop to do something else . It stops me from even picking up a book at times . I wish I had 5 uninterrupted hours a day just to read . 
You'd kill yourself for recognition , \ 
Kill yourself to never ever stop\ 
You broke another mirror , \ 
You're turning into something you are not 
Why can I never get enough radiohead ? 
\People\ 
I like days that keep me so busy I don't have time to think . There's something very rewarding about running around like crazy . 
Oooh yeah ! Super excited about a yummy vegan dinner with my < PROPFEMALE > panda Friday !!! Look out Chicago , here we come ! =) 
is finally going to see Inception tonight . Yay ! 
Is it time to go back to sleep yet ? 
I feel strangely sad today . Strangely because there's no real reason for it . 
almost wound up with a 20ft ladder as a passenger in her car today . Definitely my scariest moment since I started driving . It landed like an inch from my tires and the guy was definitely going 50mph . I thought it looked bad and hit my breaks * just in time * 
Time to get ready to close at work ! Not super exciting , but midnight showing of < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim after !! Hurray ! 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim = < PROPFEMALE>'s favorite movie of 2010 so far . But seriously ... 
Somebody didn't get the memo that it's 2010 and NOT Ok to be an idiot . 
and ... I'm almost blonde !!! It's been years ... 
This could be\ 
interesting ... Leave a one-word comment that you think best describes\ 
me using theTHIRD letter of YOUR first name . It can only be one word . \ 
Then copy and paste this post on your wall , so I can leave a word about\ 
you . 
can't wait to get her tickets tomorrow ! Hurray ! 
can't believe ... ONE WEEK until she gets to pretend she's a wizard and ride some BA rollercoasters !!! Woot ! I think I'm ready for a vacation either way . Though I'll probably still miss work , haha . 
5 days ... 
Tomorrow morning I'll be on my way to Florida ! A week long vacation is looking pretty amazing right now ! 
Dearest friends and relatives ... I may hideout in Hogwarts and survive on butterbeer and love ... so if I never come back to Chicago , consider this goodbye . =) 
Wow . A quarter of a century has passed . No quarter life crisis though , so that's nice ! =) I really think I shouldn't have to leave tomorrow though . 
I wish everytime I looked at the nighttime sky I could see this many stars ... damn you , Chicago . 
Sometimes I forget how very much I love autumn . ( The warmer , breezier days of autumn . ) 
A thousand < PROPMALE > ain't shit to walk if I'm walking to hold you 
Season 3 of True Blood ... finished . 
Also ... Happy 156th Birthday , < PROPFIRST > Wilde ! <3 \Most\ 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice - People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ? 
Who's going to see Deathly Hallows part 1 with me at midnight thurs the 18th ? < PROPMALE > works at 5am the next day and is NOT up for it ... Any takers ? 
Nothing like leaving a party just to walk back 15 minutes later ... haha . I'm going to be tired at work tomorrow . 
My phone is seriously a schizo right now and is only working when it wants to . If anyone needs to get a hold of me , you send a message on here . I should have a new phone by tomorrow . 
BROTHER\ 
WEEK . If you have a brother who has made you laugh , tortured you , \ 
stuckup for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw\ 
you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , &\ 
you can't do without , copy and paste this to your wall 
To my friends going to the premier of HP7 at Quarry 14 , are we doing IMAX or regular screen ? 
New phone will be here tomorrow ! If you haven't already given me your phone number , please do ! 
Tomorrow night cannot come fast enough . Chicago Diner with my best gal < PROPFEMALE > and a weekend full of excitement . The only hard part is deciding which delicious meal to choose . 
So much to do this month ... so let's make plans and add to the list . Any takers ? ;) 
< PROPMALE > and Jemaine on the Simpsons ?? Yes , please . =) 
kind of can't wait for Conan tomorrow . 
would really , really like to go back to < PROPMALE > . Rollercoasters and reading on the beach ? Ummm ... yes . 
Thank you Daiya Cheese for making pizza and < PROPMALE > ' n ' cheeze possible . I will love you always . <3 
I'm happy that Facebook is around to remind me that next Thursday is our anniversary because I have the memory of a goldfish . Five years have flown by ! 
So ... next week has me smiling already- < PROPMALE > Potter comes out , Dresden Dolls concert , Chicago Diner ( hopefully ) and some anniversary festivities . I'm pretty much sold on it being the best week ever . Ha . 
To any friends who shop Half Price Books , don't forget today is the 50% off coupon ! And it automatically applies to whatever the most expensive item you get is ! ( Yeah , I know , I'm lame for advertising work sales , but c'mon , 50% is pretty awesome ! ) 
I've just been informed the word \darling\ " is ancient and should no longer be used . I disagree . " 
Time to go to sleep . My ramblings are officially no longer making sense . Goodnight , darlings . ( haha ) I'm just happy to learn that \darling\ " is alive and well . " 
Dresden Dolls tonight ! Woohoo ! 
< PROPFEMALE > F*cking < PROPMALE > , you are too wonderful for words . < PROPFIRST > Viglione , you make me giggle . Best night ever . <3 Dresden Dolls <3 
< PROPMALE > Potter & The Deathly Hallows pt 1 down ! Despite the long running time , the split made the movie feel waaaay too short , I really was disappointed when it was over . Still , I CANNOT wait until pt 2 ! ( too bad I have to ) 
Spell check . Seriously underrated . 
To any ladies that didn't get a specific wall post from me , I just want to let you know that I think you're all lovely people , otherwise I wouldn't have added you as friends on here . We should all try to keep in touch more often . I know that most likely won't happen , and that's ok . But you're still lovelies . <3 ( Yes , I used lovely as a noun . Deal with it . ) 
I'm going to read and pretend to sleep now . Finally get to do my Christmas shopping this week ! ( Thank you , Half Price Books for loving your employees and treating them so extremely well . Bonus check ftw ! ) 
Maybe I am a little too nerdy . 
30 Rock has a surprising number of Conan O'Brien jokes . I am pleased with this . 
just found a really old journal and read it . Haha ... Sixteen year old < PROPFEMALE > was kind of a mess . Thank goodness that whole \growing up\ " thing happens . " 
RIP < PROPFEMALE > G . She was for sure the best cat ever , purring right until the end and holding on to me with little < PROPFEMALE > claws . My heart is seriously broken . I wish pets could outlive their families . 
I've decided planning things is not a strength of mine . 
Would you go to a wedding if you couldn't bring a guest ? Assuming you know more than a few people that will be at the wedding ... 
I can dance and win at games , like backgammon and life . 
If you own it , it's \your\ " car . \ 
I had a dream in which < PROPFEMALE > White was a vampire . Maybe I'm a little too immersed in pop culture ? Let's even go with drowning . 
I'm pretty sure my neighbors are serial killers . Or at least completely insane . ( Not < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > , ha ) 
Last night I was thinking how nothing would make me happier than more snow . I'm always happy that mother nature gets me that way . I'm moving to Cali . Who's coming with me ? 
It surprises me how many people truly care about Valentines Day . Am I without a heart ? 
Some weird , book-dwelling bug bit me today at work . Itchy ! Hazard of the job ? 
So let me get this straight ...... Kelsey Grammer can end a 15 yr marriage by phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , 53% of Americans get divorced and 30-60% cheat on their spouses . Yet , same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you find this ridiculous !!! 
Sometimes , I look outside , and I think that a lot of other people have seen this snow before . Just like I think that a lot of other people have read those books before . And listened to those songs . I wonder how they feel tonight . 
It's nice being able to go home for break . =) 
Leave it to me to forget that I have concert tickets for tonight ... Luckily it's a late show ! 
Is anyone in Chicago interested in going to Bright Eyes tonight ? We might have two tickets up for grabs ... 
I'm seriously considering giving up my cell phone when At&t finishes buying out T-mobile . It's a tough decision only because of a cell phone's value in emergencies . Other than that I don't really need to be connected to the world 24/7 . ( She says from her Facebook . ) 
What a busy day ! Everyone was selling books today . 
No matter how much you like your job , there are some days the couch is more inviting . * sigh * Off to work I go . 
Apparently < PROPFIRST > Sheen's first show ended with a ton of booing and people wanting their money back . Is anyone really surprised that this already unfunny , pathetic creature would be made even more so when you paid over a hundred dollars for his nonsense ? Here's a hint : there's no editing on stage . That is all . 
Vegan goodies today ! 
If you knew me 5-10 years ago , chances are you don't know me at all . So don't assume and we'll be just fine . :) 
The Chicago Diner is having a 28th anniversary event today with door prizes and discounts but I have jury duty until 5 . You can just call in sick to jury duty , right !? * wishful thinking *
