Let love and faithfulness never leave you ; bind them around your neck , write them on the tablet of your heart . Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man . [ Proverbs 3:3 -4 ] NIV 
When you < PROPFEMALE > the bible , satan gets a headache .. When you open it , he \ 
collapses .. When he sees you reading it he faints , and when you are about to repost this message , he will try and discourage you ... I defeated him\

This is how we know what love is : Jesus Christ laid down his life for us . And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters . 1 < PROPFIRST > 3:16 NIV 
I have to post this in parts b/c of FB's charecter limitations , but I have to share this with anyone who has ever lost a loved one :\

you were gone before we knew it , and only God knows why . 
I don't know who wrote this but I just have to share . For me , this poem is for my dad , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Mounts , my Grandmother , < PROPFEMALE > Blankenship Mounts Presley , and most recently deceased my Great-uncle Harless Mitchem and Uncle < PROPMALE > Mounts . We have experienced so much death in recent years , and I thank God for getting us through ... read on : 
Dear Mr. President , I hear u would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would u also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue rais ... ing pay ... for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if u agree !

I thank my God every time I remember you . \ 
In all my prayers for all of you , I always pray with joy\ 
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now , \ 
being confident of this , that he who began a good work in you will < PROPFEMALE > it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus . \ 
Philipians 1:3 -6 ( NIV ) 
Don't worry about anything ; instead , pray about everything . Tell God what you need , and thank him for all he has done . \ 
If you do this , you will experience God's peace , which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand . His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus . Philippians 4:6 -7 ( NLT ) 
Follow God’s example , therefore , as dearly loved children\ 
and walk in the way of love , just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God . Ephesians 5:1 -2 ( NIV ) 
\ . . . she shall bring forth a son 
From now until December 7 change your profile picture to one of a cartoon \ 
character from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . The objective of this is not to see any human face on facebook but an invasion of memories for the fight against Violence to Children remember , we were kids once too . :) 
What did God say after creating man ? \ 
\I can do so much better ! \"" 
Will you be willing to donate your status for just a few minutes to HONOR a fallen < PROPFEMALE > who's just passed away while serving our country ? Cpl . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ( USMC ) died Dec 6 while serving in Afghanistan . He leaves behind a wife and a newborn son named in his honor , who was born approx 24 hours after news of his death . Repost to honor this Hero and his family . 
I don't need an angel on top of my Christmas tree . I already have one in heaven looking down on me ...... Put this as you status if you have someone in heaven you wish you could be with this Christmas 
Greatest man in history , named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master . Had no degree , yet they called him Teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called him Healer . He had no army , yet kings feared Him . He won no military battles , yet he conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . Re-post if you believe with your heart ... < PROPFEMALE > Christmas !! 
For to us a child is born , \ 
to us a son is given , \ 
and the government will be on his shoulders . \ 
And he will be called \ 
Wonderful Counselor , Mighty God , \ 
Everlasting Father , < PROPMALE > of Peace . \ 
- < PROPMALE > 9:6 ( NIV ) 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around you & whispered come with me . With tearful eyes we watched and saw you pass away . Although we love you dearly , we could not make you stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest . God broke our hearts to prove to us he only takes the best . Put on your status if there is someone in heaven you will miss this Christmas 
An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the < PROPFEMALE > of the Lord shone around them , and they were terrified . \ 
But the angel said to them , “Do not be afraid . I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people . \ 
Today in the town of < PROPFIRST > a Savior has been born to you ; he is the Messiah , the Lord . \ 
This will be a sign to you : You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger . ” \ 
< PROPMALE > 2 : 8-12

Do I work ? Yes ! I work 24 hrs a day . Why ? Because I'm a MOMMY . I am a cook , cleaner , parent , teacher , referee , nanny , nurse , handyman , maid , security officer and a comforter . I don't get holidays , sick-pay or a day OFF . I work through the day and the night . I am on call at all hours . Now tell me my job isn't a real one ... IT'S THE BEST ONE ! Re-post if you are blessed enough to be a MOMMY 
WHAT CANCER CANNOT DO ; Cancer is so limited ..... It cannot cripple love . It cannot shatter hope . It cannot corrode faith . It cannot destroy peace . It cannot kill friendship . It cannot suppress memories . It cannot silence courage . It cannot invade the soul . It cannot steal eternal life . It cannot conquer the spirit ............... \I will never leave nor forsake you\ " . < PROPFIRST > 1:5 " 
Had a great dinner with < PROPFIRST > , Jessy and the boys ! Nothing like a little family time ! 
“Let not your heart be troubled ; you believe in God , believe also in Me . \ 
In My Father’s house are many mansions ; if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you . \ 
And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and receive you to Myself ; that where I am , there you may be also . \ 
And where I go you know , and the way you know . ”\

Watch out , Summersville- Youth on fire for Christ are coming your way ! Please pray for a safe trip today and tomorrow , that the many young people who don't know Jesus as their savior are able to find their way to Him , and those that know the love of the Father & Son have thier flame fueled this weekend . GOD IS GOOD ! 
Jesus said to him , “You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind . \ < PROPMALE > 22:37 NKJV\

BORROWED : Be very careful when you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears . The woman came from a mans rib , not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal ! Under the arm to be protected and next to the heart to be loved . Copy and paste if u agree 
Burr ... it's cold out there ! Winter is pretty and everything , but is it spring yet !? 
Trust in the LORD with all your heart , \ 
And < PROPFEMALE > not on your own understanding ; \ 
In all your ways acknowledge Him , \ 
And He shall direct your paths . \ 
Proverbs 3:5 -6 NKJV

Copy and paste this if you have a Grandma in heaven . If roses grow in Heaven , Lord , then pick a bunch for me . place them in my Grandma's arms and tell her they're from me . Tell her that I love and miss her , and when she turns to smile , place a kiss upon her cheek and hold her for awhile !!!!!!! 
For by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God , \ 
not of works , lest anyone should boast . \ 
For we are His workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them . \ 
Ephesians 2:8 -10 ( NKJV )
