Ugh- there's not much worse than trying to find a job in this economy 

Sometimes the unenvolved party is the most afflicted party when there is a problem ... 
Something is up and i can tell ... i don't like where this is headed .... 
hmm ... i want to find a nice place to practice parkour ... it looks so fun and so beastly :D 
Damnit even more things in my life to decide on ... there are so many stupid moves i can make right now .... and i know i'm going to make another mistake :/ 
My new Philosophy :\ 
If it is something you truly want then you must WORK for it . And if you work hard enough for it , It is no longer a maybe . Maybe is for those who don't try . And by trying you turn an IF it happens into WHEN it happens . For good things happen to those who apply themselves . 
If you stick with somethine , and give it your all , things will come out in the ways that you hope for . 
Hope is essentially useless if you do not make any attempt to attain what you < PROPFEMALE > . 
Happiness is like cocaine . In its purest form it gives you the best high ... but people will falsify it and take away its purity and you are left with only a portion of true happiness ... \ 
One must find a way to obtain it in its purest form to truly enjoy it . 
hahaha the after effects of donating blood are AMAZING ....
