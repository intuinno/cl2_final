Its a new year !!! Let's make it our resolution to talk to someone or acknoledge someone you might not on a day-to-day basis , believe me you might save someone =) ( and yes im aware it's a bit cliche ) 

Kinda diggin a couple guys right now ... but we'll see what happens =] gotta finish < PROPFEMALE > room today !!! 
There's craziness surrounding me , there's so much going on , it gets hard to breath . when all my faith has gone , you bring it back to me , Im not sure of my priorities , When ive lost sight of where im meant to be , like holy water washing over me , You Make It Real for me :) 
Goin to bed ! mom and jai are out with aunt heather =[ 
really tired and wondering about some things ? 
Im not sure what the plans are for the rest of the night , i want to go to the football game and < PROPFIRST > might come over . idk yet 
Had an amazing day !!! Took pics with < PROPFIRST > , and ironically ran into < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !!!! oh yeah and i met up with < PROPMALE > @ Buger < PROPMALE > for lunch =) so all in all i had an awesome day =)

I hate it when people aren't who they claim to be , but i am who i am and that's all that < PROPFEMALE > tters . Lovin < PROPFEMALE > life and everything and everyone involved ... almost everything/one anyways . lol 
Why would you keep something like that from me ??? I wouldnt have been angry , it hurts me more that you didn't tell me ... and your one of my best friends ?? 
how can someone seem so perfect .... yet seem so far away ???

READ THIS AND THEN RE-COPY IT TO YOUR OWN STATUS TO GET THE WORD OUT : If you get a notification that says a friend reported you to Facebook for being offensive or in violation of terms of service , do NOT click it . It's a virus ... post this on your own site for your friends .... 
I wonder if the whole world is bipolar .... one minute its all fun and games and the next we take part in a depressing secluded attitude so to speak ... idk ... myabe ill understand someday

I think East Peoria has gotten way outta control .

Whenever your down , ill stick around and tell you of someone who will and is always there for you .... He is all-knowing and all-loving =) 
Things may not go accordingly but put it in Gods hands and he wil handle it according to his will ... ask and you shall receive .

I need some inspiration !!!! lol 
No more wasting my life !! Isn't it nice to know , That the media will sway our votes , Cause seriously we've got to see That they choose what we know Our morals get thrown For the next big thing we've got to see What is it for , do we want more ? And on and on it goes till all of us are sucked in , So shut it off and see we're missing out on living 
Had a ton of fun last night at Rock Church !!! Surrounded by great people and a great Savior !! Thank You to everyone who came out last night when the could have been somewhere else but they chose to be with their brothers and sisters in christ =) What a beautiful sight 
No more wasting my life on this worlds addictions !! Isn't it nice to know , That the media will sway our votes , Cause seriously we've got to see That they choose what we know Our morals get thrown For the next big thing we've got to see What is it for , do we want more ? And on and on it goes till all of us are sucked in , So shut it off and see we're missing out on living

Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes , I had a good day , I appreciate all my friends , family and most of all the almighty =) We are blessed everyday and i just happen to be very blessed and all i can do is give thanks ! 
Im surrounded by amazing people !!! I am truly blessed , tonight was truly refreshing and eye-opening ! I love my friends and family ! If all of us wouldn't pass judgement and just care for each other or do something for someone and expect nothing in return , the world would be a better place . I LOVE < PROPFEMALE > BOYS AND THEY KNOW IT !!! 
I am weak but not broken and it's through the blood of Jesus Christ that I am able to persevere ! 
My Journey begins ..... Im driving to Tennessee .... by myself as some of you know . be prayin for me , love you all !!! Talk to ya soon !

Im asking God what he wants , which way to go , who he wants me to be . Im giving up my ideals and putting it in his hands , Your will is my command Lord 
She was a blond hair blue eyed girl , she never conformed to this world , but was she really heard ... what was her impact ? 
She was a blond hair blue eyed girl , she tried not to conform to this world and loved the Lord , but who knew her , what did she make of herself .... was anyone proud to know her or be friends with her . What was her impact in this life , in this world ? 
I'm thirsty , God , I'm thirstyFrom drinking what destroys meI'm pouring poison in my cup I'm hungry , God , I'm hungryConsuming what controls meSomehow it never fills me up We all want to find something to pass the timeBut that could never be enough Everybody says we're all so differentBut everybody knows we're all the sameWe're all trying to find a pill to numb the painSomething's got to change 
There's something in you eyes , is everything alright , you look up to the sky , you long for something more ... I think I understand 
There's something in your eyes , is everything alright ?, you look up to the sky , you long for something more .... I think I understand .... You're simply hurting inside .... 
Replace the fear of the unknown with curiosity and faith !! 
“Praying for those in need of prayer , although we go through trials we must still be aware of others , 1 simple thing could literally save someones life ... so take the time to say hello to someone or simply smile , you are doin great things in so many ways by serving others ! ” 
Day 2 of Finals tomorrow =/ bleh ! cannot wait for things to fall into place 
What if I'm overtaken , What if I never make it ?, What if no one's there ?, Will you hear my prayer ? When you take that first step into the unknown , you know that He won't let you go . So what are you waiting for ? What do you have to lose ? your insecurities they try to hold to you but you know you're made for more , so don't be afraid to move , your faith is all it takes and you can walk on the water too ! 
Lord < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change , the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference . 
How many tears must I cry before I learn to say good-bye , I make the same mistakes all the time ... What if Im overtaken ? What if I never make it ? What if no one's there ? Will you hear my prayer ? 
If the source of my ambition is the treasure I obtain , If I measure my successes on a scale of earthly gain , If the focus of my vision is the status I attain , My accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain . I'm laying down my arms and running helplessly to Yours . I surrender all my human soul desires . If sacrafice requires that all my kingdoms fall , I surrender all 
How many times must I cry before I learn to say good-bye ? I make the same mistakes all the time . I don't wanna cry anymore , i wanna be pushin to an open door . I see the clouds roll in , I hear the thunder crash , I see the lightning strike and I feel the rain on my tear stained face , I shoulda seen it coming , Im sorry you're hurting and Im sorry I wasn't as strong as you thought I was . 
One tear in the driving rain , One voice in a sea of pain , Could the maker of the stars hear the sound of my breakin ' heart ? One light , that's all I am , right now I can barely stand , If You're everything You say You are , won't You come close and hold my heart ? So many questions without answers , Your promises remain , I can't sleep but I'll take my chances to hear You call my name .... 
What do u do when u feel like everyone you thought you could turn to or people who are your \friends\ " don't really seem to care ? When they call our name we come running but if the roles were switched would they do the same for you ? " 
Questions , problems , answers ... I've got none . 
Im desperate for every word You say , to know You more than I could ever imagine . Im over this ! Im tired of my old ways , Im chasin after You , Lord , reveal yourself to me ! 
In ur ocean I'm ankle deep\ 
\ 
I feel the waves crashing on my feet\ 
It's like I know where I need 2 be , but\ 
I can't figure out\ 
Just how much air I'll need 2 breathe\ 
When ur wave crashes over me\ 
There's only 1 way to figure out ... \ 
In a day dream , I couldn't live like this\ 
I wouldn't stop till I found somethin beautiful\ 
When I wake up , knowing all I have \ 
is still not what I need ... All I need is You ! 
It's ur life do whatcha gpnna do , the world is watchin u . Everyday the choices u make say what u r and who ur heart beats for , It’s an open door , It’s ur life ! Are u who u always said u would be ? with a sinking feeling in ur chest , always waiting for someone else to fix u . Tell me when did u forget to live the way that u believe ? This is ur opportunity to let ur life be 1 that lights the way for all to see ! 
The creator of all the Earth , He never grows weak or weary , No 1 can measure the depths of His understanding , He gives power 2 the weak , n strength 2 the powerless , Even youth will become weak n tired , n young men will fall in exhaustion , But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength , They will run n not grow weary , They will walk n not faint 
Why is that you can do things for people and give them things and they just leave it carelessly behind as they move on to a so called new life ? You can go for long periods of time and not truly know who a person is , It's time to move on and make a new ! 
Sometimes in order hear Him , you have to pull yourself away from the chaos of life and actually have a intimate conversation with Him ... never underestimate the power of prayer :) 
K im finally goin to bed ... hopefully tomorrow will be a brighter day ! http://chatter.com/a/9rvca?ref=nf 
I need the courage to < PROPFEMALE > on , cuz I cant see whats ahead . There are places Ive wished I could be , battles Ive wanted to win , dreams that have slipped through my hands , I may never be back again\ 
But .... Im still a dreamer , a believer , I lost my faith in so many things but I still believe in You cuz You can make anything new =) 
There are battles Ive wanted to win , dreams that have slipped through my hands but Im ... http://chatter.com/a/9ztdj?ref=nf

Choices are made .... Mistakes are made .... they're both the same in the way that there are consequences , whether they be good or bad ... remember not all consequences are bad . Either way they both shape you into the person you were meant to be :)

are made .... Mistakes are made .... they're both the same in the way\ 
that there are consequences , whether they be good or bad ... remember\ 
not all consequences are bad . Either way they both shape you into the\ 
person you were meant to be :) 
Be aware of the things you do , the things you say and how you treat people .... people are watching .... God is watching :) 
It goes by .... It catches up with you .... It changes people .... and it need not be wasted .... what could they be talking about ? 
If we are the body ... Why aren't His arms reaching ? Why aren't His hands healing ? Why aren't His words teaching ? And if we are the body , Why aren't His feet going ? Why is His love not showing them there is a way ?.... Jesus is the way ! We need to be reminded of that every so often I think .. 
We are in desperation , we need reach this generation , WE ARE SPEAKING LOUDER THAN BEFORE ! 
When I had no choice he gave me a voice , \ 
now I'm singing , Yes I'm singing and it wasn't long before you gave me a song\ 
worth singing , yeah I'm singing .... \ 
Hold on child , hold on , the good < PROPMALE > is near ... 
Seems to me the line is dead when I call , no one there , I need to know ! My mind's playin games again , You're right where You have always been . I want to be in the place that I once knew , as a little child , fall into the bed of faith prepared for me , constantly the eyes of God watched over me ! Tell me I'm a fool , tell me that You love me for the fool I am , comfort me like only You can !

Mom's in the ER , we don't know what's going on yet but we'll keep you updated . Keep her in your prayers , thanks ! 
Dear God , so many unanswered question , time and time again we silently cry inside , we can't even fathom the reasons why . Heart's on fire for all the wrong reasons , one day we might be able to stand and say this is the day ! 
The task ahead of you is never greater than the power within you with < PROPMALE > ! 
Had tons of fun at momma < PROPFEMALE>'s home !!! Met alot of amazing people , hope to see you guys next year , if not sooner !!!! Hope you guys are being good !! Love you all !!! 
Today is my 2nd day at work with Panera 4-9 =) 
Don’t know how it is You looked at me n ' saw the person that I could be , Awakening my heart , Breaking through the dark , there’s a joy inside I can’t contain But even perfect days can end in rain and though it’s pouring down I see You through the clouds shining on my face ; like sunlight burning at midnight , making my life something so beautiful , beautiful ; Mercy reaching to save me all that I need You are so beautiful 
Got up early to get < PROPFIRST > ready for school and take him to the bus , Im surprisingly awake and ready to do something .... but what ? 
Sorry for bein an emotional wreck and for being a little over- analytical , I know it's not your fault , Im sorry =) Hopefully you won't hold this against me .... haha 
Been\ 
there , done that , messed around , Im havin fun don't let me down , Ill never\ 
let you sweep me off my feet !!! I won't let you turn around and tell me\ 
now , Im much to proud , all you do is fill me up with doubt ! This time , \ 
baby , Ill be bulletproof !! 
Conviction comes late at night ... the phone rings and Im by your side ... you may be hurting , I come to rescue but who will rescue me . Tell me whatcha wanna hear , tell me that the time is near , that you'll find me ... tell me when the pain is gone , tell when you'll right the wrong , I know you're here ! 
I tell myself that you're no good for me , I wish you well but < PROPFEMALE > never leaves , I could fight this to the end ... but maybe I don't wanna win ..... 
Tell me when the pain is gone ... Tell me when you right the wrong .... are You there ?, Do you even care ? Time wasted , emotion wasted , energy wasted ..... for what ? 
Here comes the night pulling puppet strings on my heart again , shows me all of this time I've been blind to this waking life . Now I ... see it everywhere . Cause I'm not lost , just looking for the < PROPMALE > , and I'm takin it , one day at a time and I'm gettin by . By the way .... \ 
You're still on my mind ... 
This whole reutine is getting old , so am i , and so are you .... don't cry to me no more ! You like the way that people stare at you now ... you look so fake , just thought you should , you'll be replaced by something typical ! you think you can do whatever it is you please , not before you wind up on your knees .... don't cry to me anymore !!! 
It\ 
takes me falling to the ground to admit to fully needing You , then when\ 
I'm breathing my last breath \Come and save me ! \ " I will cry to You ! \ 
Just got home from work , Im kinda super tired ! Im supposed to help < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Oquenda paint her room tomorrow =) 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Oquenda and I painted her room last night and now her brother < PROPMALE > is on the piano and Im on here . lol ! Plans with Dereka and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Oquenda again tonight ! 
Everybody says we're all so different , yet everybody knows we're all the same , we're all tryna finda pill to numb the pain .... somethings gotta change ! When everything we say n take just leads to war n hate , we only pass the blame sedate the pain n move along But somethin feels so wrong , so deep inside , so hard to hide ..... so desperatly we try n try ... we're not okay , we're not alright we NEED to pray for help !!! <3 
Tired .... ready to just veg .... bed here I come !!! 
The things we see around us are only temporary , we try & try to achieve the impossible because at a young age we are told to be successful . You see something they failed to mention is that what we strive for is only temporary . The world tells us that the thing people say & do is okay , when inside we know it is wrong . God has paved this road & has shown us the way but we constantly stray despite the obvious warnings ! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Oquenda is at my house for the evening and tomorrow =) 
Got real burnt today @ Splashdown , watched Kayden and < PROPMALE > out with shel =) I know why you set the trap ... I know why you dress in black .... Flies in your web , for you that means success .... right ? 
This childish love burning to be released . Insecurities , lies had taken hold of me & calloused my heart . This is my final goodbye to halfhearted dances , my final goodbye to love that's whispered in fear , my final goodbye to all your expectations ; join me in this farewell lullaby !

Quote of the day : It is easier to become outraged by injustice half a world away than by oppression and discrimination half a block away from home .

It has been a long weekend and now it's time for a little sleep . School tomorrow , first day of homecoming week !!! lol 
Take my hand , I give it to You . Now You own me all I am , You said You would never leave me . I believe You , I believe . I can feel you all around me , thickening the air I'm breathing , holding on to what I'm feeling , savoring this heart that's healed ! 
Thoughts of you and how you've changed me , fill my mind ! Without You where would I be ? So even though I've tried to express my thanks , it never comes out how I hoped . I want to say so much more , so with these simple words I'll try ; I love You ! My heart is Yours , only Yours ! I long to give You all of me ... My everything ! 
Had a pretty good day , School & Work ! I would just like to say that without music I would probably go clinically insane .... some people run , some people scream , so people paint .... me , I sing ... sing at the top of my lungs ! or I just listen to good songs with powerful messages . 
Goodmorning !!! Today will be filled with accomplishments , at least that's my goal ... haha ! Notice I didn't say plan , plans just never work out anymore . 
Going to Wal-Mart & Petsmart to get Rascal a new collar ! yay !!!

Babysitting < PROPFIRST > , I worked from 8- 3:30 , church tomorrow 9am & 11am . Soooooo tired ... 
Like an apple on a tree hiding out behind the leaves , I was difficult to reach but you picked me ! Like a shell upon a beach , just another pretty piece , I was difficult to see but you picked me ... Thank You < PROPMALE > ! 
Little girls don't know how to be sweet girls mamma didn't teach her , little boys don't know how to treat little girls daddy didn't show him ! Love , Save the Empty ! 
Why , why are You still here with me ? Didn't You see what I've done ? In my shame I want to run and hide myself but it's here I see the truth , I don't deserve You ! But I need You to love me , and I won't keep my heart from You this time and I'll stop this pretending , that I can somehow deserve what I already have ... I need You to love me !!!

Why ? Why are You still here with me ? Didn't You see what I've done ? In my shame I want to run & hide myself , but it's here I see the truth , I don't deserve You ! But I need You to love me and I , I won't keep my heart from You this time . I'll stop this pretending that I can , somehow deserve what I already have .... 
Singing at church and then I have to run to my choir concert at the school ! doin dishes and then Ill be on my way ! 
I was thinking .... what if tomorrow was my last day on this earth ? Who would say that they loved me or that I touched their lives in some way ? Sometimes we get so caught up in what needs to be done we don't stop to think about our effect on other people . Stop & take a moment to consider the people in your life ... Have you taken the time to actually stop & listen ? 
Why do we let society dictate our lives when we dictate society by the way we live our lives ? -Caeleigh Elizabeth\

Wonderful is what I percieved this life would be pain and problem free ! But over time I found reality and through it all I see , you're the only one who gets me ! I may be misunderstood but I wouldn't ever fake it , you're the only one who understands my pain ! Doesn't matter what they do what they think what they say at the of the day Im okay anyway !
