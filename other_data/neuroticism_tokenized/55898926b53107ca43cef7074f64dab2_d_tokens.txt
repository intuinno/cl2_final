Hmmm , I need a personal asst ... my life is a mess ! 
I wonder how many races in the country would be in play if the DCCC and the DSCC put even a minor amount of money behind every seat . I can say being in a untargeted race in Texas ... with 100k we would be in the lead . But they flush millions down the drain on one race here or there that we could give up and win 5 races in other places

It's really great to know that we can go in the reddest of red districts in the US and force people to play defense . If only the DCCC would figure out the fact that we can play in all of the seats with an investment ... 
I have to say ... god bless the pipefitters ... 
Do not forget the smallest gestures shape people's day ! :-) Take the time to make someone smile ! 
Sigh ... all these Halloween pics make me sad . Yes Election staff do not get Halloween ... Damn you Nov 2nd !

To all my fellow political staffers out there ... keep up the fight no matter what side you are fighting for . We are the heart and soul of campaigns and keep yourself as healthy as you can . P.S. Don't steal yard signs ! 
Omg gotv polling sign posting done ... 17 hours folks 17 hours
