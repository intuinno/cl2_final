I ran into Mr. < PROPFIRST > Ruff ( XD ) at Sabino Canyon today ! It was < PROPFEMALE > funny . I wish I had hugged him . Mr. Ruff was my favorite teacher at Marana . Sorry Mr. Maes , but you come in a close second . I also sliced my foot open at the creek up there . Whoops ! XD 
Playing the amazing video game Heavy Rain for the PS3 . It is absolutly amazing and worth any amount of money . Sadly I totally fucked up on the game . I made it to the end with all 4 of my characters alive & mostly ok and practically got all of them killed cause I messed up on one little thing . Now I have to play again to try and get a better ending . XD 
\Blasters are for people too dumb to talk their way out of trouble ( unless you happen to be an assassin wielding a blaster . In that case 
PLEASE READ FULL POST PEOPLE !!!!! Just went and saw the Karate Kid . TOTALLY AMAZING !!!!! For those of you who are sore because you loved the original please withold judgement . I LOVED the original Karate Kid , its one of my favorite movies but this new one is absolutly amazing . It lives up to the name . 
PLEASE READ 1ST POST !!! The fighting is more like Mixed Martial Arts than just Karate or Kung Fu . The fight scenes are epic and the story is cute . It follows the same basic premise as the original with a few changes . All in all . An awesome movie that I think even diehard fans of the original will love ! Go see it if you can !!!!!!

ITS MOVING DAY !!! Ok I admit it , I didn't sleep at all last night and I only got 5 hours the night before . I was trying to watch the whole second season of < PROPFEMALE > in a day and a half . I have 2 return it to my friend . Now I'm exhausted and I have to do lots of heavy lifting . scratch that , I'm not tired just odd feeling ... and very hungry . 
Ok I'm in a lot of pain . Just finished loading the moving truck . I cut the side of my hand pretty bad , got some nice bruises . Needless to say I'm looking forward to 5 uneventful days in a car . Then the unloading . 
Ok we made it 2 florida unharmed & with all of our stuff in 1 piece . My rooms unpacked & I really like it here . Trip was uneventful , nothing much to say but we have bigger issues here ! The Last Airbender just came out in theatres & Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 8% . I'm on the fence . I hate that they made a live action movie out of my favorite tv show but as a fan I still want 2 see it . Anyone seen it yet ? I want 2 know !

I understand that Scissors can beat Paper , and I get how Rock can beat Scissors , but there's no fucking way Paper can beat Rock . Paper is supposed to magically wrap around Rock leaving it immobile ? Why the hell can't paper do this to scissors ? Screw scissors , why can't paper do this to people ? Why aren't sheets of college ruled notebook paper constantly suffocating student as they attempt to take notes in class ?

Castiel : Nooo ! Yes . \ 
Sam : What the hell happened to you ? \ 
Castiel : I found a liquor store . \ 
Sam : And ? \ 
Castiel : I drank it . 
Sam : < PROPFIRST > , there's ten times as much < PROPFEMALE > about angels as there is about anything else we've ever hunted . \ 
< PROPFIRST > : You know what , there's a ton of < PROPFEMALE > on unicorns too . In fact , I hear that they ride on silver moonbeams , and that they shoot rainbows out of their ass ! \ 
Sam : ( looking heartbroken ) Wait , there's no such thing as unicorns ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : ( looks concerned for a moment , then catches on ) Cute . 
Dean : ( On Castiel trying to find God ) Try New Mexico , I hear he's on a tortilla . \ 
Castiel : No , he's not on any flatbread . 
* Castiel walks through the door as < PROPFIRST > is being glomped by a big naked guy*\

just survived an awful night . I hate migranes with a passion . Anyone who says migranes aren't that awful has never experienced one . It is 100x worse than any headache . It was like an accelerated form of the flu but with the added feeling of a screwdriver being shoved in my eyes . Ugh , I need to go back to sleep .

WOOT ! Thanks to everyone who wished me luck ! I now have a job at Dunkin Donuts . I start training in a week or so & the store opens at the end of the month ! XD 
What happens when you pair a bloodthirsty war grok with an elite hydra tank ? Either the deadliest tag team in the known universe , or the most awkward blind date on record . Or both . We're betting both . 
I now have a car . Its a white 1995 Toyota Camry < PROPFEMALE > . It has a tail , and only 105,000 < PROPMALE > . I'm so excited ! Now I have a job and a car . I feel like such a grownup . XD

Hiccup : This is Berk . It's twelve days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death . It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery . My village . In a word ? Sturdy , and it's been here for seven generations , but every single building is new . We have fishing , hunting , and a charming view of the sunset . The only problems are the pests . You see , most places have mice or mosquitoes . We have ... Dragons ! 
Hiccup : My name's Hiccup . Great name , I know . But it's not the worst . Parents believe that a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls . Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that . \ 
Viking : [ screams in Hiccup's face ] RAAAAHHHR ! \ 
[ then , casually ] \ 
Viking : Morning !

Ruffnut : [ sniffing ] Ugh ! Do you ever bathe ? \ 
Tuffnut : You don't like it , then just get your own blind spot ! \ 
Ruffnut : How about I give you one ...! \ 
[ the dragon notices them . They scream and run for cover ] \ 
Gobber : Blind spot , yes . Deaf spot ? Not so much . 
Dean : Well , I learned a valuable lesson . Always take down your Christmas decorations before New Years , or you might get filleted by hooker from God . HA ! 
Stoick : [ about Hiccup ] You know what he's like . From the time he could crawl , he's been ... different . He doesn't listen , he has the attention span of a sparrow ! I take him fishing , and he goes hunting for ... for trolls ! \

Me : I don't know . That could be a great distraction . \ 
Alistair : Me shimmying down the darkspawn line ? Sure , we could kill them while they roll around laughing . \ 
Duncan : ( sigh ) 
I'm holding Alistair responsible for my unrealistic expectations of men , and for fucking up ? all ? my future relationships . Damn you , you adorable dork ! God , I want to hug him . XD

Who knew people could be such douchebags . If we close in 15 minutes you cannot dine in . It's common sense that you will not have enough time to have a server take ur order , make the food , and eat before we close . So why bother asking ?!?! 
Everyone knows the old saying ' the world doesn't revolve around you . ' so is it paranoia , worry , or arrogance that makes me feel like everyone is talking about me behind my back . ( and it's never good things I imagine them saying )
