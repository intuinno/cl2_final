... so instead of House of Hair ... they're broadcasting a FOOTBALL GAME .... on my radio station . FOOT FRIKKIN BALL , which I thought I hated before , but suddenly hate a whole hell of a lot more . All I can say is that the stupid game better end soon and be followed by hair metal , or else .

When you have insomnia , you're never really asleep . And you're never really awake . 
Good morning 
Re-reading the first chapter of < PROPMALE > , it reoccurs to me how much like a kindergarten class we are , and poor Garizole is the exasperated but patient teacher . It's frikkin HILARIOUS , but I feel kind of bad for him that he has to deal with us , of aaaall the people who could've wandered into the < PROPMALE > . 
wishes that her keyboard was with her at school , and that it didn't actually beloing to her mother that never uses it ...

WIIIIIINDY !!!! :D :D and lots of kangaroos 
Stats for the Quotes site : been visited 271 times since it's creation in August , by 52 unique users . Seeing as there are 29 people who have Quotes sections , and some of these people have never been to the site , that's a good amount of people reading random hilarious stuff that they may or may not understand ! Good work ! 
4-3 win ! could've done with less penalties , but good game regardless . Nice 5 hole by Callahan , and 2 great goals by Gaborik . We are certainly shaping up :D 
i probably have like 10 homework assignments or something . I should probably check on that . hooot pockeeets ! 
Can you say , shut out ? 3-0 versus Anaheim ! Valiquette did pretty well , and that last empty netter was just too much ... well no it wasn't ... it was AWESOME 
I guess I have a thing for 7 hour long phone conversations 
4-2 victory ! so that's 6 wins in a row ... Damn . I'm just happy to see , for ONCE in the history of me being a rangers fan , that we have a power play that doesn't make me want to commit suicide ! 
Good morning . .... and no , I am not kidding . 
working on Haloween costume XD 
Today = Halloween costume , < PROPFIRST > + < PROPFIRST > visit ( therefore rockband most likely ) , possibly Dr. Who , dinner with Brenden , Hockey game , Halloween costume again , possibly Pokemon Blue , maybe homework , and then SLEEP ! This has the workings of a great day ! 
... just did WORK ? whAT ? and now will work on costume . hi 
wow that game SUCKED ... a really BAD end to our win streak , which wouldn't have been so bad if Tortorella hadn't put Valiquette in goal but ... what can ya do . Still doing well overall ... 
Why drink the water from my hand ? Contagious as you think I am . Just tilt my sun towards your domain . Your cup runneth over again ... 
Wow . Figuring out a schedule should NOT be this impossible . The New Media department has the absolute STUPIDEST system for when classes are available -- and the fact that what's actually available when on SIS is different on BOTH the planning sheet AND the CIAS website ?? Just great . Speaking of which , the CIAS website is freakin annoying . 
.... WTF HALLOWEEN IS IN 10 DAYS . ...... * FREAKS OUT * 
who doesn't need a little < PROPFIRST > Halen in their life ? D.O.A ! 
Coloring her netry for the deviantart Halloween contest :D despite that I have tons of homework and a Halloween costume to be making -_-;

Really wants RIT to have a Quidditch team ...

Classes are done for the week . Now ... pre-Halloween agenda : Finish costume , finish Deviantart entry , figure out what we're doing for Halloween ... 
Halloween Weather Forecast : two websites say there will be AM showers ; one says rain all day . the last time it rained on Halloween for me , I was in 6th grade >.< Please please please please pleeeaaase don't rain all day .... this is going to totally blow ... 
Really wishes she wasn't still awake working on her costume ... i want sleep 
HAPPY HALLOWEEN EVERYONE !!! Hoping for some good weather and fun today ... gunna be weird though , my first Halloween since around 8th grade where haven't been with < PROPFEMALE > .... 
Well hmm ... what do you do when no stores have pumpkins , and you've made plans to carve pumpkins ? Obviously you decide to carve apples . OBVIOUSLY . 
A decent Halloween , a bit disappointed . Experienced some awesome costumes & some cool people in the tunnels/sidewalks from Perkins to the Dorms . And a REALLY weird pair of people in green bodysuits with green material over their faces following me around through the tunnels and communicating with me through crude sign language , and dancing . Interesting to say the least . Really wished we had taken a walk though .... 
just tried to satisfy my Halloween disappointment by carving a face into one of those pumpkin-shaped pieces of < PROPFEMALE > corn ... sadly , it worked for a few minutes . lmfhao ! 
is now awake , and now going to work on a shit ton of shit for class tomorrow 
huh ! Just found out that < PROPMALE > Peart plays drums on three of the songs on Vertical Horizon's latest album . And also , he wrote the lyrics to \Even Now\ " . Rush working with Vertical Horizon .... interesting to say the least " 
Needs to find a job . Immediately . 
awaiting a text/call from < PROPFIRST > or < PROPFIRST > , and then onward to the pizza party !!! hellz yeah free food ! 
so i know what I should NOT be doing ! trying to make a role playing game based on my book . ... but I totally should be . But no , I shouldn't be . Is this due to DnD withdrawal ? AND lack-of-working-on-my-book-series withdrawal ? Probably . 
so RED is a really good band to listen to while editing a battle scene :D ( battle with Senarrl , for the curious [ and for those who actually understand that ]) 
< PROPFIRST > Party 2 with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > XD ... wheeeen they actually get here , that is !! ( Sorry < PROPFIRST > . You've been temporarily replaced . < PROPFIRST>'s fault . ) 
just got in from 2D final crit . Went okay . Now working on self-portrait for Drawing crit tomorrow , and studying the shit out of Japanese for the final tomorrow . No real time to do anything else . shit . 
why are the openers to Inuyasha so ... nooot as good as all the ending themes ? ( on episode 58 right now ) 
so Rock N Roll Train just came on Pandora ... and instantaneously , the whole AC/DC concert just flooded back to me , and I'm totally pumped . Like ... I can SEE the concert when I close my eyes , I can see them on the stage . DAMN do I ever want to be back there ... 
is home at craptastic Cohoes . IN OTHER AMAZING NEWS , IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CAN PLAY LOTS OF NEOPETS GAMES NOW 10 TIMES FOR MONEY INSTEAD OF JUST 3 - 5 . i'm not sure yet if this compensates for the fact that I'm home ... 
just got back from the 101 Dalmatians play that the middle and elementary schools put on at the high school ! WoOt ! Great job , < PROPFEMALE > , or should I say Cruella , you were awesome ! And < PROPFEMALE > , you made an awesome chihuahua ! hahaha 
CONCERT .... WAS .... SICK .... got to meet RED by total < PROPMALE > , was pleasantly surprised by Taddy < PROPMALE>'s performance which rocked pretty hard , got a guitar pick from the guitarist of Pop Evil ( they rocked even HARDER !!! ) , then got EFFIN ROCKED TO DEATH BY RED , drank from lead singer of REDs water bottle , and then saving < PROPMALE > was pretty okay 
* suspiscously * thaaat's about a horse-sized shed , ISN'T it ? 
Just got in a from a ridiculous night with my cousins , and heading back to RIT tomorrow . I'm kind of disappointed that I literally got no time to relax this entire vacation , so after more cleaning and studying when I get back to school , that is what i plan on doing . 
is finally going to update the quotes site at some point tonight . also will do a bit of cleaning tonight . also , will goof off tonight . i think i'm gunna like tonight . 
tentative schedule : cleaning for a long time , studying japanese , playing Monster Rancher , hanging out with people 
Happy birthday to who was , literally , voted Most Villainous Villain in the < PROPMALE > story 
updated some stuff on the quotes site . < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > , you've got new quotes . More to be added to the randoms ( and to other people's sections ) later ! it's late ... 
We sailed on together , We drifted apart 
I was just guessin ' , At < PROPFIRST > and figures ... Pulling the puzzles apart . Questions of science , Science and progress , Do not speak as loud as my heart . Tell me you love me , Come back and haunt me , Oh and I rush to the start . Runnin ' in circles , chasin ' tails , Comin ' back as we are ... 
I am not ready to go back to class at all , whatsoever , even vaguely ; I am , however , ready to get back to my apartment and roommates . 
ow . my everything . .... today sucks . 
fiiiiinally listening to the Dokken greatist hits CD I got a few days back . Why did it take this long ?! 
well , i should be going to bed . there's one key word in that sentence . and now ignoring everything i've just said here , I am going to work on my poster and listen to awesome music . for those of you who sleep , goodnight ! 
You can’t pick up not a single sound , You feel you’re winning , that’s what it’s all about , Knowing you are winning , oooh , And it could be the very last time , I could be in a rock ‘n’ roll dream . 
since the AC/DC concert , I have had 3 dreams tht I've been ABOUT to see them again . The dreams always end either before they get on stage or right when they're about to . So i wake up in the midst of one today and tell myself it's gunna finish when I go back to sleep . And it did ! They played Whole Lotta < PROPFEMALE > , & THEN it ended in a nightmare ! But then < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > sat next to me & I got to talk to him so it's okay . 
so remember that time when < PROPFIRST > was supposed to leave ? like 4 hours ago ? well he finally left ! :D i black-holed him on accident >.< 
Lost out at sea on a wave , Somebody's gotta save , Gotta save me . I'm someone that I've never seen , Somewhere I'd thought I never , Never would be . 
What if I got it wrong ? And no poem or song , Could put right what I got wrong . And make you feel I belong . 
We're the middle children of history . No purpose or place . We have no Great War . No Great Depression . Our Great War's a spiritual war ... our Great Depression is our lives . We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires , and movie gods , and rock stars . But we won't . And we're slowly learning that fact . And we're very , very pissed off . 
Feel loved , feel loved . But we don't , and we won't , until we figure out ... Could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign ? So close to giving up , cause faith is so hard to find . But you don't and you won't , until we figure out ... 
Holy crap on a rack . Just had a lovely breakfast with Rohit Crasta and now is chillin on campus . Meeting quidditch people at 12:30 to talk about ... quidditch ... and then will hopefully have lunch with Rohit again , and then is going to CLASS ! * gasp ! * today's weird . 
is pumped . somehow . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr. ' s birthday today . He was a real leader of men and an inspiration . Let us all let today inspire us to work towards peace , even in small ways , amongst our family and friends for example . Be kind to someone today . Let's do it up . 
I wanted to feel you , I tried to belong here , With all of the ghosts and faded headlines . But I couldn't read you ; No , you wouldn't let me . You always pull away from the ones you can't define . Are you tired of holding up the sky ? And teaching birds to fly ? You've done it all your life ... 
Omg ... I just had ANOTHER dream about AC/DC . Except this one was longer and even more detailed and more ridiculous than ever . I just wish that I could have a dream about seeing them in concert without something TERRIBLE happening -_- 
has fixed her computer so that when she changes the volume , it no longer goes , \BLOOP ! \"" 
watching Men in Tights at almost 4 am with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Pietr . What else could you want for a saturday night/near morning thing ? 
who remembers when the moose was on the loose in Cohoes ? And they < PROPMALE > up those stupid signs around the city with the picture of the moose head that said , \MOOSE ON THE LOOSE IN COHOES \"?" 
WTH ! I put on pandora internet radio while looking up < PROPFIRST > Halen on wikipedia . < PROPFIRST > HALEN comes on ! Then look up AC/DC merchandise online and just click a site , AC/DC COMES ON ! ..... AAAAHHH ! 
has come to a couple big decisions . I feel like this is the first time I've decided anything in about a year . But I'm still far from a personal victory . About as far as you can get . 
\How do I get through to you that wishes just come true in dreams ? In my dreams . \ " ~ Dio " 
a green guitar is probably the best thing ever ... 
okay ... writing a semi-creepy story that takes place during a thunderstorm while I'm sitting in the dark apartment with the creaking floor/walls and clicking radiator and other weird sounds while listening to classical music ... yeah . Great combination . * hurries up and turns lights on * 
This is what you get . This is what you get . This is what you get when you mess with us ... For a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself . Yeah for a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself . 
is in a HUGE < PROPMALE > Watanabe mood so is going to watch Memoirs of a Geisha . If I'm up for it after I might watch Letters from Iwo Jima >.< and is eating cuz i'm starving 
SUGGESTIONS ? I'm modeling for < PROPFEMALE>'s photoshoot tomorrow and am trying to figure out a famous person who has passed away that I can be for this shoot . Her original idea was < PROPFEMALE > Carpenter , but I'm trying to think if there's someone else I look more like , or could pull off better . Has to be someone who is NOT ALIVE ! 
okay . guess it's decided . I'm going to be < PROPFEMALE > Gardner for the photo thing . Thanks for your suggestions for those who actually gave real ones ! Thanks for everyone else for the joke ones that made me laugh ! ( still woulda liked to have been < PROPFEMALE > Joplin but it's all good ! ) 
I've been lookin back on my life & all the things I've done to me . I'm still lookin for the answers , I'm still searchin for the key . The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me , it just wont leave me alone . I still find it all a mystery Could it be a dream ? The road to nowhere leads to me . Through all the happiness & sorrow I guess I'd do it all again . Live for today & not tomorrow . It's still the road that never ends . 
Echoes and silence , < PROPFEMALE > and grace . All of these moments I'll never replace . No fear of my heart , absence of faith . And all I want ... is to be home . 
So the last thing I expected/planned today was to wake up run out the door to catch lunch with Rohit and < PROPFIRST > ... and then get invited to go to their classes with them . Yet here I am in their Web Design class . go figure . 
is glad she got to see Rohit and < PROPFIRST > today and also glad she she only went to one out of two of their classes ( YES , i said THEIR classes ) . But now feels kind of blah . Figuring out what I feel like doing . meh . 
Well uh uh baby I ain't got no plan , We'll float on maybe , would you understand ? ... I like songs about drifters , books about the same , They both seem to make me feel a little less insane . 
Well it woulda been , coulda been , Worse than you would ever know .... Oh the dashboard melted but we still have the radio 
was sick all last night and got no sleep til 7:30 am ... however , I had a dream about AC/DC AGAIN and this time nothing bad happened in it . It was a good concert . and also , < PROPMALE > is amazing . 
feeling waaaaaay better now , and we won the game tonight 3-2 in overtime . Now ... to find something to do until I'm ACTUALLY tired . 
Well thanks for the time I needed to think a spell , I had to think a while . I had to think a while . The ocean breathes salty , won't you < PROPFEMALE > it in ? In your head , in your mouth , in your soul . And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old . Well I don't know , I don't know , I don't know . I hope so . 
wow . just woke up . hahaha 
Cuz yesterday's got nothing for me , oh , Pictures that I'll always see . Time just fades the pages in my book of memories . I'll just keep movin ' along , No time to plant my feet . 
is rewatching the clips recorded thus far from the movie that < PROPFEMALE > and I are making ( with the help of < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > ) . Dear god this is the crappiest , but absolutely funniest , movie ever . I'm actually looking forward to summer so we can work on this again . And the bloopers are < PROPFEMALE > . 
playing the guitar ... makes me wants to take a nap . I'm not giving in though . 
You're a drop in the RAIN , Just a number , not a NAME , And you don't see it . You don't BELIEVE it . At the end of the day , You're a needle in the hay , You signed and sealed it . And now you gotta DEAL with it . Humanity , Humanity . Goodbye . 
is listening to Satriani and then onto some Yngwie Malmsteen ... aahh ... * reclines back in chair to the sounds of ' With Jupiter in Mind ' * 
has noticed that watching Doctor Who consistently puts me in the mood to write . I wish I had something I was working on that fit that genre/tone more so that the mood could properly < PROPFEMALE > over .... 
Standing in the rain , with his head < PROPMALE > low Couldn't get a ticket , it was a sold out show Heard the roar of the crowd , he could picture the scene Put his ear to the wall , then like a distant scream He heard one guitar , just blew him away He saw stars in his eyes , and the very next day Bought a beat up six string , in a secondhand store Didn't know how to play it , but he knew for sure ... 
That game was EXCELLENT . Very intense . Canada kept pushing us to skate faster and made us keep picking up our game to the next level . USA victory 5-3 , and with an empty-netter too . And not to mention , beating Crosby really makes this win feel even BETTER . 
i feel like she sort of accomplished something today . Had a great nearly 4 hour lunch with Rohit , then studied Japanese and worked on some of my own projects . In store for the future : more studying of Japanese , working on stuff for Toracon ( thanks < PROPFEMALE > , I still feel bad about this ... ) , and working on more of my projects . Is hopeful things will get better in other areas of my life . 
Lately I've been measurin ' . Seems my time is growin ' thin . Wind me up and watch me spin ... Watch me spin ... Watch me spin ... Skin and bones , skin and bones , Skin and bones , don't you know ? Skin and bones , skin and bones , Skin and bones , don't you know ? I'm just skin and bones . 
And an old guitar is all he can afford , When he gets up under the lights to play his thing 
Cause I remember all the times that I tried so hard , And you laughed in my face , cause you held all the cards . I don't care anymore . And I really ain't bothered what you think of me , Cause all I want of you is to just let me be . I don't care anymore . Do ya hear ? I don't care anymore . I don't care what you say , I never did believe you much anyway . 
I really don't mind that Canada won . What I do mind , however , is that Crosby got the game-winning goal in overtime . He really does have an ego , and this is the last thing that we all needed- for it to get fed . Congratulations to the Canadian players with professional attitudes that the cameras don't stalk , you did really well . 
No matter how well I forget everything , You bring it crashing back down with one ring , Of my telephone ; had been docile all day . No matter , no matter how far away , I get from it all , By tooth and nail and claw , You're dragging me down . 
I'm just a dreamer , I dream my life away . I'm just a dreamer , who dreams of better days . I watch the sun go down like every one of us . Hoping that the < PROPFEMALE > will bring a sign . 
Pretty much perfect weather outside right now ! < PROPFEMALE > but the clouds make it NOT obnoxiously bright , slightly cool ( YES , 35 degrees is slightly cool for me ) , and slightly breezy . Not to mention I just bought gushers , two flavors of frozen lemonade , and successfully resisted buying two boxes of toaster strudels . Now ONWARD WITH THE DAY !! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Adventures season 1 complete !!!! Now commence the probable waiting for another 7 months to watch the next one . 
I had YET ANOTHER dream about AC/DC performing in the CCS gym . Except the gym was on the 2nd floor , and AC/DC was SO LOUD that they cracked a hole in the floor ! people downstairs were like >:-O but some came upstairs to watch . Before they could play DDDDC the CCS owner people told them they had to leave . BUT I got to talk to < PROPFIRST > before that and he was SO COOL ... and he gave me a hug . and < PROPFIRST > was with me !! 
working on some prints for Tora-con , then studying the crap out of Japanese . Then maybe starting on some commissions . Thanks to those of you who responded so quickly to my note . Whether you were tagged in it or not , please take a look >.< 
is awake ? And working on something ? And then going out somewhere ? ..... [ enough to like ? ] whoa . 
Rangers versus Sabres tonight ! LET'S GO ! 
can you say .... DUBIIIINSKYYY !?!? Tying it up with 1:26 on the clock , time for sudden death overtime , boys ! I could go for a shoot out right now ... 
>.< accidentally kept < PROPMALE > awake for like an hour past when he was going to go to bed . now he just stumbled away to go pass out @_@ .. whooops 
Come on baby finish what ya started , I'm in comPLEEEETE . That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted . I need some sympaTHHYYYY ! 
Miss the beat , you lose the rhythm . Nothing falls into place . Only missed by a fraction , slipped a lil ' off your pace . The more things you get the more you want ; just trade in one for another . Workin so hard to make it easier , whoa Gotta turn- c'mon!- turn this thing around Right now . Hey , s'your tomorrow ! Right now , c'mon it's everything ! Right now . Catch a magic moment , do it Right here and now . It means everything 
There's a time and place for everything , for everyone . We can push with all our might , But nothing's gunna come . Nothing's gunna change . And if I ask you not to try , would you let it be ? I want to hold you and say , We can't throw this all away , Tell me you won't go , won't go , Do you have to hear me say ...? 
well , I'm not sure who the Conductor is in The Visit , if it's a train conductor ( I know there's a scene at a train station ) or if it's a choir conductor ( i also know there's a choir ) , but whoever or whatever they are , apparently that's who I'm being in the play . 
played buhgasketball and < PROPMALE > Guglielmo got his revaaaahnge ! UUGGGHHHH ! * poke * also , < PROPFIRST > Senft apparently has two more hours of watch to Lost . 
Cause I feel you cross my mind , In dissarray , Intoxicated ricochet . There's nothing wrong . Just don't take too long . 
somehow , it is the 17th already . It feels like it was just < PROPMALE>'s birthday and now it's the middle of the month ? what the hell ... 
what a gorgeous day ... especially to buy < PROPFEMALE > green tinted sunglasses ! woot ! happy saint < PROPFIRST>'s day ya jerkbirds ! 
Sitting here with the windows open , and seeing the clear blue sky outside , and blaring < PROPFIRST > Halen has made me realize < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Roth was beyond right when he said that < PROPFIRST > Halen is a summer band . Their music coincides so well with nice weather !! Prolly better than any other band I've ever heard ! 
Rest in peace < PROPFIRST > Rhoads . died March 19th , 1982 . A huge loss to the world of heavy metal , and guitars in general . I can't imagine how much more talent and skill he'd possess today if he were still with us . 
What is meant to be , will be . Eventually . 
There was a time , when we sailed on together , Once in a dream , that we shared on the way . There was a place where we used to seek shelter . I never knew the pain of the price I would pay . 
Don't wait because I'm dreaming , of angels on the < PROPFEMALE > , Where everyone you know , Never leaves too soon . 
So with my promo code I can pre-order up to 4 tickets for The Scorpions . New dates for the US are still being released . I actually don't think the Times Union Center sells tickets through tickemaster , so if there's a date in the tour for Albany I won't be able to preorder . But we'll see what happens . I don't mind finding a way to get to an out of state venue ... 
If any website is the shit one every brick ( and this is RIT people , that's a lot of friggin bricks ) , that site would be Google . Or should I say Topeka . 
Just loves getting woken up throughout the night by horrible dreams .... three nights in one week . At least the kimono show is today . 
so today started out terrible , became really good , then went back to terrible . Honestly , minus the museum trip this has been a REALLY bad day -_- 
we'll you can tell everyone I'm a damn disgrace . Drag my name all over the place . I don't CARE anymore . I don't care anymore . And you can tell everybody ' bout the state I'm in , But you won't catch me cryin ' cuz I just can't win . I don't care anymore . I don't care no more . 
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON CHURCH IS MY FAVORITE RVB CHARACTER . Just watched Reconstruction and hooooly craaaaap .... I haven't gasped that loudly at an episode of something in FOREVER . PLOT CRAP . ( for souls ) 
LET'S go RANGERS !!!! 3-1 hells yeah !!!! 
Flyers had it tied up -- then GABORIK FROM NOWHERE !!! HOLY CRAP !!! WOOOOT ! 4-3 
BEST GAME I HAVE SEEN IN A DAMN LONG TIME . < PROPMALE > HENRIK , GABORIK , DUBINSKY , AND DRURY ! WOOOOOO !!! 4-3 , puts us in the running for THE EFFIN ' PLAYOFFS !!!!! Last game of the season is Sunday at 3 , and it's a DAMN big game ... LET'S ... GO .... RANGERS !!!!!! 
and thanks to Snoop Dogg being in the feild house , I can't get to my god damned atm . To put money in so I can order my Scorpions ticket . Which I wanted to do tonight . Before the REST of them get sold out . In closing , however much you thought I hated rap music , increase that by about 1000% 
Thought we'd win in that shootout . But damn , what an effort from Lundqvist . FORTY ... FOUR .... SAVES ... Man . Our offense lost too much energy in the 3rd period or I bet we'd have been on form and kept our lead/pulled ahead . Good season with a lot of fresh talent , which we'll be back with next year to try again . NY RANGERS FOREVER . 
has gone to the bathroom leaving her computer wiiiiide open ! :D :D :D All who read this can go lose the game . 
RIT people : Saturday night , go to Chill Beats . RIT's most awesome a cappella group 8Beat Measure is putting on a big concert at Ingle , doors open at 7:30 . $5 in advance if you know/find an 8Beat member and buy a ticket , $6 at the door . It's totally worth the money so be there ! ( this plugging was 100% shameless and of my own accord ) 
When the toll runs high and your spirit runs low , When you just want to lay where the tall grasses grow , Forget everything , let your spirit sing , Rest on my wings ... I'll fly you to where we remember , If you let yourself remember . 
And all the things I wish I had not said , Are played on loop til it's madness in my head . Is it too late to remind you how we were ? But not our last days of silence , Screaming , blur . Most of what I remember makes me sure , I should have stopped you from walking out the door . You could be happy , I hope you are . You made me happier than I'd been by far . 
making my sign for Chill Beats 2010 and waiting to find out if < PROPMALE > Yam and < PROPMALE > Saia are alive or not . GO TO CHILL BEATS !!! Ingle auditorium , $6 to get in to the best a cappella show you're gunna see this year . Think about why you're not going yet , then forget that crap and be there ! 8Beat Measure is awesome , don't miss out ! 
RIT Eight Beat Measure . Chill Beats 2010 . That is all . 
lunch with Rohit , Japanese class , then going to try to get this project looking presentable before class at 6 . Not sure it's possible ... 
There was a time when nothing ever really mattered , There was a time when there was nothing I didn't know , There was a time when I knew just what I was living for . There was a time , and the time was so long ago . There was a time , and the time was so long ago . 
made $47 at < PROPFEMALE > Con . would've made more if I'd had my prints ready ... ya know , like if I knew I had an artist'a table ? yeah ... oh well . Armcannon and being Kiki and chillin with < PROPFEMALE > made it worth it , but I now have so much to do and am so exhausted ... I basically am NOT going to be around for the next week due to perpetually being busy . 
weird day today , got to finally see Wazir < PROPMALE > Sookram ... why is it I only see him whenever I wear < PROPMALE>'s hat ? what the heck ... 
Sarge : \That was the worst driving of all time ! \ " Griff : \ " Because that wasn't DRIVING ! That was FLYING and BURNING !!! \ " Sarge : \ " Touche . \"" 
Things to know when exploring the RIT woods : 1 ) yellow and pink snails like to congregate on rocks , but you will get there too late to see anything but their broken shells , 2 ) There are two trees that are SO OLD , you don't even understand how old they are , 3 ) Streams eat sunglasses , but give $5 compensation , 4 ) If you can't cross the swamp ?! ... DON'T . and 5 ) The wheels on the bus don't move at all 
Look out , look out . The candyman . Here he comes , and he's gone again . 
Waking up to a thunderstorm at 10:30 am was actually a great surprise . Thunderstorms and rain are consistantly awesome writing weather and for some reason really inspire my imagination . Not sure why , but it's welcome nonetheless ! 
Orion is a masterpiece of instrumental metal wonderfulness 
needs the second season of MacGyver ... -_- hidbcvqla . cj hk , OGL JBCg ugjcb 
You could be happy And I won't know . But you weren't happy the day I watched you go . And all the things that I wish I h.a.d. n.o.t. s.a.i.d. , Are played on loop til it's m.a.d.n.e.s.s. in my head . Is it t.o.o. l.a.t.e. to remind you how we were ...? Most of what I remember makes me sure ... I should've stopped you from walking out the door ... 
FINAL FOR DRAWING : ( Portrait)\In\ 
Every few months I fall in love with AC/DC all over again . So goes the rock n roll train that is my life ... 
I saw AC/DC on August 2nd , 2009 , almost a year ago now ... but I've realized something important tonight . A part of me has never really left the Times Union Center , and I don't think it ever will . Greatest night of my life . 
< PROPFIRST > Alund is gunna be famous one day . He's going to be the world's leading forensic scientist as well as a popular guitar player known for his awesome playing and vocals and cool lyrics . In the meantime , I'll be a famous author and artist and we wil do famous people stuff together , because we are awesome . And < PROPMALE > Rock can come too :P 
Does anyone know of any places in or around Cohoes that are hiring ? I just checked several websites for businesses and found that they are either not hiring , not hiring foir positions I can do , or they have no application info on their site . 
Volo Endymionis somnum dormire 
needs to play a video game where there is either : a ) rock music , or b)killing things . now . I think i'm going to opt for A with a later infusion of B while listening to A 
PANAMA ! PANAMUH-HUH ! PAAANAMA ! PANAMUH-HUH-UH-HUH-UH-HUH ! ascvqowugcbojlbw < PROPFIRST > halen ausgcoliakshbciygq5thdimensionhqevcoqluw ! 
\How did you know ? \ " I asked in a surpried way . Voldemort got a ' DUDE you're so retarded!' look on his face . \ " I have telekinesis ! \ " he answered cruelly . ~ ~ quoted from Hellfire Commentary's dramatic reading of one of the worst < PROPMALE > Potter fan fictions ever . " 
Should be back tonight unless something else weird happens . Hopefully something else weird happens . 
Awake but tired . Prolly not going to be up for anything today , going to unpack and plan out commissions and my own projects . Possible plans for later dates are welcome and suggestions will be up for review . 
Open mic night at the Bread and Jam tonight . Going to finally see < PROPMALE > Rock , and going to watch < PROPFIRST > Alund performing some songs :D 
Had a great time at the bread and jam tonight . Delay due to the parade + < PROPFIRST > signing up last = long but fun wait , and I can't wait to see the videos we took :D Especially the one with the interruption VIA toilet paper . Quote of the night : < PROPMALE > Rock : \I wondaaaah ... if purses are ticklish ! \ " * tries to tickle my pocketbook * " 
My unconditional love for RIT is consistantly proven to be unrequited . 
I have this huge urge to re-read < PROPMALE > Potter , even though I just re-read the entire series last summer . 
raise your hand if you are frustrated beyond belief at the lack of information and procedure your college pre-emptively communicates with you . * raises hand * 
If you \like\ " this status I will post on your wall something I like about you . Make this your status if you want a challenge or are a jerkbird " 
I hate this house . I don't legitimately hate many things ... but I hate being in this house . I wish I had a job and an apartment . 
Lately I've been measurin ' . Seems my time i growin ' thin . Wind me up and watch me spin . Watch me spin . Watch me spin . 
Apparently today is national Slayer day , according to my radio station . In which you are supposed to blast Slayer as loud as ya can , all day . Yet I have not heard them play any Slayer those hypocrits ! 
House of Hair with < PROPFIRST > Snyder !! 10pm to 12pm on Q103 ! 
reasons to pull a pseudo all-nighter : 1 ) free beer and hot wings is on in a half hour so why bother , 2 ) I feel like working on something but don't know what , 3 ) nothing better to do ... 
* in the voice * said heylo to a recorded message on the voicemail of the daughter from < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Fagan Jr. the mother of the daughter , and once again realized that he is my mother . And he will go to mother's club cuz the fathers fish , and I will bake him a pie because he is hungry and if I do not do the pie-baking ( with the wolves howling ) then he will call my father because he is my mother . 
probably will not be able to take Japanese for winter OR spring quarter next year . < PROPMALE > classes are scheduled for the stupidest , most inconvenient and mismatched times , which make scheduling anything else ridiculous . RIT should probably make an effort to get on my good side . 
So apparently , my dog has a spinal condition , and some form of arthritis in her shoulder , AND a fever of 104 ( dog ' normal temperature is like 100 ) so she needs to take THREE medications now , two of them being twice daily . The dog's frikkin three years old . Wonderful . 
had a dream that I was with RIT people at a mall near school , and I found this gemstone store and I was looking around at all their awesome stuff , and the guy that worked there started talking to me and he realized I knew more about rocks than the other people that worked there , so he gave me a job O_o 
The present is the ever moving shadow that divides yesterday from tomorrow . In that lies hope . 
just played through all of solo career drums on AC/DC rockband -- again . And now listening to House of Hair with < PROPFIRST > Snyder til midnight . This is a just a rock and roll kinda night ! 
this is the first time I've ever screwed up a drawing so badly I had to use an exacto knife to cut OUT a chunk of the paper , and am now going to cut another peice of paper the exact same size and stick it in there O_o this is strange 
Happy 6 year anniversary of graduation to the 7 members of the last ever graduating class of CCS : < PROPFIRST > Alund , < PROPFIRST > Carknard , < PROPMALE > Benamati , < PROPMALE > Howe , < PROPFEMALE > KiKi Powers , < PROPFIRST > Sadler , and me . 6 years since we had reccess til 8th grade , watched < PROPMALE > mess with Mr. Merges , and threw plastic forks into sky lights . Mmkay ? 
looking up all the necessary driving directions for my road trip to NJ on friday . < PROPFEMALE > and The Scorpions . Three days . Most likely the first and last time I will ever see the greatest < PROPMALE > rockers of all time ; as for < PROPFEMALE > , I bet they'll be around for a while still :D but seriously THREE DAYS ... 
\cloud7791337 : ( 3:45:52 AM ) I need squidnunchucks\ 
Expect me to post a facebook note about the Scorpions within the next 48 hours . That is all . 
just got back from the Scorpions and < PROPFEMALE > in NJ ... what- a- show . Have a lot to say about it and a lot of stories , gunna write a facebook note today and post by tonight ( i hope ) . But first ... I should probably write the AC/DC one I promised like ... months ago . Yeeep .... 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Dio tribute on House of Hair tonight . pretty awesome , lots of great Dio hits , and recorded messages of condolences from different rock stars , supposedly there's gunna be clips from Dio interviews later ... prolly gunna be the best HOH I've heard in a long time . check it out on Q 103.9 , if your not local google House of Hair and see if it's on a station near you ( yes I like to advertise , leave me alone ) 
Sue : * playing shadow of the colossus , fighting #9 * \He's got like ... BALCONY for a FACE !!! \ " LMFHAO !!!!!!!! " 
< PROPMALE > Nugent = the loudest , craziest 62 year old ever . knocked out guy in street = .... BAHAHAHA yeah you totally deserved that you loser 
might finally have a job . 
just got an EXCELLENT review of the first chapter of < PROPMALE > by a 13 year old on a forum . Propmting me to make a couple HUGE changes ... I've literally got shivers right now , can't sit still . It was a terrible decision to check the forum before going to bed <_< now I can't sleep . Gotta work 
is really going to try to accomplish something with this first chapter . Diving in now , hopefully not coming up for air til it's finished . 
wants a day where I can get up when my alarm goes off without being so dizzy and feeling so much like crap that I actually can't get out of bed . so , once again , woke up hours later than i wanted to . awesome . and also , Happy 4th of July ! 
hopefully at some point today I can decide which one of my 80 projects I am going to work on .... 
MacGyver taught me that duct tape fixes everything . * looks at formerly broken chair in room , now standing and perfectly stable , duct tape in several spots * Well , whatya know . Tis true . 
shocked that I'm actually awake after only 3 hours of sleep . finishing packing and maybe outta here by 9:30 ? Sweet ! 
keeps thinking it's Monday . It feels like a Monday ... 
I think my favorite songs , are the ones we write on accident , because whatever is on purpose is never perfect 
I'm climbing the stairway to heaven , To ride on a crazy train , To hold a piece of liquid , To feel November rain . I want a minute in the limelight ; everybody wants some . But I'll wait , because the best is yet to come . And for now , I'm comfortably numb . 
Suggestions for potential Halloween costumes would be welcome . 
I want to get stuff done , but I don't feel like working on ANYTHING . I hate days like this , and how damn frequent they are this summer ... * grumble grumble * 
I think one day I want to try my hand at tattoo designs ... not only because it's cool , but searching tattoos on deviantart makes me lose faith in human beings power of choice and discretion . Some of those tattoos are RIDICULOUS and can not possibly be meaningful enough that they will be glad in 30 years that they got it -_- I hate when people get tattoos for NO REASON 
I love how all these news networks and websites are convinced that Producer < PROPFIRST > was actually a rabid , crazy < PROPFIRST > Lohan fan , and are referring to him as \that guy in the pink shirt\ " . Apparently there's tons of video clips of him interrupting everything ever ... he made it on all types of news stations and everything . Gunna be looking those up now . I love FB&HW =D " 
Can't believe how many changes I'm undertaking for my deviantART . It's already starting to pay off and it better continue to do so cuz this is a lot of work ! <_<; 
WHOA ... I just found my 8th grade report card , my scores from the Iowa Test , and all the awards I got at 8th grade graduation . The most entertaining thing to look at is definitely my grades for Science because I tell which quarter I helped < PROPFIRST > Sadler bug the crap out of Mr. Merges ; I got a \Needs Improvement\ " in the \ " Embodies Christian Behavior\ " category XD " 
< PROPMALE > from FBHW is telling a story about a seagull that got killed , and they said no one cares about seagulls . He THEN SAYS , AND I QUOTE , \It's like a Bluejay . No one cares because they're JERK BIRDS . \ " ......... FB&HWs JUST SAID JERKBIRDS !!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
is excited when < PROPFIRST > Halen comes on the radio XD 
After all this time of slowly watching episodes since 2007 ( not counting when I watched as a kid ) , I have finally finished watching Ronin Warriors . oh my god . That was a GREAT show , even though the dub changed all their names and virtues ... but I love the dub because of its corny early 90s dialogue XD And Anubis was the best character . AWESOMENESS ! 
C'mon baby finish whatcha started , I'm incompleeeeeete 
Ya know ... I really want facebook to add \cousin\ " as a possible family member ? Because then I could actually have real family members listed that I actually want other people to know that I'm related to . Yeah . lmfhao !! " 
Good day with the cousins minus the interesting guy on the bike that yelled out at me ... oh , Cohoes . Trying to finalize what my nickname for camp tomorrow is gunna be , then hopefully bed . Then working at camp from the crack of < PROPFEMALE > to early evening ... Hopefully it goes well . 
First day down , four more to go of working at this camp . < PROPFEMALE > Matthews you will be pleased to know that the entire staff of a camp and 7 children know me as Kojo now . 
home -- yes , home -- and feeling like crap . that's also the reason for being home . Two more days of camp left . 
Hmm ... is estimating that I fell asleep at 5:45 pm , very shortly after getting home from work . And now I am awake for the day . Sleeping for over 12 hours is a beautiful thing ; except when you have a dream where you find out you have to work on saturday and cancel all your plans for the day . And wait , I had a dream about Sailor < PROPFEMALE > and vampires ?! ... * shakes head * 
MY PHONE IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE . I'm not sure if it even ever will be again . We also have no house phone anymore so there is no way to contact me except the internet . I'm not sure if our phones are ever going to be turned back on or not , and if they are , WHEN that day is is a mystery to me , so for now if you need to talk to me it's going to have to be AIM or facebook . 
Again , MY CELL PHONE IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE . DEAD . GONE FOR NOW , MAYBE FOREVER . It appears I can receive calls but I am NOT SURE if doing so will run up the < PROPMALE > even more ; I can NOT make any calls . I can not text or receive texts . If you want to contact me , use the internet . Please do not randomly show up at my house , because I am probably working ; once again , I'm online so use the internet . Thank you , that is all . 
So in the end , I will be what I will be . 
doing some stuff and things here at home , then going over to do more stuff and things at < PROPFEMALE>'s house 
had a good night visiting Dad at the firehouse and hanging around there . talked to < PROPMALE > about < PROPMALE > haha , and of course they got two calls while I was there ... that's been the trend this summer , they have a slow day til I show up . 
\Tell me one last thing 
And after probably more than 30 times of watching The Breakfast Club , I still notice new things when I re-watch it . Phenomenal . I love < PROPFIRST > Hughes films . 
Bread and Jam Cafe is closing down for good as of Friday . I have not gotten an ounce of good news lately .... This is terrible . 
Leaving tomorrow . 
I wonder if < PROPMALE > got lost or is dead ... huh . maybe I should sit outside ? or maybe he's a cat and shouldn't be driving anyway because HE'S A CAT 
Playing guitar , unpacking more things/rearranging , and waiting for < PROPMALE > to get here and apparently there's a ginormous party here tonight ? O.o AND < PROPFIRST > WHEN DO YOU SHOW UP , < PROPFIRST > ?! You have to come over < PROPFIRST > ! 
OH MY GOD , OH MY GOD ..... HOLY CRAP ..... < PROPFIRST > BOUGHT ME A 3-MONTH PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP FOR DEVIANTART !!!!!!!!! YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME .... 
Watching I Love < PROPFEMALE > , eating chicken and fries shaped like smiley faces , and going to class at 2 . Yup . I'm back at college . 
did two good deeds today and got negative in return . and i'm sick of it . Catch up with me already , < PROPFEMALE > . 
So , anyone have an extra Beginning Japanese workbook that has the pages for chapters 7 through like ... 11 left in it ? And want to give it to me ? That would be cool . 
alright , < PROPFEMALE > . I'll take that as step one and one and a half towards making things better . Thanks . 
My people are the misfits , \ 
The ones that don't fit in , \ 
With the smile I know it comes within 
Great White is an underrated band . everything I've heard by them is awesome , yet I never hear about them 
my icecube is meeeeltiiiing ! 
Is anyone else's facebook screwing up ? Mine is only showing me news feed stuff from 3 weeks ago or more . Most of it says , \2 months ago\ " or even 3 . and there's no option to show recent stuff like there used to be on the top right . and my ice cube is still melting ! " 
So from experience , everyone should watch The Lost Room . That's the best thing I've watched in a long time . Thanks for the suggestion < PROPFIRST > ! 
Wow , so filming today went way better than I ever expected . Thanks < PROPFIRST > Green , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Tufano , < PROPFIRST > Lynk , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > the cat for helping at the LAST MINUTE and being amazing . If only we had gotten < PROPFIRST>'s intense action scene moves on film ... And thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Azzolini for being awesome ! Can't wait to see the footage in class ! and PS : < PROPMALE > is in love with the sentinel 
DREAM LAST NIGHT : * < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > are drilling < PROPFIRST > w/ questions * \ 
< PROPFIRST > : \Listen . I'm sick of you guys and your ... introduction ! \ " \ 
hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi 
hi this is < PROPFEMALE > hi 
this is definitely not < PROPMALE > hi 
is randomly pumped about the Scorpions concert again even though it was in June XD * watches things on youtube * 
finally almost has her room organized ! but the walls are still blank :/ 
apparently , in the dream world , I am a bad ass that kicks random chicks out of our apartment , and < PROPMALE > sends < PROPMALE > 5 crates of apples cuz he figured < PROPMALE > would want them . Riiiight .... 
the next few days = busy . but at least i am 1/2 way done with my Samurai Champloo/Cowboy Bebop drawing 
okay . So i guess I don't have to go to the labs . My computer finally decided it would let me install a trial of CS5 . I guess the other 4 times it didn't work were figments of my imagination . Well , then . 
Same old song , Just a drop of water in an endless sea . All we do , crumbles to the ground , but we refuse to see . 
did I just ... finish my project ? ... idunno either . I'm going to go ahead and submit it now anyway before I wake up from this crazy dream . 
I create myself . I take the words ... I scatter them , in time and space . 
Hockey season cannot start soon enough !! but then again , yes it can , because Drury will most likely be out for a bit of the start ... 
first pre-season game tonight at 7 against NJ . can't wait to see what goes down 
it's nice winning in pre-season against jersey . Let's see if we can do it again Saturday . new guys like Frolov lookin pretty good 
< PROPMALE > ZOTTO just brought it HOME in OT . final score 5-4 against the Devils . that's what I like to see . 
today is really a Def Leppard kind of day ... 
ritz crackers , ny rangers , and fairly easy Japanese homework . not bad . Let's see if we can't beat the Red Wings though ... they're looking pretty sharp tonight . 
i can not BELIEVE Anisimov and Christensen just scored and tied that up . 3-3 ! 
I am starting to wonder if Mondays are cursed . Things always seem to go wrong on Monday ... 
Jupiter Jazz 1 & 2 really are the best episodes of Cowboy Bebop . Though Ballad of Fallen Angels , and The Real Folk Blues 1 & 2 are too good to be discounted 
Ended up only having one class today instead of three . Time to do the online < PROPMALE > History midterm before it's due at 9 , doing the source notebook in there at some point , then concept sketches , then finishing Japanese homework . So I guess it's a good thing class got cancelled . 
on FreeBeerandHotWings.com, a recap of the show : \Zane and his daughter are convinced that the house is haunted because\ 
there is so much insanity going on with the Cohoes fire department right now . I actually wish I was home to see first hand what's going on . 
and it's finally October . best month of the year , onward ! 
\If your mother\ 
making things and stuff and majigs 
< PROPFIRST > pilgrim = melting brain > having thoughts 
\He looked like a mole man . But not in a bad way ! \ " ~ Matt < PROPMALE > " 
I am sick of these people bashing the Cohoes fire department . It's disgusting me that they're disgusted . You don't see anyone complaining about doctors making a lot of money , and they're saving lives too ; except usually not at their own risk . People need to grow up and get over themselves . Yes high wages for city workers raise taxes , but don't personally bash those who work to save your life , family , and property ! 
Does anyone remember the Halloween party I had at my house in 3rd grade ? Where we had a haunted basement ? Everyone was afraid to go down into it so we hid in my room instead . When we finally did go , there was a strobe light flashing and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Maloney tackled one of the \monsters\ " in the back room . I don't remember if he got in trouble .... but it was awesome XD " 
feeling awful ... hopefully watching the movies in class today will be fun . And then later I get to make everyone watch my movies from class ! hopefully i'm feeling better by then -_-; 
Okay . Finally back . Now to do tons of work on deviantART and find food before I pass out ! and Halloween shopping tomorrow !! yaaaaaaaay 
Halloween shopping went well . < PROPMALE > and I saw about 1,000 things for < PROPFIRST > , including a dead guy on a pony , and the wind was awesome , and I spent way too much money . But it was wicked fun and I bought stuffs ! hoo < PROPFIRST > ! 
Confusion creeps in me , raining down . Gotta get to you , but I don't know how . Call me , call me . Let me know you are there . \ 
Please won't you come and ease my mind ? Reasons for me to find you ... What can I do , to get me to you ? 
the first Rangers game of the season is juuuust about to start ! can not wait ! 
final score 6-3 in favor of the Rangers . The Sabres just seemed off tonight ... but I'm glad to see us get a win in our first game ! Stepan with that hat trick , just wow . Can you imagine the 1st three goals of your NHL career being a hat trick ?! 
came up with some great ideas for a new story thing and wrote em all down ... now time to do homework and get ready for 2 midterms tomorrow ! and why do I still want ice cream ?! hi . again . ( don't ask ) 
I have taken one bite of this sandwich , but I am already in love . Chicken and mushrooms sauteed in butter and < PROPFEMALE > with provolone cheese and cream cheese on wheat = YES . best idea of the day ! 
\Did I ever tell you about < PROPMALE > club in high school ? It was the only club I was ever really in . But not really . \ " ~ Me trying to describe my relationship/involvement with < PROPMALE > club " 
definitely convinced Brenden that he had telekinesis for about 4 seconds . I am very proud of this accidental development XD 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is like the Draco Malfoy of the New York Rangers ... and even though he does the occasional thing to piss me off , I freakin love this guy . tied 3-3 in the third , we'll see where the heck this goes ! 
that was the latest I've stayed up in months and the latest I've woken up in weeks . Crap ... but at least we watched hilarious videos last night , and ridiculous tv shows 
i give up . I'm going to bed . 
I had a dream that I played a game ( one my brain made up , except it was in great detail and all made 100% sense ) that I now like the idea for SO MUCH , that I'm writing it all down . I think this proves to me why I never feel rested when I wake up ; my brain is still functioning waaaaaay too well when I sleep . And it should stop that . 
if three of our best guys weren't injured , we'd be winning more games , cuz we have a really good team . at least Christensen is back ... 
today = yay because two classes got cancelled , but boooo because I have to write two essays , do source notebooks , do japanese work , and apparently have a headache . I've had way too many of them lately . I'm just waiting for my head to explode or something 
FINISHED MY TWO ESSAYS ! & got THUROUGHLY DISTRACTED by some strange crickety-like insect that went POOF and appeared ( practically ) on my blinds . I was going to catch it , but could not decide if I should stop and try to , or continue writing , so instead I stared at it trying to figure out what it was XD til < PROPMALE > came in and caught it for me cuz I was being dumb 
And even though the moment passed me by , I still can't turn away . Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose , Got tossed along the way . Letters that you never meant to send , Get lost or thrown away ... 
So for Survey of Western < PROPMALE > and Architecture , did ANY one else have to write 5+ essays ? Two essays for the first midterm , which we are emailed and given 24 hours to do , two for the second midterm ( same format ) , and 1 writing assignment that's worth 25% of the grade for the class ? Not to mention whatever the final is ( maybe two more essays ? ) ?? 
You have to love barely getting any sleep so that you can wake up to get into winter courses , only for the registration system to experience \technical difficulties\ " for at LEAST a half-hour . Why am I fightning so hard to stay at this school when it seriously hates me ? I hate this . " 
today really is just a fail day . ......... oh , wait , that's riiiight ... WHAT day is it ?! MONday . FRIGGIN ... MONDAY . Curse of the FREAKIN MONDAYS strikes again !!! 
I am making it my mission right now to remind everyone of something awesome/stupid they've said . Many people reading this will get a wall post within the night . ( aka , i just updated the quotes site and got blackholed by it XD ) 
Oh my god , it is SO close to Halloween ! XD 
cleaning the kitchen finally . which means all the shit from the kitchen is in the living room . there was way too much useless shit in our kitchen . 
October 1st , 2009 : * at DnD*\ 
Pietr : * to < PROPFIRST > , who has just gotten his rat * \Can ya do rat things with it ? \ " \ 
Waiting for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > to get here and hoping they don't die on the way ! or die by the sea , with the < PROPFEMALE > ketchup bottle and < PROPMALE > Barker . and whatever else the heck we said was by the sea ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are here and they didn't die on the way ! even though they collapsed onto the couches when they got here yesterday but it's cool . Today = going to the mall , eating stuff , more decorating , and possibly playing games and such ?! 
Happy Halloween everyone ! I cannot WAIT to see everyone's costumes today ! :D 
Thanks to everyone for an awesome Halloween ! I hope everyone had a good time ! 
L M F H A O ! I just had an entire conversation with < PROPFIRST > through my window that included shooting him with a nerf gun and him throwing the bullets up at me , and me dropping his camera to him . I felt like I was Repunzel up in a tower or something ; but I bet she didn't have a nerf gun or a puh < PROPFIRST > . 
i've had enough of being sick . it's preventing me from doing things like life 
\I'm never coming over here AGAIN ! ... see you guys tomorrow ! \ " ~ Matt < PROPMALE > on his way out our door " 
Got challenged to this , but I altered it : Like this & I'll tell you : 1 ) Something I've learned about you recently , 2 ) The color you remind me of , 3 ) One of my favorite quotes you've said , 4 ) An animal you remind me of , 5 ) Something\ 
I'd like to ask you , 6 ) My favorite thing about you , 7 ) An inside joke we have , & 8 ) Something crazy/impossible I can imagine you ( or us ) doing if we could 
just helped Rohit make his cooostuuuume ! It looks friggin AWESOOOOME ! but it's still not doooone yeeeet ! gunna keep makin ' fire flooooweeeers ! yeah that was sposed to be a song . Deal with it . 
just got to turn < PROPFIRST>'s hair into the 10th Doctor's XD and might have took a long time on purpose because it was FUN . good thing < PROPFIRST > took so long to suggest using a hair dryer ... 
RIT Eight Beat Measure did a great job at Acapellaween tonight !! Congratulations on a job well done , and congrats Rohit Crasta !! you're awesome and the concert rocked ! XD 
it has just occured to me that part of the reason I have felt so crappy lately is probably because I have not been listening to enough music . 
starting over again isn't an option . so what do you do ? you just have to figure it out . It gets to a point where no one can fix the problem except for yourself , and even if you don't know how , you have to go it alone . even if it's just to prove to yourself that you can . 
I feel the cold wind blowin ' , beneath my wings , It always leads me back to sufferin ' ... 
I am sick of not being able to sleep . 
and finally , I will try to go to sleep . And it better work . Or else . 
waking up at 4:17 pm is a funny thing . shower , food , then labs all day to get as MUCH work done as possible . Hoo . < PROPFIRST > . 
* every 5 minutes or so in the labs * \ 
Frank : * turns to < PROPFEMALE > * \DO YOUR DAMN WORK !!!!! \"" 
I am so proud of the emails that I send out . You know , the ones that don't say they're from me and say they're from someone else . Yeah those ! gotta love it ! 
Frank : * talking about the people who liked his pony status * \These people just wanna see me get tortured . \ " \ 
The decisions you make in a single day have the power and curse of being able to change the course of your life . It's not just something that's reserved for main characters in movies , cartoons , and novels ... it's actually true . And you're living it right now . 
i really needed the Rangers to win tonight , so thank god they did . Crazy game towards the end there , but 3-2 in overtime is fine by me . I was surprised at Lundqvist throwing the stick though ... 
hates existing right now 
and in one fell swoop , I screw up everything . Okay , well , maybe two fell swoops . ... either way , everything's still screwed up 
finished with everything and finally awake , and now , to work on my own stuff and watch a hockey game ... 
so this is the first time in years that I have missed the midnight premier of a < PROPMALE > Potter movie :/ I don't ... REALLY care , but it's more weird than anything else . Considering there's only one more time after this that it will ever happen , I should make it a point to actually go to the last one 
home . Thanks , < PROPMALE > . 
it has been so long since I've been able to listen to Q103 during the weekdays and hear Mrozek's mystery riff . I am excited for this . 
things that will happen ( maybe ) by the time we're all 50 : we will reach epic tier in DnD , I will graduate from RIT finally , and < PROPFIRST > will play Mass Effect 3 . 
buying Warhead sour popsicles for $1 at walmart was a delicious decision . 
going out soon for the now-traditional lunch with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is probably the only person I know who could have something in her pocket and wonder if it is a piece of SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN . ..... for the record , it was NOT . XD 
... yup . 
why is class tomorrow already ? this is dumb . D.U.M. dumb 
* on the quarter mile*\ 
Jason : \Frank 
yup . I am done watching the hockey game . that is how much it SUCKS right now . I'm so glad I rushed back to watch it . 
sleep . 
Rock and roll ain't no riddle , man ; to me it makes good , good sense . 
listening to people do math makes me glad that math and I reached an understanding long ago ; that we would stop trying to understand each other . 
i'm sick of feeling like I'm getting no rest ... especially after I just slept for that long . ... Maybe I slept TOO long . What a bunch of crap . 
hat trick for Gaborik ! score 6-5 , holy crap .... 
bad wolf 
is on < PROPFIRST>'s computer about to work on something COOOOOL ! and watching the hockey game and SHEESH this friggin keyboard -- !! not even just the spacebar , but the keys feel like they're in weird spots ! 
I just keep making the most awesome things in photoshop . Honestly , I am proud of myself XD 
the snow outside is all like FAAWOOOOOoooooOOOOOSH ! ... just sayin . 
... ow . my everything . :/ 
The best part of Christmas is giving gifts , and let me tell ya ... I came up with some damn good ideas for presents this year for some of you people out there . I am effin ' proud of myself ! 
< PROPMALE > hates the hedgehog =( but apparently it's a magical karma-activater , so it's all good 
Photoshop and I have been getting along quite well lately . Add AC/DC into that mix and wow ... Somehow I'm in a great mood while in class . That's a novel experience . 
workwwork work work work workwork work 
I want time to pause for a while . It's not the first time I have , but time doesn't care what I think . 
turning up the volume on some < PROPFIRST > Frampton while I work on stuff , things , and majigs . 
... I think < PROPFIRST > is going crazy lately . He's starting to act like ME !! 
no sleep except a nap from 9:30 am- 11:30 am + got stuff in the mail + finishing an X-Mas present + prolly other stuff = FRIGGIN HAPPINESS ( somehow ) 
if anyone at RIT would like to donate some food to me , particularly anything I don't have to cook , like fruit and microwavable stuff , and orange juice , I would probably love you forever . If I already DO , then , ya know ... I'll love you even more , or something like that . 
finishing making secret stuff !! and then wrapping the secret stuff !! and then doing things and stuff , and then early Christmas ! 
is it possible to sleep in this house without having a sore throat and clogged sinuses every time I wake up ? I'm going to blame cigarette smoke ... 
okay . I'm going to attempt to get something done now ! we'll see how this goes 
Christmas shopping fail ... gunna have to go tomorrow too . 
YES !!!!! facebook added cousins ! Oh man , I have legitimately been waiting for this for forever ! If you're my cousin , watch out , cuz I sent you a request a majig ! 
working on Christmas stuff once again ! 
L M F H A O ! THERE IS A GUY .... ON BAKER AVE .... IN FULL < PROPFEMALE > SUIT ... WAVING AT CARS ... HE IS STANDING ON HIS OR SOMEONE ELSE'S LAWN . THIS . IS . HILARIOUS . 
about to change the strings on my guitar . I half want to keep the old ones just to prove how craptastically worn down they are ! maaaaybe I will .... maaaaybe I will ..... P.S. : Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Gleason ! 
i am soooooo tired right now and i have no idea why .... 
The Cohoes FD really stepped it up to help the families who were victims of the Main Street fire . They deserve a lot more credit than the city sometimes gives them . 
needs about another month off from school . That would be great ... 
I'm kind of thinking that it's time to draw some < PROPMALE > Potter fan < PROPMALE > . The last time I did was like .... 7th grade or something . 
* sleeps * 
I know now what trouble can be , And why it follows me so easily .... Let me introduce you to the end 
is writing about some of the best times from ten years ago , and is listening to 90s music . Wow . 
Not only did I have a dream about < PROPMALE > Potter that was WAY too in depth , but I then had a dream that I woke up at 5:45 and missed my class . When I actually woke up , I believed it and went back to sleep , but thankfully not til 5:45 . what the heck ... 
..... I should go to bed . So should < PROPFIRST > . 
and now this is when I go drown myself in the shower . 
okay . this photoshop project actually looks halfway decent , but guess what ? FRIGGIN SLEEP . 
I do enjoy getting out of class 1.5 hours early , after sitting here for 2 hours waiting to see if we would actually do anything , or just die of boredom ... 
instead of going to bed , I will watch random stuff and work on something in photoshop and eat sour patch kids 
well the day started off awesome , but now it's equivalent to this face --> -_- 
there's this thing called sleeping ? that , ya know , some people do sometimes when the sun goes away each day and doesn't tell us where it's going ( < PROPFIRST > Black reference ) . maybe I should try that now ... 
is quite tired , but also rather happy 
< PROPFIRST > my words , I will get a new guitar one day ! and it will be one with non-shitty machine heads ! 
\Without music ... life would be a mistake . \"" 
well , facebook finally forced the new profile on me , I had no choice . Gotta love having options . assholes . 
is going completely crazy . 
wow . Good morning , I guess . What the hell happened ...? 
feels like crap . ow . 
I need to figure out a hell of a lot more than I thought . But for now , I will read one chapter of this book . 
< PROPMALE > comes home with interesting things sometimes .... 
today kind of equaled fail so far , but it could have failed even more than it did , so I guess it's alright >.< 
had a dream about finding old pictures from Cohoes Catholic , but it was very difficult to make them out because they were faded and the colors went weird . But I could tell that some of them were from various Halloween parties cuz everyone was wearing costumes . Interesting ... 
holy shit , lemons are soooooo goooooood . at this moment they are my favorite fruit . 
Is going to ..... edit < PROPMALE > ? whoa ... 
Or not . okay . 
Oh my god , what this book needed all along was a prologue . This is friggin awesome ! 
quesadilla from < PROPFIRST>'s , more < PROPFEMALE > , a free green ribbon and lollipop , and listening to old Free Beer and Hot Wings clips before getting to down to work . Not a bad day so far . 
a win for the Rangers in a shoot out , holy shit Wolski with that gorgeous fake out !!! But Anisimov brought it home ! SWEEET ! 
finished writing prologue , and now it is time to pass out ! 
MY FLOWERS ARE GROOOWWIIIIIING !!!! XD 
that dream was so weird , that I actually am not even sure what was going on in it . but that lady was weird and that place sucked . 
So , question : if I were to make a couple Pokemon bookmarks for Toracon ( first generation and MAYBE some second gen , maybe ) what Pokemon what people suggest I do ? It seems like a lot of people like Squirtle and Gengar ... Any other suggestions ? 
okay . I can deal with seeing vanilla flavored hot chocolate in stores ... but now the exact phrase \hot vanilla\ " is used in another BOOK ?! Why did I think I was so creative when I made that up in my story ? Obviously everyone else on the damn planet already invented it -_-" 
I wish I had my Pokemon handbooks from like 4th grade at school with me ... why did I ever think I wouldn't need them ?! shows how much I'VE learned from college . 
just submitted some poetry to Signatures . this should be interesting ... 
i really hate registration right now ... being awake right now is making me feel sick . i need to go back to sleep T_T 
I think I have finally found a shoe that fits . And no , I don't mean literally . It's called a metaphor . 
Yes ! Chickenfoot is coming out with a second album !! 
how have I survived this long without playing my guitar ? well , I'll tell you : I HAVE NO IDEA !!!!! I really need my guitar to stop being a complete ass . dfyrtwscgviogvhrshoi 
Who can answer these questions about me , without answering the same way as the person before you ? : A nickname I have____ One of my favorite colors ? ____ My favorite holiday ? ____ Favorite sport to play ? ____ My favorite shows ? ___ Something stupid or ridiculous I've said ? ____ My hobby ? ____ A favorite band ? ____ Something I hate ? ___ Something I love ? ___ My most important possession ? ___ Something random about me ? ____ 
was it worth staying up til 6 in the morning to draw my first piece of < PROPMALE > Potter fan < PROPMALE > since like , 7th grade ? ..... actually , yes . I am going to practice more with this style ... but uh ... LATER . For now , BED !!!!!! 
food , doing stuff/research to give to my adviser , washing dishes , hockey game , more food , the rest of hockey game and hopefully watching us win , and then movie night with Brenden ! 
1 second on the clock , we shoot , and goddamn we would have scored if the puck had been an inch over . Bounced right off the post . I have never , ever seen anything that close , with LITERALLY 1 second on the clock . That game just missed going into OT by a HAIR . 
I had so many different things I could do , but then realized there was a hockey game on . now I don't have to make a decision ! 
wow . good morning ... 
so today was pretty good , I got to give < PROPFIRST > his awesome stuff and card , got to make fun of football and eat free food even tho it wasn't that great , and best of all , got to read the greatest story ever written to < PROPFIRST > and company . And it was enjoyed by all for many minutes . ESPECIALLY by < PROPFIRST > !! seriously , i swear 
Google is awesome today !! 
Oh right . I spose I should eat something other than ice cream for dinner ... ..... Today's WEIRD . 
Sometimes you need to stop doing what's expected of you , in order to find out what's expected from yourself . 
whyyyyyyYYYYyyyy am I still awake and not too tired after pulling an all nighter last night ?!? Usually I can't even make it THROUGH an all nighter and end up passing out ! stranger things have happened I guess ... 
I do not comprehend how I have not passed out yet from exhaustion or why there is a lack of said exhaustion . I've been up for 36+ hours . I need to just try to go to sleep and see what happens cuz this is bad .... Goodnight world , of people who are probably still sleeping ! 
3,500 + views on deviantART now = happiness . Especially since apparently I got 26 views yesterday ! that's pretty good for me 
Why are my grandparents so awesome ? Oh , right , because they're my awesome grandparents . Duh . 
WOOOO WON IT IN THE SHOOTOUT , AND AN AWESOME FREAKIN ' SHOOTOUT , TOO ! Christensen and Zuccarello did some damn fancy work to get that puck . I took some screen shots , still have to go through and see if they're any good . 
But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell , I know , right now ya can't tell . But stay a while and maybe then you'll see , A different side of me . I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired , I know , right now you don't care . But soon enough , you're gunna think of me . And how I used to be ........ 
tonight's dinner : bottle of water , popcorn , jelly beans , and sour patch kids . and now to find something for dessert ... 
i don't know if having Matchbox 20 on while working is helping me or distracting me . But I bet if I put on anything 70s-80s it will distract me more ... Matchbox 20 it is , then . 
today is really , really stupid . < PROPFEMALE > much I need to get done .... 
Thank god the Rangers just won in the shootout . Literally the only good thing that happened today ! 
definitely just forgot where I was and had like a half hallucination that if I didn't turn down < PROPFIRST > Black , my mom would hear him screaming the F word . Listen , self . You . Are . Not . In . Cohoes . You are delusional . Finish work faster so you can effing SLEEP . 
when the EFF am I going to be done doing this stupid work ?? I want to sleep so badly ..... 
TO ANYONE I SAID I WAS GOING TO < PROPFEMALE > OUT WITH THIS WEEK : it's not going to happen -_- I'm going to be working all night tonight as well . And I'm leaving either tomorrow or saturday ; if leaving saturday , probably working on friday . Sorry . Catch me next quarter I guess . 
this weather is just DUMB . It's bad timing for like , everyone who wanted to drive home/drive here today . 
1 ) the Rangers kicked ass tonight ; we picked up a win 6-0 over the Caps . 2 ) I'm done with all of my work , but not only does it not feel like I am ... I am going to continue working on other stuff that I actually feel like working on . I still feel the pressure of work , though . Prolly won't go away til half way through break .... 
Just walked around like all of Cohoes with < PROPMALE > , showing him Remsen street and random crap that I thought was important . and now .... * collapses onto bed * 
Got a B in Writing Seminar ! WOOOOOOOOOO !!! Definitely thought I was gunna get a C in that . So now just waiting for Intro to Computer Imaging .... 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!! 
There is always at least one totally mutilated skittle in every pack . And when you pour them out to eat them and see it , you're always like , \Wtf happened to THIS one ?!?! \ " and then you eat it anyway . " 
everything seems to hurt right now ... hopefully sleeping will help and I can wake up feeling better .... 
is figuring out all of the classes for my 2nd professional core of my new < PROPMALE > ... this is actually harder than I thought since I'm finding that I have to limit myself . Argh .. 
okay . my mom just asked me for the 3rd time today how my oatmeal was . I ate that oatmeal 3 hours ago , so that's once per hour . I think she's losing it . 
I'm sick of not getting anything done this week , so I'm going to change that right now . 
why .... the eff .... are classes starting tomorrow already ? 
Needs to find something to do to re-unwind . 
got out of my studio class a few hours early , so working on my own stuff before I have to do homework .... 
is enjoying sitting in her living room , watching < PROPFIRST > . He is sitting here with earbuds in , listening to music and dancing around . I don't think he knows he's entertaining me , but well , he is . 
is sitting with < PROPFIRST>'s lawyer waiting for < PROPFIRST > to deny or confirm allegations . 
why ... am I STILL ... not in Multidisciplinary Studies yet ? Now I think I may have to wait another 2 weeks . guh ... 
I remember going to google to look up something about < PROPMALE > supplies . So how did I end up on the Rangers website , looking at t-shirts ? Idunno , but I like it . 
Well , there was no point in staying campus-side today because apparently my 2 o'clock class has been canceled . If I had known this sooner , there would not have been a need to wander the < PROPFEMALE > aimlessly for so long looking for somewhere to sit ! blargh 
\Go to your profile The first 5 friends in the sidebar are your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse How screwed are you ? \ " \ 
Alright . Last new class of the week is tonight and I get to see if it's derpy or not . 
Just had a conversation on deviantART with a totally random Finnish photojournalist about how epic the Scorpions are , and how they're going to be photographing them in 4 months at their last ever concert in Finland . This is why the internet is good . 
* after dealing with a strangely limited set of colors , and a randomly leaking marker*\ 
Krystal : \Why are all of my < PROPMALE > supplies misfits ?! \ " \ 
Today is a day ! 
Just got a free micron pen from Barnes and < PROPMALE > because they forgot to ring it up . Throw that in with all the money I saved on textbooks today , and I'm doin ' pretty good 
myyy scaaaanneeeeeer : < 
It's pretty weird watching a shootout at 1:10 am , but what the hell ... when we win , I'm not going to complain ! Lundqvist was superb tonight . 
well ... at least my scanner works now ! I only had to play around with it for an hour <_< 
blasting Hotel California while I do everything ever on deviantART 
has a friend on deviantART ( outside of those I know in real life ) that isn't a total creep ! Hoo < PROPFIRST > !

Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day 
Here's something I find extremely annoying on facebook : when you comment on my status with a question to me ( or someone else commenting ) that has NOTHING to do with my status . I see it all the time on other people's too , and I HATE it . PLEASE . STOP . NOW . I will no longer answer any comments like this , I am GOING to delete them . 
is sitting in the labs making a website for my book , which is going to end up being my big project for this class . If I could apply my own projects/things I actually cared about to ALL of my course assignments , I bet I'd have straight A's . 
is back from class and is now going to work on my book , eat ice cream , and hopefully sleep for once . 
Today has the kind of weather that makes me want to play \Sultans of Swing\ " and \ " Free Bird\ " on loop . And pretty much anything by < PROPFIRST > Halen . " 
best trip to < PROPFEMALE>'s ...... EVER . The . End . 
Today is the anniversary of the death of < PROPFIRST > Rhoads ... I had totally forgotten until right now . RIP to one of the best guitarists in the history of metal . 
alright .... FINALLY got photographs of my still-life that are good enough to start this drawing ... 
finally has gotten commissions through deviantART ! Took you darn people long enough XD 
SOMEONE ON DEVIANTART DONATED A 1 YEAR PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP TO ME ANONYMOUSLY O_o bahsbcgvuascdeajnsoviicncwugbaanxjutfdc 
I should really stop looking at cosplays on deviantART , because it's REALLY , REALLY making me want to make a costume . Something which I neither have the time or money to do . And anyway these people on devaintART are completely insane when it comes to their stuff , to the point where they look like the jumped straight out of the show/movie <_< 
let's see if I can make it through today ... 
Made it through the first half of the day , and now to see if I can survive a four hour class . 
OMFG . everyone in the library STFU . This floor is for quiet study , so get the HELL off your cell phone , stop laughing like we're at a comedy show , and STOP ... SLAMMING .... YOUR CRAP .... ONTO THE TABLE . JBDCVYQUWSXNMQWIHEBCNQXMQIEYVCBQIWX 
just had a random epiphany about what the cover of my novel should look like . Why didn't I think of this before ? 
I would totally go see Great White in concert . Speaking of which , I could really use another good rock concert ... 
How many times do you have to tell someone to STOP dragging you into the middle of things before they'll actually shut up and get it ?

Got my 3rd commissioner on deviantART =) Once I finish the three drawings I have left to do for the commissioners , I can re-open commissions there and hope for some more . And once I'm home for the summer I can work on < PROPFIRST > Murphy's freakin epic AC/DC poster !! 
Just won in the shootout , those were 2 big points , and we really needed them . Now , if only < PROPFEMALE > and Buffalo weren't playing each other later ... I really don't want EITHER of them to win . vdcqenodqsu 
If you ever have an idea you think might be good/cool , just run it past < PROPMALE > Monasch , because he is a good idea judger person , and will help you elaborate and come up with more cool stuff . Even if it ends up taking over an hour and then you lose your voice . 
Hopefully by the end of the night I will have paypal set up on deviantART so that people can buy my bookmarks or donate to me .

Here's to hoping that everything goes the way I need it to right now , or I'm going to end up completely screwed . I really don't want to go into it right now/explain , but I could use all the positive energy I can get , so keep me in your thoughts . 
I could have left class 2 hours or more ago , but stayed to work on my website . Holy crap ! That amazi -- wait , never mind , it's a website about my book . No longer surprised . 
today has been ....... you know what . I don't even know .... 
Suck it , Devils . Now to see if Tampa Bay has the motivation to beat < PROPFEMALE > tonight . Either way , this year has been a great one , we had a lot of amazing talent on our team and it was really all the injuries that held us back . Go NY Rangers !! 
I love within one minute of < PROPMALE > walking into the apartment , we're already plotting . 
EFF YOU NEW JERSEY , EFF YOU < PROPFEMALE > , AND THANK YOU KINDLY TAMPA BAY ... WE ARE IN THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR !!!!! The Capitals better watch themselves , because IT IS ON !!! 
I think that whoever likes this sudden unwanted burst of 70+ degree temperatures should move south and take this weather with them . Leave those of us who like milder seasons alone ! Spring is supposed to be warmer than winter , but it's not summer yet , goddamn it , so QUIT IT 
\Think of how stupid the average person is 
Just found a crap load of old pictures that are sure to embarrass everyone . I'll be uploading them soon , never fear ! 
I have the best profile picture in the universe right now . And nothing any of you can do or say will convince me otherwise !!!!! 
The Usual Suspects has a great plot twist . Just saying . 
wow , everything is a pain in the ass right now , including the playoffs . Damn it . 
hihihihihihihithisisdefinitelykrystalbutnothi . hihihi . hi . hihihihihi . bye . 
Woke up with N*Sync stuck in my head , even though I have neither thought of that band nor heard their music in quite some time . Is this a symptom of being sick ? 
well , thus ends the Rangers ' season . If we didn't have all those injuries throughout the year , and had been a little more consistent , I think we could have gone further ..... damn it ... 
tea and homework . Hopefully working on a drawing later . 
After being so sick this weekend , I should have known that riding the bus today was a bad idea . I feel horrid now . I'm going to go lie down . 
is typing with one hand because < PROPMALE > is stealing my other arm .... 
WHY IS IT 80 DEGREES HERE IHBFOJNSCIDGVONCINNONONONONONO BQWTDFQIWCQOENIQOEVB STOP ... IT .... STOP BEING GROSS IT NOT BE SUMMER YET GO AWAY TOO HOT STOP NO AAHHHH DYING 
< PROPFIRST > gets back , telling me there are scary ominous dark clouds , wind picks up like crazy so we close all the windows . I look out the window and see the guy across the way close HIS window , then within 5 seconds RAIN STARTS POURING LIKE MAD OUTTA NO WHERE , ONE SECOND ZERO RAIN NEXT SECOND 23746987349 GALLONS OF RAIN !!!! LIGHTNING AND THUNDER AND SHIT !! TODAY IS INSANE 
it should not already be this hot when I wake up . This weather is a bunch of BS . 
Just wrote a dialogue for French class . It's supposed to be 5-7 minutes long , but when we wrote a < PROPFEMALE > to a < PROPFEMALE > and a half and read it , it was only 2.5 mins long . So we stopped anyway , cuz that's a LOT to memorize !!! 
Closing in , I hope that you make it . Closing in , I hope that you find your way . 
how ..... the HELL ..... is it already MAY ....?!?!?! 
hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihhihihihihihihi 
hihihihihiagainhihihihihihi . hihihih . hi . hihi . hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihhiihihiii 
how .... did I just end up on deviantART for over an hour looking at Snape fanart ?! @_@ .......... OH WELL !!!!!!!! 
Why ... do SO many people on devianART draw \red-haired\ " characters with BLOND HAIR ?? It's happening frequently enough that I'm starting to suspect there are actually a lot of people who think red hair and blond hair are synonymous . " 
I haven't been online much lately due to a lot of work since it's nearing finals week , but for the next two days I will not be on at all and probably won't respond to messages ; I have a drawing to finish , some prelim stuff for a final drawing , a LOT of writing to do for my mythology class , and a website to work on . So I'll see everyone NOT in the next few days , kaybai 
Do this , Don't do that , Can't you reeeaaad the siiiiiigns ? 
It's not what you've got , it's what you give . It ain't the life ya choose , it's the life you live . 
Just took some good reference photos , and now tonight consists of reading a book for class tomorrow , drawing stuff for finals week , and attempting to work on mythology homework . 
No more Mr Nice Guy , No more Mr Clee-ee-ee-ean , No more Mr Nice Guy , They say he's sick , He's obscee-ee-ee-eene ! * awesome guitar *
