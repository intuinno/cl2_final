5 minutes never seems to go by slower than when cooking Top Ramen .... 
9:20 AM tomorrow morning ... I will be meeting my maker . Anxiety attack central over here . I'm glad I'm not a baby or else this would be really bad ..... oh wait . Bye bye Wisdom Teeth , Hello ice cream . Haha sheesh ! 
All of my Days , Bowl of Oranges , and Pirate Disco , calm me down . Is that weird to have a wisdom teeth removal mix .... maybe I'll throw Red Sky in there just because it's pretty . Here I go ..... dun dun dun ...... :] Wish me luck ! 
Wouldn't mind a couple good friends who'd take a road trip to Disneyland this Summer . 
“You’ve only got three choices in life — give up , give in , or give it all you’ve got . ” 
Today would be the perfect day to go on an adventure and explore , but my wisdom teeth called and cancelled on me last minute .... do you think this means they want to break up with me ? Enjoy the sunshine for me ! 
Remember that scene from < PROPFEMALE > where she is 5 and makes perfect pancakes and all that fun music is playing ? .... Well this is nothing like that . Where is that little telekinetic genius when you need her ?! .... Makin ' pancakes . :] Yummy to my tummy . 
The lengths to which I go to avoid answering the door when random people come to my house to sell or talk to me about something is really ridiculous . 
That feeling you get after watching someone do what they really love . :] 
Makin ' instruments out of pots , pans , text books , all things brass , sticks , suitcases , bottles , and everything else I can find . This is creativity at it's absolute finest ( and by finest I mean lowest ;]) . The weather has put me in the best of best moods . I love the weekend . :D ! 
Thank god for Csap week . :] 
One of those days where you look outside and can't imagine the world being anymore beautiful . Thank you sunshine , let's < PROPFEMALE > out more often .

< PROPFIRST > Amidon's new album is on my mind , along with the fact that this weather is booming . Life feels nice today . I love you guys , all of you . 
Dear Hot Tub Time Machine , thank you for reminding me of my weird obsession with < PROPFIRST > Cusack . 
Let’s put all religious disagreements aside and just eat some < PROPFEMALE > . 
< PROPMALE>'s World and McDonald's ..... isn't this how everyone celebrates Easter ?...... oh . 
When did I get so good at taking naps ? Dang ! I think I have a new game for the Summer Olympics .... extreme napping , or hopscotch .... haven't decided which one is more logical . 
Speaking fluent nonsense . 
Why is it coffee always tastes better on Sundays ? 
Have a great day ..... unless you're name is < PROPFIRST > Beck , in that case , don't . ;] 
I only care about singing songs . School , get out of my face . 
1:52 AM .... clearly the best time to start watching Good Burger ...... if only I owned it . 
Let's just have fun and eat pb&j's! The two key things to a good life . 
Mr. Conan O'Brien , quit growing that beard you're making me fall more and more in love with you . :]

When things get weird ..... get weirder . 
It's impossible to sleep with such good music in my ears . 
I will stand by the fact that Ke$ha is nothing but an Uffie tribute band .... 
Today is the day for an adventure . 
Get a life or read a book and steal someone else's . :] 
Watching Cash Cab with < PROPFEMALE > instead of studying .... you can see where our priorites lie . 
Smile more often . 
Sleep is for squares and people with caring biological clocks . 
BRB , still looking for that chick < PROPFIRST > SanDiego . ;] 
It's 1:30 in the morning and I'm getting my Neon Indian on . That's easy livin ' right there . 
Tonight I will be feet from < PROPFEMALE > Matsson and < PROPMALE > Rateliff . Why study for my World Religions final when such life changing music is around me ? 
Later high school , hello Summer .

Making fun percussion instruments out of random objects is f-u-n . 
Happy Daddy Day ! Nothing like 50% of your DNA . 
My poor Mandela :[ 
Today was a good day in Soccer . Both the teams , I'm so proud .

Meet me in Montauk . 
Go to Google type in 2204355 and press ' I'm Feeling Lucky ' . Your life will be forever changed . For the better ? Maybe , I'll let you decide . 
Goodnight , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I like going on drives and the smell of new vanilla candles .... these things have no correlation . Anyway , I'm going on a drive ... :] 
Coffee and early morning drives when you can't fall back to sleep . 
It's too beautiful to not be out and about today ! 
I might have just spent just under $400 dollars on a lap harp ... MIGHT .... oh god , I am so excited . 
I'm just mainly interested in going/climbing somewhere to see a pretty view right now . 
The roads seem so beautifully quiet at 2:30 am . 
I could live in a Barnes and < PROPMALE > . 
A night hike would be so gorgeous right now , anyone have a sweet lantern or maybe , like , 5,000 sparklers ? 
Nervous tummy hours before airplane rides . 
God , I love airports . Home today :D ! 
There is nothing like being reminded of my lovely time in San < PROPMALE > by a gnarly shoulder sun burn . Thanks , California , home feels extra cozy now . ;D 
Just went on a three hour drive , no biggie . The music was too good to stop . :D ! 
\Hey 
Because life is fun , that's why . 
I really enjoy eating skittles with my eyes closed and trying to guess the flavor . 
Yes , I too , am going to < PROPFEMALE > Castles tonight . The epic-ness this is going to entail is making my tummy nervous 7 hours beforehand . 
My ears are still ringing from < PROPFEMALE > Castles . 
Just buyin ' 8th row tickets to Sufjan Stevens .... no big deal ...... oh .... my .... god . 
Don't fret , the beat goes on .

Bon Iver on Kanye West tracks ?! Hm .. hm ... I can dig . 
Diani Riopelle thinks she the hottest thing alive . 
Best time for song writing . 
Happiness looks good on you . 
Because it ain't gotta be pretty in order to be beautiful . 
Sufjan Stevens , all day . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > is always blowing my mind . 
Bike paths with Dr. Dog . 
AKA impressive pb&j sandwich maker < PROPFEMALE > . 
Wide eyed , wide awake . This proves to be a problem when it's 2am . 
I always get sucked into watching those weird VH1 countdown shows . Please VH1 , tell me , who are the 100 greatest artists of all time ? 
HOLLAlujah ! 
Playing xylo like there is no tomorrow .... for tomorrow . ;D 
It's a beautiful day to be anything you want . 
I cannot wait for those orange leaves and the snow that starts falling shortly after . 
\If she were president she'd be Babe-raham Lincoln . \ " ZING ! " 
80's power ballads 4lyfe .... I mean , what ?! 
Late night bike rides are too lovely . 
Because I'd rather have flowers in my hair , that's why . 
Uh , 4 8 15 16 23 42 . 
Ah yes , thank you Thom Yorke for just , ya know , being you . 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , let's do this right . 
When the going gets weird , get weirder . 
Life is interesting -- play Scrabble ... just because , that's why . 
I'd rather spend my days on mountains , in libraries , or museums . 
Finding matching socks is a blessing . 
Pizza < PROPMALE > 2k10 . 
The movie ' The Little Vampire ' is so underrated . 
Every girl needs her own Die Antwoord tee . 
Got stopped by a \lady cop\ " on my way home .... it was a lot less sexy than that Lil ' < PROPMALE > song ..... " 
Death by Dubstep ... 
Smiling is the new hip thing ..... don't you want 2 be kewl ? 
Now for a night drive , Knight Rider . 
Got that cloudy-cold weather-watching too many creepy things on the tube-drinking hot chocolate/tea-thing going on . Ya know .... life is kinda beautiful that way . 
Tubular , Tubueller , Ferris Bueller . 
Eating Hot Cheetos until my tongue sets fire to itself .... or at least feels like it has . 
Went on a drive , took a wrong turn , got lost , and ended up in one of the most beautiful places I've been in a long time . I don't think I could have been happier with today . 
Autumn is the best season for singing songs outside and getting randomly stopped by the nicest cop you've ever met ... Tim Beals , you're the man . 
C'mon Zombie Crawl , come faster ! 
Slightly ridiculous with a giant side of awesome , let's get to it ! Hope everyone is having the greatest weekend and smiling ! 
It is ridiculous how much more often I flip people off out of love than out of spite . 
Watching Bottle Rocket in my English Composition class ?.... I guess I can kind of dig this whole college thing .... 
I'm trying to get everyone I know to go to Zombie Crawl . Therefore , as a wise person once said : \be there or be square . \"" 
Perfect day to watch scary things . 
Because ending the night during the morning is what all the cool kids are doing . 
Later , Muggles . 
Sleep doesn't seem to be my friend anymore . 
Remember , remember the fifth of November . 
I feel like singing today . Today is a good day to be anything at all . 
This whole getting dark at 5 thing is already slightly depressing .... 
Conan O'baby is back . 
It's just passed midnight .... so obviously I'm watching Madeline ... what else ?! 
Just smile because you're here to see today . 
I miss you , Zoog Disney . 
If you've smiled less than 900 times today ....... watch < PROPFEMALE > . 
Warm and fuzzy Fall Break feelings . 
Fall fog , I love you . 
Give thanks everyday . However , today be thankful for the next six weeks of leftovers . Yum . 
Winter time is my main excuse to stock up on hats and boots . 
I-hop , U-hop , We-hop . 
Nothing quite like a nice , cohesive album on a cold and cloudy day . 
Hello December , we meet again . I'll bring the hot chocolate if you bring the snowfall . 
Today is a good day , because I said so , that's why ! ;] 
\Did The Rainbow Fish teach you nothing as a child ?! \"" 
See ya later , Political Science class ! It's been real , but chances are , I won't remember a single thing about you in 5 weeks . 
Stop , drop , < PROPMALE>'s World 2 is on . 
This weekend calls for a little beautiful spontaneity . 
Mostly , I just miss < PROPFIRST > Farley . 
I like to strategically stop between cars at stoplights so people will not see me singing ... 
Please snow , please snow , please snow , please snow . 
Listening to < PROPMALE > and Garfunkel while driving is like a dream . 
Whoaaaaa , there's gonna be an Eclipse .... this oddly reminds me a lot of the ' < PROPFEMALE>'s Comet ' episode of Hey < PROPMALE > , life imitates art ... ya know . 
Life is too short ..... ya , I know , but it really is that simple . Go out on an adventure today . 
I am more than ready for the < PROPFEMALE > Colorado days to last longer . Hello Winter Solstice , whateva whateva , let's get the sunshine back ! 
Singing songs never sounds better than during the holidays . 
I kinda , sorta , really love wapping presents . 
To go along with all the other Christmas statuses : hey you , all of you , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas . I hope you spend it with the lovliest people and smile until your cheeks hurt . And for all of you who don't celebrate Christmas , kick back and relax ... this is your day too . Be happy , you're all wonderful . 
A drive to mountains just to see the snow and count the millions of stars is never out of the question . I want to get lost in Pine trees just for a little while . 
Letting 5 year olds give you marker tattoos is all fun and games until you have 15 of them .... and they're all hearts . 
\And then the snow came and every thing felt just a little bit better -- a little more beautiful . \"" 
Why am I on Facebook when there is clearly mountains of snow that needs to be played in ?! 
Break out the kazoos , kids , let's send 2010 off right . 
I'd like to start and end every day with Radiohead . 
I'm thinking about investing in a snowmobile so I'm able to get around in this weather , or better yet , an army tank .... 
Sometimes you have just got to go with it , because why not ? 
Being weird is cool .... it's that simple . 
When in doubt the answer is pizza . 
Happy birthday , Mom ! You know you're my number one lady . :] 
I have been going outside to dust off my car in 10 minute intervals .... for the passed 45 minutes .... 
It's 1:09 am so NOT watching The Goonies is practically a crime ... 
Kings of < PROPFIRST > and feeding the homeless , in that order exactly . Today I'm feelin ' pretty lucky . 
Playing guitar makes my fingers miss the piano or at least some nice nylon strings . 
Little fingers , little guitar , little strings , little lady . I love playing music . 
Oh , maybe I should post something about Radiohead ..... hm , something about Radiohead ! P.S : Thom Yorke . 
I'm real weird .... 
Cd player in my car isn't working so I spent 45 minutes driving around serenading myself with Flight of The Conchord covers . 
Coke slurpees sound good at any given moment .... and that's just a fact . 
Roses are red , violets are blue , I am schizophrenic , and so am I . 
It feels nice when it's 7 at night and still bright out . 
Not much compares to a train ride with a Red Bull . 
Typing papers on books you never read ... oh . 
This is a status update , for all of you , so you know that I literally have nothing exciting enough to post in a status update . 
At the airport on my way to Seattle ... probably going to return to Colorado at least 3 times cooler than when I left because ... c'mon , it's Seattle .... 
I'm really just so , so lucky . I think it's important to acknowledge that every once in a while . 
If you're not eating cereal at 12 in the morning , well then you're doing it wrong .... 
Just feels like a great morning to be alive . 
Class canceled therefore , I make a feast of breakfast foods ... obviously . 
There are millions of people in the world . None of those people is an extra . They’re all the leads of their own stories . 
Get your booties outside ! It's beautiful out ! 
< PROPFEMALE > always sounds good around midnight . 
Do what makes you feel good . 
< PROPFIRST > Lathrop Wineinger is really good at making high class , gormet frozen pizza ... ya know ... 
< PROPMALE > Smith is the Doctor . 
I haven't seen this many status updates since The Black Eyed Peas blew it at the Superbowl .... 
Happy birthday , Daddy , I love you more than all the < PROPFEMALE > s . 45 years old and still a rock < PROPFEMALE > .
