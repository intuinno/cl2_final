Words empower people and allow us to do things such as inspire , promise , and teach . It is time to start thinking about the language we use in our everyday life and build people up rather than tear them down . Whenever you say the word “retarded” you are hurting someone . Stop the misuse of the R-Word ! Post this message to your status for however long you see fit to help raise awareness about the R-Word . 
so uhhhhm . evhs people (: whens your last day of schoooool ! \
