God didnt create hell for you and me but for Satan and his followers !! 
“It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return , but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel . ” 
Hope is the most exciting thing in life and if you honestly believe that love is out there , it will come . And even if it doesn't come straight away there is still that < PROPMALE > all through your life that it will . ” 
\May the love hidden deep inside your heart find the love waiting in your dreams . May the laughter that you find in your tomorrow wipe away the pain you find in your yesterdays . ” " 
“Even though we've changed and we're all finding our own place in the world , we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face , we'll come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us , nothing will ever change so much to the point where we're not all still friends . ” 
When things are bad , we take comfort in the thought that they could always be worse . And when they are , we find hope in the thought that things are so bad they have to get better . ”

“It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance . It is the dream afraid of waking that never takes the < PROPMALE > . It is the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give . And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live . ” 
“Anyone can give up , it's the easiest thing in the world to do . But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart , that's true strength . ” 
We got snow and i am so happy i woke up this morning and there was snow on the ground !!!! 
“The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for . And the most you can do is live inside that hope . ” 
“Lord , make me an instrument of your peace ; where there is hatred , let me sow love ; where there is injury , pardon ; where there is doubt , faith ; where there is despair , hope ; where there is darkness , light ; and where there is sadness , joy . ”
