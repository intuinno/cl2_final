I am damaged at best like you've already figured out . I'm falling apart , I'm barely breathing . With a broken heart , that's still beating . In the pain there is healing . In your name I find meaning . So I'm holding on , I'm barely holding on to you .

Despite the incredible sophistication of modern observatories , computers and satellites , astronomy has remained the most democratic science . Everyone can appreciate the wonder of a starlit night , the beauty of the < PROPFEMALE>'s cratered landscape or Saturn's distant rings .

the perfect summer night . <3 
Our planet is a < PROPFEMALE > world orbiting an average < PROPFEMALE > , on the outskirts of a middling galaxy in a small galaxy cluster , itself in thrall to an enormous supercluster that is merely a speck in the true scale of the Universe . And yet on this insignificant world , a miracle has happened - life has evolved , with enough intelligence to < PROPFEMALE > e across the cosmos and dimly comprehend it's true extent .
