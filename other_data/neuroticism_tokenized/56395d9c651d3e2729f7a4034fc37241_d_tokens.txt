Despite the incredible sophistication of modern observatories , computers and satellites , astronomy has remained the most democratic science . Everyone can appreciate the wonder of a starlit night , the beauty of the < PROPFEMALE>'s cratered landscape or Saturn's distant rings .

the perfect summer night . <3 
Our planet is a < PROPFEMALE > world orbiting an average < PROPFEMALE > , on the outskirts of a middling galaxy in a small galaxy cluster , itself in thrall to an enormous supercluster that is merely a speck in the true scale of the Universe .
