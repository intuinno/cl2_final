Tired Tuesday , and here I thought Monday was going to be bad ! Adding school to my kids/workload is going to take some adjusting . Time to put on the game face .. grrr ! ( YAWN) !!! 
is ready to hook up a coffee I.V at this point ! Another long day ahead may as well get to it . 
is determined to get through the rest of this week . Feel like a zombie from lack of sleep but puttin one foot in front of the other !

Busy day .. appts early then homework to catch up on . Go Blue !!! 
Finally got a full nights sleep ! Ready to spend time with family , going to < PROPFEMALE>'s party and then doing some homework . 
Ugh .. Monday , the weekends don't last long enough ! Had a great time at the PartyLite Candle Party last night though . Thanks Bff !! 
Rain , rain go away !! Pizza and movies with the boys instead of homecoming . With everyone being sick not takin a < PROPMALE > of spending the evening in the rain . 
Tryin to plan a family day to enjoy this fall weather .. Pumpkin Fest downtown and Huckleberry but the attitudes are aleady flying this morning and the boys are going to be missing out if things dont change ! KIDS !! 
Happy 13th Birthday < PROPMALE > !!!! I Love YOU !!!! 
Busy busy busy .. lots to do today . Need a big cup of motivation becuase the coffee isnt helping !! 
Managed to get a few things accomplished yesterday but didnt plan on that trip to the urgent care clinic . < PROPMALE > injured his wrist in gym class , 3-xrays and 4 hrs later its sprained & not broke this time . Boys will be boys , what can ya do ?? 
Thankful it's Friday but I still have a busy day ahead . 
Kicking back with the family tonight . Gonna enjoy some pizza and scary movies . 
Lots of homework this weekend .. exam to study for on Mon and quiz for Tues but I am determined to get it done and still enjoy the rest of the weekend with my boys !!

Happy its Friday so I can spend some time with my boys this weekend . Bring on the fun !! 
What a weekend , had a great time ! Visit to the apple orchard , a spooky hayride , 3 haunted houses and a belated bday party at Rollhaven . Thank you to everyone who was able to enjoy it with us ! Uncle < PROPMALE > got into town just in time ! Oh and < PROPFIRST > STILL sleeps with his light on , lol . 
thinks people should follow their own advice ! Concern themselves with their own problems and quit worrying about other's relationships ! 
Does friendship not mean anything to anyone anymore ? Tired of being hurt and stabbed in the back by my supposed close \true friends \"- SO OVER IT and i'm not doing it anymore ! " 
Woke up to a sore throat and the boys trying to kill each other . Happy Halloween ! 
Off the grandmother's house we go ! Have a great night everyone .. Happy Halloween !! 
Had a fun night at mom's with friends and family ! Hoping to save the pics , seem to be having technical difficulties with the camera . Of all nights for it to get some sort of error .. grrr ! ( fingers crossed ) But for now time to relax and get back to reading Breaking < PROPFEMALE > . 
is enjoying a relaxing Sunday morning . Love spending Sundays chillin with my family :) 
Tired , tired , tired .. going back to bed after the boys get out the door ! Think i'm coming down sick .. ugh ! 
Feeling better today then I have all week . May just be winning the battle over this virus yet . At least I didnt wake up with a sore throat today so i'm hoping that is a good sign ! 
I knew I was a little to hppeful yesterday .. started running a temp last night . Feelin a lil bit better this morning , guess we'll see how the day goes . Looks like < PROPFIRST > is coming down with it next- just great ! 
Sick , sick , sick .. temp keeps spiking up , < PROPMALE > body aches , chills to sweats . Cant do anything but lay around drinking the fluids and pumping the meds .. i am miserable ! < PROPFIRST > has a cough but I dont think he is as bad off as I am , thankfully . Hope he doesnt get to this point ! 
FINALLY feeling better and I am able to function among the land of the living again . Thanks to everyone who wished me well ! 
Feeling good and ready to start my day ! 
Busy day today , a bunch of errands to run & parent teacher conferences- OH Boy ! 
The boys spent the night at Gammy's house & I miss them already ! 
Went and seen New < PROPFEMALE > yesterday-Awesome ! Then took the boys to the General's game , they lost but the boys had lots of fun ! Hoping today is going to be just as fun for them ! 
Happy Thanksgiving ! Hope everyone has a wonderful day enjoying the big turkey dinner !! 
Had a great Thanksgiving spending time with my family and great food .. thanks Mom !! It was also nice to have my brother home for the holiday , enjoyed seeing him too !! Now we have a couple of my nephews spending the night and the boys are having a great time ! Thankful for my family :) 
Going to be getting the Christmas cards out before the end of this week .. need addresses . Please send them to my inbox .. thanx !!

Another year older as of yesterday and of course I have been sick with the flu since the start of the week . Thankfully my boys had a snow day and helped in any way they could . Underneath their tough exterior the lessons of love and compassion I have taught them are sticking in there some where . They may be a handful now but someday they will grow up to be great men ! That is the best bday present I could have received ! 
Kudos to you Mom !! I'm really happy something good has finally come your way !! Love You !! 
Ok , so when an Aflac rep calls and says we would like you to come in for an interview but it is not for a sales position .. DO NOT believe a word of it ! I just wasted an hour of my time to find out Aflac is hiring for sales reps .. UGH !! What a waste , you think they will pay me for that hour of my time ?? Especially when I specifically told them on the phone I am not interested in a sales position ! 
If you have a Best Friend that will drop anything for you , be there for you , through thick and thin . And still loves you when you mess up and still loves you for all your faults copy and paste this to your status !!!...? 
Day off , < PROPFEMALE > and 60 ! To bad I have lots of errands to run .. hopefully I get a < PROPMALE > to enjoy at least some of this nice mild weather ! 
Was having a pretty good day till I got home and my laptop was broken . So now I must ask for < PROPFEMALE > to deal with my children and courage to tolerate their attitudes because Lord only knows if I ask for strength I will beat them to death ! 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day to Everyone !! :) 
Had a terrible day off !! Woke up in some < PROPMALE > pain !! Spent all morning at my Dr's office to find out I have sprained my right shoulder . He wants me off work for the next 2 wks , dont see how that's going to happen ? Had to go get xray and that took most of the afternoon . Heavily medicated yet still in pain and suppose to work a 24 hr shift starting tomorrow afternoon . This happened at the worst possible time ! 
Ok so I thought I was going to be off work today .. goin in tonight . Oh well , it's money right ? 
Instead of sitting here searching through status shuffle to find one to explain how sleepy I am , I think it might be smart just to get off of FB and GO TO BED !!! 
Not feelin well this evening ... Night All 
Sick again .. yeah me :( 
Just jumped on here for a min .. havent done any apps today with being sick and all-bare with me , I will get to them tomorrow sometime ( hopefully ) . Slept all day so i'm feelin a lil better , got alot to do tomorrow . I'm going back to bed .. Night All . 
So i'm up to start gettin ready for morning Dr appts ... I just want to crawl back into bed !! UGH ! 
Yep still sick .. been sick since Monday . Me temp keeps spiking up to 102 when the meds wear off . Got another Dr appt today then another one again on Fri . Wondering if this will ever end ????? 
Went to the Dr today and found out I have a severe bladder infection . Dr has me on an antibiotic called Bactrim , Motrin 800 for the fever & off work the rest of the week . I keep going from chills/high temp to sweating my butt off . All I can do is sleep , keep drinking fluids and taking my meds . I am so miserable and very lethargic , I just hope i'm better in time for Easter !! 
And yet another Dr appt today .. happy happy joy joy :{ 
is FINALLY starting to feel more like myself again ! Jeez , I was starting to wonder if I was going to be lost in la la land forever ... 
Happy Easter .. hope everyone has a great day !! :)

I am saddened by the fact I will not get to see your smiling face but I am at peace knowing you are no longer suffering in pain . May God welcome you home with open arms .. you will be deeply missed but I will never forget the time we shared in this life . I Love You !

Well The Rangers took an 11-4 loss last night from Davison . Davison is a very advanced team w/ alot of trick plays . BUT < PROPMALE > got his 1st RBI , he was down 2 strikes & the 3rd one he whacked into the outfield right in btw their outfielders ! He made it to 1st & got the guy on 3rd across homeplate .

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , live far away , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Repost if you have at least one true friend . 
I'm not supersuperstitious , but this year July has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So Copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy ,... will be without money . I can't let that person be ME ! What the ... heck- it cant hurt 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the UNITED STATES OF < PROPFEMALE > , and to the REPUBLIC for which it stands , one nation under GOD , indivisible , with < PROPFEMALE > and JUSTICE for all !! I grew up reciting this every morning in school . We no longer do that for fear of OFFENDING SOMEONE !! Let's see how many < PROPFEMALE > NS will re-post this & not care about offending someone ! GOD BLESS < PROPFEMALE > 
If you can't handle me at my worst , then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best . \ \ 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Re-post if you agree 
Asking if everyone could please put this as your Facebook status for 1hr : For those who have ( or have had ) cancer , we pray that a cure will be found in 2011 ? 
YOUR SON WILL HOLD YOUR HAND FOR ONLY ALITTLE WHILE , BUT WILL HOLD YOUR HEART FOR A LIFETIME . ITS SON'S WEEK .. IF YOU HAVE A SON , WHO MAKES YOUR LIFE WORTH LIVING BY JUST BEING AROUND , AND YOUR PROUD OF YOUR SON , Copy and paste to your status .... 
Three hrs at the Dr , 1 hr getting a stat ultrasound on my leg that has been swollen & numb for over 2 wks now AND still NO ANSWERS ... Grrrr !!! Go back to Dr next Fri for all the good it does . AND Oh yeah and my hair is still falling out giving me bald spots from stress but do you think my Dr gave me anything for it ?? NOPE ... what's the point in waiting to see him ????? 
Do you ever look at some people and just think damn , why didn't their momma just swallow ? 
Grrrr ... why does life have to be so complicated ?? ( sigh ) 
It takes so much energy to < PROPFEMALE > around hatred and then it eats at you . Let it go . Forgiveness doesn't always mean accepting that person back into your life as they were , sometimes it simply means that you acknowledge that we are all human and therefore make mistakes . Let it go , and if necessary , let them go ; find peace in the resolution that they no longer hold a place in your life . 
A boy writes a letter to\ 
God . \Dear God 
Dear God , \ 
My prayer for 2011 is for a fat bank account & a thin body . Please don't mix these up like last year . \ 
Amen 
Don't lose hope . When you are down to nothing , God is up to something . Keep your faith strong ! ? 
Goin out to dinner to celebrate my < PROPFEMALE>'s B-Day ! Yay , finally a couple hrs of it being just the two of us !! ( Much needed & well deserved ) :) 
Went out & had a nice dinner without the kids for a change .. was actually a lil relaxing . Now my leg is just throbbing ! Another Dr appt Fri then more testing next week . Wish they would just find the prob & fix it .. UGH ! 
This week we remember babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all lost angels 
Words are full of Power !!! They can heal , they can wound , encourage , discourage . People get divorces over words , families are split , build insecurity and poor self image over words that have been spoken to them . We need to choose our words very carefully . All we have in this life is our words ! Communication is key . Watch what you say . Be careful with what comes out of our mouth . 
Remember , life is balance . You'll never know how great it can be , unless you know how bad it can get . 
... LOVE me for me , not for who you WANT me to be , cuz in the end ... I'm still just ME ! 
-- Welcome to my wall .. Today's specials are : Lack of sleep , up too early , and low on patience .. thank you , come again -- 
Look out mid Michigan , the BIG ONE is suppose to be coming tomorrow afternoon/evening is the start of 10 to 12 inches of SNOW .... UGH !!! 
Hello FB Family & Friends ! Been out of the loop for a few days .. just laying around with my leg propped in < PROPMALE > pain , yay me . :( Anyway had ct scan yesterday , they seem to think its something neurological with my back causing the problems . Going back to my pain mgmt Dr next week .. man , I hope she can at least ease some of this pain ! Hope all is well with everyone else !! 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . these types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . they understand that life is busy .. but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are ! 
Ok .. I have to say that half time show was awesome !! I think it may be the best one I have seen yet ... that was totally \beast\ " ( as < PROPFIRST > says ) !! Now ready for the 2nd half .... " 
WTG Green Bay !

? If you miss someone that's in heaven , put this as your status !? \ 
??????????????? ????? ??????????????? 
A normal person has 1,000 wishes . A < PROPFEMALE > only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died , a wounded warrior or who is fighting for your freedom , please repost in their honor . ***** As always , brother you are in our thoughts and prayers ! We love you --- Please be safe !! ***** 
Thank-You soooo much for all the Birthday Wishes Everyone !! Lots of luv to you all for thinking of me ! :) 
Yesterday was probably 1 of the worst B-days ever . To start with we all woke up late , drovethe boys to school an hr late . Then had to make my appt . w/my pain mgmt Dr. Only to find out my ct scan revealed a slipped disc in the lower lumbar region of my back . Then I had to get an epidural steroid injection with two ENORMOUS needles ! That is how the day started & just got worse from there . Hope today goes way better !! 
The boys are doing the Webelo Scouts camping this weekend . Pinewood Derby was this morning , Eric came in 4th & was bummed he didnt place for a trophy But < PROPMALE > entered the family race & took 2nd with the other car . They were both happy with the 2nd place trophy ! Then they got to spend the afternoon sledding , ice fishing & who knows what else ? 1 more peaceful night kid free while they are doing activities they enjoy ! :) 
The boys made it home from their camping weekend in good spirits . Learned a few new things & < PROPFIRST > earned quite a few new badges-he is very proud of that fact ! It was nice to have the quiet time but I love having them back home !! I dont know what to do without them .. i'm thinkin a good ole fashion Family Sunday Dinner for a nice ending to the weekend . :) 
My mom has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed , saw me fall , cheered me on , kept me going strong , and drove me a little crazy at times . But moms are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever ! Put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful mom whom you love . ? I love you Mom !!!!!!!!!! 
Wishing to get out of this rut .. bring on summer !! 
So .. Jacob got into another fight this afternoon . According to all the kids around he \won\ " this one . I guess it's just in the Kimbrell blood ( sigh ) ... can't wait for these boys to grow out of this ! < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > eventually did so I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel but it doesnt seem to be getting here quick enough ! " 
< PROPMALE > had his solo ensemble tonight , he did okay on his solo piece , earned the silver medal for that performance . BUT the quartet could have went better , they still brought home the bronze medal tho . Practice or lack there of was the key-what kid dont like to beat on a percussion < PROPFEMALE > ? 4yrs in band and 3yrs on percussion , he is good but he could be so much better if he would just practice more .. Grrr ! 
Ok so i'm not wanting to complain ( well maybe a lil ) .. what the heck happened to all my friends ?? No one calls , txts , emails , even a snail mail letter would excite me right about now , lol . I know I have been sick most of the winter , maybe not very socialable but I miss my close friends & Besties !! ( You know who you are ) I'm feelin soooo unloved :( 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status Pray for our Troops !! 
Hey ! Unkind persons ! Your behavior is not very nice ! Picketing fallen soldiers ' funerals .... Yeah , I'm talking to you ! Do you know WHY you are allowed to do that ? BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE DISRESPECTING GAVE HIS OR HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY ! I reposted this because I wasn't afraid to express my undying gratitude to every single service person past , present and future . 
Made mistakes , sometimes more than I like to admit , being a Mom . But I will always be there for you , to hear you , to cheer you , to laugh or cry with you , to protect you with my life , to sometimes tell you things you don't want to hear and to love you for eternity with all my heart . No one will ever love you more than I do , I'm your Mom ! Repost if you have children , young or adult , that will always be in your heart ! 
We took < PROPFIRST > to see Rango last night for getting A's & B's on his report card .. as well as good behavior for the marking period . It was a cute movie and he had a great time ! Good Job , son & i'm sooo glad you enjoyed the movie ! :) 
So we attended < PROPFIRST>'s parent teacher conference & she had nothing put praise for him ! It was actually a student led conference with a Powerpoint he put together -- very impressive !! I have dabbled here & there w/ Powerpoint but my 5th grader seems to have it mastered .. WOW , blows my mind the things our kids are being taught these days !! Amazing .... 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So He put his arms around you and He whispered come to me . With tearful eyes I watched you , and saw you pass away . Although I loved you dearly , I couldn't make you stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest . God broke my heart to prove to me , He only takes the best . Put this on your status if there is someone in heaven you miss every day . 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . If you're against bullying you may want to post this . 
Need to get motivated & get ready for work ... ( yawn ) ... Hope everyone has a great day !! 
Tired , tired , tired ... tryin to get the boy's in bed but they keep trying to delay the inevitable . Think they are hopin for a snow day tomorrow but they ARE going to bed whether they have school or not ! Ready for some peace & quiet ... 
Snow Day for the boys , i want a snow day too !! i know i just started this job but i am tired as hell . schedule is all over the place this week and i just want to go back to my warm cozy bed -- Oh well .. off to the shower i go , hopefully my shift goes by fast ! Have a good day all and be careful out there ! 
There comes a time in your life when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living .
