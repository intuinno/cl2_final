What the Republicans are doing is trying to repeal the healthcare plan , for which they do not have the 2/3 rds votes to overturn a Presidential veto to begin with , because once the law becomes affective come 2014 people will realize the strong benefits of the law first hand and at the same time will awaken to outright lies perpetrated by Fox News and the Republicans as well ! 
SNL would be so much funnier if that random retarded chick stopped barging in on every skit ... oh wait she works there ? Please leave everyone alone < PROPFEMALE > Wiig ... youre not funny ...
