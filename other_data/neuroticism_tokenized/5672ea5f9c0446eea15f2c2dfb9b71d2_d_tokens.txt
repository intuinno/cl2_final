Happy ONE YEAR Luke :) !!!!! 
I Guess it's Just the Way the Cookie Crumbles . 
The Taste of Fading Away , I'm Burning with Only Me to Blame . 
My pulse is grown by it , You water all these lines . The only things that are still mine . 
The fever called \living\ " that maddened my brain . " 
Let it Go , there's no way you can save it now . 
This can't be saved if you can't be found , you didn't even say goodbye . 
Is it already time to ruin Squidwards Day ? 
It's always been beating inside you , now it's time to show them what you're worth . 
Tonight was Wonderful . 
I'm so glad we met . <3 Luke . 
Thanks Guys :) I Appreciate the Love . 
I woke up from dreaming and put on my shoes , making my way past two in the morning , I was waiting for something to ease my dreams away . 
Had a wonderful time with < PROPMALE > tonight . 
I want these words to make things right , but it's wrongs that make the words come to life . 
Cash parade with < PROPMALE > , then mall , mcdonalds , and the bowling alley with < PROPMALE > , in review has been a wonderful day and night c : 
You give in with no protest , \ 
It's already slipped-\ 
You have no more truth to confess . \ 
It seems with one seeping lie , \ 
You fall to your own detest . 
Grandma showed me how to fill out my planner , so maybe i can use it now :) 
Splendors you never have dreamed all your days , will be yours . 
Make sure to wish < PROPMALE > Guntharp the best birthday ever everyone <3 
I stared , uncomprehending , into his eyes . He stared back without apology . I felt like i could see into them for < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > , yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could i see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken . 
The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation . \ 
I was changed , my insides altered almost past the point of recognition . It was a promise that could not be kept , broken , as soon as it was made . 
Too much to say . 
Wondering if anyone knows what happened to my boyfriend . 
Baby , cause you blow my heart up . 
When I'm feeling down , you make that face you do . There's no one in the world that could replace you . 
I mucked up . 
I can't believe she didn't win . 
:D Very Happy . 
Loves < PROPMALE > Guntharp . 
Shloopos ? 
Got my prom dress . 
I could have said it back to you . 
I Caught myself before i thought it was okay , Guess it was too good to be true . 
I may never sleep tonight , as long as you're still burning bright .
