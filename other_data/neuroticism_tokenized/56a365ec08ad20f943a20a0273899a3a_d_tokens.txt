September 3rd resolution : update this more often . Went to a barber shop for the first time ever today . Got a clip and shave . Shave sucked , could've done better myself for cheaper . Good cut though . I think the other guys felt weird me being there though - I was the only white person there . Guess I'm just used to it . Anyway , next time I'll just get the clip and leave the shave and goattee to myself . 

Just chillin today . Watched Old School , The Blues Brothers , and now listening to Korn while playing Fallout 3 - killer combo . 
Just got back from first time shooting . Had a blast & kicked ass . With a 38 semi I hit 4/10 ( all in target ) on my first round , 4/10 in target +2 on paper outside target for second round , then 19/25 in target +3 on paper outside target for 3rd round . 1st and 2nd rounds were right handed ( since I am right handed ) , but for half of the third round I went lefty and actually did a little better & felt more comfortable . 
Had a damn awesome night last night ! 
Its that time of year again .... my sister is yet another year older . Old bag .... I mean , happy birthday sis , you were always my favorite ! ;p 
Had a great time last night and so did < PROPFEMALE > . Thanks all who came/contributed , especially < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Alannah couldn't stop smiling at me for awhile while I was holding her earlier * sigh * . But then she got cranky . She was yawning a lot before so I think she just wanted a nap . Were we all formerly as sweet as she ? 
first time karaoke last night - had a blast ! hope everyone else did to 
feels like crap ... on a stick ... in the rain ... with a throat full of broken glass . Ugh ! Nasty cold snuck up and hit me all of a sudden this morning . Been in bed all day and headin back there again now :( 
Thank you all :) 
Happy New Year everyone ! Have fun ! But be safe and careful - I expect to see you all around for many more ! :) 
mmmm ... pizza . Can't figure out why I always want to call Little Caesar's Little Cici's though . 
Happy Easter everyone . May all the < PROPFEMALE > heads you bite be chocolate and all your hidden eggs revealed to you :) 
Just saw \The Gamers : Dorkness Rising\ " last night . This is a must see . I was laughing so hard during the bard army part that my abs hurt =D " 
just finished applying for the Peace Corps . Wish me luck ! 
hopes for more nights like the last few . 
grrrrr ....! You don't ring someone's doorbell at 6am in the morning . You text , call , or knock lightly . And you make sure you have the right address >.< 
Got my camera today , woot ! My first one ever so be prepared to see me snappin pics fairly often . 
Found some old gift cards in my wallet yesterday . Called about their balances today and got an almost free lunch at PF < PROPFIRST>'s , a book at Barnes and < PROPMALE>'s , and will get a movie off Movie Tavern tomorrow . \ 
\ 
PF < PROPFIRST>'s was very delicious . I thought I had been there before , but apparently not . \ 
\ 
At BN I got The Once and Future < PROPMALE > . Once we get a break from this rain I'll start reading it . 
Off to my second ESL class . Hopefully with 7 students this time instead of just one . 
Second class was much better . Had 6 of 8 show up and had a great time . I'm diggin teaching . 
I'll follow you and make a heaven out of hell , and I'll die by your hand which I love so well . -- < PROPFIRST > Shakespeare 
Woke up this morning craving Sprite . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > :P 
this weekend was amazing . \ 
One half of me is yours , the other half yours-\ 
Mine own , I would say ; but if mine , then yours , \ 
And so all yours ! -- < PROPFIRST > Shakespeare 
grrr ! Found a couple awesome job openings at UTMB in Galveston via WorkinTexas , but I can't find the jobs listed on UTMB site to apply for them . 
class tonight was great again . We went over days , months , seasons , weather , < PROPFIRST > and places , classroom item names , past/present/future tenses , basic anatomy , and an introduction to restaurants . They are keenly interested in restaurants and so I have them bringing menus to the next class and we will go more in depth . 
Gird your loins - stormsacomin 
so I've never been to < PROPFIRST > - what's good there for food and fun ? 
making a special dinner tonight . 
What an amazing night ! 
Even as leftovers it was delicious , and those who know me know how I feel about leftovers , especially chicken . 
“Meeting you was fate , becoming your friend was a choice , but falling in love with you I had no control over . ” 
Trying to post the recipes on the wall was messy . I'm cleaning it up now . You will pictures of the written recipes under my new food picture album shortly . 
Her smile is as a soft warm < PROPFIRST > of sunshine on a long shadowed heart beckoning it out to a world brighter and more beautiful than could have been dreamt . Blessed am I . 
Love is a gift ever to be given and never to be taken . Its full power is experienced in relation to the degree you give yourself unto it - surrender unto love and you surrender unto happiness . 
So my Ramsay dinner night calls for 3 things I never heard , nor have the stores I've gone to . Brits ! A little research showed that minced beef is actually called hamburger meat here , icing sugar is powdered sugar here , and heavy whipping cream may be substituted for double cream ( which doesn't exist here at all ) . Back to the store I go . And again later when I can buy the red wine I need . Hope it all pays off :) 
Interesting night last night .... 
Cooking my first Italian meal Sunday evening - stuffed mushrooms , chicken rollatini < PROPMALE > , and tiramisu . Anyone hungry ? 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and me makes 5 . I'm going to call that full - 4 people at the table and me in the kitchen . Final menu = stuffed mushrooms with a butter sauce , chicken rollatini < PROPMALE > with both cavatelli and broccoli rice ( no cheese for < PROPFIRST > ) , and Tiramisu with a strawberry drizzle ( and extra chocolate shavings for < PROPFEMALE > ) . 
So I effed up . I fail at drinking knowledge . I thought you could buy liquor until midnight and so did the grocery shopping first , but got to a liquor store at 9:27 to find out I was wrong and now I have no rum for the tiramisu . I'll make it for you another time < PROPFEMALE > :( 
Raspberry-lemon syllabub with almond biscotti has been perfected ! And oh man is it full of perfection ! I want to eat the whole batch myself right now :) Can't wait for everyone to try it tomorrow . 
7 hours yesterday planning and shopping , and now its time to start cooking . Got in a little over my head this time maybe , but we shall see . 
Syllabub , butter sauce , and rollatini all prepped and ready to go . < PROPMALE > , cavatelli , and mushrooms left to go . Hopefully I can get everything done in time that I can eat with everyone rather than in the kitchen finishing stuff . 
Had 1 no call/no show , and the recipes I didn't make myself ( < PROPMALE > and cavatelli ) weren't perfect , but the mushrooms , rollatini , syllabub , butter sauce , and company were . 
Ugh ... couldn't fall asleep to save my life , and then woke up extra early . So much on my mind ... 
Love to watch the sun on the grass and hear the birds whilst enjoying my 1st cigarette and coke of the day . Ah the simple pleasures in life :) 
I love my class . They always make me feel better :) 
Showtimes are wonky today so only going to see 2 , but the 2 I most wanted to see - Expendables and Schmucks . 
Dinner for Schmucks was amazing ! The Expendables was good - a pretty standard action flick . 
I feel like cooking , but I don't know what . 
Had a great night , but I'm exhausted . I have 5 books for you too - The Hobbit , The Lord of the Rings Trilogy , and Relentless ( the Koontz I told you about ) . 
More than halfway through Wicked - very good so far , wicked even ;) \ 
And just watched The Box - messed up . 
Woke up extra early this morning , got a clean shave , suit and tie on , went to church extra early to talk to < PROPFEMALE > about joining the choir again , and found out they don't actually start performing until September :( Was a good service though . Amazingly hot out for this early in the morning too . 
I've decided on teacher certification and am likely to pursue 4-8 generalist . ACT < PROPMALE > has a program from Sept 14 - Nov 13 which should have me set to start my probationary year in January . 
Why must it always storm when I'm about to head out to teach my ESL class ? 
Score ! Just found out first year teachers make 45k ! I thought it would be 25-30 . 
Back in choir at CTRCC this Thursday . 
Just got Avatar in my Netflix - time to see what all that fuss was about . 
After almost 29 years women still baffle the hell out of me . Haven't given up trying yet though . 
Having a bad day . Is it 5 o'clock somewhere yet ? 
Just in case anyone else didn't know ... a pack of cigarettes and a fifth of a bottle of whiskey are no good on an emtpy stomach . 
Wednesday's menu : stuffed mushrooms with butter sauce , spicy chicken < PROPMALE > with bowtie pasta , and kiwi syllabub . 
Everytime I log into MySpace I have at least 3 ads from \The Hottest Singles in Town Want YOU !! 1 !! 11\ " or some other such nonsense . Glad I don't have to deal with that here . " 
Woke up late today , but feeling good . Back up to 200 on the bench press ( thanks to my wrist brace ) , and digging this walking business . ESL class tonight ! 
Lot of birthdays coming up . I think I have all my gifting planned finally . 
Trying my hand at < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . Salted dark chocolate balls ( thanks South Park ! ) . Who wants to help me by tasting my salty balls ? =D 
1st round salty chocolate balls : failed . too much salt . 2nd round coming soon . 
Why is Barnes and Nobles so expensive ? I don't get it . Saving ~ $5.50 and a drive by ordering through Amazon instead . 
sleepy ... 
Took my change to the bank - $38.50 in rolled change , woot ! 
Wednesday's menu : stuffed mushrooms with butter sauce , spicy chicken < PROPMALE > with bowtie pasta , and kiwi syllabub . \ 
Change-up in attendees , but I like this menu a lot , and apparently the newbies approve too , so sticking to the plan . Hopefully I remember to get more pics this time than I did last time . 
I'm torn about my kiwi ' bub . It is a little better now that it got to sit for a while , but its still not excellent . I want to thrown it away and make something else , but I've already gone over my budget . 
off to bed - gnight/gmornin 
They Shot My Cooter 
had a fucking blast last night ! 
bout to go help a friend move some stuff 
I feel bad . I accidentally turned off my phone last night apparently and missed < PROPFEMALE>'s call to go help her move this morning . Sorry Cat :( 
still awake ........ 
So I've been trying to get a back-up key made for my car ... I've been to Home Depot , Lowe's , Wal-Mart , and 2 locksmiths - all of which told me to go the dealer so today I went to the dealer to get a key made . $20 and 70 minutes later I have 6 extra keys , 1 of which won't open the doors or start the ignition and the other 5 just open the doors . :( 
Woot ! I slept last night :) 
Day 3 of no Coke in the house .... not enjoying it . 
Why can't I skip the previews when I watch dvd movies on my computer ? Grrrr ... 
Who is Kat Mlcak ? 
2nd day in a row waking up at 6 with no alarm :) 
My left hand is not happy with me . Been slowly building up on the benchpress to protect it and today I did a set of 5 reps at 205 - super easy . Since it was so easy I did another set of 5 in the afternoon - super easy again . Went to do a third set in the evening and as soon as I lifted the bar my left hand wanted to collapse in on itself :( 
My new favorite word - shiggles ! 
So I was exhausted yesterday afternoon after yard work , and even moreso after choir ( was falling asleep part of the time ) and yet I stayed up all night . So much for my fixed sleep schedule ... >.< 
Had a blast at the beach ! Will be better prepared next time though ( pants , off , more suncreen ) , and more rested . Got home yesterday and mostly slept from ~ 3pm to ~ 5am this morning . 
just took my 1st real shower since before the trip and now I can't decide what hurts worse - my 2nd degree sunburnt feet or my arms and legs that had mosquito frag grenades exploded onto them . at least I'm clean and don't smell like ass anymore , lol 
Wish me luck - about to try and get dressed for my ESL class tonight :( 
Survived my class , but just barely . The itching is becoming unbearable ! Been a long time since I've itched so much that it hurt :( 
off to my 1st class for teacher certification 
This is fridiculous ! 5 1/2 days I've had these bites and they're still itching :( Creams , lotions , benadryll , etc haven't seemed to help either . I guess there are just too many . Anyway , much less than it was at least . 
God created company to give us lazy people a reason to clean 
Found the recipes I thought I lost ! :) 
love clean-sheet day 
really ? really ? all week they were fine , but do a little bit of moving and now my feet are all blistered up . least they don't hurt ( yet ) 
No itching ftw ! =D 
Yes !!! Finally get more House =D 
Who wants free dinner ?! My birthday dinner for my sister - 2 spots for dinner tonight at my house . I'm making stuffed mushrooms , chicken rollatini ( chicken breast + prosciutto + parmesan rolled up and coated with italian bread crumbs and < PROPFEMALE > oil ) , and tiramisu ( my 1st tir - hope it comes out good ) . Text me ( 713-401-8689 ) . 1st two get the seats . Might be three - waiting on word from one . 
new food pics added . more to come later as well 
woot ! I actually completed the tiramisu ! and I discovered cheese-sex - blend of parmesan and pecorino romano . this dinner is going to be scrumptious ! wish I had more mouths to feed 
Rest of pics added . \ 
Overall a very trying meal , but I made it through . 
Today is the last day of my 1st ESL class . Each class is 3 months . Hard to believe I've already been doing it that long . I've enjoyed it immensely and am re-upping the class . Tonight they take their end-of-class CASAS and then next week we start the new one . 
so tired .... why did I have to wake up at such an ungodly hour ? 
I don't like the taste of re-heated chicken , but the prosciutto and cheese is so good . I'm torn 
yeah , I think I definitely don't like Tarantino movies 
woke up early Sunday , and now I can't stop waking up early . my sleep schedule is way too malleable , lol 
going to try my hand at homemade chicken noodle soup today . wish me luck ! 
someone tell the mosquitos its time for them to leave :( 
movie night with Alli , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > ftw ! especially with Alli and < PROPFEMALE>'s Mystery Science-esque commentary , lol\ 
definitely should do that again soon 
Baklava = epic win ! 
Baklava ftmfw ! need to learn how to make this stuff , but .... if I do I might never be able to see my feet again , lol 
Fry & < PROPFEMALE > ftw ! lol 
so it would seem that I finally caught the cold everyone has been passing around , yuck :( 
bout to watch The Illusionist , trying to not think about being sick . this movie has some pretty amazing reviews , so hope its good 
I want me to make some more of my chicken noodle soup , but I don't want to :( 
Why am I immune to cold meds ? Tylenol cold and sinus ? no effect . Claritin ? no effect . Day-quil ? no effect . grrrr 
I love that I recover so fast :) Almost completely done being sick , but now I'm restless 
It Might Get Loud . 
< PROPFEMALE > Barnes = win ! 
much to do - haircut , bank , grocery shop , clean my car , do laundry , clean house . very excited though - can't wait for Monday ! 
wow ... you're doing it right when you go to taste it and next thing you know you realize you're licking and digging your fingers in like you grew up in a jungle 
got < PROPFEMALE>'s and my cars cleaned up pretty spiffily . Mine almost looks as good as when I first detailed it when I got it . Just need to do the outside , and the carpets could use some shampoo - some of the sand doesn't want to get vacuumed . 
watching < PROPFIRST > Helsing 
excited about tomorrow ! hope I can sleep tonight ... 
< PROPFEMALE>'s bar is pimped out for Halloween 
gnight all , wish me luck tomorrow 
God works in mysterious ways .... 
excellent first day . lots to do so I wasn't too bored , and everyone seems really nice . 
tired .... I am not a morning person , and interesting drama to play with my mind the last couple nights ... 
being tired at 10 just feels unnatural and unholy 
I feel violated .... just watched a < PROPFIRST > Bieber video cuz I saw it had Luda too . JB is like a less talented androgynous version of < PROPFIRST > Timberlake . 
raspberry-orange-lime syllabub ftw 
bout to watch < PROPFIRST > of the Dead 
omg ... it is WAAAAAAY too early to be this tired :( 
FridAAAAAAAY ! =D 
is it 9 yet ? so ready ! 
Had an awesome night last night ! I'm exhausted though . 15 hour road trip after a full day of work and party and only 1/2-1 hour sleep in the last 36 hours - whew ! 
an excellent end to my day :) 
wow ... just had probably the best half-day ever . very excited about the future :) 
Love nights like tonight :) 
today is turning out to be quite a lovely day as well

I HATE 290 - with a burning , throbbing passion . But the reason I'm on 290 makes it all worth it :) 
Ugh ... today is not working for me . I'm officially lost at work . Have about a dozen projects mid-stream waiting on other people and I'm getting at least 3 more for every 1 I get to finish . I've lost track of what's what :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > Price - we just couldn't say goodbye ftw\ 
Love it . Sweet and romantic without being too sappy , and I love that period sound . Need to find out what period that is . Same genre as the music in Fallout 3 .

Drive faster ! \ 
Roll these < PROPFEMALE > windows down \ 
To catch my breath\ 
And then go ! \

You can be right , or you can be happy . But what if being wrong makes you unhappy ?
