They say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question\ 
their friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live ... REPOST if you are blessed enough to have at least one of these .

' s horoscope said : You tend to rely on your instincts quite a bit , but now you're drawing on even deeper wisdom -- the stuff that bubbles up now and then that seems spooky to others . Act on your intuition . This is a totaly accuracate account at the moment , crazy .

Well it's official I now have my motorcycle license :)

went on a ride to Anson and had a blast . Riding is very theraputic for me . 
is going to the White Buffalo Bikefest tomorrow , here I come ! 
just got back from the bikefest , had a blast ! 
I am sooooo grossed out by the dog right now , reminds me of why I love cats . 
just got back from the hospital , next on the list : ct scan of the brain , sonogram of my liver and then a biopsy . Also got a referal to a gastroenterologist and put back on the medicine I should have never been taken off of . 
My poor baby just woke up screaming my name several times . She said she had a bad dream that someone killed me . I held her tight and told her nothing was going to happen to me .... I felt so bad for her she was so upset . 
Got poked and prauded on , scanned and sonogramed , I will get my results back tomorrow or the next day . 
On my way to get some coffee a lady decided to pull out in front of me , while I was on my bike . I had a choice to either lay it over or run into the side of her truck . I chose to lay it over , in a puddle of water might I add ( I was not hurt ) . She came running over to me very appologetic helped me pick my bike up saying that she should have given me more room , YOU THINK ! 
“We must be willing to get rid of the life we’ve planned , so as to have the life that is waiting for us . “\

Had a dream that I was riding my motorcycle in high heals and a skimpy dress .... very ineffective might I add . 
Breakfast with grandma , good times ! 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS !! ? Promote LOVE & Acceptance not hate . 
I totally crave coffee now every night around this time :( no coffee at the casa however . 
I have to let everyone know how proud I am to have a wonderful daughter who picks reading a chapter book over the evil TV and computer games . Couldn't have a better child ! 
Abilene friends if you have a bike and would like to go for a ride tomorrow hit me up . Itching to have a nice little ride . 
Oooo yeah , delightful treat found in the freezer . Forgot I put some alchole in there . 
so < PROPFEMALE > used my brush this morning and didn't put it back where it belongs . I had to ask her to go get it and bring it to me . After searching for a few minutes she brings it back to me mangled by the dog , kids . 
hiked till the wee hours of the morn . Then got up at the butt crack of < PROPFEMALE > for fall festival setup . Got to love prior obligations . 
Finally back from < PROPFIRST > what a LLLOOONNNGGGG trip . 
Home sweet home , no better place to be ! 
Molst people have many wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it ! 
When all else fails listen to music .... content ! 
“For every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it . For every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it . For every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it . ”\ 
< PROPMALE > Panin quotes 
After dinner ride with mi familia , had a blast ! 
Finally getting some work with the company I work for , great days ahead . Contract labor sucks ! 
< PROPFEMALE > says that < PROPFEMALE > Joplin has a scratchy voice and needs to brush her hair , got to love kids and the things they say . 
I would just like everyone to know that .. even though I usually don't complain ... I absolutly HATE large crouds of stupid people . People are so ignorant ! 
Thanks to my one and only little brother ( < PROPFIRST > Turner ) I am getting a belated birthday gift on Monday , a much wanted I phone . Thanks bro , bro ... love you ! 
Spent all day long trying to fix my computer because it crashed . Finally success , didn't think I could do it but I did ! 
The most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom one's relationship has a glowing depth , beauty , and joy as the years increase . This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing , it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it . It is a sort of Divine accident . \ 
~ Sir < PROPMALE > Walpoe

Life is to short to sweat the small stuff , live life to it's fullest and never look back ! 
A Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check\ 
payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to and including their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember this fact . Happy veteran's day to < PROPFIRST > Turner , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Sweeney and all others who are serving or have served . Can't thank you enough . 
There's no greater love than the love you that have for your child . Couldn't ask for a better kid . 
Hell has no fury like a woman scorned !

“The most terrible poverty is loneliness , and the feeling of being unloved . ” - Mother < PROPFEMALE >

Change your Facebook profile picture to your favorite cartoon character from your childhood and invite friends to do the same until December 6th . The goal is to have no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of childhood memories . This is for Violence/abuse Against Children . 
Hmmmm what can I say ... it's good to be me ! 
Everything happens for a reason , people change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so you can appreciate them when they're right , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can come together . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE >

Why does life have to be so complicated ? 
In the hospital getting pumped full of fluids , pain and nausea meds . Thank goodness I have the Internet to keep me company . 
What a BAD day ! 
The only people that you can truly count on to be there for you is your family ( well in my case that is . ) 
Yesterday when at the hospital my mom told < PROPFEMALE > that I was there to pass a kidney stone . < PROPFEMALE>'s reply , \who's she passing it to . \ " I love that little girl ! " 
All good things must come to an end .

Worked my ass off at HSU today , tired . 
Got a job at Rentech . They told me that I would be here from 8-12 until I catch on then around 11:30 came to me and asked me to stay till 5 , must be doing something right :) 
Snuggle time with < PROPFEMALE > , success ! 
Asked to stay till five again today , I think they like me :) 
Working all day and all night tonight . Just not on my nature to say no . 8 AM- 10 PM

Cars in the shop and had to ride the bike to work this morning . I couldn't believe how many bikes were on the road when it was 40 degrees outside , that's dedication . 
My baby has been working on benchmark tests for the TAKS . I got an email from her teacher today saying she made a 94 on her reading and a 97 on her math , I couldn't be more proud . 
So nice to get a 40 hour a week pay check :) 
There's two things I love more than anything in this world < PROPFEMALE > first and foremost and riding my bike . 
Work , work , work , work , work .... That's all I got to say . 
Update : < PROPFEMALE > took her task yesterday and made a 98 she missed one .... one smart cookie = one happy momma ! 
I went to a store yesterday after painting on a house , I was covered from head to toe in paint . The associate asks me if I'm a painter , WTF that's along the lines of did your tattoos or suspensions hurt . Come on people think about what your going to say b4 you say it . 
Drowning Pool tonight , can't wait ! 
Drowning Pool was awesome , good times had by all . 
So ready to go to < PROPFIRST > this weekend to spoil my baby on her birthday . 
is watching the original Karate Kid movies with < PROPFEMALE > . 
is at the park with my beautiful little girl . 
Broken , torn , battered and bruised .... an 18 yr old ran a stop light when I was on my bike . There was no time to react . I t- boned her and I think I went over her car . Of course being the good citizen she is she left me and my friend unconscious laying on the ground . But decided to grace the accident scene with her presence after ditching her car and picking up a few friends . Short version of course . 
Having only one eye to see out of sux ! 
You know I thought w everyday I would feel better but , I feel worse . New pain every day , not looking good for me :( I know what I never wanted to know , what it feels like to get hit by a car , PAIN ! 
All this accident has caused is problems , so tired of this &@/ \!?#" 
Back at work today , not feeling better but you do what you got to do . 
I hate the fact that I look like I got in a physical altercation and I'm tired of explaining to people who don't know me that I was in a wreck when there rude enough to ask me why and who I was fighting . 
TGIF ! 
Tonight was a good night ! 
Mmmm chicken fried bacon ! 
Music makes this rocking world go round ! 
Just drove a < PROPMALE > Cross Bone , that confirms it I love motorcycles and will have another one . Couldn't have a bigger grin on my face :) 
So out of 10 helmets to choose from , one in the bag on the back of my bike . I choose to were zero ..... lesson learned the hard way :-/ 
5 DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN .... ( 1 ) FINE -this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are RIGHT & YOU need to SHUT UP . ( 2 ) NOTHING -means SOMETHING & u need to be WORRIED ( 3 ) GO AHEAD -this is a dare not permission DO NOT DO IT . ( 4 ) WHATEVER -is a woman's way of saying **** YOU . ( 5 ) THAT'S OK -she is thinking long & hard on HOW & WHEN you will pay for your mistake . Re-post if u agree
