Apparently 1800 wasn't good enough ... Shooting for 2100 now . 
Why is there only a ' like ' button ? Where's all the hate people ? 
Who wants to see Toy Story 3 ? 
I'm sooo bored !! Someone ! Let's do something ! 
Alright ... Well since I'm a sheep ... \ 
\How many of us really know everybody on \ 
Toy Story 3 was the best movie I've seen in a while . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > cried ... Uly , Mondo , and I almost cried ... 
I feel like I'm about to pass out right now ... \ 
I got a total of one hour of sleep before < PROPFEMALE>'s crappy clock woke me up and knocked me off the couch at 3 in the morning ... 
Listening to \You've Got A Friend In Me\ " in Spanish ... " 
It's too hot outside and too cold in my house ... \ 
I need a sunroom like < PROPFEMALE>'s ... 
I'm bored ... Let's go do something tomorrow . 
I'm going to bed and hoping for something fun to happen tomorrow . 
What is this crap ? \ 
No teenager should be up before 10 o'clock in the summer . 
I need something to do ... \ 
Anything going on today or tomorrow ? 
So I come on facebook one last tIme before I go to sleep . And what do I find ? My News Feed has been flooded with < PROPFEMALE>'s videos ... I have to click ' older posts ' like three times to find the most recent REAL post . \ 
Shame on you < PROPFEMALE > . 
Who wants to give me $200 ? 
Going to bed at 4 in the morning . Maybe it's just me , but something is not right here . 
I wish AP English didn't require a summer assignment ... 
Is it just me or does this summer feel like one giant weekend ? I mean that in a bad way . 
So ... I couldn't sleep at all last night . So when the sun came up around 6 am . I went for a 3 mile or so jog ... Who the hell is up at 6 o'clock ? No one ! 
Im < PROPFEMALE > bored ... How come no one is on facebook at 7 am ? I thought that it would be popular at this time . \ 
www.formspring.me/nschwaia 
Who wants to go do something ? Text me . 
Yay ... I'm up early again ... Wtf ? I'm going back to sleep . 
Wince fireworks arent legal in West Sac ( fucking hippos ) , we all went to a party in Rancho . We had a good $150 or so worth of fireworks and let them fly . Fun stuff . 
Who wants to give blood with me on the 16th ? 
My dad gave my mom a choice ... A car or a fancy coffee machine . She chose the coffee machine and now has it in her bathroom ... I'll never see her again . :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Einsel is officially a Creepy Creeper . 
People suck :/ 
Second Saturday was pretty fun . All was good except for < PROPFEMALE > making me park on like 16th and T ... Hell of a time getting back to my car , and even worse getting out of downtown . 
Wow . I've done absolutely nothing today . I didn't know it was possible to be this unproductive . 
Anyone wanna go do something ? < PROPFEMALE > out ? Hit tennis ? Anyone ? 
I've rediscovered MySpace . 
Just got my AP English books from Amazon . \ 
' How to Read Literature Like a Professor ' and ' Gulliver's Travels'\ 
Started reading the professor one . It's not bad or anything , it just doesn't catch my interest . 
Facebook is being douchy 
\I tied my hair up because when it gets in my face I can't breath . \ " \ 
So my car has a stupid brake fluid leak and now the breaks don't work . My dad says he'll fix it , but it will probably be december by the time he does . 
What the hell is a Dialectric Journal ?!? \ 
I hate this assignment . 
I wanna see ' Dinner For Schmucks ' when it comes out . 
Woo ! My dad fixed my car and now I'm mobile ... again ! 
I'm thinking about just calling up my counseler and dropping AP English ... I know it's the easy way out , but I don't need this class ! 
This kind of mind fucking only happens so often . \ 
Watch Inception . Do it . 
< PROPFEMALE > , I've decided I'm going to see about dropping AP English , but today was so boring I read almost all of the book I chose for it ... I'm probably going to do the summer assignment out of pure boredom . 
I wanna go to the state fair ... 
Woo ... Yet another boring day of summer . \ 
In other ' news ' ... My family is at an impasse for what to have for dinner . 
< PROPFEMALE > Wyckoff is officially the best person on this planet , right now . 
Found out an amazing thing just now ... \ 
I can charge my iTouch from my xbox360 . The world is a great place . 
< PROPMALE>'s for dinner with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Fun stuff , played Red Dead at < PROPFEMALE>'s . I might never get my 360 back . \ 
I guess it's time for bed . 
Sooo bored today ... Nothing is happening . 
I guess i'm going to bed . Again ... \ 
\ 
This is like the 11,000 th time I've done this . I need to get off this routine . 
Insomnia ... Yay ...

Damn you < PROPFIRST > ! I saw slenderman on my way home last night . 
I'm gonna be pissed if < PROPFEMALE > is dead . 
< PROPFEMALE > ... The Vanagon I was going to get is a no-go . The wiring has been completely butchered and he last owner should be beaten . 
Being a hooker is exactly like fishing . 
Who wants to do stuff today ?

' Night people . 
My family and I were walking around Wal-Mart and passed the condoms while my mom was asking if we needed anything and throwing out suggestions of what to get . She asked me if I needed condoms . XD\ 
Told her that I'd buy them on my own time ... By myself . \ 
I can only imagine how embarassing buying condoms with parents can be .

The Book of < PROPMALE > was great . Clash of The Titans was ' eh ... ' but entertaining . 
Ten more dollars ... 
Why does it have to be so difficult to find a job ? 
The people at Tower Mart offered me a job . She asked how old I was , then told me I had to be 18 .... Disappointment ...

#15 \ 
You're such an annoying person and I hate you ! \ 
Nah , just kidding ! \ 
You're a snazzy individual who had no care whatsoever for the health of her hair . You belong in the 50's ( except for the hair thing ... ) . I like that you're one of my more intelligent friends , even though you don't make great decisions . \ 
Oh yeah , I like the fact that you are capable of an intelligent conversation too . 
#995 \ 
You can be annoying at times . I suppose you're one of the people that I would think is intelligent . Blah Blah Blah , stuff and other stuff ... \ 
All else aside , if it were a zombie apocalypse and I had to choose who to bring along for survival . You would be on the list . You could be useful . 
#3 \

Just got back from the AP US Government study session ... \ 
Where was everyone ?! I was seriously the only person there ... 
Doesn't make sense , does it ? Homeless in the US go without eating . Elderly in the US go without needed medicines . Mentally ill in the US go without treatment . American troops go without proper equipment . American veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'M IN THE 1% . 
Finished applying at Target ... Again . \ 
Where else ? 
Feel like crap ' cause I'm sick , so I take a nap . I get through an hour of that and my mom wakes me up so I can go with her down to the shop and drive her horrible old car home so that there's room at the shop for the shipment that's coming in tomorrow that I'm being forced to help unpack during school . \ 
Not a good day/week . 
You know what's great for a soar throat when you're sick ? \ 
Ice cream ... \ 
Now if only I had some . 
I LOVE POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP . And don't know how to update my own status . 
Anyone wanna tell me what letter grade they think an 80.05% is ? 
I'm just gonna quote Uly Sirrayna Gonzalez here ... \ 
\Who wants to watch me play through Portal in 45 minutes ? \ " \ 
Driving home today and I passed an old woman sitting at a bench . Eyes closed and a peaceful smile on her face , like the life she lived was and still is a happy one . I dunno why , but it was almost reassuring .
