Leaving for the beach . Still haven't packed . /-: 
Just drove seven hours . Had a breakdown freak hysterical laugh and cry fit . 
Greetings from the beach ! 
Sleeping with a baby = no sleep and a face full of diaper . 
I need to sleep . No sleep for days leads to bizarre hallucinations . I slathered myself in sunblock multiple times . I'm still burnt . Dermalogica-I am so pissed . ran into a chair and busted a vein in my leg . Sleep . Sleep . Sleep . The ground is rolling . Oh yeah , < PROPMALE > pulled my top off at the pool . : -0 and I fell down in front of everyone . This has been a beach update . 
I do believe this may very well be my very last family vacation . I feel like I've been on a trip w 3 babies and my mom . I have never been so tired . 
Is so tired she could cry .
