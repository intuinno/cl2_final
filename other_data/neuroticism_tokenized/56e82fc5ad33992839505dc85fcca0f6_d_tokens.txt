feels terrible and can't sleep because of it ... :( 
needs a haircut . 
Ninja Warrior Marathon !!! New one at 6:30 !!! 
Ninja Killer : Slider Jump . RIP All-Stars ! :( 
just saw Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .... and cried . Twice . 
hates her new haircut and doesn't want to leave the house until it grows out again :( 
had an amazing time at Kings Dominion with < PROPFIRST > today ^_^ ... and is slowly accepting her new hair . 
loves all of her friends oh so much . Parties and hugs and love . I'm going to miss you all !!! :'( 
Tentative dates : Going down to do forms and such around the 20th . Not staying ! I still don't know when I'll be moving , but it won't be before the 20th . I may not be moving until very early August .... 
is supposedly taking a trip down to < PROPFEMALE > next weekend . Supposedly . 1 month until first day of classes ..... v.v 
Finally ! Stupid AP scores coming after everyone else's! 
is in love , had an amazing day and loves her flowers :D 
kinda really sucks at bowling . And even managed to cut herself 3 times on a bowling ball . Figures , huh ? 
Last week in VA ! I'm going to miss everyone so much !!! Except you , < PROPFEMALE > . You're coming with me . 
Saturday is moving day . 2 days left .... 
Last day :'( But there's absolutely nobody I'd rather spend it with . 
loves all of her friends from < PROPFEMALE > so very much !! Keep in touch !! 
finally has internet for a brief period after 3 days without !! Man was it torture ... 
is in her new dorm and FINALLY has internet !! It's a nice little room . Classes start on Monday ! 
loves making friends through a battle of wits and a few bruises to the ego . Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes !!! ( those who wished me a happy birthday , that is ... ) 
has only had one week of class and is already sick . Perfect ... >_< 
There's been a mystery flu going around campus down here . Found out yesterday what it is . Swine flu ! A new friend of mine got it and was asked to leave campus . And I'm conveniently sick . If I get swine flu because my immune system hates me , my life officially sucks . 
has a really runny nose and is almost out of tissues . How pathetic :( On the upside pretty much all of my other symptoms are gone except for nose-related stuff . I think I'm allergic to < PROPFEMALE > ... 
had to get up really early to go get a credit card . Not quite sure whether to be happy or pissed . 
absolutely despises dorm internet . This is the first time in weeks that I can see everything on facebook !! 
Oh ! I forgot ! Apparently my identity has been stolen and I have fraudulent charges on a credit card that I never owned . Joy , huh ? >_< 
is very sick and very lonely . Only upside of today is football . Let's hope that doesn't suck too . 
fell down a total of three flights of stairs today . Sometimes I don't like the rain . 
has a friend in math class that loves the old tv show Dinosaurs too . And I thought I had escaped that when I left < PROPFEMALE > . Damn . 
really really is getting tired of being disappointed . No visit to < PROPFEMALE > for me until Thanksgiving . Off to drown my sorrows in soda and oreos . I miss you so much < PROPFIRST > :'( 
fought Tropical Storm < PROPFEMALE > . And won . I have slipped 6 times today so far , and haven't fallen once !! And I'm in flip-flops with no tread on the bottom . I consider it a victory . 
kinda really has the most random < PROPFEMALE > to go bowling . How odd . 
is : awake way too early , incredibly hot , dizzy , and nauseous . Great way to start a Tuesday . 
RIP Uga VII , 2008-2009 . You're cute skin rolls will be dearly missed . :'( 
So , I'm in < PROPFEMALE > but there's a change of plans . I'm leaving for < PROPFEMALE > on Friday ( night , I think ) so I have less time here than I thought ... 
is so very happy and so in love :) 
Holy crap , Detroit won !!! I love you Stafford , you sexy beast of a quarterback <3 
burnt her hand on the side of an evil new toaster . Damn . 
has found the one thing she hasn't missed the slightest since moving . Even in the basement I can hear the fighting and stuff being thrown . Happy Thanksgiving ..... 
will soon be on her way back to < PROPFEMALE > . Sadness . I'll be back in three weeks !!! 
wishes the snow everyone is talking about would come visit her down here :( 
is so frustrated about the stupid online store that magically misplaced my order for < PROPFIRST>'s Christmas present and has no record of it . 
SNOOOOOOOW IS COMING !! I'm so excited , and glad the precipitation following me in < PROPFEMALE > and nearly killing me is actually gonna freeze and fall in snowflakes ^__^ 
.... I love the snow , but it could potentially impede my going-to-see-my-boyfriend-to-play-in-the-snow-together abilities . Damn . 
..... Damn . 
just got back from her love's house ^_^ His daddy was so nice to come get me !! 
Back to classes today .... Damn . I should not have to be awake yet :( 
5:45 class . Holy shit is it cold outside . And dark ..... It's an accident waiting to happen . Remember me when I become a statistic !! 
is back in < PROPFEMALE > . Had a great day with < PROPFIRST > :) 
had her piece of crap laptop fixed by her lovely brother . I still hate this thing .... 
apparently has monkey feet . Thanks < PROPFIRST > , love you too . 
loves < PROPFIRST>'s family because they're all so nice to me ! < PROPFIRST>'s mean to me .... but I suppose I love him too ... 
had a great day with < PROPFIRST > and his great family . But mostly with < PROPFIRST > <3 
has a nasty headache . I would take an aspirin , but that wouldn't make life any less annoying . 
had a fantastical day keeping < PROPFIRST > company at his bowling league games . Ah , the sexual innuendo we used there . Great day . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Dorton , if you EVER scare me like this again , I'm going to beat the shit out of you . 
Nothing like a night of tears and bad dreams to make you wake up looking terrible with puffy eyes . 
is all kinds of a sick mess . 
only just woke up half an hour ago . And I still feel miserable . Pollen season is not a time best spent in a basement bedroom with no air circulation and no dehumidifier . 
is apparently < PROPFEMALE>'s \Love Muffin \"....." 
doesn't like that she's apparently predictable enough for others to use to their own advantage ..... That just doesn't sit well with me .... 
\Never get Freudian with a man with a pickle . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > McCoy " 
may be on a bowling team with < PROPFIRST > in the near future ? Gotta think about it . 
had a great , great Thursday :) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > said that the normal man does not torture . Generally it is the tortured that become torturers . 
had a so-so night . Had fun bowling and won a free game , but I was scolded and I now have the highest handicap in the league . Joy . 
had to go home early from a sleepover with the besties because of a terrible headache behind my left eye :( Of all the times to be sick ..... 
Bowling Pt . 2 Tonight . Here's hoping I can do better this time around and not embarrass myself . 
Well .... my first game was much better anyway . Probably wouldn't have sucked after that if I didn't start feeling sick . 
These days a good day seems really hard to come by . I've had okay days , but not one really great day for quite a while . And not just great for me , great for the people I love too . I'm still waiting on that . 
< PROPFIRST>'s momma bought me a brand new ball . Which made me feel bad that my first game with it was a 51 . My first two games were good for me though ( 105 , 97 ) . Just wish my last game was that good . 
had a really great day today , but feels kinda awful . Probably getting sick . And I want cuddle time :( 
just randomly woke up and is cold and very dizzy . This is not a good sign . 
bowled decently tonight . 132 , 82 , 81 . Last game was with my new ball , which I have partially started to understand . I need to praaaaaaaactice !!! \ 
\ 
Though I am very proud of my 132 :) 
Bad day . Bad mood . I want to sleep through the rest of today so nothing else bad can happen . 
just walked across the street to Bloom for some groceries . I don't mind playing Frogger with 208 , but I would like them to mow the median . Some of those plants are sharp as hell and my toes do not appreciate it . 
My phone just died thanks to an \account error\ " from Sprint . Lovely . So I'll be out of commission for a while . Hopefully it'll be all settled in the morning . " 
' s phone is now turned back on :) 
is gonna have a good day at Kings Dominion with < PROPFIRST > today :) 
Intimitador 305 at KD = Freakin ' Awesome !! New favorite coaster for < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Good day . Very good day . My body hurts like hell , but it was so fun . Up early tomorrow to prepare to go out yet again for a pool party :) 
got sunburnt so badly . Oh my god it hurts so bad . I was outside for maybe an hour . What the hell . I can't move ..... 
was in a car accident today on the way to spend the week with < PROPFIRST > and his mom in < PROPFEMALE > Beach . We're all fine and will continue the trip . Tomorrow , off to the beach ! 
Thank you everybody for wishing me a happy birthday !! 
..... A freaking cricket in my room kept me up all night , and now I feel awful . Lovely . 
is finally getting a bed of her own !! :) Now maybe my back won't always feel like it's trying to snap itself in half when I wake up in the morning ... 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > football , how I missed you so <3 
just submitted an application to CVS . Hoping so much that they hire me . 
Well , I'm apparently a mean , cruel , and insensitive person , according to my lover because I moved away when he farted . Lovely . 
Even though < PROPFEMALE > lost , that second half was one hell of a game . Not bad , Arkansas , not bad . 
My laptop's keyboard died :( I'm using a wireless plugged in one until I can get a replacement . Hurry up , Nee-chan ! <3 
got an SVGA cable in the mail so now her laptop is connected with her HD tv . This is utter epicness . I swear . And it's even better because my laptop has it's own remote so I can control it from my couch like it was just on tv . Awesome . I'm never leaving my room again . 
First game Stafford is back and healthy , and the Lions beat the Redskins . What an awesome Halloween game . 37-25 <3 
I get so much done when < PROPFIRST>'s not around to text . It's kinda creepy . 
I'm trapped . I don't know what to do . All I know is I'm not strong enough to keep living this life . 
DAMN IT !! Lions-Jets tied at 20-20 , going into overtime . SO stressful !! My poor baby is hurt yet again :'( 
That figures , Lions winning almost all game , then Stafford gets hurt and the Lions crash and burn . Freaking figures . 
Note to self : that one video file that made my computer flip out was not alone . Any mp4 file will cause a continuous Windows Explorer crash loop . Lovely . 
Oh < PROPMALE > Potter , how you make me cry . How you make me cry so hard that someone 3 seats down from me passed me a tissue down the row . 
Just finished my assessment for a Pharmacy Tech job at Walgreens . I'm gonna call the Pharmacy Manager in a few hours to talk to him . And I hear a tech at Giant is leaving so I may be considered for that , too . I really hope I can land one of these jobs .... 
Has won 8 coupons for free boxes of Toaster Strudels and 4 came today ! I probably shouldn't be this excited about Toaster Strudels .... 
Liar Game ruined my dreams . It was great . But it ruined my dreams . 
Only I could manage to really hurt myself on a box of instant pancakes .... 
Boom Boom . 
I had such a wonderful anniversary . I got a beautiful necklace as a present , I got to spend the day with < PROPFIRST > and part of it with his mom and < PROPMALE > , and I scored really well in bowling . Great day <3 
My sister just left after just three days of being here . I miss her already :'( \ 
Daisuki Nee-chan !! <3 <3 <3 Hurry up and come back again soon !! 
Got called in by Walgreens today for a skill assessment . If I pass I have an interview on Wednesday ! So excited !!
