Really good last day of a very trying year . Wrapping up a few loose ends and moving forward with some awesome blessings and new beginnings ... Looking forward to a very focused , kick ass year ! Wishing you all every happiness in the new year :) 

The time to be happy is now . The thing to treasure is exactly what you hold in your hands . Forcing change , denying what's true , worrying about tomorrow does not work - it is only by accepting life as it is today that you will become truly < PROPMALE > . Right here , right now , < PROPFEMALE > the moment you hold in your hands . 
was up at 5:45 . Out the door at 6:30 for the first day of summer school . Less than 3 < PROPMALE > and 24 minutes later , I pulled back in the drive . Traffic stinks . It's going to be a LONG 5 weeks ... 
can't believe it's been a whole year ... Miss you daddy ... 
is SO done ... 
had a great day ... worked all morning , then the beach with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , then dinner with < PROPFEMALE > at < PROPFEMALE>'s ... now if I could only find < PROPFEMALE > for an evening hike .... :) 
Looking forward to having dinner in Ventura then heading to O'Learys to hear < PROPMALE>'s band play ... 
is getting ready to head to Ojai ... for a few hours or a few days - haven't decided yet ... 
had a very productive day and is looking forward to the weekend filled with friends from Ojai :) 
12 years have passed although it seems like just yesterday ... miss you mom . 
Our office is moving today ... going to miss the beauty of Town Center Drive ...

is hoping to get everything I need to get done this morning finished so I can go to the beach later this afternoon ... 
So much for the beach .... Oh well , at least the last item of the day takes me to Salt Creek ! :) 
Be yourself . Everyone else is already taken . 
Intangible factors are at play . RESPECT THEM . 
My son is leaving for college today ... mixed feelings ... 
Gotta love a song that goes ... Toes in the water , ass in the sand , not a worry in the world , a cold beer in my hand ... life is good today , life is good today ...

Given the week , I'll post it again ... The time we need to trust the journey is when it looks like we can't . Thoughts and prayers out to all firefighters and their families . May strength be with you ... 
People have a way of becoming what you encourage them to be - not what you nag them to be . \ S . N . < PROPMALE > "

My 16 year old son cracks me up . With a smile on his face , he asked for a \down day\ " from school . I said no . Then he asked if I realized it's been 5 weeks since he's had a day off and wasn't this tragic . OMG . Someone call social services .... Got a hug and an \ " I love you mom\ " as he got out of the car . Totally dig that kid ... " 
is enjoying the rain ... and finally my first night to relax in weeks ... 
realizes the last two months of my life has caught up with me - It's finally time for a lay around the house day , do nothing day and I am so going to do just that ... 
Whoever said staying home to pass out Halloween < PROPFEMALE > is on glue . 30 people < PROPMALE > , including adults . I should have been red cuppin in in the street watching my kids have fun . < PROPFEMALE > , if you were feeling better , I'd head down there for a dose of Mables ! Oh well , maybe next year ! 
is picking up < PROPMALE > tonight . Can't wait to see him ! 
had a great weekend ... Don't think I'd change a thing :) 
The time we most need to trust the journey is when it looks like we can't . 
had a really peaceful weekend ... Love days like these ! :) 
\Blessed are those that can give without remembering and receive without forgetting\ " Unknown . Hope everyone has a very blessed Thanksgiving Day ! :) " 
\The journey of a thousand < PROPMALE > begins with a single step\ " Take it . Lao Tzu " 
It's not what happens to you , it's how you handle it that defines who you are ...

Neither time nor distance can defy a true friendship ... 
There are ups and downs in a life for a reason . Each moment provides us with the perfect amount of BEING . All we can do is BE . All we can be is PRESENT . Just be . Just breathe . 
Old friend just talked me into stepping WAY outside of my comfort zone this morning ... hope I don't regret it ... Now off to lunch with two of my favorite guys from the office to regain some of the normalcy lost in the last couple of weeks and to laugh til it hurts ... :) 
< PROPMALE > wants me to make homemade pepperoni pizza for dinner tonight . Oh joy .

Give yourself permission to be un-busy . Give yourself an hour or a day to simply be . Allow yourself the luxury of a small retreat . Allow your spirit time to be restored . Even God took a day of rest . 
Perfect Southern California day . Love it here !
