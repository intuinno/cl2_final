the epidemic has spread ...... Sophia has a 100.8 fever & chills & headache :( Antibiotics tomorrow 
As we were snacking on strawberries my daughter says : esto es mucho delicioso ! All I can say is wow ! since she hasn't been around any Spanish for the past 2 months ! And I'm glad she got in the bilingual school for fall :) 
Please keep < PROPFEMALE > (& I & my mom ) in your thoughts/hearts/prayers tomorrow , it will be a tough one for her (& us ) . She is so very brave & strong !! 
Agh ! Woke up because my daughter did , got her back bed and now I can't get back to sleep !! 
Mmmmmm to homemade biscuits 
Can't wait for the second messy playdate of the summer in my backyard ! It's going to be a blast with 40 parents and kids !!!! 
Last day to get up ' late ' .... tomorrow this is when I'll be at work ! :) 
is remembering to breathe .... very excited about being able to take < PROPFEMALE > to her first day of K tomorrow ! but not looking forward to the afternoon ( and the reason I took off from the 2nd day of classes at work)\ 
Keep us in your thoughts & prayers , I'm hoping for the best in this situation but have been told it's not likely :-( 
Feels such relief ... not only did < PROPFEMALE > have a great first day if K , but other things went so much better than I had been hoping . I hadn't realized how much those other things had been weighing me down for the past 2 months .... being able to relax is amazing . 
Anyone else going to the Greek Festival tomorrow ? < PROPFEMALE > and I are going in the late A.M. 
I cannot understand the legal system we have .... it is so f*ed up ! Why doesn't it protect the people it's supposed to ?? 
Four days til Wilmington ! 
So .. I haven't dressed up in a costume in a while ... But < PROPFEMALE > said this year she wouldn't dress up OR go trick or treating unless I am dressed up ... Not sure if I believe her , but , any suggestions for costumes ??!? 
2 days until Wilmington for the weekend .......... any suggestions on what to do ? 
As a student , did you ever decide to change pants in the middle of class after doing no work for 3 days ?!? As a teacher , I personally don't recommend adding that to your school career ! 
Just 6 years ago today at 5 am I gave birth to my beautiful daughter ; she's lost 3 teeth and started K this year where she is learning to read and write ( in Spanish ) . I can't wait to see what the future holds for her :) \ 
< PROPFEMALE > wanted to write , so here are her words : te kiero mucho < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
S: ( after 3 minutes on the phone with _) today is my real birthday .... did you forget ? \ 
_ : .... no .... 
Change your fb profile pic to a childhood cartoon this weekend ... the goal : to raise awareness of child abuse by reminding ourselves of our childhood until Monday Dec . 6th ; copy and paste this to encourage your friends to do the same . \

Had an awesome fun time with the SPARKies last night ! Just the break I've been needing ! 
Third day of congestion that is getting progressively worse , additionally headaches and aches are being added today .... ICK !! And ... Sophia is not feeling well today also , blah ! 
So f*in cold !! i hate the cold ..... i loathe the cold .... if i didn't want to live near family & friends , i would so be in a much much warmer clime ! * grr * 
All I want for Christmas is ONE day where there is no anger/irritability/low self-esteem/etc that seemingly erupts from the littlest triggers and out of the blue .... I don't mind the regular tantrums that kids have ... I would willingly trade these behaviors to have those :( 
Cold and tired = an early early bedtime under thick covers ( officially 4.5 layers ) with a book .... and .... vacation officially begins !! :) 
Heading to Wilmington !!!! 
damn keyboard !! i _a_e t_ree letters t_at de_ided to quit on me randomly ? w_y ??? Bet you _an't guess w_i__ letters by t_e gaps in t_is message !! 
I really need to get to bed earlier !! These early mornings come way too quickly ... 
Is it bad that I am almost too tired tonight to stay up long enough for my S to go to sleep so I can be the tooth < PROPFEMALE > ???? 
About to watch Resident Evil 4 .... we'll see how long that lasts ! Me & scary movies alone = horrible horrible combo !! All the lights are on ... and I've got work to occupy me , but for some reason I like the Resident Evil movies so I'm going to try ! 
Made it through the movie .... I don't think it was as scary as the first ones ! 
No school in CMS tomorrow ! 
First off , if your child is feeling sick don't send them out in the snow to play all day with their friends . Second , when I ask if it is ok for your child to spend the night ( I presume they are healthy due to #1 above ) , say no !! And when I have to wake up at 6:30 because your child feels like throwing up , answer your damn phone ! 
Just saw it ... CMS is closed again tomorrow ! 
Early bedtime tonight- I hope ! Tried that last night and couldn't get to sleep , then kept waking up ! Wish me luck on the praxis 2 test bright and early tomorrow !!!! 
What am I doing at 4:52 AM ? Going back to bed since < PROPFEMALE > just woke me up with a 100 F temp that seems to be getting higher , oh joy ! :( 
Agghhhhh !!! Somedays I feel like I'm losing my mind ! < PROPFEMALE>'s in blow-up volcano mode for 20+ minutes now .... 
Ugh .... I wish we were spending this beautiful day outside , but < PROPFEMALE>'s on day 2 with a fever .... so we are taking it easy today ! 
I * heart * < PROPMALE > Horror .... glad Glee is doing a re-run since I missed it the first time ! Love the fact that some of the old cast made guest appearances too ! \ 
Glad to have some reason to smile today .... rough rough day 
Sara : I am making 3 different things this weekend with wine , tonight we're having vodka sauce with < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Me : vodka sauce with < PROPFEMALE > ?? Why with < PROPFEMALE > ?!? \ 
Sara : Why does there have to be a reason ? If you must know , it's because I miss my boyfriend ( D . < PROPFEMALE > ) 
Anyone in < PROPFEMALE > interested in picking < PROPFEMALE > up from school and watching her until about 6 ? Mandatory training on Tuesday for me from 2:30 to 5:30 next week at work , fun fun . Private msg me please ! 
UGH ! Anyone else have problems with iTunes ?? It just doesn't work when I sync anymore , and it's not my phone , it's iTunes .... it's constantly crashing . I love the iPhone I'm hating this problem !
