1 exam down , 2 to go . Then homework . 
Second exam down ( for what little its worth ) , and half of Calc out of the way . That leaves Comp Sci exam , the rest of Calc , Fagulla Report , and Circuits . 
Knocked out most of Circuits , still have the rest of Calc and the Fagulla report , but tomorrow promises to be relatively relaxing , compared to today anyway .

2010 - Day 7 : Kroger has Easter < PROPFEMALE > out , and its on sale . * facepalm * Also , through simple logic and observation , I may have figured out why people are posting seemingly random colors as their status . Am I right ? I don't really care .

is skipping Government to study for the Econ Exam . 
is having extreme difficulty focusing on Economics .

Headache . Government . Not going back to Econ tonight . 
is liking the fact that dropping Econ jumped his GPA from a 3.1 to a 3.8 . 
is wishing he knew where his SD Card with all his writing on it was . This is why I don't like vacations . I inevitably lose things . 
[ He rode a blazing saddle . He wore a shining < PROPFEMALE > . His job to offer battle , to bad men near and far . He conquered fear and he conquered hate . He turned dark night into day . He made his blazing saddle , a torch to light the way . ]
