Dear Facebook , I greatly appreciate the new layout . Not only do you mess around with my sanity , you make it so hard to find the logout button once I have lost my sanity . Applications NEVER work anymore and my profile is constantly in disarray . And no , I did not magically become a fan of \Can this Sexy Potato get more fans than Miley Cyrus ? \ " I was pretty sure that I was trying to click the darn chat box . Thanks again "

robison . 
going to have to do some thinking as to what to write in yearbooks tomorrow ... 
I was just talking with my friends during yearbook signing and Mr. Strong comes up to me . My \yearbook\ " is actually a composition notebook covered with pretty scrapbooking paper because I always think the school annuals are to expensive . \ 
is liking Lake Oswego , Oregon ! The sun is shining , the tank is clean ... AND WAS 75 DEGREES TODAY ! Heck yess . 
coming home today . gotta finish that robison and whitesell outline sometime . 
mostly ... ( in a loose sense of the term ) done with homework . off to tutor math to a little fourth grader 
? You have suffered enough\ 
And warred with yourself\ 
It's time that you won\ 
Take this sinking boat and point it home\ 
We've still got time\ 
Raise your hopeful voice you had a choice\ 
You've made it now ? 
robison presentation today ... 6:45 am . can't wait to get it over 
spirit strings ? I'll add it to \woof bump energy\ " Thank you Robison ... you are definitely a \ " different\ " individual " 
should probably be practicing her sophomore exhibition speech ... :/ 
wishes she could go to the High School worship @ Believers , but sadly ... sophomore exhibition consumes her life . * sigh * 
? Just don't give up , I'm working it out . Please don't give in . I won't let you down . ? 
The sun is shining , the tank is clean :) 
Congrats GHHS Seniors , you've made it :) Have a good graduation . 
ahh yes . coaching lacrosse to middle schoolers in the lovely weather . coming home to yummy watermelon :) summer is here ! 
It's the third anniversary < PROPMALE > family . I find some comfort in the fact you are resting peacefully in Heaven , however it doesn't completely remove the sorrow . Rest in Peace . 
The saying \Life's not fair\ " is never very convincing nor does it settle the score . " 
Oh goodness . 2 1/2 more days . But this year is different . I feel like there is another month to go . The weather is poopy . And the teachers are not slowing down - I have a test in my last period of the last day of the school year . Lame . Not your typical \throw class parties and goof off the last week of school kinda thing\ " . Arg . " 
ahhh bubble wrap . 
Is now an upper classman ! But it feels really weird . When I was in elementary school , the high schoolers were huge-amongously tall , mature and super smart . I am none of these things , so it's < PROPFEMALE > weird !! 
Sometimes I wish there was one person that could just figure me out . Like just know exactly what I was thinking . Then I wouldn't be left alone to dwell on things . \ 
But then again , what if that one person wasn't one that I felt \deserved\ " to be that person . I guess by telling everything I have the choice to pick the people I feel are \ " deserving\ " . \ 
anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out sometime today ? 
Had a wonderful time at the beach , the park , and the horseys with < PROPFIRST > Hamasockyouindaface :) 
early babysitting job today . like the kids . but not the the time in which I have to wake up on a summer day . 
leaving for Chelan tomorrow !! camping in Chelan = <3 
is back from an AUH-MAH-ZING camping trip !! 
today was the day , and it wasn't the day . for the thing that happened , wishing it didn't . for the thing that didn't happen today , wishing it did . sorry to be vague , but that's how it goes sometimes . :( 
finished babysitting ... now bored . trying to evade chores . 
I know you all LOVE algebra , but for all meh wonderful buddies ... simplify : \ 
9x-7i > 3(3x-7u ) 
ho hum ... 
Happy 4th ! Don't get arrested ! 
at home today in boring nothingness ... and what makes it even better is that mymom volunteered me to check on my neighbor's dogs every two hours . so I can't leave ... ERG ! 
the sun is shining , the tank is clean ! gotta love sun ... and Finding Nemo 
is finally getting around to packing for New Oreleans ! I can't believe it's almost here ! 
Where am I going and why am I in a handbasket ? 
Just checked the 10-day forecast for New Orleans ! AAAHHHH !! Getting so excited ! 
Back in Washington !! Have to say I missed it SOOO MUCH , but I loved being down in New Orleans :) 
Oh goodness , still super tired even though I just slept more last night than in two nights before that ! But would trade sleep to be with the amazing people I got to know better on the mission trip :) Love you guys ? 
wishes she was back in New Orleans with the Believers Fellowship group 
is trying to teach herself to play guitar . fingertips haven't drawn blood yet , so its still go ahead for launch . guess it helps when you are teaching yourself on an awesome song too :) 
babysitting job cancelled ... now bored . 
nothing is better than putting music on Pandora , kicking back , and then wasting your precious life on Facebook when you should be doing AP homework . yep , feeling pretty productive . 
went to pony up this morning , doing chores now ... then babysitting until midnight . full day :) 
Going to Mt . Rainier today :D 
Spent the day up at Pike Place , the weather was perfect ! 
Leaves for England in one week !! Eeeeek !! 
Woke up at 5:30 am to babysit for 7 hours , doctor's appt = two shots . Could have either been in Canada or at Project Serve ... yet , I wouldn't have traded this day for anything . I got to read the most amazing book I have ever read and got to spend quality time with the two kids I love the most . 
checked my schedule ... apparently I didn't get into AP chem . Actually , I have NO science class at all ... I only have 5 periods . 
I've never been so happy to receive a textbook . Thank goodness my Chem book arrived before I leave ! 
hmmm ... finished packing . now wasting away my life doing facebook quizzes , which are suprisingly entertaining 
chai ... yum :) 
Have fun all you Oasis campers !! Gonna miss you guys ! 
You are now free to move ab(OUT ) the country ... hmm . I wonder why no one is one at 10:34 in the morning ... oh wait ... it's 2:30 am in Washington . And I am in a heaven full of people with British accents ! 
wishes she could type in the British accent she is desperately trying to pick up :) 
had the most amazing day :D 
heading up to Windsor Castle ... day 4 of my England adeventure . But I miss you all back home too ... meh family , meh buddies ... 
is glad all the campers from Oasis got back safely . it sure sounds as if you all had a wonderful time . 
Hey Believers Fellowship Mission Trip Buddies ! MissonLab put the Week 7 video on Youtube ! Here it is : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM12JdAbKjQ 
Brit Language Guide :\ 
queue = line\

sometimes I think British English and American English are two completely different languages . 
it's raining . 
Your battle with cancer was long and hard . And you fought it well , right up until the end . I promise to keep an eye on < PROPFEMALE > and the kids for you . Rest in Peace , < PROPFIRST > Rosenlind . 
hard day's night is an accurate statement for today 
\Life is precious 
Never thought my love for stickers would come in handy in the business world , lol :p 
Happy Friday the 13th Facebook buddies :) 
hmm ... I get off Facebook because I have things to do . I find these things unfulfilling and head back onto Facebook . Now I'm just bored . But if I get off , I will most definitely come back on , due to boredom . It's a very vicious cycle and I need a life ;) 
nighty night 
made a cheescake :) yumm . 
Leaving on a jet plane :) 
HOME ! Really tired though ... gonna be a slow day for me :) 
estoy muy cansada y quiero ir a la cama . pero , tengo mucho tarea de AP . yay ... 
ugh . headache = not fun 
\i'm a dinosaur . so rawr and stuff .. \"" 
here's the schedule . any class buddies ? \ 
1 ) Photo 2 - Potasky\ 
2 ) Ap < PROPFEMALE > and Comp - Gilbert\ 
3 ) Ap Calc - Payne\ 
4 ) Spanish 3 - Everetto\ 
5 ) Ap Chemistry - Johnson\ 
6 ) US History - Greetham 
hmm ... sunday night . 
had a good time at the last core groups :'( tonight . thus adding another thing to the list of things I missed while being away . 
time to finish off the AP homework I carefully avoided until now . smart thinking on my part ... not . 
now that AP homework is taking over my life , I'm gonna take this < PROPMALE > to say good-bye summer . it been good knowing you . it'll be a while before we get back together , like 10 months or so , but that's actually pretty soon in the grand scheme of things . <3 you ! 
wishes she could magically speak some words of wisdom 
Just when I begin to accept death , I am met with another unfortunate example of human mortality . Life is not our own . It doesn't belong to us . It never has , it never will . Death is not our own . Neither does it belong to us . It never has , it never will . Death and Life belong only to one , the One that mastered both . 
hmm ... I still don't think I have had my \oh 
hmmm ... 3.5 hours of homework on the first day of school shouldn't even be legal 
will be wearing white tomorrow :) Go TIDES ! 
fIsHbOwL ! need I say anymore ? 
her wardrobe for Fish bowl needs help !! AHHHHHH !!! Who knew that even when one owns mostly blue ... it's not enough !! 
had a great time at fIsHbOwL ! and was glad to see her fellow tide and seahawk buddies :) 
\Is a turtle without a shell homeless or naked ? \"" 
I often forget the details , but I never fully lose ties to who I was and where I was before . It just always seems so odd though , to be reunited with one's old self , even though you never thought you'd changed . 
it's our day off ... and I am doing chores and doggy-sitting . AAHHHH !!!! \ 
oh , and later I have to maybe get around to Calc homework . great . 
done with homework ! this has to be a new record ! only 2 hours ! whoop whoop ! \ 
* says under breath * I hate AP . And it should die in a hole ... painfully . 
homework in only one class ! another record broken ! 
? \I'm sittin ' on a citadel 
has no idea how she will study the Elements of Style well enough to pass < PROPMALE>'s test 
any of you who are fellow < PROPMALE > victims ... how are you guys studying for the test on EoS ? She doesn't even use the examples from the book , so I'm not really sure how this is going to work ... 
Can't wait for September 15th ... I need my weekly dose of youth group to maintain my sanity :) 
Just when I thought this would be a wonderful relaxing weekend to save me from the stress of this week ... I received homework in all classes . And a ton of it . There goes any possibility of a social life and sleep . 
is overwhelmed with the amount of homework she has to complete by a reasonable bedtime . Don't even know where to start ... 
hmm ... how to make doing homework better ? Have both facebook and I-Tunes up ... yepp :) 
Monday = tired\ 
Tuesday = re-tired : I was tired yesterday and I'm gonna be tired again tomorrow 
despite a lllllooonnngggg day at school , I am ridiculously happy . Not mch homework ... tomorrow is late state Wednesday and YOUTH GROUP IS STARTING ! AHHHH !!!! 
loves I-Tunes for their free music every week <3 
is going to have a long day tomorrow . nighty night y'll :) 
today was pretty terrible ... but talking with some buddies now is sure making up for it :) 
wishes she could be doing something more productive than facebook ... 
looks and feels like a stoned chipmunk . 
looks like < PROPMALE > from < PROPMALE > and the Chipmunks ... < PROPMALE > has the fattest cheeks 
still is a chipmunk ... although one with a few less acorns stockpiled in her cheeks 
despite the fact that I still look like a chipmunk , I will be going to school tomorrow ... 
nothing makes a long day at school better than a chai tea and facebook :) \ 
but alas , it is short lived ... off to the school after school : homework . 
the little engine that could :) although school could have been better , I feel ridiculously accomplished with all I have done since I got home ! first time in a long time when I am fully satisfied with my efforts and have such a feeling of accomplishment . it's a nice deviation from my previous pattern . 
is going stir crazy . 
is a weirdo . how many other people do you know that would go out to do yardwork , grab the shears and whenever it came time to snip something , would open and close them whilst saying \om nom nom nom\ " :D " 
oh , great . wonderful . I now am < PROPFIRST > Cullen . thank you metallic spray paint . now I'm all sparkly ... 
I only have made a dent in my summer homework corrections for AP Chem and still have plenty more from other subjects to do ... sighs . 
\I will remember you\ 
Can't wait to finish up the < PROPMALE > Into the Wild presentation board , it's gonna look great ! Props to my wonderful group members :) 
Wednesday : < PROPFIRST > to the tune of the Christmas song , It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\ 
It's the most wonderful day of the week ! \ 
An hour less prison , catch up on sleep missing\ 
Going to school in the light\ 
Youth group at 7 ( ish)\ 
( a blessing ) Like manna from heaven\ 
On Wednesday all is all right :D 
feels proud of herself . her spanish book now has a book cover ... but not just any book cover ... one made with hot pink , dark blue and tie-dye duct tape :D 
I ære ditt , skriver jeg dette på norsk ( ved hjelp av en Google oversetter , haha ) . Jeg er stolt med < PROPFEMALE > kreft skjorte til < PROPFEMALE > ne om deg . Og hvis det ikke var varmt < PROPFEMALE > , ville jeg også ha på < PROPFEMALE > apekatt hatten . Jeg er fristet til å være trist , men jeg forstår at du nå er på det stedet der kreften er lo fordi det er maktesløs . Jeg elsker deg og savner deg Besten . 
time to crank out some quality responses for Ap Comp and Lang ... although it shouldn't be too bad . Listening to Spirit and drinking yummy chai will tend to put me in a ridiculously good mood :D 
has a feeling that the massive brain-shattering AP Chemistry test tomorrow will not go well :/ 
long day ... can it be wednesday already ? or maybe friday ? 
got to actually walk her dog for the first time since summer because of the ridiculous homework load ... I had totally forgetten what outside looked like 
While washing the plum I planned to eat for breakfast , I found two stickers . I feel special :) 
me gusta mucho el grupo de jovenes :D 
had an amazing Super Smash Brothers Melee marathon with Hamasaki , and had a good time at < PROPMALE>'s making and eating yummy Jewish food :) Now my little cousins are over ! It is and has been a good day off ! 
Friends , a wonderful organization that I volunteer at needs help . They asked me to pass on the message : PLEASE help us save a life ! We are trying to raise funds to save a mare who was dumped at the saleyard . Her owners did not give her a < PROPMALE > to go through the auction ring and is slaughter bound . She recently had a foal , she is beautiful , healthy . 
food . 
Conversation with my little cousins : \ 
Jesse : What's that ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : It is tea . \ 
Jesse : Is it coffee ? \ 
Raquel : No , < PROPFEMALE > doesn't drink coffee ... wait . Do you ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : No . \ 
Jesse : AAHHHHH !! There's a spider in it ! \ 
Raquel : Let me see !!! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : There is no spider , it's a tea bag . I do not drink spider tea . \ 
Jesse : Oh . Yummy ? 
this weekend I spent the most time on doing my hair than I ever have before . No , I didn't go to any homecoming . No , not a wedding . Not to \impress\ " anyone . Why ? Dressing up for Nerd Day of course :D " 
had a great time chillin ' with the small group :) I <3 you guys ! 
Yeah , it's been a kinda pathetic Thursday , but guess what ! Thursday is just Friday < PROPFEMALE > :) 
\Who cares if you disagree ? You are not me . Who made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? So you dare tell me who to be ? Who died and made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? \ " - < PROPMALE > of Anything by < PROPFEMALE > Bareilles " 
it's wednesday < PROPFEMALE > ! 
cannot wait for youth group ! Counting on you Kortnee Alcott ! Please don't make me look like an idiot by myself ;) 
so the power goes out . \ 
the first thing I am thinking : hmmm ... I wonder how many people are gonna race to their computers to post it on facebook . \ 
the first thing Hamasaki shouts to the world : \I get to pee in the dark ! \"" 
gOiNg StIr CrAzY ! AHHHHHHHHHHHH !!! 
went to EMP for the first time . super fun :) 
is so sick of disappointment . disappointment in others , herself and humanity . 
really really really wants to go puddle jumping :D 
Either God is really really sad or he has tears of joy because he sure is crying a lot today . It's coming down in buckets sporadically . 
received a nice surprise this morning : actually being able to see daylight before going to the prison the teachers call school . 
issssss sssssuuupppppeeeerrrr eeeexxxxxcccciiiiteeeeddd fffffooooorrrrrr SSSSATTTUUUURRRRDDDDAAAAAYYYY and the corn maze with my favorite < PROPFEMALE > Pitz !! 
Dear Migraine , \ 
I appreciate the thought , but I don't need you to tell me I'm stressed . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
had an amazing time at the corn maze with my favorite < PROPFEMALE > Pitz !! 
Happy Halloween folks ! Hope yours is better than mine , ' cause I will be doing the massive amounts of homework I received from < PROPMALE > , Espanol tres , AP Chem , and History ! Yay ! Oh ! And there's more ... chores . Yep , a < PROPFEMALE > on top . 
is a unicorn :) 
Yay ! Election Day ! I don't even care about the actual election anymore , just that all the ridiculous attack ads will be over ! 
Today < PROPMALE > said that she wanted us to forget about our writing style and organization and just to \vomit all over the page\ " \ 
Like my status & I'll tell you :\ 
1 . Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds . \ 
2 . The color you remind me of . \ 
3 . My first memory of you .... \ 
4 . The animal you remind me of . \ 
5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . \ 
6 . My favorite thing about you . \ 
7 . Give you a weird nickname . 
tomorrow marks the beginning of a new saga in my life . here I come ! 
In the words of my pastor : \There is nothing demonic about stupidity\ " \ 
It's day like these that make me love my job :) 
Ah shoot . I'm bored . Truth is ... 
Three . Hours . Of . Sleep . BUT THE SLEEP DEPRIVATION WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT ! Got to see two lacrosse buddies in the process ! HP = <3 
needs a sanctuary . a place where children don't scream . dogs don't bark . the sun is shining , even when the sun refuses to come out from behind the clouds . homework doesn't exist nor does the guilt for putting it off . anyone know a place like this ? 
Hey guys , here's a project for you . Thanksgiving is on Thursday , so every day this week , post on Facebook something you are thankful for . I'll start it off . \ 
I am thankful for to be included in a wonderful group of friends at school , at church , and at lacrosse . 
I'm thankful for the childish obsession I have with snow . 
is thankful that her family is safe and has no reason to be driving out in the snow today . 
wants to go play in the snow , but without a < PROPMALE > , it's no fun :( 
Those who have Gilbert : What exactly are we supposed to write our response on for our independent reading books ? < PROPMALE > said we had to pick a passage and write something about it ... but I cannot find my sheet ? AAHHHHH !!! 
no school tomorrow 
is thankful for her amazing friends 
Happy Thanksgiving :) \ 
Remember to take a few seconds to really think about what you are thankful for . This holiday is not just another excuse to eat ourselves silly ... although at times , it feels that way , haha 
tomorrow's only Saturday !? WHAT !? No ... 
“Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter , don't mind\ - Dr. Suess " 
My snowflake sock has now lost its counterpart . Why ? My sister flushed it down the toilet . 
family pictures today ... always a joy * hint ... not * 
is exhausted ... \ 
\But I have promises to keep 
well , today is national be a creeper day . I've got this . 
needs the weekend . homework + stress + arguments + guilt + sleep deprivation = long week . 
Working on homework and then going to go tutor with the energy I do not have . I wish bodies were like car batteries ... as long as the car is running , the battery pretty much charges itself . 
For people that are going to Baker , how many of you are actually going to ski or snowboard ? I'm debating on buying a lift ticket ... 
Baker was epic ! It was so nice to take a weekend to unwind and reconcile with friends , with God and with ourselves . 
comfy day = footie pajamas ? I think so ! 
Okay , so what are we supposed to wear for the New Years Spirit Day ? 2011 stuff ? Black and white ( cause that's what people typically wear to New Years parties) ? Thinking about not even bothering to dress up tomorrow ... 
so it's winter break and the first things I do are picking up after my dog and getting on facebook . I hope this isn't commentary on my social life . 
Politically Correct Christmas Carols ? \ 
10 ) O Holiday Tree\ 
9 ) Have Yourself a < PROPFEMALE > Little Day of Winter\ 
8 ) Frosty the Snowperson\ 
7 ) Chestnuts Roasting on a Safely Contained , Continuously Monitored , Eco-friendly , Non-toxic Outdoor Fire ( for Which I Do Have a Permit)\ 
6 ) Higher Power Rest Ye < PROPFEMALE > Gentlemen 
I'm quite sure < PROPMALE > did not teach us what we should know so that we may complete the WebAssign . Again . Joy . 
It's Wednesday ... and Friday < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
This is the best time for a dislike button . So I could dislike all the statuses ( or is it stati ? ) that are talking about the school cancellation . My inner nerd dislikes this greatly and wishes for school . 
So my little cousin has to write about her favorite color . Apparently her favorite color is red and she has \shi**s\ " in that color . I think she meant shirts . But I'm not going to be the one to correct her . Gotta love little kids :) " 
is feeling productive . consdering the pile of homework I must complete before Tuesday , this is a good thing . and I shall put it to good use by refraining from Facebook use . haha , I cannot type the previous sentence with any conviction whatsoever . 
is in a contemplative mood , but it's inspired by creativity . so that's a good thing :) 
tomorrow I begin the composition for spanish that everetto told us NOT to procrastinate until the last day . I didn't procrastinate . I just had other things to do ... like homework for more important classes . should be fun . 
a balanced chemical equation : 2H2 + 2C ? C2H4\ 
two hydrogen gases react with two carbons to form ethylene\ 
this is my family . two seperate elements to form a single compound . a total of four hydrogens ( 1 set of two adults , my mom , dad , and 1 set of two children , me , my sister ) and two carbons ( < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ) react to form one family . \ 
it's weird how chemistry relates to real life * sigh * I'm a nerd . 
Calc kids : What is the integral ( anti-derivative stuff ) homework for this weekend ? A certain idiot ( me ) left their notebook in Chemistry yesterday ... 
\Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass . It's about learning to dance in the rain . \ " - ( don't remember the source ... ACK ! ) " 
The coach decided to sit me out on this one . But even though I'm on the bench , I'm not discouraged . I still have an important job to do . For I've been chosen to support and cheer on the team I've grown to love . 
Long and grueling week joins with a weekend that will be full of homework . Mid-Winter Break , please come faster . 
EVERYONE ( yes you ! ) : go to Joeseppis tonight from 4-8 to support the < PROPFIRST > Vikings Lacrosse team !! 
Got herself a Polaroid camera :) however , there is a small issue . Polaroid discontinued its classic model and the film . Anyone know where I could get my hands on some film ? 
I think I just laughed my way to a six-pack . 
Stealth game + < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > + Dressed as hippies ? = epic . ' Nuff said . 
Being single on < PROPFIRST>'s Day is quite cost effective . 
< PROPMALE > is a fantastic influence for researchers . He introduces a broad science topic , his goldfish asks a narrowed question and he employs many different sources ( various children , babies , TV , email , Mr. Noodle ) , which create a path of inductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion for the aforementioned question . Who knew ? Surely the three-year-olds watching don't . 
in Cannon Beach . Sunrise at 7:05 tomorrow . I don't think I've ever been so stoked for a morning run :D 
finally bought herself Bananagrams . Watch out everyone . The path to world domination has been laid . 
likes being home . 
Coffee with good company is always a pleasure :) 
thoughts on the the first day back at lacrosse ? \ 
goodness , I am so excited for this year . I get to practice and half a dozen people hug me excitedly , glad to see me back . For those of you that fit this description , the sentiments are returned , ten-fold . 
What do you do with epileptic lettuce ? You mix it up in a seizure salad ! Thanks < PROPFIRST > Goetz ( aka Thing 2 ) for your wonderful jokes of the day . They make me smle :D 
Little sis coming through here ...

Into the Woods ? Hmmm , I've only got two words for you . Freaking . Awesome . Way to go cast , stage crew and pit ! If you haven't seen it or don't plan to ... don't be a square . Go . Do . Now . 
Will be sporting her < PROPFIRST > jersey around school tomorrow ! < PROPFIRST > Lady Viks , let's represent !! First game , let's take it by storm ! 
A \W\ " in the stats column ? Yes please !!!! WAY TO GO LADY VIKS ! WE KILLED IT . " 
< PROPFEMALE > , hi this is mom , I love it when you forget to sign out of FB . Then I can post whatever I want !.... 
What is Lent about ? Ask anyone and they will tell you that you remove something you value highly , like television , facebook , chocolate , and every time you have a craving for that thing or find yourself challenged , you turn your attention to God . All in attempt to keep you thinking about the upcoming Easter , when Jesus died on the cross for you . 
Even though my piano is wonderfully tuned and does not cause my ears to bleed , I miss playing at the girls retreat . Something about the people or perhaps the topic of interest made playing much more meaningful . To all the girls ( and leaders ) at BF , you guys are amazing and I am wondefrfully blessed to have you in my life :) 
We are the Vikings . Yeah . We play lacrosse . Yeah . But on the field . Yeah . < PROPFEMALE > Pope is BOSS ! Well done , < PROPFEMALE > , you were nothing short of epic . And to the rest of the girls , you're awesome ! :D :D 
So yesterday , my little four-year-old cousin asked me if pumpkins have emotions . I was inclined to say no , but now that I think about it ... Jack O'Lanterns smile . In an evil , creepy sort of way . So they must be happy ... right ? 
So , typically I don't dream at night because I don't sleep deep enough . But last night , I dreamt . My dream ? I got bit in the neck by a Gila monster . Yeah . I feel cool .
