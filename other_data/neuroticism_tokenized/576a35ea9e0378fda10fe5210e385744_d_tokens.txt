But < PROPMALE > the Panda is still showing poor plate discipline by swinging at some really bad balls out of the strikezone . 
Watching the Giants offense sputter on opening day is PURE TORTURE .... Torture is back ! 
Bad defense + lackluster offense = Loss on Opening Day for the defending World Series Champions . 
< PROPFIRST > Belt , THREE RUN < PROPMALE > !!!!

Anything worth having is worth waiting for .... 
Circumstances do not make a man , they reveal him . 
I thank the Lord for the many blessings He has granted me . 
Sometimes when one becomes so emotionally invested in the mission , they become irrational ....

All able bodied individuals who can attend tomorrow's search party , we need to traverse the more treacherous areas that others were not able to get to . It is imperative we search the tougher terrain . 
Excellent work , Search Party 140 . < PROPMALE > Zhao and < PROPMALE > Ruszak need to be congratulated for the work they put in today . Thank you to < PROPMALE > Klaas and the KlaasKids foundation for providing us the intel necessary to continue the search .

There are things humans can do to one another that are sobering to the soul . \ 
It is one thing to reconcile these things with God , but another to square it with yourself . 
\We will not go quietly into the night ! We will not vanish without a fight ! We're going to live on ! We're going to survive ! Today we celebrate our Independence Day !!!!!!! \"" 
Time to dominate the upcoming midterm .... 
The midterm has been conquered . \ 
Time to conquer the rest of the world . \ 
I am the master of my < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
I control my environment . \ 
I make my life the way I want it . 
On a drive to nowhere ....... Working hard to get my fill , everybody wants a thrill , paying anything to roll the dice , just one more time . Don't stop believing , hold on to that feeling !!!! 
Group presentation , mission accomplished so time to study for midterm #2 . Starting to hit my groove academically but need to get my 20 rep squat workout in between all the study sessions . 
Failure is not falling down , you fail when you don't get back up . Failure is the first step to success . Failure is the stepping stone for success . Fall down seven times , stand up eight .

Massage then off to the gym to work on back and biceps .... 
Out and about in my hometown of San < PROPFIRST > . 
Getting my cardio and tan on in preparation for Vegas next week 
I'm an uncle again ! Welcome to the family , little Cayra !!!! 
Almost en route to Las Vegas .... 
It feels like Apollo 13 in this rental car .... we have to swap this vehicle out with a functioning one the second we find civilization ! 
Living the suite life at the Wynn .... sleep not necessary in Las Vegas ! 
Whatever happens in Vegas is revealed in heaven . 
Getting hit on is always a nice ego boost lol 
8 years ago , I gazed upon the face of an angel , her beauty so pristine , truly the fairest < PROPFEMALE > of them all ....... 
Stumbling around but still extremely coherent .... 
Just randomly saw < PROPMALE > Evans walk by 
Feeling sexy at Tryst and XS .... the night is still young !!!! 
I cannot feel my hamstrings and calves 
Driving on the shoulder to avoid traffic ! We just saved a couple hours thanks to < PROPFIRST > lol ! 
What I'm looking for in a future relationship : mutual respect , teamwork , extreme passion , polarizing attraction and a best friend who will be my partner in crime . \ 
Superficiality , envy and materialism is a NO GO . I've accomplished SO MUCH in my I can afford to be picky now . 
“He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life . ” - Muhammad < PROPFIRST > 
All the years of sacrifice , hard work and dedication have finally paid off . Today is one of the greatest days of my life . Thank you , dear Lord . 
Life is good ! 
Lead , follow , or get out of the way ! 
The past does not equal the future .... 
Once I was blind , but now I see ....... Free , free from my past . 
\Choose a job you love 
Working men's soccer exhibition against < PROPMALE > . Go Gaels ! 
To be great , a solid foundation must first be built .... 
A team , whether athletic , military , or corporate , is only an extension of each other . \ 
Championship moxie is a symbiotic integration of many different processes working in unison to achieve a singular purpose . \ 
ONE TEAM , ONE GOAL .... 
Time to leave the past in my rear view mirror as a < PROPMALE > new chapter of my begins to unfold . 
Victory without sacrifice means nothing . 
Today is a gift .... 
Excellence is a habit . 
Room and board on campus courtesy of the Montgomery G.I. < PROPMALE > is a true blessing . 
Thank you to those who didn't believe in me . That extra chip on my shoulder just carried me to where I was always meant to be .... 
I have found the fountain of youth ....... 
All I ever wanted was an opportunity and now it is time to shine . 
Before I leave my twenties behind , had to make sure I can still deadlift 415 lbs for reps ! 
10 years ago , I made a decision as the World Trade Center towers smoldered like giant , hulking cigarettes . That day I decided to always fight for social justice and for what is right . Never forget what happened 10 years ago .......... Semper Fidelis , Always Faithful . 
I'm shaving off at least a minute on my 3 mile run every time I go out there ! Getting close to my 18 minute bench < PROPFIRST > goal !!!! 
Prepare to succeed ....... 
Got tuxedo fitted at Selix for < PROPFIRST>'s wedding and was shocked when the lady measuring me said that I have a size 30 waist .... I've never had a size 30 waist in my life o_O ! 
3.75 mile run , MISSION ACCOMPLISHED ! 
My immune system is finally at its breaking point . I need some serious rest and rehabilitation right now . 
\Are you envious because I am generous ? \ " \ 
Months of hard grunt work searching allowed us the opportunity to find < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . The darkness that lies within humanity's heart is great but the power of our love and unity made it possible for us to defeat the devil's work . Mission accomplished but the war against injustice and evil tyranny is never over . \ 
Fight on brothers and sisters and never lose faith in the notion that good will always triumph over evil because we did so here every time we went out to look for < PROPFEMALE > . 
Live life to its fullest each day as each day is a gift from above . 
LOVE one another and forgive petty , superficial differences ....... 
Give HOPE to those who have lost it and brighten their life in the face of darkness . Together , impossible tasks can be achieved . 
Unwinding in Tahoe .... 
Time for some \adult entertainment . \ " Go < PROPFIRST > go !!!! " 
Off to the Tahoe north shore .... what a crazy weekend so far ! 
Firearm fun ! 
Some asked , why volunteer so much time to search for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ? I had a simple answer to those people : DUTY TO HUMANITY 
Just went and annihilated the heavy bag in Madigan ! Ready to get back to training !!!! 
Another 3.75 mile run in the books .... OO RAH ! 
Those who undermine my accomplishments have not accomplished a damn thing themselves . Take your haterade and shove it where the sun don't shine . 
Hell has no demon I won't overcome , I made the devil himself turn and run !!!! 
I've been abandoned by family and the women I loved , underestimated , hated on , left to die , ignored and constantly misunderstood . BUT I'M STILL STANDING IN THE PATH OF THE ENEMY LINE WITH MY < PROPFEMALE > IN THE AIR AND MY HEAD HELD HIGH ! \ 
I will never give in to the hate , the superficiality , the materialism and the negativity that permeates society today . 
To those who have themselves a quality significant other and still choose to cheat or treat them poorly , the universe will knock their ass off their selfish , self absorbed perch . \ 
Be grateful for what you have . I learned the hard way . 
Back in the zone .... there is no obstacle too large that will ever get in the way of this run away Diesel Train ! 
I used to run away from my problems and I ran in circles trying to escape an invisible enemy .... now I meet everything head on . 
It just occurred to me that the 49ers are stacked with former 1st round picks with 3 of them from the top 10 in 2005 ( #1 overall QB < PROPFIRST > Smith , #3 WR Braylon Edwards , #9 CB < PROPFIRST > Rogers ) . Hopefully this collection of 1st round talent can coalesce into a playoff contender . 
In a few hours , < PROPFIRST > will be a married man .... congrats brother ! 
It's official .... Frank is a married man . One day I'll find my < PROPFEMALE > and have a beautiful day such as this . 
CLEAN SWEEP FOR THE WEDDING PARTY ! \ 
Bridesmaid Jennalyn Macaraeg caught the bouquet from the new Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > Leou and this groomsman caught the garter from Frank ....... marriage must be written in the stars for us in the near future !!!! 
From Mass today : \Invite to the wedding feast whomever you find . - < PROPFIRST > 22:1 -14\ " \ 
< PROPFIRST > Rodgers is one of my inspirations .... overlook me , under appreciate my skills and I'll make your ass pay for not believing in me and giving me another chip on my shoulder . 
I'm the way I am because I worked for it . \ 
I lacked discipline , so I joined the < PROPFEMALE > Corps and made myself a better human being in the process . \ 
I felt like I needed more education , so I got myself a Master of Fine Arts . \ 
I earned my swag the hard way and nobody can ever take away what I've accomplished !!!! 
If I ever have an extra $ 30,000,000 laying around , I will bring back Saint < PROPFIRST>'s football ! LONG LIVE GAEL FOOTBALL ! 
Doc weighed me at the VA today and was shocked that I'm at 177.5 lbs . I'm no doubt faster , stronger , leaner and smarter so the next moron who calls me old is getting my foot stuck straight up their < PROPFEMALE > ass ! 
I once used to regret my past .... but now I celebrate it as a stepping stone to the man I have become today . \ 
“You can’t connect the dots looking forward ; you can only connect them looking backwards . So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future . You have to trust in something – your gut , < PROPFEMALE > , life , < PROPFEMALE > , whatever . Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path ; and that will make all the difference . ” - < PROPMALE > Jobs\ 
My past led me to the current path that I walk now . 
Today , I take my life back . Today , I get out of my own way . Today , I stop masking my fears with arrogance . Today , I become the man I was always meant to be . 
QUICK SLANT TO DELANIE < PROPMALE > ! 
Back in 2005 , < PROPFIRST > Smith was drafted by the San < PROPFIRST > 49ers number one overall . At 20 years old , he was handed the keys to the 49er franchise but did not perform . One can ask , how can someone with so much talent and so much going for him fail miserably ? \ 
Easy answer now : he was force fed terrible coaching for years but in came < PROPMALE > Harbaugh and pointed him in the right direction . \ 
The 49ers now stand 5-1 going into their bye week with all the momentum in the world as their efficient quarterback becomes more and more comfortable each week . Success breeds confidence and < PROPFIRST > Smith's plight from failed number one pick to the quarterback he is now is inspirational . 
Back to basics and fundamentals .... 
Can't be touched , \ 
Can't be stopped , \ 
Can't be moved , \ 
Can't be rocked , \ 
Can't be shook ....... 
When you strive to separate yourself from the rest of the crowd , the jealous crabs will try to claw you back down to their level as you rise above them . Never give in to the hate because the fact alone that you bust your ass and work harder than them makes you a CHAMPION . \ 
Those crabs will never have the heart , drive and determination to leave the pack so let them wallow in their own misery . 
EARTHQUAKE !!!! 
So many times , it happens too fast\ 
You change your passion for glory\ 
Don’t lose your grip on the dreams of the past\ 
You must fight just to keep them alive ....... 
\You will win success at whatever you attempt . \ " Thank you fortune cookie for giving me more fuel for my < PROPFEMALE >!" 
Beaten , why for ? \ 
Can't take much more .... \ 
One , nothing wrong with me .... \ 
Two , nothing wrong with me .... \ 
Three , nothing wrong with me .... \ 
Four , nothing wrong with me .... \ 
One , something's got to give .... \ 
Two , something's got to give .... \ 
Three , something's got to give ....... 
Woke up to an earthquake at 6 something in the morning .... thought it was a damn dream ! 
Let's go Texas Rangers ! \ 
It was our time last year so bring your first World Series title back home to Arlington ! 
The Rangers with a total choke job . They simply blew it .... don't expect them to win it tomorrow . The Cardinals have all the momentum now . \ 
I had flashbacks of the 2002 World Series when the Giants choked game 6 to the Anaheim Angels in the final innings ! Looks like the old Giants ' curse is with the Texas Rangers now . 
Congratulations to the St. < PROPFIRST > Cardinals .... they earned it . 
Sometimes a person must give up instant gratification for the security of their future . 
The giant monkey on my back has finally been banished to oblivion .... 
The San < PROPFIRST > Giants won the World Series exactly one year ago .... don't stop believing ! 
Seems like I always get sick after getting a flu shot .... this congestion needs to end NOW ! Thank you sickness for taking out my Halloween weekend but at least I got a lot of studying in for all my exams this week ! 
Victory is MINE and to the < PROPFIRST > go the spoils .... 
Valor is the strength not of legs and arms , but of heart and soul . 
Peyton Hillis re-injures his hamstring ? The Madden Curse strikes once again ! 
\I will always believe greatness comes from having people come together for a common cause . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Lott " 
The San < PROPFIRST > 49ers are 7-1 for the first time since 1997 !!!!
