Words are a confusing thing , when they free you they also trap you , no matter how much you open up they still bind you down and they can even drag other people down with you . At the same time I couldn't live without them . That form of expression , no matter how much it may hurt at times , gives us life . 
took this photo freshman year , haven't changed that much have i ? 
Later .

old nursery rhyme said Thursday's child has far to go and i was told it means we have to try harder then everyone else , but could that be taken to say we have the greatest potential ? / ?

I want to send you all family requests and say CUZZIN !!! 
my new favorite quote : That's so cute it's stupid .
