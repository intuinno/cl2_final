hates lighters that stop working even though there's still a bunch of fluid left ! 
leave me to myself . 
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade . 
-wish Heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today , but that is nothing new .. I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , from which I'll never part . God has you in his arms , & I have you in my heart ..... Repost if you have someone in Heaven . ?

Sometimes we need to stop analyzing the past , stop planning the future , stop figuring out precisely how we feel , stop deciding with our minds exactly what we want our hearts to feel , sometimes we just have to go with the flow and just enjoy life .

How did we meet ? *** copy this to your status and see what stories you get ! *** 
If somebody don't like you . . . remember its mind over matter , You shouldn't MIND because they DON'T MATTER . 
At some point , you have to make a decision . Boundaries don't keep\ 
people out , they fence you in . Life is messy . That's how we're made . So you\ 
can waste your life drawing lines or you can live your life crossing them . 
woohoo it's the weekend ! getting ready for work ! 
It is pretty amazing when you really , truly realize that the joy you have in life is all yours to create . :)

won't let go of anything i hold . 
The love we have is God's gift to us , what we do with it is our gift to God . 
We live in a crazy world , and if you want to get through it with your body and soul even a little bit intact , you might as well be crazy yourself . It couldn't hurt , and it just might help . & hearts ;

Happiness is not a possession to be prized , it is a quality of thought , a state of mind . 
I happen to believe the world will change only when we change ourselves . And that starts with finding ourselves . And that starts with listening to ourselves : learning to quiet the clamor in our minds and the voices of everyone around us and move toward what feels right- towards the things we know , for reasons we can’t explain , that we’re meant to do , the things that make us feel alive . 
I have no right , by anything I do or say , to demean a human being in his own eyes . What matters is not what I think of him ; it is what he thinks of himself . To undermine a man’s self-respect is a sin . 
the heart has its reasons , of which the mind knows nothing . 
Good doesn’t exist without evil . Good wouldn’t have a meaning , if we never knew what bad was . Success doesn’t exist without failures . We’d have nothing to succeed at , if we didn’t fail at anything . Love doesn’t exist without struggle . There would be no reason to love , if we didn’t struggle so much for how much it was worth it in the end . 
happy new years < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ryone ! gettin the fireworks gonna bbq it up and < PROPFEMALE > rythang !! :)

It’s about being unselfishly devoted and committed with that special person till the LAST BEAT of your heart . <3
