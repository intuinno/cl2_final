I had great weekend with friends and < PROPFEMALE > . The movie , “Pray the Devil Back to Hell” was great . I recommend it to everyone . It is a very moving portrayal of the obstacles and later triumph of the Liberian women . Such a powerful statement for why it makes sense to invest in women and continue to fight for women’s rights everywhere . 

My travels were great . I met new people ; saw new stuff ; and had new experiences . You know I always love all of the above . Will put Pics up soon . 
CALM DOWN people , the Health care package did not go as far as it should have , but it is a GOOD THING . STOP listening to the HATE mongers and read the FACTS .
