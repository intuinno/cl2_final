Testifying at a Murder civil suit today . Wish me luck 

Three hours testifying but I survived 
Spent 5 hours at the beach . The Gulf Temp was 88 degrees ... bath water 
Already has had five work related calls . Don't they understand this is a National holiday ? 
Messed up my calf running tonight . Heard a pop . Can't put any weight on my leg . Time for R.I.C.E. ( rum on ice , crying and expletives ) 
Doc says I blew out a valve in my leg . sent me for tests . I'm afraid that I have a blood clot . Will know more tomorrow 
I don't remember yesterday . What happened 20 freakin years ago ? 
Waverly High Grads ... Please take lots of pics Saturday and post them for those of us that wish we could be joining you 
Early gym workout , walk on the beach with a large coffee , relaxing in the sun for a few hours , home for an afternoon nap and tonight bowling/drinking with friends . What a great way to spend a day off ! 
For those if us who HATE the new FB ... go to the left side of the News feed , and click ' More ' and drag the ' Status Updates ' icon thing to the top of the list . Then press the ' Less ' button . Refresh the < PROPFEMALE > and it goes back to normal ( cut and pasted from < PROPFEMALE>'s profile ... Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ) 
Sorry facebook friends . I have been absent from here for a few weeks . A busy time at work and PC problems have curtailed my FB experiance . 
Alcohol increases my tolerance for visiting family members .... barely . Wish I was bringing in the New Year with my chosen family ( friends ) HAPPY NEW YEAR everyone 
Family is gone finally , now to put on the Hazmat suit and begin clean-up 
I believe us Floridians made a pact with the devil when Ponce De < PROPFIRST > arrived looking for the fountain of youth . Because of that pact ... Florida has the highest population of elderly thus giving us snow in the panhandle ( I'm sure < PROPFIRST > Robertson would agree ) 
It's movie line week here on Facebook . Cut and paste this to your status and in the comment box write your favorite line from a movie and see how many people know the movie and the lines ! Don't forget to comment on your friends movie lines .

Going to < PROPFIRST>'s for an adult beverage ( or two ) 
Discovered margaritas , sushi and sake don't mix 
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen\ 
Were ever real , were ever really happening 
< PROPFEMALE > , if you don't tell me what's on your mind , I'm afraid I'll have to smother you with a pillow \." 
A USA military member is missing their \

Military member or appreciate the Military . 
And like a blind dog without a bone\ 
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone\ 
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold 
Thanks to family and friends that sent me these pics . I needed the smile today 
Friends ... I'll be away until Sunday . Go out and enjoy this Holiday weekend !

Ummmmm ... has anyone seen my cell phone ? 
Not to be ungrateful ... I'm just wondering why all my friend suggestions ( for the last couple weeks ) are for drag queens ? 
Watched as a 1968 Camaro pulled up to a 2010 Camaro at a red light . Both drivers glared at the other , both engines roared . The drivers saluted each other and peacefully drove off . AHHHH ... In the jungle , the mighty jungle\ 
The lion sleeps tonight 
Father's Day is approaching . Yellow roses grow in heaven , Lord pick a \ 
bunch for me . Place them in my father's arms and tell him they're from \ 
me . Tell him that I love and miss him . When he turns to smile place a \ 
kiss upon his cheek and hold him for awhile , because remembering him is \ 
easy , I do it every day . There's an ache in my heart ......... that will \ 
never go away . If your Dad is in Heaven , copy and post 
Is anyone else planning on checking out N . Pinellas Pride this Saturday in Dunedin ?

Rest in peace < PROPFIRST > . I was blessed to be part of your close friends and family and will forever be grateful for all you taught me through the years . I love you and miss you

Older people hide their behaviors . Older people think that young people cannot see . Yet young people see everything . The young people are destroying your way of life . The young people have always done that . Your job is to encourage it , not discourage it . - Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch

What do you do if your Ex is limping around and bleeding in you're back yard ??? \ 
Take a deep breath , focus , reload , and shoot again !!! 
Just ran flatwoods trail and decided to take the bike trail . I ran past a young doe and buck ... three feet off the trail . They just stopped and watched me run by . What a wonderful gift 
We have children going to bed without eating . Elderly going without neededmedicines . Mentally ill without treatment . Troops without proper equipment . Yet we donate millions to other countries before helping our own first !! 99% of people on facebook won't have the guts to copy and .. repost this ...!!! WILL YOU ?? .... DAMN Right I Will . 
Everyone in this town drives like they're 96 years old . FRUSTRATING 
Back home after a week away for work . Now to deal with this kidney stone . Let the screaming begin 
On my way to Tampa General to finally get rid of this kidney stone . Have a great weekend everyone ! 
\Gotta level with ya ... Glee club was for dorks\ " LOL " 
No Bingo for me at Hamburger < PROPFIRST>'s tonight . It's a < PROPFIRST>'s baseball night . See you at the ballpark 
A politician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension is not reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expense account ; a soldier must justify extra rations . A politician vows to defend their country ; a soldier actually keeps that promise . REPOST SUPPORT OUR TROOPS to hell with the politician ! 
Working in South Florida today and all weekend . Will not have my laptop . I hope everyone enjoys their weekend 
I love you Starbucks pumpkin scone . My life is now complete 
Trying to experience a bowling tournament vicariously through FB . Come on guys .... speak to me ... How are you doing ? 
10/10/10 . Dad passed away 15 years ago but today was his birthday . Happy Birthday Dad !! Not a day goes by where I don't think about you and miss you 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice - People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 
I somehow lost five friends from my friend's list today . I don't know who they are yet but it makes me wonder if they disagreed with the color purple . I sure hope not 
FRUSTRATING ! 
Maybe it's just me , but up until the recent spate of news articles on the issue , I had no idea there were straight people in the military . 
My refrigerator decided to die and leave me another mess on the floor last night BUT ... Tonight is All Hallows Masquerade Ball ... SO EXCITED ! 
A big THANKS to < PROPFIRST > Kizer and < PROPFIRST > Cavallo for the Halloween costume help . It was a BIG hit . I owe you 
You expect me to pay to ride this filthy contraption ? Have you the brain worms ? 
i may hate my life at times but i always try to live 
The sword of time will pierce our skins \ 
It doesn't hurt when it begins \ 
But as it works its way on in \ 
The pain grows stronger ... watch it grin

We are asking everyone to say a prayer for \Darkhorse\ " 3rd Battalion 5th Marines and their families . They are fighting it out in Afghanistan and have lost 9 marines in 4 days . Please re-post this to show your support of our troops . " 
Beautiful \top down\ " weather in Tampa today " 
A Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to and including their life . That is beyond honor and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste if you're a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love ... a Veteran or support the Troops ! Thanks for the sacrifice made to this country ! 
When I grow up ... I want to be like me ... only younger ! 
Cousins are the 1st friends of your life . When you grow up , they are still your friends . Cousins are there as childhood friends and when we are older as forever friends ... No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins . Repost this if u have some of the best cousins in the world !! 
Friends from out of town showing up on my doorstep and staying through Thanksgiving . How .... Unexpected 
On my way with my house guests to a totally straight club to dance . Why do I feel uneasy about this ?

So let me get this straight ... < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is on his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with everyone ; and yet the idea of same-sex marriage is still going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? 
It may sound weird but I'm looking forward to the garden tub , hot bath , bath bomb , candles , music , glass of wine ... dont judge

Thanks < PROPFIRST > Kizer you really did make this phone more amazing . I hope you and < PROPFIRST > Cavallo have a wonderful holiday 
New phone + celebrating 2 recently deceased friends by drinking enough for all three of us + texting , emailing and calling = awkward and embarassing . This is the season for forgiveness ... soooooo , I'm sorry ( to anyone I may have offended )

YAY ! I have family visiting through New Years . Now ... where did put that damn xanax

Death row last minute pardon ... I have my job 30 more days until lay-off ( hey .. every paycheck counts ) 
I was just dropped as a friend and blocked for the first time ever !!!! Do I get a badge for that ? 
Per Mama at the Reservoir Bar .... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy .... Re-post if you agree ... \

Eight years of being single I now remember what I miss in a relationship ( thanks a hell of a lot < PROPFIRST > Kizer and < PROPFIRST > Cavallo ... If I didn't love ya so much , I would HATE you ) :) 
There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are . They have the gift of kindness or courage or loyalty or integrity . It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family . They teach the truth by living 
LAME ... let my pity party begin

Difficult decision this week . LA job is calling . If I accept it my life will either be put on hold for two years or , it will grow . Friendships will either be enhanced , lost or worse ... destroyed . My brain and my heart do not agree .... what to do ??? 
In an attempt to be honest and open I have the ability to come off sounding like a complete asshole concerned about only my own welfare . Sorry guys 
In an attempt to be honest and open I have the ability to come off sounding like a complete asshole concerned about only my own welfare . Sorry < PROPFIRST > Kizer and < PROPFIRST > Cavallo ( this is a seperate post that only you two can see ) . I will NOT abandon you

So .... \ 
the US Supreme Court has ruled that you have the right under the First\ 
Amendment to protest military funerals ... I invite you to start your\ 
protest in my front yard and we can see if your first amendment is\

In honor of MS awareness week , March 7th-13th , 2011 , I am asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you love has Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . I know my friends will . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found and more awareness for CCSVI . Do it in the memory and the honor of those fighting MS . 
Date night ... stood up . again . Fuck you Tampa 
I'm on a roll . I had a friend coming over this afternoon and he bagged me too . Let me re-state what I said last night .... TAMPA SUCKS !!!! 
The difference between an ordinary and a loyal friend is the support and care they provide . True and loyal friends will always stand by your side and they will ultimately provide you what you need in any circumstance . They won’t ask for a payback even if they do a lot . 
If all of my friends were to jump off a bridge , I would not follow . I would be at the bottom to catch them when they fall ~ unknown author ~

I just figured it out . No one has my back . Apparently I'm in this alone . Definately changes the way I think and will do things in the future 
Never make someone a priority , when all u are is an option ( thanks < PROPFIRST > for reminding me of this truth ) 
Feeling used and taken advantage of this morning . NOT a good way to start the day 
It has been inferred by a friends post that I don't appreciate the value of friendship or worse ... not a good friend . Please offer your thoughts 
I think I just reached a new spiritual plane today , I just had a Buddhist Monk flip me off . 
Been awake 41 straight hours now . Finally tired . Good night friends 
Left arm and hand are not cooperating ( and for the many sick and twisted friends i have and adore ... \not in that way\ " .... lol ) " 
I discovered that mixing oxycontin for an injured hand , weed and Beer may not be a good combo . Not saying it was me .... just saying I read that somewhere 
If you have a sister who has made you laugh .. Stuck up for you .. Drove you crazy .. Got mad at you .. Made up with u .. Hugged you .. Watched you succeed .. Saw you fall .. Picked you back up .. Cheered you on .. Made you strong .. and you can't do without .. Paste this to your status . 
Decided to stay home tonight ... a friends friend shared something pretty deep . I need to ponder . 
Kinda weird ... I'm excited about seeing < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > /Stevie Nicks concert tomorrow with < PROPFIRST > D . < PROPMALE > . Not that I don't enjoy < PROPFIRST>'s company but was never really a < PROPMALE > fan 
Okay universe .. I get it . You do not want me to have any money right now . Since I now understand ... please cut me some slack .... FML 
Even though I have been complaining recently about how the Universe has been treating me , I must thank the Universe for giving me the best roommates I have ever had ( and possibly friends ) . < PROPFIRST > Kizer and < PROPFIRST > Cavallo you have once again helped me deal with a difficult day . Your wisdom , generousity and compassion goes way beyond your earthly years . I LOVE you guys ! 
As a young teen I adoored < PROPFIRST > Nicks and did not like < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Tonight .. < PROPFIRST > sounded great but < PROPMALE > was INCREDIBLE ! Thanks < PROPFIRST > D . NewtonPatrick Obrien , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > for making it special .

65 year old co-worker falls dead in my office today from a heart attack . I gave CPR for the 9th time in my life . I'm 0 for 8 going into today . Let's hope I'm 1 for 9 in the morning 
Awake ... awake ... awake ... awake

Poop in pool = Party over 
Thanks < PROPFIRST > D . < PROPMALE > . The burgers and company last night highlighted a good weekend ! 
Had to check the mirror to make sure I didn't have \STUPID\ " tattooed on my forehead " 
Magic brownies should not taste like weed . Find a new recipe .... just saying 
Don't like this tension 
I now understand that I don't understand ( life , love , relationships , etc ) 
I should not have done that 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > at the pool , playing the sax to chicago . What a perfect morning 
Whenever I feel blue , I start breathing again . 
Why is it the one night that you really need to get some sleep , someone or something keeps you awake all night . Oh well .. an early start to a 24 hour work day .... FML , FML , FML 
Heading to Flamingo Resort for some sun , fun , and food . If any friends are in the area , stop in and say \hi \"" 
Had to leave Flamingo earlier than expected . Thank you Flamingo staff for your kindness :))) 
Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it , and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's Depression Awareness Week and 1 in 5 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support . I copied and pasted , will you ? 
Bin Laden killed and already buried at sea ? 
Do not confuse me being polite and kindness with weakness ... big mistake 
Cannot believe my day . I get in a fight with a vagrant , I get served papers that I'm being sued and ... I just slipped and fell on some shampoo at wal-mart . 3 hour drive home ... hope my luck holds out 
Starting to have second thoughts . I need universal guidance 
I refuse to believe they really don't care 
Thanks for your hospitality tonight < PROPFEMALE > . Even though I may not agree with your advice you have given me lots to think about . Love ya ! 
Hold the phones ... we may have passed the first test
