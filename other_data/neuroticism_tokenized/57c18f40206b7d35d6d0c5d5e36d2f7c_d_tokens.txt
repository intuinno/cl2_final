That girl you just called fat ? She is overdosing on diet pills . That girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . That boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . That man with the ugly scars ? He fought for our country . That guy you just made fun of for crying ? His mother is dying .

I have a headache . 
I died today ! You got tired of me and took me to the shelter . They were overcrowded and I < PROPFIRST > an unlucky number . I am in a black plastic bag in a landfill now . Some other puppy will get the barely used leash you left . My collar was dirty and too small , but the lady took it off before she sent me to the Rainbow Bridge . Would I still be at home if I hadn’t chewed your shoe ? I didn’t know what it was , but it was leather , and it was on the floor . I was just playing . You forgot to get puppy toys . Would I still be at home if I had been housebroken ? Rubbing my nose in what I did only made me ashamed that I had to go at all . There are books and obedience teachers that would have taught you how to teach me to go to the door . Would I still be at home if I hadn’t brought fleas into the house ? Without anti-flea medicine , I couldn’t get them off of me after you left me in the yard for days . Would I still be at home if I hadn’t barked ? I was only saying , “I’m scared , I’m lonely , I’m here , I’m here ! I want to be your best friend . ” Would I still be at home if I had made you happy ? Hitting me didn’t make me learn how . Would I still be at home if you had taken the time to care for me and to teach manners to me ? You didn’t pay attention to me after the first week or so , but I spent all my time waiting for you to love me . I died today very lonely . Love , Your Puppy Please forward this to everyone , its time to STOP animal abuse !!! Copy and paste if your against animal abuse !....

Lesly , I miss finding you where ever I go , and your nervous laugh when I do . And < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Valles , I wish you were closer . =[ I miss how I can make you believe anything , and how you are just always so nice . =] 
I love how people at airports are just so smart . Not . I feel like they should have more qualified people to run a airport . 
So I like how my laptop doesn't work when I get home . Just another reason to hate being here . 
I was about to take a shower and a big spider crawled under the door , I swear it had to duck . I am lucky to be alive . 
Movies make me mad . -_- 
This hits close to home . It's hard to explain to someone who has no clue . It's a daily struggle being in pain or feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside . Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has an invisible illness ( PTSD , Anxiety , Bipolar , Depression , Diabetes , LUPUS , Fibromyalgia , MS , ME , Arthritis , Cancer , Heart Disease , Epilepsy , Autism , M.D. etc . ) never judge what you don't understand
