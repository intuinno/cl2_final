Happy summer ! 
officially withdraws all comments of an emotional nature . If you do not know why I do this , do not question my actions , they were not directed at you . 
\The mind is not a \ 
my profile pic is ugly :/ 
Was looking through what I * thought * was a list of < PROPFEMALE > Trek cons . It wasn't . It was a list of TWILIGHT CONVENTIONS ! Imagine my surprise when , in stead of pics of the USS Enterprise , clicking on a link gets me shirtless pics of < PROPMALE > Pattinson . Shudder . 
Wouldn't it be cool if there was Day Glo hair dye ? 
Was really bored and made a Neopets account just because I can . 
has decided that in her < PROPFEMALE > , The Speed of Light , the Schniederman family ( that's Cmdr . < PROPFIRST>'s family ) has a pet iguana named Izzy , which knows how to use the food dispenser and likes to eat cheese .

In stead of translating our thoughts to words , wouldn't it be great if we could simply transfer ideas directly ? Imagine the impact on diplomacy ... or semantics ...

I'm sad . Everyone's in some camp or other but me :( Oh well . I have CTY to look forward to :D 
Why does everyone think Neopets is dumb ? It's surprisingly fun . 
My browser won't let me close any tabs . That's gonna be a problem . 
I know I just had a status update , but you know what ? I just realized something , and I wanna say it on Facebook ! MY LIFE HAS MEANING AGAIN !

Like this status if you want me to make a caricature of you 
I want to post something meaningful about CTY , but nothing seems adequate . I've learned so many things ( both in and out of class ) , made so many friends , but there aren't any words that describe it well ; everything I write sounds corny and stupid . When I look back at the memories they seem colored with emotion , like a yellowed photograph . I can't write more than this , FB has a char limit . Damn .

Just bought a < PROPFEMALE > Trek lunchbox . That makes me so happy . 
¡Pod ! and iPod ! look exactly the same 
I know FB Blammo hasn't spoon started yet , but I'm going to take necessary precautions anyway , in case it starts without me realizing it ... 
Just got a new kitten . I think while she was messing with my laptop she accidentally turned the apostrophe/quote key into a dead key . Oh noez . 
My stupid landline ( which is stupid ! ) just < PROPMALE > up on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > while I was talking to her . >.< No one call me from my landline anymore , it's done this before and I'm sick of it . If you don't have my cell number message me . < PROPFEMALE > , please don't be mad :( Not my fault ! 
Well , it's official . My new < PROPFEMALE > is a hacker . She managed to lock me out of my computer , and I have no idea how . :| 
Bring on the Blammo ! Spoon ! 
Oh great my spoon hacker cat's done it again , my apostrophe is a dead key again . >.< 
I meant to type something into Google . I accidentally typed \spoon\ " instead . Hooray for sleep deprivation . " 
I keep spoon hearing the little pop for facebook chat and thinking someone is chatting with me ... but then facebook isn't even open ... 
hates when people have 6 other people in their profile pics . ( Which one is them ??? ) 
I got blammo'd :'( 
You're waiting for a train . A train that will take you far away . You \

it doesn't matter because we'll be together . 
Aww , yesterdays Google < PROPFEMALE > was so much better ... :( 
My cat did the creepiest thing earlier this morning . She suddenly looked up towards the hall , slowly crept in that direction , stopped , and suddenly all the hair on her back and tail stood on end and she started to back away , then ran and hid under a chair . When I went in the hall , nothing was there , but I got a really eerie feeling . I don't believe in ghosts , never have . I have no idea what could have caused this . 
Damn , people suck more than I thought . There isn't much hope for humanity , is there .

In other news , I went out to the mall today and bought new boots , two necklaces , and some earrings . The boots are . So . Awesome . They're my new favorite things . 
I have been searching , but for what I do not know . \ 
I want to run away , but I don't know where to go . \ 
Adding is easy , but dividing is hard . 
Auditioned for the school play . I think it went well . 
Got into drama ! And got a fairly significant-ish part in the play ! So happy ! 
Today a lady told me I look like Juno . The one in the movie where she gets pregnant . Is that a compliment or not ?

Had a crappy day . 
According to teh internets , Doctor Who fans are now called Whovians . The question is , or rather , three questions are , \ 
1 . What do you call a < PROPFEMALE > Wars fan ? \ 
2 . What do you call a < PROPFEMALE > gate fan ? \ 
3 . For the last time , is it Trekkie or Trekker ?

Hey if anyone had the history homework it'd be great if you could post it . 
It's the little things . 
Was just at her first afterschool drama rehersal . It was super fun . 
I have so many friends that I'm friends with on facebook , and yet I've lost touch with a lot of them anyway . Quite sad . 
Like this if you like the Death Cab 
( Insert inspiring song lyric here ) 
A lot of things . 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice , people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ? Promote LOVE & Acceptance ! —not hate ! 
Saw my first episode of Law and Order : UK . Its little different than its American counterparts , it's more emotional . I think I like it . 
On my way to my last photoshop class . 
Sorrow drips into a your hear through a pinhole , just like a faucet that leaks , and there is comfort in the sound . But while you debate half empty or half full 
Why is Facebook for Android so derpy ? 
HOLY **** ON A **** SANDWICH WITH **** ON TOP AND A SIDE HELPING OF **** . I just had the most amazing but unhealthy sandwich in the world , bacon with chicken cooked in bacon fat and barbecue sauce . I can feel my arteries closing up already . 
I LOSE . 
I had a dream yesterday , and I realized something important , but I forgot what it was . Something about time or reality or life , something deep and philosophical . In the dream I was flying . It was day and night at the same time . When you looked down , there was light on all the houses , but when you looked up , you could see the milky way . I was talking to someone also , he told me something ... I forgot what . 
I turned on the TV and BBC was on , and my mom thought the show that was on was Doctor Who . It was Being Human . She thought that < PROPFIRST > was the Doctor . 
The present is the past of the future . 
Aviary just tweeted about one of my creations ! :D 
Does anyone know if there was homework assigned while I was out ? Sick with a stomach thing . Not fun . Probably something I ate , so I'll probably be back on weds 
Haven't written anything new for the < PROPFIRST > project in ages ... 
Bored . I think I've finally seen all of the episodes of TNG at least twice . 
You know that feeling , that you're exactly where you belong , you've finally achieved all the goals you could possibly have , and you're the best that you could be ? Me neither . 
Wouldn't the Angry Birds theme sound really cool done in a theremin ? Well , anything sounds cool with a theremin , but still .

I had a dream about CTY last night . Everyone was there . ( also < PROPFEMALE > Butensky was there for some reason ) It made me so sad when I woke up . :'( 
Bought a pocket watch . Why ? Because I can . 
I've been wiring up a few of the props for the play . The headset now looks sufficiently evil . Now , to perfect the remote control . 
You know it's typecasting when your costume looks exactly the same as your street clothes . 
Got an ink pen and some nibs and some < PROPFEMALE > ink . Plan on inking my drawings now . :) 
If Mew ( the Pokémon in my profile pic ) had a symbol , it would be µ . Cuz he's just that awesome . Yeah . Also , the game . 
Dammit . Nosebleeds suck . Well , actually , they drip . 
Many things to do . \ 
Wasting time on pointless fluff . \ 
There's something missing .
