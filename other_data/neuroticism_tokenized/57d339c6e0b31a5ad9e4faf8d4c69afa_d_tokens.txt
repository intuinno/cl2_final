Ringing in the New Year while drinking for free at Palms ! Enjoying our last few days in Vegas . Gonna be crazy not living down the street from the biggest adult playground in the world . 

Woke up ... turned my TV on ... it was on a Jersey Shore marathon ... these people are idiots ... and I can't stop watching ... I hate myself a little right now . 
Finally got on the FACEBOOK bus . Need some face pics . 
I love my life . =) 
Another lazy late night . Love it ! 
Off to work . 
Trying to have a relaxed night at home . Not working too well . 
Your values is a disarray prioritizin ' horribly . Unhappy with the riches ' cause you're piss poor morally . Ignorin ' all prior advice and forewarnin , and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden , aren't we ? 
\Dose < PROPFIRST > Merriman gotta choke a bitch ?!? \ " Idiot . " 
Raider's D looked good . =) Jamarcus < PROPFIRST > still sucks . =( Either way , good game . 
I can't stand < PROPMALE > Mayweather Jr. He talks so much shit about MMA , then weighs in two pounds over-weight for his fight tomorrow . I hope he fights Pacquiao soon and gets his ass whooped . 
For those of you who don't already know , here's my plans . Moving back to The Bay in < PROPFIRST > . with < PROPFIRST > for about a year , then to LA around Dec . 2010 . Can't wait to see my friends and family in The Bay . To my So Cal friends , < PROPFIRST > and I will be down there soon enough . Vegas has been incredible but we're ready to move on . Still got a few months out here though . Who's gonna come party with us in the mean time ? 
One of the expos at Yard House was putting the tomato bisque away last night and I saw that he was about to drop it . I was getting ready to point and laugh at him then the tomato bisque hit the ground and splashed all over me . Insta-Karma . 
3 am , wide awake . This sucks . 
Is it January yet ? 
So , I am just getting over my hangover from last night . Long night ... longer day after ... Had a great time though ! 
In an incredibly selfish way we are all sad and depressed that you are no longer with us . With that being said , I am so happy that you get to see your boys again and that you have no more pain . Tell everyone we love and miss them . Rest in peace Aunt < PROPFEMALE > . 
Dis-likes the new facebook layout . 
Fedor . Unbelievable . 
Hope Couture gets back on the winning track and Pacquiao handles business . Great night for fighting !!! 
Both < PROPFIRST > and myself are really , really sick . Was in a lot of pain . The biggest upside ? Laying in bed with my beautiful GF and our incredible dog while we get better . Things are looking up already . 
So much change is coming , which will lead me to so much familiar coming back into my life , which I hope leads to more changes and many steps forward . It's a giant oxymoron , and I love it ! Can't wait to see how the next three months play out . 
Just watched \Notorious\ " again . Hurts every time . " 
It was empty . Only about 1/4 of the shops were open , and it's actually really small , but the architecture and designs were pretty sick . 
New Years can't come soon enough . 
Our last sunday night at Body English before they shut down . =( Guess they found out we were moving and just decided to pack it in . lol Wish we could take Hard Rock with us when we move . 
Can't stand < PROPMALE > Mayweather Jr. He's scared to fight someone that may be able to beat him so he is looking for a way out . I hope this fight happens . I've been wanting to see Pacquiao knock him around for a while now . 
Here's to hoping that working late on New Years < PROPFEMALE > is a sign that big $$$ will be coming my way in 2011 ! Happy New Years everyone !!! 
UFC was sick tonight ! 
Vegas ... Great place to Visit . I'm going , going , back , back , to Cali , Cali !!!

I got Carwin by KO . 
Being sick and having to go to work on the 4th of July sucks ! Really missing San < PROPMALE > right now . Everyone have fun and be safe today/tonight !!! Have a drink for me . 
Anyone else think the Old Spice guy is gay ? 
Sonnen talking shit about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu : \I'm not laying under another man with my legs spread ... I'm a republican we don't do that . \ " . Tonight Sonnen gets submitted for the 7th time . bet he wishes he trained more Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu now . " 
Drinking at Yard House in Long Beach . Pretty amazing right now . 
Carnival cruise for 7 days !!! 
Home from the cruise and I'm pretty sure I'm going be < PROPMALE > over for another day or two . Totally worth it though ! 
RIP 2Pac . died 14 years ago today . damn I feel old .

Wine tasting in Livermore ! 
Your the cutest thing I ever did see ... 
I really love your peaches , wanna shake your tree ... 
Laying in bed with my girl . End to a great weekend ! Going back to school tomorrow for the first time in almost three years !!! Ready for the next chapter . 
About to see Social Network . It only seemed right that I posted that on facebook . 
Okay girls . The bra color thing last year was creative and kinda cool because it had to do with breast cancer awareness . The purse thing ... not so much . Guys will typically just think a dirty though , then forget about it a couple seconds later . That's it . 
Third week of school and 8am isn't getting any easier . 
:/ 
Yeah < PROPMALE > !!! Bad night just keeps getting better ! Found an awesome new bar and THE GIANTS ARE IN THE WORLD SERIES !!!!!!!!!!! 
Slappin da bass . 
< PROPMALE > smashed yesterday , 49ers won , Raiders battered the Seahawks , Giants shut out the Rangers and are one win away from winning the World Series ... Great day to be living in The Bay Area ! 
FUCKING GIANTS BABY !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Alright , let's get it going ! 
Vegas bitches ! 
When we drink we do it right get SLIZZARD !!! 
FML right now , and I still have two more nights here . lol 
Great weekend , but ready to get home . 
Just landed back in The Bay . Still hat flying . 
Alright Mayweather , time to man up . Enough of the excuses , take the fight . PAC MAN !!! 
Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework , Homework ... and the 49ers game playing in the background . 
Crazy next few weeks . Here we go ... 
Hearing a new Dr. Dre song on the radio for the first time in 10 years makes me happy . =) 
Tired and not ready to start all over again tomorrow . FML for a little while longer . 
Say what you want about Kanye being an ass hole , but dude knows how to make music . New album is pretty damn good . 
Change your default facebook picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on facebook until Monday the 6th of Dec . Join the fight against child abuse , and invite your friends to do the same : ) 
Stuck in a funk . Need to clear my head . 
In GSP I trust . 
GSP BABY !!!!!!!!!! 
Dislikes the new facebook layout . 
Go < PROPMALE > ! 
Didn't work out for two months during the holidays . Now back to the gym . Gotta work off this winter coat ! 
2nd week of class this quarter and I'm already saying fml . It's gonna be a long three months . 
\I search but never find 
Perfect high five ? Watch the elbows ( even when you're drunk ) . 
This school quarter is seriously getting in the way of me making to the gym ... 
Fuck school right now . Not really , just my Typography class and my teacher who takes this idiotic subject way too seriously . \ 
\ 
It's okay though . The next week and a half should be awesome for < PROPFIRST > and I . Trying to stay focused on the positive and keep a smile on my face . 
I got < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and Jones . 
In honor of my oldest friends birthday today , I would like to tell everyone to have a DA-LITE-ful day ! Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > ! 
Is annoyed that the Grammy's is advertising that Dr. Dre is performing with Eminem . Would have been a cool surprise . Side note , < PROPMALE > Mars ' and Muse's performances were sick ! Commercial , back to homework ...

Right now ... school can go f**k itself . I have one class I want to focus on and the other ones are just annoying me right now . 
So ... for my birthday today I had two teeth pulled then spent a couple hours dealing with a police report/car insurance because my car got broken into on saturday . lol \ 
It's all okay though . Had fun with my friends friday night and had a great dinner with the Fam last night ! STILL had a GREAT birthday weekend !!! \
