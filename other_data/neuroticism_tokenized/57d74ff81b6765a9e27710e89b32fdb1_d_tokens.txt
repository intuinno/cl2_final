is finally able to accomplish something now that the baby is asleep but first something quick to eat and then to fold laundry and when baby gets up it will be bath time and feeding time ... gosh i love my life 
well i feel kinda bad for waking up the baby and bathing him but thankfully he is going to go straight back to sleep and then i get to sleep maybe he will sleep good and long like he did last night . maybe no nighttime feeding one can only hope . 
hmm realizing that hoping he sleeps through the night is jinxing it .... oh well time to get through my day ...
