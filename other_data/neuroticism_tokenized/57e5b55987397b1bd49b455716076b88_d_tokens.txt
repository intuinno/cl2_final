I made no resolutions for the New Year . The habit of making plans , of criticizing , sanctioning and molding my life , is too much of a daily event for me .

In English pubs , ale is ordered by pints and quarts . So in old England , when customers got unruly , the bartender would yell at them mind their own pints and quarts and settle down . It's where we get the phrase \mind your P's and Q's\ "" 
Many years ago in England , pub frequenters had a whistle baked into the rim or handle of their ceramic cups . When they needed a refill , they used the whistle to get some service . \Wet your whistle\ " is the phrase inspired by this practice . " 
Each < PROPMALE > in a deck of playing cards represents a great < PROPMALE > from history : Spades - < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , Hearts - Charlemagne , Clubs - < PROPFIRST > the Great , Diamonds - < PROPMALE > Caesar

Bathrooms , hotel rooms , changing rooms , how many of you know for sure that the seemingly ordinary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror or actually a 2way mirror ? Here's how you know : Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface if there's a GAP between your fingernail and the reflection then it is a GENUINE mirror . If your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the reflection then BEWARE it's a 2way mirror 
< PROPFEMALE>'s full first name is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Roberts . 
I am experiencing humorous feelings , due to the nature of a comment . I laugh audibly , and describe it as an acronym . 
A raisin dropped in a glass of fresh champagne will bounce up and down continually from the bottom of the glass to the top .

The placement of a donkey's eyes in its ' heads enables it to see all four feet at all times . 
Right handed people live , on average , nine years longer than left-handed people\

According to tests made at the Institute for the Study of Animal Problems in Washington , D.C. , dogs and cats , like people , are either right-handed or left-handed --- that is , they favor either their right or left paws . 
The can opener was invented 48 years after the can . 
' Sort of ' is such a harmless thing to say ... sort of . It's just a filler . Sort of ... it doesn't really mean anything . But after certain things , sort of means everything . Like ... after \I love you\ " ... or \ " You're going to live\ " ... or \ " It's a boy ! \"" 
I like video games , but they're really violent . I'd like to play a video game where you help the people who were shot in all the other games . It'd be called ' Really Busy Hospital . ' 
I think that when you get dressed in the morning , sometimes you're really making a decision about your behavior for the day . Like if you put on flip-flops , you're saying : \Hope I don't get chased today . Be nice to people in sneakers . \""

I wrapped my Christmas presents early this year , but I used the wrong paper . See , the paper I used said ' Happy Birthday ' on it . I didn't want to waste it so I just wrote ' Jesus ' on it . 
We traditionally do this in my family by driving around the parking lot until we see a shopper emerge from the mall , then we follow her , in very much the same spirit as the Three Wise Men , who 2,000 years ago followed a < PROPFEMALE > , week after week , until it led them to a parking space . 
Once again we find ourselves enmeshed in the Holiday Season , that very special time of year when we join with our loved ones in sharing centuries-old traditions such as trying to find a parking space at the mall . 
On my new iPod touch !!! 
My rat just made a home in one of my pillows ...... -_-' 
In the old days , it was not called the Holiday Season ; the Christians called it ' Christmas ' and went to church ; the Jews called it ' Hanukka ' and went to synagogue ; the atheists went to parties and drank . People passing each other on the street would say ' < PROPFEMALE > Christmas!' or ' Happy Hanukka!' or ( to the atheists ) ' Look out for the wall!'

' Whatever you give a woman , she will make greater . If you give her sperm , she'll give you a baby . If you give her a house , she'll give you a home . If you give her groceries , she'll give you a meal . If you give her a smile , she'll give you her heart . \ 
She multiplies and enlarges what is given to her . So , if you give her any crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit . '
