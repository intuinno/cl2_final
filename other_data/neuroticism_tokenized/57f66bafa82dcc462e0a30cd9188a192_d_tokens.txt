I'm getting drunk , eating fish & shrimp my neighbor caught in the bayou and fried up tonight ... mmmmm 

This may sound odd , but , I just witnessed an unusual phenomena . As I was sitting in front of my laptop , I heard a popping sound , like an electrical short , accompanied by a spark in midair 30 inches away from any outlet or electronic equipment . Absolutely 
While such collisions are not rare , one of a magnitude great enough to be visible to the naked eye and creating an audible explosion seems quite rare . 
Since I spent the Fourth of July inside my room all night , missing the community fireworks , it seems that mother nature did not want to leave me completely unamazed . ??? Maybe the event coincided with some other event occuring on the other side of the pla 
My thoughts are filled with the ambience of echoes ...

First get the shower running just about as hot as you can stand it . Then close your eyes and move underneath the running water until it is directly on the top of your head . The warm soft dribbling down your face and around your ears feels just like blood gushing from a scalping wound ...

The official diagnosis is ... Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ( RPGN ) . It's not contagious . Have to go on heavy chemotherapy for 3-6 months , then light chemo for another year , before I'm off treatment . Extensive permanent scarring of my kidneys will never recover from , but will be able to repair some of the less damaged portions and get back into better shape than I've been . 
I love my store . Of the many places I have worked , where they profess to be ' Like a Family ' , this job is the only one I've known where my coworkers truly are like family . 
Life is good , and it keeps getting better . 
Those who are unencumbered by fear are free . Knowledge prevents fear of the unknown . Yet , the more we learn , the better we understand how little we know . Face the unknown armed with the knowledge that you have the courage to learn . Of course , you are free to be afraid if you want to be . 
Sometimes it seems like ... I live in a world of unintentional consequences ... 
Happy Holidays to all my friends and family . Hope you are all well and safe this Christmas season .

Endzeitstimmung-Falling from a moonbeam the Merchant of suicide on the lonely and weary commits his genocide . A cold heart pumps , Freewill , the divine infection ... Open veins spill , the delicious corruption calling from the other side . Airbourne disease , spreading at the speed of sound , in psychotropic verse . On fragile nerves pound a drumbeat smashing senses , dark waves rising < PROPFEMALE > me to my final resting place .
