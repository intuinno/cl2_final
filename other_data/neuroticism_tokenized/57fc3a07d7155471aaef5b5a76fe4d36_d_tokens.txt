Happy 1.1.11 !! 

to-good collection of Garbage Pail Kids cards in order to fuck 
So ... North < PROPFEMALE > . Yep . 
Hiking today <3 Can't wait to get outdoors in almost 70 degree weather ! 
So ... just drove all the way to work to find out I have today off . At least I got to see the sunrise ? 
Want a laugh ? Type \Find < PROPMALE > Norris\ " into Google then click I'm Feeling Lucky . " 
Got my first hug from a client tonight , made my day :] Hug your technicians people !! 
Possible haircut tomorrow , what should I do ??? 
Just got my truck back from the shop . After almost a month of it clanking and rattling at me the silence is beautiful :] 
Bouncing around my living room playing wii tennis but wishing I had Wiifit ! 
Going hiking early tomorrow with < PROPMALE > if anyone wants to join us :] 
What a hike :] Me and < PROPMALE > had the summit all to ourselves , so it was worth it getting up early to go ! 
Tin's a bad influence .... to pierce or not to pierce my lip ? 
Being at a tattoo parlor makes getting a tattoo so tempting ... 
The old guy carriage surfing in the parking lot just made my day :] 
Closing the day with some < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > Blonde ice cream ... Mmmmm <3 
Dying in this heat after being in AC all day for work </3 
Come on thunder !!! 
Lookit that rain ... so much for rollerblading with the dog . 
Be a best friend , tell the truth and overuse I Love You . Go to work , do your best , don't outsmart your common sense . 
Haha ... wow . I made it , can't believe it . Just got my final grades and after this summer internship school is done . I don't know whether to sigh in relief or go crazy and start on my bachelor's degree :] It was a great two years , with some great people , that just flew by . 
So now it's tomorrow and the party's still going on next door but I had to call it quits . Graduation went well ( should've got my hat signed before , not after ! ) and the food afterwards was delicious :] All that's left for now is ... sleep . 
Ugh ... benadryl . I can breathe but I feel too heavy to move . It's too early to fall asleep again ! 
I think I should swallow less water when I go swimming D: 
Ah , New England . The sun is out and it's raining ... 
Courage isn't always a lion's roar-it is sometimes the heart at the end of a day saying ... \I will try again tomorrow . \"" 
I just survived driving through my first New England torrential downpour ; including but not limited to four up to the wheel-wells ponds in the middle of the road and two moments where I couldn't even see the double yellows :] I win . 
9 days to Florida . Whoa ... 
Four days ! 
So Florida ... yep . So far it's got alcohol and lizards . 
Worked 7am - 8pm . 13 Hours is too much , I have no idea how some of the girls there do doubles ( 17 hours D: ) . Kudos . \ 
But I missed most of the thunder storm since I was inside . Oooh well . 
Just saw Inception . Don't know where to begin . Makes me want to jump in bed and start dreaming but my mind's going too fast to sleep . I need some of that sedative , Yusuf !! 
Power's out from the center of el to Springfield , has been since eleven last night and should be until noon today . Was fun last night but kind of boring during the day ! 
Another storm ? Really ?? Well , at least there's thunder this time and not just rain . 
Going back to Bigelow Hollow today ! Wish I had my fishing pole still ... 
Oh , yeah . Truck is /back/ in the shop . Rear brake line rusted or something and was leaking everywhere . Having no brakes is not fun , having no truck is worse . Not sure when I'm getting it back . 
Sorry guys , phone decided to shit the bed today . It's no longer even taking a charge so you'll have to get a hold of me here until probably Friday when the new one comes in ( thank god for warranties ) . 
Quaking in my BOOTS . Getting my hair cut at 11:30 D: Wish me luck !!!!! 
Lower all booms and dump bodies ! 
Late night bike ride , strangely fulfilling . 
Don't want to bouffant in your pants during your special . 
Proven wrong : < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was epic . 
Ice cream : it's what every teenage farmboy wants . 
So I meant to post this last night but I crashed as soon as we got home . \ 
First of all , THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR THE BIRTHDAY WISHES :D Yes , I did \ 
have a great day . Still not my type of music but Ozzfest was a blast ! \ 
Wouldn't have been as much fun without being in the pit . I knew about 5%\ 
of the songs . Things got crazy when Motley Crue came on ; the security \ 
were assholes 
but it was still fun watching them drag people out of the \ 
pit . No , I didn't get into a mosh pit but there were some that came \ 
pretty close . The second stage got rained out ( we should get half our \ 
money back for that ) , we all got soaked , and Ozzy didn't spray the foam \ 
or water nearly close enough to us at all . Anyway , ears are ringing and \ 
phone's dead and lost - gotta go find it . <3 
Huddling against the wall of shrinking college trends with the days living faster now we cast our make pretends . 
I will not conform to your sheepery ! 
San < PROPFEMALE > , where you can spend the day watching a cable broad loaded with wide-eyed Australian men . 
New best thing ever : blowing bubbles in bumper to bumper traffic . Keep an eye out if anyone mentions the buick on I91 north that was doing that :D 
Going to go get a little greasy and work on the bikes before today heats up too much to want to bother . 
Going to Vermont for a few days , don't miss me too much . 
Book burning religious extremists carrying guns ... thankfully I don't live in Florida . I might have tried to shoot them myself . 
So did he really cancel or is he just shooting out bullshit like usual ? 
A hundred yellow ribbons ' round the ole oak tree <3 
Loooong day at the Big E today , got the sun burn to prove it ! 
I think I almost just went airborne with an umbrella . 
Stuck with the music again , oh well . Come buy a program at the Big E !!! 
Fall cleaning time ! 
Wish I knew how to cook ... until then , cheez-its for dinner . 
Finally found a good pattern/tutorial for my ears so ... who has the sewing machine ?! 
At gate 1A , come to the Big E and buy a program ! A little rain never hurt anyone . 
Xbox 360 : $200 Halo Reach : $60 Headset : $20 Listening to < PROPMALE > talk/sing to himself in multiplayer : Priceless . 
Back to the Big E this morning , at least the rain looks like it finally quit . Wish me and my truck good luck and hope to see you there ! :] 
Cats are weird creatures . Mine were trying to be all inconspicuous hovering over my boots so I ignored them ... look back ten seconds later and they pulled both my socks out . Uh ... why ?? 
I like it in the closet ;] 
Got five hours of sleep last night and woke up sicksicksick . Can't breath well enough to sleep it off and that nasty bitter vegetarian melt < PROPFIRST > had me try didn't help much . Time for more theraflu I think , and a big heavy blanket . Mrr . 
I went to a scrabble party last night and played \ 
the lottery , everybody was eating lobster but later it turned into \ 
boggle followed by a few rounds of poker 
Why is nobody home !? It's -wednesday- night , not friday or saturday .... what am I missing here ? 
Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Aucoin for the soft doom to my poor left eye !! 
“Flatter me , and I may not believe you . Criticize me , and I may not like you . Ignore me , and I may not forgive you . Encourage me , and I will not forget you . Love me and I may be forced to love you . \ - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > " 
Just saw a three car crash ; massachusetts in front , new york in the middle and pennsylvania in back . By the way , I'm in conneticut ... 
What is there to do in this town for FREE ??? So far I have ... hiking . And that's a half hour away . Anything scenic is even further away and anything fun is $$$ . Oh , East Longmeadow , why do you fail me so ? 
Got arm warmers and one ear done , taking a break before I start on the next ear . My fingers need some recovery time from my novice sewing skills . I need a sewing machine ._. 
I missed my < PROPMALE > in Las Vegas but I'm getting another , this one in Tennessee !! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > should be hosting a concert to raise money for flood relief there so I get one more < PROPMALE > to see him in concert ... 
Vermont , you better be good to me . I'm leaving a lot behind to go to you . 
As of right now ... by myself for at least 10 days .......... oh boy . 
I've got two tickets to paradise !!!! That is , two tickets to Tennessee thanks to < PROPFIRST > Laliberte . Actually , just tickets to the concert there . Now I need to figure out the flights and rooms .... shit . 
Hahaha I heard you guys down in Mass got some snow , eh ? Only a little bit of wind up here :] 
People taste bitter . 
The most complicated buy at the grocery store ? Paper towels . 
Mom's babysitting < PROPMALE > , but I ended up laying down for a nap before he did despite the mysterious arm pain that started up last night still hanging around . Is it possible to pinch a nerve in both your shoulders ??? 
Snow ! 
Huzzah for 3 1/2 hours of sleep and another night of looming insomnia . 
Well , I was going to say : \Help ! Someone stop me ! I found the Christmas music station online and it won't stop ! \ " But ... firefox beat everyone to the punch and crashed itself . Win or fail ?? " 
From 58 degrees last night to 70 degrees tonight :] I <3 space heaters ! 
I never eat December snowflakes , I always wait until January . 
Why is so hard to whistle with your fingers !?! Thanks for making it seem easy < PROPFIRST > LaLiberte 
Lunar eclipse at 3:30 am tomorrow ! Who'll be up with me ? :D 
Mmm southern accents . I like Tennessee already :] 
Oh Nashville you poor flooded thing ... but all your adult shops seem to have made out fine . Been here less than a day and seen three so far . 
I haven't had pink eye for YEARS and what do I wake up with the morning of the concert ?? For once I can finally say ... FML . 
Oh . My . Fucking . God . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > live = amazing . My only disappointment was no Belleau Wood but no concert will ever be the same after that . I'm a country girl at heart after all ... 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS ! 
SLEDDING ! 
Discovered today that my < PROPFIRST > size ranges from 6 to 15 . Who wants to explain how that makes sense ? 
My cat turned 3 today , and for her birthday I drugged her , stuffed her in a box and drove her four hours away from home . Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > :] 
Overrun by the zombies in RDR ._. 
Kicking Pluto off the planet list is like kicking < PROPFEMALE > out of the rainbow , and I don't know any < PROPFIRST > G Bi . 
Went out to put the recyclables by the road and found some canine prints in the snow and on the back sidewalk ... wish they were decent prints so I could tell if it was just someone's stray dog or if I have to start looking out for coyotes :] 
Sending in a job application ... as soon as HCC sends me my transcript . Wish me luck ! 
I move further North , where you think all the big bad storms are going to hit but ... nope ! Massachusetts gets them all :D We have maybe 4-5\ and a very light snowfall right now <3 " 
Peaceful silence has no meaning until you've experienced it in Vermont . 
I love all these quotes I see lingering around facebook with girlfriends complaining about their boyfriends playing too much CoD Black Ops and not giving them any attention . To that I say ... I just got Black Ops in the mail , so to xbox I go ! :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Aucoin IS DATING A HIGH SCHOOLER . 
BROTHER'S WEEK !!!! If you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , and is someone you can't live without , copy and paste this to your status ? 
Northern Vermont is finally supposed to be getting some of the snow I've been hearing all the rest of you complain about . That is ... getting it tomorrow :] I'll let you know if we ever do get snowed in ! 
< PROPFIRST > LaLiberte finishes first . 
It's snowing again , but this time with a little lightning and thunder :D <3 
Been outside to shovel 3 times in 6 hours and still feel restless :| 
Lots of movie commercials this Super Bowl :\\ But my favorite ? Darth Vader :D Close second ? The Best Buy with Ozzie and what's-his-face that looks like a girl . 
Deep into that darkness peering , long I stood there wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before . 
Ugh , whitening strips taste weird ... 
The wind is so bad the house is trembling and my bed is shaking . Plus , the lights just flickered . Likely to lose power , I think , and not just because a tree went down on the power lines . Ohhhhhh boy . 
Jersey tomorrow ~ ~ !! 
I got seashells from the seashore at seaside 
Oh noooo ~ ! The cadbury easter commercial just came on , and I gave up < PROPFEMALE > for new years ! I will miss cadbury mini eggs this year !! 
So turns out the job I thought I was starting May 9th I am now starting ... this Monday :D 
Coolest thing ever ? Watching the shadow of clouds race across the frozen white lake towards you . 
So wait , what ?!? Are we in -three- wars now ? WTF is going on !! 
Watched the sun come up this morning ... I think I'm going to like getting up early . 
$312 ... not bad for my first paycheck in , oh , 7 months . 
< PROPMALE > my clothes out on the line for the first time this winter . Mmmmmmmm ~ ! 
Springtime : blue skies , warm weather , longer days , and more dead things on the side of the road . Tally so far : one bird , one cat , two dogs/coyotes .
