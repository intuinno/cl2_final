Hey < PROPMALE > Gross , thanks for leaving me an umbrells for today ! Oh , and see you later at < PROPMALE > Saunders for dinner ? Maybe ? 
What's up with no one wearing belts ? Did I miss something ? 
Why can't we more often have the fun and energy of Market Days weekend without have the size and mess of it ? 
Oh nice , right outside my window at work they are ripping up a street . 
I hope this week has started as leftovers of last week and that it really will be a nice week . 
To sum up today : Frustrating and Worthless . Time for a damn nap . 
I feel like I would have been safer in an earthquake in a 3rd world country than continuing to ride on that CTA bus . 
All this practice for the Air and Water show reminds be of when I lived in the Middle East ( minus the constant explosions ) . 
I say it's no good when I can walk home on the east side of the street without having the sun in my eyes . 
Yes , I'm excited for the 3$ I just found in my jeans . < PROPFIRST > Cox doesn't seem to care because apparently HE'S the real big \bollar . \"" 
That's what I like about going out during the week . Seeing friends I haven't seen in forever . 
That would have been funny : The streetcleaner hitting my bus . 
Dr. < PROPFEMALE > , I kinda want an apology to your apology for using the \N\ " word . " 
Whirleyball is today's Groupon .... I'm so sad I'm not buying any :( 
If you're in Lakeview , and under the age of 5 or over the age of 55 , you're walking around with your fingers in your ears today . 
Drop Dead Diva-ing . 
I could only hope it would stay this temperature all day . That would be perfect . 
I'm tired of the ( any ) President having to go on TV and defend anything he says or does . Get back to governing please . You're not a < PROPFEMALE > in a soap opera drama ( even though that's politics these days ) . 
is conquering the world . 
The Crazies ? All alone by myself ? Smart idea . 
Since anorexia was so 90's/early 2Ks , I'm gonna go make a pizza . 
loves playing SCRABBLE with Brien < PROPFEMALE > . 
So restless . Will need coffee . 
I . Love . < PROPFEMALE > De La Vara . 
From overhearing multiple conversations , it appears there will be MANY tourists out in Boystown tonight . 
Just because it's \America : Land of the Free(ish)\ " doesn't mean it's the Land of Class and Dignity . "

Bad mood , please go away by 7am . I don't want to wake up with you in the bed with me . Thx .

Hello , large coffee . :-) 
I finally got a program to play DVDs on my computer . That means I'm laying in bed watching The Adventures of < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > . 
feels kinda like a retard . You know , like where people just give crazy looks , but you don't know any better and are just trying to be happy . 
A nap sounds really good right about now . 
Doing the Dew one last time before I try ' healthy ' again . No soda , no Redbull , no vodka . 
Hello Gym , surprised to see me ? 
Umm , I despise American Idol . Tell me then , why am I reading the article about JLo coming on ? #quithalfwaythrough 
I can't wait for reality TV to die so people can get back to re-al-it-yyyyy . #waitingforever 
Really bad dream last night . So that's what it's like to have family that hates you :-(

I love a storm cloudy day .

can dream , but would rather continue having the nightmares . 
Short day at work = some needed cleaning will be getting done .

I don't get why you get so upset by foreigners who can't read English when there are plenty of Americans who choose to not read English . 
is really gonna have to run to make the Megabus :-/ 
Doesn't it make you happy when you make someone else happy ? When they have good things to say about you ? 
Back home in Chicago and I'm hungry ! 
Date Night alone feels ..... awkward .... 
Halloween costume making time !!! 
Fifty minutes into #AngryBirds felt like 5 minutes . 
What to do tonight .... What . To . Do . 
Hulu , you piss me off . Really . 
Today has been a combination of random events , in a good way . If this is life when I don't shave for 3 days , I'm never doing drag again . 
Makeover day has begun ! Only 7 days to get ready .... 
That 2 hour nap I had earlier ? Yeah , felt good , but it's gonna keep me up ;-) 
I've never seen < PROPMALE > Horror . 
Skillet cooked pork chops , instant mashed potatoes and microwaved green beans : And I still feel fancy . Would have been better if I had some < PROPFEMALE > . 
One workday to go until a FIVE day weekend ! 
Yeah ... totally kinda #awkward when straight people ask me about my #Halloween costume at work ... 
I'm so ready to cheer on < PROPFIRST > Billhardt in the < PROPMALE>'s Tavern Wet Boxer Contest ! 
Too often people avoid those interactions that make people human . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > just stole my drink ! 
Ummm , are gays the only people that shop at Target - < PROPMALE > Yard ? 
If < PROPMALE > Saunders would have checked-into Sidetrack The Video Bar , then I'd have thought that Chaz < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > De La Vara and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > were just trying to make a statement . 
Now , where did I put that HOT glue gun ? 
I need to be enlightened : What does sagging your pants mean about your lifestyle ? And to also do it while jogging ? 
Almost time to mutate !! #TMNT 
I could really go for a glass ( bottle ) of wine ! 
The more you try to stress me out , the more I'm going to try to ignore you . It's pretty simple . 
Conquer the world -OR- Do chores 
Was I really just scared half-to-death by a leaf blowing on the sidewalk ? Yes , yes I was . 
No wonder this tastes weird : I bought a Diet Mtn Dew . 
Today might be a Sim City 4 kind of day ... avoiding chores , of course . 
I could really go for some < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s .... 
Like this status if you'll remember who < PROPFIRST > Billhardt is . RIP < PROPMALE>'s Facebook account , RIP .

Looking at the weather channel : #Vacation is gonna be WET and COLD . The way we like it . 
is back in a cell coverage area ! 
I'm pretty kinda addicted to #Alchemy . Download it for your phone . Free ! Hate me later . ;-) 
If I was doing < PROPFEMALE > shots at 9am , you'd say I had a problem . I feel pretty much the same about your pot smoking . 
I love how I attempt to close the box , put it just over an arm's length away , but somehow the box of crackers is gone 30 seconds later . 
Today's Groupon is a good one , but the picture/modelz irks me . Doesn't quite show the \array\ " they are trying to sell . " 
Streetwise guys sure hate it when you tell them \no thanks\ " and \ " have a good night . \"" 
Just now taking off today's work clothes . Oops . 
The Australian lady walked out the wrong way through the revolving door . #itmakessense 
Planning out a budget SUCKS ! 
I wondered why there was all of this JUNK in my Facebook feed . #ama 
This woman next to me on the bus is singing like I do when I * KNOW * I'm alone .

Ooops . Forgot to make my bed . Now , I have to sleep in it . #unmadebedwithnosheets :( 
I'm afraid to look out my window . 
Riding the roller coaster is more fun than fixing it . 
Starving ! It's a good diet . 
Ok , 18 year olds aren't supposed to be drunk . Just cute . 
Everything in life is < PROPMALE > . Luck is just glorified < PROPMALE > . 
Tonight was the kind of bar night I needed . 
Time to go retro for a few days . #brokendishwasher 
Ordering Domino's . This is gonna put me far off my budget , but < PROPFIRST > Arguijo teased my stomach . ( tease ) 
I feel so exhausted I believe it acceptable to say I'm sexhausted . #combinedwordssavetime 
The NEW layout : We've been through Facebook changes enough to know to not bitch about it . AND , I could get carried away ( and possibly banned ) with this \who inspires you\ " section ... " 
Dinner = [ yellow tail ] Pinot Grigio . 
Sad they didn't kiss after the gay duet . 
I feel so Republican right now . 
I'm glad Pandora told me I can't skip through anymore of this pussy-ass crybaby music . How is it productive ? #lovethethingsIhate 
I like being the cutest thing < PROPFIRST > Brannan can see . 
Counting down til naptime . 
I want to play Civ5 all day . Anyone want to multiplay ? < PROPMALE > Sha'freefurall Ring or < PROPMALE > Silverstone ? 
Oh gods I love finding typos on CNN . 
Shot of wine & bedtime . 
Oops ! 
Diversey 
I thought having some of my best friends ' Facebook statuses sent to my phone was I fun idea . They update too much ! :-) 
Dinner should be an amazing dinner for 1 . 
The Debate : Pandora or iTunes ?

After the series of dreams I just had , I'm thinking my mind is trying to hide something from me . That , or trying to trick me into uncovering something in hiding .

Work is closing early . Apparently there is some big blizzard coming ... 
Possibly the most funnest part of my winter so far was jumping through the snowdrifts just now . 
My breasts can tell when it's snowing . There's a 33% < PROPMALE > it's already snowed . 
So , tonight I heard about The A-List : New York . I just watched the intro and I'm about to puke . 
You know , I once at Subway so often it made me sick . Same thing is happening now with the radio . #stopplayingBritneysnewsongevery10minutes 
If you post a 4 line reply on a website that contains ZERO punctuation or capitalized letters , then whatever point you are trying to make is void .
