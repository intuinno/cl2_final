When you're dreaming with a broken heart , waking up is the hardest part 
When life gives you lemons , throw them back in life's face 
You and I have memories longer than the road that streches out ahead

“Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching . . . . I have been bent and broken , but—I hope—into a better shape . ”
