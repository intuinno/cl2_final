my Horoscope : Your concept of reality could be based more on your emotions than facts , Cancer . This is one of those days when this could get you into trouble . Whatever comes up , you're likely to feel very passionate about it and tend to lose any rational perspective whatsoever . Integrity , inner strength , and self-confi ... dence will be the glue that holds your mind and heart together .

One day I'll be just what you said I could never be\ 
One day I'll leave you far behind just like the time you left me - Psyclone Nine - The Purging 
God Module - Victims Among Friends\ 
\ 
Dont think you know me \ 
Not everyone is who they seem to be \ 
Do not trust your instincts \ 
Or the words you read or faces you see ... 
No symbols can describe \ 
This fracture that I feel inside\ 
You still want to see \ 
Some worth hidden inside of me\ 
Dont fool yourself again \ 
You were my victim not my friend ! 
No symbols to describe \ 
This nothing that I feel inside\ 
No soul to leave me paralyzed \ 
You were never my friend\ 
An emptiness only I can see \ 
To me its a gift not a disease\ 
Want me to hurt you just say please \ 
I was never you friend ! 
No symbols , no symbols can describe \ 
This fracture that I feel\ 
Im the enemy in the end \ 
A victim among your friends \ 
You were my victim not my fucking friend ! 
idk what to do ... I know what I want to do . but i know the other choice is probably smarter .

All or nothing it's written in blood

see the corpses rise from there graves\ 
listen close you can hear them say\ 
they can smell your brains , they can smell your brains , they can smell your brains and they can smell your\ 
i think it's everdent you , if you send more paramedics 
Here I sit \ 
A vampire at my piano \ 
The flames burn glaringly higher \ 
And the eyes that stare \ 
through the darkness \ 
Though they have no form \ 
There's no need for alarm 
187 days 22 hours 20 mins and 55 seconds till Germany ! I'm getting excited . \Here I sit \ 
I don't know why , \ 
You're blaming me . \

Your waving hands . \ 
Confronting me , \ 
With the bitter side of all this publicity . \

Anticipation taking hold\ 
Second thoughts will never get you the girl\ 
Though it had occurred to me this might go bad\ 
The obsession kept stuck to the plan\ 
I ran up the steps\ 
As my heart pumped fast\ 
Then I knocked perhaps a bit to light\ 
And she opened up the door\ 
In only her coat\ 
And a smile that said \ 
' This better be worth it ' 
Whisper to me softly , I'm yours , \ 
Until we know that it's time to leave . \ 
Act as if this is forever , \ 
Assume the roles we can never be'Cause all these friends of mine\ 
would like to think that they've found the one . \ 
But tell me that with us it's different\ 
Tell me that we've just begun . 
I thought she was an angel \ 
Beautiful and kind \ 
Till the day she ran away \ 
And blew my mind\ 
I tried to hold her \ 
Keep her in my arms \ 
She was so cold \ 
And when she smiled I felt \ 
My heart was torn apart 
Deutschland ! 185 Days ! Woot ! 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! I wish I had a time machine ! 
dreams and wishes will be made ... 
Am I suffocating right ? \ 
Is there anybody watching ? \ 
Is there anything inside\ 
that might keep me here 
I feel really off tonight . 
Im so going to buy me a Fur coat soon .. 
I heard it's cold out , but her popsicle melts \ 
She's in the bathroom , she pleasures herself \ 
Says I'm a bad man , she's locking me out \ 
It's cause of these things , it's cause of these things \ 
Let make a fast plan , watch it burn to the ground \ 
I try to whisper , so no one figures it out \ 
I'm not a bad man , I'm just overwhelmed \ 
It's cause of these things , it's cause of these things 
I hope 2011 goes for the better 
Inside , all is quiet and calm \ 
Inside , I'll keep you safe from harm \ 
Inside , all is perfect here \ 
Inside , as long as I am here \ 
Inside , I'm coming over you \ 
Inside , and all I want to do \ 
Inside , to keep your fears in me \ 
Inside , to have you close to me 
I need to get drunk . anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out and do something this saturday and/or sunday ? 
\Don't promise anything you can't deliver to me . \"" 
this sucks .. I cant sleep . and have a busy day today starting at 8am ... 
cant wait for the new year ! 
One day I'll leave you far behind just like the time you left me 
Happy First-Day-of- Yule !
