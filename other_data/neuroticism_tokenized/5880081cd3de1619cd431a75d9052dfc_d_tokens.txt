back to my modified Russian tuning . It sounds so much more full . 

caught fireflies in a jar , am going to soak my feet in some piping hot water , and is just relaxing to Chopin and a good book . 
ran 19 < PROPMALE > today . Shower , a big glass of water , and then cleaning up the house . 
is elated ! 
$500.00 for stitches ?! 
Why is it that everyone else's musical tastes go forward and mine seem to switchback ? 
is extremely bored . Late night run to North and back . 
Day Seven of Spring Break : Work out , work , work out , work , television , sleep . Flood fixed , water on , time to clean everything now . 
Day Eight of Spring Break : Work , work , work . Watch Castle at the Fishbowl or go for a walk and play guitar ? 
Putting music onto my iPod and watching Castle . Maybe a walk later on tonight ... I find my life rather boring at times . 
is having kefir and cookies , taking a nap , then the gym for some relaxation . Great weekend already . 
< PROPFIRST > , the kid that grew up in my house 75 years ago , came by today . Told me of some letters carved on a windowsill . Still there . :D 
work , work , study , work . Pink < PROPMALE > on the playlist for the day . 
Drinking a < PROPMALE > and watching the Wings win caps off a very tiring day . 
Today begins my yearly purge : reduce my possessions to ~ whatever can fit into two bags and a backpack . 
Hockey or coffee and the < PROPMALE > museum ? 
personally decimated the gnat population on my run . 
Greatest American rock band of all time ? Go ! 
Best British Invasion band sans Beatles ? Go ! 
My brother is coming to town tomorrow ! 
I feel low ; beyond blues , more genuine than other genres . Extremely low , < PROPFIRST > Bowie low . 
Woke up because of the thunderstorm and think that I'm going to start < PROPFEMALE > Karenina today . 
serious writers block . Suggestions ? 
Just got a friend request from myself on Facebook . Is this narcissism ? If I don't know who I am should I deny the request ? 
Is it sad that the only time I watch ESPN is when they have a concert on ? 
Book , blanket , and Arb . Maybe later I'll start work on my raft . 
I play my music so loud that it annoys the vuvuzela players . 
Just found out my gym membership is still good ! I have something to do with my time now . Woooooo !!!! 
Is exhausted . 
Has given in and will begin watching Cowboy Bebop . 
has spent the better part of two days learning how to play drums . 
feels like a rocker : played music all day and smell faintly of pizza and the Chaldean I passed . All I need is a Cinnamon Girl and , you know , groupies or fans . 
Off to the river to do some swimming . 
Tuning up the guitars today and tomorrow . I'm in bliss . :-)) 
One of the little joys in life : rearranging my musical collection , not chronologically or alphabetically - autobiographically . 
Wednesday . Only a few more days until Wednesday . 
Doing some of my favorite things today : reading at Espresso , going for a walk in the Arb , and getting a pint later tonight with friends . 
in Arizona . Just in time for the Perseid meteor shower ! I love Arizona skies . 
Sitting in a massage chair ( the first massage I've ever had ) , drinking warm green tea and a splash of vodka , finished with my work for the day , listening to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and organizing my music collection with my guitar in reach . Ahhh . 
Lost ~ 15 lbs in three weeks . Guess what : if you're fat it's not a disease , you're just lazy and weak . 
trying to resist the urge to destroy everything in the library while listening to The Clash . 
< PROPMALE > kids just found out after a month that I understand what they are saying . I let pass a little \bis später\ " - mouths to the floor . " 
To all of my Michigan friends : How are you guys ?! I haven't been on in a while so update me !

Reworked every homework assignment , every quiz , every exam and practice exam . Made a study sheet , a sheet listing every table , figure , equation , and pages with relevant examples . 12 questions , 50% of my grade - I'm ready ! 
\De-friended\ " a bunch of people that I haven't talked to or haven't talked with me in quite a while . If you're one of them and you want to talk then click that friend request button . " 
Playing guitar . I haven't dedicated time to this since Michigan . It's like my old Christmas present all over again ! 
Yet another reason to dislike Arizona : walking around the block trying to get Internet involves being chased by javelina . 
Saw wild horses today up north . Went two-tracking in the snowmelt , talked politics , have a hoarse voice from belting out Zeppelin tunes , and spent the rest of the day at the gym . An awesome day by all accounts . 
At the request of a friend , I'm learning metal . But , I never go full metal so I'm easing in with Soundgarden . It's all a bit dark for my taste ( that's why I dig Tool - happy , can-do metal ) 
What will the neighbors think : first old blues covers , Hendrix , Clapton , < PROPFEMALE > Jam , The Clash , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , opera , and lastly Flamenco . 
Bread , a good < PROPMALE > , and Pokemon on a snowy , gray day . It's like I'm in MI again ! Also , I decided on my long walk that I'm going to be an awesome guitarist of the < PROPFIRST > Green/ < PROPFIRST > Renbourn variety . 
Need new music . Give me some ideas of something I haven't listened to in a long time or is completely new . Oh , first week of work and I'm already going to be over on hours . :) I love what you can do with money .
