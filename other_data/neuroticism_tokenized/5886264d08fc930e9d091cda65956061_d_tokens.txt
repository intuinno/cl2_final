Stupid cancer ... we all wish to have a new car ... new phone ... to lose weight ... a person who has cancer only wants one thing ... to fight their cancer ... i know that 97% of you guys won't put this on your wall ... but 3% of my friends will .... Put it on your wall in honor of someone who died from cancer or who's fighting against it now
