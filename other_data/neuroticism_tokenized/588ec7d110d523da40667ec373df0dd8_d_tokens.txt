Ode to a Shedding Cat\ 
I think that I shall never see , \ 
A cat that sheds as much as thee . \ 
Thy fur that sticks is all around , \ 
On chairs , on mats in little mounds . \ 
I sweep the floor , you shed some more . \ 
I wash the rug , and you just shrug . \ 
You should give thanks I tolerate that or you would be a crew-cut cat . -- Author Unknown
