While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make yourwoman CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence

We've got this gift of love , but love is like a precious plant . You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself . You've got to keep watering it . You've got to really look after it and nurture it . ----- the great < PROPFIRST > lennon 
be impeccable with your word - what we say does make a difference our live\ 
don't take anything personally - fuck what anyone says you are the director , producer , actor/actress of your one time in this body\ 
don't make assumptions - Gotta stop !! we always put things in our heads and word in others mouths . \ 
always do your best- put your ALL into EVERYTHING you do 
ONE MORE DAY TILL I GET CLEARED FROM THIS FUCKING FOOT !!! LOOKING FORWARD TO MY DAILY JOG AND MY SEXY HEELS AGAIN ! 
MAN not what I wanted to hear ! still fucking healing !! 
man why can't we work 3 days a week and have the rest off ? weekend was too short ! 
POSITIVE THOUGHT FOR THE DAY : you should never look down on someone unless they're giving you head 
HOPE EVERYONE HAD A FUN FULL TURKEY DAY !!! 
I GUESS TRYING ISN'T HELPING WONDER IF NOT TRYING WILL WORK ? 
feels good to be needed but it would be nice to feel wanted

my poor baby he got his very first cold 
AWWwwww ..... I was going through my little mans Photo album and it brought tears to my eyes , it's crazy to think that thats my baby , i <3 him so much it hurts . 6 months ago i was waiting for his arrival , i can't wait to see him walk to me with his arms wide open , call me mommy , and have little fights with him . 
its not about losing a few pounds and looking good its about feeling good and finding the passion in your life again 
i'm not a big sports fan at all but there is a hockey player from the chicago wolves as a patient at my job , im thinking about walking in the room and playing nurse with his fine ass !! lol jk i love you joshy

< PROPFEMALE > christmas to everyone !! I enjoyed my first xmas with my little man and my hubby and all the rest of my family that I love with everything I have . < PROPFEMALE > was great but there is nothing like seeing my joshy look like a kid again when he opened his present that Ms. clause got him .

Love doesn't come in a minute , \ 
Sometimes it doesn't come at all\ 
I only know that when I'm in it\ 
It isn't silly , love isn't silly , love isn't silly at all . \ 
\ 
How can I tell you about my loved one ? \ 
( I love you)\ 
I love you\ 
I LOVE YOU JOSHY 
Shared one of the best nights with my sweetheart =D 
enjoying my sunday with my silly little man 
“What you need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened , it has all worked together to bring you to this very moment . And this is the moment you can choose to make everything new Right now . ” 
Blah blah blah .......... =/ 
EVERYTHING HAPPENES FOR A REASON 
Feeling like shit today man and it's friday .... =( 
drugs are not working the friday I was looking forward to with some friends I get to spend it at home with a fever that won't go away , at least my man is letting me rest , thanks babe 
WISH I WAS AT HOME ...... 
happy birthday to my daddy I love you so much !! 
HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY =D 
I've carried a child within my body . Slept with my baby on my chest . I've kissed many boo boo's and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on , and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a Mom , and there is no greater honor . Post this to your status if you are proud to be a Mom ? 
so freaking cold my nose hairs were sticking together to walk from my house to my car !!! lol 
Life is ........... GREAT !! =D 
The longer I live the more I realize the impact of attitude on life . we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will have for the day . We can't change our past and we can't change the fact that people will act in a certain way . I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it . We are in charge of our Attitudes . 
MMmmmmm orange how you look so pretty and taste sooo goooooood 
The sun is up i'm so HAPPY I could SCREAM 
BEEN THERE DONE THAT MESSED AROUND I'M HAVING FUN DON'T PUT ME DOWN 
yes !! snow day !!! the last time I had one I was in grammer school !!!

you know what sucks in this world ? These stange creatures that walk around with two heads and a third leg . 
I love to see that my 60 year old father still runs his ass off on the treadmill

If its no good for you learn how to hate it 
< PROPFEMALE > .. is a fckin bitch .. it will get you .. when you least expect it ! and that's the beauty of it .. it's unexpected ! 
for what ever you don't want or like there is always someone out there that will treat it better 
where there is anger , respond with love . where there is envy , respond with nurturing . where there is fear respond with kindness . 
one of the best feelings in the world is to feel sore all over your body ! lol i can't even laugh with out aching 
ok so to all the moms and dads out there would any of you guys leave your son or daughter with someone you met like 2 or 3 times ?
