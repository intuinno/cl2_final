cant believe i'm actually doing this facebook-thing 

Just finished a day of bargain hunting in SoHo .... $2 t-shirts and underwear at Topman !... followed by a fantastic middle eastern dinner w/ red wine in HK with the boys . Off to watch an Almodovar film from 1984 \What Have I Done to Deserve This ? \ " .... ( aka my middle name ) and rest up for volleyball tryouts tomorrow " 
doing my first grill of the season ( albeit solo ) but just like with men the first time is always special ;) 
also just realized it's time to take some new pics and show off my fantastic tan ! 
ahhhh .... springtime in nolita ! 
Loving the automatic 6 month extension to file taxes . 
It's been one HELL of a week as many of you know but after a serendipitous meeting with a new friend and the unfettered support of so many others I'm getting the life back I deserve . 
Officially logging off for the weekend . Hope everyone has an enjoyable one and spends some time with those who love you . 
LANDED THE COLUMBIA JOB !!!! YAY !!!!!!!! 
grilling meat ... feelin like < PROPFIRST > flinstone and lovin it ! 
grilling burgers with my 2 close friends Gaga and Svedka .... happy memorial day ! 
I can't believe I'm actually logging on to FB again ... but these damn new blackberrys make it too easy . anyway , I'm approaching the end of my 3 weeks down the Jersey Shore ( LBI for those in the know ) and have some pics I took to post from lifeguards to sea grass ... enjoy . and
