My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores , go to school & church . They gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job and work for the things that I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school , at my job & to take pride in my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic & respect for the law , and my elders . I thank God everyday for my \Mean\ " parents . " 
Love having access to the online grade-book ! Just checked grades and both < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > are doing so good ! After years of barely scraping by , seeing these boys have some A's and B's on their report feels so good ! ( < PROPFEMALE > .... < PROPMALE > only has 1 D and < PROPMALE > only has 2 ! That is such an improvement ! YAY ) 
Snowin again ! hope they don't cancel the dance at the high school tonight !

The wind is blowing , the snow is drifting .... and my kids still have to get on that bus .... 
called the service station in < PROPFEMALE > City ( 10 < PROPMALE > from home ) & asked if they could come repair my tire that went flat on side of road 2 mi from home , & she said \no we can't go CLEAR out to Rutland that's too far\ " ... WTF ??? Where do people get their sense of distance traveled from ?? It's not like they are walking .. I did . Walked home from the truck since my tools weren't there . Now it's too < PROPFEMALE > to walk back ! " 
Amen ! < PROPFIRST > Swanson's request to be charged as a juvenile was DENIED ! he will stand trial for 2 murders as an adult !

Doesn't make sense does it ?? Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without the benefits they were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% wont . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'm in the 1% !! 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are ... ?
