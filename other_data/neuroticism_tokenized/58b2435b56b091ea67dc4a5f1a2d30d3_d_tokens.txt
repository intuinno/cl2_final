Well ... This sucks again . Account was deactivated-AGAIN ! It wouldn't be that bad , if they would only give me a reason why . If they deactivate my account again , I'll just be done with Facebook . 
When I die , I want you to bury me upside down , so the whole world can kiss my ass . - Favorite quote . If it wasn't for I want to be creamated when I die , I would have them bury me upside down . 
-is the google < PROPFEMALE > . 
Mowed\ 
the lawn . Funniest thing : a grass hopper jumped into my lap and sat\ 
through the whole back yard . It only jumped out of my lap when I stood . \ 
lol 
Ghost Recon sucks . My brother wouldn't stop killing me then shooting up my dead body ! Gr ! 
Great , now he's killing my none participating body in Unreal Tournament . He's a big fat cheater . 
Wow . I made eight kills on Unreal Tournament . < PROPFIRST > says that's pretty good for a first timer . One of them was me running < PROPFIRST > over for a Hit and Run kill . lol 
I've got to be the most annoying person to play games with . < PROPFIRST > and I were playing Rainbow Six , a game that involves a lot of sneaking to kill people . So , naturally , I make a LOT of disterbances . I was firing at this bomb , and I swore I heard the other guy with us mutter ' your stressing me out ' . 
I kept killing this civilain in Rainbow Six and we kept having to redo the same mission over and over and over becasue everytime , I'd just kill her again . < PROPFIRST>'s reaction each time : ' No , Radreges ! Rodreges ! Don't do it , Rodreges!' ( apperently he names my character Rodreges . lol ) 
Just made an account on Young Writers Society . 
Today at the park was fun . But boy , it was hot ! 
Holy crap , 189,819 . That's how many letters are in the longest word in the English language . It's the chemical name of titin , the largest known protein . \ 
Technically , not in dictionary , and it's even disputed whether it is a word . I don't even think it should be . IT'S TO LONG ! How would you even go around pronoucing it ?! 
Me : I want to go to the library . \ 
Mom : Why do you want to go to the library ? \ 
Me : ... \ 
Stupidest question my mother has ever asked me . 
I have the sudden urge to write a short mystery . lol The only problem is , my short strories never stay short . 
Mowing the lawn is fun . But the after affects are awful . Damn allergies . >.> 
StoryBlue is awesome . 
< PROPFIRST > burnt popcorn . IT'S SMELLS SO BAD ! But as my mother reminds me , it's not near as bad when I burnt the popcorn . lol The kitchen smelled for weeks after that . 
No < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow , so I don't have to go to bed early tonight . After fifteen weeks of going to be early on Sunday nights , it feels so weird to be up this late tonigh . lol 
We went forwheeling today . It was awesome : there was a bunch of mud in our path , so we got dirty . My poor aunt Conni was on the back of the forwheeler with me . She didn't hold onto me the way she was suppose to and almost flew off the back when we came over a rut . It was funny , though . 
-is the spam < PROPFEMALE > . XD 
The bachelor and bachelorette have to be the most stupidest show I've seen . It's all fake . 
Wipeout-it's so much fun watching these people get the crap beat out of them by giant rubber ... THINGS ! lol I don't know what else to call them . lol 
Don't you just love laxing out on the back or the couch like one of the cats-until your mom pushes you off . lol 
I heard this song on the radio . First thing I said , ' this girl has a nice singing voice . ' I pause . ' This is < PROPFIRST > Beiber , isn't it ? ' I waited till the end of the song . Yeah , it was . I haven't heard him sing in awhile . I forgot just how much he sounds like a girl . Actually , I think he sounds more like a girl now , then when he first started . I feel really sorry for him . But can't help but make fun of him anyways . lol 
If u put ur hand over my mouth . I swear , I will lick u . : knowing me , I wouldn't lick you , I'd bite you if you put your hand over my mouth . XD 
-can't wait for Splice to come out . Looks awesome ! 
Happy Town-epicest new series EVER ! 
I have no problame with spiders . They do their thing , I do mine . But one can't help but be shocked when they find a spider on their hand , THE SIZE OF THEIR HAND . I ended up throwing the spider halfway accross the yard in my shock . Once I recovered , I couldn't find it . lol 
I love writing mystery . Just to get my brain working for mystery , I watch Clue over , and over , and over , and over . I LOVE THAT MOVIE ! < PROPMALE > Curry is awesome . :D 
Going to see Splice tomorrow ! Yes ! I am intisipating this movie will ALMOST be as great as Saw-from what I saw in the previews . 
What is with family and always wanting a picture of you ? If I could , I would kill the creator of cameras ... if he is/were still alive . 
Well , Splice wasn't what I thought . But it was still good . I expected more killing ... And I certainly didn't expect any of the lead characters to servive . 
Went to get gas for my truck . First pump we pulled up to said it was out of order . Mom and I found that kind of funny . We laughed . Second one we pulled up to was out of order . Okay , still kind of funny . But we didn't laugh this time . Third one we pulled up to said it was out of order . Okay , that's not funny anymore . That jusy pissed me off . Apperently , getting gas today was not meant to be easy . 
Holy crap . I tried that question thing where you answer a question about another person , and the first one they gave me was : ' Would you go skinny dipping with < PROPFIRST > Allen ? ' \ 
Oh , that scares me ... lol 
Cadillac Man , i love that movie . \ 
Larry : I shot a cop ! \ 
Joey : No you didn't!\ 
Larry : Yeah , I shot a cop ! \ 
Joey : No , you shot a foot . Calm down . - lol 
I'm never playing Corn Hole again . No matter where I stand . No matter who I'm playing with or against . The bags always end up hitting me ! First it was funny , but after getting smacked in the face three times by different people , you just get tired of it . 
Randy : < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , I thought this guy was a girl on account of his girly butt . - LOL 
I don't have a handbag ... 
Uge . Why can't they just let you play a computer on some of these facebook games ? -_- 
Two Brothers is the best movie in the world . I have yet to find a I like more . 
\We are going to inherit the earth . There is not the slightest doubt\ 
-can't wait for Holiday World this Saturday . Hope it on't be to hot . >.> If it is , WATER RIDES ! lol 
The Simpsons - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > animated ! Holy crap ! 
Purfume : Story of a Murderer - had the most unsettling ending I've ever seen in a horror movie . It was just ... there really isn't any words to describe it . It was just awful . 
Ergo Proxy - new favorite Anime . Watching this makes up for Purfume : Story of a Killer's ending . 
I officially rule . :P 
Holiday World is tomorrow . Gosh , it's suppose to rain , and be very HOT . That's not a good combination . >.> 
Gave myself a heartattack . I sat my glasses down for a moment , then when I wanted them back , I forgot where I sat them . Long story short , I ended up sitting on them . But they didn't break ! I freakin LOVE these plastic frames . They've lasted me longer then any pair of glasses has : sunglasses and normal . And if they withstand me sitting on them , then they'll last me forever . lol 
I think I got up to early this morning . Feels like I've got a hangover . lol And dagnabit , it's raining again !!!! I love rain , but today , I wish it would just go away ... -_- 
Today at Holiday World was a blast . I can't remember the last time I had that much fun ... in the sun . LOL Unfortunely , being as abnoramaly pale as I am , I got a horrid sun burn-ouchie . lol And being as clumsy as I am , I even scrapped my knees up pretty good before we'd even been there twenty minutes . XD I even went in the pool-which I hate . But it wasn't so bad . 
Well , great day ruined kind of quickly . I check my mail to find an e-mail from my dad saying my aunt < PROPFEMALE > was in a car wreak . :( She broke a rib . But at least she didn't break her neck . 
Bones : Haha . < PROPMALE > and Booth highjack a body . I missed that last time . XD 
Sixty-fourth annual < PROPFIRST > Awards . GREEN DAY IS PLAYING . :D !!!!

Just got back from seeing Iron Man Two . It was awesome , as expected . AC/DC is an awesome band , and the music for the movie couldn't have been picked better . Mom and I were pratically laughing out of our seats through a lot of it . The effects were awesome as well . I really hope their will be a THIRD !! Woo ! :D I still can't believe it took us so long to see it . D: 
Bowling has failed us today ! D: It's a good thing the < PROPFIRST>'s hadn't been able to come , becuase it would have been awful to have come all the way from Salem for it to be closed . Still had fun , though !

Completely filling my wall full of quizzes . I can't help it ! I'M BORED AND HYPER ! Not a good combination when you are stuck in the house ! 
Just got done watching The End of Evangelion . OMG ! Shinji complains waaaaay to much . And I thought Renton from Eureka Seven was bad . At least Renton got better . 
HOLY CRAP ! I forgot my brother had my camera last . Turned it on and the first picture I see is of some boy making a really weird face . It's incredibly frightful . LOL 
Got to go do my two hours of typing , then bed . I need to write a new poem to make up for the horrid rhyming in that last one . I still can't believe nothing but < PROPFIRST > rhymes with promise . -_- 
Is exhausted . Had to clean the inside of Dollar General before we could close . Sweeping , mopping , dusting , cleaning windows , freezers , shelves , and the registers . 
Has to work a four to one shift tomorrow . D: < PROPMALE > busted his knee , so I'm working his shift . It's pretty much nothing but stocking , but damn , I have to get up at two , and I just got off work half and hour ago . All well , I love stocking . :3 
Two hours of sleep and a lot of caffeine was all I had keeping me going for my nine hour shift today . It was killer . I . Am . EXHAUSTED ! But at least I had an hour lunch . I think < PROPFEMALE > had it worse : she was main register , she didn't get to move around the whole store stocking like me . \ 
The only real bad thing about today was that my mom took off with my coffee when she dropped me off . D: I didn't get to finish it ... 
Guess who just dyed her hair black again ? MEH ! :D \ 
The red was starting to look a little to pink ... Now , if < PROPFEMALE > okay's it , I'm going with green strips . If not ... then red again ! 
Glade I don't work tomorrow . I'm still sore from two days of stocking . I don't think there is a muscle in my body that does not hurt . XO 
I has new wallet ! It has chains and skulls and it's black and it's awesome ! 
Got a new cell . Won't get it activated until tomorrow , though . It's kinda cooler then my last one . Still black , of course . ;D My number will stay the same , for those of you who have it , but if it changes , I'll let you know . 
Gets to < PROPFEMALE > out with her Besty Friday then has Monday off so I gets to take my Butter to his school thing . ;D 
Was gonna put green strips in her hair , but got shot down at work . D: All well , I knew I was , so I'ma just put my red ones back in . :D 
I need another story\ 
Something to get off my chest\ 
My life gets kinda boring\ 
Need something that I can confess\ 
' Til all my sleeves are stained red - Can't . Get . This . Song . Outa . My . Head ! 
Was gonna get my hair chopped off tomorrow , but the weather doesn't look like it'll be good . I might just have my aunt do it instead . I'll make her do it at home ... on her day off ... >:D

Guess who got off work half and hour early ? MEH ! Everyone was doing stocking , so I couldn't do my closing stuffs . I kinda wished they would have let me stay , I LOVE doing stocking . 
I got this really cool watch from someone I work with , now the only problem is ... it didn't come with a < PROPMALE > , so now I have no idea how to sent it ! I guess my life will always be an hour late ... 
Today at work was hell ... All the people that needed to do last minute shopping ... Tomorrow is suppose to be ten times worse ! GAH ! And I have to work eight hours tomorrow ... Here's hoping I survive and don't get eaten by M . J .. XD

So we didn't get out until nine , half and hour after we were actually suppose to , because the manager on shift did something very important and forgot to mention it to M.J. >.> And I didn't get home until about around nine-forty-five , making me miss my Church's Christmas program . > : @ 
Fourwheeler + truck hood + old fire hose = SNOW SLEDDING OF EPICNESS !

Like this status and I'll tell you what I like about you . 
Hello it's Me , I couldn't sleep , I was just counting sheep , \ 
And I'm missing you . \ 
Hello it's Me , I couldn't sleep , I was just counting sheep . 
You know me better than I know myself\ 
Better than anybody else\ 
Your love is sounding like a ringing bell\ 
Oh , oh , I won't let go 
If I could tell the world just one thing\ 
It would be that we're all OK\ 
And not to worry ' cause worry is wasteful\ 
And useless in times like these\ 
I won't be made useless\ 
I won't be idle with despair\ 
I will gather myself around my faith\ 
For light does the darkness most fear\ 
My hands are small , I know\ 
But they're not yours , they are my own\ 
And I am never broken 
I lie awake because I'm scared\ 
I'm not as fake as you once heard\ 
But we'll lay down now making sure we\ 
Put these words between us 
Does the world seem gray with empty longing\ 
Wearing every shade of cynical\ 
And do you ever feel that\ 
There is something missing ? \ 
That's my point of view ... 
Hello my friend\ 
I remember when you were\ 
So alive with your wide eyes to the light\ 
Then the light that you had when your heart was stolen\ 
Now you say that it ain’t worth stayin’\ 
You wanna run but your hesitatin’\ 
I’m talkin’ to me 
All my life I've been good but now , I'm thinking what the hell\ 
All I want is to mess around and I don't really care about\ 
If you love me , if you hate me , you can't save me , baby , baby\ 
All my life I've been good but now , whoa , what the hell\ 
What ... what ... what ... What the hell ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Hedges and me have discovered that I am a Puth . 
' I'm not weird , I'm limited edition . ' Dude , weird IS limited eddition . XD 
Was just in my first wreck driving . Everyone is okay , but it was so awful . I'm glade my mom didn't freak on me like I thought she would . 
All my life I've been good but now , whoa , what the hell

Please just let me wake up 
Got called by my boss . Got to go in today to fill in for someone who called in sick . One to ten-thirty-whoop . 
Has to start my exercising up again . D: I usually wait until spring , but since moms got the elliptical , I can do it inside . And she says this can replace my physical therapy , too . GOOD ! I hated going to therapy . XO\ 
One run on it and I'm already exhausted . Winter makes me so lazy . XD 
>.< My mother is pure evil . She gave me salad dressing with bacon in ti ! And I didn't know until after I'd already eaten some of it ! D: 
We were watching the A-Team and my mom was getting frustrated because the people were speaking Spanish and the subtitles were going by to quickly , she couldn't finish a single sentence , so she just suddenly shouted out ' my balls hurt!' AND OMG ! I actually though those were in the movie . ( I couldn't read the subtitles period because I can't read that far away D: ) We laughed . So . Hard . 
Who actually knows me ? I think NOBODY can answer all the questions correctly . \

I believe in Jesus Christ . One Facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . The Bible says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of My Father . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . 
Watching American Idol ... so glade I do not live in New Jersey . 
The worst is over now\ 
And we can breathe again\ 
I wanna hold you high you steal my pain away\ 
There's so much left to learn , and no one left to fight\ 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain 
Show me how it end it's alright\ 
Show me how defenseless you really are\ 
Satisfy an empty inside\ 
That's alright , let's give this another try 
Work was hell today . Three Venders AT ONE TIME ! OMFG ! TOO MUCH ! XO\ 
And < PROPFIRST > made the huges mess ... that I had to clean up . WHILE ON REGISTER ! D: \ 
<.< >.> 
I have made up a new way to curse . lol At work I can't , so I instead say ' crude apples/muffins ' and now my grandma is saying ! XD 
Wants to go out tomorrow but can't because of the snow . -_- 
I'm sinking slowly\ 
So hurry hold me\ 
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on\ 
Please can you tell me\ 
So I can finally see\ 
Where you go when you're gone 
I fought You for so long\ 
I should have let You in\ 
Oh how we regret those things we do\ 
And all I was trying to do was save my own skin\ 
But so were You\ 
So were You 
Found a hole that fill inside myself\ 
This emptiness by my own hand\ 
So constricted , self inflicted\ 
It's more than I can stand 
I know you feel alone yeah , and no one else can figure you out . \ 
But don't you ever turn away from the ones that help you down . \ 
Well they'd love to save you , don't you know they love to see you smile ? \ 
But these colors that you've shined , are surely not your style . \ 
But you should know these colors that you're shining are , \ 
Surely not the best colors that you shine . 
Somewhere there's speaking\ 
It's already coming in\ 
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind\ 
You never could get it\ 
Unless you were fed it\ 
Now you're here and you don't know why 
I spilt my chips . :( * cries * 
River < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > are facebook meanies . XD 
Well , I'm willing to break myself\ 
To shake this hell from everything I touch\ 
I'm willing to bleed for days my ... reds and grays\ 
So you don't hurt so much 
Is sick and feels like shit . 
* starts screaming*\ 
* stops screaming*\ 
\This means we're gonna die 
My mom says my new hair style looks like it's from the eighties . I can't decide if that's a good thing or not . XD 
Got myself a Rubik's Cube ! Whoo ! :D 
New ringtone ! Face Down by Red Jumpsuit Apparatus . My mom likes this one better because < PROPFIRST > Gontier is no longer screaming at her when someone calls me or texts . XD 
AC/DC One freakin ' awesome band ! :D 
Had to get up at five this morning , had to meet fellow workers at seven , ride for an hour in a very uncomfortable car , work seven hours , then ride BACK , switched spots in the car , so the ride was EVEN MORE uncomfortable . I'm exhausted . And I'll be doing the SAME thing every day of the week , ALL MONTH ! \ 
At least I got weekends off . This weekend I'm definitely going to spend it do somethin ' really fun . 
I ache so much . My legs hurt from all the bending and my arms hurt from all the lifting . Some of those shelves < PROPFIRST > and I had to take apart were HEAVY ! And we have to < PROPFEMALE > them up a flight of stairs ... \ 
That was the only awesome thing about today . THEIR STORE ROOM HAS AN UPSTAIRS ! Which of course became a little less awesome when I found out about the having to lift heavy things up them ... 
Did Dillsboro yesterday , Lawerenceburg today , Vevay tomorrow , and then Thursday we'll do New Washington . I can't wait to see what the store in Vevay looks like . 
Got all the way to Vevay and they didn't have power . After standing around freezing for half and hour , we got sent home . So we'll do Vevay Friday instead . New Washington is still tomorrow unless they don't have power either . 
What did I learn in Dillsboro's ? I love working with pegs . In Lawerenceburg ? I love taking isles apart and putting them together . Vevay ? Well , nothing yet ... lol\ 
In New Washington today I learned I really , really , really , really , really , really , hate doing toothbrushes . THEY WON'T STOP FALLING OFF THE PEGS , DAMN IT ! Up side , I hit < PROPFIRST > in the head with one . Purely by accident , of course . :P 
I was told I was good at what I do by the boss of all the Dollar Generals of < PROPFIRST > County and Jeffersoville county . Yay ! :D 
What I learned at Vevay today ? < PROPFIRST > sucks . All he does is get in my way when we work together . I work so much better with < PROPFEMALE > , because she works WITH me , not around me . 
Thirty-six hours of work in five days . I AM EXHAUSTED ! And I ache all over . That's the most I've worked in one week since I started working . But I love being on the Smart Team . It's so much fun ! 
Went to Hot Topic's and got myself a Bullet Four My < PROPFIRST > shirt , and talked to the guy working and now have the name of a great band . Their called Conditions . 
' The Day Everyone writes their favorite song on their arm with a sharpie :D ' - Fantastic idea , the only problem , my arms are so small , I don't think I can fit all the song lyrics to my favorite song on my arm . D: Can I use both arms ? 
Stargate Atlantis episode themed after CSI Las Vages ... OH ! THE HORROR ! \ 
But I gotta admit , that Wraith looked freakin ' awesome pretending to be human . XD 
What the hell ? I don't think I've done with one yet . \ 
Truth Is ... 
And I don't want you and I don't need you\ 
Don't bother to resist , or I'll beat you\ 
It's not your fault that you're always wrong\ 
The weak ones are there to justify the strong - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > creeps the hell out of me , but I love his music . XD 
Finished watching Futurama . Bender is my favorite ! Bite my shiny metal ass ! 
Sucks not being able to go to the first day of < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow , but work comes first . 
Oh , fudge apple . Did I just do that ? I think I did . XD 
Re-watching Stargate Atlantis . Something I noticed - why are all my favorite characters superficial asses ? 
Took my brother to see Tangled for his birthday . The movie wasn't that bad for a Disney . Dude , smolder ? That was just creepy . 
We got done so quickly with Versailles that we ended up doing Hanover today as well . I'm glade they didn't change to much in my store , because I like it the way it is . \ 
What did I learn in Versailles ? Apparently people with both an A and a Y in their names like to pick on me . < PROPFEMALE > sucks ! XD\ 
In Hanover ? I WANNA GO BACK TO MY STORE ! I MISS IT ! But I LOVE being on the Smart Team , it's so much fun . 
< PROPFEMALE > Guacohotwingbrowniepudding , you just gave me a freakin ' heart attack ! YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE ! 
We got done with < PROPFIRST > quicker then Verailles , which is good , because we decided to do Scottsburg as well , and that one ended up taking longer then we thought it would . \ 
Learned in < PROPFIRST > : Apparently EVERYONE likes to make a joke , have me comment , not knowing what the joke is , and then laugh at me . XD At least they let me in on the joke afterward . \ 
Scottsburg : < PROPFIRST > is much more of a joker then any of us thought . O.o 
I get tomorrow off ! YAY ! Would have been nice to know ahead of time so I wouldn't have had to cancel plans with my dad ... >.> 
I can't work with anyone on my team without getting hit . \ 
< PROPFIRST > likes to drop things on my fingers . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > knocks things onto my head . \ 
< PROPFIRST > throws things , misses her target , and almost always ends up hitting me . \ 
Alyica ... OMG ! She doesn't even do it by accident ! She just walks up behind me and hits me in the head with whatever she's holding ! I'm glade I haven't come across her while she's holding a shelf ... XD 
OMG ! I just realized that earlier , when I was texting my dad ... it wasn't my dad . It was < PROPFIRST > from work . And the weird part is , everything I said still made sense . XD 
Was going through some old pictures today . ( for class)\ 
Found some pictures of Chip and < PROPFIRST > from when they were just little pups . I miss them so much . \ 
Some of my Mokey from when she was just a little kitten . And now she's nine years old . \ 
Some with HIM in them . I wish I could burn those . \ 
And some from when I was more of a girl and liked wearing colors . Some of which are horribly girly . D: 
OMG ! Valentines Day is NOT A REAL HOLIDAY ! Please just STFU already . -_- 
Finally figured out how to do Facebook on my phone . 
We got done with North < PROPFIRST > early . Now we're heading to Greensburg and ... We're lost . LOL 
Yay ! We're not lost anymore ! 
Just finished Greensburg . OMG ! That manager was so rude . She must have had a stick up her ass . 
Soapy Joe's: what a stupidly funny name for a car wash . 
Yay ! My Disturbed wrist band came today from Hot Topics . 
Gonna be back at my store today . < PROPFEMALE > needs me for truck . Yay ! I miss my store and I love doing truck . 
Got to work to find out < PROPFEMALE > meant eight in the evening , not in the morning . LOL 
I get to work in Salem again next week . Not sure which day , yet , though . Charlestown is first , Monday . Gonna get a new captain on our team , too . 
Well ... truck didn't come in , so I'm not working tonight . Instead , I'm going to be doing a night shift tomorrow . So I can still go to the movies with < PROPFEMALE > dad . :D 
My poor little cousin was in an accident . Had to get four stiches . 
Just got out of the movies : The Rite is a good movie . My dad fell asleep . XD 
Had to go to work right after the movies , way earlier then I was originally suppose to , but MJ needed my help . So I ended up working over ten hours . I love truck shifts , especially when their at night . 
( Re : ) TIPS 
Just got home from working at Charlestown . OMG ! That store is such a mess . It took us the whole day instead of only a half . And it was worse then Larweneceburg ! I AM SO TIRED ! XO 
Had my first Monster today , mainly because Shaine wouldn't shut up about me never having had one . They taste like a really nasty flavored cool-aid . But if you keep drinking it , you get used to the flavor and it doesn't taste so bad . But it made me so hyper at work , < PROPFEMALE > said I'm not allowed to have one anymore . XD 
Got my fishnet gloves today . They're even better then I thought they'd be . 
The whole world's scared , so I swallow the fear\ 
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer\ 
So cool in line and we try try try but we try too hard\ 
And it's a waste of my time . \ 
Done looking for the critics , cause they're everywhere\ 
They don't like my jeans , they don't get my hair\ 
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time\ 
Why do we do that , why do I do that ( why do I do that) ? 
Yay ! I might be able to go to class next Monday , since our schedules got all screwed up . :D 
All those pages that list things kids have done ... come on , what's the point in listing them and saying like it if you've done one of those , WE'VE ALL DONE THEM AT LEAST ONCE ! And if you say you haven't , you're a big fat liar ! XD 
Why do people you dislike , and that dislike you back , give you valentines ? :/ 
Fuck my fuckin ' phone . > : @ 
I'm so mad right now . Why are people so fucking stupid ? >:/ 
This is OBVIOUSLY national ' everyone be stupid week ' , they just forgot to tell us . 
Okay , so now it's stocking in < PROPFIRST > tomorrow , and maybe stocking in Salem Friday . O.M.G. < PROPFIRST > , PLEASE make up your mind ! No more calls at eight in the morning making schedule changes ! 
Okay , so Batesville tomorrow ! < PROPFIRST > was ... that store REALLY NEEDS TO BE CLEANED ! The people that stock there must have no idea what they are doing . < PROPFIRST > and I had to redo almost all the HBA . 
Just found out Batesville is two hours away . In a car with < PROPFIRST > for two hours ... I'm bored to tears just thinking about it . XO 
We pass so many church signs-lets see who has the best . 
Frist sign : ' In God we trust with all our hearts . ' 
Second sign : ' God is our shepord . ' ( omg ! They spelled shepherd wrong on their sign ! ) 
I just noticed - I update my status more when I'm bored or hyper . AND I'M BOTH RIGHT NOW ! While I'm stuck in a car for two hours ... X@ 
Toys is all we have left to do . We'd be done if < PROPFIRST > had come . :| 
Yay ! We're done ! I hate toys , hope they burn , AND I AM NEVER GETTING UP AT FOUR IN THE MORNING AGAIN . Take that you stupid two hour drive . 
I'm sorry , so what ! \ 
But you don't think I've said enough\ 
I'm sorry , I don't care ! \ 
You were never there 
OMG ! My new manager , < PROPFEMALE > , put me on the schedule and didn't even tell me . She knows damn well I'm out all week with the Smart Team and have no way of knowing ! She didn't even put it to herself to call me ! That just pisses me off so much . I already don't like her . I want < PROPFEMALE > back ! 
So it's all good . My store , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , Salem , Salem . Whooooo ! lol 
Seven to ten - oddest hours ever ! Stupid truck ... 
My brother walked in wearing my mothers classes and holding a banana to his nose ... the first thing I shouted was ' Oi , he's a Jew!' Made my mom and brother laugh so hard . XD Redo of a classic Family Guy moment . 
Whooo hooo ! I get to go to school Monday . :D 
I HAS COOKIES ! Jealous ? MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! \ 
Oh , yeah , I'm hyper , I had another MONSTER ! \ 
But shhh , don't tell < PROPFEMALE > . XD 
Fuck . Figures this would happen to me now . The pessimist in me is pissed off , but the optimist in me is so fuckin ' happy . Guess who's winning ? :| 
Goin ' to Clarksville , but gotta rush because I have to be at work by four . XO 
Fuckin ' Perfect by P ! nk . Best song this year .

Bwahahaha ! I is at Hot Topic . ;D 
OMG ! < PROPFEMALE > says me wearing my collar up makes me look like I came from the eighties . XD I DON'T CARE ! I like wearing my collar up . :P 
A conversation I just had with my mom :\ 
' Me : Mom , you suck . \ 
Her : Yes , I've been told that . \ 
Me : Ew , mom . ' \ 
I don't think I'll ever be able to do THAT ' that's what she said ' joke ever again . XO 
Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall\

I love working on the Smart Team , but these hours have been keepin ' me so busy I haven ' been able to keep up with what's happenin ' with my friends , and it's drivin ' me crazy . I can't wait to go back to my store so that I can start stayin ' updated with my friends .

I was in a fuck you mood , so I listened to Blink-182 . Then I was in a calm , ' I hate you mood ' , so I listened to Evanescence . Then , outa nowhere , I was in a freaky mood , so I listened to Bowling For Soup . XD 
Guess who's getting a black eye ? And no , it's not from fighting like one would think , and prefer to get one from . I got it from work . From dropping a fucking box on my face . A douche , no less .

Cleaning my room . :D 
In Clarksville meeting my mom for dinner . Might be getting my new phone today . 
Forgot to get paint today . D: No painting my closet black this week . 
Oh , I read that and laughed so hard . Mostly becaues I was thinking the same thing . You just gotta love the weird ones . 
Everyone has their own opinion and can say them if they want . If that makes them a jerk becaues you don't agree , then odviously you're a bigger bitch then I would have ever thought possible . 
Aw , fucking hell . Just cut my finger open again . -.- 
Sore , sore , and more sore . My finger stopped bleeding , but then < PROPFEMALE > stepped on my hand . -.- I had three large toys dropped on my head , gave me the biggest headache , my knees hurt from all the kneeling , and < PROPFIRST > backed into me with a stool . And no < PROPFIRST > . :( 
I have to be at work a little before seven tomorrow . Which means I have to be in bed even earlier . Crap , crap . 
I am never counting books again . Going through , finding and matching , all those sku < PROPFIRST > was hell . And very boring . 
Got paint , so going to start painting my closet sometime tonight . 
This is fuckin ' torture . Every minute we spend together is making me miserable , and you don't even know . And I can't tell you . 
Tonight was awful . And now I get to do it every week . Oh , joy . 
Going to get tile for my closet , and my new phone . 
Your such a fuckin ' hypocrite . 
GOT MY NEW PHONE ! It's so fuckin ' awesome ! 
STOP IT ! You just ruined my buzz . 
I love my new phone ! :D 
Goin ' to go paint . Listenin ' to < PROPFEMALE > and Eminem . Great paintin ' music . :D 
Today , at work , this guy came up behind me and said ' sir , could you show me where your light bulbs are ? ' I turned around and gave him the meanest glare I could , like what he had said had bothered me , and he just slowly walked away . LOL I love making people feel awkward . XD 
Back to paintin ' . 
Okay . Sent my new number out to everyone . Let me know if you didn't get it . 
OMG , OMG , the new House looked so cool ! I think I'm hyperventilating ! XD 
It's boring waiting . 
OMG ! Forgot my computer cord at home . And < PROPFIRST>'s cord won't work on mine ! D: BATTRTY . ALMOST . DEAD ! 
Oh , damn . I left my homework at home . -.- 
It`s amazing . It seems I forgot everything this morning . I`m surprised I didn`t forget my phone . 
River and < PROPFIRST > sittin ' in a tree , they are KISSIN ' . 
Writing class today was very excelent . Lot to do , lot to think about . 
OMG , what is with the little kids ! It's getting crowded . 
< PROPFIRST>'s hat is a gay umbrella apperently . XD 
I CAN HAVE MUSIC ON THIS PHONE ! Now to just figure out how to get it on here . XO 
Damn right I'm a nerd ! And damn proud of it . So :P . 
I want to see Red Riding Hood this weekend , I've been waiting for it to come out ! It looks so awesome ! 
If you hurt my brothers feelings again , I swear , I will give you hell . \ 
So you better think hard before you go and open your fuckin ' mouth again . 
I HAS PEEPS ! :D 
My dad is trying to be hip ... It's not working . XD It just makes me laugh to read his texts . 
Gah ! I went and finished my second part of writing , now I want to change it . :( I can't decide if it's worth it or not ... I might do both and decide which is better ... 
Having to switch everything from my old phone number to my new one is so annoying . >.< 
After completely cutting yourself off from someone important to you for months , can you really just expect to come back into their lives without problems ? \ 
No , you can't . \ 
I wish things could be different . 
Meeting my mom for lunch . Hope I don't get lost . I've never driven there myself . Lol 
I hurt my hand on my stupid truck . >.< Apparently my truck has some kind of vendetta against me , because this is not the first time . lol 
The tragedy it seems I'm ending\ 
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending\ 
We're taking shortcuts and false illusions\ 
Just to come out the hero 
Seeing that message made me so happy . I didn't you could do that to me . 
Three days ' till Red Riding Hood ! Whoo ! :D 
Need to go to bed for tomorrow , but waaaaay to hyper . OMG ! 
Got to go to Dillsboro again today . Have no idea what we are going to be doing , though . :/ 
These :) do not make everything okay . So stop using them when i'm mad . >.> 
Almost got lost there ... Lol SAM'S DRIVIN ' FRIGHTENS ME ! XD 
Dillsboro sucks . :/ 
I hate < PROPFIRST > so much . We have been here like five times . It's awful here . 
Holy crap ... That scared the shit outta me ... 
Wants to go to the movies so badly this weekend , but can't find any times for the movie I want to see . :/ 
If I have to go back to < PROPFIRST > one more time within the next year , I'm going to go insane and blow the place up . KEEP IT CLEAN THIS TIME PEOPLE ! We're not always going to come to your rescue when you get yourselves in deep shit . 
Brings up memories . Painful memories . \ 
Who knew writing a story could do that . 
 ? $Msg < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > OMG ! < PROPFIRST > said something about stroganoff , and I thought he said jerking off and I was laughing so hard I was hypervetallating . \ 
... and 
 ? $ he still thinks I'm gay . Dx 
OMG ! Hit in the head by a bag of noodles is not pleast . But it was kinda funny . Thanks ever so much < PROPFIRST > . XD 
Oh . That was hell . I'm so tired . And I ache everywhere . Especially where < PROPFIRST > dropped a box on my head . XO 
Oh , great . I certain someone found out about a certain something and she won't keep her mouth shut . This sucks . >.> 
Wheather outside is soooo nice . :D 
My mom and I passed a guy giving his son a piggyback ride and my mom said , oh-so-casually , ' I wonder if he'd give me a ride . ' \ 
XDDDD\ 
I blame < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > for every thought that went through my mind at that moment . 
I was just trying to be myself\ 
You go your way I'll meet you in hell\ 
It's all these secrets that I shouldn't tell\ 
I've got to run away\ 
It's hypocritical of you\ 
Do as you say not as you do\ 
I'll never be your perfect girl\ 
I've got to run away 
I can't wait for shorts season . :D 
I wanna see Red Riding Hood again already ! It was soooo good . It had better come out on DVD very quickly or I'ma be very pissed off ! >.> :D 
Stayed up way to late last night . Do not want to work this early . XO 
Playing a word game and a word starting in smart came up :\ 
Smartass ? Smartass ? :D \ 
Smartness . \ 
OH , SCREW YOU ! 
We're already almost done . D: YAY ! Lol But < PROPFEMALE > said she'd find something for us to do to fil up those last three hours . :P 
Finally off work . So freakin ' tired . XO 
Okay , people . Taunting me with meat does NOT make me want to eat it . It makes me nauseous . So unless you want me to < PROPMALE > on your shoes , fuck off . >.> 
My ankle still hurts , my knees hurt , and my fingers hurt . Over night stocking is going to kill me . XO 
Ended up skippin ' school . Feeling both physically and emotiolly drained . Not a good combination . I'm feeling quiet sick . 
Feeling better then I did this morning . I guess I just needed some alone time . I spent all weekend in to much company and didn't get enough sleep because of it . 
I can't tag people when I'm posting with my phone . D: Screw you , Facebook . >.> 
Taking my brother to get his hair cut . Man , I feel like his mom . XO 
I feel like I've just been stabbed , and the knife keeps digging in deeper , and deeper . \ 
And it's never going to come out . 
I don't care about a lot of things , \ 
But your opinion was one of the few things I did care about . \ 
And you knew that . \ 
If you were trying to hurt me , then congratulations , \ 
You succeeded . 
Stayed up to late , slept in to late , now I have a sleep headache and just feel like moping around . -.- 
On the first < PROPFEMALE > of our story\ 
The future seemed so bright\ 
Then this thing turned out so evil\ 
I don’t know why I’m still surprised\ 
Even angels have their wicked schemes\ 
And you take that to new extremes\ 
But you’ll always be my hero\ 
Even though you’ve lost your mind 
Got an all day shift at my store today . And of all days , it's when She's working . 
Just now taking lunch , we were on a roll . I'm so tired of moving shelves . They weigh so much , and we didn't take much off before the move . 
Finally off work and going to Wal-Mart with my dad and brother . 
Have to be at work tomorrow at six . D: Then I have an all-nighter to pull at my store Friday . :D Then I might end up working in New Washington the morning of my all-nighter . D: D I'll end up working twenty hours in a twenty-four hour period . I'll have only two hours between each shift , so I probably won't be doing anything but sleeping Friday . XD 
He senses something , call it desperation\ 
Another dollar , another day\ 
And if she had the proper words to say , \ 
She would tell him\ 
But she'd have nothing left to sell him 
And just fake it , if you're out of direction\ 
Fake it , if you don't belong here\ 
Fake it , if you feel like infection\ 
Woah , You're such a fuckin ' hypocrite 
Freaked out ' cause I couldn ' find my keys . Turns out I put them in the wrong pocket . lol I'm so out of it right now , but I got me a Monster , so bring on today . 
After today , I won't care if I ever have to see your face again . 
I'm in fucking misery right now . Last time I work a eleven-plus hour shifts without wearing my braces . My knees feel like they are being ripped in half . And my ankle is so swollen . XO 
You won't recognize me\ 
I'm not who I used to be\ 
I've been turned inside-out and thrown away 
Yes , I am in the middle of writing a new poem , so you will be getting a lot of statuses from me that will probably rhyme . XD 
' < PROPFEMALE > , my turn , because I'm gonna be a total copy cat . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > :P \ 
Truth is ... 
Up since six , and I made it all the way to four . I could have gone longer if I hadn't worked so much today . 
Getting ready to start my all-nighter stocking . Whoo ! :D 
I never thought my opinion of someone I liked could drop so easily . But what you're doing , you're doing it for the wrong reason , so I don't think I could ever feel the same about you . 
So ... The seven-hundred-fifty miunte monthy plan only lasts me twelve days . Lol I think I use my phone to much . So I'll have to go for the unlimited plan . XD 
Wow ... Goin ' through my saved messages . Apperently my butt tried texting someone while I was workin ' . LOL 
\Being happy doesn't mean everything is perfect . It means you've decided to see beyond the imperfection . \ " - unknown " 
Conversation with my two-year-old cousin . \ 
\Are you going to eat your sandwich ? \ " \ 
I'm stuck . -.- How do you rhyme a big word like unassuming ? :/ 
Rockin ' out to Disturbed , because they are just that awesome . ;D 
Told my mom I'm gettin ' high on Yahoo ! and donuts ... And she thought I said hoe . XD 
It's my cousin C . J . ' s birthday today . He's eighteen , so now I get to kick his butt eighteen times . >:D 
Everything about me seemed so much different when I was young\ 
I couldn't wait to take my place\ 
Five years have passed\ 
Good god have I been gone ? \ 
So why , I've never felt so alone in my whole life\ 
Times not on my side\ 
I'm holding on to a fairytale\ 
We're moving forward but we're not there yet\ 
We're moving forward\ 
we're moving forward 
Somebody give me a sign\ 
That everything is going as planned , \ 
And then everything falls away\ 
Into the darkness of this shallow place . \ 
The detail is striking , \ 
The rooms cold and frightening\ 
You'll kick and you'll scream , \ 
You'll try everything to survive , \ 
But you should know your fate by now . 
You can't shut up , can you ? \ 
I . DON'T . CARE ! \ 
So leave me alone . >.> 
Is really not ready for school tomorrow . I've had enough time to get just a few lines of my homework done . Been way to busy this week . XO 
I never knew\ 
I never knew that everythin ' was fallin ' through\ 
That everyone I knew was waitin ' on a cue\ 
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth\ 
But that's how it's gotta be\ 
It's comin ' down to nothin ' more than apathy\ 
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see\ 
The smoke and who's still standin ' when it clears 
When I die , I want you to bury me upside down , so the world can kiss my ass . 
Left my stupid GED book at home and had to go back . At least I didn't get that far . >.> 
I'm still half asleep . I knew I shouldn't have slept in . XO 
Has to work after school . -.- 
I'm sick . -.- 
Oh , my gosh , coke tabs . COKE TABS . Maybe not ... :P 
Forgot my head phones at home and I'm pretty sure the parents all wil shit a cow if they listened to Disturbed . 
You know , I just realized you are an Emo . A retarded one at that . :D 
I am not afraid to keep on living\ 
I am not afraid to walk this world alone\ 
< PROPFEMALE > if you stay , I'll be forgiven\ 
Nothinf you could say can stop me going home 
That's it . You . Are . Dead . Next time I see you , you are fuckin ' in for it , bitch . 
Is heading to work . 
If she takes the key , I quit . I don't care if it's runing away , that women is unbearable , even for me . 
Off work and heading home . I love driving at night . 
Deal with it , because I'm not going to apologize for being right . :D 
Taught my mom to text , now she sends me weird ones . XD 
I had my phone in my back pocket while I was at work , and apparently my butt tried callin ' someone . And then < PROPMALE > up on them . Didn ' make ' em to happy . XD 
The writings on the wall , you've read that I'll be gone , but if you call my name\ 
Just know that I'll come running , for one more night to spare with you\ 
This is where I'm meant to be , please don't leave me\ 
I walked into your house this morning\ 
I brought the gun from our end table\ 
Your blood was strewn across the walls\ 
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done 
I sneezed fifty-three times today . Yes , I counted . :P 
Well , that completely blew my plans for today . D: 
Welp , taking a trip to < PROPFEMALE > instead . 
Got called a dude again by a cashier in Wal-Mart . XD 
I'm booooooooored . -.- 
Run like hell\ 
Sleep with one eye open\ 
You can't forgive or forget\ 
Tell everyone the damage done\ 
Too bad you can't stop me\ 
You can't stop me now\ 
Don't blink\ 
They won't even miss you at all\ 
And don't think\ 
That I'll always be gone\ 
There I go again\ 
I mean its so damn hard\ 
To come back from the mess that you made\ 
I really don't know\ 
I told you so\ 
I'll be there just to watch you fall\ 
Don't push me\ 
I got nothing to lose 
The state of the nation , violation\ 
A broken promise is as good as a lie\ 
The hell is humongous , the devil's among us\ 
And we will burn because we won't unite 
Gots to go back to North < PROPFIRST > tomorrow . D: 
Me and her stuck on a car together for an hour ... Oh joy . >.> 
My phone won't let me get offline . D: 
In with her less then ten and she's already getting on my nerves . 
We are soooo lost . XD 
Holy crap . This store is awful . And < PROPFIRST > is gonna be here in a few hours , too . XO 
Tammy`s driving equals : AAAAAAAAAHHHH ! XD 
Looks like everyone but North < PROPFIRST > got bad wheather . All wel , headin ' home , so we'll be in it son if it's still bad . 
I'm getting lechured on what I say by you , \ 
And you're the town slut . \ 
Something doesn't seem right with this . 
Wow . That was sad . \ 
Part of me feels sorry for you , \ 
But the other part can't get over how you've treated my friend , \ 
And how much of a hypocritical , judgmental , bitch you are . \ 
So yeah , we're still never going to be friends . :D 
I'm in a creative mood . 
I is a Tweester now . 
My room is so close to being done . Yay ! 
It's cold . I want the warmth back . :( 
Gots to go to < PROPFEMALE > today and get more wood . 
You can go flappersnaps yourself . :) 
Halfway to Scottsburg , my brother suddenly tells me that we're suppose to be going to Charlstown . \ 
Stupid brother . >.> 
This Saturday is offically going to be epic . 
Got me a Blue Monster . I'm so addicted . XD

And I'm having the oddest girly moments lately . O.o \

I'm awake and I'm alive\ 
Waking up 
Apperently I drive a lot faster then < PROPFEMALE > , becasue I got here twenty minutes earlier then her when she was driving last week . 
This is just one of those moments where you want to blow up and shout ' fuck you ' and leave the room . 
All those people goin ' somewhere\ 
Give me your eyes for just one second\ 
Yeah 
FOOD ! OMFG ! We finally get to eat . 
Finally got my Facebook app to work . It`s really cool .

And once again ... FOOD ! Lunch time . :3

Instead I'll just piss her off . Revenge enough . 
Messages ... Won't ... Load ... GAH ! 
Freaked out for a moment because I couldn't find my phone cord . COME ON ! I need to put my new ring tone on . XD 
So wants to go out and get a movie . >:D

Didn't get anyone today . But < PROPFIRST > was the only one who got me . : X And it was such a lame joke anyone would have fallen for it . XD 
Six hours ' till I have to be back at work . Sleep , or not to sleep . That is the question . lol 
So didn't get aby sleep , and now I feel like hitting something . 
Beatin ' up chemical cardboard at work . ;D 
Gots to drop some stuff off at New Washington for work , then off to < PROPFEMALE>'s for hair dye . 
Lack of sleep has turned me into a bitch . Going to dye my hair , then get in bed and never get out !! \ 
Oh wait ... Work tomorrow . Doh ! XD 
panicked there for a moment . The dye went on purple . Lol But it didn`t stay purple . I`d rather shave my head again then have purple hair again . XP 
Woo . Got to sleep for eight hours to make up for yesterday . Lol I feek energized . XD 
Has a huge headache from listening to my brother bitch . >.< 
Today with the bestie was fantastic . WE PICKED UP CHICKS ! \ 
No , literaly . We picked up baby chicks . XD 
In such a bad mood today . I feel sick . Batesville , here I come . -.- 
I feel about ready to pass out . I'm so tired . 
This is just one of THOSE days , where you ache , you're cranky , and the next person who pisses me of is going to get a fist to the face . 
Like this status and I will confess something . 
To Monday : Fuck you . You`re just a screw up day that fucks with everyone . So go die . 
Tammy : Couch and chair do not mean the same ! \ 
Me : Of course not ! I sit on my table and eat on my chair ! I'm not crazy ! \ 
- I totally am . ;D 
Trust me , you're the only unbelievable thing here . \ 
And not in a good way . 
For the first time in months , I get to work at my store tomorrow doing something other then stocking . 
I really can't wait for today to be over . 
Today at work is flying by so fast . It's hard to believe I've been here for only three and a half hours . Lol Two and a half more to go ! 
Listening to M.J. play her game on her phone is so funny . She curses like every other word . LOL 
So bored . >.< 
I just noticed I'm not wearing any black . Lol 
< PROPFIRST > didn't say anything about my hair , and < PROPFEMALE > said she liked it , so I get to keep it . Yay ! 
Cleaned my Grandma's gutters for her today . Pissed a few wasps off , got stung a few times . \ 
Pain for a few seconds verses dying ? Who got the better deal ? Lol 
The only inappropriate thing about this mess is you . So back the fuck off my brother before I make you . 
The Hipitty Hop - I could really get into that . XD 
So not ready for tomorrow . Got to babysit my two-year-old cousin . I've never actually had to watch after a little kid by myself . 
Pre-midnight snackage - PUDDING ! :D 
I'm Sporing , man ! XD 
She's making me dance ! AAAAAAAAHHHHH ! 
That's how I should have known it wasn't Veggy Tales - they have HANDS ! 
Finally done babysitting . Her dad came home eariler then I thought he would . I thought I'd be there ' till at least six . Lol 
Be happy all you want but youve given me a damn good reason not to like you . So shove that up your ass\ 
Sorry , you probably dont have room with that stick there . 
Do you want come cake ? We have some cake ? \ 
Oh , wait ... We don't have any cake ... \ 
Hmm ... \ 
Hey , are you selling cake ?! 
Over-night stocking , HERE I COME ! :D 
When someone flicks me off , why are they so shocked when I flick them off back ? XD 
OMG ! I'M HYPERVENTALLATING - THAT WAS SO FREAKIN ' FUNNY ! XD 
Dropped another box on my face - ouch . >.> 
When I`ve finally had enough , I`m just going to say it , throw it out there , see what happens . You`ll probably ignore me , even hate me , but either way , I won`t care . Just to say it will make up for anythin` . 
Whooo , only got four and a half hours of sleep . Go movies . -.- 
Yeah , just pretend you're a good little girl\ 
Even though they know it's a lie\ 
Just pretend and fake it\ 
They don't care\ 
It's a lie and they'll take it 
Love the rain , but hate it when you're driving and can't see more then two fucking feet in front of you . 
Wow ... Tree in the road . Almost didn't see it . \ 
And now it's hailing ... \ 
Who's idea was it to go to the movies again ? 
In such a bad mood . \ 
Come on , someone give me a reason to be in a good mood . \ 
I need it . 
GREEN LANTER ! I must see . 
Rango was really good . Just don't watch it when you're as tired as me . I think I fell asleep for a few minutes . LOL 
I think I did pretty good today , for being in such a bad mood . I only told one person to piss off . And that was only because she deserved it . 
A veggy-head and horror movie lover ? I thought I was the only one around here . \ 
I must meet this girl ! 
Sing it for everyone you left behind\ 
Sing it for the world\ 
You've got to be what tomorrow needs 
< PROPFEMALE > and I are re-doin the pop wall ! Takin everythin off and puttin it back on is horrible\ 
Joke inspired by todays activity :\ 
< PROPFEMALE > and I have a coke problem ;D 
God help my brother . Mikey has to be put down . 
So don't want to go to Batesville tomorrow . Her and inventory plus getting up at four o'clock in the morning are a great combination for a bad day . 
I . Hate . Mondays . \ 
I'd rather go back to bed instead . \ 
All well . Get to annoy you again , don't I ? :D 
Holy crap . It's gonna storm on us again . \ 
I offically hate Batesville . 
Yep , it's raining . So hard we can barley see the road . 
I'm so tired , I flinched when I thought something was about to fall on my head . I looked up and nothing was there . Going crazy ? No , I'm already crazy . XD 
I like the new girl . She`s replacing < PROPFIRST > on the Smart Team from Charlestown . She`s nice , AND not a bitch like a certain someone else on the team . 
When you think life can't fuck you over anymore , it surprises you . 
You don't interest me ... But your hair does . \ 
I love spiked hair , doesn't matter if some self-obsessed prick is wearing it . \ 
And no , it doesn't make you cool . :D 
That monster terrorized me when I was a little girl . I still have scars from him . \ 
And I can't believe I actually miss him . 
Gonna go take my G.E.D. Wednesday and Thursday . Whoop ! \ 
Dear God , please let me pass . 
I wish I could like messages , BECAUSE I WOULD SO LIKE THAT ! 
If you're trying to impress me with your little stories , it's not workin you dumb slut . \ 
So go tell them to someone who actually cares to listen to your shit . :D 
Jeffersonville is one fucked up place . And the people that live here are worse . 
I'm starting the count down\ 
I've got about a minute to wait\ 
Give me some bad news\ 
Just tell me how it feels\ 
To fake it\ 
Just your badest mistake 
You put a dog to sleep because he didn't get along with other dogs ? Well fuck you bitch . \ 
People don't get along with you , does that mean I can put you down ? 
This is such a headache . >.< 
Well , turns out I can't get my G.E.D. at < PROPFEMALE > Tech . They quit givin it . Pffft . \ 
So now I gotta try and find someplace else . -.- \ 
Fuck this shit . 
I may be careless\ 
I may not care about a lot of things\ 
But that is one thing I could never\ 
Because that is one thing I do care about 
Well , we buried Mikey today . 
Showing my brother how to drive my truck . OMG , THIS WAS A BAD IDEA ! His driving freaks me out . Lol 
Aaaaah ! My brother just farted in my poor Smokey's face . D: 
It needs to be June , NAO ! :D 
It's funny when you're listening to music and then you turn your radio off ... Only to remember you were listening to your phone . XD 
Havin ' lunch with my mom today . Almost thought I was because I couldn't find my keys . Lol 
I just realized I have about seven messages from people I didn`t even know I had . O.o 
Since I can't take my G.E.D. tomorrow , looks like I'm working in Salem . 
Riding with my papa on his backhoe is so much fun , especially in the bucket . 
I hate how all the music on my phone suddenly doesn't want to play anymore . >.< 
The new girl at my store gets to come with me for Smart Team tomorrow . Not sure why , but the more we have , the quicker we'll get done . ;D 
Aaaaand ... Now the new girl isn't coming . What the fuck ? >.> 
Another bad night . Only got like two hours of sleep . 
Heading out to work . Holy crap it's cold . >.< \ 
Warm up fast , please ! 
Ew . XP There's a bug in my coffee . Now I have no coffee . I'm sad . :( 
Whoops . Got here a little to early . XD 
Today turned my whole week around . Hanging with the bestie was fantastic . :DD 
The music on my phone is working again ! My dad is the awesomest . :D 
Freefall all through life\ 
I wont be held down by who I used to be\ 
She's nothing to me\ 
Feels like all my screaming has gone unheard\ 
I know you dont believe in me 
Havin ' pizza and watchin ' a movie with my dad and brother before work tonight . 
Me : I don't know who this Mattiew is , but I'd really like to kick him in the balls . Can I kick him in the balls ? \ 
Amber : Go ahead . 
< PROPFIRST > took my stickers and hide them . I would really like to kick him in the balls right now . >.< 
That was awful . \ 
I keep trying to convince myself that ... But it's not working . \ 
There's no way I'm sleeping tonight . 
Wow ... All I've got to say is BWAHAHAHAHAHA ! You're dreamin ' bitch . 
Playing Halo with my brother . \ 
Me : I see a vending mechine ! \ 
Robert : I have some spare change . \ 
Me : Good , get me a klondic bar . 
Robert : I get three lives for every Elite I kill . \ 
Me : I know I'm an Elite ... But does that count for me , too ? \ 
Robert : What'd you do ? \ 
Me : I think I ran one over . 
Three things I learned today . 1 . I hate being an insomniac . 2 . All this time awake makes me think about the past ... 3 . You really need to shut the fuck up and back off , bitch . 
I don't believe in love , but sometimes I wish I did . 
Holy crap . It's cold . It's . Cold . XO 
It literally feels like a lifetime ago\ 
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday , though\ 
You can kiss my indecisive ass 
Whoop . I am waaaaay to slap-happy for this early in the day . XD And I'm here ' till three ! 
It's so ironic . I have school in Salem tomorrow , and that's the same day I actually have to work in Salem . XD 
Who I am hates who I`ve been . 
Okay ... So I have no service ... Yet it's still letting me send and get stuff . O.o \ 
This is screwed up , but at the same time ... Totally awesome . XD 
To Monday Bitch , \ 
I just wanted to say that\ 
You can kiss my ass . :D \ 
Sincerely , \ 
A Girl You Don't Fool 
I am in such a fantastic mood today . \ 
And I'm not going to let you ruin that by pissin ' me off . :D 
I'm going to be sick . \ 
You two are so utterly , ridiculously stupid . \ 
Makes me want to laugh so hard . 
Five songs that would make a perfect playlist for me :\ 
Dimaond Eyes\ 
Riot\ 
Last Train Home\ 
Please Don't Let Me Go\ 
Who I Am Hates Who I've Been

Fifth tornado warning text I`ve gotten in the past five minutes . Yeah , I think I understood the first time . >.> 
You're an adult . You can fuck up all you want , I don't care . \ 
The only thing I do care about is that you had the gull to look me in the eyes and lie to me . 
SMC , people . 
Rehab taste like Brisk . 
Blaring Blue October in the house equals one epic day . 
I just dropped a vaccum on my head . >.< 
So drill it , so drill it , so hard\ 
I feel it 
I just did something completely random and unlike me . XD 
While I was busy waging wars on myself , you were trying to stop the fight\ 
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate\ 
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take\ 
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind\ 
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind 
How can I heal\ 
When you won't even feel\ 
Why don't you hate me ? 
Me : I finally decided where I want my lip ring . \ 
Mom : Up your ass ? \ 
Me : HOW DID YOU KNOW ? XDD 
You may become many things ... But a cool frat dude is not one of them . :P 
If Trump becomes president , trust me , I'll shoot myself . \ 
That douch would doom us all worse then we already are . \ 
So shut the fuck up . \ 
Go to hell . \ 
And GOODNIGHT ! 
Watchin ' the Furgmister . \

Riding with < PROPFIRST > is always so much fun . XD 
Today`s a day of friending . I`m just going to go around and friend a bunch of random people just to weird them out . LOL And suggestions ? 
I am going to strangle that bitch if she don't shut the fuck up . >.< 
I swear , riding with < PROPFIRST > Neace is gonna make me go deaf . But it`s still so awesome blaring loud rap music . :D 
Feels weird to be getting ready for an Easter progrem on Friday instead of work . Lol

Staying up all night is ... I'm uber bored . -.- 
Uge . With the weather my mom keeps tryin to talk me into her drivin me to work , but I've gotten so independent drivin I can't stand to be hauled around anymore . 
I . Hate . Driving . My . Mom's . Car . >.> \

Just wrote a letter for the bestie . lol Almost a thousand words , NOT EVEN KIDDING ! There was just so much stuff I forget to tell her over the phone , and stuffs I forgot to ask . LOL 
Women : Is it real ? \ 
Me : What ? \ 
Me : Is what real ? \ 
Women : Your tattoo . \ 
Me : OHMYGOSH . I forgot all about that . XDDD I wish it were . 
I wish I could have taken away all Your pain\

I wish I could have taken away everything hurtful they did to You\ 
But most of all\ 
I wish You didn't have to die for my sins\ 
But I thank You everyday for saving me\ 
Happy Easter . 
Today just needs to go away . 
Are you an idiot ? Really ? Why don't you just shut up already ? 
Stupid slut , you are going to kill that poor little thing . 
Say something like that to me again , and I will not be sorry for my actions or words . 
Both you Monday Bitches can go to hell . \ 
I'ma go write the bestie another letter to calm myself down . I'm going to write her one a day , then she'll get them and be like ' OHMYGOSHSHUTUP . ' XD 
Type what you really say then delete it ? NEVER . If I want to say something , I don`t care if it wil bother other people , I`m damn well going to say it . 
Me : ' pokes mom'\

I need to calm down ? Bitch , you need to fuck off and stay out of other peoples business . 
I need to blow off some steam right now , or I might do something you and I both will regret . Like press that send button . 
I love how you're not only a liar , but a hypocrite . :) 
I can speak bitch to , but they won't let me add that one . lol 
I am no longer tryin to survive\ 
But to live doesn't mean you're alive\ 
Doin target practice all these bitches just aim to please\

Shout out to my haters , sorry that you couldn't faze me\ 
This night just remind me of\ 
Everything they deprived me of\ 
We done did everything they could think of\ 
Greatness is what we on the brink of 
I could not hold the urge in of telling you off . So if you want to steam and be mad at me for what I said , then go ahead , but you'd just be doing the same thing I did . And you'd just be proving my point . :)
