This weekend was great ... all you scholarly gentlemen , who know who they are , thank you ( especially Beadlessk and his dad for letting us vagabonds invade their property ) . Now , to revel in access to running water , a steady supply of food , and a mattress ...

Hey , so everybody ... I feel a real calling to go on the Alaska Missions Trip this summer ... however , certain aspects may be interesting to deal with . Some prayer would be highly appreciated .

Everybody , thank you so much for the birthday wishes . They're especially appreciated because I've been really sick the past couple of days ( with a fever maxing out at 103 and some vomiting ) . Thank you , again . 
Viral gastroenteritis is no picnic ... I'm out of commission for the next couple of days . Sorry , everyone . Although , the staff at South County Hospital are pretty wonderful .

Today was pretty amazing . It started off rather bad ( I missed the bus , had to call my uncle , then cancel because I found another ride ) , but by the end , it was great .

Hope and North Providence . It was intense .
