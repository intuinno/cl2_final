I would like to know what in the world is farmville 

Farmville is very addictive 
Cold and bored kids came home from school early and what do all boys want FOOD ! 
Well , goodnight been working hard in my farm haha i should have better things to do , you know , like SLEEP 
Good afternoon everyone I just saw some very horrific things from save our farmers ppl please pray for these ppl and for all violence that goes on around the world and the predjudice that ppl indure everyday God bless the world and all my friends on facebook . 
I Pledge Allegiance to the Bible , Gods Holy Word . I will make it a Lamp to my feet and a Light to my path , and will hide it's words in my heart that I might not sin against God . 
tree on my house inapril 2009 
God has a positive answer . You say , \ I feel all alone . \ " God says ; \ " I will never leave you or forsake you . \ " Hebrews 13 : 5 Believe God is there for you . " 
Today is the day when I need to remember God loves me and he will not put more on me than I can handle . 
Thanks to everyone in sending gifts for my stable . I am halfway done . Again thanks 
I'm so glad to have this day . Thank you God for blessing me and my family today . 
whats going on with farmville . I can not gift or recieve any and thae program is running slow . Does anyone know whats going on ? 
I need 5 harness to finish my horse barn if you guys can help I would really be grateful Thanks in advance 
People should not fight over health care reform everyone should join together and pray because most everyone does not actually know what this < PROPMALE > means for them or their families look for the truth and believe me we really need help on healthcare , insurance is the richest business there is and they know we need them and they do take advantage . Well that is my view and that is all just a view . 
Sorry everyone I have not been able to check on ppls farms and gift like I should but my mother-in-law is very ill and I have 2 kids at home and I just have not had much time to spend on here or have anytime for myself . It will get better and I truely thank all of yall for being so kind . Have a great day and week . 
Yesterday and today I have been finding 1st cousins on facebook that I have not seen in about 20 years and that is a shame because we all were together when we were younger and to realize that I would not know them on the streets is a shame . I am grateful for facebook 
To everyone who may read the comment about taking a dog to get welfare and comparing a dog to blacks and hispanics I would just like to say facebook is not a place for comments like this . my son is bi-racial and he was given to me by God and I am grateful , so if ppl have a problem with this then please take me off your friends list because I only want Godfearing , loving ppl as friends not haters thank you . 
well , getting all the trimmings done for my BBQ , baby back ribs , smoked chicken , got the vegs on the grill doing their thing , making tator salad , slaw , baked beans and rolls , My husband is a grill master makes his own sauces for his meats and boy are his ribs finger licking good . 
Watch the documentary on HBO callled Gasland the leak on the gulf is bad but to watch this and the effects the drill for oil on ppl is horrific . When Bush became president he passed a law stopping all test on the chemicals that the oil companies use to drill and the epa cannot test and ppl are getting sick , so who gets the blame for this one , does Obama have to < PROPFEMALE > this one on his back as well . Just a thought . 
good night to all going to try and get some much needed rest , should have already gonebut you know how it is . 
I might not be the most beautiful or the sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be a first choice , but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , becuase I am just too good at being me . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past , but I am proud of who I am today ! Take ... me as I am or watch me as I walk away .. Post this as your status if you love being YOU !!!! 
I enjoyed my day talking to friends I have not seen in about 20 years . Sure was nice to remember the good ole days , thanks guys for lifting up my spirit today .

evening or morn'n fb whichever is good 4 u sitting here everyone sleeping and enjoying quiet time . 
sorry i was 2 tempted the temptations , ' PAPPA WAS A ROLLING STONE . sometimes u just can't help ur self ' 
happy , anxious passionate , emotional , in love , sweet , kind , sometimes sad , angry , whichever one you may be , or you may be all of them , embrace them cause all these emotions make up a big part of who you are and you would not be complete without them . 
my housework is complete , laundry washing kids off 2 school now sit down a take a break . 
bitter sweet my daughter < PROPFEMALE > is getting calls from colleges eveywhere aleady . Her senior year is just beginning and she is aleady getting scholaship offers up to 10,000 dollars a year I am so proud of her she deserves this amd much more . I will miss her when she leaves home but it will be nice to see her living her life to the fulliest . 
I might not be the most beautuful or the sexiest , nor do i have the perfect body . I night not be everyones 1st choice but i am a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone i am not because i am good at being me . That sums me up folks . 
glad to c another day n my life and am very grateful to have my children 4 another day . I love life with all my might but sometimes I believe life doesn't wnt me to have the peace I feel I deserve . When I try to laugh and live a little something or someone is always there to steal my joy ! 
PPL take my kindness and love for living as a weakness but I say to those who believe I am weak , I have alot of experience at falling down but I ALWAYS get back up and start again . Some believe I fell off the turnip truck yesterday and sometimes its a gd thing 4 them to think that , I guess Ive got all my complaints down 4 the day thanks fb 4 listening . 
Keep this going !!! Heavenly Father , walk through my home and take away all my worries and any illness and please watch over and heal my family in Jesus name , Amen . Stop what you are doing and set this to your status . Watch what He'll do . With God ALL things are possible ! 
TODAY IS MY BABY GIRL < PROPFEMALE > BDAY SHE IS 18 YRS OLD AND IT IS BITTER SWEET 4 ME . I AM GLAD THAT SOON SHE WILL B ON A JOURNEY OF HER OWN BUT SO SAD THAT HER DAD IS NOT HERE TO C HIS GIRLS TAKING ON THIS WORLD HE WOULD B SO PROUD OF THEM < PROPFEMALE > WILL SOON B LEAVING THE NEST AND GOING 2 COLLEGE 2 BECOME A BIOGIST SCIENTIST WHO WOULD EVER HAVE DREAMED THAT < PROPMALE > HANKINS AND ME WOULD PRODUCE SUCH SMART KIDS LOL :) 
Girly girls come from New York , sweet girls come from Texas , prissy girls \

It is\ 
said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without \ 
speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends \ 
pick up like they spoke just yesterday , regardless of how long it has \ 
been or how faraway they live . And , they don't hold grudges . They \ 
... understand that life is busy , but you will ... always love them .. \ 
Re-postif you have at least 1 of these friends !!

I AM A HANDFUL ! Unfortunately most women WON'T repost this . I'm strong willed , independent , a bit outspoken , and I tell it like it is . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve ... me at my best . If you are a HANDFUL , repost ! I dare you ........ I'll be looking for the ladies who repost !!

THE PPL HAVE SPOKEN , WHETHER U R DEMOCRATE OR REPUBLICAN DOES NOT MATTER , WHAT DOES MATTER IS PPL R HURTING N THIS COUNTRY AND WE NEED SOLUTIONS NOT ARGUEMENT . THE PPL DO NOT HAVE TIME 4 BITTERNESS WE NEED POLICYS N PLACE 4 ALL . < PROPMALE > OR POOR COME 2GETHER AND HELP PPL KEEP THEIR JOBS , HOMES AND KEEP FAMILIES 2GETHER . 
thinks if men would treat the women in their live the way they did when trying to get her ... they may actually keep her ! just saying

IS trying to understand why people can't just be honest with intentions , instead of hiding behind them and thinking that they haven't done anything wrong

I have alot of respect 4 my dad he has always allowed me 2 live my life and not interfere , he has done his job as a father by just being here 2 love me and that means so much 2 me so today I have the honor of telling my dad happy b'day and i love him . wish i could c him but soon i will . happy b'day dad 
THANKS 2 ALL OUR VETERANS 4 STEPPING UP 2 THE PLATE AND FIGHTING 4 OUR FREEDOM . MUCH LOVE GOES OUT 2 < PROPFIRST > WATKINS AND < PROPMALE > FENNELL WHO R IN AFGANASTAN AS I TYPE THIS , I AM HONORED 2 HAVE WATCH YALL GROW INTO BRAVE YOUNG MEN , I REMEMBER ALL THE LAUGHS AND CRAZY THINGS THAT YALL DID AT MY HOME AS YOUNG BOYS , DO YALL REMEMBER THE WATER BALLOON FIGHT WE HAD ON RAYBURN ? 
Let's see how forthcoming my Facebook friends are ... and if they are paying attention . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of your first name , no repeats . It can only be 1 word . Then copy and paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you ! This should be fun ! 
often you think when your rejected that you are not good enough , but the truth is they weren't ready for all you have to offer ! 
WELL TODAY HAS ALREADY STARTED CRAZY , GOT UP LATE , HAD A MISUNDERSTANDING WITH SOMEONE AND NOW FEEL LOST SO WHATS NEXT ? 
i want to say thank u 2 a very gd friend of mine , < PROPFEMALE > hobb crawford , she is a true freind 2 the end , she stands beside her friends no matter what . she knows the truth bout the past and the present and she is always here not 2 judge but just 2 be there if she is needed . 
everyone should always b careful who they call friends , and i am glad i know the difference i have few friends cause i am choosy but sometimes we all slip , so n order 4 me 2 stay n check i trust only a few and my sweet family from the hankins 2 the logans they r the ones who know who i am and of course cannot leave out my friend < PROPFEMALE > . 
i love ppl but sometimes ppl will take things out of content and turn things around 2 fit their needs these r the ones we all must stay clear of , but always b there 2 lead a hand if they need it . i hold no hard feelings 4 noone cause n the end i only have me 2 answer 4 , 
at the end of the day when all is said and done i know i can lay my head down and close my eyes and know i have not intentionly hurt noone but if i do happen 2 hurt someone i will b a better person and stand up and let them know that i am sorry 4 any wrong doing . what more could anyone ask 4 out of a person ? 
being a adult is knowing when u r wrong and owning up 2 it , trust only urself and realize when someone is play'n games . I am 2 old 2 play i gave up the playground a long time ago now i save it 4 my children . today i can say i am a adult , NOT PERFECT , but i try 2 b there 4 all i make mistakes and i can say I WILL OWN UP 2 MINE will anyone else ? 
i am thankful 4 my family and close friends that i have , life is gd no matter if it is bad . i will live life with no regrets and always try my best 2 treat ppl with respect , i will also not judge a person because that is not my place , how can u judge someone and not c ur own faults . i will work on me and let the rest of the world handle their own . 
i am not perfect but i always look at me cause if i watch what others r doing i will miss what is going on n my life and i can promise u this when i lose prospective of my own life it will spin out of control so i love all but i will not allow my life to tumble sorry if that sounds selfish . 
if someone makes derogatory statements toward u assuming u have done something wrong they should always confront that person because a assumption is just what it is , a assumption , that is the only way 2 find out the truth , sometimes this person may b surprised that they may have jumped the gun so always check urself b4 u assume . 
i have enjoyed spending time n the past with all my friends from long ago but today is the day i say , u cannot go back and would not if i could , so from this moment on i will leave the past where it belongs and enjoy my old friends n the present i love all of yall and i wish nothing but gd 4 everyone . so lets start fresh and talk bout now cause no gd comes from looking back . 
i think i have fractured my ankle it hurts and so swollen cannot hardly walk but me being the person i am , i am up and going no matter what still got 2 take care of my mother in law . has anyone ever had 2 walk up and down stairs when u can't walk ? well if u haven't its a challenge . 
well fb friends got a busy day ahead , gotta go make pies , cakes and get all my side work done 4 my thanksgiviing dinner . got my tree up yesterday whew glad that is out of the way . so have a gd day all . 
wish i could go home 2 spend this thanksgiving with my dad and go c my gradmother i have not spent any holidays with my fam n tn n 16 years i sure do miss all the gd times we use 2 have . i love my family very much expecially my grandmother , she is the 1 who kept me grounded and taught me how 2 b a lady love u much < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
well have cooked 4 pies 2 cakes got onions andcelery cut up , got eggs boiled , cornbread done 4 dressing laundry done , house cleaned now rest 4 a few and get back 2 cooking . 
thanks 2 everyone 4 all the bday wishes had a great day and thankful 4 all my friends and family and most of all thankful 2 still b here 2 enjoy i am truely blessed . 
had a gd night with my daughter she was off work last night and we went out 4 my bday . got home little b4 2 this morning but i enjoyed dancing with < PROPFEMALE > and all the laughing we did it was a wonderful evening . a big thanks 2 my husband 4 taking care of home while i was away from the nest . a nice breather 4 me . 
u know it is great 2 c ppl very much n love , but it is not everyones business what goes on behind closed doors . so folks lets keep our personal life where it belongs at home behind those doors . 
1028 , have not known u 4 long but u seem 2 b a nice person and i hope u get what u have always wanted out of life u deserve it . 
SOMETIMES PPLS PERCEPTIONS R NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM 2 B BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW SOME COULD GET THE WRONG IMPPRESSION EXSPECIALLY WHEN SOME INFO IS LEFT UNSAID . I AM A GD PERSON WHO JUST LIKE OTHERS MAKE MISTAKES BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND OTHERS I OWN UP 2 MINE , LIFE IS GREAT AND I AM THANKFUL 
SOME PPL TRY SO HARD PRETENDING BEING HAPPY , WHEN NSIDE THEY R SO LOST ,, AND DO NOT KNOW WHAT 2 EXPECT OUT OF OTHER PPL . I SAY B URSELF HAPPY OR SAD LET THE WORLD C THE REAL U AND NOT A PERCEPTION BECAUSE AFTER ALL , ISN'T A PERCEPTION OF BEING SOMETHING U R NOT THE SAME AS LYING ? JUST SAYING 
CHRISTMAS IS SUPPOSE 2 B A VERY SPECIAL TIME BUT THIS YEAR I AM HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THE JOLLY PART I AM MISSING MY FAM N TENN AND I WOULD JUST LOVE 2 RUN HOME AND SEE THOSE I HAVE NOT SEEN N YEARS AND ALL THE HANKINS CREW . AND 2 MY WONDERFUL GRANDMOTHER < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > U R MY LIGHT U SHINE ON ME EVERYDAY I LOVE U SO MUCH . 
IREMEMBER SO MANY GD TIMES WITH ALL MY FAM AND I MISS THEM ALL I WISH ALL A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS AND I LOVE ALL YALL . 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS TO ALL MY FB FRIENDS AND FAM I HOPE IT IS A WONDERFUL TIME 4 U ALL . I M OFF HERE 2 GO DO ALL MY COOKING WHEW MAYBE 1 DAY I WILL HAVE SOMEONE 2 COOK 4 ME LOL SEE YALL 
WELL , GD MORNING ALL I HAVE NOT SPOKEN N A LONG TIME BUT THOUGHT I WOULD JUST SAY HI AND HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYS THIS DAY . 
family is a very important and we sometimes seem to forget , we all need each other and when we all realize that we will b alot better off , we should never take it for grated . 
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF PPL BEING ABLE TO SPEAK THEIR MIND BUT IF I DO THEN I AM WRONG , BUT THE TRUTH IS NOONE WANTS TO HEAR THE TRUTH . 
I AM 44 YRS OLD AND MY CHILDREN WERE TAUGHT TO RESPECT THEIR ELDERS WHETHER THEY WERE RITE OR WRONG I EARNED THE RITE TO SPEAK MY MIND AND I HAVE ALSO EARNED THE RITE TO B RESPECTED I DONT ASK FOR RESPECT I EXPECT RESPECT AND THE WORLD NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THAT KIND OF THINKING AND MAYBE WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY BOUT OUR CHILDREN GETTING OUT HERE AND DOING SO MANY BAD THINGS 
I DO NOT PROCLAIM TO HAVE PERFECT CHILDREN THEY MAKE MISTAKES JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT THEY KNOW THEIR BOUNDRIES WITH ME AND OTHERS . BUT I AM GRATFUL 1 IS OFF TO COLLEGE THIS YEAR AND 1 IS LIVING HER OWN LIFE AND PAYING HER OWN WAY AND THAT IS HOW IT WORKS . ALL THEY ASK ME FOR IS TO BE HERE IF THEY NEED ME AND I AM . 
FACEBOOK IS NOT THE PLACE TO AIR UR LAUNDRY IT IS A PLACE TO CONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES . SO HOW MANY R LOVED ONES AND HOW MANY R FRIENDS ? IF U WANT TO ARGUE WITH LOVED ONES OR FRIENDS THEN MAYBE IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING BETTER AND FORGET MY EXCISTIST , THEN WE CAN ALL B HAPPY . 
I KNOW ALOT OF PPL BELIEVE THE HEALTHCARE REFORM IS SOCIALIZISM AND THINK IT IS WRONG TO BE TOLD U GOTTA HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THAT IT IS AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS , BUT ISN'T CAR INSURANCE THE SAME ? JUST ASKING 
ALSO , THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD'NT IT B NICE TO KNOW THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS R NOT GOING TO PPL WHO CHOOSE NOT TO WORK AND DEPEND ON US TO < PROPFEMALE > THE LOAD FOR THEM ? IM NOT TALK'N BOUT PPL WHO CANNOT WORK JUST THE 1'S WHO CAN AND DO NOT WANT TO . 
AND THINK BOUT THE ILLEGALS WHO COME HERE AND WORK THAT DO NOT TAKE INSURANCE ON THE JOB CAUSE THEY CAN GET MEDICAID , THE REASON INSURANCE IS SO HIGH N THE WORK FORCE IS BECAUSE ILLEGALS HAVE BECOME THE MAJORITY AND THEY DONT GET INSURANCE SO THAT CAUSES IT TO B HIGHER FOR THE 1'S WHO DO PURCHASE IT . I AM NOT BEING CRITICAL JUST LOOKING FOR ANSWERS . 
I REALIZE THAT WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN OUTLOOK ON THINGS , BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY DONT WE ALL JUST WANT PROSPIERTY FOR ALL AND TO ALL HAVE THE < PROPMALE > TO GO TO COLLEGE , HAVE GD JOBS AND B ABLE TO LIVE A LONG ENJOYABLE LIFE WITHOUT SO MANY OBSTACLES IN EVERYONES WAY 
Why is it hard for some to pray ? But so easy to cuss ? Why is it so hard to repost a Godly bulletin but easy to re-post the gossip ? Why can people worship a celebrity but not Jesus Christ ? Gonna ignore this ? Afraid to get laughed at ? Most of you won’t re-post this .... The Lord said if you deny me in front of your friends ...... I will deny you in front of my father !! I posted it .... will you 
Do any of us really know everybody on our friend list ? Here is a task for you . I want all my fb friends to comment on this status about how you met me .

please pray for my mother n law doctors r only giving her hours to a day to live and please pray for the family thank u 
sometimes i wonder does family really care about each other it use to be family was there for the gd times and the bad but now it seems all family wants to do is knock each other down . 
noone seems to care but love to put their 2 cents worth n but never come around to help well to those type of families i say let me do what i do if u wanna help come on but if not keep ur 2 cents to urself . in the end u will b the 1 who has to look n the mirror not me !
