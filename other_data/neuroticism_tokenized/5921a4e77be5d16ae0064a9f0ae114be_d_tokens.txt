I'm going to Colorado ! Whee ! 
Mr. Matthews worked us out , AND < PROPMALE > practice is later today . Yikes ! 
is going through a hard time . 
had an awesome time at Extreme Dayz ! I don't have to cry in the bathroom anymore ! 
There's a knot in my foot that's hampering my ability to walk ... 
Our school uniforms are awful , and shopping for them was worse . Whaddya mean I hafta try on another shirt just cuz this one's \not the right material ?!!?! \ " AAAAAAARRRRGH !!!! And none of the shoes fit ! "

Went shopping for school clothes .... again . And < PROPFEMALE > Bryn's sleeping over ! Yay !

Go to cw33.com and vote for my sister < PROPFEMALE > !

My newest obsession : http://thecircletrilogy.com/ 
< PROPMALE > Hawkins + < PROPFEMALE > Renfroe = hours of hilariousness . 
If I could go anywhere in time , I would go back to yesterday , and take myself to tomorrow , and skip this dumb assignment . -- < PROPMALE > ( < PROPMALE > and Hobbes ) 
Tonight was amazing ... and I think whatever we've set into motion is greater than anyone can ever anticipate . 
Rain down ..... alll around the world , we're singing , rain down ..... 
So what , I'm not your average girl I don't meet the standards of this world Chasing after boys is not my thing See , I'm waiting for a wedding riiing ..... 
Dance me/ Dance me around/ So my feet don't/ Ever touch down ....... 
I've danced with the devil . It's not fun . He spins you round in circles & bumps you into things and doesn't let go . I much prefer dancing with Jesus . 
Finally figured out the correct way to use chopsticks . Now I'm slightly less likely to drop food on the way to my mouth . 
Some of friends have a special event , & I told them I'd post something .... ONLY 24 HOURS LEFT DUDES , BROS , AND LADIES ! Please come to our show ! it be tomorrow night ( even though i've said this thousands , nay millions of times ) bring a friend to THE DOOR PLANO ! google it ! see you tomorrow ! leave a comment on my wall or this if you have any questions . Christian homeschool kids . Come if you can , cuz I can't go . 
I'm not feeling well . Stayed home sick . Doctor said it was allergies . Bleh . 
Ellerhe . Fall Festival this weekend . Cheers . 
Nngh .... Headache . Sinus issues . 
Crunch time .... 
Everything at the fair is overpriced ....... but it was great . I had so much fun today . Now my feet hurt ...... I want my own foot massage chair like the ones they have . 
Nnngh . Just got home from babysitting . Two small rowdy boys and one \Princessy\ " girl . You'd think I'd learn to not * offer * piggyback rides and such things ........ " 
Sidewalk Sunday school was fun . To those other people from that other church group : THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION . WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE . Good grief ..... 
Sidewalk Sunday was great . But to those other church people we met : IT'S NOT A COMPETETITION AND WE * ARE * REAL CHRISTIANS . Good grief ...... 
DO NOT accept a friend request from < PROPFIRST > Butterfield . He is a Hacker . Tell everyone on your list because if 1 of your friends adds him as a friend he will be able to get your computer's id and address . So let everyone know- ... copy & paste this message and add it to your status . 
Ok ..... ignore my earlier status . I checked it out on snopes , and it's false . A hoax . Sorry ..... 
Went to the doctor's for an IV after school . Not very fun . Felt light-headed and naseous at first , then weak and shaky after they diluted the concentration . Was wobbly after the whole thing . 
The < PROPFEMALE > Szchech concert was awesome last night ! I only wish I'd jumped up on the stage sooner . :-D 
Happy end of tax season day ! 
siiiiiiiiiiiiiiggghhhhhhhhh .......... 
just read the my school's newsletter detailing all the things \we\ " are doing to prevent swine flu . Nobody in upper school actually does any of these things except the hand washing ..... " 
An apple a day will keep anyone away , if you throw it hard enough . 
Ah yes , sleep . I remember sleep . I should try that again sometime . 
We're getting new carpet put in , which means moving everything around . My feet hurt .... 
My friends are hilarious . Oh , and we got new carpet . 
Today I heard some loud whispering and shuffling noises near the lounge in my dorm . I walked around the corner to find 20 people in a giant hula hoop . When they saw me one screamed \get her\ " and they all shuffled after me . I ducked into the laundry room to find another kid crouched there who asked \ " hiding from the hula hoop ? \ " MLIA " 
Kinda has a headache .... 
Walked past our study room and saw my mom sitting on my sister's lap . The reason ? \There wasn't another chair and < PROPFEMALE > wouldn't move . \ " Perfectly good excuse . " 
We're going to San < PROPMALE > tomorrow , so my grandma came over today to pick up our dog , forcing me to take my daily walk without him . There's this Grand Pyrenese that I can see b/c the fence is these black iron bars . I have no idea who the owner is , but I knew the dog had gotten a haircut , and he asked where Bear was . I love being a dog owner . 
Hi . 
Boo . 
I may not have stayed up for the new year last night , but I did get to visit with some wolves ! ^_^ 
Dangit < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I'm getting tired of these \Join to make our group really big ! \ " groups . " 
Has no opinion on the current cowboy game . 
Still can't get Like Whoa out of my head . I'd like another catchy song now , please . 
Home sick ( to my stomach ) .

From one of my fb groups : You can spend minutes , hours , days , weeks , even months analyzing a situation , trying to put the pieces together . Justifying what could've , should've , would've happened . Or you can just leave the pieces on the floor and move on . ? 
Luvs mah sisseh . 
Pencils are dangerous weapons . 
Really wants to go to youth , but mom has to take dad dinner , so no car .... :( 
As we were pulling into the driveway , my mom and I saw a possum run across our driveway . Mom was grossed out . I laughed-I've never seen a possum move that fast before ! 
Today was kinda crazy ...... Happy April Fools ! And thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Beavers and < PROPFIRST > Beavers for bringing the puppies . :D

Our alley is a small river .

( I've had that song stuck in my head for a while . ) 
I do believe that our attic is as hot or hotter than the inside of a car left in the sun in the summer . 
Back in Big D . When we arrived , twas 103 . ..... I actually missed this . 
Walked into a culture thing at Richland expecting only free food . Walked out with a bunch of coupon things and a trip to a camp next week in LA . School starts next week . AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH

Saw an article in the paper about a thing called fried frito pies , and got excited for the fair . FAIR FAIR FOOD FUN FUN FOOOOOOD FAAAAIIIIIIRRRR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Texas weather : SUMMER SUMMER SUMMER SUMMER FALL ! Fall ? Summer summer FALL ! 
While sitting at an outside table , I eeped and jumped back before deciding to move so Mr. Jumping Spider wouldn't become part of my lunch . The lady at the table across the way looked at me like I was nuts . I didn't bother to explain . 
Does anyone know of a native African novelist whose books are readily available in stores ???? 
Corny dog . \ 
Fried cheese curds . \ 
Fried chocolate . \ 
Fried lemonade . \ 
Fried grilled cheese . \ 
Pinapple ice cream cone . \ 
My body hates me right now , but it was worth it . 
I'm between sluggish and hyperactive . Trying to decide whether to go on a walk or not . 
Am I the only one who misses the warm weather ? 
My sister was on TV , on the new show on Fox called Lonestar , for a few seconds tonight . My mom's squeals of delight were eardrum piercing . She's more excited than < PROPFEMALE > is . \ 
( Oh , and MY SISTER'S ON TV ! ) 
Going to the meet the candidates thing tonight was interesting ..... I liked hearing their viewpoints , but fet kind of cornered . They're all like , Ooh , first time voter ! Fresh meat ! Also , vote for < PROPMALE > Quine for judge ! ( I wish I could tag whole groups , cuz I wanna tag everyone in worldviews . ) Um , he's the son of a guy who wrote a Christian worldview curriculum I did , so yeah .... and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > seems pretty good . 
Was jerked awake this morning by a nasty leg cramp . My leg still hurts .

Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Jenkins , my cheeks hurt . \ 
This has been brought to you by a drowning < PROPMALE > . 
Wishes Richland had more eating options . 
Tomorrow , I have a Spanish test on terms we didn't cover . The teacher , upon finding out that only a few people had done the workbook pages concerning said terms , became upset . I am not pleased . ( Read : I am fuming and trying not to show it . ) 
I feel like changing my status . 
My dad's advice for when the car breaks down : Step 1 : Panic . Step 2 : Run around the car screaming and flailing your arms .

INBOX ONLY : Tell me something you have always wanted to say to me . It will\ 
stay between us . Then repost this as your status and see what you get ! 
I don't really like writing on walls . It's like a private conversation that everyone can see , and what's the point of that ? 
Just got back from a walk . The re-warming of my hands hurts my knuckles so much typing is literally a pain . This is why I stopped cracking them . Next time , I'll remember my gloves . Owie . 
I now know that it is possible to eat pudding through pantyhose . 
I need some crutches . I could swing along quite happily on crutches . 
And I'm so thankful\ 
Words can never be enough 
Tangled was totally worth seeing in 3D . 
Random obscure Disney reference ! \

So today , I somehow managed to slip on a patch of ice and fall -- WITHOUT BREAKING THE GLASS IN MY HAND . I don't even know how that happened -- it was in front of me on the patio when I'd finished processing everything . 
Sometimes , fb likes are just that good :\ 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns k ! ll people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! 
News flash : YOUR SIGN DOES NOT DEFINE YOU . 
It's a good thing I took Bear instead of Lil Bit for my nightly walk --- we saw our friendly neighborhood coyote on our way back home ! ^_^ 
From ( The Customer Is ) Not Always Right :\

Me : “Thank you for calling , how may I help you ? ”\ 
Caller : “Yeah . Do Xbox 360s come with cup holders ? ”\ 
Me : “Uh ”\ 
Person in the background : “IT’S ON FIRE ! ” 
Came home from a walk this afternoon to the smoke alarm going off and Lil Bit howling . After opening the windows to alleviate the swirling smoke , Bear promptly threw up on the tile by back door , completely ignoring the front one , which was open . 
My new weekend is Tuesday and Thursday . 
It is a strange thing to go to school on a Saturday morning . 
Copy this and paste it in your status if you know someone , or have heard of someone who knows someone .

Oh and the hearts ? ? ? ? for < PROPMALE>'s sake don't forget the hearts ? ? ? ? 
Pet Supplies Plus is so much better than PetSmart . 
Please pray that God will get < PROPFIRST > to L.A. A.S.A.P. , and that he'll be able to find food in the meantime .

Maybe an affinity for things with < PROPFIRST > ( mathematics , technology ) or things with words ( writing ) or pictures ( < PROPMALE > ) is in the wiring of the brain . \ 
For instance , I can't follow < PROPFIRST > . I have to memorize their pattern in my short short term memory ( repetition intentional ) to be able to follow them at all . \ 
When reading , my eyes fly over the < PROPFEMALE > while formulating pictures and ideas in my head at the same time .
