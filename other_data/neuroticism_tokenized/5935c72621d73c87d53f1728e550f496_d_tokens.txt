Dear\ 
Mr President , \ 
I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military \ 
starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save\ 
much more money for our country ? While you're at it , let's cut \ 
congressmans pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue to pay for those who take no \ 
risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree . 
Feels like such a girl when a \chickflic\ " makes him cry .... " 
From now until December 7th , change your profile picture to one of a cartoon character from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . ...
