Just making this Facebook because everyone keeps saying that they can't find me on here :) ~ 

My oldest daughter is not feeling well :( 
I really need to get to bed , but i probably won't for another 2 hours *** YAWN *** 
Wondering who's going to win \America's Got Talent \"" 
Today's hubby's birthday , so we had quesadillas :) Sorry to the few of you that I know this will cause disappointment to . 
It's definitely getting colder . 38 degrees when I got up & closed all the windows this morning :) ~ 
The boys are with friends , hubby's at work so it's just the girls chillin ' at home :) 
If I don't get sleep soon , I'm gonna snap ! 
How much can one person handle ? I think God has way too much confidence in me ! 
Still waiting to find out what's going to happen ....................... 
So bored waiting for hubby to finish fixing his computer , so he'll go to bed with me ' cause it's cold & I wanna snuggle . 
A decision has been made . Now to ride the rollercoaster of emotions . These are the times I know that God holds me so that I can continue to move forward . 
God < PROPMALE > me the Serenity to accept the things I can not change , The Courage to change the things I can & the Wisdom to know the difference . And the Strength of Faith to step back & trust YOU when I feel like giving up . 
I hope this is just allergies because I have too much to do to get sick ! 
My heart is hurting so much , but I have done all that I know how to do . I give it all to God ! 
Stuck between a rock & a hard place & both are trying to close in on me . 
Onto the next chapter in this saga we call life . 
Took the next step & again we wait ... 
Heading in a different direction & not sure how that is going to go . 
I am amazed that no matter what you do , some people would rather fight for the enemy than for the one person who has ALWAYS been there for them ! 
Just going to keep praying & allow God to guide my heart . I can not do this alone . 
Actually did some Christmas shopping yesterday :) The older kids are the hardest to buy for ! 
In all of her life , I have never lied to her , yet I am the one she doesn't believe . 
Wishing everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving !!! 
Now to focus on my favorite holiday ... Christmas !!! 
“When you have come to the edge Of all light that you know And are about to drop off into the darkness Of the unknown , Faith is knowing One of two things will happen : There will be something solid to stand on or You will be taught to fly” 
I believe the worst pain in a mother's life is watching her child hurt & be unable to stop the pain . 
My greatest hope is that when my children are grown , I can proudly say \These are my children\ " & they will proudly say \ " This is my mom \"." 
So many thoughts , so many emotions , too many things that can go wrong . Please Lord , guide me in Your ways , so that all I do gives the < PROPFEMALE > to You ! 
It's a beautiful snowy day . Hope that it returns next Friday for a beautiful White Christmas ! 
So happy that hubby made it safely to work ! It took 7 & 1/2 hours to make a 35 minute drive because of snow & shut down roads . 
Wishing everyone a Very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas filled with love , laughter & a true joy for this season . God bless each & everyone of you ! {{{{{ HUGS }}}}} 
Had an absolutely wonderful visit with my < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stuto-nichols & her fiancé < PROPFIRST > Papa . I wish they didn't have to go back yet , but all good things must come to an end . It was great celebrating the New Year with you guys !!! 
I need to drag myself back to the land of the living , but I find myself more comfortable hidden deep inside my home . 
Today was a good day :) 
Every day , I find more reasons to fall in love with my hubby :) 
It's time to show the world that more of us support our troops than don't! If you support our troops , then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour . And if you don't stand behind our troops , please feel free to stand in front of them . 
On this day , I make you this promise : Wherever you are , I will love you . However long we may be parted , I will wait for you . However much I may doubt the world , I will trust you . Whatever I am doing , I will honor you . However many years pass , I will want to be with you . Whatever challenges come our way , I will < PROPFEMALE > you . 
The snow as begun to crawl up the back door . Guess I am in for the weekend :( 
The snow is melting & the drive is mostly clear YEA !!!!!!! 
The kids have Saturday school & they aren't even in trouble :) ~ 
? ? In honor of February , the month of love , post your wedding picture as your profile picture from now until < PROPFIRST>'s Day .? ? Show your Facebook friends your true love .? ? If you aren't married , post a picture of you and your sweetie ? ? 
Today is my oldest's 18th birthday . Where did the time go ? 
What on earth ? The kids had a THREE hour delay today . When did they start that ? 
It's snowing again :( What happened to this great global warming that we are suffering from ? 
Farmville friends : I am just getting started on my horse stables & would appreciate whatever ya'll can send me :) 
More snow heading our way . This will make my youngest very happy & her Aunt < PROPFEMALE > too :) ~ 
TCS letting out at 1:30 pm 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day to all of my friends . It's already started out great !!! 
As I < PROPFEMALE > on the strength of my Lord , I know that it is His power that makes things happen :) 
If your DAD is your Hero , whether you are blessed to have him with you , or he has passed on , copy & paste this in your status & write his name ---- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Montgomery ( March 9 , 1943- July 11 , 2005 ) Forever Loved ~ Forever Missed 
Hubby just ordered me my own laptop with a 320GB hard drive !!! 
Today would have been Daddy's 67th birthday . I still miss him very much , but I know that he is in the Greatest Hands ! 
It's official ! My oldest daughter is now a Spalding !!! 
Let go & let God . That is the only thing I have found to truly work in my life . Great things happen when He is in control :) 
May God give you ... For every storm , a rainbow , For every tear , a smile , For every care , a promise , And a blessing in each trial . For every problem life sends , A faithful friend to share , For every sigh , a sweet song , And an answer for each prayer . 
My youngest son took first place at the Career Club competition !!! We all went to < PROPMALE > E . Cheese to celebrate ! Great Day !!! 
As my heart breaks , I am reminded that we must let our children seek their own futures , make their own mistakes & become their own individuals . So with that , I say , May you always be blessed with happiness , hope and true love & never forget that I am here for you no matter what may happen . I love you ! 
240 eggs filled & more to finish later :) ~ 
Final count on eggs ... 351 . I have no clue why it's an odd number , but we'll make it work :) Wishing all of my friends a very blessed & happy Easter !!! 
By the end of the day , I will hopefully be telling my youngest son that his wish is coming true . 
The kids are already asking to fill the pool :) Hoping to maybe go swimming this weekend ! 
God blessed our trip in numerous ways :) 
Loved spending the last few days with my < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !!! It's been too long . Can't wait until she's closer :) 
Headache , fever & a swollen throat :( Not a good day . 
Rip my throat out or just shoot me . I can't take this pain anymore !!! 
Hubby was right . The doc says I have severe strep throat . But now I have meds & will get all better :) ( And I can get my house clean again cause these people are useless when I'm sick ) LOL 
May God's hands be on every heart involved & may peace finally be achieved . 
My youngest son will < PROPFEMALE > his daddy's last name within the next month or so . Talk about a happy boy & a happy daddy & that makes for a happy mommy :) 
Through Facebook , I have found 3 of my cousins that I love very much & through them I am getting acquainted with 8 of my 2nd cousins ( their beautiful children ) . Thank you God for such a wonderful & unexpected blessing !!! 
Happy Mother's Day to all of the moms & also to the dads who do double duty as mom & dad . You know who you are & you deserve recognition as well :) \ 
Love to each & every one of you !!! 
I shall start the chant of the Little Engine that Could ... \ 
I Think I Can , I Think I Can , I Think I can ....................... 
Turned in all the final paperwork for the \ 
adoption . Just waiting for the judge to sign it & my youngest son will \ 
finally be a Spalding !!! 
Woke up not feeling well this morning , but it was my little one who wound up getting sick :( 
I'm trying to find a way to forgive someone for something they have done that was both vicious & life altering . I don't know how long it may take for me to do so , but I must before the fury eats me alive . 
Be careful with your words . Once they're said , they can only be \ 
forgiven , not forgotten . 
Lord , Thank you for the wonderful friends that I have who have been there for me in the middle of the night when I have desperately needed them . \ 
{{{ HUGS }}} to those special ladies 
Thank you to every man & woman\ 
who is , or was ever , in\ 
the military in any branch at any time . God bless you & keep you\ 
safe . To each family who has lost a loved one to war , God bless your\ 
families- Their deaths were not in vain . 
I am madly in love with the one person \ 
who understands what's going on in my crazy head ! Thank you for always being there when I need a shoulder to < PROPFEMALE > on , to cry on or just snuggle up to . 
My oldest Cayleb ) graduates high school tomorrow :) \ 
I am very proud of him & wish him every success as he goes forth . 
Today's the day ! Congratulations BHS Class of 2010 !!! \ 
Extra Hugs to Cayleb , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > :) 
I have 2 kids watching TV , 2 sleeping & hubby is editting on his laptop . Guess who's going to try to sneak a nap ??? \ 
C U L8R :) 
Gonna go make dinner & then hopefully go swimming :) 
As Father's Day approaches 4 very special men come to mind :\ 
< PROPMALE > Montgomery ( Daddy)- He was one of the greatest men I have ever knows & even though he isn't here anymore , he is in my heart always . \ 
< PROPMALE > Spalding ( Hubby)- Who has shown me that a real dad is born of love , with or without blood ties . \ 
Cont ... 
Happy Father's Day to all of the great dads that I know :) May you all have a wonderful day filled with love and appreciation for all that you do !!! 
GRRRRR I Hate frogs !!! \ 
They kept getting in my pool , so I covered it & they STILL got in . Now their little dead bodies are floating around in the waater . GROSS !!!! Now , I have to get them all out , empty the pool & bleach the crap out of it ! Any ideas on how to effectively , but safely keep them away from my pool ?????? 
Had a blast last night , with < PROPFEMALE > , playing American Idol on the Wii . Thanks Aubri :) 
Went to the book sale today & got a ton of books for very little money ! \ 
Hubby found me 8 hardback < PROPFEMALE > Steel books to replace my soft covers . It was a good day :) ~ 
Going to try to get some sleep . Have to go shopping for food stuff for our annual 4th of July cookout . Can't wait to see our friends & will be missing those who aren't with us . \ 
Hope everyone has a safe & joyful 4th of July . \ 
Remember , If it weren't for the servicemen & women who fight the wars , past & present , we would have nothing to celebrate . 
Seven years ago , I was asked if I wanted to run to CompUSA & help a friend look for a USB cable . Afterwards , we went to Publix & got subs and sat around talking until almost 2 am . Little did I know that that night was going to forever change my life . \ 
I am now proudly married to that friend & am so glad to be celebrating 7 years together :) \ 
I LOVE YOU < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Is this what it will take ? This is insane & I want a magic wand to fix it all so that everyone can live in peace . 
No more stress , no more drama , no more heartache , no more frustrations & no more worries . That's all I want for just a little while . 
Don't know what will happen , but hoping that I am up to the challenge . 
SO glad that I am no longer a teenager trying to fit in , be accepted & appreciated , deciding who I am going to be & how I am going to get there . To those of you who are : Be true to you , focus on being the best YOU that you can be , stop worrying about who you are going to impress & start impressing yourself with good decisions that will last a lifetime . 
So tired of doing everything that I am told to do & following every rule to a tee only to be told that no matter what I do , I'm still doing it wrong ! \ 
I want DETAILED instructions from now on !!! 
I now have a list !!! Let's see if they mean it . 
Today is my baby girl's 4th birthday !!! 
Looking for peace in my life , in my home & in myself . 
I finally found a movie that I WANT to see !!! \ 
Vampires Suck coming out August 18th :) 
Please keep my Father-in-Love in prayer . He had a heart attack last night . He's a wonderful man & a very important part of our lives & we really need him to get better quickly . 
God , please give me whatever it is that I need because I'm beyond even knowing what to ask for anymore . 
The kids go back to school tomorrow . They're ready , I'm ready , it's a good thing :) 
One more hour & the quiet will end .... It was great while it lasted :) 
Took < PROPFEMALE > to the doctor & she's doing well :) Have to wait for the blood work to come back to be extra safe . Also got an order for some PT for her , so hoping that will help her get her strength back . I think we're on the right track !!! 
If I open my mouth I may start to cry , so I stay quiet & pray that God can keep this smile in place . 
Brother-in-law & Nephew on the way from Ohio . I can't wait !!! 
Had a great visit with my nephew & brother-in-law . Made a few siggies/tags & played some games :) Now let's see what the week holds in store . 
On Friday , I will celebrate my 5th anniversary !!! This is a < PROPMALE > thing & those who really know me understand why . \ 
I love my darling husband & can't wait to spend MANY more years with him :) 
Very proud of my oldest son , Cayleb . He went down & started the process to enlist in the U.S. NAVY :) 
On this day , I make you this promise : 
< PROPFEMALE > in there . Great advice , but what happens when what you're hanging by is a noose ? 
Two steps forward , five steps back . Screw it , I'm going to just go backwards to see if I can get ahead !!! 
Happy 13th Birthday to my Branman !!! Now there are 3 teens in the house :/ ~ LOL 
When do I get to have a say in my own home again ??? 
Gonna make this a good day for my hubby no matter what anyone tries !!! 
Everyone who has my hubby as a friend , please stop by his < PROPFEMALE > & wish him a Happy Birthday ! If you have his cell # send him one there too :) \ 
I just really want to make him feel good today . THANKS !!! 
IT'S OFFICIAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \

How can someone take such a wonderful time in my life & do their best to screw it up !!! 
I like it on the floor by the bed :) 
Taking my placement test in 3 hours ...... How much have I forgotten throughout the years ??? 
98th percentile in Reading Comprehension & in Arithmetic , 93rd percentile in Sentence Skills & 74th percentile in Algebra . Not too bad for an old chick :) 
Ok , this is for all of you . Based on what you know about me ( or in some cases remember about me ) what do you think I should be when I grow up :\ 
Digital media ( graphic/web designer ) , Accountant or Paralegal ?

The little one can't wait for \Costume day\ " . LOL " 
At the hospital . My baby is getting dental work done :( Hopefully , no more problems once this is over . 
To every man & woman who has ever made the decision to join our military & chose to defend this country & those of us who are blessed to live here .... THANK YOU ! 
Had a great day with hubby & baby today :) Scheduled an appointment to get a family photo done . Went to the library & borrowed some books & movies and purchased 2 hardcovers to add to my < PROPFEMALE > Steel Collection . Got home & opened one of the books & found a $10 < PROPMALE > :) Just made my day better !!! 
Family photos were done today & I think they turned out pretty good . I can't wait to have a 16 X 20 back up on my wall again :) 
HE DID IT !!!! My oldest was sworn into the US NAVY :) 
So proud of my 4 year old ! She went through her stuffed animals , her toy shelves & her share toys & donated them , as well as her puzzle shelf with wooden puzzles & her Silly Six Pins , to the local DV shelter children . She also picked an angel off their Giving tree & we got the gift that was requested . What an amazing little girl I have !!! 
For my husband , whom I love with all my heart ; my children , who are the reason I breathe ; my siblings , nieces & cousins , who I love & who love me even though we are far apart & my friends , who are there for me through the good times & the bad- I am so very thankful !!! 
Had to take baby to the ER last night . She was having trouble breathing :( Found out that she has croup . She's so miserable . So please pray that she feels better soon . 
CHANGE\ 
YOUR PROFILE PICTURE to a Cartoon OR Cartoon Character from your \ 
Childhood to join the fight against Child Abuse . The goal ??? Not to see a\ 
human face on Facebook til Monday , December 6th . Join the Fight ! Copy \ 
& paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same !!! 
So tired , but I know I won't sleep well when I do go to bed because I have to keep checking on baby . She's getting better , but the nights are still a little rough on her . May take her to her doctor Monday if she doesn't do better soon . 
Just finished making Christmas ornaments with the 3 younger kiddos :) 
Not sure about the new profile layout ......... 
< PROPFEMALE > Blackwell , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > A . Bickford we need to pick a day to get together SOON !!! 
We were suppose to get about ONE ( 1 ) inch of accumulation . Somebody can't count !!! More like 4 inches , but it is very pretty & the roads near me got cleared , so it's not all bad :) 
My darling friends & family , may your Christmas be filled with gratefulness for what you have & joy for what you have given to others . I hope it is not about the getting , but rather about the giving . Many blessings to each of you & to your families . < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS !!! 
Ok , so I did NOT request all of this white stuff , so could someone come collect it ? You do not need to share with me . If I want a white Christmas , I'll buy some spray paint !!! 
YEA !!! Electric is back on ! House only got down to 59 , so very grateful for that :) 
Snow go away so my < PROPMALE > can come visit me . I miss her very much !!! 
Off to bed , A'Layna has surgery ( adenoids removed & turbinates reduced ) @ 7am . We have to be at the Medical Center @ 6am , so leaving the house around 5am . Praying that this surgery is successful & she can breathe through her nose again . Also , praying that we have a safe trip with no snow or ice on the roads . 
Had a safe trip to the Medical Center . She is back in surgery now . Luckily , we made sure they knew she was very anxious because they were prepared with an anti-anxiety med for her . So far , the receptionist & nurses have been wonderful with her & have been able to keep her from panicking :) 
Back home . A'Layna is tucked in bed doing a < PROPMALE > Potter marathon . The surgery went very well , but she is in a lot of pain . Percocets are on their way . For those who asked : A'Layna had to have her adenoids removed & the turbinates in her nose cut/shaved down because she could no longer breathe out of her nose . Thank you for the prayers & please continue praying for a speedy recovery .

Do fight with someone about something they never really cared about or do you sit back & watch as they dig their own hole deeper ? 
Judge others by their character or they will judge you by yours . 
Please pray for my dear friend's ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ) mom . She's in ICU and not doing well . Please pray for this family . Thank you .

You know your 4 year old has watched too much Howie Mandel when she comes to you & asks \Can I sleep in your room ? Deal or No Deal . \ " LOL " 
Have you ever had one of those days where you look at what you have & think \I have a great life\ " . Today is one of those days for me :) Thank you God for everything You have blessed me with !!! " 
\Facing the Giants \"- AWESOME MOVIE !!!!!! " 
I'm not talking to myself , only crazy people do that ! I was simply answering the voices in my head ... they had a question . 
I have a wonderful husband . I was hurting & needing sleep so bad & he made sure I got it ! Love you sweetheart !!! 
7 hours & then I have to let go . 
I do NOT need storms right now & especially not the hail that came with them ! 
Got a text that he arrived , but not the expected phone call :( 
HE CALLED !!!!!!!!
