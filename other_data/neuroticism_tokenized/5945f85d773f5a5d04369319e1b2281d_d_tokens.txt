Was really nice to take the day off and not worry about anyting but getting my nails done and taking a nap . Tomorrow = cleaning the house and organizing things for my first day at the new office on Monday !! I'm excited . 

Excited to be starting at my new brokerage this morning . 
Managed to get settled at the new office . Still trying to organize things , but I'm going to hit the ground running . I'm so excited to be here !! 
My new brokerage is so cool . They recognize birthdays in our business meetings and we sing Happy Birthday to everyone . This is a new experience for me and I'm liking it . 
My new phone is just totally awesome !!! 
Good news !! My < PROPFEMALE > , who I thought was in renal failure , is just having a problem with his thyroid . He didn't struggle too much when I gave him pills tonight .... we'll see how long that lasts . YAY !! 
Set up my new CB website . Check it out !! www.coldwellbanker.com/local/dcrichton 
My < PROPFEMALE > is getting better at taking his pills and I am getting better at giving him the pills . So far so good .... and we have to do this twice a day every day for as long as he is with me . 
Okay , so < PROPFEMALE > and I are doing much better with the pills . But < PROPFEMALE > has learned a new trick .... keeping his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth ... Good thing I can outlast him by keeping his jaw open . Don't ever let it be said that my < PROPFEMALE > was stupid ... 
My new Mission Statement : I am a Realtor® who is committed to helping people transition into the next stage of their lives . \

Tell me what you think !! 
It's another glorious day in the Central Valley . Good day to be out buying and selling homes . If anyone has any real estate questions , go ahead and ask . I am always willing to help out my fellow neighbors and friends . 
I was one of two winners in this morning's business meeting . I provided the correct answer to this question : Which month has 28 days ? 
This is what life's all about ... Came to my favorite restaurant for dinner . Sat down at a table and a little guy of no more than 3 came around the corner and sat down with me . I asked if he was going to eat with me and he said yes and then asked me what I was having . Does it get any better than this ? 
I'm a Grandma !! Kyr'n < PROPFIRST > Delon Gray was born at 1:32 pm weighing in at 7 lb 15 oz . New mom and baby doing well . Pictures to be posted later . 
Just got done with a 20 mile bike ride . That was so much fun !! Now to clean up and head to the store for potato salad makings . BBQing steaks tonight ! 
Good food , good company , good movie . Makes me want to do it all over again tomorrow . 
Sneak attack on the wasps nests !! Guess who won !!! 
20 mile bike ride in a higher gear ... doesn't actually make you go faster , just makes you work harder . I'm okay with that . 
I am woman , hear me roar !! Back gutter cleaned out . Check . Wasp nest on second story destroyed . Check check . 
Dang wasps !!! I found a FOURTH nest . I will win this fight .... That nest gets Raid-ed tomorrow morning . Everybody pray I don't fall off the ladder . 
For those of you anxiously awaiting the outcome of the fourth wasp nest .... I need to buy a taller ladder and have not done so yet . Will attempt to purchase said ladder over the weekend and annihilate said wasps then . Stay tuned for further updates . 
To the kid walking at a snail's pace on the sidewalk in front of my office in the 100+ degree heat : Dude ! You're carrying a skateboard ... You've got wheels man ... Use ' em !! 
God rest my grandfather . \

Time to get myself organized for school tomorrow . Woo ... So not looking forward to getting up at 5am . And even less so for English at 6:30 am . This class better fly by this semester . \ 
But that just means we are that much closer to < PROPFEMALE > Gamma Sigma starting and it's shaping up to be a fun semester with my fellow board members and the activies that we currently have planned . 
Today's lesson learned : Don't run the air conditioner in your car while going through the car wash unless you have previously shut the vent . Phew !! It does not smell good . 
You can tell it's the first day of college classes in < PROPMALE > . There are cars everywhere ! 
God Bless the Board of Governors and their fee waivers !! 
( right hand over my heart , left hand in the air ) I promise I will not be a Craislist spammer . Everyone say it with me ... I will not be a Craigslist spammer . 
Why am I on facebook at this hour ??? I have to be up at 5am . And I don't think I did my homework . I'll check in the morning . Night all !! 
I love my vet . He just called to check on me as much as he did my cat . 
Today was a good day . Time spent with my grandson , my daughter , my mom , and my sister . Spent time trying to play Apples to Apples through all of the laughter . My grandson is a cute little guy and his mom is very attentive and loving toward him . I have a great family ! 
So as I'm coming home from the vet I come across a guy pushing what appears to be a homemade sno-cone cart .... honking a bike horn ... He sounded like a duck . LOL\ 
On a brighter note , Frisky gained 2 ounces in 5 days !! Yay !! 
Ah , a rare day to get some housework done . Not to mention homework . < PROPFEMALE > Haw ! 
Lets see how forthcoming my Facebook friends are ... \ 
Leave a one-word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR first name . It can only be one word . Then copy and paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . 
CRAP !! I haven't done my homework yet . 
YAY !!! I'm having lunch with my daughter and grandson today !!! 
Woo Hoo !! I currently have a C in my English class !! A 77% . And I'm not learning a dang thing ... Gonna be a great semester . 
There's nothing like bursting your buyers ' bubble . The perfect house for them is not inside city limits . Which means they can't use the City's down payment assistance program . Big freakin bummer ! 
Feels like a meatball sandwich from Subway kind of day . I'm outta here ! 
\Hey ! I don't want you to ruin your diet . You just lost three and a half pounds . \ " \ " So what . My farts weigh three and a half pounds . \ " LOL I love this new show < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE >!!!!" 
My vet rocks !! Just took Gabby in for a check up and she gave me a great big hug for Frisky passing . 
Is anyone out there interested in getting a dog ? Or know anyone who wants a dog ? \ 
Maze Animal Hospital is trying to place a 5 yr old dog into a good home . Very friendly and sweet dog . Is really good with kids ( vet witnessed several kids crawling on her and the dog didn't care ) . Neutered . \ 
For more information , please call Maze Animal Hospital at 209-524-9281 . 
SHOOTING PUMPKINS FROM A BAZOOKA GUN IS SO MUCH FUN !!!! 
Help ! I'm lost in the witch maze and I haffa pee !! 
Never argue with an idiot . They will bring you down to their level and beat you up with experience . 
Seriously ? My hotel room only has one lamp in it . And the light right inside the door is on a motion detector .... which is cool when you enter the room , but I'm guessing not so much in the middle of the night when trying to access the bathroom ... This should be a fun few days ... 
LET THERE BE LIGHT !!! GOD BLESS THE MAINTENANCE GUY !! 
Anybody want to make some cash tomorrow ?? I need help with a garage / moving sale while I finish packing my house . If you are interested , please call or text 209-985-1300 . 
Ever had one of those days where your mere existence pisses everyone off ? I seem to be mired in one of those today . 
Okay , I'm definitely in the twilight zone ... Now I'm getting FB messages from random people saying things like \It's fate that I was destined to meet you . \ " WTF ?? "

Listening to my housemate sing along with the radio . He's pretty good . I'm enjoying this . 
Wow . Who knew there was a Dillard's in Stockton . I need to get out more often . 
Attenton all non-resident owners !!!! When you list your property , you MAY want to inform your TENANTS so they are not surprised by my phone call when I try to make an appointment to show the property !!! 
OMG !! < PROPFEMALE > actually ventured out of the bedroom , down the hall , and into the kitchen all on her own ! 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Re-post if this made you smile 
What will you choose today ? \ 
I am confident in myself to truly believe that there is nothing I can't do . I am the choice and I choose to be great today . Today I choose to create my own economy . I choose not to be a victim of our society . I will be significant . I will make a difference not only in my life , but for those around me . I choose to be great today . Why ? Because There Is Nothing I Can't Do ! 
Mmmmmm ... deep fried raviolis at < PROPFEMALE>'s in Stockton .... it doesn't get any better than this . 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes !! It's been a truly special day . 
1200 yards in swimming this morning . It was a good workout . Will take time to catch up and really get into it , but I'm up for the challenge . 
Was looking at someone's profile and one of the Activities listed was \God's last name is not ' DAMMIT ' . \ " LOL !!!! That just made my day . " 
Groaner of the day : What does a dyslexic , agnostic , insomniac do at night ? 
Only 1150 yards in the pool today ... and it didn't feel like it . This is going to be a good semester . \ 
So for those of you keeping track ( which is only me , I admit ) , that's a total of 3650 yards swam so far . Figure about a 1000 yards a day , so 4000 yards a week , and we're talking 60,000 yards for the semester . How many < PROPMALE > is that ?? Oy . 
I am strong because I am weak . I'm beautiful because I know my flaws . I'm a lover because I am a fighter . I'm fearless because I have been afraid . I'm wise because I have been foolish & I can laugh because I have known sadness . 
Listening to my roommate sing . Even with a cold he's pretty good ... but I'm pretty sure he's making up some of the words . :) 
Now my roommate has The Andrews Sisters blasting from the stereo . :) 
Had a good open house . Now back to the office in order to show properties . 
If you do not love yourself totally , wholly , and fully , .... you learned not to . You can unlearn it . Start being Kind to yourself now . < PROPFEMALE > Hay 
Not only can my roommate sing , hels a damn fine cook . BBQ chicken breast with rice ... mmmmmm ...... tummy happy now .... 
Thank you < PROPMALE > Spunkmeyer for making preportioned peanut butter cookies . Only 20 minutes to peanut buttery goodness .... 
Mmmmmmmmm .... peanut buttery goodness ..... does it get better than this ? 
I can't believe that Medium is off the air ... Man I loved that show . Now what am I supposed to do with my Friday nights ... 
Oh hasten not this loving act , rapture where self and not-self meet , my life has been the awaiting you , your footfall was my own heart's beat . ~ Paul Valéry 
Previews for next week's \You've Been Cut Off\ " - they drive up to a \ " Swap Meet\ " and one of the women says \ " What's that ? \ " and one answers \ " It's like a food court for clothes . \ " LOL !!! " 
I'd almost prefer rain to fog ... 
For those of you who are familiar with < PROPMALE > McGarry from MJC , he now thinks that my roommate and I are dating . Can you imagine what he's thinking ? ' He did pretty good for himself . Don't know what she was thinking . ' 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama & people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , & focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE ... Getting back up is LIVING . Re-post if you agree , I just did . 
If you saw ME in the backseat of a police car what would you think I got arrested for ? 
Are french fries good for kitties ? 
The turn signal on the vehicle in front of me is blinking in time with the song playing on my radio . That is so cool . 
It's Bright and < PROPFEMALE > here in Ripon . Great day for an Open House ! If you're out and about stop in and say HI . 117 S < PROPFEMALE > Dr , Ripon . 
I don't understand this . There was no fog at 6:15 am when I went to swimming . Yet at 7:45 am when I left swimming you couldn't see five feet in front of you . Somebody explain this to me . 
Oh can it be true ?? Is the sun actually shining ?? Or am I hallucinating ... 
It's gorgeous outside ! It's the perfect time for an Open House and this one is a beauty . Stop in and see for yourself at 1909 Dampy Ct in < PROPMALE > ( north of Sylvan , east of Beyer High ) . 
COMPLETE BRAIN FART !! One of my old coworkers just came to my Open House and for the life of me I CANNOT Remember His Name ! Oh that's gonna bug me ... 
The sun is shining in Ripon . Why can't it shine in < PROPMALE > ? 
How did this happen ... I'm driving north on Tully on my way back to the office and there is an Orowheat truck in front of me . The truck turned right onto some street . I continued north and turned right onto Standiford and lo and behold there is another Orowheat truck in front of me . I don't think I could have planned that if I tried . And I'm fairly certain that it wasn't the same truck ..... 
Mmmmmm .... pepperminty chocolatey goodness ..... \ 
Thanks < PROPFEMALE > for my peppermint hot chocolate from Starbucks !!! 
Whatever you give a woman , she will give you greater . Give her sperm , she will give you a baby . Give her a house she will give you a home . Give her groceries she will give you a meal . Give her a smile and she will give you her heart . She multiplies and enlarges everything she is given . So if you give her crap be prepared to get A LOT OF SHIT !! real woman keep this going 
OOOWWW !!!! PAPER CUT ON THE TONGUE PAPER CUT ON THE TONGUE !!!!! \ 
I HATE LICKING ENVELOPES !!!! 
Gross ..... the aftertaste of envelope glue ..... Gross ..... 
I'm actually eating tofu chicken nuggets ... with mustard no less .... \ 
I know , right ? \ 
They're actually really good . Who knew ...? 
Turning out to be a great day today . Swimming distance is getting easier and I can feel that my shoulder muscles are strengthening . Got my Notary Commission in the mail today ( and it didn't take 10-12 weeks like every said it would ) . Now just to apologize to that someone ... It'll all be okay . 
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart . It is such a pleasure and a distinct honor to be recognized as Realtor of the Month for the North Central Valley chapter of Women's Council of Realtors . \ 
You cannot possibly know what this means to me , especially to receive it during this personal storm of mine . Words cannot express the gratitude and the love I feel for all of you right now . \ 
Thank you ! 
I love clients !! Calling and talking about everything under the sun for 2 hours !! It's such a pick me up !!

A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , post this for at least one hour ... 
I love my Mom !!! I don't say it near enough . 
WOMENS ASS SIZE STUDY ... There is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses ... the results were pretty interesting ... 30% of women think their ass is too fat ... 10% of women think their ass is too skinny ... The remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he's a good man and they wouldn't trade him for the world .... I know you're laughing !! Feel free to re-post this if you love your ass ! 
An OLD man once said There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it .

I love catching up with clients !! < PROPFIRST > , thank you for the conversation !! 
I NEED CHOCOLATE !

Doesn't make much sense , does it ? Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'm in the 1% 
Holy Cow !! So I hear this noise behind me out the window and it sounds like a broken sprinkler head shooting water into the air . I look out the window and it is absolutely pouring rain !! My goodness it's loud . 
Dollar Days at the Dollar Store ? Really ??!!??? 
< PROPFEMALE>'s twitchin ' in her sleep ... hope it's a good dream ... 
Something's watchin over me like Sweet Serendipity ... 
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world \ 
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love \ 
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart \ 
Only girl in the world ... \ 
Like I'm the only one that's in command \ 
Cause I'm the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man 
Here we go again\ 
I kinda wanna be more than friends\ 
So take it easy on me\ 
I'm afraid you're never satisfied . \ 
We're sick like animals\ 
We play pretend\ 
You're just a cannibal\ 
And I'm afraid I wont get out alive\ 
No I won't sleep tonight\ 
Oh , oh\ 
I want some more\ 
What are you waitin ' for ? \ 
Take a bite of my heart tonight 
If I had you , that would be the only thing I'd ever need\ 
Yeah if I had you , then money , fame and fortune never could compete\ 
If I had you , life would be a party it'd be ecstasy\ 
Yeah , if I had you 
It pays to be in the office at the right time and sitting where you can see the front door . I just picked up a buyer !! They drove by and knocked on the door . Woo Hoo !! 
nutter butters ..... mmmmmmm ...... 
All I wanna do\ 
Is trade this life for something new\ 
Holding on to what i haven't got ... \ 
So , picking up the pieces , now where to begin ? \ 
The hardest part of ending is starting again !! 
HOLY CRAP ! It's 11pm and I have to swim at 6:30 am . Why didn't anyone tell me !! 
Nutter Butter Break !!! 
You are more left-brained than right-brained . Some occupations usually held by a left-brained person include a lab scientist , banker , judge , lawyer , mathematician , librarian , and skating judge . \ 
The Russians would never win again ... neither would the Germans .... LOL I so want to be a skating judge when I grow up ! 
1900 yards in the pool this morning ... using mostly my upper body ... ow ... 
My vet rocks !!! 
Turlock In-n-Out has been overrun with teenagers ... and not a single dad in the bunch ... bummer ... 
Omg ... my roommate is drunk off his butt and trying to do his math homework ... which he wants me to explain to him ... OY !! 
Its not easy being a mother . If it were easy , fathers would do it . ? 
You know what would be funny .... if FB would \bruise\ " a little somewhere on peoples pages when they were poked by someone else .... \ 
You know , before the new profile thingy , we used to be able to see specifically what someone else posted on our wall . Now all I can see on my wall is the stuff I post . I want to see what someone else posted to my wall . How do I do that ?!? 
Best FB advice I've seen recently : While on FB , look at your url address : if you see http : instead of https : then you don't have a secure session and you can be hacked . Go to Account/ account settings/ account security and click change . You'll also see what devices have been accessing your account ! Copy and paste to your other friends to change their settings ! 
No one is allowed to make you feel bad without your permission . \ 
But man can they suck the life right out of you ... 
I'm going to clean up my desk , go to the library and check out a couple of books , and head home to do laundry and relax for the night . It's been an exhausting week . 
It's suddenly a great day !! Roommate's gone . < PROPFEMALE > is exploring the house . The tunes are cranked . And doing laundry is now pleasant to do . 
The weirdos are out in force today ... 
OMG ! It's a miracle !! My laundry is all washed , dried , folded , and put away . How did that happen ? 
Wow . I checked out 8 books from the library on Saturday morning . I've already read 6 of them . 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I can comment on yours as well .... Be a good sport and play along .... 4 words are harder than you think ....!!! 
This book obviously doesn't get read much . I checked it out from the library last Saturday , and if the slip I found in the book is any indication , the last time it was checked out was June 28 , 2004 . 
The cat once again wins the staring contest . I wanna know how she does it . 
Mmmmmmm .... peanut butter and < PROPMALE > crackers ..... 
I'm a full service Realtor . I bring library books to lenders . Did you enjoy your book , < PROPMALE > ? 
Do you wanna make love\ 
Or do you just wanna fool around\ 
You can take it seriously\ 
Or take it somewhere else\ 
If you want to get close to me\ 
You could do it so easily\ 
Is it love that I see\ 
When I look in your eyes\ 
Or just another empty lie 
In honor of MS awareness week , March 7th-13th , 2011 , I am asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you love has Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . I know my friends will . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found , and more awareness for CCSVI . Will you post it ? Just for one hour . Do it in the memory and the honor of those fighting MS .

How is it exactly that my dad can claim that I don't exist to him .... and yet he still sends me emails ....? 
PHEW ! 1183 emails gone through - unsubscribed , deleted , and reported as spam . Woo Hoo ! 
Being busy does not always mean real work . The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought , system , planning , intelligence , and honest purpose , as well as perspiration . Seeming to do is not doing . \

I hate this music station ..... 
1700 yards in the pool this morning and I still feel it in my arms .... it's a wonder they haven't fallen off already .... 
I've forgotten my MLS password !!! \ 
How does that happen ???? 
I have a headlamp that's out on my car . I've forgotten my MLS password . And now my phone is dropping calls due to weak signal when I have 5 bars showing . \ 
How stupid is this day going to get ?? \ 
LOL 
My day has been fixed : my headlamp is now replaced , I have remembered my MLS password , and I've stopped using my phone . \ 
NEXT !! 
CHOCOLATE !! 
Desk has been cleaned up and organized . Task list has been electronicalized . We are moving forward !! 
Did you know you can buy < PROPFEMALE > little ice creams at Target ?? It's true ! You can get < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s Cookie Dough or Haagen Dazs Strawberry . \ 
I got both .... now to decide which one to eat .... 
While I like < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , having a Sirius radio state dedicated Soley ! to what he's recorded is a bit over the top in my opinion . \ 
Since it's gettin ' on my nerves , I'm going home .... 
Miracle of miracles . My roommate is not drunk on a Friday night . He did , however , give me 30 days notice . Can't win ' em all I guess . 
When I see your face\ 
There's not a thing that I would change\ 
Cause you're amazing\ 
Just the way you are\ 
And when you smile , \ 
The whole world stops and stares for awhile\ 
Just the way you are 
Oh , oh , I want some more\ 
Oh , oh , What are you waitin ' for ? \ 
Take a bite of my heart tonight\ 
Oh oh , I want some more\ 
Oh oh , What are you waitin ' for ? \ 
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Heart beat again , \ 
Heart beat again\ 
There you go making me feel like a kid\ 
Won't you do it and do it one time ? \ 
There you go pulling me right back in , \ 
Right back in , \ 
Right back in\ 
And I know I'm never letting this go 
Dirty babe\ 
You see the shackles\

but time with you is standing still\ 
I'm waiting for you only\ 
The slightest touch and I'll feel weak\ 
I cannot lie\ 
From you I cannot hide\ 
I'm losing the will to try\ 
Can't hide it\ 
Can't fight it 
I don't say it near enough . My vet ROCKS !

Notary signings are good , but did they really have to call me at 6:40 am ?? 
RAIN RAIN GO AWAY\ 
I have to move tomorrow and I don't want my stuff getting wet !! 
I have a plan of action for tomorrow . Now all I need is a volunteer with a truck on Sunday to help me move a refrigerator .
