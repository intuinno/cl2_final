Please put this as your status if you know someone , or are related to , someonewho was killed by Voldemort or a Death Eater . Our wish is that people will understand that the Death Eaters are a band of murdering scum . The Order wants to bring peace to the ... wizarding world ...... but the Death Eaters and Voldemort continue to kill innocent civilians . ( 93% of people won't copy/paste this into their status )
