Debating whether to open my birthday presents now or on Monday .... Oh who am I kidding , I'm opening them now .

Men in dresses , women in suits , and Scottishmen all dancing to Lady Gaga . Best . Dance . Ever . 
Meara Bucklin , stop acting like my nagging wife . Love your roommate-husband < PROPFEMALE > 
Done with papers ! Only one final left and then I'm free ... 
Things I saw on my trip back from college , in no particular order : a house built into a waterfall , a lollipop with a scorpion inside it , grilled cheese without the cheese , a man carving a feather out of wood , eight ducklings , a really sweet ninety-year-old gay couple , and the hallelujah chorus < PROPFIRST > during a light show in an underground cave . All in all , a pretty interesting trip ... 
is missing someone ... several someones , actually 
was afraid it was going to rain on the parade , but instead saw a rainbow in the sky at Pride . If that's not perfect timing I don't know what is . 
wants to go home 
apparently just slept through an earthquake ... I didn't even know we could have earthquakes here until now 
no longer has a working cell phone . If you need to reach me , try skype . Also , anyone have any strategies for convincing my dad to buy me a new phone ? I've tried begging , bargaining and asking for a phone as a birthday present . I'm running out of ideas here . 
just got out of surgery . I was supposed to be sedated , but they woke me up halfway through . Apparently crying hysterically while someone's cutting a hole in your jaw is frowned upon . 
\ ... and then Zeus became a swan with a god-penis . \"" 
spent last night dancing along route 40 with Meara Bucklin , < PROPFEMALE > Gadson , and < PROPFIRST > Bateman to amuse people driving by . I love Earlham . 
\You couldn't make me feel alright if you stapled your tongue to my clit and stood on a cement mixer . \"" 
\the stench of your sexuality smells distinctly of strawberries . Tamp it down . \ " -- Meara Bucklin " 
thinks that Meara Bucklin should stop trying to be a gangsta wench . That is just wrong on so many levels . 
\I think I'm the pumpkin ! \"" 
and Meara Bucklin are talking about hip elephants and sodomy . We have the weirdest conversations in the coffee shop . 
\real men shave with chainsaws ! \"" 
has had a really bad day and needs a distraction . 
Pie . 
\I've got the magic in me ! Every time I touch myself I feel really old ! \ " -- < PROPFIRST > Bateman " 
\You are a BAMF on a sandwich ! \ " -- < PROPFEMALE > Gadson " 
learned about fellatio , dildos , and potty humor in ancient Pompeii today . Best class ever . 
needs something amazing to happen . 
\My bed is no ho ! \"" 
Off to the bungeon ! 
\A double rainbow means two unicorns are getting it on ... \"" 
\Look down at my phallus . Now look back up . My logic is now diamonds . \ " -- < PROPFEMALE > Butler "

\I don't want my vagina to look like Hitler ! \ " -- Meara Bucklin " 
< PROPFEMALE > 
is in the mood for an adventure . I want something strange and interesting to happen . 
Why is facebook spamming me ? 
felt like she was attacked by a dementor earlier today . Thank goodness she had chocolate on hand to save her ! 
One day I wanna copy someone's status word for word and see if they notice . 
\Do I know that guy ? ... Oh wait . That's my cousin . \ " -- Meara Bucklin " 
Just got locked out of my dorm ! Apparently my ID card thinks I still live in < PROPMALE > , so I can't get in to OA after midnight . Thankfully my RA walked by after a few minutes and let me in .
