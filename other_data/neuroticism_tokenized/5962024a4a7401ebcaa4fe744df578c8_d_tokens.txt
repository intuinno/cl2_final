Cadence is getting her 1st tooth in today ! I am so excitied ! 
A true friend doesn't care if you're broke , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is full of loonies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking , and they never question the friendship . Post this if you're lucky enough to have at least one of these . 
I don't understand y its so easy to put < PROPMALE > down for a nap during the day but when its time for bed it ends up taking an hour or more for him to stay in his bed and go to sleep .. 
loved you the minute I knew I was pregnant . I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , & to this day I still would ...? ? Put this on your status , if you have children you .. love more than life ... 
Cadence is crawling .. yea !! I am so excitied .. 
Ever since < PROPMALE > has been watching < PROPMALE > about how to say please and thank you , where baby bop learns how to use her manners but before she learns them she says \GIVE ME THAT\ " well now he is using those words when he wants something .. its making me mad because he never use to say those words .. Damn < PROPMALE >!"
