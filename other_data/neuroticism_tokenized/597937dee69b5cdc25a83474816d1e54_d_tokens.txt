For\ 
the rest of the month of December change your profile picture with one \ 
of a cartoon character of your childhood and invite your friends to do \ 
the same . The purpose is not to see a single human face on Facebook but \ 
an invasion of memories supporting the cause to ... ** FIGHT CHILD ABUSE ** . \ 
Pass it along )
