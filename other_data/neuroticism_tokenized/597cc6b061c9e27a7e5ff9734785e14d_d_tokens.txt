Stupid computer crashed again ... I think it has a virus ! =P Great . Just great . 
So ... I finally have no homework . Its awesome . 
Don't you just love those days that are super shitty and then a few things happen and its completely turned around ? =) 
Quick ! Help a girl out ! I need to know five words that describe me =D preferably not simple words like \nice\ " or \ " mean\ " . And I need to know if I have any particular strengths that come to your mind and if theres anything unique about me =D ( its all for recommendation letters for college .... ) " 
I love this weather =) Its finally fall ! Before you know it , its gonna be christmas ! 
I just went through over 100 emails from colleges and unsubscribed from every single one- that is easier said than done ! 
Ahhh Can't wait for the 25th =)

Ever feel like life is going by fast ? I do . Its already raining , its almost november , we're already almost halfway through senior year .... its too fast ! 
Hey ! So does anyone want to help me out ? I need people to read over my personal statement ( its for < PROPMALE >!) and tell me what they think , edit , etc . Anyone want to ?? Come on , help a girl out ;) 
So ... my english reflection ... it started out as a reflection and devolved into more of a furious rant hating on < PROPFEMALE > and the contras and all things bad that ever happened to nicaragua =S I'm kinda proud if it though ... I think blockus will love it =D 
White out tonight =D I hope the game isn't canceled and I hope UM wins ! =)

Filling out my senior memory book .... =( I can't believe the year is almost half over . 
There was a snake . In my room . \ 
Its dead now . Of lysol poisoning . and rock smashing . 
Playoffs here we come ;) 
Do you remember all the city lights on the water ? \ 
You saw me start to believe for the first time\ 
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter\ 
You're the best thing that's ever been mine . \ 
;) 
You've got to be kidding me . For UC's , middle school counts too !?! 
=) UM beat Sonora 48-14 . On to the second round of playoffs we go .... 
Off to St. < PROPFIRST>'s =) 
Why is it that my best idea for my UC essay comes to me when I least want to write it ?? =P 
Off to work in the ER this lovely evening .... ahh it doesn't get better than this ! 
I think its time to start getting in shape for tennis season ... ;) 
Hehehehe . \ 
I am so excited about September 2nd of next year . \ 
?! 
Yay ! All done with UC stuff =D 
So , i'm just throwing this out there , but has anyone been to a concert at Arco ? I've never been , but I have to buy tickets for one . And I was wondering if you thought it would be better to get floor tickets or ones for the first tier ? Or even the second tier ? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated =D 
Youknow what I've noticed ? Acoustic versions of songs are always more intense ... I like it =D 
So don't you worry your pretty little mind , \ 
People throw rocks at things that shine\ 
and life makes love look hard . \ 
The stakes are high , \ 
the waters rough\ 
but this love is ours . \ 
;) \ 
\ 
Gotta ? that < PROPFIRST > swift .

Don't you just love procrastinating ? I do . 
I only have 1 more class period of high school english- foreeeevvveeeer . \ 
This is a day to celebrate . At least for me it is ! 
Comcast On Demand has some really twisted indie slasher movies .... its disturbing .

And of course , < PROPFEMALE > christmas everyone =) Its been a < PROPFIRST > Swift-mas at the learner/brooks house =D but its fun . 
And in the spirit of the new year , I am re-doing a wall of my room ;) One wall is enough- its exhausting taking down everything and then putting up new stuff . 
Why is it on the one day I actually WANT to go running for a few < PROPMALE > or something , my gym is closed and both high schools with the nice track are either locked up or being used ? And my Wii fit isn't working . This . is . ridiculous . 
In exactly 9 months from today is the < PROPFIRST > Swift concert :) \ 
? 
I just saw Inception for the first time ... suffice to say it was an extremely weird experience . As for the ending ? It was reality , I think . Too bad all that stuff isn't real , that would be beyond amazing . Any thoughts ? I'm still trying to figure it all out =D 
Only 19 more days until we leave for Disneeeeeyland !! =D
