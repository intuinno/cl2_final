In response to something I read earlier , if I die before I come home from this save your prayers , save your hopes , just burn my body and move on , but remember how our last conversation went and if u regret your words or actions then contemplate what you should have done and don't make the Same mistake twice , none of us know how long we have , so live in a way that you will not regret

Im so angry all the time and idk why I'm always pissed everything just keeps piling up I'm gonna end up fucking someone up if this keeps up 
Is in a great mood after the last 2 days only one problem but it's not mine anymore yay me :) 
love is always patient and kind it is never jealous , love is never boastful or conceded , it is never rude or selfish , it does not take offense , and is not resentful , love takes no pleasure in other peoples sins , but delights in the truth , it is always ready to excuse , to trust , to hope and to endure whatever comes 
broke my damn nose 
Rap dad armas this song is interesting to say the least 
I will nvr understand women 
Playing with humvees :)

The sooner I get this deployment over with the sooner I can move on to something better 
Good friends are hard to find < PROPFEMALE > them

busted my knee today , hurts something fierce , hopefully its not serious though , but no way to know for sure right now , have the day off for the most part though so probly just gonna relax and try and make some of the pain go away , stupid ice patches . 
welp my knees not broken just bruised the bone , so i should be good to go in a few more days , waiting is agony , our next movement date is still up in the air weve already rescheduled twice , big green weenie strikes again :p . doing good , cant say much about whats been going on , nothing to worry your pretty little heads about , take care only 6 and a half months left , at the very least ha ha . 
smallpox sucks a big donkey < PROPMALE > :( pardon my vulgar language , i cant wait for this shit to go away , stupid vaccinations 
finally doing something its so boring over here with nothing to do :) 
finally here although cant say where here is on an open feed , if you wanna know message me , i should have the address sometime today . we have internet so i can skype and talk through facebook , will try to stay in touch , only 6 more months 8 ) , take care of yourselves , miss you all 
is busy and tired this week , lots of work which is good , cuz its going by fast , hopefully the whole deployment will go by like this , :) 
is almost one month in , this place is pretty interesting once you get used to all the crazy stuff will write again when i can , im doing good , nothing bad to report not that i would anyway :) 
wow i miss home , didnt really realize how much till now :/ oh well 6 months isnt that long 
started a new work out damn im worn out 
hey everyone so if i gave you the address , and you were planning on mailing something , dont because apparently we might be moving to a new location sometime in the next 3 weeks , if you already mailed something hopefully il get it before then . not much info on the new location , cant really say anything until i get there anyway . sry everybody :/ 
has a short day today hellz yea 
its official were moving again the dates not decided yet , but we are not needed here so were moving somewhere dif 
some people just cant help but lie , i wonder what makes these people the way they are , its a good thing im not home , im fuckin pissed 
fucking lying pieces of shit , thats two whos next , you cant take anyone on there fucking word nowadays what the fuck 
happy valentines day everybody 
ok now this deployment is really starting to get boring , come on come on something happen already , havnt done anything in over a week :( 
reliving old memories , wish i had a beer to drain in honor of the white house , god i miss those days 
money is nice but good times are better , wish i was home :P 
is really starting to get bored , this is gonna be one long ass deployment 
its sad to think that it was just 2 years ago , it feels like it was just yesterday :/ , and now everything is different , i havnt been that happy in a long time , i wish i could relive that day 
is exhausted , long day , and so many more to go 
is stoked to be moving to a new base oh yea 
is tired 
is having a really bad day , keep thinking of past things that i shouldnt , and lack of sleep and a shitty day in general are not helping 
misses beer 
can think of at least 50 things i wanna do when i get home , and the < PROPFEMALE > corp probably wouldnt approve of about 49 of them :P 
loves the new fob were at this place is legit 
i love shooting such a good way to pass time , that and working out 
long day 
is tired of afghanistan , just wanna be home with the family , and friends 
sometimes i wish i could go back to being blissfully ignorant about the world and the people in it , things were so much simpler when people could be trusted and valued , and the world still seemed like an extravigantly wonderous place , but then i look in the mirror and realize how childishly naive im being :/ 
could someone please magick me a beer right now :D pleeeeeeze 
thats twice that ive missed saint pattys day , thank god i will be home for the next one 
god the things that pop into my head sometimes 
fired RPG-7's , GP-25's and NSV's today , foreign weapons systems are the shit 
i cant wait to party my ass off when i get back , i gotta lot of time to make up for jeez :p 
might quit smoking for good this time , been thinking alot 
god I'm so tired of this place , i never thought i would say this as a generalization , maybe about an individual or two but not the whole fuckin group ,,,,, i miss women , a lot . this sucks , fuck you green weenie :((( 
ugh !!!! only 145 more days to go at the very least 
stressful situations just increase the urge to shoot someone , ironic 
i cant help but feel that i might have gone into this whole quitting smoking thing without thinking of the repercussions of being in the middle of a deployment :/ i have no doubt that i could quit , but quitting is stressful and I'm already stressed out to the < PROPMALE > do i really need something else to stress over :/ 
im a freaking exhausted :/ 
i miss my life , this is not it :/ 
\is this a test\ " 8/ " 
cant wait to go back to sleep 
gained an inch on my arms so far , and benching 40 pounds more than i was when i got here keep it up 
may not like this country but ya gotta love the sky out here at night :) 
either go on missin it , or look forward to gettin it back 
check out my motivational album , its freakin sweet 
misses everybody like crazy , nothing like being away from everyone you know to put your life into perspective , shows you who really cares and who could care less 
damn california tickets catching up to me 
If guns kill people then pencils misspell words :P 
\eating this sausage makes me feel like a vegetarian\ " LCPL Valois " 
my favorite time of year and im in afghan land so much for getting my tan on and hitting up the lake for some jet skiing , at least the scenery is nice here mountains everywhere

thank god for torrents 
love afghanland when it comes to getting in shape 
missin those little brats back home , love ya Kaylan , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > 
lightning storms in Afghanistan are freakin amazing at least 50 strikes in 2 mins 
4 colleges to choose from once i get home as of right now , UTA , UNT , UT San < PROPMALE > , or SFA ..... any thoughts on which one i should pick ??? 
dear Taliban .... why cant you all just die so me and my fellow marines can go home to our friends and families :/ 
i set up my skype account so that i can call people back home , so if you want me to call you , let me know , and il do my best theres a big time difference though so might be a little difficult to get the timing right . hope everyone is doing well though 
i think im gonna set up a gun range out at my dads house when i get back :) that would be legit 
did i ever mention how much i love shooting random ass weapons 
new work out god am i sore 
dear days .... i would really appreciate it if you would hurry the fuck up and go by , i am looking forward to going home , but i cant do that when you go by all slow like this . :/ you are really starting to piss me off 
dear sun .... can you please chill out , it is hot as hell and its not even june or july yet . 
just wanna forget the last year altogether at this point it hasnt really been that great looking back , remind me to make up for that once i get home :/
