When a nation calls its prime men to battle , homes are broken , weeping sweethearts say their goodbyes , businesses are closed , college careers are wrecked , factories are refitted for wartime production , rationing and discomforts are accepted-all for war . Can we do less for the greatest fight that this world has ever known outside of the cross-this end-time sige on sanity , morality and spirituality ? - < PROPMALE > Ravenhill 
So glad it's the weekend :) 
Secret Life ... or no ? Hmm , tough decision .. 
Maybe , just maybe , it wouldn't be so upsetting if you would just tell me the truth . Did you ever think to do that ? All of this could have been prevented if you'd just tell me the truth .. QUIT LYING TO MY FACE . I asked you for the truth , and I trusted that you would tell me nothing less , but I WAS WRONG . I can honestly say , I've never felt more betrayed by anyone . You infuriate me . 
There’s only one thing that pleases the Father .. The God-man on the tree in the midst of the scoffers .. Now I finally see that Christ is what Christ offers .. And I’m finally free in the love of the Father . 
I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW . let's all skip :) 
I don't know the key to success , but the key to failure is trying to please everybody .. 
Great Wall :) suuuuupppppper time ! woo :D 
Why does it have to be so freakishly < PROPFEMALE > outside ? WHY !? ugh . 
TGIF :)

Today was a pretty good day ! But , it is time to go to bed .. Gooodnight world :) 
Hey now , this is my < PROPFEMALE > , Consume me like a fire , ‘Cause I just want , Something beautiful to touch me , I know that I’m in reach , I am down on my knees , And waiting for , Something beautiful . -Something beautiful by NeedtoBreathe .. such an amazing song ! 
About to leave for < PROPFEMALE > ! SO PUMPED ! :D 
I need You like a hurricane , Thunder crashing , wind and rain , To tear my walls down , I’m only Yours now , I need you like a burning flame , A wild fire untamed , To burn these walls down , I’m only Yours now , I’m only Yours now , I am Yours and You are mine , You know far better than I , And if destruction’s what I need , Then I’ll receive it Lord from Thee 
Jesus you have carried me , When I could not stand , Jesus you have carried me , It's all been part of your plan , Jesus you have carried me , It's your footprints in the sand , Jesus you have carried me , It was always in your hands 
Just got home from picking up pecans all afternoon :) thanks to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > for helping ! Just need about 70-100 more pounds and we'll be good to go .. 
Hanging out for six hours , marred beyond recognition , In complete submission to the Father’s will , Still , a proclamation was made , louder than the loudest temptation , With more beauty than all His creation , More eternal than eternity , More < PROPFEMALE > than the heavenlies : “IT IS DONE . ” You are bought with blood . Accept . Rejoice . For freedom has come . 
Never condemning : You forgive , No matter where I go , No matter where I stand , Your Spirit always speaks to me , And tells me whose I am , With every breath I take , And every choice I make , My heart will always sing to You . I love You more than life itself , Lord , You are so good to me , I need You more with every breath , So won’t You breathe some life in me . 
I've had days that felt like a thousand years , And years that just fly by , I've had times I've been so sure in life , And then nothing worked out right , I put my hope in so many things I thought that I would need , But it doesn't mean anything to me . Only You satisfy , Only You are the love of my life , If I got everything I want , no , it still wouldn't do , I got a whole lotta ' nothing if I don't got You . 
My weekend is going to be packed ! woo :) can't wait . 
We are not blind We know the truth Still we don't stand Still we don't choose We'd rather stay So comfortable Stuck in our world Under control We may not pull The trigger but we Stand by and watch And pretend not to see Silence is worse Then evil done What in the world have we become 
I’ve made you promises a thousand times . I’ve tried to hear from heaven but I talk the whole time I think I made you too small , I’ve never feared you at all . If you touched my face would I know you ? Looked into my eyes could I behold you ? 
To give ourselves away for something beautiful A million < PROPMALE > away to the one who’s Hungry and thirsty and needs some hope to the people that are Weary and broken and left alone I’m giving myself away , I’m giving myself away What we do here is just the beginning New life is starting at every ending We are a part of the story unfolding This is the weight of the world we are holding This could be our day 
Some people tell me to step out and do my own thing And others say I got to blend in just to be the same And stop being me But this shallow world is no longer what I’m made of I’ve been changed by grace , I’ve been saved by love What more do I need All that matters is , all that matters is I know your love has set me free That’s all that matters to me 
procrastination is what I do best :) 
I am off to bed ! Delaney ... we will discuss these plans later :) fer sure !

Even when the rain falls Even when the flood starts rising Even when the storm comes I am washed by the water Just tryin to make the world a little better You know , shine a light People started talking Trying to hear their own voice Even if the Earth crumbles under my feet Even if the ones I love turn around and crucify me I won’t never ever let you down I won’t fall as long as you’re around me 
I just beat bubble-shooter for the first time !! :) took me long enough . haha

There are two kinds of evil people in the world ... those who do evil stuff , and those who see evil stuff being done and don't do anything about it .

Off to bed now ! :) Good day overall !! 
Christ swoops in , removes sin , picks up His bride and carries her So I can sing in agreement with the < PROPMALE > this thing : There’s only one thing that pleases the Father The God-man on the tree in the midst of the scoffers Now I finally see that Christ is what Christ offers And I’m finally free in the love of the Father . 
For the life of me , why'd You bear my chains ? For the life of me why'd You walk to Calvary ? For the life of me I can't explain The reason You died and the reason You came was for the life of me Lord , let me be so bright I escape every shadow using Your light Are You waiting to see That I will show Your life in me ? 
Technology just doesn't seem to be on my side this week . 
The nice thing about standards is , there are so many to choose from . 
Post Grad = Cute movie .. Ahh , glad I have an extra 30 minutes to sleep :) 
The times we regret are often those when we were only thinking about ourselves .. 
My little sister(who's 10 ) is sitting on the couch , with her phone , singing while listening to none other than ........ Justin Bieber . 
It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit .

Sniiiickers !

I can share the Good News with everyone I meet , dish out all the right theology , and have all the zeal in the world , but if I don’t have love for people and love for God , it’s all for nothing ... -Jimmy Needham . 
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car . 
Children seldom misquote you . In fact , they usually repeat word for word what you shouldn't have said . 
Only adults have difficulty with childproof caps ... goodness . 
If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , why are there locks on the doors ?

It has been a long day , and my bed is calling my name .. well , actually shouting it quite loudly ! :) 
If pro is opposite of con , then what is the opposite of progress ? 
Politician : One who shakes your hand before elections and your confidence after . 
Truth is under heavy attack , and there are too few courageous warriors who are willing to fight . This fight is not merely about the thrill of vanquishing some foe or winning some argument , but about a genuine love for Christ , who is the living , breathing embodiment of all that we hold true and worth fighting for . 
Who needs to still do their current event for economics ?? Ooooo ! I do , I do . :( 
Politics : If you're not outraged , you're not paying attention . 
Parents spend the first part of our lives teaching us to walk and talk , and the rest of it telling us to sit down and shut up . 
Love is like a booger . You keep picking at it until you get it , then wonder what to do with it . 
I am now covered in dirt , smelly , and exhausted , but it was definitely worth it :) 
Church in the morning :) Should probably go to bed ... 
God whispers to us in our pleasures , speaks to us in our conscience , but shouts in our pains : It is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world- C.S. < PROPFIRST >

< PROPFEMALE > Galindo I would like you to know that what you saw today in 4th period .. was actually not the worst of it all .. I gotta get out more ! LOL 
1Therefore , since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses , let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles , and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us . 2Let us fix our eyes on Jesus , the author and perfecter of our faith , who for the joy set before him endured the cross , scorning its shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God . Hebrews 12:1 -2

GLEE GLEE GLEE , is anyone not watching Glee ? haha 
Ice cream just doesn't taste the same , unless it's on an ice cream cone :) 
Facebook is like a drug , it can become highly addictive , and can also leave you feeling tired , drowsy and irritable due to lack of sleep .... this describes my relationship with facebook . 
Everyone is entitled to be stupid , but some abuse the privilege .. 
Nothing cures insomnia like the realization that it's time to get up . 
Dear Week , You are not attractive and I am leaving you for Weekend .. I'd say it wasn't you , and that it was me .. But yeah , it was you .. The weekend could not get here fast enough ! 
We'll be a dream :) 
I could spend hours trying to think of a status to say how I feel , but I realized that it wouldn't say enough :) 
what a glorious site - can you see it - looming there on the horizon - it is a wondrous thing - & it has been named - \WEEKEND\ " !!! :D "

Having trouble fitting satisfactory amounts of procrastination and productivity into a single day . Clearly we need more hours ... 
:O The Dust Bunnies have taken the Cleaning < PROPFEMALE > hostage and Mr. Clean quit on me after the Scrubbing Bubbles accidentally drowned Snuggles in the bath tub ! 
... wonders if I can get away with running around hitting people with sticks and yelling \it doesn't matter its in the past\ " :) " 
It's raining , its pouring , Facebook's gotten boring .. So off to bed to rest my head ,, but I'll probably be back in the morning .

Weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear when you get up close to them .. 
.. Understands that things happen for a reason but the reason why it happens is never really understood . 
the day is done , we've had our fun , and there's no more sun . now it's time to give up the fight , do what's right , lay down and say \goodnight ! \"" 
We make a living by what we get ,, but we make a life by what we give .
