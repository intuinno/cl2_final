Go gaels !

I never thought I would say this ... but < PROPFIRST > has a pretty good idea ... 
< PROPFIRST > just hooked it up with a sweet new ringtone . i really hope it goes off sometime for people to hear it ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody !

i like the rain , snow , and sun . I just don't like them being half and half . mother nature has gotta commit .

ugh 
is always right ... and he's also like < PROPFEMALE > claus . he sees you when your sleeping . muah ha ha ! 
the snow was magnificent . but im convinced that skiers that take up the whole run , are also the people on the freeway in minivans that won't let you pass them . you know who you are . 
she was nice . 
in the hangover , does anyone know why the guy in the trunk is naked ? lol

I'm back in the bay ... and its cold . 
a funny movie , laser tag , sushi , and a good live show . yesturday was pretty rad . 
Do you believe in rock ' n roll , Can music save your mortal soul ? 
MDT ( 815 ): You left me a five minute message of you reading Green Eggs and Ham and then proceeded to explain to me that the moral of the story was not to talk to ugly people . 
the guy from type-o-negative ? that sucks . i'm pretty sure i saw they were supposed to play somewhere soon . are you ok ? 
oops . 
Today , I got what I wanted . Thank you , day . You should be nice to me more often . 
So excited ... Not only was yesturday a good day , but I just found out FasTrak is only going to make me pay $84 of the $1000 in delinquent bridge toll between my two cars ... it takes effort to run up a tab like that in bridge toll , but a miracle to get out of paying it . 
became a fan of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Millison ... the III ? 
Eag ; es concert today . yuuuuup 
Q : What do you do if a blonde throws a pin at you ? A : Run like hell - she's got a grenade in her mouth !

“The only people for me are the mad ones , the ones who are mad to live , mad to talk , mad to be saved , desirous of everything at the same time , the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing , but burn , burn , burn , like fabulous yellow < PROPMALE > candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes \Awww ! ” " 
Someone just broke into my car and took nothing but my helllllllla old ipod ... left the fastrak in the center divide and the maui jims on the passenger seat . worst part is the fingerprints all over my window . be on the lookout for a crackhead with a burned out ipod and unwashed hands . 
I guess some guys just can't handle vegas . 
Celtics win ! oooh ... and kobe's pissed 
I'm on a boat mother****er take a look at me\ 
Straight flowin on a boat on the deep blue sea\

Hot august nights was awesome ... But now , I am < PROPFEMALE > tired

To the hercules cops in crockett : unless your fighting crime at a batman-esque level , go . we don't need meter maids . 
YUP !

Double plays all day 
Boom !

Ok , where's the celebration at ?! Haha ! Go giants ! 
Democracy shouldn't be this annoying 
When someone waits at < PROPMALE > by the platform , so when the train comes they can be the first on , then , once on , immediately moves to the next car even though there are plenty of seats , what are they looking for ? A clean one ? 
I'm tired of people expecting the world to change to toilets that don't flush to save water , cars that are slow to save gas and light that aren't bright to save electricity . If it doesn't work right , I'm going to not want to switch to it . I think a future with less pretentious environmentalists , more than pollution , would make the world a better place . Burn . 
oh weekend , why do you always leave me wanting more ? 
Walking into < PROPFIRST>'s dorm with the cancun bag : your like the < PROPFEMALE > of alcohol ! 
Google map \japan\ " to \ " china\ " and look at step 43 . " 
... just realized the main guy in evil dead is < PROPFIRST > from burn notice . lol 
I put my pants on two legs at a time like any other man , but after I put my pants on , I make gold records . 
Eww . Some ghetto ass tranny , seriously , just tried go start a fight with me in the crosswalk ... Silly Oakland
