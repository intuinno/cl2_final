I has a new phone number . If you needs it , send me a private message please . =) kkthxla 
Can't I just whore myself out to someone who is willing to finish my project for me ? I hate writing things that are already complete in my head . sigh (-_-)/ P 
Also great ! http://www.bestweekever.tv/2009-3-26/50-animals-who-hate-baths/

Wishes coding didn't make him want to scratch out his own eyes . Why can't I be a functional geek ? 
Made Vegan Meat Tonight . The texture was perfect but the flavor was not 100% convincing . I made the recipe so tweaking it won't be hard . Don't make me go vegan , I'll do it man , I'll do it ! 
Have 2 Nagilas 
Just got back from my cousin's wedding . Many thanks to everyone put the whole thing together , it was very nicely done ! The food , drink , and atmosphere were superb and the wedding party looked great . I hope < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > enjoyed their day . =) 
Aww my rant was too long = C in short , it looks like libra and virgo may have ruling planets to call their own . The demotion of Pluto to Dwarf-Planet resulted in the promotion of Ceres and Eris into Pluto's equality . Ceres sounds like a perfect fit for virgo and Eris is turning out to sound like the driving force behind libra . This means a pretty big change to my website template . =/ 
My nephew just rocked his first football game . He's a quick monkey and pretty intuitive when it comes to anticipating the other team's moves . Great game Shaunster , you got skills ! 
Its my weekend and I just nom'd some IHOP ( Mmmm paincakes ) . Today is starting off well =) 
Watched \The Phantom Tollbooth\ " and \ " Riki Tiki Tavi\ " today .. weird . " 
Yo Broseph , wanna hop in the bros-mobile , head to the bro-cery store , and pick up some bro-duce ? Rock on ! sorry i'm weird

Why do fundies piss me off so much ?

Happy B'day < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! Ahh Libra/Scorpio cusp , never has there been such a perfect combination of pretty and psycho in one place =D Hope your day is awesome ! 
<--- Has a broken computer and a sad face = C

Tay Tay in the wind ... < PROPMALE > cry fo < PROPFEMALE > . 
I love my step mom . I once asked her if she liked country music and she explained that she did , but was unable to enjoy it because it depresses her . I just realized that Mazzy < PROPFEMALE > has the same effect on me . No offense Maz , but you could make a butterfly turn to cigarettes and cutting . 
Good lyrics :

So , you are free to text or VM me anytime , but after 03/06/10 it may be a while before I actually see your message . My number is : 619-512-3445 
F-Yea'll's-I , my cell service ends on the 6th ( this Saturday ) . The number is separate from my cell though , so I will still receive messages and txts to my e-mail .
