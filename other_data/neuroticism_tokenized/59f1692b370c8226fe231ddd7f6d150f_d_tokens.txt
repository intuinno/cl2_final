Darkness will engulf you mind and body while the world will seek a place of refuge . A caged bird will sing forever long , the hymn eternal of dark and light will cause in you a terrible fight , the cage and bird are not as one , this creed can be undone , but only if the light has one , but the cage now is forever strong , the darkness is near and it can not < PROPFEMALE > . 
... To you this choice must ensue or else we parish in fires of blue . The abyss is rising to embrace the crypt , in all that is but a drip . Fly on wings of fire and ice to save this world from perilous fights , if ever you are lost in your quest of dark and light , ask of you the question of knight . 
an excerpt from my story ........ this is a prophecy , the words are from poems written by < PROPFIRST > Mcqueen 
just got her acceptance letter into the college of her dreams .... UCO here i come .... im going to be a Broncho lol ... 
But on this most auspicious of nights , permit me then , in lieu of the more commonplace soubriquet , to suggest the character of this dramatis persona . Voila ! In view humble vaudevillian veteran , cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate . This visage , no mere veneer of vanity , is a vestige of the “vox populi” now vacant , vanished . ... 
.. However , this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified , and has vowed to < PROPFIRST > quish these venal and virulent vermin , < PROPFIRST > guarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition ... 
... The only verdict is vengeance ; a vendetta , held as a votive not in vain , for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous . Verily this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose , so let me simply add that it’s my very good honour to meet you and you may call me V 
has a secret ... te-he ...

This sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting everytime\ 
And as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders\ 
catching things and eating their insides\ 
Like indecision to call you\ 
And hear your voice of treason\ 
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight\ 
stop this pain tonight 
Heading to hubby #2's house :) 
Oh I confess , I confess , to the rumour of us . \ 
Cause you didn't come and speak to me , \ 
Or put my heart at ease . \ 
And I believe that half the time\ 
I am a wolf among the sheep\ 
Gnawing at the wool over my eyes . \ 
I led the revolution in my bedroom and I set all the zippers free . \ 
We said no more war , no more clothes ! \ 
Give me peace . \ 
Oh kiss me ! 
Strawberry 
Oh Memories ! \ 
Where’d you go ? \ 
You were all I’ve ever known ! \ 
How I miss yesterday ! \ 
How’d I let it fade away ? \ 
Don’t fade away ! \ 
When money lost momentum , \ 
And the bills were piling high\ 
Then the smile had finally faded , \ 
From the apple from their eye . \ 
They were young and independent , \ 
And they thought they had it planned . \ 
Should have known right from the start\ 
You can’t predict the end . 
If I wake in the morning\ 
I only need two more miracles to be a saint\ 
Everything I promised , everyone I'd be\ 
Well I just ain't\ 
Lately it seems like\ 
Everybody's sick , everybody's tired\ 
Build myself a wall of unhappy hearts\ 
And only my heart knows my head is lying , lying\ 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > \ 
I think I see you round the bend\ 
And I think I'd try any\ 
Pose and get there in the end\ 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > - I <3 P ! ATD 
\you know you would make a very lovely speed bump ... \"" 
The powerlines went out\ 
And I am all alone\ 
But I don't really care at all\ 
not answering my phone\ 
all the games you played , the promises you made \ 
couldn't finish what you started only darkness still remains\ 
lost sight , couldn't see\ 
When it was you and me\ 
blow the candles out , looks like a solo tonight\ 
I beginning to see the light \ 
but I think I'll be alright
