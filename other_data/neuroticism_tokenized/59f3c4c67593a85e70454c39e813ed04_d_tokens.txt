Waiting .... Just waiting ... My Daughter is flying in from < PROPMALE > and I can hardly stand the wait to see her !! :) 

Just to answer the burning question ... I have never taken a bribe in my entire military/civilian career , I maintained a Secret Clearance for over a decade , worked with Law Enforcement and was Honorably Retired from both careers . One should never presume to take assumptions for fact and then put them in writing for others to take as truths . Even a stupid little questionairre can ruin a hard earned reputation . 
Can't stay on any longer ya'll Migraine is kickin too hard , Time to get into my cave and hide from the light .. 
time for yet another torture session with the PT people .. grrrrrrr ! 
Disenchantment .... that's a good word for today .. 
feeling used , unneeded , and unwanted .... I feel that to someone all I am is a source of money 
Thanks to all my friends who wished me a Happy Birthday !! I received the best present ever !! The Neurosurgeon agreed to the surgery to finally fix the busted up vertebrae in my lower back . I guess they decided that three years was long enough . lol
