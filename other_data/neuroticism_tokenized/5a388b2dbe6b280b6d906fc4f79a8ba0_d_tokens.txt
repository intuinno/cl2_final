I think I found a very old , and very special friend today on Facebook ... His name is < PROPFIRST > , and is one of the very best friends I've ever had . Let's hope it's him !! =D 

It's raining a bit right now , and I can't help but enjoy it's tapping . 
A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds .

Days and nights still backwards , just woke up . :s 
I've been in bed sick all day :( 
Just made it to < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s house 10 minutes ago - alive gratefully ! 
Watching Highlander : The Series on hulu.com =) 
Depressed - a very good friend of mine in VA lost his grandmother yesterday - my deepest condolences to you and your family . :( 
Leaving friday night around 10:30 to head to < PROPFEMALE > to see < PROPFEMALE > . I'm so happy ! -.- 
I got my Nicoderm CQ ! I begin a new smoke-free life tomorrow ! =D 
7 days smoke-free 
Most boring bday ever 
fixing my pc - fun 
I'm anxious to goto < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow , but I'm so not looking forward to the drive ! :P 
They have a kidney for < PROPFEMALE > ! She's at the hospital now with her mom and dad . Let's hope the final tests are a match ! :D 
< PROPFEMALE>'s in the O.R. _RIGHT_NOW_ , the kidney is a MATCH !! :D 
420AM surgery's done and Cheris OK ! :D 
< PROPFEMALE > is home ! Thanks , everyone , for all your support and well wishes ! 
Cutting grass on my birthday , just what I wanted ! :P

Let's see who on my friends list actually pays attention . Copy & paste this as your status . I'll be watching to see who really is . I < PROPFEMALE > family & friendships .

In God we trust , all others must submit an X . 509 Certificate . 
This week weremember all BABIES born sleeping or whom we have carried but nevermet , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones thatcame home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you orsomeone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a tabo ... 
How easy the ties can be broken , how hard it is not to come undone 
< PROPMALE > Cart Happy birthday to you ! Happy birthday to you ! You smell like a hobbit ... Happy birthday to you ! 
Facebook is being stupid slow . * sadface * 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Happy birthday , old man . 
STOUFFER'S Lasagna .. in the oven ! :D 
It's 5:05 AN . I can't sleep , but I sure can eat more LASAGNA ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Keck Will Testerman Janelynn Angulo Testerman If I could find my 70s blazer ( used to belong to DJ , the guy who gave me the bulldog - you were probably too young to remember ' < PROPMALE>' , < PROPFEMALE > ) to wear to < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding , which my grandmother made me wear to Will's and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding ( Sorry !!! ) .. I SO would ! * does the hustle * It was tan , and plaid ... I bet Will or < PROPFEMALE > still have a pic ... 
BRING QI TO < PROPFEMALE > ! Fun TV show ! 
I just got home from dropping < PROPFEMALE > off at the hospital for her splenectomy . I can't stay because I'm sick , and it wouldn't be a good idea . I honestly don't like hospitals anyway , and I would only worry even more being in that environment . I've never known anyone so strong and determined , and where I should be helping her be strong , I really think she's who's keeping me strong . I would be so weak without her . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s surgeon called me for her ; the operation went perfectly ! I am crying ! 
Heading out to go sit with < PROPFEMALE > :D 
Emo hair is not a good replacement for a safety helmet . 
You ain't got no pancake mix ! ( But you have squaids ! ) 
Why doesn't Tigger have any friends ? 
Happy 70th Birthday , < PROPFIRST > Lennon ! 
I just got home with < PROPFEMALE > ! YAY ! 
( 11:42:44 PM ) < PROPFIRST > Tennette : PWN THEM ! Cause I'm .. DOING YOUR MOM ! 
I hope I can afford the trip to my sister's wedding , I'm almost broke . The trip to and from is about $300 ( tolls , fuel , food ) , and the hotel room is another $150 . I don't even have that much _right now_ . It's so hard getting paid at the beginning of the month , and having to travel at the end of the month . 
It's not OK to be pissed off . 
COMCAST WONT FIX INTERNETS ! 
I Loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face I fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body ... Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ! ? 
OMG , my sister's wedding MUST be meant to be ! I was so worried I was going to have to borrow from the bank via my overdraft protection to make it to < PROPFEMALE > this weekend for her wedding , BUT I got a refund from the US Treasury yesterday , and I just noticed it ! 
I'm so frustrated ! We've had months of shitty internet ! Today the cable guy is coming , yet the internet is working fine today ! Of all days for the internet to be crap , why can't it be today ! :'( 
IDIOTS ! Comcast didn't come yesterday , because the lady on the phone put the WRONG EFFING PHONE NUMBER on the ticket ... Today , the lady put the right phone number , but the WRONG EFFING ADDRESS .. 30 < PROPMALE > IN THE WRONG EFFING DIRECTION ! WTF is wrong with these people ! 
Can you guys recommend an iTunes/Windows Media Player/Winamp alternative that isn't bloated , fugly or buggy ? 
? • *¨* • . ¸¸¸ . • *¨* • ? Put this on your status if you have the most beautiful DAUGHTER(s ) in the world !? • *¨* • . ¸¸¸ . • *¨* • ? 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient onlyhas one : to get better . I know 97%of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do , in honor of someone who died of or is fighting cancer 
I'm sick of being treated like shit by Comcast . They know what the problem is ( a signal/noise issue at or beyond the pole , discovered 5 times by 5 diff techs in the last year ) , and say they'll send a line tech out to fix it . We go hours everyday w/o internet , and even when we have internet , we suffer shitloads of packet loss . It's been over a year , they have our $$$ , but we still have shit for service . 
I'm always 2nd to my step-family ... no family visits me in Massachusetts ; I should just move to Tennessee . 
COMCAST IS FIXING OUR INTERNETS ! YAY .. they've been replacing line and hardware in the WHOLE neighborhood all day , and just replaced a cracked circuit board at our pole . They need to come inside soon too , to replace some line . SO HAPPY ! 
Cookies if you can solve :\

The . is not a typo . This makes no damn sense to me because of that damn little < PROPFEMALE > . 
We should just let the Republicans ' rule ' < PROPFEMALE > , with their lies and greed , until it goes to shit , then maybe the < PROPFEMALE > n people will understand . 
My internets is fixed ; I have nothing to bitch about now . :( 
I quit the guild , Disaster , tonight . I think it's the best decision I've made , where MMOs is concerned . If you don't feel at home , and don't feel like you fit in , then you probably aren't and don't . Hey , don't judge me for it , it doesn't involve or affect you . I'm doing what I want to do , with my subscription . 
Please , don't ask me to bust my ass to prep for a Raid , and to be present an hour early for a Raid , only to not take me . 
It's so great to get to speak with ol ' friends ! It made my day ! 
So , I'm giving up Lord of the Rings Online . I cancelled my subscription and it expires 25 November . I also need to rethink who my friends really are , and who I'm just a convenience to . The nature of people is to share information , and this means your secrets probably won't be kept . When a lot of people are telling me the same thing , then you probably talked too much shit behind me back . 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicap is not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . Post this and leave it as your status ? It is Special Education Week and this is in honor of ALL children who were made in a unique and loving way .

Happy thanksgiving

( 09:57:58 PM ) < PROPFIRST > Brennan : w/o the themes 
I hate it when people can't stop bitching . 
A =P (1+r/n)^(nt ) 
Of course he doesn't give a shit , cos he only gives a shit about himself . 
You're a fucking jerk , < PROPFIRST > . You want people to respect your beliefs , but you piss on everyone elses . Fuck You . 
zZzzz

All these fb games are annoying . They really ruin the whole ' social networking ' for me . 
No , Jesus wasn't born on Christmas . According to the Gospels of < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and others , Jesus was born most likely in late September , or anything but Winter . The reason we began celibrating his birth at all , and on December 25 ( as early as 236 CE ) was to accomodate for pagan converts , who celibrated natalis solis invicti and the birthday of Mithras on December 25th . 
I'm so fed up with game requests in my notifications ! 
My new years wish is to receive less game notifications . :) 
My mom , < PROPFIRST > Barbee Keck has inspired me to be less messy ! -- If she can go what's now almost 41 hours w/o a cigarette , then I can go just as long w/o a mess ! 
PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people won't post this because they've already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and ... the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post it .

Keep up the good work ! I know it's hard !

Any of you peeps use IRC ?.. minus you peeps I already know hangout on IRC . Der ! 
How do YOU define a friend ? 
People are dicks ! Police gonna honk their horn for your neighbors to move their car , but have yours towed ? And nevermind that the news website last night said there wasn't a parking ban ! There goes money we don't have ! 
So close , but unfortunately < PROPMALE > OS X 10.6 . x doesn't recognize my ICH6 , which is odd since < PROPMALE > OS X 10.6 . x is designed for that controller . 
I don't get it . People can call me and talk to me when they need someone to talk to and vent . But , when I do the same , they don't want to hear it . Oh well , I guess I don't want to hear it anymore either . Just go talk to a wall like I do . 
I don't think I should be told how I should type and speak or what language I should use when posting on facebook . My status is an expression of my thoughts and my feelings at the moment I type them and click ' Share ' . If my words , language or expressions offend you or if you just feel like nitpicking over my use of foul language , then feel free to unfriend me or filter out my news feed . 
Half the day gone already , and I gotta live in the dark and silence . Man , what a life !.. not . 
It's always great to see an old friend ! It really made my day ! 
< PROPFIRST > mailed me a bag full of 100+ coca-cola bottle caps to enter in his mycokerewards.com account . LAWL gonna be a busy morning ! 
It seems I have people mad at me , and I don't even know why ...

1/2 of the way home , about 250 < PROPMALE > to go , stopping for dinner .
