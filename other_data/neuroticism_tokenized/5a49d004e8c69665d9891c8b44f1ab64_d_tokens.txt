777- you seem pretty cool and u r a really nice person , even though we don't talk that much 
28- You are really cool , and are different from most freshman(which is a very good thing : b ) oh and btw this is itm talking , not < PROPMALE > . Haha our conversations over facebook are really funny and brighten up my day , and as you said , you too have an amazing smile 
13- I don't know you all too well . But you are a really nice and artistic person . We don't talk much anymore but it is really cool when we do . 
925- I never know you all to well , but you always seemed like a really cool and calm guy 
321.123 - according to some people we look a lot a like , well when i had long hair . I will always remember our hand spider thingys that we started 
16- I haven't talked to you in awhile . Its been since freshman year i believe . We used to text all the time . i always wondered why we stopped talking 
21- You were kinda hard to right for . It took me awhile to think of what to say . You have always been extremely nice to everybody and there is are other things to say but i can't think of them right now(they are good things though ) I do wish we talked more though 
404-I don't see why people seem to be annoyed by you . People aren't perfect but i guess people gotta hate . You are my friend and ill back you up my best . 
555-9292- The fact that you seem to have chosen a phone number say a lot haha . You have always been a great friend even if you are always injecting me with nanomachines : b but im glad I met you cuz you are awesome 
17-THIS FOR MY TWIN BROTHER TYLOR , I SAID I WASN'T GOING TO WRITE ON FOR HIM AND HE KEPT BUGGING ME SO I ANOUNCED IT TO THE WORLD THAT TYLOR CHOSE THE NUMBER 17 
781113- im not sure when we first became friends , it was either middle freshman year or early sophmore year , im not sure though , but then again im dead tired : b . That cake your mom made was really good , even though it wasn't really cake , just globs of it .... idk what im saying , goodnight ! 
12- I've known you since 4th grade , and the fact that you gave me the nickname i hate the worst i will never forgive you : b haha you are still one of my best friends though , but still you will be , NEVER FORGIVEN !! 
This is the last one\ 
77- I've known you for 5 years and you are like a brother to me . We don't talk much anymore which makes me pretty sad . I know your birthday is in 5 days . And for some reason i laughed when i saw you chose the number that you did . I forgot that that is your number for everything . 
26-You are like as close or closer than my brothers . You got me through a lot of things and you were always there for me . I started to fall apart in a way when you left . I really miss you and i was glad i got to see you when you came back 
urg . the freaking fire alarms keep going off 
Always forgive your enemies . Nothing annoys them so much . \
