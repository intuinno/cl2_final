“I’ll tell you what I do want . I want someone who will be monogamous , and nice to his mother . And I want someone who likes musicals but knows to just shut his mouth when I’m watching Lost . And I want someone who thinks being really into cars is lame and strip clubs are gross . I want someone who will actually empty the dishwasher instead of just taking forks out as needed , like I do . I want someone with clean hands and feet and beefy forearms like a damn Disney < PROPMALE > . And I want him to genuinely like me , even when I’m old . And that’s what I want” -- < PROPFEMALE > Lemon\
