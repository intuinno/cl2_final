and i feel like i can fly\ 
when i stand next to you <3 
occupying myself all day , then work tonight . 
I was the one you always dreamed of , You were the one I tried to draw . How dare you say it's nothing to me ? Baby , you're the only light I think I ever saw . <3 
follow me and you will never have to wish again <3 
I bet if I give all my love then nothings gonna tear us apart <3 
fun day <3 :) 
One mile to every inch of\ 
your skin like porcelain <3 
\i am watching over you from the stars 
always know in your heart\ 
that you are far bigger than \ 
anything that can happen to \ 
you . <3 
staying in < PROPMALE > tonight , JM concert tomorrow in Cincinnati . \ 
\ 
You don't get another chance , \ 
Life is no Nintendo game <3 
& how many times can I break till I shatter ? <3 
< PROPFIRST > Mayer tonight . 3rd row :) <3 
& i'm livin ' life now that i'm freeee <3 :) 
but your temper's just as bad as mine is you're the same as me\ 
but when it comes to love you're just as blinded <3 
going to work . then hanging out :) 
i’m alive again ; more alive than I have been in my whole entire life <3 
& no one knows why i'm into you , cause you'll never know what its like to walk in our shoes <3 
:) <3 
Of all the things i still remember summer's never looked the same the years go by and time just seems to fly but the memories remain <3 
Thinkin about us , what we gonna be ? Open my eyes , yeah ; it was only just a dream . 
i've learned that goodbyes always hurt , pictures never replace having been there , memories good or bad will bring tears , and words can never replace those feelings ? 
Yeah , I call it how I see ya I wish I never met ya , I wouldn't wanna be ya :) 
& now i'm starting to see maybe it's got nothing to do with me . 
so tell them haters cut it out like a coupon :) 
if everyone was like you the world would be a better place :) <3 
your body is a wonderland i'll use my hands <3 
you take away the old , show me the new , and i feel like i can fly when i stand next to you <3 
your faith is strong , but i can only fall short for so long , down the road , later on you will hate that i never gave more to you than half of my heart <3 
you and i will be young forever <3 
find someone that can make you smile and don't give up on them :) <3 
how dare you say it's nothing to me ? baby , you're the only light I ever saw . <3 
why does it take a minute to say hello and forever to say goodbye ? 
good friends we have had , oh , good friends we've lost along the way <3 
but i'm on the outside and i'm looking in , i can see through you see your true colors cause inside you're ugly , you're ugly like me <3 
Cruisinggg :) 
Swagga so bright i dont even need light :) 
you're only as tall as your heart will let you be , and you're only as small as the world will make you seem <3 
Stuck on the interstate in a blizzard . Yay . 
there's something that i can't quite , explain\ 
i'm so in love with you\ 
you'll never take that away <3 
taco < PROPFEMALE > <3 
to the world ; you may be one person\ 
but to one person ; you may be the world <3 
it's probably not a good idea to be so pathetic and desperate when you're that ugly ;) 
but I know one fact i'll be one tough act to follow <3 
With my favorite people <3 
ill be up up and away\ 
up up and away\ 
cause they gon ' judge me anyway\ 
so whatever <3 
spending the day and night with my friends . glad 2010 will be over it was a horrible year :) 
T.G.I.F. <3 
am i still your charm , or am i just bad luck ? 
we were both 16 & it felt so right ; sleeping all day staying up all night <3 
well expect me to be calling you to see\ 
if you're ok when i'm not around\ 
asking if you love me\ 
i love the way you make it sound <3 
wow reading all of my old statuses from 2010 made me sad . soooo much has changed <3 
i wish i never had to go back to school . 
and all of these emotions of mine keep holding me \ 
from giving my life to a rainbow like you <3 
down the road , later on\ 
you will hate that i never gave more to you\ 
than half of my heart <3 
;) 
no regrets <3 
Good day :)
