At this point my brain began to eat itself because it had run out of things to do and my only thought wasn't a thought , it was the colour red ... 
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing . 
You'll never find your gold on a < PROPFIRST > beach . You'll never drill for oil on a city street . I know you're looking for a < PROPFEMALE > in a mountain of rocks , but there ain't no Coup de Ville\

Many tales to tell about Saturday night ... 
? Without a thought , without a voice , without a soul ... \ 
Don't let me die here ; there must be something more ? 
Iwant to love you , but I better not touch ; I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop . \ 
I want to kiss you but I want it too much ; I want to taste you , but your lips are venomous poison . 
to relax my mind i take a walk by the clock and i pass the time and\ 
rhymin , mathematic timin , syntax impacts the intact hymen . 
I tried to build a wall and let nobody in . To be on my own , without love and without pain . \ 
I don't know why , but every time I look into your face , I am caught and I relapse again . 
< PROPFIRST > Cox and I navigated the < PROPFEMALE > Corn Maze at night ... It was good !!! 
Happy Halloween guys !!!!! 
So many things I could say about tonight ... but I'll just keep that between us . 
The deed has been done . May a newer , brighter , chapter begin . 
Everywhere I go I am spellbound , I will break the spell you put on me . 
I'm driving down my way , to digest yesterday . Under rain clouds towards the sundown to be devoured , and then come out alive . Dripping wet , but purified ; ready to bear the memories of < PROPFEMALE > hours . 
I looked in the light , I sat in your coal mine . I sank in the well of my mind , too deep , never to be found , but I found the key I needed to set me free . Do you even know that I am gone ? 
? For those about to rock ; we salute you , cuz it's a long way to the top , if you wanna Rock n ' Roll ?

9x-7i > 3(3x-7u ) ... 
The wind of change blows straight into the face of time ; like a stormwind that will ring the freedom < PROPFEMALE > for peace of mind . 
Just ask yourself ; are they worth the effort ? If not , make peace with yourself and move on . 
God damn Breaking < PROPMALE > crashed my flash player >:( 
Cordiality doesn't equal friendship ; just because someone is nice to you doesn't mean they like you . 
\Selling them whiskey and taking their gold . Enslaving the young and destroying the old . \ " Happy Thanksgiving everyone . ( Remember what you did ) " 
Ladies first , men with skirts second . 
Someone named Mr. Cauliflower decided to start The Church of the Holy Cabbage , with the slogan \lettuces pray . \ " I face-palmed and burned it to the ground . The End " 
Just watched \The Girl Next Door\ " and liked it . Should I be worried ? " 
You see , kids , dentists are your friends . And if you ignore your \ 
friends , you could wind up in serious pain . Right , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ? 
History final done . Too easy . Asistance from < PROPFIRST > Cox . 
Let the winter sun shine on ; let me feel the frost of < PROPFEMALE > . Fill my dreams with flakes of snow ; soon I'll feel the chilling go . 
Will i find a way , will i find a place ; will you let me go in peace . Leave behind those dark days ; now i ask again , will you hear my cries . Then you realise why oh why . I must find a way to the other side
