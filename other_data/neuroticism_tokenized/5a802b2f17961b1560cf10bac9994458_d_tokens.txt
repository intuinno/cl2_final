There comes a time in life when you have to let go of all the pointless drama , so surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus on the good . After all life is to short to be anything but happy XD ! 
Life is like an hourglass ... eventually , everything hits the bottom and all you have to do is wait it out until someone comes along and turns it around =D 
Laugh your heart out Dance in the rain < PROPFEMALE > the moment Ignore the pain Live , Laugh , Love Forgive and Forget Life's too short to be Living with regrets 
HAPPY B-DAY < PROPFIRST > =D =D =D =D =D =D
