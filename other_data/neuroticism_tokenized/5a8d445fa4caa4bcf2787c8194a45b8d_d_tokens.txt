Stayin home alone on a Friday . Flat on the floor looking back , on old love , or lack thereof . After all the crushes are faded , and all my wishful thinking was wrong . I'm jaded . I hate it ... Searchin all my days just to find you . I'm not sure who I'm lookin for . I'll know it , when I see you . Until then , I'll hide in my bedroom . Stayin up all night just to write , a love song for no one . 
my arm feels like its gonna fall off . 
get better soon man , you're in my prayers . 
Girl , There's something about me that you ought to know I've never felt the need to loose control Always held on back and played it slow But not this time . Baby dont be gentle , I can handle anything Baby , Take me on a journey I've been thinking lately , I could use a little time Alone with you Crazy , Let's do something , maybe Please don't take your time You got me right where you want me

everyone around me is so opinionated . they see one thing wrong in someone , and even if they dont know the person , they hate them . i just dont understand why we are so quick to judge people with negativity , and hardly ever with positivity . 
two wrongs dont make a right . no matter how you look at it . 
Boise State !!!!!!

Right Above It - Lil < PROPMALE >

I don't want to be anything other than what i've been trying to be lately . All I have to do is think of me and I have a peace of mind . I'm tired of lookin ' ' round rooms , wondering what i've got to do , or who i'm supposed to be . I don't want to be anything other than me .

Put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from being a < PROPFIRST > Cowboys Fan . Being a Cowboys Fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for DCF and sympathy does not help but can raise awareness . 90% of Cowboys fans won't repost this because they don't know how to copy and paste 
alright , Bullis , lets get that win tonight !!!!!

I grew up reciting this every morning in school . It is a shame we no longer do ..... for fear of OFFENDING SOMEONE ! Let's see how many < PROPFEMALE > NS will re-post this and not care about offending someone !!!!

STEELERS ! 
Can't wait to go skiing for the first time in 7 months this weekend !!!!!!! 
All Bullis wants for the holidays is a JV Hockey win tonight under the lights , primetime , at Arc , at 8:10 , at Churchill . If you support this worthy cause we ask you to repost this status .
