Aquarius horoscope for September 15 , 2009 You are optimistic in a way that can prevent you from facing important though unpleasant facts . Instead , you must have a can-do attitude while handling complexities and disappointing developments ...... Great , how uplifting 
Aquarius horoscope for September 17 , 2009 An issue that's important to you is under subtle attack . Be sure that people are who they say they are . Deceptive advertising , false covers are used to deceive you where you care most . ? Soundz like those damn haterz are @ it again ! 
If you're not paying attention to the game - don't play it ! 
Aquarius horoscope for September 20 , 2009 You can give too much attention to broad topics of philosophy or distant places , which have little bearing on the challenges in front of you . You need to focus on tasks that you want to put off but should not . 
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
Iz too old for SPY games , if ya wanna know something just ASK me .....

just want it all to go away ........................ 
Damn , looks like everyone is on facebook tonight ! Hello all ! 
Maybe its just the way I think but .... when you gotta tell lies about someone else in an attempt to make yourself look better , then u might as well cheat when your playing SOLITAIRE .... cuz they are both pretty pathetic 
January 21 ~ February 19 You can't escape your history and you can't run from your past -- wherever you go , you'll have to deal with both . The worst part of it is , you're starting to realize where it all went wrong . € Realizing was never my issue , I juz couldnt accept it . Damn , truth hurts thats for sure 
January 21 ~ February 19 ? Releasing those emotional chains will help you discover something new -- that's why it's a great day to free yourself from something or someone that's been bothering you ... ? its been a long time comin anyway .... consider it done 
Aquarius horoscope for October 19 , 2009 You are feeling that action is required regarding your job or career . Daring plans can be on your agenda . It's important to be assertive without cutting down others for their perceived defects . 
Aquarius- Nothing is simple for you -- ever -- you make sure of it ! You can't decide if you're grumpy because you have too much alone time or not enough . Either way , you just don't like the company you're keeping . 
To change fb back to the old way .... go to the left side menu , click ' more ' , drag Status update to the top and then click on Staus update and then you should be back to the old way ... 
Aquarius horoscope for October 29 , 2009 You expect things to come easy when in fact you need to demonstrate initiative . Don't put your hopes on someone else ; if you want something , take the responsibility .

Put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered BABY LOSS . ??? The majority won't put it on , because unlike cancer , baby loss is a taboo . ??? Break the silence . ??? In Memory of all the ~ Angel ~ babies gone too soon but never forgotten about !! ?

this is the rest of the meaning that it didnt post : Like the summer months it represents , this card reflects family , \ 
holidays , and a sharing of good times with loved ones . The negative \ 
association might mean delays , bad judgment or an inflated ego . The sun \ 
is powerful enough though that even if there are some negative \ 
associations , the person will pull through with a happy ending . 
hmmmm ..... Broccoli Beef & Egg Rolls for dinner it is !! 
Just chillin , shootin sum pool in da basement ..... damn its been awhile , need to brush up on my skills !!! \

Until Monday ( Dec 6 ) next week , we hope to see less human faces on Facebook , and instead , an invasion of childhood memories This is for awareness of Violence against Children , a ... great cause ! 
Why isnt facebook sending me notifications ?!?! How the hell am I supposed to know whats goin on when I got +700 people on my friends list ?!! They better fix whatever they messed up when they switched to these messy lookin , cluttered profiles . Cuz w/out notifications facebook is pointless !!
