Luv is the capacity 2 take care , 2 protect , 2 nourish . If u are not capable of generating that kind of energy twd urself- if u are not capable of taking care of urself , of nourishing urself , of protecting urself- it is very difficult 2 take care of another person . In the Buddhist teaching , it's clear that 2 luv 1self is the foundation of the luv of other ppl . Luv is a practice . ~ Thich Nhat < PROPFEMALE > 
Had one of the most well-rounded weekends in a long time . Celebrated a 21st Bearthday w/ my cuz ... a 50th with my uncle ... kicked it with my baby ... and even attended an Akan service at the shrine with some beautiful and powerful women .

4 the past 8 mo I've been living in DC w my entire life in Decatur , GA ( birth cert , passport , clothes , shoes , books , music , etc . etc . ) . I came 2 DC in Jul w a week's worth of clothes ( 4 summer of course ) ... I survived autumn , winter , rain , & 2 snow storms w what I had ( w the exception of a coat that was purchased 2 get me thru the winter months ) ... 
... Frm the whole experience I learned 2 very valuable lessons : 1)All this STUFF we have , that we think we need ... we really don't . 2 ) Life can change in the blink of an eye ... Appreciate where u r in life & take NOTHING 4 granted . Learn 2 live w/o the STUFF , & ur happiness will truly come from w/i . When it comes from within ... no1 or nothing can take it away ! ATL HERE I COME ... GET READY FOR ME !!!!!!! 
Today's Mantra : \I release my perception of what ' beauty ' is & allow my inner Beauty ; my true Radiance to SHINE through . I AM RADIANT ! \"" 
Mentally preparing 4 my client later .. love putting $$$$ in the bank .. but I luv helping ppl transform more #believeitornot ... http://bit.ly/7Dzldl 
Maybe I don't understand a lot , but I understand that blowing my tax returns on gadgets and things , when there are myself and bills to be paid , is STUUUUUUUUPID !!! Pay YOURSELF FIRST ... buying software and laptops might be treating yourself , but it's def not paying yourself ... it's paying Serato and Apple . 
\Focus on understanding yourself instead of blaming others\ " ~ Wayne Dyer " 
I try not to let impatient people get under my skin , but DAMN !!!!!!!! Ya'll aren't the only ones who have things to do ; you're not the only ones who value YOUR time ... time is circular , not linear ... get wit it !

Just woke up for the day .. don't judge me lol .

I appreciate ( with my whole heart ) all the wishes , gifts , laughs , cards , songs , memories , love , and positive energy . It was a small price to pay ( abt 2hrs ) for all the love I received . Hugs & Kisses 2 you all !!

If you had to have surgery , would you entrust someone who has not attended medical school , but has been performing surgeries for the past 10 years , who learned through hands-on experience from someone who's been performing surgeries for 50 years ... OR would you go with the resident surgeon who finished med school , but is still in her/his \learning stages \"????????"

< PROPFEMALE > K Stevens and < PROPFIRST > E Stevens Jr WOW !! Don't know how you communicate ur open marriage so calmly to sleepwalkers ... my goodness ... I would have a stroke on air . I give thanks 4 u 2 ! 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > E Stevens Jr. .. ding ding ding ... people are afraid to deal with their issues of jealousy , self-worth , self-esteem , insecurity , etc . etc . etc . etc . That's really why people don't want to touch the subject of open relating or Progressive Love !!! Grow , expand ... life really does get better ! 
Under what circumstances should beggars be allowed to choose ?? Should they be allowed ? 
That which we fear/resist ... persists ... every time !

I'm so tempted to post a pic , but I'll spare u .. My schnookums just did # 1 & 2 ON THE TOILET !! He's 5 MONTHS old !! #Eliminationcontrol #EC 
So based on responses 2 the question I posed a couple wks ago about marriage .. seems 2 me that marriage is not a religious institution at all , but rather a financial/legal one ?! Am I clear on this ? Is this what it is ? 
Breastfeeding deserves just as much aggressive marketing & promotion as formula feeding . U can't open a parenting related magazine , or many other magazines , w/o seeing an ad &/or coupon 4 formula . I get a coupon everytime I check out at Kroger . Yesterday the lady in front of me gave me her formula coupon ... stay tuned 4 my aggressive promotion of breastfeeding works via < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > //staying tuned !!

Learning how to be unapologetic about who I am ! 
Riddle me this : Feelings come from within correct ? So why do we look to people or things outside of ourselves to change or blame for how WE feel ?? We're more powerful than we know/believe ! 
Food is calling me ... real food .. not processed , in a can , genetically modified , frozen , in a box , delivered or carried out poison ... but FOOD/medicine/nourishment !! Any suggestions ?? I'm so hungry I can't think . 
At a tennis match .. Serena's supposed to be playing .. I hope that makes it more enjoyable . #notbigonsports :-/ 
Since when did tennis have cheerleaders ?? 
< PROPFEMALE>'s legs actually look a lot bigger than her butt . Hmm .. I wonder if the media portrays her like a big butt purposely ?! Maybe she lost weight .. maybe I'm analyzing 2 much ... maybe I really don't give a $@ ! % .. disregard lol

What's the purpose of sports ???

I think I hear Miami calling me back !!!!! :-( 
Peace . 
Experimenting ... making my own flavored aloe drink !! We shall see . 
Understand there is a difference between Tantra and Tantric Sex . Tantra is a way of living and perspective towards life . Spiritually weaving all the different parts into one whole . Tantra may or may not include sexual intimacy with another . But you must become spiritually intimate with yourself and life !! ( DM ) via < PROPFIRST > Mooney 
Question : Why do the majority of women in < PROPFEMALE > trust doctors , who've never seen/attended a normal , natural birth , to provide them with care that would lead to a normal , natural birth ? It's like a healthy , fully able bodied person going to a physical therapist when what they need is a personal trainer ! 
Don't understand how people think cologne/perfume smell good . Don't u smell all the chemicals ... don't ur heads hurt after 2 squirts ?! Sheesh .. lighten up .. body odor/pheromones are not the real killers ! 
Happy National Book Week ... There's a book out there for everyone ... even those with hearing and vision disturbances ... there's no excuse ! 
It amazes me how black slaves in < PROPFEMALE > were sold & disposed of & mistreated as if they were things . How could 1 look at them .. see them breathing , eating , working , crying when mistreated & consider them less than , or look at them as things ?! How can we , today , do the same 2 animals ?! Smh .. have u noticed it's the same treatment ? 
When family or friends ask for a donation or support ( monetary or otherwise ) do you judge the cause as to whether or not you'll support , or do you support ( in some way ) no matter what ??

Many of u black males are angered by black women choosing 2 date & marry outside of u not because u have our best interest @ heart , but because u think that we belong to you . Don't you get it ? You can't claim ownership over nature . We are not your cattle nor sheep . WE ARE THE PRIMORDIAL OPENING FROM WHICH ALL EXISTENCE IS MADE MANIFEST !

LOL .... SO SAD ... Please put this on your status if you know or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a stupid person right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity and sympathy does not help . Sometimes a 2x4 to the back of the head helps , but not a lot .

In the presence of such greatness right now at the Congressional Black Caucus prayer breakfast ! Dr. < PROPFIRST > Dyson is my only concern right now :-) He WILL know who Sunshine is before I leave here today !! 
Soooo , I ran into Omarosa who is my former pageant coach for Miss Teen DC ( yea I did a pageant ) and we're hopefully going to coordinate some volunteer opps for me .. AND Dr. Dyson knows who Sunshine is :-) He was so moved by how moved I was to meet him that he gave me a big ol ' hug , his number , and email ! About to go set up a lunch date with him now ;-) #lifeisbeyondgrand #askandyeshallreceive 
Headed out of town AGAIN ! Not complaining ... just sayin ' :-)

Asking some Women if they want more is an insult in their eyes . That's because we have been trained to see Motherhood as a burden , rather than a joy , an honor , and a privilege . We are told haunting tales of excruciating pain , unwanted stretch marks , and irreversable weight gain . Women , guard yourselves from such negative feminine hate speech and phobias . Surround yourselves with positive , powerfu ... l , Mothers who turned their pain into wisdom . Who have mastered the womb from excercises to soothing breathing techniqes . Who know how to shapeshift by way of fitness and proper eating habits . Childbirth is a restorative , replenishing , and rejuvenating process . Endure it with an open mind and the company of those who compliment LIFE ! Now , shall we procreate ? Indeed we shall ..... responsibly and joyfully . ~ Ebony Imhotep 
Examining & altering our thoughts is not about having a positive attitude .. it's about changing our beliefs on a subconscious level , which in turn changes our attitude & physical states . This is real medicine ! I don't understand people who are so willing to try every medicine & therapy under the sun , but won't try to understand & change thr thoughts . What do you have to lose in trying ??? It's free , & IF it doesn't work , which it will ... how will it have affected you negatively ??? You won't get <3 palpitations , a rash , fever , hives , cold sweats , insomnia , drowsiness .. it won't increase suicidal thoughts ( wellll ... nevermind ) , so yea , what's there 2 lose besides beliefs that don't serve ur highest self ?
