My men's Special Olympics basketball team lost our first tourney game yesterday . The other team had a guy that dunked on us 3 times . One was off of a missed foul shot ... he had to turn his head to not hit the rim . Most AMAZING thing I have ever seen in Special Olympics basketball . He could play on our < PROPMALE > Macker team ... how is he on the Special Olympics team . I should have protested his paperwork ... LOL ! 
It's March Madness time again !! I will be running an online pool again this year . I got a new computer , so I do not have everyone's email address that used to get in my annual March Madness pool . For those of you that want to get in this year , send me an email to austint@columbus.rr.com I want to get 300 players this year . Top 3 places win . I will be sending out the weblink on Monday . 
My favorite time of year is here ... March Madness . If anyone wants to get in my pool , send me an email at coachtracyaustin@gmail.com . I will send you the information about the pool and the link to make your picks and where to send your $ . Only serious March Madness enthusiasts needed ! 
OMG , OU up by 12 right before the half . That's why I love March Madness . You just gotta play the game . 
One of the best opening rounds of March Madness that I have seen for a long time ! Great games and buzzer beaters . Can OU do it again ? 
My boy < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > led his Harvest Prep Lady Warriors to the STATE CHAMPIONSHIP game win today by 3 points . There were down by 18 at one point !!
