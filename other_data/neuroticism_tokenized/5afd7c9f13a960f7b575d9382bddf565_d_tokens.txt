Unfortunately I need to find a better home for our Rhodesian Ridgebacks . With our traveling schedules we aren't able to properly care for our dogs . Both are pure breeds , we have a male who is 16 months and the female is 6 months . We'll be giving the dogs away for free but only to a good home . For more details inbox me .
