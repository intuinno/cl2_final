Does anyone else have a cat with two eyes(Well , I would hope so ) and one of them is normal(Hopefully ) and the other one's pupil is three times the normal size that it should be and after she blinks a couple of times it returns back to normal and her eye is a little red but then she will blink a few more times and it will change again ?
