Pink - Can't Take Me Home - Most Girls <3 
u . u ; So . I actually did something right in my math and I was all proud of it , then Mom comes home and just HAS TO pick at the little thing I did wrong in some other part of the problem . Doesn't even comment about the stuff I did right that I've been having trouble with . Sigh ... 
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare , either way I don't wanna wake up from you . I mention you when I say my prayers , I wrap you around all of my thoughts . Boy , you're my temporary high . I wish that when I wake up you're there , to wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side . 
I can't run anymore , I give myself to you . I'm sorry ... I'm sorry . In all my bitterness , I ignored all that's real and true . All I need is you . When night falls on me , I'll not close my eyes . I'm too alive , and you're too strong . I can't lie anymore , I fall down before you . I'm sorry ... I'm sorry . 
Most girls want a man with the bling-bling , got my own thing , got the ching-ching . I just want real love . Most girls want a man with the mean green . Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream up , a man that understands real love . 
She's got her daddy's money , her momma's good looks , more laughs than a stack of comic books . A wild imagination , college education , add it all up it's a deadly combination . She's a good bass fisher , a dynamite kisser , country as a turnip greeeeen . She's got her .. daddy's money , her momma's good looks , and look who's lookin ' at me ~ 
This world keeps spinning faster to a new disaster so I run to you , I run to you ~ ^^ Yay for Lady Antebellum .

Cowgirls don't cry . Ride baby ride . Lessons in life are gonna show you in time . Soon enough you're gonna know why . It's gonna hurt every now and then , if you fall get back on again , cowgirls don't cry . 
I believe I can see the future , cuz I repeat the same routine . I think I used to have a purpose , but then again , that might've been a dream . I think I used to have a voice , now I never make a sound . I just do what I've been told , I really don't want them to come around , oh no . Every day is exactly the same , every day is exactly the same ~ There is no love here , and there is no pain . Every day is exactly the same . 
I hate history . =3

Off to Dessy's house ! =3 Yay . Hocus Pocus on at 6 tonight on ABC Family channel ! =DDD Yay !!!!!! xD 
Rawr ._. 
If you love someone you would be willing to give up everything for them , but if they loved you back they'd never ask you to . They say loving you gives pains and full of sacrifices . But I'd rather take pains and lots of sacrifices than not to be loved by you . A wise girl kisses but doesn't love , listens but doesnt believe , and leaves before she is left . I guess I'm stupid . 
If I know what love is , it is because of you . - To the world you are one person , but to one person you are the world- Let's commit the perfect crime , I'll steal your heart and you'll steal mine . - You are what I never knew and what I always wanted . 
Once a long , long time ago , all people had 4 legs and 2 heads , then the gods threw down thunder bolts and split everyone into two . Each of them had 2 legs and 1 head , but the separation left both sides with a desperate yearning to be re-united because they each shared the same soul . And ever since then , all people spend their lives searching for the other half of their soul . 
Love is just a word until you find someone to give it a definition . 
Sigh ... xP * Huggles pillow tight and nuzzles it * u.u I wish it was her ... 
It's Sundayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ~~~~~~ * Glares at clock * Go mo fasta !!! DX

Is it bad that I look outside , see grey skies and it's raining lightly(almost like a mist ) ... and think , \Wow . That's beautiful . \"?" 
So ... I took this quiz ... which Twilight character am I ... and it said I'm < PROPMALE > Hale . WTF ????? I don't even like < PROPMALE > ! D= You are < PROPMALE > Hale . You are very charismatic and have an uncanny ability to put others at ease . You are also a dependable leader and intuitive friend . You have a hard time ignoring temptation , as you are not naturally inclined to repress the way you feel . 
Soooooooo tired . u.u ; Spent like five hours at the barn doing jumping . Or < PROPFEMALE > and I took turns trying to jump Dreamer , aka , me getting on and showing her how to get him over the jumps . >.>; Not that hard . She's just not making him do it . Ashlei brought Chief over and she was jumping him bareback . =3 I'm so proud . * Yawn * Mmm . Tá grá agam duit , Muirnín . Oíche maith . G'night , all ! 
Happy Halloween ! 
I can't escape this hell . So many times I've tried , but I'm still caged inside . Somebody get me through this nightmare , I can't control myself ! So what if you can see the darkest side of me ? No one will ever change this animal I have become . Help me believe it's not the real me , somebody help me tame this animal ! 
Happy Samhain . =3 
* Watches Transformers * o.o ... 
CHOCOLATE MAKES YOUR SOUL HAPPY . EAT THE CHOCOLATE . IT'S GOOD FOR YOU . 
Good morning ... 
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you ? Why'd you turn away ? Here's what I have to say . I was left to cry there waitin ' outside there grinnin ' with a lost stare . That's when I decided ... Why should I care ? Cuz you weren't there when I was scared , I was so alone . You ... you need to listen . I'm startin ' to trip , I'm losing my grip , and I'm in this thing alone . 
So , because it should be known that you love me , you shouldn't have to say it anymore . Well , I'm sorry if I like hearing that you love me . 
She's a Saturn with a sunroof with her brown hair a-blowing . She's a soft place to land , and a good feeling knowing . She's a warm conversation that I wouldn't miss for nothin'~ She's a fighter when she's mad and she's a lover when she's loving . And she's everything I ever wanted ... and everything I need . When I talk about her , I go on and on and on ' Cause she's everything to me . 
I can the rain on the roof of this empty house , that don't bother me . I can take a few tears now and then and just let ' em out , I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while even though goin ' on with you gone still upsets me . There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay , but that's not what gets me ... 
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose , if I'm not that arrow to the heart of you ... If you don't get drunk on my kiss , if you think you can do better than this then I guess we're done . Let's not drag this on , consider me gone . 
Am I not fucking good enough for you ??? God damn ! Fuck you and and and just FUCK YOU ! I'm sorry I can't be fucking perfect ! 
Spent aaaaaaaallllllllllll day with teh horses today . From 7:30 A.M. to 5 something P.M. ._. Home ! Food ! Computer ! Haha .

Can't you see that you're smothering me ? Holding too tightly , afraid to lose control . Cuz everything that you thought I would be has fallen apart .. right in front of you ~ Every step that I take is another mistake to you ... And every second I waste is more then I can take ! 
On my knees , I'll ask , last < PROPMALE > for one last dance . Cuz with you , I'd withstand , all of hell to hold your hand . I'd give it all , I'd give for us , give anything but I won't give up ! Cuz you know , you know , you know ... I love you , I have loved you all along . And I miss you , been far away for far too long . I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'd never go . Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore ...

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you , or tell you that . But if I didn't say it , well I'd still have felt it . Where's the sense in that ? I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder or return to where we were ... But I will go down with this ship . And I won't put up my hands up and surrender . There will be no white flag above my door . I'm in love , and always .. will be . 
GameStop is my church . 
I sit alone and watch the clock , tryin ' to collect my thoughts , and all I think about is .. you . If you belieeeeve in me , life's not always what it seems . Belieeeeeve in me , cuz I was made for chasing dreams ... 
>.< He better not fucking die 
Well , Dad's in the hospital . They're doing X-Rays and Cat Scans on him and he's staying over-night . ._. 
They finished Dad's surgery and he's okay , he's in the recovery room . As soon as they opened him up he bled and bled and bled because of his fucked liver . ._. But they got the bleeding under control and completed the surgery ... And he has sworn he'll never drink or smoke again . xD I dunno if I believe that or not . We'll see . 
Dad still recovering from the surgery and stuff . I haven't had a < PROPMALE > to visit yet and pretend to be 18 to get in , but if he's not out by tomorrow I'ma need to go visit . xD They have him on a ... breathalizer ?... Thing ? Cuz he was having trouble breathing I think . ._. My poor daddy .

He just royally PISSES me off . He got up in the middle of the night and undid all the stuff attached to him and left his room to find a beer .

First you wanna be free , now you say you need me , giving mixed signals and signs ... It's so hard to let you in , thinking you might slam the brakes again ! Put the pedal down , headin ' out of town , gotta make a getaway . The traffic in my brain's driving me insane , this is more than I can take ! You tell that you love me first , then throw your heart into reverse , I gotta getaway !

* Hides in my room * He needs to do overtime and stay at work longer . 
It is a military tradition that true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These friends pickup just like they spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far apart they live . REPOST this if you are lucky enough to have at least one friend like this . 
My dad is actually sober today . :O On a WEEKEND . Oh my God . It's a miracle . Freaking miracle . \ 
I bet he makes up for it tomorrow . 
As I thought , today he's making up for being sober .. for part of yesterday . This morning I got up at 9 and he was passed out in the computer chair . * Rolls eyes * 
If there is anyone out there that loves me ... they should like , make a peach cobbler and share with me . * Cravings * 
Just got home from watching Vampires Suck with cousins . :D This was the best night I've had in a while . xD You're awesome guys . * Thumbs up * Movie was hilarious , almost constant laughing . XD

SOMEBODY SATISFY MY CRAVINGSSSSS 
Good morning world . Up at 6:30 sharp and waiting for the day to roll on so I can say \It's time to get out of bed . \"" 
Okay , I hate needlepoint . Instead of the nice cross-stitch map of where everything is supposed to be like my wolf cross-stitch , the needlepoint came with a map that looks like paint-by-number . And the picture is inked onto the thing I'm supposed to be using thread on . Sounds easy enough , right ? I thought so too . But no . Effer . 
Worked on the truck with Dad . :D Was fun . Took two tires off the front and put new ones on , and put a tire on the back . I put one on all by myself with Dad gone for the first half of the operation . ^^ 
Scary dream last night X.x 
Going to A . J . ' s in a few . :D And Busch Gardens tomorrow . X3 YAY 
Hehe , I like A . J . ' s laptop . xD 
Ow >.< 
My bed . Smells like beer . Thanks , Dad . 
I need comfort food . Key Lime Pie in the freezer ... I'm going for it . 
< PROPFIRST > was put down last Saturday at the ripe old age of 14 . Poor Aidan is lonely , comes and lays on my floor in the day and hangs out with Mom and Dad at night . 
The past keeps chasing me when all I wanna do is forget about it . 
When I showed up and he was there , I tried my best to grin in there , and took the stairs but didn't stop at the street , and as we speak , I'm going down . ' Cause she spread her love , and burned me up . I can't let go , I can't get out ~ 
He's there in the dark , he's there in my heart\ 
He waits in the wings , he's gotta play a part\ 
Trouble is a friend , yeah trouble is a friend of mine\ 
Oh oh ~ 
Uuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhgggggggggggggggggggggggggggg 
My mouse has decided to be mean to me . ._. Sometimes when I click it double-clicks , or it won't click at all , and the scroll doesn't work anymore . Bastard 
I found what I wanna dress up in for Halloween but people keep laughing at me D= 
You know , Mom , maybe if you didn't nap a couple times a day , you'd actually sleep at night and be rested for the work day . 
Under your spell again ... \ 
I can't say no to you . \ 
Crave my heart .. and it's bleeding in your hand . \ 
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly ... \ 
Now I can't let go of this dream . \ 
I can't breathe but I feel ... \ 
Good enough , \ 
I feel good enough for you . 
Just got done trying to make fleas extinct in my room . X.x Tiring work . 
Supposed to be doing brakes on the truck tomorrow with Dad . I told him he better be sober for it , and he agreed , and I told him he better not be lying about it again like all the other times . 
Do you rent or own ? \ 
Own what ? \ 
Those wings , you angel . 
I love blasting music loud enough I can hear it no matter where I am in the house . 
I wanna lock you up in my closet ... \ 
When no one's around . \ 
I wanna push your hand in my pocket ... \ 
Because you're allowed . \ 
I wanna drive you into the corner ... \ 
And kiss you without a sound . \ 
I wanna stay this way forever ... \ 
I'll it loud ! \ 
Now you're in , you can't get out . 
I've decided to put Dreamer through Dressage training , instead of just working him and stuff . So , I got me some books and I'm reading up on it , maybe I'll get some help from < PROPFEMALE > , miss dressage < PROPFEMALE > . Lol 
Dad's been home since 4:30 , and has been playing Sudoku the whole time . Meanwhile , I'm sitting here waiting for him to be done so we can work on that truck . Who knows how much time we have with him actually being sober enough to do it ? 
Got the brake pads on the back tires of the truck , gonna work on front brakes tomorrow . \ 
Poor Mom is sick . I think she has a cold 
I like it on the table . o.o 
Went to my shoooow today , participated in Halter class and Open English Pleasure . Got last place in both . xD But I'm not upset about that . For once . It was fun\ 
Probably would have been funner though if I wasn't being attacked by sickness xP 
Crack the shutters , open wide , I wanna bathe you in the light of day\ 
And just watch you as the rays tangle up around your face and body\ 
I could sit for hours finding new ways to be awed each minute\ 
' Cause the daylight seems to want you just as much as I want you ~ 
Just watched < PROPMALE > of Persia . It was good <3 
Still fighting my demons , but don't worry ; I'll win .

Uhg . People at Taco < PROPFEMALE > are so disorganized . I wasn't on the schedule at all when I checked it Wednesday , and they haven't updated it . I was going to go see A.J. this weekend if I didn't have to work . But I called this morning and the manager won't be in until tomorrow morning so I have to call tomorrow morning . Uhg . If I don't have to work this weekend and I stayed home for nothing , I'ma be pissed . 
Don't follow in another's footsteps ; make your own path . 
Wishes she didn't have such a piece of shit boss . 
I fear that my wisdom teeth might be coming in . Oh .. please A . J .... Don't take your revenge on me with a video camera ._. 
Hey , all you hick chicks , < PROPFEMALE > divas , and you southern bells . All you redneck women , let me hear you yell .

Went to the DMV this morning and took my road test . Got my temporary license , whewt ! 
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger\ 
And finally drank away her memory\ 
Life is short but this time it was bigger\ 
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees\ 
We found him with his face down in the pillow\ 
With a note that said I'll love her till I die\ 
And when we buried him beneath the willow\ 
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby 
Two years and I love you more every day\ 
~ I love you ~ 
Yup , it's already started . Mom wants me to be her errand girl ~ \ 
Asked me to take the board check to the barn for her . Lol 
Redbull 
I expect French toast and sausage when I get up in the morning . Someone make me breakfast 
Thank you , Auntie , for bringing me breakfast . Not exactly what I wanted , but it was nummy nonetheless ! ^^ 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mom wants to change us to dial-up !!!!!!!! 
Work was lots better today ... I perfected a few more buttons and I'm getting yelled at for new things . Progress ? 
My 12-hole straw-fired Alto C Ocarina is at a reduced price on Amazon.com . :D Thinking of a Christmas present to myself . 
Didn't feel good last night and not any better today . Guess I should probably eat something before work though ... 
Uhg . Feel too sick to eat anything and I have work in an hour . 
Goin ' to the barn tomorrow morning , yaaaay ... Stall cleaning day , I suppose . \ 
My foot hurts !! 
If I die , I love you guys . 
Sigh ... I guess no more food for < PROPFIRST > . It doesn't wanna stay down . 
Feeling a little better this morning . Trying some cereal without the milk . Do not trust the milk when I'm sick . Besides that , we have none . Lol 
I hate when you get to the bottom of your drink and want that last bit but don't want to make the loud annoying sound with your straw . 
Holy crap . This is an old movie for sure . Watching my VHS of < PROPFIRST > Temple : Heidi\ 
Wow . Lol 
If you could control your dreams , what would you dream about ? 
Uhg . I'm not on the schedule at work agaaaain . =.= I'ma have to hurt someone . 
O_O Just got a nosebleed . Omg . That was scary . It just POURED out of my face 
is angry at the world in general 
And my weakness is that I care too much . And our scars remind us that the past is real 
Off to bed , and barn when I wake up . 
Woke up late X.x Oops 
I get to go see A.J. next weekend =D 
I wanna go to Ireland so bad . 
My wisdom teeth are beginning to come in . I feel like a baby teething , this tooth in the back is just beneath the gums and it hurts . XD 
Sigh . I have realized that I am VERY picky about the sound of my Christmas songs , and I can't find the version of Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing that I like . Uhg ... Gonna look through some old cassets tomorrow and see if I can find it . 
IT'S SNOWINGGGGG !!!!!!!! 
I love how my mom still texts my ex . 
Wow my hair is really soft . <3 
Well I'm gonna take the high road\ 
And do what the preacher told me to do\ 
You keep messing up , \ 
And I'll keep praying for you . \ 
I pray your tire blows out , \ 
At 110 . \ 
I pray you pass out drunk , \ 
With your best friend , \ 
And wake up with His&Her tattoos . \ 
I pray your brakes go out , \ 
Running down a hill . \ 
I pray a flowerpot falls from a windowsill , \ 
And knocks you in the head\ 
Like I'd like to . 
I have found the down-side to getting your license and driving alone . \ 
There's no one to punch when you see a bug . 
I miss my Dreamer . Will have to go see him on Christmas and bring him something nice 
Good night . 
* Laughs at A.J. as she dies every time trying to kill Larxene in KH RE : Chain of Memories * C =

PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this 
Mom hasn't been home all days , and I been up since 9 . =S School bus gone with her . Where is yoo ? 
Back when a hoe was a hoe\ 
Coke was a coke\ 
And crack's what you were doing\ 
When you were cracking jokes\ 
Back when a screw was a screw\ 
The wind was all that blew\ 
And when you said I'm down with that\ 
Well it meant you had the flu\ 
I miss back when 
Symptoms of asthma can be treated with a roller coaster ride . 
Goin ' to the barn today , Dreamer needs his blanket on . Think I'll ride him some while I'm there , and need to do stalls . 
Only just now realize that when I move out I probably won't be able to keep Dreamer . 
Good morning y'all

I hate when it snows , because I don't want to make the first footprint in the perfectly untouched layer of snow . 
Why does tomorrow's nice temperature have to be ruined by thunderstorms in the morning and wind/clouds in the afternoon ? Uhg . 
<3 Grilled cheeses are amazing . 
52 thoroughbred horses need homes . Will go to Sugarcreek this Saturday for slaughter . Gentleman died and his son wants nothing to do with them . Most broodmares are broke and some are in foal weanling , yearlings , 2 yrs and 3 yrs old .. most are gelded . FREE and papered . Friend of the deceased is trying to find homes 440-463-4288 or 440-463-4288 Barnesville , OH . Please copy and paste this on your status ! 
Today is the day to be opening windows . Nice day right at the beginning of February ? Wow . Lol 
Wouldn't almost dying make you wanna be a better person for the people around you ? I guess not . 
Ahhhhh , double fake-out on I Shouldn't Be Alive tonight . Guess they're wising up and learning how to properly keep us in suspense ! 
Regarding the thoroughbred horses , word is that they all have homes & are requesting no further calls to that # ... most were apparently taken by family members pretty quickly . \

Oh nooo , no snow ~ ~ 
I'm 17 =D 
Love is . It just is and nothing you can say can make it go away because it is the point of why we are here , it is the highest point and once you are up there , looking down on everyone else , you're there forever . Because if you move , right , you fall . You fall . 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes . :D 
Just discovered Kramer Tire does on the job training , sounds good to me . :D

You always know what to say\ 
To make me feel like everything's okay ...
