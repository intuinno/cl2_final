okay , okay , i made a facebook for people i don't go to school with . =p 

finishing my last final projects today . soooo ready to be done with them . bring on spring break . 
wooo ! just got the call from From First to Last and Asking < PROPFEMALE > to tour manage in May . i think i may end up just doing this for a living . 
going home to visit for a day or two this weekend before i begin a marvelous spring break of parties and what not . 
getting free merch this week . ^___^ being a designer has perksss . YESSS . 
monster hitman shots in the evening : worst idea i've EVER had . i'm never going to get to sleep . =[ 
i rediscovered < PROPFIRST > dayne and all that other eighties stuff my mom played in the car when i was a toddler . nowwww i know why my relationships are so screwed up and scandalous . XP 
don't know why i'm so excited that he's coming back to san < PROPMALE > , no wait , i do . i'm in all kinds of denial sometimes . 
just had lunch with < PROPMALE > , going to the movies with < PROPFEMALE > in a bit , then coming back to chill and spend the night at my grandparents ' . figured out my plans for the rest of break and the week after . i feel so on top of things . XD 
i've got like , a seat , maybe two for POP in May , if anyone's going . we're getting a hotel and doing it up right that weekend . XP so if anyone wants to go , hit me up . =] 
lawlz sitting on skype with < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > in the middle of an interview , trying to stay quiet while i laugh at their answers . XD 
barbecuing and waiting for all the other people to show up . just watched the < PROPMALE>'s inferno movie ( was hilarious ) . probably going to put on the dead space prequel now while we eat . XD 
beach again tomorrowwww . i may be getting a tan this summer . XP 
may be looking at houses with friends next week . funfunfun . 
i'm going to the beach . good < PROPMALE > i might melt , but oh well . =p 
messiah says RAWWER . 
i hate college frat guys that try to make you feel guilty for not wanting to go < PROPFEMALE > out with them or date them , etc . if only they realized i'm not exactly capable of the \caring\ " emotion . psychopathic tendencies are so wonderful when dealing with sociopathic suiters . " 
i believe i'm going to take myself out to a movie tonight . i'll even pay and by myself a soda . how nice . 
i think it's hilarious that in high school i was called names and whatever for wearing black and listening to metal bands that i now work for , and all of those kids that gave me crap are now fans of those same bands . i <3 < PROPFEMALE > . thanks facebook for letting me know how it all turned out . 
mmm english phone calls at midnight . =} 
off to dream about eyebrows and caterpillars , cats and merry-go-rounds , hard-boiled eggs , and fighting through the apocalypse to reach the devil . 
yeah , i don't care if you're a cop , riding someone's tail in heavy traffic when they can't get over and nearly running me off the road is ridiculous . i'm seriously tempted to call the escondido police for that ridiculousness . i HATE cops these days . they don't protect us at all and they force us into illegal driving maneuvers . >=| 
anyone want to chill tomorrow ? i'm in north county for another day before i head back to downtown . 
it's so weird that someone can make a child , be there for a couple years , and then walk away without ever looking back . i wonder if he ever thinks about me .. ={ 
on the bright side , i'm now a registered republican and can't wait to get < PROPMALE > out of office . XD 
only four more days now . =] ahhhhh , i can't wait . ^__^ 
it's amazing how much therapeutical value can be found in the purchase of a great pair of shoes . 
busting out grenadine and mixing up some < PROPFIRST > temples . XD i feel eight . 
never go full cowboy . 
ack i can't stand it when venues don't have internet . ={ 
only three more days now . ^__^ 
ugh ! sephora ! stop emailing me when i'm waiting for an important one ! >_< 
i reeeeally wish all my friends weren't turning into < PROPFEMALE > kids . >_< i hate being the only one with braincells in a room full of e-tards . 
soooo . looks like i get to be in a shoot for killbrand's new ad . hahaha . oh jeez . 
i really can't stand it when people with poor grammar have internet access . 
tri-city friends , we should have been partying like that all along . sleep nowww . 
i can't believe coast to coast am is changing over to a radio cooking show . where else will i get my conspiracy theory fix now ? =,[ 
gahh , i hope he made it . >.< i hate not knowing if everything's alright . 
does no one celebrate easter anymore ? =/ seems like all of my friends are using today as another party day . it's disheartening that their faith was left behind , along with the memories of their high school years . 
holy rolling earthquakes , batman . i'd really appreciate it if they could fix the elevators in my building now . several flights of stairs with all of my luggage destroyed me . 
yayyyy , he gets here tonight . =] i'm so happy . ^___^ 
ahhhhhhh , ten more hours . XD i'm pop into confetti any second . 
listening to him write songs . i love my life . ^__^ 
playing < PROPMALE>'s inferno with < PROPMALE > , kicking hell's butt . 
just got tour in may sorted . =] going to be with from first to last , asking < PROPFEMALE > , & we came as romans . ^_^ gonna be so exciting . 
ooooooooooh , last night . los < PROPFEMALE > , you blow my mind sometimes . 
night to myself . laundry , diet coke , and my packaging project . =] 
the fabreeze commercial's whistling makes < PROPMALE > start tweeting and bouncing around his cage . ^_^ it's adorable . 
ughh , i hate being in the middle of things . > < 
it's hilarious how people don't realize that when they still aren't added as your friend , it MUST be because it's a facebook error . it just COULDN'T be that i just ignored your request . noooo . ( capslock importance ) XD 
las vegas , i hate you . 
he's on a plane to germany and i'm pretty upset . =[ anyways , i've got a month to kill before tour . 
mmmmm , i wish someone could come stay with me for a couple of days just to get me back into the swing of things . =[ 
wooo album artwork job ! 
congratulations me , you just may have ruined everything . woooo ! 
lol , i love australians . 
GUESS WHO HAS XBOX LIVE AGAINNNNNN !!!!!!! 
GIMME YOUR GAMERTAGS ! 
don't understand why i'm so easily made a fool of .. too afraid to sleep and dream about the reality of this situation . 
i feel so horrible . even his parents don't want me to break everything off with him . 
met someone pretty great . =] 
mmm , handling this with grace to his face is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do . OH WELL . i convinced all the hot topics in downtown to move his band's products to the back of the store and remove their cd from their playlist . that's what you get for cheating , you jerk . 
yesssss . there ARE still decent tattooed guys on this planet , and in california . XD 
my fingers are bleeding from cutting out my packaging project . i'm so exhausted by these midterm assignments . -___- 
< PROPFEMALE > sigh , date tomorrow . ^.^ 
it's so annoying to break things off and expect them to be over and then get email after email of reasons why he loves me , despite his stupidity . =p 
guestlisting with from first to last and AA this week . 
heading up to LA tomorrow to chill with the guys , show and then going to the sumerian label party . XD gotta pick my outfit . ^__^ 
so much craziness last night . ran around hollywood with < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > , went to the AA and FFTL show , < PROPMALE > screwed up his ankle , took him to the emergency room , sumerian afterparty and then ridiculous amounts of drama afterward . but oh well , guestlist on friday as well . bring on more i-love-you-i-dont-wan t-t o-love-anyone-else drama . XP 
going to be on the asking < PROPFEMALE > dvd . pulled on camera last night and had < PROPMALE > announce that several of the songs on the current album were about me and the next album is mostly all about me as well . so ready to take a bath and chill out before going back tomorrow and dealing with more ridiculousness . 
lol , best night tonight . =] chilling with all the guys and figuring out future plans . achieved my 14 year old dream of getting < PROPMALE > good's phone number . ahaha . ^__^ 
it's nights like these that i feel like my life is boring because i opt to stay home . THEN , i think about it and i feel silly . i'm going to miss these nights alone once i graduate . =] 
< PROPMALE > out with AA and FFTL one last night . found out something tragic , i honestly feel like an < PROPFEMALE > has ended because of it . we came as romans was actually super chill . tried to learn how to gamble with them , so confusing . >.< ended up working merch counter and sound a few hundred dollars worth of stuff in under 20min , and made $45 in tips . XD such a fun , weird , eventful night . 
lol , i love how i still get all excited and squeal like i'm 14 when < PROPMALE > texts me . i'm such a loser . XD 
ughhh , i hate knowing secrets . WHY do they trust me with secrets ?? > < 
lol , you can't get rid of english people . even when you tell them to go away . they just keep showing up . 
getting my main final project turned in for the quarter . epicentre tonight with < PROPMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > out with watchout ! there's ghosts . going to atticus factory to pick out some shirts and mingle . =]

gwahhh , i need the rest of my photos from mayhem . >.< winds of plague , chimaira , in this moment and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > were amazinggg . zombie completely blew my mind and probably singed my eyebrows sitting next to the pyrotechnics . atreyu was HORRIBLE though . js . sunburnt though , ick !

no matter how good of a friend he is with my ex , my big brother gives the most reassuring and honest advice . keeps me on the right track toward all of this getting better and staying positive . 
busy new year . designing a line of shirts for With Oceans Below . possibly touring with the motionless guys again this march and really tempted to leak my ex's unreleased music along with their new cd for my womanly revenge , but eh .. just considering it .

in bed , waiting for the family to get back . taking pictures of moo and her new haircut . =p 
hanging out with < PROPFIRST > his last night before tour . black ops . ^_^ 
nothing like sitting up behind lars ' drum set while they play and watching kids punch each other and headbang with hair only as long as their moms would let them grow it . threw all the yellow and orange skittles at the front row . 
Helium walks into a bar . The bartender goes , \We don't serve < PROPMALE > gases . \ " The helium doesn't react . " 
brushing Moo and filing her nails . pretty puppy night .

bring on it on , st < PROPFEMALE>'s . 
i wish i could be the photoshop police to some of you 18 and under girls . you're not fooling anyone with your blurry , enlarged chests . gaussian blur of imperfect skin is a forgivable cyber-sin , but please don't touch the liquify filter until you're at least legally able to attract attention there . 
second final done . now i have a cold , so i'm off to go home and bomb my insides with vitamin C and ice water . only nine more months until i have my bachelor's degree . 
considering a move to Seattle by the next year . 
nothing like receiving an email from your ex that he's overdosed and gotten alcohol poisoning all live on stage in front of underaged fans and that he thinks he's going to die . the world only has room for one < PROPFIRST > sheen , my dear . i have no time for attention-seeking behavior . 
saw gone with the wind for the first time . cryingggg . ahhhhhhhhhh ! 
just received an invite to < PROPFIRST > kimmel live on the 11th . debating going . 
< PROPMALE > just emailed me the lyrics to \to the stage\ " . i don't know how i feel right now . " 
i really can't stand being tied down anymore . decisions decisions . hmmm .
