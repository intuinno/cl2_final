The heart wants to love , yet we hate . The heart wants to understand , yet we are confused . The heart wants equality , yet we try to dominate one another . The heart wants peace , yet we fight . The heart wants to give , yet we are greedy . The heart wants to help , yet we destroy . The heart wants to care , yet we are insensitive . If only the heart were a little stronger ...
