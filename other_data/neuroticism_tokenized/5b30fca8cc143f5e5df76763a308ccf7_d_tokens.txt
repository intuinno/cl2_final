is back at Yale 

Anyone up for seeing 9 this weekend ? 
is listening to all of the little kids playing outside his window and wondering if they will let him join in . 
Happy < PROPMALE > Erikson Day ! 
thinks the new Saybrook cat is way nicer than the old one ; sorry Rainbow . 
wishes he had someone with whom to talk excitedly about poetry right now . 
Proverbs 3:5 -6 
has given himself an extension on his paper so he can enjoy the weekend . 
Showdown in the Saybrook Library : Who will be the last man left studying ? 
Apparently impromptu jam sessions do not facilitate paper writing . 
My fortune cookie from tonight's study break : \Don't panic . \"" 
is back in Siler City . 
Just called the neighbors to let them know they have some cows out . 
I'll not listen to reason ... reason always means what someone else has got to say . 
I got a care package from home , which raises the question : how many cookies can < PROPFIRST > eat in one day ? If you answered all of them , you're right ! 
' s mind is on a humid summer night , the racket of cicadas and bullfrogs , and an old creaking porch swing . 
My Spanish isn't good enough to write an email to my Spanish professor explaining that I'm dropping her class — oh , the irony . 
\Me fail English ? That's unpossible . \"" 
I had a nightmare last night that I had been working on the wrong paper , and it was actually another that was due tomorrow . Pretty sad right ? Whatever happened to nightmares about monsters or missing an easy pop-fly in the outfield or accidental public nudity ? * Sigh * I guess times have changed . 
If I turn on all of the lights in my room it makes it seem like it's daytime and I don't feel so tired , perhaps . 
I'm loving this heat and humidity , it reminds me of home . In just one more week I'll be back in NC ! 
Ahh ! This paper is moving at such a snail's pace . Why is the last one of the year always the hardest ? My focus has already gone on summer break . 
can't sleep can't sleep can't sleep can't sleep 
New cycling personal best today : A total of 4 bumble-bees flew into my face(one directly into my eye ; I guess that's why you're supposed to wear sunglasses ... ) 
Hey I'm 21 . Thanks for the happy birthday wishes friends ! 
... back home from a week in Annapolis yesterday , and tomorrow I'll be heading to back to Connecticut . 
... back home from a week in Annapolis yesterday , and tomorrow I'll be heading back to Connecticut . 
had a successful first day of work in Stamford . 
is cleaning spilled oil off of the walruses native to the Gulf of Mexico . 
I wish I was outside ... or at least that I had a window in my office ... 
USA wins ! < PROPMALE > is amazing ! 
going to New Haven tomorrow . If there are any summer New Havenites around who want to have lunch Friday afternoon let me know ... 
[ death by monkeys ] 
A vase of orange and purple flowers makes my office a much happier place . 
Friday ... 
speeding + wet roads + no anti-lock breaks = brilliant idea 
I'm the only one that showed up for work this morning ... I think I missed a memo . 
Last week of interning 
Everyone is out of the office today . I might have to take a 2 hour lunch break ... at least 2 hours ... 
My thank-you letters and gifts are written and bought for my boss and host family , just one long day of work stands between me and relaxing back home in NC . 
is trying to remember how to do math . Just when I thought I'd never have to use that side of my brain again , I have to study for the GRE ... 
is in search of the perfect outdoors reading spot for a < PROPFEMALE > day . 
already contemplating whether or not to drop a class ... 
My mom sending me instant grits through the mail makes for a very happy day . 
Thunderstorm ! 
I'm glad this crazy week's over and it's finally Friday . With all the rushing around I've felt like I was the rabbit in < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland , except I wasn't as nicely dressed . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and I , together all night long . 
And suppose that you lived/ \ 
In that < PROPMALE > in < PROPFEMALE > / \ 
Where the average young person/ \ 
Just hasn't a < PROPMALE > / \ 
To escape from the perilous/ \ 
Pants eating plants ! 
\Time happens to people . \ " (?)" 
Why is there no heat in Saybrook ? 
my mom sending me Sleepytime Tea makes me very happy . 
I just realized I don't have even one article of clothing with a Yale logo on it for the game tomorrow ... 
Back home in NC . 
I'm debating whether or not to go to class office hours . I estimate : 30% of having to wait in line for more than an hour , 50% < PROPMALE > of the meeting being helpful , 100% < PROPMALE > of receiving dissaproving oblique criticism of not working hard enough ... 
Write , write , write ... 
I got a paper extension today and almost cried ... well , not really . But it does make life a lot happier . 
Snow ? 
Hello , my name is < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and I live in the library . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! I hope it's a special day for you , no matter where you are . 
It's snowing in North < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I have electricity and internet again ! 
I love/hate when books express exactly what I feel ... It's nice to have the words , but upsetting that they aren't mine . Time to get writing . 
Back in New Haven ! To start my last semester at Yale ... 
Someone needs to refill the Saybrook vending machine . If I have to eat one more bag of Dipsy Doodles I'm going to lose it . 
I really wish I knew how to do math ... 
I can't believe no one has nominated me for 50 most beautiful people yet . 
Allnighterallnighterallnighterallnighter ... 
Does anyone have ski pants I can borrow for tomorrow ? Please ? 
sick .... but at least I'm finally getting some sleep . 
excited for spring break yeah ! 
So many to do lists lately , so much to do ... 
To everyone I owe an email/phone call/meal : I'll get my life together tomorrow , I promise . 
Singing < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > with Sello Lekalakala . \Ain't it good to know you've got a friend ? \"" 
New society , Bulb and Spade , amazing , http://ow.ly/4J7GS
