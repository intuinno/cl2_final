looking for a problem to solve has to be a real world issue and can't change people . open to creating any tech needed feel free to ask .

decided to throw my ideas for a better world out into the world and see if anyone out there agrees or at least has a descent argument . 
happy belated birthday < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
ever wonder if life is a virus from another universe ? it can't be messured or replaced once it leaves the matter it's adapted to serve it . it seams to have only one imperitive to spread . this planet may simply be a beach head of the invasion carrying the plague beyond to the stars . \ 
I say let it be we shall claim this universe in the name of brittania for you have no flag . 
happy singles awareness day 
glad it's warm and I have some money now I can get \\back to work on my vw < PROPFIRST > restoration . just gota get the alternator hooked up and started . 
sleepless and tired never a good combo . time to eat some steak and potatoes then try to squeeze in an hour or so of sleep . \ 
wish the brain had an off switch . 
off to work on my friday then sleep like the dead for a day . 
loving the heat got outside did some work around the house going for a walk later 93 degrees so vary nice . \ 
I can feel my skin waking up again . 
200 foot of fence up now have to build a new coop and then I'll be ready for my chicks to run free . maybe more , more work and more animals . 
ever have one of those days when you finaly slow down and realize your soul is tired and it went to sleep long before you ? \ 
yep that kinda day . 
some times when the hours get long at work it gets hard to hold the crazy in and I have to say I'm not responsible for some of it spilling out
