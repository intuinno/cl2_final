true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what name\ 
brand you wear , if your house is a mess , where you live , about your\ 
past , or if your family is filled with crazies , they love you for who\ 
you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking , \ 
but ... never questions the friendship . Re ... post if you have at least one true friend , they will know who they are .
