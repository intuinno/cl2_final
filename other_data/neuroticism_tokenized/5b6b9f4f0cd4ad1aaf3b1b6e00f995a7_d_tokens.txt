The < PROPFEMALE > does not take to hoarding . The more he lives for others , the fuller is his life . The more he gives , the more the abounds . The Way of Heaven is to benefit and , not to harm . The way of the < PROPFEMALE > is to do his duty , not to strive with anyone . -- tao teh < PROPFEMALE > 81 
standardized testing is extremely pointless . 
give yourself mind and body , but save your spirit , for it is yours for eternity .

Torrie’s self-proclaimed rules of Facebook . If you break these , you probably belong on myspace . \ 
Rule number 1 : Your name must be your actual legal name ; no peace signs or hears and not your “future husband/wife’s” last name . 
Torrie’s self-proclaimed rules of Facebook . If you break these , you probably belong on myspace . \ 
Rule number 2 : This is not twitter , do not post your every thought here . Examples include , but are not limited to , the following . “I love * insert subject’s name here*” or “I'm going to * insert subject’s hometown here*” 
Rule # 3 : No statuses less than five words , unless they are important or entertaining . Examples of bad statuses : “home , watching * insert tv show/movie*” or “Can’t wait until * insert day*” ( Note : further explanation needed ) \ 
Examples of good statuses : “burring a corps” or “taking a shit” 
Rule # 4 : As proposed by Ivan : Statuses are not to be used to express your emotions . Whether you miss your boyfriend or you just caught your girl in bed with < PROPFIRST > from work , we don’t need to hear about it . 
Torrie’s self-proclaimed rules of Facebook . \ 
Rule # 5 : I will now turn my attention towards pictures , more importantly , picture ratios . If the pictures you’ve put on here are more than 70% of you , by yourself , you need to remove a few . I will leave higher percentiles and necessary actions to be decided by the people . Note : this rule ONLY comes into effect if you have more than 35 pictures on your account . 
Rule # 6 : If you have an album titled “Me” delete it right now . How lazy do you have to be not to write more of a description than “Me” ? More importantly this album probably breaks rule number five because it contains pictures that you have taken of yourself from some crappy < PROPFEMALE > or with the help of a bathroom mirror . Gawd forbid you learn how to use the time delay on your camera . 
So i am thinking of making a real < PROPFEMALE > for < PROPMALE > Griffin . Does anyone think he would mind me \officially representing\ " him ? " 
Rule #7 : Unacceptable picture gestures : All of the following could have their own individual rule , but in an effort to save time , they will be grouped here . Keep your tongue in your mouth . No writing on your body . No crotch-shots or arched backs , and no more than 25% of your breasts should be exposed at any time . Finally , no more than 5% of your pics should have you throwing up any kind of sign .
