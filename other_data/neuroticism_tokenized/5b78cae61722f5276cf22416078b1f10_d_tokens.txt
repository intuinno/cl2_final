Love is a constant battle between the heart and the mind ; True Love is when they agree . \ 
True love is not finding someone else but finding your other half . \ 
True love is not how you forgive , but how you forget , not what you see\ 
but what you feel , not how you listen but how you understand , and not\ 
how you let go but how you hold on .

Life\ 
as we find it , is too hard for us : it brings us too many pains , \ 
disappointments and impossible tasks . In order to bear it , we cannot\ 
dispense with palliative measures There are three such measures :\ 
powerful deflections , which cause us to make light of our misery ;\ 
substitute satisfactions , which diminish it ; and intoxicating\ 
substances which make us insensitive to it . \ 
~ Sigmund Freud quotes 
A consistent thinker is a thoughtless person , because he conforms to a pattern ; he repeats phrases and thinks in a groove . \

“The\

A\ 
compassionate attitude opens our inner door , and as a result it is much\ 
easier to communicate with others . If there is too much self-centered \ 
attitude , then fear , doubt and suspicion come and as a result our inner \ 
door closes . Then it is very difficult to communicate with others .

“It\ 
is wrong to think that misfortunes come from the east or from the west ;\ 
they originate within one's own mind . Therefore , it is foolish \ 
to guard against misfortunes from the external world and leave the inner\ 
mind uncontrolled . ”\ 
foolish man seeks happiness in the distance ; the wise grows it \ 
under his feet . ”\ 
“If\ 
a million people say a foolish thing , it is still a foolish\ 
thing . ” 
If you keep telling me right all the while doing left , I'm going to think you a liar . Match your actions with your words . Don't say what sounds good , say what is , regardless of the response you might get .

All our philosophy is dry as dust if it \

Would like to say sorry to all those who aren't having as GREAT a day as I'am . Think positive and behave in a way that conveys your thoughts ( positive thinking ) and your be fine . Good luck , and I hope tomorrow is your turn to have a GREAT day . 
My true religion , my simple faith is in love and compassion . There is \ 
no need for complicated philosophy , doctrine , or dogma . Our own heart , \ 
our own mind , is the < PROPFEMALE > . The doctrine is compassion . Love for others\ 
and respect for their rights and dignity , no matter who or what they \ 
are - these are ultimately all we need . 
To familiarize ourselves with the virtue of < PROPFEMALE > , it is very helpful to think of adversity not so much as a threat to our peace of mind but rather as the very means by which < PROPFEMALE > is attained . From this perspective , we see that those who would harm us are , in a sense , teachers of < PROPFEMALE > . Such people teach us what we could never learn merely from hearing someone speak , be they ever so wise or holy . 
“Your time is limited , so don't waste it living someone else's life . Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking . Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart ... and intuition . They somehow already know what you truly want to become . Everything else is secondary . ”

Listen to the mustn'ts , child , Listen to the don'ts - \

We\ 
can think of honesty and dishonesty in terms of relationships \ 
between appearance and reality . Sometimes they synchronize , often they \ 
do not ; but when they do , that is honesty , as I understand it . So we are\ 
honest when our actions are what they seem to be . When we pretend to be\ 
one thing but in reality we are something else , suspicion develops in \ 
others , causing fear . And fear is something we all wish to avoid .

is manufactured in plants . \

Please\ 
put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone , \ 
who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2011 is that people will \ 
understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed \ 
of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't \ 
copy and paste this as they have ... already ... been ... eaten by a dragon . 
Theoretically , \ 
one could imagine a situation where armed intervention at an early \ 
stage might prevent large-scale conflict . The problem is that it is very\ 
difficult , if not impossible , to predict the outcome of violence . That \ 
it will be just is not guaranteed at the outset – it will only become \ 
clear in hindsight . The only certainty is that where there is violence , \ 
there is always and inevitably suffering .

“We\

If I do not change when circumstances demand it , how can I expect others to . 
Material\ 
progress and a higher standard of living bring us greater comfort and \ 
health , but do not lead to a transformation of the mind , which is the \ 
only thing capable of providing lasting peace . Profound happiness , \ 
unlike fleeting pleasures , is spiritual in nature . It depends on the \ 
happiness of others and it is based on love and affection .
