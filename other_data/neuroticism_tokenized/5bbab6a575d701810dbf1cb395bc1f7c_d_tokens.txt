feels very fortunate to be surrounded by great people ! 
is ready to rock the Zip/Swing with Pandora streaming from the Crackberry . It really doesn't take much to make me all giddy inside 
anyone know how to suggest a friend to another friend ? 
Had a great day on the beach . Trained < PROPFEMALE > & Will how to attack seagulls ( aka Rats with wings ) , then ate at < PROPFEMALE > Darty's ( < PROPFEMALE > pub on beach ) . They didn't have a dress code , so Will & I ate without shirts . Now we're back @ the house for the kids nap time . After nap its off to Barefoot Landing , then possibly the pool @ the Condo . 
change of plans for the evening ... Olivia & Will just concluded a water hose war ... Olivia 1 Will 0 . Played another round of swords ... Will 6 Daddy 3 . A victory in our games of swords is awarded to the person who collapses to the ground feinting death first . Let me just say , Will is very quick in his death roll . Now we're cooking a pizza , then off to Barefoot Landing in NMB ( North < PROPFEMALE > Beach ) . 
VERIZON's cell coverage in the < PROPFEMALE > Beach area is horrendous ! Please don't try to call as it may not even go through ... facebook is the best method to stay in touch . I'm not frustrated or anything ... 
Kid quotes & conversations Debby : Will you look like you are sleepy . Will : I've got crack . I eat crack . ------------------------------------ While playing putt-putt we walked through a cave . There was a jail cell with bones located inside . < PROPFEMALE > stated upon this discovery \That's where they put < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s bones . All his muscle turned to dirt . \"" 
oh , and Will now has an imaginary friend named \Punkas . \"" 
while waiting for a thunderstorm to clear the area ... Olivia & I are watching Ni Hao ... and learning some Chinese 
Its off to \Naked Feet\ " landing ( aka Barefoot landing ) for some Father-Daughter time . According to < PROPFEMALE > \ " 5 year olds are only allowed to go on a date with their daddy . \ " The 1st video of our vacation should be available soon once it clears \ " processing . \"" 
had a fantastic afternoon with < PROPFIRST > Wimmers Talley & her son Elie . It was great to re-connect to re-connect with her after 15 years . We went to the Children's museum ( it featured education material , but was centered around dramatic play in themed rooms ) , had dinner at an Italian Pub ( no typo ) , then took a brief walk with the kids along the river , and got some Ice cream . look for more videos tonight- 
OK , I'm officially Noggin-d out ! I've got a Fresh feet/beat band song stuck in my head , Yo Gabba Gabba is becoming appealing , and the Miss Spider < PROPFEMALE > patch friend show is amusing . Its time for a < PROPFIRST > Statham movie marathon 
Escaped the madness of Noggin & went down to the beach . Built a minor sand fortification , < PROPFEMALE > & I went walking through the surf ( aka potholes ... the bottom is uneven ) , and concluded w/ snorkeling . 
just determined how to retrieve pics from the Blackberry using USB connection . Images shortly- 
just returned with < PROPFEMALE > from a walkabout in North < PROPFEMALE > Beach ... got some ice cream , shopped at the local beachwear bargain store , and took some pics w/the Crackberry . 
our last day @ the beach . 4 consideration today : More beach ( surprised ? ) , then Broadway @ the beach ... where I will walk on water in a giant bubble ala < PROPMALE > Coyne 
just got back from the Beach for the last time this trip . < PROPFEMALE > saw plenty of her favorite body part ( ie , masculine posterior ) and I saw plenty of mine . Our 30 minute quota's have been realized . Kids had a great time AND we finally built something that looks like a sand castle ! 
Off to Broadway @ the Beach 4 the traditional picture in the huge chair & walking water ball ! 
returned from Broadway @ the Beach 1 hour ago . Got to walk on water in the giant Ball .... a very cool experience . Think of it like walking on a very firm inflatable mattress . 
me oh my oh , we're on our way to o-HI-O !!! 
me oh my oh , we're back in OHIO ! A final wrap-up to our vacation including supporting documentation , bibliography , never-before-seen video , etc . when I wake up later today . Finally , shout out to God for watching over us , which enabled us to have a GREAT FAMILY VACATION !

is amazed that Ocho Cinco just kicked a field goal !!! 
hates assembling metal shelving . If I go to Hell , the devil will give me this job and doing dishes . 
had a great evening with the cousins watching ( and insulting ) WWE's Summer Slam . We also managed to scare away < PROPFEMALE>'s boyfriend ... which I blame solely on < PROPFIRST > Adams 
Today's agenda : retrieve & drop-off furniture , work online , meet-up w/ < PROPFIRST > 
ok , I need something to read ... something that will make my mind hurt ... Stephen Hawking ... done , < PROPFIRST > Hume , done , < PROPFIRST > Bohm ... done . Any suggestions ? Team Green : I need intellectual stimulation ! 
Dr. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is now issuing prescriptions to those with ailments . Please give her a pretend call at her pretend office if you have a REAL issue . just typing this verbatim moreorless ... and why exactly did we send her to public schools ... yeah , its my fault 
hopes tomorrow goes well & the adults don't become overly inebriated ... although drunk soap box derby racing cars could be amusing ! 
had a good day with a very fun group @ CCG . Now uploading images of the kids , etc . 
does NOT agree with using religion or God as a reason to discriminate 
just read some very interesting information about Jesus . One theory holds that he was buried in Kashmir ... as in that province Pakistan & < PROPFEMALE > are squabbling over-

if there is anything , just anything ... then we have something- 
HATES Windows Vista ( of hell ) WITH A PASSION !!! 
will get mass air & river time during the next 5 days = - 
thinks < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s command of satirical humor is a pleasantry all of mankind should experience AT LEAST once before they die .

Dear Microsoft , do the right thing for all of your customers stuck with Vista and send them Windows XP ( SP2 ) Premium edition . Otherwise , we become VERY loyal Apple customers . Signed , #1 VISTA H8TR

will pay & pay handsomly for staying up this late .... without cause or reason ... 
is reffereeing 3 5/6 year old girls ... oh what FUN !!! 
The 2008 Bengals would've folded and lost today . Resolve & toughness is the biggest difference over last year in my opinion- 
I suffer today to prosper tomorrow- 
was attacked by a 1\ thick Honeysuckle branch and the lower lip looks like a botox injection gone terribly wrong- " 
not sure where to begin about today ... which went VERY well . It all starts & ends with the fact we have 220 kids at camp right now . Thankfully this 33 year old can still out run the 12 year olds ! 
Amazing Race in the morning ... then afternoon clean-up . Next week is shaping up to be a Monday-Sunday marathon with a few OEE groups THEN Fall Fest ~ 
after sleeping 9.5 hours over the past 2 days ... this homo sapien sapien is ready for bed- 
The illness Day 5 : Will ( aka Danger Boy ) is back to full speed , < PROPFEMALE>'s fever is holding steady at 99 degrees : < PROPFEMALE > is feeling better ; and I ( aka carrier monkey ) managed to over-pressurize my right sinus cavity w/the Neidi pot . Now that was BEAST !!! 
Haiti is very complex on the surface , but the answer boils down to illiteracy & lack of education . The country doesn't need a mountain of money as there is a LENGTHY history of the bourgeoisie siphoning off funds for their own personal gain . I propose we donate a MOUNTAIN of school books to Haiti . Education & tenacity is the only way Haiti will break the long standing cycle ... or a communist revolution 
gave myself a hair cut last night ... after inadvertently giving myself a mullet- 
found the snow shovel , next up : the sled . So , where are the good spots arund Fairfield for sledding ? 
I've been waiting 3 years to build a snow fort with Will . Today was the day & it was fun ... until Will started the unyielding , tenacious snowball assault on my face . Will also assaulted the neighbor's dog , and attempted to assualt passing cars . He's going to be in juvenile hall before kindergarten ... 
made up my mind : going back to school to finish off this architecture degree- 
big changes next week : back to work @ CCG , Will starts pre-school , and the winter domestication session is over 
should I be glad my < PROPFIRST > money market made $ . 02 last month ... seriously , 2 pennies . Better than losing $ . 02 ?! 
lots of news to report : < PROPFEMALE > had heard first cavity removed last Monday with cavity #2 scheduled to be fixed Monday . Will IS POTTY TRAINED , although we're still using pull-ups on occasion . Also officially back to work @ CCG- 
fyi ... my Blackberry went through the washer , so please call < PROPFEMALE>'s phone if u need to get in touch- 
< PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > of wisdom of the day : be grateful for the gifts you receive . Don't become ungrateful for the gifts others receive .

The Crackberry Tales : Last week the Curve 8500 braved & survived the depths of the Miami River . This week , it endures the vile stomach bile of < PROPFEMALE > & survives ( after extreme sanitation ! ) What now ... other smart ... phone ... brands 
Today's Mother Day agenda : B-Fast in bed , Lifetime movies , Zoo , Sawyer Point , then dinner on the river ... meanwhile Dad watches the Cavs on the Crackberry ( in a nonchalant secret , manner ) 
the Cavaliers are playing like they bought tickets for a Disney cruise leaving Saturday night .

almost fell on the dining hall floor laughing at < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jokes ... I really need a motrin now- 
fighting flu bug + working = I'm beat !

Lost 10 pounds this weekend , and have already gained 5 back . but wait ... there's more : mid-week day off = sleeping in until 9:30 or so ! 
CHACO ( dis)Credit Union is a very mediocre company that provides bad/misleading information . Their customer Service hotline is a bad joke , some of their tellers blow smoke like a 6-alarm fire , and now we're receiving overdraft fees for mysterious reasons ( that they can't properly support with logic ) . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I believe something is asunder within the 3-year-old universe

summer camp staff training this week @ CCG- 
thoughts about McDonald's: 1 ) their food is not healthy , but they have a play land for kids ... maybe they should add a gym for adults 2)Happy Meal toys likely account for a large amount of landfill refuse 3)what happened to the rest of the < PROPFIRST > McDonald gang ? 
is thinking & praying for < PROPFEMALE > Dotson's family- 
graduated summer staff training 2010 ... and have 5 CHRRF shirts to prove it- 
Summer officially started today @ CCG-

Ok : WHO would build a 52-62-foot Touchdown Jesus from highly flamable materials then stick a lightning < PROPMALE > on the top and later lament \I don't understand why the lightning < PROPMALE > didn't stop the fire ... \ " Fill in the blank : \ " Why a _________ of course ! \""

Kroger is very excited to offer flu shots , according to the radio ad . #1 since when did a flu shot become exciting ?

Listening to the Reds game on 700wlw . I've found myself following MLB a bit more since they were forced to begin cleaning up their act . 
A tremendous comeback victory for the Reds . Great American Ballpark is lived up to its well earned rep as a hitters park with 6 of 21 hits for HRs .
