Dear Anonymous , please stop taking over my thoughts every day and staying in my dreams every night when i know nothing is going to happen . You still give me butterflies and like i said you're in my dreams every night and it hurts knowing I can't be with you ... Love always , me 
You will be dearly missed my mentor , my friend . ~ R.I.P. Mr. < PROPFIRST > Parker ~ 
would go to Mr. < PROPMALE>'s funeral tomorrow if I could . :'( ~ R.I.P. Mr. < PROPMALE > ~ 
wanting to get over the denial and just have a good long cry over his death . other than that things are finally getting back to normal 
happy valentines day everyone ! ^_^ 
kinda wondering if he's ignoring me now even though he swears he loves me or if his phone got turned off .... 
I don't understand how someone can swear they love you and you break up with them because of reasons then they just ignore your texts and deletes you as a friend . If they really love you , wouldn't they try to get you back ? 
taking placement tests today 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
went to the zoo with dad and < PROPFEMALE > . had alot of fun ^_^ Happy Birthday < PROPMALE > ^_^

What can you do when your own family makes you feel like an outcast and doesn't help you with your problems and even refuse to see that there's something wrong ? ~ 2 days to go ~
