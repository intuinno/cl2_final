the entire week has felt like a thursday and it is annoying me >:| 
doing precalc . then probably read the first section of the odyssey , then doing the ast and ant reading i've been not doing . i don't like reading . 
just finished < PROPFEMALE > wars #1 . i love my college buddies , they are so much fun to be with :) 
Pascal Francis-Mezger I NEED MOVIE TIMES PLEASE !!! and thank you 
not feeling a whole lot of love . 
“The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends . I mean , life is tough . It takes up a lot of your time . What do you get at the end of it ? A Death ! What's that , a bonus ? I think the life cycle is all backwards . You should die first , get it out of the way . Then you live in an old age home . You get kicked out when you're too young , you get a gold watch , you go to work . 
plans for this weekend : friday- ast , ant , mat , movie . saturday : odyssey . sunday : NOTHING RELATED TO SCHOOL , FOOTBALL IS ON AND I WON'T MISS IT . 
as i was thinking about the fact that tonight was the first time i'd been in sandals instead of my step ups , i trip up the stairs and jam my big toe . :( 
resident evil was great , and Pascal Francis-Mezger has NO IDEA WHERE HE IS GOING ON UMAINE CAMPUS ! 
watchin ' umaine football game in the basement with some peeps 
even more than i want to talk to u , i want you to want to talk to me 
watchin football in the basement . i'm \multitasking\ " by also doing my homework ( no i'm not ) " 
“The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own . You do not blame them on your mother , the ecology , or the president . You realize that you control your own destiny . ” 
why am i awake this late ? i actually turned my computer back on i was so bored and i couldn't fall asleep . 
one thing i will remember from ant : sexual selection . It's the idea in evolution that the only reason your good at something is to attract a mate and get laid . :D 
i don't want to study anthropology ... blah . 
starting my honors paper , doing that til midnight , creeping fb for a few minutes to see if anything interesting is happening . the last act will determine my bed time 
< PROPMALE > Brazier my mom's response to my orange jumpsuit request : \an orange jumpsuit can be found at your local prison . \ " i ? her "

four full grown peple cannot sleep on our couch comfortably . guys don't share well . 
BRUINS TONIGHT !

shutting my computer down now and getting into bed so i will stop playing around and do my work . solid plan .

does anyone know the cable channel for versus ? i will very depressed if i can't watch the bruins tomorrow 
i like dressing up pretty . thank you mommy and daddy for the < PROPFEMALE > corn

I CAN'T WATCH THE BRUINS ! I'M DEPRESSED !! 
i apologize to < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > for constantly banging my head and laptop off the ceiling . i hope i am not waking u up . 
doctors @2 : 30 . then convincing mommy to take me halloween shopping for my costume . next week is so busy . 
i can't tell if i'm high or drunk . and not alcohol or weed was involved in this process , which makes it all the better . now i'm going talk like a ferbie to myself while i play solitare . ....... colvin , beware the psyco in 204A 
i'm hungry . 530 is so far away ..... 
weekend consists of : honors x2 , two hockey games , precalc , FYS x3 , and probably something else i forgot to mention . i need to stop playing solitaire . 
i am ignoring the fact that the announcers i'm listening to are no where near the nesn announcers because i am so happy i get to watch them online . 
anyone mind if i tag along with u to the hockey game tonight ? 
umaine kicked some < PROPFEMALE > ass ! tomorrow had better be good or i'm not going to be happy . 
snack . nap . shower . homework . hockey game 
ok . i will stay up all night doing homework . sleep when done until one , then watch football uninterrupted . basement is mine ! 
i got 1/3 of my homework done . but i got bored . 
watchin ' football in the basement . and doing homework . its not the same as at home :( 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient onlyhas one : to getbetter . I \

an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still \ 
fighting 
yeah Pittsburgh ! 
damn precalc . you snuck up on me like a ninja 
i got my new headphones and i'm so happy ! 
its a good thing youtube froze or i would have been watchin tv allllll night 
i've decided that humidity is the worst thing ever ! or that my body cannot regulate its temperature 
not only have i been eating salads regularly for lunch , but my soda made me feel yucky . god damnit i'm getting old ! * sob**whimper**gasp**sob**vampire weekend * 
CELTICS ! CELTICS ! CELTICS ! AAAAAAAAH ! :D 
watchin ' celtics in the basement 
usa today oct 25 : umaine men's hockey ranked 6th 
i don't want to walk in the rain . this sucks . < PROPFIRST>'s drenched 
what is the point of the world existing before 9 am . before then , no work force in competent enough to perform their duties efficiently . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Higgins : megamegamegamegamega ! you'll be here for CHOCOLATE THERAPY ! AHHHHH 
< PROPFIRST > Higgins < PROPFEMALE > Higgins : if either of u have a friend u want to come tomorrow , ask because if liv doesn't take my ticket I'll need someone to take it . don't guarantee it , but ask ( and no one annoying please ) 
i'm cross stitching . i invite the world to judge me . its ok < PROPFEMALE > Begley . 
can i get arthritis at my age ? 
learning to tie a tie for her costume 
who is going to the union stuff tomorrow ? 
super cramps = call mommy . thank u nurse < PROPFEMALE > for taking care of me 
SNOWSNOWSNOWSNOWSNOWSNOWSNOWSNOWSNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW ! i love SNOOOOOOOOOOOW ! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! 
i don't know why , but one of my feet is reeeeeeally cold . 
indifference : my greatest personality trait 
watching celtics online because i can never find the channel or an open tv . 
went to write my honors paper , and realized i lost the prompt . silly me , where's my mommy when this happens ? 
shutter island was worth not watching the bruins slaughter another team -- for < PROPFIRST > , if miller had been the goalie i would have stayed . 
i'm bored . i don't even want to watch tv . thats how bored i am . 
thinking of going to the preceptor things . free pizza and it is two floors about my head . 
i feel safer in the honors dorm , knowing that if all the < PROPMALE > potter peeps turn on me , < PROPFEMALE>'s got my back . yeah ! 
looking at my wishlist , i have almost 30 credits for next semester . hmmm pretty sure that isn't gonna work . so italian , costume making , pysch , sociology , creative writing , world religion ... some of u r gonna have to go . calc and honors , ur staying . 
mommy wasn't suppose to let me on the computer til my reading was done . 
i was so mad at myself when i thought i didn't get out of bed til 9 because that meant i needed almost nine hours of sleep . then daddy reminded me to change my watch so i did get out of bed at 8 YEAH ! 
i get back to school and i feel like blah :P and i have classes for the next 5 hours every-other hour , on the hour . 
damn salad made me feel better . 
trying to pick a < PROPMALE > is distracting me from honor's homework . i have never done so much work and ended up getting nothing done . frustrated . someone make life decisions for me . 
human vs . zombies started . they invaded york for dinner . it was cool . 
going to take a shower . then meeting with < PROPFEMALE > about my plan to be a professional student ( if i never leave college i never have to pay off my loans :D ) 
thank u mr. v for killing poetry in 7th grade . now when i need to write a poem , i can't . 
epiphany : i have the < PROPFEMALE > to < PROPMALE > something at a wall and somehow this will allow me to successfully write this paper . 
Who\ 
actually knows me .? I bet Not many people can answer all the \ 
questionscorrectly ! First name . : ____ Middle name . : ______Last \ 
name . : _____Age . : _____Birthday . : __/__/__ Eyecolor . : _____ Nickname . : _____ Favoritecolor : _____ Best Friend(girl ).: _____ Best Friend(boy ).: _____ Put this as ...... ( i did this so my sisters can butcher it like i did theirs ) 
plan : since i wake up at 8 everyday , i could work out atleast mwf before class @ 11 . status : failure . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Dumont : do we have classes off tomorrow for veterans day ? emcc does ? 
honors essay . i'm putting it off til after dinner because i have an nscs meeting in an hour or so . 
the sunset would be beautiful , if it wasn't 4:30 
solid 2 hours of procrastination that i will regret when i don't get my honors paper done enough to pass in . this is going to be one sucky draft . 
taking a nap before pep band . honors paper still not done . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stevenson < PROPFEMALE > Begley Zac Knights r u guys going to the hockey game ? 
it is sooooo frustrating when u cannot beat your best score in a game no matter how hard u try . 
< PROPFEMALE > O . < PROPMALE > stop liking everything i do , u make me feel important when i see the red flags . 
greatest discoveries of today :\ 
even if its just a draft , i wont want to turn it in if it sucks\ 
with enough salt you can't taste the occasional burnt popcorn piece\ 
my cute < PROPFEMALE > background makes me smile EVERY time i see it ( squeal ) 
doing my hair , then getting breakfast or lunch ( whichever is being served ) and going to play at the basketball game . then home 
i don't appreciate dumb-asses screwing over my sisters . especially when said dumb-asses don't even deserve to speak their names unless it is in a hushed , awestruck voice . 
i never realized how annoying being a student group @ umaine was until all the seats in the union are taken up . 
i'm bored . fys then doing precalc until an optional dinner . then studying for ant on wednesday . 
official : cannot be a teacher . the only way i understand precalc is invoking lots of variables and algebra , and the teacher explained it using pictures . 
i think i listened to the same song for three hours straight . \ 
cool . 
all registered for classes . thank you so much < PROPFEMALE > ! 
umaine needs more places to sit . they have over 10,000 faculty and students and maybe 600 places to sit outside of classrooms . 
likes knowing she is not the only one who only studies the day before a test 
i think i am going to return to a dorm with lots of people bouncying off the wall because of < PROPMALE > potter . i am scared 
sale @ the bookstore = xmas shopping for orono students ( even the guys were getting a head start ) 
was freaking out about using her debit card to buy stuff . but after checking her account , she wants to splurge on herself because its her money . my first irresponsible action ( marking calender ) . 
i don't know if i like being the person someone has to check over their shoulder for when they leave colvin . 
Change\ 
your profile picture on Facebook to an image from a cartoon from your \ 
childhood . The goal of the game ? Not to have a single human face on \ 
Facebook , but an invasion of our collective childhood memories for a \ 
week 
where's daddy ? 
i almost got trapped in a elevator that is tweaking out . screamed like a little girl . 
i can't tell if i'm tired or getting a headache . :( 
going to be up at umaine for less than 36 hr for about 3 hr of classes . damn bball game 
speed reading chinese poetry -- which makes so much more sense than greek . 
task one : precalc done before dinner . 
it feels like its humid and cold . i don't like it . 
task two : fys and/or honors write before/during bruins game . 
i don't know how to get all the way across campus with my flute without getting soaked . 
i feel like i have a lot of homework to do , but since i can't think of anything in particular i'm gonna put my room back together . i am almost never unproductive . 
looking at the date on your watch is a bad idea at 1 am because the brain can forget to process that it is the next day and you did not screw up any plans . yeah . 
i think i hear < PROPFEMALE > wars about me ? or maybe beside me ? there is someone watching a < PROPFEMALE > s movie in colvin right now , i know it ! 
go away sun , you're making the snow disappear . 
i hate reflection papers . 
I didn't think a college snow day could be topped by anything ... until I saw < PROPFIRST > ( he's from alabama ) this morning . 
i now have the next two weeks of my life planned out on < PROPFIRST > mouse sticky notes . 
it not allowed to do anything fun until her honors prompt is done . 
can't focus . only got one thing done on my list = fail . tomorrow is going to suck . 
i just smile when people talk about how they are getting into the game tomorrow . pep band is the GREATEST . THING . EVER ! 
last class tomorrow ( it actually today , i have dates at 1 am ) , then all thats lefts is studying , finals , and pep band ( i'm only looking forward to the last one . 
oh yeah . loving pep band . 
delivered hot chocolate to a crazy umaine line ( which threated to throw snowballs at me ) all so i wouldn't break a promise . and didn't stop smiling all the way back to the library because i was so happy i did . 
only hw left is an hour of ast and organizing ant notes . too bad my room is so cold my fingers stop functioning after 30 minutes . i'm hungry 
basketball game then lots of studying . 
today sucks and it's not even noon . :'( 
i accomplish more things not on my list ( but still important to me ) . 
\Stewardesses is the longest word typed with only the left hand\ " \ 
\You can't kill yourself by holding your breath . \ " \ 
\No word in the English language rhymes with month\ " \ 
\You ! Off my planet ! \ " \ 
Toto , I don't think we're in December anymore . 
< PROPFEMALE > Stevenson Zac Knights : I have gone with the wind and might have Howl's moving castle if u need a copy to watch . 
studying astro and going over my honors stuff . day off tomorrow so selling my books back . 
thank you < PROPFEMALE > Vail and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Rourke for the cake . YUM ! 
plan for the next 18 hr : w/ out < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > i will be very lonely , so i'm gonna bug the crap out of < PROPFEMALE > LoConte til i leave . :D 
i'm avoiding screaming out loud during while watching the bruins so those left in colvin don't think i'm crazy . 
spending my last night watchin the celtics . at least all see ONE boston team win today . :'( * bruins * 
scholarship searching sucks . 
? i'm so lonely , i have nobody , to call my own ? \ 
colvin is so empty and quiet . and i'm bored . 
all by my lonesome . 
home for three minutes and i already ticked off the cat . YEAH ! 
i think my cat actually understands the word no . i didn't have to flail my arms or raise my voice and she stopped treating the dining room as a jungle gym . 
pretty sure i broke some toes ....... yeah , there was swearing involved 
after all the soccer thrown ins and softball games , it has to be cross stitching that messes up my shoulder . wtf . 
10 guys thrown off the ice at once . BEST FIGHT EVER ! 
not being very good elves for mommy . but she loves us anyways . 
decorating cookies and watching zoey attack her duck . \ 
and attacking < PROPFEMALE>'s foot with my hair claw ( hehehe)\ 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS ! and happy all the other winter holidays 
zoey is the cutest damn thing in the whole world 
unsalted butter tastes as good as splenda . :p 
settling back into school 
i thought i was lazy last semester , MWF i have one class at 1 pm . i hate waiting . 
itunes is so annoying . why cant ipod touches use windows media player ? :p 
finishing my honor's reaction is one of too few bright moments today . where the hell is friday . 
it is not even snowing at umaine , why the hell are all these schools closed . this is MAINE . 
today's evaluation : it sucks . 
i now remember why i never wanted an ipod before : i don't like using itunes for my music 
very pissed at the mailing service right now . i could have driven to brewer and back faster than my damn packages , one of which is now delivered in \orono\ " -- campus or town i have no idea which . " 
Talking from iPod touch . * Squeal * 
Hockey game then home . I love my iPod touch 
Spying on people at the game . Hi < PROPFIRST > , Finn , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Darien . Think that's all of u 
Maine won in ot ! 
i have now proven to myself that I am ( no matter how lazy ) an < PROPFEMALE > catholic 
suck it and enjoy things for what they all . The only thing between the lines is a blank void 
honors reading = done . now i just have to write the paper and i won't have to wrry about it over the weekend . yeah ! 
there are no cooler students on the UMaine campus , than the pep band . how many people can do the hey song with only the drum beat as a prompt ? 
I don't like the person who got me sick . If I can't enjoy band day u r not allowed in the room anymore . 
flu 
flu was not caused by stress from school\ 
stress about school was caused by the flu 
i don't mind coughing , but the car sick feeling really needs to stop . i have work to do . 
Classes r gonna be fun tomorrow if this nauseous all the time thing doesn't stop . I don't wanna take anymore drugs 
new low : playing tap zoo and geo < PROPMALE > quests 
watching all-star hockey stuff all day . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > aren't on the same team :( 
i am now ..... a red(ish ) head 
mad at this new first class , i can't upload my document without copying and paseting into stupid 
AHHH !!! Lengyel is still there . I couldn't see it for an hour . phew 
it should be illegal to assign any studying or reading around Superbowl Sunday . lets face it : nachos , soda , ribs and chips vs . st. < PROPFIRST > , psyche , anthro and journalism/editing . 
the snow is soooooooooo pretty outside . it's so quiet and would make great snowballs and snowman 
I am in the textbook example of an abusive relationship . umaine hockey : u need to stop ripping my heart from my chest and stopping on it . </3 
my text book just taught me that \fud\ " means a rabbit's butt and \ " Elmer fudd\ " was always the butt of Bugs bunnies jokes . Ahhhh ! " 
never , ever , EVER let me get bored near craft supplies ! \ 
EVER ! 
going to firework with < PROPFEMALE > and then game . it had better be better than last night 
umaine won and I got a third of my long paper done , all but reediting on two short papers , and got called qt . night = good 
i'm paranoid when the minute something pops up on my computer that looks like a hacker thing , i shut off my internet connection , run THREE different computer scans , and check my firewall . 
i did homework almost all weekend and am still behind on my reading . not happy . 
papers beware : if you are not up to par , do not let me get a hold of you . for I have just made a simple three < PROPFEMALE > essay into a boss of a seven < PROPFEMALE > r . in fact , there is probably more blue ink then black on it . 
task for spring break : make a list of all the absolutely horrible mean and all together hillarious inside jokes my little part of SDHS has together that are the perfect example of why i will never want children out of pure fear they will end up like them . 
OMG < PROPMALE > cook is gonna be on Hawaii 5-o AHHHHHHHHHHHH ! 
to < PROPFEMALE > Lil'hale: i am about to go into the room . i hope i don't wake u up in the process but since i suck at being a ninja there is a good < PROPMALE > i will . so sorry in advance . 
take this health nuts ! \ 
\Diet Soda kills brain cells because they use so many chemicals to make it \ " diet \"...\"" 
< PROPFIRST > was right . defiance is AWESOME ! 
very glad I took groenings psych class 
i want my hair trimmed and my favorite pair of jeans replaced ( stupid drier ripped them in a way no one can fix ) and my favorite shirt to come back to me because you have runaway and off-white vanilla frosting for my vanilla waffers\ 
where's my mother ..... ? 
< PROPFIRST > ! I found the stupidest game on my iPod ! u will love it ! 
two languages are separate when they are mutually unintelligible , but what if no one understands the language then want is it . \ 
I have two list of over a hundred mis-spelled or used words I need to look at and I don't want to so this is a distraction . 
I hate the English language . not only is there American , British , and all the other places that speak it in their own little ways , but there is mla ap Chicago ny times Washington and every other < PROPMALE > newspaper and writing pros different styles . and I can't even begin the like of American dialects and slang . 
not doing any homework until next week . 
hanging around campus isn't going to be as much fun if I'm allowed . I was going to enjoy being an illegal and float around campus . 
I think I'm stuck here . either wait until the morning to leave or take four hours driving home with stupid over confident drivers or idiots not from New England who will swerve to avoid every snowflake . \ 
I want my hockey game to start . 
thinking about exploring colvin to see who else is here .... 
move over macgyver . 
still seats at game come watch 
I <3 umaine hockey . u guys are absolutely awesome ! u can pack the alfond during a freak snow storm and spring break . 
enjoying umaine basketball . not quite as exciting as hockey but it's my team so they are always worth watching . 
has misplaced license and mainecard . sweet :p 
love new haircut

it is okay to discuss a situation to yourself . it is not okay when you are losing an argument with yourself . 
attempting to get over none of my sports team winning yesterday . :,( 
am trying soooooo hard to do my writing but feel like i'm running a prius at a stone wall at . 000012 mph and expecting to crash through it . 
thank u text book . I would never have guess caffeine interfere with sedatives . go figure . 
popping tic tacs . i only have my dads super strength gum so this is the only alternative 
something that will throw u for a loop at 1:30 am : seeing the UMaine add video before watching a youtude video . was not ready for it 
seven almost solid hours of homework is third only to procrastination and the juicy juice challenge in stupidity . 
it is so nice out today 
finished < PROPMALE > , going to write paper ........ an got distracted by youtube . yeah ! 
number one reason not to procrastinate : 7 hour \recommended but actually required\ " video . wtf . no . " 
it's too early 
fun = bus rides with large groups . go eagles ( new pep band joke ) 
never have i done a homework assignment where I have episodes of giddiness . :D 
YEAH my Ipod lives ! 
I sang to a stuffed animal in my car because I'm sexy and I do what I want . 
softball+soccer = kickball\ 
kickball+people of Colvin = one of best college memories ever 
will not be able to physically move out of my bed today , if I can even get onto my bed 
A NY Yankees , NY Mets , and Red Sox fan are climbing a mountain , and arguing about who loves his team more . The Mets fan insists he is the most loyal . '' This is for the Mets '' , he yells , and jumps off the mountain . Not to be outdone , the Red Sock fan is next to profess his love for his team . He yells \This is for the Red Socks !!! \ " and pushes the NY Yankee off the mountain . ( Repost if you're a Red Sock Fan fan !!! " 
< PROPFEMALE > Bradshaw I went clubbing with < PROPFEMALE > Tossi last night

I WON BINGO ! and was excessively excited about it . :) 
fu college . i have to much work to do and you go and schedule a campus-wide fun day . 
I think the pep band was the only one who enjoyed the parade ;) 
OK . I was totally terrified when my ipod sent me an espn alert . HELL YEAH BRUINS ! 
most awkward thing to watch : < PROPFEMALE > beating the crap out of gill , but gill is a bruin and < PROPFEMALE > is senator . 19/50 grates nhl fights 
it's one \s\ " . just one . >:[ " 
i think i figured out why staplers have two ways the back of the staple can look ( if that made any sense ) 
i have a spam email saying the FBI is going to arrest me for terrorism if I don't fill out a form that costs $750 to get . this person should probably get away from their computer and get a job . 
i'm just as excited watching replays of sports as I am when they are live .

i don't feel so hot :p
