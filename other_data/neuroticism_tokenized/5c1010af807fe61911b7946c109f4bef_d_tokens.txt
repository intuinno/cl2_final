Happy birthday , 2011 . 

It's called correct grammar . Use it . Yes , you . I see you trying sometimes , but still , you fail . It's not that tough . Just learn it . \ 
\ 
And no , this isn't directed at any one person , it's for all of you . 
Oddly enough , there is a strange lack of work to do tonight . I don't even have to put anything off , because there's nothing to put off . =D \ 
I already know I'm going to be bored at some point , though . >.< 
I'll admit , not much can beat Ice Steam Roller Vodka Optimus Prime . 
I told myself \I'm gonna have this done by 11:00 PM . \ " \ 
Uryuu got himself a cell phone . 
Accidentally carved into myself with a pencil . Owie . 
Next time the hair gets cut , the spikes shall return .

The suns in this Physics book are amusing with their facial expressions . \ 
One sun says =) \ 
One sun says :o \ 
One sun says ;3 \ 
One sun says S= ( Yeah , he's facing the other way lol ) 
The guy who wrote this Physics book deserves more credit than we all give him . \ 
After explaining a paragraph about magnetic tides and cosmic < PROPFIRST > penetration blah blah blah , there's an asterisk . Down at the bottom , it says :\ 
* Could this be why some of your friends seem a bit weird at the time of a full moon ? \ 
Vague werewolf allusions and suns with emoticon faces ... This guy tried to make it interesting , didn't he ? 
\Any dolt with half a brain can see that humankind has gone insane to the point where I don't know if I'll upset the status quo if I throw poison in the water main . \ 
Facebook has a 420 character maximum on status updates . For this reason , to find the real status update , check the notes < PROPFEMALE > . 
Okay . I'm not taking one of those water bottles to school again . I'll just go thirsty instead . 
Om nom nom nom nom . Nom om nom nom om nom . Om nom nom nom , nom nom om nom , nom nom nom . Nom nom om nom om , om om nom nom om nom om om nom nom nom nom om nom nom om om nom nom om nom . 
I need a new image . \ 
Anyone volunteer ? 
If you happen to be a former Nazi experiment , please inform me now . 
If someone speaks to you in < PROPMALE > , and you don't know < PROPMALE > , you can still understand what they're saying by the happy faces and hearts in their statements . 
Evil is sooooooo fun ~ \ 
I <3 EVILLLL ~ 
I FEEL SUCCESSFUL ! \ 
Ikkeh ! Hurry up ! Can't do it alone ! xD 
Who knew that was such a cure for a not-so-positive mood ? \ 
Just get an emoticon named after you , and you're good . xD 
YEAH ! THAT'S RIGHT ! \ 
I'M A HALF-NAKED BLACK MAN ! DEAL WITH IT ! 
Ikatsui : YES !! RESTARTED ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > Ornan : For a second there , I thought you were insulting me . xD 
MI GATO ES EN FUEGO ! 
November 29 . \ 
Today is Hug a Gamer day . \ 
Anyone want a hug ? xD 
BEG RELATED STUFF THAT PRETTY MUCH NO ONE BUT < PROPMALE > GETS 
Oh no . Cupcake craving . =/ ? 
So my cat < PROPMALE > is pretty much everything in the universe balled up into one little package with a flabby fat flap . \ 
Except for one thing . \ 
No matter how much I ask , he does not become this one thing . \ 
Love ya , < PROPMALE > , but I'd rather you replace yourself with the one thing . =/ 
\The juxtaposition of two orbicularisoris muscles in the state of contraction . \ " What's the word ? Figure it out . Cheating is not recommended .? " 
So ... Why doesn't the snow feel cold today ? =/ 
Ugh . There's really no explanation , and that's what bothers me . 
Okay . So walking outside in a t-shirt and sandals ( even if it's only for a couple minutes ) is sort of a mistake in this weather . Especially when one doesn't realize the trash cans are frozen over and one has to bash it open while snow is leeching into one's feet . 
Send me a number in my inbox and I won't mention anything about you in a profile update . 
If it burns , it's either acid or fire . Or Listerine . 
Hey snow . Go away . 
Well . At least it wasn't canceled . 
So everyone knows slow and steady wins the race . But what about fast and steady ? It's pretty much exactly the same , only fast . =\\ 
How many bites does it take for you to eat a gummy bear ? 
It isn't December anymore . I should change my picture back to one that is actually me . But ... I don't want to . =\\ 
Heyheyhey , 2011 . Be a little nicer , will ya ? 
Oh , The < PROPFEMALE > Letter . Why can you not keep my attention ? 
Oh , hey , I just remembered . I have Science Olympiad stuff to be worried about . Crap . 
Double Truffle Shuffle Trouble ? O.o 
If I don't fall asleep now , I'll have less than six hours sleep for tomorrow's event . However , I'm not tired . What luck .
