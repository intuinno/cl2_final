life is a picture , some people love it , some people hate it , some people don't understand it , and some people dont care about it - Amaad Arif

west got pwned by < PROPMALE > yesterday :( 
im going to take a practice psat tomorow at kd 
one man can make a difference only if he believes he can 
life without love and compassion is meaningless 
weak men commit suicide , strong men smile during the toughest times 
telling lies is easy , but telling the truth is hard that why it is easier to write fiction in stead of non-fiction . 
although the its the tough people that stand up in the face of danger , the people who back down from it are usually the smartest 
hey im the platoon sergeant of bad company in jrotc , where war is the answer to everything , and we follow the way of the fist
