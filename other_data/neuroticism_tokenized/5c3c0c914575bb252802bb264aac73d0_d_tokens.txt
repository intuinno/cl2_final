When you start to let go , it brings much pain but soon enough the pain will let up and you'll have a second < PROPMALE > see clearly to have your dream come free and shove it in the other person's face ! 
I watched Sasuke 25 ( Ninja Warrior ) and I saw the most unbelievable stuff I've ever seen !!!

Depressed alot right now ... 
Summer is over , was pretty short , school tomorrow , and I am goin have trouble sleeping tonight ! 
School once again each year , ugh ! 
School wasn't too bad , I didn't even feel like a new year ... 
I should sleep good tonight ! 
School was ok , I like all classes execpt Acounting 2 cause I didn't pick it at all ! 
I am doin ok 
School , it just sucks so much . 
Been just thinking alot for the past week on many things and it ' ;s hard to accept things the way they are , I wish I ccould do something about them but I just can't and I am just stuck on what if this ... 
Last night was fun with < PROPMALE > Penland and < PROPFIRST > Tyczkowski . It was awesome ! 
School , ugh ! 
Off tomorrow ! 
Everyone I know that is a guy had a girlfriend by now , I never had one . Most of them < PROPMALE > after their looks but not personality . I go for looks but I decide to get to know them so a relationship can last longer . I am shy bout asking girls out and people rub it in my face but all I have to say is that I am human and just me , not someone else . I am not a rushing type to get a girl really at all . 
You don't even care , \ 
when I think to even dare ! \ 
I cry out you soul , \ 
begging to be whole ! 
For the past few weeks I've been trying to think possitve about life and once night hits , I go into a state of a depression and it's just about < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and I just don't know why it haunts me all the time but I am just stuck an endless battle with myself . 
nking my Rockstar Cola and chillin now ... 
Moving to the future , \ 
on my better adventure ! \ 
Is it my cue , \ 
to say I love you !? 
think about a poem , it'll be about glasgow Sports 
I am having a blast watchin the lightening ! 
My cardio improved by a long shot , way better runner now but not to fast yet . 
When the < PROPMALE > rage war , it's the poor who die ! 
Going to a Party Today 
Last night was awesome with < PROPMALE > Penland < PROPMALE > Yñiguez < PROPFIRST > Collazo < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Winn and < PROPFIRST > Tyczkowski . Tired , sick , and THE GAME right now !!! 
I am chewing 6 feet of gum right in my mouth ! 
I don't know how to ask her ... 
A poem has been writen but not sure how I will present her with it 
Alot of people can say \no\ " with ease but me it's hard for me to say \ " no\ " because I think it's rude to so I try to say it a more nicer manner . " 
This day reminds me of the time < PROPMALE > Penland lost the game ! 
Almost had a girlfriend but rejected because of religion , this sucks , oh well at least we are friends still :) 
My name is in Japanese 
\I am the greatest Earthbender in the world\ " ~ Toph ~ " 
Got back from the Y , intense workout and I saw < PROPFEMALE > Alaiza Stephenson and Zach < PROPMALE > there .

My tounge will hurt for the next few days because I ate alot of sourpatch kids and the licked the cirtic acid on the bottom of the bag , my tounge hurts so bad right now ! 
We cannot change the past , we cannot predict the future , but we can make life last , if I were to change . 
Just got watching < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . the World and I loved the movie , it had comedy , romance , and action to it ! 
am too damn bored right now , I can't < PROPFEMALE > with anyone right know !

I am so bored 
I just got done walking for over an hour . Right now I am just thinking about the past and the future . 
You live life easy while I had to go through it all , \ 
You had a mother and a father , I had only a mother for 4 years ! \ 
My way I had to crawl and claw , \ 
All you had to do was not shed a tear ! 
Getting ready to watch the Eagles game , gonna hunt those Bears down . 
Eagles lost and now we are tied with the Giants again but they are technely in the led because they are on a win streak
