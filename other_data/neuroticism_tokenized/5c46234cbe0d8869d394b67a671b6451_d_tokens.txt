it's amazing how effective Disturbed is at drowning out your own thoughts . 
And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God , to those who are called according to His purpose . -Rom 8:28 . I much prefer to focus on loving God and trust the almighty God to work out the rest , rather than focus on worrying about my problems and focusing on me . 
There are some days where it feels like it was really worth it to wake up . I can already tell today is one of those days and I thank God for it .

So ..... I graduated and got a job offer in the same day . AWESOME .

Government is not a magic box where you throw your problems in and they come out fixed . Government is a philospher's stone . Somewhere along the way \ppl\ " are sacrificed to make the \ " magic\ " work . " 
have you ever had one of those days when everything inexplicably varies from broken to fixed . It's similar to being thrown from sahara hot to artic colds rooms in sucession multipe times .

If I had a world of my own , everything would be nonsense . Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't . 
Whatever you do , do your work heartily , as for the Lord rather than for men - Colossians 3:23 . Any work we do , not just 8-5 jobs , should be viewed as an opportunity to glorify God through the use of the skills he has blessed us with , rather than something we have to do or an opportunity to fail . 
indeed , we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead - 2 Corinthians 1:9 . The beginning of our Christian walk is understanding that we must trust God to save us from our sins . The perfecting of that walk is remembering this and using it to help us understand we must trust God for everything else . 
I don't have a lot of money , so I can't screw the rules .

Just played a demo for El Shaddai . Upon starting this game , I looked over at < PROPFIRST > Majeska and had him assure me I had not taken drugs recently . Drug use was the only way this game made sense , hence I needed the confirmation from an outside source . 
As I walk into my apartment which does not currently have power , quickly realize how relevant electricity is in my life since the last 5-10 things I've decided to do have been vetoed by lack of power .

11 Days 
in the middle of the night , \ 
i don't understand what's going on\ 
it's a world gone astray . \ 
i can't let it out . \ 
someone keeps searching\ 
and shatters your life\ 
it will never be afraid\ 
in the middle of the night\ 
10 Days 
Stand my ground , I won't give in\ 
No more denying , I've got to face it\ 
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside\ 
If I don't make it , someone else will\ 
Stand my ground\ 
\ 
9 days 
See who I am , \ 
Break through the surface . \ 
Reach for my hand , \ 
Let's show them that we can\ 
Free our minds and find a way . \ 
The world is in our hands , \ 
This is not the end . \

Angels have faith\ 
I don't want to be a part of his sin\ 
I don't want to get lost in his world\ 
I'm not playing this game\ 
When the shadows remain in the light of day\ 
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate\ 
He'll be falling from grace\ 
Till the end of all his days\ 
From the ashes of hate\ 
It's a cruel demon's fate\ 
On the wings of darkness\ 
He's returned to stay\ 
There will be no escape\ 
Cause he's fallen far from grace\ 
7 days 
Why was I one of the chosen ones ? \ 
Until the fight I could not see\ 
The magic and the strength of my power\ 
It was beyond my wildest dreams\ 
Dark wings they are descending\ 
See shadows gathering around\ 
One by one they are falling\ 
Every time they try to strike us down\ 
6 days 
Good Trip , Good to be back in < PROPMALE > 
Once you will know my dear\ 
You don't have to fear\

I'm searching for answers\ 
Not questioned before . \ 
The curse of awareness , \ 
There's no peace of mind . \ 
As your true colours show\ 
A dangerous sign . \ 
4 days 
We've been seeing what you wanted , got us cornered right now\ 
Fallen asleep from our vanity , might cost us our lives\ 
I hear they're getting closer\ 
Their howls are sending chills down my spine\ 
And time is running out now\ 
They're coming down the hills from behind\ 
3 days 
In my darkest hours I could not foresee\ 
That the tide could turn so fast to this degree\ 
Can't believe my eyes\ 
How can you be so blind ? \ 
Is the heart of stone , no empathy inside ? \ 
Time keeps on slipping away and we haven't learned\ 
So in the end now what have we gained ? \ 
2 days 
Please awake\ 
And see the truth\ 
He can only be\ 
If you believe what he tells you\ 
Remember who you are\ 
What you stand for\ 
And there will always be a way\ 
............ \ 
In my heart there is a place\ 
In my heart there is a trace\ 
Of a small fire burning\ 
A sheltering < PROPFIRST > shines through this night\ 
Although it's small , it's bright\ 
But darkness is lurking\ 
1 day

It has begun 
NYC and Within Temptation were AWESOME . Great Vacation . Back to the grind tomorrow . 
I forgot how good old school Bleach is . Thanks Netflix . 
SAFETY DANCE . I love Pandora . I wonder what percentage of my status updates have ' Pandora ' in them . probably a plurality . 
Ever since the Within Temptation concert , every time I've hear Ice < PROPFEMALE > I get pumped . also Pandora rocks , for continuity sake . 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
Thanks Pandora , now I'm in a < PROPFEMALE > Kanno mood . Ironically , that probably means I'm going to stop using Pandora for the day to listen to more < PROPFEMALE > Kanno . 
and finally I get to start playing the new Dragon Age DLC 
So I just ate my second chocolate espresso bean and washed it down with DDP ( Diet Dr. Pepper ) . In theory , that should be quite the interesting energy boost ...... 
Shouldn't be so trusting . Mwahaha . - < PROPMALE > Scaggs
