That party last night was awfully crazy , i wish we`d taped it ... 

Oh what a night that turned into what a day ! I brought 2011 in the right way , now its time to post up with a movie & reboot for tomorrow . 
Figuring this out :-P 
Oh my gosh ! I woke up to 727592 messages with birthday wishes , thank you guys so much :) YOU Have an awesome day too !! 
Always tell the people in your life who mean alot to you that they mean alot to you . You never know what could happen & if you feel by saying it too much the meaning is lessened , remember that eaxh time you say it could be the last . 
I think .... I`m a workaholic . 
That`s right , watch them Steelers beat down the Raiders . 
Our laundry says \New ! Rinses clean ! \ " so i`m wondering how it rinsed before ? " 
Even though all i did today was Nothing , i feel like i did alot & it`s a good feeling . 
Stopped by home and recieved two bear hugs , one from dad & one from < PROPFEMALE > . It made my day . 
\The Red Cross gives out doughnuts during disasters because carbohydrates take the edge off stress . Proven scientific fact . \ " Thats all the justification i need . " 
I`ve worn the same hoodie to work for two winters now but only this year people notice how cute it is lol compliments at work definitely make my day :) 
Spending thanksgiving with our best friends was the best way we could have spent it . Now we`re on our way up to lookout mountain to finish the day off right ;-) 
So the wind that feels like ice kind of ruined our trip , but it was entertaining climbing & freezing together . 
Successfully introduced < PROPFIRST > to the extended Merryman family today :) ... Love ... 
< PROPFIRST > always talks smack when i whip out the photo albums & start clipping & labeling away , but when we`re old & have these to look back on he`ll appreciate it . 
It`s like my mom just knows . Every time i have a bad day she sends me an encouraging text even though she has no idea how much of a difference it makes . 
So you took the time to do a full face of makeup , a perfect bump with curls , but you could only summon sweats and slippers ? I don`t get girls these days . 
Please don`t mistake my anti-social tendencies for bitchiness . I`m just a quiet person . 
What would life be without music ? Dead . 
Parade of Lights tonight with the gang :) thank you december , for not being too cold ! 
Finally got registered for classes next semester ! Come January I'll be taking geography , math , biology , and public speaking ... Feeling very relieved right now :) 
Dear straightener , please don't sit on the edge of the counter where I'm likely to set my hand and burn the hell out of it . Thank you . 
I`m not sure what it is that makes me want to steal boyfriend`s clothes , but i do . They`re so big & comfy :) 
Come on Steelers , don`t let me down ! 
Having such a hard time with life . 
Grandparents said they`d cover all my tuition for my first semester , sooooo thankful ! 
Locked the keys in the house , broke the window trying to get them , misread my check ( so i was expecting 496 but it was only 469 ) and now i`m just like , fml . 
Got my nails done wih the bestie today :) thanks maryn , it was just what i needed ! 
You were given two ears and one mouth so you can LISTEN twice as much as you talk . 
Mom is in town today ! Yay ! 
Just burnt a good inch off my left bangs hittin that . Good job . 
Having dinner with my mom & little brother tonight , he`s so big ! 
\I love you as big as the whole world ! \ " five year olds say it best :) " 
Going to KushCon with the bestie & hubby today :) I love having another ticket to add to the scrapbook 
Taking mommie to the airport today :( missing her sooo much 
Tryin to keep my < PROPFEMALE > up . 
Pay day ! Ah , what a way to lift a girl`s spirit :) 
Girls day out with Maryn , gettin our nails done & some shopping , today is gona be good :) 
Just another thing to add to the list . Anyone have a car for sale ? fml . 
Annual Christmas < PROPFEMALE > bowling with the fam . I am such a scrooge , lets just get this holiday business over with . 
I feel like a little girl holding hands in mittens . Walked on a frozen lake for the first time today . 
The Merryman family gathers again , pie at my great-grandma's was nice . Seeing her on oxygen breaks my heart , this only-see-each-other-on-holiday business has got to go . 
Dear Burger < PROPMALE > workers , thanks for being open & giving me fresh fries . Sincerely , the butthole sitting in the lobby 
Wake & Bake 
Pen meets paper , scribble scrib-scribble . 
You know those nights where you know you have to be up early the next day but you stay up late anyway ? Yeah , I`m kickin` myself for this one . 
Snowboarding ! Lets get sore . 
Snowin pretty good up here , all fresh powder means speeeeeed . I love living in Colorado ! 
Found my inner peace standing out on the dock at Sloans . The sun was setting and the duckie prints on the ice made me appreciate the little things . 
* Drum Roll Please * This May will bring me a little SISTER !!! 
I keep all the mean words inside me because I`d rather not fight than win the fight . Take a lesson . 
Dear You-tube-ers , \ 
I'm sorry for talking so much shit about you , I'll admit this how-to video was a great help . But that's all you're getting . \ 
Sincerely , me 
I smoke two joints in the morning , I smoke two joints at night . I smoke two joints in the afternoon , it makes me feel alright ... 
Good times with the homies :) 
Bought all my textbooks , relief doesn't come cheap . 
Just found the words for my new tattoo , can't wait to get in the shop & under the needle ! 
I feel like i live at work . 
Why can`t anything ever just go right ? One simple task just go as planned ? 
I went to Target for highlighters & came out minus thirty bucks & with no highlighters . Fail . 
Goodbye journal number five , it's been a great eleven months with you but now I must lock you up & start fresh on blank new pages . 
< PROPMALE > & Busters , you make me regret not carrying hand sanitizer with all your games & little monsters . 
As if work needed any help sucking , I forgot to eat & almost passed out with low blood sugar immediately after clocking in . Gota remember to eat ! 
I`ve already burned 47902681 calories looking for this building and i still can`t find it . 
Why does it feel like no matter what direction I`m walking the snow is blowing at my face ? 
The rule is , treat others the way you wish to be treated , not treat others the way they treat you . There is a difference , learn it . 
Looked at my check & there was a raise :) made my day ! 
Amazing day shopping with the bestie :) 
I just answered my cell phone \Hi what can we make for you ? \ " My abs are going to kill tomorrow from laughing so hard . Damn Mcds . " 
I worked for 8 hours , went for an hour walk , and now i`m going to happily sit on my ass for the rest of the day & enjoy doing absolutely nothing . 
My doggie hopped the fence , got hit by a car , didn`t make it . :-( I`m gona miss you < PROPMALE > :-( 
Perk of buying used textbooks : someone already highlighted the main ideas for me . 
I guess when it comes to her I don`t know how to be anything but naive . I don`t know how to face the truth . It`s too fucking hard . 
I hate school . 
Work much ? \ 
Me : Good morning\ 
Little Old Man With the Long Grey Beard in Drive Thru : Hi Juno ! You weren`t here the other day & I didn`t like it . 
It amazes me that everytime I get on fb all anyone talks about is the weather . How long have you live in Colorado ? It`s just some cold , not the apocalypse . 
It's okay Steelers , I still love you losers . 
College isn`t for everyone . I`m learning how true that is . 
For once i actually did a homework assignment at home ! Before it was due ! Astonishing . 
Just put the pen to paper and hope the words come out faster than they drown you . 
:))) So happy ! I'm getting promoted to manager ! Wooo :) 
It is true what they say . Busy-ness keeps the sadness away . 
Found money in my hoodie pocket getting dressed today . A sign today will be good ? I think so . 
This public speaking class is going to give me a nervous breakdown . I`m so scared . 
iPod on , volume up , bass in my bones .. music is my coffee . 
Dear Wind , \ 
Please stop blowing my skirt up . I know these leggings make my butt look great , but I like to leave at least a little to the imagination . \ 
Thanks . 
Hell`s on its way to freezing over , I just got my permit . 
Kudos to all the cool teachers I've had throughout the years . It only takes one bad one to make you miss all the great ones . 
If you were to write an autobiography , would it be interesting ? Yes , yes it would . 
What , because I work at McDonald's I must be too stupid to detect your blatant condescending tone ? Well I hope you choke on your damn double cheeseburger you ignorant waste . 
Church . My babe . The peeps . Good damn times :) 
CEC kids , somehow everyone knows everyone from every year and every grade . It's a little crazy . 
Just got my tickets to the March 19th Bad CD Release ! Excited :) 
escaped reality for the last 48 hours ... Must go back now . Sadly ... 
It feels great to be in a skirt again :) get some sunshine on these white legs of mine ! 
All the crazy shit i did last night , those`ll be the best memories . 
zombie 
Get up , meet up , toke it up , 9 hour shift , change them clothes , meet back up , bowling . Nonstop baby . Great Friday indeed , and it`s only 10:30 yet :) 
The Gump said it best , shit happens . 
Discouraged . 
Sick as a damn dog . I`ve missed school because of this , i just had to call into work ... Seriously , i just want my life back . 
When it rains , it pours . 
Drove a car for the first time today ! 
You know you`re a true Colorado girl when then weather man says 68 and you whip out the shorts . 
:) did I mention we've been together three years today ? <3 
Stress is going to kill me one of these days . 
Bad CD release tonight ! XD 
The Bad show last night was sick ! Had more than enough fun to makeup for this tired :) 
It always feels good when someone says \I miss you . \"" 
Today is going to be great :) 
I wish I could record my conversations , because the inspirational words sometimes get lost in the memory & a cheat sheet would be helpful . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Just finished a biology assignment about genetic defects . It broke my heart a little & made me appreciate my healthy body and mind . 
Took a risk & stood up for myself . Turns out confidence is respected . 
As the world tilts milk is spilt , but I'm not gona cry ... No use fighting gravity so I'm not gona try ... 
All torn up . 
Went for a long walk , just me & my ipod ... Feeling so much better about life :) 
Love is being together 3 years & still finding yourself thinking about him all day , excited to see him like before your first date . 
Who drove to and from work today , all by herself !? Meeee :) Finally facing my biggest fear\ 
, and conquering it one < PROPMALE > block at a time . This is exciting :)
