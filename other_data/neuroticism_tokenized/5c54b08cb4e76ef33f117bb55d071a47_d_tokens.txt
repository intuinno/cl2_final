Today is the last day I get to spend with Rie before she goes to the hospital for 10 days . Unfortunately , we need to spend it all shopping and preparing for her stay . :( However , on the brighter side , can't wait to meet my son ! :) 

< PROPMALE > and Rie are doing great ! Gonna take < PROPFEMALE > to the zoo tomorrow and possibly the movies too . 
Forget potty training . I''m going to teach my daughter how to wash dishes . That's much more useful at the moment ..... 
Rie and < PROPMALE > finally came home from the hospital ! Yay ! 
< PROPMALE > went into the hospital again and will be there for a week :( He has Pyloric Stenosis and has to have surgery tomorrow to fix the muscles blocking his stomach passage . I hope he can eat better after this :( I can sure use all your prayers . Nothing wo 
Only a month and a half left of this crummy company :) Excited to be returning to the States and I hope and pray that I'll be able to find work of some sort :) < PROPMALE > is doing so great ! He gained over two pounds in 16 days :) 
Passing this on : < PROPFEMALE > ALERT IN OSHWA NY-3 YEAR OLD GIRL TAKEN BY A MAN DRIVING SILVER TRUCK Ontario PLATE # 728 381 . If all of you reading my status would copy and paste into your status , it could potentially save a little girl's life . I would want someone to do it if it were my child ! 
Heading off to Fukuoka tomorrow to get < PROPMALE>'s American Passport and SS Card . Things have been going smoothly so far for our move so let's pray they continue that way :) 
Back from Fukuoka had a lot of fun and relieved that it's done :) 
We are back in the States heh . Yeah I know , I've been here for over a week now , but we finally managed to get respectable internet which is quite difficult to do here in the middle of the woods :) Thank god for mobile internet . :) Sorry to all who expected to see me but I didn't show up . Both kids had a nasty case of jet lag and that meant we were up late all night as well . :( 
it's DOPPLEGANGER WEEK ! during this week , change your profile picture to someone famous ( actor / musician / athlete ) you have been told you look like . 
< PROPMALE>'s just hit the seven month < PROPFIRST > and , just like his sister at his age , is starting to refuse sleeping in his crib ....... Just when I thought we finally got our beds to ourselves . 
Hmmm . Today I have reached that all too unimportant age of 31 . Even though I may feel older , I have comfort in knowing that I will always be younger than Rie :) 
Well today has proven to be a dismal failure .... The point where I realize that I may have left a good life in Japan for nothing .... I really do try to love this country we live in , but it is hardly the land of opportunity it pretends to be .... 
Working on my new life plans and trying to make Lemonade outta all these lemons ... 
Last run of < PROPFEMALE > in the Tropics is over . Had a fun time on this show ! Now I get a short break til November when Dearly Departed starts up :) 
Yay ! Started a Detox Diet right before Thanksgiving ! :) 
I am so mad right now , I don't even know what to say .........

< PROPMALE > .... Man , when will this boy stop scaring us ? He had a seizure at 3 am this morning , scared us all to death !! Called ambulance and spent night at hospital . He was diagnosed with a febrile seizure meaning it was just fever induced ... Nothing worse than watching your kid go through something scary like that and all you can do is watch him and let is pass ... 
Heading off to Symposium . Wish me luck ! 
Ok two more weeks then my life can go back to normal :) 
Another day older , another day deeper in debt . Yay ... Thanks for all the birthday greetings guys ! Love you all :) 
Back from Stetson Auditions . Sang my two pieces better than I have ever < PROPFIRST > them before , but sight reading and piano proficiency tripped me up :( I messed up on two of the sight readings but they allowed me to try again and I got them both . Was fine until piano proficiency asked me to play an F Minor chord . My mind went totally blank haha . Oh well . Hopefully they saw potential :) 
Hey guys ! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Yoshiharu was born On Saturday March 26th at 7 am ! He weighed 5 lbs 13 oz and I will take the camera to the hospital tomorrow to take some pics !
