oh , brain . why have you forsaken me ? the semester isn't over yet ! :(

it is times like these that the toughest part of college , is actually dealing with the paperwork . ( not UHD of course , but a certain institution has made it's life goal the complication of any associated online processes , such as a transcript transfer . One would think that your info , the receiving address , and some money would suffice . oh no heheh , they want your soul . ) 
i think 2.5 hrs is enough effort to prepare a DSC sample . If the film refuses to go in the pan for that long , its just not meant to be and we'll just have to leave each other alone for a while . 
wants to go back to Convey Sushi
