CAMP SUNDAY !!! GO BAND GEEKS ! 

can you buy a gift card with other gift cards :) 
Great < PROPFIRST > . 
Goodbye back and forth year . I'm glad to finally be rid of ya . Now maybe things can be a little more stable 
The power of love is a curious thing . Make a one man weep . Make another man sing . 
1:11 1.1.11 just passed 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > boom boom 
I have skittles :) 
< PROPFIRST > said she was gonna bite kittykat :) 
so ............. i offered my brother a cool opportunity ..... he laughed in my face and humbly declined .......... i wonder why ........ never mind ......... most people would say no ..... even if you did call them comrade or agent .......... :) 
i'll never look at apples the same .... 
I have chocolate ! :) 
Rain . . . 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh ! 
Ugh . . . So tired 
ÀYa know i'd probably read more if the school system didn't require it :) i don't get how they can just get off telling us what to read , what not to read , 
À and when to read it . Ya know if they gave me a couple of books to read over the summer i'd probably get those done . I read more book over summer vacatio 
Àn last year then i've read during the school year since 6th grade 
I love marshmallows :) especially in < PROPFEMALE > form 
:( my flower died :( and it lasted so long 
There's a creepy guy sitting outside my house :/ in a big truck too . Just sitting there . Scary 
He's gone and my dad's home so i'm safe now :) 
I'm home :) i win 
Shadow's gone . We found lucky but i don't know where shadow is 
Shot through the window a couple times but at least both cats are inside now and won't be getting out again . Hopefully 
I'm swinging :) 
It's that time again :) 
All the blood's rushing to my head :/ dizzy 
If you want the rainbow , ya gotta put up with the rain 
Okay . Who wants a scarf ? I have a half finished one . I'll finish it if someone wants it . It's black and green . I don't want it to go to waste . 
I'm gonna eat french fries for lunch tomorrow . Maybe :) 
I'm hungry . . . 
I'm so sleepy :( 
:( gotta leave the library ....... i bet < PROPFIRST > ate my ramen noodles while i was here 
:) my noodles were still there when i got home . And they were warm too :) 
I wonder . . . How long can you have the same status ? 
My mom's a meanie ! :) 
:'( i'm bored 
Sword fighting with shelbykins :) 
These turtles taste like turtles ! 
No . . . We don't like milk . . . 
Loved beauty and the beast ! Got to see an alto flute ! :) the play was good too . Go salt ! :) 
I'm surrounded by a million fire breathing dragons ! How am i supposed to be expected to sleep ! :( 
I finally hit the tree ! XD 
My mommy loves me ! :) she got me a whole bunch of new head bands ! And they're stretchy too XD 
Pink and White Fuzzy Ball Disease ! Ah ! :) 
This wind always kills my hair . It blew me over too :/ 
I kept sayin two twin brothers when i realized that it was a little redundant . :) if they're twins there has to be two me them :) 
My stomach hurts :( 
Critical blow averted :) 
Who's going to the < PROPMALE > potter marathon ? 
Wow :) the blind side was amazing 
Finally found my cork grease ! XD 
It's not dead < PROPFIRST > it's sleeping :) 
= B <-- Mator :) 
i'm sorry ....... i understand now ........... 
Never worry that i might be asleep . I'll stay awake to talk or i'll apologize when i wake up . But never hold back cause you think you might bother me 
The rewind button won't work . . . The batteries are still good . . . I think my life dvr is broken . . . 
Have i fallen off the face of the planet ? >=/ 
I think < PROPFIRST > clarkson said it the best 
How can you see into my eyes like open doors ? Leadin you down into my core while I become so numb . . . 
Don't think too hard about this . If i were diagnosed with lung cancer , what would you want me to know before i was put in the hospital ? 
Today absolutely has to be better ! :) there's no doubt bigger than a pin in my mind 
Facebook isn't really a good friend to me anymore 
You know what ? I'm ready for band tomorrow ! Nothing could keep me from what i love the most ! >=) determination ! 
How come it seems so loud when everything's so quiet ? 
L . E . T . :) 
NSomeone told me the strangest thing today . It was like they were asking me who had died . I have no idea who was strangled to death in 1956 in the congres 
Nsional library . If someone was they probably needed to up security :) 
Ow . . . 
Wow . . . Today . . . 
Madre day ! 
I'm not putting myself down . I'm just not standing up to get knocked down 
My face was hurting so bad 3rd and 4th block 
I miss my < PROPFEMALE > . . . 
I've got way too much time on my hands 
I can't see me lovin nobody but you for all my life . 
Ya know if you see ice woman crying the last thing you wanna do is ask if it is a sign of the apocalyps . 
Biology is great but the leaf project sucks :) 
My dad freaked out cause i said i was cold :) he keeps checkin if i'm sick 
I don't think i've ever been so jealous in my life . :) i'm such a bad person 
I hate when you're at the library trying to do something important and they kick you off the cpu 
I can handle being laughed at and tortured the rest of the year :) there's only one month left and i'm not gonna let you stop me from making the best of it >=) 
Erase all ? . . . Erase . . . Erased . . . Finally ! :) 
My cat just decided that it would be hilarious to use my outfit as a restroom >=( ugh ! I'm taking a shower . . . So gross 
Poke a bored and things will happen ! Velcro ! Did you hear about the chinese people ?!?! With weird lookin fish ! She's a freakin bird ! The crackin ! Water c 
an cut you in half !? OMG ! Love ya stubby :) 
I'm disabled ! Ah ! It's so tiring 
< PROPMALE>'s a creeper ! :) 
Hey Who thinks i should try out for guard ? 
°Why is it that some friendships can end at the blink of an eye ? And another good question is why do i think longer and harder on my past than i would on 
°my present or future ? 
What should my next status be ? 
Yeah it's true :) i do love chicken 
You're not young at heart . You're an idiot 
Ew . . . I need new toothpaste 
I almost missed my bus , because my disablity makes me walk slow 
Even though i've done flag before it's still the hardest thing in the world 
Yeah my face is bleeding . . . A lot :) 
Wow i just dumped my dinner in the floor and now my cat is eating it 
I'm so sore ! :( i ache all over 
Yay ! Pizza ! XD 
Okay you can ignore me all ya want :) i have pizza though so i still win :) 
I hate when you try to poke someone and you can't because they haven't \received\ " your last one >:/ " 
`When you poke someone it says you're gonna poke the person then you poke them and it tells you you've just poked someone . What's the point of that ? Is fa 
`cebook afraid you'll forget or something ? When someone pokes me you don't see a big ol ' bubble fly up saying you just poked < PROPFEMALE > hall 
I cleaned out my pockets finally ! :) now my jacket is like 2 pounds lighter . . . That's a big accomplishment for me :) 
Wow . . . I love how much life sucks sometimes . . . Sigh :/ 
Yes dad . . . I'm a girl . . . We all know this . . . Stop talking about it like it's surprising . . . I don't need to be introduced as your female daughter >=/ 
I figured out i can't ride my bike with the flag so i really need you to remember to check me out from school early ! 
Okay i can now do the impossible :) i've got some help 
Ha :) i'm ready for the test tomorrow 
No matter how many times he breaks your heart , you'll still love him with all the little pieces 
Don't waste your time with stabbing yourself in the chest when you know your heart's not in there :) 
¥Okay how's this for a status update ? Stop repeating everything i say ! I'm not literal all the time and i'm sarcastic a lot . Either read my status and get 
¥ over it or wait until there aren't witnesses ! And yes i just called you out on facebook 
Gaga < PROPMALE > gaga 
You know when i hear the word authentic the first thing i think is \pft . Fake . \"" 
How come when i'm finally on time everyone else is late ? 
I want pizza 
Why ? Why ? 
I'm gonna puke . I hate my life 
Learn to love the pain cause it just keeps comin 
I am not ready for this morning's concert . I'm gonna have a heart attack and die right there on the risers :/ 
Are you allowed to be your own favorite super hero and worst nightmare at the same time ? 
Can you tell me when you're gonna go through my texts ? I'll take the time to get rid of the ones you won't like 
I didn't lose any friends today ! :) and i saw < PROPFEMALE > as i went past < PROPFEMALE>'s 
Wow :) people really think i'm that violent :) i can hurt my family but i can't hurt my friends . They're closer than family 
I give up on the leaf project 
The bus stop is boring 
This lady just ran into the curb right in front of me !!! How do you even make a turn THAT badly ?! 
Yes ! :) i'm comin tonight ! 
Smoothie threesome ! At the mall ! 
Yeah we're just loitering here . Not doing anything illegal again . . . We've just been followed by the cops 6 times tonight . . . 
Car wash at the walgreens at mission blvd and crossover . It's free come ! 
Car wash over 
Hey ! Who else was nominated for the aam ?! XD 
This calamari tastes like popcorn shrimp 
Um . . . Do you think it's hot outside ? Cause i'm still freezing :/ 
Oh yeah :) no one could ever forget a night like that :) especially the cops 
This is exactly why i've never melted before . . . 
I'm sorry for all the times i couldn't force myself to say it outloud ! I love you guys ! 
I finally got to 15 on my sos . . . 
I'm not much of a chatterbox , but boy can i write . You make me feel sorry , to have to say goodnight . ( c ) 
ýI'm sorry . But the answer has to be no . And it will always be no until she says yes . I won't lose her . I'll hold onto her like you didn't . She's my siste 
ýr . Not your accidental toy 
All nighter comin up ! Woohoo ! . . . Not . . . I'm gonna be so tired tomorrow 
This is as close to all night as my dad lets me get :) 
Biology observation ! 
Hopefully today will go pretty well . . . If not i'm screwed 
It went great actually ! Well . . . I didn't get decked at least :) 
Ugh . . . It's gonna be my first time back since the beginning of the month . . . Wish me luck . . . I'll need it 
I'm here . . . Probably won't be able to talk until 7 . . . I'd appreciate it if people would text me then . . . 
What is < PROPFIRST>'s status about ? I can't see it :( 
Lucky is on the roof and i can't get him down :( 
It's raining . . . 
It was nice knowin you guys . . . But i'm going down . . . Death by guilt . . . 
I hate myself for losing you 
ÌHow will i solve tomorrow without you here ? Who's luck will guide me when all the answers disappear ? Is it too late ? Are you too far gone to stay ? Best f 
Ìriends forever should never have to go away . What will i do ? You know , i'm only half without you . How will i make it through ? 
And if the river's too wide i'll get through it . And if the mountain's too high that won't stop this dream of mine . I'm on my way . I've got a plan . I'm m 
akin my way any way that i can 
ÚI don't feel like having a conversation right now but i still feel bad . So . . . I'm sorry for calling you a jerk . But you shouldn't say things like that 
Úto me when i'm upset . Anyways my point was sorry . 
Life narration : Right , left , right , left , right , left . . . Repeat until at bus stop . . . 
She doesn't wanna kill me :) she just wants me to leave you alone 
I made an actual hole ! :) in the tree ! XD 
What are you playing at ? Are you just curious or are you plotting against me ? >:') it's conflicting me . 
My dad just told me to go move into mcdonalds . . . He said i could get a job there and sleep on a cot in the back room . . . Nobody better tell me i need 
to talk things over with my dad ever again . . . 
Unconditional love huh ? You should take a listen to the things you hear in my house . \ you're a screw up and i can't wait till i can have you thrown out " 
of my house ! Wait ! you may not make it that long ! \ \ " i hate you ! \ " \ " likewise ! \""

There's a typo on my plaque ! :( 
You have no idea how hard i worked on this curl :) 
Grrr . . . I worked so hard on this curl and it's already falling out :( it took me half an hour to get it to curl with my straightener . . . 
ËOkay i'm not saying no to you . I'm just saying i'm not ready to say yes yet . Just give me a little time . If you still want a yes after a little while the

 s hurt . . . I hope everyone else hates this biology review as much as i do . . . Good thing there's no school tomorrow . . . 
I am officially finished ! Free at last ! Free at last !! XD 
7Life is full of horror stories . Some are yours . Some are mine . But no matter what , we'll go through them together , because i couldn't stand to see you tr

Wrist swollen :( arg . . . 
It's not important . Forget about it :) 
Still swollen . . . Crap . . . Maybe it'll heal over night . . . The makeshift wrap is workin though 
Ew . . . Loose blood under your skin feels gross . . . Hurts too . . . 
Now i'm feelin the nostalgia 
|Nostalgia is like . . . Memories flowing back . And they don't necessarily have to be good . It could be a beautiful wonderful memory . But it still brings p 
|ain because you know you can never go back to the happiest days of your life . 
Hmm . . . I wonder if sleep is finally possible . . . 
< PROPFEMALE > left her phone with me wow what a dumb 
Rawr ! I ate < PROPFIRST > and retrieved my phone !

Jump indie ! Jump ! 
Help ! I'm bored . . . :) 
Did you know there was a show called 10 ways to kill bin laden ? 
PSo . . . In the end nothins really gonna change is it . Just our families will get older and fade in and out . Our friends will change faces on us for < PROPFEMALE > 
Pr or for worse , but even a bad friend is really just a good friend hidden by your own bad feelings . Pets will come and go . So will marching season . Baseb 
Pall will slide through . You'll leap over obsticals without ever lifting a foot off of the ground . You'll sleep through some of life that you wish you had 
Pn't . Other times you'll wish you had stayed in bed . The good the bad and the stating of the obvious all come with life :) , so take some medicine and keep 
P on truckin . > live life laughing < 
iMet a girl named < PROPFEMALE > today . She was cool . She plays the clarinet and she's just here for the summer . We played this hasbro game cause we didn't know 
iwhat else to do . 
Why ask why if you're afraid of what the answer might be ? 
é-magic- < PROPFEMALE>'s seen a leprechaun , < PROPFIRST > touched a troll , < PROPFEMALE > danced with witches once , < PROPFIRST > found some goblins ' gold . < PROPFIRST > heard a mermaid sing 
é , < PROPFEMALE > spied an elf , but all the magic i have known i've had to make myself . - Shel Silverstein 
Life is a sausage :) 
It's dark in here . I am writing these poems from inside a lion , and it's rather dark in here . So please excuse the handwriting which may not be to 
o clear . But this afternoon by the lion's cage i'm afraid i got too near . And i'm writing these lines from inside a lion , and it's rather dark in here . - 
 Shel Silverstein 
Ugh . . . More bad news . Aunt < PROPFEMALE > died 
Swimming . Fun 
LListen to the mustn'ts . Listen to the mustn'ts , child , listen to the don'ts listen to the shouldn'ts the impossibles , the won'ts listen to the never 
L haves then listen close to me -- Anything can happen , child , anything can be . - Shel Silverstein 
That was an odd phone call . . . 
off the griddle ? Terrible < PROPFEMALE > smiles and says , \i'll take the one in the middle . \ " - Shel Silverstein " 
Yawn . . . 
There's always a point in summer where i resort to doing nothing but reading and sleeping and that time has come . . . 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > :( would someone tell her that if she doesn't look at this ? I need to apologize for being a turkey ! :) 
Taco- A ramrod , billiard cue , or gulp of wine . :) 
My alarm clock is 37 seconds slow when compared to my phone . And yes . I counted . 
On my way to band camp ! Yes ! Too bad it's jr high so i don't get to stay . . .

st week . I've been trying to hold out but today i was way too excited to stop myself . Well i don't know if < PROPFEMALE > has read my status from last week and 
i don't know if anyone has told her about it but what i do know is that i hate saying or doing personal things in public but if it means < PROPFEMALE > might he 
ar about this then i'll do it . Dear Aril , in case i don't get a < PROPMALE > to see you or talk to you before our camps start i wanna tell you to have fun a 
nd wear way more sun block than you did last year . If you're missing me now then be sure not to miss me while you're supposed to be having fun at church 
camp . Being missed feels nice but missing someone feels like crap . The pain i feel right now from missing you is enough to make me want to stay in bed fo 
r another week . But i'd gladly be this sick and jump in front of a bus ten different times just to secure your happiness . Or ten different buses within t 
en seconds of each other if you'd perfer . Even if it didn't make you eternally happy i would still do it if you just needed a chuckle when you were down . 
I've been posed this question many different times by many different people : Me or your flute ? I've never once answered that question . For anyone . Now i 
will gladly say i will pick you < PROPFEMALE > over my flute any and ever day . And if it were my ability to play the flute or even enjoy it ever again i'd have 
to say you are one of the only people i'd give up both my life and flute for . Even if i had to watch my flute be completely distroid and melted down for 
parts . You're irreplaceable . I'm so so so sorry and i hope this at least starts to help you forgive me . You're my sister . A celestial friend . I love you 
as much as both of my blood sisters combined . I hope you get this , TuRAH . Okay letter over but note to the world before i stop talking : I don't n 
eed help with any psychological problems i may have . I'm just a desprite teenager trying to reach to one person and one person only . My BFFL . but please 
fell welcome to show her this . :)
