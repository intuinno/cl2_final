Nice to know my opinion is important ... -.- \ " , 2009-08-22 22:36:29 " 
So , the end of summer is closing in . Tomorrow's the last day .. Somehow the feeling that i lacked any actual accomplishments makes this summer feel just like the others . A total Failure and the thoughts of how I could've used this time wiser ... 
< PROPFEMALE > ... First day of school , Lets see what you'll have in store for me 
Dam . First Day of school was epic boring .. and epic sucked ...

Being majorly pissed off never felt so good 
Ahh , GH fireworks never cease to amaze me ... Now , what to do , what to do .. 
When the body is tired , exercise the mind . 
It sucks being the good guy in the world today . Good guys be getting their asses kicked by life , all day , everyday , But there is a bright side . Every once in a while life has the courtesy to leave their shoes jammed where the sun doesnt shine , so you can use them to finish walking through all the glass it laid out for you .

\I know I've got a face in me

If we are going to the trouble of getting everyone their own separate car , why must they take mine to go see < PROPMALE > Olsen with my neighbor and her brat child . I understand sharing and all that , but my mom and my sister both have their own cars .. they NEEDED to take mine ? just cuz my mom's is too messy for 4 people to sit in . Sorry if I offended anyone I'm talking about , I just got really angry about it for no reason . 
Happy December Everyone ! And a happy bday to < PROPMALE > Windham 
Haha . People hate me . I really wish they'd tell me about it , instead of tell my family to yell at me . Nothing new though . I get angry easy .
