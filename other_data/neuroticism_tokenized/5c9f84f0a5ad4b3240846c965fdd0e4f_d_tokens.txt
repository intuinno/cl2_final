has a secret . 

is having too much fun keeping my secret a secret . 
secret's out . 
Thanks everyone for all your prayers and well-wishes on our amazing new journey . What an incredible outpouring of love and support . We've been so blessed by all your comments . Now the wait begins . 
got an email from our placing agency in Seattle today telling us we are ACCEPTED into the Ethiopia program !!!! WAHOOOOOO !!! Now to start the homestudy ! 
swimming in adoption paperwork ..... you are worth it , baby girl . 
Conversation with Caeden today ... Caed : \There's a monkey in my ear ! \ " Mama : \ " There is ? \ " Caed :\ " Yep . \ " Mama : \ " What's he doing in your ear ? \ " Caed :\ " Swinging on a tree . \ " Okay then . " 
best thing I heard all day was when our social worker said , \I think this is going to be a really great fit for your family . \ " She'll have it all written up by the end of the week !!!! Sweet ! " 
had THE WORST case of hiccups tonight , the boys thought it was hysterical ! When I told Judah ( through hiccups ! ) to go get ready for bed he said to me , \Somehow I just can't take you seriously right now ! \"" 
so now < PROPMALE > has decided to name my left hand \Shirley\ " . He said he just liked that name ! And he's been talking to my hand (\" Shirley \") all evening . Where does he come up with this stuff ?? " 
loves that < PROPMALE > spent the whole evening trying to tell me how to fish , even though I was the only one catching anything ! 
My sons are having a \brother party\ " in their room . A pile of blankets and pillows and boys and snacks .... and playing \ " Trouble\ " . Fitting . " 
My boy turns 13 on Sunday and I'm just sitting here looking at my profile picture and thinking about how thankful I am for his life . First we were told we'd never have children of our own , then Judah almost died at birth and the doctor told us he'd never leave the hospital alive , and now he's turning 13 on me . His life is such a gift from God . 
so Caeden just told me that snapping turtles live in the jungle , and they're orange and they eat cookies . He said he learned that on < PROPFEMALE > . 
and p.s. while picking huckleberries this morning Caeden told me that when I was a baby I looked like a bucket and I was blue and he held me like a bucket . Hmmm . 
Just read my eldest sons new quote on his facebook < PROPFEMALE > . \Nobody's perfect . I'm a nobody . \ " Good gracious . " 
Funny story ... we got home from staff retreat last week and after all the laundry was done and put away , my favorite jeans were missing . I searched every bag , in the < PROPFIRST > , high and low . No jeans . Well , did < PROPMALE>'s laundry yesterday and guess what was in there ! MY JEANS ! Apparantly he wore them at some point this week and none of us even noticed !!! 
Caeden is totally fixated with all things that rhyme . For the last two weeks he has called me \Momma Pomma Somma Lomma Jomma\ " . I think it might just stick . " 
quote of the day from Liam yesterday , \Albert Einstein ... is he the one who made Frankenstein ? \"" 
Liam dressed himself in a half-zip fleece that he's unzipped all the way down his chest . When I told him he needed to have a t-shirt on underneath , he looked at me like I was from another planet and said , \I'm Wolverine . \ " My mistake . " 
and tonight Caeden told me he was thankful for ... his brain ! My word . 
Total Dumb & Dumber moment happened at my house tonight . Came home to find the ice cream scoop still inside the ice cream container in the freezer . So before I put it in the sink I did what any normal person would do . I licked it ! My bottom lip FROZE TO THE SCOOPER !! Had to use the sink sprayer to run warm water over my lip to get it off ! 
Sure is hard to make this rum cake for the staff Christmas dinner when Judah leaves his turtle swimming around in my sink ! 
spent the morning visiting < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s home , Monticello . When we were leaving Caeden said he really liked his visit to \Uncle Jello's House \"!" 
Why is it that my sons never get along better than when they're trying to kill each other with nerf guns ??? 
My < PROPMALE > is amazing . Last round of allergy testing today and he got 74 shots IN ONE ARM ... and then what do you suppose he chooses to do with his evening after he gets home ? Go with me to the base and help with dinner clean-up ! I mean seriously , is this child an angel ???? 
Although I'm certain I have the most awesome teenager on the planet , there are times he still baffles me entirely . Like just now I walked into the living room to see his big teenage feet propped up on the recliner , one sock on and one sock off . When I asked him why he only had one sock on he just said , \I just didn't feel like putting the other one on . \ " Okay . " 
watching a movie with the boys tonight and Caed just wouldn't stop talking . I finally told him he wasn't allowed to talk anymore during the movie . He looked agitated and finally said , \If I burp or toot am I still allowed to say excuse me ? \"" 
Caeden's favorite thing in the world to eat is a turkey & cheese roll-up . At lunch today , < PROPMALE > asked him , \Why do you like turkey & cheese roll-ups so much ? \ " \ 
and furthermore ... I was feeling really crummy after all that testing this evening and left Caeden's laundry on his floor . < PROPFIRST > went in to tell Caed goodnight and found him putting his own laundry away ! He'd folded his pants , put everything in it's proper drawer and even < PROPMALE > his shirts in his closet ! The child is FOUR ! I take no credit for this , he is simply a gift from God ! 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > putting Caeden to bed and they are singing at the top of their lungs a little song that I wrote .... so special ! Now my day is complete ! 
Well , we built an igloo and it was SO FUN !!! But then it collapsed with < PROPFIRST > and Judah inside ! Bummer , since it was hours of work , but still funny at the same time watching them emerge from under the snow blocks ! 
Happy 11th birthday to our < PROPMALE > Jaron . I love your devotion to those you love , your quick sense of humor , and your passion for all things fun . I've never wanted to hug or strangle anyone more than you ! Maybe that's why you're my favorite ! :) I love you , my < PROPMALE > , and I'm so proud to be your mama . You are a gift to our family . 
played laser tag on my fractured heel tonight . Just couldn't help myself ! 
Just thinking tonight about the miracle of adoption and so grateful that God is allowing us to be a part of this miracle , and also so grateful for the mother He chose for me . I am so blessed by the family He put me in and I had to change my profile picture to a photo of me and my mama to celebrate the awesome and life-changing gift of adoption . I am utterly and ridiculously blessed . 
So great to have my Judah home from filming today ... we had tea and talked and talked and played blokus and I whooped him soundly . It's back to the grindstone for him tomorrow .... and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > get to go ice fishing ! It's been < PROPMALE>'s dream since we moved here five years ago . I'm so excited for him ! Here's hoping for fish for dinner ! 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > are on their way home from ice fishing right now , and they've got fish for dinner !!! 
I love my little Caeden . After < PROPFIRST > had him all tucked into bed tonight he called out to me , \Mommm !!!! Momm !!! Come in here .... I want to pray for your foot ! \"" 
Judah's off for a day of filming snow mobile scenes . This movie business is brutal ! :) 
going to a \foot doctor\ " this afternoon ..... answers please ! " 
New xrays and a new diagnosis on my foot . Tendonitis . Doc said my foot shape predisposes me to it , lucky me ! So , four more weeks in this boot . Dang . 
Hello every-one , how are you all ? 
So it seems my < PROPMALE > was accidentally using my facebook login to do all his facebooking today ! I have no idea what was said over facebook using my name today , so if I sounded like an 11 year old to any of you ... just wanted you to know , I WAS ! 
at dinner a moment ago Caeden looked down at his plate of Moroccan lemon chicken and said with his grouchiest voice , \I'm too whiny to eat this . \"" 
Caeden had the hiccups tonight and he said , \I'm so glad I have the hiccups . \ " \ 
My husband is so wonderful . He just came all the way back to the house to bring me a blueberry scone ! It's so nice to be loved so much . 
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone . -Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch 
Caeden just < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and I a picture of the three of us in a car . When I asked him about it he said , \That's me and you and Daddy going to the dentist to get our warts taken off . \ " Hmmm . " 
have the flu . Everything hurts , including my already owie foot . So grumpy . Need prayer , friends ! 
Feeling a bit better . Thanks to all who've been praying for me ! I'm on my way to bed , hoping to be back to myself in the morning . 
is on the mend . 
is enjoying these fleeting moments of having the teenager home . His big acting career is very time consuming ! :) But he stayed up and had tea with me tonight , so life is good . 
is growing very weary of being stuck in my house with this boot on my foot . Especially with those beautiful blue skies we've had all week . Grumpy grumpy ! 
Caeden's soup was hot at dinner so < PROPFIRST > put an ice cube in to cool it off and Caeden said , \Ice is my favorite thing to have in soup ! \"" 
I might not be wearing green today but I've eaten enough mint oreo cookies to turn my whole insides green so that has to count for something ! 
\Do not let your hearts be troubled . Trust in God\ " ... John 14:1 " 
6 boysies and 1 little < PROPFEMALE > waiting in the living room , popcorn is popping , and we're about to watch MegaMind .... the perfect Friday night ! 
Make that SEVEN boysies ... another just showed up ! :) 
becoming concerned about my feet . I've been wearing this \boot\ " on my right foot for a month now and the last couple of days my left foot is starting to bother me . I hope I'm not injuring the left foot by overcompensating for the right foot . Not sure what to do ! So I'm taking the boot off the right foot for today to give the left one a break . Does anyone have any advice for these kinds of things ? " 
Teenagers playing video games are REALLY funny to listen to ! 
the very fine man is going to a movie with a friend and I'm the only girlie left here in sleepover heaven . Doesn't anyone want to come watch a chick flick with me ??? 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Frase who saved the day and watched a movie with me in the midst of my house full of boys ! 
Did anyone else see the \super moon\ " last night ? Beautiful ! " 
sitting here like a lump while my < PROPFEMALE > and boys clean the house all around me because my feet hurt too much to even stand . Feeling really , really thankful and really , really irritated all at the same time . 
Feet up ... ice packs ... Castle . Going to see the foot doc again tomorrow . 
Foot doc says ... achilles tendonitis in right heel , plantar fascitis in both feet , and some obscure nerve damage to both feet .... more ice , stretches , and really ridiculously expensive shoes and inserts . She'll see me back in 8 weeks . 
Why YES , my team of awesome teenagers DID win the Amazing Race at youth group tonight . Thank you for asking ! 
When I told Caeden today that he'd need a bath after I cut his hair , he said , \I'm going to have a hairy bath ! \ " I found out what he REALLY meant when I went in to turn on the bathwater and found that he'd gathered clumps of hair from his and < PROPMALE>'s haircuts and thrown them into the tub ! Yuck ! " 
Ahhhh Spring break ... how I love you !!
