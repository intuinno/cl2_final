Ah .... NCIS never gets old . :) 
Hey guys , I'm going to have to delete my old fb , someone keeps on hacking into it .... so this is going to be my new one . 
Congrats to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Rhoads on their wonderful marriage ! I am so lucky to have < PROPFIRST > Rhoads as my older brother ! I love them both so much !! <3 
I miss < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > already .... I hope they're having a good time on their honeymoon , and I really do hope they have a long and happy marriage together . 
gets to start painting her room today .... finally :) 
Everyone keeps on telling you to go to school , and get good grades so you can go to college . So you can be whoever you want to be . What they don't tell you , is how much it's going to cost . If everyone wants you to go to college , why does it have to cost so much ? You would think that prices for school wouldn't cost as high as they are . Why can't college be free , like elementry-high school was ? 
School starts again in just 8 days ...... this is depressing ...... I really dont want summer to end yet !! 
Please let it storm tonight ..... we need the rain .... 
Thinks its funny how I've started to watch the movie Clue , ( if you guys havent seen it ... it's basically like the game , taking place in a spooky , dark old mansion with storms all over the place as the characters find out who killed who , in what room , with what ) anyway as I start to watch it , an actual thunderstorm is going on outside ... go figure . 
Gotta love being woken up by your dog licking your face at 3:15 in the morning . ;) 
Hmmm ............ chocolate mint milkshakes ....... :) .
