Happy 2011 =D 

It's too damn hot in this house . 
I slammed my finger in the door . >_< 
Everyone complains about going to school , I guess it'd be kinda stupid if I did . Wouldn't make much sense =/ 
Babysitting in the morning , then me and < PROPFIRST > are going back to my house (: , 
why is it ok to be up this early in the morning ? ): It isn't even 10 yet .. 
Packing up to go home . Then have to clean . And I should finish working on my school books , but that'll probly wait till later . 
Tired >_> 
When we were driving , someone yelled that my sister was a whore , So i yelled back and agreed . =D 
I love waking up at the crack of noon , Makes life so much better . 
Just finished dying < PROPFEMALE>'s hair , then washing it , and then drying it , aaand then straightening it . It looks amazing :) .

It's amazing how people will say stuff on formspring , and when a facebook status says the same thing . They won't post . 
I honestly didn't think I'd get this many questions O.o lmao 
I'm not allowed to have a formspring anymore . Just thought everyone should know . 
I hate waking up at 2 in the morning and then trying to fall back asleep is impossible . 
Just cleaned < PROPFIRST>'s house , cause I'm a good bestfriend =) 
I'm not upset that you lied to me , I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you .

\If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people . \"" 
When you stretch the truth , watch out for the snapback . 
When you realize you've made a mistake , make amends immediately . It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm . 
< PROPFIRST > Kamin : \I look like that one dyke from Grease !! \ " Me : \ " That you do :) \"" 
Watching Baggage :)
