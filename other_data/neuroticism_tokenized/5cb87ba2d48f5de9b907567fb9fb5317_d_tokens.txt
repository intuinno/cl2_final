Dr. Beegle's colloquiem today was fantastic . Poverty is the #1 cause of MANY social problems . 13 million children go to bed hungry in the US . It is NOT a condition that has to be accepted . There ARE enough resources in the world if we distributed them properly & if you think that means communism then screw you . You need to try seeing things in color and not just black and white .

finally got in an < PROPMALE > Thompson class ! i think i may have found a kindred spirit , well ... at least we tested the same on Myers-Briggs ( that's a scary thought , considering that my initial reaction to him was negative ) . i'm hoping someone who appears so rational and logical will be able to give me some clearer answers than \that's where faith steps in \""

OMG went to walmart tonight to get medicine for roommate's fish and got stuck behind a line of \young adults\ " who couldn't even wait to get through the line to pop their cans . so many people desperate for a buzz .... Why do we target the SUBSTANCES as the problems when the REAL issues that should be addressed are the things that DRIVE people to the substance in the first place ? GAH . " 
YAY wal mart no longer sells fish ! best decision they've ever made when it comes to getting more of MY business ! no more poor , tortured , diseased fish dying constantly in walmart puts my mind at ease =) ALSO , 89.1 ( NWPR ) plays amazing jazz all though the night on Friday's , apparently .

injustice/embarrassment can lead to anger which leads to depression . anger is depression turned inside out . be careful what you say to/do to your kids . being a parent is a BIG responsibility , and if you're not prepared for it , don't do it ! too many stupid people in the world already .

Okay everyone : if you believe that special interests should have to DISCLOSE who they are & what they stand for when they pour money into the political system , write to your senators and tell them to vote YES on the Disclose Act .

It's a sad day in < PROPFEMALE > when a senior citizen , working par t-t ime and caregiving for her spouse WITH a private insurance supplement to Medicare STILL can't get dental coverage except for emergency procedures . Shame on us . 
sometimes forgets that there are seriously people out there willing to literally sell all their possessions and give to the poor . wow , what an example . \ 
I cannot imagine living in a jungle filled with land-mines in the middle of a civil war educating & feeding orphaned refugees and providing emergency medical care with little to no training or resources .... 
just baked 4 loaves of pumpkin bread and 3 pumpkin cakes and STILL had to freeze half my giant pumpkin ! 
can't live like this . i need a narcotics tree dammit !

good lord , i am NEVER eating another pig , chicken or cow that is not grass fed and raised like a living creature ... Not a chunk of inanimate calories pumped full of hormones and antibiotics crammed into a dark , disease-infested warehouse and then soaked in ammonia and bleach . Watch Food Inc and you will never want fast food again .

how is it possible that it's summer and i'm already this busy ? man , adulthood ... it never stops does it ?!? 
i don't need tv or radio or noise just to fill space . i don't need images or language or color to occupy my mind . i don't need business to numb pain and fear . i'm alive . i'm breathing and thinking and feeling and what greater gift could life give us than life itself ? why do we always look to the future for change or the past for comfort rather than make every moment of existence anything other than it is ? 
hungry enough i could eat a small mammal !!! there : is that carnivorous enough for ya'll on 4th of July weekend ? Come on breakfast ! ... probably vegetarian lol 
control is not necessary =)
