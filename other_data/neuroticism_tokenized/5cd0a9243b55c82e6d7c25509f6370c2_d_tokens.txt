i got jujitsu tonight , looking forward working with the new people . 
R.I.P. ATURO GATTI , the trilogy with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > was the best shit i ever seen from boxing . 
The dance of battle is always played to the same impatient rhythm . What begins in a surge of violent motion is always reduced to the perfectly still 
looking forward to jiujitsu class tonight

Do not run through life so fast that you forget not only where you have been but also where you are going . Life is not a race but a journey to be savoured each step of the way 
looking forward to jujitsu class in a few minutes , looking to relieve some stresss . 
at the house , bout to eat , stretch then go to jujitsu class . 
Look at life through the windshield , not the rear-view mirror 
FEDOR VS ROGERS TONIGHT ! 
Intent is not a thought , or an object , or a wish . Intent is what can make a man succeed when his thoughts tell him that he is defeated . It operates in spite of the warrior's indulgence . Intent is what makes him invulnerable . Intent is what sends a shaman through a wall , through space , to infinity . 
Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth , so virtue appears from good deeds , and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind . To walk safely through the maze of human life , one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue 
my brothers damn dog waking me up in the morning , never thought a dog would piss me off so much to where i break a window and put a hole in the door . Thinkin i have some anger issues . 
As long as I can remember I feel I have had this great creative and spiritual force within me that is greater than faith , greater than ambition , greater than confidence , greater than determination , greater than vision . It is all these combined . My brain becomes magnetized with this dominating force which I hold in my hand- b.l 
ugh why does it have to be so damn nasty out . 
really looking forward to going to jujitsu class tonight .

Often people attempt to live their lives backwards ; they try to make more things , or more money , in order to do more of what they want , so they will be happier . The way it actually works is in reverse . You must first be who you really are , then do what you need to do , in order to have what you want 
20 more days till 21 ! cant wait . 
They say that dreams are only real as long as they last . Couldn't you say the same thing about life ?

To live for some future goal is shallow . It's the sides of the mountain that sustain life , not the top 
Remember , we are all affecting the world every moment , whether we mean to or not . Our actions and states of mind matter , because we're so deeply interconnected with one another . Working on our own consciousness is the most important thing that we are doing at any moment , and being love is the supreme creative act . - Ram Dass

When you discover for yourself , however dimly , that you are rooted in something that is infinitely vast and potential , you have found the soil wherein you grow unconsciously into a most wonderful tree , the tree of life blended with knowledge . 
the weather has been feeling real nice lately . About to go for a jog , then off to jujitsu . 
who wants to go see the < PROPMALE > vs faber fight ??

Creation in < PROPMALE > is the psychic unfolding of the personality , which is rooted in the nothing . Its effect is a deepening of the personal dimension of the soul 
Springiness and alertness of footwork is the key theme . The rear heel is raised and cocked , ever ready to pull the trigger into action . You are never set or tensed , but are ready and flexible . 
To make the right choices in life , you have to get in touch with your soul . To do this , you need to experience solitude , which most people are afraid of , because in the silence you hear the truth and know the solutions .. 
Everybody can be great . Because anybody can serve . \ 
You don't have to have a college degree to serve . \ 
You don't have to make your subject and verb agree\ 
to serve . You don't have to know about Plato and\ 
Aristotle .... Einstein's Theory of Relativity .... \ 
to serve . You only need a heart full of grace . \ 
A soul generated by love .... Martin < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , Jr.

If Lil < PROPMALE > does not write down songs anymore then what happens when he is in studio in the middle of a freestyle and he fucks up ? does he stop where he messes up then continue or does he freestyle the song all over again ? 
time to get back into shape . 
will you still go to hell even if you had a good heart ?, saved 1,000 people but you were a buddhist ?, does that mean according to the Christian doctrine , that if you do not accept Jesus Christ as your lord and Saviour you will be sent to hell ? i have nothing against Christianity , just those few who interpret it the wrong way .
