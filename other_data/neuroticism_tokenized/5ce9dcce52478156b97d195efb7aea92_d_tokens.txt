Also there is a pass button somewhere on all the < PROPFEMALE > s . You do not have to fill that stuff out after her < PROPFEMALE > . Just find the pass button til you get back to her < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Waiting for my wonderful husband to get home . Kids are being kids and don't feel like cooking lol . Wish he would hurry ! 
My heart just left for work , so I will do my running around early so I can get home and fix him a good dinner and give him a body rub . At least I have his wonderful kids to help me be close to him even when he's away ! 
Spending the day with my family . Mothers Day wkend is going great . Going hiking and on a picnic tomorrow . Missing my baby that made me a mother . I love you Lexi !! 
Lovin Life with my family ! Good luck to my baby girl < PROPFIRST > chael < PROPFIRST > . I know you will make it ! 
My man is finally home . Gonna chill for a bit with the family then cuddling with my hubby ! No picture taking tonight , long day with daddy , lol . 
Changed my < PROPMALE > from paralegal to criminal justice . Can use it still towards paralegal or a wide variety of things in case I change my mind . My 1 1/2 yrs at < PROPMALE > transferred so I am already that far ahead ! 
< PROPMALE > started football practice yesterday ! He is going to be starting quarterback for < PROPFEMALE > Middle ! That's my son , well we owe it to < PROPFIRST > . He taught him how to play and be dedicated to it and not give up . All their hard work paid off . < PROPMALE > signs up for pee wee football June 1st ! so excited !!!! 
I am so torn over what I want to < PROPMALE > in . I am looking into the pharmacy tech so I can work while I go on for my doctorate in pharmacology . I already have 1/2 my classes for the tech program out of the way . Their average salary is $ 100,000 and it is in very high demand and stable . I know I got the brains for it . Going to talk to my advisor about it today . 
I am sorry but I will not accept any friends request from anyone in Indiana . I will never get over < PROPFEMALE>'s death & the way that you people treated her before she died . I am not as forgiving as the rest of my family . Nor will I forget all the stuff & money that < PROPFEMALE > stole from me when she left my house the last time I saw my < PROPFEMALE > . I don't need people like that in my life . This isn't meant for is < PROPFEMALE > . 
We have all of our kids with us tonight ! You know Raychael and < PROPMALE > are so happy . Fixing to watch the new Night at the Museum 2 . Good family night . 
Why did all my quizzes say I am crazy ?! I used to be but my life is so perfect since I found < PROPFIRST > I have no reason to be . But I guess over my son I still am . We all know what I am talking about . 
Putting my man on the bus and going to get all this damn running around done . < PROPFIRST > isn't having a good day . Hope it gets better and he comes home . His family will make it better we always do . Start new classes next Tues .! 
Not feeling to well today but that's pregnancy for you ! Can't wait for < PROPFIRST > to get home so we can comfort each other . I feel better just being around him . And can't wait to hear those daily stories about < PROPMALE>'s quarterback practice ! You go my boy ! 
Daddys home early !!!! Gonna be a good day ! < PROPMALE > is playing hooky ( in 4K ) lol and we are going to his brother's and working in his garden . Just enjoying our wonderful life !! 
I can't wait to finish school so we won't have it so tight . Yeah we live in a VERY nice brick house in a nice location with alot of land & we have some basic nice things , bust just by the skin of our teeth . I can't wait til the day I don't have to tell any of my kids they can't have something they want . My schooling is to make my kids life easier . 
Thinking about my brother . Hoping he is doing ok inside and praying that everything goes okay for his baby girl . He & < PROPFEMALE > is the best thing for her . He is too good of a father to lose her because her so called mother is a fuck up ! I love you < PROPFIRST > ! 
I am so proud of < PROPMALE > ! He went up on all 3 parts of his MAP test ! Still in the gifted classes and doing wonderful at quarterback practice ! Everyone says I am one of the best mother's ever but I guess the proof is in your children & mine are proving it true . Hope we are making you proud Lexi . 
Just got my little red netbook ! I love this thing ! I will never use a regular laptop or computer again . I could fit this thing in my purse if I carried one . LOL 
Just drove all 3 kids to Walgreens to get Silly banz !! Every person in line was buyng them . When I went in I asked the clerk where they were and a customer answered . What is up with this obsession . Even Raychael had to have some ! 
For someone who thinks u should stop having babies if u can't afford the ones u have , well sorry I wanted a girl so bad & haven't had 3 abortions ! Stop having kids if u don't want to pay child support ! I do just fine supporting my own . More than I can say for someone ! 
Sorry about the negativity FB . I just saw something posted about me and had to get that off my chest . Everyone knows I take care of my kids very well and almost half way thru with my BA . 
Okay , gonna forget about what I read last night on here . Like < PROPFEMALE>'s friend said yesterday , people just don't like to see other people happy . Sorry but I am not going to let those 2 upset me . My kids are the best thing that has ever happened to me ! GOD gives them to us for a reason ! ( And it's not to kill them ) < PROPMALE > sees who gives everything they have for him . Actions speak louder than words ! 
Before your kids leave for school today , or if they are younger , or if you don't read this before they go , as soon as you read this , Hug them and tell them you love them . I know astions speak louder than words but you can never tell them enough how much they mean to you . Sometimes it jsut makes them feel good to hear it ! 
Lovin ' Life and lovin ' my family ! Just enjoying the day with my kids until my perfect < PROPFIRST > gets home . Going to study some before my quiz Sunday . Wish everyone could be as happy as me ! 
Just thought I would say bye to the Facebook world before I delete my profile . Some certain people won't leave me alone and keep finding ways to get on my < PROPFEMALE > . So like he ruins everything else , he has ruined this for me too . 
you can write you're own life but remember to use a pencil and give god the eraser 
I always thought that I would have so much to teach my child , but I find that it is my child who has taught me . 
Getting < PROPMALE > up fot school than cleaning my floors and going back to bed for a while . Zahary is out of school now and < PROPMALE > still has a wk ! I will go crazy without him here to help . They love him so much , I can get my stuff done cause they stay stuck up his butt . 
My love , my whole life . < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sanders . He has made me the happiest woman ever . I never thought love could feel so pure and wonderful . Almost eight years and I still can't stand to be away from him for even a minute . He completes me . 
Thanks for putting that pic of < PROPMALE > on my < PROPFEMALE > since you knew I wouldn't . But from his #1 fan , tht doesn't look < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . This coming from someone who never misses one game and has probably since every pic he's ever been in . Can tell by the back of his head . lol 
School is great ! Kids are amazing ! We have all 5 of them every other wk for the summer . Thank GOD for < PROPMALE > ! What a help he is & they are all so good for him . Life is so good . Thanks to < PROPFIRST > for our life . 
< PROPMALE > is gone to NC and the beach for 2 wks ! I am heartbroken ! But he won't ge gone anymore this summer !!!! Life is great . < PROPFIRST > has been off for 5 days . Havin a great wk . Back to norm tomorrow but everyday is wonderful so it's okay ! 
Just finished my first draft on a paper about my life for psychology ! That sucked . I would rather write a research paper anyday . Life is great now but there are many parts of it I would rather not think about more less share with stangers . I better get an A ! 
Just me and < PROPFIRST > chael today . < PROPMALE > is at his sperm donor's , < PROPFIRST > is at work , < PROPMALE > is going to Clemson beach with mom and boys , and < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > aren't coming this wk cause they are at friends . What are we to do ? 
Grades are already in on my essay paper and I made a 100 !!!!! That gives me a 97.4 average . I am so glad . Come on < PROPMALE > you can't let mom show you up ! LOL 
Lots of yard work today . The storm really tore it up . Trees uprooted , limbs EVERYWHERE , even took the screens off a few windows . But the kids are enjoying watching me while they play in the pool . lol Times like this I wish I had a smaller yard but thankful for a brick house ! 
I am so ill ! I just took a quiz with 10 questions and thought I aced it and I missed 1 . I believe from what the book stated both answers were really correct and the question was unfair . Believe me I e-mailed my professor and teachers assistant about this . That brought my grade to a 95 overall . Now you all see why I am so hard on < PROPMALE > , I am the same way about my own work . 
Last day and daddy's home for the wkend !!! Got 2 < PROPMALE > tests to take by Sat . though Wish me luck . Gonna have have fun Daddy's Day . He deserves only the best . Love you < PROPFIRST > ! 
I have had such a stressful day ! < PROPFIRST > needs to get home . I can't stand for people to hurt my kids feelings & there is nothing I can do about it . Looks like I'm gonna finish with a 94 or 95 . Those tests were harder than I thought and no time to study with < PROPFIRST > working late and < PROPMALE > gone . Tomorrow has to be better . 
Just a few more hrs and < PROPFIRST > will be home !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now all I need is < PROPMALE > here and I will be complete !

Had a horrible day for the first time in a long time . I have the virus that Raychael had and it is soooo painful . I don't see how she did it .

Went to baby doc today & I have gained 19 lbs .!!! In 2 wks . OMG ! I am 33 wks but measure 34 wks . They are probably going to induce @ 38 or 39 wks even though my sugar has been stable . Fixing to lay down with my perfect man and let Raylee rest as much as she can before she gets here with < PROPMALE > & Raychael , LOL !! 
good seeing you too but I am so mad about him not putting < PROPMALE > in more . < PROPMALE > might get mad but I am talking to him tomorrow @ practice . 
< PROPMALE>'s team won thier game . Should be happy but the QB they keep putting in sucks . My son is so much better and they won't give him a < PROPMALE > cause the coach has known the other QB all his life . Pretty sorry if you ask me . But I am proud of my boy . 
Life is so crazy , great one minute and lost the next . Thank GOD for my kids . Just pray that Raylee is healthy and I can handle the rest . 
Got a paper due tonight . My wonderful hubby is home today to watch our < PROPFEMALE > so I can get it done . Still pist about my Patriots yesterday . < PROPMALE > said it right when he said they just SUCKED ! WTF ! Lovin my babies and lovin my < PROPFIRST > !!

Rainy day @ home with my love and homework . Got a paper due today and have to keep my 100 average . Do it all for my famiy . 
Fixing to take my little Z man to the doctor to check out his swollen lymph node on his neck . Not hurting him or anything just concerns me . Then back to finish my paper . 
All is great in the Sanders house . Love my perfect husband and my wonderful kids . Just can't wait for our littlest one to get here !! 
< PROPMALE > has to go to a specialist . Will make the appointment tomorrow . His white blood ccell count was fine so they are gonna do a biospy and we will get the rest of his blood work back when he goes . Everybody pray that nothing serious is wrong with my baby boy . Love you < PROPMALE > !!! 
< PROPMALE > goes to the specialist at 3:00 today . Everybody say your prayers for my little man ! Mommy loves you < PROPMALE > !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This DA said to give it 2 wks , even though he found more on the other side & he would see him back . He wasn't even going to do a biopsy then like the ER said until I pitched a fit . If they can't find any reason for them then why not a least check to make sure it is the rare possibility that it could be serious ? I have lived thru the slim < PROPMALE > of something rare happening . I am not waiting for it to happen again . 
Getting pretty for labor . You always see all the wemon on TV having there babies with the hair done and make-up all perfect . I always look like hell in my hospitals pics so this time I am gonna try to look good in mine lol . Got my eyebrows waxed and getting my hair did today . Let's see if it works . 
Did all my homework today because I have been having bad pains in by stomach , back , and legs . Maybe getting ready . I am 9 months so she can come anytime . Ready for Raylee ! 
Went to the doctor today and this ones date is the 27th . That makes me 37 wks . tomorrow & she already weighs 6lbs . 13oz . I am also dialated to 2 but that doesn't mean much ., and I was a big girl and got my FLU shot . Yea for me . See you soon Raylee ! 
Still in the bed contracting . They said I could do this for 3 more weeks without dialating . This is torture . And to top it all off all the kids are home sick with fevers & < PROPFIRST>'s at work . GOD help me ! I love you < PROPFIRST > lee ! 
Fixing to head out the door to go to NC to get my cake then hurry home to set up for the shower . Hopefully this will be a good day . < PROPFIRST > is determined to make sure of it . Who else would get up @ 5:00 am to drive 3 hrs round trip for me a cake . I am so lucky to have him !!! 
Went to hospital again today . I have either a torn or pulled ligament in the right side of my belly . I am on complete bed rest because of course the baby is not going to stop moving in there and kicking it so i just have to deal until she decides to come . I love you Raylee !!! 
Took < PROPMALE > to the doctor and one of the test for cat scratch fever came back positive . They took a urine specimen and blood to test his thyriods and told me the ENT could tell me more about the results we got today . Nothing serious so far , Thank GOD . 
I have the most perfect family in the world ! My kids are amazing in every way and < PROPFIRST > is the most wonderful , loving man on the earth !! Can't wait to meet our < PROPFIRST > lee !!! 
Homecoming tonight and < PROPMALE > is waking the hopeful homecoming < PROPFEMALE > out . Also all of Zacharys blood work & urine came back fine ! 
Just got back from the hospital so they could moitor Raylee for awhile . I was checking the mail when I a huge tree branch fell out of our huge tree and hit me right in the stomach causing a 3 inch abration . Thank goodness Raylee is fine and it barely missed Raychael . It would have knocked her out . What luck I have sometimes !

She means the world to me and I don''t think she or < PROPMALE > realize how much they mean to me and how much they have influenced my life nd what I want out of it . I would love to have Raylee today to honor such a wonderful woman and mother . 
Well still pregnant and feel great ! D *** IT ! I want my baby ! Trying to plan this weekend & next for dffent trunk-or-treats and it is dort of hard when you don't know if you will be at the hospital or not .

I called today to see since I had to be @ the doctor @ 3:00 on Monday if they would induc me that night or what and they said I would be sent to the hospital the next morning . WTF ?? 
Had a wonderful day . Pumkin patch this afternoon with hayride , corn maze , zip slide , just too much to mention then fall festival at the church . Had so much fun . But for the next ones Raychael is going to be a peagent < PROPFEMALE > because she feels more comfortable that way .

Mrs. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sanders 
What a wonderful day . Bought the kids new clothes , got the boys haircut , went out to eat , and met < PROPMALE>'s dad and he said he would help me get on at the Clemson University Police after the first of the year !! Just the help I need to get my foot in the door . I will be a Special Victims Detective . Watch and see ! 
< PROPFIRST > has been off most of the week and has to work this weekend !! I have to catch up on my cleaning . Check-ups , dentist , and orthadontist stuff all this week and ready to slow down . But my babies are healthy with pretty smiles ! Love being mommy ! 
Off to bed . Kids are at < PROPFEMALE>'s and < PROPMALE > is at < PROPFIRST>'s . Of course < PROPFIRST > lee is here but < PROPMALE > just spent his 1st night away from home 3 monthes ago & < PROPFIRST > chael would not leave him tonight so she is spending her 1st night away . Can't believe I didn't get a call to come get her . I am going to go crazy after < PROPFIRST > leaves in the morning until they get here . I can't do this again . Not yet . 
Tomorrow is my anniversary & probably won't get to see < PROPFIRST > all day . Off work all this time & working 14 hrs tomorrow . WTF . Half tempted to have him call in . I need this special time with him right now ! 
Much better mood now . < PROPFIRST > is on his way home and I am watching my boys kick some Mannibg A** !! Nice interception Manning . Trying to be more like your brother ??? HAHAHAHA 
Just got my awards letter and it seems like I will be getting my $760 this week and my other $2775 just barely in time for Christmas !!!!!!! My babies are going to have a great one as usual after all !! Gonna help out < PROPFIRST>'s nephews because they never get anything and it breaks my heart . They usually don't even now it is Christmas . So sad . 
I never thought I would ever be so thankful on Thanksgiving again . This little surprise I got called Raylee , lol , has showed me just how much I have and how and how woerful my life is !! 
Happy Birthday Momma . ( Granny Net ) but I called mer Momma til Lexi was born and had to stop because Lexi started calling her Momma too . lol . Have a good one with my baby girl . I love and miss you so much ! Happy Thanksgiving ! 
This Christmas is turning out to be the best yet ! Love doing the Chistmasy things : hot chocolate , the Christmas candles burning and giving that Christmas smell , while we bake cookies and what Christmas movies ! Nothing beats it !

So much school work !! Not easy keeping all A's with 4 kids and a husbnd . lol !!! Wouldn't change a thing about it though . Love my life ! 
Shopping on-line ! The greatest thing ever . None of < PROPFIRST>'s bitching over lines or money because he has no idea what I am spending . He will just enjoy the looks on their faces on Christmas morning . They have the most amazing stuff on there that you can't get at the store's . I can't wait to see their faces ! That's my birthday present . 
Not a good day . < PROPFIRST > left me out of a very important part of hus life yesterday . The first time he puts anyone in front of me will be the last . If we do speak to each other it won't be nice today . And nobody will be seeing him for awhile unless they come here . I have a nice home and would like to be in it sometimes . 
You know what ? Today's gonna be a good day after all . My husband & I are going to take our kids snow chasing . We want to see snow and F *** everyone else . This is why we stick to ourselves . So if anyone knows where the closest snow will be today hit me up and let me know . Hope everyone has a great day !

I get my money anytime in the next 10 days ! Already have a lot bought for < PROPMALE > so they didn't sell out of his kind of stuff . This year is going to be the best . Going to pick out a child to buy for this weekend so the kids appreciate what they get . 
Another d**m VIRUS ! All I do is keep up with updates on here and school work . What is going on ??? 
Love these kids . They make life worth while . Not just as babies because they will always be our babies . I could never express the joy motherhood and being < PROPFIRST>'s wife brings to me . They are gifts not to be taken for granted . < PROPFEMALE > Christmans everyone ! 
What a wonderful life !!!!!!! 
#122 we have known each othe since I was in 3rd grade and you were a grade ahead of me and I was so worried about 4th grade and you set me at ease . I don't know why I remember that so well . We were in your room . 
#22 you are one of the best friends I have ever had . I hated losing you to jealous spouses . I really could have used your friendship in those hard years , but I have found you again .

No matter what happens we will go through it together and everything will be alright . 
EVERYTHING IS COVERED IN SNOW ! 
HUSBAND WEEK : If you have a husband who is your best friend , who works hard for you , who has been with you through thick and thin , who loves you even when you're at your worst , and whom you are PROUD to be married to , copy and paste this as your status . I love you < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Sanders ! 
\And when you smile the world stops and stares for awhile because you're amazing just the way you are ! \"" 
Sometimes I thank GOD for unanswered prayers . Remember when you're talking to the man upstairs , just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care . Some of GOD's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers ! 
Can't wait til 4:30 tomorrow . Get to watch the Pats deFEET the Jets ! Just put < PROPFEMALE > on the side lines without shoes on . Lol . We got this anyways . 
It's gonna be us against GB in the Superbowl , just watch . But today is the game I care about the , most . Gonna be dancing like Happy FEET ! 
WTF ! I AM ABOUT TO FLIP OUT ON THE TV ! THIS IS NOT THE WAY MY BOYS PLAY . DON'T THEY THROW FLAGS ON THE JETS ? 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is still the best QB in the NFL . One game doesn't define his career so keep on hating . You're jealousy just proves how great he is . So kiss his feet ! 
I have the best son in the world especially since he is always having to be let down over and over again by his \father\ " . Thank goodness he has < PROPFIRST > that NEVER let's him down . We love you < PROPMALE >!" 
I'm glad that we was nice enough this year to let another team win . We shouldn't hog all the SB 
Gonna have a good relaxing day at home with my hubby & girls . Just what I need 
Gonna have a good relaxing day at home with my hubby & girls . Just what I need .

Beer , UGH !

POOR POOR JETS ! I DON'T CARE WHO STOPPED THEM JUST AS LONG AS THEY DIDN'T GO TO THE SUPERBOWL ! 
Thinking about chainging my carrer choise . Don't have to change my < PROPMALE > . I am thinking about being a Social Worker . I see too many cases miss handled and I want to at least make a part in making the system better . It seems like they hurt more families then they help sometinmes and maybe it it because they are understaffed or whatever but I believe that is what my heart is telling me to do . 
Double kidney infection . Yay . I have a fever and I am in so much pain . Anybody need a kidney . That would cut my < PROPMALE > of recurring kidney infections in half . 
Does anyone know how much registration is for flag football @ < PROPFEMALE > rec ? Got a paper about when it starts but no $ amount . < PROPMALE > is finally getting to play but he can't get used to \no tackling\ " lol . That's < PROPMALE >!"
