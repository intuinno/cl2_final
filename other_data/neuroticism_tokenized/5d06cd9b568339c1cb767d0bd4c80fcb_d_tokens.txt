in need of a BOSS crew ! cause BOSS is suffering without < PROPMALE > 
I'm going to six flags alone 
why do I suck so much ? why do I live alone ? how do you guys even tolerate my existence ?! 
philadelphia is \cream cheese\ " in italian " 
I managed to get an interview with Six Flags 
is bored of his gourd 
I got a job at six flags ! now hopefully nothing will come up at the background check 
seriously I'm starting to doubt many things and its driving me to the point of insanity and depression 
I watched marly and me ... that kind of stuff just gets to you 
I'm scared to death that I will never be afraid 
I am happy ! We are going to see so much stuff in New York ! I'm bursting with excitement

If this primitive duality of our lives , good and evil , could be housed in seperate identities , life would be relieved of all that is unbearable . \ 
It is a curse of all of us that these polar twins should be constantly struggling . 
Lessons not learned in blood are easily forgotten .
