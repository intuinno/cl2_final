wishes finding classmates from long ago was simple . :/ 
I'm more worried about North Korea's threat of nuclear war , but I'm not /completely/ heartless . Took a moment to ponder what the afterlife has in store for him , and then went to play a bit of Moonwalker for Sega < PROPFEMALE > in his memory that I had on my lap 
Hey , everyone . I'm just letting y'all know that I should have all my photos from MetroCon 2009 and St. < PROPMALE > Pride up by tomorrow . And they suck . :( Note to self , get a camera battery some time before next MetroCon . * cries * Daaaan , you're gonna be mad at

First day of work ... pretty great . :) 
Second day of work .. we finally do work ! :D Just one transaction by the time the day ended . But you know what , it's cool . Since I get paid 14.73 /hr .. and I'm working overtime tomorrow , I get time and a half . So that's ... 14.73 *8+ 14.73 *4 , right ? Either way you slice it , that's a lot of money for a day ! Even with taxes taken out ! :D * purrs * Krys , Christ , Luke .. it's time to go decorate the evil lair . >:) 
Forgot the stipend wasn't included , but that's still good stuff regardless . MAAANNN ... paycheck is gonna be beau'i'ful when I get it .

A moment of repose ; I got my little brother the last of his birthday gifts today , helped the mere out with dog , treated them both to take-out Chinese , and got Trauma Center : Under the Knife . Glorified Operation was never so much fun ! :D And lack of fleas ! ..... * scratchscratch * 
Why are we putting a surgical intern on the job of removing blood clots in someone's spleen ? :/ It seems the future is jolly well whacked . No help with my medical assistant berating me . Dx Trauma Center , you're such a tease .

is gonna go nini to make herself some lil ' big donuts by cleaning , ushering , and will try to visit a friend of hers ' ; wonders if she'll be seeing that roach in the morning again , and if so , she'll name it Bosco or something , as it sounds like a sitcom better than all those damned HSM movies put together . 
is actually rather pissed she has to work this morning when she was told otherwise ; her feet haven't recovered from working on her feet 8 hours and less than 3 hours of sleep . :/ Really wanted this day to herself so she could scare some people ... and do some stuff for Samhain .

A so-called soldier named < PROPFIRST > Simms currently serving in Iraq is saying that soldiers are not heroes ( college kids are ) , and has created a group to voice this . Am I the only one who finds this odd ? Much less , the grammar which he spews ? Even children with crayon can do better . * facepalm * :( His defending the First Amendment confuses me to no end .

Doood . A friend of my show't this to me . It's behemoth in weight and cost , but lap-friendly n ' very maluable . Every key can be customized , though I'm pretty sure some of you would prefer the feel of a real ' < PROPFEMALE > . But think of an instrument you probably can't get very easily . You could probably find the vocal range and download it all on this keyboard . :P Interesting . http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Axiom25.html

Maaaaaaannnnn ... everytime I hear my Dad reminesce and feel sad that Portal was taken off of G4's airwaves , it breaks my heart . :( He really did like G4 back in the day . \ 
But now that he has a plain ' ol ' Playstation and games , I can try to convert him to the ways of Final Fantasy 9 . >:D 
I helped a cousin of mine in with a project for his school . We got the news today that my writing for him actually made its way into the school paper . Mind you , this is an elementary school in Illinois that a Floridian did . Now he wants to come down for the fair and eat chocolate-covered bacon :D What a cool thing to find out , and a good way to crown Mother's Day . If only I saved it .. ah , well . \

On one hand , I hate < PROPFEMALE > Pitstop . But then I see her family was a bigger idiot to trust them to a villain who couldn't even secure his riches .

It's 7'20 . No call yet . Back to phase one .. n.n

hopes to get that job she put in for at the TBPAC so she can possibly watch < PROPFIRST > Poppins on stage since she's never seen it before . EVER . 
To Herr Honorable Spider : Can we have a talk over some parfait ? I hate walking into your living room and kitchen at 5am walking my dog and carrying a stick after you rebuild it , so could you move it where it's not in a common walkway ? It doesn't help that I still get owned in the face in my wishes to avoid it . :( Thanks for not bitting me or using my hair as a lair . \

Went to Lithia Springs for a bit , and had a sizable school of tilapia swim around me . Now , people feed the tilapia , but I had my hands exposed showing I had no food . And they kept following me wherever I went ; had no bad < PROPMALE > either . I sat down for 30 minutes and they never really left me alone .

Drove in open road with traffic for the first time at roughly early morning with the Mere's car , and I've found myself to be a much more competent driver than I thought I was . :/ When I make mistakes , she gets nervous , and then I get nervous with her corrections . Once I chill out , I'm perfectly fine . My brain hasn't learned not to think so hard when driving--can't help it , as there's so much to think about .
