Children are like wet cement . Whatever falls on them makes an impression . \ 
\ 
Children will not remember you for the material things you provided but for the feeling that you cherished them . \ 
The child must know that he is a miracle , that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been , and until the end of the world there will not be , another child like him . 
Help a man when he is down and he will remember you the next time he is down .

I found an envelope outside my train station with a letter and $2 inside . The letter reads , “Loose Change the World – This money was left here specifically for your use .

In any case , I hope it “changes” your day for the better . ” WIN and IMMD .

They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and\ 
never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they\ 
just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway\ 
they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is\ 
... busy but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if ... you have at least 1 of\ 
these friends . You know who you are ! 
When the tone goes off at 1:00 am , or any time , a volunteer firefighte r/EMT/ FR or rescue person is startled awake , jumps out of bed , gets dressed , and is en-route to the station . Regardless of the hour , weather conditions , holiday or event -when needed , they promptly respond . Put this as your status for awhile if you are an emergency responder , or if you know any one of the above or you support your local heroes ! 
If the object of your faith is a particular outcome for your situation , your faith will be as weak as your wisdom . But if the source and object of your faith is Almighty God , even if it is the weak mustard-seed variety , your faith will be enough for whatever God allows into your life .
