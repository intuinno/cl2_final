Ive come to the conclusion that I like books that are based off of video games and movies . I also like books of which video games and movies are based off of . I think that by reading it instead of watching it I can be more drawn into that universe thus enjoying it more . 
Besides the obvious friends , family , loved ones , what are you thankful for ? \ 
I'm thankful for the Internet , Webcomics , and of course Bacon . 
Silverpines , \ 
you have way to many packs of balverines wondering around . I killed 40\ 
of them in 15 minutes . I was afraid there wouldn't be a human alive \ 
when i walked into your village . 
\Change\
