One needs to work to make a living , and one needs to live so they can continue working ... How tragically interesting . ( Sigh ) 

Every moment is the last moment of this moment , thus we induce that this moment precedes that moment , which sets precedent for all following moments , and before you know it , you are no longer sure if you exist at all in the moment , for by the time you pro 
It is easy to write of a simpler world when sitting by Walden Pond , but for those of us who must hold down a real job , thoughts of world peace are far from our minds . All we care about is just being done with our day . To finish this email , write the propo

Today was a long day , ripe with cynicism ... Some might say that doubts are what refine a thought , but I wonder as to the true worth of a skeptic's eye ... Do things happen to us for a reason ? Or is it all a product of circumstance ? 
\She believed in nothing ; only her skepticism kept her from becoming an atheist . \ " -Jean-Paul Sartre "

Things never go the way we plan ; no matter how hard we insist on having it our own way . Sometimes this is for the better , and sometimes the worse ... Either way it is what it is , and all we can do is appreciate the little joys when they come , and feel no regret when they are gone . Fall teaches us this simple lesson , a humbling truth that we all are mortal , living season by season , yet there is joy in shuffling leaves . 
Words have more power than most give credit , for one right word can save face , situation , or soul , and the wrong can leave a moment hollow , sorrowful , or angry ... You can also never truly take them back either , no matter how much you may like to , and hence we must forever walk the balance between the sincerity of moment and the strategy of the future . Which is better ? That is perspective based ... 
Today is Monday . Though on the surface today appears much the same as many other Mondays , today is different because it is NOT those other Mondays , and I am NOT the person I was one week ago , let alone two ... None of us are actually , for since our personality is but the outward demonstration of our reaction to these forever changing actions , we forever change ourselves ... 
Perhaps there are indeed an infinite number of universes , and in each universe you are someone completely different than in this ... Perhaps the cosmos is but the playing field of statistics , and your reality the magic square landed on by God's roulette wheel . What if with every decision we forever divide ourselves between two realities , an incalculable continuum of divisions ? Shadows one and all ...

The poet < PROPFIRST > Frost once wrote of a November guest who loved the clouded sky and frozen earth , seeing them both as beautiful ... I must confess a similar praise of Autumn . I too love to see the grass and fallen leaves so intricately criss crossed with white frost , and I truly enjoy the stillness that only an Autumn morning knows . God doesn't need to shout to be heard on an Autumn morning , but only has to whisper ...
