Nickleback ~ Just to get high is a great song 
If you feel so empty\ 
So used up , so let down\ 
If you feel so angry\ 
So ripped off so stepped on\ 
You're not the only one\ 
Refusing to back down\ 
So get up 
So come sunday I will officially be a member of a church . 
< PROPFEMALE > why are you calling me so late ? \ 
It's kinda hard to talk right now\ 
< PROPFEMALE > why are you crying , is everything okay ? \ 
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud\ 
\ 
Well , my girl's in the next room\ 
Sometimes I wish she was you\ 
I guess we never really moved on\ 
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name\ 
It sounds so sweet\ 
Coming from the lips of an angel\ 
Hearing those words it makes me weak 
I found God on the corner of 1st and Amistad\ 
Where the West was all but won\ 
All alone , smoking his last cigarette\ 
I said , \Where you been ? \ " He said 
I\ 
am an UN-APOLOGETIC AMERICAN ! I pledge allegiance to the flag of the \ 
United States of < PROPFEMALE > , & to the REPUBLIC for which it stands , one\ 
nationUNDER GOD , indivisible , with < PROPFEMALE > & JUSTICE for all ! I \ 
grew up reciting this every morning in school . It is a shame we no \ 
longer do ...... that ... for fear of OFFENDING SOMEONE ! .... Let's see how \ 
many < PROPFEMALE > ns will re-post this & not care about offending 
ou know there's a dirty word\ 
Never gonna say it first\ 
No , it's just a thought\ 
That never crosses my mind\ 
Maybe in the parking lot\ 
Better bring your friend along\ 
Better rock together\ 
Than just one at a time\ 
S is for the simplety\ 
E is for the ecstasy\ 
X is just to < PROPFIRST > the spot\ 
' Cause that's the one you really want 
OUR SKY IS FALLING <- AWESOME BAND LOOK THEM UP ! 
Well time for work hope it doesnt ruin the good day ive been having . Be back around 12-1am 
Sitting at panera enjoying a meal

Is working with a friend to come up with the tattoo he is getting when he turns 18 ..... Getting there =D 
Has figured out everything but the font style of the words on his tat now to save up the 500-1000 dollars its probably going to cost to get it 
BEWARE I have seen EVERY CSI , Murder he Wrote and Criminal Minds episode in EXISTENCE . I could make it look like < PROPMALE > the Chipmunk killed you 
... Has reached the point where he just doesn't give a fuck anymore ! 
Hurt me , fine . Hurt my family , and you had better run like your life depends on it because it probably does . Note : Family doesn't stop with blood . 
OK , OK . I think I've got it now ? Your aloud to treat me like crap , but when i do it too you . Its hell let loose ! Yeah sure one rule for me , and another for you ! 
I talk a lot , so when I'm quiet ... you should worry 
Two packs of cigarettes a day\ 
The strongest whiskey\ 
Kentucky can make\ 
That's a recipe to put a vagabond\ 
On his hands and knees\ 
I watched it all up close , \ 
I knew him more than most\ 
I saw a side of him he never showed\ 
Full of sympathy for a world that\ 
Wouldn't let him be 
If everyone cared and nobody cried\ 
If everyone loved and nobody lied\ 
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride\ 
Then we'd see the day when nobody died 
ugh i hate being sick especially since im broke as hell and actually need to work tonight >.< 
think you can do much better than me\ 
After all the lies that I made you believe\ 
Guilt kicks in and I start to see\ 
The edge of the bed\ 
Where your nightgown used to be\ 
I told myself I won't miss you\ 
But I remember\ 
What it feels like beside you\ 
I really miss your hair in my face\ 
And the way your innocence tastes\ 
And I think you should know this\ 
You deserve much better than me 
<- Is really enjoying Hinder recently
