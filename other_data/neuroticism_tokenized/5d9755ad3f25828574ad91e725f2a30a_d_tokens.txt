Life is too short to wake up with regrets . Love the people who treat you right , and forget the ones who don't . Believe that eveything happens for a reason . If you get a < PROPMALE > , take it . If it changes your life , let it . Nobody said life would be easy , they just promised it would be worth it . 
It takes a minute to have a crush on someone , and hour to like someone , and a day to love someone , but it takes a lifetime to forget someone . 
The only thing worse than a broken heart is knowing that you'd do it all over again just for him 
is finally back from colorado !!! 
Beginnings are usually scary , and endings and usually sad . But its everything in between that makes it all worth living . 
You never leave someone behind , you take part of them with you and leave a part of yourself behind . 
Today i caught myself smiling for no reason , but then i realized i was only thinking of you . 
\A kiss is just a kiss until you find the one you love . A hug is just a hug until its the one you're thinking of . A dream is just a dream until you make it come true . Love is just a word until it's proven to you . \""
