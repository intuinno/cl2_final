im the invisible man\ 
incredible how you can\ 
see right through me\ 
its criminal how i can\ 
see right through you 
i would just like to point out that the thing that makes us bad is not only our personality but how we see others \ 
stereotypical views towards people , hating someone based on how they dress or look , or maybe hating someone because other people do\ 
your negative view on them causes you to act negatively towards them and in result they hate you so ITS ONE BIG CIRCLE OF HATE 
sometimes we may not know those who pass\ 
but either way its too bad\ 
just because they are not in your class\ 
does not mean you shouldnt be sad 
:'( im sick 
honestly i was looking foreward to skool today but noooooo stupid weather 
BEHOLD MY INVISIBLE MACHINE\ 
i cant its invisible\ 
SILENCE !!!
