I went to see SkyHi & Montezuma Fire Machine tonight . \ 
Unfortunately , I missed the post , as I'm still new to this , but I could\ 
have made sure Oli had a ride home . I had to leave very early , really\ 
it was a blip , but I had a great , though truncated time . Ran into some\ 
old friends and aquaintances , hope they keep in touch ... 

Met some interesting new people as well , and hope I wasn't creepy or something ( see personality quiz and attached rant . ) I've never seen Montezuma Fire Machine , so I'm really glad I caught them before we head out . I am quite dissapointed that I missed SkyHi , though ... but what can you do ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Zelenik's Congressional Power-play with this Mosque ( non)-issue in the ' Boro is one of several things on my mind at present . 
There are , obviously , many other issues at play . There always will be , \ 
and this does/will involve us all , as actions taken now are being\ 
analyzed by all candidates and their respective parties : occupation , \ 
language , faith , sexual orientation , skin color , etc . in order to find\ 
a nice selling point ( see Arizona’s recent immigration debacle ) for\ 
their ‘target market’ . 
Soon I won't BE here to vote in TN , but I\ 
encourage everyone to educate\ 
themselves first off and then vote/discuss/protest/act . Put simply , \ 
make a difference . ANY difference . Please go check out the monkeys\ 
we're trying to put into Congress and what they're up to . All of them . \ 
Don’t be apathetic . 
We , as humans , have a brilliant capacity for\ 
finding weaknesses in ourselves , and twice over at utilizing these\ 
weaknesses against others . 
So < PROPFEMALE > made up her very own drinking game last night ... solitaire , i think it was . Seems like i've played before , can't remember . 
Oli and I made it up to Mentor , Ohio today . One more 12-ish hour driving day tomorrow . The cats are NOT amused . 
NY SUCKS ! What a pain in the ass . You think there are rednecks in the south ? Get a load of Northern NY . Wow . We drove forever trying to find a place to piss , but since we're ' not from these here parts ' , we weren't allowed . Anyway , we made it late Sunday in time to catch an amazing sunset over Lake Champlain , looking out toward New York and Quebec . Awesome . 
Got a new phone , lost all my contact < PROPFIRST > , though . Hit me up with those sweet digits ! (#' S , guys ) . 
Getting a F¶-ton of sleet here , winter is quite inpatient . 
Longing for longjohns 
If i don't die in the next few hours , i'll never be loved by the fans !! 28 , tricks ! 
Thanks for the b-day wishes , all ! I was moving into my first vermonty apt . that day , < PROPFEMALE > and I just celebrated last night ... Skinny Pancake and < PROPMALE > Potter , brilliant ! 
Check out Kontrolled Demolition , especially if you're from MJ . 
Fuck some emo , but you know its one of those days when the playlist goes Pantera , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , Operation < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Apple , Rammstein , < PROPMALE > Smith , etc . what a back and forth ! pick an emotion already . 
23 degrees in the islands this morning - the sun took a day off , I think . Supposed to get down to 8 by Thurs . night . Can't wait to go ice-fishing . 
I love snow ! 
Daily Scorpio Horoscope\ 
\ 
Scorpio , you ARE Hell . Eat your pain and your sorrow , there is no love left in the past . Rebuild the bridges you've destroyed and continue onward . Today you will dine on the marrow of the ground beneath your feet . Oh , and buy her flowers . 
Why do I have to be so empathetic ? I can't stand to see anyone I love in pain , yet , logically , there is no avoiding it . Death , relocation , loss of jobs , divorce ... this is real life . So why can't it be as easy as it seems for most ? 
Lake-side my ass ! Lake-On ! there is little cooler than splitting a beer with a friend in the middle of a frozen lake . By years end I hope to trek to the point where I'm in Vermont , New York , and Quebec all at the same time . Okay , I'm easily amused , so ? 
26 You were always an amazing friend , and still are after this much time has passed . I forget about some of the details from that time , thanks for the reminders . It was rare that I found a guy friend worth being around , so hanging out with girls and their make-up was special ! lol . That was an awesome time , until E & N anyway , but I always had you and P . Thank you for years of kind words and the thought behind them . 
A < PROPFEMALE > 0 degrees in VT this morning . No worries , though ... it feels -10 . Hope everyone had a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
is gonna be a daddy ! but first , he might be sick .
