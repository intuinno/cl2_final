< PROPFEMALE > loves playing < PROPFIRST > on the Wii . I used to , but it just makes me nervous these days . 

Took < PROPFEMALE > shopping for her birthday today . Bought virtually nothing ! Lots of walking and looking though . 
Living with a dog takes all your dignity away ! 
I just made the best pancakes ever ! I love a good pancake . 
Back to work today after a couple weeks off . Ug ! I suppose I should be grateful that no one , it seems , can get stuff done without me around . Maybe that equates to job security . 
It's our anniversary today . 31 years of married bliss ! 
Decided to tone our anniversary celebration down and only went out to eat last night at the Sizzler to celebrate . It made us both sick ! 
It's so nice to have the sun shine again ! 
I'm going fishing to the Owyhee river tomorrow afternoon . Any takers to go with me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > left for South < PROPFEMALE > this morning . Will be gone until Friday . Who would have guessed that a part time job would turn into this . 
After 12 hours and 3 flight changes < PROPFEMALE > finally made it . Storms caused a delay in landing at < PROPFEMALE > Beach and they had to fly out over the Atlantic in turbulent weather . < PROPFEMALE > felt like kissing the ground when they finally landed . 
Having a reallly nice SNOW BLIZZARD right now . It would be pretty if it wasn't MAY ! 
Just got in big trouble with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > for dumping out the stinkiest Sensi wax made ! They say it's exotic , I say it's notious . 
Worked in McCall with < PROPFEMALE > helping me on Saturday , had to go back on Monday , back on Tuesday , and again this coming Friday . That road is getting mighty boring ! 
I'm a bachelor again this week ! Second time this month . Life is not so good right now ! 
I've been working in McCall the last 2 days . I've been rained on , snowed on , hailed on and blown to bits ! 
I'm starting to run out of places to pile snow !
