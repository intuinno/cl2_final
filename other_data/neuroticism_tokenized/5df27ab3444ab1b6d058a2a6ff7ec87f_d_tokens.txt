ajkdhsajkhd ... Prostitution is NOT the PROBLEM !!! Stupid , ridiculous , petty old men and their condemnation of women , while the men themselves are the reason why such a profession has even ever existed in the first place ! gar - I'm glad I picked such a lively topic . 
ahhh , thesis has become 36 pages ... without footnotes ;) SOOO happy to have the bulk of the work done :D 
researching pro-life views on abortion makes me feel like less of a human being ... it makes me feel that , in their eyes , I should not use my brain because it will ultimately be of no use . As if being a woman is only secondary to what I am biologically capable of producing ... :[ Depressing to think that people who don't even know me have already categorized how they feel my life should play out . 
less than 16 hours away and on the 4th floor of the library -- I don't know if I'm shaking because I'm so nervous or just freezing cold ??

Anyone want to make about 100 footnotes for me and reformat my thesis ?? Pleeaase :} -- And then anyone else want to do 6 summaries for themes from women's history , cuz that would be GREAT !

I'm in the AIFS Study Abroad catalog for Russia TWICE !!! Check it out - St. Petersburg Fall 2011 & Spring 2012 -- https://webapps3.aifs.com/college/Common/Catalogs.aspx 
thinking of building a speech around Lenin and Gandhi and MLK ;) aren't you excited to hear it ? 
you know those moments when life seems just so incredibly amazing and you are so extremely grateful for everything you've gone through , for all the ideas you've been exposed to , and most of all for the people who've taught you more about yourself than you thought you may ever know -- this is one of those moments . 
just realized that on the walls of my room , there are 4 maps , 2 calendars , and only photos/art of places I have never seen in reality . Isn't that interesting !? 
ahhh - I want to hear some RUSSIAN !! It's been too long :\\ ... or some other Slavic language that I can try to decipher :]
