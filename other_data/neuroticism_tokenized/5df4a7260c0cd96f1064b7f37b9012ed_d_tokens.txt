I started building a stone wall this morning . Feeling very sturdy . 

Dear Y'all , Responses ( and letters to the Powers That Be ) were fast , furious , and fierce . They did a great job of letting the PTB know that there are folks out there who care and are paying attention . That's about all that anyone can do at this point , and now Dr. Fox needs us to dial it back and be quiet while he goes about the work of trying to fix this mess the PTB have created . Thanks , < PROPFIRST > 
BTW , for the few remaining humans on the planet I have yet to tell , we are going to be grandparents in February . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > are going to be remarkable parents , and the baby doesn't have a single solitary < PROPMALE > of growing up normal , which is wonderful . 
If you like animation or are at all < PROPFEMALE > or just like gorgeous movies , netflix yourselves a copy of \The Secret of Kells\ " ASAP . " 
Our staggeringly beautiful grandson entered the world this morning shortly after 7:30 . He doesn't have a name yet , because they're waiting for him to open his eyes and let them know whether he's < PROPMALE > or < PROPFIRST > , but he was very contentedly nursing when we left and his parents were exhausted , but ecstatic . 
Pix as soon as I have them . 
His name is < PROPMALE > .

I'd like to start a campaign in response to < PROPFEMALE > O'Donnell's new ad where she claims \I am you . \ " So here's the challenge : How many ways is she not you ? Let's send her a long list . \ 
Does anyone have the url for that video of great signs from counter-protests at anti-gay rallies ? I've lost it and need to relocate it . 
I used to respect < PROPMALE > Dupont . I can only assume that he's gone senile . Sheesh .

Just read that Denmark has the highest tax rate in the world -- 48.7% . Interesting that they are also the happiest people in the world ...
