Spent a 25 minute convo on the phone , listening \ 
to my friend type out things about her . INVIGORATING . Lmao jk . It was amusing . 
Lately , I have been feeling a little depressed about moving to Texas . I would leave my best friend and her family , which essentially became my own . But as I think about it , God must have something in store for me if he takes me from the people I love and throws me head first into situations I am once again ill-prepared for . I find I can cry about this , I can suffer , but I figure I will just stand tall . 
* Insert something deep and life changing . * 
I waited hours for my friend to call and she goes to sleep . =/ How depressing .

What's worse ? Finding out the person you care about the most only cares about themselves or that they could careless how you feel . 
I saw a < PROPFEMALE > once , it tried to eat me . No joke . 
Love is like a friendship caught on fire . In the beginning a flame , very pretty , \ 
often hot and fierce , but still only light and flickering . As love \ 
grows older , our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals , \ 
deep-burning and unquenchable .
