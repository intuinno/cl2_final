Dragons are nearly unstoppableand , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of peoplewon't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten bydragons . ... The other 7% of people are sitting in the shower armed withfire extinguishers .

1998 – The untested < PROPFEMALE > is activated for the first time as one of the planned activities on Aperture’s first annual bring-your-daughter-to-work day . In many ways , the initial test goes well : Within one picosecond of being switched on , GLaDOS becomes self-aware . 
ethics ... so boring it took me three tries to spell it correctly ... although there is probably something mentioned in ethics classes about being on facebook updating your status while in said class ...
