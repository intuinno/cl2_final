Everything's in place , so much better for today . A < PROPMALE > , in my own mind . 

I'm giving a presentation on Cherenkov Radiation today . Fuckin eh . 
Hold your breath , it gets better .

Please put this as your status if someone \ 
related to you , or that you know was one of the hundreds of thousands of\ 
law abiding citizens murdered by the Rebel Alliance in the destruction \ 
of the Death < PROPFEMALE > . We citizens are proud of our government and our \

All I know is there's two theories to arguing with women . And neither one work . 
On one hand , we'll never expierience childbirth . On the other , we can open all out own jars . - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Once upon a time there was a boy . He was a christian and went to church everyday . Then the world ended and he died . The end . 
Awesome 
Thinking about starting to wear kilts . They look comfortable . 
Curious . Should I go buy something ? Then again , money is easier to hide than stuff ... 
Make me a list of the things you don't know , and I'll try to find someone to teach you . 
Pretty sure I win the award for most diverse Ipod . I've got Dvorak and Beethoven too . 
Ever just sat and watched the stars ? I did , 3 hours went by like nothing . Just thinking about distances , and gazing back though time . It's quite humbling , if you ask me . 
How about the power to kill a moose from 200 yards away ? With MIND BULLETS ! That's telekinesis , < PROPFIRST > . How about the power ... to move you ? 
Ok . Because < PROPFIRST > is scared his mommy will see all his dirty dirty insults , they've been deleted . Should have kept your mouth shut in the first place ! 
\When one person suffers from a delusion\ 
Just got back from NM Tech . A whole day of nonsense . I got maybe half an hours worth of work done , and it took 6 and a half hours . 
So now my tale is told\ 
Big and bad and twice as bold\ 
\ 
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow\ 
There is no easy way\ 
For an honest man today\ 
Which is something you should think of as my life boat sails away 
Whew . Exhaused . I hate exercise . Though it is strangely addicting ... 
My brother better not be a fat lard when I get back ... 
An awesome wailing was heard throughout heaven , as the\ 
terrible hand of the Lord struck upon the Earth . And as almighty God \ 
created you ... now , he calleth you home !! * click * Oops . Busy signal . Guess he'll have to calleth back ! 
Bück dich , das Gesicht interessiert mich nicht . 
Damn . I need to grow a pair . 
Fuck it . Obligatory sappy song quote . \ 
\If I was a < PROPMALE > I would give away my kingdom\ 
Gotta love friends who are there to bail you out . If I had gone through with my original plan , I'd be knocked out in the middle of the desert . 
If you're gonna die , die with your boots on . 
Sometimes I want to copy someone else's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
Screw computer science , I'm gonna be a locksmith . I can probably do the door trick with my eyes closed . 
So , besides the two who I already get to < PROPFEMALE > out with over Labor Day weekend , anyone else want to ? 
Trying to work out whether or not these are emo lyrics . \ 
\You'll receive what you give 
Toy Story 3 ? Pretty badass . 
Trig homework finished . I hate easy math ... It's no fun :( 
Interesting . 
You know you're going to a tech school when you're having Rubik's cube competitions on a Saturday night ... 
I would like to declare my profile picture the best on facebook . < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > have pretty good ones , but mine is < PROPMALE > .

Please\ 
put this on your status if you know , or are related to , someone killed \ 
on the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that \ 
the Rebel Alliance is a band of murdering scum . The Empire wants only to\ 
bring peace to the galaxy , but these rebels continue to kill our brave \ 
brothers in white ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will YOU make this \ 
your status !? 
< PROPMALE > + Warriors Helm + Hyper Boots + Valkyrie Mail + Riot Gloves + < PROPFIRST > Blade = ANNIHILATION 
I think I just need to line up everyone's mothers , and punch them in the face . Like dominoes , but more violent . And satisfying .

The Greatest Show on Earth by < PROPFIRST > Dawkins . \ 
Everyone should read this book . Specifically , you people who believe in a creation story . Nobody cares whether or not it's Navajo , Hindi , Catholic , Egyptian , whatever . After reading this book , there is no other classification for your beliefs other than \moronic \"."

I always get nervous , when you're talking to someone and they post a status update . Is it about me I wonder . There's not really a way to ask if it is so , so I just sit there , wondering . \ 
I hate wondering . 
Oh dear . I like how I'm staying up on the night before I have class at 8:00 in the morning , but don't when I don't have to get up before 12 . 
Found out today people just can't keep shit to themselves . Myself included , but not anymore . 
I wanna talk to you , but I hate feeling like I bug you . 
Anybody want a peanut ? Yahoo ! Found a new outlet . 
Pauly Shore is tonight instead of Saturday like I thought . Lesson of the day : Pay more goddamned attention . 
Oh goddamnit ... \ 
Like my status and I'll:1 . tell you something I've learned about you bylooking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . tell you the color you remind me of .... 3 . tell you my first memory of you . 4 . tell you the animal you remind me of . 5 . ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 . tell you my favorite thing about you . 7 . give you a weird nickname . 8 . challenge you to post this 
Great night tonight :D Made better by seeing someone I hadn't in a couple months . Maybe I'm too happy about it though . Oh well , that's problems for tomorrow . 
I feel better . I'm glad we're friends . 
CSE 101 . Also known as < PROPFEMALE > Sun . 
:D 
I'd like to announce that < PROPMALE > Riordan is the new < PROPMALE > of awkward questions . 
It's an interesting feeling , not being able to learn something . On another note ... Tuesday and Thursday are my new favorite days of the week . If I could , my week would consist of a loop of Tuesday , Thursday . Forever . Or at least until the semester is over . 
Anyone know a < PROPFIRST > Kennedy ? They went to Southwest Learning Center . SSLC . Message me if you do . 
What the fucking fuck ? Who the fuck fucked this fucking ... how did you two fucking fucks ... FUCK !!! 
How many noons are there ? 
Your < PROPMALE > is so small , sharpshooters in the Olympics use it as target practice . - < PROPFIRST > 
< PROPMALE > is crazy . 
< PROPFIRST > is gay . 
gay as in happy 
Not really 
Someone special just put me in an excellent mood :D 
The maximum level of loserness is pausing smash and trying to get an upskirt shot of Peach . Way to go < PROPFIRST > . You are a loser . 
So glad I'm a light sleeper . 
Wake up , wake up please . :( 
Back in < PROPFEMALE > . I need a car , damn it . 
Days left in order of importance . Cryptic , eh ? \

Besides tonight being boring , today was very good . Uh oh ... Facebook is turning into Twitter . FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU 
\Double pointer all the way across the screen ! \ " - < PROPMALE > Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan " 
I've gotta say , doing stuff for people is a pretty good feeling . Especially when you get one of those texts with nothing but a smiley face . :) 
Updating stuff ... \ 
Today\

Suddenly , today got much better because of one person . You know who you are . I also remember sitting on the floor because we didn't like the music . :) 
So < PROPMALE > has just informed me that Gamestop was selling < PROPFEMALE > Sun early . WHAT THE FUCK !! AHHHHH 
Support the cause . Change your profile picture to your favorite animated movie or cartoon character and tell your friends to do the same . The purpose ? We won't see a human picture on facebook but an invasion of childhood memories , and for the fight against childhood violence . 
This just in . Apparently , I'm a homo because I only think three out of Maxim's top 100 list are attractive . 
The solution to illegal immigration is to have them all build a wall , but make sure they are on the other side when they finish . 
Wooo ! < PROPFEMALE > Sun came in the mail today . Time to do absolutely no studying at all . 
Whoops :( 
69 : We met about 4 years ago at Hummingbird along with two other girls who liked me . Out of those 3 , I liked two . You and another girl . Long story short , you're pretty much one of my best friends ever . It's not easy being the guy everyone comes to with their problems and you help me shoulder some of that burden . I appreciate it . Thank you very much for just being you :) 
Just beat < PROPFEMALE > Sun 3 with no Djinn . Suck on that , Camelot Studios . It was a pain in the ass though , finally a challenge in this game . Lowest level was 81 , highest was 99 , and it took exactly 30:00 hours . 
If you make me second , be consistent please . 
I love cheesecake . 
Ever had one of those dreams that you're so sure is a dream , and then you wake up and find out it wasn't ? 
\What good do you think you do ? Do you think I'll be different when you're through ? \ 
The best way to keep your headphones from tying themselves in a knot is to beat them to it . 
Bah ! Ballroom Dancing has been cancelled . Probably just ruined my semester . 
Well , that was a mistake . Sorry . 
Well , I'm still bummed Ballroom Dance was cancelled , but Swing Dance hasn't been . Quite the less-than-average compromise , but whatever . Better than nothing , right ? \ 
Also , shut up < PROPFIRST > . 
Oh ? Cracker < PROPMALE > is in my Karate class ? Gonna be fun >:] 
Haven't done that in four years . Feels pretty good , even though I'm < PROPFIRST > . I'm probably getting myself into the exact same situation again , but I don't care . Right now , I feel like the happiest guy ever . 
I'm incredibly tired , but can't go to sleep . And I just figured out why ... \ 
I'm addicted to talking with you . 
OHSHI- 
hates it when I don't know whether a status update is about me or not , and can't decide which would be better . 
IT IS SNOWING MORE 
WOOO Two hour delay tomorrow ! Wait , what does that even mean ? My 8:00 classes are at 10 ? Or does it mean they arbitrarily cut off classes before a certain time ? I do not know ... 
Just thought I would reinforce this point . \ 
TWO HOUR DELAY TOMORROW 
Thanks < PROPFEMALE > , now I miss my dogs .

There is no school tomorrow .

You remind me of someone very special . In all the good ways , and the bad . Except for the most important part , the part about feeling the same way about me . 
And we'll just glide , starry eyed ... 
This just in , < PROPFIRST > Beiber on The Daily Show . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > = FAIL 
Trebek : Titles , Mr. Connery . Not titties . \ 
Connery : Not a fan of the ladies , are you Trebek ? 
Pictionary at 3:00 AM . Holy wow , it was awesome . 
Whoa ... Deja-vu . 
Don't you hate that feeling when you miss someone on Facebook by an hour ? 
Come fly with me , lets fly , lets fly away ... 
Four weeks until spring break ? That's like ... 28 days . Twenty-eight days is a long time . I don't want to wait that long . 
Just a couple more months and I'll be rid of this nonsense . 
Hey ! Hey listen ! < PROPFEMALE > Austria is a super cheerleader . But not like a regular normal cheerleader , a dancer who dances at sporting events . For the team of her school . She's different from a cheerleader , see , because super cheerleaders are \dancers who dont do annoying cheers lol\ " \ 
I love Swedish Fish . 
Wow ... you got really pretty when I wasn't looking . Holy crap .

Alright , so my brother gets off the treadmill(good for him right ? ) then he dumps a big glass of water on his head over our floor . He says \I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that ! \ " when his mother yells at him for it . \

Down an unknown road\ 
To embrace my fate\ 
Though that road may wander\ 
It will lead me to you\ 
And a thousand years\ 
Would be worth the wait\ 
It might take a lifetime\ 
But somehow I'll see it through\ 
And I won't look back\ 
I can go the distance\ 
And I'll stay on track\ 
No I won't accept defeat

What am I missing ? 
One other year has left my life , one year bygone so soon . These were the days I sacrificed , these days were lived for you . Some came with winter in white ... some days were blown away . Some came with sultry summer nights , some with October rain . \ 
Oh , how I long for utter silence , but who am I to know when rain will turn to snow ? \ 
If life brings another day ...
