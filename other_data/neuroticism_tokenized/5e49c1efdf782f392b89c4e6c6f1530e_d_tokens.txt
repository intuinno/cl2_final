It's daughters week !!! If you have one daughther or more who makes your life interesting and fun , and are a bleesing in our life and make your life worth living , copy and paste this to your status . The world would not be the same without our beautiful girls ! I love you , MAKAYLA < PROPFEMALE > AND NEVAEH !!!

And in the end it's not the years in your life that count , but the LIFE in your years . 
Did I mention beauty is in the eye of the beholder ? ? €œYou don’t love a woman because she is beautiful , but she is beautiful because you love her ? € IS THIS TRUE ? 
Today I caught myself smiling for no reason ... then I realized I was thinking about you 
life isn't always easy , it's full of tough decisions and heartache , and things don't always work out the way we hoped . life just doesn't come with guarantees . and while it's true that sometimes , by avoiding taking a < PROPMALE > on people , we can avoid some heartache , we might also miss out on the best times of our life . don't be afraid to love . 
Nobody said that it'd be easy they just promised it'd be worth it . 
Life is too precious to worry about stupid things . So have fun , get drunk , and fall in love . Say what you feel and do what you want to do . Regret nothing and don't let people who don't matter Bring You Down 
The hottest love has the coldest end . ~ Socrates 
Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile 
Some people come into our lives and quickly go . Others stay awhile , make footprints on our hearts and we are never , ever the same 
“To love is to risk not being loved in return . To hope is to risk pain . To try is to risk failure , but risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing . ” 
In the end , it's not going to matter how many breaths you took , but how many moments took your breath away 
\The only unnatural sex act is that which you cannot perform . \ " .... is that 100% true ya reckon' ? " 
Love is friendship caught on fire . 
And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation . 
When a man steals your wife , there is no better revenge than to let him keep her . 
Life is about trusting our feelings and taking chances , losing and finding happiness , appreciating memories and learning from the past 
BITCHY ? Sorry I wasnt taught to say FUCK YOU politely ! 
You can spend minutes , hours , days , weeks , or even months over analyzing a situation , trying to put the pieces together , justifying what could've would've happened - or you can just leave the pieces on the floor and MOVE THE FUCK ON ! -Tupac 
promises mean everything but once there broken sorry means NOTHING 
I believe everything happens for a reason People change so you can learn to let go Things go wrong so you can learn to appreciate them when they're right You believe lies so that eventually you learn to trust no one but yourself And sometimes good things fall apart so that better things can fall together - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
A person that never made a mistake never tried anything new ! 
\When I first saw you I was afraid to talk to you . When I first talked to you I was afraid to like you . When i first liked you i was afarid to love you . Now that I love you I m afraid to lose you \"" 
\If I reach for your hand will you hold it ?? If I hold out my arms will you hug me ?? If I go for your lips will you kiss me ?? If I capture your heart will you love me ? \"" 
It is better to be hated for what you are then to be loved for what you are not . 
No one is normal , there are just a lot of weird people with things in common 
You talk it , we live it , you start it , we end it . Your fuckin ' right we did it . 
Live your life without regret , don't be someone who they'll forget 
Our lives are shaped by the ones that love us and the ones that refuse to love us . 
I don't care what you think of me , it couldn't be as half as bad as what i think of you * LOL * 
Lifes a bitch because if it were a slut it would be easy 
Hell Yeah !!! beach bound baby ... we FINALLY made it ... let the party bagin .... 
we're home !!!! and the saga continues ...... 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! 
The truth is everyone is going to hurt ou , you just to find the one worth suffering for .... -Bob Marley

well ... i have red hair and its actually cute to me !!!! thank god 
“Most things break , including hearts . The lessons of life amount not to wisdom , but to scar tissue and callus . 
“We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified . ” 
\Love Kills Slowly . \"" 
We are born wet , naked , and hungry . Then things get worse 
The world is a grindstone and life is your nose . 
As we struggle to make sense of things , life looks on in repose . 
Life is not so bad if you have plenty of luck , a good physique , and not too much imagination . ~ Christopher Isherwood 
“Between men and women there is no friendship possible . There is passion , enmity , worship , love , but no friendship . ” ~ Oscar Wilde ?????????? 
Life is a quest and love a quarrel 
“Sometimes you have to let go to see if there was anything worth holding on to . 
“If I leave here tomorrow , will you still remember me ? ” 
“Promise me you’ll never forget me because if I thought you would I’d never leave . ” 
“Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love . \ " , 201 0-0 4-19 05:04:17 " 
“When I first saw you I was afraid to talk to you , When I first talked to you I was afraid to like you , When I first liked you I was afraid to love you , Now that I love you I m afraid to lose you ! ” 
“I TRIED MY BEST AND FAILED MISERABLY , THE LESSON I THINK I'VE FINALLY LEARNED ' NEVER TRY'!!!” 
Love is fire . But whether it's gonna warm your heart or burn your house down you can never tell . 
It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance . It is the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance . It is the one who won't be takenwho cannot seem to give . And the soul afraid of dyingthat never learns to live . 
look behind the mascaraand the shiny lipsticklook a little deeperand maybe you will seethat this girl you are lookingat really isn't me 
It's hard to determine where to draw the linebetween being nice and not hurting people's feelings , and standing up for what you believe 
We take a risk when we open our heartsbecause the truth is , if we open our hearts , we will get hurt . You can’t open your heart and not have some hurt because you’re in a human experience . Even if it’s the love of your life and you have many wonderful , deepening , growing , powerful years together , it’s a human experienceand that person will pass over . Love takes courage . Be courageous . 
I have found the paradox that if I love until it hurts , then there is no hurt , but only more love 
The past may hurt , but you can either run from it ... Or learn from it , the choice is up to you ........... IM NOT SURE WHAT IM DOING .... 
Sometimes you've got to get hurt in order to grow , Sometimes our visions seem clearer after our eyes are washed out with tearsHave a good cry , wash out your heartIf you keep it insideit'll tear you apart . Sometimes you lose , but you're going to winif you just < PROPFEMALE > in . 
Not all scars show , not all wounds heal Sometimes you can't always see The pain someone feels 
Do not assume that he who seeks to comfort you now , lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good . His life may also have much sadness and difficulty , that remains far beyond yours . Were it otherwise , he would never have been able to find these words . 
Sometimes I wish life was more like a multiple choice test instead of essay 
I was playing poker the other night ... with Tarot cards . I got a full house and 4 people died . 
you know i hate it when people play these \mind games\ " ..... if u dont want me .... or u just want me GONE ......... or whatever else be an adult and say so ..... dont mind fck me !!! " 
Don’t say you love me unless you really mean it , because I might do something crazy like believe it . 
“I love you ; not only for what you are , but for what I am when I am with you . ” 
asking for prayers for a FB friend's , friend's daughter . Please lift up Audrin < PROPMALE > and her family in prayer today . Hertwo year old daughter was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer .

Can you feel it crush you ? Does it seem to bring the worst in you out ? \ 
There's no running away from these things that hold you down\

But these colors that you've shined are surely not your style 
\Cold\ " \ 
What I really meant to say\ 
Is I'm sorry for the way I am\ 
I never meant to be so cold \ 
To you I'm sorry about all the lies\ 
Maybe in a different light\ 
You could see me stand on my own again\ 
Cause now i can see\ 
You were the antidote that got me by\ 
Something strong like a drug that got me high 
I never meant to be so cold\ 
I never really wanted you to see\ 
The screwed up side of me that I keep\ 
Locked inside of me so deep\ 
It always seems to get to me\ 
I never really wanted you to go\ 
So many things you should have known\ 
I guess for me theres just no hope\ 
I never meant to be so cold

The current planetary alignment encourages you to break out of a rut that may have stopped you from expressing just how you feel . You are also held back by thoughts of fear and failure , and feel like retreating further into your shell . Now is the time to be bold . It is better to be courageous and rebuffed , than never to have tried at all . \
