Nice to see that Obama is so weak that he can't even stand up to the barrage of lies , so instead he just drop the public option on healthcare , the democrats are still the weaklings they always were .

Hey everyone , Judge Chen is a radical , cause you know , he often thinks about how to better the country while listening to the national anthem , and he was afraid of religious intolerance after 9/11 . Everyone , fear him and make sure to lock your doors at night . 
Rush Limbaugh is a pig 
lol , gotta love philosophy homework : Where is the logic here ? We go to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction . They aren't there . Never have been . But we are still there . Our government accuses Saddam Hussein of implication in 9/11 . But they have proved that he was not involved . Is there logic here ? 
go yankees 
I love how the news says healthcare reform is unpopular with americans when nearly every poll about it shows americans want reform .
