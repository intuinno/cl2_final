A Rattlesnake , if Cornered will become so angry it will bite itself . That is exactly what the harboring of hate and resentment against others is - a biting of oneself . We think we are harming others in holding these spites and hates , but the deeper harm is to ourselves . ~ E . < PROPMALE > Jones 
Happy 4 years together Anniversary Love of my Life !!!!! I love you sooooo much !!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
