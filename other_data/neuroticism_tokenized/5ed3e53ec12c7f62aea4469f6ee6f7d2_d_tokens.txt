Feels sorry for those guys who's girlfriends try to turn them into celebrity look-a-likes .

I love my family and I love and adore my parents ! but this does not mean that we won't run into little riffs and snags . We don't always have the same opinion . This is the Honest Truth . but it doesn't matter how you feel about them at the end of the day because you will always love them no matter what !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
A look , a smile , a random comment , a very akward moment ; what does it all mean ? But why should i ask ; its all just a part of life .
