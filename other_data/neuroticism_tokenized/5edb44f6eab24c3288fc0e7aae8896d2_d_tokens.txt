When 1 door closes , another opens ; but we often look so long and so regretfully at the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened for us . 
You have to forgive to forget , and forget , to feel again ... There is no moving on without forgivess , & more importantly there is no new begining while carrying \old emotional baggage . \"" 
So we gotta flat !..! \

Things do not change , we change A person dat never changes his opinions , never corrects his mistakes , & will never b wiser 2morrow than he is 2day . OTOH : Ppl change & 4get 2 tell each other . -Lillian Hellman 
Some call it bein cold , mean , or heartless ... I call it bein honest !..! If you can't handle the truth then don't ask for it !..!
