But honestly , i give myself proops for not being institutionalized in some mental hospital by now !!!! LOL .... I love my life , friends and family but their is something missing I wish I knew what ??? 
see ... the reason i smile is not because im peppy but because it doesnt look right when youre being photographed =) 
\Success doesn't come to you ? you go to it . \ " < PROPFEMALE > Collins " 
Maybe\ 
the people were meant to be with are not the ones we love but the ones \ 
we sorta of love ? Think about it , how many actually end up with the \ 
perfect spouce , most relationships nowadays are corrupt , divorced or \ 
plain trifflin . Even after X years couples break up not caring what \ 
their spouces feel . Yeah , Im backed up by facts and experience ... What do\ 
you think ? 
Listening to Chio in the morning and getting ready to go to work ! 
Sometimes letting go of what we love the most , can and WILL open doors to something even more valuable and precious ... so dont be afraid to walk the unknown because happyness is just on the other side . =) ~ < PROPFEMALE > ( cheesy right ?? ) 
off to work , getting better at my job !! lol 
Tommorrow's my day off what to do ? If anyone has any ideas or plans call me or message me ! Bye 
OMG ... I have never been in so much pain as I have right now , I think I've got the flu =,( 
MTV\ 
asks its viewers \Will < PROPFIRST > Brown's BET Performance Revive His Career ? \ " \ 
Sometimes I feel as though I attact the same type of people , not in a bad way ! lol ( insider joke ) ;) 
Have the day off from work , now im watching supernatural and later going downtown to < PROPFEMALE > out and visit a friend . Im having a good day , i hope i don't jinx it 
? no no no don't phunk with my heart !!! ? 
I just found this and couldn't stop laughing ... \ 
\This is why women have babies 
I just ate 4 slices out of a large cheesecake I feel so fat but I can't help it , I love to eat !! why do we have to get chunky from eating , its a curse ??! 
\Relationships are like glass sometimes its better to leave it broken \ 
Yeah , like im gonna stress myself out cause of you , worry about yourself , i can handle myself ... whatever =/ 
Now I understand how it feels to be canceled on last minute . My life is not all about work I do have better things do to !!!!!!! (agrivated with irresponsible people ) >=/ 
its almost 2am and im sipping a hot tea latte while on facebook and doing other random stuff online . I gotta find something better to do ... 
Just came from work and the air conditioner was broken , sad , but work is work , right ? Now im home with the a.c on and having a lil fun online , ill be out later tho . =) 
I saw the Last airbender movie a few days ago , loved it but mad short ! Sorry , can't say more i don't want to spoil the movie

Life eventually turns into a treasured photography camera that in the end judges how we lived our lives . That's why we need to live them happily , peacefully and courageously in order to look at those photos and say \I don't regret my life\ " . Throw out the negative pictures or atleast restore them into better shape ! " 
From experience I learned that sadly businesses don't truly care about \ 
their customers , with a \sorry for the inconvenience\ " evrything is \ 
< PROPFIRST > Hart <3 lol 
o well , it is what it is . 
\Santo que no me quiere con no rezarle basta \"!!!" 
I hate rumors , for anyone that doesnt know Mr. Wong didn't pass away it was just a rumor , how can someone write something like that ?! 
? Somebody wants you , somebody needs you , somebody dreams about you every single night . Somebody cant breath without you its lonely , somebody hopes that someday you will see , that somebody's me \?~ < PROPMALE > Iglesias " 
Sometimes we lie to impress but we can't fool ourselves ... 
Atlantic city was fun , but some little kid beat me playing guitar hero , he was playing against me in expert mode while i was at medium ... 0 . o !!!! o well , i had fun anywayz ( plus went shopping)////videos games ( my guilty pleasure ) 
what you believe is my flaw , is what makes me perfect ;) 
uggghh , im so sick of love songs ( no pun intended ! ) 
Music is my ecstasy but I don't do drugs ??! o . 0 
If you are reading this , whether we do or don't speak often , post a \ 
comment of the first memory you have of me that pops into your head . \ 
When you are finished , post this paragraph as your status . You'll be \ 
surprised what people remember about you 
Up at 2:10 a . m listening to \With me\ " by Sum 41 and \ " Say it Right\ " by < PROPFEMALE > Furtado * like * " 
I just taught about something , the more break- ups you have , the better person you become , but ONLY if you truly cared about that person . Think about it , so youre in a relationship and you two split , so know its youre time to take in what you did wrong and fix it while being yourself openly . Little by little you realize youre philosophy that no one can change but yourself . Thats all I apreciate from break ups . 
The saddest fact is knowing someone never thinks about you when you cant stop thinking about them , but even worse is when they left a < PROPFIRST > in your life and you know they will be in your thoughts forever . Reminiscing right now . 
Flattery from me means modesty from you . Modesty from me means boring for you . I give you a big ego and you dont use it well , i dont care because big heads are just full of air . tHATS NOT C66L . [[ dont try to figure this out unless you want a headache :) [ INSIDER JOKE ] ]] 
My name is on a flyer ill be singing at my sister's college expo tomorrow , I feel so silly making a fuss out this !! ;) 
I am what I am , wont deal for 2nd best 
I love the fact I can smell a faker a mile-a-way ;) 
Smile and move on , that's all I can do :) 
Today is for packing all my college supplies and anytime soon Ill be heading to college , im extremely proud of myself and I have no doubt that ill succeed in college . :) mood : positive * feeling nerdy * 
its humid today , the heat and stickiness is frizzing my hair , i need my a.c. ( pronto ): / 
Something I would like to do before I move to IUP is go to a Philly's game , Ive always watched them on T.V but ive never had the < PROPMALE > to go to a game . My first priority next week will be to purchase a ticket and watch the philly's in action . GO PHILLy'S! 
Men with big egos , I swear . 
Wishing is for the hopeless but believing is for the determined . :) 
Im leaving Philadelphia tomorrow morning , ill miss u Philly :'( <3<3 But today ill enjoy the popular American tradition of Baseball game : Phillies vs . < PROPMALE > Astros ( hotdogs , baseball hats and the enormous foam fingers ) lol :) 
All my books together for ONE semester were $430 and most of them were used . Im practically broke right now and I can't start my meal plan until later ... BUT the campus is beautiful which makes up for no malls or any of my regular entertainment spots . :( ( Got to be a little soldier ) im here for my education . right now : listening to neyo cd and reading the newspaper 
People don't criticize when you say what they want to hear . But if everything was that one sided , then their would be no differences and we would basically have no motivation to create or improve . 
\ ... in order to understand my train of thoughts Youll have to put yo'self in my position\ " ~ T.I READY FOR WHATEVER " 
My first day of class and I was informed that IUP basically gets the same education as an < PROPFEMALE > league school . ( A few of the same textbooks and connections ect . ) Feeling relieved . 
:D College parties are fun and wild . I deserve a break , ive done my hw , tests and meetings for the week . I can party and still have time to geek off . Staying on top of my COLLEGE LIFE . 
Going to the library , I swear that's my chill spot . 
People need to understand that college is a LOVE-HATE situation , you NEED to set your priorities and follow them no matter the price or youll learn the hard way . mood : wise 
Also , I do believe that anyone can achieve their goals while developing into the person they decide to be . All you need is positive guidance ( someone who will be there for you and keep you in the right path ) and an OPEN MIND . An open mind will take anywhere in this world , those are the people who stand out and make it to places . 
I feel better right now . ;D 
Sola , PERO aunquesea , no mala acompanada ! 
You only need one hint to understand the whole picture ,, haha i got it . o well//not my loss :) 
Live and Learn 
Dis is ur babe sis saying luv is not a feeling u can explain but its a feeling u can show .... destiny calls sis 2 unite , cause sis luv last forever n memory hang ....... :) hihihi u been hack 
signout 
OMG I want to laugh and cry at the same time ,, i swear I love myself too much ... :) 
Weird Coincidences . :/ 
Laugh and be ignorant towards your problems . I don't mean hate but you need to be strong , if you dont they will eat you inside . No one but god is worth your tears . 
You stole my love for yourself but didn't give anything in return . You selfish bastard . lol 
\Families are like fudge - mostly sweet with a few nuts . \ " unknown " 
Sometimes I feel like a little kid admiring their idle , I have a tendancy of doing that . I have to learn that im my own person and others are just inspiration but whats important is to make myself an invidual thats others can look up to even if its just for an instance . 
I couldn't believe that a child's tale like \Sleeping Beauty\ " was originally a gruesome story which led to many different versions even before Disney's . Very Creepy . " 
I find a female with a smile more beautiful than any pretty girl . Theyre features radiate , indescribably and attracts me . Maybe one day males can see her threw my eyes . 
Crap , I need to stop procrastinating and study bye , FB . 
Being unique isn't easy , pleasing people isn't easy , love isn't easy ... nothings easy . One mistake you make cost's your future , your actions and taughts , who you become . Too bad some people give up on you when you commit that mistake and aren't willing to forgive . 
extremamente , indifinitivamente , seriamente -----> estoy relajada y feliz ,, termine mi examen y los proximos son faciles// bueno estudie para ellos , claro :] 
Loving my life . I feel like a spoiled child getting everything Ive ever wanted , and its still not over , in the future ill will still be the same way . SCHOOL+FAMILY+LOVE = SUCCESSFUL FUTURE 
Rule #1 : People need to stop stereotyping because Its funny the way they react when they get to know a person . lol\ 
Rule #2 : Get a life and don't worry about them . :) 
Don't you hate when you have friend requests but you don't know any of those people ? 
W- Well Grounded\ 
O- Optimistic\ 
M- Mothers\ 
E- Empowered\ 
N- Noteworthy 
\Practice what you preach . \ " ~ American Proverb " 
Im getting butterflies in my stomach :) 
In most cases women are the power behind the throne . Too bad men don't realize how strong and equal we are to them . :) 
I HATE last minute class cancellations . 
Loving Myself ! <3 
La belleza me da lastima . Es < PROPFEMALE > pelea de individu < PROPMALE > es , mujeres < PROPMALE > igu < PROPMALE > hombres que gastan tanto dinero , para no contribuir a la sociedad y solamente publican baja autoestima , la competencia entre humanos ( por razones sin importancia ) , y más numerosos problemas . De veras enque nos ayudas , dame < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > razon ? 
You'll know your okay with yourself when your able to laugh at your so called \imperfections\ " and not care what others think . Give them a smile ( to let them know you aren't ignorant ) and just move on . " 
My friends are TOO funny . 
Just got back from watching Ralphie May who was performing at my school \ 
( hes a comedian ) , he was funny , and he signed me and my friend's tickets . Ive enjoyed myself tonight . 
I wish there were an easy cure to everything . 
I have enough confidence to fix the self conscious and equally as much sympathy to be called weak . I know who I am , Im flawed and there's nothing I can do about it but live with it . Love me , i love you too . Hate me , I honestly don't care . 
Something I need to start learning is cooking . Im 18 and I can't even feed myself , unless , its microwave food . 
woop woop I going to Philly on Friday ;] 
People are extremely paranoid these day , its sad . 
Kids with Special needs are not sick or gross , they only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request : Is anyone willing to post this and leave it as their status for at least an hour . It is special education week , and this is in honor of all kids who are made in a unique way . ? 
Counting the days to I get to Philly . Ill be there tomorrow . 
:/ tsk , tsk , tsk . 
Im enjoying my time here in Philly with my family and friends . What about you ? 
Life is like a crossword puzzle . It takes time and < PROPFEMALE > to figure out the answers . 
Just bought a high quality web cam today on Black Friday , im hoping I can get some new equipment tomorrow for my laptop . 
Amazing , how over time bad experiences in our life turn into memories , just pictures in our heads , and there are no feelings attached . All your able to remember is that they were \bad\ " memories . That's all . " 
Growing tired of stupidity . 
hopefully u get home safe ... Lil sis 
ME : If I could rate you in a scale from 1 to 10 in \realness\ " ( I thought it was made up 
Mejor que tu ;) 
Im going to blow off steam over at the movies 
How could any mother leave her 8 year old son walking around the mall on his own with no supervision ? That's irresponsible ! >:O 
You want to know what makes me happy ? Feeling satisfied and confident about my grades . Although , if theyre not what I pictured I will feel silly for posting this . 
Sure , I'd love to help you out ... now , which way did you come in ? 
I don't bother with the insecure . 
Im broke to the point where I can't buy myself a snickers bar 
Some girls are pathetic , they need to talk trash about people to make themselves feel better , but without those friends they . are . s**t . But baby I can stand my ground alone and fearess . 
It doesn't show signs of stopping , and my dear were still good-bying but as long as you love me sooooOO ... Let it Snow , Let it Snow , Let it Snow ! 
I predict a HIGH grade on my Spanish test tomorrow . Confident but with a sore throat . 
Im finally home but went straight to a bday party , i dont mind my mom having fun but im tired from my long road trip :/ 
One of a kind means being unique , different , special and still being unafraid of your individuality . Why blend in with the crowd if you can stand out ? 
Passed my audition and now Im officially in IUP's University Singers ;] 
\the truth will eventually come out \"- unknown " 
Some people just don't know what to do with themselves . 
Why is it that some people can't act their age ? Those people make me laugh . 
If youre not ghetto people won't expect you to fight back . Those people need to rethink that concept before some bushee girl slaps them in the face and they be looking like \wtf just happened ? \ " . ( My little < PROPFEMALE > of Wisdom ) " 
I am PROUD to be part of my family . Since childhood , I have seen all of them grow and change to individuals with potential to change the world . They are talented and respectable people , knowing im part of this family gives me strength to stay in school and head for my goals . No matter how difficult , my family will always be there for me . They make me proud . 
When life doesn't give you lemons , screw it , you buy some lemonade . 
Why do all good things come to an end ? 
Try with determination , to the best of your ability , because the reward is knowing you've attempted and worked for your gains . Some individuals don't need to work as hard , but you are special because try and never give up . 
Heartfelt actions are sensed by others . If those actions go unnoticed it's a result of lack of effort , or your intentions are questionable . 
Happy Valentines Day 
I just air-sealed my window using a towel but the room has gotten 90% warmer . < PROPMALE > .
