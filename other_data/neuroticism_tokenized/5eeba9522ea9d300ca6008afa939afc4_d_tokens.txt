2012 Sheriff < PROPFIRST > Hege returns !!? Or should I say my real dad . Oh Ya'lls Aunt < PROPFEMALE > still mean !!! LOL 

What gets me is relatives who believe in this GOD thing or person has yet to explain it . Where their God can allow 5th or 6th cousins to steal a child , beat this child , curse this child , abandon ( mispelled ) , adopt this child , turn away from this childtake everything this child has including its real identity and steal its kids and sell them for money or as I call it cheap things , have it posioned 3x's for what , God . 
It's a shame when < PROPMALE > Jr/ can't show the respect he thinks is owed to his sorry so-called ex-dope smokin ' butt . Have you even considered instead of throwing public fits on myspace and facebook of trying to use the dang phone yourself stupid !
