Blessings on him who first invented sleep . It covers a man all over , thoughts and all , like a cloak . It is meat for the hungery , drink for the thirsty , heat for the cold , and cold for the hot . It makes the sheperd equal to the monarch , and the fool equal to the wise . There is but one evil in it , and that is that it resembles death , since between a dead man and a sleeping man there is but little difference . Cervantes
