1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 ppl is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in minority , and so much more , just because of who they are . Many gay teens are turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them to hold their heads high , & that you respect them for who they are , copy & paste this .
