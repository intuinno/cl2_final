best weekend ever !!!

is in training 
being cooked in this heat

was jumping off cliffs today . . . awesome ! 
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
SLO has just exploded with freshman ! 
alright who's back in SLO 
started school today . . . damn 
is both worried and excited for this quarter . . . bring it on ! 
obstacles are those things you see when you take your eyes off your goal 
there are two kinds of pain , pain of training and pain of regret . . . choose 
feel the pulse of the earth pounding beneath your feet , in your ears , all around you its alive and its pouring life into you , embrace it 
what do you mean funny ? Funny how ? 
never say never 
if history has taught us anything its that you can kill anyone 
the Dodgers just ruined my night 
what is your deepest fear ? 
its not about how hard you hit , its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward . 
loving your own does not mean hating others 
feels saturated with knowledge 
do you ever get to the end of your day and wonder what the hell did I do today , I hope that doesn't happen at the end of our lives 
thinks a short nap is in order 
has had all his sports teams quit on him 
is marveling at how the world works in real life and is not pleased 
is getting his penguin on 
if you could instantly get one million dollars but it meant that someone else would die , would you do it ? 
who needs sleep . . . its homework time 
is working on expanding his stomach in preparation for thanksgiving 
home sweet home 
is thankful 
oh my god that was delicious and now i can hardly move 
is normally a fan of bears but today is going to watch the trojans kill the bruins . . . yeah boy ! 
is trying to figure out what to do with his life but isn't having much luck 
whats more ridiculous the system or the people who just go along with the system ? 
is at the library , anyone wanna come distract me . . . please 
if you were on a sinking ship with 1000 people and there were only 900 lifeboat spots . . . who gets the spots and who dies ? 
if ten people were dying and you could only cure 9 which would you cure and why ?

fight and you may die , run and you'll live at least a while , and dying in your beds many years from now would you be willing to trade all the years from this day to that for one < PROPMALE > just one < PROPMALE > to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives but they will never take our freedom !
