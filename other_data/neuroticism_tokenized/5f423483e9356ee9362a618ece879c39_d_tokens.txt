another sun soaked season fades away 
live with intention . walk to the edge . listen hard . practice wellness . play with abandon . laugh . choose with no regret . continue to learn . appreciate your friends . do what you love . live as if this is all there is . -- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > radmacher
