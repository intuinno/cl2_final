I hate a mo#*er fu#*in laptop 
Had an awsome time visiting with my kid's this week . I miss them so much ! 
Was so happy to get time to spend with my kid's . Had a good time with them . Miss them terribly when I'm away from them1 
There is nothing worse than someone who thrive's on chaos and drama , at the expense of other's . Backstabber's , and hater's! 
Excited about going to see my family soon ! 
You can spend minute's , hour's , day's , analyzing a situation . Trying to put the piece's together . Justifying what could've happened . Or , you can leave the piece's on the floor , and move the fuck on ! 
I see this asking every day what's on my mind . When in all reality , nobody want's to know . 
< PROPFEMALE > Paredes reminded me how important my family , and friend's are to me . I want all of you to know how much I value , and love all of you ! \ 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > for reminding me . 
If anyone doesn't know about the Bilderberg group , do some research . It's scary ! 
Missing my yitta boy like crazy ! 
Actually have a picture with two grandchildren in one picture ! LIVE ON THROUGH THEM , FOREVER ! 
You think you really know someone . Then they make a fool out of you , and all that you stand for . 
I love the rain ! 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > are having a BABY ! After his cancer there was only a 50/50 < PROPMALE > he would ever have children . I prayed he would be a father one day , and it came true . Thank you God . 
Children going to bed withot eating ... Elderly going without needed medication ... Homeless sleeping in the rain ... Yet we donate million's to other countrie's before helping our's first ... The < PROPMALE > keep getting < PROPMALE > er . 
Yea , there is more rain , and a cool front here . 
Confushious say : He who goes to bed with problem , wake's up with a solution at hand . 
Our greatest < PROPFEMALE > is not in ever falling , but rising evey time we fall . 
Hello everybody , been oout of a computer for three day's . Hope everyone is well . 
. It's not about what level's you've reached . It's about maintaining your connection's with other's in each and every present moment . 
Learning without thought is labor lost 
It is easy to hate & difficult to love . This is how the whole scheme of thing's work . All good thing's are difficult to achieve ; and the bad thing's are very easy to get . 
Texan's did it , in O.T. 
My baby < PROPFIRST > has two teeth now ! TOO YOUNG FOR THAT . 
If you think in term's of a year , plant a seed ; in term's of ten year's , plant a tree ; in term's of a hundred year's; teach the people . 
If I am walking with two men , each one of them serve as my teacher . I will pick out the good point's of one , imitate them , and the bad point's of the other I will correct myself . 
Thanks to < PROPMALE > Thrasher for sending me Café Cash . I really like it ! http://apps.facebook.com/----caf--cas-gfdjgb/home?tv3=mKrRaGQbF%2BqUwyCBLDTJhy6Bh0igbhKybaPX3uoogw%3D%3D
