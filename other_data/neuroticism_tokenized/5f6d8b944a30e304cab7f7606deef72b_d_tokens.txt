The first institution in civilization was the family . Is it possible that the reason societies are so dysfunctional is because people put so much stock in those institutions other than the family ; schools , the government , religion , money ... Could it be so simple ? 
The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao . The name that can be named is not the eternal name . The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth . The named is the mother of ten thousand things . Ever desireless , one can see the mystery . Ever desiring , one sees the manifestations . These two spring from the same source but differ in name ; this appears as darkness . Darkness within darkness . The gate to all mystery . - V1

The Rakshasa sat in penance on the Himalaya , amidst five fires . Four he lit around himself to heat the blazing rock he sat upon ; the fifth was the pitiless sun above . Ravana was the son of the Rishi Visravas , who was Brahma's own grandson . Ten-headed , magnificent Ravana sat worshipping the God Siva . But even after he had sat for a thousand years , Siva did not appear before him . 
The brain is the result of time ; it is conditioned to protect itself physically , but when it tries to protect itself psychologically , then the me begins , and our misery starts ... The brain can learn , can acquire knowledge technologically , but when it acquires knowledge psychologically , then that knowledge asserts itself in relationship as the me with its experiences , its will and its violence .

Lashed by the eyebrow of the surge\ 
And flinging himself down into the waves\

Yam ? nu , was a god in Egyptian mythology who in the form of Amun-Ra became the focus of the most complex system of theology in Ancient Egypt .
