Afghanistan and have lost 9 Marines in 4 days . Please repost this . IT \ 
WOULD BE NICE TO SEE IT ON EVERYONES WALL , even if it's only for an \ 
... hour . Please show your support . 
Change your default pic . to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on Facebook until Monday December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse and invite your friends to do the same !!!!.. 
To the world you may be just one person , but to one person you may be the world . 
Battle torn , worn and weak , \ 
I stand in line to fight\ 
The wolf is hungry for his meat , \ 
which I'll not be tonight . \ 
My sword I raise above my head , \ 
and sound my battle horn . \ 
Odin if you hear me , \ 
My allegiance has been sworn . \ 
The strength of Thor is in me , \ 
I'll not fall as prey . With Tyr along to guide me , \ 
I'll find victory this day !

My heart & prayers go out to everyone in Japan who are devastated by the 8.9 earthquake & the resulting tsunami which is spreading all over < PROPFEMALE > & even is expected to impact as far away as Hawaii & the west coast of the U.S. It is unbelievable the shear devastation that has already hit & the after effects which are still to come .
