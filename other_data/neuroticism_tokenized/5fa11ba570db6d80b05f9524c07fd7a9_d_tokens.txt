Stuck inside of Mobile with those Memphis blues again ............. Man I love working seven days a week . 

I had two of the best meals of the year in Brownsville , Texas last week . I ate at a real Mexican place called Bigo's . Good fajitas and very fresh Rio Grande veggies ! 
Listening to Phish and Nacy Griffith while working late . Am I eclectic or weird ? 
My Dad passed away yesterday . I am with my Mom and family in Missouri . Tough ride in the big truck . 
Some year I am going to South by Southwest ..... 
I think that I still like August better than January . However , 105 degrees makes me wonder .... 
Mom is back in the swamps . She had a good time in DC , but she likes her own house . 
There is a weird clear liquid falling from the sky . I have not seen it in several months . 
Day is done .... Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > .
