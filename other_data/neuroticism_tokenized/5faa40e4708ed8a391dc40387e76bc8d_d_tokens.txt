Sick 
I just saw a commercial for insurance . there was something strange about it : there were about 5 people in it , 4 White 1 middle Eastern , all businessmen(/women ) . The four White people were sitting in chairs next to computers or standing next to a computer . the Middle Eastern guy was punching a punching bag . pretty odd coincidence ... 
Compassion for the brand 
I like my giant quote on my profile , I am proud of it , XD 
I just beat Portal again and saw the new , slightly tweaked ending the developers threw in recently . I feel so accomplished . 
One thing that annoys the Sh*t out of me : Die hard Wrestling fans trolling the comment boards ( on youtube ) on Aikido demonstraion videos , they constantly try to act tough and talk about how their favorite pro-wreslter could beat up the guy in the Aikido video , UGGGH , these people are so obnoxious !!!
