But your wheels just turn , down the road ahead . If it hurts at all , you aint showed it yet . I keep a lookin ' for the slightest sign , that you might miss what you left behind . I know there's nothing stopping you now , but I'd settle for a slowdown . 
just sat and watched the sunset for the first time in who knows how long . 
this is reaaalllyy weird . 
you know you're not too good at cooking when you almost set the top of your stove on firee . 
My friend , if I could give you one thing in life , I would give you the ability to see yourself as others see you . Then you would realize what a truly special person you are .

If you love someone , tell them , because hearts are often broken by words left unspoken .
