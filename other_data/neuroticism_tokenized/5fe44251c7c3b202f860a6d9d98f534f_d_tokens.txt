will be 18 in one month ! : ) I've been 17 for too long ! 

I am so tired of people who are slow in every way possible ; Thinking , walking , talking . The list never ends ! 
is now registered to vote ! : ) 
Its < PROPFEMALE > , bitch . 
Im so nerveous about taking my driving test :( 
I saw her wearing army pants and flip flops , so I bought army pants and flip flops . 
All of the rain . 
All of the thunder . 
Life is like a box of chocolates :\ 
It's big , it's blatant , and it desperately says \LOVE ME . \"" 
Absolutely delicious !
