Anyone ever stop to think just how sparse the universe is ? And how ... incredibly ... isolated we are in it ? In astronomical terms , we're a < PROPFEMALE > little planet hurtling around a medium-sized ball of gas in the corner of a medium-sized galaxy , 4 light-years away from the nearest ball of gas . \

Light-years . That's the basic astronomical distance unit . Think about that for a second . Objects in the universe are so incredibly far away from each other that it is the norm any closed system is so far away fro any other that it takes years , YEARS , for the fastest known element in existence to travel between them . That is to say they're zillions of < PROPMALE > away from each other . The distances ( as measured in non-insanely-huge units of measure ) amount < PROPFIRST > normal people don't even know the names of . Can you even fathom the amount of empty space in between celestial bodies ? Can you picture how much it is ?
