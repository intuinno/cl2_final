Getting to the very end of my rope when it comes to people and their over inflated sense of self importance and ego , which really hides Insecurites they have about themselves and life .

I heard something on sports talk radio the other day they said if you are a New England fan , that asking who you favord in the jets colts game , was like asking if you wanted to have your left eye poked out opposed to your right one ..... i just want to say , my right eye just got poked out !! 
Wow what a great game !! that was extreamly enjoyable to watch . i tip my hat to < PROPFIRST > farve and the vikings .. and to you < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > because when you told me in august that the saints would be in the bowl and beat the pats this year i did not belive you !! so Let's go New Awlan's let's get your first tropy ever ... it's a year of firsts !!

The bottles stand ? as empty , as they were filled before . Time there was and plenty , but from that cup no more . Though I could not caution all , I still might warn a few : Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools . 
Went to see the captain , strangest I could find , Laid my proposition down , laid it on the line . I won't slave for beggar's pay , likewise gold ? and jewels , But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

" 
It wouldn't surprise me if the pats draft offense at 22 ... like < PROPFEMALE > Tate . or if one of the explosive backs become available .. Tight End , Tackle ... Ect ... with the depth in the first 2 rounds this year , because of the CBA ... i think it is like 54 extra eligible players .... and the < PROPFIRST>'s haveing 4 picks in the first 53 picks ... i do think we will get some talent to add to the roster . 
Well , I have been a father a couple times over ... but this is my first time being an Uncle .

WOW i guess when you have a 30 something point lead over another team they just switch over to another game .... bah whatever ! 
How can you teach people who chose to be ignorant ? They wallow in their own comfortable bliss . Blind to things around them .

Just watching vids on < PROPFIRST > McCourty last night , weirdly enough .. and thought to my self he would be a good fit for the pats ... just didn't think it was in the first round !!

I hope the pats will pick up < PROPFEMALE > Tate with this next pick coming up ! and go celts !!!

Looking forward to see Rondo get another triple double tonight !! I know i shouldn't be looking ahead to the next series but the Magic scare me . not so confident of the match up as i am of the Cav's . 
Let's go Celts !! 
It's a game tonight folks . 
Looks like the Celtics all season , Rope A Dope is paying off !!!! they look full of Vim and Vigor !! Like i said to people before the playoff's ( you know who you are ! ) it's time to put up or shut up for the Celtics ... So far they put up . Now is the time not to be cocky , and go for team wins like tonight !! 
The Magic scare me Match up wise this next series !! But i never lose faith and i wont underestimate this Celts team ever this year !!! 
Man i can't believe how late i slept in today . Let go C's!!!!!!!!!! 
is in the process of writing a new song that i am pretty psyched about !! hitting a wall with the lyrics though .. per usual 2 verses in and a chorus , oh well they rest will come i am sure . 
Watch out gang green is coming !! 
I Love how < PROPFIRST > pierce winked at the camera after he said the the Boston fans are not going to let them become complacent in there next 2 home games ! 
The Celtics are on fire ! Yessah ....... 
There aint no time to stash the gumbo Or rattle around in a cage The sacrificed childs made bubbles And spittle is everywhere enraged 
going to take the boy for a hike up gap mountain . then i am going to come back and work on building the website for the Biz . 
I hate black flies ! 
is Yuengling deprived :( I wan't one sooooo badly right now ! \ 
But instead I live with the fact that they are a bunch of elitist brew masters , who deprive most of the country of the sweet nectar that is their beer .

All i want for my birthday is another Celtic Banner !! Game 6 would be a day before and Game 7 would be a day after , that still counts i think .... we shall see .... oh and ps .. another Patriot Super Bowl win wouldn't be a bad thing either . 
God i can't stand kobe < PROPMALE > ... guy seriously bugs me . 
\The\ 
I am watching the lakers win , but i don't think the better team is winning\ 
I am wondering what the score would be if the shots the celts were making were actually going in . 
After listening to some < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > tonight , it is more than evident that < PROPMALE > Matthews was heavily influenced by his singing style .. and even song arrangement . 
Gargamel !!!! Arrr ................................... 
Holy Rain Batman . i feel like i am in florida or something .... 
is pretty aggrivated that he woke up today and there is no tv stations ! i wonder if its the whole town or just mine .. if i cant watch the celts game tonight cuse of it i will be bullshit .

Back to the Garden , where it's all even ..................

I am the dirty 30 going to need a gurney , to lay down my head , after all of the good drinks ...... Sorry < PROPFIRST > reworded it on you .. lol 
Going to the killer for some B-day drinks .... no kids equals some free time for mumma and I . 
Went t the V last night first time ever ! really liked the music being played there , and think it maybe the first place i have seen around here that has rouge on tap ..... feelin that shit this a.m for sure though , hangover big time ! 
The green better take it tonight !! Losing Perkins is a crippling blow though ....... everone else needs to play like champions tonight , and wipe that smug look off Kobe's Face !! 
Freakin tired , need to go to keene to do some food shopping but kinda to lazy to cook tonight .... i wonder if google will tell me what i should eat tonight ... LOL 
Hmmm would love to rent some Canoe's today to take the kids out on , i wonder how much an idea like that will cost . 
R . I . P Grandpa , you will be missed !

Good stuff keep up the good work !

Wow whats up with all the new advertiments on here ? Kinda annoying , but better than having to pay for FB I suppose . 
Standing here \ 
The old man said to me Long before these crowded streets \ 
Here stood my dreaming tree \ 
Below it he would sit \ 
For hours at a time Now progress takes away \ 
What forever took to find . \ 
Now he's falling hard \ 
He feels the falling dark \ 
How he longs to be \ 
Beneath his dreaming tree \ 
Conquered fear to climb \ 
A moment froze in time \ 
When the girl who first he kissed \ 
Promised him she'd be his . 
Hmmmm i wonder if it's just coincidence that I get a blue screen error on my computer around 11:30 - 12 am every night for the last week ... it cant be . now if i can just figure out what software or drivers of mine is causing it , i'd be much happier . 
I thoroughly enjoyed last night ! i drank to much though . now to shake it off so I can bring the kids up to seths later for a good hike ! Not very happy about the fact someone stole a 18 pack of beer from us i have a pretty good idea who it was , like you said < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is a bitch they will get theirs . 
At a beach house in Groton CT with < PROPFEMALE > and the boys , thanks to the < PROPMALE>'s for inviting us to come , it's awesome here !! 
Man wish i was still down on the beach , next to that cool sea breeze . it's been a great couple of days . 
Bringing the kid's to see the monster trucks at the fair grounds ! 
Going to watch a pee wee < PROPMALE > movie with the kids ... they freakin love the guy for some reason . 
\Goodnight you moonlight ladies . \ 
Tuck and roll motha fucka , tuck and roll ... * said in < PROPFIRST > L Jacksons , Pulp Fiction character voice * 
Got home a half hour ago from spending all day tearing down a barn in this F'n heat and humidity !!! seriously WTF I don't live down south for a reason . a little much i have to say a little much , i could have passed for a black man with how much dirt and dust that was on me from sweating so much , and it basically turning into mud on me .. 
\I'm going to write my words on the face of today ! \"" 
T-Minus four day's till Patriot training camp starts and offically the start of the new season !! 
Waiting for football season is like waiting for a surprise or a vacation day , it doesn't come fast enough !! 
97% of teens ( and middle aged women ) would cry if they saw < PROPFIRST > Cullen from Twilight standing on top of a skyscraper about to jump . If your one of the 3% who would sit there eating popcorn , screaming , \DO A FLIP YOU SPARKLY BITCH ! \ " then copy and paste this as your status " 
Yup , bed time ........................................

Lindsey\ 
Lohan who ? I can't believe the news coverage being given to a spoiled \ 
20-something yr old . Here are a few 20 year-olds worth knowing about \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 23 , < PROPFIRST > Linley 29 , < PROPMALE > Weikert 29 , Justus Bartett 27 , \ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > 21 , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 21 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 26 , < PROPMALE > hew < PROPMALE > 23 , \

Just like in Music it's not about what you see , it's about what you feel ! 
< PROPFIRST > turned 3 today , how time flies ... Happy Birthday < PROPMALE > . 
See I once was a young fool like you , \ 
afraid to do the things\ 
that I knew I had to do . \ 
So I played an escapade just like you , \ 
I played an escapade just like you . \ 
... I sailed a wild , wild sea climbed up a tall , tall mountain I met an old , old man he sat beneath a sapling tree . He said now if you got some questions go and lay them at my feet . but my time here is brief so you'll have to pick just three .. 
I'm so tired , I haven't slept a wink\ 
\ 
I'm so tired , my mind is on the blink\ 
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink\ 
No , no , no . \ 
I'm so tired I don't know what to do\ 
I'm so tired my mind is set on you\ 
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do 
Wakey wakey eggs and bakey .............. 
Not sure what to think about the Shaq signing .. he plays piss poor pick and roll defense and never runs the floor ... but they do need big men till Perk comes back . 
Sweet talkin ' people done ran me out of town , and I drank enough of whiskey to float a battle ship around , But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you , and you will not hear me cry ' cause I do not sing the blues . 
Holy crap < PROPFEMALE > over city ............. keg beer does it every time !! 
Boredom is a foul beast , and it's been sharpening it's teeth on me ............. 
Pre-season games are better than no games at all . 
oh yes excited over this Pats team ... there is potential there for sure . 
It all relates to relativity . 
Wow way to many beers on a empty stomach last night ....... haven't eaten yet today starting to get a tid bit hungry here . Time to make a brunch for the ages . It's going to be damn good !!!! 
Butt Rock : A kind of music popular among tweens esp . in the midwest and is usually found in the alternative rock\ 
section of a music store . Butt rock bands usually have predictable percussion break downs , simple bass lines , simple guitar riffs and overly \ 
emotional/ semi romantic lyrics . 
Can't F'n sleep WTF 
Trying for round 2 of sleep ! It better come or else I may bash my head off of something so I can sleep LOL 
Home at 2:30 and hopefully my wonderful < PROPFEMALE > tapped the game as I requested about to go and check right now . < PROPFEMALE > if you remembered then you get a :) if not then I will :( Tears in beers and what not !! 
Yuengling oh fuck yeah !!! Thank you < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > for bringing me some up from Virgina ..... It's like Christmas in August . 
well it's 11:30 in the morning right now and after being up till 5:30 this a.m I am wondering why the hell I am awake right now !!! 
If you ask me I think grilled cheese sandwiches should be considered comfort food . I think they are anyways . Or it could just be my love affair with cheese ! 
All in all it's just another brick in the wall . 
Yup made it home did a < PROPFEMALE > walk across the kitchen and cracked the beer while winking a imaginary people ........ oooohhhhh yyyyeaaaahhh 
So maybe I could be a fly And feed arachnid as I die .. \ 
And view the ritual from within The silken tunnel that they spin .. 
Kids are off to school !! 
I need some Grammatical religion ... 
Well looks like we got the house in Richmond super stoked about that !!!! only downfall is I'll probably be without the internet for awhile .... I think I will have < PROPMALE > facebook withdrawals .... and withdrawals from all the other million things I do on the internet but 20 acres of land and a huge place to live thats not right next to the highway and cop shop are wonderful things :) 
Send me on my way 
is under the table and dreaming .. 
Gronkowskiis a beast ... he makes it look easy . 
In the shadow burns the flame that does not light the night\ 
as we dance in pure blackness praying to make it right\ 
Human is as Human does , some pray for forgiveness from above\ 
Some pray to make it right , to light the flame that illuminates the darkest night\ 
By Me ..... yup I know artsy some would say , but that's how I roll 
Roll away the dew . 
Just want to say every time I stay up till 3 the same 2 people are always on ;) If you feel like this is you , it prob is :) 
I usually would be psyched to go see music at the music fest but not feeling it this year ... it's pretty uncanny how some people can sap the passion of things right from you .... 
With our thoughts we make our world . Fortune Cookie 
moving shit blows !! 
F**ck I do believe I was hacked !! Be careful of what apps you accept on this site that's for sure !!! I kinda feel like I am on myspace again ! I really do hate the low lifes that sit around coming up with malicious things on the computer ... these people are lame ! 
When is Richmond going to get caught up with the 21st century ? I grew up in the town with no cable and there is still no cable . I don't want to pay more than I am paying now for shittier quality satellite internet !! I am adding this to the growing list of things I find very lame !! Anyone know who covers Richmond for 3g networks ?? I know it isnt sprint or at&t and they will not say who does those bastards !! 
Need to get motivated for more packing and moving , and sitting in front of FB isn't helping . 
mmmm coffee ! 
need some good moving tunes to listen to .. anyone have any suggestions ?? something upbeat but chill at the same time . I know that sounds like an oxymoron but .. i guess what i mean is I don't want to listen to metal . LOL 
Some people really do have an over inflated sense of self . like they are special and the world revolves around them and everything in it . I find these people lame and if I never have to ever meet another person with this character flaw again it would be too soon . :) 
I <3 Foot ball season ! go Pats !! 
there's battle lines being drawn , nobody's right if everybody's wrong , some people speaking their minds getting so much resistance from behind . it's time we stop hey what's that sound everybody look whats going down . Paranoia strikes deep into your life it will creep it starts when you always afraid step out of line the man come and take you away . 
just dumped a half a beer on to my keybord pad for my comp and now it doesnt work mix that in with the fact i have to work tomorrow and i dont yet have cable at the new place so i was going to record the pats game here while i still had cable and .. all the chords were taken to the new place ... so summery ...... 
is wondering how the fuck you actually defriend people on here would love to know .. 
ahh good didn't even need to do it myself ... 
I try really really , hard not to dislike people but I can't help it ..... so hard to actually meet genuine people in life ... it's a shame really . 
for those who call us the new # is 239-6510 ... goodbye for now cyber land . 
wow been awhile since I have been on here .... but going to build a smomeat smoker for the new place have everything i need but the directions that i had , but dont remeber where i put them on my comp . peace all ....... 
At last I stand toe to toe , with the things that come and go . With the thoughts that shape my world and grasp at nothing , my fingers uncurl . 
Yup everyday I am reminded how much I hate people . different day , different people same petty bullshit ... I often wonder to myself when will I meet some decent people in life ? you know people who are humble but confident , people who don't talk shit or create drama or down other people to make themselves feel better because of their own self confidence issues 
Ive been spending way to long checking my tounge in the mirror , and bending over backwards just to try and see it clearer . but my breath fogged up the glass . so I < PROPFIRST > a new face and laughed . I guess what I am saying that there is no better reason , to rid yourself vanity and just go with the seasons . 
Pass the hot sauce would ya , need to feel the burn . 
Day off , woke up with no power and in a foul mood !!! I hate winter !! not looking forward to going back to the abode and sitting with no power all day . But I suppose I can play the guitar don't need power for that , although I need new strings in the worse way ..... and ..... \ 
Ramble , ramble , ramble I really have nothing to say , \ 
other than I hate winter in the worse way . 
been months since i have been on here ... < PROPFEMALE > Christmas all . 
Hello me it's me again . another month later ...... Facebook deprived I tell you , Facebook deprived . 
Going with a old school profile pic ... I kinda like the black and white .. and of course you can see God in the window behind me LOL . 
Man I forgot I was a fan of Playboy on here ... they always have the best pics and links to share :) \ 
Ok < PROPFIRST > now I wan't to do something this weekend thanks for planting the seed in my head ... it will now grow into a costly tree of drinking and other assorted activity's ..... 
Going to go and see Dispatch this summer .... ohhh fuck ya 
at the library on the internet ... need to go get some kindling wood and some diesel fuel cuse we ran out of oil . 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s brothers place to watch the game ...... second year in a row I am rooting for a NFC team in the superbowl . I am not a NFC fan but there is 3 AFC teams I will not root for .... in no paticular order ... steelers , colts , and jets ....... and the best thing about the packers winning tonight is < PROPFIRST > Rodgers is NOT < PROPMALE > farve . 
I was thinking of playing rugby this year ... still up in the air though . it's cheaper than playing football but I am still weighing out pro's and con's . 
Holy crap deion sanders you look old . 
Touchdown Greenbay ........ again 
INT number 2 
OK So ....... I do not like the black eyed pea's .... just saying ....

When we remember we are all mad , the mysteries disappear and life stands explained . < PROPFIRST > Twain 
I think that if one truely wants to live forever , then all he or she needs to do is come up with some epic qoute . You know . One that spans generations . Preferably one that has much wisdom and grace as you can muster .... I think I may give it a shot . 
there is just no reasoning with some people . 
had a fun time last night ... good to chill with friends i havent seen in awhile ... and thanks to < PROPFIRST > for being our DD . Red red wine . 
got the officaial confirmation from bergquist last night ...... That means its on like donkey kong ...... stay tuned for some great music folks . Now we just need to pick a name . 
yup new song in the works ... I love when it is as easy as grabbing my guitar and it just comes out ... like it's been there the whole time . 
the whole time change thing sucks to get used to . But at least it stays light out longer thats a plus . 
As I Was looking back on my life ... and all the things I've done to me . I've been searching for the answers , I've been searching for the key's .... The wreakage of my past keep haunting me .. It just won't leave me alone .. I Find it all a mystery , could it be a dream ? The road to nowhere .... leads to me . 
The < PROPFEMALE > be they kings or poets , or farmers , their a people of great worth . They keep company with angels and bring bit of heaven here to earth . 
my body is your fiddle , only you can make me sing . 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > day ! I think some guiness is in store for me tonight . 
well I decided that I wanted some black and blues for < PROPFEMALE > day ... And I had the bright idea to go to blueberry fields to see if they have any blueberry ale , and they did bar harbor brand ... Never tried bar harbor blueberry ale so i grabbed it and brought it to the counter and it rang up at 10.50 six pack .... wtf it better taste just like i was eating blueberries !!
