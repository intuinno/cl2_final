I am Glad that : God won't ask how many friends you had . \ 
He'll ask how many people to whom you were a friend . God won't ask in what neighborhood you lived . \ 
He'll ask how you treated your neighbors . God won't ask about the color of your skin . \ 
He'll ask about the content of your character . Pretty cool God ! -rev . < PROPMALE >

A special thanks to all my FB friends for the wonderful kind words and Birthday wishes ! I made an important decision yesterday , since , I look older than 40 ( my real age ) and no one would believe the lie that I am only 30 and I appear to be about 50 . Logic states : that the only thing left to do is to tell everyone I am 60 then I will be assured the compliment '' Darn , you look good for your age!'' -rev . < PROPMALE > 
At the hospital with my good friend < PROPMALE > Roberts who is in the ICCU . Doesn't look good . But God is amazing . Let us see the power of prayer I am asking all my FB God believing friends to lift up < PROPMALE>'s name right now . A super great guy who loves Jesus . When doctors give up God goes to work . Would you all pray with me ? Thank You !
