what noise does the cross between a frog and a cow make ? 
my brother is walking around going \sppppiiiiddddeeeerrrrs\ " in a creepy voice . Should I be scared ? or maybe he is just embracing some spider-loving cult ? or is it a spider hating cult ? hmmm ... further investigation needed . \ 
Hahaha I miss ski season . Why ? < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and Will < PROPMALE > . They annoy the heck out of me , but they're really amusing .

cammy : < PROPFIRST > is going to DIE ! 
I love my friends . Tma potluck(almost all of last years class came ! ) and gs party thingy were both fun ! Very cupcake filled day ... first frosting them in the morning for nate , then eating them at both places(green ones ! thanks to < PROPFIRST > i think ) and < PROPFIRST > threatening to become a ghost and eat the cupcakes in our dreams(well that may not have been exactly how the conversation went , but it was in my mind ) . 
Finals .. I wish Friday would come quickly , but it probably wont . 
Field day tomorrow . Fun ? It really all depends on whether or not I end up being forced to sit out for an asthma attack or something(I have a feeling the new nurse is the sort that overreacts ) . Hehe at least I will probably have Lexi's company there ! 
< PROPFEMALE > has bad dog perception so she has to go to the brain dentist and get braces 
my mom says she won't pick up a snake because its \slimy\ " . I think we need to replace her . " 
saw toy story 3 with < PROPFEMALE > earlier :) 
And now ... Ive graduated ! now to summer , and chs as a freshman in the fall . 
Ahhh I have thistle marks(and the itching-pain-ness to prove it ) All over my left arm and leg from picking raspberries . Its really very painful . 
Can someone remind me why I was excited for summer ? Im already very bored ... 
dust mask = mask with a lot of dust in it 
nate(looking at his bright red arm ) \I'm not sure if that's sunburn \"" 
Raspberry bushes ... You are evil . I was relishing in my non-plague-girl-ness this year ... and now my legs(and arms/face to some extent ) look WORSE than last year(for those who dont know or dont remember , last year in may-june I got really bad poison < PROPFEMALE > and got the nickname \Plague girl\ " . I blame < PROPFEMALE > . ;) . However 
my fortune cookie is a creeper \it is a pleasure to talk to you \"" 
contrary to popular belief , raspberry bushes do not turn people into werewolves 
I dont think anyone could ever walk away from the Ulcickas ' house hungry . Especially a 4th of july party with steamers & lobster + a ton of other . I feel like a cannibal for eating the lobster after my lobsterification at the beach yesterday , my face & shoulders are VERY red . 
Happy 4th of july everyone ! ( off to camp tmrw , yay ! ) 
possibly the funniest quote from this week- \when you shake them it sounds weird ! \ " even funnier if you know the context " 
were in a bunch of yarn ! - < PROPMALE > has a hilarious sister though I'm sure he doesn't agree 
blackmailed < PROPMALE > into giving me < PROPMALE > kalela and < PROPMALE > s sister < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > cokes 
< PROPMALE > hudson erdman is planning on wrestling a catfish . that just made my day 
I am back from < PROPMALE > camp(again ) , it was pretty great , and I am not a trout . I just have to make that very clear . I am NOT a trout . and I made a chicken from a black and silver sweater , he is my new best friend . 
Today my brother goes \you are a vegetarian ? since when ?! \ " either his brain melted when I was away or he just wasnt paying attenton before " 
missing all my camp buddies a lot , from all 3 weeks of schepkers 
Re-watching Angel :D 
\this isnt mere dust . this is son of dust . this is the kind of dust that spawns countless generations of little baby dust \"" 
stopped at hayleys grandpas on the way to cape cod . then we took her dog for a walk and tried to go to an island in the middle of a marsh . got up to my thighs in mud , almost stuck , disturbed a cloud of hornets and then it started to thunderstorm . sofar my day has been great . afterall its not everyday you get knee socks made of mud :P 
so during camp we all managed to convince < PROPFEMALE > that the muffin man lives on mulberry < PROPFIRST > , not < PROPFEMALE > . now someones telling me its actually drurey < PROPFIRST > ??? its mulberry , isn't it ?! 
home from the cape 
new discovery(discovered by Sarah ): chocolate covered raisins & sour cream and onion chips taste good together ? 
rollerskating fund-raiser thingy was fun , though combined with swimming earlier I'm very tired 
Finds the Angel theme song oddly .. calming . well that and awesome . 
Chalkwalk was great , my fish won first place in the 15 and under part =) 
There is a difference between chocolate cake and chocolate BREAD 
\whats with this belly dancer outfit shes wearing ? \ " \ 
Orientation Today

If you are deity , of any sort , then please dont go , Ne me quitte pas , mon < PROPFEMALE > 
\Look at the wee little puppet man ! * gets bit by puppet * ahhh !!! \"" 
white water rafting was very fun today , but now Im so completely tired 
first day of school was .. busy . Im so grateful to every person who helped me find my classes , THANK YOU . And I have now opened a locker(mine ) once without help . Im proud of myself :) 
I think my locker hates me . It NEVER opens on the first try ... or the second ... or even the third ... 
I have no voice . It decided to leave , I guess , in protest to me being sick the last few days . 
< PROPFEMALE > + < PROPMALE > = <3 LOL < PROPFEMALE > Thompson < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
So XC in the rain ... and cold ... = drowned rat look . 
Finished my first actual cross country race today :D 
Its more than craisin enough . 
Back from Maine , ( for those who dont know I was there for a XC invitational ) . It was a pretty fun trip , despite 6 hour bus ride both ways and that I actually ran . Pretty enjoyable time with the canton XC team ! 
SPIRIT WEEK :) I dont know from experience if its fun , but everyone says so , and I get to wear pjs on wednesday , so , fun 
hey you other freshmen ... HAVE MORE SPIRIT . ITS SPIRIT WEEK . dont worry about looking stupid , its expected . HAVE SPIRIT FRESHMEN ! \ 
( wear a superhero thing tomorrow . or villain , that also part of our theme ) 
Just to make it clear to the boys XC team , because some things will make a lot more sense , < PROPFIRST > Kucia is my cousin . And I have bad asthma , which is why I often am seen gasping or walking(you know , not lazy , its like trying to breath through a coffee stirrer ) . 
So , tomorrow : \ 
Freshmen : BE SUPERHEROES\ 
Everyone : it is hug a cross country runner day . I hope you will appreciate you team and hug us . thank you . 
I like it on the kitchen floor . 
school today = depressing . even though it was pajama day . afterschool ? Awesome ! I got a personal best and almost what mrs cavanaugh wanted me to get(well , not that hard to do considering ive only run 2 meets before ) in the xc meet at stratton < PROPFEMALE > , and senior day which meant us non-seniors made signs , cookies , painted gourds , etc , and everyone was all happy , and it was generally fun . \ 
50s day tmrw ! 
xc psych party = food , trampoline , spinning in fields(cold , wet ground . ) , creepy faces ( very creepy < PROPFIRST > , very ) , marshmallows and fire . good day ? yes . 
Simsbury xc coach walks up to us at wickham : \I saw people walking in with long sticks and figured it had to be this team . If anyone was going to put up a tepee it would be Canton . \"" 
For those of you who have seen Dinotopia : you know Zippo , the librarian dinosaur ? he sounds just like the geico gecko ! 
split the inside of my lip in xc practice ... One might wonder how its possible to accomplish this when running , but I found a way . 
\Out of a gunnysack fall red rabbits ... \ " This has been stuck in my head all day " 
I need to stop leaning my face on my palm , in addition to a random swirling pattern I now have half of a pigeon and \peristeronic\ " printed backwards on my face in black sharpie\ 
witnessed some very intense ping-pong playing today between < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ... it made my day . 
\everyone wants to eat worms\ " \ " that hill makes it look like an abyss ... \ " \ 
Faces and arms are the bane of my existence , drawing wise . mostly arms . They are really awkward-looking when you think about it . Really , I mean it , just hold out your arm , take a good look at it , and I dare you to deny that it's awkward-looking . Now think of drawing that awkwardness , while fully aware of how awkward it will look and theres nothing you can do about it because arms look awkward ! 
Congratulations to the boys xc team , state champs ! awesome meet today , simply awesome . 
So tired ... I have not been this tired before ... \ 
Happy birthday < PROPMALE > , your party , twas fun . 
Happy Halloween ! trick or treating w/ maddy soon :) 
Interesting parts of my day : learning to play < PROPFEMALE > pong after school(teacher = Rose ! )\ 
Learning how , and that its possible , to climb on top of my refrigerator . the purpose of that adventure was because I got a < PROPFEMALE > pong ball stuck behind it , the only way to get it out was to stuff a broom handle between the wall and fridge , and then jab it until it wasnt behind the fridge anymore . 
4 down , 1 to go . Im almost done ! (thank you < PROPFEMALE > for your input earlier , especially on the first one ) I love it , but drawing people sure is mentally exhausting . 
I smell so strongly of campfire and chlorine right now ... And I cant begin to say what a great day today was . It wasnt any one thing in particular , it was just a really good day :) \ 
( to athan : I am warm now , no thanks to your terrible blanket wrapping skills . )\ 
( to deanna : I will get you the gnome picture asap)\ 
( to kendra : I love your house)\ 
( to dylan : my neck hurts ! )\ 
( to camila : your riddle games are fun :D ) 
I am in shock . 
Oh spencer ... ( martin . and < PROPFEMALE > ) You are WELCOME !!! 
Just saw Tangled with maddy and < PROPFEMALE > , it is such a good movie ! I was expecting something more around the quality of the last few movies disney made(which really werent all that great ) but it was much better than I thought . 
Im sorry I had to leave the xc banquet right after presenting the pictures , but I had a girl scout obligation ... I will put the pictures of the drawings up soon . 
Back from sundown , first day of skiing was fairly awesome . 
So I have a new phone :) and my brain is dead from skiing 
Im sick :( hopefully I won't have to miss school tomorrow 
so Im still sick ... and wont be at school tmrw . let me know if anything interesting happens 
Snow ! yay :D 
Home from first indoor track meet :) 
I have an idea for the summer reading cover(for Mrs eikenhorst ) and I need someone for it , from Canton . I just need a good picture of someone reading 
Sundown tomorrow , on snowboard for the first time . ( Sorry < PROPMALE > ! I still will love skiing and ski just as much ) 
First time snowboard went really well , I only fell badly once . 
Ive discovered that I dont actually know what to do with an evening I dont have homework . ( excluding ones I can ski , those are well-spent ) 
I have a turtlefur !!! Its neon pink and was in an old box of winter stuff :D 
Going skiing :) 
who will be at sundown tomorrow ? 
So much powder ... :D 
while it was not too much skiing , 11 1/2 hours straight was slightly ridiculous :) Im thinking maybe a little less tomorrow .. 
nobody ever will get work done in a place that has spinning chairs ... :) 
Indoor track meets are really ............ really .......... LONG . 
the pope is not a tapeworm . 
Hmmm ... early dismissal . What could I possibly do with all that time ? And small amount of extra snow ? Oh wait , I can SKI !!! 
SNOW 
Today was a phenomenal skiing day 
Ski sundown's fries and cheetos go amazingly well together 
Tomorrow is a snowday . Sundown here I come :) 
To anyone who is interested : I am selling GIRL SCOUT COOKIES so if you are interested seek me out . ( they are really good cookies and worth buying ) 
Snowboarding today ? Yes . \ 
( I will bring my skis also because I still love them . ) 
It's so wet out ... not a great day to be at ski sundown . 
good job to all involved in Prisms , it was fantastic 
Im currently embarassed for the black eyed peas , this is a terrible show ! 
I had a half an hour long laughing spasm today , and now Im shaking . It all started with me seeing a moose on someones t-shirt at prisms and now Im going crazy(the moose was just there , right at eye level , and it was like ... oh look theres a moose ) 
Today I discovered how to make english vocab cards fun- make every drawing and sentence about turtles . It works ! 
My family tree is confusing . Why must my grandpa have 13 siblings ? 
I'm so bright and orange !!! 
I got to be a sled passenger today , because < PROPFEMALE > Clarkson was catching up on her ski patrol lessons :) 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s day to all . ( Tomorrow , but I know I would forget if I didn't post it now ) 
F period study hall and G period bio were probably rank among the funniest classes I've been in this year . 
< PROPFEMALE > Gassmann almost got by a car today because she was NOT wearing a neon orange sweatshirt(ITF ! ) like I was . 
maddy loves < PROPFIRST > because she is awesome 
MADDY GASSMANN LOVES < PROPMALE > WATSON 
What is the point of diet caffeine free Coke ? I'll tell you : to ruin my dreams . 
I wont be in school tomorrow , for I am going to Mad river < PROPMALE > to get telemark skiin lessons , because < PROPFEMALE > Clarkson invited me :) 
My brother made me pancakes :) 
I love smoking crack and worshipping Satan . 
\look its a floating blog of green puke with smoke coming out of it ! let's go investigate ! \ " Marahaha ... our bus conversations make me laugh . " 
GS are gettin ready for Westpoint :) 
I hate being spoonfinch . Everyone picks on spoonfinch :( 
Good luck to cast of < PROPFIRST > :) 
Im thinking of doing a large , colorful painting(or pastel , I don't know yet ) of the coat from < PROPFIRST > and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . What do people think of this idea ? And did anyone get a good picture of it theyd like to suggest ? 
Just watched the episode of weeds where < PROPFEMALE > spektor does the theme song . My day is made . 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Ericson , we just walked down the hallway reciting the < PROPFEMALE > balcony scene speech loudly because the announcements told us to .
