life is too short to not get in touch with friends , make the most of it and contact they ones you haven't talked to in a while 

well i'm at it again , my back has given out again and i am stuck at home , without working again . 
life seems to hand everyone a certain hand , it is up to you how you are going to deal with it 
when life gets you down , look up and there is always someone there to lend a hand 
well the joy of moving is over , now it is the fun of unpacking and putting things away 
Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes , my internet is down for the time being so i was unable to respond right away . so far everything is going good , i will be able to keep in touch more often here soon . talk to every one later . have a great day . 
well winter is finally here , and all we will do is complain it is cold , oh well , we will all fun 
Instead of giving myself reasons why I can't , I give myself reasons why I can . \\ 
well up for another 24 hours and still need to be up longer , this really bites . Sleep is going to find me sooner or later , with the night off , it is going to be great . 
My first grandchild coming in July to < PROPFIRST > and his girlfriend < PROPFEMALE > a boy was confirmed yesterday , Aidyn < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > will be the name , a bit scared but I think everything will work out just fine . 
Moving to Aberdeen with my fincee and his kids are moving with us , that will make 6 kids and 1 grandchild , i will miss my other grandchild that will be born in the next few weeks 
my grandson . really scary to even think i am a grandma , yeaks , lol it was bound to happen sooner or later 
well we have looked at a house in Aberdeen and i can't wait to say it's official that we are moving , but still looking , hoping it's going to be soon . I know i can't wait , kids just keep giving me those looks . 
Things are going somewhat good , dealing with some off the wall stuff but still trying to locate a place for my kids . I really hate moving . 
I am always looking in through the glass , but never able to join in the fun . Life has it's way of making everything seem so meaningless 
Thank you to all my birthday is going good so far and going to be a very memorable one 
i like it in the car . 
Heading out to see < PROPFIRST > , can't wait , hope we can get Aidyn to laugh for daddy like he does for his mom and grandma 
well the visit was a good one just hard on leaving and knowing right now that he can't see the one he wants most of all , soon i will get that going and hope it is soon , love you baby girl 
Well just got in contact with family , that i thought was lost from me . My grandmothers nephew was able to contact , and now we are talking , can't wait to find out more . 
from what i am getting told i have been getting stressed wonder what can get rid of it and keep it away , i think life just stresses people out too much and they worry about the little things

Well < PROPMALE > goes in for hopefully her last test to see if they can find out what is wrong , then we wait for 6 weeks to see , otherwise one more test and I know she isn't going to like it . She just wants to go back to school 
It has been a long 2 days , Savon was admitted into the hospital Monday night and was just released today . He is tired but at least feeling alot better . 
Well its official i have gone back to my original name . Have to say it feels good to be a Geraets again , i feel like a new person . 
now that my name is changed back it is just trying to remember to sign it 
Not knowing whats going really hurts , and becomes scary , I just want to know .
