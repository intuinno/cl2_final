is refusing to go to sleep for the sheer need to be difficult . :P 

\Stupidity's only true rewards are faith in God and a hell of a lot of experience . \ " -- Zach Loveless --" 
As my final Christmas present , received yesterday , I got Munchkin . 
Tomorrow's gonna be awesome . 
Lovin ' my life & my lady 
My girl's on my mind , like usual . ;P 
Planning ge t-t ogethers is a real pain in the butt ..... 
Hurting emotionally . Honestly , I don't even know it's worth the tears , but I guess that's the price I'm paying . 
I think New Divide ( Linkin Park ) and In Between ( Linkin Park ) describes how I'm feeling . I just want to talk to her to see if we can be friends . I'm not confused , nor going to try for what once was , but I want the friendship we used to have , before this , before us . I think what I really want is to talk , but it's her choice . If she wants to be friends , then we'll be friends . If she doesn't , then well ... 
Yumi makes me laugh . \I just had a coke ... * hehehe * ... it's really good !!!.... Hehehe ... \"" 
Really loving my life . I honestly wouldn't have it any other way . 
Gonna have to talk to < PROPFEMALE > about something tomorrow .... it's very important , and I'm not sure how to feel about it now , so I'm going to sleep on it , then talk about it . < PROPFIRST>'s already helped . 
Now that I've slept about 4 hours out of the 9 I intended to get ...... it's just a matter of waiting and talking things over . I'm not mad , but it shocked me ; it hurt . 
* collassal sigh of relief * I never thought I'd be suspected of thinking badly of someone . Now I just wanna talk with her to set things straight . I'll be online , but not at the comp for a little while whilst my mom's on . 
Much better . Spending time on monday will be great . 
Oh-well . I guess being single won't be so bad . It still hurts , but time can heal wounds like this . 
O_O Holy Sh*t !!! I would pray for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Ton , but it seems no God can help him now . 
I just went back over the 57 comment long \Is Theatre a Cult ? \ " post from < PROPFEMALE > . Holy-hell ..... I'm half surprised < PROPFIRST > hasn't offed himself in sheer terror . " 
Oreos . Nuff said . 
Apparently I've got my very own hate < PROPFEMALE > now . I had thought about making one , but I figure it's just someone messing around . < PROPMALE > Loveless Isanasshole is is the username . 
I'm not a B*tch , i just have a low tolerance for Bullsh*t . 
WOOOOOOOOO-HOOOOOOOOO IT'S FRIDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
* extremely deep breathe * Friday'll be awesome , one way or another . < PROPMALE > Project's gonna eat meh alive ...... 
I'm playing pokemon gold on my gameboy color . IT'S AWESOME !!!!

lvl 100 Gengar . 3 down , 3 to go . Pokemon rules .

I just did the glitch to get Mew . Lvl 7 Mew for the win . 
I miss my girl . I hope she's able to go on Thursday . * needs a huggle from her * 
F*ck ...... there goes Thursday ..... my mom's going on a trip from thursday to Saturday , so my Thursday is gone , but Friday and Saturday are open . I NEED someone to < PROPFEMALE > with on Friday !!! 
Gotta figure out my Friday . I wanna spend it away from home , probably at someone's house , the entire day . The rest I'll be able to figure out with Pixie . 
Guess who just got a Formspring ....? 
YUMI\S FINALLY BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
My frickin ' gold version deleted itself ...... there goes 248 data entries in my pokedex , 2 mews , several masterballs , and nearly 11 of my favorite pokemon at lvl 100 . Great way to waste over 235 hours ....... fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh ......... 
I'm missing my girl right now . I just want to hold her close and feel at amazing feeling I get every time we're together . 
Feeling crummy , though my awesome friends and Ink did lift my mood . 
Okay , then effect wore off , back to feeling sh*tty ...... 
Listening to lots-o Country . Everybody wants to go to Heaven , by < PROPMALE > Chesney , is my favorite so far . 
Got a country playlist building up , gonna link it in a day ' r two . 
Is < PROPMALE > year the year most people who intend to end up dropping out ? 
Feeling like crap right now . Sick-ish . Stll going to the show tonight . 
A bit mad at myself , but steadfast . 
Feelin ' pretty good about myself . Made one of my best friends so angry they quite talking to me . F*ck ...... 
F*ck ..... apparently Blockbuster needs to update their website more often ..... They had sold all of their copied of Ink a while ago , now they only had 1 copy ( for RENT ) for $20.00 , not including tax ..... 
I love a Whiskey Lullaby . 
Is sitting nearby someone who's gonna have one hell of a time in college . 
boooooooooooooooooooooooored .... 
< PROPFIRST>'s was pretty damn great . I love Theatre . Period . 
\A word to the wise ain't necessary \ 
Helping people is difficult as all get out and just as frustrating , but totally worth it . 
Think the Uchiha's got faked out by the constant red-eye in their family photos ??? 
* is putting the bourne films into my bag as I finish typing this * 
JUST GOT INK IN THE MAIL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
My day just keeps getting better and better : I just saw the comercial for Book of < PROPMALE > coming out on DVD Tuesday !!!! Between that , getting Ink , and a few other things I'm waiting for , this is the best day I've had in months !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
is feeling like he could wrestle a grizly and win . 
back in a little while 
be back by 7:45 
Can barely wait for tomorrow . Sleeping in will be a blast ! 
I'm thinking about having an event next week to watch Ink and < PROPFEMALE > out with everyone . Maybe at < PROPFIRST>'s house , but maybe at mine . Comment if you're interested , add ideas and what days are good for you too ! 
Apparently somebody escaped from Tumwater jail 30 minutes ago ..... fun stuff ..... guess who's less than 10 minutes from the jail ....? 
back in a few people 
Toy Story 3 is FOR THE WIN ! 
My mom really needs to learn how long 5 minutes really is . She thinks it's somewhere around 1 hour-ish . --,-- \ 
\ 
Also : Fixed my xbox . Apparently my brothers & I never thought to remove the hard drive before turning it on . I wanted to just take it out to the football field at the high school & punt it for a few hours ....... Karma likes to kick me in the ass ..... 
\ ... Blow something up in the name of Jesus . \ " Thank you Youth Pastor Nate . " 
Is missing his friends badly . New Market's fun ' n all , but I wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with people I haven't < PROPMALE > with in a while . ( yes , I know school's only been out for 2 weeks .... ) 
Is modifying nerf guns & feels pretty awesome . 
Females are confusing creatures . 
Schedule time : 1st through 3rd I've got Running start ( Western civilizations at 8:00 and Cultural Anthropology at 9:00 , no 3rd period ) , 4th I've got Pre-Calc . ( Suderman ) , 5th I've got Poly . Econ . ( Unsoeld ) , and 6th I've got advanced theatre ( Cummins , of course ) . \ 
I'm thinking about swapping pre-calc & poly . econ . and taking < PROPMALE > rather than Suderman . 
Off to Chelan tomorrow with < PROPFIRST > & his family for an * entire week* !!! 
Even though absence makes the heart grow fonder , it can also make it hurt a whole lot more . 
Missing people sucks . It really does . 
My dad's Buick has great handling ..... if you're older than 40 and are going 2 mph ..... 
When it means enough , you'd give your life and well-being to it and for it . 
His name was < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Thahn Tong . 
Some say the world will end in fire ; \ 
Some say in ice . \ 
From what I've tasted of < PROPFEMALE > \ 
I hold with those who favor fire . \ 
But if it had to perish twice , \ 
I think I know enough of hate \ 
To know that for destruction ice \ 
Is also great \ 
And would suffice . \ 
— \Fire and Ice\ " by < PROPFIRST > Frost \ 
Me & ____ would make a cute couple . Copy this to your status and see who you get . =) 
Managed to modify one of my Nerf Longshots to shoot around a < PROPFEMALE > of 45 ft at a 10 degree tilt(max of 57 ft ) , and at about a 35-40 degree tilt I can get between 54 & 66 ft . \ 
Yes , I am a geek , no , I don't care if you think less of me . Probably gonna sell it .

Older sibling got the new Disturbed album ( Asylum ) . Wiiiiiiiiiin . 
Faith is a living , daring confidence in God's grace , so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
I miss someone in the worse way , even though their physically near 5 days a week . 
One of my personal favorites & one of the most epic songs ever written : \ 
( I Just ) Died In Your Arms , by Cutting Crew 
I love the shower . \ 
Just for a shot at opinions ; Hot , Warm , Cool , or Freezing ? 
Friends can make all the bad go away . :) I know mine seem to . 
is working out how to say what he needs to say without being mean , scathing , or emotionally self-destructive . Ugh .... I need to talk with a few special people who know what's wrong .... :( 
Happiness is giving your blessing , approval , and support for someone you care about . ( You know who you are . ) 
Name a movie that made you feel amazing . For me , The Hangover makes me love life every time I see it . 
Anyone besides < PROPFEMALE > & I going to see < PROPFEMALE > Swim club tonight ? 
Woot , Youth group ! 
Anyone wanna go see the play at Oly Little Theatre this weekend ? ( Sat or Sun , preferably Sat ) 
Anybody who applied for the PAC who recieves a slip about it tomorrow indicating your selection , there will probably be a meeting after school tomorrow around 2:20 -ish . 
Well , that was a good way to waste a few hours .... * rolls eyes * 
One of my favorite things about leaving parties and football games is that I always get a couple of hugs from awesome friends . 
Confusion can be the spark of insanity and genius . It just depends on your mood . :) 
Whenever I hear someone tell someone else that they're their \One and only\ " all I think is \ " What about God ? \ " \ 
I'm asking this because I'm stupid & never thought to ask ; Where is homecoming ? 
Carnations and Baby's Breathe smell great . 
Officially has a date for homecoming . 
is supposedly being punished by his parents by only going to youth group to retrieve a book I forget last week . \ 
In reality land , my dad will be driving home by himself . I feel sorry about it already , but being punished by not being allowed to go to youth group because I forgot to check in last night ? I think not . \ 
Defience to remind myself I'm growing closer to God ; how ironic . 
Once upon a midnight dreary , while I pondered weak and weary , \ 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore , \ 
While I nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping , \ 
As of some one gently rapping , rapping at my chamber door . \ 
`'Tis some visitor , ' I muttered , `tapping at my chamber door -\ 
Only this , and nothing more . ' \ 
Love this poem . 
Is going out for a spin in my dad's gold 2002 Century Buick . That car's got balls . 
Got a new shirt for homecoming . Apparently I can only wear athletic-cut shirts now . =) 
hates having to bite the bullet , but it'll be worth it come saturday . I still hate letting people down , and I STILL do not understand why it's a crime to forget & be unable to call . 
is on top of the freakin ' world & loving his life . 
is waiting patiently . 
* kicks my computer's parental controls * I hope you're online tomorrow . :) 
Can't wait for tomorrow !!!!! 
Myself and several close friends of mine have had an exessively epic day . Like ( and comment if you want ) if you've had an epic day in the past week . 
Seeing as how well the last \like this\ " status went .... Like this if you have plans for the day after homecoming ! " 
Is wondering why , when everything feels so amazing , so perfect , a single mis-read sentence can ruin it . Ugh . I hope I can sleep it off and make things right . 
Okay people ; It's idea time . What should I be for Halloween ? 
will be building < PROPFIRST > Browne the Hydra shotgun from Resident Evil 5 . He is planning on cosplaying as < PROPFIRST > Wesker . 
is hoping she'll have < PROPFEMALE > enough for me . <3 
Homecoming was great . Beat the heck outta last year's . 
is feeling happy . The Lord is gracious . :)

( btw , I woke up aout 10-ish minutes ago . XD ) 
Had a great night with friends . I can only think of one person who could make it better ... 
\Could you find the needle in the haystack when someone is setting small fires all over the haystack you are looking in ? \ " -- Badger 
Understanding is a nectar I yearn for . Every time I taste its truth , it slides down with a sugary tang . 
Like my status and i'll tell you something I like about you . 
Canteloupe leaves a weird aftertaste .... 
Time to drive ... 
G'night all . Don't quite know why , but tonight , I'm in love with life . :) 
I'm off to drive on the freeway for the umteenth time . Scaring my father out of a few years of life seems to have become a passtime for myself . Is that a bad thing ? 
Back and bored . I need something to do tomorrow other than youth group . So .... from some time until about 6 pm tomorrow . 
is going to youth group tonight after a day full of pretty much nothing . 
\Youth group was delicious . \ " -- Nate Mazzuca --" 
Is driving out to Harbor Freight Tools with my mother < PROPFEMALE > a few minutes . This will be her first time in the car with me driving . It is dark , raining , and I will be using the freeway and some back roads to save time . Oh the fun I will have .... 
Is loving theatre . Every day it lifts my mood and brings me happiness . I don't quite know if it's just theatre in general or the people I get to spend time with , but whatever it is , Theatre is theatre , and makes my life all the better . ( Plus it seems that theatre people give better hugs ..... ;-) ) 
Is trying to figure out how he'll convince his parents to drive him ( or let him drive ) to Capitol High on Thursday . If I'm unable to .... well , I'll just hope they're in a good mood . :-/ 
' s title is forfeit . He is now , to his distaste , useful . 
The book , Killing Floor ( by < PROPFIRST > Child ) , is AMAZING ! I looooooove good book recommendations . :D 
If you think I'm cute , like my status . If you love me put a heart . If I'm a good friend put a :) If you miss me put a :/ If you ever had a crush on me put a XD . ............................................. If you're not scared , put this as your status

Like this status if you aren't going out on Friday for a \Black Friday\ " sale . " 
Has rediscovered the engineer within by playing with the insides of a few nerf guns . Over-powering them is entertaining until they explode in your hands . 
Needs to take a trip to Ace Hardware at the Southgate plaza to see what they've got in reguards to springs , piping , and bonding agents ..... -,- 
Is having an interesting day ... 
Is in a nerfing mood .... 
Like this if you enjoy hugs .

Raging done . I'm dueling my younger brother with Yugioh cards . * shrugs * 
wishes others could feel what he feels . :-/ 
My heart is like an open highway . 
2010is almost over , so like this status if I have made you smile this year . Then set this as your status , you'll be surprised how many people have smiled because of you :) 
\NO VAMPIRES IN TWILIGHT . ONLY < PROPFEMALE > FAIRIES . \ " Thank you Courage Wolf ! " 
Dear Lord ; Thank you for Music . It gives us life , from our heartbeats to our breathing to the sound of water , or the crackling of fire , we thank you . Sincerely , Zach . 
Is sick of ignorant people . ugh . They all need to go away for a while .... 
It's officially a sin against God and all of mankind to have to get up early . * wants his bed * 
Is wondering where our Fem . techie was today ..... 
woke up at 12:15 & is very happy about it . \ 
Good luck T-Birds ! 
Is bored and needs something to do . 
Is now awake and is wondering what he'll be doing today ... 
Question for Everyone : What cartoon/anime character should my profile picture be ? 
Is bored . 
is off to youth group for the first time in 3 weeks ! FINALLY !!! 
will smile tonight whlie drifting into slumber . 
Is tired of people who he's required to tolerate .... ugh .... 
Anyone know how to undo \upgrading\ " your facebook ? I HATE IT !!! " 
Hopes tomorrow goes well . 
There is a fine line between genius and madness . < PROPMALE > Bumi uses that line to skip rope . 
Got jipped out if his weekend plans & needs someone to < PROPFEMALE > out with . 
Dr. Who . \ 
( Just wondering what will happen if I post that . ) 
Time to be a follower : Message me a number I'll post what I think about you . 
Is setting up his 360 on his family's 42 inch LCDTV . 
\I'll rip the head from your body !!! \ " Silly Brute .... " 
The Choir concert went well . Everyone was AMAZING !!! I even got to see < PROPFEMALE > again ! 
People being mad at you sucks .... 
Dear Lord ; Protect us on our way . I won't ask for tomorrow , but only for today . 
As a College Student who is dying about his final , I desereve hugs and reserve the right to demand them . :P Unsolicited hugs will probably be much appriciated . 
hates writing papers ...... only crummy thing about being in Tech . Theatre .... 
The concert was AWESOME . The band & orchestra were great ! 
Let's see how creative my face book friends are . Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name . It can only be 1 word . Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Don't just post a word & not copy , that's no fun ;P 
< PROPFIRST > Cusack’s character says in Grosse Pointe Blank :\ 
Martin : You do it because you are trained to do it , you have the strength to do it and the courage to do it and ultimately ( pause ) you get to like it . I know that sounds bad . \ 
Debi : You’re a psychopath . \ 
Martin : No , no , no . Psychopaths kill for no reason , I kill for money , it’s a job — that didn’t sound right . 
Love is an interesting thing . It makes you < PROPFEMALE > someone even when they don't know they need it . It took me a while , but recently I've begun to < PROPFEMALE > someone near me more than I ever did , and in a way rather contradictory to my usual . It feels good , like the rays of sunshine that stream onto your skin after a cold rain . 
My day's going fairly well . I think I'm goning to call up a friend & < PROPFEMALE > out with them , provided they're available . 
Is bored again . :/ 
If you could choose between life\ 
and death you would almost rather die , \ 
love is fun but hurts\ 
so much the price you pay is high . \ 
And so I say don’t fall in love , \ 
you will get hurt before your through . \ 
You see my friend , \ 
I ought to know , \ 
I fell in love with you . 
Question : Pocky = Otaku-nip ? 
Off to my grandparent's house for family time . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all , and to all a good night . ^_^ 
Happy birthday to Jesus , and good morning to everyone else ! 
Loot Thus Far : Zombieland on DVD , Fallen by Evanescence , Believe by Disturbed , a Dremel Multi-Max , an additional 110-piece bit-set , < PROPFEMALE > , the original 15 episodes of the 1943 Batman on 2 disks , < PROPFEMALE > , and $50 ( from my amazing grandparents ) , and some AXE \Dark Temptation\ " Shower gel . " 
The perfect ending to a perfect day . \ 
You know you're in love when the waiting is the second best part , only eclipsed by each time your faith in them and your love for them is restored . 
Forgiveness is a worderous thing . It can give your mind rest from hatred , anguish , and general negativity . But then again , is it just a means to an end ? or simply allowing yourself to let go of the hate ? 
Hope can keep any dream alive and any heart beating . 
Really wishes he was playing Zombies & Quarantines . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is a genius . 
Is officially bored . 
Is going for a run to regain control . It's a heck of an alternate to stabbing someone . 
That felt really good . Incidentially , whenever coyotes approach you , if they look hungry , stand your ground and be loud . They don't like it . 
Why is shiny stuff so pretty ?

Just posting this out of interest : PAC meeting tomorrow for those who are already in . Is anyone else interested ? 
I have decided < PROPFIRST>'s late birthday present from me is a sheet of steel . 
Tell me when I'm gonna live again , tell me when I'm gonna breathe again ... 
What do you do with a drunked sailor ...? 
Off to Youth Group ! 
Is bored . \ 
Observation of the day ; Waiting around either sucks or is amazing . It also may result in boredom . 
SNOW !!! \ 
( Just for you , < PROPFEMALE > . :P ) 
Interesting day . Lotta stuff happened that was slightly unexpected . Still trying to decide whether or not to go to Sadies if I don't get a date . Still owe < PROPFIRST > a piece of steel , too . 
I smile to myself when life's beauty reveals itself to others . 
Irony is a fickle mistress . Guidance is my prayer . 
Today was good to me . I hope tomorrow is even better . :) 
Has decided that , even though he wants to go , he will not be attending Sadies unless asked . 
I know what I believe inside , I'm awake and I'm alive . 
Is hoping today will be amazing . :) 
I was right . Today was amazing . Getting to see old friends from across the continent is fun . :) \ 
But no pics , so I'm pretty sure it didn't happen . :P 
My brother has a level 69 Scizor that is naughty in nature . I'm not sure if he should level it up or not ... 
The next time She says she isn't good looking/attractive/etc , I'm telling her she's gorgeous . :) 
So .... I figure that by now the chances of Sadies for me are fairly low , so I'm brainstorming ideas for what to do that evening with a group of people . 
is going to the Sadie-Hawkins dance . :) 
Life is good . This has been the best day I've had in months . Thanks to everyone who helped make it special . :) 
Almost Maine is SO FREAKIN ' CUTE !!!!!!! 
Set Build day was successful . Playing tetris with platforms is rewarding . I am officially tired . The only thing I can think of that would have improved today would be friends & a bonfire . :) 
We cannot banish dangers , but we can banish fears . We must not demean life by standing in awe of death . ~ David Sarnoff 
Is wide awake at 9:40 on a Sunday Morning .... something is wrong with this picture .... 
is stoked for Sadies . Now I just need to take a quick trip to the bank ..... 
is having a horrible day . :( 
So ..... I think I'm a fat man at heart . I just drained half a can of whipped cream on one piece of pie . and ate it . :) 
Off to youth group ! 
\Spell it right or I kick you in the hemroids . \ " Heck of a motivational speech from my uncle to my cousin . " 
And now it is left up to the waiting game . 
Opening night will go great . I'm sure of it . 
Tonight's show went soooo great !!! One night left . :) 
Sooooo ..... anyone else who's involved in theatre feel at a loss for what to do now that there isn't any rehersal ....? 
From the < PROPMALE > itself , comes the handle for the axe . 
Take yourself to higher places . 
Movie Night !!! XD 
Seeing happiness appear before me , even if long overdue , plays dancing smiles across my lips .

Okay , so what's the big idea ? There were bomb threats at THS , BMS , and some sort of security issue at BHHS . Either I'm crazy , or I'm seeing a conspiracy .

Who would be a good advocate our of the THS staff for a Senior Presentation ? 
I need to come up with something for my Senior Presentation . Theatre and CNA ( networking ) experience are highlighted in my resume . I have pretty much nothing but BSing my way through it . Anyone got any ideas or something they want me to do during my presentation ? 
I now know what a flügelhorn is . The Jazz Concert was amazing ! Praise be to the THS Jazz Band and the THS Notables !!! 
Now that it's finally safe to muse about this ; did anyone else encounter a relatively pranks free April Fool's Day ? 
A final thought before I take a several hour-long stroll in dreamland : Would Lady Gaga's Halloween costume be jeans and a T-shirt ?
