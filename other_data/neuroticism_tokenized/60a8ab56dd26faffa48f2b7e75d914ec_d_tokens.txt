Dear Illiterate Rappers , \ 
My whipped ice dairy drink brings the attention of many males to my place of residence and/or employment , and they declare that it's quality far surpasses that of yours . Absolutely , it far surpasses yours . I could convey to you the recipe , but I would have to demand compensation . \ 
Sincerely , The English Language 
looking forward to the show this week . then the spring concert in may . hopefully my choice for my senior solo will come out great . 
And so ends the class of 2011's run of theatre productions as cast members at HJSHS . Words cannot describe how sad I am that we're finished . You guys are like my family now and nobody can take away that bond or the faith we have in each other . ILY guys
