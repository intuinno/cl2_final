It's a boy !! 

Have caught a cold or my allergies are all out of wack :( I think I am going to have to break down and call the doctor 2morrow . 
So went to the Dr. this morning . Not a cold after all . Woke up with white blisters all over my mouth . Guess it has something to do with my pregnancy . Like I didn't have enough to worry about all ready ! Oh , and locked out of my house !! What a day 
Finally got in the house =] Waiting on < PROPMALE > to get home then going to < PROPFEMALE > out with Tiff for a little bit =]

Spent a long day at the hospital in < PROPMALE > for < PROPMALE>'s surgery . About 17 hours or longer . It's been a very long exhausting day . 
Just got home from the hospital . Spending time with my hubby then bed . Back there again 2morrow . 
Really needs to get up and do some packing so the drywallers can come in and start working before our little boy decides to make his presence in this world . Times going so fast !! 
The house will be all ready 2morrow for the drywallers . They start on Tuesday . On a not so bright note the Dr. called today and my levels are up which is not so good .

I loved you the minute I knew I was pregnant . I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and I fell in love some more . You were only a minute old & I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside your body . Put this as your status if you have children you love more than life ? 
Never made it to the laundry or < PROPMALE > yesterday so maybe better luck today 
It's been a busy day ran some errands this morning then me and < PROPMALE > spent the rest of the day at the pool with Nate , < PROPFEMALE > and Miya

ATTENTION : The group asking everyone to change \ 
their profile pictures to their favorite cartoon character is actually a\ 
group of pedophiles . They are doing it because kids will accept their \ 
friend request faster if they see a cartoon picture . It has nothing to \ 
do with supporting child abuse ... and violence , IT'S ON TONIGHT'S NEWS 
is drained ! Please tell me my wonderful son will start sleeping better soon 
< PROPMALE > took his first few steps :)
