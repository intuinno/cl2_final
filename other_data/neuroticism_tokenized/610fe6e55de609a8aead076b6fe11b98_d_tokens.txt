if everyone cared and nobody cried if everyone loved and nobody lied if everyone shared and swallowed their pride then we'd see the day where nobody dies And I'm singing Amen I , I'm alive 
I have no special talent . I am only passionately curious . 
some days aren't yours at all . they come and go as if they're someone else's days , they come and leave u behind someone else's face and it's harsher than yours , and colder than yours ...

No , this is how it works . You peer inside yourself . You take the things u like . And try to love the things u took . And then u take that love u made and stick it into some , some else's heart . Pumping someone else's blood . And walking arm in arm , you hope it don't get harmed . but even if it does , you'll just do it all again ... 
lo que < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>' ti , nadie te lo quita

My mom has made me laugh :) ... Wiped my tears ... Hugged me tight ... Watched me succeed ... Seen me fall ... Cheered me on ... Keeps me going strong .... and drove me a little crazy at times ... But moms are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever ! Put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful mom whom you love ... I love my mom ?
