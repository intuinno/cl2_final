is being attacked by a two-year-old ... but what's worse is that she can't seem to figure her life out . What a pity . 
Oh and I know this of myself : we've listened more to life's end gong than to the sound of life's sweet bells . 
I hardly have people that I needed to know . You're the people that I wanted to know . All this scrambling ' round hunting high and then low , looking for a face , love , or somewhere to go ... I hardly have places that I needed to go , cos you're the places that 
is high and superfly . <3

I want you to tell me what you've always really wanted to tell me , because tomorrow is not guaranteed , and who knows if I'll be dead and gone ? Just say what you need to say . Please .
