Happy new year ! One more year until 2012 . Enjoy it just encase xD

Okay , I'm going to Redding early in the morning , so I'll try to charge my phone and call you < PROPFIRST > . I miss you ! 
How do I change my birthday ? I put it in wrong =( 
Summer break !! Finally <3 
What the heck ! 87 notifications ?!?! :O 
I saw Avatar the last air bender the other day ... don't waste your money on it guys ! It was really bad acting , and the lines were very corny . The special effects were good though haha ;) 
Lol my brother tells me I'm half < PROPFEMALE > , so therefore I have half a soul hahahaha <3 
Yay I'm now certified for adult/child/infant CPR ! So ... if you go into cardiac arrest around me , I'll have a 40% < PROPMALE > of saving your life before the paramedics try :D 
Goin to the beachhh <3 
Okay , well I was supposed to leave for LA on Monday , but my mom wants to leave now ! \ 
So sudden :( oh well , gotta go pack ! I'll be back in a couple of days ! :D 
It was a pretty quick trip ... \ 
I wanted to go to Lake Arrowhead too :( \ 
But it was really fun visiting Pismo , and San < PROPFIRST > Obispo ! (: 
Packing for camp ! :D 
Leaving for camp ! I'll be gone for 5 days without a cell phone ! :D 
Paintballing was soooooooo much fun ! I have welts and bruises all over , but its all good :D I wanna go again !! Anyone wanna come paintballing with me ? :P 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > Arrow camp . I wish the camp could last longer , like a few months ! :D 
Wow . I was watching a movie when my dog < PROPMALE > started barking at me to follow him , and he was acting sooo weird like he was angry ! So I followed him and he took me to the garage , I opened it ... he dashed out after some guy that had been in our garage trying to steal something ! Darn it ... I wish Vixen was there , she was in the backyard :( 
Vixen just tried attacking a man that was just jogging by our house ... she actually tried to take him down ... luckily I got there before she did too much ... she got one small bite on him and it was bleeding . I'm so glad that he isn't going to report it unless it happens again . She might be put to sleep . I can't stop crying :( 
Wow can't believe that tomorrow is my birthday , it actually feels like this past year is equivalent to 2 years ... so much happened . Good and bad . :) 
Just got back from Bilancio Salon ! I have bangs ! :D 
Just saw the Expendables , it was pretty good . Schwarzeneggar was in it :D Gunna go to the Black Magic event in Corte Madera at the Gap store tomorrow morning , first 50 people in the store get a free pair of black jeans :D 
I saw Inception with my friend < PROPFEMALE > ! I've been waiting < PROPFEMALE > long to see that movie ! It was a great movie , and it wasn't really hard to follow along , the end kind of threw me off until I thought more into it lol :) 
Leaving for Sacramento now :D bbl

Look at your status . Now back to mine . Now back to yours . Now back to mine . Sadly , yours isn't mine . But if you stopped posting about other things and made this your status , yours could be like mine . Look down . Back up . Where are you ? ......... You're on Facebook , reading the status your status could be like ! Anything is possible when your Facebook status looks like this one ... 
If you really love something set it free ... if it doesn't come back it wasn't meant to be . 
Have you ever had a small bug sit on your computer screen and your first reaction is to try and scare it with the cursor ? 
Can't wait to go to Pismo Beach and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > after :D 
If a mute person burps , does it make a sound ?

Stupid cancer .... We all wish to have a new car ... A new phone ... To lose weight ... A person with cancer only wants one thing ... To fight cancer .... I know that 97% of you guys won't put this on your wall but 3% of my friends will .... Put it on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer or who's fighting cancer . 
Let's see who truly reads my status ... You and I wake up in a police car together . Using FOUR words only , what would you say to me ? NOTE : if you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status so I can comment on yours as well . Be a good egg and play along . ( 4 words are harder than you think ) 
Dear people that spread bad gossip , nasty rumors , and poor judgement , \ 
Please , grow up . 
Finally summer break is here ! ( : 
Like this and I'll tell you what I think about you :) 
< PROPFIRST > Roller 
People that post 5 times a day .... no one needs to know what you're doing every hour . Sheesh . 
< PROPFIRST > Roller . GUESS WHAT I JUST FIXED ! 
Happy 4th <3 :) 
Like this and I'll describe you in one word . ( or atleast I'll try to lol ) 
It all ends today . So excited , but I don't want it to end :( 
Judgmental , gossip-spreading adults . I thought they were supposed to grow up along time ago ?

Oh and < PROPFIRST > Kizyma IF SHE CAN MAKE IT <3 
Planet of the Apes was amazing ! I can't criticize anything in it . 
Can anyone tell me why its so hard to pray , but easy to swear ? Why clubs are growing and churches are shrinking ? Why its so hard to repost a christian status , but easy to post some gossip ? Why we can worship a celebrity , but not Christ ? You gonna ignore this ? Christ said , if you deny me in front of your friends , I will deny in front of my father . Re-post if your not worried about what your friends will think .? 
COPY THIS IF YOURE BRAVE ... I cant lie , for the next 24 hours inbox me a question and I will answer it honestly .
