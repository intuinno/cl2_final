I love my new wife in Christ ! 

Blessed with my family , and my feathered girls . 
Mudding , taping , sanding , don't wanna go back to work tomorrow but ...... 
I love my family- each and every one of them no one more than the other , and will go to whatever lengths to help and protect EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM . It's MY job to be the sacrificial lamb and I am gladly willing to fill the role ! 
Headed for the fair .... run run run but I love it ! It's great to have a couple days to have us all together to do something ... everyone set their alarms and call me in the morning , gotta make it to Grand Island from < PROPMALE > by 7am to open the store ! 
Back from the fair ..... I HATE CROWDS it's good to be home , still trying to get the chlorine out of my sinuses from being dunked in the pool .... I love my son 
Keep you egg cartons !!!! We need them chickens crapping out eggs like diarrhea !!! Also you need some -- a < PROPMALE > a dozen , still a little small but VERY yummy ! 
Still in Omaha with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > , family is family , < PROPFEMALE>'s mom is my mom , I love them all ! Keep the prayers coming God is looking after us , hope everyone is home safe and sound soon . 
Feeling like crap ... can't breath feels like i'm drowning .... this sucks 
Ok Huskers won ..... good job need to play all 4 quarters next time ... I'm tired , open the store tomorrow up and at it at 5 . Up side is I get to spend the evening with my family :) 
Taking care of the farms and folding laundry .... what every devoted husband should do ..... watch your step don't walk in the elephant poop ! 
Another day done . 
I'm glad my < PROPFEMALE > is feeling some better ... just hope the doc has good news 
Well off to Iowa for a couple of days ..... yee haw ..... I guess setting up is better than working the actual opening .... gonna miss the family ! 
Looking forward to a weekend with my < PROPFEMALE > ! Happy anniversary < PROPFEMALE > , a year has never flown by so quickly !

Is thankful for all of Gods gifts , I love my wife , I love my family , and I love life !

Missing out on moving day because of this stinking snow !!! I love you all back home ! 
Another grand night at the Orscheln Inn .... I should have asked for extra towels . 
Well , no day off , worked anyway to make up some hours for later in the week . Saying a few prayers for my mother-in-law , she's going to be just fine but could use a few reinforcing prayers from friends if you could take a moment < PROPFEMALE > and I would be grateful . 
Llama detail ... sitting in the yard with < PROPFEMALE > lawn chair out umbrella up < PROPFEMALE > at my feet ... all thats missing is a beer . Next week we take the wraps off to check the knee ... hope all comes out well < PROPFEMALE > is a tough girl .

Back at the fair and walked the barns .... something just dawned on me I havent heard once \Whats that smell ? \ " thinking it was a good idea moving it to Grand Island " 
3 more hrs then a long weekend .... what to do ... what to do . 
Life just keeps getting better and better ..... 
To my dearest Splash : I know even though it was 11:30 at night and you didnt know the dog would jump out from behind the barn , my broken nose is healing nicely . I will be back out to feed you again tonight just maybe no hugs for a couple of days . 
Ever have that pain in the butt fly in your face you just cant kill or that irritating itch that just wont go away ? 
Looks like the pesky fly is back ..... 
Damn flies are back again .. might need to spray 
Thinks facebook should have an `autolike` button would be very time saving for profile stalkers . 
Sitting beside < PROPFEMALE > in our cars @ lunch trying not to make eye contact 
Yesterday was not a good sad day . 
Someone get the < PROPFIRST > of the trucks that ran over me this afternoon ? 
Good game Packers !.... well the last 5 downs is all I caught ... but they were pretty awesome downs !!! 
Thank you for the bday wishes , I think I am officially approaching ' old man ' status extremely quick , guess I better stock up on depends and dentucreme . 
ok our < PROPFEMALE > Shade site needs 25 likes before I can set up a separate user name .... asking for likes so i can get it up and going ! Thanks !
