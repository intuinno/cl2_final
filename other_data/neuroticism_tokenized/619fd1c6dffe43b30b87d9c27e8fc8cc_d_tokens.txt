According to the Republicans , the left's new social health care plan is to send a ninja into your grandmother's ICU in the middle of the night to murder her with a dull bread knife so they don't have to pay for her . Anything I'm missing here ?

“But with dogs , we do have “bad dog . ” Bad dog exists . “Bad dog ! Bad dog ! Stole a biscuit , bad dog ! ” The dog is saying , “Who are you to judge me ? You human beings who’ve had genocide , war against people of different creeds , colors , religions , and I stole a biscuit ?! Is that a crime ? People of the world ! ” “Well , if you put it that way , I think you’ve got a point . Have another biscuit , sorry . ”” - < PROPFIRST > Izzard 
Is babysitting , watching The Adventures of < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > with lil brother . 
Oh wonderful ! Health care reform has been stiffled by indecisiveness yet again ! No health care for me ! Oh , and to top it off , congress is throwing more money into the abstinence only-sex education program , which everyone knows is proven to work ! What a great day ! \Sarcasm is the last refuge of the modest and chaste-souled when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded . \ " -Fyodor Dostoyevsky " 
OH MY GOD . LIVERPOOL LOST TO SUNDERLAND BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID FAN WHO THREW A FREAKIN BEACH BALL ONTO THE FIELD !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Got the sniffles from being a moron thinking \oh it's only like 35 degrees tonight ! I can handle a 90mph motorcycle ride in that with summer clothes ! \"" 
\We build too many walls and not enough bridges . \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
< PROPFIRST > Izzard on BBC at 10 tonight ! 
' s babysitting & watching the aristocats . 
Here comes the sun , here comes the sun , and I say it's all right . 
Just burned himself on a stick of incense . 
We don't need no education 
Facebook has a poke button , but why not a stab button ? 
My aunt sent me the Twilight series for Christmas . Do I dare read them ? 
bol'shie goroda . pus < PROPMALE > e poezda . ni berega ni dna . vsyo nachinat ' snachala . kholodnaya voyna . i vremya kak voda . on ne soshyol s uma . < PROPMALE > nichego ne znala ..... 
Republicans beware !!! Communist health care legislation has been passed . Soon , commies will come to your door and steal all of your freedoms via your health insurance !!! The U.S.S.A is here !!!! 
Waking up at 5:30 every morning to ride to G-ville in the freezing cold for class for the next 4 months is going to kill me .... 
is going swimming today . How was it so crappy yesterday , and yet today it is < PROPFEMALE > and amazing ? 
and the state of the union is ?????? 
quoted from time , \millitary spending was $750 billion in 2009 . Thats 6 times the amount for education and 26 times the amount for humanatarian aid and assistance in the same year . \ " Thoughts ....? " 
organic chicken on a bagel with provolone + chai tea = sucess . 
Just went for a walk down to the lake . My little dachshund got into an epic battle with a tortoise . I wish I'd had a camera . 
\Most of one's life is one prolonged effort to prevent oneself from thinking . \"" 
Thinks it is extremely Ironic that he is doing a self change project for psychology that he was supposed to have started two weeks ago . It involves recording a specific behavior over a two week period in an attempt to change it . Irony stems from the fact that the behavior he is writing about changing is procrastination . 
Condolences to the families of the poor souls who perished in the Moscow metro today . The world is with you . 
War is Peace . Freedom is Slavery . Ignorance is Strength .

sliced his foot on a clamshell :( 
The new < PROPFIRST > Hawking show Into the Universe is great . Watch it . 
Got absolutely soaked after an ill conceived and very cold ride through the rain . 
Please put this on your status if you know , \ 
or are related to , someone killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish for 2010 is\ 
that people will understand that the Rebel Alliance is a band of \ 
terrorist scum . The Empire wants only to bring peace to the galaxy but \ 
these rebels continue to kill our brave brothers in white ... 93% won't \ 
copy and paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one \ 
hour ? 
Made a 100% on my first exam for Politics of the Developing World ! :D 
Lost my voice a few days ago . Got it back yesterday only to lose it again instantly from screaming at a flobots/crash kings/paper tounges concert . Nonetheless , had a great time with some great friends . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > vs . Uruguay game = Fail 
\Why dont you go get a motorbike helmet and a matress and go play pretend\ 
Slava Serbija ! Great game against Germany ! 
North Korea epic fail XD 
Wow Italy , wow . Not only did you not advance past the first stage , but you finished last in a group that included New Zeland . FAIL !!!! 
Like my status if you think Twilight is shallow , is sexist and promotes misogynist thinking , is full of one dimensional characters lacking any of the characteristics of real people , and has no real storyline other than a girl obsessing over the physicallity of a guy who is actually kind of a douche . 
Every time I watch the Germans play they seem to get more and more amazing . It's like watching Brazil when Pele was still playing for them . It's incredible . 4-0 vs < PROPFEMALE > in the quarterfinals . 
Congratulations to Spain on their first World Cup title . The spirit of < PROPFIRST > Franco smiles upon thee . ( masks dissapointment ) 
Memories are bittersweet . \ 
The good times we can't repeat . \ 
Those days are gone and we can never get them back . \ 
Now we must move ahead . \ 
Despite our fear and dread . \ 
We're all just wishing we could stop , but\ 
\ 
Life goes on . 
Loves how the government and all the right wing chicken hawks are whining about WikiLeaks releasing the classified documents pertaining to Afghanistan . Guess they must not like it when facts don't agree with their little agendas or profit margins . 
\Blind faith secures its own perpetuation\ 
Finally got himself a computer . It's a < PROPFEMALE > Inspiron 5100 and it weighs like 15lbs . 
Is loving his classes this semester . 
R . I . P Shoya Tomizawa and < PROPFIRST > Lenz . The world has lost two young , talented and promising riders . 
Gainesville made it on to BBC world news ( the most watched news programme in the world ) because of those Dove church Christian bigots and their Koran burning . Way to go people . Our community is now world famous for being a bunch of intolereant rednecks . 
Well , the bigots whimped out of burning their books . I knew it was going to happen . I refuse to comment any further , however , as my last post already started a flame-war that has taken many lives and has ravaged teh internetz . 
Quick question everyone . Do you know who < PROPFIRST > Revere is ? If so , you are smarter than every single one of the people in my government class sans me and the professor . ( yea , of 35 people I was the only one who had ever heard of him ) 
Had a spill on my bike today . I mangled my forearm , knee , and the left fairing on the bike . I'm still walking though(barely ) , so everything is okay . 
My arm and knee both look and feel like I left them in a frying pan for a few minutes . :(
