At the ER with Grandma . Looks like she had a stroke . 
They are keeping grandma in the hospital overnight to run more tests and do am MRI in the morning . She doesn't think anything is wrong with her but she is still mostly incoherent . 
Grandma is getting better . She knows why she is at the hospital now . She even laughs sometimes when she can’t say something . No apparent motor skills damage , just speech . The Doctor thinks she will be near 100 percent in a few days . 
The Doctor is releasing Grandma to a rehab facility this morning . The arm wrestling will begin shortly . 
The rehab facility is picking up Grandma at 2:00 pm today . She is scheduled for 12 days of rehab . 
Grandama is going home Thursday . 
Just got Grandma home . 
Thanks everyone for all the Birthday wishes ! 
Is trying to wag more and bark less .
