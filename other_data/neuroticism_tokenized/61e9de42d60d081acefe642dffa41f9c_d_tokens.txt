What it all comes down to , is that everything's gonna be quite alright . I've got one hand in my pocket and the other one is flicking a cigarette . 

One love , one blood , and one life ! 
Why create when it will only be destroyed ? Why cling to life , knowing that you have die ? 
Praise be to the LORD my Rock , who trains my hands for war , my fingers for battle . Psalm 144:1 ( NIV ) 
Our heart stops for a second everytime we sneeze . Maybe that's why sneezing feels good , because even for a second , we become numb to the pain our heart carries .

Good Luck sa mag Nursing Board Exam ! 
I asked for STRENGTH and God gave me DIFFICULTIES to make me STRONG . I asked for WISDOM and He gave me PROBLEMS to SOLVE . I asked for PROSPERITY and He gave me both BRAINS and BRAWN to WORK . I asked for COURAGE and He gave me DANGER to OVERCOME . I asked for LOVE and He gave me TROUBLED people to HELP . I asked for FAVORS and He gave me OPPORTUNITIES . I received NOTHING I WANTED , Instead I received EVERYTHING I NEEDED . 
“Patience is bitter , but its fruit is sweet . ” - Jean-Jacques Rousseau 
It's the little things you do that can make a big difference . What are you attempting to accomplish ? What little thing can you do today that will make you more effective ? You are probably only one step away from greatness . 
Maraming salamat sa bumati sa akin noong x-mas at b-day ko . God Bless and Cheers for this coming new year ! 
Happy New Year ! 
Abandon your fear . Look forward . Move forward and never stop . You'll age if you pull back . You'll die if you hesitate .

Congratulations sa mga pumasa sa NLE ! 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . 1 Corinthians 13:47 HAPPY VALENTINES ! 
God sometimes frustates are own plans . We head in one direction ; He blocks our way . Finally we become content to go where He direct us . Is God frustrating your plans ? He may be trying to lead you . Be open to His will and sensitive to His guidance , and He will use you and bless you . 
Sometimes I do what I want to do . The rest of the time , I do what I have to . 
It's the good advice that you just didn't take and who would've thought it figures ? 
That is why , for Christ's sake , I delight in weaknesses , in insults , in hardships , in persecutions , in difficulties . For when I am weak , then I am strong . 2 Corinthians 12:10 
Ars longa , vita brevis , occasio praeceps , experimentum periculosum , iudicium difficile ... The < PROPMALE > is long , life is short , opportunity fleeting , experiment dangerous , judgment difficult . 
Is there an indelible line dividing sanity from insanity ... Or do they\
