I don't understand . why ... 
does anyone else's parents deny it when they do anything mean to you ? 
What is wrong with them ? They hurt and they stab at our hearts and our minds . They twist and turn our insides until we bleed and bleed . But they are nothing to us . They can't touch us because they are so insignificant . They are too small to even hurt us . We are pure souls that can't be affected by anything but what we wish to be affected by . We choose our destinies , our fates . I have chosen my fate . 
even or odd tomorrow ? 
Ask me anything http://formspring.me/cthyko

Inception + IMAX = YES 
My brain's turned to jello and my knees into butter . my head is full of flies , and I'm afraid that I'm a nutter . 
damn . I got that stupid apple bottom jeans song stuck in my head . it's because of that aidan < PROPMALE > . -.-; 
I have no peace in my heart . Only restlessness and the wait for tomorrow and the days after . A wrinkled brow , a straying thought . Squirming theories and thoughts and worries and reactions . I can only hush the dull roar of my own mind for a single fleeting moment . And it returns to the familiar current of thought that fuels my ordinary madness . 
< PROPFEMALE > is a fucking virtue . 
ain't this bugger freakin ' adorable ? \

? And you will believe in love and all that it’s supposed to be . But just until the fish start to smell and you’re struck down by a hammer .? 
I'm a little obsessive compulsive greedy stupid lazy self-absorbed mean bitchy nice fair-tempered angry polite cheerful pissed off crazy calm uptight depressed gluttonous hyper all-over-the-place , but usually I'm good-natured . 
I think no matter what you do , you can't always be comfortable . At some point in your life , you have to experience being uncomfortable , pain , frustration , injustice , loss of self , self-disappointment , shame , fear , regret , anger , speechlessness , and inexplicably unpleasant emotions . But you endure the pain like your favorite main movie character . How else would you get a happy ending ? 
?.?

I have a dream in my heart and more love for you than you can imagine . ? 
she ( not any of you dear friends on facebook ) always blames me for doing something wrong when I didn't . she always plays her damn piano when I'm trying to talk to her . she yells at me randomly all the time . and when I try to say sorry , she gets more angry . she ... is impossible to deal with . if you were trying to make a deal with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > il to disassemble his bombs , it would be easier than trying to have her be nice . 
DOGGY , WHAT DO YOU WANT . >:[ ]

I should go outside more often . What do people do when they go outside . See friends , right ? What else do they do ? Or some type of hobby ... I should get a hobby that forces me to leave the house . But I can't leave the house because I need a ride . Maybe I can find something to do that I can walk to . I know , I'll go to the park . I'll go to the park with my dog and read something . Both of us would benefit from going outside .

Put this as your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by pandas . Pandas are nearly unstoppable , and when hungry , also breathe fire . 71% of people won't copy this into their status because they have already been eaten by pandas , 28% are hiding in their showers with fire extinguishers awaiting the coming pandocalypse , and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post . 
IVC , your unnecessary restriction on files in your database is making me hate you . Your internet is awesome . But your file saving options are not .
