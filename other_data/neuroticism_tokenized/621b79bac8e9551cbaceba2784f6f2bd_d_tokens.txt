Where there is a will , there is a way . And because the sun rises everyday , that gives us hope to run and live free , and dance in flowers with bumble bees . Everyday is full of hope and fun , so enjoy life today under the sun . Dont let one rain cloud ruin your day , because you create your own way . (: ~ Me (: 
If it was meant to be , then you would be with me . And if together we are not , then the battle has been fought . So dont lie to be like me cause i will set myself free . Away from all your tricks and lies , and it will be your demise . I will stand strong and tall , and to the ground you will fall . All because you lied to me , thinking we were meant to be . ~ by Me (:

And tonight you will be on my mind , even though I wish you will be mine . ~ by me
