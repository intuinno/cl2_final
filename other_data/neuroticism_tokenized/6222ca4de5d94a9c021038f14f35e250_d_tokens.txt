Haven't slept since since yesterday morning ( like a boss ) lolol 

\This town will be the downfall of us all \"" 
S'pose I'll start sharing images . Eventually I'll even take photographs of myself 
Losing many things 
Man facebook chat is garbage 
The menagerie\ 
expands . 
Relived I can only seem to experience so much turmoil in a day . 
Going to mow a lawn . ? 
H ? e ? ar ? that ??? 
Guess I'll continue this trend of menagerie expansion . 
( Unliked ) That see who views you profile wants you to do surveys , which need your cell # to text you the results . Even if you play the game and ignore the spamware the installer throws in , it takes you to a < PROPFEMALE > where you have to sing up and put this thing on your FB profile and it tells you who clicks that how often . Junk . 
If I could , you know I would\ 
If I could , I would\ 
Let it go\ 
\ 
This Desperation\ 
Dislocation\ 
Separation\ 
Condemnation\ 
Revelation\ 
In temptation\ 
Isolation\ 
Desolation\ 
And so fade away\ 
To let it go\ 
I'm wide awake\ 
Wide awake\ 
I'm not sleeping\ 
Oh no 
So I caught a very interesting fish today ... 
What happened ? There was like 10 things that < PROPFIRST > liked . 
I forgot last night , so I'll upload a good one . 
Either I just missed < PROPMALE > or FB chat is to blame 
Status character limit of 420 , read the comment . 
( Yawn ) Another day , More life . 
They never showed any affection , \ 
to anything but your ego . \ 
A tragedy of errors at the best of times . \ 
You are everything , that's wrong with me . \ 
You are everything that I despise . \ 
You are everything I dreamed would die . \ 
You are everything that fades away and slowly dies . 
Everything Dies , \ 
EVERYTHING DIIIIIIiIiIiEies\ 
Everything Diiiiiiies\ 
Everything 
I guess I'll change the bird . 
Oblivion relapse . Hours melt away . 
A truth that's told with bad intent , beats all the lies you can invent . 
Trolling wont never dead ? 
I still ent run out . This one's good . 
Someone posts something , it says see 2 more posts from this person . I click on it and it just disappears . I also see stuff disappear then reappear , and stuff appear twice and one copy disappears . Fuckin ' facebook 
I'm going to be here until we make this right = we're going to spam these commercials until our stocks go back up . 
I was tired , now I'm restless . Guess I'll play more Oblivion ???? ¶§ ? 
I'd say ... In order of most to least annoying . \

Any critiques ? 
New bird , or mammal , or missing link . 
I turn 19 tomorrow . 
I'd say 75% of likes these days are fucking stupid . 
A new day , a new age ... Calls for a new hybrid . 
Thanks everyone :} 
A < PROPFEMALE > for Disease 
I guess this is a good opportunity to attempt this in a positive light . A fine present from everyone would be to finally begin addressing me normally . Caveman served its purpose 3 years ago when I went to DISHS as a good handle , but is now catalyzing my social alienation . Actually I've despised its abuse for many months . I don't expect perfect results , but I'd rather not resort to the opposite of my 1st sentence . 
I love this time of year when it gets cool and the flavor of fall is in the air . 
I'll have to get some more , this is the last one I have right now . 
Is again caught up with Bleach , the anime at least . 
I'm beginning to hate facebook . It's sadly the best way to communicate \ 
casually with people who aren't close enough ( physically or \ 
relationally ) for you you to see in person . It collects information \ 
from everyone and advertisers can use this to their advantage . 
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo . All of a sudden .... \ 
FFR IS BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
??? \Life for you's been less than kind 
Bitches don't know bout mah OVERHAUL MOD 
< PROPFIRST > . Yeah . What a fucking crock of shit . Way to respect the letter of my word while completely dishonoring the spirit of my request . 
Implying you can talk your way out of this one . 
\In the world of tomorrow's dreams 
reconsidering going to school in January 
\Life is a waterfall 
Going to DC this weekend . After that , I'll be around . 
Back ... but I can't go anywhere > : E 
D2'n it . 
Vote losers . Good luck Cali . 
Of course this country's too fucking useless to vote an intelligent decision about weed law , even in California . 
(+[ ]-: -)\ 
:] \ 
I like my PSP 
Just a reminder to you kids that after over 18 months of downtime , FFR is back in full . 
I'm just taking this opportunity to explain that I'm just taking this opportunity to explain that I'm just taking this opportunity to explain that I'm just taking this opportunity ... 
( british voice)going over to my good chap's camper for a spot of tea 
Cloudy with a < PROPMALE > of smoke rings . 
Nothing is perfect , but everyone tries to be in some light . 
IEAIAIO WHYYYYYY\ 
AND WE LIGHT UP THE SKYYYYYYY 
It's rumored the PSP2 will rival the 360 in terms of power . They haven't even designed it , though .

I was getting high-runes all through my dream , but I think they were all made-up ones lol .

To put it lightly , and as an understatement , your opinion counts . 
Mmmmmmm stuffing :] 
Rectify this , Eldritch ! 
Sometimes the shitiest music that sucks has touching , meaningful lyrics . 
I hate feeling torn . 
haha Murderchu 
Meatwad make the money , see

24 of you are still befriended with a spam < PROPFEMALE > . 
Fuck . 
All generalizations are false . 
I know some of you kids can recognize this shit . 
Of course nightmare Mephisto doesn't drop one rare item . 
The cartoon thing was supposed to peak tomorrow . Oh well . 
I saw more padittles on the way to Windsor than i think I've ever seen before . 
Goodnight faceplace 
The trend may be over , but my nostalgia isn't . 
Yesterday , killed Mephisto in hell , today , ate at the Mephisto's Grill restaurant . 
Facebook often fixes things that ain't broke . \ 
This is my view of the ' new profile ' . 
Back . In one month , I'll be in northern Maine . You have this window of opportunity to see me so please take advantage of it : > 
Practically any substance used with the proper moderation is potentially beneficial .

Woke up an hour ago . Suddenly my sleeping pattern is eary again . 
Horrible driving . 
I like that the character limit in a status is 420 , but I wish it were higher . 
I wish I could share the music in my head with people .

I'm hanging with < PROPFIRST > the Beautiful Ninja , lmao . The neighbors internet is slow but I WILL PERSEVERE 
is going to Northern Maine . What a fucked up dream I had . 
When people have nothing go wrong for a while , their standards change so they get upset with something that they normally wouldn't . It's particularly bad in small towns where nothing bad happens compared to large towns and cities . 
Watching a movie 
There's something calming about the snow falling . Lulling . The wind makes it fierce , but the snow falling is serene . 
I had 1200 points on snake , and I HIT THE SHIFT KEY . 
Its 4:12 and what is this ? 
Herpie Halodays 
Ugh , I ate like 4 dinners yesterday . Hell of a night . 
? \ 
I did my best , it wasn't much\ 
I couldn't feel , so I tried to touch\ 
I've told the truth , I didn't come to fool you\ 
And even though\ 
It all went wrong\ 
I'll stand before the Lord of Song\ 
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah ? \ 
? Hallelujah\ 
Hallelujah\ 
Halleluuuuujah ? 
We were talking , \ 
about the space between us all , \ 
and the people , \ 
who hide themselves behind a wall , \

Makin stavin snow forts with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > 
I now communicate with more caution where I used to interact with more awesome . My awesome must have burnt out over time . But I still have a grasp . Along with this my thoughts veer to the conclusion that not feeling judged is probably the healthiest thing for this . 
There is the truth . THE truth , trust me , there is . Perhaps one of us knows it better than all the others , perhaps none of us is even close . But it's there . I am trying to search for it . Not the entirety , that's too ambitious , but one piece at a time . Always keep open the possibility that what you take as true may not be . Keeping all possibilities open but knowing only one is actually true , that is critical thinking . 
Goodbye 2010 
I'm not quite leaving for good tomorrow like I thought . I'm only leaving for a couple days then in a few more days I'll leave for a long time ... 
Made it back from orientation . My roommate signed up for on-campus housing accidentally lol so as of now I have no roommate . I'm leaving on the 9th I think . 
When music I like gets stuck in my head , it's often for days . 
Good game 
Much can be communicated through eye contact . 
Watched < PROPFEMALE > a while ago . Hadn't seen it in years . 
I'm going to miss everyone loads , more even than I already do . 
This seems a good < PROPMALE > to get caught up with Bleach again .

Anyone wanna Skype ? 
Marble Blast Ultra son ! 
I had a dream in which a few of us were chilling in a small private jet playing videogames and shit . It was awesome . 
Jammin out playing Rock Band , wondering who tried to call me among other things ?

You seem to take premise to all of these songs ? \

No , no it can't be . NOOOOO !!!!! \ 
ANOTHER BLEACH FILLER !!! \

Ethics reading seems enjoyable enough . Though the Sociology book is big and fat , it's not even close to the OSHA book of General Industry Regulations , that book promises to be the most boring by far . The English book is small , not so much as Ethics , but it is . English seems like the most homework though , and is far from my favorite subject . 
How can I be so tired after sleeping so long ? 
\New profile 
? This is my name , I'd like to reiterate that Caveman is not my name . Don't call me Caveman . 
mfw Richardson comes back to the internet , rapes my profile pictures with comments and tags : -I 
Apparently you can play snake on youtube if you pause a video at 0:00 and hold the right arrow and press the up arrow . wtf I just played snake on youtube ?!? 
Woke up feeling lousy , probably because Richardson and I ordered a \giant\ " bacon and peppperoni pizza last night . " 
EVERY TIME I play snake right now it lags hardcore and I die > : E 
Ugg I feel like crap . < PROPMALE > I can't call you I can only call local .

Lunar eclipses happen many times a decade . Last year's was the first one on the winter solstice since like 1638 I think . An eclipse on a solstice is what made it special .

What a fucked up day in a fucked up week . 
So there I am , visiting a large cavern system I tapped into digging out my base , thinking I had explored the whole thing , when I saw a small opening up toward the ceiling . I wielded my pickax and chinked out steps . It lead me to a large room with lava , water next to it , gold , redstone , so much obsidian . I had to find my way out and < PROPFIRST > the path back so I could craft an iron pickax to get those precious metals :]

Sure there are tons of times when dislike would be great but can you imagine how many arguments would start if people could dislike each other's statuses ?

With no telepathy to rely on , we must rely on symbolism to convey concepts . This is what language is . Words serve to communicate thoughts , but such symbolism is limited in its capacity for artfulness . Words can be beautiful , and powerful , but they can never be as beautiful as music .
