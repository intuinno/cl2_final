\In dreams and in love there are no impossibilities . \ " <3 (: " 
' I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that \ 
you can learn to let go . Things go wrong so that you appreciate them \ 
when they're right . You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust \ 
no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better \ 
things can fall together . ' <3 (: 
The couple that fights the most is the one most in love ... it shows they\ 
care enough to notice the other one screwed up and care enough to \ 
mention it to the person so they can fix it . When you stop fighting it \ 
means you stopped caring . <3 (: 
do you miss me a little bit , or do you miss me a lot ? <3 (: 
I'm well aware of the problems we have , but does that mean we should just let go of everything , and lose ourselves babe ? One life , one heart , one love , one GOD , trust in the Lord , he is good .! ( :
