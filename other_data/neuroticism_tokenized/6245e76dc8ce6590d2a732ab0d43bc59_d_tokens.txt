Hands , like secrets , are the hardest thing to keep from you . Lines and phrases , like knives , your words can cut me through . Dismantle me down , repair . You dismantle me . You dismantle me . ~ Anberlin

If you would like to join our jamboree , there's a simple rule that's compulsory . Mortals pay a token fee -- rest in peace , the haunting's free . So hurry back , we would like your company ...

Studying is so hard when there are 57 and 1/2 other things I'd rather be doing ... 
Homework's in , project's done , and I even got some R&R time . It's been a good night .

So what's it gonna take , silver shadow believer ? 
Really wants to go dancing tonight :) 
\Night falls . I fall . And where were you ? And where were you ? \"" 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now .

Bei mir bist du schoen ... 
I want another good night sleep like I had last night ... Yawn ! 
Only 3 more days ! 
Looking forward to this weekend ! I SO need a vacation . 
A < PROPMALE > \Hurrah ! \ " for dancing and hiking this weekend . " 
The weekend was definitely not long enough ... 
Baby , crank it up (!) , until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck . So listen , < PROPMALE > , when you're feelin ' kinda low , let me tell you where to go , TURN ON THE RADIO ! 
Listening to the rain falling , I've found , is one of the most pleasurable sensations in the world . As is dancing in it and literally feeling the < PROPFEMALE > on your skin . 
is glad to be home . 
Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Leave the picture up until Monday ( December 6 ) . There should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . Do this as a peaceful protest against violence towards children . 
All dressed up to go dreaming ... 
\ ... something with a little more edge and a little more pain ... \"" 
I have just spent the last two hours playing Facebook's version of \Boggle\ " . I now have the pleasure of playing host to a worn out brain and the stunning realization that I really need to get a life LOL . " 
Wonders what to do for her first adventure of the week ... 
On to the next adventure ! It will probably be the Wakiki Aquarium or hiking < PROPFEMALE > Head . I'll get to both , it's just a dilemma of what to do first ! 
Random story for the day : Walking back to Waikiki from < PROPFEMALE > Head and did a double take as < PROPFEMALE > Claus waved to me from a blue < PROPMALE > . I mean , we are talking full beard , red suit , shiny black boots , hat , < PROPFEMALE > cheeks , bowl-full-of-jelly , the whole works . If anyone tries to tell you < PROPFEMALE > is just a myth , tell them he's real , and living in Hawaii . Mele Kalikimaka . 
Will post rest of vacation pictures at a later date . Just not tonight . 
Is going to completely and purposely overload herself on dancing this week . Cures everything , right ? LOL . 
I finally got my printer working ! I haven't been so excited over technical stuff in , well , ever . 
This is gonna be interesting ... 
What an AMAZING weekend ! And , as a side note , grapefruit juice = delicious ! 
French toast + moscato + good book = perfect Friday night . 
Experimenting with insect communication involving pheremones , we held termite races today in class . Mine finished first and won me a chocolate bar . Go entomology !
