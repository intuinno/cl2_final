It is not a question of your environment or those around you , nor what the organization or leaders may be like . To be swayed by such externals is pointless . It all comes down to one person : you . What matters is that you become a brilliant beacon , shining with joy and happiness and live your life with confidence and courage . If you shine with a radiant light , there can be no darkness in your life

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile
