will the snow ever end ??? 

when your world is breaking , how do you keep it together ? 
and so it's another day ... 
* yawn * ... still tired 
yup , so it seems sleep is again , out of the question ... 
so i think the day has finally come to an end ( after 21 hours ) , only to begin again tomorrow ... which i'm sure will come all too soon .... 
my head is in pain , my world is continuing to spin , and i don't think it will stop soon 
world is slowing slightly , but things still just aren't right ... 
yup , i was quiz happy today ... and the posted ones aren't even half ... 
there are times that i love the fact that i'm a hermit ... 
i'm just so happy that it's the weekend ... 
now that i finally got my stupid internet to work , i'm a little happier ... 
not overly thrilled that i worked an extra day , but the overtime will be nice ... 
Yay ... time for bed again ... 
thumbs up to the weekend ... thumbs down to loosing a good work < PROPMALE > ... 
bed time for everyone .... ok , well at least for me ... 
Just got home from the wedding and it was beautiful .... Congrats to you , < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > ... 
Can't figure out why I'm so tired ... 
I'm thinkin it's bedtime ... 
time to chill and then head to bed ... 
* blows raspberry * ... yup ... that's my thought process right now .... 
For some reason , I seemed to have seen , dealt with , or spoke to all the idiots at work last night .... ugh ... I hate Mondays ... 
my weekend will consist of cleaning and finishing the show I've been watching ... 
eo'd out so it's time for a nap ... 
well it's the weekend and i'm not sure if it's gonna be any good ... :(

is not happy about only having a 2 day weekend from now on .... stupid people .... ggrrr 
has the strangest sense of CPR < PROPFEMALE > vu ..... and has decided to finally go for my I cert .... 
I ... just .... L ... O ... V ... E ... days .... from .... HELL ..... 
I hate when weekends end ... 
Don't you just hate it when you get attacked by toilet paper ???? 
can't help wondering why it is that when you want to sleep , you can't and when you can't sleep , you want to ???.... Sucks don't it ? 
itchy foot .... 
has a meeting in the morning and I hope I can still read ... 
is glad I'm on the downhill side of my week ... 
Does it make you wonder when cats take over your bed and then look at you like they're gonna murder you in your sleep for waking them up ??? 
* yawn ... * 
have you ever thought you felt your brain melting ??? 
seriously thought about hitting someone pretty hard , just to get hit as hard back ... 
wonders why the unkown is always more facinating ... 
was stalked by a cat in the parking lot at work last night ... 
is pissed that I have to wait another 2 frickin weeks ... Stupid ass people ... 
has remembered why it is that I dislike school ... stupid homework ... 
ewww .... snow already ... me no likey ... 
found out tonight that I prefer the straight blade over the curved blade .... 
...................................................... 
* sigh * ... let the week from hell begin ... 
Yup , the week from hell , is going along so effin well , can't you tell by the \smile\ " on my face ??.... " 
So , it's one day down ( very long and very boring ) and now I get to go sleep so that I can do it all again tomorrow ... 
Well , the end has come .... and now it's time for the aftermath .... * sigh * 
meh ... yup ... oh and being sick sucks ... 
is it just me , or did christmas sneak up on anyone else ??? 
I'd rather go back to bed than get ready for work .... 
I got the dummy sticker at work yesterday and today , well , all I can say is , death to the evil slot supervisor hobgoblin .... 
I realized something tonight : I like shiny things . So men's butt's must be made of silver ... 
wonders why Mother Nature has it in for us and refuses to let it get above 40 degrees ?? 
is worried about my brother ... he's down in Haiti right now and I just hope that he's alright ... 
had a good time last night ... it was what I needed after I had to spend hours calculating drip rates ... 
is glad that my brother will be home this afternoon ... 
stupid fog ... stupid , stupid fog ... 
needs a pincushion that won't cry ... any takers ??? 
wonders what kind of junkie I'm gonna look like by the time I get to work later ... 
my bruises look like shit ... 
when your heart wants nothing more than to fall on the floor , why is it that your body won't just let it happen ? 
is glad my class is almost done ... 
has been up for about 31 hours and is now going to go to bed ... 
* yawn * 
meh ... yea , that says it all ... meh 
When life throws punches , you just gotta stand up , keep your hands up , and fight back ... either that or get your ass kicked ... 
feels like crap ... 
enjoyin a 3 day weekend ... 
drunks are fun when they're friends ... 
is getting really tired of all the snow .... 
is going to st < PROPFIRST > with some friends tomorrow ... 
is sad that my weekend is over and I gotta go back to work tonight ... 
1 down and 4 to go ... 
2 down ... 
so , I just got offered day shift ... Should I take it ??? 
Decided to stay on graves for now ... 
feels like someone hit me in the face ... 
may still feel like I was beat , but the meds make it all better ... ;) 
woozy feeling making the world go round ... 
tis the weekend ... what joy it brings ... 
being sick is bad ... 
has been pondering something ... If you met an alternate version of yourself , do you think you'd like who they turned out to be ?? 
stupid snow ... stupid slushy snow ... 
i hate long days ... 
wonders why it is that on the odd occasion I'm in a really good mood , everyone gets all freaked out ??? 
now realizes why I was all sorts of crazy yesterday .... 
had a great time tonight and realized that I need to see some people more often ... 
wonders why some people have to wear pants so low that they are showing ass cheek ? 
Can't help , but to still be confused by the strange question a guy asked ... Why would someone ask me about running over pedestrians ??? 
Can't help but to feel like when I'm sick , whatever it is , has complete control over my life .... ggrrr 
Has realized that I'm a very self destructive person ... always doing things that I should never be doing ... 
I really dislike not being able to sleep ... grr ... drives me bonkers ... 
is kinda aggitated , but also a bit grateful ... it's an odd combonation ... 
So , state test is in a few hours and I'm hoping it goes well ... 
Well , I passed my practical , now to wait on written result ... 
I'm stupid ... stupid , stupid , stupid ... did I mention stupid ?? 
When will the shit just stop piling up ??? 
I PASSED !!!!!!!! I PASSED !!!!!!!!!!! 
needs a few good swift kicks .... anyone up for helping with that ?? 
has realized that sometimes the worst thing for me is the hardest thing to keep at arms length . 
wonders why the trials we go through in life have to break and destroy us to the point that we just want to give up ?... just because you feel the pain , does it mean that you're really alive ? 
feels like my legs are jelly ... 
really hates packing ... 
really hopes that today is better than yesterday ... yesterday really kinda sucked ... 
Oi ... the crap I put myself through ... 
It's always an adventure when you get to save your friend from suffocating in her own tits !!!!! 
So , what happens when life hands you lemons and you don't want lemonade ?? 
They say when you talk to someone you get to know them , well I've been talking to myself for years and there are days when I still don't know me .... 
It's hard to know how to say no when yes sounds like the better answer ... 
when you know the right course to take and you choose to take a different course , how do you get yourself back on the right course ?? 
How can you not cry when one of your best friends is leaving for basic and you won't see them for months ?? 
Meh ... yup ... that's what I think of life right now ... 
It wasn't too great at work last night and I'm hoping it's better tonight ... 
Last night was better ... and today was even better ... and tonight should be a good time too ... 
Is ready for bed ... 
Can't seem to help doing stupid things ... oi ... 
Got moved and now to unpack all my junk ... let the fun begin .... NOT !!! 
About got my ass pummeled by a semi on my way home ... the anal dwelling monkey changed lanes while I was right next to him !!!! 
can't seem to figure how the most innocent of comments can lead to the dirtiest of thoughts ... 
I got a call from my JoeJoe today !!!! 
wonders why is it that some memories make you smile , some make you cry , some seem like they haunt you , and some just fade away like they never happened ...? 
I was moving at the speed of sound ... Head spinning , couldn't find my way around and ... Didn't know that I was going down ... Yeah , yeah ... Where I've been , well it's all a blur ... What I was lookin ' for I'm not sure ... Too late , didn't see it coming ... Yeah , yeah ... 
Take , take your time ... smell the roses , but steal the vines ... Don't wait for the hands of time ... To second guess and change your mind ... 
Love and other moments are just chemical reactions in your brain ... And \ 
feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in your veins ... \ 
Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine ... I'm gunning\ 
down romance ... It never did a thing for me ... But heartache and \ 
misery ... Ain't nothing but a tragedy ... 
And I dont know which way to run ... And I feel myself coming undone ..... Know that there will come a day ... When it all comes falling down ... I just cant walk away ... 
There's a voice inside my head ... Sayin ' you'll never reach it ... Every step I'm takin ' ... Every move I make feels ... Lost with no direction ... 
But I never knew ... That nothing's ever as it seems to be ... When a dream collides with the reality ... 
The path that I'm walking , I must go alone ... 
Wondering why we bother with love , if it never lasts ... 
Vacation starts right now ... I have off until the night of the 25th ... WOOHOO !!!! 
Thanks to you all for the birthday wishes ... 
Finally got to see The Sorcerer's Apprentice ... not bad ... 
Lifestar Symposium day 1 is about half over .... 
Day 2 is over ... it was pretty damn awesome !!! 
Ugh ... I don't really wanna go back to work after this vacation ... 
feels like passing out , but is worried that I won't sleep for very long ... it's taking time to get readjusted to my work and sleep hours again ... 
I hate when I need to sleep , but can't ... it's driving me crazy !!! 
* sigh * ... yup , that about sums it up ... 
I'm not quite halfway through my week and something has gone wrong each day so far ... I wonder what will happen tonight ...? 
Got my stuff done today ... now all I have to do is wait to get it all gone ... 
The moment is wrong , and no one is right ... 
FML ... REALLY ?!?!? AGAIN ?!?!? W .. T ... F ...?!?!?!?! AAARRGGGHHHH !!!!!!!! 
Damn busted ass ankle ... grrr 
Off to get my car a check-up ... it's past due for one ... 
Have you ever felt as if your brain is melting ??... 
ick ... I hate being sick ... 
Feeling better , but still not great ... I guess I gotta medicate more ... triple dose Nyquil here I come !!! 
stupid being sick ... I wish I would just get better ... coughing until I feel like puking , yeah , just what I need ... ugh 
Ok ... this cold is officially pissing me off ... it can't make up it's mind ... either go away or incapacitate me ... I'm tired of back and forth !!! 
So , today's the day ... I hope , anyways ... I don't know what I'll do if they put it off again ... 
Well , it's offical ... it's done and over ... 25yrs to life ... * sigh * 
Meh ... moods were up and down today and it really wasn't a bad day ... dagnabit ! 
I hate when I wake up and I have a headache already ! Why can't my headaches wait until I've actually used my brain or smacked my head on something ? 
Sometimes , I think my cat has brain damage . He'll run around like something is chasing him and then all of a sudden just fall over on the floor and start rubbing himself on the carpet . He then gets up and walks away from the spot like nothing happened . 
Yup , my cat is officially mental . He sat with me this morning chewing on his own tail and making himself cry ... repeatedly ... 
I've decided that I like Obama just a little bit more now ... 
WOOHOO !! I got me an xbox finally ... 
Chillin with my joejoe ... gonna miss him when he leaves ... 
Weekend is almost here ... goin to a concert and havin a late christmas with friends ... woohoo
