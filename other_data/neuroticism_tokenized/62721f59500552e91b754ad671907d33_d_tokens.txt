After reviewing my wall , i realized that a lot of people wished me a happy birthday without knowing what exactly i did on my birthday . On my 21st b-day ( aug 4th ) i spent it in afghanistain ( which im still here btw ) fighting a war that probubly all of you have been watching on the news during this summer sometime . 

My unit is 2/8 < PROPFEMALE > if any of you want to look up some pictures , because i am told i was caught in a couple of them ( hope they got my good side XP ) Maybe if some of you are interested , i will share the memorable story that happened on the 4th of August . Im almost back in the states so hit me up anytime ........ 
Lots of people say that i look like eminem .......... heh heh guess it all works out cause hes a pretty cool guy . 
Relationships are overrated . Yeah thats right , i said it . So all you people that are freaking out because you dont have a < PROPFIRST > or a bf/gf , or anything like that , psh you dont need that crap . And for you peeps that are in a relationship , that sucks to be you . ( Married people are of course the exception to this ...... rant . =D ) 
Still feeling a little < PROPMALE > over from last night , and have to get things ready for this week ( aka laundry , orginizing gear for possibly checking out of 2/8 , and switching to desert camis ) 
Checking out , and feeling tipsy . watever , man 
mmmmmm percocet . Operation went well , no problems . Just chillen out eating some ice cream and enjoying my \sick days\ " XD " 
The leave ( aka vacation ) was tons of fun , and very relaxing , not too stressful ( with So Cal , theres gotta be a little craziness right ? ) and was very grateful to see/hangout wit a lot of my friends and family still . For those of you that i did see , trust me , no matter how short or long we < PROPMALE > out , it was awesome . No doubt about it . For those i didnt get a < PROPMALE > to see , no worries , ill be home in Nov for good ! =D

To all my brothers : happy veterans day . It has been a great honor to fight by your side , an honor I will never forget , and will always < PROPFEMALE > .
