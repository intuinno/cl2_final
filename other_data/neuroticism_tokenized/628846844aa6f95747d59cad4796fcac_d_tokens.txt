Okay , it's two days after the fourth and I still haven't eaten any BBQ and the only fireworks I've seen have been from the car as we drove by . Hopefully I can convince my mom that we absolutely must set fireworks off in the street or else my dog will eat the neighbors . : I 

Fighting off the fourth summer cold I've had this break . Sneezing on everything is not what I wanted to do for the next couple days . *_* 
I think that last year was always less complicated ... 
started watching < PROPFEMALE > Trek The Original Series ... It's amazing how many reasons they're coming up with for Captain < PROPMALE>'s shirt to either be taken off or ripped . XD Am I the only Trekkie ? 
is drinking chocolate syrup . Best decision i've made in awhile . :D 
Spock , my laptop , died Friday of last week . It's some sort of problem with his hard drive they think ( I don't know , I don't speak fancy computer talk ) and they might just send me a new computer . T_T I'm sad to see Spock go , but I can't wait to see if I have a Spock Jr. coming ! 
I can't boil an egg without burning my fingers and at least one foot , but I can cook porkchops , make a great omlette , and fry up perfect bacon . Actually , I can't boil an egg at all . As I tried to hobble over to the sink to rinse water on my burns , I knocked the pot and the egg cracked open against the side of the pot . XD 
< PROPFEMALE > just flipped onto her back dancing in a neon orange onesie . My life is complete . \ 
\It really hurt . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > " 
Being sneaky makes me giggle . :) 
Listening to the always fun Daft Punk ! \ 
\ 
There's not much I know about you\ 
Fear will always make you blind\ 
But the answer is in clear view\ 
It's amazing what you'll find face to face ~ ! 
I'm ready for summer vacation to start . Right now would be great . 
can't stop listening to \Killing In The Name\ " :) " 
Study study study . Get distracted by shiny internet . Study study . Eat delicious frozen lemonade . Study study study . Start chasing the dog around . Study study . Get up and dance to favorite song . Study . Update status . Give up on studying . 
I feel refreshed from my nap in 8th period ... However , I can't seem to decipher my notes ... 
Louisianime was awesome thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > ! Plus , shout out to < PROPFIRST > , Spanish dude , and Conner ! 
\I am no man's bosom ! \ " Anyone else love Adventure Time ? :) " 
is listening to Christmas songs , because , really , there is never a wrong time for the Christmas spirit . Unless it's block period american history and someone has gotten the song \Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\ " stuck in your head . :) " 
Just finished watching Invictus ! Teared up at the end like the big sap I am and flailed at the awesomeness of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! :D 
Just stuck a pound cake in the oven for my dad's birthday . I almost lost an eye on the cake pan . XD Don't ask how . Other than that , I think it's gonna turn out great . And yes , batter did fly everywhere at one point . :) 
So ... totally forgot about the TAG field trip today ... It was cool though . 
I am so focused . Gonna get all my homework done and stay ahead in all my classes ! Nothing's gonna distract me tonight ! And , no , this post does not count as a distraction . :D 
Just got back from the National College Fair Thingie . I am now convinced that there's the perfect college for me in Arizona . And another perfect one in < PROPFEMALE > . Which also has a campus in < PROPFEMALE > . :/ There are way to many choices and options and decisions to make . I'm glad I went with my adoptive sister ; it was a lot of fun with her . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Got my first set of ions almost memorized , my essay for history almost done , my dialectical journal almost finished , and the fifth chapter of Overachievers almost read . :) 
I need to protect my oscillating fan from < PROPFIRST > Hasselhoff ! ... but I don't use Norton ... 
Just watched Ironman 2 . Ah ... today is a good day . :) 
The irony of the stress I'm feeling trying to finish reading Overachievers does not escape me . :| 
Phew , only about 95 pages left in Overachievers . I'm completely determined to have it finished today .... I still have a bunch of stuff to do though . Every time I take a break I feel like I'm such a lazy slacker , that I should be getting tons of stuff done in those fifteen minutes when I update my facebook status . :) 
Today was a good day . :) \ 
School tomorrow is going to ruin this euphoria , so I'll hold onto it as long as I can . \ 
But seeing all my wonderful friends will be amazing ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , I have one word :\ 
Snuggies 
-insert witty status update here- 
We're doing Wonder Boys tonight ! XD\ 
I can't wait ! :D 
Chinese food makes for a happy Andi . Plus my last exams are theatre and aerobics . :) 
is baking a cake again ! :D Best part about baking a cake ? Why licking the batter of course ! 
I'm using my strobe stick ( lol) !! :D Lady Gaga and strobe sticks go so well together . 
< PROPFIRST > Bartlett came in the mail today ! :D Can't wait to watch < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr and < PROPMALE > Yelchin in action ! < PROPMALE > Yelchin is my new favorite actor under 30 . XD 
My legs are killing me and I have the sniffles , but I love < PROPFEMALE > ! And I am eternally grateful to her ! 
I like milk . I like chocolate milk too . But strawberry milk is nasty . 
I'm just gonna say it now so , hopefully , I don't get as many questions tomorrow about my costume . I'm gonna be < PROPFEMALE > from Tarzan . Only the ' I'm on a deserted island ' < PROPFEMALE > , not ' I'm from England ' < PROPFEMALE > . I put the costume together literally five minutes ago . I have a monkey to < PROPFEMALE > around too . :D 
m&m's the < PROPFEMALE > of champions ! :D 
Just saw Red , and I must say , it was HILARIOUS and AWESOME and I LOVE ACTION/ESPIONAGE MOVIES !!!!!!! :D I totally got my fill of assault rifles for the day . Now I just have to wait for Due Date ...! 
hates webassigns ! :D 
I hate scary things , but I'll sit and listen to a scary story or watch a scary movie ... do I like punishing myself ? 
just saw Fantastic Mr. Fox . It's really really awesome ! And I love Ash and want to have a son just like him one day . :) 
Vallee Farms was fun ! But someone didn't wear their green shirt . : I 
Pleaseput this on your status if you know ( or are related to ) someone who hasbeen eaten by dragons . My wish for 2011 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% of people won't copy and paste this .. they have already been eaten by dragons . 
Mom always buys too much < PROPFEMALE > . We get , maybe , twenty trick-or-treaters on a good year . Well mother , what am I to do now , with a cauldron full of delicious treats ? 
Daft Punk has been playing in my head over and over for the past four days ! I don't know whether to be happy or start stabbing myself . In other news : METAL GEAR . D: 
Just watched Doom with < PROPFIRST > . Almost Judo kicked an automatic lysol spray thing ( a.k.a jumped fifteen feet in the air and almost pissed myself ) . < PROPFIRST > thinks I'm a wuss . That was some serious scary stuff , and I never wanna watch it again . But , it was hilarious ... XD I mean , I suggested that they have everyone evacuate and blow up the facility , and they did . After everyone had already been brutally killed . 
is finally home and going to shower then make some hamburgers . And maybe even do some homework . 
I want some silly string . Let's have a silly string fight . COME ON GUYS LET'S DO THIS THING . 
Dirty dirty < PROPMALE > dirty dirty < PROPMALE > beautiful ! Beautiful dirty dirty < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > bang bang ! 
Been dancing since ... forever . Sweaty , stinky , but < PROPFIRST > can now move hips a bit . I feel accomplished . Also jumpstyle makes my thighs able to crush a watermelon . Or head . Breaking out the new moves A-lunch Monday . Be there or be in fifth period ! 
Lock eyes from across the room\ 
Down my drink while the rhythms boom\ 
This song is stuck in my head XD 
Does anyone else do a little dance when everything seems perfect with the world ? \ 
Excuse my babbling , I'm eating a chocolate chocolate chip cookie accompanied with yummy lactose free milk . 
An inside look into the mysterious thoughts of Andi ( aka when I'm giggling randomly I'm probably thinking something like this ): \ 
I want a sweater ... but not now ... it's too warm ... But I want a sweater later . So I guess I want a frozen sweater . \ 
If you get the reference , I like you . 
So I was enjoying an interview with < PROPFIRST > Urban and < PROPFIRST > Cho when my dog vomits . So I snatch her to keep her from eating it ( which makes her vomit more ) and she repays me by licking my on the lips with her nasty vomit mouth . \ 
You know you're a dog lover when this doesn't disgust you as much as it should . :) 
How much wood would you < PROPMALE > if you were a wood < PROPMALE > ? 
Who's gonna make someone uncomfortable tomorrow ! * raises hand excitedly * 
I'm fighting fo my RATS ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and I just tongue wrestled over a piece of meat ! < PROPFIRST > you are missing the best sleep over yet again ! 
I can't find my headband !! D: How will people be able to tell it's me if I'm not wearing my white headband ? People will start mistaking me for < PROPFEMALE > !! XD 
because my dad doesn't listen to me , I have to work on our communication problems . I don't like it , but my mom simply said ' life isn't fair ' . Can't argue with that . :( 
Spock is being extra weird today -GAH I can't even think about it without picturing him and Precious !!! XD 
my parents left me cause I was running late . meh , story of my life . ;) 
I felt something weird against my leg and just pulled some crumpled tape out of my pants .... 
My breakfast consisted of 3 minute < PROPMALE > and cheese and a lot of coffee . My dessert consists of lemon crunch bundt cake and orange juice . Great way to start the day and a terrific way to end it . :D 
I have a sudden urge to nom nom on some brains . BRAINS ~ ! \ 
rawr ! (>X_X)> 
is thinking of getting into yoga ... 
Anyone else going to the play tonight ? 
can i rsvp while i'm sitting here ? well i just did . 
Cleaning the house and dancing in my pjs ! 
wishes The World Ends With You soundtrack wasn't quite so awesome so I could stop listening to the songs ! 
every time I try to start studying for chemistry , I fall asleep ! :O Sorry Ms. Vu ! I've suddenly become narcoleptic ! T T_T T 
Does anyone want to write an essay for me ? :D (<----- you know you want to pile this on with all the other crap you have to do today ! ) 
Poetry Slam was awesome , and may I give my congrats to everyone who read ! You guys were so good ! I think my hands hurt from appluading so much , but it was worth the sting ! :) 
I'm going to try really hard to do as little as possible today . But I know the house needs cleaning and I should probably get some form of excerise in . Thanks goodness for DDR . 
just finished . glad it's done . now i don't have to worry about it until my parents see my scores . :) 
So i was junpstyling on the wood floor ... in my yellow socks ... and of course I told my mom to watch my awesome skills and the second I start , I fall flat on my back , legs in the air . Behold my skillz . 
I've been more productive today than I have in a long time . I love singing loudly over the sound of a vacuum . 
Who you finna try ? Who you finna try ? \ 
I bet it ain't me ! I bet it ain't me ! I bet it ain't me ! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! 
I came really close to punching my neighbors while on the bus . They don't know who the BeeGees are and can't even name one of the Beatles . And then they said I'm not black for not listening to I dunno Usher or something . : I 
Did Ms. Vu post answers to go along with the study guide ? :/ 
I love how they state that a song is a remix in the beginning . It leaves no room for doubt . Now if only people were that way . :| 
Cleaning out my room . And when I say cleaning , I mean dumping trash , sorting paper , and scrubbing every surface known to me ! Look out dust , beware my wrath junk , YOU SHALL NOT PASS --- my inspection . ( Hahaha , lame attempt at puns ) 
just watched the end of Inception . I have one thing to say : AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! 
Not having to go to school has only given me more time to tear my hair out trying to raise my win rate in Spider Solitaire . 
is jamming to Daft Punk thanks to my brother . Thanks < PROPFIRST > ! :D 
is missing her DS , wherever it is . Come back to me ! I can't play Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box without you ! T T_T T 
They lost four or five crew members and still managed to have a happy ending . Eh , they were all redshirts anyway . 
Pandora decided to grace me with some Journey . I'm having way too much fun with this . :) \ 
Don't stop believing !!! 
Spock's been making some weird noises lately and I don't know if he's going through pon farr or something ... :/ 
My win percentage in Spider Solitaire went up by 1% and I'm so happy !! T T_T T 
How come every woman who has been involved with Captain < PROPMALE > knows the exact amount of time that they have been apart down to the day ? 
Kirk : Bones , I know a place , across town , where the women-\ 
McCoy : Oh yes ! I know the place ! Yes , I know the place . Let's go ! \ 
Hahahaha ! :D 
One More Time came on the radio after spin class . My day is officially satisfactory . 
Just saw The Green Hornet . I now want a friend like Kaito . XD 
Fried chicken and syrup . Nothing could possibly go wrong with this combination . \ 
Crap . That's what I thought about M . Night Shyamalan and Avatar : The Last Airbender . \ 
If we're going by that example , as soon as the syrup touches the chicken , it should explode into a fire that will take out a fifteen mile radius leaving no life to be seen . 
Just took a drive with my father in his car with Black and Yellow blaring and little to no attention to the rules of the road . But I got Starbucks out of it , so I can't complain . 
Watching Blades of Glory ... enough said XD 
Why am I such a Gemini ? I mean really . It'd be great if I could have at least one trait that they list that doesn't describe me perfectly . : I I love it , but I hate it . 
My hair feels so soft ! You wish you could pet it . :D 
Ugh , feeling sick ... just gonna chill and rest up and drink lots a fluids ! MAN UP IMMUNE SYSTEM , STOP BEING SUCH A WUSS . 
< PROPFEMALE > Nightkiss 
I like them fancy steppin ' machines ! \ 
I want to walk into an arcade and say that to the people playing DDR . 
Ugh , I give up on trying to focus and do english homework . 
I got chills ; they're multiplying\ 
And I'm losing control\ 
Cause the power you're supplying\ 
It's electrifying ! 
Last time I watch anything even remotely scary . I'm gonna have a heart attack jumping at my own shadow . Yep , not getting any sleep tonight . T T_T T 
sitting outside because i forgot my * insert your preferred expletive here * keys this morning . this day could be better . :| 
I hate math so much . I wanna go back in time , find it's mom , and punch her in the face . XD 
I'm literally melting in the stupid bonus room . Regret not bringing a ponytail holder .... too hot to walk downstairs ... please attend my funeral . 
is going to do all of her homework and cleaning duties so that she can go out with friends . CLEAN ALL THE THINGS ! 
Over an hour of studying for Vu's test Thursday . I'm getting a good grade on this if it kills me . :| 
just saw MysteryGuitarMan's McDonald's commercial . :D Yay ! 
Why homework ? Why do you insist on existing no matter how much I ignore you ? 
I'm a thinker\ 
I could break it out\ 
I'm a shooter\ 
A drastic baby\ 
I don't even play the game , but this song is stuck in my head . \ 
It's quite addicting ! :) 
THIS JUST HAPPENED\ 
Amber : Hey Andi , no homo , touch this , right here . \ 
Me : Um ... no ...? \ 
Amber : No , come on , I just want you to feel how hot it is . \ 
Me : Nooooooooooooooooooo\ 
Amber : Just put your hand right there ! \ 
Me : Okay ... -pokes-\ 
Amber : No , your whole hand ! \ 
Me : No ! I felt it ! \ 
Amber : No you didn't! -smacks my hand onto her- See ?!?!? \ 
Me : -sobs- ... yeah ... it's really hot ... T T_T T 
God is great . Nuff said . 
I opened a box of thin mints ... and I remember eating three ... and one whole pack is empty . Yep , someone better take these cookies away from me . :| 
So , trying to study for Vu's test tomorrow ... Anyone else freaked out by how easy this chapter seems ? 
just performed a running jump into my bed ... \ 
and flew off the other side . Good thing it's so close to the wall or I would've broken something . 
just gave Spock a cleaning ! Dusted out between his keys , dusted off his screen and wiped all the smudges off of his back . He's looking quite spiffy if I do say so myself . :) 
Got mys 417 deviantart messages down to about 339 ... and now it's up to 422 . Why do I try ? XD 
Don't you hate when there's a giant freakin bug somewhere , and you turn your back on it for literally five seconds , and then it's gone ? Like vanished . And it'll pop up randomly in like your toilet or something . Argh . 
OTL 
I LOVE MY MOTHER SO MUCH !!!!!!!!!!! SHE JUST FOUND MY BLENDING STUMP !!!! 
The best songs are those that don't last long enough . 
Saw The Adjustment Bureau ! Loved it of course . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is awesome sauce . :) 
Ugh , I feel like I'm gonna vomit . I ate a pack of nutter butters , a snickers , a reese's , ate three chicken strips from sonic and washed it all down with a caramel mocha java chiller and water . That my friends , constitutes my three square meals a day . :| \ 
I want some veggies . 
Go to your profile . The first 5 friends in the sidebar are your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
Okay , I got : < PROPFEMALE > Butler Perez , < PROPMALE > Osburn , < PROPFIRST > Hart , < PROPMALE > Marchand , and < PROPFIRST > Shumone < PROPFIRST > Henderson\ 
Definitely the opposite of screwed . Lets do this thing ! 
Grandma ( while pointing at my baby picture ): Oh , Andi ! It's a good thing you didn't turn out fat like this ! \ 
Me : ... thank you ? : I\ 
...? 
When I told my Grandma I don't like blueberries , she looked at me as if I had just said I was going to become a lesbian . And then told me to learn to like blueberries , because my life isn't complete without them . XD 
feeling like crap . Gonna sleep a bunch and smite whoever gave me this horrible cold . 
To Whom it May Concern :\ 
I just cleared out all of my email inboxes . There was too much stuff for me to go through , so I decided it wasn't worth it . Honestly . I'll try to keep up with emails from now on , but no promises ! :D 
I would just like to say that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is a great friend for taking me home today . :) 
Ring day was tons of awesome ! Loved it ! Love my ring ! Love everyone who went and cheered and clapped for us . Loved cheering and clapping for everyone else ! Woohoo ! :D 
Haha * trollface * this isn't andi ! 
What's done can't be undone , but I hate living with the consequences . 
blueberry 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
I woke up this morning like \What happened last night ? And why do I smell like jell-o and pond water ? \ " XD " 
Yeah I think you're hot , I think you're alright , but you're acting like a chick all the time ! You were cool and now you're not , just like that . When you grow a pair , you can call me back . ;)
