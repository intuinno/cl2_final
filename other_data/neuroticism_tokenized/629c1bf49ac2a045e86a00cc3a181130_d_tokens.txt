Yay giving in . 

Got new tires . visited band kids . < PROPMALE > out with family and then < PROPMALE > . I was productive today :) 
<3 s deuterium 
is for retro-engineering 
is for retroengineering . 
Polished her boots . And then realized that they both have ONE CRACK in the same spot D: they're dieing !!!! I will now polish them religiously . 
so I get to verify my FASFA all over again because they sent my tax info to SAC and not St Phillips . I'm not even fucking enrolled in SAC . Why would they send it there ? Somehow this is probably my fault , but I'm gonna point the finger anyway because they need to learn how to explain shit to people who don't know what they're doing or how to ask . FUUUUUUUUUUUCK . I'm so tired of this shit . I'm just gonna pay for it . 
Making okra . Delicious . 
Today , I helped a < PROPMALE > Miller customer . I helped them by telling them what time Natural Bridge Caverns closes . I told them 6 . Pretty sure I was right . 
Definately don't feel like cooking . But I should . Cause I didn't yesterday either . 
Best pancakes ever- add fresh/frozen blackberries and rasberriers . :D 
Charged with theft ? Killed a man ? Can't find a management position ? Don't worry ! Here at < PROPMALE > Miller Bar-B-Q , we love giving criminals positions of power . And don't worry . You only need a high school deploma cause if you were smarter than that , you wouldn't be here that long anyway :D * thumbs up * 
Also , I have found that Mrs. Freisenhahn likes either our tea or our food . She's been there twice in like 4days . 
So pretty much everyone has moved now . Kinda glad I didn't . But I'm excited for monday , even though I still don't know where my classes are and school starts soon o.O 
doesn't like the new Texas state ID :{ It looks like all the others now . 
College experience- classes were easier to find than expected . Classes can also be cancelled for the day without notice . Expecially the one you get up at 6:30 am for . And my ceramics class has a bunch of middle aged noobs in it . I'm the only one in the class who's worked with < PROPMALE > excluding the balding/graying black man who's probably in his 40's . What the hell ... 
It's already September ??????!!!!! I don't know whether or not to be worried about this =/ 
PS my phone is currently OOC . : > 
Obama pretty much just said shut the fuck up , the deficit was here when I walked in the white house . I'm not going to make it worse lol 
In case anyone wanted to know my free time , 9-4pm Tuesdays , 3-10pm Wednesdays , 1-10pm Saturdays . If you can match it , let me know :) 
The 1st and the 10th are homegames . Anyone down with meeting up there ? 
:) :( :(( D: >:[ > : @ 
Good bye , < PROPMALE > of the Hill . I will miss you . 
Oh thank you JISD , for free monies . 
< PROPMALE > tried to fix my glitching and I guess didn't finish so now I don't have ANY cable , phone , or internet . Thank god for < PROPFEMALE > :D 
workschoolworkschoolworkschoolworkschoolworkschoolworkschoolworkschoolworkschool 
Since when is there a girl Smokey the Bear ? Someone , please explain . NOW . 
Also , I wish someone would call . Then I could answer the phone . Instead of ignoring the telemarketers who call EVERY HOUR for my GRANDMA . 
Fuck . 
finally accepted my < PROPMALE > and realized that my tuition is pretty much paid for- at least the first 2 years . Holy crap . I'm excited . Now I just need to look a few things up , talk to my couselor for adding a minor , and stay in school . 
< PROPMALE > Marcum find me a house there . NOW 
< PROPMALE > Marcum < PROPFIRST > is trying to advertise but it wouldn't hurt to look- off of mccullough and hildebrand . Watchutink ? 
animal cops is on . this dog has a wire wrapped around it and the dogs skin is growing around it/ rotting in some parts and there are maggots in the wound . Delicious . 
wtf my computer restarted to install updates all by itself ... 
Walking with dinosaurs was AMAZING :D 
BUT THEN I remembered I said I'd work for sanchez , so I am NOT free for the rest of the day D: 
can't fucking sleep . I think at this point I would rather be pregnant . 
and just to bitch some more , I think I did something wrong to my should cause it's been hurting for like 3weeks now . Lovely . 
By the way , the Ren . fesitval was EPIC . I bought a long bow :) But it's too easy for < PROPMALE > . So I get to buy another one :D I'll put the little bit of pictures I took up later . 
Sexiest man alive = < PROPFIRST > Depp . How could you disagree ? 
Team Realistic Characters : I guess only < PROPMALE > makes the cut . Team < PROPFEMALE > Rice Characters ? I think so . Probably going to see it anyway 
I love listening to accents on NatGeo . 
I love getting off work and finding a note on my windshield using paper from IN MY CAR that says \Move your car Please\ " What the fuck ? I work there " 
So I still don't have my keys and had to use a spare that LUCKILY my mom had to get my car out of a church parkinglot . 
POOPS WITH THE SMELL OF 10,000 MEN ( my cat ) 
I've come the conclusion that I like guard , but I don't LIKE guard . At least , not enough to do what I did this past weekend for 2 and 1/2 months . And I got told maybe but probably not , which is okay . After crying when I got home because I had to go up the stairs in order to get to my room and take a HOT bath , I think I know what I'm NOT willing to do . But at least I found out and won't be left wondering . 
* drools * ramen noodles 
STOP SENDING ME FARMVILLE REQUESTS !!!! I'm not going to play it 
I have to do 3essay response things and 1 paper on whatever for earthscience ... Will pay someone else to do my work for me ? 
For the Farmville people : I read that the guy who invented that game is < PROPMALE > now cause you can actually spend real money to get in-game items . How many of you have actually done that ? 
Not doing my papers again . 
Oh sure < PROPMALE > gets snow , < PROPFEMALE > gets snow , but converse ? * shakes fist at sky * 
boo finals this week 
Philisophy final tomorrow . I should at least get a B . So glad none of my courses are writing intensive . 
Say yes to the dress ? 
Cat fight ? I think so . 
thinks she's getting sick =/ 
also , I'm schedualed for 38hrs next week . Which means I won't have to close more than once or twice or I'll hit over time :D 
not a prom night dumpster baby 
* throws tantrum * I needs to fix my internet cause even facebook thinks the Explorer I'm using sucks . But I'm lazy D: 
Play wow , wash some laundry , make dinnrar . 
pink&orange :D 
10,000 men !! >:[ 
also , I had a blister in my mouth f(rom a really really hot french fry ) that I messed with and now that area feels funny . 
awesome 5hr gap between classes that I'm trying to kill >:[ 
>:[ RAWR super angry face . I spilt perfectly good ramen juice on the one piece of carpet in the entire house except for the stairs 
< PROPMALE > De Los < PROPFIRST > \Does the fact that entropy is not conserved in the universe disprove time travel ? " 
is definately not doing her homework . And hasn't for a while =/ Oh well 
Virus = suck it up , you get no medicine . :( 
sneezing with sinus infection = big nasty mess =/ and music appreciation makes me want to throw the laptop on the floor . 
wednesday we'll finish moving :D hopefully I have a lot of cleaning to do . 
first time on the internet in a while :o 
Attention : If you've tried to text me or anything I lost my phone charger . It's so old that neither wal-mart NOR Bestbuy had it . It had to be ordered from online . I will send a mass text once I get it back . ( < PROPFIRST > that should answer your question :P ) 
ALSO : today I actually saw a Unitarianism bumper sticker . Was unaware they had those . 
D: Still no phone guys . Gotta call newegg and see what the deal is 
I hate being tired and not sleepy . I'm going to wake < PROPMALE > up by tossing and turning :( 
2 hours of dinosaurs on natgeo ! I'm in love <3 
ddrunk much ? 
ICECREAM TIME !!!! 
=/ 
I just pulled a cup out of the cabinet that was stacked and there was this peanut butter like substance on it that smelt like death . WHAT THE FUCK WAS IT ?!?!?! 
I love finding cat litter in the puppy's shit ... 
CAWCAWCAWCAWCAWCAWCAW 
DBareD 
cold weather flying or save for epic flying ? 
Cloud keeps knocking my water on the floor D: she must have a cup fetish ... 
Oh I wish I were a tardigrade weiner , that way I would be invincible ... Cause if I were I tardigrade weiner ...... 
got to work and left cause someone wanted hours and I only worked a 4hour shift anyway\ 
what to do with me time ... 
3minutes from boiling ramen noodles + crotch = 1st and 2nd degree burns . Never screamed so loud or so much . Random guy who lives in the apartment complex took me to texas medclinic . Thank you , random dude .

Yay laundry day . Double yay for being able to breath again :) 
Caw ? 
First time getting off early in like a month 
Got pissed enough that I put the puppy on the porch . Now I can enjoy uninterrupted silence . Hope she isn't retarded enough to jump off . 
> < 
Should I go on a status liking rampage ? 
Would play WoW but healbot pissed me off and I don't feel like deeps . Kinda hungry but have given up on getting comfortable . Any more tossing and turning might actually wake < PROPMALE > up . Awesome . 
Little more smart and a little less ass , ' sir ' 
Just realized I still have NOT seen the dinosaur exhibit at the museum . I am quite upset right now because I am scared it will close before I go >:[ 
also , I can now get on facebook with my phone and I don't know how to chat on it so that's why I haven't responded to most of you trying to do so with me . If that made sense . 
Why are 50% of the science shows about fishing or lame things like logging ? I am angry >:[ 
Reapplying sunblock to more than just my face and shoulders would've been a good idea yesterday . Texas coast will always be Texas coast so it was fun even though you couldn't see your feet after4 inches of water and fish would hit you . And sand . Everywhere . 
8-cl shift today :D 
So my 8-close shifter ended up being 8-11 2-close which ended up being 8-11 2-7 cause I sliced the corner of my < PROPFEMALE > off and had to go to Texas med clinic . 3stiches and lots of ibuprofen . And i got ther at 7:20 and didn't get out till like 10:55 . 
Nap time 
Curse Tuesdays . I actually have to clean on these days since there's nothing else to do :( 
The stitch through my nail came undone and now it's very tempting for me to pull it out so I can take that part of my nail off ... 
This is not twitter . I do not need an hourly update on your thoughts and feelings . 
My cat is a cockblock 
=\\ 
Ancient Aliens on the history channel . Same shit as always like the weather balloon and whatnots 
Why is starting a fire hard ? 
Maybe today < PROPFEMALE > will only potty outside 
Did my first ICC today :) no wipes on the bosses 
Hungry and can't sleep . Awesome . 
Walk the dog/ start getting ready for work/ pick up my mess . Yay ? Eh . 
8-915 today . Looooong day is looooong 
I've done absolutely nothing so far today and it has felt AMAZING . But I better get started so I'm done before < PROPMALE > gets home :) 
While I don't mind an 11-close shift I would appreciate it if you would stop scheduling me if I'm not needed until 1:30 >:[ 
This is the second time that I've filled out a change of address form in2 months for < PROPMALE > miller because the mail they send me is returned . More proof that I live in a black hole . 
Mr < PROPMALE > doesn't sound like the asshole he is when interviewing people . How two-faced . Lol 
Obama @ UT < PROPFIRST > @2 for anyone interested . 
Finally saw the dinosaur exhibit at the witte . No cool things in the giftshop to remember the occasion but a few pictures on the phone . 
How retarded is the dog if it doesn't even ASK to go outside when out of the kennel after a month and a half . How could it think that it's okay to shit on the carpet I just steam cleaned because of it ? 
I didn't get fired :) 
@ < PROPMALE > miller employees- does anyone have < PROPFEMALE>'s number ? 
It's still dark out :( 
Actually looking up catering prices today . Yay . Let's see who wins for food and price 
Kick ass maybe be > The Matrix . Is that blasphemy ? 
Power is out at work and it is HOT 
Format painter messed me up- just spent like $10 for use of a computer and printer >:[ 
Possibly 10hrs of overtime this week ? I think so . 
Day 1 of 6 done . Already have 10.28 hours 
Glad I cooked dinne 
Glad I cooked dinner 
Time to break in my muffin pan with some strawberry cheesecake muffins :D 
If you have to ask if I think you're stupid , you probably are . Just saying . Especially if I hardly work with you . K thanks ;) 
They probably won't show half time so I don't really care about tonights game . 
The porcupines are kicking my ass >:[ 
OM NOM NOM 
Blackhole :( 
I cried from a manflic last night . 
If a cow and chicken had sex , it would taste like shark 
The Spirit of < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Grombrello , where were you when I needed to walk my dog ? 
Here I am ... 
I sliced for lunch and did amazing :D 
If you got an invitation , there is a reason the response card is already stamped . We didn't buy twice the amount of stamps so you could send us a message on facebook . K thanks . 
The alarm keeps making a bird sound at random intervals . Weird . 
Just finished reading \Let the Right One in\ " which has a movie based on it coming out . It's weird . Movie will probably be < the book " 
Watching house :) . < PROPMALE > can't complain lol 
Thank god < PROPMALE > heard my alarm cause I sure as hell didn't 
I'm making you a cock from mah doo !

Carpet shark attacks again :O 
Went through the rest of my crap at my moms . I feel weird throwing 98% of it away but I've gone almost two years without so it shouldn't be that big of a deal . 
Ravenous 
I'm seeing , for the first time , a Jersey Shore episode . This looks like the dumbest fucking show I've ever seen . Like , there are no words to describe the lack of intelligence as the cast just argues and sleeps with each other in turns . How is this fun to watch ? I would never want to be around people like this . 
I feel yucky =( 
So I've thrown up 3x now . Feel like crap . Hope I'm better by Friday for saturday 
Everybody is watching Beauty and the Beast but me :( . 
>:[ I can't watch TV and don't know how to fix it >:[ 
So much shit to do today 
I will be < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Marcum in less than 12hours . 
Thanks for everyone who came :) . We had extra everything ; don't know why I was even worried . 
Lost < PROPFEMALE > Caves :D 
Every time I get on facebook on the actual computer I notice all these messenger windows . I don't get those on my phone so I hardly ever IM through here . Sorry if it seems like I'm ignoring you :( 
I hate corrective autotype . I'm tired of this fucking phone with all the toys on it . It pisses me off . 
Fatty fat fats had her woman parts removed :o 
Last day of vacation 
Jersey shore spoof lol 
Back to wark >:[ 
Boo can't sleep . Have to be up in like 5hours :( 
Ever After costumes make me jealous . 
We are one siding it during lunch and I'm making- fucking walk up asked if I could get their drinks ( they weren't getting drive through drinks so I was as fast as I could ) not only was the answer no , but HELL NO . Why are people so incompetent ? 
Fuse you finally are playing Eminem takeover . Thank you . Eminem from 5pm-1am . Lols 
Found a surprise in the laundry >:[ 
When you give Tavi a treat she takes it into her cage and puts it in her food bowl . 
< PROPMALE > Mill meeting at 9:45 pm 
Also those of you who want to meet up at 8ish tomorrow at taco cabana before hand are welcome to come :) . 
Yay clutch stopped working on the way home . Awesome . 
I should not own a vehicle . All of my friends- you are now required to live in biking distance . I know how to fix a bike . Not a car 
Make that 815-820ish for me . I'm eating late dinner 
Getting my car towed to < PROPFIRST>'s to get fixed . Yay . 
Clocked out with 40.01 hours . Lol . At least I'm off tomorrow all day :) . 
Stranded at wark D: \ 
Husband not answering phone and since I got off early no coworkers can take me home 
I just watched Tavi take a sock behind the couch . Now I know where all the socks are going ... 
Just had eggnog ;D 
Finally finished Under the Dome by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Good book and it didn't seem like he just flopped an ending on there so I'm happy :) 
After starting with $20 in quarters and doing laundry , I am left with $2 . Expensive ass laundry mat . Doesn't help that I washed 3 comforters ... 
Gotta be up in less than 6hrs ... 
Fire circle :D 
Work tomorrow at 8:30 am-5pm . 187 poorboys for a special order ? I think so . Boo . 
Micromanagement , here I come \/" 
Finally saw Easy A and it made me feel really awkward in a lot of parts . REALLY AWKWARD . 
There were only two people who actually put their name AND address in the guest book from the wedding . I don't feel like finding all of your addresses again for thank you cards which were written TWO WEEKS AGO but I didn't send them out because well , you didn't follow directions . So I have them in a box ready to send out if you feel like sharing your address again . 
So after we got home from Taco Cabana , we chill in the room for a bit . When we come out , there is soda EVERYWHERE on the table and the ferret is soaking wet . There is a soda trail leading behind the couch and sure enough , there is the ferret with the taco cabana cup dragging it to her stashing spot . I had to give her a bath . What a bitch . lol 
Who would be interested in playing minecraft with < PROPMALE > and I ? 
Stupid fucking dog ruined my ten dollar feather from the ren fest . Awesome . 
I'm am dead set on compiling evidence that the old testament is not to be cast aside . It is just as important and nowhere , IN CONTEXT , does Jesus state that the old testament laws are to be abandoned . But following those laws would be socially unacceptable . Anyway , my point is- I'm proving someone wrong . 
Also- if you believe you don't have to follow the old testament rules , quit picking and choosing which ones you like and saying \oh well we can follow these ones ( mostly because it's legal)\ " such as the 10 commandments and the oh so lovable Leviticus 18:22 " 
< PROPMALE > Potter and the Prisoner of Azakaban :D 
!!! I get to watch < PROPFIRST > Pattison die in the next two hours :D 
Worst day ever :( 
Two hours and twenty minutes til I'm off :D 
So thanks whoever sent those dishes under \0000000\ " for a name from walmart " 
Trying to kill the world with Pandemic 2 . Fucking Madagascar >:[ 
< PROPFEMALE > ham with carrots and cheesy mashed potatoes for dinner . You are all jealous =P 
< PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 1 : check . And it was awesome . 
Day one of three down . Next 13hr shift starts tomorrow . Actually went well today but I think I'm getting sick so I took some nyquil and will be waking up at 6:30 . See you guys later :) 
39 hours in 3 days : complete . Yay 
80+ hours and I can't go home . Shouldve called in 
Still kinda sick . Boo . 
Slow limo is slow 
So I had a < PROPMALE > Potter dream last night . And it was awesome . Except < PROPMALE > ruined it when he woke me up cause apparently I was talking . 
Hace frio . The high for today is 63 . Tomorrow's high is 65 I believe . 
< PROPMALE > almost made me throw up from his fart D: 
Can't sleep :( 
1- I'm twenty . Finally out of the \teens\ " . 2- why were some of you up at midnight and gave me birthday wishes then ? Good thing you didn't wake me up >:[ 3- thank you guys :D " 
Very cold hands from outside + warm water = pain for like an hour . And swelling . 
CATA CATA CATA CATA !!! 
RAWR login queue >:[ >:[ >:[ 
went from number 586 to 68 in fifteen minutes . I'm getting excited 
Actually off tomorrow too !! 
Only 9.4 million experience to go 
It's a good day when you come in and they changed your scheduled shift to end 3hrs earlier :D 
Just got a boy kitten a home . He was a cutie 
Super mad cause I can't find a god damn key that's supposed to be on the fridge and I wanted to shower and dry off with a warm clean towel dammit . 
Oh my fucking god fuck these managers . Seriously . How is it rude to get my food from around the customer when I waited for five minutes and am on a timed break ? YOU weren't even in earshot- I said excuse me before I reached in . You are such an asshole about the dumbest fucking things and it would give me pleasure to see you die . 
Just saw How to Train a Dragon . So cute :D 
Off for the evening and tomorrow . Life is good . 
Recently woke up and it already feels like nap time 
I'm killing my cat . And I'm not going to get creative about it either- I'm just gonna take her outback and shoot her in the head . 
Flight got cancelled so now tomorrow we have a flight at 5:45 am . Awesome 
Almost threw up . 1 more plane till Florida . Let's hope this one doesn't smell like fart the whole time >:[ 
How is babby formed ? 
It's entirely too easy to over eat now :( 
* cries * I work at 5:15 am Monday . What the fuck I'll have to get up at 4:50 am . 
For those of you who missed it , I'm pregnant . EDD is sept 1st but that'll probably change . 
Finally home with the animals and fed . Probably going to bed soon 
Im gonna turn into a fatty fat fats if I don't watch it ... But I'm always hungry and if I don't eat I feel sick D: 
Slept like crap and when my alarm went off at 5:30 am my stomach immediately did flips :( . Was just now able to convince myself I wanted a grilled cheese and a glass of milk but I had to fight to keep it down . This is stupid . How to pregnant people work ? It's not that I don't want to , but I have to eat very often or feel like I'm gonna hurl and pass out . Can't do that at BM :'( 
So going 6hrs without food and being sick for 3 of them was awesome . Thanks , < PROPMALE > Miller Management . Fuckers . 
OM NOM BACON 
I wasn't aware that I worked at < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s Bar-B-Que . If I had known that , I would not have applied . 
gonna cause some waves :) 
don't feel too hot today 
There's white shit on the ground . OHGODIDONTEVEN- 
I sure love me some sag wraps . 
Went home early from work and took a two hour nap . Feel better , but I fear I am fighting something . Boo 
I've figured out that chocolate covered anything upsets my stomach . Now the question is do I just throw up so I feel better when < PROPMALE > gets home or fight through it for two hours . I hate my stomach . 
Wind is 26mph with a high of 34 . What the fuck , Texas . 
I can't find my phone so for my coworkers , yes I finally put in my two weeks yesterday AND I talked to Sanchez . I actually felt a little guilty quitting because I like working with him and such ... 
Over 25% done with pregnancy :D 
I hate this squished bladder crap . I haven't slept through the night in ages and I'm so tired . 
Going to bed now . Hopefully I sleep through the night . 
I'm thinking < PROPMALE > has the flu . Wonderful . 
Oh thank you , Leal , for noticing I looked like crap and asking if I needed to eat . You're learning . 
Our towels have been stolen and oh , I can't find my phone =/ . Awesome day . 
Deuteronomy 22:23 -24 
Replaced stolen towels , but still can't find my phone =/ 
I feel like facebook is turning into a bunch of troll posts , but the sad thing is most of them are being serious =/ 
Worked , cooked dinner , and cleaned the kitchen . Go me :) 
3glasses of water and I'm still thirsty ... If this continues for another day or so ( making it not dehydration ) I'm gonna have to go to the doctor . Lovely . 
>:[ facebook , you showed a double so I deleted one and now they're both gone >:[ . I was just trying to tell people my dog goes to the litter box like it's a vending machine . And lol @ the immediate responses . You people are gross . 
Did soooo much stuff today . So tired . Gonna cook dinner then chill . Spaghetti tonight , but with meatballs and not ground beef . 
Hungry even after I eat . Boo . 
Took at 3hr nap today AND made myself drink a bunch of water . Feel much better 
Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate milk time 
Bored and nauseous . Awesome . 
I wish SOMEBODY wasn't so picky with vegetables so I could add things like zucchini and mushrooms and bamboo shoots to my food >:[ >:[ >:[ 
Making dinner ; hopefully < PROPMALE > doesn't eat it all so he has some for lunch . 1/3lb of meat , potatoes , and a veggie should be enough for one meal , riiiight ? 
Trying to read how to roll an enchilada so it doesn't fall out everywhere doesn't really work . I should've gotten one of the mexicans who were painting the apartments to help me . I ended up having more stuff on the outside of the enchilada than the inside . Next time I'll get bigger tortillas and more of them =/ 
Off to the HEB 
I have prepared a feast . Prep time for cooking is ridiculous- even when it's not completely from scratch . I had to deshell shrimp while simultaneously having two sep . pots of water boiling for pasta and potatoes . Then cooking the shrimp while pulling the pasta off and seasoning the potatoes . Then pulling the shrimp off and yatta yatta ya ... But now < PROPMALE>'s home :D 
Got lost on Thousand Oaks . Decided to keep going straight till I hit something I know . End up on 281 with EVERYBODY ELSE . Hit 1604 . MORE traffic . Took me an hr to get home >:[ now I'm pooped . My car's AC doesn't really work so I'm all nasty now too . 
Learned what a CPU , ACU , RAM , ROM , and hard drive do in the simplest terms possible . Now to learn the harder crap for A+ with < PROPFEMALE > :O 
So now I heave with such force that my nose bleeds . I'm afraid I'll start bleeding through my skin with my busted capillaries as well =/ . And when I wake up early ( before 6am ) I'm more likely to throw up for the first 4 hrs I'm awake unless I go home and go to sleep ... What the fuck . I thought my second trimester was supposed to be easier >:[ 
Booted the dog to the porch . I do not want to even see her . Still trying to clean the carpet 
For a < PROPFEMALE > shift , I'm REALLY tired . Baby making is tiring x.x 
Non-Asian foods for dinner . < PROPMALE > should be happy 
< PROPMALE > didn't even know what a swaddle was :O ! 
Got my printed pictures and put them in an album :D I've been wanting to do that for ages . But I'm missing pictures of < PROPMALE > when he was in high school >:[ . And I need a graduation picture for both of us 
Anyone else having allergies ? My nose is running off my face and I feel like crap >:[ 
I don't care if I'm the 3rd call in , Rude . I feel like shit and I know I'd throw up and get sent home anyway . Pregnant and having super allergies D: . There are oak trees right outside our windows ... 
Pug cuddles to make me feel better 
I'm ready for a new week :(
