“Although my heart may be weak , it’s not alone . It’s grown with each\ 
new experience , and it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve made . \ 
I’ve become a part of their heart just as they’ve become a part of\ 
mine . And if they think of me now and then If they don’t forget me \ 
Then our hearts will be one . I don’t need a weapon . My friends are my\ 
power ! ” ~ KH 
~ This is for all my friends past and present going off to new\ 
horizons , I thought this quote sums up why true friends are never\ 
alone no matter how far they venture . 
One more week and I'll be in < PROPFEMALE > . . . summer flew by pretty fast . 
Any one else not gone off to college yet ? I am starting to think I am the last one to go . 
Finally in < PROPFEMALE > , Oh how I love 97 degree temperatures and crazy high humidity . . . 
Almost done with orientation at SCAD and i love it here though it is VERY HOT here ( 97 degrees with high humidity >.<) 
So both < PROPFIRST > Zimmerman and ANT spoke at my oreintation , gotta say SCAD knows how to find amazing speakers who really make you think about the important things in life 
First day of classes is today , Drawing at 2 ( hope its a cool class ) 
Back from buying my < PROPMALE > supplies for my first class , the < PROPMALE > store was so crowded , and some lady thought I was trying to sneak a small dog in one of my bags into the store , lol . 
LOL there is a Pokemon Interest League and a Super Smash Bros Interest League at my school and I wanna join them 
Saw < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland yesterday , it was not as trippy as I thought it would be . 
So for that pokemon club at my school , they had two ppl dressed up like team rocket giving out flyers about it and when they meet . Gotta say their costumes were pretty accurate . 
Apokelypse FTW ! 
In your hand , take this Key . So long as you have the makings , \ 
then through this simple act of taking its wielder you shall one day be . \ 
And you will find me , friend - no ocean will contain you then . No more \ 
borders around , or below , or above , so long as you champion the ones you\ 
love . \ ~ KH BBS\ 
Distant Light . \ 
Do starry nights betray our eyes , \ 
As darkness births and lightness dies , \ 
Does each spark in the lifeless skies , \ 
Ignore the dreams of men , their countless cries , \ 
And why when I peer up high , \ 
Do stars vanish , leaving only dark dye , \ 
Almighty Heaven why do you deny , \ 
The light to see what my heart belies , \ 
Forcing me thereby , \ 
To lock away feelings gone awry . 
Blizzard presentation tonight hope its awesome ! 
Woot ! Lazer Tag lock in tonite featuring the pokemon club , gamers guild , and kamikazi sushi ( anime club ) . Geeks ftw :D 
Its good to be home :)
