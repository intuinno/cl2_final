Well today is my third day at my new job with < PROPFIRST > Carden/Allstate and I love it ! Anybody needs to email me during the day my new email at work is tinabowen@allstate.com .

Yet another headache ! Man I should buy stock in Excedrin . Oh well it will get better . The sun will shine again and all will be well ! 
I am so ready for warm weather ! I am just not a cold or even cool weather person . 
Finally the sun is here and it is spring weather ! Loving it ! Just wish I was off work ! 
Thanks everybody so much for my wonderful birthday wishes ! I truly appreciate them . I am sorry so late in saying thank you but we went to Jacksonville , Florida , Wednesday and didn't get back until last night . It was fun . Wish it had been a little warmer but hey I got one day of good weather and we had a good time as a family so what more can I ask for . 
Finally Spring is here !!!! 
I hate it when I don't know where I should be or what I should be doing . I think I know but I don't really . I just really hate that . I need to get my life figured out for once , at least ! Hope everybody is doing well ! 
Such a beautiful day ! God is so Amazing in all his beauty ! 
What do you do when it seems the world is falling down around you ?! 
THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU !
