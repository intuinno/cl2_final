Replace all I felt promised to me . \ 
To be the one who figured it out , \ 
Who knew what to do , \ 
Who knew how to feel and\ 
Felt that\ 
Love of the past , \ 
The worth of the world , \ 
Just set it ablaze and\ 
Thaw me out . 

why is febreze so frickin awesome ?

\Life is a long preparation for something that never happens . \ " ~ W . Yeats " 
Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable . 
I opened my eyes And looked up at the rain , And it dripped in my head And flowed into my brain , And all that I hear as I lie in my bed Is the slishity-slosh of the rain in my head . I step very softly , I walk very slow , I can't do a handstand -- I might overflow , So pardon the wild crazy thing I just said -- I'm just not the same since there's rain in my head . 
Ideas pull the trigger , but instinct loads the gun . - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Each time I see the Upside-Down Man standing in the water , I look at him and start to laugh , although I shouldn't oughtter . For maybe in another world another time another town , maybe HE is right side up and I am upside down . - Shel Silverstein 
If what they say is true You are a shadow in the fourth dimension To float away with you We see the corners where nothing happens While we drifted we were one Ceilings lifted walls were gone You speak the language of the breeze All your leaves were meant for me The love that every person wants to be - MGMT 
The true mystery of the world is the visible , not the invisible . - < PROPFIRST > Wilde 
\The world is but a canvas to the imagination . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Thoreau " 
doesnt expecting the unexpected make the unexpected expected ? 
we're just dancing , we're just hugging , singing , screaming , kissing , tugging on the sleeve of how it used it be . - kimya dawson 
We'll rest upon the Knee where all divisions cease to be and rootbeer float in our Banana Boat across the Tapioca Sea . When letting all attachments go is the only prayer we know . May it be so , may it be so , may it be so , oh ... Amen 
There are so many things I'd like to tell you . I wish you could understand , but if I told you both our worlds would change . For good or bad , I'm not sure . 
Love of mine some day you will die but i'll be close behind i'll follow you into the dark . no blinding light or tunnels to gates of white just our hands clasped so tight waiting for the hint of a spark . if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied illuminate the NOs on their vacancy signs if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks then i'll follow you into the dark 
I wish we could open our eyes To see in all directions at the same time Oh what a beautiful view If you were never aware of what was around you And it is true what you said That I live like a hermit in my own head But when the sun shines again I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in 
You're the echoes of my everything , You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night . You're the laziness of afternoon , You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom . You're the leaky sink of sentiment , You're the failed attempts I never could forget . You're the metaphors I can't create to comprehend this curse that I call love .. 
< PROPMALE > potter quote day : \i open at the close . \ " - dumbledore " 
Well listen to yourself there is a hemorrhage in your mouth , it won't stop bleeding . Well , you may be the traitor i will hold the smoking gun , you'll get away clean , i'll keep you secrets till the grave has swallowed me . and i will never tell a tortured soul that are burning by my side that i am a sinner , i am a savior , i am alive . 
the more that i would struggle , the more that i became entwined , and the thickets and the thorns became my flesh and i was vine . 
dreams are nothing , if anything , but fiction to distract the mind 
Until the last resilient hope\ 
is frozen deep inside my bones , and this broken fate has claimed me\ 
and my memories for its own , \ 
your name is pounding through my veins . \ 
Can't you hear how it is < PROPFIRST > ? 
We are , we are , intrigued . We are , we are , invisible . \ 
Oh , how we've shouted , how we've screamed , take notice , take interest , take me with you . 
I am fairly agile . \ 
I can bend and not break , \ 
or I can break and take it with a smile . \ 
And I am so resilient \ 
I recover quickly , \ 
I'll convince you soon that I am fine . 
Always , no sometimes , think it's me\ 
But you know I know when it's a dream\ 
I think I know I mean a yes\ 
But it's all wrong\ 
That is I think I disagree 
We're not the same dear as we used to be , the seasons have changed and so have we . \ 
There's little we can say and even less than we can do , \ 
to stop the ice from getting thinner under me and you . 
I can't go back to yesterday - because I was a different person then . 
Spite is never lonely ; envy always tags along . 
All this grows bitter that was once so sweet , \ 
and many mouths must drain the dregs of it . 
I'm another day late and one year older . 
If you walk away , I’ll walk away , first tell me which road you will take . 
Humans will kill each other , and when the last one stands among the corpses of his brothers , it is then that he will beg for death . Humans will curse their friends till he has no more , and in the end he'll realize ... He's all alone . 
we don't notice any time pass , \ 
we don't notice anything , \ 
we sit side by side in every class , \ 
teacher thinks that i sound funny \ 
but she likes the way you sing . \ 
tonight i'll dream while i'm in bed , \ 
when silly thoughts go through my head \ 
about the bugs and alphabet , \ 
and when i wake tomorrow i'll bet \ 
that you and i will walk together again , \ 
cause i can tell that we \ 
are going to be friends . 
I go back and forth forever , \ 
all my thoughts they come in pairs . \ 
I’m not surprised but I never feel quite prepared . 
Oh , the empty dreams were dim , \ 
and the empty dreams were wide . \ 
They were sweet and shadowy houses\ 
where my thoughts could hide . 
This mind within my mind , \ 
just waits for my demise . \ 
For after all is said and done , \ 
isn't that its ultimate prize ? 
And by and by he came to an end of things , and he was silent , and he sat there , looking out over the world , just wishing it wouldn't stop . 
Anger is an uncontrollable feeling that betrays what you are when you are not yourself - a powerful internal force that blows out the light of reason . 
I'm opened , your're closed . Where I follow , you'll go . 
Don't cry because its over . Smile because it happened . 
I will leave under the cover\ 
of summer's kiss upon the sky , \ 
like the stone face of your lover\ 
just before she says goodbye . \ 
I was certain that the season could be held between my arms , \ 
well , just as summer's hold is fleeting , \ 
I was here but now I'm gone . 
Draw your own sweet dreams for I wish you well . 
I want to die happy . 
It is the end of something simple and the beginning of everything else . 
I will walk away now with the realization that it will never be the way I want it to be . 
It's a lot easier to be lost than found . It's the reason we're always searching and rarely discovered . 
I don't know if we each have a < PROPFEMALE > , or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze , but I , I think maybe it's both . Maybe both is happening at the same time . 
I want to sleep on the air mattress with you\ 
and let the air leak out the whole night through . And as we sleep , our bodies slowly meet . \ 
I like to feel it when your heart beats , I do . 
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate . Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure . It is our light , not our darkness , that frightens us most . 
If I had a world of my own , everything would be nonsense . Nothing would be what it is , because everything would be what it isn't . And contrary wise , what is , it wouldn't be . And what it wouldn't be , it would . 
Everyone is just waiting . 
Happiness is a function of accepting what is . 
Look for comfort now , within these walls , \ 
for all these different days\ 
will slowly disappear , \ 
will slowly fall apart . 
I stare at the wall watching my time float away . \ 
It's all been a blur , and nothing will change . 
It’s the past , present , and waiting in line , it’s his and yours , and it’s especially mine . 
Difference is time . 
back from Europe .. just wow ! 
Happiness runs in a circular motion , \ 
thought is like a little boat upon the sea . \ 
Everybody is a part of everything anyway , \ 
you can have everything if you let yourself be . 
i like boys with strong convictions . \ 
and convicts with perfect diction , \ 
underdogs with good intentions , \ 
amputees with stamp collections . \ 
plywood , skinboards , ride the ocean , \ 
salty noses , suntan lotion , \ 
always seriously joking , \ 
and rambunctiously soft-spoken . 
After life there is more . The end is just the beginning . 
When the night has come , \ 
and the land is dark\ 
and the < PROPFEMALE > is the only light we'll see . \ 
No , I won't be afraid . \ 
Oh , I won't be afraid . \ 
Just as long as you stand , stand by me . 
Everything’s gone missing . \ 
I’ve lost more songs to floods . \ 
I can’t prove this makes any sense , but I sure hope that it does . 
There are no raindrops on roses or girls in white dresses , its sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses . 
In dreams , we enter a world that's entirely our own . 
I've been passed waiting for something to happen\ 
and I've been waiting here so long . 
Who am I ? This or the other ? Am I one person today and tomorrow another ? 
Remember not our faulty pieces . \ 
Remember not our rusted parts . \ 
It’s not the petty imperfections that define us , but\ 
the way we hold our hearts . 
In the hour of the sixth , forty men minus one , definition by definition , grow bleak . Failure . 
What if the clouds are fragments of mistakes , \ 
fabricated by the factories of our foolishness ? 
There is a worm at the heart of the tower ; that is why it will not stand . 
We are < PROPFEMALE > , glorious\ 
not from what we've done , \ 
but being the least . \ 
I was a wicked one . 
I am tired , beloved , of chafing my heart against\ 
the want of you ;\ 
of squeezing it into little inkdrops , \ 
and posting it . 
Blessed we come and blessed we go . \ 
But this world is full of white teeth and black lungs . \ 
The skin bares no scars , but it is gray . \ 
Your smile is so great , but your face is blank . \ 
Think not . \ 
Don't think . \ 
Suffice . \ 
The revolutionary fade ... 
Life is like a rollercoaster , \ 
it does flips and throws you over , \ 
board your ship that's going nowhere , \ 
if you stop , you'll end up somewhere . 
I cannot let you inside my cell for fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down . 
They carve the message deep within the broken hearts that fail to mend . Makeout kids never had a < PROPMALE > to be best friends . 
A song well < PROPFIRST > is a < PROPFIRST > well song , so sing . 
Fusion is the broken heart that's lonely's only thought . 
All you who sleep tonight , \ 
far from the ones you love , \ 
no hand to left or right\ 
and emptiness above -\ 
know that you aren't alone . \ 
The whole world shares your tears , \ 
some for two nights or one , \ 
and some for all their years . 
And though really all these moments are just in my head , \ 
i'll be thinking about them as i'm lying in bed . \ 
And i know that really it might now come true , \ 
but in my mind i'm having a pretty good time with you . 
i want so badly to believe that \there is truth 
Life is too short , \ 
death doesn’t ask . \ 
It doesn’t owe you that . \ 
Some things you lose , \ 
you don’t get back , \ 
so , just know what you have . 
But tomorrow may rain , \ 
so I'll follow the sun . 
Paper head , \ 
I prefer you because of your emptiness ;\ 
from within you any word could still be said . 
A language is not words only , \ 
it is the stories\ 
that are told in it , \ 
the stories that are never told . 
You tested your metal of doe's skin and petals \ 
while kissing the lipless\ 
who bleed all the sweetness away . 
Little soldier , little insect , you know war it has no heart . \ 
It will kill you in the sunshine or happily in the dark ;\ 
where kindness is a card game or a bent up cigarette , \ 
in the trenches , in the hard rain , with a bullet and a bet . 
Our greatest pretenses are built up not to hide the evil and the ugly in us , but our emptiness . 
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft , a long rehearsal for a show that will never play . - Amélie 
Without you , today's emotions would be the scurf of yesterday's . 
riding trains to the end of lines\ 
still we've got nothin but time\ 
the skyline looks brighter tonight\ 
lets go smash out every light\ 
your left foot in front of right\ 
and we yell\ 
ahh like a good old fashion nightmare . 
The flesh and the blood - they keep my body warm but still my mind is cold . \ 
To know what's fair is not always fair , but what proves real will never flee . 
Never let your < PROPFIRST > erase \ 
' cause broken legs can be replaced \ 
two steps to the finish line \ 
three sips till I finish mine \ 
a straw will always suck it out \ 
close your eyes and use your mouth \ 
and tell me about your song . 
And if we get beaten by this winter , \ 
if we get strangled by regret , just\ 
let our love of life and tension \ 
gasp in sweet and stuttered breaths , and\ 
have them lay us in a basement , \ 
smash some bottles on the ground , and\ 
say we never knew the difference \ 
between the feeling and the sound . 
In hoping that that distance \ 
wouldn't grow ... \ 
But how it grew , \ 
and how it hurt , \ 
and how it hallowed every memory ... 
Fate – monstrous and empty , you whirling wheel , you are malevolent , well-being is vain and always fades to nothing , shadowed and veiled you plague me too . 
we cast our roots deep , \ 
the grid extends its reach . \ 
things don’t look good\ 
as we feel the ground wake .. \ 
nothing will change , \ 
flames will walk the earth\ 
and nothing will change 
All the things that we take and we hold onto , and the things we create\ 
Make us those people we always wanted to know . \ 
So tape the things that you take for granted onto\ 
The walls of your room - the songs and pictures we need , they need us , too . 
two worlds remain in harmony\ 
as i stand by myself .... \ 
my god\ 
help me to find a way\ 
to reach to you without\ 
falling apart myself , \ 
my conscience-\ 
a reason\ 
to mask all of my doubts\ 
if i ever felt brushed with your greatness , \ 
i would always know i'd only weigh us down . 
Before the crowd of a silent mouth like air so thin in a dream of drowning , \ 
you'll find yourself inside this moment and confess that you're at war\ 
with what keeps you breathing . 
And it can have no bounds , you know\ 
It can have no end\ 
You can take my hand in the darkness , darling\ 
When you need a friend\ 
And it can change in shape , or form\ 
But never change in size\ 
The water , it runs deep , my darling\ 
Where it don't run wide 
a long wonder the world can bear and be .. 
Hey you , out there in the cold\ 
Getting lonely , getting old \ 
Can you feel me ? \ 
Hey you , standing in the aisles\ 
With itchy feet and fading smiles \ 
Hey you , dont help them to bury the light\ 
Don't give in without a fight . 
And there's a lake\ 
And at the bottom you'll find all our friends\ 
They don't swim cause they're all dead\ 
We never are what we intend , or invent\ 
' Cause I make little lies and then I pull them apart\ 
Think something dark's living down in my heart 
I think it takes a pile of bricks for us to make a home\ 
And I'm not sure that I hear mountains grow from just one note\ 
Block after block , block after block\ 
Everything happened , every step I've took and street I've walked\ 
Lights turn on and dark turns outside , blindside dream , - ding - you're next in line . \ 
It's plain now this is all me , now this is all me . 
I wish we could take every path . \ 
I could spend a hundred years\ 
adoring you . \ 
Yes , I wish we could take every path , \ 
because I hated to close\ 
the door on you . 
so surely and so steadily\ 
a slowly moving cloud will whisper \i am but for hours born to last\ " \ 
Oh , I can see your tracks\ 
But I won't follow them , \ 
I'll just hope for rain\ 
Or some kind of crazy wind\ 
To erase them\ 
And < PROPMALE > them into oblivion . 
And the rattlesnake said\ 
I wish i had hands so\ 
I could hug you like a man , \ 
And then the cactus said\ 
Don't you understand\ 
My skin is covered\ 
With sharp spikes\ 
That'll stab you\ 
Like a thousand knives , \ 
A hug would be nice\ 
But hug my flower\ 
With your eyes . 
Be not the slave of your own past . Plunge into the sublime seas , dive deep and swim far . 
< PROPFEMALE > came to a fork in the road . \Which road do I take ? \ " she asked . \ 
Don't let your soul get lonely child\ 
It's only time , it will go by\ 
Don't look for love in faces , places\ 
It's in you , that's where you'll find kindness . 
now i can see things from the outside and \ 
i will sit here\ 
with no place in mind . 
I spy YOU SPY ! with my little eye . \ 
That the desert you've deserted is a little dry . \ 
Dragging the moisture from the air , \ 
I am so dry ... Let me get a sip of what you\ 
Want me to say ! I am so thirsty ! 
Do the D . A . N . C . E\ 
1234 , fight ! \ 
Stick to the B . E . A . T\ 
Get ready to ignite\ 
You were such a P . Y . T\ 
Catching all the lights\ 
Just easy as A . B . C\ 
That's how we make it right 
And I never learned a lesson looking at my own reflection , \ 
but sometimes it seems useful\ 
So I loosen my heart strings in high hopes\ 
of starting to find something truthful 
crunch-a-tize me captain ? 
I think I saw you in my sleep , darling , \ 
I think I saw you in my dreams you were\ 
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise\ 
That your body couldn't keep . \ 
I think I saw you in my sleep . 
I recall once on the church steps , \ 
When I moved to kiss your chest , \ 
How we paid such close attention\ 
To each sweet and stuttered breath , \ 
I should’ve stopped to paint our picture , \ 
Captured honest pure affection , \ 
Just to document the difference \ 
between attraction and connection . 
Oh , how selfish of myself to always say that it was more than I could take , \ 
like it was pain I could not shake , \ 
like it could break me with its fingers , throw my body in the lake , \ 
and I would slowly sink away , \ 
but the Truth is it was sorrow that I made and would not face . 
See , I keep falling for the future after tripping on the past . \ 
And I am always tearing sutures out to make the anguish last like it defines me . \ 
Or reminds me I've found comfort in my suffering\ 
And uncertainty in happiness and death , \ 
Because what's next is such a mystery to me . \ 
I am terrified of all the things I feel but cannot see . 
We held a match to keep our sight on the path\ 
But the flame gave up and we lost it\ 
And I've knelt for the last three years\ 
Trying to find it back with the blackened matchstick\ 
Today I'm not afraid of failure\ 
The past is a flower\ 
The future , the snow\ 
I wasn't ever close to perfect\ 
But I never let you go 
We are the lovers , We are the last of our kind . \ 
Link your arms and keep your < PROPFEMALE > up \ 
and I swear that we'll be fine . \ 
Though we're not sure who we are , though we're not sure where we're from , \ 
though we're not sure when we'll leave , though we're not sure where we'll go , \ 
we keep our heads up , \ 
we keep our hearts up , \ 
we keep our hopes up . 
< PROPMALE > me the serenity \ 
to accept the things I cannot change ; \ 
courage to change the things I can ;\ 
and the wisdom to know the difference . 
Oh I like you so very much so much in fact I gotta wake you up\ 
It’s not that I have words to speak\ 
I just wanna see you looking at me\ 
In a way , that states\ 
In an hour when the sun comes up\ 
We’re gonna put on our shoes we’re gonna shake the dust 
If you fall , I’ll welcome you with open arms into the dark night\ 
I might seem cold but underneath\ 
I am just as scared and sad as you , and if you stay a while you'll find\ 
That I just want to make you smile . 
Pick a path though it shadows over mine\ 
These city lights spread like cancer on the skyline\ 
Clear your sights of all the habits that are mine\ 
When you get tired , you will never ever love again\ 
Or ever love again . \ 
So < PROPFEMALE > on ... 
i dont know why , i like you . \ 
i just know i cant stop thinking of you\ 
oh wait ! \ 
its cause you make me smile , \ 
you always make me smile :)
