Spending the day getting pampered at the spa thanks to my wonderful best friend ! It's a good way to start off the New Year :) 

112 degs !!!! ... but it's just dry heat , right ?? 
Laying out with the ladies and sipping pina coladas at a 5-star resort on a perfect AZ day ... doesn't get any better than this ! :) 
Surrounded by ppl bundled up and sipping coffee ... It is still summer right ?? Oh yea , not in scorching AZ right now . Searching for orcas and bald eagles on the way to San < PROPFIRST > Island ! 
I love the pacific northwest !! Enjoying drinks and great company on the water for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s wedding wknd !!
