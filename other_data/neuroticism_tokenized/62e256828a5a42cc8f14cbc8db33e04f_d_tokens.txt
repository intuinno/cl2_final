Our government is about to run up its credit card < PROPMALE > . lolz >.> 
The republic has failed us this day ... No , the rules of the republic were just ignore . That is what happened today . 
Is our government a democracy like says it is , or a republic like the founders said it is ? Right now I am not so sure we are either . 
Pepsi-cola or Coca-cola ? 
One more week till belt testing starts . I'll have my yellow when the tests are done . =) 
Ok . I'm giving up soda for the next six months .

Have a great Independence Day everyone ! 
I just got most of my books for this fall and loving this new < PROPFEMALE > laptop . =D 
It's starting to look like the problem with my computer is the motherboard . It could still be the power-supply , but seeing as I replaced it and the computer wouldn't read the hard-drive ... oh well , that's just my luck . (-.-) 
O . K , So I repaced the motherboard with a new one . Only to find out that the last power failure has seemed to have damaged the videocard . Well isn't that just great ? Is it just me or , has my luck been going down hill a lot lately ? 
< PROPMALE > Mt . Open , should I go and compete ? 
O.k. I just got back from going to see the shouting stars . I have never seen a sky so clear . Just five < PROPMALE > outside of town you can even see the milkyway . I'll have to go out there again . 
O.K. there is another TKD competition coming up in October . I'm thinking I'm going to go . It's not on a school day and I missed the < PROPMALE > Mt . Open , so I really want to do this nexted one . That is ... If I can get the money to enter . (>.<) 
Wow , I should really check my requests more often . (>.<) 
Internet Exporer is a sad joke . Almost ever time they make a new one it has problems , and the up-date that they say will fix the problems only make more propblems .
