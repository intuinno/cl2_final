As another year fades we look forward to a new year . May EVERYONE get all the love , life , and happiness they deserve in the new year . 

Why is the rum gone ? 
Vader makes everything better . 
Some things seem to improve with age . Some things were improved with age . Other things just got screwed with until their charm was gone . 
I'm not sure your stupidity is your fault . Though it damn well is your responsibility . 
If we cannot change the way of things , then we are wise to enjoy the journey . 
Ever have one of those days when your mouth just refuses to process the words that your brain sends , and you find yourself saying things different from how you are thinking them ? That has been my day . 
God bless stupid people . 
You worry too much . Do more ; worry less . 
I love a nice rain , we don't get it anywhere near often enough here ! 
While it doesn't get the good press that hard work and industry get , laziness is a talent to be cultivated , like any other . 
Grab what comfort you can , however you can , whenever you can . The ride gets real < PROPMALE > ' way too often . 
Relax ; the universe is out to get you . 
If you use a Porche as your daily driver : 1)Park in valet , if possible . and 2)If you don't park in valet , don't whine when somebody dings your door . 
God Bless < PROPFEMALE > , and keep safe all those that sacrifice of themselves for our freedom .

In this day and age there are cameras watching just about everything we do . You would think more people would check the elevator for one before having sex . 
No plan ever survives contact with the enemy . Never forget that YOU are the enemy . 
Define interesting . 
Too much blood in my caffeine system . 
You know you order too much pizza when : \ 
\ 
1 ) the delivery driver makes them re-make your pizza because it \looked burnt\ " \ 
What is the Matrix ? 
Sanity is overrated 
Prepare ship for ludicrous speed ! Fasten all seatbelts , seal all entrances and exits , close all shops in the mall , cancel the three ring circus , secure all animals in the zoo ! 
But this - this , this , this is like - being nibbled to death by , uh - Pah ! What are those Earth creatures called ? Feathers , long < PROPMALE > , webbed feet , go \quack\ " . \ 
If I had a dollar for everytime someone said that they would get me fired I would never have to work again . 
Greatness is never appreciated in youth , called pride in middle age , dismissed in old age , and reconsidered in death . 
If your're going to be worried every time the universe doesn't make sense , you'll be worred every moment of every day for the rest of your life . 
You know what they say , \A mime is a terrible thing to waste . \"" 
Understanding is a three edged sword . Your side , Their side , and the Truth . 
Fortune favors the bold ... and the foolish . 
Waiting for something else to go wrong 
copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a foot up the ass . People who need a foot up the ass affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a foot up the ass , except a foot up the ass . But ...... we ... can raise awareness ... 93% of people won't repost this . Why ? Perhaps it is because they too need a foot up the ass 
A little over an hour left and my busy week is finally over ... if I can get away quietly 
A Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is an honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran or thankful for your < PROPFEMALE > n Veterans and people in service . 
Daylight Savings Time ... what a waste 
There is something about cold weather that makes me want ice cream and hot chocolate , at the same time .

Happy Thanksgiving . Now can we fast forward the next 4 weeks and get ready for the new year ? I'm off to work now , let the silly season begin ! 
I'm surrounded by idiots ! 
Christmas music five days a week is driving me insane ! I'll be glad to be away from work for two days . 
\Your car was towed because you parked in a reserved space . \ " \ 
Time to start lining up the Christmas movies : Bad < PROPFEMALE > , Die Hard 1/2 , Lethal Weapon 1 , Gremlins ...

Alright people , the mall is CLOSED , its time to go home and wrap presents .

Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment/supplies . Veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping are own first . 1% will re-post and 99% wont . Have the guts to re-post this . 
There is actual snow on the ground in San Antonio ... it will probably be another 25 years before it happens again ! 
I can't believe how many idiots are out shopping tonight ! Go home people ! 
I just love working for a large company , they send us new computers but dont give us the passwords to finish setting them up ...

Why do we call it \Common Sense\ " when almost nobody has any ? " 
If you cannot find your way out of a mall parking lot then , maybee , you shouldn't be shopping there ... 
Murphy was an optimist .
