Circle k policy is no friends or relatives standing around the store on work time or wasting our time we hate lot of things to do accept wasting time in talking with friends or testing , any one needs more training for what needs to do check shift duties list its hanging here on counter . Hope everyone understand make store nice and do some work . 
i miss the easy days . when girls had cooties , dad was your hero , fun was going to the park with your sibling , mom was the only woman for you , abd school was the scariest thing you had to face ... 
ladies and gentalmen , uncles and aunts , crosseyed masquetos and bow lagged ants , i come here before you to stand behind you to tell you something i know nothing about , next thursday which is good friday there will be a mothers day meathing only for fathers , admission is free so pay at the door pull up a seat and sit on the floor . the topic to discuss , the subject we know nothing about 
I lost the Game 
so the wish i more or less wouldve made today woud've been to < PROPFEMALE > out with a select hand full o people . that would make my day . but i got to see < PROPMALE > and he's fun . but he was here anyways . so like most years my wish didnt get answered . wc = hich i guess would be my fault . i didnt openly invite people but i kinda wanted them to want to < PROPFEMALE > out with me . but oh well . today was just like any other day .

Happy Dad's Day to all the dads and also to the mom's who have to play the role as dad . 
Ugh ... It's been/ being one of those days 
So ... I just got home from work . It's 6 o'clock here . And I have to be back to work by 2 ... Anyone else see the problem here ... That's only 8 hours ... Law states that we need at least 12 hours between shifts ... Or so I thought ... 
So . The other day I sent a complaint to corporate about my manager . And today my manager , a manager from another store , and my district manager all came to my store to have a nearing with me . Meaning they were going to bully and threaten me over everything . And made me the bad guy . Saying I'm making things up and turning the truth around ... I've had a very bad day ... 
The only dependable thing about the future is uncertainty .
