and the Oneonta Jackets Varsity swim team beat Sus Valle 90-93 !!! 
hates the amount of homework she's been saddled with .... why , history , WHY ?!?! 
phails at Physics . YAY ! 
And yes , I wrote \phails\ " on purpose . Nah-nah-nana-nah . " 
is clinging to the wonder that is the almost-not-quite weekend . 
has had an amazing birthday ! ~ yay 
is pulling an all-nighter ... oh the joy . Darn you , US History !!! *dies of exhaustion * 
is reveling in the snow that was here this morning !!!

Happy Halloween everyone !

hates pendulums . Period . 
SNOW SNOW SNOW !!! 
has discovered the magic of the snow-day dance ... apparently , it worked . 
could really , REALLY use a hug right now . 
< PROPFEMALE > * belated * Christmas !!! 
2010 , it's been a real slice . 
Happy 2011 , everyone ! 
This may have been foolish , but ... was anyone else really hoping for the possibility of a snow day on Monday ? XD 
Is it wrong to want things to work out okay ? I don't think that should be wrong . 
I hate being incredibly , horrendously sick . 
rarely has something fantastically important to say ! ~ 
Why , midterms , WHY ?!?! 
has no more exams .... so why am I still busy ?!?! 
Snow day , snow day , la la la la la la !! ~ 
is just having one of those days , ya know ? 
is praying to the snow day gods ~ 
is flushing ice cubes and stowing spoons under pillows ~ maybe the magic will work this time ? 
... Hey , Snow ~ Thanks for the gift ; loving the no-school deal . And it's not that I'm not grateful and everything ... I just have one more boon to ask of you : can you learn to shovel yourself ? ' K , thanks , bye . 
is fairly convinced that the universe finds her exceedingly amusing to thwart . 
is now positive that the universe is out to get her 
\Be kind to your cranium !!! \"" 
is waiting for her homework to take matters into its own hands and do itself .... it hasn't worked yet , but I'm hopeful ... 
it came it came it came it came it came it came !!!!! 
blames AP Physics for her current madness . .... Maybe that'd make a good English project ? 8D .... Hm ..... 
now blames AP US History for her insanity ... oh the joys of being an overworked highschool < PROPMALE > . 
\This is a matter of professional pride ! No woman would marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not . \"" 
suddenly actually comprehended that fact that there are only 29 days until the AP exams and how that is NOT enough time .... Bagels . 
.... It's raining . 8D 
Mah mama always said , \Life is like a box ' a chocolates . \"" 
thinks vacation is a beautiful thing . 
needs AP studying to go away and leave her vacation alone . Pronto . 
... I like vacation better . ** rummages for remote with life-rewind ** 
is in love with Toothless . <3 <3 <3 I want a dragon so badly now . 
We just won the Regional Envirothon comptetition !! Huzzah !! 
US History SAT tomorrow . Oh , the joy . 
AP exams are eating my SOUL . Yeah . 
is wondering what exactly happened to the weekend . It was there , and then I opened my calc review book , and then ~ poof ! gone . 
I think this looks like a job for cookies . 
Good luck on US History tomorrow , everyone ! 
.... It's amazing how quickly studying Physics loses its appeal when you hit Bernoulli's equation . \ 
\ 
P1+pgh1+1/2pv^2 = P2+pgh2+1/2pv^2 makes my brain cry . 
Yes , my friends , the seemingless endless nightmare that has been the AP exams is , miraculously , at an end . Of course , we have two months of angsting over our grades ahead of us , but none of that matters today . Today , we revel in our freedom ! And eat impossible large amounts of baked goods . 
Alright , show of hands : who's just starting their homework now ? \ 
** raises hand sheepishly**\ 
@$^&*^%^#@ !!!!! 
has nothing to say , but felt like letting everyone know that she has nothing to say . Just saying . 
wants to find the dork who erased all her measurements for the giant wardrobe in the English room and feed him to a ravenous army of Eastern Hellbenders and starving iguanas . 
I just walked across my room to go get some work out ( to , you know , actually do some work tonight ... maybe ) when I saw what looked like an animal moving on my desk . I actually screamed and jumped about a foot in the air before realizing that it was just my stupid planner with the penguins on it . \ 
ACK . D8 
How did it suddenly become 10pm ? Or is it only 10 in THIS universe ? 
got very , VERY excited when she glued on the last piece of her bridge . There was much rejoicing , and the world was a happy place .... then she realized that there were no crossbeams , and complete chaos ensued . \ 
MUST FINISH D8 
doesn't know what to do without her bridge to build . .... Well , I guess there's still Calc , English , and History to keep me entertained . ** sobs ** 
.......... Meh . ** shrug ** 
Back from the wedding ! \ 
Now to memorize Envirothon speeches . D8 
Dilapidated octopus . 
Off to Envirothon ~ wish us luck , guys ! 
is amazed by the power of free ice cream . .... Just sayin ' . 
My house smells distinctly of cheesecake . Now , if I could only get the fire alarm to stop malfunctioning ... 
Well , I have successfully exceeded my own expectations of how incredibly idiotic I can be . \ 
( < PROPFIRST > , you can attest to my stupidity 8D ) 
New pics of my progress on the Narnia cabinet , for anyone who's interested ... \ 
http://hippiellama.deviantart.com/gallery/#Entrance-to-Narnia-Project 
woke up this morning , and decided that it was just way to early to get up . \ 
From now on , 10am is the new 8am . Just so you all are aware . 
.... ** ahem**\ 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
Thank you . 
I've been writing < PROPMALE > so long that when I walked downstairs to get a drink and my dad asked what I was doing , I said , \Ich moechte ein Glass Wasser . Haben wir Eis ? \ " \ 
Last day of school . \ 
** squee * 8D\ 
In a week , when all the Regents are over and everything ... I'll be like this . \ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgVNgYXFi_Q 
There's a baby < PROPFEMALE > in my yard , and it's fantastically adorable . 
was doing ANOTHER physics regents , and felt her soul slowly dying .......... D8 
! @#$%^&* .... yeah . That is all . 
IT IS DONE . \ 
My arm is tired . 
Here are some photos of the finished wardrobe ! ( the first three photos are of the finished wall , the rest from earlier stages ): http://hippiellama.deviantart.com/gallery/#Entrance-to-Narnia-Project 
June SAT scores are out , for those of you that took it . Hope your scores are good !! 
is already grumbling about summer being over . Why is debatable . 
thinks air conditioning might just be the greatest invention since sliced bread . 
GERMANYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!!! 
is obviously wanted by wasp assassins . 
I just spent almost 2 and a half hours doing online orientation for my class .... and I'm getting up bright and @#$% early tomorrow for a college visit . ...... It's summer ! I shouldn't have to miss sleep . D8 
desperately wants her AP scores . ...... Any time now . .... 
La la la la . 
The Cult of Domesticity just took over my brain . D8 
I honestly didn't know it was possible to cut your hand open on a doorknob , but there you go . 
Off to Neverland !!!!!.... or Cape Cod . Whichever . 
Well , if nothing else , I got a 5 on AP US History . \ 
Huzzah for that !!! 
This looks like a job for ... ICE CREAM ! 
ATTORNEY : How was your first marriage terminated ? \ 
WITNESS : By death . \ 
ATTORNEY : And by whose death was it terminated ? \ 
WITNESS : Take a guess . 
......... Really ? 
I've been listening to heavy metal and classical Russian orchestra music for two days now . An odd combination , but oh so glorious . 
Hear that ? ... That's the sound of the universe , laughing at me . 
Siri's eating ! Yay ! 
ATTORNEY : The youngest son , the twenty-year-old , how old is he ? \ 
WITNESS : He's twenty , much like your IQ . 
You know what .... Today's going to be a good day . 
Alright , at 69 < PROPFEMALE > in , I've officially decided that not even the cute little abused turtle can make the Grapes of Wrath even moderately acceptable . 
So , guys .... Is Inception worth seeing ? 
Penguins and turtles and sharks . Oh my . 
is not enjoying her term paper . 
I don't title my essays . Coming up with something for this paper is not going well . The titles all sound ... cheesy , with a side of cheese . Extra cheese too . And some cheese on top . And some more cheese , because there's no such thing as too much cheese . \ 
Cheese cheese cheese . 
BOOM . \ 
You hear that . That was Inception , blowing my mind to smithereens . \ 
But it was fun . 8D 
I have nothing interesting to say . Nothing smart , witty , vaguely amusing , or even moderately informative to say about anything . Instead , I'll drone on and on about how I have nothing to say , because I really have NOTHING to say . Nothing at all . At all . Nothing . N-O-T-H-I-N-G . \ 
Why are you still reading this ? \ 
I need a cookie . 
I think I'm gonna change my name so colleges can't find me . But there's really nothing amusing that I can come up with other than changing the spelling or becoming Becca Agonizing Pain . \ 
...... 
OK , College Board seriously needs to die a long , bloody death , with much suffering and angst and sharp pointy things . \ 
I'm trying to find out if I walked under a ladder or broke a mirror or something ... My luck just ain't working for me . 
Do you know the Muffin Man ? 
Renaissance fairs are amazing . 
I just want something to be simple . Is that so wrong ??? 
Awesome thunderstorms are awesome . 
Just turned in my final project . \ 
Now I have to wait for the grade . D8 
I'm feeling nostalgic . 
I don't care anymore . \ 
In other news :\ 
I have a new slogan for Oneonta , but I'm going to refrain from saying it ( or typing it ) because there are children present . >_< \ 
Becca out . 
Today looks like a day for obscure rock bands and cookies . 
Wrathful grapes !!! D8 
The < PROPFEMALE>'s knees . 
Who are you talking about ? Because I'm talking about Romilda Vaaaaaaaaane . <3 
I have spent over 30 of the past 96 hours in the car . \ 
... Well , if I wasn't fat before , I most certainly will be now !!!! 
\YOUR HOROSCOPE : Today is a good time for making new friends . A good deed may have unforeseen consequences . Don’t upset any druids . You will soon be going on a very strange journey . Your lucky food is small cucumbers . People pointing knives at you are probably up to no good . \ 
What do you want me to do , dress in drag and do the hula ? 
I've been listening to \Doubt\ " by Delphic and playing with LEGOs all day . \ 
is working on the cake for < PROPMALE>'s birthday . We've been working for ... 4 hours now , and we have half of a castle done . 
Happy birthday < PROPMALE > ! Today , you enjoy your first day of double digits . And tonight we laugh and feast on a cake that looks somewhat like a castle . 
And Thus Sprach Zarathustra . \ 
Onward , to autumn !!! 
One day down ... XD\ 
Happy first day back , guys ! 
Math and I aren't friends . We aren't even on a first-name basis anymore . 
can now turn right . \ 
BOOYAH . 
WHY IS INTEGRATION BY PARTS SO DIFFICULT ? D8 < 
Why am I still awake ? \ 
Oh , homework . Duh . 
It's the weekend , la la la la la ~ ! 
Hi everyone . 8D 
Hey , does anyone who is in Calc BC want to help me tomorrow morning with the homework ( I know , no one DOES the homework , but it's worth asking , right ? 8D) ? Because I've been doing #15 for almost 45 minutes now , and I STILL have the wrong answer . D8\ 
PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE ? 
just wrote a little over 2 pages for an assignment , only to discover that it only needed to be 7+ sentences . Total . \ 
WHY , CRUEL WORLD ????????? D8 < 
Everything is better when the house is full of chocolate chip cookies . 
has been humming a song for half an hour , but doesn't know what the song is . >_< 
Sleepovers , composed of your little brother's ten-year-old friends = no sleep D8\ 
** sigh ** 
I'M OUTNUMBERED , AHHHHHHH D8 
Fiddling with college essays . I feel ... lost . 
I might have a breakdown if I have to fill out one more extracurricular activity on the Common App . \ 
IT HURTS US D8 
I feel kinda lonely . I don't know why . Argh . 
Interview for MIT tomorrow . WISH ME LUCK ! 8D 
Sweet mother of < PROPMALE > Lincoln . \

AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-ee-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU ~ \ 
When life gets you down , sing like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
To say of what is that it is not , or of what is not that it is , is false , while to say of what is that it is , and of what is not that it is not , is true . 
Oh Illness , you choose an inconvenient weekend to strike . D8 
College applications are like a hill . Filling them out is like driving up a hill , and hitting that \SUBMIT\ " button is the reaching the top of the hill . And after that 
LOOK AWAY . I'M HIDEOUS . \

< PROPMALE > Navez ( espionage agent ) was told by his priest , as he was dying , to forgive his enemies . Navez replied , \I have no enemies 
College applications are DONE . \ 
... until December , when I've been rejected . XD 
Watching the Rally to Restore Sanity . \ 
It's really amazing . 
I have so much homework to do\ 
Sad thing is , I don't really want to\ 
So instead I waste time\ 
Trying to think up a rhyme\ 
To wrap up this poem for you . 
Don't look now , but there's an orangutan behind you . D8 
just got a note from her professor saying that the grade the online gradebook had posted for me for my Composition class was wildly inaccurate and would be fixed sometime next week . \ 
Which sucks , because I was really enjoying believing that I had a 132.98% . D8 \ 
Phooey . 
has nothing important to say . 
I LOVE the end of daylight savings time . Extra hour of sleep , mwa-hahahahhahhhaaaahaaa . 
LUAU . 8D 
Hi . 
So many paragraphs , so little time ... 
Just finished writing the rough draft of my research paper for my Comp class . \ 
Successfully upheld my tradition of overdoing it by doubling the < PROPFEMALE > requirement and writing a grand total of 14 paragraphs . \ 
Fail fail ? Perhaps ... 
THE CURRENT ISSUE HAS ARRIVED . ** holy music ** 
What Becca READS : Write a 2 < PROPFEMALE > paper about how a hero ( modern from contemporary literature or classic from ancient myth ) is an example of the hero's monomyth . 5-7 < PROPFEMALE > s double spaced . \ 
What Becca DOES : Writes a 19 < PROPFEMALE > s double spaced paper about how < PROPMALE > Potter is an example of a classic hero myth . \ 
I think the phrase \fail fail 2fail fail to the fifth plus fail\ " is appropriate . D8 " 
Cue theme music ! 
My neighbor told me I was a fabulous dancer when she caught me tearing it up at the bus stop . 
< PROPMALE > Potter 7 at midnight ... HP7 was so awesome I can't find words to describe its awesomeness . 
still can't get over how awesome < PROPMALE > Potter was XD 
Homework is a jerk . All it does is irk , and drive me berserk . 
VACATION WOOOOOOOOOOO 
HELLO WORLD . 8D 
My dog Siri just had a seizure an hour ago . She's all right now , but I won't be on much for a little while until we know she's OK . If you need me , call or send me an email . Thanks guys ~ 
Goodbye hectic , crisis-packed weekend -- HELLO SNOW ~ ! 8D\ 
** PS- snow day please ? No ? ... It'd be nice . ** 
Three cheers for horizontal snowfall ~ ! Huzzah , huzzah , huzzah ! 
I'm self-teaching myself songs on the piano , I'm so desperate not to do work today . 
Off to Boston ! \ 
WE HAD BETTER GET A SNOWDAY TOMORROW . 8D 
Phase Two , gentlemen . The adventure continues . 
Introductory helicopter nature shot ... \ 
( bad guy at a safe distance ) 
Solution to less-than-fulfilling week ? Go see Tangled , and then eat cookies . 
Everybody was kung-fu fighting ~ ! Na na na na na na nah ~ 
just found an invite to participate in a pageant amongst my college mail . \ 
Might I just say : \BA-HAHA-BWA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA . \ " \ 
It's the most wonderful tiiiiiiime of the yeaaaaaar ~ !

THANK YOOOOOOOOOOOOU , SNOW GODS . 8D 
Me : Ms. Lynch mentioned something about snow on Tuesday . \ 
< PROPMALE > : Is she the snow guru ? \ 
Me : No . She's my Economics teacher . \ 
< PROPMALE > : YOU HAVE AN AMISH TEACHER ? \ 
Me : No , < PROPMALE > . ECONomics , not Eco Amish . \

< PROPFEMALE > sigh . \ 
... Snow day tomorrow please ? 
stayed up way too late watching Weapons of Self Destruction and has an interview in a few hours . Awesome . 8D 
Doctor : I've absorbed all the radiation into my body . I just have to concentrate ... expel it all in one spot ... My left shoe !! ** flails ** Out , out !! ** one-footed can-can flail ** ** throws shoe**\ 
Martha : ... You're completely mad . \ 
Doctor : You're right . I look daft with one shoe . 
OHS female seniors !!! : we're trying to get a petition together to ditch the yellow robes for graduation !! Please let me know as soon as possible if you're willing to sign/help get signatures !! Thank you ! 
Nuts and berries !! D8 < \ 
So much for studying . 
Wait ... I'm done ? 
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet ! 
Thanks so much for such a fantastical last day , everyone !!! ( the cake and singing was lovely 8D ~!) 
Saw Tangled again . It was even better the second time . 
First day of work tomorrow . I'm excited/nervous . 8D 
I have access to the secret room under the stairs that's full of paper towels and thousands of fossils . \ 
** happy dance ** 
Stood on the front step throwing water into the air and turning it to snow . \ 
I feel so powerful . 8D 
If you're reading this : just thought I'd remind you that you're awesome . 
Just got my first college admissions decision . Hopefully that can tide me over until April . \ 
** fidgets impatiently ** 
Next time I walk a mile and a half with a broken toe , punch me in the face . Please . \ 
Nice day today , though . Global warming is upon us , it seems . 
And STOP- can't touch this 
Spent the day cataloging rocks and hominid skulls . A little creepy , but the best part about it are the faces kids make when they see you sitting in a corner of the museum holding a skull up to examine it , and then you wave and say hi . 8D Excited or really confused were the popular responses . 
“I reasoned that if I destroyed the world all in one go , no one would know . ” 
Sherlock is my new obsession . 
OK , icky drive to Ithaca today . I had to leave early in order to avoid the rebound of Snow-maggedon . 
Snow snow snow snow snow-SNOOOOOOW snow snow 
My boss was checking out the rocks and minerals that I was cataloguing and started asking me what all the different rocks were . Let's just say , she very much enjoyed the \That's not gneiss 
If I get one more bagel-eating , berry-picking , dag-flabbit invite to model in a pageant , I will KILL SOMETHING . 
is really disappointed that the magical-3-minute-microwave-chocolate-cake-in-a-mug was kind of like chocolate rubber . \ 
What did I do wrong ??? D8 
Figured out a solution to my dismay at having missed Senior Administration Day . \ 
I'm a School Board Member . There just happens to be no meeting today . \ 
8D 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day , everyone !! Anyone who happens to find a pot of gold somewhere -- share please ? 8D 
Where did this snowstorm come from ?

Too bad it won't last . 
has no good anagrams for her name . 
Blueberry blueberry la la la ~ 
IT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWNNNNNNN ~ 
After almost a year of angst , I forgot what it's like to not feel worried and nervous . It's like ... weird . \ 
Yay for the end of the college admissions process ! And congrats to everyone on their glorious success ~ !
