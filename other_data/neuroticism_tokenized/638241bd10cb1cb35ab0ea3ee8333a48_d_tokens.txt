1 If I Erase These Thoughts Of The Past , Would My Life Be As Long ? For Everything Left Undone I Want To Start Over Again . 
2a I Should Be Chasing The Never-Ending Dream , Following The Path , I Trip Over People In The Crowd . Thinking Back As I Look Up At The Sky Without Reason , I Wonder What It's Like To Go Back . Understanding You Is Hard , Because When You Sacrifice , You're The Only One That's Sad . Your Sins Aren't Shed As Easily as Tears , They Remain Your Burden To < PROPFEMALE > . You Can't Find A Way Out Of This Emotional Maze , 
2b So Who Are You Waiting For ? 
3 Writing In My White Notebook , I Remain Loyal With What I Say , But Why , When The Dream World Seems So Real ? To Bestow The Fight , To Become Alive , I Scream For That , Can You Hear My Cries ? Safety Is Nothing , Because I Can't Return To That Place . 
4 I Was Thankful When It Was Kind As Well As Strong ( I'm On The Way ) I've Come To Miss You , Such A Pain Is Welcome Too . 
I'm Turning 32 Tomorrow . All I Want Is To Be Able To Dream Like Everyone Else Does . Since I Can't Have That , I'll Settle For Time With ALL My Kids , Cheesecake , & Whichever Friends Choose To Visit . A Tank Of Gas Wouldn't Hurt Either . :-)

It Was Great Seeing The Kids . Hurts To Let < PROPFEMALE > Go Again . But It Was Great Singing With Her Again . Thanks To Those Of You Who Called . & The Rest , I Understand You Have Lives Unlike Me . 
So I'm Out Of Texts Until The 15th I Think . At Least Now I Can Stress Out While Figuring Out How To Destress/Relax Enough To Sleep . 
So We Make An Agreement & Then She Denies It . She Picks A Fight Over Her Actions & Company & How That Reflects On Her . & I'm The Bad Guy For Being Worried . * Sigh * Done , Washing My Hands Of It .

So After Extorting Me Continusly Regarding My Clothing , My Possesions , & Letting Me Sleep At Night , She's Now Threating To Cut Of My Phone Service Because I've Asked Her Repeatibly To Leave Me Alone For A Day Since All She Wants To Do Is Fight . * Sigh * Where Do I Find These People ? 
Why Won't She Ever Leave Me Alone ? I'm Done Being Played With . 
So .. Who Wants To Babysit Tonight ? 
I'm Done With People Who Insist On Depending On Alcolholics , Stoners , & To Take Care Of Our Kids . 
Tomorrow .... * Sigh * 
So Today ... It's Been 19 Years Today . I'm Surrounded By Family , But Feeling Alone . All Because One Person Betrayed Me , I Feel Like I've Slipped Back , & I All I Can Do Is Hide How Bad It Hurts . It's Been 19 Years Today Since I Lost My Mother . & A Part Of Me Is Still That Lost 13 Year Old Boy . 
I Don't Want To Be Alone Anymore ... I Want It All To Stop Falling Apart Around Me ...

PLEASE\ 
put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by \ 
dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't \ 
know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people won't copy and paste \ 
this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are \ 
sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and ...... the \ 
remaining 2% are awesome and will repost this 
Need Zzzzz & coffee . 
Moving 1500 pounds of turkeys when your exhausted & injured your left foot is a hassle . 
I Need Help . Does Anyone Know Where The Closest AMC Is ? Not Cinemark , Not Carmike , I Need AMC .

Utilities turned on tomorrow . 
Utilities are on but h2o heater needs work before being used . 
spent the first night at new place . So glad I had an electric heater to serve us . 
Sick as heck & still at work . No rest for the wicked . 
Still sick ( I know unheard of for me to be laid out this long ) but had a gray friend help with the move . 
I hate pulling 30 hr days . 
3x a week I pull 28+ hr days . I've slept 4 , been awake 15 , & have to pull 10-11 @ work now . Then a 2hr class before driving 30 mind home . 
Exhausted . Lets see if I manage to stay awake on the drive home . 
Made it fine . Took nearly an hour . Stayed awake for a change . 
Hurt knee & ankle . 7+ hours before I can leave . Hurting . Tired . 
I need more sleep not just rest to heal . 
Sick of feeling exhausted , excluded , blind , & pain . Can't grab or grasp with either hand without pain for two days now . 
New glasses were ready early . I can see again ! 
Clipped my bad ankle @ work 3 hrs ago . Just got home . Ankle very swollen . Wife wants me to go to VA to look at it . 
Everyone else gets a stovetop dinner . I get one hot pocket to get me through the next 15 hours . It really sucks to pull 30 hour days . 
Due to losing nearly half my team this past week , I no longer have Wednesday off . There go my plans . * Sigh * 
Below freezing in break at work . Had to steal personnel from floor to fill in on my team for the night . It'll be a long night . 
So my son locked me outside for a few minutes . No shoes , keys , or phone . Scared me . Back in now . 
Need more sleep . Got three newbies to train up though . 
10 Days . * Sigh * 
I will not go through this BS again . 
News widget on my phone has 3 stories right now . 2 for iDiots in line for iPad2 & 1 about the japanese nuclear plant explosion . Priorities ? 
3 iPad stories & only 1 about japan nuclear reactor disaster . Priorities learn ' em . Cult of Jobs aside , we can all agree which is important . 
Bday Sunday . Who wants to throw me a party ? 
So ... Sunday ? 
Work first & if I'm lucky a little sleep . No AC & my fan is busted . 
So as emails start coming in from forums in regards to my birthday , but 7+ hours of work left before I can sleep . 
It hurts . I've waited 8 months to see my < PROPFEMALE > again & now it WON'T be today . I miss my eldest daughter so much . 
My two year old is in front of the tv whispering \xbox kinnect\ " wondering why its not doing anything . " 
My two year old put the plastic fangs in his mouth & roared until the baby laughed . I love my kids . :-) 
It has been 20 years . I miss you , Mom .
