Happy New Years !! ^^ 

Needing a makeover 
Business or Culinary ... that is the question . 
~ Loving his night vision pic ~ 
I am mad as hell >:( 
\hearts are beating faster and nothing could be hotter \"" 
What am I gonna do now ... 
There's Nothing Else I Can Do , Than Fall For You . 
My nerves are so shot .. v_v 
Way too much drama .. -.- 
~ Smile , it makes people wonder what you're thinking . 
~ A balanced diet is a cookie in each hand . 
Shin : A device for finding furniture in the dark . 
~ Laughter is when a smile has an orgasm . 
I can feel the invisible connection between us . I know you can < PROPFEMALE > derstand me like no other , and I can see past your skin into your soul . Even though we have never met , I know you better then I know myself . I can feel your pain from worlds apart , and you can see my < PROPFEMALE > shed tears . Each day without you is an eternity , endless are my nights . Living , I am in a dream yet to be realized , barely holding on to it . 
Blooming roses , crimson petals stained with transparent memories . Thorns caress the skin of my palm , Rain cascades as a waterfall . Reflections of you and me , mirrored as if by the ocean . Roses decorate the garden of my dreams . You waltz to me with your dream flower , petals adorned with tears and love . Rain cascades as a waterfall , embrace me now and never let go . 
~ Never wanted to dance with nobody but you . 
~ Give me one firm spot on which to stand , and I will move the earth . 
Why have I suffered , almost the same blows such countless times ? But even so , I'll probably fight again , for that is one of lifes mysteries . I want to overcome the ceaseless pain in my chest and become closer to you . I have wandered about once and returned . Falling in love , saying goodbye .... with a vow that this is the last heartbreak . 
Kremlings <3 
\Reaching as I fall .. \"" 
We can fight our desires , but when we start making fires we get ever so hot whether we like it or not . They say we can love who we trust , but what is love without lust ? Two hearts with accurate devotions , and what are feelings without emotions ? 
The heart dies a slow death , shedding each hope like leaves . Until one day there are none . 
I just love rumors !! I always learn new stuff I didn't know about myself . XD 
After Monday and Tuesday even the calendar says W T F . 
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be , a little gambling is fun when you're with me , I love it . Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun , and baby when it's love if its not rough it isn't fun . 
I get off on you getting off on me , \ 
give you what you want\ 
but nothing is for free . \ 
It's all give and take the kinda life we make , \ 
when your line is crossed\ 
I get off . 
There is no < PROPMALE > , only Zuul . 
If it is written in the stars , then it can be read\ 
For this is prophecy\ 
The future\ 
A thousand million possibilities\ 
Is it my < PROPFEMALE > ? 
I want to thank everyone for the Happy Birthday , it means a lot to me . Love ya all ! <3 
The sudden summer rain , \ 
passed by my tears in a quiet stream \ 
A scene so like one from my memories \ 
A summer re-run of a fall drama . 
Much unlike a mortal\ 
who hurts the ones they love\ 
A dragon's love is forever\ 
and as pure as a peaceful dove 
Think I'm here for all the wrong reasons , can't do it wrong when you don't do a thing . Once in love , it's more like a habit . Guess that's what I need , to feel like me . 
I look in the mirror everyday .. I see the past and memories . I want it to end .. I want to be different and leave my old self behind . I want to change .. * wonders if he should dye his hair * 
* wishing someone would love him *
