Early morning .... it's quiet . That rarely happens in our house . 
OK-I've wasted enough time this morning on the computer doing quiz after quiz after quiz after ... well you get the point . Catch you all later ... 
Going to putt around the house , just straightening up until the birthday boy from yesterday gets up . Then we have most of the day to ourselves . 
Sunday morning , all is quiet at our house . The youngest is sick ... so it's going to should stay quiet , for the most part . 
Tuesday morning ... all is not quiet . House is busteling with kids getting ready for school ... buzy , buzy buzy . 
Ok-so I can't spell \bustling\ " ... there's more to life then spelling !!! Get over it people !!! hehe " 
All I am in the mood to say is ... R.I.P. Grandpa < PROPFIRST > 
Morning ... going on a trip . Funerals are never any fun ... But necessary .

Vacation over .... time to go back to the grind ... time to make the doughnuts !!! 
is glad it's quiet and peaceful around here right now . 
< PROPFEMALE > Johnston I just updated my MySpace < PROPFEMALE > ( I know ... blasphemy on here !! ) But since Facebook's music player is *** not good *** I decided to just update my music on a different < PROPFEMALE > -check it out and let me know what you think . The address is www.myspace.com/vanima_atara 
Damn Social Security Administration !!! I hate bureaucracy !!!! 
Realized it's almost 2 in the am and I have to work in the morning ... nighty night all . Love to all my friends . 
Tuesday ..... hmmmmm ..... interesting day ..... It's friggin ' cold here !!!! But what can you do ? Move to a warmer place . Like the Bahamas ( Hmmm ... Bahamas ... warm weather-and hurricances .... I think I will take the cold !! ) 
Darn ... I ran out of credit to send hearts ... I'm not done yet ... oh well . The rest of you can wait ' til tomorrow . Doesn't mean I don't love you just as much . 
Happy New Year to all of my friends . I may not have as many as most ... but I love all of you . I hope this year brings all of you new beginnings , happiness , joy and prosperity . Love you all . 
Put ? this ? on ? your ? status ? if ? you ? know ? someone ? who ? has ? or ? had ? cancer ! ? All I want for 2010 is a CURE ! ? ( 93% WON'T Copy and Paste this , will YOU ? Too many people have died of this invasive disease . ) I know people that have cancer . I know people that have died from cancer . It's a killer . Please repost and help stop this . 
OH ... and I didn't read the directions .... sorry 
It's finally Friday !!!!! 
I just left my keyboard unattended . Prepare to have a half dozen chain letters cut and pasted . I should know better than to do this sort of thing with an incurable smartass in the house . 
I traded eyeliner for dark circles , salon haircuts for ponytails , long showers for hairy legs , late nights for early mornings , designer purses for diaper bags and AWESOME shoes for flipflops . I LOVE MY KID and wouldnt change a thing ! With Mothers day drawing near lets see how many Mom's repost this because us great moms will always give up things for our kid ! 
People need to understand that children \ 
with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & \ 
it's not contagious . They only want what we all want- to be \ 
accepted . 99.99% of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you\ 
do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's \ 
Special Education week , and .. this is in honor of all the kids who \ 
need a little extra help . 
So the < PROPFIRST > just died going around the corner on a semi-busy street . We had a friend tow it home and he said its something that can be fixed relatively inexpensive . Thank God it was nothing serious . But ... don't know when we will be up and running again :-( 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a \ 
man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , \ 
OFFEND & INSULT her , there's a man wanting to flirt with her & \ 
remind her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a \ 
man wishing he could be her lover . While you make your woman CRY there's\ 
a man waiting to steal smiles from her . Post this if you're against \ 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
Happy Birthday tooooo yyyyooooooouuuuuuu !!!!.... Happy Birthday tooooo yyyyooooooouuuuuuu !!!!... Happy Birthday Dear Kare-Bare !!!!... Happy Birthday tooooo yyyyooooooouuuuuuu !!! \ 
\ 
I hope you have a wonderful day !!! Enjoy lots of good friends and family celebrations ! \ 
Love you , J 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a \ 
sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as \ 
your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you \ 
do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people \ 
won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some \ 
point in our lives . 
Hmmmm .. I changed my profile picture and now I see some old comments from totally different picture pop upon my wall .... damn Facebook !! 
What were you doing when Mt St Helens \ 
erupted 30 years ago today ? 
Might not be the most beautiful or the \ 
sexiest ... Nor have the perfect body ... I might not be everyones first \ 
choice .... But I am a GREAT choice ... I dont pretend to be someone \ 
else .... Cause I'm too good at being ME ... I might not be proud of some of\ 
the things I've done .... but I'm proud of who I am today . Take me as I \ 
am ... or don't take me at all . Copy and paste if you live your life \ 
being you ..... 
Hey all of you out there !!! Don't forget to go see MacGruber tomorrow . It's going to be an awesome movie !! I personally can't wait to see it . 
I wish heaven had a phone so I could hear \ 
your voice again . I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I \ 
thought about you yesterday , and days before that , too . I think of you \ 
in silence and I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a \ 
picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , from which I'll never \ 
part ... God has you in his arms ... I have you in my heart . 
Good night all ... wish me luck in the morning !! Big day tomorrow !! 
I would just like to take this time to wish all of the fathers out there a very Happy Father's Day to all of the fathers out there . 
Some people need to hurry up and check their facebook accounts !!! I'm an impatient person today !!! 
In a funk today .... don't ask . You should already know why . 
Bought her youngest daughter a new bike yesterday and gave it to her for an early birthday present . Now all 3 of the little ones ( who are not so little anymore ) have bikes , and Mom and Dad will be getting bikes by the end of the week . I am excited-we are going to be a mobile family who doesn't have to use the car to get places !! 
Have a safe and Happy 4th everyone .... 
Happy Birthday to you\ 
Happy Birthday dear Antonya\ 
Happy Birthday to you !! \ 
I love you ... hope you have a fun birthday . Love Mom 
Making Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cookies for my < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
Life’s not the breaths you take\ 
The breathing in and out\ 
That gets you through the day\ 
Ain’t what it’s all about\ 
You just might miss the point\ 
Trying to win the race\ 
But the moments that take your breath away 
OK .... the secrets out .... we are going to Camp < PROPMALE > family camp this weekend . We will be gone Thursday to Sunday ... I am excited to be getting away from life for a few days . We all deserve it !!! 
Getting ready to go to Camp < PROPMALE > !! Yeah .... a break from life for a few days ... No phone , no lights no motor cars , \ 
Not a single luxury , \ 
Like Robinson Crusoe , \ 
As primative as can be 
I\ 
have carried a child within my body . I have comforted a baby upon my \ 
chest . I have kissed boo boos , mended broken hearts , been puked & \ 
peed on , woke up in the night to a feverish child & more . But I \ 
wouldn't have it anyother way ! My body is not magazine perfect , but when\ 
I look in the mirror I see a mom , and there is no greater honor or \ 
blessing . Make this your status if you are proud to be a mom ... 
PUT\ 
THIS AS YOUR STATUS AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE RATE YOU ! ( : 1 : crazy , 2 : I'd \ 
marry you , 3 : talkative , 4 : sarcastic , 5 : i miss you , 6 : goofy , 7 : \ 
moody , 8 : dumb , 9 : mouthy , 10 : spoiled , 11 : random , 12 ; hot , \ 
13 ; funny , 14 ; in shape , 15 ; amazing 16 ; tough , 17 ; cute 18 ; gangster 19 : \ 
nerd 20 ; I love you .. \ 
Public or private .... your decision 
If you have a wonderful man , who is your whole world ... who isn't perfect but perfect for you ... who works hard and would do anything for you ... who makes you laugh ... who is your best friend ... who you want to grow old with and who you are thankful for everyday ... then tell him you love him and post this as your status . \ 
I just did !!! 
Hey .... I've have had a video posted by more then a few friends on my wall and on theirs ... and when I attempt to go to it ... it is blocked from my computer as suspected Web Forgery ..... so be careful you guys . Facebook has done it again !! 
My parents were\ 
MEAN to me when I was a kid ! They made me do chores , go to school . \ 
Theygave me a curfew , made me get a job and work for the things I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school and my job and takepride in my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic and ... respect ... for the ... law . I thank God everyday ... for my ............ MEAN parents ! 
I am an UN-APOLOGETIC AMERICAN ! I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of < PROPFEMALE > , and to the REPUBLIC for which it stands , one nation under GOD , indivisible , with < PROPFEMALE > and JUSTICE for all ! I grew up reciting this every morning in school . It's a a shame we no longer do that for fear of OFFENDING SOMEONE ! Let's see how many < PROPFEMALE > ns will re-post this and not really care about offending someone . 
Is tired of being sick already !!! 
The two definitions of < PROPFEMALE > : \ 
1 ) a large group of hybrid plants cultivated as garden flowers . \ 
2 ) A sissy , fag , < PROPFEMALE > , or one that is generally unmanly . \ 
So for those that say \a < PROPFEMALE > is a flower\ " when I say \ " Stop jumping around like a < PROPFEMALE >\" ..... HA ! " 
Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank checkpayable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love a Veteranor support the Troops .

Kids\ 
with special needs aren't sick , gross or stupid , and their handicap \ 
isn't contagious . They want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . \ 
Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it up as \ 
your status for one hour ? It's special education week and this is in \ 
honor for all special needs children 
Happy Thanksgiving to all . 
Finished dinner , stuffed to the gourd , God it was good if I do say so myself !! 
Change\ 
your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To \ 
not see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . Join the fight \ 
against child abuse . Copy & paste this to your status to invite your\ 
friends to do the same . 
For all of you that think that The Muppets were not cartoons .... you don't remember the Muppet Babies !!! 
So let me get this correct ... \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage . \ 
......... < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > & Tiger Woods are screwing EVERYTHING , \ 
Yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to ... \ destroy the ... institution of marriage\ " Really ? REALLY ...?? \
