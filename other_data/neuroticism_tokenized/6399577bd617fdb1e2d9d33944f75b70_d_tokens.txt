IS MAN . PROMISE . 

How the time is never now , and we know who we should love , but we're never certain how . I know you might roll your eyes at this , but I'm so glad that you exist . 
is eating salt and vinegar chips for breakfast . and now , lunch . 
i am helplessly watching myself be buried in the depths of my own mind . 
uggggh fuck me running . this shit is some crazy bullshit . 
Seeing no resolution to my existential recognition of loss , I decide to eat lunch .

reason number 954 to not password your bluetooth connection on your phone : i will send you horse porn . receive bigblackstallion . mov ??? 
finally approaching human again . a week of abusing drugs/alcohol + getting sick in the sun = holyshithorribleidea . now , a cheese sandwich and cleaning will help get me back on track .

keeps typing ' netdix.com ' instead of netflix . 
i not-so-secretly fucking hate you . tell your friends . 
I have learned an important lesson today . don't work hard . don't take ownership . don't step up , fight for other people , or offer help . do your job . that's it . 
sacked out on the couch with the windows open , candles lit , high as shit . the rain sounds like < PROPMALE > smith songs and ITS AMAZING . 
wonders if the company has any idea how fucked they are when I say fuck it and disappear 
he has issues with time/space and eventual and inevitable system loss . \ 
Or what do you call that ? Passing . Mortality . 
so incredibly messed up i can't even articulate it other than a series of sniippets and ideas and colours . if only you could all see what my brain is ripping apart and making up . 
had an entire 2 days off . a weekend . like a normal person . instead of working today . fuck migration , fuck marketing , and fuck the ridiculous working parameters i deal with . i'm going to get drunk . 
nothingnothingatlastthereisnothing

cleaning apartment while listening to death cab . holy shit i have amassed a LOT of belongings . makes my skin crawl . 
bitches don't know ' bout my crippling panic attacks .

Is lol'ing while her boss flails around trying to be effective at her job . STRUGGLE HARDER LOLOLOL 
ah , to be young and spiteful ... 
dear facebook , i'm tired of your shit . fucking work . stop timing out , stop giving me redirect errors , and let me do my fucking job . thanks . 
i am going to get so insanely fucked up in chicago , & take so many photos . wandering downtown high as fuck is one hell of a way to spend my vacation . 
Oh sweet the dude who vaccuums our office just told me he gets paid two dollars an hour more than I do . Thanks dude , have a good weekend 
has stopped throwing up blood from an ulcer gone crazy . has slept 27 hours this weekend , and is out of hallucinogens . a productive ( if not life-endangering ) weekend . 
why do boring people exist ? ugh . if you're not of any use/entertainment/benefit to me , gtfo of my face . 
i am not the type of person to do ' photoshoots ' , what the hell have i gotten myself into . 
\Approximately 0.1% of respondents have a lower agreeableness raw percentage than yours . \ " apparently i'm an unrelenting fucking asshole . awesome ! " 
Dreams don't come true . Dreams die . Dreams get compromised . Dreams end up dealing meth in a booth at the back of the < PROPFEMALE > Garden . Dreams choke to death on bay leaves . Dreams get spleen cancer . 
would fucking love it if it stayed this cool for her shoot . 
you seriously think i want to shoot you in a bunch of trees ? my first real shoot involved a creepy shower , a bottle of whiskey , a typewriter , and fully clothed people . come on .

just because i think your life is shallow and empty doesn't mean i dislike you . ...... oh wait , yes it does . 
\Here's to save face for < PROPFEMALE > and my public apology to her for all of the stoning that she has endured to date\ " <--- i should really be hearing this 2 or 3 more times a day ~ " 
current salesforce status @ work : day 276 : migration continues , the team slogs on . group morale is flagging , but we've caught hints of the elusive ' event registration ' bringing some of us out of our nonprofit QA haze . < PROPFEMALE > is an untamable beast , we fear for our lives . send provisions . -production

( 1:55 PM ) < PROPMALE > Darkmagic : it often makes me jealous ... not that I'd admit it \ 
( 1:56 PM ) < PROPMALE > Darkmagic : <_____< \ 
( 1:56 PM ) < PROPFEMALE > Sackman : ... that means a lot to me . thanks . 
if you aren't listening to the tallest man on earth yet , you deserve to be shot . 
Bad news comes , don't you worry even when it lands . Good news will work its way to all them plans . We both got fired on exactly the same day . Well we'll float on , good news is on the way . 
making a pointed , bitchy website to showcase someone's ineptitude on the back of ' revenge ' page-a-day calendar squares . 
last night i realized i do not miss the life i thought i did . i miss being that connected to the person it involved , but i don't long for the quotidian way of life that being with that person involved . 
time to disappear . 
oh god everything looks like it has a 3pt fuzzy white stroke on it 
puts paperclips on things , is a mooch , kills a car , walks to work and watches the melancholy of haruhi again while researching facebook . 
nothing like being told to work 12 hours because someone's a lazy fucking cocksucker and you're sick . 
always lives in her own head , everything else is sound and fury . 
dear < PROPMALE > . you have no idea what you did for me tonight . thanks , 
had the worst day she's had since she was an intern . i don't know how much longer i can do this . it's time to go back to canada . 
dear office cleaner lady . thank you for asking me how i'm feeling . you're one of two people who did that today . i will indeed try some theraflu . thanks for the suggestion . 
hmm I don't know what to think about you IMing me late at night and then we both ramble for two hours , sir . I love it , but how bored are you that you're talking to ME ? 
spent 5 hours last night listing the names of the ' birth trees ' , the chinese zodiac , the greek horoscope , the dwarves , the 7 dead sins/7 virtures , the elements on the periodic table , the presidents ( in reverse chronological order ) , the states & capitals , the provinces of canada , and then playing a game involving acronyms . i also somehow tricked 3 other people into doing this with me . best night ever . 
late night office breakdowns with my favourite company : < PROPMALE > , and the cleaning crew . ugh . 
is in love with shredmaster . AKA < PROPFEMALE > ' Gleek ' Danforth . 
fear of today : when i was walking to work it was just before the game started . i was terrified people thought i was a huskers fan or something . 
ugh , i just realized i maintain five facebook accounts . two real ones , a fake one , two for work . fml . 
fuck you . 
Yay , still worthless ! 
is really tired of feeling like she's borderline retarded . 
aw fuck < PROPFEMALE > just fucked up again . this is fucking pathetic . 
really needs to stretch her ears to 6g . and get another tattoo . ... and get her septum retainer put back in ... 
just cleaned the office . smells like bleach ( yay ! ) and popcorn ( boo ) . 
definitely got bleach on her favourite cardigan . a fantastic end to a really shitty week . way to be , november . gonna < PROPFEMALE > out with a bottle of gin and a crossword puzzle and try and white-noise myself to unconsciousness . 
just ran a mile in 9 minutes , 10 seconds . i cannot believe i didn't die . now , the mile jog home . 
is pretty sure her phone getting fucked up has been the best thing that's happened to her in a long , long time . 
wishes she could stop hoping this one guy will fucking figure it out , and just get the fuck out of < PROPMALE > . 
is all socialized out for the next week and a half , now . 
i am listening to a lecture on religion as natural phenomenon and reading hamlet . i am the biggest fucking elitist you know . 
dear coworkers other than me who are still here at 7pm . \ 
\ 
i am sorry for playing the white stripes as loud as my speakers will go . oh wait , no i'm not , suck my < PROPMALE > . 
watching < PROPFIRST > bird on youtube , suggested videos : ' miley cyrus : party in the usa ' , and ' ice cream paint job ' . what . the fuck . 
I HAS CONCERNS . 
fucking sick and tired of rumors and speculation and people assuming i'm , apparently , one of the worst kinds of people . 
i find it really hard to not still like you on a level i'm not supposed to . 
plans for this evening are much the same as this afternoon : writing , vodka , depression . 
no one should be this drunk at 630 on a sunday 
got dressed still drunk . was told i'm wearing ' the most emo outfit ' someone has ever seen me in . 
would rather work on abused women websites all day than work on fucking god related church bullshit . 
is really really ready for these withdrawl symptoms to fucking go away . hey hallucinations , how're you 
got some really creepy photos tonight . hard to look at some of them . 
dear girl i'm going to destroy at work . you may be a size four , have bigger , more luxurious hair , and better clothing than me . you may have the ( misdirected ) accolades of our more retarded coworkers . you may have a ( useless ) degree , a husband , and a deep , meaningful relationship with an entity that doesn't exist . you don't , however , have the capability to do your job without me . bring it , bitch . 
aw , my mom sent me an e-birthday greeting card . written in magenta comic sans ..... at least she remembered ! 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbr2djsnklI&feature=related my morning . 
oh god can't stop listening to imitosis . 
this reminded me of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . http://cdn.imgfave.com/image_cache/1290471235628846.png nsfw . 
loves all the guided by voices references in the IT crowd . 
stop making me fucking choose between your dumbass client , and undermining the system we've tried to build up . because i will keep fighting for the integrity of the system to win every time . 
http://cdn.imgfave.com/image_cache/1278825328877952.jpeg 
as lame as it sounds , i feel like i can breathe again . looking out my bedroom window , i see a real city skyline . 
likes to imagine all of the people in < PROPFEMALE > garden commercials get cancer or die in meth lab explosions . 
has spent about an hour plotting , storyboarding , scripting , and editing stuff for a bloopers edition of the good bad & the ugly podcast firespring helps out on . and has spent much of that hour giggling like a 5 year old because it's going to be really entertaining . 
el oh el the dipshit who sits beside me at work unfriended me on facebook . finally ! it only took four months . \ 
drunk at work , el oh el 
integral calculus AND VODKA ! i am too smart for this shit i need to go < PROPFEMALE > out with some fucking physicists . 
removed her ex from her facebook friendslist . feels much better . 
well if i shouldn't go to work because of a fever , you better believe i'm going to work my ass into the ground cleaning , organizing , and otherwise doing chores i've neglected for about 4 months . 
is always terrified after missing a day of work that she will go back and be fired or something . i have quit jobs before because of this anxiety . 
needs to start freelancing again in the new year . 
ahahahahahahahahahahaha your life is so far from what it should be it's mostly amusing to me . 
a word of advice : never . ever . work with third parties . 
feels kind of like a bitch for a comment she made calling unintelligent people ' civilians ' today .... but it isn't my fault you can't speak on a level i want to be spoken on with . 
is not ready for the bullshit week ahead of her . would like to throw a ' goddamn you , you assholes ' at < PROPMALE > and thane , for leaving me to deal with the hell hole i'm in with no one to whine at . >_< 
will probably be alone for the rest of her life . 
why not start the week i'm all alone in this fucking department with a hacking . 23 of our sites got hacked , including an internal ticketing system . fml . 
my goal is to make it to work an hour earlier each day this week . i got to work at 11am yesterday , today : 10 ! yeah i'm awesome . 
oh wait i'm supposed to care about my job OH WELL TOO BAD YOU FUCKING RUINED THAT . thanks , jerks , now i'm free to not give a shit !

i feel like my ' s < PROPFEMALE > sackman ' facebook account is an alter-ego . some kind of elaborate lie that i've put together for the benefit of those who know just the fringe of the type of person i am . 
who the fuck uses the term ' best friend ' anymore ? fuck you , facebook , what are you , 10 ? 
has one 4g chinese serpentine plug in , and one 6g howlite plug in . yeah , i'm stylin ' . 
has a bad habit of replacing food with body modification . pain = delicious . om nom nom . 
definitely got drunk during work , twice yesterday , then got a huge motherfuckin ' raise , and had sushi . unfortunately , now i have the beginnings of a migraine . again . this is fucking lame . 
You've got all and it's pretty good , but I seem to be in disbelief . 
the best part of my job is logging in to other people's facebook accounts and laughing at their really sad lives . 
finally fucking unadded a bunch of people she really didn't need on her fucking friendslist on her other account . LIBERATION . 
really wants to call in sick to work tomorrow and just drink herself unconscious so she doesn't have to talk to anyone/do anything and can just wallow in angst/indulge in neuroses . 
is too fucking stupid and useless for her job . 
so i guess i fucking use ajax now , just like a pro . and by a pro i mean a fucking moron who is too stupid to figure anything out . i'm pretty sure i should just quit and sweep floors for a living . i'm not smart enough to use my brain for a job . 
will be at the office until at least 10 . uggggh 
i was going to jokingly tell you to break up with your girlfriend . decided that was probably in poor taste . 
\For the multiverse and individual freedoms \"" 
hopes you all die in various fires . 
my company has been selected as a finalist for the 2011 Top Small Company Workplaces award . now that i'm paid somehow competitively , i couldn't agree more . 
the results of my LP weren't entirely conclusive but the MRI definitely shows some kind of < PROPFEMALE > masses . i most likely have something affecting my hearing , my eyesight , and my automatic functions ( sleeping ? ) , but it's not evilevil . steroids for now . 
really wishes she worked with someone capable of doing their job . 
my mom keeps ending all of her emails about my family being evicted with ' lol lol lol ' . 
no iframes on static fbml tabs ? suck my < PROPMALE > , facebook . 
We're such plants - oxygen , xylem , phloem - in the wrists , pumps to the greed of your delusion to a blind knowledge of sight from fall chosen from spring . 
arbitrary outing with co-worker : total success ! co-worker super awesome , planning on going to another show with him already . 
bye . 
wake up . yoga , work , meeting 1 , lunch with former co-worker , back to work , drive to peru , tromp through hills for 2 hours , drive back , work , walk to haymarket , work until midnight watching people paint dicks made out of bisque . ??????? profit . 
i am loading content about fucking ENVELOPE SIZES . i can't believe i'm getting paid what i'm getting paid to do this . 
Reaaaaally shouldnt have left work at 9 and drank a bottle of vodka with < PROPMALE > and then went back to work . And yet .. 
hmmm ... do i < PROPFEMALE > out with the person who i credit with ruining the life i really liked , or no ? decisions , decisions ... 
fuck that < PROPFEMALE > Sackman bitch . 
is so hungry she may kill someone and eat them 
Just ran into < PROPFIRST > and muffin on the street . < PROPFIRST > did a doubletake as I smirked at him and he realized who I was , and he wobbled and nearly ate shit on the icy intersection . 
BITCHES HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD I'D LIKE TO BE DRUNK ON SET TOMORROW 
plan for this evening : locking myself in a bathroom and having a nervous breakdown . 
is defragmenting her hard drive with some good ol ' fashion drinking & drugs 
drinking a huge glass of straight < PROPFEMALE > whiskey , re-reading like being killed for the 170th time . 
email sent to all office :\ 
Hey ladies , \ 
I just noticed a pair of women's ( purple , < PROPFEMALE>'s Secret , size small ) \ 
panties off to the side of the cabinet in the unisex bathroom . They'll be at \ 
< PROPMALE>'s desk if you want to come claim them . \ 
(* Actually , I stuck them in that cabinet with the extra paper towels , so \ 
just head on in and grab them . Nobody will know . ) 
it's all about timing , huh . 
Now we're cleaning the windows between us two ... But I've begun to trust the view here . 
i < PROPFEMALE > the things which will destroy me in the end . 
it's 1 o clock in the afternoon on a saturday . TIME TO DO SOME DRUGS . 
It all seems fine . These things are off your mind . Remember we're born to die . 
been staring at my tattoos for the past 30 minutes . it's amazing to me how easy it is for me to disassociate . working on geometry makes me trance-y . 
no reason to stay is a good reason to go 
awwww shit son , time to start the job and apartment hunt in vancouver/toronto . my goal is to be outta here in time for fall semester . come on , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > let's get the fuck out of this country . 
i've got trouble written all over me . 
VANNNNNCOOUUUUVVVVVERRRRRR I WANT TO LIVE IN YOU 
one of the guys from IT who has never said a word to me just added me on workchat , sparked me , and told me ' that has got to hurt your ears ' re : my music volume . wtf . 
okay i drank three long islands in an hour and now i'm contemplating doing some drugs and peacing out for the next four days y/n 
sorry guys 
man i forget .... which came first ? the bad idea , or me befallen by it . not giving a shit . may we never forget you . may we never forget you . 
in times of great stress , i get pierced/tattooed/destroy my hair . i kind of want to do all three this weekend . 
taking loads of drugs , meditating in clean fresh air in a clean apartment , and peacing the fuck out . bye , kids , see you in obscurity land . we'll see what i come back with . 
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK 
i fear i hate you . i didn't want to . 
the real reason i don't want to walk home in the rain isn't because my hair will get wet . it's because i'm pretty sure i'll just wander around until i fall unconscious . 
when i said we were hiring for production i made many a joke about ' if you don't know x , don't bother ' . \ 
apparently , i should have been a little more strict . \ 
if you can't write a php loop , please , fuck off . i don't care if you know dreamweaver . i don't care if you can use flash . that's not what we're looking for . 
is drunk and high and dancing in her living room alone to a bunch of loud punk music . 
can't take more people saying that myself and so-and-so would be SO GREAT TOGETHER IF ONLY .... can't keep staying in a place that has absolutely nothing for me , can't keep alternating between feeling too smart for what she's doing , or so dumb she can't do her job , can't keep lying about my mental state , can't keep worrying about shit that has no bearing on her life , and shouldn't . 
did you know : it takes about 14 hours to load 350 pdfs one by one , name them , and then sort them into 16 different categories ? there are no words for how much i want to end my life right now . 
dear boss . \ 
don't throw shit at me to get my attention when i'm clearly in the middle of trying to fucking work . thanks . \ 
-s 
to the new people added to this profile . hi . this is where my not-so-nice thoughts go . 
whenever i do sleep , i usually listen to documentaries about astronomy or physics while i'm sleeping , just in case learning by osmosis is possible . 
must . stop . thinking . about . suicide . 
my life just got about four hundred times more fucking complicated 
makes facebook applications all day , fixes facebook bugs all night . 
definitely forgot she had her quartz icosahedron in her hand when she fell asleep , and now has another icosahedron outline on her side from sleeping on it . ow , pointy . 
woke up , worked out , got keys , started cleaning my apartment , went to work , back home now . in the process of throwing away entire bags of things in an effort to get rid of the built-up anxiety . 
dmt in chicago ! 
all i can think about is disappearing 
is fucking sick of you all and wants to get the fuck out of here . fuck my irrational fears , fuck my intuition , fuck my friendship with the only guy on the planet who can fucking say ' i told you so ' ( that's you , < PROPMALE > ) , fuck being sober , and fuck the fact that i can't stop caring 
was doing my blogroll this morning and ran into a wonderfully well written article on ' the maxx ' . cue introspective < PROPFEMALE > . 
god isn't real god isn't real god isn't real . spoiler alert . 
it's just a different tone . a different resonance . -- long , rolling waves . not the high energy ones . 
one of those catalysts that changes everything forever . there's no unseeing that . jesus . 
i can't believe i willingly came back here . what the fuck is wrong with me . 
oh also , hey , new chick , you shouldn't put a copy of ' web design for dummies ' on your fucking desk at your new job as a web developer . 
i had 12 cases today . 2 of which were critical . six of which anyone with half a fucking brain could have done . 10 of which SAT IN THE QUEUE UNTIL I CAME BACK FROM VACATION . i have 6 projects that are 5+ days late , and two untracked projects that are due this week . mmm , vacation . 
lost another swipe card . sorry , IT 
finds it interesting that her body wants to follow someone else's example so much . 
drugs for breakfast ! 
cleaned . read . ate easter food . loomed in the periphery of a family oriented day , part , but apart . drove around < PROPMALE > , re-realizing for the millionth time that life is incredibly unfair , and i will only ever be attracted to the overly tragic characters . i swear to god if that story < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > mentioned is about him , i will end her . 
definitely didn't realize it was monday today . fuck . 
slowly catching up on the ridiculous amount of work hanging out ... i feel so incredibly stupid all the time . if i was smarter , i'd be able to keep up . 
way to scare the shit out of < PROPFEMALE > #4562 : send her a picture of a giant chinese knife and then stop replying to text messages for a day . 
fuck . this .
