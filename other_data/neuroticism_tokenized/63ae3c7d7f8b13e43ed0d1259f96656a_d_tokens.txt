Had an epic night last night watching three dance/singing movies in a row and havind deep talks with Summer and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Yes , < PROPMALE > has an unusual amount of bandaids on him . But from everything I've learned in the medical field , it's that cuts can happen anywhere ! Anywhere in the body . It's not even explained half the time . That's a ... that's a real statistic ... 
Very very mixed feelings for the graduation tonight . Bittersweet 
Summer is off to a great start ! <3 
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle . Life is a maze and love is a riddle . Just enjoy the show .

The < PROPFEMALE>'s!!! 
Had a great time last night with Summer < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Heller ! <3 
I think I was just electrocuted . 
I had a great weekend . Friday I got a whole bunch of new music on itunes . Saturday I had an awesome time at summer's . Sunday I saw The Other Guys . Today I went to < PROPMALE>'s house for a great bbq . I hate school . 
So I just realized that before they make announcements on the bus they say \and now a message from the bus ... \ " I always thought it was \ " and now a message from the BOSS\ " Now it makes more sense . " 
330 tomorrow cannot come quicker . 
See it . Smell it . Touch it . Kiss it . Kiss it ! It's the motherload ! 
I was in the car and we had to get into this < PROPFIRST > so we could turn , but then a biker gang comes up in that line . Since we can't get in front of tyhem all , we just decide to get in the middle of them . This macho biker drives up next to us and says \Get out of here ! \ " But we had to turn soon so we didn't . Then he comes in front of the car and slows to 5mph . then all his biker friends pass the car and shaka . mlia " 
I haven't stepped out of my house yet today . I feel like the bubble boy .

I just ordered two amazing shirts , GLEE returns in 4 days , and my Birthday is in 5 days . Life is good . 
I am the stupidest person ever . I thought that GLEE started at 8 not 7 D: 
I stepped on a rock at the beach yestersay . It scrapped some of my skin off , but it didnt bled or anything . I then walked around with no shoes on for the rest of the day . now it's infected and I can't walk . :(

( Right after I kick a box of popcorn over while exiting the movie theatre ) \Don't-React like nothing happened . \ " to Hali'a Osorio " 
I wanna see Social Network this weekend . Who hasn't seen it yet ?

I just wathced the social network . It may have been the best movie I've ever seen . I wanna watch it five more times , then buy it , then watch it ten more times ! It shouldn't have ended .

GLEE was really good ! And the people who think it wasn't are lame . 
I never cry in the wrong parts of sad movies . \For some reason < PROPFEMALE > never wanted to go home . \"" 
I just saw a gorilla walking a dog down the street . 
Come see The Crucible at DHT this weekend ! 
Hand sanitizing stations will cost you your life . The worst thing you can do for your immune system is coddle it . They need to fight there own battles . If anything , they should have Hand De-Sanitizers . 
Thinks Hali'a Osorio should have boogieboarded down the street last night . I mean , it was raining really hard . 
You better check yourself , before you wreck yourself .
