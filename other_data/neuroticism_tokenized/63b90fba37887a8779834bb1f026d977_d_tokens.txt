So in 2009 I met < PROPFEMALE > Andrews , Bernedette Peters and Svengoolie and saw < PROPFEMALE > Peters , < PROPFEMALE > Neuwirth and Nathane < PROPFIRST > perform . 2010 so far I get < PROPFIRST > Izzard , < PROPFEMALE > Lupone and < PROPFEMALE > Patinkin . I like how this is going so far :) 

I think my artistic talents have left me . That or the eraser I'm using disagrees with my charcoal . 
Beetlejuice , Beetlejuice , Beetlejuice !!! 
Just found tons of beautiful shoes and clothes I want . Now I just need to whore myself out for the money to purchase them . 
why don't things ever go right ? 
My knee shifted out of place again . OWWW now I can only hobble . What the hell . 
Hopefully Hellraiser will cheer me up . 
OH GOD ! Just saw a couple pictures of < PROPFEMALE > Bonham-Carter's new costume from Hp and the Deathly Hallows . So after this movie I must begin on that costume . 
PRIDE PARADE ! 
I have taken to putting my hair up everyday , whether in curls or not . And I LIKE it ! 
Off to South Haven for our two year wedding anniversary . :) 
Had a great few days in Michigan . I got a new drawing table , new corset and am now waiting on my new dress and hopefully new Victorian boots ! 
Sew , clean and bake for the rest of the week . 
can't stop giggling when I see Bellatrix in HP trailers ! 
Still thinks the stage version of Sweeney < PROPMALE > is better ... but only if < PROPFEMALE > LuPone is involved . 
Must buy new Vanity Fair ... Red < PROPFEMALE > pics * SQUEAL * 
\We would often be sorry if our wishes came true . \ " Even my fortune cookie is a Sondheim fan . " 
Being half Mexican especially in the summer , is not conducive to this whole wanting a deathly pallor look . 
I get to see < PROPFIRST > Poppins tonight ! 
Saw < PROPFIRST > Poppins last night . I can't contain my joy , it was amazing ! There is still magic in the world . 
< PROPFEMALE > Neuwirth and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > will be starring as Morticia and Gomez Addams in the new musical beginning in November . Can my life possibly get better ? 
ex . er . cise . 
Off to see < PROPMALE > Potter ! 
AAAAHHHHH < PROPMALE > Potter . AMAZING ! 
Had an overload of Bellatrix goodness last night , must fix this with even more < PROPFEMALE > . 
Should I or should I not watch < PROPFEMALE > whilst I exercise ? I think the answer is yes . 
is miffed at the inability to find the perfect shoes . Why do boots need to come with zippers ? Is it really that hard to lace things up ? 
blah blah don't care anymore . 
not going to lie , pretty excited for the movie < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > Streep can never fail to make me smile . 
may very well throw up , stomach cramps and the constant urge to hurl is not pleasant . 
why must I be in pain ? At least < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > makes me smile . 
why Jenks ... WHY ?!?!?! 
is sad , I know how to fix this ! 
rejection and abandonment makes doing stupid things way easier . 
I know what I want . Now to find the means to pay for it ... 
needs to figure out my wee morning hours/exercise movie . 
I think today calls for 3D sidewalk chalk 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland teaser trailer . AAAAAHHHHHHH 
why can't certain things come with pictures so you know what you're getting into ? 
necessito mas tamales ! 
I had it ... now it's gone . 
headache but SVU should help until the game begins . Then drawing and more headache ! 
mirrors are really starting to piss me off ! 
AAARRRRGGGGG !!!!! 
seeing < PROPMALE > Potter at midnight at IMAX should cheer me up tonight 
congrats again < PROPFIRST > Buehlre :) 
can't get over my infatuation with Bellatrix nor her creator . * sigh * Hopeless I am . 
not a particularly happy little goth . 
hunger pains = frustrated and awful < PROPMALE > 
is quite weak and pathetic . 
f*ck you ... except certain people 
so much for going to see the Sox tonight , thanks a lot and PISS OFF 
reciting Silence of the Lambs word for word & working on my drawing . 
had a great time at Market Days . All the while in a full corset , take that waist line ! 
It's 10:13 !!!! 
The Fantastic Mr. Fox is coming out in November ! 
and now come the creepy eps with dolls and clowns ... crap . 
BORED 
my love for < PROPFEMALE > Peters just seems to grow everyday :) 
good to know that when you're the Slayer you can train and fight hordes of demons without breaking a sweat . Where can I fax my resume to ? 
determined to finish the drawing soon . 
plan is : finish drawing before working on zombie make-up . One thing at a time . 
apparently I can only draw whilst drinking tea in proper Victorian fashion . 
worried about my < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm finishing this thing TONIGHT ! 
Ok , if I lived in Elizabethan times I would have started dinner hours ago but come on , give me something for someone who doesn't plan ahead ! 
I don't care for watching < PROPMALE > Brown but his recipes rock and this Sweeney < PROPMALE > ep is amazing . 
mmmmm zombie make-up 
NOOOOOOOOO the front lace from my leather bodice is missing ! 
scribble , scribble , scribble 
Preparing for the Renaissance Faire tomorrow . 
Hooray for last minute sewing projects . 
a shower after 15 hours of being covered in latex and sticky blood is a beautiful thing . 
Or we have some shepherd's pie peppered with actual shepherd on top . Ok I'm not using ACTUAL shepherd but it's still good damnit . 
hmmmm microdermal or surface piercing ? 
Oh Project Runway you make me so happy . Can't wait to be reacquainted with you tonight . 
I need a new winter coat . 
is pretty convinced she is nothing special . 
:( 
needs new pillows . Waking up in pain is annoying . 
is extremely sad but looking forward to tonight 
The most disturbing thing in my life ? Having a toddler in the same movie theatre as me ... watching < PROPMALE > Zombie's Halloween 2 . 
< PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > is pregnant again , more obvious chest size changes throughout < PROPFEMALE > ? It's like Where's < PROPMALE > ! 
pft whatever . 
Fire/drum/dance circles make me feel all fuzzy and tribal inside . Can't wait until next time . 
Can't < PROPFEMALE > just admit she's my mother already ? 
Tonight calls for some < PROPMALE>'s Dragon . < PROPMALE > can always make me feel better no matter how down I feel . 
* sigh * 
Just saw a commercial with a cover of a < PROPMALE > and her song . It sounded awful but ahhhh ! < PROPFEMALE > ! 
9 and Beatles Rock Band come out today . Life is good ... too bad I have no money to actually buy and play the latter . 
has now joined the masses of the employed ... and already getting ideas on how to spend the money . Oh world with your tempting trinkets . 
First day of work today in too long . Then haircut which is desperately needed and then party all night long ... hopefully things will be ok . 
doesn't know how to feel . 
Time to flex my artistic muscles with a portrait of < PROPFEMALE > Richardson ! 
don't think that was a mosquito bite ... 
so much for not waking up in horrible pain . 
oh fluff and stuff . 
Ugh my head hurts but I'm excited to go to painting class tonight and then mourn < PROPFIRST > Swayze by watching To Wong Foo , Thanks For Everything , < PROPFEMALE > Newmar . PS . < PROPFIRST > Gibson from Laugh-In died today :( 
had a great experience in Naperville tonight . 
Sundays can always be made better by a marathon of Law and Order : SVU 
loves the fact that I can listen to ONE < PROPFIRST > Sondheim song in the time it takes me to get to work . 
Oh , weight loss faerie ... please visit me . 
Happy Mabon ! The rest of the year is officially going to start sucking , cold weather and all it brings ... I curse you ! 
< PROPMALE > needs to stop being a jerk < PROPFEMALE > and throwing his food through the floor slats . 
is a Super Trouper . 
Carefule the tale you tell , that is the spell . Children will listen . 
feels crappy today , wish I could just go home and read/sleep . 
one of my very best friends is doing a music video , he needs people Oct . 7 from 2-7pm . If you are interested you can let me knkow and I'll give you more details . 
I curse you , Autumn . You and your stupid cold weather and need to have people think of stupid holidays that are two or three months away . Bah ! 
is not looking forward to reading about EVERYON'ES opinion on the Olympic decision via Facebook status updates in the next two days . 
Woah , SVU ... you're blowing my mind and you're only two episodes in . 
All I want is like two freking days to spend with my husband . Is that really too much to ask ?! 
is a big fat lump with a headache . 
loves the gloom and doom . Why can't it be 20 degrees warmer ? 
* sigh * why am I never satiated when I should be ? This causes a frustrated and cranky me . grrrrr 
Don't know which brat did it but one of my rabbits chewed up my shoe lace . Now I have one really short one and my shoe isn't tied all the way . Devils they are ! 
Oh I just want to be wrapped in a blanket , drinking tea and reading Victorian literature . 
Lunch with the best second mom ever :) Then a whole day with < PROPMALE > , finally ! 
There simply are not enough hours in the day in which to be creative . 
just took a giant leap . 
I am going to meet < PROPFEMALE > Andrews tonight . One of my biggest dreams is coming true ! 
I TOUCHED < PROPFEMALE > ANDREWS AND SHE CALLED ME BARONESS !!!!!!!!!! 
F*@%K !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Today can suck it and so can this damn insurance . 
Life in general ... fuck you . 
I know what I want isn't going to happen but that doesn't stop me from wishing it would ... we shall see . 
I'd be pretty fucking impressed if this day got ANY better . 
Answering phone and trying to be professional sucks when you have hiccups . 
Working on my Halloween costume . Look at me go with my mad non-existent sewing skills . 
Thank you Saw < PROPFEMALE > for making up for the last two movies . 
In a ton of pain but visions of Saw traps make me smile through it . 
Ow ! Not cool body ... not cool at all . 
horror movies and Chinese food with my dear < PROPMALE > . 
This is the first time I don't have party plans for Halloween ... I feel naked . 
Scream Awards tonight !! 
Finished my costume last night ! Now for a quest to find some place to wear it ... 
I just got < PROPMALE > the BEST Halloween gift ever ! 
Why can't Halloween be Christmas ? Screw Christmas , This is Halloween !! 
Happy Samhain and remember , everyone's entitled to one good scare . 
Had a great time last night , I met < PROPFEMALE > Garr ! But alas , Halloween is over yet your spirit lives on in the hearts of demonic children everywhere . 
Best thing about November ? Having < PROPFEMALE > Bonham-Carter on my calendar for a whole month !! Thank you < PROPMALE > Potter . 
The pic of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Neuwirth as Gomez and Morticia is adorable ! I can't wait . 
American McGee's < PROPFEMALE > for xbox will be out in 2011 . 
( 304 ): yes , the chronicles of narnia is exactly what happens when you do crack inside of a wardrobe . 
I put on some make-up , turn on the eight track , I'm pulling the wig down from the shelf ... 
annoyed and feels like roadkill . 
wants a baking hutch . 
is sick . Joy . 
I bet Bellatrix never had the problem of getting rabbit fuzz all over her nice evil black clothes . 
The Addams Family musical has a spread in Vanity Fair * giggle * 
I had an awesome dream that I was playing Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd ... Patti LuPone's version . My dreams kick ass . 
Got my first haircut by a man today . LOVE IT ! Now off to sign papers for our new apartment . 
I left my Gothic Beauty magazine at home :( I want it here with me . 
I just want to spend my time shopping online for corsets , tons of antique home decor and other accessories that I have no money for . 
More moving today , may decide to finish it all this weekend . 
new apartment = no internet for a while . Thank you work for letting me feel connected to the world ! 
I don't feel so well today . If I puke on my work space , I apologize for being gross . 
I want everything in my apartment put away now so I can draw and put pictures in albums ... may still puke though . 
headaches make me cranky ! 
Sorry < PROPFIRST > , nothing too fun to update on other than I REALLY want HPHBP right NOW !.... and the wind almost knocked me down again today . 
Catching up on my SVU today . And I suppose unpacking things but SVU is way more important . 
* cries * pain pain go away come again never or I may just jump off a bridge . 
genius plan ... sure it's completely unnecessary and makes me a complete nerd but it shall entertain me . 
I would like to watch a movie tonight but my overflowing laundry basket disagrees with me . Laundrette , here I come . 
I would like to be at home drawing and drinking tea but my brain wouldn't want to let me anyway . 
Don't know why I am so dizzy . This concerns me , especially because I'm just sitting . 
Happy Yule ! Tonight calls for meat pies and tons of candles ... maybe after I get this nauseous feeling to go away . 
My breakfast wound up in the toilet ... after it had decided it did not want to live in my stomach . I think more is on the way out . 
Still cranky due to how oblivious people can be . 
Our poor little guinea pig hurt his eye , it's blood red with a film over it . I think he punctured it and he will probably stay blind in that eye . Poor fuzzy thing . 
Everyone should check out my friend < PROPMALE > Crean's new album \Lovers and Other Kinds of Monsters\ " on either cdbaby.com or itunes " 
Life is like a patio door , you never know which side is open ... and then you walk into the glass . 
why do I only want to draw when I'm extremely depressed ? 
Thank you < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for making me realize I don't always have to be perfect , I can just let it out . And thank you < PROPMALE > for the most beautiful book that is helping me realize this . 
A fever is on the way . Yeah cause being sick is exactly what I need right now . 
is so happy my fever only lasted one day . This is a new record for me ! 
I missed seeing < PROPFEMALE > AND < PROPFIRST > Duchovny at the < PROPFEMALE > Globes . BAH !! 
I love < PROPMALE > . 
I've got dead roses and a spider fruit basket adorning my kitchen . You can tell I live here .

The Addams Family makes me smile :) 
Had an awesome dream that I was playing Mrs. Lovett in an outside production alternating scenes with < PROPFEMALE > Bonham-Carter . 
Someone give me a date for the < PROPMALE > Potter theme park so I can plan the vacation of my dreams ! 
Do I care about < PROPFIRST>'s Day ? Not in the least . Will I pretend to just to have an excuse to see The Wolfman ? Hell yes ! 
Just saw The Wolfman , I liked it and I love < PROPFIRST > Hopkins :) Sad to think all those teenagers are probably there due to a horrid virus called Twilight . 
I WILL finish my drawing today . If I do not , I give you all permission to kick me in the head . 
thinking about American McGee's < PROPFEMALE > for Xbox 360 . This needs to happen sooner than next year . 
Just saw < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > on < PROPMALE > Ferguson . How can a convo that has nothing to do with anything be so adorable ? 
Begining work on < PROPFIRST>'s birthday present . 
I woke up to mu kitchen sink and evrything underneath flooded . It also leacked to the cabinets beside the sink . Valves didn't work , food was lost , I got soaked . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Scully ! 
put the bass in your walk . 
Yeah I watched < PROPMALE > the Duck last night , what of it ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Thompson and I had a conversation about her beautiful silver cuff bracelet with the drama masks on them . That ranks up there with < PROPFEMALE > Andrews calling me Baroness . 
Last night I witnessed < PROPFEMALE > Lupone sing Everything's Coming Up Roses from Gypsy . GYPSY !!! It was breathtaking . 
I hate cleaning because when I do I don't eat unti I'm done . I'm now going to sit my ass on the couch , find a small thing to eat and watch Life Goes On . 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland made me giddy with delight . Especially < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > . Best line in the movie , \Jabber-baby-wocky . \"" 
It's all < PROPFEMALE > and pretty outside my bedroom window . It looks like the scene from The Exorcist when Father Merrin comes to see < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ovarian cyst pain yesterday : horrible . Today : pretty much gone . Stop doing this to me , body ! You confuse me . 
< PROPFEMALE > Moore has to be one of the most beautiful women on the face of this planet . Other than Xindy Rock of course . 
I know where I'm going for my next piercing . 
Rectum ? Damn near killed him . 
OOOOWWWWW wtf ?!?! Someone make my awful pain go away . Please ?! 
I want to go hide in my bed and have someone punch me in the face so pain will be directed elsewhere . 
* grumble grumble grumble * 
just can't cut a break . 
* hide in a hole * wait , I can buy goth-y things . My night has slightly improved . 
The sound of a body falling down or down the stairs fills me with such joy . 
I'm getting so very excited to get my birthday piercing . 
Blast ! I did not win < PROPFEMALE > LuPone contest to name her book . I guess I just have to find another way to kidnap her . I meant \meet \"..." 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > might be doing a stop motion version of the Addams Family . I think my brain is broken . I cannot convey how good my life will be if that happens . 
( 214 ): decided to have an easter egg hunt this year . the < PROPFEMALE > egg has weed in it and all the others have shots of vodka . who said we were too old for easter ?!? 
( Im)patiently waiting for my new corset . 
I'm being very cautious about today and doing nothing that involves cleaning . Exercise , get nails done , draw , watch the Sox game and read some Batman : Vampire . Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I got my piercing ! Shenanigan #1 is taken care of . 
At spin . shenanigan 2 commence ! 
Thank you for all the birthday wishes . I actually had a good one if you can believe it . 
I got my new RED corset today . I should be a superhero and wear corsets all the time . Now thanks to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , I know where to buy my superhero supplies . 
Today is one of those days where I need to kill things in a horrific way and leave them as an awful , bloody mess . Also , I have songs from Shock Treatment stuck in my head . 
When I get home the hot glue gun and sewing machine are making their final touches . Also , banshees and lavafish . Damn those lavafish . 
Just found out < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > died . I am sad and should watch Designing Women and Diff'rent Strokes . 
Off to Spin for < PROPFIRST>'s birthday . Then it's time to do the Time Warp again at the Music Box . If you need something to do tonight come see The < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show ! 
Eating in large groups of people disgusts me . Eating in small groups of people disgusts me . Eating in general is completely disgusting . I feel like < PROPFEMALE > from Girl , Interrupted . 
Nothing to do tonight ? Come see the < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show in Wilmette . Naked people and people in drag ! How can you resist ? 
Not cool , life . Not cool at all . 
The time has come , to Lip Sync for Your LIFE !! RuPaul's Drage Race season finale at 8 . Don't f***k it up Jujubee or < PROPFEMALE > ! 
At least the thought of < PROPFEMALE > going on tour again is bringing down my frustration . 
My head hurts and all that is repeating in it is , \beans let . \"" 
mmmm < PROPFEMALE > chips and hummus for lunch . Don't be jealous of my boogie . 
And so it begins . Late spring/summer night compulsive over exercising . 
Happy Beltane ! a time of ' ... unashamed human sexuality and fertility . '

Happy 1013 to all of my fellow X-Philes ! It couldn't happen on a more perfect day . Also Happy Birthday to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and the most beautiful man in law enforcement , Fox Mulder . 
The new < PROPMALE > Potter posters use the X-Files tag line , \Trust No One . \ " This makes me happy on X-Files day " 
I saw a very dead thing on the road on my way to work this morning and just now thought of it and got sad . Roadkill PTSD . 
Packing is easy ; except for the whole clothes/shoes part . 
We have a Vespa for the day . 
Having dinner with < PROPMALE > Marley 
Getting ready to go to some extreme haunted houses . I'm < PROPMALE>'s bodyguard for the rest of the night . 
Today is the day . I'm going to Hogwarts . 
Is home now but will continue to act asthough on vacation . 
The only purple I own were two small ribbons I had to cut off of something else . Better than nothing . 
Feels like an awful person for eating at McDonald's for 3 meals on vacation but it was the only option since we had no transport and there were waffles involved . Waffles ! 
Good to know I still have a great amount of blood in my refrigerator for the upcoming Halloween festivities . 
Loves coming home to corsets in my mail ! 
Am I dressed as the leech woman from Puppet Master right now ? Why yes I am . 
< PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show tonight at Wilmette ! 
A Meijer commercial just scared me . The employees were in Halloween costumes doing various things , a woman closed a freezer door and the reflection of a cown was behind her . * shiver * 
Anyone planning to see The < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show this Friday or Saturday get your tickets now ! ( It's cheaper in advance and if you come you get to see me as a blonde ! ) 
Work dragged by today but it's finally the Halloween weekend ! Time for < PROPMALE > Horror and just plain horror . 
Two great nights of my first Halloween < PROPMALE > Horror shows . North Halsted parade tonight and party it up ! 
Watching the Addams Family while getting my costume and make-up on . 
What a wonderful Samhain weekend ! Last night was awesome . Sorry it's over :( 
Is anybody interested in buying a white love seat from Ikea from us ? It's aprox 56 inches wide . Used , probably needs a slipcover because < PROPMALE > has this little habit of knocking things over .

Just watched Believe : The < PROPFIRST > Izzard Story . My love for him just doubled and he makes me want to believe in myself again . 
Mmmmmm delicious plain oatmeal for lunch ... 
Against my better judgment I watched a clip from < PROPMALE > Potter in Malfoy Manor . I become more in love with < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > every time I see her . 
Mmmm I hear pitchers of Absolute lemonade calling my name . 
Tonight's movie to fall asleep to , Hannibal . 
It's so nice to be at work and not < PROPFEMALE > back on my hair every five minutes nor get it caught in everything . 
Big headache , big sadness , too much work to do . Can't wait to go home and take solace in my bed and not come out . 
I love the feeling of transcending hunger but hate the diziness that comes with it . 
I've been counting down the days until < PROPMALE > Potter . I just now realized how close 8 days is . Time to go into super nerd mode and fix up my Bellatrix costume . 
I was a fool for never having purchased a Bellatrix action figure * bangs head on desk * She would keep me company at work . 
Live recording of the < PROPMALE > Potter premiere . < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > . Must hold back my squeals of delight . I want to keep her forever . 
I am in love with Hannibal Lector 
I'm missing the live stream of the NY premiere of < PROPMALE > Potter . Curses ! 
< PROPMALE > and I just witnessed on Mugglenet the countdown to the < PROPMALE > Potter release turn over to 3 days 3 hours 33 minutes 33 seconds . It's a sign of some kind , I know it ! 
* grumble grumble * RAWR ! Time to sew . 
You filthy half-blood ! 
Just heard < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > say , \Twilight blows ... boo-ya\ " in an American accent . This day is going to be awesome . " 
If you know someone who lost their dress in the < PROPFEMALE>'s Bridal fire please let me know . I have a size 6 unaltered dress that has never been worn . Pics available . 
< PROPMALE > Potter is almost here !! 
Sitting down for < PROPMALE > Potter ... dressed as Bellatrix 
< PROPMALE > Potter was ... * faint * AMAZING ! Best one yet and Bellatrix just gets better and better . 
I have the opening theme from < PROPFIRST > Scissorhands stuck in my head . 
Bedtime movie for tonight : Hellraiser 2 
Just received Bellatrix's necklace in the mail . Now to obtain that beautiful knife of hers . 
Let's try this again without falling asleep this time . Time for Hellraiser 2 
< PROPFEMALE > Drake 
Time for The Walking Dead ! 
watching < PROPMALE > Caspian . Still looking for my way to Narnia . 
Was momentarily covered in very cold fake blood . Now my skin is kind of pinkish . 
I don't where my charcoal paper is and now is about the time where I really want it before I cut a bitch . 
Just had my heart crushed but saved $500 in the process . 
Accio < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Drinking Hypnotiq on an empty stomach didn't make me feel as good as I thought it would . 
I'm thankful to have two great people I can mess around with and watch horror movies on a day where people < PROPFEMALE > around too much extra stress and make the day not fun at all . 
HAHA ! Suck it everyone else , yesterday was Thanksgiving and I STILL lost weight ! 
I don't have a nifty phone that does this for me so I'll do it manually . < PROPFEMALE > is at the Metro . 
sick today , my throat hurts and my voice is gone . It seems like a good day to fall in and out of sleep while listening to the beautiful voice of < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > . 
Today I watched Lady < PROPFEMALE > , Where Angles Fear to Tread , Till Human Voices Wake Us , Big Fish and I'll fall asleep to < PROPMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > has made me smile all day but I think I now have a fever . 
I'm watching movies that are giving me fond memories of playing Red Rover as a theatre warm-up and our whole group not being able to hit the notes of Greensleeves . 
I want to know why Mulder wasn't more suspicious about Scully's vast knowledge of a < PROPMALE > and Bullwinkle episode . 
Anyone that's on DeviantART should follow me . I need minions . Look for MSRxphile . Go . 
So I wound up at Spin . Happy Wednesday 
Lesson learned : always keep an emergency corset and pair of thigh highs in < PROPMALE>'s car . 
Thanks < PROPFIRST > , now I have the Neverending Story song in my head . 
The < PROPMALE>'s Speech isn't playing anywhere in Chicago . Sad < PROPFEMALE > . 
I really want to watch Mermaids . Come on six o'clock!!

New drink creation : vodka and pixie sticks 
I really need to own < PROPMALE > ( the mini series from 2008 ) on DVD . 
Just fished watching the movie < PROPFEMALE > . I love < PROPFEMALE > Moore !

Best undercover names of all time : < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Petri ... like the dish . 
When I wear my short sweater dresses and tights I feel like shadow Link . 
At the dentist yesterday all I could think of was Hermione at the Slug Club talking about how a kid bit her dad . 
Leaving work to go home and join the tamale making craziness already in progress thanks to the wonderful < PROPMALE > . 
Last batch of tamales are steaming . They're so delicious ! 
I agree with my dentist , I need a bite guard . 
Watching Let Sleeping Corpses Lie with my lovely < PROPMALE > . 
Today seems like a Gremlins kind of day after work . 
The Tempest starring < PROPFEMALE > Mirren ? Yes , please !! 
Watching the Christmas episode of the X-Files with < PROPMALE > and Xindy . We turned it into a drinking game :) 
\Billy ... billy I know what you did ! Where's < PROPFEMALE > Billy ?!? \ " :D " 
Finally have a mouth guard . Let's see if this helps . 
Well < PROPMALE > fell asleep on my leg and I'm wide awake . Not cool to leave a girl awake and bored . 
Should have done it last night . Now the urge to play < PROPFEMALE > is overpowering . 
With < PROPMALE>'s family again . Then perhaps going out to enjoy the lunar eclipse that may or may not be visible . 
Happy Winter Solstice everyone !! 
Pulling out my meat grinder and getting to work on my meat pies for a delicious Yule dinner . 
And now for the holiday movie of the evening : Silent Night , Deadly Night

I received Poltergeist over the holidays from my mom . Why haven't I watched it yet ? 
Bowled the best game of my life tonight . 
I can't wait for warm weather , the batting cages are calling my name . 
Shooting zombies doesn't have the appeal it did earlier today . But drinking a lot seems like a fantastic idea . 
Just got pulled over with four people in the car because of a burnt out headlight and < PROPMALE > being the honest guy he is told the cop we're going to a porn store . 
Waiting is difficult when I know I don't have to but I should . All good things to those who wait . 
I wish my life was as romantic as I make it out to be in my head . 
I've unintentionally lost 10 pounds in the past couple of months . Yay ? 
I am completely in love with The < PROPMALE>'s Speech . < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > is the movie screen live of my life and < PROPMALE > Firth has made it to my list of favorites .

I really wanted to go to class tonight :( And insurance companies are closed today so I can't do my job . But what's this ? < PROPFEMALE>'s biography ? I guess I know what I'm reading all the way through today . 
Cable went out and I missed < PROPFEMALE > on Leno . Curse you snow !! I'll drown my sorrows in some < PROPFEMALE > Huston in the Witches .

1992 version of Dracula may not be the best movie but < PROPFIRST > Oldman , < PROPFIRST > Hopkins and < PROPFIRST > Elwes are in it . A good way to fall asleep . 
Why is it so hard to find clothes I'll actually like and wear that don't cost over $100 ?! 
* giggle * Jabber-Baby-Wocky 
< PROPMALE > and I are going to watch Night of the Living Dead since it was filmed in Pittsburg and we could care less about football . Go whatever Pittsburgh's team is . 
Mugglecast :D 
Time for the Charisma , Uniqueness , Nerve and Talent to shine through in my fantasy team ! 
Finished reading < PROPFEMALE>'s biography . There were many , many tears . 
Point of odor , < PROPFEMALE > stinks .

\ 
We take this day to remember that all of us are equal , regardless of race , gender , sexual orientation , gender identity , age , religion , or magical ability . 
Falling asleep to Dracula yet again . There's just something about the atmosphere of the movie I can't get enough of . 
Two of the people I love most are here , Xindy and < PROPMALE > !! 
Turning the Neverending Story 2 into a semi dining game is probably one of our better ideas . Erase those memories of the third movie !! 
I only hope that in the end you will see \ 
It's the Opheliac in me 
Nothing to do tonight ? Come see < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show at the Music Box Theatre at midnight . I'll be the one stripping for your pleasure . 
Contemplating how I want to redecorate the bedroom ... 
I'm sort of sick of not being appreciated properly . 
Time for a change . 
I wish a faun would come and take me away . 
Felling extremely dizzy . This is one of those days it would be nice to have a fainting couch . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Scully 
Third day on hold with a Puerto Rican insurance . Let's see if today will be less than an hour hold .

Today is Self-Injury Awareness Day . Talk about it , reach out , ask for help , or continue to celebrate your recovery . We're in this together . 
Oh dear , the contents of my stomach are seriously threatening to spill out of my mouth . 
I have a combination of Beethoven's 7th Symphony and < PROPFEMALE > Autumn's Opheliac stuck in my head . 
It's bikini weather inside my apartment . 
I have four days to receive my hat in the mail . I'm getting rather impatient . 
Want to drown everything in alcohol and buying clothes . 
Skinny fat ? Yeah , I think that's a good description of a certain me . 
I have an awful sickening feeling that has everything to do with me being paranoid . Being crazy is exhausting . 
Make love , not horcruxes . 
I had a dream I was cuddly best friends with < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > and now I have a grapefruit for breakfast and I get my < PROPMALE > later . I'm in a great mood so far :) 
Successfully moved < PROPMALE > back ... just the two of us . Now to drop off the truck , eat and then < PROPMALE > Horror tonight !

Most underrated lines from the < PROPMALE > Potter movie series , \ 
Ginny : Mommy have you seen my jumper ? \ 
Mrs Weasley : Yes dear , it was on the cat . 
It is our choices that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities . -Albus Dumbledore 
Drag Race had < PROPFEMALE > as the lip sync song for tonight ! My squeals of delight were plentiful . 
RIP Miss < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
Drank a bottle of sparkling wine , made cinnamon roll cookies and played Sorry . Love you , Xindy . 
< PROPMALE>' new theory , I'm not < PROPFEMALE>'s daughter , I'm the love child of Bellatrix and Snape . 
Hmmm , my pen ran out of ink . How practical would it be to use my < PROPFEMALE > Skeeter Quick Quotes Quill at work from now on ? 
I need a haircut next week . Dare I say bangs are going to make an appearance < PROPFEMALE>'s life again for the first time since being 7 ?? 
She was nothing soft and fragile that needed to be cradled and worshiped . 
I am LuPwned . 
Just went from mediocre vodka to low shelf vodka . My nose burns . 
I got home to find the second X-Files movie on tv . Mulder and Scully in bed * squeal * 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Weasley ! 
10 days until a new piercing . 
I love having < PROPMALE > home on a Saturday . 
I finally found a < PROPMALE > Potter calendar I like . < PROPFEMALE > is the feature for the month of April . Why do I always get the pictures I least want for my birthday ? 
Is it possible to hope for something so much that you develop a headache ? I think yes . 
Feeling rather melancholy ... in a good way . 
All my HP fans that are online , go to MTV's website . They have live streaming with the stars for the release of Deathly Hallows and the exhibition in NYC . 
I want more < PROPFEMALE > dreadfuls in my life . 
Started the day off in pain . I had to put in an extra hole on another belt of mine , I got a slurpee , pretty sure I amazed or offended someone with my tights and heard Crimson and Clover on the radio . Today shall be awesome . 
Ahhhhh ! I have bangs ! They still get pushed to the side but they're there !! 
Just made myself happy . Four day until piercing #10 ! 
Hallmark is going to have an original movie , The Shunning . A Puritan version of a classic horror story ? 
Let the birthday debauchery commence !!! 
Ummm yeah , good birthday weekend so far . 
Head us spinny , there are leftover tortilla chips , pictures if < PROPMALE > on the floor and I fell asleep in my corset . Awesome night , thank you everyone who came out ! 
Does Hogwarts have a gym ? 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes . Been stuck at work so far but I'm leaving soon and then off to get microdermal #2 ! 
Every time I eat I feel like I've put no food in my stomach . I can't believe I'm saying this ... I'm looking forward to eating dinner . 
Last day of sign language class . I'm performing the Neverending Story theme song . You wish you were this cool . 
Looks like plans for the summer will be batting cages , pick up games and burlesque classes . 
This pizza sucks . It's about as filling as eating a piece of paper . 
Making my wig look pretty for another Rocky-tastic weekend . 
Guess who is overly excited today ? ME !! Guess why ? < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is out today !!!! 
Nothing to do tonight ? Come to the Wilmette theatre to see The < PROPMALE > Horror Picture show complete with crazy shadowcast ! It's a guaranteed good time and you don't even have to wear pants !

Come see the < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show tonight at the Music Box . I get stripped down , people lose their virginity , it's a good time ! 
Just watched Wings of the Dove . Kind of want to curl in a blanket and cry my eyes out for a couple days . 
Finally able to buy new sunglasses to replace the ones I've had for four years . In true < PROPFEMALE > fashion I'm buying a pair of shoes instead . Totally worth it . 
Snape , Snape , Severus Snape . 
Chaz Bono is going to be on RuPaul's Drag Race tonight !!!!! 
86:10:52 until the end of the world 
You confuse me facebook . Since I like Frankenstein I should like The < PROPMALE>'s Speech ? It's true and I think I know where you're coming from but I still raise my eyebrow at you . 
Watching Order of the Phoenix with one of the most awesome people in the universe , Xindy !!

day 10 - a song that makes you fall asleep :\ 
Music doesn't make me fall asleep . I can't help but listen to it and sing along . Even classical music keeps me awake . I like to picture huge orchestras and the individual sections of instruments playing . 
I may be missing < PROPFIRST > Mateo at Spin but I don't want to miss < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Excellent night . Good sleep ahead . 
My day just got AWESOME ! My boss found < PROPMALE > Potter word searches and now they are in my possession being solved . 
Just saw the trailer premiere of the Deathly Hallows Part 2 . OH . MY . GOD . And ... Molly vs Bellatrix !!!! 
Since when can I see my spine through my back without really bending over too much ?! 
Wait ... Helena Bonham < PROPMALE > may be cast in a ( second ) movie version of < PROPMALE > Miserables ?? Commence squeals of delight in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... OMG !! 
Just watched Twelfth Night . My brain hurt hearing Shakespearian prose in the Victorian < PROPFEMALE > . Ah well , time for < PROPFEMALE > rehearsal .

Come to the Wilmette theatre tonight and sing along with < PROPFEMALE > and the Angry Inch ! And see me rock out on a guitar :D 
Happy Beltane !! 
Through the grapevine I heard that today is Pagan Coming Out Day . I am a very proud pagan and am very much at peace . 
No more slurpees for me for a while . The sugar , it BURNS ! 
Becoming Chaz , the story of Chaz Bono will premiere May 10 !

Just had horchata spill directly down my shirt and bare leg . Cold ! 
Happy Cinco de Mayo , this calls for a tamale lunch ! 
I was going to go home and nap before visiting my parents but then remembered < PROPMALE > Macejak is living vicariously through me and my Lego < PROPMALE > Potter achievements . Time to get to work . 
I'm a good daughter . My mother is subjecting me to American Idol and I'm not complaining . It's ok , we'll be watching < PROPMALE > Potter soon . 
After seeing Half Blood < PROPMALE > for the first time , my mother seemed a < PROPMALE > concerned that Bellatrix is my favorite character . More so after I told her I loved her before < PROPFEMALE > was even cast a her . That's just a heavenly bonus .
