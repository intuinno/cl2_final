Anyone got a small desk they don't need that I can have ? 
Oh . My . Fucking . God . You asshole deer . I hope your neck broke and you are suffering at the side of the road , writhing in agony while your two asshole deer friends helplessly watch . You deserve it for running all the way across the highway to get in front of me . You should be glad that only hair was on my car . 
< PROPFEMALE > just killed the best person at hide and seek 
I have the best mom in the whole world ! I love her sooooo much !! <3 
How can a baby so small fart so horribly loud ? 
My little girl is watching music videos .

Apparently I am hilarious by 3 month old standards when checking a diaper . 
just applied to teach in the developmental algebra classes . Here's to getting off my ass and trying to get somewhere . 
waiting for an email he desperately needs 
I'm loving these anti-legal immigration commercials . People from Mexico legally gaining citizenship to the U.S. and getting jobs ? * Gasp * What about the white people !?

I Love Rock N Roll is one of the most horrid songs ever . 
Let's see what people talk about more today ; dead < PROPFEMALE > Winehouse or the massacre in Norway

I really should start working on this book lol .. 
got a letter about me getting highest honors on the < PROPFIRST>'s list today 
Another interview next Wednesday . Let's hope this one goes better than the last
