I just thought i would have a very good week and weekend , but know its going to be a pretty bad one . And the #1 cause is school along with the teachers :( 
someone come save me from this horrible mcc .... plus i hate how mcc wont count this semesters credits in order to register .... this is completely and i mean completely stupid 
Finals .... wat to say , wat to say ... i guess the only thing to say is that there to bug you when at home studying , and then when actually taking finals they seem like hard question but there really not 
Hates the Psychology take home test I was given .... 
I going to really hate this week .... I have three finals ... :( 
cal final is out of the way ... and now to focus on two more finals 
Glad school is over ... and enjoying my weekend .

I'm ready for this week to end , and to just have a fun weekend . 
Going to enjoy my weekend 
I am ready for the weekend to be here already , and I'm glad that this summer intercession is almost over . 
Doesn't like speeches when you have to do so much stuff for it .... I can't believe the BlackHawks lost to the Flyers today 
I really hate how speech has all these requirements in order to do a specific speech 
Will never forget and will always remember a great man , great cousin who has been the greatest he could ever be . He had always brought comedy to the family gatherings , and I will always miss it . Will always remember the times when we would < PROPFEMALE > out together as kids , and bug my aunt's and uncle's . I will always remember < PROPFIRST > Hermes , June 23 , 2010 . 
Boston , < PROPFEMALE > is best place to go claming and eating lobster and crab on the beach . 
Most of our obstacles would melt away if , instead of cowering before them , we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them . \

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . Discover . \
