i want potatoes really bad ... 
i feel absolutely terribbble right now 
i feel so bad right now in body and mind i love my husband so much but i feel like im making him hate me .... 
I do not adore death as if I were some idiot groupie to the lead singer\ 
in a band . I approach it with the mixture of fascination/terror/icy\ 
speculation of someone who really knows nothing . I trust , only enough , \ 
to know that I like myself too much to even consider bringing about my\ 
own demise .... 
I just don’t want you to think that he isnt anything\ 
other than a pathetic , human defect . Nothing more . Not a monster , not a\ 
bogeyman . Nothing but another reason to feel better about yourself . \ 
Understand that it’s just a person - not worth devoting any nightmares\ 
to ... 
i want to start web comic and i dont know what about i need ideas people funny maybe ? 
i will never orget the lessons i learned when i was innocent . That to mature to young is to believe in a lie . That the falling of youths to not be able to restrain its own violence . That pain is inevitable suffering is optional That what doesn't kill me makes me stronger , And lastly a journey ends in lover meeting . 
So im having a REALLY tough time right now for about the past 2 weeks , im so scared for my appointment tomarrow im remembering alot of things i probily shouldnt and i cant wait for my insurence to go thru i need to see a doctor 
well woke up at about 6 today feel terrible didnt think it was possible to get sicker 
ugh still feel like shit

turkey hill slushie on the corner of front street in harrisburg sry \

Your life is always the post of something else . \
