Why does everything always have to be so complicated ? 

Why don't people like being called grandma and grandpa any more ??? 
finds out what the baby is Thursday . Have a lot on my mind , and being up alone isn't helping . Being lonely sucks . 
It's a boy . Me and < PROPMALE > are so excited , even tho my < PROPFEMALE > is disappointed he isn't a girl . His official name is Aiden , but he'll always be Baby Baby . 
is feeling the hormone imbalance . Feels like I have a bad case of PMS . It totally sucks . 
is extremely sad . 
just got a call from the census people about a job . But of course my mom got a job the other day and now I have no ride . I hope it somehow works out . $11.50 an hour will be very helpful for when the baby comes . 
today I'm really feeling pregnant . Back is hurting , but I'm happy about having him growing inside of me . =] 
Disco is gone , < PROPMALE > just disappointed me beyond belief , and I'm extremely sad . Life is beginning to look bleak . 
< PROPFIRST > Hutchinson is dead to me . I've put up with his crap before but this affects my baby . I am extremely pissed off . 
made a new friend : a red cocker spaniel named Chevy . 
had an awesome day with < PROPMALE > , Census people called and I start training tomorrow , and I'm feeling pretty great . 
Training is going good but I won't get paid for awhile and that poses a huge problem . May have a temporary solution if a certain douche bag will work with us and give me time to save some money up . 
dreamed last night about an owl . It looked at me , turned it's head almost all the way around , then flug it back around to stare at me . When it did that , I woke up . Had to turn the TV on because I was freaked out . For the past month I've been waking up between 4 and 4:30 AM . Don't know what it means . 
thought I was seeing things , but it turns out one of the neighbors pigs is roaming the block . 
Cleaned the whole kitchen for the second day in a row . 
Tuesday is my due date and my cervix is still closed . No progress what-so-ever . Wasn't worried earlier but now I'm getting nervous . 
I love being a mommy ! 
“Never let go of hope . One day you will see that it all has finally come together . What you have always wished for has finally come to be . You will look back and laugh at what has passed and you will ask yourself ... ' How did I get through all of that ? ” 
< PROPMALE > used all his money he earned today on Aiden : a pack of diaper , four packs of wipes , and batteries for his swing . Then put the left over 56 cents in Aiden's piggy bank . Aiden was happy to see his daddy too . Snuggled on his chest the whole time . 
“Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections . ” 
Aiden rolled over for the first time yesterday , and just did it again this morning . I was so excited I could have jumped up and down cheering . I'm so proud of him . He's growing so fast ! 
Palmetto Street Church of God is the first church I've enjoyed going to . I look forward to it every sunday ! 
LOVE YOUR SISTER week . If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you stumble , cheered you on , and kept you strong , thrown her shoes at you post this . Sisters are a friend forever . Put this on your status if you have an amazing sister . ( < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , love you guys ! ) 
Aiden is four months old today . Where did the time go ? 
Just noticed that Aiden's hair is getting thicker . I was so excited you would have thought I'd won the lottery !!! 
went to the Halloween thing at the church . Aiden rode on a horse with his daddy and played with a box of < PROPFEMALE > . Today was a really good day . 
Aiden rolled from his back to his stomach and back onto his back last night for the first time . It was amazing . 
Aiden is 5 months old today . 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! 
Had a long night with Aiden . He was up crying until about three and finally passed out on my shoulder . We got seven hours of uninterupted sleep , which was nice . He woke up in a good mood , so we had story time ( told him the Three Little Pigs ) and now he's playing with toys . With the good and the bad , I love being a mom .

it's starting to feel like Christmas . =] 
A child is a wonderful thing to have . One smile can brighten up your day . <3 
We took Aiden to see < PROPFEMALE > today . He smiled the whole time ! I was expecting him to freak out . 
July 10th never seemed so far away . </3 
Aiden just walked ( in his < PROPMALE > of course ) all the way across the livingroom and into the kitchen to where < PROPMALE > and I were standing . He grinned the whole time . 
There's a huge hole in my life where < PROPMALE > is suppose to be . I miss him like crazy . 
< PROPMALE > is going to be here tomorrow . I can't sit still because I'm so excited . 
Yeah , uh huh , you know what it is\ 
Black and yellow , black and yellow\ 
Black and yellow , black and yellow 
Aiden is rolling around on the bed , playing with his daddy . I love us being together . 
Parents think about their children day and night . Parents love their children in a way that they will never understand . Parents will be there for their children when no one else will . Parents would take a bullet , jump in front of a train , or ask God to take them instead of their child . I know I would ! If you have a child you love as much as I love mine post this as your status . 
I'm ahead in < PROPMALE > History , about to start Math , and I've dropped Public Speaking . Aiden and I are playing together on the bed and I'm talking to < PROPMALE > on the phone . I miss him like crazy . 
Champagne 
Today was a bad day . All I wanted to do was crawl in my bed and sleep all day . I accomplished nothing , no school work or anything . I hope tomorrow is better . 
Aiden has scooted across the entire bed about three times trying to get my laptop . He actually turns to get in the right direction . He's panting . lol 
Aiden said \ma-ma-ma-ma\ " for the first time last night ! Talk about being estatic . <3 " 
I can't sleep because I keep thinking about being able to talk to < PROPMALE > tomorrow . There has to be a reason for all of this , but I can't figure it out at the moment . All I know is I miss him and it sucks . </3 
</3 
I am finding motherhood difficult today . 
Had a long night with Aiden . He got up every two hours and this morning woke up in a good mood , but started fussing soon after . I finally had to make myself put him down and let him fuss it out . I gave him a bottle of apple juice and now he's asleep , still holding the bottle . 
Aiden's pastimes :\ 
1 . Talking into a cup . \ 
2 . Scrunching up his face and blowing out of his nose like a bull . \ 
3 . Clicking his tounge . 
Please tell me that teaching your baby to go to sleep on his or her own gets easier because it feels harder tonight . 
Nothing like being woken up by some random woman asking for her mail . 
??????????????? ????? ????????????????? \ 
It's Nieces Week ! If you have a beautiful niece or nieces that you\ 
love more than you can describe , copy and paste this to your\ 
status for a little while , but hold them in your heart for a lifetime ! \ 
??????????????? ????? ???????????????? 
I can't talk to < PROPMALE > until the 12th , Aiden's crying and it's breaking my heart , and I have a whole bunch of schoolwork to get done . I feel like crying too . 
My son is addicted to technology and he isn't even eight months yet !!!! 
I'm going to give my fussy baby a bath and then I'll be back . And yes < PROPFEMALE > , that's a threat and you're welcome for the warning ! So , you better be on here !!! <3 
Just got done studying for my math test . Wish me luck on my < PROPMALE > midterm and math test tomorrow . Nite ! <3 <3 <3 
Going to head out around 9 . Hope it doesn't take too long . Both me and Aiden can't stop yawning . 
Just got back . Didn't do all that great on math test , even thought I was sure I had aced it . But I passed both of my tests , so I'm happy . =] 
Is alone . I miss < PROPMALE > more than ever . </3 
My baby-cakes and I have the house to ourselves for a little while . Not necessarily a good thing because it gets lonely . But we'll make do . <3 
Made a 95 on my < PROPMALE > quiz ! Missed one dang question , but I still did great . <3 \ 
WIC tomorrow . 
Get to talk to < PROPMALE > tomorrow ! <3 The excitement is giving me insomnia . 
Waiting and waiting ... 
Just talk to < PROPMALE > for 17 minutes . It just made everything hurt worse . He's gonna call back at nine ... </3 
\It's Bieber 
Aiden has been tugging on his ear all day and has been really fussy . I'm scared he might have an ear infection . =/ 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s day , everyone ! <3 <3 <3 
My baby needs to wake up so I can give him his < PROPFIRST>'s day gift and take some pics !!! <3 
Aiden < PROPFIRST > Matthews is my < PROPFIRST > !!! <3 <3 <3 
A surprise call from a certain somebody just made my day . The nice weather is a plus . =] 
I just wrote < PROPMALE > a love letter . <3 I can't wait until he's here so I can give it to him . 
Aiden discovered how to rip paper . He keeps holding it up and smiling like he's so proud of himself . =] Guess I can't leave my homework where he can get it ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Gray and < PROPFEMALE > Swan need to come visit me and meet my baby !!! And < PROPFEMALE > is a total miser for not having come yet . < PROPFEMALE>'s off the hook ; but not < PROPFEMALE > . Ha-ha ! <3 
Have to go back to WIC monday bc they failed to tell me that the person that handles the vouchers isn't there today . Ugh . Then a group of sniffling people talking about flu shots walked past us , and I was getting nervous bc that's the last thing that we need . Luckily < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > came and got us . Thanks < PROPFIRST > ! 
Unleash the Beast !!! <3 I just drank half of a Monster and now I'm so wired I feel like I could run a marathon . 
Four more days !!! <3 
Monday , hurry up and get here !!! 
Got to talk to my other half today ! He'll be here on Monday . I can't wait ! <3 <3 <3 
< PROPMALE>'s here !!! Got to come early because we had stuff to do in Effinham . I'm so happy ! <3 
I love < PROPMALE > Matthews and I'm so glad he's here !!! <3 
Had a wonderful day with < PROPMALE > Matthews even though my wiggle worm was grouchy today . I'm so glad he's here with us ! <3 <3 <3 
All my baby has done for the past three days is fuss ! He gets up in the middle of the night and screams for hours . I don't know what to do ... =/ 
Six more days ' til I'm 19 !!! Prob not going to do much , but at least I've got the two most wonderful guys in the whole world to spend it with !!! <3 
Aiden's in a better mood today , and he's passed out in his daddy's lap right now . Bout to get off and spend time with my love . <3 
Bout to give my Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > a bath and put him to bed . <3 Then < PROPMALE > and I are going to see if we can find the new episode of Criminal Minds on the computer seeing as somebody comandeered the TV !!!!!! 
Aiden is eight months today ! Time is just flying by . And that is both a good and bad thing . 
< PROPMALE > and I were cooking dinner , so I put Aiden on the floor to play . I glanced over , not a minute later , and my heart dropped because he was gone . He had scooted half way across the room to get a flip-flop . lol 
Stank is asleep , < PROPMALE>'s watching criminal minds , and I'm about to head to bed . I'm so sleepy I can barely hold my eyes open . Night ! <3 
Bout to get a shower and then head to bed with my baby . <3 
Aiden got his first bruise yesterday , and he sat up on his own for the first time today ! I love my Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > . <3 <3 <3 
You know how when you're feeding a baby and you make sounds like a train or an airplane ? My son is scared of the airplane noise !!! He sticks his bottom lip out and starts crying . Oh , but there's a catch . It's only when his daddy does it ! < PROPMALE > did it , Aiden started fussing and reached out for me , so I could grab him and he could hide from daddy . lol 
I just got one of the best birthday presents ever !!!! Aiden's first tooth is coming through ! It on the bottom in the front . You can barely see it , but it's there ! I love my Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 <3 <3 He's growing up so fast ! \ 
Also , thanks to everyone's birthday wishes ! It made my day all that more special ! I feel so loved . =] I had an awesome birthday ! <3 
I am either going today or tomorrow to take my finals for < PROPMALE > and Math , so wish me luck ! I'm finally done ! I'm excited about starting my next two classed : Sociology of the Family and Comparative Religion . Now I'm off to play with my Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > and to study ! <3 <3 <3 
Passed my < PROPMALE > final , but don't even ask about the math . =[ 
Aiden can now get on his hands and knees , but he's not crawling yet . And he stands in the bath tub now ! When he wants something , he's determined !!! <3 
Why has every one of my fiance's ex's sent him a friend request ? And some have sent multiple !!! I mean , geez . Maybe some of them don't mean anything by it , but when two or three is sent after the first was deleted , someone needs to take a hint ! We are stepping away from the past , and having ex's as friends can only cause problems . 
Woke up to Aiden standing in his crib . Now he can do it over and over . <3 
Snuggs is asleep and I'm watching criminal minds with my baby . Still waiting to see if I passed my math class , and still waiting for my totally awesome purse that won't be here until Monday . Dang ! <3 <3 <3 
This is to all the moms : \ 
Aiden woke up with a really snotty nose and a cough . When I wiped his nose the mucus was yellow at first , but now it's clear . He had a < PROPFEMALE > bit of blood in one nostril too ( which was kinda scary ) . It's just running now and still clear . In y'all's opinion , is he getting sick , could it be because he's teething , or is it impossible to know ??? 
Newsflash : I have a term GPA of a 3.5 and I passed my < PROPMALE > class with an A , and math with a B !!! Am I awesome or what ??? lol 
At a motel with Snuggs and my baby ! Gonna have a good day today ! <3 <3 <3 
We had a good weekend . Got to see Larkin and Harper and went shopping for some much needed stuff for me and my Snuggs . <3 < PROPMALE>'s home , but I'm trying not to be too sad . We'll be together again soon . ;) But I sure do miss him ... 
I'm going to trust that this is a blessing from God , and that we're not about to jump from the frying pan into the fire . The consensus is : yes !!! 
“Your time is limited , so don't waste it living someone else's life . Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking . Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition . They somehow already know what you truly want to become . Everything else is secondary . ” 
I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted him as my personal Savior . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father at the gates of Heaven . This is simple ... if you Love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . Just copy and paste ... No shame here . 
Newsflash : Missing battery !!! 
Good stuff is coming my way ! Can't wait for the plans to go through and for us to be reunited ! <3 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .. Be a good sport and play along ... 4 words is harder than you think ......! (Just too funny to pass up ! ) 
Ordered a much need textbook yesterday , and today I get an email telling me that it had already been sold . Sorry , but at least you won't be charged . This is b.s. 
Went by a yardsale like thing and got Aiden a new stroller and a high chair finally ! Both are slightly used , but still in good condition . Plus , it only cost $25 total ! Thanks , < PROPFIRST > , for taking us ! <3 
Tomorrow is the day I've been waiting for for a long time ! We're finally going to be reunited for good . No more sad goodbyes ! I love < PROPMALE > Matthews !!! <3 <3 <3 
Time sure does drag when you're waiting for the love of your life to get here ! Tick tock tick tock ... 
Spending time with < PROPMALE > Matthews and Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > . Bout to get ahead in Comparative Religion . =] 
Hmmm ... Snuggs and I are the only ones up . How did that happen ??? 
Had an awesome day at the park with Aiden and < PROPMALE > Matthews !!! Now I know for sure where Snugg's birthday party is going to be . <3 <3 <3 
I love < PROPMALE > Matthews and Aiden < PROPFIRST > Matthews !!! 
Finally got WIC here and bought a convertible car seat for $25 . I love when I get a good deal ! <3 Gonna go make something to eat with < PROPMALE > and relax . Spending all day at DSS and the Health Department is really drainning . 
Apple with a definite side of grape ! ;) 
God is answering my prayers left and right ! I wish everyone knew that if you only put God first in your life , things will get better ! He is raining down blessings on me , and I am so thankful . <3 
I feel like a true \grown-up\ " now that I have my own banking account and debit card . Being nineteen suuurrre is nice . lol . " 
Been up since a little before eight , and now I'm the only one up . I'm starting to think Aiden does this on purpose . lol <3 <3 <3 
I believe the next tooth Aiden is going to cut is his front left tooth . It's purple in that spot . <3 
A bag of sugar at the store down the road from us cost $15.99 !!! How is that even legal ? 
Chivalry is not dead !!! < PROPMALE > let me step on his foot to get over the raunchy ditch water , so I wouldn't get my new shoes dirty . lol Love you , baby ! <3 <3 <3 
Only GOD can turn a MESS into a MESSage , a TEST into a TESTimony , a TRIal into a ... TRIumph , a VICTim into a VICTory . GOD is GOOD ... all the time . Repost & share if you believe this . 
< PROPMALE > , Aiden , and I went to Walmart to do a little shopping . < PROPMALE > finally got some new clothes , and I got a dress that you can wear six differnt ways . Oh , and got Aiden an infant toothbrush and toothpaste for his new teeth . Had a wonderful day . Loved the weather and got some sun . ? ? ? ? ? 
< PROPMALE > Matthews had Bieber Fever !!!!! 
Today was amazing thanks to < PROPFEMALE > MacDonald and < PROPMALE > Matthews ! And can't forget my Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 I love my lil ' family !! 
Aiden woke up in the best mood ever , my baby , < PROPMALE > , is here with me , and a friend may be coming to visit soon . What more could a girl ask for ? =) 
I'm so sick of the tension , sick of the hunger , sick of you acting like I owe you this . Find another place to feed your greed while I find a place to rest . 
I just want everyone to know that < PROPMALE > Matthews is a wonderful person , a great father , and is totally awesome ! He's doing the best he can with what he has , and I'm a so proud to call him my fiance and the father of our child . I love you , < PROPMALE > ! Forever and after . <3 
Three words : < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Park !!! <3 
Aiden is nine months today . One of the most helpless feelings is when your baby won't eat ... =/ 
Dang . Does it always feel like this ? I feel like I've been going all day , and I'm exhausted . I can't even imagine what it's going to be like when Aiden's walking . 
Why does the pot roast do funky stuff when I cook it ??? 
I really need a break ... 
``n_n\ 
=( ' o ' ) =\ 
To My Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > <3 
Got some inspiration in the mail . =) Really need it for what's going on right now ... 
Uh oh . Drama in the neighborhood ! 
Can see one of Aiden's front teeth through the gum , so it should come throgh soon ! My baby is in some serious pain . =/ I feel bad for him , and at the same time I'm so proud . <3 
Aiden's front tooth is coming through ! =) 
There are socks everywhere !!! All around the crib and in it ! I believe it's time to move Aiden's drawers to where he can't reach them . 
Bruiser can sneeze on command ! =D 
So , I scrunched my hair today while Aiden was taking a nap . When he woke up , he kept giving me this weird look , and then he started crying . He turned into a daddy's boy and kept looking at me like I was a stranger . lol 
Eeek ! Mold !!!!! =/ 
Got Aiden after his nap , and he had somehow taken his pants off . 
Going places tomorrow . Got out of the house for a couple hours today , but I'm still excited about tomorrow . <3 The Simple Life ! <3 
Did a ton of laundry today , and still have more to do tomorrow ! Got rid of the mold issue for the most part , but I'm anticipating it coming back . I just can't wait to move into the new house . So , please pray that everything will work out with it , and that < PROPMALE > and/or my < PROPFEMALE > will be able to get a job . <3 
Finally have a little time to myself ! <3 
I just made a purse out of a shirt ! =D Sure , I got the directions off of a website , but I still feel uber creative !!! <3 
How did I manage to get sunburned on my chest , shoulders , and back , yet my neck is still white as a sheet of paper ??? 
Aiden's nine month checkup was today , and everything is good with him . Doc told me to be proud because he's doing excellent . He didn't have to get shots which I am very greatful for because that would have made him even crankier ! =) I love my Snuggle < PROPFEMALE > . <3 <3 <3 
Aiden is dog-fishing with a tennis ball thrower !!! 
Why would you be friends with someone you claim you can't stand ? That makes no sense ... 
My baby is a big ball of energy , and he wearing me out by making me < PROPMALE > him around the living room . Why do babies want what they're not suppose to have ??? I love my Snuggs , and I really wish I had at least half of the energy he has ! <3 
Aiden screamed for about three hours straight last night ! =/ But he's ok now . < PROPMALE > took Bruiser to get his hair cut , but they wouldn't see him because < PROPMALE > didn't have his shot records . Gotta go to my < PROPFEMALE>'s school , and then probably to get some groceries for the house . Hope everyone has a good day ! <3
