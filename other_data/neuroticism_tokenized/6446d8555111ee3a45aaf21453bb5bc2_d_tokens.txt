If we all become new people in the new year , what happens to the old person ? Do they dissolve into the past ? Do they haunt us like a ghost ? Or do they simply vanish ? 

I FINALLY finished the video project I've been working on for the past week ! TAKE THAT , PROCRASTINATION AND COMMITMENT-ISSUES !!!!! XD XD XD 
So according to Pandora , Vampire Weekend and Green Day are similar bands . Indie pop . Alternative/punk . Um , can we say NO ?! 
\See ? See what happens to you when you don't listen to me ? You die . You die dead . \"" 
EVERYONE IS DYING IN SOUL EATER !!!!!!!!! This entire story arc never happened in the manga so I've been practically screaming with the suspense and SOMEONE JUST DIED !!!!! And next episode is the one where another main character dies , if they keep with the storyline . AAAAAHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!! 
THIS IS SO SCREWED UP !!!!!!!!!!! First they get the entire plot of the past , like , 5 or 10 episodes COMPLETELY wrong , then they add in facts that are IMPOSSIBLE , then this person doesn't die ( for which I am very happy but still annoyed by ) , then they're adding in so much freaking suspense that inside my head I think I've broken a few windows , and it is just SO SCREWED UP !!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M GOING CRAZY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
BOO-YAH !!!!!!! Shinigami-sama just pwned Asura with a Reaper Chop !!!!!! BOO-FREAKIN-YAH !!!!!!!!!!!! 
All I can say about what just happened : EPIC WIN FOR THE 6-YEAR-OLD WITCH . EPIC . WIN . 
I officially hate the Soul Eater anime . Officially . I hate it . I hate it . I hate it . I hate it . This wasn't supposed to happen . It didn't work this way . Everything is wrong . This person doesn't die , and that person isn't supposed to die , and this person is supposed to be somewhere unknown , and that event never happened , and this event was supposed to happen but didn't . So much is wrong with it . I hate it . I hate it . 
I have just finished the Soul Eater anime . I can say that I really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , REALLY love the manga SO MUCH MORE . Too bad the manga isn't done yet and it left off at quite an epic point . Gah . Nothing to watch or read now ... 
just got up ... stayed awake until about 3 A.M. watching Soul Eater . Didn't really like the ending , and I want to know how the heck they're gonna make the second season if the big main bad guys are all dead . The manga is so much better . 
is really freaking ticked of at YouTube and WMG music for not letting me upload the video I spent a total of about 3 days ' worth of hours on . < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin and < PROPMALE > Parot , just know that tomorrow I will be out for blood . Stay at least 1 mile away if you don't want to be at risk . 
thinks her mom is one of the worst people in the world . 
is ... 1 ) sunburned on the tops/fronts of my thighs and all over my back & shoulders , 2 ) rediscovering music I haven't listened to in over six months , and 3 ) FREAKING TIRED . 
< PROPMALE > & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST IS THE MOST AMAZING MOVIE EVER . It has no plot or point , but it's hilarious !!! 
has the sudden urge to go back in time and relive the best moments/minutes/hours/days/weeks of her life . 
I love days like today where all you do is sit around the house in your PJs and watch some of your forgotten favorite movies ... they are quite amazing . Sunburn gone on back/most of thighs , not so much on shoulders ... ugh . 
is terribly confounded by a personal problem . 
I HATE MY COMPUTER !!!!!!! It won't play videos or sound !!! I mean , the sound is on and it works , but it just won't do anything !!!!!!!!! 
is finding the various cover arts for her favorite music albums of all time to make a background for her computer . might even put it on fb if i can ... 
I HAVE OFFICIALLY SUCCEEDED IN CREATING AN AMAZING PICTURE !!!!! THIS IS SOOOO COOL !!!!! ( Everyone else probably won't think it's all that great , but I think it's amazing , given my lack of technological knowledge !!! ) 
is full of spaghetti and BORED OF SUMMER . 
is using my mom's iMac because she said I could . 
one word : FREERICE . 
Goodnight world , I'm turning my mind over to the waves of sleep that I yearn for . Don't worry--I'll come back tomorrow ! 
Going to < PROPFEMALE>'s today ! :D 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s house , enjoying the change of scenery ! 
Got home from < PROPFEMALE>'s an hour ago , took a REALLY long shower , is now munching on Doritos and listening to Boys Like Girls ... 
WANTS TO SCREAM LOUDLY AND PUNCH A WALL AND SMASH MY STUPID FREAKING GOOD-FOR-NOTHING PIECE-OF-CRAP CAMERA INTO INFINITESIMAL PIECES BECAUSE EVEN WITH THE SOFTWARE IT CAME WITH THE PICTURES WILL NOT UPLOAD ONTO THIS STUPID OLD OUTDATED CRAPPY COMPUTER LIK 
has learned that sitting on the couch simultaneously listening to my iPod , watching The West Wing , and reading a book does nothing to calm my anger for this crappy computer . 
is having fun laughing at random flair ... XD 
I think that The Real Housewives of New Jersey is a fantastically stupid show ( but I still love it ! ) and my mom/sister are two of the worst people in the world . 
wants to go somewhere cool . If anyone wants to abduct me and take me to , like , the mountains or the Northwest Pacific coast , feel free ! 
feels ... um ... anyone want to tell me how I feel ? ' Cause I don't know . 
is fuming . 
REALLY wants to kill a certain person right now . Can't say who . 
is recuperating from the party last night ... I think I had enough sugar to last me 20 years , and we still have BOXES and BOXES of Little < PROPFEMALE > snacks ... anyone want to help eat them ? :P 
\Who said that it's better to have loved and lost/I wish that I had never loved at all \"" 
I feel all special and healthy and fit ' cause I spent an hour on Wii Fit ! :D 
BAKED ZITI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Wow , Trigger is so fat ... :O 
nom nom nom . 
< PROPFEMALE > JACUMIN NEEDS TO CHECK OUT THE FLAIR I SENT HER !!! :D 
RAWR . 
is laughing her butt off at the D . Gray-Man Abridged Series on YouTube ... \It's so fun it'll make you want to jump in a pool of WASABI !!! With < PROPFIRST > MURPHY !!!!! \"" 
Go to YouTube . Look up D . Gray-Man the Abridged Series . Watch Episode 3 from 1:40 to 2:05 . Watch Episode 4 from 6:16 to 6:50 . Watch all of \Exorcists On a Boat\ " . LAUGH UNTIL YOU DIE . " 
Back from being out all day ... 
Dude . If it's an anime/manga , it has a Caramelldansen . I'm serious . Go to Google Images and look up \caramelldansen\ " and you'll see what I mean . ( I FOUND OBAMA AND < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE >!!!!!!)" 
I need a new iPod ... 
going to play Uno with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > Crews ... it's better than sitting around reading manga online , which is pretty much all I've been doing this summer ! :P 
Just got back from the Crews ' house & I'm going back over once we all eat dinner ! ( < PROPFEMALE > Crews is the coolest 9-year-old in the world -- she has Vans [ the canvas , no laces type ] and high-top < PROPMALE > Taylors !!! :D ) 
just came back from the Mart of Wal ... the lady pretty much put everything in its own bag !!! What a waste . 
knows a good torture method , if anyone's interested . 
Whoa . 4th of July came quickly . 
is exceptionally mad . 
just got back from a pretty fun party @ the Crews ' house ! 
can't sleep . 
Dude . Did anyone else know that < PROPMALE > Grint had swine flu ?! 
at her grandmother's house , taking loads of pictures of the < PROPFEMALE > doorknobs ( no , this is not a mansion , it's just really old ) , the flowers , and the cats . Well , it would be cats if I could find Macon , but I can only find Molly ... oh well . 
is going to go pass out on her bed and probably won't wake up in time for dinner ... oh well . 
I am in love with the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack(s ) . I want all 3 , plus the soundtracks for < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE>'s Infinite Playlist and Sweeney Todd : Demon Barber of Fleet Street . 
Don't you hate it when you have more than 2 songs stuck in your head at once ? I have to have at least 4 !!! AND ONE OF THEM IS \CARAMELLDANSEN\ " !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
still has Caramelldansen in my head . SAVE ME NOW . 
< PROPFEMALE > !!!!! COME SAVE ME FROM THE PIT OF DESPAIR AND BOREDOM !!!!! COME BAAAAAAAAACK !!!!!!!!!!! I need someone to entertain me with stupid D . Gray-Man : The Abridged Series references ... * sniffsniff * 
I can't sleep . Again . Am I developing insomnia , or is this just my body's stupid inability to relax enough for me to sleep before midnight ? 
bored , about to take a pair of scissors and chop off all my hair . Orthodontist in 2 days ... ugh . 
More pics tomorrow ! 
just realized how crappy online manga is . The translators do a really bad job sometimes ... I mean , REALLY bad . 
< PROPMALE > movie Potter mara ... wait , what ? 
Orthodontist in ... however long 9:40 is from now . 
BORED . 
The finales of seasons 3 and 4 of Bones always make me want to hit something out of frustration ... in the first case , because < PROPMALE > gets pretty much arrested . In the latter , because the first 42 minutes of the entire 45 minutes of the show is a waste of < PROPMALE > 
I found a creative way to not get bored and mad at the computer when it's being slow ... DRAW CHIBIS !!! :D 
Making random chibi things on Paint . Right now I'm doing people from D . Gray-Man , next I'll probably do random friends . Maybe people from another manga series , Ranma 1/2 . 
WE HAVE OFFICIALLY LIVED IN UNION COUNTY FOR TWO YEARS . ... Man , I'm depressed ... 
Doing more random crap on Paint . ( I can't decide how to do this one chick's eyes ... it's so hard !!! ) 
< PROPMALE > Potter later , maybe Border's . 
liked HP6 , but was still disappointed in it . 
TWO . MORE . WEEKS . UNTIL . BEACH !!! 
can finally get my pictures onto the computer DIRECTLY instead of putting them on the old laptop and using a memory stick to transfer them ! 
There is lightning and thunder . It is very loud . WE HAD THE BEST PIZZA FOR DINNER !!!!! 
Computer is spiffied up , still won't play videos or sound from the Internet ( even though we downloaded Flash 10 ) , but whatever -- I hardly use either . :D 
helped clean the office today , I really wish my computer would play YouTube ! 
I found the sheet music to play the \House M . D . \ " theme on the piano on Google Images ... MUST LEARN TO PLAY !!!!! XD " 
It appears that Facebook is deserted today . 
Crews ' in a couple hours ! PARTY !!! :D 
That party was SO MUCH FUN !!!!! 
I wish YouTube or playlist.com would work on this computer , this song is about to drive me INSANE !!! 
At this rate of procrastination , I'll have one outfit for the beach we're leaving for in two days . Most of what I'm bringing to wear is still in the wash ; the rest was thrown pell-mell into my ( < PROPFEMALE > ) suitcase this morning . 
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is a very gory and disturbing manga series . Why am I reading it ? 
Beach tomorrow , HAIRCUT TODAY !!! :D :D :D :D :D 
at the beach using my sister's laptop . WE HAVE A KITTEN !!!!!!!!! I've named her Andi and she is AFREAKINGDORABLE !!!!!! She <3 ' s me !!! 
Now using Dad's computer , arguing with Mom and < PROPFEMALE > about how to name the rabbit we're getting possibly next week and who named our old one . DAD SAID WE CAN'T KEEP ANDI !!!!! I is sad . 
Home now and missing Andi ( the kitten ) . Our dogs seem so BIG ! 
is craving ice cream with dark chocolate-filled wafer rolls my grandmother brought with her to the beach ( and I ate pretty much all of them ) . 
thinks she pulled a muscle or something in her side , because IT REALLY HURTS . 
Is it sane to have an orthodontist appointment at NINE IN THE MORNING ?! 
I GOT MY BRACES OFF A MONTH EARLY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
nananananananana BATMAAAAAAN !!! 
downloaded iTunes on this computer so I could plug in my iPod to charge while I have the computer speakers plugged into my iPod so I can listen to music . It'd be a lot easier if my iPod would sync to the computer , although then I'd have to keep re-syncing it to my dad's laptop . Problems ... 
just realized that 1 ) if my iPod would sync to this computer and 2 ) if it could play videos , I could put some of MY videos on it !!!!! 
listening to The White Stripes . 
A whole month before House comes back on ... gah . 
is pissed off that PacSun doesn't sell anything but skinny jeans any more . I CAN'T FREAKING WEAR SKINNY JEANS !!!!! 
watching Spirited Away and just got to where Chihiro meets Komachi for the first time ... I absolutely ADORE the sootballs !!! 
Ew . No-Face just ate the little frog guy . 
just finished Spirited Away ( dang ! that movie's two hours long ) and is officially in love with the soundtrack . 
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!! ME AND < PROPFEMALE > HAVE 2 CLASSES TOGETHER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YYYYYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just finished Howl's Moving Castle and I feel sorry for Turnip-Head/Prince ... he's in love with < PROPFEMALE > , who's in love with Howl , who loves < PROPFEMALE > back ... poor Turnip-Head ! 
D . Gray-Man 187 made absolutely NO FREAKIN ' SENSE . And they're still on hiatus until November , and then they're changing to a monthly installment instead of weekly ... whatsoever will I do for the next 2.5 months ?! 
wants < PROPFEMALE > to answer her cellular device so I can talk to her . 
liked orientation , wishes that someone hadn't worn my Rainbows in wet grass and left them all grassy so that the grass was dried on and wouldn't come off and I had to wear uncomfy shoes ( well , ask < PROPFEMALE > , I mostly went around barefoot ) and I HAVE SERIOUS BLISTERS !!!!! 
FROM < PROPFEMALE > JACUMIN : She's a loser and doesn't have internet , and her new computer will have internet soon !!! :D :D :D 
the party last night was fun , < PROPFEMALE > came over and we watched Howl's Moving Castle and got a LOT of new inside jokes from it . 
I started the D . Gray-Man series over again on Friday , didn't read it at all Saturday , and I'm already on chapter 86 . -_- \ " , 2009-08-23 17:58:25 " 
Now on chapter 98 ... Kanda just cannot die , can he ? 
I want < PROPFEMALE > to come back over ... 
I hate my new retainer !!! 
I'm amazed . I just had the first really good first day of school in over 4 years . I'm afraid that < PROPFEMALE > will make tomorrow suck !!! 
had an interesting convo in Dance class today ... Ms. < PROPMALE > is TERRIFIC . 
I a ) had a pretty good day at school . b ) learned that Ms. < PROPMALE > is a true believer in stretching muscles you never knew you had . c ) am leaving for my grandmother's house because she MIGHT have totaled her car , even though Volvos are impregnable ( yes , its silver , for any Twilight freaks out there ) , and Mom's worried about her and Dad is so overprotective that he won't let me stay at home alone for a couple hours . 
I just found out that Andi ( my grandmother's kitten ) slept on my pillow last night . o_0\ " , 2009-08-29 13:03:02 " 
I don't know if I'm excited for tomorrow or not ... 
is trying to figure out how to spell various French words for a dance assignment . 
Boy , do I feel stupid . 
Youth group tonight , possibly ! =] 
will officially have bad dreams tonight . 
Exorcists . Yeah . They do all kinds of crazy crap . They have to , like , hunt the akuma thingies , and , like , take down this fat guy . Yeah , pretty sweet . 
is back from < PROPFEMALE>'s house ! 
You know what really annoys me ? When you have to raise the volume really high on your iPod/MP3 player to hear a certain song , and then it changes and your head gets blasted off . 
I'm on a boat AAAAND it's going fast AAAAND I got a nautical themed pashmina afghaaaan ... 
Birthday countdown : 4 MORE FREAKIN ' DAYS !!!!!!!!! 
dinnertime ! 
listening to random music on < PROPFEMALE>'s iPod ... school tomorrow . Excited for dance , not so much anything else ( besides seeing my friends again and getting my iPod back ) . 
Hmmm , let's see if I can pass this one part in our new game without dying ! Maybe it'll work the seventy-second time . 
We live on front porches and swing life away/We get by just fine here on minimum wage/If love is a labor I'll slave ' til the end/I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand ... 
is now REALLY ticked off !!! I HATE DISNEY DVD DIGITAL COPIES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY SUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
To anyone who wished me a happy birthday : THANK YOU !!!!! I feel so loved :D 
Whoa ! You know what I just realized ? For anyone who watches Bones , you know how Booth and Bones always go to The < PROPMALE > Diner after they finish a case ? THAT SAME DINER IS IN THE \NINE IN THE AFTERNOON\ " VIDEO FOR A FEW SECONDS !!!!!! " 
nananananananananananananananana BATMAAAAN !!! 
You know the one thing you're fighting to hold will be the one thing you've got to let go/And when you feel the war cannot be won we're gonna die to try what can't be done/Gonna say-say I bet you don't care , now is there nothin ' like that inside of you anywhere ? 
had fun on YouTube since < PROPFEMALE > let me use her MacBook ... haha ... DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM !!!!!!! thanks < PROPFEMALE > , you helped make my life . 
< PROPFEMALE > Jacumin's status came from my phone < PROPMALE > . Just to let you guys know ... ( I put this as a comment on her status and she freakin ' DELETED it ! How mean is she ? ) 
feels sick . This sucks . 
' s legs feel like they are about to fall off ... doing the wall stretch for 5 minutes and then doing a whole bunch of crap in P.E. an hour and a half later is NOT very fun . 
< PROPMALE > gained 20 million cool points for not yelling at me for wearing his Green Day shirt , gray/black jacket and this AMAZING hat at his party . For real . 
For real ? < PROPFEMALE > Hathaway is the White < PROPFEMALE > in < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland ? That makes no sense . 
I stabbed myself with the non-pointy end of a needle today in Dance class . How wrong is that ? 
MUST . HAVE . GUITAR . HERO . 5 . Why , you ask ? AAAAAAAA ----- PPPPPUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNKKKKKKKKKK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VVVVAAAAAMMMMMPPPPPIIIIIIIRRRREEEEE WWWWEEEEEEKKKKKKEEEEENNNNNDDDD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's why . 
Vampire Weekend <3 
Today feels like a good day . 
Rehearsal is killing me . PLEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSSEEEEEE let tomorrow go perfectly or Ms. < PROPMALE > will be out for blood . 
TODAY WAS THE FIRST GOOD DAY I'VE HAD IN OVER A WEEK !!!!!!!!! 
My good day is officially ruined . Thanks a LOT , < PROPFIRST > . 
Another performance tonight ... 3 hours of standing in the sound booth doing nothing . It's better than being backstage with the models . 
' Cause this is thrill-ERRRRRR , THRILLER NIGHT !!! :D :D :D 
doesn't know what to do ... 
She got down on hands and knees , one hear against the ground , holding her breath to hear something but the dirt made not a sound tonight ... 
Problem solved ! :D 
definitely needs this 3-day weekend . 
finally watched House and is ready to kill < PROPMALE > and the writers of the show because this must mean that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is leaving the show , just like Kal Penn did . Except I don't think he'll shoot himself in the head . But whatever . 
just rewatched Sweeney < PROPMALE > , orthodontist later . Terrific . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I are so freaking weird . You just have to be part of our inner circle to understand our humor ... actually , most of the time you have to be US . 
I surpass all of you , for I have \The Lost Symbol\ " by < PROPFIRST > Brown . FEAR ME . " 
Ugh . School tomorrow . 
is now , officially , afraid of < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin's toothbrush named < PROPFIRST > . 
Going to youth group tonight , I get to see all my Parkwood Middle friends !!! :D :D :D 
Why can't Facebook just STOP updating to all this random crap ?! 
Was it really necessary for them to play \21 Guns\ " FOUR SEPERATE TIMES during Transformers 2 ? Really ? " 
All the leaves turned red and yellow overnight ... whatever happened to my beautiful in-between season ? 
chatting with < PROPFIRST > , He-Who-Really-Needs-To-Get-A-Facebook . 
Are we , we are , are we we are the waiting ... in a Green Day mood 
No plans for Halloween except to run all around my neighborhood with < PROPFEMALE > screaming out \I'M A POWER RANGER !!! \ " Anyone want to join us ? " 
< PROPFEMALE>'s over :D 
Jeez . My neighborhood sucks at handing out < PROPFEMALE > . At least me and < PROPFEMALE > got to A ) make our hair stand up , kind of B ) go trick-or-treating in our made-in-10-minutes costumes and C ) sit out on the driveway and have fun with glowsticks !!! :D :D :D 
Chapter 188 of D . Gray-Man does NOTHING for the series !!!!! NOTHING !!!!!!!!! HURRY UP AND EXPLAIN WHY KANDA DOESN'T DIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
It's November already ?! 
Okay , so chat's \down for maintenance\ " and notifications aren't getting through ... I'm taking a Tylenol now because I just know this'll give me a headache . "

went to the mall today ! :D 
decided to try and do NaNoWriMo . I doubt I'll get it , but you know what ? I don't care ! :D 
HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP THE P.I. GUY IS BACK ON HOUSE AND HE'S LIVING WITH CUDDY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay , who thinks that < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > are getting a divorce ? And who thinks that this is the last season ? I hope it's not !!! 
It's cold and rainy ... stupid November . 
went to bed last night at 10 & woke up at 11 , I think this is the first time this whole school year I've gotten more than 6-7 hours of sleep ! :D 
Is this the end or just the start of something really , really beautiful/Wrapped up and disguised as something really , really ugly ? 
NCDT tomorrow !!! :D 
New pics , go check them out :D 
to write love on her arms <3

THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW AWESOME HOUSE WAS THIS WEEK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! < PROPFIRST > is leaving < PROPMALE > ALREADY after 6 or 7 weeks of being married at most because he killed that Dibala dictator , and then next week's episode looks AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You know why ? < PROPMALE > PUNCHES HOUSE WITH THE CHEESY SOUND EFFECTS AND EVERYTHING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait until next Monday :D :D :D 
going out of town for Thanksgiving Break ? Poetry Out Loud tomorrow and I still don't know my poem ... crap . 
Daft Punk is AWESOME !!! 
I can almost walk normally now :D One day of crutches , one day of horrible limping , probably one day of slight limping , and then probably one day of almost-back-to-normal-minus-dance-and-gym . 
Work it harder , make it better , do it faster , makes us stronger , more than ever , hour after our work is never over ... DAFT PUNK !!! < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin knows what I'm talking about :D 
Things are shaping up to be pretty odd , little desks and musical beds , so it seems of someone I never met ... 
Ugh . School . 
Angels & Demons still didn't live up to my un-live-uppable standards , but IT WAS AWESOME . :D 
Found an EXCELLENT MLIA to tag < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin in , but it's 200 characters too long for a status update ... STUPID FACEBOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Why do I feel like I'm missing something ? 
is now , officially , a fan of Soul Eater . <3 
can't stop singing \One\ " from \ " A Chorus Line\ " ... jeez . " 
The Christmas Banquet at JAARS was so much fun ! ( Dude in all black with the hot pink tie : you're in for it . You stole my amazing red suitcase . IT'S ON . ) 
back from the mall , picked out some Christmas presents :D 
EXHAUSTED . I don't know how I'm going to survive the week . < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin , can I borrow your iPod for another day ? Pretty stunning gorgeous beautiful please ? I promise I'll give it back someday ! 
kind of sad that the show is over ... everyone at CATA , pay $3 to skip out on 2nd block and see bits & pieces of it on Thursday ( I think) ! 
sooooo tired . Youth group later . Happy and sad that we're not ever doing Homebird or One again ... this is weird ...

listening to Pandora ... how did I ever live without it ? <3 
still working on my video , but now I'm trying to decide which parts to cut -- I spent NO time on YouTube today , all I did was work , and now it's almost done ! :D I just have to cut pieces , add some more , and then put them all in order and hope everything goes where it's supposed to . Oh jeez . 
loves eating mandarin oranges because they make my fingers smell like citrus . Now I can't stop sniffing my fingers . Greaaaaat . 
Dad's fine , his surgery went well according to him & Mom . He's still pretty much half dead from the anesthesia .

had a lot of fun at the mall ! I got a dress , belt & necklace for the b&w semiformal this Saturday , a Dairy < PROPFEMALE > Blizzard , a Rise Against t-shirt , and A TRANSFORMERS BELT BUCKLE !!!!! :D :D :D 
feels accomplished because her MLIA got published . :D 
feels slightly less nauseous/dizzy/woozy after eating some chicken pot pie and apple slices . 
is definitely screwed . How am I supposed to turn in a critique when A ) I'm not going to school tomorrow , and B ) I wouldn't even have that class if I went to school ? 
not in a happy mood . 
??????? watashi wa ninja no yo ? That means \I'm a ninja ! \ " in Japanese . XD Thank you Google Translate ! " 
hasn't eaten dinner yet . 
Ugh . 
Meh . 
Goodnight ... or good morning , if you round up the time and say it's 12 . Depends on what kind of person you are . 
So according to American Eagle Outfitters , my name is Emike Muse . I think something went wrong with our communications , but I'm not changing it . 
So Avatar was the best movie of the century , for SURE . 
oh jeez . Rehearsals start tomorrow . Someone shoot me now and put me out of my misery . 
is so totally screwed . 
soooooooooo sore . Going to bed EARLY . As in , NOW . 
to anyone who says dancing isn't a sport : We have to be flexible , smart , fast , able to remember a whole lot of steps , know what all the stage directions mean , know how to count music and tell when our cues are , and all sorts of other stuff . So SUCK IT . 
going on stage in 3 hours ... ugh ... SO NOT READY !!!!! 
I doubt I'll ever get all this hairspray and body paint off of my body ... and I have to do it all again on Monday ! ' Cause this is THRILLER , thrill-er night ! TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL : THE CATA SHOW HAS BEEN MOVED TO MONDAY ! < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , anyone else who I've told : THE SECOND SHOW IS ON MONDAY , SAME TIME , SAME PLACE , SAME COST . 
it snowed a little bit ! :D 
extraordinarily bored . 
woke up waaaaay too early . Stupid sun . 
Does anyone know if the show is cancelled tomorrow , too ? 
Good morning world , now give me chocolate . 
Dude . House next week looks AWESOME . 
Saw some interesting sights on the bus ride home ... a random guy wearing one of those huge camo jackets holding a rifle and sitting on his porch , some dude who looked JUST LIKE < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and a kitten that was 2 different colors . 
so the show tonight could've been better ( coughSOUNDcough ) but all in all I think it was pretty freaking good . 
soooo I have a ton of homework , plus other stuff I need to do ... ugh . 
someone adopt me , NOW . I'm serious . I can't stand living with these imbecilic jerks who call themselves my \family . \"" 
so the pep rally was only fun because of the surprise ninja fight and the teachers in drag . Other than that , it sucked . ( the freshman class has NOOOOOOO spirit X3 ) 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT THE NEW FACEBOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
so House tonight wasn't the best but it was still pretty good . Not looking forward to tomorrow , just because it's school . 
I heard the birds singing and the crickets chirping today ... I don't have the heart to tell them that they're a couple months early . 
very sick . Ugh . 
watching Survivor , really happy that < PROPMALE > and Sugar and < PROPMALE > are back ( 3 of my favorites !!! ) , and staying home again tomorrow . I'd love to see < PROPFIRST > go home right now and be replaced by < PROPFIRST > Fairplay . 
NUUUUUUU !!!!!!! SUGAR WAS VOTED OFF !!!!!!!!!! dangit . 
still sick , probably not going to school tomorrow ... AGAIN . 
3rd day in a row that I've had a 104/105 fever , leaving for the nearest free clinic as soon as Mom looks them all up . < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin , I blame you for not knocking on wood last night after you said \I hope you don't go to the hospital\ " . XP " 
So I just got back from the clinic . Apparently I have a UTI ... with virtually no symptoms . I feel like I should be on House . XD 
Wow . This is so sad . A Georgian ( the country , not the state ) luger died this morning in practice on the luge course . The entire opening ceremony is now dedicated to him . RIP , young man whose name I do not know . 
might possibly go outside and take pictures of the snow . 
Singles Awareness Day is upon us . Joy . 
baby < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is here to stay X3 
If you're bored , then you can ask me a question or tell me something . http://www.formspring.me/museFTW 
School . Need I say more ? 
oh , how I love old Disney songs ... I've been listening to \Strangers Like Me\ " and \ " I'll Make a Man Out of You\ " for the past hour . I used to sing these all the time ... what happened to those days ? " 
You must be swift as the coursing river , with all the force of a great typhoon , with all the strength of a raging fire , mysterious as the dark side of the moon ... going to watch that movie now X3 
So Miss Saigon is THE BEST THING EVAR . Go watch it . Now . 
working on my choreography , and taking occasional breaks ( like now ) to check Facebook and work on < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin's birthday present :3 
She lives in a fairytale somewhere too far for us to find , forgotten the taste and smell of a world that she's left behind , it's all about the exposure , the lens , I told her the angles were all wrong , now she's ripping wings off of butterflies ... 
According to Mrs. Pentecost , we are in high school because we're not mature enough for college . Hm , that's funny , I'm pretty sure the reason I'm in high school is because I'm not legally old or educated enough to go to college , but I could be wrong . 
I'm so tired I might just go to bed right now . 
has rediscovered the Reduced Shakespeare Company on YouTube ... look it up XD 
FINALLY has her costume for her solo !!! Not exactly what I wanted , but it'll do . 
finally home , going to choreograph the last 18 seconds of my solo then working on science . Fun fun fun ... :P 
dog-sitting this weekend , not doing much else aside from cleaning up my solo and working on a science project . Fun fun fun . :P 
just got back from Wal-Mart , when we got there there were Girl Scouts and Dad said that we'd buy some Thin Mints and Tagalongs on the way out but when we left they were gone . TT^TT 
I want a baby hedgehog that will turn into an adult hedgehog . ( As opposed to , like , a Mudkip or something . ) 
And in the sea there is a fish , a fish that has a secret wish , a wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it ... 
so rehearsal was let out about an hour early because of the snow , and I'm just now getting on Facebook . Oh , have I mentioned enough times how my solo is THE FIFTH DANCE OF THE ENTIRE CONCERT ?!?!?!?!?! TT^TT 
Today , in my microbiology class , I learned that the H1N1 virus is the same strain as the Spanish influenza of 1918 . < PROPFIRST > Cullen had the Spanish influenza and H1N1 just started to surface when he came into the limelight . I blame him , not the pigs . MLIA 
The show is halfway over ! TT^TT And apparently I look like I've been taking hip hop classes for my entire life ... and I've never taken a single one ... 
I slept from 11:30 to 1 PM last night . That's 13 and a half hours . I think I'm ready for the show tonight . 
good morning . 
If you put a box of Thin Mints in the freezer for approximately 5 to 8 minutes , then take them out and eat them , they taste delicious . 
< PROPMALE > from where you are , I lay down on the cold ground and I , I pray that something picks me up and sets me down in your warm arms ... 
In ten minutes , my computer will announce to me that it is 10:00 in a creepy stalker voice at top volume . I love Macs . XD 
[ insert snappy remark here ] 
Okay , so I love the RSC even more now that I'm FINALLY listening to all 170 20-minute-long podcasts I downloaded a while ago . It's not all about about Shakespeare--it's the most random crap that I've ever heard , and for some reason I find it hysterical . 
no comment . 
is fairly pissed off now , and doesn't want to talk about it . that means no comments . 
trying to get my act under control , and failing majorly . Hopefully tonight will make it better . 
I'm watching Pokémon The Movie 2000 : The Power of One and I am legitimately in my happy place . XD 
hates time changes . 
drawing more random stuffs on Tegaki . X3 
has a lot of homework to do ... hopefully I'll finish it soon so I can go on Tegaki and start drawing < PROPFEMALE > nomming on his giant cheeseburger :D 
over halfway done with my science project , about to go research board game rules for < PROPMALE > class ( don't ask ) , and probably not doing my geometry until later tonight or tomorrow morning . I'm proud of myself . XD 
How can I blame you when it's me I can't forgive ? 
Words cannot even begin to describe how simultaneously freaked out , amused , happy , and slightly disappointed I am now that I've read the newest 3 chapters of Soul Eater on OneManga . ( THEY FINALLY GOT THEM UP !!!!!!! Jeez ! ) 
Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > , for letting me have the best day I've had in a looooong time . 
Quick question -- has anyone heard of the Principality of Sealand ? 
\There's no point in staying home on New Year's if I don't have manga and ice cream ! \ " -- Japan is funny sometimes . XD " 
needs to draw . needs to write . needs to edit . needs to charge the camera and get pictures onto my computer . needs to do a project . needs to finish a way-belated birthday present . needs to do all these things , yet wants to do nothing . 
So now I'm positively addicted to < PROPFEMALE>'s character song ( from Hetalia ) , and I don't even know what the translation is . It just sounds like pure awesome . 
is jamming out to 5 of the 8 Hetalia character CDs ! RUSSIA'S SOUNDS FREAKING EPIC . Like , death-metal-orchestra with an innocent-sounding voice . And < PROPFEMALE>'s is still awesome ! And Germany's is kind of weird at first , but you get used to it and it's really good ! And England's has electric guitar ! And France's ... let's not go there ... 
is well overdue for a total mental breakdown ... let's see how long it'll take for it to hit . 
' s brain might just explode if I try to do something now ... but it's either do geometry now with a half-dead brain , or at 2 in the morning with eyelids that won't stay open . 
Leet speak ? WTF ?!?! This is interesting . 
thinks spring might be here to stay . 
SO MUCH TO DOOOOO !!!!! someone save me TT^TT 
Lately I've been getting this intense vibe from my parents that clearly feels like they're deeply disappointed that they're stuck with me as a daughter . Trust me , the feeling's mutual . 
is getting re-obsessed with Rise Against , Vampire Weekend , and a few other bands I ditched upon discovering the Hetalia character songs . 
Micayla Gott , you've converted me -- RHPS is now one of my favorite movies ever . 
hates having to use fan < PROPMALE > for references ... >.< 
and no one even knew it was really only you . 
I really hate the fact that most of the people who use the word \legit\ " don't understand that it's short for \ " legitimate . \"" 
If anyone pulls some stupid prank on me tomorrow , I swear , I'll rip their face off . 
deviantART changed all the icons to something about Lady Gaga . I mean , the icon of EVERY SINGLE USER ON DEVIANTART . Wow . XD 
Accidents are bad . Printing to the right printer is good . 
Oh my god . This is awful ... I can't believe something like this would happen ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ 
feels really awkward after no one understood my last status ... my version of an April Fool's joke that no one seemed to get . 
so I'm looking for a couple of Beatles songs on iTunes , and there's about a thousand versions of both songs . None of the ones I've seen are actually by The Beatles themselves . Oh , the irony ... 
Is it pathetic that the few seconds in Where the Wild Things Are where < PROPMALE > rips up the little paper heart he gave to < PROPFEMALE > , then gently puts it back together , are really heartwrenching and tender ? I just started crying in the middle of dinner because of that . 
Getting started on Gaither's flag project , even though I have ten thousand other things to do . 
So just as Kuroshitsuji gets REALLY freaking interesting , ONEMANGA DOESN'T HAVE THE NEXT CHAPTER . Oh joy , another waiting game . 
Any time you feel the pain , hey < PROPFIRST > , refrain , don't < PROPFEMALE > the world upon your shoulder <3 in a Beatles mood . 
Chocolate truffles are proof that God loves us . 
doing some SERIOUS room-cleaning . If no one hears from me after this , then it's quite likely that I was either eaten by some mutant creature living under my bed , or I died of exhaustion and dust inhalation . 
I swear , if those stupid people don't stop shining that effing green laser into my bedroom window I will personally march across the empty lot and skin the lot of them . 
Oh my god , I think my feet might fall off . TT^TT 
show me how to lie , you're getting better all the time , and turning all against the one is an < PROPMALE > that's hard to teach . 
Why does no one in my family tell me anything anymore ? 
Spring break is over already ? Jeez . That was too fast . 
eh . 
Yesterday , my best friend slept over with me . The next morning she showed me a video of me mumbling ' The cake is a lie . The lie is a pie . The pie is a spy . The spy is < PROPMALE > Nye . ' I'm not sure if I even want to know what I was dreaming about . MLIA 
Day of Silence tomorrow , haircut in a bit :D 
I do believe that my hair is about ten pounds lighter . :D 
I'm actually looking forward to the Diversity Concert tomorrow . Just not the whole being-there-at-11-to-perform-at- 3:30 thing . 
home from the Diversity Concert , saw < PROPFEMALE > Willemin there :D 
The science project is going pretty well , so I'm thinking I might NOT have to stay up until 5 in the morning to finish it . Maybe just 4 . 
I have about 5 bruises scattered across my knees , one on my right ankle , one on the back of my head , and then one on my back . I have no idea where they came from . This worries me slightly . 
I finally succeeded in blowing all the seeds off of a dandelion in one go . Too bad I didn't wish for anything beforehand . 
is now the proud owner of a cactus named < PROPMALE > . FEAR ME . 
So according to < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin , my new name is officially \Emijley ( EM-i-juh-lee ) . \ " Okay then . " 
Went shopping with the padre . It took us 30 seconds to find a solid shirt , a minute to find some black and tan hotshorts , and all of of 2 hours to find a sundress that works with what Mr. Drye wants . At least I've got all my costume stuff . 
My cactus is growing . This excites me far more than it should , probably because this means I've owned a plant for more than 2 days without killing it . 
Earth Science was rather hilarious over in the corner with Homar Ramirez and < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin . Let's hope Ms. Kopchick is out for the next two days , too . 
definitely NOT looking forward to the Poetry Slam today ... TT^TT 
How am I supposed to pretend I never want to see you again ? -Vampire Weekend = <3 - 
New episodes of Hetalia make me happy . :D 
is now the proud owner of a Silly Bandz giraffe named < PROPFIRST > , thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > :D 
Is it normal for my cactus to grow 3 inches in a week ? 
I've got a feeling , if I sang this loud enough , you would sing it back to me ... 
And in the free fall , I will realize that I'm better off when I hit the bottom . 
not very enthused about Mr. Drye leaving ... 
so it's finally hit me that Mr. Drye's pretty much gone . 
is too exhausted to think of anything else to say but , \I'm exhausted . \"" 
Home early :D 
just got out of the best shower of my life . Only one more show ... what a depressing thought . 
I'm going to cry after the show tonight . I just know it . 
I would just like to extend my deepest thanks and eternal gratitude towards the utter genius who invented makeup remover . 
And if you come around again , then I will take the chain from off the door ... 
Cette mélodie hante mon cerveau , cette mélodie qui a été une fois de nous ... 
Dentist . Ick . 
I swear , keeping this food journal will make me go anorexic before the end of the week . 
so tomato sandwiches are officially my favorite food . 
What am I doing ? 
I seriously need to get this under control . 
Someone needs to find a cure for allergies , because I can't take this any more . DIE , ALLERGIES , DIE . 
I woke up unable to breathe through my nose , then had a panic attack about it , then realized that no I was NOT dying , I was just congested . And this is why I hate spring and summer . 
Being left to my own devices = staring at my computer as if it'll magically create something interesting for me to look at . I'm lazy today . 
no nighttime allergy meds + heavy rain = sleepless night . Oh , tomorrow will be lovely . 
Leave me out with the waste , this is not what I do ... 
so the new Hetalia episode brightened my day up a considerable amount . :D 
I'm just trying to do my best ; I'm not afraid of life , I'm afraid of death ... ( VOXTROT IS AMAZING . Just saying . ) 
just rediscovered the first-grade joy of apples and peanut butter . :D 
So when I sit downstairs and watch my sister play GameCube , I get my homework done faster than if I sit in my room with fewer distractions . Does this strike anyone else as odd ? 
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IS EVERYTHING CHANGING AAAAHHHHH !!!!!!!! First Facebook , then Google , then Wikipedia , now deviantART ! I DON'T LIKE THIS !!!!!!! 
Casino Royale . :D 
\There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets . This is the latter . \"" 
she got down on hands and knees , one ear against the ground , holding her breath to hear something , anything at all ... getting back into Rise Against while I wait for < PROPFEMALE>'s friends to leave so I can eat something . 
has the feeling that there's something that's been forgotten . Probably homework . 
All of these über-long fan < PROPFEMALE > names are stretching out my Facebook home < PROPFEMALE > . It's getting really , REALLY annoying . 
So \Repo ! The Genetic Opera\ " is officially one of my new favorite movies . I'm sure < PROPFEMALE > Dance and Homar Ramirez are happy about that . XD " 
I'm infected by your genetics ... <3 Repo ! :D 
Some things you don't forgive , some things you don't forget , sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death . 
I am lost without you here ; I am only living out a lie ... 
Que votre vie soit < PROPFEMALE > rêve , l'intégrité , l'honnêteté , il est trop tard pour moi , ne regardez pas en arrière jusqu'à ce que vous êtes libres de chasser < PROPFEMALE > matin ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Jacumin < PROPFEMALE > Dance Homar Ramirez NEW YGOTAS EPISODE :D :D :D :D :D 
is now incredibly happy . :D 
Lesson of the day : Always check to make sure that the headphones you're using for an < PROPMALE > project do NOT work better than the ones you're using now , BEFORE you hot-glue them to the cardboard . >.< Will Mrs. Pentecost give me extra points for my sculpture doubling as a speaker ? 
I just had the time of my life on Ustream with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > from Parlé Productions . < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin , YOU MISSED SOOOOO MUCH . 
OH MY GOD FUNIMATION IS DUBBING HETALIA . I don't know whether or not this is good , but if Vic Micwhatever dubs < PROPFEMALE > I WILL KILL SOMEONE . 
Noms , then searching through the attic for fabric , then doing science homework . Funfunfun . 
is most definitely not doing homework right now , and most definitely needs to be . 
Headed for < PROPFEMALE>'s in a bit ! :D 
nomming on these heavenly oatmeal raisin cookies I made with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > this morning , and I think they're going to be gone within the next 10 seconds . Oh well . 
WHY HAS FUNIMATION RATED HETALIA AS TV-MA ?!?!?! 
does NOT approve of FUNimation's Hetalia subs . I'm sorry , but they suck . 
so my mosquito bites are REALLY killing me . Funfunfun . 
I want to cover my bedroom walls in whiteboards , mirrors , and clocks . 
I defeated the Akinator by thinking of a tomato . Wow . 
Imogen Heap is my new musical love . 
Is anyone else having issues finding info about Sonni < PROPMALE > for their lineage paper , or is it just me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Jacumin and I seem to have a never-ending argument about whether or not Pokémon would be delicious if eaten . I say no and that it's cruel to eat them , she thinks they'd be tasty . Discuss . 
actually got a couple of awards tonight :) I didn't think I would ! 
I am officially the stupidest person on the face of the planet . You cannot fathom the depths of my lack of intelligence . 
Fifteen minutes ago it was < PROPFEMALE > . What the heck . 
I feel like I've left so much undone and half-finished . 
Well , Facebook , there's quite a bit on my mind right now and it won't all fit into this little box . Thanks for asking , though . 
I will never see < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE>'s head the same way again . 
just read a summary of the Hetalia movie . Does anyone know how to raise enough money to buy a plane ticket to Japan and a few movie tickets within , say , 3 days ? 
missed a Ustream with the Parle Crew ... DX 
I've been playing \Viva la Vida\ " on repeat for the past hour . This cannot be healthy . " 
Dear Weather , I have a very important test tomorrow , and I need sleep beforehand . This thunderstorm is NOT helpful to my cause . SO SHUT UP AND STOP STORMING ALREADY . Thanks . 
One more exam , then I'm done for freshman year . It's all gone by so fast . 
Next time you point a finger , I'll point you to the mirror . 
It's official : I survived my first year of high school . Only 3 left ... 
She got down on hands and knees , one ear against the ground , holding her breath to hear something , but the dirt made not a sound tonight . 
Blackbird singing in the dead of night , take these broken wings and learn to fly ; all your life , you were only waiting for this moment to arise ... 
3 days in and I already hate summer . 
If a size 2 is a plus-sized model , then I'd hate to think of what kind of model I'd be . < PROPFEMALE>'s Next Top Model is NOT good for my mentality . 
Forget ANTM , I'm watching soccer . Estados Unidos FTW !!!!!! 
I would just like to say , PEOPLE NEED TO QUIT QUOTING \AIRPLANES\ " BY B.O.B. IT'S GETTING SERIOUSLY OLD . Thank you . " 
is quite happy right now , so please , < PROPFEMALE > , if you're listening , don't ruin it ! 
Sorry , Mom , but if my first time behind the wheel was at 10 at night I don't think I'd be doing too spectacularly . ( She tried to get me to drive , I didn't want to , and we spent 5 minutes arguing/laughing about it ... disaster safely averted . ) 
I feel like I have a thousand things to do today . 
DUDE . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > IS OLD . SERIOUSLY . I mean , I knew he wasn't exactly young , but I mean , he looks REALLY OLD in this commercial . 
Open your eyes like I opened mine ; it's only the real world . 
is seriously getting sick of all these unwanted news feed posts . I've probably hidden a quarter of my friends from my feed already . 
can't stop listening to < PROPFEMALE>'s Eurovision 2010 song , and WHY MUST I READ \3 CUPS OF TEA\ " ???? And why does this year's World History summer reading sound so much cooler than what I had to read ? This is unfair . " 
I think the person/people who made the Powerthirst video were high at the time . There's no other way that could have come into existence . 
playing < PROPFIRST > with the sister ! 
So do we advance in the World Cup or what ? 
Sometimes , I regret following the cast of \House\ " on Twitter . " 
New very spiffy phone , AND they synced my contacts from my old phone . This couldn't get better . :D 
I just found out that I have Ms. Pac-Man , Tetris , and The Oregon Trail on my phone . THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME . 
I'm going to try and get decent-quality sleep for the first time this week . Goodnight Facebook . 
wound up not getting any sleep at all last night . < PROPFEMALE > hates me . 
is currently addicted to < PROPFEMALE>'s Eurovision 2010 song . 
So my house is no longer in the middle of nowhere--we're on Google Maps satellite view now ! XD 
< PROPFEMALE > Willemin : So apparently there's a small scene in the Hetalia movie where Russia does a little bit of ballet . I MUST SEE THIS . 
For some unknown reason , my computer refuses to connect to the Internet . Oh joy . 
Okay , the Internet's all good now :D 
To everyone who just got an invitation from me to look at that most awkward moment for a teen thing : It sent them out automatically . Sorry about that . 
The world suddenly feels a lot smaller and lonelier . 
< PROPFEMALE > Michaelson is my new musical love . 
Home , back to listening to < PROPFEMALE > Michaelson nonstop . :P 
The vuvuzela thing on the YouTube videos is HILARIOUS . 
I AM ECSTATIC . :D :D :D 
We'd better win this . I want a rematch against England . 
Fanfreakingtastic . Why are all of my teams losing ? 
I swear , I'm becoming nocturnal . 
This is just not fair . TOTALLY not fair . Completely and utterly UNFAIR . 
planning my entry for the Hetalia postcard contest . I probably won't win , but whatever ! 
You never realize just how easily scared you get at 12:30 until you have a mini centipede somehow get onto your head then fall onto your arm , without you knowing , and then you look to scratch and there's this black wriggly thing on your elbow and you have no idea where it came from . 
I'm SO going to go see < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt . 1 in IMAX 3D when it comes out . 
< PROPFIRST > Olberman is both interesting and hilarious . 
Happy Canada Day , everyone ! :) 
CORRECTION : happy Canada Day AND happy < PROPFIRST > Kong independence day ! ( I don't really know what to call it ... so independence day works . ) 
Got in the car and turned on the radio JUST as \Audience of One\ " came on . My day was successfully made . :) " 
I need a haircut . Badly . 
bought Ponyo at Target and I am now watching it . Don't bother me . :D 
Ponyo is the CUTEST MOVIE EVER . :D :D :D 
happy Independence Day , everyone ! :) 
now trying to decide which Parlé shirt to ask for for my birthday ... decisions , decisions ... I want all of them ! DX 
Now all I have to do is figure out how to upload these videos of fireworks onto Facebook ... 
At < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s house , her < PROPFEMALE > is made of cuteness :D 
< PROPMALE > and I defy the rules : we're going outside today . We're such rebels . XD 
I REALLY want to go on the Intimidator right now . Or some sort of roller coaster . I need a thrill . 
watching < PROPMALE > Dunham Spark of Insanity and eating ice cream . Life is good . 
This used to be a funhouse , but now it's full of evil clowns ... \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , I blame you for getting this song stuck in my head . D:< 
I'm actually up before noon . This is a first . 
Next time you point a finger , I might have to bend it back or break it , break it off ... 
SPAAAAAAIIIIINNN !!!!!!! 
I'm copying < PROPFIRST > , because I'm bored too . \ 
I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ... You can ask me 1 question ( only in my INBOX ) Any me 1 question ( only in my INBOX ) Any question , no matter how crazy it is . You have my FULL honesty , but I DARE you to put this text on your status and see what questions you get . 
Driver'd < PROPMALE > today . This is going to be interesting ... 
If the yellow light is blinking , what does it mean ? \ 
A . Slow down . \ 
B . It's too timid to stay on . \ 
C . Time for a steroid test ! \ 
D . It's definitely broken . \ 
Fun with < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin and Mcky Sorgen in Driver's < PROPMALE > ! 
just got \Sinnerman Remix\ " flashbacks after hearing the song on a phone commercial . Good times ... except for my leotard ... " 
I AM SICK AND FREAKING TIRED OF ALL THESE THUNDERSTORMS !!!!!!! 
now I want to go see the Green Day musical ... it sounds amazing . 
Happy birthday , < PROPFEMALE > ! :) 
Did someone break your heart inside ? You're in ruins ... 
Drunk goggles are fun , and Subway is delicious , and I'm at < PROPFEMALE > Willemin's house for the next two nights and three days :D 
\No 
So I've lived here for exactly 3 years today . Fun . 
hates her schedule . 
I want to go on a spontaneous cross-country road trip someday . 
http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf\ 
EPIC WIN . 
Look for the bare necessities , the simple bare necessities , forget about your worries and your strife ... ( I really want to watch this movie now ! DX ) 
ASDFGHJKL ; I JUST FOUND RHPS ON NETFLIX . MY DAY HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN MADE . :D 
Aaaaand of course the oil is spilling again . Funfunfun . 
home from driver's < PROPMALE > , watching House and working on my PowerPoint . Thank goodness the teacher said we could have slides of just pictures . XD 
So guess whose glasses just spontaneously fell apart ? 
... 
so I really hate the fact that OneManga is being taken down and I can't read D . Gray-Man any more . RIGHT after they got to the most epic cliffhanger ever . 
done with driver's < PROPMALE > :D 
colorsplashing some of these dance pictures . Our \Homebird\ " costumes look almost yellow-ish onstage ... I can't tell what's costume and what's skin XD " 
I have a feeling this live-action Fairly Oddparents movie is going to ruin my childhood . 
trying to get used to the APH English dub ... it's not working XD

I actually own a pair of sunglasses now . This is , like , my fourth pair ever . XD 
the one horrible thing about this hacked Internet connection is that it screws up my AIM . DX 
Walked around < PROPFEMALE > Beach ( I think ) today , about to get back on the ferry . There are TONS of seagulls around our car and one of them keeps staring at me ... 
the fact that I forgot my camera-to-computer cord at home is going to kill me . MUST . GET . PICTURES . ON . MY . LAPTOP . NOWWWWWW . D:< 
hi . 
had to go in early because of some first-class a-holes smoking cigarettes on the beach . the smoke was blowing RIGHT IN MY FACE . um , no thanks . B|

So the winners of the Hetalia fancard competition have been announced . Too bad I forgot to submit one . 
So I'm about 99% certain that my cactus is dead or dying . Fanfreakingtastic .

Homar Rmirez is baaaaack , and with fancy new glasses ! 8D 
great . now I've got The Midnight Beast's \Booty Call\ " stuck in my head . -_-" 
They turned Twilight into a graphic novel . I believe this is the point where society facepalms and wonder what went wrong with today's youth . 
totally isn't procrastinating my homework , nope , no sir . 
trolling on Omegle is both entertaining and a fun way to procrastinate . 
just found out < PROPFIRST > O'Brien plays Phineas & Ferb's dad . Can we get a close up , Riff ? 
Hangin ' out down the street ... \ 
( finish the lyrics , people . ) 
honest to God , I will break your heart , tear you to pieces and rip you apart . 
guess who forgot to pick up her dance textbook along with her English book at the parent meeting tonight ? -_- Google Images it is ... 
homework , Chip , and then whatever . I'm being a good little girl tonight and not leaving my homework for midnight or later . XD 
so there's about a 0.001% < PROPMALE > of me going to youth group tonight ... TOO MUCH FREAKING HOMEWORK . 
I feel like going somewhere . 
so all I have left to do on the homework front is finish 1776 and answer a few more study questions ... meh . 
so I found the glue to repair my glasses , but I can't get it open ... fanfreakingtastic . 
I keep getting really epic people at ChaCha to answer my questions . This makes my day . 
DUDE . I just updated iTunes because my computer told me to ... \ 
IT'S FREAKING FANCY . 
now let's try to rip myself off of the computer and go type up my dance paper ... and write my English essay ... and study for my Spanish test ... and did I mention study my dance vocab ? -_- \ " , 201 0-0 9-08 20:43:07 "

Thanks for all the birthday wishes , everyone ! :D 
I really want to see \American Idiot\ " now that I'm researching it ... " 
bedtime . plus it's no longer my birthday , so what's the point in staying up any more ? 
the truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you . 
one light , one mind , flashing in the dark , blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts . 
this is going to be a bad week . 
let's get down to business to defeat this three-page paper . 
so I'm only halfway done with my paper , but I'm already starting < PROPFEMALE > 3 ... I have a feeling that this is going to be about 10 < PROPFEMALE > s long . -_- 
finished my dance paper and powerpoint ! and the paper is only 3.5 pages , not the ten million I was expecting ! yay ! :D 
has too much homework . 
pretty sure I did my dance warm-up entirely wrong , but whatever . 
I remember the face but I can't recall the name ; now I wonder how Whatsername has been . 
not happy . 
\Hairspray\ " auditions were crazy . " 
she is one of a kind , well , she's the last of the American girls . 
I bought one song on iTunes and my account credit went from $11.99 to $10.93 . That is NOT a $0.99 difference . B| 
International Talk Like A Pirate Day . \ 
DO IT . 
why does my mother insist on ruining my entire week ? 
I got a double callback for Hairspray -- one for singing , one for dance . How did that happen ?! 
I hate this . 
today wasn't so bad . 
screw this body paragraph , I'm going to bed . 
so none of my clothes fit me right anymore . greeeeeeaaaaaat . now I feel fat in everything . 
I didn't kill anyone today ! 8D 
I kept telling my brain to turn off at 10 , but it's just now getting the message . oh well .

so effing pissed off right now I can't even think . oh my god , this cannot be happening to me . I can't believe this . I thought he was better than that . apparently he's not . 
Oh my god , if I don't get a shower soon I will die . 
I really don't want to < PROPFEMALE > around school for another 2+ hours . 
I'm your biggest fan , I'll follow you until you love me . \ 
\

I hate footnotes . 
heads-up to anyone who has Mrs. Tatarek this semester : she has a family emergency & she's going to be out for the next 2+ days . joy . 
I think I know what I want to do for my duet . 
working things out . 
procrastination . 
falling in love with < PROPFEMALE > Michaelson all over again . 
and all the best lies are told with fingers tied , so cross ' em tight . 
all the best lies are told with fingers tied , so cross ' em tight . 
really wants to do this Boot Camp thingy for my laptop and get Windows on it . seems like a handy thing to have . 
this bus driver is EVIL . I don't know how I'll stand a whole school year with her ... 
indulging in my fascination with WWII , thanks to Mrs. Tatarek and the book she let me borrow . :D 
can't read my , can't read my , no , he can't read my poker face . 
talked to near-strangers and received enlightenment . I'm not going into this blind . 
why do I feel like I'm about to cry ? 
can't stop listening to Green Day now , thanks to the party last night ... ¬.¬

Our bus isnt even ON the lot yet . This is irksome . 
she's a natural disaster , she's the last of the American girls . 
< PROPFEMALE > Ciel Owens , I WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR GEORGES , NOR AM I YOUR NEPHEW . SO SUCK IT . 
so whatcha say we give it up & walk away ? nothing to salvage anyway . 
so I feel like everyone got callbacks except for me . 
WHY IS MY COMPUTER NOT CONNECTING TO THE FREAKING INTERNET . 
tell me when you hear my heart stop , you're the only one that knows ; tell me when you hear my silence , there's a possibility I wouldn't know . 
this is way too confusing for my tastes . 
intermission . I've been acting as a backstage attendant since \Power . \"" 
well , that was ... interesting . 
SOMEONE NEEDS TO BRING VUVUZELAS TO CATA'S HOMECOMING GAME TONIGHT . \ 
I'M JUST SAYING . \

< PROPFIRST > Downey , Jr. sounds so much better with an English accent . just saying . 
listening to The Fratellis . their music = love . 
that concert was SO much better than Thursday's . 
so let me know , ' cause I can stay or , < PROPFEMALE > , I can go . 
Please put this as your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is neither a disease nor a choice -- people who are gay are not looking for a cure , but for acceptance and equal rights . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least 1 hour ? 
let's see how angry my parents will be about the fact that I wasn't nominated for Governor's School . 
well , she's Colombia's finest , oh , she's better than good . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity . Stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity and sympathy does not help . We can raise awareness . 97% of people wont copy and paste this , because they dont know how to copy and paste . 
hey < PROPFEMALE > Willemin , what lunch do you have ? XD

happy Hallow's < PROPFEMALE > ! 
for some unknown reason , my voice is dying , even though I didn't scream last night ... oh jeez . 
and it took me too long ' til I found out faces you know the best ; oh well , I guess . 
does the font of the news feed seem smaller to anyone else ? 
I'm really horrible at getting homework done quickly . 
this heart will start a riot in me . 
why is it so cold in my house ?! D: 
rawr . :3 
Avatar on HBO . :3 
this time change isn't going to cooperate with my sleep schedule .

and you'll sleep ' til May , and you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore . 
I seriously cannot stop listening to this song . 
< PROPMALE > Potter movie marathon . life is great . 
I'm finding waaaaaaaay too much anime merchandise I need to buy . 
the fact that our digital copy of < PROPMALE > Potter & the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > ( that we didn't know about until 10 seconds ago ) expired really irks me . B ( 
like my status & I'll do nothing about it . :3 
these are the lives you'd love to lead . 
I like chocolate and buttered bread far too much for my health . 
the hardest part is letting go of your dreams . 
Braeburn apples = <3 . :3 
I just totally skipped the Forsaken Fortress . I'm just that good . 
I can see it from the other side ; the grass is in no way as green . 
since Lem Styles changed her name back , I figured I would too . :P 
anybody wanna ask me something in my inbox ? I shall answer it as a status . ( yes , for once , I'm doing one of these stupid things ... I have the feeling that I'll regret it . ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Ciel Owens : because I keep forgetting that we've moved to Skype , and because you're evil . < PROPFEMALE > Jacumin : are you sure you're not talking about yourself ? 
eye doctor tomorrow ... hopefully I'll at least get these glasses fixed . 
now I know how to get off these dirt roads to find these streets of gold . 
that eye doctor was ... interesting . I got a trial pair of contacts ... that I won't use a lot ... and my glasses still aren't fixed ... but hopefully , I'll be getting new ones relatively soon . 
I greatly dislike thunderstorms , especially because my bed is about 3 feet away from my window . 
Put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was killed at Hogwarts when it was under siege by the Death Eaters during The Second Wizarding War . Over 50 citizens died in the terrorist attack against Hogwarts . 93% of people won't repost this , but will you be part of that magical 7% that will ? Repost to show your support of Dumbledore's Army ! 
\I don't want my life to be like Spiderman 3 ! I hate that movie ! \""

so < PROPMALE > & I spent about half of that movie sobbing on each others ' shoulders . GO SEE IT NOW . 
Pandora internet radio + Indie Singer/Songwriter channel = a very happy ( but still ill-feeling ) < PROPFEMALE > . :3 
feels utterly horrible .

these urban legends about Pokémon game hacks are gonna give me nightmares . 
guess who's got a kitten named Maxwell ? \ 
THE MUSES DO :D 
< PROPFEMALE > went to the vet today ... he is not a happy < PROPFEMALE > . 
just went on an unliking spree . 958 to 563 pages in 20 minutes . heck yeah . 
I am certain I was not that rude or ignorant in eighth grade . absolutely positive . 
but I'll only ever be a middle-distance runner . 
don't look up , just let them think there's no place else you'd rather be . 
baby loves to dance in the dark ' cause when he's looking , she falls apart .

ugh . 
my plan for the downtime during the show : choreograph my duet . it's a flawless plan .

I do not approve of this new Facebook . and the show last night was pretty great ; if you want to attend tonight , it's 7 P.M. in the CATA theater . tickets are $8 . hope to see you there ! 
I love the smells of makeup and hairspray . 
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor . 
it's just one of those days . 
we're plastic , but we still have fun . 
and the last-chance girl in a first-dance world lays her head down on the wooden floor , won't be dancing any more . 
I don't think Mrs. < PROPFIRST > knows that asking me to describe a movie in paragraph form will take me about 10 pages due to my irrational need to include every little detail down to the color of their lipstick . 
I'm perpetually cold nowadays . 
whatever you do , don't be afraid of the dark . 
everyone who likes \Soul Eater\ " ( i.e. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Veenstra & < PROPFEMALE > Umbras ): the first episode is currently free on iTunes for a very limited time . turns out FUNi ISN'T totally evil . :D " 
all we are are pretty faces , picture-perfect bottled rage . 
happy 13-year-and-one-day anniversary of the infamous Porygon \Pokémon\ " episode ! " 
I've spent all day downstairs playing videogames in my PJs . this is the one good thing about winter break . 
plus when the full < PROPFEMALE > starts to rise , we'll all sing out , \it's Christmastime ! \ " \ 
the vet said these painkillers would make < PROPMALE > lethargic ... if anything , he's more hyper than usual . ¬.¬ 
watching the A&E adaption of \Pride & Prejudice . \ " this movie has grown on me over the past 6 years . " 
the < PROPFEMALE > of Time is definitely the easiest dungeon ever .

because I'll only ever be a middle-distance runner . 
so basically , if I want to be a dance/movement therapist , I have a choice of 6 schools , none of which are in NC . oh well . 
just spent an entire iTunes giftcard on HTTYD . it was well worth it , though . :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Jacumin , you are so lucky I love you . B ( 
I've been listening to Lady Gaga a lot recently . feel free to psychoanalyze me . \

you just can't take the effect and make it the cause . 
finally figured out how to get files onto my phone ! :D 
and I can't seem to shake this awful feeling . 
long since dried , when we are found , are the tears in which we had drowned . 
test-writing is always fun . ¬.¬ 
kinda wish that I'd gone out for MADE , but having cameras follow me everywhere and document my life would make me go absolutely off-the-wall crazy . 
there's nothing else I can say . 
quit blaming me for the side effects of your desires . 
and who knows why the love you need will always pass you by ? 
my sister just turned on \Super < PROPFIRST > Galaxy 2\ " and < PROPFIRST>'s voice sounds JUST LIKE < PROPMALE > HABERKORN AS ITALY . this is wrong on so many levels . " 
I hate football . 
after taking into account the fact that it took me 15 minutes to locate my phone , all I can say is : I am certainly not a Hufflepuff .

you're waiting for a train that will take you far away . you know where you hope this train will take you , but you can't be sure ... yet it doesn't matter . now , tell me why ? 
not really excited for this HTTYD sequel . can't Disney just let an amazing movie be amazing without squeezing as much cash out of it as possible ? 
all this snow has lost its novelty . 
Ponyo , Ponyo , Ponyo , fishy in the sea , < PROPFEMALE > little fishy , who could you really be ? :3
