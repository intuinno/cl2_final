I had a great week . < PROPFEMALE > was the best counselor ever ! I miss it . 
I love finding songs you haven't listened to in what feels so long !!! And it always takes you right back to the very moment of whatever you were either thinking , doing , scents and everything ! I find it so fascinating .. 
hahaha . I'm so glad I finally watched that movie :) 
Music makes me loose control . Let's go ! 
is sooo thirsty . 
I have noticed that I pretty much want garlic , all the time . It's officially one of my favorite herbs ! I put it on almost everything . 
Just changed my myspace , pretty much everything on it ! 
EATING CHEEZ-ITS 
God is good all the time ! 
Majorly sunburned on my back from using a body board in the pond today .. swam for like three hours !!! Lotsa fun though :) I love < PROPFEMALE>'s room . Also had a noodle fight with Casey .. haha

My birthday is next Saturday ! 
Yesterday was < PROPFEMALE > fun ! :D 
There's no time for fear . Visions kinda happen . No matter how this ends today , I wanna leave here as friends . It's not that I don't love you . Don't think that I don't care . We were trying to fly a plane , the wings were just not there . 
SUBWAY COOKIES ARE THE BEST . MHMM . 
Tillimook Mint Chip ice cream with whipped cream on top is delicious ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s dad : \Are you blond ? \ " Me : \ " I just got my hair cut :) \ " .. Lots of laughter .. < PROPFIRST > : \ " Yea you're totally blond\ " . What I thought he asked was ' Is your hair long ? ' ... Ooops ! " 
So what are you waiting for What do you have to lose Your insecurities They try to hold to you But you know you're made for more So don't be afraid to move Your faith is all it takes And you can walk on the water too 
had a fun filled day (: 
< PROPFIRST>'s passed out . What am I doing awake !? 
Just like a hurricane , You devastate everything that needs to change . 
No glass ever became sand again ; No bread ever became wheat ; No ripened fruit ever became a flower . Welcome change , and choose what kind of glass you create , what kind of bread you bake , what kind of fruit you harvest . 
I smell like cookies . I can't wait to pass them out tomorrow . Tonight was a blast ! :) 
Can you see me ? Here I am . I need you like I needed you then . When I feel like giving up , I climb inside your heart and still find ... you're my safest place to hide . 
In a way , I know my heart is waking up . As all the walls come tumbling down , I'm closer than I've ever felt before . And I know , and you know , .... there's no need for words right now . 
In Better Hands - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Now and forever , I know who owns my heart . 
Just discovered Picnik , and I'm goin ' craazy with it ! 
loved the roses and chocolate I got today ... I think I know who it was from ... :) Thanks so much !! Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day everyone ?

It's time to decide Which is out of my mind Cause it'll be me unless I put some thoughts to rest and leave some faults behind I'll watch the glint in my eye Shine off the spring in my step And could be blinding depending on the amount of You that I reflect 
ads on youtube videos , ARE . SO . ANNOYING . 
The trouble with truth is it never lies And the trouble with wrong’s That it’s never right So I rest my head under Your light The trouble with peace , is it never fights And the trouble with love’s That it’s always blind 
I hate having a dry cough because you KNOW that means you're gonna get a really sick nasty deep chest cough eventually .. ugh and they last forever too ! 
Two more days of testing .. writing and ya can't forget MATH .. yuck . =\\ 
\And I can't explain . Last night I saw the fireworks . The kind of pain that never hurts . The one you hate to love is made for you . Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon . \"" 
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa .. (: 
How could success make us feel like failures ? And the harder we fall the harder we try The more I have the more I need Just to feel like I’m getting by Oh , there’s so many questions and one short life And I wonder why Sometimes the truth ain’t easy to find I wanna know all the answers But I’m learning that These things take time 
I should have gone ! 
You give me the kind of feeling , people write novels about ... :) 
I'm ready I'm ready IIIIIIIIII'm ready :)

While in the SeaTac airport , waiting for my flight , The lead singer of All American Rejects walks by and as I look at him he looks at me and I have this moment where I realize who he is and all the while I keep staring so intently at him so I think he knew I knew who he was . I just couldn't believe he was walking so casually in public . Then I saw the other guitarist pass ; 6 celebs in the past 2 days . AWESOME ! 
But you're still here , your feet stuck to the ground . Despite how silly it sounds .. you're bigger than me . :)

Really misses Myranda < PROPFEMALE > 
Letters to < PROPFEMALE > was really cute , that old woman is so sweet ! It almost made me cry . 
Fill me up . Steam me up . Hear me shout . Tip me over and pour me out . 
You know that feeling in your heart ? When your heart is just pounding , like it's actually outside your ribs . Exposed , vulnerable , but wonderful and awful , and heartsick , and alive , all at the same time ? 
Maybe you can afford wait . Maybe for you there's a tomorrow . Maybe for you there's one thousand tomorrow's , or three thousand , or ten , so much time you can bathe in it , roll round in it , let it slide like coins through your fingers . So much time you can waste it . \ 
But for some of us there's only today . And truth is , you never really know . 
This is my desire : To be used by You . 
Sooooooooo , \ 
I think Angel might have broken the sliding door at < PROPFIRST>'s last night ... xD 
Made chocolate chip cookies ! 
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't . So if the chain is on your door , I understand . 
The Invisible <3 Still my favorite movie . 
Like my status and i'll tell you : 1 . something i've learned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . the color you remind me of . 3.my favorite memory with you . 4 . the animal you remind me of . 5 . ask somethingi've always wondered about you . 6.my favorite thing about you . 7 . give you a nickname . 8 . challenge you to repost this 
My thoughts will < PROPFEMALE > your name until I see you again . 
The playful conversation starts .. Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy . And it was enchanting to meet you , All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you :) .. 
Me : And when I HIT things ... THAT'S when you know what you said just hit the funny bone in my body better than ever . Myranda says ( 3:05 AM ): * HAHAHAHAH*the funny bone in your body ?! *hahahhaha*oh man 
And over all these virtues put on love , which binds them all together in perfect unity . - Colossians 3:14

Talking to yourself - that's actually more like listening than speaking . 
The most beautiful people are those who have known defeat , known suffering , known struggle , known loss and have found their way out of the depths . They have an appreciation , a sensitivity , and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion , gentleness , and a deep loving concern . Beautiful people do not just happen . 
Some times you'll never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory .
