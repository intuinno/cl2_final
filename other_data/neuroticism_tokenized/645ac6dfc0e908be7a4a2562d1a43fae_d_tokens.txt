HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE ! 

He left for Japan this morning . And my heart feels like it's breaking . Three long years without him . 
He's in Japan . At least he's ok . 
I'm so tired ! I really need to sleep better . 
I want to go to Japan . I need to get a job and save up money . I found a flight+hotel for $ 1,935 . I really want to go ! 
< PROPMALE > called me last Friday . That made me really happy . 
< PROPMALE > makes me really happy even though is in Japan right now . Just hearing his voice puts a smile on my face . 
It get easier and easier as the days go on , but it's still hard having him all the way in Japan with me here in Ohio . 
I had a hard weekend . 
I wonder when < PROPMALE > is going to check his Facebook . I should have reminded him today when I talked to him . 
I talked to < PROPMALE > today . That made me so happy . ^_^ 
Holy crap ! < PROPFEMALE > figured out to get on my account ! :O 
Looking for a job . Hope to get one soon . I need to save up money to go to Japan . 
It's so hot ! I hate summer ! I long for Spring where it is warm and not HOT ! 
My shoulder hurts . Wonder what I did to it . 
Applying for jobs . Hope I get one . Wish me luck ! 
I just got my hair cut . It's short ! :o 
The pain of being seperated from the one you love , why must I feel it now ? 
I am 23 today . Am I really that old ? 
My birthday was horrible . >.< 
I'm so cold ! 
I have an interview today ! I am so nervous !

I am so tired and I have no idea why ! 
I'm cold . And my stupid web cam won't install ! >.< 
I start my training today . I'm a little nervous . 
My computer went on the < PROPMALE > and I lost EVERTHING . And I mean EVERYTHING ! >.< 
I am so cold ! Why does it have to be so cold ?! Curse you cold weather ! 
Ugh . I'm sick now . 
The world seems so cold and lonely with out Shojo Beat . How am I supposed to get my shojo fix now ? 
I should be writing , but I can't get into the mood to write . Maybe I am losing my touch ... That is one of the worst things that can happen to me . I feel so alive when I write . 
I miss talking to < PROPMALE > so much ! I would give up everything I had just to talk to him for 5 minutes . This is so hard ! 
Last night after my meeting , we played a game ... And I just realized how many of us have a dirty mind ... I am still giggling about it ! XD 
I want to get a Nintendo DS . I want to play Harvest Moon : Island of Happiness . I almost had that one guy . GAH ! I WANT TO PLAY IT ! I WAS SO CLOSE ! 
I'm here with < PROPFEMALE > ..... And I am cold . < PROPFEMALE > Jester 
I got to talk to < PROPMALE > Pickett 
I feel sick for some reason . 
I have pep band tonight . It's been about a year since I last played my flute . 
I'm a little nervous . I tried to play some of the music I had laying around . That didn't go over to well . At least I still remember th Fight Song ! 
I guess I did ok last night . I messed up a few times and recovered . I also saw < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . I haven't seen them for awhile . 
Christmas is coming up . I'll be glad when it's over . 
Christmas is over ... Next is New Years ! 
I hate the cold . Why does it need to be so cold ? 
Well , in less than an hour , it wil be one year since I told < PROPMALE > Pickett how I felt about him . <3 
Wow . It has been a year already . I love you , < PROPMALE > ! <3 
Ohayocon started today . Too bad I have to miss it . I really wanted to meet < PROPMALE > Ayres ! T.T 
I really wish I would have gotten to go to Ohayocon this year . 
We have snow .... I hate snow . >.< 
I just want to sleep 
Valentines Day is tomorrow .... I hate Valentines Day . 
Why do I have to be sick ?! I hate being sick ! >.< 
I want some ice cream . Chocolate chip cookie dough sounds good right now . 
I'm just really bored right now .... 
Sometimes I find myself thinking \What is < PROPMALE > Pickett doing right now ? \ " Then I look at my phone and realize that he is sleeping . XD " 
I've had the same headache for a few days now . Why won't it go away ?! 
I want to write , but I can't . I wonder if I am out of ideas . 
I think I may be able to write now . Let's see what I produce . 
I have started to write again ! I am so happy . 
I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > Jester later today ! Woot ! 
Not feeling well , but I will still < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > Jester 
Got to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > Jester and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Schrader 
Jesus Angel Garza gave me a link to the worst fanfiction ever . I swear , my brain cells all cried before they died . 
Here is the link to the worst fanfiction in exsistence : http://myimmortalrehost.webs.com/chapters122.htm 
Classical music is so relaxing . 
I've been playing an online game like crazy lately .... I know I should take a break , but it is so much fun . 
I want to play < PROPFIRST>'s DS . Wonder when he will let me borrow it again .... 
I saw < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland yesterday and it was AWESOME ! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is a flipping GENIUS ! 
I went to see the Titanic Exhibition with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > last week . It was pretty cool . 
I think I have finally gotten over my writers block . 
I never got those pictures posted . < PROPFEMALE > is sad now . T.T 
I am hooked on the song Triple Baka by Hatsune Miku . If your curious as to why , just watch the video . :3 
Wow . I love Hatsune Miku . Her music is awesome . <3 
Wow . My little brothers baseball beat the other team by 20 points ! Final score : 21-1 Fairbanks ! 
Sometimes I wonder I write . Then when I write , I remember why . It's a way for me to vent ; a lot of my own feelings go into it . 
My great uncle finally went to be with God . He will be deeply missed . 
I try not to view death as the end , but as the beginning . 
I know I need to write , but I don't know if I can . 
I am getting an Ulquiorra cell phone strap . It was so cute ! <3 
Grandma is going to sell her house .... I'm going to miss this place . This place holds at least 15 years of memories for all of us .... 
My Ulquiorra phone strap is so cute ! <3 
It's so hot ! Maybe I should get my hair cut again .... 
I gave blood today . They ended up poking me in both arms with a needle . Both arms hurt now . T.T I guess I will try to read Kuroshitsuji to take my mind off the pain . 
I just finished reading chapter 32 of Kuroshitsuji and wow . That one was a creeper ! I've never been so creeped out in my life than I was just now . Lol . My arms still hurt , too . XD 
I think the Twilight series is over rated . 
Shojo manga is great , though I think I read too much of it . 
Hanging out at a family reunion . 
I'm watching anime and writing at the same time . Though I am paying more attention to the tv than my computer screen . Lol . 
Going to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > Jester tomorrow . That will prove to be fun . We always have fun when we < PROPFEMALE > out anyways . 
I got a sunburn yesterday . It's not as bad as it has been in the past though . 
I couldn't sleep so I read \Messenger\ " by < PROPFEMALE > Lowry . It made me cry since someone died at the end . I've been really emotional lately . Maybe It's my lack of sleep . I don't sleep through the night anymore . I always wake up every hour or so . " 
Hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > today . I don't know what we are going to do , but , we always manage to have fun . 
Stupid Adult Swim started to show Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood over again . It was getting really good , too ! I hate it when they do that . >.< 
New episodes of Bleach start next Saturday . I'm so excited . New episodes on my birthday . Can't wait to see more of Ulquiorra and his emo-ness . Lol . 
I started reading Heart no Kuni no < PROPFEMALE > ! It's really good so far ! < PROPFIRST > is a stalker . Lol . < PROPFEMALE > Jester was right . 
No ! The new Bleach episodes are filler ! It's something about filling in the Captain posts . It's making me so sad ! T_T 
My grandma bought me a sword today . It's Kenpachi's ( Bleach ) sword . It's long and kinda heavy , just like you would expect from his sword . It came with a stand , too . 
I want to thank everyone for the birthday wishes I have recieved . Thank you all for wishing me a happy birthday , it made me happy . x3 And my sword is still awesome . XD 
Played Date Warp today and got all but one ending . That one will be hard to get . I wonder how I am supposed to keep Alben in love with < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Finally got all the endings to Date Warp . Now , I'm trying to get a happy ending to Hourglass of Summer , but < PROPFEMALE>'s voice is a little annoying . 
I really want to read more Skip Beat ! and Heart no Kuni no < PROPFEMALE > . I like < PROPFIRST > . He's so cute with his < PROPFEMALE > ears . <3 
BROTHERSWEEK ! If you have a brother who has made you laugh , pulled your hair , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fall , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , can't do without , copy and paste this to your status . 
I want to write , but , I can't think of anything to write about . 
It's raining . It's a little late though . Wish we had more of it during the summer . 
My grandma just called and told me that my little brother was in the hospital . I wonder when my mom was going to tell me ? At least < PROPFIRST > is going to be okay . 
My little brother , < PROPFIRST > Carpenter , is fine . He has a slight concussion . He will be released from the hospital tomorrow . I'm just glad he wasn't injured too bad . 
I wonder what curry bread tastes like ? I would like to try it one day , but , the recipe is really complicated . I want to try a rice ball , too . 
Found a Japanese grocery store in < PROPMALE > . I need to go check it out ! They sell bento , rice balls and sushi ! I <3 sushi ! 
I have an interview coming up . Wish me luck ! 
I was reading Gakuen < PROPFEMALE > last night , and I felt bad for one of the characters . Luca , practically confessed his love to Mikan , but , she doesn't seem to get it . Everybody notices that Luca has feelings for Mikan except Mikan herself . I wanted to cry for poor Luca-pyon ! 
I'm at the place where my interview is . I hope I get the job ! 
I finally got a job ! 
J . K . Rowling is on Oprah ! 
I'm playing Harvest < PROPFEMALE > , and somehow my horse has gotten stuck in the wall of the stable . That's a really weird glitch .... 
I just finished reading volume 9 of Wild Ones and I was in total fangirl mode . There is one volume left , which I need to get . With the actions that just happened in 9 , it looks like there is going to be a happy ending , and my favorite pairing is going to happen . I love shojo manga ! x3 
Start training fo my new job tomorrow . I'm a little nervous to be honest .... 
It's October now . Shouldn't it be cooler by now ? 
First week of training is finally over ! 
I have my first test in my training class on Thursday . I hope I pass ! 
Today is my first test in training . I'm a little nervous , but I am sure I'll be fine ! 
I passed my retest I took on Friday ! I was really worried there for a moment . Got a phone call from Teleperformance saying that they had my test results . I thought they were going to tell me I failed . I was so relieved I started to cry . 
I didn't get my new cellphone today . They said it would be in tomorrow . I hope so . I am so excited about getting it ! :3 
I got my new phone today . It's so cool . I <3 it . :3 
I feel very miserable today . Must be because I hurt a friend today .... 
Today is my data test . I feel more confident about this one then I did about the voice test . I'm nervous and I hardly slept , but I know what I have to do . I need to focus and read the questions carefully . Pray that I pass . 
I think I failed my test . It was really tough . 
Getting ready to take my retest . I feel more confident now . I WILL pass it . Wish me luck and pray for me ! 
I found out that I failed the retest for data . I wonder what I didn't get .... At least I have a < PROPMALE > to get into another project . 
Woot ! Part one of the new < PROPMALE > Potter comes out next weekend ! 
Part one of < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows comes out on Friday ! I am SO excited . This week seems to be going by fast and slow . I'll just play some more Fable 3 . That gnome guy creeps me out .... 
It's Friday ! And part one of < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows is out . I wanna go see it tomorrow . My little brother , < PROPFIRST > Carpenter , is supposed to go with me . I am super excited ! :D 
Wow . < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows was AWESOME ! I can't wait for part two ! 
I got into another project . I'll be customer service for Abercrombie & Fitch . It seems like it will be fun . \ 
\ 
< PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows is AWESOME ! :D 
Got most of my Christmas shopping done last night .... It was crazy . Still have a couple more gifts to buy . 
In training right now .... The guy sitting next to me is being odd ..... 
Just took a test for my training . I think I did pretty well ! Just waiting for lunch now . I'm hungry . D: 
I passed my test ! YAY ! Actually , everyone in my class passed ! 
I'll be glad when these Bleach fillers will be over . I want the main story to start up again . 
It's snowing again .... And I gotta work all this week . Can't wait till Sunday . 
Sprained my ankle leaving for work today . It's swollen , bruised and it hurts to walk and move . Maybe I should go to the hospital . 
Having Christmas on my Dads side today . sounds like fun . 
I have work today and tomorrow . Then Christmas day off . I wanted to sleep in on that day , but I have stuff to do . T.T 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! I have the day off from work today . Have to work tomorrow and Monday , though . It's going to be crazy ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody ! 
Why is Adult Swim showing re-runs ? This crappy filler arc is almost over and they show the episode where this ninja dude gets his arm penatrated with tentacles ! WTF ? I've already seen that one ! I wanna see more of Ulquiorra ! D: 
I plan to spend my day off playing Tales of Vesperia while waiting for the plumber . I really hope < PROPFEMALE > hasn't pulled a Kratos/Zelos and betrayed us all and kidnapped < PROPFEMALE > . 
At work right now with a splitting headache . I can't wait until I get off at midnight . 
Wow . Some people can rude . It's not my fault that I can't realease the payment . Jerk . >.< 
Well , it's another work day . Hopefully today goes well and I don't get cussed at again . 
Whew . Yesterday was really busy . Today isn't so busy . I perfer today to yesterday though . 
I just got off work . It's cold and snowy . I hate Winter . I am waiting to feel the warm embrace of Spring . 
There is a reason I hate winter . It's called snow and cold . 
So happy I have tomorrow off .... Hopes it stops snowing soon . 
Woot ! New FMA episodes tonight ! And I have a feeling that as soon as the Bleach fillers are over , we will be getting back into the main story . Can't wait to see more Ulquiorra . Also , I am going to Ohayocon this year ! I will get < PROPMALE > Ayres autograph if it's the last thing I do . I have set it as my main quest ! ( Fables 2 & 3 reference ) 
I have ten days until Ohayocon and I am so excited ! I have been in a good mood since Sunday . Nothing can ruin my good mood ! Just thinking about meeting my favorite voice actor , < PROPMALE > Ayres , is enough to make me happy ! 
It's snowing outside , and you all know my feelings on the snow . But , when I think about Ohayocon ( 9 days away ) , I don't mind it so much . 
It's so cold out ! I hate winter . I hope Spring arrives soon . ( 7 days until Ohayocon ! :D ) 
I'm for Bleach to come on , and I really hope the stupid fillers are almost over . I am so tired . And six days until Ohayocon ! :D 
Tried to catch up on my shows , but I had to finish a chapter for my story that is filled with Teenage angst . That took all day .... and 5 days until Ohayocon ! X3 
I am sitting here in the library , knowing that I have a TON of stuff I need to get done . I came in here to get 3 books and left with 9 .... ( 4 days until Ohayocon ! ) 
My phone was completly wiped today . It was rebooting itself when I tried to use my IM service . Good thing they backed up my contacts and pictures . ( 3 days ) 
Well , I didn't get a picture with < PROPMALE > Ayres ( I may later tonight ) , but I did get him to sign a hat I bought . He was nice enough to sign it for me before his panel started . I was so happy ! 
Woot ! Finally ! The main storyline of Bleach started up tonight ! I am so happy ! I <3 Ulquiorra ! And I can see more of him ! I'm really sleepy , but I still have Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood to watch before I go to sleep . 
I found out that my cousin is getting engaged this weekend and I was all \wtf ? \ " He should not be with her . She's just using him ! I can't believe this ! This is not news I wanted to recieve while I was at work . >.<" 
I sprained my ankle again today when I got out of my car . 
My ankle feels better today . I'm going to wear my ace bandage just in case . 
I'm getting my hair done tomorrow morning before work . I will be sure to get a new picture up soon . Hope you all like . And < PROPMALE > , I <3 you ! 
According to my cousin , < PROPFIRST > , I am not allowed to share my opinion on his engagement . I thought I had the right the free speech . He's gotta understand that I am basing my opinion on what he has told me about her when they were broke up . 
My phone is being amazingly stupid right now . 
Sometimes , I really hate my job . I guess it just depends on who is calling in . Today is just one of those days . 
I feel bad for the Japanese who lost everything in the tsunami . My heart goes out to them . 
Mending a broken heart is a hard thing to do . I gave him two years of my life . I don't regret it and I never will . I still care for him very much and I always will .... 
I am slowly putting the pieces back together . It will take time to put back together .
