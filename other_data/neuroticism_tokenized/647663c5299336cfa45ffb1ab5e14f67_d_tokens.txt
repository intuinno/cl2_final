My sister < PROPFIRST > is < PROPFEMALE > apparently and , she will remain so for fourty-five and a hundredth hours . 
Yesterday I was at my cousins party for graduating from Law school . Awesome . Go < PROPFIRST > ! 
< PROPFEMALE > had a bad bike crash yesterday . \ 
Her lip was/is really bad . They had a plastic surgeon work on it and , put stitches in it . It was a really bad spot for it . they doctor had said quite a few times that he wasnt going to lie it might be imperfect when it was healed . I watched him stitch her up .. while my mom went to throw up .. jk Im sure she very well might have had she stayed in the room . 
< PROPFEMALE > looks really bad her lip 15 times it normal size . But the doctor was optimistic after it was over , so thats really good . And for such a pain in the ass , she's been really great . A real trooper . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s looking better a bit better ... and getting back to herself . Her lips only like 7 times it normal size now ...

Rang the register at CVS yesterday from 4 to 10 . \ 
Part of training for pharmacy . \ 
Interesting .. Never rang a register so it was new to me . Didn't realize I'd have quite so many customer coming on to me , asking when I got off . Nor did I realize so many people would be coming to the front store so heavily on drugs . I was sleepy w/ 2 hrs of sleep , but overall it was a good learning experience . 
Is dressed up like a 1930's film < PROPFEMALE > . 
Halloween party last night < PROPFEMALE > much fun ! 
A group of ( around)13 year olds at a playground with < PROPFEMALE > kids playing screaming f-this f-that are very lucky they walked away after I got out of the car , and slammed the door ... 
Good Halloween all ? :) 
20 minutes shy of 12 hours of work today . 
The idea of normal isn't what's normal . 
Today by many standards would be a bad one , and it was ( very bad and stressful ) What I must say , what supprises me is that it makes me feel good to do this job 
Who wants to go to < PROPMALE > Potter Midnight Showing !?! I'm nerd but , it will be fun . Its the part1 of the last . :) November 18th !!

I want a pie .. 
The same person just hit on me , and my mom separatly at/in front of the supermarket . Haha wow 
Someone made a mistake that got us to < PROPFEMALE > . That turned into a great thing , we got to all see mommom in the nursing home , because of it . I'm so greatful for today , and glad I got to see her . & hearts ; \ 
Instead of the terror of what will happen .. what lay ahead for the future . \ 
\ 
Just think its a mystery . \ 
Anything could happen . Focus not on the negative for a second , and remember thats includes all thats amazing . \ 
Sitting around worrying you might just miss what makes life worth it . Instead . 
dancing in the rain ... 
Hopefully I dont jinx myself but , DAY OFF . :)

The Kings Speech was incredible . \ 
I take my metaphorical hat off to both < PROPMALE > Firth , and < PROPMALE > Rush . Well done .

Nothing like a good book . Even if the < PROPMALE > you get to read it leads to finishing up at 5am . :) 
22 films to go .. 
Reading birthday cards .... they have happy birthday FROM the cat cards .... 
I love my mom , critiquing the realism ... of a soap opera . \ 
Must get better ... within the next couple hours

anyone want a 20 and 21 year old to sleep on their couch the week of april 10th thru 16th . To save us money for our vacation .. lol 
Don't pursue happiness - create it . \ 
& my lucky < PROPFIRST > are 5 , 47 , 33 , 28 , 56 , 21 
In search of the a life lead with , and filled with passion . Dull , and dead won't work . 
My mind is a funny place to be this time of night . Anyone awake want to talk I don't think I'm falling a sleep anytime soon . 
I miss being 14 staying up all night . Being on the floor from laughing , for so long you had no clue why anymore . Sneaking in thru friends windows . Going to shows . Reading dirty articles in cosmo . ( Reading aloud to watch < PROPFIRST > get grossed out and plug her ears ) Sitting by the lake . Dancing to 80's music . Playing truth or dare . That part of my life is over but happiness has no age limit . 
Yum yum PF Changs . :) Yummy yummy in my tummy . 
Need to move away . Anyone up to be my roommate ? 
Felt very confident I was far shorter then the tree branch before running ... 
Was having my own little recording session for 45 < PROPFEMALE > or so singing everything from Nat < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > to Blink-182 clothed in a mostly dry shower recording it on both my camera , and phone , didn't seem the slightest bit silly till someone came home . 
All my singing today . I feel like doing karaoke . Since I can't and I'm wide awake guess I'll continue to sing around the house . Make believe I'm in a musical . Haha okay maybe not the latter but definitely the former . :) 
Wants spring rolls from Pf Changs .... So many hours yet to go till that possible .. 
Sometimes having a mouth does not always qualify as a good reason to speak . 
I had an older gentleman say to me today if he were just a few years younger I could just jump in the car , and come home with him . Then he could just throw away all his medication , because if he were with me he'd feel so good he wouldn't need it anymore . 
Nice/amusing time with Vanja , and < PROPFEMALE > at Ihop . Haha even when I was out of the dialog . 
The secret of vast riches begins with a single < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
& lucky < PROPFIRST > are 47 , 21 , 34 , 25 , 7 , 2 
So I think my phones going to have to be in calls . Sporadically deleting everything ie text wise today . and since it did it again I better quit using it . 
Birds are twerping , chirping , tweeting , twaping , chaping , chattering . I hear them as I lie . They great this new day , as my previous has yet to make its close . 
Skipping and twirling as I walked out with Vanja ... grandfather watched this whole transaction .. says tell the truth are you guys in there sneaking drugs , at the very least sneaking in drinks . hah :) nope high from being off work . 
This book makes me want to get out my red marker , and make the necessary revisions . \ 
I've seriously considered it several times , even just for practice . 
Yes ! It light , and bright , and < PROPFEMALE > out , and I'm finish with work . I wish I worked 8 to 4 everyday . :) \ 
Being in front store made it all the better .. maybe not get yelled at for not knowing anything about cigarettes , wasn't the best bit . Oh well . 
I've never spent a moment of my life worrying about my butt . Thank you Sir-mix-a-lot , I appreciate your influence on me . 
Watching the first season of heroes with my little sisters . They mention the solar eclipse . When my 6 yr old sister < PROPFIRST > goes \Eww eclipse ! Ehk ! \ " . \ 
Eating italian food with chop sticks aren't I special . 
Yay ! Florida ! \ 
One week , three days . :) yes ! 
Bad , bad , bad day . I want to tap my little red shoes together three times and to magically be April 10th , and my vacation to be now . 
Pharmacy on april fools .... I don't know about this

\The sun is shining in the sky . There ain't a cloud in sight .... And don't you know it's a beautiful new day hey hey hey It's a beautiful new day hey

Doesn't get much better to me . 
They put a candle in my fried rice .... gotta love it . 
My best friend , my sensei , my mentor turns 60 today . He has taught me more then I even know . Our hours of talk , bs stories I believed for years on end before realizing they were total non-sense , starbucks , movies , creating ideas , working out the details . I love you grandad happy birthday ! I can say without it being a nice turn of words , that I don't know who I would be had you not been in my life . :)
