Please\ 
put this on your status if you know or are related to someone killed on\ 
Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that \ 
people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The \ 
Rebel Alliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy , but the evil \ 
Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . 93% won't copy/paste this . \ 
Will YOU make this your status for at least 1 hour ?
