I'm like a puzzle but all of my pieces are jagged\ 
\ 
If you can understand this , we can make some magic\ 
I'm on like that . 
I'm effin ' sleepy . D: Why can't my head stfu ? 
I might see life as basic cable , but I feel life in HD . 
I've been accused of stealing , I'm so without direction , I'm so busy , I have a fucking CHOCOLATE STAIN on my jeans , and I have to be at a wedding . I'M SO PISSED . 
Tap-tap-tap-tap E-O-E-O-E-O !

I know you're leavin ' in the morning when you wake up ; leave me with some proof it's not a dream . 
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor ... *-* 
If you've tried to reach me in the past few days and I haven't responded : My phone has gone AWOL , working on getting a new one . Where are the good men ? Whiskey is the loner's lover . 
Really ? I wake up two hours before work to get ready for work , make sure I have no plans tonight until at least ten thirty , to work for an hour and five minutes ? I paid to go to work today . Ridiculous . 
The rain is calming . :]

feels sick . 
Thunder only happens when it's raining ... =] ; The rain's washing all that negativity away .... 
\An error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it . \ " - JFK " 
is feeling froggy . 
Fracking is short for hydraulic \ 
fracturing - the process of injecting water and chemicals \ 
into shale ( sedimentary rocks formed by SLOW MOVING UNDERGROUND WATER ) to fracture the shale and free up oil and natural gas .... 
WHAT ABOUT PUMPING CHEMICALS INTO OUR NATURAL WATER FILTER SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD FUCKING IDEA ?! \ 
Drilling oil off shore -- < PROPMALE > away from the coast has DEVASTATED an \ 
entire way of life for many , animal's natural habitat , and possibly the \ 
fertility of our very own coastline . Not only the coast of Louisiana , \ 
but the southern coast of the beautiful United States of < PROPFEMALE > . 
So now we decide to decay the rocks made within the earth to fuel our \ 
cars , regardless of it being near life on earth's dearest resource -- \ 
water . \ 
What . The . Fuck . 
It's like I live in a room with only walls , a chandelier , and a door . Behind the stone door lives Sleep . I really wish the hinges would budge , I'd love to see my friend again ... 
Is off to work . 
I wanna make you beg for it and then I'ma make you swallow yah pride .

Have you ever thought you've seen someone , and then you blink and it doesn't look like them at all ? 
l . o . l , smiley face , have a nicce day ! 
Now all the bitches wanna try and be my bestie , but I take a left and leave ' em hanging like a testi ; trash talk to ' em and put ' em in a hefty ! 
Lay in a bath , light the candles , and listen to the piano man take you away . <3 ; 
The only person I do not love is the person who cannot love . <3 ; 
I think I like sleeping so much because I know the piano man will be there playing that grand through the night again . =]

Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near ? Just like me , they long to be close to you . =] 
THE TIME CHANGE JUST SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME ! 
Would you love me if I didn't work out , or I didn't change my nat-u-ral haaair ? 
Errybody around me today has had the bronchitis , tonsillitis , yeast infections , high-ass fevers , flu-like symptoms , sinus infections .... I swear , I am going to bathe in bleach .

Hey now , I really wanna see if you can go longtemps with a boy like me . Hey now , I really wanna be with yah , cuz ' you're just my type , oh na na na na ! 
Being on a diet and hungry while working in a restaurant is like living hell . 
So I surrender , to every word you whisper , every door you enter --- I , will let you in 
I hate computers in cars . 
I've tasted blood and I want more . 
I swear you got me losin ' my mii-i-i-i-i-i-iiiiind ! 
It's never too early to clean your face . 
ATTENTION : If I have not been returning your texts or calls it is because I have temporarily misplaced my cell phone . Yes , the world is coming to an end , so follow your faiths accordingly . 
You know my motivation , given my reputation . Please excuse me , I don't mean to be rude ; but tonight I'm loving you . 
I lie in my bed flipping through tv channels , eating Godiva . I'm smoking my days away reading old e-mails in my old pajamas . What a daaay , me muero .

Thinks it is a beautiful day . 
Has gained some gorgeous introspective insight and learned a new delicious shake recipe . 
The most expensive diamonds are those that divide light the best , and the spectrum that it burns have captivated humans for ages . Life is very much the same . To shine as a person is to take the different lights of the world and send the reflections you glean from them back out in a beautifully unique prism . Balance , humility , and a smile is all it takes to make that \fire\ " glisten ! =] " 
Is seriously thinking about getting the word fame tattoo'd on him . 
Beau-ti-ful woooorld ! =] I think I've found my new hair color today . =] 
You see the lights that stop me turn to stone , they're shining when I'm alone ; I'm dreaming when they're gone . They're call-ing , call-ing , call-ing me home ... ;; Rock with the musicc ;; 
I'm so going to see No Strings Attached tomorrow . 
Ahhhh , cold rain and a warm bed . =) 
My brain hurts . 
Obama , you're talking about a lot of good ideas right now ; let's see how the next hour goes . 
ended up reading 8 chapters in his psychology textbook , and none of them were the ones he needed to read for his next class . 
Tonight is beauty night , and I'm disappearing next weekend to a different state on a super-secret mission ! :D 
All things happen for a reason , I suppose . =) 
Sometimes , its good to just screeeeeeam . =] ; My brain kinda hurts . 
I may be bad , but I'm perfectly good at it . ;] 
Is replaying Resident Evil 5 with a clean slate ; if you have a gamertag and play message it to me ! 
I am just loving today ! =] 
Give it up , put it up , not enough-not enough-not enough ; I'm feelin ' outta ' control ! Give it up , just let your body - Outta Control ! 
Yoga in the night ice , \ 
tonight's hard frost chills my skin ;\ 
serenity comes . 
Who watched Glee ? I was at work and couldn't see it . 
Take a risk to see the stars and ruin everything or start something new and miss it all . These decisions come at me at such an unnerving pace . I'll choose the safe road . =] 
Happy Valentines Day everyone . ^_^ ; 
It is a beautiful day today . =] ; All the love in the air feels nice . :P 
listens to techno to lull him to sleep . 
I'm on the right track baby I was born this way ! =] 
Glee covered My Chemical Romance . I'm just loving this ! 
Thanks to my unfortunate four-hour long diversion at Wal-Mart yesterday , I got three hours of sleep last night and finally finished up all of my homework and my English essay at nine thirty . Now I get to face my school day full of tests and quizzes with some comfort , and plenty of <3 caffeine <3 . 
Feels dangerous and loves it ! 
This place about to blowwww oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ! 
I was literally serving tables in my dreams last night . . . This cannot be healthy . X___X ;
