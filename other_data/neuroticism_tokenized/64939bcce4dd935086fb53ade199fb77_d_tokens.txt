Went to the greatest birthday party ever , with plate armor and weapons . Freaking epic , happy birthday Chaylo Laurino ! 
The last couple of days have been rather contradictory . Friday I participated in one-on-one combat . Today , I got a facial and all of the girls there were jealous of my beautiful eyelashes . Then I danced the night away with a girl I just met , ( who is wonderful by the way ) , while dressed as Mephistopheles . I think it is safe to say I am a well rounded and complex person . 
Crap , apparently housing got wind of my half-double finally . I've been consolidated . Don't think I'll take this lying down , neither I nor Tj Bandrowski , wish to have a roommate , so I'll see what we can do about it . 
This week is too long already 
Is currently taking applications . I have Grace shopping for me and Theora bringing me food . Anyone want to apply for say , concubine ?

8 hour nap today = probably not getting a lot of sleep 
I had a hell of a day . First I took a walk in the arboretum and made friends with some turtles , and then I met < PROPFIRST > LaFranchi and < PROPFIRST > Ryder and we got to play with some puppies , then we went shopping and finally got food and played scrabble at Bucer's .

Ok so today went pretty well actually . Played Dead Space , had a wonderful homemade salmon dinner , got salted caramel ice cream , and went to < PROPMALE > Bay and got two cook books ( because I'm going to learn to cook over the summer ) and the Illustrated Book of < PROPFEMALE > by R . Crumb . Not too shabby .

I want to thank everyone for their very kind birthday wishes ! You all know how to make me feel special ! However , Miszka Evans still gets the award for wishing me happy birthday closest to the time of my actual birth . 
I was given baklava with a candle in it at a turkish restaurant for my birthday . Who's awesome ? Me , that's who . 
So apparently there is a limit of six tags per status , preventing me from tagging all 44 people who wished me a happy birthday today , I guess you'll just have to accept a blanket thank you

Just spent a few hours walking 4 or 5 < PROPMALE > around Seattle with < PROPFEMALE > Ehrsam and her friend < PROPFIRST > , a good time was had by all . 
Guess what ! I published a new note ! I apologize for this one , its preachy , pretentious , long , and has very few jokes . 
To those of you who don't already know , I have a new note out . It isn't a humorous one however , be warned . 
Has had a lovely day so far . Had an excellent breakfast downtown , and even found a quality hat shop on the way home , life is good 
I am leaving for Zion early this morning , but fear not ! I'll be back in contact fairly soon . In the meantime I've uploaded some selected works of mine for your reading pleasure , some poetry , a short story , and a one act play , enjoy !

Is enjoying < PROPFIRST > Briggs ' house very much . I can still ride a horse it seems . 
Is having a very zen time at Theora Rice's house . However , the tour of the summer is coming to a close , how sad . 
Is home after two weeks and a long , crazy person filled bus ride . I need a nap . 
You fools ! I'm not trying to kill you , I'm trying to save you !

< PROPFIRST > Dimmitt : yes 
I just waited in line for 45 minutes for a sandwich , and oh man was it ever worth it . The single best sandwich of my life : Lamb prosciutto , gorgonzola , < PROPMALE > bread , some kind of spread , and onions . 
is in a very odd mood . I feel contemplative , yet have nothing to contemplate . I feel as though I should reflect on what is amiss in my life , but nothing seems to be . Am I missing something ? 
Remember everyone , it is your patriotic duty to set off fireworks today . You see , the British are < PROPFEMALE > and easily frightened creatures , who enjoy hiding in the bushes near your house . Once a year , we must set off fireworks to scare them sufficiently so they scurry back to England . 
THAT , probably damaged my ears some .

My list of hats grows ever shorter . 
I just realized that on at least three separate occasions in my life I have been asked if I am a pimp . I'm not entirely sure how to feel about this . 
had a lovely day walking around Seattle with Theora Rice Bear , I hope you come to visit again soon ! 
What if ? What if God was not testing < PROPMALE > ? What if < PROPMALE > was testing God ? Is a God that would command a man to sacrifice the son he loves in his name a God worth worshiping ? Perhaps < PROPMALE > was making sure God would stop him . This implies an entirely different relationship between man and God . Who is truly the master ? Is it God , who created and can destroy us , or is it man who gives God purpose ? 
I'm achin ' , I'm breakin ' , I'm shakin ' like humans do 
Hot town , summer in the city . Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty . Been down , isn't it a pity . Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city . All around , people looking half dead . Walking on the sidewalk , hotter than a match head . 
I think I will have a good time , AT THE OPERA TONIGHT ! Very little < PROPMALE > of people ripping their eyes out on-stage . That's not really a < PROPMALE > & Sullivan sort of thing . 
Is off to Portland to see < PROPFIRST > Dimmitt and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Beauchaine ! Although I still have , \When I was a lad ... \ " stuck in my head from last night . " 
Is back from Portland . The train was not robbed while I was riding it , not resulting in a show down between me and the bandit leader . I did not defeat him , earning his grudging admiration for my quickdraw/swordcane skills , and a favor to be used at a later point in the story when my life is in danger and all hope seems lost . Sigh ... 
I grew so < PROPMALE > that I was sent By a pocket borough into Parliament . I always voted at my party's call , And I never thought of thinking for myself at all . I thought so little , they rewarded me , By making me the Ruler of the < PROPFEMALE>'s Navy ! \ 
120 years later , and this is still how things work ... 
< PROPMALE > Bay Books and < PROPFEMALE > Moons Ice Cream , it's been a good afternoon 
While I was sitting in a trendy little restaurant , very hip music playing , eating a 3 dollar plate of olives , and discussing with my mother which of our waitresses had the cuter butt , I came to two realizations . 1 . My mother is awesome . 2 . There is a fair bit of dissonance between my life in Seattle and my life in Idaho , and I wouldn't have it any other way . 
Thanks to < PROPFIRST > Dimmitt I now have goggles ! Let the science begin !

Fun fact about Seattle I learned yesterday : In the early 1900's , 10% of Seattle's population was made up of young , single , women who lived within 3 blocks of one-another , and who all put down on the census their job as , \seamstress\ " . When the city instituted a $10 tax per \ " seamstress\ " the resulting revenue generated 80% of the cities ' budget for the next several years . "

You are very interesting . What people expect after first meeting you is very different from are after getting to know you . At the same time , you don't act or behave differently . You are a very subtle person , and I like that . I'm also very glad I did get to know you . 
2 , \ 
I miss our talks , we need do those again . You remind me of myself in some ways , we have very similar self-esteem issues . Even though you are clearly very wrong , but I still relate to them . Whatever you think , you are a fun , attractive person , and we really need spend more time together . 
3 , \ 
I love talking to you , you have so many things to tell me that I don't know about . I'm also glad that you trust me and talk to me about your problems , I'm honored . I'm always here for you to lend a hand whenever you need it . <3

You are the best , but it is so sad we see so little of each other . I love hanging out with you , and making you laugh . You've been one of my best friends since I first met you . It's so rare that I find that with someone , so I < PROPFEMALE > our relationship very much .

You are one of the most spectacular people I know . Kind , caring , and loving . You are also funny and a pleasure to spend time with . I know I can talk to you whenever I need help , you are always there for me . I appreciate having you as a friend more than I can say , thank you so much . You are a wonderful person . <3

I don't spend very much time with you lately which is a shame . I'm always afraid that you have a bad opinion of me , and not entierly without reason . We have a lot of different views and opinions , but despite that we can still < PROPFEMALE > out and talk very easily . 
217 , \ 
I knew from basically the beginning that we were going to get along very well . I think we have a great ability to compliment each other , we are similar enough to get along , but not so similar that we hate each other . Our talents , ambitions , and spontenaity build on the other's very well , so that if we work together , there's basically nothing we cannot do . 
34.6 , \ 
It seems like you are always busy when I try to talk to you lately , which is sad . You've been pretty busy with school this semester though , so hopefully that will change . You are one of the most adorable and optimistic people I have very met , you can make almost anything seem positive . I hope that you remember how to look on the bright side of things , it is a skill that will serve you very well later in life <3

Was thinking about naming large < PROPFIRST > today and realized that the number of the prefix x3+3 gives you the number of 0's in the number . So : million = mon(1)x3+3 = 6 billion = bi(2)x3+3 = 9 trillion = tri(3)x3+3 = 12 ... and so on . Therefore the largest prefix I could find myria( 10,000 )x3+3 = 30,003 .

Are there universal human values ? Three things valued across all cultures are sex , drugs , and rock ' n roll . Sex : All cultures have institutions and regulations about sex . You don't regulate what you don't value . Drugs : Every culture gets high , whether its nicotine or caffeine here or reindeer urine and giraffe marrow elsewhere . Rock ' n roll : Every culture has a musical/oral tradition , we all sing and dance . 
Was asked what I would do if I died and met God , given that I don't believe . To which I pointed out that I have made the most just decisions I could given the information available ; the information and ability to choose both given to me by God . Therefore , God would have to judge me on the content of my actions , not my lack of belief . If God damns me regardless , then God is not just , and why believe in him ?
