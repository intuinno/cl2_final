FREAKING THE FRIGGIN FREAKING FRICK OUT --- REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY FRIGGIN FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW 
Funny , you don't actually need to be alone to feel alone ... and you don't need to be alone to be lonely ..... 
my heart feels jumpy 
just to see you smile , I'd do anything 
I never want to hide my Celtic pride ;) 
really don't understand most people , guess that's why I'm an outsider most of the time :( 
i felt insecure 
sound off 
you don't know me , don't ignore me , if you had your way you'd just shut me out 
Cuz all my friends say I started shooting doubles when you walked in 
you've got your ball , you've got your chain tied to me tight 
Get a little crazy , get a little stupid 
trying to quit smoking-day 1\ 
don't talk to me , don't look at me , just leave me alone 
A light is shining through 
This life hasn’t turned out quite the way I want it to be 
I would die for you 
You are the only exception 
I'm feeling like a < PROPFEMALE > , you can't stop my shine , I'm loving cloud nine , my head's in the sky . \ 
I'm solo , I'm riding solo 
you're supposed to care but all you do is take 
here you are down on your knees again 
I'm trying to make sense of what little remains 
I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming 
I'm a fool , you see , no one knows this more than me ... I come clean , yeah 
another turning point ... a fork stuck in the road 
i can't take this 
I'm down 
you're a bitch but I love you anyway :) 
love me hate me say what you want about me but all the boys and all the girls are begging to if you seek < PROPFEMALE > 
Yes , I understand that every life must end , aw-huh ,.. \ 
As we sit alone , I know someday we must go , aw-huh ,.. \ 
Oh I'm a lucky man , to count on both hands \ 
the ones I love ,.. \ 
\ 
Some folks just have one , \ 
yeah , others , they've got none , huh-uh \ 
Stay with me ,.. \ 
Let's just breathe . 
i can feel you falling away no longer the lost no longer the same , I can see you starting to break , I'll keep you alive if you show me the way , forever and ever the scars will remain , I'm falling apart , leave me here forever in the dark , daylight dies , black out the sky , does anyone care ? is anybody there ? 
grow up , I wish you'd grow up 
Sympathy and prayers to the family and friends :( 
not into fashion ... 
I just can't keep living this way 
Dear agony just let go of me . Suffer slowly , is this the way it's got to be ? Don't bury me faceless enemy . I'm so sorry . Is this the way it's got to be dear agony ? 
RIP < PROPMALE > 
I can’t tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like 
so you say it's not ok to be gay ... well I think you're just evil 
You make me laugh , you make me cry I don’t know which side to buy 
I think my immune system is on strike 
And that’s what makes my life so f*cking fantastic 
There are many things that I would like to say to you but I don’t know how cuz maybe you’re going to be the one that saves me 
Day and night I toss and turn , I keep stressing my mind , mind . I look for peace but see I don’t attain . 
Lord , please take off my blinders and give me a heart like Yours . 
The Runaways was AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Def one of my new fav movies !!!!!!!!!!!! 
I can feel you all around me\ 
Thickening the air I'm breathing\ 
Holding on to what I'm feeling 
I sit behind her every year Waitin ' for the < PROPMALE > to get To tell her Im the one she should be with oww ! Shes popular with all the guys So innocent in my eye I could see her in my life 
“The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason but with no morals . ” MLK 
The needle tears a hole \ 
The old familiar sting \ 
Try to kill it all away \ 
But I remember everything 
You fell away , what more can I say ? The feeling’s evolved , I won’t let it out I can’t replace , your screaming face Feeling the sickness inside 
So you say you’re ignored As it is , Well , give us your sad , sad trip You’re right , I get it It all makes sense , you’re the perfect person So right , so wrong Let’s all live in your imaginary life 
I’m over it\ 
You see I’m falling in the vast abyss\ 
Clouded by memories of the past\ 
At last , I see\ 
I hear it fading\ 
I can’t speak it\ 
Or else you will dig my grave\ 
You hear them finding , \ 
Always whining\ 
Take my hand I’ll be alive\ 
You see I cannot be forsaken\ 
Because I’m not the only one\ 
We walk amongst you 
I hate myself for loving you Can’t break free from the things that you do I wanna walk but I run back to you that’s why I hate myself for loving you 
I love you . 
Say what you mean . 
And everytime she makes a friend , the vicous cycle starts again\ 
More lyrics : http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sugarcult/#share 
Happy Birthday Mommy !!! I love you !!! 
Sometimes I'm a selfish fake\ 
You're always a true friend\ 
And I don't deserve you\ 
' Cause I'm not there for you\ 
Please forgive me again\ 
I wanna be there for you\ 
someone you can come to\ 
runs deeper than my bones\ 
I wanna be there for you 
Since you’ve been gone I feel like I’ve gotten older 
Look around your world pretty baby . Is it everything you hoped it’d be ? 
I'm not always like this\ 
It's something , i become\ 
A terrible weakness\ 
In my nature , in my blood\ 
Save me , oh save me , save me 
I'm going through it everytime that I'm alone \ 
Now I'm wishing she would pick up the phone \ 
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on \ 
Cause I was wrong . \ 
I was thinking about her \ 
Thinking bout me \ 
Thinkin bout us 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Because I’m broken 
Distant\ 
Shifty-eyed and restless\ 
I dream of a presence\ 
With essence\ 
And absence of doubt 
Am I too lost to be saved ? Am I too lost ? My God my tourniquet ! Return to me salvation ! My God my tourniquet ! Return to me salvation ! Do you remember me ? Lost for so long . Will you be on the other side or will you forget me ? 
Let me be the calm you seek . Oh but every time I’m close to you , there’s too much I can’t say , and you just walk away . And I forgot to tell you I love you and the night’s too long and cold here without you . I grieve in my condition for I cannot find the words to say I need you so . 
Some kind of light\ 
at the end\ 
When touching\ 
the edge of her skin 
Imprisoned by a selfish * , chew me up and spit me out\ 
I fell for this so many times , it’s ridiculous\ 
And still I stick with this , I’m sick of this\ 
But in my sickness and addiction , you’re addictive as they get\ 
Evil as they come vindictive as they make ‘em\ 
My friends keep asking why I can’t just walk away\ 
I’m addicted to the pain , the stress , the drama\ 
I’m drawn in , so I guess , I’mma mess , cursed and blessed . 
Where do we go from here ? \ 
How do we < PROPFEMALE > on ? \ 
I can't get beyond the questions . \ 
Clambering for the scraps\ 
in the shatter of us collapsed . \ 
It cuts me with every could-have-been . \ 
Pain on pain on play , repeating\ 
With the backup makeshift life in waiting . 
U make me hard when I'm all soft inside \ 
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed \ 
The arrow goes straight throught my heart 
Here I lay\ 
Still and breathless\ 
Just like always\ 
Still I want some more\ 
Mirrors sideways 
You will be the death of me\ 
Bury it\ 
I won't let you bury it\ 
I won't let you smother it\ 
I won't let you murder it\ 
Our time is running out\ 
You can't push it underground 
There’s a possibility\ 
All that I had was all I’m gon’ get \ 
All I gon’ get is gon’ be yours then\ 
All I gon’ get is gon’ be yours still \ 
So tell me when you hear my heart stop 
Sometimes\ 
I wish I was brave\ 
I wish I was stronger\ 
I wish I could feel no pain 
ok then , guess that is that and I am done ... wow ... so many breaks ... time to move on ... so much love to people in the past ... but it's over I guess ... gotta get ready for the future ... future love , future friends ... please come find me soon ! :( 
feeling sad today 
Life sucks and then you die until then **** it , I’m being forced to survive 
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family < PROPFIRST > . I'm so sorry . 
just when I thought I had hit bottom ... turns out that was a false hope .... maybe I'm just in hell without end in sight .... yep , that sounds about right ... fmmfl 
Happy Birthday sweetie !!! <3 Love you lots :) 
He drinks a Whiskey drink , he drinks a Vodka drink\ 
He drink a Lager drink , he drinks a Cider drink\ 
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times\ 
He sings the songs that remind him of the best times 
life is crazy 
i need an energy pill and a chill pill to get through today .... energy to stay awake .. chill to be a \nice girl \"......" 
is everything speeding up\ 
or am I slowing down\ 
just spinning around\ 
and I don't know why\ 
all the pieces don't fit\ 
thought I really didn't give a shit\ 
I never wanted to be like you\ 
but for all I aspire\ 
I am really a liar\ 
and I'm running out of things I can do\ 
I'd like to stay\ 
but every day\ 
everything pushes me further away\ 
if you could show\ 
help me to know\ 
how it's supposed to be\ 
where did it go ? 
I'm stupid\ 
I'm staying 
I made my entrance , avoided hazards\ 
Checked my engine , I fell behind I fell behind 
Look through your fear , still blind to my way\ 
I reach to hold you but I don’t feel you there , do you ? \ 
Even realize I’m here , am I just wasting away ? \ 
No , wasting away , living , inside you play \ 
I feel so useless , do you ? \ 
And I feel so useless , do you ? 
I don't know where I'm at\ 
I'm standing at the back\ 
And I'm tired of waiting\ 
Waiting here in line , hoping that I'll find what I've been chasing . \ 
I shot for the sky\ 
I'm stuck on the ground\ 
So why do I try , I know I'm going to fall down\ 
I thought I could fly , so why did I drown ? \ 
Never know why it's coming down , down , down . \ 
Not ready to let go\ 
Cause then I'd never know 
Now deleted and defeated \ 
I will stand on my own \ 
Yeah your memory that punches me \ 
has broken the bone \ 
Give me recipes for sorry \ 
I'm admitting I'm wrong \ 
Still your memory that punches me \ 
has broken the bone 
This is the day the Lord has made , let us rejoice and be glad ! 
And well you might say\ 
I'm losing focus\ 
Kinda drifting into the abstract in terms of how I see myself 
hating jax right now ... you may be hot but you're acting like a u know what !!!!!!!!! poor < PROPFEMALE > :( (( SOA )) 
I don't want to be your babysitter\ 
You're a very big boy now 
Would really like to know who the mystery wonderful person is that left strawberry poptarts on my desk this morning for breakfast whoever you are , thanks—and if you see this post please let me know who you are cuz the suspense is killing me :) 
When I stepped into the dance floor\ 
What I saw took my breath away\ 
Anyone but you 
I may seem crazy\ 
Or painfully shy\ 
And these scars wouldn't be so hidden \ 
If you would just look me in the eye\ 
I feel alone here and cold here\ 
Though I don't want to die\ 
But the only anesthetic that makes me feel anything kills inside\ 
I do not want to be afraid 
I feel the dream in me expire and there’s no one left to blame it on . I hear you label me a liar ‘cause I can’t seem to get this through . You say it’s over , I can sigh again , yeah . Why try to stay sober when I’m dying here ? 
I’m not the same I used to be\ 
I think for myself now\ 
I don’t need you in my ear\ 
I’d love to hit you in the face\ 
I’d love to know you’ve gone away 
I cannot receive/send texts right now ...... sorry all 
How many times is it appropriate to say \What ? \ " before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear or understand a word they said ? " 
If I could just cut my neck off and reattach my head to my shoulders without it ummm , yeah . that sounds ideal right now . owwwww :,( 
You don't know how it feels to be me ... 
popcorn should really be outlawed in regards to our work microwaves : / 
<3 Tired of letting \ 
Passive aggression \ 
Control my mind \ 
Capture my soul \ 
Okay you're right \ 
Just let it go \ 
Okay you got it \ 
It's in the can \ 
Before I played it \ 
You knew my hand <3 
<3 I know I can't slow down , I can't hold back\ 
Though you know I wish I could\ 
Oh no , there ain't no rest for the wicked\ 
Until we close our eyes for good <3 
It doesn't matter what I do , I just can't seem to win\ 
But here I go again\ 
And I say\ 
Hey that's the story of my life\ 
I had a good plan but it didn't go right\ 
Oh no I'm overdrawn\ 
I check my account and the money's all gone\ 
Why me I don't know what to think\ 
I finally get aboard and the whole boat sinks\ 
Seems to be the story of my life 
Doing the happy dance :) :) :) :) Yippee !!!!!!! :) :) :) :) 
At pepboys after my tire literally fell off my car while going down the highway ... seriously 
You sound so innocent\ 
All full of good intent\ 
Swear you know best \ 
But you expect me to\ 
Jump up onboard with you \ 
Ride off into your delusional sunset \ 
I’m not the one who’s lost\ 
With no direction , oh\ 
But you’ll never see 
Oh , it’s like \ 
One step forward and two steps back\ 
No matter what I do you’re always mad\ 
And I can’t change your mind
