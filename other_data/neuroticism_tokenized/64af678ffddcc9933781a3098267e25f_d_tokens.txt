It's been a nice little break . 

Mocha , Jannelle and I just went on a run to CJ's and back . Good times aside from the me almost tripping over stupid Mocha ten million times . 
I've got spies ! 
Pride AND Sandcastles are this weekend , and I'm missing both ... Again . 
I just got what will probably be one of the strangest phone calls of my life . 
I hate that I'm missing Comic-Con yet again ]= 
off to LA 
back from LA . 
Okay , so now 50% of my nose is working thanks to a vicks stick . 
wow , 1129 new emails . Way to go old email accounts =] 
I see you . 
I'm about to cough up a lung ! How do I make it stop ? 
A lot is happening and I'm finding out stuff that I wouldn't have thought to find out . 
I <3 Mocha Cappuccino Latte 
Anybody want to go to a baseball game next week ? 
I'm sad to have finish , but it was a good book . Maybe I'll finally finish Dry now . 
can someone please make me go to sleep ? 
Last night = < PROPFEMALE>'s . This morning = McDonald's Breakfast menu . =] Don't you love when family comes to visit ? 
Hi CJ . =] I Love you ! <3 
is really hating wisdom teeth right about now . 
How am I supposed to write an essay on squares ( the geometric shape , not the social group ) 
So who has to wake up early tomorrow morning to finish her square write up ? That'd be me . And who's most likely going to sleep in and probably going to be late for class ? That would also be me . 
Just talked to my dad . And now I do feel a bit better . It's sad to think it took a flood to have us talk ... 
Oh no , my last minuets as a teenager and it's 11:11 . Can I stay young for a while longer ? 
' Just one ? ' 
Where is my binder so I can do my homewhor ? 
We weren't really friends or anything , but R.I.P. < PROPFEMALE > Hall ... You will be missed 
is on facebook for the first time in about two weeks . 
eck , I wanna barf =[ 
Dear 2010 , you were a good year for the most part . Although there were some hard times at the beginning , I meet a really great friend and in turn gained an entire great family ! I think the most important thing I learned this year is to appreciate the people and things I have and I've learned to tell people that I love them , so I love YOU . @everyone . I hope 2011 can live up to 2010 ( it sure is weird to type 2011 ) 
Okay , Auntie Flow I think it's about time you went home you've been here for over a week and I'm tired of your crappy gifts ... 
I LOVE < PROPFEMALE > Avecilla FOR LIIIIIFE !!!! 
ick , school at 8 . 
Does anyone happen to have a ' Worlds of History ' Third editon by Reilly . I'll pay you . While were at it , lets throw in the Payroll accounting ( beig ) , and Earth ( Tarbuck ) . 
I just got this really strong craving for a certin food , but it was so short that I couldn't even tell what it was . ( this happen to me more often then I'd like to admit ) 
just found out that she giggle and smiles a lot when she drives through a big puddle that slows her down just a bit ( not so much for the big ones that make you rev though ) . =] 
I just want to eat everything right now . 
is it seriously only 11:14 ? 
What the hell man , did I just suddenly get hit by a sack of allergens or something ? 
\Ha-choo . Ha-choo . Ha-choo . \ " followed by a lame attempt at breathing out of my nose ... =[ " 
I just came back from the store with bread , peanut butter , milk , sherbet , and lots of JELL-O . With the exception of that milk , I think I'm set for the next few days . I freaking love jell-o ! =] 
I'm feeling crafty but I want to go be active too . Decisions decisons ! 
Why have I been such a facebook whore lately ? 
I know what I'm doing Tuesday at 7 pm , do you ? 
This is what happens after being woken up from a light : Me- \What is that ? \ " < PROPMALE > - \ " It's a the light\ " Me- \ " Change it ! \"" 
... I still don't know who I'm taking to the cirque show Tuesday ... 
Oh my god , I want to eat again ! < PROPMALE > , what are we going to go and get ? I kinda want something salty-ish . 
< PROPMALE > Avecilla check my wall 
I just realized that I'm still not used to being home early . 
So I went out for rolled tacos , but I came home with Subway . I was okay with that until I took a bite . I should have just been the bitch that orders five minuets before closing .... 
fuuuuuuuuuuuck . Was today really the 12th ? There should be somebody to remind you when your car payment is due . 
Stop trying to talk to me , but more improtantly stop pestering my family ! It's creepy . 
You may choose to disagree ( but I don't think you will ) , but I think I looked pretty good today . I know for sure though that I felt Great ! =] 
I'm bored folks . I dont know what to do with myself when I don't have work . Someone help me out here . 
CRAPOLA ! I can't forget to pay my taxes . Hella procrastinator , I swear . 
Taxes = PAID =] 
Why can't I be 21 already , and no I don't want a fake ID . 
So I bought new swim bottoms today , and I'm already loving them . The other ones are great , but with these I don't have to worry about them coming off when I kick off the wall/ jump out of the pool . =] 
Man , ever since the cruise I've just been wanting to go out and party . And poor me , I can't freaking go anywhere I want to go . 
I love my doggie . She's hilariously dumb . =] 
I came to my room to go to bed , but wound up attempting a new < PROPMALE > project , and very much failed at my attempt . 
is not the biggest fan of floral tape . 
I realized that for the past three days ( if not longer ) I've been wearing polk-dot underpants . This prompted a \Stupid Goal of the Week\ " . I want to try and make it to at least Friday continuing this recent trend . I'm confident that I have enough to do it without doing laundry either . Wish me luck . " 
I think swim really kicked my ass today . Bed before nine . What is the world coming to ? 
Damn , I feel like all I did today was eat . I accomplished nothing . 
I did my good deed for the day and donated blood , but now I'm feeling super sleepy . Nap time ? Yes please ! 
I just got home from a viewing and I did not know how pretty my co-workers sister was . The whole thing is just so sad though . 
So , my Stupid Goal of the Week was accomplished ( not that anybody really cares ) . I could keep going , but honestly I'm sick of polka-dots . Stripes here I come ! haha 
The rock climbing party yesterday was much fun . Now Im in the mood to go with my friends . Who's down ? 
Humm . I just got this feeling that I have no real talent . Can you make talent ? 
Dear Keys , I miss you . Please come back to me soon . Love , Keyless Auwie 
seriously , where are my keys ? I came home yesterday , gave < PROPMALE > food , and tok a shower and sat in bed . 
So , I want to not drive to school tomorrow , but then that means no kick it spot after swim ... Whatever shall I do ? 
Do I know anybody who knows anything about Geology ? 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Constran Don't be dumb ! 
Aww , that makes me sad . 
Today I swam for just about two hours . I love that feeling . 
So that two hour swim felt great , but now I want to take a nap but I really should clean up . 
We found < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > then gave them a proper buriel . In the garbage bin . 
We found < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > then gave them a proper burial . In the garbage bin . 
So tonight was the 31 cent scoop night at Baskin Robins . I asked the server dude if we could get three ( it was just me and < PROPMALE > ) and he said he wasn't supposed to but he would . And when we were walking to the car I noticed one was WAY bigger then the other . I'm guessing he assumed it was mine , and he was implying I'm a fattie ? haha 
I think I'm going to buy a good electirc beater and then I'll make macaroons . 
I've been cutting up and drawing on shirts with the most awesomest best friend Ever < PROPFEMALE > Chen < PROPMALE > . =] 
I just got home from my first night of semi actual gambaling . Haha . I lost all the money that was given to me but it's all good . =] 
Just watched Exit Through the Gift Shop . And now , I sleep . 
is debating to try and do this tonight or holding off and doing it during the week . 
Have you seen my parts ( Shorts actually) ? 
I think I'm going to be < PROPFEMALE > ing out in the Hillcrest area tomorrow just killing some time and possibly getting lunch at Khyber Pass ( Indian food ) . Does anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out for a while ? 
I think a squirlle was having some kind of stand off with me earlier . \ 
Also , Why is it that black dude are always hitting on me ? 
I have a feeling my macaroons are not going to turn out as I would like them to turn out . But here's to hopeing . =] 
So my macaroons came out as \eh\ " . They were too flat and wide . I will try again tomorrow . =] " 
Man , that Kid . 
I hate when I can only find half of my swim suite . 
Truffle time . I know I can make these well =] 
I love when I can match my undergaments to my outfit . 
Does anyone have < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE>'s numbah ? We should all < PROPFEMALE > tonight . I'm finally free on a Saturday night . 
Happy Mothers Day < PROPFEMALE > Avecilla , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , May Avecilla , < PROPFEMALE > Avecilla Mendoza , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Avecilla , all the other Mommies I didn't tag . Love you all and thank you for everything . =] 
Hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > June Vergara and < PROPFEMALE > Joy < PROPFIRST > was super fun . Next time we need to have the whole gang , or at least more of it . =] 
Happy mothers day to < PROPFEMALE > Racelis and < PROPFIRST > Wisco as well ! 
How do I get to my first class on time ? Why , I don't go to sleep . 
Not sleeping last night really hurt me swim today . =[ \ 
Can I finally go to sleep now please ? 
humm , what shall I do today ? Hit me up if you have any ideas . 
I was in IB so I decided to go to the beach and take a run . I forgot how much I like the beach , even the stinky Imperial variety . =] 
ugh . Why ?! 
Six < PROPMALE > . fun stuff . 
< PROPMALE > Avecilla , when < PROPFEMALE > Avecilla comes we can hit up all the hot SD playgrounds . 
I signed up for one of those formspring things . I guess you should ask me questions or something since that's kind of what it's for . My username is AuwieJones 
Humm . iMac or inaugural crusie . decisions decisons . 
Spent my morning walking around Balboa Park , followed by lunch at Crab Hut , and finished off with some fun at Boomers . Thanks < PROPFIRST > Vila for keeping me company ! =] \ 
( see , like that =P ) 
is actually going out on a Friday night . How crazy is that ? 
Why don't you want to let me give you money Otay Water ? 
That puppy totally gave me the energy I needed to finish my run . =] 
< PROPFEMALE > Avecilla is the bomb ! 
Who's doing what tomorrow ? Let me know and maybe we can combine our adventures . 
Finally time to go to work . I've been so bored waiting for one o'clock to roll around 
I want to < PROPFEMALE > out , who's down ? 
uuuug . being sick sucks =[ 
Let's turn this into a game . I have 19 status updates about the earthquake on my news feed , how many do you have ? 
okay , so first the game was with the earthquake , and not lets see how many Laker updates we get ... 
So , my first Maiden concert was pretty awesome even with Bumpitz and her boyfriend being so frekin ' close to me , and getting a sprinking of beer all over my left half . Effin ' Bumpitz . This shall not be my last . 
Congrats to < PROPFEMALE > Mallari and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Doctolero Buyco now you're \grown ups \"" 
Damn , I was on the verg of sleep and I got a text . grrrr . 
This shit is Bananas , B-A-N-A-N-A-S ! Wow , I can't wait =] 
Yeah , it has been a while and there's a good reason . I don't want to talk to you ! 
I just realized I have a formspring . Nobody asks me anything , so let's change that so I don't forget again . =] 
I'm up before the sun . Is there a football match on or anything so I can have * something * to do ? 
Hey , I'm not as broke as I thought I was ! But I'm still going to consider myself broke . 
Damn , Germany is kicking ass ! 
I am SO effing tired ! Good night world . Oh Kuya < PROPMALE > Avecilla have you sent Jannelle that text about Ninong yet ? If not would you please do that soon ? 
So Europe will be taking all of the top three places for this World Cup . Woop Woop . 
Hangin with < PROPFEMALE > Chen < PROPMALE > before she leaves for Yapan . I'm going to miss her !!! Chotto kanashi des . =[ ( excuse me if that's wrong ) 
So I'm having oine last night with < PROPFEMALE > Chen < PROPMALE > . I'm super excited for her and hope she returns safely to me and her bibingka ! hehe 
Fire , weiners , S'mores , random songs , fireworks , and dead batteries . I think that is what you call a good Tuesday night . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Gomez , < PROPFEMALE > Gomez , < PROPFEMALE > McColgan , < PROPMALE > Richardson , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > ( I'm not friends with her ? I guess I need to send out a request ) . =] 
Just saw the Sea World fire works for the second time this week . Three hour picnic for a five minute show . I would call that a day well spent . Plus I got to run a mini boot camp for my cousins , it was effing funny ! 
Who knows how to drive stick ? 
I've been home for nearly 7 hours and this basket of laundry is still half unfolded . Un-productive much ? 
As hot as this freaking place is I had a good time ( mostly because I was inside 99.9% of the time ) . Good bye Phoenix , I shall see you again soon . 
So now that I've slept from 9am to 7pm what is there to do ? 
Aaaaannd . I'm off ( to a bonfire ! =] ) 
So even though I only had a little over five hours of sleep I woke up quite easily this morning ( I even woke up before my alarm at one point ) . Last night must have really been a good night . =] 
Does anyone want to go to the beach ? Hit me up if you're down . 
I think I have the best insurence rep ever . When I went to her office to sign some papers she gave me the usual packets and whatnot , but I also walked away with . A folding brush . A mini spatula . and best of all . Three rice scoopers ! =] 
Holy crap . I'm bored . 
Holy Moly , so many unorganized pictures ! 
I have what I assume to be a six foot piece of fiberglass in my car right now . Tomorrow should be fun =] 
I need somebody to go to the beach with . HELP ! 
Let's paint . Right now . 
Ah , registration . How I loath thee . =] 
Driving into work with just enough sun out to have the sky be mostly black but with a touch of blue , pink off in the horizon , a few of the brighter stars sacttered amongst the lights of the planes , and seeing downtown San < PROPMALE>'s skyline ahead of me while listening to < PROPFIRST > Mraz's Details in the Fabric was one of the nicest drives I've had . Ever .

A word to the wise : If you're going to dry your hands on your pants , be sure you're wearing them . 
Jannelle Mendoza I made cookies . Go eat them . 
off to the park with my cousins . I love coming home early =] 
Is it strange that I * want * to take a stats class ? 
Dude ! Am I retarded , or is there something wrong with the picture uploading thing ? 
Oh my word , I'm REGISTERED in 14 unites , and I'm still on the waitlist for a single unit class .. This is going to be a fun semester . =] 
' buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . Hey , I'm a vuvuzela . \\ 
I love my new friends , and that in turn means I love Gizmodo ! < # ( yes , that was on purpose ) 
So I guess I'm going surfing again today ! =] 
Ugggg . Today is not going well . 
I've forgotten how to head a paper . This is a bad thing considering I haven't taken any breaks from school .... 
So , for the past hour and a half I've been regretting that nap a took yesterday afternoon ... 
Who knows stuff about cars ? My window made a loud pop when I went to roll it up , and when I rolled it down it decided to stay down . I think it's lower than it usually is when it's down . 
Boo . 
thirty-nine hours in three days , check ! 
stalker . ( get it , my status is stalker . Stalker status . ahaha . ) 
I just woke up from a dream that I was pregnant . Then I was telling Kuya about how I had a crasy dream and we were talking about how we like to test our subconcious imagination and other cool stuff like that . Then my alarm went off . 
I love my brothers . That means you < PROPMALE > Avecilla and < PROPFIRST > Avecilla . 
People need to learn how to swim . Becasue it would be nice if I would take a breath and not have to worry about someones splashes choking me . 
string by string .... \ 
I eat my cheese 
8 am classes after a hot night where you cant sleep = no bueno . 
Tonight was yet another awesome night with < PROPFIRST > Noles and my brother < PROPMALE > Avecilla . \ 
Happy two week Anniversary Giz Crew ! Hahah , how appropriate that we ended oh so late again . 
Woot ! I got my shirt . Well , not really mine but < PROPFIRST > Noles ' . 
Left this morning around 7:30 and just got home at about 10:35 . School is going well but what's even better is when I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with this awesome dude < PROPFIRST > Noles and do awesome things like play Connect 4 , Dots , drink boba , and eat Ramen all followed by some semi-successful stick driving . =] 
Why does it seem like I onlky seem to attract the crazies ? Can you throw a normal guy my way for once ? =/ 
I love when I Stumble onto Gizmodo . 
Agggg . So much to do still ! Current itentarary : Sleep , Go to work ( and hopefully be on time at 8am ) , Work , Work , Work , Come home , Finish EVERYTHING , Load up , Sleep again and then be in LJ by 7 or 8 am . Phew . That was a lot even just to think about . But I know it will all be worth it =] 
I'm feeling a little tired but I'm oh so stoked for today . I hope to see as many of you there was possible . Happy Labor Day ! 
I'd almost forgotten the obligatory hangout post . \ 
Hanging out at the beach today with < PROPMALE > Avecilla , < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Constran , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Morales , < PROPFIRST > Rios-Ninos , < PROPMALE > Escobales , Allan Balouyot , Nate Wisco , and Jannelle Mendoza ( to name a few ) was super awesome . I'm so tired but above all else I'm super happy . Thanks to everyone who came and contributed to the good times . =] 
With the exceptions of Z scores today was a good day in my books , but I'm really looking forward to tomorrow . Does anyone want to do something Thursday ? < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , < PROPMALE > Lennox , < PROPMALE > Wisco 
Namaste , yo ! 
oh my lord , I'm oh so sleepy =[ 
In-and-Out dinner with the awesome < PROPFIRST > Noles , and < PROPMALE > Avecilla . As always it was a pleasure having our parkinglot shenanigans . =] 
Now that I have all this great advice on what to get I need to go get it . This may end badly . haha 
Two new swim suits in two days . I call that a good two days . 
ugggg . Can you just stop ? 
Thanks for the fun times playing Uno < PROPFIRST > Noles . Coult this possibly be our new parking lot ? 
Today , well I guess yesterday now , was a great day . Started with a tea party and ended with Miss Saigon . WAY AWESOME ! If you were with me at all today you helped with the awesomeness ( and some people made it better just by coming across my mind ) so thank you , thank you , and thank you . I love you all ! =] 
This is me not doing laundry 
Holy crap , awake before my second alarm ? What madness . 
I think I should finish that laundry now ... 
Man oh man , I'm so excited for tomorrow . Four o'clock here I come ! 
just heard a funny yet disturbing story . 
My ride along was fun , nothing serious really so I guess that was a good thing . Thanks again to Mr. Z for having me and thanks < PROPFEMALE > S . Zeljeznjak for setting it up . =] 
Another late night with the boys ( < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , and a guest apperance by < PROPFIRST > Noles ) . There was plenty of parking lot shenanigans , cruising , card games , pillow pets , and demonstrations of just how bad I am at video games . All of which equating to a grand ol ' time . 
Not digging these narly tan lines . If I were just a < PROPMALE > more ditsy I would think I were wearing an off white bikini . No bueno . 
I love the fact that my faher ( Oggie Avecilla ) is teaching me how to swear properly in tagaolg =] 
Dear Xbox , I will conquer you , and I will play Uno tonight . 
Ahhh , I feel so bad ! < PROPMALE>'s right , why Would I say that ?! =[ \

Diaper galore . 
Well , that's a big relief .

Dude , where did the hours of 8pm an 12 am go ? 
So < PROPFIRST > Noles was totally lame and didn't come over today , but he kind of made it up with Uno and an old school/ghetto private party ( aka phone call ) . To completly make it up he just has to come over tomorrow . 
Today is October first . Do You have any idea what that means for me ? I think you know , go ahead and guess . What's that you say , a new toothbrush ? * Ding Ding Ding * Correct ! 
\Go nuts \"" 
I always have the best times < PROPFEMALE > ing out with < PROPFIRST > Noles and < PROPMALE > Avecilla . Tonight was eating with < PROPFIRST > then coming home ( intro < PROPMALE > ) to play Halo which turned into more eating and then a WalMart run followed by a WalMart parking lot < PROPFEMALE > out session . Because our outings are never complete without a parking lot < PROPFEMALE > out . =] 
.. So ... sleepy . Good luck < PROPFIRST > Noles 
< PROPFEMALE > Avecilla is the BEST ! 
Good Morning .

Aww , < PROPFEMALE > sad . I don't like when I get a non-reply . ' Tis no bueino . =[ 
I like it in the first open space available . On the door , on the couch , the bed , the floor , anywhere and everywhere is good for me . 
Alright , Philosophy Exam tomorrow ! I've got my scantron and I've got my bluebook ( Which I've never had to buy before ) . Now if only someone whould give me all the answers ... 
112,500 . and then it was all downhill from there . haha 
I think \I like it in my pocket\ " suits me better . " 
Lastnight I had this weird Minecraft -ish dream , but there were a bunch of people working on mining . It was crazy and I blame < PROPFIRST > . 
< PROPMALE > Avecilla \Have you tasted wine 
..... almost 10:10:10 on 10.10.10 .... I missed it this morning and I will not miss it again ( thanks Jannelle Mendoza ) 
and there it went 
Had fun playing in the Microsoft store with < PROPFIRST > Noles and < PROPFIRST > Adams . Also the eating of food , drinking of lots of water , and waiting for < PROPMALE > to go through the process of shopping added to the goodness . Lastly , hurray for technicalities ! =] 
Three down ( actually up I suppose ) , how many are left ? 
Factoid : I still pretend that I'm a mermaid when I'm in the pool . 
Why am I getting black porn when I search for the Little Mermaid in Google image results ? =[ 
Oh my , the birthday greetings have already started . Since I want to see them all at once does this mean I alrady have to get off of facebook ? =[ \ 
P.S. I will be taking my first shot on < PROPFEMALE > chat . You should come and cheer me on as I fail horribly . =] 
my tummy feels funny with the introduction of two things I'm not used to . Alcohol AND bubbles . 
108,000 
I can FINALLY go to bed . Now it's time for a nap before school . I'm so glad swim was cancled . 
If anyone if free they should stop on by TrueNorth becuase that's where I'll be celebrating aka getting wasted . 
Let it be publicly know that I am sorry for any and all of my actions that led to something negative . Especially anything reguarding work . =[ 
So earlier I got a text but my inbox was full . So if you had text me around midnight you should re-text me . 
Dear everyone , Thank you for partaking in the birthday funness . If you were there for five minuets or five hours it made me super happy just to see your face .

So the streak continues ( and a new one has begun ? ) , 11 weeks and counting . And now that we're in the second set of tens we kind of switched it up and started with a parking lot < PROPFEMALE > out , did our thing , and then had another ( possibly several more ) parkinglot < PROPFEMALE > out to finish off the night . I heart the Giz Crew < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , and with an application that's still processing < PROPFEMALE > Jeninga 
Right before my alarm went off at 8:12 I dreamed that some chick was telling me , \He likes you . He things you're ( super ) cute ! \ " NOw to figure out which chick was telling me and more importantly who she was talking about .. haha " 
Pleaseput\ 
this as your status if you know , or are related to , someone killed on\ 
Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . People must\ 
understand that the Empire is a band of murderers bent on universal\ 
domination . The Rebel Alliance seeks peace for the galaxy , but the\ 
... Galactic Empire continues to kill innoce ... not civilians . 93% won't\ 
copy & paste this ... 
Last Night I was going to watch some Office before bed . I think I watched about five minuets before I fell asleep around eleven . That's the earliest I've gone to bed in ages . Now off to work 
So < PROPFIRST > bought a plane ticket today . He'll be here on the tenth . 
277,505 . Take that Geometry Wars . 
If anyone is willing to do a short Philosophy essay for me I would gladly do some math in return . 
Factoid : If there's a birthday of someone I care about I draw a little cake next to the date on my assignments and notes . 
Jannelle Mendoza is the BEST little cousin EVER !. sorry to all the little cousins i have (: 
Factoid : 21 years ago today my father was enjoying my twelth day of life as well as his 25th birthday . Happy birthday Daddy , I Love You . 
Had a good time at Beauty and the Beast with < PROPFEMALE > Racelis . I think I still prefer the movie =] 
Factoid : I don't like when the wind is blowing from my left side . 
< PROPFIRST > Noles , and < PROPFIRST > Adams . Very good night . Proper update tomorrow . 
Okay , so for the proper update . Last night was amazingly fun even though we did nearly nothing . < PROPFIRST > Noles and I < PROPMALE > out and tried to make < PROPFIRST > Noles dance to ' California Girls ' , attacked < PROPFIRST > Noles and stole his companion cube , took a bajillion pictures , and did almost the same after < PROPFIRST > Adams got there . I so cannot wait for the Kinect Party ! 
I had a very strange dream last night full of things I would not do . 
Oh my gosh ! I just got a BRILLIANT idea . ahahah You don't know how excited I am and this is for something more then a month away . Gosh , I feel like a little girl right now . 
Factoid : I brush my teeth in the shower . 
Beiber wasn't as bad as I thought it might be . Especially since I got to play Kinect . I think the guy was surprised at my knowledge of it ( which isn't much , but a lot more than everyone else there ) . People around us werent standing so it was akward to stand and bop about but I made Jannelle Mendoza bop with me a few times . And to top off the night we got IN-N-OUT to fill our bellies . What a way to start Halloween . 
Factoid : I just had to call my brother to let me OUT of my car . 
About to go trick-or-treat ... at WalMart . 
Will you please get out of my head , just for a little bit . Please . Thank you . 
hgfewrtyjkllo mjy nbvcsasdfgbnm , nbgfew iuytfdsa Asdfghjuytrtyuioiuytrea . hgfdsaSDFGHGFDSAasdfghgfdsa ( Jannelle Mendoza ) 
Well , that was news to me . I guess that's a plus one ? 
Can some one else please go take my test for me ? 
Why do I only have 14 friends that have voted so far . What would Captain < PROPFEMALE > think ? I believe it would be something along the lines of \Unacceptable ! \"" 
I think I'm in need of a paper cutter ... 
So as of this moment I have 26 friend who've voted . That's more than 10% of my friends . Good job you guys , Captain < PROPFEMALE > is proud of you . 
Come on Hawaii , I hope you puller through for us with the Senate . 
Oh my God ! I just found a white EYEBROW hair . What the hecks , man ? 
? BROTHER'SWEEK ? if you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched\ 
you , stuckup for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , \ 
saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong . \ 
Someone you can't do without , copy and paste this in your status . 
Oh man , I have a bunch of energy right now . Where did this come from ? 
Persimmon . Yum ! =] 
Factoid : Presimmons remind of my Great Grand Father ( Papang ) and how he threw a pair of pruning sheers into an orchard . 
So the final count on friend that voted ( and posted it to Facebook ) 32 . That means 14.4144% . Your civic duty for the year has been fulfilled . 
Factoid : I know how to knitt , but I don't know how to stop . 
Hamilton's was awesome with < PROPFIRST > Savago , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , and Uncle < PROPFIRST > . I think I had the most childish meal you can put together about a bar . Also , apparently I'm good enough at shuffle board to get a nickname . =] 
Three hour phone calls at 1:00 am . Good times . 
\You know mommy has a friend named Auwie ? NO WAY MOM ! You're friend is named Ouwie 
... < PROPFIRST > Noles ... < PROPMALE > Avecilla ... < PROPFEMALE > Jeninga ... Good night . 
Okay , so last night was wonderful as usual . This time though we got to throw Kinect into the mix without haveing to go to the Microsoft store ! Neither < PROPFEMALE > Jeninga nor I was able to find the damned two in < PROPFIRST > Noles ' room , got to watch < PROPFEMALE > Noles bust out her Lady Gaga moves and < PROPMALE > Avecilla and < PROPFIRST > Adams were lame and fell asleep ( but at least < PROPMALE > woke up ) . Ended the night with Toy Story 3 =] 
Factoid : I have a love hate relationship with Jigsaw Puzzles . 
My alarm had been going off and I knew it was getting closer to the dreded time where I'd actually have to get out of bed . But how could I still be so tired even if Id gone to bed quite early ? \I'll just hit snooze once more\ " went threw my head several times untill I abslutly had to get up . All of this only to discover I still have an hour of sleep left . \ 
Factoid : Almost all of the moles on my right arm have a \partner\ " and each set of'partners ' are about the same distance from eachoter . " 
Factoid : I love my parents very much . And the fact that I don't get to be with them like so many of my friends get to be with their parent effects me more than people ( myself included ) know . 
I just thought of something . If I have a post from yesterday at ten pm would it say it was posted 23 or 24 hours ago ? 
Decisions decisions . 
If you're down for a bar tonight meet me and some friends at Hamilton's Bar in South Park . 
Okay , Hamilton's was a bust but the Shouthouse was pretty awesome . And it was fun hanging out with < PROPMALE > Wisco , < PROPFIRST > Morales , < PROPFEMALE > Chen < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , and ESPECIALLY Eunseok Sin ! Welcome back to Sand < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > =] 
I just wanted to greet my wonderful little brother < PROPFIRST > Avecilla a Happy Veterans Day ! Even though he celebrated it hours ago the day has just begun here in the states . Happy Veterans Day , Dude ! Love you . 
Factoid : Yesterday at 1:36 pm I got to see my dear friend < PROPFIRST > for the first time in 989 days ( 2 year , 8 month , and 16 days ) . 
So a day I thought our streak might come to a close turned into a better than average hangout . Kicked things off around 8 @ D&B ( perfect place for our 90th day-versary ) D&B parkn lot from 11- 11:50 , gas ( saw a girl on her way to a DUI so we stayed there longer ) INO , < PROPMALE > out in that parking lot drove back to D&B and < PROPMALE > out there again before departing and giving wrong directions . I <3 < PROPFIRST > Noles & < PROPMALE > Avecilla . 
All I have to say if screw the bank . 
Okay Internet , I need your help . What can I do on a Friday night for cheap ? 
Man , it's going to be freaking busy . 
11 posts about the fight . 
So work wasn't as bad as I thought it might have been ( aka I wasn't as mean as I thought I might have been ) . Plus < PROPFIRST > came for the first time since May . So that was a < PROPMALE > plus to my day . haha 
Factoid : Whenever I leave my house I automatically flip the porch light switch . Sometimes this means I turn it off when its dark . 
Since her wall is stupid I just wanted to wish Jannelle Mendoza a happy 14th Birthday . Hey , it's your luck birthday ! Your age matches the date . haha . Don't judge me . I love you a super bunch ! Not just a regular bunch . 
< PROPFEMALE > Racelis is the best !!! :) 
Good luck , < PROPFIRST > Noles . 
Breakfast at Manila Sunset Grille , tennis class , beach , ice cream , a walk around Old Town San < PROPMALE > State Historic Park , lobster dinner ( where I saw Ninong and < PROPFIRST > Wisco ) , a bunch of crappy drivers on the 5 , and a walk through Balboa Park park to finish off the night . =] 
I can't believe I missed that woot ! Those would have made perfect presents =[ 
Okay , maybe eating that much pudding was'nt such a good idea . 
Factoid : Today I have not one , but two tattoos . 
2.33 pages of 4 . Check ! 
An early but fun night with the Giz Crew plus two . Thanks for partaking in the fun and early FREE games < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , < PROPMALE > Escobales , and Eunseok Sin . =] 
Factoid : WheneverI eat a sandwich I have to eat all of the crust before I start to eat the middle . 
... < PROPFEMALE > sigh .. 
Factoid : I love driving under an overpass in the rain . 
I really don't know what's going to happen today . Typical me says I'll cry but then something else is telling me I won't . 
Ah , 12 days and all we have are two pictures ( that aren't even very good ) =[ 
Thank you Mr < PROPMALE > H . You are a very sweet man , and I didn't know that\ 
was even an option . It may have only been an extra hour but your\ 
kindness made this day that much easier . 
Standing at the gate I thought I was going to be fine . Going down the escalator I had a moment of doubt . Walking to my care I was once again okay . Driving down Harbor Drive I was still okay . And then I got to Grape .... 
I just woke up from a five hour nap and will probably go back to bed no problem later . 
< PROPFIRST > Noles is super awesome and wonderful . 
< PROPFEMALE > Avecilla is a goober . 
yes , < PROPFIRST > Noles ? 
< PROPFIRST > Noles is a total cheater ! 
< PROPMALE > Avecilla , I really do like you . 
< PROPFIRST > Noles . This is WAY better then BomberMan . 
Man oh man ! SO many good memories were made tonight . < PROPFIRST > Noles , you were right about things not being akward . Well , except for that one thing . I love hanging out with you and your family . Your dad was kind of busy but I'm sure he's just as awesome as the rest of you . Thanks for the Baja Fresh ( I just realized that trip was a little bit funnier now ) < PROPFEMALE > Noles , and thanks for hanging out < PROPFIRST > Noles . =] 
I hate to have emo status updates , but I'm feeling rather meh . 
< PROPFIRST > Noles to the rescue yet again . You really do rock . 
CyberMonday . The only thing it's good for to me , Underpants from Aeri . =] 
That was not a nap . And now I get to be up all night . 
Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I hope that my friends will be one of the 3% who do ~ even for just an hour ~ in honor of those who never won the battle , and for those who are still fighting . 
Dear phone , I don't want to send ZXCVNBM , ZXcVNBM , ZxCVNBM , ZXcvnbm , or any other combination of those letters . Thank you . 
With the exception of my phone being all wacky , today was a good day . Instead of having a 12 minute swim we got to just have fun diving or hanging out in the deep pool , and then hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Noles was awesome because I got to learn more stuff about him and it was also SUPER hard to keep his new puppy a secret ! Oh , and < PROPMALE > Avecilla was there ( kinda ) when < PROPFIRST > and I were hanging out . 
Event making time ! 
Factoid : I have so much to do and such little motivation to do it . 
Grumble grumble ! Such a stupid mistake . 
Although the day is nearly done , and she doesn't have a face book I just wanted to wish my one and only Nanay a very happy birthday and I'm glad I was able to celebrate with her . I love you Nay ! 
Going out ... at 11:10 . I don't even knbow where I'm going . haha 
Had a random ass < PROPFEMALE > out with Surge Ponce from 11:30 to past 3:00 . And we almost made it to the bridge . haha . Good times , good times . =] 
My underpants have arrived ! I'm so happy ! =] 
So apparently there's this number game going around where you message someone ( i.e. Me ) and then you get a status update with your number and a comment about you . So lets see some < PROPFIRST > folks . 
#83 : You seem like an interesting person and I have no idea what you're like aside from what I see on FB . Oh , and you have an awesome name . 
3874098217304821734712098374098217304982165743695832945287079317458732049875098437098574324254674585709432875098433874098217304821734712098374098217304982165743695832945287079317458732049875098437098574329851324213470943287509843387409821730482173471209837409821730498216574369583294528707931745873204987509843709857432921342134128570943287509843387409821730482173471 : I miss our dance , but more importantly I miss you ! 
#26 : Before I met you I was kind of bummed that I was meeting you when I did , but you were super awesome and I felt bad for haveing my previous feelings . It would be super fun to < PROPFEMALE > out with you again . Disneyland ? 
Oh Tetris how I've missed thee . 
\scary as hell . - < PROPMALE > Avecilla " 
I can already tell . These straight lines are going to be the death of me . =/ 
What the hell ?! Since when has it been a quarter after one ?! And don't tell me , it's a rhetorical question . =P 
I'm going down to the ghetto . See ya there . 
< PROPFIRST > Noles ' s birthday was a success in my opinion . Good food , good games , and even better friends . It was fun hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > Jeninga , < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPFIRST > Adams , < PROPMALE > Avecilla , and < PROPFEMALE > Noles . I would also like to thank Thaniel and < PROPFEMALE > Noles again for their troubles ( I feel like there's a better thing to say but heck , it's 4:05 am ) . P.S. I'm super hapy that < PROPFIRST > enjoyed his gift ! 
Wine steals was fun . I had a great time hanging out with old friends . San < PROPMALE > will miss you Mr and Mrs < PROPFEMALE > S . Zeljeznjak and < PROPFEMALE > Zeljeznjak . 
Factoid : My hair is long enough that I no longer need a hair tie . I can simply tie it in a knot and it will stay put . 
ugggh . I hate when I mess things up . Even if it is something that will probably go unnoticed . 
So three am , we meet again . 
Unexpected < PROPFEMALE > out with @ < PROPFIRST > Adams . Thought @ < PROPMALE > Avecilla & I were just getting hair cuts from him but got lunch , went to CostCo Edwards the mall & napped at < PROPFIRST > Noles house waiting to surprise him when he got home from his final(congrats ) < PROPMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > at his house and then heading back to Edwards to watch the midnight show of Tron . Didnt think Id be < PROPFEMALE > ing out with < PROPMALE > sans < PROPFIRST > but it's WAY fun 
Factoid : When I brush my teeth I always start on the left side of my mouth . 
PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this . Please share , knowledge is power . 
When I woke up this morning my phone charger cord was wrapped around my neck . Given how much I toss and turn maybe sleeping with my phone at my head is not the best idea while it's charging . 
< PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPFIRST > Adams , and < PROPMALE > Avecilla are we hanging out tomorrow or what ? 
Hammer time ! And by ' hammer ' I mean shower , because I smell like work . 
I feel as if the cold weather has made my TOMS shrink because they're pretty tight right about now . 
Work , shower , wait , drive , greet , dinner , chill , crave , pick-up , race the clock , enjoy , WKUK , fall asleep , chat , drive , snack , check , post , CRASH ! 
Christmas is starting off just as it always does . With a butt ton of bibingka . 
Time to shower and get the bibingka stink off of me so I can go to a party where I will most likely sleep . =] 
It has pockets !!! =] 
So I thought some hot water with lemon would be a good idea because I'm sick , right ? I don't think a whole lemon and just water was the best idea . 
A minute ago I tried to say something only to find out my voice is broken . 
My voice is fixed !... kind of ... 
Factoid : I just got a nosebleed . That's only the fifth one I can ever remember having . 
I GUESS I'll be going to bed now since there's nothing else to do ... 
Dammit , I really do not like how three o'clock will just creep up on me like this all the time . Does it not know that I have work in just a few short hours ? 
< PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPFEMALE > Jeninga , and < PROPFIRST > Noles twist and pull 
I thought NyQuil was supposed to make you sleepy ? 
Oh wait , I think I feel it now . 
I'm pretty sure I've used at least half a box of tissues sine yesterday afternoon . Thank you Puffs Tissues . 
Factoid : I find ending phone conversations completely awkward . 
For those of you that care :\ 
There's this site called spokeo.com that's basically a super address book . It has your address , prox . age , household income , and the other people living at your address . All that you have to do is type in a name . Remove yourself by searching your name , copying the URL of your < PROPFEMALE > , then go to the bottom of the home < PROPFEMALE > and click on the Privacy button and follow the directions from there . 
Even when I'm feeling down I only know how to draw happy . 
Factoid : I love and miss Chris-Tata < PROPFIRST > . She's been gone for far too long . Maybe one day I will see her in Marikina . =] 
Ugh , this is ridiculous even for me . 
Wow , and to imagine I was feeling so bad for a thought . 
Midified Mudslide . D-Lish ! 
Who's 21+ and wants to do some adventuring ? 
Whatever ! < PROPFEMALE > Gomez , < PROPFEMALE > Gomez , and < PROPFEMALE > McColgan Anthenill 
It's better than magic . It's like ... Unicorn Farts . Magical flatulence . \ 
Oh < PROPFIRST > Noles , how I love us . haha 
Yay for < PROPMALE > Avecilla and Rocell < PROPMALE > ! =] =] 
I wasn't expecting to take a name for that long . Ay yai yai . 
Eating Cap'n Crunch Oops All Berries by the handful . 
Oh my gosh , The Mechanic was a good freaking movie . Thanks < PROPFIRST > Gayler ! 
WTF , Mate ? I am < PROPFEMALE > tired . 
Dear Ice Cream , if you could please find a way to my possession/mouth that requires little to no effort I would very much appreciate it . Fell free to bring your friend < PROPFEMALE > along too . I love and miss you . -Auwie 
Dear Facebook world , I love Jannelle Mendoza . =] 
Jannelle Mendoza , did I give you my Orange Bang earlier ? 
Factoid : Today was the third Tuesday in a row that I got gas at the Rancho < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > CostCo . I do believe that I can get more specific and say between the hours of 4:00 and 8:30 . 
Time to get my ass in shape . Yay , gym ! 
Factoid : For as long as I can remember I've loved the classic style of pin-up girls . 
Factoid : Today I accidentally ( that part is probably a given ) sank my finger into a molten pool of cheese . 
\I don’t love you ; I barely know you . But I’m fascinated by your potential \"" 
< PROPMALE > Avecilla . < PROPFIRST > Noles , < PROPFIRST > Adams and myself are about to do the laser tag thing . And if that fails , we're doing the < PROPMALE > E . Cheese thing . 
I just got the best < PROPFIRST>'s Day hug from Izzy . She always makes me smile . =] 
-Heeey , I went to < PROPMALE > E . Cheese for my threed birthday . \ 
-You mean your third ? \ 
-No , my threed . <3 
Factoid : Plucking my eyebrows will make me \ 
a ) sneeze\ 
b ) have a stuffed nose\ 
c ) all of the above . 
Factoid : I dislike that so many Girl < PROPMALE > Cookies come in a pack of 15 because I have a slight OCD that makes me eat in pairs . 
Even though I've been home for nearly two hours I'm still full from the Valley View buffet . Thanks < PROPFIRST > B Vila for letting me be a passenger in my own car =] \ 
and no thanks Bwayan Cwuzz for putting your feet right next to my head =[ 
Waiting for Jannelle Mendoza to get out of cheer so I took her laptop to kill some time but my fingers are freezing making it hard to type . =[ 
Dammit , an hour of using a < PROPMALE > and I still can't get used to my stupid way of scrolling after nearly two hours ... 
Factoid : 90% of the time I'm driving with my cruise on . 
< PROPFIRST > Verdugo , I love how we have our random ass lunch dates . 
Auwie vs . Samoas round two . FIGHT ! 
I'm going gay tonight . =] 
Factoid : There are currently 9,272 unread emails in my inbox . I'm very tempted to have a ' 10,000 th message prize ' if it's a facebook alert . 
Auwie VS . Ice Cream Cake . Round one . 
' You need to < PROPFIRST > or your PJ's will get dirty . From poop and stuff . It's gunna sweep across like rain . ' \ 
Is that good enough for you < PROPFEMALE > Racelis 
Does anyone have some flyer < PROPMALE > they'd like to send my way ? =] haha 
Oh man , this pasta is seriously rockin ' my socks . 
< PROPFEMALE > Avecilla , when is the new ' series ' of Misfits supposed to start ? I miss it ! haha 
Factoid : Whenever I use the bathroom at home or at a friends house I always put the cover down before I flush . 
I really should get on frosting those cupcakes ... 
Well , I guess I'll be going to bed before 2 am for a change . Yay me ... 
Hurray ! I saw the shuttle . Normally I wouldn't really care , but this will be the last one ( at least for a while ) . And now for Hamilton's Bar . =] 
Factoid : I've only had three jobs my entire working life , and for about eight months I was working all three at the same time . 
Waiting for my Bestie < PROPFEMALE > Jeninga so we can BAKE ! =] 
Factoid : I was just on my dads facebook < PROPFEMALE > and I almost cried . 
Factoid : I haven't left the house all day . As a matter of fact , I've hardly left my bed . 
So I just tried cutting my bangs and the result isn't too horrible but you'd think I'd learn from past attempts to leave this to a professional . 
Can you come with me ? Please ? Please . Come with me . We'll go together . We can hold hands . \ 
Jannelle Mendoza 
I'm still deciding on how much I like ' enter ' to comment . 
Oh man , I've been coughing so much my abs hurt . Unfortunately I found this out while I was sleeping . 
bye bye battery . RIP 
What a bummer ... BUT everything will work out in the end . 
Instead of waking up in an hour I'm just going to take this now . Hopefully this is goodnight , or whatever you want to call going to bed at 6:20 am . 
Even though crowded bars aren't really my scene I enjoyed celebrating my best friend < PROPFEMALE > Chen < PROPMALE>'s birthday at the Tavern . And some drunk guy trying to touch me at < PROPFIRST>'s sure was an interesting way to finish things off . 
Factoid : When I eat Lucky Charms I only eat the oat part , so at the end I'm left with marshmallows and milk . I then eat said marshmallows according to shape . Because of this Lucky Charms is the only cereal I do not have a second bowl of . 
This is proving to be more difficult than I had imagined . Or maybe I just have barbecue brain . 
Decisions decisions . Would be easy to make if I had more money . haha 
So I just had this weird dream where there was this GIANT wave that was super close to some restaurant ( like you could easily throw something into it ) and it was just kind of suspended there . The water was moving and everything but the wave was just this massive wall of water that stretched as far as the eye could see for at least an hour . 
My plan of action :\ 
1 . Make some oatmeal\ 
2 . Eat some oatmeal\ 
3 . Enjoy said oatmeal\ 
4 . Yardage Town ! \ 
( if only I had my mommy < PROPFEMALE > Avecilla to help me out =[ ) 
Just when I thought this thing was easy it got hard as shit . But I can't give up ! 
So sleepy , but I left my brother without his bed . So I must clean first . See Kuya , I do love you . 
Factoid : If I'm just standing around I have a tendency to tondu and/or do attitude swings ( especially if it's cold ) and I even still finish with a plié . 
This project of mine is so much of a pain . And I really have absolutely no use for it . I'm going to go for a run instead . 
In the 20 minuets I've been back I think I've sneezed about 30 times . Now 31 and 35 
Factoid : When I see a caravan of flatbeds carrying just a few items each I assume they're parts of something extravagant . Like a space ship , or a super secret underground military base . 
Factoid : I have at least seven stickers of mini fig heads placed around the inside of my car with an additional three on the back of my phone . 
Factoid : I buy scented windshield washer fluid . Subsequently , I go through it much faster than most people because of the insane amounts I use just so I can smell it through the vents . 
haha , I think it's funny when an ex does something stupid . 
Two nights in a row ? The crazy things work does to me . 
I just watched a Korean movie for the first time in .... a year and a half ? I'd already seen it , but I forgot I had ( even though it was one I knew I wanted to see ) . I think I have to do this more often . 
Effing cake pans ! Where are you ?! >=O 
I posted it last night and I'll post it again . I fucking love < PROPFEMALE > Chen < PROPMALE > . She's the bestest . =] 
Screw you GIRP . But at least I don't suck as bad at this as I do at QWOP . 
Factoid : When given a choice I always choose a teaspoon over a tablespoon . 
Dude wallet , where are you ? 
I've retraced where I've been since last Tuesday ( 3.22 ) and I'm lead to the conclusion that my wallet is either in/around my bed or in my car . 
fuuuuuuuuggg . Where the eff is my wallet ?! =[ 
And it is found . =]
