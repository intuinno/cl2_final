BEST DIVORCE LETTER EVER\ 
Dear Wife , I’m writing you this letter to tell you that I’m leaving you forever . I’ve been a good man to you for 7 years & I have nothing to show for it . These last 2 weeks have been hell . ... Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today & that was the last straw . Last week , you came home & didn’t even notice I had a new haircut , had cooked your favorite meal & even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers . You ate in 2 minutes , & went straight to sleep after watching all of your soaps . You don’t tell me you love me anymore ; you don’t want sex or anything that connects us as husband & wife . Either you’re cheating on me or you don’t love me anymore ; whatever the case , I’m gone . Your EX-Husband P.S. don’t try to find me . Your SISTER & I are moving away to West < PROPFEMALE > together ! Have a great life ! \ 
\ 
—— Dear Ex-Husband Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter . It’s true you & I have been married for 7 years , although a good man is a far cry from what you’ve been . I watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining & griping Too bad that doesn’t work . I DID notice when you got a hair cut last week , but the 1st thing that came to mind was ‘You look just like a girl ! ’ Since my mother raised me not to say anything if you can’t say something nice , I didn’t comment . And when you cooked my favorite meal , you must have gotten me confused with MY SISTER , because I stopped eating pork 7 years ago . About those new silk boxers : I turned away from you because the $49.99 price tag was still on them , & I prayed it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed $50 from me that morning . After all of this , I still loved you & felt we could work it out . So when I hit the lotto for 10 million dollars , I quit my job & bought us 2 tickets to Jamaica But when I got home you were gone .. Everything happens for a reason , I guess . I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted . My lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you won’t get a dime from me . So take care . Signed , Your Ex-Wife , < PROPMALE > As Hell & Free ! P.S. I don’t know if I ever told you this , but my sister < PROPFEMALE > was born < PROPFIRST > . I hope that’s not a problem . 
* puts up the do not disturb sign * .... earbuds in place , pinot on deck ... dissecting this < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > album ... pen n paper just in case my thoughts stomp on me . #set in the groove , i . ll return fed i.m sure . one . 
Saturday morning , Part 2 : Can't return to sleep so now I am waging war on my house ... scrubbing the paint off the cabinets , punishing the floors with my mop and broom , baseball tossing clothes in the washer and dryer , poisoning the air with cleaning agent toxins ...... and listenin ' to < PROPFEMALE > wright . #chronicles of the insanity of hormonal discord * puts up my beware of fool sign * 
Goal for the day : Keep my opinions to myself . #shush me . 
Learning alot these days .. well maybe not learning as much as being willing to accept and being mindful of the truth . Like , u can't expect what you're not willing to be . Judge them , they judge you . Everything doesn't have to be said . Don't lose friends over b.s. Be a better friend . Choose your battles . Fix it if it's worth it . And the list goes on . #bottom line .. know better , do better . easy ? no . necessary ? yes . To the people who count , and there are many , I love you . Now that's easy enough . 
We need to teach our daughters ( and the women who don't know it ) to distinguish between a man who flatters her , and a man who compliments her .. a man who spends money on her , and a man who invests in her .. a man who views her as property , and a man who views her properly ... a man who lusts after her , and a man who loves her .... a man who believes he is a gift to women , and a man who remembers a woman was gifted to man . #not the author but couldn't have said it better . know your worth . 
fb : i see some good shit , bad shit .. crazy shit .. funny shit . now , i'm tired of da shit ... for the day . #signing off .. but i love yall tho ! 
<<<< this face right here says it all . 
Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood . \
