Pricks . >_> 
I feel as though I just had quite the epic adventure . :3

If someone gets so upset that they freak out and delete you , it means you win . Whether you're fighting or not . You just , win . \

It seems slightly cruel to have so many seafood restaurants near the beach . 
I have < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > stuck in my head . \ 
But , my brain seems to think the chorus should say , \Billy Mays is not my lover\ " instead .. O.o " 
< PROPFEMALE > was here . xD 
\Ima come to yo house and < PROPFIRST > yo bacon !! \"" 
Dear Biology , I hate you . Oh , so very much . 
I like that you're consistent . The problem is , is that you're consistently disappointing me . 
I had a dream that < PROPFEMALE > was giving a lecture . It would appear that now , I can't even get a break from school in my sleep . 
Running through the school hallways at night is totally awesome . Just sayin ' . 
All day I've been hearing , \It's gonna snow ! \ " \
