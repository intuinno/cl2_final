Watching the Hurt Locker 

Contact just fell off my eye and flew halfway across the room , contemplating breaking something . 
Having a < PROPFEMALE > Mars marathon , forgot how good this show was . 
Just looked outside , have the sudden urge to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas 
It is so freaking beautiful outside my window right now , WHY don't I have my camera 
Found the original vinyl of Pink < PROPMALE>'s The Wall in a closet , this day is officially awesome . 
LIGHTS Happy Birthday LIGHTS ! 
LIGHTS Take me river , < PROPFEMALE > me far\ 
Lead me river , like a mother\ 
Take me over to some other unknown\ 
Put me in the undertow 
LIGHTS Winter left a cover \

But I've got my boots \

When I'm in the summer I forget how much I love her \

Cause I could watch her dance \

If anyone asks , I'm watching the < PROPMALE > wedding because I have insomnia . 
Sooooo , can we be done with the whole Iraq business now ?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY DOES MY TOOTH HURT SO BAD !? 
I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE !!! 
Well they couldn't save the tooth , but the left side of my face is pretty much completely numb so I guess it's all good . 
Anyone know how long it takes for Novocaine to wear off ? 
Anyone know what it's suppose to look like after you get a tooth pulled ?

I wonder if the anti-christ was Obama or < PROPMALE > Gates , moment of truth * crosses fingers * 
Five minutes in , feels like five years , war changes a man . 
I wonder if there'll be zombies , zombies would be cool . 
I wonder if they'd be < PROPMALE > Snyder zombies or Romero zombies 
Maybe it'll be like Left 4 Dead ? 
I wonder if I can get my own personal Witch ? .... Y'know for ... for charades , innocent innocent charades . 
What if Jesus really is black , I wonder how Limbaugh would take it ?

Y'know , I'm tentative about saying this , but I think B.o.B just became my favorite rapper . 
So , X-Men : First Class is just like the best fucking movie . 
Disregard what I said earlier , Kid Cudi's the best rapper alive . 
I'm not sure how I feel about < PROPFIRST > , the Creator . 
Anyone see < PROPFIRST>'s performance at the MTV Movie Awards ? 
Anyone heard Black Thoughts 2 ? Way better than I thought it'd be . 
It's nice having a lot of people at the house . 
We just brought the urn home . 
Well that was an interesting night . 
Just finished a short story I've been working on for awhile , contemplating showing it to anyone . 
Going to see < PROPMALE > Potter tonight , I'm psyched . 
Deathly Hallows Part 2 was pretty good . 
Dear Mr. President , I heard you say you will not guarantee SS checks if the debt ceiling isn't raised . Why is it the scare always has to do with SS , Medicare , & our Soldiers pay ? Why not stop your own pay or all of Congress to save much more money for our country ? Why use the Seniors , Soldiers , & our needy as examples ? Take the money from those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? \ 
Repost if you agree ... 
Sorta has two jobs now . 
I'm on Google+ , finally . 
Went walking around in the fog earlier , why did I forget my camera .
