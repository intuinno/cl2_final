IMAX is stupid . I will never see another IMAX movie again . The only good thing is that it's 70mm . It was the wrong aspect ratio , screen was 1/4 of the size I thought it was gonna be , and far less spherical . I guess I was thinking of IMAX-dome/Omnimax . The 3D seemed to have less depth , but maybe it was just me . Don't see Avatar this way , go see it in \regular screen\ " 3D . " 

Suddenly , I have no job now , I have hardly anything in my portfolio since the last ten years was confidential work , and want to go to Los < PROPFEMALE > to get a special effects job , one of the hardest things to get . How am I going to do this ? 
is feeling good , strangely enough . Got a nearly guaranteed job and an apartment in North Hollywood . Just gotta figure out how to NOT get a job here so I can collect a couple more months of unemployment . 
Skinny Puppy in Philly in mid Nov ...... just when I'm broke as a joke .... Arrgh ! 
Just saw Avatar-3D . If < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > wasn't the most famous director before(which he wasn't ) , he is now . The story looked kinda so-so on the commercials , but it was absolutely fantastic . Everyone HAS to see this movie , in 3D that is , its meant to be . Imax3D may be even better . This is the new 3D , its nearly perfect . You have never seen a movie like this before . Truly revolutionary . Go see it . 
Bored , bored , bored . I have nothing to do tonight . Think I might go see Avatar in IMAX 3D by myself ....... 
I don't have many heroes , but Conan O'Brien is definitely one of them now . The rare individual with true integrity . Sacrificing himself for what is right . BOYCOTT NBC ! 
Conan Rules . Best sign out of any show , EVER . True class act . 
iPad = Stupid . = Me losing hope in design , somebody please , get it right , it is so simple . = Do I have to do it myself ? 
Awesome Covenant show . < PROPFIRST > Myer from Haujobb filled in for a missing keyboardest . Unique show .... 
A < PROPMALE > went hunting for bear . He walked five < PROPMALE > east of camp , but couldn't find any game . So he walked five < PROPMALE > north , where he saw a bear and shot it . Then he walked five < PROPMALE > directly back to camp . What color was the bear ? 
How big is this underground oil reservoir and could it possibly lead to the extinction of humans ? 
If you remake a movie you should be banned from film-making and treated \ 
like you bet on your own team , like < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . The only exception is if\ 
you are the original director and you're unhappy with your first \ 
film , then remake it all you want , it's yours . You don't see the < PROPFEMALE > \ 
< PROPFEMALE > being repainted by another artist to make it \better\ " because we \ 
I had to break that into two parts because stupid facebook doesn't want me to have that much on my mind ........ 
I also have a two seat reclining couch(white & blue , red highlights , OK shape ) , twin bed frame w/cabinet headboard(OK shape , water stain on headboard top ) , twin leaf folding kitchen table w/chairs(OK shape , top marred by cleaning product ) , and a nearly brand new Ikea futon frame(raw wood , no cushions ) to get rid of if anyone is interested .

I saw another human being today ! It's been a while ..... 
< PROPMALE > Giraldo dies of OD . He was the best . The 2 best comics die in the same month . How sad . I guess the earthworms are the ones that get the last laugh . 
Peace comes when religion goes .
