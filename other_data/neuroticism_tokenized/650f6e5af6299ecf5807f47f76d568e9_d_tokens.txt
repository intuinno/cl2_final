So random question for you facebook people at 2 am in the morning ( I know , perfect timing right :p ) , what do you think it is about the wine world that makes them so prevalant on twitter ? i've tried using twitter to follow and get response in other fields i'm interested in and i get nothing all that useful in return . but i mention one thing about wine and i gain 2 to 3 more twitter followers on average . 
I feel so much better now that I'm completely moved out of my old apartment and into my new one . Just need to throw up some posters . 
For the first time in a long time I'm going to cook tonight . It will be awesome . 
And I also picked a greek wine from specs to go with the meal from their mind blowing selection of 5 greek wines :p . 
okay i'm an idiot , apparently i bought a wine earlier thinking it was greek and it turns out it was german ... all i had to do was turn ... 
... the bottle around and see where it was from . 
I hate to prop up microsoft office too much , but their one note app is really good . if you haven't tried it yet do so it'll help so much . 
Wow that work out was awesome , I need to really get back into this hard core again . Get back to where I should be . 
I just had an awesome work out at aerofit ... going to give it a 3 day trial but I'm not sure I'll sign up because the bag area sucks .
