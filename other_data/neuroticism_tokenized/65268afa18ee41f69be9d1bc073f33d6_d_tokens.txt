~ Daring to risk is an essential step to self empowerment . This is the key to breaking out of stuck thinking and behavior . It is about breaking through the comfort zones and barriers . It is about experiencing new levels of mind and feelings . It is about experiencing more life . ~ 
I'm going to be happy . I'm going to smile a lot . I'm going to count my blessings . I'm going to look for reasons to feel good . I'm going to remember positive things from the past . I'm going to look for positive things in the future . It is my natural state to be a happy person . It's natural for me to love and to laugh . It's natural for me to dance and sing . I am a blessed person ! The universe loves me and you !

~ See yourself as the great person you really are . A being of light since the day you were born . A person who was already a perfect and amazing creation of the universe . ~ 
Humans think that they are superior to nature , and so , they seek to subdue it . In doing this , they destroy the very habitat which was created to protect them and to be their paradise . \

Colorado Is Beautiful ! 
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY ... Nothing others do is because of you . What others say and do is a projection of their own reality , their own dream . When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others , you won't be the victim of needless suffering - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Ruiz ( The Four Agreements ) 
There is no such thing as a neutral thought . Every thought takes us into love or into fear , and whichever one we choose casts out the vision of the other . ~ Marianne Williamson ~ 
Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch Life was meant to be happy . Do you believe that ? If you don't , then life will have no choice but to play itself out according to your non-belief . Don't be surprised if you are unhappy more of the time than you would wish . Yet if you believe that life was meant to be happy , it will be .

The soul intuitively seeks the perfect circumstance and situation now needed to heal wrong thought and bring you the rightful experience of Who You Really Are . The soul understands what the mind cannot conceive . Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch 
Who You Are Shows Up Bigger In What You Do Than In What You Say ! 
Describe me in ONE word , using the THIRD letter of you're name . This is fun . Answer me and then copy as you're status and see what people say about you . 
You are the embodiment of the information you choose to accept and act upon . To change your circumstances you need to change your thinking and subsequent actions . -Adlin Sinclair

Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch Be the builder of bridges . Close the gaps that have formed between religions , between cultures , between races , and between nations . Join together what has been put asunder . Namaste 
Allow your deepest truths to be altered . Be OPEN . Don't close off the possibility of new truth because you have been comfortable with an old one . Life begins at the end of your comfort zone . Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch 
100 friends or more on your facebook ??..... but when you need them , how many are there for you ? If you'll be here for me click \Like\ " then copy & paste this on your status like I have just done and see how many true friends you have " 
As long as you are worried about what others think of you , you are owned by them . Only when you require no approval from outside yourself can you own yourself , And truly be yourself . Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch 
Colorado Colorfest ! How Beautiful !! 
Kindness , compassion and service . These are three incredible sources of knowledge , happiness and prosperity . 
We Truly Empower Ourselves By What We Think and Speak 
Love Is The Answer !!! 
A life lived by choice is a life of conscious action . A life lived by < PROPMALE > is a life of unconscious reaction . So are you at choice or < PROPMALE > ? in action or reaction ? 
Stick to your beliefs , if that serves you . Hold tight . Do not waiver . For your ideas about \right\ " and \ " wrong\ " are your definitions of Who You Are . Yet do not require that others define themselves according to your terms . Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch " 
Thanks to < PROPMALE > Willden for sending me Yellow butterfly . I really like it ! http://apps.facebook.com/thinking-of-yo-cbbje/home?url=&tv3=mKjWaWAcGOaVwDWCKSrAhyuGk060bBS6bKs%3D

I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and I fell in love some more . You were only a minute old , I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of yo ... ur body . Put this status if you have children that you love more than life itself 
Please keep Dr. Cain from < PROPMALE > in your prayers , He has stage 4 lung cancer . Thank You !!!
