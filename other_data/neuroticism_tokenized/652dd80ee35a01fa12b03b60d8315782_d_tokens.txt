Careful , your apathy is showing . :/ 
Today was so much better ... :] BUT WHO THE HELL plans an orchestra/band concert on the same day as a Shinedown concert ?! I could have went to Shinedown if it hadn't been for the dumbass concert . >.< 
\fuck is the word of the day . so is the phrase \ " I'm fine\ " . I'm so fucking fine ... "

Tiger noises are sexy . :D 
Hey , I have a question for everyone . Is it alright to be insanely inappropiate on my facebook statuses ? or are your parents lurking behind you reading over your shoulder .. this is something id like to know for future reference . 
I confused < PROPMALE > with < PROPFIRST > . * face palm * well , imma go die of shame now ... xD 
Having the power to rip up or delete texts , viocemails , pictures messages , and notes is having the power to delete whole memories . Good .

I realize the book makes errors , but am I supposed to automatically question everything in the book or just magically know what's wrong in it ? I'm going to show it to her tomorrow and if she gets mad idgaf because I AM RIGHT . D:

Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day . (: Now this is just my opinion ( and I think I'd say the same thing whether or not I was in a relationship , idk ) but I think < PROPFIRST>'s Day is about more than celebrating being in a relationship . It's about love . And as you should know , there's all different kinds of love , all of which can be celebrated on this day . :] 
humiliating experiences FTL . errghh . >.< 
If you're not going to rec night and have NO other plans , then you should def go to Rock ' N Bowl and be ghetto with me , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPMALE > . (:

I just saw Shutter Island . It was the best movie I've seen in a while . I wouldn't watch it if you can't handle gore and whatnot . 
After reading all these facebook updates ... I am entirely amused . Thank you . (: 
This may seem an entirely disgusting question but I was doing research the genocide in Darfur . And it said that this man raped this woman repeatedly but was also calling her a dog and other such animals . So , if he thinks that this woman is an animal , isn't he like .. enacting bestiality ? at least in his mind ? wow that's sick .. 
me&Quinn = superbadasses . :D 
Communications project has screwed me completely . I just finished the book . xD

rawr I want new friends . >.< 
:D <-- that's all I have to say 
This has pretty much been the weirdest spring break ever . :p 
And I feel a weakness coming on . Never felt so good to be so wrong . Had my heart on lockdown . And then you turned me around . I'm feeling like a new born child . Every time I get a < PROPMALE > to see you smile . It's not complicated . I was so jaded . 
If the point's to never disappoint you somebody's got to tell me what to do . I just wish you could have seen me , when it used to come so easy . I'd like to say that it's easy to stay , but it's not for me , because I'm barely here at all . Just slow down now , the secret's out . And I swear now I can make this perfect . <3 
Today was a good day . I was laughing and smiling most of it . Thanks to everyone responsible for this . :D 
Thank you Mr. Mall Cop for escorting us off the premesis . We have trouble opening doors . :D 
Losing an earring makes me want to murder things . Especially when you have the other pretty earring to remind you of what you don't have anymore . Sounds like a metaphor for something . o.O

It's weird when you're at the park walking , then there's a group of 5 or 6 teenage boys , and one starts staring at you . Then another . Then they turn away , say something to the other boys , and then they all start staring at you . D: wtf ??

I've met people these last 3 years that won't be forgotten . Yes , this is an ending , but another beginning as well .

Me and < PROPFIRST > were walkin around her hood a couple hours ago on our way to < PROPMALE > , and what do we see ?! A guy , with a mask it looked like , a grown man nonetheless , dancing freakishly in the front year of this house . and the house had lights on it and tribal music in the background and weirdish Native American yells . THERE WAS SOME FREAKY SHIT PARTY GOIN DOWN . Needless to say we turned and walked the other way .

I love my mood being entirely based on someone else's reaction to me . I love being self conscious and acting socially challenged because of it . I'm going to go crawl into a corner now because I love corners . WAIT A SECOND , can't do that , I have to study for quarter exams . I love quarter exams . And I love my life . The End . 
Well today sucked . Except from about 5:20 to 6:30 pm . ;) 
Text me to distract me from studying ? yes ? (: 
< PROPMALE > Mann , \Circle ' a ' if you would like to continue buying oxygen\ " -- lmao " 
I managed to put off studying for every single one of my exams this week . I feel as though this is an accomplishment in itself . Football game tonight . (: wow , what an absolutely cliche thing to say ..

seems hazy . I'm a real wild child !

There's always something going on at Boylan Catholic High School . It's Week Against Pornography ! Needless to say , I AM PUMPED !

Okay kids , so my birthday is in 10 days . I wanted you guys to know so you were all completely prepared . Mentally and physically . Also , I'm updating the piece of ____ my phone is , so tell me what kind of cellular device for verizon wireless you think I should ask for . kthanxbai . :) 
A Night at the Roxbury is making my week . <3 
I'm reading the puns on punoftheday.com . I'm on extreme amusement overload . 
Make next week a better one . >.> 
Song recommendations please ? :) 
And\ 
maybe we're all broken into three parts : Our past , present , and future\ 
selves . Each piece has the risk or potential to mix in with one or the\ 
other . 
\I was having the best dream ; I met the perfect guy ... and then I turned into a big black guy . \ " LOL . "

Jimmy : .. so you're going to stab me 66 times ? Me : Not unless I had a spell to bring you back to life . Jimmy : Aww , thats so sweet . LOL . 
He hurt his arm by yes-ing too hard . (: 
Sooo ... who might be going to the Auburn vs Boylan game tomorrow ? 
I think the day's about to get a lot better . (: ? 
\It's called the horizontal monster mash . \ " \ " No ! It's called the vertical monster mash and the horizontal tango ! \ " \ " .. but then it's just a regular monster mash . \ " \ " Fine . Then it's a vertical tango and a horizontal monster mash . \ " \ " ... then it's just a regular tango . \ " \ " Oh . \ " :D " 
We haven't thought of all possible options . I can succeed ... only this time faliure is the goal . :p 
I'll do the number thing :P send the # to my inbox . you probably know what to do . 
625,600 -- I'll always know you as the most desired girl in middle school . But it's really not hard to figure out why . You're sooo pretty , extremely charismatic , and you're just fun to be around . (: ? 
420 -- Really , < PROPFEMALE > ? 420 ? (: I've loved watching you grow up . In 6th-7th grade , all the changes were a bit overwhelming , but I've seen you mature and learn from a lot of ur mistakes . A long time ago , it used to be just me giving you advice . Then it was u giving me advice . & finally , we've gotten to the stage where we can < PROPFEMALE > completely on each other for support . I don't know what I'd do without u . Much love -- <3 
1029384756 -- You drove me crazy last year . You should know that . Howevvver , I'm glad we talked about every little thing . Clarified everything . And all that good stuff . You made a huge impact on my life . And I may eventually forget the stairs by the mall and the penguins , but I definitely won't forget you . And I'll definitely always care about you . :p 
25 ? -I think that was the number I was supposed to use . :p Alright , I have to say , you've grown on me . You're actually fun to be around . You're ultra mega intelligent . Your facial expressions are the best thing ever . I wonder if we started talking last year if anything would have been different ; i wonder if we would have been friends . :p Also , you can be mean , but I forgive you .. sort of . ;) 
51245673899902748908769696969832- U are friggin perfect for me . You are extremely sweet , & I shouldn't tease you quite so much . :D You are so adorable . And very funny . We started out as musical soul mates . Inside jokes = the best ( Plan B ;) . I trust u almost entirely which is more than I can say for people I've known 3x as long . I get to be w/my best friend all day & I never get sick of u . 100% on the project ! HELL YES . 
6969- You're a pretty cute kid . (: I rarely see you , but it's really fun to < PROPFEMALE > out with you . It was hilarious that day at the mall , you get a text message from a certain some and you thought he was watching you and you were busted . LOL . That was a fun day . We should < PROPFEMALE > out sometime again . :p 
\Be safe . Drugs not hugs . \ " I love you < PROPFIRST > Cofield xD " 
911 -- I ' only met you this year , but I already consider you one of my best friends . Your laugh is amazing . You are so so so pretty . Our conversations are hilarious . That intense look you give me right before we hug is a huge turn on . ;) I think I could tell you a lot without any judgment . You're very open and you have a lot of great qualities . I'm super glad we have lunch together . (: ily <3 
For those of you who think that writing papers is pointless , you are incorrect . You are taught something that will apply to the rest of your life . And that , my friend , is the < PROPMALE > of complete and utter bullshit . 
I finished my english paper . Following that event I said \well .. it's not as bad as it could have been\ " . Now I sleep ... JUST KIDDING . Now I have to do my lab report and study for French/Religion . Thank God tomorrow is the last day I'll have to think for 2 weeks . " 
You taste good . You taste .. better than McDonalds . lmao . 
It's been a good month . <3 
Adam : Can you hand me my spiffy new phone ? Me : Yeah sure -takes phone- Oh , there's a message from God . It says you're going to end up alone and depressed . NAH IM JOSHIN . No one sent you a message . Adam : Wow , that was a double slam .. 
Not a fan of waking up sick on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > . Oh well . -sinffle sniffle- haha . Happy Holidays (: 
The sadness when people who are supposed to be your best friends stop making plans with you and you never get to see them ? dammit . >.> 
I counted . I've had 7 really good days so far over break . And they all had something in common . (: 
I practiced piano and guitar today . Did my math . Did a couple chores . More productive than anyone thought someone waking up at 2 in the afternoon could do ... 
< PROPFIRST > was just hacked by her best friend . < 3 (: 
Cult 45 . 2 zigzags . Baby , thats all we need . (: 
I think I've been overly active on facebook today . o.o 
I want someone provacative and talkative . Her bone structure screams TOUCH HER touch her . She's got the curse of curves . (: CIWWAF . <3 
Me : Hey < PROPFIRST > , guess what I just discovered . If you pucker your lips and while trying to say the word kiss , it makes a whistling noise ! < PROPFIRST > : .. get out . -comes backa few minutes later- Me : Aren't you a little old to be playing video games ? < PROPFIRST > : Aren't you a little .. stupid ! oh my family . :) 
People need to stop talking about finals , and how finals are stressing them out . BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE STRESSING ME OUT . Stay chill . >.> 
I got picked up by < PROPFIRST > Smith . :D 
You're always trying to keep it real , and I'm in love with how you feel . I don't see what anyone could see in anyone else , but you . Juno <3 
I always felt a little superior in the sense that I was a scorpio . And now they tell me I'm a libra . I'm not sure how I feel about this . 
I am so glad I got to go to school today unlike you losers .. pshh ..... 
Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before . \ 
I know I'll often stop and think about them . \ 
In my life , I love you more . 
< PROPFEMALE > Montgomery misses me . She just doesn't know it yet . 
Is it a good idea to join the softball team @Boylan when u lack athletic ability like hardcore ? U've never been good at a sport . U've never been on a softball team . Ur improvement @best will go from 0-1 . U practice some Saturdays&practice spring break . Ur not really sure if you'll even have fun . u know u'll be the worst person on the team ? ( this is true ) . IDK . I feel like it might be a good experience .. ugh . help ?

I'm mean and irritable when I don't get enough sleep . I never get enough sleep . 
Was home sick . And this is not going to be a good weekend . : l 
I have a problem with pressing on a website that was supposed to tell me the definition of torque and getting a website with a list of links to Asian dating websites . 
While so many love quotes are incredibly sweet , I feel like the one that most applies to me is , \Love is being stupid together . \ " ~ Paul < PROPFEMALE > " 
< PROPFIRST > Mann : \You have beautiful eyes . I can see my reflection in them . \ " lmao . xD " 
< PROPFIRST > Mann is insanity on the dance floor . whoamann . You wish your boyfriend could break dance and know every single lyric to ' Love Shack ' . <3 
I have such a raging clue right now ! 
I don't think my father , the inventor of Toaster Strudel , would be too pleased to hear about this . 
So I was watching ' Waiting For Superman ' . Apparently American kids come in last in math proficientcy as far as developed countries go , but when kids were asked whether they thought they were good at math or not , American kids came in first . HA . Congratulations to us , we're cocky a-holes . (: 
You would think a day where you got to see nudity in english class would be an amazing day , but this has been a very . long . day . D: 
Help me believe its not the real me . <3 
It's only mildly embarrassing when you're grandma , at church , loudly whispers that she thinks the priest has learning disabilities . o.o 
So I need ten+ characteristics and ten+ things associated with me for my health project due tomorrow . People who know me ... any ideas ? Be nice . ( : 
< PROPFIRST > Didier : If the bread in communion is consuming Christ , how much of the bread do you have to eat to consume a whole Jesus ? LMFAO . Great nice with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Vader , and < PROPFIRST > Mann . <3 
Why is it that every time I write a sentence for my history paper , I go back on facebook , logout , and preeat the process ? This might explain the fact that I only have the first paragraph done . >.>

Dear Friends , if at any time you tried to im me , and I did not im back , it is because i am only logged in on my phone . My phone does not notify me . So I am not purposely ignoring you , my phone , ironically called a smart phone , is just challenged . kthanxbai .
