\ ... knowing something to be true and living something that is true are twoseparate things ; to just know leaves a gap where you may still fall to pastexperiences . But lived knowledge is not so easily forgotten and rarely ill applied . \ " ( from a story Im working on ) " 
He says , your looking for < PROPFIRST > then , he will be out with you in a minute . \ 
So the man I asked for < PROPMALE > comes over , ( i thought to tell me he will be right over ) and introduces himself as < PROPFIRST > .... so akward .... \ 
He didnt mind though and we talked for a minute but since he was busy he gave me his card and said he would call when it died down and if not for me to call him by tomorow . 
.... ok ... so my mom got me in with the owner of Dewz for an interveiw and gives me the wrong name . So when I go in I talk to a man and ask for \steve\ " they say he's in the back and if I was sure I didn't mean < PROPFIRST > I said yes . So < PROPMALE > comes out and I stand up and shake his hand and I mention my mother had me come in to interveiw with him for a possition . "
