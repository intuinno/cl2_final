yesterday at lunch a friend persuaded me to jump into an unattended shopping cart we found on campus . i fell out of it three times . the intelligent ones reading this will note that this means i climbed INTO the basket twice after falling . the brusies ( which look like a hickie to my mother ) were defanately worth the fun :) this moment was only missing < PROPFIRST > spain to pick me up and grace waddle to laugh down upon me <3 
it'd be really cool if my floor was black marble that reflected the stars i wish were on my celing , and all of it was bathed in a beautifully soft blue light .

OMG \

but there was a hopscotch board on the ground\ 
i played on it ^^\ 
everything else was scary as crap , but i had my < PROPMALE > bear boyfriend to hide behind :) 
don't you just love it when someone says the sweetest thing ever and you ruin everything because you're not sure how you're supposed to respond to such a compliment ? \ 
well , only when it's worth the compliment :)
