So , I'm walking my dogs this morning and a police officer stops to tell me my dog is beautiful . He proceeds to let me know that we will see a lot more of them in the neighborhood because crime has risen drastically in the last month in our area . He tells me to make sure to keep my doors locked even when I am at home ! Thank god we are moving to Webb City in less than 2 weeks ! 
Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes . This will be my last year in my 20's so I better make the most of it ! Next year I look forward to being a hot 30 year old LOLOL ! Love you all . :)

A part of me misses you sometimes but then the other parts slap that part around . 
Right now a vet tech is helping a < PROPFEMALE > become a mother , is holding the paw of a dying dog , is inserting an IV into a kitten , is listening to an owner tell a story and is missing their pets while caring for yours . Vet techs save lives . Re-post if you are a vet tech or appreciate one . 
Just finishes my first day volunteering at the Animal Shelter . Boy is it hard work . Got to walk a dog , then bath 2 and walk them , then folded a bunch of laundry .

He was such a sweet dog just needed a little training and some love . "
