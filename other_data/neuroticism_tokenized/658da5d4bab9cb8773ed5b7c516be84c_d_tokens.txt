I'm a geek if the best thing that happened all week is rolling an 18 on a D20 with a +4 mod to critical hit and kill a zombie necromancer . And your a geek if you understand what I just said . 

Had my first lesson of my second form of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
Soon summer will be gone , and with it the sun . Then like a vampire I'll creep back out from my dark dank tomb and enjoy the winter rain without fear of a permanent sub-dermal tan . Until then I'll hide , only to come out at night to converse with night owls 
Moved on to painting a bright ugly toy chest a cool gray green . Now the music is Pet Shop Boys . 
I'm sorting though my Magic : The Gathering cards . I haven't played in 7 months , but I will Thursday . I've been playing that dang game for 14 years now . 
Still cleaning the house . Funny that cleaning is such a dirty job . 
On the 4th I'm going to try to shoot 2000 photos . Then I'll have a week at the beach to shoot many more . I'll post the best few when I can . 
Time for the 4th fun to start . Highland parade at 9 am from palm to central . BBQ at gramps place . Redlands University Firework show to finish it off . If your there come find me , I'm usually on the north end near the track . 
My goal for the 4th was to take 2,000 photographs . I missed the < PROPFIRST > at a mere 1805 . I'll try again next year . Wow I'm wiped , how is it that having fun is such hard work ? 
Three days of vacation down , four days to go . 
Just woke up from 3 weird dreams . One I was visiting a family member who claimed to live in a castle and no one believed her . The second I met a family of superheroes and was kidnapped along with them by a supervillian that didn't believe that I had no p

Getting ready to go dancing tonight . 
Back from the YSA dance . Three and a half hours , I didn't miss a single song , and dances with some lovely ladies . The crowed was smaller , but almost everyone was dancing . I wish they all were that good .

Repeat of my earlier question : Question for the NPW Is the RF Museum trip still scheduled for this Saturday , the15th . If so , are they still leaving at 10am from the NPB ? 
Listening to some steel drum music to wake up this morning . 
Waiting at school for my first class to start in 6 hours . 
I'm listening to some Haitian rap , Indian reggae , and Canadian folk music . 
Listening to the RM soundtrack . 
Ladies , don’t play hard to get , it just confuses us men . If your interested , let us know . Men , man up and ask her out already . 
Counting down to the ' mormon superbowl ' i.e. General Conference . 
Half time is over , now for more ' momon superbowl ' - LDS 178th Semi annual General Conference . 
I don't mind having an extra three days off of school , What I don't like is that it's doctors orders . 
You make a living by what you earn . You earn a life by what you give . 
Goin out dancin tonight , and if I'm lucky , I'll be out dancin tonight too . 
Back from the dance , now to update my facebook and eat cottage cheese & jello . 
\Open rebuke is better than secret love . \ " --- Proverbs 27:5 " 
For me , the party starts hours before I arive . Taking a long hot shower , getting my cloths just right , drinking some Kava and Yurba Mata , psycing my self up by listening to the opposite music of that will be played that night , dancing around my room with the black light on . Getting ready to go out is sometimes the most fun . Two hours to go to party time ! 
Back from the dance , it was cool , mostly 80's music played so I actaully knew the songs . Great night . 
Just finished 12 hours of working on a chistmass party at church , set up , break down , and taking 1000+ photos . Why is having fun such hard work ? 
bbbrrrrr ,,,, tttryingg toop type withh glovvsssss onn ..... 
I have the option of A : Going to a weding reception . B : Going to a game night at a friends house . C : going to an UFC fight party at another friends house . D: Going to see my dad sing with the Inland Master Corel . Which did I choose , E : Staying home alone studying for a math final . =-(

Any one at SBVC have a recent Math 102 book ? 
First day of math class . Even if I find a used book it's going to cost me $70+ just to do my homework . Theres a code that's only good for one semester for online materials . Those evil text book publishers strike again ! 
1st homework assignment for math 102 . 119 questions . Probably 100 on 2 . Plus a practice test , all due before class tomorow , when I get to take a test . YEAH ! 
Rain , Hail , Thunder , Lighting , Wind , tornado watch , flood watch , and threats of power outages . And I still have to do homework and go to school tonight . 
Now the lights are flikering . I think I need to shut down the computer , ... but I still have homework to do ! 
Have you ever used the lighted screen on a gameboy to read a book in a dark room ? Or is it just me ? 
It’s raining here in California . People complain when the temp hits 60 and don’t know how to handle rain . It makes me miss my days in Portland Oregon As a LDS missionary . I’ve been remembering my missionary days a lot lately . 
I’m in a slump , a personal recession ; I search and search for something to no avail . I’ve tried around town , different cities , even round the college . A few looked promising , but their not looking for anyone right now . I try to make myself marketable , so potential benefactors will accept me . Still no luck . 
Starting the count down to the dance tonight . I hope it's a good one . 
Back from the dance , I'm physicaly wiped but mentally psyced . I can never sleep after a good dance or concert . Everyone that wanted to have fun did have fun . Why do some people refuse to have fun ? Next up , the hockey game on Saturday . 
If you and I woke up in jail together , using only FOUR words , what would you say to me ? Copy and paste this in your status to see what funny things your friends have to say . 
I’ve been trying to describe how I’ve been feeling lately . One description is like walking into the wrong classroom at school , rushing out embarrassed , only to realize it was the right classroom , and being embarrassed again as you take your seat .

How was my day ? Well , witnessed a bad accident right in front of me , called 911 , I was first on the scene , provided what assistance I could , and gave my statements to the police . Typical day . Some things I realize , drunkenness on TV is not funny , car crashes in movies are not exciting , splatter films aren’t realistic , ketchup is not appetizing , and reality has no background music .
