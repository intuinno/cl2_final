I'm a little surprised since an oil spill is not only MORE likely than the gulf , but would be considerably worse , and would be much more difficult to clean up . I like our country's priorities . Happy 4th ! 
That was the most interesting game of Risk I've ever played :)

I think I love Lady GaGa more than is socially acceptable . 
Quick summary of today : I got plates for my car . Some crazy bitch on drugs yelled at me for the price of our hotdogs being too high . I thoroughly enjoyed watching < PROPMALE > Byrne with < PROPMALE > , which of course came with a side of our antics . Also , garden carrots are delicious ! 
This crazy ear piercing cavalcade must come to an end .

Taco time ! 
How about instead of being against illegal immigration , you make immigration easy and legal ? Maybe instead of discriminating against Latinos , you could make them a part of < PROPFEMALE > . Isn't that what we're all about ? Being white is all about being worldly . I mean , none of your ancestors were born here . Get over yourself . 
Dear random stranger who yelled at me as you were driving by tonight , \ 
It flattered me to know that you would still \TAP THAT ASS !!! \ " even after < PROPMALE > bumped my newly pierced ear so hard it was bleeding all over my hands . I don't think you knew I was covered in dried blood . But thank you anyway . " 
Does anyone else watch Shop Erotic late at night with their significant other ? Just for fun ?

I went to < PROPMALE>'s Wings today . The guy who took my order was waaaay too friendly . Before we left , I realized I forgot to get my blue cheese . I went up to the counter . He waved to me from across the room and ran over to me . He went to get the sauce . I turned to < PROPMALE > and Corissa and said , \I bet his number is going to be in the bag . \ " So we get home . Guess what's in the bottom of the bag ! I left the number with Corissa . " 
It's too < PROPFEMALE > out !
