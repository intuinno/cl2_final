Happy 4th ! 
That was the most interesting game of Risk I've ever played :)

Quick summary of today : I got plates for my car . Some crazy bitch on drugs yelled at me for the price of our hotdogs being too high . I thoroughly enjoyed watching < PROPMALE > Byrne with < PROPMALE > , which of course came with a side of our antics . Also , garden carrots are delicious ! 
This crazy ear piercing cavalcade must come to an end .

Taco time ! 
How about instead of being against illegal immigration , you make immigration easy and legal ? Maybe instead of discriminating against Latinos , you could make them a part of < PROPFEMALE > . Isn't that what we're all about ? Being white is all about being worldly . I mean , none of your ancestors were born here . Get over yourself . 
Dear random stranger who yelled at me as you were driving by tonight , \ 
It flattered me to know that you would still \TAP THAT ASS !!! \ " even after < PROPMALE > bumped my newly pierced ear so hard it was bleeding all over my hands . I don't think you knew I was covered in dried blood . But thank you anyway . "

I went to < PROPMALE>'s Wings today . The guy who took my order was waaaay too friendly . Before we left , I realized I forgot to get my blue cheese . I went up to the counter .
