Holy Crap I just remembered that tomorrow is < PROPFIRST > and I's anniversary and he'll be at the Vikings game ! Oh Well ! :-) 

Chillaxin , had a pretty darn good weekend and already done with work this week . Time to read my books . 
i'm feeling really tired today . 
mentally preparing to spend the whole next week with my sister , the new baby and my other 2 nieces ......... 
so facebook reminded me that i haven't logged in in awhile . * eye roll * i've been sick since the beginning of the month , swine flu , almost all better now . 
Sulky cause I missed pretty much all of October ( my fave month ) and didn't get to partake in the activities I wanted . 
Enjoying November . 
I am officially only going grocery shopping at 1am on Tuesday nights ! Bleh , so many people out shopping every place we went today ! 
Figuring out Xmas gifts ............ 
doing some online xmas shopping , goodbye money goodbye 
Having a happy lazy bday . Thanks for the Hap-Birt notes ! <3 
* knocking on wood * cause i'm feeling damn good about life lately ! 
I realized today that I have not driven a car let alone MY car in 2 1/2 months . 
putting off digging through the storage closet to find my wrapping paper and bows . :-/ must wrap tonight ... 
Made some cookies ! 
Cleaning up a little , < PROPFEMALE > is coming in just a few days ! FUN ! 
Gonna pick up < PROPFEMALE > in the morning !! Yay ! A visitor ! 
Happy New Years Everyone ! 2011 is coming up soon and it looks good to me . :-) 
how's this happen ? the one night it's acceptable for me to sleep until 10 or later and i wake up at 6am ! guess i'm just excited for the new year . :-) 
I do not get Kidz Bop at all . How is it appropriate if children sing adult songs ? They're STILL adult songs . If you're gonna let them sing California Gurls why not just turn on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? 
gar ! apartment hunting has made my head hurt . i am soooo tired and i just get more tired thinking of having to pack everything and haul it to the new place ....... 
? (?????) ? Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness ...... 93% won't Copy and Paste this , will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
bored ..... 
:-( I hate when my < PROPFEMALE > has to go out of town overnight for work . It's lonely . 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status . Put the first entry for your name under comments 
The weather outside is frightfuil .............. 
I'm extremely < PROPFEMALE > der caffinated and starting to get a little stir crazy from being cooped < PROPFEMALE > indoors . 
I miss the weekend ...... I like when my < PROPFEMALE > is home . 
Ugh , packing is no fun , especially when it's items you rarely use but you just can't seem to let go of . Excited for the new place though ! 
If you have a wonderful husband , fiancé or boyfriend that works hard to provide for you and would do anything just for you and your family , then repost this as your status to give the honest well behaved men out there the recognition that they deserve . Because great men are few and far between , and I have one of them ? 
All I want to do is absolutely nothing ! 
Is it strange that I need childproof locks on my cabinets and closet doors so the cat can't open them ? 
Damn Home Depot , I was all excited because they had the vacuum filter I needed . So I go back to get it and it's gone ! NONE left ! And I preemptively threw the old one out already . 
Mmmmmm Coffee , is that you calling my name ? Why , Yes , Yes it is ! 
I would have rather just had a shot of Patrón Silver than this Sencha Shot ! ( japanese green tea ) Bleh . 
If you receive something that says ' Send this to everyone you know ' , pretend you don't know me . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
The one thing that makes Easter < PROPFEMALE > trump Halloween < PROPFEMALE > is : Cadbury Eggs . I could eat those all day ! Yum ! 
:-( My car needed a new battery today . I guess I can't complain the battery that was in it was the original from when I bought the car , so lasting 8 years isn't so bad . I'm just sad , it's the first < PROPMALE > thing I have had to do since the warranty ran out . what do I have to look forward to fixing next ? * knocks on wood * 
Suck it Home Depot ! I found my vacuum filter @ the grocery store , and it was cheaper ! 
One moment can change everything . Whether the moment feels significant at the time or not . And then you're on this new path that's not part of the plan . You can't control that it has happened you just have to go along for the outcome . Good or Bad . 
I almost went bananas on some person cause I thought they stole my laundry basket ! Good thing I kept calm , I left the basket in the apt , not the laundry room . :-) 
I know better than to have coffee after 9pm and yet I do it anyways . So here I am unable to sleep . My eyes want to sleep but everything else says no . 
Soft < PROPFEMALE > , warm < PROPFEMALE > Little ball of fur Happy < PROPFEMALE > , sleepy < PROPFEMALE > Purr , purr , purr 
ATTN : < PROPFEMALE > area friends , my friend < PROPFEMALE > is looking for a sitter for tonight , and a sitter long term . If you're interested or know someone who is , please pass along your/their name ! Thanks ! < PROPFEMALE > - Is anyone available to watch < PROPFEMALE > tonight from 2-10ish ? Looking for last minute babysitter !

Happy Easter ! Hope everyone has fun ! 
What a ho-hum day 
you illinois people better stop bragging about your cool thunder storms !!!! i want a storm * pouts * 
How many of you personally know all the people on your friend list ? Well here's a task for you ... I want everyone on my friend list to comment on this status stating how we met . I mean our first encounter ever . Then repost this a your own status and see what results you get . Fun to read some history :) ( Thanks < PROPFEMALE >!) 
Ok I admit it I'm a bitch !!!! Unfortunately most women won't repost this ... I make mistakes , I'm out of control , I'm emotional , and at times I'm hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best ! If you're a bitch repost this ! I dare you !!! 
I should have just stayed in bed today ! My eyes are barely staying open . 
Why is it that I can barely keep my eyes open during the day but I cannot fall asleep at night ? My internal clock is scrambled and cannot make up it's mind ! 
Yesterday I wanted to listen to some music during the afternoon to make some time go fast , by the time i was done making the playlist it had 220 songs , and no time to listne to it ! it was time for dinner . :-) But it gave me something to listen to today ! 
Ok , time to try that sleep thing again ! 
I was inspired to get chinese food last night , :-) my fortune cookie said : You are a lover of words someday you will write a book . 
yawn , Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > . 
Time for dinner , and to decide between watching House or How I met your mother ! 
YAY ! Finally a thunderstorm ! Just laying here and enjoying it . 
If you have no will to change it , you have no right to criticize it . - Anonymous ( from my quote of the day calendar ) 
Arrggghhh ! 2 days , 4 phone < PROPFIRST > , 1 email , 2 live chats and 6+ people and I finally have my Qwest Internet issue resolved . Bleh .

I've got a case of the Mondays . :-/ 
People who live upstairs , you are on my ever lasting gob stopping nerves . Stomp , stomp , stomp , is it really neccessary everyday ? everyday ? really ? 
I just drank a boatload of coffee in not a boatload of time , what was I thinking ?!! 
the omnious music from < PROPMALE > Koopas castle is stuck in my head di di di dida ??? No clue how to write it out 
Does anybody else worry about the effects of microwaving your food , like years from now ? 
I love Spring ! Warm enough during the day for ice cream and still cool enough at night for hot chocolate ! :-) 
So I don't want to be premature about this * knocks on wood * but according to this acceptance letter I am officially a COLLEGE GIRL now ! :-/ 
All these posts about watching \The Hills\ " - YUCK ! Ewwww ! :-) ~ " 
Really loving having a dishwasher this week !!!

Grrrrr , facebook why are you being so difficult today ? I just wanna upload my squirrel video and you won't let me !!! 
A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve . - < PROPFIRST > Joubert 
Dang it !! the squirrel video was the first one i uploaded and it's not showing up !! GRRRRRR ! 
i made fudge for the first time ! yum ! just waiting for it to cool down ! 
Grrrr math is on my nerves already and im just reviewing for the course placement test . bleh ! 
I just had a weird thought . I was thinking about the sea lions at Fishermans Wharf in San < PROPFEMALE > and trying to see if they had come back ...... Maybe they left cause they know something . Like how animals leave before natural disasters ...... Maybe something is going on below the water ...... 
OH , i'm sooo sad now , I just realized my coffee shipment was on hold so now it won't be here for even longer . What am I gonna do ??? Go to the store ? Yuck ! 
Is it sad that I really love the \Swagger Wagon\ " ( sienna se ) Ads ? :-) " 
I hope to never have to wake up this early ever ever again . :-/ 
That just made my night ! Me , \Sweet and Innocent looking\ " :-) lol " 
Ewwww , it might snow tomorrow night ! Why Mother Nature Why ?

You dont tug on Supermans cape You dont spit into the wind You dont pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger And you dont mess around with < PROPMALE > !!! 
Such a fun weekend i have no voice !! 
Finally home !! time to rest now 
After 3 nights in a row of only 5 hours sleep each it feels so great to have gotten 12+ hours ! 
Bleh , time to recoup on the couch with < PROPFIRST > . 
Heat WAVE ! Bleh , was in the 40's then shot to the 60's for two days , now in the high 70's I need time to adjust ! Yuck , I hate being hot .

Hmmmm , trying to decide what new phone I would like to have ....... Kin Two , Motorola Devour , HTC Hero , Droid Incredible ............... Ugh , I dunno . 
I <3 being able to pick up right where you left off with your coolest friends ! No matter how many days , weeks , months , or years go by without seeing each other ( or even talking ! ) it's still just like it was . :-) 
What's with all this banana talk today ??? 
* Insert ALOT of bad words * our ceiling is leaking !!! Thanks upstairs neighbors . 
It's Peanut Butter Jelly Time ! 
OH MY GOODNESS !! Today sucks . Sucks . Sucks . Sucks . The ceiling is leaking AGAIN !! They never did come and replace the light fixture but I guess that's a good thing now . Although i've been up since 1/4 to 6 this morning ! GRRRRRRR . And Financial Aid is being a thorn in my side . I'm heading for a mental meltdown , in 3 ... 2 .... BOOM 
All by myself for the next 48 hours ..... :-( well < PROPFIRST>'s still here . 
Well if i'm gonna be home alone , at least I can watch Twilight in peace . :-)

All alone again tonight . Waiting for din din to get done and then i'm gonna watch New < PROPFEMALE > ! Yay ! 
Every time I've done something that doesn't feel right , it's ended up not being right . - < PROPFIRST > Cuomo 
Getting excited for next month !! Start my summer classes , 12 credits , gonna be BUSY , and then home to visit ! Yay ! 
Hmmm , laundry , dishes , vacuuming , take out recyclables , make cookies ... ALL DONE ! I was kinda productive today , despite 99 bottles of rum on the wall ..... 
Wow , I actually slept good . I think it's because this financial aid headache is taken care of . :-) 
Rising with the sun is getting old fast .... The fact that i've already been up for hours makes me not happy . 
MMMkay , ordered my new phone today . I was all set to go for the HTC Ozone , but after reading the reviews , and then rethinking what i'm really gonna do with my phone ( pretty basic shite ) I went with the KIN two . And it was about $100 cheaper than the ozone or imagio ( second choice ) . We'll see how it goes . It comes tomorrow ! 
Shower time !! such a lazy morning . 
WTH , First as a kid you can't wait for school to let out for summer , but as an adult you scoop up all the summer classes you can . Second , my summer classes are going to be harder than my fall classes . Go figure . 
Cake Decorating Class in 45 minutes !!! :-) 
Ready for bed , what a busy weekend . I'm sleeping in tomorrow ! 
It's a rainy day , and i'm loving it ! 
Loud kid outside singing repeatedly : < PROPFIRST > & Chicken Noodle Soup Are The SAME ! 
Gots to go to my advising & registration session now ! ( for school ) 3-4 hours they say it takes , yuck ! 
I'm tired , ready for bed . Going out in the world takes alot outta me .

Oh sleep why must you elude me ? :-( 
Today is a HOT one ! ( like 7 inches from the midday sun .... sorry couldn't help it ) 
So I was thinking about this last night , and Tempur Pedic should make a couch . That's my opinion . 
When my heart is open to you and your heart is closed to me , don't get mad when the connection you're wanting isn't happening . It's a two way street , bucko ! 
SON OF A @ ! **#% i go to check the laundry and what does < PROPFIRST > do while i'm gone for 2 minutes ? Spills my very FULL glass of water , EVERYWHERE ! 
picked up my container store order and got some chinese food . :-) what more could make me happy tonight ! 
A good friendship is often more important than a passionate romance . -tonights fortune cookie

Week one of classes , coming to a close . 12 credits , 5 weeks , 1 me . What was I thinking ? 
Visit home = canceled . New phone = returned . 4 classes of homework = me sooo tired .

Trust your own instinct . Your mistakes might as well be your own , instead of someone else's . - < PROPFIRST > Wilder 
Super tired still . My brain is fried . 3 more weeks to go yet .

Some people take the initiative to make things happen , while others just let things happen to them . So if you're just sitting around waiting to see how things play out , don't be surprised if it doesn't go the way you wanted . Don't wait to see what happens next , MAKE things happen . 
Oh , WOW ! I've just been looking at everyone's flood pictures , holy moly ! I hope things get better and drier soon ! 
I've been watching this person for years , using self sabotage with such finesse . SMH the biggest phobia out there is being afraid of your own hapiness . 
I freaking need lasik ! I'm tired of getting in the shower and finding a spider in with me ! Little jerk wouldn't drown either ! 
I like my sugar with coffe & cream . ;-) <3 
Freeport and Rockford peeps , do you or your parents remember a store in Northe Towne called Weise's ??? OR remember House of Lindberg fine furniture ?? Any info on this ??? 
Son of a Biscuit !! How did I run out of coffee and NOT notice ?? 
Grrrrrrrrrrrr , F*@% Me . I'm all patting myself on the back , thinking i'm all caught up with my assignments and then TA-DAH ! NOPE found my list I made and I forgot a few things I need to accomplish yet . I'm thinking an all nighter might be in order . :-/ 
Oh Darn You room darkening curtains !! I slept in much later than I intended and i'm still bumming around yet .

The last thing I want to do is hurt you . But its still on the list . 
Were my book bags always this heavy ? I am not looking forward to lugging this thing around tomorrow . :-/ 
well so far i fell up the stairs and sat down in the right room but wrong class . i just want to go home 
Ha ha ! My neurosis has a silver lining !

I'm so going to sleep in tomorrow , homework be damned ! ?

It's chilly in here ! Time for socks !!? 
Oh this will be interesting . We bought a shark steam cleaner thing like on the TV and < PROPFIRST > is attempting to use it now ...... :-) 
The amount of compliments I have gotten has tipped the scales ! The red hair stays ! :-) I'll have to \keep it up\ " this time around .? " 
My eyes are telling me that homework is not meant to be done in the middle of the night . ( Yes this IS the middle of the night for me ! ) 
Time for bed ! Way past the normal bedtime !! 
* Knock on Wood * I think the upstairs neighbors are moving out !!!!!!!

Hooray October ! The happiest month of the year !?

I was rudely awoken at the time I requested ( 6am ) and then given false excitement by misleading statements . :-( My sleep deprived mind thought somehow I had missed my favorite day of the year , the \fall back\ " time change and I had an extra hour to sleep . Not the case !? " 
Sleeping in tomorrow ( this ) morning ! Don't F*ing wake me up either !? 
Mmmmmm apples from the apple orchard ! the new \hot\ " apple to have is the Sweet Tango . Yum ! "

They\ 
say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking \ 
& never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like\ 
\ 
they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how \ 
faraway they live , & they don't hold grudges . They understand that \ 
life is busy but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at \ 
least 1 of these friends . You know who you are .? 
Who wants to help me with my research paper ?? :-) Topic : Kids going hungry in the summer during the break from school because they don't get lunch . Two solution proposals , which do you like best ?? A meals on wheels summer solution-kids on wheels type of thing OR a day camp type of thing at the school during summer .? 
I wish I had some more peanut butter oreos right now . :-( ?

Damn procrastination and laundry .... another late homework night this will be . :-/ ? 
Saw the fam yesterday , ate some food ( sorry Tom ! ) , beat EVERYBODY at bowling , played some hide-n-dark tag with the kids , chatted , and drove home in freezing drizzle . All the excitement I need for the month in one day ! 
huh , go figure 3 1/2 hours of sleep wasn't enough to get me through the day . Time for a nap ! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ? 
That was a really weak nap . I am going to be very unproductive the rest of this evening , which means I will HAVE to be very very productive tomorrow !? 
Holy Moly ! It's 10 degrees outside right now and with windchill it's -4 ! I think I need to move .? 
Oooooohhhhhh the temperature has made it up to 19 degrees now . LOL what a big improvement ! What's it like for you < PROPFEMALE > Heinrich ? Lucky ! 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone ! Yum Yum don't eat too much ! :-)

Today I am thankful for DISHWASHERS ! :-) ? 
I'm gonna go crazy ! ( okay crazier is probably more accurate ) Ugh !!! 
:-( yuck yuck yuck . I've been sick since last weekend and I thought it was getting better and today i'm coughing like a smoker . ewwwww 
Bleh .? 
Being myself includes taking risks with myself , taking risks on new behavior , trying new ways of being myself , so that I can see how it is I want to be . 
Just like anything else in the universe it always gets worse before it gets better ! The last two days were the worst of my sick week , but I think it's slightly better today . :-) ? 
Man after almost 27 years I think it may be time to part ways with my tonsils .... UGH ! Not feeling so hot right now .. :-( ( Hudsons fault ! ) 
Ahhh December , you took forever to get here and yet you've come too fast .? 
tick tock , tick tock .... 
So I am just throwing this out there ... I really really really really really want a roomba .? 
:-) With all the happy's being thrown my way today , I AM happy happy happy ! 
Alright , even though I made fun of it ( in my head at least ) i'm doing the # game I guess . yadda yadda yadda , send me a # to my inbox and i'll post a status with my thoughts ... 
#286 - Crazy girl ! A little\ 
ghetto .. but I still like ya ! Youre\ 
smart and can go places if you just apply yourself ! Definitely had fun working with you , I may have\ 
tweaked the schedule sometimes so I could work with my favorites . LOL 
#1208 - Hmmm , were a lot alike , \ 
even after so much time . I have a lot of great childhood memories and glad that\ 
we are now able to make some more memories together ! LOL you are a bit stubborn\ 
sometimes and competitive and you dont like to lose ! But youre super awesome\ 
anyways ! 
#13 - where to start ? One of my closest friends , although\ 
lately it hasnt felt like that . I always have fun with you and I imagine you\ 
will always be a part of my life . ;-) \ 
Sometimes I dont think you give yourself enough credit or do whats\ 
best but youve done pretty good for yourself so far . You work hard and play\ 
hard . LOL 
#222 - Lazy ! lazy lazy lazy , and hilarious . Always a good time . Stubborn and prideful to a fault . But your head is starting to finally look at things the right way . Oh and you're kind of an uncle f@#&er ! 
* An amendment * ONE NIGHT ONLY-inbox now or forever hold your # ( i only have so much < PROPFEMALE > ) Alright , \ 
even though I made fun of it ( in my head at least ) i'm doing the # game\ 
I guess . yadda yadda yadda , send me a # to my inbox and i'll post a\ 
status with my thoughts ...? 
#33 - You're one of the few really good guys I know . You do your own thing and you've always been super nice . I don't think I ever heard you really raise your voice or say something bad behind someone's back . You're pretty cool , I think we got along well . You let me drive your car for about 5 minutes , LOL , thanks for the attempt at a lesson ! And thanks for the happy bday . :-) 
#7237 - You are wild ! and sometimes vicious when angry . But you are honest and upfront with your feelings , nothing wrong with that . LOL You're fun to be around and have always been nice to me . :-) I remember you letting me wear your pretty dress for my spring pictures ! :-) 
#083 - We had our share of fun , nerdy fun , LOL . But they were good times , even if we had no hot water ... You didn't look down on me . We started to bump heads a little after being literally together 24/7 and I started to get jealous/territorial but aside from that I have nothing but good memories of you . I see that you're doing pretty well for yourself now and that's nothing but what you deserve . :-) 
Decisions , decisions . Stay up and work on homework or go to bed and get up early to work on homework ? neither sounds appealing , I am sick of homework , 5 more days to go ! 
#27 - Oh boy , what to say about you ? Ummm first how dare you tell me what to talk about ! If I want to mention dead trannies I will be the one to decide that ! LOL Even though you're kind of a jerk sometimes , you're kinda a sweetheart too . I miss my day old valentines < PROPFEMALE > ! You're smart and amusing and that's why you're my friend . Now if you would stop being a bum ! ;-) 
I think it's a little messed up that I am really excited for next Wednesday when all my classes will be finished and I can * GASP * do some < PROPMALE > cleaning I have been neglecting . 
#419 - Well dang I've known you half my life now , that's crazy . I'm glad to see time has toned down some of your bad habits . ;-) Really impressed with the father you stepped up to be despite all the bad ones that surround us . I've had a lot of fun times with you and some not so fun ones , but in the grand scheme of things you never really did anything too bad . ( I hope I didn't either ) 
0731- :-) Temper , temper , LOL . Even though your driving makes me sick , you're still pretty cool and nice . You're a good mommy and a good person for a not so good person if ya know what I mean ? Really I think you should just take that pillow and do what I suggested with it . I'm excited for our next visit ! Wheeeeee ! 
Why do I do this to myself ? Ugh , at least this is the last night I will spend staying up writing papers , next semester I will be much better about not procrastinating . 
The sky is going to open up and unload a boatload of snow around me , I think I will be staying inside all weekend . 
Blizzard warning ! That seals it I am not going anywhere today ! 
As long as you love me so , let it snow let it snow let it snow ! 
Wow ! Plows have been pulled off the road until 2am because it is so bad out there ! Yikes ! 
Baby it's cold outside ! .... Well today with windchill it's -20 , absurd ! And looks like our neighboring town got 21 inches of snow but we got around 15 ourselves . Glad I don't live in Shakopee ! 
Uh oh . Let the snow wars begin ... < PROPFIRST > just stopped watching the packer game ( not like he's missing much ) to go shovel out his car after seeing the car next to him shoveling out their car and put the snow in front of < PROPFIRST > s .... after he already shoveled most of it yesterday . He's not happy ! 
Hmmm , I just realized some faulty thinking on my part , finished most of my xmas shopping online , i'll have to go to the mall for a few people yet but all my stuff should arrive by friday which means , i'm gonna be stuck wrapping everything last minute . i dunno if i even have wrapping paper ... do you think grocery bags count ? i could color them ... 
So tired . * Yawn * 
hot cocoa then a nap ? or a nap then hot cocoa ? 
W00T ! done done done . Hooray ! No more school stuff til January ! ... now I have to start cleaning the apartment . later , I'll do that later . :-D 
I may not be as young as I used to be , but I am not nearly as old as I think I am either . 
I guess that answers that , < PROPFEMALE > kat instincts take over . I opened the patio door to throw out some peanuts , < PROPFIRST > steps out to enjoy the snow , squirrel comes up the stairs , cat chases squirrel down the stairs , < PROPFEMALE > chases cat , arrrrggghhh , and i only had my slippers on . :-/ 
Guess who's sissy got her a squirrel feeder for xmas !!!! :-D Thanks sissy ! :-)

Official grades aren't back for the semester yet but it looks like once again I got 3 A's and a B . I can live with that . :-) 
Big plans for the morning . Wrapping all these presents ! I am formally requesting my family members to refrain from making any additions for a while , between birthdays and xmas I can't afford anymore kids ! :-) 
Happy ! Took our money jug ( which wasn't even a 1/4 full ) to cash it in , and we had a $100 in change in that thing ! That's waaaaaay more than I was hoping for . Drinking money , hell yeah ! 
Well I have places to go and people to see this week , I'll be away from my precious laptop so I most likely won't get to check in often or at all before xmas , sooooo < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS everyone , hope y'all have a great holiday week ! 
At suds ! Where are you ? 
One more day ... < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas my dearests , Happy Holidays and all that jazz too . <3 you bunches ! :-) safe driving to those hitting the roads tomorrow . 
It's nice to be home again but the sucky part about being gone for a week ... I need to do some grocery shopping and shoveling ... oh well 
I am so excited to clean off my desk tomorrow and put all my crap into the file cabinet we brought home . :-) 
Is it just sad or just a < PROPFEMALE > thing that I have two weeks off to do nothing and all I want to do is sleep ? * yawn * 
As much as I love getting my 10 hours of sleep ( it's a necessity ) I can not get into the habit of waking up at 10am like I have been for the past few days . :-/ 
I actually wish it was gonna be freezing temps out this week ... this warm up for the next few days has me worried i'm gonna have a lake in my dining room . :-/ 
I'm always humbled by all that I have because I know that it could be worse , yet I am always striving and hopeful because I know it can be so much better . 
I am 10 seconds away from buying an inflatable pool and just setting that shit up in the dining room . DAMN LEAKS ! 
Good News- We get a credit on our rent for January and each month there after until this leak problem is fixed . Bad News- This leak problem may not be fixed until Spring . :-/ 
Knock on wood , so far so good today , the leaking has stopped momentarily ( thank you freezing temps ) , laundry is done , and about to go to a movie . :-) 
You know what I'm always excited about in January ? Getting our taxes done ! I'm weird I know . :-) 
\because you're the one that judges me the most and is the most critical of me\ " says the pot to the kettle .... " 
Nothing good happens after midnight . :-/ ( I mean we all saw gremlins right ? ) 
Getting organized for classes the past few days and I am already tired just looking through all the assignments ... Man Happy on Monday for school , dreading it by Thursday . :-/ Suck it up Dodson . 
Yay ! I finally went out in the cold to check the mail this week and I had a letter telling me because my GPA for last semester was good ( although sadly not as good as summer semester ) I made the Deans list AND should be expecting an invitation for the Phi Theta Kappa honor society . :-) 
I'll be glad to see some family tomorrow , but sad for the reason why . 
I'm tired and drained from yesterday . My eyes just want to stay closed . Kinda grumpy at the weather for not snowing until tomorrow now .... could have stayed to visit longer ... :-/ 
ahhh Monday you have arrived , I guess it's time to be productive and get started on reading some textbooks . :-p 
I am already done with all this freaking reading . Bleh , my eyes are < PROPFEMALE > tired . :-/ how many more years til i'm done with school ?? 
I'm reminded what my high school English teacher said , when asked a similar question : \Your paper should be like a lady's skirt : long enough to cover the subject but short enough to be interesting . \ " But that was in a different day and age . - My business teacher about the length of discussion posts . LMAO " 
Dang for someone who rarely makes actual phone calls I sure did go over my minutes this past billing cycle and theres still a few days left on it ! 
You know what really grinds my gears ? facebook . How dare you switch me to the new profile against my wishes ! I was not ready to make that commitment I liked the old profile , I was used to it . Now I gotta get used to this weird new one . Unhappy , not cool facebook ! Not cool . And that is what grinds my gears today . 
Oh psychology class , I can tell my nerves are gonna be shot before the semester is over already . People trying to sound \deep\ " goodness gracious . " 
Super sleepy . got up early to go return a book because the bookstore gave everyone the wrong book for my class . waited in a line for an hour . and now my eyes just want to shut . 
Shout out to Pink Kisses for being super generous and compassionate to my < PROPMALE > ! Thanks !

Great Googly Moogly ! I have some of the dullest textbooks to read this semester . 
I've been doing so good about getting up at the same time every morning , but I do my best work at night soooooo drinking this bottle of coke and staying up working on my assignment is gonna mess me all up I think . :-/ 
did my homework today , made my funny < PROPFEMALE > some cookies and got dinner started already ! I get an A+ today . :-) 
Starting right now I'm giving up those distractions and guilty pleasures that get in the way of my goals . done . finished . ended . kaput . over . :-) 
I think I need a drink . And buy \a drink\ " I mean several . " 
* Insert something : funny , intelligent , profound , bizarre , < PROPMALE > , interesting , etc . *

\think since we were kids there has only been a couple times ive seen u cry that wasnt drunk induced\ 
Hmmm haven't seen my squirrels for a couple days . Wonder if they think its just too darn cold ( and that i need to shovel the patio ) or if they have been eaten by a cat ? :-/ 
< PROPMALE > surveyed his surroundings and found no shadow , so an early spring it will be ! Hooray ! 
Is it Sunday yet ? 
I think I'm gonna begin the search for a new fur baby this weekend . :-) 
Oh , < PROPFEMALE > why must you wait til the last 24 hours to do homework ? Don't you know the SuperBowl is tomorrow ?!!

Home alone = nap time . 
And since I never have anywhere to go , Let it Snow Let it Snow Let it Snow !

I am not the fountain of information . Why is it that I can take the time to look at they syllabus or the news feed for the class to find out what I need to know but this person just can't seem to do that . She keeps asking me and I told her where to find the info and helped her out but I think by now she should know where to look . And it's not at me ! 
Is it spring break yet ? :-/ 
T.G.I.F.

I remembered why I dislike the month of March so much today , the months almost over before I remembered so I suppose that's progress ; but anyways hurry up April and get here . Please . 
100% on my Health quiz :-) and I have been very much on top of my homework this week , I might even be able to take a break all weekend . yay ! 
Wow , thanks phone for being a dum dum . I just got a boatload of texts , apparently I haven't been receiving them since at least March 10th .... I could send them , I don't know what's worse ; that I thought no one wanted to text me back or that it took me this long to notice I hadn't been getting texts ! :-/ 
Well Mr. < PROPMALE > Krueger made another appearance in my dreams . I suppose it would have to be him , he only comes when you sleep and I love me some sleep . -_- 
Yay ! Last assignment for this week submitted ! Homework free weekend ! Why on earth did I ever procrastinate before ??

You know what really grinds my gears ? Smokers who throw their cigarette butts anywhere they feel like . News Flash the world is NOT your ashtray , and neither is my porch .

Mmmkay ? 
Procrastination rears its head in strange ways . Cleaned the whole house but did not accomplish reading any of my chapters .... At least it was productive procrastination .

Hooray ! Took an at home cholesterol test and I'm well in the healthy range . :-) First time I ever tested it . 
Where's my head at today , ugh ?! 
I think it's time for bed . * yawn * 
Sooooo I heard a strange noise this morning and look out the window to see what the squirrels were up to and one poor little guy had gotten himself stuck upside down inside the feeder .... LOL he was trying to chew on the little window that lets the food come out . I opened it with a hanger and he took off like a rocket . * This is not April Fools , it's real *
