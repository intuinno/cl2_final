Going to Jacksonville for a week or so . 

just got a lil ' haircut . thinking about going red . 
Hell yeah ! 
Fuck you , you t-shirt neck-tie wearing motherfucker . 
Just went to the zoo . Surprised at how many fine bitches there are at zoos . 
Have you ever been ashamed and felt society try to keep you down ? I begin to watch things change and see them turn around . Turn around . They'll try to keep you down . Turn around , turn around , don't drag me down . 
I don't wanna know if you are lonely . Long live the Du !! 
I've been in love , but now I'm waiting . Don't ever want to worry about a thing . I sit at home and I wonder , will I rise or will I go under ... Let it be me ! If you're lonely , let it be me ! Your one and only . ------ Lmao . I'm homesick . 
Most people are disillusioned , and I don't relate to a damn word they say . 
Drove out to the white trash beach , on a brief vacation . I'd felt freer than I had in a long time . I wondered if it's cause you were gone . 
Thinking about getting a whale-o-pus tattooed on me . 
Outside another yellow < PROPFEMALE > punched a hole in the nighttime , yes . I climb through the window and down the street , shining like a new dime . 
I don't wanna know if you are lonely . Long live the Du ! 
So take me down the road , take me to the show . Something to believe in , no one else knows . Don't take me for granted . 
I love you < PROPFIRST > Lohan , I'm glad you're not in jail ! 
Put Katey < PROPFIRST > back on Sesame Street ! 
Screwed , blued , and tattooed . Going to sleep . 
Brother's off to work . I'm going to see an old friend today . 
To destroy mankind and all that it stands for . \ 
\ 
To live my life the way I want to . To do what I believe is right . To devour enemies and celebrate life with friends . To never give up even though it hurts . To fight the blackness inside . To walk alone . To go beyond . To look within . To give yourself . To love and to hate . 
Wow , interesting game . But the Daily Show's on now . Go Pats . 
Tired of facing the adversities that come with being fucking lazy . 
One more happy day . =] 
Necromantical screams , only you are deaf . Is there life beyond death ? 
You were tenderly afflicted , \ 
and frozen in your place , \ 
with your wonderful tears\ 
and the tortures you faced . \ 
But you wouldn't move anyway , \ 
not for anyone . 
Just woke up from a weirddd dream . 
Tell her I spent half of my youth sprawled on on the floor , bleeding out from those old wounds . I woulda gotten her a ride outta that town she despised . You remind her if she writes . 
The heavy hooves of injustice have trampled through our backs and made victims of us all once again , THERE IS ANOTHER FUCKING SAW MOVIE . NO !!! 
I woke up , and the ceiling was moving like a conveyer belt over my head . Gonna be a good day , tater . 
fuckstartyourface bitch . 
Take me down the road , take me to the show . I'm with you when you're born , you can take me when you die . But don't take me for granted . 
I can piss further than you can throw . 
I see footprints on my ceiling , I can't help this fucked up feeling . You ain't coming around no more . 
I just can't stay mad at myself . Yesterday's gone yo . 
On my way nails broke and fell , into the - wishing well , wishing well , wishing welllll . 
< PROPFEMALE > stinky . 
You cannot eat just one . 
A chill day after a few late nights is always good . 
\How can it be called rape if the chick is dead ? Talk about a victimless crime . \ " Squidbillies . Lmao . " 
Gonna read some more of Slapstick , drink some more Faygo , and call it a night . 
Just cuz you feel it , doesn't mean it's there .

Went job hunting . Doing it online now cuz the world is gay . 
Should be an interesting day . 
I take pain for a living pal . I'd pretty much bet on me at this point . 
Camping tonight . 
Quite an experience last night was . 
I like to feed on broken hearts , There ain't no taste like lovers falling apart . 
Venom radio and venom television , I'm afraid of everyone . But I don't have the drugs to sort it out . 
Ghetto skating . ' Tis whats up . 
Sorrow found me when I was young . Sorrow waited , sorrow won . Sorrow that put me on the pills . It's in my < PROPFEMALE > , it's in my milk . 
All this time I swore I'd never be like my old man . What the hell its time to face exactly who I am . HATE TO SEE ! 
It's one thing I never said - I'm truly happy in my heart and in my head . A lonely liver suspended in liquid . 
I sleepy . 
Whoaaa huh huh huh huh . Back to sleep . 
Fuck those Tea Partiers in Kentucky . 
I miss not living in Crestview . 
I still owe money to the money , to the money I owe . The floors are falling out from everybody I know . 
Headed to Whataburger with Yorkie . 
Venom radio and venom television . I'm afraid of everyone . 
Yeah . Homelife is a drag . Deadly like a plague .

Oh I'm a human fly , it's spelled F-L-Y . I say buzz-buzz-buzz , And it's just because . I'm a human fly , And I don't know why . I got ninety six tears in ninety six eyes .

I know that I had sworn , I'd never trust anyone again , but I didn't have to .... 
I live in a cocoon , opposite of Cancun . Where it is never < PROPFEMALE > , the dark side of the < PROPFEMALE > . 
And I find it kinda funny , I find it kinda sad . The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had . I find it hard to tell you , I find it hard to take . When people run in circles ...... 
Friday . 
Guess if I was simple in the mind everything would be fine . 
how i long to regress to the days before i took upon myself the obsession of this world . a day of innocence equating beauty , for tomorrow may fall and today is already gone . 
Waking up with all your shit missing from your house ..... Makes me wanna go right back to sleep . 
Trying to add skating to the list of things I'm beast at . 
Fuck yooouuuu and , Fuck her tooooo . 
Why am I being a douchebag ? You lied to my face . Stupid cunt . 
Home might scatter and fade , with time all things must change . The road might take its own course . But I'll attend , cuz Mama we're still your boys . 
I wanna fuck , I wanna fuck the dead . 
\So your new friends are pretty fuckin cool huh ? \ " Yeah . I made them myself . " 
It's heaven and hell here , which one will I live today ? 
Sorrow found me when I was young . Sorrow waited , sorrow won . Sorrow put me on the pills . It's in my < PROPFEMALE > , it's in my milk . I live in a city sorrow built . And I don't wanna get over you . =] 
It was a stupid argument , and a stupid fight . But the fact remains . We don't mix . 
Ready to fucking eat .

To do what I believe is right . \ 
To devour enemies and celebrate life with friends . \ 
To never give up even though it hurts . \ 
To fight the blackness inside . \ 
To walk alone . \ 
To go beyond . \

I will smack your face off your face . 
Everybody's shaking like the end of the world , and everybody's waitin on the end of the world . I ain't got a friend , baby , left in the world . Don't make me dance all night alone . 
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at . Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at . But now we'll never know , I won't be sad but in case I'll go there , Everyday , To make myself feel bad there's a < PROPMALE > I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do .

Faster than stars falling\ 
How can I tell you that I've failed ? \ 
Tell you I failed 
You can't make friends with your enemies . Nothing's ever forgotten , it's just human bloody nature . 
Fly low carrion crow , seize my body for the dead I owe . Fly low carrion crow , for the crimes I've seen no one else should know .

Support your local Rumblers . 
Sail a sad ship across the sea out to the edge of this world\ 
And I ain't coming back cuz I didn't leave nothin ' behind\ 
All the old crowd still hangs out imitating angels\ 
But I ain't found a halo here no matter how I tried\ 
And I tried 
is inferior and full of anxiety . 
so happy meshuggah is home . 
So what man wouldn't want her with that long black hair\ 
If I cut you up , maybe I can repair\ 
I'd bandage your wounds with the salt on my tongue\ 
And I'm the only one not here 
But in my heart , I'm the weary kind . \ 
Much too tired to drive . \ 
Though it's sad enough for tears . \ 
It's been try-fail-try for years . 
I can see my own breath in any given room of this house . 
An empty fate just means an even score . But the pain , it fills my head .....
