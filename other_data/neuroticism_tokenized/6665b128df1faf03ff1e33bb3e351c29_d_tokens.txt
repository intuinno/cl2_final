Listening to Blue by < PROPFEMALE > and mellowing out from the day . As good a way to start a new year and decade as any I suppose . 

wound up working four hours overtime yesterday after four hours of sleep the night before ; just woke from 10 hours of slumber , feeling great ! 
Went to work and it turns out I'm off today -- I have no excuse now not to clean my apartment . 
\Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay\ " is one of those rare instances where the sequel surpasses the original . " 
Is glad to relax after one hell of a week . 
Keep the night light on inside the birdhouse in your soul . 
56 degrees , soaring wind and fog and a warm jacket . A typical San < PROPFIRST > summer day ... 
Bummed because I slept through Sloshball ... 
Watching \Sixteen Candles\ " on Encore . A classic if there ever was one . " 
I'm two for two this weekend , watching the first \Vacation\ " film . < PROPMALE > speaks for itself . " 
I don't have to work again until Sunday , a friend is coming up from San < PROPMALE > tomorrow , the weather is great , got the headphones on with \Dreamboat Annie\ " playing . A good night indeed . " 
Work is done for the evening , time for a double whopper with cheese and today's Young and the Restless . A perfect close to a nice day . 
At the end of a very slow evening at work evidenced by all the FB quizzes I've taken tonight . 
The thunderstorm this morning was so cool , been a long time since I heard one . 
I have to admit I like a Black Eyed Peas song . Who would've thunk it ? 
Thanks everyone for all the great B'day wishes ! 
A fellow FB friend posted this regarding the boneheaded attempt to \de-liberalize\ " the bible by some fanatical right wing nut jobs : \ " The Bible said Jesus fed the poor . It should have said Jesus fed the < PROPMALE > and let the fishes and loaves trickle down to the poor . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Colbert on the rightwing's attempt to remove \ " liberal bias\ " from the Bible . " 
Finally ending a long week at work , I've grown tired of all the political commentary , time to get through a few more episodes of \Thirtysomething\ " Season One DVD's . Night all . " 
Playing DJ , like I'm back on KOPN . 
A cloudy , chilly , hungover mellow Sunday afternoon . 
I banged my knee on the Muni last week ; I'm still walking like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Love Indian summer in SF . 
I'm thankful the Bay Bridge closure doesn't really affect me . 
Got my H1N1 vaccine today ; come on flu , \f\ " with me ! " 
Forty minutes of work to go ... 
Thank you Veterans for my freedom . 
Listening to Sublime . So is the evening . 
The heart healthy diet will pick up again in < PROPMALE > tomorrow ; a triple whopper with cheese is calling me tonight ... 
Hard day at work eating turkey and pie and saving lives . 
Baba Booey ! 
\I Don't Know Where I Stand\ " by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . One of the most plaintive yet beautiful and true songs ever written . Check it out if you are so inclined from the \ " Clouds\ " album . " 
is in need of rejuvenation . 
I was complaining it was chilly outside at 58 degrees until I saw what was going on in Missouri ... stay warm . 
Gotta love the SF Public Library . The CD collection is better than any store I've been to since Tower closed . Today I got 10 , from Metallica's Kill ' em All to a < PROPFEMALE > Nyro restrospective to Lennon's Imagine to the Chili Pepper's Stadium Arcadia , all being ripped into my i tunes as I write . Thanks to the aforementioned I now have the music collection I always dreamed of . 
To make a $10.00 donation to the victims in Haiti , text 90999 to the American Red Cross . The charge will appear on your cell phone < PROPMALE > . 
A nurse at work who is young enough to be my daughter stared at me incredulously when I told her I couldn't name a Lady Gaga song . Am I an old fart or does the popular music these days suck ? I'd say a little of the former , a lot of the latter . 
I just bought a $17.00 ticket to see Avatar in Imax 3D on Saturday . I sure hope it's worth it . 
Rain and wind outside , three days of the Young and the Restless on the DVR ; I'm in for the evening . 
Listening to Jar of Flies and reflecting on the day . 
Moonlight feels right . 
And the county judge who held a grudge will search forever more , for the band on the run ... 
I'm going to my first ever super bowl party today . Not being a sports fan I'll have to root for the city I like the most . From what I remember of it , I wasn't terribly impressed with Indianapolis so Go Saints ! 
Listening to Automatic for the People by REM and forgot how incredible and moving an album it is . 
Met a nurse at work tonight who went to college at < PROPFIRST > Woods in Fulton , MO . Hard to believe anyone here would be able to find Fulton on a map let alone converse on the wonder and ambience of fine dining that was Gasper's . We both felt bad that it's gone now . That was real food , not this Cali tofu health crap . Meat and grease . The way God meant it to be . 
I keep being asked to change my profile picture to myself and my significant other for Valentines Day ; since I have no pictures of me and my right hand I'll leave my picture as it is . 
The weather channel lies , says it's 52 and foggy , feels like it's around 70 and < PROPFEMALE > . And of course I'm at work . 
There's comfort in melancholy , when there's no need to explain ; it's just as natural as the weather in this moody sky today ... 
\But we're never gonna survive unless we are a little bit crazy ... \"" 
A rainy Sunday at work . 
Happy Birthday Pebbles Flintstone , born 1963 . 
So Cheney was hospitalized with chest pains ... strange for someone with no heart . 
Didn't think much of the upcoming \Alice in Wonderland\ " even in 3D until I heard it was directed by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > with < PROPFIRST > Depp as the Mad Hatter . Sounds like a 3D IMAX show ... "

Okay , I've released some pent up anger , no more Primus quotes but tread lightly ... 
Looking forward to a visit today from my old roommate from Columbia , MO a thousand years ago to compare the ravages of time on our faces . 
I heard from < PROPMALE > my friend back home that Columbia , MO is getting a White Castle ; if only they'd built one 20 years ago when I lived there ... 
One of the greatest joys for me is 12:01 every other Wednesday morning when my paycheck is direct deposited . 
First time in a long time I've had the windows open at night . Welcome spring . 
Okay Rush , now it's time for you to keep up your end of your self-imposed bargain ...

Welcome Saturday . 
There must have been a wave of head injuries in the Bay Area today , I'm running around like someone's chasing me with a gun ... 
A patient's family member asked God to bless me today because he said I'd been so warm to his kin . I'm definitely touched by the sentiment . 
Cheeseburger in Paradise . Those days are gone within moderation . I got a wake up call tonight . 
Eep Opp , Ork Ah Ah . 
Everything's gonna be alright , rockabye . 
Just got back from Chinatown with a friend from work , a few beers and a cheeseburger later things are fine . 
< PROPFEMALE > Whitman , who may be a very nice lady , still sucks . 
Finally a day off for ... for laundry . 
Sitting on the 38 bus heading west on Geary admiring the beautiful day in this awesome city listening to < PROPFEMALE > sing Refuge of the roads . Laundry can wait .

At a 24 hour diner at Geary and < PROPMALE > , 4 ; 30 am and at least it's a cool waitress and interesting patrons . Good conversation over a double cheesevurger , baked potato and fries . 
Happy Earth Day ! 
Have a good day Earth ! 
A nice , < PROPFEMALE > , mellow day atop Hippie Hill with < PROPFEMALE > and her contemporaries . Cheers to < PROPFEMALE > Gate Park ! 
Got an unexpected day off on the warmest day of the year so far . Sometimes life is just good . 
Friends of < PROPFIRST > Michaels seem to be inundating the ICU today with SAH's . So glad I have some time off the next several days . 
Keep the night light on inside the birdhouse in your soul ... 
A beautiful yet chilly day in the city . 
Did something I haven't done in years , actually bought vegetables at the grocery store . It's a new me . 
Those familiar nasal tingles are getting me down , a cold is imminent . 
Dealing with a spring cold , definitely a bummer . Still it could be worse I suppose . 
RIP to one of the greats , Ms. < PROPFEMALE > Horne . 
In my haste to catch a bus after work last night I sprained a tendon in my left knee ; once again I'll be hobbling like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > for awhile . 
Sometimes , even with a bum leg life is still pure joy .. 
Leg update : it hurts like hell on stairs , otherwise a 4 on the pain scale . Time to see the doc for pharmaceuticals , the ibuprofen's not touching it . 
Still walking stiff-legged , but the pain isn't nearly as bad today ; definitely glad to be back at work ! 
Tomorrow May 21st will be the 29th anniversary of my graduating high school . Holy shit . 
My leg feels much better , off work today , an Anchor Steam and a rediscovering of \Fulfillingness First Finale\ " by < PROPFIRST > Wonder . A pleasant afternoon . " 
Many thanks to all of those who gave their lives for my many freedoms . 
\Let's do the Time Warp again ! \ " Come soon Saturday night ! " 
It's 8:19 pm and it's still light outside . Gotta love Daylight Savings Time .

A ridiculously beautiful and surprisingly warm day , for June in San < PROPFIRST > anyway , going for a haircut . Things are good . 
A pleasant but chilly 55 degree day . Summertime in San < PROPFIRST > . 
A good day . 
The older I get the more I realize there seems to be a happy medium for most things .

Got an unexpected but welcome day off today and it's a nice cool , almost warm day in SF and I'm inside on FB . Something's wrong here . 
Sitting outside at a BBQ in Oakland with friends eating good food . A nice time indeed . 
No , my first name ain't baby , it's < PROPFIRST > ; Mr. < PROPMALE > if you're nasty ... 
Enjoying a Widmer at a bar in the Castro doing an 80's night ; the bartender wasn't born when the current song , Hungry Like The Wolf came out . What the hell , I'm young at heart . 
I finally got around to watching the news and I learned there's a heatwave in the northeast . It's 57 here today . I don't miss heat and humidity . At all . To all in the northeast , stay cool .

Just synced my ipod to itunes ; on a 120 GB unit I have less than 3 gigs left . I do love my music . 
Like an idiot , I didn't wake up with my alarm and woke 20 minutes late to buy tickets to the Phish show , all three days of it , in Berkeley . When i got up hurriedly and ran to the computer , all the shows were sold out . At least , besides all their albums , I have Kansas City at the Sandstone , fourth row in 1999 . \A Picture of Nectar . \ " Yeah ! " 
Do people just go out dancing anymore ? 
Hoping for a mellow Sunday at work . 
is . 
is working very hard saving lives and updating Facebook . 
Having a good afternoon listening to KSHE 95 online from St. < PROPFIRST > . All that's missing is the White Castles . 
One of the things I love most about living in San < PROPFIRST > is the diversity of the population ; while riding the Muni and while working I hear practically every language imaginable , and I've had the pleasure of meeting and in some cases making friends with people from all over the world . San < PROPMALE > was nothing like this , not to mention Missouri . I must say I made a good choice by moving here . 
Way to go Judge < PROPMALE > , equality for all !

For the first time this summer it's actually 80 degrees here ! And I'm going .... to work . 
is feeling strangely fine . 
You call it corn . We call it maize . 
Judging from the number of posts I've shared on Facebook today , a very slow , mellow day at the office ...

I wish the best to anyone affected by the fire in San < PROPMALE > , and my condolences to the families of those that were lost . 
When it finally gets warm in the Bay Area , of course this will be the time I get a cold . 
I heard somewhere that fried chicken is good for the flu . I'm going to try it out . 
I'm all set , I bought the box of nicotine patches . My birthday gift to myself week after next . 
I speak , for the pompatus of love . 
< PROPFIRST > Jatho from high school is on my mind ... does anyone from Fulton know what happened to her ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Whitman is a despicable cow . Just thought I'd mention that . 
More cowbell . 
Another year older and hopefully a little wiser ... thanks everybody for the b'day wishes ! : hat : 
Many thanks for all the birthday wishes from the FB community and to the great nursing staff I work with , thanks for making this a great day for me ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Dukes , bikini on top .

Nothing like a cool , < PROPFEMALE > and mellow day off . : glasses :

Today would have been my Mom's 83rd birthday . Happy Birthday Mom , I miss you . 
A warm night in SF , definitely a rarity that I didn't need to wear a jacket home from work -- love Indian Summer ! 
Watching the most beautiful sunset over the Pacific right now from the 8th floor of the hospital . Definitely awe inspiring . 
Not withstanding her atrocious policies and personality , < PROPFIRST > Brown calling < PROPFEMALE > Whitman a whore is just about enough all by itself to get me to vote for him . 
Good morning world ! Okay , so it's 2 pm . One of the joys of having a day off . : blush : 
Just got off the bus at Haight and Ashbury and the driver sang the stop , actually quite well . I love this city . 
RIP < PROPMALE > Cunningham .

Happy Veterans Day all of you , thank you for protecting me ! 
The clock on my wall I've failed to change reads 8:09 pm , it's really 7:09 and it's dark outside . The extra hour of sleep was nice but standard time has it's drawbacks . 
An anomaly , I'm up before noon on a Saturday ; there's so much I can do , like ... laundry . 
Laundry's done and it's beautiful outside , time to hit the town ! : glasses : 
Feeling well rested and ready to go ... and for a Monday that's saying something . 
I'm loving the warm nights ! 
After watching the workmen put up the tree in Union Square the other day , this morning I heard Will the Farter and < PROPFEMALE > the Queefer perform a duet of \Silent Night\ " on < PROPMALE > Stern . The holiday season has arrived . " 
To my niece < PROPFEMALE > who would have been 40 today , Happy Birthday , I miss you .

Taking a tour on the Muni with no particular place to go , wound up at Fisherman's Wharf at In and Out . The planets are alligned today . 
Loving the thunderstorm ! 
I caught about ten minutes of the American Music Awards while at work tonight , and I heard some of the worst music ever , commercial and plastic to the core . I'll take the risk of sounding old , today's pop music sucks balls . Big , sloppy , musty balls . 
Happy Thanksgiving everybody ! And to my FB friends in other countries , if you can't find turkey , at least go to Mc < PROPFIRST>'s or KFC , as they're calling it now . Kentucky Fried Chicken . Colonel Sanders . 11 herbs and spices . < PROPFEMALE > .

Up at 2am after a long nap , eating leftover turkey . Thanksgiving rules !

It was raining hard in Frisco ... 
This will always be a sad day for me , < PROPFIRST > we miss you . 
Finally on the plane which was due to leave an hour and counting ago . At least the mood lighting and internet help . Virgin Air is cool . 
Hitting my old stomping grounds in San < PROPMALE > , almost like I never left , 11 years is a long time . 
On the Amtrak going up the coast to < PROPFIRST > Point , very mellow and taking it all in . 
83 degrees , shorts and a t-shirt on , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
After the planes , trains and cars it's good to be home ! 
Overstaffed at work , got a paid mental health day . Unions rule ! 
No need to talk it out , we know what it's all about ... 
Finally , sun ! 
I took a stroll down Haight Street today since the rain ended and it was cool and < PROPFEMALE > , and I was pleasantly surprised by all the vinyl record shops I encountered . Glad to see some , mostly nostalgia at this point , things still survive . Now to bring back the 8-track ... 
Happy Christmahannukwanzadan everybody !

I'm colder than I've ever been in SF and it's not even 7 o'clock yet . A night of many blankets awaits . 
Sitting here at work and just felt an earthquake ; a small one , but still an earthquake . My desk is sturdy , and believe me if we get a big one I'll be under it quickly . I'm not proud .
