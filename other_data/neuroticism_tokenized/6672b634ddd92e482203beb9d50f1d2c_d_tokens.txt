I'm so proud of 102.7 , they play electro late at night , kaskade , deadmau5 ! This makes me happy haha 
This whole not being able to sleep thing is getting really old . 
I think it's easier to believe in myself than it is to believe in other people .

Jamming to < PROPFEMALE > with my mama in the car , oh yeah very gangsta of her :D 
I see nachos in my future . 
I discovered something today with Demi Leach , that sitting backwards on the bus seats is way more comfortable !

Don't you hate when you wake up at an awkward hour and you can't fall back asleep ? I'm debating if I want cereal . Blllaaahhh . 
Why do some certain girls these days think they’re hot shit ? When in reality you’re kind of annoying ! just keep your mouth shut and we’ll be good . :]
