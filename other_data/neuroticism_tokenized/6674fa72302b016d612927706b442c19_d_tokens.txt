what domain are you on ? 
<3 <3 
hearts , stars and horse shoes , clovers and the < PROPFEMALE > , pots of gold and rainbows , and a red balloon ! 
makin home made tortillas mmm sigh <3 
The time has come , the walrus said .. To talk of many things ... Of shoes and ships and ceiling wax ... Of cabbages and kings .. And why the sea is boiling hot ... And whether pigs have wings ! 
Reposting ... While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Repost if you're against Domestic Violence 
If you see someone with out a smile ... Give them yours ! <3 
What's under your bed ? <3 
What are you afraid of ? <3 
Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar ? 
What is the meaning of life ? <3 
Finish the sentence .... When in doubt ___________ ! 
Who are you ? <3 
Finding things out about myself , and it makes me feel ... lighter <3 
... have i mentioned i hate moving ... sigh 
Wet soil cold against my skin , as the darkness engulfs me , I contemplate my fate . I notice just a hint of something ... a < PROPFEMALE > , a glimmer ... of hope . The stars peeking through the crack in the molded wood to reach me ... against all odds to reach me . Just a teasing taste of sweet clean air and a tear from the heavens moist on my cracked lips . Past the dank mildew and maggot stench I can barely smell it ... life ! 
sick and tired of being sick and tired :'( 
ugh my stomach hates me :( 
any of you who live near me got a truck and willing to help me move monday or tuesday ? 
Once again I journey into the sun , the sweat will bead on my brow , and I will face the strangers who think I am their slave ! Who think I am obligated to risk my livelihood for them , and that I personally have a vendetta against them . To feel the pressure of cold eyes watching me , evaluating if I am worth enough to them , to keep me around ... alas I am off to work ! 
OMG TGIF 
The world is filled with anger , and those who abuse the emotion , \ 
when it comes to face me , I put my brain in motion , I react not with my feelings , and use reasoning instead , for if I let my heart rule all , I would long since have been dead .... -Me Just Now , :P

Thunder Rolls , and the sweet scent before rain teases our senses , lowering our defenses . Some will hide and express gloom , but for me the night will bloom , tis a day with rain , that makes me smile , I'll cast off the pain and dance for a while ... 
? Where have all the good men gone , and where are all the gods , where's the street-wise Hercules , to fight the rising odds ? \ 
Isn't there a white Knight upon a fiery steed , late at night I toss and I turn , and dream of what I need ! ? 
Follow the path of glimmering lights , beneath the stars of night , twisting and turning , your senses burning , wandering the winding path , until you find the place at last , where only the blind and the wise , or innocent eyes , can perceive and with sanity leave ... -ME just now :) 
writing .... or ... trying to anyway ... oy 
sleepy bye time .... :) 
Why do people feed off of drama ? I can see wanting it as a form of entertainment in movies and television , but we get enough of it there , let it stay out of our lives . 
Dang I need a scanner ... so many things I would do if I had a scanner ... sigh I must sleep g'night 
OMG I hate my apartments so so so so soooooo much ! My stupid AC is leaking all over the hall I have to navigate around buckets and cups ! My tub is finally fixed but I still do not have a mail key and after a month and a half of \Oh we will get it to ya\ " they tell me I have to go to the post office with my lease to get one . OY " 
Why is it that the being is not nearly as difficult as the getting up and going ... hmm 
Hi Ho Hi Ho Its off to work we go , with razor blades and hand grenades hi ho hi ho hi ho .... \ 
hi ho hi ho later its back from work we'll go , with torn up guts , and razor cuts , hi ho hi ho hi ho 
Tired of waiting for Glee !!!!! I want more Glee :/ 
twisting turning the aching the burning , the tease and the taunt , you flirt and you flaunt , with the flickering flame , a dangerous game 
I feel icky :( 
Serenity 
Rinse & Repeat 
Thunder nearly gave me a heart attach lol and woke < PROPMALE > up from a dead sleep whoooeeee ... I love the rain :D 
I wish everything and everyone I knew would make up their minds ,, I am indecisive enough without all the mind changing ... sigh sweet dreams all ! 
Do like the cavemen do :\ 
When you don't have any shoes ... do like the cave men do ... \ 
walk on ! \ 
When you don't have a home ... do like the cave men do ... \ 
be strong ! \ 
When you don't have any wheels ... do like the cavemen do ... \ 
get creative ! \ 
When you don't have a purpose ... do like the cavemen do ... \ 
just live ! \ 
Never underestimate , the power of a kiss , \ 
Take away your arms and legs , \ 
but still you would have this ... \ 
The power to heal and mend , \ 
affection for a lover , or comfort for a friend ... \ 
The power to bend a mans will , \ 
and in some cases , the power to kill ... \ 
Too often we realize to late , \ 
how often we underestimate ... \ 
the power in those lips , \ 
the power of a Kiss ! \

running out the door on my way to work hope I make it on time ... sigh 
Home again Home again Jiggidy Jig 
We know , we honestly know the things we do are wrong , and yet we keep repeating them like a bad song , over and over , round and round , to this insanity we are bound ! 
When it feels like the hole world is coming down , and I can't take it anymore , the sky is falling , and I'm locked outside my door .... The rain comes down , to wash away my tears , the storm rolls on , just like my many fears . But he is my umbrella , and the one to hold me tight , he is my hero , my < PROPFEMALE > Knight ! 
I may not always like it , but at the end of the day , through all the ups and downs life has thrown my way , I have survived . 
Has life spit you out yet ? \ 
Really ? What color was it ? 
grrr 
Inspiration at last ! ............... writing ........ 
Which ever way the wind blows , who am I to think I can halt it , which ever way the water flows , who am I to think I can fight it , Some times you have to go with the flow , pray for the best , and < PROPFEMALE > on for dear life ! 
... 
Hope you had a happy Friday the 13th folks

So happy to be brunette again :) 
shiny sparkly distracting little bit , sweeping , creeping , away you slip , just out of reach , you taunt and you tease , blissfully floating where ever you please . Leading me down a wondrous path , but knowing the pleasantry will not last . Before I can blink , and the thoughts can sink , disaster strikes , like a thief in the night , smack I am dead , in my final silk bed , know this , your life be at risk , as ye follow a will-o-the-wisp ! 
got to play with < PROPMALE>'s Phantom mask on Friday was fun :) 
Gasoline tears and emotions of cellophane , set me on fire , it'll only ease the pain ... \ 
My skin is not stone , I shall bleed if you prick , My heart is not ice , but will melt in your fist ! \ 
If life is a dream in a dream , and reality isn't what it seems , and only lies can be seen , then wake me up before I scream ! 
Game Night woohoo time to relax and have fun maybe do some improv w00t 
had fun doing improv skits ... lol so much hehe best quote of the night , \have you ever pooped a squirrel ? \ " :D "

Every time I get sick it seems my singing voice changes , I am hoping it doesnt get worse as I get better :( 
When it feels like the whole dang worlds coming down , and I cant take it anymore , the sky is falling and I'm locked outside the door , the rain comes down , to wash away my tears , the storm rolls on , just like my many fears , but where is my umbrella , and the one to hold me tight , where is my hero , where is my < PROPFEMALE > Knight ? ... >>> 
I feel 10x better than last week lets hope it sticks when I head to work ! One more week getting up @ 4am and then I'm back to afternoons .... hmmm ... think I prefer mornings , but maybe I'll try for overnights ?...? dunno 
There's a time for love and a time for living . You take a < PROPMALE > and face the wind . An open road and a road that's hidden A brand new life around the bend . There were times when I lost a dream or two . Found the trail , and at the end was you . There's a path you take and a path untaken The choice is up to you my friend . Nights are long but you're on your way To a brand new life(x2 ) Brand new life around the bend .

Doesn't make much sense , does it ?? : Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'm in the 1% !! SO TRUE , !!!! 
Life could be a dream sweet heart

OKAY OKAY OKAY 
You can set your mind on fire , you can free your soul , you can walk the edge of wires and never be full . You can spit venom at your foes , and forget the ones you love , but until you learn acceptance it will never be enough . \ 
The bridges you've burned are ashes in the wind , the good deeds you've done are tainted with sins . Say what you want , life will go on , time will not stop for you ... for very long ! 
So ... now what ? 
Nice I just got a message that my \stories are Epic ! \ " how cool is that ? "
