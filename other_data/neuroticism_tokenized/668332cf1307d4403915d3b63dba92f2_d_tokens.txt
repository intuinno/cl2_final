roar . 
yey for eventful days . 
horror is about not being in control 
you'd think logic says waking up in the morning with all along the watchtower stuck in your head makes that a good day ... logic was such a liar . 
this summer's ending is starting to feel like a dream ... 
... something satisfying about a good view 
after all it was you\ 
that's the only explanation\ 
in your broken trains of thought\ 
you had it all so figured out\ 
you were wrong all along\ 
it's just faulty information 
maybe not today or the next day or the next day but you get used to it ... right ? 
these feelings make me remember why i wanted to go numb in the first place ... 
* humming the bass line for comedown by bush * 
... mind running a mile a minute ... 
i can't get started from the part where i left off yesterday/ \ 
shoulda spent my time a little wiser/\ 
i sat alone guilty as sin waiting for words to come/\ 
and outta of my head still maing sense to anyone/\ 
i can't seem to understand the reason/\ 
i have yet to translate any meaning besides/\ 
its not worth it to try/ \ 
get out ! 
Try to see it once my way \ 
\ 
Everything zen \ 
I don't think so 
im really liking the giants new acquisitions 
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you . 
duh nuh nuh 
... maybe black mesa ... haha fat < PROPMALE > ... 
this top 10 drum songs list is awesome 
its like whenever im on time ... i would be better off showing late 
yay for figuring out movies before there over . 
do i seem needy or something ? 
seems like a dream got me hypnotized 
To those of you who know me : am i extremely rational ? 
that drive was satisfying and the impromtu race didn't hurt :D 
Move\ 
Or watch the slow death of your way of life\ 
There's a science to fear\ 
It plagues my mind\ 
And it keeps us right here\ 
And it keeps us here 
not giving in to it ... 
shoutout to the halfway hero , < PROPMALE > manning 
where is my mind ? 
and today was going so well 
you tell me that you heard every sound there is and your bird can swing but you don't get me 
you tell me that you've heard ever sound there is and your bird can swing but you don't hear me ... you don't hear me 
giants defense needs to show up . 
damn giants o-line . 
time took way too long ... 
can you make it dissapear ? 
blah ! stupid economics 
I had a dream . Crazy dream . Anything I wanted to know , any place I needed to go 
Nothing like the lure of a satisfying drive to make a dead night live 
when did everyone start calling me leepert !? 
g men what the hell 
its everything\ 
everything you wanted\ 
but what we had got lost along the way\ 
everything you needed\ 
and i'm reaching out for all the things we lost along the way 
mission accomplished !!! 
my week just died ... 
:D 
yey for tornado watches in all the places you ' ll be today ... 
stupid 80 dollar chopin tickets 
hate waiting ... 
There is nothing like deciding things with a coin flip early in the morning ! 
i feel like high school all over again . 
did i just create the backdrop for an epic story in political science 
its never a bad idea to take some time off ... 
is not available due to : gameday ! 
now lets see if the g-men decide to play for a change 
g men D looked like it should tonight 
i'm a mess i confess i should just lay in the road 
Only in dreams\ 
We see what it means . \ 
Reach out our hands . \ 
Hold onto hers . \ 
But when we wake\ 
It's all been erased . \ 
And so it seems\ 
Only in dreams . 
the world's a rollercoaster and i am not strapped in \ 
maybe i should hold with car but my hands are busy in the air\ 
saying i wish you were here 
thank god for pretty places ... make that antsy angry feeling go away 
Call the ambulance\ 
I'm fading away\ 
I'm here overwhelmed\ 
And life in the shuffle\ 
I'll fall to the back\ 
Forever , ever stumbling down this path 
i don't want your blessing/\ 
i don't need caressing/\ 
if you find me guilty\ 
then i don't want your sentencing/\ 
i don't want your seasons/\ 
i don't need a reason/\ 
only want your pressure if its to stop the bleeding/\ 
we're flesh and blood ... 
is wondering what is actually at work here ... 
lets go gmen 
14-0 in the 1st . Way to not dissapoint . 
giants blowout ? yes please 
let me tell you one minute won't matter to the rest of your life 
i like storms 
wants to scream 
how do i always end up the bad guy ? 
accomplishments are transient\ 
they pull me in unremittingly\ 
just lasting this long , I feel relieved\ 
let repetition save me\ 
well don't call me by my full name\ 
all this is temporary\ 
it feels much better to know\ 
that you won't feel a thing 
is reaching for anything worth holding ... 
is hating the fact hell be in these situations till he dies . 
She gave you a lemon . she's so into you . 
well ... it feels better now 
I don't look back on anything that will feed me anxiety . \ 
I don't look back on anything soft and glittering . \ 
Nights alive and empty starts are your disguise . 
i see a blank notebook < PROPFEMALE > and its my life and there is nothing i can think to write- i'm not sensing anything 
omg !!!!! i injured < PROPFEMALE > . 
* raises glass * to the 8 hour stint 
is disgusted because of the info in the leaked US war documents 
browns over saints ? wow

WTH giants

why did my economics prof take 10 mins to do simple arithmetic 
kinda wish i had < PROPFEMALE > and a full tank right now ... 
is wondering where they are ... 3 weeks and no contact ... 
you think no one sees when you don't pretend ... 
its a crazy idea when i cant even consider it ... 
i should be doing what i believe , right ? 
is thinking this month is gonna be an eventful considering all the crap he knows is gonna happen ... * looks at you * * shoots a look at her * * looks in the mirror * ... least it ends with food and a good concert 
I was feeling kind of seasick , \ 
But the crowd called out for more . \ 
The room was humming harder , \ 
As the ceiling flew away . \ 
When we called out for another drink , \ 
The waiter brought a tray . 
really likes oldies 
thinks his friends wake up too early 
gmen out of the gate early 
Don’t let yourself down\ 
Don’t let yourself go\ 
Your last < PROPMALE > has arrived 
wondering what grabs people attention when looking at other people . you guys should tell me what makes a random person stick out to you ? avoid the obvious doing smething insane please ... 
being conceited is incredible . 
impromptu horror movie night ! 
Oh so many times since then I've read those words\ 
Just waiting to see you , can you see me ? 
* insert incredible drum solo here * 
that tingling feeling in your stomach when you are on the edge of control has got to be one of the best feelings in the world .... 
roar ! gameday ! 
eagles skins game is over ... ill watch the highlights on espn morrow ... which is pretty much every third eagles play 
In the long run we're all dead - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Keynes

;) 
C'mon you apes . You wanna live forever ? 
if i hear assassin again ... it'll be too soon 
G-men need to make sure they dont have the same fate as the skins 
date with < PROPFEMALE > , today ... she sure is a hard broad to track down . 
so this is what its like when it actually works ... 
city lights are so bright as we go sliding through 
... in a coldstone ? really ? 
Happy Thanksgiving world 
interesting way to dream . my subconcious likes messing with me 
you just a piece of cheese without the corners ... you ain't never gonna be a slice . 
Strudle ! 
lose control in increasing pace ... warped and bewitched is time erased 
flies in the vasoline we are/\ 
sometimes it blows my mind/\ 
keep getting stuck here all the time 
Thanks for the birthday wishes 
Round 2 ! You ready ? 
... to a 72 hour good mood * raises glass * 
You shine brighter ... then everyone . 
This is our last chance/\ 
This is our last dance/\ 
This is ourselves under pressure 
Am i the only one who thinks the < PROPFIRST > game is just an excuse for random people to come out of the woodwork ? 
jury duty is for squares 
here's to the realization it was always gonna end up this way * raises glass * 
So what if the grass ? is never greener\ 
Hoping today should taste much sweeter\ 
I don't wanna talk ( I don't wanna talk)\ 
( You wanna know what I'm gonna do ? ) I wanna taste you ( I don't wanna talk)\ 
The way you were wrapped in suspense\ 
Said it all , saying nothing at all\ 
The hope at the foot of my bed\ 
Said it all , saying nothing at all 
* whistles * 
Hear that ? That's the sound of contentment . 
did this hectic day disguise itself as having fun . 
its the illusion of progress 
feeling weird . 
should be a dirtbag . 
what a way to feel . 
is thouroughly disgusted . 
\What a horrible night to have a curse\ " - < PROPMALE > Belmont " 
waiting for true beauty ... the kind only nature can have ... 
merry/happy/joyous christmas to you and yours 
is maintaining his poise . 
roar . recovery . 
Oh yeah , all right Are you going to be in my dreams Tonight ? 
Falling out of existence . 
Shoutout to awesome insult fest < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > 
Here's to not living life vicariously . Maybe the rest of y'all will go outside to talk to people instead using Facebook
