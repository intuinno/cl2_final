best friends are hard to come by and for that i thank you both , < PROPFEMALE > Mia Grierson and < PROPFEMALE > Duncil . you both are my world . 
it's four thirty in the morning and i'm no where near sleeping . i find that the silence is somewhat suffocating me , and the cold is etching away at me . nights like this makes me almost near positive that i'm closer and closer to insanity . 
i've got a crush , on a youtube < PROPFEMALE > , it's a little bit much , ' cause you know who they are . 
am i the only one that hates the new facebook layout ? 
feeling like crap , lets talk ?

forget everything i said about you , sir . 
i've given up .. 
for once , i'm getting over you . i don't care , and i'm okay without you , even though i didn't have you in the first place . i'm okay . you're okay . i'm better off without you around anyways .

I wish getting you out of my head was as easy as pushing the delete button .

I've though I was < PROPMALE > Potter for the past few days , correction , I'm < PROPMALE > . Anyways ! I'm off to fix a nurses incompetent bandaging then spending some very good quality time with my parents , because they truely are my fricken heros . 
I just woke up on the couch , in a crappy position , needing my bandages changed . This is annoying . And yeah , Mama D was there to help but it still fricken sucked . I'm ready for this crap to be over . I don't enjoy this AT ALL . I feel like I'm gonna throw up now sooooo bye . 
So yesterday I found out some things : Doctors don't REALLY care , its the nurses who champ through ; what friends are and are not shady in my life .. that was pretty easy ; crab legs are amazing recovery food ; and that i missed a whole week of work which sucks ! Thanks though , ' cause some of you were the ones who helped me figure things out ! =] Tonight I would absolutely love to hobble to a movie , does anyone wanna go ? 
woke up in excrutiating pain . wanted to cry . took my meds , and now i feel sick . today is not gonna be a good day . i can alreadyyyyy tell ! 
went to Cici's with Mama D and bethy , and now I'm home recooperating . I hate that I'm worn out after going out for like .. three hours ? Ugh . Does someone wanna do something tonight ? 
my leg hurts , and my best friend < PROPFEMALE > Hopkins is leaving today for like six weeks . NO WIN . Sount down till Labor Day tho , right ? I don't feel good today , and I'm tryin ' not to tale my pain meds if I don't have to . Ughhh . 
You were having a great weekend and I ruined it ? I had a crappy week and you were the topping . Don't call me for anything , don't expect my help on ANYTHING . I'm done being your support and having you be nonexistent when I need support in the slightest . Screw off , later hater .
