Woot ! Can't wait to see my baby tomorrow ! Two weeks feels like forever !!! :-D :-D 
It pisses me off that people have 2 get all bent out of shape because some guy tries killing himself . Hes new maybe he misses his family maybe something else . Any1 ever think 2 just shut up and talk 2 the guy ? Be a friend 2 him ? I mean we're supposed 2 be a family but no one cares for any1 when they are feelin down . Maybe all he needs is sum1 to talk to him . If u have guard on him tonight be a man and be there 4 him . 
Had a VERY good night last night . Got to have dinner and go bowling with my babygirl ! Was sooo nice , missed her sooo much ! Love you sweetie ! mmwwaahh

Week 2 : Homework 9/11/10 8:32:13 Graded2/2Benjamin , Very thorough and detailed responses . Your last sentence states that not all people reach the Formal Operational level . According to a 2003 report on eductional psychology , only 35% of high school graduates in industrialized countries obtain formal operations . I found that very interesting . \ 
IM ON FIRE BABY ! TWO 100%'s!!! lol 
missing my love , can't wait till wednesday ! 
:( 
Yet another day in Hollywood . Goodnight Korea . 
I really want some cereal but I don't have any ... Or milk ... 
Went on a nice run off post this morning with the 1SGT . Thought I was going to die in the beginning of the run chest was in so much pain . Then after about 10 minutes it went away and I was feelin better . All in all I'd say we did 4 or 5 < PROPMALE > . Now I must .... poop ! 
So I'm looking for my contacts . My roommate and I recently rearranged our room and I'm still trying to find somethings . I remember him putting my contact solution in the cabinet above the sink . So I go to open it and comes flying off the wall and almost smacks me on top of my head . Thank god for fast reflexes . Anything else in this room want to break ??? 
I'm so angry . You see that ? I threw a broom ! Now what ? huh ? I'm so intimidating . Next time I'll throw the dustpan too just you wait and see ! grrr ! HAHAHAHAHA 
time for dinner and a movie and Z .... z ... Z ... z ... Z ... later world ! 
8 months in 2 days ! :) 
Wow . It's a small world after all . This kid who I used to be friends with when I was young and hadn't talked to since I moved away when I was 10 found me on facebook . And he's stationed here in Korea . Air Force but I'll forgive him for that one haha . 
Please put this on your status if you know , or are related to , someone killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that the Rebel Alliance is a band of murdering scum . The Empire wants only to bring peace to the galaxy but these rebels continue to kill our brave brothers in white ... 93% won't ... copy and paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? (haha thanks < PROPMALE > ) 
It's couple week ! Type in the date you started dating and the year you got married *~* February 2010 ... Married soon . early next year maybe . 
< PROPFEMALE > wars things that make you go hmmmm ...... \ 
Anakin\ 
builds a protocol droid to help his mom . It doesn't seem that a slave \ 
would have much use for a protocol droid . Perhaps a housework droid or a\ 
< PROPMALE > labor droid would've been more appropriate . 
I've come to the conclusion that I need to poop really bad . 
If you think I'm Cute , like this status . If you love me , put a ?. If I'm your \ 
friend , put a :) . If you would date me put a :D . If you ever had a crush \ 
on me put XD . if u hate me or really wantto punch me put :( . If you're \ 
brave enough , make this your status . 
Wooo ! Got my ring back ! Thank you honest people ! 
1 load barring vest . 35 pound ruck . 1 M16 . 1 kevlar . 25 < PROPMALE > of pain and agony . Just completed my , on the record , 2nd Manchu Mile . My feet are gone my knees destroyed my shoulders ache and I'm extremely hungry . Time to check out the damage to the feet . 
Shower then spending the day with the wifey . Last day we can < PROPFEMALE > out before gunnery ! :( 
I want to study the causes of one's behavior when they are drunk , seeing that I'm now majoring in psychology . Maybe I could do a huge study and put it all into a book and have it published . 
School is over . Got 100% on all homework assignments . 40 out of 50 on exam 1 . Just have proctored exam left to do ! WISH ME LUCK ! 
I'm thinking .... Good night world ! Movie and bed time ! 
well ... Leaving for gunnery tomorrow ... until the 24th . Lots of high speed action and fun haha . My new phone has cord to connect to computer so when i get there ill take videos and pictures and post when home haha .... \ 
Baby , I'm going to miss you so much . Love you so much ;) MMWWAAHH 
Finally back home after the worst gunnery I've been through . and I'm not talking about how I slept in my < PROPMALE > the entire time , that was fine . I'm also not talking about the lack of showers or bathrooms . It's the horrible planning that did it for me . haha but I'm home and happy ! 
9 chances out of 10 I'll be in combat within the next 2 weeks . < PROPFEMALE>'s moving into position around Japan . Russia may get in on it too ... Awesome . 
So worn out . So Achy . So long good night 
WOOOOOOOOOO July 17th , 2011 ( or around there ) 
Goin to the gym ... Still working ... 634pm ... wooohoooo 
Been up over 24 hours now ... Go Army ! Sad thing is I accidently rolled the < PROPMALE > early in the mission so we didn't even get to the objective . It's so hard to see in those simulators at night going up a hill and not knowing the road makes a sharp right at the top ... Oh well I took A2-1 with me too ahaha 
I really want Samgyupsal 
So , I ordered a toasted Italian sub from < PROPFIRST > Hood . One of my favorite sandwhiches , hadn't had one in a while . Ahjeosee finally get here after almost an hour and hands me my bottle of water and tells me he forgot the sub at the store and will be another 25 to 30 minutes ... I'm so hungry . Why me ? 
Rumor has it that this ALERT is just a drill . 96 ships will enter the same seas as the < PROPFIRST > Washington and do drills . To replace the Courageous Channel that was canceled when the Cheonon happened we will do something similar only on a USFK level instead of divison . We expect N.K. to keep up their retardedness which is why the wives are told to get ready . So everyone calm down ... 
So for lunch the < PROPFEMALE > hood guy forgot my sandwhich but brought me my water . Had to go get the sandwhich ... For dinner I get choy Canteen at 1908 but it never comes at all and they close an hour early ... gay 
You are the love of my life . The greatest this to have ever happened to me . Though you may THINK sometimes I don't love you , I always have since the day I met you baby . Everyday when I wake up is a great day because you are in my life . 
Volunteered to be QRF LMTV driver for the weekend . On a 1 hour recall for 24 hours until noon Sunday have to be in uniform yada yada . 
Figures ... The day I volunteer to be QRF driver for if N.K. attacks is the same day G . O . 1 gets lifted ... FML 
So I was mad about KTC because I was really sick and I wanted to sleep . Also because I had a meeting with the Chaplain for marriage . We get out there and the next morning the BC gets there 8th Army screwed it all up so you guys can just lay around all day So I did just that/ ran for 40 minutes around KTC . The awesome thing is I get tomorrow off so its a 5 day and since we didnt do anything today its like a 6 day haha 
Going to the gas chamber this morning . Volunteered to be one of the guys to go in for the Company Death Cup games today . Gas Chamber consists of seeing who can stay inside the chamber the longest . Fingers crossed for 2nd Plt . 
Noodles and Universal Soldier : The Return 
New music in the making ... 
Apparently I get to play < PROPFEMALE > for the Christmas party today ... haha 
Got to hear my baby's heart beat today . Was so amazed . Saw it's fingers and nails and toes and legs . If you look closely at the pic it even looks like its smiling . < PROPFEMALE > thinks it's a boy , says she sees something between it's legs haha . 
I'm tired of losing friends in the Army ... Another one leaves tonight ... :'( like real tears

Everyone calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat ! Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! ( Reposted from another friend's status . Feel free to do the same ) 
Allowed out of Jail for just one night for platoon party . Going to ONO's and take a fresh bite of freedom . They have awesome food .

So , We're pretty much decided that if it's a boy the baby will be named Jayden . < PROPFEMALE > really likes that name . We could never think of a girl's name . Then the other night I was drinking a CASS beer and though < PROPFEMALE > would be a great name . I think it sounds cute ... Opinions ? Name suggestions ( serious ones only) ? 
sooo tired today ... No work til noon tomorrow since leaving for gunnery ! 
leaving for gunnery just for a week , then coming back for a week then going back out until the end of feb 
The thing that makes me most happy in life is hearing my girl laugh ! :) 
Very sick today :( 
My spirit will never be broken or caught\ 
For the soul is a free-flowing thing\ 
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought\ 
To rise up on glorious wings 
Good day of work . Got a LOT done ( plt wise ) . The 4 mounted guys got all platoon weapons PMCS'ed . I got 86% of the 5988's filled in 1hr 30 minutes . Now , guard shift 1900 to 2100 on AHA

- < PROPFIRST > 11:28 -29 
Cant wait to see that smiling face . The innocent eyes and the laughter . July 16th ! I can't wait to meet you son ! I'll be the first person you ever see ! 
Thought my GOARMYED account was on hold for being flagged but here it's just because I need to update my TASOU . SOOO , Monday I will be signing up for my first main course for my degree ... Writing 101 
Ugh ... Getting a wisdom tooth pulled Friday ... Maybe both top ones ( I dont have bottom ones ) ... 
bout to watch KICK ASS 
So < PROPFEMALE > got into a small car accident . :( she and the baby are ok though . Going to the hospital just in case . 
OMFG my mouth hurts ... The worst part was getting the numbing shot ... The weirdest part was when they got a hammer and started hammering away on the right tooth because it was angled weird ... But the left side hurts worse . 
Interesting fact I realized about the Army this past week . The Army doesn't care how good you are at your job . You can know just about everything about your particular job but that doesn't mean shit . You can be a complete shammer , know nothing or very little about your job but as long as your good at PT , you can get promoted over someone that vastly more knowledgeable than you are . 
Korea finally gets some updated gear . IOTV's . I sized up on one but I doubt I'll get it within the 3 months i leave Korea . 
hard to find good friends ... 
Maybe beer + Percocets = pain relief from mouth pain . So glad I only had 2 wisdom teeth . 
Soooo bored ... 
the stitches in my mouth are getting EXTREMELY annoying 
24hour CQ Today on a day off .... Least I aint gotta work tomorrow .... sorta ... 
E.T. PHONE HOME !!! \ 
havent seen this movie in years 
well we got our rooms back at the old barracks today . Started moving some stuff over there tonight . Will probably finish everything up tomorrow . 
100% ITS A BOY !!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Wow , so I was going through my sent box in hotmail . I had emails in there from july 2008 . Found some really old beats I made back then . Oh the memories . Most were pretty good , may try to reproduce them . 
It's really weird , the Army preaches about being a family , helping your battle < PROPMALE > in a time of need . But when I'm in pain and need help moving the last bit of stuff from my old room to new the only ones that would help are 2 Katusas . Not the 6 US soldiers I asked for help . 
I hate when you tell someone , \have a good day\ " and they're like \ " yep\ " . Basically that means I will and I hope you have a shitty one ... haha " 
I can't believe I'm missing my sister-in-law's wedding because the Army is homo . 
Look at me now , look at me now \ 
Oh , I'm getting paper \ 
Look at me now \ 
Oh , look at me now \ 
Yeah , fresh than a muthafucker 
In her eyes is love and fire , and my heart , she's burnin through\ 
But i don't mind , in fact i like it , tho i'm terrified , i'm turned on but scared of you\ 
She's a monster , beautiful monster , beautiful monster , but i don't mind \ 
And i need her , and i need her , said i need her , said i need her , beautiful monster , but i don't mind\ 
i dont mind i dont i dont mind\ 
No i dont mind 
I need movie ideas ... My goal is to create a mass collection on movies . I'm just at a loss of what to DL next . I'm looking for comedies currently ... 
the blister on my foot is in the shape of a heart ... its weird 
So we got these high speed door locks on our new rooms . You can use a magnetic key or enter a code . And for some reason I thought of 4 digits . Well it turns out that they are the last 4 digits of my dad's cell phone which I had forgotten over my past 2 years here ... Craziness ... 
haha i poped my heart shaped blister with a cork screw fluid shot sooo far . 
just got done watchin Menace 2 Society . Forgot how great a movie it is . want more like it

mmmm I just discovered the wonderful world of technical automation clips in FL Studio . Oh how the beats are gunna change ! Everything I wasn't capable of before I can now do . Expect to hear a B . D . Smith beat soon on your favorite artists song . :) 
Wow off work before 1500 . I'm surprised ! It's been almost a year or more since that's happened . Manchu hooah .... 
time to hit the studio lay down a new beat . All these new rappers wantin on my shit kinda revivin my spirit to flow . hmmm 
debonair with flair i scare wear and tear \ 
without a care runnin shit as if i was a mayor \ 
but i aint no politician no competition \ 
sendin all opposition to see a mortician \ 
im up front never in the back drop \ 
i step on stage and get faded like a flat top 
so tired ... maybe beer n some movies tonite . a calm nite
