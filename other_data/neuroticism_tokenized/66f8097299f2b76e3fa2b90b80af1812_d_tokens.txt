RIP < PROPMALE > ... 
If you make a show of going against the times , flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways , people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them . They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior . It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch . Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness . 
reading is awesome 
damnnn colts lost that sucks .. oh well ..

Isn't it amazing how people give this administration such a hard time , accusing them of raising taxes on people when in fact they've done just the opposite , while they pay no attention to the last 8 years in which tax cuts were given to the richest group of people who did not need them and we went from a +200 billion dollar surplus to over a trillion dollar deficit . 
damnn usa lost .... now i'm going for japan 
another reminder that i still don't get it .. but then why does it always make sense to me ?

Hey , I've been gone for about a week . My power supply got fried by too much amperage being sucked off the 12 volt main rail after I upgraded to a 64-bit OS and was then using my dual-core proccessor at it's full potential . Though I had a 500 watt power supply , it only had 16 amps on the 12 volt main rail so I had to get a new power supply that's much better and some thermal gel for my CPU . But I'm back . 
It's stylish and socially-acceptable to be apathetic towards and uninvolved in politics . Too bad it's the single-most important thing you could divulge your attention on . And too bad big businesses don't have the same priorities as everyday people .

Do you ever feel like your part-mentally-challenged after reading your own words at a later time ?

I just realized what makes you popular . Agreeing with everyone and saying very little that makes you disagreeable .
