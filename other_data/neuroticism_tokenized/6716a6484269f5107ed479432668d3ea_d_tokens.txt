Strangest thing ... < PROPFIRST > woke me up at 3am , asking if I smelled smoke . We went out into the kitchen and turned on the light and you could see very subtle clouds of smoke rolling around on the ceiling . We searched the entire place , but couldn't find the source of it . So then , of course , we were afraid to go to sleep . The last thing I remember < PROPFIRST > saying to me was , \See you in the morning . I hope . \"" 

Hot and steamy baby !! :) 
You reach in and grab a handful , but before you shovel it in , you noticed there was , sitting triumphantly atop the less priviledged , was THE perfect piece of popcorn . So beautifully buttery and fat ... it also just happens to be the only piece that flips out of your hand and lands on the floor . Figures . 
Ok i'm passin it on .. During this week please change your profile picture to someone famous ( actor , musician , athelete ) you have been told you look like ... post this to your profile and message your friends with it ... 
Kids in bed , bored outta my mind waiting for < PROPFIRST > to get home from work so we can watch the final season premier of Lost !! You don't know how hard it is for me to see it sitting on the DVR and not push play ... 
My brother , < PROPMALE > , has been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia , and they're talking about possible congestive heart failure . It's not looking good . :( Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers ... 
Happy Anniversary , < PROPFEMALE > and Eddie !! :) 
I just posted this , but I'm so annoyed , I wanna post it again . I'm waiting semi-patiently on a shipment of < PROPMALE > supplies so I can paint some pieces that I need special brushes for ... and this snow is screwing everything up !! It's either snowing , or it's sunday , or it's freakin president's day ... this shipment is NEVER gonna get here !! And I'm sooooo in the mood to paint ! Dammit ! 
I swear .... getting my 3 year old to clean her room is like trying to make a man jump into a pool of piranhas ... it just ain't happenin ... 
I love it . < PROPFIRST > just cut < PROPFEMALE>'s hair with the clippers and my little blondie has a dime-sized brown patch of hair on the back of his head ! LOL Almost just as good as < PROPFEMALE>'s hair suddenly growing in bleach blonde at about 6 months old so it looked like we had dyed her hair darker cuz her roots were gleaming white . LOL 
I went outside to let the heathens pee ( the dogs , not the kids ) and an insanely strange impulse surged through me . As I looked at the snow perched like a mountain on top of the tarp covering < PROPFIRST>'s bikes , I rationalized with myself , saying it was just my inner child shining through . It didn't work . I tried to shoo it away , but it just kept nagging at me . So , I did it .... I bent over and smashed my face in the snow . 
Sorry for my hiatus guys . LOL . Let's just say I have a total skunkbag for a landlord . He had our cable and internet shut off , posing as < PROPFIRST > . But I'm back ! I went thru total fb withdrawals ! Ha ! 
It's my little man's first birthday !! He woke up in such a good mood . < PROPFIRST > , Alyx and I were saying happy birthday to him and he kept giggling ! LOL I'll try to post pics of the cake smashing later ... 
So after the whole fiasco in which our landlord had our cable and net shut off , we get it turned back on and a few days later , our computer is attacked by a freakin virus ... it was an anti virus posing as a virus to make us buy their software ( AVG ) . It disabled EVERYTHING . Got it fixed tho ... bastards . 
Well , I've started the looooong road to weight loss ! I'm determined to get rid of this damn baby belly !! I'm doing the Flat Belly Diet . I've heard good things about the book , which I have . I also have the cookbook . The food doesn't look too bad either .... AND you can eat dark chocolate on this diet !!! Hellz yeah !!! 
Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face , except a punch in the face , but we can raise awareness 
Yeah , now our furnace is kaput . We're trying to figure out if it's the actual furnace or just the thermostat ... just what we need . < PROPFIRST>'s replacing the thermostat now , so everyone keep your fingers crossed that that's it . If not , well at least the temps aren't freezing right now . At least it's a < PROPFEMALE > 50-degree day . It's actually warmer outside than inside !! 
really wants to see The Crazies !!!! 
Lost tonight !!!! I'm so friggin excited !!! These episodes are just waaaaay too intense now . Every Tuesday night , < PROPFIRST > and I are left with our mouths hanging open in awe and wonderment .... LOL 
For those of you who know me well , < PROPFEMALE > just said \1 - 2 - 4\ " !!!!!! LMAO !!! " 
OMG ... I watched Lost last night ... this poop is getting REALLY good ! Kudos to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( < PROPMALE > Linus ) for some VERY impressive acting . I actually got choked up there for a few minutes , a feeling I never would have imagined to be invoked by < PROPMALE > ! I'm tryin not to give any spoilers , Tiff , since I know you and Ant are only on season 3 , but holy cow , wait til you get to the final season !!! It's off the freakin hook ! 
Is anyone as pissed off about the prom cancellation in Mississippi as I am ? It's 2010 , people , it's time to stop being embarrassed over gays and lesbians ( even if you're against it ) . They're everywhere , whether we like it or not , and to ban a couple lesbians from attending prom is a violation of rights ... point blank . 
Well , it's early and already , < PROPFEMALE > has a ' tude . That boy has a SHORT ASS temper ! And he's sneaky to boot ... 
Okay , guys , I need some help . There's an old < PROPFIRST > Gatlin song .... one of lesser known ones ... it's about two people , a man and a woman .... and I'm thinking there's something about a bed in it ... I wanna hear it so bad , but I can never find it anywhere !!! Dad was the one who used to play it all the time , so , Dad , if you ever get on FB , now is the time !! LOL 
Feelin kinda frisky .... rrrraaawrrrrrr :) Gonna paint to expend this mounting creative energy ! 
Sittin here on FB and watching Spongebob with the kiddies :) I'm also conjuring up some ideas for a new painting ... and we ALL know what a great inspiration Spongebob is !! 
Well , for those who are interested , I will soon have all my paintings online , with a website . This is all in the works , so I don't know my web address yet . I'm so freakin anxious !! Then I'll be motivated to paint ALL THE TIME !! :D 
Was feelin a bit under the weather ... could've been the disgusting white stuff I awakened to this morning ( talkin about the snow , get your mind outta the gutter !! ) . So , I did my hair , and put on some bar-hoppin makeup just cause I could , and now I feel so energized and ready for a night @ home with the little people !! :) YAY ! 
Well , it's official . < PROPFEMALE > can walk now !! He is sooooo proud of himself . He'll toddle around the room and when he stops or falls down , he claps for himself . Of course , I'm clapping right along with him ! :) He's such a big boy !! 
Aaaahhh .... laying out in the sun , kiddies outside playing , Sagers is napping ... I'm in a great mood today !!! Maybe I can use this time to catch up on reading ... :) 
Sketched out an awesome painting idea last night ... I've been so artistically blocked lately , but this one just flowed . I hope it's the beginning of the much needed painting streak I have so desperately been waiting for . Now just to contemplate hues and background ... 
Alright , I'm doin it .... I'm goin back to blonde . I don't know how much I'll like it , I just want something different ... but , I'm NOT gonna cut it again ! Why don't people just smack me when I do shit like that ? Why do I have to be so stubborn ? 
Well , I've been a sketchin fool lately . I've done no paintings , but I have drawn out 4 sketches to paint when I feel up to it ... since < PROPFEMALE > has now started walking , we can no longer keep him within the confines of the living room . I have to < PROPMALE > him everywhere , so it looks like I won't be painting again til the newness wears off ... oh well , as long as stops dumping the dog water all over himself sometime soon ... 
is wondering why so many people let the petty crap bother them ... including myself ? I hate petty crap . It serves no function or purpose and only pisses people off ... 
I try to clean .... then these lil ankle gnomes scurry behind me and blow dust and pet furries back on everything ... then the brownies go and hide my dustrag . THAT'S IT ! I'm on strike !!! 
No matter what kind of day I've had , once I put on my big fluffy pink and purple slippers , everything gets a little better :) 
\The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one . \ " ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Shaw " 
Just saw Dear < PROPFIRST > last night ... Channing < PROPFEMALE > is just so uber freakin sexy ! Not the greatest movie tho . Kinda depressing . Guess I should go watch GI < PROPFIRST > and see him all sweaty to make up for it . :) 
Well , yesterday I was cleaning the house , but was interrupted when < PROPFIRST > got a flat on his bike and I had to take his new tires and tools to him in Canton . Then I had to wait for awhile ... oh well , poop happens , right ? I just wanna clean this place from top to bottom and then put my OCD on the back burner for awhile ... 
Ok , mama is one pissed off lady ... for some reason , Lost didn't record , so < PROPFIRST > and I missed it . We're having a < PROPMALE > bitch fest in honor of Time < PROPMALE > Cable for providing us with such excellent service ... bastards . 
Ugh . Ate some baaaad Taco Hell last night . Lets just say I had to move my bathroom party to the one out in the front hallway at 5am as opposed to using the one in our bedroom . I would have awakened < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > if I kept getting in and out of bed . I still feel awful .... no more chalupas or mexican pizzas for me for awhile ... 
< PROPFEMALE > n < PROPFEMALE > are down for naps at the same time , < PROPFIRST > is playing outside , and Alyx is outside fulfilling a punishment . I finally get some Mommy Time !!! Think I'll work on a series of sketches I've started . Just sketches .... no painting involved . Sometimes I just like to create in gray and white .... subtle . Soft shading and creepy shadows . :) 
I'm so excited !!!! < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are coming to see me tomorrow !!!! I'm gonna take < PROPFIRST>'s phone to take some pics ... my < PROPFIRST > , my baby ( and I can't wait to see you too < PROPFEMALE > , and meet you , < PROPFEMALE > lol ) ... :) I can't wait ! 
I had such an awesome time with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Tay when they came to visit me ! OMG , my daughter is so grown up ! But , man , is she beautiful !! I miss her ( and the rest of my family ) so much !! Can't wait til I move back to C-bus !!!!!!! 
DUDE ?!?! 3 people in one freakin episode !!!!!???? WTF ?? NOT happy with Lost right now !!! I bawled like a baby at the end , man I swear , it pisses me off . 
I'm so excited !! I'll be back in C-bus by the middle of June !!! I can't wait !! While I'll miss everyone up here something awful , I'm lookin forward to seeing everyone and being back in my familiar territory . < PROPFIRST>'s going to MMI in Phoenix in June , and he'll be gone for about a year . :( So , we're coming home to get settled b4 he leaves . 
Happy Mommy's Day !!!!! 
Am I the only one who sings the Fresh Beat Band's songs right along with the kids and don't even think twice about it ? Those are catchy lil tunes !! :) 
I'm in the process of trying to find a house to rent in the < PROPMALE > area , and move to rather quickly . < PROPFIRST > starts school next month and we wanted to be moved before he leaves . If anyone knows of or sees a house for rent , could you please let me know where , and possibly grab a phone # for me ?! That would be AWESOME !! Lookin on craigslist too , but nothin really there ... 
Packing , packing , packing . I hate packing . But , I loooove unpacking ! It's like Christmas and everything is so organized and clean . Then the kids come behind you like a freakin tornado and blow everything all over the place again .... * sigh * 
is bummed that she's gonna be without < PROPFIRST > for a whole year , but she is soooooo looking forward to being back with her family and friends . She'll miss her surrogate mommy , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > and Aunt < PROPFEMALE > , and the shorter lines at government offices . And she'll definately miss Motherload !! :) Goodbye Canton , hello HOME !!!!!!!! 
Okay , now that we know House and Cuddy got their freak on ... I've been * waiting * for this !! :) lol 
Well , < PROPFIRST > smashed up his first bike last night ... the nice blue one he was trying to sell to get the money for the repairs to the Ninja he's fixing to ride out to AZ for school . He got some pretty nice battle wounds , but nothing broken ( thank the Gods) ! Pics will follow a little later ... his phone got crushed in the accident , so he had to get a new one , he's just gotta figure out how to use it ... lol 
is pretty unhappy with the series finale of Lost . This was a plot that everyone had guessed back in season 2 ... however , I DO like how they made all the significant couples/partners remember each other ... I especially loved < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s reunion , and Sawyer and < PROPFEMALE>'s wasn't bad either ! But , c'mon! Seriously ? That's it ?? This is NOT how I wanted it all to end !! I feel very let down ... 
Seriously ??? Getting really annoyed ... 
RIP < PROPFIRST > Hopper ... you will be greatly missed ! :( 
is soooooo sleepy . < PROPFEMALE > had me up at 4:30 am and just went down for a nap . Guess who else is gonna be taking a nap , too . :) 
So < PROPFIRST > just left to take my little man to the hospital . I was at our friend Jenn's house when < PROPFIRST > called and said < PROPFEMALE > all of a sudden threw up everywhere . He did it 4X and got really lethargic and started running a fever . I'm so worried .... he better call me soon dammit and let me know what's going on !!! :( 
Yeah , so my night sucked . It could've been much , much worse tho . We were just leaving to take Tay back to < PROPMALE > , when I realized I had forgotten to stop at Shamrah's first , so I turned around and just as I pulled in her drive , my front passenger tire splits . As if I needed this ... if it's not one thing , it's another . 
Thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes !!! :D 
Feeling pretty happy . Hey Chad .... no comments , k ?? LMAO :) 
I will not bow . I will not break . I will shove the world away . I will not fall . I will not fade . I will take your breath away .... 
Oh gonflables .... 
Just call me < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Banana Hammock .... 
Some people just amaze the hell outta me with their self-righteousness and arrogance . :P 
HEY !! I just found a cabana boy in my pocket !! Now how'd he get in there ?? ( Not that I'm complaining .... ) :) 
\Life is just a bowl of fancy assorted cashews . \ " -- The Great < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > "

My middle name__________ , my favorite soda_______ , who's the love of my life______ , my best friend_____ , my favorite color______ , my eye color_______ , my hair color______ , my favorite food________ and my Dads name__________ !!! Put this as your status and see who knows you best . Good Luck !! ~ ~ I'm gonna guess no one knows me this well .... 
Why is it that I find House so insanely attractive ?? 
Mmmmm .... mushrooms n cream cheese :) 
Been working on a new painting today ... unsure of the color scheme still , so I've just been doing background work . I have a feeling I'm gonna be painting alot this week ... 
Feeling a < PROPMALE > artistic overload in my head ....... the question is whether or not I can keep up with it ........ ugh . :-/ 
Thoughts and prayers to all my VIP family , and to those affected by last night's tragedy . :( 
really wants to go see Sucker Punch !!! :) 
I have lost my voice yet again .... what up with that ?? 
Sorry guys ... my trigger finger is poke happy . :) 
WTF ??? Snow ? Really ??? 
Gotta go get new glasses ... I refuse to walk around lookin like an extra from Revenge of the Nerds . lol 
is majorly pissed off right now that some self-righteous person has the nerve to get in my face and threaten to beat my ass for something I didn't even do !!! WTF ?? Really , how old are we ?? Grow the hell up and keep your ignorance to yourself !!! 
Some people are just friggin insane and should be locked up .... just sayin ... 
After a very crazy week , I'm ready to < PROPFEMALE > out with my peeps @ my home away from home ... ya'll , just don't make me laugh too hard . :) 
So sacrifice yourself and let me have what's left , \ 
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes , \ 
I'm going all the way , get away , please . \ 
\ 
You take the breath right out of me , \ 
You left a hole where my heart should be , \ 
You gotta fight just to make it through , \ 
Cuz I will be the death of you . \ 
-BB ( great words ) 
If you have more than one computer mouse , would you then have \mouses\ " or \ " mice \"?" 
Fixed shrimp and scallop < PROPMALE > with zucchini for dinner .... no stupid < PROPMALE > from a jar either . This chick made her own !!! YUM !!!!! :) 
Can I just say that even through my mild soreness , that storm last night had me sleepin like a baby !! ' Tis the season !!!! :) :) :) 
Chocolate milk with Hershey's Special Dark syrup ..... mmmmmm . < PROPFIRST > is a happy girl . :) 
Zucchini and mushroom quiche for dinner .... and Alyx is helping me ! :) Definately gonna be like her mama !! 
I guess sleep just wasn't in the cards for me last night ... oh well ... my pencil and sketchbook are happy that I paid them some attention . They've been feeling quite neglected lately ... 
FYI : When you're drinking , permanent markers are bad ... 
I dig my toes into the sand . \ 
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket . \ 
I < PROPFEMALE > against the wind , \ 
Pretend that I am weightless . \ 
And in this moment I am happy . \ 
Happy . 
I think we all need to gang up on Mother Nature and give her a stern talking to ... 
Nothin like getting < PROPFIRST > horses in both calves , at exactly the same time .... guess I need to increase my banana consumption . :P 
What hurts the most\ 
Is being so close\ 
And having so much to say\ 
And watching you walk away\ 
And never knowing\ 
What could have been\ 
And not seeing that loving you\ 
Is what I was trying to do 
\Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness\ " . Best damn cd title . Ever . " 
Just watched the 2 hour series/season premiere of The Killing on AMC ... \Who killed < PROPFEMALE > Larsen ? \ " Looks like it's gonna be a pretty damn interesting show . Been wanting something thought-provoking and puzzling since Lost ended last year .... yay !! :) " 
Today is a good day to go outside and play in the rain . ;) 
So break yourself against my stones , and spit your pity in my soul ... 
Think about how many times I have fallen\ 
Spirits are using me ... larger voices callin\ 
What Heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten .... 
And when I close my eyes I see you\ 
No matter where I am\ 
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines\ 
I'm with your ghost again\ 
It's a shame about the weather\ 
I know soon we'll be together\ 
And I can't wait till then\ 
I can't wait till then ...
