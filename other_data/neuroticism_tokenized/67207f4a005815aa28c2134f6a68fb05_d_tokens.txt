The reason I talk to myself is because I am the only person whose answers I accept .

I wanna live . I don’t wanna die . That’s the whole meaning of life : NOT dying ! I figured that shit out by myself in the third grade .

How many ways to get what you want ? I use the best , I use the rest . I use the Enemy . I use Anarchy . 
Property is theft . Nobody “owns” anything . When you die , it all stays here .

What < PROPFIRST>'s reading right now : http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications/lifein.htm 
MY HOROSCOPE : Thinking of doing something different with your hair , body or wardrobe ? Good for you . Change is good for the soul and refreshing to the spirit . Just don't get carried away . You wouldn't want a dear one to walk by you without recognizing you , 
Give my regards to whoever it is that is accepting regards at this appointed time . 
I'm on a Clash binge . Don't bother me . *_*

Most of the time I feel okay . Probably it’s because at the moment I'm not actually dying .

had a dream the other night , where I was all alone in the dark walking alongside an ocean ; but I couldn't see it because there were a bunch of trees in the way . 
Mikey F*#%ng Way . 
MY HOROSCOPE : Just when you were sure you'd never , ever hear from them again , guess what ? You'll see or hear from someone who'll mention that this particular missing person has been seen , and that they've mentioned your name . Remember , when you're thinking of someone , it's often because they're thinking of you , too . Prepare yourself to meet up with them , and don't pretend that you're not tickled when it happens . 
treated myself to some consignment shopping , and then pizza . Couldn't really finish it , though ; its kinda hard to eat when your tummy is full of butterflies . ? _ ?

Looks like its gonna be a cloudy night . Go fucking figure . T.T 
MY HOROSCOPE : Don't hold back your feelings for a single second longer . Everyone wants to hear all about them , especially the person who's inspired your happiness . Besides , you're feeling so darned good , it's written all over your face . Share the wealth . It's not fair to keep all that stuff to yourself . Can't the rest of us have a little bit of it ? So we can walk a mile in your glass slippers ?

My guitar gently weeps . 
Gravity makes the world go ' round . 
A house is just a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff . 
This heat brings to mind a verse or two from a certain < PROPFEMALE > song from 1999 in which < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > did all the singing . O_x 
Its not a halo ; I'm radioactive . 
Swimming is not a sport -- swimming is a way to keep you from drowning . X_X 
God bless the homicidal maniacs -- they make life worthwile . 
having some coffee and thinking about what to do today . 
The biggest jerk at Hidewriter is mere inches away from being ousted . That's good for me , since I'm gunning for his job . Oh yes . I rule . 
thinking about doing some Limewire to-nite ; there's a song by Endless Hallway that I really want . *_~ 
There's either a problem with Facebook or my computer ; it only lets me log on at noon . 
The system is fine . Nothing is wrong . 
Its gonna be one of those sleepy days , I can feel it . 
Tornado warning a few hours ago , but there was no tornado . A damn shame , too ; I was totally looking forward to it . 
Y'know what a cool word is ? \Turpentine\ " . I just think its fun to say . ;P "

What the Hell is going on with music these days ?! Now Oasis is splitting up ?!? NO ! NO I WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS MADNESS !!!! 
Autumn sunshine . ... I can't really say I hate it , since its practically identical in < PROPFEMALE > and intensity to Spring sunshine . At least its not Winter sunshine , which thankfully only lasts for one day . 
has had this overpowering urge to listen to LiVE lately ; who , I might add , are most certainly NOT a Christian band . Anyone who thinks that LiVE is a Christian band has obviously never listened to ' Mental Jewelry ' . 
FRITOOOOOOOS !! { That's what Braveheart would yell in the slacker version of the movie of the same name . } 
When < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > looks at the Sun , the Sun goes blind .

having some coffee and listening to music . ( < PROPFIRST > Bowie -\Changes \") ??? " 
Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons , for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup . 
needs to conjure up some stiff motivation and attack my bedroom with a broom and duster . I don't know what it is about my little slice of paradise ( sarcasm ) that makes me put my Spring cleaning off until Fall , but it is definitely taxing for my allergies . 
could sure go for a game of chess right now ; but I'm the only one in the house who knows how to play . So I guess I'll be playing against myself -- which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't keep losing track of which side's turn it is . 
is ready for another fun-filled day of idiosyncrasies . ;) 
has just updated to Limewire 5.2.13 . Of course , now I need transfer all of my music files into the library . Should be done @ about midnight . 
finished sooner than I thought ! 59:51:42 worth of music . That's 864 songs . That's 3.28 gigs . All taken care of in record time . ;) 
The new Limewire interface infuriates and confuses me , so I downgraded back to 4.18.8 . If you're ever on , all files belonging to me are signed S*h*a*n*g*r*i *~~* L*a . My collection is the best open-source collection there is . (* wink , wink *) 
spent the day organizing and updating media collection . 
Recent downloads : Endless Hallway - \A Bad Current\ " / Owl City - \ " Fireflies\ " / Iron Butterfly - \ " In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\ " . An oldie but a goodie . ;) "

Blue Oyster Cult / Moby / The < PROPFEMALE > Underground / Iced Earth / The New Amsterdams / Placebo / Less Than < PROPMALE > / Big Audio Dynamite . 
I believe that the cone is the most disturbing shape geometry has to offer . I can't help but feel a little creeped out whenever I see one . 
Got a phone call from my uncle < PROPFIRST > . From what I can gather , it looks like his brother , my other uncle , < PROPFIRST > is getting ready to kick it . He's only 63 . 
For some reason , WMP won't let me burn CDs ; it'll go half way and then all of a sudden stop and spit the disc out . So I have to do it through Roxio . 
My tie-dye-colored pick magically re-appeared , so I guess I'll jam for a bit . 
Today , a milestone . < PROPFEMALE>'s first Bush-free 9/11 . Feels different , doesn't it ? I could sit here , pull apart Dubya's lies , and lay down the real reason the administration allowed 9/11 to happen , but without the fear of being spirited away to Gitmo in the middle of the night , where's the fun in that ? 
Feeling nostalgic today . The Doors / Electric Light Orchestra / < PROPFEMALE > Cooper / The Animals / Creedence Clearwater Revival / < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > / Big Brother and the Holding Company .

is gonna take a nap . Then maybe later I'll do something constructive . 
I was going to burn all of my yearbooks , but I went to get a sandwich , and then the phone rang ; the next thing I knew it was four years later and I hadn't burned my yearbooks . I finished looking through them just now . All seven of them . And I'm kinda glad I didn't burn my yearbooks . 
I've got my Halloween costume all figured out . ( Ah , yes ; my foresight has always been legendary . ) I'm going as < PROPFIRST > Ramone ! < PROPFEMALE > is indeed a punk rocker .

playing around with a completely random tuning -- D# , F# , B , E , G# , B . I'm trying to come up with my own sound ; and this is TOTALLY demented . @_@ 
Had much much fun today . Got a mini-makeover ; my hair is super short and super blonde now . Afterwards I popped in @Hidewriter , got sum happy birthdayness there . :P 
After two or three more blonde treatments , I'm a-going to be dying my hair blue . Blue like the color of this electronic tuner sitting on my desk . You can't see it , though ; because its on my desk . 
took a nap , fed the cats , fed the bird , ate my din-din , and now its MSNBC time . ;P 
Save a drum -- bang a drummer . 
OMFG what is WRONG with people ?!? The world is NOT going to end in 2012 . ( Though I really wish it would ... ) 
So its come to this -- I've been reduced to relying heavily on Wiccan magick . Which has a coin toss's < PROPMALE > of being at all effective . My , oh my , the mighty have fallen . 
The spirit was moving me to do another Tarot reading , so I did ; and this is what I got -- 1 : The < PROPFEMALE > / 2 : Knight of Coins / 3 : Seven of Coins / 4 : Four of Cups / 5 : The Fool / 6 : Justice / 7 : Six of Coins / 8 : The Chariot / 9 : < PROPMALE > of Coins / 10 : < PROPMALE > of Wands . 
Last night I dreamt I was being attacked by a giant centipede . Well , not reeeaaally attacked ; more like I was screaming at it and beating the little fucker with a shoe . 
The stupid cat won't let me sleep ; so I guess I'll listen to some music . 
just woke up from a nap ... but I don't at all remember going to sleep . Anyways , I had a dream that I was in an animal shelter , and I was petting a giant , hairless , laughing rabbit . 
?? Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea , and something something something , he is smoking weed ~ ??. 
playing some more of those motherfucking covers that I can't seem to shake off , like a fucking cancerous disease . 
Blessed be the Giver , Cursed be the Thief ; May Fortune smile upon the True , And Liars come to Grief . 
... And for dinner -- a glass of milk and a great big box of fruit-by-the-foot . Doesn't get any better than that . Oh , the joys of living as a starving artist . :P 
HOORAY FOR MOST THINGS !!!! ^_^ 
If it pleases , I would like to wager $10 US on the following scenario : 2012 comes . 2012 goes . The world is fine . Nobody dies . Nothing even remotely catastrophic happens . And The History Channel files for bankruptcy for buying into this lunacy in the first place . 
How about a little fire , Scarecrow ? 
slept for most of the day ; now I feel pretty . *_~ 
Coffee and a pop-tart , then its gee-tar time ~ ! ^_^ 
Capitalism tries for a delicate balance : It attempts to work things out so that everyone gets just enough stuff to keep them from getting violent and trying to take other people’s stuff . 
If at first you don't succeed , scream , kick , throw things , swallow a fistful of aspirin , cry yourself to sleep , wake up twelve hours later , and try again . ' Tis a simple philosophy , but I've always found it useful .

' Yoshi's Safari ' , when played using that ridiculous SuperScope , is a pain in the ass . However , when played on the computer , as an illegal ROM , using the mouse , ' Yoshi's Safari ' becomes one of the easiest games in existance . 
... Okay , Miriah's mad at me for God-only-knows why , so I guess that meeting with < PROPMALE > is off . Well , tit for tat ! I can find a drummer WITHOUT her . 
Miriah quit Hidewriter this afternoon , ergo screwing me out of the only real employment prospect I had ; without the benefits that go along with nepotism I can kiss being \stencil girl\ " goodbye . May < PROPMALE > burn in Hell . " 
Now , I don't really believe in this kind of stuff , but a thought just struck me : What if AIG , Big Pharma , and their like are the \Antichrist ? \ " I'm serious about this . I challenge anyone to give Revelations a good flip-through to see if I'm right . Which I usually am . " 
Chess is a lot like war , only cheaper . It's the perfect game for < PROPFEMALE > ; a country that's very warlike and dead-ass broke . That being said , my record stands at 2-5 . 
< PROPMALE > is very sorry , and Miriah got her job back . 
At least , thanks to your constant fawning , I have an excuse for my social ineptness . What's yours ? 
I go to feed the cats this morning , when I notice that one of them is holding a mouse between his teeth . Luckily , the little thing is still alive . When he put it down to eat it ran away and I tried to save it . I don't know where it is now . 
I got soul but I'm not a soldier . 
My life is a lot like ' The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang ' ; mindlessly collecting tomatoes and killing evil garlic cloves by throwing my hat at them . 
Mum thought her truck was stolen . She was absolutely positively convinced her truck was stolen . She had her keys , purse , money and medications in that truck . She calls the police . She tells them her truck was stolen . She wanders around town looking for her stolen truck . Lo and behold ! it was right where she parked it . 
MSNBC's airing a documentary about Jonestown tonight . I've always had this fascination with < PROPMALE > Jones ; I never ever miss a show about him .

So my uncle < PROPFIRST > and aunt < PROPFEMALE > had uncle < PROPFIRST > in the car with them and were heading back to Ohio . Out on the highway , < PROPFIRST > looks back at < PROPFIRST > and asks him if he would like a snack or anything . < PROPFIRST > answers , \I WANT A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH . \ " This kind of flakiness runs long and deep in both sides of my family .

The days are much too bright ; I only come out at night . *_* 
Pretty lazy day today ; locked myself away in my room and played cards for about six straight hours . Haden , Scarab , Flower Garden , Canfield , and others of the like . 
I can count to purple ! 
Dusting is a good example of the futility of trying to put things right . As soon as you dust , the fact of your next dusting has already been established .

The very existence of flamethrowers proves that sometime , somewhere , someone said to themselves , “You know , I want to set those people over there on fire , but I’m just not close enough to get the job done . ”

Patchouli incense , pretending I did NOT just hear some MAN on TV talking about MENOPAUSE . Exactly how many hot flashes have YOU had , Sir ??? T_T

YES ! You see , THIS is how Democracy works . When the people speak with one voice , things get done . But when its corporations doing the speaking , as well as pumping absurd amounts of money into Repbulican PACs to get their candidates to Washington so they can do their bidding for Them , well , that would be just plain un-American , wouldn't it ? But * ha * thank goodness THAT hasn't happened . { sarcasm } 
I think its hilarious that 30 seconds after a person joins one of those inane dating sites , some random idiot somewhere in cyberspace instantaneously falls madly in love with them . TOTALLY normal behavior .
