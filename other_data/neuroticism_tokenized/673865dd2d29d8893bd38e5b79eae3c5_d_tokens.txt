It has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post ... if you have at least 1 of these friends . 
Y do peoples true colors emerge when u call them out on their ways of meanness ?? I think it is so funny !!! If u wanna see if someone is your friend just confront them about ANYTHING . And then wait 4 their reaction . :D
