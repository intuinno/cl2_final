Ashley . :) Do you realize that I still have your bday gift ? I'm wondering if you have school this Friday . The shops at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > are open at midnight on Friday . CRAZY deals going on ! I've been foraging the web and have gift vouchers for designer chick treats . I've also invented modified cattle catchers we can both strap on our midriffs during our morning marathon . Let me know what you think . Love you , dear , always .

Bit of daily wisdom : NEVER under any circumstances sign up for a match service , NOT EVEN ON A DARE !!! 
Goodbye to the match service and on with the job search ! < PROPFEMALE > LA DOLLAR < PROPMALE > !!!! And of course , love , sex , endorphins , turtles and space cadets of all descriptions . 
Feeling a bit woosey and tired . My dentist extracted one of my lower jaw molars this past Monday . I hope things start looking up soon and I can get some things accomplished .
