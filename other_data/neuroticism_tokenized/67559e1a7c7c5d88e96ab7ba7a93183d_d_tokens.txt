So now we fly ever free\ 
We're free before the thunderstorm\ 
on towards the wilderness\ 
Our quest carries on\ 
Far beyond the sundown , \ 
far beyond the moonlight\ 
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls\ 
So far away we wait for the day\ 
For the light source so wasted and gone\ 
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days\ 
Through the fire and the flames we < PROPFEMALE > on 
tired , good day though ..... but very tired . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFIRST > MILLER ! 
I have to say , those were the most awkward 75 minutes of my life . Never thought I would have to be in the same room as my mom , dad , and their lawyers . Not fun either . 
Baseball season 7 weeks left\ 
Football season 4 weeks away\ 
Hockey season 8 weeks away\ 
having the patients to not kill yourself during the off-season is hard ... 
hockeyfest in 2 days . pretty crazy . 
good party , hockey tomorrow at 1 , then sleep ...... then HOCKEYFEST ! 
HSBC Arena tomorrow , I really hope there's someone cool there to give autographs , Leopold would be fine , but Ennis , Myers , Miller , or Vanek would be great .

This divorce thing is on a totally different level than what I was hoping for . Everything that has happened in the past week and everything that will happen for a while ... I'm sorry to everyone . Just so confused , don't know what's right and wrong . 
physics- HURRAY . I think I'm the only one that doesn't understand this stuff . Completely don't understand it . 
Brockport was awesome , got me out of Physics lab , and it is a great school , next is SUNY Cortland . hmmm ...... 
When it rains , it pours . :( 
Cortland tomorrow . 2 1/2 hour drive won't be fun , but otherwise , I'm looking forward to missing some more school [: 
SUNY Cortland is great . Some advantages and disadvantages over Brockport . decisions , decisions ... hmmmm 
< PROPFIRST > McCoy and < PROPFEMALE > Crawford , you both need to post in the fantasy forum or he may cut your team . He is looking for active contributers . Just a heads up . \ 
go here to http://hockey.fantasysports.yahoo.com/hockey/54941/messages \ 
If you go farther down the < PROPFEMALE > and click on my post ( it is titled ' Hi ' ) and hit reply , just basically reiterate what I said . 
Sabres pre-season game . Can't wait ! 
Sabres game was AWESOME . Going to next weeks pre-season game ( against Philly on Sunday @ 5 ) . \ 
Lot's of video to upload . Great night . :) 
Said by < PROPFEMALE > Crawford- \The Sedins piss me off . Don't know why 
Long day , huge weight off my shoulders though . Physics has lost me just little bit , hopefully it makes sense soon . Sabres keep winning though , so everything is alright . :) \ 
Still working on homework , haha 
1 week until the \official\ " hockey season . \ 
Sprained ankle . Loads of fun . 
Sabres pre-season game #2 at home . Better smoke them Flyers . Rally the troops , it's almost game time ~ ~ p-a-r-t-y ! 
Sabres game was AWESOME ! 9-3 , I got a lot of goals on video . Will upload later if possible . Great day , ( ignoring the Bills blunder ) . 
Woah , hockey season , IN 2 DAYS !!!!!!! when did this happen ? haha . \ 
Thursday is a new beginning . 
New south park on tonight , fantasy draft in about an hour , NHL season starts tomorrow , Sabres begin on Friday , and NO PHYSICS HOMEWORK !!!!!! \ 
I don't see how this day can get any better . :] 
Now who is excited for the SAT's ? I sure as hell am not . SAT round 2 begins @ 8:00 tomorrow . 
I'm always 3 steps ahead of you to help you when you need it and 2 steps behind you to catch you when you fall . 
Interesting night last night . Well , now I'm off to do a Physics Lab write up that I'm lost on , haha . Good news : Sabres vs Hawks at 7:00 . :]]]]] 
Physics is done . 5 minutes until the Sabres game . Great timing . haha . \ 
LETS GO BUFFALO ! 
I just lost a lot of respect for the Chicago Blackhawks . < PROPMALE > Cup my ass . \ 
Pominville's streak of almost 400 consecutive games started is over :( 
Lot's of stuff on my mind . You don't really notice what you've got in life until you lose it . Somethings just look and feel a lot smaller than they did only a day ago . 
\If you com-bust in my classroom 
Sabres game then South park . Nice way to end a very good day . :) 
Boring day . Physics and Street Law hw , then a couple hockey games . \ 
Saturday will be great , like usual . TO FREDONIA ! 
Sabres game tonight . Fredonia in the morning , then hockey , then Sabres game again . \ 
good weekend .... Surprisingly another good day in physics . :] 
Fredonia was nice , a lot smaller than I had originally thought it was . Good day at hockey . \ 
Sabres game in about 4 hours , can't wait ! 
Sunday is just homework . Lots of it though , but nothing else is going on . WOO HOO for laziness . :)

Anyone need help with Trig ( or math in general ) homework ? Just ask . haha 
Just got home . Long long day . Can't wait for some sleep . haha GO SABRES ! 
homework , homework , homework . Just had to dump it all on one night ? 
Saturday is almost here !!!!!! \ 
Then the week starts all over again :( \ 
Then another Saturday rolls around !!!!!!!! \ 
Then the week starts over again :( \ 
That has been my school year so far . haha 
Never again will I take a part of a 17 man shootout ( with 1 goalie ) for 6 rounds . Never . \ 
Other than that , very , very tired . Sabres game in 2 1/2 . :) 
Trust me , I'm a Doctor ..... Dr. Pepper . :) 
Sabres on the war path WHO-HA . Sabres on the war path WHO-HA 
Storm ? Try SABRES/ PHYSICS PARTY ! 
You learn many things when you < PROPFEMALE > out with your friends . \ 
1 . ) Don't give them pop unless you are prepared for them being hyper\ 
2 . ) Don't let them make popcorn in an unfamiliar microwave\ 
\There's a popcorn button ? \"- after the house smells like burnt popcorn . lol " 
7-0 in volleyball . I've changed my mind about that sport , it's actually quite fun . haha 
Hockey was fun . I wish I had just a bit better defense in the 1st game . I was kind of left out to dry with 2-0's . :/ 2nd game was great , stopped 4 break-aways , then let in a \crappy\ " goal to ruin the shut-out . \ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s a bitch . Beware . 
So I'm expecting us to win by 20 tomorrow . GO BUILLDOGS . Show no mercy . 
Just stating a fact :\ 
The < PROPMALE > Bulldogs have more wins at < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Stadium than the Bills . 
National Chest Bump Day is on my birthday ? That right there is an awesome present . :) 
Ultimate Birthday Present . \ 
< PROPFIRST > - 3 goals , 2 assists . \ 
Vanek- 2 goals , 2 assists . \ 
Stafford- 1 goal , 3 assists . \ 
Myers- 1 goal , 2 assists . \ 
Leopold- 0 goals , 5 assists . \ 
Lalime- Shutout . 
So um yeah , thanks a lot New England for that poor effort that you called defense today . I'm appreciating the -2 points you gave me for fantasy . Same goes to BenJarvus Green-Ellis . 14 yards is just not enough . I'm thinking I should have went with < PROPFIRST > instead of the Pats . 
Life is good when the Village Board meeting starts at 7:30 and is over by 7:50 . \ 
ALSO , all garbage for Thanksgiving week is supposed to be put out on the 24th ( the Wednesday before ) . 
Possibly having a good night then a better day tomorrow , but SOME PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE UP THEIR MINDS . lol 
Duffs was good , Lab Write up . Other than that , GO SABRES ! 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > Vanek . I feel like a genius trading for you and giving up almost nothing . You make me look really smart . Thank you < PROPFIRST > Vanek . 
two straight wins at the < PROPMALE > by scores of 14-12 ..... \ 
looks like < PROPMALE > left a noticeable impression . 
So 6 games ago I said the Sabres will get a point in 26 straight games . \ 
We're 4-0-2 since I said that . \ 
' Nuff said . 
THANK YOU < PROPFIRST > VICK . \ 
42 fantasy points and still producing . WOOO !!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > Cammalleri SNIPE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Scrubs\ 
best show ever . 
homework homework homework ...... ugh . :/// 
Buffalo has outscored Los < PROPFEMALE > 23-4 in winning the last three meetings at HSBC Arena . \ 
Only averaging 7.67 goals a game against them recently in Buffalo . NOT BAD . 
My jew senses are tingling . Saved $85 on clothes . ($150- coupons = $65 ) . Got an awesome Sabres jacket . Looking forward to Christmas for a change . :) 
So why in the world did TBS have to show School of Rock . They know I have to watch the entire thing , it just doesn't want to end . :) 
Lab Write up . Hooray ? Everyone better do it because I'm not in the mood to do homework over the break , and I'm pretty sure no one else wants to do homework either . 
Long , long day . Thinking ....... just thinking ...... 
< PROPMALE > Potter was surprisingly good . Needs more action , BUT , excited for PART II 
Another day of hockey . This week has been surprisingly really awesome so far . :) 
The x-box community has just claimed another life . 
< PROPFIRST > Vanek with a Bazooka lol 
I forgot how much I love shoveling the driveway . :/ 
SNOW DAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
HELL YEAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > Duttweiler , you sir are a cereal killer & you can't wink secretively . 
\Elliot got caught with his pants down\ " \ 
Ennis needs to shoot the puck . every time it's just pass , intercepted , pass , intercepted ....... he's starting to get on my nerves . 
This is going to be a really long Christmas ..... 
Sick for the first time in a few years .... such a nice run . :/ Just in time for the holidays . >:( 
So I miss 1 Sabres game and the Sabres decide to not show up . That's just not fair . 
So I figured out that when someone's ABS light turns out everything is Absolutely Bull-Shit and the car just won't move . haha . What a crazy long night with < PROPMALE > Colson & Co . lol\ 
Nothing like sitting in a broken car for 40 minutes waiting for help . hahaha 
hockey hockey hockey :) ....... after physics hw :/ 
Hockey was fun , still a little tired though . NHL 11 is still awesome , I need to learn how to shoot down . Kind of got raped 4-0 thanks to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ( I blame Hiller ) . haha\ 
Gotta finish that physics hw . :/ 
The Decade ends in 8 days . I have no homework over break . Wow , this is going to be probably the best Christmas Break EVER . \ 
I don't have that many plans , lets see what kind of trouble I can get myself into within the week . hmmmm ...... 
On the first day of Christmas break , I get to wreck my older cousin in NHL 11 . \ 
Happy Holidays ( to all the politically picky people)\ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ( to all the people who really celebrate the holidays ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . Hope your holidays are filled with love and joy , I know mine will be . :)

1st game wasn't bad . 4-0 . 1 goal 2 assists +4 . I guess it's on pace ... 
Finally started the physics project . haha 
Physics has taken yet another day from my week . Good news , only 2 more that it can possibly take .

Ah , no school , no nothing for the next 3 days . Sweet . :) 
what a great time for my furnace to break . It's kind of cold in my house . :/ 
Physics exam was fun . Subway was better . < PROPMALE>'s world 2 makes everything better . Good day , not as good as yesterday , but still a good day . :) 
I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted Him as my personal Savior . A facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father at the Gates of Heaven . This is simple . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , repost .... 
Lovely weather to play hockey in . Hopefully the snow slows down a little . 
7-2 , not bad I guess . haha\ 
rollin with 14 points in 4 games , mediocre nonetheless . \ 
GO SABRES ! 
Wait a minute , is this the first time the Sabres have gotten a break with the Refs ? HOLY SHIT . WRITE THIS DOWN IN HISTORY .

Off to hockey now , hopefully the Sabres will do well in my absence from the TV . GO ENROTH .

3 goals and 1 assist . I got my 20 points in 6 games like I wanted . WOO ! ;) \ 
Hopefully playoffs don't betray us like they normally do . 
One of the greatest sights of all-time :\ 
Opening up your mailbox and seeing a letter from 1 Setmour H . Knox III Plaza addressed to Will < PROPMALE > . Open it up , and out come 4 Sabres tickets . SAWEET !!! 
Learning new things everyday . haha ;) 
One of the best Sundays in a long time . Got to < PROPFEMALE > out with my girl then went to go see Hallpass with the dudes . One of the greatest movies made in quite a long time . :)) 
< PROPMALE > Boyes 1 goal in 1 game with the Sabres\ 
< PROPMALE > Neidermeyer 0 goals in 62 games with the Sabres\ 
does that tell you something ? 
Very good Sunday . Wish more days were like today . Glad the girl came over for the day . Sabres won . Life is good :) 
Fever of 103.9 , dizziness , migraines , ear infections , dehydration , and a bunch of other side effects . That was a fun past few days . No medicine , just sleep is the perfect cure . 46 hours of sleep . hahaha\
