Got my wisdom teeth out yesterday , but I'm feeling better today . Yay for chocolate pudding too 

Panda has an ear infection , but she was extremely well behaved for the vet . The vet also assistant seemed to like her . The poor < PROPFEMALE > needs ear drops twice a day though . 
It's really late , but there was a car accident on route 40 . They closed off half of the road . The fact that it was obviously two cop cars that crashed ? Priceless .
