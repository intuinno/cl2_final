Tulsa has fair weather , I live in a nice apartment with 3 livable roommates . Start school Monday . Need a car and a job . To my friends , family , and loved one I miss and love y'all very much . I'm gonna make y'all proud ! 
Really stressed about the new environment . But I really shouldn't be ... I found a job already , and class started yesterday , got a fiscally smart plan where i'll be saving money . Sounds like I'm doing pretty good ! But none the less it is testing me ... 
Getting thirsty for some Coke-A-Cola ! And some cherry-pie . Hope I gets some this weekend ! 
Doing pretty good ! Keeping really busy , I'm very happy it's already been a month . :)
