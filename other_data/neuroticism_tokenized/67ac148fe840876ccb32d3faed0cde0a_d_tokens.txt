In the united states the average person spends 3 years waiting in line ... 
If you have 3 quarters , 4 dimes , and 4 pennies , you have $1.19 . You also have the largest amount of money in coins without being able to make change for a dollar . 
Cats sleep 16 to 18 hours per day . 
When you die your hair still grows for a couple of months . <- thats interesting .. 
The most money ever paid for a cow in an auction was $1.3 million . 
The sound of E.T. walking was made by someone squishing her hands in jelly ... 
1 in 5,000 north Atlantic lobsters are born bright blue . 
The human heart creates enough pressure to squirt blood 30 feet ( 9 m ) . 
When snakes are born with two heads , they fight each other for food .

6 months ago tomarrow was the day we sharred our first high five , our first word , and our first pinky promise .. :] 
each and every day we walk along side our peers , whether they love Jesus or not , and if we , as Jesus lovers , life our life accordingly to His word , we may impact them in ways we wouldnt even assume possible . show God's unconditional love so that it will \SHINE\ " from you ! Make the most of every opportunity ! " 
Im so thankful for you ! :D 
every night we talk each other to sleep , yet we never run out of things to say ! The time we are apart , we spend thinking about the next time we will get to spend a minute , or a day , with each other . just one and a half days left .. :]
