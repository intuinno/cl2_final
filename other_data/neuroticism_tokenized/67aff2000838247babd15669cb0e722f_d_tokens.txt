\Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel 
I require some assistance . I am looking to build my self-confidence ; since I often doubt myself in great levels , and fail to get across what needs to be said . 
Angel of Music , you've deceived me . I gave you my mind blindly . 
< PROPFEMALE > Cabral- Incubus is going to be in San Bernardino on Oct 16 for the Smokeout festiville . Tickets are $75 ! 
Hehe . Imhotep is stretched out across his tank . He has his tail in the water bowl , and his head up on top of his tree . The rest of his body is just kinds stretched up diagonally . He is so cute . 
I realize that it is a good that I try very hard and I am persistent , but sometimes all it does is hurt me more . I really cannot fathom as to why I try so hard in things that I know will just hurt me in the end . I do not understand how I can become so attached to something that seems so ridiculous to others , and then when I should care a great deal I am devoid of all feeling . 
As a sorrow filled good-bye escapes my lips . On true happiness I do grip . Yet , between it and I there is a fortress that must succumb to my pursuit of happiness . All things I would give just for one more moment of the utter bliss . 
Did you hear the one where a guy flew really close to sun and touched it in exactly one spot ? 
Rofl . My dad is already missing classes . He doesn't feel like going tonight . 
< PROPFEMALE > Nuñez I miss you !!! Come back !!! 
Woot < PROPMALE > Quinteros and I are singing Technicolor Phase 
I took a nap , and now I've missed the game . Lame .. 
My darling baby brother wrote me a letter . ^_^ 
I am getting rather annoyed by guilds only recruiting people age 18+

QQ QQ QQ I am not going to the smokeout festival anymore . QQ QQ QQ Bye-bye dreams of seeing Incubus preform . 
Apparently , in WoW you can no longer roll need on shadow gems if you wait too long . Rolling is more important than dpsing these days . 
I got into < H A T E D > !!!!! WOOOOOOO !!!!! * HAPPY DANCE * 
Back from an awesome weekend in Redondo . We did a lot of evangelizing and ministering at the Pier . One guy gave his life it Christ . I can't wait to go back . 
Happy 10:10 on 10-10-10 
Patch day ... 
54% done in 52 minutes . 
Logging out hoping my installer speeds up . 
Ugh ! Priest specs got stomped . I am tired of trying to make it work with the points I have ! 
Why can't Blizzard make < PROPMALE > friendly patches ?! Why ?! 
One out of 10 people born is gay . That means 1 out of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are committing suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better and ... you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% of you who will . 
Today , when I woke up , I though of something . I thought about how I am open instantly with some people and how I am so quick to shut up people out ; I do both of these things with out really knowing people too well . I am not sure why , nor am I proud of it . 
* sigh * tonight's raid was horrible ... 
What did I miss at school today ?

Think the storms will make the power at school go out ? Aha .

I will be out of commission for a while until I can get this new ailment under control . But , at least I got an answer this time after 10 hours in the Hospital . < PROPFIRST > Valley Community Hospital > ALL other hospitals in the Ville . 
So , I failed today . I forgot to write down the homework for Shibata's Trig class . Can someone send it to me please ? :-) 
You were taught , with regard to your former way of life , to put off your old self , which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires ; to be made new in the attitude of your minds ; & to put on the new self , created to be like God in true righteousness & holiness . Ephesians 4:22 -24 
Real Healers don't use Healbot ; Oh an I guess I am allowed to bubble heal Pally Tanks now . O.o

As I sit here thinking , I find that my heart has succumbed to His grace and He has given me love . 
Check this out . I think you guys will like it a lot . I know , I do . \ 
It has a lot to do with how we are to not only Glorify God in GOOD times but also in BAD times . And how that will make us strong . 
If the world would fall apart\ 
In a fiction worthy wind\ 
I wouldn't change a thing\ 
Now that you're here 
Worst start of a holiday break ever . 
Proverbs 22 : 4\ 
Humility is the fear of the LORD ; its wages are riches and honor and life . 
My family needs prayer right now . We need strength and peace of mind . And we need a lot of prayer for the heart of our family . Our pride and joy . The woman that has blessed all of our lives and given us hope . Please pray . Please . 
Then when lust has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and when sin is accomplished , it brings forth death . \

< PROPFEMALE > is currently up on top of her tree . She has her head barely hanging off to look down . She is intently watching the entrance to her tree . It is as thought she is waiting for a mouse to run by at any moment so she can swoop down and have dinner . 
\You could be happy\ 
Extremely ill . Things are getting worse . I feel like my eyes are going to jump out of their sockets at any moment . Yay , for additional symptoms to an already miserable illness ... 
As a note : When your name looks like you smashed your keyboard and your picture is of some random object -- You need to delete your account and go back to MySpace .

Galatians 6:7 -9 ( New International Version , ©2010)\ 
7 Do not be deceived : God cannot be mocked . A man reaps what he sows . 8 Whoever sows to please their flesh , from the flesh will reap destruction ; whoever sows to please the Spirit , from the Spirit will reap eternal life . 9 Let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up . 
I am at 67 friends . But , I a not deleting anyone this time around . Instead , I am restructuring my life and my daily activities and what-not . Lucky people . Absolutely , lucky . Aha ! ( Has lost her mind officially , and plans on rebuilding a new one ! )

Sitting in an endless mystery\ 
Enshrouded in a mist of fathom\ 
Fastened to this peculiar history\ 
Longing to leave this Sanctum\ 
Lost in dizzy memories\ 
Fretting in painful ideology\ 
Lost of all energies\ 
Fretting in my own mythology\ 
Questioning the very being\ 
Wondering the very meaning\ 
Longing for the seeing\ 
Hoping for the living 
So , has anyone ever heard of someone NOT wanting to be on Varsity ? O.o

Today's world language lesson\ 
Ciao is Hello in Italian \ 
Arrivederci is Good bye in Italian\ 
I thought I should clear this up for people . 
And from the deepest corner\ 
The sickness shall extend\ 
Until it retakes that which it lost\ 
And the victim shall succumb\ 
To know its darkest darkness\ 
As a new and intimate friend\ 
Where the world shall shun it\ 
Where the victim shall despise it\ 
Where the inflictor will never know the damage\ 
Or will it ?

My first day in DC was interesting . However , I have only been further convinced that even the highest intellects have little in common with myself . * sigh * 
Room 140 , please shut up ! ; Bed 1 stop leaving your loafers in the middle of the room and you really aren't that cool ; Bed 2 when you try to text under your sheets the light is brighter and you look like an alien . 
I am the super hero of amendment writing . Woot . 
The Democratic sector of the NYLC had a \pep-rally\ " in which they reduced my IQ by informing of something called a \ " Dougie\ " and played excessively loud rap music . * sigh * " 
Researching my topic for tomorrow's general debate for our model congress meeting . Yay . 
Totally sad to be leaving DC and all the amazing people I have met here . ): <3 you guys lots !!!
