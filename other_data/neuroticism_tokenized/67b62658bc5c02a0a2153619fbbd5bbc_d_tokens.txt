Don't write your name in the sand for waves to wash away , in the sky for winds to blow away but instead in the hearts of those you touch where it forever stays ... 
When you fall , I'll do my best to pick you back up . And if i can't , then I'll just lay down right next to you . <3 
Hanging out with My Dead Fish < PROPMALE > . XD

A lot harder than I thought . You mean so much to me ... I hope you know that . 
Yesterday was bitter sweet . I loved it but at the same time it was really hard not to dislike it . I know that there will be no more days like yesterday until next week but I really don't know how to take it . Should I like the fact ... or dislike it ?

\I could stay awake just to hear you breathing\ 
Hoping everything is alright . 
You reach for the < PROPFEMALE > and never give up . You are a trooper . You do things that nobody else would ever do . I look up to you and I hope you know that . Just please , don't do something that could put you in danger . When you are in danger so am I . I'm in the danger of losing you and that's something I could never handle . 
Sometimes I forget that there is always an ending to those good times . But I never forget that there will be more good times ahead . 
\So stand in the rain \ 
\Here comes goodbye\ 
I'm bored and can't tell if i'm scared or ready for tomorrow .

Drill team , school , rifle team , home . Lovely schedule for the most part .. 
I can learn a few things from today and I hope you can too . Just make sure that next time you thing about it . <3 perfectly imperfect . I could not ask for more . I really couldn't . <3 
Plan successful . XD <3 
Plan successful times 10 . That snow just keeps looking better . I just hope that everybody stays safe and warm today . <3 
Sharing is caring . Everybody else would do it for me except you ! :'( 
Whoo ! Effin snow sucks balls ! 
Time flies by so fast . 
Home work is fun . Who wants to do some !? ;) 
Truth is ... 
School tomorrow . The only thing that I do like about that fact is at the end of the day you get that \Friday feeling\ " and I love it . haha <3 " 
A guy broke into my apartment last week .. He didn't take the TV , just the remote . Now he drives by and changes the channels .. Sick bastard .. haha 
After school will be fun . :) <3 
It's the goodbye's that make it so hard . Even though it's not goodbye forever , I just don't want to \see you later\ " ... I want to see you know and forever . " 
Don't you love when things fall together ? They always do . Things just seem to always workout . I love it . <3 
At my brothers superbowl party with my Dead Fish < PROPMALE > . XD <3 
Night 
In reality , I'm not even here . I don't know where I am but all I know is that I should be with you ... where I belong . 
... 
Tomorrow is Friday . Finally . <3 
Just shutup . All you do is bitch and whine . 
All you can do is assure them that you are always there no matter what . Pull them out of the darkness that falls around them and lift them up to shine brighter then they have ever shined before . It sounds easier than it really is but if you love them enough you will do it one way or another . Love is the faith that always finds its way . 
With my Dead Fish < PROPMALE > . XD <3 
Tomorrow = Monday . :( 
I have a feeling that this week will go by fast . Lets hope I'm right .
