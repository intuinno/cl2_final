I promise I'll add a picture when I get home . 

I'm home from my vacation to Washington D.C. It was pretty awesome . 
I'm bored w\\ facebook for now ... gonna play XBOX or RuneScape . 
is going to Owasso so < PROPMALE > can go to Best Buy . 
is going to see the new Transformers movie with his family . 
Sorry about the 2 quizzes evrybody , thought they were fitting for me . 
Is updating his status , because it's been a while since that's happened . 
is probably going to a friends house ... probably . 
had Ramen Noodles for the first time a few hours ago . 
had his teeth cleaned at the dentist today . And I didn't have any cavities . 
found a cool single-player ( but C o-o p enabled ) game for XBOX whenever his friends aren't online : Too Human . 
had Ramen Noodles to eat for I think the 3rd day in a row ... I think the seasoning has crack in it or something because it's addictive . 
is looking forward to next week . 
is gonna go hit stuff ... Rhythmically ! 
will never have another energy drink\\shot ... ever . < PROPFEMALE > Potions ( equivalent to 2,000 mg of caffeine ) are way too potent and apparently make me sick the next day ... which is today =( 
Wow ... DJ just hardcore pwned the entire enemy team a little while ago on CoD4 ... he was 60 - 9 using a < PROPFEMALE > M40 . He said he wasn't even trying ... maybe I should stop trying . 
just found out that he WON THE GUITAR HERO AEROSMITH OPENING ACT CONTEST & WILL OPEN UP FOR ZZ TOP & AEROSMITH IN CONCERT !!! This is awesome . 
I'm going off to the concert ! This is probably one of the best days of my life . 
Back from the concert . It was awesome . 
is gonna check if my Aerosmith concert video is up on YouTube yet . 
is going to go get his schedule for the s word that's about to start again in less days than I want to think of . 
* gasp * AC/DC's coming back to Oklahoma ! This time they're at the Ford Center . November 4th @ 8 PM I wonder if they can outdo their < PROPFEMALE > Center performance I saw earlier this year ... which was AWESOME I might add . 
Claremore , Oklahoma ... I predict there will be heavy metal thunderstorms here at approximately 12:40 A . M .. Maybe they can get here faster so I can sleep better . 
< PROPFIRST > + DJ = Cod4 OWNAGE . Also , we're in need of a good Team Doubles name for Gamebattles . We were gonna be Team Brutal , but it was taken . Anyone got any suggestions ? 
is doing his Senior paper over his disorder . I'm so amazed that there's stuff on the internet about it . I can't believe I'm saying this , but this is gonna be the best research project EVER . 
Day 1 of Defcon was disappointing =\\ ... now it's time to find out what day 2 will be like . 
Late update : Defcon Day 2 > than Defcon Day 1 . Vendors had cool stuff & I got to show off my Guitar Hero abilities . I came home with an airsoft P90 FTW ! 
4 Letters : ODST 
Airsoft P90 > Airsoft MP5 , Airsoft G36c , and Airsoft Uzi . I proved it tonight at DJ's house . 
Tomorrow is my Drum Recital ... and I'm excited & nervous at the same time , to be honest . I'm gonna be playing \Aliens Exist\ " by Blink-182 . 216 BPM = fun fun fun . " 
There's only 2 days of school before fall break ... but those days will last longer than ANY other days of the school year . And that's what makes them so painful . 
This has been one of the best school days I've had in a long time . Every hour had comedy in it ( ESPECIALLY lunch ) , I got a 100% on my History final , and we beat Holland Hall in Academic Bowl . I count today as an EPIC WIN . 
One last post before I stop . If anyone's interested in coming over to my house to practice the ACT ( my Uncle < PROPFIRST > will be here teaching & he made a 35 ) , then comment/send me a message/do something to say you wanna go . 
Excited for today ! 
Excited again ! BIRTHDAY PARTY FTW ! ( Not mine XD ) 
Wow . Good job , Phillies . Bottom of the 9th down 3-4 , 2 outs with runners on 1st & 2nd and < PROPFIRST > Rollins hits a triple to win it 5-4 . Totally epic . 
Also , Borderlands comes out tomorrow . It has 87 BAZILLION guns . 87 BAZILLION . And yes it's a videogame . 
Holy crap ... Borderlands is amazing . 
I won't miss 1st Hour tomorrow ! ( or is it today at this point ? ) 
I never thought I could have such a great day with such minimal videogames . 
GET ON MY LEVEL ! 
I just realized that I finally ... FINALLY . Got that song out of my head . It was trapped for over a week , and finally found a way out . 
I need to leave reality for a while . It's too frustrating & stressful for me at the moment . 
Just got back from the KISS concert . It was awesome . Tons of pyrotechnics and showiness . 
Before I crash , who thinks playing drums after midnight is a bad idea ? I'd like it . Neighbors & anyone else asleep would hate it ... I'm feeling an urge to hit stuff rhythmically while at the same time make awesome music . 
needs to clean up his double bass drum triplets . Very important for metal drumming , very difficult to make sound good . 
** ATTENTION ** Any person that has contacted me in regards to the EEMC needs to know that we will be holding a meeting immediately after school TUESDAY ( that's tomorrow ) in Room 408 ( Mr. McClaren's room ) . We will be holding elections and will be discussing dates for our first two events and what will occur in future meetings . To all else : either disregard this post or you are welcome to check out our club . 
I just found out that I've been accepted to TU . Yay me . 
< PROPMALE>'s already said that Longcat is loooooooooooooooooooooong . So I will now say that Tacgnol is gnooooooooooooooooooooooool . 
Why is everyone making their profile pics into Pokemon ... More & more of the people I see posting things are turning into a Pokemon . What's going on here o.O ?? 
Assassin's Creed : Brotherhood . Amazing game . Ending ? I have no idea what to make of it . 
Academic Team won Area . We're gonna win state next . 
Thinking about participating in the Mr. Claremore competition ... but I'm not sure what I'd play . I'd play my drums , NOT Guitar Hero . So I guess the only real question is what song & whether or not I'd solo afterwards . Any suggestions anybody ? 
No school tomorrow ... thank God . 
Fun night ... I think that our club has officially proven itself to be the most awesome club of ALL TIME . EEMC FTW 
I feel ashamed of myself ... I could've done WAY better at my drums if I could've heard the music . Meh . There was no way < PROPFIRST > wasn't going to win anyway and I had fun . Conclusion : Totally Worth It 
Just got accepted to OU . Yay ! 
Best $1 Joke/Movie ever made : The Guy With Secret Kung-Fu . Haven't watched it yet , because I'm gonna watch it with my friends . 
Thanks to all who've wished me a happy birthday ! I have to give extra thanks because it was a good one . A really good one . One of the best , actually . You get the picture =D Thanks everybody ! 
I think I gamed for like ... 10 hours yesterday . That Borderlands DLC is EPIC . Oh , and MW2 is great , too . 
Awesome party . The Guy With Secret Kung-Fu may just be the best $1 I've ever spent in my entire life . 
I think facebook is inspired by Satan ... because I swear some of these ads are absolute WITCHCRAFT . They practically read my mind . 
got a new phone . It's pretty snazzy . Not sure what its fullest capabilities are , but it sure looks cool . Oh , and I now have texting . Just a FYI if you can't call me but need to contact me for whatever reason . 
Yesterday , perfect weather . About 73 degrees or so I think . Something like that . Perfect for our band practice . Today , blizzard . I can only assume below 32 degrees . And a perfect example of Oklahoma weather . 
Visited OU & OSU today ... very good information towards my decision on where to go to college . 
* yawn * Bedtime ... 
Ka-Boom Ka-Boom ( see song by < PROPFEMALE > Manson ) ... Gonna be a good band practice today . 
Really don't wanna take the Psychology test tomorrow ... no matter how ready I get myself I'll never feel ready enough . 
You know what's awesome ? Not going to school tomorrow . Senior Skip Day FTW 
Awesome day . \ 
Didn't go to school . Played Castlevania : SOTN & some Halo 3 Team SWAT . Went to El Azteca with friends & then went & saw Iron Man 2 ( which was AWESOME ) with them . < PROPMALE > out with same friends in movie theater parking lot . Got a great MTG pack with a card I wanted inside . And opened a superawesome late birthday present . Why can't every day be this great ? 
AIRBOURNE LIVE = Best thing EVER . Opening bands were good . 1st one : meh . Glister : Great . \ 
Obtained Swag : Signed T-shirt , Signed CD , & guitar pick . \ 
Also I was showered in tons of beer . < PROPFIRST > O'Keefe smashed his head against 3 different beer cans until they sprayed everywhere . AWESOME . 
I hate essays . Especially Psychology essays . Especially 5-7 < PROPFEMALE > long Psychology essays due on Monday . Especially 5-7 < PROPFEMALE > long Psychology essays due on Monday that I've barely started on . 
I got more moneydollars ! Just got a letter from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > saying that I got the Byrd scholarship . Yay ! 
YES ! I get to get out of school at 10 tomorrow ! Oh and I graduate , too . 
To all people I've contacted regarding LaserQuest : the date has changed from FRIDAY ( June 4 ) to this SATURDAY ( June 5 ) due to a large number of people unable to make the original date . \ 
The time is 6PM , so be at my house at 5PM ( if you need my address , message me/text me ) OR be at LQ by about 6PM . It's gonna be GREAT ! \ 
If you were able to go , expect a text message giving you the new date in case you don't see this . 
< PROPFEMALE > FIRIN MY LAZOR ! 
If anyone's interested , I'm heading over to Castle today to play some MTG . You should tag along . It's gonna be fun . They even have TVs w/ game consoles & comic books if you don't care for Magic . 
I enrolled today . Beginning Russian , Calculus I , Intro to Physics ( for majors ) , and Intro to Drumset . And yes , I am amazed there's a class for drums . 
Anyone who needs to contact me via cell phone , don't bother trying . My phone ran into some water trouble and is currently sitting in a bowl of rice . Hopefully it still works . -.- 
Update on phone : now back to fully operational status . Water damage is largely gone , and good thing the battery wasn't fried . 
Got wisdom teeth out this morning . Pain & holes in mouth sucks . Chilling out & pain meds are great . 
MTG tournament tomorrow ( or should I say later today ) at Castle ! I AM NOT MISSING THIS ONE . NOTHING WILL STOP ME FROM PARTICIPATING . 
Deck worked pretty well at the tourney . Needs a little more fine-tuning , though . Good advice & criticism from some of the nerds there as well . I went 2-1 before I had to leave , so I'd consider it a good run . 
Funny video , coarse language . People who stay in hotels frequently can appreciate this . \

I just got mail from the Czech Republic today ! Yay ! 
Hope everyone's 4th of July was a good one ! Our last firework exploded on the ground . Best misfire EVER . 
Transmorphers . Robots in cognito . 
NEW LAPTOP 
Not ready to go to college in 1 week . I like it here . 
Sleeping in a new bed is not as good as sleeping in your bed at home . No matter how soft the feather bed is . 
Class starts tomorrow -.- 
Not sure what the worst part ( so far ) of college is yet . But right now I really wish I had a cat . 
It is now September . Just thought I'd point that out . 
?? ???? ??????... 
THIS IS SPARTA\

People of my facebook friends list ... gimme some songs to listen to . I want to expand the number of songs I can drum .

\OU Alert : The USGS has reported a 4.3 magnitude earthquake 6 < PROPMALE > to the east of OU < PROPFIRST > campus . No injuries reported . \"" 
THEY'RE BRINGING BACK NAZI ZOMBIES IN BLACK OPS . THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE 
Black Ops & Dead Space 2 ... Here's to looking forward to the future for two sure-to-be awesome games . 
? ????? ??? ???? 
What's everyone going to dress up as ( if you're dressing up ) on Halloween ? 
POWERTHIRST . The energy drink for people who need GRATUITOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRuNxHqwazs 
To any and all friends who will be in Claremore on Friday :\ 
My band and I will be competing in the Best and Brightest competition at the Robson PAC right next to WRJH and Claremore High . I've been told we will perform right around 3PM . \ 
So if you don't have anything to do after school ( if you're still in school ) , you can come and watch if you want ! 
BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS BLACK OPS 
just played through the ENTIRE campaign of Black Ops in one sitting . Totally worth staying up late for . 
Mono-White Lifegain seems to be a < PROPMALE > thorn in the side of everyone at Castle . Although I did go 4-0 tonight only to lose to Blue-White Control in the top 8 . Still a great night ... since I pulled KOTH 
Dreading the 5-page essay I have to do tomorrow ... or I guess technically later today . 
But not this day ... THIS DAY WE FIGHT 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! 
* ahem * Gentlemen . 
I can't believe that I haven't been sick for over a year and now my body succumbs to a minor little head cold/sinus infection/ear infection . This is so annoying ... 
I just watched the World of Warcraft and Guitar Hero episodes of South Park ... my life is complete . 
That's right . I'm participating in Pokemon picture December 
Lifegain or Artifacts . What do I play this week ? facebook friends , GO 
lol , internet 
Problem , facebook ? 
I am BACK IN TOWN !!! Skiing was great but I love sleeping in my own bed . 
School internet : Downloads at 5Mbps . 
I have now concluded that Tuesdays are now the best day of the week ( sorry bro ) . 1 hour of class from 10:30 AM- 11:20 AM and I'm DONE FOR THE DAY BABY . AWW YEAH . 
I woke up thinking I'd have to go to class . What I neglected to remember was people in Oklahoma are terrified of snow . 
Dead Space 2 comes out in 7 hours !!! 
I have played Dead Space 2 ... and it is good . 
The next Calculus assignment I get I'm going to do at the Math Help Center ... I shouldn't have to think this hard when there's games to be played XD 
OU Math Help Center is easily the best thing ever . From now on Tuesdays are math homework days and Thursday mornings no longer have to be early ! 
Fire alarm at 3AM makes < PROPFIRST > a pissed off college kid . 
MtG : Mirrodin Besieged day 2 ! \ 
Sealed tournament : unlucky pulls ( except Black Sun Zenith ) . \ 
Booster Draft : Out of 3 packs , pulled 2 mythics ( Lux Cannon & Sword of Feast & Famine ) . Did alright in this but got obliterated by a turn 3 Glissa . \ 
< PROPMALE > PROPS TO ANYBODY WHO UNDERSTOOD ANY OF THAT 
I am STUCK IN < PROPFIRST > . I suppose there are worse places to be stuck but I wanna go HOME . 
So the Packers beat the Steelers by a field goal , the Black Eyed Peas should stay in the studio , and the commercials were pretty good as I expected . 
OU will not be having school tomorrow on Wednesday . Just a preemptive strike against the 90% < PROPMALE > of ice tonight and snow tomorrow ! 
I've played way too much Guitar Hero for one man . But that's not a bad thing . I just won a 50\ plasma screen HDTV from a Guitar Hero tournament . " 
Tuesdays are the best . I have 1 class from 10:30 - 11:20 AM and if I'm really tired I can go back to my dorm and nap until I feel ready to do something again . 
At this time of February 24 , 1992 I came into this world . Now 19 years have passed . I am proud to have been blessed with such a great family who loves me so . I'm also proud of all the awesome friends I have . I am proud to call myself a part of the Strain family . I am proud to be a friend to all of you . I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done . I'm happy to be alive and 19 years old ! 
Fire alarm in early morning is bad . Fire alarm in the early morning during LoL ?? UNBEARABLE 
There are 4 questions you MUST ask before you die :\ 
Who are we ? \ 
Where do we come from ? \ 
Do you believe in God ? \ 
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT ?!?!? 
If you were to have a son/daughter , what would you name him/her ? \ 
To people who already have kids , if you were to have another child what would you want his/her name to be ? 
I pose a question to you , my friends : \ 
Is Will Ferrell funny ? 
ANOTHER POLL ! My friends , which < PROPFEMALE > Wars trilogy was better :\ 
The Original Trilogy ( Episodes 4 , 5 , & 6)\ 
The New Trilogy ( Episodes 1 , 2 , & 3 ) 
Just finished Bioshock for the second time . That game will be amazing no matter how many times I play it . 
Had an awesome time yesterday with < PROPMALE > Morningstar , < PROPFIRST > Ysk Kenrick , < PROPMALE > Strain , and my amazing girlfriend Hope Conder !
