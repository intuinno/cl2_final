I'll probably not be at school tomorrow due to this fever I've had for a while . :( 

First basketball game @ 7:30 . I'm sooooo excited/scared ! 
We lost our game , but I feel great anyways . :) 
Oh dear , I hope my castle doesn't get ripped apart by the wind tomorrow . D: 
I'll be competing in a modeling contest online ! Wish me luck ! :D 
very confused . I don't think that I'll ever understand men . Then again , I suppose that's natural . cx 
Today was a really crazy day . I need to study like crazy for Algebra II . 
Strange , I don't feel great , but I don't really have reason towards it ... or do I ? 
I feel much better . Thanks for a good talk , < PROPFEMALE > . (: 
Only 3 more questions left on my test and I'll be baby sitting next Saturday . Everything's going great ! =D 
~ I wish you were here ~ That song is stuck in my head . X ) 
I just finished a draft for my resolution . I hope that Mr. Smith likes it . =D I also hope that I'll pass my Algebra II test . ^_^ ' Mrs. Ellzey will also be getting the next chapter of my story as requested . I hope to get an awesome picture of myself tomorrow for the contest . Everything's coming together and getting better everyday ! <3 
Haha , Seinfeld's hilarious ! The show never gets old ! XD 
~ I can't wait for someone to hear me and wait for someone to touch me and wait forever to be told I'm forever alone . I can't wait for someone to feel me and wait for someone to heal me and wait forever to be told I'm forever alone ~ Being forever alone doesn't sound too appealing . 
What a crazy day , but Bible class really improved it . Thank you , Mr. B . (: 
~ Whatever tomorrow brings , I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yeah ~ 
~ Wonder if he knows , he's on my radar ~ Just got back from basketball practice . Got bunches of stuff to work on tomorrow .

Will be babysitting tomorrow from 4:30 to 12 . Yay ! (: 
0-0 I'm of the 10% of the elite groups students as a USAA National Leadership and Service Award winner . Sweetness ! :D 
Even though I know that no guy was going to ask me , I really wanted the school to have a dance . D: 
I wanna sleep for a forever and a half . 
~ Can you meet me halfway , right at the borderline ? That's where I'm gonna wait for you ~ My , what a long day . Need something to keep me sane . lol 
~ I wish I could count to ten , make everything be wonderful again ~ Need to unwind some lol . ^_^ ' 
Memories together and forgotten are better than memories alone and remembered . Time to get some homework done ! ^_^ 
Everyone in this world is truly amazing , beautiful , and unique . Praise God that I'm put in such a world . 
Haha , got to talk to < PROPFEMALE > . It was a pretty hilarious convo ! XD

~ Break away from everybody . Break away from everything . If you can't stand the way this place is , take , yourself to higher places ~ 
I feel so great after school ! Excedrin does wonders lol . (: 
~ Going through this life , looking for angels . People passing by , looking for angels . Walking down the streets , looking for angels . Everyone I meet , looking for angels ~ 
Maybe one of these days there'll be peace . Maybe one of these days we'll never go hungry . Maybe one of these days , we'll all commit our lives to God . Maybe one of these days , we should not have these as ' one of these days ' but rather today . 
I'd rather take on everyone's pain than watch other's struggle under it . 
Stressed out ... 
~ I don't want to live To waste another day Underneath the shadow of mistakes I made Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside I don't want to fall and say I lost it all ' Cause maybe there's a part of me that hit the wall Leaving pieces of me behind And I feel like I'm breaking inside ~ 
Haha , something hit my head today in our game and left a big pink bump near my < PROPFEMALE > . I wonder what hit me ... 
<3 I saw my crush today at the basketball game <3 Better yet , he'll be there tomorrow too . (: 
To anyone reading this : Please pray for me tonight . 
Haha , House is the best show ever . (: To anyone who prayed , thank you .

Dude , Algebra II was easy today ! Yay ! :D Time to work on World History essay ... 
~ The only thing that I still believe in is you . If you only knew , if you only knew . I still hold on to the letters you returned . You helped me live and learn ~

Eye examination today . I bet you they'll tell me that I'm blind as a bat . xD\ 
Can't wait for the DC trip ! :D 
Just got back from getting my hair trimmed and eye examination . My eyes have learned to see better ! xD\ 
Ordering the same pair of glasses , but these ones will transition ! ;D 
Possibly getting a job at Red Apple , but if I don't I'll be happy with babysitting this summer once there's people who need it . \ 
I'm already bored this early in summer vacation . xD 
This D.C. trip has totally been awesome . It's too bad that tomorrow is our last day with the other peeps . D; 
' Alaska Blue Eyes ' is back in Alaska !!! :D I sure miss my Missouri and Colorado people though ... D; 
Here's a funny thought : I found all the Colorado people from the trip on Facebook ( well , one of them found me and it went from there ) , but none of the Missouri people . xD 
Yay , < PROPFIRST > found me so now I'm finding all the Missouri people in a snap ! :D 
Dreams can sometimes be lovely ~ \ 
Only they make you wish they became part of reality . 
~ Going through this life , looking for angels . People passing by , looking for angels . Walking down the streets , looking for angels . Everyone I meet , looking for angels ~ \ 
Hm ... I think I've found almost everyone from the D.C. trip . Kaytilin , where are you ?! xD 
Hey guys , if it's not too much trouble , could you pray for my mom ? She's been having a really rough time with her fourth round of the chemotherapy . 
I'm sick and tired of trying to get a full photo of myself by myself without : being whited out , looking bad in the picture , not completely being in the picture . >:/ 
Finally done taking pictures for my two modeling contests . Now to wait and see if I make it to the next round ~ \ 
~ * ~ KAHHF ~ * ~ 
~ I have found all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again ~ \ 
Really need to make some money . My I-pod's been lost since school and I'm sick of hearing Drakenguard's battle music after slaying soldiers for countless of hours . :/ 
WOOT ! I got first in the first round of one of the modeling contests and 3rd in the other first round . \ 
I'm at a great start ! I'll post the pictures with the round themes included . :3 
Got my new pair of glasses . Gosh , now I can read street signs from farther away . xD It feels weird to have to squint less . \ 
And yay for a strawberry smoothie with a new manga to read ! :D 
R . I . P - Alustrial my two ( almost three ) year old betta . Died yesterday . \ 
I don't want to get a cup and flush him . D; 
~ I'll set You as seal upon my heart ; as a seal on my arm . For there is love as strong as death ... Come be the fire inside of me ~ \ 
My fish is gone and the tank's clean . Thinking of a name for my new betta when I go buy one . 
~ KAHHF ~ \ 
Boredomness ... Need to wait for the next round of my modeling contests for something to do ... :/ 
What is < PROPFIRST > from Seinfeld doing on a ASPCA comercial ? xD 
To my Dad , Happy Father's Day ! <3 \ 
And to all other fathers out there as well ! ;D 
Two lessons learned today in cooking dinner :\

As my sister said ( but a bit different ) , \Everyone's poo smells the same and I'm sure that their's doesn't smell like roses either . \"" 
Woo , hanging out with Liezel was awesome ! ;D <3

The parade was great ! \ 
I'm so tired now . xD 
I'll be getting my ipod touch today . :D <3 \ 
Anyone know of some great apps ? 
Tap Tap Revenge 3 ~ ;D \ 
My sister won't let me know the password to the internet so I can't use the internet on my ipod . D; 
I'm at < PROPFEMALE>'s!!! ^/_\\^ 
Hat + having to be inspired by tango dancing + not being able to dress like a dancer in any shape or form + nonsunny day + no person to take my photos = Disaster . :/ 
Please pray for my dad . He's in the hospital and they don't know what he has . 
My dad only had a reaction to the medicine he was taking and he's on his way home now . Everything's going to be okay for him . \ 
Thank you all for caring ! <3 
~ I wanted to see ; you shouldn't suffer this way . I wanted to see ; I hope I can take it away ~ \ 
It makes me feel so blessed when people care enough about me to call . Also , I love that just by meeting new people , they care enough to comfort me and be there for me when they know nothing of me at all . 
First again in one of the modeling contests ~ \ 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > for taking awesome photos ! <3 
I got 5th in the current round of the contest that's very picky . \ 
The next challenge is a lotion ad and I have to show as much skin as possible ( or as much as I prefer anyways ... ) , but it has to follow PG-13 standards . Oh boy .... ~ 
What'd I give to have school come sooner ~ \ 
A whole lot currently . xD 
At Liezel's house ! <3 Haha , The Proposal's the best ! XD

Haha ... ha ... Guess what I found today ? My ipod nano . xD 
Wow , now I know I'm confused when I'm wondering if it's possible for a guy to be able to PMS . 
Gosh , it's really freaky when you have a dream that you're working at McDonalds and the people that you're working for are from MUN . 0-0 ' Just ... WHAT DID I EAT ?! 
Anime and manga everyday till school . Yep , I think I can handle this . (: 
My manga box from Amazon came in and my sister took me shopping at Value Village . Ah , I must say that today went well ~ (: 
It feels so good to go back to the school ; it's like a second home to me . (: 
I just finished writing ~ My Beloved ~ ! A grand total of 160 pages . (: \ 
And , I'm already 70 pages ( according to my handwritten format ) into my other story ! 
I got third in this round of the picky modeling contest . Of course , all the judges love my polka < PROPFEMALE > jacket ! xD 
~ I feel it's going to rain like this for days . So let it rain down and wash everything away . I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine . Let every tomorrow come another life ~ \ 
Yay for the frist day of school going well . :D But ... four hours of sleep barely keeps you alive in some classes . x_x ' 
Alright , time to work on essay questions ... ^^'

Hm ... I wonder what this coming week will be like ... The possibilities are endless . 
Pride and Prejudice , an amazing play ! <3 I got the last ticket available for tonight's show ~ \ 
Apparently , I am like < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ( or was it < PROPFEMALE >?) . If the first is true , then surely I have not met my Mr. < PROPFEMALE > . xD 
Wow , isotopic notation , electron configuration , orbital notation , quantum numbers ... I think my brain already exploded . Time to study , study , study for that test ~ 
~ Words of those that still despise me ; thinks it's eating me , you're dreaming ... I've been leaving thoughts below ; Still I feel I should know ~ \ 
Hm ... I think my bedroom and I have a love/hate relationship . xD\ 
Can't wait for tomorrow !!! <3 
~ More love , more power , more of you in my life , Jesus ~ \ 
Today I went into my Dad's truck after school and I noticed something as I looked into the shade mirror . My cheeks had a blush that went around my face , like hands were on them . I did feel my cheeks burning there during worship too . Must've been touched ~ (: 
Over at vagabonds getting coffee . :) \ 
Gosh , I hope that I do okay on my precal test ... >_>' 
I got a new purse !!! :D 
Resident Evil 5 : Why , oh why , does a vest take up space in your body storage ... thing ? Seriously , if anything , the vest should give you more pockets to put in more things ~ \ 
And me and alligators are officially not friends . -_-' 
~ You sound so innocent , all full of good intent ; Swear you know best ... You got the tal < PROPMALE > down , just not the listening . And who cares if you disagree ? You are not me ; Who made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? ~ \ 
Today feels like a Resident Evil day . xD Oh well , time to write more for my report on GW . 
~ Lead me to the cross where your love poured out , bring me to my knees , Lord , I lay me down ~ \ 
Went to church today . It's been a while since I've been able to go and I feel that I've totally missed out all these Sundays I've been unable to go . Lets hope that this won't be the last . (: 
WOOT !!! I got 1st again in the picky modeling contest !!! \you look classically beautiful and you have a definite emphasis on your jewelry . These are the only things we got that actually look like beauty shots . \ " \ 
Wow , for no reason at all , the ideas for my final round ( which requires 5 photos for three different things ( 15 in all )) have just popped up in my brain . I'm excited to get this done ! Hopefully tomorrow I can do my couture posing ~ (: 
~ Where did I go wrong ; I've lost a friend . Somewhere along in the bitterness and would I have stayed up with you all night had I known how to save a life ~ \ 
Nothing says love like < PROPMALE > P . Worrell , Resident Evil , music , and no school to worry about the next day . <3 
A writer who only types their stories should be called a typer since they are writing nothing . 
Well , yesterday was interesting . xD 
Why is it that I feel like I've sold a bit of my soul and yet feel so happy and free at the same time ? 
I got the results for the Halloween round of the modeling contest ( finally ! :D ) and got 1st again ! <3 Now , lets see how the results to the final round turn out . Cross your fingers ! xD 
Wow , I'm tired in more ways than one . \ 
Well , least there's only 4 more days of school and then ... Christmas Break ! ~ :D 
Hmm ... My purfume bottle broke in my purse , got nearly blown over by the wind as I walked to the library , basically left two blanks on a precal test , and I'm getting hip flexors today . Wonder what's next ... xD 
Strangely , iced water does a lot in keeping you awake . XD 
Well , yesterday was a lot of fun , but this morning I can't help but to feel a sense of melacholy . 
I'm totally proud of myself . I had my first hamburger at a fast food restaurant today . And ... They taste amazing . x 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !!!! <3 
\Be even-tempered 
Mass Effect 2 , how I love you ! <3 However , how I do not love it when the comrad you want to speak to doesn't feel like talking . :( 
~ I ain’t gonna stress ;\ 
Cause the worst ain’t happened yet ;\ 
Somethings watching over me ;\ 
Like Sweet Serendipity ~ \

My event list for this weekend : coupon books , making dinner , breast cancer report , book analysis report revision , and PreCal . Fun stuff ... Oh well , least I got to play Dance Central ( which was awesome !!! <3 ) and will soon be playing Mass Effect 2 . (: 
~ Hey now , this is my desire : consume me like a fire cause I just want something beautiful to touch me . I know that I'm in reach cause I am down on my knees waiting for something beautiful ~ \ 
Hm , not quite sure what to say about today , but I'm glad that I've been having fairly good days lately ~ 
Hm ... I'm bored right now and need to make my brain work ~ \ 
Like my status and I'll say something I like about you . :3 
Hm ... MUN is soon . Pray that I do well ! :3 
< PROPFIRST > 24:35 - heaven and earth will pass away , but my word will never pass away . \ 
It was just a verse I randomly thought of for right now ~
