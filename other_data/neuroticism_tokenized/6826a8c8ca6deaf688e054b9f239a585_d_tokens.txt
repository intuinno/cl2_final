I realize that the mosque at ground zero is a hot topic with the argument of religious freedom . However , whatabout the Greek Orthodox Church that was destroyed on 911 and was therefore there prior to 911 ? What about the fact that that church has been denied the right to rebuild their building on ground zero ? Where's the religious freedom in that ? 
Got a new job and hopefully served my last table ever last night ! Woohoo !!
