fools you do not know , silence like a cancer grows .... i am going to be apart of that cancer until someone scrapes me off from the world may the color i have left keep me barely in solitude , but only just as the storm is coming for i can see the lightning and hear the westwinds . may i join the water to its holy stone carved in runes and graves , may it provide sanctuary and prosperity while i diminish as my color fades

There are in fact guys that :\ 
Like you for your personality\ 
Gaze into your eyes , not down ur shirt\ 
Dont want sex\ 
Dont care if you ' look like crap ' , but still appreciate when you put a lot of effort into getting ready\ 
... Want you to be happy , nothing more , and will do anything to make it happen\ 
Care for you more than you do\ 
All guys mess up , its part of life\ 
The difference is : some learn from their mistakes
