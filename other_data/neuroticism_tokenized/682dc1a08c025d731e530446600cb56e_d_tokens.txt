definitely had to do the booty dance after that victory . It was ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS 
got viciously assaulted by Sahara ' Shibalba ' < PROPFIRST > ' s boob critter . D=

Right now , it feels like everything in my life is just falling apart on me . My car is broken , my laptop sporadically decides when/ when not to open my webrowsers , and my phone randomly re-calibrates the touch screen when I'm texting ; the calibration is so retarded , it's physically impossible for me to even go to the settings to attempt to change it . 
Justice without power is empty ; but power without justice is violence . 
' s cell phone's touch screen stopped working . Everything just keeps on getting better and better 
wants to play monster < PROPMALE > tri online , but none of my friends are on D: 
has been playing Monster < PROPMALE > sice 12pm . . . That can't be healthy 
is still playing Monster < PROPMALE > -_- 
is always in some financial crisis ; I'm about ready to kill someone 
had fun chillin with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and playing < PROPFEMALE > =] 
the new pokemon legendaries don't look too appealing . . . . 
logged around 87 hours in MH3 ; 18 of which was put in last wed . That doesn't even count all the times I restarted my wii out of frustration of losing to the same monster over and over 
\ . . . Some guy flies a boat off of a plane . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Clark\ 
today would have been a great day to stay home . I wish I knew that before I left 
tomorrow is my last free day for the next 3 weeks . anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > out ? 
I used to eat at < PROPFIRST > D's; now I'm eatin MREs 
Man , these two Sgts were about to fight , us privates were caught in the middle , and now two of my fingers are cut . Today could be going better 
so I decieded to try and talk to my dad for the first time sice I moved out back in Feb , and I get a text back saying , \who is this ? \ " \ 
anyone wanna go to busch gardens on wed ? 
just got done shooting a grenade launcher . Fun stuff 
It is too fucking hot to go the next 11 days with no AC 
Is at busch gardens all day . still want friends here though 
microsoft and sony , you dissapoint . Nintendo pimped that shit 
Used to have trouble falling asleep . Now , I need help staying awake 
the 25th is so close , yet so far away . very far away 
when I get back , I wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with everyone . That'd be awesome . 
' s First Sergeant has been making Leeroy Jenkins references all day . 
it feels so good to be home . . . I don't wanna go back 
watched Toy Story 3 twice . Curse you < PROPFEMALE > 
where the fuck is my guitar tuner ? 
Black and White have 3-on-3 battles . Really ? 2-on-2 was complicated enough 
as a martial artist , I must say that this Karate Kid was actually really good . 
to anyone who wants to take martial arts seriously : I need someone to train with . Also , if anyone is free Sunday , I can take six people to < PROPMALE>'s Dominion for $34 per ticket . 
so yeah , I'm free this weekend . 
it feels great outside . I'll probably go for a midnight run 
note to self : think things through 
< PROPFEMALE>'s mom : \Bart 
what am I doing this 4th of July ? Gaming marathon . 
I'm pretty sure the fireworks would look better if I had someone to watch them with 
got pulled over today . Not for bad driving , but for not having a state inspection sticker on my car . The worst part : I missed breakfast at BK . 
What's for dinner ? Rice and water . I feel like I'm in North Korea or something 
sold my DS . I'm hurtin for money that bad . 
fuck woodbridge , I'm going to Minnesota . Bbl 
< PROPMALE>'s words of wisdom : Never drive to/ from downtown Minneapolis if you're the only driver . Especially if you can't afford a hotel 
does not need/ want to know why Sahara ' Shibalba ' < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > N . < PROPMALE > are locked in a bedroom together 
is starting to think his PS3 has to go . . . . 
my laptop refuses to charge ; it's only a matter of time before it dies completely . 
so I was playing yugioh on my DS and beat a \Demonic Roaring God\ " deck . I got 666 points for it . " 
Honestly , why do I bother ? 
-$200 in my account , in the process of losing my car , phone barely works , and yet I remain calm . That can't be good . . . 
is finding Japanese a lot easier to pick up than Korean 
Today was definitely a trip down memory < PROPFIRST > . It never ceases to amaze me how people never fail to tell me that I've changed . 
I forgot how to be lazy for a second . Scariest moment of my life . 
finds it funny how all the spanish girls call eachother crazy . I find it scary that none of them disagree . 
ATTENTION : If you are going to Otakon , bring me back a triangle hat and a fu-man-chu . I'll pay you back\ 
:] 
so I have a really awesome electronic drumset , but I have no speakers/ headphones to plug into it . FML 
has no days off of work next week . You better believe I'm showing up late/ leaving early/ taking long breaks every fucking day . 
- insert update here -

just got done watching all 5 seasons of Teen Titans and the movie .

so yeah , idk why I'm filling out this application . I'm pretty sure there's a %135 I'm not getting hired . . . 
OMGOMGOMGOMG , MLG PRO CIRCUIT IS GOING TO BE IN DC OCT 15-17 !!!! 
k all my yugioh friends , wtf is up with this format ? 
even though today started off bad , it was actually pretty good . Time to go learn stuff and go for a midnight run later . 
scratch the midnight run ; my ankle is still messed up 
found out that he has $900+ in bills that he has yet to pay . Fml 
must learn Japanese . . . can't give up . . . 
moonwalking at Super Q Mart is more awkward than fun 
k , all of the Yugioh 5Ds abridged series I've seen suck balls . Who wants to help me make a good one ? 
OMGOMGOMG , I HAVE AN INTERVIEW AT GAMESTOP TOMORROW !!! \ 
:D :D :D :D :D 
I'm pretty happy that Cash Cash did the theme song for Sonic Colors , but I miss Crush 40 . 
so I'm on yahoo reading \6 dating rules to ditch\ " . Rule #4 : Only date one person at a time . \ 
Apparently today was my last day at Super Q Mart ! This must be how the < PROPFEMALE > felt at the end of Aladdin when he was freed . \ 
:D 
put windows 7 on his laptop . Now I have to re-install everything . \ 
-_- 
so I went to court today to get a hard copy of my license . It expires in one month . Wtf 
is furious that one of the most interesting stories I've ever read has no conclusion atm ! \ 
D:<

I love gamefreak\

Had a BLAST today ! 
working at gamestop is so . . . . AWESOME ! 
just a friendly reminder : my phone is broken . 
oh snap , Black and White got a perfect score from Famitsu . These games have to be freaking amazing 
so I definitely want a game tower for my wii , but the thing only holds 20 games and I have like 9768748989726455698129462436295875648 wii games . 
wtf , why does the National Guard always feel the need to pair me with the Sgt that hates my guts ? 
has failed every PT test since June . I wish the Army would just kick me out already 
of all the games coming out this holiday season , I pre-ordered Sonic Colors . Why ? Because it comes with a really dorky Sonic hat . The game itself looks pretty good too , but I really wanted the hat . 
totally forgot that my boss gave me a beta code for a closed beta . I love my job\ 
Dear Nintendo , \ 
Stop making Water Temples . Nobody likes them . 
I'm gonna reach for the stars , although they look pretty far . . . . 
k , remember when I was all iffy about the 5th gen pokemon starters ? Fuck that , the fire's final evolution looks like Ganon in pig form . ME WANT 
OMGOMGOMGOMG , ALL THE NEW POKEMON ARE REVEALED ! 
just got done beating the mess out of Red Steel 2 . Definitely a good game . 
finds it sad that I enjoy being at work more than being at home 
downloaded a rom for pokemon black and white . You will probably never see me again , goodbye . 
Thank you everyone for your support of my new ' Ask PyroTakun ' segment on youtube ! I got a grand total of 2 questions , 1 of which was practically involuntary . \ 
Honestly , WTF PEOPLE . 111 friends , 2 people helpin me out ? Really ? That's some bullshit .

\I'm really bad

computer is dying and refusing to charge ; if you have something to say , say it now ! 
K , so thanks to the Bible , I managed to get my laptop to charge again . No joke 
K , so I'm 20 years old . I've never been drunk , never been high , never got laid . Wtf have I been doing my whole life ? Oh yeah , video games . \ 
\ 
Thanks for the birthday wishes , everyone ! :]

blame it on the pop 
so yeah . . . who wants cake ? 
would really like to < PROPFEMALE > out with friends today , but you guys make it pretty damn hard 
Anyone who is free Thursday should totally come to < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant and watch me do open-mic stand up ! 
I haven't even been awake for 3 hours and I can already tell it's one of ' those ' days . I think I wanna just go back to sleep 
is going to be doing open-mic stand up at < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant tonight at 9 ! It's free to get in , come out and enjoy the show ! 
Off to drill now 
Aside from driving , all I have done so far is play Kingdom Hearts . Why do they even make me go to drill ? 
I have no fucking clue where I'm gonna live 
today marks the 25th anniversary of the release of the NES . Even in times like this , Nintendo still puts a smile on my face :) 
is having a blast playing < PROPFIRST>'s Epic Yarn with Sahara ' Shibalba ' < PROPFIRST > 
did fb chat crash , or is it just me ? 
I'm gonna find my own way and take a < PROPMALE > on today 
beat < PROPFIRST>'s Epic Yarn with Sahara ' Shibalba ' < PROPFIRST > last night . The game was AWESOME , and anyone that has a Wii should definitely play the game 
K , so I'm being kicked out of this house in like a week . I should be looking for a place to live , another job , practicing my stand-up for tomorrow night , or anything else productive . What am I doing ? Learning songs on my Ukulele . \ 
Priorities : I have none . 
so feel free to come see me at < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant tonight at 9 . I still don't know wth I'm gonna say , but it'll probably be funny . Hopefully . Most likely . No guarantees . 
overslept , omw to pick people up , then open-mic at < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant . 
Sahara ' Shibalba ' < PROPFIRST > and I are the worst babysitters ever . \ 
Me : \Omg 
so apparently I'm being kicked out today as opposed to Thursday . Who knew ? 
is going to be doing stand up at < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant . Or I'm gonna stab somebody . Either way , it'll be entertaining and you should definitely go . 
Sitting alone , I remember why I'm single 
FUCK MY LIFE . THAT IS ALL 
Goldeneye is AWESOME ! \ 
I really hate it when I want to talk to someone but have nothing to say 
just remembered why I don't play FPS games . 
Wtf , now I'm being kicked out of this house too ? This shit is getting ridiculous . 
?!?!?! \ 
Where did this blood come from ???? 
just got back from the CoD : Black Ops midnight release . Fun stuff 
I'm callin all the time ; I know I interrupt , but it hurts when all I hear is you hanging up . 
My laptop died , my cell phone is going to be cut off any minute , and I'm being kicked out in an indefinite period of time . I guess this is goodbye . . . . 
Is officially homeless . Happy veteran's day . 
I just wanna be free from the confines of gravity 
I officially vote < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs the World as the best movie ever 
is about to play the mess out of DKCR with < PROPFIRST > Hess ! \ 
>:D 
so apparently I'll be spending Thanksgiving by myself with practically nothing to eat . Isn't that the exact opposite of how you're supposed to celebrate it ? 
Thanks to everyone who wished me a Happy Thanksgiving . ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , Uyeda < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > Miah . ) Also thanks to < PROPFIRST > Jet Stratton , < PROPFEMALE > Gaskin , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > for being awesome ! \ 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! 
so I'm watching the < PROPFEMALE>'s Fashion show with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and she keeps making comments about the outfits . . . I'm not watching this show for the outfits . 
at this point , I'm more trouble than I'm worth 
Funny how I probably played more pokemon than all of you combined , but I went with a DBZ pic . 
\You're only half important . You're import . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > " 
Dear video game companies , \ 
Where the hell are my RPGs ? \

There's nowhere to fall once you reach the bottom 
If my life gets any worse , I'm pretty sure I'll die . 
Dear Everyone , \ 
I know it's the holiday season , but that does not give you the right to drive like you're playing < PROPFIRST > Kart . \ 
Sincerely , \

I'm immature , but I'll stay that way forever 
\I can't even imagine shoving that in there . \ " < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > \

every night it gets harder for me to sleep . . . 
So I took one of those blood tests and got an A+\ 
I didn't even study :D 
Just discovered the web-browser version of Plants Vs Zombies . I think I know what I'm doing for the rest of the night . . . 
Heads up to all of my pokemon friends , when I get all 649 pokemon and 5 stars on my trainer card , I'm having a big-ass pokemon party , and you better be there 
Dear pedestrian , \ 
I will not hesitate to run you over just because you're white . \ 
so whenever I post a status on fb , I keep forgetting that I am friends with several moms , and they might actually read my statuses . 
Black Eyed Peas should never leave the studio . . . They sound terrible live 
Conker's Bad Fur Day on the N64 is a great game to play ; even by today's standards 
It's kinda sad how more people talk to me on youtube than fb . 
So , tomorrow is < PROPFIRST>'s Day . . . Too bad I don't have a < PROPFIRST > 
It sure is lonely without < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > here . . . . 
It's the official 25th anniversary for the Legend of < PROPFEMALE > ! One of gaming's best franchises EVER ! \

That's it , the DS is staying with me at ALL TIMES now . \

Knowing you have to do it agin . FML 
so the pokedex classification for Embroar is \Mega Fire Pig Pokemon\ " \ 
Holy crap , I don't have work today ! I think I'm gonna work out for a bit and then play the mess out of Pokemon Black version 
Nintendo and Sony are both contrubuting $3.6 million to help recover from the earthquake and tsunami . Sega is right behind them with $2.4 million and Namco-Bandai is donating $1.2 million . \

So , Nintendo confirmed that \Project Cafe\ " is real and will be revealed at E3 this year . Is it June yet ? " 
The hatred for the hacker community is beyond ridiculous , most of the hate comes from people who don't even know what hacking really is . Words for the wise : Don't judge what you don't understand
