im in skizool and my teacher has said the word \okay\ " 56 times in an hour . nice " 

i miss my lover and i have to take a history test in approximately 15 minutes . please let me be in your thoughts and wish me the best of luck . =) 
Hmmm ... i think if i keep feeling a cornucopia of emotions at once i am liable to spontaneously combust . 
lol . i wonder how many people have been on facebook , while on the potty :) 
it may be bruised and broken , but it's all that i have . \ 
this smile will stay , if you love who i am . \ 
and just one more thing ? \ 
promise you won't leave & hearts ; 
You're trying to reshape me in a moment\ 
In the image of someone you used to know\ 
I won't be a stand-in for an old love\ 
Take me as I am or let me go . 
Maybe one day you will know how hard it is for me to show my heart And all the love running through my soul Maybe one day you will know 
don't ever have high hopes , because it will only be met with a solid punch in the stomach of disappointment 
don't ever have high hopes , because it will only be met with a solid punch in the stomach of disappointment .... and then the sweetest kiss you've ever known . 
if i need some other kind of love , give me more than i can stand . \ 
and when my smile gets old and faded , wait around i'll smile again . \ 
shouldn't be so complicated , just hold me and then\ 
just hold me again & hearts ; 
yumm 
spontaneous heart palpitations , increased blood pressure , slight hyperventilation , and tingly fingers .... maybe love isn't good for my health & hearts ; 
That's when you know you've found somebody special . When you can just shut up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence . 
There are only two things in life that matter : \ 
having happiness in your life\ 
&& bringing others happiness . & hearts ; 
=) dude . don't smile like that . 
give me something nice so it can calm my chest peace and talk about these things that we really don't need . \ 
\ 
Now as I lay in bed , in my head I'm running circles stuck in the land of low light and infomercials . 
kill the lights\ 
these children learn from cigarette burns\ 
fast cars , fast women and cheap drinks\ 
it feels right\ 
all these asphyxiated , self-medicated\ 
take the white pill , you'll feel alright . 
don't have expectations . you will only be met with disappointment repeatedly . 
it feels like i'm running on the walls\ 
and i don't want to touch the ground\ 
if they say that i'm lost , \ 
then i don't want to be found . 
do you ever see someone you haven't seen in forever , and think to yourself : why ? 
Memories fade \ 
Like looking through a fogged mirror\ 
Decisions are made and not bought\ 
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot\ 
I guess not 
a text kept me really happy for about , oh , 15 minutes . but i still miss you like crazy =( 
dear facebook , \ 
i can no longer visit you , because you think i like miley < PROPMALE > . \ 
i hate you forever . 
dear facebook , i forgave you for thinking i like miley cyrus ... however , i can't forgive you for thinking i would ever like < PROPFIRST > beiber . = 0 
Put your circuits in the sea\ 
This is what the world is for\ 
Making electricity\ 
You can feel it in your mind\ 
Oh you can do it all the time\ 
Plug it in and change the world 
i love nothing but my pillow , because its always been there for me & hearts ; 
gets tired of always taking the high road . Sometimes , I'd really rather just punch you in the face . 
=) 
im not accident prone , im just uniquely coordinated to walk in to things , and fall on stuff . 
i like it on the floor 
i was bored so i got on facebook . now i'm even more bored and can't accomplish anything productive . 
i just realized OK is a sideways person =) 
Is this a natural feeling\ 
Or is it just me bleeding\ 
All my thoughts and dreams\ 
In hope that you will be with me or\ 
Is this a moment to remember\ 
Or just a cold day in December ? 
isn't liking facebook on facebook just a little redundant ? 
it's crazy to love someone who hurts you . and it's even crazier to think someone who hurts you loves you .... but i love you anyways and i can't stop . 
was told that if i couldn't say anything nice i shouldn't say anything at all .. if i stop talking to you , you now know why . 
From the depths of my soul , \ 
I feel so out of control . \ 
Jumping into crazy relations , \ 
that function on communication 
lol what do you say to a four year old when you hand him a bowl of ice cream and he replies , \try again . not enuff . \ " ?? " 
when will you learn to make me a priority ? eventually i wont be an option . 
Sometimes I want to copy someone's status word for word , to see if they notice . 
.... but you can never leave !!!!!!! 
im going to apologize in advance for anything i do today that you might find offensive . im extremely irritated , please proceed with extreme caution ... 
oh yeah . leave it to a four year old to know an answer i dont . what an ego boost . 
oooh no ! my laptop is dyiiiinnnng !!! and i forgot my power cord . =( 
I'm just pretending perfection\ 
I'm flying uncomfortably high\ 
It feels like I'm falling 
Like my status and I will tell you : 1 . Something I learned about you from\ 
looking at your wall 2 . The color you remind me of 3 . My first memory\ 
of you 4 . The animal you remind me of 5 . Ask something I've always\ 
wondered about you 6 . My favorite thing about you 7 . Give you a\ 
... nickname ... 8 . I challenge you to repost this 
im sick of being disappointed ... but i cant force myself to stop caring =( 
im sad . hit me up if you got my number =( 
Push my face in the pillow to asphyxiate the sound , \ 
I'd cry my self to sleep but I'm too scared that I might drown . 
< PROPFEMALE > tornado siren is going off ... maybe i should do something ? 
It's in the audio , it's in the air , it's in the way you move\ 
It's everywhere , it's something beautiful , that you don't know\ 
So feel the audio , and let it go 
ooo i hate you facebook . why do you give me useless information about things that have nothing to do with anything ? 
Amazing how life turns out the way that it does\ 
We end up hurting the worst , the only ones we really love ... \ 
when will you notice ? 
love is just an excuse to get hurt . 
& hearts ; 
??? (?_?) ??? woah . woah woah woah woah . not cool . 
You are my reason , my one and only that I've been living for\ 
why can't forever be forever and nothing more . 
i thought i was smiling for no reason , but then i realized i was thinking about you . & hearts ; 
(???) WHAAAAAT ?!?!?!? 
I have no space , no room to move around\ 
And this box is getting smaller\ 
I'm trying to get out 
out of all the girls in the world , im amazed every day that you chose me ... and you still love me even if i am weird =) 
I'm met a girl\ 
She's super cool\ 
I'm signing autographs\ 
She writes at school\ 
She's taking photographs that make me wanna drool 
Well , I don't know , but I've been told , \ 
You never slow down , you never grow old . \ 
I'm tired of screwin ' up , tired of going down , \ 
Tired of myself , tired of this town . ? < PROPMALE > petty i love you . 
You were meant to live life in relationship with other people , to know \ 
and be known . You need to know that your life matters . TWLOHA&hearts ; 
iloveyou . & hearts ; \ 
just sayin . =) 
AWESOME start to the day ... im cool enough to slip on only the last step of my stairs hard enough to hit my neck , shoulder and back and just in general fall on my ass . = C 
watchin a movie with the bf&hearts ; well not really . im watching a movie , he's killing zombies next to me =) 
yay . i woke up at seven on accident this morning&thats really unfortunate because i have to work at ten and wont be done till 4 = C so im going to do the mature thing and be grumpy and whine about it til im home in bed . 
Work ! how dare you interrupt my sleep schedule . i am being forced to hate you forever . you messed with Saturday sleep in . (?_?) 
sometimes , when im not paying attention ... life really sneaks up and scares the crap outta me . but it happens =) 
Always knew what I was feeling\ 
Stay tonight don't leave me reminiscing\ 
All I do is wind up missing you\ 
Are you missing me&hearts ; under the sun 
WTF are you thinking itunes ? why arent you playing my music .. i know its early but i NEED TO HEAR MY MUSIC !!!! 
i think a solo mission to Bandemer might be the therapeutic boost i need before work ... 
omg . i just found this huge gross bruise on my leg . how does a person get a bruise like that and not know where it came from ?!?!?! im blaming aliens . 
blastin the bass , tryin to get myself pumped before i go to work ... nobody wants a grumpy coworker =) so this song is for you guys 
I don't know if I've ever been good enough\ 
I'm a little bit < PROPMALE > , and I think my head is caving in , \ 
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved , \ 
By a hand that's touched me , \ 
And I feel like something's gonna give , \ 
And I'm a little bit angry . 
nothing like the most EPIC slippers ever , sunchips and this big ol bean bag . 
so im thinking im not cut out for this whole \work\ " thing . unless there is a job out there to look cool while listening to music . " 
so maybe its not a big deal , but its been 8 months&hearts ; 
he must be crazy if he thought i would get out of bed for anything at 7 am . i am dedicated to my sleep , and i will get some . 
They were there when nobody cared\ 
Are you missing me&hearts ; 
I better find a way to cross my fingers\ 
half the luck'll get me twice as far\ 
I'm sick and tired of coming up for air\ 
it shouldn't be this hard 
sometimes , i want to be really immature and turn to you and just say , \you're a jerkface doodoo head . \"" 
dear snow , \ 
this really isn't working out for me . and to be honest i've found someone else . hes warm and likes to cuddle . his name is blanket , and im never comin ' back . & hearts ; b . 
FML =( i forgot what its like to not have a car . this sucks .... 
if you dream that something bad is going to happen , do you think it will ? 
so , i hate you ( WITH A PASSION ) . i would really like for you to disappear off of the face of the earth any time now . much appreciated . 
fml . WHY does it have to be when im in a good mood , EVERYTHING goes wrong and nothing works out ? 
The water is warm\ 
But it's sending me shivers\ 
The memories fade\ 
had fun today making cookies with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , out to dinner with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and miss jennifer ... and ice skating on my new skates =) time for tv and pj's . & hearts ; 
There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love . ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr 
im excited for my jellyfish to start swimming =) its going to be so cool . 
dear < PROPFEMALE > , just wanted to say thank you for all the christmas miracles . however , i do not appreciate my car breaking and leaking gas all over the pretty snow . is there any way you could take it back and fix my car ? thanks . b&hearts ; 
i wish i could redo yesterday's fun , instead of trudging through today . 
yay for soft boots , and christmas ice skates ! love you guys ... thanks for a great holiday =) 
woot woot ! 100% on my first statistics practice quiz without studying ! yay for me =) 
I would die for you , But you won’t do the same . If my body was on fire , you would watch me burn down in flames ... & hearts ; 
what . the . fuck . 
i hate that the only thing i can depend on you for is disappointment ... and there isn't one song in my music library strong enough to make this go away . 
My life has changed , And I am not the same\ 
I come around but since I'm down , It feels uncomfortable\ 
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional\ 
I never learned to hold it in , I get emotional\ 
First , Implode and then explode\ 
I am combustible 
so even though the zodiac calendar has changed , i still have to be a < PROPFIRST > . im not happy about this parke kunkle . 
This sensations overwhelming , \ 
Give me a long kiss goodnight , \ 
And everything will be alright , \ 
Tell me that I won't feel a thing\ 
So , give me novacaine 
im SO over being sick . if i sleep as well as last night im not going to do so hot at work tomorrow . anyone want to cover my shift ? 4- midnight =) 
I am in a surprisingly spectacular mood . Im just wondering what it will take to bring me down , as this always happens . but im hoping for the best =D 
true love : waking up at 5:30 to drive my boyfriend 20 minutes to work , when I have the day off . \ 
and to the driver who was going ten under the speed limit because of the snow ? you have a hummer . i think you could climb a mountain covered in snow , so stop pissing me off & do the speed limit ... and if you brake check me again , i will be very tempted to hit you . 
rollin balls I'm elated and going dumb now\ 
drinkin liquor I'm faded and having fun now\ 
loaded gun and I'm trippin with everyone around\ 
keep me stuck in the sky i never wanna come down&hearts ; 
woah . that really happened ? i cant believe it . 
How come the only way to know\ 
How high you get me\ 
Is to see how far I fall \ 
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me\ 
But I can't break through it all&hearts ; 
It's weird when someone you least expect to care , does . And the one that should care the most , doesn't at all . 
why doesn't anything ever work out the way I want it to ? 
my statistics class has a terribly adverse affect on my brain . it hurts . 
it might be a little chilly out today , but I'm going to Bandemer anyways with < PROPMALE > Gerardi before I have to go to work at 8 . sounds like a great day =) 
i just got new music , gunna turn it up loud so I can get ready for work . but i dont have any plans for after work , so anybody wanna chill hit me up&hearts ; 
so this person failed to yield at this roundabout and almost ran right in to me . i feel like going san < PROPMALE > on them in the worst way =( 
i give up ..... not on you , just the hope that you will ever change . 
Sometimes your heart has expectations you don't even realize until the reality of disappointment crushes you completely ... 
I'm as blind as a fool can be\ 
You stole my heart , but I love you anyway 
coolest boyfriend in the world : < PROPMALE > Gerardi . Why ? because he bought me sunchips AND fruity pebbles . & hearts ; he gets me ... 
Tired of myself , tired of this town ... 
=( life is never fair . 
it's a little strange to mourn a death , and celebrate a birthday in the same week . just throwing that out there .... 
I thought you said forever\ 
Over and over\ 
A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion\ 
August evenings\ 
Bring solemn warnings\ 
To remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight 
who has pictures from the birthday party in Milwaukee ? i want them =) 
< PROPFEMALE > . let me get this straight Descartes . we don't exist ? 
go to the movie store as a reward after cleaning my room all day only to get hit by some crazy lady , go home to make cookie brownies and burn them . then i get the tiniest piece of glass in my foot and turn in to the worlds biggest baby . im going to bed now to watch movies with < PROPMALE > Gerardi =) 
=( SLEEP . i want it . 
If your Dad is , or was , a hard working man , and is your hero , has helped you no matter how good or bad you were ; if you are blessed to still have your Dad , or if he is in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one Dad ? Love you Dad 
What could I do\ 
My baby's love had gone\ 
And left my baby blue\ 
Nobody knew 
i wanna go to hash bash SOOOO bad . but i have to do homework instead so that i can go to dinner at 5 =( being a student sucks sometimes . 
fuck my life . =( 
im terribly ill =(
