man , I hate how science teachers grade labs like tests ... It's just not reasonable to expect someone to rush through an experiment , get all the right answers , AND show every single step by the end of a class period . 
Dungeons and dragons online won't download ... I suppose it's for the best . 
A porn lady just friend requested me ... clicked on a link ... sooooo ... many ... booooobies ... Not going there again :P

I remember the Simpson's episode when < PROPMALE > spent prayed to god to help in study and they had a snow day in the middle of spring .

Tommorow's gonna be like that . 
Why are chain e-mails all formatted using a giganting font that you can only read 3 words at a time of and in crazy colors ? Can't they just use normal type ? I know I would participate if it didn't take me 10 minutes to read them XD

Thanks to everybody for wishing me a happy birthday ! 
* snore * 
Grrr , pokemone firered is too easy . It makes me not want to get the new games . 
my problem with highschool science course is that even when we have the facility to do \labs\ " the material is still taught in the same way as if we did not have the lab . Everything is centered on memorizing facts as opposed to true independant discovery that learning science is all about . Anyone will agree that most of the things we learn in science have little application to succeeding in real life . " 
I don't consider myself shy ... but sometimes I try to talk and sound doesn't come out .

I was curious as to how < PROPFIRST > bieber sounded like , since everybody's hating on him so much . So I listen to one his songs . The song had just started and there was this girl singing , so I assumed that she was just singing the chorus and he would come in later . Then , the song ended .

How about instead of foreclosure , which is stupid and leaves a homeless person and a house unpaired , the debt is transferred to the government and they send you prison food while your salary goes to the government ? This would at least work for people with jobs , no ? 
Somebody signed me up for the Dairy < PROPFEMALE > fan club under < PROPMALE > Dipstick . Then again , that might have been me . I forget . 
I've been doing it wrong all these years ; Stretching is not an exercise in < i > defeating < /i > stress , but < i > releasing < /i > it . That's why it's so important to stretch for long periods of time .

Guys , < PROPFIRST > isn't really THAT crowded , it will just take awhile for the new freshmen to find the pathways other than < PROPFIRST > bullevard ( also returning students to remember >...>) , and find other haunts for lunchtime .

There are some people who believe roasting a marshmallow means putting a couple of light-brown spots on it , or just making it slightly warm . Those people are wrong . If the marshmallow doesn't briefly become a flaming beacon of justice , you're doin ' it wrong .
