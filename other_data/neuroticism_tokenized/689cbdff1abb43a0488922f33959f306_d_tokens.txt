You dont have to feel like a waste of space . Your original , cannot be replaced . If you only knew what the future holds . After a hurricane comes a rainbow . Maybe your the reason why all the doors are closed . So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Life is like a huge jigsaw that cant be solved sometimes . thats why i like to guess :) 
Completly closed one chapyer of my life today and it feels good :) . I hope this new year brings more and better chapters
