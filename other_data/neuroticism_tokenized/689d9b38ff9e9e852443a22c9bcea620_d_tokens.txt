its ironic when the mind is being optimistic and the heart is pessimistic .... usually the heart hopes against hope while the mind shoots it down ... amusing . 
hmm that was the longest strangest , by far the most epic zombie dream i have ever had .... O.o 
>.< yes i will answer any question you have for me honestly , but dont ask questions you dont want the answer to ...

absolutely hates the new facebook lay out , what were those idiots thinking ? 
Thank all you guys for the birthday wishes ! 
I had a great start to the day ... figures it could only go down hill from there . 
awesome day hanging with friends at corys ' barbecue , unfortunetely my night was its complete opposite and absolutely aweful 
i had forgotten how good it feels to just cruise I-25 for a couple hours while blasting your favorite songs 
just got home from a frantic night at work , now its time to relax the best way i know how ... by melting my face off with the most brutal metal i can find ... 
theres an evil feeling in our brains , but its nothing new , you know it drives us insane ! 
happy zombie jesus day guys ! 
im seriously considering joining the < PROPFEMALE > corp . 
is leaning more and more towards the United states < PROPFEMALE > corp .... with a year of college under my belt i go in as either an E2 or 3 and since i would go in with a < PROPMALE > thats another stripe plus 5k extra bonus , so id start as atleast a < PROPMALE > corporal . also i would most likely make the GI < PROPMALE > and they would pay for my college after i got out if i didnt become an officer .... sooooo yeeaahhh .... OOORRAAHHH 
to save my soul from disaster , self destruction could be the answer . 
whats with complete strangers adding me on facebook , if i dont know you then i dont want to know you . 
peace is for the dead , pain is a priveledge only for the living . 
i keep seeing movement out of the corner of my eye ... and considering everyone else in the house is asleep i am either insane or in the middle of a horror movie and about to be murdered ... lets find out . 
working out on a day where you have a paper to write at night is not the best idea ... 
12-15 < PROPFEMALE > paper due tomorrow followed by my final in chemistry .... awesome 
well my 15 < PROPFEMALE > paper is done , now time to study for my chemistry final thats tomorrow as well . 
alright , time to study my brains out for my soc final !

Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward . Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both . For a wounded man shall say to hiss assailent , if I live I shall kill you , and if I die you are forgivin , such are the rules of honor 
so going to talk to my recruiter tomorrow in a final effort to join the < PROPFEMALE > corp by becoming an officer , if this fails im screwed , as well as going into talk to a navy recruiter with my < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > about seal opportunities and then going to work out for the first time this week ... screw 12 hour work days .

Ok so < PROPFIRST > pilgrim vs the world was freaken amazing ! 
and the storm will sweep us up and we will ride the heart pumping breath stopping thrills of the twister and i will be beaten into the ground and left behind in this now barren wasteland . 
just made some giant bomb tasting elk burgers with my boy < PROPFIRST > .

so uproar was really good last night , it sucked till a7x took the stage and then they stole the show , i felt bad for disturbed having to follow them , though disturbed was good as well , Avenged was just amazing 
huh ... im kinda burnt out on everything ... 
i swear to god if i had a psychiatrist analyze my dreams , they would most likely put me in an insane asylum 
so today was filled with multiple minor annoyances , lack of time for food , having to redo a day and a halfs worth of windows at my work , car battery dying .... and its all made up for by another job falling into my lap =D 
huh i didnt know being an ass was a requirement for the colorado springs police department .... guess it explains all the crap they pull out of no where . 
uggh thank god tomorrow is friday 
Stand down , place your weapons by your side It's our war , in the end we'll surely lose but that's alright

the cold is back and the heat is gone , my vision goes black and the deed is done , its been far too long since ive felt this way , im welcoming it back for as long as it will stay , through my veins runs ice , and i shall throw the dice , and dance with < PROPFIRST > of the shadows .... welcome back < PROPFIRST > >=] for those who loved me this way enjoy it , for those who didnt , well ill enjoy it all the more .
