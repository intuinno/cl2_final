Happy New Years ! 
Just a small town girl Living in a lonely world She took the midnight train going anywhere Just a city boy Born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train going anywhere A singer in a smoky room A smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile they can share the night It goes on and on and on and on Strangers , waiting , up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlight people 
Once I < PROPFEMALE > above the noise and confusion Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion I was soaring ever higher , but I flew too high Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man Though my mind could think I still was a mad man I hear the voices when I'm dreamin ' , I can hear them say : < PROPFEMALE > on my wayward son , There'll be peace when you are done Lay your weary head to rest Don't you cry no more 
An ' here I go again on my own Goin ' down the only road I've ever known , Like a drifter I was born to walk alone An ' I've made up my mind I ain't wasting no more time I'm just another heart in need of rescue , Waiting on love's sweet < PROPFEMALE > An ' I'm gonna hold on For the rest of my days , ' Cos I know what it means To walk along the lonely street of dreams 
we've got to hold on to what we've got It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not We got each other and that's a lot For love we'll give it a shot ! Oh , we're half way there Oh oh , livin ' on a prayer Take my hand , we'll make it I swear Oh oh , livin ' on a prayer
