\The only people you need in your life are the ones that need YOU in theirs\ " prove to me I'm worth keeping in your life ;) " 
its funny to see the fat ppl on wall-e slide down , poor ppl , can't evn lift themselves up xD 
\Never frown because you'll never know who's falling in love with your smile\ " :) " 
a great message was delivered in church today , cant help but love the lord with everything i got , He's the reason i'm still standin strong , he's the reason why i'm still here , gosh words cant describe how amazing he is ! =D 
God doesn't put u through trials that u can't handle , just have faith . Have faith in yourself , and most importantly have faith in God , cuz when u do , everything will fall into place :) 
i hate economics with a passion -_- 
A smile of encouragement at the right moment may act like sunlight on a closed-up flower ; it may be the turning point for a struggling life 
\People who promise things that they never give are like clouds and wind that bring no rain . \ " Prov . 25:14 " 
sick :( 
Movin on to bigger n better things in life , taking chances , and just living in happiness .. now thas what I'm talkin about =] 
ASVAB tomorroooooooow >_< 
Keep smiling cuz u never know who's day your brightening up with just that one smile =] 
It's true that we don't know wat we've got til we lose it , but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives :) 
Wish I had a jamba juice to make it all better .. =/ 
In every crappy situation , theres always a reason to be happy , keep ur head up =] 
Ready for tha day =] gym later w/ < PROPFEMALE > Milledge & < PROPMALE > Grice ! woot woot ! =] 
“It’s sad when the people you know Became people you knew . When you can walk right past someone . Like they were never a big part of your life . How you used to be able to talk for hours And now you can barely even look at them . ” 
Coun't your blessings , not your problems ! ;) 
Doesn't feel like ima b 18 tomorrow -_- 
I don't get it .. Why do guys make a big deal out of nt lookn gay with their friends , bt when it comes to fball , bball , or any kinda sport , they slap each others butts n jump on top of each other ... ??? -_- 
Sometimes in order to make something happen , you gotta do things you've never done and take a path you've never gone down before =]
