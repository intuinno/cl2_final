\To live a life without taking chances isn't to live a life at all\ " \ 
True comedians are good at making fun of themselves 
Just taught myself to play Swing Life Away by Rise Against on the piano in 2 days with no tabs or sheet music just an iPod and a goal ! Lol 
If you died today can you honestly say you lived your life the way you wanted to , done the things you wanted to , fixed the things you needed to fix ? 
Would you rather live a life with many good friends or one true love ? 
Miss my best friend ... We should < PROPFEMALE > sometime soon :-) 
Live life , embrace love , forgive those that hurt you 
Probably asthmatic long distance runner , and most likely a lactose intolerant dairy lover ...... now I just need to start eating meat as a vegetarian and I'm the perfect paradox ! 
Live like you'll die tomorrow , love like it will be gone in a minute , and don't be afraid to take chances so that you'll never have regrets 
Your not a loser until you quit trying , and you will never win until you can accept defeat 
Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect , it just means you've decided to look past all of life imperfections 
Does anyone think the movie iRobot was just to make fun of apple ? 
alright I just jumped 7'6\ in pole vaulting . 6 ' more to be #1 on the team haha god I suck " 
\God gave me you for the ups and downs . God gave me you for when I'm in doubt . But for when the days I think nothings true I always know that god gave meyou . \ " good song " 
You can never fail until you stop trying 
True love is never gone , it may fade but it's always still there , and anyone who says it can has never been truly inlove .
