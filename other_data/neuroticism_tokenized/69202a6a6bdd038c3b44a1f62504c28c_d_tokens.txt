You might belong in Gryffindor , \ 
Where dwell the brave at heart , \ 
Their daring , nerve , and chivalry \ 
Set Gryffindors apart ; \ 
\ 
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw , \ 
if you've a ready mind , \ 
Where those of wit and learning , \ 
Will always find their kind ; \ 
Or perhaps in Slytherin \ 
You'll make your real friends , \ 
Those cunning folks use any means \ 
To achieve their ends . 
I will be adding some photos later today from my last photoshoot . Stay tuned viewers . :) 
I feel much better today . I was able to say some things Ive been holding back for a while . Phew ... It is never good to keep feelings to yourself . They just build up until you feel like you might burst ! And then that would be a terrible mess someone would have to clean up . I crave porkchops . 
Okay , hoping today is a great day ~ Going jogging as soon as I finish getting dressed after my nice hot shower ^_^ ~ And then heading to the college for my final book for the semester ~ After that , maybe I will have a friend over to play video games with meeee ~ \ 
Any takers ?

Riding my motorcycle to get myself some chicken ! ~ Lol ~ 
I feel ... cold . ( Name that obscure quote . Ill give you a hint . In the scene in which this was said there was a lot of gold coins and a pistol . ) 
Boom chicky boom . It's so very nice ... So full of spice . All the senoritas are so very sweeta . 
Sooo .... anyone up for dancing tonight ? 
Snooooowwwww !!!! Mwahahahaaa ! 
There's nothing better than streaking through the snow . I'm so white no one could even see me . 
Gremlin slid down a huge hill and got stuck . Guess who had to climb Down to save . 
Its a wonderful life . I am so grateful for all that I have . Sometimes we tend to lose sight of how lucky we really are . Take time today to think of everything in your life that you love and thank the heavens that it's in your life . ;) 
I got to tell off a stupid cop today . And he couldnt do < PROPFIRST > about it . Mwahahaha ! My knowledge of local laws prevails again ! ~ 
Life is a series of disappointments . The only way to survive it is to stop expecting something better , because this is the best youll ever have ... 
I'm so tired of this ache in my heart . We are all alone . All the time . :'( what's the reason that keeps anyone going on ? I've lost sight of my reason . I wish it would come back . 
Wow , Ive been having serious mood swings the last couple of days ... its exhausting and frustrating .... 
For my birthday on Monday ( MLK day also ) I am doing volunteer work at my college . Its going to be a great way to start my 22nd year and hopefully I can get some good < PROPFEMALE > points too . Lol ! ;) 
Amazing party with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and of course the ever theorizing Lennon . Really fun ! Thanks guys for coming and making it awesome ! 
Thanks everyone who wished me a happy birthday . I have my second week of college today . Did volunteer work all day yesterday . And tomorrow ... yoga . 
Today is yoga day . And then I have to spend time with my grandmother for it is her birthday . If anyone asks , she and I have agreed she is only 48 . 
Today is my homework/cleaning day . And once I am done with those things , I can finally do something fun like play DDR on my xbox ! Or go for a walk with Gremlin ! Maybe both . So I better get to it ! 
Today's agenda : Rake some pine straw , study , modeling gig , andperhaps a massage if I have the time . :) 
I have green fingernails the color of < PROPFEMALE > . ;) neat ! 
is really f***ing sick right now . Oh god , I hope I dont have to miss school tomorrow . This is more than a cold ... 
Havin ' some good times in college . Not too bad . In the words of the great < PROPFIRST > Lopez ... I GOT THIS ! And so I do . ;) 
We are gonna get either a honda or a smart car . Woot woot ! Thats what I hope . Smart car gets awesome gas mileage and the honda lasts forever ... 
Publishing my novel Soon , let me know if you want to reserve a copy 
Gonna take my bike out for a spin today ! that'll help clear my mind so I can focus on my homework better . Then maybe a little yoga to help the ol ' back . ^_ ~ 
There was a black dog in the road and I swerved to avoid it . The dog and motorcycle are okay . And I only have to walk with a cane for a few weeks until the little fracture on my leg heals up . Not so bad . 
A long day , but I feel really great . Got my hair done , new clothes and earrings , and some good makeup . I think everything is going to be okay . :) 
I have such a busy weekend ahead of me ! I am so excited ! :D 
Oooh you sexy thang ! Sexy thang ! 
Last night was strange .... but it made me feel something familiar that I didn't know I could still feel ... I am a little confused by it . 
It is nice out . I think I will try to jog . My leg hasn't been too bad the last two days . I will give it a try ! I need to be in shape for the Army . \ 
:) 
When you want something badly enough , you never give up . 
Valentines day came so fast ! I hope that everyone has someone special to them to share this evening with . Whether it be a romantic night ... or a little naughty . ^_ ~ 
Love lifts us up where we belong . Where eagles fly on a mountain high . Love makes us act like we are fools . 
OKAY ! School ends at the beginning of May ! Three months ! I can do this ! ^_ ~ 
A good Day to try new things ! ^_ ~ 
My spring break is march 5-13 !!! Wooo ! 
Friday ! After I finish up my online class today ... I can relax my brain for a couple of days ... phew ! 
Gotta keep my good grades up ! 
Just trying to move on with life . Sometimes you have to give up what you want because it just won't happen .... 
Today is a beautiful day . I wonder what the day will bring :) 
Ahk ! Why did it get chilly again !? Stop playing with my mind mother nature ! 
Sometimes ... When you least expect it .... The most annoying song of our times lodges itself in an endless loop inside of your brain .... 
I got a cavity drilled without any drugs today ! They just drilled and filled ! It was badass ! It started to hurt pretty bad right at the end , but I did it !! 
Only two weeks until I have my new macaw , < PROPFEMALE > . She is amaaazing ! 
I visited < PROPFEMALE > the macaw today . She was happy to see me and protested when I had to leave . :) 
I got another A+ in < PROPMALE > class and an A+ on my Spanish quiz too ! Good grades mean a good career later !!! 
Another lovely day . I will try to do more in the yard before studying for my Spanish test :) 
I'm feeling pretty amazing today even with my fever 
Everything is wonderful wonderful wonderful again !!!! <3 
Things are at last amazing again and then a guy I never met , but only spoke to online a few times has been harassing me . I got his account blocked on facebook for harrassment ! ( Take that !! ) \ 
He is just upset that I wouldnt go on a date with him . \ 
Sending rude messages and spreading lies about a girl DOES NOT get her to like you . 
I am not in the dating game for anyone who wants to know . < PROPFEMALE > is taken !!! So friends are great . I am happy with what I have got :D 
I have been pretty productive this spring break . :) And I still have until Tuesday to do more !!! 
Name five things that people pass around . GO !! 
Ate rice for breakfast just like I were living in the Orient . Well , anyone want to wear kimonos and play under the < PROPFEMALE > blossoms trees with me ? 
Mwahahahaha ! A good maniacal laugh always rejuvinates me ! 
A lovely day ! I hope to get a lot done ! 
Back to school :) \ 
The backyard is looking so nice already ! < PROPMALE > is doing a great job on the stone wall . I am excited to see how everything looks at the end of the summer !!! 
I have everything I need to get where I want to go . And then ... When I get there ... I can do all the things I want without limits . 
The wearing of the green !!! Shamrock and roll everybodiez !!!! 
I sent my novel into the Suduvu Writing Contest . WISH ME LUCK ! Winners announced May 18 , 2011 . 
Should I sell my novel as an ebook on amazon/kindle to get started ? 
•••A beautiful day to get a lot done ! Clean , homework ... and my favorite part --> Plant flowers in the yard !!!! La la la ! ••• 
I battled an army of ants to the death . Gremlin fought valiantly beside of me . 
Riding to yoga !!! Does it seem odd to drive a motorcycle to a yoga class ? 
Riding in the rain to Matthews nc , then all the way to york sc :( 
Spanish and < PROPMALE > classes today . Tomorrow , I have a < PROPMALE > to sleep some !! It will be a pretty weekend finally ! \
