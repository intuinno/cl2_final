is ecstatic that she now has all day tomorrow off ... and will most likely be out of work early enough for fireworks and happy times on Saturday ! :) ! 
has successfully drowned her worries in cran and absolut , whilst prancing about her apt like a crazy person with the best friend a fruit fly could ever ask for . 
We're just two souls , swimming in a fish bowl ... 
= Sex and the City DVDs , ice cream , and night out with the girls and < PROPMALE > tonight ... just what I need .

and the girls are recovering from an epic party last night . like whoa . i shattered my two drink limit AND drank whiskey ? Oy . 
= UES exploring and thrifting , Sex and the City , margaritas , epic party debauchery , < PROPFIRST > , cupcakes , new hair , Astoria Park jogs , yummy Greek food ... what turned out to be a fantastic long weekend , all with the best friends a girl could ask for . <3 <3 <3 . 
\The opposite of < PROPMALE > is not ugliness ... the opposite of love is not hate ... its indifference . \"" 
is feeling an intense need to create something , anything ... then I can have some purpose and stop feeling like a zombie , aimlessly wandering day after day ... 
thinks old habits die hard ... and history tends to repeat itself . 
= glorious day off in the city . Join me ? 
= rainy day . Laundry + gym + wine + bestie = <3 . 
= Friday Madness begins now . Be there or be square :) Text if you are joining us ! 
= sun , shore , boardwalk , fondue , happy times ... out of the city for the day for < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday ! 
is falling back down the rabbit hole . 
= yoga , pilates , and gym , all in one morning . wheeew . 
realizes that 2 months have flown by ... and how things have changed . But better or worse , right or wrong , laughter or tears ... at least I'm learning , day by day . ? 
should probably stop fighting fate/karma , and just listen to what the universe has made obvious . 
had a really wonderful evening , catching up with some lovely people . :) . 
is lighting some incense and snuggling up in bed with some tea and a good book for a late night read . Joy . <3 . 
has zombied her way through an entire day , and is extremely happy to finally curl up in bed and pass the f *** out . 
= have no expectations , avoid disappointment ... and just leave the < PROPMALE > of being pleasantly surprised . 
= District 9 , epic dinner , MarioKart , hangout and catch up time until wee hours . <3 . 
= holy mindfuck . What a weekend . Wall-E in Astoria Park tonight , 8pm , join ! 
is snapping back to reality , however warped it may be . 
= cinnamon sugar pita chips , mmmmm . 
\And suppose I never met you . Suppose we never fell in love . Suppose I never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft . Suppose I never ever saw you . Suppose we never ever called . Suppose I kept on singing love songs just to break my own fall ... \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Spektor . <3 her . "

My idea of the perfect day off tomorrow = Dimsum . Afternoon of wandering the museum/park or staying in for a movie/games . Dinner/drinks/night of good friends , conversation , and loveliness . Got the plan , only thing missing is ... you :) ! lmk if you'd like to join me , loves !

work , show , MGM's last night in the city ! Come < PROPFEMALE > ! Oh , and GO GATORS ! :) 
is close to achieving the perfect balance between no sleep and coffee intake , in order to pass for a still functioning and vaguely alert human being . 
You'd think , being an only child , I'd be used to entertaining myself and having alone time . Rather , empty apartment + unexpected night off + no plans = driving me crazy . 
= made it through tech weekend . Opening tomorrow ! 
= Good morning , starshine . 
= Wanna put my tender heart in a blender , watch it spin ' round to a beautiful oblivion ... rendevous then I'm through with you . 
= exhausted and slightly miserable . Can't wait for Sunday ... first full day off in nearly 2 weeks !

is off to The Colbert Report with < PROPMALE > ! wee . 
took over Manhattan , cooked amazing food , vegged out , and was the muse for a rather offensive song . Just a typical lovely Sunday with < PROPFIRST > E Salazar ! 
realized today is her 4 month anniversary ... and yep , I'm still in love , New York City . :) . 
is knitting a scarf at 2:30 am . Oh , late night insomniac fun .

Opinion , my fellow theatre people ; What is your view on joining AFTRA now , in order to have the option of buying into Equity/SAG after a year ? Pros , cons ? Taking into consideration that the AFTRA fee goes up another $300 after this week ? <3 .
