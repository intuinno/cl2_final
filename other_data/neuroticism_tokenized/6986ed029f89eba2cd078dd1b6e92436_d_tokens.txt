I can't find my DSi . I think I might've slipped it into someone else's bag by accident at after-prom which would most likely make it in either < PROPMALE>'s or Cat's . If you have it , please contact me ASAP . = < 
Have a happy holiday that has lost it's meaning for the sake of sell-ability ... I mean every significant day of the year ... I mean Easter .

Got a new mattress yesterday . Didn't want to wake up to go to church for a new reason today . 
HORY SHET ! Drove past a parked state trooper doing 80 on the highway ( speed limit of 55mph ) on my way to college . My heart skipped a beat as I quickly slowed down , however he didn't tail me or anything . 
Defragmenting my laptop . 2 hours in it's 50% done . I have to be ready to leave in less than an hour from now . = I 
It's always lupus . Always . 
Trying to draw , internet is distracting . What else is new ... 
I don't want to drive to college . I just did on Tuesday . 
According to everybody in my family , nobody I know online is real and therefore I couldn't possibly have relationships with any of you because we're not talking face-to-face . Sorry , to inform you guys don't exist and that we could never be friends even if you did but my mom is the master of the universe so how could she possibly be wrong ? 
Fucking magnets , how do they work ? 
Just pulled up 4-5 feet of roots of a plant out of my mom's garden . Tired and sore now ... 
My brain is full of fuck .

I'm drawing a comic for my final in my < PROPMALE > class . I need to finish the < PROPFEMALE > I'm currently working on , and then draw and color 5 more in the next 18 hours . Each one takes a good 3-5 hours . I also need to find time to eat and sleep ... College sucks . 
Dear facebook , \ 
STOP ASKING ME TO MAKE YOU MY HOMEPAGE . GOOGLE IS JUST FINE . GODDAMN , I'D MAKE /b/ MY HOMEPAGE BEFORE YOU . \

In other news North Korea fired artillery at South Korea about an hour ago , setting fire to a bunch of homes . /b/ thinks it's the start of WWIII .

In the Mouth of Madness is such a lovely movie to watch by yourself , in the dark , at night . 
This is why nobody launches yogurt ... 
I'll probably still have time to lay in my bed , stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness .... 
New comic posted . http://snowfall.thecomicseries.com/ 
I need some onamonapia for struggled breathing . Anybody got any suggestions ? 
So my webcomic has gotten one view from : Mexico , Estonia , and The United Kingdom ; Two views from : Norway and Brazil ; Three views from Canada ; and 55 views from The USA . Nebraska has the most , making up 40% of the total views . Texas is second at 7.76% . Google Analytics is an awesome ... count-y thingie . XD 
Guys , only 15 more sleeps till Christmas . 
Anybody else here enjoy Lustmord ? 
AHHH ! I'M FEELING UNWARRENTED SELF-IMPORTANCE ! IT'S ALL TINGLY AND IS MAKING ME HAPPY ! MAKE IT STOP !

It's almost been 3 years since I came up with the idea for these little guys . Haven't drawn them that much , but they've already evolved a ton . ) 
I had a weird dream last night . < PROPFEMALE > , myself , and a some girl I know but can't remember ( but I do know she hates my guts ) were in a car and I was telling them how my last name could have been ' Chimichanga . ' Also we were driving around in Bellevue West going to somebody's house , but I can't remember whose or why . 
The average human life span is 657,000 hours . Around 33% of the time will be spent sleeping , around 30% will be spent on education and work , and around 27% will be spent taking care of our mortal bodies ( spent in the bathroom , food preparation and eating , exercise , etc . ) . The other 10% is the time I can be spending with you , but it's nowhere near enough . 
Got a haircut ... I miss my long hair ... 
I'm scared of being in public alone . Because people scare me . A person is smart . People are dumb , panicky , dangerous animals . I need someone to shepherd me around . Otherwise I'll start pacing in circles , starting up conversations with myself about how I hate being in public and why it was a bad idea to go out . This helps because nobody wants to bother the crazy person talking to imaginary whatevers . 
Thank you /wg/ for teaching me how to pimp out my computer . 
Oh yeah , almost forgot . I had another weird dream last night . Apparently I was going to get married to a midget by a giant who only agreed to marry us because the midget had gone out of it's way to kick the giant's ass . The giant refused to marry us in mid ceremony because I was playing a skateboarding video game instead of playing < PROPMALE > says with them ( the giant and the midget ) . 
I didn't ask to be here , stop acting like I had a say in my existence . Especially if you're the one responsible for my being in this crapsack world . 
I have this amazing ability on forums that have around 3-20 people on all the time on average ( they people post often , but not all the time ) . Whenever I post anything , anywhere the forum will stop all activity for about 20 minutes . Then it will resume like I never posted anything . It doesn't matter how well known or popular I am , it just always happens . 
The only part of a dentist visit I don't like is the fluoride . I don't see why people absolutely hate going . And apparently I have to have three wisdom teeth pulled . I hope they put me under again , like when I had to get 7 teeth pulled for braces . All I remember was them sticking my arm with the needle then them dragging me out the backdoor to my mom's < PROPFIRST > . 
I need to stop forgetting that an hour or so before I'm going to bed is not a good time to catch up on the Slender Man Mythos , or whatever creepy/horror fiction/copy pasta I happen to find per week . Because I'll start hallucinating that shit if i sit in the dark long enough . 
Man am I tired . I had to WALK today . Goddamn , what is this world coming to ? :P 
Why do I only finish my best pics at 2 am , thus ensuring nobody will see it ? DX 
I hope my mother realizes that ' Toddlers in Tiaras ' is a show for pedophiles . The entire show is on the basis of sexualizing 12 months to 12 year olds . 
Apparently my mother fucking doesn't like what I'm posting on fucking Facebook as far as fucking statuses go so I'm assuming someone fucking tipped her off because I know she doesn't get on fucking Facebook . So whoever is fucking offended by what I put on the fucking internet , just remember , I can say whatever the fuck I fucking want . Fuck . 
2 gigs of RAM is not enough for drawing stuff . At least for the picture I'm working on now , which is huge for the sake of detail . I can't do anything anymore without getting a buffer overflow , thus rendering my previous action void . I poke the screen to add 1 pixel of color and ' BUFFER OVERFLOW ERROR - previous action undone . ' 
Why is the high octane nightmare fuel < PROPFEMALE > so enticing at half past midnight , when it is dark and lonely ? D: 
Fuck football , where's the funny commercials ? 
With the exception of Slash's solo with that girl who can't sing , the half time show sucked . Too much auto-tune , not enough actual talent . 
Just installed Windows 7 . Hope I didn't completely destroy the laptop I've built up for the last 8 or so months . 
Laptop charger finally died . Won't be online for a while until I can get it replaced . =\\ 
Bought a new charger . Should be here on Friday . 
Charger came today and it works perfectly ! I missed-ed joo laptop , I missed-ed joooooo ! ;o ; 
Finally rid of my malware ! And it only took 4 anti-malware services and one anti-virus service .

When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean , \ 
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down , \

All because of you , \ 
I believe in angels . \ 
Not the kind with wings , \ 
No , not the kind with halos , \

I'll follow your voice , \ 
All you have to do is shout it out . 
The cable is acting up ... Either the internet will go down or the TV will go static . Or both . Anybody else who is up at 4am for whatever reason and is in the bellevue/omaha area having this problem ? 
Bah , internet isn't loading properly . Damn you crappy wireless ! 
IT'S 3:00 AM ! 
IT'S 4:00 AM ! LIKE A BOSS !

Why is it that every time I'm angry I begin to shake uncontrollably like I'm in withdrawal or something ? I tremble so much , I feel like I have to put on a coat . 
Must ... work ... on ... comic ... internet ... too ... distracting ....

The Firefox 4 Beta is pretty neat . Only one of my add-ons wasn't compatible , and I hadn't realized how used to it I had gotten until after it stopped working .
