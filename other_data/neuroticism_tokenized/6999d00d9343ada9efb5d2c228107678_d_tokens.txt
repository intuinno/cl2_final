It always seems like iTunes knows what mood I'm in when it's on shuffle . 
This is how it works : You're young until you're not , you love until you don't , you try until you can't , you laugh until you cry , you cry until you laugh , and everyone must breathe until their dying breath . I <3 ReginaSpektor

Academy of Sciences and Pookie tomorrowwww <3 
It's Pookie's birthday ... at 12:19 am . 
197 down , 221 to go ._. 
A chair is still a chair , even when there's no one sitting there . 
The bike ride took my mind off of things a little . My butt hurts , though . 
I probably won't do my homework until it's really late , and I'm really tired . Srsly . Watch . 
Internet , this is no time to be a douche . I just started on my homework ; told you . 
It's a quarter after one ( but not really ) , I'm all alone and I need you now ..... p.s. IwishIcouldreadsuperfast . 
< PROPFEMALE > Allen <3 
Okay I'm really ..... really flippin ' tired . 
Today was nice <3 
-is < PROPFEMALE > - I want to ride my biCYCLE , I want to ride my biiiike . I want to ride my biCYCLE , I want to ride it where I liiiiike . :D 
< PROPFEMALE > was here , stalking Karli's Facebook thingy-ma-jig . Fear me . >:3 
Had a blast today . I want more days like this . 
Another nice day :D 
Don't stop when you've never been closer just because you don't know what matters most . The way won't always be so clearly right in front of us . And if the sun will set tonight , we'll hold our secrets up to the sky . As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide . 
You said you'd be my dream , I could have you every night ; and if by morning I'd forgotten you , well , no big deal . I'd be alright because you're the recurring kind ; you never really leave my mind . 
Back in my day , warped tour was a lot cheaper D: 
is not going to CSUMB next year ..... :( ...... \ 
Hopefully Cabrillo lets me in . 
Life inside a music box ain't easy ; the mallets hit , the gears are always turning . And everyone inside the mechanism is yearning to get out and sing another < PROPFEMALE > completely , so different from the one they're always singing . 
Why is it 9 already ?! It feels like I just got home o.o .... hmmm .... Prom tomorrow ! <3 
Prom was superfun . So was the afters . And this mornings . But my tummy hurts really really bad D: 
Falling asleep at 6:30 pm and sleeping until the next morning is weird . I didn't feel like going to school today . I've been wearing a lot of dresses lately . I wanna go on a bike ride , but it looks kinda cold outside . Maybe I'll go anyway . 
What if the sword kills the pen ? 
off to drivers training . 
Yay freshman day :D I'm having flashbacks already . The only thing I'm wearing that isn't from my freshman year is my pants . Woo ? 
Dood . I can't believe the rally is already tomorrow . 
STOP ! Rally time ! -dances to hammer time- 
had a really good day ( except for a few minor details ) BUT ! Over-all , super awesome day full of people I lurrve <3 
Milk , you are not my friend . I ain't < PROPFEMALE > gonna drink you < PROPFEMALE > no mo ! 
wants the ocean right now . 
Just got home from her last choir concert ... EVER . -victory dance- It was fun :) 
I always find it amazing when I hear songs that fit my current situation perfectly . 
I still feel all weird and jittery , but I had a good day :) 
Peeeeeewwwwkkkiiieeeee is coming over todaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy :D :D :D 
I have the meanest morning hair ever . It doesn't want to do anything ! 
had a nice time with people today <3 Almost done with my Sociology cheat sheet , and then on to Government-studying . Woohoo ? 
High school ? Over ? ... woah . 
Is it possible for pants to make you feel lazy ? I think my pants are making me feel lazy . 
is jealous that Callala got to see Raychool at Tip n ' Toe D: ! 
is a laptoppin ' gangsta ! :D 
I'm having one of those days where it feels amazing to be alive and have such wonderful people in my life . <3 
is now a graduate of San < PROPMALE > High . Yayyy :D 
had a great day with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and Chey :) 
Pookie time -hammerdance- 
finally has a bathingsuit . :D 
If you -like- this status I'll post something I\ 
like about you on your wall ?! :3 
And < PROPFEMALE > was like -flagstabstabstab- and the cricket was like -dead- ! 
I can't find my tripod . This is rather upsetting . 
You had your < PROPMALE > ; open arms reject assuming hands . Life is finally about to change . 
I got a disposable kodak underwater camera . Even though it's probably crappy i'm super excited you use it !! :D :D :D 
I finally built up the guts to clean the inside of my camera ... and it worked :D No more random dots in my piccchhhaassss . Yae . 
I think I've vented enough to enjoy the rest of\ 
my evening . :) OH , and who wants to do an outfit , underwater , and/or jumping picture photoshoot with me ?! I'm looking for a buncha peopleee , and I've already told Siennana about it . Lemme know ! 
Now that it's June , we'll sleep out in the garden . And if it rains , we'll just sink into the mud where it is quiet and much cooler than the house is , and there's no clocks or phones to wake us up . 
True Life : \I have acne\ " made me wanna scrub my face real bad ._. " 
So , driver's training is compleeeeettteeeee . -victory dance- . It was a nice drive to < PROPFIRST > Hill , except for that huge bird that hit my windsheild . It was really really hard not to laugh , as bad as that sounds . 
is going to CSUMB again ! :D 
got to see a bunch of great people today <3 yayyyy :) 
That bike ride was in-tents . Pookie left me :( 
Morning bike rides are nice ... when you're running on more than 3 hours of sleep , have food in your stomach , and it's not completely up-hill . Good morning . I'm going to pride with my Oskarbaby today . <3 
Skinburn . Footzhurt . Bodyhurt . Sun not friend . Sun not friend at all . Despite sun not being a friend and really-crowded-frustration , today was fun ! Yay for spending all day with Oskar <3 , being complimented , feelin ' classy , seeing Aubree , having couture mini-water/weird sculpture thing photoshoots , 45-minute pick-me-up naps and having fun at In-n-out , trying to talk like < PROPMALE > Noriega , and to overall superfungaydays :D 
is never eating red < PROPFEMALE > anything ever again :( 
So please forgive what I have done . No , you can't stay mad at the setting sun because we all get tired , I mean , eventually . There is nothing left to do but sleep . 
had a great day with her Carrot Man :) 
Ohai , it's July . 
is not your ghost anymore . 
Me : \Pookie there's something wrong with my hand . \ " \ 
My room is spotless and beautiful :D 
Telling the truth is the much less annoying and time-consuming way to go about things ; so cut the bullshit , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ohai , it's the fourth of july ! Everyone have a nice time watching things explode tonight :D 
:) It turned out to be a nice fourth of July <3 Hope everyone had a good time . 
Pookie and I just got our fitness on ! Oh lawd , I tire . 
San < PROPFEMALE > time with Pookie ! :D 
-stomps through safeway at 11:30 at night with Pookie-\ 
\WHERE'S THE KILLING ME SLOWLY ISLE ?! \"" 
Ha , NEXT . I had a great day :) 
Kati : \How come every time I look at your face I want to take my phone and < PROPMALE > it at you ? \ " \ 
Don't hold me up now ; I can stand my own ground . 
Nothing is as pressing as the one who's pressing would like you to believe . 
Say goodnight , super annoying fady hair that \ 
probably no one else noticed was fading but me ! Ahhh . I did nothing \ 
but exercised all day . Pookie would maybe probably actually like me \ 
right now . Body .... hurt ..... aye . Yay for keeping up with summer goals ? 
Maybe going away isn't such a bad idea . 
Apparently people on deviantart don't believe in clothing . Geeze ._. 
Shine your shoes , wipe your .... face . Duloc is , Duloc is , Duloc is a peeerfect plaaace ! 
It's actually beginning to feel like ... summer ? What ? 
can't take back those hours , but I won't regret because you can grow flowers from where dirt used to be . 
needs new music again . Any suggestions ? 
Interesting night . I liked . Thanks for all the music suggestions guys . :D 
3AM , dead time . Heeeere ghostie ghostie ghosties . -enjoys being creepy- Goodnight ! 
Well , that dilemma is over . I'm signed up for classes now wooooooo . -stops stressing- Damn , this keyboard is < PROPFIRST > as hey'll . 
I wish I knew about Tumblr before I began my 365 . 
Okay , coming home to spaghetti AND stuffed mushrooms says it all . Today was a good day . :D 
is not a fan of unexpected 5-hour naps . Waking up when it's dark is weird > < 
had a nice bad bitchin ' bike ride . Now for my guardies :) 
< PROPFEMALE > sounds like < PROPFIRST > Connery in the morning . 
needs inspiration . 
finds it hard to tell you , finds it hard to take . When people run in circles , it's a very , very mad world . 
just spent three hours deleting and going through old myspace messages . Now they can never make me sad again ! I saved the good stuff , though . And I found some old pictures that I had forgotten about . Okay , it's 4am . Goodnight . 
loves ghost shows . 
Bike ridin ' time with Siennanananana ! 
Random fun days are my favorite . -sleepy- 
can now scratch watching Titanic off the list . I didn't cry that much ' cause the freakin ' people pissed me off ! But , the old people always get me . Dammit . Gotta say , though ... hearing/watching Sienna < PROPFEMALE > Coile Robrock bawl while rambling about womanly things is the funniest shit ever :D Great night ! <3 
is a Flickr Pro again . Wooooo ! :D 
is packing for some caaaaaamping :D -excitement- 
< PROPFIRST > Darko , you make my brain hurt . 
Kat Deeley's dress on SYTYCD last night looked like a color guard tunic . 
had a nice camping trip :) 
I love when Baby goes into meatloaf mode . 
Mom : \My boss asked me what a thespian was today . \ " \ 
Bike crashes suck . 
It's kinda sad that I still get super excited when Good < PROPFEMALE > is on TV xD 
< PROPFEMALE > , you're such a dish ! 
Room dirty . Elbow hurt . Karli lazy . Crap . 
Looking toward the future , we were begging for the past . Well , we know we had the good things but those never seem to last . 
Sienna:\what's the black girl on the rugrats name again ? Shaniqua ? \ " Me :\ " Susie ?! \ " lolololol " 
BOO YOU STINK . 
LOL @SCHOOL -GOERS . 
Mom , Dad , < PROPFEMALE > at work + < PROPFEMALE > at school + Me home alone = Singing at the top of my lungs . :D Yae . 
Why do I love new school supplies so much ? -happy dance- 
I am sick of this gaping hole in my arm . Go away and stop hurting , please . 
I woke up this morning to a cat sitting on my face . 
' s lips are burnin ' . Damn you , Tapatio . 
Why is < PROPFEMALE > Winslet so damn cute ? 
This is how it works : You peer inside yourself , you take the things you like , then try to love the things you took . And then you take that love you made and stick it into someone else's heart , pumping someone else's blood . And walking arm-in-arm , you hope it doesn't get harmed ; but even if it does , you'll just do it all again . 
Kati : \What would you say if a guy told you that your eyes were like a bag from Loui ? \ " \ 
-complain- 
is doing math ...? And kinda sorta understanding it ?!?!?! WHAT . 
Yard workin ' men , you do not make me happy . I wanted to sleep longer D: 
Singing is my substitute for yelling . Therefore , being home alone is very nice . 
Sienna < PROPFEMALE > Coile Robrock is coming to school with me and < PROPMALE > Oates today ! This makes me happy :D 
gets to sleep tonight . YUSSSSS . :D 
loves Sienna < PROPFEMALE > Coile Robrock and wishes her the best of luck with moving to San < PROPFIRST > tomorrow <3 
is getting a new camera soon , possibly :) -excited- 
Kati : \You sound super quiet and creepy when you're trying to be polite . \"" 
Me : \KORI THERE'S A STOOPID FLY IN OUR ROOM THAT WON'T STOP BUZZING . \ " \ 
Me : \I'm a shitty friend 
I apologize to anyone who got a call from me early this morning . It wasn't me D: Apparently someone found my phone and tried calling people in it . But anyway , I have a phone and all of my < PROPFIRST > again so it's all gewd . 
Essays , go write yourselves . I have a headache . 
Ohnoz where did all the clouds go ?! 
-complain- IT IS FREAKING HOT IN THIS LIBRARY . 
OH MY GAWD IT'S SEPTEMBER . 
A word of advice : Don't listen to \Here's to the Night\ " by < PROPFEMALE > 6 while looking through old pictures . Super depressing . " 
I think I see a fire cloud out the window of the library o.o ... ohnoz . 
There will come a time , you'll see , with no more tears . And love will not break your heart , but dismiss your fears . Get over your hill and see what you find there with grace in your heart and flowers in your hair . 
I guess I never grew out of the \boys are icky\ " stage . " 
Hey YOU . If anyone needs to get ahold of me , please call . The screen on my phone no longer works , so I can't text . -_- But I can still answer da phonez . 
I hate you too , old desktop piece of bologna . Anyway . It was nice catching up with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > today <3 . Not looking forward to getting up at six , but hey , whateva . I think I'm gonna do the whole red lipstick thing tomorrow , but probably not until it matters ;) Goodnight . 
Alrighty , it looks like my phone is done for good . It won't even turn back on now . Wonderful , I know . So ... sorry , I won't be able to answer back to anyone . Hopefully I will have another backup phone until I ( might ) get one for my birthday . Dagnabbit . 
I find that it's useless to look cute if you haven't got the personality to back it up . So it's kinda stupid for me to get all prettied-up for that class when I'm too hungry and exhausted to even keep up a conversation . -Complain- I am full of babble today . 
had one of those dreams last night where you really wish it could have been real once you wake up . It kept me awake thinking about it for a good half-hour . Daammmaattt . But at least I actually remembered a dream for once ! 
You're already the voice inside my head . 
I\ 
have a replacement phone for now . Text me so I can haz numbas . I \ 
already knew Pookie's , < PROPFEMALE>'s , < PROPFEMALE>'s , and Darien's . But thass itttt 
... how do I describe a sabre ? 
Going to Japan Town for < PROPFEMALE > Thompson's birthday :) Happy burfday , mah sistuhh . I'm hoping to see Sienna < PROPFEMALE > Coile Robrock and/or < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > some time while we are there ! 
Mmmmm I love writing moods . 
has just about the shittiest phone luck ever . My replacement phone only works randomly . It won't send texts to most people . So , if I've called you in the past few days , it's because I couldn't text you . The end . 
I would like to chop all of my hair off again . 
misses friends . And hugs . Especially hugs . 
Sharkbate , oo-ha-ha . 
Eff this crap . I am getting at least four-ish hours of sleep tonight . Hmph . 
My sandwich needs to quit looking at me all \eat me \"- like . " 
lives in a yellow submarine . 
I just came up with an idea that I'm pretty excited about . For my next 365-like project , I wanna take each sentence from my Bio and take a picture to represent that sentence . It will be like one of those confession projects .... The end :D 
is straightener-less . Damn you , < PROPFEMALE > Tie . My hair is like curly as hey'll today ._. 
I had a dream that I met < PROPFEMALE > Spektor <3 
Alright , red , it's been a good three days , but I think it's time for you to leave . Bright hair just doesn't work for me anymore xD 
I hate it when my hair looks good at night . What's the point ?! and then I sleep on it and it goes all uxbdviousbgiousg and stoopid . COMPLAIN . 
How did we meet ? ( Copy this onto your status and see who remembers . ) \ 
... \ 
-curious- 
would like to take this weather and put it back in the summer where it belongs . 
I got my lomo fisheye film developed :D YEYUHH 
This is the anthem , throw all ya hands up . 
Incredibly strong gross fail coffee , fun volta-filled car ride , and the blood brothers . Now that's a nice morning :D 
As my college experience progresses , the stronger my bullshitting skills become . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ! I feel super loved :D <3 
Well , I'm finally legal . I'm definitely going to remember this birthday . Spending all day with Kor and < PROPMALE > , going to Panda , getting lots of facebook lovin ' , having my teacher crush and everyone in that class sing to me , taking random < PROPFEMALE > bikerides and having my first encounter with a cop ...? Yeah , it was pretty great :D 
saw CONOR FREAKING OBERST . Even though we only got to see him play about three songs ' cause we were late , it was soooo worth it <3 Now all I need is to see < PROPFEMALE > Spektor , then my life will be complete . -cheesy- ANYWAY . I also had a fantastic day with Sienna < PROPFEMALE > Coile Robrock , later joined by < PROPMALE > Oates . Thanks you guys <3 Now , it's passing out time :D 
Kori : -inspects- \ .... do these have eggs in them ? \ " \ 
The wind is making the windows make creepy noises . 
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops . And even then , we'll start again and just pretend that nothing ever happened . 
I didn't just accidentally drop my pen off of the second floor balcony ... 
I've been playing the Beatles all morning . This would be perfect if only weather.com hadn't lied to me and it was freakin ' raining . I feel like starting an angry mob against the weather man like in that one Fairly OddParents episode . Where's my pitchfork ? 
That box and those memories finally buried . I love getting rid of old stuff . 
SLEEP WANT NOW . Head hurt . Miss Oskar . Complain . 
is looking for faces in the clouds . 
Does anyone have a functioning verizon phone that they don't use anymore and are willing to give me ? :/ 
had a nice evening with < PROPFEMALE > Hindman and Sienna < PROPFEMALE > Coile Robrock . <3 THANK YOU FOR THE PHONE < PROPFIRST > YOU ARE AMAZING . 
I got my shit DOOONNNEEE . -proud of self- Though , it feels kinda strange not having anything to worry about now . Ah well , probably won't last long ... kaybye :D 
IS A LICENSED DRIVER WOOOO :D 
Now we speak with ruined tongues and the words we say aren't meant for anyone . 
Fuck stores that only go up to large . 
looks really pretty . 
RAIN TOMORROW ?! Weather.com, please don't be lying to me again . 
saw lots of great people today <3 
FLICKR I WILL END YOU 
Now this is my kind of weather <3 
I want to jump out of my skin and watch the clouds . 
Old Spice commercials are terrifying . 
is nucking futs .
