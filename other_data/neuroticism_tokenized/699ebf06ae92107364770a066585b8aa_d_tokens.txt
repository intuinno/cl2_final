I'm finally getting on Facebook more ! 
Welcome to the hotel california Such a lovely place . I love music <3 Music lifts the soul ! 
Props to < PROPMALE > for winning and for being so humble :) , I didn't think he'd last 2 ? minutes against < PROPFIRST > ... almost didn't lol . < PROPFIRST > was too tired by the time the 2nd round started , he put all of his energy into the 1st round . 
Dancing is the best workout =) 
Toy Story 3 is magical , I'ts simply amazing ! It reminds me of my childhood since i sorta grew up with it . It's the best Toy Story movie by far ! Definitely a MUST SEE ! =) 
I'm getting ready for my dad's dinner \party\ " Happy Birthday Daddy !!! =) " 
Damn I busted my ass < PROPMALE > diving XD I shoulda landed on my feet , not my butt Hahaha it was fun , i liked swinging off the rope

Looking for a Catwoman costume online ... hey Halloween's not that far away is it ? =)

I feel accomplished for making a high score on my AP exam ! That just motivates me to keep trying my best =) I'm gonna head to the Car show in a bit . 
& you know the end is near when < PROPFIRST > Bieber and Miley < PROPMALE > have millions of hundreds of views on youtube and great artists only have a couple of views .. 
I am way too hyper right now , nothing can tame me at the moment , I feel like a wild beast XD hahaha 
I hate the dentist my mouth is sore :/ 
Ready to have fun this weekend =) 
Last night was fun at \Chicas Bonitas\ " a lot of dancing and laughing took place =) what more can you ask for ? " 
Cleaning is so boring especially when you have no music to listen to . I had to sing to keep myself entertained , I sang just about every genre of music from \Every < PROPFEMALE > has it's thorn\ " to \ " All my bitches love me All All my bitches love me\ " to the National Anthem .. FML ! " 
You've got to try if you want to fly =) 
Everyone views the world in such a COMPLETELY different way . True friendship is when you settle your differences & try to understand and care for someone who views the world in a completely different way than you do =) 
Forever young I wanna be !!! Forever young ... Do you really want to live forever & ever & ever ? =) 
Movies- $9.00 Six Flags- $50.00 , Floating on my back in the San < PROPMALE > river as if I have no care in the world , PRICELESS ; a feeling like no other ! =) 
Like this and I'll tell you my first Impression of you , what I like about you , dislike , and a confession =) 
The only thing you have to fear is fear it'self . Don't feed into fear ; it is a weakness . Choose to follow your heart instead <3 
Always treat your woman like a lady , never get too old to call her BABY , and LOVE LIKE CRAZY <3

Robbie : I remember we went to the Grand Canyon one time . We were flying there and I'd never been there before and < PROPFEMALE > had , so you would think that she would give me the window seat but she didn't and ... not that that's a big deal , you know . It's just there were a lot of little things like that . I know that sounds stupid ... \ 
Julia : Not at all . I think it's the little things that count <3 
Logics > Emotions any day . Emotions never let you think with a clear mind ...

Had a blast with my girls shopping at < PROPMALE > Creek yesterday & miss my baby :D 
In my own world , getting things done , and not minding it one bit :) 
My mom & I were gonna adopt a little chihuahua today .. he was a little lost dog with no direction & no collar , we gave it food & water & came back for it later but some Asian guy scared him off :/ I was so excited .. I really wanted to keep him . 
& while I thrive in academics , my social life slowly crumbles :/ \Senior year is your easiest year\ " MY ASS ! & what i think about my youth is that I can't let it slip away ; I will never get a < PROPMALE > to re-live these experiences . You're only 18 once ... right ? " 
I hate \companies\ " that seem too good to be true & then they end up being a BIG FAT SCAM ! They thrive out of taking other people's money with nothing valuable in return . Naw fuck that I'm not falling for that ishh .. " 
Senioritis is starting to kick in ... 
NEXT TIME ? there won't be a next time .. I apologize even though I know it's lies ... -Eminem 
True happiness consists of achieving something we have wanted for a long time :D

The only real possessions we have in this life is our mind , heart , and time . 
I was so satisfied when I killed the UGLIEST fattest roach ...... until it came back from the dead & started walking again FML 
Some guys are like little kids when they get a new toy . Once they receive that brand new toy they give it all of their attention . But after a while they take for granted the value of the toy , neglect it , and don't show they care for it any longer ... BUT once their toy is in jeopardy of being TAKEN AWAY from another kid ... then that's when they'll fight to have it back . 
Be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it 
It happens to everyone as they grow up . \ 
You find out who you are and what you want , and then you realize that \ 
people you've known forever don't see things the way you do . So you keep\ 
the wonderful MEMORIES , but find yourself MOVING ON :D 
PROOOOO .... CRAAAAASTIIINATIOON is a bitch :) 
Imperfection is beauty , madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring . 
Who wants to go get breakfast with me ? I know it's noon but who cares =P 
What I really meant to say is I'm sorry for the way I am .... I never meant to be so cold 
DNA model almost done ;) gotta keep this kind of productivity going .... I have too many plans & can't throw away all of my hard work 
If I were you I'd manage to AVOID the invitation of PROMISED LOVE that CAN'T keep up with your ADORATION .... Just use your head and in the end you'll find your inspiration to choose your steps and won't REGRET this kind of AGGRAVATION . 
Feeling fabulous , lets see what kind of trouble I can get into tonight ;D

The greatest feeling is achieving something you never thought possible :) 
True love is like a ghost , which everyone talks about but few have actually seen \ 
( we're all in love with the IDEA of being in love ) 
God bless you < PROPFEMALE > cause youre gonna NEED it ! =) 
“We are all just prisoners here of our own device” 
& when you least know it , it hits you like a shot of whiskey 
One of the best feelings is catching up with old friends <3

“There are only two things in this world : wonderful , visceral , sexy sex ; and death . Horrible , boring death . ” lmao xD 
\Nobody knows me I'm cold ... walk down this road all alone . It's no one's fault but my own ... it's the path I've chosen to go .... frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever \""

she's a wild thang <3 
Black Swan was SPEC(fucken)TACULAR xD best movie I've seen in a long time and definitely in my top 5 all-time favorites . < PROPFEMALE > Portman isn't just a great actress , but also my inspiration . 
Friendship > Romance . If you can get both ... great :D if you HAVE to choose either one or the other : friendship . 
Dream . Imagine . Believe . It's not my knowledge that got me to where I am , but rather my unwavering faith <3 
\Most girls I meet are quite savage ... always tryna ' grab up on my package\

Need a moment ?... crunch * chew it over with Twix :) 
\I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping .. While my guitar gently weeps \ 
Sometimes in sports , games , & life in general you have to use your gut feeling . Over-analyzing a situation can cause great fear . Clearing your mind of everything & having the right attitude is all you will need :) 
I hope my love < PROPFIRST > Garza is having a wonderful birthday =) 
Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself , and know that everything in this life has purpose . There are no mistakes , no coincidences . All events are blessings from above .
