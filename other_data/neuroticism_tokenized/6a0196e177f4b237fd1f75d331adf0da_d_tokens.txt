Happy new year everyone !! 

Feels like total shit . SUDS = 35 
I miss my Boston brethren already . Home still doesn't feel like home just yet . Maybe when I'm not sleep deprived , sick , emotionally drained , and overloaded I'll feel better . Time to vegetate ! 
misses the Boston crew . < PROPFIRST > B , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Andrew ,..... Elise , < PROPFIRST > R , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , Kristjana , Harlen , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > S , < PROPFEMALE > and some of the you others whose names escape me at the moment . I even miss < PROPFEMALE > D even though she doesn't miss me . Some I don't miss quite so much . You know who you are .... well , you probably can't read this . 
Just waiting for the anime convention this weekend ! 
Can't believe we're in a near-blizzard state right now when it was 70 and < PROPFEMALE > yesterday . 
Just got back from my first anime convention . It was at least half the way I thought it would be . 
School starts up again today . EMOTICON WARNING ! (-_-) 
Just went to my second anime convention . A $25 entry fee was in no way justified by the content l :( 
Between two capstone courses , a demanding online class , psych , work , finding a summer job , and going through the application and transition process to a university AGAIN , I have no idea how I'm going to survive this quarter . I'd kill to have the ability to control time right now l : ( 
YAYS , COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS !!!!!!!! 
Need Help . I'm turning 21 soon and have no idea of what I could do to < PROPFIRST > the occasion . Any ideas other than solely getting blackout drunk ? 
He's a hero . Gonna take pollution DOWN TO ZERO ! 
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS CAPTAIN PLANET ! 
Thank you to everyone for your happy birthday wishes yesterday ... except for Wahab . We all know nobody can play the skin flute with a < PROPFEMALE > quite like yours . Anyways , I didn't get too rowdy but I enjoyed myself . It's nice to know you guys still think of me even though I don't see you all regularly . 
just moved into his apartment in Oxford ! I hope Miami University goes smoothly as well . 
Ever watch a tree attack a random stranger ? Simply amazing . 
Dear President Obama : While we are at it , can we go ahead & put a beautiful statue of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Oswald on the grassy knoll in < PROPFIRST > & maybe even throw a huge celebration shrine over the < PROPFEMALE > Harbor monument in honor of the Japanese victory that took place there . Yes , Mr. President , IT IS THE SAME THING as allowing a mosque to be built at Ground zero . ~~~ COPY & REPOST IF YOU AGREE ~~~ 
Just walked into a sign on my way to class today ... hopefully not a clear indicator of how the rest of the day will go . 
greatly dislikes having to teach himself Thermodynamics week after week :( 
Oh Caffeine and Vitamin B , never again will I rely on your wonderous ability to keep me energized for the sake of homework , for as much as you help me , you hinder me even more . 
Grab a 6-pack and a lawn chair , there's a tornado comin'! 
If Wednesday was a person , I would punch it in the face ... at least until the semester is over . 
Put\ 
this in your status if you or someone you love has been eaten by a \ 
velociraptor . It is time to let the silent victims everywhere know that \ 
there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for \ 
vicious sport . Velociraptors are , after all , kind of upstoppable . \ 
... Sadly , only 93% of people won't repost this . 
Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Michigan Fan : ( < PROPMALE > Mangas)\ 
Being a Wolverine Fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . \ 
There is still no known cure for MF and sympathy does not help , but we\ 
can raise awareness . 100% of OSU fans will repost this ... simply\ 
because WE know how to copy and paste as well as tie our shoes . 
Happy Halloween Everyone ! 
vehemently dislikes being sick . 
I hate the new facebook profile interface . It's difficult to find things now . 
SEC who ? 
absolutely hates when people drive . 0043862 mph when there's only half a milimeter of snow on the ground . 
Everyone calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat ! REMEMBER : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! Feel free to Repost if you feel the same ! 
... damn you Saturday class 
Note to self : NEVER eat the blazin ' wings at BW3's ... you'll end up paying for it at least thrice . 
Let it snow , let it snow , let it snow ... if for no other reason than it could get me out of a boatload of schoolwork tomorrow . 
Great job < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera . You successfully managed to destroy the < PROPFEMALE > Spangled Banner not only in terms of sound , but lyrically as well . 
And to think , I was hangin ' with my good friends < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > at O'-House just this exact time last year ... man how time flies ... 
OMFG ...... Saturday class is so boring and painful ! 
Just threw up in the shower this morning ......... \ 
Today is going to go wonderfully ! 
NO MORE SATURDAY CLASS !... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 
... man I hate being sick . 
Wow , green beer day was pretty messed up . 
* Insert Expletive * ... I have to go back to Oxford tonight :( 
Damn , unfortunately my 12 year old dog passed away today . \ 
Rest in peace Abbigail , you will be missed . 
Is extremely less than happy today . I just found out about an hour ago that a renegade band of douchebags broke into and ransacked my house making off with what is largely still unknown . Unfortunately I was not there because I would have taken full advantage of the castle doctrine . 
Wonder how many people read my status . You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .. Be a good sport and play along ... 
BILLY'S GOT HIS BEER GOGGLES ON !
