Truthfulness . He will never willingly tolerate an untruth , but will hate it as much as he loves truth . ... And is there anything more closely connected with wisdom than truth ? ( Plato ) 
When you lose someone you love , you die too , and you wait around for your body to catch up . 
You are young , my son , and , as the years go by , time will change and even reverse many of your present opinions . Refrain therefore awhile from setting yourself up as a judge of the highest matters . ( Plato ) 
Human behavior flows from three main sources : < PROPFEMALE > , emotion , and knowledge . ( Plato ) 
\The wise man does not expose himself \ 
\Ordinary people seem not to realize that those who really apply themselves in the right way to philosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death . \ " ( Socrates ) " 
Fairest and dearest , your wrath and anger are more heavy than I can bear ; but learn that I cannot tell what you wish me to say without sinning against my honour too grievously ( < PROPFEMALE > de < PROPFEMALE > ) 
I was angry with my friend : I told my wrath , my wrath did end . I was angry with my foe : I told it not , my wrath did grow . 
Forfeit the game before somebody else takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame , cover up your face you can't run the race the pace is too fast you just won't last 
\The nice part about being a pessimist is that you are constantly being either proven right or pleasantly surprised . \ " ( < PROPFIRST > Will ) " 
\A pessimist is a person who has had to listen to too many optimists . \ " ( < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ) "

\Thinking : the talking of the soul with itself . \ " ( Plato ) " 
\The fear really hits you . That's what you feel first . And then it's the anger and frustration . Part of the problem is how little we understand about the ultimate betrayal of the body when it rebels against itself . \ " ( < PROPFIRST > Bronson ) " 
\Always remember others may hate you but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them . And then you destroy yourself . \ " ( < PROPFIRST > Milhouse Nixon ) " 
No one achieves frivolity straight off . It is a privilege and an < PROPMALE > ; it is the pursuit of the superficial by those who , having discerned the impossibility of any certitude , have conceived a disgust for such things ; it is the escape far from one abyss or another which , being by nature bottomless , can lead nowhere . ( E . M . Cioran ) 
I'm gon be here after the smoke dye down , \ 
Insomnia style I won't lye down , \

Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss . \

\At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic . \ " ( Naguib Mahfouz ) " 
Out , out , brief candle ! \ 
Life’s but a walking shadow , a poor player\ 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage\ 
And then is heard no more ; it is a tale\ 
Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , \ 
Signifying nothing .
