Sorry that you feel that way\ 
The only thing there is to say\ 
Every silver lining's got a , Touch of grey 
New Years Resolution = Make it to the top !

Hey < PROPFEMALE > , I remember your name . I left a dozen roses on your grave today . I'm in the grass on my knees , wipe the leaves away . I just came to talk for a while . I got some things I need to say . Now that it's over , I just wanna hold her . I'd give up all the world to see , That little piece of heaven looking back at me ... 
My ass has stayed up too late but I'm not sleepy at all .. ohh wells , night 
I went to bed and I was thinking about you <3 | hmm .. my dumbass papaw called and woke me up .. I need to start cutting off my phone at night .. 
Taking my time , \

Got myself < PROPMALE > up on you . \ 
Seems to me , \ 
you dont want to talk about it . \ 
you just turn your pretty head and walk away . 
She could take it back , she might take it back someday .. 
Just call me a tragic comic because I am in love with you . / Hmm .. laying here going to write some more . 
And if I ever got another < PROPMALE > , I'd still ask her to dance , because kept me waiting <3 
Hmm .. currently at church .. I hate this place . Can't wait to go home and relax the rest of my vacation .. 
Love and hate get it wrong\ 
Cut me right back down to size\ 
Sleep the day let it fade\ 
Who was there to take your place\ 
No one knows never will\ 
Mostly me but mostly you\ 
Do you say do you do\ 
When it all comes down\ 
Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud\ 
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need \ 
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud\ 
It's taken me all this all this time 
Would you ... come on and .... get down with the sickness ? 
Please join the Society of Awesomeness ! 
What makes you think you're the one , who can laugh without cryin' ? What makes you think you're the one , who can live without dyin' ? Every little bit ... is there .. to see Every little bit ... of you ... and me What makes you think I'm the one , who'll be there when you're callin' ?

State of love and trust as I busted down the pretext , Since their plays and preachers went to heaven and to court , uh huh , And the signs are passin ' , grip the wheel , can't read it , Sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands ... hands ... yeah , And I listen for the voice inside my head , Nothin ' , I'll do this one myself ... 
Just had a memory trip =] 
=[ 
I tested my IQ an I have 130 :) 
After my homework I'm tempted to write another song , I haven't in a while and need to . Give me some serious subjects on what I should write . Only ROCK ideas !!!! No rap or hip hop or whatever . Or country ... 
My song is coming along great . It should be finished by tonight or tomorrow :D 
I pray to God above for no school 
Ask or tell me anything ... please ? www.formspring.me/drfeelgood2013 
Court today , won't be at school . Wish me luck ! 
We get some rules to follow , That and this , These and those , No one knows ... We get these pills to swallow , How they stick , in your throat , Tastes like gold .... Oh , what you do to me .... No one knows .... 
My new obsession is Cartman's version of Poker Face lmao xD 
I wanted you to know my name , wish that you could read my mind , you are a ghost in my dreams . You're distracting my mind , see the secrets that I hide , and I'm just trying to avoid them ... I'll never forget somebody like you , I wanted to feel that you belonged to me .... 
Got a new number , please text and state your first and last name . 276-782-0736 
Babe , I'll be a flat liner for a ..... heartkiller ;] 
She eats me like a Piscies when we do it , I've been locked inside your bathroom for three months , I've been drawn into your skanky clothing choice , I wish I could do you faster when you turn fat ....... lmao ! I love making fun of Nirvana songs :) 
Wow Euphoria by W.A.S.P. is amazing ! Though only an instrumental , it has such an eerie , but calming effect =] 
My new song is done . Please IM or comment me if you wish to read it ! 
Nothing like a little bit of Candlebox to sooth the soul 
I won't be at school today ... I hurt too much =[ 
So I’ll shun out the world in an instant , As long as you’re here by my side . You fill my whole life with a feeling ... Serene , and love’s true meaning ... 
Finally found the perfect chords for my new song on guitar . Just need to finish an easy as hell bassline and this thing should be good to go ! 
Finally back online !!!!!!! 
\Like\ " if you want a Christian side hug xD " 
Haha so here's the deal , < PROPFEMALE > Enfield is giving her fantasy people my last name and I'm extremely pissed ! Will my dear friends give me a hand to rid of them ? Thanks :) 
Hey guys and gals ! Ya'll mind visiting the profiles of < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > Calahan and report them as fakes so they can get deleted ? I don't appreciate my last name being used for fake people . I'd appreciate it :) 
I currently have \Stan\ " by Eminem stuck in my head . Dido has such a great voice in that ! Hmm ... it'd be better if Eminem didn't talk through it and just kinda sang along haha :P " 
And now we're grown up orphans , that never knew their names . We don't belong to no one , that's a shame . But if you could hide beside me , maybe for a while . And I won't tell no one your name ..... And I won't tell ' em your name ..... 
Happy Mother's Day mom ! Don't know what I'd do without you ! I love you ! 
And he says what do you , love to do ? Outside your world , Who spends time with you ? \ 
Whom do you love , when you're not working ? Sweet girl ... 
Taste the love , The lucifer's magic that makes you numb . The passion and all the pain are one , You're sleeping in the fire ... Taste the love , the lucifer's magic that makes you numb , You feel what it does and you're drunk on love . You're sleeping in the fire ... 
I got my learner's today . Gonna start driving tomorrow 
My first time on the road ... pretty great ! minus hitting 3 mailboxes and two small children ... 
My mamaw is not doing good at all , she might not live much longer . Please pray for her . 
Went driving for about an hour today . I done almost perfect ! I went from Blevins ' Grocery to Riverside , to N ***** Holler ( no joke , real road ) and went up on Iron Mountain and took the back way home 
Here's to the pain , the light of the oncoming train . Come on , ode to solitude in chains . Here's to the pain as always heaven in flames now bleeding . Ode to solitude in chains .... 
Well since people are posting < PROPFIRST > scores on here ..... 600 on my geometry and my world history . BAM ! haha 
She paints her eyes as black as night now , Pulls those shades down tight . Yeah , she gives a smile when the pain comes , The pains gonna make everything alright . Says she talks to angels , They call her out by her name . She talks to angels , Says they call her out by her name . 
Damn it < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! I'm obsessed with \Always on My Mind\ " and starting to question life .... hmm ... " 
Everybody remember < PROPMALE > Blevins , he got into a wreck earlier and broke his right leg and left elbow 
You're my blue sky , you're my < PROPFEMALE > day . Lord , you know it makes me high when you turn your love my way ...... turn your love my way , yeah . 
Everytime that you make me smile , it's the same old way it used to be , and that's enough for me . Everytime that sleep don't come , it's the same old pain that used to be , and that's enough for me ... 
Another turning point , a fork stuck in the road . Time grabs you by the wrist , directs you where to go . So make the best of this test , and don't ask why . It's not a question , but a lesson learned in time . It's something unpredictable , but in the end is right . I hope you had the time of your life . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Poston . I love you mamaw . Im not sad but happy youre in a better place . Say hello to God for me . :') 
Titties !!!! 
I'm now determined to have \Dead by popular demnad\ " engraved on my headstone xD " 
I'm now determined to have \Dead by popular demand\ " engraved on my headstone xD " 
Well I took a little ride through the pouring rain , to think about the casualties of your exchange . Cause what you said , ain't what you do , you know you live by the words you choose . Was it him ? Was it me ? Were his lies easier than my truth to believe ? 
' Cause when the loving starts , and the lights go down . And there's not another living soul around . You woo me until the sun comes up , and you say that you love me . 
* cough * * cough * I love you * cough * * sniffle * ;) 
Silly emos ! Razorblades are made for shaving , not slitting your wrists cause no one loves you ! :D

Say you stand , by your man . Tell me something , I don't understand . You said you love me and that's a fact . Then you left me , said you felt trapped . Well some things you can explain away , but the heartache's in me till this day . Did you stand by me ? No , not at all . Did you stand by me ? No way . 
Homosexuality is a progressive mental illness in which the sufferer is overcome by sexual feelings for others of the same sex . Often as the sufferer comes of age , the level of faggotry begins to slope up in the form of a quadratic function { f(faggot) = ax2+bx+c } , rather than the typical linear model predicted by researchers and other faggots of the like . 
Damn ... what I wouldn't give to talk to you again ... it's been so long ... I'm sorry ... * sigh * 
According to an anonymous report , a girl named < PROPFEMALE > was struck by a \smooth\ " criminal on Sunday . "

Oh , didn't I , didn't I , didn't I see you cryin ? 
I think I'm going out of my mind ... literally I'm so freakin confused right now ...

I have so much on my mind .. it sucks ! I never get any sleep anymore ..

I walk the thin line between insanity and lovin ' you 
Take another second . Turn your back on me and make believe , that you're always happy . It's safe to say , you were never alive , a big part of you has died and by the way , I hope you're satisfied . I'm alive , for you , I'm awake . Because of you I'm alive . Told you I'm awake , swallowing you ! 
I'd enjoy some texts ! Especially from new people :D 276-782-0736

I fell in love with the girl at The Rock Show <3

Ahh thats the best ive slept in months ! Text it :3 
The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting\ 
Could it be that we have been this way before\ 
I know you don't think that I am trying\ 
I know you're wearing thin down to the core\ 
But hold your breathe\ 
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you\ 
Over again\ 
Don't make me change my mind\ 
Or I wont live to see another day\ 
I swear it's true\ 
Because a girl like you is impossible to find 
She makes me feel like it's raining outside\ 
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside\ 
I'm always nervous on , days like this like the prom\ 
I get too scared to move , cause I'm a fuckin ' boy

No one knows what it's like , to be the bad man , to be the sad man ... behind blue eyes 
Currently writting a new song ! 
You missed the winter and it followed you back home \ 
Where sun kissed the crimson footsteps in the melting snow \ 
We are doing our best to disown the < PROPFEMALE > mean \ 
By disacts of cruelty in the name of beauty to be free \ 
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo \ 
We're dancing with tags on our toes \ 
I saved my last breath for your window \ 
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral 
Id love for some texts :) 
\You’re just a silhouette in slow motion\ 
Learned more about life . Loved . Hated . Lost a lot . Gained nothing . A year of broken dreams and promises . A year of the economy going down . A year where I've expressed myself more artistically than any before . A year I will raise my right hand , raise the middle finger , and shine a salute to 2010 . 
Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight . What will be , will be . Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight . But don't forget about me . Ohh the phantoms , crawl out of the night . Hoping tomorrow will never come , for you and I <3 
It was a blue letter\ 
She wrote to me\ 
It's silver words she told\ 
Wanna be on the road to paradise\ 
I wanna lover who don't get old . \ 
Do I read a message in your eyes\ 
You wanna love to stay another night\ 
Baby when your day goes down\ 
I won't be waitin ' around for you . <3

Hoping the daylight will never come\ 
For you and I
