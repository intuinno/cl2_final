dexters pretty amazing 
so i just volunteered at therapeutic integration at trellis services . really fun stuff . cant believe ill be getting $10 an hour for this in the summer possibly ... 
trellis time :D 
walking dead never ceases to amaze me 
theres a crack in the edge of the end of the world . where i will sit with my love in its flourescent swirl . eat us up , break it down to the tiniest cell . in our room with a view and a window to hell . where those who bury bodies in their barrels of fun . will be marched through museums that display what theyve done . shot up through the sky by a cannon of sin . who will reluctantly let them in 
awesome . coincidentally i just started feeling really stuffed up on band practice day . a week before possible coffeehouse . cool . 
so nevermind ... false alarm . my voice was fine . however we cant play at coffeehouse now . goddammit henry ... you and your previously unmentioned nyc school trips . 
so i havent skateboarded for several years . i just decided to borrow a friends and we rode around a bunch . realized i miss it . but cant remember where i put mine now ... shit . 
goddammit rain . i was seriously going to skateboard today . 
YAAAY HEALTH CARE . ITS ALIIIIIIIVE . 
so i just discovered that i cant work at trellis until im 18 . frowny face . 
i love the fact that people i dont know at all are becoming fans of my band , like this random british kid . and we dont even have any songs actually posted yet . WE MUST BE AMAZING . 
so , cutter videan . you like stealing other peoples band names , and making shitty music under them for your solo project nobody cares about that probably uses garageband for most of the instruments/effects ? thats cool bro , thats cool . only 3 fans ? thats interesting . okay . CHANGE YOUR NAME . OR JUST STOP . YOURE NOT DOING IT RIGHT . 
so i loved coffeehouse . feel pretty good about it . moshpit was superb . 
fabulous night . there was glowsticks and groping involved . 
lovin ' in defense of the genre . 
so just fyi , hot tub time machine was actually a pretty good movie . \ITS SO INCREDIBLY BLACK \""

Damn . Sporcle's really addicting/distracting . 
sixteen names on my list , but none of them could ever get me hot like this . 
mall/towsonfest was fuuun :3 
round in circles , lets start over . 
is getting annoyed by these hot optical illusion videos . 
Eat , sleep , fuck and flee . In four words that's me . 
SAY ANYTHING WAS INCREDIBLE . I just wish they played longer . Gotta go see them sometime when they're headlining . They sounded amazing . 
Similar to the infamous hot optical illusion videos , I have now received an AWESOME WORKOUT VIDEO . FOR TIGHT BUNS . Aw yeah . I'mma get me some tight buns with this shit . THANKS . jklolgotohellagain . 
Passing slowly through a vector , damp with fog the bog the grows the former business sector . With my laugh , my lone companion , only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon . Drink the colors of the nighttime . If you were wrong then I was right and this will be the right time . I'll display my disaffection . You grind me up , you spit me out , out across the city loud and proud in your direction . 
is actually rather enjoying the poetry unit in English . 
This is fucking ecstasy , this is fucking leprosy , it's like they're fucking testing me , this is fucking ecstasy . 
I like how basically the first questions that came up when I created a formspring were about my sexuality ... 
FRIDAAAAAAY . \ 
I'm supposed to go to Iron Man 2 with people , but I want to somehow throw a band practice together instead . Hmmm . 
I saw the ocean envelop the sky and blot out the sun on the day that we died . The former , the latter , and all in between , they were vanquished by Loki the fiend . Do you remember me ? The one that you loathed when he set you free . Do you remember me ? The one with whom you fell beneath the sea . 
formspring isnt working =[ 
BAND PRACTICE :D 
NARWHALS SWIMMIN IN THE OCEAN CAUSIN A COMMOTION . 
is watchin ' the Church Channel nightly . 
There's something in the way you people smell , like you've got no soul at all . 
I watched my yellow cat invade my red cat in the yard . The feline war has raged for years , so I'd assume it'd be too hard for me to drive my foot between them . I would never risk the scratch just to prove to one or both of them a cat is just a cat . 
I just don't get it . 
Writing a sonnet :D 
I comb the crowd , I pick you out , my mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out . It starts eyes closed , to fingers crossed , to I swear , I say . 
CAN YOU ERASE THE DOUBT 
IT SHOULD BE A FRIDAY 
is biding his time until the time is right . 
RIP DIO :( 
loves the new AOAA album :D 
is another cog in the murder machine . 
She made me wanna take the blade to my skin and tear out the machine she installed from within 
Some foreign guy just messaged me in a language I don't know at all . I think I'll just pretend I didn't get it or something . 
SO . MUCH . MATH . HOMEWORK . NONE OF WHICH I REALLY UNDERSTAND 
I think everyone should not be dicks to people because of their musical preferences . Stop being so narrow-minded and admit that the only kind of music you happen to like is not actually the only good music out there . It's all very subjective . 
wants to see MacGruber 
Cheer Up Emo Kid is amazaziiing 
Wow . People care a little too much about my sexual preferences . 
misses MCR . They'd better release that goddamn album soon . 
How did we do at Coffeehouse ?! 
Too much essay , but still happy somehow ^_^ 
You and me , we'll all go down in history , with a sad statue of < PROPFEMALE > and a generation that didn't agree .

Woe coverage ^_^ 
There's a pretty awesome Get Up Kids concert on On Demand . Just so y'know . 
Summer swallowed us whole , waited for you to come around . 
I should study but I wanna play TF2 really bad 
Everyone's looking for relief , United States versus disbelief , mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle . 
Maybe someday we together can be the < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > of all I've seen 
There's a lot of CD's I need to buy . 
Well shit . I have nothing to do for most of the weekend . You know what that means . TF2 . And guitar . And sleeping . 
Mall was fuuuun :D 
I fucked someone with words , broke a promise . You forgave but you won't forget . I pray the day will come when you see I was numb , till you burned me with your cigarette . 
I CANT WAIT FOR YOU TO SHUT ME UP 
I hope this retard on formspring dies a horribly slow and painful death . 
I have a new phone . AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR < PROPFIRST > IN AN ANNOYING GROUP . Why is this ? Because I'm not lazy and I manually transferred all of my contacts from my old phone to the new one . It's not that hard , people . 
Wants to do Cemetery Drive , Disenchanted , or maybe Blood for the MCR cover contest :D 
There are way too many demomen in the world . 
misses band practices . Hopefully I can fix that this weekend :D 
Well fuck . I feel awful .

I sorta wanna listen to the Used more now for some reason . 
Epic D&D sesh . 
Four Minute Mile , when given time to grow on you is an amazing album ... 
Everybody knows beneath your clothes , staring at your toes is just a pose 
Why am I never hungry ? 
Was I born to sink into this couch and watch my whole world bleed its purpose out ? Around the insects follow patterns to their deaths while I waste my precious breath on a second guess 
Guitar Hero 6 looks like it'll have good song list :D 
HOLYSHIT\

And started workin ' at Trellis . \ 
Good day . \ 
Made up for yesterday pretty much . 
Cast Away was amazing , why hadn't I seenit yet ? 
These nightmares are so weird\ 
It's like I'm drowning at the bottom of a bottle of beer\ 
That my father sips between the humorous quips \ 
Of the late night comedy news shows he frequents\ 
And I wake up\ 
With the devil in my sheets\ 
Hiked up to her shoulders\ 
Asking was it good for me 
Today was ... \ 
Interesting at best . 
Confusing extreme highs and lows are confusing 
And even if your whisper eats my ear , your voice shall be the only song I long to hear 
Yeah\ 
Say Anything is definitely my favorite band ever 
I AM THE MILKMAN\ 
MY MILK IS DELICIOUS 
Fuckin ' formspring , why won't it work

You're the echoes of my everything\ 
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night\ 
You're the laziness of afternoon\ 
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom\ 
You're the leaky sink of sentiment\ 
You're the failed attempts I never could forget\ 
You're the metaphors I can't create to comprehend this curse that I call love 
wants to go to Vans Warped to see Motion City Soundtrack Mayday Parade and Sum 41

Let's get fucked up and die\ 
I'm speaking figuratively of course

Apparently I'm not supposed to brush my hair with a paintbrush or a toothbrush\ 
WHO KNEW 
Assuming that all things are equal\ 
Who'd want to be men of the people\ 
When there's people like you

Got me some Paramore , Placebo , Nirvana , Motion City Soundtrack and Dropkick Murphys 
< PROPFIRST > Hopppus- backing vox on Hangman\

Again , wow . Amazazing 
Dammit Valve , give me the Polycount update faster 
My name is < PROPFIRST > Daker . 
I gotta buy some Blue October 
Why is Steam down D: 
Since I was born I started to decay\ 
Now nothing ever ever goes my way 
coverin ' some Teenage Angst 
I miss band practices\ 
a lot 
Damn\ 
Get Up Kids actually have new stuff\ 
and they still sound as good as they did years ago 
Yes Man was amazing :D 
Men Who Stare At Goats was also amazing \ 
Clooney never fails 
I hate the ocean , theme parks and airplanes , talking with strangers , waiting in line 
Why do people feel the need to make ridiculously low-quality videos with their phones at every concert they go to ? \ 
Just enjoy the music for chrissake 
I'm sprinting yet I stride\ 
My satchel filled with files\ 
The secrets of the tribe\ 
The cameras follow me for miles\ 
Born a slave in 1984\ 
Discovered that my life is just a record they performed 
\So basically this is it ... < PROPFEMALE > Lewinsky and I are going into the bag-making industry together ... \ 
Inception was incredible . \ 
Believe the hype . \ 
Oh and also it's really not that confusing , seriously 
They strapped me to the roof\ 
And they cut right through me\ 
Digging through my wounds\ 
I watched them hopelessly and choke\ 
Where are my pills where is my former lover\ 
I've been betrayed by everyone I know , don't blow my feeble cover 
I've read about the afterlife but I've never really lived 
Well . Outsourced was really good . \ 
And < PROPFIRST > brought home an adorable baby duck from work yesterday . \ 
I just got back from work to find out that it died . \ 
Today suddenly sucks . Off to write lyrics now . 
Wrote a song . And for once I actually feel pretty good about it . 
Band practice needs to happen sooner\ 
And just generally more often 
Tomorrow will be terrible 
Well , my prediction was partially correct . First half was horrible , second half almost made up for it 
Today was awesome . < PROPMALE > with Mr Katzzz 
So United States of < PROPFEMALE > is an awesome show 
Dinner For Schmucks was pretty gewwwd 
That was the most fun I've had just playing guitar in a while\ 
Can't wait for practice :D 
More Say Anything coveraggge 
My voice is getting betterrr\ 
This pleases me 
Going out to breakfast with people I don't know or something 
Fun practice . \ 
Anyone else goin ' to the mall tomorrow ?! 
I think < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is pretty much spot on with the idea of organized religion , drugs , power , money , and time being symbols of the downfall of man 
Fun mall times with the band and other people 
I need to get an MSI skate deck , like now 
A block- Philosophy\ 
B block- free\ 
C block- Precalc ( Schlenger)\ 
D block- Applied Chem\ 
E block- US & World ( Lampadarios)\ 
F block- French 3 ( Bartlett)\ 
L block- Music Theory I\ 
WHO HAS CLASSES WITH MEH 
Lost 12 hours of my day\ 
But it's okay\ 
Just black it out 
I know we'll be just fine when we learn to love the ride 
Why does Heavy Rain have to be a PS3 exclusive 
suddenly has a craving for some Twilight Zone 
needs to get some more Counting Crows 
started reading < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim\ 
And it's pretty much as great as I thought it'd be 
My weekend : D&D , hangin ' with Mr Latman , more D&D , and mall\ 
Fun stuffs 
It's like a bad dream , something from the back of a magazine\ 
Black and white and cheaply put together like a slasher film\ 
Torn in opposite directions , the plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous 
got his last paycheck . \ 
RECORD & TAPE TRADERS TIME . 
seeing AFI and Green Day tomorrow :D 
Okay , that has to be the best concert I've ever been to 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim tomorrow ^_^ 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was actually really good 
So apparently Beck helped with the Sex Bob-Omb songs . How did I not notice this 
just wrote quite an awesome song 
Manchester Orchestra is kind of amazing 
is on a roll . Wrote another really good song . A productive week indeed so far :D 
Another productive songwriting day with < PROPFIRST > Pulliasss . \ 
Also I had mah physical . Apparently I've lost weight and haven't really grown at all . 
Whoa . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is the new American Idol judge . Wtf 
It's been a good year\ 
A good new beginning\ 
I'm through with the old school\ 
So let's commence the winning\ 
I've been a good little worker bee\ 
I deserve a gold < PROPFEMALE > 
Band practice was gewwwd\ 
Have to go shopping for school supplies nao . D&D tonight though :D

I just need 100 dollars 
Band practiceee 
Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind was just ... incredible . \ 
I recommend it to anyone . 
I'm going back to 505\ 
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive\ 
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side\ 
With your hands between your thighs and a smile 
If my life had a face I would punch it 
finished an essay and is now lovin ' him some < PROPMALE >

Oh my god ... Sandman is being made into a tv series . this had better not suck

DRFE5TGY7HU O9IUY76T5R34EW\ 
HAPPY KEYBOARDHEADBASHSTATUS DAY 
New MCR album . November 22 . Although it's impossible to wait that long . 
Okay wtf . MCR is touring in Europe first . \ 
No American tour dates announced yet . \ 
Ghey 
This sentence is a lie . 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wR1MVdDmUA&NR=1&feature=fvwp Oh how I love At The Drive-In . Especially this album . 
needs to go get some Gaslight Anthem 
http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/news/future-say-anything this makes me so happy . Also : you too can talk to < PROPMALE > on the phone and shoot the shit , as well as get a full song written for you by him based on 2 paragraphs about anything you want him to write about for $75 . I might have to do it . As well as buy the signed 10 song tour-exclusive album at the upcoming Sonar show . 
just finished the 4th season of < PROPMALE > ... and oh my god . He never gets a fucking break . But seriously , it was great . Probably my favorite show out there at this point . Although Boardwalk Empire looks good so far . 
new MCR single on Tuesday :D 
Dnd was funnn\ 
Too bad I have a bigass essay to do tomorrow 
http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/8459/1285483319919.jpg 
I'll kick tomorrow\ 
Fight back at the pouring rain\ 
I'll send the weak ends down the drain down the drain 
Wolf Parade on November 5 @ Ram's Head <3 
This is something I have to do for myself 
Battle of the Bands went really well :D 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > left Say Anything D: \ 
At least < PROPMALE > Vasoli is touring with them instead 
saw Youth In Revolt , which was actually surprisingly quite good\ 
But then I saw Let the Right One In , which was just ... incredible . Beautiful . Definitely one of my favorite movies . \ 
I really don't want to see the remake now though -- no matter how good it is , I'll probably be slightly disappointed 
really needs to go to Ren Fest 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2Ylo-hBbkA 
The Guilt Show is great . Just so y'know . 
is lovin ' Mean Everything To Nothing 
If seeing is believing then believe that we have lost our eyes 
Ren Fest tomorrowww 
Ren Fest was pretty great , even though it took me like 3 hours to get there because of ridiculous traffic . Also : watch Boardwalk Empire . Do it now . 
is proud of MCR for turning down multiple offers to put one of their songs in a Twilight movie , simply because they pretty much hate it . 
doesn't care that it's 10/10/10 . At all . 
I should dye my hair blue or some shit . 
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101012/ap_on_re_us/us_gays_in_military Goodbye Don't Ask Don't Tell :D 
Happy belated National Coming Out Dayyy 
is rediscovering the greatness of < PROPMALE > Smith 
DnD , Halloween Party , and more Ren Fest . \ 
It's a good weekend . 
Snuggies are pretty much just backwards robes 
On my way nails broke and fell into the wishing well 
We've all got wood and nails\ 
And we sleep inside of this machine 
watchin ' some Back To The Future <3 
D&D tonight , gig tomorrow :] 
Back from the Ravens game 
needs to go get : Braid , Amnesia : Dark Descent , and American McGee's < PROPFEMALE > 
Menorah/Majora is such a great EP 
So I heave my breath at burning wax ' cause I know that spark ain't coming back 
So , apparently some possible actors to play < PROPMALE > Cobain in Heavier Than Heaven are Zac Efron and < PROPFIRST > Pattinson . On top of that , < PROPFIRST > Love is involved in some way with it . This movie is destined to fail . \ 
Oh , and another thing : THERE'S GOING TO BE A WATER FOR ELEPHANTS MOVIE . While it was a great book , < PROPFIRST > Pattinson is playing the lead , so again , it could be terrible . 
needs to go to Guitar Center to look for a 12-string electric acoustic . 
is catching up on some Walking Dead and can't wait for the series premiere on Halloween :D 
Put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > when it was obliterated by the Rebel terrorists . The Empire brings unity , but the Rebel terrorists continue to < PROPMALE > division and hatred . 2,471,647 Imperial citizens died in the terrorist attack against the Death < PROPFEMALE > . 93% of people won't copy/paste this . Will you be one of the few make this your status for at least one hour ? 
Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy , but the Empire continues to kill innocent civilians .... 93% of people won't copy/paste this . Make this your status for at least an hour . 
Half day , Subway , and new phone :D 
< PROPMALE > Wood was awsesome\ 
everyone should watch it\ 
I need to go see Plan 9 now 
Got a passport , Subway again , and fun times at the mall 
Watchin ' some < PROPMALE > Horror 
trick or treatin ' with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > , then Walking Dead 
aspires to be a banana Jedi 
Well . Walking Dead was surprisingly pretty damn good . It definitely did the comics justice so far . Highly recommended . 
wants to be a street performer . 
is going to miss this weekend quite a lot 
Sick day + < PROPFIRST > of the Dead 
Zach Galifianakis on Real Time was great XD 
Philosophy journal + People In Planes . Fuckyeah . 
Coffeehouse was great , and Wolf Parade + Ogre You Asshole ( who I got to meet and get signatures from ) @ Ram's Head with < PROPFIRST > was great :) \ 
Surprisingly I don't even mind that much that I missed D&D 
Well , Taking Woodstock was alright -- could've been a lot better though\ 
Regardless I actually really enjoyed it simply because I love Demetri < PROPFIRST > 
Hamlet essay >:[ 
needs to go to the Mutter Museum 
< PROPMALE > n cheese and Hamlet . Hellzyeah . 
new Cage The Elephant single on Tuesday ^_^ 
is loving Apologies to the < PROPFEMALE > Mary\ 
and is excited for the upcoming Thursday Full Collapse 10th anniversary tour 
needs to get an amp that'll actually be sufficient for a legitimate gig or something , while being semi-affordable . \ 
Any suggestions ? 
I was asleep in a hammock \ 
I was dreaming that I was a web\ 
I was a dreamcatcher hanging in the window of a minivan\ 
Parked along the water's edge\ 
I'd say that I was all alone 
Tomorrow :\ 
Autistic kids\ 
Baking cookies\ 
Say Anything/Motion City Soundtrack/Saves The Day concert\ 
Yeah , sounds like a pretty damn good day to me 
That was without a doubt the best concert I've ever been to . \ 
< PROPMALE > actually held the mic to me and let me sing a line <3 \ 
I even got the Painful Splits tour-exclusive album thingy\ 
So much more to say about it , but I have to go take a cold shower and drink several bottles of water now 
Painful Splits is actually pretty awesome imo 
So apparently my band Four Minute Mile is playing at the 9:30 Club with the Next Big Thing Tour . December 12 , 11am\ 
I still can't believe this happened 
Well , Trick R ' Treat was okay 
Anyone want tickets for my band's 9:30 Club gig ? 
So am I pretty much the only person who prefers Digimon to Pokemon ? 
Cataclysm's probably gonna kick ass 
When the prodigal son picks the skin off his teeth \ 
He licks the top of his lips , he says you are what you eat 
was planning to go to < PROPMALE > Potter tomorrow morning , only to discover that he has a dentist appointment at that time . FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU 
Dnd was friggin ' awesome . \ 
Going to have people fuck around with my teeth now , bye 
Finished writing a song with < PROPFIRST > and saw HP\ 
Needless to say it was pretty damn good 
Wow , Jhonen's finally working on a new comic . But he's gonna have someone else do the < PROPMALE > , and he himself is just writing it . \ 
I guess it should be great , but I really like his < PROPMALE > style , so it's unfortunate 
Raked leaves , wrote a terrible essay , going to band practice now 
We don't need our heads ' cause our bodies are young 
So the new MCR album seems kind of average . It's a shame considering the band is capable of doing so much better 
So apparently being transformed into an enormous cockroach isn't nearly as enjoyable as I thought it should be 
Oh yay I get to go to a pointless convocation day tomorrow 
Philosophy journal time 
Goddammit Dinkleberg 
needs to get some more Arcade Fire 
I slept in way too late 
WoW updates are fun 
[ insert generic \Happy Thanksgiving\ " status here ] " 
requires clarification on how this Friday is blacker than all the others 
Wow , writing and practicing originals with the band is actually going really well . I thought they would suck , but they're actually pretty good imo 
Well , no more 9:30 Club gig . Thanks to < PROPFIRST>'s dad . \ 
And thank you to anyone who was going to come see us anyways ( i.e. no one ) 
SOAD is finally going on tour again ... except it's in Europe . Wtf . 
Fagmuffin : pretty much the most adorable insult ever 
< PROPMALE > PRYOR AND < PROPFIRST > CONLEY ARE PLAYING AT THE OTTOBAR DEC 9 . YESSS 
likes turtles 
Practiced acoustic shit with < PROPFIRST > , playin ' D&D now :D 
And they call it a wasteland 
Boardwalk Empire is amazing\ 
Even though half the time it feels like I'm watching soft porn 
Well I made my profile picture a cartoon character\ 
Maybe it will make people stop beating children 
All alone in space and time\ 
There's nothing here but what's here's mine\ 
Something borrowed something blue\ 
Every me and every you 
Saves The Day is great\ 
Can't wait for the show on Thursday :D 
Writing a terrible essay . Maybe I'll go get Cataclysm later at least 
Well , my voice sounds a helluva lot better now 
RIP Lennon and Dimebag 
I'm refusing to update my profile 
< PROPFIRST > Conley , < PROPMALE > Pryor , < PROPFIRST > Raneri , and < PROPMALE > Kensrue were friggin ' awesome at Ottobar last night . Such a great show . I even got to talk to < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > a little bit afterwards and found out that < PROPMALE > Bemis is playing there Feb 18 . So yeah I'm definitely going to that 
Back from < PROPFEMALE > . Goin ' to the concert now I guess 
Undead pirates : the best kind of pirates 
Break can't come soon enough 
Shit I've gotta go get Razia's Shadow 
Tonight will be the night that we begin to ease the plugs out of the dam 
D&D was funnn . Goin ' to Hack n Slash tomorrow 
Hack & Slash show was fantastic 
Early Christmas gifts -- Relationship of Command , Expo 86 , < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim , and < PROPMALE > Wood\ 
It was a good day 
So apparently tonight's gonna be the darkest night in 500 years or so 
There's something in the way you people smell like you've got no soul at all 
has an amazing new amp :] 
Went and got myself Apologies to the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
Mall was pretty fun , except I missed meeting < PROPFIRST > fucking Gaskarth 
got JTHM , Saves The Day , Get Up Kids , Wolf Parade , Fable 3 , and a badass amp 
Goin ' to the Bahamas , brb 
I'll take you where nobody knows you and nobody gives a damn 
It'll take more than bad luck just to kill me 
Get Him to the Greek was actually pretty good 
Wow I really can't concentrate on studying right now\ 
I've pretty much just stopped trying 
You taught me how\ 
I play the fool\ 
And every mistake that I make\ 
I couldn't made without you\ 
What's said is done\ 
And plain to see\ 
You take it all too seriously\ 
So here's all you get from me 
D&D was great . Got band practice tomorrow along with a monster of an essay to write and exam shit to study . How will I do it all you might ask ? \ 
I WON'T . 
is pretty much falling in love with Arcade Fire 
Aside from a fun band practice I haven't actually done anything today and I'm kind of pissed off about it 
Okay so today I actually have to study and start the essay . /killself 
Death is gonna catch up to all one day , \ 
But yours is coming quicker than ours , in hours 
One exam down\ 
NOW WHERE THE HELL IS MY CHARACTER SHEET AJDRFTHGSDNXFSGHBT 
New profile layout isn't too bad actually 
I really hope this essay doesn't suck 
new Painful Splits album next month :D 
I discard all my feelings as the stars still scar my ceiling 
You are a runner and I am my father's son 
WTFNEWZODIACSIGN 
Smile for the camera , suck in that gut\ 
Don't shame your family , you'll have bad luck\ 
And the whole world is waiting to see when you fall 
So the Weakerthans are pretty awesome 
People need to stop bitching about bands they like selling out . Like half the time it doesn't even actually affect their style too drastically , and if it does it's usually just a new direction the band wanted to explore . God forbid they should broaden their fan base and make more money for doing something they love . Not every band on a < PROPMALE > label sucks because they're too mainstream for you . Jesus Christ 
Oh my god my essay wasn't even long enough I'm probably gonna fail or something 
Stuff I'm considering trying to buy this weekend :\ 
The Academy Is\ 
Mayday Parade\ 
Weezer\ 
Silversun Pickups\ 
Saves The Day\ 
Brand New\ 
The Arcade Fire\ 
Wolf Parade\ 
Any recommendations ? 
G'night

I almost forgot how much I love Nirvana 
hates the sport American Football right now , but is loving the band American Football quite a lot 
is trying to make a character for the new Pathfinder campaign module . Fuq yeah . 
The < PROPMALE>'s Speech was amazing\ 
Pretty much everyone should go see it now

There'd better be a delay tomorrow 
Texted-based horror adventure games and pizza . Hellzyes . 
new Get Up Kids album next weekkk 
So apparently < PROPFEMALE > Baron Cohen is playing < PROPFIRST > Mercury in an upcoming movie about his life 
OH HI < PROPFIRST > 
Back from a semi-productive band practice 
G'night all 
There's nothing to do today really except homework and we all know I'm not gonna do that 
TUESDAY'S COMING , DID YOU BRING YOUR COAT 
I should probably sleep more 
There's no time for homework , this song needs to get written goddammit 
has just remembered that the new Get Up Kids album came out today 
I can't believe there was actually snow today . \ 
We'd better get more tonight too , I'm not ready for like 3 tests/quizzes in the same day 
Snowpocalypse 2.0 , here we come 
Time to go shovel again I guess 
D&D was fun\ 
Probably gonna go see Social Network tomorrow finally 
The Social Network was actually really good 
I like to picture Jesus as a figure skater . He wears like a white outfit , and He does interpretive ice dances of my life's journey . 
Fable 3 is better than I thought it would be 
wow Gattaca was pretty awesome 
People should suggest some horror punk bands to me 
Everyone should go listen to Right Away , Great Captain 
\We're fucking < PROPFEMALE > . We can do whatever the hell we want . \"- < PROPFIRST > Bowers " 
I HATE ALL OF YOU FOR HAVING NO SCHOOL . 
My dust will be your salt\ 
My blood will hydrate you all\ 
My heart will be your meal\ 
And I won't ride the cycle of the way it kills to think and feel 
Y'know what ? After listening to Danger Days more I've realized it's actually a pretty damn good album 
I miss the comfort in being sad 
doesn't know how to do math 
learnin ' a buncha Nirvana covers 
I just completely forgot I have a math essay due tomorrow ( which I still think is a really stupid assignment for a math class , honestly ) 
Yo Gabba Gabba is quite possibly the greatest show of all time . 
People should suggest some punk blues bands to me 
Red was actually quite good 
Nirvana Unplugged is amazing 
Black Eyed Peas with Slash ? Wtf 
is on a death metal binge . Suggests bands . NOW 
Anyone who loves Say Anything as much as I do needs to go listen to Menorah/Majora like right now if you haven't yet 
Your < PROPMALE > , it brought me to my knees 
My daddy taught me good 
holy shit White Stripes split up 
If I could take the fire out from the wire I'd share a life and you'd share a life 
Light up a new joint\ 
Put on an old shirt\ 
Try to remember\ 
Forget how my brain works 
Oh my god Mean Everything To Nothing is such an epic album 
Frech powerpoint , Manchester Orchestra , and cornbread 
Keep using love as the excuse to why we're fat and lazy\ 
Wait to grow old like we've been told go bald , go west and crazy\ 
This is so pointless it actually holds up our evolution\ 
Sing it to the bastards , free yourself from mental prostitution 
Got my guitar fixed finally and got some Subway , Fuqyeah 
Why haven't I bought the new Get Up Kids album yet 
is playing way too much Fable 2 
SNL is actually hilarious tonight 
I am but a clean man , stable and alone man\ 
Make it so I won't have to try\ 
The faces always stay the same\ 
So I'll face the fact that I'm just fine\ 
I said that I'm just fine 
< PROPFEMALE > and the Machine is actually pretty awesome 
I still can't believe Arcade Fire won Album of the Year . I think it's awesome that they did but I really wasn't expecting it 
\The young always have the same problem - how to rebel and conform at the same time . They have now solved this by defying their parents and copying one another . \"" 
River City Extension is really amazing , listen to them dammit 
The < PROPFEMALE > hangs like the blade of an axe tonight 
Why can't there be a music history class goddammit 
4 day weekend :D 
So today ended up being really awesome 
< PROPMALE > Bemis tonight :D 
got a River City Extension CD and had it signed by the band , got the new Painful Splits album , got < PROPMALE>'s water bottle , and met < PROPMALE > Turner . On top of all that , it was just an incredible show . ' Twas a wonderful night indeed 
Well . That was probably the first time I've ever heard the word braggadocious used in a song 
Oh my gawd why I am I even up right now 
Yesterday was amazing\ 
I never realized how much fun it is to just look at random books in Barnes & < PROPMALE > 
Happy birthday < PROPMALE > 
finally finished Fable 2\ 
It had a really cool ending actually 
There'd better be snow tonight . I really need more time for this hw 
I really didn't expect to get the day off so I'm really happy now\ 
Time to start Fable 3 >:D

FOOL OF A TOOK 
< PROPMALE > Waits is pretty great 
GSA conference was super fun 
is loving the National right now 
Why the hell do people dislike the second half of Fable 3 
I should've started using Pandora constantly a long time ago 
Sometimes I wonder where I'd be if all my friends abandonned me\ 
On a vessel out to sea , took every lifeboat and they ran\ 
It's funny how we'd switch our roles , empty cabins , empty hulls\ 
And all the food filled up with mold , I'd stand on deck without a hand\ 
Feeling so much bigger than I am 
There'll be no more dinner bells left for you to ring 
I think the finish line's a good place we could start 
new Get Up Kids album is actually pretty awesome 
Growing old never takes its toll until you're losing track of all the things you won't ever have back again 
It's amazing how a day can turn to complete and utter shit in less than five minutes and then suddenly get so much better just five hours later 
finally got some Dragon Age Origins and Oblivion expansions\ 
All set for spring break >:D 
just got a sexy new electric-acoustic and it sounds great :D 
9 was actually pretty damn good 
Can spring break please just not ever end 
I forgot how awesome the Pixies were 
Well . Going back to school actually hasn't been too horrible yet

This is already shaping up to be the longest four day week ever 
I've grown accustomed to the grays and blacks because they're always coming back
