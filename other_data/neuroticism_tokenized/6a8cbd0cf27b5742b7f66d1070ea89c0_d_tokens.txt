Wish there was a cure for migraines 
Thankful for friends and family . Trying to remember to tell them each day how much they mean to me . 
Worried about meeting tomorrow . Guess I will find out what I am doing wrong now . I hate when meeting is scheduled to discuss something and you feel like you are walking into it blind . 
Enjoyed the snow today . The large flakes reminded me of spring snow storms when I was a kid in Colorado . But I am ready for warmer weather now .

President Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011 . This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973 ! Nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation , while war is fought in 2 theatres , our men and women in uniform get A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS !!! Please repost if you support our troops 
Looking forward to a new week , I am sure it will be busy but I am going to try some of the tips that I have been learning for stress reduction and it is should be a great week no matter what . 
It was a good start to the week . Thankful for the beautiful day , family and friends 
Working on looking at thing from a new perspective . Taking small steps to change negative thoughts into postive ones . I remember a t-shirt that was popular when I was I kid , I ain't junk , cause God don't make junk . I am going to remind myself of that each time the negative thoughts come into my head . 
Starting another week . Thank God for the opportunity to learn and grow .
