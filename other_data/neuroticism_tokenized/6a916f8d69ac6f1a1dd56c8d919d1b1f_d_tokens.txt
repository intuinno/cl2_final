I'm totally geeking out ! I'm running Windows Vista 64 bit and I'm making it so I can click an icon in my start menu for an old dos game and the computer will automatically mount the . iso for the cd for the game , run dosbox , navigate to the directory for the game and load it , then when I close the game it closes dosbox and unmounts the cd image and returns to my desktop XDDD 
\I crap in your general direction \"" 
This is so lame - I hate getting sucked into impersonal superficial things - I spend hours doing something that seems fun and interesting but just turns out being a waste of time . I miss radio and books and musical instruments . I miss learning and breathing in things that are real .

I think the real reason they tell you not to eat anything , even on the other side of your mouth , within an hour after getting fillings is so you don't bite the shit out of your lips and start bleeding everywhere without realizing it .... I R Winner . 
/scream 
So I reformatted my laptop with Vista because I broke down and decided I like things being automatic(ish ) . Now , however , I'm starting to get really tired of the harddrive constantly running and I want to get a solid state disk drive and an extra gig of ram - maybe next christmas :)

I need to shave hella bad 
so I'm trying to climb up into the bed all twisted on the wrong side of the RV without the ladder because I want to grab the blanket for a movie and I HAVE to check the roof for a leak and I pull a captain awesome and step blindly off and slip on a cushion and fall back against a computer case = win

If you and I awoke in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Only using 4 words what would you say to me . Note : copy and paste so I can comment back be a good sport :)

Getting face drilled at the dentist : 
My castles always burn 
Off to work 
I hate how cars are always sucking money . I don't mind fixing stuff and getting things working , especially if it's for my baby (^.^) , but it gets expensive 
I MISS MISSOULA !!!! 
I hate it how I can have an entire song just grown in my head but I can't ever figure out how to manage my time so I can sit down and learn how to make it on the computer >:( 
I have all this stuff I should prolly do today and I don't want to do freaking any of it >:( 
I would rather be doing just about anything than writing this stupid paper right now . I loath English classes . 
Why now , is my mind so violently rending and opening to < PROPMALE > ? Why now ? The inconvenience is typical of life , so I suppose it's not entirely abnormal ... * sigh * ... :( 
it's weird - the more I see - the less I associate \mankind\ " with white-skinned people . "

Husband and Wife Week ? If your spouse is your best friend , works hard for and with you , who has been with you through thick and thin , who loves you when you're at your worst , and whom you are PROUD to be married to , copy and paste this with the year you were married -2010 ( been together since 2009 ) 
Unleashing some Force Unleashed 
Got the oil changed in the diesel and now off to town to put some biodiesel in it :D 
So the rear hatch latch on the diesel rusted shut because the rear window seal has been leaking water bad - the funny thing is , after penetrating oil and a pair of plyers to get it undone - lithium grease did nothing to fix it . I could open and shut it , but not like it should - the thing that fixed it ? GOOD OLD FASHIONED MOTOR OIL , dispensed from an old school pump can . Guess sometimes the old ways are best ... :) 
I want a miniature giraffe to kick people's asses for me :D 
So ... It's looking like I'm going to have to get rid of the diesel rabbit ... :( 
why the hell is the floor in front of the urinal at the college all sticky ? 
In 7 days , I'm turning 00100100

every generation needs something to be afraid of ... 
Just used the web installer for Ubuntu 11.04 to install Ubuntu onto my laptop , then used Synaptic Package Manager to install the Ubuntu Studio packages for recording software and desktop themes , then reverted from Ubuntu Studio's Gnome desktop to the new Unity desktop , keeping the Ubuntu Studio themes in place then used a apt-get install line in terminal to install the wireless drivers ! I'm having a geek-gasm XD 
lol I just imagined how awesome it'd be to have a crotch rocket with a radial engine mounted transversely ( with cylinders pointing forwards and back , crankshaft going left to right ) , running on diesel fuel . it would be so freaking loud but awesome XD
