-- 3/3 MultiCare applications rejected ! They're smart . I didn't even have time to call them yet . 
rearranged Zach's drumset to include both our collective cymbals . I believe it's a 5pc set with 12 cymbals . I could make it a 7pc eventually , but I think this is fine enough for the space we have . Not even MultiCare is going to spoil my mood to pound on it tomorrow . SO excited !

may try to get some exercise if I cannot get a hold of Nels . 
-- Nels , no . Exercise , yes . All of it . Time for cold shower . Either Forza 3 time or crash . I am being happily consumed by misanthropy . 
is devouring Pop Tarts , texting the Polish beauty , and bumping the hell out of Kadence Rain and sikTh . It's a good night . 
thinks something has < PROPFEMALE > bummed . Makes me sad . And nervous . 
has just lost about 3 hours of my life to live Incubus videos . Whoa . What happened ?! That was incredible . 
is excited to jam tomorrow ! Did not actually sleep last night , so I'm packing it in early . Window open . Phone off . Fan on . Kenin out . 
is researching medical billing classes . Inpatient and outpatient . Tired of this shit . 
saw a random SOAP ( subjective/objective/assessment/plan ) note online . Noticed at least 4 errors in it . This document was posted by a medical institution of Portugal , oddly enough . At least I know I still got it . 
got a new shirt from < PROPFEMALE > . It is classy as hell . I cannot WAIT !

has riffer's block . Phone will be off tonight . KENIN CRASH . 
-- My money is now officially in the negative . Never ends . Time for bed , I guess . 
-- Today was much better . Good friends . Severe damage with maximum jammage . Mixed the pretties with the chuggies , and it was wonderful . Had some mediocre Eggo's that were soggy as hell and tasted like a warm blueberry sock . May be able to rectify band situation . Off to get drinks w/Cathy . We're so embarrassing . 
wrote out some riffs . Time to wind down and crash hard . I only slept about 90 minutes last night . Pinched a nerve today as well . Oof .

wants to jam , dammit ! 
is mildly sad that I never did get to make my computer death metal project . It was to be called CTRL + ALT + DECAPITATE . The music would be technical in nature , and the only feeling would be frustration . There would be lots of mistakes and crashes while we bitch about the insecurity of Windows . Now we have windows Vista . Which should warrant at least an entire album of material in itself . 
is feeling lethargic today . I must have been overworked from my lack of employment . Need to pay cell < PROPMALE > and pick up key for the election booth for Friday . Get to actually work Fri and Sat , then have tent time with my satanic , Polish cupcake . 
paid cell < PROPMALE > . Got key from elections office . Dropped by Guitar Center , and nobody cool was there . Not very good display amps either .

-- Is now infiltrating government and state careers . May my applications and cover letters spread through Washington State job banks like herpes .

-- IIIIIIIII AAAAAAAAAAM STRAIGHT EDGE ! ( It's an Earth Crisis kind of day . ) 
does not feel any cooler getting up at 5am . Ego- or temperature-wise . 
roasted in the election booth today . They called me to pick up an additional shift on Monday afternoon in Puyallup ! Will probably be just as hot then . Yick . Oh well . An easy $60 . Soooo lethargic . I just want ice and sleep . And food would be nice .

thought the election center would be open later than 4.30 p . Foiled again . 
read < PROPFIRST > Kardashian wanted to date a nice boy instead of a player . Like , OMG . With her money , I'd never have to work again . 
just had an evening with Nels . Got curry and watched A Haunting In Connecticut . ... pretty freaky , for sure . 
just sent an email to All Creatures Animal Hospital in Belfair . They mentioned something about a medical records conversion . I am all about it . Doubtful they are hiring specifically for that ; I did not see it on their job listing . Couldn't hurt , I guess . 
is pondering how to make Katatonia's \Omerta\ " disgustingly heavy . " 
thinks FB chat is the most ridiculously unreliable thing I've experienced on the web . Kadence came up with a name for our project : Synergy . To the very few people who know it -- Yes , just like the Extol album . Wonderful !

is cocooning himself from music elitism .

Giggity .

-- Portnoy left Dream Theater . Ironic , since yesterday was my Dream Theater day . Sad . =( 
just wanted a different status . 
may join forces to help a few people with different NPO ideas . One is for kitties , one is for Arts ! Time to embrace my inner hippie . Came at a perfect time , as I am almost out of my AXE deodorant . Now to buy a Phish CD ... 
is doing a music experiment . I need multiple people to post a comment , giving me three random < PROPFIRST > between the values 2 and 31 . When I get about 15 or 20 people to post , I'll call it good for now . =) Thank you in advance ! 
-- Thank you for your input ; I'm done collecting < PROPFIRST > for this experiment ! 
-- I'm usually such a sarcastic prick , but just give thought to all those people involved in 9/11 . Well . The innocent dead ones . ( Shit , I almost made it . ) 
-- And yeah ... I have enough < PROPFIRST > for my musical experiment . Thank you ! Even though a good 5 people came forward after I was good the first time . Haha . 15 people , 45 < PROPFIRST > . Yikes ! 
is lucky to have a great lady . =) 
has interview 9.30 a tomorrow for an Unemployment Insurance Specialist job at WorkSource Thurston County . Hopefully I can get a job and become responsible , so I can blow all kinds of money on an STi , guitars , drums , Axe-FX Ultra , donuts , El Toro , Dr. Pepper , Pop Rocks , Bubble Tape , cheesy bread , milkshakes ... and a dirt bike . Perhaps a residence of my own someday . HHAH . 
has started the time signature experiment . Part 1 is done . Sometimes all you need is a spark to ignite the entire thing into wildfire . =D Time to crash .

sees I have missed nothing on here . Probably going on another field trip to K's . 
just had my UI claim reopened . My new application extension packet should be here tomorrow . Just filed for last week , so I'm on this train again . If they accept my extension , I'll at least have a little bit to go on , but it takes them at least a few weeks to decide . 25% Nervous , 25% Relieved , 50% Frustrated . 
is studying ECG arrhythmia examples . 
bombarded MultiCare with 4 applications . Hell with it . 
may have an additional opportunity for Pierce County during the elections . 
cannot stop thinking of the sonic possibilities of the Agile Intrepid 928 MN Nat 9-string guitar . That ... would change everything . 
is consuming soft , homemade peanut butter cookies . Life has certainly been worse than this . =) Mmmm . 
-- Ahhh ... a monumental curry feast was had with < PROPMALE > . Might be time to make some drum beats ... 
had a stellar jam with Kadence . Hauntingly brilliant ideas afoot .

is tabbing dysphoria ... tabbing dysphoria ... tabbing ... dysphoria . 
has been having strange dreams . I fell in hardcore love with a lesbian , sat in a wheelchair to attend a Nazi banquet , and some dude cracked a joke about tater-tots to offend the Nazi's and got choked out . Somehow , the joke was HILARIOUS , and I tried with every fiber of my being to not crack the hell up . I then wheeled out of the banquet , in my wheelchair . 
is off to Pao's with Sinnamon . 
-- Did I hear someone say ... DOPPELGANGER WEEK ?! =D YEEEEAAAAHH ! 
is starting to favor dreams to reality . 
-- Oh , alright . Jesus . Like\ 
my status & I'll tell you : \ 
-- Something I've learned about you by \ 
looking at your wall for 13 seconds . \ 
-- The color you remind me of . \ 
-- My\ 
first memory of you . \ 
-- The animal you remind me of . \ 
-- Ask something \ 
I've always wondered about you . \ 
-- My favorite thing about you . \ 
-- Give you a weird nickname . 
had to post something else because the other status just looks hideous . 
believes he has a cold . Not too bad during the day , but start to feel worse at night . At least I have nothing immediately going on . I can pump Vitamin C and get some serious sleepage . 
just wants to be floating on a 40° waterbed with no covers , in a very dark room ; listening to Kadence minimally harmonizing vocals over heavy drone , surrounded by fluffy , purring cats ... that do not drool . Jeeeeaaaahhhh ... 
got PAID . Hellooooo < PROPMALE > P42 ! May pick it up and restring it tomorrow . If I ignore everyone for months , don't be offended . My < PROPMALE > is my #1 .

-- got a lovely Halloween treat from < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 ( That sounds mischievous , but not anything you would think . ) Off to work shortly . ... that's probably the only time you'll see me use that heart ... 
thinks there is no such thing as an \unexpected error\ " in Facebook Chat . I actually almost rely on them to be about every 2 posts . "

... what the hell ?! The ground is shaking ... Kadence must be riffing the 8-string again ! 
-- Pizza for the birthday girl , and hopefully < PROPFEMALE > and I get our movie marathon ! 
-- Tonight is ALL about doom and sludge . Pummel the air from my lungs and leave me here to die . Or at least ... bitch about everything . Yeeeeaaaahhhh ! =D 
had a nice jam with Z . I have a bad feeling somehow ... not digging it . 
blaaaaaahhh . 
is hoping a little old-school VOD picks the day up . 
There's no place like drone . 
made beauty drone . Recorder messed up so many times mixing down . Giving up for the night . 
-- the drone is converted ! 
closer to the lung ; shove her over railing . 
is suddenly depressed to find that Haagen-Dazs has discontinued their Sticky Toffee Pudding ice cream some time ago . I was just hoping everyone was conveniently out of stock . =( I no longer fear Hell . 
is trying to network laptop and pc . This will probably end in fail . I've connected some kind of cable between the two . You can tell I didn't < PROPMALE > in Networking . I < PROPMALE > ed in programming . I remember cin , cout , Option Explicit , and Dim Kenin as Pissed . 
-- I AM THE SMARTEST MAN ALIVE ! ( figured out the networking ! ) 
got some nice drum goodies from Nickman ! =D 
-- been up for an hour , and I'm already wanting to go back to bed . 
bored , yet entertained watching old UFC fights and women's soccer . Need to go on a raid for some cookies ! =D 
-- When it comes to some things , I don't have a Christian's < PROPMALE > at a Watain concert . 
-- Yesterday sucked total ASS . Today is marginally better . Cashed the last of my paychecks . Went to T with C . Get to practice my sneer while filling out extensive job apps for the state . Might be time for drone . 
got to pet BIG kitties ! =D ! 
learns you can never have everything you truly want . 
-- Supposed to be 16º Tuesday night . I'm pumped ! 
is back in T-T own . 
misses the 8 string , although I want fresh strings on it before I play again . Perhaps I'll get myself a little Christmas present then . =D 
-- Ah . Suppose it's officially Turkey Day . So yes . Have a good one of those ! 
-- Thanksgiving was delicious . Watched Scent of a Woman with the fam and cracked up . By the end of the day , I only had to see dessert misspelled twice . 
-- Time for a quick jam before the family festivities commence . Haven't played drums in quite awhile . Jeeeeaaaah . 
is loving these new Vic Firth Kinetic Force 5a sticks ! Happy camper , right here . 
had a good day . Jammed with Z ; Kenin was in rare form ! =D < PROPMALE > with all kinds of family . Video was recorded of an instrumental I made for dysphoria ; we'll see how that comes along ! < PROPMALE > with Nickman ; got MSM and watched lots of metal drummings on YouTube . What a night . 
-- you force me to watch you pull the stars from her eyes . 
wants cake . 
-- This Saturday , 6.20 p , tune in to 96.9 The Sound for 3 songs and an interview w/Kadence Rain ! This is huge for her , so spread the word like the plague and show some support ! 
gets to go to Bellevue for some temp eval/interview . Dolla dolla < PROPMALE > , y'all$! 
-- Probably going to reschedule my testing in Bellevue . I've my alarm set for 7.15 a , and I've not slept a damn minute . Exhausted , but cannot fall asleep . Pisses me off . 
-- Who the f*ck is < PROPFIRST > Bieber , and why should I care ?! 
-- YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHAAAAAAWWWWW ! \ 
Tacoma Acoustic is now for sale . Fresh-ass strings slapped on , and right to your FACE for $400 . \ 
http://www.rondomusic.com/intrepid930nat.html 
-- Had a curry breakfast (!) , but the rest of the day was just shitty . Never done a drug in my life , yet I spaced about listening to Kadence's huge radio debut . Friends who have heard me talk of her know I'm crazy about that girl and her music . I should have set my phone alarm while I had it fresh in my mind . Tomorrow's another day , I suppose . 
snagged Nels . Went to Pho < PROPFEMALE > and bitched about the world . Back home . Ready for bed , I guess . 
-- I figured this cartoon character was appropriate . Dr. Claw : a computer-savvy hermit who is equal parts stubborn and angry ; an elitist who loves cats and hates people ; one who is set out to destroy people who are tools , and is prone to failure . 
is getting over the last of the cold symptoms . I could taste my breakfast today , and I didn't quite sound like Darth Vader when I woke up . 
is \hungry enough to chew the crotch out of a rag doll . \ " Name that movie . " 
thinks the \new\ " profile should show my goddamn status at the top ! Not sure why they're tweaking profile layouts when they still have tons of problems with their chat application . " 
was looking up digital camcorders . I feel like a 12-year-old girl trying to go through laptop specs . Perhaps I'll just shor t-t erm trade or borrow from a friend or something . Yikes . 
tried for more sleep , but it's just not going to happen . Hell with it . =p 
-- Goddammit , Armin < PROPFIRST > Buuren . You hath farkled with my favorite Conjure One song and made it all trance-ish . I feel like I have glowsticks flying out my ass . =| 
has just figured out that my < PROPMALE > + fresh strings = Cynic . Now , if I can just get good enough to play songs from said band ... =D 
-- Nothing readies you for a day quite like blasting Rage Against the Machine in the shower . 
Hmmm . If we have any Cocoa Puffs , I am just SOLD . 
-- Listened to Origin in the shower . I think ... I blacked out . 
presents : The Kenin Concerto . Miscarriage Mastication , in G Minor . 
-- no faults on her , no imperfection ... 
just riffed out to Like Ice by Conjure One . With the 8-string . Yeeeeaaaahhhh . =D

is content , for the most part . 
is ROCKING Jojo Mayer's Nerve . Maaan . This is the best drum and bass I've heard , and using real instruments . 
-- Jeah . =) 
finished epic hybrid bowl of Cocoa Flakes/Frosted Puffs . Today's going to rock . 
floats today . 
wishes everyone a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas time . May all your dreams come true , and may everyone's anus get farkled . 
-- For Abra , a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas tiem . 
misses like hell having a functional band . And a job . 
-- i remember when i could get you to smile without stepping on your throat . 
-- It seems that Facebook is against my status saying that I just purchased a PreSonus Audiobox USB Recording Interface for my Christmas present . Hell . Jeah . =D 
hopes the weather will behave long enough so that I can drive to the lady's place tomorrow ! 
also thinks it's time for some GODDAMN DOOOOOOOM !!! 
-- Time to get pummeled to sleep by The Divinity of Oceans . See you next week , and have a Happy New Year ! 
is back in town , and needs a parachute . =D 
is hoping this year will blow the pants off 2k10 . Doing a good job already . Cannot wait for my interface to arrive ! =D 
-- PreSonus status : Hodgkins , IL , 01/04/2011 8:38 A.M. Departure . 
is rocking Cloudkicker . God bless < PROPMALE > , who writes this beautiful , groove-laden soundscape . 
-- How ironic would it be that I banish Kelsey ... then my hair starts to come back ? It's going to be a good year . 
-- goddamn letter of interest . 
-- PreSonus status : Fife , WA , 01/07/2011 4:45 A.M. Out For Delivery Today . Yeeeeaaaahhhh ! That was the boost I needed to get my farking job searches done . 
is rocking Flyleaf with a smile . Somewhat counteracts the paralytic , 12-hour dissociation of Ahab last night . Mmmm ... 
is slowly getting used to working with Studio One . I am such a perfectionist , I spent over an hour doing one song and ended up with nothing . Recording freaks me out . Thankfully , I can just click delete and everything goes away ! =D Surely I will get more solid as I get accustomed to it . 
woke up to my lazy paycheck , new guitar strings , renewed pharmacy assistant license , and homemade molasses cookies ! Today can't be all that bad . 
-- Job searches are done . Blaaah . Time for bed , I guess . Excited for the weekend ! 
had a wonderful birthday weekend full of love , sloth , gluttony , sin , and cougar petting ... of the feline persuasion . 
blaaaaaaaaaahhhhh . 
is hoping against hope that I get Round Table Pizza AND a good jam today . ( crosses fingers ) 
is somewhat finished restringing the 2228 . The . 012 snapped during stretching . Nothing really pisses me off more , but at least it's an easy find for a single string . Had to modify the bridge to compensate for the . 080 properly , but it should be fine . 
finished restringing the Ibanez RG2228 and the EBMM JP-7 . My audio is now full of sparkles and brown notes . 
is content , but hungry like crazy ! 
\Is there a little bird eating all my faxes ? \ " =D " 
is looooooved . =) 
thinks it's a Bongzilla kind of day . Yeeeeaaaah ! 
is looking forward to jamming . I could beat the Christ out of some drums right now . 
is slowly falling in love with < PROPFEMALE>'s Bengal kittens . Brought home my < PROPFEMALE > Demon Drive pedals to begin the tweaking ! Been a lot of changes ; not sure if they're good changes yet . 
just used the word \baller\ " in a sentence like it was nothing . " 
had a wonderful weekend , and is ready to take on the week . Giggity . 
is puzzled that I can suddenly fly through Swiss triplets on my < PROPFEMALE > Demon Drives . I used to be able to fly through alternating heel-toe doubles . I believe one pedal is tensioned lighter than the other . Something strange is afoot ( pun intended) ! 
is off to help < PROPMALE > get an old Suby ! The Grill may ensue . Mmmm ... 
has an interview tomorrow in Tukwila . They want to interview me for an entry-level management position and/or personal assistant . LOL Kenin , Corporate Emperor of Doom . 
hates shaving my face . I look like a chunky , balding , 12-year-old chipmunk . I cannot rise to power looking like this ! 
is constantly in awe of how great of an angel I have . 
has a new phone ! They got rid of my old ringtones I downloaded years ago , dammit . Anyway , being able to have a kitten as my background makes up for it . =D 
-- Room is a disaster . Hell with it . Debating whether sleep will even be worth it if I need to be up at 5am . 
made it through my booth shift . Now it is room-cleaning tiem . ( For you , Abra ) 
had a wonderful weekend . Digging the hell out of s/t Project 86 . Man . I also have a skills assessment with Regence on Tuesday . Woot . 
also feels strange checking my Facebook after seeing The Social Network . 
has been seeing an ungodly amount of sexy Suby STi's lately . 
-- I suppose I could have wished everyone a happy V-Day , but I don't imagine most of my friends even really care . So yes , happy belated V-Day if you do . =) 
had a typing assessment for Regence . Needed 30 wpm and/or 8500 kph ( 10-key ) . Got 8828 kph and 74 wpm , both with no errors . ( Honestly , you shouldn't have any if you can use backspace ! ) Landed interview 1pm Thursday . Hopefully good things result . Off to spoil the lady soon for her birthday tomorrow ! 
is happy and loved . 
-- Paranormal Activity . Not the best movie to watch an hour or so before you would like to sleep . 
reading up on Asian Leopard Cats , hoping to hear from Regence , and watching videos of Lambos drift . Lovely night in . 
-- Life certainly has been good the past few months . However ... I miss SikTh . I miss jamming and creating . I miss paychecks . I miss the time when my sugar cereals tasted like something other than cardboard because they were NOT whole grain . I miss having my Bengal . I miss my DigiTech distortion . I miss soccer . 
had a wonderful weekend . I am only researching , but I am wondering where the H someone actually acquires an Asian Leopard Cat ?! Certainly not ready yet ; just curious . 
-- Regence rejected me . Yesss ! =D Apparently typing 74 wpm when only 30 wpm was required still wasn't good enough . Not a huge mystery how I've not had full-time employment since 2007 . Fuck it . Let's see how much longer I can go ! 
-- Oh my God . One of the most profanely hilarious things I have heard , spoken about Milla Jovovich : \I'd drag my < PROPMALE > through a mile of broken glass just to smell where ? she pissed last night . \"" 
smells nice with his new spicy deodorant . 
-- Forza Motorsport 4 is coming out 9.1.11 ! Yesssssss !!! SO pumped . 
-- Miss Abra Cadaver just got inducted into my personal Hall of Fame with this charming excerpt . \TAMPONS : SATAN'S LITTLE COTTON FINGERS . \"" 
I'm thinking I may look into a good music theory book , even though I do not want to . Always hated theory , but it supposedly looks good if you are going to give guitar lessons and the like . I find it more impressive that I graduated from Meshuggah University , thank you very much . =D 
\You're not good enough to host AIDS . \"" 
I kind of want cheesy bread and milkshakes . 
Now I want Round Table Pizza . Or perhaps I can try making that Thai Kitchen panang curry base that I picked up . I wish I had a venti caramel frappuccino with an inch of standing caramel at the bottom of it . ( bites lip ) Mmmmm ... 
THIS is why I do not get up early . I simply turn into a monster and think of all the things that I want to eat ; half of them will not even be open for another 5 damn hours . Ugh . Early is so overrated . 
Right now , I want to hear Goatwhore and Tech N9ne partner up to cover \Pocketful of Sunshine\ " by < PROPFEMALE > Bedingfield . " 
Strikeforce was picked up by Zuffa ( UFC ) , and people are nervous about the future of women's MMA . Bring back < PROPFEMALE > Carano and Cristiane < PROPFIRST > ! Those ladies sell . Women's MMA is too shallow ( not enough fighters ) as it stands . I think < PROPFIRST > White should set up a program to encourage more female fighters and secure the future of the sport for them . 
Lovely weekend ; still recuperating today . Get to clean house a little , free up some space on the DVR , have leftover curry feast with < PROPFEMALE > for her homecoming (!) , complete the last leg of 3play training , research some job links . Woot . 
Just received a signed copy of Gianluca Ferro's Unheimlich album ! =D This made my week . Thank you , Gian ! HUGE hugs ! 
Total Amount Due : $465.00 . Fuck you , Regence . Fuck you . 
I wonder if < PROPFIRST > could spare some of his Tiger Blood , because I could use some right about now . 
Been an excruciating and trying week , but the weekend is finally heah . Right ... heah ! 
sshhhhh ... Lissa sleeping . 
Fuck it . Raised the bar . Applied for State job : $ 40,524 . 00 - $ 53,148 . 00 Annually . 
Did job items . Taking advantage of a surprise jam offer con La Kadencia . Adios ! 
Wonderful time in < PROPFEMALE > . Got my 80s preamp back ! Lovely rainy drive . Back home . Quite sleepy . 
Why am I so hungry lately ?! I finished off a LARGE Domino's BBQ pizza with a lava cake last night at Kadence's place . I had some leftover teriyaki in the fridge tonight , and I just want MORE . Of everything ! I had better not be pregnant ... =p 
Posted ALL of my 30-Day Challenge . Not one goddamn comment . Fine . You're getting it now . 
I be hella balla < PROPFEMALE > com , yo . 
I saw Black Swan with the lady just this past weekend . It was a trip . Not quite sure what else to say . Oh , yes I do ! OM NOM NOM NOM . 
It was a good day . 
Measure . Calculate . Shake . Aim . Spray . Wait . Place . Press . Repeat . Sealing up guitar cab with anti-sound foam . Should make things tighter and such . 
Damn you , 3Play Media . One of the first files I have seen available for days , and it is just under an hour long , shitty audio quality , heavy accents , and a TAT of 14 hours . =\\ Fail . 
For procrastinators , Facebook is a wet dream . I need to step away so I can regain control of things and quit peppering away valuable time . Most who actually contact me already have my cell number , which is also in my Info . For email , please use paintyourstorm at netscape < PROPFEMALE > net , NOT the one listed . Do svidaniya .
