Is bored 

Finishing up summer work ... what fun . 
I miss orchestra . I miss being in a band . I miss my friends from school . I hate summer work . Why can't summer be what it used to be ? Least I have Malorie =] . Anyone else feel like this ?

also got the new Avenged Sevenfold cd !!! =] 
So I got my ears pierced , finally , lol . 
So the other day , I was shaving what few hairs I have on my face , and I realized , with growing horror , that I was using Gilette , a product endorsed by Tiger Woods . Then I realized I didn't care . 
Ap Euro Enlightenment salon tommorrow ... should be fun . I'm Voltaire , lol 
loves the idea of giving food to the poor , but HATES that it's preventing him from doing anything 
It's a good thing I like politics , because if < PROPFEMALE > hadn't introduced me to them , AP Gov . would go by very slowly ... 
Is officially tally bound ! 
Is in the 850 ! 
Is super cute and playing Assassin's Creed like a boss ! :) 
I love AP Gov :) but I hate the work that comes with it . Still ... it is fun to get Mrs. McGalliard all keyed up 
Life is pretty good , I have to say :-) I'm feeling great 
is not a fan of people being fans of other normal ... that is , excluding < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , Master of Matter 
doesn't understand why AP teachers can't give us a break . 
Does anyone know the format for the ap euro outlines ? Or the ap gov slideshow ? 
To my political friends : you should check out what < PROPMALE > Coburn said about < PROPFEMALE > Pelosi , Fox News . and the health care < PROPMALE > . You will be shocked .

If I ran a daycare , I would name it Obamacare . I'm not against Obama , i just would like to see people's reaction to it 
< PROPFEMALE > Palin = LOL

I don't understand how fans of < PROPFIRST > Beck can call President Obama a fascist , then allow a fear monger to think for them . Isn't that fascism ?

Post this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Gator fan . Being a Gator fan is a real disorder and is no laughing matter ; this should be taken very seriously . There is still no cure , and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness . 90% of Gator fans won't repost this because they don't know how to copy and paste .

I am a pro . I snapped my thumb backwards while trying to catch a pop fly with the wrong hand ... now I have to walk around with a brace on my hand . 
So my thumb is most likely sprained , or at worst , a hairline fracture . Either way , I'm treating it the best I can . In other news , it's em effing chili day !!! 
I'm so tired of the tea party ...
