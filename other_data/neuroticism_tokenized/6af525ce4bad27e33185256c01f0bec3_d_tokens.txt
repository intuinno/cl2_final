is going CrAzY !..... who wants to come ? ... my treat ! 
Never underestimate the power of a woman . Piss her off and she will take her revenge when you least expect it . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
don't you wish life is like a remote some girls have mute buttons boys have edit buttons bad times had fast forward buttons and good times had pause buttons ??? 
If u are afraid of what Ur friends will say about you being a Christian , what r u gonna do when the day comes when Ur life depends on u standing for Christ ? 
Believes that when two people r true friends that when something is bothering the other they should be able to talk about it rather it be good or bad ! 
Half the things we worry about in life never really happen anyways . 
If you are not as close to God as you used to be , who moved ? 
thinks you only get to live once , so you should smile a lot , laugh more , keep memories close , but don't get caught in the past , love life , and live it full ! 
you got to live and learn crash and burn make some stances and take some chances you got to laugh and love and take all life has to give 
why does it take a minute to have a crush on someone , an hour to like someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone . 
Dear Lord today i ask you to touch my friends and family and help them to know that you love them and died for them i Ask it all in your name AMEN ! 
Who needs a psychologist when you have God ? just pray , It's free ! 
When you allow things to bother you , you are giving it power over you . Just march forward and do what you must . Remove the emotions and you'll find it easier . 
All I ask is that you accept me for who I am -- not who you want me to be . 
the one thing you can give for free and 99% of the time you will get right back is a smile

GOOD NITE FB FAMLY 
GOOD NIGHT FB FAMILY LETS ALL PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER AND ALL BE BLESSED 
FB family I'm tired just finished doing SUNDAY dinner , my menu , fresh turnip&mustards e resh field peas and okra on top , < PROPMALE > roast with baby carrots , barbecue boston butt , baked lemon pepper chicken , broccoli casserole , mac&cheese , candied yams , and hot buttermilk cornbread muffins , oh I forgot the potato salad . 
HEY FB FAMILY , I JUST WANT TO SHOUT OUT AND GIVE < PROPFEMALE > TO GOD . TODAY WAS THE 1ST DAY IN A LONG TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN PAIN FREE , I THANK GOD FOR GIVING OUR DR'S THE KNOWLEDGE TO HELP US ? 
ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE ? 
Before You JUDGE ME Walk IN MY SHOES , Before You Talk About Me Get To Know Me , Before You TELL LIES Just REMEMBER It Will COME BACK To YOU 1000 Times WORSE ! 
wants to know , what is ONE thing you CANNOT live WITHOUT ? 
Giving from the heart means that you never expect anything back in return . 
Haters don't really hate u , they hate themselves . U are a reflection of what they wish to be . 
you are who you are and that's all you can be ... look at the world and say this is me , take it or leave it ... who cares what others think 
When God gives you children , you have been truly blessed . When God gives you grandchildren , your cup runneth over . I love all of them so very much . 
Think twice before judging others , for you wouldn't want others to start judging you ! 
No weapon formed against me shall prosper , and every tongue which rises against me in judgment though shall condemn . < PROPMALE > 54:17 
When it all comes down to nothing - God is up to something :) 
Before people start pointing fingers and saying this is pretty , this is not , they should remember ... Sometimes the ugliest people live behind the prettiest faces 
You realize your old when you hear snap , crackle , pop in the morning and realize it's not the cereal but your body . 
Don't complain about trials in life , God gives us free will , don't go back to the old ways that results in negative outcomes . Take UR Faith and press ahead 
corny joke : a family of tomatoes is crossing the road , baby tomatoe falls behind , daddy tomatoe smacks baby tomatoe on the head and says \ketchup \"" 
Be careful who you give your love to , for some men L.O.V.E simply stands for Legs . Open . Very . Easily . </3 
wanting a warm body lying next to me holding me in there arms whispering ill never let you go 
we all have many WANTS in life , we need to be thankful for what we have , and really think if those wants are what we actually NEED !! 
When you ask for my opinion , be prepared to hear the unfiltered truth . 
When life makes you slip and fall get back up and show everyone what you are made of !! 
Although I may stand alone , I still sand for what I believe in . 
Life is to short to have regrets so if you truly love someone tell them or you will regret it for a long time ! 
doesn't understand why people lie when there was no need to lie in the first place ... 
Life brings us troubles and hardships to see how you handle pressure , you don't appreciate happiness until you have experienced sadness 
I've been told that i am too old for a lot of things ... but actually i think i am just coming to the age to appreciate those things even more (: 
LIFE = the past was a blessing the present is a gift and the future will be a surprise , so < PROPFEMALE > what you had , enjoy what is now and await for what is to come . 
I feel life has given me great privilege's & love . It is up to me to \ 
choose wisely , give back , expect nothing in return ; and make \ 
the most of it all ! 
We all have loves in our lives ... NONE greater than a \MOTHERS LOVE\ " . No one will ever Love you like your MOM ! " 
Good morning fb family hope you all have a very blessed and happy day today , and also a quick remimder to us to get out and vote as Obama says YES WE CAN :) 
My kids make life worth living couldn't do it without them . Love you guys with all my heart . 
First treat yourself with love and respect and you will attract people who show you love and respect ! ;~)) 
The strongest people aren't always the people who win , but the people who don't give up when they lose . 
If something happens once its < PROPMALE > , if it happens twice it's coincidence , if it happens a third time , pay attention ! 
Gratefulness is the key to a happy life that we hold in our hands , because if we are not grateful , then no matter how much we have we will not ever be happy . 
~ \There are so many advantages to growing old . The problem is that you tend to forget what they are \".~" 
thinks her friends are the best . They've always got her back , stand beside her no matter what and she knows they they are always there ... I love you all <3 
Nothing melts a heart like a grandchild will :) 
just loves the people who put their business on here , then complain because everybody is in their business !! 
i am who I am - I am not gonna change just so you can like me . if you have a problem with that , feel free to take a walk . 
Age is just a state of mind ... now if only my body believed that too . ~ k 
We're not in this world to live up to your expectations and we're not in this world to live up to mine . We're here to live up to God's! 
Knows : That her one true weakness will always be , and has always been her children and grandchildren !!! 
GOOD NIGHT FB FAMILY I PROBABLY BE OUT OF TOUCH FOR A FEW DAYS I9 HAVE MY BEAUTIFUL GRANDAUGHTER WITH ME FOR A FEW DAYS . SO ALL MY TIME IS WITH HER , EACH MOMENT I SPEND WITH HER IS PRECIOUS TO ME . SHE IS TRULY THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE AND A 21/2 YR OLD HANDFUL LOL 
Is in need of a shoulder and a someone to hold her in there arms while she crys , and they ask no questions . Just say everything will be OK . 
Never listen to what other people say someone has said . Go to the person directly and talk to them . You might find what you were told was wrong or it was a lie . 
a cute guy will open your eyes ... a smart guy will open your mind ... a loving guy will open your heart ... and if your lucky you will get all these in one 
wonders why people claim to be Christians but still gossip and tear other peoples lives apart . 
When you stretch ( like when you first wake up ) , you raise your arms above your head . Coincidence ? I think not . We were designed to praise God ! 
when a person is mad , they often say things they don't mean .. but it's NEVER too late to say \I'm sorry\ " even if it's months down the road ! " 
The only time I got a timeout when I was a kid , was when the belt broke and my Mom had to find\something\ " else " 
FB fam what do you do when you body shuts down and your brain wants to keep going and going , pain is the devil , but to GOd be the < PROPFEMALE > 
Lord I'm hurting fb fam , does anybody have any suggestions to stop this pain lortab 10mg isn't helping anymore somebody give me some ideas to kick ARTHUR(itis ) to the curv , 
Hey FB family I am on my way to see Fantasia tonight , I am not feeling well but I'm going anyway . I hope I will enjoy this nite out it has < PROPMALE > awhile , nite nite I will check in later 
No matter how bad life may seem , Everyone has something in their life to be thankful for . The key is not to dwell on the bad , but to appreciate the good ! 
is so excited for the new lesson life has to offer today , please God make it an easy one ; I have been learning a lot of tough ones here lately ! 
The only difference between saints and sinners is that every saint has a past while every sinner has a future . 
having someone to love is family , having somewhere to go is home , having both is a blessing .. thank you God for all my many blessings . 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS TO ALL MY FB FAMILY AND FRIENDS , HOPING EVERYONE HAD A VERY JOYOUS DAY TODAY

< PROPFIRST > McDonald crazy ass just killed Burger < PROPMALE > in front of Popeye's over that bitch < PROPFEMALE > . The funeral is at Church's are you going 
Have you ever noticed no matter how bad you feel , looking into the eyes of your grandchildren makes everything feel better 
No I don't get jealous when I see my exes with another women , my mom always taught me to give my used toys to the unfortunate . 
Its hard too let go of something you never really had but , its even harder when you know its everything you ever wanted </3 
I wish I could have my morning coffee with all my friends , in person , everyday ! \ 
Cheers y'all! <(_) 
Visualizing a dream will never make it a reality . To be successful , you must take the first step by putting one foot in front of the other towards your goal . 
wants her face in the sun , her feet in the sand and a drink in her hand ! 
Just a closer walk with thee , < PROPMALE > it Jesus is my plea , daily walking close to Thee , let it be dear Lord , let it be . 
erstand me . The truth is , no one knows who I really am . If you can't read my mind , don't assum 
was Made by God , Saved by Mercy , Touched by Grace and Filled with the Holy Spirit , Please Handle with Care ! 
Life is like a diaper , once its full of crap , its time for a change 
hates it when people judge you on what they are told or what they see ... get too know me first :/ 
Prayer is the ultimate Wireless Connection ! 
FB family please pray for me , I just got a call I have to go into the hospital for a heart procedure in the morning , again please pray for me thanks 
Good morning fb fam , just an update , first thank all of you for your prayers i really need them right now , the dr's are trying to figure out how to stop this leak in my heart valves , so that means more procedures the next wk , i'm ok just want to be ok and be healthy , so please fam keep the prayers coming luv my fb fam :) 
Thank You for EVERYTHING that I am going through right now , even though it may not be what I want ... Lord , You know what I NEED . Amen 
Don't complain about having no shoes , until you have talked to the man with no feet 
Friends come and go just like the seasons , but it is the ones that stick around that are in your life for a reason . 
~ Expecting the best from yourself brings out the best in others in some strange way\ 
and when everyone is at their best the results can only be positive . ~ 
If you didn't see it with your own eyes , or hear it with your own ears , don't invent it with your small mind and share it with your big mouth . 
Just like taking baby steps , there are times when u need to look 4 the little blessings in your life in order to not get lost while looking for the big miracles 
Someone calling them self a Christian just because they go to church , is like calling yourself a mechanic just because your standing in a garage . 
Wonders how different life would be if everyone told the truth and no one knew how to lie ! 
is grateful for the people and things in her life that make her life worth while 
Do not mistake silence for acceptance . Just because I don't confront your lies doesn't mean I'm stupid & naive . You are just not worth the effort . 
wishes some people could admit when they are wrong and quit blaming everyone else for their actions ! 
.. is old enough to say I've done it , and young enough to do it again . 
A woman is at her best when she's silent ... so don't take her quietness for weakness . Take it as a warning of , HELL is about to break loose !!! 
is thankful for all of the people I have met and shared even one moment with . You have made up this thing called my life . I love that you are a part of it . 
God has a way of taking care of things . Just sit back and watch the show . 
Finds it interesting ( and irritating ) that some people don't want anything to do with you anymore and can be so mean to you , until they need something from you . 
Be happy with what you have . If you spend your life looking for greener pastures , you might find yourself too old to climb the fence . 
is human and is bound to make mistakes ... otherwise I would have come with a instructional < PROPMALE > ! 
The day I had my firstborn was the happiest day of my life . The day I had my last , was the day I knew my life was complete . 
Sometimes treating someone exactly as they treat others is a dose of their own medicine that they just can't handle :P < PROPFEMALE > BABY ... < PROPFEMALE > 
This journey they call Life , is not suppose to be easy or fair ! As long as we have family , friends , and belief , we can do anything we need to in this journey . 
real friends stick by each other no matter what , real friends may not agree with decisions you make in life but they'll never turn their back on you ! 
remember 1 thing . It's not your place to judge me , that's GOD'S job . 
STRONG WOMEN : we may bend and crack but we never break ! 
If you do the seeking ~~~ God will do the speaking ! 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRLFRIEND WISH I WAS IN THE ATL TO HELP YOU CELEBRATE YOUR DAY WE WILL CELEBRATE LATER LUV U ENJOY :) 
DID EVERYONE HEAR < PROPMALE > SEASE DIED TODAY RIP 
Just loves to get a text from that someone special in my life ... puts a big smile on my face and makes my day ! 
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY TO MY FACEBOOK FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
GOOD MORNING FB FAMILY \TO GOD BE THE GLORY \"" 
.... the most important people in our lives accept us for who we are .. not who they think we should be 
Being with people you love gives our heart a reason to keep beating . 
Live life to the fullest everyday cause you never know what tomorrow holds or if tomorrow will ever come and < PROPFEMALE > every moment with your family and friends 
Yep , it is true what they say about there being a reason certain people don't make it to your future ... as we need to make room for the better things in life 
Before you criticize someone , walk a mile in their shoes . That way , when u criticize , you're a mile away and you have their shoes . What are they going to do ? 
You can change your hair . You can change your clothes . You can change your name . But you can never change who you are inside . 
People who ask my advice ; best be ready for the truth ! 
You will never posses what you are unwilling to pursue 
Thank You Lord , for everything that I have had , do have and will have . Whatever I get , it came from You , Lord . Thank You . Amen . 
Faith makes : Yesterday a stepping stone , today a new beginning , tomorrow a limitless possibility ! 
knows that a smile is a language that even babies understand ... it costs nothing , yet gives much ; takes only a moment , but the memory of it may last forever . 
believes that life is the journey between who you were , and who you are meant to be . the choices you make and the chances you take . 
says ..... \a positive mind thinks positive thoughts and gets positive results ! \"" 
Life is like one big book so take your time to understand it because every chapter has many meanings and lessons to be learned . 
Faith is taking the first step even when you cannot see the staircase - In every step of our life we need to trust that God is guiding us . 
Life is gonna knock you over , simple as that , but you have to have the guts to stand up and fight back . 
I'm a strong women , but even the strong can be knocked down . I will pick myself up and become even stronger . I will be who I am by choice not by circumstance . 
Dear Lord Please bring my grandchildren up in this world with a happy , healthy and compassionate heart . Bless them in ways that they may pass it on to others . Amen 
... says that God does have a plan ... It's just kind of hard to read the blueprints through the tears sometimes . 
None have sacrifices more for me then my mother And for that alone i owe her my life . Every day i thank god for my mother who always loves me no matter what . 
Just remember when you need to talk to someone and it's too late to call a friend , God is always up ! 
Be more concerned with your character than your reputation . Your character is what you really are , while your reputation is merely what others think you are 
Good evening my fb family and friends , after a month of testing i am finally going into the hospital tomorrow morning for heart surgery i ask for your prayers please . AND AS SOON AS I'M BETTER I WILL BE BACK ON LINE SO TAKE CARE MY FB FRIENDS ' TO GOD BE THE < PROPFEMALE>' 
The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time & with Jesus by our side , we never have to struggle thru any of them alone :) 
Accept where you are , remember where you've been , but most importantly , know where you want to be . 
I simply won't settle for anything other than everything . And I'm OK with nothing rather than something that isn't the everything I'm looking for . =) 
Everyone is someone , make sure they feel like it . 
Tomorrow is not promised and the past cannot be changed therefore live each day to the fullest and know that every new day is a blessing 
At least three times every day take a moment and ask yourself what is really important . Have the wisdom and courage to build your life around your answer . 
This awesome day is brought to you by GOD . 
is never going to regret getting old ~ too many people don't get that privilege <3 
Life is a blessing that you only get to live one day at a time . So make each day a new memory because tomorrow a memory may be all that is left . 
There are a lot of ways that you can start your day , but the most important way is with prayer . 
You say : \I can't manage\ " God says : I will supply all your needs . ( Philippians 4:19 ) "
