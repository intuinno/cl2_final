NEW YEAR ! Happy one to you all ! 

OH ! On top of the happy new years to all , I would advise you to gaze outside for this once-in-a-lifetime spectacle . If you live within 10 minutes of School you will see the wonderous sight of ... Zombie Fog ! Don't believe me ? take a little stroll outside and see for yourself . Just be sure to bring your cricket bat ... just in case ... 
Meh , changes start tomorrow , that's for sure 
Bored ....

actually , he IS coming on , if you tune in quick , he should be right up ! hooray ! 
ok , maybe delayed just a bit more , but they said he'd be there ! 
nevermind . stupid MSNBC 
By the way , I watched 3 hours of the most ignorant News I've ever seen that day . Seriously , was it made for children with chronic short term memory loss ? 
For all of you basketball people out there , practice is at the < PROPFIRST>'s hill golf course , tee box 9 today at 5:00 .

Oh btw , my locker has extra shelf ... so already the school year is lookin good ! : D 
Sore from getting the Senior Scythe ( As I've decided to name it ) and navigating the river of painful rocks .

I think you should know this : I shall never give you up , nor shall i ever attempt to let you down . I would never scurry about and leave you for gone .

Back in the ' burg for the weekend ! Wooh Air Conditioning ! 
Back at UVA ! Wooh ! Time to ... do something ! 
Just accidentally slept through one of my favorite classes .... \ 
This is not a good start to the day 
MUST CONCENTRATE ON STORY WRITING ! ARGH ! So many distractions !!!! And there's no button on my laptop to turn the internet off ! Ah ! And now I'm writing a facebook post complaining about not being able to do homework , which in turn is procrastinating my homework ! AHHHHHH !!!!! 
Writing sad stories makes me sad , and then I feel bad for the characters , so I add something happy , but then I remember that it has to be sad , so I take away the happy thing , and I feel as if I've just brainwashed them and removed all of their memory of the happy thing .... * sigh * writing fiction is stressful . 
Just when I thought had the cha cha down , they go and add another sequence to double it's length . * sadface * 
Nothin doin ' today . may catch up on some Psyche , hmmmm . 
Hanging in the Tuttle Lounge writing a story ... there is no one else in here .... and it's a little creepy . 
English teacher assigned us reading in our book that's 40 pages long but is spread throughout 155 pages , and we're given no time to read the rest of the parts we missed on our own ...... what ? \ 
For the first time I want to read a school book , but teacher says no , just skip these parts .... I don't know how to act with this . I want my context !!! 
likes this . 
Just realized you can scroll sideways with your mouse through Facebook photos .... mind slightly blown .

Printer decided to make this my lucky day and suddenly run out of black ink MID PAPER , 4 minutes before i have to leave for class . \

Sick and reading bogged . . . Where in the world is Saturday when you need it ? 
Why does Facebook even allow someone to ' like ' their own status ? I can't imagine anyone but a lonely shut in , desperate for attention and laughter would do this . 
HOME , HOME ON THE RANGE !!!! 
So long Fredericksburg ! I shall miss thee ! 
Hate having good dreams in the morning . The rest of the day pales in comparison . : ( 
English paper , midterm tomorrow , reading to do , story reviews to write . * sigh * 
Have been laying in bed for the past 4 1/2 hours trying to go to sleep . Today , the gods are cruel . 
Can hear Journey playing outside my window ... not sure what for ... 
This just in : Kanye West , apart from lettin ' ya ' finish , apparently just REPLACED his entire bottom row of teeth with gold and diamonds . No , not braces , or grills , or even coated . HE RIPPED OUT HIS TEETH AND REPLACED THEM WITH < PROPFEMALE > AND GOLD . When asked why he said , \I thought it was cooler . \ " \ 
No Official Ballroom instructor today ? Piles of Homework as large as Olympus Mons ? \ 
Sorry Ballroom , but until next Monday , we must part . 
Okay < PROPMALE > , Okay . You've got a History Midterm Due Monday . You're just starting it now . You're at the Library , a place of calm . Focus ... Focus ... * post a Facebook status on just how focused I am * 
Trying to write midterm , listening to white noise to block out sound of library , headphones cord finally dies once and for all . Oh well , no problem , brought a backup pair just in case . Suddenly left ear of those headphones die . \ 
Seriously ? Is there some force that WANTS me to fail this ? 
\okay super-glue 
Riding downhill to class today when suddenly i hear a ' pop ' and my pedals are swinging freely with no impact on the tires . \

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE EVERYONE !!!!!! In order to keep the masses , ( AKA , like , 3 people and family ) from assaulting me with questions , I have an important announcement to make !!!! Because of a very near game of ' Assassins ' that is to be played , I shall be hiding my identity on facebook . What does this mean ? Well , it means I am changing my name on facebook to < PROPMALE > KANE until the duration of the game . 
Achievement Unlocked\ 
50G - Biked to the Top of the Hill by Kellog without stopping . 
Apparently just because you study for a test doesn't mean you'll do well on it . In-fact , it seems when I don't study , I did exceptionally better .... this just makes me so happy ... 
My cover for assassins has been blown ! That , or my target thinks I'm a creeper . Neither are good things . 
My quote for \Fake Quote Friday\ " :\ 
I believe Facebook should become a bit more creative , and so , I am \

Wooh ! just saw all my Ballroom peeps live ! yeah ! you all looked awesome ! 
You know you read too much < PROPMALE > Potter when you get into an argument about why the 5th movie would have been vastly improved with the inclusion of the tentacle brain monsters . 
... 
Just thought of an amazing name for a Coffee brand :\ 
\Elevator\ " \ 
Just finished an incredibly long day of classes , and now onto picking classes for next semester . \ 
On a side note , I literally haven't all day , so if someone I knew were to inexplicably show up to Tuttle 115 with a Ciabatta breaded beef and cheese sandwich , I would love them forever and ever , until the end of time itself . \ 
I would literally love you until the Heat Death of the Universe . Just saying . 
Nirja and < PROPFEMALE > have my undying love forever !!!!!!! \ 
The ferocious grumbling of my stomach has been appeased ! \ 
Thank you soooooo much !!!! <3 x 400,000,017 
Anyone want to hedge bets on what < PROPMALE > potter will make ? \ 
To put it in perspective , Half Blood < PROPMALE > earned $ 934,000,000 worldwide and toy story 3 with just over a billion worldwide . \ 
My guess ? I'd say a good 1.4 to 1.6 billion worldwide . I know , so much fun to guess ! Hahaha . Anything to distract me from my ENWR paper I guess . 
inb4 \OH MY GOD < PROPMALE > POTTER WAS SO AWESOME !!!!! 1111 !!! <3<3<3<3 !! \"" 
Hmmm , sleep , or wait until Diplomacy Orders go through ? \ 
BAHAAHAHAHA SLEEP ! Who needs you ?! 
Hour left till English deadline for essay . Fingers moving at blazing speeds . Go go go go go GO ! 
I hath met evil , and his name is Chico . 
Back home , finally able to relax and take some stock of life . 
I wish for time to stop , to freeze in its fateful path . My life is too bundled , too strangled , too confused , to be unraveled any other way . As the mountains crowd around me , I can only duck my head and continue to work , hoping the click of my keys shaves stones off their peaks . 
* reaches a hand out from the sea of paper * \ 
Random bystander : \Oh my god ! Here ! Take my hand ! \ " \ 
Ahhh . There is no more relaxing feeling than splurging on photoshop for a couple hours while you know you should be writing . But I believe the final product was worth it ! \ 
Now , onto that Short Story ... 
This is why you don't let the amateurs release news articles :\ 
\More importantly 
Looking over revisions made on one of my English papers a while back and making sarcastic comments to them , thus taking my mind off my exams . Suddenly I realize we have to turn these physical papers in , comments and all for portfolios . * sigh * Begin the crossing out . 
There is seriously not a single place to sit down and do work in < PROPMALE > . This is ridiculous . It was EMPTY yesterday . Over 100 < PROPFEMALE > study areas downstairs and every single one was filled . Every . Single . One . 
\Come on Fiction Story ! Is that all you got ?! \ " \ 
Successfully found < PROPFEMALE > study corner ! Haha , take that overloaded < PROPMALE > Library ! 
To anyone who has tried to call me or sent me a text in the last 7 hours , I'm underground in < PROPMALE > at the moment , and there is no signal here . Just email me if you'd like me to see it ! 
I've been down in < PROPMALE > for so long , I haven't seen the sun since Noon . Oh , how my hate boils for history . HOW IT BOILS . 
* Got to < PROPMALE > , no space left * \meh 
At the point where I've written a huge amount for an essay , realized that i misunderstood the question , and yet still have correct parts in my essay I don't want to delete . \ 
I've seen dead snails frozen in molasses sliding backwards on a glacier make more progress than this . * sigh * 
\Uh 
Struggling I rise\ 
Back creaking sorrowfully\ 
Curse you vile exams 
\Okay < PROPMALE > 
Trying to work up the will to study for my hardest exam , while at home , with snow outside , which I know I won't get an A on anyway . Not a lot to work with here . \ 
Hence , Facebook . * sigh * 
My Psych Final :\ 
\My Captain does not answer 
An event that occurs once in untold < PROPFIRST > of generations ... and the world slumbers on . Oh the fools . What mind have you to ignore the amazing , the wondrous , the truly unique ? I pity you all , and gaze lovingly into the night sky . \ 
Oh , when will this life cease to amaze me ? A < PROPFEMALE > in an endless sea of ever-shifting sand . 
A < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all , and to all a good night . 
I feel like taking a long , hard look out to sea . Where's the ocean when you need it ? 
About to leave for college tomorrow . Oh , how I shall miss you Sweet home . And Homework , oh my old nemesis . I shall stoke the flame betwixt us once more . 
Hey I have an idea ! Let's try some fresh apple ! I haven't had that in a long .... Yep . Still allergic . I am an absolute idiot . 
Ahhh Photoshop . We don't spend nearly enough time with each other anymore . 
Fear the Honks of the Bard of Rage . 
Come to the AFC today for a free Ballroom Dance lesson ! If you've ever been even remotely interested , try it out ! The lesson starts at 10:15 tonight on the bottom floor of the AFC . \ 
Oh , and any tall girls out there , it's not an option for you . You are required to come . 
Have class at 2 , took a nap till 12:30 , still tired though , and made the fatal mistake of closing my eyes . Woke up again at 1:40 . Whoever is out there looking over my shoulder , thank you . 
It's times like this that I realize how good I had it with a 4 person math class , where every issue we had was quickly addressed and understood . * sigh * 
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYON -- Wait a second ... \ 
AW FRIGGG I MISSED IT AGAIN . 
Never ask about the meaning of Life , for one day you may receive an answer . 
Quite literally just supported an argument in a philosophy paper with something I saw on House . Today is a good day . 
I miss FA ... 
Anybody wanna catch the 7:00 tonight at Newcomb ? Haven't looked up what it is yet , but ... yeah ! text me ! 
Hope all my friends are having a blast at Mid-Atlantic this weekend ! Win those medals ! 
is stressed . : ( 
Here I come homeland of Fredericksburg ! Spring Break Ahoy ! 
Thanks everyone for the Birthday wishes ! My faces went approximately like this that morning --> -.- O.O ^o^ 
Can someone PLEASE explain to me the following :\ 
In my Philosophy class , we are instructed to state which of two papers gives a more compelling argument . My problem with this : How are we supposed to make an acceptable argument for or against either one , when , not only is there complicated PROFESSIONAL evidence in each paper for itself and against the other , but there still isn't a conclusive answer today ?! GAH ! 
I suddenly realized something that made my day a whole lot less happy : 
Ahhh , relaxing in the sun and breeze , working on poetry . Though , I'm not sure I could find a more cliche ( yet effective ) place to be . 
Walking through a hallway today when out of the corner of my eye I see a framed picture of a person I recognize . \ 
I swing around and think , \Bob Barker ?! \ " \ 
Congrats to any FA'ers who got into UVA !! Go Wahoos !!
