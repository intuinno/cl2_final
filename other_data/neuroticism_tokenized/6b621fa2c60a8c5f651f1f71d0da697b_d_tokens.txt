Well bad news . My dad is in the advanced stages of the cancer they are treating it aggressively . I wish there was something I can do . 
PISSED . who the HELL would write evil comments on my Dad's article . Some people are heartless . Who care's if you didn't agree with his articles or topics , or that he writes for those who don't have a voice . He has done so much good for this community and for the less fortunate . they choose to voice their opinions on his brave and personal article about this deadly killer of a disease ? Some people have no tact .
