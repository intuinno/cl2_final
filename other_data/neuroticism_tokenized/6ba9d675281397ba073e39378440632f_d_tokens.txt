My curfew was the street lights , my mom didn't call my cell , she yelled my name , I played outside with friends , not online . If I didn't eat what my mom cooked , then I didn't eat . Sanitizer didn't exist , but you COULD get your mouth washed out with soap . I rode a bike without helmet , getting dirty was OK , and neighbors gave a damn as much as your parents did . Re-post if you drank water from a garden hose & survived
