likes the Tron Soundtrack that he just purchased . Some of these saws are really dirty and gritty ! 

has a New Year's Revolution . 
Anyone got a cool New Years resolution ? 
Hmn . It's interesting how varied coffee types in combination with one another might make a person slightly jumpy , possibly even causing them sing about caffeine . I just need a more supplies and another guinea pig to complete my experiment(s ) . 
I need several more samples of dog urine for my next experiment . Does your < PROPMALE > have to pee ? 
I'm sitting next to some possible guinea pigs . I just need to grab some crazy Buffalo Sauce , a copy of Pan's Layrinth , and some BEP jams . This is going to be the best experiment ever ! 
is upset . I know that the camel and the owl shouldn't have offspring , but it would be so cool if I could get this experiment to work ! 
Please be quiet ! I'm performing several thought experiments at once ! We shall finally see if the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle or the Many-Worlds Theory is correct ! Or not . What do you think I am - a Quantum Mechanic ? Blasted two-four step . 
Anyone wanna give me a free pickle for an experiment ? 
cannot get this song out of his head . Keeps coming back while trying to perform experiments ! Try the following link ( and subscribe to my channel while you're there ! ) : http://www.youtube.com/user/AlanThatSynthGuy#p/f/5/U2me5NdBLPM

is - Rawr ! Sorry ... What I meant to say that after - Rawr ! That last experi - Rawr ! -ment seemed to have created a - Rawr ! - version of - Rawr ! - me that thinks he's a - Rawr ! - dinosaur . Da - Rawr ! ... Never - Rawr ! - mind . 
realizes that in a parallel existence , I might be an opera singer - and a good one , at that ? I have an experiment to perform ! 
is fighting with myself . Apparantly , it's a struggle between what I want , what I need , and what everyone else needs . I'm doing the right thing and putting their needs first , even if it means that I'll be like this for a little while . At least I can look into that next experiment , eh ? 
knows that nothing created is forgotten . The only question is if we forgot about something , was it really within our rights to think about it in the first place ? I must take a break from my experiments and determine whether or not I even have the rights to worry about this . : ) 
wonders if anyone likes my status or my experiments . Please click ' like ' if so . If not , post a nasty comment ! ;) 
is thrashing in my head right now . It's not quiet , that's for sure . I'd try to tell you about it , but my state of mind is a blur . That last experiment was insane , but I'm doing what I can to stay stable . Drat ! What in the bloody abyss ryhmes with ' stable ? ' Silly comatose blankets of quietly drinking tea , those tea drinkers ! Comatose blankets of drinkers , drinking as thinkers .

I'm starting to think that this might have some sort of hidden purpose . Maybe ... Maybe it's not just a mistake , but a meaningful mishap . There's a reason for this ; I just have to figure it out now . 
It's not too dark , yet not too light . It's the perfect shade of black . 
YOU , my darkside , will serve your purpose . God's let YOU live for a purpose . Maybe I should find out why .
