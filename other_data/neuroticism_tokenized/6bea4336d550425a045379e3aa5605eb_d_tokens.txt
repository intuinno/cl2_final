Happy new year ! :) 

just accidentally uninstalled the D drive on her computer ? Does anybody know how to fix this ?? DX 
hates undecorating the tree . On the bright side , my disk drive is fixed ! :) 
Uhh ... What is this AP U.S. packet everyone keeps talking about ? D: 
finished her first AP < PROPMALE > assignment :) 
really wants to see < PROPFIRST>'s Mannequin with the Fray next Wednesday , but doesn't think that's gonna happen . :( 
Moral of the story ? Don't write for four hours without a break . 
Recital tomorrow !!! :) 
is all of a sudden very , very sad that this whole year ( and recital ) went by so fast . Where'd the time go ? 
had a really weird dream last night , and now knows what happens when you mix Supernatural and dance team . 
had a great day with < PROPFEMALE > , swimming and getting slushies from Seven Eleven ! Except for the part where I got bit by spiders . > < 
is about the only person who isn't going to see < PROPFIRST>'s Mannequin tonight . That makes me sad . 
WTF < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > died ... Just , WTF . 
really hates < PROPFIRST > in her story right now , even though SHE'S the one who made him be all mean . :( 
is exhausted , sunburnt , and just maybe a little disappointed ? Good thing partying makes everything better . <3 
was woken up from her lovely dream by her neighbor firing up his chainsaw at nine in the morning , and now has to do hard work . On the plus side , at least it's nice out . :) 
still has the Hercules music stuck in her head . 
is going to work on her landscape watercolor , finally . 
curses writer's block and seriously misses her friends who decided to all be on vacation this week . :( 
has been staring at the same blank document for three days now and is about to go crazy . 
just found out they put her in Spanish 3 Honors . FML 
dinner at < PROPFEMALE>'s tonight then work tomorrow . :) 
is working tomorrow ... Happy Fourth ! :) 
R.I.P. Panic ! At The Disco ( 2004-2009 ) Five good years of closing goddamn doors and reinventing love . 
had a dream last night where her dad bought her a ' 68 Boss Mustang . 
I worry , I wonder all the time , why worry ? It's killing me , forget about it . 
survived her first day at the new job . :) 
work tomorrow , then maybe < PROPFEMALE>'s grad party later ? 
will undoubtedly enjoy tomorrow , not having to work or anything ! 
can't spell for her life today . 
is working tomorrow morning , then shopping in the afternoon with the girls . :) 
Open up a little happiness today ! 
There are but three things in this world that are certain : death , taxes , and commercials . 
has a headache :( 
just got her AP US textbook after like a month of it being lost in the mail from when she ordered it , only to find it's the wrong edition . FML 
is leaving for the beach tomorrow ! Then The Academy Is ... on Tuesday , and I get to see < PROPFEMALE > on Friday !! :D 
is really , really sunburnt . :( But I had a great time at Six Flags with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !! 
is pissed because she got kicked out of the one other room in this house with a TV . > < 
my sunburn now is itchy . But who cares , I get to see < PROPFEMALE > today !! :D 
had an awesome day on the beach with < PROPFEMALE > ! Except for the part where I got by foot pinched by a crab claw and my sunburn started peeling . But other than that it was awesome ! 
100 pages !! 
was sad that she lost her Disney necklace at the mini golf place ... but found it again so it's all good ! 
is coming home from the beach tomorrow . :( 
is home at last ! 
just read some super creepy story and is now kind of freaked out . >.> 
dance team camp , then work tomorrow . In the meantime , lots of writing . Which means I should probably get off of Facebook . 
doesn't have to drive to < PROPFEMALE>'s tomorrow ? 
just spent the better part of the afternoon putting together a chair . 
dance team sleepover tonight then New York for the weekend ! :) 
just got back from New York to be confronted with a ton of stuff to finish before school starts . 
is lucky 13 . 
writer's block isn't actually a block . It's a fifty-foot brick wall with lights and towers and rolls of barbed wire at the top . 
\Carry on my wayward sonnn ... There'll be peace when you are donnnneeeeee ... \ " Watching season 2 finale of the Tudors ! xD " 
is working early tomorrow and Friday . And on her birthday . 
is seventeen . :) 
has had a pretty awesome birthday so far ... thanks in part to all the dance pictures/stuff < PROPMALE > up on the walls and blue & black party decorations . :) 
Snape ! Snape ! Severus SNAPE ! 
HELLO PLOT TWIST . 
ONE MORE CHAPTER ! 
' s iPod isn't working ?? 
IS FINISHED . :D 
It sounds like someone is banging tribal drums outside my house ... 
really kind of wants to throw something at the wall right now . 
\I'm gonna do tae kwon fu ! \"" 
shopping tomorrow , last day of summer !! :( 
So apparently everyone hated their first day of school ? This is not encouraging for me ... 
< PROPMALE > year ... Here goes nothing ! 
got her facebook to work again finally . 
babysat a two-year-old and now has the < PROPMALE > tattoo on her hand to prove it . xD 
finished the story FINALLY ! IT'S DONE . Now on to my Spanish composition . :/ 
Everyone's away for the weekend wtf 
I've become a simple souvenir of someone's kill . I'm like the sea , constantly changing from calm to ill . 
Dance tonight ... here we go again . xD 
Supernatural season 5 tonight !! :) 
Okay , so that was so intense is defies description . 
Working ... as if anybody's gonna come into McDonalds on a day like today . > < 
Dance team tomorrow ... then some epic lulz later with Onyi and Elle ? 
is exhausted from dance , but it went all right . Except for getting lost on Poorhouse Road , and my pants ' epic fail . xD 
Everything relates back to SpongeBob . 
Estoy enferma . :( 
still has a little bit of a fever , a wicked headache and has to breathe through her mouth , and has dance tomorrow . :/ 
had an awesome time with < PROPFEMALE > :) but is currently shivering from the coldness of the Starbucks . 
working today from 2-9 > < 
Studying for AP U.S. Or , trying to anyway . :/ 
Ughh I want it to be tomorrow night already . So that my mind is on Supernatural and the weekend instead of AP U.S. and Physics . :/ 
Today is FINALLY over ! 
is finally home ! What an adventure . :) 
needs to stop playing The Office trivia and actually do homework . 
Why is all my homework in every single class due Monday ? 
is very , incredibly , extremely frustrated . And possibly grounding herself for the weekend . 
So I have dance rehearsals every Friday night from now till November , I apparently can't go to homecoming unless I want to chill all alone the entire time , I've got so much homework to finish over the weekend and no time to do it in because of dance and work , I still have to ride the bus to school , and now they might be cancelling Supernatural ? It's official . I hate my life . 
is done . 
wants this weekend to just be over already ... working 3-9 . > < 
has got stuff to do and yet is still on facebook ... :/ 
just watched The Tudors and wants to know why anyone would ever marry < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > VIII . Being his wife is like being the drummer in Spinal Tap . 
I miss my < PROPFIRST > . And by ' < PROPFIRST >,' I mean my keys , and by ' miss , ' I mean left them in the < PROPMALE > room at school . :/ 
So incredibly tired all of a sudden ... But Supernatural's on tonight and no school tomorrow ! Oh , and I finally got my keys back . :) 
I think that was the most intense baseball game I've watched in a long time . Go Yankees ! :D 
Had an awesome time at Frightland , the Yankees won , and the Angels beat the demons- I mean Red Sox . Good weekend . <3 
So I just watched the crack episode of Bones . Which is funny because I didn't even know Bones made crack episodes . But they do . Complete with mood whiplash . 
ughhh PSATs tomorrow ... but a half day and then Subway for lunch ! :) 
No , I do not want to join Cafe World . I do not want to join Mafia Wars or YoVille either . I already play Farmville , and I think one complete time-wasting game is enough , thankyouverymuch . 
Was anyone else psychologically disturbed by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > skipping down the street holding balloons ? 
I found my spider ring ! :) 
Work today ... and it's still freezing cold out . What's more , I don't think it'll warm up anytime soon . > < 
Iron Hill for < PROPMALE>'s bday dinner , then dance later . :) 
Class ring ceremony tomorrow . Oh , joy . 
At the end of the day I can always be thankful that I now have a shiny class ring and not the swine flu . :) 
It's not that I hate physics , it's just that I have no clue what any of it even means . This entire chapter was like Greek to me . Now , off to prepare for the first in a series of four tests this week ! FML FML FML 
Why do they always change Facebook just as soon as I get used to the old one ?? 
is listening to the Distillers and wondering how one person can scream this much . My throat hurts just listening . xD 
wants to dress up as the swine flu on Friday ... if anyone has a white doctor's coat , just lemme know . :) 
Okay , so screw the swine flu thing . Costume idea #34 : a < PROPMALE > and a PC from the commercials . You heard it here first . 
Today was pretty much the Lol factory . 
learned three things this Halloween : blackjack tacos from Taco < PROPFEMALE > are the greatest tacos ever , don't ever question my brother when he orders Mountain Dew at nine in the morning , and think happy thoughts or < PROPFIRST > will send you to the cornfield . 
I miss Mr. R already . And I don't even take Latin . 
needs serious help with the DBQ essay for AP US . > < 
finally finished the DBQ ! 
Forgot how much she loves crack episodes , of any show for that matter ... Anyways , AP < PROPMALE > trip tomorrow . :) 
thinks she has unleashed a monster . 
Don't you look at me in that tone of voice . 
Does anyone understand physics ? Because I need help . :( 
feels so stressed out right now ... 
This is so weird ... Press Up , Up , Down , Down , Left , Right , Left , Right , B , A , Enter key then scroll up and down . Magic circles will appear ! Super cool but actually kind of annoying , so relaod the < PROPFEMALE > to get it to stop . NOW BACK TO WRITING MY ESSAY . 
finished the DBQ !! :D 
should be in the running for Best Friend of the Year award . xD 
Umm .... why was that interview thing asking me questions about people I have never even heard of ? 
had a fun night in West < PROPMALE > with < PROPFIRST > , decided she likes the Hardy Boys books , and , uh ... channeling her inner < PROPFIRST > ? 
The doorbell just rang about sixteen times . And so it begins . 
got a bunch of new clothes today . :) On the downside , I still haven't even started my homework . > < 
just decided that not only does Kahlan from ' Legend of the Seeker ' look a bit like < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > kind of reminds me of < PROPFIRST > . Guess who just made my OTP list ? 
AP US , probing rat intestines , and three and a half hour rehearsal ? Today was not my day . 
will be at dance for like nine straight hours tomorrow . > < But then Night of Epic at Onyi's! :) 
I'll be sailing on out into Bermuda blue , compass needle breaks like the heart I gave to you ... I've been laying down in the devil's lair , sailing into the sun I'll be baptized there . 
Imma fight till we see the sunlight . 
Dear Supernatural , Please stop failing so epically . Thank you . Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
WHADDYA MEAN , BEETHOVEN WASN'T SO GREAT ? 
Rockband !! :) 
just spent forever digitizing/colorizing a cartoon sketch that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything ... now I should probably start my homework . 
Just discovered slow and fast motion on the DVD with Onyi Mmagu and < PROPFEMALE > Wiggins , a.k.a. things that are only hilarious at 5:30 in the morning , a.k.a. DAMNITSAM <3 
WARTORTLE 
We are the knights who say ... NI ! 
We are now the knights who say ... ikki ikki ikki ptang ! 
has no heat at her house . > < 
White ... as in , I'm dreaming of a white , uh ... snow day tomorrow !! :) 
' s house is heated again ! Just in time for me to leave for snowboarding . :) 
has a four day weekend with NO homework ?? This is almost too good to be true . 
Whoever predicted that < PROPFEMALE > was going to kill that creepy < PROPFEMALE > chick on Legend of the Seeker , I'm glad you were right . xD 
RA RA RA AH AH < PROPFE < PROPFE < PROPFEMALE > LE > LE > RO < PROPFE < PROPFEMALE > LE > < PROPFE < PROPFEMALE > LE > GAGA OOH LA LA and it will probably be stuck in my head for the rest of my life . 
is watching the Bible Fanfiction Show . 
You got me ringin ' hell's bells . 
THUNDERSTRUCK . 
DUDE IT'S NATIONAL LADY GAGA DAY 
\On tonight's all-new episode of BONES - Brennan and Booth investigate remains that allegorize biblical text . Catch it tonight at 8/7c ! \ " GREAT MORE BIBLE FANFICTION " 
got out of school early and it still hasn't even started snowing ?? Not that I'm complaining . 
Everything I was supposed to do got cancelled , leaving me to have hot chocolate and homemade crepes , and watch Bones . Best snow day ever . :) 
watched a whole ton of episodes of Bones yesterday , and decided that Agent Booth is my new favorite TV person . Sorry , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . xD 
WHY DO THEY FEEL THE NEED TO CHANGE THE FACEBOOK LAYOUT AS SOON AS I'M USED TO THE OLD ONE ?? THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE . 
I GOT THE POWER ! After two hours of not having it . Thanks a lot , PECO Energy people . 
THIS IS THE BEST WEEK EVER . 
Does anybody know the chapters for the next AP U.S. unit ? 
wonders why she didn't download \The Fame Monster\ " before now . This album is awesome <3 " 
It's snowing , again . But at least there's a Supernatural marathon on TNT to keep me entertained . :) 
I hate school . I know it's been said but I really really seriously mean it . 
It's official . I hate everything . 
Today was an adventure . :) 
knows she should probably have worked on her essay instead of watching Supernatural but feels so much less stressed for some reason so it was probably worth it . :) 
IS GOING TO FINISH THE APPLICATION FOR THE JUNIPER WRITER'S THING TOMORROW IF IT KILLS HER . 
feels pretty certain that by tomorrow the school admin is gonna call in the National Guard , the Pope , the President , the fire department , the Powerpuff Girls , the Winchesters ( I wish ) , and maybe even a SWAT team to have an emergency crisis intervention all because of one little fake Facebook profile . 
Shake the Quake <3 and hopefully Charcoal Pit after 
On the bright side , day one of the next Three Horrible Days is finally over . 
Life is back to normal . Although that's kind of a relative term ... 
New York tomorrow . <3 It'll be fun . 
Dear City of Wilmington , you should probably start thinking about filling in the 23428q489 potholes along < PROPMALE > Street . Kthanks . Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Such a lovely warm day , and I had to spend it working the drive-thru at McDonald's . Goodbye weekend and hello another endless , stress-filled week at school . :( 
When Metallica songs begin to accurately describe my life , that's when I know there's a problem . 
IS DONE PERREGRINO'S RESEARCH PAPER 
If it weren't for the map I keep in the Mustang , I'd probably be halfway to Baltimore by now . But I got practically a whole new wardrobe for under ten bucks so the adventure was way worth it . :) 
It's a stick , it's a tree ... No , it's LAMPPOST MAN ! 
\Why haven't Ah met < PROPFEMALE > fishin ' buddy ? \"" 
has my AC/DC shirt and all is well with the world . ( ... Except for the precalc test tomorrow . FML ) 
will be driving to dance today with the convertible top down :) 
has a new baby cousin Finnian ! :) 
Driving home today = best one-person party in the history of the world . xD 
So other than the chapter on slavery , the chapter on the sixties is definitely the most depressing one in this whole 1000+ < PROPFEMALE > textbook . 
rehearsal now , < PROPFEMALE>'s later ... for the first time in like a year . xD 
Dear Citizens ' Bank , I don't care if you have 135q374 branches in the tristate area . How about actually keeping them open when I need to go in and cash my check ? Sincerely , your very irritated customer . 
was writing an essay for Mama Bird when I tried to reference < PROPFIRST > Dean/1950s/conformity type stuff . Then I got really confused when I looked at it again and my essay read \tacos . \ " Thanks a lot < PROPFIRST > Koperna . " 
Everyone should go to Evening of the Arts tomorrow at Ursuline , 5- 8:30 pm ! 
Revenge is a dish best served cold .

If anybody at UA needs the Panorama book ( Spanish 3 honors ) , the AP Composition Skills workbook ( AP English Language ) , or the Solutions Guide for Calc I with Precalc ( Pre-Calc honors ) , hit me up ! 
And so begins that last day of sweet freedom . :( 
just made and packed the first peanut butter and < PROPFEMALE > sandwich of what is likely to be a very long semester . 
one of those days where all I want to do is curl up and go back to sleep ... 
is rockin the short-shorts-and-fuzzy-boots look . I guess that makes me a hypocrite lol 
went fishing . Good day <3 
has the mother of all colds . :( 
bought DVDs for the senior lounge ! Except apparently the DVD player in there doesn't work . Somebody get on that . 
So seniors can now watch DVDs on the PlayStation in the lounge thanks to me , Onyi Mmagu , < PROPFEMALE > Scales , and Matanda . 
Maybe if there were like an extra six hours in every day I wouldn't be so stressed . Except then I'd probably get more work to make up for it . 
COLLEGE ESSAY = DONE . And I must say , this is a < PROPFEMALE > essay . :) 
forgot how much I love rainy days when I can just be lazy all the time ... I didn't even change out of my PJs until like 3:30 when I had to change for work . 
Dance team , class , auditions tomorrow , then work for two days and maybe even -gasp- a few spare hours here and there to get my homework done ! I hate this weekend . 
I hate when I'm watching TV and I see a McDonald's commercial . 
Hill Like White Elephants essay ?

I know there are other fish in the sea but unfortunately I live in a < PROPFEMALE > puddle . blahblahsighangst

used my leftover tissue paper from the fashion show to wrap my brother's birthday present ... now that is recycling . 
The green-eyed monster hath reareth its ugly head ... I mean , I guess I could just say I'm jealous , but I think talking like a Shakespeare wannabe makes me sound smarter . 
GOT MY FIRST COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE !!! AT ROANOKE :D 
So I was looking up a word in my Spanish-English dictionary when I saw an entry for \AC/DC . \ " I got really excited to write about this awesome band for my < PROPFEMALE > sentences until I realized the dictionary wasn't talking about them at all . "

I woke up this morning and my mom wouldn't let me drive to school cause of the snow . SLEEP , OH MY LOVE HOW I HAVE MISSED YOU <3 
Snowboarding !! be back Sunday :) 
Someone tell me why the cabin I stayed in this weekend , which was located in the middle of nowhere as far as I'm aware , was warmer than my actual house . 
They'll never take me alive . 
Just when I couldn't get any more confused about my life , my school can't even decide whether we're having a snow day . Nobody can make up their mind anymore , it seems . 
I'm tired of trying , your teasing ain't enough , fed up of biding your time when I don't get nothing back ? 
Stop the rain from falling , keep my ocean calm , this time I know nothing's wrong :) 
The only bad part about getting off work early is I planned nothing to fill the extra hour . I'm bored , text me if you feel like it . 
being random at < PROPFEMALE > Equality Hess ' s house . :) 
Just when I am about to go insane in this house , to the point where I am actually looking forward to school tomorrow ... it starts to snow . fml 
Everything I do , I just set myself up for disappointment . 
The lioness has rejoined her cub , and all is right in the jungle . :) 
Dear psychology homework , I win this round . You have been a worthy opponent . Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I just realized I have an article for the newspaper due on Thursday , and I have no idea what to write about . Anybody have ideas ?

So about how I'm working during the super bowl ? Yeah this is going to be the slowest most boring shift in history . Somebody text me or something . :/ 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day happens infrequently enough that each time it comes around I've forgotten how much I hate it . 
Go on and take it , take it all with you , don't look back at this crumbling fool , just take it all with my love <3 
I just gave myself the biggest most dramatic pep talk ever ... like the American flag should have been waving behind me while the star-spangled banner played in the background . Now to see if my advice to myself actually works :/ 
For the jeans day tomorrow , do we bring in money or donate stuff ? 
is so completely evacuating the lounge tomorrow . > < 
Maybe my whole problem is that I need to get my priorities rearranged . :/

Eating Disorders are not lifestyle choices . They are serious illnesses that affect females & males of all ages & ethnicity . EDs have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness yet only 1 in 10 people receive treatment . In recognition of National Eating Disorder Awareness Week ( Feb 20-26 ) , please re-post to help spread support & compassion for those who continue to suffer in silence . 
When I die , I should become a saint for not punching certain individuals in the face during work today . > <

Working 2-8 . Everybody come to McDonald's . We'll have a party .

Today was so slow that McDonalds basically paid me to do nothing . Literally I took paper out of the reciept machine and made fortunte tellers . 
So apparently my car wouldn't start this weekend because a mouse made a nest in the intake manifold ? What is my life even 
So , yeah . About this English essay due tomorrow . Help . 
may not be everybody's first choice , but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm great at being me . I may not be proud of some things in my past , but I am proud of who I am today . So , take me as I am , or watch me as I walk away . Post if you're proud of being you . 
Little known fact about me : When I'm sleep deprived , I get really upset over things that normally wouldn't bother me . Like I cry at the drop of a hat , swear to God . Been this way ever since I was a little kid . And now , once again , my brain is telling me in its own way to get some sleep . Goodnight all . 
Had a great time at Evening of the Arts ! Congrats to all the artists and musicians who worked so hard for this ! Everyone did a fantastic job :)

< PROPMALE > County Dance Festival tomorrow :) 
So yeah , about how today has been the most physically and emotionally strenuous day of my life ... (\I AM ABOUT TO LOSE CONTROL !! \") But at least I'm calm now and you can come within arm's reach of me without fear of getting decked . I promise . "
