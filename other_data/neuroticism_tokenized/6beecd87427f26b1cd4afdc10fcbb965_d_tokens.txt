Near the end of my 30 day notice , my old roommate just told me it's my fault she can't find a roommate she ' likes ' and that I should help her find one . 
So it snowed again today . The snow covered branches reminded me of < PROPFEMALE > blossoms . :)

Deep breaths . One foot then the other . Don't forget to smile .

Ohmygod have you seen Thor's body ??! 
Miss home :( 
Instead of dyeing my roots purple , the hairstylist dyed my whole head dark maroon without telling me because she didn't want to tell me that she didn't have purple . I'm so upset I want to cry . 
My curfew was the street light . My Mom called my name not my cell . I played outside with friends , not online . If I didn't eat what my Parents cooked , then I didn't eat . Sanitizer didn't exist . I rode a bike without a helmet , and getting dirty was ok . Re-post if you drank water from a garden hose and survived . 
It has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends they will know who they are . 
Yay new piercing ! Industrial :3
