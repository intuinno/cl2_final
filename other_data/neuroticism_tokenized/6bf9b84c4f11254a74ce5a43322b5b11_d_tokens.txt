Ok everyone ! Some of you know already , but I'm heading off to Lander today ;) I'm worried though because of the tornado watch in Wheatland ( 12 < PROPMALE > from Torrington ) and that it's touched down and moving . Plus the golf ball sized hail ... Well , if I don't 

I made it ! I'm back in Lander ! * dances * And with everything intact ;) 
18 at last ! And it's nothing special xD

Reality is really what you make it , and if someone says otherwise they take life to seriously and don't really live it . They play by the rules others have set , and if you do what you want with your life then the world is yours . Make what you will of it . 
First day at work ... Wow is all I have to say . 
Is thinking of posting stories onto my facebook ... That'd make it easier for some people * cough*Kelsey*cough * 
Just got back from Lander -_- It's 1 am !! My car broke down and this is the last time ! I am selling that thing and finding a new one that actually works . So , long story short , I'm carless and dead tired . Any more wonderful info will have to wait until day light where I'm somewhat awake . Goodnight ! 
Finally got to post those pictures ! Yes I know , it's me ... with purple hair ... and a sword . -__- I like it ! ^0^ 
Today I'm going with the Single's < PROPMALE > to go Rafting ... I think it's rafting ... I'm not quite sure , but there's swimming suits involved and a river . Plus food and stuff afterwards ^^ I'm so excited !! 
I feel sicker than a dog today , and I have to work from 11 to 7:15 ... Well , if they send me home I can at least say I tried . * dies * 
I've got Swin Flu and so does my brother ... Just kill me now please ... 
Well everyone , I'm moving to Cali in about a week . I'm going to miss everyone in all the places I've lived . I'm going to miss my jobs , even though I hated them at times . I'm going to miss the snow and the cold weather . Lastly , I'll miss the < PROPMALE > to make new memories , but I'll continue to make new ones in Cali while I keep the old ones in my heart . 
Well everyone , I've been really sick for the past two days and I still have to drive 5 hours to get to Lander on Thursday . Wish me luck and Health ! 
Is now friends with < PROPFIRST > Hebert ^0^ Who some of you might now as the voices of these people > Naruto - Kiba Inuzuka , Inoichi , Mizore , Ebizo Bleach – Sosuke Aizen , Ganju Shiba Fruits Basket – Takei Buso Renkin – Hiwatari And so many more ! * dances * 
Is impatiently waiting for pain meds to kick in -__-* 
Hey everyone ! I got an iPod touch ! My sister got it for me and I love it ! Thank you so much < PROPFEMALE > , I love you so much . 
You know what I will always find extremely funny with baseball ? The hand signals the guy gives to the pitcher . For example \Fast Ball Get It Up\ " \ 
I feel like crap this morning . My guts hurt and my head hurts . Oh well , still gotta work . 
OMG Today I feel WORSE ! How is this possible ? I can't hardly eat , I can't sleep , my heart's acting up making it all worse . Thank you heart problems . And I have to walk my sick ass to work now at 6 am ... Maybe they'll send me home ... 
Ok . The next time I suddenly switch medications without going off the first I give everyone permission to slap me . I thought I felt bad before but this offically sucks big time . Yet , my ass is still up and ready for my 6 am shift -_- \ 
Screw the slapping someone just shoot me . 
Mother life flighted to Billings Hospital last night 
Is very sad 
Dude , my delete button just broke ... -__- 
I'm quite sure today , possibly even this whole week , can't get much worse . 
Have I ever mentioned how much I despise getting my ass up at 6-7 every morning ?! \ 
I'm also dropping my Intro to Religion class . 19 credit hours is indeed to much for me . 
I have come to the conclusion that I am going to try out for UW Idol . I don't really care if I get in or not , but at least I'll be able to say I tried XD 
I got a freakin cold ! Just kill me now . \ 
Though I did go and work out ! Smart ? Not really . 
Woke up this morning , felt even worse , went through my only class today , called into work sick , drugged myself to sleep , and now feel even worse -__- 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Today has been a long day . Mostly due to my lower back killing me entire freakin day . Didn't help that I nearly biffed it and hurt it more . * headdesk * I thing I'm just going to eat , shower , and go to bed . I'll work on homework tomorrow . 
Current Status ? \ 
Pissed the fuck off ! \ 
Why ? \ 
Certain people . 
Dude it's 2:30 and I have to go to bed . I haven't covered everything for my Criminal Justice Exam for tomorrow morning ... but I hope I covered enough . Wish me luck ! 
Two exams tomorrow ... Damn it . 
I think I grew up a little bit tonight . ^_^ 
Upstairs neighbor has been going at it for a good 20 minutes now . Either he's really athletic or she's doing all that work and trust me when I say work . I don't want to call HR because the last thing I would like to deal with is sex night in some guys/girls room . Though I know it's a dudes room because up there is all boys . -_- Just kill me now guys and stick a fork in me because I'm well done . 
So I met this girl named Beccah the other day . I think it was on a mountain top ... Or perhaps a lake ... I can't remember . 
Cheetos and lactose intolerance ... not a good mix . 
Finally back from Spring Break ! Why am I posting so early in the morning ? Meh , can't sleep . A lot happened over Spring Break , but I'm not going to stress over it because I promised I wouldn't .
