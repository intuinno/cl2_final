Gonna be one big year . 

Finally got my Facebooks set up , now here comes the fun part of finding people and getting the ball rolling . 
Weekend , but no idea what to do . =__= 
Endwar status : EFEC steamrolls D.C. and the JSF . Vote is now out on TW's faction for the next war . 
TW decided to go for the EFEC . Do I want to change factions for once ? 
I wish Demonoid would be back up . I want my anime downloads ... =__= 
doesn't like Mondays . Who agrees ? 
Now I remeber why I dun like regular Pepsi ... It taste odd to me . 
Mozilla Firefox : Because Internet Explorer is bad for your health . 
I need to stop being so bored . 
Going to chill all day at Lynee's tomorrow . 
Today was fun . Stayed at Lynee's from 3 to midnight . Played some games , laughed at angsty stuff , watched 300 , and had my eyes burned out from watching a weird episode of the Boondocks , was threated numerous times of being shanked by some random object .... Can't wait till next time . :P 
If pro is the opposite of con , does that mean Congress is the opposite of progress ? 
Well now I'm on Mafia Wars ... And I thought Ogame was bad enough . 
Got new glasses and I'm gonna have fun getting used to them . =__= 
Sunday with no plans for Monday . Can I crash at someone's for Monday ? 
Took a shower and shaved . Shaving alone was a half hour affair alone . X.x 
I got works to do and procrastination is setting in fast . 
So who's gonna stay up all night the the meteors ? 
I have a feeling it's gonna be a long Friday ... 
Off to Zombieland @ 10 
Jamin ' to Breaking < PROPMALE > 
Agh ... I have a feeling it's gonna be a weird week 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu_moia-oVI Yes 
has been neglecting Facebook .... 
Whee .... Halloween . 
plans on staying up to the witching hour ( 3AM ) tonight . 
New classes , who has what lunch hour ? I got B . 
Sometimes I wpnder why that notebook idea died out . 
Turning in at 8:30 ? Man , either I have no life or not enough sleep ... I'm going for the latter over the former . 
Sometimes I wonder what goes on behind the scenes ... 
I eat pizza way ~ too often .... 
FFFFF .... Wireless crap needs batteries . 
bleh ... 
Silence and Shadows ... Rogue ... 
has a dull headache . >.< 
Yelling is not good for one's throat 
Tired and bored ... Tempted to go to bed early . >_> 
Tripp pants today ! O: 
I'm way too addicted to Gal . Civ . II . @_@ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Civilizations_II:_Dread_Lords 
Took a nap , dun think it did me any good . =__= 
Why am I awake so early ..? =__= 
< PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > party tomorrow , plan on bringing my copy of Halo 3 and my controller . Debating on whether or not to bring my junky second one . Also both my accounts are Silver , so now I need to shell out $50 for another year's worth of LIVE . 
Is it just me or has Facebook been more retarded than usual ? 
is watching Trigun . 
Agg ... Watching Trigun . Wolfwood reminds me too much of one of my friends , < PROPMALE > .... =__= 
\When the lights go off you will understand\ " Pain ~ Three Days Grace " 
>.< Go figure , when I get around to talking to an old friend they're forced off five minutes into the conversation . 
* sigh * 
Question : Is it better to tell a lie to not hurt someone and hope they don't find out or just tell the painful truth with a clear conscious ? 
FML 
Gonna start watching some FMA ( Full Metal Alchemist ) 
Aaaaand I just saw a scene of a minor character , Sciezka . < PROPMALE > bookworm and one of her first scenes is her trapped under a pile of heavy books . Reminded me of < PROPFEMALE > considering she goes through 3 books a day it seems . :P 
Who's gonna watch the VGA ( Video Game Awards ) on Spike today ? :D 
is starting to watch Death Note now . 
Scratch Lucario . Vulpix since < PROPFEMALE > took Ninetails . 
And apparently even my horoscope agrees I should do something creative . 
One more day ... 
Did everyone enjoy their < PROPFEMALE > canes ? 
is tempted to go through his Astrology books again . 
is half way through Death Note 
Anybody interested in having a character of theirs in my story ? Still hammering out details and generally WTF I'm gonna be doing with it . 
Jamin ' to Three Days Grace . 
is debating whether or not to shave off my beard for the new year ... 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > and almost the New Year . Where does the time go ? 
Got a couple of awesome shirts ; A Nightmare Before Christmas shirt and a couple band shirts . An 8 gig MP3 player and some small random wolf statues to put around my room . 
Whoo ... Writer's block . 
Heh , all this astrology stuff on Facebook is fun and all , but it's even more fun when I can just do it mysel ! :D 
=__= 
N is for No Survivors . [/random reference ] 
Vegeta : Look at your men , now back to me , now look back to your men , now back to me , I am not your men , I'm flipping you off , now look at the the ground , back to me , where's the Dragon Ball ? It's gone , I threw it , and there's not a damn thing you can—\ 
Burter : * comes back with the Dragon Ball * Here you go . \

Abridged FTW 
\Hmm ... This tea taste like joy now . How horrid . \ " ~ Dr. Ink " 
Watched Run , < PROPFEMALE > , Run in film class today . Was better than I thought . 
Apparently cities and towns that have radio stations that play country music have higher rates of suicide than those that don't . Take that as food for thought . 
is watching Mythbusters 
\Aren't you a little old to be watching Phineas And Ferb ? \ " \ " Yes ... Yes I am . \"" 
God , my gut is killing me . Damn White Castles . X.x 
Should be seeing Avatar later today 
Hunting around on Newgrounds for musics . 
\But I wanna slay zombies with you ..! \"" 
Bleh . Don't you hate it when you lose a game and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth all day ? 
Ugh ... Why am I awake at this hour ? 
is watching Outlaw < PROPFEMALE > 
Apparently , I'm the third most senior member of TG's Endwar Division ( joined January of last year ) . The only two topping me out are the CO ( Commanding Officer ) and BGC ( Brigade Commander ) . To think I would hit Seargent by now if I didn't spend half my time at TG on leave , rather than be a Corpral . 
New classes with people I actually know . It's refreshing . 
It's too early for me to be awake on a Sunday ... =__= 
Not really looking forward to tomorrow ... 
Bleh , now what ? 
You can fix anything with either red roses or duct tape . 
Hmm ... 
What do people think when they see my profile picture ? 
Ergh ... Interruptions 
Whoo , Friday ! Sucks it's just starting ... 
One episode away to #23 ( Outlaw < PROPFEMALE > ) 
You know you're bored when you start looking up Latin phrases and idioms on Wikipedia ... 
There are some days where you just want to lay in bed all day and do nothing . 
So tired ... 
I think I'll just crash for a few hours ... Give or take . =__= 
Hurt my wrist in gym . This sucks . 
You knoww you're having a bad day when you're pissed off to the point where you can't sleep . 
Friday ! 
Well I think I hit a record for compliments on my trip pants . 
Think I'm gonna touch up on my astrology stuffs . 
Yay ! Crappy monday ! 
Had to change a tire at 6 this morning . Made it to school on time still , but that's one way to start a monday ... 
Hmm ... Now I'm starting to remember why I stopped going to Deviantart . The people I know exclusively through that site are drama queens ... 
I love how my current solution to my tiredness is caffine . 
More idle ideas I'll probably start but never follow through on ... Hmm ... 
Plan on getting BF : Bad Company 2 later today . 
I'm gonna be so tired today ... Didn't fall asleep till 1:00 - 1:30 . 
When it comes to the weekends , I have one seriously jacked up sleeping schedule ... 
Ergh ... 
Tossing around ideas and researching Metroid stuff for a fanfic concerning our favorite female bounty < PROPMALE > . 
Damn ... TG's Endwar Division is running on a skeletion crew . * sadface * 
I DON'T HAVE A CAPS LOCK KEY , I HAVE A < PROPFIRST > MAYS KEY ! 
Bleh , why am I awake ? 
Just finished ( the very short ) Elfen Lied anime . And I'm honestly shaking , makes me wish the manga was lisenced for the US ... 
Seems like alturism doesn't go as far as it used to . Maybe I should just stop bothering with it all together . Save myself the trouble . 
Well , I got involved in something I didn't plan on . But now that I am , I feel damn good about doing it . 
Politics , politics , politics ... Who needs ' em ?! 
Ok people . You can stop yelling at me now . Downloading MCR from totally legitimate sources as we speak . 
Aghh ... Allergies . 
Plan on getting a hair cut . Was gonna get it done with today or tomorrow , but now it's been pushed back to next week . 
\All I dream of is waking to you . \ " Comatose ~ Skillet " 
METAL GEAR 
You're a great friend but if the zombies < PROPMALE > us I'm tripping you ... 
is watching Invader Zim . <3 
Yes ... I go rawr 
Iron Man was awesome . Though I thought the end was a little predictable , Conservation of Detail at work . 
is tossing ideas around for some idle writing 
Bleh ... Not sure how to take it . Moving back to the city once I'm done with school . 
Actually might get a commission to write something from an old friend . Excited to see what I'm gonna have to work on . So far , all I know it's gonna be some sci-fi horror/action story . 
Argh ... My knee decided it wants to start hurting now . 
[ insert witty remark here ] 
Man ... Even on Easy , Sins of a Solar Empire's < PROPFEMALE > kicks my ass .... X.x 
On a Full Metal Alchemist bent . Spent the weekend rewatching the entire 52-episode anime . 
Is it Wednesday yet ...? D: 
Rawr .... Being 5'3\ certainly has it's pros and cons . Thanks for pointing the cons out people . " 
About to try out a MMORPG , Air Rivals . 
Hmm .... Now what ? 
is offically graduated . :D 
Haha , found an awesome : Prodigy ~ Voodoo People ? ( Pendulum Remix ) 
My bead bracelet broke while I was asleep ... * sadface *

FFF ... 
Yeah , thanks for everyone who showed up . Yeah fucking right . * is not amused * 
is watching subbed episodes of FMA : Brotherhood 
< PROPFEMALE > MINISKIRTS !!! [/Roy Mustang ] 
Well ... I broke my phone , so I will not be able to text or call anyone until further norice . 
is not amused 
Another sleepless night .... And they say introspection is good for the mind , I'm disenclined to agree . All this spare time does is make me think about things I'd rather not . 
I'll take a potato chip .... AND EAT IT ! < /Light > 
has been playing BF : BC2 with people that are actually competent and commnicating . It's much more fun that way . 
Am I the only one who actually likes being woke up from a thunderstorm ? 
DX 
Like this if you just lost The Game . :D 
Why am I awake ? X_x 
Whoo ! * Another * thunderstorm ! 
lol , Ragequit 
Everything is merely a matter of perspective . Stand up , lay down , turn it around , flip it up-side down , spin it around , look through it , look under it , look past it , look around . Change it up . Just because you're looking , doesn't mean you're seeing . 
You know your city planner is off his rocker when you have to solve a chess puzzle in a POLICE STATION just to unlock a door to another room where there's a weighted switch puzzle in the next level . Oh , Resident Evil , you . At least Silent Hill can get away with it , like the town itself hates you in a sort-of passive aggressive way . RE ? Not-so-much . 
Screw the rules ! I have FALCON PAUNCH ! 
For those who don't know . I've moved back to Chicago . After two weeks of .... complications in the move , I have internet . 
My sniper scope has a reflex sight . Your argument is invalid . 
Apparently the term \Agnst\ " was orginally < PROPMALE > and only entered the English language relatively recently . " 
Logical fallacies are amusing . /geek 
Wireless keyboard fail .... Batteries died

Life is filled with too many \What if ? ' s \"." 
is feeling creative , yet uninspired . 
\Holy crap ! It shoots rockets ! \ " ~ Description sometimes found in shotguns in Borderlands . " 
Okay ... What the fuck . Whoever had the brains to impersonate me and then go and send me a friend request , nice job . I don't appreciate someone going around and putting words in my mouth . I'm in no mood to play your games for people's sad and sick enjoyment . 
Geeze ... Where does my day go ? Woke up at 8 , but it felt like I woke up at like 2 . I need to start writing again , I need to get inspired ... 
needs to organize his room around . =__= 
I wish real life had deus ex machina solutions . 
My mantra : \Shut up and deal . \"" 
Boy , not even awake for 10 minutes and the day has already gone straight to hell . 
I dun get how headsets break when all you do is wear them on your head ... One one but * both * of my headsets decided to die on me yesterday . I am not amused , being functionally a mute on XBL . 
Ramen at 6 AM for breakfast ? Yes . 
\Loneliness is a disease that causes death . For all purposes the two may as well be one of the same . \"" 
Just finished watching Spice and Wolf , now moving on to Wolf's Rain . 
has the sudden urge to play something Castlevania 
I love how hard it is to find a team who can actually do anything useful in BF : BC2 . Of course the games I get put in are on the less competent , losing side . I know why : teams who win stay together so no open spots for fresh players to join . Who wants to play the losing game ? So they leave the losing game . I hate this logic of matchmaking BF : BC2 has . It makes it impossible to find good people to play with . [/rant ] 
Your friends are like manuals . And you're a VCR . Sometimes only the really good ones know how to get you out of your blank , blinking stupor . 
\The author reserves the right to have a better idea . \"" 
One day there will be words here that will be full of important things to say . \ 
Today is not that day . 
Instant awesome , just add Stormtrooper . 
Rawr . I think Halo Wars is conspiring against me . Whenever I play as Cutter ( Infantry ) there's at least two Forge ( Tanks ) players on the other team and I'm screwed . Whenever I try someone other than Cutter , the game plays out in a way that I was better off with infantry in the first place . > : I 
sinus headache ! DX

Murphy's Military Law : If your attack is going well , it's an ambush . 
It's pretty bad when you get a Perfection ( 15+ kills with no deaths ) and you still lose . 
Apparently Legato's ( Trigun ) voice actor is the same guy who did Kenshin Himura . How's that for weird . 
I need to stop playing team games . It seems like no matter how well * I * do . I always seem to lose because of my \teammates\ " and their wonderful contributions to the team . " 
Since when does a Rouge decided to make his entrance by kicking down a door full of drunk and angry dwarfs ? 
You know you're a geek when you get into a serious conversation about fonts ... 
Every little thing , no matter what it is ... why ... Why must my < PROPFEMALE > always be tested ?

Double -edged swords , no matter how you wield them , eventually you're gonna get cut .

Who would win ? Vash or < PROPMALE > ? 
I built up all these walls , now I wish I could break them .

Sometimes , the best battle is the one you never took part in .

Gratuitous Japanese is gratuitous . I'm all for honorifics , but ffff , stop being such a stereotypical weeaboo . 
You don't deny the fact , yet you still don't answer the question . Either way , you look guilty . ;3 
In a world of an ' eye for an eye ' is a world that is blind . 
I would totally cosplay for Halloween . One problem ; I have no clue who ... X.x Ideas ? 
It's Sunday and I wake up at 6 AM on my own accord and can't fall back to sleep . Fffffff ... 
Why am I such a sucker for fluff ? 
If you are going to make a point of avoiding somebody , please don't make it obvious ... =__= #

I could be mean , selfish , and bitter . And yet , despite it all , I try my best not to be .

My computer died . X.x Using a different one , but it's a lot crappier , doesn't have my links and web pages , none of the programs I use , none of my music , and generally doesn't feel like my computer . Gonna see about getting my other one fixed . 
Gah ... I feel so lost without my usual bookmarks . X.x 
I need to do writing outside of RPs . Just made an awesome post to one , but I wish I could do something like that on my own . X.x

Guh .... Headache ... 
Ffff ... It's Sunday , why am I awake at 5:30 AM ? 
When all you have is a drill .... 
I forgot how awesome 30 Seconds to Mars is ... o.o 
Back from Wisconsin and Daisho Con and internet is back up . Got myself a Ghost in the Shell messenger bag , an FMA wall scroll , and a plush of < PROPMALE > . Good weekend was good . 
Nothing like hearing half a dozen sirens blaze in the distance ... 
I can feel inspiration on my fingertips , if only I could reach close enough to grab it . X.x

Let's be honest : People don't play CoD : Black Ops to play CoD : Black Ops ; they play it to play Nazi Zombies . 
I find it odd how , if I wasn't the one who starts the conversation , you'd never talk to me . 
I had a dream that I had a guitar with a grenade launcher ... I think I'm watching too much FLCL ...

To everyone freaking out the change in Astrology : The change affects only the Eastern , Sidereal Astrology . Which is based on the actual changing position of the stars . Here in the West , we use Tropical . Which is fixed , unchanging , based on the sky back during the first millennium . So unless you live in the East and/or use Sidereal over Tropical astrology ; stop freaking out . 
I swear if I had a dime for every person who is freaking out about their signs changing , I'd be a millionaire .

Did the Halo Reach : Weekly Challenge which is to complete ONI : Sword Base on Legenday with ALL SKULLS . Yes , even Iron ( Death resets checkpoint ) and Black Eye ( No shield recharge unless you melee ) . I think I died a little inside getting it done .
