This shit is really confusing ... 

Just got my new synthesizer yesterday , a Korg MS2000R . Man , this things rips . 
Totally made my boss kiss my ass last night . Prick . 
1 more night , then I'm off . [ yay ] 
off tonight . sweet . 
What to do tonight .... 
Work was so easy tonight .... kinda scary . Oh well , not complaining . Now , just have to figure out how to set up a music < PROPFEMALE > on facebook and I'll be set ... 
Can't sleep . Got too many things on my mind ... \ 
Damn I wish I had some beer ... 
I'm planning an epic bonfire for Monday or Tuesday night , any takers ? 
I <3 my new synth . 
I hate Father's Day ... 
Finally have time to record with all my new gear . Gonna be some good shit I think . 
Bought to make some tunes . Wish my mind would stop racing and relax . 
I'm in the middle of writing this awesome song , and I just discovered my computer recording input isn't working . FUCK !!! Just my luck , lol * bangs head on desk * 
My < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > just told me he had someone come through his drive through tonight and ask for a bean burrito with no beans ... lol 
Yes ! Found out how to fix my car , no more problems from it . One thing breaks , and one thing fixes itself . Funny how it always happens like that . 
\Life is really simple 
4:20 :) 
Work tonight . Yay ! [/sarcasm ] 
Man we get some weird people up here at < PROPMALE > world on third shift ... 
People are driving me nuts right now , wish everything didn't have to be so complicated . More roadblocks ahead for me , it seems ... 
So tired , about to pass out .... thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! lol 
< PROPFEMALE > Acid Christ : Best band ever . 
Finally slept . \ 
And now , to the coffeemaker ! haha . 
The ppl i feed wireless off of didn't pay the < PROPMALE > again ... shit ! 
My head hurts , this shit is getting too confusing ... gonna try to sleep now . At least im off tomorrow ! Take the good with the bad i guess . 
So boring at work tonight ... almost no one here and almost nothin to do . 
Time to record . After that , gonna run some errands and spend the day chillin ... then tonight , who the fuck knows . 
Rainin like a motherfucker out there ... holy crap . Almost got ran off the road by a semi , a Wal-Mart one much less . It's always the Wal-Mart guys driving like dumbasses ... 
Dude I am so bored . I hate being off work when no one wants to chill . 
Going to chill with my boy < PROPMALE > out in Starke . Gonna blaze up and hopefully record some good tracks . 
Happy 4th everyone . Time to blow some shit up ! 
About to try to teach myself a song on the keys . * cracks knuckles * 
Shit .... I always choose the tough ones . But I'm not givin up yet ! 
4th weekend was awesome . Had a lot of fun , saw some good people and recorded some good shit . \ 
Now , 6 days of work ahead , and then vacation . [ YES ! ]

obliteration/Crawl in your despiration/Crawl to annihilation\ 
\ 
[ VAC ] 
So\ 
somehow I got a friend request .... from myself . I do remember I \ 
actually had made a facebook years ago and never logged back in , and it \ 
looks like that's what it might be , and the only two friends on it are mine , and it is one of my real email addresses ..... \ 
.... but how I got a friend \ 
request from it is beyond me . \ 
It's like I'm stalking myself or \ 
something , yo . 
1 MORE MORE MOTHERFUCKIN DAY TO VACATION , THE SUSPENSE IS KILLIN ME ! \ 
Seriously , the most time I've had off since I started this job was 3 days ... wtf am I gonna do with 8 ? 
Ddddddude . I so don't wanna go back to work tomorrow . I need to go on vacation more often . 
Bought a mixer today . My studio setup is starting to look and sound SWEET . Had so much fun jamming with it today , I'm giddy like a schoolgirl ! [ gearfreak ] 
So . \ 
I recorded a song yesterday with my new shit . Rough version but it sounds pretty damn good . I posted it up on my myspace . \ 
www.myspace.com/reverendvile777 
Joy . Anger . Silence . \ 
Seems like the harder I try , the more fucked over I get . I give up . 
Life makes no sense to me sometimes . It's like everything around me is in a constantly random bipolar rotation for absolutely no reason . Or maybe I'm just crazy ... \ 
But anyways , last night was straight , off to go party with my stepdad today for awhile for his birthday and then who knows . Hit me up if ya feel like chillin this afternoon . \ 
[ Now Playing : Skinny Puppy - Stairs and Flowers ( Dub )]
