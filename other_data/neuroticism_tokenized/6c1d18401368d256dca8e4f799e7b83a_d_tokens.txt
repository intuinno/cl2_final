Has anyone noticed that in Super < PROPFIRST > Bros , there's this clip where it shows the Twin Towers start to disintegrate and a small plane flew through them , then disappeared . Its ironic , because that movie was developed & published in late 1985 .

RIP < PROPFIRST > Grey :( Your were a bad ass bassist !! You will be deeply missed . 
Dream what you want to dream , go where you want to go , \ 
be what you want to be . Because you have only one life and\ 
one < PROPMALE > to do all the things you want to do . 
Quote unquote . Whatever you do in life will be significant , but it's very important that you do it . Because nobody else will . 
I need a new camera , becuase mine is a broken piece of crap . I really need new pictures . Tired of having the same old ones .
