I may not have water again today , but I got a twinkie . So things aren't too bad . :) 
Come whatever may 
I'm in search of the original Taco Cat 
I want to move to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
Week #2's grades are in still kicking @** 
Rule #1 DoubleTap 
Turn off your mind , relax and float down stream It is not dying , It is not dying 
Who is that tap , tap , tapping . Is it that pesky < PROPFEMALE > again ? 
No matter where it leads , Life always takes me back to that fire pit 
there is beauty in darkness and hope in despair 
Help I am stuck in a loop ! Help I am stuck in a loop ! Help I am stuck in a ... 
Sexual Harassment Panda says , Touch me there once shame on you . Touch me there twice shame on me . 
Beware of the giant chorizo rabbit !! 
To my pillow , My dear sweet departed friend How I miss you . 
Little variations on my < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Little doors open on my cage \ 
Little time has come and gone so far \ 
Little by little who you are 
Each time a man lies he murders some part of the world . 
I was never good enough to find\ 
I was never bad enough to mind\ 
In the middle I will do my best\ 
Take me in your arms and leave the rest 
Go get your Sunday socks ! 
thinks the rain cleared all the gutters 
Open up the sun and burn my eyes\ 
Open up your arms and save my life\ 
I know I'll never go home again\ 
I need a little more but I will take what I can get\ 
I promise you everything ... everything\ 
Just don't forget me in the end 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
The American dream is a nightmare when it is built on the graves of decency and morality . 
Why do people have to destroy anything of beauty in this world ? 
Hell is where the heart is . Synapse again . 
The nature of people is variable , and whilst it is easy to persuade them , it is difficult fix them in that persuasion . 
\Oh pitiful shadow lost in the darkness 
I can remember ... dreamt them so vividly\ 
Soft creatures draped in white , light kisses gracing me\ 
I can remember when I first realized dreams were the only place to see them 
Shall we their fond pageant see ? \ 
Lord , what fools these mortals be ! 
Bruise one fragile ego and you end up hated . Oh well , at least the reason for my loss of sleep won't be this . :) 
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft\ 
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping 
We are the digital bohemians on a new frontier . 
Red light blinking , redd light blinking , AHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!! 
Through the glass , I see right through the rain\ 
Past distant memory , The mistakes I've made\ 
With no regrets , No fear remains\ 
So through the glass , I see right through the rain
