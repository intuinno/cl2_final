Hey Spanish , this is really hard for me to do , but I think that we need to break up ... I know we've had a love/hate relationship the past couple of years , and I guess I've just had enough . You're too difficult to understand for me , and frankly , I'm terrified of moving on to the next level with you . Unfortunately , today was our last day together .

Packers cut AJ Hawk ?! 
Officially doing our PR project on the Brewers ... I don't really want to be doing an 80 pg . project , but at least it's on something I love !

Dear Kentucky , thanks for losing ( BY ONE POINT ) and preventing me from winning $120 . I appreciate it . 
\frustrated\ " is a good word to describe me today . " 
is so grateful to have < PROPFEMALE > Bruecker in her life . Thank you for making me feel sane . 
oh , well ... that was THE LOUDEST LIGHTNING EVER . My ear infection thanks you , mother nature . 
I wish we still had < PROPFIRST > Inglett ... I think he'd be a better choice for a relief pitcher than our ACTUAL relief pitchers .
