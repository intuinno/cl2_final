Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ?

How will a professor react to this little comment ? I suppose time will tell . :) 
Left 4 Dead 2 for $7 ? Well , Steam , if you insist ... 
6 young men have committed suicide this week , bringing the total to 8 known gay bullying related suicides in the past 3 weeks . We , as a society , need to stand up and DO something about this . Suicide is not the answer , and we need to help make that clear and SUPPORT our LGBT youth ( and non-youth ) . Repost this if you give a damn .

Please repost this if you know or are related to someone killed on the second Death < PROPFEMALE > . People need to see that the Rebels are a band of terrorist scum . The Empire only wanted an active military defense for our great galaxy , but the Rebels blew it up and killed our Imperial troops and ... civilian contractors . The Rebels continue to use violence in support of peaceful ideology . 93% of people won't repost this . 
My phone will soon be dead and I have no viable way of charging it . If you want to reach me , Facebook or email me .

enjoyed the SigEp Haunted House . 
Please , \ 
Join me in putting this in your status if you or someone you love has been eaten by velociraptors . It's time to let silent victims everywhere know that there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for vicious sport . Velociraptors are , after all , kind of unstoppable . \ 
93% won't copy and paste this , but let's see that 7% that will . 
is once again paralyzed by thoughts of his future . God , this is getting annoying . 
Existential crisis go ! \ 
Right before I need to write a couple papers , too . Excellent . -_- 
Time for a walk . 
My walk , while enjoyable , did not offer any new insights . I'll try a different tactic : What do you , the denizens of Facebook , see me doing in the future ? I'll take anything from jokes to clichés to archetypes . I'm quite desperate for inspiration , so I'll take anything you can throw at me . 
Existential crisis averted everyone . Thanks for your support . =D \ 
Feel free to continue offering insights though . They are very much appreciated . =P 
Hm , I suppose this is a little late , but I now have a working phone ( I have for about half a week ) . I'm sure you already know this , I just wanted to make it official . Feel free to call or text me . :)

I miss my chocolate chip cookie . :( 
I'm home ! 
I finally beat the Baldur's Gate Trilogy ! It only took me about a decade . =D 
I want to play Kingdom Hearts . 
What a waste of a day ... -_- \ 
Is it Christmas break yet ? Please tell me it is . 
\Those who will never learn must not be allowed to take refuge in the freedom of opinion . \ " \ 
Two more paragraphs and a bibliography . I can do this ! 
C'est fini , enfin fini ! \ 
Now to print ... 
is attempting to eat some leftover steak with a butter knife and spoon . It's difficult . 
SNOW ! 
No more pumpkin muffins ... \ 
NOOO !!!! 
Amnesia : Dark Descent is absolutely terrifying . If you have Steam and $10 ( this weekend only ) to spend I would highly recommend it . \ 
I can't remember the last time I was this scared ... 
So begins the Great Monmouth Blizzard of Aught 10 . 
My name is < PROPFIRST > LeBlanc . You are papers . Prepare to be written .

Made the cast list for the Tempest ( < PROPFIRST > ) ! 
I hate the lighting in my room . Might as well be working by candlelight ... * grumbles * 
Friday night on duty . How am I spending it ? Robot Unicorn Attack followed by some D&D . Isn't college great ? :) 
Time for a walk , I think . 
\I will now take this opportunity to provide candid and clear answers to the questions that correspond to the course of my career . \ " \ 
is getting sicker . 
So it begins . \ 
Snow is already pouring down . Bring it on ! =D 
2/3 classes canceled . Here's hoping for the third ... 
hates how just one smidgen of lettuce can ruin an otherwise perfectly good sandwich . \ 
Oh well . :( 
I'm feeling rather wistful . It's not altogether unpleasant ... 
If your DAD was a hard working man , and is , and always will be your hero , helped you no matter how bad you were or was just the BEST DAD EVER , if you are blessed to still have your DAD or if he is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are PROUD of your DAD . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one DAD\ 
This is for you , < PROPMALE > Leblanc =D 
After countless unsuccessful attempts to download the Dragon Age II demo , I finally have it . I'm sure it won't disappoint . =D 
Dragon Age 2's advertising campaign is really beginning to irk me . This reeks of EA Games ' corporate meddling ... 
Braid for $3.00 ? I suppose so , Steam ... 
DLC announced on launch day ? Seriously , EA ? Seriously ? \ 
Maybe I won't purchase DA2 . Great job , EA . -_- 
Marooned in Monmouth with a dead car battery and no viable way of jumping it . Awesome . 
Back in Jerseyville until Sunday afternoon . 
Three hour drive + upset stomach = misery 
Thanks for the email update , Monmouth . Now my phone can't access my email account . -_- 
I hereby dedicate the rest of my semester to work , sleep , and food ( in that order ) . \ 
Farewell , Facebook . Perhaps we'll meet again someday . \ 
( No , I am not deactivating my account . I am just putting my life back in order . ) 
I am breaking my self-imposed Facebook exile to share this with you :\

Thank you ever so much for broadening my cultural horizons , < PROPMALE > Keist and < PROPFEMALE > Waldron . My wall has been graced with some real gems . -_- \ 
=P 
I am sick of combating irrationality . It's a losing battle , but yet I continue to fight it . \ 
* sigh * 
Is life worth living ? I think so , if only for the new experiences it brings . What about you , my fellow Facebookers ? What do you live for ? Why ? Humor me . Make a new experience with me . My life has been static for far too long . 
So stressed ... \ 
Is it summer yet ? 
Back in Jerseyville . Sadly , my time here will mostly be filled with reading and paper writing . 
It's raining , it's pouring ... \ 
Time for a nap . 
Finally , some inspiration ! Papers , you're going down . 
Life shouldn't be such a struggle . Why must it be so stressful ? \ 
Deep breaths . \ 
Italy in two weeks ... Italy in two weeks ... Italy in two weeks ... 
I may get eight hours of sleep tonight ?! Madness ! \ 
Luckily , I'm already partially insane . Good night Facebook . 
Alright . It's time . No more distractions . We will do battle , my papery friends , and I SHALL BE VICTORIOUS ! ONWARD !

Looks like I'm heading to Chicago tomorrow . 
Enjoying a lovely evening in Chicago . Shedd's Aquarium and Navy Pier will be the highlights of tomorrow's day . 
Super 8 was spectacular . I highly recommend it . 
Heading back to Jerseyville . Chicago was great ! 
Hey Monmouth folks : < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Owens < PROPMALE > Ziemer < PROPFIRST > Pika C < PROPFIRST > Ostrem < PROPFIRST > Slager Gabe Baginski\ 
Is anyone in possession of a Gamecube memory card with a sticker of Samus on it ? I can't find it even after turning my room upside down . If I could get it back , I would be very grateful . :) 
Watching Kiss Me < PROPFEMALE > at the Muny , the Muny in < PROPMALE > Park . 
I do believe the League of Legends server has been hacked . Tragic . 
I have Google+ account . PM/comment your email address if you want an invite . =D 
< PROPMALE > Potter midnight showing ? Yes please . :) 
Mischief managed . 
To the airport . Next stop , Tampa ( after a layover in < PROPFEMALE > , that is) !

Is it worth it , Facebook ? 
Settled in at Monmouth . I've got a good feeling about this year . 
Apparently , MyMC doesn't work on Chrome . Why am I not suprised ? -_- 
I think it's time for a walk . 
On duty in Peterson . Feel free to drop by and give me some company . No SODA for me tonight . :( 
I'm just not getting in to this whole Minecraft thingy ... 
What a beautiful night . Too bad homework is getting in the way of my evening walk ...

Don't forget that we are meeting at 1:00 pm in the Winbig lounge to make our characters . I will provide some character sheets ( I would prefer you to print your own ) and all the books that we will be using . \ 
Also : if someone could let < PROPFIRST > Lipinski know , I would be much obliged . 
It's finally beginning to feel like fall . I hope it lasts . 
I hate inheriting poorly annotated used text books . 
Time for a walk ? \ 
I think I feel an illness coming on ... \ 
:( 
Due to some not-so-subtle prodding from the lovely < PROPFIRST > E . Schuch , I now have a Twitter account : Secret_Schizoid . Follow me if you wish . 
I am who I am . It's time I make the best of it . No more ruminations . 
Disproving the Buddhist concept of anatman is hard . My brain hurts . 
Denizens of Facebook : Does anyone have a copy of the 1982 Gandhi film ? I've attempted to access it using several different means and each one has failed me . \ 
If you do , I would very much like to borrow it .
