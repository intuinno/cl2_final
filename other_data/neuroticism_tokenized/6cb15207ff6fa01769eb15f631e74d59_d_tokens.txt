well well well ive only been gone for a year so i couldnt really sum up whats on my mind 

well goodnight world for those of you that i havent said hi to yet i will talk to you tomorrow . Safe and Sound 
if you got one foot in the future and one foot in the past then your pissin ' on the present . 
realease yourself from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our mind 
release yourself from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds 
People change , Things go wrong , Shit happens , but LIFE GOES ON !! 
Courage does not always roar . Sometimes it is the quiet voice at the day , saying , “I will try again tomorrow” . 
i been thru it all , the fails the falls , im like niagra but i got right back up like viagra 
And if you come up from under that water and there's fresh air , just breathe baby , God's got a blessin ' to spare . I know the process is so much stress but it's the progress that feels the best . I came from the projects straight to success and you're next , just try , they can't steal your pride , it's inside . Then find it and keep on grindin ' ' cause in every dark cloud theres a silver linin- lil ' < PROPMALE > 
people talk shit , but when shit hits the fan everything I'm not , made me everything I am 
Hope you ain't too tired to cry , and I hope you know you ain't never too alive to die . 
“People are afraid of themselves , of their own reality ; their feelings most of all . People talk about how great love is , but that's bullshit . Love hurts . Feelings are disturbing . People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous . How can they deal with love if they're afraid to feel ? Pain is meant to wake us up . People try to hide their pain . But they're wrong . Pain is something to carry . \ " , 201 0-0 1-14 22:37:38 "

I just want to sleep in like a normal human being 
Sleep with all the lights on . \ 
You're not so happy . \ 
You're not secure . \ 
You're dying to look cute in your blue jeans , \ 
but you're plastic just like everyone . \ 
You're just like everyone . \ 
And that face you paint is pressed \ 
impressing most of us as permanent\ 
and I'd like to see you undone . \ 
College night will draw the crowds . \ 
Dorms unload & your heading out . \ 
Here is your moment to shine . 
So kiss me hard ' cause this will be the last time that I let you\ 
You will be back someday and this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service to giving you away\ 
I heard about your regrets\ 
I heard that you were feeling sorry\ 
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us\ 
Well I guess I should have heard of that from you\ 
I guess I should have heard of that from you

She had a history of killing herself \ 
I had a habit of dying \ 
I think she gave me something to live for \ 
I guess I helped her pass the time \ 
And I had a vision of seeing things straight \ 
She had the heart of a liar \ 
I never saw her leave me once \ 
She never felt me beside her 
Well I don't know but I've been told , you never slow down , you never grow old . \ 
I'm tired of screwin ' up , tired of goin ' down , \ 
Tired of myself , tired of this town , \

December is FINALLY here . And FINALLY starting to get some direction in life . 
A pessimist is a man who thinks all women are bad . An optimist is a man who hopes they are\ 
The man's < PROPFEMALE > is for the woman ; but the woman's < PROPFEMALE > is rarely other than for the < PROPFEMALE > of the man . \ 
Could decide between the two so I put both \

Oh what a night late December back in two thousand ten :) 
' Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the house , Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ; The stockings were < PROPMALE > by the chimney with care , In hopes that St. < PROPMALE > soon would be there ; The children were nestled all snug in their beds , While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ; And mamma in her ' kerchief , and I in my cap , Had just settled down for a long winter's nap . 
Can't sleep here in Alabama , 17 years old and still excited for Xmas . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all . I hope everyone got what they wanted . I know I sure did . I'm so grateful . 
Last day in bama :/
