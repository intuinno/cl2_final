It has been a riveting six weeks , but it looks like it's time to take another crack at this college thing . To my friends in NH , I salute you all . You are a diverse and honest group of people and I very much hate to be leaving again so soon . 

I could be wrong , but I think my college just offered me full tuition ?!? ( wait for confirmation , I need to talk to somebody who understands financial talk ) 
Afraid for my sanity . Watched \El Topo\ " . Felt I actually understood what was taking place before my eyes . " 
My brother returns . With a vengeance .

The first question I ask myself when something doesn't seem to be beautiful is why do I think it's not beautiful . And very shortly you discover that there is no reason . \

“Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people , for with others , even with lovers sometimes , we suffer from our differences ... With other human beings , vision becomes double vision . We are busy wondering , “what does my companion see or think of this ? ” And “what do I think of this ? ” The original impact is lost , or diffused . \ -May Sarton " 
There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time . There is always something to see , something to hear . In fact , try as we may to make a silence , we cannot . \ 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a helping hand 
will be canoeing the Allagash River for the next six days . 
A couple of unrelated quotes\ 
“Man is the only animal for whom his own existence is a problem which he has to solve”\

I love sleep . My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake , you know ? \ 
< PROPMALE > Hemingway 
Words stand between silence and silence : between the silence of things and the silence of our own being . Between the silence of the world and the silence of God . When we have really met and known the world in silence , words do not separate us from the world nor from other men , nor from God , nor from ourselves because we no longer trust entirely in language to contain reality . -Thomas Merton

But it was only fantasy . \

One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever came to sit by it . Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on their way . - < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Gogh 
Love many things , for therein lies the true strength , and whosoever loves much performs much , and can accomplish much , and what is done in love is done well . - < PROPFIRST > Gogh 
I can very well do without God both in my life and in my painting , but I cannot , suffering as I am , do without something which is greater than I am , which is my life , the power to create . - < PROPFIRST > Gogh 
Better a cruel truth than a comfortable delusion . 
just put way too much effort into a single essay that was due a month ago , but is proud of the final product , nonetheless . 
We need not destroy the past . It is gone . 
If a writer knows enough about what he is writing about , he may omit things that he knows . The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water . \ 
... we must tell lies to each other and especially to ourselves . The lies are necessary because , without them , many deplorable acts would become impossibilities . 
Lunar eclipse monday night . Last one until 2014 . The world could be over by then ... If not , I'll be graduating from college . Point is , my eyes will be on the < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I want to make it very clear , to reaffirm ... that my quietness does not stem from some form of arrogance , some antisocial impulse ... not even shyness . That isn’t it . This silence does not reflect any distaste for your company , any disinterest in your lives , your aspirations , your struggles ... 
threatened by shadows at night ... and exposed in the light ...

Every man's life ends the same way . It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another . \ 
If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason , then all possibility of life is destroyed . \ 
* < PROPFIRST > Tolstoy 
Such beautiful , necessary things , these contradictions , these inconsistencies and discrepancies and deviations which give this world it’s texture- these rough places which make one moan and bleed . 
\Civilized Man says : \ 
\The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed . \ " ~ < PROPMALE > Biko " 
Modern man likes to pretend that his thinking is wide awake . But this wide awake thinking has led us into the mazes of a nightmare in which the torture chambers are endlessly repeated in the mirrors of reason ... perhaps we will realize that we have been dreaming with our eyes open , and that the dreams of reason are intolerable . And then , perhaps , we will begin to dream once more with our eyes closed . \

\In this country people are rarely imprisoned for their ideas because they're already imprisoned by their ideas . \ " \ 
flash drive effectively destroyed . so much old writing and notes lost ... like losing my journal and or mind all over again . All is well . Guess I should just let go . Shouldn't need records to remind me of what I was , am , and would like to become . 
One cannot be deeply responsive to the world without being saddened very often . 
The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places . But those that will not break it kills . It kills the very good , and the very gentle , and the very brave impartially . If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too , but there will be no special hurry . \ 
Hemingway 
One tends to put a lot of weight in friendship , and in relationships of every form , and to choose ones words with care , when one understands that \bye\ " and \ " see ya\ " do not guarantee a nearby \ " hello\ " . Do not guarantee another meeting at all . \

Goodbye COA . You've been far kinder to me than I deserve . 
To do : see my brothers . Biological and otherwise . 
“A human being should be able to change a diaper , plan an invasion , butcher a hog , conn a ship , design a building , write a sonnet , balance accounts , build a wall , set a bone , comfort the dying , take orders , give orders , cooperate , act alone , solve equations , analyze a new problem , pitch manure ... cook a tasty meal , fight efficiently , die gallantly . Specialization is for insects . ”\ 
- < PROPFIRST > A . Heinlein 
Try as He might to hurt me He cannot now . His misery is His own and He fears what I have found in myself . He fears this new strength . My ability to stand in places of pure animal joy unaffected by the comfortable insanities he is so invested in maintaining . 
Forget a job . First I've got to find a place to live . A place to sleep and breath and think and to sit in quiet in preperation for the coming storm .

Who was born in a house full of pain\ 
Who was trained not to spit in the fan\ 
Who was told what to do by the man\ 
Who was broken by trained personnel\

Who was given a < PROPFIRST > on the back\ 
Who was breaking away from the pack\ 
Who was only a stranger at home\ 
Who was ground down in the end\ 
Who was found dead on the phone\

Think of our life in nature , —daily to be shown matter , to come in contact with it , —rocks , trees , wind on our cheeks ! The solid earth ! the actual world ! the common sense ! Contact ! Contact ! Who are we ? where are we ? * Thoreau 
~ All I see turns to brown \ 
As the sun burns the ground . \ 
And my eyes fill with sand \ 
As I scan this wasted land ... ~ 
we do not know joy ... our world has been diminished to grays and reds and blues ... to dull tedium and the poignancy of suffering and of tragedy ... no longer able to feel happiness and the true securiity of family , but only toxic mimics of these things ... he exerts himself in the pursuit of sharper reds and blues , if only to give the world color even in the absence of the yellows and oranges and greens . 
\I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful . I am no longer sure of myself 
\As we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult 
If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day , he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer . But if he spends his days as a speculator , shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time , he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Thoreau 
\We were not meant for this . We were meant to live and love and play and work and even hate more simply and directly . It is only through outrageous violence that we come to see this absurdity as normal
