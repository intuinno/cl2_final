Watching the Mosley vs Mayweather fight 
Aside from round 2 ... this fight was pretty boring . Completly one sided 
Had a GREAT weekend trip to Fort < PROPMALE > Beach Fl . < PROPMALE > out with some really good friends , watched my son have a blast in the sand and water , drank lots of beachy drinks , ate way too much and got just a little sun burnt . ALL IN ALL ... worth every < PROPFEMALE > 
Is floored that the Penguins lost to the Canadians at home ... game 7 . That is BS 
is preparing to fight the \MAN\ " .. Got my answer yesterday about my Air Force medical board . medical discharge .. I want to stay in so let the fight begin . Next step is a formal board review in Texas . Worse that can happen is they tell me no again . " 
Glad for the weekend ... needed after the past couple weeks . Last week my beloved grandfather past , and now this week the Air Force has deemed me medically unfit to stay in . Weekend ... I love you . 
Ugh ... tired .

Lazy Sunday . 
Apolitician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension is not reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expense account ; a soldier must justify extra ... rations . A politician vows to defend ... their country ; a soldier actuallykeeps that promise . REPOST IF YOU SUPPORT OUR TROOPS
