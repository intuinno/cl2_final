HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!! 

I PASSED CHEMISTRY !! \ 
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT !!!! 
I had this weird nightmare last night , where I was a network administrator for a group of computers in an office . Some kid had changed the themes and was running games on them , and I had to quit and delete the games and change the themes back to normal . Sounds like something I would do ... 
Feeling trapped in my computer . 
Arrrggg !!!! They Changed Facebook AGAIN !!!!!!! Of course , none of the changes are good ! If it ain't broke DON'T FIX IT > ( 
Has anyone figured out how to get your facebook groups back ? \ 
\ 
The groups apparently still exist , but none of mine are on my info < PROPFEMALE > . 
Class of 2010 has * officially * left the High School ! 
Well ... my Mom and brothers left for the states today , and my Dad is still deployed . \ 
I am all alone !! :| 
My Dad and I are packing out tommorow ! 
Another day , another * nickel* ! 
We are out of Germany and staying in a hotel in florida for a night , then going up to Pennsylvania to see grandparents . 
Waitin ' in the tampa airport ... using their FREE WIFI ! \ 
It's AWESOME !!! 
WHAT IS WITH ALL THESE PHANTOM WALL POSTS ?!!??!?!?!??! \ 
I will see in my notifications that someone posted something , but then when I try to read it , Facebook says it isn't available anymore . \ 
???????????? 
Yugch ... I lined my arteries today ... \ 
Had to wolf down a cheeseburger to hurry to freshman photo . \ 
Hope I don't have to do that again ! 
I tried to send feedback to the new Internet Explorer 9 beta ... \ 
What a mess ! \ 
I had to get all sorts of accounts to get it to work , after i finally found it . \ 
I finally was able to send my feedback ... \ 
And they just restated what I already knew . \ 
Basically my input was \your program does ' A ' 
I had mexican coca-cola yesterday . \ 
Tastes just like the < PROPMALE > coke . \ 
mmmmmm ... 
I can't believe all of these people who think that High Fructose Corn Syrup and real sugar are the same thing . THEY ARE MOST CERTAINLY NOT !!!! \ 
For starters , on HFCS , I loose control of my behavior ; while sugar does not have this effect . Time and again I have proven this to be true . \ 
Plus , sugar just tastes better . HFCS is unhealthy and unpalatable . BURN IT !! 
It's Snowing sideways O_o 
ITS SET YOUR DESKTOP BACKGROUND TO A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION DAY !!!!!!!!!! 
Goodbye cedarville ! see you guys January ! 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS !!!!!!!!! 
I just used the absolute silliest-most pointless Facebook app ever\ 
All it does is take your name and give you a randomized list of three words that best describe you . At first I thought it read your info < PROPFEMALE > , but I figured out it was random when I took it a second time and got completely different results . Why do people even do those ones-they don't even ask any questions ! \ 
Oh well . Silly world , silly people .
