Life's not too bad out here , boring but that's about it . I miss everyone back home , especially < PROPFEMALE > ( I love you ) . Here's my email out here robert.macken@afg.usmc.mil email me sometime ... 

Life is grand , I can't complain too much right now . 
Yep , it's official I'm completely heels over head in love with my wife :) 
It's amazing how the right person in your life can turn everything around . She makes every day better and every night a little more comfortable . 
Days go by so slow ... Weeks crawl ... Months go fast .... I wish time would pick a constant speed out here . Preferably the fastest one possible . 
The Theory of Deployment Relativity : ( n ); A theory describing how , as the end of the deployment nears , time , as perceived by the participant , appears to slow . 
120+ temperatures , random dust storms that make noon look like twilight , insanely large spiders , mud brick housing , 1 < PROPMALE > paved road , luxurious accommodations in a 100 man tent with no A/C , sleeping on a government cot , 12+ hour workdays .... I really don't understand - why isn't Afghanistan on anyone's \Top Ten Places to visit before I Die\ " list ? " 
Standing on the corner in winslow arizona ... Too bad it is because of a car accident . 
Punching annoying little kids = HILARIOUS !! 
So ... Just realized that the song < PROPFEMALE > was about a transvestite ... I'm concerned as to how it took me this long to figure it out . It's such a catchy song though I still like it . 
< PROPFEMALE > badger don't care .... < PROPFEMALE > badger dont give a shit !
