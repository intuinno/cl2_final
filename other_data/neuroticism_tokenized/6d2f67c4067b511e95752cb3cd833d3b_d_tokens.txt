First day for < PROPFIRST > too , he is so happy ! 

I do not know who they got to drive the summer school buses . We live on 34th and 35th has a divider down the middle of it , so the bus was going up one side of 35th and down the other side thinking it was 34th ! < PROPFIRST > is taking < PROPFIRST > to school today and then h 
Just watched \Up\ " with < PROPFEMALE > . What a great movie and what a treat to watch it with my sweet girl ! " 
< PROPFIRST > was watching an old video of the Fourth of July that was taken 20 some years ago and my daughter < PROPFEMALE > was in it . It's been so long since I have seen her and the sense of loss was so overwhelming that I cried most of the day . 
< PROPFIRST > went to the big Holiday dance today . He wanted to dress up and \not wear anything boring\ " so he wore a charcoal gray 3 piece suit and a red shirt and tie . He was just too handsome for words ! " 
The holidays always make me sad . I miss all the people I love who aren't here , the loss seems so fresh at Christmas time . 
What a beautiful morning , the sun is shinning and the birds are singing , the neighbors dog is barking , feels a lot like spring ! 
It's been a rough week . < PROPFEMALE > has been so sick , she got an ear infection that got really bad super fast . Type 1 diabetes makes everything so much worse . 
< PROPFIRST > made sausage waffles for breakfast this morning yummmy !! 
It was an emotionally exausting day . Can't wait for < PROPFIRST > to come home so we can have a drink and talk . 
In honor of the day , an < PROPFEMALE > quote : God is good but never dance in a small boat 
People need to understand that special needs children don't have an illness . They aren't looking for a cure , only acceptance . 93% of you probably won't copy and past this to your status-will you be in the 7% who does ? Special education week March 22 to the 26th . 
What a wonderful day to be alive , the universe has had some great messages for me lately 
\Everybody can be great because anybody can serve . You don't have to have a college degree to serve . You don't need to make your subject and verb agree to serve . You only need a heart full of grace . A soul generated by love . \ " < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
\There's no reason to let Mommies glass go empty after a day like today . \ " < PROPFIRST > Hawley " 
\We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them\ " Einstein " 
\The spiritual meaning of love is measured by what it can do . Love is meant to heal . Love is meant to renew . Love is meant to bring us closer to God . \"" 
The most powerful ties are the ones to our children , it hardly seems to matter how many years have passed , how many betrayals there may have been , how much misery in the family : We remain connected , even against our wills . 
\Tears are words the heart can't express \"" 
First time I have been able to get on facebook in over a week . Anyone know what is going on with the system ? 
\Marriage is 3 parts love and 7 parts forgiveness of sins\ " \ 
\Tears are words the heart can not express . \"" 
\There are few things as seemingly untouched by the real world as a child asleep\ " < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > " 
Got the lawn mowed on this beautiful day ... could summer have arrived at last ? 
\We achieve inner health only through forgiveness - the forgiveness not only of others but also of ourselves\ " \ 
\Expectation is the root of all heartache\ " \ 
\There are some among us who live in rooms of experience we can never enter\ " \ 
\Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle 
A friend suggested that I read Confucius so I thought I would share some quotes that spoke to me . \It is better to play than do nothing\ " Confucius " 
Every year since diagnosis we have sent < PROPFEMALE > to diabetic camp in the summer & this is the week . It's staffed by Drs . & everyone there has diabetes . It's hard to face the fact that you have an incurable disease which will effect every moment of the rest of your life and then kill you especially when you are just a kid . So now she is where everyone wears an insulin pump and has to poke their finger at 2 AM ! 
\The superior man knows what is right 
< PROPFEMALE > is at summer camp , < PROPFIRST > is at work , and < PROPFIRST > just got on the bus for summer school so I am blissfully alone for a couple of hours . Alone ... just love it . 
Just back from picking up < PROPFEMALE > at camp . It's up north on the Pend Oreille River so it's a real pretty drive , glad to have my baby back but not as happy as her puppy ! 
I think my brain is going to explode 
\To be wronged is nothing enless you continue to remember it . \ " Confucius " 
\Anger is natural . It's part of the force . You just have to learn to < PROPFEMALE > out with it . \ " < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
23 days till school starts ..... WOO HOO !!! 
22 days till school starts ... the countdown is ON ! 
\Reality is the leading cause of stress amongst those in touch with it . \ " < PROPFEMALE > Tomlin " 
\Too often we ... enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought\ " < PROPFIRST > F Kennedy " 
Today is our 20th anniversary . While there have been many challenges we are still facing them together . Happy Anniversary < PROPFIRST > , I love you ! 
It is a new day my friends 
\May the stars < PROPFEMALE > your sadness away . May the flowers fill your heart with beauty . And may hope forever wipe away your tears . \ " Chief < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
\What is life ? It is the flash of a firefly in the night . It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime . It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and looses itself in the sunset . \ " Blackfoot quote " 
Caught a cold 2 days ago and by today had full blown pnemonia , some people just like to do things in a big way 
I go back to the Dr. on Monday , I am so sick of being sick . All I do is cough and wheeze and get nothing done . I feel like it's been forever since I've been outside . 
HELP I'm being held captive in a snowglobe and someone keeps shaking it 
Well , I guess it was bound to happen .... hit a pothole and ruined one of my fancy snow tires . It didn't seem like a big deal till I was stranded . < PROPFIRST > came and put my spare on then got me a brand new tire .... my hero ! 
Had my echocardiogram this morning , now I have to wear a heart monitor till tomorrow . 
< PROPFIRST > has been sick all week end , we spent Saturday and Sunday nights in the ER . Sure hope he gets better soon !
