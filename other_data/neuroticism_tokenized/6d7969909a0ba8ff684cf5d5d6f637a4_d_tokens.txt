Tpiñg 2010 Success !! 
Last night was one of the most fun nights I have had in awhile with my best friends < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > ! 
jackass 3d , funniest movie i have seen in a long time ! 
What an election night . Congrats to < PROPFIRST > Branstad for beating culver and winning the race for iowa governor again . Now even though republicans don't have senate control , they got back control of the house , which means no < PROPFEMALE > pelosi as speaker ! So a good night for the republicans , which only makes us closer to stopping policies of obama ! 
Democrats held a vote yesterday to raise taxes on small businesses , adding to the uncertainty that’s gripped American employers . A Democrat tax hike would join other job-killing policies like ObamaCare & Washington’s spending spree as another barrier to job growth . We need to stop all the tax hikes & cut spending to help create jobs , & if the lame-duck Congress won’t do it , the new House Majority will in January . 
loving the new lap top ! 
goodbye 111th united states congress ! never going to miss the most corrupt congress in history . hopefully the 112th congress can get us down the right path again . wishing speaker elect boehner and the newly elected representatives and senators the best . 
looking forward to turning 18 in 5 days . 
go steelers ! 
go steelers ! hoping for super bowl win number 7 ! 
Happy 100th Birthday President < PROPFEMALE > , we will never forget you ! 
long night at the store . time to relax for the rest of the weekend . 
got a $300 scholarship for college ! not much but better than nothing at all .
