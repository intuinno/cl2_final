Woot ! Air Show in < PROPFEMALE > tonight and tomorrow ! See everyone there ! 

Work , work , work . I love the 4th of July . 
I usually love the rain but not when I want to be out celebrating . 
Grrrr . Stupid server ! 
Ahhh . Finally home . 
What's on my mind ? Nothing ! Surprising ? Probably not . Ohh something shiney ! 
Can't wait to get home and spend some time with the family . 
doh left my ipod at work and no it looks like im on for chat and im not 
What the heck are you doing ?! 
Why does my love for gaming ( and I'm not talking about casual gaming like Farmville or any other FB game ) and my love for the outdoors always seem to collide ? :( 
I was sad when I learned the American Dream is greed . 
Thanks guys ! :)

* peeks over the fence * Howdy-ho neighbor . 
VOTE NO ON SQ 754 ! Because voting yes means you are giving away your right and all future Oklahoman's right to ever vote on the issue again . If you pass it you can't go back and change your mind . That just seems down right unAmerican to me . As an American I have the right to vote and I do not think anyone should be able to take that right away . 
So get a call at the office today and a co-worker tells me its my wife so I answer . Luckily only saying hey . Then a guy proceeds to ask for my boss . I am wonder what is going on . I look at the caller ID and it says < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and they guy tells me his name about the same time . I thought it was funny and only awkward because I was expecting to be talking to my wife . 
12% nerf to warlocks almost across the board ! The nerf mallet hurts so bad ! 
Must get sleep ! 
Was thinking Ren and Stimpy but they are a bit violent and I think that defeats the purpose so Rocko it is . 
:( only about 3 hrs sleep and stopped breathing during that ... I'm so tired . 
=(
