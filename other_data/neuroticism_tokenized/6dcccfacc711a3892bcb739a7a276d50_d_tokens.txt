Watched Shark Boy and Lava Girl . Man I love that movie ... 

I took the Disney < PROPFEMALE > quiz and got < PROPFEMALE > . Weird , cuz I've admired her since I was little ... 
I PARTYED WITH THE JOBROS AND HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE !!! :D 
I didn't know seeing < PROPFEMALE > today would make me so happy ! :D 
... my mom just added me as a friend . That's cool yet akward at once . I'm finally feeling the age of 18 ... Happy Birthday Ash ! 
My own mother goes on my college's facebook in search of Indian friends for me . I'm 18 and she still enjoys setting up play dates . If you saw me , I'm rolling my eyes as I begin mega-facepalming . 
Just met my friends at CSU ... it was fun :D 
I'm stalling from reading philosophy ... I'm such a bad student ... 
wow . didnt know making a list of things that make me happy was so hard ! 
Diwali ... its the great holiday to pray and eat sweets . Happy Diwali ! 
Sooo .... I learned that i'm a G cuz when a random kid was marching around my hood , I wanted to beat him up :O 
i'm pretending to be doing my hw ... shhhh ... 
crunchy pie 
Learned with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > that green M&Ms have viagra and red ones agive cancer ... that's the last time i'm using < PROPFEMALE > as comfort food ! 
Actions speak louder than words ... but it also helps if you walk around with a sign saying \PARANOID\ " on your forehead " 
Christmas is coming ... but i still have Thanksgiving leftovers 
You can only feel the emotions I do now when you finish a well-dreaded term paper ... i think i'm gonna cry ...

I know i didnt get to tell alot of people , but HAPPY NEW YEAR !! Here's to a bright year filled with happiness and love for all . Cheers :) 
I went ot Savemart in my pjs and a sweater , and ate pancakes when i came home . HAPPY DAY !! 
Saddest thing : my choclate cake creation is half gone and I have no idea what it tastes like ... 
Never ask ' why , ' ask ' why not ? ' 
Hurt my lower back while packing boxes . But dont fret , my wonderful companions : I WILL RECOVER !! :D 
I saw a car with a bumper sticker reading \Republican for Voldemort . \ " Will I respond to that ? Hell yeah i will : \ " Democratic for Moldybutt . \""

Most romantic-yet-disturbing line : My love for you is like leg hair , it grows 2 centimeters every morning . 
I love how me and < PROPFIRST > are on our computers , but she's actually DOING her hw :O 
They have a < PROPMALE > Potter day , and it's the hilight of my visit on Facebook for today :D 
Learned about Hitler in history , had a great workout , then talked about < PROPFEMALE > Palin , Twilight , < PROPFEMALE > , Tiger Woods , and < PROPFIRST > Phelps in English . < PROPFIRST > was right , < PROPFEMALE > and I are very simplisticc indeed :D 
I get to write my SCRIPT !! The catch : it has to be a dialogue and there can only be 10 lines per character ... I must think this through again 
It's officially over . The house is officially open . I have officially cleaned it till it sparkled . i am officially sick of being sick . And I offically want Mcky D's . Meeting adjourned . 
... We need stronger rings 
I was walking home and a random , yet cute dog followed me . The only way to get rid of it : ditching it in the middle of a fetch game . God , forgive me . 
Being like Yoda I am 
Certain as the sun Rising in the east Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast <3 
I need a hero\ 
Save me now\ 
I need a hero to save me\ 
Just in time 
Starry night last night , then the beautiful rain today . No wonder I'm feeling so much better <3

USA and England tied now . This game literally has me on edge now 
Saw Karate Kid . It hyped my lil cousin to wanna learn how to fight ... And she's 4 . 
World Cup is finally on !! I actually had the tv on all day for this . 
Paraguay scored and it looked like their coach was fist pumping . Jersey Shore International . 
Ok , so Paraguay's goalie left me speechless , Italy has good offense ... I'd say this game was worth me falling-off-the-couch-cuz-i-go t-t oo-into-it . 
I think Christiano Ronando was being purposefully tripped throughout the game . I've never seen him fall so much in a SEASON ... 
I was feeling so sick last night , and I still can't eat today . It's a consparicy against me I know it !! 
Wow , a week away from Facebook and I might as well as have closed my eyes to the entire world ! 
I love how all day I thought it was going to be deathly hot , but as soon as I walked outside , it rained for half a minute 
Boomers was so much fun , I got SOAKED !! 
My title for the day was Sensei Ash :D

Dance crazes . The reason Ashwini Dhillon , < PROPFIRST > Maderr , and I own video cameras and iPods . 
Omg , thank goodness no one is in the room below us ! We've been jumping around all afternoon/night 
School starts next week . I need to pack my week of laziness into the next 3 days 
Drinking a glass of milk to test my intolerance . Not one of my brightest ideas , but it's mandatory . 
So bored , I'm already reading and memorizing terms from my biochem book . And school hasn't started yet . 
I still managed to gain weight on the day I ate so little . DARN YOU , OREOS !!

Eggs : 1\ 
Stupid egg recall 
With Wini and Shel during our another one of our nonstop conversations 
Where did my summer go !!?

School was really good . So nice to see everyone today , and make new friends :D 
I love \No comprehensive final\ " classes :) "

Trying to do my report on the pastor on the news , but I cant find the freakin ORIGINAL video !! C'mon Google ... I want the ORIGINAL video , not the INTERVIEW videos !! 
Writing my speech like the good little college student that I am ... 
Dear school , \ 
With your witty little ways , you always know what will push me on the edge . Thank you for not making me go completely insane . We both know that can lead to world domination and/or destruction . \ 
I love you . But STOP KILLING ME !! \

Today is one of THOSE days . Where you want everything up front , nothing sugar-coated . 
People ... BE NICE TO ME !! 
If I touch a burning candle , i feel no pain\ 
In the ice or in the sun , its all the same\ 
And I know my heart is aching\ 
Though it doesnt beat , its breaking\ 
And the pain here that I feel , \ 
Try and tell me its not real , \ 
And I know that I am dead , \ 
But it seems I still have some tears to shed <3 
I was happily thinking I was done for the night ... \ 
Then remembered my biochem teacher gives pop quizzes for her amusement\ 
A genuine FML moment

Dear Facebook , \ 
I don't know what to say . I just want to post something and feel special cuz everyone who is or will be online can see it . And hopefully someone will like it . Cuz that's all we want , is to be heard . 
When everything falls apart your arms hold me together\ 
When everything falls apart you're the only hope for this heart\ 
When everything falls apart and my strength is gone\ 
I find you mighty and strong , you keep holding on\ 
You keep holding on 
Ive learned i cant be in the same room as the fax machine . Those buttons are just so tempting ... 
I love those store-runs that have a consistant theme . Today's theme : fruit juices 
\I was just thinking -\" \ 
Left my fear by the side of the road\ 
Hear you speak\ 
Wont let go\ 
Fall to my knees as i lift my hands to pray ... 
I shouldnt be allowed to watch the news . It inspires me to parachute out airplanes and go on treasure hunts 
if this dream dictionary is correct , we're all hormonally driven dogs 
Its a nice morning . Yeah im tired and sore , but i gots < PROPFEMALE > keeping me entertained :D 
Ok , so I heard this weird sound right ? and i thought \oh

At the mall pretending to be looking at shoes when im really watching Pokemon on an iPad over a 2 yr olds shoulder 
Solve this :\ 
9x-7i > 3(3x-7u ) 
I hate to see you cry\ 
Your smile is a beautiful lie\ 
My love is dying inside\ 
I can fix all those lies\ 
But baby , baby I run , but I'm running to you\ 
You won't see me cry , I'm hiding inside\ 
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you\

< PROPFIRST > : I know where boogers come from !! 
My secret ? I like to pretend I'm as smart as my grandma and eye every ingredient when i cook instead of actually measuring it out <3 
Stupid chest . Make that hollow feeling go away :\\

MY FAVORITE with < PROPFIRST > Ornelas\ 
< PROPFIRST > : It takes two to tango . Cuz when one is tangoing then it takes the other to know what to do to actually tango . \ 
Me : No ! What about when you grab my hand and pull me forward then back and twirl me !!? That's us dancing but I don't know what I'm doing !!
