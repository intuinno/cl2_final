Put this in your status if you know or love somebody that is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice-people who are gay are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% of you won't copy and paste this . Will you make ... this your status for at least one hour ? Promote love and acceptance NOT HATE
