Dear < PROPFIRST > , The Office of Admissions at Appalachin is pleased to inform you of your admission to the freshman class beginning in the Fall Semester 2010 
so over the course of the last 2 days ive managed to get like 98% of the bondo down on my hood and it mostly sanded down smooth ... its gonna take a hell of alot more time and effort to make it perfect and ready to prime though ... on another note - i made gravy for dinner today for the first time , and it was pretty good :D 2nd time around anyways .. 
this is great .... [ not me ] Today , while trying to pull a nail out of some wood with a crowbar in my theatre class , my girlfriend , who was holding down the wood with her foot , thought it would be funny to move her foot and make me lose my balance . Instead , the crowbar flew up and struck me in the nuts . FML 
dennys for a big breakfast in the morning with < PROPFIRST > Markham then giving blood at 10:00 at the school blood drive 
so after giving blood as i went about my day i got progressively more tired ... resorted to laying out on our tarp during a break in practice for a few mins but it was quite uncomfortable ; oh well , thats what you get for giving blood , but hey , i did just fine this time :) 
traffic court case got cleared :D
