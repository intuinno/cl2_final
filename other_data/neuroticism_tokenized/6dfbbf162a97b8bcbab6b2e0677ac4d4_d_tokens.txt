Ok , I'm addicted to Zoo World ... X_x need to do laundry and finished dishes AND take shower before dad gets home !!! D: Well , at least the dishes and shower o-o 
LMAO ! XD I went to clean the headers in my VCR with the cleaning tape ( because I'm getting a wide line of discoloration at the top of the screen with any tape I use ) and someone had recorded on it ! So now I gotta wait for dad to find the other one XP .

Last week of Spring/Summer classes for me ! :D YAY 
Off to < PROPFEMALE > for Calc 2 ... yay , more headaches X_x 
Woo ! Home with brains intact :D 
Gah , this is the first time I've woken up with cramps in a LONG time . I woke up stuttering \I-is this ... \ " in varying forms in my mind from a mixture of shock and incoherency ( from waking up abruptly ) and stumbled towards the bathroom . So far it looks like it's just a really bad case of gas o-o I should prolly go downstairs and eat something though ... " 
About three days ago , I started listening to an audiobook reading of P . C . Cast's Elphemera's Choice , which has some interesting concepts , but clashes with my writer's sense on how far one should stretch reality . There are quite a few points I end up shaking my head in irritation on how forced much of it seems . 
Yesterday I ran across < PROPFIRST > Armstrong's Awakening , the second in the Darkest Powers trilogy . At first I was a bit leery , because I wasn't sure if this book was the continuation of another series similar to it ( Dark Visions by L . J . Smith ) I had put down because the characters had become too \important\ " . To my delight it wasn't that book and I found Awakening hard to put down . " 
Just applied for my Associates of Computer Science today :D I also took a tour of SVSU yesterday and talked to one of the counselors there . She answered a lot of the questions I was debating on and I'll either be starting there soon this Fall or Winter , depending on how many classes I take at < PROPFEMALE > to round out the 62 I can transfer over :D I'm 100% sure I wanna dorm there if I do :D 
stares at the screen through widened , bloodshot , puffy eyes , her mouth agape . \H-holy sh-shit . This is just ... too many ... just ... too many revelations in one damn morning . \"" 
I think ... I'll go eat now ... 
Just finished watching the Comic con Halo Reach panel O: the new forge looks SWEEEEET 
I am seriously confused ... the online communities seem to be conspiring against me ... O-O Oh noes ... the NHK ... they're out to get me D: I have been cursed with my hikikomori ways for too long ! X_x Zetsubou Shitaaaaaaa ~ 
For a day that's supposed have been all planned out ... it really sucks . >.> ( See notes ) 
Well , that went a bit better than I thought . I got 86 out of 119 ( 74%) on my test . It's a C , but I'm not really a C student o-o . Hopefully I'll do better next time . Gah , I feel like things are slipping away from my though . >.> me * jeeze ... D: I mean , I understand everything , but my luck is horrible lately . 
Gaaaah my head hurts X_x and I can't decide whether writing hates me or I hate writing at the moment . 
I be downstairs on my iPod ~ 
Rawr 
Thanks guys :D The internet is down at SVSU or I would have responded sooner XD was there all day .
