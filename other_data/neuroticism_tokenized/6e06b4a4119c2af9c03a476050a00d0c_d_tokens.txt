I need a guild idea ... :/ 

< PROPFEMALE > Gillespie isn't an old woman cultist . She's a teenage stripper that looks like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . Get your facts straight , < PROPMALE > ! 
Then again , < PROPFEMALE > doesn't look like < PROPFEMALE > . :/ 
I wonder if Silent Hill 8 will be available for PS3 ... Hmmm ... 
If I was in charge of this new Silent Hill team then I bet that I could make way better sequels . I might even turn this into a huge goal -- should Silent Hill even live on when I'm a bit older , that is . 
I hate Facebook . x.x 
Muwahahaha ! 
I want a river full of love ~ 
You've got to learn to act like God . You rule the world . You give the word . And if someone should fall behind , just let their suffering slip your mind . 
I think I'll < PROPMALE > in education and history . It could change , but it feels as if I've already made my final decision . I've always wanted to be a teacher ... Never knew history would be one of those choices . Life is strange . 
I've already started moving on with my life , but there's still that empty feeling in my heart . I know how to fill it , but I'm not sure if I should bother ... 
My fashion class is getting more fun as we finish sewing our samples ... I'm really getting the < PROPFEMALE > of it , and I'm considering getting a sewing machine so that I can work at it after school , but we'll have to see where this goes . xD Meanwhile , I can't wait ' til we start making clothes . Sweeeet . 
I signed up for < PROPMALE > club and a volunteer club . A few periods after I st < PROPMALE > ed regretting that I didn't take the Outreach to < PROPFEMALE > club instead of < PROPMALE > club . It just didn't coincide with the schedule for < PROPMALE > club ... Oh well , I can be in that club next year ! :) 
Invisible Children rock ! 
Alanis Morissette ... I am in love with her music all over again . 
I have something to confess ... \ 
\ 
Schoolwork is pretty fun . x.o 
I can be so sneaky ... I'd be proud of it if I wasn't feeling guilty , though . 
Apple and cinnamon oatmeal ... yummm . :D 
Man I hate liars ... -.- 
I used to listen to Evanescence and thought it was all the shit , but now listening to these even better female-fronted bands , I'm thinking , \What the hell was I on ? \"" 
I just noticed how creepy my profile picture is . LOL . 
( Yeah ) 1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , put in minority , and much else . All for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them that life will get better & that you respect them for who they are , copy & paste this . Most of you wont , but let's see the 5% of you who will . 
If we hold on together ~ ~ \ 
Oh Land Before Time ! My favorite movie as a child ... good times , good times . 
Psychosis sucks . 
You've got to learn to act like God\ 
You rule the world , you give the word\ 
And if someone should fall behind \ 
Just let their suffering slip your mind 
Happy late Halloween to all who reads this !! 
Take it slowly , begin with writing short stories . Sadly I run before I walk . NaNoWriMo is here but I'm not going to participate ... Instead I think I'll focus on officially starting my writing hobby ( should have done that 4 years ago ) with simple short stories . Whee . ( I also need ideas . ) 
The Silent Hill series are the best games ever hands down . I seriously wonder why Team Silent would give their masterpiece away to people who will botch its beauty . \ 
On a side note , I looked back on my < PROPFIRST > Sullivan obsession ... Sullivan is amazing because for some reason I can see him as an extension of myself , however there's no logical explanation for it , so what the hell ? 
Don't throw it away\ 
Live believing\ 
Dreams are for weaving\ 
Wonders are waiting to start\ 
Live your story\ 
Faith , hope & glory\ 
Hold to the truth in your heart 
Don't throw it away / Live believing / Dreams are for weaving / Wonders are waiting to start / Live your story / Faith , hope & < PROPFEMALE > / Hold to the truth in your heart 
Cullenists are an insult to humanity and actual religions . Joke or not , it's sickening and sad . I mad . 
ER HUR HUR HUR . 
Back when I was 5 or so , the only thing movie and song that made me cry were Land Before Time and If We Hold On Together . <3 
My forte is being an idiot . 
GAAAHHHH VIRUS INFECTING MY COMPUTER 
Why do teenagers not care for our world's history ? History has shaped the society we're in today , even if it's in a terrible state for the most part . Last year some boy said in my world history class that he didn't care about war . I guess that's the consequences of being an American ... either that or teenagers really are that bad . 
Yay for having a whole week off from school ! 
LOL . Tianenman Square / Tank Man reference in Family Guy . Awesome . 
Looking for a non-hardcore WoW RP private server . 
Happy Thanksgiving !! 
* sigh * No Thanksgiving dinner today . Our plan to go to Hometown Buffet backfired and we can't eat there for enough time ... Had my hopes up ... T_T \ 
Oh well , we're going tomorrow . 
OMG . I finished the first short story I've ever officially written ( sad for a writer , I know ) . It's 1930 words and is based on a wasteland setting . It's named \A\ 
Buildiiiiing . 
Nightwish's Dark Passion Play album just makes me want to take off and fly to the heavens ~ 
I need to write more ... 
I'm definitely majoring in education and minoring in either history or English . =D 
I need to get a guild idea and stick to it . >.> 
Rattling my brain for an RP guild idea that will stick . 
Why am I wasting my time on WoW ? I have a novel to write ... 
I relistened to My Chemical Romance for the first time in years ... I used to love that band . What the hell was I thinking ? o.o ... 
COD Black Ops or Halo Reach ? 
Can't get Halo Reach ... it's not on PS3 QQ 
I love to read history textbooks . 8 ) 
I Can't Tell the Sun From the < PROPFEMALE > is the best song ever . 
My English teacher sees me as a genius . 8D 
BWAHAHAHA I'M GETTING 2 PS3S ! 
[ WoW RP ] Whoo ! I'm getting better at emotes ! 
Whoo ! I'm getting better at emotes ! Now I just gotta type a bit faster without making any typos/mistakes . QQ 
< PROPFIRST > Swift's music is a guilty addiction . :/ 
Just being on Defiance is starting to seriously fuck up my mental health . And I don't talk about the shitty RPs . 
* sigh * 
* sigh 
Sigh * 
No time for sadness or hate . SMILE FOR ONCE . :D 
* sigh * ._. 
The Sniper is my favorite TF2 class . BOOM ! Headshot ! =D 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > has a terrible singing voice ... Why are Evanescence popular again ? 
:3 
I can't bear listening to Tarja Turunen's solo album ... If only she was in Nightwish again ... :/ 
I'm getting my WoW suscription back and I'm also planning on getting Cataclysm , too . I'll probably hit up the RP servers and have some fun roleplaying . Feel guilty though , since my dad has spent so much money on me these past weeks ... 
Man ... this patch download will take FOREVER . T_T 
MUST ... PLAY ... CATA ... 
Too lazy to post actual updates on my FB so I resorted to constantly changing my MSN status . 
YES ! To retail WoW I go ! 
Blizzard really outdid themselves with these amazingly colossal changes in Cata ... I don't even have the new expansion yet and I'm enjoying all of these new non-Cata features . <3 
Apparently there's a rap for everything nowadays ... o . 0 
If I could see my face as I watch a Ke$ha video I'd probably laugh my ass off . 
YES ! CATACLYSM ! 
YAY I GOT CATA . 
Worgen starting area is so boring . :/ 
Enough dilly dallying on WoW ! I need to work on my novel if I'm to become a literary genius ! 
._. 
\You are a pure and wonderful soul\ " ... <3 " 
I'm tired of being taken advantage of . Kindness is meant to be a privilege , not something that is shared with everyone . Especially to those who don't deserve it . 
Blegh . 
Level 26 in 11 hours ... not impressive enough . 
I HAVE NO LIFE . QQ 
Oh yeah and my profile pic is so outdated . I think I need to take a new picture of my currently fat self . I don't look cute anymore . T_T 
LAAAAZARS ! 
I wish I could find out who visited my Myspace . 
I think I'll start discussing with myself through Facebook statuses . 
I need to make a decision . Now . 
Screw MSN ! I think I need to get off my lazy ass for once and actually post my crap on Facebook . 
STATUS UPDATING MADNESS . 
I think I need to liven up my Facebook with funnier posts . Stay tuned . ( I hope this won't be too hard ... ) 
My computer just wiped all of my saved bookmarks and passwords in Firefox and even in AIM/MSN so I lost my old AIM Felenx because I completely forgot the password . T_T So add my new one : Penellykins 
It's so degrading when owners dress their pets up in silly clothes . >.< 
BAM ! NUTSHO -- OH CRAP THAT'S A WOMAN . 
WRITING POEMS . Awesome fun . Gotta share these with poetry club . 
I wrote an amazing poem ! So I AM a genius after all ! :D !!! 
Perhaps my true self isn't as fantastic as I would believe it ... I'm still unsure as to whether I can be \myself\ " . I suppose my writing and my character are meant to be two separate entities in one body ... * shrug * " 
It really does feel like I'm two souls sharing the same body ... 
Nevermind Penellykins . I'm back on Felenx since my computer reverted back to its original state ( however the term would be ) , so I got all of my bookmarks and saved passwords back . Hoorah . 
Hey , I'm not that immature . :( 
Wisdom . 
< PROPFIRST > Lambert's music is another guilty addiction ... 
I JUST REALIZED THAT I CAN WATCH HISTORY DOCUMENTARIES ON NETFLIX . AMG . 
:D ! 
Why do I bring my drama on FB and not on paper ? o.o 
No . I'm not sad . I'm just contemplating , FB . 
... And when I actually have someone to take my crap to I choose Facebook instead . WHOO . 
Am I the only person that cares about this world and its welfare ? Wait ... maybe I AM on an alien planet . No wonder I'm so out of touch with this world . Haha . 
Screw logic . Intuition is what connects us all as human beings . It's sad very few understand its importance . 
I need to learn how to stand up for myself and speak my mind for once . I'm going to work on that once I can . 
I hope the next time I face someone obnoxious I will actually go ahead and chew their face off for being an idiot . 
I now feel the need to bite peoples ' heads off when they're being a dumbass . The question is if I can do it . 
Intuition . 
:D 
Change . 
The power in my neighborhood was out for the whole day yesterday ... It was SUPPOSED to be boring that night but I ended up having fun watching candle flames and thinking until I went to bed . 
I'm tired of being taken advantage of . Kindness is meant to be a privilege , not something to be shared with just about everyone . Especially if they don't deserve it . 
Typically I am an open-minded person , but it really pisses me off when people believe in the existence of God or gods as being explainable by science . Has it ever occurred to their silly little minds that the human brain cannot comprehend everything ? That it's simply ridiculous to assume such a thing ? 
Lately I've been debating with myself about whether humanity's true nature is good or bad . I made quite an interesting speculation . If I could just develop it more then it might be amazing ... <3 
* sigh * For some reason the undeserving ones are the ones I \befriend\ " and the ones that are deserving don't care about me . ._. " 
Change is most prominent in the air . 
I need to be less serious . 
Girls that play video games =/ = attractive . But hey , what can a girl do about it ? 
Natural born loner . \ 
... And I really don't care about that for the most part . I enjoy my alone time . \ 
Just clearing up any mysteries , of course . I don't think anyone really wonders about that , though . 
Level 36 in 19 hours ! AHAHAHAHA I HAVE NO LIFE . 
Alliance should get a band , too ! 
Quagmire is creepy looking ... 
I deserve better people . 
Bahahaha . Picture overload ! I think I should make an album for these . 
I'm going to make a WoW webcomic using posed screenshots taken from a private server . I just need to come up with a story , characters , and write a script and I'll be set . Hopefully this will turn out to be a successful project . However , the question is whether this will be a serious webcomic or a funny one . I'm still deciding . 
The production of \Zuundi and Company\ " has officially started . " 
I love Alanis Morissette's music ... <3 
I don't like having fat under my < PROPFEMALE > . I need to work out . I'll do it eventually ... 
Zucchini . 
Someday I will ship a bunch of hamsters to Blizzard headquarters and force their computers to run on hamster wheels . That will give technology a run for its money . 
My flashlight brings all the zombies to the room ! Damn right , they're gonna rape you . \ 
/L4Djoke 
\I bet she likes Uldaman ! \ " - Biddy Rimbolt " 
Moron : \i dont ' assume ' anything . bcuz < PROPFEMALE > u assume things 
Seven pages of Zuundi and Company already , counting the first three already released . This is fun . :D 
Biddy Rimbolt : \Are we being seated next to a bathroom or something ? Because it's starting to stink up in here . \ " \ 
\I was a model student blah blah I got straight A's in all of my classes blah blah I spent over 7 hours on my homework blah blah . If I can do it why can't you ? This is ridiculous 
I love Alanis Morissette . For the most part she makes wonderful music , not that hip hop or rap crap that has no real meaning to it . 
I love my natural writing voice and style , but I'm not that great of a writer . Pretty amateurish if you ask me . Nonetheless I shall improve ! 
Retail roleplay ! :D 
Lunapathy . LOO-NAAH-PA-THEE . Beautiful if it's what it should be pronounced . A mix of \lunatic\ " and \ " psychopath\ " and created by me 
Facebook status : \Going to the store to buy tampons . \ " \ 
Lunapathy . 
I wish I went to school today ... 
I DECIDED TO CONTINUE ZUUNDI AND COMPANY ! :D 
\This sucks cog ! \ " - Biddy Rimbolt " 
WoW is such a waste of time ... I can't believe I'm still bothering with it . 
Maybe < PROPMALE > Cayce will be correct in his prediction of WWIII ... With all of this tension in Egypt and Libya and whatnot ... 
I hope the middle east will be alright . X_X 
How can something like this bother me so ? 
All of a sudden my fears disintegrate and I am met with the refreshing sense of peace . Both within my own house and with my worries of the world's future . <3 
Science doesn't matter unless it's to save a life . 
I don't hate humanity . In fact , I love humanity . Although we are corrupt and stupid we still have a < PROPMALE > at redeeming ourselves and work towards our true potential . Science will not help us any . It will only destroy us more so than we already are destroyed . 
Weird ... I feel as if I had channeled a completely different person . 
I'm often stupid on Facebook but I don't genuinely care for forgiveness . Whatever I said is said and I don't change my mind when I know it's the truth for me . 
Apparently my third eye is opening up . 
Damn the internet for not having enough information on Cayce's predictions . Apparently California sinking into the sea was predicted to happen years ago -- or so I just read now . Of all of the searching I did many days ago I never found out the exact dates of it all . ._. 
California Gurls music video = WTF ? 
Procrastinating at the moment . I should be writing my satire piece for English but I'm getting so damn distracted . This satire piece though is kind of difficult . 
Applying to scholarships . 
I just recently made a roleplaying character with my first name . Conceited or what ? 
Today I heard someone say that they didn't know what the word \ignorance\ " meant . o_o " 
YEAAAAAH ! I got good reviews on my Dear < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > satire that I posted on Fictionpress . <3 
Lol at people who use dyslexia as an excuse for poor grammar . 
HOLY CRAP . Wall spam ! Thank you everyone ! :D \ 
I'M 17 NOW . YAY ! 
I just went to the doctor because of this sharp-shooting pain in my right shoulder and in turn he prescribed me with flu medicine . I don't get it . -.- 
Hmmm ... < PROPMALE > Cayce predicted Japan would go underwater and that the entire west coast of US would as well . That prediction already happened in a way but it wasn't as bad as said to be . Phew ? 
Sure , I go on these frenzies and get rather pissy but I'm actually a very open-minded person . ._. 
I hope the people in Japan will be well after all of that .
