The only reason we live is because we still have hope ; hope that things will return to the way they were or things will change .. - .. hope that even though it might not work out now , in the end it will .. - .. but what we really hope for is that we might learn to let go of the past , and maybe , just maybe , we'll learn to love again ... ~ ~

Don't give a damn about what others say and be a rebel for once , because then can you truly say that you've truly followed your heart ... and isn't that something worth doing ? 
\When you stop thinking and start feeling\ " - you've discovered that elusive thing called ' love ' ... \ 
Guys who say they prefer ' good girls ' are liars , because good girls wouldn't dare steal my <3 
Sometimes the only thing you can do is to come out of the box , open the windows , let the wind blows , and just enjoy the ride that is life XD 
Who the hell in their right mind would wake up at 6 just to come to a class that starts at 9 ??? Hey , they don't call me ' insane ' for nothin ' LMAO
