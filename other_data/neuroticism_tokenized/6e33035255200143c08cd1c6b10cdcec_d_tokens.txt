To do all the things you did , \

Be a hairdresser , cook and friend , \ 
Yet find time to be a playmate , \ 
I just can't comprehend . \ 
I see now it was love , Mom\ 
That made you come whenever I'd call , \ 
Your inexhaustible love , Mom\

His favorite song of all\ 
Is the song of the redeemed\ 
When lost sinners now made clean\ 
Lift their voices loud and strong\ 
When those purchased by His blood\ 
Lift to Him a song of love\ 
There's nothing more He'd rather hear\ 
Nor so pleasing to His ear\ 
As His favorite song of all

Could we with ink the ocean fill , \ 
And were the skies of parchment made , \ 
Were every stalk on earth a quill , \ 
And every man a scribe by trade ;\ 
To write the love of God above\

Nor could the scroll contain the whole , \ 
Though stretched from sky to sky .

When the waves are crashing ’round you\ 
When the fiery darts surround you\

That’s when God wants to hear you sing
