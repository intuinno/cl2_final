you know what i sayin G ? 
one of these days-tim mcgraw 
One of these days you're gonna love me\ 
You'll sit down by yourself and think\ 
Of all the times you pushed and shoved me\ 
And what good friends we might have been\ 
And then you're gonna sigh a little\ 
And maybe even cry a little\ 
But one of these days you're gonna love me 
She’s a rebel child and a preacher’s daughter\ 
She was baptized in dirty water\ 
Her mama cried the first time they caught her with me\ 
They knew they couldn’t stop her\ 
She holds tight to me and the Bible\ 
On the back seat of my motorcycle\ 
Left her daddy standing there preaching to the choir , you see\ 
God love her\ 
Oh , me and God love her 
Cover up with makeup in the mirror\ 
tell yourself , it's never gonna happen again\ 
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you . \ 
Do you feel like a man when you push her around ? \ 
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground ? \ 
Well I'll tell you my friend , one day this world's going to end\ 
as your lies crumble down , a new life she has found .
