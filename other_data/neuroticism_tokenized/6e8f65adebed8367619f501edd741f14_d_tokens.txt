On this Mothers Day I thank God for giving me the gift of motherhood . The daily moments made with my boys < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > like lemonade made by the boys and our water gun fights , or their funny comments about their soon to be brother , the loving hugs and the < PROPFEMALE > days at the beach watching them play in the sand . 
No Mothers Day gift of Jewelry , < PROPFEMALE > , cards and a dinner could top the\ 
daily gifts I receive by being the mother of my boys given by God . \ 
Happy Mothers Day !

And why am I still up at 3am ? 
There is such a calming\ 
effect about Saturday mornings . A new hope for adventure . The sun is \ 
shining through the window .. as if I have been kissed by God . < PROPMALE > \ 
just woke and is talking to me in his baby chat . The sky's the limit . It\ 
is going to be a great day ! 
Enjoying my homemade spicy chicken chili topped with spooned cornbread . I could eat this for breakfast ! 
Ok now ... We were just hooked up for Verizon today . There was not a knock on the door or anything !! Very poor service ! And if there is a problem with it working ? : > l 
I did not realize that when we signed up with Verizon that I had to be the installer !! You won't see ranting statuses from me often , but come on now ! I don't have time or the mind set for this ! 
Now I know why there wasn't a knock on the door from Mr. Verizon ... he never showed up ! After 2 weeks of waiting and nothing ! If any of you are thinking about getting Verizon for your home services , save your time and money . 
I am going to throw my printer out the window ...

It is almost November and it is 79 degrees in VA !! I am ready for Fall weather ! 
I love being close to nature and all , however at almost 12AM it freaks me out to hear something breaking the branches on the ground in the woods behind our house . It is probably deer , but spooky just the same . Closing windows ... bye , bye cool breeze . 
The woods are alive with music .. our neighbor Mr. Owl and his pals . Our deer should be out and about soon . Noisy little guys ! 
The tracker thing is not such a good idea . Read the small print first . 
Feeling blessed to have a roof over our heads . I never realized how many homeless\ 
families there are right here in Williamsburg Va . Very sad . A pastor that I was talking to said they are expecting a record high ... this includes kids . Just sad .

Really missing my family and friends in New Jersey . Looking forward to going back home soon . 
Can anyone fill me in on the last 3 weeks of House MD ?

My\ 
Husband has made me laugh . Made me cry . Wiped my tears . Hugged me \ 
tight . Watched me succeed . Seen me fail . Cheered me on . Kept me going \ 
strong . My Husband is a promise from God that I will have a Friend \ 
Forever . I love you < PROPFEMALE > !!! Put this as your status if you love your \ 
Husband ! 
Glad we made it home . Thanks Geico ! I am starting to find out a lot about people and who you can depend on . 
Just had my mother-in-laws fried rice . The best food ever ! That women can cook ! 
Big Boy < PROPMALE > has started eating baby cereal ! LOVES IT ! He is now an eating machine ! \ 
Problem is that now he wants to eat what everyone else is . 
< PROPMALE > says he likes the rain . Yeah < PROPMALE > do you like the rain or the muddles that the rain makes ? Two words ... wet sneakers ! 
Xmas ? Where is Christ in Christmas ? Isn't Christ the reason behind Christmas ? Why do people write Christmas this why ? Is it laziness ? Do not believe in his birth ? Just makes me wonder . A virgin birth of our Jesus who save us from our sins and this is what he gets ? 
Xmas ? Where is Christ in Christmas ? Isn't Christ the reason behind Christmas ? Why do people write Christmas this way ? Is it laziness ? Do not believe in his birth ? Or maybe they do not realize what they are doing . Just makes me wonder . A virgin birth of our Jesus who saved us from our sins and this is what he gets ? 
\Do not go where the path may lead 
Thank you everyone for the Birthday wishes ! 
I have not heard from < PROPMALE > in about a month . He calls me atleast once every two weeks . It has been over a month . Has anyone talked to him ?. I can not find his number . I am very worried . And yes , I know he is a big boy now . 
I love my 4 boys !! They exhaust me and I love every minute of it !
