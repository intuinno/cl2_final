Why was Google invented ? To make searching through mass amounts of information easy and organized . Why was wikipedia invented ? To create the largest database of human knowledge for the world to access at any moment . 
Tech Week ......... 
This mold turned out to be the basic form of Penicillin , arguably the most important discovery in the field of medicine ever . All science needed was for a man to come along who was so filthy that he actually would discover a form of filth that could kill other filth .

Welcome new Stevenson students ! It's definitely going to be a great year . ( Can't get much more cliche than that , am I right ? ) 
You know it's been a good history lecture when the lecturer quotes < PROPFIRST > Izzard and when the word \hot lead enemas\ " are thrown around . " 
It's such a cruel twist of fate when your own supermagnet wipes your hard drive clean .
