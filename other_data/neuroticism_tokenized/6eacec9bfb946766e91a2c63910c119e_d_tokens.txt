< PROPFEMALE > cut her hair :'(

Hi , I'm < PROPMALE > , a recovering facecrack addict . Have I missed anything ? I am too lazy to sort through the feed . 
Well , it's father's day and I have two children making me a dad . Oh , and < PROPFIRST > , happy father's day , Dad o ' Mine . 
Went and saw Predators last night . I enjoyed it . Though I kept mentally check referencing to the original Predator movie with Schwartzeneger , there was a good enough story and cool moments to keep a smile on my face throughout . What's the best way to kill a Predator ? One word : decapitation . Watch the movie to find out how its done . 
There , I've updated my profile pic , it's a little more up to date . 
Well crap :P Truck didn't want to start today . Gotta figure it out , one-car family until then . 
Yay ! My truck is working again . Don't want to change spark plugs ever again , my hands will thank me . 
So I'm told everyone is trying to get cartoon characters for profile pics . So here's my change . 
Thanks everyone for the Happy Birthday wishes :)
