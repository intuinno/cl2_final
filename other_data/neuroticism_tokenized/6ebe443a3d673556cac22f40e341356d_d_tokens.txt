Man , I wish there was a special pill that could remove writers block !!! 

Tomorrow's Friday !!! May it go by smooth and fast ! 
I wish I had a time machine so it could be the weekend everyday , but I still still pick up a pay check !! 
Please tell me it's not Monday ! I could have sworn it's Tuesday , but it's feeling like Monday ! 
I have always been a Rangers fan , and it has finally paid off !!! For the first time I am going to be watching the World Series ! Go Rangers !!!! 
I'm finally starting to feel better !!! Been sick all week ... it sucks ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! Hope you enjoyed the season ! 
Just got a cell phone . Finally ! Text me your name so I have your number please . 682-557-5234 
Just fixed my texting . If you sent me a text last night , please send it again . Sorry ! 
Wow ! Got one of those android smart phones and I'm loving it ! This is the technology advanced I've ever been ! 
Don't you just love it when real life seems to work to the beat of the music on the radio ! Just weird ! 
Construction , traffic light out , and wreck at the same intersection makes for a bad day getting home ! 
To all my gaming buddies on facebook : I am cuurently without internet and only able to access facebook through my phone right now . Thanks !
