You can't be to careful anymore when all that is waiting for you , won't come any closer . You've got to reach out a little more . 
I really don't understand why people have to not tell me the truth . I'm not judgemental . I just think it's not right . Whatever . I'm done . 
I want someone to send me a hermit crab over fishville . :( 
For my birthday i want a cute little black cocktail dress .

going back and remembering how i learned how to do long division . oh how i don't miss that at all . but i can't say the bionomial therom is any better . so many x's and y's and what choses what . but in the end , that's what pre-calc does to you . 
Can't wait til tomorrow . Hanging out with CyCy Breeden and < PROPFEMALE > Howell and < PROPFIRST > . :) Tomorrow will be epic . 
someone needs to send me a panda on farmville or else i will die . that will complete my valentines day ... not really but anyways . 
Lovin all the Paramore demos I downloaded . They're so good . Always know how I'm feeling . They just put it in better words than I ever could . 
Oh no , how could you do it ? Oh , I never saw it coming . Oh I need an ending . So why don't you stay long enough to explain ? 
Whoa , well I never ment to brag but , I got him where I want him now . Whoa it was never my intention to brag to steal it all away from you now . But God does it feel so good , cause I got him where I want him RIGHT now . And if you could than you know you would . Cause God it just feels so good . 
Keep your feet on the ground , when your head's in the clouds . Well go get your shovel and we'll dig a deep hole . To bury the castle , bury the castle . 
Oh father . Father , well I am ready . Won't you let it begin ? Cause I am here now . I want to dance in the mighty palm of your hand . 
This is the best thing that could've happened . Any longer and I wouldn't have made it . It's not a war , no , it's not a rapture . I'm just a person but you can't take it . 
Only two more days . I'm really upset I have to go school on Friday . There's no doubt in my mind that only epic things will happen this summer :D \ 
Who's ready to chill ? ;) 
I'm putting everything from my past behind me . Drama is lame . It's high school . There is no point in hating or not even getting along with someone for no reason . I love my life and where it has taken me :D 
It's been exactly one year today that I got my license . I should celebrate by not driving at all today . 
At my daddy's house and the doors are open and the kitties are sooo adorable ! i love life and i'm so happy about everything . :D 
Got a 4.0 for the last quarter of school . Also got my 3rd honor roll certificate for the year . :D 
I walked from my house to my dad's today . For those who doesn't know how far away that is , it is 4.23 < PROPMALE > . I'm pretty proud of myself :D 
Stop updating your status every five minutes . No one cares if you just ate a bagel ... sheesh . 
\I feel no sympathy . You live inside a cave . You barely get by and the rest of us are trying . There's no need to apologize . I've got no time for feeling sorry . And all the best lies 
RIP Gorganzola . :( I'll miss you baby fishie . You were my favorite and so cute . I loved all your energy and bubble blowing . I miss you so much :( \

Yay ? Happy a had homework on the first day at school . It's not the type of homework where your parents just have paper work . Nope , reading and blogging . Cool . 
I was told that someone always knew I had great talent . It seriously made my life . I've never heard that before and it made me smile so big . Thank you for believing in me even when I didn't . 
And you never told me that you wanted to love someone , somebody just like me . 
I hate when you're reading a story and it turns out to be really good and then has a horrible ending . Note to writers : write good endings or atleast let me know what happens . Sheesh . Night everyone .
