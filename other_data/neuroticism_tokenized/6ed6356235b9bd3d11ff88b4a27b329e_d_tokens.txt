Uler send a butt load of snow to Maine !!!! I feel the need for speed . 

God < PROPMALE > me the serenity \ 
to accept the things I cannot change ; \ 
courage to change the things I can ;\ 
and wisdom to know the difference . Living one day at a time ; \ 
Enjoying one moment at a time ; \ 
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace ; 
Heading to Durango tomorrow ! For anyone still in Durango , my number is 207-323-9191 
Another beautiful day in Maine , but oh the humidity .... 
OMG , I haven't performed since 2001 and tonight is my one and only dress reh . before a 10 show ( rain permitting ) run . God it feels good to be performing again ! 
How do you trust again after being betrayed ? How do you let the anger go ? How do you not want < PROPFEMALE > to kick the offending parties ass ? 
How long till ski season ? I am jonesing for some snow , and < PROPMALE > Miller ! 
Well ... I made to to 31 before ever running out of gas in my car . Good thing it happened right across the street from my house , and work is only . 9 < PROPMALE > away . Note to self $5 in gas doesn't last very long in my car 
Life is good , but what is the next big adventure or goal .... 
Holy Shit .... my parents have actually booked a ticket to come visit me . I didn't think it would actually happen . I can't wait to show them around my new home :) 
TGIF !!!! And I am going to Party this weekend :) 
An inspiring weekend , I am overwhelmed by the community that I live in , the spirit of the people who have come into my life , and the beauty of this world . 
Friday the 13th and a black cat ran across the road as I drove to work today . Should I be concerned .... 
Sing like no one is listening , dance like no one is watching , love like you have never been hurt 
I LOVE music . Nothing makes the day better than jamming out all day to tunes online . 
Carpe Diem 
Rainy days make me want to nest . 
My bed is calling me from across town .... 
To thine own self be true 
Note to self : when stopped by border patrol don't have high beams on , have license , don't laugh when they ask if you are a US citizen , and tell them if you have a spiked drink even as the passanger . Glad to see our borders are protected , but the follow through leave muchs to be desired . Although over all they were very polite , but then again it could have been racial profiling . 
Life is so wonderful ! 
No more miss nice girl ... I am going to embrace my power to stand up for what is right and protect myself and those I love . 
You can fool some of the people some of the time , but you can't fool all of the people all of the time . The truth will also come out in the end . 
How many bad things does a person have to do in their life before they become a bad person ? Is it ever possible to become a good person once you have lived your life in an evil , selfish , and dishonest way ? How much can anger at injustice and bad actions not being punnished and a < PROPFEMALE > for people to see the truth of a situation before they continue to associate with a bad person hurt my own soul ? 
How do you let go of the hurt and pain , the embarsment of being taken advantage of , and loving the wrong person in order to fully commit yourself to the current joys in your life and the amazing things the future holds ? 
I am a victim of domestic violence , my friend lost her life and her childern became orphans because of domestic violence . It can happen to anyone . We need to look at our fellow sisters , our daughters , and mothers and say enough is enough . Why do we not have a system to warn other women who these abusers are ? Or is < PROPFEMALE > closer to Iran and Africa when it comes to the safety of women than we care to admit . 
I love payday and 3 day weekends , double score ! 
It is amazing how magical the future can look when the right person is holding your hand . 
My thoughts are with Boulder and the Canyons being affected by the Four Mile Canyon Wildfire . Crazy to see the pictures from my old home knowing where the pictures are being taken , the mountain bike trails , the shooting ranges , and remembering the smell of ash and the color of the sky during a wildfire . 
Gonna jump on my bike and ride . 
monday , monday 
Buffett has ruled no double-dip recession , therefore it must be true . I will now ignore all media and political claims to the contrary . 
Tired of waiting for my ship to come in , time to get back on track and build my own . 
13.5 days until the parent's descend on Maine . 
It is time to repeal \Don't ask don't tell\ " If you are willing to die for your country I don't care who you choose to love . " 
You would think a B.A. , a B.S. , and MBA , and 10 years of diverse work experience in Business , Accounting , Finance , and Managment would count for something . I am tired of not being treated with respect . 
So many inspiring programs on Hulu ! 
Does anyone have any advice on how to legally force someone to refinance or sell something that is jointly financed ? 
I am so glad my parents come back to town tomorrow ... lots to show them and wine and margs to be drunk 
Yes this is the < PROPFEMALE > I want to see , Federal Judge orders military to stop discharging gays !!!!!! Maybe we can truly be the land of free one day !

Happy Birthday from Colorado ! 3 inches of fluffy stuff on the ground just for you . Can't wait to see the tattoo 
the past is in the past , the present I control , and the future is full of possibilies , so why does the past haunt and piss me off so much 
Woo Hooo Snow !!!!! It finally feels like winter and Christmas , can't wait to strap into the bindings . 
Don't forget to do good deeds as you accumulate wealth .

Truly Scary the Palin listed Dem . Rep. < PROPFEMALE > Giffords ' name on her facebook < PROPFEMALE > with crosshairs rallying people to fight the left over a year ago . Scarier that hers is not the only name listed . When will people learn hate begets hate ....

This week we remember babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all lost angels 
A cancer patient only has one wish , to get better . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer post this for at least one hour !

It's almost the weekend !!!!! Red wine is calling my name .

It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy .. but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are 
To all those who have lost someone close to them ... Please be joyous in the moments you shared and the lessons they taught you . Forever strive to be the people they hoped you would be and see yourself as beautiful as they did . 
money doesn't buy happiness but it sure greases the wheels of life ! 
I am smiling realizing how many people remember me fondly and hoping my life is going well considering my gamble . 
Music makes the day go much faster ! Now if I could just be jammin at a club in Europe .... 
love my eye doctor seeing me at 7pm ... not loving the concern and tone in his voice as he explains what can happen with my condition . I think I am high on his list for needing < PROPMALE > sug within 5 years . 
my thoughts and prayers go out to Japan and Hawaii and the other 19 countries which are on stand-by for a Tsunami expected to hit in 3 hours . an 8.9 quake is no joke and a 10 meter Tsunami is terrifying . 
the greater the risk the greater the reward 
My horoscope says I should take the day off and drink a lot of scotch ... 
have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones that will !! Think of the ones you know or love who has or had cancer . My wish it that 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour ? Do it for all . There are too many to mention who have fought and who are fighting . I hope to see this in all the statuses of my friend 
I am tired of people making themselves feel superior by pigeon-holing people and making simple things seem extremely complicated 
wow ... fate you are really serious about what my path should be . 
roll the dice ... come on next big < PROPMALE > 
OMG is my life really turning into my dream life more and more every day .... Can I really have it all . Yes I think I can with a little elbow grease , good thoughts , and gratitude 
If your Dad is , or was , a hard working man , and is your hero , has helped you no matter how good or bad you were , and is just the best Dad ever , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one Dad 
Be still my skittish heart 
Please everyone sending my divalious thoughts today

Has anyone in Maine heard if route 3 is open ? I have heard rumors and am worried about my man in < PROPFEMALE > 
ready for my first 5k ... wonder how the snow/slush/mud will affect the run . 
well thought I would give the jeep a try ... didn't quite work out . At least I got it home , to bad I blocked the driveway when it died . 
FYI , if you are doing a search on google/yahoo on Firefox and you get directed to bogus webpages you have a nasty virus . 
woohoo time from 5K on Sun 29.20
