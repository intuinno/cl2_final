I hate most 90s grunge bands , but Staind is an exception . 
I wonder what's on Facebook's mind ? 
I've been craving some < PROPMALE > Marstiller . 
Pulley don't play no suckah's game ! 
It is a known fact that the majority of < PROPFIRST > Gonzalez's friends on Facebook are made up by him . 
I love how Black Ops favors campers and claims that it's now more balanced than MW2 . I can < PROPFEMALE > for false advertisement right ?

Sinuses will kill me before my self loathing does .... 
¿Por qué la biblioteca me odian !? 
Lost and Battlestar Galactica are god awful shows and not worth watching at all because the ending of those series don't wrap up all the question . It's like the writers were just making it up as they went and didn't even have a 6 year plot set out to begin with ! 
So < PROPFIRST > is starting his rape courier service back up . I wouldn't have thought < PROPFIRST > to be the kind of person for that . 
What threat does a mosque does a threat pose to Tennessee ? 
Tsunami , Earthquakes , nuclear meltdowns in Japan , Civil unrest in the Middle-East , Chinese Military bragging about crappy military , near world depression , Mass animal deaths ; If I didn't know any better I'd say the world was ending . 
Saw Mega Mind today ! It was good . 
All successful black people go crazy : < PROPFIRST > 3 , 000 , Tiger Woods , < PROPMALE > Chappelle just to name a few . 
MUST ..... GET ....... OUT !!!!! 
I do love me some Paramore . 
M24s are available to the public ??? I want one .

If the third time's the charm , I just struck out . ( Best Pun Ever ) 
My Cat's Name is no longer Venny , it's < PROPFEMALE > !! 
I need something to do today .

Just got my hands on a Schindler's List Easy Bake Oven . 
I have so many friends , yet I'm never around them . What's the point of having them ? 
What would you wish for if you had one < PROPMALE > to ? 
I have 99 cents left on Itunes , yet I can't buy a song that's 99 cents . Go die < PROPMALE > Jobs , Go die . 
So much time and so little to do . 
If the Ruskies beat us to Mars , who will claim the asteroid belt ? I hope you all are ready to make a million American Flags . 
You all have one minute to wish me a happy birthday . 
The river will run red with the blood of ... yeah I have no idea where I'm going with this . 
IT'S FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY , I see my friends .
