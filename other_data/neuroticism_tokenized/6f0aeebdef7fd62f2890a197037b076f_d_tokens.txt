Everyone ! comment on my wall and say some words of encouragement . 
NIGHT EVERYONE ! 
“I can't deny it , yet I can't say it . It has been said , but not directly . If there were words to describe it , then why do none come to mind . I am an open book , yet I am locked up like a safe . Still , I will continue to wait patiently , but why do I feel the need to pace ? Why is it hard to say our deep inner feelings ? Although , there is one thing I can say . To me , you warm my soul , as the sun warms the earth . \ " , 2009-12-03 15:24:45 "
