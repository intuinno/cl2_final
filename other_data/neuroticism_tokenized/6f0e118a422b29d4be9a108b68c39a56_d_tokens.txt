Your stitches are all out , but your scars are all healing wrong . And the helium balloon inside your room has come undone ... 
You spent half of your life trying to fall behind , you're using your headphones to drown out your mind , it was so easy , and the words so sweet , you can't remember ... You try to move your feet ... 
This is how it works : you're young until you're not , you love until you don't , you try until you can't , you laugh \ 
until you cry , you cry until you laugh , and everyone must breathe until their dying breath
