There's no reason to fear the inevitable , be it truly inevitable\ 
\I'm afraid\ " are not words of weakness but of uncertainty in the coming change . \ 
Tired of getting scars born of insignificance , \ 
Tired of damaging my pride with those two words , \ 
Tired of working so hard to get nothing but shit , \ 
Effort goes two ways , \ 
This time it's my turn to be pissed , \

I have a healthy obsession with < PROPFEMALE > nut cheerios 
needs a place to train and spar 
so me & God was talking today and he basically told me that most every book in the bible had been corrupted by its scribe , rewritten to suit personal opinions so he'd like to clear a few things up : He does not hate homosexuals , He does not demand your fear only ask for your love , he can not help with everything that's the point of letting us choose , & he is ashamed of most of the actions being claimed in his name 
Thanks everyone for the happy birthdays :)
