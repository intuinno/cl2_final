D: Facebook doesn't have that one myspace application , Poke T_T That's the best application ever ! D: 
I don't feel good at all today . :( It's killing me ... And when I say ' I don't feel good ' , I do mean my mood . 
ahh my homework is going horribly ! i'm thinking in circles for 30 minutes , and then i'm back on square 1 T_T 
needs a new picture for her facebook ...

Too ... Much ... Homework ... T_T ... Why ... can't ... I ... just ... BECOME A MAGICIAN AND FINISH THEM IN A SECOND ?! 
is having a horrible day ... again ... -sigh- T_T 
Feels sad and oddly empty and lonely T_T 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Mullaly ~ Aw , I feel bad for < PROPFIRST > ... 
Neorago ~ :D <3 
OMG I AM SO EXTREMELY HYUPOIR :D AO[W5IHKL ; sn5#%) ($*) _$*() YOU WILL NEVER CATCH MWE ! > O 
Really needs a hug ... T_T But no , nobody here is online and if they are they don't want to give me a hug ... 
I . Love . Sparknotes ! It's the best AND perfect website for studying , book understandation , and a lot more ! It definitely helps me when I need help understanding a book , or trying to review Genetics and the Revolutionary War ! 
So ... much ... homework T_T I'm going to die ! How am I going to finish this ALL by today ?! 
ahhh ! T_T they won't animate my dancing ducky on facebook ... T_T 
< PROPFEMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > - I love you lotz ! <3 
Back from the basketball game ! OUR TEAM KICKS BUTT ! > O ( but i don't ) Final score : 50-10 ! :D It would've been 50-6 ... but they got their best player on court . x_x 
I feel so untouched that I want you so much that I just can't resist you . It's not enough to say that I miss you . I feel so untouched right now , need you so much somehow . I can't forget you ! I've gone crazy ever since the moment I met you ~ :] Great song ! Get's stuck in my head , though ... 
When I see your smile , the tears run down my face . I can't replace ... And now that I'm stronger I've figured out how this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul . Yet I can find , deep inside me , that I can be the one . I will never let you fall , I'll stand up with you forever . I'll be there for you through it all , even if saving you sends me to heaven . 
I'll always be waiting here for you ... Forever and Always ! ^^ <3 
I might stay up all night doing the commercial . I think I'll try posting every hour ... it's currently 1:25 AM . 
2nd hour posted ! 
Forgot to post last hour , sorry ! Too busy ... T_T Anyway , 4th post ! ^^ 
i'm taking a break anyway , so i'm gonna post my 5th one before time 5th post ! ^^ 
The commercial went VERY well ! EVERYONE loved it ! ^^ 
Wee I'm so happy ~ I don't have as much homework as I did last night ! I can actually sleep tonight ! ^^ 
We lost ... final score : 14-16 x_x We did so good though , but the other team cheated . If you do good , then you will never win if the opposite team cheats . The referee favored the other team , too . They fouled us a whole bunch of times and he gave them the ball ... 
Baby don't worry , you are my only . You won't be lonely , even if the sky is falling down . Down , down . Baby are you down down down down down . I love that song ! ^^ 
Insults , ignores , racism , worry , pain ... is that really all ? Yet every single time ... I have to try and get up again ... alone ... Life is so empty , and the only love I receive ... is from my family and God . Our limits in life are always bound , and yet this was the lesson that we humans have to receive . The only thing we can learn the most from is from emotional/physical pain , humiliation , and sin . 
I REALLY need a picture ... x_x Grr ! Where is the camera , < PROPFEMALE > ?! T_T 
( Warning ... Warning ... Warning , the drama < PROPMALE > is in the buiding ... the drama < PROPMALE > building is in the building ... ) 1 ! 1 ! 2 ! 2 ! .. 3 ! 4 ! 5 ! 5 ! 6 ! Se7en ! [ My comment : That was some WICKED counting !! Counting the wrong < PROPFIRST > at the wrong time , yet it's still the lyrics ? Wicked !! ] 
I'm ... so ... tired ... yet ... I ... have ... so ... much ... homework ... and ... studying ... to ... do ... 
\A close friend reveals a hidden talent . \ " - Fortune Cookie o_o " 
Wahh T_T I miss Koko-kun and Kuro-chan ... and maybe Cakey too ? o_o Which reminds me , Cow-chan , Moon-chan , and Poo-chan haven't been on for a long time , too . x_x Or is it just me ? 
GRR !! My heart beat keeps on thumping in my ears and throughout my whole body , and it's getting annoying ! And I'm not even nervous or anything ! 
Yayy ~ I gotta live with today and the half day tomorrow AND FALL BREAK'S HERE ! :D 
Take a look at me so you can see how beautiful you are . You call me a stranger , you say I'm a danger . But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight . I'm looking abandoned . You are an angel , making all my dreams come true tonight ... 
Finally out of school ! ( Well , I was supposed to be out about 30 minutes ago , but my sister came late ) 
Just lost her Secondhand Serenade CD . T_T -cries- Wahhh ... Nuuu ~ I want it back . T_T 
OMG I JUST FOUND MY CD YAYYY !! ;DDD SDFL;KANSFq@(#)*)_#*$_#_$*I'M SO HAPPY

Family depression ... again ... 
Has too much homework ... but I HAVE to go to sleep now , ' cause I'm practically dying from my lack of sleep . 
It's obvious . Right here is where the party starts with you and me , all alone , no one has to know . It's obvious to me , how it's gonna be . It's obvious ... when you come close to me . -Yo , Hey Mondayy !! <3 
Has a cramp in her calf . T_T It really hurts ...

The world is spinning around me ... I see dead people . The future ... the present ... the past ... the alive ... and the dead . 
Noo ... why did you have to die ? Why did you have to leave me ? When you're gone , all of the realization in my life is just standing right before me . I've been alone my whole life time . There's no one here ... there's no one here ... All I would've asked for was that I wanted someone to stay ... but I guess that's too much . I've been alone my whole life ... You have died , and you've died becuase of me . I'm so sorry ...

My story , my life , my love ... MY SONG <3 
I can take away your loneliness from the deepest pits ; I bring happiness in your darkest time of fear ; I sometimes cause the tension between family fits ; And yet , I can make you shed a tear . I am the reason you look forward to tomorrrow ; I hold you in my arms when everything's gone ; I form the reason why you are in sorrow ; I cut your heart open , break it into pieces , but not for long . What am I ? ( : 
MANNNN ~ 6th hour was AWESOMEEEEE !!!!!

Time together is just never quite enough ... When you and I are alone , Iíve never felt so at home (: What will it take to make or break this hint of love ? We need time , only time .

WHY is it that just one phrase , one action , or even word can make you happy during the whole day ... and yet just ONE word/action/phrase can cancel it all and make you depressed ? 
haha ... i LOVEEEE it when u find out who deleted u as a friend >:} 
The sky is gray . It's crying ... it's tears splatter against the floor ... the lightning tearing the world apart ... Remember , you're supposed to be happy . It's all I ever wanted , but it comes with a price .

Does this happen to anyone else ? When you aren't trying to be funny , you are funny . But when you're trying to be funny , you're not funny . And sometimes when you're not trying to be funny , people think you're trying to be funny , so they start fake laughing .

Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status .

New text message from 32665187 ( Facebook ): Please make a voice call to 911 . There is no text service to 911 available at this time . ( WTF ?! ) 
Do you ever wonder what girls look like without all that makeup on ? I do . D: 
We all have SECRETS but in the end all we need to do is to APOLOGIZE ? so we can still keep MARCHIN ' ON . We are only a PASSENGER in this GOOD LIFE . HEARING VOICES from those you ? care about . So say how you feel about them and be DREMIN OUT LOUD , and don't STOP AND STARE at your problems . ~ O.R. <3 
Why is it that perfect conversations and true friends only exist in stories and fairytales , but not in real life ? 
??? ~ :D <33333333 
People should learn to stop tickling people who are extremely ticklish . -cough- Especially when the extremely ticklish people hate being tickled and it ruins their day . 
I love my friends :) They persevered with me through all the ups and downs , stayed by my side , and were still my friends even after all of those hard times and hardships . They were still willing to talk to me every day even after I ignored them , insulted them , and pushed them away . Thanks for being in my life :) <3 
???? ~ ( T T___T T thanks michael ~ )

Hey , tomorrow's \Hug a tall person\ " day ! :oo " 
The past that I knew and loved ... a lie . All of it was a LIE . 
grabbing onto silky-bed-sheets-that-are-abou t-t o-fall-off-the-bed to prevent yourself from falling off the bed as you're falling off the bed is NOT a good idea . 
Sometimes ... I wish you'd look at me for more than 2 seconds . When you don't talk to me , it bugs me . I wish I actually knew you .. not the person that you left behind . 
loves Davido < PROPFEMALE > for being the bestest best best best guy best friend evar . :)) and her sister , QinQin Jiang for being her homemade BANANA SPLIT CAKE ! >:D and < PROPMALE > Yiin , just ' cause he is . :P psh . don't yell at me for tagging you now .
