Support bacteria !! ( its the only culture some people have )

that thing has gotten smaller every year , its sad =[ \ 
but they still have the zipper !!! now , to buy a bag of marbles ... 
just learned , that in order to be certified ' organic ' , a company cannot treat sick animals with antibiotics , so they just die .... everything is stupid . 
Riding ' the zipper ' with 11 multi-colored tennis balls makes for an AWESOME night at the carnival . 
dead kennedys playin new years < PROPFEMALE > will have a 99.9% < PROPMALE > of being cooler than parties . ( minus that one year we spent new years heckling halo on x box with that awesome little kid on the other side of the country . )

When one side is comparing any THOUGHT of lifting a leg to launching light years , and the other side is complaining that what is being done is never enough in expecting instant gratification , how does one move at all ? 
I knew we were in trouble when i was the youngest person in the polls by an easy 40 years , and the only one NOT wearing some off-shoot of a ' freedom isnt free ' shirt ... 
when two crowd surfers merge into the same longitude and latitude points , the result is a mass of people on the ground .
