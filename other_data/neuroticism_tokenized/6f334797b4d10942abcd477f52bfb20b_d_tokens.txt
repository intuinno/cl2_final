So I just finished Silent Hill : Shattered Memories and , let me tell you , what a TRIPPY game . Basically , at the end , you find out that you don't even exist , outside of a a little girl's imagination ; she made you up ' cause she never had a father figure ., and you're fighting against a psychiatrist who is trying to make your daughter normal , but that would make you cease to exist , because you're completely made up . 
I see things like morality , right and wrong , and just questions of life in general in a very ambiguous way . I wonder if my views will become more entrenched and one-sided as I become older ? Every adult I can think of is very hard headed about this sort of thing . 
You're having problems with your bank , issues with your credit card , work , transportation , bills , everything seems to be going to hell . And then , just when it seems nothing could get any worse , out come the wolves . 
I gets teh Xbox back . Gamertag : IplayDreamcast\ 
If you play any of the games I play , add me .

Quake Live Arena is FUCKING AWESOME ! Anybody who has an Xbox and some FPS skill , pick it up . 
Honesty is overrated , sometimes , I'd rather be lied to . 
Anybody who has an Xbox , download Quake Arena Arcade NOW ! The game is awesome , worth the money , and I'll actually play it with you . 
JESUS ! Your house is COVERED in French Hen and Turtuledove feathers ! And what's with all of these dead peach trees lying around here ? What has your true love been giving you these past twelve days ? 
Your work really hard in anticipation of a good life , you snap your fingers , you snap your neck , what you don't realize , is that the good life is what you make it . Your time is RIGHT FUCKING NOW people . And it is what you make it . 
Go ahead , put that beer in the fridge , making it colder won't make it taste any better . 
The ENTIRE WINTER it doesn't snow , and all of a sudden it snows up to my fucking knees . Wow , I can't even get to work , this is BS . This is the second most snow I have EVER seen not on a mountain . And I'm from Idaho . 
There's nothing that ' God ' can give to me that I can't give to myself . \

Why are you being so evil ? This is uncalled for ! Stop being evil , or I shall speak with you no longer , at least for as long as you continue to be evil . God , something wrong with all the evil people these days . \ 
* Shakes head in utter disappointment with all the evil people these days * 
I'm really getting fed up with everything , people mess with my Facebook , there's nothing to eat in my house , people are playing COD , some people are playing PS3 instead of Xbox , I have a headache , today was a really long day , I basically did three peoples ' shifts , credit cards , bills , top 40 hits music lists ... I'm losing my mind here .

I'm ranked No . 100 on Quake Arena Arcade on Xbox Live . \\m/ (X.X) \\m/ 
Just started watching deception , and if the whole movie is a dream , I called it . 
Alright then , finished watching Inception . The movie was ... good . It was good . I didn't go in expecting much , if everyone says something is great , it usually sucks , but the movie was decent . 
I woke up today and realized what a fool I've been ..... I'm switching to PS3 
I woke up today , and I obviously woke up drunk , because my judgment was severely impaired , and I somehow got PS3 and Sexbox Threesexy mixed up in my mind . 
Forza 3 is so much more amazing than Gran Turismo . Wow , Forza truly is a step above the competition . 
I remember when I was a kid , I think my uncle it was , tried to convince me that , \Oh my gosh\ " was a satanic phrase and that I shouldn't say it . " 
The point of religion is to make life easier , when people use religion to make everything more difficult for everybody , it defeats the purpose . The simple mans way of staying sane and filling his life with purpose becomes a very real negative force in his life , and the lives of everyone around him . 
So , you think your some tough guy or something ? Walking around like you're the dopest trip or something , well , let's just see just how tough you are when I BEAT YOUR SCORE IN GEOMETRY WARS ! 
Watching some Quake Live , and since when was Fox more accurate with rails than toxiq ?!? Eight frags in like the first three minutes on ZTN !! OMG I think I have a runner up for QL athlete of the year , behind Av3kkk from Poland . 
It's like 7:00 AM and I didn't sleep all night . Did one energy drink REALLY fuck me up THAT MUCH ? I have to go to work today ! 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone , or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they haven't been eaten by dragons or don't believe in dragons . 6% of people ... are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , whilst the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this . 
Needs to sit in a quiet place with a pen and paper to organize his thoughts . 
So I didn't sleep all night , gave up at like 9:40 ish , and today I feel like DOING SHIT ! Surprisingly , I'm not tired at all ! I think I'm going to completely clean my room , do my laundry , get a haircut and go shopping for some new clothes . ALL IN ONE DAY . XD 
I go all night , I go all night , I make my blood scream , I kiss my fear on the mouth , I kiss my fear on the mouth , I make my blood ... BURN ... I ..... STARVE ! Starve ?... I make the blood scream , I make the blood burn ! I STARVE ! STARVE !! \ 
-Starve , ( < PROPFIRST > Rollins ) 
It's fucking like 4:00 AM How am I not asleep yet ? I open tomorrow ! TODAY ! 
I have to do something exciting tomorrow , I have to go see a new place I've never been to before or something like that , I'm starting to go mad . 
I'M BUYING A GUITAR TOMORROW EVERYBODY !!!! If before I sounded terrible and loud , now I'm going to sound even LOUDER and MOAR TERRIBLE .... ler ? Sure , why not ? TERRIBLLER ! So , pretty much , nobody on my street is safe now , and my roommates are going to hate me EVEN MORE ! 
I wish I knew more stuff :/ 
I need to start listening to a greater variety of music , I have come to realize that I'm stuck in a 90's mindset . Hello bands like Protest the Hero , Between the Buried and Me and The Dillinger Escape Plan . Yeah , you guys don't know what you're missing . 
All the best things in life are aquired tastes . 
Restless . 
Before I go back to school , I need to go on vacation , like , I need to save up some money , buy a plane ticket to maybe Seattle or Florida or some other place , and stay there for three days , an adventure where I don't know anybody . I've been in such a mood to SEE NEW PLACES recently , I think I need to start making more money if I'm gonna make this happen . 
Bored bored BORED if I had more money I'd go do something . 
I didn't count on is the fact that sheer concentrated knowledge of a topic , and the ability to act , reason and emotionally feel according to your knowledge are two very different things . This is going to set me back at least a year . I can't just wake up one day and decide that I'm going to be completely honest with myself , least of all everybody else . 
There are some sick people in this world , there are some SICK people , in this fucking world , I'm scared and disgusted all at the same time oh my god . 
NOOO ICHIGO !! BEHIND YOU !! 
Guy asks a guy if he wants to go get coffee , guy no . 2's thought process : \Sweet 
I have so much thinking to do , it's like I'm behind my world view analysis which happens every two weeks or so , and all I can do is play Xbox , it's like not cleaning your room or doing your laundry for two weeks , or not doing your homework , if you don't take care of it , it gets completely out of hand and you start going crazy . 
Selling out means mellowing your message so that conservative peple won't st < PROPMALE > preaching about how the world is coming to an end while using your work of < PROPMALE > as an example . Effectively transforming that which was into a commercial , marketable work of entertainment . Sometimes , I hate conservatives . 
M o-o -o-m ! He's avoiding my quuuesstionnnss !! X ( 
All my life I've always thought that I was okay with dishonest people , like people that constantly lie about stuff didn't bother me , but it isn't until now that I realize this in fact really annoys me . Perhaps I'm not as tolerant of BS as I've always thought , especially with OBVIOUS dishonesty . Some people lie all the time , and they truly suck at lying . I've grown to have a new appreciation for honesty . 
Would you speak your mind and attest ? \ 
Or would you fall through the cracks , lie flat on your back ? \ 
Or be true to yourself and live life as an outcast ? \ 
I know ! I know ! I know I live life as an outcast ! \ 
-Time Again . 
When you get to the top of the huge mountain you've been climbing all your life , you realize that there was nothing at the top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds . Satisfaction was in the mundane things after all . \ 
Or so say the Meatpuppets , I wouldn't know , my mountain probably reaches all the way to Mars by now , I'm never getting to the top of that bitch . 
The better you get to know a person , the more complicated they are . At least for me , I feel like I have you figured out until we start becoming kinda friends . 
MARCH IS GOING TO BE A BAD MONTH . 
So I read about my astrological sign and ... what balls ! Apparently I'm supposed to be some overly emotional , extremely generous , obsessed with sex , irrational person who desires power and wealth and has no sense of adventure . No wonder I've ignored my horoscope all these years ! 
We just had a guy walk into the store COMPLETELY TRIPPING on some serious shroomz . It took him like forty seconds to come up with a fake name to give me to put into the system too ! :D 
Breakfast today = BLT at Subway and a chocolate chip cookie . Fuck yes people . 
There's such thing as , \Making it sound more complicated than it is\ " . It's always more complicated than it sounds . Two Worlds 2 is a good game . " 
I desperately wanted cigarettes all day , but I held off buying them until now , that's like eleven hours of wanting a cigarette , and after I buy them , I suddenly don't want to smoke . WTF ?!? 
I'm losing my confidence , it's like I just want to give up and run back home , except I have no home to run back to . BALLS ! Never saw this one coming when I got kicked out of my parents ' house right ? Whatever , the need to feel appreciated is for pansies . I GO LISTEN TO UBER LOUD DEATH METAL and SMOKE A CIGARETTE and JUMP AROUND THE KITCHEN IN MY PAJAMAS until I hurt something in my neck . THAT ought to cheer me up ! 
YAY ! GAY PORN ! 
I've just eaten so much < PROPFEMALE > and Jello that I feel like I'm going to get sick . Oh well , if I'm going to throw up , i prefer it happen from overeating < PROPFEMALE > , rather than a fever . 
How can the power of logic prevail , when we have irrational people in charge of everything ? I hate authority , I don't want to be in situations of authority , I don't want to put up with the large ego of somebody with too much authority . 
Sometimes , I wish I had infinite time to think of the perfect thing to say , taking into account the contextual complexity inherent with every unique situation that I find myself having to verbally communicate ideas in . Maybe I didn't require verbal communication to get the correct ideas across after all , you know ? Blah , sometimes , I can be really dense . 
For parents to teach their children to identify with any one ideology , and to brainwash them with the principals of said ideology is the equivalent of child abuse . 
Today , I learned that when people ask for an apology , they don't want to hear the possible multiple reasons for why you did it , they just want an acknowledgement from you in regards to what you did , and an assurance from you that you won't do it again .

When I need to do a 180 degree turn in FPS and TPS videogames , I noticed that I almost always turn to the left . Now I'm going to consciously make an effort to turn to the left only every other time , alternating my 180 turning pattern . 
On the ride home I was all giddy and excited because I was like : ' OH MY GAWD ! HOME ! SPLINTER CELL ! < PROPFIRST > HITCHENS DEBATES ! QUAKE LIVE RERUNS ! AND SPAM ! Somehow , I need to find a way to incorporate of these things into one explosion , and make the explosion ... explode . 
I thought of neo-Molinism when I was thirteen years old , this shows to me that it isn't a great idea that makes for great applause , rather great communication skills enhanced with an adequate vocabulary . It's not like I could exactly explain it to anybody , when all the kids and adults around me had a 30 second attention span . 
All this talk about how we're supposed to survive in a post-religious society , I say we just make one , universal religion . Let's not get ahead of ourselves , religions aren't going anywhere anytime soon . 
It's not what you think , it's how you think . Your thinking process is the method by which you come to your comclusions .

Quake Arena Arcade with some of my best Xbox friends yea yea yea . 
People want to be happy , they know the difference between happiness and suffering , they want to feel the best they're ever felt , better than they've ever felt , and they constantly notice that life makes that difficult and our [ beliefs ] are a response to that circumstance . \

So I've watched all of Battlestar Galactica , and I'm watching ALL OF CAPRICA right now . ALL of the episodes , one night , suck it

Frustrating day at work today . 
It just occurred to me that Stalin had the best KDR ever recorded in history to my knowledge . No wonder everybody hates him so much , mine's usually like 2 , or 1 , or sometimes even like . 74 . 
It hurts you more than it hurts me . \ 
You smile , you knife in my kidney . \ 
The pleasure soaking down your spine , \ 
Your arrogance destroying mine . \ 
Someday , I will break my knuckles ... \ 
On your smug face . \

I have to wake up really early in the morning , and I can't sleep . That's what happens when your normal bed time is usually at 3:00 AM . I'm going to be SO tired tomorrow . 
Apparently , Long Island bouncers don't know how Idaho IDs work . 
Apparently , < PROPMALE > Carrey is a death metal enthusiast . 
I never thought I'd be twenty years old reading a < PROPMALE > Potter book . And before you can make fun of me , I don't care , go jump in a freezing lake full of sharks or something yea ? 
Drama is nice , when it's on TV . Not when it's messing with your head in real life . 
Someday , I will write a book about valid ideas on how to end religious fundamentalism in the world . When I get time , and money . And maybe more education , and if I'm not feeling lazy . SOMEDAY .

Castlevania . Yessss ! 
Masticating on the murdered mind , you take the grain , I take the pain . 
Sometimes , I wish I didn't even exist as something that others are aware of , just like an entity that exists , and just observes everything from every point of view , the only thing I couldn't observe , would be myself , because I would only exist because I acknowledge my existence yea ? That would be sick , I would know SO MUCH STUFF ABOUT EVERYTHING ! And NOBODY would ever know ANYTHING about me ! 
The brainwashed do not know they're brainwashed : religion in a nutshell .

Duke Nukem Forever has been delayed ... again , until June this time . 
All-nighter at the store , again , epic win , I played Metro 2033 all night . It's like a sleepover from back when I was twelve , but even better , because I don't have any friends trying to steal the controller away . 
My job is awesome . I get paid to play video games and flirt with customers . By comparison , your job sucks . 
Is being morbid and cynical , fuck the world . 
My roommate is a ninja . 
What do you mean I hurt your feelings ? I didn't know you had any feelings . 
Maybe people are only so confusing because I make them more confusing than they actually mean to be . Then again , I know I'm pretty confusing at times , as much as I like to pretend that I'm pretty straightforward and easy going . 
Grr , I'm hungry , and I don't know what I want to eat , I'm sick of Ramen noodles . 
You know you're playing a great video game when you've been stuck on the same five square feet of video game land for six hours , and you're still actually playing it . 
I just beat Decay , Part 2 for Xbox , and it's the MOST AMAZING THING EVER . When you beat it , they give you an address to a secret website , and then they give you a code and you use your gamertag and the code that you figured out , to log in and download the entire Decay Part 2 sound track ! It's like a game that you play outside of the game , it's AMAZING .
