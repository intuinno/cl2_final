I hope this weather is finally going to clear up so I can ride my horse and ride the motorcycle with < PROPFIRST > . I've had it with this weather ! 

Waiting for a fun weekend . Its almost here . Live every day as if its your last . 
This computer stuff is addictive . I can't even watch TV anymore ! 
I had a great Easter ! Took Mekelle to church with me and then met my oldest son , his fiancee and Makayla for my birthday lunch . Spent the rest of the day with family and friends in the sunshine . Now back to work tomorrow . 
I had a great day horseback riding in < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and hope to ride tomorrow and the next day before heading down to Gulf Shores for fun in the sun ! 
Fun in the sun ! Layin on the beach ! Gulf Shores here we come !
