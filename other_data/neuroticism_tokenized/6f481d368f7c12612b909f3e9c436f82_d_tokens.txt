still kicking myself hard for breaking the lid to the awesome coffee mug with lid my dad gave me . coffee gets cold before i'm done !

listening to < PROPFIRST > Cash and it's giving me the chills ! 
people who type loudly and aggressively bother me . they just do . 
taking some deeep breaths in preparation for three hours of < PROPMALE > . 
coming up on halloween and I literally have no appetite for anything sweet . this is NOT good . there is a plate of free pumpkin cheesecake bites sitting at the library desk and I could't do it . what's happening ?

oh my god , there is literally a guy talking on two different cell phones across from me in the library right now . he just told one person to hold on and answered the second . not like a call waiting situation . two phones .

Just saw an article on last minute gift ideas , with pictures of a gps , < PROPFEMALE > hoop earrings , and a lego NASA rocket spaceship thing . My eyes instinctively went straight to that lego spaceship .
