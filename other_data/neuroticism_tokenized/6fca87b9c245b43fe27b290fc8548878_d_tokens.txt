I love the Winter X Games . < PROPFIRST > White is the fucking boss . 
Everyone who knows < PROPFIRST > Quinlan should start calling him pookie bear , if only just to mess with him . 
So I decided that just having Demon Days by Gorillaz wasn't enough and I wanted to get Plastic Beach . Find it , download it , all good . There's no album < PROPMALE > , no prob , but then every track is 3:35 in length . Pretty suspicious , so I click the first track . RickRoll'd by some sm < PROPMALE > -ass . But it was pretty funny . 
Today is my eighth day with the same damned migraine , the third day of school already that I've had to miss because of it , and it still won't go away . This shit huuurtss . I like to think I have a high pain threshold , but come on , this is ridiculous >:( 
My nightly medicine cocktail really messed me up , so I am going to have to go to bed now . Hopefully this migraine I've been fighting for eight days will be gone in the morning and I'll be able to return to school tomorrow , hopefully I'll see some of you guys tomorrow ! 
If my migraine isn't gone by Monday , I'm gonna have to move to my back up plan : drinking the blood of first-borns . First-borns , I suggest you start sacrificing to Odin . 
Twas the night after the super bowl , and the steelers fans were butt-hurt . 
Eff this migraine . This is the fucking fourteenth day I've had it now , it is not going away . I'll take a nap , go to bed , try and get some rest to help sleep it off and then when I wake up it's still hanging around . Not fucking cool man .

I find it entertaining when I'm watching the basketball game and the analysts start talking about metrosexuals . Gotta love Cali

 ? down , trying to fall asleep . ( Grammar nazis : comma splice , I fucking know , but I'm don't care . Judge me . ) I was able to fall asleep before the album ende 
 ? d . Radiohead works better than fucking ambien , shit . 
Just got a new fedora ( trilby )

So while he was at school today , I decided to be a douche and get on < PROPFIRST > Quinlan's Last.fm account and add a fuckton of music to his library for him , including Enter fucking Shikari <3 ( that's how it's to be spelled from now on , k < PROPMALE > Suri , Kyle Bishop ? ) , and then change his password for good measure . 
Global warming is this great nation's most serious threat . In adding an extra hour of daylight , we give the sun that much more time to melt icebergs and raise the ocean's water level .

So my mom asked if I'd watched any of my new movies yet . I told her I ad not , and that I needed to get my xbox fixed so I could watch movies on it again .

A while back a came up with a great idea for a religion ( < PROPFEMALE > Methodism ) and as I was lying in bed I came up with a deity for this rad religion : Imits . Imits is our chillest bro , homey to all and the Holy Sharer of Vodka . \ 
I think it's time to get this religion up and going . \ 
And no , I'm not high you ass clowns . 
< PROPFIRST > Bishop & < PROPMALE > Suri , would you classify any select metalcore bands as metalcore royalty ? I would say All That Remains , August Burns Red , and A Day To Remember . I mean , AfuckingA and Enter Shikari are fucking GOOD , but I wouldn't say they've really reached the same level as those other three . \ 
Or is this just a stupid idea I should forget about ?
