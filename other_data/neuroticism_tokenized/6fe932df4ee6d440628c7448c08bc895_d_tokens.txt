I am that girl . I am the library < PROPFEMALE > hiding in Fantasy . I am the circus freak encased in beeswax . 
So little to say but so much time , despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind . Please wear the face , the one where you smile , because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry . 
I've made up my mind , No need to think it over . If i'm wrong I aint right , No need to look no further . This ain't lust , This is love but .

Without you , the eyes gaze , the legs walk , the lungs breathe . The mind churns . The heart yearns . The tears dry without you . Life goes on , but I'm gone . -- Without you .

And they never knew nothing of love . It was before the origin of love . 
Looking for romance ? Come back another day . The heart may freeze or it can burn . The pain will ease if I can learn . There is no future . There is no past . I live this moment as my last . There's only us . There's only this . Forget regret . Or life is yours to miss . No other road . No other way . No day but today . 
I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh . I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away . I keep your photograph , I know it serves me well . I wanna hold you high and steal your pain . -- Broken . 
Just another day . :) 
The world revives ; colors renew , but I know blue . Only blue . Lonely blue . Willingly blue , Without you .

When the rain is blowing in your face , and the whole world is on your case , I could offer you a warm embrace ; to make you feel my love . 
Oh Summer . How I loathe you and your pollen . [ Love you HMT & HP ] <3 
I seem to be a glutton for pain . The stupidest decisions are the ones made by the heart ; I should listen to my mind more often , it's never been wrong . 
All the memories that we've made I threw them all away . There's no need to talk it over . Don't let me get you down . Lets just move on . I am setting you free , cause I don't wanna hurt , no more . I don't wanna make you go through one more rainy day . [ Night . ] 
If only I were British . lol 
This is the story of a girl , Who cried a river and drowned the whole world ! And while she looked so sad in photographs , I absolutely love her , When she smiles . :)

My Stomach hurts . :( At least Friday is here . :D 
Kingdom Plantae . I am so Lazy . Sigh . 
Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor . Reachin ' for the phone cause I can't fight it anymore . And I wonder if I ever cross your mind . For me it happens all the time . It's a quarter after one , I'm all alone and I need you now . Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now . And I don't know how I can do without , I just need you now . 
The darkness you left in my soul . Do we know how much we've lost ? Will the < PROPFEMALE > be shining as bright as before . And as I'm singing this song . Tears well up in my eyes . And I will always wonder . 
Hold my hand while you cut me down . It had only just begun but now it's over now . And your in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold . I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold . I'm tired of trying , when I don't get nothing back . Boy I'm tired . -- < PROPFEMALE >.-- [ Plantae & Headache . ] 
I know that we are young , and I know that you may love me . But I just can't be with you like this anymore , < PROPMALE > . [ Woke up singing Lady Gaga . ] :) 
Each morning I get up I die a little . Can barely stand on my feet . Take a look in the mirror and cry . Lord what you're doing to me . I have spent all my years in believing you . But I just can't get no relief , Lord ! -Somebody to Love . [ Sleep ] 
Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life . Strange , that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to no one . 
Why don't they post the showtimes for movies on Saturday ? At least I know that Cane's will be waiting for me . ;) 
Past the point of no return . No going back now . Our passion-play has now at last begun . Past all thought of right or wrong . One final question , how long should we two wait before we're one ? When will the blood begin to race . The sleeping < PROPMALE > burst into bloom . When will the flames at last CONSUME us ? :D 
I believe in a thing called love . Just listen to the rhythm of my heart . untz untz untz . :P 
Ay , ay , ay , Amor canta y no llores . Porque cantando se alegran cielito lindo los corazones . 
You have brought me to that moment where words run dry . To that moment where speech disappears into silence . Silence ... 
You say my name like there could be an us . I best tidy up my head , I'm the only one in love . I'm the only one in love . Why do you steal my hand whenever I'm standing my own ground . You build me up , then leave me dead . [ I am < PROPFEMALE > Tired . & Hungry ] ily < PROPFEMALE > Trahan . 
So wipe that dirty smile off , we won't be making up . I've cried my heart out . And now I've had enough of love . Go ahead and still my heart to make me cry again . Cause it will never hurt as much as it did then when we were both right , and no one had blame . But now I give up on this endless game . - < PROPFEMALE > . [ Sleep . ] 
I know you haven't made your mind up yet , but I would never do you wrong . I've known it from the moment that we met , no doubt in my mind where you belong . [ Tired . ] 
Wait , do you see my heart on my sleeve ? It's been there for days on end and , it's been waiting for you to open up . Just you baby , come on now . I'm trying to tell you just how I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth ; finally , say that it's always been me . [ Le Tired . ] 
Don't call my name . Don't call my name , < PROPFIRST > . [ Canes . <3 ] 
A jaw dropper , looks good when he walks , is the subject of their talk . He would be hard to < PROPMALE > , but good to catch , and he could change the world with his hands behind his back . [ Daydreamer . ] 
Found myself today singing out your name , you said I'm crazy . If I am , I'm crazy for you . Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here turns me crazy , but it's you who makes me lose my head . [ Got a blue Powerade slush . Why didn't I just get a Coke ? ] 
Right under my feet there's air made of bricks . Pulls me down turns me weak for you . I find myself repeating like a broken tune , and I'm forever excusing your intentions . And I give in to my pretendings . Which forgive you each time Without me knowing . They melt my heart to stone . [ Church . Goodmorning . ] 
Ooh baby love , my baby love . I need you , oh how I need you . But all you do is treat me bad . Break my heart and leave me sad . Tell me , what did I do wrong ? To make you stay away so long . [ The Supremes . ] Oh summer ; You're Hot . ;) 
Stars when you shine , You know how I feel . [ Music . <3 . I can't tell you how I feel with words , but I can with Music . ] 
Wet hair is like spaghetti . I'd insert some lyric but I'm to lazy . [ Goodnight . ] :) 
You hold me without touch . You keep me without chains . I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain . -Gravity . [ Life should be black & white ; yes and no . ] 
Favoritism ain't my thing but , in this situation I'll be glad to make an exception . [ Ugh . It's only Tuesday . ] 
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin . I wish you'd come over , send me spinning closer to you . My oh my , how my blood boils , it's sweet taste for you , strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood . -Crazy for You . [ Hungry . Awards Banquet . Sigh . ]

If you were falling , then I would catch you . You need a light , I'd find a match . \

I sit in the back of a bus watching the world grow old . Watching the world go by all by myself . I took a faith full leap and packed up all my things and all my love and gave it to somebody else . But how do I know if I'll make it through ? How do I know ? Where's the proof in you ? -Soldier . [ The battle with the heart isn't easily won . But it can be won . ]

Have you ever thought about what protects our hearts ? Just a cage of rib bones and some other various parts . So it's fairly simple to cut right through the mess , and to stop the muscle that makes us confess . \

Baby , you've got the sort of hands to rip me apart . And baby , you've got the sort of face to start this old heart , but your eyes are warning me this early morning . That my love's too big for you my love . -Sort of . 
It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song . You can't believe it . You were always singing along . It was so easy , and the words so sweet . You can't remember . You try to feel the beat . -Eet . [ < PROPMALE > Landry is a raging lesbian . lol . ] { With < PROPFEMALE > & Hctr . }

I never loved nobody fully . Always one foot on the ground . And by protecting my heart truly , I got lost In the sounds . I hear in my mind , all of these voices .

And You fasten my seatbelt because it is the law . In your two ton death trap I finally saw . A piece of love in your face that bathed me in regret . Then you drove me to places I'll never forget . And we are so fragile , And our cracking bones make noise , And we are just , Breakable , breakable , breakable girls and boys . - Breakable . 
This is how it works ; You're young until you're not . You love until you don't . You try until you can't . You laugh until you cry . You cry until you laugh , and everyone must breathe . Until their dying breath . -On the Radio . 
Suppose I never ever saw you . Suppose we never ever called . Suppose I kept on singing love songs . Just to break my own fall . -Fidelity . [ I was kicking butt , and then someone decided to text me knocking me off my groove . ] 
You're getting sadder , getting sadder , getting sadder , getting sadder . And I don't understand , and I don't understand . But if I kiss you where it's sore , if I kiss you where it's sore will you feel better , better , better . Will you feel anything at all ? - Better .

You can get with This . Or you can get with ... That . But This is where it's at . :) eee son . Lol

Tick tick tick tick on the watch , and life's too short for me to stop . Oh baby , your time is running out . I won't let you turn around , and tell me now I'm much too proud . All you do is fill me up with doubt . This time baby I'll be bulletproof . -Bulletproof . [ Me so Hungry . ] :)

Love , love hides in a smoky light , and I can never find the truth . Boy , your touches leave me mystified , and I wish I could believe in you . Yes it's all false love and affection . You don't want me . You just like the attention . - I'm not your Toy .

We can fight our desires , but when we start making fires . We get ever so hot , whether we like it or not . They say we can love who we trust , but what is love without lust ?

But gods that have left you will never grace your home . -Bon Idée . 
Spackled some butter over my whole grain bread . Something tastes different , maybe it's my tongue . Something tastes different , suddenly I'm not so young . I'm just a stranger , even to myself . -Die Alone . [ Sigh , why does the weekend have to end ? ]
