Only five more days in Kokomo ... How depressing . :[ Better make them last . :] 

Oh lord . Desperate Housewives makes me laugh out loud . 
Can't wait until I have enough money to get my moped . :] Cars are so overrated . 
I just felt a sudden wave of Brian-sadness . I don't think a day goes by still that I don't think about him . I miss him so much . :[ 
Woohoo ! Relaxation time for < PROPFIRST > . I feel like I have been on my feet for days . 
I feel like befriending all of the < PROPFIRST > Carpenter's on Facebook . Just because . xD 
Just wasted a day of her life doing nothing , and it felt good . 
It's okay ... He's my ex ... 
Yay for unusual sleeping patterns ? Or ... not . 
Yummy Noodles ! :3 
' Is he bold ? ' \No on braver ! \ " ' Is he sweet ? ' \ " Our favorite flavor ! \"" 
Really ? I don't have to do all of these worksheets that take three hours a chop from my life for driving ? I wish I had known that three worksheets ago . :/ 
And now I'm 18.001 years old . Cheers ! :] 
Going to the Galleria ! xD I wish I had more money to spend there . 
No sleeping for < PROPFIRST > since < PROPFIRST > can't risk missing the plane ... x.x 
Someone should just give me a 250cc moped . Like , ' here , < PROPFIRST > , I got this moped for you . ' The most natural thing in the world , right ? 
Hope everyone is having fun getting chubbers . :] 
Pissed . Off . I'm tired of this crap . 
Wants to be social . I hate being stuck with the choices of walking or bicycling . Just shoot me now , yeah ? 
Why is it so difficult to get someone to take an hour to teach me to parallel park ?? This is so frustrating . 
Lost my phone . < PROPFEMALE>'s pictures . :[ I can't believe I lost my phone . 
For those who don't know , I lost my phone . x.x So sorry if I don't text back . 
I hate when you dream about people you're mad at , especially when your dream self ISN'T mad at them . It makes my head hurt , and makes me sad . Stupid dream-people . 
hates getting the car on empty when she's broke . 
Ugggh . Hypocrisy infuriates me . 
Yay for popping my own healthy popcorn and sneaking it into theaters . :D Boo for high fat theater-popped popcorn . 
Club mixes make me want to jam out . 
So , I just bought my very first item off of eBay ever , and I have to say I feel a little more accomplished . x3 
Picture comment frenzy ! :D 
Getting my phone today ! Everybody send me < PROPFIRST > so I can re-add them ? :] 
Yay ! New phone ! :D Time to explore it . 
Haha , I'm starting to like shopping on eBay a little too much . 
I thought I was at the bottom step and fell off the stairs . Not my brightest moment . 
When it's this hard and expensive to get tickets to see my friends perform , they better know that I freakin ' love ' em . Ugh . 
It's days like this one that make me really dislike working . 
What's on my mind ? Migraine . Ouch . 
The end of a break at work has to be one of the saddest moments I experience regularly . :P 
A customer just told me I have a beautiful nose . That's great ? xD 
Mm bacon . :] 
Just spilled teriyaki all over myself at work . This is just wonderful . x.x 
I don't lay down on the ground outside often enough . 
SCORPION ! Aaaa ! Somebody come kill it ! x.x 
Aaa messaging overloooad . 
Okay , so my sister totally got me on board with the < PROPFEMALE > Wars in Concert thing whether she wanted to or not . I'm so going , and I want to get some good seats . ;] 
Got off work early . :D Always a fun thing to do . 
Hot tub . :] 
Went ahead and bought the first volume of Glee . Sonya'll be thrilled . 
Getting the family to watch Glee . :P 
Got a fortune cookie that said my judgement is off . What's with the cookie bashing ? 
Ugh . I get so frustrated with this computer freezing . x.x 
I'm totally a chain gum chewer . x3 
Watching The Blind Side for the first time . Great movie . :] 
Waaa watching Avatar on DVD ! Love this movie ! Favorite . :] 
Oh my goodness I have discovered a new favorite : fried mushrooms from Fiesta Lanes . YUMMM . 
Just got my new swimsuit . :D Really like it . :] 
Just found out the video I've been recording for hours to submit to Glee is worthless . Great . Now I have to rerecord or not submit one at all . :[ 
I totally feel like I can rock this . ;] 
Not so confident this morning . 
Officially CAN'T post my Glee auditions due to inadequate technology . This is just great . 
Part of me really wants to buy a Slap Chop . 
Another customer told me I had a nice nose today . 
I hate being confused . Let's all just be straight up and honest with each other , yeah ? 
Hopefully tomorrow's better . :] 
Just bought Lady Gaga tickets with Gabe on July 26th ! AWESOME ! 
Stupid blackout . I like electricity , thank you . 
Just found an awesome rhinestone-covered whistle necklace at Forever21 . I really wish they had had that when I was still lifeguarding . 
\I'm like Tinkerbell ; I NEED applause to LIVE . \ " -- < PROPFEMALE > 
I'm kind of tired of being cooped up in the house with no car to drive . x.x Someone should definitely rescue me soon before I go insane . :] 
Time to try and sleep . Night all . :] 
Woohoo I get to feel like an actual soprano again ! :] 
Webcams are fun . :]]]] 
Ah ! I can't believe I got to sing with < PROPFEMALE > Wars in Concert . So awesome ! We got to meet the original actor of C3-PO in person before the show !!!! Crazy ! 
Next Tuesday night will be the first Glee episode I will have watched on television as opposed to dvd or Hulu . 
I need to get out today . :] 
Aaaaaa . I hate allergies . D: 
UUUUGGGGGHHHH . Home is supposed to be more relaxing than the rest of the world . FAIL . 
UGH !!! I'm just going to close my Planet Fitness account . I can't deal with this crap . 
I'm really not looking forward to getting my wisdom tooth cut and pulled out in five hours . D: No matter how good everyone keeps telling me the drugs are . Haha . 
Just realized : I've never had stitches before now . 
Why are < PROPFEMALE > Fanning and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > kissing in their new movie ? I was surprised enough that < PROPFEMALE > was dancing around singing in lingerie , now she's kissing other girls ? I'm confused by this . 
And back to work I go ... Hopefully I don't have to talk too much . 
Considering starting to buy my Halloween costume already ... Just to get all of the pieces together ... Hmmmmm . 
I feel like going out and doing stuff . So I think I will . :D 
Relaxing by my pool with Neeeeeely . :]]]] 
Was feeling good until I picked her up . Sheesh . Just . Stop . Talking . 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > , feeling like a nerd . But having fun anyways . :] 
\Well he definitely marches to the beat of his own drummer . ..... Actually I think he makes his own drums . \"" 
My internet's freaking out and it's starting to annoy the hell out of me .. 
My phone's taking a rice bath at the moment after it got attacked by some Caffeine-Free Diet Coke . It works , but just to be sure . So anyway , Facebook me instead of texting . :] 
So I'm thinking American Idol Auditions in < PROPFIRST > , August 11 ? I think I'd be able to go this year ! 
Haha so does anyone want to some with me to < PROPFIRST > for the American Idol auditions ? 
\Raindrops keep falling on my head ... \"" 
Aaa ! < PROPFEMALE>'s head ! Aaaa ! ... True Blood . x.x 
I feel like having a good hug . xP 
Night , everyone . 
Night ! Have to get in some sleep before Warped Tour tomorrow . ;] 
Was up front in the crowd for the All-American Rejects earlier ! The sunburn is totally worth such an awesome day . 
So tired . Time for bed now ? Kthanks . :] 
So I'm not super white anymore . xD Darn sun . 
Aloe < PROPFEMALE > is definitely a godsend . :] 
I already want to go back to Warped Tour . xD Wish they had things like that everyday . :] Only ... less expensive . 
Me : \Mom 
Aaaaa my foot's asleep . Wake up , foot . 
So I've decided that I would definitely be one of the first to die if zombies ever took over the world . 
< PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Who else loves getting paid ? :D 
Going to see < PROPFIRST > Oaxaca in < PROPMALE > on Thursday and then we're off to Lady Gaga next Monday ! I'm so excited ! 
Just saw < PROPFIRST > Oaxaca randomly jogging , freaked out and laid on the horn , then got him in the car and drove around for a bit . xD I love when things like that happen . 
Just walked what seemed like twelve < PROPMALE > ( okay , not nearly that many ) with an umbrella slung over my shoulders carrying four or five Target bags including milk and eggs . < PROPFIRST > Oaxaca carried his by hand , which is amazing . And now we're going to do p90x yoga . We're so intense . 
Uuuugh . Ready to go to wait in line already . Frustrateeeeed . 
Watching Heroes season 1 on Netflix ! Excited , since I've never watched it . 
< PROPMALE>'s her dad ? Whaaaaaa ?! 
< PROPMALE > Quinto ? Um , yeah . :] 
There are so many side characters in Heroes that are some of the main characters in Glee ... 
Hahaha I like my conversations with my friends . 
\It's like swimming but inside-out ! \ " xD " 
Three more episodes of Heroes until the end ! 
Whoa , Heroes ... Cask of Amontillado much ? o.O 
\Want to do a chinese fire drill ? \ " \ " Yes ! \ " \ " GO ! \"" 
The most priceless , memorable moments are the ones that are probably illegal . :] 
Haha now I plan on watching every episode of The Tudors . xD 
I recognized the actor who plays < PROPMALE > Mott from True Blood in the Tudors , and then someone is introduced to the < PROPMALE > as ' < PROPFIRST > Compton!' I love coincidences like that . 
Ugh Seven Pounds why do you have to make me so sad ?! I can never help but cry at the end . D: 
EPCC , why don't you believe that I've been living in El Paso for the past six years ???? I don't feel like paying your stupid out-of-state tuition !! I've been here six years !!!! 
Grrrr stupid WebAssign homework . I don't understand you . :[ 
Finished my WebAssign homework ! < PROPFEMALE > ' Carpenter ' Stokes ftw . :3 
\Babies ! You'll have so many babies ! 400 babies !! \""

< PROPFIRST > and the Giant Peach . You have to love it . Even if you had nightmares about it as a kid . :] 
< PROPMALE > Parkman is in Lost !!! I wish he had his awesome Heroes abilities . 
On the five episode of the first season of Lost ... Have to say , I'm a little bored . 
Aaaaa Swan < PROPFEMALE > !!! Forgot how much I loved the cute music from this movie . ^^ 
When Blockbuster failed me , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Smartt came through ! :] < PROPMALE > season 3 ftw ! 
Serial killers can be so cute when they have babies ! 
I love finding little consistencies in my handwriting . :] 
\Should I invite < PROPFIRST > ? He's so ... tan ... \ " -- Dexter\ 
UGH Blockbuster do you have to fail at having everything BUT the first disc in every season of < PROPMALE > ?! 
\Did you overuse your muse ? Can you borrow one from a friend ? \ " -- ' Advice ' by < PROPFIRST > Ruben\ 
I love it when you comment on someone's status and end up having a conversation with a completely different person via the original person's status comments . 
In the episode where a character from < PROPMALE > was making a tape recording , he described a man as ' 200-220 lbs . ' In another episode when the tape is being played , it has him saying ' 190-200 lbs . ' Hmmm .... Mistake ? I think so . 
Making french toast at four thirty in the morning isn't weird . :D 
KITTYYYYY ! :] 
Okay .... Spastic < PROPFEMALE > . This one's definitely a weirdo . x ] 
I have a new kitten and he/she's insane . I wish I knew what it was so I could name it already . xD 
I got a 100 on my math exam ! Yay ! 
Cat keeps running across the keyboard and causing all sorts of trouble . -.- 
Declaw my cat or animal shelter ? Ugh , this sucks . I don't know what to do . 
Aw Lion < PROPMALE > 2 . <3 :]] 
Does anyone else color code their closet according to ROYGBIV ? c : 
First training session on the new scratching post : SUCCESS . C : And he gets to try Soft Paws once he's big enough as an alternative to declawing . So relieved .

He's so freaking cute when he hangs his paws over the edge of the top of my laptop and looks over like \whatcha doin ? \"" 
I wonder if I could pull together a Blind Mag costume for Halloween ... Hm ... 
It's not as fun when < PROPFEMALE > tries to < PROPFEMALE > over the top of my laptop , being a gigantic pit bull and all . 
Put < PROPMALE>'s new Soft Paws on and he isn't taking them off ! Yay . :] It's funny watching him slide off of furniture when he tries to jump up on it . C : 
I know < PROPMALE>'s crawled under the recliner when I suddenly feel a paw reach out and bat at my heel . C : 
Man , five years ago I was barely starting high school .... Time fliiiiiies . o.o

How am I supposed to graph this function if I have nothing to graph it on , WebAssign ?? I don't want a lower grade just because you won't let me answer . :[ 
Corn maze tonight ? Who wants to go ? C : 
I wish I could like the fact that people like something . Like a little sub-button or something . 
Can't understand what he's saying half of the time , but I still like getting those phone calls . <3 c : 
My tummy hurts . >.< 
I hate when I'm forced to make conversation with people I don't know when I'm obviously not making an effort to keep a conversation going . It's awkward ! \ 
Feeling so antisocial today . :P 
< PROPFEMALE > Carpenter surprised me last night by buying Rent for me on dvd . c : Looooove it .

< PROPMALE > in drag . Wow . 
Can't sleep , and now I'm afraid that if I do fall asleep I won't wake up in time for class ... At least I don't work so I can take one hell of a power nap later ? 
I love that you push the same buttons on your phone to text ' kiss ' as you do to text ' lips . ' 
I feel like such a stalker when I like something immediately after the person posted it . I just happened to see it , I swear ... x.x \

Still haven't gotten my refund for having to pay out-of-state tuition ... And now they're saying they sent it and I have to drive all the way to Valle Verde campus to fill out some ridiculous form to have them send it AGAIN . Stupid EPCC . Just give me back my money . 
I feel like cake ... Or IHOP . One of these needs to happen . c : 
There're a lot of songs on Nip/Tuck that they play at Old Navy ... Somehow this seems inappropriate ... 
I have such an urge to go camping in some woods right now . 
Boring day . Off to school , soon . d : 
< PROPMALE > and I saw an advertisement for the McRib on Facebook fifteen minutes ago , and now we both have a McRib . That , my friends , is called effective advertising . cx

Bad day today . Hopefully it brightens up at least a little . 
Worst day I've had in a few months . Aren't you supposed to be happy when school lets out ? 
So Thursday at work someone else asked me if I had had a nose job ... That's the second time .. \ 
Fascination with my nose at work confuses me . x.x

Never realized that < PROPFEMALE > Rowlands ( The Notebook , Skeleton Key ) was in Paulie . C : I love her . And < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Eisenberg . She's freaking adorable . :D 
Going to donate blood in a bit . C : Yay for O- . 
What to do , what to do ... -.- 
When I got home tonight < PROPMALE > wasn't waiting for me at the door , so I ran around the house for half an hour calling for him , thinking he'd run to me . When he didn't , I got scared he was outside and ran around the block looking for him with my parents . Found him two doors down after we had circled the block and then he bolted underneath the table on our patio . \ 
I was so scared . :[ But at least we found him . :] 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everybody ! C :

So ... I had this awesome dream last night where I brought Optimus Prime back to life and then was granted with unlimited super powers for my service . Whatever I could imagine , I could do . I was flying , mostly . But I also made my hair turn red . I was a little disappointed when I woke up and it was still blonde . d : 
This on again , off again internet I've had for the past twenty-four hours is really annoying me . -.-
