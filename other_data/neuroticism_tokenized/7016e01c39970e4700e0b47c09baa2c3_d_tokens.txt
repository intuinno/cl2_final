I honestly believe that < PROPMALE > Saget is the sickest individual on the planet . I made the mistake of watching his standup special . 

Obama Cult of Personality : Please curb the enthusiasm . 
Call me crazy , but dear Congressman/Senator , READ THE < PROPMALE > ! 
Sorry < PROPFEMALE > . Apparently I along with the other protesters and demonstrators at all the town \hells\ " are nothing more than ignorant fascists and Nazis . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Pelosi ! "

Depressed that I still have 2 books to read by Thursday and STILL have to go to work .... * sigh * 
Just glad it's Saturday . No more politics till Monday morning . 
Just finished the last of summer reading . 
Planning to watch District 9 tonight . No work ! 
Watched District 9 . Good film . Very different and unique approach to Sci-fi . Now back to reading Infinite Jest . 
Off of work . Time to unwind , eat ice cream , and get back to Infinite Jest . 
If I'm not doing anything else , I'm reading Infinite Jest . 
50 pages left of Infinite Jest ! 
Finished with Infinite Jest . Best book I have ever read . 
Finishing homework and reading < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s \Consider the Lobster\ " and < PROPFIRST > Becks \ " Arguing with Idiots \"" 
New South Park episodes . 
I hate application fees and being required to print out 21 PAGES FOR 1 COLLEGE !!!!! 
BRUTAL LEGEND 
Home at 12:23 a.m. Gotta love movie theaters . 
Have found that my only motivation to do anything anymore is just to not be bothered . 
Borderlands is ... fun , exciting , hilarious , addictive ! 
Doing homework while the Dark Knight soundtrack is playing in the background . Concert level sound of symphony . It's great . 
All along the watchtower , princes kept the view . While all the women came and went , barefoot servants , too . Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl , Two riders were approaching , the wind began to howl 
Close game but , ROLL TIDE !!!!! 
Glad that college essays are FINALLY over . 
I didn't have a < PROPMALE > to do this yesterday so ..... ROLL FREAKIN ' TIDE !!!!!!! SEC TITLE XXII ! See ya in Pasadena Texas ! 
Thanks to all of my well wishers . The day was excellent . 
Up in the Air is absolutely fantastic . Possibly the best film of 2009 ! 
Let the Midnight Special , shine a light on me ! I love CCR . 
A little anxious over the AP Gov quiz tomorrow . 
OMG !!!!! < PROPFIRST > KIFFEN JUST QUIT TENNESSEE AND IS NOW THE NEW HEAD COACH OF USC !!!! 
< PROPFIRST > is back ! 24 season premiere part II tonight 8/7c . 
Massachusetts has a < PROP < PROPFEMALE > LE > to once again be the state that starts a revolution . Win one for the American People < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
The spell has temporarily been broken ! I would have never thought that this early in my lifetime that I would see a Republican elected to the Senate from the State of Massachusetts . Congratulations to my friends in < PROPFE < PROPFEMALE > LE > who voted for < PROPFIRST > Brown . Well done . Now we need to hope and pray that he lives up to what he was elected for and if he does , look out DC . < PROPFE < PROPFEMALE > LE > just started a whole new train rollin ' . 
I have finally come to the conclusion of why I like the idea of individuals like a < PROPFIRST > Brown or a < PROPFEMALE > Palin in politics , I just love to watch the Left squirm . 
On the State of the Union : Broad visions ? Good . Specific plans ? Somewhat . Jabs at the opposition ? Yes . Blame Bush ? Of course . Use of the first person more than 40 times ? Absolutely . References to previous election campaign ? Definitely . Overall , it seems like he hit all his < PROPMALE > points . 
I believe that there is no more beautiful sound on the face of this planet than a bagpipe . 
Is anyone else bothered by the new \look\ " of Facebook ? " 
I find the CPUSA to be extremely sad , delusional , and ... in a sick sort of way , funny . 
Shutter Island = AWESOME !!! 
I can not wait to be done with all AP English essays . 
There is no worse feeling in the world than returning to a regular school schedule after spending 4 days doing something that you love . < PROPMALE > YMCA Youth Leg . 2010 , best conference ever . 
I took my esteemed cousin's advice and bought some excellent pieces of literature that I can now < PROPFIRST > half-way off my Book Bucket List . ( The Divine Comedy , A Brave New World , Pride and Prejudice ) 
I officially HATE the FAFSA and the morons ( i.e. the Federal Government ) that wrote it . And I hate the morons who helped plunge the entire country into a depression . So I say Thank you all for making college nearly impossible to attend . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > much . ( Btw , didn't the President promise college students something ? Something about \loans\ " and such ? ) " 
Can't wait for the lawsuits to start rolling on Obamacare . This is the greatest challenge to the fundamentals of the Republic since 1861 . I don't think that there are very many who will take this one sitting down . This is just the beginning of something greater . However it turns out , I don't think it will be pretty . 
\Is there anybody out there ? \ " -Pink < PROPMALE > " 
I am extremely disappointed with the new season of South Park . Come on guys ! Where are your heads ? 
\Yeah Put out the spotlights one and all let the feelin ' get down to your soul . The music's so loud You can hear the sound reachin ' for the sky and tearin ' up the ground . \ " -Bad Company " 
Watching 1st Round of NFL Draft . Way to go Oklahoma . Now PLEASE let < PROPMALE > McClain not get picked until San < PROPFIRST > gets up , 
NOOOOOOOOOOOO !!! The McClain is now a Raider ? NOOOOOOO !!!!!!!! 
Goodbye < PROPFIRST > Bauer . Goodbye 24 . You shall be greatly missed . 
30 Days and counting till CONA . 
Preparing for another long night at work . 
Is it a problem that I work at a movie theater and there is absolutely NOTHING I want to see ? 
Having fun playing with my new MacBook Pro :) 
I just realized that in 5 days , I'll be CONA bound . And I also realized I haven't packed anything ... 
I know this is a somewhat redundant status , but I am in love with my computer . 
Does anyone else find Celtic music , particularly bagpipes and < PROPFEMALE > whistles , to be some of the most moving in the world ? 
I'm SOOO glad I'm not working the Eclipse midnight show . 
I've discovered I have a bad habit . Staying up till 2:00 am and not getting up before noon . Life is almost perfect . 
8 hours of Eclipse yesterday , 8 hours of Eclipse today . The road goes ever , ever on . 
Sun tans are overrated . 
Ready for Blue Ridge . See you there ! 
Got home at 8 this morning and the upstairs air-conditioning is out . It feels like < PROPFIRST > Hall up here . 
To take a < PROPFEMALE > bit of artistic license with a < PROPFIRST > Strait song , \Tell me somethin ' bad about CONA . How those Blue Ridge Mountains smell in the wind . Tell me somethin ' bad about CONA . So I don't have to go back where I belong once again . \"" 
Bentley for the Republican candidate ? Really ? BENTLEY ? 
Quote of the Day from Bama Bound Orientation : \Would you be comfortable if your roommate has \ " relations\ " while you are in the dorm ? \"" 
Just watched the documentary Thrilla in Manila . Wow . I like boxing and I love < PROPFIRST > Frazier but that was unbelievably brutal . 
Despicable Me is hilarious . \It's so fluffy !! \"" 
Have now seen Inception twice . Extremely cool film . 
I've just gotten the turkey with Inception . 
Why can't football season start already ? 
I'm having more fun than any individual ought to be . 
Am I the only person that likes Shark Week , just not enough to CONSTANTLY comment about it on the internet ? 
Taking the UA Alcohol < PROPMALE > . Course . Wow . They weren't kidding about the time requirements . 
I have decided to spend the rest of my evening by watching Reservoir Dogs . 
Aliens is perhaps the greatest Sci-fi/Action film ever . 
Skype , willclayton15 . There , I have finally submitted to technology . 
Last night sleeping in my own bed . Move in is at 10:00 am . 
Officially moved in . 
Torrential downpour in Tuscaloosa . So much for that cookout . 
So far so good . Day 2 complete . 
God bless < PROPFEMALE > ! 
So glad that my first class on MWF is at 10:00 am . I get to it this morning and .... cancelled for today . 
To my friends here at UA , I would love to start up a poker game . Let me know if you're interested at all ( text , call , whatever ) . 
< PROPFIRST > is fun , if you can get through it . 
I find it hilarious that I'm like the only person in my 40 person Early British Lit . Class that actually likes Beowulf ( as a character and a story ) . 
Laundry time . And more reading . 
I love rediscovering good music from years past . 
Taking a two hour nap is awesome . 
Still have about 20 more pages of < PROPFIRST > to read by 11:00 am . Books , books , books , and books . Words to live by everyday . 
I thought the point of college was to be AWAY from home . So why is everyone driving home over the weekend ? 
Am I the only boxing fan left in my generation ? 
College is a lot easier than everyone made it out to be . 
Just bought < PROPMALE > Fink on iTunes for $5 . Who would have thought that of all places iTunes would have it ? 
I find it somewhat difficult to write a response paper on House in regards to Socrates when I never watched an episode of House until this assignment . 
It is so unbelievably hot in Tuscaloosa . Why can't the weather be agreeable ? 
Paper # 4 of my first semester due tomorrow . My first essay of the semester is due Tuesday . 
\Got to remember I'm not here to stay . I'm looking forward to a brighter day . Got to remember I'm not here for long . I'm just livin ' in my temporary home . \ " -GVB " 
Movie night begins in 30mins . 
I wonder what my friends in < PROPFEMALE > do on Friday nights while the rest of the country is enjoying football ... 
For the record , < PROPMALE > Saban : Gamechanger is a very fun and interesting documentary . Definitely a must see for Alabama fans and for fans of good coaches in general . Also , it's going to do marvels for recruiting . 
Until about 5mins ago I forgot about the AU vs . MSU game . Now I know what I'm doing tonight . Fig < PROPMALE > vs < PROPFIRST > Mullen . I think it will be fun . 
Pen State fans already parading around campus . This ought to be entertaining . 
Little Italy , you are my food salvation ! 
My high school apparently got creamed again in football . That's just hilarious . 
Can we get another score please ? 
Even from nearly a mile away , I could clearly hear Rammer Jammer from the dorm room . Roll Tide . 
Listening to Penderecki while checking facebook and the news is inspiring . 
Just got back from the student panel for the gubernatorial debate . Wow . I was laughing while watching so as not to cry over the absolutely AWFUL candidates in this election . Both of those guys make < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > look like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , geez . WHY CANT THERE BE A < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > TIE IN ALABAMA !???!?!?!?!?!? 
To all my friends in Alabama , I know that Glee comes on tomorrow at 7:00 pm , but I'm also going to be on WVUA TV at 7:00 pm with a student panel on the Gubernatorial Debate held last Thursday . 
Well , that was interesting . Some of my responses didn't make the final cut , yet I'm pleased with the overall program and how the panelists represented themselves . 
< PROPFEMALE > Spears Glee episode ? That's going to be hilarious . Now all they have to do is < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera and the circle will be complete . 
Math 110 . You and I are eventually going to like each other . 
Bored , so listening to music . 
This has the makings of a perfect day . Alabama won . If Auburn loses , perfect day . 
So much for the perfect day . 
< PROPMALE > White , you make every Saturday memorable . What unbelievable play-by-play and insight . 
J . E . T . S . Jets , Jets , Jets !!!!!!!!!! 
Bears . Packers . ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL !?!?!?!?!? 
I love watching those two teams play . I win if either one of them wins . DAAA BEARS !!!!! 
Finally got the paper into a format I liked . 
Glee was awesome and the show that comes on after it , Raising Hope , is hysterical ! 
Every time my Blount class meets , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > films somehow get brought up . 
Daily routine : Wake up , go to class , eat , go to class , listen to < PROPFIRST > Finebaum , relax , eat , do work , go to bed . Currently on step 5 .

Re-watched this season's episodes of Glee . Britney/Brittany is the most fun , Grilled Cheesus is the most well written and serious . 
Still writing my English paper . 
Yay . Finally satisfied with my paper and have faithfully submitted it to Turnitin.com Some might say I am mad for spending this much time on this paper . I would say they are right . 
Just watched this week's episode of Glee . < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ? I approve . ( Nerds have to stick together . But seriously dude , Na'vi ? Come on . ) 
Just watched The Mothman Prophecies . Terrible screenplay , well directed . 
Take my hand , let me stand where no one stands alone . Cool song . 
The BSG of my generation is still one of the most compelling shows ever to grace television . 
Does anyone else agree with me that Ole Miss ' new mascot ought to have been Admiral Ackbar rather than a Black Bear ? The Admiral makes a lot more sense . 
Tier 1 rocks . Move over COD .

The South Park episode tonight , omg . THAT WAS HYSTERICAL !!!!!!! 
Good morning USA ! 
The Social Network lived up to its hype , and then some . Very good film . I will have to see it a few more times . 
Finally back in Tuscaloosa . The mountains around Gatlinburg and east Tennessee were beautiful . Fun football game as well , even if the UT student section started an \FU Bama\ " chant right before the second half . " 
I love hypocrisy . It makes the world go round . 
Seriously ? This was on my facebook ads section . Way to go < PROPMALE > ! \

I can't get < PROPMALE > Horror out of my head . Why do those songs have to be so damn catchy ? 
Math 110 , I won't miss you . 
Woah , the latest Wheel of Time installment was just released . I know what I'm doing for the next few days !!! :) 
I did not vote . 
FOX is calling the KY Senate race for < PROPFIRST > . 
Megyn < PROPFIRST > makes watching the returns on FOX a little more tolerable . 
Feeling a little sentimental , so I bought a few songs that I love from growing up and still do . It is true what they say , you don't sell songs in the music business . You sell moments . I'm diggin ' the moments . 
I watched the sun come up today . It was so beautiful that I had a worship moment . I never miss a sunset , but a sunrise ... now that brought tears to my eyes . 
I have finished Towers of Midnight . My task for this weekend is now complete . 
< PROPFIRST > Strait , why do I love your music so ? I really ought to live in Texas . 
Does listening to sad , pitiful songs make me a depressed individual or a hopeless romantic ? 
Now for an hour of Math 110 ... errr ... facebook and internet . 
Ok . Time to catch up on Glee . 
Woaah ! What the heck ? That was unexpected . 
Ok . I was pleased . Good writing from Glee this week . 
South Park , hurry up . 
n Even though I'm happy Bama won , I do think < PROPMALE > McElwain uses NCAA 11 for his playcalling . Seriously , why do some of his plays look like Xbox football ? 
$18.04 left in Dining Dollars LOL 
I am tired of HP filling up my news feed . 
Just finished watching The < PROPFEMALE > . Fantastic work of film . 
I've got a headache and the damn acetaminophen bottle won't open . I'm about ready to smash the bottle with a sharp object ( preferably a battleaxe if I can find one ) to get this stupid thing open . 
Thanks to < PROPFIRST > LaDuke for turning me onto The Civil Wars . 
< PROPFIRST > Pharaoh is now my favorite cast member of SNL . His impressions are incredible .

Finished my English essay . Now one last thing to do before bed . 
I think the British < PROPMALE > family is incredibly interesting . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Mirren for causing me to take a renewed interest in the monarchy . 
Ditto the Thanksgiving statuses . 
Dear Everyone : I'll just go ahead and say this and let you all in on a little secret , I hate Auburn . Period . That is all . 
I was told that Auburn actually sang a rendition of Rammer Jammer at the end of the game . First , it was computers . Next , it was English papers . Now , it's other people's songs and chants . Is there anything they won't steal ? 
Anyone else ever have the < PROPFEMALE > to laugh maniacally for no reason save for the joy of laughing ? 
Now I know why it's called Dead Week . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Tedesco < PROPMALE > Culbert Please stop filling my alerts with fracking Cabinet position pictures !!!! Thank you . 
Alright then . Michigan State it is . Capital One Bowl in < PROPMALE > .

It never fails that when cosmic activity occurs , it's cloudy outside . Eclipse fail . 
Finished watching True Grit for the second time . 2 thumbs way way up !! 
Nice . Good win Notre Dame . Go < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm admitting to watching about half a season of Gossip Girl with my sister . I can't believe the target audience is 15-25 . I can barely even suspend disbelief and buy into watching 23 and 24 year olds playing 16 and 17 year olds that not only get into clubs but drink , have plenty of sex , and still find time to go to high school . 
One down . 84 to go . 
This is hilarious . Who would have thought that WRs can't catch balls and DBs have hands ? Maybe they should change positions . 
I think the defenses got their feelings hurt when everyone talked about the \offensive juggernauts\ " that are Auburn and Oregon . " 
One more class , then done for the day . 
Well tonight was interesting to say the least . 
< PROPMALE>'s Speech , still fantastic . 
Looks like I'm going to get my wish , Bears Packers showdown for the NFC Championship . Either way , I win . 
Dare I say I don't really care who wins in the Jets Pats game ? 
Just saw an ad for the Grammys this year . I have not cared so little about that award show in a long time . I'll stick with the Globes , Emmys , and the Academy . 
My man , Giamatti . 
Why do people in the film industry feel the need to read off a laundry list of every single person they ever knew in their careers ? 
Finally , a dead-on pick from the HFP . Well done Mr. Firth . 
Damnit Social Network . 
Original Dragon Ball Z episodes posted on Hulu ? Heck yes . 
The Fourth Kind is one of the worst movies I've ever seen . 
I am here to officially say that I hate the snow/ice day we had last week . I ordered my textbooks a week ago and they still haven't come in thanks to the weather . Classes ought to be fun . 
Yay ! More textbooks are in . Now I don't have to worry about sending exasperated emails . 
Does anyone have a copy of Apocalypto I could burrow ? It's the one < PROPMALE > Gibson film I haven't seen . 
Just finished watching the < PROPFEMALE > Fisher HBO special : Wishful Drinking . I really enjoyed it . It had some really interesting info on \Hollywood inbreeding\ " and occasional moments of wild humor . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Krauss + Union Station make every moment awesome . 
\ I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in . \"" 
Pleased that the Packers one , very disappointed in Chicago's offensive performance . Well , I should say I'm disappointed in Cutler's performance . Thanks a lot there < PROPFIRST > . 
Dear ladies , I appreciate the effort but leggings do not constitute as a viable substitute for pants . Especially when it is raining . 
State of the Union Address for Real : RahRah , Clap Clap , Stand-Up , Sit-Down , Repeat for 1.5 hrs . 
Now that the President has finished his say , it's time for my man < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Booyah ! 
Atta boy < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . ROLL TIDE !!!!! 
I really like this new American Idol panel . Who knew that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > would be this good as a judge . 
It's been really fun watching as the < PROPMALE>'s Speech slowly keeps picking up at the box office . After starting out so slow , it's now beating out new releases on the weekends and deservedly so . Someone ought to write a piece on how this film has really taken off and over with viewers all over . 
Sick . Lovely . 
Feeling a little better . Just trying to get more liquids a little at a time . 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > for keeping me company . 
Music really does make everything better . 
< PROPMALE > Paisley , you're a genius . 
\Do the Creep . \ " LOL " 
Just spent the last hour going through the history of football , both college and NFL . Gotta say , my teams have been some of the most dominant and legendary programs in history . 
Quick question for everyone ( particularly those of you who keep up with the news ) , has anyone else noticed the lack of women in these Egyptian protests ? The women were < PROPMALE > participants in the Iranian protests , but there is a noticeable lack of women in these ... curious . 
< PROPFEMALE > Krauss+Union Station while writing a paper ? Absolutely . 
One more class , then time to pass out . 
I'm curious as to what really set off these allegedly un-expected/coordinated uprisings in the Middle East . Economics aside , there is bound to be something else at play here . 
Apollo 13 has a great soundtrack 
Why must we go to class today with frozen roads ? O well . I guess we only get national championship's off . 
Justified . Good tv show . 
Once Upon a Time in < PROPFEMALE > , pretty good . Very long , but good . 
Black Eyed Pies = must underwhelming half-time show . I actually changed the channel . 
That's the game !!!!! Green Bay has done it !!!!!! 
I can't wait for the < PROPFEMALE>'s Game episode . ATTA WAY GREEN BAY !!!!!!!! 
Just going to start the speculation/rumor-mill early as to who next year's Superbowl Half-Time Show performer ought to be ( since this year was awful ) . 1 ) ACDC 2 ) The Eagles 3 ) Lady Gaga 4 ) The Glee-cast . \ 
Anyone else know who is decent enough/popular enough to pull it off without pulling out too many geriatrics ? 
British Parliament is the most entertaining governing body I've ever soon . 
\Sweet dreams are made of this ; who am I to disagree ? \ " -Eurythmics " 
Ok , these temperature swings are driving my sinuses crazy . 
Just saw both trailers for this Battle : Los < PROPFEMALE > movie ... the trailers are great < PROPMALE > , not sure how the movie itself will be . 
Finally got a haircut ; no more Shaggy from Scooby-Doo . 
Christmas music in February ? Why not ? 
I love great singers . Always have , always will . 
I must admit , as an avid fan of the < PROPFIRST > Finebaum Show , I didn't believe the man who called in and said he poisoned the trees ... 
The REALLY sad thing about the Toomers Trees ? Now they're probably going to hold a freakin ' memorial ceremony and possibly make a plaque in their memory .... * sigh * 
Really REALLY loving the hate right now . To all other Bama fans and students who are being unfairly targeted , Roll Tide . 
Feeling better now . 
Revisiting some old < PROPMALE > Petty classics . Good stuff . 
For those about to rock , we salute you . 
Awesome basketball game . Roll Tide . 
I want to go to the Holy Land . Scratch that , I NEED to go to the Holy Land . 
Walt Whitman , you're driving me crazy 
Wait .... wait .... the Rock is back on WWE ? Finally .... THE ROCK HAS COME BACK !!!! 
It's just a shot away ... 
Worst basketball game I've ever seen , but ROLL TIDE 
Woah . Oprah doesn't look too good tonight . 
And of course , they always drag out < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > . 
I HATE it when they do those \camera effects of dead actors heads on someone else's body . \"" 
What is Hollywood's obsession with my generation's narcissism , nihilism , and superficiality ? 
Ok Oscars , let's hurry this thing up . GET ON WITH IT ALREADY !!!! 
YES !!!!! Well done < PROPMALE > Hooper , and thankfully the Academy shows they still have a < PROPFEMALE > shred of credibility 
Anyone willing to fill me in on Youth Leg over the weekend ? I'm desirous for details . 
< PROPMALE > Firth . Check 
Let's go < PROPMALE>'s Speech . 
For the record , I might scream if KS doesn't win . 
YES YES YES YES YS YES YES YES YES YES YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I find it humorous watching < PROPFEMALE > Portman in Episode 3 , just after she won an academy award for best actress 
How skillful the hands of the artist ... 
Reflecting a bit on the Oscars , < PROPMALE > Brand+Helen Mirren and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > were the best presenters of the show . 
HAHAHAHA !!! < PROPFIRST > Dye jr. arrested in Indianapolis today . Whoops ! 
Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair , this masterpiece hangs in its place ... 
Islam , Islam , Islam . Islam , Islam , Islam . So much Islam . Islamic overload . I really need to watch Kingdom of Heaven to balance it all out . 
Still can't believe that I actually won an open election . 
Just woke up from a glorious amount of 16 hours asleep . Great weekend . Roll Tide . 
Miley < PROPMALE>' SNL episode is probably the worst I've seen in a long LONG time . 
\I forgot my mantra\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Hall " 
Wait ... Snooki is going to be a guest < PROPFEMALE > on RAW next week ? And here I thought this show was < PROPFEMALE > ting to get better again . 
I voted . 
Q : How much coke did < PROPFIRST > Sheen do ? \ 
A : Enough to kill 2 1/2 Men . 
Glee ... that was unexpected . 
UAB basketball = everything the analysts and pissed of Colorado fans said about them . 
The Ghost Writer is such a great film . Say what you want about < PROPMALE > Polanski , but the man knows how to make great movies . 
Thanks Louisville . You let me down . 
At least Kentucky sneaks on through . 
Thanks MSU . Dumb penalties ruined THAT part of my bracket as well . 
Dammit Tennessee . Can anyone say choke central ? 
Something tells me that < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is done at TN . 
Thanks Georgetown . The one upset that I DON'T pick ..... I should just stick with football . 
NFL , if you don't resolve your ridiculous squabbling with players , you're seriously going to piss me off . I love football , and I want to be able to watch it on Mondays and Sundays , as well as Saturdays . 
Heheheheh . \ 
MARCH 19 , 2011\ 
OBAMA : ' Today we are part of a broad coalition . We are answering the calls of a threatened people . And we are acting in the interests of the United States and the world ' ... \ 
MARCH 19 , 2003\ 
BUSH : ' American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger ' ... 
Notre Dame , you let me down ... BIG TIME . 
I'm done . I'm just done . 
< PROPFEMALE > Square Garden , get ready for Alabama . The Tide is rising ! 
I finally have a little consolation for my NCAA Men's bracket being a bust . My school is playing in the NIT semi-finals , and my Women's NCAA bracket is nearly perfect . 
Spider-Man 1 and 2 ? Genius . Spider-Man 3 ? What happened ? 
Finished the essay . Now sleep . 
I can't watch . 
ROLL TIDE !!!!! 
Is there anything that can take away from my enjoyment of the Alabama win ? < PROPMALE > Dilfer's man love for Cam < PROPMALE > . 
Amadeus is a fantastic film , and the music is gorgeous . 
Real Sports with < PROPMALE > Gumble ... interesting pieces on the underside of collegiate athletics , but terrible round-table discussions ( lets pay players above the table ) . Come on . 
Wichita St. has this . They're too good beyond the arc . We had a good run and at least will lose to the NIT champions . 
Doctor Who is such a great show . 
EXTERMINATE !!!! EXTERMINATE !!!! 
Now onto season 2 
Frosted Mini Wheats Littles are incredibly delicious .
