time is a companion that goes with us on a journey . it reminds us to < PROPFEMALE > each moment , because it will never come again . what we leave behind is not as important as how we have lived . 
we will fight or we will fall till the angels save us all . We are young , we have heart Born in this world as it all falls apart We are strong we dont belong Born in this world as it all falls apart 
say what you want , think what you want , i don't care . but i admire the < PROPMALE > brothers .

Being sick over a three day weekend ? sucks . being sick during school ? priceless . NOT 
i like it on the kitchen counter 
Who do you think you are ? Runnin ' ' round leaving scars Collecting your jar of hearts Tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold From the ice inside your soul Don't come back for me Don't come back at all 
is kiiiiinda freaking out . A LOT ! 
back from the fair , had an awesome time with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > !!! :D 
God is bigger than the air I breathe , the world we'll leave . God will save the day and all will say my glorious , my glorious . 
went to a haunted house , through a corn maze , jumped on a pumpkin bounce , slept over < PROPFEMALE > ' < PROPFEMALE>' Ferrari's house , and was a 50's girl for all hallow's < PROPFEMALE > . sounds like a good weekend to me :) 
< PROPFEMALE > walked on broken glass . Sleeping Beauty let a lifetime pass . < PROPFEMALE > fell in love with a beast . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > chose a common theif . < PROPFIRST > walked on land for love . Snow White barely escaped a knife . It was all about blood , sweat , and tears because love means facing your BIGGEST fears . We come to love not by finding a perfect person , but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly . 
“This is my wish for you : Comfort on difficult days , smiles when sadness intrudes , rainbows to follow the clouds , laughter to kiss your lips , sunsets to warm your heart , hugs when spirits sag , beauty for your eyes to see , friendships to brighten your being , faith so that you can believe , confidence for when you doubt , courage to know yourself , < PROPFEMALE > to accept the truth , Love to complete your life . ” 
They said women would never vote . They said the titanic would never sink . They said man would never fly . We sometimes trust the wisdom of unwise people . Cancer can't be cured today , but tomorrow marks a new beginning . Dare to hope , and to believe 
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag , drifting through the wind wanting to start again ? Do you ever feel , feel so paper thin like a house of cards , one blow from caving in ? You just gotta ignite , the light , and let it shine Just own the night like the 4th of July 
my sister is home for thanksgiving !! :D <3 
STAND was SO MUCH FUN !!!! Thanks < PROPFIRST > Geiger for inviting me !!!! :D 
if you're going to lie , lie to rihanna , because she loves it and i don't . 
It's a beautiful night , we're lookin ' for somethin ' dumb to do . hey baby , i think i wanna marry you <3 :) 
Dear Mrs. Copley , \ 
Thank you for getting me & just about everyone in chorus sick ! :) \ 
NOT . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
me 
I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I wanna do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven’t got 
Please pray for my dad who is recovering from sugery & had to stay overnight at the hospital <3 
Dad is home from the hospital :) 
I just want to thank the ppl from my mother's small group for bringing over dinner these past 2 nights . it reminds me there are still truly good people in the world <3 
There's only two people whose ever died for me Laid down their lives just so I could be free They both went through hell bared crosses and shells And both got back up again after they fell They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces God only knows where we'd be without SOLDIERS & JESUS <3 
Cause you had a bad day You're taking one down You sing a sad song just to turn it around You say you don't know You tell me don't lie You work at a smile and you go for a ride You had a bad day The camera don't lie You're coming back down and you really don't mind You had a bad day , You had a bad day 
Hangin ' out , down the street , the same old thing , we did last week . And not a thing to do , but TALK to you . We're all alright , we're all alright ! Hello Wisconsin !! < PROPFEMALE > Holton :D 
I'm goin ' home , gonna load my shotgun Wait by the door and light a cigarette If he wants a fight well now he's got one And he ain't seen me crazy yet He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll Don't that sound like a real man I'm going to show him what a little girls made of GUNPOWDER AND LEAD :D 
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons Finally content with a past I regret I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness For once I'm at peace with myself I've been burdened with blame , trapped in the past for too long I'm movin ' on <3 
God speaks in the silence of the heart . Listening is the beginning of prayer . <3 
Our houses are protected by the good Lord & a gun , you might see ' em both if you show up here not welcome , son . 
Seriously ? It's only the first day of english . This assignment is really stupid . 
I get lost in the beauty of everything i see The world ain’t as half as bad as they paint it to be . If all the sons , if all the daughters stopped to take it in , well then hopefully hate subsides & love can begin . Come home , come home Cause I’ve been waiting for you for so long , for so long . All i see is you and me the fight for you is all I’ve ever known , So come home <3 
pride & prejudice <3 
And while < PROPFEMALE > and her < PROPMALE > did live happily ever after , the point gentlemen , is that they lived . 
is sick . yayyyy !!! NOT . 
after monday & tuesday even the calendar says W.T.F. 
Does anybody hear her ? Can anybody see ? Or does anybody even knows she's going down today Under the shadow of our steeple With all the lost and lonely people Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me Does anybody hear her ? Can anybody see ? 
Talent is God-given , be humble . Fame is man-given , be grateful . Conceit is self-given , be careful . <3

Through it all I've made my mistakes I stumble and fall but I mean these words I want you to know with everything I won't let this go These words are my heart and soul I'll hold on to this moment you know As I bleed my heart out to show and I won't let go
