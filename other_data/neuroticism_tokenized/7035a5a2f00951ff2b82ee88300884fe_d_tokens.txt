Children\ 
with special needs don't have an illness , so they are not contagious . \ 
They want what we all want , which is to be accepted and included . Most \ 
of you probably won't copy and paste this . But will you please do it and\ 
leave it on your status for at least one hour ? It's special education \ 
week and this is in honor of all children . 
Do you want me to tell you HOW I know I love you ??!! I KNOW I love you , because ... when I look at another man ALL I see is you ! 
\I\ 
My mom just found the bathroom cleaner with clorox in it that I had hidden from her . She has gone crazy cleaning and I am getting asphyxiated from the fumes . ohhh noooo ... 
Don't ask if you don't really want to hear the truth . What you don't know won't hurt you . 
Pray for a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot , who calls you back when you < PROPFEMALE > up on him , wait for the boy who kisses your forehead , who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats , who holds your hand tenderly in front of his friends , who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on ... who tells you daily he loves you , lil ' Bride . Let God pick your < PROPMALE > charming out for you ! 
Going to Lowcountry 2010 < PROPMALE > Walk tomorow and Annual Lowcountry Invitational Marching Band Festival today . The weather is perfect ! 
What a wonderful < PROPMALE > Walk ! It is so wonderful to see the community coming together to support understanding , acceptance , and inclusion of people with differing abilities . It makes me hopeful that the entire world will be that way someday ... We just have to tackle it one community at a time ! I love it ! ( < PROPFEMALE > thank for you this post ... I borrowed from you because you said it so perfectly ) . 
A\ 
teacher is somewhere in the world tonight preparing lessons to teach \ 
your children while you are watching TV . In the minute it takes you to \ 
read this , teachers all over the world are not only saving lives , but \ 
they are also sacrificing their own time for your child's literacy , \ 
prosperity ,... and future . Re-post if you are a teacher , love a teacher , \ 
or appreciate our teachers . 
I want to thank each and everyone of you for my happy birthday wishes ! It was a blessed day full of love thanks to my wonderful boyfriend , children and friends - < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , Grace , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > .... and Memaw .

want : to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post \ 
this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It's Special \

way !

It's snowing in Mt Pleasant , SC ! Beautiful ! 
Oh yeah !!! I AM A HANDFUL - unfortunately most women WON'T repost this . I'm strong willed , independent , a bit outspoken , and I tell it like it is . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my .... best . If you are a HANDFUL , repost ! I dare you .... I'll be looking for the ladies who repost !! 
Icy in Mt Pleasant , SC . The state has come to a complete STOP ! Bridges closed ... schools closed ... still in pj's : ) 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Re-post if you agree . 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!!... Re-post if you agree ... 
I recommend watching Madea's Big Happy Family . It has a so many great messages and is funny as all get out too ! Do like I do and just fast forward through all the singing : ) 
TO NON-PET OWNERS who visit our homes . Don't complain about our pets . ( 1 ) They live here , you don't . ( 2 ) If you don't want their hair on your clothes , stay off the furniture . That's why they call it ' Fur'-niture . ( 3 ) Chances are , I love my pets more than I like you . ( 4 ) To you , they are animals ... To me , they are family ... who are hairy , walk on all fours & don't talk back . Re-post if you love your pets ...! 
To all my friends and family out there in Arkansas ...... stay warm , stay safe and enjoy your days off and play in the snow ! 
Tax season is in full swing .... working two jobs .... I have lost my marbles !

Too all my facebook friends who may be receiving an invitation from me for something FREE - DO NOT RESPOND ~ Apparantly it is a scam because I received the same invitation for free Jetblue tickets . Damn spammers ! 
I wish my sweetheart , < PROPMALE > , a very happy birthday today ! You are the kindest , most giving and loving man I have ever known . Thank you for being my best friend and showing me what it is to be truly and unselfishly loved . I love you . 
Took my first day off in 3 months . Cleaned house all day .... and it was peaceful and relaxing . HUH ??!!! You know you have been working way too hard when cleaning the house is peaceful and relaxing . 
My curfew was the street lights , my mom didn't call my cell , she yelled my name , I played outside with friends , not online . If I didn't eat what my mom cooked , then I didn't eat . Sanitizer didn't exist , but you COULD get your mouth washed out with soap . I rode a bike without helmet , getting dirty was OK , and neighbors gave a damn as much as your parents did . Re-post if you drank water from a garden hose . 
It's 5am and we are headed to Columbia for the SC Special Olympics swim meet at Fort < PROPMALE > . Good luck to everyone and especially good luck to my < PROPFIRST > ! 
A 15 year old girl holds her 1 year old son ; people call her a slut . But no one knows she was raped at 13 . People call a girl fat ; no one knows she has a serious disease that causes her to be overweight . People call an old man ugly ; no one knows he had a serious injury to his face while serving our country in Vietnam . RE-Post this if your against Bullying and Stereotyping !!!! Bet none of you will post this . 
Happy Birthday to my beautiful , smart , independent , wonderful < PROPFEMALE > . You have been a joy to me everyday of your life . I received a gift on that faithful day , of which I know I could never repay , Just as God came down to say , he just gave one of his Angels away . I LOVE YOU ! 
Headed off to Atlanta for a 3 day IRS conference . Wish me luck to stay awake in classes . I will miss my sweetheart and thank you < PROPFEMALE > for letting me use your car , Honda Hybrid , to conserve on gas . Yeah ! 
Freakin ' car got a boot on the wheel today because I was 15 minutes late paying the parking lot meter . I had to pay the lot attendant $75 to take the boot off ! RIP OFF ~ ! 
OMG ! I cannot believe she was found \NOT GUILTY\ " ! Those jurors didn't want to be responsible for making her pay for her crime . Rest in peace Caylee < PROPFEMALE >." 
It was so good seeing old work friends from JK < PROPMALE > at the Charleston Riverdogs game last night . 
Just saw Transformers 3 with the boys . It was awesome ! Got out at 10pm and people were dressed up as < PROPMALE > Potter waiting in line for the midnight premier . Really ?

It has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy ... and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post this if you have at least 1 of these friends ; they will know who they are . 
I was RAISED to say please & thank you , to have respect for my elders , lend a helping hand to those in need , hold the door for the person behind me , say excuse me when it's needed , & to love people for who they are , not for what you can get from them ! I was also taught to treat people the way I want to be treated ! If you were raised this way too , re-post this ... sadly , many won't , because they weren't , and it shows . We are becoming a nation of rude people . 
My baby boy just started his first \job\ " tonight at 17 North . Good luck < PROPFIRST > . I am proud of you . "

In remembrance of all the souls who fought through the day of 9/11 . 
That girl you just called fat ? She's overdosing on diet pills . That girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . That man with the ugly scars ? He fought for his country . That guy you just made fun of for crying ? His mother is dying . Put this as you're status if you're against bullying . I bet 95% of you wont re-post , but i'm sure the people with a heart and backbone will ^ .? 
Finished up my 3rd class of bootcamp workout class tonight . I can actually run 1-2 meters without stopping now : )) but I feel my stamina is increasing and the sweat is a pouring . Can't wait to see some results in my body besides soreness . 
Not getting a darn bit of work done today . Too busy reminiscing about the weekend ... downloading , copying , pasting , commenting on all the photos and good times ! 
The most beautiful people we know are those who have known defeat , known suffering , known struggle , known loss , and have found the depths . These persons have an appreciation , a sensitivity , and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion , gentleness , and a deep loving concern . Beautiful people do not just happen . ~ EKR 
Yeah ! Fall has arrived . It's 70 deg outside , windows wide open and a nice breeze . Finally I can save some $ on electric < PROPMALE > : )
