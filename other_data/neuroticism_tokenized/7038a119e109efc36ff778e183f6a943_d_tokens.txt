Just got a new haircut !! It's a new look . Well , more of a tempered look haha :) 
I just read a quote that rings true in my experiences with people . \Conservatives believe what they see while liberals see what they believe . \"" 
I knew that it would tough for the Reds to beat the Phillies , but a No-Hitter against the Reds ?! Damn that sucks !!! Guess they will have to beat them in Game 2 !! 
Tried to find a wine opener for a wine bottle , but didn't find it . Therefore , < PROPMALE > and I decided to drill through the corkscrew as a good substitute !!! We were both wearing safety glasses too ! That's what a UCONN engineering education does for you , \Safety First ! \""

I know there will be lots of people mad at this article , but I believe the substance of the article is true . We are better off now than we were in the 1970s and 1980s . The article doesn't even get into the quality of items now compared to the past . \
