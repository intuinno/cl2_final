I just worked on < PROPFEMALE>'s Farm Town . < PROPFEMALE > lives in Melbourne , Australia , how cool is that !!! 
is loving egg boxes from the grocery store for packing . They are a great size , sturdy and have handles . ( Especially great for books ) 
is excited that she has bought all the land she can in Farm Town . Now I can rearrange my jump field and add some paddocks for my horses :) After that I think I may need a Farm Town intervention . 
has a sick puppy on her lap . I think < PROPFEMALE > has a bug . < PROPMALE > , next door , had a bug a couple of days ago . Hopefully hers will be short-lived too . 
Both dogs are healthy again , it is beautiful outside , I am having breakfast with a friend and then we might do something horsey . Looks like it is going to be a good day :)

is chilling out after a LONG week with very little sleep . Sleeping in is incredible !!! 
came home too late ( 7:00 /dark ) to pass out < PROPFEMALE > . What happened to starting to trick or treat at dark ? or at least dusk ? Everyone here started around 5:30 and they were done by dark . Looks my students will get some extra < PROPFEMALE > :) 
had some staff members over for lunch to see my house . It was fun !!! 
thinks she may have just killed a beautiful pink and yellow orchid that I just bought trying to transplant it . Who knows , maybe not ? 
is happy that my beautiful orchid is still alive ! 
is loving XANGO !!! I was having trouble sleeping because I was coughing like crazy . < PROPFEMALE > brought me a bottle of Xango which I got up and drank , and I actually went to sleep ! Yeah ! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > .

has been < PROPMALE > sick all weekend - round two I guess . This has definitely not been a healthy semester for me . Thankfully I am done painting and could sleep big time ! 
is watching Lie to Me . I love this show and Castle :) 
went to bed at 9:00 last night and slept until 7:00 this morning . I sooo want to be healthy again . Two weeks without kid germs should help ! 
just watched < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . It was good . I wish I could cook like that . I think I may go out and buy the book though :) - Mastering the < PROPMALE > of French Cooking . 
just had a surprise visit from < PROPFEMALE > . I love living close to my friends ! 
rode < PROPMALE > for the first time in months today . Her hind leg seems to have healed well and she was sooo good ! 
rode < PROPMALE > again and she was great ! I love my horse !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!! 
Check out this video . It is really good . I also love the pictures !!! http://www.theinterviewwithgod.com/popup-frame.html 
Happy and Safe New Year to ALL !!! Hope 2010 is a great one ! 
is home from the first day back . My kids were really good !!! 
rode her beautiful girl < PROPMALE > and she was off on her rear hind . I so hope this is not a permanent injury ! 
loves green and pink ! 
worked < PROPMALE > and she seems a little better . Hopefully we will be able to take advantage of Pasha coming out tomorrow ! 
had a great time with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > tonight ! Thanks you two !!! 
is trying to talk herself into going to ride .......... it's COLD ! 
is excited to have a sound horse ! Pasha fixed my < PROPMALE > !!! She was off because she was protecting her right hind . Pasha rode her and made her use that leg . She WAS NOT happy at first , but soon realized it didn't hurt :) I am so incredibly thankful !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > were hanging out at < PROPFEMALE>'s new condo and had a great time ! You have to love when last minute , unplanned things turn out so fun ! 
is thankful for my dad and Uncle < PROPFIRST > . They helped me put a ceiling on my classroom closet , then paint it ! It went from looking old and gross to colorful and nice . 
worked with my dad to paint the door jams around the closet and three other doors for six and a half hours . As we were getting ready to leave I knocked over a gallon of blue paint and it went all over my floor and my purple closet walls . Spilling a gallon of paint is crazy overwhelming , but we did get it cleaned up !!! 
rode < PROPMALE > for less than 20 minutes when she decided she couldn't exist without < PROPFIRST > . It was like a switch went off . She was so pumped I almost couldn't get off her . After free lunging until she was soaked , hand walking to cool her out then blowing her dry , she was still pumped . She continued to be wired until < PROPFIRST > and she were both in for at least 15-20 minutes . She hasn't been like that in a long time . 
< PROPMALE > was somewhat rideable today , but she is soooooo in season and only has eyes for < PROPFIRST > . Wolf was in the arena with us , but that did not seem to do the trick . 
actually came home before 6:00 tonight , though I have to head back out to medicate a bite on < PROPMALE>'s neck . 
is afraid that I forgot to plug in < PROPMALE>'s heated bucket , sooooo it is cold and 11:24 , but I am heading out to check . Ugh ! Thankfully she is close :) 
saw a fox sitting on the side of Waters Road . He was BEAUTIFUL ! He had a dark black nose and a dark black tipped tail . I passed him , slowly backed up , then watched him for at least five minutes . He would twirl in circles , put his nose in the air , then open and shut his mouth . After about five minutes of this , he trotted off down the road then into the woods . 
is struggling with the new facebook layout . First , I couldn't find the logout . Now I really want to know where my lists/groups buttons are for newsfeed . I can't find them . Breaking it into my lists allows me to see a lot of people that don't ususally come up . Uggghh ! 
is watching the Super Bowl and eating nachos with < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . 
enjoyed sleeping in . I just LOVE SNOW DAYS !!! 
had a GREAT birthday ! Thank you so much for all of the birthday wishes . It is absolutely one of my favorite things about facebook ! It makes your birthday feel very special ! Thanks again everybody and Happy Valentines ! 
is wondering if she threw out her back or pulled a back muscle carrying water buckets at the barn . Whoaaa , is this not fun . At first I was going to try to ride anyways . As time passes I am realizing that would not be such a good idea . 
feels bad that I wasn't more empathetic to friends with back issues . 
is soooo thankful for a snow blower . The snow is deep and heavy ! It took me over two hours with a blower . I am definitely thankful that I don't have to shovel . 
was sooo proud of Maddy and < PROPMALE > . Maddy took a lesson from Pasha on < PROPMALE > . They looked great ! Maddy also jumped her . It was pretty awesome !!! 
is thankful Pasha can ride like he does ! I watched him ride and jump < PROPMALE > and the whole time I was watching , all I could think was , \That's my horse ! I can't believe that's my horse !!! \"" 
took apples , carrots , hugs and kisses to < PROPMALE > . Today is her birthday , which is why I named her < PROPMALE > O'<PROPMALE> . What a beautiful day for a birthday . Now I am heading to the barn to put her blanket on for the night . 
trotted and cantered in two-point yesterday , because Pasha wants me to jump Thursday when he comes out . Man it has been awhile . I think waiting a couple more weeks would be a better idea :) 
is loving < PROPFEMALE > on her birthday ! Instead of a bday cake she is getting way too many treats . I have two of the best dogs in the world ! 
fed the horses then shared eggs and toast with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > :) 
has had vertigo since Wednesday - totally not fun ! I am ready to be healthy again . 
is wondering why some of my friends ' birthdays come up on the side of my home < PROPFEMALE > , but not all of them ? 
just watched The Blind Side . What an awesome movie ! There is no way God didn't have his hand in that !!! The key is to be open to following the path he presents and trust your heart . 
bought some White Pine , Serbian Spruce , < PROPMALE > Pear , River Birch , and Sugar < PROPFEMALE > trees . I am soooo excited . I am going from no trees to TREES - though they are baby trees :) 
is thankful for the amazing people in her life ! < PROPFEMALE > Vergon , thank you for giving me trees as a house warming gift . I also want to thank < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > Nowatzke , and mom & dad for helping me to put the trees in the ground . I am sooo happy . They look INCREDIBLE !!! 
just finished and filed my taxes !!! I have never pushed it this close to the 15th :) 
planted 31 trees !!! Help from < PROPMALE > and my dad definitely made planting 31 trees easier . Thank You !!! 
still planting trees . Rain the last two weekends has not helped . Yesterday and today I planted anyways . I was SOAKED :) 
is sooo thankful for sun ! Tired of indoor recess :) 
had unplanned wine & iced tea with close friends . It's wonderful when those last minute things happen to work out . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
is on summer vacation woohoo !!! 
Good friends , wine , and a house of mine to gather . . . . . life is good ! Thanks Rodgers & Sadler gangs for a nice night !!! 
can't sleep :( 
heard from < PROPFEMALE > today and am sooooo excited to see her Thursday :) 
had a WONDERFUL time last night catching up with old roommates and their families !!! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > for coming out and < PROPFEMALE > for helping me to get ready !!! 
went rock hunting with < PROPFEMALE > in their recently plowed field . Lifted a couple of rocks that I probably shouldn't have and gave up on a couple and left them for < PROPMALE > and his tractor . We found some awesome , pretty rocks !!! It was fun ! 
tried to ride < PROPMALE > before I fed . Miss Sassafras let me know she doesn't like riding on an empty stomach . 
is thankful I have Pasha to train < PROPMALE > . No one comes close to riding her like he does . Not only does he make her look gorgeous , with him , she can REALLY jump !!! 
is so happy to have electricity again . One or two days without in the summer is doable , but four is toooo long . I am going to have to save up for a generator !!! 
is wondering if anyone has noticed how the horseflies ( bone pickers ) are out in extreme force this year ? What is up ? I have had to have killed 40+ of them today :( 
met Artemis and < PROPMALE > , Sadler's new barn kitties . They are really cute ! 
is enjoying amazing weather today . With the breeze and in the shade it is almost cool . 
had fun at Red Run Golf Course at a golf outing honoring < PROPMALE > Kramer . I could have listened to < PROPFIRST > Hornung all night . He was hilarious . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > for letting out < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . They were definitely happy I finally came home . 
fed horses , watered flower & trees , and now I am off to go feed horses again :) 
is tired of the humidity ! 
is looking forward to celebrating < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > engagemnt to < PROPFIRST > at the < PROPMALE > Pub Wednesday night at 8 pm . If you want to celebrate with < PROPFEMALE > , stop by and join us :) 
is thankful to have friends like < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > !!! Thoughtful friends definitely help smooth out the rough spots in life ! 
Needs to get back on Facebook . Does it ever stop changing ? 
Cleaning stalls and shoveling paths for my dogs in the deep snow threw my right hip out - three days later . That's a new one and not fun :) Thankfully it is getting better ! 
Thanks so much for all of the birthday wishes ! Birthdays on facebook totally make you feel special ! THANK YOU 
is sooo lucky to have past Abbot kids come over to see me at Eberwhite !!! < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and his mom came to see me today ! What a wonderful surprise !!! It's wild to see your little ones all big and grown . . . . . . not to mention handsome .
