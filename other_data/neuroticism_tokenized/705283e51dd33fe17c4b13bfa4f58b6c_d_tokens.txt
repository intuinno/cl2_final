It'ss amazing 2 focus ur mind on 1 Cgular task of optimizing the body into its original state after a traumatic event . My back injury was a revelation to allow me to realize that human beings are fragile . Failing to make ourselves a priority shortens time . I am glad to revitalize myself and regain years I've lost from only 1 that was taken from me ... -- Only those who dare to fail can achieve greatness .... CM

is bewildered by the fact that I have done so much math in the last three days that I'm starting to find applicable life situtations that accout for implimenting algebraic equations so that I can graph them and get a better insight into their meaning .... 
You know you have done too much math tudoring to your Moth when you are trying to use the substitution method to try and graph the inequality to figure out which school < PROPMALE > to pay more on to try and pay them off faster .... ---- ARGGGGGGG ....... 
It is challenging keeping the only one of your four children who is not sick from catching what the other 3 have .... Ugh ... He's tired of dipping and dodging his brothers ... I don't blame him ... 
Thanks to my kids , I can not get the themes song of Blues Clues out of my head ....

All the boys having lots of gifts this year = Mucho Dinero ... Having them tell us it was the best Christmas ever = Priceless ...

There is nothing that compares the love of a father for his sons . I LOVE YOU GUYS ! ugh ... I don't think I can feel my cheek ... 
If I sent a message to anyone and it made no sense at all . It's because my youngest son , < PROPFIRST > decided to attack the computer when I got up and tried to write his dissertation . 
I love using the line \Not until next year ! \ " with my kids .... Waiting till they get all bummed out .... Then announce to them that next year is less than a week away . * chuckle * It's fun being a parent . "
