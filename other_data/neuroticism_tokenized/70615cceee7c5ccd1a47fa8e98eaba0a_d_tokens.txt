i'm lost like gorilla < PROPFEMALE > , but i know imma find my way ! 

Every ghost has his day 
Thinking ... 
Looking before I Leap ... 
Feelings are like Energy , they cannot be lost nor gained , They simply change form . 
Time , Love , and Money ; At one point in my life I was struggling to understand the concepts of these , now I have so much of them , the struggle is to figure out who to give what to . 
Work like you have never had money , Run like you have never tripped , Love like you have never been hurt , Live life like you will die at midnight . I am tired of postponing things and watching procrastinators , when I wake up tommorrow , I am finally going to do something that I should have done along time ago ... 
They say sleep is the cousin of death , so my eyes are wide open because a dream is kin to my last breath ...
