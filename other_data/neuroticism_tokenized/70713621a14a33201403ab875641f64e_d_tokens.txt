He who walks with the wise grows wise , but a companion of fools suffers harms [ Proverbs 13:20 ] 
Love is always patient and kind ; it is never jealous , love is never boastful or conceited ; it is never rude or selfish ; it does not take offense , and is not resentful . Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in the truth ; it is always ready to excuse , to trust , to hope , and to endure whatever comes . Love does not come to an end .
