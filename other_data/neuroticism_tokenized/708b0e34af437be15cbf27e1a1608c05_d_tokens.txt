My house no longer smells like cigarettes and dog . Hallelujah . 

Wildfires , Blizzards , Thunderstorms , Earthquakes , Daylight , Doomsday . Possibly not in that particular order . 
So bored . Tired of being a useless lump . 
* plays TAPS * 
Somewhere life is good , and things go as they should . It's hard to find , but that's alright . 
In mythology ( any kind ) , a Titan was greater than a God , correct ? ( comments/answers are needed here ) 
Happy Pointless Holiday , everyone . 
Atlanta Falcons , I am disappoint . 
lolGiants 
A special thanks to the Washington Redskins , New York Giants , AND Philadelphia Eagles for all losing today ! Good job ! 
I need < PROPMALE > Plettinck's phone number . Anyone has ? 
African-American weeaboos are creepy as hell . 
< PROPFEMALE > Kristoff Happy birthday , mother . Only 3 more years until the big Six-Oh . 
Tired , depressed , y'know ... the usual ? 
Black Friday's only useful for people who actually HAVE money . 
Can't sleep . Chest pains are pretty bad tonight ; heart's stinging with every beat . 
This whole \waking up at 5 every day\ " thing isn't that fun . " 
Now matter how you play the game , you end up losing . 
I'm sure everyone's read something like this one hundred times by now , but ... WHO DAT !? Screw that overrated Peyton Manning and his retarded Colts . 
ERROR . 
Why do people say \dying alone\ " is some sort of bad thing ? I think it would be nice and relaxing ; wouldn't have to hear anyone crying and whining . " 
Night time always seems strange when you're getting over a sickness . 
Must the mall always be filled with moronic , sniveling girls and retarded hipsters ( crappy band shirts and all) ? 
Ok , I'll revise my statement . Got no job , and only < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Sanchez & < PROPMALE > Larson consider themselves friends . Hopefully I can remedy the first problem quickly , however . 
Got $76.21 from the government . Well , better than paying anything . 
Who remembers Little Guy ? I bet < PROPFIRST > Mihalson does ! 
I only use Facebook for lurking purposes . Much more fun to creep around on other people's walls and such than to post useless status updates . 
A nice evening with < PROPMALE > Larson . I had to leave , as he and his wife had plans to make some bread . I'm sure it tasted great . 
It's kind of funny how some say that certain people are nice to everyone , as the very people they happen to mention aren't nice to me . Go figure . 
I've got more physical problems than a 60-year-old , and I'm only 1/3 the age . What the hell . 
Cthulhu on South Park ? Yes , please . And thank you . 
I\ 
noticed that some people don't seem to want to use contractions when \ 
they type . They feel it's easier to type \you are\ " instead of \ " you're\ " 
People who don't understand the possibility that someone else might have a different outlook on life due to different experiences and different thought processes piss me off so bad . Considering they don't how the other people feel , and yet judge them anyway . 
It pisses me off that a lot of people skim right over Thanksgiving after Halloween is over ( hell , some people even skim over Halloween ) and go straight to their Christmas-athon . Thanksgiving is an important holiday for Americans , but people throw it right out the window . I guess they can't wait three more weeks for their < PROPFEMALE > canes and fat , pedophile men in shopping malls . 
SMASH FACE ON KEYBOARD . POST RESULTS IN THIS STATUS ' COMMENT BOX . 
When I was a kid , I watched Sailor < PROPFEMALE > and Dragon Ball Z . In Sailor < PROPFEMALE > , they taught to stop violence with friendship and love . In Dragon Ball Z , \ 
they taught to stop violence by shoving your foot so far up the \ 
trouble-making cocksucker's ass that they could taste the dog shit on \ 
the bottom of your shoe . 
Happy Thanksgiving . But , remember that there are some people that don't have any friends of family to share this wonderful holiday with . So , keep these people in your thoughts as you spend good times with your loved ones today , as some others must spend Thanksgiving alone . 
I'm thinking that all I really need is a good , swift kick to the back of the head . It would probably help a surprisingly positive amount , especially if it kills me . 
Kind of funny that I always manage to screw up when I finally have something even semi-good going for me . Then again , I am quite skilled at self-sabotage .... not intentionally , of course , but still . >> b 
Absolute Zero this Thursday ! See you there , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ! Oh , wait . 
Well , never mind all that . Sure , I may have overreacted just a little , but it made me feel better , even though I'm too angry to sleep now . 
Since everyone else is doing some sort of number game , here's some < PROPFIRST > for you : 2012 did 9-11 . Prove me wrong . 
Had absolutely no one to talk to today . Wonderful . 
* BLAM* ! 
You know , Jesus ' life is honestly a pretty good story if you only look at it for what it is , and don't actually believe that it ever really happened . 
I love how all my friends have grown and prospered in their educational and employment endeavors over the past couple years , and here I am , still in the exact same rut . Hooray for failure . Well , bed time . 
So , how's everyone doing ? I don't think I've asked that simple question in a long time . 
LOL @ New Years parties . 
Hopefully going to watch The Dark Knight tonight to try and wash the memories of Batman & < PROPFIRST > out of my skull . I suggest < PROPMALE > Larson does the same , ASAP . 
Unattractive people are still people . Just saying . 
2.5 hours of < PROPFIRST > Tosh tonight ? Sounds good to me . 
Seems that < PROPMALE > Mckellen has agreed to once again play Gandalf in the new Hobbit movie(s ) . A weight feels lifted . 
Atlanta got quite the mud-hole stomped into their asses tonight . Only people left in the stands right now are Green Bay fans and a bunch of empty seats . 
Going to be one of those nights , I can see . 
Nothing quite like teasing desperate 13-year-old boys with my pair of virtual , fleshy wrecking balls . 
PSO2 is confirmed to not be taking place in Gurhal or on Ragol . A weight feels lifted . Though , brace for fanboy rage . Lulz will be had . 
Damn < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and his status derailing . 
How come so many people feel that it's taboo to be attracted to a cartoon/anime/fictional member of the opposite sex ? Our brains are designed to simply recognize a man/woman , whether or not they're real or make-believe , and judge physical attraction solely based upon that . People that say \You think that cartoon girl is pretty ? You got problems ! \ " need to get kicked in the teeth . " 
So , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are pretty much the coolest gals I know . Sorry , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . 
Hell yes . Send those Shittsburgh dickheads back where they came from . Good job to the Green Bay Packers for using our beautiful stadium to crush the Steelers ' hopes and dreams . Nothing better . Well-deserved win to Rodgers and the rest of The Pack ! 
Leave it to Steelers fans to complain that the last play of the game should have been a pass interference penalty . Show some class and take your loss like sportsmen , you dimwits . Stop grasping a straws and playing \coulda-shoulda-woulda \"." 
So , < PROPFIRST > Beck said that the NFL players at the Super Bowl weren't patriotic because they didn't have their hands over their hearts during the national anthem . Not patriotic , huh ? That's why some of the players ( on both teams ) were shown with tears in their eyes during the song , right ? Eat shit , Beck . 
A woman is Wisconsin repainted her famous < PROPFIRST > Favre tribute on the side of her barn , and renamed it \ Mr. < PROPMALE>'s Neighborhood\ " . Good stuff . " 
I hate my paranoia . I wish there was a way to reprogram my subconscious so that it wouldn't think that my friends secretly hate me , because I know it's not true ( I think ) ... v_v 
According to Google , \thou mad\ " is more popular search term than \ " thou shall not kill/steal\ " . Another victory for the interwebz . " 
My muffin's hard . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 
Lesson of the day : If you think someone is hiding their true feelings from you , just remember , anger is better than alcohol when it comes to spilling secrets . Piss someone off enough , and they'll tell you what they really think about you . The truth flows from their mouth like fine wine . 
I'm pretty sure < PROPFEMALE > Wars stopped being cool about 10 years ago . Can it please go away now ? 
The translated lyrics from the Skyrim \theme song\ " :\ 
\Common sense\ " is the biggest paradoxical statement on the face of the Earth . " 
Just downloaded the full version of \Ignite Infinity\ " . OM NOM NOM . " 
I'm so used to frowning all the time , that it makes smiling feel weird . It even makes my cheeks cramp a little . 
Obvious April Fools jokes are scathingly obvious . People need to try harder .
