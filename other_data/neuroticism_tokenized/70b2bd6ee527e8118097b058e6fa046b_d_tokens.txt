Happy New Year to all my friends and family ! 

Is back from taking the dog to the dog park and is frozen to the bone ... 
Of to the Animal Shelter to volunteer 
Losing your Best Friend is never easy ... but in the end , I shall be in peace . RIP Bougart . You will sorely and truly be missed ... 6/20/2009 
Is going to see fireworks tonight ... if we don't get rained on XD 
First < PROPMALE > McMahon , then < PROPFEMALE > Fawcett , THEN < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and NOW < PROPFIRST > Mays ... who's next in line ? ( Let's just hope it's not < PROPMALE > Hanks ... ) 
Is out helping in the yard clearing brush and such ... * fun * .... 
Is probably not going to the animal shelter today ... bummer = C 
my mom made me update this ...... 
Is helping babysit today ... Looks like nothing more is going to be done in my room today . 
Woot ! We're going to get another dog ! <3 
Well , if < PROPFIRST > is getting old , Then I'm getting OLDER ! ( by four months ) 
Ranger's Home ! ( Our new dog ) Will have pictures up soon ... 
Schoolbag in hand She leaves home in the early morning Waving goodbye With an absent-minded smile I watch her go With a surge of that well-known sadness And I have to sit down for a while The feeling that I'm loosing her forever And without really entering her world I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter That funny little girl - slipping Through My Fingers ( Mamma Mia ) 
Is out watching the meteor shower going on right now ... so far I've see a couple bright , and beautiful , ones 
I swear I'm never going to truly to get my own bed back till I move out ... =( 
To Jilly : Haha ! I'm actually TALKING with < PROPFIRST > on the phone right now ... and you missed out . We tried calling your cell and you didn't answer ... so .... HAHA !

The story of my day ... first I got knocked off my feet at the dog park and now both me and Ranger were stung by a swarm of bees . 
Is off to eat dinner ... though I'm honestly not really hungry =S 
Is back from Popcorn Festival in Beavercreek . Awesome time ! 
Today , I was at the doctor's office . Because I'm a teenager , I was required to take a survey about drugs , alcohol , and sex . It asked if I was in a gang . I wrote ' marching band ' . MLIA -- Haha , this is for all those out there that are in Marching Band ! 
(^^^) ... I am a shark ... 
Today , I saw a member of the marching band beat up a guy on the football team . I've never been more proud to be a member of the marching band . MLIA 
It's nearly 2 in the morning ... and I can't sleep . 
Is busy baby sitting the neighbor girl ... might not be on much till later in the evening .... 
Ice cubes . Lovely frozen ice water to suck on ... 
Today was my schools homecoming pep rally . At the end , the Marching Band and the football team went against each other in tug-of-war . The Marching Band won . MLIA 
If you dont like the new FB here is how you can change it back to the old . Look to the top left menu and click on MORE . Then drag STATUS UPDATES to the top . After dragging to top , ... click on it . That becomes your default and it is like before . Pass it ... on ! 
Won't be home most of the day . Going to Cincinnati for school stuff ... 
Finally back home ... one step closer to getting into school ! <3 
Happy Halloween to everyone ! .... now to get a nap in before I go out with the neighbor kids 
Today I realized the reason our school doesn't let us use plastic knives for lunch is because we could use them as weapons . We are however allowed to use scissors , X-Acto knives , bandsaws , nail guns , acids , archery arrows , stapple guns , and cookery knifes . I just feel safe knowing I won't be threatened with a plastic eating utensil . MLIA 
Homemade chocolate chip cookies and Arizona Raspberry ice tea in a shot glass = Epic Win ! 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone ! <3 
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ! ... Even though the sound of it Is something quite atrociousI . f you say it loud enough , you'll always sound precocious ... Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ! 
Ugh ... why is it I get sick when I don't need to/ want to ... 
Well , woke up this morning feeling better ... must have been a fluke bug I had . 
Just when I think things are getting better , it comes back around and makes me feel worse . 
The count down begins ... time to finish packing for tomorrows trip <3 
Off to bed now ! Going to be up bright and early at 4 am and then in the car for another 11 hours . Ah , gotta love long road trips 
Here soon it's going to be bye bye Ohio and hello Nebraska !

My wish for 2010 is that people will understand , that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... They have been eaten by dragons . ;)

Farmville Friends , Please stop joining groups , they do nothing but let hackers in and cause problems with facebook , you will not get anything free . Please copy and repost so maybe we can stop it . Farmville has already advised that they are not the originators of these scams . If you do still join them DO NOT INVITE ME < PLEASE !!!!! 
Time to get off and bake some late night cookies , now the question is : Sugar or Chocolate Chip ? 
Wow , South < PROPFEMALE > is so pretty ... the sun is shining and it's so warm here . I got to visit Hunting Island yesterday with my dad and saw the ocean for the first time . Well , back to school work for the moment and maybe head to the pool in a few for P.E.

I choose to live this life of solitude not because I hate you . No , I choose this life because I love you too much and never want to hurt you again ... 
I'm hungry ... guess that means it's time to get off and head back to the rental house from the coffehouse . 
Ugh ... this is not how I wanted my day to start ... 
I should be in bed right now ... but the internet is so enticing ... 
I'm up .... I'm moving .... and I'm on my way back home to Ohio . Gotta catch my flight home here in just a few . 
I'm home here in Ohio ... and now I'm ready to go back to South < PROPFEMALE > ...

Okay , it's offical , I am difficult to shop for when it comes to prom or anything clothing in general ... especially shoes ... I must not be a normal girl ... 
Back from the Petland Boycott ... home for the moment , then back out the door to the dog park .... 
The search is over ! A dress has been found ! =3 
Even with gray , gloomy on and off rain , my day has been nothing but sun shine after seeing < PROPFEMALE > ... <3

It's hot hot hot ... anyone have some ice cream that I can have ? lol 
Nothing like being hungry and there's nothing in the house ...

I got my sweet tea , got my pop tarts , got my puppy ... life is good =) 
Up doing some late night school work that needs to get done , not fun ... looking on the brighter side of things , the sooner I get it done the better as next week is the last week of school . 
It's oh so quiet ... 
Some times a dream is all it takes to make you wake up in reality ... 
Well , it's offical . I am now here in SC for good ! 
The Mad Hatter :\ 
Have I gone mad ? \ 
\ 
[ < PROPFEMALE > checks Hatter's temperature ] \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Kingsley :\ 
I'm afraid so . You're entirely bonkers . But I'll tell you a secret . All \ 
the best people are . 
When that day comes I shall futterwacken ... vigorously 
... I think it's time to head to bed now ... feeling sick looking at the bright computer screen . 
I think I'm coming down with somethng ... I seem fine up until I start to clean and then I feel nauseous , even from our oderless ant killer ... DX 
My puppy is growing up so fast ! Only ten weeks , eleven in a couple days and she already knows : Sit , down , to go to the back door if she needs to go out , how to walk somewhat on a leash , and now Paw ( Shake) ! There are still areas in the work in progress stage though . To think by the time Petsmart comes around , she'll jump right into more advanced classes before ever touching a single puppy class . <3 
I FINALLY WON THE GAME ... aaand now I just lost it ... crap ... 
Wishes so dearly that her puppy would quit trying to eat her puzzle ... > < 
Is starting to get annoyed with the constant diconections with Frontierville ... 
I guess I should get off here and go to bed as I do have plans for tomorrow ... Night night Facebook ! 
Is eating Cold Stone Creamery Ice Cream Parlor flovered jelly beans by Jelly Belly . So good ! <3 
So board ... wish the library was close enough here that I could walk to it ... 
Palmetto Bug , Palmetto Bug , Where for are thou oh Palmetto Bug ... UNDER MY SHOE AND IN THE TRASH SUCKER !!! 
I'm up for a little longer ... maybe an hour at most before I try to get some sleep . It's funny how being here has changed my way of sleeping . 
If I had just one tear Running down your cheek Maybe I could cope Maybe I'd get some sleep If I had just one moment at your exspense Maybe all my misery Would be well spent ... 
So , what's everyone doing for their Dads for Fathers Day ? 
WHERE ARE ALL THESE DANG PALMETTO BUGS COMING FROM !?!?! 
Shooting at the walls of heartache Bang , bang ! I am the warrior . Well I am the warrior . And heart to heart you'll win . If you survive the warrior , the warrior 
Is really , really board ... can't ask anyone to do anything as I really don't know anyone down here yet and no bike to get around with , so I'm stuck here in the house . 
Is hot , tired , and strangely satisfied that she did yard work in 92 ( Feeling like 102 according to Weather.com ) weather . Now to get some ice cream and cool off . 
The didn't like me ! They NEVER liked me ! 
It's seven in the morning and my puppy has the zoomies ... Where in the world did she get all this energy from ? Me , I'm not quite sure , but all I know is I want some of it ... 
Is unhappy with Farmville . Not to sound like a whiny bitch , but why it the world would you do that ? Get my hopes up that I could build a Japanese barn to go with my others only to find out to get the frame you need to have 50 FV CASH which I do not have nor can I get . I'm loosing hope with this game ... 
It's storming here and my hair smells like Bananas ! =D 
Ho hum ... time to go clean the carpets ( my first time ever ) and then scoot on out of the house for a little while while the carpet dries ... all sounds fun no ? 
You know , it's funny how undereducated most people seem be about a head halter on a dog . Yes , I am not surprised that people just to to conclusion that my dog may bite . But at the same time it bothers me when I see the look on their faces . 
So board ... wish I had someone to < PROPFEMALE > with , even if it means just sitting around watching movies . 
It's raining here ... and I'm board . 
I'm craving more hot fries now ... DX 
mma be up in the club doin ' whatever I like Imma be poppin ' that bubbly , coolin ' and livin ' that good life Oh , let's make this last forever , partyin ' with you together On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and 
I really want to color something now ... anyone have a coloring book ? 
Time to get some food ... <3 
My puppy is scared of loud noises and things coming at her and I don't know how to deal with it ... I feel so defeated already 
I feel like dancing\ 
To this fast and crazy beat . \ 
Feeling this itch , this ache , from my head to my feet . \ 
I rock it all out , \ 
Dancing and singing out loud . \ 
At the top of my voice , \ 
Not once caring if I have a crowd . 
Two weeks and counting down ... not 100% looking forward to it all . 
Oh my , seems I'm slacking in the picture department again . Will update them later tonight if I can , tomorrow at the latest . In other news - I got my Professional Prom Pictures now and will also be scanning them in/ uploading them tonight/tomorrow as well for everyone to see . <3 
Did anyone else for the longest time today NOT be allowed to log in here on FB ? =/ 
TO ALL MY GAME FRIENDS : My key games I play are - Pet Society , Family Feud , and Farmville . I no longer play many of the games I use to , but I will continue being neighbors in all games needed . All I ask is PLEASE don't send me gifts to any other games but the ones listed above [ Pet Society , Family Feud , and Farmville ] . Thank you . 
It's 3:18 in the morning ... and I can't sleep . 
Oh the funny things our pets can do ... 
It's official , the carpet cleaner has become my new best friend ... 
So ... much .... running ... I hate back to school shopping .... 
Off to the first day of school ... lucky me =) 
I'm home and happy . Today was interesting to say the least ... might put my schedule up later if anyone else wants to see it ... 
Well ... todays school day was pretty much a bust ... should have opted to stay home ... 
My Schedule is up if anyone wants to see it . Look under my notes to find it ... 
ARGH !!! With in a week and a half I have had two schedule changes ... and once my transcripts finally come in , I'm going to have another one ! .... I need a hug ... 
Well , it's official . I'm back in the band ! Oh dear flute how I missed you so ... 
Finished with my Math Homework finally ... ugh , I'm so going to hate spending 90 minutes with Mr. Fillmore tomorrow ... but on the plus side , at the end of the day I'll be in band with my flute . Now , off to finish getting things together for tomorrow and getting to bed . Night everyone ! 
Grrr ... home not feeling good ... so much for shooting to have no sick days ... 
Off to school ... OOH-rah ! 
Just survive tomorrow and I'll have a three day weekend ! I'll try to get some pics of me in my school \uniform\ " and my JROTC Camis this weekend . " 
I think I'm going through a personality change to the point of where it's scaring everyone . Wanting to wear make up , mini skirts [ respectable , nothing slutty or that sort ] .... just starting to be a little more girly than normal . I'm just tried of being a \plain jane\ " and getting looked over all the time for my looks . " 
' s going to go dress up as the grim reaper , and run around in the Nursing home and say , \See you soon !. \"" 
I am home ! =D Standing four hours holding a sign and switching to drying , the band car was successful ! 
I'm thinking it's time to hit the hay ... been such a long day ... 
is watching Tourettes Uncovered on discovery channel . It's amazes and saddens me what these kids have to live with every single day of their lives ... 
Just got a lesson in how to use an iron ... =) 
My schedule : Got up at 6 this morning , had some McDonald's , and by 0800 I was out at the JROTC's Adopt a Highway picking up trash . Productive morning so far =) 
Caution : May show signs of irritable , bitchy-ness and sudenly lash out ... you've been warned ... 
Is thinking about getting a hair cut ... or at least a trim with some bangs ... 
Come here little kiddy and let me offer you some < PROPFEMALE > ... 
: I AM WHAT I AM ... your approval isn't needed and it wasn't never asked ! Sorry 
amazing how your whole day is going great until one event ruins it all . 
you never know what you'll miss till its gone , when I'm gone please don't even say you miss me . I'm done with that lie .. 
Why did I fall for it ? ... I had all the freaking warning signs and still chose to go for it and now I am suffering for it . Dumb jerk couldn't even tell it to my face that he truly didn't want to go out with me , but instead just use me .. 
Tell me this .... why is it the moment I look forward to something that I really want to do , something , even if it's just a little thing , has to fuck everything I look forward to up ? </3 
Going to lie down for a short nap , then get ready to go and celebrate with Talyor 
Grr ... these random mood swings are getting annoying ... it's like I have an on/off switch and I can't find it 
Well , off to bed . < PROPMALE > day is not a holiday we get off here in SC for the schools , I must get some sleep and be ready for that time/graded mile long rotc run tomorrow ... hope Gunny < PROPFIRST > has coffee ready for me in the morning ... 
My one mile run time - 9:44 ... I think I can do better next quarter . Let's try making it somewhere between 9:10 and 9:20 next time ... 
So confused , angry ... and no one else to blame but myself for the most part . 
Hanging out with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Jordy ... going to watch movies at < PROPMALE>'s later =) It feels good and weird not having school today . 
Well , good bye 3 day vacation , hello school day ... just gotta remind myself to get through this week and then BOOM ! Off all week next week =D ... In other news : I'm in the Drama Club ! 
I underestimated how much I would miss you till now ... 
Had a great night ! Thanks again < PROPFEMALE > for letting me go out with you guys =) Now to get off here and get ready for bed ... Even though I'm the only one out of the three HSers , I have to go to school tomorrow . ICK ! XP 
So , extended learning wasn't so bad ... rather of stayed home than gone though = S 
Yippie ! I now have my beginners permit ! <3 Now only 180 more days [ and counting down ] until I can take the drivers test and get my license ... 
So , I drove on the road for the first time this evening . Little nerve wrecking , but fun ... 
A little turkey , a little stuffing , and a good time for all ... Happy Thanksgiving to all ! =) 
-sigh- So , here ends the five day weekend and the whole back to school normalcy ... Three weeks and counting down till next break and Christmas ! <3 
You know , it's bad when the police AND the principle have to be called over stupid shit that could have been avoided ... I swear a good amount of HS kids now a days have no common sense anymore ... 
... We're so special , when you look in the dictionary under \short bus\ " 
One of these days I WILL get through all the requests I have neglected for so long ... @.@ 
You know , when people say that children bring some much joy and laughter , take their word for it because it is so true . Even though I only spent two and a half hours with the kindergarteners , I felt something magical with all of them that makes me want to go back and work with all of them again ... 
Cookies are an epic fail ... must abort the mission and go to bed soon ... 
Bleh ... home sick today with a fever ... 
It's funny that you don't notice how much you miss someone so much until you start talking with them again ... 
Well , time to wrap it up and start cleaning my room soon ... 
Wanting to wish all my family and friends a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and a happy start to your new year =) 
Managed to get No Reservations tonight while at the store ... one down , so many more movies to go to add to my collection ! 
... just had the realization that I need to go out and get post cards and that I can't get any here on < PROPFEMALE > Bay ... 
The more I deal with this teacher ... the more and more I get pissed being around him ... 
Off to bed ... maybe tomorrow will be a good day ... 
Well ... I guess it's time to get off and go to bed so I can go to this place called \school\ " in the morning ... ugh ... " 
Plans for this weekend : Sleep , clean out and update the MP3 player , and < PROPFEMALE > with friends ... probability of any of this happening ? Slim to none ... 
Zodiac signs have been changed ... interesting ... at least I'm still a Pisces . 
So tired ... Hope I'm not this tired when I march with the band in the parade tomorrow ... 
You think a little rain is going to ruin my parade ? I don't think so ! 
Ugh , don't you hate it when you're having such a good day and then the weather just makes you feel awful ? 
Wow , it's sunday and we all know what that means ... Why does tomorrow have to start on a sucky day for school ? Maybe it's just me , just I HATE my A days ... 
Anyone know < PROPFEMALE > Watson's number I can get a hold of ? She's not here yet and I'm planning on getting out the door soon ... 
Well , I guess it's time for me to finish up the laundry and go to bed . All I have to say is , TGIFT ( Thank God It's Friday Tomorrow ) 
Life Explained : On the first day , God created the dog and said :\ 
' Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past . For this , I will give you a life span of twenty years . ' \ 
The dog said : ' That's a long time to be barking . How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten ? ' \ 
So God agreed . \ 
On the second day , God created the monkey and said : 
Well , I'm an \auntie\ " for the weekend ! < PROPMALE > got his \ " baby\ " for the weekend and I get to help =D " 
Enjoying my evening clearing out 5000+ neglected emails ... not ... 
So , the music sucked , I embarrassed myself over a simple miscommunication , and I seem somehow to be the only one dancing by myself which isn't any fun ... over all point : the dance I went to tonight sucked ... fml 
Okay , say a little prayer for me as so I don't wreak dads car and kill anyone out on the main road here in a few ... in other news : I'm hungry 
Do I have to go to school tomorrow ? 
You smile I smile you cry I cry You laugh I laugh You trip I laugh harder cause I'm the one who tripped you 
Well , time to scamper off to shower and bed . Maybe I can sleep tonight and feel rested tomorrow ... 
Well folks , it's been evening at band camp , but I managed to somehow survive it . Now time to get some shut eye before getting up early tomorrow for ROTC stuffs . Night ! 
Reminder : All ROTC friends , don't forget to wear < PROPFEMALE>'s tomorrow ! \ 
In other news : I got to play with a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope third period today ! <3 
if you saw me in a police car , honestly what would you think i got arrested for .!? Post this as your status & see wat crime you get accused of 
Rehearsing lines for Drama club , practicing for our band competition in Charleston next week , coming up with craft ideas for Early Childhood AND trying to get things together for my party ! I'm in for many busy weeks coming up ... someone remind me how I got myself into some of this mess ? XD Night everyone 
Thank you to all my friends and family for the wonderful Birthday wishes . I had an interesting and wonderful day . Love , hugs , and kisses to all <3 =) 
Applying for jobs online ... fun .... 
You have to stop and wonder some days that when everything is going right , what is that one little thing that can make everything go wrong ... 
Well , as soon as I finish my cough medicine and fold the laundry , I'll be off to bed . Cross your fingers everyone and hope the band doesn't suck too much at Charleston tomorrow ... 
Ugh ... being up early on what's suppose to be my spring break and not having coffee is not what I would call a good morning ... well , time to school to the bus . Hope everyone who isn't in ELT is enjoying their time off . 
ugh feel like crap ... what ever is going through my system I wish would hurry up and get out ... 
ugh ... nothing screams \great day\ " like locking yourself out of your own Ipod ... " 
Alrighty FB , time to get off here and get things ready for school tomorrow ( ew ) night ~
