Bummed the boys are gone again ... and THIS time I'm not getting any happy surprise visits until fall break :( :( :( But it was a lovely weekend , and I thank you all for it :) 

It's a good day , found < PROPFIRST>'s Gideon Juras :) :) :) 
Slightly bruised and battered , but fine ... since I was driving an SUV and the slightly drunken man was driving a car , I win ! 
No longer bruised and battered , but mighty tired :) 
Thank you < PROPMALE > , for reminding me I need to get on here once in a while :) 
What a lovely weekend ... my kids are happy , my hubby is happy , and all is right with the world . 
Oh , yeah , GREAT ride tonight , and much fun with my BFF ! I love my pony :)
