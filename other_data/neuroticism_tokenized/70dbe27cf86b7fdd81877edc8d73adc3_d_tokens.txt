Carpet is Shampoo'd . Looks like a whole new house . I need to invite people over before I make it a mess again . 

Parents out of SLO . Time to work on researching intelligent tutoring systems for my thesis ( Which I promised myself I'd make progress on before the quarter starts . Looks like a day of reading papers at the library/csl tomorrow . Fun quarter start . 
I miss reading ... I remember sitting in high school reading science fiction under the desk during math class ... what happened to all the free time in the world :( . 
Who's idea was it to make my graphics multi-threaded ? I mean I totally needed all these concurrency bugs ... Oh right , mine >.> . \ 
* hits run * Draw SOMETHING damn you ... ( anything ? please ? ) 
The wind today is so glorious . I blaim my lack of productivity yesterday with having to take a cold shower every two hours to stay sane . \ 
\ 
On a side note : I miss the days we could go in the front yard with a few plastic buckets , a long piece of plastic , and a hose and pretend we had our very own private water park . 
is trying to decide whether to take fencing or gymnastics class this summer . \ 
If I don't take a class , I totally won't exercise enough >.> 
gave blood today . 
is playing on OnLive . \ 
The service works and rocks . 6$ to buy a game for a week is reasonable , better than Blockbuster would give you . Some of the features ( like Arena ) really rock . \ 
Now they just need more games .... 
wants to know how much Next To Normal tour tickets are going to cost in LA . \ 
Envy @ less than 40$ tickets that certain people in NYC got >:( 
just heard an ad on pandora for SF Symphony . Advertising music from Final Fantasy . \ 
Life just rocks . 
is off to ' New Employee Orientation ' . As far as I can tell it means filling out paperwork ... yay ? 
envies certain people seeing Next to Normal tonight . \ 
Have fun ! 
likes being a saleried employee . Can take lunch whenever he wants , for as long as he wants , not exactly 30 minutes between the 4th and 6th hour worked .

thinks it would be fun to hold a ge t-t ogether . You know , Chips and Dip + Apples to Apples , Werewolves/Mafia , Cranium , Charades . Fun little 2 hour evening thing to cool off after work ... Any intrest ? 
Siblings say the darnest things . Canned celery , what a novel idea . 
Anyone currently in the south bay interested in going to see Despicable Me ? 
I'm not afraid of anything ... Be it mountains , water , dragons , dark or sky ! 
4 Dollar Surcharge for 3D ? I mean it looks good , but thats a little much . \ 
Despicable Me was ok . Not really worth seeing a second time . Only Megamind and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are maybe's ... 
Apparently my Amazon shipment is out for delivery in Texas ... wtf ? \ 
\Destination : \ 
Why am I still at work ? I really don't know :( \ 
Really , these build/deploy times are getting ridiculous . 
was utterly lazy today ... Which is ok , but I wish I had something interesting to do tomorrow :( 
Ahh , the joys of being at work on a Sunday evening 
Apparently there is a pickup soccer match during lunch at the park down the block from work twice a week . Might be fun .... 
Resolution : No more eating free work food . \ 
Free Pizza Wednesday and Thursday , and chips and salsa today ? Totally took in too many calories . Canned soup for lunch from now on . 
\You've reached your monthly free limit\ " .. Really ? Already ? " 
Build damn you build . \ 
Boo @ not being able to build from home . I don't wanna be at work right now :( . \ 
The deploy time sucks too >.< 
The bag of crap from woot.com was full of ... well ... crap ... \

It'll be in South Bay or East Bay , Probably Friday after work . 
OMG @ San < PROPMALE > Fire ... 
Yay @ Out of gas ( Firefly Episode ) being back on Hulu . Its one of the best in the series . 
Karaoke , 6pm-9pm on Thursday in Cupertino . Currently have about five people , but the more the merrier ! 
Presentation Time ... I got a demo that doesn't crash ! ( I hope ) 
You know how sometimes you feel like you can stick your forehead in a bucket of water and it would all boil away ? 
BOO ! Next To Normal starts in LA one week after the ACM Programming Contest . I was hoping to consolidate trips to LA :( . 
has free time again . Holy **** . \ 
This low class load + no work thing is wierd . If it keeps up , I might actually have to be social . 
I need my razor I left in the bay area ... :( 
Beleive it or not , I'm cold . \ 
Been in the CSL way to long . 
First they pass the horribly flawed DMCA , then they complain that it doesn't work , now they want to pass an internet blacklist . \ 
I'd like to say this has no way of passing , but that gives congress too much credit . I mean really , a blacklist ? 
A cat came to my door . I opened it to pet it , and it let itself in ... And had a massively bloody neck . like a collar . Maybe a fight ? I turned to my computer to look up animal control and it let itself out . I should of closed the door before looking for the animal control number . Poor thing . I hope it's ok ... 
What is it about Eletric Gutairs and Violins that make them go so well together ? 
I know authors like to cite themselves , but I think the paper I am reading just citied itself . Not a previous work by the same author , but the same exact paper . \ 
... 
Just had a Salame , Provolone , and Penut Butter Sandwitch . o.o 
I am not buying CIV V . I am not buying CIV V . I am not buying CIV V ... \ 
Its so easy now with steam >.> \ 
Damn you Slade Villena for your constant CIV updates . \ 
I will not buy CIV V . I will not buy CIV V ...... 
is seriously considering not having internet at home . 
Eeeek ! I'm in the math building . Math cooties ! 
You know how you see an add and do a double-take ? \ 
There is a billboard in SLO that says \Your relationship may not last 
neat @ having live band in front of the university union . They are just missing an audience . \ 
Pretty good though . 
Ugh . Voting is so much work . Have to research everything . 
Whew @ 3.5 hours of issue research for my ballot . \ 
I started out thinking I was going to be mostly blue , but it turned out more red than blue . \ 
Yes on 21/22 , no on the rest . \ 
State Exec : 2 Dem , 4 Repub , 2 Lib\ 
Fed : 2 Repub\ 
Given the dems are rather high up on the ticket , but still , redder than I expected before sitting down to vote . 
is super-jazzed by his job offer . Was not expecting the < PROPFIRST > he saw on it . \ 
Just wow ... 
Stuck in the CSL until the rain stops . Boy its downpouring . 
wants a couch to curl up on ... 
Really amazon , 4$ to rent a movie for 24 hours ? I can get them at redbox for 1$ 
Riverside here we come ! Cal Poly is gonna win this year ! 
There is a ( student ? ) preacher out on < PROPMALE > Lawn waving a bible over his head and ranting . \ 
Unexpected ... 
Victory ! \ 
Front Row , Center tickets to Spring Awakening .

On the other hand , thats 6$/month for unlimited web = Win 
The CSL is under attack by dresses ! 
Going to go play board games at game theory for two hours and then go listen to how to survive the zombie apocalypse . Today is a good day . 
is back in SLO ( from the mystical land of no-internet ) . Now to the CSL to work on distributed ! 
Why arn't there radio stations that play music from muscials ? It would be so awesome ! 
Spring Awakening is the same weekend as the Global Game Jam . Its technically afterwords ( GGJ ends like at 5 ) , but I don't know if I want to have such little sleep when going to such an awesome show . 
needs another neat class for next quarter , Ballroom Dancing is full . 
Anyone know if a grocery store in SLO has fresh Okra ? Scolari's doesn't have it :( 
could not find fresh Okra . Apparently it is out of season . Isnt that what greenhouses are for :( . Frozen it is . 
31 dollars in ingrediants and a clean kitchen . Life is good . 
is still not enrolled for next quarter . Meep ! 
My presentation in 590 is Friday , not tomorrow . Whew , I was preparing like it was tomorrow . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > , you saved me from an unneeded alnighter :) . 
Federal Judge shoots down BAMN and upholds prop 209 . Wow , took them long enough ? That passed what , 1996 ? Does this mean prop 8 will still be in litigation in 2022 ? 
Finished Distributed Paper Part . Working on 590 . Almost done for the quarter ! 
Its kinda sad that there are at least 8 people in the CSL right now who have been here since before they shut the doors for the night . \ 
Yay last minute all-nighter ? 
Warning ! Warning ! Onion mist level reaching toxic level . Ventilation fan at critical . All hands , evacuate kitchen immediately ... Warning ! Warning ! \ 
Ow , my eyes >.> 
Placed an order on amazon and immediately realized I gave the SLO shipping addt instead of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . But can I change it ? Noooo , my order is being prepared for shipment ... They got an email , if they cant fix it , I order again and then return the one that went to SLO . Yuck . Expensive for amazon who paid free shipping on the item . 
I think its BS that Transunion and Equifax charge to thaw your credit . They get money every time someone does a credit search , they should be bending over backwords to have me use credit , instead of making me pay an additional 20$ to unfreeze it . \ 
Its BS . \ 
Its also BS that everyone wants to check all three credit reports . Check only one . Then I could reward Experian for having friendly policies . 
Dial-up internet only ... what do to . \ 
Connected my desktop and laptop on a local network , have my laptop on an ad-hoc wireless network with my dad's laptop in the other room , which is connected via dial-up internet . On my desktop looking at Facebook . Weeee ... \ 
On the plus side , you get to play a lot of board games with family when there is no TV or useful internet ^^ . 
Back in SLO . Yay\ 
In the CSL . * rolls eyes * 
I just want to say how cool it is that we get keycard access to multiple buildings on campus . How did people get work done before they put those in ? 
I can't wait for Spring Awakening ! Only 3 more weeks ! 
American Express denied me for a credit card , but Visa was ok with it ... 
CSL is full to the brim , people sitting on the floor . So I went to the library , First and Second floor noisy and packed , third floor quiet , but every seat next to a outlet was used >.> . Finally found a spot on the forth floor . \ 
Come on people , who can study without power ? 
is wearing 5 layers o.o 
SLO Library System for a book : 1 Paperback , 2 Cassettes , or 27 CD's . \ 
What the .... \ 
HOW does it take 27 CD's to fit the content of 2 Cassettes ? Or rather , how do you fit 34 Hours of reading into two Cassettes ? I don't care if it is abridged , that is a whole ton of cutting . 
Finally got over my writers block . Now time to sleep . 
I will once again state how fun it is to watch old animated songs ( Disney , ect ) in other languages on Youtube . If you can't understand it , you can just sit and listen to how the voice interacts with the music . \ 
Then you read the subs . It is kinda weird when what would of been three lines in English becomes one in Russian . And the meaning completely changes . \ 
Guess you have to keep the rhyme . 
A person who I've contacted once about an apartment when I was moving to SLO ( and not again ) added me on LinkedIn . A person I didn't know tried to add me on facebook ( A real one , not one of those scammers)\ 
* is confused * 
The front < PROPFEMALE > of San < PROPFIRST > Groupon has a kid missing teeth holding out a surgery cake .... 
Good luck to everyone making a game in the Global Game Jam ! I look forward to playing some interesting games on Monday ! 
5 Hours Left in the Global Game Jam ! 
At Spring Awakening ! What a day ... 
After the second company bow , the audience was clapping so hard they had to come out for a third time . \ 
I don't usually pick tragedy over comedy , but the raw power that radiated off this show was a thing to behold . 
Pandora Censors its song titles . \ 
And so does YouTube's Auto-complete
