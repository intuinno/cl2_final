i think i found the meaning of life , for me of course everyone elses is subjective , i believe we were all meant to create something , or atleast leave evidence of our existance in one shape or another , of course to create is very subjective in itself , for me its to either create poetry , make a painting or sculpture but then again thats just me

Would you like to be one in a million ? Would you like to be one in five ? Would you like to know all the hidden meaning ? Before they tell you you've run out of time Would you like to be one in a million ? Would you like to be one in five ? When they tell you you ain't going nowhere When they tell you you can't live your life . 
i feel that everything that has happened in my life has already happened many times before , what if all the coincidences in life really are just the inability to realize the reocurance of ones life path ? what if every choice we make has already been made but we dont realise it ? i think if you have the ability to see the strings that guide our life , you have the ability to see the humour in it all

You share a basic personality configuration with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Bashir . People like you are generally great problem-solvers . You're highly innovative , creative and unique . You're optimistic by nature , which may make others believe you're naive , but actually you're full of energy , very clever , and determined not to be stopped . You're outgoing , curious , and extremely playful .

he described love for me Have you ever been in love ? Horrible isn't it ? It makes you so vulnerable . It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up . You build up all these defenses , you build up a whole suit of armor , so that nothing can hurt you , 
the futures uncertain , the end is always near 
What I learned out of the whole experience of the march is that it doesn’t matter who you are , what your name is or how old you are , what matters is what you represent . A whole , a body of whole , a protest is a voice that is breathless without representation . 
YEAH !!!!! GOT MY CLASSES HAHAHA ELEM STATS/PROBABILITY MTWRF 8:30 AM - 10:20 AM WORLD HISTORY 4.0 MTWR YOGA 0.5 MW 11:30 AM - 12:20 PM CLP 070 SELF ASSESSMENT

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy I don't mind , I think they're crazy Running everywhere at such a speed Till they find , there's no need 
I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it . There is , however , a class of fancies of exquisite delicacy which are not thoughts , and to which as yet I have found it absolutely impossible to adapt to language . 
Being so overtired , you have no idea what you're even saying anymore i became a fan , this is totally me tooo lol , i say interesting stuff too at this moment 
anytime you down just look up your name on urban dictionary < PROPFIRST > - He is a beautiful , terrible being . A destroyer of worlds . The conquerer of Earth . He is all that is man .

the whole concept of pregnancy fascinates me , the ability to < PROPFEMALE > a living human being inside a body is phenominal , interesting if you think about it , which i normally dont but its cool though , usually take it for granted too haha 
life feels like one < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > film after another and a pink < PROPMALE > album moment 
the wmst at san < PROPFIRST > state is rigged , i will not be convinced that it isn't , how can you tell me that you give 40 < PROPFEMALE > for an essay which takes 20 < PROPFEMALE > at < PROPMALE > to write , then give a standardized multiple choice test which is 40 which takes 60 at least ? total bullshit and then you get the feeling like : \ok so you did pass ewrt 1A but you didn't pass OUR ewrt1A course\ " just another way to nickel and dime " 
i love how i get spam mail talking about how easy it is to meet someone when in fact you actually reply to them and one of the repliers ask what you do for a living and where you see yourself in a few years , oh but wait whats even more rediculus is when they ask for your income level too , haha i guess i am a product , but wait 2.0 , lol < PROPFIRST > 2.0 
You can't remember where it was Had this dream stopped ? The snake was pale gold Glazed and shrunken We were afraid to touch it The sheets were hot dead prisons And she was beside me Old , she's no , young Her dark red hair the white soft skin Now , run to the mirror in the bathroom Look ! shes coming in here I can't live thru each slow century of her moving

why arnt people enthusiastic about voting for the incoming mid-term elections ? of course sometimes things may seem one sided or even corrupt , but sitting , pouting or even watching things happen around you , not being an active participant is shameful 
< PROPFEMALE > handlers hot and funny 
life really is the will to power it seems 
i want a goth/scene chick yum yum 
death of friendships almost feel like death itself 
i dont know how but i passed stats class ! i must have pulled that outa my ..... 
there was a lady who really gave me a hard time when i asked her if i could either talk to a < PROPFIRST > or an admin at school today . I could tell that she didnt want to work and give me the run around . all i needed was just a signature dude . a signature . anyways i got her supervisor to help me out , because she was just being lazy , i made it appoint to report her as being pompous and rude 
i found a sweater onthe ground while here at san < PROPFIRST > state , without thinking about it , something told me to pick it up and i did . i was thinking that i should probably give it to lost and found . later on as i walked by i saw that there was a homeless person sleeping , interestingly enough i put it on top of her bags . i wonder how she will feel about that when she wakes up ? hmm interesting lol 
living the jedi life style\ 
There is no emotion ; there is peace . \

There is no passion ; there is serenity . \ 
There is no death ; there is the Force . 
i know i passed the wst this time . the topic of our essay was to write about how we deal with those who share different points of view . it was stimulating and envigerating . it helps when you rethink the whole concept of assignment and change it to an informal interview . i think to myself : by god they really want to know my opinion . 
1 . stagnation = bordom = melancholy\ 
2 . intellectual stimulation = a < PROPMALE > to synthesize = epiphanies = a greater understanding and a new way of life = enlightenment 
you ever have a < PROPMALE > check out truth movements technology analogy really great stuff , it was inspired by pink < PROPMALE > and almost sound like amused to death but if it was a colaboration with < PROPFIRST > gilmour , beautiful and intellectually inspiring to those who have an open mind 
i actually passed a phone interview i guess i might have a new job in a couple of days hopefully it pays well , hoping for c o-o rdinator but i'm not complaining , might start working for a non-profit organization and be an < PROPFEMALE > to special needs students ! atleast 13 an hour but will try to negotiate to $15 hmmm

White light , White light goin ' messin ' up my mindWhite light , and don't you know its gonna make me go blindWhite heat , aww white heat it tickle me down to my toesWhite light , Ooo have mercy while I'll have it goodness knows\

thin that interview went well , interestingly when i had time to pay for classes , the place was closed . i guess they dont want they 600 i owe them 
goodbye 600 dollars , phew more where that came from , school geeeerrr 
life is such a short , feelting experience , and the only way we seem to live it is through fighting , killing , repressing ours and other peoples thoughts , holding each other back , opressing\ 
what irony \ 
tragedy 
i just realized that i live life like if i was in the 60's rather than the 21st century lol , man i was born wayyyy too late

life make you afraid from the get-go , afraid to be yourself , afraid to live , afraid to be , and when others notice those who aren't afraid , they get tarnished when really its just a projection of fear on themselves 
interesting to note that people take life too seriously , i have many principles but say random things while others i know have stupid principles but have many things to say \

Impassioned lovers\ 
Wrestle as one \ 
Lonely man cries for love\ 
And has none\ 
New mother picks up \ 
And suckles her son\ 
Senior citizens \ 
Wish they were young\ 
Cold hearted orb\

Removes the colours\

Red is gray and \

But we decide\ 
Which is right \ 
And \ 
Which is an Illusion 
Blue , blue , electric blue\ 
That's the colour of my room\ 
Where I will live\ 
Blue , blue\ 
Pale blinds drawn all day\ 
Nothing to do , nothing to say\ 
I will sit right down , waiting for the gift of sound and vision\ 
And I will sing , waiting for the gift of sound and vision\ 
Drifting into my solitude , over my head
