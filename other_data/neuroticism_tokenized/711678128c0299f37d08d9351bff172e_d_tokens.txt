i think my kneecap is somewhere in the front yard or driveway by now . it definitely is not any longer attatched to my leg . OMG i hit it so hard on the front door . it hurts !! 
HELP . i thought it would be interesting to see what my account looked like in chinese , so i chose chinese as my language . now , everything is in chinese characters and i don't know how to switch it back . 
i just can't get into it . 
finds my friends status updates WAY more interesting than my own . my life is more like ... lather , rinse , repeat .

why couldn't the tarheels play like they are tonight , last night ? 
bored . the buffering on youtube sucks tonight , so that's out . on the bright side , i did get another listing today . 
being relegated to the very edge of the bed by 2 VERY SPOILED DOGS . sure hope they have enough room .

i'm sure < PROPFIRST > bieber is every 12 year old girls dream , but to me he's just a little boy that needs to comb his hair . ( that can't sing ) 
will it be greedy of me when i win the mega millions tuesday night and then hit the powerball on wednesday ? 
' intexticated ' : driving recklessly while texting . guilty .

Now this is the kind of summer weather that I love ! 
grilled orange , < PROPFEMALE > pork chops or lime , chili flake pepper chicken ? decisions . decisions . 
you know what ? it's true ... sometimes good things do happen to those who wait ! a superfantastic month is happening for me in my world of real estate right here and now . ( my superstitious side tells me not to jinx myself - so .. salt over the shoulder , knock on wood , fingers crossed ) . 
< PROPMALE > gibson has little man syndrome - or is just a complete ass .

And , now you know ... 
if anybody needs me i'll be washing my gay windows . 
< PROPFIRST > left today to work in sacramento for 9 weeks . feels weird . 
what will this beautiful day bring ? 
i think that < PROPFEMALE > palin and < PROPFEMALE > o'donnell must have attended the same secretarial school/junior college/wizardry university ... and were the underachievers . 
loved the arches lit in deep purple tonight . 
off to the apple store to get my iphone fixed/replaced . ( maybe a free upgrade ? ) then an afternoon meeting with all my realliving realtor friends to find out what's \new and exciting \"..." 
rangers : for all of those miserable seasons that i sat in that radiator called arlington stadium , broiling and watching < PROPMALE > league t-ball - - PLEASE beat the yankees tonight !! 
having a late dinner , featuring grilled rib eye steak , bake potato , chessy brocolli and a delicious fresh salad of mixed greens . ( extra ab work out tomorrow to take away the guilt ) 
hello , rainy monday . 
is it my tv or does < PROPFEMALE > just have a messed up face in real life ? 
awww . Fluffy died . sad . 
does not feel well at all . no halloween for me this year - boo . 
fingers , toes and eyelashes crossed for a really good deal to come together . there are a lot of pieces , but i think i might just actually pull it off !!! 
okay . so eating a pomegranate is way to messy and way too much work . 
to any of my tea party or republican friends ; please defriend me . i can longer tolerate hatred , bigotry , greed and ignorance at this point in my life . thanks . 
... i did not know that < PROPFIRST > colbert was on strangers with < PROPFEMALE > . probably because i have never watched strangers with < PROPFEMALE > before . 
it's been a lousy week for sleep . hoping tonight is ' the night ' . and , < PROPFIRST > is home tomorrow for a one day visit after 3 weeks in california for work . can't wait to see him !!!!!! that's it . 
wow 
it's your favorite . chicken colada . 
just had a strange dream that i had an apartment that had 6 door exits with 4 dead bolts on each door , but none of the doors had handles and were hard to lock . just after i got them all locked , a friend opened one behind the fireplace and let my cat get outside , and it didn't bother him that i was pissed he wouldn't go look for the cat . wth ?!! 
holy guacamole .... 8-1 jackets win ! save some of those goals for a snowy day . 
realizing that boredom is a choice , but having a hard time not being bored right now . 
gator meat . tastes just like chicken . 
i don't understand the fascination with reality shows . from what i hear , the people that should win never win , so why bother watching something that has a determined outcome . seems like a waste of time ... nothing real about it . 
question : is there a way to remove all past posts in one click ? and past events ? 
one of dogs , kato , is giving me the staredown . which can only mean one thing .... let's go for a run . 
is really feeling ill . fever . chills . nausea . ugh ! 
nothing like a new contract to make you feel better and start the week . 
easy solution for anyone opposed to the body scan or \pat down\ " if you refuse .... don't fly . one of many things worse than gettin your \ " junk\ " touched is a bomb or weapon on an airplane . " 
uh oh . mercury is in retrograde . 
yay yay yay yay . picking up my baby tomorrow afternoon at 5:15 . can't wait to see him ! ( secretly needing/wanting someone to take care of these 3 extremely bad , spoiled-rotten boys for a few days) ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s plane got in 45 minutes early - gottta love that . so glad he's home ! happy thanksgiving everyone !!!! 
great weekend and holiday , but sad that < PROPFIRST > is on a plane back to california again . 
our boy < PROPMALE > turns 5 years old on december 1st . happy birthday < PROPMALE > !!! 
the first snow of winter is always pretty special . 
catching up on the dvr . i was being too lazy to fast forward through the commercials until i had to relive those #%^$ #ing political ads . 
hey blue jackets . it's called professional hockey . be nice if you showed up . 
came across a recently killed deer while walking with the dogs this morning . it reaffirms that i could never be a < PROPMALE > . all i felt was ... just sad . 
they should make a radio station for little 12 year old girls that plays < PROPFIRST > bieber songs and NEVER play that crap he sings anywhere else . eeny meany miney mo blah blah blah . shut up ! 
Thinking too much . My brain needs an off switch . 
am i just stupid , or is there no way to ' clear ' your status with the new layout . just always need to-post to get it to change ? 
chicken , bacon and mushroom risotto . i have outdone myself . YUM . 
with the exception of < PROPFEMALE > white , it seems < PROPFEMALE > walters and i have very different definitions of ' fascinating ' people 
okay . back to work . 
< PROPFIRST > is daycationing in san < PROPFIRST > and i am here cleaning the house . the universe is definitely out of sync . 
< PROPMALE > vitale . seriously . STFU ! 
i have no idea if this is a new or old song by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , but i heard ' peacock ' tonight and i love it . 
i am surprised that 10-tv news doesn't have maureeen kocot standing beside the freeway in a half inch of snow forewarning us of a pending apocalyptic 3\ snowfall . " 
i feel like cracking open this big bottle of wine and cooking all day . 
wow i will regret posting this because of the repercussions .... but i saw a really bad drag show tonight . i am no expert but i know bad when i see it ... hmmmm 
brrrrrr . 
i propose that the big 10 change its name to the nimwop conference . 
< PROPFIRST > comes home in 5 days !!!!!!!!!! 
off to write a contract . yay !! 
i'm thinking that it may be time to add a new little puppy to the household . 
one of the many things that is great about home-officing is that the snow looks a lot prettier from the window of your house than from the window of your car . 
gonna bake a chocolate cake . 
a really long and busy saturday is coming to an early end . g'night all . 
very thankful for all that i have , but my christmas list is long and has a lot of expensive items on it . 
had a great accupressure neck , back , and foot massage at the comfort zone while christmas shopping this afternoon and headed to hyde park for some cocktails this evening with the man and a few a friends . 
It's official . The Blue Jackets suck ! 10 years of mediocre , sloppy , uninspired hockey is too much to ask of fan support . Ownership needs to make a quality player acquisition or , not just this season , but the franchise will be history . 
everything looks good for a closing on thursday . ( large smile ) 
my last closing for 2010 is in the books . hoping for many , many more in 2011 .
