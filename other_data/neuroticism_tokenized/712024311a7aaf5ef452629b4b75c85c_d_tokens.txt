I GOT A < PROPFIRST > . :OOO 
The world is in your hands , or it's at your throat .. 
Pissed off doesn't even begin to describe it .. 
GREATEST ... DAY ... EVER ... for a really stupid reason . ^.^ 
The more I see , the less I know , the more I'd like to let it go .. 
Why not try it all , if you only remember it once ? 
Science flies rockets to the < PROPFEMALE > , Religion flies planes into buildings . PROUD ATHEIST . 
Gonna try to sleep , we'll see how that goes . -.- 
I don't care if they're singer is gay , < PROPFEMALE > is the BEST . 
I've made a decision . I will unerringly complete Master's Degree after Master's degree until I can understand EVERY LAST XKCD comic . 
Hey , you only live once .. 
Taylor : Everytime I burp , it tastes like penis . -.- 
Just finished outline , THANK PASTA .

Lord , 16 hours of raging at MW2 does a number to your throat . 
It's almost 1am and I'm still working on the Term Paper , procrastination WIN ! 
Hao can I create nuu groop ? 
Seriously , how do I create a new group ? 
My parents grounded me from Xbox and cancelled Live , but I can't blame them , I have an F in AP World History thanks to not doing the homework . :/ 
I am , in all seriousness , moving to Sweden permanately once I've finished enough tertiary education to not look like a raving moron around all the relatively cultured people there . 
School's got me depressed lately , not like little bitchy emo depressed , I just don't feel like doing anything anymore . 
/b/ died . I will be beyond bored for the rest of this grounding period . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Dawkins . 
Live ran out . Even though I brought an F up to a C , my dad decides it's still not good enough and takes Live away until school's out . His reason ? Because he said so . -.- 
It's a B- now . I wonder how long they'll keep this up . 
Just discovered the Fratellis . Someone pinch me . XD 
Has blisters on top of blisters from playing ball at EKU , its going to be hard to walk tomorrow .

I think what pisses me off more than Christians in general is how positive they are that they're 100% right , just because they're parents told them so . 
< PROPFIRST > Wallace > Shaka Zulu . TOLD YOU . 
I found a new respect for Christians after talking to < PROPMALE > Lyons today . At least they can follow a debate for more than fifteen seconds . 
I'm kinda considering something along the lines of there being a God who sort of set the big bang up , sat back , and watched things go down . It won't satisfy my Christian friends , but now people can stop thinking I'm a satanist for identifying as an Atheist . 
La Roux scares the hell out of me . 
I'm selling Modern Warfare 2 and Mass Effect 2 tomorrow , $25 each . 
Modern Warfare 2 and Mass Effect 2 , both for sale by me tomorrow at school , $25 starting price , can work down though . Also , I'll trade both for Halo : ODST . 
Alright , now I'm selling Mass Effect 2 and Bioshock 2 , both $25 . 
Hm , Phoenix is actaually good ! Thanks , Kehgan Ford . 
< PROPFIRST > Hubbs is a faggot . 
Oh my god , you all are retarded . Facebook will never cost money , seriously . I can't believe that many people are that stupid . 
DAT BASS BE BUMPIN ' . Damn I need friends . 
Homework ... or fun .... I CAN'T DECIDE . 
So < PROPFIRST > Hood was an awesome movie , everyone should go see it ! 
I have too many Republican Christian friends , which wouldn't be a problem if most of them didn't treat me like a pre-civil rights black person . 
< PROPFIRST > says : -.- You little eighth graders and your lack of musical taste\ 
\ 
< PROPFIRST > . says : o.o how'd you know what grade i was in ? 
Three coin flips , three tails in a row . \ 
Fate decided that I'm not doing my homework tonight . 
Everyone and anyone involved in OMR needs to check the group periodically for updates . 
Night Facebook ; I have to get up early . Also , I caught a spider and a moth , and I'm waiting to see who dies first . Might bring them to school .

To all of those who oppose Obama : What the fuck do you want him to do ? In the American government , no one has any fucking power . Everyone's just too damn tied up in regulations and relations to really make a difference . You think < PROPFIRST > Bush was to blame for the whole Iraqi war ? Did you forget that he can't do SHIT without the Congress approving it ? 
< PROPMALE > Gervais , the funniest comedian I know of . 
Oh , kill me now cause I let you down ; I swear one day , we're gonna leave this town ... STOP .

Hm , don't know what happened this year , but last time I checked NO ONE GIVES A FLYING SHIT BITCHTIT OF FUCK ABOUT SOCCER . 
I'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist , and I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit . 
No matter how stupid you think someone is , just remember there are like 20 people who think the same exact thing about you . 
Band-aids make barre chords easier . I've cracked the Arctic Monkeys ' secret . XD 
A pregnant guitar-pick monster exploded on my desk . They're fucking everywhere . Goodnight everyone .

THERE IS A FRANZ < PROPMALE > SONG FOR EVERYTHING . : l 
GOT ME A GUN , BY GOD . 
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up ? 
This gun is a pain to clean . 
Like this if you want me to lie to you . 
Who should I do that < PROPFEMALE > Letter project on ? 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > literally attracts Mexicans to stare at us . 
Killed my first squirrel today . :D Well , killing isn't the right term . Blew my first squirrel out of a tree and a good 15 feet backwards today ! :D 
My hobby : Quoting completely unrelated Bible verses in public .

Walking on the ground you're breaking , laughing that your life's wasting . 
Fallout : New Vegas sucks . 
Like this and I might start talking to you . I'm pretty bored . 
Most of you could die and no one would care . : l 
Naps fuck my schedule up . : l 
And suddenly you know , you're never going home . 
WHY IS THE FLAMETHROWER AN ASSAULT RIFLE ATTACHMENT ON BLACK OPS ? 
Shit , man . I love cock . 
The TT-30 shoots a 7.62 . : l 
Goddamn I love ruining peoples days . 
Anyone wanna let me borrow WaW tonight and tomorrow ? I'll come pick it up . 
Black Ops stole a lot of stuff from Reach , made it look better , made it work better , and gave us the M14 back . 
There's about three of you who aren't absolutely stupid as Hell . 
Man , the Colt M1911 . 45 ACP and the 7.62 M14 . Black Ops might be a disappointment , but at least it'll be a damn pretty one . 
You can bitch , you can cry , you can regret , you can think , you can complain , you can love , you can hope , you can lust , you can remember , you can try to forget , you can care , but you'll never feel as good as you do when you don't give a fuck . 
Also , to be honest , I'm not an asshole . I just don't pretend to fall for the stupid pathetic little attempts to hide how ignorant and melodramatic you all are ; and I make sure you fucking know that . Welcome to the shit .

You can't be in a bad mood after listening to < PROPFIRST > Hammond Jr. ' s first album . 
At < PROPMALE>'s house , taking turns playing Black Ops because the split-screen makes us terrible . 
Free from it all , I'm not gonna change till I want to .

I could be an inventor . I just fashioned a keychain from a broken guitar string with needle-nosed pliers and a wire-cutter . What's that , < PROPMALE > ? I can't hear you over my awesome new keychain . 
Greatest thing ever : My mom got into Eastern by drawing a pattern on her ACT . Didn't even read it . 
God I love Bioshock 
There is one thin line of beard that has eluded me for months . I always find it about an hour after shaving and spend the next three days having a mental crisis . 
Who's got two thumbs and found a full recording of the MSG Strokes on Youtube ? This guy . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Gray HEARTS EVERYWHERE . 
Hey < PROPMALE > . 
I know they want to go in a new direction and everything , but the absolute worst feeling in the world is the one I get when I realize The Strokes might never go back to their \Is This It \"- era style . " 
WOW . My Chemical Romance , Paramore , Green Day , and Disturbed are in the Musical March Madness Final Four . WHAT THE HECK , < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Hand to God , if BioShock doesn't give me PTSD , I'll start believing in Him . 
Xbox's warranty is expired and it decided to start malfunctioning . Awesome . 
All of the sudden , RAIN EVERYWHERE .

I need a new sub for my computer . 
Welp , time to check my Facebook one last time and then it's off to bed ! ( Forty minutes later ) WHAT HAPPENED TO TIME ?! 
If you play anything by the Black Keys , your facial hair grows twice as fast . True Story . 
English is the only language you can sing Indie music in . True Story . 
INTJ . The few ; the proud ; the megalomaniacal . 
Oh Ayn Rand , how you make me absolutely despise a person who's never lived , and most of those who have at the same time . 
My mother is absolutely dedicated to finding out reasons to discourage me from going to college . 
Man , if I had one wish , it'd be to go back and live as a gangster in the ' 20s and ' 30s . It'd be SOOO awesome . 
Got a new computer , minecraft time . 
This Hives tower will be AWESOME when it's finished . 
Tower's done , and has room for three people to use as a base , not including my penthouse suite . 
There needs to be a wipe that takes off all the grease from fast food off your hands , specially designed for guitarists . My strings are crying .

Jesus christ , what is this ? Be an awkward teenager week ? 
6 pm ? Time for a shower and my morning coffee . God I love < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm getting old , I'm already getting sleepy . : l 
I don't understand something . Does ' caps lock ' say something else to old people ? I mean , why do they always IMMEDIATELY toggle it any time they type a message ? 
Just got off work . My everything hurts . 
And now , < PROPFIRST > Atkins thinks I chill in glitter . Thanks paint . 
This may be the paint inhalation talking , but .... THE < PROPFEMALE > GEES . :3 
Yes , good job < PROPFEMALE > . Ten years , 5000+ < PROPFEMALE > n lives , trillions of dollars , and two embarrassing presidencies later and you finally killed an aging Muslim man . Bravo . 
EVERY TIME the song Apache by the Sugar Hill Gang comes on , I smile like a little girl . Seriously , try it some time . I can't control it .

Almost three hours now . 
Oh my God , finally . Five hours of work for a two minute movie . Sorry , group , that's all I could get out of it . 
I think it's about time I watched all the < PROPMALE > Potter movies . Thanks to Netflix , I can . 
I shaved . I don't even know who I am any more . 
Working today . My body says sleep , but my mind says money . Coffee will settle this . 
For example . Mini-me loves chocolate . < PROPFIRST > DON'T . 
Finished my paper on < PROPMALE > Capone . Going to go watch the last episodes of Scrubs . After tonight , I will have watched every episode of Scrubs ever . < PROPMALE > most makes me sad .

You know it's too early to start on your summer assignments when the resources haven't even been posted on the website yet . 
There are NEVER any bagels left . 
In anticipation for Skyrim ( albeit a little early ) , I started a new game on Oblivion . I intend to beat the main quest and Fighter's Guild , and possibly the Mage's Guild . This should be fun . 
Working from 9am to 1pm tomorrow , then a free week . Woooo . 
Halo 4 ? What's that ? Sorry , Skyrim's KINDA LOUD . 
Pet peeve of the day : People saying they're a senior the summer before senior year . We're not in school . Seniors are IN SCHOOL . Therefore WE =/ = SENIORS . 
Problem : I need new guitar strings , but the store I get mine from is closed . Solution ? 
Whatever People Say I Am , That's What I'm Not is my favorite album since Room on Fire . 
Missed a < PROPFEMALE > spot shaving . I think I might kill myself later . We'll see how the night goes . 
Pet Peeve #2 : When people title photo albums with one meaningful word . ( I.e. Life , Friends , [ Their name ] , Love , etc . ) 
Like this if you think I should grow my beard back out . 
Torrenting the new Arctic Monkeys album . Yes . 
Brick by brick . 
Home alone until Sunday ? Yes . 
God I hate < PROPFIRST > Moore-on . 
I like 11/12 of the tracks on the new Arctic Monkeys record . 
It's beautiful . Being 17 during the summer allows one to program their Circadian rhythms so that the morning ( sunrise ) happens halfway through their ' day ' ; I get to start my morning off completely awake and fully conscious . 
The organic molecules in my body are 4.6 billion years old ! TRUFAX . 
Something you'll notice now : Marketers have , instead of removing the annoying over-acted emotions of people in commercials , completely done away with backgrounds and settings . Seriously , count how many commercials you see where the actors are in a white , purgatory-like ' zone of cleanliness and purity ' . 
Three things you'll have learned after a night on StumbleUpon : 1 . The human psyche is very , very fragile . 2 . < PROPMALE > died in 1959 . 3 . Cats are adorable . 
Let's play chicken with sleep deprivation . 26 hours so far .

From now on , if I encounter someone listening to music loudly at school or in public , I'm going to approach you slowly , while explaining to you at a normal volume exactly what's about to happen . Then I'll physically harm you . There's a reason headphones don't have speakers on the outside too . 
< PROPFIRST > Frasure I was raised in Kentucky , where ' they ' pride themselves on being ignorant and intolerant ; where disagreements are settled with hard liquor and domestic violence , and where being anything but Southern Baptist will get you exiled from most social circles . Also where a mere 19% of people over the age of 25 have a college education . ( That's #47 in the country ) 
I just woke up . Wut . 
Idea I need to write down and happened to be on Facebook at the time : Get me and a bunch of guys to dress in 1920s-1930s stuff ( suits , trilbies , slicked hair ) and take a black and white picture of us walking down a sidewalk or something else cool . Caption : Original Gangsters . 
I might make fun of people for pretending to like Pokemon at this late in their teenage years , but I just found a Pokemon Gold emulator online and I can't stop . It's the music . It's reminding me of the time when I shut out the world beyond my mom's car and just played . 
TF2 > WoW . : l 
Archimedes ?! 
Working from 9 to 6 today . I need coffee . 
For the fourth time this week , my Steam has crashed and I must reinstall it and redownload TF2 , taking a total of 5 hours . 
To anyone involved : The server won't save right now , I disabled it . I'll enable it when I get back . You can still play on it , but nothing will be saved unless I come back and manually do it . 
Someone sell me Left 4 Dead ; I want the first one . 
Uneventful night , the only exception being when I was almost killed by a firework that fell over . 3 feet to the left , I'd have gotten a face full of fire . 
Netflix , I don't know who told you people liked the types of movies you have available for streaming , but they all suck .
