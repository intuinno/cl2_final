Rest In Piece < PROPFIRST > . :( 

is watching MJ videos with an enormous jug of Arizona Iced Tea next to me . 
And it's one more day up in the canyons , And it's one more night in Hollywood ... 
How many special people change , How many lives are living strange , Where were you when we were getting high ? 
R.I.P. < PROPMALE > Kennedy 1932-2009 ... 
just drove for the first time around the neighborhood . Almost hit a curb , but it's all good . 
Every time < PROPFIRST > Beck bitches about < PROPFIRST > Jones , God kills a kitten . 
No one should die because he or she cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because he or she gets sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
setting up new laptop ! 
gotta love start of college fb season 
I do believe Tate Forcier is Jesus Christ in a football uniform . 
< PROPMALE > Locker for Heisman 
TIGERS ! 
is watching Obama's AFL-CIO Picnic speech . If he can electrify like this on Wednesday night ( and I know he can ) , health reform WILL happen . 
is watching < PROPFIRST > Bourdain : No Reservations and listening to music while waiting for some college football to start . 
Freak out , and give in . Doesn't matter what you believe in . Stay cool , and be somebody's fool this year . Cause they know , who is righteous , what is bold . So I'm told . 
Dammit Obama , stop trying to reach out to Republicans ! They LOST the election . That means the people don't WANT their ideas . Quit trying to compromise and do it the way YOU want it , the way YOU talked about while campaigning . 
GO LIONS ! 
At least the offense and special teams looked decent ? 
From Texts From Last Night : ( 404 ): i hope kanye doesn't show up to < PROPFIRST > swayze's funeral . \ i'll let you get back to your funeral in a minute ... but < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > had the best death of the year . just sayinnn \"." 
Come on Washington ! As soon as I saw they were playing on the program guide , I said \They can BEAT USC . \"" 
has a cold . 
is sick . :( 
And I don't want the world to see me , cause I don't think that they'd understand . When everything's made to be broken , I just want you to know who I am . 
despises the Indianapolis Colts . 
< PROPMALE > Schultz is the man . 
LIONS WIN ! LIONS WIN ! 
is in Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time Family Band Solution . 
just watched Glee and enjoyed it . Don't judge . 
these Tigers are gonna put me in a coma . 
I'm so nervous right now , I feel like throwing up . 
kiss the division , the playoffs , and the season goodbye . 
Fuck yeah Dodgers ! I still haven't forgiven the Cardinals for 2006 . 
Fuck the Trojans . Where was the flag on the last play ? 
got his own Linksys wireless router last night . Had to turn the Comcast service back on . Actually got a competent customer service representative , and it's working ! Now and forever I will have wireless on my laptop . :D 
Those kids have no idea whatsoever of what went down at Stalingrad . 
\You're pissing on my bonfire ! \ " \ " There is no bonfire ! \ " \ " Because you keep pissing on it ! \"" 
they REALLY need to put a warning before those animal abuse commercials . 
FUCK . 
Hey < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Ford and < PROPFIRST > Mayhew : SIGN < PROPFIRST > CHAMBERS NOW . GIVE US A PLAYMAKER TO PUT NEXT TO < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
back from an Organizing for < PROPFEMALE > meeting in Brighton , and met everybody at the Livingston County Democratic Party . I've found my type of people ! 
Thanks for the Happy Birthdays everybody ! 
just got Madden 2010 as a late birthday present - it is amazing ! 
Hopefully haging out with < PROPMALE > Cece and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Tokai II tomorrow . 
just can't support the Tigers anymore .

RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . A talent who was trying to get his life back together , whose life was cut way too short . 
watching The Song Remains The Same on Palladia . If you have HD ( Palladia is an HD-only channel ) , I highly recommend it . It's a documentary about Led Zeppelin's concert at < PROPFEMALE > Square Garden in 1973 , and it is amazing . 
WTF New York Giants ? Up 38-12 against the Washington Redskins you pick fights then don't get penalized , then you continue to throw the ball to make it 45-12 ? Talk about douchebags . 
is waiting for the first season of Glee to finish downloading . Try not to judge too much . 
Doesn't wanna be here right now . 0 
Twilight Zone ( original ) marathon on Sci-Fi ( still think the other way to say it is stupid) ! 
My prediction for the second half of Jets/Bengals : With Coles and Caldwell hurt , if Cincy comes back to win this game , QUAN COSBY will be the breakout < PROPFEMALE > . Take it to the bank . 
Apparently , my parents think < PROPFEMALE > Arbor is dangerous . My brother is a big boy at 16 , I think he can handle being there ( with others mind you ) at merely 11 at night . 
My heart goes out to the people of Haiti . I only wish that I had money to donate to the relief efforts . And also , Rush Limbaugh and < PROPFIRST > Robertson are pieces of shit . Actually , that's an insult to all pieces of shit out there . 
Just saw < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > tase himself with a disposable camera . 
has made a ridiculous amount of phone calls for < PROPFEMALE > Coakley . 
Game over . The seat held by < PROPFIRST > Kennedy for forty seven years , will now be occupied by a right-wing , phony , sexist , disgusting piece of shit Teabagger . What the fuck < PROPFEMALE > . 
I don't understand why a physician who performs abortions needs an armed guard , while Wall Street executives , arguable at least indirectly responsible for the deaths of many tens of thousands through their role in preventing health care reform and promoting imperialist wars and foreign policy that ignore the suffering of the many , are rewarded . 
just got a haircut ! 
GO SAINTS ! 
You know you watch too much late night television when the minute you hear the opening guitar riff , you reach for the remote without even looking at the screen , because you already know it's that shitty fucking Extenze infomercial . 
Virg Bernero running for governor ... hell yes ! 
Excited to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > later today !!! 
Just finished a delicious lunch with my bros < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Locke ! 
Watching Olympics ( figure skating currently ... lol ) with < PROPFIRST > Myers 
This was to be expected . < PROPFIRST > Brown voted for cloture on this jobs < PROPMALE > along with a few other moderate Republicans , and the reich-wing freaks out and gets all butthurt . I find it hilarious that they expected some braindead teabagger from a state like Massachusetts . Good on you , Senator Brown . You voted in the interests of your state . The rest of the Repukes out there will just have to bend over and deal with it . 
Fucking PUMPED for USA vs Canada ! 
Well fuck . Wish it would have been a different result , but it was a hell of a hockey game . Congratulations to Canada . I wish it could have been ANY other Canadian player to score though . It could have been Nash , Iginla , or Getzlaf , but it just HAD to be < PROPFIRST > Crosby . Because it's him , the media will < PROPMALE > it as the greatest play ever . 
Can someone just kill < PROPMALE > Bunning already ? 400,000 Americans are losing unemployment benefits because of this shit stain . All this , because a mere $10 B would be added to the deficit . Like that amount of money even matters right now . I wish he would've been hit by a line drive in the head during his baseball career , this world could use one less dickhead in it . Or maybe he was , which is why he's so god damned stupid . 
Lions signed DE < PROPFIRST > Vanden Bosch . I love this move . He may not be well known , but he was a really good player for the Tennessee Titans . Our Head Coach < PROPMALE > Schwartz used to be Tennessee's Defensive Coordinator , so this is a player familiar with the system and upgrades our defensive line instantly . Great start to free agency by Detroit . 
Holy shit , get well < PROPMALE > Stuckey . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > should have won that game ! Villanova fouled them at the end , but it didn't get called . Bullshit . 
Well , 23-9 in my NCAA Tournament brackets after the first round . Not bad , except for Louisville's loss fucking up the South region of the bracket . 
Good weekend overall . Had a great time at Tokai's house last night , Korie Lucious draining the three to vault the Spartans to the Sweet 16 , and a not great , but decent health care < PROPMALE > passing the House . 
\Democrats in < PROPFEMALE > were put on earth to do one thing : drag the ignorant hillbilly half of this country into the next century . \"" 
has decided to throw all of his support to the Tea Party movement . 
time for some rom NBA Jam ! 
Tigers kicking some ass . 
1-0 baby ! Fantastic win . 
Tigers 2-1 ! 
Tigers 2-1 ! Thrilled to see Dontrelle < PROPMALE > pitch well ! 
Bwahaha ... Bart Stupak retires ! I must say , good riddance fucker ! Although I do wonder if this is a cheap cop-out to avoid investigation into his C Street connections ... 
Tigers 3-1 ! 
DETROIT MOTHER FUCKIN ' TIGERS !!!!! 
Yes ! Montreal up 1-0 in the series . 
Officially moved into the new house . I got the basement converted into an amazing room , complete with Super F'n Nintendo hooked up ! We couldn't get an appointment for the cable guy to come until Thursday , so I'm without internet except for this card , which I have to conserve for the next few days . 
Rest in Peace < PROPFIRST > White . You'll be missed . 
JAHVID MOTHER FUCKING BEST ! 
Go Habs Go ! 
20 minutes to hold a 1 goal lead . Let's do this Habs ! Way to step it up for Game 7 ! 
The Bleu , Blanc , and Rouge have taken down the big bad Capitals ! 
All aboard the D-Train ! 
Something I've thought about with the new immigration law in Arizona being passed . Why couldn't we form a North American Union with Canada and Mexico ? It would facilitate free movement of goods/services , capital , and PEOPLE . Doesn't that seem like a more viable solution than asking people who look Mexican for their papers or commonly talked about \round them up and ship them back to Mexico \"?" 
is pretty much an enormous idiot . 
had a good sleep , and is feeling much better . 
Watching British election coverage . I'm such a nerd . 
2-0 ... 40 minutes away from the Eastern Conference Finals ... 
This game is a disaster ! How can you not get even one goal against Leighton ? Is this how the Capitals felt when Halak was dominating them ? 
Congratulations to Congressman < PROPFIRST > Sestak , for knocking off < PROPMALE > Specter in the Senate Democratic Primary Election in Pennsylvania ! And congratulations to Lt . Gov . < PROPMALE > Halter , for keeping close enough to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > in the Primary Election in Arkansas to force a runoff election ! 
If corporations are people , can we give BP the death penalty ? 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Lima . It will always be \Lima Time\ " in our hearts . " 
< PROPFIRST > FUCKIN ' GIONTA ! 
Thanks to the great season , Canadiens de Montreal . You gave us 19 amazing playoff games , and made April and May that much more enjoyable . Rest , regroup , and come back even stronger for the 2010-2011 season . \ 
\ 
( And as much as it pains me to say it , congratulations to the Flyers . Any team who can come back from being down 3-0 like they did last round against Boston earns my respect . ) 
If you could reason with conservatives , there wouldn't BE any conservatives . 
The constant complaining \ 
about illegal immigrants , saying they get free health care , free food , \ 
free social security ... WTF are they talking about ? Most \ 
people who are illegal don't want to go anywhere near a government \ 
agency for fear they'd be caught . Most people who are legal and \ 
need help can't even get it . But somehow these illegals are getting SS cards and collecting from American tax \ 
dollars ? Sure ...

The 2011 NHL Winter Classic ( outdoors ) game is Penguins vs . Capitals ? WTF < PROPFIRST > Bettman ? Of course you would pick your two < PROPFEMALE > boys . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
\Oh he's out ! Why is he safe ? \ " - < PROPMALE > Allen . \ 
Getting ready to go to the Volunteer Summit ! Can't wait to see < PROPFIRST > Cartier , Walnut McGangsta , < PROPFEMALE > Gillingham , < PROPFEMALE > Evans Kaier , and < PROPFIRST > Money ! 
\What does that do ? Does that blow your mind ? That . Just . HAPPENED . \"" 
Tonight confirms what I've long tried to deny to myself . The elections in this country are nothing but a sham . A farce . A show . 
I feel like the < PROPMALE > of my world , haters can make like bees with no stingers , and drop dead ... 
The Gulf disaster has made one thing clear to me : it's LONG past time for high speed rail ! 
Tigers losing 1 0-0 . >_< 
Make that 10-2 . Somewhat better . Brennan Boesch is a BEAST . 
Why can't conservatives get it through their thick skulls that when you're in a recession , YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO INCREASE GOVERNMENT SPENDING ? 1.2 million people are going to lose unemployment benefits tomorrow , with no hope of jobs anytime soon . Are they just supposed to starve or be homeless ? What do you want them to do ? Apparently if you're a Republican or a Conservadem , you tell the unemployed to \fuck off \"." 
Congratulations to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for throwing a No-Hitter ! Always great to see a former Detroit Tiger do something special . 
Just got a last.fm account . If you have one , post a link on here/add me as a friend if you wish ! \

FUCK 
dammit Ghana ... 
is a moron . I can't figure out how to turn on the lawn mower . 
Fireworks being set off on July 12th ? Fucking really ? 
You can keep knockin ' , but won't knock me down . No love lost , no love found . 
30 Rock with < PROPFIRST > Myers ! 
Certainly , in the topsy-turvy world of heavy rock , having a good solid piece of wood in your hand is often useful . 
Forget this ! Fuck the napkin ! 
\Can I raise a practical question at this point ... are we gonna do Stonehenge tomorrow ? \ " \ 
Just cast my ballot for the first time ever for Virg Bernero and < PROPMALE > Enderle !!! 
wishes he knew the outcome of < PROPMALE > Enderle's write-in campaign . Anybody have totals for that race ? 
CONGRATULATIONS VIRG BERNERO ! ONTO NOVEMBER !!!!! 
Proposition 8 ruled unconstitutional by California Supreme Court ! Yes ! 
has felt like shit yesterday and today . I took a bunch of medicine , now I'm gonna listen to The Doors and try to get some sleep . 
STILL feels like crap . Ugh . 
I love it when people send disparaging text messages anonymously like a bitch , because they know that in real life , I'd destroy them . 
Looking forward to the Democratic Convention tomorrow ! Unfortunately , I couldn't make it for day 1 . 
Félicitations < PROPMALE > St. < PROPMALE > ! Finally made it to the big leagues after 13 years in the Detroit Tigers minor league system . Hope he gets some playing time in tonight's game . 
< PROPFEMALE > in Chains MTV Unplugged . 
D-Rob's makin the start at QB for the Maize and Blue ! 
Denard Robinson had 100 yards rushing ... in the FIRST QUARTER . 
\Its got its own logo ! \ " - me last night " 
Trailer Park Boys has to be the funniest show I've ever seen . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Gorecki < PROPFIRST > Sight You guys wanna do a fantast league ? 
< PROPMALE > FUCKIN ' CABRERA ! 
How can you not score a run after getting a leadoff TRIPLE ?! 
The Tigers have an awful bullpen . 
Less than two hours to kickoff baby ! Lions all the way ! 
is dejected for at least the next four days . 
Get well soon < PROPMALE > Stafford . Heal that shoulder and come back stronger than ever . Until then , are you ready for the < PROPFIRST > Hill < PROPFEMALE > ? * cringes a bit * 
In July , < PROPFIRST > Rogers voted against The < PROPFIRST > Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act . Zadroga was a Police Detective that died at age 34 from a respiratory disease contracted at Ground Zero . The < PROPMALE > would have provided free health care and compensation to 9/11 rescue workers . This is despicable , and not the representation we the people of MI's 8th District deserve . That's why we need to support < PROPMALE > Enderle for Congress ! 
Fuck influenza . 
SPARTY ! 
Go Lions ! 
LOL , I just noticed that the battle between the starting running backs in tonight's Monday Night Football game is going to be Bush vs . Gore . I'm such a political nerd . 
I'm gonna make an attempt at philosophy at 5 AM . I found myself feeling nostalgic about stuff from like two months ago . They say that nostalgia is the ability to look back and forget the things that sucked . Well , I think that we should start forgetting about the things that suck in the present , because two months from now , we'll be doing exactly that . 
If < PROPFEMALE > stopped being so socially regressive , who would be harmed ? If this country stepped out of the dark ages and finally gave all of its people full rights , who would suffer ? If we all were to be able to experience equality , who would this be bad for ? Well , really , it's only one type of person , and that's the bigots of our society . 
Tigers ! 
is pretty disgusted with the teacher-bashing lately in the mainstream media's \discussions\ " about education . Blaming all teachers when students fail is like blaming all doctors when patients die . Privatization of schools is not the answer . Schools would become just like the health insurance system - focused on their bottom lines over human needs . " 
Why am I so fucking horrible at life ? 
If somehow there is a god , he enjoys seeing Lions fans suffer immensely . 
I was in the car , and we passed by the Livingston County Republican Party's headquarters . There was a sign out by the road that called it a \Victory Center\ " . How fucking cocky and condescending is that ? We need to teach them a lesson come November . " 
Loving these Detroit Lions ! 
< PROPFIRST > Myers and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > just set off the smoke detector . Such tards . 
If you are still undecided about who to cast your ballot for on November 2nd , please take a look at < PROPMALE > Enderle for Congress and Virg Bernero For Governor . Both are fantastic candidates ! 
Watching \The Assassination of Dr. Tiller\ " documentary on msnbc . The domestic terrorists that call themselves the \ " pro-life movement\ " by bombing clinics and killing doctors are some of the sickest fucks on the planet . " 
People me and my friends know really need to stop passing away , Life is way too short , and it seems that the good die young . RIP < PROPFIRST > Nance . Remember when in middle school , you would be pen pals with an elementary schooler , and you would tell them what middle school was like ? Believe it or not , < PROPFIRST > was my pen pal , though I doubt he'd remember that . You'll be missed greatly . 
Just voted ! Interesting note : my dad , who normally votes straight Republican , told me he voted for < PROPMALE > Enderle for Congress , and < PROPFEMALE > Benson for Secretary of State ! 
To those of you who haven't done so yet , VOTE ! Virg Bernero For Governor , < PROPMALE > Enderle for Congress , < PROPFEMALE > Benson for Michigan Secretary of State , < PROPFIRST > Leyton for Attorney General , Justice < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > for Michigan Supreme Court , Judge < PROPFEMALE > Langford < PROPMALE > for Michigan Supreme Court 
Ugh . Rand < PROPFIRST > is making the most pandering , vomit-inducing speech ever . 
Feingold is projected to go down right now . What the fuck . Sestak and Giannoulias , please < PROPFEMALE > on . 
IL Senate called for < PROPMALE > GOD FUCKING DAMMIT 
< PROPFEMALE > Senate called for Toomey . I give up forever . 
Gooooooooo Lions !!! 
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK 
Thanks everybody for the birthdays ! It's very much appreciated ! :-) 
OMFG so fucking disappointed that the Lions couldn't pull out the victory . 
Nothing like some Zeppelin to brighten up a cloudy day . 
At Epcot !

Finally home , after twenty hours in the car . Can't wait to sleep in my own bed . 
We're gonna have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with < PROPMALE > fuckin ' < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Updating this status from my BRAND NEW IPHONE !!! 
You tell all your little friends , that NOBODY escapes The Duker ! 
All the wold's indeed a stage , and we are merely players , performers and portrayers . 
< PROPFEMALE > Bachmann is on the House Intelligence Committee . Shouldn't a requirement be that you actually have intelligence ? 
Glad to see the Seahawks pull off the upset ! Now , GO JETS ! 
Fun times with @ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Fuck Auburn .
