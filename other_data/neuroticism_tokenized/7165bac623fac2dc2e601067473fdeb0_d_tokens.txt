Ladron . Thief . Out dancing Friday night . We left the club & there was a guy < PROPMALE > bing our truck after breaking the window . He took off with the girls ' purses , jackets and GPS . I was off in hot pursuit and chased him down in the woods behind the club . Once he was caught he pulled a knife and some mace . I disarmed him and held him until the police came and took him away . He sure picked the wrong car to < PROPMALE > .
