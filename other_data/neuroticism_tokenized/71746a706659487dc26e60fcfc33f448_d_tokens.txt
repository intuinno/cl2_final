When you make a mistake admit it , I will think of you higher if you do , otherwise don't waste my time ! 
Retarded calls today- nothing like asking the same ? ' s over and over and in different variations . 
Peeps are so retarded if you say look don't say anything that doesn't mean go and tell everyone_ just maybe someone wanted to keep in private ... retards .... 
Mentally & Emotionally exhausted .. 
What we gave little man was a trip to New Port Ky we stayed @Wildwood hotel and had fun . 
Why is it people are trained to only think of the here and now . Retards . What choices you choose effect you're future .

Big step back . Crap ... shhhhh guru 
Egh- morons out every _where ... 
Saw the new < PROPMALE > Potter movie _imax- style 20 minutes early and a huge line to see it _ over all good times . 
Manny has spelling test Tuesday instead of Friday .. That means 20 words plus bonus and 5 juicy words ...... spelling word's example _wampanoag , cornucopia _ 
Brrrr it's a bit chilly ! 
Then , when walking down the street , I saw a child with eyes of blue ; he stood and watched the others play , it seemed he knew not what to do ; I stopped a moment , then I said , ' Why don't you join the others , dear ? ' He looked ahead without a word , and then I knew he could not hear . Oh God , forgive me when I whine , I have two ears , the world is mine . 
I have noticed that all the creepy people decide to come out and walk when St < PROPFIRST>'s School let's out 
We placed our tree up last Sat . night ... But it seems like we have to keep placing bulbs on the tree - Darn Warewolf !! 
Snow- ugh ! 
At exchange site to pick up Manny since 5:20 finally 623 he shows up 
Busy night Saturday _ two kids that appeared high hit an electric pole and sled to a stop in front of our home .. kids were okay _car back side smashed in bad ...

ASK ME HOW MUCH SLEEP I HAD LAST NIGHT _HARDLY ANY DUE TO SOMEONE SNORING AND SLASH SNORING !! 
Thank God for trials _and experiences even when they suck it helps us see what we want or don't! 
It's a horrible spot to be in watching people or loved ones making decisions thinking there doing the right thing when there only hindering the ones they love .
