Wtf ! JFK is dead ? 

My philosophy is if won't move set it on fire . It may not help the situation , but atleast it will look cool untill u can come up with a better idea . 
I bet that this farmers tan from work would go great with a mullet , a random rock n roll tattoo , beer in hand , and nascar . 
I was just called a weenie woker ...... dunno what that is but it sounds dirty . 
Everything in life are small pieces of a large puzzle , and I'm having fun solving it . 
So is it just me being paranoid or do other ppl get the vibe that certain elderly ppl seem to despise my youthful vigor like in some way they are upset with me for being young and energetic and they arnt . Don't shoot daggers @ me :( its not my fault I sware ! ........ or is it ? 
So can any1 guess what accent I'm typing in ? 
Is sick of being alone and bored all the time . 
Working tomorrow ..... no fun . Atleast hot chicks like plants . 
Is going to hit up the comedy house and watch some friends preform some improv its going to be great ! 
Had an awesome time @ the comedy house the friends I went to see won ..... now I just need to get some friends i used to < PROPFEMALE > out with to join me next time . 
Here's somthing that's been bouncing in my head . 
Cxxxxx( =========> Thunder ! Cxxxxx( =============> Thunder ! Cxxxxx(o) ==================> THUNDER CATS HOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I'm not crazy ! I know cause I'm not wearing a tin foil hat . I used all of that making this bitchen tin foil tux . I'm going to the night club with < PROPMALE > and Hitler tonight . That's 40 points ! 
You only get one shot at life . Better make it count . Its not how many ppl u know in life but how many ppl will remember that counts , and racking up the points here ! 
If I moved were should I go ? 
So u know ur getting old when ur buying groceries and ur going mMmMm to things like Raisin bran & Chex Mix . 
Going to lexington fri-sun . Who wants to < PROPFEMALE > out ? Best offer wins ! 
Had good time with my friends . Wish I could do it more often . U can make new friends and lose old ones but , they are never replacable . 
Yaaaaaargah !...... pretty good < PROPFIRST > Depp impression right ? 
Going out this weekend . Ill be in the swansea area prolly hit up longnecks for a beer and a few games of pool . 
@ the doc find out what wrong with me . 
Sublime ! Nuf sed ...... 
Sick yet again ........ I should move to canada . 
I don't know why but I'm in the mood for some incubus . 
@ the river dogs game . 
Wish all my friends lived here in < PROPMALE > town . Hanging out with them this weekend was fun . 
Trust me with enough fire anything is flammable . 
Chillin , and bored outta my mind jus waiting for the weekend to be over with ..... 
Working , passing the time , and just waiting for somthing fun to do . 
No matter what situation ur in and how bad u think it is remember it could always be much worse .
