Just follow the smoke , they're bringing bottles of the Goose . And all the girls in the corner gettin ' loose . Screw rehab , I love my addiction ! No sleep , no sleep , I'm always on a mission . ' Cause I can't stop partying , partying ...

We didn't start the fire\ 
It was always burning\ 
Since the world's been turning\ 
No we didn't light it\ 
But we tried to fight it . 
And I was sick with heartache\ 
And she was sick like < PROPFEMALE > Hepburn when I met her . \ 
But we would both surrender\ 
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down . \ 
Don't ever turn it down . 
Slightly Stoopid and Cyprus Hill ( and Collie Budz ) tomorrow ! Can't wait ! 
Loneliness gets old after awhile . And embarrassing . 
Did I just post something from my Wii ?! I never knew you could do that ! 
\It's like watching someone ski moguls 
So much pain may come our way . \ 
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say . \ 
When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat , \ 
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me\ 
then I'll say girl\ 
if you're wondering if I want you to , \ 
I want you to . \

Let's dance in style , let's dance for a while\ 
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies\ 
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst\ 
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not ? \ 
Let us die young or let us live forever\ 
We don't have the power but we never say never\ 
Sitting in a sandpit , life is a short trip\

Moving to Ithaca soon ? Sounds good . 
Heroism on command , senseless violence , and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them ! 
Not that we needed all of that for the trip , but once you get locked into a serious drug collection , the tendency is to push it as far as you can .
