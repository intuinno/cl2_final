Don't you just LOVE being hyper ? 

I just accidentally posted something on somebody's face book < PROPFEMALE > because they clicked the remember me thing and hes connected to a bunch of SERIOUS people and i posted a video game ... i removed it but my tip is , if you live or < PROPFEMALE > out in a house for a while DO NOT click the remember me button unless your sure they wont get on your computer ... 
WHAT CHANNEL IS VMAS ?!?!? I TOTTALY FORGOT ! 
i hear everyone talking kanye and < PROPFIRST > and i dont think its that harsh he didnt say hers was better but i still think he shoulda said like honerable mention or like if there was a 2nd place or atleast a more polite . i mean that way there wouldnt be as much fuss as < PROPFEMALE > hudgens vs < PROPMALE > cook i think ? (btw that was rude and 20x ruder than this )
