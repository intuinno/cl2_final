Just found out < PROPFIRST > and I got the job in Alaska . We both start on May 1st . 
People need to understand that special needs children don't have an illness , they are not looking for a cure only acceptance . 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this ~ will you be in the 7% that will and leave it on your status for at least an hour . Special Education week March 22nd to the 26th 
Leaving for Alaska tomorrow . I will miss y'all . 
Just landed in Anchorage with 5 hours to kill before our flight into Kodiak . 
The three of us have arrived and are fighting the Jet lag valiantly . Going to explore the island and look for an apartment ! 
Just worked my first shift at < PROPFIRST>'s Great Alaskan Restaurant ... and so it begins ! 
Just finished a 14 hr shift ( it is 4:21 am here ) and back in at 3pm . Egads ! 
Just finished with 41.25 hours on the week ... tomorrow is my first day off since last Wednesday . 
I just logged somewhere in the ballpark of 107 hours over the last two weeks ... looking forward to that paycheck . 
Just got home from work and picked up my check ... $ 1,145 . 67 . Not too shabby for two weeks of work . 
Happy Fourth Everyone !

Watching The Munsters .... such a great show . 
Leaving for the Airport in about an hour . Headed home to Maine for the next 5 weeks ! 
After our first flight was cancelled and the next flight was delayed , we finally made it off of the Rock and have made it to Seattle . We have an overnight layover here and will be departing at 8:30 for < PROPFIRST > . Should be home late tomorrow night . 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !
