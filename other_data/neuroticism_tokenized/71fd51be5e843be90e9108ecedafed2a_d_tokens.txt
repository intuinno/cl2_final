I sometimes react to making a mistake as if I have betrayed myself . My fear of making a mistake seems to be based on the hidden assumption that I am potentially perfect and that if I can just be very careful I will not fall from heaven . But a ' mistake ' is a declaration of the way I am , a jolt to the way I intend , a reminder I am not dealing with the facts . When I have listened to my mistakes I have grown .
