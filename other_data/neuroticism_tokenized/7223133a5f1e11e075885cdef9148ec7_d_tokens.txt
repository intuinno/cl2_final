did something * wrong * to my back ..... am heartily sick of ice and pain . 

leaving at O'dark-thirty tomorrow for beautiful downtown Visalia 
we're all checked in to the Microtel in tulare leaving at 5 to go catch dinner and go to Formal Opening 
our girls kicked b *** at the Volleyball competition and won both games today .... next competition is on Saturday checking in at the Hotel was loads of fun .... 
so .... its Grand < PROPFEMALE > 2009 .... our Grand < PROPFEMALE > Officer to-be is absolutely beside herself with excitement 
says ... oh my .... not sure I'm gonna survive this .... first of three mornings and I can barely move . it IS for the girls ... frozen bottle of water serving as improvised icepack . 
thinks she may be caught up on sleep from GB ..... 
... wishing it were still the weekend ! 
thus ends day 2 --- sunburned and tired 
we walked ALL OVER the \downtown\ " area found some neat stores --- including Rythm Fusion and several \ " Fair Trade\ " places " 
started the morning back on the Boardwalk .... we DID ride the carousel and the ferris wheel , but avoided the Big Dipper , since I won't be back near my Chiropractor until next week .... watched Cirque Manifique and then headed to the old \downtown\ " area " 
We got into town , found our home for the next couple of days , and went for dinner .... it's been a LOOOONG time since we went to The Rainforest Cafe ! then we went for another little walk .... We just got back from Pier 39 .... were I'm pretty certain we 
This morning we enjoyed a peaceful breakfast in the < PROPFEMALE > eating area of the Adobe , packed up , and said good bye to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > -- for a while -- and headed up the coast on hwy 1 .... found the SF zoo and walked all over it . < PROPMALE > and Garfunkel were right 
Know what ? 100+ year old buildings are kinda noisy and cold 
today we went back to < PROPFEMALE > Gate Park and visited the Academy of Sciences --- which would have been MUCH less disappointing if it hadn't been field trip day for about 4 dozen day camps ! the Conservatory of Flowers was a delight , as was the Botanical Gar 
We arrived in Sebastopol yesterday afternoon and surveyed our friends ' domain . I had seen it before , but < PROPFIRST > hadn't --- and things have changed since I saw it last . < PROPFEMALE > prepared a delicious dinner for us , and our 27th year was completed . 
the statue of Tut when he took the throne didn't look like a < PROPMALE > to me --- it looked more like someone who should be in cub scouts . I was amused that games were included in his treasury --- I guess he liked games and they wanted to be sure he could cont 
Parking was a challenge ! But we DID find parking both nights , within a block of the door . No small feat , since the two spaces right in front , and the next one , were marked NO PARKING due to construction next door !! 
. As an aside : who decides to put in a Bed and Breakfast without parking ??? What kind of hair-brained response to the query about parking is “Oh , there is usually parking on the street” ??? really ??? Two hours only between 8am and 9pm ? ( and not AT 
We woke up realizing that the muni busses come by REALLY often , and that our insulated windows have spoiled us . Breakfast with the pleasant finch noises was nice , though . We packed up and headed off , before the parking time limit caused a problem 
FRIDAY --- \A\ " day ..... 27 years " 
Then we went into Sebastopol and had a late lunch and did some browsing and some shopping . Tonight we are all going out to dinner to a little local Italian place . 
We left the house around 1:30 and went to check out “Native Rider” a local store that carries < PROPFEMALE > Leather , as well as locally produced leather items , feathers , beads and stones . 
She has joined a web community of knitters and crocheters and has her “stash” photographed and logged --- as do all of the other people who participate in “Ravelry” ( ?? I think that’s what its called ) --- they have pictures of their finished pro 
Saturday has been a lazy day .... we woke up late ( well , ** I ** woke up late – < PROPFIRST > got up earlier and went into town for coffee and breakfast ! ) and < PROPMALE > around the house for a while . < PROPFEMALE > shared more of her latest obsession .. and I DO mean OBSESS

dear pain , \ 
thank you for letting me know I'm alive . message received . you can leave now . 
just re-read a book I read in elementary school : \We Have Always Lived in the Castle\ " by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . That I found this in the school library is somewhat astonishing --- at least in light of what was available in my kids ' school library . " 
Purchased a book I remembered from the same Elementary School Library : \Beastly Boys and Ghastly Girls\ " .... I led SUCH a non-PC life ! [ pity the poor kids today ] " 
GREAT .... new phone -- \multi-media\ " .... so how do I use this silly thing ? "

Kaity's car decided that motion was optional .... it is enroute to Bugformance [ the VW specialty shop ] for the SECOND TIME TODAY ..... I leave shortly to pick her up from school and drop her at work .... getting from work to Bugformance or home or whatever is TBD ..... \ 
at least life isn't BORING 
we did not go to Drum Circle last night waiting to hear from Kaity about the bug -- and whether or not she needed a ride\ 
there was no news last night - other than Kaity needing a ride home -- at 9 -- so we could have gone to Drum Circle after all .... she finally heard about the car today\ 
there is no joy in mudville\ 
Bugformance says something about maybe needing to rebuild the engine ...... 
Kaity says : \ 
lesson for today : oil in a car is not like gas , your car will not be \ 
fine until it is completely out . Apparently it absolutely NEEDS to have \ 
at least a quart of oil in it at all times or else bad things happen . 
* sigh*\ 
wonderful visit about to end ..... 
we're home again ..... and tonight , it is DRUM CIRCLE time .... join us if you can !! 
just found out that the little stunted dragon I adopted has MITES ! good thing I believe in quarantine , huh ? ..... now .... what cures mites ? research to do !

and more of the garden is planted and sprinklers ' installed'\ 
and we're working on the living room and kitchen -- the end is in sight !! 
our friend , < PROPFIRST>'s brother-in-law passed away .... and he is feverishly getting ready to go to NC to be with his sister . So a bunch of the more delicate reptiles moved in for the duration . I've never taken care of a hatchling sulcata before ..... this should be interesting .....

We suggest that you go to Harvest Festival in San < PROPFIRST > -- was smaller than anticipated in Pleasanton . Off to our Nephew's wedding today :) 
I understand my friend's term \cocooning\ " now .... " 
I need a nice rainy day .... I want to snuggle up under a blanket and read .... all day ! 
< PROPFIRST > took today off ..... so we're spending it together ( sort of ) ..... more sorting and sifting amid getting ready for the first Pack meeting of the school year [ < PROPFIRST > ] and laundry and yard stuff [ me ] ..... kind of like an extra Saturday for the week ..... 
Two packrats should NEVER live in the same place for 23 years --- the more we sort the more we find . it is AMAZING how much we have managed to ' store away ' around here !

Dear\ 
Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers \ 
starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save\ 
much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down \ 
congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an \ 
increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take\ 
no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree 
one of my FAVORITE things to watch ...... Autumn leaves tumbling in the wind ...... simply beautiful !! 
I managed to be BOTH places .... left Installation right after the ceremony ( sadly skipping the reception and thus the visiting / catching up time ) and drove [ safely ] to my Herp Club's annual meeting , arriving just in time to hear the ballot being read and candidates being identified 
Thankfully , Kaity is doing much better .... the fever yesterday had me worried . 
Just got a WONDERFUL surprise !! \ 
I found some eggs UNDER the damp hide in the snake tank . They were shriveled and I didn't hold much hope , but put them in a small plastic container with vermiculite , which I have dampened at random intervals . 
we made EIGHT batches of fudge this weekend .... plain , with almonds , with walnuts , with pecans , < PROPMALE > road , white chocolate with cashews and two batches of chocolate with reeses ' peanut butter chips stirred in .

it is about 55 degrees ( F ) outside and the sun is shining , so Flash is in the outdoor ' enclosure ' getting \real\ " UV and eating grass like a good little tortoise ! "
