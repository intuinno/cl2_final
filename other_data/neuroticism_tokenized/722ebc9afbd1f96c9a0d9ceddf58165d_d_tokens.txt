True love comes in quietly , w/o banners or flashing lights . he is your sanity in a world full of madness . True love is not how grand you are or how simple you are , but its who you are when you're with hin ... and he loves you not in spite of it , but because of it . he is the one who stands w/ you when the rest of the world falls down ... --- < PROPMALE > wilde fontain
