snow days are the best ... 
1 week left of school ... i hope i can make it 
I really hate those crazy christmas shopper people ... they are just completely CRAZY 
Vacation has finally started .. 
yes ... snow ! 
there is nothing quite like annoying sophmores on your bus ride home ..... 
so while everyone else is at parties this new years ... im home , being bored .

best quote ever ( From Catholic School)-All the daily neck tie tying practice which started in kindergarten ( age 5 ) has been extremely useful . I can tie up an acceptable tie in my sleep , drunk , and with one hand . 
dear weekend ... I missed you and it's very nice to see you again ... 
.... monday's almost here ... 
the religion final I took today was a FAIL

I still dont understand the point of having a RELIGION project ..... I already know that God is good and stuff , what else do I need to kno ??? 
Im really hoping that something happens so that I dont have to go back to school tomorrow .... 
i hope this day will never end so my mind wont bend when the daylight hits my window in the early morning when im all alone but nights already here so I guess sometime Im gonna have to face my fear of the new day but maybe Ill find a way to never stray from this current place or maybe I'll just go to outerspace ... 
im alone above the atmosphere and no one looking up can find me here cause i can close my eyes and disappear ... 
..... somewhere along the line alll the decades align ...

Love it , or leave it , you can't understand\ 
A pretty face , but you do so < PROPFEMALE > on ..... 
You're never gonna get me\ 
I'm like a bullet though a flock of doves 
Back home , off the run\ 
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists\ 
It isn't that much fun , staring down a loaded gun\ 
So I won't stop dying , won't stop lying ( are you there at all ? )\ 
If you want I'll keep on crying ( do you care at all ? )\ 
Did you get what you deserve ? ( are you there at all ? )\ 
Is this what you always want me for ? \

Can you see me clearly ? \ 
Through that veil of black\ 
Can you hear me clearly ? \ 
Far away from that\ 
Can you feel my heartbeat ? \ 
Is it going too fast\ 
Can you understand me ? \ 
From that life i always reached for 
slept over my dear Ninja's house 8DDD

From the earth to the morgue 
Today I found out that my birthday is on National Carrot Day and also < PROPMALE>'s Birthday ..... and yes , I now feel special 
If it looks like Im laughing\ 
Im really just asking to leave 
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems ? \ 
( I'm not okay)\ 
I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means\ 
To be a joke and look , another line without a hook\

I'm not okay I'm not okay I'm not okay\ 
You wear me out
