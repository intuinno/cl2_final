if anyone is friends with < PROPFEMALE > lappin , can you explain to me how the responses that come out of her office - from her and from staff members - surrounding issues related to food trucks in her district are totally devoid of depth , logic , and substance ? is this normal for her ? 
how is < PROPMALE > 1-on1 vs westbrook the Knicks ' need-a-basket play in a tie game with 10 seconds left ? 
Is this high pitched beeping/sustained electronic tone a standard part of jury duty ? It's unbearable .
