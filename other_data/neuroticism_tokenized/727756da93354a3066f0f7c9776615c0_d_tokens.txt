Lonely 
Yesterday was mine & my hubby's 15th wedding aniversary . He surpised me by having 15 long-stemmed roses delivered to the house . WOW i am blessed to have this man as my husband . Not just because of the roses , but more by the little things of everyday life . My favorite are the phone calls , when he is at work he calls just to tell me he loves me . 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > for sending me Angels . I really like it ! http://apps.facebook.com/angels-beeghh/home?tv3=mKvSYGYaFOGSwDWCKSrAhyuGk020ahK8bKs%3D

Repost if you are a Michigan girl . \
