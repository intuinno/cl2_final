Needs to find a new rock band that sings their vocals , is on time , and has some interesting sound from this decade that isn't all too mainstream or pussie . Also , not these bands today with their constant screaming throughout entire songs . Something like ' 90's Incubus but from a band of today . PLEEEEASE !! 
Must do work , but no motivation . Dx
