First day of school . I was so excited . It sucked . I had a little more than 5 minutes to eat my lunch . We have to be to the next class in 3 minutes , and it takes me 4 minutes to get my lock open . Life sucks .

' s passions ... < PROPFIRST > , softball , education , and revolution . Try to get my attention ... I'm a starry-eyed blur with strict blinders , constantly searching for adventure . Let's turn this world upside down , shall we ?

Sorry guys . I'm on an emotional roller coaster . But I was just told to shut up .. so I think I'm just gonna sit . Wish I had a friend that wasn't too busy . He's right , I do need to stop complaining , so I'm gonna look up to God and remember the sun is shining . Thank yoo , < PROPFIRST > . 
can't believe today was my last fast pitch game with < PROPFEMALE > . I can't sleep . Just a < PROPMALE > .. but don't let me blink , I'll be gone to college surrounded by different people . Different friends . Does high school even really count , socially ? If you hardly remember most of them 30 years later , what's the point in being overly wrapped up in it ? Someone knock me out . I need some sleep .... My brain won't stop working :(

I make enough mistakes as it is , without your lies being spread . ~ Struggling ( and I do mean struggling ) to keep God's light in my life in the views of others . ~

God can use you most effectively when you are broken ; you see , that way , the light can shine through the cracks . I pray that God use my pain to heal someone else's .

\People are going to Hell everyday 
What do I do when I see someone EXTREMELY GORGEOUS ? I stare , I smile , and when I get tired ... I put the mirror down ! Hahahahaha 
Have you noticed that the \lol\ " symbol kinda looks like a drowning guy ? I'll bet he's not laughing out loud .... " 
Without\ 
God our week would be : Sinday , Mournday , Tearsday , Wasteday , Thirstday , \ 
Fightday , Shatterday . Seven days without God makes one weak ! 
had sooo much fun with < PROPFIRST > at the zoo yesterday ! That's a shoutout , < PROPFIRST > ! \ 
And has been playing Neopets all day ! Bwahahaha ! 
hey , guys ! You should go to my SocialVibe profile and do some of my activities , please ? You can get there by clicking the \Help now ! \ " button on the badge underneath my friends box on my profile . It's much appreciated ! " 
I just saw a video of GLEE LIVE ; they're on tour ! And they sound EXACTLY like they do on the show , for all you \They're just as edited as any other artist\ " haters ! ^.^ < PROPFEMALE > still soooooooo rocks my socks with her spine-chilling part in Bad Romance .. Haha . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Bott , I have a question ..... WHY DO YOU KNOW what Puke , Acid , Earwax , Mucus , Boogers , Toenails , and Dirt taste like ? 
One of our dogs died ... Can't believe she's gone . Finding her was the most terrifying nightmare ... My heart stopped beating for a moment . My Gypsy is being taken care of now ... R . I . P ... Love you . 
I like nonsense - it wakes up the brain cells . Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living . It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope ... and that enables you to laugh at all of life's realities . - Dr Seuss 
why do humans have to be so spiteful ? Why can't we just love with God's love ? If you really care about someone , you don't get a sick enjoyment out of making them cry until they have no more bodily fluids . 
gave my beautiful car a vigorous , painstakingly detailed bath today . She's so pretty . They say freedom comes at a price ... Mine was exactly $1 . \ 
Slow down , enjoy ... and thank God for the big and small blessings alike . That keeps you on the optimistic side , and before you know it you'll find good in even the bad stuff . 
You know , he's relieved so I'm happy . We had a wonderful conversation as friends . Life is good . I'm officially ok and perfectly healed . 
Bra size translations : A- almost there , B- barely there , C- can't complain , D- dang , DD- double dang , E- enormous , F- fake , G- get a reduction , H- help ! I've fallen and I can't get up ! 
Lord I really need You in my life , I fall every time that You're not in sight . I can't go on without Your love . I don't wanna face this world alone , I don't wanna do this on my own . 
< PROPMALE > got me a new phone ! It had a couple problems too , but he's getting it checked out tomorrow . He's definitely taking care of me ! 
< PROPMALE > bought me a new phone ! How sweet . Thank you so much . I am officially back in business , so I'll get your texts from now on . \ 
Count your many blessings , name them one by one ! 
had a really fun time tonight . Looking forward to more face time with old friends . \ 
and is gonna see < PROPMALE > for longer than usual today . That'll be rather swell as well . \ 
Haha < PROPFIRST>'s rhyming rubbed off on me . :p 
is home from painting the town red with < PROPMALE > . We decided to learn each others ' styles better and turns out we have a ridiculously similar taste in everything from women's clothing to coffeetable decorations . :p 
It's barely past noon and has already been an ... interesting day . Full of suspense . Yeah , that's it ... So , had a car wreck this morning to kick it all off . I'm fine , < PROPMALE>'s truck will be paid for . Then I saw the incredibly intense Resident Evil 4 in 3D , after my nerves were already shot . Haha . 
things are coming together and puzzle pieces are fitting ! Much happier and feeling much more encouraged this go round . Thank you Encounter buddies ... I love you and appreciate your thoughts . So much has been lifted from my shoulders this year . \ 
< PROPMALE > is pretty awesome . :p Asked me out with a color-coordinated balloon bouquet I had to pop in order to acquire the messages . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
GLEE TOMORROW !!! I have a game though . :( I'll have to watch it afterward on Hulu . Mr. Baker , you better not miss it ! We have to squeal about how amazing it was , since London's not here for me to pester ! \ 
Ladies and gentleman , stretch your index and thumb muscles for another Gleektastic season . ^.^ 
2010-2011 Fast Pitch Softball District Champs 3rd year running ! Way to go ladies , and as for us Seniors , congratulations ! ;) 
Did the Race for the Cure 5K with < PROPFEMALE > ! It was really pretty amazing . < PROPFEMALE > and I finished strong at about half an hour . It was difficult toward the end ! \ 
Reminds you of the strong , continuous battle that many men and women face every day . Pray for pink warriors . 
Fun at the Corn Maze last night with the family , fun ahead at the fair with < PROPMALE > ! Yayyy ! :)) Been a great weekend . \ 
Oh , and FINALLY just watched the latest Glee . One of my favorite episodes EVER . Why is it that my favorite quote always has to have a bad word in it , thus condemning it unquotable ? 
I always forget how to add photos . Every time . Haha . 
soooo ..... I'm very blessed . A wonderful mother , fantastic father ( if only , if only there were more time in the world ) , awesome friends , amazing boyfriend , a beautiful car , and a loving God . Why should one complain about the little splinters of life ? 
At the Thousand Foot Krutch concert . < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > , this is a shoutout to you who understand the sweatfest that is TFK ! Missing you guys . 
Cheered on my Rockets football players for the last time tonight . Can't believe I'm a Senior ... not ready . How do I feel ? Tired . Hurting from these bus seats . Ready to be home . Curious to see what God does with my life . 
Got two Winter White Hamsters today ... They're so < PROPFEMALE > ... But one's a jerk . I think I'm going to name them ( both females , even if I replace the one ) after Greek goddesses . \ 
And < PROPFIRST > ... Why me !? Haha . This fear of zombies has gotten out of hand . Haha . I'm truly suffering at this point . 
Finished the birdhouse . \ 
Woohoo ! The Hamhamms are getting along :3 Now , to name the cute little turds ! \ 
Loving Fable 2 ! I got married today ! Haha . Mommy time tomorrow . 
Yayyyyy . Sitting here on the floor , with plenty of my babbling nerd-comrades , committed for another 2 hours to the cold ground and a colossal < PROPMALE > staring , taunting my very soul . What is to come ? Only Trelawney can know . As for me , only time can tell what my near future beholds ! Haha 
We love you Dobby .... \ 
\Dobby doesn't mean to kill . Only maim 
Well ... terrible , terrible sick weekend . Coughing and hurting all over . Even missed basketball . Never even got to work on my color wheel . I'll finish in a couple of days though . Don't really feel like doing anything right now . 
A quote that resonates within me every time I hear it from an amazing band that always gets you thinking :\ 
\There's more to living than being alive . \ " -Anberlin . \ 
I think I totally just saw a fellow < PROPMALE > City Girl Stater at WalMart :) 
Has so many things to do ... And all I WANT to do is take a nap . Of course , there's never enough time for Breezy < PROPMALE > . 
Had a crazy day . The Jostens man refreshed my faith in humanity , he was so nice and helped me figure out how to pay my senior stuff even though my check got stolen . He even gave me a tassle for having a rough day . A stupid boy in my class made fun of me crying ... what a jerkwad . 
My best game , on my Daddy's birthday of my senior year . Happy birthday , Dad . That's all you're getting . :p hahaha . \ 
I'd say that was one fun game . Man , I really like those girls out at South Coffeyville . They're really nice . This night is the climax of my high school basketball career . It feels good to win . Good job girls . 
Now that's what I call a good day . No , great day . You know what ? Great weekend . 
I don't understand how to write on someone's wall on the new Facebook ... 
People are just jerk covered jerks with jerk filling , to quote ( and PG-ify ) London's hilarious quote that cheered me up yesterday . :D 
Life is like a giant game of Sims , but I'm pretty sure my character would have to have an extra health bar ... You'd have to maintain her ' stress ' level too . Haha . 
I mustache you a question , but I'm shaving it for later . 
Facebook is officially worth it . I have found/been found by some pretty amazing people from my past that I would have never otherwise gotten back into touch with . Zuckerburg ... I salute you .

Senior year Basketball Homecoming is coming .... I hope I'm < PROPFEMALE > ! Been waiting for this all my life ! 
So , this day couldn't have gone better . Got to see a lot of my family , was Homecoming < PROPFEMALE > in my beloved sister's dress , and was able to spend a large amount of time with < PROPFIRST > and London . Hoorah . Senior year ... Wow . This is it , you guys . Big day for me ? I think yes . 
Time together is just never quite enough \ 
When you and I are alone , I’ve never felt so at home \ 
What will it take to make or break this hint of love ? \ 
Only time , only time\ 
When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of ? \ 
So tell me darling , do you wish we’d fall in love ? \ 
All the time , all the time . 
\Pity those who underestimate enemies are equivalent to the greed of an Usuki Anubis . \ " Huhhhhhhhhh ? " 
BEST DAY EVERRRR !!!! We won an INCREDIBLE game against Wesleyan ( missing 3 of our starters , mind you ! ) , I had 18 points and we were down .. what , about 10 points in the 3rd ? Came back , went into OVERTIME , and won the game by 6 points ! We played pretty well ! 
I wish to become the unquestionable champion , unlike any gentleman who ever had the pleasure to exist . \

Thou shall instruct me and I shall instruct thee ... \ 
Portable atrocities !! 
Ok , everyone else is doing it ... Like this , and I'll say something about you . :D 
You're as cute as a button \ 
The things you do sure are something \ 
Are you running out of breath \ 
From running through my head all night ? \ 
Is there something in your eye , oh \ 
wait , it's just a sparkle\ 
< PROPFIRST > East 
Ha . They're calling it the ' Snowpocalypse ' . How cute . I'm going to go outside tomorrow . :D It's been 3 days . Yayyyyyyyy . \ 
Oh , and < PROPFIRST > might be coming !!! :3 
Why are ' pants ' plural , when they're just one big article of clothing ? :/ Underwear too ..

learned that birthdays are good for you . Statistics show that the people who have the most , live the longest . :3 \ 
Although , I have to admit , I'm pretty bummed I can't celebrate my Un-Birthday today . :( 
So , I had an epic birthday , full of glorious family dinnerage and laughs to be had . \ 
As for my birthnight , well , I just gotta say we gamers know how to party right and nerdy :D
