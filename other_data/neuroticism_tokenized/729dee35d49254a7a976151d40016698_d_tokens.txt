And I owe Alli my fucking life for being one of the best driver's I've seen . I SERIOUSLY have a new respect for life and the little things that normally don't matter .

Bal'adash - Hello ( Hello there ) 
: Behind the eyes of the predator laid the loving gaze of a companion . In the darkness , she was the light . There was no other explaination for the way I felt when I stared into hazel-amber pools . ( <3 Eye of the White Wolf <3 ) 
: wishes she knew someone that would deliver to Farmingdale NY ! 
: wondering why life is so god damn fucking hard . Fuck this shit . I think I'm done .

: If I'm a bad person , you don't like me ... Oh well . :D <3 
It's a circle , a mean cycle ... I can't excite you anymore . Wheres your gavel , your jury - whats my offense this time ? You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me , then sentence me to another life . I don't wanna hear your sad songs , I don't wanna play your games . So long as I'm not involved ' cause you know we're not the same , we're not the same , oh we're not the same ! 
: Fuck the world andf the scum bags in it . Next asshole to add me and flirt with me is getting ELFUCKINGCABONG'D ... AGAIN ! 
: is offically so fucking pissed at < PROPFIRST > Hayes that she has been crying for the last few hours . Who are you to take the one thing that makes me happy in life and alter it to YOUR liking ? DON'T FUCK WITH MY FUCKING SHAMAN YOU STUPID FUCKING DOUCHE ! I DON'T HAVE THE GOLD TO RESPEC HER ! 
: This sucks . This really really sucks . 
: Apparently I can either sleep , sleep , or sleep ... Since I'm so fucking boring - apparently . 
: Fuck the world and it's need to forget/ignore me . FUCKING BITE ME !

: It's mine and < PROPMALE > Gruber's 1 month anniversary ! <3 4/24/10 <3 Gunna have me my fun todaaay ! 
: Someone wanna help me find a doctor to remove my voicebox ? 
: Sometimes I wonder why I do the things I do when I know I'm not meant to be as happy as I try to make myself . 
: Lying is your favorite passion . Hired heels and lipstick napkins , dying is your latest fashion ! 
: < PROPMALE > Gruber , you're one in a million . Thought I was through , but I ended up stumbling right into the arms of the one I needed , baby , and I love you ! <3 
: <3 Bliss <3 =} 
: KOOL AID ! ( Fruit Punch ) <3 =] 
: Good Morning world ! Or is it so good of a morning ? 
: Anyone going to the beach and wanna take me and < PROPMALE > ? You know you want to . Beach run . =] 
: I'm up , I'm awake , and I'm now about to go tan on the sidewalk - fuck the world I gave up on caring . 
: Apparently I'm not tanning ... :( 
: This is why I don't cheat ! http://www.PayBackKatie.in/?id=8zp8uh0yy8fsbnm03escrb6x44pcug 
: The day < PROPMALE > Gruber forgot about \really good\ " sex .... I'm quoting this Convo mentally and I'm too shocked to even laugh . " 
: Going outside for a smoke . 
: I'm shutting the comp down for an hour , txt < PROPMALE > - my phone is dead . <3

: Shopping <3 
: I love my baby , yes I do ! <3 
: Going to sleep after some < PROPMALE > popcorn munching , or penutbutter sammich munching . Something ... Possibly .. I hope ... 
: Just waking up is the oddest feeling in the world when you're not high . 
: Love is a terrible temptress , a cruel mistress not unlike the harsh seas , with tidal waves of agony that come crashing down on you . 
: finally flew the coop , all ... But at what cost ? I love you < PROPMALE > , don't do anything stupid , please . 
Love is a tough cycle to have to float through . It's almost amazing how everything can just fall apart with one huge revelation ... I know myself well enough to sat I'm a complicated girl - but I hate how it took me this long to realize I should've listened 3 years ago and moved sooner . 
: IF I'M A BAD PERSON , YOU DON'T LIKE ME , WELL I GUESS I'LL MAKE MY OWN WAY . IT'S A CIRCLE , A MEAN CYCLE , I CAN'T EXCITE YOU ANYMORE . WHERE'S YOUR GAVEL , YOUR JURY ? WHAT'S MY OFFENSE THIS TIME ? YOU'RE NOT A JUDGE BUT IF YOU'RE GUNNA JUDGE ME , THEN SENTENCE ME TO ANOTHER LIFE ! I DON'T WANNA HEAR YOUR SAD SONGS , DON'T WANNA PLAY YOUR GAMES , SO LONG AS I'M NOT INVOLVED ' CUZ YOU KNOW WE'RE * NOT THE SAME* !

: Waking up and finding where your BF pased out .... PRICELESS ! 
: Finding boyfirend and having him tell you \Let me finish sleeping\ " fucking sad face man . :( " 
: Whitestone vs Bayside High .... Whitestone won for me . 
: I am who I am , and that is that . Deal with it , or leave me be . It's just that damn easy ! 
: Things aren't the way they were before , you wouldn't even recognize me now ... But in the end it doesn't even matter . 
: \ 
Hated by many - wanted by plenty , disliked by some -confronted by none . C'mon fuckers , I'm waiting . Make your fucking move . You can't touch me in Heaven , nigga , all the way from Hell . 
: Going to < PROPFIRST>'s house , my friends ! You know who to call if I am needed . Love you all , and miss you too ! 
: Mission 1 ) Wake < PROPFIRST > up . Mission 2 ) Get a pack . Mission 3 ) Get my Clothes from the post office . Mission 4 ) Try not to die from heat stroke ! 
: WARHAMMER ! <3 Kammie the dorkball strikes again . Sadly I'm paying attention to the game . LMAO . 
: Yeah , yeah .... < PROPFIRST > just might get me to play him a second time in Warhammer ... Let's see how that works out - I suspect he'll try again by thursday , possibly before tuesday . 
: I NEED A CIGGARETTE !!!!!!!!!!! 1111 NOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW ! 
: Must ...... Find ..... Ciggarette ................ holy shit ..... 
<3 Fuck I need a smoke . <3 
: Need nicotine god fucking damnit . I'm gunna end up bleeding if I keep bugging out and scartching like mad . I feel like a crack head && it makes me wanna cry . :( 
: I'm going to bed , I'm starting to freak out to the point of crying . I wish I had a ciggy . 
: Sidewalks , running away from the streets we knew ... Hope the sun is gone away ... 
: Love how only one person even cares I'm going crazy , ripping myself apart on his floor . Fucking sucks , just to know how few friends I really have , that'll never forget me . 
: GOD FUCKING DAMNIT FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE . 
: Mn I'm so sick and tierd of seeing a million other girls so much prettier than me with better personalities and all that stupid BS everywhere I go - and still having people lie to me , saying I'm better when I'm obviously not . I hate being lied to , I hate being so plain compared to so many others . I wish I was prettier , smarter , funnier . I wish I wasn't me . I wish I was better . 
: I fight for the < PROPMALE > to be lied to again . 
: Red Bucks && < PROPFIRST > Hayes - the two things I need to start my day off right ( and without murdering anyone) !!!!!!!!!!! <3 
: Moving in with friends , the icing to the cake . 
: Hate realizing your old best friend is still hotter than you ? I do . :'( 
: Watching/Listening to < PROPFEMALE > and Grubb is just fucking funny . Man , best day ever . 
: POOL TIME ! 
: Sitting around until we gotta hit G-ma's and grab gas money , then it's off to get applications and then it's party time ! Oh ! We're all moved into our new apartment with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Grubb ! Yay ! Everything is looking perfect right about now ! <3 < PROPFEMALE > Kat Konspiracy & Kameron Hayes ( Konspiracy ) <3 
: Fuck I need an ipod charger ! 
: AFK - going to Walmart ! 
: Must kill stupid shitty interwebs connection ! 
: Oh yeah , I'm no different in Texas than New York and still my life's beyond improved . Guess that proves just how much better this place is . High School bullshit goes out the window and what * really * matters comes into play . The mentality is so much better . Even the \slime balls\ " have more humanity than a \ " good person\ " in New York ! But - I still love all my beautiful friends that I'm missing so dearly . " 
: < PROPFEMALE > fucking sigh .... If only ... If only ... Is it ever going to be a time where I'm wrong ? 
: Nevermind my need to flee ... \False alarm \"?" 
: Facebook ... Oh how I might delete you ! Drama , tension , despair ! Freedom , expression , nothing will ever be attainable outside of my own mind . 
: I must worry too much , or perhaps not enough ? Why did the world have to be so God damn cruel ? 
: It's been a long time coming since I got what I deserved ! The perfect man for me , a best friend that'll last through the ges , and a life worth writing a best selling novel about ! I can't possibly ask for more , or better ! ( Just need to update my photos ASAP !! ) 
: Finally get a fucking dog ....... AND IT RAN AWAY AST NIGHT THANKS TO MY ROOMIES !!!! FUCK THIS SHIT ! 
: Found the dog ... Now all I need are cigarettes and I'll be happy ! 
: I came . I saw . I conquered . 
: Shopping .. Late <3 
: Some of us like to play with fire , but I like to play with ice . It's sharp and cold and kills you slowly and painfully - whereas the shock from being set aflame could kill you instantly . 
: I never realized just how well the Labyrinth Soundtrack really does describe me , my life - and all those other little dorky things ... Sometimes I wonder ... if that movie has some crazy connection to my life ... God I must be going insane ! 
: Yay < PROPFIRST > , coming to rub a party I'm not invited to in my face .... YAY ! 
: I'm so scared of what is to come ! I'm also so stubborn to learn from it . Regardless of the outcomes , I'm just too closed up to accept a god damn thing anyone offers . It's a horrible trait I should fix , but I just can't seem to find the way to let it gooooo . It's pissing me off - despite my trying to ignore it . Damn it . 
: I wouldn't ask me anything if I were anyone but myself . 
: Sigh .. Labyrinth cures all ! 
: Fun times , just fun times ! The day is going to be a good , interesting day and I'm enjoying it to it's fullest . I should remember to let the days be like this more often ! 
: wish i could be WoWing ! 
: FOR ALL OF YOU THAT BLAME ME FOR WHAT < PROPFIRST > HAS DONE , HE AND YOU ARE TOTALLY WRONG ! I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME TRYING MY HARDEST TO RIGHT THE WRONGS , BUT CAN YOU BLAM ME FOR BEING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE THATS RIGHT FOR ME ? 
: And the days go one and on and on and on , and I'm still singing stronger , and stronger , and stronger than before ! 
: Sigh ... There are just some things I'm not looking forward to ... I have a feeling my spiral of depression is just going to get worse ...... 
GAH ! GOD DAMN IT ! I REFUSE TO BE THIS PATHETIC ! JUST FUCK THE WORLD ! FUCK IT WITH A TITANIUM DILDO , DAMN IT ! I miss NY .. My family and my second family ( aka friends ) ... At least you guys were there when I cried even if you hated me ( not all of you , but some do - and they haven't been added to this FB for obvious reasons ) . 
: Damn it ... I need to start remembering to collect < PROPFIRST > when people come over - just in case I need them ... Like now .... FML .... 
: Life's just a crazy little side show full of thieves and betrayers . Nothing you can do but be the big bad lupine amidst the various vulpine of this vast , haunted < PROPMALE > of life . :) Just ironic , if you look at it from that perspective . I seem to be rolling in the odd , ou t-t here thoughts . Tranquility is it's best when there is nothing to interupt the flow of the immagitive flux .

thoughts . Tranquility is it's best when there is nothing to interupt the\ 
flow of the immagitive flux . 
: It's just another day in the undertow of life , but it seems a few air bubbles , or brushes with the surface , allows for a little more air than usual . Eh . ' Spose it's true what they say , if you pay too much attention to life in general you start to go insane . We're not ready for that shit , as humans . 
: I hate feeling like I can't say my peace . Too many people would start freaking out on me if I did . Bottling it up doesn't help , but when life doesn't throw you a blankie , you're stuck fighting off the bad dreams by ignoring them , and that doesn't make them go away . 
: It's looking like those < PROPFEMALE > Slippers might just be coming my way soon . Sometimes I wonder why I even associate with people . 
: People screaming in the middle of sex at 4 AM deserve to have their voice boxes ripped out and their faces fucking mauled off . Seriously . 
: It's a circle , a mean cycle .... 
: I'm sitting all alone , feeling empty . < PROPFEMALE > has never spoken truer words . 
: Apparently I don't even count as someone to talk to . Thanks Grubb . 
: Look at me , the person that doesn't exist apparently . How lovely . I've become the forgotten one again . Wish I could cry , think it'd make me feel better . But who knows ? Doesn't seem to be a cure for being forgotten . 
: I wish I knew how to believe in futures .... 
If you care .. If you REALLY ever cared about me , not just out of pity or self moral , then write something ... ANYTHING on my wall . I don't care WHAT it is , just write something on my wall so I know I'm not alone . So I know I'm wrong .. PLEASE ... I really need everyone to do it if they care . I need to know . 
: An hour goes by - and is anybody in the room with me yet ? No . They're out drinking . Awesome . 
: Thank you < PROPMALE > Lopez for coming through for me when no one else could , or wanted to ! And again thank you < PROPFEMALE > Duh for trying your hardest , too ! 
: Tonight the angels cry , as their savior slowly fades to black and dies , leaving nothing but the cries of the dead and the dying . 
: I have failed again . Seems no one in my part of town has pot right now . Wooo ! I can't medicate my bi polar ! This shit SUCKS ! 
: Good night cruel world . 
: Her feelings she hides . Her dreams she can't find . She's losing her mind . She's fallen behind . She can't find her place . She's losing her faith . She's falling from grace . She's all over the place ! ( In a nutshell ... In a nutshell ... I should have never forgotten this would always be my theme song . * Sigh *) 
: Her feelings she hides . Her dreams she can't find . She's losing her mind . She's fallen behind . She can't find her place . She's losing her faith . She's falling from grace . She's all over the place ! ( I just wish the world could understand just how true it is ) 
: She wants to go home but nobody's home , that's where she lies , broken inside . Her feelings she hides . \ 
Her dreams she can't find . She's losing her mind . She's fallen behind . \ 
She can't find her place . She's losing her faith . She's falling from \ 
grace . She's all over the place ! She's lost inside , lost inside . 
: I hate mornings . 
: I'm almost giving up the hunt . I want to sleep but I can't . Here comes another amazingly horrible day . Great . Everyone else is laughing and I'm in a corner , sad - and you think anyone noticed ? Nah , too busy watching T.V. to care . 
: There's no place like home . 
: Song of the night ? TIK TOK ! 
: Scratch that . Song of the night is \Nobody's Home\ " ... AGAIN . < PROPMALE > life . " 
: Tik Tok rockin ' in the background of my headset - just waiting for the smoothie to melt so I can drink it . Thanks to my first cup bei9ng devoured I won't get crunked . Dunno why I even accepted the drink since it won't make it any different . 
: I should stop listening to \my genre\ " of music . It apparently seems bad for me . Damn \ " Ghetto\ " music and people being right . Fuck My Life . Why ? LMAO . I can't wait to see the faces of the people who see me in NY whenever I come back ! " 
: I got a few rules for the common folk here , I'm not cool with the way I was once treated in NY . If you call yourself my friend then you'll at least text me once a day & chill close enough to everyday . If you dare partake in my generosity than you better show appreciation in any way possible . And lastly , for now , if you say you're a friend you better understand backstabbing me is a DEATHWISH . 
: I suggest if you hate Ke$ha ... Not to call me , lol , or you'll want to commit suicide ! 
: Love my life , hate the people in it . Hopefully I'll be out of this hellish place soon . 
: Man , this is so boring ! 
: WOOOOO HOOOOO life's getting better !!!! 
: Just a few more days and I'll be coming home ! WOOT ! 
: Misery is a constant , apparently . 
: Man , these Drama Queens need to stop flocking to me before I knock a few \bitches\ " back into place . Never thought some could get so under my skin . " 
: <3 PAAAAARTYYYY TOMORROW !!!! Tonight I'm kicking back and relaxing - no need to bother with running around on a Monday ! If you need me , my Cell is on so just drop me line - my number is the same as always . :) Much <3 to all my friends - and more <3 to my family ! LOVE YOU < PROPFIRST > && < PROPMALE > && < PROPMALE > && Big D !! 
: Workin ' and stuffs . I'll give the peeps a call later when it's party time ! 
FUCK the world ... FUCK life ... FUCK THE PEOPLE IN IT ( except my lovelies , you know who you are - < PROPFEMALE > Spirio and my mother included) ! I'm done with the BS and games . Shit is gunna get serious fast ! 
: People ... Oi ... 
: I HATE LIJ and their need to keep me on hold for OVER AN HOUR !!!!!!!!!!! Just to change a fricken appointment !!! Man , this might be easy work , but it's annoying as HELL ! 
: Not going to let life get me down . No , no . Not a < PROPMALE > in hell ! 
: Laptop charger came in ! Hello , WoW , here I come ! 
: Hating on Mc < PROPFIRST>'s stupid application program ! Stupid \Continue\ " button doesn't want to work and I don't feel like re-entering everything I just did . Ugh ... Yay for work applications ! ( BLAAAAAH ! ) " 
: Smoke break , Kittens for two hours , then REAL work .... Which is probably going to be more kittens . Ha ha ha ! Can't wait for < PROPFEMALE>'s adoption to go through !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I get to play mommy when it does ! Wooot ! I'm actually excited (?) ! Never thought I would be - guess it's because I didn't have to pop it outta my ... Well ... Yeeeah - LATER ALL ! <3 
: I feel so alone ... 
: This is starting to make me wonder if I even deserve to live anymore . This is just spiraling again and again no matter what I do . I do no wrong and still it proceeds to go down and down and at this point there is no saving me or anything I've done , or will do - it's just not worth shit . 
: Woooo ! Orientation at 1:00 PM .! I'm soooo happy to get this done and over with ! < PROPFEMALE>'s is going to be a fun job , I can tell already ! 
: Woooo hooo ! I'm so happy orientation went so well . It's a total burden off my shoulders ! Now is the wait . :( I'll have to make phone calls come tuesday if I don't hear by monday ( kinda hope they call tomorrow ! ) 
: Man today went quick but I missed a shift I could've picked up . Alas , no work this week so far but the next open shift there is I'm gunna try and grab it . See you all around - I'm about to go break in the CYCLONE and see what colors it'll really turn ! So far my baby is SILVER and blue on YELLOW ! 
: Love slow , lazy days . Hate being a girl , though . Dreaded G-visits if ya know what I mean ! 
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show . Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor . ( Ke$ha - Take It Off <3 ) 
: Hot and Dangerous ... I'm running this town like a club . <3 
: Need someone with a car for a pick up <3 I hate being carless and sick - and without reliable friends . 
: Actually , fuck this shit . I'm going to walk . Ke$ha , We R Who We R , is the song of the day . Feel it , yo . 
: If it wasn't for you , all my wishes and dreams could never come true . They say the heart knows better than the mind , but what if you're the only thing I think of , the only reason my heart beats and the reason it beats for ? I could really use a wish right now , so I can wish us into a happy future , eternal . <3 
: I hate how a good mood can be so easily ruined by a few girls and some stupid comments . You know ... I could REALLY use a wish right now ... Fix the problem ahead of time . Maybe if I made the right choice the first time this wouldn't happen ... 
: You won't cry for my absence now , you forgot me long ago . Isn't something missing ? Isn't someone missing me ? Though I died to know you loved me , I'm all alone . Isn't someone missing me ? ( Please stop the pain , you won't stop the pain , you won't say the words ) Please forgive me , but I won't be home again . 
: If I am such a nice , beautiful person then why is it that life only likes me when I'm depressed and crying every last ounce of what's left of me out ? I don't deserve this , do I ? 
: I can scream these lyrics all I want and it still does nothing for me . This is so stupid . 
: Seeing old friends who bring back good memories is the best cure for a terrible week ( in my case few months - dumb life ) . 
: Sigh .... 
: Watching the < PROPMALE > scene in Titanic ... Man , how beautiful it is . I wish , so terribly , that I had something that romantic happen to me ! Sigh . I at least have a boyfriend that won't die at the end of my movie . xD 
: As soon as I find out who answered yes to a bunch of questions that should have been answered no - I am going to fucking burn their house down and eat their families in front of them before I give them a good old Arabian torture ... It takes a few weeks to finish , but when I am done with them I am sure no one is ever going to bother being stupid towards me again . 
: Wish there was a day I didn't have to cry ... 
: Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now , because I just can't do this for a minute longer . I can't seem to do good enough despite doing my best & that isn't enough , but I honestly don't see where making me cry and feel like nothing is going to get me anywhere other than at the very bottom of my hole ? Seriously . What is people's fucking problems ? 
So < PROPMALE > is going back to Tevas to re-enlist , leaving me alone in New York with nothing to live for . GO PARENTS ! It's all their fault . As for < PROPFIRST > Hayes , he is a two faced lying sack of shit and I'm just totally done . Sorry all , I'm going back to my hole . 
: Next weds is the day I'm slowly dying inside .. < PROPMALE>'s going back to Colorado as far as I heard . Why does it always happen to me ? 
: is watching GREAT TEACHER ONIZUKA . You should , as well ! 
: Is singing the ending theme for GTO ( yes in Japaneese) ! I wish it was fucking five already ! 
I might finish the season if I keep watching these . 
: Hopes a shower will wake her up . Also hopes her < PROPFEMALE > will get up soon so she can shower and leave before 6:30 . Can't wait to hear the bitch fit I'll get when the BF finds out I ran off to cool my jets . All this dreadful thinking is really making me second guess everything I have ever known . I'm terrified . 
I want to say thank you to the people that stuck by me through thick and thin . It's a huge burden off my shoulders to know I have a good support system to fall back on in times of need . I can't be everyone's fall back girl all the time . \ 
\ 
I'm missing all my old friends from back in the day . We should all chill again . I still got the same number , if you don't have it message me on FB ! 
When the dark of the night comes around that's the time that the animal comes alive looking for something wild ... There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around it's a hole in the wall it's a dirty free-for-all ! There's a place I know if you're looking for a show , where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor ! \ 
-EVERYBODY TAKE IT OFF ! - 
: Says , \Snow needs to die . Let's invent a giant blow dryer and melt the snow ...... Or maybe shoot ' GOD ' in the face so it never snows again\ " . End useless status ! " 
: Missing you ... You're sweet kisses , intoxicating , leave me craving more . 
: Ain't got a care in world , but got plenty of beer/Ain't got no money in my pocket , but I'm already here/Now , the dudes are lining up ' cause they hear we got swagger/But we kick ' em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger 
: GOD DAMN IT GET OUT OF MY FUCKING HEAD ! SHIT IS STUPID ! I CAN'T STOP THINKING !!!!!!!!!!!! 
: GAAAAAH FUCKING , I HATE THIS ! What am I supposed to dooo ? 
: God , people , WAKE UP !!!!!!! 
: Yawn . Tired . Going to sleep for now . < PROPFEMALE > CALL ME WHEN YOU GET OUT/WAKE UP/GET HOME ! < PROPFIRST > ... You're mean and you should call me when you decide you want to get a damn coffee , ' cause I owe you one and I've been trying to treat you all day ! DUMBASS ! 
<3 My heart is pounding , a mix of fear and joy . A month ago I thought I was gone , just a flat-line , but you're brought me back from the brink of death just by being back in my life . 
... FML ... I'm in love and I can't stop it . I won't let him get away I'm not losing him again . I waited five long fucking years to get a < PROPMALE > and I won't fuck it up . I've had this void in my heart this entire time and I can't live this way . I -will- have him back and I -will- show him he has another choice , another way to live . I won't stop fighting until I can say , \I am dating < PROPFIRST > Manco\ " . I . WON'T . GIVE . UP ! " 
: Just fucking speechless . Just wanna hit fast forward and get to the happy ending already . LOL . 
: I can't sit here and fucking just not go crazy this is impossible . 
: >.< I fell like fucking < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Swan . This shit is CRAZY . I can't even begin to fucking explain . 
xD God . Going .. Crazy ... 
: I can't stand it . I want him to call me right now . I just can't stand this , I can't take not seeing him right now . I know in time when I can call him mine it won't be like this , it won't hurt so bad not to see him , but now with my fear he'll slip away it's painful not to be next to him - so I know he's still focused on me . 
: WANT TO BUY , SIMPLE LIFE WITH LESS DRAMA ! 
: Man when is this shit gunna end ? LMAO . 
I'M IN LOVE ! And it feels like heaven ! I can't even explain what's going on or how awesome I feel ! 
: <3 You're face , like a song , is stuck on repeat in my head . You're kisses , like < PROPFIRST > Daniels , intoxicates me in a way I've never been before . I stumble through life as it speeds by , my body slowed down my the loss of blood and oxygen to my brain , because baby when I'm around you .. It's just like being drunk and bled dry by a vampire . Scary , exciting , and making me dizzy ! ( I r Dork xD ) 
o.o I can not believe I am about to do this ... In the next five minutes everyone will either love me , or block me . LOL . 
: Sigh . I miss you !

Going crazy , bored as all hell - sucks to wake up with no one in the house .

I want to slap guys that take five times as long as girls do to get ready . 12:30 to 2:07 and still no response is a very scary long time for a guy to get ready and eat . O.o Or maybe I'm just super woman ??

I Don't Want My Boyfriend To\ 
- break his xbox for me ;\ 
- stop talking to the rest of the female population ;\ 
- or blow off his friends for me . \ 
What I Do Want Him To Do Is\ 
- teach me how to play Black Opps ;\ 
- remember that he has a girlfriend ;\ 
- and invite me to < PROPFEMALE > with his friends . \ 
Because That's What A Good Boyfriend Would Do . 
If it isn't my dad , it has to be my mother . If it isn't my parents it has to be the people that SUPPOSEDLY called me friend , family . Can I get a fucking break from the heartache , please ?
