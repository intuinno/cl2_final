Does anybody need any goats ? I am searching for good goat-loving families to adopt my herd of 6 goats :) I need to find homes for all of them . I have an adult female , a young female & a young male . I also have < PROPFIRST > , Sugarbutt & < PROPFIRST > , but would like those three to stay together though . Message me if you are interested . 
<3 True love from both people has to be put above all else in a relationship . No more , no less . Or there is no relationship .

FAVORITE QUOTE OF THE DAY ( thanks Lynn ! ) ~ Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car . 
Found me a rock at < PROPFEMALE > today ! HEAVEN !!!!!

Hit the lake today :) Not the same as my rock at < PROPFEMALE > , but still beautiful ! 
* FOUND * Two small - medium dogs without tags running back and forth across the road in the traffic at the bridge construction in front of the LC bus garage . They look like some kind of terrier mix . One is a cream colored male and one is black . Very friendly . I am sure they belong to someone . If anyone knows where they might live , please let me know so I can get them to their homes .

Bright sun , and not too humid .... aaahhhhh <3 
** < PROPFEMALE > WARNING : Just a friendly note : I believe in the right of everyone to have their own opinion in politics as well as anything else . I am not , nor ever will be PRO-SARAH :) I am sorry , I just do not agree with almost everything she says . I respect others right to be pro-Sarah , and would not dislike someone just because of their political opinion . So please , respect my opinion as well :) HAVE A GREAT DAY :) 
Oh my ... 
and now the allergies want to set in ... yay :( 
People that support different comprehensive doctrines can agree on a single political organization . This is achieved by avoiding the very deepest of arguments for certain religions or philosophies and focusing basically on justice . This would be the best way to agree on human rights and keep the notion of Democracy . ~ < PROPFIRST > Rawls 
\ A life filled with indifference 
My BABY is a SOPHMORE !!! Where has all of the time gone ?!?!? She is such a GREAT kid , and I am sooo proud of her <3 
Well , I guess the first day was a success <3 
American people , stand by the nation's belief in religious tolerance . America must remember the country's enemy is not Islam , it's al-Qaida . Americans cannot turn on each other and let their fears lead to division . The American people are one nation under God . And we might call that God different names , but we remain one nation . There are Muslims serving in the armed forces , They are Americans . We honor their service . ~ Obama 
Nothin better than a fall ride . The view from the bike , listening to the hum , with the wind blowin around you , feeling the change in temperatures on your skin , and all of the fragrances that Mother Earth has to offer .. Except ... maybe ... < PROPFEMALE > :) It's a close one <3

Asked whether the thought of Palin's running for office scares her , Oprah said : \

All I can say is .... wow , and that is not in a good way 
Dear Lord , Today as I embark on my journey , PLEASE < PROPMALE > me the Serenity .....

I just came across an older genltleman who was in need of asssistance . I found out after , he is a priest and was calling a Catholic Church . I think that was my sign :)

Today was the first day of clinicals with the high school girls . My group ALL did amazing and I am SO proud of them !!!! The Residents are very lucky to have you wonderful girls <3 
Good Morning to my hard working ladies :) You did great yesterday , and today is gonna be even better ! Second day of clinicals , here we come !!! :)

HAPPY ST . PATRICK'S DAY ! 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3 kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when standing . A woman read this entire post ... a man is still looking at his thumb . Repost this if it made you smile .

When the power of love overcomes the love of power , the world will know peace . \ 
Jimi Hendrix ? 
Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness , and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness . You could complain because a < PROPFEMALE > has thorns , or rejoice because the thorns have a < PROPFEMALE > , depending on your personal attitude . 
“Nothing happens by < PROPMALE > , my friend ... No such thing as luck . A meaning behind every little thing , and such a meaning behind this . Part for you , part for me , we may not see it all real clear right now , but we will , before long . ”\

~ The Power of Submission\ 
lies not in the ability\ 
to give over ones body\ 
or to kneel before another\ 
The Power of Submission\ 
can be found only in the heart\ 
of one who gives her love\ 
to another freely\ 
knowing what joy and pain\ 
will come from it ~

Along with my words of wisdom today , I have just this to say ....... SNOWSHOE IN 3 hours , 4 minutes !!!!!!!!! <3 
** Snowshoe countdown WAS 16 minutes . BUT , anyone that knows me .... Snowshoe countdown ( recalculated because of my punctuality issues ) 1 hour and 16 minutes !!!! LMAO I <3 U Pete-Honey :) 
AND BLAST OFF !!!! Snowshoe , here I come ! Ready for some relaxation , good company , beauty , and peace <3 .... Thought to leave you with ~ What is a TRUE friend ? someone that likes you for who you are , someone that cares about your feelings , someone that you can confide in that doesn't judge , disagree with and then make up with . AND Definitly NOT someone who thinks it's funny when you are sad :( 
You have been my friend . That in itself is a tremendous thing . I wove my webs for you because I liked you . After all , what's a life , anyway ? We're born , we live a little while , we die . A spider's life can't help being something of a mess , with all this trapping and eating flies . By helping you , perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle . Heaven knows anyone's life can stand a little of that . \

Though friendship is not quick to burn , \ 
It is explosive stuff . \
