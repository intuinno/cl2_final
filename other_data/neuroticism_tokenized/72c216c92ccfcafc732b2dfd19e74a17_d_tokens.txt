Sorry for all the random posts !!! For those of you that are starting to , or are going to , get annoyed with them , just block the app . Thankies !!! ^_^ 
Soooooo , the federal aid people said the school had access to my FAFSA in September . The financial aid people have no clue . Someone please give me my money so I can continue my schooling !!!! 
I've decided that , as much as I love games , Southwestern needs to stop playing hide-and-seek with my FAFSA ... 
found a Schlotzsky's down the road from SU !!! Now she just needs an apartment . 
is looking at three places ... Hopefully she'll get a positive response from one tomorrow . 
still hasn't heard back from any of the apartments she was looking at .... lalala .... Time to go look for some more ! 
The tent just blew away . Kind of sort of fortunately the truck and the car stopped it . :-( The ranger's got a dent and the car has a scratch . But on a good note , < PROPFIRST > got his refund check today ! And his paycheck is supposed to go through tonight too !!!!! 
People keep backing out of agreements . Don't say you can if you can't . And < PROPFIRST > got a paper check instead because the direct deposit isn't set up yet so we don't have that money . AND there's a 5-day hold on the refund check , so we're not getting that money until December 7th . AAAAHH !!!!!! Oh , and my car DID get dented ....... FML . 
We made $139 at the yard sale and then spent $130 on groceries . Hahaha . That didn't last long . 
is trying to decide if her rat would be better off staying in < PROPMALE > or moving to Texas ... We don't want to get rid of her , but we don't want her to have a heart attack on the drive down to Texas ... Opinions , anyone ??? Please ? 
I see how it is - everyone has to comment on the < PROPFEMALE > retriever post , but no one will help me determine the fate of a living creature . Mmmmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmm ... lol But seriously , guys , I could use some advice on what to do in this situation . :-P 
feels icky and needs a place to stay come January ... Yikes . I can't even find temp housing . I officially fail . 
is keeping her fingers crossed . ****** 
is thankful that her family taught her how to properly wash dishes . 
So it's a no on the first place , but hopefully one of the other two will work out or it's back to square one . Again ! Once again keeping the fingers crossed on two places that are looking pretty good for us right now . 
is creating her spring semester schedule . wOOt !!!! 
Back down to 283 friends and blocked Castle Age . Now hopefully I won't have 50-some odd requests every 5 minutes ! Also decided that Chaucer was a no-go since the rest of my classes are M/W/F and it was the only one on T/TH . Now hopefully they'll keep it that way so I have two more days available for work ! 
is wondering which language she should take for her required foreign language ... Chinese , French , < PROPMALE > , Spanish , Greek , or continue in Latin ??? Oh , the possibilities . 
nom nom nom < PROPFEMALE > pie 
cut her thumb buying ketchup , sour cherries , and a < PROPFEMALE > pie . But the < PROPFEMALE > pie's deliciousness made up for it . The band-aid is in an awkward place , though . 
is wondering how much of her stuff she can fit in her car ..... It's big for a car , but it's so < PROPFEMALE > compared to what needs to go in it . 
is taking The Deaf One outside . 
Anybody want a round-faced male grey tabby cat ??? 
is spending way too much on books for class ... Already . It's not that they're expensive , it's just that I'd prefer to use that money for food on the way to Texas . 
I hate it when people say that they are coming to pick something up , and then never show up . She hopes I understand . Ya know , I would understand if she had called me BEFORE she was supposed to pick up mine . Yes , inform me of it 3 days later and expect me to be okay with the fact that you didn't let me know after YOU scheduled a pick-up time with me and wasted MY time and now I'm out my money , too . SHEESH !!!!! 
Time to go to sleep . We have to get up at an ungodly hour to make it to the Christmas party tomorrow !!! See everyone there !

The guy in the room next to ours is smoking pot and all I can hear is coughing and rap music , and all I can smell is dog poo and skunk , which is apparently what crappy weed smells like ... Gross . It was like this yesterday , too . >_< 
Just saw an ad that reminded me that I'm going to have to make a list of celebrities I want to meet ( like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , who was in said advertisement ) , and those celebrities I wanted to meet that have now died ... like < PROPFEMALE > Murphy , < PROPMALE > Ledger , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ...... 
my fingers are frozen ... inside my room ... MUST FIND GLOVES !!!! 
can't find her gloves and is sad because the room is freezing , and it stinks in here because everything everyone smokes somehow wafts into the room , making for a combined smell of nastiness ...... My poor little nose ............... 
white 
mofongo 
people are a-holes . Anyone want a dog ? 
I hate to complain about these people day-in and day -out because some of them are nice , but a certain person just walked into our room ( of which the door was closed ) , shut the door in our faces when we tried to say hi , and then proceeded to piss on our stuff . Needless to say - I AM NOT F UCKING HAPPY AND I DO NOT CARE IF I CUSS BECAUSE THIS SITUATION CALLS FOR IT !!! 
Only 1 class tomorrow , but I've got to meet with my advisor , too . 
My dog just ate through the plastic tray in the bottom of her new crate ... And then proceeded to rip up the carpet underneath the crate via the hole she just made ... And then she got tired of that , too , so she decided to pull the towels that were outside of her crate into the crate and chew giant holes in them too . So when I get back home , no towels , and she's covered in blood from eating her kennel ... Oi . 
AES & Calculus today . < PROPFIRST > made his first sale yesterday , and gets commission . My refund check will be available for pick-up on Friday after 2 pm , and I just requested it yesterday . The stupid one's eviction will be final today at 5 pm . Life is good right now , let's keep it up , eh ? :-D 
If I have to go to court just to get my stinking $100 from you , you'll be sorry and paying the legal fees , too . Show some respect and reimburse us for the property you damaged . WE didn't evict you . YOU signed the lease that said drunken and disrespectful behavior is not tolerated and if you engage in such behavior , you WILL be evicted . It's your own fault ; you're 40 ; you're grown ; now give me my money . 
I had lunch with a football player in line at the bank because I'm AWESOME !

Well , the guy sold the car we told him we were going to buy . Oi . Time to find another one , preferably not a < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > with a cracked windshield and broken side mirrors ... :-P 
Argh , if your vehicle has a broken windshield it IS NOT in great condition ........... AAAAAHHHHHHH !!!!!!

doesn't want to do her homework , but knows she has to because it's Sunday . * grrrr * 
went to Goodwill . Not going back . Want to know why ? They locked us into their parking lot for the night ... We had to call the cops to let us out . My opinion ? Fire the guy/gal who locked us in . 
Ha ! The evil papers are complete . Hopefully my teachers like them . Then it's on to the not-so-evil paper for AES that's due tomorrow . 
is wondering why her friends list keeps increasing when she isn't adding any more people ..... weirdness .

Joust with care . Too funny . ^_^ 
Officially hates group projects . Why do teachers do this ? To make less work for them to grade ? Or maybe for their own sadistic pleasure in torturing students ? And why does facebook not want me to ask this question ??? 
needs some candles or something because this air freshener isn't doing shiznitz . 
Snow ??? In Texas ??? And it's sticking enough to cancel classes ??? What twilight zone have I arrived in ???

It turns out Western DID have my transcript , but just didn't know it belonged to me . Got that settled and two days later they accept me . We could've had all this taken care of months ago ... But yay anyway . :-D 
I'm missing another transcript . Apparently Western doesn't have my final high school transcript ! Who'd have thunk it ? You'd figure they would've mentioned that to me the first time I attended ! Haha . 
Apparently facebook doesn't like it when I add my friends . I thought that's what I was supposed to be doing on facebook . Stupid Face ... Book ... Ino-Pig .

My grandmother's advice for the day :\

Happy Halloween !

* Disclaimer - pumpkin is not mine , I just thought it was awesome and needed something Halloween-y for a picture . 
True friends don't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what name brand you wear , if your house is a mess , where you live , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go periods of time without speaking but never question the friendship . Re-post this if you have at least one true friend , they will know who they are ! I have several . I am blessed ! 
It's really hard to convince myself to keep going when this stinkin ' workload is overwhelming ! School is currently a dislike for me . :-/ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and I are eating the free hotdogs our super-amazingly-awesome RA < PROPFEMALE > Rodgers Burch gave us ! Thank you ! 
PAJAMA JEANS !!!! They look weird . lol

Te migraine .... It does not elude me .... But I wish it would ... Ouchies . 
Sleeps , and then starting the pork stuffs in the AM so we can have it for lunch .

taking a brief break from homework ........ 
DOODLEFACE ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Wright was a douche .

Naptime until < PROPFIRST > gets out of his meeting , and then back to work . 
Blah de blah de blah de blah ......... 
Finished cleaning paint off my table , now on to chopping up more magazines since people left me with crap and threw away good pieces in class today . Go figure all my pieces got taken because I actually cut out pieces of the color , and NOT WORDS OR OBJECTS !!!!!!! I don't want your shitty pieces - YOU take them ! 
has vampire bugs in her room - they're nowhere to be seen during the day , one bit my neck last night , and , according to everyone I've seen today , I've been really pale all day long . It must've drunk my blood . lmao 
Also , my knee still hurts ... dang it ... >_< 
Sometimes I hate my life . This is one of those times ... >_<

Our new girls find out their bigs tonight ! Yay ! ^_^ 
??? Me , I want a hula-hoop ! ??? 
Homework headache ... taking a break from reclaimed brick and wall tile ....... On another note , my mom's status just made my day that much brighter . Hahahaha . 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone)\ 
who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in \ 
case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy \ 
and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . The \ 
other 7% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire \ 
extinguishers .... 
So , apparently I absolutely MUST read < PROPFIRST > the Owl . 
Gaining new sisters today ! Yay ! <3 AGD 
Anyone want to go to the gym with me tomorrow ? 
CONGRATULATIONS TO MY NEW < PROPFEMALE > GAM GIRLS !!! 
Does anyone know anything about cars or know anyone who does and would be willing to take a look at my < PROPFIRST > ? We know the battery is dead , but there is a possibility that there is something wrong with the head gasket or engine . I'd rather know before I go buy a new battery and she still won't work or before I scrap her . Any help would be great since I can't afford to tow her to the mechanic . 
Background of collage 1 = COMPLETE\ 
Wall materials for tomorrow's project = LOST\ 
Guess who has to get up early to clean the room and find them tomorrow ? This gal . :-P 
I hate group projects . Also , I hate my group . BAH ! 
Yup , yup , today officially sucks . The straw that broke the camel's back - I'm trying to clean glue off my scissors and I slice a hole right through my washcloth AND my finger . :-/ grrrrrrrrrr ... 
OOOH , my group is gonna be so mad at me !!! But hey , it's not like they asked me before they scheduled the meeting . This is the second meeting I found about AFTER the rest of my group decided on it privately . I'm not prancing my butt down to the library when it's pitch black outside just because THEY scheduled it this late . I sent them the info - they can just shut up and deal with it . 
Waiting impatiently for the hubby to get off work ........ Twiddle < PROPFIRST > , Tweedle Dum , Twiddle Twiddle Tweedle .... Thumbs ??? 
Does anyone know how to drive a < PROPMALE > car and would be willing to help me learn ? 
I find it funny that so many people think I look so cute in a t-shirt and sweat pants ... I don't get nearly as many compliments on my other outfits . :-P 
is out of Pop-Tarts ... sadface ..... 
so sleepy , sleepy , sleepy ............. zzzzzzzzzzz .................... 
I officially hate trying to find specs on products ... Most of the ones I want to use , I can't , just because their manufacturers don't list fire-ratings or other such stuff ... They keep just giving me size information .................................. BAH ! 
Psych is back with new episodes on Wednesday November 10 at 10/9C ! Watch full episodes online at psych.usanetwork.com Userlink Url

Just found out my $ 7,000 hospital < PROPMALE > is paid in full because they realized I have no money . woot ^_^ 
< PROPMALE > Final = 5 ..... Now what to do with it ? Cinco de Mayo , the five elements , the five senses , the five Buddhas , the < PROPMALE > Five , the five Olympic rings ... I'm at a loss . Any ideas ? 
Off to the library to print out a packet I just found about symbolism of the number five . It's cold outside - I wish I knew where my connector cord is ... And then off to pick up < PROPFIRST > from class and return this jar of paste to FPAC since I've been to FPAC twice today and forgotten it both times . >_< doh\ 
BACK LATER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Umm , yeah . You don't have to be as excited about it as I am - hahaha . :-P

Facebook games are being slow today . Also , I definitely didn't know Western had a Quidditch team until yesterday ... That was interesting . 
So I'm thinking about working off of the Khamsa/Chamsa/Hamsa and the < PROPMALE > Khamsa for my project . ^_^ 
? Linger - The Cranberries ? 
is making a playlist on YouTube . ^_^ 
? FNT - Semisonic ? Now I want to watch 10 Things - hahaha . 
My oven is too hot , but at least it's thorough . My brownies aren't supposed to be done for another 15 minutes and they're already burning - but they're burning around all sides instead of just on one side like my old oven . Haha . 
hates that there are stupid people outside whom are singing very loudly and very poorly ....... May I throw rocks at them ? 
is proud of PMA's OE Chapter ! You guys did very well at your AMR . ^_^ 
hates having to alter plans to accommodate other people just to find out it was unnecessary in the first place . >_< 
really needs to go to Wal-Mart before the pharmacy closes . Anyone want to give me a ride , please and thanks ? 
? Head under water and they tell me to breathe easy for a while . The breathing gets harder ; even I know that . ? 
A CatTran is a vehicle that runs twice as fast when you are after it as when you are in it . 
One collage down , one to go . Phew .... 
Homework tonight brought to you by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - Thanks for buying me those glue sticks , my dear , and also thank you for being patient with me while I was being persnickety about my work . And now I shall follow your example and head to bed - hahaha . 
Anyone know Arabic ? lol - I could use some help with an < PROPMALE > project . 
needs a sweater shaver , but can't get out of Cullowhee to go buy one . :-/ 
Finally figured out why her room is the only one in the dorm that smells of stale and nasty blah ...... It's because we're the ones beside the stupid laundry room , which oddly enough doesn't smell like fresh clean laundry ... I hate this place . >_< 
Happy Turkey Day ! \ 
He who thanks but with the lips\ 
Thanks but in part ;\ 
The full , the true Thanksgiving\ 
Comes from the heart . \

Time for a much needed break , albeit not much of my paper is done . 
really wishes the library were open 24/7 during the regular semester , too , not just during exams . 
wishes < PROPFIRST > had the early shift today so he could walk down to the village with me . 
From\ 
now until December 7th change your profile picture to one of a CARTOON\ 
CHARACTER FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD and invite your friends to do the same . The\ 
objective of this is not to see any human face on Facebook , but an invasion of\ 
memories for the fight against Violence to Children . 
Medicine's supposed to make you better , not worse , right ? Man I feel like crap . >_< 
Why does it have to pour rain on the day I need to walk from the top of the hill , down to the village , and back ?????????? 
Laundry and drafting for the rest of the day ... Ooh , fun . >_< 
LAST WEEK OF CLASSES ! LAST WEEK OF CLASSES ! LAST WEEK OF CLASSES ! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! 
All-nighter brought to you by Pepsi . Now I'm sick from the sugar , and I still didn't get my work finished ! BAH ! 
So I accidentally clicked the wrong button and now my profile is stupid . Grrrrrr . Is there a way to go back to the old format ? 
Completely tired of being completely broke ... Can't afford to fix the car , get needed clothes for next semester , or buy Christmas gifts , much less change my name . Oy vey . Screw it all for now . I'll figure it out after exams . 
Sophia : Can I have a bite of your cheesecake ? \ 
Her Mom : No , stop asking . I gave you life , now leave me alone . 
So , set the alarm for 8 ... Woke up at 12:35 right as my 2nd ( last ) class of the day was starting ... Apparently set it for 8 PM instead of AM ... fml , I really needed to get pictures of my work taken for my portfolio during my first class ! 
Hey guys ! I can't check my facebook messages right now , so please if you need to send me something , email me ! K thanks ! @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Adams 
Had a really stupid moment that got her a 0 on a project . I accidentally submitted the instructions for the assignment instead of the work I'd done because they were titled the same ( via instruction of my professor ) ... Just hoping she will take my work now since she didn't mention it to me then ... This is why I hate online crap . If I turn it in in person , it's bound to be the right darn thing !!!!!!! 
dizzy from temp change , and in pain from the cold :( 
Free make-up = bad !!! lmao\ 
If I sent you a post , please don't click it . K thanks !

Okay , day is better - I kept hearing these horrible crunching/grinding sounds , so I looked outside and there's a crap-ton of snow !!!!! No presents today , but at least there's snow and you bet your bottom I'm going outside to play since no one else is on campus ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody ! 
Played in the snow on the way to a friend's house yesterday , then made/ate Christmas ramen , watched a cartoon movie and some kung-fu movies , tried to sleep while the guys killed alien-thingys with chainsaws , and today we played in the snow on the way back home , and got stuck in a pile knee-deep ! Overall , fun weekend . 
Day after Christmas : playing in snow , hanging out with the same friend except at our house , stroganoff , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > marathon , and who knows what's next ! :-P

True commitment begins when we reach the point of not knowing how we can possibly go on ... and decide to do it anyway . 
got to spend the day with < PROPFEMALE > Cifuentes and had so much fun ! ^_^

I bowed my head and I prayed real hard\

Today was great ! I love you , baby ! 
thinks deciding on an < PROPMALE > degree was possibly not her brightest moment ... 
Apparently Western doesn't want me here ... The only counseling appointments I can make are case management appointments , and the case manager is the person who wants me to drop out of school and make appointments at some place off campus that makes me very uncomfortable . \ 
Western , I'm sorry ( no I'm not ) , but you suck . :-P 
Anybody want a female betta ? She needs to be kept by herself . 
Naptime until < PROPFIRST > gets back from work , and then homework and studying .

A 15 year old girl holds 1 year old son ; people call her a slut . But no one knows she was raped at 13 . People call a girl fat ; no one knows she has a disease that causes her to be overweight .

Wal-Mart is chock full o'lies .... I officially hate Atlanta for not being honest about the fact that there aren't any 24-hour stores in the area . It really would've been nice to know before I drove around for an hour just for rude Wal-Mart employees to yell \WE CLOSED\ " at me in the parking lot . Assholes couldn't even form a sentence . " 
Handling and restraint of POULTRY today ! ( Yup , that means chickens and turkeys . ) It's gonna be an interesting class for sure . Hahaha . And then we move on to ferrets and rabbits . :D

So , our gas station went KABOOM !!!!! I don't know if someone ran into the pump or what happened , I just know when I drove by at 6:30 all was well , and then at 9:00 is was blackened and burnt and had caution tape around all the pumps ... :-( At least it was the one with the expensive gas . If the cheap one had blown , I'd be sad . 
So far the day has brought me $2 and slightly less tacky jewelry ... I need to get rid of more of this crap - er , I mean , wonderful merchandise .... hahaha 
Yay , I made a grand total of $17.25 ! Hahahaha , wish it was more , but alas , it is too hot and both < PROPFIRST > and I keep falling asleep in our chairs . Poo on this weather !!!

Still happily dancing around the house about being asked to work at the shelter as a kennel tech and about starting as a volunteer dog trainer at the shelter , as well ! This should keep me happy until next week's interview , which hopefully will go very well and continue to keep my good mood . Or it could go horribly , but that would free me up for more hours to spend training the pups . :D 
Wheee for storms and power outages . :( Yay for laptops with long battery lives ! :D 
Interview is on Tuesday , and they asked me to stay afterward to help close . :D Sounds good to me !!!!! :D :D :D :D :D

Sad for less pay , happy because that means I'm free to take my dog to training class tomorrow night instead of having to re-do all her training ! < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Miss Daffy graduated top of her class again ! YAAAAAYYYYYY for bragging rights on a smart puppy !!!!! < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Awake and not happy about it ... :/ 
I know I shouldn't be , but I'm very upset with anyone who is having a good Saturday . Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to you all . >.< 
Just to add insult to injury ( literally ) , I must mention a few details that got overlooked this past week .... ( It was too long , so I posted as a comment instead - haha - darn you facebook !!! ) 
My face is still sore , but I'm mostly healed ! And my bruises are yellow now , so hopefully they'll be gone completely in the next day or so ! :D The only thing that isn't healing so well is the tip of my nose , and it's because I have that pesky cold so I keep having to rub tissues on it . 
Ewwwwww , my facebook changed again !!! If I didn't have so many pictures on here , I'd just delete the thing ! I haven't even fully adjusted to the last change !!! >.< 
I took my dog to PetSmart with a coupon for a free nail trim . The coupon said nothing about traumatizing my dog with your crappy service . I think they should pay me since free has no refund . :P
