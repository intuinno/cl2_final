Seems like I'm struggling to make him happy . Not in every aspect of the word but I should be making him happy all the way around shouldn't I ?? Feelin ' kinda dumb and useless ! I should know how to do these things but I dont . He says itz not that important but it is . I'm 22 and I really need to get it together ! I need to step up b4 I lose the man I love to one of these < PROPFIRST > bitches out here ! But where to start and how ? 
Bored outta my mind !! nothing on tv , nobody to talk to , nothing to do !!! AHHH !!!!! thinkin bout going to GAME STOP to get a video game ! :) that sounds like a plan !

Tryin really hard to brush it off but IDK ... maybe itz all in my head , but what if it isnt ?! 
UGH !! Work tonight ! REALLY aint feelin it ! I'm hopin that it will go by fast and i'll be back home in the morning sleep in my bed !! ----> Somtimes things dont go as planned but u can't sit and be upset about them , u jus gotta keep ya head up and move forward . Learning alot of things in 2010 ... about other people and about myself ! 
Sittin in my living room , in the dark , wondering why things happen the way that they do . Some people believe that everything happens for a reason and i used to think to but I started to question that when i loss my dad . Was there really a reason for his early departure from life ? i still needed him ... I think now so more than ever ... 
Is goin thru alot of things right now . So much on the brain that it feels like itz going to explode . Y do i keep having these constant thoughts ?? I dont wanna feellike this but the fact still remains that I do . So many people around me and yet i've never felt more alone . So many people to talk to but not one person willing to listen . I find it funny at times and sad at others . Itz weird how life plays out isn't it ?? 
For those out there that know me , and i mean really know me ... as a person . U know that im usually a happy person but something has stricken my life and made me feel like giving up . All I ask is that u PRAY for me cuz my prayers alone jus dont seem to be enough . 
finally getting this room in order !!! lovin having a uncluttered room . feeling a little homesick today ... missin my best friend like crazy ... still lovin north < PROPFEMALE > tho ... lovin my boyfriend more and more everyday . :) happy saturday yall . 
Whas poppin Facebook .... Long time no see !! how everybody doin ?? Im GREAT ! :)

Played with my dog and caught up with some old friends . Missed the boy like crazy while he was at work . Lol . U know u love some1 when u miss they're smell . Anyway ... total make over !! countdown ..... 10 days ! 
Itz funny how u can go sooo long without seein some1 or even talkin to them but the minute that u do itz like they never left to begin with ...... strange ! 
Chillin @ < PROPFEMALE > mommys house . She < PROPFEMALE > kin tacos !! mmmmm ! prolly wont get any tho . Gotta get the boy from work at 10 . I think pizza is on our menu for the night . :) I really shouldnt be eating it tho . Tryna be on a diet but itz not really workin out like i would have hoped ! im < PROPFEMALE > do it tho ya'll . Full < PROPFEMALE > kover countdown 9 days !

QUESTION FOR ----> MY LADIES <---- Are all men prone to cheating ?? \ 
Think about it .. it says ALL MEN ... \ 
We were dicusiin this at my job today , some said that itz bound to happen eventually and itz like encoded in their DNA etc .... but some disagreed . Some said that there are men out there who havent , dont , and/or wont cheat . So whats the verdict ?? 
QUESTION FOR ----> < PROPFEMALE > FELLAS <---- Why do men ( some ) cheat when they have a good thing at home ? I mean if ya girl is holdin you down all aspects of the word , whas the point ?? 
I would say TGIF if i didnt still have to work over the weekend . Lol . Hoping that today goes well .. The word of the day is \Blessed\ " .... give thanks to the lord for all u have and all that will follow . Without him there would be no us . :) Life can be hard but always keep in mind that there's someone else that's worse off than u ! Be grateful !! Love all yall .. have a great day ! "
