hopes he doesn't have to dive under any more collapsed bridges for the rest of the summer 

' s room is cleaning him 
life should consist of wheaties , green tea , and guitar all the time . well , a beach would be nice too but you can't have it all ... 
Better to get up late and be wide awake than to get up early and be asleep all day .

my baby jumped off her stand and cracked her neck ...

' s mood is solar-powered 
has 99 poplars , but a birch ain't one . 
muse was rediculous amazing ! i'll probably be deaf for a week . hopefully . 
hard work =) 
if you didn't succeed , you probably didn't try hard enough 
No , I didn't quite catch that , < PROPFIRST > . Sorry , still not getting it . 
life : less and less of it left ahead of us , more and more of it fading away behind us ... and yet there's always NOW 
trying to find your motivation is like trying to find your glasses 
wrapping what seems to be a strained calf ... 
so it turns out eating an entire box of wheaties and then trying to run 10 < PROPMALE > a half hour later just doesn't work ... 
\the time ' twixt six [ am ! ] and now must be spent by [ me ] most preciously ... \"" 
is finishing off some delicious chocolate ice cream with bananas in it and continuing to leisurely ascend Mt . Homework , after which he will go to bed nice and early and get copious amounts of sleep

ran ' til his muscles burned and his veins pumped battery acid . how long did that take ? 25 < PROPMALE > ! 
about to run ! 
guess who ran his first 80-mile week ??! 
either the brickyard race was longer than usual this year , or i should start thinking about retirement ... 
crossed the finish line yesterday dehydrated and hypoglycemic after getting lost in the woods and wandering through the trails alone for about two hours . i missed a turn and therefore didn't complete the entire 50 < PROPMALE > , but still finished my first ultramarathon of about 36 < PROPMALE > 
is \officially psycho\ " :-) " 
Hurr Durr My name is < PROPFIRST > gough and I log into facebook on other people's computers and click the stay logged in box . Then the owner of the computer logs on and says \Who the Fuck are these people sending me friend requests ? and Why does my home button take me to Goof's Profile ? " 
and instead of saying you're intersted in men and changing your activities to hobonecking on the weekends , ill just be kind and log off . 
just flew 12 < PROPMALE > . high as a kite :D 
working : 38 hours per week . running : 15 hours per week . partying : 5 hours per week . truly living in the moment : fucking timeless 
fuck bitches , run < PROPMALE > . 
just moved into my house 
these massive speakers were totally worth it lol 
found a crumpled fortune on the floor of my new room , assuring me that \it is high time for one of your most promising ideas . \ " can't wait ! "

just stayed up all night writing a paper on , among other things , the cognitive deficits induced by chronic sleep deprivation . hmm ... 
nationals ... :-) 
just had the most ridiculous < PROPFEMALE > vu ever . i think i've just been mind-fucked ... 
Some kind of happiness is measured out in < PROPMALE > . 
doesn't remeber what he traveled back in time to fix . should've known this would happen ... 
If I only had a brain ... 
christmas break- the time of year when being tired means you get to go to sleep , instead of drinking another cup of coffee . not a bad idea . 
thanks for the birthday wishes !!! hope everyone's break is going well . 
feels like < PROPFIRST > Sinatra , < PROPFIRST > Durden , and maybe even Mr. < PROPMALE > ( watch out ! ) 
Dude I'm < PROPFIRST > . 
' s mood is solar-powered . 
sleeping is for babies and for people who don't go to wabash 
If Ihad a sister would she have a c ?!??! 
accellerating like a freight train today , but at least i'm on the right track 
rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated 
could be just as satisfied laying in bed , staring at the ceiling for hours , than doing anything else . how many weeks are left ? 
is never getting a job . people are going to pay me ... just because . 
procrastination is running for 21 < PROPMALE > in order to avoid finishing a paper 
power's out ! the humans are dead . 
good things come to procrastinators who wait 
all i want to do is listen to the rhythmic breathing and footfalls on an abandoned roadway in the midday sun , but all i ever hear anymore is tedious clicking under the cold glare of a monitor . 
Has a new phone . Txt me your number ! Yeah , that means you !! 
is a professional Matlab programmer , at least for the next 7 weeks 
imma dawg , imma dawg , imma dawg 
hustled hard for 50 < PROPMALE > up and down the < PROPMALE > , muddy , itchy , buggy , and generally ... cute ... bluffs of devil's lake last saturday . props to < PROPFEMALE > Drapeau and < PROPFEMALE > Weger for keeping me alive afterwards , even if i did make scary faces at them at mile 45 ...
