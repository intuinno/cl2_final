wishes all the Dads a very Happy Father's Day ! 
will not miss < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . He was a freak , talented or not . I'll miss < PROPMALE > McMahon & < PROPFEMALE > Fawcett more 
Happy Birthday to < PROPMALE > Sanderson Jeter . How time flies . I remember when he was just a kid as a rookie & the Yanks were winning World Series . They both seem so long ago now . Sigh . 
thinks northeast weather sucks ! It's raining now for about the millionth day in a row & there's a < PROPMALE > of thunderstorms every day this holiday weekend . WTF !!!!! 
has barbecues to go to all weekend long . Have a great holiday weekend everyone . 
can't believe mother nature cooperated & didn't rain out all the bbq's I went to this weekend . Got to get back on my bike & shed all the ribs , steak & beer . I hope everyone enjoyed the holiday weekend as much as I did . 
Did you know that early this afternoon comes the moment that can be called 12:34:56 7/8/9 . Happens once a century ! Wow ! Interesting , yet meaningless at the same time . 
American League President Ban < PROPMALE > suspended Cobb indefinitely & the entire roster of the Detroit club supported Cobb by refusing to take the field unless the suspension was lifted . 
is off to NJ , NYC , < PROPFE < PROPFEMALE > LE > & < PROPFEMALE > to see my family & the Yankees . Busy week , but no work ! WooHoo ! 
Fantasy camp reunion @ the stadium was awesome on Sat . Was in a party suite with my team mates , saw < PROPFIRST > Cashman & met < PROPFIRST > Cone ( pics of all that to follow ) . Hangin ' @ Mom & Dad's for a few days now , then back to < PROPFEMALE>'s house & up to < PROPFIRST>'s for the wee 
is back to work after a week off . Blah . 
is remembering \The Captian\ " . I can't believe it's 30 years today since < PROPMALE > Munson died . " 
I was going to do the 5 things that annoy me the most & the Red Sux would have been all 5 , but I don't want that horrible logo on my home < PROPFEMALE > , so this will have to do . 
Likes that the Yanks finally beat the Sox this year . 3 1/2 game lead . Let's keep it going . 
A-Rod . Walk-Off ... Finally in 15 innings . Good Night ! 
I have to admit , I wasn't crazy about the Yanks signing AJ Burnett last off seson , but what a performance last night . I think he's growing on me . 
Yankees win . Theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Yankees win ! How sweep it is ! 
just got home from Yankee Stadium . Another awesome game . They are 5-0 this season when I'm there . 
Yanks win again in large part to my man crush < PROPFIRST > Tiexiera . lol . Way to go Tex & team . 
Just had a great 3 day weekend . Family bbq @ Sleepy Hollow Lake on Sat , bbq/pool party @ friend's house on Sun & Great Escape w/Susan , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > Mon . Great weather every day . Good tan (& a little red ) . Now back to work . 
doesn't understand how some adults can get high school & college degrees & hold descent job while being complete & total idiots their whole lives . I know I'm not the smartest person in the world , but please . Get your S *** together people . 
FYI : The previous rant does not apply to anyone of my friend list . 
Congratulations < PROPMALE > Jeter . 2,722 hits , most ever in Yankees history . It's been a pleasure to watch him play the last 15 years & I hope for many more . 
NY Giants football today ! Go Big Blue ! ( Yankee baseball too . That never takes a back seat to any team or sport ) . 
Giants won their season opener , Yanks are back on the winning track & had barbecue pork @ < PROPMALE>'s . Sounds like the perfect September Snday . 
wants to know how to find out which friends answered questions about me . Apparently I need some sort of coins to do this . How the H**L do I get these mysterious coins ? 
wishes the weekend actually meant 2 days off , but that's not the case . 
hates west coast road trips . The Yankee game doesn't start until 10pm & I have to wake up @ 6am tomorrow . 
Loves that the Giants beat the Cowboys in thier innaugural game in thier new stadium . 
just got home from Yankee Stadium after an awesome 3-0 shutout against the Sox . I am now 6 & 0 this seaon . I need to go to every post season game to ensure a World Series title fot the Yanks . Who wants to come with me ? 
Yankees win , theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Yankees win !! < PROPMALE > East champs !!! 
Regular season is over . Great year for the Yanks . Just need 11 more wins to restore sanity to the baseball world & send the World Series trophy back to the Bronx where it belongs . 
just won @ poker . Now I have drinking money for Thursday night @ bowling . 
wishes he was a cat . 
B_ST_N S_CKS !!! Who want to buy a vowel ? 
Yankees sweep , Sox got swept & the Giants are 5-0 . What a great day . 
doesn't need to know all the answers . I just wish there weren't so many questions . 
Headin ' off to The ' Burgh to see The Stillers beat the * ! #@&% out of The Browns Sunday . 
Go Yanks !!! Another sweep would be nice ! 
Happy 99th Birthday to the voice of Yankee Stadium , < PROPMALE > Sheppard . I hope to \hear\ " him back again next year . " 
thinks that while A-Rod is getting most of the attention (& deservedly so ) this October , it is nice to finally have a pitching ace show up in the post season . See past no-shows Mussina , Contreras , Vasquez , Brown , < PROPMALE > , Wright etc . Thanx CC Sabathia , nice job . 
is off to bowling in a little while , where I'm sure I'll suck since I'll be paying more attention to the Yanks on TV in the bar . That's fine though as long as they win the < PROPMALE > pennat tonight . 
I hope the Angel's team plane crashes into a mountain on the way to NY tomorrow . 
This rain out is really messing up my weekend . Nothing to do now tonight & tomorrow I won't be able to watch the Giants since the Yanks take precedence . I probably won't even play poker because I don't want to miss any of the ball game . Mother Nature really sucks . This is all very frustrating . 
is happy ! 
is headed to Jersey to go trick-or-treating with < PROPFEMALE > the Ladybug & < PROPFIRST > the Baby Dinosaur tomorrow :) 
1 more ! 
is anxious . 1st pitch in a little more than 1 hour . 
It's been rough the last 2 days after the Yanks blew game 5 , but in the grand scheme of thing it would be great to win #27 at home & beat < PROPMALE > in the process . Go Yanks ! 
Yankees win & all is good in the world !!! :) 
The parade is this Friday . Who wants to go with me ? 
is off to NYC for the Yankee parade tomorrow . 
just got home from a successful game of hold-em . Going to bed now with a few more dollars in my wallet . 
can someone please explain the point of facebook ? 
is 500 months old today ! Holy Cow ! 
is off to NJ in a little while to spend Thanksgiving with my family . To those of you who have to work this weekend , you have my condolences . To those of you going shopping on black Friday , you're insane , but regardless , I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving . 
Gettin ' ready for the Giants vs Cowboys with a couple of friends . This would be a nice game for the Giants to break out of thier slump . GO BIG BLUE ! 
My house looks great ! Thanx < PROPFEMALE > ! 
The Cowboys are my slump < PROPMALE > . Sweet ! 
I saw a lot of posts on FB on 9-11 & Veteran's Day . I hope everyone takes a moment today to remeber all soldiers & civilians who were injured & killed 68 years ago today at < PROPFEMALE > Harbor . My thoughts go out . 
If anyone needs their house cleaned ( preferably in the Capital District . Sorry to my out of town/out of state friends ) , call my friend < PROPFEMALE > @ 518-488-4797 . Most of you know that I am kind of a slob & she made my house look immaculate . No easy task there . BTW Yes I did get her permission to post her number here . Good luck all & happy cleaning < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
Well the Giants defense sucks , special teams sucks , ball handling sucks & their receivers can't catch the ball , but other than that it was a great game ... NOT !!! 
2009 Year in review : < PROPFIRST > 12-18 Yankee Fantasy Camp , the best week of my life ever . Apr 3rd Went with my Mom to the 1st game ever @ the new Yankee Stadium . May 5th my nephew < PROPFIRST > was born . October & early November MLB post season ending with the Yankees winning their 27th World Championship . The rest of the year was pretty lame & uneventful . 
Giants suck . Football sucks . Can't wait for pitchers & catchers to report for the Yanks in 45 days . 
Hates bowling !!! 
It's been 2 weeks & I'm still sticking to my new year's resolution . Might be a record . PS I still hate bowling !!! 
doesn't really care much about the NFL playoffs this year since the Giants & Steelers didn't make it , but as a Giants & Steelers fan , I'm glad the Eagles , Cowboys , Begals & Ravens all lost . The Pats too , I hate them also . 
just booked his flight for Tampa in March to go to Yankees spring training . I can't wait . As a bonus , I am flying out of NJ so I get to spend my birthday with my Niece & Nephew before leaving for FL . 
thinks the DVR is the best invention ever !!! 
wishes my Dad a Happy Birthday !!! :) 
I know A LOT of people . It's kind of sad though that there's very few of them that I \really know \"." 
loves my attached insulated garage . While the rest of you saps were scraping your winshield in -1 degree cold my car was protected & ready to go . The only way it could have been better is if I didn't have to go out @ 8am . 
My fine is $143

Top of the 3rd inning @ Fenway was the best ever , not just because the Yanks scored 2 , but < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > & TimMcCarver kept their big fat traps shut during a moment of silence for < PROPMALE > Harwell & < PROPFIRST > Roberts . RIP < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > .

Hoy cow the Yankees suck ! They're still my team & I'll be rooting for them next year , but what an embarrassment the last week was . 
is still pissed that the Yanks sucked so bad last week , but at least the Giants kicked the Cowboys ass last night . 
If < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > is a Yankee next year I'll root for him then , but today he's still a Ranger & I'm glad he got his ass kicked !
