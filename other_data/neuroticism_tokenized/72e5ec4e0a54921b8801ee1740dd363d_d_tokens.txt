knows he should read APUSH , but jusst can't bring himself to do it . 

Winter break sucks . I want it to end already . 
Just found out I failed my Bio SATII =( 
bday/xmas gifts : 2 board/puzzle games , stress balls , chocolate , t-shirt-money , r/c car , r/c helicopter thingie , bike , printer w/ ink cartridges , 2 videogames 
Another year , another Christmas . Happy holidays everyone . 
Degler is putting me to sleep . It's so long and boring ... 
I haven't been feeling like myself lately ... I mean I didn't even procrastinate today . 
Maybe I should start my homework now ... nah . 
So SATIIs are on Saturday ... and frankly , my dear , I don't give a damn . 
Platt finally posted grades for 2nd semester APUSH . I have an A ! Barely . 
Writing Myth essays late at night = NOT FUN 
Who thinks I can get away with just reading the sparknotes for The Jungle ? 
Calc homework is taking forever for me to figure out , since Stark didn't teach us anything . I miss Deruiter . 
Calc homework is starting to piss me off . 
APUSH fluff is in no way fluffy . 
I feel like an idiot for making my way to MV through the rain , only to realize that APUSH extra credit is at 7pm , not 6 . 
I should really , really start working on my essay now . Sadly , we all know that's not going to happen . 
Wow , I have over 100% in APUSH now . 
is bored out of his mind . 
Days of break passed : 5 , Amount of homework done : 0 
I'm feeling kind of normal today , which is weird ... wait , that didn't make any sense . 
Tune in tomorrow for a great matchup ! < PROPFIRST > vs . APUSH homework ! 
Hm , maybe I shouldn't have procrastinated on APUSH . Oh well , screw the APT and Jungle reading , I'll just sparknotes the quiz and wing the FRQ . 
I'm starting to lose confidence in my math skills . 
Screw APUSH studying ! I have better things to do , like ... like ... like ... huh . 
As courseloads get tougher , you're supposed to learn to manage your time better . I , on the other hand , just learn to bs my homework better . 
Debugging my sister's faulty programming code is a lot more difficult than just writing an entirely new program from scratch . 
Calc homework just took me 3 hours to finish , but that's probably because I actually tried to understand the problems and do them myself rather than copy them out of the back of the book . Still , it's ridiculous . Either this section is pretty difficult or I'm just becoming stupider . I really hope it's not the latter . 
Hmm ... maybe I should have started my APUSH fluff earlier ... 
Redundancy is redundant . 
It was so lonely in PE today . 
is a Biology Olympiad semi-finalist . Hell yeah . 
It's the vernal equinox today , for anyone who cares . 
So a bird crapped on me today ... TWICE . 
I planned out my entire day's schedule in the morning today . Let's just say I didn't stick to it . 
I am deeply superficial . 
Wearing a skirt was an interesting experience . 
So ... about how long does APUSH fluff take ? 
< insert status here > 
Are there any good Degler notes out there ? I'm really not looking forward to reading Degler 15 . 
should be studying APUSH , but is not and will not . 
Calc AP test tomorrow . Whee . 
Good luck to all fellow APUSHers tomorrow . 
Should I be happy I get to skip periods 1-4 tomorrow , or should I be sad I have to take the Bio AP test ? 
has successfully crammed 150+ pages of Bio in a little more than an hour . A new world record ! 
Now that AP tests are over , my interest in school can be modeled as an exponentially decreasing function for all t > 0 with dy/dt = - 0.5 y and y(0 ) = 10 . 
got a haircut for the first time in half a year . 
finally shaved . 
Today my optometrist told me that I'm so nearsighted that the government considers me as disabled ... 
is trying to sing . 
is currently typing his status on facebook . 
SATII tomorrow , and I haven't actually started studying ... 
A lot of people wanted me to upload my Chinese 4 video project , so here it is . Enjoy , or not . \

Mom : Shouldn't you be studying ? \ 
Me : Why ? \ 
Mom : Aren't SATs tomorrow ? \ 
Me : Oh , right . 
I got 200/200 on my myth research paper final draft . Awesome :) 
After the final , Chinese is now my lowest grade . Irony . 
I'm going to miss all my senior friends D ' : 
My parents just decided to tell me we're leaving for vacation on Tuesday , and I hate vacations :/\ 
So now my summer looks like this :\ 
6/22 - 6/27 : vacation in New York\ 
6/27 - 8/06 : internship in Boston\ 
8/06 - 8/21 : environmental work in China\ 
8/23 : school starts\ 
So much for a relaxing summer break . 
Boston > New York 
8 weeks without video games ... :( 
I'm inside an immunology research lab .... there's a lot of mice here . 
My new schedule is screwed up =/ 
I woke up today in my dorm room drenched in sweat . I checked the thermometer in my room , and it said it was 95 degrees inside the room =/ 
I need a louder alarm clock . 
I spilled a drop of sulfuric acid on my hand and it went through my gloves . It burns . Ow . 
We really need to make a contact list for all the people in research and honors ... 
Well , it was fun while it lasted , guys . Let's hope that we'll all see each other again . Here's to the best half-floor ever . 
< PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . No internet for 2 weeks D: 
I really need to start my college apps and figure out who to ask for recommendations =/\ 
Spending 9 weeks away from home really ate up my time ... 
Schedule change : Success ! 
< PROPFEMALE > , blue skies , 70 degrees . Yet another day of terrible weather . 
You know , maybe Kafka wrote The Metamorphosis just to screw with us . Maybe it doesn't have any meaning at all . After all , he laughed whenever he read it out loud . And now maybe Kafka is laughing at us in his grave as he sees us trying to analyze something that doesn't mean anything . 
I feel so awkwardly at peace right now . Where did all the stress go ? 
Crap , I just realized I misinterpreted the AP Lit IC essay prompt ... 
Gah , my laptop's display driver is dying D: 
After elaborate discussion , < PROPFIRST > Cheng and I have successfully determined whether to buy pizzas or burritos . 
Oh < PROPFIRST > Orwell , why must you disparage my writing conventions D ' : 
New laptop ! :D 
* sigh * Sometimes I wish there was a class at MV devoted to the the English language , not literature . :/ 
I really need to stop taking 4-hour naps ... 
Feeling depressed . 
is suffering from writer's block . Stupid college essays ... 
I'm starting to regret not writing a research paper D: \ 
< PROPFIRST > Chen < PROPFIRST > Ding < PROPFIRST > Kehne Abhishek Venkataramana Keegan Go < PROPMALE > Patel\ 
Stupid tag limit . 
I just spent ~ 30 minutes deriving some physics formula only to find that it was in the textbook the entire time >_> 
Writing college essays is actually kind of fun ^_^ 
Hmm ... 
All my Econ stocks went up O_o 
This Econ project is really annoying . 
I think I've screwed up my sleeping cycle - now I go to bed at 3am , wake up at 6 and sleep for 3 more hours in the afternoon . 
Hell yeah . Done with My < PROPFIRST > with two minutes to spare . 
Up at 1am writing college essays ... >_> 
IT'S 1AM ! GUESS WHAT THAT MEANS ! YUP , COLLEGE APP TIME ! 
Dressing up as bleach tomorrow for chem . I even turned a clorox bottle into a hat . 
Happy Halloween everyone ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s internal monologue for the day :\ 
Earlier today : You know , I think I'll just take a quick nap . \ 
4 hours later : Crap . 
* yaaawwwwnn * 
Finished\ 
my sonnet interp at 11:55 . These 11:59 deadlines are freaking me out D: \ 
What happened to the good ol ' days where I could pull all-nighters for this \ 
kind of stuff ? 
really needs a hug )': 
Time to get down to business . 
Why can't all school weeks be three days long ? 
Ah , Thanksgiving weekend : family , friends , food , and college essays . 
It's going to be a long week ... D: 
I think I have a 50/50 < PROPMALE > of just making it out of these next two weeks ALIVE . 
LIT PROJECT . BLARGH . 
The worst is over . 
I just received a handwritten birthday card from the University of Tulsa . I guess they really , really want me >_> 
I got an armchair , iPad , and PS3 for my birthday/Christmas ! How awesome is that ? :D 
When was the last time I woke up before 3pm ? :\\ 
Submitted college apps ! Now back to physics :\\ 
Still suffering from vacation hangover :\\ 
Hamlet logs :\\ 
I can't get the battery cover off of my new phone -____- 
Shakespeare : Full thirty times hath Phoebus ' cart gone round\ 
Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus ' orbèd ground , \ 
And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen\ 
About the world have times twelve thirties been , \ 
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands\ 
Unite commutual in most sacred bands . \ 
English : It’s been thirty years since we were married . 
Goat -> Archer\ 
Good enough for me . 
Ugh . Sick . :/ 
Princeton interview went well . 
Stats homework was basically an essay >_> 
Nothing like some Gov reading to lull me to sleep . 
I had a dream about all my film in photography class being destroyed . Scariest nightmare in years . 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day cookies ... om nom nom . 
Spent the afternoon blowing bubbles with a homemade bubble wand and solution . Brings back memories :) 
It's snowing in Cupertino ! :D 
So my mom was supposed to write some parental letter of rec for my sister ... but she made me write it instead . 
First day I've done homework all week >_> 
Washington University in St. < PROPFIRST > and UCLA . It's a start , I suppose . 
I understand now why < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is such an esteemed author - his writing has the power to put people to sleep . 
My sister left a bar of chocolate in her jeans when she threw them into the washing machine . Now all my clothes are covered in chocolate stains -_- 
\Again 
So apparently I'm a Regents Scholar ... even though I never applied for anything O_o 
It feels good to wake up at 3pm and do absolutely nothing until dinner time :) 
Sometimes I just want to punch myself . But then I realize how much that would hurt .
