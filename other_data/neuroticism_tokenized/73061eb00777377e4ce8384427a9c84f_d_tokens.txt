To all the unselfish moms out there who traded eye liner for dark circles , salon haircuts for pony tails , long showers for quick showers , late nights for early mornings , designer bags for diaper bags and wouldn't change a thing . Let's see how many mom's post this . Mom's who don't care about whatever they gave up & instead LOVE what they got in return . Post this if you LOVE your life as a MOM 
REMEMBER , this christmas , while u r eating your dinners and laughing , that in another house there is an empty chair where a hero should be sitting . They gave their life so that u can sit with ur family . So light a candle this christmas for our fallen heros that didnt make it back .. And for those still serving in Iraq , Afghanistan , or elsewhere .. Repost this as ur status to show ur respect ! 
Finishing up my cooking ! Can't wait to see the boys reaction in the morning to what < PROPFEMALE > brought them . Having kids makes every holiday 10X better :) I love my lil family !!
