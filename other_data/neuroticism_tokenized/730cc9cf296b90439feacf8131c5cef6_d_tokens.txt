“At some point you will realize that you have done too much for someone , that the only next possible step to do is to stop . Leave them alone . Walk away . It’s not like you’re giving up , and it’s not like you shouldn’t try . It’s just that you have to draw the line of determination from desperation . What is truly yours will eventually be yours , and what is not , no matter how hard you try , will never be . ” 
yay weekend =D

boredboredboredbored 
8 . You're pretty awesome , though I feel like , though I know you , I've only scratched the surface . You're fun , though . Plus you seem to get my strange random humor . 
6 . I really enjoy your company , and you give great hugs . I wish we could spend more time together . It would be alot more convenient if you didnt live in sarasota , lol . 
83 . You don't spend nearly enough time chilling with me . I consider you such a good friend , so its kind-of sad that I dont see you that often . Plus you're cute and fun so that means we should < PROPFEMALE > out . 
5 . We have been friends since before I can remember . I am very proud of you and how you've turned out through everything . You will always be my sister . clingara . 
55555 . SO it was so awesome to meet you all those years ago but it really isn't my fault that we hardly talk , cause its just as much your fault .... I miss your AHNULD impressions alot . I think its funny that you and my dad are friends on fb , and by funny i mean awesome . He loves wondering about what you are doing ( as far as the army ) and such . 
6426 . You are probably one of chillest people on stickam . You rock at singing the blues and strummin ' your guitar so therefore you are cooler in my book . 
7 . You seem super genuine and I think we should < PROPFEMALE > out more , especially if youre going to sarasota for break . Ill take you to a movie ( fo free ) . 
4040 . I've known you for a while now , and I'm super happy we are still such good friends . You're one of those people that will always be there for me , and I don't have many of those around , so I really am thankful . 
Just found out some very sad news . Off to buy a sympathy card after my paperwork session . 
I kind of wish I spent another couple days in Fort myers . Really not much to do here , seem to forget that . Oh well paperwork had to get done . Cheers to the next couple of boring days before work starts up again . 
Oh television . you make me LOL . so < PROPFEMALE > Palin has a tv show AND shes going camping with Kate+8 . wtf has this world come to . welcome to Amurrcuh 
Is going to start creating a bucket list . Something to make me motivated . Cause man , I need some motivation . 
You are all geniuses , and you are all beautiful . You don't need anyone to tell you who you are . You are what you are . Get out there and get peace , think peace , and breathe peace , and you'll get it as soon as you like - < PROPFIRST > Lennon 
Note : Baked kale chips do not taste as good when you burn them . 
You can't run away from your reality . Its f'n stuck with you every day . So man up and deal with it . 
Without laptop for 2 ish days . Let's see how this ipad works for my Internet addiction . 
Is there anyone in sarasota who would like to see a movie .... For free , with me ?

Once she found a man to treasure and together they'd planted flowers of warning , fearing frost . \ 
Late on the shallow evenings while their enemies slept , they hammered the soil asking for answers in green . \

Life isn't about finding yourself . Life is about creating yourself .

Is having a lovely dinner with < PROPFEMALE > Ranno . Ravioli with red wine tomato sauce and a lovely glass of red wine . 
New Vegas , homework , New Vegas , homework . what to do what to do ? 
C'mon day . Get better . 
Sweet words and passionate promises won't make me forget . The doors have closed , the moment has passed . The reality of what was still lingers . It will take more than any heartfelt anything to make me forget what you have done , said , and felt ( or not felt ) . I will not be weak . I will not be the innocent puppy-eyed being I once was . 
Sprite 
Getting my tire fixed . Woo . :/

I may not be the most beautiful or sexiest woman , nor do I have the perfect body . I may not be everybody's first choice , but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm good at being me . I may not be proud of some things in my past , but I am proud of who I am today . So take me as I am , or watch me as I walk ... away . Post if you're proud of being you !
