People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness . They are not looking for a cure , only acceptance . 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you be in the 7% that will and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Special Education Week : March 22-26

They say truefriends go long periods of time w/out speaking & never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live . They understand that life is busy , but you will always love them .. Re-post if you have at least one of these friends . :) 
Why do I even bother to update anything ? 
I'm planning on going to Minneapolis Community Tech Collage in May , it's the earliest month I can get in by now because I gotta get loans , grants , & figure out all that other stuff . -_-

I may not be the most beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be someone's first choice , but I am a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm good at being me . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past but I'm proud of who I am today . Take me as I am or watch me as I walk away . ? Post if you're proud of being you .
