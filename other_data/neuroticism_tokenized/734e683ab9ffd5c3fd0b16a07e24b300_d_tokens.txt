And what country can preserve its liberties , if its rulers are not warned from time to time , that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ? Let them take arms . The remedy is to set them right as to the facts , pardon and pacify them . What signify a few lives lost in a century or two ?

What is it about love ? Doesn't anyone have any respect for themselves , let alone their CHOSEN companions ? No worries , I'm not having issues . I'm just depressed that SO many people seem to have so little respect . The best you can do is talk , and that's really not that difficult .

Remember the three R's: Respect for self ; Respect for others ; and Responsibility for all your actions . =) 
Today was Aeyen's first day of Kindergarten . She seems so big , and so little at the same time . I'm sure that's the way it'll always be . lol She's too damn cute though . I'll put pics . up later . 
I need a better way to meditate or something ... I don't want to be angry , I don't like to feel angry . I hate injustice in any form . I need an emotional vacation . blah blah blah\ 
You know , when it really matters happens to be the times when I don't want to post what's going on . I'm sh*t out of luck right now , and there's not a d*mn thing I can do about it . My own logic is working against my emotion , and I'm pissed . AAAAA !

Also , let's get rid of the ' Don't Ask , Don't Tell ' Policy . For one it's not properly administered & two , it's ridiculous & wrong . We may as well say that only either males or females can be in the military , or only 1 particular race , or perhaps only people who have brothers and sisters , or people who's parents are not divorced .. Get my drift ? \

FYI : The National Cancer Institute says esophageal cancer affects about 16,500 Americans each year , almost 80 percent of them men .

In case you were dying to know . \ 
So does anyone here like the Daily Show ? lol\ 
I want to go to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s Rally to Restore Sanity ! \ 
Wanna ' come with ? =) 
I told myself a long time ago that I'd stay away from people who bring me down , because even if you care about them you can't help them . I also thought I'd never need to remind myself of that ; but I should also know you don't ever say never . 
I hope you all have a peaceful night . * 
10 - 10 - 10\ 
My lucky day ... ;) 
\It's a little bit funny 
So is being gullible really that bad ? Is it so wrong to give people a < PROPMALE > to be honest and mature ? \ 
Maybe for just SOME people , you shouldn't believe them right off-the-bat . What a shame ; for them anyway . 
GUESS WHAT , GUESS WHAT , GUESS WHAT ?! \ 
I AM going to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Colbert on the 30th , and it won't be through a television .... :D 
Someone please ... say something nice . =) \ 
I'm so sick of negative at the moment . 
Nighty-night 
So ... it looks like a have a job ! Go me . lol\

Please , put this on your status if you know someone who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity , and sympathy does not help ... But we can raise awareness . 93% of people won't re-post this because they don't know how to copy and paste . LOL\ 
JK ... sort of . 
GOODNIGHT , goodnight . At 7:30 , I'm heading out . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ; < PROPFIRST > Colbert - HERE I COME ! \ 
Woooo ! \ 
Hectic ! But quite exciting . :) Ready for bed , now that I'm in my super cozy hotel . aahhh ... \

Ah ... November . \ 
Why are you burning up ? 
A Veteran is someone who , at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the USA for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran , child of a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love a Veteran , or support the Troops ! 
Going to Souplantation ! Oh no , did I just give out my whereabouts ? Oh well . =) Come and get me ! 
Souplantation = Not so great .. 
Just got some extremely bad news . That sucks . \ 
Gotta ' persevere though . Unfortunately , I'm really unsure how at the moment . I wonder when I'll actually flip . Kinda ' in a trance at the moment ... lol

You know , I've been quite surprised lately . Apparently surprises are not all bad . Too bad things can't do a complete 180 without turning into a spinning top .. 
AND ... I'm horribly sick . But not so much that I can't enjoy the fact that I have internet again . * weak grimace ... lol

It's kind of difficult to be honest with people now and then , because honestly you don't want to say something that could really screw with someone else's head ( if it may be bad ) , but at the same time ... if they ask you for your opinion ... I mean ... I want to be honest . lol I'll just dig deep . 
Today is going by sooooo slowly . Why ?! 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good night . 
Trying to fully figure out how staying the same typically brings about change .

Though I have been described many times as an old soul , I fear I have a tired soul . Won't someone revitalize me ? =) 
Aaaaaaah ... \ 
What a b-e-a-utiful day . lol\

Goodnight FB peeps 
Seriously , some people need to mature . The least you could do is act just above your age . I'm not saying if you're 18 to act 40 .. Just grow up . :) 
Do your chain < PROPFEMALE > low ? 
So I really need to finish packing and then get my * ss to bed . =) 
So we're at our Hotel ' The Liaison ' now . It feels good to not be on a plane or in a vehicle .. Hello D.C. ! 
I'm worried about these people ... 
Waiting for our Shuttle to the Airport to head back to California . I really like D.C. It's a lovely city . I shall return . lol 
Touchdown .. Hi L.A. 
I have tattoos , so I'm a trouble maker . I have curves , so I'm fat . If I wear makeup , I'm fake . If I say what I think , i'm a bitch . If I cry sometimes , I'm a drama < PROPFEMALE > . If I have guy friends , I'm a slut . If I stand up for myself , I'm mouthy . Seems like you can't do anything nowadays without being labeled . So what , go ahead and label me , see if I care . Re-post this if you're proud of who you are ! ( Or don't . ) ? 
So who here is a hedonist ?
