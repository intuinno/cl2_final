On the morning of September 11 , 2001 , MacFarlane was scheduled to return to Los < PROPFEMALE > on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston , Massachusetts .

Fifteen minutes after departure , American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked , and at 8:46 a.m. was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center , obliterating the airplane , and killing everyone on board . \ 
Thank God for him getting drunk . \ 
P.s. I'm not encouraging drinking . 
Cooking spagetti and feeling like a man doing it . 
It's hard to explain to someone who has no clue . It's a daily struggle being in pain or feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside . Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has an invisible illness ( PTSD , Anxiety , Bipolar , Depression , Diabetes , Lupus , Fibromyalgia , MS , ME , Arthritis , Cancer , Heart Disease , Epilepsy , Autism , M.D. Meniere's Disease etc . ) \ Never judge what you don't understand I know which of my real friends will copy .
