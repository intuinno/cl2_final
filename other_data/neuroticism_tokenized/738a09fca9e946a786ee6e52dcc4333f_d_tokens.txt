well , happy new year guise . welcome to 2011 . :D 

Am working . 
Want a tattoo , but don't know what to get . Post suggestions pl0x . 
Didn't care about 9/11 ;\ 
Don't care about mosque . 
Just looked outside . Finally the weather is improving . I hope it stays like this . Hopefully it rains too . 
Have you ever wanted to beat someone to death ? 
Last week interning . After this is over then I can get a real job , get money , and I'll be a free man again . Life as an adult is so close . 
Worked Oncology today . It was most awesome and the kind of job that would be my ideal . Any kind of working with toxic chemicals that could kill you with one whiff really rattles my chain , you know ? 
Lurking for job now . Last time I did a job hunt , it sucked . Hopefully this time it won't suck that much . 
I don't have any headphones . :[ 
­ 
Trying to get a job . Not very motivated . Going for hospital , but I'll probably end up settling for retail . 
Dying my hair black . 
I guess it's about time to violently search for a job . Cause not having a car I can use is no fun at all . 
( ??, _ ?,? ) I think I might've lost my phone . I spent hours retracing my steps trying to find it . It was such a nice phone too ... I miss it already ... bawwwww 
I got a new phone ! So , if everyone could give me their phone number then I won't have to bother you about it later . 
HAY GUIZE IS ERRYBODY HAVIN A GRATE DAYYYY ?? 
HAY GUISE , if you don't already know , imma go to los < PROPFEMALE > for about a week or so . so if you wonder where I am , i'll be over there . 
I got an interview with kaiser ! let's hope I get this job so I can actually have money for once . 
I GOT A JOB WITH KAISER !!! :D 
Happy Birthday to me
