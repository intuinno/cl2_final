got my BIBLE . got my coffee . ready to jumpstart my day . 
God confirming things himself is so so powerful and motivating . 
Sometimes when your in God's purpose , it seems surreal . As if it's to big for a small person like you . That's the enemy . NOTHING IS TO BIG FOR GOD . We need to stop limiting His annointing in our lives with our selfish , worldly mindsets . 
Finally ! got my Bible and Coffee . a little late , but better than never

WHERE DO YOU SEE YOUSELF IN THE FUTURE WITH THE HABITS YOU'VE DEVELOPED TODAY ? 
EMOTION IS A POWERFUL THING . BUT OUR SPIRIT RULES OVER ALL ! OUR SPIRIT LONGS TO WALK WITH GOD . SO WE NEED NOT BE AFRAID TO CUT OUT ALL FLESHLY THINGS , WHICH MAY NOT BE ALL BAD , AND WALK WITH GOD ALONE ! 
We are Spirit Beings . We are just inhabitants of our flesh . Much like a car . We are inside the car and controlling it as we drive . Yet we are not the car . 
Should God then reward you on your terms , when you refuse to repent ? You must decide , not I ; so tell me what you know . Job 34:32 -34

Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me , and I will listen to you . You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart . I will be found by you , declares the LORD , and will bring you back from captivity ....

IS IT WRONG TO GET A TATTOO ???? 
Verse of the day Jesus Christ was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification . - Romans 4:25 
Do you have the AUDACITY to Love GOD !!!??? 
Do you have the AUDACITY to truly give your life to GOD !!!??? 
God is sooo good ! 
MOVE FORWARD !!!! Never sit still . When your doing God's will you should be in a constant state of MOVEMENT . 
TIME FOR THE NEXT LEVEL !! 
i think it's time ! 
Is God pushing you out the nest or place of confort , Or is Satan trying to distract you ??? Seek the lord and he will reveal to you and give you wisdom on what to to next ... ... Deuteronomy 4:29 
PATIENCE ... Do you TRULY have it ? How long are you willing to wait ? Are you open to change ? ... Colossians 1:11 
GOD is good His mercy , kindness , goodness , < PROPFEMALE > , power , endures FOREVER AND EVER !!! 
After you read this stop everything ! Take a moment to just think of all the things GOD has done for you and give HIM praise and thanks ! Even if you don't feel like it ... There's a blessing in it ! 
Life is beginning to make a whole lot of sense ! Thank GOD ! 
SELF CONTROL ... Can you control urself ??? sometimes it's hard . Whats in ur spirit ? You are a spirit which posses a soul and only live in a body . Our spirit should have control ... So again , What Is In Your Spirit ???

Dear children , do not let anyone lead you astray ... He who does what is sinful is of the devil , because the devil has been sinning from the beginning ...
