Someday .... 

The truth is no one knows how the garden grows . 
Gonna be a super ultimate < PROPFEMALE > rockstar\ 
of the band \Darker Than Blue \"" 
LOVE ....... ANNDD ....... PEEEEEEEAAAACCCCCCEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
for no one by the beatles 
going to bed 
What to do about you .... 
Sitting at the coffee shop doing nothing at all ........ \ 
\ 
How many times can you say bored ...? 
I am now just leaving the coffee shop .... 
Sometimes .. the best way to look at yourself is through somone else's eyes .. \ 
Tables they turn sometimes . 
Sigh ....... 
Wow .. I just got an interveiw from the Lonsdale Newspaper ... \ 
Ima gonna be in the newspaper ! 
The longer one holds on to a memory , the longer one lives in the past . \ 
The deeper the memory they hold onto , the more beautiful the past will\ 
become . The beautiful memories will eventually turn into hate . Even if\ 
they look ahead , they lose the ability to walk . As long as the heavy\ 
chain called revenge continues to bind the heart , the tears of sadness\ 
will continue to flow . 
There's something that cannot be\ 
expressed in words , human emotion . Emotions of the heart can't be just\ 
tucked away in a closet . There's a way to know the emotions . Look into\ 
the eyes . The girl lied to me , and I believed her . The gentleman lied\ 
to me , when I trusted him , but the moment I looked into his eyes the\ 
angel of < PROPFEMALE > began to unravel the truth . Just look into their eyes . \ 
There is only one truth . 
People expose the weaknesses which pain them , \ 
and thus form a group . Before they know it they begin to exclude those\ 
who are not one of them , but what becomes of those who have been\ 
excluded ? I smiled at the children who lived in a tight group in their\ 
rickety house . Sure , let's live today , let's live tomorrow , and let's\ 
live the day after that , even if it means living in eternal pain . 
Here I come with my second wind 
and my phone will be back on tuesday hopefully 
off to homework .. 
Alllooohhh 
Looks like winter's here -- Little Boys have been falling all night and now the ground is completely covered ! I almost couldn't get out of the house ; this stuff is up to my Liver . So I got out a Clock and < PROPFIRST > them into a pile . Obama and I have been jumping in it all day . I'm hoping that the weather changes , though ; before Christmas I really want to make Poison angels .

Wednesday is < PROPFEMALE > birthday =P 
In times of hardships , in times of sadness , there's a place a traveler can let his mind return to : home . I still don't know what kind of a past the traveler abandoned when he left his home behind . I still don't know what kind of sorrow he bears . But the traveler can keep walking forward because he has something which sustains him ... a place which accepts him . He can walk forward , step , by careful step . 
spam spam spam

Happy Birthday < PROPMALE > .... =) 
GOSH DARN IT I CANT BELIEVE I MISSED < PROPFIRST > AGAIN !!! UGGHHHH 
no snowball 
Look it's tomorrow =3 
hm .... 
Whenever something is gained , something is always lost . \ 
It's difficult to live after something like that . What is lost will never return . \ 
Important things , irreplaceable things , but what is needed to keep those things is in the firm will packed into one bullet . Man knows , he knows nothing will begin unless he speaks , and that nothing will change , unless he moves . \ 
Sigh .. 
March 6th 
March 6th .... :\

Worst . \ 
Day . \ 
Ever ... 
Stalk me 
Keep your eyes fixed on the sun >=) 
( continued)The gentleman had lied to me , when I trusted him . The young woman lied to me , and I believed her , but the moment I looked into her eyes the angel of fate and certainty exposed to the truth within the heart . All you have to do is look into the eyes . There is only one truth 
There is something that is almost impossible to translate into words , human emotion . The heart’s emotions can’t be implanted into the earth , because it can only grow into something uncontrollable . There's a way to fathom the emotions . Just read the eyes . 
=(
