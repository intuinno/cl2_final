is really upset . 

preparing for a night of free drinks , free food , and 60 horses ... its complicated 
is ready to destroy < PROPMALE > nightlife ! One . Millionaire . at a time ... XD 
forgot what sleep is ... 
fml 
Great Weather and Relaxation ... :) 
Last night was a night to remember .... 
Until the meek inherit the world , they will pass on a tradition forever known as debt . 
Just helped fill the < PROPMALE > dump by renouncing the way of the pack rat . I feel like I could travel anywhere now ! 
I4 Onramp + Foreign Object = 3AM Tire Change 
Playing piano outside with friends is perfect in this awesome weather . 
DROID ! 
Dragging a 160lb tire is for SPARTANS ONLY ! 
Florida should be renamed the A\\C State ... 
Good night to be with friends ! 
Enjoying employer paid airconditioning never felt so good . 72 degrees or bust 
Sarasota is old and beautiful ... ( appreciate the lack of following mom joke ) 
Mountain biking over trees for 4.2 < PROPMALE > destroys boredom . Sports , TV ? What's that . 
Mountain Biking 11 City Block Laps is over 8 < PROPMALE > . 1 Gallon of water destroyed ... 
Lake Eola 1919 . Special thanks to my new , old friend < PROPFEMALE > for documenting her life lived entirely in < PROPMALE > since 1941 . 
Tractor tire pulled 300 ft , flipped 175 ft , ran 2.46 < PROPMALE > . A good workout to start the week ! HAAAAAAAHHHHHH ! Run & Run Again , Until Rabbits Become RAMS ! 
another day & another 5.25 k run outta the way . 
If you can find a path with no obstacles , it probably doesn't lead anywhere . - < PROPFIRST > A . < PROPMALE > 
hopes everyone is doing well . 
\You're not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty . \"" 
Lake Eola is whole again , the fountain looks amazing this time of night . 
What dreams did you < PROPMALE > to get here ? 
It's not about changing your song to the tune of others , it's about playing yours , however annoying to some , until you find that someone who appreciates it just because ... 
This buzz is making me think that while I might love you all , I desperately want each one of you to obtain the top one wish you've been hoping for , whatever it is . Luck/ < PROPFEMALE > / Free Will/ Faith/ Hope be with each and every one of my friends . : ) ! 
Why do they call it Time Shares when the only thing shared is space ...? 
Philosophy is a rehearsal for death . -Plato 
Keep your dreams as priority one ! 
believes that even though a man thinks he understands a woman , the only thing he really knows are his struggling perceptions of the mysterious , the beautiful & the cruel ... WOe_is_MAN 
The only thing I know is that I don't know . 
The < PROPFEMALE > looks amazing over Eola . 
thinks the Universe is creepily Chaotic & poetically Organic all at Once &\ 
observing the world as dense layers warps your perceptions so\ 
just don't forget which vibrating sphere is you & notice that\ 
the white-noise of consciousness has a certain ring to it . \

Eureka Ohm 
mountain-biked through < PROPMALE > a total of 974 < PROPMALE > ( approximate b4 theft >_<) in the last 3 months but is happy to have the car running again ! It was nice saving money on gas and discovering my pique physical condition . 
I will never take my car for granted EVER again ... 
Being selfless is only good in moderation ; Once you've given too much it's hard to be selfmore ... 
, oh where did that cool weather go !? Screw the fountain of youth , let's look for Florida's A/C \on\ " switch ! Maybe it's next to some alligator bones under Magic Kingdom ...? " 
I just had a sinking feeling that I don't take life with enough pause in my step ; that perhaps I'll blink for too long and my eyes will water with regret , without a second to spare ... 
Good music and good friends made my night . Feels great to get out of routines . 
is almost done with his disguise ... 
is off to work now , and looking forward to what should be a very remarkable night ... then day ... then night again ... A nicely chaotic weekend for sure ! :D 
I know I COULD party hop , but simplicity will win out this weekend ( meaning only 3 or 4 ) . Hello 5 hour energies for the next 30 hours of parties ( what's ur 2:30 AM feel like ? ) . I see pumkpins & want pie ... ~_~* 
Fourth meal is on ! Happy Halloween everyone ! My only question is why are you still sober ?! 
24 hours awake and roughly 20 to go . Happiness is unrestrained movement to the beat . Feels good pulling all nighters again , ah memories ... 
Hopes everyone enjoys their Halloween . Remember , < PROPFEMALE > = Nightmares 
need coffeee .... must make it past , LOUD BIRDS , ugh . ~_-* 
Coffee + Workout = Caffdrenaline ; Glad I can start the week with a night out , I'm pretending it's Friday & tomorrow's Thursday ... helps me cope :D 
Hesitate Less & Succeed More 
I would have come back for you , just needed to do what I had to do ... 
Just had a minivan go the wrong way down < PROPMALE > in my < PROPFIRST > . I know these streets are confusing , but I want to live 0 . o 
Romance is a choice , similar to receiving a < PROPFEMALE > , we can choose to enjoy the passion of it or we can choose to suspect the thorns ... 
A good ten hours of sleep was much overdue . Overcast & cool is how I like Florida . 
Nothing Worthwhile comes easily ; Heart , Home & Country ... 
Ah , the cool weather has helped me forget what state I'm in . 
Anyone who brings me a cheeseburger would be my hero . Magic ahead , stomach behind # . x 
is hungry for pizza , wishing Lazy < PROPFEMALE > was portable . 
Missing the cold weather already . Bah 
Can't stop thinking about the great lunch I had , the wonderful weather to have it & all the fun it turned out to be ... ;-) 
Just when I least expected it , I've been pulled under a tidal wave of passion in the best of ways ... 
Communication is my favorite Technology 
feels disconnected from humanity sometimes ... 
Why do I read the news ... it's like I forgot what it feels like to roll around in glass so I try again thinking it won't be painful ... yep , still pointlessly painful . I'm sure McMedia has more than money in mind ... right ? More than my eyes shifting over ad-space and clicking banners ...? 
Nice day 
Was having a Romantic day at the park that got cut far too short by the rat race of work . Time is the only distance I cannot overcome for you , my Dear , but doubtless it will close in passing ... so til then ... ;-) 
Free will begets uncertainty , thus a playful life 
It's finally cold enough for me to pretend I'm not in Florida , which for the day is an F word . So excuse my language ... 
Happy Year of the Rabbit
