I'm having a bad day already . Damn alarm clock didn't go off ... I had 15 minutes to get ready for work ! I really hope the whole day doesn't go like this . 
I LOVE MY JOB , I LOVE MY JOB , I LOVE MY JOB * I TELL MYSELF THIS ALL DAY , KNOWING I'M LYING TO MYSELF ! * 
OMG ! How can some people be so LAZY ? 
I do not want to be here ! I just want to go home ... this day has been 10 hours of hell ... now to make it through the last 2 hours . 
There are two types of people . Givers , and takers . Givers give until there is nothing left to give , yet takers still want more ...

C . A . B . H & K.N.J I just wanted you two to know what goes around comes around ... the hateful things you two have done will come back to bite you on the a ** ... I just hope I'm around to see it ! BTW K.N.J YOU MAY WANT TO SEEK MENTAL HELP . SENDING ME LETTERS SAYING GOD PUT YOU HERE TO DESTROY ME ... SOUNDS LIKE THE VOICES IN YOUR HEAD WERE LYING TO YOU ! But did you two really need to destroy my children lives also . 
First of all C.A.B.H you may want to learn how to spell before you decide to call me STUPID ... it's spelled STUPID . NOT STUPIED ! And I know most likely you or K.N.J will read this , because you two are obsessed with cyberstalking me(for whatever reason I have yet to figure out ) ... that does not give you control over me . It just means for some reason you two have decided to make my life the center of your world ... LMAO

If someone says mean , hurtful , or hateful things about you : Just remember , what they have said is an inner reflection of how they feel about themselves . 
Your delusions of grandeur amuse me !

Why do my drunk neighbors always ask me to take them to the store ?? 
My neighbors apartment caught on fire ... she lost all 3 of her cats ... so sad ... the oldest one was 16 years old . Fire dept . Says I can't go back into my apartment , due to heavy smoke damage and it is unsafe to turn the electricty back on ... WHAT A WAY TO START A HOLIDAY WEEKEND ! 
Silence is golden ... Duct tape is silver .
