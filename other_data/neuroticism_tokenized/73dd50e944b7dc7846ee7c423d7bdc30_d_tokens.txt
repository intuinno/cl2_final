your reflection isn't something you merely look at from the outside , it's also something can be viewed from the inside but so many people ( me included ) fear themselves or are caught up in themselves that they simply refuse to see who they have become or better yet who they will be ......... so always try to look and see where your at in life and make sure you know who you are .......

Animosity - in the midst of ill willed conflict it is only natural that such a disticnt feeling rises to the surface . Act on it or brush it off , better yet can either of these be a valid option ?
