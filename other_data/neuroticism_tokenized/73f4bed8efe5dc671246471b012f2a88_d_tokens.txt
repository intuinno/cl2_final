\You may be out of my sight but never out of my mind \ " ~ Unknown Author "

for someone who never gets sick ... this thing is really kicking my butt :-/ 
the good thing about being sick on the weekend ... there are movies on tv ... i'm sick of wifeswap 
yay almost all of my white spots are gone ... now if only i wasn't so tired all the time 
to the world when you are in sweats , who holds your hand in front of his friends , who thinks you ' re just as pretty without makeup on . One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have YOU ... The one who turns to his friends and says , ' thats her ' .... \ - Unknown " 
sometimes i wonder ...

\You find your faith has been lost and shaken\

“All the good things in life involve a certain risk , but the biggest risk in life is missing out . ” ~ < PROPFIRST > Corbano 
had a great long weekend ... a nice lunch outside with my sisters , went to see Godspell ( awesome ) , enjoyed the beautiful weather , read a great book ( in a day , with some really good insights ) , spent a nice afternoon with my mom and an ice cream at the park , got some sun .... just hoping < PROPMALE > pulls through this , poor cat doesn't deserve what's happening to him :-( 
time to play musical cars again ... we have 3 usable cars and 5 people with different places they have to be tomorrow .... it's like a mathematical equation ... or a puzzle ... either way it's getting to be a little much :-/ 
yay for the 4-day week ... one more day till my 3-day weekend ... and excited i tried something new today ... got a free eye-brow wax ( first one ever ) :-) 
something to think about ... \men are like rubber bands\ " and \ " women are like waves \"" 
thinking about going to < PROPMALE > with everyone tonight .... 
best thing about today - < PROPFIRST > got a job :-) 
haha just got asked to dance by a 40-something-year-old guy tonight ... kinda creepy ... but i'll be laughing about it for a while :-D 
a long couple dreary days so of course it's a watch-lifetime-in-your-pajamas kind of day .... today i've already watched a movie about a woman who had an affair with her new husband's son , and a movie about a woman who has an affair with a man who turns out to be her own son\ 
lifetime is messed up 
i've been thinking about it for a couple weeks ... today's the day ... i'm finally going to do it ... 
my new favorite thing ..... coming home for lunch :-) 
i keep attracting the indian men .... hmmmm 
is so discombobulated right now ... just woke up from a 2 1/2 hour nap thinking i had to go to work ... haha i had the same amount of sleep last night and already worked this morning 
bring on the next couple weeks ... it's time to pick up some over-time :-) 
i think it's ridiculous how everyone just decides to be a fan of a sport all of a sudden because their \home team\ " is doing well ... i never liked soccer and i'm not going to start liking it now because team usa won something " 
that's why today was the way it was ... the full < PROPFEMALE > is out ... : -0 
has itchy feet ... i guess spending time outside the past few nights had a slight downfall ... oh well definitely worth it ... oh and i loooooove having mondays off :-) 
\Here's in hoping that everyone who has genuine love to offer is given the love they truly deserve ! \ " ~ Unknown " 
realized i was happy today for the first time in MONTHS ... it's a great feeling :-) 
working on my tan and my green thumb :-) 
yyeeessssssss ... now i have pink eye :-( 
off to the Cape for the day ... for some family fun :-) 
friday night = date night ..... out tonight 
\Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation . \ " ~ Kahlil Gibran "

laundry night ... and home-run derby ... i love baseball :-) 
had a fabulously free dinner ... time to watch some all-star players :-) 
48 hours :-) 
finishing last minute packing ..... then off ... 
after a 17hour drive , 1 hour of sleep , a swim and < PROPFIRST>'s crab shack ... finally off to sleep :-) 
i loooooooooove vacations :-) 
Happy hour on the beach :-) <3 
if i didn't have such sun-bleach-blonde hair right now i'd think i looked like a black man ... haha 
best way to spent the last day of vaycay ... vineyard with a buffet & < PROPMALE > music festival :-) 
I don't think mother nature wants us to enjoy DC ... we were rained on on the way down and are now hitting more rain on the way back :-\\ 
after a yummy dinner in baltimore back on the road again ... ahh road trips 
sleeeeep .... finally 
back to the real world tomorrow :-( \ 
but it'll be nice to be back on a regular sleeping schedule again 
i'm in love ..... with a kitten named < PROPMALE > <3 
i love family dinners <3 ... especially when they're productive 
\SHOOT THE GAP !! \""

\The key to making a man want you all to himself is to be the woman who loves him but doesn’t need him . \ " - unknown " 
rearranging the house ... it's going to be a long 3 weeks ... but we can do it ... and we'll see how the experiment of everyone living together again goes ... 
another week ... another < PROPFEMALE > ( if that ) ... 
is going to try and enjoy the nice big white comfy couch as much as i can before it gets sent into storage ... :-( 
watching a movie ... then the sox with < PROPFEMALE > ... haven't been spending enough time with her lately ... i love low key nights like this :-) 
i love getting paid and i hate getting paid ... it's nice to see that money for the split second it's it your account ... but when you see how much you actually get it almost doesn't feel worth it ... 
i never thought i'd hear myself say this ... but ... i'm kind of glad summer is coming to an end ... the heat and humidity were definitely overwhelming this year 
is < PROPFIRST > Michaels seriously co-hosting the Miss Universe pageant ? \ 
what is this world coming to ? 
\don't waste the pretty\ " ... i'm trying not to " 
looking forward to the next couple months ... two concerts , a date , a wedding , an audition , and a mini vacation :-) 
times i wonder is it ever worth working at all , we never get all the money we earn , 90% of it goes to credit cards , loans , bills , our last $10 in the bank goes to gas that may fill 1/4 tank\ 
if we save , it goes to fix a car , medical emergency , education , food/drink , roof over our heads\ 
what are we doing ? \ 
is there really a meaning behind it all , or are we all just hamsters running inside wheels doomed to never get out ? 
i think my hamster wheel is accelerating down hill ..... soon it will be under water with no escape 
screw feng shui ... i'll fung my own shway 
\Some people keep their brains\ 
poor < PROPMALE > ... he just got freaked by a loud crack of thunder ... but then returned to eating his food ... aahhhhhh to be a cat 
\I should answer the door 
watching The Notebook :-) \ 
love this movie 
off to a wedding\ 
<3 <3 <3 
one sister home ... 
happy Fall :-) 
yea ... i'm done\ 
\ 
don't you just wish you could say that sometimes ? \ 
to the people/person you really want to say it to ? \ 
and go through with it ? 
can't wait to go on my double date with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Trace Adkins tomorrow night ;-) 
The Amazing Race season premiere :-) 
everyone says \it'll all work out in the end\ " \ 
i'm lovin ' this car <3 \ 
do i have to give it back ? 
i think our family is falling apart ... \ 
sisters are moving home , one was in a car accident , the other had surgey , my computer died , dad's fell down the stairs , dad's car smoked , auntie fell ... \ 
i probably missed something but i guess it would be a good thing if it wasn't memorable enough to remember after a week of playing the chauffer and a mover 
drinkin ' wine and watching a movie with mom :-) 
watching true bood for the first time ever ... i love it after just one episode :-) 
likes it hanging off the side of the kitchen chair :-) 
feels very productive ... she helped build a house today with Habitat for Humanity North Central Massachusetts and some co-employees of Avidia Bank ... probably the best day's work she's had in .... actually probably ever :-) 
\It ain't possible to live unless you crossing somebody's line\ " ~ True Blood " 
wishes this very loooong weekend wasn't over :-( :-( :-( \ 
do i really have to go back to work tomorrow ? 
thanks everyone :-) 
celebrating with eri , a few drinks , and true blood :-) 
came to the realization earlier that as of 2 days ago i am now a cube :-) \ 
haha\ 
someone please laugh with me , or even at me , because then i won't feel like such a dork thinking that is funny :-) 
YAY ! Birthday dinner ! :-) 
relaxing with a glass of wine , a lap of Stewie , and Son's of Anarchy :-) \ 
Yay , for having tomorrow off 
\It's like design diarrhea . \ " ~ < PROPMALE > Gunn " 
pizza ... wine ... and the whole house to myself :-) 
No one is completely sure why we have sinuses , but some researchers think they keep the head from being too heavy . Sinuses are also are responsible for the depth and tone of your voice . This explains why you sound like < PROPMALE > Eastwood when your sinuses are all stuffed up . ~ WebMD 
i love it ... i get to teach my dad how to use his new phone :-P

thoughts on Undercover Boss\ 
~ i love how it shows that just because someone's the owner/CEO doesn't mean they know squat about anything\ 
~ how come one person will get a promotion or college education when another will get something as trivial as a break room ?

so much fun :-) \ 
can't wait for family christmas next weekend 
maybe we'll finally get the white-out storm i've been hoping for ... none of this 2-5 inches ( that's just annoying ) 
dear snow gods , \ 
you got it wrong . you were supposed to give us enough snow to close everything for a couple days . you let me down . 
oh boy has it been a great week ... \ 
slid into a tree on monday in the storm on my way to work ... \ 
car accident this morning on my way to work ... \ 
what's the common denominator ? GOING TO WORK !!!!! 
well , 2010 , we had some good times and we had some bad times , but you definitely taught me a lot about life and myself , thanks for the memories ... i'm ready to take on whatever 2011 has for me , the good and the bad , so lead the way 
thank you mother nature for answering my wishes ... i appreciate the storm that helped me not have to go to work today :-) 
i had more fun shoveling today with my family than i do on a normal at work ... :-) 
can i just say ... \ 
i will be happy when everyone under the sun stops discussing football till they're blue in the face 
\it's a new < PROPFEMALE > ... it's a new day ... it's a new life ... \"" 
the difference between hallmark and lifetime movies :\ 
hallmark is corny and always about love\ 
lifetime is about falling in love with your husband's son ... or even daughter 
yesterday for the first time since i started on ww someone noticed i've lost some weight :-) 
can't wait to do taxes so i can pay off a credit card :-) 
can't wait to go to sleep in my brand new bed tonight :-) 
whoever made mother nature so mad , please apologize ... she's torturing all of us 
i think i'm a Criminal Minds addict :-)

why do so many things depend on who you know ? 
There are the normal ( . )( . ) , the silicone ( + )( + ) , the perfect ( o)(o ) Some are cold (^) (^) and some belong to grandmothers \\./\\./ And let’s not forget the very large ( o Y o ) , the very small (.)
