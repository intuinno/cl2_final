You've gotta LOVE it when you can get into those sexy jeans that your highs use to be to fat for ..!!! :D 
Why am I SO tired ALL the time ?? I'm not even a mom yet ... 
It is SO difficult sometimes to make those delicious hardy meals for your husband and not getting to enjoy them as well , because you always try to eat that healthy stuff ... :/

SO exhausted ... 
In the Boise airport waiting for our flight back to < PROPMALE > ... Crazy weekend we had .. EVERYONE got sick ( In a house with 1 bathroom ) - My oldest brother broke his femur , getting bucked off his horse - Driving back and forth between home and the hospital - Lots of rambunctious little ones .. But , despite all the stress and sickness ~ I LOVED coming home to see my amazing family and friends again !!! <3 
Just got home from her Thanksgiving adventures ! Now it's time for laundry ... yay ... ;P 
Is SO grateful for life's unexpected blessings ... It's so wonderful to me how things always have a way of working out for the best , even though it's not the result we may have been looking for .. 
Hmmm ... What should I make for dinner ~ Fajitas or tacos ? 
LOVES being sore after a work out !! :) 
I HATE that it gets dark so early !!! At 6pm I feel like the day is over ... 
There's been beautiful , powdery snow on the ground for 2 weeks ~ I LOVE Christmas in Colorado !!! ( .. even though I HATE driving in it ! ) 
Trying to figure out a way to convince my husband to < PROPFEMALE > Christmas lights in 2 degree weather with ice and snow ... He's not too enthused , to say the least !! 
I don't understand why I'm SO tired ... 
Just got back from the Company Christmas party ... We had a great time ! The food was wonderful and the gift exchange was fun . Except we were a little disappointed with the outcome of it ... 
I LOVE the Holidays ! 
Going on a run is SO good for clearing your head !! 
LOVING the good weather ~ perfect for Christmas shopping !! Then .. AFTER I'm done it can snow again ! Cause I want snow on Christmas !!! 
Just got back from Chili's ~ I LOVE those Southwestern Egg Rolls !! 
I want someone to go shopping with me ... :( 
I don't know what to get my Mama for Christmas !! And she won't tell me what she wants ... ;( 
Let's see how forthcoming my FB friends are . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me . It can only be 1 word . No more than 1 word . Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This should be interesting ... Merry Christmas !! 
I'm SO excited about having a white Christmas here in Colorado Springs this year !! I just hope that my Mother's flight doesn't get canceled this afternoon ... Doesn't the snow realize that it wasn't supposed to come down until AFTER she got here safe and sound ?!?!?

<3 Extraordinarily grateful , for how unconditionally loving and supportive my husband is ... I truly have no idea what I would ever do without that great man ... <3<3 
I never really realized how truly fragile live was ... 
Wish I could fall asleep ... 
Headed home tonight !!! I can't wait to see my Mama and all the family and friends !! And this time I get to stay for almost 3 weeks ~ YAY !!! 
Feeling truly blessed ... <3 
? Celebrate Valentines Day ?, Change your Profile Picture to you and your spouse . <3 
Already miss him ... <3 
Getting homesick ... Is it normal to feel like you have two different homes ? When I'm in Colorado Springs I miss Nampa ~ I miss my family , my friends , the home I grew up in and the atmosphere .. And when I'm here in Nampa I miss the Springs ~ I miss my new family , my puppies , my beautiful home and most of all my wonderful husband !! I think they just need to be closer together , like Boise and Meridian !! ( If only ~ haha ) 
Lonely Saturdays REALLY stink ... 
Feeling sleepy already and it's only 8pm !! What the heck ...?! I shouldn't be tired like this anymore ...! : / 
So grateful he's patient with me ... Heaven knows , I need it ! <3 
Goodbye little Triston ... We'll all miss you SO much ! You taught our family more than you'll ever know during the short time we were blessed with you . We love you ~ and can't wait until we can see you again . <3 
I'm SO happy to be home ~ after a bittersweet three weeks ... But I'm missing my Mama already !! 
Sometimes I really wish < PROPMALE > didn't have to teach class 3 nights a week ... I hate not having him around in the evenings ! But hey , at least the other 4 evenings of the week he gets to be home right ?! ( just trying to stay positive ! ) 
Anybody out there have a family member they secretly wish they weren't related to ?? Or is it just me ? 
<3 
I LoVe Sundays !! It's great to spend so much time with the people you love most !! : ) 
\A woman has to work twice as hard as a man to be thought of as half as good ... luckily this isn't difficult . \ " ; ) " 
I love waking up early and going for a run !! <3 It's going to be beautiful today !! 
<3 I Love bedtime ... best time of every day ! 
Cheesecake Factory , in < PROPMALE > , for dinner !! ; ] 
Yesterday I became an Aunt for the 13th time !! My brother < PROPFIRST > & his beautiful wife < PROPFEMALE > had their 2nd little boy at 12:50 pm yesterday ! His name is < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . He weighed in at 8 lbs 10 oz & is 21 1/2 inches long . And apparently , he's the spitting image of my brother ~ lots of blonde curly hair , long blonde eye lashes & big blue eyes !! And , of course , little < PROPMALE > is SO excited to be a big brother !! :D 
I'm so energized by the GORGEOUS weather today !! And even though the time change is always annoying at first ~ I LOVE that the sun is shining later into the evening , now !! 
Well ... Found out I'm Hypoglycemic ... So that explains why I've been so tired and have had so many headaches the past few months . 
Gorgeous weather yesterday ~ A foot of snow today ... Well , that's Colorado for you ... 
Can't WAIT ' til summer ... This girl desperately needs her tan back !!! 
I truly HATE Obama !!!!!! This Health Care < PROPMALE > is CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That man is the BIGGEST mistake < PROPFEMALE > ever made !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Hopes she's found the motivation ...!! 
I absolutely LOVE my brothers ... They are the best guys a little sister could ask for !! 
<3 I LOVE sunshine !!! <3 
Homemade Chili for dinner anyone ?!? 
It's whiteout conditions here in the Springs ... I'm missing home !! : /

Remodel !! 
<3<3<3 
<3 Thank you SO much , you guys , for all the wonderful Birthday wishes !!! You're all so sweet and thoughtful !!! ;D 
I hate having those days when you don't have any motivation !! ; / 
DANG IT ~ I think I'm getting sick ... AGAIN !!! I sure hope I can get over this soon !! ; ( 
Well ... woke up to a blizzard this morning ... I don't think the weather man here in Colorado knows it's APRIL !!! ; / 
~ How do you let a large group of people know you don't like something that they're doing ?? ~ Especially after you've already tried and they just kind of laugh and blow you off ...? I NEED HELP ... I think people don't take me seriously because I'm too nice ! I'm always afraid of offending someone ... 
Just realized I COMPLETELY FORGOT about something I was supposed to do over 9 months ago , as part of my wedding plans ... I feel HORRIBLE !!! 
I'm actually REALLY excited to complete my to-do list today !!! 
11 am - sunshine ... 11:10 am - blizzard . Colorado weather leaves you feeling a little dizzy sometimes ... 
It's just a little TOO ironic that after one of the coldest winters this country has seen in a few years , they're now calling it , \Global Climate Change\ " instead of \ " Global Warming \"..." 
Feels like I broke my back ... 
Excited to head to DC for business and then < PROPMALE > to visit my big brother < PROPFIRST > and his beautiful wife and little boys !! I'm going to miss my babies SO much while I'm gone ... 
Gotta love that T-Pain once in a while !! 
I'm SO grateful he's my BEST friend !! <3 
Trying to discover some way that I might make a difference ... You always see these people that have such a positive impact ... I'm not sure if I have a strong enough character to be as selfless and serving as them ~ I just truly hope I do ... 
Congratulations to my little sister ~ she got engaged !!! 
I'm officialy OLD now ... I just told my husband to go yell at some kids to get them off our lawn . 
I am so sick of this ... I can never say or do anything right . No matter how hard o try I'll NEVER be good enough . 
I wanna live back home . 
I'm sorry ... But it's really gross to me when you see those girls that entirely wax or shave off their eyebrows and then draw them back on their face ! It always turns out 1 of 2 ways - They'll end up with these < PROPFEMALE > little penciled in lines that you can barely see .. OR they'll have these things that , from a distance , look like massive pieces of black licorice that stretch from one side of their face to the other !! 
Have a question ... When you start a blog , can you ever change the name of it later ?? 
FINALLY settled in at our suite in < PROPFEMALE > ! It's so nice here ! :) 
Yep I've decided ... I HATE humidity ! ... And lower altitudes than the Rockies . I feel so sluggish and my mind always feels clouded ! Blah ! 
I miss riding my horse and I want to go shooting with my brothers !... I think this means I need to plan a trip home !! 
Sometimes that man just amazes me ... I truly don't know what I would ever do without him ! ? 
BBQ chicken with fried potatoes and onions for dinner anyone ?! : ) 
Absolutely love researching family history !! 
... Migraine ... ; [ 
Some people have a very skewed definition of the meaning of Family ... 
I miss my babies SO much !!!! 
Angels On the < PROPFEMALE > ... 
My poor guy ... He's got kidney stones AGAIN !! ; ( 
Truly grateful for my wonderful family !! 
< PROPFEMALE > is beautiful !! 
I'm absolutely addicted to Thriving < PROPFIRST > !! ; ] 
~ * ~ I am so grateful that when I was privileged to fall in love it was unmistakably , absolutely and irrevocably with Him ... <3 ~ * ~ 
D.C. < PROPFEMALE > was BEAUTIFUL !!! ; ] 
~ * ~ I LOVE little girls !! I met a little girl yesterday who had to tell me ALL about herself ~ Her name ( < PROPFEMALE > ) , how old she was ( 4 & 1 half ! ) , when her birthday was , how much fun she was having while shopping at the White Flint Mall with her daddy , ( I felt sorry for him . It looked like she'd warn him out ! Haha ) etc ... She was ADORABLE !! I want one !!! ; ] 
** Amazing day !!! ; ) 
Do you ever get that felling everyone is avoiding you ? : / 
At least I get to spend the day at the Baltimore Aquarium with my man ! 
HAHAHA ... Love it !!! ;D 
Can't wait to visit my brother < PROPFIRST > in < PROPMALE > on Friday !! < PROPFEMALE>'s been fun , but I'm ready to see family !! ; ] 
;D 
I love them ! ; ) 
? I LOVE summertime !! And I love that that means spending more daylight hours with my Man !! It gives us a < PROPMALE > to spend active time together , work on outdoor projects , get exercise , enjoy the fresh air and make our lawn beautiful !! We have SO much fun together !! ? 
Just breath ..... JUST breath ..... 
* Sigh * Been a long day ... 
Can't find the words ... FRUSTRATION maybe one ... sadness and anger maybe be others ... 
Well , I'm going to be here for at least the next five years ( wether I want to be or NOT .. ) ... And I could desperately use some good friends , because I'm SO tired of feeling like I don't belong !! So I've decided I'll just need to go look for them ( not quite sure how to do that but I've got to try) ! I just NEED to be around people that I understand !!! 
They're the best !! ;P 
Hate feeling sick !! Blah ! ; / 
BEAUTIFUL < PROPFEMALE > Sunday !! B ) 
** BLT's , in the summer time , are the BEST !!! : ) 
~ * ~ Happy Birthday to my beautiful Mother ... Truly the most remarkable woman in this world !! I hope one day I may be blessed with her goodness and strength !! I love you Mama !! <3 ~ * ~ 
We've finally decided !!! And we're both SO thrilled ...!!! : ] 
* California gurls ~ we're unforgetable !! * 
Great ... It's happening again ... Well , there's no way of getting around it . So ~ Bring it on !! 
** Making a BLOG of our little family !! I just want to make sure that I keep thing documented so that we can look back and remember all those little things that you'd usually forget ! And hopefully our family and friends will enjoy seeing what we're up to , since we're so far apart ! :) 
Sometimes I just want to crawl under a rock to pray that some of life's trials will just go away ~ and then stay there until they do ... Too bad it doesn't work like that . : / In which case , I'm SO eternally grateful to have such a remarkable man by my side ! <3 
? Heaven help me ~ I just can't help but love that Man more than life itself !! ( And don't tell him ... But I absolutely love the dorky little things he does to make me laugh ! ; ) Haha ? 
** What COLORs should I paint in my house ?!?!? I have been ripping my hair out over this question !! PLEASE , help me !!! If anyone out there is an Interior Designer ~ I will PAY to fly you to my house , for a few days , so you can help me !!! ** 
I love Sundays ... A peaceful , relaxing , weekend was EXACTLY what I needed ! It was a really rough week ... 
So thankful ... <3 
I really want to stop hurting !!! 
Chicken Fried Steak for dinner anyone ?! I'm not sure if < PROPMALE>'s in the mood for it , but it sounds pretty yummy to me !! =) 
* My little sister will be here on the 6th ~ SO EXCITED !!! * 
Exhausted ... yet hyper !! That's such a funky feeling ... =) 
Never thought that trying to replace the locket I lost would be so difficult ... : / 
I share a hate-hate relationship with my husband's company ...!! 
Keeping my fingers crossed !! =) 
One of my greatest pet peeves ~ ~ People that are SELFISH and LAZY ... especially when people that they ( supposedly ) love and care for could really use their help !! Those people I will NEVER understand ( Sadly I know a few ... ) !! 
\Through strength I found love ... In time I found myself in happiness with you ... \"" 
Oh geez ...! LOL 
Nothin better than BBQ chicken and a big green salad during the summer !! =) 
Fell like relaxing and watching a movie after a long day of cleaning , organizing and working out ... What should I watch ?? : ) 
Making raspberry and blackberry freezer jam !!! =) 
** Today I bought 6 flats of raspberries & 2 flats of blackberries ~ each containing 12 cartons ... Each carton usually costs $5.99 . So when they rang me up the total can out to $621.04 ( plus tax ) * BUT * ... There was a special going on if you had your store club card ~ 10 for $10 !! When I swiped that card the total went down to $103.68 ~ leaving me with a total savings of $517.36 !!! HECK YEAH !!! =D 
This very cold and lonely little lady is ready for some sleep !! ( ... Why did work have to send him to California for so long anyways ?!! :/ ) It's been a long day . : ( 
Just got done with a great run !! Perfect way to start the day !! =) 
Decided to go running again ~ I just can't get enough of it !!! Not sure why ... Haha ! =) 
I am SO grateful for Mr. Exterminator !!!!!! I just might sleep at Mom's tonight ... 
I'm SO done with this ... 
Ready for bed again ...!! : / 
Taco salads are DELICIOUS !!! =) 
I have an AMAZING Husband ! He does anything & everything he can to help me ! He's NEVER harsh or mean ~ He's ALWAYS gentle , loving & thoughtful ! He's so compassionate & understanding ! And he's full of patients ! I swear , his only flaw is that he's always so hard on himself . I hear women complain about their men sometimes & I never know what to say ~ B/c I just can't relate to them . I truly am INCREDIBLY lucky !!! <3 
I am absolutely LOVING the color * pink * lately !!! And I never really did before ... Is that just a sign the I want a baby girl ?!? ( lol =) 
I love having people over for a steak dinner !! It's just lots of fun ! And grilling the steaks keeps my husband busy so he's not buggin me in the kitchen !! ( hehe ) ; ) 
Darlin ' that is a FORK not a FORKLIFT ~ SLOW DOWN !!! Geeeeez ... 
I want someone to chill with today ! ~ With < PROPMALE > in California it's been pretty dull lately ... Where's a plane to Idaho when you need it ?? Haha ;P 
Bubblicious Bubble Gum is the BEST !!! =) 
Why does it have to make me cry when a spider gets close to me ??? 
I am FREEZING !!! 
I hate it , when just the THOUGHT of a certain person makes you feel uneasy , angry , overwhelmed and annoyed ... It makes me feel like I'm gonna be sick ... Why does she affect me SO much ??? 
Out of all the days of the week - Why does it ALWAYS have to storm on Saturday ?? 
Off to pick him up at the airport !! YAY !!!! =D 
Just feelin ' really icky ... 
Beautiful grilled steaks , roasted potatoes , corn on the cob and homemade biscuits + Eating outside with your favorite person in the warm sun and a nice breeze = A FABULOUS summer evening !! =) 
My poor Man has to go in for surgery first thing in the morning ... We're SO nervous ... 
Waiting at the hospital ... Praying the surgery goes well . This is the last < PROPMALE > his arm has ... 
I don't need a maid ~ I just want someone to fold my laundry and keep my kitchen clean ! ... Wait I just need my Mama to come visit , permanently !! =P 
Well , I made it through the day and only cried once ! I'm SO glad that surgery is over !!... But now the knowledge that it's only the beginning of a long road , is seeping in ... Cause it's back to the surgeon tomorrow and then on to the physical therapist ... =/ ( Can you say , \More pain meds ~ Please !?! \ " ) " 
I'm EXHAUSTED ... But I better get up and start workin ' on the Potatoe Salad . =/ 
Hair cutting time ! =) 
Why do some people make me want to scream ... 
... I wanna go to bed ... It's 10pm somewhere right ?? ( I REALLY need this day to be over !! ) =/ 
SUCH a fun day with my niece !! =] 
You know ... It's not just me ! If only you knew how hard it was for everyone to deal with you !!! 
Just got back from the Renaissance Festival ~ SO much fun !!! Had my palm read ... Surprisingly VERY accurate ! We all had such a BLAST !!! =D 
Facebook wars get really old ... 
Sometimes I REALLY regret ever trying to help others or getting involved ... EVERYtime I reach out it ends up biting me in the butt !!! I'm finding it SO hard to trust people and believe them to be sincere anymore .. And I really hate when people try to be so overly considerate that they come across as distant , untrusting and rude !!! =/ 
I want a family ... 
Emm and I made a delicious Pretzel Salad that turned out PERFECTLY !! And now it's time to finish up on our homemade Chicken < PROPMALE > ( this recipe is 10x better then < PROPFEMALE > Garden's , < PROPFIRST > Corinos , etc .. I LOVE it ! ) and cheesy garlic bread !! Yu-umm ! =D 
I don't care if you think I'm crazy ~ Cause I'm not gonna stop bein myself !! =P 
Shopping and sewing ~ it's gonna be a fabulous day !!! =) 
Today was SO much fun !! ~ Even though I have some < PROPMALE > blisters now ... Ha 
Got the dress done and they LOVED it !!! Maybe I should just be a seamstress ... 
One more day .... Can you believe it's been a YEAR ?!! 
Mean what you say ~ And say what you mean !! 
Highs and lows ... 
~?~ HAPPY 1st ANNIVERSARY to my Love and my best Friend !!! <3 The day we got married I never felt nervous ~ And today I still feel that same beautiful peace in knowing I made the best decision of my life ! <3 I LOVE you Sweetheart ~ Forever and Always !!! ~?~ 
I feel like people only see me as an agressive , criticising bully ... And that's not true ! I'm just a very strong willed person ( and sometimes that trait gets the best of me ) - I call it how I see it and I always try my best to do it in a tactful way ! I don't constantly < PROPFEMALE > over people - When I compliment someone I do it out sincerity , not empty courtesy . 
Today was absolutely beautiful !! B ) 
So how is everybody doing today ?!?! =D 
I'm SO excited that my hair is getting so long !! 
I can't WAIT to get a new phone !!! =D 
Got my new contacts today ... and wow do my eyes need a rest !! 
Can not WAIT to get outa here and be home for a while !!! =D 
Fine ~ then I'll just work harder !!! 
Homemade Chocolate Chunk Cookies ~ Yu-uumm !!! =] 
SO-so much to do and ( as usual ) so little time !!!!!!! 
Great ... Still got about another 5 hours till I can go to bed ... =/ 
Two hours after we started our 10 hr drive home we both came down with a stomach flu ... And that 10 hr drive ended up stretching to over 13 hrs , because of how nauseous we were ... I do not wish to repeat that long day and night again . 
Why does it seem like there are so many people in my life that cause me so much anxiety ?? Why do I let them make me feel this way ... And how do I keep it from happening ? 
I'm out ... 
Just saw a transvestite wearing a shirt that said \GUESS\ " ... LOL !!! " 
Seriously ..?! It's like I don't even exist !! =/ 
I am absolutely EXHAUSTED ... mentally , emotionally and physically ... I don't want another day like these past few EVER again !! 
Sat down to the piano today for first time in over a year .. I have a performance coming up in 3 weeks that I got signed up for .. Haha . But I have to admit ~ It felt so good to play those keys and sing like that again !! ? 
Feel like a failure ... 
I'm just sayin ' ... 
Officially feel OLD ..! Pulled into my driveway and told 3 kids to get out of my yard ! Wow .. Hahahaha ~ Wasn't that long ago I was on the receiving end of a comment like that .. ha 
Apparently I'm not worth it ... 
Never want to spend another night in a hospital again ... EVER .. 
Don't you just looovve it when you get to prove rude and selfrighteous people wrong ! Oh I do !! I know I probably shouldn't .. but maaann do I enjoy seeing the expression of stunned humility that wipes across their face !! < PROPFEMALE > ... Hahahaha =)) 
Ugh . It still hits me really hard sometimes .. I'm not sure if the pain will ever truly go away . Thank heavens for Mamas though .. cause I really needed a shoulder to cry on this morning .. <3 
I'm < PROPFEMALE > grateful to have this man in my life ! <3 
Everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat ! Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! 
Pressure makes diamonds .... 
I am sooo grateful for the blessings in my life ! I caught myself thinking today about how this or that could be better ... but the truth is ~ things could always be worse . So be grateful for what you DO have . Life isn't about keeping up with the Jones . It's about doing the best you can ! <3 
Writing a letter to my Dad ... Not quite sure how I feel about this decision yet , but for some reason , I just know that I should ... 
Well ... I have a little announcement to make ~ and I think it's about time I shared it with everyone !! ** I AM ....... PREGNANT !!! ** 
These pregnancy headaches are killing me !! ugh ... 
I love the smell of rain .. It always seems so calming . 
Is it just me or does anyone else get a little annoyed by the term , PREGO ?? ... Yes , I'm pregnant , but that doesn't mean I have a can of spaghetti sauce in my stomach . Ha 
First doctors appt . with my new OB GYN this morning ... Hoping this one doesn't disappoint me like those others have . 
This little man loves music ! 
Wish I could just have a good day ...
