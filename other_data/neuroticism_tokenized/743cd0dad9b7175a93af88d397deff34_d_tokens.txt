Sometimes I feel like the fate is mocking me . 

I really should be doing something constructive right now . -_- 
It's weird . When I'm social , I'm happy , but I can't draw/write to save my life . When I avoid everyone , I'm pretty depressed , and I come up with some AMAZING works of < PROPMALE > . Huh . 
IDK . MY BFF < PROPFEMALE > ??? 
I wish everyone had a quick , sarcastic wit . I love to banter . 
I'm so ADD-with-insomnia right now it's not even funny . 
I FINALLY FINISHED THE SETO/JOU PIC I'VE BEEN PROCRASTINATING FOREVER , NOW . 
And there really needs to be more hours in the day , 24 isn't enough . I'm going to start a protest , so Obama will fix this problem . 
Wow . I really need to back off . 
I'm off to my 13 hour long job shadow at the fire station ; I'm both nervous and excited ! =D 
Alright ; I'm turning my phone off and I won't be online for a couple days . 
Up and running again ! I got 2 pictures done , and quite a bit of writing . I'm very proud of myself . =D 
Sometimes I feel like people need more from me than I can give . 
YUGI : Oh my gosh , we're in trouble ! What're we gonna do ? \ 
\ 
YAMI : I'm going to DO MY LAUNDRY ! Could I have some change ? 
Seriously ; Do I give off ' straight ' vibes , or something ? I'm getting sick of this . 
I killed 2 Woodlouse Spiders tonight ; they scared the hell out of me cause I thought they were poisonus , and thus spent hours scouring the internet to find out what they were . Turns out they give painful bites , that itch really bad afterwards . That explains my foot . 
Goddamn ; I REALLY hate spiders !! 
I'm not a narcissist , I swear . 
\It's so beautiful here 
I wish the weather here was always this beautiful . It's like the perfect day . 
I hate waking up with a headache . It pretty much means the day will be extremely unproductive . 
Don't taint this ground , with the color of the past . Are the sounds in bloom with you ? Cause you seem like and Orchard of Mines . Just take one step at a time ... 
I'm falling in love with \Rizzoli & Isles\ " . Such amazing chemistry and subtext between those two women . =] " 
\Let me tell you this : if you meet a loner 
I find it insulting that someone thinks I party too much , given the fact that I NEVER party . I don't smoke , drink , or abuse drugs ; I'm straight edge , and saying otherwise is extremely offensive to me . 
Interesting ... I rank right between INTP , and INTJ . P = 51% , and J = 49% . Very close . 
Yesterday , upon the stair , \ 
I saw a man who wasn't there . \ 
He wasn't there again today . \ 
I wish , I wish he'd go away ... 
\You see this ? Huh ?! N-Y-P-D !! Means I will \ " Nock Yo ' Punk-ass Down !!! \"\"." 
SRSLY . If Izaya and L got gayed with each other and had a kid , I would be that kid . 4SRS . L + Izaya = Me . 
.... WTF ? I typed in \Light Yagami Dammit\ " into google .... and a picture of Hitler popped up . xDD " 
SO . My phone will be off for the next week , or so , until I can get my < PROPMALE > paid . T_T 
How nice ..... tornado sirens are going off . 
My new-found obsession with DRRR seems to have reached a limit . I've read all the worth-while fanfic's on FFN , AFFN , and LJ . I've also stalked youtube . And downloaded a crap load of doujinshi from aarinfantasy . I think I may need rehab . 
Severe thunderstorm on the way ~ ! <3 <3 <3 
I feel accomplished . Today , I did a 3 1/2 hour long modeling photo-shoot ; I got myself an interview at Flowerama set for Monday ; and I completed the pencil-work for a new picture . 
I'm gonna go draw some more . Bye-bye ~ ! 
Okay . Seriously ? At 9pm I sat down with my tablet , intent on getting some drawing done . Next thing I know , my hand is so stiff and cramped up I can barely move it ( freaking painful typing right now ) , so I'm forced to stop . When I look at the clock , it's almost 4:30 am . \ 
I've been drawing non-stop for 7 1/2 hours , without realizing it . Wow ........ 
Wow . Haha . Somebody just sent me hate mail telling me to kill myself , along with friends and family . I have no idea who this \Shavonda Watson\ " is ; and her grammar mirrored that of a 5-year-old . Her death threats made me laugh my ass off . xDDDDD " 
Getting ready to leave to my interview at Flowerama soon . I'm nervous . ^_^ ;; 
Yay ! My interview went very well . I'll know by the end of the week whether I got the job or not . <3 <3 <3 
I feel really depressed today , for some reason .... Hm . 
OMG . I just download SAI Paint tool ............ it's sooooooooo much better than Photoshop CS4 . I'm in love .... <3 <3 <3 
OMG . Seriously , I wanna go to the New York Comicon , JUST so I can see the Durarara panel . 4SRS 
I'm beginning to develop an intense attraction to FtM transgender's , or Butch's in general ... I feel like I'm becoming more and more Femme . 
Goddammit , I'm really down . I didn't get the job at Flowerama .... evidently I lack experience , despite the fact that I spent 3 years in customer service . I really hate getting my hopes up . 
I'M SO FRUSTRATEDDDD !!!! * cries * T^T 
HA . HAHA ..... MY TABLET PEN JUST BROKE . >=[ 
I feel like I have a fever .... * Goes to look for thermometer * 
Gravitation in Real Life :\ 
Shuichi : < PROPFEMALE > , WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME ~ ?!?!??!? \ 
Yuki : Shut up , bitch . 
The replacement pen for my tablet should be here by Thursday ...... now , what to name him/her * doesn't know the gender yet * ............ 
Busy , busy , busy - ADD is kicking in . I'll reply to everyone later ~ ! 
Ya know , it used to be that everyone thought I was in my mid-twenties , when I was a teenager . But now that I'm older , everyone seems to think I'm about 15-16 . The older I get , the younger I look ??? O_o ;; 
JUST HAD AN EPIPHANY . TTYL 
Wow ... Izaya does a LOT of walking . According to google , it takes an hour to walk from Shinjuku to Ikebukuro . >> 
MY REPLACEMENT GOLDFISH [ aka : Pen ] HAS COME IN TODAY . The name of which , I've decided to call him \Silver . \ " <3 <3 <3 " 
Hi-ho , Silver .... AWAY ~ !!! * Goes off to draw * 
That episode TOTALLY renewed my faith in Supernatural . I mean , come on . < PROPFIRST > took a level in badass , and CAS IS BACK . <3 <3 <3 
I really love the way that < PROPFIRST > was all pissy ! jealous over Cas and Dean's .... ahem \bond\ " . <3 " 
I must be an extremely social recluse . My Extroversion is only 13% . Apparently only 0.4% of the population is more socially retarded than me . \ 
IGUESSIMUSTBEJUSTLIKELAWLIET . LOLOLOLOL <3 <3 <3 
Will respond to everyone tomorrow ; really tired now - sorry . =[ 
is feeling sick . 
WTH ?? What is with my steadily declining Extroversion ?! First it was 15% , then it was 13% ..... NOW ? It's 11% ..... TAT

I still feel really sick . WTH is this ??

MY PHONE IS TURNED BACK ON ~ !! HALLELUJAH ~ !!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
I feel really ..... raw . ='( \ 
</3 
If I'm not drawing , I'm writing - If I'm not writing , I'm drawing . \ 
Now if only I got paid for it , I'd never be happier . 
is having a REALLY fun time playing Izaya and Aoba . >=3 
really needs to check her ' events/invitations ' more often . Hahaha .... =_=;; 
It's pretty painful for me to admit this ; but honestly ? I'm really very Shy . \ 
>///> 
Haha !! I love Kasuka so much ; that freakin robot . xD\ 
-\ 
\When he got a call on a holiday from a stalker 
is thinking about doing ' 30 Days of Anime ' . 
is re-reading Durarara . Ya know , I don't care is Kasuka acts like an emotionless robot ; he's so sweet and polite in the novels ! ( And is steadily becoming my favorite character ) =O 
WTF . OMG . WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME ?!?!?! TODAY IS FRIDAY . I JUST NOW REALIZED THAT I MISSED SUPERNATURAL . NOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
Dx 
has been trying to get into the head-space for some writing all day . \ 
Now I'm finally there . <3 
I can't decide whether I love , or hate the way that writing and drawing both seem to completely dominate my life . Hmmmm ..... 
< PROPFEMALE > Cuccaro , < PROPFEMALE > Ogle , and < PROPFEMALE > Bergman - you guys have LJ , yessss ??? I just made one today [ lollatefail ] link me to yours . =D

NANOWRIMO STARTS !!!!!! =D 
OKAY .... I came to an epiphany . It's all good . 
taking a break from Nano to write some fanfiction instead ... 
Insomnia + Nanowrimo = fast progress ... but dangerous to your health and sanity . 
is trying to continue writing her horror novel , but FAILING miserably because < PROPFEMALE > Cuccaro made her laugh all night . Can't write horror when you're in a good mood . >=/ 
Why ? Why must Nanowrimo eat my brain ??? It's trying to zombify meeee !!! [ Pfff , which is totally awesome . ] <3 
Nuuuuuuuuuuuu ......... I'm really sleepy . v_v

It's so hard to be angry with someone when they're so upfront and honest with you . Damn ... 
is incredibly frustrated with herself . 
I hate it when I can't stop bleeding . Wtf ... 
Going to bed . I didn't get nearly as much writing done , as I wanted to . [ Started a new story , and updated some segments ] I'll work more tomorrow . 
I should be writing ..... BUT I'M NOT . [ Procrastination : I use it . ] 
Why I love my brother :\ 
< PROPFIRST > Kinnison : \Life is pain . Pass the tissues . Can I borrow your girl pants ? I want to look hardcore while I'm complaining about my suburban lifestyle and cutting myself . \ " \ 
Currently pushing myself out of my comfort zone as a writer ... and I love it . I'm a fast learner , and I'm catching on quick to this new type of style . 
I'm about to start crying . < PROPMALE > Smith's cover of ' Hey < PROPFIRST>' .... GOD . My favorite artist mixed with one of my favorite songs .... T____T 
Trying to write . The words aren't coming . Dammit . 
< PROPFEMALE > Cuccaro IS NOT LONGER MY BROHAMA OR BROSKILLET . SHE BE A BROSLUT/ BROSNAKE . 
< PROPFEMALE > Cuccaro ITS YOUR BROSPONSIBILITY TO GIVE ME A BROSNACK AND TREAT ME WITH BROSPECT .

I'll be leaving to Kentucky early in the morning ...

I'm 96% Ravenclaw . I was expecting it - but not THAT high of a percentage score . xD 
< PROPFIRST > Cook , I can't wait ' till this weekend . <3 
is watching House , instead of writing . xD 
Not being able to sleep sucks . I always lay there for hours and hours and hours . The only times I can sleep consecutively are when are stay up for days at a time , and I'm too exhausted to do anything else . 
I REALLY want to get a ' Led Zeppelin World Tour 1971 ' t-shirt . <3 
I love that she is my equal in creativity and intelligence . <3 
Seriously , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is 62 and yet he's STILL so pretty !!!! * q *

It's 5:40 am and I'm watching Rugrats while I drink hot cocoa . xD 
is currently re-watching ' The Brave Little Toaster ' . THIS MOVIE IS SO FUCKED UP . OMG . 
After taking many different tests , I've officially come out as being an INFP - aka : \The Idealist\ " . <3 " 
I can't get over the fact that Izaya actually answered a phone like : \Sushi loooove ~ ! Especially Fatty Tuna ~!\" ............... he sounded like a rapist . O_o " 
This is an update . I have absolutely nothing to say . =/ 
.... Seriously . Where is my phone ?? =/ 
Oh - I found my phone ! It was hiding in my bed . xD 
My hands and feet are like ice . I swear , I can't seem to retain body heat worth shit . >=[ 
I really love mornings . <3 
My phone is fully active again , after 2 months . xD 
Wow , I take a day off from writing , and it feels like I'm going through withdrawal . I think that must be called \dedication\ " . xD " 
Ughhhhh . I don't even know . 
................. * Sigh * 
Seriously , man . Writer's block ? SO NOT COOL . >=( 
I kind of ... don't feel like Cosplaying anymore . I don't feel much into anime , either . I've been all video games and comics these past few months . 
Anxiety . Never a fun thing to experience for an extended period of time . =/ 
Just . I don't know . I really , really don't . 
Yeah , my phone is currently deactivated , fyi . =/ 
I FAIL . SO . HARD , DUDE . I SERIOUSLY FAIL . 
Zombies !!! I love them so ~ <3 
I came to the realization that I'm actually a Geek , and not an Otaku . I love comic books ! I love science fiction ! I love puzzle games , zombies and old school Nintendo . ^_^ 
is currently with her surrogate family . I love them all so much . <3 
Such a calm day . All I feel like doing is curling up with a book and some coffee . <3 
I just got home and I miss them all already . ;_; 
... I really don't like the < PROPFEMALE > . I really , really don't . 
Man , seriously . I thought I would grow out of it , yet , here I am , still extremely confused . What the hell ?

TUMBLR . WHY ? WHY DO THIS TO ME ? I JUST WANTED TO LOOK AT ONE < PROPFEMALE > . NOW THERE ARE 32 OPEN TABS ON MY SCREEN . WHY ? WHHHYYYY ?!
