relaxing from work . 

Chillin on a saturday tired from the week 
When one door closes , another opens ; but we often \ 
look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see \ 
the one that has opened for us . 
Watch your thoughts ; they become words . Watch your words ; they become actions . Watch your actions ; they become habits . Watch your habits ; they become character . Watch your character ; it becomes your < PROPFEMALE > . 
God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I \ 
cannot change , courage to change the things I can , and wisdom to know \ 
the difference . 
MONEY ! POWER ! RESPECT ! 
We come to love not by finding a perfect person , but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly . 
Great minds discuss ideas ; Average minds discuss events ; Small minds discuss people . 
People have the right to be stupid . Some people abuse that privilege . lol 
Always be a first-rate version of yourself , instead of a second-rate version of somebody else . 
Sometimes peoplerun away to be alone , but sometimes theyrun away to seeif you care enough to follow them 
Went to an art/music festival Downtown and had a mad good time . 
You've got to take the good with the bad , smile with\ 
the sad , love what you've got , and remember what you had . Always \ 
forgive , but never forget . Learn from mistakes , but never regret . 
There are two kinds of secrets . Those we keep from others ... And those we hide from ourselves . 
You have to know how to accept rejection and reject acceptance . 
Sometimes people put up walls , not to keep others out , but to see who cares enough to break them down . 
Speak when you are angry , and you will make the best speech you'll ever regret . 
Three R's of Life : Respect others . Respect Yourself . Take responsibility for your actions . 
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams . 
Life's values is to love things that makes life priceless , and not make the love for money your life . 
If two past lovers can remain friends , either they never were in love or they still are . 
Someday someone might come into your life and love \ 
you the way you've always wanted . If your someday was yesterday , learn . \ 
If your someday is tomorrow , hope . If your someday is today , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Many people have ideas on how others should change ; few people have ideas on how they should change . 
Sometimes the best way to be happy is to learn to let go of things you tried hard to hold on to 
Just being yourself , being who you are , is a successful rebellion . 
Live . Love . Learn . Leave a legacy 
We know what we are , but know not what we may be . 
I'm numb my heart turned cold 
Most people are stronger than they know they just forget to believe in it sometimes . 
ALL THE NONSENSE IMA LET BYGONES BE BYGONES , IM LIVING LIFE THE FULLEST HOPE YALL ON THE SAME THING THAT IM ON , YA DIG 
Base your Hopes on Action , not mare Dreams 
You can't let other people tell you what you are , You have to decide that for yourself . 
The difference between the impossible and possible lies in a person's determination

Look for the girl with the broken smile\ 
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile 
Dinero respeto de energía 
Crazy live insanity a must 
Life Is Good 
Our lives are not determined by what happened to us , \ 
but how we react to what happens , not by what life brings us but by the\ 
attitude we bring to life . A positive attitude causes a chain reaction \ 
of positive thoughts , events , and outcomes . It is a catalyst , a spark \ 
that creates extraordinary results . 
Don't just look , observe .. Don't just swallow , taste .. Don't just sleep , dream .. Don't just think , feel ... Don't just exist , live ... 
People are depressed because they think their \ 
problems are forever . In fact , forever never exists , either in your \ 
happiness or sadness . 
Thank God !!!! I have a welding job at 7 o'clock in the morning . 
People say find good people and leave the bad ones\ 
i think we should find good in people and accept the bad in them . No \ 
one is perfect . 
Well , I say you're my , beginnin my end\ 
You're my sista lover and friend\ 
God is , your light from within\ 
It shines through your beautiful skin\ 
What they , say bout you ain't true\ 
There's no me if there is no you\ 
I hope , that you understand\ 
You got to respect yourself before I can 
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said . 
Change\

see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . * Join the Fight \ 
Against Child Abuse * copy & paste to your status & invite your \ 
friends to do the same ! but don't copy the same pic ... 
The secret of happiness is not doing the things that you like but liking the things that you do . 
At the house creating music ... 
Done with my songs for today 
You must be the change you wish to see in the world . 
I OFFICIAL WELD FOR ALTEC NOW !!!! 
Two options of life : make yourself what the world wants , or make the world what you want . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY FATHER 
Funny how points in your life that you feel so high up that you can hear heaven and at an instant you hit in the deepest point you feel that heaven don't hear you . Have faith and you will overcome and rise above anything .

Solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character . 
Your background it ain't squeaky clean shit\ 
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream\ 
You ain't no saint , we all are sinners\ 
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner ...
