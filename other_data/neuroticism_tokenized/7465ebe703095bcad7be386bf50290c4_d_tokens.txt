Has someone been mocking and sneering at your fervent attempts to improve your life ? When your honorable achievements or virtue are being attacked , it's usually by someone who views them as a mirror of their own inadequacy instead of an inspiration for excellence . Criticism is the death-rattle of a non-achiever . Turn a deaf ear their way , and continue on your journey with faithfulness and purpose .

There comes a time in everyone's life when their dreams are perceived as being unachievable . Sometimes that is because the dreams were unrealistic to begin with . But most often it's because they simply stop dreaming . Because of delay and discouraging forces , abandoning dreams seemed to be an easier path than pursuing them . Your God-given dream is STILL attainable . IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO BE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN . 
“A new cul­ture will be cre­ated by those that aren’t afraid to be insecure” . It's time that we put our insecurities down , relinquish our faults and realize that its time to break out and be Happy , Content , Loving and Stress Free . I am confident you can do it !
