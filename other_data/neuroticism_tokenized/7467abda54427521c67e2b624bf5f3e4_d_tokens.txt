who is it ? when will it be ? when will it happen ? how will we know ? how do u start ? when is the perfect time ? wat will happen ? all so many questions and yet not one answer , until it happens , then ALL the questions will be answered at the same time ..... so i guess the REAL question is ..... WHEN WILL ALL THE QUESTIONS BE ANSWERED ?? 
Either hear the answer I want I guess or until a new question comes up , something else I want to say is that ill always like the QUESTION I asked because if I didn’t get the answer I wanted it at least showed me a different answer that made me think and that’s why ill always like THAT QUESTION thank you 
the answer to the question has been answered and the answer isnt always wat u want it to be , trust me i know that , but ill tell u wat the answer of the question has opened my eyes , it showed me PASSION for GOD , even though i wanted the other this answered said that it just mot be right now for that certain question to be answered on how i want it to be , but ill tell u wat , im going to still ask that question until i 
read the top first then the bottom
