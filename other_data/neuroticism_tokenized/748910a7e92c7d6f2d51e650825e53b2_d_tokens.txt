Money 

Chillin ' w/ my man ( er .... my best friend < PROPFIRST > ) and our boy < PROPMALE > ( who is f'in awesome ! ) . 
Never trust a liar , or a pillhead or his girlfriend . Fuck them and the pill they rode in on . 
Want to go out for free drinks 2nite . Cuz everybody knows it ain't trickin ' if you got it ... 
< PROPMALE > and I are over & done . Soon I will be on my own . All alone ... 
So happy it's Friday . That means it's MY day . 
I am an orphan ! 
If you can't be good @ least be good @ it ! 
Going to do $1 Dr. Pepper shots at Jackies Place tonight . 
Never run after a bus or a man . There will always be another one . 
I'm high as a kite , I'm puffin ' away , I'll come down in a couple of days ... 
Falling in love is hard on the knees . 
Love me or leave me . 
What do you do when you know what you need but you want something else ? 
My heart is torn in 2 . I need to go home to TX but there are things here in FL I don't want to leave . 
< PROPMALE > is going away for 2 weeks this summer with his grandma to NY . I am totally freaking out because I've never been away from him for more than 2 days ! 
Tonight I'm probably going to sink or swim w/ my best friend . Gonna get crazy . Find mystery bruises all over my legs tomorrow ... 
Totally exhausted . Getting ready to get out of work and tire myself out even more . E's w/ Grandma , so it's party time ! 
Promise ? No I swear ! 
Gearing up for another fantastic weekend w/ my best friend . How can I leave this ?!?! 
What is everyone doing for the 4th ??? 
Sweet dreams are made of this . The most tender kiss . Somethin ' I don't wanna miss . I just can't resist . 
If home is where the heart is , I don't have a home , just a house . 
Relapse may be part of recovery but you can't live your life in a relapse . 
Going to the beach w/ Lizz . Finally gonna see the sun ! 
< PROPFIRST > feeds me too much . I hate gaining weight ! 
It's frustrating not knowing what to do when you are getting what you asked for ... 
Loved the dance . 
So ready for this next week . I have been waiting so long for this ... 
So this is what pure bliss feels like ... 
Wow , that was a crazy night ! Wish I could remember all of it ... 
I think I broke my big toe last night . Anybody remember how ??? 
Just finished watching The Hangover . So funny ! 
If I can't be good , at least I'll be good at it . 
Every day of the week , every hour of the day , every minute of the hour , I am thinking about him 
This is better than a fairytale ! 
Getting ready to go back to work . Ugh ! This mini-vacation was not near enough ... 
Trying to remember last night . It's all a blur ... Did I drunk dial anyone last night ? 
Smile ... It's the second best thing you can do w/ your mouth ! : ) 
I am literally bruised from head to toe ! 
Back to reality ... 
I love the way he looks at me . 
While I struggle to put food in the house , he pours money down his mouth . 
< PROPMALE > left today . I am all cried out ... 
I love how my words can get so twisted on someone else's lips ... 
Packing up my life in boxes . It's a wonder how much you can accumulate in a lifetime ! 
\I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong . I'm movin ' on . \ " Rascal Flatts " 
Everything is packed into the truck . Leaving < PROPFIRST>'s house and headed back to the great state of TX . Missing < PROPFIRST > already ... 
Florida , Alabama , Mississippi down . Now in Louisiana . Next up , Texas ! 
We are now in Texas . San < PROPFIRST > here I come ... 
Safe and sound in San < PROPFIRST > 
Good morning all ! Getting ready to register < PROPMALE > for school in San < PROPFIRST > . Then maybe I'll finally shave my head and dye it leopard print . What do ya think ? 
At the Afterburner contemplatin ' gettin ' a Kamikazi shot ... 
3 kamikazis and a tito's shot later ... Back at home drinkin ' rum ( Sailor < PROPFIRST>'s ) and coke 
$7.46 for a pack of Newports in San < PROPFIRST > . Ugh ! Looks like I'll be changing brands . ( They were only $5.19 in FL ) 
All of a sudden , I miss everything 
< PROPMALE > had a great 1st day at school . Keeping fingers crossed that it continues . 
My heart is wherever he is . How can I live without my heart ? 
I can make it thru the day if I just pretend to be okay 
The world is spinning . And no , it's not because of alcohol . I have vertigo again . Ugh ! : ( 
< PROPFIRST > and I don't have a song . We have an entire soundtrack ! 
Found a job in my sleep , damn things are easy in San < PROPFIRST > ! 
I just started reading the House of Night series not even a week ago and I'm on book 5 . Can you say compulsive reader ? 
Without him , I don't feel like me . 
< PROPFEMALE > is making stuffed cabbage tomorrow ! Can't wait ... 
Chicken florentine for dinner ... And I helped ! 
Had a good time w/ the fam @ Canyon Lake today . Went to < PROPFEMALE>'s Bakery and cafe last nite . They were featured on Man vs Food for their 3 lb . cinnamon rolls and mammouth sized chicken fried steak . It was awesome ! 
Gearing up for a weekend of camping at Canyon Lake with the fam ! 
Went shopping and for lunch with < PROPFEMALE > . Now headed to orientation for my new job ... 
Orientation was a big waste of time , but at least I looked cute in my new clothes ( thanx < PROPFEMALE >!) . Went to the Afterburner for a one and done and now home to relax for the night . 
I'm not super superstitious , but this year October has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is money bags . So Copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one ... who ... does not copy , will be without money . I cannot let that person be me . Good luck- im not taking any chances 
Happy Halloween everybody ! Had fun taking my little Super < PROPFIRST > trick or treating tonight . 
Woke up this morning and my throat was on fire . Then tonight < PROPFIRST > saw a commercial for peppermint chocolate milkshakes from Chick-fil-A and suddenly the pain is not so bad ! LOL 
Thank you Nyquil for finally letting me breathe again . Gonna curl up and read Eclipse another time . :) 
Finished reading Eclipse again . 
I wish heaven had a phone so I could talk to you again . I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday and days before that too . I think of you in silence . I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Re-post if you have someone in heaven that you miss . ** Miss you Mom ** 
Been up all night . Finally got a < PROPMALE > to watch Sunday's episode of < PROPMALE > . Definitely the best one this season , I was on the edge of my seat almost the whole time ! Next week looks fantastic too . 
Trying to pack last night and found boxes of notes from middle and high school . Wow , can you say blast from the past ?!?! 
Happy Thanksgiving everybody ! 
Lovin ' my new phone ! 
Such a beautiful day ! Went to < PROPFIRST>'s Pass and for a walk on the beach with < PROPFIRST > . 
At my wits end trying to discipline a willful and insolent 10 year old . It's times like these that I really need my mom and question God's wisdom in calling her home . 
Finished reading all 1138 pages of It by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > today . Wondering what to read next ... Any suggestions ? 
Ahhh Thursdays . Day for laughing my ass off to Big Bang Theory and Parks & Recreation . 
I'm very impressed with the Chicago Bulls this year . They did a great job defeating the overhyped Miami Heat tonight .

No better way to start the weekend off right than having chinese food on a Friday night .
