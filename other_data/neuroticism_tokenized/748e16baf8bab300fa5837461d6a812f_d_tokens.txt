Why do you think it is everytime I find someone new to like there is always a but ? Like he's cute , but he doesn't want to do anything with his life or he's smart but he's stuck on his mean ex girlfriend :p 
I know how to f-ck it up , more then I can make it better . Now it's too late to try and change me , I been this way forever .
