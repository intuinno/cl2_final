1\ 
out of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is \ 
instantly a minority , put down , given bad labels , left alone , and so \ 
much else ... all for something they didnt ask for . Many gay teens are \ 
turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them that \ 
life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy/paste \ 
this . Most of you wont , but lets see the 5% of you who will ? 
Waiting for that guy who likes his women just like his metal : Full , with Big Aggression , and Black . <3 
Went to the homecoming dance . I like to shake my hind parts , and grind against hot foreign guys just as much as the next girl . \ 
But I WANTED METAL !!! So , I went outside , and head banged in the parking lot while < PROPMALE > blasted it . \ 
I can honestly say that , even running around , embarrassing people , and dancing with a hot foreign guy ; the headbanging with my friends was the best part of the whole night . <3 
Where has all the love gone ? We're so caught up in our own thing .. \ 
We don't even notice that we're hurting others . \ 
So I ask you again , my friend , Where has all the love gone ?

I can't so it . I love you guys . But they suck . Their running off the fame of their earlier days . Their live shows live more than a little to be desired ; he's not even bloody singing for Christ's sake ! \ 
This is it . I'm making a band . \ 
There's no stopping me now . \ 
~ Pepri - Midnight Sunshine . 
So . Didn't go to Technicolor . Sorta glad I didn't; didn't die like I thought I would . I'll just go out and rave when I'm 18 . :P 
This band has so much intensity , it's simply put ; amazing . On a small stage , the band is made up of six guys , and their equipment , and they still move around like they do .. \ 
And they sound pretty good ; in studio , and from what I can see of their live performances . \ 
It's encouraging . \ 
~ Pepe - Midnight Sunshine 
Dack ; hot enough to steal a lesbian's girlfriend . :P 
Thinking of putting up a ad in the greensheet about needing band members .. 
Hey babe , I swear I'm not Disturbed . You can be My Chemical Romance , and I promise to keep you Avenged Sevenfold . So let's go take A Skylite Drive . 
Not feeling the A game . Hope I'm coming down with something or another ; I don't feel like myself at all . 
The square root of < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is pain . Don't try to square < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . The result is death . 
' Cause I don't love you , like I loved you yesterday .. \ 
~ Pepe , Midnight Sunshine 
So . I was watching a music video from the band NightWish . Andthey have a keyboardist . It was like ... he was getting it harder than anyone else . XD 
Feeling the urge to talk to someone until the wee hours of the morning .. 
Because sometimes , even the strong need to be able to < PROPFEMALE > on someone . 
... Am I mean person ? Yea .. And you love it . <3
