Slightly depressed that Loopt found no buzzy-worthy places within 5 < PROPMALE > of where I am . 
just figured out why twitter's so useful ... and it's not finding out what you're eating for dinner or that you just got you heart broken or that you know some lame lyrics to a random pop song 
Why people think Obama is eloquent is beyond me . His pause-filled cadence is soooo nerve-wracking . 
maybe a case for my phone ain't so bad after all

Am I the only one who thinks \the Situation\ " resembles < PROPMALE > DeAnda ? " 
Not to start some huge debate , but it's amazing to me how Apple's one small hitch with a portion of their iPhone 4's got sooo much news and bad press , yet Android phones of all manufactures and carriers are constantly having \small issues\ " and no one speaks a word about it except online . " 
If you're at all interested in finding out why people do what they do , read \Freakonomics . \""

This morning , I dropped my phone into a bowl of potato soup , and now I can't keep it turned OFF !
