Spirituality is like our breathing , subtle and powerful . We can go all day without realizing that we are doing it , but if we stop , we die . 
Today is Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday . Traditionally , it is the last day for Christians to indulge before the sober weeks of fasting that come with Lent 
Company coming !! Girls are coming to a convention here , then corned beef at our church on Sunday . 
My precious dad and son are coming to spend the weekend with us . We will look at the historical places , go to a fish fry and go through old family photographs ! 
Christianity , if false , is of no importance , and if true , of infinite importance . The only thing it cannot be is moderately important . C.S. < PROPFIRST >
