Hopes everyone had a Happy and SAFE New Year's!!!!!! 

After having a very rough time in school this year , < PROPFEMALE > passed to the ninth grade . Good job < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Got home a little while ago . Still trying to relax . 
I love the summer , but it is so hot right now !!!! 
I hate figuring out my bills for the month . Love it whent they're paid though !! 
What a horrible week ... I watched a man die on the side of the road in front of his wife and son after being run over by a drunk driver . i stopped to help , but he couldn't be helped . It was horrible . Then , we caught shoplifters in the store and on the same 
loves her job , but man , I see every weirdo in town there . Popular place ... lol ... 
had 2 days off and is lovin it . Gotta work one more and will have another one off . 
' s farm won't load on Farmville . Arghhhh !!!! 
OMG !!! My crops are dying on Farmville . Everyone else's is working ... even on my computer . Just can't get mine to load . I can see it from neighbors farms though . WHAT IS UP ??? 
was supposed to be in court all week to testify as a witness ... was continued til the end of Sept . and no one told me . Oh well . A week of nothing to do now . 
is not working right now and has decided to take time off to spend with < PROPFEMALE > for awhile . 
The Farmville Decorations requests does not work !!! Out of the 95 comments that I read , no one could put the gifts on their farms . 
Do not open any video sent from any of your friends that says \amazing video\ " and has a hand holding a video camera that says home video !! It is a virus running all over FB and is coming from a lot of different people . Everyone post this on your wall ! " 
is glad to be back . Starting to feel better after the accident . Thanks to everyone who called , came by , or prayed for me ....... 
went to the Dr. today for my left leg . He said it looks good and should be healed up in about 2 weeks . Now I can try to start walking with a < PROPMALE > . Will still be awhile on my right leg though . Oh well , a little progress ... 
walked using the < PROPMALE > for the first time since the accident Oct . 5 . How nice it was to be vertical again after so long . It's a lot of work since I can't use my right leg at all , but its worth it .............. 
The man who hit us while we were outside the vehicle on Oct . 5th was arrested on Friday at 3:20 p.m. He bonded out that night , but at least he has been charged . His blood alcohol content was approx . 4X over the legal limit . Our attorney should be letting us know what happens next . Since it's his third DUI and he is being charged with felony charges he should be going to prison . 
Mornin ' . I don't know why but I feel like this is going to be a good day and I hope it is for everyone . Getting better with the < PROPMALE > . Today I'm going to go to Wal-mart with < PROPFEMALE > and my neice < PROPFEMALE > . Any trip out is great ..... 
is sooo bored !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
can't stand this period of healing . It's taking to long . I want to get out and live again . Not that I had a very exciting life , but man , this is unbelievable .............. especially when the guy who caused it is out having a great time . I know he's still buying beer everyday and I heard he doesn't really care that his carelessness caused serious injury to people . Of course , this will be his third DUI . 
Today would have been my 20th anniversary ... To my husband < PROPFIRST > , I still miss you and love you . R . I . P ............ 
First , would like to say thanks for the friend requests . I love hearing from all of you and I read everything . During my period of healing I don't have much else to do and it really cheers me up . Second , of course , everyone have a wonderful Christmas and appreciate everything you have . < PROPFEMALE > Cristmas to all and to all a good night !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Had a terrible Dr. appt . Monday . In 4 weeks there has been hardly any healing with the bones in my right leg . If it continues they can do surgery again but chances of healing are not as good and it is possible I could lose my right foot because of it . I go back in 4 weeks to have it looked at again . I hate to sound like this , but MAN , THIS SUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!! 
Happy 2011 to all my FaceBook friends ! Hope your new year is as wonderful as all of you are :-) 
Mornin !!!! Is everyone staying warm ? It's even cold here in FL !!!!!!!!!!! BRRRRRRRRRRR !!!! 
Pink & White .............. 
Put ? this ? on ? your ? status ? if ? you ? know ? someone ? who ? has ? or ? had ? cancer ! ? All I wish for in 2010 is a CURE ! ? Dear God , I pray for the cure of cancer .

Goodnight everyone and have a great Saturday !!!!!!!!! Stay Warm ! 
Had a great dr. s appt . for my left leg today . It's healed and I don't have to see that doctor anymore . Two down , one to go . I'll be with him for awhile though . Everyone have a great night <3 
waiting for the warmer weather . Too bad it's supposed to rain . Another surgery for < PROPMALE > on Monday . Hopefully the last . He's not doing too bad though . Everyone have a great day <3 . 
< PROPMALE>'s off to have another surgery in < PROPMALE > tomorrow . Hope everything gets taken care of this time around with him at least . It would be nice if one of us could return to some sort of \normalcy\ " whatever that is !!!!!!!!!!! " 
Today has been horrible . I try to always stay positive and cheery , but sometimes circumstances make it very hard . I want to go home !!!!! I just need a lot of help in order to accomplish that . I will be spending all my time try figure out a plan to get myself HOME !!!!!!!!!! Let me know if anyone can help . I am desparate . < PROPMALE>'s surgery was Monday . We'll see how this one works . Thanks for everyone keeping up with it . <3 
Nite everyone !!! Hope your birthday was great honey <3 ! I love you . 
Shame on you America : the only country where we have homeless without shelter , children going to bed without eating , elderly going without needed meds , and mentally ill without treatment - yet we have a benefit for the people of Haiti on 12 TV stations . 99% of people won't have the guts to copy and repost this . 
Dr. ' s appt . tomorrow about my right leg . I have a feeling its going to be bad news . Possibility of losing my foot . We'll find out more then . 
Got great news today !!!!!!!!! Dr. did a CT scan and there has been some healing . I will now be given a bone stimulator to help promote the growth of new bone cells , and I can begin to use it . Not bearing weight on it , but getting it ready for that . I will also have a < PROPMALE > boot to wear , but I am so happy . I really thought things weren't going to go so well . Thanks everyone for keeping up <3 . 
Just wants to say hey ! Haven't been on in awhile . Miss everyone <3 
Finally going to court about the man who hit me in October . Meet with the state attorney's on March 3rd , and the criminal trial begins March 29th . He already tried to plea out , but the judge said no . I just can't wait for this all to be over with . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!!!!! Sorry I missed your call . Luv Ya <3 !!!!!!!! 
A true friend doesn't care what you're wearing , if you're home is tidy or not , if you're car is making funny noises , that you only have $5 in the bank this week , or that you and you're loved ones aren't perfect and do actually fight ... a true friend just likes you for you ! Repost this if you have at least one true friend ......! 
Met with the State Attorney on Wed . Also saw the officer from the accident and photos of the accident scene for the first time . WOW !!! Trial should be starting soon . Depends on whether the guy wants to fight the charges . We'll see . Everyone check out the picture of < PROPFEMALE > I posted and let me know what ya think . 
Thanks for help expanding my chicken coop everyone ! 
For anyone who is interested , this is a link that has a news clip from my accident . I couldn't find it , but thanks to my neice < PROPFEMALE > , I have now seen it ..... http://www.wftv.com/news/21202501/detail.html 
Crappy news from the dr. The bones are still not healing . I have 6 weeks of trying what I've been doing then , if it's still not healing , they are talking about a bone graft . MAN !!!! I DON'T WANT MORE SURGERY !!! What a mess that accident made of those bones . I couldn't believe it . I saw x-rays for the first time today .

Off to watch Wrestlemania 26 !!! Been waitin all week ! 
Goodbye < PROPFIRST > Michaels !!! Thanks for the years of entertainment . You will be missed <3 ! 
Same old stuff as usual , except I did get to spend more time with < PROPFEMALE > this week ( Spring Break ) , but she's leaving for the weekend , so I'm going out ... 
Have a fun , safe weekend everyone ,,,! 
' s next appt . is Monday . The dr. will be deciding what to do now . Since nothing else has worked so far , I think they're looking at doing another surgery . We'll see ! No trial yet for the driver of the other vehicle . I believe he's pleading \not guilty . \"" 
Rescheduled my appointment , will go on Monday instead . 
Hasn't been on in awhile . Been busy with the dr. ' s . Still no healing , so now I had to quit smoking so that they can do another surgery next month . I am totally hating it even though I would love to be smoke-free . The guy who hit me is in rehab where he can smoke all he wants . I wish this could all be over so I could get back to a normal life . Whatever that is .... 
can't think about anything else but wanting a cigarette . Can't wait til I get through this mess ... Not feeling real good about it all right now ! 
For all the kids whose last day of school was yesterday and first day of freedom was today : Have a great summer . Have lots of fun , but most of all , BE SAFE !!! As much as you may not want to , we all want to see you go back to school next year . Luv you all <3 ! 
I finally figured out how to make an album . Check out < PROPFEMALE>'s Graduation ! 
To all my young FaceBook friends : DON'T SMOKE !!! If you smoke , STOP NOW ! You will want to eventually , and it will be easier now ! If you don't smoke , DON'T START ! You won't miss what you never had and you won't ever think you missed out on something later on .

Just found out that the guy who caused my accident last year has finally accepted some sort of plea ,,, don't know what it is yet , but I guess we'll see next week . Doesn't matter , I hear he's still drinking and driving ,,, :( 
Going to court in the morning to see if this guy who caused the accident is going to accept a plea deal that includes prison time . Sure would like for this to be over tomorrow . I need for this to be over ,,, 
Just got back from court ,,, He has until Friday to decide if he wants to take the plea . Eight years in jail , two years house arrest , and five years proabtion . I don't think he can do it . We go back at 1:15 Friday . 
Watched \The Pelican Brief\ " tonight . Pretty good story-line . < PROPFIRST > Grisham does write some good ones I think . " 
SMACDOWN ,,, Went to court today . The guy who caused my accident went to jail for 8 years . 
Time to < PROPFEMALE > with good friends , enjoy good food ,,, great distraction . I need it .

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence !! 
G'nite BabyGirl ,,, I miss you and I can't wait til ya feel better . Luv ya <3 
Watchin \SALT \""

It's been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges .
