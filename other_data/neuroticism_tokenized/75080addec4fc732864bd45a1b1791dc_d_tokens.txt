Sometimes I lay awake at night and think about the weirdest things . Last night I thought about < PROPFIRST > Mouse and < PROPFIRST > Duck . Why is it < PROPFIRST > wears pants and no shirt while < PROPFIRST > wears a top but no pants ? Also , how is it that < PROPFIRST>'s best friend Goofy is a talking dog that wears clothes and stands upright , while < PROPFIRST > also has a pet dog that strolls around naked and only barks . 
So a friend of mine told me I should write something profound on my FB < PROPFEMALE > everyday . It hurts my head to think of what to say . \

Okay : I confess that I have been spread quicker than peanut butter and by just about as many people who use Jiff and I am not the least bit ashamed . Although a little dab of jelly might have made the rides a < PROPMALE > less bumpy and a bit more tasty . 
I just read that < PROPMALE > Comics is introducing a new character named < PROPFIRST > Keller , who is openly gay . Finally , Jughead has a < PROPMALE > to get tea-bagged !
