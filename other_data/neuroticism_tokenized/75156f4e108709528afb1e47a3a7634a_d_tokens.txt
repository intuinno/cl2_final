Shame on you America : the only country where we have homeless without shelter , children going to bed without eating , elderly going without needed meds , and mentally ill without treatment - yet we have a benefit for the people of Haiti on 12 TV stations . 99% of people won't have the guts to copy and paste .

Seen on Craigslist for Southern MD : Free Snow ( Calvert County ) - Lots of free snow !!!! It can be all yours just come and pick it up anytime you want ! 
Playing with my new toy on a snowy day ... Got an LG BD390 Blu < PROPFIRST > player . Finally got the DLNA streaming working with my MacBook ( using EyeConnect ) so I can now stream movies , pictures , and music from my laptop to my HD-ILA TV and my Onkyo 7.1 1000W surround system . Sweet ! And yes , I am a geek ... 
Are you ready for some football ?!!! Go Saints .... :) 
Here's hoping there's no wardrobe malfunction this year ...

Ok , I finally got a Wii and am totally addicted to the Wii Sports that came with it ( bowling rocks ) ... Anyone else out there with one that can recommend some games that don't suck ? 
Ok , Dart Rage for the Wii gets my stamp of approval ... Addictive , feels like real darts , can't stop playing it . So far there have been no Wii motes actually thrown at the TV because I don't wear the wrist strap . What can I say , I'm a rebel ... :) 
Take 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 
Just about died laughing the other day at work . There's a BIG stapler meant to do 50-100 sheets together . On the handle was written in black sharpie marker ... FAST & HARD - I had to restrain myself from puting a sticky on it that said \That's what she said ! \"" 
I am NOT down with this sickness ...

Got a new mobo off E-Bay that was supposedly tested working ... Other than the fans and LED's it appears not to be working . And I have tried with known good RAM .

Note to self ... Never write code to interface with any type of hardware - because then it somehow becomes your job to maintain said hardware . PS : Newport Electronics \Omega\ " meters with embedded ethernet controller/web server are motherfucking pieces of shit !!!

Just wanted to thank everyone for the birthday wishes ! You all rock !!! :) 
Why has no one invented a \self-cleaning\ " refidgerator yet ??? " 
A win is a win is a win ! Pretty decent start to the preseason ... Knocking off the Bengals 16 to 7 ... Go Cowboys !!! 
Just lost power at work ... Yippie !!! So much for being productive ...

\September is DOD Suicide Prevention Month\ " \ 
House is clean ( mostly ) , now there ain't nothin to do tomorrow but plant my ass firmly on the couch and watch football all day !!! 
Always interesting how a small conversation can put everything back in perspective . After a VERY disappointing Cowboys loss last night things weren't looking so good today . But then you hear from a friend that they have lost a very dear family member . Football is only a game , < PROPFEMALE > your friends , family , and loved ones while you can - as no one is promised tomorrow . 
One other bit of perspective about the game last night ... Flash back to 1993 , < PROPFIRST > loses to the Redskins 35-16 at RFK in the season opener . Who won the Super Bowl that year ? Oh , right !!! One game does not a season make . 
My eyes .... Aieeeeee !!! Note to self , searching for \Bears Suck\ " was not a good idea ... " 
My Mafia is now providing protection for your farm . You may pay for it with any treasure you find . Failure to comply will result in you swimming with your happy fishes ! Hugs and smiles will get you no where .

I love my mom . I love my dad . If I had kids , I'd love them too . I love most all of you ( but a few bums slipped through the cracks ) . I even love chocolate . I support the cure for everything ( however , stupidity is at the top of the list ) . I think the government is fucked up and we just need to start from scratch and keep them out of our personal lives . I believe in God . 
Come on Cowboys .... Lets see some fire and passion this week ! 
Awoke to the phome ringing at 4am and the alarm clock going off . Tornado warning ... What a way to start the day ! Come on Friday !!!

Wonderful ... The national weather service has issued a statement saying that things could be right for \Nocturnal Tornado\ " activity over night ... Guess I'll be sleeping with the weather channel on tonight ... " 
To all my friends , no matter what party you may be affiliated with if any ... We are all Americans and if you want real change get out and vote this Tuesday ! But more importantly pray about your decision , and pray that the people who get elected will make a change for the better for this country and it's people . There is nothing too big or impossible for God to overcome ! 
< PROPFIRST > Cowboys ... Making even the worst teams in the league look good ! Sigh ...

everything I do have . Repost if GOD has blessed you in any way .

Had a blast seeing Halford & Ozzy tonight . Halford was simply amazing as always and has some great musicians backing him - his voice is still one of the best ! Ozzy was suprisingly good are really seemed to be enjoying himself and the crowd's reaction ! 
Life is good - 5 more years of < PROPMALE > Stern in the mornings on Sirius !!! Sigh of relief ... Been a fan since he started on DC101 in 1981 ! 
MythBusters has officially jumped the shark ... Obama ? Really ?! I'm also thinking the same thing with Ghost Hunters who invited the Real Housewives of Atlanta or some such thing ... What's next ? Twilight meets Stargate Universe ?!!!! 
Trying to get things picked up - but totally lacking motivation ... 
T minus 30 till Tron Legacy in IMAX 3D !!! 
Cowboys beat the Skins ! Eagles beat the Giants ! And this damn cold is almost gone ! It has been a wonderful day ! Now on to see who wins Survivor ... 
You and I wake up in jail together ....... Using only 4 words , what do you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along . 
Ok , how long before the snow pics start rolling in ... About 3 inches here already ... Vikings/Eagles postponed till Tues ... Nice hot coffee & football all day ... Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas ! I sure did ! 
There once was a time when neighbors came together and helped one another . It was not considered a hand out , it was a hand up . Can you believe that once upon a time people would bake a cake for a new neighbor to welcome them to the neighborhood ?! We choose to believe these days are not gone . While baking a cake may not save a community , it goes a long way to inspiring others to take action in a positive way . 
is trying to track down $ 200,000 worth of torsionmeter equiptment that I am no longer in charge of or have any control of - yet somehow still remains on my inventory . \ 
Also , if anyone knows of a RELIABLE network controlled powerstrip/ups in the under $200 range - hit me up !

Goo Goo Dolls opening up this year's Pro Bowl ... Cool beans !!! 
< PROPFIRST > Plant was totally awesome last night . Terrific band and some great harmonies as well ... Love the way he's always reinventing the classics as the Zeppelin tunes had a very different flavor to them ! Kind of reminded me of his Honeydrippers stuff - like 50's rock and roll - but not quite . Just a very cool night . The man still has some pipes on him for sure ! 
52 thoroughbred horses need homes . Will go to Sugarcreek this Saturday for slaughter . Gentleman died and his son wants nothing to do with them . Most broodmares are broke and some are in foal weanling , yearlings , 2 yrs and 3 yrs old most are gelded . FREE and papered . Friend of the deceased is trying to find homes 440-463-4288 or 440-463-4288 Barnesville , OH . ( Please copy and paste this on your status ! \) " 
Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ... I think I may be in trouble ! :) \ 
\I'm convinced there are no functional families . Every family has a relative they would prefer to keep hidden . If you think your family doesn't have one ... it's YOU . \"" 
Ok - it's back again ... People saying not to buy gas on a certain day . E-mails saying some companies don't import Middle Eastern oil . First , do you really think that these companies care if you don't buy gas on a single day ? They know if you skip Thursday they'll see you Friday , duh ! Second the mail about not buying from certain companies is false - check Snopes ! 
Finally re-capped the power supply in my DirecTiVo ... Now I can actually use all the outputs ( including S-Video ) without a \Searching for Satellite\ " on the second tuner . Really wish they'd just go ahead and announce the HD DirecTiVo though and I'd happily upgrade . " 
For all those celebrating today , stop for a moment and be thankful and say a prayer for all those in Japan who are having too look harder and harder with each passing hour for a reason to celebrate . 
Does it still count if I crack open a Corona as long as it's with a lime ? :) 
3 minutes into Obama's speech and all I hear over and over is ... \I am so awesome ! \ " Blech ... " 
Ok , can someone help me out ? I'm trying to figure out how ( once NATO takes over in Lybia ) $40 million a day ( in a recession ) so that the entire world can have a clean conscience is a good idea . Also , I loved how \we will not put troops on the ground\ " and \ " America's role will be limited\ " add up to the US still doing the heavy lifting and just using an aerial attack . Way to talk out of the side of your mouth ... "
