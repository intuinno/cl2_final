the perfect tattoo 

i just got done working a 15 hr . day , i feel like i'm crazy , not sure why i'm even doing it anymore . am i running away from something or running towards it ?? Money's damned good though . 
i went to see a doctor today . all i can say is \ 
\ 
Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died . 
Pudding would've made everything all right but instead i got arrested . 
yoga and slushies ... yum 
I went to the beach and spent my day poking sea anenomies . Ha Ha !! ^.^ 
Roller Derby tonight . Hellz yea 
Rollar Derby tonight . Can you dig it ??

Duct tape is like the force . It has a light side , a dark side , and it holds the world together

i smell mushrooms 
going to the store to pick up some whip cream and mashed potatoes 
had one crazy day yesterday . Ketchup/pancake batter filled super soakers made for one hell of a food fight . No better way to wash off the filth than with an epic water fall . In conclusion ... the perfect day 
< PROPFEMALE > and i went on a sad little adventure today ... since when did coloring books become a thing of the past . i feel all old because \back in the day we used to color coloring books on long trips ... \ " how pathetic is it that i alredy have a back in the day phrase ?!!! I need some alcohol to soothe my old soul . " 
This book will change your life . I'm embracing a year of 365 random challanges . Today I insulted a bug and said yo all day .

It was about time for a change .
