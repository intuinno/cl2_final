Writing letters and curling up with a good book . 

Getting ready for Halloween ... 
Tracing my ancestors from the old nation until now . Cherokee Nation Rocks ! 
wow ! I have traced my family back to the late 1800's . I'm trying to find the ones who walked on The trails of Tears . My mom gave me photos today of my great , great , grandparents . I'm so happy I can put faces to the names I ' ve been researching . I Love It !!! I now need to go to Seattle to look thru microfilm of the early 1800's and the search for my family goes on . It is time consuming though , but really worth it . 
Need to take a break from my search . It's becoming an obsession . 
Finally , getting to meet my good friend that i've made over the past few years . Very Nervous .....
