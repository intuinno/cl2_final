I refuse to watch < PROPFIRST > cowgirl incompetence ! I'm turning to the weather channel . 

Ok , the cowgirls finally got it together . If they keep making dumb mistakes it's going to get ugly . But for tonight ;-) 
Thanks everybody . Had a great day and finished it off with friends and family at the Kenney Store . 
Conway Sr. passed away August 15 , 2010 , at his home near Bellville , Texas , at the age of 79 years after battling cancer for several years . Anyone who knew Conway , knew he was an avid fox/wolf < PROPMALE > . He knew the “voices” of countless hounds and exactly what they were saying . He was the welcoming committee at the back door to greet everyone with a smile , a wave , and a big howdy . 
Today is the Southern Division Texas State Skat Tournament . It starts at 10 am in Giddings Texas . 1st prize is a 2011 < PROPFEMALE > , 2nd prize 2 round trip tickets to Altenburg Germany and 3rd prize is a truck load of Shiner Bock .
