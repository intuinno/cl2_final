Stealing some wifi on my lunch break to wish all a good new year . 

There is no such thing as real love anymore . Everybody is too wrapped up in themselves to give any part of them to anybody . Even when you know you love someone , I can guarantee you they don't love you . People have forgotten how to care for one another .

~ It's How You Deal With Failure That Determines How You Achieve Success ~ 
><<>>< Not to believe in love is a great sign of dullness . There are some people so indirect and lumbering that they think all real affection must rest on circumstantial evidence ><<>>< 
People should be more concerned when someone doesn't take the time to point out potential wrongs/flaws or dislikes . If they were to tell you that you were perfect and nothing was wrong or bothering them .... surely they are not only lying to you ... but them self as well .
