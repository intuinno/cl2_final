-Into the Woods 
Time may heal all wounds , but the scar will always be there as a painful reminder . 
Into the woods , then out of the woods . And home before dark . 
Worrying will do you no good . If he's safe , then he's safe . And if he's been crushed ... well , there's nothing we can do about that , is there ? - Cinderelle's < PROPMALE > from Into the Woods 
Yes , no , maybe . Can you repeat the question ? 
Inorder to gain power , one must first destroy power . 
Sometimes a jump forward requires two steps back , and sometimes all it takes is the will to jump . 
I just ... I just ... I just want the day to be over with . 
Oh if I only had a brain ... wait a minute ... there's one in the fridge ! 
Regeneration process complete . 
From 3 to 5 I was captain < PROPFEMALE > and from 5 to 7 I became a bringer of death to demons . I really did miss being a player in D&D .

Have yourself an Ozzy little Christmas\ 
Give a bat a bite\ 
Decorate your devil head with twinkling lights\ 
He's repented his bolder days\ 
His druggie ways of yore\ 
Faithful friends who got smashed with him , don't bring hash to him no more\ 
Through the slurs you almost can decipher\ 
When he speaks aloud\ 
He's the hottest < PROPFEMALE > among the head-bang crowd\ 
So have yourself an Ozzy , Ozzy , little Christmas now 
The restroom door said gentleman so I just walked inside , \ 
I took two steps and realized I've been taken for a ride . \ 
I heard high voices , turned and found the place was occupied , \ 
By two nuns , three old ladies and a nurse . \ 
What could be worse ? \ 
Than two nuns , three old ladies and a nurse . 
I won one hundred dollars in the lottery this year ! I love Christmas ! 
Had a wonderful walk today . 
Good < PROPMALE > Wenceslas looked out\ 
On the feast of Stephen\ 
When the snow lay round about\ 
Deep and crisp and even\

When a poor man came in sight\ 
Gath'ring winter fuel ... 
Tomorrow I start with a clean Blanket .

What do I have in my pocket ? 
There once was an old man of Esser , \ 
Whose knowledge grew lesser and lesser , \ 
It at last grew so small\ 
He knew nothing at all , \ 
And now he's a college professor .

When I woke up on Saturday morning , \ 
I didn't want to open my eyes . \ 
I didn't want to leave my pillow . \ 
I didn't need to see a < PROPFEMALE > sky . 
A red sun < PROPFEMALE > above the horizon . It's light illuminating the town of Gethal . It was this day this very mourning that by < PROPMALE > the gears of fate began turn , forcing unforeseeable events to occur . And in this < PROPFEMALE > of a new day a simple farmer was going about his chores . His name was Ezreth and he was a tall skrawny lad of 21 years . And as he tended to his feilds he noticed a hooded figure heading for his house . 
Somehow Holst's Jupiter , the Bringer of Jollity seems appropriate for today . 
Today I start with a clean blanket . 
No more questions please , no more tests . \ 
Comes the day you say what for . \ 
Please no more . 
There are Giants in the sky ! \ 
There are big tall terrible awesome scary wonderful\ 
Giants in the sky ! 
Long ago in a land far far far way , there was a great tower . 
Damn . 
I feel like I could take on an Ork Waaagh ! single handedly . 
Despite one minor inconvenience ( which I have taken as a learning opportunity ) today was a great day . 
Only in death do we find answers . 
You might go to West < PROPFEMALE > if you still have to o to school after it was destroyed by an atomic bomb . 
To everyone who thought or hoped for a snow day tomorrow : You were right and I was wrong . ( Though I still wish the snow day was on another day except Wensday ) 
Things I learned today :\ 
1 ) Don't drive by Taco < PROPFEMALE > or Dairy < PROPFEMALE > when < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are in the car\ 
2 ) < PROPMALE > + < PROPFIRST > + Car + me = Two toddlers and a PO'ed me\ 
3 ) NEVER EVER EVER GO SLEDDING WITH YOUR KEYS IN YOUR COAT POKET ! EVER ! 
Our perfections and talents make us desirable . Our flaws and failures make us lovable . 
It's kinda nice knowing that even as a legal adult my *** can still me feel uncomfortable by talking about my personal life . 
Oh unrequited love\ 
you do not come from heven above . \ 
For you are a torture I endure . \ 
But do I blame the person whom I adore\ 
or do I blame myself for being unsure ? \ 
But time - TIME HAS NOT RUN OUT ! \ 
I STILL CAN TURN IT ABOUT ! \ 
Forget who is to blame\ 
when there is time to start a flame . \ 
For whats to come I cannot say\ 
for I have till the end of May . 
See them over there\ 
See them moving down the road\ 
Their arms held out ahead\ 
And their eyes , their eyes are closed 
Night is darkest before the dawn , \ 
Winter is coldest before the Spring , \ 
Life is most precious around birth , \ 
Life is most joyous at matrimony , \ 
Life is most meaningful at death . 
Me : ( Knock on door)\ 
Teacher : ( opens door ) \Hey ! so are you the Love Doctor ? \ " \ 
As the shadow of winter passes in the wake of spring , so to will the shadow death pass in the wake of Necromancy . 
Between my brother throwing up and my sister spraying more than enough Frebreeze , I can't figure out who's making the house smell worse . 
And so the cycle is complete . From me to < PROPFEMALE > , from < PROPFEMALE > to me , taken by < PROPFEMALE > , from < PROPFEMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > , from < PROPFEMALE > to < PROPFIRST > , and from < PROPFIRST > to me . 
Who needs big brother when your grandmother reads every post on facebook ? 
Oh little nonsence have you any words ?

SIBLING WAR !!! Copy this if you are the best and smartest of your siblings . If this stands for one week without your brothers & sisters protesting , it is sssoooooo true !! 
No more questions , \

No more tests . \ 
Comes the day you say , \What for ? \ " \ 
Tomorrow I will be bald , good please please I don't want to be accidentally scalped . \ 
Also reminder : Catholics wear green tomorrow , protestants orange . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Chytrowsky if you wear green , white , or orange I will pinch until the end of the day , fair warning . 
Responsibility is 5% dependability , 5% accountablity , 90% taking ownership of ALL the consequences . 
Note : Twinings ' Pepermint tea has a strong smell , but will not affect the flavor of the other teas it is stored with . 
The evil wizard turned towards the last survivors and laughed as his zombie minions went in for the kill . With sword and dagger in hand and rage in his heart our hero charged onward . He let a heroic battle cry \Never give in never surrender ! \ " just before ten zombies mauled him to death . \ 
Lycanthrope Christmas tomorrow !!! 
We never really change who we are or what we are like , we only find new ways to express ourselves . 
A Random act of Kindness 
Only when you've lost something do you realize its true value . 
One litter of Mountain Dew to whom ever can come up with the best name for a fictional character . \ 
Rules and stipulations : the name must be feminine , only one name per entrant , and submitted name may not hint at sterotypes or racial/ethnic slurs . 
And so comes the long awaited moment . Sink or swim , pass or fail , do or die it all comes down to one roll of dice . 
After a month and a half I finally took the sleds out of my car . ( Pathetic ) 
I'm making a lemon poppy seed cake . 
Finished making two lemon poppy seed cakes . 
Opportunity is not a lengthy vistor . 
I had fun today . 
? i ne afl ? m în aceea ? i mizerie vechi cântând cântece de leag ? n beat . 
Oh little nonsense , have you any words ? 
It's rather saddening how easily we fall into cycles , patterns , and habits . Never will we truely progress until they are broken . 
Mors naturalis pars vitam , quoniam omnes ocius participes facit .
