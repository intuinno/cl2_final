Congrats to TCU ..... Rose Bowl Champs !!! 
Job is going ok ... its second shift ... which I hate . They do pay very well though so I can't complain too much . I don't know how to put the pic up . Can't figure it out on this G1 . 
I'm startin ' my workout Monday . P90X ...... need I say more . The scale said I weighed .... wait a minute ... that's my business only ! You'll find out only if it works ( p90x ) . 
Everyone knows that what \Goes Around\ " also \ " Comes Around . \ " Make sure that you \ " Recognize\ " when the \ " Comes Around\ " is upon YOU !!! "

OK !!! So I lost 15 pounds in two weeks . Only 100 more to go . :P 
It's better to assume that one is n idiot than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt ! 
It's 3:00 am and I am still at work . I'm not complaining because about a year ago .... I had NO job . 13 hour days are the norm now , except for Fridays . Anybody got the #'s for the Lotto ???!!! 
Finally made it home . 9 hours more and its back to work . Good night ... and Good mornin ' . 
So .... now I have to work all weekend .... let's see .... from this past Monday to the Saturday after tomorrow is how many days in a row ??? 
The essence of a man is not measured by what everyone can see , but by the action he takes when he thinks no one is watching . 
You know ... I just figured out something ...... The only thing I get to do at home is PAY THE BILLS !!! 
A word to the wise ??? The wise don't need a word . It's the idiots that need talkin ' to .

Through humor , you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers . And once you find laughter , no matter how painful your situation might be , you can survive it . 
Ok . It's another 3 o'clock-er . How do you go to work on a day where the sun is still shining ( afternoon ) , and get off of work and the sun is almost about to shine ..... AGAIN ?!?! 
And NO !!! You're not a genius ..... you're just knowledgable in some subjects I really don't give a rats ass about !

So I finally get a Saturday off .... whoop-de-doo ! Then I get to work 21 days in a row ... or somethin ' like that . Any time travelers on FB got some lotto < PROPFIRST > they wanna share with me ?

So ... who's up at 3 o'clock with me ?..... anyone ?..... I gotta hit the lotto or set it off or somethin'!!! Anyone agree ??? 
Don't borrow someone else's spectacles to view yourself with . 
My attitude is that if you push me towards something that you think is a weakness , then I will turn that perceived weakness into a strength . 
I'm at Concentra getting ready to take a UA ( drug test ) . I've been here for 15 minutes . Don't these people know that I gotta piss like a race horse ??? These people are takin ' their sweet time , watchin ' T.V. and SH*T !!! They better hurry up before they are taking samples from this fake tree sittin ' beside me !!!

You know FB'ers ..... I hate when someone lies to me . It's not the lie that makes me angry . It's the fact that someone thinks my mentality is so infantile that i'll believe that SH*T in the first place !!! You feel me ? Immaturity breeds lies . Grow up people ... You know who you are !!! Also , I've said this once , but I think I need to say it again ..... If you don't know the answer , would you please SHUT THE HELL UP !!!
