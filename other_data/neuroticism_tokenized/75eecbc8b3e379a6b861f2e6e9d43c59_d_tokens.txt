Blame the cussin ' on my Daddy , good looks on my Mama\

It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why , babe\ 
It don’t matter , anyhow\ 
An’ it ain’t no use to sit and wonder why , babe\ 
If you don’t know by now\ 
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn\ 
Look out your window and I’ll be gone\ 
You’re the reason I’m trav’lin’ on\ 
Don’t think twice , it’s all right 
Come gather ' round people\ 
Wherever you roam\ 
And admit that the waters\ 
Around you have grown\ 
And accept it that soon\ 
You'll be drenched to the bone\ 
If your time to you\ 
Is worth savin'\ 
Then you better start swimmin'\ 
Or you'll sink like a stone\ 
For the times they are a-changin ' .
