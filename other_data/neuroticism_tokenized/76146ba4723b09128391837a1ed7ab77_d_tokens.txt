Is in Christmas mode ... Lights are already up and the neighbors are trying to one up us ... HAHAHA we will see ! We will be making another trip to Lowes today . Muahahaha 

So lame ... someone actually stole one of our light up reindeer from the front yard . Happy freaking holidays ! I could care less about the reindeer ; just the fact that someone would do something like that bums me out .

A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week , or that your family is not perfect ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and ... never question their friendship REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least 1 true friend .

So lame ... I can't find my phone charger any where ! Please leave a message and I will call you later =P

Unfortunately most women won't repost this . I'm strong willed , independent , and outspoken , I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . If you're a HANDFUL then post this on your status

Mayhem Fest kicked my butt ! It was worth it though ... =) 
Great weekend ... Friday night I went to lips with my mom and her friends , Saturday I went to the San < PROPMALE > Zoo with < PROPMALE>'s family and today I basically locked my self in my room for a little rest and rejuvenation . Hopefully this week will be just as good as my weekend . \ 
Now it's time to get cozy with my < PROPFEMALE > and watch something scary . =) 
Anyone can give up , it's the easiest thing in the world to do . But to hold it together when everyone elsewould understand if you fell apart , that's true strength . -unknown 
... can't sleep ='( 
is feeling AWESOME today ! I slept great and when I woke up ... I could have sworn I was in a disney movie . The birds were singing , the sun was shinning and I would not have been the least surprised to see singing mice making my bed . \ 
Hopefully the rest of the week will be just as sweet =) 
Dear sun ... you suck ! Don't call & don't e-mail ... we are no longer friends ! \ 
I spent the day in San < PROPMALE > and got burned beyond recognition ... bring on the aloe < PROPFEMALE > ! =( 
Is loving life ! The worst of the sun burn suffering is over and I can't wait to get out of the house ! Tomorrow ... back to the beach with my girls ! This time I will be sure to slather on SPF 70 sun screen =) 
Okay ... so I know I am totally late on this BUT Inception was absolutely incredible ! Now if I could just shake the headache it gave and stop re-analyzing it in my head I could go to sleep . ::: sigh ::: 
haha ... Jayden is desperately trying to buckle him self into his car seat ( which is sitting on the living room floor ) . I wonder where he thinks he's going to go ... 
Hey ... my cousin is looking for a room to rent . He can afford about $400-$500 bucks a month . Please let me know if you have a room you can rent for that much or if you know someone . THANK YOU SO MUCH ! <3 
Oh my gosh ! We have actually found a venue that is affordable and BEAUTIFUL ! I had just about given up all hope for a traditional wedding and was planning to elope in October ! Yay ! I'm sooooooooooooo excited ! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the date I have my heart set on isn't scooped up before we make the deposit . 
Homemade play-dough = a very happy son ! We made two types of play-dough tonight ... One of which was a huge success . Lol , Jayden fell asleep with a huge ball of it in his hand ! Tomorrow we tackle homemade silly putty =)

You meet people who forget you . \ 
You forget people you meet . \ 
But sometimes you meet those people you can't forget ... \ 
Those are your friends . \ 
A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when you have an argument . A real friend knows that it's not a friendship until after you've had a fight . <3
