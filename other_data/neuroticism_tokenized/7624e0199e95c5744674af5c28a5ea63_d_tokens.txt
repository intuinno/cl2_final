if you kick me while i'm down i'll break your leg . 

Trying to find a reason , a reason things went wrong , trying to find a reason my moneys all gone . 
I will write you a song , that's how you'll know my love is still strong . 
You can illustrate your death in romance 
You spend your time sitting in circles with your friends , pontificating \ 
to each other , forever competing for that one moment of self \ 
aggrandizing < PROPFEMALE > in which you hog the intellectual spotlight , holding \ 
dominion over the entire SHALLOW .... POINTLESS ... conversation . 
When you walk by a group of quote-unquote normal people you chuckle to yourself , patting yourself on the back as you scoff . 
Eye for an eye , And a tooth for a tooth , Blood for blood \ 
\ 
We've all gotta die \ 
We've all gotta die 
Rebel souls Deserters we've been called Chose a gun And threw away the sun Now these towns they all know our names The death punch sound is our claim to fame 
MY HAIR IS BLUE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
back to the grindstone in a couple of hours ... wonder if anyone at atlee still remebers me 
i cant sleep till i touch your face 
About that hell of a class that you like to refer to as math ......... 
If you cut me i suppose i would bleed the colors of the evening stars 
just came back from picking apples in the blue ridge !! 
Preach all you want but who's gonna save me ? I keep a gun on the book you gave me , hallelujah , lock and load . Black is the kiss , the touch of the serpent son , it ain't the < PROPFIRST > or the scar that makes you one . 
Someone get me to the doctor , and someone call the nurse . And someone buy me roses , and someone burned the church . We're hanging out with corpses , we're driving in this hearse . And someone save my soul tonight , please save my soul . 
Back in VA from NYC !!!!! Best trip EVER !!! Pics coming soon !! 
There's less violence in the world when people are using Hula-Hoops . 
Needs the new Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock game or she will die a very slow and painful death 
Can not wait to dress up in her $85 Halloween costume 
sprained/fractured her ankle and now is limping around like someone shot her 
They're gonna clean up your looks , with all the lies and the books , to make a citizen out of you . Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you son so they can watch all the things that you do . 
going to paint some random little kids tonight 
All I want is a fucking banana split !!!! Is that too much to ask ?!?!?! 
Sometimes I give myself the creeps , Sometime my mind plays tricks on me , It all keeps adding up , I think I'm cracking up , Am I just paranoid ? 
To Write Love On Her Arms 
And I know you hear their voices , and I know they may seem real , but our life's made up of choices , They took for granted your soul and now it's ours to steal . \ 
As your nightmare comes to life . 
Don't you just love it when someone is mad at something/someone else and then takes it out on you , even tough you had nothing whatsoever to do with it and have do idea what they are talking about ? 
Oh , let me tell you about the sad man . \ 
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands . \ 
Remember when you were a madman , Thought you was BATMAN ! \ 
And hit the party with a gas can . \ 
Kiss me you animal ! 
I so wanna dye my hair firengine red 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes you guys !! Love ya'll!! 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicaps not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . Can I make a request : is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour to spread the awareness ? It is ...... Special Education Week , and this is in honor of ALL the children who were wonderfully and marvelously made .

Dear immature students , \ 
Flinging rubber bands at new people in your class is not cool . When you are in 11th grade it is even less cool . So please go with your little group of friends that think such things are cool and leave me alone . \ 
Thank you , \ 
April 
cold hearted orb that rules the night removes the colours from our sight red is gray and yellow white but we decide which is right and which is an illusion . 
Gazing at people , some hand in hand . Just what I'm going through they can't understand . Some try to tell me , thoughts they cannot defend . Just what you want to be , you will be in the end . 
had a sucky weekend , i packed a bag a left home it got so bad friday night . just now got back . would still be gone if not for school . 
Blow a kiss at the methane skies , see the rust through your playground eyes , we're all in love tonight . Leave a dream where the fallout lies , watch it grow with the trearstain dries , to keep you safe tonight . 
Yo , I'll tell you what I want , what I really really want , \ 
So tell me what you want , what you really really want , \ 
I'll tell you what I want , what I really really want , \

Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes to win when the match when it is even . 
Music is the wine that fills the cup of silence . 
They say hate is such a strong word but they throw love around like it's nothing . 
So if you're too school for cool \ 
And you're treated like a fool \ 
You could choose to let it go\ 
We can always , we can always\
