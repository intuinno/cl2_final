Two words : Hallowneen Town Definition : The most awesome movie series ever . ( Sorry < PROPMALE > Potter , Lord of the Rings , < PROPFEMALE > Wars , and The Land Before Time ) 
Why are lifetime movies always so dramatic ? Why am I even watching the lifetime movie network ? 
Dryer lint . Something needs to be done with dryer lint . We just throw it away after each load . Think of the wasted potential . Yes , it's too fragile to spin into thread , but why not insulation ? Why don't we use it to fill pillows for the homeless ? Just a thought ...

Stupid Facebook . I like boys . 
Back in the 90s there was a marker commercial that featured a song that I absolutely loved . I never knew what the song was , but I always liked it . After a decade of searching , I finally found the song I was looking for . Feel free to congratulate me . 
I must be sick because I feel like studying .

... Except then he would have to go to the nurse because of the arrow in his face . 
SpongeBob gogurt ? Yes , please . =] 
I should be at < PROPFEMALE>'s house watching the superbowl . Stupid snow . We don't have CBS purchased so I can't watch the superbowl at home , either . Stupid Direct TV , I never wanted you . 
Facebook , you look so different ! Why have you changed like this ? 
A straight week of snow is like letting a raccoon into your house . Sounds cool until you actually try it . 
There's no music playing on MTV ... or MTV2 ... or BET ... or VH1 ... or VH1C ... or CMT . Seriously , what gives ? 
I should've waited til this evening to check Collegeboard .. My SAT scores ruined my day . 
Hey AC kids ... Lvl 4 English Monday class to be exact ... Do we have class this Monday ? Isn't this Monday a holiday ? 
Ambassador status ?? Quite possibly ...

Speaking in metaphors ...

Hello everybody . =] I'm feeling friendly . 
Anyone in Dr. Colwell's Monday English class .... I'm confused about this whole group A , B , C thing . Could someone explain it ?

Why can't I be champion ? Where's my vorpal sword ? That's the thing about fantastic tales . They're just too fantastc . 
awesome . awesome . awesome . awesomeawesomeawesomeawesomeawesome <3 fjdu <3 
Just because youre a member of the Gilmore family doesn't mean you can go telling your mom about your life . Learned this the hard way . 
You don't mess with my family , you don't mess with my things , and you don't mess with me . Easy concept . Apparently not for everyone . 
Hey guys .... Black sneakers . Does anyone have a pair I can borrow for the pep rally tomorrow ? Someone stole mine . I'd love you forever if you had a pair i could use . 
It's spring cleaning day . D= Buuuuuuut ! I will make the most of it by turning off the ac and opening every window in the house ! LET IN THE SPRING !!! =] 
I want to live a full life ... and in the end look back and be happy with the fact that I'm human enough to live like one . -fjdu <3

After three months of extensive research , I've come to the conclusion that I am in fact the luckiest girl on Earth . <3 
OH EE OH KILLER TOFU ! 
Yup ... I spent my afternoon making calzones . You don't have to say it ; I already know I'm cool . 
LeBron < PROPFIRST > signed with the Miami Heat . I didn't see that coming at all . 
I suppose I'll go play the violin until my fingers fall off ... or until I get tired . Whichever comes first . 
I think my mother just gave an icecream cone for dinner . 
This weather is killing my elbow . Idk how I'm gonna get through colorguard today . I need some arthritis rub or a bionic arm or something ... 
Last night , my mother and I brought our outdoor kitten into my room to live with me . Then , we shopped at Wal-Mart until nearly midnight for cat items . Then , we stayed up until one-thirty bathing her , and trying to get her to like the bed we bought . This morning she cried until I got out of bed and held her in my arms . What have I gotten myself into ? 
I had a wonderful time today with Vonshea and < PROPMALE > . =] 
My AP summer work is rather depressing ... For psych , I'm reading a book about people with incurable mental diseases . For Spanish , there's a story that kills off a little boy's friend within the first three paragraphs . My goodness . 
anyone else in georgetown notice the purple water today ? 
Fair today . Unless my mom doesn't bring my truck back . Why does she always take my truck ? 
I had a dream that I met a family of tap dancers . They taught me some cool moves and we tapped together in my front yard . Then later , I was in a talent competition , but I forgot my violin so I had to make up a new talent on the fly . Why didn't I just tap dance ? I should have tap danced . 
Revenge of the Nerds ! =] what a fun movie 
I had a dream that someone in my back yard served me a deep-fried tarantula . The tempura batter was pretty tasty but I didn't care too much for the spider itself . 
Ughhh can somebody help me with my AP Spanish ? 
I wish I had 300 bucks for that speed reading course . 
I was putting clothes away and discovered a teeney < PROPFEMALE > spider living in my momma's pants drawer . Instead of squishing him , I scooped him up and walked him all the way outside in hopes that he would live to see another day . I'm glad he didn't bite me or try any funny business because , now that I think about it , spiders give me the willies . 
Little kids think my back yard is a park . 
You've been spending your time thinking about why you think so much . If there was ever a time , now would be the time to see your time here is limited . 
IT'S SNOWING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Birthday Birthday Birthday . =]
