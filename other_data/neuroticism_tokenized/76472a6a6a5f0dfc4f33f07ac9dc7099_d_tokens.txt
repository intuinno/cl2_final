Got back last night from a Mother's Day visit in SOUTHERN Indiana . It was wonderful . < PROPFEMALE > came , too . We played games , played in the yard , took an edible food walk , saw my sister and her boyfriend , and made great food for Mom's Day . It was great . 

Had a dream I was hanging out with my sister . We somehow ended up on a metal trailer on the highway ... Someone was cleaning the stainless steel fry kitchen . It was a man cleaning up his failing business .... Lil sis and I decided we would buy the trailer and start a mobile restaurant . A pie restaurant ... It would be called Good Pie . The plan was to sell good pies . It was a good idea . 
I've been off facebook for a spell . i want to be a little more facebook-personable in the upcoming few ... weeks ? months ? here's hoping !! 
Just got my first tomato of the season out of our garden !!! \

First day at my new job was a sweet summer breeze .
