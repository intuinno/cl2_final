is going to do a new venture this year besides the new year's resolutions that i fail to complete =/ lol Ooops ! haha , but seriously I am taking into consideration of writing a new book since the last book i was writing kinda sucked ! Got to go to work tomorrow but not tripping , I miss my coworkers lol ... too much too say haha , but HAPPY NEW YEARS !!! 

is wanting to go see my great grandmother today , i love her very much and i intend to see her even if i have to [[ hitchhike]] <-- lol just kidding ;) .... is thinking that dreams do come true as long as you have the will to believe in them ... I live when I dream and I dream when I live ... 
thinking that some people need to grow up , 
is thinking that i need to stop putting off and go to the ER .... ='[ .... 
Hoping very much today will be a good day .... 
omg some people are so stupid , you choose your road , you choose to go back to running in circles , hope you have fun ... immature bullshit .... < PROPFEMALE > will come knocking at your door . 
feels like the most stupidest person in the world ... 
Why do people wear sunglasses inside the store , is it < PROPFEMALE > inside ? Are the lights too bright ... Or do they just think that they are cool cuz if they do they're wrong they just look stupid . Lol

got my Texas Longhorn Dress ready , we are gonna kick some ass ! 
Saw a shooting < PROPFEMALE > streak across a dark cloudy night sky ... it gave me hope that this year is going to be a good year , it was like a sign from God that things will get better , that yes it has been rough , it has been difficult , tears fell but Its all leading into a better and brighter future with bigger smiles , longer sunsets , and more dreams to come true . 
Drama is created by those who have no life and need entertainment , by those who are disappointed with their life and want to ruin other's life , why play this pointless game where in the end no one wins , play this game but leave me out i want no part of it , i love my life and am happy where i am .

Blindside is officially a < PROPMALE > Favorite movie !!! Gonna see if we can do some more philanthropy at work and give back to the communnity . :) 
\The Blind Side\ " is officially a < PROPMALE > Favorite movie !!! Gonna see if we can do some more philanthropy at work and give back to the communnity . :) " 
So < PROPFIRST > is gonna keep < PROPMALE > Phillips , this could be a good thing or bad thing depending on how we look at it ....

If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together .. there is something you must always remember . you are braver than you believe , stronger than you seem , and smarter than you think . but the most important thing is , even if we're apart .. i'll always be with you . ” 
“Spiteful words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks your heart . ” 
I close my eyes and imagine what could of been , I get so lost in the words of past , in the memories that flood my mind , that when the < PROPFEMALE > goes off i wake up and realize it can never be , make best of what we got now and be sure to realize when we got something good in front of us before its too late .

If you just realize what I just realized , Then we'd be perfect for each other and will never find another Just realized what I just realized we'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other now . 
\And I'll be by your sideWherever you fallIn the dead of nightWhenever you callAnd please don't fightThese hands that are holding youMy hands are holding you \""

Too be human is to laugh and cry , to be human is to be happy and sad , emotion is what gives us our personality , it seperates one person from another person , it makes us unique . To have no emotion is to be a robot , plain , gray , cold , with no personality at all ... =] ...!!! & hearts ; yall guys !

[[ Years will fly by like the light of a < PROPFEMALE > \ 
racing across the sky\ 
Pictures will fade ; flowers will crinkle & \ 
dry , there will be hellos & there will be goodbyes\ 
The road will \

No\

& Ill always care]]\
