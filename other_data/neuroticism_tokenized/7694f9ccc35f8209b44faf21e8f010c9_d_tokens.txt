Jazz concert tonight . Excited . 

< PROPFIRST > Stock was hella fun . 
graduation . yippy . so excited . ( pretty much all sarcasm but i don't know why ) 
Fuck the people who say things happen for a reason . Instant gratification is much more appealing to me . I'm a love struck , idealistic fool with issues . 
I don't know what to do with myself . Everything feels wrong . 
The past , it's full of regrets that i cannot for the life of me forget . I decay remembering my inadequacies that I've come to find will be the ultimate end of me . 
='{ ='{ ='{ 
progressing through the steps of grief as scheduled . Currently on anger . 
I'm good . Life's good . 
Writin ' , recordin ' and mixin ' some music . 
Fuckin A+ on the Calculus Final . Hellz yeah . \A\ " for the year . I R WINRAR . " 
But for now I'll look so longingly waiting for you to want me , for you to need me , for you to notice me . 
Sleeping my life away . You know , the usual . 
Woke up at 1:23 ( not my fault : I have no windows in my room and my clock was blinking 12:00 still from the lost power ) and played Fallout 3 all day . Pretty successful day if you ask me ... not . 
Life is far better when you have someone to love . There is no comparison . 
\Please hold me tightly I don't care if I can breath tonight . \"" 
Ramen for lunch because literally it was the only food left in the house . 
I can't seem to shake this sinking feeling in my gut , not like I'm really trying to hard . Being miserable is just easier . 
GET OUT OF MY FREAKIN ' HEAD . 
Mood/opinion swings are killing me . 
Rafting was awesome . Extraordinarily amazing . 
SMILES ! Which is pretty sick considering I've felt pretty shitty all summer . lol . 
Recording time now again . 
Will today be a third awesome day in a row perhaps ? I believe so . =D 
Will the words come ? I hope so . Because when they do , I'm totally gonna put them down in song form . =] 
Off to Vermont . I miss you already ... is that bad ? 
I get so happy thinking about you . =] 
I was going to have a nice lunch today , but my dumb girlfriend had to go ahead and cut her finger open with a REALLY sharp knife . Way to go , babe . lol . 
First day of classes 
YAY ! You're here ! 
loving life as ( un)usual 
Thank you all for the happy wishes . you make my insides all warm and shit like that .

I got the dews duude . 
with sighs cloaked in comatose slumber . ? 
I get to see < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow ! Woot ! 
Fuck < PROPFIRST > . He deleted all the posts .

This one time , I told a really long and interesting story as my facebook status and everybody loved it so much that they gave me money and made me the < PROPMALE > of everything . 
Succesfully setup two sets of rockband drums to work as an electronic drumset by using four different programs ( including Addictive Drums for the drum samples ) and by plugging things in in the exact right order . I feel accomplished . =] 
dicks in my butt 
Hoping to get straight \A\ " s . " 
Classes are going well . 
Back at school after a nice long weekend . Silly Massachusetts and its funny holidays . 
cocks in my butt 
Home for the summer 
got five ' A's , six ' B's , and a ' C ' with a GPA of 3.30 . I'm pretty happy with this . 
Posted a new song : \December\ " http://soc.li/86YUOzU " 
mowing the lawn is relaxing . 
My name is < PROPMALE > Morrison . And I like my butt touched . A lot . 
people who post everything they do on facebook make me laugh . 
I'm wearing long sleeves and pants and I'm still freezing my tits off backstage at the town hall theater . 
Thank you everybody ! 
studying for my ece final . 
ece exam complete . Next is English Poetry and then Statistics and then I'm done . whoopy . 
Maybe I'm at home , maybe at work , maybe at play . What's it to you and why do you care what I'm doing in the first place ? Humans have an interesting social appetite . 
Getting Ready for a night with the boys like the good old days . 
ECE 2111 Professor is outstandingly boring . yay . 
\It's really fun until we run out of holes ... \"" 
Walking down the side walk , there's 3-5 feet of snow on either side with the occasional 6 foot lump , but I think those are cars ... 
What happened to high school ? It was four pretty important years of my moral-developmental life , and yet now it feels so distant and immature . 
Thinking about learning how to play the song , \In My Waking Life\ " by Saves The Day . " 
Why am I awake still ? 
My girlfriend just through out her back while reaching for a french fry . :/ 
Work work work
