As a metaphor , consider infrared goggles . A person leans on a tree . At night , we don't see the person . Put the goggles on , and a new reality results -- a truer reality -- and we see the man . Similarly , is it possible that our brain is a filter , and the use of DMT is like slipping on infrared goggles , allowing us to perceive a valid reality that is inches away and all around us ? 
A quote from by < PROPMALE > Pickover talking about the molecule DMT ( N , N-Dimethyltryptamine ) ...

I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Just one hour . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . Thank you ! 
I loves my man !!!
