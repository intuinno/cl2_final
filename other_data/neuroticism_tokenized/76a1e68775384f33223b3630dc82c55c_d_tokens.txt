All of you ... are disgusting , immoral beast ! You should all feel disgraced , and wish to hide your faces ! How dare you , every single one of you ... Hold your farts till your alone , damn it ! * Coughs , gags ... * I'm .... Dying ! 

Why am I so mean and angry ? Cause it comes so naturally , and without thought . If you don't get the jokes , then fuck off an die . That's what I wanna do ! Wheeee ! 
What is it ? To say something kind , and at the time to tell the truth ? As false kindness can be just as good as true caring , as many know not the difference . So I say unto you all ; you are beautiful , you are brilliant , you are loved , and I am a great liar . ^^ 
Mmmmm I likes Abney Park very much . 
That's right ladies and gent's . Once a year it comes around , and it's a day for celebration . That's right , its the day to celebrate the Saint < PROPFIRST>'s Day Massacre ! Yes folks , the day that brutal murder happened in the neighborhood of Lincln Park in Chicago on this day in 1929 ! 
WTF ? < PROPFIRST > Steele died ? Son of a bitch ! That pisses me the fuck off . * Sighs * What an awesome musician . I'm so glad I went to that Jagermiester tour a few years ago . R . I . P . Mr. Ratajczyk 
Vacation stuff is over tomorrow , and for some reason I feel oddly full of energy , yet i'm still feeling ready to culr up and sleep . What a weird feeling . 
I hate change , but even I sometimes feel a need for it . 
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/534416 For those old school gamers ... It's Super < PROPFIRST > Crossover ! Awesome ! ( I actually saw this a little while ago . Forgot to share >_<) 
Damn amazing . Idiot neighbors park in front of our place like they pay our rent , the air is thick with pot , and people sneaking between the different places at like 1:30 am ... Why can't these people be finished off life vermin ? Most here would loose against a mouse in a maze race . 
My mind is a fucked up place sometimes . I mean it's bad , some of the idea's I get for running games , or jokes , or just random happenings . My dreams though can just be .... gah , last nights was very ... Hitckcock like . 
Gnar , must make dinner . So don't wanna though . Must find slacks and dress shirt , get washed tomorrow . Feel like someones poisoned me , so don't wanna do anything . 
Getting paid by the state for work is like gambling in a casino . Sooner or later your gonna hit , but it's always later then you need . 
Not to mention it's never enough money .... 
Weekend went well , was a lovely wedding . Bride and Groom were happy . People seemed to enjoy themselves . I'm dying from the heat in here . 
Seems some people don't consider a morbid sense of a humor , humor . There are different levels of humor , different taste in humor . From shit like < PROPFIRST > the cable guy , to < PROPMALE > White , to < PROPFEMALE > Sykes , to < PROPFIRST > Black . People should learn this . 
Friend : \So when are ya gonna marry\ " Me : \ " 3 years after I put a \ 
Gnar guess I'm not heading down for the 4th like I thought , sorry guys . 
Happy 4th all , the day for booms and pretty lights . Bah I shoulda headed down south anyway for them heh . 
Back from Sonoma County . Went to < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding , and it all went well . I think it was the most amusing wedding ceremony I've been to , geekdom from the guy performing the ceremony , and having attended a decent part of ' Justin-day ' ... and the driving . So tired . Must clean though . I should have bought some whiskey or something to get through all this . 
* LOL * Thanks all for the birthday wishes ^^ 
Gnar just woke up . Should eat , but its so muggy and warm .... Come on winter , hurry up . 
You\ 
and I wake up in jail together . Using only FOUR words , what would you \ 
say to me ? ( NOTE : If you comment , you gotta copy and paste this in your \ 
status -- fair is fair -- play along ) 
2 Am , and bored off my ass .... You all fucking suck 
Remind me why we keep on living ? * LOL * 
Piece on Laptop breaks a month ago , get it fixed , sat receiver breaks , get it replaced , laptop breaks again , replace it .. now TV goes out .... WTF ? Seriously .
