Just put together fire pit for the backyard ... can't wait to burn things ! Fire , yay ! 
Can't sleep .. might go watch House of the Devil again .. pure awseomeness 
Wow ... sad little comic convention . Fair was neato , got to watch a bunch of fat people and their shrieking children run about so that's always a plus :) 
Just got home from work , tired as hell . Think I might celebrate my day off tomorrow by watching Zombieland . \That'll do pig ... \"" 
WOW ! Super glad that we all stressed to get the store cleaned for absolutely no reason ! Good job , higher ups ! They were probably chilling with Snoop , I heard he was in town tonight .

Best painkillers EVAR 
Just watched Bronson ... good movie , but weird ... 
Just got back form doctor's office , headed to work :P Blah ... going to be a complete jerk tonight . 
Go watch Black Dynamite NOW . Stop reading this , just go watch it , quick ! Oh , and had a total blast from the past , looked up a bunch of people from my old middle school , craziness ... 
Got a Blu-Ray player , woot ! It's pretty neato , even makes Kids in the Hall look sharp . 
Ugh ... feeling pretty crappy today . Have to finish a paper for my AMH class , ultra lameness . Picked up my first two Blu-Rays , Fletch and Black Dynamite , both look pretty good . Never thought I'd get to see Chevy < PROPMALE > in ultra high definition . Oh , and just finished Cabin Fever 2 . Weird , weird movie ... 
So tired ... but now I have Night of the Creeps on Blu < PROPFIRST > so I'm officially the happiest asshole this side of the nuthouse . Wheee ! 
Don't want to work ... gah . 
< PROPFIRST > Haim is dead . Going to be okay , < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Well played , IKEA .... round two , next week . 
Rowsdower ! 
I just found out < PROPFIRST > Graves died . We should all watch a movie about gladiators in his honor . 
Oh so tired ... just got < PROPMALE > season 4 , I'll be back in exactly 20 hours ... 
Had an awesome night ! And HOLY CRAP I just finished < PROPMALE > season 4 .... I'm kind of bummed ... 
I'm thinking about deleting someone based solely on the fact that every other goddamn update on my < PROPFEMALE > is their Farmville info . 
Oh dear God ... Scott Pilgrim trailer is amazing . Also , I finally found what I've been looking for , had a great night . 
I don't want to work ... blahhh .... tomorrow is the Robpocalypse , by the way . And .. holy crap , it didn't spellcheck Robpocalypse , what the fuck ? 
So ... had the worst customer ever today ... I pretty much told him if I saw him again I would murder him where he stood ... I think I need some anger management classes ... 
So .. a marshmellow threatened to break my nose .. 
A marshMALLOW as well ... 
Dude ... I don't want to work . And also , Chowder might be the best show on tv EVAR . 
Did you notice the rain ? When I'm out driving , THE GODS COME OUT TO PLAY ! 
Aquabats ! At State ! Who's going ? 
Another awesome evening , I can get used to this . 
Signed up for my final HCC class , fuck yeah ! 
Wow ... that was pretty fucking deep . Had a good night , watched Whip It , was actually pretty damn good . Listened to Massive Attack on the way home , was ultra chill . 
Paper due Wednesday .. haven't even started it yet . I'm awesome , right ? 
Just overheard someone talking about how they couldn't get through Watchmen , so they watched < PROPFIRST > Blart : Mall Cop instead . And they LOVED IT . My brain hurts . 
The Collector was pretty horrible ... but it did feature someone using a flaming dog as a weapon , so that was good . Went out for sushi with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , was also good . I'd say ... a good night all around . 
So , < PROPMALE > and I were having a magical adventure together when out of nowhere someone decided my Honda would look better with the radiator shoved into the engine . Awesome sauce ! I fucking hate people . RIP Honda . 
So , that paper that I wrote two weeks ago ? Was pretty much sleepwalking through the damn thing . However , by the power of Greyskull , I got an A on it . Boosh . Also , < PROPMALE > is at this competition and I fucking miss her . Blah . 
Just had an amazing dinner with < PROPMALE > . the evening continues ! 
It's Record Store Day ! Going out to vinyl fever to get some stuff . Also , Happy Birthday Mom ! Holy crap there's a lot going on today . And pictures from last night might go up soon . 
Just finished listeing to Somery by the Descendents on vinyl ... today was a good day . Looking forward to < PROPMALE>' award ceremony tomorrow . 
and listening to them , as well 
I feel like a complete jackass . 
This paper is horrible . Mathematical history stuff ? Lameness . 
So ... every single frame of Nightmare on Elm Street ( 2010 ) was pretty much terrible . You would think that a movie where the point was to not fall asleep wouldn't be so fucking boring . Blah . Incredibly lame . 
Reading Infinite Jest , amazing stuff . Also , regarding my kidneys : OWWWWW FUCK . 
It's always awesome to meet fellow nerds . 
One exam left in this semester , let's try to not fuck it up eh ? 
Ugh .. I feel like crap . Stuck at work , want to pass out . I think it's the side effect of watching that GG Allin movie .. 
Work in an hour ... blah . I thought today was pay day , how wrong I was . I'm kind of wanting to go on Amazon and buy a shit load of blu-rays .... but yeah . Not going to happen this month . 
Headed to < PROPMALE > in a few hours , shall be cool . I'll be gone until Thursday , so leave me something to come back to . Love ya , < PROPMALE > , I'll see you in a week . 
On the last day of my vacation . Come by Movie Stop tomorrow and say hi , I missed you guys ! 
I want to listen to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > over the < PROPFEMALE > system .. can you customers get the fuck out already ? grawrfuck 
Getting my USF stuff ready ... woo .... blah .. 
Someone give me money for my tattoo . NAO . 
< PROPMALE > Henson died 20 years ago today . Blah .... 
Of course it's raining , because when I work , the gods come out to play . 
Fuck cycle counts . And summer semester . Everyone waiting for the class to start is playing with their cellphones , except the kid in front of me who just busted out a Rubik's cube . 
< PROPFIRST > Espin , I can't believe that Gorgoroth had a lead singer simply named \Hat . \"" 
< PROPMALE > is awesome ! She just passed her state board exam , so now if you want to go get your hair did you can go to her ! Love you < PROPMALE > ! 
I can't believe the fucking music I used to listen to ... blkdhfjdshfdkjv . Horrible . 
Found my MP3 player ! But ... the Honda is dead again , of course . It's currently sitting all by its lonesome outside of MovieStop , the useless fucking thing . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSY !!!!! Love you , can't wait to see you in a few ! 
Worked a double today .... laaaaame . Looking forward to seeing < PROPMALE > tomorrow , but not looking forward to my debate class . Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . 
Splice was kind of cool . Predictable , but neat . I really dug the opening credits and the music during the scene where they were trying to splice human dna . But yeah ... it was like a 7/10 for me . Oh , and made flyers for the Kick Ass midnight release party , should be pretty cool . 
I hate when you lose something that is really really important , and then after a while , it loses it's importance , and you actually become glad that you lost it , then you find it and it destroys your entire evening . Blahfuck . 
Had an awesome night at Tampa Pitcher Show . Got to see Evil Dead on the big screen , < PROPMALE > got to see it for the first time , and had awesome company with me . July 23rd they are showing Evil Dead 2 , you should join us ! The event was put on by Zombie Emergency Defense , they're pretty damn cool ! Also , I'm pretty sure we were the most hated table ... 
You know how I know that I love my girlfriend ? I have an earache .. a headache .. I'm tired .. and I'm sitting in a packed theater waiting for Twilight : Eclipse to start . < PROPMALE > , you owe me , lol . Oh , and while I wasn't looking she snuck a Team < PROPFIRST > pin onto my shirt . IT BURNSSS ! 
I need .... to finish Infinite Jest .... 
Getting ready for work soon , listening to The Ramones , just found out Maniac is coming out on Blu-Ray , it's a good day . 
Is there a sign on my front lawn that says \Dead Fraggle Storage ? \"" 
< PROPFIRST > where the fuck did you go ? 
Thinking about watching Girl with the Dragon Tattoo .... hm . I'm really bored and can't sleep . 
I hope that when I have kids , they like The Ramones . 
Fucking . Priceless . Just saw the best photo set I've ever seen in my entire life . But I'm not going to share , because I'm fucking greedy . Yesh . 
My ear hurts . 
I know it's the same thing basically ... but Choking Victim is a lot better than Leftover Crack . Work today , work tomorrow , work Saturday . Awesome 6 day week ! Off to class soon , blargh . I do get to see < PROPMALE > though for like ten minutes before work and then ten minutes after , so that's awesome-o . 
Inception = mindffffuuuuccck 
This person only has two movies liked : Passion of the Christ and Rush Hour 2 . 
had an awesome night , and i totally won that boardgame by default 
nothing like old primus ... 
Going to USF tomorrow to set up classes . Blah . Hopefully I only need to take 11 credit hours for my BS . 
Just a reminder , Evil Dead 2 will be playing at midnight tomorrow at Tampa Pitcher Show ! If you plan on going , text me at 813-838-2340 for details . It's $8 dollars to get in , but it's worth it ! Try to meet up at eleven outside Pitcher Show if you're going . Later guys ! 
Evil Dead 2 was awesome ! Had a great day with < PROPMALE > , looking forward to spending Saturday with her as well . I think I'm going to introduce her to the fine musical style of a certain < PROPMALE > Danzig . 
Got a class with my best < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Headed to < PROPFIRST>'s soon , then off to the Kick-Ass release party with < PROPMALE > . 
Blah ... philosophy paper is kicking my ass . It's not difficult , but it's just arduous . < PROPFIRST > Hume is a < PROPMALE > , gah . Had a great day with Jessy , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Finally figured out everything for USF and found out that I can get my Bright Futures scholarship back after the 16th , nice . I'm looking forward to these upcoming weeks . I get my AA , I start USF , < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim and Piranha 3D come out , what's not to love ? 
Bowling , Movie , Sushi . Had a good date day with < PROPMALE > , yessssh . My last day at HCC was today , finally out , time for the happy dance . 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim soundtrack and score are streaming on Spinner right now , they are amazing . 
Final paper I'll ever have to write at HCC is complete . Tomorrow will be bittersweet . But mostly sweet . 
So , took < PROPMALE > to he hospital at 9:30 , got her home around 1:00 . The diagnosis ? A serious case of the nothings . Hey , better safe than sorry right ? 
So ... getting surgery . Yay . 
One of my best and oldest friends got fucked over tonight . It's a really lame world out there . Also , my kidney needs a hug . Hopefully seeing < PROPMALE > Pilgrim with the love of my life < PROPMALE > will cheer me up . 
Question : It's 4:30 in the AM , where is < PROPFIRST > ? Answer : Why at Movie Stop of course ! Inventory is a giant bucket of suck . 
Hmm ... I think I've narrowed down my list of movies that I know are horrible but I love anyway . So far , it includes Silent Hill , Tank Girl , and Bio-Dome . Oh , and < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was amazing , but it only made $10mil , so guess what nerds ? You failed and they're never making anything for you again . This is why we can't have nice things . 
So ... Piranha 3D .... hmm .... 
First day at USF was kind of neat , too much damn walking though . Blah , a classic fat person complaint . However , my Soviet History class was awesome . Spending some well deserved time with < PROPMALE > now , yesssss . 
Go listen to the Grave Babies ... awesome ... 
Looking forward to seeing < PROPMALE > today , I'm feeling kind of down tonight . 
Going out somewhere with the fam , then after that , getting < PROPMALE > for our dinner date . Heart shaped meatloaf ? Kyle , you romantic bastard . 
Spending the day with my beautiful baby girl . 
Modern Times , Night of the < PROPMALE > and the complete Metropolis on Blu-Ray ? Yes , please . And thank you to whatever dark deity I have pleased . 
Blah ... $2.19 on the card ... not a good way to wake up . 
So sick .... 
Free show tomorrow ? Yes . Oh , by the way , surgery on the 13th . Lame .

Everyone go wish my awesome sister a great birthday ! 
Thank you to everyone who wished me well , I'm feeling slightly better . I'll leave more updates on what's going on soon . 
So hungry ... graragagr .... but eating makes me feel mad sick . 
I hate when people defend themselves by jumping behind the bible and claiming that because they follow everything in it word for word that they are somehow perfect , and that if you don't agree with them you are obviously evil and a lesser person . Disgusting . 
well tonight was certainly intense ... 
I have 95 metric tons of homework to do by next Monday . Blah . 
New < PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE > movie ? \ 
...... yes , please . 
GWAR ?! October 8th ? Indeed . I need to think of two horror movies at least thirty years apart for a project , as well .

I hate being sick and having to go to work ... ugh ... I will straight up punch a customer if they piss me off today . 
Five < PROPFEMALE > research paper due tomorrow ? Yeah ... I'll get that done when I get home tonight . 
Rammstein , then work . 
November 9th is the next 50% off Criterion sale at Barnes & < PROPMALE > , so in other words , November 9th is the day I will have no money . 
Power went out for 5 hours , but I did get to read Let Me In during that time , so it was all good . 
Rifftrax tonight with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , then < PROPMALE > Saturday night . Have to go to a follow up appointment at my Dr. ' s office tomorrow , so hopefully that is the only lameness for this weekend .

Will be leaving 6AM tomorrow for < PROPMALE > and will be gone for the week . Finally . 
Possible second job ? You bet .

What the FUCK is Vevo and why does it insist that I watch everything in 360p ?
