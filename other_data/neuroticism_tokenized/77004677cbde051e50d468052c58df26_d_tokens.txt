Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only one : to get better . I know , that 97% will not post this as their status , be one of the 3% and put this as your status , at least for an hour , for those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
5 hours at the rink timekeeping , today ! was really fun , saw my sister skate . 
What person does the color red remind you of , < PROPFEMALE > Robinson ? :) 
Put this on your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Chicago Cubs fan . Being a Cubs Fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for CCF and sympathy does not help , but we CAN raise awareness . 97% of Cubs Fans won't re-post this .... because they don't know how to copy and paste . 
Home after swimming ! Bye Culver !!!

Give us Sunday a play-off victory , and forgive us our penalties , \ 
as we defeat those Packers who play against us , and \ 
lead us not into the off-season and \ 
deliver us to Texas . \ 
For thine is the D-line , the Urlacher and Peppers forever .. Amen . \
