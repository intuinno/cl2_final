MORNING FOCUS\ 
I awaken in the Knowing that everything I create and experience this day is Love , \ 
Appreciation , Perfect Support , no matter what story I could make up . \ 
I feel deep and ever expanding appreciation for myself as Creator of those experiences\ 
and for the experiences themselves , , and I\ 
unconditionally accept them as they are . \ 
I am committed to an expanding awareness and direct experience of who I really am . 
Very strange . I had a friend request from fb in my email , and when I clicked on the name the link sent me to the msg < PROPFEMALE > that has msgs about upcoming events that I've been invited to . When I did a search on this person with fb , she wasn't recognized as a person on fb ? Scam ? shy ? what ? Anyone know about this type of scam ? 
Children\ 
with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and \ 
it's not contagious . They want what we all want - to be accepted . 
Gawd I hope it WARMS UP SOON !

Attention friends in Mesa County . The county had a system update and the IT company that contracted the work accidentally posted everything over the internet for a couple of days decrypted . So if you've had any dealings with the county , you need to call and ask them what to do . This isn't a joke or prank . 
Score ! New work jacket to replace the rag I was wearing , Avatar with 3 hrs of extra's . Yay , nice !
