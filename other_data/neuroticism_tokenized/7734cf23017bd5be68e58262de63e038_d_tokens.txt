I'm a man of wealth and taste\ 
I've been around for a long , long year\ 
Stole many a mans soul and faith\ 
\ 
And I was ' round when Jesus Christ\ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain\ 
Made damn sure that Pilate\ 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate\ 
Pleased to meet you\ 
Hope you guess my name\ 
But what's puzzling you\ 
Is the nature of my game 
Was it me , or did the Black Eyed Peas fucking suck ? Then again , they always sucked .

Fight Club ... for the first time .

Catch your dreams before they slip away \ 
Dying all the time \
