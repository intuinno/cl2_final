Happy Thanksgiving everyone . 

back to flying the angry lawnmowers 
FamilyLink.com is not safe , it has malware so do not use it . 
Hey Geltzau , I just found out I have a new neighbor . You may remember her . Chocolate pudding with a < PROPFEMALE > on top ! 
Ok , I don't know which member of my family is still trying to use familylink , but it's malware . Stop ! 
It can has be PFE tiem now . 
Well the instructor course is finally done . That was a month of hell I don't wish to deal with again . 
Nice . When you use the Soundcloud link , keep in mind the tracks are in reverse order . To answer the obvious question , no , I have idea why it comes up backwards . 
Thank you for all the birthday posts ! :)
