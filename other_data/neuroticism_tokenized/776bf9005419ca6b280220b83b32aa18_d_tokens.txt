Okay , so today during sectionals I was leaning on the door to the tenor's room , in an attempt to cover up the window so that my sopranos would actually concentrate on their music when Conner opened the door .

It was hilarious , but I'm starting to feel the headache :P

Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . \ 
Love never fails .

You know I've had my share\ 
But I've climbed the mountain , I've crossed the river\ 
And I'm almost there , I'm almost there\ 
I'm almost there ! \ 
Yes indeedly folks , I'm almost done with my room , so maybe next weekend I'll actually be able to socialize !!! :D Yay ! 
I know what it takes to move on\ 
I know how it feels to lie\ 
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new\ 
Holding on to what I haven't got ! \ 
Linkin Park needs to come out from under the radar more often ! I LOVE this song !!! :D 
\I brought you into this world and I can take you out . \ " ~ Melissa Dugan Selters Yet despite all the times I have dragged my mother through my own trials and tribulations I still stand here today . Thank you mom for putting up with me and all my problems ... You of all people know how much of a hassle I am ... :) " 
\You can enjoy anything if you make up your mind to . \ " ~ Joyce Meyer " 
Prom was scheduled during our choir trip !!!! :'( That means no senior prom for me ... \ 
Yes there is a choice between the choir trip or staying for prom but you've got to think about it :\ 
Prom with a date or Prom with friends in Vegas ? :P At least Mrs. < PROPFEMALE>'s going to let us bring our dresses and everything . I'm sure we'll find a way to make it amazing lol :D 
Legends remember your dance shoes for tomorrow !!! :D We finally get to perform with our beautiful new flats !!!! :D 
Knight Life :\ 
< PROPFIRST > the Latte Boy- Solo\ 
Because of You- with Hannah\ 
Teenage Dream- with Chloe\ 
This is gonna be the best knight life EVER !!! :D 
Wow , I actually managed to do my hair for winter ball in two hours !!! :D That's exciting :D Usually my hair for dances take me about three hours :S 
I hate turning down dates ... :( I feel like such a mean and horrible person now ! 
I love seeing random people like < PROPFIRST > Quillen while driving !!! It makes my day :P <3 you < PROPFIRST > !!! :D

I love having a car so I can just get up and leave . No Espanol para mi hoy ! I just don't feel like it ... 
Waiting for my interview with < PROPMALE > University ... I hope all goes well :) I just wish it was a face to face interview not a phone interview ... I suck at those :P 
Honestly I don't care if my sketches are no good , I don't care if my singing sucks , and I don't care if my writings will never make it further than my notebook . < PROPMALE > isn't about fame . It's about expression and enjoyment . It's about living in the moment and enjoying it while it lasts . 
Needs a massage .... 
I hope my day gets better :)) 
I hate my life :( Today my parents and my brother went out to celebrate his birthday and I missed all of it . :'( First I couldn't find the present I wanted to get my brother and then I go to an interview at DQ and end up staying there for a freakin ' 3 1/2 hours !!!! :( First they interviewed me and then they had me go step by step through their so called \process\ " :/ " 
I threw away my childhood today :( It was a very sad moment for me . Why , oh why did I have to treat all of my Barbies so badly ? I couldn't even see them being donated after all they'd been through . 
Dear ______ , \ 
I ____ you . You have a nice ______ . You make me _______ . You should _______ . Someday I will ______ . You + me = ________ . If I saw you now I’d __________ . I want to ________ you . I would build a _______ just for you . If I could sing you any song it would be _________ . We could ___________ under the stars . \ 
Love , \ 
_______________\ 
( P.S. ______________ . ) 
We are all crazy . Every person you read about in the history books had some kind of ‘disorder’ , they just knew how to use it . 
Happy birthday little bro ! I seriously can't believe you turned 11 today ... you're getting too old !!! 
Pretty pretty please , don't you ever ever feel\ 
Like you're less than perfect\ 
Pretty pretty please , if you ever ever feel like you're nothing\ 
You are perfect to me ! 
I just talked to Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > , there will be no Legends rehearsal tomorrow because of the 2 hour delay :) 
was going to go to bed at 9 pm , but now that there is a 2 hour delay she's staying up for two more hours ^^ 
I love how I can manage to get college stuff done while being on Facebook ... I feel so accomplished !!! 
It has been confirmed . No school tomorrow !!! :D 
EVERYDAY , I fight back the urge to text you or talk to you , telling myself that if you wanted to talk to me , YOU WOULD . 
5 Day WEEKEND !!!!!!! :D 
So my family and I were going to go out when the power shut off , but luckily the power came right back on before we left the house ... Yes I said lucky because even though we were going out to have fun we would have come back to a house ablaze ... reason ? We would have left the burners on :S

Hey all my choir peoples ! < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday is on July the 4th ... do you think enough of us would be here in Las Cruces to give her a 16th birthday party ??? 
Judging from what the El Paso Electric company looks like ( well , from what I could see from the local news report ) we may not have school for a while yet , unless they can get their act together ... I'm not sure whether I should be happy about that or not :| 
Has a burst water pipe in the backyard ... lovely ... just lovely ... :/ 
“You're only given a little spark of madness . You mustn't lose it . ” 
Is it weird that when I get older and marry I WANT my man to have a man cave ? That way he can have all his friends over and not bother me ... 
Hey choir kids , put aside about 10-15 minutes today and just work on your choir music :) Listen to it while on Facebook , look through it when you're waiting for the next notification , you know , all that fun stuff ;D It doesn't take much and you know Mrs. < PROPFEMALE>'s going to be flustered when we get back to school :) 
Just got home from seeing Wicked and having a fun time out with mom :) 
Wow , that was fast ... one touchdown already ? :O 
They brought USHER !!!!!!!!!!! :D 
Has been watching old super bowl commercials instead of the game :S Oooops ;P 
Glee's comin ' on baby !!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D It's time for Thrills ;D 
Glee should be the halftime show next year lol :D 
What’s the biggest misperception people have about you ? People often , at first glance , think that I'm a snobbish girl who only cares about herself :) 
Doesn't really want to go to the Valentines Day dance ... any choir kids wanna do something ? :P 
I freakin ' LOVE Legends !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D 
I'm sorry to those of you who have said that you can't see my photos . I've checked and double checked my privacy settings and have even tried putting a link for them into the Facebook coding but have failed ... If anyone has any ideas they would be appreciated , I've run dry :/ 
is starting to love homeroom ... they should have more of them in the mornings so that I don't have to go ^^ 
I love strawberries , mangoes , peaches , and pineapples all topped with just a pinch of sugar ^^ 
< PROPMALE>'s birthday present came in !!!!! Yay !!!! Now he can add Jeep tours , elevated paths and all that good stuff to his zoo lol on Zoo Tycoon 2 
Ready for the weekend :)) 
Had a great time last night with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Pyle , < PROPFIRST > Miller , < PROPFIRST > Hall , < PROPFEMALE > Mann , < PROPFIRST > Casillas , and < PROPFIRST > Miller ^^ 
Tomorrow is Valentines Day !!!!!!!!!! Spread the l ? ve !!!! :D I'm excited , Legends gets to start on \You Can't Stop the Beat\ " tomorrow ! ^^ " 
What a wonderful start to the Grammy Awards , I think I'm starting to forgive < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera for her Superbowl flop .... 
Seeing < PROPFEMALE > Mills at Walmart was worth standing in line for 20 minutes and missing most of the Grammy Awards show ^^ 
I don't get why everyone hates Valentines Day . I'm always single on Valentines day and I still think that it's one of the best holidays ever ! :D Maybe I just like that mushy stuff or something , I think it's cute lol :P 
Who is Arcade Fire and who is < PROPFEMALE > Spalding ??? :O 
Now will I end up making $50 in braided bread sales or $20 in braided bread sales ? Unfortunately I'm betting on the $20 but it all depends on the other people in choir :/ 
I hate that when I actually take the time to wash my face with appropriate face cleansers instead of just with water it breaks out on me :/ Grrrrr , the curse of having a normal skin type .... 
<3 ' s hot dudes who < PROPFEMALE > out and flirt with cashiers during NMSU basketball games ... especially when I'm one of the cashiers ;P 
I don't know why but I'm super excited about doing this senior album ... I think it's because I love doing something for Mrs. Temple ... I love scrapbooking and haven't been able to do it in FOREVER ... and it's a musical scrapbook !!! :D 
Time for another 5 day weekend :D 
Legends people ... We will have practice at Gold Medal Tae Kwon Do from 9-12am on Monday :) Address : 519 E Boutz Rd , Las Cruces , NM 88001 ( It's at the same intersection as Las Cruces High)\ 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Boone & Christian Hernandez ;P 
Is it weird that I like standing in front of the mirror belting out < PROPFEMALE > Spears and coming up with hairography after blow drying my just washed hair ? :P 
?????????????? ????? ?????????????? \ 
? ? If you have an amazing Mom , put this as your status ? ? \ 
??????????????? ????? ?????????????? 
Going out to sell braided bread , I hope I get sales today :/ 
Is sitting at home bored waiting for a < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > Miller later tonight ... Wally World here we come ! It's gunna be fun ! :D 
Finally getting a haircut on Monday :D I've been waiting for this lol 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Powell for coming with me to get some much needed shopping done :P 
Is up trying to fix her camera * tear * 
Might ... just might get her poetry responses done before Wednesday night :S 
Heehee ... that's the second time today someone has been surprised when I told them I was graduating from high school and not college :D I feel special ;P lol 
Hair has officially been cut ;P 
\Kind words are the music of the world . \ " ~ F . W . Faber " 
All my life I've been good but now I'm thinking what the hell ... 
* breath in - breath out * I think I'm going to stick my nose into Crime and Punishment until this recent storm blows over ... maybe I'll do a couple extra Poetry Responses too ... I'm such a rebellious teenager :/ 
Life is just so precious ... Even though I don't know you < PROPFIRST > I wish you the best for you and your family ... Please ... please get better ... 
Anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out ? :) 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > Moreno for a nice night of procrastination , dumbbells , dance , and laughter I really enjoyed it ! :D

An armed robbery , school lock-down and disappearing choir students made for a very interesting day ... 
I have been inspired to do a new profile picture ... only now I don't have a camera to do it with .... we'll see what I can do lol 
Time to start working on the swimsuit body . I'm happy to say that I've kept a pretty firm stomach and I still have a tan ! But it's time to get the muscles back :D 
Sing with me , sing for the year , sing for the laugh , sing for the tears , sing with me , if it's just for today . Maybe tomorrow , the good lord will take you away . \ 
dream on , Dream On , DREAM ON !!!! 
Singing with the Uni Singers was amazing :D And I looooooove you < PROPFEMALE > Guo you are suuuuch a beautiful singer all my friends were awestruck :D 
I'm sorry now to say that I never got to know you but be as it may you were still a knight which means that you were family . Rest in peace < PROPFIRST > , we all love you and will miss you terribly . <3 :) 
Has nothing to do on a Saturday night .... loooooovely :/ 
Just played Somebody to love on the trumpet ... Haha , you might say , I miss the buzz lol :P Although I wish I had played it on the trombone :/ I miss that instrument ... 
This week was turmoil , hopefully next week will put a smile back onto everyone's faces ... 
Every time I find the meaning of life I change it , this is what keeps me smiling at the world around me every day , because I see it in a new light ... \ 
The winds are finally changing and I can't wait to catch a ride ... 
Whoop , whoop .... Snow , baby , snow !!!! 
It's funny , I'm on Facebook all the time but then again I'm not ... :P I keep it open in my browser and do all the things I need to do at my desk then when I see the little ( 1 ) I open Facebook up , respond and get back to what needs to get done :P 
Whoooooo Toy Story 3 !!! :D 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > I want to marry your voice ... please ? Pretty , pretty please ??? 
< PROPFEMALE > Sepe , Sorry that I gave you a scare with the Linkin Park music , I know that it is rather depressing and that it hints at some dark aspects but believe me I'm as happy and cheerful as a lark :) It was merely a coincidence that two of their songs were mentioned on the ABC's note ( I was listening to my MP3 player according to artists and was there ) I only have those two songs on my MP3 player ... 
18th birthday party , I can't decide whether to have a murder mystery with 7 friends or a B-B-Que with Choir Kids ... \ 
I guess the only reason I'm thinking about the murder mystery is so that we all can have something to do ... then again I guess I'm more worried about my parents freaking out about how crazy the choir kids are .... hmmmmmm what to do ? Any ideas ??? 
Blueberry :P 
Hmmmm , I'll be free most of the night tomorrow night ... anyone want to do something ? :D 
Has finally bought the karaoke tracks for A Heart Full of Love , Teenage Dream , Because of You and < PROPFIRST > the Latte Boy ... now it's time to memorize ^^ 
Troubadors got a 1++ , a 1+ , and another 1+ at Large Group !!! Whoop , Whoop !!!!!! Great Job guys !!! Next stop .... * drumroll * VEGAS !!!!!!!!! :D 
\I want that one ! It's got three hot guys and < PROPFEMALE > Hathaway on it ! \ " -Me at Barnes and < PROPMALE > as we rush by the magazine racks ... "

Gets to see all my Capitan buddies tomorrow !!!!!!! :D Yay !!!!!!! I'm excited ^^ 
Saw < PROPFIRST > Crowder II today and got to say hello to the Capitan Band !!!!!!! You guys did really good , I hope that you qualify for state :D 
Because of a lovely Coinstar machine I now have only $56.24 left to go to get a new camera ... Yay !!!!!!! :D I'm gonna get there ^^ 
Find a little time for yourself every day . Give yourself a manicure , do a few crunches , look up a new way to do your hair . Improve yourself little by little and you'll find that you feel better about yourself . What you feel is best for you varies , but make sure that you do it ! 
The real trouble with reality is that there's no background music ;D 
Essays are like skirts .... \Long enough to cover the subject short enough to make it interesting . \"" 
Music+ice cream+sun = I am soooo ready to go out and tan ^^ 
Wow , I've been doing a lot of quizzes lately ... sorry guys for filling up your pages !!!! I'll stop now lol ;P 
Oh < PROPMALE > Mis how I miss you * sigh * And I have to say that that < PROPMALE > brother is makin a hell of a Marius :D 
Haha , Easy A was such a cute movie :D Gosh , I'm sooooo glad I haven't had any problems with rumors in school , I would DIE !!! 
I loooooooove thinking , it's sooo much fun ! It's like a massage for your brain * sigh * 
I wish I had guts , maybe then I'd tell you to your face about my feelings , but no ... I've got to post it through a Facebook status so that you can sit there and wonder if I'm talking about you . 
I hope my knee is better by tomorrow , but if it isn't I'm not , I repeat . AM NOT wearing heels tomorrow lol 
Might be going and seeing Tangled for a fourth time tomorrow ... or is it a fifth ;P What can I say , I love the plot #1 , love the music #2 , it's only a dollar #3 , and if I do go see it I'll be seeing it with a fun friend #4 :D ( P.S. Usually I don't obsess over movies and I'm not obsessing over this one yet , I just keep on taking friends to see it and haven't gotten tired of it yet lol ) 
Did you know ? \ 
The true formal name of the famous statue standing in New York harbor is not ‘The Statue of < PROPFEMALE > ” . It was named ” < PROPFEMALE > Enlightening the World” by its sculptor < PROPMALE > Bartholdi , who fashioned the statue’s likeness after his mother . 
I love Analicia :D Even though my plans for tonight got changed she was there to make it interesting again ... A fun girls night here I come !!! 
Had an amazing night . Went to see Tangled for only a $1 with Analicia , got to flirt with a cuuute concessions guy , and queued the movie lines lol Then driving home just happened to have a < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Pyle driving right in front of me so we all went to go get ice cream at Pic Quik ;D Then the night ended with Circus by < PROPFEMALE > Spears , only the most amazing song ever ! Wow ... all in only three hours :D 
\I think he likes me\ " \ 
Haha , I wish that all the guys I'm even kind of close to didn't < PROPFEMALE > out in packs , weren't always busy , or weren't going to NMMI lol ( < PROPMALE > Castillo !!! :D ) Then I might actually get to have some fun with a guy every once in a while ... You know , even a girl gets sick of makeup , perfume , and dresses sometimes ... not always dresses ... but you get the point lol 
Hey good luck all you college people with your midterms ! :) I'm sure you'll be fine but remember to breathe !!! I find that it's very hard to concentrate when you have to focus on keeping your airways open and on your test ;P 
It's going to be suuuuuch a long day tomorrow :( Hopefully I'll get through it all but waking up at 3:30 in the morning isn't a good way to start off the day lol 
I really need to find me a man to cuddle with lol I felt so alone tonight ! All my friends had cuddle buddies at the movie night except for me , and I must say , although a pillow is rather comfortable it's kind of sad when you realize that the only reason it's warm is because of YOUR body heat ... 
C'mon Onate ! You can do it !!!!!!!!! :D 
We won !!!!!!!!!! Final score : 54-48 Go KNIGHTS !!!!!!!!! :D 
I love how many of my friends think that it's weird that I would be okay with dating a guy who could only see me about once a week because he's always busy . It seems that they fail to realize that 
Official score : 4 to 16 I do believe that I win in the blondness scale ... dear me ... what shall I do with myself lol I have now officially watched Tangled 6 times and have memorized the script ! Yay !!!!! ;P 
I think my favorite song in Tangled is still \Mother Knows Best-Reprise\ " It's sooo creepy that it's amazing ... " 
You set it again , my heart's in motion\ 
Every word feels like a shooting star\ 
I'm at the edge of my emotions\ 
Watching the shadows burning in the dark\ 
I'm ~ Terrified 
I don't think that crap is holy , but I'll say it anyways ... Holy Crap !!! I'm going to be 18 in 3 days !!!!!!! When I was little I never thought that I could ever be this old , and now that I'm here I'm starting to wonder how I could ever be that young ... 
I know this is a little late but happy pi day !!! If anyone hasn't ingested a slice of pie today remember that Village Inn is open 24/7 ! 
Everything in life happens for a reason so live it , learn it , and love it . Use your smile to change the world , don't let the world change your smile ! 
I always get the worst of lyrics stuck in my head ... such as a certain section from Rihanna's S&M :P I remember getting a few weird looks when < PROPFEMALE > Mann and I walked down the hall singing that part over and over again lol 
Going out to perform with Legends ... I looooove my choir peoples :D 
Always believe that others have the ability to change , but don't let it cripple your judgment if they use you again . Learn to walk away . 
Who says\ 
Who says you're not perfect\ 
Who says you're not worth it\ 
Who says you're the only one that's hurting\ 
Trust me \ 
I'm no beauty queen\ 
I'm just beautiful me ... 
This is bad ... very very bad ... I have become addicted to ( wait for it ) ice cream ... :P I guess this means a longer daily workout session oh the horror !!! 
Just got caught up on Glee ... I think they should write their own songs more often ^^ * sigh * :D 
I love how it's a proven fact that children will go to sleep faster for strangers than they will for someone they know . It makes babysitting so much easier . My little 1 year old , < PROPFIRST > , has been having a hard time with the time change , but I was able to get him to sleep in less than ten minutes ^^ 
is armed with her GREEN crayons and ready to color your world . Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day !!! 
Okay so now I have the song from Peanuts stuck in my head , which is a good thing btw ... thanks Mesilla Valley Teen Singers lol aka < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hammock and Zel Hartman 
^^ This is my first post on the brand new HP Laptop my parents bought me ... I love birthdays * sigh * :D 
Just got to talk to my bestie friend in Oregon < PROPFEMALE > SULLIVAN through Skype ... It tis a miraculous thing skype is lol 
just got skype ! Send me your skype names if you feel like it ! :P lol 
Thank you all you 79 guys who told me happy birthday today :) I really appreciated it ^^ It made my day :D 
Oooooh , what a beautiful mask . ^^ It was soooo worth $30 :D 
Spring Break is finally here :D 
Haha , tonight was fun . Although it wasn't quite as fast as the party I was expecting it was still fun and full of great food lol Thank you to those who came ! And thank you < PROPFIRST > Miller for saving the night lol 
With the help of Analicia I have just ordered my new camera ^^ Eeeeek I'm sooo excited ! :D It should get here towards the end of spring break 
' s eatin ' oreos ^^ lol 
Heehee ... I'm in suuuuch a good mood right now and I don't even know why , I'm just smiling ear to ear and hopping around like a newborn ... not that they do that ... anyways :D 
Today was perfect\ 
Got up early and caught up on Bones\ 
Went to the mall with Analicia , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > G\ 
Bought my scent , Dark Kiss , which Ive almost run out of . So thanks Analicia for the money ! \ 
I bought two books by < PROPMALE > Dekker , a fav author of mine . Im going to have fun the rest of break reading them thanks to the amazing Joseph\ 
Now Im at Tylers just chillin and havin a perfect ending to a wonderful day 
Hey , it's Analicia . i decided to hack onto Linday's profile .... i feel like a total fail right now cause everyone is trying to corrupt me and its not working . they are trying to teach me how to lie and i can't even do that :/ EPIC FAIL !!!!!!! 
I just love it when I have family issues . :/ Ugggh at least I understand ... Parents are stressed about their baby leaving home , mom's trying to relax during spring break , and I'm not helping by constantly having things I want to do :( I should probably thank them for not being the kind of parents who would kick their child out on their 18th birthday ... :) 
I love how according to Bath and Body works survey and < PROPFEMALE>'s magnificent nose , my scent is Dark Kiss ... Why do I love this ??? It's my favorite scent from there and the one that I already wear almost daily ^^ 
Was up at 7 this morning , but at least I now officially have my drivers license ( So everyone had better watch out ;P jk ) \ 
P.S. Does anyone know who's hiring here in Las Cruces ? 
I feel great ! \ 
We're on Spring Break\ 
I'm 18\ 
I'm seeing sunlight\ 
My horoscope is telling me negative things ( I always set out to prove those things wrong lol)\ 
I got my drivers license\ 
I have amazing friends\ 
I just got a new computer\ 
I just got new books to read\ 
I'm getting a new camera\ 
I get to work on my robot\ 
Even if I don't get into < PROPMALE > NMSU is still a really good last option :D \ 
Life is good ^^ 
So family issues may be putting a damper on Spring Break but I'm still grinning ear to ear ... there's only one thing that could make it better . And those of you who know me well enough ( or who are just up to date lol ) already know what that is ... soooooooooooooo ... ^^ 
Heehee ... playing Mafia ( Not the game on facebook , but in semi real life lol ) is soooo much fun ! Especially with a group of dramatic Christians :D Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Mann for inviting me and thank you < PROPMALE > Castillo for coming !!! I loved seeing you ... :D ( Even if I did try to kill you off once or twice lol ) 
Should I stop doing happy status' ? I feel like I'm being waaaaaaayyyyy too ecstatic lately lol and it is completely uncalled for !!! :P

Welcome to real life Linday ! 
It's a good night\ 
To be out there soakin ' up the moonlight\ 
Stake out a little piece of shoreline\ 
I've got the perfect place in mind\ 
It's in the middle of nowhere only way to get there\ 
You got to get a little mud on the tires\ 
And then with a little luck \ 
we might just get stuck\ 
Let's get a little mud on the tires 
Heehee ... I just had to pick up one of my parents because THEY didn't have a car ^^ That was the moment of my life lol 
Don't worry this isn't about suicide or anything that will harm me physically ... just quite possibly emotionally ... \ 
This is bad ... this is very very bad ... I'm about to do something really stupid ... * crap*\ 
Someone please just tell me no ... 
Kinda , really hopes that she's put last in the Knight Life show :D * crosses fingers * 
Strawberries !!! Oh how I have missed you :D 
Haha , I love < PROPFEMALE > Mann's family !!!! :D They're amazingly weird lol 
Goin ' out to live up the night with < PROPFIRST > !!! Auuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh :D 
#1 You are amazingly cute with those blue eyes\ 
#2 You flirt with me and I'm all smiles around you\ 
#3 I would be afraid of dating you\ 
Why you ask ? Your mother is like my mother , in other words it would be like I was dating my long lost brother\ 
And yes . That is a problem ... 
Guess who I kissed ! ^^ Heehee ... :D 
Just because you can only see one set of footprints in the sand doesn't mean God left you , it means God carried you . 
Why does the internet have to start failing me now ???? It's fading in and out and I'm trying to finish important documentation ... grrrrrrrrrrr 
Kiss me , infect me with your loving , fill me with your poison\ 
Take me , wanna be your victim , ready for abduction ......... \ 
~~~~~~?~?~?~?~ Extra-Terrestrial ~?~?~?~?~~~~~~

There will be food , a water fight , and lots of laughs so if you know < PROPMALE > and can come please do ! Message me if you want more information ;P 
Goin ' out on a date with my brother ^^ I love that little guy :D 
Today I woke up feeling okay about things . Then someone mentioned your name , tears sprung up and that hurt in my heart exploded inside shattering my heart again ... \ 
School , I can't wait to be done with you . 
Gets to face the anger of Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow :( Why do I have to get a job ? 
I always have music flings and right now for the first time in my life I'm on a country fling ... I blame you < PROPFEMALE > McEntire ( And < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > for supplying me with songs ) lol Country is so amazing !!!! 
I love my choir family . Mrs. < PROPFEMALE > is definitely a mother figure to me and every single one of the choir kids , especially those in Legends or Troubadours hold a special place in my heart . I will never ever forget you guys :) I can't believe that my last trip with the choir is less than a month away :/ 
Is finally back to writing her novel . Time is such a precious thing * sigh * :D 
Got her car back !!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY !!!!!! :D 
Yes , I did just walk up to a guy in college and tell him that he had a pretty face . It's just something that I do . 
Knight Life is tomorrow * knees start knocking * Oooooooh boy .... 
Knight Life was amazing and I was so happy with my performance on < PROPFIRST > the Latte Boy . Teenage Dream could have been better on my behalf although < PROPFEMALE > did AMAZING and as always Somebody to Love freaked me out ... anyways ... on to next week and Show Fest .... :S 
Is still in the running for first in State at the botball tournament wish us luck !!! 
I'm serious ... if you bring me java you will bring me joy ... Especially if it's a java chiller from Sonic \ 
Sorry Starbucks , < PROPFIRST > decided to switch allegiances :) 
Mmkay so < PROPFIRST > and I didn't win first but we did win 3rd overall in State ( Which qualifies us for nationals ) , 2nd in the Seeding Round ( Programming and Engineering ) , and the Judges Choice award :D Which is exciting ^^\ 
Too bad nationals is during the choir trip :/ I guess I'll just have to program and hear the results from < PROPFIRST > :) 
Did anyone happen to record < PROPFIRST > the Latte Boy last night ? I would really like a copy of it if you did :D 
It's National Book Week\ 
The rules : Grab the closest book to you . Go to < PROPFEMALE > 56 . Copy the 5th sentence as your status . DON'T mention the book . Post these rules as part of your status\ 
\Tingling nerves shot out around her waist and began to squeeze her breathless . \"" 
Has decided after careful consideration that she will be going to NMSU , Carnegie Mellon looks great but I don't think it's for me . Go Aggies !!! 
This is the time of year where I double check that my obsessive heel wearing problems didn't screw up my back ... How do I do this ? I start obsessively wearing flip flops ^^ Yay !!! 
Has the horrible feeling that the darkness in the sky right now isn't clouds , its the ash from the fire in Ruidoso blowing in ... I hope that's not the case :( 
Country Music Awards are on !!!! :D 
Oh my gosh < PROPFEMALE > and Aerosmith were AMAZING !!! 
Hmmm , I don't know how I feel about this . I procrastinate on English homework by applying what I've learned while I read or write . English you are stalking my mind !!! 
Hmmmm , Rhianna and country lets see how this mixes ... 
Way to go < PROPMALE > Paisley and < PROPFIRST > Swift ! :D 
Sing with me\ 
Sing for the year\ 
Sing for the laughter\ 
Sing for the tears\ 
Sing with me , if it's just for today \ 
The past is gone\ 
It went by , like dusk to dawn\ 
So just dream on . \ 
Dream on\ 
Dream until your dreams come true ... 
Doesn't have a phone for the moment ... just so everyone knows :) 
Sometimes I feel like < PROPFEMALE > from The Wizard of Oz , I only attract guys who are either cowards , have no heart or are in desperate need of a brain ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Bartlett , < PROPFIRST > Garciai , < PROPFIRST > Baca and Conner Serna , thank you guys for coming and supporting us ! It was really neat to see you there :D 
It's the best feeling in the world when you race your friends down a road , win , and finally when you wave goodbye out of your window and slow down , a cop pulls out in front of you . I <3 you < PROPFEMALE > Mann ! 
Out on the < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > moors\ 
We'd roll and fall in green . \ 
You had a temper like my jealousy :\ 
Too hot , too greedy . \ 
How could you leave me , \ 
When I needed to possess you ? \ 
I hated you . I loved you , too . \ 
Bad dreams in the night . \ 
They told me I was going to lose the fight , \ 
Leave behind my Wuthering Heights . \ 
Heathcliff , it's me , Cathy . \ 
Come home . I'm so cold ! \ 
Let me in your window . 
I don't like you very much ... 
I had someone think that I was a freshman today ... Joy , I feel so mature now :/ 
Go to your profile . The top 5 friends that are in the left sidebar are now your team in the pending Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > M . \ 
A few of us will make it for at least a day , but once night falls , we're all screwed , unless < PROPFIRST > can save us all by lollerskating his way into the zombies ^^ 
It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down\ 
This place about to be blown ! \ 
Tonight we're taking over , no one's getting out \ 
Show Fest here we come ! 
Onate clean up has been canceled for today because of the high winds ... Sorry Honor Society kids ! 
There was singing , there was dancing\ 
There were hot guys , there were gay guys\ 
There were let downs , there was hope\ 
There was critique , there was praise\ 
There was a possibility , then there was defeat\ 
There was laughter , there were tears\ 
But you know what ? They can't stop the beat ... :) 
So I walk into Barnes and Nobles today to hand in my app and a cute blue eyed guy opens the door says \Let me get that for you . \ " Opens the second door for me and then winks at me on my way out . \ 
I'm getting over you ... \ 
Wow ... It took long enough ! 
Does anyone know how to convert a . rar file to . wmv ? I can't upload the 2nd showfest video until I know how :( 
It's amazing how many things you can see if you allow yourself to loose your focus for just one moment . It sounds like a bad thing . After all aren't we supposed to find a goal and lock it in to our targets ? But breathe , loose sight of that goal , just for ten minutes , open those eyes\ 
And see ... 
Yes I will be sending a graduation invitation to the white house ... and maybe one to < PROPMALE > Gates as well ... hmmmm , I must have his address somewhere ... 
Only a few months left till college\ 
Only six weeks left till graduation\ 
Only four weeks left of high school\ 
Only two weeks left till Las Vegas\ 
Time passes by , people pass on\ 
At the drop of a tear they're gone 
Stupid choir trip being during prom 
Moulin Rouge , Zombieland , a chocolate fountain , and an amazing guy all in one night ... I hope this streak of happiness continues ... :)) 
I could never ever be a doctor . The movie 127 hours has just proved that . 
This is my fifth time trying to perfect this pop up card ... This had better work or Hamlet is going down !!! 
Hey does anyone know the difference between an honors dorm and a regular dorm at NMSU ? I'm eligible for a honors dorm but I was wondering about the perks that come with it ... 
OMG !!!! Congratulations all my Capitan band peeps !!!! :D 2nd in State ? That's AMAZING !!!! :D I'm soooo proud of you all ! ^^ Especially Cade < PROPFIRST > Haynes play that trombone man !!! You rock :)) 
I was made for loving you baby , \ 
You were made for loving me . \ 
The only way of loving me baby , \ 
Is to pay a lovely fee . \ 
Just one night , \ 
Give me just one night . \ 
There's no way , \ 
Cause you can't pay . \ 
In the name of love ! \ 
One night in the name of love ! \ 
You crazy fool , \ 
I won't give in to you . \ 
Great ... now this song is stuck in my head :P Thanks < PROPFIRST > for encouraging it lol 
Why does it have to be on a Wednesday ?!?! Now I have to go to early Legends rehearsal and then back home to sleep :( Grrr ... Oh well , it'll still be fun :) 
Suddenly my internet connection has slowed down :( This sucks ... 
Is going to second period tomorrow ... :/ 
Why can't I sleep in ... why ? why ?!?!?! Now I have to wait until the rest of my senior friends get up and want to do something :( 
:O Uh oh ... today was honor society ... I have the notebooks ... I wasn't there ... :S 
I love how the best part about senior skip day was the section of the day when I went to my AP class ... I am such a nerd ... lol 
This pop up card is very interesting indeed ... I'm not sure whether or not I like it 
Okay < PROPFIRST > Casillas just give up . YOU AIN'T GOT NO PANCAKE MIX !!!!!!! 
Wants to be out and about ... but instead is in with chagrin ... :/ 
New photos Yay ! I had to amuse myself lol 
Has only cut herself twice in her life shaving ... The first was her first time ever shaving and the second was today . Ouch ... 
I could talk to you all night :) \ 
Especially when that talking is aided by free tater tots and an amazing random movie beforehand lol ;P 
Is trying to find more pictures for 1st and 4th period choir ... You guys are just as important as my 3rd period peeps !!! You need to be in the Slideshow !!! :D 
Type your name : Linday\ 
Type your name with your elbow : Likn dayh\ 
Type your name with your eyes closed : Linday\ 
Type your name with your nose : Linday\ 
Slam face into keyboard : bn\

ATTN : Choir seniors ! I need the picture(s ) you want to go in the senior album !!! I have < PROPFEMALE>'s , < PROPFEMALE>'s , < PROPFEMALE>'s , < PROPFEMALE>'s , and < PROPFIRST>'s but there's a lot more of you ! Get me those pictures or tell me to choose yours for you :) 
Is going shopping for a shawl to cover her shoulders ... Why do there have to be enhanced guidelines for the choir trip ? :'( My dress would have been fine at prom !!!!! :O 
Like my status and I'll tell you : 1 . How we met . 2 . My first impression of you . 3 . What I like about you . 4 . Favorite memory of you . 5 . But if you like this you must put it as your status 
Got a shawl for Vegas ! < PROPMALE > got into the new charter school ! And we got out of Legend's early ! Today was a good day ^^ 
I love the radio ... it reads my mind ^^ My MP3 player was dead and I really wanted to listen to my Moulin Rouge soundtrack and guess what comes on !?!?! Lady Marmalade ... a song that is on the soundtrack ... it tied me over until I got home :D 
My pear tree is coming out just like I envisioned it !!! Yay !!! 
Less than 24 hours until I leave with my fellow choirians for an amazing time in Vegas .... It's going to be timeless ;P That's for sure !!! 
Is counting down the minutes ... Could it be ? Am I actually going to Las Vegas ? I always thought if I went to Las Vegas it would be Las Vegas , NM not Las Vegas , NV lol 
Got home safely , and with all my possessions ( including underwear lol ) ... Las Vegas was sooooo amazing !!!! But the twelve hour trip was way too long ... I can't wait to sleep in my own bed again :D 
Has 650 images/videos from the Las Vegas trip ... so be patient ... they will trickle on here eventually :D 
I love it when I expect to feel regret and instead I feel satisfaction ... That wasn't a mistake ... not in my mind ... 
Time to play with fire :D I love scrapbooking ^^ 
The < PROPFEMALE > symbolizes\ 
* Hope\ 
* Clarity\ 
* Satisfaction\ 
* Contentment\ 
* Bright future\ 
And joy ... Thank you for coming and visiting me little songbird of spring ... I hope that you visit me in my mind tomorrow while I test ... I will need all the clarity I can get ... 
Can't sleep ... I have visions of characters , themes , and motifs dancing in my head ... 
Can't wait to see the cast of Working :D Lookin ' good guys !!! ^^ 
I know that this is weird , but I'm a weird person ... I freakin ' love crying , because afterward I'm always more creative !!! :D Time to work on the Senior Scrapbook !!! :D < PROPFEMALE > , your < PROPFEMALE > is gonna look freakin amyazing ( I hope ;P ) 
I hate ... I repeat ... I HATE NMSU's website ... I didn't know that I had to not only apply for housing , but that once I applied I had to hurry back on , go to yet ANOTHER link and find an available room before they were all gone ! Now I can't get into a dorm and here I was sitting on my butt waiting for a letter or an e-mail to arrive in the mail ... great ... just great ... 
Can't listen to < PROPMALE > Mar's Lazy Song without wincing ... 
Uploading Vegas pictures , listening to fabulously gaga music and washing her car ... its a good day :D 
I've been surprisingly productive today :D 
So much to do today ... I hope it can be another productive day ... :S 
I'm apologizing in advance if the senior choir slideshow looks makeshift ... why do you ask ? Because it is ... So if I forget photos and such please don't kill me I'm making do with the little time that I have ... 
Maybe if I didn't try to do five things at once on one computer my internet would be faster ... :P 
I had everything planned out to where I wouldn't fall behind ... but I guess I didn't think about all the things that people would be throwing at me last second ... time to pull an all nighter ... I hope no one wants me to be conscious tomorrow ... :( 
Project last minute power point : epic success :D 
Tomorrow is my last day in choir ... \ 
* sob * 
Water Balloons !!!!!!!!!!!!! :D That was fun , although I'm kinda sad that I missed out on being a part of it ... :/ 
Tomorrow is my last day as a highschool senior ... \ 
Wow ... \ 
It doesn't feel like it went by fast it's just the realization that the end is here that has finally hit me like a ton of bricks ... 
Finally got a scholarship !!! Although I'm only getting about $1000-$5000 ( amount yet to be announced ) I actually got one lol :D 
Although I wish I had been there to see it , I saw the aftermath . Way to go bouncy ball team !!! :D I'm really glad I got to be in on the most epic Senior prank ever !!! :P 
I'm no longer a student at Onate High School ... wow ... this feels weird ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Evans : \That's when you hear the crack . \ " \ 
I've actually had a really good day for it being the 13th ... hmmmm :P

Yes creeper my name is Denise . \ 
Yes it scares me that you followed me from the gas station to Subway . \

Good day to you and Goodbye . 
Loves it when people in love with God get far in reality shows ... Right now < PROPMALE > is taking control of American Idol and < PROPMALE > is coming back in for Survivor ... It makes me happy :D 
And he accidentally slip fall on my crack\ 
Ooops , I said on my crack\ 
I aint really mean to say on my crack\ 
But since we talking about my crack\ 
All of you haters say hi to that\ 
I'm Done ( no really though , I'm not done)\ 
Lol < PROPFEMALE > N . Ragazzone you make my day every time you post that video !!! :D 
And I can see you years from now in a bar , talking over a football game\ 
With that same big loud opinion but nobody's listening\ 
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter thing\ 
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing\ 
But all you are is mean\ 
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic and alone in life\ 
And mean , and mean , and mean , and mean 
Number 19 out of 450+ kids !!! I'm happy and satisfied ... too bad there won't be any white robes in choir this year though :( 
Hey guys !!! Looks like we won't be graduating !!! Here comes the Rapture !!! ( According to Yahoo news ) 
Is pretty sure that she's still wearing silver heels tomorrow ... it's either that or my converse take your pick Phelps :) 
All ready for graduation at nine ... I hope :P At least the after parties will be fun ! :D 
Life is good ... life is good :D 
got all registered for classes at NMSU . I now have my ID and am rooming with < PROPFEMALE > Brewer in the Honor Dorms at Monagle Hall . The only scary thing is the fact that this semester I'm getting 18 credit hours under my belt ! :S I'm taking two honors classes , an online course , an easy A course , and Pre-Calc ... Wish me luck !!! 
Tonight will never happen again . 
Hey choir kids ... I'm going to be choosing about 25 pictures tonight from my Las Vegas albums to print out and put on the board in the choir room ... so if there are any that you specifically want put up comment on the picture you want ! :) 
Is slowly fading away ... everything seems to be working out for me but my excitement is dwindling and I don't know why :) Maybe tomorrow will kick me back into gear :D 
Finally got her diploma !!! :D It's about time lol 
You ... make me sad and mad and just plain rebellious ... thanks , thanks a lot ... 
I think this was the most realistic episode of Glee ever ... I could actually relate for once !!! Putting aside boys for dreams , freaking out over being in New York and coming in close second like always ... There's always next year ! :D 
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me\ 
Distracting ... reacting\ 
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection\ 
It's haunting how I can't seem ... \ 
To find myself again\ 
My walls are closing in\ 
Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take\ 
I've felt this way before\ 
So insecure ! \ 
This has been stuck in my head all day !!! lol 
I have to wear a tacky dress ? Hmmmmmmmmmmm I'm all out of ideas ... 
is thinking about signing off from Facebook until she has a job ... Yes or No ... hmmmm I've done it before and it helped a looooooooooooooot ... 
Walking by myself I know\ 
This lonely road's becoming my new home\ 
But I don't stop , I just keep moving on and on\ 
Every day I fight it , you know it's possible ! 
lets rumors affect her way too easily ... but maybe it's for the best maybe it's time to say goodbye 
Shoes can make or break an outfit ... 
Has been so emotional lately ... sorry to everyone I freaked out I'm just going through a little bit of a rough spot but I'll get through it :) Not being around my parents for a few days has really helped :D So a lot of thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Mann I love you < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
Di Caprio never died in Titanic\

Okay so that's just plain weird when your first two sales of the day ( so far ) have each totaled out to be $9.11 .... I don't know if I like that very much ... 
I know that it's been 10 years since 9/11 and I know that I was only 8 years old when the towers fell . But the haunting photos , videos , stories and my own vivid remembrance of that day makes me hope that we never loose the reverence we feel for that day . “For the USA there will be no forgetting September 11th . We will remember every rescuer who died in honor . We will remember every family that lives in grief . We will remember the fire and ash , the last phone calls , the funerals of the children . \ " , 2011-09-11 22:46:00 " 
It's sad when your real nails are longer than the fake nails you used to put on .... :D
