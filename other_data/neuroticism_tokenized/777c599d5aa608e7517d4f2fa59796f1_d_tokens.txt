Candlejack is fucking in this hou 

Going to another party today !... I think . 
is the Devil and Messiah of the Capital Wasteland . Weird how that works out , huh ? 
is a scavenger that feeds off the stress and anger of other people . 
hates giant flying monkeys with lasers and spike guns ... FUCK 
couldn't sleep last night ... Her face haunted my dreams . 
is wondering why Myspace IM just randomly popped up and opened twenty empty chat rooms . 
Fuck . I just wasted all my printer ink . Thanks alot college . -_- 
I hate writing essays . They're fucking stupid . 
Ah , folk metal ... You are now officially my favorite genre . 
Ugh . So bored ... I sometimes hate not having school on Friday . 
Where < PROPMALE > thou , sweet Lilith of my Dreams ? 
Anybody that says Miley < PROPMALE > has good music is a troll . 
Ugh . I fucking hate texting sometimes . 
still hates essays . 
Apparently , if you cough up blood all the time , nothing bad is going to happen . 
Athiests have their own dating service now . Haha !! 
\Twilight of the Thunder God\ " - the only Amon Amarth song I can partially understand . " 
I'm nicer than < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , AND Skippy ? There's something wrong with the stupid niceness contest . 
>=( 
Hm . 
I'm starting to think I have really bad paranoia . 
Q : How can you tell if a white man is middle class ? 
is doing a research paper on the Crusades , which is fine with me . 
<3 Moonsorrow 
is enjoying some delicious turkey and gravy . <3 
Monday tomorrow . That means English 101 . =( 
Wenches and mead ! More wenches is what I need ! Ah , pirate metal . So laughable . 
writing essays and studying for finals ... That's what I should be doing . But I'm not . 
Crap . I drank mah MDs too fast . Here comes the stomach aches . Ach ... =( 
Who turned in their fiction writing assignments with ONE FUCKING MINUTE TO SPARE !? Me , that's who ! ... .. . .. ... I need to stop procrastinating . 
Now I remember why I don't play CoD games online . I don't have the fucking < PROPFEMALE > for it ! > <

Three of a kind bitch ! 
Tonight should prove to be ... Interesting . 
I stayed up until 5 for no reason this morning . Argh ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Fox sucks more < PROPMALE > in an hour than a prostitute on Black Friday . 
Great . I left my eggrolls out too long . Now they're cold . =( 
If there's anything I hate more than an emo , it's those damn Feral Ghoul Reavers . Everytime I see one ... FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu- 
What happens when you mix a giant squit with a giant pink riendeer hell bent on eating souls ? I don't really know , but it would be pretty fucking messed up . 
pirates = epic pwnage . Srsly 
I just bought myself the awesome promo Blue Eyes White Dragon . I'm now complete . :D 
Re-watching a video that has a moan off isn't a good idea when your parental figures are still nearby , especially when they got the wrong idea of what you were watching the first time around . 
I just tried listening to a Paramore song to see what the hype over < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > was all about . Her singing is mediocre at best and she looks like your average red head ( which is a hair color I don't think is very attractive on a girl ) . Everybody has their opinions I suppose . 
Here's some funny stuff from Friend Faqs : Somebody thinks I scored over 1500 on the SATs when , in fact , I have never taken the SATs . Somebody also thinks I've never cheated on a test . Oh lawdy , are they wrong . 
I was not staring at your butt ! I was admiring your back pockets . 
is getting a haircut in a few days . I'm getting tired of the white stuff all the time . 
I hate app invitations . If I want to use an app , I'll do it when I feel like it , not when somebody invites me to it . 
My wireless internet is finally on . If Xbox LIVE lags because of it , I'm going to be pissed . 
FUCKING SHIT FUCK . I wait a week for a game add-on to come out today , wake up early so I can get some MS points before school , and get home at 7PM only to find out the damn thing gets delayed . FUCK . 
First Candle < PROPFIRST > , and now Slender Man . Ugh . This is getting redicu 
Tomorrow is Monday . Wonderful . 
Eating nachos and this strangely delicious cheesey salsa stuff . 
I apparently look like < PROPFIRST > Lennin from the Beatles . 
Had an amazing and confusing dream last night . And I hate styes . 
Writing a story for fiction writing that I should have done over the weekend . 
My phone is retarded . It doesn't let me add smileys without messing them up . =( 
An emo that does hip hop and rap music just sent me a friend request . There's something wrong with that . 
There are a few things that would make today better . * wink wink * 
So tired . But I can't sleep . Ugh . 
is bored out of my mind . There's nobody to < PROPFEMALE > out with between 3 and 4 . :( 
eating < PROPFIRST > ' n ' the Box . * sigh * This day could have been so much better . 
Visits from friends at 10PM are a great way to end the weekend . 
had a fun day today . :) 
is having a surprisingly fun time defending Kelso against Vancouver's assholeiness . 
Switzerland is better than Canade because they have Swiss chocolate , Swiss cheese , Swiss banks , and better free healthcare . 
< PROPMALE > out with some friends , played more Halo 3 , went to < PROPFEMALE>'s at one in the morning , and drank more Mountain Dew . Time to pass out . 
Just downloaded the entire E Nomine discography . That's over 100 new songs and a gig and a half of epic < PROPMALE > /Latin techno/trance . And for some reason , an hour long music video that can't play on my iPod AND is all in < PROPMALE > . 
You know the world is screwed when the children are yelling at their Nintendo DS and throwing a fit when their Pokemon miss an attack . 
\Every black guy is a rapist . \ " - some TV show that was on when I walked by . " 
O_O 
Sammi : Have you heard of any good RPG games ? Me : Like what ? Sammi : < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . Me : * snicker * 
Curls always did have a strange appeal . 
Ok , so I'm following a Battlemage ... * sees blood on floor * * stops and looks up * * sees spikes on ceiling * * looks at Battlemage * The floor rises up with the Battlemage on it . Bye-bye Battlemage . -_- 
\under the branches of dead trees you sit and listen to dead birds the night leaves you believing in nothing your body shivers from the cold and you won't find your way back when your eyes get used to the dark \"" 
Tonight was epic . \Spin the kitty ! \"" 
My ears are still ringing . That means it was a good show . 
I've noticed that whenever a friend of mine is going through an emotional stage , i'm playing Halo 3 
Tonight , < PROPMALE > out with one of my best friends and the red neck . Later today ... AMON AMARTH . Live ! 
This weekend was amazingly kickass . But now I get to read the Death of < PROPMALE > Ilyich . FML 
I hate this in-depth reading shit . I should have to read something for enjoyment , not all that fucking anilytical ( did I even spell that right ? ) crap ! 
I'm pissed off and I don't even know why . Ugh . 
Chips for breakfast . Yum . 
I was out slaying vampires to accumilate a vast fortune when , to my dismay , I became one of the fowl beasts . I soon began a quest that forced my to travel the world , sent me into the depths of Oblivion , and battle a powerful vampiric lord to obtain the items neccassary to craft a cure for my unholy plight . Later , I went fishing and was almost eaten by a giant fish . 
Mmm ... Mint brownies . :D 
MTN Dew Livewire , chips ( instead of the cake that mysteriously dissapeared ... ) , Halo 3 , and KSE ... Tonight is good . Minus the part about the vanishing cake . 
If you have a problem with someone's taste in music , how about instead of complaining about it , you shut the fuck up , leave them alone , and go listen to your own damn music . 
I'm half asleep and then starled awake when I feel my entire body and bed just vibrate . It was fucking crazy . 
All I need on this strange night : my metal , my shotgun , and my purple hovercraft . 
Halo : Reach beta , mother fuckers !! 
It's a trap ! 
Once you accept it , the dark side is with you forever 
Well this day just keeps getting gayer . 
This week sucked and the weekend ain't looking much better . 
Random xbox live kid comment of the day : ' my butt hurts!!!' x6 
Note to self : Think before acting . 
Just spent the day with Pruitt and < PROPMALE > Fucking Stevenson walking down some train tracks . And spent a few minutes in a trunk . Good times . 
Good aspect of today : It's Leopold's birthday . Everything else about today can go fuck itself . 
A shitty and dissapointing weekend and six energy drinks later , I am done with my essay !... 
Sanguine , my Brother . 
Watch in horror as I rip you apart ! 
Today is Give < PROPFIRST > A New Name Day . So far I've been called < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and ... * Gag * < PROPMALE > . So bring on the new names ! 
My computer has a < PROPMALE > virus . My virus protection norton 360 didn't do crap about it . If there's anything anyone could do to help or advice , I'd appreciate it . 
Bow chika bow wow ... 
I forgot how much the orthodontist sucks . All the stuff they put in your mouth just to replace a retainer makes you feel violated . 
Lost the cable today because it was getting expensive . I don't mind but my cousins are crying over it . It's pathetic . 
Imperial Legion Soldier vs . Two Mage Guild Battlemages . Who wins ? 
Burning shit for the win . 
No better way to get out your frustration than punching stuff ... On Oblivion . 
I got my computer back . :D 
I got < PROPMALE>'s Inferno ! Finally ... Time to Go To Hell . :D 
I just checked out a book from the < PROPMALE > College library . It's due June 3rd . Today is June 9th ... -_- 
Today is the spring fling at < PROPMALE > and there's music . Some guy behind me is saying that if the song was on guitar hero , it would be an average solo ... 
\I die so that democracy may live . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Prime " 
Your cruel words hurt my manly feelings ! All one of them . 
Just burnt < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s The Family !! :D I love fire . <3 
Gear of War 3 - Awesome\ 
\ 
Fable III - Amazing\ 
Halo : Reach - Orgasmic ( space battles !! )\ 
Call of Duty : Black Ops - Video game's equivalent of the Saw movies . One gets shat out every year and nothing new happens 
Done at < PROPMALE > for the quarter ! And then I got to sit around for over an hour and do nothing because SOMEONE wasn't here like they were supposed to be . -_- 
At Prairie's graduation ! Congrats to < PROPFIRST > Kabat , Cap'n < PROPMALE > Tappan , and < PROPMALE > fucking Stevenson ! 
Also congrats to < PROPFEMALE > Doty ! The last message didn't have enough room for your name , so you're getting your own ! 
Going through BG while wearing a Slipknot mask and blasting techno while < PROPFIRST > is wearing a Japanese mask .. Thing . Good times . Good times ... 
Mass Effect 2 or sleeping . Hmm ... I'm gonna have to go with ME2 this time . 
FOR DIO !!!! 
Off to Blue Lake for the next two days ! 
While playing Xbox , my cousin is watching music vids on youtube . Looking over at them every now and then , I've concluded that emofags try too hard to be metal . 
Junk mail keeps coming for someone named < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . No one by that name lives in my house . It's very confusing . 
I just found out that while I'm the Grey Fox , I can kill as many people as I want and be completely innocent as the hero . I love Oblivion ! 
Tonight = best 4th of July EVER . 
I've got a bit to think about . 
Some kid thinks I'm wierd because I'm so quiet . Unlike the dumb kid , I don't feel the need to constantly talk about stupid things and yell for no reason . 
Had an awesome day at lewisville . Except for my feet . My feet are more or less dead right now . 
Gag me with a jagged < PROPMALE > spoon . 
I feel like I just got handed a big \fuck you . \"" 
Today wasn't a complete waste . Gotta < PROPFEMALE > with a good friend for an hour . Good times . 
Watching scary videos on youtube and reading creepypasta on /x/ when you're bored is never a good idea when you have slight paranoia . Damn me and my continuing to do this . Though other people being around making noise kills the experience . 
Blood runs deep . Fear runs even deeper . 
I just saw the cat that lives in my yard . It was staring right at me through the window . The damn thing has lived through all the snow storms , ice overs , and whatnot over the past few years . It's probably a demon cat . 
Would you die for heavy metal ? 
Ah hell , why not . Bandwagon : Like the status , tell you what I like about you , ect . 
Nothing feels better than making an illegal immigrant child get angry . 
As soon as I sat down , my video started playing . Damn , I've got good timing . 
I need/want a job more than ever now . I feel like getting me the new Xbox 360 , which is going to run $400+ . Fuck . 
All morning , I've been on youtube , listening to metal and finding new bands via the suggestion bar . Today has been good so far . 
I'm playing < PROPFEMALE > Wars : KOTOR . Nostalgia is a great thing . 
Like this status if you remember me saying \This makes me want to punch a gay black jewish baby in the face . \ " \ 
I don't know why , but it's annoying to me when you're telling someone something that happened a long time ago and that you're over it , and all they can say is \I'm so sorry that happened ! \ " I dunno . I guess they just don't know what else to say . " 
Just got done cleaning my room . Son of a bitch , it gets hot in there . 
Second rule of metal : Play it loud ! 
I come down stairs to see what ? My grandma watching N'sync music videos . That's what I get for showing her youtube . 
My grandma is giving away two 14-inch tires for a saturn . Anybody need them ? 
I keep hearing a loud buzzing sound . So I'm either going crazy or it's out there somewhere . 
I get Rickroll'd , even in my dreams . FML 
I would kill for a death metal radio station right now . 
Give them nothing , but take from them EVERYTHING !! 
I need the sci-fi guys to help me out here : I've been seeing two questions pop up lately on a forum I frequent : Halo vs . < PROPFEMALE > craft and Halo vs . < PROPFEMALE > Wars . What do you guys think ? \ 
( Halo gets its ass handed to it against both ) 
I'm home alone , the lights are off , I'm feeling slightly paranoid again . Hmm ... \ 
Creepypasta time 
Oh , internet . How boring my life would be if you did not exist . 
Has anyone heard of the mosque/community center that's being planned on getting built near Ground Zero next year ? If you have , what's your thought on it ? I for one don't have a problem with it . Unless known members of it ( after it's built ) start running out into the street and blowing shit up , then I will have a problem . \ 
Please note I said NEAR Ground Zero , not ON . There's a difference . 
LIKE\ 
this if I have ever made you smile in your life . Then , set this as your\ 
status , & see how many people you made smile . 
You know you're bored when you decided to fight Slaughterfish with hand to hand on Oblivion . 
My ears are feeling a < PROPMALE > annoying . The cure ? Some mother fuckin ' Moonsorrow , that's what . 
You never fully realize how important someone is to you until they've walked out of your life . 
Bloodshot eyes , metal skin . Serpant's tounge , dagger claws . Dragons wings , crooked horns . < PROPMALE > ! \ 
God , I love Satyricon . 
I'm in the mood for crushing the dreams of children . 
Oh my god , this cock and balls is so good ! There's cream all over my face and everything ! 
Tits . A fish . A fish with tits . Tittyfish . 
I just saw the trailer for the Human Centipede movie . That is the most fucked up thing EVER 
Ever been in the mood to crank up the metal and fuck something up ? I am right now . I've got the metal , but THERES NOTHING TO FUCK UP . ARGH 
Everyone smells like Nosack ! 
Baked , seasoned brocolli ... Hm . Not too bad . 
Well , that's just fucking pissy . 
\Real men hide their feelings . Why ? Because it's none of your fucking business ! \"" 
Argh . I keep forgetting what I'm doing this week and mixing it up with other stuff . Way to go , me . Way to go . 
Clam chowder , ritz , and starbursts for lunch ! Now all that I need is some mountain dew . 
Two prostitutes are working a corner . One says \tonight is going to be a good night ! I can smell the cock in the air ! \ " The other says \ " sorry that's my breath . \"" 
Tonight sucks . 
\This is how we say stick in America : baseball bat ! \"" 
I just noticed my family went to bed . It's 9 o'clock . Huh . 
\That is what forgiveness sounds like . Screaming and then silence . \"" 
I love my new giant lighter . Whenever I light it , there's always a small puff of smoke And the size of the flame is changable . :) 
I'm seeing things move out of the corners of my eyes and hearing sounds . Damn you creepypasta ! 
I have officially not used the microwave in two weeks . I'm so proud of myself . :D 
I have decided that the Dunwich building on Fallout 3 would be the perfect place for some creepypasta . That , or Slenderman's lair . 
I love the Pint-Sized Slasher ! 
After playing through Fallout 3 for the fourth time , I REALLY want to kill Dr. < PROPFEMALE > . She's a bitch . 
Expendables is the greatest movie ever ! Even better than Avatar ( yeah , that's right < PROPFIRST > . I went there ) . 
I have come to realize my lawn mower is a piece of crap and I wish I could smash it with a sledgehammer . Or blow it up ... 
My nose has been brutally raped by a horrible tv dinner stench . Blegh . 
Going camping at mirror laike today . Should be fun ! \ 
P.S. < PROPFIRST > , try not to die while I'm gone . :p 
Ugh . I'm going to have nightmares for weeks now . 
I'm in the middle of no where and I still have phone service ??! What the fuck tmobile ?? 
\I want to lick your ear . \"" 
There is water . Under the tent . And it's leaking in . FML 
I get an entire pizza to myself . Yum . 
I have a craving for Mountain Dew right now . Haven't had it in weeks . Damn me and my addiction . 
There's a bunch of mormons standing outside Best Buy . Hahahahahahahahaha !!! 
Halo Reach legendary edition ... I own it . 
Coffee for an all nighter with Reach ? I think so . 
:( 
A saturday night should not feel like a monday morning . 
Is it mature to call someone immature only to look in that person's general direction and mouth \you guys are stupid ? \"" 
I hate it when I try to do something that I want to do , but I'm not in the mood for it . It's frustrating . \ 
On an unrelated note , bacon for dinner ! 
\My stomach had the rumblies . Rumblies that only hands could satisfy . \"" 
There are two cars sitting outside my house on the street . They're both empty . Hm . Investigation time . 
Fighting Halo Reach Skirmishers is like prison rape . They force you into a corner and attack from all directions . 
Almost got ran over . Good thing I've got quick reflexes . Sometimes . 
I'm not a warrior . I'm a man . 
I love it when classes are canceled . It's more time to do ... Nothing . Awesome . 
The bakers are trash talking eachother across the street . ' Twas entertaining . 
I sometimes wish I could speak Finnish so I knew WHAT THE FUCK MOONSORROW IS SINGING . 
Dear god , European chocolates are amazing . Except ones with coconut . Blech . 
Everytime I play Firefight on Halo Reach , I hear in my head \There was a firefight ! \"" 
My first update from my new laptop . 
Killing people during race on Halo Reach gets satisfying results . 
Installing Firefox and iTunes . After that , moving all my music over from the desktop to my laptop . Fun day ahead . 
\The flower is crawling up my urethra ! And singing ! The flower is singing as it crawls up my urethra ! \"" 
Wireless internet is really shitty for trying to wathc videos . >:( 
There are now supposedly Mexican pirates . I guess they probably travel around on wooden rafts . 
< PROPFIRST > and I : Losing for most of the match . Our two team mates left . We make a comeback . Final score after the timer runs out : 42 to 37 . 
Being sick sucks . :( 
Thinking about the past brings up a lot of mixed feelings . 
Oh rain , how I have missed you . 
My grandma just flipped me off because I asked her how she was doing on her math homework . It's these family moments I < PROPFEMALE > most ... 
Philosophy is an interesting class . Confusing at times , but interesting . 
< PROPMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > , bought a dozen doughnuts , got followed by a < PROPFEMALE > , and walked through the woods guided by the light of the < PROPFEMALE > . ' Twas a good night . 
Doughnuts for breakfast ? I think so . 
Church and then home to do more philosophy homework . Fun day ahead ... 
Baby back rips for dinner . Ahhhh yeeeaaahhhh .

Tacos , Coca-cola , Yu-Gi-Oh !, Halo : Reach , Modern Warfare 2 , metal , and fire with < PROPFIRST > . Oh yeah . 
\I wake up in the morning and take a step outside . I take a deep breath and I get real high ! \"" 
I have found out I like being out in the rain during the day . At night , not so much . 
Chocolate chip waffles . Delicious . 
Philosophy , then NCIS , perhaps some Reach afterward . Sleep to top it all off . 
This bathroom smells a lot like cinnamon . 
I just love having dreams about something you know will never happen ... :( 
I love Happy Tree Friends . 
Damn . Home made brownies are amazing . 
Today is officially my Good Samaritan day . 
I just walked past two young girls dancing against trees like they were poles . The next generation isn't only stupid , but they're also slutty . 
It feels nice getting over 12 hours of sleep . Now time for cinnamon toast crunch and sprite . 
Tonight , the Veil is thinned , and the spirits of the past wander free . And what am I doing ? Philosophy . If I get done with that , party ! 
YES !!! I found my glow in the dark skeleton gloves ! 
What do you call 10,000 furries lying facedown in a ditch ? \ 
a start . 
I hate the feeling when you miss someone , but you know you'll never see them again . 
It's sad all the people that actually believe the myth that hair grows back thicker the more you shave it . 
Just listened to all of Moonsorrow's discography . All six hours of it . I can't wait for their new album . And their next US tour ... 
Just finished a rampage against insects . That grasshopper did put up one hell of a fight . 
Studying time . Blech 
Nap time . 
Everyone has a reason for doing something . Sometimes , it's not the something that is questioned . It's the reasoning behind it we want to understand . 
Nothing reminds me of my dislike of small children more than when there's a bunch running around my house . -_- 
Why does it look like a stack of pancakes with peanut butter on top ? 
I'm the highest rank in the lobby , and what I'm stuck with on my team ? A bunch of Warrant Officers . 
Beatiful , cleansing rain . 
I have come to the conclusion that female metal vocalists are the best vocalists . 
Elite Slayer makes even the gayest maps fun . 
The first three seasons of Destination Truth are on Hulu . This gives me something to do this weekend . :) 
For those who played Oblivion , what did you imagine Mannimarco ( the necromancer leader ) would look like ? 
Oh em gee , the snow is actually sticking ! 
I would read creepypasta before I go to bed . \ 
Dammit . 
Too many Skirmishers . 
Inception = mind rape 
I love free food days . 
I have come to realize that many people don't know the difference between a \troll\ " and \ " spam\ " and that sports fans can sometimes be frothing idiots . "

The earth almost ate me . :( 
Hobo is a large < PROPMALE > Shepherd with a camo collar . He was spotted around SW 6th St. & 20th Ave . in Battle Ground , WA about 9:00 A.M. Saturday , December 11 , 2010 ....

I didn't plan on sleeping tonight anyway ... 
Yup . Definately not sleeping tonight . Damn creepypasta . :( 
\Are you telling me to impregnate Morrigan with some magical sex rite ?! \"" 
Decided to watch all of the Marblehornets videos again . \ 
Sleeping might be a bit of a chore tonight . 
I wish my cough would go away . :( 
After playing through Dragon Age again , I'm wondering how much inspiration Bioware got from Japan ... 
My cough is finally going away . Looks like I didn't need anyone's healing powers after all . 
When a judge sentences a child murderer to life in prison instead of the death sentence on the grounds that living in fear of the general population is a better punishment , you know something is being done right . 
Time to sit back and relax with my Doritos , Mountain Dew , and Fable 3 . 
I love the idea of a personal army of giant robots . 
You know it's going to be one hell of a day when you're fighting off assassins and giant ants . At the same time . 
Just bought Oblivion , Game of the Year Edition on the Pc for $20 . My life is complete . 
I laugh at the people who are afraid of needles . 
I sometimes think God hates me .

The misadventures at Prairie High School never truely end . 
I just opened someone's eyes to the fact that not all metal is \screamo noise\ " as he called it . Mission accomplished . " 
Inception had better win the Best Picture < PROPFIRST > award or I will be a very angry person . 
Am I the only one stuck with a perpetual one notification ? 
The bombing in the Russian airport is being linked to MW2's No Russian mission . What is this world coming to when real events are being compared to a video game ? 
The majority of music on the radio IS bad ! Holy crap ! It's depressing . 
Pizza Pockets are freaking amazing . 
Random conversations will always start when you greet someone by typing their name in all caps . Such is the case with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
Had an interesting time with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > playing Settles of Catan . Board game RPGs can be very entertaining . 
Creepypasta time . Huzzah ! 
Just did Pump up the Jam on Dance Central . Ah yeah . Such fun . 
\omggg guyz ! teh black eyed peas ruined teh haf timez show ! But den slash came on and saved it ! \ " \ 
How come every video player online seems to be a piece of shit ? 
I get it , Microsoft Office . You're downloading the required files and may be unresponsive . But you don't have to remind me every ten seconds with a damn pop up ! 
Just listened to \Like a G6\ " for the first time . It was pretty crappy . " 
Ah , folk metal ... What would I do without you ? 
I always love finding music that's too beautiful for words to describe . 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower ... armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this . 
The show tonight was AWESOME . Except for the screamo . Far too much of that tonight . Kudos to Seeds of Corruption for such a kick ass show , as always . 
Downloading the Dragon Age 2 demo ... It's supposed to take all night , according to the downloads list . Damn this crappy wireless internet . 
I just used \meme\ " in a game of Scrabble . I need to spend less time on the internet ... " 
I'm watching a campaign play-through for the new game Homefront . Not even five minutes into the game , it's already pretty fucked up .
