would love to join a gym IF I didn't have to pay a 300 dollar one time enrollment fee , 700 dollar some other fee , and first and last months $39.97 monthly payments ... 
I want to live in another country 
why am I still awake ... insomnia ... is that you ? 
;) 
wish it would rain every single day 
it's amazing what you learn when you stop thinking and just start watching and listening to what is around you , I sound like I'm stoned but I'm not ha 
let's go bowling ? 
I'm the boring sign of the zodiac , great ... 
FRINGE . That's it . That's all I will watch . I do not like anything else on TV . I hate dancing with the stars . I hate gossip girl and everything else similar , which is everything . I used to like the news but it's obviously biased which is annoying and there's barely anything important on the news anyway , so what is the point . TV is disappointing , I'd rather read . 
fringe season two is released on september 14th , I know what I want for my birthday ... 
You lock the door \ 
And throw away the key \ 
There's someone in my \ 
head but it's not me . \ 
\ 
And if the cloud bursts , thunder in your \ 
ear \ 
You shout and no one seems to hear . \ 
And if the band you're \ 
in starts playing different tunes \ 
I'll see you on the dark side of \ 
the < PROPFEMALE > . 
it's been an interesting weekend ... 
leave\ 
one memory that you and I had together , it doesn't matter if you know \ 
me a little or a lot , anything you remember , just comment here ... 
<3 
Did you know that twinkle twinkle little < PROPFEMALE > and the alphabet song have the same tune ? Why are you singing to yourself ... 
Hello ? 
<3 Sublime ... 
Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black And the dark street winds and bends . Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow , and watch where the chalk-white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends . 
Aint no rest for the wicked ... ;) 
chillin at treasure island free wi fi 
Looking at the MN state fair commemorative < PROPMALE > that people send in for the posters every year , and thinking about how AMAZING it would be if they picked me ... 
Internet radio is addicting ... 
tired from staying up til 5 am this morning , waking up at 7am going to the fair , am home now , waiting for something exciting to happen on facebook , yeah right ... 
I think I need a good friend , a good drink , and a good hug , am I looking for you ? 
thinking to myself that I would rather be weird and misunderstood than be anything else ... :) 
The ATM wished me a Happy Birthday today 
thanks everyone :) xoxo 
Facebook is ... weird now ? 
Facebook wall is looking like it needs some comments ... ;) 
Déjà vu ... 
pink < PROPMALE > <3 
I miss my grandpa ! RIP 
<3 Littlerock 
nothing is on my mind ... better that way anyway 
It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it , but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives . 
alrighty then ... 
Put this on your status and see what people love about you ! I love your ____ . 
my internet connection is pretty much broken temporarily until ...? I'm getting a connection outside , but it's cold ... 
I LOVE DONATING ! 
thinking about my best friend ! Hope you are okay \ 
And I miss you !!!

Never thought my Littlerock pictures would get so many comments . \ 
It's like a monument .

attempting to play farmville ... 
Just bought plane tickets to San < PROPMALE > in January :) 
Fear makes strangers of people who would be friends . - < PROPFIRST > Maclaine 
Excited to go home in one month :) 
champagne/redbull & sometimes liquor ;) 
wants you to send me a number in a message , and I will post a status about you using your number . Only we will know it's what I think of you ! I promise to be nice ! 
#427 ... First thought in my head .... very curious how you came up with these < PROPFIRST > , do you have three favorite < PROPFIRST > or is this random ? \ 
Anyway ! You have made me laugh a lot so thank you for that . Thanks for letting me wear your coat when I was freezing , and thanks for introducing me to IKEA good times for sure ... I think you're cool and a little bit of a dork which is probably why I like you so much :) 
#25 I think you're awesome & a very talented person . Really nice pretty much all of the time . Great style & the videos you post on facebook are cool ! 
#42 . 7 Only you would pick a number like this ... you get a BAD rep most of the time but you know who ? ' s you ... 
#1 you are number one ! haha ;) I think you are probably one of nicest people I've been lucky enough to meet since I've lived here ! You have good taste in music . You seem like you have a better attitude/are more of a social person than I am , which is why everyone loves you . I would love to know what your secret is ... 
I love COFFEE <3 
4:20 in the morning , getting ready for the day , \ 
2 hours of sleep , bring it ...! 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this 
Toss your dashed hopes not into a trash bin but into a drawer where you are likely to rummage some bright morning . - < PROPFIRST > Brault 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas Everyone :) 
I think I taught a little kid how to wave today :) 
Vacation ... :) 
Hanging out with my aunt in San < PROPMALE > :) 
I've been on 4 trains probably 5 cars and what will be 2 planes ... traveling EVERYWHERE what a crazy week 
Back ! :) 
I love the Phoenix 1901 song ! 
sublime second hand smoke 
Facebook has kinda turned into a soap opera ... \ 
Does everything have to be dramatic ? 
I had a flippin good day today ! 
New Fringe Episode ... YES 
Hate when weird strangers knock on your door . Do I know you ? No . Am I going to answer the door ? No . Do I care what you're trying to probably sell to me ? No . 
My favorite typo that I make : Eight instead of Right HAHA 
too busy listening to music & drawing instead of sleeping 
Gossip is a game without a winner . 
So ... I WAS going to go out tonight but this stupid cold and a lack of sleep say no ! \ 
LOL eat watch tv & sleep , works for me .

Found a perfect pair of jeans for two dollars today ;)
