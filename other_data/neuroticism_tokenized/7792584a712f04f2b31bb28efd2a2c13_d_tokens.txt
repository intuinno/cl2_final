Why is it so much fun to put up the decorations , and such a chore to take them down ? I decide to do it in shifts- tree today , the rest later . 

I wish that my Dad would finalize his divorce so that crazy beeotch will be out of my life forever !!!!!!! 
I just unpacked a box that had been unopened since 1999 !! I found 12 bottles of wine ! ( I don't even like wine ! ) GO ME !!!

All that's on my mind is how strange it will be when < PROPFIRST > is gone 
I am thankful that < PROPFEMALE > is cooking me Thanksgiving dinner today so it will be dellicious and not burnt . I am also thankful that my family is going to the movies tommorrow so I still don't have to cook ! 
< PROPFIRST > and I are squabbling over who gets the new laptop . I think it should be me , after all he doesn't have homework . 
I hate this already . 6 months never seemed so long . 
Why can't < PROPFEMALE > make me skinny instead of fat ?? 
Should I decorate , or just pretend Christmas isn't happening ?? 
Why don't I want to leave the house normally , but when I'm snowed in I can't wait to leave ? 
How come I have to count on my fingers to figure out what time it is in Japan ? Just add 16 , but I can't seem to do it without the didgits ! 
Christmas cards are written !! Now for envelopes and stamps !!

How come I am so tired from playing with toys all day ? I guess it was more like arranging toys .... for the giveaway tomorrow . 
Why can't I make this sore throat go away ?? Perhaps I should ply it with Captain < PROPFIRST>'s at least then I would be distracted from the pain !!! 
My massage was cancelled today because the lady had a baby , doesn't she know I need to RELAX ! 
How lucky I am !! 
I am so excited to see what 2010 has in store for me !! 
How do the vehicles know < PROPFIRST > is gone ?? And why does that mean they need to demand $3000 worth of repairs ??? I mean do they miss him that much ???

I just did my taxes !! Japan here I come !!! 
Tomorrow is < PROPFEMALE>'s Birthday and I haven't done ANYTHING to prepare !!?? I'm not sure that a DeMolay Initiation is the right gift for a 15th birthday , but that's what we're doing !!

Why does < PROPFIRST > think he looks like Jonesy on Reno 911 ?? Do they not have mirrors in Japan ??

I am playing a fun game called Quelf with < PROPFEMALE > , April and < PROPFEMALE > !! < PROPFEMALE > has to act like she is riding a horse and smack herself on the ass yelling \Get along little doggie\ " everytime she is in the lead ! " 
My first class this term is 21 credits !! What is that about !?! No pressure

< PROPFEMALE > is SOOO talented- she has mono , bronchitis and a severe sinus infection ! Way to overachieve !!

I AM SMARTER than my electronics !! Movies and popcorn in my room !!!! 
Four days from now I will be on the way to Japan !!!

Made it Okinawa safe and sound !! No problems , good food and LOTS of FREE movies !! Now we're goin ' to the Club !! 
Japanese game shows are very strange ........ 
I can't take a bath in this country without thinking the kid from \The Grudge\ " will be standing there meowing at me !! Scary on so many levels !! " 
Dispite my own Washingtonian pride , I have to say the Okinawa Aquariam kicks the Seattle Aquariam's wet soggy ass . 
I have sand in my toes !!! Our room for tonight is LITERALLY 20 steps from the beach ( 35 to the water ) ........ It's a rough life 
I just think it is odd that I left home on Thursday at 8:00 am , and got here Friday at 9:00 pm , but I leave here at noon Monday and get home at 2:30 on Monday !! Time travel is AWESOME !! 
Ok , so I made it home after only 36 hours in various airports around the world . ( I got an extra hour and 1/2 on the tarmack in a middle seat on the flight to the Springs while they fixed the plane ) GOOD TIMES !!! 
I need a new dishwasher anybody have any advice on a good one ?? 
As if my life isn't strange enough , now someone steals < PROPFEMALE>'s backpack out of the truck in broad daylight !?! Don't they know we're enlisted and have no money ?? 
This weekend was awesome !! congress , running around outside , board games , midnight movie and sunrise service , followed by a loooong nap ! 
Why are people such bad losers ?? If I behaved the way some people are it would give me bad mojo forever !! 
I bought a beautiful new dishwasher today !! Can't wait for the delivery/installation !! 
Only 6 more weeks until < PROPFIRST > is home !!!! Can't wait !! 
OK I ADMIT , I'M A HANDFUL . Unfortunately most women won't repost this . I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best . If you're a HANDFUL then post this on your status . I DARE YOU !! 
My new dishwasher is all installed and is soooo quiet ! Between the new dishwasher and the new stove people will think I know how to cook ....... 
As if I wasn't already THE COOLEST I just rented the first disc of GLEE ( for the second time) ! Sing along at my house !!! 
Why do I have to be so cheap ?? Why couldn't I just pay for the Graduation Announcements like everyone else ?? By the time I get these printed he will be graduating with his PhD !! 
Dear Me , I am sorry I got frustrated with you and ranted on facebook . You are frugal , not cheap ! and have used your ninja superpowers to get the announcements ready to print . It is also not your fault that there is no ink in the printer . <3 love , me 
I am getting excited about Grand Session !! 5 wonderful girls will be with me and we will have the bestest time ever !! 
SO my brand new SAMSUNG stove fell apart and when I called them this rude punk told me they would charge me for the service call !! WTF !!??!! I did talk him out of the charge , but that is just baaaaaaaad customer service !!! 
After sending in my assignment 4 times , the grader finally looks at the part he said was correct and found a HUGE mistake ! GRRRRR , this is not helping my math-phobia . 
I will pay anyone who will answer my stupid math problem ( correctly ) $20.00 just so I can pass this damn class ...... 
I was less than 5 minutes away from a working waterfall today when it started to SNOW !?! WTF ??!!?? 
I hope < PROPFIRST > had fun deep sea fishing today while I was being snowed on doing yard work !?!?! 
How do so many incompetent people get and keep their jobs , when I can't seem to do either one ??? 
Would like to thank her Masonic Family for always keeping things interesting !!

I just got < PROPFIRST>'s flight information ! Colorado Springs Airport at 4:16 , FRIDAY , on United !! Be there or be a Grumpy Gills !!! 
So , funny story . I guess I must realize that I don't have a future in gardening , as < PROPFIRST > spent all day pulling up the dead plants that I planted ( alive ) last week ! Frustrating for both of us ! 
< PROPFIRST > called last night- his plane was leaving in 12 hours and he hadn't even started packing ! Glad to hear he is also amazed at how fast this six months went ! 
I am thankful that Jobies wear robes so that I only have to make one Grand dress , oh and I am excited that < PROPFIRST > will finally be home today ! 
is so happy to have the whole family together again , even if we are too busy to actually be together . 
I can't wait to start the Grand craziness ! How many times can I wear a formal before noon this month ??? My guess is 10 
reason #2 to be happy < PROPFIRST > is home- he did laundry while I slept in !! 
Grand Assembly was AWESOME !! < PROPFEMALE > Wempe and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are amazing and wonderful ! 
is wondering where we go from here . 
is wondering-Why can't I just throw in the towel when that is the thing that makes the most sense ? 
Well , the Grands are finally over . Looking forward to staying at home and emptying my suitcase ! It was fun at Grand Assembly , Grand Session and Conclave , but I'm glad it's only once a year !! I won't be doing that again for at least 12 months !!

Had my first angry customer and crash and burn on product today !! At least that is over and I can make a new mistake ( or several ) tomorrow . 
“Power concedes nothing without a demand . It never did and it never will . Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them , and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows , or both . The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress . ” < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
I just got my first shipment of Gavels and sounding blocks ! Wow I can't wait to sell these they are so pretty ! 
has no words to describe the look on < PROPFIRST>'s face when he came home and discovered me cooking to the sing-a-long Sound of Music . 
Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it . Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many .
