a week of practicals and a week of finals down . uh . i'm not drunk enough to sleep . 

there an officially posted 4.0 semester . something that i haven't managed since before the < PROPFEMALE > of time . 
34 more minutes to 18 hours . Kill me now . Please ? 
word of the day mediocracy : a combination of mediocrity and meritocracy , a philosophy in which the person most qualified to do a job unthinkingly and nothing more is better than one who will excel and potentially rock the boat , completed by an educational system designed to produce mindless automatons who do not wish to think . 
nothing to say , nothing to see , nothing to do ... wtf ? where did that come from ? 
kemosabe , kiss my ass . i bought a boat , i'm going out to sea . 
upside down english ? don't mind if i do . 
just finished a second run through ' the satanic verses . ' totally forgot about that ending . 
apparently facebook now gives me the option to skewer people with my cutlass . when did the internet turn into a trashy romance novel ? 
speak in rhythm and rhyme\ 
patterns to pass time\ 
won't stop time from fading\ 
who cares about the meter\ 
can't buy a liter\ 
still away cascading\ 
\ 
if i had a dollar\ 
under the collar\ 
or lost on a table\ 
instead of the piper , \ 
venomous viper\ 
STILL worth more than this fable 
well the pup is up to 19 pounds and done with her shots . probably another 50 to 70 pounds to go considering the size of her parents , but that'll take until she's three . 
it's not what you do it's how you do it , it's not what you do it's how do it ... HEY MACARENA !!! 
thinks that anyone who regularly uses semicolons or more than three commas in a sentence is a pretentious asshole who is likely suffering from an acute lack of concision . 
\Hasn't it ever occurred to you that in your promiscuous pursuit of women you are merely trying to assuage you subconscious fears of sexual impotence ? \ " \ 
imagine you're a dog . your owner is inside , you're outside . you want to say hi . solution ? jump into window well and through screen . didn't happen , but i could see the most direct route from a to b becoming clear . 
i know the end goal is a piece of paper , but jesus christ ... we're not learning anything , we're not discussing anything , we're not expanding any horizons , and if we are being challenged it is a challenge of how much bullshit we can swallow . can i just write the goddamn papers you want written and skip the rest of you wasting my time ? 
is 2 for 2 . just made 50,000 on my second nano novel . 
thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday yesterday . @ cat we really should get together sometime soon . @ < PROPFIRST > maybe cake some other day , at least for yesterday the cake was a lie . @ < PROPFEMALE > , congrats on finishing your undergrad and thank you for your part in my new shoes . in other news since going back to school i have a 3.83 cumulative gpa once my last unposted grade officially posts . 
enough is enough . going to see the doctor friday . 
travesty of the day : two streets carrying roughly equal traffic , one in front of a ( useless in the snow ) golf course and it's adjoining neighborhood , the other being the < PROPMALE > route for buses and parents taking children to middle school . distance between the two about a mile . golf course road spotless , < PROPMALE > access to middle school nearly untouched . 
completely unscientific and probably wrong superbowl matchup prediction jets/bears based off bears defender eats jets wr both teams challenge ruling on the field of incomplete . bears believe the defender intercepted the pass and jets claim the receiver had possession prior to being swallowed . 
privatize profits , socialize risk 
i've reached a point that i realize that not only do i not know shit from shinola ( what is shinola ? ) or whether the chicken or the egg came first , i'm not even sure how one cooks chicken . the good news is the test grades i got back this week average 99% . 
tonight : calculus , scientific american , logistic regression on impact of $100 into economy according to keynes with outdated assumptions , idea bush tax cuts should be dropped on people earning more than $ 250,000 a year and given to people who can less afford to save it as more effective tax based stimulus , walked dog . it was fun . i am completely not awesome . 
sign at a church : ' where are you spending eternity , smoking or non ? ' sorry guys . not likely to change my mind . besides being a mite abrasive for the representative of the western world's biggest magic hippy either heaven is a jazz bar with bottomless martinis , or hell is the last place it is legal to smoke indoors . i'm betting on the latter . 
thoughts for the day : 1 ) if you can't blind them with your brilliance baffle them with your bullshit . 2 ) it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt . 3 ) if women don't find you handsome they should at least find you handy . 
if all parties involved feel like they've been screwed they've probably come to the right conclusion . 
< PROPFIRST > sheen = < PROPMALE > norris^-1 
and now for our main event : a no holds barred fight to the death ! who will emerge victorious ? in this corner wearing the sable fur , < PROPFEMALE > the < PROPMALE > shepherd ! in the opposite corner we have vacuum in the clear canister and purple trim ! only one will survive ! and now we go to the booth for the experts take ... 
today was a good day
