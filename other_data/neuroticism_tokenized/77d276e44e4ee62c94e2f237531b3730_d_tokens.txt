I'm loving the Laker fever around me ! 
Last nights game was too good ! 
What to wear ? 
who is at the parade ? 
your heart is my pinata .... 
one of the hardest things in life is to watch the one you love , loving someone else ... 
Trying to make someone fall in love with you is about as pointless as trying to control who you fall in love with . ” 
Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning . ” 
“You can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see , but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel . ” 
“Love is not blind ; it simply enables one to see things others fail to see . ” 
“To the world you may be just one person , but to one person you may be the world . ” 
“Love is saying ' I feel differently ' instead of ' You're wrong . ' ” 
“I love you not because of who you are , but because of who I am when I am with you . ” 
“I would rather have eyes that cannot see ; ears that cannot hear ; lips that cannot speak , than a heart that cannot love” 
Spiteful words can hurt your feelings but silence breaks your heart . ” 
We cannot do great things on this Earth , only small things with great love . ” 
“It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return , but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel . ” 
I am just trying to spread some love through quotes ... 
yo ' momma ! 
wowee ... I might be bored after the 30th .... 
blah , bleh , blah 
Ugh ! 
Guys are cochinos ! 
My shiny black heels are fired ! 
< PROPFIRST > saved my weekend nights . Thanks ! 
Matchmaker ... something has to keep me sane 
Ah ! Morning ! 
night casts a spell that unfortunately fades with the suns glare 
Wow !!! 
As my niece would say , my homie-dog is coming into town :) 
Both my cars are out !!!! This sucks ! I missed so much this weekend :( 
It took me a long time to be the person I am . To be honest , open , loving , and caring to be vulnerable in order to see the beauty in others , to be sensitive to reciprocate love . It took time to develop an understanding that these feelings are mine alone , not meant for anyone to control or reign over . 
I firmly believe it’s the moments of solitude that bring on the fears we must overcome to grow and become our true selves . It took me many years to accept that the greater weakness was denying myself in order to conform to a social standard of being or eluding others in the belief that I am always in control . I am no longer conditioned to fear fear 
I had fruity pebbles and woke up in the chicken coop :) 
Yo , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , Sim , and < PROPFIRST > ... que paso ? 
I'm sick . I am feverish , vomiting and taken advils and still have aches all over my body . Ouchy 
by the way , I'm a vegetarian ! 
to find focus is harder than I thought it would be 
traveling the path of change is challenging 
Taking a break ... molto tired 
PS .... Being a vegetarian is hard when everyone is eating burgers , carne asada , and ceviche ... Seesh , I'm hungry 
Yo ! Papas are wickety- whack ! 
I'm a fatty lil ' vegetarian :o 
Lost my keys at Magic Mountain . It was crazy ! Rode Goliath 4 times in a row ! Thanks Nashea ... and for eveyrone else . Be careful with your car keys 
This last weekend was ... HIJOLE !!!! \ 
To my chicas , ya'll know who you are , let's stay strong . We are definetely more like family and I feel like everything happens for a reason . We bonded and I'm so glad we did . We got alot of conquering to do . Vamonos ! 
Sick with a not-cute hair cut :( 
My mullet is now just a short do 
I wish my friends the best , cuz they deserve it , and I really hope two things happen soon ... 1 ) Women realize their worth and demand respect , equality , and REAL love and 2 ) Phasing out of boy-men . Grow up and let the testes descend ! Not to all , but we all know at least one and the message should be clear . Time to ressurect chivalry and respect ! 
I miss my hair !!! AND !!! being a vegetarian is making me fat . My favorite meatless foods , are cake and macaroni and cheese . YUM ! 
Bronchitis ! Salmonella ! Oh no !!! That's what I got . Hijole . Too drowsy from the medication 
tonight ? what to do ? 
excuse my spelling , especially now . I'm sick :( 
21 units , homework , and my usual life leave no free time . I miss some people , and in the midst of all this , I'm still vegetarian , aka hungry , and my hair is not growing at the rate I was hoping . On the upside , I'm well and enjoying the journey :) \ 
Peace to all !!! 
This last weekend was CRAZY !!! 
Thanks to my friends for allowing me to work them in shifts . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , I'll see you Friday ! I'm too excited . It's been great catching up with everyone ! Bri . You're too pretty ( it's almost unfair ) jk . I love you all ... and Nashea , HIJOLE !!!!

I'm wondering where all the nice guys went ... 
I know we are all guilty of using Facebook as our communication outlet . I'd like to remind you that my cell is working . ( 818 ) 689-1785 . Feel free to drop a text , or even call . I'd love to see you face to face . I'm trying to end this non-communication , communication . End the madness ! I exist ! 
I exist outside of facebook 
I JUST got into a terrible accident where I was rear ended . All my plans are out the door , and I am in so much pain . It wouldn't be a new month without some visit to the ER . On my way :( 
I just wanted to thank everyone for the well wishes . I am in so much pain , but it's to be expected . I am grateful for life , because it could of been a lot worse . I hope all is well for all you out there . Peace 
be kind to one another 
My phone died ! I'm okay , but all my friends who rely on texting me may suffer until I get out of class ! Sorry :( 
Who is watching Jack-Ass tonight and going to Disneyland tomorrow ? ME !!! 
I'm so blessed to have friends who spoil me with their gift of colors , assembly of words and song , so I hope EVERYONE can attend Mental Mondays at House of BREWS ( not Blues ) in San < PROPMALE > on Maclay .

Death is simply a souls awakening from what we perceive to be reality 
#1 . Be impeccable with your word ... \ 
#2 . Don't take anything personally ... \ 
#3 . Don't make assumptions ... \ 
#4 . Always do YOUR best ... 
I have yet to exhaust all possibility , yet they come close to exhausting me . 
Phone in the car , wine in my hand and rain is the perfect company 
Like the tree that falls in the < PROPMALE > ... If you don't recognize your relationship on Facebook , does it really exist ? 
Finally watching \Waiting for Superman\ " \ 
homework , go away ! 
What is the poke etiquette ? Does it simpy require a poke back , or does it warrant a different response ? Still learning ...
