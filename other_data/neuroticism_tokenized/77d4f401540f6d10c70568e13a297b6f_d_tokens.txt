\This day's black fate on more days doth depend :/ This but begins the woe others must end . \ " Act III Scene I " 

For YayYay ... \ 
\But when you're standing at a crossroad 
I was just outside and a black f150 drove by slowly and caught me dancing to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s \Respect\ " with my cat < PROPFIRST > . Thank GOD these rednecks rarely have youtube capability with them . What are the frikken chances of that happening ? lol " 
Happy 71st anniversary to the Wizard of Oz ! 
I have NO idea why every so often I have this incessant need to listen to Akon . I think it's < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s fault . After that night of 8 hours worth . I don't even LIKE Akon ! 
\Call me a relic 
Changed my mind about the country . \Another fallacy/ Is laid in front of me/ Now I just don't know/ What to believe/ Another animal/ Sent to devour what-/evers left inside . \ " -Disturbed ( Deceiver ) "

\ ... I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Finally back at school . Music class ... hrm . 
Gotta go find my class ! Eeeep . 
It's horrible when your internet connection won't even let you get on aim . AIM used to be ALMOST possible to access without a modem . Why can't rural catch up ? I want cable ! 
Gram's been gone for two weeks and she's back tomorrow . Dear God , we have to CLEAN ! * Runs off screaming * lol 
Aspercreme with heat is frikken AWESOME . Yes ! I am old ! hehehe 
Back to endless cleaning , yay oh yay . 
\Beethoven is Mozart on steroids . \ " -my music teacher at college . " 
Gram's will be here in a couple of hours . Then the fun begins , wheee ! 
There is nothing in this world like vacuuming to the rhythm of a monk chanting , I assure you . 
Gram's home ! 
Watching Naruto with < PROPFEMALE > and Mikey and Gram . 
watched Naruto alll night with Mikey , now for the crash . * yawns * 
Abbigale is growing up far too fast . Not too old to go snail hunting with < PROPFIRST > , though . ;) 
Here's a question I have been giving a lot of thought lately : If I died tonight , how would you remember me ? Comment only if you're comfortable doing so . 
Getting ready for school , so I'm away from the keyboard . 
Off to school . message me on here and it sends it to my phone . BBL . :) 
Oki . Going to class , yay . If I don't respond to your messages right away , that's why . ;p 
Rarely in this life can you enjoy the perks of something without also having to endure the drawbacks . 
Is anyone else's instant messaging messing up ? Mine says to go online to chat with friends ... but then it says \chat disabled for internal login . \ " Hrmmm . " 
English , Music , English , Music , life , English , Music ... lol 
School later today , bed now . 
Music class today , argh . 
Facebook hates me sometimes . Class time ! 
Facebook lies ! I am not offline ! 
Bed time . All of life is but a dream within a dream , after all . ;) Message me if you need me . 
Confucius say \study the past if you would divine the future\ " so I thought I'd better get to it . " 
“Happiness is like those palaces in < PROPFEMALE > tales whose gates are guarded by dragons : we must fight in order to conquer it . ” - Alexandre Dumas Père 
Getting ready to go to the movies with Cat and < PROPFIRST > . 
The Expendables was frikken Awesome ! I loved it ! So action packed I will have to buy it to catch all of it . 
Now watching Dear < PROPFIRST > with Gram . I hope it isn't as terrible as it seems . I cannot stand drama . 
As of that last letter , I despise this movie with a hellish passion . 
Oh my God ! Could this movie get any WORSE ? 
\Canker'd with peace 
About time to find out what horrors my English professor has in store for us today ... yayyyy ! 
Word of the day : Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and yes , it is a real word . 
Watching Naruto , wheee . 
Bed , bed , bed ... 
is not thrilled to be drug out of bed with less than four hours sleep on a school day . 
School's out forever ... Okay , not really ... In fact , I'm going to my music class now . Did you know Tchaikovsky thought the Nutcracker was his worst work ? Ironic . 
“Then must you strive to be worthy of her love . Be brave and pure , fearless to the strong and humble to the weak ; and so , whether this love prosper or no , you will have fitted yourself to be honored by a maiden's love , which is , in sooth , the highest guerdon[in this case reward ] which a true knight can hope for . ” -Sir < PROPFIRST > Conan < PROPMALE > 
Short , short , short , loooong ... Beethoven's fifth is so awesome . ;) 
Learning to read sheet music at my age is a < PROPMALE > pain . Teach your kids young ! Any language works infinitely better when one is very young . Broaden their horizons early ! 
“When you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth . ” -Sir < PROPFIRST > Conan < PROPMALE > 
SO wishing that I had < PROPFEMALE>'s energy . 
In this life there is absolutely nothing without consequence . Not a single moment goes by without cost and not a single action ( or for that matter inaction ) escapes an expenditure of some form . The secret is to find what you are willing to pay the most for , and pay it gladly . Choose wisely , lest you pay a high price for something worth nothing . 
School is here again , weee . Going to get ready . 
Study ... Study ... Study ... 
Today is the big day ! We are all going to see Resident Evil for Cat's birthday , Yay ! We have been anticipating this since the last one , and now the waiting is over ! 
Deadline for English essay : tomorrow . Ugh ! 
Bed , I have rarely considered what a sweet word that is . I will probably wake up to find my essay is nothing but garble because I am so tired . I understand that I am this tired because I don't care ( at the moment ) if I wake up to find that . lol 
Woo , my essay isn't garbled mess . Now I am late getting ready for school . I am always behind one way or another ! 
Preparing to go to Music class , once again . Roll over Beethoven . 
I spilled an entire Dr. Pepper in my keyboard , now I have to beat the keys to death . * cries * Of course , it then went onto my Music Class questionairre . I am such a klutz . 
Alright Noles , lets end BYU today . Or , well ... at least play a good game . :D 
thinks there is nothing like the feeling before a game . The nervousness , excitement , the whole thing . It's almost as if I'm going to be playing myself . lol Oh NO ! Left tackle's not playing . Poor Ponder , I hope he does better under even more pressure . 
83 yard touchdown !!!! THAT'S the way to do it , Noles ! 
We have got to stop losing momentum after the start . Come on boys , don't give the game away . 
In other news : RIP < PROPFEMALE > Bulldogs . That's 0-2 this season , what happened ? 
TOUCHDOWN !! Yes ! ( < PROPFEMALE > told me I shouldn't holler so much lol ) 
TOUCHDOWN !!! We are on fire !!! 27-10 ! DO IT NOLES ! ( Now < PROPFEMALE > is yelling with me . ) 
TOUCHDOWN !!! This game is over , we annihilated them in the second half . AWESOME ! 
Goodnight ! \Take this kiss upon the brow ! \ 
Off to English class ! hehehe \There he goes -- the man what learned me English . \ " -- < PROPFIRST > B . Keane " 
Sleeep ... must stop playing kingdoms of camelot and go to sleep ... * drags herself away * nightnight ! 
The score is 1 0-0 , Noles winning , yes ! But , lightning has delayed the game . :( Hopefully we don't lose our oomph in 40 minutes . 
SHUT OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah Baby ! We got our first shut out in 4 years ! 31-0 , that's the way to do it Noles ! 
Oy , English class with no sleep at all . I wonder if I can write a critical analysis in my zombie state . I guess we will see . ;) 
Sometimes at night I look back and just go ' holy crap , what a day this has been . ' Heh . 
just got off the phone with the Republican National Committee's teleconference call . Interesting new strategy . FortyPhoneCalls.com 
FSU Vs . UVA : 34-14 final . Alright Noles ! We are 4-1 , next stop Hurricanes ! 
We will be having a memorial tomorrow for the Gators , who drowned tonight because of the unstoppable force of the Tide . Hehehehehehe . 
Yawn . Bed , then English class . 
Gotta get ready for school now . < PROPFIRST > is going to get eaten for never being able to keep her mouth shut . Weeee . 
Heading home from < PROPMALE>'s , be there in a bit . 
Music class today , weee . My hands and ankles are so sore from working out , yay ! 
* grumbles * nothing like a professor that cancels class by putting a notice on the door . I could have saved a 3 hour round trip and $20 . 
thinks there is nothing so vexing as going to get your hair done and getting exactly what you didn't want . 
Chillin ' with < PROPFIRST > , who I just sent to catch a wily cat named Sarge , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Knowledge is a mighty responsibility and life , like chess , is a game of strategy . If you cannot see the entire game played out in your mind , play very cautiously . If you CAN see the entire game played out in your mind , play even more cautiously , because you are a delusional fool . 
31-7 so far , DO IT ' NOLES !!! 
Oki ... 31-14 ... as long as we HOLD THEM now , we'll be alright . 
Shoes coming off everywhere in this game lol 
We have GOT to protect Ponder better !!! They are eating him alive , come ON boys ! 
Good God , these ' Canes are VICIOUS . 
Plough through that defense for a first down and lose another shoe .... this game is a heartstopper ! 
TOUCHDOWNNNNNNNNN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so proud I'm gonna cry ! 
YES ! Interception !!! My night could not be better right now ! :) 
There's the tears , Touchdown across the entire field !!!! Seminoles have DESTROYED the Hurricanes . Tomorrow the groom will be sad , but the Bride will be delighted ! 
FSU defeated the ' Canes making FSU 6-1 , the Gators were defeated by LSU making them 5-2 , we are ahead , yeah !!! Not to mention my home team , the GameCocks , defeated the undefeatable Crimson Tide . An AWESOME DAY ! 
Heck of a wedding that was ! Pink hair , guitars , rock music , and vows that promised to share the xbox . It was awesome ! Congratulations < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ! 
UGHHHH gotta go to school , English class . 
Doing Halloween decorations if my help ever returns * taps her foot impatiently * SO hard to keep good help . 
Music class , assuming the professor is there this time . 
Bed , then doctor , then < PROPFEMALE > . Yayyy :) 
Cannot stand it when my darn domain goes down on Kingdoms of Camelot ! 
Phew , what a close one . Ponder is going to have to put on his big girl panties and figure out what is wrong with him if we expect to continue winning . But , YAY for defense and special teams , congrats !! GO ' NOLES ! 
To the Gators : Don't worry , it'll get better . The worst thing you can do is lose heart . Look at us ' Noles , we know how to lose and shrug it off to go on to a win later . Better < PROPMALE > up , we are not interested in a defeated and deflated rival , get your spirit back ! 
thinks her brain is going to burst from the synthesis essay draft , and then another draft ... and then another ... Beddddddddd , must reboot brain . 
UGH finally , BED ! I am going to get like 10 minutes sleep before class and I already felt crappy ... yayyy ! 
much to my delight , we watched Devdas in English today . The substitute professor flipped when I told her the first time I watched that movie was in < PROPFEMALE > . ;) 
Just watched the latter half of Groundhog Day ... love that movie ( and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > in general ) and now Dragnet the movie is on ! I love it too , and the show . ;) 
While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man who would love to remind her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make your woman cry , there's a man who would be happy just to see her smile . Post this on your wall if you're against domestic violence . 
it's LOVE MY SISTER week . If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you stumble , cheered you on and kept you strong , post this . Sisters are a friend forever . Put this on your status if you have an amazing sister ( or sisters ) ? 
Ghost Walk when I get up , weee ! So excited to take < PROPFEMALE > to see the ghosties ! 
The wolves were AWESOME ... One took a bit too much of an interest in me and that was slightly embarassing ... but , it was great ! < PROPFEMALE > had a blast , as did we all . We will HAVE to go back for Christmas ! 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have been eaten by dragons . The other 7% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and their face book enabled phones . ;) 
Music class , weee . :) 
Both \Salt\ " and \ " Despicable Me\ " were great ! " 
Hopefully my Noles don't lose heart after this lose . 
Bleh , why on earth is KoC continuously refreshing like a maniac ? This is the oddest way I have ever seen the domain go down . 
Happy Halloween !! \ 
\ ALL : Double 
Monday and English , oh joy ! ... heh . 
Goodnight everyone , don't forget to vote !! :) 
If only open office would finish downloading ... I could go to bed ! 
Going to bed and praying it finishes ... Goodnight . :) 
Off to my dream world and what < PROPFEMALE > r adventure it may take me to this < PROPFEMALE > . ;) 
Movie review for English ... ugh wha a way to spend a weekend . Oh well ... :) 
28-21 ... We better extend our lead ... c'mon Noles . ;) 
* sniffles * We are falling apart . Come ON , Noles !! 
What is it going to take for Stoops to beat that this is a dang PASSING game into the defense ?? 
That's it ... shoot me , put me out of my misery before I have to endure any more of this game . I cannot believe we just missed that field goal . 
BRILLIANT !! ROFL absolutely brilliant . Perhaps we should recruit the Tar Heels ' punter , because he just gave us a heck of a gift and it's obvious he was playing for us , hehehe !!! 
Condemned to share the fate of the Gators and their kicker . Lost by a field goal :( I am going to go cry and drown my sorrows in coffee and gummy LifeSavers . 
Oy , thank God the rough draft is done ... which only leaves the final draft before next week ... ughhh . 
is helping The Humane Society of the United States win $ 250,000 from the Pepsi Refresh Project to rescue animals from abuse and neglect . Please join me at : http://bit.ly/hsuspepsi

I will be praying for the surgery to go well for < PROPFEMALE>'s Grandma ... and , finally , please go to my wall and vote for the Humane Society's project in Pepsi's Refresh ! Have a great day ! :) 
A\ 
Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check\ 
payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and \ 
including , their life . That is beyond honor and there are way too many \ 
people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste \ 
... this as your status if you are a Veteran , love a Veteran , or support the\ 
troops ! 
Praying for < PROPFIRST > , my nephew , please join me ! 
* Praying for < PROPFIRST > , may God heal my sweet baby nephew !!! * Can someone please tell me why EJ is starting QB tonight ??? Dear God we have started this game with penalty after penalty and already gave up a TD . Gram wants to beat the ref . 
* Praying for < PROPFIRST > , may God heal my sweet baby nephew !!! * What a bad day ... My baby nephew is stuck in the hospital and I have shouted myself hoarse over the screw-ups of my own team . I'd ask what next , but I'm too smart for that . 
* Praying for < PROPFIRST > , may God heal my sweet baby nephew !!! * YES !!!! There is hope !!!! In the last three seconds , Hopkins wins the game with an amazing 55 yard field goal !!!! My Seminoles pulled it out ! 
Unfortunately , without the game to focus on , all of my worries come back . Please Lord , let my nephew be all right . 
Going for a nap , after praying for < PROPFIRST > some more , and then some more , and then ... Yeah , you get the picture . PLEASE call if there are any updates at all ! 
< PROPFIRST > and school today . 
I love my bed , we have been parted for too long , good ... er ... morning everyone , I'm going to sleep ! 
Cousins\ 
are the first friends of your life .... when you grow up , they are still\ 
your friends . Repost this if you have some of the best cousins in the \ 
world 
This day is dedicated to the greatest storyteller of my life , uncle Big'un . He could always be relied upon to spin a fantastic tale for all of us kids and he let us choose the details . No matter how many details we threw in to try to stump him , he always came up with a unique happy ending . Without him , my imagination & love of books would'nt be so great and my world would be a much darker place ! We love you , Big'un! 
After one more assignment , I get a break from school , yay ! Of course , when I go back it's finals ... but , I will worry about that later . Alas , off to bed . :) 
Today is a special day ! My baby sister turns 18 today , God help us all . Happy Birthday my baby girl , I love you eternally ! 
iCarly ... iStart a fan war is frippen hilarious ! Webicon is funny . 
I cannot believe I missed the FSU game . I completely forgot about it , I was so absorbed in playing with < PROPFEMALE > . FSU beat < PROPFEMALE > 30-16 and next week is the Big one ! I have missed two games this season , one for a wedding and the other for < PROPFEMALE > , so I had very good reasons . < PROPFEMALE > read me a book ! I thought I would cry with pride !!! 
Happy Birthday uncle Big'un ... you are still with us and always will be . We love you ! 
Happy Thanksgiving ! I am eternally thankful for my friends and family ! 
Thank you to everyone that wished me a happy birtjhday ! You guys make me feel loved and all warm and fuzzy inside . :) My birthday curse petered out this year and I had a really good day ! Thank God for that . 
Today is the big day , GO ' NOLES !!!! :D 
YES !!! 24-7 in the half !!!! DO IT ' NOLES ! Oh , and GO < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
Today was a great day for football . My Seminoles are the Atlantic division ACC Champs , we beat the gators and now we have a shot at the orange bowl ! Woo ! South < PROPFEMALE > won , too ! Yay ! On a different note , get into the season of giving and give whatever you can to HSUS or the Salvation Army , please . :) 
I have made a choice . If you were going to give me a Christmas present this year , then please : Donate to the Humane Society or help an animal . Give a gift to a toy drive , anything to help the innocent and helpless . If you weren't giving me a gift , may I ask you to ? Just one ARK ( Act of Random Kindness ) will make my Christmas . Humanity suffers as we stop caring , please revive it with love . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , God bless ! 
School and lots of prayer for < PROPFIRST>'s mom and my teacher's son tonight . 
Please excuse my prolonged absence everyone . I love and miss you guys and have not forgotten you ... I am afraid finals are to blame . I will return ! Until then , don't forget the ARK ( act of random kindness ) and general goodwill that should accompany this -- well , in truth , every -- season ! 
The final is here , God help me . I woke up running through conducting patterns yesterday . Now I am going to get about ten minutes sleep before I go to class , yay ! Pray for me lol 
Heh . So we were going to pick up < PROPFEMALE > on Friday and the tire fell off . I sure hope we can fix Baby ( my car ) soon ! I hope all of you are fighting your Scrooge-like impulses ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
My car still isn't fixed . I sure hope that something good happens before long , else I'll have to drop my classes at school and sit at home . Ah well , I had a good Christmas and I am very grateful ! Here's to wishing for a great new year ! 
Happy New Year ! My team won and I screamed my head off at Buffalo Wild Wings ( though it was a victory over my first ever home team ... I would have preferred beating someone else ... ) , I seen fireworks , and nothing terribly bad happened . Therefore , it was a good New Years ! Car isn't fixed yet , but hopefully soon ... 
There is nothing like riding to school in a < PROPFIRST > ! 
School went well , too bad getting there next time is always up in the air . Ah well , at least the first day is down ! :) 
Yay !!! I got to watch Yu-Yu Hakusho with Mikey . I was feeling a bit down , but I feel great now ! 
I completely disagree with facebook's mandate on upgrading to that new profile . 
Well , first classes down . I like all of my teachers and professors , yay ! Now , we see if the heavier load of classes , combined with my lack of a car and need to play musical rides , kills me . Also , if that doesn't get me , the extra homework hours every night might . Weeee ! Bring on the knowledge * grins * 
I have so many projects due so soon at school that I cannot remember half of them . Well ... I have always loved a challenge . 
Facebook is so slow , I can't even get on my apps , which includes KoC . :\\ Also , I have two new projects to add to the list . That makes 7 research projects due twitchily soon .... yay . 
So much research ... now , to bed ! When I wake up , school and more research ! Yay ! 
Research must end for the night ... er ... day ... er ... until I wake up ( and play with < PROPFEMALE > first ) . Goodnight and have a great day ! 
Research , research , essay , research , presentation , research , essay .... yeah . :) 
Changing the world begins at home ; changing one's home begins with changing one's self ; changing one's self begins with changing one's thinking ; therefore , if you want to change the world , change your mind . 
Sleepless study rant for the night : the word sesquipedalian is rather sesquipedalian , isn't it ? :D 
Word of the night : somniloquence . The act of talking in one's sleep . Not to be confused , of course , with somnambulance ( sleep-walking ) :) 
Study , study , study ... stand , stretch ... study , study , study ... lol 
Close reading of my Criminal Justice text and then bed always makes for very interesting dreams . Goodnight/morning guys . <3 
Hey ! Village Idiots picketing fallen soldiers ' funerals .... Yeah , I'm talking to you ! Do you know WHY you are allowed to do that ? BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE DISRESPECTING GAVE HIS OR HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY ! Feel free to copy and post-I did because I wasn't afraid to express my undying gratitude to every single service person past , present and future . 
God be with the earthquake and the tsunami victims . I am keeping them in my prayers . 
I was very disappointed not to get < PROPFEMALE > yesterday , but I can't wait to get her Monday ! We are going to have so much fun ! \ 
Oki , everyone ... I'm off to bed , so here is the quote of the morning :\ 
“Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves . ” - < PROPFIRST > Gustav < PROPFEMALE > ( My favorite psychologist ! ) 
Quote of the morning : \ 
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood , \ 
And sorry I could not travel both \ 
And be one traveler , long I stood \ 
And looked down one as far as I could . . . \ 
Oh , I kept the first for another day ! . . . \ 
I shall be telling this with a sigh \ 
Somewhere ages and ages hence : \ 
Two roads diverged in a wood , and I— \ 
I took the one less traveled by , \ 
And that has made all the difference . 
Finally getting over the stomach flu from hades . Thank God ! Hopefully it's back to school tomorrow ! 
Goodnight facebook . Quote of the morning : \ 
IF I can stop one heart from breaking , \ 
I shall not live in vain ;\ 
If I can ease one life the aching , \ 
Or cool one pain , \ 
Or help one fainting robin\ 
Unto his nest again , \ 
I shall not live in vain . \ 
~ Emily Dickenson 
Sometimes when you find the right thing , you realize it's been there all along . Yayyy . :) <3 
Time to go to bed and what a day I have had ! I can't believe it finally happened ... :) 
I would like to issue a formal apology to my rampant addiction to April Fool's Day antics . I am not engaged to my best friend Mikey . My cat lady title has not been threatened . :D It was a fun prank and I enjoyed it , but I sincerely hope it did not cause anyone undue stress . Love you guys ! 
Goodnight facebook ! Quote of the morning :\ 
PAIN has an element of blank ;\ 
It cannot recollect\ 
When it began , or if there were\ 
A day when it was not . \ 
It has no future but itself , \ 
Its infinite realms contain\ 
Its past , enlightened to perceive\ 
New periods of pain . \ 
~ Dickinson 
Goodnight facebook ! Quote of the morning : ... That spirit moves\ 
In the green valley , where the silver brook , \ 
From its full laver , pours the white cascade ;\ 
And , babbling low amid the tangled woods , \ 
Slips down through moss-grown stones with endless laughter ... \ 
~ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow \The Spirit of Poetry \""
