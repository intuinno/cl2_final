On October 31st 1981 < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Potter lost their lives . Their son < PROPMALE > remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse . Their house , invisible to Muggles , has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family . Repost this if you are fighting against Lord Voldemort and never forgetting what the Potters did for their son .

Playing some good ol ' fashioned Oblivion . 
“Everything you do is a combination of success and failure . There is no absolute success and failure . There is no moment in which you complete the mission and say , ' Ah ! I am done ! Thank you , ' because the mission is never complete because the mission is your life and it only completes when you die . ” - < PROPMALE > Green 
Warming up with some Clementi sonatinas . ^_^ 
< PROPMALE > , just when I think you can't be any dumber , you do something like this ... and TOTALLY redeem yourself !
