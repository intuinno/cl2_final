Some dude < PROPMALE > & I were playing COD with messaged both of us to bitch about how we need to stop camping and told us we sucked .

I don't care anymore 
I am like a sponge when it comes to sleep lately , holy crap . 
We had a lot going for us . We had found the glue that held all things together- in a perfect place where the noise did not intrude . Our world was so very complete .

I love how certain people only contact me when they need or want something . Do me a favor and don't bother anymore - you won't get a response from me . 
Uh ... I think my sleeping schedule is slightly backwards . 
I wish there was a way that I could go back to the old me without relapsing so badly .
