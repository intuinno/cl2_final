Thanks everyone ! I had a pretty excellent 16th birthday ! 
Really hit the bullseye with that poetry notebook . 
Jazz Fest was pretty sick . That is , if you don't count the seven hours spent on a bus . 
really , really despises Mr. Search and his stupid essays on stories that make no sense . 
is dreaming of a white christmas . But that probably won't happen because he's in Hawaii . 
Ukelule for Christmas ? Heck yes . 
is home . Whew . 
had a very productive jam session after the terror of pep band ended . 
needs more hippie music on his ipod . 
is the pinnacle of manliness , according to Mr. < PROPMALE > . 
just wrote a literary analysis twice as long as his short story . Curse you , Mr. Search .
