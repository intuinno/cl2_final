God is speaking volumes to me thru my kids . Someone just posted something \I always say it takes a defining situation to see who a person really is . \ " I am trying to come to grips with the fact that I screwed up my marriage and it is my responsibility to finally fight for it . I have a bullheaded husband and it will definitely not be easy but I need to finally not have regrets . Pray for me to get moxie and keep it . "

Gossip is hurtful . Venomous gossip can kill a relationship . I have done enough damage on my own . Don't make it worse . My life ( with or without fabrication ) does not need to be the topic of anyone's conversation . Thank you . 
IRREGARDLESS ( PLEASE IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN use regardless instead . ) The most frequently repeated remark about it is that “there is no such word . ” There is such a word , however . It is still used primarily in speech , although it can be found from time to time in edited prose . Its reputation has not risen over the years , ... and it is still a long way from general acceptance . DO NOT LET IT CATCH ON !!!

Only a mind that listens can understand anything . Listening is not passive as most of us think . Listening is allowing a message to sink in , without judgments & without criticism . Don't comment .

Never be afraid to try something new , remember amateurs built the Ark , professional built the Titanic . 
Since Jesus went through everything you're going thru and more , learn to think like him . Think of your sufferings as a weaning from that old sinful habit of always expecting to get your way .

All blame is a waste of time . The only thing blame does is to keep the focus off ourselves ... especially when we are looking for external reasons to explain our unhappiness or frustration . We may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming them , but we won't succeed in changing whatever it is about ourselves that is making us unhappy . - < PROPMALE > Dyer
