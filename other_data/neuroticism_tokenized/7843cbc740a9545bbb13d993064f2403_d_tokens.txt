:::: applause ;;;; 53 daylilies planted and watered in .... leaving 33 annuals and perennials for tomorrow ... yes I AM ignoring all the gardens woefully in need of splitting and the entire greenhouse ! LOL at least for now . pictures to follow . 
AAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAH I have been flocked . I looked out on my lawn and found a flock of 25 flamingos trying to get in the greenhouse . A mass flocking . A cluster flock . Shame on ye , < PROPFEMALE > ! AAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA Shame ! SHAME ! AHAHAHAHAHAH < THUD > AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHAHA 
The flamingo flock has flown away . Those mischievous birds have merrily migrated . I shall have a victorious vendetta vs < PROPFEMALE > . Will it be vis a vis vindication ? A stealth surprise ? So she shall see . < insert evil laugh >

Driving in the car one day , when my little son was two , \ 
He had a faraway look in his eye , as toddlers often do . \ 
He leaned over to his < PROPFEMALE > and very quietly said , \ 
\I know where my Bompa is 
I don't know how he knew at two what a barrel roll could be\ 
I asked how he knew that , he said \the angel just told me . \ " \ 
THEN I drove to the airport . < BG > AAAHAHHAHA Ok ... NEXT time we make sure Dunkin Donuts is open BEFORE the flight ... NOT after ! THEN my sister Deir and I grabbed young < PROPMALE > again and went to the beach for the day . GREAT weekend ! < BG > Dishes washed , laundry finished , tables squared away ... I plan on sleeping tonight . But I reallllllllllllllly think we need a Labor Day BBQ . Yes , I do . :D 
I am glad everyone could make it !! We had a GREAT time ! So many faces I have not seen for so long < BG > Congrats again to < PROPFIRST > and our wonderrful new daughter in law , < PROPFEMALE > . We are thrilled to have her in the family . \ 
Afterwards , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and I went looking at < PROPFEMALE>'s {{{ puppies }}} . By time we got back from < PROPMALE>'s , < PROPFEMALE > and I decided because her plane left early , to stay awake . AHAHAHA 
Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
We have fenced off the property we use from the rest of the woods . Yet , < PROPFEMALE > and friends keep coming into the gardens near the road . My husband thinks a bus is dropping them off .....
