Happy New Year's everyone ! 

Look at what I learned ! =) \ 
(*<_*) \ 
Look at it carefully and guess what it is . =P 
FACEBOOK WARMING ON MEH < PROPFEMALE > ! I am SOOOO excited ! I never was able to understand this complicated , amazing , fascinating , mysterious , totally new and somewhat overrated feature of the modern day social networking business ! Now I hope I just can learn to be cool about it . ^^ ;\ 
\ 
Yeah . Cool . 
Oh and if anyone just happens to have any pics with my beautiful face on them ... please share . I really need a new profile photo ... this one makes my head look unattractively big . 
Anyone know how to stop fb from turning every single stupid like and interest into a community < PROPFEMALE > ? 
So now it seems that whenever I hold the new wawa baby , < PROPFEMALE > ( short for < PROPFEMALE > mel Machiatto , if that's how you spell it ) , neither of my other dogs wants to be near me . Sad , really . =( \ 
But I'm sure they'll both get used to her eventually . 
Quote/Story of the Day :\ 
Me : Last night I got 3 & 1/2 hours of sleep . \ 
Vianni : Yeah , I've done that before . It's weird . \ 
Me : Yeah ... it's like , you just feel a bit off . * I look off into the corner of the room in a daze , look back*\ 
Vianni : Was that one of those off moments ? \ 
Me : Yeah . 
This Farmville/Frontiersville thing is confusing . I might give up pretty quick . 
< PROPFEMALE > isl earning so fast . Much faster than my other two dogs ... she now knows how to go potty outside , chew on her bones , eat her own food , go on the pads .... and she is SO independent ! I think I'll post some pictures of her tomorrow . Now is the time to finish up hw before bed . 
Vianni , if you're reading this , I want my cheesecake . >.> \ 
No good sweets in the house . Night everybody ~ 
Another day , another < PROPMALE > at life gone by , so fast ...... =) \ 
I never waste mine . 
YAAAAY ! Late night English essay time ! Brb ~ 
I love that \Watchin ' and Waitin'\ " song from Phineas and Ferb . ^^ " 
Det er helgen , alle ! JEG er SÅ takknemlig ! For øvrig , JEG elske nordmannen omgangsspråk nå . Vikings alltid . ^^ Det er rettferdig < PROPFEMALE > nyest besettelse . takk for ideen , Kaie Murillo og < PROPMALE > Pucci ! 
Quote/Story of the day :\ 
Ben : I wonder who's playing the piano back there ? \ 
Me : I don't know , but if it's sad and emotional , it's < PROPFIRST > . \ 
Ben : But that IS sad and emotional .... \ 
Me : Yeah . Then it's < PROPFIRST > . 
If you're active and I know you well enough , you WILL be commented on . ^^ 
Stoopid ugly derned cha\ 
t box thing . Half of the messages you put into it , it responds : \An error has occurred . Please try logging in again . \"" 
NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONNONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONNOOOOOOOOOOO ! My necklace broke ! And I can't fix it this time at all because I can't find the little link that broke ! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! Dude , that necklace was my favorite ... and it meant something , too .... and I do not want to get a new chain . I like the old one . What can I do ?! 
Dang , after reading what < PROPFEMALE > was saying in the comments on < PROPFIRST>'s status , I REALLY want to have a debate with her ! If anyone else would care for a good round , pick your poison .... Religion , or Politics ? Heheheh ! 
Not that I had been counting , but looking over the photo shoot , I think < PROPMALE > was in at least HALF of all the pictures . We love you , < PROPMALE > . ;-P 
The more people you add , the more soopid news you have to < PROPMALE > on the feed < PROPFEMALE > . DX I always feel like I have to read EVERYTHING or I'll miss something ! Heeeelppppp meeeeee ...... 
GRRR ! The derned puppy , < PROPFEMALE > , just LOVES to chew on the carpet ! She ' already worn away a corner and started tearing it off .... the sad part is , she does it right in front of me ! T.T ; 
Everyone go to Luze < PROPFEMALE > Garcia's < PROPFEMALE > . She has the most retarrrded videos EVAR !!! I'm still laughing ! 
I really hate this . Whenever people say something , it's like I feel every drip of emotion behind it . If someone says something mean with malcontent behind it , I FEEL it .... it makes me want to shrivel up and die . If someone gets mad , I actually FEEL their anger , frustration , and fury , and I just back down .. When someone is happy , I FEED off of that energy . Does anyone else get this at all ? 
wants some nice fb chat . =P 
EVERYONE take the personality test ! It's very fun and helps you get to know people around you a lot ! And they're thought-provoking . ^^ 
OMG I JUST CHECKED ON SEREBII . NET ! THE FIFTH GENERATION INFO IS OUT !!!! OMGGGGG ! \ 
Dude ! All the new pokes have CRAZY weird stats ! And the Dream World gives some fantastically ( strange ) new abilities ! Drizzle/Drought Politoed/Ninetails anyone ? 
Water has a taste . I do not care what anyone might say . It . Is . Scrumptious . 
Just to let everyone know , I'm generally not a good person to pull phone pranks on .... I hardly EVER answer my phone at home , LOL . I just checked my voicemail and had a call from someone about a mattress ....? I called the number and on the \Not here right now\ " message I think I heard the name AJ ? o.O \ 
September is cancer month : In memory of every cancer patient , family \ 
member and friend who has lost their battle with cancer and in honor of \ 
those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love \ 
someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste , I did . Will \ 
you ? Prayers to all cancer patients and families . 
Ya know , I used to review every last comment whenever I missed a day/hour of fb . Now I think 100+ friends is making that difficult . Trolling comment days are over . >.<; 
Sometimes I wonder why people who seem like such jerks have any friends at all . And it really sucks when you see someone who was innocent become corrupted by those kinds of people . 
If all the signals I'm picking up from all yallz fb posts and real life events are right .... I don't think I'll ever quite get you love sick puppies . ^ . ~ \ 
So much drama . Just end it already . Geeze . 
Gj today everone in MM , SU , and InMotion ! I'm glad it's break ... now I can finally sleep like there's no tomorrow and procrastinate for a while without any worry . ^.^ 
I wonder . Am I like the only one who sits home all day after school and stuff ? You guys all have sooo much fun . I gotta get out more . =P 
needs to go to bed . Hopes he'll have a nice adventure dream . Hopes that it involves a certain fantasty he's always wanted , too . Is it possible to do that ....? 
So I'm searching online for the FFVII movie and decide to review the original FFVII plot . I see a picture of the part where Sephiroth kills Aeris .... brings back soooo much heartache . SHE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE ! DX\ 
I swear I was never emotional over a video game , but for that moment . 
You know giving your dog a bath is intense when you're wetter than they are . Omg , the puppy was SCREAMING like she was being skinned alive , but as soon as she's out , she's fine again . T.T 
Copy\ 
this onto your status and see what people rate you ! ( 1 ) ghetto ( 2 ) wish\ 
we went out ( 3 ) talkative ( 4 ) sarcastic ( 5 ) loveable ( 6 ) crazy ( 7 ) i \ 
want you ( 8 ) spoilt ( 9 ) great parent ( 10 ) wild ( 11 ) funny ( 12 ) beautiful\

And since I have seen a lot of people doing this and having gotten some nice replies , I'll do it too . Truth is .... ( like this status and I'll tell you ! ) 
Anyone know how to get picture from your phone on fb ? I got one of < PROPMALE > from last year as the chola girl ! 
I love debates , ohhh so much , even if I do wind up wrong , they're always elightening . <3 
Am I the only one who dreads going onto facebook every morning for fear of seeing \Most Recent ( 300+) ? \"" 
Scenario : You are in an ancient < PROPFEMALE > ruin trying to find your way out located somewhere deep within your PB & J sandwich . You come to a crossroads . There are three guardians , one guarding the entrance to each of the three passageways . One is < PROPFIRST > , and he says , \In order to go my way you must first play ' knives n ' pointy things ' with me all day . \"" 
The \ 
second guardian is < PROPFIRST > , and he says , \To go this route 
Just when I start to think the puppy is pretty smart , she goes and pees/poops on the carpet in front of me and chews on the straws of these lil ' eco-friendly cups we have ... T.T ; 
Rules of the internet :\ 
All \girls\ " are men . \ 
Wow I thought those would be some stupid \that's what she said\ " jokes .... do NOT try that \ " 10 things you should not do during ... \ " whatever . " 
I love how whenever m , y dog < PROPFEMALE > licks the other , < PROPFEMALE > , and when she does something wrong , she first bites her on the jugular and then keeps licking her . =P 
Tell me if we have 2 weeks for break , not one .... I always get freaked out for some reason during the end of the first week of every break about going back to school .... 
I think something is wrong with facebook ..... I keep getting newish looking posts where all the old ones should be . 
Just wanted to say that I think whoever answered \no\ " to the Truth Game question on whether or not I'd look good in a miniskirt has POOR taste . And they are insecure of my explicit beauty . =D " 
I just realized every time I use my 2nd favorite emoticon , =D , it doesn't necessarily look like a smile .... now I have to use =) so I don't make people think the wrong thing . Dear God , I have used that sooo many times .... 
Brother Bear might just be the most sappy Disney movie ever ..... but it's good . =P 
\You think YOUR lag is bad ? It took Jesus three days to re spawn ! \"" 
I think Fall is my favorite season . Crunchy , colorful leaves . Warm soups , teas , blankets . Partly clouded skies with a slight chill in the air . Thanksgiving ..... yeah . =P 
FIRST PERSON TO CHAT ME GETS $ 89,379,825,238,568,932 ! 
Does anyone here in AP Bio know where I can get an extra copy of the \I'm so Hormonal ! \ " EC ? I tried the teacher web thing . " 
Haha , I was just listening to my neighbor < PROPFIRST > and these two other old , I dunno what you'd call them , but they were christian and were trying to convert him , haha . He's christian , too , from what I understood , but he has a much broader understanding of God and doesn't subscribe to the < PROPFEMALE > view . Very funny , because you could tell they were traditionalists . 
Done reading all tha people's facebook posts , now I either play monopoly or play monopoly . Which do I choose ....? 
God knows the worst thing in the world is to dicipline a puppy . =( \ 
Such cute , cute eys and ears and a sweet little , slightly vertically lopsided head .... 
So apparently there's a LAKE under the Great Pyramid ! And it has a sarcophagus sunk inside it ! Clear water , too . But , the coffin was empty . According to a legend , it was supposed to house the body of a God . 
Off to read about < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > now . XD 
You know those dreams you sometimes have where you go on this epic adventure ? Go to strange new places , meet new people , defeat some great evil while encountering emotional drama over a lost companion , near-deaths , love triangles ? I wish I would have one tonight .... I haven't in a while . 
I swear that sometimes when I look in the mirror , I look better than a supermodel . ^ . ~ 
I desperately need to borrow a recording device ( preferably digital ) during lunch tomorrow for the APUSH project , because I just found out my mom's tape recrder is dead . If anyone could offer help , I'd gladly pay them 5$ ..... seriously . 
Never mind now , crisis solved ! I was able to download a free bit of recording software , and it works beautifully . 
Lol , that was the weirdest prank call ever . =P \You sound kinda cute 
You know , it's funny , but every once in a while you come across these wonderful political articles written by people who really know what they're talking about , who have a level head and try to give the benefit of the doubt . This pretty much sums up my view of Obama . \

I love random youtube vids . =P \

<3 Llamas With Hats ! 
I don't know what it is about vests , but somehow they just seem to say , \How can I help you ? \ " I walked into Wal-Mart with mummy wearing the Machine performance outfit for Saulte to Teachers to get some rice n ' things . I got stopped twice while being asked for help . " 
ARMPIT RASH FROM DEODORANT !!! AHHHH !!!!! So , APUSH group , where will we meet tomorrow ? < PROPMALE>'s house/park , if a park , which park ? Remember , not somewhere too far , becuase we have to do all this before around 2:40 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. , at which times < PROPFEMALE > and then I will be leaving . 
Today's performance at Salute to Teachers was great ... homecoming dance was great .... today was great ..... life is great . =) 
Shaved for the FIRST time today ... it feels ... liberating .... and I feel like a MAN ! >=O 
APUSH people except < PROPFEMALE > , I sent you all the final version of the lyrics . Make corrections , look for pictures for each part ( look for about eight , since we should use somewhere around seven of our own shots ) and send em ' to Ricardo .... osunarick @yahoo 
My two older chihuahuas are both going through heat at the same time . No studs around . They won't stop humping each other . 
I\ 
know and love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will \ 
understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice- people who are \ 
gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% \ 
won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one\ 
hour ? 
Wish someone was as into pokemon as I am . ); 
China .... you suck . =( \

The most frustrating thing about getting a lot of A's is when you get one or two B's that you know shouldn't be there . 
Been a couple jerks on facebook lately . First < PROPFEMALE > on < PROPFIRST>'s status , the this < PROPFIRST > guy on < PROPMALE>'s . Hope it doesn't become a trend .... 
Naruto rocks ... I don't care what anyone says , because that only means that they have not watched it yet . For anyone who's seen or knows enough about the first season , here is a site that has all of the second so far fresh from Japan , although it's all voiced-over in Japanese with English subtitles . You get used to it . But the coolness never fades . \

Now that I've caught up to episode 182 of Naruto Shippuden , life has temporarily lost its meaning . At least , until next week .... when another episode comes out . 
So I'm trying to write the draft of the Gatsby essay . And I think I've found the Eighth Deadly Sin : Facebooking . So now I am making a commitment to log out for the rest of the night to finish it . This will be my last update . I am stronger than you , Social Networking demon ! 
Why is it that every single stupid time I pull up a different < PROPFEMALE > that stupid fb makes all the profile pics look blurry and nasty ?! 
I've always kind of thought this , but was never able to put it into words . Everyone needs respect , everyone needs dignity and compassion . Everyone is holy in their own way . You don't need to \believe\ " in God to have or know that there is one if you do believe in one thing : love . \ 
Not saying this to anybody in particular , but you might wanna pay attention anyway . If you're gonna make a post about how sad you are , how someone apparently hurt you , drama , etc . ( in whatever poetic form you may so choose ) , then you'd better be willing to explain why and spill the beans cuz it's really sad and annoying if you only put it up to get attention . 
Norge er mitt favorittland . Her er noen av årsakene . Kaldt\ 
klima , kult hus , tonnevis av skog og naturlig skjønnhet , 98% grønn \ 
elektrisitet , stabil økonomi fra en stor regnværsdag fond , en av de \ 
høyeste GPA per innbygger , en av de høyeste levestandard , lav \ 
befolkning , lav kriminalitet , mange mennesker der som allerede snakker engelsk , Viking historie .... går jeg trenger på ? \

So I kinda missed looking into the governors before < PROPFIRST > Brown was elected . Could someone fill me in on the new guy's political history and why they thought he might have been chosen over Whitman ? 
Homemade Butternut Squash Soup Recipe :\ 
Take some pre cut squash , heat it in the micro with a cover for around 12 minutes . Take a blender , add about 4 handfuls of shredded mild cheddar cheese , a couple tablespoons of salt , vegetable base , blend . Enjoy . 
Try this . Stick your hands in the freezer until frostbite starts to set in , then run them under hot water . They should buzz afterward ... it's weird . =P 
Just made more butternut squash soup . And it's 1000x better this time around . As if the last batch weren't enough . =P 
Who would like to revise my English essay for a neo-criticism on Gatsby ? =P 
Just rediscovered how cool I remembered Runescape being . And how much I wished I was a member . 
Just so ya know , yallz just got Peanu Butterd ' . 
Read half of yallz status updates . And half of them are wassups . I think there's a cycle here .... every two or three months everyone either gets reeeeeally emotional or decides to do these encouraging status trends .... 
Just popped like 5 big zits ... one on my nose , one on my ear , and like 3 on my forehead . They were more like the hard kind that don't produce much volume in squirt , but the ferocity with which they squirt is very satisfying . ^ . ~ 
For anyone who knows < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ( or has her as their friend ) , doesn't she look JUST like < PROPFEMALE > Chaco in her profile pic ? o.O 
Food for thought . Is immortality ethical ? 
If anyone's read The Crucible I'd appreciate a little rundown so I don't have to ? =P 
Everyone should go see < PROPMALE>'s video of his pets . It's just plain sweet . =) 
What have I accomplished today ...? Getting my smithing level from 34 to 44 on RS today , picked up all the doggie pooh in the yard , ate some good ' taters n ' eggs with SALSA ( which oddly enough almost smelled like turds themselves as I walked back in the door ) , watched some Spongebob and other cartoons I barely remember , and APUSH hw . =)

God , finally . Really , I'm surprised it took this long . Expect official legislation to be coming soon ~ 
As much as I have loved the Naruto : Shippuden series so far , the recent few episodes after Pain's death really have seemed almost pointless except for stalling while they come up with some new thing for Naruto to do . =( 
Not exactly a cartoon character , but I always thought Link was the most epic of epic video game characters . XD 
Is it just me or can anyone else imagine < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > as the little apprentice to the hero in cartoons like American Dragon or < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Adventures ? =) 
If you're anybody , come and watch one Sound Unlimited and Music Machine's BIGGEST performances tonight , 6:20 p.m. , at Balboa Park's Organ Pavilion ! 
Piceno's Math Analysis peeps : are the tests starting tomorrow or thursday ? 
NEW DREAM ~ ! Live in Norway inside a DOME ! Domes are the strongest possible self-supporting structure that you can build on a flat surface , giving you the most volume per unit of construction material you put in , not including furniture . Durable , earthquake-proof , easy to light the interior w/ windows , totally green , can last for centuries , boastable , interesting floor plan , what more can you want ?! 
Dear Makers of V8 , \ 
You should really learn that every time you try a variation on the original , it will SUCK . \ 
Sincerely , \

So far , my score on Data Worm is UNTOUCHABLE ! BUWARHARHARHARHARRRRR ! 
Sprite-flavored chap stick does in fact smell ( and presumably taste ) like Sprite , but somehow and some way ... it just seems kinda toxic to me ... 
Anyone remember when the Machine party is ...? 
< PROPFEMALE > geek talk . <3 
is ripping huge chunks of skin off his toes . 
Home made ' tater soup . Thank you , mumzy . =P 
Anyone remember those white firemen that got denied of promotions because even though they had higher test scores , the black dude got promoted since he was black ? What happened to them ? 
Type your name : Morgan\ 
With your elbow : aM , aortgan\ 
With your nose : MJo9rgtqahj\ 
With your eyes closed : MoefB\ 
Put this as your status don't erase your mistake !! 
If I don't come in to Machine tomorrow , would someone tell Ms. Ronacher I ' really sick ? 
Three months of Runescape membership and at no cost to me , all thanks to one blessed man - Jojo Rodriguez . May the heavens cry out his name for the eternities to come . XD 
Just wondering . But is anyone else as OCD as me to have to look at EVERY new status under \most recent\ " until they're able to move on ?! " 
What happened to my status ?! I posted one , deleted it to edit it , posted again and then saw three copies ( one was the original ) and now there's none ! CURSE YOU ZUCKERBERG ! 
Thank God for smart gay old men . Just had a FANTASTIC evening with a great conversationalist , intellectual , and jokester all in one . 
I can be loooooonely now the rain is gone ! Oh wait those aren't the words lol . 
NEW FIREFOX WALLPAPER ! Grey tiger with crazy blue eyes . <3 
Oh that we could simply plug our brains directly into one another to be able to fully comprehend someone else's true thoughts and feelings . So much less fighting and in its place so much more love . 
I think I would be more in to today's kind of music if bands these days didn't just so often take only a few repeating chords and notes and just add \buildup\ " to them and call it a song . " 
Facebook , stop telling me I haven't read statuses that I've seen at least ten times today . 
Me : \Anything ending in \"- us\ " is technically supposed to be pluralized with an \"- i 
It's a little sad when you have nothing else to describe someone other than \capable\ " in those tag things . =) " 
Zomg Rush Hour asian skillz . =P 
Runescape was great , and I think I got a couple shades more pale ! =P \ 
But ... it's nice to get back to real life every ONCE in a while ... 
OMG WORLD VEGETARIAN DAY ! YUSSS ! =D 
So ... discussion of the day : \ 
Should we spank our children ? Yes/No and why . 
Black Swan ... just ... dang . 
Thanks guys . =) 
Funny how my nose keeps running and I have to walk over to the hall to grab a snot rag , but the minute I decide to keep one near me , it stops . Evil nose . 
Here I am , holding a bit of food , and my sweet chihuahua decides to sit in my lap out of the goodness of her black little heart . Her kind gesture didn't last long past my consumption of it . 
Last post of the night : what is this I taste under my fingernail ? 
Kinda funny how people seem to have no trouble talking about their personal relationships on fb , but as soon as you see them in public , they're dead silent . o.O \ 
Case in point : Those \Blah Blah is Single\ " updates that everyone's like \ " ZOMGOSH NUUU ! \ " on . " 
Woman , youse mah fish ! 
Just realized today , the special Naruto : Shippuden double feature came out . The high Ninja Council will be meeting to finally settle the terrorist issue Sasuke and the Acatsuki remnants are creating . =) \ 
But , it's late . I'll save that little treat for tomorrow . G'night , errbody . 
For anyone in Gomez M/W/F ToK , what was that book called that < PROPFEMALE > and someone talked about ? It's the one where everyone's invited to a mansion and then a bunch of murders happen and junk and a lot of parodies are based off of ... i.e. Family Guy's \And Then There Were Fewer\ " episode . " 
Name : Zombie Yeti\ 
Description : Little is known about the Zombie Yeti other than his name , birth date , social security number , education history , past work experience and sandwich reference ( roast beef and swiss ) . \ 
Lol Plants vs . Zombies . =P 
Hmm , so little activity on facebook recently . Normally by this time I log on , there's at least another 150 updates under Most Recent to read through ... sometimes 300+ . Is everyone going cold turkey or something ? o.O 
I really wanted to watch tonight's Glee episode , but I was at the laundry mat and a kid was messing with all the channels so I didn't want to be rude . =( \ 
Oh well . I got at least part of the juicy bits . 
I just figured out what the emote \= DD\ " could be . Either a twin-headed ... uhh ... male reproductive organ ... or a smiling fat man/woman with extra < PROPFEMALE > pudge . " 
... Is it pretentious to like your own comments/statuses ? 
Yallz need tuh lern 2 quote when you quote in yo statuseez ! 
Wisdom speaking here . Quote follows below . 
Government sponsored education is a horribly twisted institution that has corrupted learning with all its stupid homework , papers , tests and projects by punishing those who would rather have wholesome lives without the busywork , all the while dangling the threat of a future on the street with a cardboard box for shelter should you fail . I'm really starting to dislike school . 
Nummy yummy for my tummy . Salsa is good . 
Mmm , I dunno about anyone else ... but why the heck would you add anybody you don't know ? o.O That's like , creeper status . Moreso than I . =) 
Wild Russia . <3 
Proper grammar and punctuation are a rarity online these days ... 
Heaven is a decaffeinated cup of coffee with chocolate raspberry creamer . Maybe some whipped cream on top . 
Bloody Eagles are siiiiick ! 
No tea may taste any different whether it comes in a tin cup or < PROPFEMALE > chalice ... but it sure does look a heck of a lot fancier . =) 
Yes , I am bored and have nothing better to do . But that does not change the fact that reality TV drama is clearly anything BUT real . Ms. Kardashian , you have disappointed me . 
I kinda wish I was an Airbender in the Avatar world before they all got slaughtered besides Aang ... wandering the world to do whatever the heck you want without any strings or stress sounds kinda nice . 
You are an automatic idol of mine if you have nice , milky skin . =) 
Creepy old men looking for partners on a Yahoo ! news blog . 
Tomorrow is a new day . A time to forget the mistakes of now , because they're past , and that is where they should stay . 
Lol , most people are voting for gay rights and marijuana legalization on that voting thing ... I get gay rights , but why the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? o.O ; 
I need to see something funny/entertaining . Any recommendations ? 
Is watching the surprising failure that is the < PROPMALE > Show out of sheer pity .
