HALLELUJAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M DONE WITH PRECALCULUS !!! woooohoooooo !!!!! :D 
why is it so hard to motivate myself to clean my room ...? i always end up finding something to pay with instead .... kind of like a 2-yr-old . 
is anyone else addicted to scrabble ..... or am i just nerdy like that ....? 
why do wisdom teeth have to hurt like hell when they're coming in ...? why can't i just randomly have extra knowledge instead ? 
I just dyed Jullie's hair . Hopefully I didn't mess it up .... 20 more minutes , and we'll find out ....... 
why does life have to be stressful and frustrating ? 
i love games !!!! i think it's becoming a problem , lol 
sometimes a really good laugh just makes my whole day so much more fun ! =] 
i just signed up for my classes . i got the last spot in the calculus class i wanted !!! yay !! it's definitely going to be a full semester . i'm taking 17 units ( maybe 20 if i can get into the history class ... ) ..... we'll see how studious i can be before i conveniently drop one .... or three .... classes . lol ;) 
you know .... getting a root canal really isn't as bad as i thought . 
why does life have to be so f***ing difficult and frustrating all the time . .. 
i really need to get control of my insomnia tendencies .... 
you know , it's very satisfying to be able to do stuff for yourself . i just did my own oil change in my car , and re-wired my mom's phone charger cuz the cat chewed it in half ! :) 
I'm excited about my Italian class !! The only thing that sucks is I can't B.S. my way through it and hardly study like I can with my math classes . lol 
being sick sucks !! although it is amusing to have a man-voice , lol 
loves going to comedy clubs !! i mean really .... who doesn't love to laugh ??!!!!

Why does every little thing irritate me lately ??!!!! What happened to the fun , easygoing , < PROPFEMALE > ...? 
why are things so difficult sometimes ?

Ugh !! I need new glasses . These keep giving me < PROPMALE > migranes , which is not fun at all , its extremely frustrating !! 
Oops ...!! I did it again .... The sun is already rising , and I'm only just now going to bed . I swear , seriously , this is the last time .... for reals !!! 
one of these days i will figure things out ( ......... hopefully ........... ) 
i'm so confused .... the sun is out , it's like 90-something degrees outside ( and inside my house .. it sucks when the AC doesn't work !! ) , it's humid as hell , and yet ..... it's raining .......!!! \ 
did i miss something here ....??? i live in california , but i feel like i'm in the south right now ! it's so weird !!! 
can i just say ... the \rocky horror picture show\ " in LA last night .... A-MAZING !!!! " 
From December 1st to 25th change your profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . The goal of the game ? is to see no human face on facebook but an invasion of memories for the fight AGAINST CHILD ABUSE . Pass it to your friends ! 
why is it that i always procrastinate on everything ...? lol
