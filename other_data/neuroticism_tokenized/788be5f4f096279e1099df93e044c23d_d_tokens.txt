Back from the VA . Glad I am off work tommorrow . 

Happy fourth everybody . 
Going to bed now . One of my fav docs has a LONG day for me tommorrow . Hope he appreciates it . 
Nothing like a 14 hour work day to make you rethink your career choices . Nite all . 
My daughter < PROPFEMALE > was in a car accident today . She is in the trauma stepdown unit at Vanderbilt now . She has a post trauma concussion , a small laceration on her forehead and hairline fracture on her pelvis . I have never been more thankful in my life that one of my children is only hurt that much . Hopefully she will be going home tomorrow or Sunday . Scared the s#*t out of me . 
< PROPFEMALE > is doing a bit better today . She left the trauma step down unit and was sent to a regular hospital room . No idea when she will go home . She is having some memory problems . She can't remember the accident ( not uncommon ) but also can't remember why she is in the hospital ( she has been told several times ) . Doc's are doing futher testing . Hopefully she will be home Monday . Thanks for all your prayers . 
< PROPFEMALE > went home yesterday . She is staying with her mom now . She is upset because her computer broke in the crash . Told her to relax and just get better . The only thing broken was a computer screen . I can live with that .
