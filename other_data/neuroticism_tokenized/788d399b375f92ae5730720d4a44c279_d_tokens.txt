rambling thought : i never considered myself a model . i like to think of myself as a muse . an actress even . the girl in me always wanted a pretty picture but the real me wanted something with a little power . a little push . something emotional , creepy , or just all out strange . i know a million girls with better bodies and prettier faces . and i'll never have 34 inch hips and it's ok ... because i can cry on demand . ;-)

Love is not breathlessness , not excitement , not the promulgation of eternal passion . That is just being in love , which any fool can do . Love is what is left over when being in love has burned away , this is both an < PROPMALE > and a fortunate accident . Those that truly love have roots that grow towards each other , when all the pretty blossoms have fallen from their branches they find that they are one tree and not two . 
http://www.hypnoid.com/psytest2.html a weird personality test ... post your result !

tomorrow and thursday are gonna be ugly . :( 
ok , dude , seriously . i gotta get this boredom/stress/hormonal eating under control . i feel like i should be chewing cud in a pasture right now . 
this morning shall now be referred to as Guessfest 2011 . 
do you know what annoys me ? an exam question where 2 of the choices differ by 3/100s of a gram of an INACTIVE ingredient in a 2 gram TOTAL ( 1.5 freaking %) of a SUPPOSITORY that's gonna go through first pass metabolism anyway . this is comparable to adding an extra . 15 cup of water to a gallon of kool-aid . OH THE HORROR . k , im done . 
ohmygoooosh . i swear , if it's not pharmacology then it's pharmaceutics .. :( 
any of my craft/sewing-savvy friends know where i can find lace/beaded wedding appliques for dresses besides online or micheals/ joannes ? do wedding dress stores sell them ? 
man i less than three java monster . paired with some lamb of god . happy friday folks . 
omg hes wearing a bowtie . <3 
sweeeet , an applique i ordered online ( and was a little scared about doing so ) came in and it's GORGEOUS :D \ 
by the time im done with all of this , im gonna have so many buttons and brooches and sequins and lace and glitter im gonna be able to open by own craft store . 
for people getting married int he future .... square envelopes are considered \odd shaped\ " by the postal service . and if their over 6\ " they are considered large . so be prepared to pay double postage for each one . >.<" 
so today was the last day of class . wow . 
were always searching for somebody to complete us . after a few years or few months of a relationship , we blame our partners & take up with somebody more promising . this can go on & on , until we admit that a partner can add dimensions to our life , we are responsible for our own fulfillment . nobody else can provide it for us , to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves & program for failure every relationship we enter 
after a few urgent emails , i filled out all of my paperwork , made phone calls , and got my ducks in a row for my rotation at duke . only to be informed by my preceptor that i couldn't turn anything in until october . \ 
thanks guys . as if the incessant magnus emails weren't enough . 
< PROPFIRST > and i were woken up at 3 am last night by what we believe was a wounded , screaming pterodactyl . 
EXHAUSTED

my dog knows how to unzip bags . it drives me crazy but i think it's so cute at the same time ... until i find a wad of chewed strawberry gum stuck on her < PROPFEMALE > 
study study and see mali today :D 
this semester i've calculated what i need to make on my final to only pass the class , not what i need to make an A or a B . i'm slightly preoccupied , and besides-aiming low rarely results in disappointment .

i just found 2 barley wines hiding in the back of the fridge . 
when i was young we didn't have cable . we didn't get much tv ... i do remember staying up every friday night , waiting for daddy to get home , and we would watch the twilight zone ( until like 10 ! which made 5 year old me think i was hot stuff ) . i think this sparked my love for science . ( which was later confirmed with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > in ghostbusters-but thats a story for another time ) 
going with my mom today to pick out her dress and we got the girls ' dresses picked out ! ( one is strapless and the other is one-shoulder ... thats all i will reveal ;-) ) ahhhhhhhh ... its coming together all too quickly .

I have too much to lose , she said , if I cross that line . Like what ? I said . She could not think of anything that day so she said she'd get back to me . Since then I've been thinking what I would lose if I cross my line & I haven't come up with anything either . There's always another line somewhere . ( B . < PROPMALE > ) 
random < PROPFEMALE > fact #3 . i have a box of plastic forks in my car solely for when i buy ice cream because i simply cannot wait to get home .

today i gotta go get dance pants . aka bloomers . i honestly would have never thought i would be doing this at 27 years old ..... nap first though . 
cod made a revelation . we gave a lot of our vendors creative license to do what they want for the wedding ( after all they know what they can do best ) . we gave them pictures of things we love , things we hate , things we HAVE to have ( eg HAVE to have chandeliers ) , the feel we're going for etc etc .... so when they day comes we're gonna be just as surprised as the guests are :P it's pretty cool actually . 
last night i dreamed that i was one of 20 picked individuals to become a part of a big project . we were put through a series of tests and physical assessments and it was narrowed it to 5 . they sent us to a secret government building(similar to men in black ) . if we wanted to leave it had to be right then , there was no turning back . we stayed . they gave us our badges : we were power rangers . saber toothed tiger bitches .

one of the many halloween ideas that cod and i have come up with but never did ( yet ): one person dresses up as a bowling ball . 10 others dress up as bowling pins . we scatter at the beginning of the night . whenever the bowling ball sees a pin- he chases after it while the pin screams bloody murder . 
it begins . 
the chemistry between us could destroy this place .

\were listening to nothing but boy bands all day long\ " .... this was just said by 2 people in this house . and it's not me or nici . "

“Oh God , are there so many of them in our land ! Students who can’t be happy until they’ve graduated , servicemen who can’t be happy until they are discharged , single folks who can’t be happy until they’ve found a mate , workers who can’t be happy until they’ve retired , adolescents who aren’t happy until they’re grown , ill people who aren’t happy until they’re well , failures who aren’t happy until they succeed , restless who can’t wait until they get out of town , and in most cases , vice versa , people waiting , waiting for the world to begin . ” ( T . Robbins ) 
I was able to reference Damarcus Ware , < PROPFEMALE > White , and < PROPFEMALE > Fanning on my test today . Booya .
