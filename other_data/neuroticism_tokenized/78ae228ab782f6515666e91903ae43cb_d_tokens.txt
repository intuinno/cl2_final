Wishing i could just go to sleep right now and forget about the last 3 days .... wake up tomorrow and it just be a bad dream :( im emotionally drained and sooooo confused ?! 
Completely broken :( 
Trying to pull myself together .... I cant believe this is my reality .... 
Shes left and kams gone too :( how did i not see this comin ??? 
Wish i could just breathe .... What do u do when ur heart and soul have been ripped out ? 
CEO of my own life ! 
What a gorgeous morning !! Sooo excited .... I get to see an old friend today i havent seen in a couple yrs !! 
What a spectacular day so far !! I miss my daughter something fierce but i know she knows mommy loves her and i'll see her soon !! Keepin my spirits high and feeling liberated thanks to my amazing friends and family !! 
Nothing replaces my daughters face & bein w/ her every day but the amazing ppl in my life help me hold my < PROPFEMALE > high & remind me of the great person I am ! I've fought HARD , shed blood sweat & many tears to make it to where I am ; stable , independent , confident , successful & proud ! All things I (& many others ) feared I may never have once upon a time . So PROUD I proved us all wrong ! NO ONE can take that from me ! 
Watchin late night movies with my rad son < PROPFIRST > !!! One lucky mama :) 
My daughter turns one tomorrow and i still havent seen her :( this is killin my heart .... Im havin a rough morning shaking and throwin up :( im doing everything to keep my < PROPFEMALE > up but inside im shattered ..... 
Couldnt sleep ... up thinking about my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > all night . i cant believe shes one today it seems like just yesterday i was cutting her umbilical cord and was the first person to touch her ... :( hope i see her mommy loves u baby 
Miss my daughter :( she turned one today and still have not seen her .... Wondering how a mother could live with herself and sleep thru the night while doing this to two innocent children ....?? 
Picking up the pieces .... 
Cant continue to thank god enough for the family and friends i am so blessed to have . I know i must've done something right because most ppl can count on one hand only the true loved ones they have ... I cant even begin to count :) 
off to a really rough start today :( the pain and vomiting ( from having crohns ) is almost imbearable ..... My body cannot handle this stress . But im a fighter and all i can do is keep pushing forward .

Had an amazing reiki session :) feeling centered ! 
Wow .... God never ceases to amaze me with his blessings and love for me !! :) its so true ... Let go and let god !!! 
Sad when a mother is ripped from her daughter and has to learn thru stupid status updates about her daughters firsts .... Apparently she started waving and trying to say bye bye today . * god < PROPMALE > me the strength < PROPFEMALE > and understanding to get thru this , please . Amen * 
Started off the day with a very inspirational client :) i love mornings like that !! spending the day alone ... wishing i was on the west coast !!! :)

\just another manic monday .... whoooaaaa ! \""

4 weeks without seeing my daughters beautiful face ..... I try to be strong but .... Im dying inside . I imagine having my heart removed from my chest with a spork would feel better than this .... 
I MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OR THE \ 
SEXIEST ... NOR HAVE THE MOST PERFECT BODY . I MIGHT NOT BE ANYONE'S FIRST \ 
CHOICE BUT I AM A GREAT CHOICE . I DON'T PRETEND TO BE SOMEONE ELSE \ 
BECAUSE I'M TOO GOOD AT BEING ME . I MIGHT NOT BE PROUD OF SOME OF THE \ 
THINGS I'VE DONE ... BUT I AM PROUD OF WHO I AM TODAY , and WHO I AM \ 
BECOMING - TAKE ME AS I AM OR DON'T TAKE ME AT ALL . 
Sunday cruisin along riverside ... Headed to a nice quiet dinner with my boos :) then gettin muh hurs did !! Hahaha 
\I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that \

Gosh what a gorgeous day out today :) drove out to my mamas and am headin home now ! Windows down , music up ... Whats better than that ?! 
We should take children's philosophy to heart . They do not despise a bubble because it burst ; they immediately get to work to blow another one !! 
Ahhhh REFRESHED ! Had to train the girls today at work which meant facial/organic peel for me !!! YAY ! DESPERATELY needed to relax ! I love my j-o-b .... if you can even call it that cause I feel like I get paid to do what I love and to play with people all day !!

After silence , that which comes nearest to expressing\ 
the inexpressible is music . 
Nearly 5 weeks since I saw my daughter ... Rah\ 
coontinues lying claiming I haven't given her her things ... All this\ 
drama and childish games is ridiculous ... THE ONLY PERSON SHE IS HURTING\ 
IS OUR DAUGHTER AND < PROPFIRST > ... But does she care ? NOPE ... only thing she cares \ 
about is being spiteful ....... 
Many people know so little about what is beyond their\ 
short range of experience . They look within themselves - and find \ 
nothing ! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside \ 
themselves either . 
Can definitely tell river/lake weather is fast approaching ... Only appts i had today were for bikini and brazilian waxing !! Gotta love that i get to torture ppl and get paid for it :) and gotta love that every single one tells me im the best they ever had !!!! Hahahaha :) 
Ok soooo .... Party for my friend < PROPFIRST > tonight , she graduates beauty school on tues !! My cars given me hell so i cant drive myself :( need a party < PROPMALE > willing to drive !!! Haha any takers !!!????

Extremely eventful night .... WOW ! 
\Love deeply and passionately . You might get hurt but it's the only \ 
What to do , what to do ?? Life just keeps shitting all over me but wtf can one do ?? I guess I'm gonna have to put on my big girl panties , strap on some shit kickers and keep on doing what I do best ..... wading thru the bullshit ! 
Don't aim for success if you want it ; just do what \ 
you love and believe in , and it will come naturally ! 
I just want to take the time to say I have the BEST nephew in the entire world ! < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > you are one of a kind and I am so PROUD of you < PROPFEMALE > ! You've have grown into such an amazing , caring , loving man !!! Aunty loves you and will always be here for you babe .... ALWAYS ! Cant wait to see you and get tattooed together ! XOXOXO

Another day of nothing but brazilian waxing .... yippeeee LOL ! \ 
Ok ppl so who's going with me to watch TwoLips Burlesk this weekend ???!!! You don't wanna miss out and this Aquatic event .... and you know you wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with me !!!! 
I just LOVE being judged & put on the chopping block by bible thumping hypocrits who have never even met me . CLEARLY U dont know about truly being christian . ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME ! \ 
I'm so blessed to have been raised by a family who knows the true meaning and raised me w/ unbreakable faith & love in my heart ! Dad , Mom , Gma < PROPFEMALE > ( R.I.P ) u gave me a strong foundation to build from that can NEVER be cracked . I love u !

damned if I do damned if I don't! I cancelled all my plans to stay home \

to entertain self =) 
REALLY wishing I could just move back home to Cali , to where my heart is .....

If you can't stand behind our soldiers and \ 
show them the support they deserve , then please feel free to stand in \

OMG so I wound up taking a nearly 4 hr nap and not doing anything with my day ! Guess I needed it . I can't even remember the last time I took a nap during the day .... weird . 
Strange morning ... first I wake up to a GIGANTIC camel cricket jumping on me . If you don't know what these crazy things are google it ... eeeek ! And now my poor Tito has been having an allergy/sneezing fit for the past 20 mins and he cant stop . I've never seen anything like it , poor guy cant breathe . Its freakin me out =( 
\I've never fooled \ 
\I want to grow old without facelifts . I want to have the courage to be\ 
WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS WORLD COMING TO ?? I got home and a kid my son barely knows is sitting on the curb and asks me for a place to stay the night . His parenst dumped him with ten dollars and told him to find a friend in the neighborhood to stay the night with ... they were going to a motel ... their house is under construction ... and to be back to their house tomorrow .... 
All people dream , but not equally . Those who dream by night in the dusty\ 
recesses of their mind wake in the morning to find that it was vanity . \ 
But the dreamers of the day are dangerous people , for they dream their \ 
dreams with open eyes , and make them come true . 
:( ever feel like u just cant get anything right ?? I know its not true , i have way more self respect to really believe that but tonight im certainly fighting those emotions ... Where's my fairytale ending ? 
A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause \ 
the birth of love . 
It's tradition for the President to lay a wreath\ 
in Arlington National Cemetery at theTomb of the UnknownSoldier on \ 
Memorial Day , but it didn't happen this year-Obama took a vacation to\ 
Chicago ! Way to show respect to those who have given their life to \ 
protect our country ! If you agree this is an insult to our\ 
soldiers and their families , please copy and post to your < PROPFEMALE > . 
\Don't let them say you aint beautiful ... They can all get F*&%$# just stay true to YOU !! \"" 
OMG I started off my day w/ a nearly 2 mile BAREFOOT job on burning Tulsa city side streets ( made of gravel mixed with cement ) bcuz my < PROPFEMALE > pin Tito took off like a bat outta hell & I couldnt catch him ... I now have 5 of the largest most PAINFUL blisters ( which are still getting worse ) and road burn on the soles of my feet & cannot walk w/out wantin to break things !! GRR =( 
One word ... OUCH !!!!!!!! 
NOTE TO SELF : running barefoot on burning asphalt is not something you want to do again ... EVER ... for ANY reason ! Putting shoes by the door in the event I need some in an emergency situation such as today !!! =( too bad shock collars are against my beliefs lol cause that lil guy is freakin FAST !!!

Havin a craptastic morning =( cant walk AT ALL gonna so im crawling ... i forgot to pay cricket yesterday w/ frying my feet and all so I woke up to no phone this morn ... Cant go pay it cuz I'm stranded on my couch ... grrrrr . Come on now ... Cut me some slack PLEASE ! I know I'm tough but sheeeeesh ! A lil break from all this craziness would be nice .... 
SO TRUE .. \U are 1 intense bitch . U are almost abnormally introspective but \ 
I do not want the peace which passeth understanding , I\

I LOVE my job BUT I'm getting extremely frustrated with my place of Employment ... I don't know how I'm expected to do my job with out the proper products and working machinery ! I dont even want to go to work today because all of my appts today require me sacrificing my standards and beliefs as a good esthetician ... I'm hanging on by a thread becuz I love my clients ... What to do ?? What to do ?? 
Yaaaay , NOT ... Get to start my day off with a Manzilian wax ( thats our funny way of saying male brazilian wax for all of u scratching your heads ... and YES that means EVERYTHING ! ) , that's always interesting ! Wish me luck ! What a way to kick off pride weekend huh ??!! < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , I think I'm gonna need those drinks girl !!!! 
All the adversity I've had in my life , all my \ 
troubles and obstacles , have strengthened me ... You may not realize it \ 
when it happens , but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the \ 
world for you . \

My Lil ' Man decided he wanted to come home tonight so I'm staying in for the night with him =) Gonna < PROPFEMALE > out , have some dinner , maybe play some wii ! He's by far the coolest kid ever !! OK OK maybe I'm biased !! 
Can < PROPMALE > truly separate you from friends ... If you \ 
want to be with someone you love , aren't you already there ? 
Tired of days like this ... Tired of my body attacking itself and being sick all the time ... Tired of self sacrifice when no one else gives a shit ... I need a positive environment ... 
Maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right\ 
regrets . 
Something I wrote when I was 14 ... Very much how I'm feeling now . \ 
A sign of sadness\ 
An indication of pain\ 
Symbols of sorrow \ 
That fall like rain\ 
Each drop of water\ 
Each single tear\ 
Signifies sadness\ 
And reveals inner fear\

Anyone know of any good spas looking for an Esthetician ?? Apparently we r closing our doors in 2 weeks .... 
8 weeks since I saw my beautiful baby girl and still no sign that it's ever going to happen =( will this pain ever subside ? will i ever be able to breathe without feeling like i have an elephant sitting on my chest ? everyone says it'll get easier but when ? cuz up til this point its only progressively gotten harder ... GOD , if you hear me , I tap out . I can't take anymore . Please . 
Put on my big girl panties and cleaned house all day ... Bleh , hate it ! BUT my house looks amazing ! Time to relax and try and kick this tension headache I've been fighting all day . Maybe watch a movie !

Had a great time with old friends last night =) Trying to squeeze in as much quality time with ppl I love before I leave ! I didn't do that before I left Cali because it happened so quickly , that was my only regret .... You should ALWAYS take the time for the ones you love .

Are we there yet ??

Really wish I could shake off this hurt ... but beginning to think that'll never happen . I don't think you ever really recover from pain like this ? Maybe all I can hope for is that with time and distance it begins to feel more like just a bad memory and the pain wont hurt as much ? 
For my tulsa friends who don't know franky @ bennetts or havent been tattooed by him ... He is an amazing artist and man and i suggest you go see him :) tell him cupcake sent you !!

( gotta love < PROPFEMALE > ) If you are a HANDFUL , re-post ! I dare you ........ I'll be looking for the ladies who re-post !

PISSED OFF THIS MORNING ! \ 
All I gotta say is ppl need to learn to BE REAL AND HONEST !! If you claim ppl are your best friends then you need to be honest with them . Not go acting a fool talking shit when you get caught up trying to make others look like liars and idiots . \ 
Why is that < PROPFEMALE > fuckin hard for ppl to grasp these days ?? HONESTY , INTEGRITY , MORALS , VALUES ... WTF happened to those things ? 
Wish i could say that with age comes wisdom and maturity ... but thats up to us as individuals to want to grow and learn and move forward . 
Hmmm , There's an old saying my Mama used to use , how's it go ....? Oh yes I remember \oh the tangled webs we weave ... \ " you know the rest ! " 
OMG my foot hurts :'( 
cliterally -- what comes out when on pain pills trying to talk and say clearly and literally at the same time . Bwahaha omg ! 
\Let's make a resolution . I'll drink to that . Let's always stay friends . Friendship is thicker than blood ... That depends ... Depents on trust . Depends on true devotion . Depends on love . Depends on not denying emotion ... \"" 
If I held my breath and waited on some supposed true friends to be true friends ... I'd suffocate ! Over it ! 
I'm at home 41st & union http://4sq.com/dUMSC9 
Its amazing to me how many ppl say \oh no you cant move we will miss you\ " blah blah blah ... yet I decide to stay an extra few months to take the time for friends and family and STILL no one takes the time for us . When I'm/We're gone I dont want to hear ANY whining !!! And NO you cant come visit on the island and stay with me for free when its conveinent for you in the future !!!!! "

My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores , go to church & school . They gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job and work for the things that I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school , at my job & to take pride in my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic & respect for the law , and my elders . I thank God everyday for my parents . Copy and paste if you had mean parents too

Parents think about their children day and night , even when they are grown . Parents love their children in a way that they will never understand . Parents will be there for their children when no one else will . Parents would take a bullet , stand in front of a train , and ask God to take them instead of their child . If you have a child or children that you love as much as I love mine , post this as your status .
