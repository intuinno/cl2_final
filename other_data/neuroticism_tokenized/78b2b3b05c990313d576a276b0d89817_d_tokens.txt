< PROPMALE > Daleiden Rediger and < PROPFIRST > Gotham are having an intense Pokemon battle . BYB 
Life's like an osyter , you gotta just go out there and shuck it ( Deep ...... ) 
Why enjoy a moment of pleasure , but screw yourself over for all enternity ? Remember , Someones always watching you ... 
In a world of Kelsos , be Hyde ! 
Still finding it ironic that only 2 days before our snow day we had snow . It was quite beautiful , got to write a poem . Deep .... 
< PROPFIRST > rocks 
Ugh must go 2 work . Come to < PROPMALE > Briqs please !!!! 
When it's tough , keep on keeping on . 
You might be a noob if you think you're winning when you're watching the video before you get to the start menu . 
You might be a noob if the only time you go into a gym is to try to get a Pokemon Badge . 
You know if you're a nerd if ... For your Sweet 16 , you want a X-wing fighter . 
I'm stuck in illinois 4 a week for bands of < PROPFEMALE > . Don't know anybody cept people I came with ( only actually know one person well and she's off ) Im missing the Badger state ... :-( 
< PROPFIRST > is a wildebeest ! 
Rocking rifle at bands of < PROPFEMALE > . To all my Wisconsinites back home , it's 98 degress and hot as heck down in Illinois . Rock on Wisconsin :-) 
Hello Wisconsin ! Missing it back home , but loving Bands of < PROPFEMALE > down in Illinois state university !! I'm getting pretty good at rifle , but there's always room to improve !!! Rock on Badger State :-) 
Wow , at bands of < PROPFEMALE > , today we'll be practicing with the < PROPFEMALE > Crown colorguard !!!! It'll be so fun ! Rock on Wisconsin , I'll be back :-) 
Wow , Music For All was amazing ! Rock on colorguard with your show today . See u next year ! 
As I passed Mt . < PROPFEMALE > , I read \honk if you love Jesus . \ " Beep " 
< PROPFEMALE > !!!!!!! YEAHH 
If love is a gun , i'll be pulling that trigger . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
How much wood could a wood < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > if a wood < PROPMALE > could < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ? All of it . 
First day of Band Canp and my true love sent to me ... One angry band director 
On the second day of Band Camp , my true love sent to me ... two out-of-sync drum majors and an angry band director 
Wow , Band Camp is fine , the part thatmakes it soooooooo frustrating ( besides the heat ) is being stuck with the guard team all the time . 1/2 of them are swearing up a storm , 1/2 is making fun of me and/or yelling at me . Lord , give me the strength ... 
On the third day of Band Camp , my true love sent to me ... three stressed out captains , two out-of-sync drum majors and and an angry band director . Day 2 was hard , hoping that Day 3 will go better . ( Maybe if after every time in sectionals , after we do a few songs everyone including our captains and coaches take around 7 minutes to get back in . * RAGE * 
\Who are you ? \ " \ " I'm the Doctor\ " \ " Doctor who ? \ " Exactly !!!!!! Loving it !!! " 
I was at the store and saw a 12-pack of Diet Pepsi < PROPMALE > . If you'd of come around the corner , you would have seen me singing \What is Love ? \ " and doing the headbop . Classic :-) " 
Yeah , Briqnic tonight ! Eat 100 lbs of ice cream to get TWO DAYS of free ice cream . Sweet deal , so you all start going to Briqs now . ( Go to Mosinee , I might be working ! ) 
Wow , I just got behind the wheel driving with my cousin < PROPFIRST > . So nervous but so fun :-) 
Band practice went good . Got the Spiderman charts down , only 2 to go . Yeah ... 
Wiffleball bat smash !!! 
Wow ! My mom and I were just baptized ... Still in shock .. Lord , you are great 
Still keeping on keeping on ... :-) 
With girls , work , and school making me want to cry , it's good to know I have the Lamb of God :-) 
Did you know you have about a day to get stitches before it gets serious . So you have about 24 hours to sew yourself up before your innards spill out . I guess that's one way to think about it ... :-) 
Yeah , pre-game tonight . Not excited , but I'll be smiling like a fool when I'm performing . 
Only you can prevent < PROPMALE > fires . I love you Smokey ! 
All heads are bowed in silence , to remember her last sentence . She hangs her head knowing what had happened , her last words still hanging in the air-Flyleaf 
I love you Nightmare !!!! :-) Fining it ironic that i gave pretty much the presonification of pure evil ( Besides Inferno ) a smiley face . Fear Soul Edge < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > !!! 
Loving how much better a day can get by being able to talk to a special someone :-) 
Roadhouse ... 
Despite the lies that you're making , your love is mine for the taking . \ 
My love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses\ 
I will be the one that's gonna hold you , I will be the one that you run to\ 
My love is a burning , consuming fire -Skillet . So beautiful 
In brightest day , in blackest night , No evil shall escape my sightLet those who worship evil's might , Beware my power ... Green Lantern's light ! 
Chocolate rain ... 
So nervous for Field show . But I know I got Jesus , so I'll think I'll make it :-) 
Some people deserve a kick . Others deserve a jump reverse side kick right into their jugular ... 
Looking at the school symbol during the assembly . \So they beat us with a gavel to get a music holder to make a scroll that you will saw to graduate ... With a hat :-) good stuff " 
So I'm missing Music in Motion for work , and might be getting fired too . Epic sad face :-( But I got to see my cousin play football , that was fun ! 
So , I kept my job but lost my position as colorguard captain over missing ONE show . Not happy with Mr. A right now . :-( 
I feel the darkness\ 
My heart bleeds and soul screams\ 
I need you now , Lord . ( Haiku ) 
\Beautiful bride 
Dear Lord , give me the strength to not strangle the people who scream at me ! 
Life : 2 legit 2 quit 
Please give me something , I’m so thirsty , I’m so thirsty . Oh please , let me warn them , Don’t you come here , don’t bring anyone here -Flyleaf 
We're watching TV on the radio ! 
< PROPFIRST > Gotham : \So who is winning ? \ 
Played \Dance or Die\ " for the Wednesday Fun Run . Nice !!! " 
Goofing around with friends . Throws play kick . Hears Mr. Wanta in the distance \Rechamber that kick\ " Wow ... " 
Going into a very dark place this weekend , could i get some prayers of protection please ? 
Here you are , down on your knees again , trying to find air to breathe again . And only surrender will help you now , see and believe ... -Flyleaf 
If anyone has a DC superhero costume ( Peferably batman , wonder woman , flash , green lantern ... ) wear it tomorrow for costume day , for we could be the Justice Leauge . If you don't know what the Justice Leauge is , chances are you probably don't have a costume . 
Going home to catch a chicken . I can honestly say that is the funniest reason why I have to ride the bus . 
We caught the chicken ! 
Vote For Batman 2010 ! 
Hands-free flushing , hands-free sink , hands-free soap , hands-free towel dispenser . Touches handle that every slob who didn't wash their hands touched . Anyone else see a problem ? 
Batman is the descriptive word of today . 
Writing Workshop : Comma hand gesture made my day . 
This is the last time I'll update my Facebook status with < PROPFIRST > Gotham in Study Hall . 
I made blue belt !!! 
We don't know how the bug died , but we can measure the rock . 
Chocolate rain IS raining in my brain 
Green Lantern trailer made me cry ... In disappointment . A CGi suit wastes money and looks stupid . 
Watching South Park destroys brain cells faster than drinking . 
I'm a duck and your a rock . I'm much better at floating on the sea . I'm a duck and your a rock . And your much better at breaking windows than me ... 
The word of the day is ... snarf ! 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > Wars IV . So lame but so epic !!! 
Next movie with < PROPFIRST > Donaldson and < PROPMALE > Donaldson in < PROPFEMALE > ... tomorrow ... laser tag ! 
It's official ; if you are reading this , you are not one of the many idiots who participate in Black Friday . Now if you get trampled by a mob of angry women , that is just ironic ... 
Two words : LASER TAG !!!!! 
Laser Tag was Epic !!!!!!! OMGosh , nothing like shooting people in the dark !!!! I'll upload a couple of pictures , but my camera lagged so they look bad 
Link , He come to town , \ 
Come to save , The < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , \

HALLELUJAH ! 
Wow , I just watched < PROPMALE > Gump for the first time . I have not seen a movie that good in a long time . I can't even express how awesome it was ... 
Got back from < PROPFEMALE > and arrived in a Wisconsin Winter Wonderland . Therefore I officially declare it ... scarf season !!!! 
Playing Cube Field and listening to Basshunter before Winter guard practice . Life can't any better than this ! 
I will never be afraid again .. \ 
I will keep on fighting ´till the end .. \ 
I can walk on water , I can fly .. \ 
I will keep on fighting ´till I die - ? Basshunter 
You are my light in the dark , \ 
You are the beating in my heart\ 
Let me hold you now , just like days before you start to cry\ 
But that is not enough . Will i ever be by your side ? -Basshunter 
Kew-Kew-cha-choo !!

Finished watching Season 3 of Smallville yesterday ... OMGosh , must convince mother to go rent Season 4 
Yeah ! Sledding tonight ! X-treme !!! 
Naming your child Atrocitus is really going to limit his career options ... -Comicvine 
It doesn't matter how high you think you're flying if all you do is going to plummet you to the ground . Oh that's deep ... 
Ugh ! Hate losing my voice ! If I could only remember where I put it ... Anywho , hope everyone who got a letter enjoyed it ! 
Made red belt !! 
Actually , I don't know any pretty rave girls , Basshunter . 
Can't wait for our first winter guard competition in Milwaukee !

Big words are dumb . 
So , going to Briq's pre-season get together tonight with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . Then I going to buy a fancy collared shirt and vest . Combining that with my bow tie , it's safe to say : I'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE !!! 
Rocked the bow-tie and vest today ... uber-excited about our Chicago Winter Guard Competition this weekend ! 
Rough night ... Could you be praying for the Winter Guard team , we really need it 
Woke up to the < PROPMALE > theme song this morning . Had to think of < PROPFIRST > Gotham 
Me : What's that ? < PROPFIRST > Schultz : A dead , skinned bear . Me : That's stupid , why would you kill it before you skinned it ? 
So glad to be over with History Day !!! 
Great day . No , wonderful day ! Finally got closure which was soooooo greatly needed . Guard was different , but okay . Great day overall ! 
For everyone testing for yellow or purple belt today , good luck ! 
Really in a bad place today , could you all be praying for me , please ? I really need it . 
Trust in the LORD with all your heart , and do not rely on your own understanding . -Proverbs 3:5 
I just want my banana hammer and you just trying to cramp my style , < PROPMALE > Piehl 
Good end to a horrible week ! 
Laser light ? Where ? 
Excuse me , but what dangerous < PROPFEMALE > life resides in that body of water ? Good times in Personal Defense ! 
The color of the day is Power Ranger . 
Baby , don't hurt me no more ... 
That's almost as messed up as having < PROPFIRST > Vick win the Iditarod ... 
Stop it that's segregation ; you are trying to separate my life from my body ! 
Totally wishes he was in Drum Corps International !

In brightest day , in blackest night , no evil shall escape my sight . Let those who worship evil's might beware my power ... Green Lantern's light !!!
