Thankfully it only took a few days for my bank's investigation to conclude . Apparently they realized , rather astutely on their part , that I did not , nor would I fucking EVER , purchase FIVE YEARS of World of Warcraft subscriptions in Europe .

Dog just ate a spider . \ 
Clawed it off the wall , then followed it around when it fell out of his mouth . \ 
Giant , brown spider leg stuck to his squished-in doggy face . \ 
Because the spider was a Brown Recluse , he gets Best Dog Ever .

I call for a new Holiday Tradition , while we all sit around stuffing our faces with awesome food : Instead of going on a masturbatory ego trip of how fantastic our own lives are , lets spend this day in remembrance , and humility , honoring the slaughtered masses that got us here . \ 
Would it help if I said it with a smile ? :) 
Anybody have experience with Grooveshark VIP subscription ? Apps , scrobbling , etc .? \ 
Would love to support them , but right now $30.00 ( a year ) is a lot to lay down on something other than X-mas related things ... 
I regret never going into The Lust Lady ( Seattle , WA ) . 
Sick of corporations and bureaucracy . Ready to move to the sticks ! 
Not having children was my choice . \ 
I will give up breeding , and go without\ 
to provide for the future of the planet . \ 
Pity the parents who choose \ 
to give up on their planet , and SELFISHLY ADD TO THE INCREASING OVER POPULATION . \ 
If you are proud of your ability to make rational decisions , and able to\ 
set aside your own desires , then Copy -&- Paste this as your status . \
