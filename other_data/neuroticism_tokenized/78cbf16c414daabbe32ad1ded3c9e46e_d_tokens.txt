feeling great ^-^ .. it been a while .. ^-^ 

things are getting better with me and a certain someone in my life ^_^ i hope it keeps going up .. on the other note im doing fine with my health and hope everyone else is too !!! 
taking life one step at a time ... probably will need to find a new place to live soon with < PROPFIRST > ... hopefully i will get a job soon ... 
Waiting for call back .. getting doubt ill acually get the job ... also news update on my relationship ... probably wont happen if she doesnt call by the 3rd ... so ill probably start getting over it . in a bit ... over 6 months of being single and trying to prove im better than i was .. has done nothing for me ... more dissapointment in my life .. awesome just what i needed right now .... 
hoping for my job call today .. and talking to alot of old friends trying to start back up my life that been on hold for 3 years .. also wouldnt mind some heat and sun . 
just woke up 4 hrs after going to sleep to a kitten swatting at my blanket , trying to make it stop , i sat up and fond out why . there was a huge ass 2 inch < PROPFEMALE > it had claws the wings off of , crawling all over me .... talk about jumping , if i had claws id probably be one of those cat of cartoons that stick to the cealing lol ... 
strougling with life day after day gives no encouragement to the loner i am ... got a few friends but the rest want nothing to do with me .. eventually try to get more but will take a long time to trust anyone new again .. still no call so i have to call wal-mart tomorrow to check up on things .... i hope i will be able to do the job well enough to keep it ... idk how much more disappointment i can take ... 
so i got a call this morning ... i passed out at 6:00 ... they called at 6:30 to see if i could make it into orientation but i never got her messege ... they said they would call me back for 2nd orientation but never said when ... awesome ... now im even more lost than before ... annd it probably doesnt look good on me seeing how i didnt pick up or go to the first one .... oh well time to wash cloths ... 
omg !! totally random and most think im weird for watching anime ... but this weeks episode of naruto sucked on graphics !!... last weeks was amazing graphics but the episode itself sucked because in the last 2 months their killing off like all the good characters ... * tear * and one of them was one of my favorite ones ... but good thing now though ... theyre finally introducing narutos dad yay !!!! 
nothing new so far ... just a boring day like always sitting here waiting for a call .. playing games and watching anime -the story of my life- ... not much to say besides me wanting someone- after 6 1/2 months i should be able to get someone- hopefully this time things wont go wrong like every other time in my life ... hopefully .. lol so just chillin waiting for my life to start , its all i can do right now .. 
just got in now at ... 12:09 am and been lighting fireworks since 9 lol ... still not done but had to save some for the kids lol ... bought some boxers and socks and fireworks with some money got 20 left and gave to tylers dad to help out . 
so only managed to get about 1hr of sleep after trying for 2hrs .. woke up cuz < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > were bitching about a guy being stupid on xbox live .. like he always is ... so now i cant get anymore sleep before i go to my job orientation at 7 .. sadface ... 
just woke up after passing out at 810 !! only woke up cuz < PROPFIRST > left the light on ... tsk tsk and all he said was oh wahh ... i got 7 till work ... then another 7hr orientation ... long day ahead of me ... i hope i can manage to not get tired before the end this time .. found an old friend that i may be able to date lol , but atm im still single * tear * lol

repairing the peices of my broken heart ... < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and my parents ... thank you for being there when all i wanted to do was cry my life away .... =] 
getting through a day of work is proving harder than ever ... they decide to overwork me and get mad when i cant do everything at once ... getting called to all four corners of the store as well as carts and carry-outs ... when im the only one on .... damn i fucking hate that walmart is too damn lazy and stingy to hire more stock-man ... let alone actually give them hours ....

so im a really paraniod person ... and found out my tatto is getting worse by the day ... its ganna end in a really faded black/ gray instead of just black ... and that im going to have to get it redone ... sucky for me cuz i was really hoping it would go smoother than it is ........ 
2 days of heavy lifting finally complete for me and tylers part .. so im sore , tired . and just sitting back relaxing now . yayy ... planning on calling < PROPFEMALE > soon ... hope shes home .... 
well my day was awesome !!!.... couldnt see < PROPFEMALE > . talking with someone i shouldnt have ... even more sore than i was yesterday ... got ditched during trick or treating ... and now bored at home .... yupp my day just couldnt get better .... NOT !!!!! 
hmmm lets see ... computer that im waiting on to be fixed ... an xbox that is completely useless ... a gf that i have only seen once in almost 2 months ... being bored as hell back at home ... barely able to sleep ... all while im trying to find another job and get back into school .... jeeze shit is great .... 
my heart is aching , my soul divided , my body feels heavy and the depression regaining . another mistake in life i wish i could take back . the one person i want to talk to is stressed because of me .... if only i could turn back time so i could keep my mouth shut and do things differently ...... =( 
You can never predict whats going to happen in the future . and you can only try to prevent the things that you think will happen . to live life is one thing , and to survive it is another . be proud of where you are , for just imagine if you werent the one fighter of millions ... you wouldnt exist to expirience anything at all . 
the goofy pig that tells you the show is over on a WB cartoon show 
wooww .. this is fucking awesome ... an xbox that nobody can fix ... a computer that nobody can fix ... and sitting at home all day , everyday bored as hell because of there being nothing to fucking do .... this shit is fucking AWESOMEE !!!!!!!! 
i will sit and wait for my < PROPMALE > to be happy , to find my < PROPFEMALE > dancer ... and live my life accordingly from there ... but in the meantime i guess its my music and anything i can find that i have to count on to keep me preoccupied .... * sigh * 
Change your profile picture to one of your favorite childhood cartoon characters and ask your friends to do the same . The point of the game ? To have no human faces on Facebook only childhood memories by Monday to fight child abuse . Copy and paste to spread the word ! 
You and I wake up in jail together . Using ONLY 4 words , what do you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status so I may comment on yours as well . 
wish list : 2 pillows , queensize matress pad(LAST 2 ARE A BIG WANTING ) , pajama pants and eltric heating blanket . i will keep updating as i find out more . 
curling up and licking the wounds . howling at the broken < PROPFEMALE > . laying down in the shadows watching those in the light enjoy the peace they have . never knowing the peace was given to them at the cost of ones soul ... would they be < PROPFEMALE > happy if they knew the truth behind their happiness ?? would they think different of the world around them ?? would they care ??... The price of being with the court of elders ... 
there are 3 categories to people\ 
1 : not giving about what happens and going with the flow , trusting people you dont know . \ 
2 : thinking everything through , and allowing people to do what they will and ask questions later . \ 
3 : and finally . my way . where you dont trust anything , suspecting everything and everyone to only do things that benefit them , and only trusting them when they prove otherwise . 
hmmm cant wait for friday , should be amazing !!! an amazing girl ? sleeping in me bed no less ?? heheheh sooo cant wait 
bored at home ... any suggestions on what to do ???? 
wishing that i could just set my own little world into reality ... allowing others to see what i see when i space off into my bubble ... i wonder what they would do if they knew what i really imagine doing to them ... hahhahaha funny thought ... < PROPFEMALE > many people staring in awe over the incredible scenes ... hmmmm off i go into my bubble again rofl 
been up since 7:30 after going to bed at 11:30 last nihgt . haha surprising never would have thought it would happen hahaha now to continue through my day 
i find myself staring at the same two pages on line : facebook , and gaia . bored as always and wondering why i cant find anything fun to do .. even with the billions of sites on the web .. im still stuck sitting here on the same ones doing nothing .... 
hahaha so ive changed my mind .. instead of inflicting my own little world upon the real world .. i would rather have them enter my world .. where the laws and physics of the real world are to what i want instead of what they really are ... rofl 
sooooo ready for my love life to move forward ... instead of being frozen here in time where all im good for is a night of fun and a < PROPFEMALE > out < PROPMALE > .... my heart longs to be held and i long for < PROPMALE > solid proof that im not a toy .. that i wont be here for much longer ... 
fuck my life ... fuck the world ... i just lost her again and my second < PROPMALE > ... now shes with someone else and i cant do anything about it ..... she says she wanted me that he was ready but it was never made clear that she was ..... and now i feel dead inside once again ... and once again lost the love of my life .... FML 
needing a day to just let loose ... to forget about everything and have fun .. to just say fuck you to everything that wants to ruin my mood ... and to not care about anything .. doing things that make me happy .... my true fuck the world day ..... 
I would like my Facebook friends to comment on this status , sharing how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right , just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status , so I can do the same . I bet half won't read the instructions right . 
I see you walking home alone , your face is alive and bright\ 
But you can't see how weak you are ' cause I could end it tonight\ 
It's the feeling you get when you think that someone behind is watching you\ 
Well I can tell you now , that someone is me and I'm about to make it right 
my life is like an hourglass .. the more the bottom is filled with sand the better my life .. and right when i think everything is going well and there is no more sand left to fall ... someone tips it over and my whole world turns on me ... broken-heart , shitty school , no money , no job , no car , friends lost , and lost in a void of my mind ... one thing is though .. the sand wont start flowing again without someone there .. 
..... i need a hug .... 
wishing there was a bucket full of pieces of paper that had the names of decent women i could have a relationship with ... and that all i had to do , is close my eyes , reach in , and grab one of them . and from there , try to make things work as best as possible . to make her happy and get myself out of this hole i have dug for myself .
